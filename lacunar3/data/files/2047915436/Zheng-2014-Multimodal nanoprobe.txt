 Ischemic stroke accounts for 80% strokes and originates from a reduction 
of cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) after vascular occlusion. For treatment, the 
fi rst action is to restore CBF by thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue-type 
plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Although rt-PA benefi ts clinical outcome, its 
application is limited by short therapeutic time window and risk of brain 
hemorrhage. Different to thrombolytic agents, neuroprotectants reduce neurological
injuries by blocking ischemic cascade events such as excitotoxicity 
and oxidative stress. Nano-neuroprotectants demonstrate higher therapeutic 
effect than small molecular analogues due to their prolonged circulation 
lifetime and disrupted blood–brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic region. Even 
enhanced BBB permeability in ischemic territories is verifi ed, the pore size of 
ischemic vasculatures determining how large and how effi cient the therapeutics
can pass is barely studied. In this work, nanoprobes (NPs) with different
diameters are developed. In vivo multimodal imaging indicates that NP 
uptakes in ischemic region depended on their diameters and the pore size 
upper limit of ischemic vasculatures is determined as 10–11 nm. Additionally, 
penumbra defi ned as salvageable ischemic tissues performed a higher BBB 
permeability than infarct core. This work provides a guideline for developing
nano-neuroprotectants by taking advantage of the locally enhanced BBB 
permeability in ischemic brain tissues. 
and it originates from a lasting or transient
reduction in cerebral blood fl ow 
(CBF) that arises from the occlusion of 
a cerebral artery either by embolus or by 
other particle matters. [ 2 ]  In the management
of ischemic stroke, the fi rst line of 
action is to restore the CBF by intravenous 
injection of thrombolytic agent: recombinant
tissue-type plasminogen activator 
(rt-PA). As the only clinically approved 
drug for acute stroke treatment, rt-PA has 
been proved to dredge the occlusive vasculatures
, increase perfusion of ischemic 
regions, and preserve salvageable ischemic 
tissues. [ 3 ]  Although rt-PA benefi ts clinical 
outcome, [ 4 ]  its application in clinic is limited
by short therapeutic time window 
(within 3.0 h after ischemic symptoms) [ 5 ]
and potential risk of brain hemorrhage. [ 6 ]
Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies
with extended intervention time 
window and minimized side effects are 
urgently needed. 
 Ischemic cascade, starting with a severe 
focal reduction in CBF triggers a cascade 
of events in the ischemic region including 
depletion of energy compounds, excessive
activation of glutamate receptors, accumulation of intracellular
calcium cations, acidosis of intracellular environment, 
excessive production of free radicals, abnormal recruitment of 
infl ammatory cells, and initiation of pathological apoptosis, [ 7 ]
which are actively involved in ischemic damage. [ 8 ]  The interruption
of these cascades holds potential to protect the neurological
tissues from above ischemic damages. Neuroprotection 
aims to prevent the ischemic insults by blocking the deleterious 
ischemic cascade. Even though neuroprotective agents such 
as glutamate antagonists, [ 9 ]  ion channel modulators, [ 10 ]   antiinfl ammatory  agents, [ 11 ]  and free radical scavenges [ 12 ]   have 
been developed and showed pronounced therapeutic effects in 
preclinical studies, their clinical transformations were disappointing.[ 13 ]  One of the major reasons is the low brain delivery 
effi ciency of the neuroprotectants due to their short circulation 
lifetime. For example, compared with the native superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) with short resident time (≈6 min) in blood 
pool, [ 14 ]  SOD encapsulated in biodegradable poly( D,L -lactide   co -
glycolide, PLGA) demonstrated a higher reduction in infarct 
volume and increased survival rate by eliminating the free

oxidative radicals. [ 15 ]  Therefore, the development of nanosized 
neuroprotective agents or drug delivery vectors holds promise 
to achieve improved therapeutic effi ciency. 
 As a unique physiological structure of the blood vessels in 
the brain, blood–brain barrier (BBB) precisely regulates the 
movement of molecules between blood and brain and maintains
a precisely controlled microenvironment for neuronal 
circuits, synaptic transmission, and neurogenesis. [ 16 ]  Due to 
the low permeability of BBB, overwhelming majority of small 
molecular drugs and almost all macromolecular pharmaceutics
cannot reach brain tissues. [ 17 ]  The acute ischemia results in 
local BBB permeability enhancement, which can be explained 
by the disruption of tight junctions (TJs) [ 18 ]  that are zipper-like 
seals between adjacent endothelial cells [ 19 ]  and restrict the entry 
of blood-borne substances into brain. The compromised BBB 
tightness in ischemic region results in brain damages such 
as edema and hemorrhagic transformation. [ 20 ]  On the other 
hand, the leaky BBB provides the opportunity for delivery of 
the drugs, especially the nanoparticle-based therapeutics. Even 
though the BBB opening dynamics in ischemic regions were 
systemically studied, [ 21 ]  as far as we know, the physiologic pore 
size of ischemic vasculatures that determines how large and 
how effi cient the nanoparticles can pass is barely studied. [ 22 ]
Elucidating the vascular pore size up-limit in ischemic regions, 
especially in penumbra that is referred to the “salvageable” 
tissue [ 23 ]  will provide a guideline for development of nanoparticle-based
neuroprotective agents by taking advantage of the 
enhanced BBB permeability in the ischemic regions. 
 Magnetic resonance imaging is widely used for ischemic 
stroke diagnosis due to its noninvasiveness, the ability to offer 
anatomic information with high spatial resolution and the 
feasibility to characterize the etiology and pathophysiology. [ 20 ]
Meanwhile, the unrivaled advantages of optical imaging stem 
from its ability to monitor the biological events with detection 
sensitivity at molecular or cellular level for providing functional 
information. [ 24 ]  To determine the physiologic pore size of vasculatures
in the ischemic regions, a series of dendrimer-based 
nanoprobes (NPs) with diameters in a range of 3.3–14.8 nm 
was developed. The conjugation of both paramagnetic chelators 
and fl uorophores on the NPs helps to elucidate
the pore sizes of vasculatures in infarct 
core as well as penumbra area by noninvasively
quantifying their brain uptake effi ciencies
after their extravasation from the leaky 
vasculatures ( Figure 1  ).   
  2.      Results 
  2.1.      Design,  Synthesis,  and  Characterization 
of the NPs 
 Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as 
multigenerational polymers were chosen as 
scaffolds of NPs due to their globular architecture
, identical molecular weight, and welldefi ned reactive groups on surface. [ 25 ]   With 
each successive generation, the number 
of reactive groups on dendrimer surface 
doubles and the overall diameter increases by 1–2 nm. [ 26 ]
Previous reports demonstrated that the pore size upper limit 
in brain tumor vasculatures is about 12 nm. [ 27 ]  By hypothesizing
the similar magnitude of vascular pore sizes between 
ischemic lesion and brain tumor, NPs were prepared by using 
PAMAM dendrimers with generation from 2 to 6. The modifi cation of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) not only improves the 
biocompatibility of the NPs but also minimizes the nonspecifi c 
tissue binding by shielding the surface charge on the NPs. To 
improve imaging sensitivity, multiple copies of paramagnetic 
Gd-DTPA chelators were labeled on the NPs via physiologically
inert amide bonds. Meanwhile, near-infrared (NIR) fl uorophore
IR783 was conjugated to track the NP uptakes in vivo 
because tissue absorption and autofl uorescence in NIR wavelength
region (650–900 nm) are low, which allows the NIR light 
to penetrate into deep tissues. [ 28 ]  Additionally, the labeled rhodamine
helps to track the NPs in excised brain tissues under 
fl uorescence microscope because the NIR fl uorophore cannot 
be excited well by conventional fl uorescence microscope. 
 The general synthetic procedure of the NPs is described in 
Scheme 1  .  mPEG 2K -NHS ester (3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 25.6, and 51.2 
molar equivalences to G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6 dendrimer, 
respectively) dissolved in anhydrous DMF was added dropwise 
to the dendrimer (1.0 mmol) in 2.0 mL PBS (pH 7.4). The mixture
was allowed to react for 1.0 h at r.t. and purifi ed by gel 
column chromatography (GCC, Sephadex G25) using deionized 
water as mobile phase to give compound  1a – e .   1a – e  (0.9 mmol) 
in 3.0 mL sodium bicarbonate buffered solution (0.1  M , pH 9.5) 
reacted with DTPA dianhydride (12, 24, 48, 96, 192 equiv.). The 
pH of the reaction solution was maintained at pH 9.5 by adding 
NaOH solution (0.1  M ). The product labeled with multiple 
DTPA chelators ( 2a – e ) was purifi ed by GCC. Compound  2a – e

3a – e  (0.7 mmol) in 2.0 mL HEPES (pH 8.3) solution. After stirring
1.0 h at r.t., rhodamine-NHS ester (3.0 equiv.) in 50 µL 
anhydrous DMF was added. The dual-fl uorophore conjugated 
dendrimers were purifi ed by GCC respectively to offer the fi nal 
products  5a – e.
 The physical parameters of the NPs were demonstrated in 
Table 1  . The hydrodynamic diameters of the NPs correlated with 
the dendrimer generation and increased from 3.3 nm of G2-P to 
14.8 nm of G6-P (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). Every NP 
migrated as a single band in fl uorescence images of the sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGEs), 
which indicated their purities (Figure S1B, Supporting Information
). Notably, the migration distances of the NP bands decreased 
with dendrimer generation number, which can be interpreted by 
the increased molecular weights. All the migration bands in NIR 
and rhodamine fl uorescence images colocalized well with each 
other, which verifi ed the dual-fl uorophore conjugation on the 
NPs.  1 H NMR spectroscopy indicated that averagely 10% primary 
amines on the NPs were modifi ed with PEG. Meanwhile, the 
molar ratios between Gd 3+ -DTPA chelators and primary amines 
on the NPs were measured in a range of 20%–30%. Moreover, 
the average longitudinal relaxivity  r
1p
  of the labeled Gd 3+   chelators
enhanced with the generation and the values increased 
from 2.7 m M
−1   s −1 /Gd 3+  of G2-P to 8.8 m M
−1   s −1 /Gd 3+  of G6-P. 
Averagely 2–4 IR783 and rhodamine fl uorophores were labeled 
on the NPs, which makes them sensitive enough to be visualized
by in vivo optical imaging (Figure S2, Table S1, Supporting 
Information). 
  2.2.      The  Particle-Size-Dependent  NP  Uptakes  in  Ischemic 
Regions 
 The ischemic stroke models were developed in nude mice 
underwent a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion 
(MCAO) via photochemically induced strategy. [ 29 ]  The ischemic 
lesion defi ned by T2W-MRI distributed in large part of cortex 
(from primary motor and sensory cortices to the end), striatum
and nucleus accumbens of the right brain hemisphere. 
Remarkably, the ischemic location and volume were highly 
reproducible in the mouse models, which benefi ted to accurately
evaluate vascular pore size in ischemic regions.  Figure 2  A  
demonstrated the representative T1W MR images of the mouse 
brains before and at selected time post-injection (PI) of NP via 
intravenous (i.v.) injection. Although no obvious MR enhancement
was observed after the administration of G6-P, other NPs 
performed obvious uptakes in the ischemic territories. In the 
fi rst 2 h PI, MR signals were observed in ventral pallidum and 
nucleuses below the striatum in the ipsilateral hemisphere.

G5-P were detected in the boundary between the cortex and 
striatum including claustrum, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, 
and ventral endoporiform nucleus at 12 h PI. At 24 h, MR signals
of G3, G4, and G5-P were found in the cortex and striatum 
of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The color-coded T1W-MR images 
showed that G4-P not only offered the highest signal enhancements
but also distributed in the largest volume in the ischemic 
territories. Figure  2 B demonstrated the time-dependent 
T1W-MR signal ratio between the ipsilateral and contralateral 
hemispheres after administration of NPs. Signifi cantly,  while 
the target to background (T/B) ratios of G4, G5, and G6-Ps 
increased consistently, the ratios of G2 and G3-P reached their 
maximal values at 2 and 12 h, respectively. The normalized T/B 
ratios at 24 h PI of the NPs were demonstrated in Figure  2 C, 
and they decreased with a sequence of G4-P> G3-P> G2-P >
G5-P > G6-P (mean ± SD,  n = 4).  
 The NP delivery effi ciency into ischemic regions was further 
investigated by in vivo NIR fl uorescence imaging.  Figure 3  A  
demonstrated representative in vivo NIR fl uorescence images of 
ischemic mouse models at selected time points after the injection
of NP via i.v.. All NPs visualized the ischemic region located 
at the ipsilateral hemisphere. While the T/B ratios of G4, G5, 
and G6-Ps increased consistently with time, the values of G2 and 
G3-P reached their maximal values at 4 h PI (Figure  3 B). Above 
experimental result was verifi ed by ex vivo NIR fl uorescence 
images of brains that were excised at 2 and 24 h PI (Figure  3 C). 
While strong fl uorescence signals of G2, G3, and G4-P in the 
ischemic regions were detected at 2 h PI of NPs, there were little 
signals of G5 and G6-P to be observed. In contrast, when the 
signals of G2 and G3-P remarkably decreased at 24 h PI, the fl uorescence
signals of G4 and G5-P increased substantially compared
to the values at 2 h PI. Quantitative studies demonstrated 
that all of the NPs, except G2-P, showed higher T/B ratio at 24 h 
PI compared to the values at 2 h PI (Figure  3 D). G4-P demonstrated
the highest T/B ratio at 24 h PI. 
  2.3.     Pore Size Upper Limit of BBB in Infarct Core and Penumbra 
 Due to the heterogeneity of CBF within the ischemic regions, 
tissues far away from collateral supply and exposed to the 
most severe reduction of CBF are referred to the infarct core 
where the damages are irreversible. Tissue at the periphery of 
the infarct core with a less severe reduction in CBF is defi ned

as ischemic penumbra where the prompt restoration of CBF 
can recover its neurological function. Saving the penumbra 
shows crucial clinical relevance because its salvage correlates 
to the therapeutic effi ciency. [ 30 ]  The location of infarct core and 
penumbra in ischemic mouse brain was delineated by triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, Nissl staining, and 
immunohistochemical staining, respectively. The location of 
infarct core in the cortex of ipsilateral hemisphere was fi rst 
indicated by TTC staining that distinguished the metabolically 
inactive/necrotic tissues as pale color (Figure S3A, Supporting 
Information). Nissl staining further verifi ed the infarct core 
location with characteristic triangularly shaped and deep blue 
stained neurons due to the condensation of cytoplasm and karyoplasm[ 31 ]   ( Figure   4 A, Figure S3B, Supporting Information). 
Meanwhile, the inducible heat shock protein HSP70 was widely 
used as a marker for penumbra due to its restrict expression in 
the peri-lesional neurons. [ 32 ]  The HSP70 positive cells shown 
as brown color and shuttle shaped morphology were observed 
in the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus of 
the ipsilateral hemisphere that were indicated as the ischemic 
penumbra (Figure  4 B, Figure S3C, Supporting Information). 
NIR fl uorescence microscopic images of the ischemic brain 
sections demonstrated that: 1) higher NP uptakes in the ipsilateral
hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere; 
2) higher NP uptakes in penumbra than the infarct core; 3) 
particle-size-dependent NP uptakes in both infarct core and 
penumbra (Figure  4 C). Quantitative studies demonstrated that 
while the normalized NIR fl uorescence intensities of NPs were 
determined with a sequence of G4-P > G3-P > G2-P >> G5-P 
> G6-P in the penumbra, the sequence was changed to G3-P >
G4-P > G2-P > G5-P >> G6-P in the infarct core (Figure  4 D). 
Moreover, the fl uorescence signals of G2, G3 and G4-P in the 
penumbra were higher than in the infarct core. Notably, there 
was not any NP signal detected in the contralateral hemisphere 
regardless of their particle size, which confi rms the extremely 
low permeability in the nonischemic brain tissues (Figure S3D, 
Supporting Information). 
  2.4.     Higher BBB Permeability in Penumbra Compared to Infarct 
Core 
 To investigate the BBB permeability in the ischemic regions, 
the brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) were immunohistochemically
stained by CD31 antibody at 24 h PI of the 
NPs. Confocal fl uorescence microscopic images indicated the 
remarkable rhodamine fl uorescence of G3, G4, and G5-NP in 
the penumbra areas ( Figure 5  A, upper panel). While most of 
the G3-P dispersedly distributed in the extravascular space, 
G5-P predominately located in the vessels. Notably, G4-P was 
found in both intra- and extravascular spaces. In the infarct 
core, even the fl uorescence of G3, G4, and G5 was evident, 
most of them colocalized well with vasculatures, which indicates
the low extravasation degree of the NPs (Figure  5 A, low

uptake of the NPs was observed in normal brain tissues regardless
of their particle sizes (Figure S4, Supporting Information). 
Figure  5 B shows the colocalization coeffi cients between the 
NPs and brain vasculatures in the penumbra and infarct core 
at 24 h PI. Interestingly, while the colocalization coeffi cients 
of G3, G4, and G5-P in penumbra increased consistently from 
0.57 ± 0.06 to 0.86 ± 0.07, the data of all these three NPs were 
above 80% in the infarct core. The colocalization coeffi cients of 
G2-P and G6-P kept below 30% in both penumbra and infarct 
core, which can be explained by their low uptakes in ischemic 
region.    
  3.      Discussion 
 Understanding of the physiological pore size of vasculatures 
is important to optimize the delivery of imaging/therapeutic 
agents. During the past years, the permeability of vasculatures 
to blood borne molecules has been systemically studied. [ 33 ]   For 
example, the average pore size of capillaries in normal brain, 
skeletal muscles, and kidney glomerulus were measured as 0.5, 
5, and 15 nm, respectively. [ 33 ]  The leakage of vasculatures is 
widely observed under pathological conditions due to the disorganized
endothelial cells and the degradation of the basal membrane.[ 34 ]  For example, the pore size in human brain tumor 
vasculatures was determined around 12 nm [ 27a ]  and the values 
of peripheral tumors even reached micrometer range. The 
enhanced permeability of tumor vasculatures has been widely 
used to delivery macromolecular agents for cancer therapy. [ 35 ]
Similarly, the increased BBB permeability in the ischemic 
lesions will offer the opportunity to specifi cally deliver the 
neuroprotective agents. However, as far as we know, the pore 
size upper limit of BBB in ischemic territories, especially the 
“salvageable” penumbra has not been investigated. The elucidation
of above question will pave the way for the development 
of nanosized neuroprotective agents with improved delivery 
effi ciency. 
 PAMAM dendrimers are branched, multilayer, and synthetic 
polymers with uniform size and molecular weight for each generation.
By choosing the dendrimer with suitable size and precisely
manipulating the functional groups, it is possible to tune 
the biocompatibility and pharmacokinetics of resulting NPs. [ 25b ]
Compared with native dendrimers that usually increase 1–2 nm 
in diameter with each successive generation, [ 27a ]  the hydrodynamic
diameters of the NPs actually increased 1–4 nm, which 
can be explained by the multiple water molecular spheres surrounding
the labeled Gd 3+   center. [ 36 ]  Notably, only 50%–60% 
labeled DTPA chelators were complexed with Gd 3+  ions even 
a large excess of Gd 
2
 (CO 
3
 ) 
3
  was treated. The phenomenon was 
reported previously and can be explained by the coordination 
between a single Gd 3+  ion and two or more adjacent DTPA 
chelators. [ 37 ]  The T1 relaxivity of a Gd 3+ complex is primarily 
determined by: 1) the number of water molecules  q   directly 
coordinated with Gd 3+  ion; 2) the rotational correlation time 
τ
R
  of the agent (how fast the chelator rotates) and 3) the residence
lifetime of Gd 3+  bound water molecule  τ
M
  (how fast the 
exchange rate). [ 38 ]  The generation-dependent relaxivity enhancement
of the NPs (from 2.7 to 8.8 m M
−1   s −1 /Gd 3+ ) can be attributed
to the increased  τ
R
  values of the bulky NPs. Moreover, 
the lower relaxivites of Gd 3+  chelators in the NPs (maximally 
8.8 m M
−1   s −1 /Gd 3+ ) compared to the reported dendrimer-based 
MR agents (13.9–26.9 m M
−1   s −1 ) [ 37,39 ]  could be interpreted by 
1) the measurements under 7.0 T because of the magneticfi eld-dependent relaxivity according to the nuclear magnetic 
relaxation dispersion (NMRD) profi le [ 40 ] ; 2) the replacement of 
the Gd 3+ bound water molecules by negatively charged carboxylate
group from an adjacent uncomplexed DTPA chelators. [ 39b ]
 Middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the most commonly affected 
blood vessels in human ischemic stroke and MCAO animal 
model is the most widely used in preclinical studies. [ 41 ]   In 
this work, photothrombosis strategy was used to develop the 
MCAO model because of its advantages including minimized 
mechanical damage to cerebral blood vessels, the fl exibility to 
modulate lesion location, the low mortality of animals (≈5%), 
and high ratio of model establishment (100%). Additionally, the 
good reproducibility in infarct size and functional defi cit benefi t 
to accurately determine the pore size of ischemic BBB. In vivo 
MR and NIR optical imaging studies showed a close relationship
between the particle size and NP uptake effi ciency in the 
ischemic regions. Both G6-P with the largest diameter (14.8 nm) 
and G2-P with the smallest diameter (3.3 nm) showed the low 
uptakes, which can be explained by the bulky size of G6-P 
larger than the pore size upper limit of ischemic vasculatures 
and the rapid excretion of G2-P via renal fi ltration. [ 42 ]   Remarkable
uptakes of G3, G4, and G5-P in the ischemic regions attributed
to their prolonged circulation lifetime and their diameters 
below the pore size upper limit of ischemic BBB. According to 
the in vivo and ex vivo experimental results, the pore size upper 
limit in ischemic regions should be between the diameters of 
G5-P and G6-P and in a range of 10–11 nm. 
 Even though numerous studies have been made to assess 
the vascular permeability of tumors, [ 27a ]  as far as we know, there 
is very limited investigations evaluating BBB permeability in 
the ischemic stroke. Loss of blood supply in brain initiates a 
cascade of events including the increased production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), [ 43 ]  overexpression of proteases, [ 44 ]
and down-regulation of TJ-associated proteins, [ 18 ]  which jointly 
increase BBB permeability through the promotion of vascular
infl ammation, compromise of TJ tightness, degradation 
of basal membrane, and loss of the vasoregulatory capability. 
Previous work indicated the highest vascular permeability was 
within the infarct core because it suffers the greatest degree of 
TJ dysregulation and disassembly. [ 18 ]  However, in this work, 
even infarct core and penumbra demonstrated a similar vascular
pore size upper limit, penumbra indeed showed a higher 
BBB permeability than that in infarct core with the evidence 
of the earlier MR signal enhancement and higher NP uptake 
effi ciency. Above phenomenon could be explained by high 
CFB, active angiogenesis, and overexpression of caspases in 
penumbra. High CFB leads to the increased mass transfer rate 
through vascular wall, [ 45 ]  active angiogenesis generates the neovascultures
with enhanced permeability, [ 46 ]  and the caspases 
actively cleave TJ-related proteins in maintaining BBB tightness.[ 47 ]  Taking advantage of the higher vascular permeability in 
penumbra than that of normal neurological tissues and infarct 
core, it is possible to specifi cally deliver the nanosized neuroprotective
therapeutics into the “salvageable” penumbra by 
fi nely tuning their particle size.

 Even the disrupted BBB in the ischemic regions offers an 
opportunity for the entry of the nanosized therapeutics, the 
compromised drug delivery effi ciency is still the main obstacle 
for neuroprotective therapy because the drug concentration in 
the lesion is still less than the therapeutic threshold. How to 
specifi cally enhance BBB permeability in the ischemic regions, 
especially the penumbra is the next challenge to be overcome.
In our previous work, a two-order targeted brain tumor 
imaging strategy was put forward. [ 48 ]  The NP labeled with cyclic 
[RGDyK] peptides targeting α
V
β
3
  integrin and angiopep-2 peptides
targeting the lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 
was developed. This NP fi rst targets the tumor vasculatures 
and its increased concentration in endothelial cells facilitates its 
BBB traverse via LRP-mediated transcytosis. [ 49 ]  The BBB penetrated
NP further targeted brain cancer cells. In this way, brain 
tumor with a diameter less than 1.0 mm was visualized with 
high target to background ratio. Enlightening by the two-order 
targeting strategy, it is possible to label penumbra targeting 
ligands and BBB opening ligands on the NAs. The dual-labeled 
NP will fi rst accumulate in penumbra and then specifi cally upregulate
local BBB permeability. The targeted BBB opening 
in the ischemic site will benefi t to maximize the delivery effi -
ciency of neuroprotective agents and minimize the off-targeted 
side-effects.  
  4.      Conclusions 
 Since the fi rst thrombolytic agent rt-PA trial in 1995, more than 
160 clinical trials of the neuroprotective drugs have been tested, 
but none has shown clinical effi cacy. [ 50 ]  Although multiple reasons
lead to the failures, the low drug delivery effi ciency in the 
ischemic tissues is the main challenge faced by researchers. 
Nanoparticle-based neuroprotective agents with prolonged circulation
lifetime but smaller than the pore size upper limit of 
ischemic vasculatures hold the promise to improve the therapeutic
effi cacy. In this work, by developing NPs with different 
diameters and utilizing multimodal MR/optical imaging, the 
upper limit pore sizes of ischemic vasculatures were determined
in a range of 10–11 nm and the higher permeability in 
the penumbra than that in the infarct core was verifi ed. Importantly
, this work provides a guideline for development of nanosized
neuroprotectants with the capability to specifi cally deliver 
into ischemic lesions, especially the salvageable penumbra. 
This guideline holds the promise to improve the therapeutic 
effi ciency of ischemic stroke.  
  5.      Experimental  Section 
Materials : All chemical reagents were obtained from Aladdin Reagent 
(Shanghai, China) unless otherwise specified. PAMAM dendrimers 
were purchased from Weihai CY Dendrimer Technology Co., Ltd 
(Weihai, China). Rhodamine-NHS was purchased from Thermofisher 
Scientific (New York, USA). Rabbit anti-mouse CD31 primary antibody 
was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Alexa Fluo488-labeled 
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling 
Technology (Danvers, USA). Rabbit anti-mouse HSP70 primary antibody 
was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Switzerland). PEG–NHS 
was purchased from JenKem Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). DTPA–
dianhydride was obtained from TCI (Shanghai, China). IR783-NHS was 
prepared according to our previous work. [ 51 ]  Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal 
filter tubes (3000 and 10 000 MW cutoff) were from Millipore (Bedford, 
USA). 
Characterization : The purity of NPs was determined by SDS-PAGE. NP 
(50 µg) in treatment buffer was loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. 
Photographic and fl uorescent images of the resolved SDS-PAGE gels 
were acquired under IVIS Spectrum (Caliper PerkinElemer, USA) Imaging 
System (FOV = 13.6 cm, F/Stop = 2, bin = medium resolution, exposure 
time = auto). The molar ratios between dendrimer, PEG, and DTPA 
chelators in NPs were quantified by integrating the characteristic proton 
of dendrimer (3.3–2.2 ppm), PEG (3.6–3.7 ppm), and DTPA chelator 
(2.37 and 3.30 ppm) in  1 H NMR (Varian Mercury400 spectrometer, 
USA). The fl uorophore labeling degree was calculated according to 
standard curve method on UV-2401PC UV–vis spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, Japan). The absorbance of rhodamine and IR783 was 
measured at 548 and 775 nm. The hydrodynamic size distribution and 
Zeta potentials of NPs were determined by Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern 
Instruments Inc., USA) dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument after 
instrumental calibration. Gd 3+  concentrations of NPs were determined 
by a Hitachi P-4010 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Tokyo, Japan) with RF power at 1100 W and 
nebulizer gas fl ow at 0.9 L min −1 . The standard solutions with the Gd 3+
concentration of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 ppm were prepared and a 
calibration curve was made by plotting the corresponding signal peaks 
versus the Gd 3+  concentrations. The Gd 3+  concentrations of the NPs 
were determined by fitting the Gd 3+  peak intensity against the calibration 
curve. The longitudinal relaxivities of the NPs were determined at 7.0 T 
MRI coilaccording to the equation of  r
1p
= (1/ T
sample
  – 1/ T
PBS
 )/[Gd].  NP 
with five different concentrations was measured respectively. Plotting 
the (1/ T
sample
  – 1/ T
PBS
 ) values with corresponding Gd 3+   concentrations 
measured by ICP-AES offered the T1-weighted relaxivities. 
Animal Model of Ischemic Stroke : Male nude mice weighing 18–22 g 
were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium solution (0.03 mg kg −1 ) 
via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The anesthetized mouse was 
positioned on a plate. A 5-mm incision was made between the orbit 
and ear. Under an operating microscope, an incision was made by 
dividing the temporal muscle, and the right lateral aspect of the skull 
was exposed. The main trunk of the middle central artery (MCA) was 
visualized without a craniotomy. Rose bengal dissolved in saline with a 
concentration of 10 mg mL −1  was injected via caudal vein (0.5 mL). At 
2 min post dye injection, a laser beam of 0.1 mm diameter (Shanghai 
Laser & Optics Century Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) and 532 nm 
wavelength was stereotactically positioned onto the MCA for 3 min. 
Afterwards, the skin was sutured and T2-weighted images were acquired 
at 2 h after surgery to verify the establishment of ischemic stroke models. 
In Vivo MRI Studies : All MRI experiments were conducted on Bruker 
Pharmascan 7.0 T micro-MRI scanner (Bruker, Germany) using a 
transmit/receive quadrature volume radio frequency (RF) coil of an 
inner diameter of 38 mm. The mice were used for in vivo imaging at 8 h 
after ischemic stroke. In vivo MR images of mouse brain were acquired 
before and at selected time points after i.v. injection of NP in 150 µL PBS 
with T1 value of 60 ms via caudal vein. Animals were anesthetized with 
isofl urane (1.5–2% in 20% oxygen) and then positioned prostrate with 
head snugly inserted into a nose cone centered within the bore of the 
magnet. Respiration rate was monitored and mice were kept warm in 
heating pad. Fast spin echo T1-weighted anatomical scans using a 2 ×
2 cm field of view for 24 slices of 0.5 mm thickness through the brain 
were performed with TR = 574.9 ms and TE = 15.0 ms. ROIs contained 
the ischemic lesions and a corresponding region in the contralateral 
hemisphere. Contralateral ROIs were exactly matched in size and shape 
with respect to their ipsilateral counterparts. The color-coded MR 
images were processed by ImageJ 1.48a software. T1-weighted images 
were first fl ippedhorizontally followed by registering with the original 
MR images. After subtracting the MR signals in fl ipped images from 
the original images, the resulting images were pseudo-colored with 
signal intensity ranged from 0 to 5000. The color-coded images were 
finally overlaid on the original MR images after deleting the signals in 
contralateral hemisphere.

In Vivo Optical Imaging Studies : Fluorescence images of a whole 
mouse body and close-up image of brain areas were obtained using 
Maestro In Vivo Imaging System (CRi Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). A 
serial of images were acquired before and at selected time points after 
administration of NP via i.v. In vivo NIR fl uorescence images were 
acquired by using a band-pass excitation filter from 745 to 785 nm and 
a long-pass emission filter over 760 nm. The regions of interest were 
defined and quantified by using the instrument-equipped software 
(Maestro software, CRi). At 2 h and 24 h after administration of NPs, the 
mice were scarified and were perfused transcardially with PBS followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The whole brains were excised carefully 
and ex vivo NIR fl uorescence images were performed using the CRi 
imaging system with similar instrumental setting to the in vivo studies. 
Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride Staining : At 24 h after NP injection via 
i.v., mouse brains were carefully isolated and then frozen at −40 °C for 
30 min. Thereafter, the brains were sectioned into coronal slices with 
thickness of 2 mm by using a brain-sectioning block. The sections were 
stained with 0.1% TTC (Beyotime, China) solution at 37 °C for 30 min 
and then imaged by SONY DSC-W120 camera (SONY, Japan). 
Nissl Staining : The brains at 24 h after NP injection were harvested and 
preserved at 4% PFA for overnight and then transferred to 30% sucrose 
for 3 d at 4 °C. The brains were embedded in wax and sectioned coronally 
with a thickness of 4 µm. The slides were rehydrated and then incubated 
in the Nissl–thionin staining solution for 4 min and maintained under 
agitation. The slides were rinsed in distilled water for 2 min, progressively 
dehydrated in 70% alcohol (10 min), 95% alcohol (2–3 min), and fi nally 
100% alcohol (10 min). After cleared in xylene for 5 min, sections were 
mounted on glass slides using Aqua-Mount mounting media (Thermo 
Scientifi c) and cover-slipped. Photographic and rhodamine fl uorescence 
images of the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres of brain sections 
were collected and then quantifi ed by ImageJ software. 
Immunohistochemistry Staining : The paraffi n-embedded brain cryosections
were incubated in warm water bath (55 °C) for 5–10 min and in a 
mixture of 5% H 
2
 O 
2
  and 10% methanol (v/v) in PBS for 20 min and then 
blocked with IHC blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature (r.t.). 
After incubation with 100 µL HSP70 primary antibody (1:500 dilution) 
overnight at 4 °C, the slides were washed and incubated with100 µL 
Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1: 500 dilution). Last, incubated 
each section with 100 µL of DAB-chromogen solution for 1–5 min and 
immersed the slide in PBS and mounted with a coverslip and predried 
before the microscopic imaging. For CD31 antibody immunostainning, 
free fl oating sections were fi xed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and 
washed with PBS. Specimens were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% 
BSA for 1.5 h to block against nonspecifi c binding and to permeabilize the 
cell membranes to enable staining. Then, BSA/Triton X-100 was removed, 
and the brain sections were incubated with anti-CD 31 primary antibody 
(1:100 dilution, Abcam) with supplemental 0.3% BSA overnight at 4 °C. 
After washing, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbitAlexa 
Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) with supplemental 1% 
BSA for 1 h at room temperature; and the nuclear DNA was stained with 
DAPI (1:500 dilution). The fl uorescence images were processed by ZEN 
2012 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and colocalization of NPs and blood 
vessel was performed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. 
Statistical Analysis : Values are presented as mean ± SD when the 
sample number was above 4 ( n > 4).
