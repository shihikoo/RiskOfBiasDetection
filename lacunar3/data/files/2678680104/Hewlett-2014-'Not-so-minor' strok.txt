Patients with small, non-debilitating strokes often report a reduction in quality of life due to persistent cognitive
and emotional alterations. Stroke may directly damage limbic circuitry resulting in an impaired stress response,
however the possibility that this may in part explain the prevalence of stroke comorbidity with mood disorders
has yet to be determined. Here we systematically examine psychosocial consequences of prefrontal lesions
targeting the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using hormone assays and a behavioral test battery in adult
rats to probe whether a small stroke could alter stress behavior or response to psychosocial stress (chronic
mild stress (CMS) or subordination stress).
Minor stroke produced chronic hyperactivity in an open field but did not alter fear-related inhibition in the
elevated plus maze. Novelty-induced defecation was increased by the combination of CMS, subordination and
stroke. Anterior cingulate lesions alone increased distress vocalizations in the water maze. Interestingly, ACC
stroke caused hyper-secretion of porphyrin and long-term hormonal alterations that resulted in adrenal
hypertrophy and enhanced dexamethasone suppression of the HPA axis. We propose that this behavioral profile
is consistent with an animal model of post-stroke distress-like syndrome which could be useful in understanding
how stroke affects the capacity to cope with psychological stress.

Introduction
Despite increasing awareness of emotional difficulties after stroke,
patients that recover from initial sensory-motor impairments are designated
as having a ‘minor’ stroke (Fischer et al., 2010; Carlsson et al.,
2004) and are sent home with minimal follow-up. While there is presently
no consensus on what constitutes minor stroke, current recommendations
suggest that it best fits those patients that score≤1on
every National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) item and exhibit
normal consciousness or those that are discharged home and followup
at 3 months shows good outcome as reflected by a modified Rankin
Scale score of≤2(Fischer et al., 2010). However, despite a high level of
motor function, many people report that they have difficulty coping
with stress (Green and King, 2007). Mood disorders including anxiety
(Tellier et al., 2011), depression (Willey et al., 2010; Robinson and
Spalletta, 2010) and post-traumatic-stress-like symptoms (Bruggimann
et al., 2006) are common after stroke (Annoni et al., 2006), with 20–40%
of patients exhibiting significant emotional disturbance at 2-year
follow-ups (Rush et al., 2010). In addition to prolonged dependency
(Willey et al., 2010; Gillen et al., 2001; Santa et al., 2008), correlates of
post-stroke mood disorders include social isolation (Bernhardt et al.,
2004), cognitive impairment (Robinson et al., 1986; Ebrahim et al.,
1985), risk of relapse (Tellier et al., 2011) and increased mortality rate
(Robinson and Spalletta, 2010; Everson et al., 1998). It is possible that
damage to limbic circuits may play an important role in emotional
changes in these patients. Animal models have yet to be utilized to explore
this possibility since themodels mostcommonly used(e.g. middle
cerebral artery occlusion) mostly spare limbic brain regions.
The limbic forebrain forms a hierarchy of mammalian stressresponse
modulation (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009) and includes the
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus, each
commonly implicated in stress disorders. Rodents and non-human primates
exhibit significant behavioral alterations when limbic networks
are damaged, and indeed much of our understandingof neuroendocrine
stress regulation has been achieved using animal models (Ulrich-Lai
and Herman, 2009). Here we produce a small ischemic infarct primarily
affecting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the dorsal division of the

mPFC, to model the behavioralsequelaeof‘minor’strokeand determine
whether rats have an impaired capacity to cope with psychosocial
stressors as assessed with a sensitive behavioral test battery and HPA
axis assays. The ACC is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
and while stroke affecting the ACA is relatively rare, occurring in
about 1.5–3% of the stroke population, the effects are devastating,
resulting primarily in emotional and cognitive dysfunction (Arboix
et al., 2009; Kumral et al., 2002). Our overall goal was to develop a
model of minor stroke involving the ACC in which cognitive and
emotional disturbances predominate since preclinical studies focus almost
exclusively on sensory-motor function. The establishment of such
a model could prove useful in developing therapeutic interventions to
improve cognitive and psychosocial impairments in stroke patients.
Materials and methods
Subjects and surgery
All studies utilized 2–3 month old male, pair-housed Sprague–
Dawley rats maintained on a 12 h reverse day–night light cycle with
1 wk acclimation to housing and handling before testing.
Study I— does ACC stroke result in motor impairments?
Six rats obtained from the Memorial University vivarium weighing
~300 g underwent baseline motor assessment and stroke, and then
were sacrificed for histology two weeks following surgery (see below
andFig. 1).
Study II— does ACC stroke result in stress-related impairments?
Pairs of rats (N = 40, Charles River, Montreal, Canada) were randomized
to the sham (Sham) or ischemia (Stroke) surgery so as to
have cage mates with the same conditions (Arboix et al., 2009). Animals
were food restricted for 8–12 h prior to surgery. One microliter of the
vasoconstrictive peptide endothelin-1 (Hewlett and Corbett, 2006)
(400 pmol/μl) was injected over 5 min at each of the following three
coordinates: 1.) +4.0 mm anteroposterior (AP), +0.7 mm mediolateral
(ML),−4.0 mm dorsoventral (DV); 2.) +2.7 mm (AP), +0.7 mm (ML),
−4.3 mm DV; 3) +1.2 mm (AP), +0.7 mm (ML), and−3.0 mm (DV)
with respect to bregma. Depth coordinates were determined from cortical
surface. SHAM surgery consisted of drilling the skull under anesthesia
without any brain injections. Core temperature was maintained
at ~36.5 °C using a self-regulating heating blanket (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA, USA). All efforts were made to minimize suffering and
reduce the number of animals used. All experimental procedures were
approved by the Memorial University Animal Care Committee in
accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian Council of
Animal Care.
Chronic mild stress. Following stroke, patients spend the majority of
theirtimeinactiveandalone( Bernhardtetal.,2004 ). To simulate
these conditions in our chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm,
cage mate pairs of animals were randomly assigned to social
isolation whereby rats were placed individually in a mouse cage
(12cm× 18cm× 29cm)for6h/d,5d/wk,for3wk(CMS +), or
handling control (CMS−) with 3 min/d in the cage. The study used
4groups:Sham –CMS− (n = 10), Sham–CMS+ (n =10),Stroke –
CMS− (n = 10), and Stroke–CMS+ (n = 10).
Social role. When housed in pairs adult male rats establish stable
dichotomies of dominance and subordination (Blanchard et al.,
1993; Timmer and Sandi, 2010; Bartolomucci, 2007). We asked
whether social role (SR) interacts with minor stroke to alter stress
behavior. Five months post-stroke SR was determined for each cage
of animals by video recording from two angles (top and side)
under dim illumination in a cage with fresh bedding between 1200
and 1600 h. Social interaction was encouraged by separating cage
mates 24 h prior to filming. Rats were distinguished by marking
one on the hood and one on the abdomen with a permanent, non-toxic
marker (Kumral et al., 2002). Common dominant behaviors such as chasing
, mounting, aggressive grooming and other behaviors (Kumral et al.,
2002; Westenbroek et al., 2005; Hewlett and Corbett, 2006)werecompared
to subordinate behaviors such as freezing, supine position during
interaction, audible vocalizations and upright defensive boxing (Kumral
et al., 2002; Blanchard et al., 1993; Timmer and Sandi, 2010). Frequency
and duration of behaviors were measured for each 10 min encounter
by an experimenter blinded to treatment condition. Each animal was
assigned a cumulative score for dominant and subordinate behaviors as
follows: Dominant score = (duration mounting + duration aggressive
grooming + frequency of offensive boxing + (lateral attacks + other
attacks + bites)*3); Sub score = (duration of freezing behavior + duration
in supine position + frequency of defense boxing + (# of vocalizations
*3)). Dominant rats were assigned as the rat with the greater
dominant score relative to the cage mate (Kumral et al., 2002).

Behavioral battery.Each test was conducted according to the timeline in
Fig. 1. Efforts were made to test under low-lighting conditions in
pseudorandom order.
Motor assessment.Skilled reaching behavior and forelimb asymmetry
were evaluated using the staircase and cylinder tests at baseline
and 2 wk following stroke as described previously (Bartolomucci,
2007; Blanchard et al., 1988). Successful reaches were calculated as average
number of pellets eaten over four test trials. Forelimb asymmetry
scores were calculated for the ipsilesional forelimb as: (ipsilateral contacts
+ 1/2 bilateral contacts) / total contacts × 100%.
Open field.Animals were placed in the center of a 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.5 m
open-field for each 10 min trial while their activity was tracked by an
overhead surveillance camera. Before testing animals were acclimated
to a nearby dark holding room forN45 min and the test apparatus was
cleaned between trials. Videos were analyzed using custom image
tracking software which sampled subjects' coordinates every 200 ms
to generate a coordinate-based trace. Total distance and number of
rears were recorded.
Elevated plus maze (EPM).The EPM was 0.5 m from thefloor with a
closed arm measuring 0.5 m long × 0.1 m wide × 0.4 m high. The
open arm was symmetrical but had no vertical lip. EPM testing occurred
2 min after thefirst openfield trial in the same room. Rats were placed
in the center of the EPM facing an open arm and left undisturbed for
5 min while their activity was tracked using an overhead surveillance
camera. Rears, open and closed arm entries, time spent per arm and
number of fecal boli (Albert et al., 1986; Raab et al., 1986) were 
recorded.
Morris water maze (MWM)—acquisition.Rats were tested in a novel,
dimly lit room with high contrast distal cues (alternating or constant
miniature lights) using methods reported previously (Langdon
et al., 2013). Quadrant sequence (two each of N, E, S, W) was
pseudorandomized for 8 trials/d for 4 d with an inter-trial interval
of ~3 min. Animals were placed in an empty cage between trials. If
the 20 cm diameter platform was not located within 90 s the rat
was placed on it for 10 s before being removed. The water was maintained
at ~21 °C. Latency to find the platform was video recorded
from above and trials were averaged across days for analysis.
Morris water maze—probe trial. To examine long-term memory
(LTM) a single 60 s probe trial was given 48 h following the end of acquisition.
The platform was removed from the pool and subjects were
randomly placed in one of four quadrants. The number of passes
through a target zone, defined by a concentric circle 2.2 times the diameter
of theplatform surroundingitsprevious location,was used to index
LTM.
Distress scores
Vocalization score. Animals (N = 20) were scored for distress
vocalizations (Burn et al., 2006) during the MWM probe trial by a
blinded experimenter while placing the animal in the pool. Animals
were given“0”for no vocalizations, or“1”for one or more discrete cries.
Porphyrin hypersecretion. Approximately one week prior to sacrifice
an experimenter blinded to treatment condition scored a subset of animals
(N = 20) for the absence (0), or presence (1) of chromodacryorrhea
(Burn et al., 2006; Buccafusco, 1990; Santos and Carlini, 1988 ), the
hypersecretion of porphyrin. Animals were examined for (i.) dense red
porphyrin in excretion areas of the nasolacrimal duct (i.e. below the
nose or around the eyes); (ii.) dense deposits noted as focal dark patches
of porphyrin typically seen in areas immediate to grooming such as across
the face, bilaterally on the posterior forearms, or in dense patches on the
hood, and (iii.) large areas of thinly spread porphyrin appearing dark pink
covering the dorsum of the head, nape of neck, or hood etc., indicating
that the animal had spread large amounts while grooming. Small patches
of light pink pigment on the hood or nape of neck are commonly observed
and were distinguished from excessive secretion.
Dexamethasone suppression test (DST). The tail was warmed in 40 °C
water for 30 s before removing 2 mm of the tip with a clean razor
blade. The ~500 μl blood sample for baseline corticosterone (CORT;
1030–1130 h) was collected in a serum separator tube (BD Microtainer,
BDC, NJ, USA). All blood collection took place under red light inb2min.
DEX (100 mg/kg) was immediately injected i.p. and bloodletting was
repeated 4 h later. Tubes were set to clot for 30 min then spun to
avoid haemolysis. Serum was decanted off and frozen until assayed.
Timing and DEX suppression dose were based on pilot studies of diurnal
CORT variation in our colony during the dark phase. DEX suppression
ratio (Biernaskie and Corbett, 2001) = [afternoon CORT] / [baseline
CORT]∗ 100%.
Steroid assays. Competitive radioimmunoassay was used to quantify
serum CORT (ng/ml; Coat-A-Count, DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA) as per
manufacturer's protocols. Unknown samples were compared, in duplicate
, to a known standardized curve and corrected for non-specific
binding.
Tissue collection and preparation. During sacrifice adrenal glands were
carefully dissected out prior tofixation and weighed (dry with capsid
intact) using an analytical scale. A subset of animals (N = 20) were
transcardially perfused with 4% PFA for detailed histology. Needle placement
and extent of injury was verified for all operated animals.
Statistics
Study I
Motor function data were analyzed with a paired t-test, Study II,
where N = 40, a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA (Surgery × CMS × SR) was applied
with or without repeated measures as appropriate. Fecal boli counts
were analyzed with a Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Mann Whitney
U tests. Post-hocs were performed using Bonferroni-corrected t-tests.
Vocalization and porphyrin scores (N = 20) were compared with a
one-tailed Mann Whitney U test and with Fisher's Exact test, respectively,
on the second cohort of animals. Statistical significance was set atα=
0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Results
Infarct location and volume
Infarcts (n = 10) extended from bregma to ~4.5 mm anterior with
damage confined to the left hemisphere in all but one animal which
displayed negligible contralateral midline ACC injury. All damage was
primarily localized to the dorsal mPFC at the level of the ACC (for representative
injury seeFig. 2a). Half the animals had minor (3) or complete
(2) ablation of the ipsilateral prelimbic subdivision of the mPFC extending
to the dorsal infralimbic region. In one animal injury was anterior
enough to affect the medial orbital cortex. In all animals the infarct
encroached on the dorsal third of M2. The average infarct volume was
20.7 ± 4.68 mm3. Because one animal showed slight injury in the
non-injected hemisphere in study 1 we reduced the rate of ET-1
infusion in study II. The injury profiles were similar between studies I
and II with the exception that there was no incidence of contralateral
damage. ACC infarcts did not impair fine or gross motor control
(p N 0.05) as assessed in the staircase (data not shown) and cylinder
tests (Fig. 2b).

comparisons found that Stroke animals were significantly

Fecal boli
Defecation counts during EPM exposure were significantly affected
by group (p = 0.01). Interestingly, the Stroke–CMS+ SUB animals
defecated significantly more than all other groups, including their
Stroke–CMS+dominant cage mates (Fig. 3c).
Morris water maze
A 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA resulted in a significant
main effect of Surgery (p = 0.03) and Time(pb 0.0001); nomain effect
of SR or CMS (pN 0.05); and a significant interaction of Surgery × Time

revealed that animals with ACC stroke took significantly longer to locate
theplatformon days 1 and 2, pb 0.05,butwere not differentfrom Sham
rats on days 3 and 4 (pN 0.05). By day 3 both surgery treatments had
converged to similar average latencies of ~12 s per trial indicating that
no global deficit in task acquisition resulted from ACC stroke. Analysis
of LTM following a 48 h probe test revealed no significant effect of
Surgery, SR nor CMS (pN 0.05;Fig. 4b).
Qualitative distress scores
Despite no difference in LTM, ACC lesions significantly increased distress
vocalizations duringthewater maze probetrial(pb 0.05; N = 20).
ACC stroke was also found to cause hypersecretion of porphyrin, with
only 1 in 10 sham animals showing hypersecretion versus 6 of 10 stroke
animals (pb 0.05; N = 20).
Neuroendocrine analyses
There were no significant differences in baseline [CORT] (pN 0.05).
A 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Surgery on
adrenal weight and DST ratio (pb 0.05;Fig. 5). Post-hoc comparisons
revealed that ACC stroke caused adrenal hypertrophy and increased
DEX-induced suppression of serum CORT.
Discussion
We sought to determine whether a small prefrontal stroke of the
anterior cingulate region (which is supplied by the ACA), with no
obvious motor impairments, would result in detectable psychosocial
or hormonal changes in male rats. Ourfindings are thefirst to confirm
long-term neurobehavioral consequences produced by a unilateral limbic
cortex stroke that coincides with dysregulation of the HPA axis.
Taken together this study suggests that rats with left ACC stroke exhibit
chronic distress that relates to sustained hyperarousal, adrenal hypertrophy
and an increase in distress vocalizations.
Hyperarousal following ACC stroke is not caused by impaired spatial
mapping
The open-field test revealed stroke-induced hyperactivity at +4,
+8 and +12 wk test points without evidence of habituation during
repeated exposure. Hyperactivity and/or loss of habituation has been
observed across species and models of global ischemia (Sullivan and
Gratton, 1999; O'Malley et al., 2010); chronic stress (Arboix et al.,
2009); as well as following administration of stimulants (Langdon
et al., 2013) and anxiogenic agents (Burn et al., 2006). In the past we
(Sullivan and Gratton, 1999 ) and others (Buccafusco, 1990) have suggested
that open-field post-ischemic hyperactivity may reflect impaired
spatial memory formation, however recent data suggest an alternative
interpretation (O'Malley et al., 2010; Santos and Carlini, 1988; Miller
et al., 1992). Plamondon and colleagues have demonstrated that postischemic
hyperactivity is attenuated by central corticotropin releasing
factor (CRF) receptor 1 antagonism despite persistent spatial deficits
in the radial arm maze (O'Malley et al., 2010). Consistent with these
and other findings (Santos and Carlini, 1988), our data also suggest
that hyperactivity produced by ACC stroke is dissociable from impaired

formation of spatial memories as all groups were able to learn in the
water maze. The ACC stroked animals demonstrated no differences in
the 48 h probe test, suggesting that memory of the spatial map was
preserved.Thepresentopen-fieldhabituation profiles aresimilarto earlier
work using a global ischemia model (Sullivan and Gratton, 1999),
suggesting that ACC stroke and global ischemia may yield similar
behavioral consequences by altering responses to novelty or environmental
stress.
Unilateral ACC stroke affects emotional response to the water maze
A novel finding of this study is that minor stroke altered stress
reaction to the water maze. Despite four days of habituation (32 trials),
rats with ACC stroke exhibited more distress vocalizations than controls
during the probe trial. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was noted
by Sullivan and Gratton (Albert et al., 1986) who reported increased
distress behavior and vocalizations in response to restraint by animals
with left (but not right) hemispheric mPFC lesions. Others have used
“distress calls”as reliable indicators of pain (Han et al., 2005)andemotionality
(Wang and Corbett, 1990; Plamondon and Khan,2006; Norton,
1973) since vocalizations in audible frequencies tend to specifically correspond
to perceived attacks or pain, such as electrical shock (Rodgers
et al., 1995). Moreover, regulation of emotional vocalizations is known
to be functionally related to the ACC (Puurunen and Sivenius, 2002;
Devinsky et al., 1995). This suggests that despite equal proficiency in
theirfinal water maze trial, the animals may have acclimated differently
to the aversely motivated task. Indeed, it was our preliminary observation
of vocalizations and porphyrin secretion among some animals and
not others that prompted us to collect data from the second cohort.
Differences in acclimation to the water maze may account for the
impaired initial performance by stroked rats. Stress impairs attention
and cognitive performance and is an important motivator in aversive
tasks. For example, in one study comparing effects of motivation types
in learning outcomes, rats stressed by lack of experimenter handling
exhibited faster active avoidance but delayed acquisition of a spatial
strategy, yet the same animals were not impaired at an appetitive
spatial task suggesting LTM is functionally intact (Plamondon et al.,
2008). In another study, learning impairments in the Barnes maze induced
by global ischemia were prevented by inhibiting CORT, even
though this intervention did not prevent ischemic hippocampal injury
(Milot and Plamondon, 2011). Thus, ACC stroke may prolong or aggravate
initial task-related stress, temporarily disrupting attention to
problem-solving behavior rather than causing an overt learning blockade
(Plamondon and Khan, 2005). Loss of open-field habituation and
the greater incidence of probe trial distress vocalizations support this
interpretation.
Multiple stressors interact to exacerbate visceral response to novelty
following ACC stroke
Of particular interest was whether a small ACC stroke would augment
susceptibility to stressors. While stroke alone altered behavior in
the open-field and MWM, novelty-induced defecation was highest
due to the 3-way combination of stroke, CMS and social subordination,
suggesting that compound stressors alter visceral sensitivity to novelty.
Subordinate rats with Stroke and CMS defecated more than all other
groups including their dominant cage mates. These results are consistent
with other work which demonstrated that left (but not right)
mPFC lesions affect rats' distress response to restraint (Albert et al.,
1986). Compound stress-induced colonic-hypersensitivity to novelty
is also consistent with studies connecting visceral reactivity to severe,

Left hemispheric ACC stroke alters HPA axis negative feedback
DEX binds Type II glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamic
paraventricularnucleus to dampen endogenous parvicellular CRF secretion
and subsequent adrenal CORT production, but does not penetrate
the blood–brain barrier; hence, the DST can assess negative feedback
of the HPA axis (Biernaskie and Corbett, 2001). Interestingly, lesions of
the left ACC enhanced DEX suppression of the HPA axis — an effect
that, to our knowledge, have not been reported in the rat. Suppression
differences were not due to effects on baseline CORT concentrations,
but appeared to be related to differences in HPA axis activation since
stroke caused stress-induced adrenal hypertrophy. This is consistent
with studies that show chronic ACTH stimulation of the adrenals
resulting from over-activation of the HPA axis relative to controls
(Arboix et al., 2009). Our data are congruent with previous studies
that suggest that an intact right-hemisphere mPFC is required for maximal
HPA axis activation and CORT secretion, whereas the left mPFC is
thought to have a dampening effect (Albert et al., 1986), particularly
the dorsal region which, when lesioned, has been shown to result in
an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress (Devinsky et al., 1995;
Holscher, 1999). It is important to note that in the absence of right
hemisphere controls our suggestion that left ACC stroke selectively
alters HPA axis function remains speculative.
Changes in neuroendocrine regulation are not reflected by EPM behavior
The role of the mPFC and ACC in regulating the neuroendocrine
stress response is well accepted (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009;
Holscher, 1999), whereas behavioral effects have been less commonly
studied. In the present study altered stress-related behavior was
revealed by increased defecation, vocalization, chromodacryorrhea,
and persistent hyperactivity in the open-field. The sensitivity of the
open-field to ACC stroke was particularly interesting given that there
was no difference in the EPM, a classic test of emotionality (Milot and
Plamondon, 2011). However others have encountered similar discrepancies.
In a detailed analysis, Rodgers and colleagues (Burn et al.,
2006) compared the response of mice to four anxiogenic drugs which,
interestingly, showed a bimodal behavioral response in the EPM.
Some drugs produced a typical dose-dependent increase in time spent
in closed arms, while others (e.g. sodium lactate, an effective
panicogenic agent) produced no alteration in arm entry bias compared
to vehicle controls. Consistentwith our interpretations, theauthors conclude
that the EPM is sensitive to certain “types of anxiety”, stating it
may be a good predictor of generalized anxiety but not for panic-like
behavior which may cause a spike in activity, and thus a shift in the
probability of open arm entries. Others also suggest that EPM closed
arm preference is most likely detecting an “inhibitory” anxiety in the
rat (Milot and Plamondon, 2011). These results further reinforce the
need to use multiple behavior measures, as rodent stress or fear
behavior may present in different forms ranging from inhibitory to
panic-like anxiety.
Conclusions: altered psychosocial behavior following ACC stroke
in rats
Our findings mirror emerging clinical reports that small strokes,
even without detectable motor impairment, may be associated with
persistent psychosocial changes (Green and King, 2007; Willey et al.,
2010). In our study we produced a ‘minor’ stroke in the ACC because
of its important role in regulating emotions, motivation, and neuroendocrine
regulation (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009; Sullivan and Gratton,
1999; Pool, 1954). Importantly, ourfindings show that unilateral ACC
stroke in rats results in a sustained disturbance of psychosocial
behavior, altered hormonal feedback and a diminished capacity to
cope with stressors. As such this model may prove to be a useful
means to uncover new treatment modalities for atypical psychosocial
consequences of stroke.
