Abstract Brain plasticity provides a mechanism to
compensate for lesions produced as a result of stroke. The
present study aims to identify new transcription factors
(TFs) following focal cerebral ischaemia in rat as potential
therapeutic targets. A transient focal cerebral ischaemia
model was used for TF-binding activity and TF–TF interaction
profile analysis. A permanent focal cerebral
ischaemia model was used for the transcript gene analysis
and for the protein study. The identification of TF variants,
mRNA analysis, and protein study was performed using
conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), qPCR, and
Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. Rat
cortical neurons were transfected with small interfering
RNA against the TF in order to study its role. The TF-
binding analysis revealed a differential binding activity of
the octamer family in ischaemic brain in comparison with
the control brain samples both in acute and late phases. In
this study, we focused on Oct-2 TF. Five of the six putative
Oct-2 transcript variants are expressed in both control and
ischaemic rat brain, showing a significant increase in the
late phase of ischaemia. Oct-2 protein showed neuronal
localisation both in control and ischaemic rat brain cortical
slices. Functional studies revealed that Oct-2 interacts with
TFs involved in important brain processes (neuronal and
vascular development) and basic cellular functions and that
Oct-2 knockdown promotes neuronal injury. The present
study shows that Oct-2 expression and binding activity
increase in the late phase of cerebral ischaemia and finds
Oct-2 to be involved in reducing ischaemic-mediated
neuronal injury.

Introduction
Ischaemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain
is obstructed. Currently, tissue plasminogen activator
(t-PA) is the only approved treatment for ischaemic stroke.
Unfortunately, t-PA has a limited time window for therapeutic
use, and only 3–5 % of stroke patients arriving at the
hospital qualify for the treatment (Fisher et al. 2009). Thus,
there is a strong need to identify new targets and understand
the molecular mechanisms associated with ischaemic
stroke so that other treatment approaches can be pursued.

It has previously been demonstrated that distinct patterns
of gene expression are seen in tissues from rat and
non-human primate ischaemic (MCAO) stroke models (Xu
et al. 2005; Ford et al. 2006; Rodriguez-Mercado et al.
2012). Microarray analyses from previous studies have
shown that many classes of genes are activated following
ischaemia, but inflammation and cell death are primary
gene categories that appear to be associated with ischaemic
stroke model (Pulliam et al. 2013). Moreover, cerebral
ischaemia also promotes the up-regulation of genes that
aim to remodel cerebral connections and cause structural
and functional changes in all affected structures, including
genes involved in brain plasticity processes (Nadareishvili
and Hallenbeck 2003; Chopp et al. 2007, 2008). In turn, all
these genes can be regulated by transcription factors (TFs)
that bind to regulatory elements in their promoters to
induce or suppress gene expression (Pulliam et al. 2013).
Some examples of these TFs are NF-jB, Hes, HIF-1,
STAT3, AP-1, CREB, Sox2, Pax6, Tcf/Lef, Gli, Olig2,
Dlx2, TLX, and Bmi-1, which have all been reported to
induce neurogenesis following cerebral ischaemia (Zhang
et al. 2011). In the case of HIF-1, this TF has also been
found to trigger cell survival mechanisms (Singh et al.
2012) and CREB has been found to play a critical role in
synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival after ischaemia
(Kitagawa et al. 2012). Previous authors have highlighted
the importance of studying TFs due to the role they play in
preventing damage in cerebral ischaemia (Baranova et al.
2007; Li et al. 2013). These molecules do not act as unique
and direct regulators of gene expression, but most TFs will
dimerise or contribute to large multimetric structures
involved in RNA transcription (Raivich 2011). Although
these factors are involved in plasticity processes, they do
not share a common temporal expression profile after
cerebral ischaemia. However, it is interesting to note the
particular biphasic expression profile of HIF-1 TF, which
functions as a pro-apoptotic and as a tissue repair and prosurvival
factor, in the acute phase (from 1 to 12 h) and late
phase (from 2 to 8 days) of ischaemia, respectively (Baranova
et al. 2007; Singh et al. 2012).
The analysis of transcriptional regulators can be useful
to understand how large sets of genes can be controlled by
a small set of upstream signalling molecules. Moreover, the
knowledge of genes and their transcriptional regulators that
participate in giving the brain the potential to compensate
for ischaemic lesions (plasticity mechanisms) may provide
novel substrates for brain repair and are essential in the
development of optimal stroke therapeutic strategies
(Zhang et al. 2012).
In the present study, with the aim of better understanding
brain plasticity mechanisms and of identifying
new activated TFs involved in cerebral ischaemic response,
a multiplex assay was performed. This assay revealed
important differences in the binding activity of the Octamer
TF family.
Octamer-binding proteins (Oct) are a family of five
cloned and characterised TFs (Oct-1, Oct-2, Oct-3/4, Oct-6,
and Oct-11) that recognise the octamer motif (50-ATGCA
AAT-30). All members belong to the Pit–Oct–Unc (POU)
family of TFs, characterised to contain a POU domain
(with a bipartite structure: specific and homeo-subdomain)
that mediates the DNA binding of these factors, allowing
them to modulate the activity of specific genes with a
critical role in normal development (Kristie and Sharp
1990). In this family, we focused on Oct-2 TF, given the
structural and functional complexity of the different transcript
variants described (Wirth et al. 1991; Lillycrop and
Latchman 1992; Annweiler et al. 1994). Oct-2 was initially
identified in B lymphocytes (Singh et al. 1986; Staudt et al.
1988) but has been found to be widely expressed
throughout the central nervous system during rat embryonic
development. Its expression was restricted to the brain
in adult rats (He et al. 1989). Specifically, the Oct-2 TF has
been reported to be expressed in neuronal cells in the
mammalian developing nervous system (He et al. 1989)
and in rat and mouse neuronal cell lines (Kemp et al. 1990;
Dent et al. 1991; Lillycrop and Latchman 1992; Lillycrop
et al. 1994; Deans et al. 1995; Liu et al. 1995) in control
conditions. Neuronal Oct-2 differs from Oct-2 in B cells
with respect to both sequence specificity and gene activation
ability (Dent et al. 1991). Oct-2 is comprised of an
N-terminal transactivation domain, the characteristic
bipartite DNA-binding domain (Latchman 1996a, b), and a
C-terminal transactivation domain (CTD), indispensable
for in vivo Oct-2 function (Corcoran et al. 2004).
The present study aimed to characterise the Oct-2 TF
following focal cerebral ischaemia in rat by (1) searching
for the predicted transcript variants of the selected TF and
checking their expression in control and ischaemic rat
brain, (2) quantifying their temporal pattern expression at
mRNA and protein levels, (3) determining the TF cellular
localisation in neurons in rat cortex, (4) investigating in
which signalling pathways the TF is involved, and, finally,
(5) testing whether or not the selected TF is involved in
neuronal damage and toxicity.
Results
Ischaemia Modified the Octamer-Binding Activity

TFs involved in cerebral ischaemic response with an
overall beneficial role, as potential therapeutic targets. The

times analysed are represented as MFI values in

binding activity of a single TF or a specific TF family. Of
particular note in this study was the peculiar TF-binding
activity profile of the octamer family. The multiplex analysis

revealed an inhibition of over 70 % of octamer-binding
activity after transient brain ischaemia in comparison with
contralesional tissue brain samples in the acute phase (from
6 to 72 h of reperfusion) (Fig. 2a), with the least binding
activity being recorded at 24 h of reperfusion (a fold
induction of 0.23 in the ipsilesional non-damaged tissue in
comparison with the contralesional tissue, Dev F = 9.81).
At 7 and 14 days, the binding activity was greater
(Fig. 2b), especially at 14 days when ipsilesional core and
peri-infarct tissue samples showed much greater binding
activity than in the contralateral tissue (a fold induction of
1.78 in the ipsilesional core versus the contralesional tissue
, Dev F = 7.56). The specific fold induction values of
the different ischaemic areas versus the corresponding
contralesional tissue when octamer TF-binding activity
differences were significant (changes [ 25 % and Dev
F C2.0) are shown in Supplementary material (Table S1).
These results showed a differential binding activity of the
octamer TF family in the acute and late phases of
ischaemia.

Octamer-2 Transcription Factor Transcripts are
Expressed in Both Control and Ischaemic Rat Brain
In the octamer family, we focused on Octamer-2 (Oct-2) TF
given the structural and functional complexity of the different
transcript variants described (Wirth et al. 1991; Lillycrop and
Latchman 1992; Annweiler et al. 1994). In addition, Oct-2
was the only protein among the different members of this
family that was specifically expressed in the brain with an
expression profile that varied post-ischaemia (data not
shown). In order to characterise Oct-2 in brain ischaemia, we
searched for the predicted transcript variants with the Ensembl
programme and checked its real expression in control and
ischaemic (pMCAO) brain using PCR and specific designed
primers. Ensembl prediction revealed six candidate Oct-2
transcripts for Rattus norvegicus. Conventional PCRs performed
with the specific primers showed that the Oct-2 transcripts
described as ENSRNOT00000048002 (Pou2f2-201)
(269 bp), ENSRNOT00000027649 (Pou2f2-202) (252 bp),
ENSRNOT00000041651 (156 bp), ENSRNOT00000046678
(Pou2f2-203) (509 bp), and ENSRNOT00000068776 (107 bp)
are all expressed in both permanent ischaemic and control
rat brain (Fig. 3a). The transcript described as
ENSRNOT00000027655 (337 bp) was not present in the
control or ischaemic brain, as the only fragment obtained in
this PCR was a band of 470 bp corresponding to the amplification
of the rest of the Oct-2 variants.
Oct-2 mRNA Expression Increases in the Late Phase
of Ischaemia
The different transcript variants identified by conventional
PCR in control and ischaemic conditions were further
analysed by qPCR in order to study their mRNA expression
profile at different times post-ischaemia (Fig. 3b). We
designed specific probes (TaqMan assay) for the five Oct-
2 transcripts identified in rat brain to detect each transcript
by qPCR except for the ENSRNOT00000068776 variant,
which could not be done due to its short sequence. The
present study showed that ischaemia induces changes in
Oct-2 mRNA expression profile. Oct-2 transcript analysis
revealed that ENSRNOT00000048002 (Pou2f2-201)
expression in pMCAO cortex is maintained at basal levels
from 6 to 72 h post-pMCAO. Expression was more than
twice that of the control at 7 days (p\ 0.001) and diminished
at 14 days while still maintaining a higher expression
than the control. This transcript is the most predominant
one in the analysed samples, showing the lowest CT values
(27–28) in the qPCR experiments. ENSRNOT00000027
649 (Pou2f2-202) expression remained lower than in the
control during the acute phase of ischaemia (from 6 to 72 h
post-pMCAO). At 7 days, the expression was significantly
higher than in the control (p\ 0.01), and it diminished
slightly at 14 days while maintaining a higher level of
expression than in the control. ENSRNOT00000041651
expression progressively diminished from 6 to 24 h postischaemia
, increasing progressively at 72 h post-pMCAO
and reaching the maximum expression at 7 days, when it
was 60 % higher than the control (p\ 0.05). Finally, the
ENSRNOT00000046678 (Pou2f2-203) transcript profile
was characterised by progressive increasing between 6 h
and 7 days, when it showed its highest expression at almost
15-fold greater than the control. Statistical analysis indicated
that this increased expression was significant at 72 h
(p\ 0.001), 7 days (p\ 0.001), and 14 days (p\ 0.001)
post-ischaemia (Fig. 3b). This analysis demonstrated that
all Oct-2 transcript variants identified showed a common
mRNA up-regulation 7 days after pMCAO.
Oct-2 Protein Expression Progressively Increases After
Cerebral Ischaemia
In order to analyse the protein expression profile of Oct-2
after cerebral ischaemia, we used two different commercially
available antibodies. One of these antibodies was
able to detect all the transcripts (Fig. 3c) (although only
one band, representing the main transcript 002, was
observed in the membranes), whereas the other is specific
for the 678 transcript variant (Fig. 3d). Octamer-2 protein
(60 kDa) quantified by Western blot showed a progressive
increase, especially from 72 h to 14 days after permanent
ischaemia in comparison with the control, and was
significant at 14 days post-pMCAO (p\ 0.01). The
ENSRNOT00000048002 (Pou2f2-201) isoform (abbreviated
as 002), with a theoretical molecular weight of
59 kDa, was the only Oct-2 transcript detected in the
Western blot shown in Fig. 3c.
The ENSRNOT00000046678 (Pou2f2-203) isoform
(44 kDa), abbreviated as 678 isoform, showed a progressive
increase from 24 h to 14 days post-pMCAO,
which was significant at 14 days post-ischaemia
(p\ 0.05) (Fig. 3d) when the protein expression was
more than tenfold greater than in the control. The other
transcript variants could not be analysed separately by
Western blot as there were no specific antibodies. We
therefore concluded that ischaemia induced an up-regulation
of Oct-2, which reached its maximum expression
14 days after pMCAO.
Oct-2 Protein is Expressed in Neuronal Cells in Rat
Cortical Brain
To further characterise the Oct-2 TF in control and
ischaemic rat brain, we determined the neuronal localisation
of Oct-2 TF in rat cortex. The immunofluorescence
results in rat cortex slices showed Oct-2 protein expression
Neuromol Med (2014) 16:332–349 337
123
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1240730128)
to be localised in NeuN-positive cells both in control and
MCAO conditions (Fig. 4) and that it was slightly
increased in ischaemic conditions. Oct-2 was found to be
expressed both in the nucleus (co-localising with DAPI and
the neuron-specific nuclear protein (Neun) staining) and
the cytoplasm in control and ischaemic conditions, which
was slightly greater in the nucleus of neurons from the
infarct border zone (left of the pMCAO image) in ischaemic
conditions.
Octamer-2 Protein Interacts with Transcription Factors
involved in Neuronal and Vascular Development
and Basic Cellular Functions
In order to elucidate in which signalling pathways Oct-2 is
involved, we analysed the interaction profile of the Oct-2
TF in rat cortical brain slices. The TF–TF array showed
that the Oct-2 protein in control conditions interacts with a
variety of TFs, including ERE, MEF, ETS, MYC-MAX,
OCT-1, NFjB, RXR(DR1), SIE, Smad SBE, and
VDR(DR3). Other TFs including NF-E1, NF-E2, STAT4,
USF-1, HSE, and RAR(DR5) were found with lesser
intensity, meaning that they are weak interactions
(Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, the previously mentioned TF
interactions with Oct-2 changed in transient ischaemic
conditions in comparison with the control tissue sample.
On the one hand, ERE, OCT-1, NFKB, MYC-MAX, and
VDR(DR3) interactions were maintained. On the other
hand, ETS, MEF, NF-E2, NF-E1, RAR(DR5), RXR(DR1),
SIE, Smad SBE, STAT4, USF-1, and HSE interactions
disappeared. In contrast, new TF interactions with NF-1
and SRE were observed, although they were detected as
weak interactions (Fig. 5c). All the different Oct-2 TF
interactions showed in control and ischaemic condition
panels of the array are summarised in Fig. 5d. The Oct-2
TF interactions found are involved in important brain
processes, including neuronal and vascular development,
neuronal survival, and basic cellular functions (growth,
apoptosis, differentiation, and homeostasis). The present
analysis demonstrated that ischaemia induced changes in
the Oct-2 signalling pathways, promoting different TF
interactions in comparison with the Oct-2 profile in control
conditions.
In Vitro Oct-2 Knockdown Promotes Neuronal
Cytotoxicity
Finally, in order to further elucidate the Oct-2 function in
brain, we performed a knockdown study in rat neuronal
culture and analysed the potential role of Oct-2 in neuronal
injury. The treatment of rat cortical neurons in culture with
Oct-2 siRNA, which recognises all Oct-2 transcript variants
, showed a diminution of Oct-2 protein expression at 4
and 5 days post-transfection (a reduction of 30 and 20 %,
respectively) which was significant (p\ 0.01) at the fourth
day (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the Oct-2 siRNA-treated RN
group presented a slight increase in LDH release compared
to the non-target siRNA-treated RN group, from 4 to
Fig. 4 The Oct-2 transcription factor protein is expressed in neuronal
cells in control and ischaemic rat cortical brain. The presence and
localisation of Oct-2 protein in brain cortex slices were analysed by
immunofluorescence using antibodies against: Oct-2 (green), the cell
marker NeuN (red), and DAPI (blue), in control and pMCAO (24 h)
conditions. The images were obtained with a 920 objective and
merged on BD Pathway 855 Bioimager System using BD Attovision
software (original magnification, 9200) (Color figure online)

6 days post-transfection, being significant at 6 days
(p\ 0.05) (Fig. 6b). These experiments showed that RN
cultures with a decreased Oct-2 expression of 30 % or less
correlated with an increase in neuronal toxicity and cell
injury compared with neurons with unaltered Oct-2
expression, in control conditions.
Discussion
In the present study, we found a differential binding
activity of the Oct TFs family after cerebral ischaemia
which led to the performance of an extensive
characterisation of the Oct-2 TF in control and ischaemic
rat brain cortex in order to investigate its putative role in
stroke. A neuronal localisation of the TF was found in
control and ischaemic rat brain and a progressive increase
in mRNA and protein expression in the late phase of
ischaemia. We found that Oct-2 interacts with other TFs
involved in important brain processes including neuronal
and vascular development, neuronal survival, and basic
cellular functions and describe Oct-2 as being involved in
preventing cytotoxicity and neuronal injury in vitro.
Two in vivo models of focal ischaemia have been used
in the present study. tMCAO was selected for the TF-
binding activity and TF–TF interaction array, in which the

in the array, are listed in d. A negative control (normal goat IgG
antibody) was used to elucidate false-positive interactions. Strong
interactions of Oct-2 are shown in black, weak interactions are
indicated in grey (a–c), and new interactions are showed underlined

aim was to identify differences among the different affected
brain zones along the time of post-ischaemia. This
model shows a slow extension of the infarct core into the
penumbra, thus allowing a more prolonged and consistent
peri-infarct area (Hossmann and Traystman 2009). In
contrast, for the study of transcript gene expression and
sub-cellular localisation, a pMCAO was chosen, since in
this model, the core expands into the penumbra much faster
(Hossmann and Traystman 2009) and the infarct volume
shows greater reproducibility.
In order to identify new TFs and elucidate novel regulatory
mechanisms implicated in cerebral ischaemia, a
multiplex TF-binding activity analysis was performed. For
this analysis, we used the Marligen Multiplex Transcription
Factor Profiling Assay, which is compatible with Luminex
xMAP technology, to simultaneously analyse the binding
activity of different TFs in a quantitative and reproducible
format. This technique is faster and easier than EMSAs,
fivefold to tenfold more sensitive than colorimetric ELISAs
, and the multiple binding site analysis mimics in vivo
conditions.
Among the 50 TFs analysed, the octamer family showed
a dramatic change in its binding activity profile during the
acute and late phases after MCAO. Among octamer family,
we focused on Oct-2 TF given that it is the only member of
this family that was specifically expressed in the brain with
an expression profile that varied post-ischaemia and due to
the structural and functional complexity of the different

transcript variants described (Wirth et al. 1991; Lillycrop
and Latchman 1992; Annweiler et al. 1994).
Although Oct-2 expression has also been described in
astrocytes (Schreiber et al. 1990) and in microvascular
endothelial cells (Boutet et al. 2001), we focused the
present study on determining the localisation of the Oct-2
protein in neuronal cells in control and ischaemic rat brain
given that this has been reported by numerous laboratories
as being expressed in the neuronal cells of different
mammal species in control conditions (He et al. 1989;
Scholer et al. 1989; Kemp et al. 1990; Hatzopoulos et al.
1990; Lillycrop et al. 1991; Stoykova et al. 1992). Immunofluorescence
in rat cortical slices revealed a nuclear and
cytoplasm localisation of Oct-2 in neuronal cells, which
was slightly greater in the nucleus in ischaemic conditions
(24 h post-pMCAO). The nuclear increase in Oct-2 was
observed as limited to the infarct border. In contrast, Oct-2
protein up-regulation in the Western blot analysis was
observed in the late phase after ischaemia. These differences
between the two experiments may be due to the fact
that the small differences observed in specific regions of
the cortical slices by immunofluroescence overlapped in
the Western blot analysis, where brain tissue homogenates
were used.
In mouse, it has been described that the primary RNA
transcript of the Oct-2 gene is subject to alternative splicing to
yield different transcripts of the mRNA with distinct effects on
gene expression in B lymphocytes (Oct-2.1 and Oct-2.3 isoforms
) compared to neuronal cells (Oct-2.4 and Oct-2.5 isoforms
). The inclusion (in Oct-2.1) or exclusion (in Oct-2.4 and
Oct-2.5) of the full length CTD and the presence of a negative
regulatory domain (NRD) (in Oct-2.3) in the Oct-2 protein
determine the transcriptional function and its transactivation
potential (Latchman 1996a). Thus, the identification and
individual analysis of the different Oct-2 transcript variants in
rat brain were essential in order to avoid misinterpretations
whether due to analysis of all the transcripts together or the
study of a specific reference variant. This study showed that
five of the six predicted rat variants are expressed in control as
well as in ischaemic rat cortex. According to Ensembl
sequences and the nomenclature previously used for Oct-2
mouse transcripts (Wirth et al. 1991), rat transcripts should
correspond to Oct-2.5 (ENSRNOT00000048002 or Pou2f2-201),
Oct-2.3 (ENSRNOT00000027649 or Pou2f2-202), and
Oct-2.6 (ENSRNOT00000046678 or Pou2f2-203). The
ENSRNOT00000041651 and the ENSRNOT00000068776
did not match any of the transcripts previously described in
mice, although ENSRNOT00000041651 showed a certain
structural similarity with the Oct-2.3 (the NRD motif) and
the Oct-2.5 transcript (a truncated C-terminus domain). All
the transcripts analysed contained the DNA-binding
motif necessary for the TF function with the exception of
ENSRNOT00000068776. This transcript variant was found
to consist only of the minimum structure (the specific POU
and homeo-subdomains) for it to bind to its target sequence,
without the presence of any transactivation domain.
According to previous studies in mouse (Annweiler et al.
1994; Corcoran et al. 2004), the ENSRNOT00000046678
(Oct-2.6) and ENSRNOT00000027649 (Oct-2.3) transcripts
identified in rat brain samples could have an activating
transcriptional activity, as they present the full C-terminus
activation domain. In this domain, the nine amino acids
shown to be critical for the CTD function can be identified
(Fig. S5). On the other hand, the ENSRNOT00000048002
(Oct-2.5) and ENSRNOT00000041651 transcripts that lack
the full CTD domain containing the nine critical amino acids
might perform an inhibitory transcriptional activity.
The results of the different experiments performed were
found to agree with each other: (a) the mRNA expression
profiles of the analysed Oct-2 transcripts tended to be similar
, increasing progressively in the late phase of ischaemia
(around 7 days); (b) the Oct-2 protein was shown to increase
at 14 days post-pMCAO; and (c) the Oct-2 TF-binding
activity induction (versus the control) was observed at
14 days after ischaemia. In addition, the mRNA and protein
expression patterns followed a concordant profile, showing
an mRNA increase 7 days after pMCAO which could lead to
a peak in protein expression observed at 14 days after
ischaemia. The ENSRNOT00000046678 (Pou2f2-203)
transcript particularly stands out as it shows a huge increase
in its expression at 7 days post-pMCAO. However, the
ENSRNOT00000048002 (Pou2f2-201) transcript variant is
found to be the predominant variant in the samples studied
here.
With regards to the function of Oct-2, it has been suggested
that it may play a critical role in the normal
development of the central nervous system of mammals
(Latchman 1996a) and, particularly, for post-natal survival
(Phillips and Luisi 2000; Corcoran et al. 2004). In order to
better understand this function, a TF–TF interaction array
was performed. This analysis showed that Oct-2 interacts
with several TFs which principally modulate neuronal and
vascular development processes and basic cellular functions
(surveillance, apoptosis, growth, differentiation, and
homeostasis). Specifically, the present study showed that
Oct-2 could participate in the regulation of the angiogenesis
and vascular development (through ETS interaction)
(Lelievre et al. 2001; Sato et al. 2001); the survival of
newly differentiated neurons and the cardiovascular
development (through MEF) (Ikeshima et al. 1995; Naya
et al. 1999; Agarwal et al. 2011); neuronal cell death and
inflammation (through NFjB) (Qin et al. 1998; Crack and
Taylor 2005); cellular proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis (through Myc-Max) (Chen et al. 1995; Tencheva
and Panov 2008); and growth, differentiation, development
, and homeostasis processes [through ERE (Lee and
Neuromol Med (2014) 16:332–349 341

Mouradian 1999) and RXR(DR1) (Collino et al. 2008;
Giaginis et al. 2011; Mathisen et al. 2011)]. These results
agree with earlier studies in humans (Andersen and Rosenfeld 2001) in which some of the previous Oct-2 interactions
with other DNA-binding proteins, such as MEF,
NF1, and nuclear hormone receptors (RXR and VDR), are
described. In addition, as previously reported (Andersen
and Rosenfeld 2001), we can conclude that Oct-2 can
heterodimerise with other factors as the interaction with the
Oct-1 TF observed in the present study demonstrates.
Moreover, the present study has shown that ischaemia
induced changes in the Oct-2 interaction profile, promoting
new as well as the disappearance of some interactions.
However, this does not imply a decrease in Oct-2 transcription
activity. The cooperative assembly among different
TFs may act as a repressor (not allowing the TF to
bind to its target sequences) or as a promoter (acting as a
co-activator), which is necessary for target promoter
binding (Martinez 2002). Therefore, depending on the
function of these interactions in the Oct-2 interaction profile
, disruption may lead to inhibition or activation of the
different target promoter sequences. Further investigations
will be required to elucidate the role of these specific multiprotein
interactions.
Finally, in order to investigate the Oct-2 potential
function in the brain, we performed knockdown experiments
with rat cortical neurons in culture to test its possible
involvement in neuronal survival and damage, as it seems
to point the results from the TF–TF interaction array. The
culture was treated with Oct-2 siRNA, and the neuronal
cytotoxicity was analysed by LDH release measurement
over time post-siRNA transfection. These experiments
showed a correlation between Oct-2 knockdown and an
increase in the LDH leakage from rat cortical neuron culture.
Previous studies have shown that the efflux of LDH
occurring from either necrotic or apoptotic neurons is
proportional to the number of damaged or destroyed cells
(Koh and Choi 1987; Gwag et al. 1995), being a parameter
of cellular injury (Arce et al. 2012; Thoresen et al. 2012).
Our results show that a reduction in Oct-2 expression in
neuronal cells leads to a slight increase in neuronal injury
in vitro, suggesting that Oct-2 seems to be involved in
preventing neuronal cytotoxicity. We have observed a
trend of increasing neuronal damage in Oct-2 siRNA-
treated neurons from 4 to 6 days after transfection, showing
non-markedly differences compared with the control
neurons. Surely, this slight increase, we observed, is proportional
to the percentage of Oct-2 protein knockdown
obtained, which was of 20–30 % compared to the control.
Some previous studies have already showed the Oct-2 TF
role in promoting neuronal surveillance. It has been
described that Oct-2 is being up-regulated 3–4 times by
NGF (neuronal growth factor) in sensory rat neurons, thus
suggesting that Oct-2 plays a role in mediating the transcriptional
effects (promotion of neuronal survival and
preventing neuronal death) induced by this growth factor
(Wood et al. 1992; Kim et al. 2004). Moreover, it has also
been reported that Oct-2 TF is involved in the regulation of
genes encoding different synaptic proteins (SNAP-25 and
synapsin I) in neuronal cells (Deans et al. 1997). In the
present study, we have found that the inhibitory Pou2f2-
201 isoform is the predominant one in the rat ischaemic
brain, so we hypothesise that this variant could prevent
neuronal injury directly inhibiting cellular death signalling
pathways as described for Oct-4 and miR-125b/BAK1
pathway (Wang et al. 2013). On the other hand, we have
also demonstrated that the transcripts variants Pou2f2-202
and Pou2f2-203 that are characterised for an activating
transcriptional activity are up-regulated by ischaemia.
These transcript variants could reduce neuronal injury by
promoting pro-survival signalling pathways (by directly
regulating bcl-2 expression) (Heckman et al. 2006). Thus,
the present study is the first one to demonstrate the Oct-2
potential to prevent neuronal toxicity. Further experiments
are necessary to fully understand how the TF perform this
role: directly (inhibiting neuronal cell death or activating
the neuronal pro-survival signalling pathways) or through
the interaction with other TFs (found in the TF–TF array)
involved in the activation of homeostasis processes which
promote the restoration of neuronal functions.
Therefore, the results from the present functional studies
(TF–TF interaction array and knockdown studies) suggest
that Oct-2 is involved in counteracting the mechanisms that
cause neuronal injury, which could lessen the infarct progression
in the late phase when the maximum expression is
observed. Hence, it seems likely that the up-regulation of
Oct-2 TF could play a role in functional pathophysiological
recuperation after ischaemia. In the acute phase, the
induction of Oct-2 TF expression may be effective in
reducing the ischaemic-mediated neuronal death and so
could be an effective brain protector therapy to be used in
the first hours after stroke.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which
the octamer family, specifically the Oct-2 TF, has been
studied in cerebral ischaemia. Here, we show that differences
in Oct-2 binding activity and gene expression are
observed in the acute and late phase of ischaemia. We also
describe Oct-2 neuronal localisation and its interactions
with other TFs in control and ischaemic rat brain. Finally,
our findings provide evidence for Oct-2-mediated responses
having an overall beneficial role in neuronal physiological

functions, suggesting that it could be involved in reducing
neuronal injury in the context of cerebral ischaemia. Further
studies are necessary to validate the role of Oct-2 in stroke
and determine whether Oct-2 TF promotes these effects
directly or indirectly, forming a multi-protein complex
through interaction with other TFs.
Materials and Methods
All procedures were approved by the Committee of Animal
Care of the Universidad Complutense of Madrid in
accordance with European Union regulations (86/609/
CEE) and Spanish legislation (RD223/88).
Bioinformatics
Octamer-2 rat transcript variant identification was performed
using Ensembl gene predictions and related
sequences of Entrez Gen at the NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information). Ensembl release 69—October
2012, and Ensembl release 70—January 2013, were used
(Hubbard et al. 2009, b). While the present manuscript was
being prepared, the Ensembl database was updated with the
result that Ensemble release 69 became Ensembl release 70
and that the original six transcript variants became only
three (Pou2f2-201, Pou2f2-202, and Pou2f2-203) for the
rat Oct-2 gene. Therefore, in the present study, all of the
original six transcript variants were considered in characterising
Oct-2 in ischaemic rat brain. Homology between
transcript sequences was determined using Clustalw2.
Sequence data were also aligned using this software
(Chenna et al. 2003). The theoretical molecular weights of
the different Oct-2 isoforms were obtained using the
Compute pI/Mw tool of the Expert Protein Analysis System
(ExPASy) on the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics
website (2006). Primer3 software was used for PCR primer
design (2009c), and 7,000 System software v1.2.3 (Applied
Biosystems) was used to perform qPCR and to further
analyse the data obtained.
In Vivo Cerebral Ischaemia Models
Experiments were performed on adult male Fischer rats
(250–300 g body weight; Harlan). Animals were housed
individually under standard conditions of temperature and
humidity and with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at
08:00) with free access to food and water. Rats were
anaesthetised with isoflurane 1.5–2 % with a mixture of
70 % nitrogen and 30 % oxygen. Body temperature was
maintained at physiological levels with a heating pad
during the surgical procedure and anaesthesia recovery.
Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats
The transitory cerebral ischaemia model was performed
according to a previously reported 3-vessel occlusion
model (Chen et al. 1986; Liu et al. 1989; Sobrado et al.
2003). After 90 min of distal occlusion of the left MCA
and both common carotid arteries (CCA), the three arteries
were opened and complete reperfusion was observed under
an operating microscope. Transient MCAO rats were killed
at 6, 24, and 72 h and 7 and 14 days after reperfusion
(n = 3 rats in each group). Brains were removed, and
cortical ipsilesional core, ipsilesional peri-infarct, and ipsilesional
non-damaged tissue, as well as contralesional
cortex tissue [as shown in Fig. 7, adapted from (Sobrado
et al. 2011)], were collected at each period of time. The
ischaemic core was defined as the cortical tissue surrounding
the occluded MCA, which differed from adjacent
tissue consistency and according to Sobrado et al. (2011).
The peri-infarct tissue was identified as the cortical tissue
immediately adjacent to the core and based on the average
images (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC; and cerebral
blood flow, CBF) according to Sobrado et al. (2011).
Samples were immediately frozen at -80 C until
nuclear extract isolation. Contralesional tissue was used as
a control to conduct the TF-binding activity assay.
Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Rats
The permanent cerebral ischaemia model was induced
following a previously described method (Hurtado et al.
Fig. 7 Scheme of the sample collection after rat tMCAO. The brain
was sliced in coronal sections corresponding to the territory of the
MCA. The cortical ipsilesional tissue was identified by the different
consistency of the tissue, and for the rest of the regions, we proceeded
as shown in the picture [adapted from (Sobrado et al. 2011)]

2005; Mallolas et al. 2006). Briefly, permanent focal
cerebral ischaemia was induced by ligature of the left
common carotid artery and occlusion of the ipsilateral
distal MCA. Brains were removed, and cortical infarcted
and peri-infarcted tissue were collected from the pMCAO
animals at 6, 24, and 72 h and 7 and 14 days after occlusion
(n = 6 rats in each group). Samples were divided into
two and frozen at -80 C until RNA, and protein isolation
were undertaken.
Likewise, control samples from healthy animals were
also collected following the same protocol in order to
perform the gene expression analysis, the protein study,
and the TF–TF interaction array.
Transcription Factor Binding Activity Assay
A Luminex bead-based system was used to simultaneously
assess the binding activity of 50 different TFs (Table S2) in
nuclear extracts from rat brain after tMCAO. The nuclear
extracts were obtained from control and transient ischaemic
rat brain samples using a Nuclear Extraction kit
(Marligen Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer
’s instructions. TFs were analysed with a Luminex
200TM instrument using Marligen Multiplex Transcription
Factor Profiling Assay (Marligen Biosciences) and Star-
StationTM software for data acquisition. This assay is based
on the specific binding of TFs to cognate DNA sequences
on labelled beads (polystyrene microspheres internally
dyed with fluorophores) (xMAP technology). The
sequences are mined from protein binding sequences in the
TRANSFAC database (http://www.gene-regulation.com/
pub/databases.html). Within the analyser, lasers excite the
internal dyes that identify each microsphere particle and
also capture any reporter dye during the assay. In this way,
the technology allows multiplexing of up to 100 unique
assays within a single sample. The assay is more sensitive
than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or gel
shift assay (Shurin et al. 2005; Hansmann et al. 2008). The
ipsilesional core, the ipsilesional peri-infarct, and the ipsilesional
non-damaged tissue, as well as the contralesional
cortex tissue from each rat brain, were analysed separately
following the manufacturer’s recommendations. About
10 lg of nuclear extracts was used to perform the activation
profile analysis of the 50 TFs. Positive and negative
(background) controls and HL-60 cells treated and
untreated with PMA/lonomycin for 24 h were used as the
assay control and nuclear extract control, respectively.
The binding activity was measured in mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. In order to quantitatively measure the magnitude
of the changes, an algorithm based on least median
squares (LMS to estimate the slope and intercept of the line
that best fits the collinear points) was used. The
significance of change was represented by Dev F, which is
the ratio of the difference between the MFI of the treated
sample and the expected value to the sum of the standard
deviations of the treated and untreated sample. A Dev
F value of two or greater is considered significant. MFI
values in control and ischaemic samples are compared in a
scatter plot graph (Fig. 1). Each point in Fig. 1 represents a
single TF. Data points on the scatter plot that are co-linear
or nearly co-linear represent TFs with unchanged binding
activity. Data points that are significantly distant from the
co-linear points represent TFs that have changed their
binding activity due to the treatment, which in this case is
the induced ischaemia (tMCAO).
Oct-2 Expression Study in Rat Brain
RNA Extraction, Quantification, and Retrotranscription
RNA extraction was undertaken from rat brain tissue
submitted to pMCAO. Qiazol lysis reagent (Qiagen) was
immediately transferred to frozen samples of cerebral
cortex and then homogenised using an Ultra-Turrax T25
homogeniser. The protocol for the use of the RNeasy
Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) for RNA quantification
and purity estimation (GeneQuant, Biochrom) and
reverse transcription (High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems) was followed as
previously described (Gubern et al. 2009). Two independent
retrotranscription reactions were performed for
all samples.
Identification of Oct-2 Transcript Variants
Rat Oct-2 transcript variants were predicted using Ensembl
software (Hubbard et al. 2009; 2009b). The identification of
the Oct-2 transcripts in control and ischaemic cortex was
performed by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using retrotranscribed cDNA and a pair of primers specifically
designed, except in the case of ENSRNOT00000027655, to
amplify each transcript variant separately (Table S3). In the
case of ENSRNOT00000027655, amplification was undertaken
by designing a pair of oligonucleotides that amplify both
this specific transcript and the rest of the transcript variants.
Analysis of Oct-2 Transcripts Expression in Rat Cortex
Gene expression analysis of Oct-2 transcripts in each
sample (control and permanent ischaemic samples) was
conducted using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (with
the 2-DDCT method). Specific TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays were designed to study the individual transcripts.
To correctly perform ENSRNOT00000046678 (Pou2f2-
203) transcript variant quantification, it was necessary to
344 Neuromol Med (2014) 16:332–349

( 8.0.0.2542.514814729 PDF Extractor SDK EVALUATION)
preamplify all samples for this transcript and the reference
genes using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The assay design was performed
with the Custom TaqMan Assay Design Tool on
the Applied Biosystems website (2009a). The gene
expression conditions have been previously described
(Gubern et al. 2009). Reactions were run in an ABI PRISM
7000 Instrument (Applied Biosystems), and TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix was used. Ywhaz and Sdha
were used as reference genes for expression data normalisation
as has been previously described (Gubern et al.
2009).
Protein Extraction and Quantification
Frozen cerebral cortex samples from permanent ischaemia
were homogenised by sonication during 10–12 s and
using a homogenisation buffer containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail (serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases)
and 0.1 % Nonidet P40 (Roche). Rat cortical neuronal
culture (RN) samples (transfected Oct-2 and non-target
siRNA) were homogenised using a lysis buffer (Cell
Signalling) with PMSF (1 %), mixed with vortex every
5 min for 30 min while maintained in ice. Cortex and RN
homogenised samples were then centrifuged, and the
supernatant (protein) was collected. Protein quantification
was performed using a Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) based
on the Bradford method in accordance with the manufacturer
’s instructions.
Western Blot
Brain tissue homogenates from control and permanent
ischaemic (pMCAO) rats containing 60 lg of protein and
lysates from siRNA transfected RN containing 10 lg of 
protein were loaded, and the proteins were size-separated
in 10 % SDS-PAGE (90 mA) (Romera et al. 2004;
Mallolas et al. 2006). The proteins were blotted onto a
PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) and incubated with the
specific primary antibody against Oct-2 (sc-25400; 1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which binds to 360-479
amino acids of Oct-2 so as to recognise all the different
transcript variants. Another primary antibody against Oct-
2 was used (sc-233; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
which only recognises one of the transcript variants
(ENSRNOT00000046678). Proteins recognised by the
antibodies were revealed with SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) used in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. b-actin
was used as the loading control. Specific signals were
quantified with densitometry analysis software (Kodak MI
5.0 SE version).
Immunofluorescence
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats (n = 2 for each
group) were anaesthetised, fixed, and cryopreserved as
previously reported (Sobrado et al. 2009). Brains were
frozen and serials of 40-lm-thick coronal sections were cut
with a sliding microtome (Leica SM200R) and mounted on
glass slides. Adjacent sections were then processed to
perform immunohistochemistry. Primary antibodies rabbit
polyclonal anti-Oct-2 (1:50; Sta Cruz Biotechnology, sc-
25400) and the respective cell marker mouse monoclonal
anti-NeuN (1:100; Chemicon, MAB377) were used. Secondary
antibody staining using Alexa Fluor 488/594 goat
anti-rabbit/mouse IgGs (Invitrogen) and counterstaining
using DAPI (Invitrogen) were performed following BD
Biosciences protocols. Images were captured by different
channels for Alexa Fluor 488 (pseudo-coloured green),
Alexa Fluor 594 (pseudo-coloured red), and DAPI (pseudocoloured
blue) on a BD PathwayTM 855 Bioimager System
(Becton–Dickinson Biosciences) with 920 objective (NA
075 Olympus). The z-stack application was used to obtain
the images using BD AttovisionTM software. Both acquisition
and merging of images were carried out according to
the recommended assay procedure using BDAttovisionTM
software.
Oct-2 Interaction Analysis in Rat Brain
In order to assess the interactions of Oct-2 and determine
the cellular processes it is involved in, a TranSignalTM TF–
TF Array Kit version I (Panomics) was used in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. This kit consists of a
ChIP-Array method based on a combination of the chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and a high-throughput
technique (array). These two coupled techniques allow the
active transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) of a specific
TF to be mapped efficiently. Moreover, combining
array profiling and ChIP data permits a more effective
TFBS analysis for the study of the function of a TF (Qin
et al. 2011).
About 30 lg of nuclear extracts was incubated with a
cocktail of biotin-labelled double-strand DNA oligonucleotide
probes (known TF-binding consensus sequences).
About 2 lg of Oct-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
was used to immunoprecipitate Oct-2-associated TFs and
their corresponding cis-elements. A control antibody
(normal IgG; Santa Cruz Biothecnology) was used as a
negative control. Different washing steps were then performed
to eliminate free cis-elements and non-specific
binding proteins. Finally, the bounded cis-elements were
eluted and hybridised to the TranSignalTM Protein/DNA
Array membranes, spotted with 54 different consensus
DNA sequences, which are complementary to the known
Neuromol Med (2014) 16:332–349 345
123
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-163442838)
TF target sequences, TFBS. The symbols and complete
names of the TFs which were studied are shown in Table
S4 (supplementary information). The membranes were
revealed with the detection compounds from the kit, which
was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
This array is a qualitative assay in which the spots
indicate the presence or absence of the TF interaction.
Therefore, the signal intensity of the array spots is not
proportional to the amount of interaction, but rather is
proportional to the quality of these interactions (strong or
weak).
Treatment of Cortical Neurons with Oct-2 siRNA
In order to study and elucidate the role of Oct-2 in
cerebral ischaemia, pure rat cortical neuronal cultures
(RN) were prepared as previously described (Romera
et al. 2004) for use in gene knockdown experiments. Cells
were seeded (1.5 9 106 per well) in six-well plates
(Cultek) previously coated with poly-lysine (Sigma), and
the Oct-2 siRNA transfection was performed at
10–12 days in vitro (DIV). The RN cells were transfected
with a mixture containing basal medium, 16.7 ll/well
HiperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen), and 50 nM/
well of ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool Oct-2 siRNA (a
mixture of four Oct-2 siRNAs) (Dharmacon) or 50 nM/
well of non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon) as the negative
control of siRNA transfection. Twenty hours after siRNA
transfection, the medium was replaced by complete RN
growth medium. For this study, we used non-target siRNA-treated
RN culture as control group, as in the optimisation
study, the different control groups tested (nontreated
cells, transfection reactive only treated cells
(mock), and non-target siRNA-treated cells) showed no
significant differences (p[ 0.05) in viability and cytotoxicity.
From 4 to 6 days after transfection, culture
cytotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay (Fig. 6b). As a marker of cell injury
(necrotic damage), LDH release from damaged cells was
determined using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive
Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) and measured spectrophotometrically
at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan).
LDH was measured in at least three different wells per
experiment. The results were normalised to the mean
maximal LDH value, corresponding to cells exposed to 0,
1 % Triton X-100, which causes near complete neuronal
cell death (100 %). The results are expressed as a percentage
of the maximal LDH level and represented in
comparison with the negative control group (Lobner
2000; Pan et al. 2012; Xie et al. 2012). At 4 and 5 days
post-transfection, the cells were collected and frozen at
-80 C until protein isolation was undertaken (Fig. 6a).
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test (or the Kruskal–Wallis test when data were not normally
distributed) was conducted, followed by Dunnett’s
post hoc analysis (or the Mann–Whitney test when data
were not normally distributed) to compare each of the time
points analysed post-pMCAO with the control group mean.
Comparison between groups of the siRNA transfection
experiment was made by the Student’s unpaired t test. A
p value \ 0.05 was considered statistically significant
(* p\ 0.05, ** p\ 0.01, # p\ 0.001). Statistical analysis
was performed using the 11.5.0 version of SPSS software
(SPSS Inc).
