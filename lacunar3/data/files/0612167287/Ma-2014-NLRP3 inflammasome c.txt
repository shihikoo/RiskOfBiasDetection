Hemorrhage

Objective: The NLRP3 (NALP3, cryopyrin) inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, facilitates
caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)21b processing, which amplifies the inflammatory response. Here, we investigated
whether NLRP3 knockdown decreases neutrophil infiltration, reduces brain edema, and improves neurological function
in an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mouse model. We also determined whether mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) governed by mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) would trigger NLRP3 inflammasome
activation following ICH.
Methods: ICH was induced by injecting autologous arterial blood (30ll) into a mouse brain. NLRP3 small interfering
RNAs were administered 24 hours before ICH. A mPTP inhibitor (TRO-19622) or a specific mitochondria ROS scavenger
(Mito-TEMPO) was coinjected with the blood. In naive animals, rotenone, which is a respiration chain complex
I inhibitor, was applied to induce mitochondrial ROS production, and followed by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO treatment.
Neurological deficits, brain edema, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, in vivo chemical crosslinking
, ROS assay, and immunofluorescence were evaluated.
Results: ICH activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 knockdown reduced brain edema and decreased myeloperoxidase
(MPO) levels at 24 hours, and improved neurological functions from 24 to 72 hours following ICH. TRO-
19622 or Mito-TEMPO reduced ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and MPO levels following ICH. In naive animals
, rotenone administration induced mPTP formation, ROS generation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which
were then reduced by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO.
Interpretation: The NLRP3 inflammasome amplified the inflammatory response by releasing IL-1b and promoting
neutrophil infiltration following ICH. Mitochondria ROS may be a major trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
The results of our study suggest that the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome may effectively reduce the inflammatory
response following ICH.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating
disease, accounting for 15 to 20% of all
stroke types.1 There is currently no effective treatment
for ICH.2,3 Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation
mechanisms play a critical role in the pathophysiology
of ICH.4 After ICH, blood components, including
blood-borne leukocytes, enter into the brain parenchyma
and activate resident immune cells, such as microglia.
Leukocyte infiltration and activation of microglia
enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
Among all the cytokines, interleukin (IL)21b is regarded
as a pivotal therapeutic target in ICH,5 as the observations
demonstrated that the overexpression of the IL-1b
antagonist via an adenovirus vector reduced brain edema
and thrombin-induced inflammation in the ICH rat
model.6 Our previous work has shown that the

inhibition of caspase-1, the converting enzyme of active
IL-1b, reduced ICH induced brain injury.7 However,
how IL-1b is processed following ICH remains unclear.
Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested
that inflammasome, one of the components of the
innate immune system, is involved in the pathogenesis
of sterile inflammatory response by processing caspase-1
and IL-1b to an active stage following human central
nervous system (CNS) disorders (such as spinal cord
injury,8 traumatic brain injury,9 and ischemic stroke10).
Among 20 members of the human NLR protein family
that have been reported, the NLRP3 (NALP3, cryopyrin
) inflammasome gains notable attention, as it can
sense multiple stimulus, including tissue injury and
microbial invasion.11 The NLRP3 inflammasome contains
NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3),
which is associated with the apoptosis-associated specklike
protein containing a caspase recruitment domain
(ASC), which recruits and activates caspase-1, therefore
releasing cleaved IL-1b.12,13
In the present study, we investigated the role of the
NLRP3 inflammasome in ICH-induced inflammation,
especially the mechanism of its activation. We hypothesized
that the NLRP3 inflammasome may respond to
ICH injury, and enhance inflammatory response by facilitating
caspase-1 activation and IL-1b processing.
NLRP3 activation after ICH may be triggered by mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species ROS (mROS), which
are regulated by mitochondrial permeability transition
pores (mPTPs; Supplementary Fig 2). To test this
hypothesis, we first investigated the expression profiles of
the NLRP3 inflammasome components, including
NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1b, after ICH. Next, we
applied small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down
NLRP3 in vivo, and measured the NLRP3 component
alterations as well as the functional outcomes. Additionally
, specific mitochondrial ROS scavenger (Mito-
TEMPO), or mPTP inhibitor (TRO-19622) was administered
following ICH. In naive animals, a respiration
chain complex I inhibitor, rotenone, was introduced into
the brain followed by a mROS scavenger or mPTP
inhibitor to determine the role of mPTP on the regulation
of ROS in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All procedures for this study were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee at Loma Linda University.
Eight-week-old male CD1 mice (weight530g, Charles River,
Wilmington, MA) were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle at
a controlled temperature and humidity with free access to food
and water.
ICH Mouse Model
The general procedures for inducing ICH in the mouse using
autologous arterial blood injection into the basal ganglia were
performed as described in previous publications.14,15 The
details are also described in the Supplementary Text and Supplementary
Figure 1A..
Experimental Design
Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted in autologous arterial
blood injection models, and experiment 3 was conducted in
naive animals.
EXPERIMENT 1. The NLRP3 siRNAs mixture was administered
intraventricularly (100pmol in 2ll) 24 hours before ICH.
Vehicle animals were given the same volume injection, but with
scramble siRNA (siCtrl). Samples for Western blot, enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunostaining
were collected 12 hours after ICH. Neurological deficits and
brain edema were measured at 24 and 72 hours.
EXPERIMENT 2. TRO-19622 (mPTP inhibitor, 2lg/2ll
per mouse)16,17 or Mito-TEMPO (mitochondrial specific ROS
scavenger, 20lg/2ll per mouse)16 was simultaneously injected
with autologous blood into the right basal ganglia. Vehicle
groups received the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline
injection. Some animals were injected with disuccinimidyl
suberate (DSS)16 at a concentration of 5mM by intracerebroventricular
(ICV) injection in the contralateral hemisphere 11
hours following ICH (for details see in vivo chemical crosslinking
assay). Samples for Western blot, ELISA, ROS assay,
and immunostaining were collected 12 hours after ICH.
EXPERIMENT 3. Rotenone (mitochondrial complex I inhibitor
, 0.4lg/2ll per mouse)18 was administered into the right
basal ganglia of naive animals. In some animals, TRO-19622
(mPTP inhibitor, 2lg/2ll per mouse) or Mito-TEMPO
(mROS scavenger, 20lg/2ll per mouse) was simultaneously
injected with rotenone into the right basal ganglia. In vivo DSS
chemical cross-linking experiments were also conducted. Samples
for Western blot, ELISA, and ROS assay were collected at
1 hour or 4 hours following injection.
NLRP3 siRNA Injection
Two different formats of NLRP3 siRNA were applied, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, to enhance the silencing
effect. For more details see Supplementary Text.
Hematoma Volume
Hematoma volume was analyzed by hemoglobin assay 24 hours
after ICH operation. For more details see Supplementary Text.
Neurobehavioral Function Test
Neurobehavioral functions were evaluated by the modified Garcia
test for the sensorimotor deficits as previously described.19
Four items, including side stroke, vibrissae touch, limb symmetry
, and lateral turning, were tested with a maximum neurological
score of 12, which represented healthy animals. The
neurobehavioral function test was conducted at different time

the study.
Western Blotting
The primary antibodies included anti-NLRP3 (1:1,000; Adipo-
Gen, San Diego, CA), anti–caspase-1 p20 (1:1,000; Millipore,
Billerica, MA), anti-MPO (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), anti-VDAC (1:1,000; Millipore), and anti-
CypD (1:1,000; Millipore). For more details see Supplementary
Text.
ELISA Assay
Brain samples were collected at the indicated times and assayed
with a Mouse IL-1b/IL-1F2 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems
, Minneapolis, MN).
ROS Assay
Brain samples were collected at the indicated times. Total ROS
in brains were measured with the Oxiselect in vitro ROS/RNS
assay kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer
’s instructions. Fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein was
measured using a microplate reader and normalized to sham
animals.
Immunofluorescence
The details are described in the Supplementary Text.
In Vivo Chemical Cross-Linking Assay
The formation of mPTP was detected by chemical cross-linking
in vivo as described in previous studies.16 DSS (Pierce, Rockford
, IL) at a concentration of 5mM was administered using
ICV injection in the contralateral hemisphere 11 hours following
ICH. Mice remained alive for 1 hour after DSS injection
and were then sacrificed by decapitation. The brain from each
mouse was removed quickly from the cranium and placed in an
ice-cold Hanks buffer. Samples were rinsed briefly in ice-cold
50mM Tris-glycine buffer, then lysed, homogenized, and evaluated
for voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) oligomerization
by Western blotting.
Statistics
Data were expressed as the mean6standard error of the mean.
Analysis was performed using GraphPad (La Jolla, CA) Prism
software. The details are described in the Supplementary Text.
Results
NLRP3, Cleaved Caspase-1, and IL-1b Were
Upregulated following ICH Injury
We first investigated whether the NLRP3 inflammasome
components would respond to brain injury following
blood injection. Western blot results showed that NLRP3
levels were significantly increased at 3 hours, and reached
a peak at around 12 hours after ICH, whereas NLRP3
levels were about 33 those of the sham group (p<0.05;
Fig 1). Accordingly, cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1b, the
products of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, were significantly
increased at 3 hours (p<0.05) after ICH and
peaked at 12 hours. Following this peak, NLRP3, cleaved
caspase-1, and IL-1b levels declined, but still remained at
high levels at 72 hours when compared with sham animals.
Double immunostaining showed that NLRP3 is
mainly expressed in microglia cells and not in other cell
types, such as astrocytes (data not shown).
NLRP3 siRNA Injection Knocked Down NLRP3
Level as Well as Cleaved Caspase-1 and IL-1b
following ICH Injury
To investigate the potential role of the NLRP3 inflammasome
in ICH-induced brain injury, 2 siRNAs were mixed
and administered by ICV injection 24 hours before ICH
surgery. After 12 hours, Western blot results showed that
NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 levels were significantly
reduced by NLRP3 siRNA injection when compared to
ICH without treatment and scramble siRNA
(ICH1siCtrl) injection animals (p<0.05; Fig 2).
Accordingly, IL-1b levels detected by ELISA were also
markedly reduced compared to ICH without treatment
and siCtrl animals (p<0.05). At 24 hours, hematoma
volume was detected by hemoglobin assay, and there were
no differences between the ICH group and the NLRP3
siRNA injection group (see Supplementary Fig 1B).
NLRP3 Knockdown Improved Neurobehavioral
Functions, Reduced Brain Edema, and
Neutrophil Infiltration
The results at 24 and 72 hours showed that ICH animals
demonstrated severe deficits compared to sham animals in
the modified Garcia test (p<0.05; Fig 3). Following
NLRP3 siRNA mixture administration, there was a significant
improvement in the modified Garcia test at both 24
and 72 hours compared to ICH and siCtrl mice
(p<0.05). Consistent with neurological improvement, the
brain edema in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ipsi-BG) after
NLRP3 siRNA injection was also significantly reduced at
both 24 (ipsi-BG: 80.8860.29% vs ICH, 82.3860.33%,
p<0.05; vs siCtrl, 82.6860.35%, p<0.05) and 72 hours
(ipsi-BG: 81.6460.30% vs ICH, 83.1760.24%,
p<0.05; vs siCtrl, 82.9060.43%, p<0.05) compared to
ICH and siCtrl. With regard to the brain edema in the
ipsilateral cortex (ipsi-CX), it was only significantly
increased at 24 hours (ipsi-CX: sham, 79.1260.21% vs
ICH, 80.2260.26%, p<0.05), but not at 72 hours (ipsi-
CX: sham, 79.5960.20% vs ICH, 80.2760.13%,
p>0.05), and the siRNA treatment failed to reduce its
level at either 24 hours (ipsi-CX: 80. 0260.20% vs ICH,
80.2260.26%, p>0.05; vs siCtrl, 79.6260.82%,
p>0.05) or 72 hours (ipsi-CX: 79.5260.09% vs ICH,
80.2760.13%, p>0.05; vs siCtrl, 79.9260.32%,
p>0.05).

To determine the effect of NLRP3 on neutrophil
infiltration, we detected myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels
in brain tissue by Western blot as well as immunostaining
24 hours following ICH. Western blot results showed
that MPO levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere significantly
increased following ICH but were markedly
reduced after NLRP3 siRNA treatment compared to
ICH or siCtrl mice (p<0.05; Fig 4A). Consistently,
results from immunostaining indicated that NLRP3
siRNA treatment significantly reduced the number of
MPO-positive cells in the perihematomal area compared
to ICH or siCtrl mice (p<0.05; see Fig 4B, D).
mPTP Formed and mROS Increased following
ICH, Which Was Reversed by VDAC Inhibitor or
mROS-Specific Scavenger
We tested whether the mPTP components expressed
themselves in brain tissue and whether the mPTP formed
following ICH. Our Western blot results showed that
both VDAC and cyclophilin D (CypD) monomers were
expressed in brain tissue, but their protein levels did not
change in either the ipsilateral hemisphere or the contralateral
hemisphere 12 hours after ICH (Fig 5A). With
regard to mPTP formation, we examined VDAC dimer
formation by using in vivo chemical cross-linking with
DSS injection.16 Western blotting of cross-linked brain tissue
from sham and ICH showed that 30kDa monomeric
VDAC was the predominant form in both the ICH and
sham samples, whereas the dimer form of approximately
60kDa20,21 was increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in
ICH animals compared to the contralateral hemisphere
and sham with DSS injection (see Fig 5B).
The effects of pharmacological inactivation of the
mPTP on mROS production were assessed by intraventricular
injection of TRO-19622, a VDAC inhibitor, and Mito-
TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS-specific scavenger. ROS
assay showed that ROS was significantly increased 12 hours
following ICH, and both TRO-19622 and Mito-TEMPO
significantly reduced ROS levels (p<0.05; see Fig 5C).

caspase-1 levels (Fig 6). Similarly, ELISA showed that IL-
1b was also significantly reduced compared to ICH
groups (p<0.05).
Similar to the NLRP3 siRNA injection, the Western
blot showed that mPTP inhibition and Mito-
TEMPO significantly reduced MPO levels in brain tissue
24 hours following ICH (see Fig 6D). Consistently,
results from immunostaining indicated that the number
of MPO-positive cells in the perihematomal area was significantly
reduced compared to the number in ICH mice
(p<0.05; see Fig 6E, F).
mROS Induced by Rotenone Promoted mPTP
Formation in Naive Animals, Which Was
Reversed by VDAC Inhibitor or mROS-Specific
Scavenger
To confirm the role of mROS in NLRP3 inflammasome
activation, rotenone was intraventricularly injected to
induce mROS production22 in naive mice. ROS assay
revealed that mROS was significantly induced in the
brain as early as 1 hour following the rotenone injection.
At 4 hours after injection, mROS levels were less than
those at 1 hour, but still higher than in the naive group
(p<0.05; Fig 7). The inhibition of mPTP or mROS
reversed the effect of rotenone at 4 hours after injection
(p<0.05). Western blot results of in vivo chemical crosslinking16 showed that VDAC dimer was increased in the
ipsilateral hemisphere after rotenone injection compared
to contralateral and naive samples. In naive mice,
NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 were significantly increased
4 hours after rotenone injection, which were then
reversed by mPTP inhibition or mitochondrial ROS
scavenger (p<0.05).
Discussion
Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiology
of ICH-induced brain injury23; however, the mechanism
by which ICH stimulates the inflammatory response
remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated
an innate immune system component, the NLRP3
inflammasome, which may be involved in the

inflammatory signal amplification following ICH. The
NLRP3 inflammasome components were upregulated as
early as 3 hours following ICH, and NLRP3 knockdown
reduced IL-1b levels and neutrophil infiltration in the
perihematoma. Our results indicated that mPTP and
mROS contributed to NLRP3 inflammasome activation
in both the ICH model and naive animals with rotenone
injection. These observations suggested that blocking
NLRP3 may prove to be a useful therapeutic intervention
after ICH.
Mounting evidence indicates that the infiltration of
systemic immune cells, specifically blood-borne leukocytes
, is among the earliest events after ICH.23 The infiltrated
leukocytes may activate resident cells in the brain,
especially microglia, which are regarded as the first nonneuronal
cells to respond to brain injury.23 Consequently,
blood-borne leukocytes and activated glial cells release
proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1b,6,24,25 and subsequently
amplify leukocyte recruitment signals, which
have been proposed to exacerbate ICH-induced brain
injury in animal models.26
After establishing that IL-1b levels were enhanced
after ICH, the sources of IL-1b still need to be determined.
Recent evidence has alluded to the notion that a
multiple-protein complex, inflammasome, is the major
source of IL-1b.12 More than 20 members have been
reported in the inflammasome family. Unlike other
inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome exhibited its
functionality in both sterile inflammatory response and
antimicrobial response11; therefore, it gained more attention
in the pathophysiology study of human disease.27,28
It has been reported that NLRP3 played an important
role in a model of multiple sclerosis by exacerbating
CNS inflammation, and this was partly mediated by
caspase-1 and IL-18.28 Consistent with these studies, our
study showed that a transient increase of NLRP3,

activation of caspase-1, and releasing of IL-1b occurred
as early as 3 hours after ICH, peaking at 12 hours and
returning to the baseline by 72 hours. This resulted in a
significant increase in brain edema and neurological deficits
at 24 and 72 hours. Although previous observations
showed that caspase-1 inhibition reduced ICH induced
brain injury,7 NLRP3 inflammasome silencing with siRNAs
also showed similar protective effects by reducing
caspase-1 and IL-1b levels, thereby decreasing neutrophil
infiltration. Overall, our data indicate that the NLRP3
inflammasome may contribute to the amplification of
ICH-induced inflammation.
We have determined that the NLRP3 inflammasome
contributes to ICH-induced inflammatory
response; however, the molecular basis of NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in ICH-induced brain injury is far

from complete. Recent studies have linked ROS and
potassium efflux to inflammasomes activation in response
to diverse inflammatory danger signals.29 ROS production
was regarded as a necessary step for NLRP3 activation
, as ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) suppressed
NLRP3 inflammasome activation.30 The source of ROS
is currently unclear, but mitochondria are suspected to
be the main site of intracellular ROS generation.30,31
Zhou and colleagues found that the NLRP3 inflammasome
senses mitochondrial dysfunction, and both ROS
generation and inflammasome activation are suppressed
when mitochondrial activity is dysregulated.13 Intriguingly
, mitochondrial dysfunction also occurred in ICH
patients in the acute stage.32 One of the major causes of
mitochondrial dysfunction was cellular injury; for
instance, necrosis cell death happened at about 3 to 6
hours after ICH.33 Based on this evidence, we proposed
that mROS production following ICH resulted in the
initial inflammation response through the activation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome. The released active IL-1b
provides a signal to accumulate blood-borne leukocytes,
such as neutrophils to the perihematomal region. We
found a marked increase of ROS after ICH, and a specific
mROS scavenger, Mito-TEMPO, reduced NLRP3

levels as well as casppas-1 and IL-1b levels. Accordingly,
the infiltrated neutrophils numbers were also reduced, as
expected, by Mito-TEMPO. To further confirm the role
of mitochondrial ROS in inflammasome activation, rotenone22 (a respiration chain complex I inhibitor) was
administered in naive animals to induce mROS. This led
to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome being consistently
obtained, which was then suppressed by Mito-
TEMPO. Therefore, mitochondria ROS may be responsible
for NLRP3 inflammasome activation following ICH.
How are mitochondria ROS generated during
mitochondrial dysfunction? A special structure called
mPTP is associated with mROS production.16,34 It has
been reported that mPTP functions to enhance ROS
production, and the inhibition of mPTP attenuated reactive
oxygen/nitrogen species in target derived neurons in
the adult mouse brain.16,35 The mPTP assembles
between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes.
Generally, it consists of a dimer of VDAC in the outer
mitochondrial membrane and a dimer of adenine nucleotide
translocase in the inner membrane together with a
regulatory protein, CypD.35–38 The role of mPTP in
normal mitochondrial physiology is still unclear. However
, under pathophysiological conditions, such as oxidative
stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, the subunits of
mPTP are stimulated to form a pore between the inner
and outer membranes that allows free diffusion of metabolites
across the membranes. ROS production leads to
the induction of mPTP formation39 and consequently,
more ROS production is promoted by the mPTP opening.
The opening of the mPTP ultimately leads to mitochondrial
swelling, mitochondrial Ca21 efflux, ROS
production, and the release of apoptotic proteins.35,40
VDAC is an indispensable subunit for mPTP formation
and opening, which induces apoptosis41,42 and is ultimately
required for ROS production.13 Previous studies
found that endostatin-induced apoptosis is mediated by
mPTP opening, and VDAC siRNA attenuated
endostatin-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells.42 Being
consistent with previous reports, our data showed that
VDAC dimer was observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere,
but not contralateral hemisphere in both ICH and naive
mice with rotenone injection, which indicated the mPTP
formation and opening. The VDAC inhibitor reduced
ROS production, and NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1b levels.
In this study, VDAC and mPTP were detected at an
early stage of ICH in which ROS was mainly induced by
primary injury, and less leukocyte infiltration and cell
death occurred. The ROS level in brain tissue was rather
low; therefore, a relatively weak VDAC dimer band was
observed compared to VDAC monomer, which meant
the formation and opening of mPTP.41,42 Previous studies
suggested that moderate ROS production stimulated
by endogenous or exogenous danger signals leads to
inflammasome activation, and high ROS level causes cell
death.43 Our observation about VDAC level and mPTP
in ICH corresponded to the ROS level at the early stage
of ICH. Another possible explanation for the weak dimer
band was the use of a polyclonal antibody for VDAC
detection in our immunoblot. It has been reported that
the polyclonal antibody presented weaker dimer signals
compared to the monoclonal antibody.20
It is important to note that IL-1b production may also
be conducted through caspase-1 independent pathways, such
as matrix metalloproteinases, which may also process pro–IL-
1b to the active form.44 Because multiple factors are involved
in the inflammatory response, other cytokines processed
through inflammasome-dependent or independent pathways
mayalsocontributetotheinfl ammatory response following
ICH. Additionally, there are no NLRP3-specific inhibitors or
neutralizing antibodies, although several NLRP3 antagonists
are commercially available, such as glibenclamide, a proton
pump inhibitor, or Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase-1 inhibitor;
however, neither of them shows NLRP3-specific inhibition.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that the
NLRP3 inflammasome may contribute to ICH-induced
inflammatory activation, which increases caspase-1 and
IL-1b, and promotes neutrophil infiltration. Mitochondria
ROS may be a major trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome
activation (see Supplementary Fig 2). This study
provided new information on the NLRP3 inflammasome
following ICH, and the NLRP3 inflammasome may be a
novel therapeutic target for intervention in ICH patients.
