Microinfarcts are common in patients with cognitive decline and dementia. Allopurinol
(ALLO), a xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme inhibitor, has been found to reduce proinflammatory
molecules and oxidative stress in the vasculature. We here examined the effect of
pre-treatment with allopurinol on the cortical microinfarction. C57BL/6J mice were
subjected to a permanent single penetrating arteriole occlusion induced by two-photon
laser irradiation. Infarction volume, the activation of glial cells and nitrosative stress in the
ischemic brain was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Pre-treatment with ALLO
achieved 42% reduction of infarct volume and significantly reduced microglia infiltration,
astrocyte proliferation and nitrosative stress in the ischemic brain. These data indicate
that ALLO protects against microinfarcts possibly through inhibition of nitrosative stress
and attenuation of microglia infiltration as well as astrocytes reactivation.

1. Introduction
Increasing evidence has demonstrated the strong association
between microinfarcts and cognitive dysfunction (Brundel
et al., 2012). Microinfarcts have been detected in about 55%
of patients with mild cognitive decline (Sonnen et al., 2007)
and about 70% of patients with vascular dementia and
Alzheimer's disease (Burton et al., 2009; Haglund et al.,
2006). These lesions are often in company with small vessel
pathologies such as arteriolosclerosis or cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (Ihara, 2013; Smith et al., 2012). Recently, cortical
microinfarcts have received greater attention because cortical
microinfarcts, such as the parietal cortex, are highly associated
with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
(Soontornniyomkij et al., 2010;Okamoto et al., 2009). Different
from the big stroke, microinfarcts, in their early phase, are
usually clinically silent and go undetected on conventional
MRI because of their small sizes. The development for ideal

treatment for cerebral microinfarcts has been hindered by a
lack of animal models of cerebral microinfarction. Currently,
a two-photon laser-induced occlusion of penetrating arteries
in rodents has been shown to recapitulate the pathophysiological
features of microinfarcts including neuronal cell
death, oxidative stress and inflammation (Wang et al., 2012;
Arvanitakis et al., 2011; Caplan, 2015).
Allopurinol (ALLO), a xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme inhibitor
, is in clinical use to lower serum uric acid. Recently,
ALLO has been reported to improve neurological function in
stroke patients with high levels of serum uric acid (SUA). In
addition, pre-treatment with ALLO confers neuroprotection
in experimental models of focal ischemic stroke (Isik et al.,
2005). Furthermore, ALLO also has demonstrated its beneficial effects in hypertension which is a high risk of microinfarcts
(Sanchez-Lozada et al., 2008; Soletsky and Feig, 2012).
Interestingly, those neuroprotective effects are not associated
with SUA-lowering effect of ALLO (Dawson et al., 2009). Thus,
ALLO may yield additional benefits in addition to potent UA
reduction. Indeed, ALLO has been shown to improve
endothelial function, reduce the proinflammatory molecules
expression and attenuate oxidative stress in the vasculature,
which all contribute to the alleviation of infarct volume in
ischemic stroke (Itoh et al., 1986; Dawson et al., 2009; Martz
et al., 1989). Therefore, the objective of this study was to
assess the neuroprotective effect of allopurinol in a mouse
(C57BL/6J) model of laser-induced microinfarction.
2. Results
2.1. Occlusion of a single penetrating arteriole
Maps of the brain vasculature of anesthetized mice were
obtained using in vivo two-photon laser-scanning microscopy
(TPLSM) by labeling the blood plasma with fluorescein-dextran
FITC. Candidate arterioles for clotting are identified from the
map. The green laser light was placed on the segment which
courses parallel to the cortical surface and proximal to where
the arteriole dove into the brain. The occlusion in the target
arteriole was induced by two-photon laser irradiation through
the thin cranial window in the parietal cortex. Soon after the
extravasation of fluorescein-dextran outside the vessel lumen,
a clot was formed with a complete cessation of RBC movement
in the target arteriole. Neighboring surface vessels and capillaries
remained flowing. We kept our observation for 1 h after
the insult to ensure no recanalization (Fig. 1).
2.2. Pretreatment with ALLO reduced the neuron death
A cylindrical region of tissue infarction was formed over a
course of 7 d. The infarction was devoid of staining for the panneuronal
marker NeuN. ALLO was given 1 h prior to the
occlusion. The average microinfarction volumes at 24 h were
145.8077.87 μm3 and 109.10712.22μm3 in the normal controls
and the ALLO group, respectively. The infarction progressively
expanded over time. In the controls, the average microinfarction
volume was 196.8076.35 μm3 at 3 d and 227.20714.50μm3
at 7 d. ALLO significantly prevented the progression of the
microinfarction lesion. The average microinfarction volume
only increased to 125.9079.73μm3 at 3 d and 131.1074.10μm3
at 7 d. There was no significant difference in the infarct volume
between 3 d and 7 d in ALLO group. Compared with the
controls, pretreatment with ALLO significantly reduced infarct
volume up to about 42% at 7 d. (Fig. 2).
2.3. Pretreatment with ALLO alleviated microglia
infiltration
The microglia infiltration induced by a single penetrating
arteriole occlusion gradually increased during the first week.
The infarct tissue was infiltrated with Iba-1 positive microglia.
The average numbers of infiltrated microglia at 24 h were
129. 8073.43 and 3.3373.69 in the normal controls and the
ALLO group, respectively. While at 3 d following the occlusion
, the highly reactive microglia were aggregated and filled
in the cavity. The average numbers of reactive microglia were
141.5077.08 and 29.0073.27 in the normal controls and the
ALLO group, respectively. At 7 d, further loss of neurons was
evident in accompany with microgliosis. The average numbers
of reactive microglia were 155.0074.19 and 48.6774.54 in
the normal controls and the ALLO group, respectively. Compared
with the normal controls, pretreatment with ALLO
significantly alleviated microglia infiltration (Figs. 2 and 3).
2.4. Pretreatment with ALLO alleviated astrocytes
reactivation
The reactivation of astrocyte gradually increased following
the single penetrating arteriole occlusion. The lesion was
bounded by an obvious rim of reactive GFAP-positive astrocytes
at 3 d following the occlusion. The average reactive
astrocytes at 3 d were 474.20735.69 and 49.6777.22 in the
normal controls and the ALLO group, respectively. At 7 d,
astrocytes were highly reactivated and tightly surrounded the
lesions, the numbers were 627.80713.71 and 59.6778.23 in
the normal controls and the ALLO group, respectively. Compared
with controls, pre-treatment with ALLO significantly
alleviated astrocyte reactivation (Figs. 2 and 4).
2.5. Pretreatment with ALLO reduced nitrosative stress
The deposition of 3-nitrotyrosine (NT), a marker of nitrosative
stress, gradually increased during the first week. There was
little NT immunoreactivity in the lesion at 24 h. However, the
deposition of NT was evident in the peri-infarct region at 3 d.
NT further increased and distributed both in the core and
peri-infarct region at 7 d. The average depositions of NT at 3 d
were 29.1772.37 and 2.0070.37 in the normal controls and
ALLO group, respectively. The depositions were increased to
102.5072.19 and 2.1770.28, in the normal controls and ALLO
group at 7 d, respectively. Compared with controls, pretreatment
with ALLO significantly inhibited the nitrosative
stress (Fig. 5).
3. Discussion
Microinfarcts are frequently seen in autopsies of patients
with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Pathologically,

microinfarcts are delimited microscopic regions of cellular
death which are accompanied with inflammation and astrogliosis
(Smith et al., 2012; Jellinger, 2014). Consistently, neuron
loss and micrglia infiltration were evident in the ischemic
core which was surrounded by pronounced GFAP glial reaction
in this laser-induced model of microinfarction.
The infarct volume progressively expanded during thefirst
week. When animals were pre-treated with ALLO, the infarct
volume was statistically reduced. In the big stroke, ALLO
treatment has been reported to reduce infarct volume by 33%
reduction (Isik et al., 2005; Martz et al., 1989). Interestingly,
ALLO treatment achieved 42% reduction of infarct volume in

microinfarction, suggesting that ALLO may confer better
protection in microinfarcts.
Inflammation has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of big
ischemic stroke (Lakhan et al., 2009). Similarly, inflammation
is a key contributor to the outcome of microinfarcts. During
this micro-stroke, inflammatory cells are activated and infiltrated
into the ischemic region which in turn produces
proinflammatory cytokines, expanding the ischemic damage
(Ives et al., 2015). Consistently, we found that microglia were
hypertrophied and infiltrated into ischemic region in control
animals. Hypertrophied microglia cells were further aggregated
in the ischemic core where the neuron loss occurred in
a time-dependent manner following the occlusion of cortical
penetrating arteriole, suggesting a correlation between
microglia infiltration and ischemic injury. In contrast, reactive
microglia were much less pronounced and confined to a
much smaller region in ALLO-treated animals. Astrocytes
normally maintain homeostasis of neuronal function and
have a supportive role for neurons (Panickar and Norenberg,
2005). However, overactive astrocytes not only lose their
protective abilities but also could be harmful to neurons
(Ding, 2014). Indeed, astrogliosis is one pathological feature
of small infarcts. Gliosis in white matter tracts disrupts the
white matter connections, which is linked to brain dysfunction
in cerebral small vessel diseases (Pekny et al., 2014).
Thus, control of reactive astrocytes has already emerged as
an attractive strategy for stroke treatment. In this study,
astrocytes were much hypertrophied in peri-infarct area in
control animals whereas astrocytes were much less activated
in the ALLO-treated animals, indicating that ALLO treatment
is beneficial in controlling ischemia-induced overreaction of
astrocytes.

The oxidative stress is a main event leading to brain
damage after cerebral ischemia (Radak et al., 2014; Pacher
et al., 2007). Consistently, oxidative stress is also involved in
microinfarcts whereas inhibition of oxidative stress is neuroprotective.
In the present study, nitrosative stress was
higher in the ischemic core and surrounding penumbra area
during ischemia, which is in agreement with previous reports
(Sakamoto et al., 1991). Pre-treatment with ALLO significantly
reduced NT deposition. Interestingly, the reduction of NT
deposition by ALLO was in parallel to the inhibition of
inflammation. Given that ALLO is a potent free radical
scavenger and an antioxidant in addition to the inhibition
of xanthine oxidase. The present data suggested that ALLO
may inhibit inflammation through its anti-oxidant activity.
However, further study is needed to reveal the exact relationship
between nitrosative stress and inflammation in
microinfarcts.
In summary, we found that ALLO could significantly
decrease the infarct volume, inhibit inflammation and nitrosative
stress in this mouse model. This study may have
clinical implications. Gout and long-lasting, high SUA levels
are independent risk factors of cardiovascular diseases
including heart disease and stroke. ALLO is the most frequently
used SUA-lowering medicine and is often prescribed
to hypertensive patients with cardiovascular diseases to
reduce their SUA levels. Given that ALLO is also beneficial
to microinfarcts, long-term use of ALLO might decrease the
risk of microinfarcts in patients with cardiovascular diseases.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Animal preparation and surgical procedures
All animal procedures were approved by the Sun Yat-sen
University (Guangzhou, China) Committee on the Care and
Use of Animals. A total of 108 male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks),
ranging from 20 to 25 g in weight, were used in this experiment.
All mice were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal injection
of 1% pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and positioned in a
stereotaxic frame (RWD life science company, Shenzhen,
China). As described before (Nishimura et al., 2010; Nguyen
et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2013a, 2013b), a 22mm 2 cranial
window was performed over the right parietal cortex (2mm
bregma, 1.7 mm lateral) with the micro-drill and glued with a
metal plate at the edge of the cranial window. The mouse
was fixed then fixed on the stage of Leica DM6000. Artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was perfused during the whole
surgical procedures to keep the window moist. Throughout
this experimental study, the body temperatures were kept
constant in the 36.8 1C with a feedback controlled heating pad
(RWD life science company, Shenzhen, China).
4.2. Drug administration and experimental groups
Allopurinol (A8003, Sigma, Ger) was suspended in 0.5%
carboxymethylcellulose (C5678, Sigma, Ger) solution and
administered intraperitoneally to prepare the final concentration
of 5 mg/mL for injection of 135 mg/kg per mouse. This
dosage has been testified effective in cerebral ischemia and
oxidative stress (Palmer et al., 1993). The control group was
given an equal dose of solution which includes 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose
and 0.9% NaCl. ALLO and the equal saline
would be treated 1 h before the following occlusion to test the
effect of ALLO in microinfarction. In ischemic stroke, inflammation
is changing at different stages: acute, subacute
phases (12–72 h after the onset) and recovery phase (which
occurs 1 week after the stroke onset) (Shichita et al., 2014).
Three different time points after microinfarction would be
observed: 24 h, 3 d and 7 d.
4.3. Microscopy of cerebral vasculature and penetrating
arteriole occlusion
2000 KD FITC-dextran (FD20, Sigma, Ger) was injected into the
tail vein. With a low magnification, a Leica 0.12 numerical
aperture (NA) together with a 10 magnification air objective
, we can obtain a three-dimensional stack of images of
the cerebral vessels throughout the cranial window (Fig. 1A).
For high-resolution imaging, a Leica NA 0.95 together with
the 25 magnification water-immersion objectives was used.
A penetrating arteriole, about 15–20 um in diameter and
10 um/ms in velocity, was selected as our target vessel. Before
occlusion (Fig. 1B and D), we would place the target arteriole
in the center of the screen. The segment, which coursed
parallel to the cortical surface, was magnified to allow for
easy verification of clot formation. Bleach mode was used to
injure the endothelium. These bleach points must be located
within the vessel lumen a few micrometers from the vessel
wall. Irradiation was started with 800 nm laser. The intensity
(Max. power 3.5 W) was controlled by EOM setting at 30%
(1.05 W) and was depth-dependent. The energy was gradually
increased by 10% until some extravasation was observed
(Shih et al., 2013a, 2013b). Irradiation was continued until a
clot was visualized and the motion of RBCs was stalled
(Fig. 1C and E). We would keep an observation for about 1 h
until the downstreamflow was redistributed and stabilized, if
there was any recanalization, irradiation would be repeated
until theflow stopped. Discard the model with a hemorrhage
or a diffuse burnt. The diameters of cortical microinfarcts in
post-mortem studies of patients with dementia are on an
order of 0.1–1mm (Shih et al., 2013a, 2013b). Lesions in our
studies were all typically microscopic (o1 mm).
4.4. Immunefluorescence
Mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital (50 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline. The ipsilateral
cortex of the photothombosis was removed and sandwiched
between two glass slides separated by a distance of
2.5 mm to ensure a flat section. The tissue would be retained
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 h and then immersed in 20%
and 30% sucrose for 3 d at 4 1C. Primary antibodies were
monoclonal mouse anti-mouse Neun IgG (1:200 dilution,
Millipore, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Neun IgG
(1:500 dilution, Abcam, UK ), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse
Iba1 IgG (1:500 dilution, Wako, Japan) (Fig. 3), polyclonal rabbit
anti-mouse GFAP IgG (1:500 dilution, Abcam, UK) (Fig. 4) and
mouse anti-mouse mouse 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) IgG (1:100

dilution, Abcam, UK) (Fig. 5). Free-floating sections were
incubated overnight at 4 1C in an antibody solution. Wash it
4 times in PBS for 5 min each cycle on an orbital shaker and
then incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h in the room
temperature. Wash it again 3 times in PBS for 5 min each
cycle. All slides were then sealed with DAPI and glass coverslip.
The numbers of target cells or depositions per field of
view (200) were calculated with ImageJ software package.
4.5. Statistical analysis
Values are presented as mean7SD. The volume of microinfarcts
and occurrence of active microglia, astrocytes and 3-
nitrotyrosine for mice in two groups at 24 h, 3 d, 7 d were
tested by a t test, respectively. Differences were considered
statistically significant at po0.05.
