The cerebral small vessel system plays a fundamental role 
in maintaining higher brain function.1 Although lacunar 
stroke has been recognized as a disease in which small vessels 
are mainly affected, advances in neuroradiological examination
extend our knowledge of small vessel disease to white 
matter lesions, microbleeds, and cortical microinfarction.2
Accumulating evidence indicates that the risk factors and the 
therapeutic strategies are different for large vessel disease 
and small vessel disease.3 Moreover, the recent discoveries 
on monogenic disorders, which mainly affect small vessels, 
clearly indicate that the human cerebral small vessels have 
distinct molecular characteristics of cerebral large vessels.4
However, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of 
small vessel disease and how it is different from that of large 
vessel disease. The investigation of hereditary small vessel 
disease is necessary to clarify the molecular pathogenesis of 
cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is the most common 
dominant inherited CSVD, whereas cerebral autosomal recessive
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
(CARASIL) is a rare form of inherited CSVD.5,6
Fukutake6,7 has proposed the clinical triad for CARASIL, 
leukoencephalopathy, alopecia, and lumbago and has summarized
the clinical findings of CARASIL in these patients. 
The identification of the causative gene for CARASIL allows 
a new understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CSVD.5
Although CARASIL has been considered to be restricted to 
Japan, we now know that CARASIL exists in other populations.
In this review, we update the clinical findings of 
CARASIL confirmed by genetic analysis and molecular 
pathogenesis of CARASIL.
What Is CARASIL?
In 1976, Maeda et al8 reported familial unusual encephalopathy
of the Binswanger’s type without hypertension in siblings 
whose parents were consanguineous. They showed early 
adult-onset dementia, pseudobulbar palsy, and pyramidal 
and extrapyramidal symptoms. Postmortem studies revealed 
diffuse and focal demyelination with sparing of U-fibers, 
multiple small foci of perivascular softening in the cerebral 
white matter and the basal ganglia, and severe arteriosclerotic 
changes in the meningeal small arteries and long arteries in 
the cerebral white matter. The other characteristic features 
were severe lumbago and alopecia during the teenage years. 
In 1995, Fukutake and Hirayama6 studied the reported cases, 
including their own cases of juvenile-onset Binswanger-type 
encephalopathy accompanied by alopecia and lumbago in an 
autosomal recessive form and proposed new disease criteria 
for CARASIL.
In 2009, Hara et al5 identified that the mutation in the hightemperature
requirement serine peptidase A1 (HTRA1) gene 
codes a protease in patients with CARASIL. To date, 10 mutations
in the HTRA1 gene have been identified in 12 families 
(Figure 1A; Table).5,6,9–19 Most patients with CARASIL have 
been reported in Japan; however, in families with CARASIL, 
we cannot find any founder haplotype that explains this 
regional accumulation. Moreover, 2 Chinese families,15,16 2 
white families,17,18 and 1 Turkish family19 have been identified 
as having CARASIL. As described later in this review, clinical
heterogeneity has been recognized in CARASIL. These 
findings indicate that CARASIL is not unique to the Japanese 
population and might be underdiagnosed.
Clinical Features of CARASIL
We have obtained and summarized clinical features of 
patients with genetically proven CARASIL from the literature
or medical records (Table).5,6,9–19 Patients with CARASIL 
present with early adult-onset dementia, gait disturbance, alopecia
, and low back pain.5,6 Motor and mental abnormalities 
develop at the age of ≈30 years (dementia: mean age of onset, 
35.1 years [range, 24–50 years]; gait disturbance: mean age of 
onset, 30.7 years [range, 23–39 years]). Then, a diffuse symmetrical
white matter lesion is noticed on neuroradiological

examination, suggesting CARASIL. The patients do not have 
hypertension or diabetes mellitus, which are the major risk 
factors for sporadic CSVD. Diffuse thinning of hair without
hairline recession beginning during the teenage years or 
when patients are in their 20s has been recognized in 9 of 12 
families (mean age, 16.7 years; range, 0–27 years). Pubic hair 
loss and body hair loss have not been reported. Acute mid- to 
lower-back pain has been noticed at a mean age of 24.9 years 
(range, 14–39 years). Mood changes (apathy and irritability
), pseudobulbar palsy, hyper-reflexia, Babinski sign, and 
urinary incontinence are frequently observed. Motor and cognitive
functions slowly decline, and 7 of 13 patients needed 
wheelchairs by 30 to 40 years of age. An acute ischemic 
stroke event has been reported in 23.1%, and no hemorrhagic 
stroke events have been reported. Five of 13 patients (38.5%) 
have experienced horizontal nystagmus. Two of 13 patients 
(15.4%) have experienced advanced-stage seizures. Obvious 
migraines have not been reported in these patients, and there 
has been no skin color change in the extremities. Retina and 
kidney involvement have not been reported; however, in 
other small vessel diseases, involvement of retinal vessels or 
involvement of renal dysfunction has been reported.
Neuroradiological Findings in CARASIL
We have directly reviewed brain MRI results from 7 patients 
with CARASIL (Table).5,6,9,11–14 White matter hyperintensity
on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuation inversion recovery 
images is symmetrically distributed and located periventricular
to subcortical white matter (Figure 1B). Abnormalities are 
observed in the white matter of the anterior temporal lobe, 
cerebellum, brain stem, and external capsule. Although these 
findings resemble those of cerebral autosomal dominant 
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
, it is not clear whether the white matter changes in the 
anterior temporal poles and external capsule, which are characteristic
early signs in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy,20
are also observed in early stages of CARASIL. The magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy finding of a patient with dementia 
and pyramidal signs has shown a normal N-acetyl aspartate 
peak in the white matter lesion, indicating the absence of 
neuroaxonal degeneration.21 In contrast, the choline peak was 
elevated, which is a finding consistent with ischemia-induced 
demyelination. Lacunar infarctions are detected in the thalamus
, basal ganglia, and deep white matter. At the progressive
stage, diffuse brain atrophy and both lobar and nonlobar 
microbleeds in cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum are 
observed. U-fibers are relatively preserved even during the 
late stage. Brain magnetic resonance angiography and conventional
angiography do not show any pathological changes. 
Single-photon emission computed tomography shows hypoperfusion
in the frontal lobe. On spinal MRI, spondylosis 
deformans and disk degeneration are observed in cervical 
and lumbar spine at the age of ≈30 years. Interestingly, these 
findings have not been identified during their early stages. 
Therefore, it is still unknown why lumbago symptoms occur 
during the teenage years.
Cerebral Small Vessel Pathology in CARASIL
The autopsy findings of CARASIL have been reported in 
3 instances: in a patient with p.Arg302end, a mutation in 
the HTRA1 gene; in a sibling with p.Ala252Thr; and in the 
original patient.8,12,22,23 In the cerebral small arteries, smooth 
muscle cells were extensively lost, even in arteries without

factor–binding protein domain (red; 35–111 aa); the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain (blue; 114–155 aa); the trypsin-like serine
protease domain (orange; 204–364 aa); and the PDZ domain (green; 382–473 aa). All individuals are homozygotes for missense or 
nonsense mutations, except for the patient with p.[Glu42fs];[Ala321Thr].5,6,9–19 B, Brain images of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery of 
the patient with p.Arg370end. Extensive white matter lesions involving the anterior temporal lobe are seen. These findings are accompanied
by multiple lacunes in the periventricular regions and the thalami. The hyperintensities in the external and internal capsules are also 
observed.

sclerotic changes. Sclerotic changes were mild and infrequent
; most of the arteries were enlarged rather than exhibiting
luminal stenosis. Tunica media of the cerebral small 
arteries exhibited hyalinosis and were immunopositive for 
fibrinogen. These pathological findings resemble those 
observed in nonhereditary ischemic CSVD.24 In the patients 
with nonhereditary ischemic CSVD, marked degeneration 
of vascular smooth muscle cells with collapse and dilatation
in the cerebral small arteries, the so-called earthen pipe 
phenomenon, were observed.24 These changes might disturb 
autoregulatory mechanisms for cerebral blood flow, resulting 
in ischemic changes in the deep white matter.25
The internal elastic membrane, which is composed of elastin
, is split into multiple layers and fragmented. Some intima is 
thickened with fibrosis and involves myointimal cells, which 
were sparsely stained by α-smooth muscle actin antibody. 
Arterial adventitia was thin and decreased immunoreactivity 
for type I, type III, and type VI collagens.23 These changes 
were relatively limited in cerebral small arteries and were not 
detected in intracranial large arteries and extracranial arteries. 
Lysosome-like bodies were found in the cytoplasm of smooth 
muscle cells in small arteries.12 No obvious deposit or inclusion
, including granular osmiophilic material or amyloid, was 
observed. Diffuse myelin pallor in the cerebral white matter 
with sparing U-fibers and multiple small foci of perivascular 
softening in the cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, and brain 
stem were observed.
Loss of HTRA1 Protease Function  
Causes CARASIL
The HTRA1 gene consists of 9 exons producing HTRA1, a 
serine protease belonging to the HTRA protein family whose 
members have dual activities as chaperones and serine proteases
(Figure 1A).26 HTRA1 has an N-terminal insulin-like 
growth factor–binding protein domain, a Kazal-type serine
protease inhibitor domain, a trypsin-like serine protease 
domain, and a C-terminal PDZ domain.27 HTRA1 proteases 
exist as trimers, thus allowing communication between adjacent
subunits to regulate protease. The activation cascade is 
initiated by the ligand-dependent interaction of neighboring 
HTRA1s in a trimer, thereby inducing the proper adjustment 
of the activation domain His220, Asp250, and Ser328 in the 
trypsin-like serine protease domain.28,29
To date, 10 mutations in the HTRA1 gene have been identified
in 13 patients from 12 families (Figure 1A).5,6,9–19 They 
include 7 missense mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, and 1 
deletion mutation. The premature termination codons, which 
are caused by the nonsense or deletion mutations, fulfill the 
criteria of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, indicating 
the marked reduction of the amounts of mRNA from these 
alleles.5,30 All of the missense mutations were located in or 
around the protease domain of HTRA1, suggesting the reduction
in the protease activity. The disease-associated mutant 
HTRA1s (p.Ala252Thr, p.Arg274Gln, and p.Val297Met) 
decrease their protease activity.5,14 These findings indicate 
that CARASIL is caused by the loss of HTRA1 or its protease
activity. Among the mutations with HTRA1, the residual 
HTRA1 activity of p.Arg302end, which completely loses its 
protease domain, should be the lowest. Therefore, we can 
speculate that patients with p.Arg302end show the most severe 
phenotype with CARASIL; however, the onset and the clinical 
severities are similar for the patients with p.Arg302end and 
other patients (Table).
Dysregulation of Transforming Growth Factorβ Signaling Underlies Molecular Pathogenesis 
in CARASIL
Studies have shown that HTRA protein decreases transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β) family signaling.31 TGF-β is a 
cytokine that promotes cell differentiation and fibrous proliferation
in response to tissue damage and has an important 
role in vascular integrity.32 Loss of HTRA1 activity leads 
to an increase in TGF-β signaling. CARASIL-associated 
mutant HTRA1s fail to decrease TGF-β family signaling.5
Moreover, the extra domain A of fibronectin and versican, 
which are induced by increased TGF-β signaling, accumulate
in the hypertrophic intima of cerebral small arteries.5 In 
addition, hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix protein that is 
induced by TGF-β1 signaling, also accumulates in the small 
cerebral arterial walls.30 In endothelial cells of small cerebral 
arteries, the expression of phosphorylated Smad2, which is 
induced by TGF-β1 signaling, increased. Finally, TGF-β1 and 
latency-associated peptide, which forms a complex with TGF-
β1, increase in the cerebral small arteries of patients with 
CARASIL.5,30 No expression of extra domain A of fibronectin 
was detected in arterial walls of coronal tissue, renal arteries, 
or the aorta from a patient with CARASIL. These findings 
indicate that the increased TGF-β signaling plays a pivotal 
role in the pathogenesis of CSVD in CARASIL. Acceleration 
of TGF-β signaling might cause the degeneration of vascular 
smooth muscle cells because TGF-β signaling has an important
role in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle 
cells. In extracentral nervous system symptoms of CARASIL, 
upregulation of TGF-β family signaling might cause alopecia 
or spondylosis deformans.33,34
How the HTRA1 Inhibits TGF-β Signaling
TGF-β signaling is temporally and spatially regulated by 
balance among maturation, sequestration, and presentation
(Figure 2).32,35 TGF-β is synthesized as a homodimeric 
proprotein (proTGF-β) and is subsequently cleaved into 
an N-terminal latency-associated peptide and a C-terminal 
mature TGF-β by a proprotein convertase, such as furin, in 
the trans-Golgi network. Latency-associated peptide forms 
a noncovalent complex with a dimer of mature TGF-β. This 
complex binds to a latent TGF-β–binding protein, and the 
bound complex is then secreted and anchored to the extracellular
matrix, resulting in the sequestration of the mature TGF-
β in the extracellular space. The sequestered mature TGF-β
is activated by serine protease, matrix metalloproteinase, 
or acidic microenvironments in the extracellular space. The 
extracellular matrix, which stores TGF-β in a complex with 
latency-associated peptide and latent TGF-β–binding protein, 
also regulates the bioavailability of TGF-β. The activation of 
mature TGF-β is the rate-limiting step for TGF-β signaling.

Nozaki et al Clinical and Molecular Features of CARASIL 3451
Tighter regulation of bioavailability of TGF-β in intracellular
and extracellular spaces is important for regulating its 
signaling.
For the downregulation mechanism of TGF-β signaling by 
HTRA1, we have proposed that HTRA1 cleaves the prodomain
of proTGF-β1 in the endoplasmic reticulum before furin 
processes proTGF-β1 in the trans-Golgi network.30 The aberrant
cleaved products of proTGF-β1 are degradated by the 
endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation system, leading
to a reduced amount of mature TGF-β1. In contrast, it has 
been reported that HTRA1 cleaves mature TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 
receptors in extracellular space.31,36,37 However, all results in 
regard to the downregulation of TGF-β signaling by HTRA1 
were obtained by the overexpression conditions; thus, the 
downregulation mechanism under physiological conditions is 
still unclear.
Why Vascular Pathology Is Predominant in 
Cerebral Small Vessels
The selectivity of cerebral small vessels in CARASIL is not 
explained by the expression of HTRA1. Although the specificity
of the antibodies has not been evaluated fully, HTRA1 is 
ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues.38 Therefore, 
we have to consider a unique role of HTRA1 or TGF-β family 
signaling in maintaining the integrity of cerebral small vessels.
TGF-β1 is secreted from astrocytes, microglia, smooth 
muscle cells, and endothelial cells in neurovascular units and 
plays an important role in maintaining their function and survival.39 HTRA1 is expressed in endothelial cells and astrocytes
in cerebral small vessels.40 HTRA1 cleaves proTGF-β1 
and downregulates TGF-β1 synthesis in these cells.30 The 
intracellular cleavage of proTGF-β1 is a unique mechanism 
for regulating the amount of TGF-β family protein, indicating 
that this mechanism has some specific role for circumstancedependent
regulation of TGF-β signaling in cerebral small 
vessels.
The other factors that regulate TGF-β signaling are an activation
system and receptors for TGF-β. Fibrinogen-bound 
latent TGF-β interacts with astrocytes, leading to active TGF-
β formation.39 In CARASIL patients, fibrinogen deposited in 
tunica media of cerebral small arteries might accelerate the 
TGF-β signaling in cerebral small vessels. TGF-β1 binds type 
I and type II receptors on the plasma membrane, and each type 
involves several different receptors. On ligand-induced heteromeric
complex formation, the type I receptor is phosphorylated
by the type II receptor. TGF-β signaling is temporally 
and spatially regulated by the diversity of these receptors and 
coreceptors in each cell type.41 Different expressions of the 
receptors in each type of cell in cerebral small arteries might 
be associated with the vascular pathology of CARASIL. The 
profiles of the receptors and coreceptors in the cerebral small 
arteries should be elucidated.
Clinical Heterogeneity of CARASIL
Although leukoencephalopathy, lumbago, and alopecia are 
the clinical triad of CARASIL, we have realized that some 
patients with mutations in the HTRA1 gene do not show signs 
of alopecia (Table). The frequency of alopecia in families with 
genetically proven CARASIL is 72.7%. Moreover, when low 
back pain begins, sometimes there is no apparent neuroradiological
finding in the lumbar spine.
We have to be cautious because most of the reported cases 
of CARASIL are suspected because of the existence of earlyonset
leukoencephalopathy. However, there is a possibility 
that residual protease activity could affect the severity of the 
disease. Thus, we imagine that some patients show later-onset 
Figure 2. The schema of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) processing and possible interactions between TGF-β and HTRA1. A, 
TGF-β is synthesized as a proprotein (proTGF-β), which undergoes proteolytic processing.32,35 The proTGF-β is then cleaved by furin 
convertase. The cleaved products yield a small latent TGF-β complex, in which the latency-associated peptides and the TGF-β dimer 
are connected. The small latent TGF-β complex binds with latent TGF-β binding protein and is secreted into the extracellular space and 
anchored in the extracellular matrix. Chemical stress or proteases can open small latent TGF-β complex to release the TGF-β dimer. The 
TGF-β dimer binds to TGF-β receptor. HTRA1 might cleave (A) proTGF-β,30 (B) TGF-β dimer,31,36 (C) TGF-β receptor,37 or (D) extracellular 
matrix proteins.26 The cleaved products are degradated, resulting in the reduction of TGF-β signaling.

and milder phenotypes. In elderly individuals, it is more difficult
to suspect the mutation in HTRA1 gene because these 
individuals frequently lose hair and have spondylotic deformities.
Therefore, investigation of HTRA1 gene is of interest in 
these populations.
Does heterozygosity for HTRA1 mutation cause development
of CSVD? Heterozygote individuals with p.Arg302end 
did not exhibit early adult-onset dementia or gait disturbance. 
Their HTRA1 activity is speculated as being half that of normal 
individuals, suggesting that 50% activity of HTRA1 is enough 
to prevent the progression of CARASIL. There have been no 
reports of patients with early-onset leukoencephalopathy, alopecia
, and lumbago with heterozygote mutations in HTRA1
gene. In 7 of 10 families with HTRA1 mutations indicated in 
the neurological information of the parents, there is a history 
of cerebral infarction in ≥2 of the parents. Four individuals 
with p.Pro285Leu, p.Gly295Arg, p.Glu42fs, or p.Ala321Thr 
heterozygotes exhibited white matter lesions.16–18 However, 
CSVD is frequently observed in the elderly. Therefore, further 
evaluation of individuals with HTRA1 mutations is needed to 
elucidate this issue.
Therapeutic Strategy for CARASIL
Increasing the activity of HTRA1 or decreasing the TGF-β
activity is a therapeutic strategy for CARASIL. For patients 
with p.Arg370end mutation, the drugs that read through the 
premature termination codon might be effective in increasing
the active HTRA1.30 The product of p.Arg370end retains 
normal protease activity, and it has been revealed that the 
C-terminal PDZ domain is dispensable in HTRA1.5 Thus, the 
inhibitor of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay should increase 
the amounts of active HTRA1.30,42 The denatured citrate 
synthase, which increases activity of HTRA1 by promoting 
HTRA1 multimerization, could also be useful.29
Inhibition of accelerated TGF-β signaling is another therapeutic
strategy for CARASIL, and it is also used to prevent the 
progression of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome. Marfan 
syndrome is caused by the mutation in fibrillin-1 gene, resulting
in the increase in TGF-β signaling.32 Interestingly, in the 
aortic artery, degeneration of smooth muscle cells and fragmentation
of elastic membrane are observed. These histological
findings partially resemble those of CARASIL. In Marfan 
syndrome, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, which 
inhibits TGF-β signaling, prevents the dilatation of aorta in 
mice models and in human patients.43,44 Moreover, several 
lines of drugs for blocking TGF-β signaling in other diseases 
might be therapeutic candidates for CARASIL.45
Perspectives
The cerebral small vessel is not a single structure and has 
marked diversity, not only in size but also in histology, function
, and regulation of the nervous system.1 Moreover, the 
pericyte and astrocyte are also diverse, depending on the locus 
in the brain. These marked diversities of the small arteries have 
been given little attention, making it difficult to understand the 
molecular mechanism and pathogenesis of these structures. 
Although most of the pathological studies have focused on the 
arteries having internal elastic membrane and smooth muscle 
cells, the most important and unique structure in small vessels 
is the capillary, which loses the internal elastic membrane and 
smooth muscle cells. Instead of these structures, the capillary 
is surrounded by the pericyte and astrocyte. The investigation 
of whether the dysfunction of capillary, pericyte, or astrocyte 
contributes to the hyperintensity on MRI and the mental or 
motor deterioration in humans might be of interest. To address 
this issue, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms for 
CARASIL will provide new insights on significance of cerebral
small arteries in humans and will allow new opportunities 
for therapeutic strategies, not only for CARASIL but also for
