Transmembrane protein 166 (TMEM166) is a lysosomal/endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein found in
various species where it acts as a regulator of programmed cell death, mediating both autophagy and apoptosis.
In the present study, we investigated the role of TMEM166 following MCAO injury in rats to determine
whether the structural damages following injury were orchestrated in part by TMEM166. One hundred and
fifty six male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham, MCAO, MCAO+control
siRNA, MCAO+TMEM166 siRNA. Outcomes were measured including mortality rate, brain edema, BBB disruption
, and neurobehavioral testing. Western blotting techniques measured the expression of key proautophagic
and apoptotic proteins such as TMEM166, Beclin-1, cleaved casepase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax. The
study found that TMEM166 siRNA treatment significantly reduced the mortality rate, cerebral edema, neurobehavioral
deficits, and BBB disruption as measured by Evan's blue assay following MCAO injury. Immunohistochemical
staining and western blotting analysis demonstrated an increased expressions of TMEM166,
Beclin-1, LC3, cleaved casepase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax in the infarcted areas. This study suggests that TMEM166 induces
autophagy and apoptosis may in fact play a significant role in cell death following MCAO injury and its
mediation may be through the crosstalk of Bcl-2. By blocking the activity of TMEM166 using siRNA, we were
able to prevent the cell loss that occured following cerebral ischemia injury. This translated into a preservation
of functional integrity and an improvement in mortality.

Introduction
Cerebral stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the second
overall cause of mortality worldwide. With close to 80% of all
stroke subtypes being ischemic, research has focused extensively on
means of reducing consequences following ischemic stroke episodes;
this includes reducing both neuronal and non-neuronal cell death.
At least three distinct modes of cell death have been identified and
implicated with the ischemic stroke process — they include necrosis,
apoptosis, and autophagy. While the first two have been extensively
researched and supported, the discussion around autophagy remains
inconclusive. This is in part because of the mixed research suggesting
autophagy is an essential process for cellular metabolism and survival
(Komatsu et al., 2005; Kuma et al., 2004; Shintani and Klionsky,
2004), while on the other hand, it may also be involved in cell
death (Ohsawa et al., 1998; Uchiyama, 2001; Yu et al., 2004; Zhu et
al., 2007), specifically orchestrating the effects in cerebral ischemia
(Chu, 2008; Park et al., 2009; Uchiyama et al., 2008b).
Transmembrane protein 166 (TMEM166) is a lysosomal/endoplasmic
reticulum-associated protein found in various species including
humans, chimpanzees, rats, mice, and dogs where it acts as a
regulator of programmed cell death, mediating both autophagy and
apoptosis. Recently, studies have suggested that over-expression of
TMEM166 induces the autophagy process and may contribute to further
cellular dysfunction and activation of programmed cell death
(He et al., 2009). However, other studies have suggested a different
role for TMEM166, suggesting more neuroprotective properties.
Thus, further understanding of the TMEM166 protein may provide
new information about signaling pathways between the apoptosis

and autophagy processes and clarify whether it provides cellular protection
or propagates damage (Wang et al., 2007).
Beclin-1 (the homologue of the yeast Apg6/Vps30) participates in
the early stages of autophagy, promoting the nucleation of the autophagic
vesicle and recruiting proteins from the cytosol (Ferraro and
Cecconi, 2007), which is now used as a marker of final autophagosome
formation. In contrast to Beclin-1, LC3 (a mammalian homologue
of yeast Apg 8/Aut7) was the first protein identified from the
autophagosome membrane (Kabeya et al., 2000). There are three isoforms
of LC3 mRNA: LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C. After synthesis, LC3 is subsequently
processed to LC3-I (cytosolic form) and modified to the
active LC3-II form (membrane bound form) by posttranslational
modification. LC3-II, after conjugation and lipidation with phosphatidylethanolamine
, binds to the outer membrane of autophagosomes.
LC3 is another reliable marker of autophagosome formation in mammalian
cells, and the relative amount of LC3-II reflects autophagic
activity.
Accordingly, in the present study we investigated the role of the
TMEM166 protein following a middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) induced injury in rats — specifically evaluating whether
TMEM166 could orchestrate the induction of neuronal autophagy
and apoptosis following focal cerebral ischemia. In order to test
these aims, we used a TMEM166 siRNA protein and corresponding
results of mortality rate, brain edema accumulation, blood–brain-barrier
(BBB) disruption, and neurobehavioral deficits, and compared
them to those animals treated with the control siRNA. Additionally,
western blotting techniques were utilized to evaluate the expression
of key pro-autophagy and apoptotic proteins such as TMEM166,
Beclin-1, cleaved casepase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax.
Materials and methods
All protocols for this study were evaluated and approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee at Peking University Health Sciences
Center and with the Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience
Research by the Society for Neuroscience (Beijing, certificate
no. SCXK 2002-0001).
To verify the effect of TMEM166 siRNA, quantitative real-time PCR
assay was carried out in an ABI Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems, USA) with specific primers for TMEM166 and GAPDH
on hypoxia-induced forebrain cultured neurons from Sprague–Dawley
rat embryos.
Neuronal cell culture and exposure to hypoxia
Primary forebrain cultured neurons were obtained from fourteen
day old Sprague–Dawley rat embryos as previously described
(Lievre et al., 2000). Briefly, living embryos were excised by cesarean
section performed under anesthesia with halothane. Whole
embryos were placed in culture medium previously equilibrated
at 37 °C and consisting of a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (50:50, ICN Pharmaceuticals
, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% inactivated
fetal calf serum (Valbiotech, Paris, France). Forebrains were carefully
collected, meninges were dissected and gently dispersed in culture
medium. After centrifugation at 700×gfor 10 min, the pellet was
re-dispersed in the same medium and passed through a 46 mm-pore
size nylon mesh. The cell suspension was transferred into 35 mm
petri dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Le Pont-de-Claix, France)
pre-coated with poly-L-lysine. The final density was 106 cells per
dish. Cultures were then placed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
of 95% air/5% CO
2
.
Six day old neuronal cell cultures were committed to hypoxia for
6 h by transferring the culture dishes to a humidified incubation
chamber thermoregulated at 37 °C andflushed by a gas mixture consisting
of 95% N
2
/5% CO
2
. Cultures were then returned for the next
96 h to normoxic atmosphere, at 37 °C, whereas controls were constantly
maintained under standard conditions.
TMEM166 siRNAs synthesis
Specific siRNAs targeting against TMEM166 (targeting sequence
5-TGATAAGGATCTCTTGCCA-3; si-TMEM166) were designed and
chemically synthesized and PAGE purified according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Genechem Corporation, Shanghai, China). Nonsilencing
siRNA that had no sequence homology to any known
human genes was used as the control. All siRNAs were dissolved at
a concentration of 20 μm in buffer containing 20 mM KCl, 6 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM MgCl
2
.
Hypoxia induced forebrain neurons expressing TMEM166-GFP
were cultured on the coverslips, stained with either MAP-2 or GFAP
fluorescence immunohistochemical staining with Tracker Red for
15 min at 37 °C, and observed byfluorescence microscopy (detail description
see double and triple fluorescence labeling).
Real-time quantitative PCR
A quantitative real-time PCR assay was carried out in an ABI Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with specific
primers for TMEM166 and GAPDH. Preliminary reactions were run
to optimize the concentration and ratio of each primer set. All the
cDNA templates were diluted 100 times and 8 ll of each diluted
cDNA template was used in a 20 ll real-time PCR amplification system
of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Kit as the manufacturer directed. The
expression level of normal oxygen (no hypoxia) as control was treated
as the baseline.
Infection efficiency of siRNA in rat brain
To test if the siRNA could be successfully transfected into the neuronal
cells following intracerebroventricular injection, a fluorescence
conjugated siRNA (Santa Cruz; sc-36869) was used immediately after
MCAO in the pilot experiments (n=2). At 24 h after injection, the animals
were anesthetized and sacrificed by intracardiac perfusion of
ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain was removed, postfixed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS and embedded in Tissue
Tek. Cryostat sections (20μm) were collected on slides and observed
under afluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51) (Chen et al., 2009;
Hu et al., 2009).
Experimental groups and MCAO model
One hundred and fifty six male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
300–350 g were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle at a controlled
temperature and humidity with free access to food and water. A total
of 120 rats (36 died within 24 h) were randomly assigned to one of
four groups: Sham (n=30), MCAO (n=30), MCAO+control siRNA
(n=30) and MCAO+TMEM166 siRNA groups (n=30). Among the
groups, 6 animals were sacrificed for brain water content, 8 for western
blotting, 8 for histological examination, and 8 for Evan's blue content
examination. MCAO was induced by the endovascular suture rat
model as previously described by Chen et al. (2009) with some
added modifications. Briefly, animals were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane with a mixture of 60% medical air and 40% oxygen and anesthesia
was maintained with 2% isoflurane. The right common carotid,
internal carotid and external carotid arteries were surgically exposed.
The external carotid artery was then isolated and coagulated. A 4-
0 nylon suture with silicon (Doccol Co.) was inserted into the internal
carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump and gently advanced
to occlude the MCA.
The mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases, and
blood glucose levels before, during, and after ischemia were analyzed.

(TRIAL VER. PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1903508171)
Following 2 h of MCAO, the suture was carefully removed to restore
bloodflow, the neck incision was closed and the rats were allowed to recover.
The body (rectal) temperature at 37.0±0.58 °C was carefully
monitored by a feedback-controlled infrared heating pad during the
postoperative period until the animal had completely recovered from
the anesthesia. After the experiment, animals were housed individually
with free access to food and water until they were sacrificed.
Drug administration
TMEM166 siRNA (5μL; Santa Cruz; sc-94711) was diluted with
the same volume of transfection reagent. The mixture (10μL) was
injected intracerebroventricularly immediately after MCAO according
to the established protocol (Hu et al., 2009). In the control siRNA
group, rats were treated with the same volume of control siRNA
(Santa Cruz; sc-37007). The anesthetized animals were placed in a
stereotaxic apparatus and then the siRNA was injected into the right
lateral ventricle over 3 min using a Hamilton microsyringe (coordinates
0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the midline,
4.5 mm ventral to the surface of the skull).
Neurobehavioral deficits
Neurological outcomes were assessed by a blinded observer at
24 h post-MCAO using the Modified Garcia Score (Garcia et al.,
1995). The Modified Garcia Score is an 18-point sensorimotor assessment
system consisting of six tests with scores of 0–3 for each test
(max score=18). These seven tests included: (i) spontaneous activity
, (ii) side stroking, (iii) vibris touch, (iv) limb symmetry, (v) climbing
, (vi) forelimb walking.
Blood–brain-barrier permeability
BBB permeability was measured as previously reported (Uyama et
al., 1988). Briefly, Evan's blue dye (4%; 2.5 mL/kg) was injected intravenously
into the jugular vein and allowed to circulate for 1 h. This
was followed by perfusion with PBS (20 mL) via the aorta. The rats
were then decapitated, brains harvested and divided into right and
left hemispheres. Brain samples were homogenized in 600μL of PBS
and centrifuged (30 min, 15,000 rcf, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected
and equal amounts of 50% trichloroacetic acid were added followed
by another centrifuge (30 min, 15,000 rcf, 4 °C). The amount of
Evan's blue dye was measured by the spectrophotometer and quantified according to a standard curve (Genesis 10uv; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Brain water content
Brain water content was measured as previously described (Xi et
al., 2002). Briefly, animals were decapitated under deep anesthesia.
Brains were immediately removed and cut into four parts: both
ipsilateral and contralateral basal ganglia and cortex, cerebellum
and brain stem were collected as an internal control. Tissue samples
were weighed on an electronic analytical balance (APX-60, Denver
Instrument) to the nearest 0.1 mg to obtain the wet weight (WW).
The tissue was then dried at 100 °C for 24 h to determine the dry
weight (DW). Brain water content (%) was calculated as [(WW−
DW)/WW]×100.
TTC staining
2,3,7-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining for infarction
volume was conducted as previously described (Chen et al., 2009; Hu
et al., 2009). Briefly, at 24 h post-MCAO rats (sham group, n=8;
MCAO group, n=8; TMEM166 siRNA group, n=5; control siRNA,
n=5) were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and then decapitated.
Brains were then rapidly removed and sliced into 2-mm-thick coronal
sections in an adult rat brain matrix (Kent Scientific Corporation). The
slices were stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark (Chen et al., 2009). The infarction
area and hemisphere area of each section were traced and measured
using an image analysis system [Imaging-Pro-Plus (OLYMPUS)]. The
possible interferenceof brain edema to infarction volumewas corrected
by the following standard method: the non-infarcted area of the ipsilateral
hemisphere/total non-infarcted area (from both the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres).

Histology
Animals were sacrificed with deep anesthesia and perfused
through the left ventricles with 200 mL of ice-cold 0.1 mol/L PBS followed
by 400 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH 7.4).
Brains were post-fixed in the samefixative overnight. Followingfixation
, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for over 48 h at
4 °C. Coronal brain sections (20μm thick) were cut on a cryostat (Leica
CM3050 S). A series of sections was obtained from all animal groups.
Sections from each animal were divided into several groups for immunohistochemistry
and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The
results were observed under an Olympus BX51 microscope. TUNEL-
positive cell staining was also conducted as previously described and
was counted under microscopy (Chen et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2009).
Immunohistochemistry staining
Immunohistochemical staining was conducted as previously described
(Chen et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2009). Briefly,five series of sections
from each group animals were used for the following primary polyclonal
antibodies: (1) rabbit anti-TMEM166 (Santa Cruz Inc.); (2) goat anti-
Beclin-1; (3) rabbit anti-LC3 (Santa Cruz Inc.). Sections were treated
with a different species ABC Kit according to the species of antibodies
(Santa Cruz Inc.). Peroxidase activity was revealed by dipping the sections
for 5 min in a mixture containing 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
and H
2
O
2
at room temperature. The sections were dehydrated and
cover-slipped. Application of control serum, instead of the primary
antibody, on another section of the same brain provided a negative control
for each staining.
Double and triple fluorescence labeling
Double and triple fluorescence labeling were conducted as previously
described (Zhou et al., 2005). For double labeling, brain coronal
sections from MCAO group rats were incubated by primary antibodies
rabbit anti-TMEM166 and goat anti-Beclin-1 (1:200) overnight at
4 °C. The sections were treated with second antibodies conjugated
with fluorescence dyes: goat anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red 1:200 (Santa
Cruz Inc.), and donkey anti-goat IgG-AMCA (blue aminomethylcoumarin
acetate) 1:200 (Jackson Immuno Research Inc., Pennsylvania,
USA) in the dark for 2 h at room temperature respectively. For triple
labeling, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) fluorescence staining (green, fluorescein dUTP and
dNTP Kit, Roche Inc., protocol) was added to double fluorescence labeling.
Sections were covered with 30% glycerin and observed under
fluorescent microscope operating with a digital camera (Olympus,
BX51). Digitalized microphotographs of immunofluorescent sections
were saved. The merged images were generated by the Image Pro-
Plus software.
Western blotting
Two series brain infarction samples were prepared for western
blotting. One series contained 6 time groups of focal ischemia

(sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 h, and 7 days); another series contained
4 experimental groups (Sham, MCAO, control siRNA and TMEM166-
siRNA). Samples (50μg protein; Bradford dye-binding procedure,
BioRad Laboratories) were separated onto SDS-polyacrylamide membrane
as previously described (Chen et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2009), and
probed with the anti-TMEM166 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Inc.);
anti-Beclin-1 antibody (1:1000, monoclonal; BD Transduction Laboratories
, Lexington, KY), anti-cleaved casepase-3 (1:500 monoclonal,
1:1000, polyclonal, respectively; BD Transduction Laboratories,
Lexington, KY), anti-Bax (1:1000, mouse polyclonal, Santa Cruz Inc.)
and anti-Bcl-2 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Inc.). A monoclonal
antibody against β-actin (1:4000, Sigma) was used as a control
for protein gel loading. Immunoblots were then probed with an ECL
Plus chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington
Heights, IL) and visualized with the imagine system (Bio-Rad, Versa
Doc, model 4000). The data were analyzed by the software Image J.
Data analysis
The statistical differences between two groups were analyzed
using the established t-test. Multiple comparisons were statistically
analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey multiple comparison post-hoc analysis or Student–Newman–
Keuls test on ranks. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
TMEM166 siRNA reduced TMEM166 mRNA levels
In order to effectively determine the specificity of the TMEM166
siRNA translation, siRNA was used to silence the expression of
TMEM166 in hypoxic cultured rat forebrain neurons. Both nonsilencing
siRNA and TMEM166 siRNA (si-TMEM166) were transfected
into neurons combined with the TMEM166-GFP vector. At 48 h after
transfection, TMEM166 mRNA and protein levels were significantly
reduced in cells transfected with si-TMEM166, as assessed by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR (Figs. 1A, B) and fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 1C).
Twenty four hours following intracerebroventricular injection of
control siRNA, the fluorescence material was observed in the brain
parenchyma (Fig. 2A1). The double fluorescence immunohistochemical
staining showed the siRNA-GFP was co-labeled with MAP-2
(Fig. 2A2) and GFAP (Fig. 2A3). It indicated that injected siRNA successfully
transfected into the neurons (marked by MAP-2) and astrocytes
(marked by GFAP).
Western blotting analysis revealed decreased expression of TMEM166
following injury
The expression of TMEM166 from brain infarction in different
times was shown by western blot analysis of TMEM166 expression
at 6, 12, 24, 48,96 h, and 7 days following MCAO (Fig. 2B). The expression
of the TMEM166 protein slightly increased as early as 6 h following
MCAO, augmented significantly at 12 h, and increased to the
highest level at 24 h, then reduced continuously at both 48 and 96 h
(pb0.05) until no significant difference was seen by 7 days (pb0.05;
Fig. 2B).
TMEM166 siRNA reduced mortality rates and neurobehavioral deficits
following MCAO injury
Twenty four hours following MCAO injury, approximately 36 rats
(total number started with 156 rats) died at 24 h (Fig. 3A). With
regard to mortality, they were found to be: MCAO group 34.78%
(16/46 rats), control siRNA 33.33% (15/45 rats), TMEM166 siRNA
14.28% (5/35 rats), and 0% (0/30 rats) in the sham group. Statistical
analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in mortality
between the MCAO, control siRNA groups and TMEM166 siRNA
group (p=0.030, p=0.020, respectively). However, no statistical
significance in mortality rate was observed between the MCAO and
MCAO+control siRNA group.
The mean neurobehavioral scores were shown in Fig. 3B. No deficits
were observed among sham operated animals; however, there
was a marked decline in the MCAO and control siRNA groups. The
TMEM166 siRNA showed a statistically significant improvement (i.e.
reduction) in neurobehavioral deficits when compared to MCAO
and control siRNA groups at 24 h (pb0.05).
TMEM166 siRNA reduced infarction volume following focal brain ischemia
Twenty four hours following MCAO injury, rat brains were evaluated
for infarction volume using TTC staining and specific imaging
software. Representative samples of TTC-stained brain sections were
shown in Fig. 4A with corresponding infarction volumes shown in
Fig. 4B. We observed a significant increase in infarction volume in
the MCAO group compared to the non-operated sham group (28±
5% vs 48±6%, pb0.05) and the control siRNA group (26.0±3%).
This was in contrast to the TMEM166 siRNA group which showed a
marked reduction in infarction volume compared to both the MCAO
and control siRNA groups (41±5%, pb0.05 vs MCAO and control
siRNA respectively).

TMEM166 siRNA reduced BBB disruption and brain edema
BBB permeability was measured using the Evan's blue assay technique
(Figs. 5A, B). Compared with the sham operated animal group,
MCAO and control siRNA groups demonstrated a marked extravasation
of Evan's blue dye in both hemispheres at 24 h (pb0.05) —especially
in the brain stem and cerebellum (pb0.01). Treatment with
TMEM166 siRNA significantly reduced the amount of Evan's blue extravasations
in both hemispheres (pb0.05 vs MCAO and control siRNA).
Brain water content was shown in Fig. 5C. There were no significant
differences observed among the groups for the contralateral
hemisphere, brain stem and cerebellum water content for
TMEM166 siRNA vs MCAO and control siRNA. Compared to sham operated
animals, there was a significant increase in brain water content
in ipsilateral hemisphere in both the MCAO and control siRNA groups
at 24 h post-MCAO injury (pb0.05). Subsequent treatment with
TMEM166 siRNA showed a statistically significant reduction in brain
water content (pb0.05).

TMEM166 siRNA significantly reduced the autophagic activity
Immunohistochemical staining showed increased expressions of
TMEM166, Beclin-1 and LC3 in infarcted regions at 24 h following
MCAO (Figs. 6A1–A4) as well as in control siRNA group (Figs. 6B1–B4)
— they were negative in sham animals (images are not presented).
The TMEM166 siRNA reduced the expressions of TMEM166, Beclin-1
and LC3 in the penumbral areas of infarcted brain in both the MCAO
and control siRNA animal groups (Figs. 6C1–C4). Western blotting
analysis of brain tissue sample from infarcted areas demonstrated an
increased expressions of TMEM166 and Beclin-1 in the MCAO and
control siRNA groups compared with those of sham operated animals
(Figs. 7A,B. pb0.05). Following administration of TMEM166 siRNA, the
levels of TMEM166 and Beclin-1 were significantly decreased (pb0.05).
TMEM166 siRNA reduced apoptotic activity
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) was a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation
that results from apoptotic signaling cascades. Strong TUNEL positive
cellular nuclei were observed in the penumbra of brain infarction in
MCAO and control siRNA animals (Figs. 6A5, B5). In rats treated
with TMEM166 siRNA, the number and density of TUNEL staining
were also decreased (Fig. 6C5). Following western blotting analysis,

the levels of cleaved casepase-3 expression were significantly increased
in both the MCAO and control-siRNA groups compared to
sham animals (pb0.05; Fig. 7C). The increased expression was then
significantly reduced following TMEM166 siRNA administration
(pb0.05 vs MCAO and control siRNA).
Doublefluorescence staining revealed a relationship expression between
autophagy and apoptosis
Doublefluorescence immunohistochemistry labeling showed both
TMEM166 (positive in red; Fig. 6D1) and Beclin-1 (positive in blue;
Fig. 6D2) were found within the same neurons (Fig. 6D3). Further
staining with TUNEL (green, Fig. 6D4), demonstrated that the signals
of TMEM166, Beclin-1 and TUNEL were also in the same neurons
(Fig. 6D5). In Fig. 7, western blotting analysis revealed the levels of
Bax expression in the MCAO and control siRNA groups were significantly
higher than that of the sham animals. Additionally, Bcl-2 expression
in the MCAO and control siRNA groups was significantly
lower than that of the sham group (pb0.05, Fig. 7D); moreover,
TMEM166 siRNA not only reduced the expression of Bax, but also increased
the expression of Bcl-2 (pb0.05, Fig. 7D).
Discussion
The present study was designed to investigate the role of transmembrane
protein 166 (TMEM166) following MCAO injury in rats —specifically
investigating whether TMEM166 could orchestrate the induction
of cell autophagy and apoptosis in this type of injury. Our experiments
found that following brain injury there was a significant increase
in mortality rate, brain edema accumulation, and neurobehavioral
deficits in our rat population; and that following administration of
TMEM166 siRNA, there was remarkable reduction. Additionally, further
investigation revealed a significant reduction in brain infarction volume
following TMEM166 siRNA administration, while both immunohistochemical
and western blotting analysis demonstrated the involvement
of key pro-autophagic and apoptotic related proteins. Accordingly,
these results suggest that TMEM166 is a key orchestrator of autophagic
and apoptotic functions following MCAO injury in rats and that through
its modulation, we could preserve the structural integrity of the BBB,
translating into functional preservation of our rat population.
All three modes of cellular death – necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy – have been seen following cerebral ischemic injury (Lipton,
1999). Whereas the role of necrosis and apoptosis has been clearly
defined, the precise role of autophagy still remains to be elucidated.
This is in part because of the mixed literature that has published
both its harmful and protective potentials. On one hand researchers
have shown that autophagy plays a key role in cellular survival pathways
in response to nutrient deprivation as well as various disease
processes including Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease
(Levine and Yuan, 2005). Yet on the other hand, studies investigating
cellular death following neonatal hypoxia–ischemia have
shown a more neuroprotective role (Carloni et al., 2008). As a result,
it was important for us to investigate what role and in what capacity
the autophagic process had among subjects injured by focal brain ischemia.
This would allow us to better understand potential upstream
targets that can be blocked to reduce downstream consequences following
brain injury, i.e. brain edema, BBB disruption, neurobehavioral
deficits.
Autophagy, also known as cellular self-digestion, is a dynamic intracellular
process responsible for degrading cytoplasmic proteins

and organelles in response to external stressors (Kondo et al., 2005;
Maiuri et al., 2007b). To date, a number of complicated signaling pathways
have been implicated in the regulation of autophagy — one of
which is TMEM166, also known as FLJ13391. TMEM166 is a novel lysosomal
and endoplasmic reticulum associated membrane protein that
contains a putative transmembrane domain. As a novel regulator involved
in both autophagy and apoptosis (Wang et al., 2007), our results
suggest for the first time that TMEM166 can also be a regulator
for both autophagy and apoptosis following MCAO injury. This is important
because cellular death leads to a variety of complications including
the accumulation of brain edema which causes a rise in
intracranial pressure, a reduction in cerebral blood flow causing further
ischemic damage — including neuronal cell death and long term
neurobehavioral impairment. Accordingly, in the current study, we
found that by blocking the TMEM166 with siRNA, we could subsequently
reduce brain edema and improve BBB disruption following
MCAO injury. This preservation of structural integrity translated into
improvements in neurobehavioral capabilities as well.
The initial step of the autophagy pathway is the elongation of isolated
membranes surrounding cytoplasmic constituents called autophagosomes.
Subsequently, the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes,
generating the single membraned autophagolysosome whose contents
are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (Yoshimori, 2004).
Autophagy that occurs in ischemic stroke involves the rearrangement
of subcellular membranes into autophagosomes and autophagic vacuoles
(Klionsky and Emr, 2000). Similarly, in the current study we
found that high levels of TMEM166 lead to massive lysosomal activation
and ultimately cell demise following MCAO injury (Figs. 6 and 7).
Previously it was reported that hypoxic–ischemic neuronal death was
largely prevented by Atg7 deficiency (Uchiyama et al., 2008a) and
Beclin-1siRNA (Zheng et al., 2009) — we found that once TMEM166
was inhibited by siRNA, the expressions of Beclin-1 and LC3 were attenuated
, suggesting that TMEM166 mediated the autophagic cell
death pathway through Beclin-1 and LC3 following MCAO injury.
The crosstalk between ‘self-eating’ (autophagy) and ‘self-killing’
(apoptosis) remains unclear, even though the involvement of a functional
and physical Bec1/Bcl-2 interaction has been suggested (Maiuri
et al., 2007a). A novel protein, NAF-1 (nutrient-deprivation autophagy
factor-1), that binds Bcl-2 at the ER. NAF-1 is a component of the
inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) receptor complex, which contributes
to the interaction of Bcl-2 with Bec1and is required for Bcl-2 to functionally
antagonize Bec1-mediated autophagy (Chang et al., 2010).
Apoptosis and autophagy can occur concurrently within damaged
neurons, leading to cell death. In the current study, in order to confirm
whether TMEM166 mediated apoptosis and autophagy following
MCAO injury, TMEM166, Beclin-1 and LC3 immunohistochemistry
and TUNEL labeling were performed. The positive results (Fig. 6) suggested
that autophagy and apoptosis occurred somehow as a

consequence of TMEM166 activation. This was also confirmed by
western blotting which showed a significant reduction in Beclin-1
and cleaved casepase-3 following TMEM166 siRNA administration
compared to MCAO or MCAO+control siRNA groups (Figs. 7B,C). Further
evaluation using TTC infarction volume assay and neurobehavioral
deficits observation also confirmed the TMEM166 functions.
Thus to this point we can conclude that autophagy and apoptosis cell
death may be orchestrated through TMEM166 and that its inhibition
can reduce the cell loss following ischemia.
TMEM166 is an essential mediator of cell death and plays a key functional
role in the process of autophagy and apoptosis (Wang et al.,
2007). Like Beclin-1 and Virtual Mono Poly Analogue Synthesizer
(VMP1, TMEM49) proteins, TMEM166 binds to and neutralizes prosurvival
members of the Bcl-2 family to promote apoptosis (Ferraro and
Cecconi, 2007). Proteins from Bcl-2 family not only participate in the
regulation of apoptosis, but are also important inducers or inhibitors
of autophagy (Levine et al., 2008). Along with Beclin-1, TMEM166
may also be another avenue of cross-talk between the apoptotic and
autophagic pathway (Liu et al., 2010; Maiuri et al., 2007b; Wang et al.,
2007). Generally, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) or the Bcl-2 homologue
B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) complex is formed by the combination
of a the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) domain in Beclin-1 and
the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL (Liu et al., 2010). Under specific
stimuli, BH3-only proteins likeBad can competitively antagonizethe interaction
between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL. As a result, BH3-only proteins
may differentially induce autophagy and apoptosis by acting on
(at least) two distinct subcellular compartments (Maiuri et al., 2007a;
Oltersdorf et al., 2005). In our study, we found that the level of Bcl-2/
Bax significantly changed in MCAO and TMEM166 siRNA groups
(Fig. 7D). It is our belief that TMEM166 could also mediate cell autophagy
and apoptosis through the Bcl-2 family.
In conclusion, this study suggests that TMEM166 induced autophagy
and apoptosis may in fact play a significant role in the cell
death process following MCAO injury and its mediation may be
through the Bcl-2. By blocking the activity of TMEM166 using
siRNA, we were able to improve outcomes that occured following
MCAO injury. This preservation of structural integrity translated into
a preservation of functional capabilities and an improvement in
mortality. That being said, more studies evaluating the exact mechanistic
relationship between autophagy and apoptosis and its molecular
pathway are warranted.
