Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a chronically proceeding pathology of small brain vessels associated with
white matter lesions, lacunar infarcts, brain atrophy and microbleeds. CSVD leads to slowly increasing cognitive
and functional deficits but may also cause stroke-like symptoms, if vessels in critical brain areas are affected.
Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) exhibit several vascular risk factors, develop infarcts
and hemorrhages and therefore represent a relevant model for the study of CSVD. Using this animal model,
we recently demonstrated that intravasal accumulations of erythrocytes, we interpreted as stases, stand at the
beginning of a pathological vascular cascade. After stases microbleeds occur, which are followed by reactive
microthromboses. Bleeds and thromboses finally cause hemorrhagic infarcts. Immunohistochemical stainings
show, that plasma proteins like IgG are deposited in the walls of vessels affected by stases. Further, we found
small clots and thread-shaped aggregations of thrombocytes as well as thread-shaped structures of von
Willebrand-Factor within stases. Thus, we conclude that blood–brain barrier damages occur in the neighborhood
of stases and stases seem to be associated with a restricted activation of blood coagulation without formation of
obstructive thromboses. Finally, we demonstrate that small vessel damage rarely appears in the cerebellum.
Even animals with multiple cerebral infarcts may be free of any cerebellar vascular pathology.

1. Introduction
Human cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is not only associated
with acute cerebral ischemia [1] but has also been recognized as one
major etiology of vascular dementia [2]. Human CSVD is associated
with some well established imaging features (including white matter lesions
, lacunar infarcts, brain atrophy and microbleeds/microhemorrhages
[3]), whereas its underlying histology has been sparsely described systematically [4–6]. The main histopathological findings related to the
white matter and basal ganglia's small arteries include “disorganized arterial
lesions” (in part with deposits of fibrinoid material and local enlargement
of the vessel), concentric hyaline vessel wall thickening with
concomitant luminal narrowing (in part caused by plasma protein leakage
into the vessel wall), enlarged perivascular spaces, aneurysm formation
implying a dilatation of the vessel lumen and extravasations of blood
(partially through a damaged vessel wall) [4–6].
In a former study we aimed to identify, whether the vascular histopathology
associated with CSVD proceeds in definite stages. By
means of serial histological investigations of spontaneously hypertensive
stroke-prone rats (SHRSP)–an animal model accepted as potentially
relevant to the study of CSVD[7,8] –we were able to describe a
chronology of definite pathological stages of the cerebral small vessel
disease[9]. Thereby our results demonstrate that the vascular pathology
in SHRSP is initiated by an accumulation of erythrocytes in capillary
and arteriolar segments of different brain regions [9]. We parsimoniously
interpreted those accumulated erythrocytes as stases. Meanwhile
we have examined the etiology of the erythrocyte accumulations more
closely; thereby our further data support the relevance of stases for the
initial phase of CSVD. Moreover we were interested in the correlation
between the vascular histopathology in the cerebrum and the cerebellum.
Our results reveal that the cerebellum is rarely affected by small
vessel changes.

n=6, 14 w n=5, 16 w n=3, 18 w n=4, 20 w n=2, 22 w n=2,
24 w n=5, 26 w n=3, 28 w n=11, 30 to 32 w n=15, 34 w n=2,
36 w n=15, 40 w n=12, 41 to 42 w n=3, 44 w n=6). Thirty seven
Wistar rats at corresponding ages served as control group (12 w n=4,
18 w n=4, 26 w n=4, 32 w n=5, 36 w n=7, 40 w n=6, 65 w
n=2, 2 years [a] n=3, 3 a n=2). Rats were transcardially perfused
with 120 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 120 ml 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) within 4 min. Brains were removed, stored
in 4% PFA for 48 h, placed for cryoprotection into 30% sacharose for
6 days, and frozen in methylbutane at−80 °C. Coronal slices (30 μm)
of the whole brain were prepared with a cryotoma (Leica, Nussloch,
Germany) and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (HE) (for details see
[9]). All brains of SHRSP and controls were investigated for the occurrence
of vessels with accumulated erythrocytes, microbleeds and
microthromboses in the basal ganglia, cortical regions, corpus callosum,
and hippocampus[9]. For the cerebellum a sample of brains (32 SHRSP,
11 controls) was examined. Brain slices were immunohistochemically
stained with STL (Solanum Tuberosum Lectin, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, USA, 1:500; binds on glycoproteins on the surface of endothelium
cells [10]), anti-von Willebrand-Factor (vWF) (abcam,
1:200) and a thrombocyte antibody (Fitzgerald Industries International
, 1:1000). Slices were washed anew before application of
anti-rat-IgG-Cy3 or anti-rabbit-IgG-Cy3 for 2 h at room temperature
andsubsequentDAPI-staining. As a controlfirst antibodies were omitted
during immunohistochemistry staining. Cy3-donkey-anti-rat-IgG was
used for detection of IgG and Cy3-donkey-anti-rabbit-Cy3 was used as
secondary antibody for anti-vWF- and anti-thrombocyte-antibody. IgG
was examined in 9 SHRSP (18 w n=1, 24 w n=1, 28 w n=2, 32 w
n=2, 34 w n=1, 36 w n=2) vWF in 12 SHRSP (20 w n=1, 22 w
n=1, 24 w n=1, 28 w n=3, 32 w n=1, 34 w n=1, 36 w n=2,
40 w n=1, 42 w n=1) and 2 controls ( 26 w n=1, 2 a n=1), thrombocytes
in 2 SHRSP (28 w n=1, 34 w n=1) and1 control (26 w n=1).
2.1. Chronological progress of the vascular histopathology in SHRSP
As recently reported, we see an age-dependent cascade of vascular
changes in SHRSP[9]. Thefirst detectable changes are intravasal accumulations
of erythrocytes, which we refer to as stases. Starting from
an age of 28 weeks virtually all investigated SHRSP show such stases.
The stases primarily occur in capillaries (Fig. 1A), but can be found
later on also in arterioles (Fig. 1B and C). A comparison of 28 week
old SHRSP with animals aged 12 weeks reveals that single stases become
bigger in their extension occur more frequently in arterioles
(Fig. 1B and C) and the number of stases per animal increases dramatically [9]. Arterioles with stases frequently show enlarged perivascular
spaces (Fig. 1C). Microbleeds (Fig. 1D) which may occur
according to our last data already at an age of 24 weeks most likely
initiate the actual infarct state. Microthromboses obviously develop
as a reaction to these microbleeds. Therefore small vessel occlusions
are frequently seen to be surrounded by fresh and older hemorrhages
(Fig. 1E and F). Both, hemorrhages and small vessel occlusions are located
in infarct regions of SHRSP aged 32 weeks or older. The resultant
necrosis and spongiform tissue damage represent the terminal
stage of the pathological cascade (Fig. 1E and F).
In the control group we also found intravasal erythrocyte accumulations
, which could be hardly detected due to their overall low number
per brain, their restricted extent and their predominant occurrence in
capillaries. Moreover, significantly fewer animals (54%, 20 of 37) were
affected compared to the SHRSP group (91%, 86 of 94). None of the controls
exhibited hemorrhages or infarctions.
2.2. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage and thrombocyte aggregation in
the vicinity of stases
Stases are visibly after immunohistochemical staining by the frequently
occurring autofluorescence of the erythrocytes (Fig. 2).
Fig. 1.Pathological cascade of the cerebral small vessel disease in SHRSP. Accumulations of erythrocytes in capillaries (A) and arterioles (B), we referred to as stases, represent the
first step (A–C). Note the enlarged perivascular space in C. Later on microbleeds occur (D) which obviously initiate the phase of infarcts illustrated in E and F. Most likely, small
vessel occlusions (asterisk; F) develop as a consequence of bleedings (arrows; F). Both, microbleeds and microthromboses cause the ischemic damage visible as spongy like tissue
destructions (E). Panel F is a higher magnification of E.

Through this, it is possible to investigate changes of the vessel wall
in the vicinity of stases. Recently, we demonstrated early forms of
a compromised BBB in SHRSP by IgG deposits in the vessel wall [9].
Fig. 2A (arrow) demonstrates an IgG deposit in the direct vicinity
of a stasis. Furthermore, single thrombocyte clots (Fig. 2C, arrow)
or aggregations of thrombocytes can be detected within stases.
Thrombocytes sometimes appear as filamentary platelet aggregationsasshowninFig. 2Borassmallclots( Fig. 2C). Moreover, we
detected stases which are associated with filamentary configured
vWF (Fig. 2D). The filamentary one is the activated configuration
of vWF, which is able to stick to damaged endothelium regions and
effectively binds thrombocytes.
2.3. Cerebellum is almost devoid of small vessel disease
We investigated 32 SHRSP and 11 control rats for the existence of
vascular changes in the cerebellum. In only 8 SHRSP (25%) we found
stases in the cerebellum, whereas all control animals were free of any
cerebellar vascular peculiarities. There is a pronounced discrepancy between
cerebrum and cerebellum regarding any kind of vascular damage.
The sole vascular damage we found in the cerebellum was stases. There
were no cerebellar hemorrhages or infarcts with small vessel occlusions.
In contrast, all investigated SHRSP contained stases in their cerebrum, 6
of them additionally showed microbleeds and two SHRSP were additionally
affected by infarcts with small vessel occlusions (Table 1).
Among the 6 SHRSP with severe vascular damages (hemorrhages
or infarcts) in the cerebrum we only found one animal exhibiting
stases in the cerebellum (A214; Table 1; Fig. 3C and D). And only 7
out of 26 SHRSP with stases in the cerebrum showed stases also in
the cerebellum (Table 1). Both SHRSP with multiple infarcts in the cerebrum
(A202 and A210) were free of vascular damages in the cerebellum
(Table 1; Fig. 3E and F). Fig. 3 shows two exemplary SHRSP
with stases in the cerebrum. One of them had also stases in the cerebellum
(Fig. 3C and D).
3. Discussion
The common (macroangiopathic) stroke is caused by either thrombotic
or embolic infarcts due to an occlusion of cerebral arteries or by
vascular rupture leading to cerebral hemorrhage In contrast CSVD is
characterized by pathological changes in a multitude of small vessels.
Therefore, clinical symptoms in patients range from rather subtle cognitive
, sensory and motoric deficits to acute stroke-like symptoms. The
latter appear, if vascular events like hemorrhages and thromboses
take place in small vessels supplying so called strategic brain areas.
However, the precise pathology ongoing in the small vessels is not
well understood.
SHRSP display a similar risk profile as patients with CSVD, including
arterial hypertension, insulin resistance and mixed hyperlipidemia[11].
These rats therefore provide a suitable animal model which may reflect
critical hallmarks also typical for the human CSVD. Investigating the
temporal development of vascular damage we were recently able to
infer a model for the pathological vascular cascade of CSVD ongoing in
these rats with increasing age (Fig.4).
Fig. 2.Blood–brain barrier damage, thrombocyte aggregation and activated vWF. Erythrocytes in stases are visualized by autofluorescence in different colors. In panel A deposits of
IgG (arrow) in the vessel wall are located in vicinity to a stasis (purple). Panel B shows filamentary aggregations of thrombocytes enmeshed in a stasis (erythrocyte autofluorescence
in green). (C) Stasis in a capillary (arrow), emerging from an arteriole (arrowheads), contains aggregations of single thrombocyte clots. Note, that the arteriole also contains
smaller and bigger platelet aggregations (arrowheads; C). Sometimes elongated filaments of vWF are associated with stases (arrows; D). That filamentary, activated state of vWF
interacts with thrombocytes. Thrombo-thrombocytes; vessels are stained by the lectin STL.

Intravasal accumulations of erythrocytes, we referred to as stases,
are the first visible histological changes ([9]; Fig. 1). These stases already
appear in more than half of the SHRSP rats aged 12 weeks.
However, those stases are rather small, their number per animal is
still low and they are located only in capillaries. After 28 weeks the
histological picture has been changed dramatically. At this age, de
facto all animals are affected by those erythrocyte accumulations
and both, the dimension of stases as well as their number per animal
have been clearly increased. Now, stases are not only located in capillaries
but also in arterioles (Fig. 1B and C).
According to our model, microbleeds (Fig. 1D) initiate the phase of
the virtual infarcts. Further, we assume that microthromboses develop
in reaction to these microhemorrhages. This is supported by the
fact that the small vessel occlusions are always surrounded by fresh
and older hemorrhages (Fig. 1E and F). Both, microbleeds as well as
small vessel occlusions cause infarcts, which can be recognized as
spongy like tissue necrosis (Fig. 1E and F).
The increased size and number of stases at an age of 28 weeks
compared with 12 week old SHRSP is a strong indication that stases
are indeed associated with changes of cerebral small vessels. Therefore
, the question arose whether certain vessel wall changes occur
in the direct vicinity of stases. Already in our last study we demonstrated
IgG deposits in the vessel wall and single diapedeses of erythrocytes
into the parenchyma in SHRSP with stases [9].
Both phenomena are clear indications of a compromised BBB. Now,
we demonstrate IgG accumulations in the vicinity of stases (Fig. 2A).
Consequently, stases seem to beassociated withdeposits of plasma proteins
in the vessel wall. In this context, we have shown that plasma proteins
like IgG are settled beneath the endothelium layer[9]. This clearly
leads to BBB damage and it can be assumed that microbleeds may develop
right on this site.
Additionally we found aggregations of thrombocytes within stases
(Fig. 2B and C). These aggregations can appear asfilamentary structures
(Fig. 2B) or clots (Fig. 2C). Both, the presence of small clots as well as the
appearance of vWF asfilamentary structures, indicate the activation of
blood coagulation. This is obviously only a partial and not complete coagulation
but ourdata suggestthatthis occurs in directvicinityof stases.
However, the question remains whether stases cause a restricted aggregation
of thrombocytes or whether small clots together with other factors
promote the formation of stases.
So far, we have no data showing that obstructive clots are formed
either within or in the direct vicinity of stases. The BBB damages,

already mentioned earlier, occur in the direct vicinity of stases. Again,
this favors the assumption, that stases mark blood vessel regions, at
which wall ruptures and consequently microbleeds develop later
on. This is further supported by our observation, that stases are strikingly
not detectable in the neighborhood of (micro)hemorrhages.
Based on all these data, we inferred our model showing that CSVD
in SHRSP has an age-dependent course with stases at the beginning
and finally developing via microbleeds to microthromboses [9].
Interestingly, Prof. de Reuck from Lille reported on the conference
about microscopically small cerebral bleedings (micro- and minibleeds)
in patients with neurodegenerative dementia and healthy controls[12],
which strikingly resemble in their structure our hemorrhages in SHRSP.
Also, the enlarged perivascular space we found in arterioles with stases
of SHRSP (Fig. 1C) are described in human CSVD[4,5].
Despite our new data that we have been able to collect in this
study, the proper reason for the development of stases remains unknown.
It is however reasonable to assume that various factors play
together a critical role, including flow characteristics of the blood,
local injuries of the endothelium and arterial hypertension. To this
list one should certainly add striking vessel constrictions we found
in arterioles nearby to stases [9]. This phenomenon most likely reflects regulation disturbances of the cerebral vascular tonus.
From a technical point of view one cannot exclude certain variability
in the effectiveness of transcardial perfusion of animals. This might
also result in some retaining residual blood in few small vessels after
fixation. However, a great number of facts argue for the interpretation
that post mortem detected stases primarily result from pathological
changes in cerebral small vessels: the dramatic difference between
control rats and SHRSP (i); the significant increase of stases at a certain
age of SHRSP (ii); the occurrence of stases in certain arterioles
with left open surrounding capillaries making a perfusion failure
very unlikely (iii); stases were found to be associated with early
signs of BBB damage including depositions of plasma proteins, diapedesis
of single erythrocytes into the parenchyma and node like constrictions
of arterioles [9] (iv) and finally brain regions surrounding
microbleeds were always free of stases indicating a possible genesis
of bleedings on sites with antecedent stasis (v).
Nevertheless, the illustration of stases in the living animal remains
the great challenge for the future. But even without having these data
it becomes obvious, that stases, which we have been able to describe
so far only post mortem, are highly relevant for the pathogenesis of
CSVD in SHRSP.
Recently, we performed a systematical comparison between brain
and kidney from the same SHRSP animals. In that study we could

and infarctions (E) the cerebellum (right panels) is often free of any vascular damage (E and F). Panels C and D represent an animal with stases in both, cerebrum and cerebellum. In
B, D and F the cerebellar cortical layers are perceptible: superficial molecular layer with inhibitory neurons and Purkinje cellfibers (asterisk; B), stratum ganglionare/Purkinje layer
with Purkinje cells (arrow; B), deep granular layer with granule cells (arrowhead; B). Adjacent located is the white matter (circle; B). A capillary cerebellar stasis in the molecular
layer is highlighted by higher magnification in D. Scale bar 100 μm.

impressively confirm the general hypothesis, that CSVD is part of a
systemic small vessel disease [13,14]. We demonstrated that renal
vascular changes and the associated structural damage in the kidney
precede the cerebral vascular changes. Interestingly, we found stases
in peritubular capillaries to be one of the leading early findings of
structural damage in the kidney. Besides that it became clear, that
the grade of vascular damage develops in both organs in parallel
and proceeds age-dependently[13]. Interestingly, the sole control animal
(out of 37 investigated) with a comparable extent of stases as
found in 28 week old SHRSP also displayed kidney pathology. Obviously
this control animal, already 40 weeks old, was also suffering
from a systemic small vessel disease.
In the present study we were also interested in possible vascular
damage of the cerebellum. Alike in humans [15,16] the cerebellum of
SHRSP appears to be rarely affected by small vessel changes. Even in
some animals with multiple infarcts in the cerebrum we could not detect
any vascular peculiarities in the cerebellum (Fig. 3EandF).Ifat
all, vascular changes in the cerebellum were limited to stases small in
both, size and number (Fig. 3D).
In summary we have collected new data showing that stases are
associated with the aggregation of thrombocytes and also with a
compromised BBB. This underlines the high relevance of stases for
the initial phase of cerebral small vessel damage in SHRSP. The main
challenge for the future is the illustration of stases in a living animal.
