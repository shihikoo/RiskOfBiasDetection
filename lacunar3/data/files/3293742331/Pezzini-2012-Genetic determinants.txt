Stroke is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder. Although epidemiological data from twin and family studies
provide substantial evidence for a genetic basis for stroke, the contribution of genetic factors identified so
far is small. Large progress has been made in single-gene disorders associated with ischemic stroke, particularly
at young age. The identification of NOTCH3 mutations in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and of TREX1mutations in retinal
vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) have led to new insights on lacunar stroke and smallvessel
disease. Studies of sickle-cell disease have drawn attention to the importance of modifier genes and
of gene–gene interactions in determining stroke risk, while there is now evidence that Fabry disease is an
underdiagnosed cause of stroke. Furthermore, stroke is a well-known complication of several heritable connective
tissue disorders, including Marfan's syndrome (FBN1mutations) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV
(COL3A1 mutations), which predispose to cervical artery dissection, the most frequent cause of cerebral ischemia
at young age. By contrast, little is known about the genes associated with multifactorial stroke. The
reported genome-wide association studies of ischemic stroke have shown that no single common genetic
variant imparts major risk. Pharmacogenomic studies have uncovered genetic determinants of response to
warfarin, statins and clopidogrel. Larger studies with samples numbering in the thousands are ongoing to
identify common variants with smaller effects on risk. This approach will contribute to the identification of
additional genes, novel pathways, and eventually novel therapeutic approaches to cerebrovascular disorders.

Introduction
Stroke is a major public health issue because of its frequency, the
risk of death as well as residual physical, cognitive or behavioral
changes, and the risk of recurrent vascular events, either cardiac or
cerebral. Although the mean age of stroke occurrence is 75 years in
western countries and young adults are at low risk, cases occurring
at young age have a profound social impact because of the indirect
costs due to the long period of lost productivity.
Most strokes occurring at young age are ischemic in origin. Epidemiologic
data depend on the definition of “young”.Todefine an age cut-off in
any medical context is challenging, and perhaps arbitrary. It is probably
for this reason that different ages are included in the various published
registries, making comparison difficult. Three upper thresholds can be

attempt is made to place a limit at an age prior to which conventional vascular
disease is rare, and thus the rarer causes of stroke and those associated
with younger age are represented as a greater proportion. As
incidence is age-related, the trade off for having a lower cut-off is fewer
strokes and smaller series. The most frequently used upper age limit,
45 years, is a good compromise between an age-category where common
causes of cerebral ischemia are very rare, and a disorderthat is quite frequent
in specialised centres (2 to 12% of all strokes) [1]. The incidence of
ischemic stroke in young people ranges between 60 and 200 new cases
per year per million inhabitants, depending on the characteristics of the
population, increases exponentially with age, and is higher in nonindustrialised
countries and in black populations. The overall incidence
is about one episode per 10,000 patients per year. A hospital serving a typical
western population of 500,000 inhabitants, for example, would have
about 233,000 adults of 49 years or younger, and thus may expect to
see over 20–25 cases of stoke per year in this age group (http://www.
statistics.gov.uk/populationestimates).
The main differences between ischemic strokes occurring in
young adults and those occurring later in life, are the breakdown of
causes with a prominence of "unknown" and "other determined”
causes, and an overall good outcome. Although comparison is difficult
between studies for a number of reasons, including the methodology,
age groups, time scale and a change in the pathology and in our understanding
over time, a few findings are consistent throughout the
studies. First, traditional risk factors for stroke such as hypertension
and diabetes are not very frequent in young adults. Some other permanent
or transient risk factors such as smoking, use of oral contraceptives
, migraine, trauma, use of illicit drugs, and pregnancy or
puerperium have a more important role in this age group than in
older adults [2]. Second, the occurrence of atherosclerosis and atrial
fibrillation (AF), the major causes of ischemic stroke in older people,
are far less frequent in younger people. Instead, there are a number
of conditions which are characteristically seen in young stroke patients
, necessitating a different approach to investigation [3]. This is
the case for non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies (i.e., arterial dissection
) accounting for nearly 20% of strokes in this age group, and for
cardiac embolism [particularly related to interatrial abnormalities,
patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA)] accounting
for one fifth of cases. Another common finding is the large
proportion of cases with no determined cause, accounting for up to
50% of all strokes depending on how exhaustive the diagnostic
work-up was. What is consistently observed in all studies is the transition
in the fifth decade from a “young stroke” pattern to a pattern
seen in older stroke, with a sharp increase of incidence at this age, accompanied
by a shift from female dominance in the under 30s to a
majority of males over 45 years [1].
Genetics of ischemic stroke
Studies conducted in twins, families, and animal models provide
evidence for a genetic contribution to ischemic stroke, although the
extent of genetic predisposition is uncertain. In twins, concordance
rates for the disease were reported to be about 65% greater in monozygotic
than in dizygotic twins, but most twin studies have been relatively
small. In case–control studies, a family history of stroke was
shown to increase the risk of ischemic stroke by about 75%, which is
in line with the data from studies in twins, but a precise estimate is
difficult to ascertain. Studies on stroke intermediate phenotypes
(endophenotypes) support this view. Heritability estimates for
intima-media thickness (IMT), a surrogate measure for subclinical
atherosclerosis, range from about 30% to 60%, while estimates for cerebral
white-matter lesions, a surrogate marker for cerebral small
vessel disease, from 55% to 70%[4]. Finally, modifiable risk factors accounts
for about 60% of the attributable risk for stroke, leading to assume
that a significant proportion of stroke risk might be explained
by other conditions, including genetic factors. Genetic influence
could act at various levels: by predisposing to conventional risk factors
, by modulating the effects of such risk factors on the end organs,
or, alternatively, by a direct independent effect on stroke risk, infarct
size and outcome. Similarly, interactions between genes and the environmental
factors could occur at various levels. In addition, to make it
more complex, genetic predisposition could differ depending on age
and stroke subtype. Both twin and family-history studies found a
stronger genetic component in younger stroke patients than in
older individuals, and in large-vessel and small-vessel stroke than in
cryptogenic stroke or in cardioembolic stroke [4]. Genetic determinants
of ischemic stroke are traditionally divided into single-gene disorders
(mainly Mendelian conditions) and polygenic disorders
(where multiple genes act together to result in a certain phenotype).
This definition, however, is oversimplistic, as additional risk factors,
genetic and environmental, often play a modifying role in the final
disease phenotype even in Mendelian conditions.
The aims of this review are to summarize data on clinical, genetic
and epidemiologic aspects of monogenic conditions associated with
juvenile ischemic stroke, to discuss recentfindings and methodological
limitations regarding the genetics of sporadic ischemic stroke in
this age category, and to provide a brief overview of the potential future
approaches to stroke genetics.
Single gene disorders
Although monogenic disorders are an important cause of ischemic
stroke, they comprise less than 1% of all cases. To what extent these
specific heritable disorders contribute to the population of patients
with cerebral ischemia at young age is currently unknown. However,
indirect data indicate that the frequency of single-gene conditions in
this age category is probably higher because they often remain
undiagnosed, reflecting the substantial variability in their phenotypic
expression. Monogenic disorders are typically associated with stroke
in childhood or young adulthood, with certain stroke types and subtypes
, with the absence of other stroke risk factors, and with specific
phenotypes of the associated diseases[5]. Within recent years considerable
progress has been made in defining the underlying genetic
basis of many Mendelian and mitochondrial diseases which can
cause ischemic stroke and most of the major genes have been
mapped. This has provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying
these disorders and the more common sporadic stroke. At present
, there is no uniform classification for Mendelian stroke
syndromes. Criteria that may be useful include underlying mechanisms
, mode of inheritance, and the presence or absence of associated
symptoms. Table 1 lists the single-gene disorders which more frequently
cause ischemic stroke in young adults and summarizes their
molecular defects and clinical features.
Common multifactorial ischemic stroke
The genetic contribution to common multifactorial stroke seems
to be polygenic. Most likely, there are many alleles with small effect
sizes (relative riskb1.5). However, because of their wide distribution,
on a population basis the impact on stroke is large. It is increasingly
recognised that the effects of some alleles are limited to one or few
stroke subtypes and that effect sizes may vary depending on sex
and ethnic origin [4].
Candidate gene studies
Most previous studies investigating genetic risk factors for
human stroke have taken a candidate gene approach using case–
control methodologies. One of the great limitations of candidate
gene studies is that any given genetic variant has a low pre-test
probability of being truly associated with a phenotype. Candidate

gene studies also presuppose more understanding about pathophysiology
than is usually the case. This might explain why, although
large numbers of candidate genes have been investigated,
few associations have been consistently replicated. In individuals
of European descent non-stratified by age, associations have been
observed for common variants in the genes for coagulation factor
V, prothrombin, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTFHR),
and angiotensin-converting enzyme [6] and replicated in people
of non-European descent (mainly Chinese, Japanese and Korean individuals
) [7]. A meta-analysis of studies conducted on patients
with early-onset, adult ischemic stroke (aged 18–50 years) found
associations with modest effect for common variants in the genes
for MTHFR and apolipoprotein E (APOE) [8]. Though nonindependently
associated to an increased risk of premature stroke,
factor V Leiden (FVG1691A mutation) and prothrombin mutation
(PTG20210A mutation) might predispose to brain ischemia in specific subgroups of young individuals, such as those who carry cardiac
interatrial abnormalities, such as PFO [9],andthosetakingoral
contraceptives[10]. However, to be reliably detected, small relative
risks require large sample sizes, probably in the order of 1,000 patients
or more. Few studies have achieved such numbers and none
have included only juvenile stroke cases. This difficulty, together
with differences in sample characteristics and study design, could
explain much of the inconsistency between studies. The modest
success of candidate-gene studies provides support to alternative
systematic hypothesis-free approaches, such as genome-wide linkage
and genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
Genome-wide studies
Genome-wide linkage studies utilize family structure and large
numbers of tagging SNPs to track the inheritance of stroke risk with
the transmission of the SNP alleles. Although genome-wide linkage
studies have the ability to detect single risk loci with relatively large
effect, success has been limited. Early findings of a linkage between
stroke and SNPs in PDE4D (encoding cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase
4D)[11] and ALOX5AP (encoding arachidonate 5-
lipoxygenase-activating protein) [12] were not replicated consistently.
This could be due, in part, to a limited number and low frequency
in the population of genes of large effect for stroke, as well as difficulty
in procuring stroke family materials that would be required for
replication of the previous findings (Table 2). More recently, a
whole genome linkage scan of 109 families from a genetically homogeneous
region of Northern Sweden failed to identify any new major
loci for ischemic stroke [13].
GWASs have been used in the past few years to characterize large
samples of stroke cases and controls by screening for a huge number
of SNPs distributed through the genome. GWASs can identify novel
genetic loci, do not require a prespecified hypothesis implicating a
particular candidate pathway, and allows the application of the

association testing in a genome-wide manner. GWASs appear to be
much more powerful than genome-wide linkage studies for the identification of genetic variants underlying multifactorial diseases. So far,
GWASs have identified SNPs implicating hundreds of robustly replicated
loci for common traits, revealing the unexpected involvement
of certain functional and mechanistic pathways in a variety
of disease processes, thus, opening doors to potential novel therapeutic
targets. Although numerous analyses have been conducted
to investigate complex diseases, few GWASs have been performed
in the context of ischemic stroke. The first genome-wide association
study in stroke was reported from the Ischemic Stroke Genetics
Study (ISGS) in 2007[14]and found no genetic locus specifically
and robustly associated with the disease. After that, the same group
investigated the potential association between ischemic stroke and
variants in the chromosome 9p21 region, which was previously
found to be associated with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.
Although the pooled analysis demonstrated that 6 SNPs were independently
associated with atherosclerotic stroke, it is notable that
only a small subgroup of young stroke patients was included [15].
A separate analysis of over 400 patients with premature ischemic
stroke did not confirmtheassociationinyoungadults[16].None
of the other loci of interest (chromosomes 4q25; 16q22; and
12p13) [17-19] as well as genes (i.e., CELSR1, PRKCH) [20,21],initially
shown to be potentially associated with ischemic stroke
based on GWASs has been tested in large cohorts of young stroke
patients yet (Table 3).
Overall, despite the apparent series of discoveries that have often
been reported with GWASs of ischemic stroke, it is worth noting that
no GWASsfinding has been consistently replicated across studies, and
the results of the few GWASs targeting juvenile stroke are still unavailable.
In this regard, the Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic
Stroke Patients (CADISP) study (www.cadisp.org) [22] focusing on
cervical artery dissection, the most frequent cause of cerebral ischemia
at young age, and the Genetics of Early Onset Stroke (GEOS)
Study focusing on unselected young ischemic stroke patients
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?
study_id=phs000292.v1.p1) are currently under way to approach
this issue. It will be also relevant to explore whether genes supposed
to influence major stroke risk factors based on the results of GWASs
have any impact on juvenile stroke.
Mitochondrial studies
Common variants in mitochondrial genome are supposed to influence the occurrence of sporadic ischemic stroke, based on the
observation that so-called metabolic strokes and rarely even cardioembolic
strokes are part of the clinical spectrum of the syndrome
of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
symptoms (MELAS), a mitochondrial disorder occurring at young
age. This hypothesis has been tested in sparse case–control analyses
, including a recent multicenter GWAS, with conflicting results
[5].Again,noneoftheseanalysesspecifically targeted young stroke
patients.
Future directions
A number of new methodologies and technologies have been recently
developed, including gene expression profiling, proteomics, and
metabolomics, aimed at detecting functional changes induced by genetic
variations as well as by co-existent non-genetic factor. These offer the
potential for identifying blood biomarkers that can be useful in clinical
practice in assessing the magnitude of risk associated with specificmutations.
Similarly, pharmacogenomics, the study of how genetic variants
can influence drugresponse, offers the opportunity to personalize treatments
, dosing, and reduce side effects. Finally, the next generation
whole-sequencing (NGS) technologies will be able to explore unassayed
genome, to obtain the entire coding sequence in a short time,
and to makecomparisonsbetween genomes due to advances in computational
methods and processing power. Since this approach might enable
the identification of rare variants with intermediate to large effects
(as opposed to GWAS, which have so far targeted mainly common variants
), it might be of particular interest for stroke of unexplained etiology
occurring in the very young. So far, these techniques have been
rarely applied to ischemic stroke. As to the specific subgroup of younger
patients, the challenge will be to set up larger and well-phenotyped
