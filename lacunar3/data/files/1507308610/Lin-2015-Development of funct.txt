Abstract
The lenticulostriate artery plays a vital role in the onset and development of 
cerebral ischemia. However, current imaging techniques cannot assess the in vivo
functioning of small arteries such as the lenticulostriate artery in the brain of rats. 
Here, we report a novel method to achieve a high resolution multi-functional 
imaging of the cerebrovascular system using synchrotron radiation angiography, 
which is based on spatio-temporal analysis of contrast density in the arterial cross 
section. This method provides a unique tool for studying the sub-cortical vascular 
elasticity after cerebral ischemia in rats. Using this technique, we demonstrated 
that the vascular elasticity of the lenticulostriate artery decreased from day 1 to 
day 7 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats and recovered from 
day 7 to day 28 compared to the controls (p < 0.001), which paralleled with brain

edema formation and inversely correlated with blood flow velocity (p < 0.05). 
Our results demonstrated that the change of vascular elasticity was related to 
the levels of brain edema and the velocity of focal blood flow, suggesting that 
reducing brain edema is important for the improvement of the function of the 
lenticulostriate artery in the ischemic brain.

1. Introduction
Lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs), branching from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the 
human and rodent brain, are major feeding arteries for the corpus striatum in the sub-cortex 
and extremely important for ensuring regular brain nutrition supply (Marinkovic et al 2001). 
The restoration of blood flow in LSAs is highly related to neural survival and functional 
recovery in corpus striatum after ischemic stroke. During the acute phase of ischemia, blood 
flow is absent in LSAs and then restored after reperfusion. The endothelial cells of LSAs can 
be damaged during the ischemic phase, which further affects the reperfusion ability of LSAs. 
According to our previous study (Lu et al 2012), functional angiogenesis of micro-vasculature 
is a main target of ischemic neural repair which firstly requires a sufficient blood supply from 
major arteries. Therefore, restoration of LSAs is a key point in therapy and rehabilitation of 
ischemic stroke in the sub-cortex. Development of new therapeutic methods is facilitated by 
an in vivo imaging technique which can monitor the restoration ability of LSAs with high 
spatial resolution, especially for pre-clinical small animal studies.
However, current in vivo techniques for assessing cerebral vasculature and arterial functions
still suffer from insufficient imaging resolution. Microscopic computed tomography 
(Micro-CT) provides a good resolution (about 10μm) for tissue samples but with a much 
lower resolution (larger than 100μm) in vivo. Furthermore, Micro-CT imaging cannot provide
blood flow or functional information (Holdsworth and Thornton 2002). Digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) is another x-ray based imaging method for assessment of vascular 
abnormalities in both clinical and animal studies, but with limited spatial resolution (larger 
than 100μm). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has better resolution (about 50μm) 
in imaging and shows the cerebral vasculature and hemodynamics of small animals in vivo
(Shih et al 2012, Liu et al 2014). Nevertheless, all of these techniques still do not allow 
direct visualization of small intracranial arteries such as penetrating arteries, LSAs and newly 
formed small vessels. Doppler micro-ultrasonography is the most useful method to obtain the 
vascular hemodynamics in clinic and animal studies, but its spatial resolution is reduced with 
an increased depth of penetration (Greco et al 2012). Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) 
and near-infrared fluorescence imaging provide sufficient resolution (about 15 μm) and could 
provide both vasculature and hemodynamic information in vivo. Unfortunately, the penetrating
depth of the optical imaging intrinsically limits their applications in sub-cortex studies 
(Welsher et al 2011, Hong et al 2012, Lin et al 2013). For imaging vascular functions, radial 
artery pulse wave analysis of optical imaging data is proposed to examine the arterial elasticity 
(Cohn et al 1995, Zheng and Mayhew 2009).
Synchrotron radiation x-ray based angiography (SRA), a state-of-the-art technique, provides
a useful in vivo imaging tool for rodent cerebral vasculature (Kidoguchi et al 2006, 
X Lin et al Phys. Med. Biol. 60 (2015) 1655

Lu et al 2012, Lin et al 2013, Shirai et al 2013, Yuan et al 2013). Previous studies demonstrated
the SRA was capable of investigating the morphology of LSAs in mice with 30μm 
high spatial resolution (Yuan et al 2013). Here, we reported the application of in vivo functional
SRA (fSRA) for measuring the elasticity and blood flow velocity (BFV) of the LSAs 
in rats based on a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. To explore the 
potential mechanism, we further analyzed the relationships among the elasticity of LSAs, 
blood flow velocity (BFV) and brain edema after ischemic injury.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. fSRA
An SRA experiment was conducted at the BL13W beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility (SSRF). The imaging setup is shown in figure 1(a). After monochromatization
of x-ray light sprouting out from a bending magnet, x-ray energy of 33.2KeV with 
flux of 2.38 × 1010 photonssecond−1mm−2 was obtained for the imaging purpose. To control
the ionizing radiation dose, a x-ray shutter was placed before the sample stage. A PCO 
x-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (pixel size of 9 × 9μm, FOV of 20 × 4.5mm, 
PCO-TECH Inc, Germany) was placed 65cm away from the sample stage and used to 
obtain x-ray transmission images continuously with a 4fps frame rate and exposure time 
of 35ms.
For animal preparation, an angiographic tube (connecting a PE10 tube to a PE50 tube) was 
inserted into the external carotid artery (ECA) to the bifurcation of common carotid artery 
(CCA) for contrast agent injection (figure 1(b)). Before imaging, the rat was placed vertically 
to the beam path on its left side. During imaging, 150μl of non-ionic iodine contrast agent 
(Ipamiro, Shanghai, China) with a concentration of 175mgIml−1  (350mgIml−1, diluted to 
50% volume ratio with saline) was injected into the ECA through the angiographic tube at 
an injecting rate of 133.3µls−1 which was controlled by a micro-syringe pump (LSP01-1A,

Longerpump, Baoding, China). Two layers of angiographic images were acquired to obtain 
the entire hemisphere vasculature. In other words, we conducted SRA twice in each animal by 
moving the animal up and down.
In the imaging procedure, sequential x-ray transmission images I(x, y, t) of the rat brain 
were recorded (figure 2(a)). Because the injected contrast agent provided sufficient absorption 
contrast of blood flow and vasculature, Berr–Lambert’s law was used to obtain the absorption 
maps I x y t ( , , ) abs which were proportional to the density distributions of contrast agent (equation
(1)). In this study, relative blood flow and vascular elasticity were estimated from the 
absorption maps I x y t ( , , ) . abs
= − I x y t I x y I x y t ( , , ) ln( ( , , 0)) ln( ( , , ) ) abs (1)
where I(x, y, t) was the recorded images (there is no contrast agent injection when t = 0).
Before the estimation of relative blood flow and vascular elasticity, image sequences 
I x y t ( , , ) abs were firstly calculated. Then based on the absorption map, the blood vessels were 
manually segmented. The binary images of blood vessels were used to obtain the vessel center 
line (ridge) and corresponding outlines automatically. The diameter r0 of each vessel was calculated
for each ridge point (figure 2(b)). Then, the absorption data of the cross-section line 
at each ridge point in I x y t ( , , ) abs was extracted based on the perpendicular relation between 
ridge and cross-section. Then the spatio-temporal dynamics Irt(r, t) of each cross-section were 
constructed from the image sequences I x y t ( , , ) abs (figure 2(c), figure S1(b))(stacks.iop.org/
PMB/60/1655).
As the first-pass of the contrast agent (time = 0), the I rt(r, t) demonstrated diffusion shape 
and reached saturation after time t0. During this period, the spatial range and density of contrast
agent were spreading and accumulated. In this study, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the 
contrast agent in Irt(r, t) (t < t0) were fitted to a Gaussian surface (equation (2)). As an absorption
imaging technique, the contrast agent at other depths along the light path may introduce 
noise in the Irt(r, t) of the corresponding cross-section. However, a surface fitting technique 
can efficiently suppress the noise and provide a robust estimation of fitting parameters.

Based on a recent study (Hong et al 2012) the normalized slope of density versus time is proportional
to the blood velocity. Therefore, after the estimation of fitting parameters in equation

2.2. Experimental design
Protocols of animal experiments used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Thirtysix
adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Sppir-BK Inc, Shanghai, China) weighing 250–280grams 
were used in this study. Animals (5 groups, n = 6 per group) underwent magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and SRA 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28d after tMCAO to detect brain lesions. Animals 
characterized with MRI and SRA without tMCAO were used as sham (n = 6). The mean arterial
blood pressure (MABP) was measured before MRI by an automatic sphygmomanometer 
(BP-98A, Softron, Tokyo, Japan), using the noninvasive tail cuff technique.
2.3. Surgery procedure of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
The surgical procedure for tMCAO was described previously (Tang et al 2014). Briefly, rats were 
anesthetized with ketamine (100mgkg−1) and xylazine (10mgkg−1) intraperitoneally. Rats were 
then supinely placed on a surgical board and body temperature was maintained at 37°C by a 
heating pad (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). After a midline neck incision was made, the 
ECA, the CCA and the internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated under an operating microscope 
(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Then, the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) was ligated to improve the 
model stability and to eliminate interference. A 4-0 suture (20mm, Dermalon, 1744-31, Covidien, 
OH) coated with silicone rubber (length = 3mm, diameter = 0.4mm, Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, 
Germany) was inserted into the ECA stump, reversed into the ICA and finally to the ostium of the 
MCA (a slight resistance was felt). The success of occlusion was characterized as the reduction 
of cortical blood flow down to 20% of the baseline, which was measured by a laser Doppler flowmetry
(Moor Instruments, Devon, England). After 90min of occlusion with ligation of the CCA, 
the suture was removed and the CCA was released for the reperfusion procedure.
2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging examination
A MRI examination was performed before and after the tMCAO using a 3T MR apparatus 
(Signa3T, GE Healthcare, CT) using an animal head coil with T2-weighted fast spin-echo 
sequence (TR = 2000ms, TE = 40ms, matrix = 160 × 192, FOV = 6.0 × 6.0cm; slice thickness
=1.0mm; inter slice distance = 0mm). Rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine 
intraperitoneally during MRI. After MRI reconstruction, brain edema volume was measured

using ImageJ and calculated by subtracting the non-edema volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere
from the total volume in the contralateral hemisphere and then dividing by the volume 
of the contralateral hemisphere.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Brain edema volume, MABP and diameter of ICA, posterior cerebral artery (PCA), MCA 
and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were presented as mean ± SD. Vascular elasticity, blood 
flow velocity and diameter of the LSAs were expressed as median ± (25th, 75th centiles). 
All data were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Student’s t-test. A probability 
value of less than 5% was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Elasticity changes of LSAs after tMCAO
We manually segmented the LSAs from the vasculature of each rat and calculated the elasticity
of the LSAs using the fSRA method (equation (4)). The elasticity map of the entire 
vasculature and enlarged view of LSAs are shown in figure 3. Statistical results demonstrated 
that the elasticity of the LSAs was reduced from day 1 to day 7 after tMCAO (p < 0.001) and 
then increased from day 7 to day 28. Compared to LSAs, the elasticity of the MCA was not 
changed after tMCAO (Data not shown).

demonstrated the vascular elasticity in LSAs in sham rats (a, c) and rats after 1 (d), 3

in LSAs was shown in (b). Bar =1mm. ***p < 0.001, sham versus day 1, 3, 7 and 14;

3.2. Changes of LSAs’ elasticity paralleled with brain edema developments 
after tMCAO
To assess the developments of brain edema after tMCAO, we calculated the brain edema 
volume using T2-weighted MRI. We found that the brain edema occurred in MCA area and 
increased until day 3, following which, edema volume decreased at day 7. Then, tissue hydration
appeared at day 14 and continued to increase to day 28 (figure 4). Tissue hydration is 
presented as the lack of tissue structure with high-intensity signal. The changes of LSAs’ 
elasticity paralleled with brain edema after tMCAO, which was gradually decreased until day 
7 and then recovered after day 7 (figure 4). MABP shows no significant changes after tMCAO 
(figure 4), indicating that the brain edema and LSAs’ elasticity were not influenced by MABP 
in this study.
3.3. Changes of LSAs’ elasticity were inversely correlated to BFV after tMCAO
We also calculated the relative BFV in LSAs using fSRA method (equation (3)) to investigate 
the relations between vascular elasticity and BFV. Interestingly, the changes in BFV were 
inversely correlated to vascular elasticity. The relative BFV of LSAs was reduced at day 1 and 
then increased from day 1 to day 7, peaked at day 7, finally decreased and recovered from day 
7 to day 28 (figure 5).
3.4. Diameter of LSAs was not changed after tMCAO
Using SRA, we studied the ipsilateral brain vascular morphology after tMCAO. The morphology
of the ICA, the PCA, the MCA and their branches such as LSAs and cortical penetrating 
arteries can be obtained in vivo. There are no statistically significant changes in the diameters 
of LSAs, ICA, PCA and MCA after tMCAO, even though brain edema changed after tMCAO 
(figure 6, table 1). This result indicated that the evaluation of LSAs’ elasticity was not due to 
the morphology changes of LSAs (figure 6).

To increase image contrast, the original data of figure 2(a) was enhanced by an adaptive
histogram equalization method. However, for quantitatively comparing the morphologic 
changes under different conditions, figure 6 just presented the original data. Additionally, 
figure 2(a) showed the entire brain vasculature while figure 6(a) was only a small region. 
So the contrast in figure 6(c–h) seems reduced with respect to figure 2(a).
4. Discussion
The functional recovery of LSAs is closely related to rehabilitation after cerebral ischemia. 
Current imaging methods for arterial functions cannot provide sub-cortical arterial elasticity 
and BFV both in high resolution. Here, we report fSRA technique as a new tool to simultaneously
obtain anatomical, hemodynamic and elastic information in rodent arteries.
In this study, changes in LSAs after tMCAO are investigated using the fSRA method. 
After tMCAO, the changes in LSAs’ elasticity demonstrate a correlation with the changes 
in BFV and brain edema. However, the pathogenesis of this phenomenon was still unclear. 
Brain edema was mainly caused by cytotoxicity in the early stage and angioedema in the later 
stage after stroke. The cerebral blood volume can be changed after stroke and is promoted 
by exchange of water between capillaries and surrounding tissues (Krieger et al 2012). In 
consideration of the self-adjusting capacity of the brain, the arterial functions may be selfregulating
to maintain the cerebral water content after stroke. Fluctuations in small arterial 
elasticity may also be caused by functional or structural alterations that are closely linked 
to endothelial dysfunction (Grey et al 2003). During brain ischemia, the LSAs lack blood

supply, which seriously impacts the endothelial cells’ survival (Hayashi et al 1998). Many 
studies have reported that protecting the endothelial cells by VEGF treatment can significantly
improve the blood flow after brain reperfusion ( Hayashi et al 1998, Ferrara et al
2003). The alteration of vascular functions was also related to the changes in the Nitric 
oxide-dependent vasodilatation pathway, which may be associated with endothelial dysfunction
(Lamireau et al 2002). Therefore, up-regulation of vasoconstrictor receptors (for example
, endothelin type B, angiotensin type 1 and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1B/1D receptors) 
in cerebral arteries after different types of stroke was revealed in recent studies (Edvinsson 
and Povlsen 2011). It implied that those therapies may improve the outcome after stroke via 
improving the vascular functions.

Lin et al (Lin et al 2002) reported that the cerebral blood flow velocity increased in the ipsilateral
cortex from day 1 to day 14 and peaked at day 7 after stroke monitored by MRI, however
, our results showed that the BFV of LSAs was only increased from day 1 to day 7, and 
peaked on day 7. This result suggests that the blood flow alteration may differ between cortex 
and sub-cortex after stroke. It is also interesting that the cerebral blood flow was decreased 
to less than 50% of baseline between 1 and 2d after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is 
contradictory with ischemic stroke (Yang et al 1994).
Given the many benefits of fSRA over other basic imaging methodologies, this imaging 
technique could also be utilized in other cerebrovascular and cardiovascular research, such as 
intracranial aneurysms and atherosclerosis, which is often due to hemodynamic and arterial 
dysfunction (Cebral et al 2011, Rautou et al 2011). fSRA may also have potential applications 
for monitoring arterial functions in hypertension, diabetes and arthrosclerosis caused by high 
cholesterol which may cause cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (Grey et al 2003). 
Furthermore, due to the similar principles of SRA and DSA, the theory of fSRA may also be 
used in clinical diagnoses of hemodynamic and vascular elasticity to analyze arterial functions 
in patients by post processing the DSA data.
However, fSRA still has some disadvantages that need to be overcome in the future. Firstly, 
the ionizing radiation effects caused by the synchrotron radiation x-ray still are uncertain, which 
is a major challenge to transferring it to clinical use, though it has already been used in clinical 
research (Elleaume et al 2000). Secondly, the limited frames per second of the CCD camera 
makes it difficult to accurately track the BFV for small arteries (Lin et al 2013). The frame frequency
in Spring-8 was 30fps when small animal SRA was conducted, which makes the measurement
of the BFV more accurate (Kidoguchi et al 2006, Jenkins et al 2012, Shirai et al 2013).
5. Conclusion
In summary, we reported a reliable in vivo technique, fSRA, to measure the sub-cortical arterial
elasticity and BFV based on synchrotron radiation angiography in small animals. Using 
this novel method, we found that the LSAs’ elasticity fluctuated after ischemic stroke and may 
be related to BFV and brain edema change.
