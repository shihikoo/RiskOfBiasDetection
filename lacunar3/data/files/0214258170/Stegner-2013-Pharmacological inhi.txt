Platelet plug formation at sites of vascular injury is essential 
for normal hemostasis, but under pathological conditions 
it can lead to full vessel occlusion resulting in myocardial 
infarction or ischemic stroke, which are both leading causes 
of death worldwide.1–3 Platelet inhibition is commonly used 
for the prevention of secondary stroke, but its use is often limited
because of increased risk of intracranial hemorrhages.4
Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches with a better safety 
profile are required. On the basis of animal models, targeting 
glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) or its principal ligand von Willebrand 
factor has been suggested as such an alternative approach.5–7
Phospholipase D (PLD) is a lipid signaling enzyme that 
catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic
acid and choline.8 Phosphatidic acid can be dephosphorylated
to form diacylglycerol, thereby generating a second 
important intracellular signaling molecule. The 2 mammalian 
PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, are widely expressed and 
are 50% identical in amino acid sequence.8,9 PLD1 and PLD2 
locate to distinct intracellular membrane compartments and 
have been implicated in many important signaling pathways 
and cell biological processes.8,10 In platelets, both PLD isoforms
are present and become activated upon stimulation 
with various agonists.9,11 Recently, we demonstrated that 
PLD1 contributes to GPIb-dependent platelet integrin activation
, whereas absence of both PLD isoforms leads to a defect 
in α-granule release in addition to the defects observed in 
PLD1-deficient platelets.12 Moreover, Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice 
are protected from arterial thrombosis and ischemic stroke 
but do not exhibit hemostatic defects.11 These findings have 
led to the proposal that PLD could serve as a target for safe 
antithrombotic therapy,13 but in vivo evidence in support of 
this concept has not been reported yet.
For many years, inhibition of PLD-dependent generation of 
phosphatidic acid was achieved using 1-butanol; however, it 
has now been compellingly demonstrated that this approach 
creates off-target effects, making it difficult to interpret reports 
that drew conclusions using this tool.14,15 In recent years, 
however, PLD inhibition has become achievable using small 
molecule inhibitors.16 An inhibitor screen identified 5-fluoro-
2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI) as a potent and reversible
inhibitor of both PLD isoforms, with a half-life of 5.5 
hours in vivo and moderate bioavailability.14,17 Further studies 
confirmed its specificity and effectiveness for inhibiting PLD 
through observation of PLD-dependent phenotypes in FIPI-
treated cells.14,18–20 Moreover, FIPI has become an essential tool 
for studying the physiological relevance of PLD in therapeutic

Objective—We recently showed that mice lacking the lipid signaling enzyme phospholipase (PL) D1 or both PLD isoforms 
(PLD1 and PLD2) were protected from pathological thrombus formation and ischemic stroke, whereas hemostasis was 
not impaired in these animals. We sought to assess whether pharmacological inhibition of PLD activity affects hemostasis, 
thrombosis, and thrombo-inflammatory brain infarction in mice.
Approach and Results—Treatment of platelets with the reversible, small molecule PLD inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2-indolyl deschlorohalopemide
(FIPI), led to a specific blockade of PLD activity that was associated with reduced α-granule release 
and integrin activation. Mice that received FIPI at a dose of 3 mg/kg displayed reduced occlusive thrombus formation 
upon chemical injury of carotid arteries or mesenterial arterioles. Similarly, FIPI-treated mice had smaller infarct sizes 
and significantly better motor and neurological function 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. This 
protective effect was not associated with major intracerebral hemorrhage or prolonged tail bleeding times.
Conclusions—These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological PLD inhibition might provide a safe therapeutic 
strategy to prevent arterial thrombosis and ischemic stroke. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2013;33:2212-2217.)

settings. FIPI is an analog of the psychiatric drug halopemide,21
a dopamine receptor antagonist.22 FIPI is 2 orders of magnitude 
more potent than halopemide for PLD2 inhibition21; nonetheless
, halopemide is used clinically at levels that should accomplish
full PLD inhibition,22 suggesting that PLD inhibition in 
humans can be achieved without overt toxicity. We recently 
demonstrated that FIPI treatment prevents tumor growth and 
metastasis in mice to the same extent as genetic ablation of 
Pld1.23 In that study, mice received FIPI for ≤10 days with no 
apparent toxicity. This indicates, together with the overall unaltered
appearance of Pld1−/−/Pld2−/−mice, that the absence or 
blockade of PLD activity is compatible with normal development
and physiology.11,23 Here, we show that pharmacological 
inhibition of PLD activity with FIPI specifically reduced PLD-
dependent α-granule release and integrin activation resulting 
in decreased thrombosis and infarct progression during acute 
stroke in mice without affecting hemostasis.

Results
FIPI Treatment Abolishes PLD Activity 
and Leads to Defective Integrin 
Activation and α-Granule Release
It has been shown that platelets of Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice display
defective integrin activation and α-granule release on 
platelet stimulation with intermediate concentration of thrombin.11 To assess whether the small, reversible PLD inhibitor 
FIPI specifically inhibits PLD and whether this leads to the 
same effects as observed in the PLD1/2 double-deficient mice, 
we analyzed PLD activity and platelet activation on FIPI treatment.
Although platelet stimulation with thrombin triggered 
PLD activity in vehicle-treated platelets, FIPI dose-dependently
inhibited PLD activity (Figure 1A). In subsequent in 
vitro experiments we chose to use 100 nmol/L FIPI because 
this was the lowest concentration that abolished PLD activity
, consistent with results for other cell types.14 Treatment of 
platelets with this concentration of FIPI did not alter glycoprotein
expression on the platelet surface (data not shown). 
Integrin activation and P-selectin exposure, as a measurement 
for α-granule release, were analyzed flow cytometrically in 
vehicle- and FIPI-treated wild-type and Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice to 
test for potential off-target effects created by FIPI. The results 
revealed decreased integrin activation and α-granule release 
in FIPI-treated platelets upon stimulation with an intermediate 
concentration (3 mU/mL) of thrombin (Figure 1B). Reduction 
of platelet activation was observed to a similar extent in PLD-
deficient mice, and no additional effects of FIPI treatment 
were seen for PLD1/2-deficient platelets, indicating that the 
mechanism of action for FIPI in inhibiting platelet activation 
proceeds through inhibition of PLD. Next, we assessed von 
Willebrand factor secretion as a second readout for α-granule 
secretion. Consistent with the reduced P-selectin exposure, 
FIPI-treated platelets secreted less von Willebrand factor on 
thrombin stimulation when compared with vehicle-treated 
platelets (Figure 1C), confirming that FIPI specifically inhibits 
α-degranulation. Similar results were obtained when repeating
flow cytometric assays and ELISAs with platelets treated 
at a dose of 500 nmol/L, the calculated plasma concentration 
on injection of 3 mg/kg FIPI (data not shown).23
Although PLD1/2-deficient platelets are able to aggregate 
normally, we wanted to analyze ex vivo whether FIPI might 
affect platelet–platelet interaction because of off-target effects 
by performing aggregation studies. For this purpose, mice 
received 3 mg/kg FIPI 1 and 13 hours before the start of the

experiment. This treatment has been shown to block PLD 
activity in circulating platelets and presumably many other cell 
types, without causing any obvious side effects.23 Similarly, in 
our hands, FIPI-treated mice did not show any apparent signs 
of distress and behaved normally. Theoretically, the treatment
of mice with a dose of 3 mg/kg FIPI should lead to a 
plasma concentration of ≈500 nmol/L FIPI.23 Because FIPI 
is a reversible inhibitor14 that is washed away during platelet
isolation, aggregation studies were performed in platelet-rich
plasma. Under these conditions, it is necessary to 
use protease-activated receptor 4–activating peptide instead 
of thrombin to stimulate the protease-activated receptor 4 
receptor, as heparin is still present. Collagen-related peptide
and protease-activated receptor 4 induced platelet aggregation
indistinguishably in the platelet-rich plasma of vehicleand
FIPI-treated mice (Figure 1D). Together, these findings 
show that FIPI treatment leads to the same effects as seen in 
PLD1/2-deficient mice, providing strong support that FIPI 
specifically blocks PLD and does not exert off-target effects.
FIPI Treatment Results in Impaired 
Thrombus Formation In Vivo Without 
Exerting Obvious Off-Target Effects
To test whether pharmacological inhibition of PLD is a feasible
antithrombotic strategy, we assessed the in vivo effects of 
FIPI. To test the effect of FIPI treatment on thrombus formation
in different vascular beds in vivo, 2 well-established arterial
thrombosis models were used. In the first model, the right 
carotid artery was injured by topical application of ferric chloride
, and blood flow was monitored with an ultrasonic flow 
probe.12 In all but one of the control mice, the injured arteries 
occluded within 10 minutes, whereas thrombus formation was 
delayed in FIPI-treated mice and only 3 of 9 vessels occluded 
during the 30-minute observation period (Figure 2A and 2B). 
In the second model, mesenteric arterioles were chemically 
injured and thrombus formation monitored using intravital 
microscopy.24 Initial binding of platelets to the vessel wall 
and early aggregate formation was comparable in vehicleand
FIPI-treated mice (11.5±3.1 versus 11.4±3.0 minutes; 
Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). However, 
although vessels of control mice occluded after 20.7±3.9 
minutes, time to occlusion in FIPI-treated mice was significantly
prolonged (25.1±7.7 minutes; Figure 2C and 2D) 
very similar to the results previously obtained in mice lacking
both PLD isoforms.11 To analyze whether the antithrombotic
effect can be ascribed to FIPI-mediated suppression of 
PLD activity, we performed the mesenteric arteriole thrombosis
model with vehicle- and FIPI-treated Pld1−/−/Pld2−/−
mice. The time-to-first appearance of thrombi of >10 µm 
was comparable between all groups (Figure I in the onlineonly
Data Supplement). Whereas all control mice occluded 
within the 40-minute observation period (mean occlusion 
time, 14.2±3.8 minutes), 4 of the 13 vehicle-treated Pld1−/−/
Pld2−/− mice exhibited no vessel occlusion and the time to 
vessel occlusion for the full set of PLD-deficient mice was 
increased (mean occlusion time, 19.8±6.4 minutes), confirming
previously published data.11 Similarly, vessel wall injury 
in FIPI-treated Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice led to delayed vessel 
occlusion (at 22.2±7.6 minutes, on average) and in 2 of 13 
vessels no occlusion occurred. These findings suggest that 
the antithrombotic effect of FIPI is specifically mediated by 
pharmacological inhibition of PLD.
FIPI Treatment Exerts Protection From Ischemic 
Stroke Without Impairing Hemostasis
Mice lacking PLD1 or both PLD isoforms are protected from 
infarct progression in a model of ischemic stroke.11,12 To test 
whether PLD inhibition can reproduce this protective effect, 
FIPI-treated mice were subjected to 60-minute transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct volumes

of FIPI-treated mice 24 hours after infarction, as assessed by 
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride staining, were reduced to 
≈60% of infarct volumes in control mice (108.7±35.4 versus 
65.5±19.5 mm3; Figure 3A). Accordingly, these mice had 
significantly better motor and global neurological function, 
which was determined by the grip test and Bederson score, 
respectively (Figure 3B and 3C). Serial MRI on a separate 
group of mice confirmed that ischemic lesions were significantly
smaller in FIPI-treated mice (151.4±20.0 versus 
90.5±21.8 mm3; Figure 3D). Hemorrhagic transformations, 
which would be visible as hyper-intense areas within the 
infarcted brains, were present in neither the control nor the 
FIPI-treated mice (Figure 3D). This argues against a major 
effect of FIPI treatment on vascular integrity in the setting of 
acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, mice treated with FIPI 
at a dose of 3 mg/kg displayed unaltered tail bleeding times 
compared with control mice (5.1±2.4 versus 3.7±2.7 minutes
; Figure 3E), demonstrating that PLD inhibition did not 
impair normal hemostasis. We also treated mice with 6 mg/kg 
FIPI, which is the highest possible concentration still soluble 
in 4% dimethyl sulfoxide in saline and performed tail bleeding
assays. Bleeding in these mice similarly ceased at 5.7±1.9 
minutes, demonstrating that even higher FIPI concentrations 
do not have an impact on tail bleeding times (Figure 3E). 
Although there is a lack of correlation between bleeding time 
and risk of clinical hemorrhages,25 our data suggest that pharmacological
PLD inhibition is a safe and effective treatment 
for the inhibition of thrombotic activity and for the prevention 
of ischemic stroke.
Therapeutic FIPI Treatment Does Not 
Protect Mice From Ischemic Stroke
In another transient MCAO experiment, we investigated 
whether FIPI provides therapeutic benefit in the setting of 
acute stroke by treating the mice with 3 mg/kg FIPI directly 
after MCAO and 8 hours later. In this setting, no protective 
effect of FIPI treatment was observed. Infarct volumes of 
FIPI-treated mice (120.0±24.6 mm3) were comparable with 
those of vehicle-treated mice (116.5±26.1 mm3; Figure 4A). 
Consequently, the motorical and global neurological outcomes 
of the mice were diminished to the same extent (Figure 4B 
and 4C). In addition, we performed transient MCAO of mice 
treated with 6 mg/kg FIPI to assess whether higher amount of 
FIPI might exert therapeutic effects. In fact, with the doubled 
amount of FIPI, which is also the highest applicable concentration
, we did observe a tendency toward decreased infarct 
volumes (86.9±45.0 mm3) and a slightly better neurological 
outcome 24 hours after transient MCAO (Figure 4).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that FIPI, as a model inhibitor of PLD 
activity, induces potent protection of mice from thrombotic 
events and ischemic stroke without any detectable effects 
on hemostasis. Our findings are in accordance with the data 
obtained in Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice11,12 and with a previous report 
showing that pharmacological PLD inhibition phenocopies 
genetic Pld1 ablation in a mouse cancer model, suggesting 
potential employment of FIPI as a cancer therapeutic.23 By in 
vitro and in vivo analysis of FIPI-treated Pld1−/−/Pld2−/− mice, 
we were able to show that FIPI specifically inhibits PLD-
mediated integrin activation and α-granule release, resulting 
in an antithrombotic effect in vivo.
Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that prophylactic 
FIPI treatment markedly protects mice from infarct progression
in the setting of acute stroke. It is of particular interest 
to develop effective and safe treatments for acute stroke and 
secondary stroke prevention because conventional therapies
with platelet aggregation inhibitors are associated with 
an increased bleeding risk. The paucity of effective therapy 
makes stroke one of the leading causes of death and disability
worldwide.1,26 Platelet inhibition, for example, by blocking 
GPIIb/IIIa, protects from arterial thrombosis but also leads 
to increased intracerebral hemorrhages in the setting of acute 
stroke.4,7,27 Notably, FIPI treatment, like GPIb-blockade,7 had

no obvious effect on intracranial hemostasis. This further supports
our previous studies that suggested interfering with the 
GPIb-von Willebrand factor axis and downstream signaling 
molecules as a promising strategy to inhibit thrombotic activity
and prevent secondary infarction.3,7
However, therapeutic treatment with FIPI, even at high 
doses, provided only a tendency toward protective effects in 
ischemic stroke. This stands in contrast to the strong therapeutic
effect of GPIb blockade7 which is not explained at 
present. We speculate that this might be because of limited 
bioavailability of FIPI and potentially an insufficient rate 
of drug delivery from the intraperitoneal site of injection. 
Further studies with optimized PLD inhibitors or improved 
drug delivery methods (eg, intravenous) are required to judge 
the efficacy of PLD inhibition in the setting of acute stroke. 
Analogs of FIPI that are also PLD1/PLD2 dual inhibitors 
are being developed and may eventually provide effective 
options for PLD inhibition in vivo.28 Nevertheless, prophylactic
blockade of PLD activity may help to decrease the risk 
of vessel reocclusion after thrombolytic therapy in secondary 
stroke prevention.
Markedly, pharmacologically and genetically induced PLD 
inhibition had no obvious side effects, as already described 
by Chen et al,23 and did not induce intracranial hemorrhages, 
although PLD activity was affected in all cells. Accordingly, 
such a safe therapy might be particularly advantageous in clinical
practice. For this reason, new PLD inhibitors need to be 
screened and analyzed to gain optimized drug delivery, greater 
potency, and bioavailability. Nevertheless, our study provides 
a proof-of-principle that small molecule inhibition of PLD1 
or both isoforms constitutes a potent antithrombotic approach 
and suggests that FIPI could serve as a good lead structure for 
drug optimization.
In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that 
pharmacological inhibition of PLD activity results in efficient 
and safe protection from arterial thrombosis and ischemic 
stroke without affecting hemostasis.

Platelet inhibition is a major strategy to prevent acute ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which is, however, often associated
with an increased bleeding risk. Phospholipase (PL) D1, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid, is a 
promising target for antithrombotic therapy because mice lacking PLD are protected from arterial thrombosis and ischemic stroke, whereas 
hemostasis is unaffected. However, in vivo evidence in support of this concept has been lacking. In the current study, we used the PLD 
inhibitor 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI) as prototype anti-PLD agent and found that FIPI treatment results in protection from 
arterial thrombosis. Similarly, FIPI treatment reduced brain infarct sizes and improved motor and neurological function after transient middle 
cerebral artery occlusion. This protective effect was not associated with intracerebral hemorrhages or prolonged tail bleeding times. Hence, 
these results provide the first direct evidence that pharmacological PLD inhibition might be a safe therapeutic strategy to prevent arterial 
thrombosis and ischemic stroke.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Mice
6-10-week-old C57BL/6 or Pld1-/-/Pld2-/- mice1 were used for all experiments. Animal studies 
were approved by the district government of Lower Franconia (Bezirksregierung 
Unterfranken).
Pharmacological inhibition of PLD with FIPI
For in vitro experiments washed platelets were incubated with 100nM, 500nM or the 
indicated concentrations of FIPI for 5 min at 37°C. For prophylactic treatment mice received 
intraperitoneal injections of FIPI (Sigma, Schnelldorf, Germany) at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 
6 mg/kg body weight in 4% DMSO/96% saline 13 h and 1 h before start of the in vivo 
experiment.2 For therapeutic treatment of mice in the tMCAO model mice received 3 mg/kg 
or 6 mg/kg FIPI after reperfusion and 8 h later. Control mice were treated accordingly with 
vehicle.
Platelet preparation and PLD activity measurements
Washed platelets were prepared as described.3 To determine PLD activity the formation of 
[3H] phosphatidylethanol ([3H] Ptd-EtOH) was measured using standard protocols.4, 5 Washed 
platelets were adjusted to a final concentration of 3 x 108 platelets/ml and were labelled with 
3.7 kBp/ml [3H]-palmitic acid (Perkin Elmer) at 37°C for 1 h. Aliquots of 80μl  were  preincubated
with 0.5% ethanol for 10 min and then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 U/ml) or CRP 
(10 µg/ml) in the presence of 2 mM CaCl
2
. Reactions were stopped by adding 500μl of icecold
chloroform/methanol and placing on ice. 500μl  ice-cold chloroform and 350 µl water 
were added to extract the lipids, which were collected in the organic phase and separated by 
thin layer chromatography. [3H] Ptd-EtOH bands were identified through co-migration with 
standards and quantified by scintillation. PLD activity is depicted as percentage of 
phosphatidylethanol of total [3H]-labelled phospholipids.
Platelet aggregation and flow cytometry
Platelet rich plasma was stimulated with indicated agonists and aggregation was measured 
by recording transmission on a four-channel aggregometer (Fibrintimer; APACT) for 10 min. 
Aggregation was expressed in arbitrary units, with buffer representing 100% transmission.
For flow cytometry, heparinized whole blood was diluted 1:20, and incubated with the 
appropriate fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 15 min at room temperature 
and analysed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
Measurement of vWF secretion
Washed platelets were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5 x 106 platelets/μl and activated 
in the presence of 1.4 µM indometacin and 2 U/ml apyrase with indicated agonists for 15 min 
at 37°C. Platelets were immediately centrifuged. VWF in the supernatant was quantified by 
ELISA using unconjugated and horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-hvWF 
antibodies (DAKO). 
Carotid artery thrombosis model
Mice were anesthetized and the right carotid artery was exposed through a vertical midline 
incision in the neck. An ultrasonic flow probe (0.5PSB699; Transonic System) was placed 
around the vessel and thrombosis was induced by topical application of a 0.5 mm by 1 mm

filter paper saturated with 15% FeCl

for 1 min and 30 s. Blood flow was monitored until full 
occlusion of the vessel occurred or for 30 min.
Anesthetic drugs
Medetomidine (Pfizer), midazolam (Roche), fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag), and antagonists –
atipamezol (Pfizer), flumazenil and naloxon (Delta Select) – were used according to the 
regulations of the local authorities
Intravital microscopy of thrombus formation in FeCl

-injured mesenteric arterioles
Four week old mice were anesthetized, and the mesentery was exteriorized through a 
midline abdominal incision.6 Arterioles were visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted 
microscope (10x/0.3 NA objective, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 100-W HBO fluorescent lamp 
source, and a CoolSNAP-EZ camera (Visitron). Digital images were recorded and analysed 
off-line using Metavue software. Injury was induced by topical application of a 3-mm² filter 
paper saturated with FeCl
3
(20%). Adhesion and aggregation of fluorescently labelled 
platelets (Dylight-488–conjugated anti-GPIX Ig derivative) in arterioles were monitored for 
40 min or until complete occlusion occurred (blood flow ceased for >1 min).
tMCA occlusion model
Experiments were conducted on 8-10 weeks-old mice according to previously published 
recommendations for research in mechanism-driven basic stroke studies.7 tMCAO was 
induced under inhalation anesthesia using the intraluminal filament (Doccol Company) 
technique.8 After 60 min, the filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. For measurements 
of ischemic brain volume, animals were sacrificed 24 h after induction of tMCAO, and brain 
sections were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich). Brain 
infarct volumes were calculated and corrected for edema.8 Neurological function and motor 
function were assessed by two independent and blinded investigators 24 h after tMCAO, as 
previously described.8 The experiments were conducted according to the recommendations 
for research in experimental stroke studies and the current ARRIVE guidelines 
(http://www.nc3rs.org/ARRIVE).7
Assessment of infarction and hemorrhage by MRI
MRI was performed 24 hours after transient ischemia on a 1.5 T unit (Vision; Siemens) under 
inhalation anesthesia. A custom-made dual-channel surface coil was used for all 
measurements (A063HACG; Rapid Biomedical). The MR protocol included a coronal T2-
weighted sequence (slice thickness, 2 mm) and a coronal T2-weighted gradient-echo
constructed interference in steady state (CISS) sequence (slice thickness, 1 mm). MR 
images were transferred to an external workstation (Leonardo; Siemens) for data processing. 
The visual analysis of infarct morphology and the search for eventual intracerebral 
hemorrhage were performed in a blinded manner. Infarct volumes were calculated by 
planimetry of hyperintense areas on high-resolution CISS images.
Bleeding time
Mice were anesthetized and a 2 mm segment of the tail tip was removed with a scalpel. Tail 
bleeding was monitored by gently absorbing blood with a filter paper at 20 s intervals without 
making contact with the wound site. When no blood was observed on the paper, bleeding 
was determined to have ceased. Experiments were stopped after 20 min.

Statistics
Results are presented as means ± SD or scatter blots. Data were tested for Gaussian 
distribution with the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test and then analysed using
the Welch’s test. Non-parametric data was assessed by Mann Whitney U test. Differences 
between more than two groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
with Dunnetts T3 as post-hoc test or with the Kruskal Wallis test. For statistical analysis 
SPSS Statistics 20 and PrismGraph 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used. 
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
