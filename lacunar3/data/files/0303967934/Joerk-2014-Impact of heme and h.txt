Diameter in Mouse Visual Cortex

Background-—Delayed cerebral vasospasm is the most common cause of mortality and severe neurological impairment in patients
who survive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite improvements in the field of diagnostic imaging, options for prevention and
medical treatment—primarily with the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine or hemodynamic manipulations—are insufficient.
Previous studies have suggested that heme and bilirubin oxidation end products, originating from degraded hemoglobin around
ruptured blood vessels, are involved in the development of vasospasm by inhibiting large conductance BK
Ca
potassium channels in
vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study, we identify individual heme degradation products regulating arteriolar diameter in
dependence of BK
Ca
channel activity.
Methods and Results-—Using differential interference contrast video microscopy in acute brain slices, we determined diameter
changes of intracerebral arterioles in mouse visual cortex. In preconstricted vessels, the specificBK
Ca
channel blockers paxilline
and iberiotoxin as well as iron-containing hemin caused vasoconstriction. In addition, the bilirubin oxidation end product Z-BOX A
showed a stronger vasoconstrictive potency than its regio-isomer Z-BOX B. Importantly, Z-BOX A had the same vasoconstrictive
effect, independent of its origin from oxidative degradation or chemical synthesis. Finally, in slices of Slo1-deficient knockout mice,
paxilline and Z-BOX A remained ineffective in changing arteriole diameter.
Conclusions-—We identified individual components of the oxidative bilirubin degradation that led to vasoconstriction of cerebral
arterioles. The vasoconstrictive effect of Z-BOX A and Z-BOX B was mediated by BK
Ca
channel activity that might represent a
signaling pathway in the occurrence of delayed cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. (J Am Heart Assoc.

S ubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe acute disease
caused primarily by rupture of an intracranial aneurysm
with edema and bleeding into the basal cisterns of the brain.
Before receiving medical attention, the mortality rate exceeds
12% immediately after this hemorrhagic subtype of stroke.1
Due to a substantial deterioration of brain function, another
25% of patients die within 24 hours. The remaining survivors
often suffered a posthemorrhagic vasospasm of cerebral
blood vessels, typically occurring 3 to 9 days after the initial
event.2,3 Symptomatic vasospasm, referred to as “delayed
ischemic neurological deficit” (DIND), plays a decisive role of
secondary ischemic stroke in more than one-third of post-SAH
patients and is characterized by an impaired neurocognitive
outcome through long-lasting luminal narrowing of arterial
vessels including smaller arterioles. Although the precise
pathophysiological mechanism of occlusion remains vague,
there is a growing body of evidence that heme and heme
degradation products, subsequently liberated from perivascular
hematoma, act as major contributors in the development of
delayed cerebral vasospasm.4–8 Besides products of the
oxidative degradation of bilirubin and biliverdin detected in
cerebrospinal fluid of post-SAH patients who develop vasospasm
,6 the intracranial hemorrhage triggers an inflammatory
response including invasion of macrophages and white blood
cells that excite expression of heme oxygenase-1 protein.7,9
This inducible enzymatic isoform metabolizes heme to biliverdin
, carbon monoxide, and iron. Biliverdin itself is converted to
bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Previous studies have shown
that bilirubin does not cause a vasospastic-like increase of
vascular tone.5 However, free iron released by heme

degradation can react with hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl
free radicals acting on hemoglobin breakdown products to
generate bilirubin oxidation end products (BOXes).7,8 The
equilibrium between vasoconstriction and vasodilation in
response to blood pressure and neuronal activity is, under
physiological conditions, regulated by large-conductance calcium-
and voltage-gated Slo1 potassium channels (BK
Ca
)
located in the plasma membrane of vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs). Both the global rise in intracellular calcium
concentration ([Ca2+]
i
), mediated by voltage-dependent calcium
channels, and the localized intracellular calcium release,
accomplished by inositol trisphosphate receptors and ryanodine
receptors in the sarcoplasmatic reticulum membrane,
results in BK
Ca
channel opening.10 The subsequent potassium
efflux leads to membrane hyperpolarization, promoting closure
of voltage-dependent calcium channels and thus antagonizing
myogenic tone. The sequence analysis of the channel protein
identified a long carboxyl extension, assembled with regulatory
domains that allow the intracellular sensing across a wide
variety of potential ligands including lipids, gaseous molecules,
reactive oxygen species, or the inhibitory scorpion venoms
iberiotoxin (IbTX) and charybdotoxin.11 The link between the
vasoconstrictive potency of BOXes and the considerable
relevance of Slo1 BK
Ca
channels in the regulation of vascular
tone supported the idea that BOXes may influence the gating
properties of this potassium channel. Hou et al recently
obtained evidence that BOXes decrease the current amplitude
and frequency of BK
Ca
channel opening by binding to the lysinecontaining
linker segment located downstream of the transmembrane
domain.12In addition, Tang et al demonstrated that
heme (Fe2+) and hemin (Fe3+ chloroprotoporphyrin IX) directly
reduced the potassium current and decreased the duration of
channel opening via heme-binding motif.13 Apart from large
artery vasospasm, the role of brain parenchymal and pial
arterioles in the development of DIND is less well investigated.
Using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, Friedrich et al have
proven that SAH, induced in C57/BL6 mice by endovascular
perforation, resulted in microthrombosis and vasoconstriction
of pial arterioles.14
The aim of our study was to quantify the vasoactive
potency of different compounds of heme degradation products
on cerebral parenchymal arterioles. Using an in vitro
model system, we characterized changes in arteriolar diameter
in acute brain slices of wild type and Slo1-deficient
(Slo1/) mice.

obtained from a TKA MicroPure system (Thermo Electron).
Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry
UPLC analysis was carried out using an Acquity UPLC (Waters
Corp) equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column
(1.7 lm, 10092.1 mm). A multistep gradient (solvent A: 0.1%
aqueous formic acid containing 2% acetonitrile; solvent B:
acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid) was applied with a
constant flow rate of 400 lL/min (0 to 0.5 minute: 100%
solvent A; 0.50 to 1.50 minutes: 0 to 19% solvent B; 1.50 to

19.5 to 100% solvent B; 6.25 to 8.25 minutes: 100% solvent B
followed by reequilibration to 100% solvent A). Mass spectra
were recorded online on a Waters Micromass Q-ToF Micro
mass spectrometer measuring with electrospray ionization in
positive-ion mode. Preparative HPLC was performed on a
Shimadzu LC-8A using a C18 HTec column (5 lm,
2509 16 mm; Macherey–Nagel) and an SPD-10AV UV-VIS
detector measuring at a wavelength of 310 nm. The HPLC-
tandem mass spectrometry method is currently unpublished.
Preparation of Bilirubin Oxidation End Products
With the exception of the synthetic variant of the Z-isomer of
BOX A (Z-BOX A syn), all BOX-containing compounds were
prepared by the nonenzymatic oxidative degradation of
bilirubin (Figure 3A), modified after Wurster et al.15 Protected
from light, 1 g of bilirubin was dissolved in 500 mL of 5 mol/
L sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture was adjusted with
11 mol/L HCl to pH 7.5, and 50% hydrogen peroxide solution
was added to a final concentration of 10% by volume. After
incubation at room temperature for 48 hours, the yellowish
solution was frozen in a bath of liquid nitrogen and freezedried
to produce the solid crude oxidation product (BOX salt).
To prepare BOX extract, the yellowish BOX salt was
thoroughly triturated and extracted with 1 L of chloroform.
The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. In order to
prepare the pure isomers Z-BOX A and Z-BOX B, the extract
was suspended and vortex mixed in acetonitrile/water (20/
80 v/v). For purification, aliquots of the supernatant were

separated by preparative reversed-phase HPLC with an
isocratic eluent system of acetonitrile/water (20/80 v/v).
The manually collected fractions were concentrated to
dryness under reduced pressure to obtain the pure solid
substances Z-BOX A and Z-BOX B. For short-term storage, all
BOX-containing preparations were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution and were aliquoted into sample
tubes prior to freezing at 20°C. The selective synthesis of
the Z-isomer of BOX A was prepared starting from 3-bromo-4-
methylfuran-2,5-dione.16
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the University of
Jena and were in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Experiments were done on acute brain slices from randomly
assigned wild-type C57BL/6J mice at postnatal day 16 to 18
and Slo1 knockout (Slo1/) mice at postnatal day 16 to
25. Knockout animals were genotyped in the first postnatal
week and had a mixed genetic background of FVB and
C57BL/6J.
Brain Slice Preparation
After euthanizing under deep isoflurane anesthesia, animals
were decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and
transferred into 4°C aCSF containing the following composition

and adjusted at pH 7.4. Subsequently, 350-lm-thick coronal
brain slices, comprising occipital and parietal cortex, were cut
using a vibrotome (Leica VT 1200S) and subsequently stored
for at least 60 minutes and up to a maximum of 90 minutes

), at pH

of the microscope and continuously perfused with aCSF at 32
to 34°C( flow rate 4 to 5 mL/min).
Optical Imaging
All experiments were performed using near-infrared differential
interference contrast video microscopy (Eclipse FN1;
Nikon Instruments) in combination with a Rolera XR camera
(QImaging) driven by the software StreamPix 5 (NorPix Inc).
Vessel Diameter
Arterioles in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex and
perpendicular to the cortical surface were selected as
structures of interest (Figure 1B). Arterioles differed from
venules by their sinuous morphology with visible vascular
myocytes and a wall thickness of at least 4 lm. Only vessels
with a stable diameter and an intraluminal range of 18 to
30 lm were considered. Medium arteriolar internal diameter
was calculated as the area between opposite vessel walls
along a length of 50 lm centered around the zone of maximal
vascular reaction (Figure 1C). Changes in luminal width were
determined by measuring the number of pixels inside this area
and were analyzed offline using images acquired at the same
field of view every minute. Pixel calibration was carried out by
ascertainment of the number of pixels per micrometer. To
mimic the myogenic tone, caused by blood pressure in vivo,
arterioles were preconstricted by administration of the NO
synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME for 20 minutes before
administering BK
Ca
channel inhibitors (Paxilline, IbTX) and
before heme and heme degradation products began. To
prepare nimodipine solution, the nimodipine salt was dispersed
and vortex mixed in aCSF containing 100 lmol/L
L-NAME at pH 7.4. Separately for each brain slice, vasoactive
substances were dissolved acutely in the prewarmed aCSF
control solution.
Data Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Data were gathered and evaluated using ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health), Microsoft Excel, and OriginPro 8 (Origin-
Lab). Because Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests indicated that data
followed normal distribution, statistical analyses were determined
using 1-way ANOVA with the Tukey test as post hoc
analysis or Student t test. The parameter “n” represents the
number of brain slices tested. Because only 1 arteriole per slice
was always monitored, “n” also represents the number of
arterioles. All values are presented as meanSD. A value of
P≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Paxilline or Iberiotoxin Application Remain
Ineffective on Vessel Diameter Change of
Nonpreconstricted Arterioles
In afirst set of experiments, we tested the stability of arteriole
diameter in acute brain slices of mouse visual cortex during
control conditions. In the absence of any drug administration
and during 60 minutes of perfusion with aCSF control
solution, no significant change in vessel diameter compared
with baseline (1.61.8%; n=5 from 4 animals; P=0.11; 1-
sample t test; Figure 1D) and no change in vessel wall width
(data not shown) were observed. We conclude that, in our
hands, video microscopy of arterioles in acute brain slices is a
stable model system and, therefore, is suitable for quantifying
changes in arteriolar diameter in vitro up to 6 hours.

To understand the influence of the BK
Ca
channel function in
the development of delayed cerebral vasospasm, we tested the
vasoactive effects of the selective BK
Ca
channel inhibitors
paxilline and IbTX on the resting diameter of arterioles in our
brain slice model. Compared with aCSF control condition,
application of paxilline (1.5 lmol/L) did not result in any
significant diameter change (31.1%; n=5 from 4 animals;
P=0.62; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 1D). In line, the application of
IbTX (50 nmol/L) induced no significant change in vessel
diameter after 60 minutes compared with baseline (0.21.4%;

n=5 from 3 animals; P=0.56: 1-way ANOVA; Figure 1D).
Furthermore, the diameters of the paxilline and IbTX group
were not statistically different (P=0.05). Collectively, these
initial experiments demonstrated that the specific inhibition of
BK
Ca
channels did not alter vessel diameter significantly in
nonpreconstricted intracerebral arterioles.
NO Synthase Inhibitor L-NAME Causes Increase
in Arteriolar Tone
Our in vitro model is lacking intravascular blood pressure;
therefore, in the absence of intact brain metabolism that
includes blood flow autoregulation, the arterioles become
relaxed. To mimic the myogenic tone of arterioles in vivo, we
bath-applied L-NAME to prevent the generation of NO as one
crucial vasodilative mediator. Antagonizing the NO-dependent
signaling cascade, the application of L-NAME
(100 lmol/L) constricted intracortical arterioles significantly
by 6.81.7% (n=6 from 5 animals; P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA),
and the vessel diameter reached a stable baseline 15 minutes
after the wash-in (Figure 1E). Furthermore, experiments
lasting 100 minutes confirmed the long-term stable vasoconstrictive
effect of the NOS inhibitor (data not shown).
Therefore, we concluded that the L-NAME-induced preconstriction
is suitable for quantification of the vasoactive
potency of BK
Ca
channel-specific compounds, as described
below. The NOS antagonist L-NAME also resulted in narrowing
of the vascular lumen in the presence of tetrodotoxin
(TTX) (0.5 lmol/L; n=5 from 4 animals; Figure 1H). This
vasoconstrictive response was in the same order of magnitude
as the preconstriction without TTX (P=0.27; 1-way
ANOVA; Figure 1H). These data support the idea that the
pretreatment of brain vessels with L-NAME increases vascular
tone independent of voltage-sensitive sodium channel
activity (eg, due to neuronal network activity).
Paxilline and Iberiotoxin Induce Vasoconstriction
of Arterioles Pretreated With L-NAME
A substantial body of evidence had demonstrated that BK
Ca
channels in astrocytic endfeet and VSMCs are involved in
vasoregulation evoked by electrical field stimulation as well
as under resting conditions.17–19 If activated BK
Ca
channels
in VSMCs oppose vasoconstriction by membrane hyperpolarization
in response to the increase in [Ca2+]
i
following LNAME
application, BK
Ca
channel inhibition should lead to
VSMC membrane depolarization and hypertension. To investigate
this hypothesis, we repeated our pharmacological
experiments with the specific BK 
Ca
channel inhibitors by
monitoring diameter changes on preconstricted vessels:
20 minutes after beginning the L-NAME incubation, we
started the additional application of paxilline (1.5 lmol/L)
or IbTX (50 nmol/L) for 60 minutes each. In contrast to the
L-NAME application without previous preconstriction, paxilline
(19.6 2.2%; n=6 from 5 animals; P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA;
Figure 1F) and IbTX (23.61.4%; n=5 from 5 animals;
P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 1F) induced prominent
vasoconstriction without reaching a baseline. However, the
diameter decrease in the paxilline group did not differ
significantly from the IbTX group (P=0.65; Figure 1I). To test
whether various types of arterioles show different ability to
react, we compared the paxilline-induced decrease in
diameter of intracortical arterioles in layer 2/3 with the
responsiveness of pial arterioles located at the brain surface
embedded in arachnoid membrane (n=5 from 4 animals).
Interestingly, paxilline application induced a 4.81.6% vasoconstriction
in pial arterioles that was significantly smaller
than the vasoconstriction of layer 2/3 arterioles (P<0.001, 1-
way ANOVA; Figure 1G). In addition, application of TTX
(0.5 lmol/L) did not change the paxilline-dependent vasoconstriction
in layer 2/3 arterioles significantly (n=5 from 4

animals; P=0.27; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 1H). Taking these
observations into consideration, we argue that the longlasting
vasospastic effect of paxilline is location dependent
and appears to be independent of voltage-gated sodium
channel function.
Hemin Acts as Specific Vasoconstrictor in
Preconstricted Arterioles
To further evaluate the specificity and the potential contribution
of heme to delayed vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage,
we tested the vasoactivity of 3 types of metalloprotoporphyrin
IX: Zn2+-PP, Cu2+-PP, and hemin. In case of arterioles not
pretreated with L-NAME, a 60-minute application of hemin (1
lmol/L) resulted in a small vasoconstriction of 1.21.9% (n=6
from 4 animals; P<0.05; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 2A) in comparison
to the aCSF control group. Application of Cu2+-PP
(1 lmol/L) led to no significant change in vessel diameter
compared with control conditions (1.40.9%; n=5 from 3
animals;P=1; 1-way ANOVA; data not shown). In contrast, Zn2+-
PP (1 lmol/L) induced a prominent increase in diameter up to
12.2  1.8% (n=5 from 3 animals; P<0.001). Arteriolar
preconstriction with L-NAME converted the hemin-induced
small vasoconstriction into a progressive and significant
diameter decrease of 9.91.2% after 60 minutes (n=5 from 5
animals;P<0.001; Figure 2A and 2C). Different from hemin, the
vasoconstrictive effect on arteriolar diameter failed to appear in
preconstricted vessels after bath application of Cu2+-PP
(0.71.5%; n=6 from 5 animals; P=1; Figure 2B and 2C) or
Zn2+-PP (1.01.0%; n=5 from 4 animals; P=1; Figure 2B and
2C). Thefinding that iron-containing protoporphyrin acted as a
specific vasoconstrictor in preconstricted arterioles supports
the assumption that the iron center of hemin or its charge
determines its ability to alter vascular tone.13,20
BOX-Containing Mixtures and BOX Isomers
Decrease Arteriolar Diameter
The concentration increase of BOXes surrounding perivascular
hematoma in post-SAH patients and the presence of free
radicals from inflammatory cell metabolism are considered to
be major mediators of vasospasm induction.5,7 In a subset of
experiments on preconstricted arterioles, we examined the
vasoactivity of BOX-containing preparations of the oxidative
bilirubin degradation process4 and the purified isomers Z-BOX
A and Z-BOX B (Figure 3A). BOX salt, the crude mixture of the
oxidative in vitro degradation of bilirubin, dissolved in L-NAME-
containing aCSF solution at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL,
caused significant vasoconstriction of 11.93.0% in preconstricted
arterioles (n=6 from 6 animals; P<0.001; 1-way
ANOVA; Figure 4D). Ultraviolet light–exposed BOX salt solution
(254 nm for 5 hours) was not effective in inducing
vasoconstriction and converted the response to a nonsignificant
increase in vascular diameter (5.83.5%; n=5 from 5
animals; P=0.14; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 4D), confirming that
BOXes lose their biological activity by isomerization or
degradation after illumination in the ultraviolet range.12,15 In
a next step of compound purification, we determined changes

in arteriolar diameter after application of BOX extract
(0.03 mg/mL), generated from the dried chloroform extract
of the salt mixture. BOX extract induced a substantial decrease
in vessel diameter by 31.5  9.4% (n=5 from 4 animals;
P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 4D) within 15 minutes. A 30-
minute-long washout of BOX extract did not lead to any
significant change in vessel diameter (31.5% to 28.4%
compared with baseline; n=5 from 4 animals), indicating the
long-lasting vasospastic effect of oxidized species of bilirubin.
To evaluate the vasoactive impact of single isomers obtained
from oxidative bilirubin degradation, we bath-applied 5 lmol/L
of the purified isomers Z-BOX A or Z-BOX B (referred to as “ZBOX
A deg”and“Z-BOX B deg,”respectively), which differ from
each other only by the switched positions of their vinyl and
methyl groups (Figure 3B). Z-BOX A deg affected the diameter
of preconstricted arterioles significantly by 10.00.9% vasoconstriction
(n=5 from 4 animals; P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA). In
contrast, Z-BOX B deg at the same concentration induced
smaller vasoconstriction of 4.42.2% (n=6 from 4 animals),
which was not significantly different compared with the LNAME
control group (P=0.57; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 4A). To
exclude an epiphenomenon caused by contaminants from the
degradation of bilirubin, we investigated whether synthetically
generated Z-BOX A provokes constrictive vascular effects
similar to those that occurred after application of Z-BOX A deg
obtained from oxidative bilirubin degradation. To verify the
identical structure of Z-BOX A isomers in these preparations,
we analyzed the compounds with nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and compared the purity and content of the
isomer postexperimentally with UPLC coupled to mass spectrometry
(Figure 3C through 3E). Corresponding to these
aspects, both preparations were chemically equivalent. No
significant differences were found, indicating that a relevant
product from bilirubin degradation is Z-BOX A. The application
of synthetic Z-BOX A (5 lmol/L) resulted in a significant
continuous narrowing of the arteriolar lumen (8.13.8%; n=6

period, the amplitude of vasoconstriction did not differ
significantly from the results obtained with Z-BOX A deg
(P=1; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 4B and 4D). To quantify the
stability ofZ-BOX A syn during the experiment, we used HPLC–
tandem mass spectrometry analysis and determined the
relative concentration of Z-BOX A syn in samples of aCSF
solution before and after the experiments. The results show no
significant degradation of Z-BOX A syn during the experiment
(97.410.6% of original concentration; t test; P=0.81; n=7).
Currently, nimodipine is the primary pharmacological
intervention recommended as prophylaxis against cerebral
vasospasm.21 To investigate the vasoactivity of the potent L-
type calcium channel inhibitor, we bath-applied 1 mmol/L
nimodipine on preconstricted arterioles. After 30 minutes,
vessel diameter increased up to 1040.5% in comparison to
the baseline level (n=5 from 5 animals; Figure 4C). The
additional application of Z-BOX A deg (5 lmol/L) reversed
the small vasodilation in a significant vasoconstriction to
931.9% (n=5 from 5 animals; P<0.001; 1-way ANOVA;
Figure 4C) of the initial diameter.

provided by Toshinori Hoshi, Philadelphia, PA). Under control
conditions, all arterioles (n
slices
=20; n
animals
=11) selected for
diameter analysis showed an increased vascular tone after
preincubation with L-NAME, indicated by significantly thicker
vessel wall and smaller vessel diameter (P<0.01; data not
shown). In contrast to the series of experiments in C57BL/6J
mice, in brain slices of Slo1/ mice, no significant diameter
change could be observed with application of paxilline
(1.5 lmol/L) for more than 60 minutes. The weak vasoconstriction
of 1.40.9% did not differ significantly from the
L-NAME control group (n=5 from 3 animals; P=0.7; 1-way-
ANOVA; Figure 5B and 5E). To reinforce this result, we
bath-applied Z-BOX A deg (5 lmol/L) and, again, did not
observe any significant diameter change in preconstricted
arterioles in slices of Slo1/ animals (0.21.4%; n=5 from 2
animals; P=0.63; 1-way ANOVA; Figure 5C and 5E). Finally,
we examined whether synthetic Z-BOX A has an impact on
arteriolar vessel diameter in brain slices of Slo1/ animals.
In line with the results using Z-BOX A deg, Z-BOX A syn failed
to induce vasoconstriction in comparison to the L-NAME
control group (0.61.4%; n=5 from 4 animals; P=0.37; 1-way
ANOVA; Figure 5D and 5E). We conclude that the vasoconstrictive
potency of paxilline as well as Z-BOX A depend on the
presence of BK
Ca
potassium channels.
Our data demonstrate for the first time that individual
heme degradation products cause significant vasoconstriction
in cerebral arterioles that is mediated by BK
Ca
channel
activity but that, at the same time, differ in their vasoactive
potency.
Discussion
Delayed cerebral vasospasm causing death or severe neurological
deficits is one of the major complications in patients
who survive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Previous studies
suggest that the products of oxidative hemoglobin degradation
might be responsible for the irreversible vasoconstriction. So
far, only mixtures of bilirubin degradation products have been
tested in animal models for their vasoactive propensity. Using
an in vitro model of cerebral vasodiameter, a central finding of
this study is that heme alone and individual heme degradation
products including different BOXes species induce long-lasting
vasoconstriction in cerebral arterioles. The vasoconstrictive
effect was detected only if arterioles were preconstricted using
the NOS inhibitor L-NAME. Because arterioles become relaxed
in brain slices missing intravascular blood pressure and
autoregulation, this pharmacological pretreatment enabled us
to simulate the physiological resting tone present in vivo. The LNAME–based preconstriction is in line with the hypothesis that,
under physiological conditions, the resting tone activates
stretch-activated cation channels in VSMCs that are counteracted
by BK
Ca
channel activation.23,24 Inhibition of BK
Ca
channel conductivity by heme or BOXes would lead to more
depolarized membrane potentials and, therefore, would induce
further smooth muscle cell contraction. Besides thromboxane
A2 receptor agonists (eg, U46619) or prostaglandin F2a,
various studies have used L-NAME as an agent for simulation
and perpetuation of vascular tone.25–27 Preincubation of brain
slices with the unspecific NOS inhibitor L-NAME increases
[Ca2+]
i
in VSMCs by both the decrease of basal NO release by
inhibition the constitutive neuronal NOS28 and by the downregulation
of protein kinase G signaling pathways.29 Under
physiological conditions, protein kinase G induces activation of
myosin light chain phosphatase,30 inhibits calcium release
from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum mediated by inositol
trisphosphate receptors,31 and increases the cellular potassium
efflux by BK
Ca
channel phosphorylation.32 In our hands,
after antagonizing these NO-related vasodilative mechanisms,
arteriole diameter decreased to near 90% of the initial diameter
in vitro (Figure 1E). Consequently, this partial vasoconstriction
would allow the detection of an additional decrease as well as
of an increase in arteriolar diameter due to any additional
pharmacological application.
In accordance with the postulated molecular mechanism of
blocking BK
Ca
channel conductance by hemoglobin degradation
products, similar effects could be obtained by application
of the specific BK 
Ca
channel blockers IbTX or paxilline.
Suppression of potassium efflux owing to blockade Slo1 S6
helix in case of paxilline,33 binding the outer vestibule of the
channel pore by IbTX,34 or interaction with the linker
sequence between S6 helix and the RCK1 domain in the
case of BOXes are not supposed to restrict the open
probability of voltage-dependent calcium channels and,
therefore, would increase global [Ca2+]
i
mediated on membrane
depolarization.
Even though pial and intraparenchymal vessels possess
structural and functional similarities, the paxilline-induced
diameter decrease in arterioles located at the pial surface was
significantly lower than in arterioles of equal size located at
the transition to layer 2/3 at a cortical depth of roughly
150 lm (Figure 1G and 1I). At first glance, this finding
supports the hypothesis that the interaction of vascular
muscle cells with the perivascular neuronal network explains
the different vasoreactivity because, different from pial
vessels, intraparenchymal arterioles and encircling astrocytic
endfeet form a neurovascular unit.18,25,35 This assumption
was challenged because the vasoconstrictive effect of paxilline
was still present after application of the sodium channel
blocker TTX and, therefore, was independent of neuronal activity
(Figure 1H). In addition, it has been shown previously that
intraparenchymal arterioles generate a significantly stronger
pressure-induced myogenic tone than pial arterioles.36

iological measurements in muscle cells of arterioles in layer
2/3 demonstrated stronger depolarization with higher [Ca2+]
i
than VSMCs of arterioles at the brain surface.37 Further
investigations are required to determine whether the locationdependent
effect of paxilline results in different BK
Ca
densities
along arterial vascular segments.
To identify individual compounds of hemoglobin degradation
products, we first examined the impact of 3 metal
protoporphyrins on arteriolar diameter. In accordance with
previous investigations from Tang et al, who have shown the
inhibitory action of hemin on BK
Ca
channel current amplitude
,13 bath application of hemin caused progressive diameter
decrease in preconstricted arterioles (Figure 2A),
whereas Zn2+ protoporphyrin and Cu2+ protoporphyrin did
not alter the width of arterioles. The hemin-specific regulation
of BK
Ca
channel function is primarily mediated by the CKACH
binding motif located between the intracellular RCK domains.
Consequently, mutations of cysteine and histidine residues in
the sequence CKACH eliminated the hemin sensitivity of BK
Ca
channels.13,38 Further investigations revealed that heminmediated
inhibition of BK
Ca
channels correlates with the
increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.20 These characteristics
provide a possible explanation of why L-NAME
preincubation of brain slices and subsequent inhibition of
PKG signal pathways strengthen the vasoconstrictive effect of
hemin.
To trace back the vasoconstrictive activity of heme and
heme degradation products to single chemical compounds,
we tested three different preparations of BOXes in our in vitro
model. The unpurified freeze-dried crude bilirubin oxidation
mixture, BOX salt, consists (aside from small amounts of ZBOX
A and Z-BOX B) of numerous inorganic and organic
compounds that might feature vasoactive potential. The
observed vasoconstrictive effect of BOX salt can result from
the additive or subtractive effects of single vasoactive
compounds or due to synergistic interplays. In particular,
traces of peroxides—that remain in the freeze-drying step of
oxidative bilirubin degradation—can directly influence the
vascular diameter by acting as substrates of signaling
cascades or via modulation of redox states that switch or
interrupt signaling pathways. The loss of vasoconstrictive
properties after ultraviolet irradiation of BOX salt is controversial.
Following the recent findings that, like bilirubin,
particular products from bilirubin breakdown are able to
undergo photoisomerization,14 light-induced structural
changes in the conformation of double bonds of vasoactive
compounds seem possible. This would lead to a decrease in
the primary compounds and would explain the mitigation of
the vasoconstrictive effect.
The very strong vasoconstrictive effect observed after
application of BOX salt’s contained nonpolar substances (BOX
extract) is in line with the concentration increase of vasoactive
compounds due to the extraction with chloroform. In both
HPLC-purified single-compound treatments, Z-BOX A and
Z-BOX B, peroxide activity could not be detected.
Z-BOX A, purified from oxidative bilirubin degradation,
showed a vasoconstrictive effect similar to that of hemin.
Interestingly, the vasoconstrictive potency of the regio-isomer
Z-BOX B was significantly weaker. Although the time course of
vasoconstriction after Z-BOX B administration was slower at
first compared with the time course of Z-BOX A–induced
vasoconstriction, we cannot exclude that, for longer administration
times, both compounds would cause similar effects.
Whether both isomers aggregate their vasoconstrictive effects
or behave competitively must be the subject of future studies.
Nevertheless, because the potential binding site for both
isomers is supposed to be equivalent, the difference in
vasoactive effect could be a starting point for the development
of a chemical compound that occupies the binding site
at the BK
Ca
channel without having the inhibitory effect of
different BOXes species.
Besides “triple-H therapy” and the clinical management of
intracranial pressure, treatment with the calcium channel
antagonist nimodipine is the main approved pharmacological
intervention for patients suffering from cerebral hemorrhage.21 Although sound data indicating a significant benefit
of this treatment are still missing, no alternative therapy
based on direct modulation of ion channel activity is available.
In accordance, application of nimodipine in our in vitro model
did not prevent the vasoconstrictive effect of Z-BOX A.
Although nimodipine alone already showed vasodilatative
potency, the additional application of Z-BOX A yielded similar
relative vasoconstriction compared with control.
To exclude potential contamination of purified Z-BOX A
originated from oxidative degradation with unknown vasoactive
compounds, we synthesized Z-BOX A with chemical
means from scratch (Z-BOX A syn).16 Both batches of Z-BOX
A, one originated from oxidative degradation the other from
chemical synthesis, showed similar vasoconstrictive effects.
Consequently, we can exclude contamination of Z-BOX A
originated from the degradation process with unknown
vasoactive compounds from responsibility for the observed
vasoconstrictive effect of Z-BOX A.
To pinpoint the vasoconstrictive effect of Z-BOX A on its
postulated molecular target, the inhibition of BK
Ca
channel
conductivity, we applied paxilline and Z-BOX A to acute brain
slices of mice lacking the BK
Ca
channela-subunits. Before the
pharmacological incubation began, the morphometric analyses
of vessels showed that the inner and outer diameters of
intracortical arterioles were already statistically significantly
smaller than the arteriolar diameter of C57BL6/J mice (data
not shown). These observations support the idea that the
decrease in diameter of intracortical arterioles reflects the
loss of hyperpolarized potassium efflux in VSMCs. In line with

this hypothesis, previous studies found that Slo1/ mice
had higher systemic blood pressure than Slo1+/+ mice due to
reduced frequencies in spontaneous transient outward potassium
currents in vascular muscle cells39 and hyperaldosteronism.40 Neither the administration of paxilline nor the
administration of Z-BOX A induced any significant change in
arteriole diameter compared with baseline in slices of Slo1-
deficient mice. In addition, this was true for both Z-BOX A
types, whether originated from oxidative bilirubin degradation
or chemical synthesis. Consequently, we conclude that the
vasoconstrictive effect of Z-BOX A is mediated by a change in
BK
Ca
channel conductivity.
In conclusion, we identified individual components of the
oxidative bilirubin degradation process that lead to vasoconstriction
of cerebral arterioles mediated by BK
Ca
channel
activity. Although the confirmation of our data by an in vivo
SAH model is still missing and the means by which heme and
heme degradation products get into the cortex after SAH is
unclear, the vasoconstrictive effect might represent a
signaling pathway in the occurrence of delayed cerebral
vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. In addition,
the different vasoactive potency of the regio-isomers Z-BOX A
and Z-BOX B on intracortical arterioles has not been
documented previously and improves understanding of the
pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
