SUMMARY
Aims: Disturbance of the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion has been implicated
in cerebral ischemia and several neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we attempted to investigate
the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key mitochondrial fission protein, in the
pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Methods: Using Drp1 siRNA or Mdivi-1, a small molecule
inhibitor of Drp1, we examined the effect of Drp1 knockdown or inhibition on oxygenglucose
deprivation (OGD)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and death of SH-SY-5Y cells.
Cell death and viability were evaluated with LDH and MTT assays, respectively, and mitochondrial
morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm), and ATP production
were assessed using epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and HPLC, respectively.
Moreover, to examine the effect of Drp1 inhibition on ischemic brain injury, middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) mice were injected (i.p.) with Mdivi1, and blood–brain barrier
permeability, brain water content, and cell apoptosis were assessed. Results:
Knockdown or inhibition of Drp1 by Mdivi-1 significantly attenuated OGD-induced cell
death in SH-SY-5Y cells, associated with reduced morphological change of mitochondria
and attenuated Bax insertion,oligomerization. Moreover, treatment of the MCAO mice
with Mdivi-1 remarkably reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in a dosedependent
manner, associated with marked reduction of mitochondrial fragmentation and
BAX expression.Conclusions: Down-regulation or inhibition of Drp1 may reduce cerebral
ischemic damage through maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and function,
and decreasing Bax insertion and oligomerization in mitochondria.
Introduction
Mitochondria are mobile organelles that exist in dynamic networks.
They continuously join by the process of fusion and divide
by the process of fission. These dynamic processes are essential for
synaptic functions [1–3] and are also involved in cell apoptosis
[4,5]. While mitochondrial fusion is mediated in part by the outer
membrane dynamin-like GTPases mitofusin-1 and -2 (Mfn1 and
Mfn2) and by the inner membrane optic atrophy protein (Opa1)
[6,7], the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) plays a role in
mitochondrial fragmentation through conjugating with other
outer membrane proteins, such as hFis1 [8]. It has been reported
that an enhanced Drp1 GTPase activity is associated with
detrimental mitochondrial fragmentation in the process of either
acute or chronic neuronal death. For instance, in Huntington’s
disease, mutant huntingtin (HTT) plays a role in dramatic mitochondrial
fragmentation possibly through interacting with Drp1
and thereby enhancing its enzymatic activity. Expression of a
dominant-negative mutant of Drp1 (Drp1-K38A) has been shown
to prevent neuronal apoptosis [9]. Based on the recent findings, it
was observed that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or glutamate
promoted Drp1 translocation to mitochondria, and inhibition
of Drp1 prevented morphological changes of mitochondria
and the subsequent cell death [10], it is hypothesized that Drp1-
dependent mitochondrial fission may be closely associated with
mitochondrial apoptotic pathways [11–13] and that inhibition of

Drp1 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for neurological
diseases. Although the underlying mechanisms remains
incompletely understood, increasing lines of evidence indicate
that Drp1 stimulates Bax oligomerization and cytochrome c
release [14,15], which are essential for mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization and the release of apoptotic factors.
In the present study, we attempted to explore the molecular
mechanism by which Drp1 regulates neuronal cell death and to
examine the potential therapeutic effect of Drp1 inhibition on
cerebral ischemia. By using a small molecule inhibitor of Drp1 or
knocking down the endogenous Drp1 with specific short-interference
RNA (siRNA), we observed that knockdown or inhibition of
Drp1-protected neurons against ischemic damage. This was associated
with reduced morphological and functional changes of mitochondria
, delayed Bax insertion and oligomerization, and
attenuated cytochrome c release.
Materials and methods
Animal
Male C57BL/6 mice (body weight: 18–25 g), housed in the Experimental
Animal Center, Tongji University, were used in this study.
The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of The Tenth People’s Hospital of Shanghai (Permit
number: 2011-0111).
Mdivi-1 Treatment
Mdivi-1(3-(2,4-dichloro-5-methoxyphenyl)-2-sulfanyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone
) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA) and dissolved in DMSO (100 mg/mL) as stock. Before injection
to animals, mdivi-1 was diluted in sterile saline and gently
sonicated for 30 s to produce a homogenous suspension. For cell
culture experiments, the mdivi-1 stock solution was diluted with
culture medium to various working concentrations, which were
added to cell culture 5 min before OGD procedure.
Cell Culture and Generation of Oxygen–Glucose
Deprivation (OCG) Model
The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY-5Y was maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) 37°C with 5% CO
2
. To generate OGD
cell model [16], cells were incubated with glucose-free medium in
an anaerobic chamber (Model 1025; Forma Scientific, Vernon
Hills, IL, USA) containing 85% N
2
, 10% H
2,
and 5% CO
2
(< 0.1%
O2) at 37°C. After 90 min, cells were moved out of the chamber,
and the glucose-free medium was replaced with original regular
medium, in which the cells were cultured for another 24 h in normal
CO
2
incubator for re-oxygenation.
siRNA-Mediated Drp1 Knockdown
Cells were transfected with either siRNAs against Drp1 (sequence:
siDrp1 #1 50-AAGCAGAAGAATGGGGTAAAT-30 and siDrp1 #2 50-
GGAGCCAGCTAGATATTAA-30) or a scramble-siRNA as control
using LipofectamineTM 2000. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were harvested for experiments. The knockdown of Drp1
was confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting
using a specific Drp1 antibody (dilution 1:2000; BD Biosciences
, San Jose, CA, USA).
Cell Injury and Viability Assays
Cell injury was assessed by measuring the concentration of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture medium [17]. Briefly, following
OGD and the subsequent reoxygenation, the culture medium
was removed. CytoTox 96 Cytotoxicity Assay kit was used to
measure LDH in the culture medium and in the cell lysate. Data
were presented as percentage of the maximal LDH release.
Cell viability was determined using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-
yl)- 2,5-dipenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, cells
were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 h before the medium
was removed and DMSO was added. The optical density values
were measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at the wavelengths
of 570 nm and 630 nm.
Assessment of Mitochondrial Morphology
After being transfected with Mito-DsRed and the subsequent
culturing in OGD/reoxygenation conditions as described previously
, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected
to epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Japan). The size and
shape of mitochondrial were quantified in a double-blinded
manner as previously described [18]. Briefly, the number of cells
with fragmented mitochondria was counted in 10–15 randomly
chosen 2009 microscopic fields, and the mitochondrial size and
shape were quantified using the Image J software. Mitochondrial
roundness was expressed as perimeter2/4p area, and mitochondrial
aspect ratio was calculated as a ratio of major and minor
axes.
Measurements of Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential (Dwm)
Cells were collected and stained with 50 nM tetramethylrhodaminemethyl
ester (TMRM) for 20 min at 37°C. Fluorescence signal
was detected with flow cytometry. Cells treated with 20 lM carbonyl
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone to collapse
Dwm were used set the threshold. Results were expressed as the
percentage of cells with fluorescence signal above the threshold as
previously described [18].
Measurement of ATP Production
To measure ATP production in cell culture, cells were subjected to
OGD/reoxygenation before being rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Ice-cold 0.4 M perchloric acid was then added, and cells were
scraped off. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min,
and supernatant was neutralized with 1 M K
2
CO

. Following centrifugation
, the supernatant was subjected to HPLC as described
previously [18]. To measure APT production in brain tissues, tissues
from the MCAO model were homogenized in ice-cold 0.4 M
perchloric acid, and the homogenates were centrifuged at
14,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was neutralized with 1 M

and then centrifuged. Supernatants were subjected to
HPLC as described previously.
Mitochondrial Isolation
Cells and brain tissues were fractionated using a Mitochondrial
Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, cells and brain tissues were homogenized
, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 750 g for 10 min
at 4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at
4°C, and the pellet was kept as mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant
was further centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h, and the
supernatant was kept as the cytosol fraction. Cyto c and Bax in different
fractions were detected with immunoblot analysis using
specific antibodies against cyto c or Bax (1:1000, BD bioscience,
San Jose, CA, USA).
Immunoprecipitation of Active Bax
A specific antibody against the Bax NH
2
-terminal sequence (anti-
Bax NT) was used to pull-down active Bax. Briefly, the cell lysate
containing 500 lg proteins was incubated with 1 lg anti-Bax NT
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in the presence of protein A/G
agarose beads. After wash and centrifugation, the precipitated
proteins were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Analysis of Bax Insertion and Oligomerization
After incubating the cells with 0.05% digitonin to permeabilize
the cells, mitochondrial fraction was prepared as described above.
To assess Bax insertion, the mitochondrial fraction was incubated
with 0.1 M Na
2
CO
3
for 30 min at pH 11.5, followed by centrifugation
at 100,000 g for 1 h. The pellet was used to determine the
inserted Bax, which was resistant to alkaline stripping. To assess
Bax oligomerization, the mitochondrial fraction was incubated
with 1 mM dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP) (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) for 30 min, and the cross-linked samples were
subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Temporary Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
(MCAO) Stroke Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in mice by transient occlusion
of the right MCA, using the intraluminal filament placement
technique as described previously [19,20]. Briefly, mice were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. Body temperature was kept
at 37°C. To monitor regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a laser
Doppler probe was fixed to the skull at 2 mm posterior and 4 mm
lateral to bregma and connected to a laser Doppler flow meter
(Periflux System 5000, Perimed). A filament composed of a 6-0
polydioxanone suture (PSD II, Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany)
and a silicone tip with a diameter of 225–275 mm (adapted to the
age of the animal) was inserted into the external carotid artery
and advanced into the common carotid artery. The filament was
retracted, moved into the internal carotid artery, and advanced
until the origin of the MCA, given by the sudden drop in rCBF.
After 45 min, the filament was withdrawn and reperfusion was
observed. The animals were placed in a heating box at 37°C for
the first 2 h after surgery and thereafter transferred into a heating
box at 351C (overnight). The infarct volume was measured 72 h
after the surgery using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC).
Only those mice in which rCBF below 25% of baseline was
achieved and with a return to > 80% after reperfusion were
included. Infarct volume was calculated as described before
[19,20]. Neurological score was also evaluated 72 h after MCAO
as described previously [21,22]. In a subset of experiments, blood
cell count, BP, pH, and blood oxygen saturation were monitored.
Assessment of Blood–Brain Barrier and Brain
Water Content
Seventy-two hours after MCAO, 2% Evans blue (EB) solution in
0.1 m PBS was slowly injected into the jugular vein (4 mL/kg)
and let circulate for 20–22 h. Trunk blood and brain tissue from
injured and matching contralateral regions were collected and
flash-frozen. EB was extracted by incubating plasma or tissue
samples with 50% TCA solution (1:3), spinning at 10,0009 and
incubating in ethanol (1:3). Fluorescence (620 nm) was measured
using a multiplate reader (Synergy, BioTek) equipped with a K4
Software and calibration curve. The fluorescence intensities were
normalized to wet tissue weight. [23].
Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-
Mediated Biotinylated UTP Nick end Labeling
(TUNEL) Assay
Animals were sacrificed 72 h after the MCAO. Brains were frozen
on dry ice and stored at80°C until 15 lm coronal sections were
cut on a cryostat. Brain sections were mounted on slides and
stored at80°C until they were processed for HE or TUNEL staining.
One slide of sections (a slide adjacent to that taken for H&E
staining, two sections per slide) was taken from within the test
zone of each animal. TUNEL was performed using Apop Tag kit
(Intergen, Purchase, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, the sections were fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Sections underwent two washes in PBS and were
incubated in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and
0.1% sodium citrate) for 30 min at 70°C. Sections were then
washed twice in PBS followed by incubation for 60 min at 37°Cin
“TUNEL reaction mix” from the Apop Tag kit. Sections underwent
two more washes in PBS and were then immersed in Hoechst
33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) solution (1:1000 dilution)
for 10 min. Sections were finally rinsed in distilled water and coverslipped
with antifade mounting medium. A positive control was
performed by incubating slides for 60 min at 37°CinRQ –DNase
solution (2 lL of RQ1 RNase-free DNase; catalog number M6101;
Promega Madison, WI, USA) before incubation in TUNEL reaction
mix. A negative control was performed by incubating sections in
reaction mix that contained only label solution and no TUNEL
enzyme components. All areas of the brain exhibited TUNEL
staining in the positive control slide. No cellular staining was
observed in the negative control slide. TUNEL-positive cells were
counted in 209 microscope fields within frontal cortices (three
fields per section) and parietal cortices (four fields per section)
from a single section for each animal using an object counts array
via BioQuant (Oxford, UK) software. Counts for all seven

microscope fields were summed to yield a single cell count for
each animal [24,25].
Electron Microscopy
Animals were sacrificed 72 h after the MCAO. Mice were perfused
with 2% paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde buffered with
0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Brains were removed and postfixed
with 1% OsO
4
in the same buffer containing 7.5% sucrose
at 4°C for 2 h followed by dehydration with a graded series of ethanol
and embedded in Epon 812. Serial ultrathin sections were
cut with the ultramicrotome and examined with a Hitachi H-7100
(Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope. The mitochondrial
size and shape were quantified using software Image pro plus in a
double-blinded manner.
Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD). Differences
were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed
by Newman–Keuls post hoc testing. A level of P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
Knockdown or Inhibition of Drp1-Attenuated
OGD-Induced Death of SH-SY-5Y Cells
To examine the role of Drp1 in ischemic injury, we generated an
OGD/reoxgeneration model using SH-SY-5Y cells and examined
the effect of either Drp1 knockdown with a specific siRNA or
expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Drp1 (Drp1K38A)
on the survival of SH-SY-5Y cells The RNA interference (RNAi) of
Drp1 significantly reduced Drp1 mRNA and protein levels over
80% in the SH-SY-5Y cells (Figure 1). Drp1 RNAi or overexpression
of Drp1K38A significantly decreased OGD-induced cell death
(Figure 1D and E). To further evaluate the role of Drp1 in ischemic
cell death, a small molecule inhibitor of Drp1, Mitochondrial
Division Inhibitor (Mdivi-1) [26], was used. We observed that
OGD-induced cell death was markedly reversed by this molecule
in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimal concentration at
10 lM(Figure 1F and G).
Knockdown or Inhibition of Drp1-Protected Both
Functional and Structural Integrity of
Mitochondria in Response to OGD
Drp1 can induce excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial
dysfunction even cell death. Inhibition of Drp1
improves mitochondrial morphology and subsequent mitochondrial
functions [27–29]. Using DsRed-Mito to label mitochondria
, we observed that while the normal cells displayed tubular
and long mitochondria (Figure 2A), indicating a balance
between mitochondrial fusion and fission, severe mitochondrial
fragmentation was observed after OGD/reoxgeneration procedure.
Intriguingly, both Drp1 RNAi and Mdivi-1 treatment
(10 lM) dramatically attenuated the mitochondrial fragmentation
(Figure 2A). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that there
was a higher proportion of longer and tubular mitochondria
in the cells treated with either Drp1 siRNA (Figure 2, B–D)

or Mdivi-1(Figure 2E–G) compared with the vehicle-treated
cells.
To examine whether Drp1 inhibition exerts its neuroprotective
effect through modulating the function of mitochondria, HPLC
and TMRM staining were used to measure the ATP levels and
mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) as previously described
[18]. The inhibitor of the electron transport chain complex V oligomycin
was used as positive control. While approximately 36%
reduction in ATP was observed after OGD procedure, this metabolic
deficit was partially abolished by Drp1 RNAi, overexpression
of dominant-negative Drp1 (Drp1-K38A) or Mdivi-1 treatment
(Figure 2H and J). Moreover, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane
potential (Dwm) induced by OGD was also rescued by Drp1
RNAi, overexpression of dominant-negative Drp1(Drp1-K38A) or
mdivi-1 treatment (Figure 2I and K).
Knockdown or Inhibition of Drp1-Blocked OGDInduced
Bax Insertion and Oligomerization and
the Subsequent MOM Permeabilization
Based on the previous findings that Drp1 stimulates tBid-induced
Bax oligomerization through promoting membrane hemifusion
and tethering [14,26,30,31], we attempted to examine whether
Drp1 RNAi or Mdivi-1 affects Bax insertion and oligomerization in
response to OGD. The experiment was performed as described
previously [32,33]. As shown in Figure 3, significant amount of
Bax remained in the mitochondria of the OGD-treated cells, indicating
Bax insertion into mitochondria membrane. Interestingly,
OGD-induced Bax insertion was partially blocked by either Drp1
RNAi or Mdivi-1 treatment.
We further analyzed Bax oligomerization after chemical crosslinking.
As shown in Figure 3G and I, OGD-induced formation of
Bax dimer and trimer in the scramble-siRNA transfected cells. In
contrast, both Drp1 RNAi and Mdivi-1 treatment robustly prevented
OGD-induced Bax dimer and trimer formation (Figure 3H
and J).
To determine whether inhibition of Drp1 suppresses mitochondrial
outer membrane leakage and the subsequent release of apoptogenic
factors, cyto C release in response to OGD was examined.
As shown in Figure 4A and B, knockdown of Drp1 or inhibition of
Drp1 with Mdivi-1 resulted in marked reduction of cyto C in the
cytosol, associated with a marked increase of cyto C in the mitochondrial
fraction in response to OGD. Quantitative results
confirmed that Drp1 RNAi or inhibition with Mdivi-1 significantly
prevented the membrane integration and suppressed the efflux of
cyto C in response to OGD (Figure 4C–F).

Inhibition of Drp1-Attenuated Ischemic Brain
Damage In Vivo
To examine whether the Drp1-specific inhibitor Mdivi-1 protects
neurons in ischemic stroke model, MCAO mice were treated
with different doses of mdivi-1 and brain injury was measured.
Animals treated with vehicle were used as control. Mdivi-1 treatment
remarkably reduced the infarct volume and neurololgical
deficits in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A, B). The BBB
integrity and brain edema extent were also detected as described
previously [23]. We observed that Mdivi-1 treatment dramatically
reduced Evans blue leakage provoked by MCAO
(Figure 5C), suggesting protection of blood–brain barrier integrity
by this compound. Consistently, Mdivi-1 also significantly
decreased the brain edema following the ischemic damage (Figure
5D). As Mdivi-1 was seldomly used at this dose in vivo, a 
subset of mice was injected with Mdivi-1 and physiological state
was measured. The results showed that Mdivi-1 treatment had
no significant influence on blood oxygen saturation, BP, pH, or
blood cell count. (Table 1).
Inhibition of Drp1 Decreased Mitochondrial
Permeability and Apoptosis-Induced by Ischemic
Damage
Based on the neuroprotective effect of the Mdivi-1 in the OGD
model, we attempted to examine whether Drp1-mediated apoptotic
pathways may play a role in ischemic brain damage. We
observed that there were significantly fewer TUNEL-positive
cells in Mdivi-1 treated mice compared with that in the vehicle
group (Figure 6A,B). We also measured Bax expression in the
cytosol and mitochondrial fractions using Western blot analysis.
We observed that there was an obvious accumulation of Bax in
the mitochondrial fraction after ischemic damage in MCA
territory, and Mdivi-1 markedly decreased the expression of
Bax in the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 6C,F,G), suggesting
inhibition of Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria by
Midivi-1. In line with these results, cytosolic cyto C levels
were dramatically suppressed by Mdivi-1 in the MCAO model
(Figure 6C–E).
Midiv-1 Improved Mitochondrial Morphology
and Function After Ischemic Damage
To examine the effect of Mdivi-1 treatment on the mitochondrial
morphology in the MCAO mouse model, electron microscopy
was performed. As shown in Figure 7A, ischemia induced
a dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation in the MCAO model.
Interestingly, the mitochondrial fragmentation was markedly
reduced by the treatment with Mdivi-1. To compare mitochondrial
morphology more objectively, quantitative analysis was
performed. As shown in Figure 7B–D, MCAO induced a dramatic
mitochondrial fragmentation, which was restored by
Mdivi-1 treatment. Compared with the control group, there was
a significant increase in the proportion of elongated mitochondria
in the Mdivi-1-treated group.
We also examined whether Mdivi-1 treatment affect ATP production
in the MCAO model. ATP production in the MCAO territory
was detected by HPLC. As shown in Figure 7E, the metabolic
deficit induced by MCAO was partially abolished by Mdivi-1 treatment
(Figure 7E). These results suggest that the neuroprotective
effects of Mdivi-1 on stroke animal model may be attributable to
its functions of maintaining both structural and functional integrity
of mitochondria.
Discussion
In the present study, we examined the effect of blocking Drp1 on
the overall excessive fission of mitochondria caused by acute
ischemic brain damage both in vivo and in vitro. Blocking Drp1
activity with either pharmacological or genetic approach
significantly prevented cell death and rebuilt the balance of mitochondrial
fission and fusion in MCAO model. Our results are consistent
with the previous findings that blocking mitochondrial
fission or enhancing mitochondrial fusion is protective in animal
models of renal or myocardial ischemia and various neurodegenerative
disorders [29,34,35]. Thus, targeting this pathway
may be a potential therapeutic approach for ischemia injuries
[29,34,36]. Emerging evidences have suggested an important role

of mitochondrial fission in mitochondrial apoptotic pathways
[14,26,28,37]. In the process of apoptosis, proteins confined to the
mitochondrial intermembrane space are released as a result of
increased mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP).
A series of pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, have been
shown to increase MOMP [38,39]. Under normal conditions, Bax
is inactive in cytosol and is soluble or loosely attached to mitochondria.
However, in response to apoptotic stimuli [15], Bax is
translocated and inserted into the outer membrane, undergoes
oligomerization, thereby inducing MOMP. These rearrangements
occur in the outer membrane and require a cooperation among
Bax, BH3-only proteins and the lipid bilayer [40,41].
Several findings suggest that mitochondrial fission proteins
including Drp1 [42] may play a role in increasing MOMP and
the subsequent cyto c release [15] under ischemic conditions.
A recent study demonstrated that tBid could induce mitochondrial
fragmentation and MOMP in a Drp1-dependent manner
in a glutamate-induced oxidative stress model [10]. However,
it is unknown whether tBid directly interacts with Drp1. It has
been proposed that the interplay between Bid and Drp1 may
involve other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax. In line with this
notion, our data demonstrate that inhibition of Drp1 with
either Mdivi-1 or Drp1 RNAi dramatically blocked Bax
insertion, oligomerization and subsequent cyto c release both
in vitro and in vivo.
The effects of manipulating mitochondrial dynamics on the
mitochondrial function have not been fully illustrated in stroke
animal models. Though a recent study showed that Mdivi-1 prevented
glutamate excitotoxicity in primary cultured neurons and
reduced the infarct size in a cerebral ischemia model [10], mitochondrial
morphology and functions were not evaluated in this
study. In our previous study, we had reported the beneficial effect
of inhibition of Drp1 in the protection against OGD neurons [43].
However, we did not describe the underlying mechanism of this
function, and the protective effect on ischemic animal models was
not included in that study.
Using electronic microscopy, we observed that compared with
the large proportion of smaller mitochondria in the MCAO mice
treated with vehicle, there was a significant increased in the fraction
of elongated mitochondria in the Mdivi-1 treated group.
Moreover, we observed that inhibition of Drp1 prevented ischemia-induced
collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential
(Dwm) and bioenergetic defects, suggested that inhibition of Drp1
protects against ischemic damage by maintaining mitochondrial
integrity and attenuating the functional deficits of mitochondria,
including ATP release andDwmreduction.
Taken together, we report that blocking the function of the
mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 protected neurons against
ischemic injury both in vitro and in vivo. Several possible mechanisms
were proposed based on our observations. First, inhibition
of Drp1 restores the balance between fission and fusion, thereby
maintained mitochondrial structural integrity. Second, Drp1 inhibition
prevents bioenergetic deficits induced by ischemic damage.
Third, blocking the function of Drp1 decreases Bax oligomerization
and the release of proapoptotic factors during ischemic
damage.

Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that Drp1 inhibition not only
attenuated OGD-induced cell death, but also significantly reduced
infarct volume and neuronal death in the MCAO mouse model.
These effects were associated with a reversal of the morphological
change of mitochondria and restoration of proper mitochondrial
functions after ischemic injury. These effects may be attributable
to its inhibition of Bax insertion to the mitochondrial outer
membrane and oligomerization, and the subsequent release of
cytochrome C.
