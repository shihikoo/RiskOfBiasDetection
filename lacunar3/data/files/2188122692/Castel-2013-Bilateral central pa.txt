Bilateral central pain sensitization in rats following
a unilateral thalamic lesion may be treated with
high doses of ketamine
Aude Castel1, Pierre Hélie2, Francis Beaudry1 and Pascal Vachon1*
Abstract
Background: Central post-stroke pain is a neuropathic pain condition caused by a vascular lesion, of either
ischemic or hemorrhagic origin, in the central nervous system and more precisely involving the
spinothalamocortical pathway responsible for the transmission of painful sensations. Few animal models have been
developed to study this problem. The objectives of this study were to evaluate different modalities of pain in a
central neuropathic pain rat model and to assess the effects of ketamine administered at different doses. Animals
were evaluated on the rotarod, Hargreaves, Von Frey and acetone tests. A very small hemorrhage was created by
injecting a collagenase solution in the right ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus. Following the establishment of
the neuropathy, ketamine was evaluated as a therapeutic drug for this condition.
Results: Histopathological observations showed a well localized lesion with neuronal necrosis and astrocytosis
following the collagenase injection that was localized within the VPL. No significant change in motor coordination
was observed following surgery in either the saline or collagensae groups. In the collagenase group, a significant
decrease in mechanical allodynia threshold was observed. A sporadic and transient cold allodynia was also noted.
No thermal hyperalgesia was seen following the collagenase injection. Ketamine was then tested as a potential
therapeutic drug. A significant decrease in motor coordination was seen only following the administration of
25 mg/kg of ketamine in both groups. An alleviation of mechanical allodynia was achieved only with the high
ketamine dose. The minimal effective ketamine serum concentration (150 ng/mL) was only achieved in animals that
received 25 mg/kg.
Conclusions: An intrathalamic hemorrhage induced a bilateral mechanical allodynia in rats. Cold hyperalgesia was
observed in 60% of these animals. Mechanical allodynia was alleviated with high doses of ketamine which
corresponded with therapeutic plasmatic concentrations.

Background
Central post stroke pain (CPSP) can develop following a
vascular lesion of cortical and subcortical structures [1].
CPSP was first associated with thalamic infarcts by two
French neurologists [2] and they termed this condition
« thalamic syndrome ». However, further investigations
suggested that central pain could be induced by stroke
in other structures all along the spinothalamic pathway
[3]. Development of pain in stroke patients is of great
concern since it deteriorates their quality of life making
daily activities difficult, compromising rehabilitation
efforts, altering mobility, concentration, mood [4,5] and
eventually leading to depression [4,6]. Little is known
about the treatment of this condition and therefore
CPSP management represents a real medical challenge
and requires further understanding of its mechanisms.
CPSP is characterized by spontaneous and evoked pain
[7,8]. Allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, can be typical
clinical signs recognized in patients and they are induced
by thermal (especially cold) and mechanical stimuli [7,9].
In recent population-based studies, CPSP incidence
between 7.3% and 10.5% is reported amongst stroke

patients [10,11]. Some studies suggest that the prevalence
of CPSP depends on the location of the lesion and
it appears to develop more commonly after medullar
infarctions or thalamic lesions [12-14]. A higher incidence
occurs following a hemorrhage in the posterolateral
and dorsal thalamic nuclei (32% and 25%
respectively) [12]. Additionally, it seems that right sided
lesions predominate in CPSP patients at both cortical
and thalamic levels [15]. Functional imaging studies
have helped us to identify structures involved in CPSP
[16-18] and ventroposterior (VP) thalamic nuclei play a
key role in this condition [19,20].
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain central
neuropathic pain [21-23]. In central pain, nociceptive neuronal
hyperactivity suggests a central sensitization mechanism
possibly involving N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors [24,25]. Ketamine, a well-know NMDA receptor
antagonist, has been used to treat various neuropathic pain
disorders [26-29]. Furthermore,theuseofketaminetotreat
CPSP has been shown efficacious in CPSP patients [30,31].
Therefore NMDA receptors could play an important role
in CPSP.
The use of animal models can help us understand the
mechanisms involved in CPSP and allow testing of new
therapeutic approaches for this condition. Wasserman
and Koeberle [32] were able to recreate central pain by
injecting collagenase within the ventroposterolateral
thalamus nucleus of rats creating an intracerebral
hemorrhage. The objectives of the present study were to
evaluate if central pain persists over a longer period of
time, using Wasserman and Koeberle’s model, and to
evaluate in a preliminary study if ketamine could be
used for the alleviation of pain in this model.
Results
Following surgery, some rats (40-50%) in the collagenase
group were reluctant to be manually held and vocalized
during manipulations. These occurrences were never observed
prior to the surgery, neither were they observed in
our previous experiments using a peripheral neuropathy
rat model.
Evaluation of the central pain model
Motor coordination evaluated with the rotarod test
No significant difference between sham and collagenase
groups was observed on the rotarod test (F
1,13

Results are shown in Figure 1.
Heat hyperalgesia evaluated with Hargreave’s test
At baseline and during the first part of the experimentation

= 0.23, ns).
Results are shown in Figure 2.
Mechanical allodynia evaluated with Von Frey filaments
Results are presented in Figure 3. Prior to surgery, there
was no difference in mechanical sensitivity for both hind
paws when comparing sham and collagenase groups. Following
surgery, significant differences in mechanical
thresholds occurred in the right (F

(n = 8) or a collagenase solution (n = 7) in the ventroposterolateral
nucleus of the thalamus. No significant difference was seen between
sham and collagenase groups at baseline and at different post
surgical time points up to 22 days (F

= 0.18, ns). Only the IP
administration of 25 mg/kg of ketamine caused a significant
impairment (p < 0.05) in motor coordination seen in both groups.

collagenase group. In the sham group, no difference was
seen between baseline values and post-surgical results.
Evaluation of cold allodynia with the acetone test
Animals in the sham group never had reactions to acetone
that were different from baseline. These animals
either didn't move or lifted their paw rapidly only once
at the acetone application. Conversely, an increase in the
number and duration of movements in the collagenase
group with acetone (graded 2) was seen with peak
reaching up to 57% of rats on days 8 and 18 postsurgery.
Some of these animals would have marked reactions
with either duration being around 10s, or number
of movements being as high as 10 (Figure 4). Right and
left hind limbs were affected in these animals. However,
these results failed to show any statistical significance
when compared to the sham group. The percentage of
animal in the collagenase group that reacted to acetone
slowly decreased and the reactions were comparable to
baseline by the end of the study.
Evaluation of ketamine
Rats from the sham and the collagenase groups received
a single IP injection of ketamine (100 mg/mL) of 1, 10
and 25 mg/kg on respectively days 28, 30 and 32 postsurgery.
Behavioral tests started 30 min after the injection
of the ketamine solution and the experimenter was
blinded to the treatment drug and concentrations.
Injections of ketamine at 1 and 10 mg/kg did not affect
the rotarod performance however with 25 mg/kg of
ketamine, it was significantly impaired for animals in
the sham (p < 0.03) and collagenase (p < 0.05) groups
(Figure 1). The thermal sensitivity did not differ between
sham and collagenase groups following the administration
of ketamine at 1, 10 and 25 mg/kg (Figure 2). Values were
comparable to baseline suggesting that even the high dose
of ketamine did not affect reflex activity. Ketamine had an
alleviating effect on mechanical allodynia (Figure 3). With
1 and 10 mg/kg, there was no effect on mechanical
sensitivity in either hind paw however with 25 mg/kg of
ketamine mechanical allodynia was reduced in the
contralateral (p < 0.0001) and ipsilateral (p < 0.01) hind
paws.
Plasmatic ketamine concentrations
At the end of the study (day 35), 6 rats (3/dose) from
the sham group were used to evaluate the plasmatic
concentration of ketamine following an IP administration
of 10 or 25 mg/kg. Following 10 mg/kg ketamine
IP, mean plasmatic concentrations at 30 min, 1 and 2 h
post administration were respectively 78 ± 23, 48 ± 14
and 22 ± 8 ng/mL. Following 25 mg/kg ketamine IP
mean plasmatic concentrations at 30 min, 1 and 2 h
post administration were respectively 142 ± 47, 96 ± 75
and 59 ± 25 ng/mL. Maximal concentrations following
25 mg/kg seen at 30 min and 1 h post-ketamine administration
range from 181 to 204 ng/mL.
Histopathological evaluation
Microscopic evaluation of brain slices from the sham
group showed no necrotic neuron and no astrocytosis in
the VPL nucleus. In the collagenase group, small well

baseline values between both saline and collagenase groups. As
early as the second post-surgical day, a significant decrease in the
mechanical threshold in both hind limbs was noted for the
collagenase group when compared to sham animals in the right
(F

= 130.4, p < 0.0001) and left (F

paws. Only the 25 mg/kg of ketamine dose reduced mechanical
allodynia in the contralateral (p < 0.0001) and ipsilateral (p < 0.01)
hind paws.

circumscribed lesions were observed in the lateral
thalamic nuclei (including the VPL) (Figure 5). On H&E
sections, neuronal, and in some cases neuropil degeneration
was observed and a large number of small nuclei
was present in the lesioned areas, most probably reactive
astrocytes. A marked decrease in the number of normal
neurons is appreciated with the cresyl violet stain
(Figure 6). Reactive astrocytes (filamentous structures) are
clearly seen with GFAP immunochemistry at the site of
the lesion (Figure 7). With GFAP immunohistochemistry,
some mineralization (dark blue granular clumps) was
observed in the vicinity of the lesion. The contralateral
side of the corresponding thalamic lesioned area was
uneventful.
Discussion
In this study, we used a model of central pain in rats
induced by an intrathalamic hemorrhage in the
ventroposterolateral nucleus [32] to evaluate the development
and maintenance of neuropathic pain and assess
ketamine as a potential therapeutic drug. We observed a
significant mechanical allodynia up to 30 days after the intracerebral
lesion, and a transient cold allodynia in up to
60% of these animals. No heat hyperalgesia occurred in
the lesioned animals. These results reflect clinical signs
such as mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia seen
in human with post-stroke pain [7,9]. We also found
that only the highest dose of ketamine administered
(25 mg/kg IP) was able to alleviate the mechanical
allodynia. However since animal were also affected on
the rotarod, a decrease of motor control could be a
confounding variable.
Mechanical and cold allodynia, have been described in
patients with thalamic stroke [1,8,9,11,33]. In one particular
study among CPSP patients, allodynia was relatively common
with a higher incidence in patients with thalamic
lesions [1]. Tactile hypoesthesia may also occur in the absence
of tactile allodynia whereas normal tactile detection
threshold can be associated with the presence of tactile
allodynia [33]. In our experiment, a decrease in the mechanical
allodynia threshold in both hind paws appeared
following surgery and persisted over time. These results
are concordant with those of Wasserman and Koeberle
[32] who observed mechanical allodynia for 7 days following
the collagenase injections. Mechanical allodynia has
also been reported following kainate lesions in the VPL,
however, animals were not tested beyond 48 h [34].

Wasserman and Koeberle [32] reported that mechanical
allodynia was unilateral and contralateral to the side of the
lesion which could be associated with some methodological
differences as baseline evaluations were not
performed and the mechanical sensitivity was evaluated
for a short period.
Change in thermal sensitivity, either to cold and less
often to hot temperatures, is commonly found in CPSP
patients [8,33]. In our study we didn’t observe a decrease
in heat threshold following the intracerebral hemorrhage.
La Buda et al. [34] and Wasserman and Koeberle [32]
noted a heat sensitization for 2 and up to 21 days, respectively.
Wasserman and Koeberle [32] used the hot plate
test which could give different results from our findings
with Hargreave’s test. We have no clear explanation for
these difference results at the present time.
Abnormal sensitivity to cold has been described in
CPSP patients [8,9,11,33]. The prevalence of cold
allodynia varies between 18 and 66% in CPSP patients
with thalamic lesions [1,11,33]. Conversely, one study
reports that CPSP patient suffered mainly from cold
hypoesthesia [33]. Our results reflect findings in human
patients as cold allodynia appeared as a sporadic sensory
abnormality [1,11].
Bilateral sensitization to thermal and mechanical stimuli
has been reported in rodent following unilateral electrolytic
or demyelinating lesions in the spinothalamic tract
and following a hematoma targeted at the basal ganglia,
extending into thalamic nuclei [23,35]. In a mouse
model of left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke,
hyperesthesia developed in both hind paws and mechanical
allodynia was present only in the ipsilateral side
of the lesion [36]. Lesion of lateral thalamic neurons or
projection fibers to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei
could explain our findings since disinhibition in these
nuclei may occur with VPL lesions [37]. Nociceptive
intralaminar thalamic neurons have very large often
bilateral receptive fields and if sensitized could account
for the bilateral signs observed in our study [38]. In rats,
there are also bilateral projections to the thalamus from
spinothalamic neurons which may explain bilateral signs
[39,40]. In human, bilateral sensory abnormalities have
been described in a few cases [41]. Bilateral hypoesthesia
to cold and warm has been reported in CPSP patients
[33]. Bilateral processing of pain hypersensitivity has been
shown to occur in human and can be explained by
changes involving the putamen, thalamus, insula, anterior
cingulate cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex,
which may all participate in the bilateral spread of pathological
pain resulting from unilateral injury [42-44]. All
these proposals may explain bilateral pain following a
unilateral lesion of spinothalamic structures however they
are speculative and need to be addressed in future
experiments.
The neuropathy onset following collagenase injection
was rapid in our animal model. In humans, few patients
develop central pain immediately after the stroke and it
occurs in the majority of patients within 1 to 3 month
of the stroke [8,9]. In only one retrospective analysis of
175 patients with thalamic hemorrhage, the delay to
develop thalamic syndrome was between 3 and 15 days
after the lesion [12]. We have no clear explanation for
the difference between findings in the animals and
clinical findings in human. One hypothesis would be
that plasticity and neuronal reorganization are faster in
rodent’s nervous system than in humans. Although, we
have not performed chronic evaluations (at least
3 months), persistence of mechanical allodynia was well
established in our study which leads us to suspect that
this model is suitable to study chronic central pain
syndrome mechanisms.
In humans, ketamine can alleviate allodynia and
hyperalgesia associated with chronic neuropathic pain
state of either peripheral or central origins [26,30,31]. In
a randomized, double blind crossover study with ketamine
, continuous and evoked pain (notably mechanical
allodynia) in patients suffering central dysesthesia following
spinal cord injury, was markedly reduced [28].
Our study shows that relatively high doses of ketamine
could reduce mechanical allodynia induced by an
intrathalamic hematoma in the thalamus. There were
no effects of ketamine for both the saline and collagenase
groups on the Hargreave’s test, which suggest that
the high dose did not affect reflex activity. With von
Frey filaments, it is the sensitivity to the mechanical
touch stimulus that is evaluated, the reaction time component
of this task is not measured, and we would
therefore suggest that ketamine does have an effect of
mechanical allodynia.
Evaluation of plasmatic concentration following injection
of the different doses in rats revealed that the
minimal effective plasma concentration of ketamine
(approx. 200 ng/mL) was achieved only in a few animals
at 25 mg/kg IP, which is the same plasmatic therapeutic
concentration needed for treatment of neuropathic pain
in humans [45]. Eide et al. [28] have shown that there
was a highly significant correlation between the serum
concentration of ketamine and the reduction of
continuous pain following a single bolus administration
of the drug. However, unique administration could be of
short duration if a targeted plasmatic concentration is
necessary to treat central pain. Other beneficial effects
with chronic administrations could be associated with
the modulation of synaptic plasticity over time. Unfortunately
, high dose of ketamine impaired motor coordination
which would be detrimental in CPSP patients.
Reported side effects in human include among others
dysphoria, sedation, light-headedness [26,30,33] as well

as motor impairment, delirium, amnesia, anxiety, and
panic attacks [27]. Long-term use of ketamine for the
management of CPSP should be recommended only
after weighing the pros and cons with the patients as
well as considering first other therapeutic strategies.
Allodynia and hyperalgesia in CPSP patients may
result from neuronal hyperexcitability which may be
related to central sensitization [25,46]. Since ketamine
appears to reduce mechanical allodynia following
intrathalamic hemorrhage, NMDA receptors activation
may be one of the mechanisms generating CPSP. Blockade
of NMDA receptors reduces central pain by decreasing
neuronal hyperexcitability [47] and therefore this drug is
justified for the treatment of central neuropathic pain. In
central pain, damage to neurons from excitatory amino
acids (ex. glutamate) related to NMDA receptors overactivation
could be a contributing factor to the pathology
[46]. The evaluation of ketamine in this model was done
at the end of our study and it was only performed as a
preliminary study for future investigations.
Conclusions
A unilateral intracerebral thalamic hemorrhage in rats
following injection of a collagenase solution within the
right VPL caused bilateral allodynia. A long lasting
mechanical allodynia developed soon after the surgery.
Some animals also developed a transient cold allodynia.
Administration of ketamine, a NMDA receptor antagonist
, decreased ipsilateral mechanical allodynia. These
results suggest that NMDA receptors may be involved
in the sensitization mechanism of central post-stroke
pain.
Methods
Animals
Sixteen Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River, St-Constant,
QC, Canada) between 7 and 8 weeks of age (BW: 300–
350 g) were purchased for this study. They were housed in
a standard environment (fresh filtered air: 15 changes/h,
temperature: 21 ± 3°C, humidity: 40-60% and light–dark
cycle: 12 h:12 h). Prior to the surgery, rats were pairhoused
in polycarbonate cages (Ancare, Bellmore, NY,
USA) on hardwood bedding (Beta chip, North-Eastern
Products Co., Warrenburg, NY, USA) and acclimated to
their environment for 7 days prior to the initiation of the
study. Following surgery, the animals were housed
individually to avoid suture chewing. The animals were
fed a rodent chow (Charles River Rodent Chow 5075,
St-Constant, Qc) and received tap water, both ad libitum.
The University of Montreal ’s Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
approved the experimental protocol prior to animal use
in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.
Surgical techniques
The surgery was performed according to the model previously
described by Rosenberg et al. [48]. Rats were divided
in two equal sized groups (sham and collagenase). Under
general anesthesia, one group received the collagenase
solution (collagenase group) and the other sterile saline
(sham group) using a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Animals were anesthetized
using vaporized isoflurane (5% induction, 3% maintenance
) (Aerrane, Baxter, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in
oxygen. Animals were placed on a regulated heating blanket
and body temperature was monitored using a rectal
probe (Thermalert TH-8, Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA) to
keep temperature within normal limits (36-37°C). Pulse
oximetry (CANL-425 V, Med Associates, St-Alban, VT,
USA) was monitored using a probe taped on the hind limb
to assure proper blood oxygenation (95–99%). The skin
hair was clipped and cleaned with an iodine solution. A
sagittal skin incision from behind both eyes to the occipital
bone was made and the periosteum was gently detached
from the underlying bone to allow visualization of
bregma. Using stereotaxic coordinates (anterior posterior
3.5 mm, and lateral to 3.5 mm, in reference to bregma on
the right side only) [49], a burr hole (diameter 1.5 mm) in
the bone was perform using a stereotaxic drill, then a 5μL
Hamilton syringe containing 0.25 μL of a solution of 0.025
UI of collagenase (Type IV) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON,
Canada) prepared in sterile saline was lowered 6 mm
ventral to the dura matter. One animal died during surgery
leaving 7 animals in the collagenase group. Control
animals received an equal volume of sterile saline (0.9%
NaCl) using the same methods. Injections were performed
over 2 min then the needle was kept in place for an extra
5 min to allow good diffusion of the solution and prevent
reflux along the needle track. The needle was then
slowly withdrawn and the skin was closed using simple
discontinuous Monocryl 4.0 sutures (Ethicon, Johnson
& Johnson). The animals were singly caged to allow for
a smooth recovery.
Behavioral study
All animals were trained daily on all behavioral tests 
(rotarod, Hargreave, von Frey and acetone tests) for one
week prior to the beginning of the study. Finally, mechanical
allodynia was evaluated using Von Frey filaments.
Baseline values were obtained 3 days prior to surgery.
After surgery, animals were given one day to recover
then were tested on days 2, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 postsurgery
to evaluate if neuropathic pain was present and
persisted over time. Tests were always performed in the
morning to avoid circadian variations. Rats were acclimated
for 15 min in the room prior to the beginning of
testing.

Rotarod test
To evaluate if the surgery and the treatment had any effect
on motor coordination, animals were evaluated on the
rotarod treadmill (Rotarod ENV-576, Med Associates Inc.,
St-Albans, VT, USA). The rotarod was set to the acceleration
mode of 5 to 35 revolutions per min over 5 min. The
maximum time the animal stayed on the rotarod (up to a
maximum of 5 min), was recorded for each performance.
Von Frey mechanical sensitivity test
All animals were evaluated with von Frey filaments
(Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) as described by
Chaplan et al. [50] to establish mechanical sensitivity.
Rats were placed on a customized platform with mesh
floor in Plexiglas chambers. Testing sessions began after
15 min habituation to the experimental setup. Testing
was done by applying Von Frey filaments through the
grid floor on the central region of the plantar surface of
the rat’s hind paws, avoiding the foot pads. The filaments
were applied only when the rats were stationary on 4
paws. A trial consisted of applications of the different filaments
ranging from 4 to 22 g, starting with the smallest
filament. Pressure was applied until buckling occurred
for approximately 3 seconds. Rats were tested in groups
of 4 animals and to avoid the effect of anticipation, a
first paw was tested in all animals and then the opposite
paw in the same fashion. The test began with either the
right or the left hind paw alternatively. When no reaction
was seen for a given filament, the next filament with
higher rigidity was applied. If for a given filament, the
animal withdrew its hind paw, the filament of lower rigidity
was applied to evaluate the absence of withdrawal
and then with the greater diameter filament to confirm
the threshold. The force corresponding to the smallest
filament causing a withdrawal reaction was recorded.
The force corresponding to each filament was measured
with the use of a weighing scale, at the beginning and at
the end of the study to confirm force consistency.
Hargreave thermal sensitivity test
Thermal sensitivity was evaluated using a Hargreaves
apparatus (IITC Life Science, CA, USA) as previously described
[51]. Each animal was placed in a Plexiglas chamber
with the ground floor made of heated glass (27-31°C).
Animals were allowed to acclimate to the experimental set
up for 15 min prior to testing. Then radiant heat generated
by a high intensity light bulb (40 W) was directed to
the plantar surface of the hind paw. The lamp generated
noxious heat stimulus. The time the animal took to lift its
paw from the floor was recorded and noted as the thermal
threshold. Rats were tested in groups of 4 animals and to
avoid the effect of anticipation, a first paw was tested in all
animals and then the opposite paw in the same fashion.
The test began with either the right or the left hind paw
alternatively to prevent any anticipatory behavior. A cut
off time of the radiant stimulation was set at 20 sec to
minimize tissue injury.
Acetone test
This test was performed according to the method previously
described by Choi et al. [52] With the animals
standing on a mesh floor, acetone (25 μL) was applied to
the plantar surface of the hind paw with a syringe without
touching the paw. The number of movement of the
paw and duration of the behavior were recorded for 30 s
following the acetone application. Both hind paws were
tested alternatively. . Responses to acetone were graded
on the following scale: 0 = no reaction, 1 = mild reaction
characterized by quick withdrawal (less than 3 movements)
or short duration of lifting paw (less than 3 seconds), 2 =
longer withdrawal or repeated movements (≥3movements
or ≥3 seconds). Animals considered truly reactive to
acetone to determine the percentages of reactive
animals are the ones graded 2. Data are presented in
Figure 4 as the percentage of animal in each group that
reacted to acetone.
Treatment with ketamine
At the end of the behavioral study, animals were tested
following the administration of ketamine. This short term
evaluation was performed as a preliminary study, planned
uniquely to be indicative of the potential therapeutic value
of ketamine. Importantly, the operator was blinded to the
treatments (type of drug and dose given) administered to
the animals. The rats from the sham and the collagenase
groups received IP injection of ketamine (100 mg/mL;
Vetalar Bioniche Animal Health, Belleville, ON) at 1, 10
and 25 mg/kg on days 28, 30 and 32 post-surgery respectively.
Behavioral tests started 30 min after the injection of
the ketamine solution.
Histological methods
Under deep isoflurane anesthesia, the abdominal cavity
was opened and the abdominal aorta was clamped. Rats
were perfused with an intracardiac infusion of first a
physiological dextrose-sucrose solution (100 mL/rat;
solutioncomposition(1L):8gNaCl,4gdextrose,8g
sucrose, 0,23 g calcium chloride), followed by a 10%
buffered formalin solution (100 mL/rat). The brains
were removed and fixed in formalin for a minimum of
48 h prior to being embedded in paraffin. Transverse
sections (4 μm thick) from the thalamus were made
using a microtome. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and cresyl violet using standard
methods. Immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) was performed prior to microscopic
evaluation. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained
from BioGenex Laboratories (San Ramon, CA). The

immunoglobulin fraction was composed of rabbit antisera
diluted in PBS (pH 7.6) in 1% bovine serum albumin.
Antibodies were stained with a commercially available
immunoperoxidase procedure (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In addition, positive and
negative controls for all brain slices were provided for
proper identification of reactive astrocytes. Sections were
reviewed by a board certified pathologist (Dr Pierre Hélie
DVM, DACVP, Department of Veterinary Pathology,
University of Montreal).
Bioanalytical methods
At the end of the study (day 35), 6 rats (3/dose) were used
to measure plasmatic concentrations of ketamine following
an IP administration of 10 or 25 mg/kg. Under
isoflurane anesthesia for a short period of time (less than
2 min), jugular blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected in
sodium heparin tubes at 30 min, 1 and 2 h post injection.
Blood samples were maintained on ice and centrifuged
(3200 g for 10 min) within 30 min of collection. They were
then stored at −80°C pending analysis by tandem liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
The analysis of ketamine was performed using a high
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer
(HPLC-MS/MS). Briefly, the HPLC system
consisted of a Perkin Elmer Series 200 (Boston, MA,
USA) and a SCIEX API 2000 QTRAP hybrid MS system
(AB Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada). Data acquisition and
analysis were performed using analyst 1.5 (Concord,
ON, Canada) and PRISM version 5.0 d) GraphPad software
(La Jolla, CA, USA). Calibration curves were
calculated from the equation y = ax + b, as determined
by weighted (1/×) linear regression of the calibration
line constructed from the peak-area ratios of the drug
and the internal standard. Ketamine was extracted from
rat plasma using a protein precipitation method. Fifty
μL of each sample was mixed with 250 μL of internal 
standard solution (100 ng/mL of dextromethorphan in
50:50 acetone : methanol) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
Samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min and
200 μL of the supernatant was transferred into a 400 μL
injection vial. The chromatographic separation was
performed using an isocratic mobile phase with a
Thermo Hypersil Phenyl 100 × 2 mm (5 μm) column.
The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, methanol
and 0.5% formic acid in water at a ratio of 60:20:20,
respectively. The flow rate was fixed at 0.3 mL/min.
Two μL of the extracted sample was injected and the
total run time was set to 3 min. The mass spectrometer
was interfaced with the HPLC system using a pneumatic
assisted electrospray ion source. The Nitrogen gas 1 was
set to 25 PSI, the Nitrogen gas 2 was set to 40 PSI and
the electrospray electrode was set to 4000 V. The
declustering (DP) potential was set to 15 V and the
collision energy (CE) was set to 30 V. The selected reaction
monitoring (SRM) transitions were set to m/z
238→163 and 272→215 for ketamine and dextromethorphan
(internal standard) respectively. The dwell
time was set to 150 msec and the pause time at 5 msec.
For the bioanalytical method performance, a linear regression
(weighted 1/concentration) was judged to produce
the best fit for the concentration-detector relationship.
The analytical ranges used were from 10 to 2 500 ng/mL.
Observed coefficients of determination (R2)were≥0.9913.
The precision obtained ranged from 10.1% - 13.8% for and
the accuracy observed was 97.0% - 104.3%. The limit of
quantification was set at 10 ng/mL, according to the
bioanalytical validation guideline published by the FDA,
acceptable precision and accuracy results were achieved.
Statistical analyses
The statistical analyses of behavioral data were conducted
using a 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures and post
hoc Tuckey tests performed with SAS (version 9.2, SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For evaluation of cold allodynia,
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for ordinal data was used.
For the ketamine behavioral results t-test were used to
compare shams to controls. Results are presented as
means and standard errors of the mean. Analyses revealing
p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
