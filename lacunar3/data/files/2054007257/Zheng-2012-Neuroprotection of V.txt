Cerebral palsy (CP) is a very common neural system development disorder that can cause physical
disability in human. Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected neural stem cells (NSCs) in newborn rats with cerebral palsy (CP). Seven-day-old
Sprague-Dawleyratswererandomlydividedintofourgroups:shamoperation(controlgroup),PBStransplantation (PBS group), VEGF+NSCs transplantation (transgene NSCs group) and NSCs transplantation
groups (NSCs group). PBS, Transgene NSCs and NSCs groups respectively received stereotactic injections
of PBS, lentiviral vector (pGC-FU-VEGF) infected NSCs or a NSCs suspension in the left sensory-motor
cortex 3 days after CP model was established. The NSCs activity, their impacts on neural cell growth
and apoptosis, brain development and animal behaviors were examined on the animals up to age 35-
days. As expected, unilateral carotid artery occlusion plus hypoxia (cerebral palsy model) resulted in
severe neural developmental disorders, including slowed growth, increased in cortical neuron apoptosis,
decreased cerebral cortex micro-vessel density and retarded behavior developments. Transplantation of
NSCs not only resulted in increases in VEGF protein expression in rat brains, but also largely prevented
the behavioral defects and brain tissue pathology that resulted from cerebral palsy procedure, with animals received VEGF transfected NSCs always being marginally better than these received un-transfected
cells. In conclusion, NSCs transplantation can partially prevent/slow down the brain damages that are
associated with CP in the newborn rats, suggesting a new possible strategy for CP treatment.

1. Introduction
Cerebral palsy (CP) is considered as the most common motor
dysfunctional disease in children. Based on statistics from the
World Health Organization, CP incidence occurs in 3.3% of live
births and is evident in premature children as well as in children with very low birth weights. The majority of CP children
exhibit mental retardation, epilepsy, abnormal behavior, perception disorders, language dysfunction and other abnormalities,
which seriously impacts health and development [1]. Current CP
treatmentislimitedatsymptomaticandsupportive,andthereisno
direct method to prevent brain damage or promote neural regeneration. Therefore, CP has been an important issue for the healthy
development of children.

The functional repair of injured neurons and reconstitution of
neuronal structures is a very attractive and active direction in
neuroscience research field [2]. Recently, NSCs isolated from the
embryos of rats and humans have shown self-renewal, high proliferative rates and multipotency. In addition, NSCs can be used to
generate new nerve cells [3]. However, there are few and scattered
NSCs in the brain, and NSCs possess a limited capacity to self-repair
in situ after developing brain cells are damaged [4,5]. NSCs can differentiateintospecificneurons,butthecapacityforsecretingnerve
growth factors is insufficient, which may limit their potential for
neural repair. Because of the proliferation and differentiation characteristics
, NSCs in neural transplantation can be used as “seed”
cells for both cell replacement therapy and as a vector cell for gene
therapy [6,7].
Among the growth factors that may play a role in neural
cell growth, VEGF demonstrates its important roles for its angiogenic
, neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Angiogenesis
is closely associated with neural regeneration [8,9], which may
provide a microenvironment for the NSCs derived regeneration
to take place [10]. The important roles played by VEGF in brain
function recovery is evidenced by our recently study indicated that
increasing VEGF expression in brain can significantly improve the

in neonatal rats [11]. In another study [12], we have found that
NSCs transplantation by itself significantly improved the nerve
function of neonatal rats following brain injury. Moreover, combination of VEGF expression with NSCs transplantation also has
been tried and an even better result was got. For example, Zhu
et al. [13] performed VEGF-transfected NSCs transplantation for
the treatment of transient cerebral ischemia in adults, and found
that VEGF-transfected NSCs migrated and expressed gene products in the host brain tissue, as well as exhibited a neuroprotective
effectonlocalbloodvesselsandnervestructures.Tofurtherexplore
the potential of NSCs transplantation as well as VEGF expression
on the prevention of brain injures, we constructed a recombinant
lentiviral vector pGC-FU-VEGF that carries VEGF165 for infection

experimental results show that, NSCs as well as VEGF-transfected

2. Materials and methods
2.1. NSCs isolation and culture
Using a previously described method [14], Sprague Dawley rats pregnant for
14–16 days were anesthetized by 3% chloral hydrate via intraperitoneal injection.
Embryos were then removed under sterile conditions and trypsinized into a single cell suspension. After digestion was terminated, samples were filtered and
centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and specimens were incubated with
NSCsconditionedmedium(DMEM/F12)containingbFGF(20g/mL,ChangshaLixin
Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China), EGF (20g/mL, PeproTech), B27 (20L/mL, Beijing
Dingguo Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China) and insulin (100ng/mL). NSCs were harvested on day 14 after primary culture and confirmed by their expression of NSCs
marker protein nestin, through immunofluorescence method.
2.2. Construction of the recombinant lentiviral vector pGC-FU-VEGF
Primers were designed using the human VEGF165 gene sequence (AF486837)
from GenBank. A VEGF165 gene fragment was PCR amplified and cloned into the
lentiviral vector (pGC-FU) producing a recombinant lentivirus (pGC-FU-VEGF) carrying VEGF165 with green fluorescence protein as a marker. NSCs were transfected
with pGC-FU-VEGF and green fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence
microscope. RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that VEGF165 was correctly cloned
into the lentiviral vector.
2.3. pGC-FU-VEGF transfection of NSCs
Using a previously described method [15], passage 4 NSCs were resuspened
after centrifugation, then transfected with pGC-FU-VEGF (MOI=50). After 8h transfection
, the culture medium was discarded and replaced with NSCs culture medium
for an additional 48h. G418 (400mg/L) was added to the NSCs culture medium
for selection of positive clones, which were formed 2 weeks later. Positive clones
were continuously cultured in 400mg/L G418 for an additional 2 weeks. Green fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan), and
the transfection efficiency was detected by flow cytometry (FACSAria, BD Company,
USA).
2.4. Animal grouping
Animal experimentation was approved by the Department of Animals, Central
South University Xiangya School of Medicine, China. Healthy 7-day-old Sprague
Dawley rats without selection of gender were randomly divided into four groups
with 20 animals in each: sham operation for CP model (control group), PBS transplantation (PBS group), VEGF+NSC transplantation (transgene NSCs group) and
NSCs transplantation groups (NSCs group). Sham-operated rats only underwent left
common carotid artery isolation without ligation or hypoxia. NSCs transplantations
were performed 3 days after the CP model was establishment.
2.5. CP model establishment
CP models were established using unilateral carotid artery occlusion [16]. The
ratswereplacedinasupinepositionafteretherinhalationanesthesia,thenamedian
neck incision was performed followed by ligation of the left common carotid artery
andthensuturingoftheskinincision.Ratswerereturnedtocagesfor2h,thenplaced
at 37 ◦C in a 1L plexiglass hypoxic chamber (closed arch-crown and square bottom,
two holes at 1cm×1cm on both sides, connected to a nitrogen–oxygen mixture
and oxygen analyzer). The bottom of the chamber was covered with soda lime to
absorb CO2 and moisture. A nitrogen–oxygen mixture of 8±0.1% was injected to
the chamber at 1–2L/min for 2h. Then, the pups were returned to cages and fed by
female rats. For behavioral tests, rats were weaned at 21 days and maintained in
separate cages according to the gender.
2.6. Intracerebral transplantation
PBS, transgene NSCs and NSCs groups respectively received stereotaxic
injections of 2L stereotacticbuffer, or the buffer containinginfectedNSC (pGC-FUVEGF
;MOI=50TU/cells, 5×104 NSCs/L) or normal NSCs (5×104 cells/L) into the
left sensorimotor cortex 3 days after CP model establishment. Transplantation time
and location were based on a previous study [17]. Rats were held by a stereotaxic
apparatus,andthetransplantationsitewaslocatedinleftsensorimotorcortex(coordinates AP: −0.3mm, ML: −2mm, DV: −1.5mm; behind bregma 0.3mm, bregma
left 2mm, depth 1.5mm). The 2L solutions were injected using a perpendicular
micro-injector needle. The injection process took more than 5min and the needle
was kept in place for 5min after the injection. The scalp was sutured and rats were
returned to cages after rewarming.
2.7. Growth rate measurement
Body weight was measured between 8 and 10a.m. every day since CP model
was established. Litters were not culled. The growth rate was calculated using the
followingformula:growthrate(%)=(bodyweightonpostnatalday14–bodyweight
on postnatal day 7)/body weight on postnatal day 7×100%.
2.8. TUNEL staining
Brain tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), embedded in paraffin
and sectioned. TUNEL staining was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing,
sections were incubated in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme
at 37 ◦C for 1h in a humidified chamber. Sections were colorized with 0.06% 3,3-
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Negative controls were incubated in a TdT enzyme-free PBS solution. TUNEL-
positivecellswerecountedinanareathatcontained∼500cellsinthecorticalregion
oftheipsilateralhemisphere.Fiveareasfromeachofthefivesectionswereevaluated
for each animal.
2.9. Microvascular density (MVD) assessment in the cerebral cortex
MVD were assayed in the cerebral cortex according to the method of Weidener
[18]. In brief, microvascular endothelial cells were identified by their express of
cytoplasmic CD34 in the left (treated)-side of cerebral cortex that covers the NSC
injection side. CD34 immunohistochemistry was performed with a streptavidinperosidase (SP) method on the coronal section of the left-side brain. The negative
controlusedPBSinplaceoftheprimaryantibody(rabbitantimouseCD34).Asingle
vascular endothelial cells served as a vascular count. Five high-power (×400) visual
fields in each section of the same cortical ischemic area were selected for MVD
counting, and the mean represented the MVD.
2.10. Western blot analysis
Tendaysafterhypoxialischemia(HI),theischemicipsilateralhemisphereofthe
brains (approximately 100mg) was removed, homogenized in an extraction buffer
and used for western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a
UV spectrophotometer. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE,
which were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the
nitrocellulose membrane was immunoprobed overnight with an anti-VEGF antibody (1:1 000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4 ◦C. After
washing, the membrane was incubated with a HRP-conjugated antibody (1:2000)
for 1h at 37 ◦C, followed by three washes in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15min.
Boundantibodywasdetectedwithanenhancedchemiluminescencekit(Amersham,
USA).
2.11. Behavioral tests
Behavioraltestswereperformedusingablindmethodinaquietenvironmentat
a fixed location and times, as previously described by Balduini et al. [19]. For the T-
maze forced alternation test, rats (25 days of age, 17 days after HI) were habituated
for 2 consecutive days to the presence of food pellets (40mg) in a wooden T-maze
(11cm width×18cm height×40cm length). Guillotine doors were placed 15cm
from the end of the start box. Each trial consisted of a sample run and a test run.
In the sample run, a wooden block was placed at a selected point in the T-maze to
close off one arm. The rat was forced to enter the open arm and allowed to eat the
food pellets. The rat was then removed and confined to the start box for 15s. The

110 X.-r. Zheng et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 230 (2012) 108–115
guillotine doors in the start box and at the selected point in the T-maze were then
removed and let the rat performs the test run. During the run, the rat was deemed to
have made a choice by placing a hind foot in one of the two arms, and no retraction
of the foot was allowed. If the rat alternated (i.e., entered the arm not previously
visited in the sample run), the rat was allowed to eat the reward and then returned
to a cage. If the other arm was chosen (i.e., the same arm visited in the sample run),
the rat was confined to that arm for 10s and then returned to a cage. Between trials,
the forced choice procedure changed sides and alternated. Each rat underwent five
trials a day separated by an intermittent time of 15min for a total of four sessions
and completing 20 trials in total. Performances were recorded as a percentage of the
correct responses.
Forthefootfaulttest,ratsweretestedatpostnatalday34.Eachratwasplacedon
a horizontal grid floor (50cm×40cm, grid size 3cm×3cm, wire diameter 0.4cm).
A foot fault was defined as the rat misplacing a fore or hind limb with a paw falling
between the grid bars. The number of foot faults was recorded for 2min. Because
the animal’s movement and position may affect the chances of paw falling, only the
side difference of foot faults, which reflects the effect of one-side CP procedure, was
used for the statistical evaluation.
2.12. Histology
Average positive cell density in cortical and hippocampal CA1 regions was
obtained (cells/mm2). Three slices were analyzed for each rat and total of 12 rats
were analyzed for each group.
To evaluate the overall impacts of hypoxial ischemia and the subsequent NSC
transplantation on brain morphology, the neural cell density were examined in cortical and hippocampal CA1 regions at the end of experiment (35-day-old), as been
previously described [12]. Brain coronal sections (5m) were cut using a cryostat.
Cortical and hippocampal region slices were chosen for Nissl staining to evaluate
the neuron apoptosis and morphology. Ten sections from each hemisphere at an
interval of ∼400m were chosen for Nissl staining. Cell density determination was
performed in cortical and CA1 region slices by recording digital micrographs. Neurons were identified by Nissl staining and the number of stained nuclei was counted
in cortical and CA1 regions using confocal scanning microscopy software (LSM 510).
A systematic, random counting procedure was used, as previously described by
Williams [20]. Average positive cell density in the same area of cortical and hippocampal CA1 regions was obtained (cells/mm2) for each rat. Three slices were
analyzed for each rat and total of 12 rats were analyzed for each group.
2.13. Statistical analysis
Parametric data were expressed as the mean±SD. Data between groups were
compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey HSD
test if an overall significance was determined (P<0.05). T-maze test results were
analyzedbyatwo-wayANOVAfollowedbyTukeyHSDtesttoevaluategroupeffects
at each time point. The statistical comparison for the Foot fault test was performed
using a Kruskal–Wallis test. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Prevention of the growth delay by NSCs therapy
The growth rates of rats are shown in Fig. 1. A significant difference was found in the growth rate between control and PBS
groups (P<0.001), suggesting CP procedure significantly delayed
the growth of the animals. However, this delay was largely prevented by NSCs transplantations. The body weights in Transgene
NSCs and NSCs groups were significantly higher than that of
PBS group rats (P<0.01), and there was no significant difference
between Transgene NSCs and NSCs groups.

3.2. Detection of VEGF protein and neuronal apoptosis after
therapy
ToexaminehowCPprocedureandthesubsequentNSCstherapy
may affect VEGF expression in the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere
of rat brains, we examined the protein content by Western blots
(Fig. 2). Surprised, CP procedure, by itself, significantly elevated the
protein expression (PBS vs control group; P<0.001). Transplantation of NSCs increased the protein level even further (NSCs vs PBS
groups;P<0.01).Also,animalsreceivedTransgeneNSCswasbetter

NSCs groups; P<0.01).

significantly reduced in NSCs group rats compared with that of the
PBS group (P<0.01). Furthermore, animals received VEGF transfected NSCs did a little better than these with no-transfected NSCs
(P<0.05).
3.3. MVD count in the cerebral cortex
Angiogenesis is closely associated with neural regeneration.
To examine how CP procedure and the subsequent NSCs therapy
may affect angiogenesis, MVD was assessed. Vascular endothelial cells was detected by their expression of CD34 (Fig. 4). The
CD34 positive cells ands the bud- or fusiform-shaped microvessels
were significantly increased in CP animals from normal controls
(MVD, 4.94±0.55 in the control group vs 9.08±2.51 in the PBS
group; (P<0.01). However, NSCs therapy further increased the
MVD value to32.90±2.86 (P<0.01). Furthermore, Transgene NSCs
group did a little better than these that received no-transfected
NSCs (32.90±2.86 vs 41.38±4.19; P<0.01).
3.4. Improvement of long-term behavior after therapy

NSCs therapy may affect behavior (brain functions), T-maze forced

alternation and foot fault tests were carried out (Table 1). For T-
maze forced alternation test, trials were performed over a 4 day
period on animals 17 days after CP procedure. During the 4 day
trial period, animals from all groups appeared increased their performance overtime. However, in the first 3 days, there was no
significant difference (P>0.05) between the four groups. By day
4, the percent of correct responses was significantly lower in CP
animals (PBS) than that in control group (P<0.05). This decrease
was prevented by both NSCs transplantation groups (P<0.05),
with transgene group performing a little better than no-transgene
group.
Foot fault test can assess animals neural motor function by
comparing the difference between the performs of two legs.

Limb misplacements in control group rats were symmetrical.
The difference (right–left side) was 0.67±0.778 in the control group, 3.17±1.267 in the PBS group, 0.92±0.793 in the
Transgene NSCs group and 1.17±0.937 in the NSCs group. CP procedure significantly increased the difference between two legs
from that of control group (P<0.05). Both NSCs transplantation
groups largely prevented this increase (P<0.05). However, there
was no significant difference between Transgene NSCs and NSCs
groups.
3.5. Attenuation of brain damage after therapy
Fig. 5 shows that CP model establishment (PBS group) induced
significant degeneration and necrosis in the hemisphere ipsilateral
to the occluded carotid artery. Such procedure eventually resulted
in significantly fewer pyramidal cells in the CA1 regions of the
hippocampus.
The severe loss of pyramidal cells in CA1 regions of the
hippocampus, however, was significantly attenuated by NSCs
transplantation (PBS vs NSCs, P<0.01). Moreover, Transgene NSCs
transplantation completely prevented such loss (P<0.001).

4. Discussion
CP is the major perinatal cause of neurological morbidity in fulltermandpretermnewborns[21].MorechildrensufferfromCPthan
any other developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome,
epilepsy and autism. The disease also accounts for a large proportion of health care costs. Despite advances in perinatal monitoring,
obstetric and neonatal care, as well as in understanding of the
pathophysiology of perinatal asphyxia, the incidence of CP in childrenhasremainedessentiallyunchangedoverthelastfewdecades,
due to the lacks of reliable strategies to treat the disease. A better,
more effective way to manage the disease, therefore, becomes very
necessary [22].
Recently, there has been growing interest in the therapeutic
potential of NSCs for the treatment of brain damages [23]. Stem
cells have a number of properties, which make them excellent
candidates for the treatment of various neurologic disorders, the
most important of which being their ability to migrate to and
differentiate predictably at sites of pathology in the brain. The
disease-directed migration and well-characterized differentiation
patterns of stem cells may eventually provide a powerful tool for
thetreatmentofbothlocalizedanddiffusediseaseprocesseswithin
the human brain [24,25]. The research developments during the
past decade showed that NSCs transplantations were indeed effective in the treatment of multiple neural system disorders, at least
in experimental animals [26]. These disorders included neurogenetic lysosomal storage disease (LSD), mucopolysaccharidosis type
VII (MPS VII), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD),
multi-infarct dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS), and brain tumors.
The mechanisms underlying neuro-restorations in these studies
may be associated with at least two functions of NSCs; cell sources
forthestructurerepairandneuralregulatoryfactorstoassistantthe
recovery after insults. First, NSCs can engraft themselves diffusely
throughout the host central nervous system (CNS) and eventually
become integral members of the host through cell migration and
differentiation[25].Secondly,NSCsmayalsocontributethegrowth
factors and other molecules to create a micro-environment that
may help the host cells to address the challenges [26]. Therefore,
geneticmodificationofNSCsbeforetheirtransplantation,mayprovide another layer of benefits, cell replacement plus gene therapy

[23,27]. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of NSCs in the
treatment of CP in new born rats with both normal and genetic
modified cells
In the CNS, increasing evidence suggests that VEGF can directly
act on neurons and play an important neurotrophic and neuroprotective roles [28–30]. Studies have shown that angiogenesis and
nerve regeneration are closely related [31]. Regional angiogenesis
may establish nerve regeneration microenvironment for NCSs. The
important role played by VEGF in the process has been suggested
by many researchers over the years. For example, Le Bras and his
colleagues [32] have found that in both VEGF-C knockdown Xenopus tadpole and VEGF-C lacking mice, the proliferation of neural
progenitors was severely reduced, which may relate to the intracerebral blood vessel defects. Similarly, Roitbak and Cunningham
[33] have found that NSCs constitutively expressed hypoxiainducible factor 1a (HIF-1a) transcription factor and VEGF, both of
which were increased after the exposure of NSCs to oxygen and
glucose deprivations. The protective effects of NSCs on endothelial
cells under such stress were blocked by pharmacological inhibitors
of VEGF signaling, SU1498 and Flt-1-Fc, suggesting the direct
involvement of HIF-1a-VEGF signaling pathways in the process.
In our previous study [11], we have demonstrated that an adenoviralvector-mediatedtransfectionofVEGFinratbrainisbeneficial
in the prevention of hypoxia-ischemic induced brain damage. The
improved brain structure and behavioral and movement tests
suggested the neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities of the
transfected VEGF. However, we also found that the limited spatial
distribution of the viral vector appears to be a major cause of low
transfection efficiencies. NSCs, due to their migration ability and
ability to integrate into the host tissue, may provide a better tool to
deliver viral vectors directly to damaged brain regions, in addition
to their contribution as cellular sources.
In the present study, we demonstrated that NSCs transfected
with VEGF165 sustained their stable expressions after engraftment
into the damaged brain in vivo, which provided significant neuroprotection and improved the behavioral capacity of the animals.
The neuroprotective effect of this gene transfer is long lasting and
contributes to decreasing the severity of the pathophysiological

processes induced by ischemic insult. The significantly delayed
growth rate that resulted from the ischemic insult, were largely
prevented by NSCs transplantation, especially the Transgene NSCs,
suggesting that the brain defects that are associated with growth,
such as growth hormone secretion, may be prevented by NSCs
transplantation. VEGF secretion may play an important role in the
process that how the animals address the brain tissue insults. We
hypothesized that neuronal apoptosis could be attenuated by supplementingexogenousVEGFviaatransgenicapproach.Fig.2shows
that CP procedure, by itself, mildly increased VEGF protein content,
suggesting a compensatory response. The protein level was significantly increased further in no-transfected NSCs-engrafted rats,
indicating the capability of normal NSCs or their daughter cells of
secreting this factor. More interestingly, VEGF tranfected NSCs produced even higher level of the protein (transgene NSCs vs NSCs
groups),indicatingthatVEGFexpressionincreasedafterNSCswere
transfected with VEGF165.
Under physiological conditions, vascular development, angiogenesis and neuron development are closely associated [34]. Will
NSCs transplantations affect the vascular structure development
in CP animals? In this study, a CD34 monoclonal antibody against
vascular endothelial cells was used as a microvascular marker. We
found that NSCs transplantation not only increased the VEGF protein concentration, but also elevated the MVD in the rat cerebral
cortex.Moreinterestingly,NSCsthatwereinfectedwithVEGFgene
(Transgene NSCs) increases the MVD even more than that of notranfected NSCs, suggesting strongly that in addition to NSC as
cellular therapy, it also provided factors, such as VEGF, to modify
the microenvironment. Genetic modified NSCs thus provided extra
layer of benefits as gene therapy in neovascularization in damaged
brain tissue. In addition, apoptosis in the VEGF transgene therapy
group was also lower than these of NSCs and PBS groups.
In transgene NSCs group rats, in which exogenous VEGF was
overexpressed, TUNEL-positive cells were greatly attenuated and
the MVD of the cortex was significantly increased, suggesting that
theneuroprotectivemechanismsofNSCstransfectedwithVEGF165
may include a reduction of ischemic neuronal apoptosis and an
increase of cortical microvascular density. However, will these
changes in VEGF expression, cell apoptosis and microvascular density impact the neural density in the brain eventually? The answer
is yes. Nissl staining showed that neuron density in the hippocampus and cortex, that was greatly decreased by CP procedure, were
largely maintained by both NSCs transplantations, with transgene
NSCsbehavedmuchbetterthanno-transgeneNSCs,suggestingthat
VEGF gene delivery by engineered NSCs reduces neuronal apoptosisandimprovesthebehavioralcapacity.Theseresultsshowedthat
supplementingexogenousVEGFviatheengineeredNSCsdecreases
neuronal apoptosis and provides a neuroprotective effect to promote long-term neural functional recovery (see below).
Behavioral abnormalities represent the ultimate output of the
brain damages. These behavioral phenotyping provide functional
information that may not always be detectable by molecular, cellular and histological evaluations [35,36]. T-maze spontaneous
alternation is a functional test for measuring exploratory behavior
in animals, which has been extensively used to investigate specific
aspects of spatial working memory, particularly in rodent models
of CNS disorders. The T-maze test is based on the willingness of
rodents to explore a new environment. Rodents generally prefer
to visit a new arm of the maze rather than a familiar arm. In our
test-maze, rats needed to learn a rule to make the correct choice
for the arm that was previously closed in a forced run. Rodents
have evolved to explore their environment and obtain food with a
minimum amount of effort [37,38].
Numerous parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, septum
, basal forebrain and prefrontal cortex, are involved in spatial
memory. The T-maze test showed that rats in the transgene NSCs
group manifested long lasting and significantly increased spatial
discrimination, learning and memory recall capabilities compared
with those of NSCs and PBS groups. In addition, the results of the
behavioral tests of the NSCs group were improved compared with
that of the PBS group. A foot fault test assesses locomotor function
in rodent models of CNS disorders, which reflects the status of the
sensorimotor area in the cortex [38]. The foot fault testing showed
that the rats in transgene NSCs and NSCs groups manifested long
lasting and significantly increased locomotor function compared
with that of the PBS group.
In summary, our results demonstrate the efficacy of NSCs in the
treatment of CP in the neonatal rat. That fact that VEGF transfected
NSCs always believed a little better than no-engendered cells suggests that NSCs may help the brain to resist the insults through
twodifferentmechanisms;providingcellularresourcetoconstruct
the tissue and secreting paracrine factors to maintain a favorable
micro-environment. Overall, the results support the promise of
using NSCs as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neonatal
CP in human.
