SUMMARY
Objectives: Dynamically observe cerebral vascular changes in hyperglycemic rats in vivo
and explore the effect of diabetes on endothelial function after ischemic stroke. Background
: Diabetes affects both large and small vessels in the brain, but the dynamic process
and mechanism are unclear. Methods: We investigated the structural and functional
changes of brain vasculature in living hyperglycemic rats and their impact on stroke outcomes
via a novel technique: synchrotron radiation angiography. We also examined the
effect of prolonged fasudil treatment on arterial reactivity and hemorrhagic transformation.
Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated by streptozotocin to induce type 1 diabetes. These
hyperglycemic rats received fasudil pretreatment and then underwent transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion.Results:We found that diabetes caused arteries narrowing in the
circus Willis as early as 2 weeks after streptozotocin injection (P < 0.05). These vessels were
further constricted after middle cerebral artery occlusion. L-NAME could induce regional
constrictions and impaired relaxation in hyperglycemic animals. Furthermore, hemorrhagic
transformation was also increased in the hyperglycemic rats compared to the control
(P < 0.05). In fasudil-treated rats, the internal carotid artery narrowing was ameliorated
and L-NAME-induced regional constriction was abolished. Importantly, stroke prognosis
was improved in fasudil-treated rats compared to the control (P < 0.05).Conclusions:Our
dynamic angiographic data demonstrated that diabetes could impair the cerebral arterial
reactivity. Prolonged fasudil treatment could attenuate arterial dysfunction and improve
the prognosis of ischemic stroke by affecting both the large and small vasculature.
Introduction
Diabetes is an important risk factor for stroke. The incidence of
ischemic stroke in diabetic patients is about twofold to sixfold
higher than patients without diabetes [1]. In addition, the occurrence
of hemorrhagic transformation following r-tPA treatment
after ischemic stroke is much higher in diabetic patients [2]. Diabetic
patients also have poorer prognosis during recovery phase
after ischemia [3].
Even though it is known that diabetes affects cerebrovasculature
[4], it is unclear how pre-existing vascular structural and
functional changes caused by diabetes impact on cerebral perfusion
and progression after stroke in real time. Diabetic vascular
dysfunction has been recognized as a vital mechanism contributing
to the progression of stroke [5–7]. Clinical investigations have
shown that vascular dysfunction is an independent predictor of
cardiovascular events [8–10]. Experimental studies also showed
that diabetes impairs the dilation of cerebral macro and microvessels
[11,12], which hindered compensatory collateral artery recruitment
and vasodilation after ischemia [7,13]. Therapeutic regulation
of vascular dysfunction could increase cerebral blood flow
and improve stroke outcome. Although many studies have
revealed vascular dysfunction in cortical arterioles, basilar [14],
and carotid arteries [15], our knowledge of vascular dysfunction is
refined to local and separated vessels, partly due to the lacking of
techniques to image brain cerebrovasculature in larger scale. Synchrotron
radiation X-ray angiography (SRA), as a novel technique
to visualize cerebral vasculature, has been developed recently
[16]. It was used to study macro- and microvascular changes in
coronary vessels in vivo, which suggests its potential in probing
cerebrovascular dysfunction in the early phase of diabetes [17].
Recent studies have shown that RhoA/Rho-kinase activity is
increased both in diabetes and in stroke, which could contribute
to increased vascular tone and decreased nitric oxide production
[18]. It was found that enhanced activity of Rho-kinase was associated
with impaired endothelium-dependent responses [19],

neutrophil-induced endothelial apoptosis [20], and blood–brain
barrier damage [21]. In contrast, inhibition of rho-kinase could
prevent vascular dysfunction [22], augment blood flow in cerebral
ischemia [23,24], and maintain blood–brain barrier integrity [25].
Although previous studies have confirmed that prolonged inhibition
of rho-kinase could attenuate vascular contractility [26] and
maintain endothelial function [20], there are few studies that clarify
its effects in diabetic cerebral complications.
In this study, we explored the diabetes-induced cerebrovascular
changes in deep brain vessels and its impact on stroke prognosis
using dynamic synchrotron radiation X-ray angiography. We
tested whether prolonged inhibition of Rho-kinase by fasudil, a
selective RhoA/Rho-kinase inhibitor, could ameliorate diabetesinduced
vascular dysfunction and improve the prognosis of stroke.
Materials and Methods
Induction of hyperglycemia and Fasudil Treatment
Animal experiment protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the School of Biomedical
Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China
(Permission number: Bioethics 2012022). This manuscript is compliant
with the animal research: reporting in vivo experiments
guidelines. Fifty-four adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Sippr-BK,
Shanghai, China) were divided into three groups: nonhyperglycemic
(n = 16), hyperglycemic (n = 22), and fasudil-treated
hyperglycemic groups (n = 16). Hyperglycemia was induced in
rats weighing 250–300 g by a bolus intraperitoneal injection of
streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg in citrate buffer, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA), while nonhyperglycemic group received buffer only.
The fasting blood glucose level was tested 1 week after STZ injection
and again at 1 day before transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) using a glucose analyzer (Bayer, Leverkusen,
Germany). Hyperglycemic rat was defined by a fasting blood glucose
concentration of over 15 mmol/L.
Fasudil-treated hyperglycemic group received intraperitoneal
fasudil daily (10 mg/kg, Chase Sun, Tianjin, China) from 1 week
after STZ administration to 2 days before transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO), a total of 19 days of treatment. Nonhyperglycemic
control and hyperglycemic group were treated with
the same amount of normal saline. Mean arterial blood pressure
was measured using the Visitech BP-2000 system (Visitech Systems
, Apex, NC, USA) before tMCAO.
Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
The animals were subjected to tMCAO 27 days after hyperglycemia
induction. The surgical procedure for tMCAO has been
previously described [27]. Briefly, rats were anaesthetized by
inhalation of isoflurane (2%, Abbot, Shanghai, China). Animals
were then positioned supinely on a heating pad (RWD Life
Science, Shenzhen, China) maintaining body temperature at
37  0.5°C. The left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid
artery (ECA), and pterygopalatine artery (PPA) were isolated
under an operating microscope (Leica; Wetzlar, Germany). A silicone-coated
4-0 suture (Dermalon, 1756-31, Covidien, Mansfield,
MA, USA) was gently inserted from the ECA stump to the internal
carotid artery (ICA) until it blocked the opening of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA). The success of occlusion was assessed by a
decrease of cerebral blood flow to less than 20% of the baseline
using Laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Lab; Moor Instruments,
Axminster, UK). After 90 min of ischemia, the suture was carefully
withdrawn and reperfusion was assessed by the restoration
of cerebral blood flow.
Angiography Protocol
Synchrotron radiation X-ray angiography (SRA) was conducted at
1 day after tMCAO at beamline BL13W in Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (SSRF). Imaging setup and procedures have
been described previously [16]. Briefly, the average beam
current was 245 mA, and X-ray energy was 33.3 keV. Animals
were anaesthetized by ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally) during the imaging process. A PE-10 tube was
inversely inserted into the ECA for injecting contrast agent. The
rat was placed perpendicular to the beam, and iodinated contrast
medium (Ipamiro, Shanghai, China) was injected into the CCA as
a bolus (160 lL at 100 lL/second) using an automated microsyringe
pump (LSP01-1A, Longer; Baoding, China). An X-ray
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (pixel size of 6.59
6.5 lm, frame frequency of 30 Hz, Hamamatsu Ltd., Hamamatsu
City, Japan) was used to record high-resolution real-time angiographic
images at a distance of 650 mm to the sample. Contrast
agent was administrated through external carotid artery by a
bolus injection (160 lL within 2 seconds) in our study. It was
noted that arterial administration was also adopted by another
group and they found that bolus injection did not cause a significant
pressure perturbation during image sequences [17].
After imaging baseline vasculature, Nx-nitro-l-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME; 50 mg/kg intravenous. bolus) was injected
through tail vein to inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and angiographic
images were taken at 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after
injection. Then fasudil (10 mg/kg iv. bolus) was also injected
through tail vein as a vasodilator and rats were imaged at 5, 15,
and 30 min after injection.
Assessment of Vessel Internal Diameter and
Cortical Vascular Density
Measurements of vessel internal diameter (ID) of the circus Willis
were conducted using image analysis software (ImageJ, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Vessel ID represents the
average of three independent measurements. Arterial stenosis was
defined as a decrease of arterial diameter to less than 70% of average
arterial diameter of normal Sprague Dawley rats.
To assess cortical microvascular perfusion, we measured the
vessel density of the perfusion angiogram. A short program
written in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was used to
identify perfused vessels from original SRA images. Briefly,
identical areas covering the cortical branches of MCA were
selected. Then, all angiographic images were de-noised under a
same threshold to obtain a legible vessel map. The vessel density
was defined as the percentage of pixels of vessels in total
pixels of each identical area. The vessel signals in each area
were summed and compared.

Measurements of Brain Lesion and Hemorrhage
Volume
The brains were transcardially perfused with saline and fixed by
4% paraformaldehyde before being removed to freeze in 80°C
isopentane. A series of 20-lm-thick coronal sections were cut and
mounted on slides, with an interval of 200 lm between each
section. A total of 15–39 frozen sections from each rat were
stained with cresyl violet (Sigma) and delineated by ImageJ.
Lesion volume between two adjacent sections was then calculated
as Equation 1. The hemorrhage volume was evaluated by
photographing the coronal sections as the same intervals as the
lesion volume including a ruler in the field as a reference. And the
hemorrhagic area of each section was measured with ImageJ and
calculated using Equation 1. Total lesion and hemorrhage volume
were derived as the sum of all volumes between each adjacent
section and presented as a percentage of the lesion ratio compared
with the contralateral hemisphere.

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Three consecutive sections with 200-lm intervals covering the
ICA branch were stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to
previously reported protocol [28]. Immunohistochemical staining
was conducted against rat-specific smooth muscle cell a-actin
(SMA, 1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to assess ICA smooth muscle
cell phenotype. Brain sections were incubated with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 10%
bovine serum albumin for 30 min, the brain sections were stained
with SMA at 4°C overnight. Sections were rinsed with PBS and
incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Slides were then visualized
with a fluorescent microscope (Leica).
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean  SD and percentage. Media
thickness, cross-sectional area, lesion, and hemorrhage volume
were assessed with an unpaired Student’s t-test using SPSS
16.0 (SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY, USA). One-way ANOVA was carried
out to assess within-group differences of arterial diameters,
followed by a two-tailed Student’s t-test to determine statistical
significance. A probability value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Animal Characteristics
The body weight of hyperglycemic rats significantly decreased
after STZ administration (Table 1,P < 0.01). Blood glucose significantly
increased at 2 weeks after STZ administration compared to
nonhyperglycemic control (P < 0.01) and maintained at a high
level until 6 weeks. Mean arterial pressure did not decrease until
4 weeks after STZ administration (P < 0.01).
Fasudil Preserved Endothelial Function in
Hyperglycemic Rats
Vascular diameters of each primary branches of the circus Willis
were measured from SRA images (Figure 1A). The diameters of
ICA, MCA, PCA, and ACA in hyperglycemic rats decreased significantly
compared to nonhyperglycemic control. Fasudil treatment
did not affect these diameters (Figure 1B). The percentage of ICA
stenosis progressed from 2 weeks (19%) to 6 weeks (38%) after
STZ administration (Figure 1C). NOS inhibitor L-NAME was used
to test the vascular constriction and relaxation function, and SRA
showed that the vessels of the circus Willis exhibited general constriction
with multiple marked focal constrictions after L-NAME
administration in hyperglycemic rats. In contrast, in fasudil-treated
group, the vessels of the circus Willis constricted without
apparent focal constrictions (Figure 1D). Vasodilator could reverse
focal constriction in hyperglycemic rats.
Fasudil Treatment Improved Stroke Prognosis in
Hyperglycemic Rats
Hyperglycemic rats exhibited adverse prognosis after tMCAO
compared to nonhyperglycemic control and fasudil treatment
improved stroke outcome. The mortality rate of hyperglycemic
rats after tMCAO is 23%, comparing to 0% in nonhyperglycemic
control, while it decreased to 11% in fasudil-treated group. Lesion
volume also increased significantly in hyperglycemic rats and
fasudil treatment reduced lesion volume (Figure 2A,B). About
73% of hyperglycemic rats exhibited intracranial hemorrhage
after tMCAO, compared to 0% in nonhyperglycemic control
rats, and the hemorrhage volume of hyperglycemic rats was
142.7  54.2 lm2. In fasudil-treated group, hemorrhage rate
was 43% and hemorrhage volume was 27.2  19.2 lm2
(Figure 2C,D).

tMCAO and measured vascular diameters of ICA, MCA, PCA, and
ACA in nonhyperglycemic, hyperglycemic, and fasudil-treated
hyperglycemic rats. Results showed that hyperglycemic rats had
significantly smaller vascular diameters compared to nonhyperglycemic
control after tMCAO. ICA diameter was larger in
fasudil-treated hyperglycemic rats than that in hyperglycemic rats
(Figure 3A,B), while the diameters of other vessels were not significantly
different between the two groups. Comparison of ICA
diameters before and after tMCAO showed that ICA diameter of
hyperglycemic rats decreased after tMCAO, while that of the nonhyperglycemic
and fasudil-treated rats remain unchanged (Figure
3C). Some hyperglycemic rats showed extreme constrictions

of ICA and the lowest diameter was 105 lm, comparing to
384 lm in the normal control. H&E staining of ICA in hyperglycemic
rats showed that the media–intima was thicker than that
in nonhyperglycemic control (9.8  1.0 lm vs. 6.4  0.8 lm).
Fasudil treatment reduced media–intima thickness to
7.2  1.1 lm (Figure 3E). The inner diameter of ICA measured
using H&E stained images was consistent with that measured
using SRA images (Figure 3F).
Fasudil Treatment Preserved Endothelial
Function and Maintained Cortical Perfusion after
tMCAO
To investigate the dysfunction of vascular contraction and relaxation
underlying hyperglycemic rats after tMCAO, we used LNAME
to probe vascular function. Blockade of NOS only caused a
slight decrease in vessel diameter in control group, while it evoked
focal constrictions in ICA in the hyperglycemic group. In addition,
L-NAME caused reduced vessel density in hyperglycemic rats,
while nonhyperglycemic- and fasudil-treated group both maintained
the opening of cerebral vessels (Figure 3G). Immunostaining
of ICA from both groups in vitro with SMA and DAPI showed
that the morphology of smooth muscle cell transformed from
spindle into elliptical shape, while the numbers of cell layers
remained the same (Figure 3H). Perfused vessel density of hyperglycemic
rats in cortex was much lower than control, while fasudil
treatment increased cortical vessel density of hyperglycemic rats
(Figure 4A,B).
Discussion
Our results revealed arterial stenosis and dysfunction of contractions
/relaxations in the early stage of diabetes, which contributed
to worsen prognosis after ischemic stroke. Prolonged fasudil treatment
ameliorated diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction and
improved stroke prognosis. Our data is the first to evaluate deep
brain cerebrovascular function in the early stage of diabetes and
explore its role in stroke in living animals. Importantly, our results
tested the possibility of preserving cerebrovascular function to
improve the prognosis of diabetic stroke.
Due to the difference of derivation, duration, and blood glucose
concentration among in vitro studies, the results about diabetes-induced
cerebrovascular myogenic tone and reactivity
changes were controversial. The PCA of normoglycemic rat
was reported to have decreased myogenic tone when exposed
to high glucose concentration [29], while others reported that
myogenic tone increased in PCA from type 2 diabetic rats [30].
Our research found that diabetic rats exhibited lower baseline
vessel inner diameter and focal constrictions after NOS inhibition
, supporting that diabetes contributed to higher myogenic
tone and reactivity in deep brain vessels [31]. While in contrast
to previous results that oxygen–glucose deprivation
reduced myogenic tone and slight reduction of the diameter of
MCA in diabetic rats [31], we found that stroke induced significant
reduction of arterial diameters in ICA, MCA, PCA, and
ACA. Diabetic vascular dysfunction was characterized by
impaired cerebral vasoreactivity. We found that focal constrictions
under vascular modulators could be another marker. Histological
analysis of the vessels showed that media–intima
thickness of ICA increased, while cross-sectional area remains
unchanged (data not shown). This suggests that the stenosis of
ICA might reflect real-time arterial constrictions of the vessel
other than increased thickness of the vessel wall.
Many studies indicated that type 1 diabetes showed impaired
NOS-dependent dilation of cerebral arterioles [32,33]. Furthermore
, diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction is critical to the prognosis
of stroke [7,11,19] and chronic resveratrol treatment,
losartan, and exercise training [34–36] restored NOS-dependent
vascular dilation in type 1 diabetes and even lessened ischemiainduced
brain injury in type 1 diabetes [37,38]. In our study, we

, because diabetic endothelial injury was widely studied
[5,39], we studied the basal diameter of arteries but not capillaries.

rats and may impair cerebrovascular regulation after stroke,
which was supported by decreased cortical vessel perfusion density
in living diabetic rats. This might explain why the effects of
increased cerebral vessels in diabetic rats were functionally limited
and cannot promote cerebral blood flow after stroke [7,31,40].
We did not observe any obvious atherosclerotic changes of cerebral
arteries in diabetic rats at 4 weeks after STZ injection. The
mean arterial pressure of diabetic rats dropped at 4 weeks after
STZ injection and previous study proved that vascular dysfunction
could be an important reason [17]. Dynamic vascular dysfunction
might be the cause of arterial stenosis of the circus Willis and the
decrease of perfusion arterioles in cortex. The decrease of cortical
vessel perfusion density was in agreement with previous report of
decreased vessel recruitment of coronary arteries in diabetic rats
[17]. Other studies have also reported that impaired cerebrovascular
regulation is detrimental to the progression of lesion and ensuing
hemorrhage and edema [41]. Therefore, the evidence from
our study further supported the necessity of improving vascular
function in diabetics.
We found that prolonged fasudil treatment before stroke ameliorated
vascular dysfunction and greatly improved the prognosis
of stroke, indicating that Rho-kinase may be involved in diabetic
complications. Previous study has demonstrated that diabetes can
enhance RhoA activity in vascular endothelial cells [20,42] and
Rho-kinase activity is correlated with diabetic vascular dysfunction
[19,22,39]. The activation of Rho/Rho-kinase pathway contributes
to endothelial dysfunction through negative regulation of
endothelial NOS [43,44], which plays an important role in worsening
stroke outcome [13]. ROCK knockout attenuates vascular
endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice [42]. Fasudil treatment
protected vascular endothelium and improve hemodynamics in
the diabetic retinopathy [20] and hyperlipidemic mice [24]. The
results from our investigation are consistent with the results from
these studies.
The recent studies of diabetes-induced vascular changes have
various limitations. Some investigated the vascular changes
in vitro to study the mechanisms of diabetic vascular changes
[20,45], at the cost of functional changes of cerebral vessels.
Others studied the vascular responses of cerebral arterioles in cortex
[11,19], while the connections of large vessels and small vessels
are unclear. SRA provided the tool for investigating the
cerebrovascular changes of the whole brain as well as the dynamic
functional responses of vessels right after ischemic stroke in living
animals.
In general, MAP was normal when measuring 8 weeks or 2–
3 months after diabetes induction [7,11]. Interestingly, other
study also found that MAP decreased 3 weeks after diabetes
induction [17]. Autoregulatory alterations in nervous and vascular
tone should be the main reason for the change of MAP [46].
We believed that the MAP change may be related to the animal
model. Although MAP decreased in the diabetic rats, SBP
increased at 4 and 6 weeks, which may be caused by the large
artery constriction.
There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, we do not
apply permanent MCAO model, which may be considered more
translational and informative. Although permanent MCAO is a
good model for translational study, transient MCAO, which models
ischemia–reperfusion injury in animals, is also important for
exploring the role of reperfusion injury on vascular function.
Many studies about improving vascular reactivity in diabetic rats
to reduce stroke damage were performed on tMCAO. So, we
choose tMCAO to model stroke in hyperglycemic rats. Secondly,
from clinical reality, glycemic control should be applied to our
study. Although tight glycemic control was adopted by clinical
practice, many basic researches did not apply it [11,34]. Conventional
strategies to control blood glucose level, like insulin and
exercise, have been found to contribute to improving vascular
function and reducing stroke damage. Therefore, we did not conduct
glycemic control. Thirdly, there was no real CBF data. We
agree that CBF data could support the results of vascular density.
But conventional measurements of CBF like Laser Doppler
flowmetry and new techniques such as laser speckle imaging and
two photon imaging could only be applied to detect the surface
blood flow but not whole MCA territory blood supply in living
rats. In contrast, our results reflected the whole brain vascular
density, so we did not use these data to support our results.
Fourthly, benefit was only seen by prestroke treatment of fasudil,
not poststroke. It would be better to compare the effects of fasudil
between prestroke and poststroke treatment. Study of the effects
of fasudil on acute treatment has been reported previously but the
study of its effect on prestroke treatment was unclear. Therefore,
we focused on prestroke preventional treatment. Lastly, underlying
mechanisms of fasudil beneficial effects were not investigated.
Studies demonstrated that fasudil ameliorated diabetes-induced

vascular damages through Rho-kinase inhibition [7,42]. Therefore
, further investigation of the pathways involved and mechanism
of fasudil function are needed. As Rho-kinase activity is
correlated with diabetic vascular dysfunction and ROCK knockout
attenuates vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice
[39,42], we postulate that Rho-kinase inhibition contributed to
the restoration of vascular function.
Conclusion
Our dynamic angiographic data demonstrated that diabetes
could impair the cerebral arterial reactivity. Prolonged fasudil
treatment could attenuate arterial dysfunction and improve the
prognosis of ischemic stroke by affecting both the large and
small vasculature.
