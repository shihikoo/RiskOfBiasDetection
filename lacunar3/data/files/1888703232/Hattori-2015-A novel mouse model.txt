Subcortical white matter (WM) is a frequent target of ischemic injury and extensive WM lesions are important substrates of vascular
cognitive impairment (VCI) in humans. However, ischemic stroke rodent models have been shown to mainly induce cerebral infarcts in

Implantation of an ameroid constrictor to the right CCA resulted in gradual occlusion of the vessel over 28 d, whereas placement of a
microcoil to the left CCA induced50% arterial stenosis. Arterial spin labeling showed a gradual reduction of cerebral blood flow over
28 d post operation. Such reductions were more marked in the right, compared with the left, hemisphere and in subcortical, rather than
the cortical, areas. Histopathological analysis showed multiple infarct damage in right subcortical regions, including the corpus callosum
, internal capsule, hippocampal fimbria, and caudoputamen, in 81% of mice. Mice displaying such damage performed significantly
poorer in locomotor and cognitive tests. The current mouse model replicates the phenotypes of human subcortical VCI, including
multiple WM infarcts with motor and cognitive impairment.

Introduction
Most lacunar infarctions develop in subcortical areas, including
white matter (WM) regions such as the internal capsule (IC) and
corona radiata. WM infarction damage results in deficits in motor
function, one of the major determinants of poor prognosis
after stroke. Several rodent models of ischemic stroke have been
established, including those involving middle cerebral arterial
occlusion, embolic stroke, and photothrombosis, which have
been used in the development of novel neuroprotective agents
(Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007;Jiwa et al., 2010). Nevertheless,
most clinical trials of agents have failed to produce any significant
reduction in infarct volume in stroke patients (Richard Green et
al., 2003;O’Collins et al., 2006). Most rodent models of ischemic
stroke induce infarct damage in the cerebral cortex. Thus, the
volume of cortical infarct damage has been used as a parameter in
assessing potential novel neuroprotective compounds in such
models (Gladstone et al., 2002). However, the beneficial effects of
such agents on cortical gray matter have not always translated
into clinical efficacy, presumably because the mechanism of ischemic
WM damage differs from that found in gray matter. In
addition, therapeutic efficacy in such models has tended to be
judged solely on the basis of early histological outcomes, i.e.,
infarct volume, within the first few days. However, in clinical
settings, behavioral outcomes at later time points are deemed
preferable measures of therapeutic benefit.
Another determinant of poor prognosis after stroke is poststroke
dementia. Multiple subcortical infarct damage is thought
to be a major determinant of vascular cognitive impairment
(VCI), the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer
’s disease. Approximately half of VCI cases are characterized
by subcortical vascular brain injury, including WM infarcts (Pantoni
and Garcia, 1995; Roma ´n et al., 2002; Ihara and Kalaria,
2014). Many rodent models have failed to replicate all characteristics
of VCI (Hainsworth and Markus, 2008). For instance, rat
hypoperfusion models have been generated by bilateral common
carotid artery (CCA) occlusion (Wakita et al., 1994) or by placing
ameroid constrictors (ACs) on the bilateral CCAs (Kitamura et
al., 2012), while mouse hypoperfusion models have been generated
by bilateral CCA stenosis (BCAS) using microcoils (Shibata

et al., 2004). However, WM rarefaction in such models has been
shown to be limited to the corpus callosum (CC), with no apparent
WM infarct damage. This contrasts with human VCI, where
ischemic stroke often develops in subcortical areas, such as the
WM and striatum, which are supplied by end arteries (Fisher,
1968).
We therefore sought to develop a mouse model of subcortical
WM infarct damage with cognitive impairment. As the BCAS
model induces mild ischemia (hypoperfusion) with only WM
rarefaction and implantation of ACs on the bilateral CCAs induces
severe ischemia with acute infarctions and low survival rate
(Hattori et al., 2014a), we applied a microcoil on the left CCA and
an AC on the right CCA to expose mice to an intermediate ischemic
insult. We hope that this animal model will herald important
breakthroughs in the development of novel treatments for
ischemic stroke and VCI.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 10–12 weeks (weighing 24–29 g;
Japan SLC) were used and given access to food and waterad libitum. All
procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal
experimentation from the ethical committee of the National Cerebral
and Cardiovascular Center. All surgery was performed under anesthesia
and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. We used moribund
conditions as humane endpoints during the survival study. The moribund
condition was defined as irreversible conditions leading inevitably
todeath.Signsofmoribundityincluded(1)lackofresponsivenesstomanual
stimulation, (2) immobility, and/or (3) an inability to eat or drink. In such
conditions, animals were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation.
Study design.C57BL/6J male mice were assigned into five groups based
on operative procedure: (1) asymmetric CCA surgery (ACAS) with an
AC (inner diameter, 0.5 mm; Tokyo Instruments) placed on the right
CCA and a microcoil (inner diameter, 0.18 mm; Samini) placed on the
left CCA (n25;Fig. 1A), (2) BCAS operation (Shibata et al., 2004;n
7), (3) unilateral CCA stenosis (UCAS) with a microcoil placed only on
the left CCA (n 6), (4) unilateral CCA gradual occlusion (UCAgO)
with an AC placed only on the right CCA (n6), and (5) sham operation
(n15). Temporal changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured
by laser speckle flowmetry (Omegazone; Omegawave) before and at 1, 3,
7, 14, and 28 d after ACAS, BCAS, UCAS, or UCAgO, and by arterial spin
labeling (ASL; 7 tesla, BioSpec 70/30 USR; Bruker BioSpin) before and at
1, 7, 14, and 28 d after ACAS. Brain MRI (BioSpec 70/30 USR) was
performed at 8, 15, 22, and 29 d after ACAS. Histologic evaluation of
infarct changes was performed at 14 and 32 d after ACAS, UCAS,
UCAgO,orshamoperation.Rotarodandwirehangtestswereperformed
at 14 d after ACAS or sham operation; Y-maze test was performed at 14
and 28 d after ACAS, UCAS, UCAgO, or sham operation; and Morris
water maze testing was performed at 28–32 d after ACAS, UCAS,
UCAgO, or sham operation.
Ameroid constrictor.The AC consists of a titanium casing surrounding
a hygroscopic casein material with an internal lumen. The casein component
gradually absorbs water and consequently swells, leading to predictable
narrowing and occlusion of the arterial lumen it encases. The
inner diameter was 0.5 mm, the outer diameter 3.25 mm, and the length
1.28 mm (Kitamura et al., 2012).
Surgical implantation of microcoil and ameroid constrictor. The mice
were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane. Through a midline cervical incision
, both CCAs were exposed and freed from their sheaths. Two 4-0
silk sutures were placed around the distal and proximal parts of the left
CCA. The artery was gently lifted by these sutures and placed between the
loops of the microcoil just below the carotid bifurcation. The microcoil
was implanted by rotation around the left CCA (Fig. 1A). An AC was
implanted surgically on the right CCA (Fig. 1A). The BCAS operation
procedure has been detailed previously (Shibata et al., 2004). Rectal temperature
was maintained between 36.5 and 37.5°C.
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements. Blood pressure and pulse
rate were noninvasively measured by the tail cuff method (Softron). The
measurement sites were the roots of the tail of mice. The five recordings
of blood pressure and pulse rate were averaged.
CBF measurement assessed with laser speckle flowmetry. Relative CBF
was determined by laser speckle flowmetry, which obtains highresolution
2D imaging and has a linear relationship with absolute CBF
values (Ayata et al., 2004). Recordings were performed through the skull
under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. The majority of periosteum,
which adheres to the skull, was removed with fine-tip forceps. For each
recording, the skull surface was wiped with saline-soaked gauze. Calibration
was performed with a calibration reference device (Calibrator S/N
080715-5; Omegawave) before each test. The mean CBF was measured in
identically sized ROIs (900 pixels), located 1 mm posterior and 2 mm
lateral from the bregma. These data reflect the CBF of the subsurface
microvessels in the brain with a depth of0.5 mm (Dong et al., 2011).
CBF values were expressed as a percentage of the preoperative value.
MRI. All MRI scans were performed on a 7 tesla horizontal boreimaging
system (BioSpec 70/30USR) equipped with a gradient system
capable of a maximum gradient amplitude of 669 mT/m and a slew rate
of 7989 T/m/s. Radio-frequency transmission was performed using an 86
mm inner diameter volume coil. Signal was detected using a fourchannel
, receive-only phased-array surface coil. The mice were anesthetized
using isoflurane (4% for induction and 1.5–1.8% for maintenance)
in 1.2 L/min room air mixed with 0.1 L/min oxygen. The animal was
placed in a prone position, and the head fixed with a custom-designed
head holder inside the magnet. Body temperature was monitored by
rectal thermometer and maintained with a warm waterbed and warm air.
Heart rate and respiratory rate were continuously monitored. T

directions; and scan time, 11 min 40 s. In diffusion tensor images, generalized
autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition technique was used
with an acceleration factor of 2. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
maps were calculated. 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography (MRA)
images were acquired using a fast, low-angle shot sequence with the
following parameters: TR/TE, 22.43/3.30 ms; number of averages, 1; matrix

tilted, optimized nonsaturating excitation pulse and flow compensation
were used. Maximum intensity projection images were reconstructed
using AZEWIN (AZE).
CBF measurement of coronal slices was performed using a flowsensitive
, alternating inversion recovery technique (Kim, 1995;Kim and
Tsekos, 1997), an ASL-based method. In each of the nonselective and
slice-selective experiments, 22 images with different inversion times were
acquired using the RARE sequence with the following parameters: RARE

128 128; FOV, 4.0 4.0 cm2; in-plane spatial resolution, 313 313
m2; slice thickness, 1.0 mm; and number of slices, 1. The following
inversion time values were used: 30, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700,
800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1950,
2100, and 2300 ms. Total scan time was 8 min 24 s. The CBF image was
calculated from the obtained 44 images using ParaVison 5.1 (Bruker
BioSpin). The CBF images of two coronal slices (bregma level and hippocampus
level; bregma level2.0 mm) were acquired. ROI analyses of
CBF images were performed using the Dr. View/LINUX R2.5.0 program
(Asahi Kasei Information System). In slice-selective inversion recovery
images with an inversion time of 30 ms and the corresponding slices of

preoperative value.
Histologic evaluation of ischemic changes. The mice were deeply anesthetized
with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (40
mg/kg) and perfusion fixed transcardially with 0.01 mol/L PBS, then 4%
paraformaldehyde. Mouse brains were removed and divided coronally at
the bregma, the bregma1 mm, and bregma2 mm through the hippocampus.
They were embedded in paraffin and sliced into 6-m-thick
coronal sections. Klu ¨ver–Barrera, and hematoxylin and eosin stains were
used to observe any histological changes including infarct changes. The
severity of the WM lesions was graded as normal (grade 0), disarrangement
of the nerve fibers (grade 1), the formation of marked vacuoles
(grade 2), and the disappearance of myelinated fibers (grade 3) as previously
described (Wakita et al., 1995). For immunohistochemical detection
, rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (a marker of astrocytes, 1:2000; DAKO),
rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (a marker of microglia, 1:200; Wako), rabbit
anti-GST-antibody (a marker of oligodendrocyte, 1:100; Merck Millipore
), mouse anti-neurofilament H nonphosphorylated (SMI32) antibody
(a marker of damaged axons, 1:1000; Sternberger Monoclonals),
and mouse anti- NeuN antibody (1:100; Merck Millipore) were used.
Percentage area of GFAP-positive astrocytes, Iba1-positive microglia,
GST--positive oligodendrocytes, and SMI32-positive axons in the CC
were calculated using the ImageJ software package (National Institutes of
Health).
In vivo imaging of CCA. After intravenous tail vein injection of fluorescein
isothiocyanate-dextran (2 106 molecular weight, 200lof20
mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), the AC-implanted right CCA was visualized
with a fluorescence microscope (MVX10; Olympus) at several time
points after the operation.
Rotarod test. The rotarod test was performed at 14 d after ACAS or
sham surgery by placing the mouse on a rotating drum (Muromachi
Kikai) and measuring the time the mouse maintained its balance on the
rod, as previously reported (Shibata et al., 2007). Rotarod speed was
accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over a 5 min period. The test was repeated
five times with an interval of 5 min between attempts.
Wire hang test.The wire hang test was performed at 14 d after ACAS or
sham surgery, as previously reported (Shibata et al., 2007;Hattori et al.,
2014b). A metallic wire (2 mm 60 cm) was secured to the top of a
transparent, rectangular open-topped plastic box (30 cm height60 cm
width40 cm length). The wire was tightly fixed to the top of the tank to
avoid vibration, which could interfere with the performance of the
mouse. Mice were placed on the metallic wire and latency to fall was
recorded. This was repeated five times with an interval of 5 min between
attempts. Mean latency to fall was determined.
Y-maze test. Spatial working memory and spontaneous activity were
assessed by the Y-maze test, as described earlier (Washida et al., 2010).
The Y-maze test was conducted during the dark period (7–11 pm) at 14
and 28 d after ACAS, and 28 d after UCAS, UCAgO, or sham surgery. The
maze consists of three identical arms (40 cm long, 9.5 cm high, and 4 cm
wide), labeled A, B, or C, diverging at 120° angles from a central point.
The experiments were performed in a dimly illuminated room. After
each mouse was tested, the floor of the maze was cleaned using super
hypochlorous water-soaked paper for the elimination of smell to avoid
olfactory cues. Each mouse was placed at the end of the start arm and
allowed to move freely through the maze during an 8 min session without
reinforcers such as food, water, or electric foot shock. The sequence of
arm entries was manually recorded. A mouse was considered to have
entered an arm when all four paws were positioned in the arm runway.
An alternation was defined as entry into all three arms on consecutive
occasions (e.g., the sequence, ABCBCBCA was counted as two alternations
, with the first consecutive ABC and the last consecutive BCA out of
six consecutive occasions; 33% alternations). The maximum alternation
was calculated as the total number of arm entries minus two, and the
percentage of alternation was calculated as (actual alternation/maximum
alternation) 100. The total number of arms entered during
the sessions, which reflects spontaneous activity, was also recorded.
Mice that entered arms less than eight times during the test were
eliminated because their data were not considered to reflect precise
alternation.
Morris water maze test. The Morris water maze test was performed at
28–32 d after ACAS, UCAS, UCAgO, or sham surgery as previously
reported (Hattori et al., 2014b). It consists of a circular pool (diameter,
120 cm; depth, 40 cm) and a set of video analysis systems (EthoVision
XT5; Noldus). The pool was filled with water containing nontoxic white
paint to a depth of 30 cm. A clear, circular platform (diameter, 8 cm) was
submerged 1 cm below the water surface in the center of one quadrant of
the pool (target quadrant). A red cross sign and blue upward arrow at the
opposite side of the red cross sign were used as orientation cues for
swimming. On the first 4 d, we performed four trials per day witha5min
interval between attempts (acquisition phase). The platform was kept in
the same position during the acquisition phase. Mice were placed at the
starting position (the quadrant adjacent to the target one; cf. Fig. 8C,
Zone 2) and released into the water. Each mouse was allowed to swim for
60 s, discover the hidden platform, and climb onto it. The trial was
immediately terminated after the mouse arrived on the platform or after
60 s had elapsed. When a mouse succeeded in climbing onto the platform
, it was permitted to remain there for 10 s. If a mouse did not reach
the platform within 60 s, it was placed there and allowed to remain for
15 s. Latency to reach the platform (escape latency) and mean swimming
speed were recorded. On the fifth day (the last day), the mice were subjected
to the probe trial session in which the platform was removed from
the pool and the mice were allowed to swim for 60 s to search for it. The
duration of swimming in each quadrant was recorded.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using StatView
(SAS Institute). All values are expressed as meansSEM in the figures.
Data were analyzed by unpairedttest unless noted otherwise. Differences
withp0.05 were considered statistically significant in all analyses.
Results
Gradual narrowing of right CCA subjected to AC
Placement of the AC on the right CCA produced the expected
narrowing of the inner lumen (Fig. 1B). The AC gradually narrowed
up to 28 d post operation and finally occluded (Fig. 1B).In
vivo vessel imaging with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran
showed lack of fluorescence within the right CCA proximal to the
AC at day 28 post implantation of AC, indicating that blood flow
ceased proximal to AC (Fig. 1C).
Mortality rates
The mortality rate in the ACAS group was 20.0% (5/25), while all
mice survived until 28 d post operation in the BCAS, UCAS,
UCAgO, and sham surgery group. In the nonsurviving ACAS
mice, the laser speckle flowmetry finally showed significant reductionsofCBF20–30%ofthebaselinelevelreflectingmassive
infarctions or hemodynamic derangements (data not shown).
Mean blood pressure and pulse rate of surviving mice
The mean blood pressure did not differ significantly among the
three groups after 28 d following each operation (ACAS, 71.3
1.9 mmHg; BCAS, 71.51.8 mmHg; sham operation, 71.12.2
mmHg), and pulse rate was not significantly different among the
three groups (ACAS, 65625 bpm; BCAS, 67920 bpm; sham
operation, 68127 bpm).
Temporal profiles of cortical surface CBF recorded by laser
speckle flowmetry
At 1 d after BCAS operation, cortical surface CBF sharply
dropped to 72.4% of the baseline level, and started to recover at
3 d and reached to 82.5% at 28 d. In contrast, in the ACAS group,
the acute phase observed in the BCAS group was abolished, and
the CBF was significantly higher than the CBF of the BCAS group
at 1 d (microcoil side, 83.7%; AC side, 87.2%) after operation.
However, CBF in the ACAS group continued to decrease and was
significantly lower than that of the BCAS group at 7 d after oper-

ation (microcoil side, 74.2%; AC side,
64.3%). CBF at the microcoil side nearly
plateaued thereafter until day 28, while
CBF at the AC side slightly recovered after
day 7 and approached the level at the microcoil
side at day 28 (microcoil side,
75.3%; AC side, 73.4%). The levels of CBF
of the ACAS group on days 14 and 28 were
significantly lower than those of the BCAS
group. A significant right-to-left difference
in the CBF level was observed only at
day 7 of the ACAS group (Fig. 2A,B).
Mice with UCAS showed no change in
CBF but mice with UCAgO showed gradual
reduction of CBF up to 91.0% of the
baseline level at day 28 after surgery (Fig.
2B).
Temporal profiles of regional CBF
recorded by ASL
To explore CBF in deep brain structures
after ACAS, we performed ASL pre- and
post-ACAS. On the AC side, cortical and
subcortical CBF gradually decreased up to
28 d after ACAS (Fig. 2C–E). Notably,
subcortical CBF levels were consistently
lower than cortical CBF at both the
bregma and hippocampal levels. At the
bregma level, subcortical CBF was 17% of
the baseline CBF and the cortical CBF was
24% on the right AC side at day 28. On the
left microcoil side, this tendency was also
observed; at the bregma level, the subcortical
CBF was 38% and the cortical CBF
was 43% at day 28. Furthermore, cortical
and subcortical CBF levels on the AC side
tended to be lower compared with those
on the microcoil side after 14 and 28 d
post-ACAS (Fig. 2C–E). The right subcortical
areas on the AC side were most vulnerable
to deranged hemodynamics after
ACAS.
Brain MRI showed fresh
cerebral infarction
Diffusion- and T2-weighted images
showed multiple high-intensity signal areas
in the CC, CPu, IC, and hippocampal
fimbria (HF) but not in the cerebral cortex
at day 8 after ACAS. The ADC map
showed low values in the same areas, indicating
the development of fresh infarcts. Moreover, TOF MRA
showed an absence in signal from the right internal carotid artery
(ICA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), reflecting that the
flow speed or volume decreased in the right ICA and MCA
(Fig. 3).
Histological changes
The BCAS group did not reveal any infarcts throughout the brain
after operation, as previously reported (Shibata et al., 2004).
However, in the ACAS group, 88% of mice showed ischemic
stroke at 14 d after operation (n 8), and 75% of mice at 32 d
after operation (n8). Multiple infarcts developed in subcortical
areas such as the CC, CPu, IC, and HF, in 81% of mice (13/16)
on only the right AC side at 14 and 32 d after operation: ischemic
stroke developed in 11 mice (69%) in the CC, 7 mice (44%) in the
IC, 10 mice (63%) in the HF, and 11 mice (69%) in the CPu.
Cortical infarcts appeared in five mice (31%), and accounted for
15.6% of all infarcts developed in ACAS mice, at 14 and 32 d after
operation. There were numerous accumulations of Iba1-positive
microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes in all infarctions apparent
after hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 4). Hippocampal
neuronal loss was seen only on the right AC side in 69% of ACAS
mice, but not the left microcoil side. Activated microglia surrounded
the area of neuronal loss in the hippocampus (Fig. 5).

In contrast, no infarcts were present on the microcoil side by
32 d after operation. Histopathological analysis of the CC and the
anterior commissure with Klu ¨ver–Barrera staining showed grade
0 or grade 1 damage at 14 d after operation, but after 32 d, moderate
to severe rarefaction (grade 2–3) occurred in these regions.
In contrast, the WM changes in the optic tract were less severe
than in the CC and the anterior commissure until day 32 (Fig.
6A). The demyelination in the CC was accompanied by significant
proliferation of GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba1-positive
microglia in ACAS mice compared with sham-operated mice.
The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was similarly greater
than sham mice at days 14 and 32, while the Iba1-positive microglia
continued to increase from day 14 to 32. The amount of
GST--positive oligodendrocytes tended to decrease in the
ACAS mice compared with the sham-operated mice at days 14
and 32. In addition, in ACAS mice, SMI32-positive damaged
axons significantly increased at day 32 compared with those at
day 14 after ACAS and sham-operated mice (Fig. 6B). The histological
findings of sham-operated mice were comparable to those
of mice with UCAS or UCAgO, supporting the findings that
UCAS or UCAgO induced only minimal changes in CBF levels.
Rotarod test and wire hang test for motor function
assessment
The rotarod test showed that latency to fall was significantly
shorter in the ACAS group at day 14, compared with the sham
group, indicating that motor coordination and balance were significantly
impaired in the ACAS mice (Fig. 7A). Similarly, a significantly
shorter latency to fall was found in wire hang testing in
the ACAS group compared with the sham-operated mice at day
14, indicating that muscle strength was significantly impaired in
ACAS mice (Fig. 7B).
Y-maze test for spatial working memory and spontaneous
activity assessment
We examined whether the ACAS mice showed impairment in
spatial working memory and spontaneous activity using the
Y-maze test. In the ACAS group, the percentage of alternation
behaviors (used as an indicator of spatial working memory) was
not decreased at day 14 but significantly decreased at day 28,
compared with the UCAS, UCAgO, or sham-operated mice. This
indicates that ACAS mice specifically show spatial working memory
impairment, suggesting that combinational placement of a
microcoil and an AC on each respective CCA induces a synergistic
effect but that unilateral microcoil or AC alone is not sufficient
to induce working memory impairment. The number of arm
entries of ACAS mice tended to increase compared with that of
the UCAS, UCAgO, or sham-operated mice at days 14 and 28
after each operation. This indicated that spontaneous activity
may be increased, rather than decreased, as a result of hyperactivity
in ACAS mice (Fig. 7C).
Morris water maze test for reference memory assessment
We next examined whether the ACAS mice showed spatial learning
and reference memory impairment using the Morris water
maze test. The ACAS mice exhibited longer escape latencies than
the sham-operated mice throughout the acquisition phase (Fig.
8A). In particular, ACAS mice failed to learn platform location
during the second half of the acquisition phase. The swimming
speed did not differ between four groups during the acquisition
phase (Fig. 8B). In the probe trial, ACAS mice spent a similar
duration of time in every quadrant, including Zone 1 (the target
quadrant), while sham-operated mice spent a significantly
greater time in Zone 1 than in the other quadrants (Fig. 8C).
Examination of traces of swimming paths in the probe trial
showed that sham-operated mice selectively searched the correct
quadrant but ACAS mice did not (Fig. 8D). These results indicated
that ACAS mice show hippocampus-dependent reference
learning and memory impairment, reflecting existing hippocampal
neuronal loss. The UCAS mice exhibited significantly shorter
escape latencies than the ACAS mice throughout the acquisition
phase and spent a significantly greater time in the target quadrant
in the probe trial, while the UCAgO mice had a tendency for
shorter escape latencies than the ACAS mice (p0.06) and spent
a significantly greater time in the target quadrant in the probe
trial (Fig. 8). These results indicated that combinatorial placement
of a microcoil and an AC on each respective CCA induced
synergistic effects on spatial learning and reference memory
impairment.
Discussion
By applying a microcoil on the left CCA and an AC on the right
CCA, we have successfully established a novel mouse model of
long-term hypoperfusion (named the ACAS model), which results
in a gradual decrease in CBF in both hemispheres, with the
maximum decrease in the right subcortical area. Subsequently,
multiple ischemic strokes developed in the right subcortical area,
including the deep WM and the hippocampus, which are areas
vulnerable to cerebral ischemia in humans. In the left hemisphere
(microcoil side), CBF decrease was milder but WM rarefaction
and gliosis were induced instead of ischemic stroke. Based on
these histological changes, the ACAS model showed motor incoordination
and neuromuscular weakness at 14 d and cognitive
impairment at 28 d after operation. The ACAS model thus represents
a novel animal model that replicates predominant WM
infarcts accompanied by motor deficits and dementia, namely
subcortical VCI.
The volume of WM in rodents, such as mice and rats, occupies
only 10–15% of whole brain. Therefore, replicating selective WM
infarcts in rodents possesses considerable difficulties. Thus far,
most existing mouse models of ischemic stroke, such as the permanent
/transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model, predominantly
result in infarct damage to gray matter regions. Thus,
previous histopathological studies of pharmacological agents
against acute stroke in rodent models have mainly focused on
evolutional changes in microscopic morphology of the gray matter
, especially in the cerebral cortex (Dewar et al., 1999). This may
explain the failure of clinical trials using neuroprotective drugs
for the treatment of acute stroke, contrasting with4000 publications
describing 700 agents found to be neuroprotective in preclinical
studies (Kaste, 2005). For example, NMDA receptor and
Ca2	receptor antagonists have so far failed in clinical evaluation
for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (Davis et al., 2000;
Albers et al., 2001; Horn and Limburg, 2001; Sacco et al., 2001),
despite preclinical promise. As only neurons have NMDA recep-

tors, and voltage-sensitive Ca2	 channels are predominantly
found in the cortex, cortical ischemic injury (e.g., neuronal injury
or neurotoxicity) is mainly caused by excessive activation of
NMDA receptors with excess glutamate and Ca2	 over influx
into neurons (Kitagawa, 2012). However, in the WM, nodes of
Ranvier are rich in voltage-dependent Na	channels. Therefore,
the NMDA receptor and Ca2	receptor antagonists give the impression
of having little effect on the WM ischemic injury, comprising
of edema through excess influx of Na	to the axons.
Relatively few animal stroke models accurately replicate WM
infarct damage. Among them is an endothelin-1 (ET-1) injection
model, in which ET-1, a potent and long-acting venous and ar-

terial vasoconstrictor (Masaki and Yanagisawa, 1992), is injected
into WM to produce focal subcortical stroke (Gilmour et al.,
2004). This approach may directly induce focal infarction in deep
brain compartments. However, there are some drawbacks in this
model. Craniectomy is necessary for stereotaxic application of
ET-1, which may cause trauma along the needle track, possibly
leading to myelin disruption without overt loss of myelin
(Hughes et al., 2003). In addition, ET-1, ET-1-converting enzyme
, and two subtypes of ET-1 receptors are expressed not only
on vascular endothelial cells but also on neurons and astrocytes in
the brain (Nakagomi et al., 2000;Naidoo et al., 2004); therefore,
ET-1 may induce astrocytosis and interfere with axonal regeneration
in neural repair experiments (Uesugi et al., 1996, 1998).
Alternatively, WM stroke animal models have been generated by
anterior choroidal artery occlusion in rats and pigs (He et al.,
1999,2000;Tanaka et al., 2008) but have been undermined by the
inherent technical difficulties of intracerebral artery occlusion in
such animals.
The current mouse model induced multiple infarcts in the
paramedian part of CC, CPu, IC, and HF. These sites correspond
approximately with the internal watershed territory, which is located
in the WM along and slightly above the lateral ventricle
between the deep and superficial arterial systems of the MCA
(Dorr et al., 2007). The CC, IC, and CPu at the bregma level are
located between perfusion territories of MCA branches, namely
MCA cortical branches and anterior/posterior striate arteries.
The HF, CC, IC, and CPu at the hippocampal level are located
between MCA cortical branches and ICA branches including the
dorsolateral thalamic and anterior choroidal arteries (Dorr et al.,
2007). Such arterial border zone areas were therefore most susceptible
to deranged hemodynamics in this model.
The existing rodent models of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion
partially recapitulate subcortical VCI by developing WM rarefaction.
For instance, the BCAS mouse model shows WM-specific
damage such as rarefaction, glial activation, and axonal damage
(Shibata et al., 2004;Coltman et al., 2011). This model is thought
to be the most promising model of VCI (Bink et al., 2013)as
working memory is reproducibly impaired at 28 d after microcoil
placement on bilateral CCAs (Shibata et al., 2007;Coltman et al.,
2011). However, other characteristics of subcortical VCI, such as
WM or striatal lacunar infarcts, as well as gradual CBF reduction,
are not replicated. The BCAS mouse model and two-vessel occlusion
rat model are generated by manipulations of the CCAs; however
, its inherent limitations include an acute drop in CBF, which
is followed by compensatory recovery of CBF (Ihara and Tomimoto
, 2011). This factor may therefore lead to contention in
determining whether WM rarefaction has been induced by acute
drop of CBF or by chronic hypoperfusion (Kitamura et al., 2012).

In contrast, the current mouse model more precisely replicates
the human disease characteristics in terms of temporal CBF
profile and ischemic brain regions. Subcortical VCI is characterized
by decompensated ischemic changes, which gradually occur
as age advances, subsequently leading to chronic ischemic
changes in the WM and basal ganglia with resultant cognitive
impairment. An MRI-pathological correlation study of VCI cases
has suggested that the WM pathological damage consists of heterogeneous
combinations of myelin loss, axonal loss, scattered
small infarcts, and astrogliosis (Udaka et al., 2002; Jellinger,
2007). Therefore, the current model more precisely mimics such
disease processes and characteristics of subcortical VCI and can
be used to develop a novel strategy to tackle VCI.
One of the most plausible explanations for the successful generation
of ischemic lacunar-like small infarctions in the current
hypoperfusion model was that gradual CBF reduction might
have circumvented a strong compensatory mechanism. There
was a clear contrast in the brain-surface CBF profiles between the
ACAS and BCAS models; the CBF reduction reached 60% of the
baseline level, with gradual reduction by 7 d after ACAS operation
, while CBF in the BCAS model started to recover as early as
the next day after the operation (see Fig. 2B). The gradual CBF

reduction was successfully generated in the rat two-vessel gradual
occlusion model by using the ACs, but the degree of CBF reduction
was milder in rats because of the relatively well developed
posterior communicating arteries, compared with the C57BL/6
mice (Kitamura et al., 2012). In the current model, therefore, the
compensatory mechanism may have been minimized and CBF
reduction maintained for a period of time sufficient enough to
induce infarctions in the areas with an end-artery vascular
supply.
Another advantage of using the current model would be rightto-left
comparison of efficacy of certain drugs to ischemia because
of the difference in ischemic depth between hemispheres.
The right hemisphere mimics characteristics of multiple subcortical
infarcts and the left hemisphere those of leukoaraiosis, sequelae
to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The prompt and
reproducible generation of small subcortical infarcts, as well as
leukoaraiosis, in a timely manner would be an advantage in the
analysis of subcortical VCI pathophysiology and search for drugs
that target WM changes.
Subcortical VCI can be accompanied by a wide range of neurological
deficits. Symptomatic lacunes may present with acute
sensorimotor deficits (pure motor hemiplegia, pseudobulbar
palsy, and other lacunar syndromes) before subacute manifestations
, such as cognitive impairment, personality and mood disorders
, develop (Roma ´n et al., 2002). Our current study
demonstrates that ACAS-induced impairment in locomotor activity
at 14 d after operation and working and reference memory
impairment later at 28 d. This time course of phenotype development
in the ACAS model may correspond with the clinical complications
of subcortical VCI.
This study has a limitation in that ACAS mice did not develop
microvasculature pathology, while most human VCI result from
pathology of microvasculature due to hypertension, diabetes,
and genetic factors such as cerebral arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Further analysis using the
ACAS procedure applied to various model mice with some liferelated
or genetic vascular risk factors including hypertension,
diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia is thus warranted.
In summary, a novel mouse model of subcortical VCI has
been established, which causes gradual CBF reduction, accompanied
by small lacunar infarcts in the areas supplied by end arteries
, with subsequent cognitive impairment. We therefore believe
this model could be used in the exploration of new treatments for
VCI and coexisting neurological complications.
