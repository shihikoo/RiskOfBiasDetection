Only a minority of stroke patients receive thrombolytic therapy. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies focusing on neuroprotection
are under review, among which, inhibition of the proteasome is attractive, as it affects multiple cellular pathways. As
proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib have severe side effects, we applied the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118, which is
putatively better tolerated, and analysed its therapeutic potential in a mouse model of cerebral ischaemia. Stroke was induced in
male C57BL/6 mice using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion model. BSc2118 was intrastriatally injected 12 h
post-stroke in mice that had received normal saline or recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator injections during early reperfusion.
Brain injury, behavioural tests, western blotting, MMP9 zymography and analysis of angioneurogenesis were performed
for up to 3 months post-stroke. Single injections of BSc2118 induced long-term neuroprotection, reduced functional impairment,
stabilized blood–brain barrier through decreased MMP9 activity and enhanced angioneurogenesis when given no later than 12 h
post-stroke. On the contrary, recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator enhanced brain injury, which was reversed by BSc2118.
Protein expression of the transcription factor HIF1A was significantly increased in saline-treated and recombinant
tissue-plasminogen activator-treated mice after BSc2118 application. In contrast, knock-down of HIF1A using small interfering
RNA constructs or application of the HIF1A inhibitor YC1 (now known as RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting
protein 1 (RBMS1)) reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection. Noteworthy, loss of neuroprotection after combined treatment
with BSc2118 and YC1 in recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-treated animals was in the same order as in saline-treated
mice, i.e. reduction of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator toxicity through BSc2118 did not solely depend on HIF1A.
Thus, the proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 is a promising new candidate for stroke therapy, which may in addition alleviate
recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-induced brain toxicity.

Introduction
Thrombolytic therapy of ischaemic stroke is limited by a narrow
time window and by side effects of the thrombolytic recombinant
tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (Lees et al., 2010). Novel
approaches that might overcome these side effects and extend
the therapeutic time window of the latter are, therefore, urgently
needed. However, most neuroprotective drugs that were successful
in animal models have so far failed in clinical trials (Dirnagl,
2006). As modulation of single specific pathways is inferior
in experimental stroke therapy, interference with multimodal cell
cascades is advantageous (Rogalewski et al., 2006). Thus, the
ubiquitin proteasome system is an ideal candidate for drug therapy
, as it is involved in multiple cellular pathways (Dahlmann,
2007).
The proteasome is a multicatalytic protease complex that contains
the catalytic 20S core complex with three distinct activities
(Rivett, 1993; Goldberg, 1995). Proteasomes are found in the
cytosol and the nucleus of mammalian cells, being the predominant
non-lysosomal machinery for protein turnover. As such, proteasomes
are critically involved in various physiological and
pathological processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription
, cell signalling and inflammation. Pharmacological proteasome
inhibition for the treatment of various diseases, such as
ischaemia reperfusion injury, has gained increasing interest in
recent years (Elliott and Ross, 2001; Kukan, 2004; Di Napoli and
McLaughlin, 2005; Dahlmann, 2007; Petroski, 2008).
Proteasome inhibition has been shown to induce short-term
neuroprotection against cerebral ischaemia in rodents. Among
the different proteasome inhibitors used, CVT-634 was the first
to achieve neuroprotection for as long as 7 days, albeit underlying
mechanisms were not analysed at that time (Buchan et al., 2000).
On the other hand, the lactacystin derivative MLN519 (also
known as PS-519) induced neuroprotection by inhibiting
pro-inflammatory nuclear factor-B when given no later than
4–6 h post-stroke (Phillips et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Berti
et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2003). Likewise, the well-known
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade, also known as
PS-341) reduced infarct size and post-ischaemic inflammation
when given as monotherapy 2–4 h after stroke (Henninger
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006, 2010).
Although proteasome inhibition against stroke has not yet
reached clinical application, the (partially) reversible proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle
cell lymphoma. However, treatment with bortezomib is limited
because of severe side effects and drug resistance (Ruschak
et al., 2011), indicating the urgent need to introduce new and
better tolerable proteasome inhibitors. Consequently, we have
recently developed the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118,
which shows significant anti-myeloma activity associated with a
broad therapeutic range (Braun et al., 2005; Sterz et al., 2010).
In the present work, we applied BSc2118 in a model of transient
focal cerebral ischaemia in mice and analysed mechanisms underlying
BSc2118-induced neuroprotection.
Materials and methods
Animals and injection protocols
All experimental procedures were performed according to European
Union guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and
were approved by local authorities. Experiments were performed on
adult male C57BL/6N mice (Charles River). Treatment of mice was
blinded to investigators. The number of animals used, including
non-ischaemic mice, was 444. Numbers of animals used for each
experiment are given in the figure legends. Survival rate was 100%
for animals surviving a maximum of 4 days, whereas survival rate was
84.6–100% in animals that survived for 28–84 days after induction of
stroke. An outline of the in vivo experiments is given in Supplementary
Fig. 1.
Injection of the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 (dissolved in
100% dimethyl sulphoxide), which was synthesized and provided by
Petra Henklein (Institute for Biochemistry of the Charite ´, Berlin,
Germany), was performed on anaesthetized animals that were injected
with ketamine (10 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (25 mg/kg body
weight). Thereafter, mice were placed in a stereotactic device (Kopf
Instruments) and fixed accordingly. The skull was exposed and a hole
was drilled in the skull overlying the left hemisphere at 0.4 mm rostral
and 1.8 mm lateral to bregma. Mice received 5ml of either BSc2118
(30 mg/kg body weight) or dimethyl sulphoxide (control animals) at
3.5 mm ventral to bregma. Non-treated animals underwent the same
treatment paradigm, including insertion of the Hamilton syringe, but
received no injection of drug or solvent. To achieve knock-down of
hypoxia inducible factor 1  (HIF1A), injections for intracerebral delivery
of small interfering RNAs were performed on Day 3 before stroke
induction following the same protocol as for BSc2118 injection.
Animals received either Accell SMARTpool mouse HIF1A small interfering
RNA (4 mg/kg body weight; Dharmacon), which consists of a
mixture of four small interfering RNA constructs provided as a single
reagent, thereby ensuring high-transfection rates (www.dharmacon.
com), whereas control animals received Accell non-targeting small
interfering RNA (4 mg/kg body weight; Dharmacon). For each
animal, two injections (5ml volume each) of small interfering RNAs
were done at the same time point in the left hemisphere at 1.5 and
2.2 mm lateral from bregma. Ventral and rostral coordinates were
identical as stated previously for BSc2118 injection. Cerebral ischaemia
was induced 3 days after stereotactic injection of small interfering
RNAs.
For studies on rt-PA-induced brain toxicity, rt-PA (10 mg/kg body
weight, Boehringer Ingelheim) was injected into the right femoral vein
at the beginning of the reperfusion. Although 10% of rt-PA contents
was given as bolus injection, the remaining 90% was given within the
following 15 min. Control animals received saline.
Experiments using the HIF1A inhibitor YC1, which is equivalent to
3-(50-hydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (Enzo Life Sciences),
were performed at dosages of 10 mg/kg body weight (dissolved
in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide) per injection. Mice received continuous
daily intraperitoneal injections of 50ml beginning on Day 1 until the
end of the experiment. Dimethyl sulphoxide served as solvent control.
Detection of fluorescence labelled
BSc2118
Non-ischaemic animals were stereotactically injected with
fluorescence-labelled BSc2118, using the same coordinates as for

further experiments (see earlier in the text). At 24 h after injection, mice
were intraperitoneal injected with chloral hydrate (7% in 0.1 M phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), 420 mg/kg body weight) and transcardially
perfused with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS). Brains were removed,
shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cryosections were prepared.
Fluorescence was analysed using an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
BSc2118 inhibitor assays on isolated
20S proteasomes
The chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S proteasomes was estimated by
hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-
LLVY-AMC; Bachem) as described previously (Braun et al., 2005).
Briefly, proteasomes (100 ng) were preincubated with 0.01–1mM of 
BSc2118 in 20 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) (pH 7.2) for 10 min at room temperature. The measurement
of proteasome activity was initiated by addition of 50mM
Suc-LLVY-AMC in the same buffer and was incubated for 30 min at
37C. The released AMC is proportional to the proteasome activity
and is detected by fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at
360 nm) using a BioTek Synergy fluorimeter. Fluorescence release by
proteasomes without inhibitor preincubation was set as 100%. For
estimation of inhibition velocity of BSc2118, kinetics were performed
without 10 min of preincubation. Rather, substrate and BSc2118 (0–
500 nM) were initially incubated as described previously. The reaction
was started by adding 20S proteasomes (100 ng), followed by immediate
recording of AMC cleavage for as long as 30 min.
To analyse the stability and bioavailability of BSc2118, an 0.1 mM
BSc2118 solution in an aqueous solution, such as Tris (pH 7.4) containing
10% foetal calf serum was made and stored for up to 3 days
before use at 4C. From these stock solutions, the inhibitor concentrations
(0.05–1mM) for the proteasome assay (see earlier in the text)
were prepared. To analyse the interaction of the inhibitor with the
proteasome in terms of reversibility, 20S proteasomes were incubated
with BSc2118, and stability of interaction was tested by dilution and
dialysis assays. For dilution assays, 10mg of human 20S proteasomes
derived from erythrocytes were incubated with 1mM BSc2118 or with
0.1mM bortezomib (Velcade, Millenium) for 1 h at room temperature.
Thereafter, incubated proteasomes were diluted (1:2, 1:4, 1:8
and 1:16) and incubated again for 1 h. The remaining proteasome
activity was measured with calculated 100 ng proteasomes per assay
as described previously. For the dialysis assay, 10mg of 20S proteasomes
were incubated with 1mM of BSc2118 or 0.1mM of bortezomib
in 100ml for 1 h. The samples were diluted with 1 ml of 20 mM
Tris (pH 7.2) and were incubated for 30 min. The unbound inhibitor
was removed by centrifugation with Vivaspin 500 (3000 molecular
weight cut-off). The dilution/centrifugation step was repeated twice.
The volume of dialysed proteasomes were adjusted to 100ml, and the
proteasome activity was measured as described previously.
Assessment of BSc2118-induced
toxicity after systemic application
To rule out major toxic effects of the proteasome inhibitor, BSc2118
was given intraperitoneally at dosages of 30 or 60 mg/kg body weight
to non-ischaemic C57BL/6 mice. BSc2118 was given as single intraperitoneal
injections for seven consecutive days, i.e. Days 0–6. Animals
were allowed to recover from injections on Days 7–14. Dimethyl
sulphoxide (100%) was administered as control. Parameters analysed
included weight loss and peripheral blood analysis. On Days 0, 7 and
14, 50ml of blood was taken from the tail vein, which was then
haematologically analysed. Each peripheral blood analysis was done
within 2 h after blood sampling. Quantitative examinations were
made on a veterinary haematological analyser (BC-2800Vet,
Mindray) using an impedance method.
Fluorometric measurement of
proteasome activity in brain lysates
Proteasome activity was determined in brain homogenates of left
non-ischaemic hemispheres 24 h after intrastriatal injection using a
lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris–HCl, 145 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100 at pH 7.5, as described previously
(Doeppner et al., 2003). The substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (50mM;
Bachem) was used for detection of the chymotrypsin-like activity of
the proteasome. Briefly, 200ml of lysis buffer was incubated with 90ml
of a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM magnesium
acetate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM leupeptin, 1mg/ml aprotinin
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (Merck).
Substrate cleavage was determined at 37C in a fluorescence microtitre
plate reader with 
excitation
= 355 nm and 
emission
= 460 nm;
AMC (Sigma Aldrich) was used for initial calibration. Protease activities
are given as arbitrary units per min per mg of protein. The protein
content of each sample was determined using the Bradford assay.
Induction of transient focal cerebral
ischaemia
Stroke was induced using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion
model as described previously (Doeppner et al., 2010). Briefly,
mice were anaesthetized (1–1.5% isoflurane, 30% O
2
, remainder
N
2
O), and body temperature was maintained at 37C using a rectal
thermometer feedback-controlled heating system. Cerebral blood flow
was continuously assessed by recording laser Doppler flow to ensure
appropriate ischaemia and reperfusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
was induced using a 7-0 silicon rubber coated monofilament
(coating length 4–5 mm, tip diameter 180mm; Doccol), which was
withdrawn after 45 min of ischaemia to allow reperfusion of the
middle cerebral artery.
Analysis of post-ischaemic brain injury
and of tissue responses by
immunohistochemistry
Infarct volumes were analysed on Day 4, for which brains were
removed and cut into slices of 2 mm each. Slices were stained with
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, 2%), and a computer-based
analysis of infarct volumes was done using the software ImageJ (NIH)
by subtracting the area of the non-lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere from
that of the contralateral side. Infarct volume sizes were calculated by
integration of the lesioned areas. Post-ischaemic brain oedema was
measured as the increase of ipsilateral hemispheric volume in comparison
with the contralateral hemisphere as previously described (Wacker
et al., 2009).
For assessment of neuronal density, animals received intraperitoneal
injections of chloral hydrate (420 mg/kg body weight) and were transcardially
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde at Days 28 and 84.
Brains were removed, post-fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in
paraffin, and coronal sections (2mm) were prepared. Sections were
deparaffinized, boiled in 0.2% citrate buffer and incubated with blocking
solution. Neuronal density was determined using NeuN-staining,

for which sections were exposed to blocking solution and subsequently
stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (1:200, 18 h,
4C; Chemicon). After washing, sections were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with a secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor
488 antibody (1:400; Molecular Probes). Quantitative analyses were
performed defining four regions of interest within the ischaemic striatum
located 0.14 mm anterior, 2.5–3.75 mm ventral and 1.5–2.25 mm
lateral from bregma (see also Supplementary Fig. 1). For each region
of interest, three sections per animal were analysed in a blinded
manner.
For analysis of BSc2118-mediated effects on post-ischaemic cell proliferation
and angioneurogenesis, mice received daily intraperitoneal
injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg body weight;
Sigma) on Days 8–18. Brain sections (see earlier) were stained with a
rat monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:50; 18 h, 4C; Serotec) in
combination with a goat polyclonal anti-doublecortin antibody (1:50;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody
(see earlier in the text). For analysis of post-ischaemic vessel
density and angiogenesis, a rat anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)31
antibody (1:200, BD Biosciences) was used. The following secondary
antibodies were applied: goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:400;
Dianova) for BrdU and CD31 staining, donkey anti-goat Alexa
Fluor 488 (1:250; Molecular Probes) for doublecortin (Dcx) staining
and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (see earlier in the text) for
NeuN staining. Quantitative analysis implied the same regions of interest
as stated previously.
Analysis of post-stroke functional
deficits
Behavioural tests were performed on the same animals that were also
used for immunohistochemical analysis on Day 84. Experimenters
involved in behavioural tests were blinded to the treatment paradigm
of animals used. All mice were trained 1 day before stroke. Motor coordination
deficits were analysed using the rotarod test, tight rope and the
corner turn test on Days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84, as has been described by us
in detail (Doeppneret al., 2010, 2011b). Briefly, mice used for the rotarod
test were put on an accelerating treadmill (TSE Systems), and the time
spent on the rod (maximum 300 s) was determined. For the tight rope
test, animals were placed on a 60 cm long rope, which was attached to
two platforms, and were scored from 0 (minimum) to 20 (maximum)
depending on the time they spent on the rope and whether they reached
the platform. Both tests were performed twice at each time point, and
means were calculated. For the corner turn test, each mouse was tested
for the side chosen410 trials per test day, i.e. right or left rearing in the
corner. Although healthy animals leave the corner without side preference
, mice suffering from stroke preferentially turn to the left,
non-impaired body side (Zhang et al., 2002). The laterality index was
calculated according to the following formula: (number of left
turns number of right turns)/10.
Deficits in learning and memory were assessed by means of a modified
water maze test on Days 82–84 post-stroke (Doeppner et al.,
2010). Each experiment consisted of 24 trials, i.e. four trials in the
morning and four trials in the afternoon of each test day. For Trials
1–16 and 21–24, the transparent plexiglass platform was always
located in the centre of the same quadrant, and animals were
always put into the same of one of the remaining quadrants. For
assessment of new learning strategies (task switch), the platform
was set into another quadrant for Trials 17–20 in the morning of
Day 84. Thereafter, the platform was relocated at its original position
for the remaining four trials (21–24). The time (maximal 90 s per trial)
needed to reach the platform was statistically analysed using a
computer-based system (TSE Systems). Data are given as means of
four trials each.
Assessment of blood–brain barrier
permeability
Blood–brain barrier permeability was analysed using Evans Blue
extravasation as previously described by Chiba et al. (2008). Evans
Blue (2%, 2 ml/kg body weight) was injected 22 h post-stroke followed
by transcardiac perfusion with PBS 2 h later. Brains were
removed. Left hemispheres were weighed, homogenized in 2 ml of
50% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10 000g for 20 min. The
extracted Evans Blue dye was further diluted with ethanol and the
fluorescence signal was measured with a luminescence spectrophotometer
(
excitation
= 620 nm, 
emission
= 680 nm). An external standard
(62.5–500 ng/ml) was used for calculation of Evans Blue contents.
Matrix metalloprotease 9 zymography
Matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) zymography has been performed as
previously described (Doeppner et al., 2011a). Briefly, left hemispheres
were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (basic buffer) containing 50
mM/l Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM/l NaCl, 5 mM/l CaCl
2
, 0.05%
BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN
3
and 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation
and subsequent resuspension of pellets in elution buffer (basic
buffer containing 10% dimethyl sulphoxide and 20% volume of lysis
buffer). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic
acid method (BCA kit, Thermo Scientific).
Separation of MMP9 as pro-form and active form was done using
Novex Zymogram Gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were incubated in non-reducing sample buffer
(0.4 M/l Tris, pH 6.8, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 20% glycerol,
0.05% bromophenol blue) for 10 min at room temperature.
Thereafter, the samples were loaded onto 10% SDS–PAGE gels containing
0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, samples were incubated
with 2.5% Triton X-100 twice for 20 min, equilibrated with developing
buffer (Novex) and incubated for 418 h at 37C. Gels were
stained with Coomassie blue for 30 min and were destained in washing
solution (30% methanol, 10% acetic acid). As standards, 0.1 ng of
human pro-MMP9 and 0.01 ng of activated MMP9 (both from
Merck Biosciences) were used. Gels were scanned and densitometrically
analysed.
Measurement of haemoglobin content
Analysis of haemoglobin content followed a protocol described by
Su et al. (2008). Animals were sacrificed on Day 4 after stroke, followed
by transcardiac perfusion with PBS. Left hemispheres were
homogenized in 475ml PBS at 25 000g for 30s, with subsequent addition
of 25 ml of 10% Triton X-100. After thorough mixing, samples
were centrifuged at 25 000g for 30 min (4C). A volume of 50ml from
each supernatant was used for photometric analysis at an absorbance
of 410 nm, using purified haemoglobin (Sigma-Aldrich) as standard.
Western blotting for HIF1A
For analysis of HIF1A abundance 24 h post-stroke, left (ischaemic) hemispheres
of individual mice were complemented with lysis buffer (50 mM/l
Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM/l NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors),
homogenized and centrifuged. Lysates were centrifuged, and

supernatants were used for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Equal amounts of protein (40mg) were
diluted in 6 sample buffer, boiled and loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide
gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes,
which were immersed in blocking solution (5% milk in 0.1% Tween
20 + Tris-buffered saline; 1 h at room temperature) and incubated with
a rabbit anti-HIF1A antibody (1:1000; Abcam). Thereafter, membranes
were incubated with a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed several times,
immersed in enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution and exposed
to ECL-Hyperfilm (Amersham).
Determination of thiobarbituric acid
reactive substances
Oxidative stress was assessed 24 h after stroke in brain homogenates
(see ‘western blotting’ section). Formation of reactive oxygen species
leads to peroxidation of fatty acids of phospholipids contained within
the cell membrane. During peroxidation, formation of thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances is generated, such as malondialdehyde. The
latter reacts with thiobarbituric acid yielding a chromogenic compound
whose absorption can be photometrically measured at  = 532 nm as
described previously (Noll et al., 1987). The extent of thiobarbituric
acid reactive substance formation is expressed as malondialdehyde
equivalents, using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as standard.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
For ELISA, brain samples were collected as described previously on
Days 28 and 84. Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (R&D
Systems), nerve growth factor (Promega), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (Promega), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Promega),
basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems), erythropoietin (Abnova)
and epidermal growth factor (R&D Systems) were measured using
commercial mouse ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’
instructions.
Statistics
All data are given as mean standard deviation (SD). For comparison
between two groups, the Student t-test was used, whereas for
a multi-group comparison, a one-way or a multi-way ANOVA was
performed. For post hoc analysis, the Tukey’s test was used.
P-values of 50.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Characterization of the novel
proteasome inhibitor BSc2118
Before the in vivo experiments, the inhibitor profile of BSc2118
was analysed on isolated 20S proteasomes (Fig. 1A–D). Kinetics of
BSc2118-induced inhibition of 20S proteasome activities without
further preincubation of the inhibitor revealed immediate inhibition
of proteasome activity, which was functionally complete at a
BSc2118 concentration of 500 nM (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence intensity
in arbitrary units after 30 min of measurement was 137.5 10.4
(control), 92.8 5.0 (BSc2118, 50 nM), 54.5 13.9 (BSc2118,
100 nM) and 13.7 8.1 (BSc2118, 500 nM).
Inhibitor potency of BSc2118 (0.05–1mM) on isolated 20S proteasomes
was preserved at high concentrations (1mM) for as long
as 3 days despite storage in aqueous solution, which was chosen
to better mimic the (extra-) cellular compartment of the brain
(Fig. 1B). Relative proteasomal activity after treatment with
BSc2118 (1mM) was 18.9 1.3% (Day 0), 24.8 1.0% (Day 1),
31.3 2.0% (Day 2) and 27.9 9.7% (Day 3). The reduction
of inhibitory potency as seen for intermediate concentrations, i.e.
0.1–0.5mM, is most likely because of unspecific binding on proteins
within the buffer. Remarkably, a steady state was observed
on Days 2 and 3, where the inhibitory potency was no further
reduced, suggesting that BSc2118 is relatively stable under these
experimental conditions. Assessment of reversibility of BSc2118-
induced inhibition of the 20S proteasome was assessed using dilution
and dialysis assays (Fig. 1C and D). Proteasome activity after
repeated dilution of the proteasome-inhibitor complex did not significantly
enhance proteasome activity when proteasomes were
initially incubated with the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118
(Fig. 1C). Applying 1mM of BSc2118, we observed a proteasome
activity of 51.9 6.2% before dilution and an activity of
66.6 6.7% after 16 dilution compared with non-inhibited proteasomes.
Of note, proteasomal activity after treatment with the
reference inhibitor bortezomib significantly increased after
16 dilution (35.7 5.0 versus 84.6 23.0%). In another
experimental setting, proteasome activities with/without presence
of inhibitors were analysed after having removed the unbound
inhibitor from the proteasome-inhibitor interaction by means of
dialysis. Measurement of residual proteasome activities after dialysis
, however, did not significantly differ from values obtained
before dialysis (Fig. 1D), i.e. proteasome activity after BSc2118
treatment was 41.0 17.1% before dialysis and 53.0 13.9%
after dialysis. These data suggest that BSc2118 irreversibly binds
to 20S proteasomes, thus, inhibiting enzyme activities.
To ensure that BSc2118 is well tolerated in mice, toxicity studies
after systemic (intraperitoneal) injection of BSc2118 for seven consecutive
days were performed. Although BSc2118 at a dosage of
60 mg/kg body weight induced temporary weight loss closely
related with the treatment phase, animals completely recovered
at the end of the observation period (Fig. 1E). Minimal weight
observed for animals being treated with BSc2118 (60 mg/kg
body weight) was measured on Day 5, with a weight of
14.3 1.4 g compared with mice treated with 30 mg/kg body
weight of BSc2118 (16.4 1.1 g) or to control animals
(15.8 0.9 g). In line with this, treatment with BSc2118 (30 and
60 mg/kg body weight) did not affect haematological parameters,
albeit white blood cells were reduced solely on Day 14 in animals
treated with BSc2118 in a dosage of 30 mg/kg body weight
(Supplementary Table 1). However, no leukopaenia was observed
in these animals. Taken further into account that all animals
behaved normally during and after treatment with BSc2118, the
novel proteasome inhibitor is well tolerated, even when given
systemically.
To ensure sufficient bioavailability in the brain, a fluorescently
labelled BSc2118 construct was injected into the peritoneum and
the striatum. Intrastriatal injection of the proteasome inhibitor into
the non-ischaemic left striatum yielded a significant fluorescence
signal at 24 h (Fig. 1F–H), whereas intraperitoneal injection did not

result in detection of any intracerebral fluorescence signal (data
not shown). Likewise, proteasome activity in brain lysates was
significantly reduced in non-ischaemic animals that were treated
with BSc2118 at dosages of510 mg/kg body weight, albeit inhibition
of enzyme activity was more prominent with inhibitor dosages
of 30 and 60 mg/kg body weight (Fig. 1I). After 20 min of
continuous measurement, we observed an AMC release of
882.0 99.7 (control), 602.0 56.2 (10 mg/kg body weight
BSc2118), 156.0 25.6 (30 mg/kg body weight BSc2118) and
119.0 46.1 (60 mg/kg body weight BSc2118). On the contrary,
systemic injection of BSc2118 (30 and 60 mg/kg body weight) did
not affect cerebral proteasome activity (data not shown). In light

of lack of cerebral fluorescence signal and lack of inhibition of
cerebral proteasome activity after systemic application, these
data suggest that BSc2118 in its current form does not pass the
intact blood–brain barrier, prompting further experiments to be
undertaken through the intrastriatal delivery route.
BSc2118 is neuroprotective against
cerebral ischaemia
When given intrastriatally 12 h before induction of stroke,
BSc2118 yielded significant reduction of infarct volumes on Day
4 (Fig. 2A and B), starting at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight
(46.2 5.7 mm3) when compared with non-treated mice
(61.9 10.2 mm3). Although no further difference with respect
to brain injury between dosages of 30 mg (40.1 7.5 mm3) and
60 mg (37.6 9.5 mm3) was observed, a dosage of 100 mg/kg
body weight was lethal in all animals (data not shown). Of
note, injection of dimethyl sulphoxide solvent did not affect
brain injury when compared with non-treated animals
(71.4 6.1 versus 61.9 10.2 mm3), which had received no
intrastriatal injection. All animals receiving intrastriatal injections
of either BSc2118 or solvent showed no signs of clinical impairment
as had been stated for the systemic delivery route previously.
To reflect a clinically relevant situation, BSc2118
(30 mg/kg body weight) was given at different time points
before and after induction of stroke, resulting in significant neuroprotection
when given up to 12 h post-ischaemia (Fig. 2C). With
a 6 h post-stroke treatment paradigm, infarct volumes were
42.3 7.2 mm3 (BSc2118) and 73.9 4.8 mm3 (control), whereas
treatment after 12 h post-stroke yielded an infarct volume of
44.7 6.3 mm3 (BSc2118) and 80.5 11.3 mm3 (control). In
line with this, injection of BSc2118 (30 mg/kg body weight) at
12 h post-stroke induced long-term neuroprotection for as long
as 3 months (Fig. 2D). Neuronal density on Day 84 was
774.3 73.8 (BSc2118) and 489.1 57.2 (control) per mm2.
Reduced brain injury in animals treated with BSc2118 was

associated with significant reduction of motor coordination and
cognitive deficits (Fig. 3). Test performance on Day 84 of
BSc2118-treated mice in the rotarod test was 284.0 20.4 s, in
the tight rope test 17.3 1.7, in the corner turn test 0.57 0.06
and in the water maze test (runs XXI–XXIV) 29.5 4.5 s, whereas
control animals achieved test results of 219.0 22.9 s (rotarod),
13.2 1.5 (tight rope), 0.75 0.09 (corner turn) and 53.8 2.9 s
(water maze). These data suggest that single injections of the
novel proteasome inhibitor are sufficient to induce long-term neuroprotection
and improve functional outcome after stroke.
BSc2118 stabilizes blood–brain barrier
and reduces activation of MMP9
Cerebral ischaemia involves multiple deleterious events, among
which blood–brain barrier breakdown is one key factor. As such,
we first analysed whether BSc2118 when given 12 h post-stroke
reduces brain swelling. Analysis of oedema formation on Day
4 post-stroke revealed reduced brain swelling in mice that had
been treated with the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4A;
3.3 0.6%) compared with dimethyl sulphoxide control animals
(6.2 0.8%). Likewise, the same treatment paradigm resulted in
reduced extravasation of Evans Blue 24 h post-stroke (Fig. 4B),
i.e. Evans Blue extravasation was 5.6 0.8mg/g in
BSc2118-treated animals versus 9.7 1.6mg/g in control mice.
As activated MMP9 is critically involved in post-ischaemic blood–
brain barrier breakdown (Candelario-Jalil et al., 2009), MMP9
activity was assessed 24 h after induction of stroke using gelatin
zymography (Fig. 4C and D). Although non-ischaemic control animals
showed no relevant MMP9 activation (0.30 0.05), the
latter was critically enhanced in animals that were exposed to
cerebral ischaemia (14.2 1.6 in non-treated and 12.8 1.4 in
dimethyl sulphoxide-treated control animals). Treatment with
BSc2118, however, significantly reduced activation of MMP9 in
animals that had been exposed to cerebral ischaemia
(4.9 0.6), suggesting that BSc2118 stabilizes blood–brain barrier
integrity—among others—through reduced MMP9 activation.
HIF1A is critically involved in
BSc2118-mediated neuroprotection
The transcription factor HIF1A is regulated through proteasomal
degradation, playing a decisive role in cerebral ischaemia (Shi,
2009). As such, we analysed HIF1A protein abundance
24 h after stroke in mice that had received intravenous injection of
rt-PA or normal saline as control (Fig. 5A and B). Although HIF1A
Figure 3 BSc2118 ameliorates post-ischaemic functional neurological deficits. Assessment of motor coordination, learning and memory
was assessed in ischaemic mice using the rotarod (A), tight rope (B), corner turn (C) and water maze (D) tests. The water maze test was
performed on Days 82–84 with four runs in the morning and four runs in the afternoon of each test day. Runs in the morning of Day 84
(XXVII–XX) included a change of platform position (‘task switch’) with subsequent repositioning of the platform for runs XXI–XXIV during
the afternoon of Day 84. Control animals received intrastriatal injections of dimethyl sulphoxide. BSc2118 was intrastriatally injected at a
dose of 30 mg/kg body weight at 12 h post-stroke. Data are means (SD) (n=11 mice per group). *Significantly different from dimethyl
sulphoxide treated control animals, P5 0.05.

expression was hardly detectable in non-ischaemic mice
(0.04 0.03), cerebral ischaemia induced upregulation of HIF1A
in rt-PA-treated (0.39 0.11) and saline-treated (0.36 0.09)
animals. Additional application of BSc2118 at 12 h post-stroke,
however, resulted in significantly increased HIF1A levels in
saline-treated (0.75 0.07) and rt-PA-treated mice
(0.79 0.05). Consequently, enhanced protein abundance of
HIF1A in BSc2118-treated animals also resulted in reduced thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances formation at 24 h post-stroke
(Fig. 5C), i.e. the proteasome inhibitor reduced formation of reactive
oxygen species in mice treated with saline (0.92 0.13
nM/mg) or rt-PA (0.84 0.09 nM/mg) compared with control
mice (1.36 0.15 and 1.48 0.18 nM/mg). As proteasome inhibition
is an unspecific tool, which can result in modulation of
different cell cascades, we analysed whether BSc2118-induced effects
on HIF1A expression and brain injury can be reversed by
inhibition of HIF1A itself. Using the HIF1A inhibitor YC1 in combination
with BSc2118 (Fig. 5D), infarct volumes significantly
increased on Day 4 in animals that had been treated with either
saline (62.5 7.3 mm3) or rt-PA (59.1 8.1 mm3) compared with
control animals (38.6 5.8 mm3 for saline-treated and
37.1 4.7 mm3 for rt-PA-treated mice). To further strengthen
our hypothesis that HIF1A is a critical mediator of
BSc2118-induced neuroprotection, a small interfering RNA construct
was intrastriatally given 3 days before induction of stroke,
resulting in a knock-down of HIF1A in these animals (Fig. 5E). Inline
with the aforementioned inhibition of HIF1A through YC1,
knock-down of HIF1A was associated with a lack of neuroprotection
despite application of BSc2118 (Fig. 5F), as shown by infarct
volumes of 51.9 4.9 and 55.3 3.1 mm3 for saline-treated and
rt-PA-treated animals, respectively.
BSc2118 reduces recombinant
tissue-plasminogen activator-induced
post-ischaemic toxicity
Although rt-PA induces excitotoxic cell injury and enhances
secondary haemorrhage, it remains the gold standard for causative
therapy of ischaemic stroke. Therefore, we analysed
BSc2118-mediated effects on infarct size, Evans Blue extravasation
, MMP9 activation and haemorrhage formation after rt-PA
treatment. Intravenous delivery of rt-PA at the beginning of reperfusion
resulted in aggravation of brain injury on Day 4 post-stroke
(86.9 9.3 mm3 in non-treated mice and 89.1 8.5 mm3 in
dimethyl sulphoxide control mice), which was prevented by
BSc2118 (41.7 5.8 mm3; Fig. 6A). Such rt-PA-induced aggravation
of injury was not observed after BSc2118 treatment
(34.2 6.2 versus 41.7 5.8 mm3). Notably, infarct volumes of
animals that had received intravenous saline injection and subsequent
intracerebral treatment with or without dimethyl sulphoxide
(66.2 7.2 and 61.9 11.5 mm3; Fig. 6A) were similar to animals
that had received intravenous injection of saline and a combined
treatment with BSc2118 and YC1 (Fig. 5D), suggesting that
YC1 completely reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection in
saline-treated mice. Although BSc2118-induced neuroprotection

after rt-PA injection was also reversed after combined treatment
with BSc2118 and YC1 (Fig. 5D), the extent of brain injury in
these animals was still significantly (P50.05) lower than in animals
treated with rt-PA with (89.1 8.5 mm3) or without
(86.9 9.3 mm3) dimethyl sulphoxide (Fig. 6A). In other words,
BSc2118-induced reduction of rt-PA-induced aggravation of brain
injury does not completely depend on HIF1A.
In line with this, analysis of blood–brain barrier integrity revealed
that increased extravasation of Evans Blue after rt-PA treatment
(12.6 0.7 and 13.8 0.9mg/g, respectively, for non-treated and
dimethyl sulphoxide treated mice) was significantly reduced when
BSc2118 was injected into the ischaemic brain (5.7 0.8mg/g;
Fig. 6B). Enhanced post-ischaemic MMP9 activity, which was
highly increased in animals that had received rt-PA (23.6 3.5 and
24.7 1.7), was also significantly reduced after treatment with
BSc2118 (10.6 3.3; Fig. 6C). Analysis of haemoglobin content
(Fig. 6D) revealed enhanced secondary haemorrhage in animals
that had been treated with rt-PA (59.2 4.1 and 65.1 7.1mg,
respectively, for non-treated and dimethyl sulphoxide treated
mice). Combined treatment with rt-PA and BSc2118, however, significantly
reduced haemoglobin content in these animals
(43.8 6.1mg), when compared with control animals. These data
suggest that application of the proteasome inhibitor BSc2118
reduces rt-PA-induced post-ischaemic toxicity.

Application of BSc2118 is associated
with enhanced post-ischaemic
angioneurogenesis
As single treatment with BSc2118 resulted in long-term neuroprotection
(Fig. 2D), we wondered whether the latter was a consequence
of profound acute neuroprotecton (Fig. 2A–C) or implied
other mechanisms as well. As BSc2118 affected HIF1A protein abundance
(Fig. 5A and B), which modulates differentiation of neural
precursor cells and angiogenesis (Shi, 2009; Mazumdar et al.,
2010; Tsai et al., 2011; Cunningham et al., 2012), we analysed
post-ischaemic angioneurogenesis and growth factor contents for
as long as 3 months after induction of stroke. Assessment
of post-ischaemic cell proliferation revealed an increased number
of BrdU+ proliferating cells within the subventricular zone
(e.g. 89.1 10.3 versus 49.8 11.3 cells per mm2 on Day 84) and
within the ischaemic striatum (e.g. 581.3 72.8 versus
297.2 57.2 cells per mm2 on Day 84) of mice that had been treated
with the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 7A–F). Likewise, we found a
significantly enhanced number of proliferating cells expressing the
immature neuronal marker Dcx in the subventricular zone and
the striatum of animals treated with BSc2118 (Fig. 7G–K). Within
the subventricular zone of BSc2118-treated animals, we found
4.9 0.4% (Day 28) and 5.6 1.1% (Day 84) Dcx +/BrdU + cells,
whereas cell numbers in control animals were 1.3 0.2% (Day 28)
and 1.8 0.5% (Day 84). As for the striatum, numbers of Dcx +/
BrdU + cells in BSc2118-treated animals were 17.2 2.8% (Day 28)
and 24.8 3.2% (Day 84) compared with 9.2 1.9% (Day 28) and
13.1 2.4% (Day 84) in control animals (Fig. 7G). Analysis of
co-expression patterns of proliferating cells with the mature neuronal
marker NeuN revealed enhanced numbers of NeuN +/BrdU + cells
located in the ischaemic striatum of mice treated with BSc2118
(e.g. 4.9 0.8 versus 1.7 0.5% cells per mm2 in control animals
on Day 84), albeit numbers of NeuN+/BrdU + cells were low
(Fig. 7G, L and M). However, no co-expression between BrdU and
NeuN within the subventricular zone of any experimental group was
observed (data not shown).
Treatment with BSc2118 also affected vessel density as indirectly
assessed using quantification of endothelial cells expressing
the marker CD31 within the ischaemic striatum (Fig. 8A and B).
We found an increased number of CD31 + cells in animals treated
with BSc2118, on Day 28 (43.1 6.4 versus 21.8 4.8 cells
per mm2) and on Day 84 (49.2 8.1 versus 25.9 5.6 cells
per mm2). Analysis of post-ischaemic angiogenesis using BrdU/

treated with the proteasome inhibitor (e.g. 14.2 3.7 versus
6.4 2.2% in control animals on Day 84).
Taken into account that enhanced angioneurogenesis can
orchestrate sustained changes within the ischaemic milieu through
bystander effects (Hermann and Chopp, 2012), we analysed the
contents of selected growth factors (Fig. 8D). We found elevated
contents of erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor in mice treated with the novel
proteasome inhibitor (e.g. 641.7 73.1, 341.2 38.9 and
149.3 20.6 pg/ml on Day 84) compared with control mice
(e.g. 192.8 47.9, 189.1 31.4 and 64.6 12.7 pg/ml on Day
84). These data suggest that therapeutic application of BSc2118
does not only yield acute neuroprotection but also induces
enhanced stimulation of angioneurogenesis, which might be critically
involved in the sustained neuroprotection noticed.
Discussion
The present study shows that a single intrastriatal injection of the
novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 induces long-term neuroprotection
after cerebral ischaemia in mice, which is associated with
reduced functional neurological deficits, decreased blood–brain
barrier breakdown and enhanced angioneurogenesis. Along with
this, protein abundance of HIF1A is significantly increased by
BSc2118, making proteasome inhibition a promising strategy for
stroke therapy.
Proteasome inhibitors have successfully been used before to
induce post-ischaemic neuroprotection when given no later than
4–6 h post-stroke as described previously. The herein presented
novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 further prolongs the aforementioned
time window for successful neuroprotective therapy
towards 12 h post-stroke. In this context, BSc2118 application
was not associated with evident signs of toxicity when given
systemically or intrastriatally in mice, which is a limiting factor
for therapies using proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib
(Richardson et al., 2003). Although observation periods from the
aforementioned studies were limited to a maximum of 7 days, our
study shows for the first time that single injections of a proteasome
inhibitor are sufficient to induce sustained neuroprotection
for up to 3 months, which go along with functional neurological
improvements, as evidenced by motor coordination, spatial learning
and memory capabilities. The need for single injections only is
a consequence of high BSc2118 stability in aqueous solution and

irreversible binding of BSc2118 to the 20S proteasome, inducing
long-term effects in the brain tissue. As the latter is likely a result
of BSc2118s actions on acute cell injury and post-ischaemic tissue
reorganization (see also later in the text), successful single injections
of BSc2118 should not be given later than 12 h post-stroke,
albeit 20S proteasome activity is immediately inhibited by
BSc2118. Clinical relevance for future translational approaches,
however, is temporarily hampered, as BSc2118 in its current
chemical form does not pass the intact blood–brain barrier after
systemic application. Although the therapeutic range of BSc2118 is
likely to be superior to bortezomib, as suggested by us through
in vitro experiments (Sterz et al., 2010) and the herein presented in vivo data, dosages of 100 mg/kg of BSc2118 were
lethal in vivo (unpublished observations). This observation indicates
that proteasome inhibition has a two-sided activity, which
is in line with Ge et al. (2007) who described proteasome malfunction
after cerebral ischaemia resulting in agglomeration of
misfolded proteins and ultimately cell death.
As proteasome inhibitors, such as MLN519 and bortezomib,
successfully reduce inflammation after haemorrhagic and ischaemic
stroke by helping to maintain blood–brain barrier integrity
(Berti et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006;
Sinn et al., 2007); blood–brain barrier permeability was assessed
after BSc2118 treatment. Animals treated with the proteasome
inhibitor showed significantly enhanced blood–brain barrier stability
and decreased MMP9 activation, which is critically involved in
post-ischaemic blood–brain barrier disruption (Candelario-Jalil
et al., 2009). Yet, the actions of BSc2118 were not restricted to
the preservation of the neurovascular unit, but also involved effects
on the brain parenchyma itself. Among important key mediators
of cerebral ischaemia, HIF1A—an important regulator of
hypoxia being regulated by proteasomal degradation—has
gained increasing interest (Shi, 2009). Induction of cerebral ischaemia
leads to up regulation of HIF1A in animals treated with rt-PA
and saline, whereas HIF1A protein abundance was just above
detection threshold in non-ischaemic mice, as was expected.
Treatment with BSc2118, however, significantly increased HIF1A
levels in rt-PA-treated and saline-treated animals, suggesting that
BSc2118 successfully inhibited secondary degradation of the transcription
factor. Indeed, inhibition of the latter by means of the
HIF1A inhibitor YC1 reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection.
Similarly, knock-down of HIF1A by means of small interfering
RNA constructs successfully reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection
, further supporting the hypothesis that effects of BSc2118
is indeed causatively mediated by HIF1A, perhaps rather than by
HIF1A independent pathways, such as mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibition, which has been described before (Sun
et al., 2007). Although the role of HIF1A in cerebral ischaemia
remains complex (Chavez and LaManna, 2002; Shi, 2009; Yan
et al., 2011), the role of HIF1A as mediator of BSc2118-induced
neuroprotection is intriguing based on the data presented here.
Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA does not only induce beneficial
effects through recanalization of the occluded vessel, but also
yields aggravation of brain injury because of intrinsic properties
of rt-PA itself (Kilic et al., 2001, 2005a, b; Crome et al., 2007;
Copin et al., 2011), albeit the underlying mechanisms have not
been fully elucidated, yet. On the other hand, application of
BSc2118 reduces rt-PA-mediated aggravation of brain injury,
such as secondary intracerebral haemorrhage. Notably, brain
injury in rt-PA-treated mice was still significantly smaller after
inhibition of HIF1A by means of YC1 compared with animals
that had received rt-PA only. In other words, BSc2118-induced
inhibition of rt-PA-mediated aggravation of brain injury is likely
to be not solely dependent on HIF1A. In this context, Chopp
and colleagues also observed an extended thrombolytic time
window (up to 6 h after stroke onset) when rt-PA was applied
with proteasome inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2001, 2006, 2010).
The authors inferred that proteasome inhibition potentiated
rt-PAs beneficial effects on cerebral perfusion, thus, explaining
the enhanced outcome in their cerebral thromboembolism model.
As HIF1A stimulates angiogenesis and differentiation of neural
precursor cells (Shi, 2009; Mazumdar et al., 2010; Tsai et al.,
2011; Cunningham et al., 2012), we analysed post-ischaemic
angioneurogenesis after BSc2118-treatment. Stroke itself yielded
stimulated angiogenesis and neurogenesis, with the latter being
tightly linked to the former as has been described previously
(Arvidsson et al., 2002; Greenberg and Jin, 2005; Hess and
Borlongan, 2008; Xiong et al., 2010). On the other hand, treatment
with BSc2118 further increased angioneurogenesis.
As endogenous neural precursor cells rather act through indirect
bystander effects than by neural cell replacement of lost tissue
(Hess and Borlongan, 2008), contents of selected growth factors
within the ischaemic hemisphere were determined, showing
increased levels of erythropoietin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor
and vascular endothelial growth factor after treatment with
BSc2118. Sustained post-ischaemic neuroprotection because of
proteasome inhibition is, therefore, most likely a multimodal
result of acute neuroprotection and enhanced brain remodelling,
with the latter being most likely a consequence of HIF1A stimulated
angiogenesis and neuronal differentiation, which has recently
been described through Notch and Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathways
(Cunningham et al., 2012). On the other hand, BSc2118
itself might also act directly on endogenous neural precursor
cells and endothelial precursor cells, providing enhanced survival
of neural precursor cells and endothelial precursor cells to guarantee
sufficient secretion of protecting factors into the cellular microenvironment.
Based on these multiple actions, proteasome
inhibition is a promising strategy for stroke treatment. Future
studies should focus on chemical formulations of proteasome
inhibitors suitable for systemic application.
