Reactive astrocyte proliferation is involved in many central degenerative diseases. The enzyme 6-
phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), an allosteric activator of 6-
phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), controls glycolytic flux. Furthermore, APC/C-Cdh1 plays a crucial role
in brain metabolism by regulating PFKFB3 expression. Previous studies have defined the roles of PFKFB3-
mediated glycolysis in pathological angiogenesis, cell autophagy, and amyloid plaque deposition in
proliferating cells. However, the role of PFKFB3 in reactive astrocyte proliferation after cerebral ischemia
is unknown. In this study, we cultured rat primary cortical astrocytes and established an oxygen-glucose
deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model to mimic cerebral ischemia in vivo. Astrocyte proliferation was
measured by western blotting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and by EdU incorporation. We
found that OGD/R up-regulated PFKFB3 and PFK1 expression, which was accompanied by reactive
astrocyte proliferation. Knockdown of PFKFB3 by siRNA transfection significantly inhibited reactive
astrocyte proliferation and lactate release, an indicator of glycolysis. We found that PFKFB3 and PFK1
expression were down-regulated and lactate release was decreased when OGD/R-induced astrocyte
proliferation was inhibited by a Cdh1-expressing lentivirus. Thus, reactive astrocyte proliferation can be
effectively suppressed by down-regulation of PFKFB3 through control of glycolytic flux, which is
downstream of APC/C-Cdh1.

1. Introduction
Reactive astrocyte proliferation has been identified in most or
all types of neurological insult, including intracerebral hemorrhage
, ischemic stroke, and various neurodegenerative diseases
(Colangelo et al., 2014; Nedergaard and Dirnagl, 2005; Pekny et al.,
2014). Between 1 and 3 h after cerebral ischemia, reactive astrocytes
release neurotrophic factors and antioxidants to protect
neurons against the damaging effects of free radicals. However, at
later stages, glial scars, formed from reactive astrocyte proliferation
and subsequent accumulation, act as an astrocytic barrier that
physically impedes axon regeneration and growth. Thus, early and
effective regulation of excessive astrocyte proliferation may
inhibit glial scar formation to create a favorable environment for
neuronal regeneration and thereby improve recovery from
ischemic injury.
The enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosph
atase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), which is an isoform of 6-
phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2), controls glycolytic flux by determining
the intracellular concentration of fructose-2,6-
bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase
(PFK1). As a key controller of glycolysis, PFKFB3 is involved in
many diseases including cancer (Yamamoto et al., 2014), neurodegeneration
(Fu et al., 2015; RodriguezeRodriguez et al., 2012),
and rheumatoid arthritis (Yang et al., 2014). Previous studies have

defined several roles for PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis in pathological
angiogenesis (Schoors et al., 2014), cell autophagy (Yang et al.,
2014), and amyloid plaque deposition (Fu et al., 2015) in proliferating
cells. Furthermore, PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis is linked to
cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in transformed cells. In
proliferating cells, silencing of PFKFB3 (through siRNA transfection
or the small molecule antagonist, 3PO) markedly attenuated
glycolytic activity, lactate production, and the rate of proliferation
(Calvo et al., 2006; Telang et al., 2012). Astrocytes are the most
abundant cell type in the mammalian brain and are also characterized
as proliferating cells. Disruption of energy metabolism in
the brain is a hallmark of cerebral ischemia. On the basis of these
studies, we hypothesized that PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis may
serve an important function in the regulation of reactive astrocyte
proliferation after cerebral ischemia.
Eukaryotic cell proliferation depends strictly on the E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C).
APC/C controls cell cycle transition through ubiquitination and
degradation of multiple cyclins (Peters, 2006). Cdh1 is an important
co-activator of APC/C during late mitosis and G1. Studies have
defined several roles for APC/C-Cdh1 in the regulation of neuronal
survival (Almeida, 2012; Almeida et al., 2005), neuronal differentiation
(Harmey et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010), axon growth (Kannan
et al., 2012; Konishi et al., 2004), synaptic development (van
Roessel et al., 2004) and brain metabolism (Herrero-Mendez
et al., 2009). APC/C-Cdh1 substrates are targeted for degradation
through specific recognition motifs, including the KEN box (Pfleger
and Kirschner, 2000). PFKFB3 contains a KEN box motif that targets
it to APC/C-Cdh1-mediated degradation (Herrero-Mendez et al.,
2009). In both neurons and astrocytes, it has been demonstrated
that APC/C-Cdh1 targets PFKFB3 for proteasomal degradation
(Herrero-Mendez et al., 2009).
As noted above, cerebral ischemia can lead to astrocyte activation
and glial scar formation. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and
reperfusion (OGD/R) is an in vitro model that mimics in vivo
astrogliosis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Huang et al.,
2008). A previous study in our laboratory demonstrated that APC/
C-Cdh1 activity was down-regulated in rat astrocytes after OGD/R
(Qiu et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized that, upon OGD/R,
PFKFB3 might be degraded by activation of APC/C-Cdh1 leading to
down regulation of glycolysis, thus reducing the amount of available
energy and substrates for subsequent ischemic astrocyte
proliferation. In this study, the expression of PFKFB3 and PFK1 (key
glycolysis enzymes), and the concentration of lactate in the culture
medium, which is a metabolite of glucose metabolism through the
glycolysis pathway, were used as indicators of glycolysis. Firstly, we
established an OGD/R model to investigate whether PFKFB3 upregulation
and the activation of glycolysis were accompanied by
reactive astrocyte proliferation. Secondly, astrocytes were transfected
with PFKFB3 siRNA (siPFKFB3) and examined under OGD/R
conditions to investigate the effects of PFKFB3 down-regulation on
astrocyte proliferation. Thirdly, a Cdh1-expressing lentivirus was
used to investigate the effects of Cdh1 overexpression on PFKFB3
protein expression and the activation of glycolysis in astrocytes
after OGD/R.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Primary astrocyte culture
All animal procedures followed NIH guidelines and were
approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). Primary
astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of
newborn (1e2days) SpragueeDawley rats as previously described
(McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980; Qiu et al., 2013). Briefly, the cerebral
cortex was digested with 0.125% trypsin for 15 min at 37C, and the
cells were plated in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and100 mg/mL streptomycin in culture flasks that had previously
been coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL; Sigma). These cells
were grown in a humidified incubator (37 C; 5% CO2), with the
medium replaced every 3 days. When cells reached confluence, in
approximately 7e9 days in vitro, the mixed cultures were shaken
overnight at 37 C to minimize microglia and oligodendroglia
contamination. The remaining astrocytes were trypsinized and
seeded at a density of 3  104 cells/cm2. More than 95% of the
cultured cells were astrocytes as identified by immunofluorescent
staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). All cell culture
experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative
pictures were shown for each experiment.
2.2. OGD/R application
OGD/R was performed as an in vitro model of hypoxicischemic
insult. Briefly, primary astrocytes were washed twice
and placed in an anaerobic chamber. The culture medium was
replaced with glucose-free DMEM (Gibco, USA) perfused with an
anaerobic gas mixture (95% N2,5%CO 2)at37Cfor3htoproduce
OGD. OGD was terminated by replacing the exposure medium
with standard medium and then returning the cells to the
incubator under normoxic conditions (37 C, 5% CO2) for 24 h. 
Control cells were treated identically except that they were not
exposed to OGD.
2.3. siRNA transfection
Astrocytes were transfected with a control non-targeting siRNA
or specific PFKFB3 siRNAs using a transfection kit (RiboBio,
Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, siRNAs (50 nM) were dissolved in the supplied buffer and
incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reagents were then
added to the siRNA-buffer solution for 10 min at room temperature.
Finally, the siRNA-reagent complexes were added to the culture
medium and cells were incubated for 3 days in a humidified
incubator (37 C, 5% CO2) before treatment.
2.4. Cdh1-expressing lentivirus treatment
The Cdh1-expressing lentivirus vector was constructed previously
(Qiu et al., 2012). As the lentivirus expresses greenfluorescent
protein (GFP), the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) and
infection duration was determined according to the level expression
of GFP under fluorescence microscopy. Astrocytes were
transfected with either a control lentivirus or the Cdh1-expressing
lentivirus for 10 h at an MOI of 20.The medium was then replaced
with standard culture medium. At 72 h after lentivirus treatment,
cells were subjected to OGD/R.
2.5. Cell extract preparation and western blotting
Proteins were extracted from primary astrocytes by lysis in RIPA
buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Sample protein concentrations
were determined with a BCA Protein Analysis kit (Biyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, China). Equal amounts of extracts
(30 mg) were separated by electrophoresis in 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF
membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated overnight
at 4 C with the following primary antibodies: Cdh1(ab154539,
1:500, Abcam, UK), PFK1(ab154804, 1:1000, Abcam, UK),

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
PFKFB3(A5262,1:500, ABclonal, USA), PCNA(ab2426,1:200, Abcam,
UK), or b-actin (1:500, Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China
).Membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, Boster
Biological Technology, Wuhan, China) for 1 h at room temperature.
Blots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents
(Thermo Scientific, USA). Signals were imaged with a
Chemi-Doc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad). The relative expression
levels of Cdh1, PFK1, PFKFB3, and PCNA were normalized to that of
the housekeeping gene b-actin.
2.6. Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from astrocytes with Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed
with the following PCR primers: b-actin, forward, 50-TGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGA-30 and reverse, 50-TAGAGCCACCAATC
CACACA-30; PFKFB3, forward, 50-CCTCTGCTTTTGAAACAGGC-30 and
reverse, 50-ATCCAGACAGACACTGCACG-30.A SYBR PrimeScript RTPCR
Kit (Takara) and PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (Takara) were
employed to detect levels of gene expression. All samples were read
in triplicate, and values were normalized to b-actin expression.
2.7. EdU incorporation assay
For EdU incorporation experiments, astrocytes were subcultured
on 12-well plates. After OGD/R, EdU (RiboBio, Guangzhou
, China) was added at a final concentration of 10 mMfor24h.
Cells were then washed with PBS, followed by fixation with PBS
containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilization with
PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After extensive
washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min with Apollo®
567 staining reaction buffer. After washed three times with PBS,
cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. All procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images of
the cells were captured by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon,
Japan).
2.8. Lactate release assay
Lactate is the end product of glycolysis. The glycolytic capacity
of the cells was assessed by determining the lactate concentration
in the culture medium (Almeida et al., 2010). The medium was
collected at 24 h reperfusion after OGD for assaying the release of
lactate. Lactate concentrations in the culture medium were
measured with a lactate assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.
Briefly, 0.02 mL aliquots of the culture medium, 0.02 mL aliquots of
3 mmol/L of lactate standard, or 0.02 mL aliquots of distilled water
were mixed in a 15 mL centrifuge tube with 1 mL of enzyme mix
and 0.2 mL of chromogeninc reagent, and incubated at 37 C
water-bath for 10 min, then added 2 mL of terminal reagent. Optical
density was measured at 530 nm with a spectrophotometer
and sample absorbance was calculated by subtracting the background
absorbance of the distilled water control from the total
absorbance.
2.9. Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Student's t-test, oneway
ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparison test were used as
appropriate for comparisons between different groups. A p
value< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. PFKFB3 up-regulation after OGD/R is accompanied by astrocyte
proliferation
Immunocytochemistry showed that PFKFB3 and PFK1 were
present in nucleus of astrocytes in the control group (Fig. 1A, B).
After OGD/R, PFKFB3 and PFK1 protein expression increased
significantly. We also examined the expression of PFKFB3 and PFK1
by western blotting, which indicated that OGD/R significantly
increased the expression of PFKFB3 and PFK1 (Fig. 1C). The
expression of PCNA, an important factor required for DNA synthesis
, can be used an index of cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1D,
western blot analyses of primary astrocyte cultures revealed
increased PCNA expression after OGD/R. Up-regulation of PCNA
expression demonstrates that the in vitro OGD/R successfully activated
astrocytes and induced their proliferation. Thus, PFKFB3 and
PFK1 expression positively correlated with reactive proliferation.
3.2. PFKFB3 siRNA inhibits reactive astrocyte proliferation after
OGD/R
We next investigated the role of PFKFB3 on reactive gliosis
through siRNA knockdown experiments. Real-time PCR analysis
showed that PFKFB3 siRNAs potently reduced PFKFB3 mRNA
expression in astrocytes under normal conditions (Fig. 2A) and
reduced the increase in PFKFB3 mRNA after OGD/R (Fig. 2B).We
then examined the effects of PFKFB3 silencing on cell proliferation
after OGD/R by using an EdU incorporation assay (Fig. 2C). As expected
, OGD/R increased cell proliferation; however, PFKFB3 siRNA
transfection markedly suppressed OGD/R-induced cell proliferation
(Fig. 2C, D). Moreover, western blot analysis showed that PFKFB3
siRNA transfection also decreased OGD/R-induced PCNA protein
expression (Fig. 2E).
3.3. PFKFB3 siRNA decreases PFKFB3 expression and lactate release
after OGD/R
As PFKFB3 is the most potent allosteric activator of the key
glycolytic enzyme PFK1, we expected that selective PFKFB3 inhibition
in astrocytes would reduce PFK1 protein activity, which, in
turn, would suppress the glycolytic capacity of astrocytes after
OGD/R. Western blot analyses were used to measure the protein
expression of PFKFB3. The results showed that siPFKFB3 transfection
decreased PFKFB3 protein expression in astrocytes under
both normal conditions (Fig. 3A, C) and OGD/R conditions (Fig. 3 B,
D). We next assessed the concentration of lactate, the end product
of glycolysis, in culture media to determine the glycolytic capacity
of the cells. Notably, OGD/R increased the concentration of lactate
in the medium, while transfection with siPFKFB3 significantly
decreased the OGD/R-induced increase in lactate levels (Fig. 3E).
These data demonstrate that PFKFB3 up-regulation is required to
maintain glycolyticflux in astrocytes.
3.4. PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis is involved in the inhibition of
reactive astrocyte proliferation via over-expression of Cdh1
Primary astrocytes were infected with a previously validated
Cdh1-expressing lentivirus (Qiu et al., 2013). At 72 h after lentiviral
infection, cells were treated with OGD/R. Proteins were then
extracted for western blotting. As demonstrated in Fig. 4AeF, lentiviral
infection increased Cdh1 protein expression in OGD/R-
treated cells. Furthermore, up-regulation of Cdh1 reduced the
OGD/R-induced increase inPFKFB3 and PFK1 protein expression.
Treatment with the Cdh1-expressing lentivirus also significantly

(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.214868238)
decreased lactate concentrations after OGD/R (Fig. 4G). We also
confirmed that Cdh1 overexpression suppressed OGD/R-induced
reactive proliferation of astrocytes by performing an EdU incorporation
assay (Fig. 4H, I).
4. Discussion
We cultivated primary rat astrocytes under OGD (95% N2,5%CO 2
and glucose withdrawal) for 3 h and reperfusion for 24 h, then
successfully induced astrocyte proliferation, mimicking reactive
astrocyte proliferation after hypoxic-ischemic injury, as demonstrated
previously (Schmid-Brunclik et al., 2008). The increase in
astrocyte proliferation after OGD/R was confirmed by EdU incorporation
, which indicates DNA replication, and by increased PCNA
protein expression. Our results demonstrated that OGD/R-induced
astrocyte proliferation was accompanied by increased PFKFB3
mRNA and protein expression as well as glycolytic activation.
Notably, PFKFB3 siRNA reduced both PFKFB3 mRNA and protein
expression after OGD/R, while down-regulation of PFKFB3
decreased lactate release in astrocytes after OGD/R, which, in turn,
suppressed astrocyte proliferation. Furthermore, infection with a
Cdh1-expressing lentivirus effectively increased the expression of
Cdh1 and decreased the expression of PFKFB3 after OGD/R in primary
astrocytes, which resulted in decreased PFK1 protein
expression and lactate release.
Cell proliferation is accompanied by the activation of glycolysis
in both cancer cells and proliferating non-neoplastic cells (Hume
et al., 1978; Vander Heiden et al., 2011). The purpose and

mechanism of this ‘‘aerobic glycolysis’’,first identified in cancer and
known as the Warburg effect (Warburg, 1956), remains unclear,
although it may be required for the synthesis of macromolecules
necessary for cell mass duplication during the division of rapidly
proliferating cells (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011). A recent study
(Almeida et al., 2010) in HEK293 cells revealed that proliferation is
associated with an increase in glycolysis and PFKFB3 protein
expression. Furthermore, Colombo et al. found that proliferation
was accompanied by an increase in the expression of the most
abundant splice variant of PFKFB3 in T lymphocytes and that the
proportion of cells in S phase positively correlated with the rate of
lactate generation (Colombo et al., 2010). Our results demonstrate
an increase in PFKFB3 mRNA and protein expression, which is
accompanied by reactive proliferation in cultured cortical astrocytes
, after OGD/R. Minchenko et al. found that PFKFB3 mRNA was
abundant in rat cortical astrocytesin vitrounder normal conditions,
and its expression was significantly increased in the brain under
hypoxic conditions in vivo (Minchenko et al., 2003). Therefore,
these studies indicate that up-regulation of PFKFB3 is associated
with astrocyte proliferation and may contribute to astrocyte proliferation
after OGD/R.
Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian
brain and play an important role in the regulation of cerebral energy
metabolism. Under hypoxia, glucose metabolism is strongly stimulated
through the glycolysis pathway in astrocytes (Zwingmann and
Leibfritz, 2003). Amaral et al. investigated the metabolic alterations
in astrocytes after ischemia. They found glycolytic metabolism was
predominant in the late recovery after ischemia (Amaral et al.,
2010). PFKFB3, an isoform of PFK2, is a critical mediator of glycolysis.
PFKFB3 exhibits a strong net kinase activity; thus the observed
repression of PFKFB3 should result in reduced glycolysis as a result
of decreased fructose-2,6-bisphosphate production. The latter
compound is an activator of PFK1, which is the key regulator of the
mammalian glycolytic pathway. Thus, inhibition of PFKB3 expression
may result in diminished allosteric activation of PFK1, reduced
glycolytic consumption of glucose-6-phosphate, and reduced
glycolytic flux. For example, overexpression of a phosphatasedeficient PFKFB in the heart led to increased glycolysis, and
chronic elevation of glycolysis in failing hearts could be injurious to
an already compromised heart (Wang et al., 2008). Additionally,
knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in N-43/5 neurons decreases the rate
of glycolysis. By contrast, overexpression of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in N-43/5
neurons increases the rate of glycolysis (Li et al., 2013). However,
Ando et al. suggest that elevated expression of PFKFB3 alone is not
sufficient to increase glycolysis, which requires ectopic expression of
HK2 (Masaru Ando et al., 2010). In our results, PFKFB3 siRNA abolished
the up-regulation of PFKFB3 protein and the increase in lactate
release after OGD/R in astrocytes. These data demonstrate that
PFKFB3 up-regulation is required to maintain glycolytic flux in astrocytes
after OGD/R.

Several previous studies have demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin
ligase APC/C-Cdh1 simultaneously regulates the cell cycle and
metabolism by selectively targeting key regulatory enzymes for
proteasomal degradation (Herrero-Mendez et al., 2009; Li and
Zhang, 2009). APC/C-Cdh1 substrates are targeted for degradation
through specific recognition motifs, including the KEN box. PFKFB3,
a key regulator of glycolysis, contains a KEN box motif (Herrero-
Mendez et al., 2009). During cell cycle progression, PFKFB3 is
generated continuously and ubiquitinated until it becomes active
only when Cdh1, the activating protein of APC/C, is absent during
the last two thirds of the G1 phase (Estevez-Garcia et al., 2014). In
physiological conditions, low Cdh1 protein abundance and reduced
APC/C-Cdh1 activity have been reported in astrocytes; however,
overexpression of Cdh1 in astrocytes decreased PFKFB3 protein
expression (Herrero-Mendez et al., 2009). These studies indicate
that Cdh1 is an upstream regulator of PFKFB3 in astrocytes. In
previous studies, we found that hippocampal Cdh1 activity was
significantly decreased after global cerebral ischemia in rats in vivo
(Zhang et al., 2011), and that Cdh1 expression was decreased in
astrocytes after OGD/R in vitro (Qiu et al., 2013). In the present
study, we found that PFKFB3 expression was increased in astrocytes
after OGD/R. Therefore, we hypothesized that Cdh1 may be
involved in PFKFB3 regulation in astrocytes during OGD/R. To test
this hypothesis, a Cdh1-expressing lentivirus was constructed to
investigate the effects of Cdh1 on PFKFB3 expression. By observing
GFP under fluorescence microscopy and by detecting a GFP fusion
protein and downstream substrates (Skp2 and SnoN) by western
blotting, we previously revealed that infection with the Cdh1-
expressing lentivirus can effectively increase APC/C-Cdh1 activity
in astrocytes (Qiu et al., 2013). In the present study, infection with
the Cdh1-expressing lentivirus resulted in down-regulation of
PFKFB3 in astrocytes. In addition, Cdh1 protein overexpression also
decreased PFK1 expression and lactate release. These results are
compatible with the notion that OGD/R inhibits APC/C-Cdh1 activity
, as measured by its ability to promote the degradation of
PFKFB3, an already known APC/C-Cdh1 substrate (Herrero-Mendez
et al., 2009) and suggests that Cdh1 may alter glucose metabolism
in astrocytes via degradation of PFKFB3.
The upstream regulation of APC/C-Cdh1 in OGD/R can be
speculated from previous studies. On one hand, numerous studies
showed that cell cycle regulators including cyclins, cyclin
dependent kinases (CDKs) were aberrantly activated after CNS
injuries, including ischemia and trauma (Qiu et al., 2013;
Rashidian et al., 2005; Timsit and Menn, 2007). Cell cycle inhibition
provides neuroprotection and reduces glial proliferation
and scar formation after CNS injuries (Di Giovanni et al., 2005; Qiu
et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2007). On the other hand, Cdh1 is mediated
by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) occurred on multiple
conserved proline-directed sites, which promote its nuclear
export and inhibit its binding to APC (Jaquenoud et al., 2002).
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the activity of APC/CCdh1
is regulated in excitotoxicity (Maestre et al., 2008, 2008;
RodriguezeRodriguez et al., 2012), i.e. a condition well known
to occur during OGD/R. In those studies, during excitotoxicity, the
concomitant Ca2þ rise activates calpain, which promotes p25
formation from p35, thus over-activating Cdk5 that hyperphosphorylates
Cdh1 leading to APC/C-Cdh1 inhibition. Therefore,
in consistent, excitotoxicity occurring during OGD/R could regulate
the activity of APC/C-Cdh1.
There are some limitations in our study. Compared with isotopic
labeled measurement (RodriguezeRodriguez et al., 2012), lactate
accumulation may be not a reliable indicator of glycolysis activity,
as other sources and pathway (e.g. glutamine and the pentose
phosphate pathway) can contribute to the lactate formation.
However, the increase of lactate released into the medium was
considered as one marker of enhanced glycolysis function (Haji-
Michael et al., 1999). This method was also used for evaluation of
glycolysis capacity in other studies (Almeida et al., 2010).
PFKFB3 is also regulated by several proteins, including HIF-1,
PTEN, Akt, and MK2, through various mechanisms in cancer cells
(Cordero-Espinoza and Hagen, 2013; Duran et al., 2009;
Novellasdemunt et al., 2013; Obach et al., 2004; Yalcin et al.,
2009). Thus, Cdh1 is likely not the only regulator of PFKFB3 and
may be regulated by other proteins in astrocytes after OGD/R.
Further studies are required to investigate the potential mechanisms
underlying the regulation of PFKFB3 in astrocytes. PFKFB3-

mediated glucose metabolism may be an important target for
neuroprotection and could be a promising therapeutic target in
central nervous system diseases characterized by astrocyteassociated
damage.
5. Conclusions
Overall, the findings presented here revealed activation and
proliferation of astrocytes in response to OGD/Rin vitro, which was
paralleled by up-regulation of PFKFB3 protein expression. Knockdown
of PFKFB3 using siRNA inhibited astrocyte proliferation
through decreased glycolysis after OGD/R in vitro. Overexpression
of Cdh1, an upstream regulator of PFKFB3, decreased PFKFB3 and
PFK1 expression, which then reduced glycolyticflux. This suggests
that PFKFB3 and Cdh1 maybe promising therapeutic targets for
nervous system injuries associated with excessive astrogliosis.
