Stroke pathogenesis involves complex oxidative stress-related pathways. The nuclear
factor erythroid-2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathways
have been considered molecular targets in pharmacologic intervention for
ischemic diseases. Andrographolide, a labdane diterpene, has received increasing
attention in recent years because of its various pharmacologic activities. We determined
that andrographolide modulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling cascade in primary cerebral endothelial cells (CECs)
to provide positive protection against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-
induced ischemic stroke in rats. In the present study, andrographolide (10 mM)
increased HO-1 protein and messenger RNA expressions, Nrf2 phosphorylation,
and nuclear translocation in CECs, and these activities were disrupted by a p38
MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, but not by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor
PD98059 or c-Jun amino-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125. Similar results were
observed in confocal microscopy analysis. Moreover, andrographolide-induced
Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions were significantly inhibited by Nrf2 small
interfering RNA. Moreover, HO-1 knockdown attenuated the protective effect
of andrographolide against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced CEC death.
Andrographolide (0.1 mg/kg) significantly suppressed free radical formation,
blood-brain barrier disruption, and brain infarction in MCAO-insulted rats, and these
effects were reversed by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX. The mechanism is
attributable to HO-1 activation, as directly evidenced by andrographolide-induced
pronounced HO-1 expression in brain tissues, which was highly localized in the

through p38 MAPK regulation, confirming that it provides protection against
MCAO-induced brain injury. These findings provide strong evidence that andrographolide
could be a therapeutic agent for treating ischemic stroke or neurodegenerative

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is an acute neurologic event leading to neural
tissue death in the brain, causing motor, sensory,
and cognitive function loss. It is the second leading
cause of death after coronary heart disease in developed
countries.1 Brain tissue is particularly susceptible
to oxidative damage, and an excessive reactive
oxygen species (ROS) level is closely related to
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in stroke.2 Therefore,
antioxidant-like compounds have been used in ischemic
stroke prevention and treatment. The expression of
phase II enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1),
is regulated by nuclear factor erythroid-2–related factor
2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor.3Nrf2 controls the coordinated
expression of critical antioxidant and detoxification
genes through a promoter sequence called the
antioxidant response element. Phase II enzymes
including HO-1, glutathione S-transferases, and
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
quinone oxidoreductase synergistically provide protection
by regulating and maintaining intracellular redox
states.4 Of these enzymes, HO-1 is reported to have
the most antioxidant response elements on its promoter,
making it a highly effective therapeutic target for protection
against neurodegenerative diseases. HO-1 provides
protection in part by degrading its pro-oxidant
substrate, heme, and releasing the antioxidants biliverdin
and bilirubin.5 A study demonstrated the therapeutic
potential of targeting the Nrf2 or HO-1
pathway, or both, in brain injury after ischemic stroke.6
Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role of
Nrf2 activation in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
disease prevention.7
Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways may play essential roles
in regulating apoptosis, cell death, and cell survival after
brain ischemia.8 The role of p38 MAPK in brain
ischemia remains highly controversial at present.
Some studies showed that activation of p38 MAPK
might facilitate neuronal death after brain ischemic
insult.9 On the contrary, the others indicated that the
activation of p38 MAPK protected neurons from
ischemic stimulation.10 These authors also suggested
that permanent p38 MAPK activation may contribute
to ischemic tolerance in cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) neurons
of the hippocampus, and p38 MAPK cascade
components can be target molecules for modifying
neuronal survival after ischemia.10 Therefore, the activation
of p38 MAPK in vitro and in middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced brain tissues leads

Background
Stroke pathogenesis involves complex oxidative
stress-related pathways. The nuclear factor
erythroid-2–related factor 2 and heme oxygenase
1 pathways have been considered molecular targets
in pharmacologic intervention for ischemic
diseases. Andrographolide has received increasing
attention in recent years because of its novel mechanisms
and various pharmacologic activities and
has been marketed worldwide.
Translational Significance
Andrographolide increased HO-1 protein and
messenger RNA expressions, Nrf2 phosphorylation
, and nuclear translocation through p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase regulation in
cerebral endothelial cells. Moreover, andrographolide-mediated
HO-1 induction significantly
suppressed free radical formation, blood-brain barrier
disruption, and brain infarction in middle cerebral
artery occlusion–insulted rats. These findings
provide strong evidence that andrographolide
may be a therapeutic agent for treating ischemic
stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.

us to speculate that p38 MAPK expression may associate
with neuroprotective effects.
Endothelial cell dysfunction is a vital factor in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis
, stroke, diabetes, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
and hypertension.4 Cerebral endothelial cells (CECs)
play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function
of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is critical
for normal brain function.11 Moreover, BBB disruption
by free radicals was associated with cellular damage in
neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke.12 In
addition to maintaining BBB integrity, CECs are equipped
with a defense system including Nrf2 and HO-1.13
As stated previously, increasing evidence suggests that
Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling is involved in cerebral
ischemic diseases and thus may be a promising target
for treating ischemic stroke.14 Several studies have
focused on the ability of synthetic drugs or bioactive
compounds to provide protection against stroke by activating
the Nrf2 and HO-1 pathways.15
Andrographolide, the major active constituent of Andrographis
paniculata leaf extracts, has been widely
used in traditional Asian medicine for treating upper
respiratory tract infections, fever, diarrhea, rheumatoid
arthritis, and laryngitis.16 Andrographolide inhibits
platelet activation by increasing cyclic guanosine
monophosphate-protein kinase G activation and subsequently
inhibiting the p38 MAPK-OHC–nuclear factor
(NF)-kB–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/
2 cascade.17,18 Furthermore, andrographolide enhances
NF-kB subunit p65 Ser536 dephosphorylation by
activating protein phosphatase 2A in rat vascular
smooth muscle cells.19Considering the beneficial properties
of andrographolide and the potential roles of the
Nrf2 and HO-1 pathways, we used in vivo ischemic
models to analyze whether andrographolide exerts neuroprotective
effects by stimulating Nrf2 or HO-1
signaling or both in CECs. We hypothesized that andrographolide
provides neuroprotection against
ischemic injury in MCAO-insulted rats, and the protective
mechanisms arise through activation of the p38
MAPK-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling cascade.

brain cortices were cut into small pieces and
homogenized uniformly. The resulting homogenate
was then digested using 1% (wt/vol) collagenase type
I and 1% (wt/vol) dispase II in a water bath at 37C
for 40 minutes. Subsequently, the suspension was
centrifuged at 1000 3 g for 10 minutes, and the
supernatant was discarded. The digested tissue pellet
was then resuspended in 20% (wt/vol) BSA and
subsequently centrifuged at 10003 g for 20 minutes at
4C. The resulting pellet containing the microvessels
was collected and washed before being plated
onto gelatin-coated dishes. CECs were maintained

tissues were collected and stored at280C until analysis.
Both cells and tissue samples were homogenized
and sonicated in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5; 1 mM MgCl
2
; 125 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X-100;
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 mg/mL
leupeptin; 10 mg/mL aprotinin; 25 mM bglycerophosphate
; 50 mM NaF; and 100 mM sodium
orthovanadate). The lysates were centrifuged at
12, 0003 g for 20 minutes at 4C. Samples of equal
amounts of proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
microporous membrane. The membrane was blocked
for 1 hour in a Tris buffered saline with Tween 20
(TBST) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and
0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% BSA.
Proteins were probed with specific primary antibodies
overnight at 4C. Samples were subsequently washed
3 times with TBST and exposed to the horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit
IgG for 1 hour. Immunoreactivity was observed using
enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantitative data were
obtained using a computing densitometer equipped
with a scientific imaging system (Biospectrum AC
System, UVP).
Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of
HO-1 messenger RNA. CECs (53 105) were seeded in
6-cm dishes and treated with 10 mM andrographolide
for the indicated times (0, 2, 4, and 6 hours), or
pretreated with 10 mM SB203580 for 40 minutes and
then treated with andrographolide for 6 hours. Total
RNA was isolated from cells by using the TRIzol
reagent, and reverse transcription–polymerase chain
reaction was then performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (GoScript Reverse
Transcription System). Primers for HO-1 and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
fragment amplification were as follows: HO-1, sense
(50-GCACTATGTAAAGCGTCTCC-30) and antisense
(50-GACTCTGGTCTTTGTGTTCC-30); GAPDH,
sense (50-GGCAAATTCAACGGCACAGT-30) and antisense
(50-AGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCC-30). GAPDH
was used as an internal control. Polymerase chain
reaction products were run on an agarose gel, stained
with SYBR Safe, and visualized using ultraviolet
illumination.
Separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear CEC
extracts. CECs (53 105) were treated with 10 mM andrographolide
for 30 minutes with or without 10 mM
SB203580. Subsequently, the cells were harvested using
TrypLE treatment, and cytoplasmic and nuclear CEC
proteins were extracted using the NE-PER kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lamin
B1 and a-tubulin were used as internal controls for
the nucleus and cytosol, respectively.
Immunofluorescent staining of CECs and brain
tissues. For the in vitro study, CECs (5 3 104) were
seeded on cover slides and treated with 10 mM andrographolide
with or without 10mM SB203580 for 6 hours
or 30 minutes. Subsequently, the CECs were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes.
After fixation, the cells were permeabilized using
0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 minutes and blocked with
5% BSA in PBS for 40 minutes. For the in vivo study,
rats were administered 0.1% DMSO or
andrographolide (0.1 mg/kg) for 6 hour and then
euthanized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. The brains were postfixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight. Before
sectioning, the brains were transferred to 30% (wt/vol)
sucrose in PBS. The brains were sliced in the coronal
plane at 55 mm and permeabilized with PBS
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 or blocked with 5%
donkey serum for 60 minutes.
The prepared samples (CECs or brain slices) were
incubated overnight at 4C with primary antibodies. Subsequently
, the samples were washed 3 times with PBS
and exposed to secondary antibodies for 2 hours. The
samples were then counterstained with DAPI (30 mM)
or PI (30 mM) and mounted using a mounting buffer
(Vector Laboratories) on a glass coverslip. The samples
were detected under a Leica TCS SP5 confocal spectral
microscope imaging system using an argon or krypton
laser (Mannheim, Germany). Quantitative analysis of
relative fluorescence was determined using ImageJ
1.48v software and a total of 100 cells were counted.
Knockdown of Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions in
CECs. CECs (53 104) were seeded on 12-well plates
and transfected with predesigned Nrf2 siRNA
(60 nM), HO-1 siRNA (60 nM), or scrambled siRNA
(60 nM) by using the Turbofect reagent. Predesigned
siRNA targeting the mouse Nrf2 (sc-37049; Santa
Cruz) or HO-1 (sc-35555; Santa Cruz) gene contained
3 target-specific 19-25-nt siRNAs. The scrambled
siRNA (Ambion) contained a 19-bp scrambled
sequence with 30-dT overhangs. After incubation with
Nrf2 or HO-1 siRNA, or scrambled siRNA for
24 hours, the CECs were then treated with 10 mM
andrographolide for 6 hours. The knockdown
efficiency of Nrf2 and HO-1 was confirmed through
Western blotting.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation. CECs (2 3 104) were
seeded in 96-well dishes and transfected with 60 nM
HO-1 siRNA for 24 hours, and consequently treated
with 10 mM andrographolide for 6 hours and then

, and,2% O
2
controlled by ProOx model
110; BioSpherix, Ltd)] for 8 hours at 37C. Another
group of cells was treated with 10 mM andrographolide
with or without 3 mM ZnPP for 6 hours before being
subjected to OGD. After OGD insult, medium without
glucose was replaced with normal growth medium and
cultures were returned to a normoxic condition (95%
air and 5% CO
2
) for reoxygenation. After 24 hours of
reoxygenation, cell viability was determined by the
MTT assay. To this, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/
mL MTT for 4 hours at 37C and then lysed in 100 mL
DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a
microplate reader.
MCAO-induced transient focal cerebral ischemia in
rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized using a mixture
containing 75% air and 3% isoflurane maintained in 25%
oxygen. The rectal temperature was maintained at
37 6 0.5C. The right middle cerebral artery was
occluded as described in our previous study.21 The
right common carotid artery was exposed, and a 4-0
monofilament nylon thread (25 mm) coated with
silicon (7 mm) was then inserted from the external to
the internal carotid artery until the tip occluded the
middle cerebral artery origin. After closure of the
operative site, anesthesia was withdrawn, and the rats
regained consciousness. During another brief
anesthesia period, the filament was gently removed
after 90 minutes of MCAO. An observer blinded to the
identity of the groups assessed the neurologic deficits
at 1 and 24 hours after reperfusion (before
euthanization) by using the forelimb akinesia (also
called the postural tail-hang) test, whereas the ischemic
insult was evaluated using the spontaneous rotational
test.22 Rats that did not show behavioral deficits at the
aforementioned time points after reperfusion were
excluded from the study. The rats were divided into 4
groups: (1) a sham-operated group, (2) a DMSO-
treated (50 mL) group, (3) an andrographolide-treated
(0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) group, and (4) an
andrographolide- and ZnPP-treated (0.1 mg/kg i.p. and
5 mg/kg i.p., respectively) group. All treatments were
administrated immediately after MCAO in all the
groups except the sham-operated group.
Evaluation of free radical production in brain
tissues. DHE was used to detect MCAO-induced free
radical production.23 Sham-operated and MCAO-
insulted (including the DMSO-, andrographolide-, and
andrographolide- and Znpp-treated groups) rats were
administered DHE (5 mg in 50 mL of DMSO) at the
femoral vein 21 hours after MCAO treatment. The rats
were euthanized 24 hours after MCAO surgery and
perfused with cold saline from the left ventricle for
10 minutes. Subsequently, whole-brain tissues were
immediately viewed under the IVIS Imaging System
200 Series (Xenogen Corp) for monitoring ROS
production. They were from separate groups of animals,
and data were expressed as total photon flux in a region
of interest and expressed as photons per second.
Evaluation of BBB permeability after MCAO. To assess
BBB permeability, a 3% (wt/vol) solution of Evans
blue dye in PBS was injected at the femoral vein
(4 mL/kg) into all the rats 24 hours after MCAO. The
dye was allowed to circulate for 24 hours. Evans blue
dye extravasation to the brain was visible to the naked
eye after the rats were perfused with 100 mL of PBS.
For quantifying the Evans blue dye, the brain tissue
was removed and divided into the right and left hemispheres.
Each hemisphere was cut and incubated individually
in 500 mL of formamide at 55C for 48 hours.
After incubation, the solution was centrifuged at
20,000 3 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was
collected and measured at 610 nm by using a Beckman
Coulter spectrophotometer (DU-7400, Fullerton, California
). The dye in each sample was quantified according
to a standard curve of Evans blue in formamide.
The optical density ratio was measured as the optical
density of the injured side relative to that of the contralateral
side for each rat. They were from separate groups
of animals.
Evaluation of the infarct volume after MCAO. After reperfusion
, all groups of rats were euthanized through
decapitation. The brains were cut into 2-mm coronal
slices, starting 1 mm from the frontal pole, and
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
Each stained brain slice was drawn using a
computerized image analyzer (Image-Pro Plus). The
calculated infarct areas were then compiled to obtain
the infarct volume (in cubic millimeters) per brain. To
compensate for edema formation in the ipsilateral
hemisphere, infarct volumes were expressed as
percentages of the contralateral hemisphere volume by
using the following formula: area of the intact
contralateral (left) hemisphere 2 area of the intact
region of the ipsilateral (right) hemisphere.21 They
were from separate groups of animals.
Statistical analysis. The data are expressed as the
means 6 standard error of the means of the results
and are accompanied by the number of observations.
The normality of the data was first tested using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The continuous variables
were compared using analysis of variance. When the
analysis indicated significant differences among group
means, each group was compared using the Newman-
Keuls method. P , 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Validation of primary mouse CECs and HO-1 induction
by andrographolide. To define the possible activation
of signaling pathways by andrographolide in CECs,
we identified mouse CECs, cultured to 85%–95%
confluence, by using immunofluorescence staining and
then performed Western blotting to characterize the effect
of andrographolide on HO-1, a typical antioxidant
target protein. As shown in Fig 1, A, primary culture
mouse CECs were characterized through
immunofluorescence staining by using factor VIII
(green) and vimentin (red) antibodies and observed
under a laser scanning confocal microscope. Blue
(DAPI staining) indicates the cell nuclei in CECs, and
the merged image (orange) shows cells that
concurrently expressed factor VIII and vimentin.
These results confirm that cultured cells isolated from
the mouse brain were CECs.
As shown in Fig 1, B and C, CECs were treated with
10 mM andrographolide for different durations
(0–6 hours), and HO-1 protein and messenger RNA
(mRNA) expressions were detected. Our results showed
that in primary CECs, andrographolide induced HO-1
protein and mRNA expressions in a time-dependent
manner. The induction was high for fixed 6-hour andrographolide
treatment. Furthermore, andrographolide
induced HO-1 protein expression at 5 and 10 mM concentrations
, and induction was prominent at
10 mM( P, 0.001; Fig 1, D).
p38 MAPK downstream signaling mediated HO-1
induction stimulated by andrographolide. Several studies
demonstrated that MAPKs regulate HO-1 expression.24
Hence, the phosphorylation of MAPKs (eg, ERK1/
2, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2) involved in
andrographolide-mediated HO-1 induction was
evaluated using Western blotting. The results showed
that ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2
phosphorylation markedly increased after the CECs
were treated with 10 mM andrographolide for
10 minutes (Fig 2, A). In addition, our results revealed
that andrographolide-mediated HO-1 protein and
mRNA expressions significantly decreased in the
presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580
(10 mM) (Fig 2, B and C); however, the ERK1/2
inhibitor PD98059 (20 mM) and JNK inhibitor
SP600125 (10 mM) did not affect HO-1 protein and
mRNA expressions because although both inhibitors
slightly reduced HO-1 protein and mRNA
expressions, the reduction was not significant
compared with that observed in andrographolidetreated
cells (P. 0.05, n5 5; Fig 2, B and C). We
performed a confocal microscopic study by using PI
staining (red fluorescence) to further confirm these
effects because this stain binds to the cellular nucleus.
The results revealed that 10 mM andrographolide
induced HO-1 expression and dispersion, as indicated
by increased green fluorescence (HO-1) compared
with that of control cells. However, the green
fluorescence intensities were markedly disrupted when
the cells were exposed to SB203580 (Fig 2, D, bottom
of the panels). These results suggest that p38 MAPK
plays an essential role in andrographolide-induced
HO-1 expression in CECs.
Activation of Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression by
andrographolide in primary CECs. To determine whether
andrographolide can activate Nrf2 signaling, primary
CECs were treated with 10 mM andrographolide for
different durations (0–30 minutes) and phospho-Nrf2
expression was measured using Western blotting. As
shown in Fig 3, A, phosphorylated Nrf2 expression
increased in a time-dependent manner during
andrographolide treatment, and a noteworthy increase
was observed at 30 minutes. Hence, we determined
whether andrographolide can induce Nrf2-stimulated
HO-1 expression. Scrambled siRNA (60 nM) and
Nrf2 siRNA (60 nM) were transfected into CECs for
24 hours. As shown in Fig 3, B, Nrf2 siRNA markedly
downregulated andrographolide-induced Nrf2 and
HO-1 protein expressions. These results illustrate that
andrographolide induces an increase in HO-1
expression by activating the Nrf2 signaling
pathway. In addition, the role of p38 MAPK in
downregulating Nrf2 phosphorylation was determined
in CECs after andrographolide treatment. The data
showed that SB203580 significantly inhibited Nrf2
phosphorylation after 30 minutes of andrographolide
treatment, suggesting that p38 MAPK may function as
an upstream regulator of Nrf2 activation (Fig 3, C).
Taken together, these results suggest that
andrographolide enhances HO-1 expression possibly
through the p38 MAPK-Nrf2 pathway in primary
cultured CECs.
Andrographolide-induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2
inCECs. To explore the potential molecular mechanisms
causing HO-1 induction, Nrf2 nuclear translocation in
response to andrographolide was examined. Cytosolic
and nuclear proteins were isolated from CECs
30 minutes after 10 mM andrographolide treatment.
Western blotting was performed using the Nrf2
antibody to distinguish nuclear translocation. The
a-tubulin and lamin B1 antibodies were used as
cytosolic and nuclear markers, respectively. As shown
in Fig 4, A, a marked translocation of Nrf2 from the
cytosol to the nucleus was observed in
andrographolide-treated cells and was reversed by
SB203580. Immunocytochemical staining confirmed

the increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 in CECs
treated with andrographolide observed in confocal
microscopic imaging analysis (Fig 4, B). The staining
results showed that Nrf2 (green staining) was almost
sequestered in the resting control cell cytoplasm.
However, treatment with andrographolide for
30 minutes increased Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus
(light blue staining) by approximately 1.5-fold
compared with the control (ctl) groups as determined
by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of nuclear
Nrf2, and this effect was significantly reduced in the
presence of SB203580 by approximately 26%
compared with andrographolide-treated groups
(Andro) (Fig 4, B, right panel). Moreover, the data
showed that there are approximately 24%, 56%, and
46% of cells with Nrf2 translocation in the control

Andrographolide protects OGD-induced CEC death via
HO-1. As shown in Fig 4, C (left panel),
andrographolide-induced overexpression of HO-1 was
found to inhibit by HO-1 siRNA, which indicated that
HO-1 siRNA is effectively reacted with CECs. For the
purpose to further demonstrate that HO-1 plays a
crucial role in ischemic stroke, we have performed
additional in vitro OGD study because it is highly
mimic ischemic stroke model in vivo.25 As shown in
Fig 4, C (right panel), andrographolide (10 mM)
significantly reversed OGD-induced cell death in
CECs. Furthermore, it is proved that knockdown of
HO-1 by siRNA or ZnPP drastically inhibited cell
viability that was increased by andrographolide under
OGD condition, suggesting that andrographolide
ameliorated OGD-induced cell injury via HO-1
signaling.
Disruption of MCAO-induced free radical formation,
brain edema, and infarction through HO-1 expression
upregulation by andrographolide. Studies have reported
that cerebral ischemia-induced excessive free radical
production may exacerbate ischemic damage,
including BBB breakdown, cerebral edema, and
infarction. Hence, this study investigated whether
andrographolide reduces cerebral ischemia- or
reperfusion-induced free radical production. As shown
in Fig 5, A, higher free radical production in the
brains of the MCAO-induced rats than in those of the
sham-controlled rats was observed using the IVIS
Imaging System. However, andrographolide
administration (0.1 mg/kg) in rats markedly reduced
MCAO-induced free radical production, which was
reversed in the presence of the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP
(5 mg/kg) (Fig 5, A).26 In addition, we examined brain
edema after MCAO by using the Evans blue dye, a
marker of albumin extravasation, to evaluate BBB
permeability. Typical images of the Evans blue dye in
the brain tissue are shown in Fig 5, B. The MCAO-
insulted group exhibited a significant increase in
Evans blue extravasation (10.9 6 0.9 mg/g,
P, 0 .001, n5 8) in the ipsilateral hemisphere of rat
brains in the DMSO-treated group compared with the
sham-operated group (0.4 6 0.2 mg/g, n 5 8).

Andrographolide (0.1 mg/kg) treatment markedly
reduced the Evans blue extravasation (7.36 0.7 mg/g,
P , 0 .01, n 5 8), which was reversed by ZnPP
treatment (9.76 0.8 mg/g, P, 0.05, n5 8).
Cerebral infarction was examined using 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of 2-mm-thick
cerebrum slices 24 hours after MCAO reperfusion in
rats.Fig 5, Cshows typical photographs of coronal sections
of the sham-operated, DMSO-treated,
andrographolide-treated, and andrographolide- and
ZnPP-treated groups before ischemic insult. No infarction
was observed in the sham-operated group, whereas
extensive lesions developed in the striatum and lateral
cortex in the MCAO group (Fig 5, C). Compared with
the DMSO-treated group, the infarct volume was
reduced in the andrographolide-treated group (andrographolide
, 22.3 6 2.0%, n 5 8 vs DMSO,
39.16 1.3%, n5 8, P, 0.001), and this reduction
was significantly reversed when the rats were treated
with andrographolide and ZnPP (35.0 6 1.7%,
P, 0.001, n5 8). These results illustrate that andrographolide
exerted protective effects against cerebral
ischemia in an MCAO rat model, as demonstrated by
decreases in free radical production, brain edema, and
infarct volume possibly resulting from the upregulation
of HO-1 expression.
Andrographolide-induced HO-1 expression in rat brain
tissues. To confirm the in vitro results indicating that andrographolide
increases HO-1 expression in CECs and
that HO-1 induction is associated with reduced free
radical production, brain edema, and infarct volume,
we directly investigated the effect of andrographolide
on HO-1 expression in rat brain tissues. As shown in
Fig 6, A, andrographolide (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a
significant increase in HO-1 expression in the wholebrain
homogenates compared with the DMSO-treated
group. In addition, confocal microscopy was
performed to detect HO-1 expression and distribution
after andrographolide treatment. The brain sections
were costained with the endothelial cell–specific
marker RECA-1 (red) and the HO-1–specific antibody
(green) as shown in Fig 6, B. The cerebral capillary
(,10 mm in diameter) was clearly observed in the
brain sections by using RECA-1 (red) in both the
DMSO- and andrographolide-treated groups. HO-1
expression (green) was high in the andrographolidetreated
group and was highly colocalized with the
cerebral capillary (merged image, yellow) compared
with that in the DMSO-treated group (Fig 6, B),
indicating that marked HO-1 expression induced by
andrographolide mainly localized in the cerebral
capillary.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we identified an essential mechanism
underlying the neuroprotective effects of andrographolide
in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This is the
first study on andrographolide-stimulated HO-1 expression
in primary cultured mouse CECs and MCAO-
insulted brain tissues in rats. Our data show that andrographolide
enhances protective defense mechanisms
through the HO-1 upregulation, and imply targeting
the p38 MAPK-Nrf2 pathway is a promising approach
for therapeutic intervention for ischemic stroke. In a
previous study, primary CEC cultures were proposed
to preserve similar phenotypic characteristics of the
brain endothelium.27 Thus, we isolated CECs from
mice and primary cultures to investigate the mechanism
of andrographolide-mediated HO-1 expression.
Because primary CEC cultures are easily contaminated
by other cells, factor VIII and vimentin markers were
used to confirm that the isolated cells were CECs.
HO-1 expression is controlled by numerous signaling
pathways and transcription factors, the most salient of
which are Nrf2, activator protein-1, and NF-kB.28
Among them, the redox-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 system
plays a central role in HO-1 induction.29HO-1 has been
stated to protect tissues by renovating redox homeostasis
and tumbling inflammation because of its antioxidant
, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties.
HO-1 plays a vital role in neuroprotection because it degrades
free heme and its metabolites, CO, biliverdin, or
bilirubin, and can directly provide cytoprotection. HO-1
has been considered particularly valuable in neuroprotection
against cerebral ischemia, because HO-1
knockout mice exhibited greater ischemic damage
than did wild-type mice.30 Our current results also exhibited
that HO-1 knockdown could partially reduce
andrographolide-mediated protection when CECs
were subjected to OGD, which is a widely used
then subjected to OGD insult. Another group of cells was treated with 10 mM andrographolide with or without
3 mM ZnPP for 6 hours before being subjected to OGD insult for 8 hours. After reoxygenation, cell viability
was determined by MTT assay (right panel). The profiles (A–C) are representative examples of 5 similar experiments.

in vitro model of stroke.25Ding et al31reported that 11-
keto-b-boswellic acid is a triterpenoid compound from
extracts ofBoswellia serratathat provides neuroprotection
by inducing HO-1 expression. In another study
involving HO-1 stimulation by panaxatriol saponins,
the main components extracted from Panax notoginseng could effectively reduce OGD- or reperfusioninduced
injury in vitro.32 Our findings are consistent
with these observations, and provided evidence confirming
that andrographolide enhances HO-1 expression
in both CECs in vitro and brain tissues.
Nrf2 phosphorylation and translocation may be regulated
through several signal transduction pathways such
as MAPK pathways.33The p38 MAPK pathway plays a
crucial role in modulating the activity of numerous transcription
factors, leading to biological responses such as
cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and
plays different roles in various cerebral ischemia
phases. At present, the role of p38 MAPK in ischemia
remains highly controversial. A study reported that
p38 MAPK activation might expedite neuronal death after
ischemic insult.34 Conversely, other studies have reported
that p38 MAPK activation protects neurons from
ischemic stimulation.10 According to these findings,
Zhu et al35propose that p38 MAPKs assist as the kinase
responsible for mediating the neuroprotective functions
of hypoxia-inducible factor-1aand vascular endothelial
growth factor. A study indicated that isoflurane preconditioning
improves neuroprotection in rats by inducing
p38 MAPK phosphorylation and activation,36 possibly
because p38 MAPK inhibitors block isoflurane preconditioning
–induced protection, whereas p38 MAPK activators
induce neuroprotection by increasing p38 MAPK
phosphorylation.36 Although andrographolide induced
phosphorylation of 3 MAPKs in the present study, p38
MAPK seems to play the major role and upregulates
Nrf2 phosphorylation in the induction of downstream
HO-1 expression.
The Nrf2 signaling pathway may enhance cellular
resistance to ischemia- or reperfusion-induced oxidative
stress by mediating downstream antioxidant
proteins. A previous study reported that 11-keto-bboswellic
acid markedly increased Nrf2 expression in
primarily cultured astrocytes, the major glial nonneuronal
cells, and plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant
defense in the brain.31Similarly, ursolic acid, a
naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, was reported
to promote neuroprotection after cerebral
ischemia in mice by activating the Nrf2 pathway.37
To substantiate these results, in the present study, the
Nrf2 phosphorylation status was examined in cells
exposed to andrographolide treatment with a p38
MAPK inhibitor or Nrf2 siRNA. As observed in
studies, andrographolide stimulated Nrf2 phosphorylation
, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) remarkably
reduced this stimulation. A study also found that
SB203580 drastically decreased the phosphorylation
of p38 MAPK, and consequently abolished the neuroprotection.38 Furthermore, enhanced HO-1 protein
expression was observed in cells after andrographolide
treatment. Nevertheless, this induction was significantly
reduced when cells were treated with Nrf2
siRNA.
Moreover, andrographolide treatment significantly
increased Nrf2 expression in CEC nuclear extracts,
and the p38 MAPK inhibitor considerably reversed
this accumulation. Similarly, the confocal microscopic
study on the cellular localization of Nrf2 revealed that

nuclear immunofluorescence was more distinct in
andrographolide-treated CECs than in control cells,
and this effect was reversed by the p38 MAPK inhibitor,
as mentioned previously. Consistent with our findings in
this study, triterpenoids, such as maslinic acid and oleanolic
acid, were reported to significantly increase
Nrf2 expression, thus providing neuroprotection.39 A
study on wild-type and Nrf2-knockout mice showed
that Nrf2 reduces ischemic brain injury by preventing
oxidative stress.40 The HO-1 promoter has numerous
antioxidant reactive element sequences; Nrf2 can bind
to these sequences and induce its expression in a preferential
manner. Nrf2 siRNA treatment significantly
reduced the upregulation of its target gene HO-1 in a
previous study.31Therefore, our results indicate that andrographolide
stimulates HO-1 expression in CECs,
possibly through the p38 MAPK-Nrf2 pathway. Moreover
, a previous study has shown that andrographolide
owns neuroprotective effects via modulation of phosphoinositide
3-kinase-protein kinase B (Akt) pathways.41 Other evidence also suggested that
phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway regulates the
activity of Nrf2.42 These results evidence that the andrographolide
’s neuroprotective effects may also take
part via modulating other signaling pathways.
Cerebral vascular endothelial cells develop a barrier
that impedes the free flow of ions and polar molecules
from the blood to the brain tissues. Disruption of this
barrier during stroke is imperative because it might
lead to local edema caused by increased vascular
permeability, which in turn can reduce local perfusion.43 A study suggested that an effective neuroprotective
agent should be able to cross the BBB to
reach the target site in the brain.44 Brain ischemia is
characterized by an increase in ROS-mediated inflammatory
reactions, and excessiveROSproductioninthe
brain is associated with neurodegenerative processes.45 In this study, immunofluorescence using the
IVIS system provided morphologic and quantitative
evidence that andrographolide lowers MCAO-
induced free radical production at the ipsilateral border
zone. Focal ischemia, particularly when followed by
reperfusion, severely damages the BBB and enables
water and macromolecules to pass from the vessels
into the tissues. Therefore, BBB breakdown can be assessed
on the basis of the extravasation of tracers, such
as the Evans blue dye. In the present study, strong
extravasation of the Evans blue dye was observed after
MCAO. Conversely, andrographolide treatment significantly
restored BBB integrity, as confirmed by the
reduced extravasation of Evans blue at the MCAO-
insulted areas. A previous study suggested that the
HO-1 pathway is crucial for protecting the BBB from
oxidative stress in maintaining cellular homeostasis.46
ZnPP has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of
HO-1, and could regulate the HO-1 expression at the
transcriptional level.47 In the present study, we
confirmed that ZnPP reversed andrographolidemediated
free radical production, BBB degradation,
and infarction in brain tissues. Moreover, Western blotting
and confocal immunofluorescence results
confirmed that andrographolide induced HO-1 expression
in the cerebral capillary of the rat brain. Although
a number of studies have suggested that natural drugs,
including acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (50 mM,
in vitro and 20 mg/kg, in vivo),31 panaxatriol saponins
(16 mg/mL, in vitro),32 ursolic acid (130 mg/kg,
in vivo),37 and senkyunolide I (36 and 72 mg/kg,
in vivo),48 have been used for ischemic stroke therapy
via targeting Nrf2-HO-1 pathways, andrographolide
used in this study exhibited more potent neuroprotective
activity via modulating Nrf2-HO-1 signaling
even at a relatively low concentration of 10 mM,
in vitro and 0.1 mg/kg, in vivo. Moreover, an interesting
study compared the efficacy and potency of 2
synthetic Nrf2 activators as well as 54 natural compounds
to activate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway against
oxidative stress, and results showed that among the
tested natural compounds, andrographolide had the
highest efficacy on inducing Nrf2.49In conclusion, according
to our thorough literature review, this is the
first study demonstrating that andrographolide can
enhance HO-1 expression in both primary mouse 
CECsandratbraintissues.Inaninvivostudy,andrographolide
treatment attenuated ischemic injury in an
MCAO model by stimulating HO-1 expression by
reducing free radical production, brain edema, and
infarct size in brain tissues. These molecular findings
provide insights into the mechanisms underlying HO-
1 induction through the p38 MAPK-Nrf2 signaling
pathway and evidence that andrographolide may possesses
neuroprotective properties.
