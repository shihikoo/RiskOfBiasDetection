Background and Purpose—Netrin-1 (NT-1) stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro and promotes focal
neovascularization in the adult brain in vivo. This in vivo study in mice investigated the effect of NT-1 hyperexpression on
focal angiogenesis and long-term functional outcome after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).
Methods—Adeno-associated viral vectors carrying either the NT-1 gene (AAV–NT-1) or GFP (AAV-GFP) were generated
and injected into the brains of separate groups of 93 mice. Seven days later, tMCAO followed by 7–28 days of
reperfusion were carried out. Histological outcomes and behavioral deficits were quantified 7–28 days after tMCAO.
Small cerebral vessel network and angiogenesis were assessed 28 days after tMCAO, using synchrotron radiation
microangiography and immunohistochemistry.
Results—Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed that on the day of tMCAO, NT-1 hyperexpression had been achieved
in both normal and ischemic hemispheres. Immunofluorescence imaging showed that NT-1 expression was primarily in
neurons and astrocytes. Ischemia-induced infarction in the NT-1 hyperexpression group was attenuated in comparison to
saline or AAV-GFP–treated groups (P0.01). Similarly, neurological deficits were greatly improved in AAV–NT-1–treated
mice compared with mice in saline or AAV-GFP–treated groups (P0.05). In addition, angiogenesis was increased in
AAV–NT-1–treated mice compared with the other 2 groups (P0.05). In vivo synchrotron radiation microangiography 28
days after tMCAO revealed more branches in AAV–NT-1–treated mice than in other groups.
Conclusions—AAV–NT-1 induced NT-1 hyperexpression before tMCAO reduced infarct size, enhanced neovascularization
, and improved long-term functional recovery. (Stroke. 2012;43:838-843.)

Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability and a
significant burden on public health worldwide. Because many
drugs that showed neuroprotection in animal stroke models
failed to show benefits in clinical trials, new strategies are
needed in developing approaches to stroke therapy. An ideal
restorative approach to enhancing long-term functional recovery
after stroke should promote both postischemic neuronal regeneration
and vascular perfusion in ischemic regions.
Netrin-1 (NT-1), a protein conserved during evolution and
initially purified from chick embryos, was found to provide
key guidance cues for the development of commissural
axons.1 NT-1 receptors include the DCC (Deleted in Colorectal
Cancer) and UNC5 (uncoordinated-5) families, both of
which belong to the transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily.2 NT-1 can either attract or repel axonal growth cones
through binding to its receptors.3,4 Furthermore, NT-1 is
crucial to maintain the survival of DCC-expressed and
UNC5H-expressed neurons.5 Because vascular and neural
systems share similar growth characteristics, there has been
speculation that NT-1’s role in axon guidance and survival
suggests it might similarly assist vascular network formation.6 NT-1, a potent vascular mitogen that stimulates in vitro
proliferation and adhesion of endothelial and vascular smooth
muscle cells,7 also acts as a survival factor for endothelial
cells through the blocking of its UNC5H2 receptor. Such
silencing of NT-1 during zebrafish development leads to
vascular defects.8 In mammalian models, NT-1 promotion of
neovascularization improves limb perfusion in hind limb
ischemia and reverses vascular and neural pathology in
diabetic mice.9 Previous in vivo studies found that NT-1

hyperexpression promotes neovascularization in the adult
mouse brain; and earlier in vitro studies demonstrated that
NT-1 hyperexpression induced proliferation, migration, and
tube formation of human cerebral endothelial cells and
human aortic smooth muscle cells.10However, roles for NT-1
in long-term neurological recovery after ischemic brain are
largely unexplored. We suggest that exogenous hyperstimulation
of NT-1 expression can promote neovascularization
after stroke from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) and improve subsequent functional outcomes. If
so, stimulation of NT-1 expression might serve as a potential
therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
To test this hypothesis in mice, we used an adeno-associated
viral vector with NT-1 (AAV–NT-1) to induce brain NT-1
hyperexpression at a later time, when we then caused experimental
stroke from tMCAO. During and after recovery we
investigated associations between NT-1 hyperexpression, attenuated
neural cell death, neovascularization, and improved
neurobehavioral outcomes.
Methods
AAV–NT-1 Viral Vector Production, Purification,
and Titer Determination
pAAV–NT-1 vector was generated by inserting the chicken NT-1
cDNA between 2 ITRs of pAAV-MCS plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad
, CA). pAAV–NT-1 was cotransfected with pHelper and
pAAV-RC plasmids into AAV293 cells by calcium phosphate
precipitation. The viruses were further purified by CsCl density
gradient ultracentrifugation. Viral titer was determined by RT-PCR
analysis of the gene content.11 Adeno-associated virus-IRES-hrGFP
(AAV–IRES-hrGFP) was simultaneously prepared as a control.
AAV-Mediated NT-1 Injection
Animal procedures were carried out according to a protocol approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Adult male CD-1
mice weighing 25 g to 30 g were anesthetized with ketamine (100
mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, Sigma, San Louis, MO) intraperitoneally.
A burr hole was drilled to the left pericranium 2 mm lateral
to sagittal suture and 1 mm posterior to coronal suture. A 10-L
syringe (WPI Inc, Sarasota, FL) was slowly inserted into the brain
3 mm under the dura. AAV suspension (2.5 L) with 3.5109
AAV–NT-1 particles was injected stereotactically at a rate of 0.2
L/min. After half amount of suspension was injected, the needle
was slowly withdrawn to 2 mm under the dura to finish injection of
the remaining AAV–NT-1 vector. Ten minutes after the completion
of injection, the needle was withdrawn from the animal over a course
of 15 minutes. The bone hole was sealed with bone wax and the
wound was closed. After sufficient awakening from anesthesia,
animals were returned to their cages for long-term recovery.
Transient MCAO Model
Seven days after the AAV–NT-1 injection, animals were anesthetized
with 1.5% isoflurane in 70/30 nitrogen/oxygen gas for MCAO.
Body temperature was maintained at 370.5°C throughout the
surgical procedure, using a thermal blanket. The procedure of
tMCAO was performed as described previously with some modification.12 Briefly, after isolation of the common carotid artery,
external and internal carotid arteries, left MCA was occluded by a
6–0 nylon suture coated with silica gel. Reperfusion was achieved
by partially withdrawing the suture from the internal carotid artery to
the common carotid artery after 60 minutes of occlusion. The
reperfusion was maintained for up to 28 days.
Infarct Volume Measurement
Brains were removed and frozen immediately 7 days after tMCAO.
A series of 20-m-thick coronal sections from anterior commissure
to hippocampus were cut and mounted on slides. The sections were
fixed and stained, using cresyl violet. Sections were imaged and
digitized, and the border between infarct and noninfarct tissue was
outlined using Image J (National Institutes of Health). Infarct volume
was calculated by subtracting the volume of intact area in the
ipsilateral hemisphere from the whole volume of the contralateral
hemisphere.

Behavioral Tests
Mice were trained for 3 days before AAV–NT-1 injection. Baseline
values were generated by averaging 3 trials. Animals were tested at
1–4 weeks after tMCAO. Beam-walking and rotarod tests were
performed as described previously.13
For the beam-walking test, mice were trained to traverse a
horizontally elevated square beam with 5-mm side length to reach an
escape platform placed 1 meter away. Mice were placed on one end
of the beam, and the latency to traverse 80% of the beam toward the
escape platform was recorded. Motor test data were analyzed as
mean latency to cross the beam from 3 trials.
For the rotarod test, the task requires the mice to balance on a
rotating rod. Animals were allowed a 1 minute adaptation period on
the rod at rest, after which the rod was steadily accelerated to 40
revolutions per minute over 2 minutes, and time spent on the rod was
recorded. Motor test data were analyzed as mean duration on the
rotarod from 3 trials.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the protocol
described previously.10 After blocking with 10% bovine serum
albumin, brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies at
the following dilutions: NT-1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc,
Santa Cruz, CA), DCC (1:300; Santa Cruz), UNC5H2 (1:300; R&D
systems, Tustin, CA), NeuN and GFAP (1:500; Millipore Inc,
Billerica, MA), GluT-1 (1:300; Thermo, Waltham, MA), CD31
(1:300; R&D systems), and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen
(PCNA, 1:1000; Abacm, Cambridge, England) overnight at 4°C.
Sections were then incubated with biotinylated or fluorescenceconjugated
secondary antibodies. Each experiment had appropriate
positive and negative controls.
Microvessel Counting
Frozen coronal sections (20m thick) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
at room temperature for 10 minutes and then incubated
with fluorescein-lycopersicin esculentum lectin (1:400, Vector Laboratory
, Burlingame, CA) overnight at 4°C. Microvessel density was
quantified by counting the number of microvessels in 3 microscopic
fields at the left, right, and bottom of the peri-infarct area of striatum.
Western Blot Analysis
An equal amount total protein of brain sample was loaded on 10%
resolving gel for electrophoresis. Subsequently, proteins were transblotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Inc, Florham
Park, NJ). The membrane was placed in 5% nonfat milk in 0.1%
TBST for 1 hour to block nonspecific binding and immunoprobed
with NT-1 primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After washing with

TBST, the blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature and then reacted with an
enhanced ECL substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The result of
chemiluminescence was recorded with an imaging system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).
Synchrotron Radiation Microangiography In Vivo
Synchrotron radiation microangiography was performed at Beam
line 13W of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. A PE-10
tube connected with a syringe pump (Longerpump Inc, Baoding,
China) was carefully inserted into the proximal external carotid
artery of the tMCAO mice after 28 days of reperfusion. The mouse
was placed perpendicular to the X-ray beam, lying on its right side.
X-ray energy was 33.3 keV, just above the iodine K-edge energy.
Nonionic iodine contrast agent (350 mg/mL, Omnipaque, GE,
Fairfield, CO) was injected from external carotid artery into internal
carotid artery at a rate of 2 mL/min, with a total volume of 100L.
The CCD camera was placed 650 mm from the animal. Dynamic
images were obtained every 172 ms, with a resolution of 13m per
pixel. Six animals per group were subjected to synchrotron radiation
imaging.
Statistical Analysis
Parametric data in different groups were compared using a 1-way
ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. All data were
presented as meanSD. A probability value of5% was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy showed many GFP-positive cells in
both adjacent and distal to the needle tracks of the ipsilateral
hemisphere (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis showed that
NT-1 expression was significantly increased in AAV–NT-1–
injected mice, compared with AAV-GFP or saline-injected
mice (Figure 1B, P0.05). Immunocytochemistry showed
substantial numbers of NT-1–positive cells in the brain 7 days
after AAV–NT-1 injection. However, NT-1–positive cells
were barely detected in the mouse brain treated with AAVGFP
or saline. Double-labeled immunostaining revealed that
NT-1 proteins were expressed primarily in neurons and
astrocytes but not endothelial cells (Figure 1C). In addition,
expression of NT-1 receptors (DCC and UNC5H2) was found
in neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells (Figure 1D).

Infarct Size After Stroke
Next, we examined whether AAV-mediated NT-1 hyperexpression
affected the outcome after focal ischemia. The
modified suture model produced stable infarct that is primarily
striatal. As shown in Figure 2, AAV–NT-1–treated ischemia
mice reduced infarction volume compared with that
observed in saline or AAV-GFP–treated ischemia mice
(AAV–NT-12.61.7, saline9.72.5, and AAVGFP8.82.9 mm3;P0.01), suggesting that NT-1 affected
histological outcome after focal ischemia.
Neurological Outcomes
We then determined whether AAV-mediated NT-1 hyperexpression
affected the neurological deficits after focal ischemia.
Neurobehavioral outcome was measured at 1–4 weeks
after tMCAO. Beam-walking and rotarod tests indicated that
there was not significant difference in performance among
saline-treated, AAV-GFP–, and AAV–NT-1–treated groups
before tMCAO. However, neurological deficits measured by
the beam-walking and rotarod tests were significantly improved
in AAV–NT-1–treated mice than in saline-treated or
AAV-GFP–treated mice at 1, 2, and 4 weeks of reperfusion.
(Figure 3, P0.05).
Neovascularization
We confirmed that the number of microvessels in peri-infarct
area was significantly increased in AAV–NT-1–treated mice
compared with the saline and AAV-GFP–treated mice (Figure
4, P0.05). Dual-labeled immunofluorescence showed
that PCNA-positive cells expressed CD31, indicating the
presence of proliferating endothelial cells. Significantly more
PCNA/CD31-positive cells were observed in AAV–NT-1–
treated mice than in saline and AAV-GFP–treated groups
(Figure 5; AAV–NT-19.82.8, AAV-GFP2.81.2, and
saline2.71.6 cells/field, P0.001).
Synchrotron Radiation Microangiography
Using synchrotron radiation angiography in living animals,
we also found that branches of left MCA in AAV–NT–1
treated mice were greater than that in the control groups 28
days after tMCAO, suggesting that NT-1 hyperexpression
could promote local angiogenesis and new vascular system
remodeling after focal ischemia (Figure 6). The number of
MCA branches within the control group or the NT-1–treated
group was consistent. However, quantification of branches
using synchrotron radiation angiography is a challenge same
as in the CTA/MRA quantification. We are currently developing
software to quantify angiogenesis based on synchrotron
radiation angiography.
Discussion
Increased AAV-mediated NT-1 protein in the mouse brain
significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral
outcome compared with the saline and AAV-GFP–
treated mice. Immunohistochemistry and synchrotron radiation
angiography demonstrated that microvessel density and
collateral vessels were increased in AAV–NT-1–treated mice,
suggesting that NT-1 promoted local neovascularization and
vessel remodeling in injured brain. In the present study, we
achieved NT-1 hyperexpression in neurons and astrocytes in
the ischemic brain using AAV–NT-1 virus. NT-1 receptors
including DCC and UNC5H2 were expressed in neurons,
astrocytes, and endothelial cells of the brain after tMCAO.
AAV–NT-1–mediated gene transfer is a reliable tool for
long-term and steady expression of NT-1 protein. We chose
the AAV–NT-1 vector for delivery into mouse brains because
it has higher transduction ability with less toxicity.14,15 Our
previous study showed that NT-1 expression was significantly
increased at mRNA and protein levels in AAV–NT-
1–transfected HEK293 cells.10 In the present study, we
proved that AAV–NT-1 can effectively transfer into the
mouse brain neurons and astrocytes.
Netrins are highly conserved laminin-associated secret proteins.1 As one of the family members in mammals, NT-1 shows
several functions in neural system development. NT-1 would
induce mouse mammary epithelial cell invasion and migration,
mediate pancreatic epithelial cell adhesion, and promote tumor

epithelial cell survival.16–18 In ex vivo experiments, NT-1
induced the aortic endothelial cells proliferation and migration.
NT-1 hyperexpression increased the number of neovessels in
ischemic muscles and reversed neural and vascular pathology in
a diabetic rodent model.9 In cardiac ischemia and reperfusion,
NT-1 reduced myocardial infarct volume by DCC/ERK1/2
feedback mechanism in cardiac endothelial cells and myocardial
cells.19 NT-1 also protected renal tubular epithelial cells against
ischemia reperfusion-induced injury by increasing proliferation
and suppressing apoptosis of the cells.20 NT-1 hyperexpression
induced angiogenesis in adult mouse brains.10,21 Consistently,
our data showed that AAV–NT-1 can induce angiogenesis in the
ipsilateral hemisphere of an adult mouse model of focal ischemia.
Our data indicated that NT-1 hyperexpression reduced
infarct volume, which was associated with increased functional
microvessels in the peri-infarct area. We further demonstrated
that NT-1 hyperexpression effectively improved motor function
as assessed by beam walking and rotarod tests at different time
points after tMCAO. These findings suggest that NT-1 can
participate in neovascularization and vessel remodeling process,
which may contribute to long-term functional outcome after
ischemic brain injury. Further studies are needed to access the
rescue effects of NT-1 gene or protein transferred after cerebral
ischemia, which would be more valuable in translation to clinical
practice. With the development of safer virus-mediated gene
therapy techniques, NT-1 gene therapy might provide a promising
strategy for stroke treatment.
NT-1 receptors include DCC and UNC5 family members.22
NT-1 attracts axons through interaction with DCC and repels
axons by UNC5 homodimer or UNC5-DCC heterodimer.3,4,23
The involvement of UNC5H2 and DCC in NT-1–induced
angiogenesis is still a topic of debate.8,19,24–26We found DCC
and UNC5H2 receptors expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and
endothelial cells after tMCAO. They may participate in
NT-1–induced angiogenesis in mouse brains after tMCAO.
Further studies are needed to identify their roles and mechanisms
underlying NT-1–induced angiogenesis.
