Stroke induces rapid activation and expansion of microglia, but the main source of microgliosis is controversial. Here we
investigated the formation of microgliosis and infiltration of circulating cells in a photothrombosis stroke model by taking
advantage of parabiosis and two-photon microscopy. We found that a small population of blood-derived CX3CR1GFP/ + cells
infiltrated the cerebral parenchyma, but these cells did not proliferate and were phenotypically distinguishable from resident
microglia. CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells also displayed different kinetics from reactive microglia. The number of CX3CR1GFP/ +
infiltrating cells peaked on Day 5 after stroke and then decreased. The decline of these infiltrating cells was associated with an
active apoptotic process. In contrast, reactive microglia were recruited to the ischaemic area continuously during the first week
after stroke induction. Immunohistology and in vivo two-photon imaging revealed that cells involved in the process of microgliosis
were mainly derived from proliferating resident microglia. Expansion of microglia exhibited a consistent pattern and our
in vivo data demonstrated for the first time that microglia underwent active division in regions surrounding the ischaemic core.
Together, these results indicated that CX3CR1GFP/+ infiltrating cells and reactive microglia represented two distinct populations
of cells with different functions and therapeutic potentials for the treatment of stroke.

Introduction
Microglia account for 20% of glial cells in the CNS and exist
throughout the brain, spinal cord and retina (Sanchez-Lopez et al.,
2004; Saijo and Glass, 2011). As the immunocompetent cells in
CNS, microglia have important roles in the surveillance, support,
protection and restoration of tissue integrity (Davalos et al., 2005;
Neumann et al., 2009; Schafer et al., 2012). In the normal brain,
microglia exhibit ramified morphology and their processes undergo
rapid extension and retraction to monitor the microenvironment
(Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Wake et al.,
2009). When the rigorously regulated CNS homeostasis is disturbed
by pathological insults, microglia alter their morphology
and gene expression, and their numbers increase markedly at
the site of injury. This process of microglial activation, proliferation
and scar formation has been known as ‘microgliosis’ (Calvo and
Bennett, 2012).
It has been shown that precursors of microglia are of haematopoietic
/myeloid origin and colonize the CNS during embryonic and
early postnatal periods (Chan et al., 2007; Ginhoux et al., 2010;

Schulz et al., 2012; Kierdorf et al., 2013). In response to pathogens
or damage, microglia are rapidly activated and accumulate in
and around the lesion site (Davalos et al., 2005; Graeber, 2010).
The precise origin of these accumulated microglia is still in debate.
A major question has been whether circulating monocytes or myeloid
progenitors can contribute to the resident microglial pool
under pathological conditions.
Several studies using bone marrow chimeras with lethally
irradiated recipients favour the view that microglia are of haematopoietic
origin in the adult CNS (Kennedy and Abkowitz, 1997;
Flugel et al., 2001; Priller et al., 2001). These studies show that
donor-derived cells replace a considerable percentage of microglia
in the acceptors over time (Tanaka et al., 2003; Kokovay and
Cunningham, 2005; Priller et al., 2006). These findings suggest
that mobilized bone-marrow cells are able to pass through the
blood brain barrier (BBB) and differentiate into parenchymal
microglia (Brazelton et al., 2000; Priller et al., 2001; Simard and
Rivest, 2004; Djukic et al., 2006). However, there are concerns
about the physiological significance of the findings obtained from
irradiation bone marrow chimerism. Irradiation may cause apoptosis
of endothelial cells and impact the integrity of BBB (Li et al.,
2004; Ransohoff and Perry, 2009). In addition, transplantation of
bone marrow cells may lead to artificial persistence of haematopoietic
stem cells in the circulation (Ransohoff, 2007). To avoid the
potential influence of the bone marrow-irradiation model itself, an
alternative strategy using parabiotic mice was adopted. Without
irradiation and transplantation, data from parabiosis models support
an opposing view that little or no circulating cells may differentiate
into microglia in the parenchyma (Ajami et al., 2007; Saijo
and Glass, 2011), raising the possibility that circulating cells may
not cross the intact BBB under certain pathological conditions.
Accordingly, microglia are considered to expand as a result of
proliferation of CNS-resident cells in response to injuries
(Solomon et al., 2006; Ajami et al., 2007; Denes et al., 2007).
These apparent contradictory views are further complicated by
observations that circulating monocytes can enter the CNS but
fail to differentiate into microglia (Ajami et al., 2011).
In this work, we took advantage of a photothrombosis stroke
model, which is characterized by pathological disruption of BBB
permeability without intervention of irradiation or transplantation,
to address whether circulating cells could contribute to microgliosis.
Parabiotic animals and in vivo two-photon imaging were used
to assess the infiltration of circulating cells and the kinetics of
microglial activation and proliferation in the living mouse cortex.
Our data demonstrate that proliferation of local resident microglia
rather than recruitment of circulating myeloid cells is the main
source of microgliosis after ischaemic stroke. Division of microglia
was observed in real time in regions surrounding the ischaemic
core. We also found a small population of CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating
cells infiltrated brain parenchyma in parabiotic chimeras. These
cells exhibited a phenotype different from activated microglia and
had different kinetics during microgliosis. Although these circulating
cells infiltrated into the ischaemic zone, they did not undergo
division or differentiate into microglia. Together, our data suggest
that CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells and resident microglia may
have distinct functions in the pathological process of ischaemic
stroke.
Materials and methods
Animals
Transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in monocytes
, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and microglia in the brain were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in the Laboratory
Centre for Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University. In this mouse
strain, Cx3cr1 gene was replaced by a GFP reporter gene, and all
CX3CR1-expressing cells are expected to be GFP-positive (Jung
et al., 2000). Animals aged 8–10 weeks and weighing 18–24 g were
used throughout the study. All animals were bred in-house and maintained
in an aseptic environment supplied with clean water and rodent
chow ad libitum. All experimental procedures and protocols in the
study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Lanzhou
University, China.
Parabiosis
A modified parabiotic surgery was conducted following the procedure
as previously described (Wright et al., 2001; Rossi et al., 2005).
Pairs of weight-matched wild-type C57BL/6 and heterozygous
CX3CR1GFP/ + mice were subjected to parabiotic surgery. In brief,
animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/ml
ketamine and 2 mg/ml xylazine. The flanks of mice were shaved and
sterilized with betadine solution. An incision running from behind the
ear to the hip was generated on the opposite sides of two mice to be
paired. Opposing posterior muscles were joined with 5-0 chromic gut.
The scapulas of each animal were fixed together and the dorsal and
ventral skin edges were sutured with 4-0 silk. Mice were kept warm
until completely recovered from anaesthesia and fed with normal
water and food in a purpose-made container. During the first 7 days
after surgery, Tylenol was mixed in food to alleviate the pain as
needed. We have optimized the process and the survival rate after
surgery was 75%.
Flow cytometry
Chimerism of parabionts was determined by calculating percentages
of GFP-positive cells in blood monocytes. Fourteen days or 17 days
(3 days post-stroke induction) after surgery, the blood sample from
both mice of parabiont were collected into tubes containing anticoagulant
(acid-citrate-dextrose solution). After lysis of the red blood cells,
the samples were assayed with flow cytometry (BD, LSRFortessaTM) to 
measure the frequency of GFP-positive monocytes within the entire
monocytes in the GFP-negative mice of the parabionts.
Rose bengal photothrombosis model
To induce acute ischaemic stroke, we applied the rose bengal photothrombosis
model as described previously (Watson et al., 1985; Zhang
et al., 2005). Briefly, mice were deeply anaesthetized with ketaminexylazine.
A round cranial window (2 mm diameter) was thinned over
the right somatosensory cortex at coordinates of 1.5 mm from
bregma and 1.5 mm lateral on each mouse. The skull thickness
was reduced to 50mm by a high-speed drill. We injected rose
bengal (0.03 mg/g mouse; Sigma) into the tail vein, and then exposed
the cranial window under green light (535 25 nm) for 2 min to activate
the dye in a 1 mm2 area to form positional acute ischaemia.

Immunohistochemistry
The mice were anaesthetized with an overdose of urethane and then
transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.
The brains were dissected out and were post-fixed within
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4C. Mouse brains were sectioned
into 30mm coronary sections on a vibrating microtome. Primary antibody
staining was performed overnight at 4C. For primary antibodies
, we used rabbit antibodies to ionized calcium-binding adaptor
molecule 1 (IBA1; 1:500; Wako Pure Chemical Industries), C-C chemokine
receptor type 2 (CCR2; 1:100; Bioss), and activated caspase-3
(1:250; Bioss). Secondary antibodies included rhodamine-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit (1:200; ZSGB-BIO) and Alexa Fluor 350 donkey
anti-rabbit (1:200; California, Invitrogen). All sections were then
examined under an epifluorescence microscope or a confocal
microscope.
To label newly synthesized DNA, animals received intraperitoneal
injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg; Sigma) twice daily
for a maximum of 7 days. The first injection was done 12 h after stroke
induction. Mice were anaesthetized 3, 5 and 7 days after stroke induction
and then the brains were harvested and sectioned. For BrdU
staining, brain sections were rinsed for 10 min in double distilled water
and heated at 37C for 30 min in 2 M HCl. Sections were then neutralized
with 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 3 15 min and incubated
overnight with a rat monoclonal antibody against BrdU (1:500;
AbD Serotec) followed by a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary
antibody (1:200; ZSGB-BIO) for 1 h at room temperature. To
examine whether engulfment of BrdU-positive dead cells could affect
the evaluation of microglial proliferation, BrdU-labelled brain sections
were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:10 000; Sigma) for 10 min.
Confocal microscopy and in vivo
two-photon imaging
Images of fluorescently stained tissue samples were captured sequentially
on an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope
(Olympus). Slices were visualized with UPlan SApo 20/0.75 or
40/0.95 objectives. Stacks of 20 to 40 confocal optical sections
(1024 1024 pixel arrays) were collected at 1mm intervals in the z
dimension.
The procedure of in vivo two-photon imaging was performed as
described previously (Grutzendler et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005).
Briefly, skulls of anaesthetized mice were exposed and were glued to
a custom-made stainless steel plate with crazy glue. Then the skulls
were thinned to 25mm in thickness at the location where photothrombotic
stroke model had been made. To image blood vessels,
50ml 70 kDa-Texas Red dextran (10 mg/ml; Invitrogen) was injected
from tail-veins to label blood plasma. After that, animals were fitted
into a two-photon microscope and a 25 water-immersion objective
(25/1.05; Olympus) was used to acquire images with laser of
890 nm to excite both GFP and Texas Red dextran.
Data analysis
To calculate the volume of reactive microglia, brains were sectioned
into 30mm coronal slices and every third slice was collected and photographed.
Digital microphotographs of all brain sections were obtained
at fixed image acquisition parameters. The area of each slice was
measured using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The
volume of reactive microglia was calculated by summing the area of
reactive microgliosis in each section and multiplying by the distance
between sampled sections (90mm). To quantitate the expansion of
reactive microglia in CX3CR1 mice, three coronal slices were randomly
selected from each brain and the density and the width of reactive
microglia in different zones of the ischaemic area were calculated. To
quantitate the number of infiltrating cells in GFP-negative mice of the
parabionts, we counted all the infiltrating cells in each sampled slice.
The number of infiltrating cells in each animal was calculated by multiplying
the total number of infiltrating cells in all the sampled sections
by the sampling interval (3). Statistical comparison among three or
more groups were done by one-way ANOVA. Comparison of two
groups was performed by unpaired t-test (two tailed). All data are
presented as the mean the standard error of the mean. *P50.05,
**P50.01.
Results
Activation and expansion of microglia in
the subacute phase of ischaemic stroke
We first established blood chimerism in parabiotic mice. Two
female mice were conjoined subcutaneously, one of which was
wild-type and the other expressed GFP in microglia (Fig. 1A).
Blood chimerism of the parabionts was confirmed before stroke
induction. On average, 42.0 2.1% (n = 6) CX3CR1GFP/ + monocytes
were verified in the blood of the GFP-negative partner
13–14 days after parabiotic operation when an efficient anastomotic
circulation was established (Supplementary Fig. 1A), indicating
complete blood sharing had been established between
parabionts. Ischaemia was induced in a 1 mm2 area in both mice
in the somatosensory cortex by photothrombosis. There was no
significant change in blood chimerism before and after stroke
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). To determine the dynamic response of
microglia to ischaemic stroke, we harvested and examined brain
slices from CX3CR1GFP/ + mice of parabionts every day for 1 week
after stroke induction. In control animals, resident microglia displayed
ramified processes and low expression of GFP under
physiological conditions (Fig. 1B), and all the parenchymal microglia
in a healthy brain are IBA1 positive (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Consistent with others reports (Schilling et al., 2003; Neumann
et al., 2009), we observed a rapid formation of microgliosis
after stroke induction (Fig. 1C and D). Cells with swollen soma
accumulated around the ischaemic core region. Activated microglia
were characterized by upregulation of GFP expression, retraction
of ramified processes, as well as an increase in cell number in
the vicinity of the ischaemic site (Fig. 1C and D). Phenotypically,
97.3 0.5% of GFP-positive cells were IBA1 positive in
CX3CR1GFP/ + transgenic mice after stroke (Fig. 1D–G).
To examine the progression of microgliosis, we measured the
changes in the volume of reactive microglia within the first week
after ischaemia. We found that the total volume of reactive microglia
increased gradually and reached a peak volume of
4.99 0.44 mm3 on the fourth day after stroke. After that, the
volume of reactive microglia decreased (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Table 1). The area of reactive microglia exhibited a consistent
pattern and could be divided into three zones based on the difference
in cell density and GFP fluorescent intensity: core zone,

accumulation zone, and marginal zone (Fig. 2B). The core zone
was delimited as the ischaemic core region where only sparse reactive
microglia were found in the first few days after ischaemia.
However, more reactive microglia infiltrated the core zone at a
later stage. The accumulation zone was identified as a band
with the highest density and GFP intensity of microglia surrounding
the ischaemic core. Microglia in the accumulation zone had
hypertrophic cell body and lacked ramified processes. The region
between the accumulation zone and outside non-ischaemic area
was the marginal zone, where reactive microglia had fewer short
and stout processes than resting microglia (Fig. 2B).
To investigate the kinetics of microglial activation and expansion,
we measured changes in cell density of reactive microglia in these
three distinct zones and the width of the accumulation zone from
Day 1 to Day 7 after stroke induction. Cell densities in all three zones
increased continuously within the first week after stroke, with the
accumulation zone having the highest cell density and the fastest
growth rate (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with
our findings on the volume changes of reactive microglia, the width
of the accumulation zone broadened continuously during the first 4
days after stroke induction, and then decreased over the subsequent
3 days (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Table 1).
CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating cells
infiltrated into central nervous system
through impaired blood–brain barrier
after stroke
To determine whether circulating cells have the ability to populate
the CNS parenchyma and contribute to microgliosis after ischaemic
stroke, we took advantage of peripheral chimerism with parabionts
to distinguish circulating cells from resident microglia. We
collected brains from wild-type mice of parabiotic pairs from the
Figure 1 Microgliosis after acute stroke. (A) Schematic diagram showing the experimental set-up. Chimerism was established 13–14 days
after parabiotic surgery. Rose bengal photothrombosis was induced in both animals of the parabiotic pairs. In vivo imaging was performed
and brain slices were collected from Day 1 to Day 7 after stroke induction. (B) Representive confocal image of brain sections from healthy

first day to the seventh day after stroke, and sectioned them into
30mm slices on a vibrating microtome. In contrast to studies using
models characterized by a diffuse or focal neurodegeneration in
the absence of BBB dysfunction (Ajami et al., 2007; Mildner et al.,
2007), infiltration of partner-derived CX3CR1GFP/ + cells was readily
identified in the ischaemic area in the ipsilateral hemisphere of
the wild-type mice after stroke (Fig. 3A–F). In vivo two-photon
imaging indicated that CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells were located
in brain parenchyma. There was a significant leakage of plasma
containing Texas Red dextran in the ischaemic area (Fig. 3G),
implying disruption of the BBB in the ischaemic zone. The majority
of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells were located in the accumulation
zone (Fig. 3A–C). However, the density of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells in the accumulation zone of wild-type mice was much
lower than the density of CX3CR1GFP/ + cells in the same region of
their fluorescent partners (43.6 3.5/mm2 for CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells versus 1308.6 40.7/mm2 for microglia at Day 5
after stroke when the infiltrating cells had the highest density,
P = 7.06 1011, Figs 2C and 3H). In addition to inducing ischaemia
in both mice of parabionts, we also induced photothrombosis
only in the wild-type mouse of the parabionts. A similar pattern of
recruitment of CX3CR1GFP/ + cells was observed in the ischaemic
zone of the wild-type mouse (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found
there was no significant difference in the number of CX3CR1GFP/ +
infiltrating cells between parabiotic (GFP) animals in which only
the wild-type mouse or both of the parabionts were subjected to
cerebral ischaemia (1910.3 243.7 cells for ischaemia only in
wild-type mouse versus 1806.6 345.9 cells for ischaemia in
both mice at Day 7 after stroke, P = 0.841). These data suggested
that ischaemia in wild-type mouse alone can mobilize and recruit
partner-derived cells.
We also performed sham-operated controls without stroke induction
in parabionts, and analysed sections spanning 1 to 4
months of parabionts. Consistent with results reported by using
parabiosis (Ajami et al., 2007, 2011) and in contrast to data obtained
by using bone marrow transplantation and irradiation
(Mildner et al., 2007), no GFP-positive cells from their fluorescent
partners were observed in parenchyma of the wild-type mice,
supporting the concept that blood-derived cells don’t cross intact
BBB under physiological conditions. Nevertheless, there were a
small number of GFP-positive perivascular and meningeal cells in
the wild-type mice of the parabionts (Supplementary Fig. 4).
These results are consistent with reports that both perivascular
cells and meningeal macrophages are renewed, to some extent,
by bone marrow-derived cells (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Corti
et al., 2002; Schilling et al., 2003; Hess et al., 2004).

cells. We found that only 36.3 3.0% of the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells were IBA1-positive in wild-type mice (Fig. 3D–F), in
contrast with 97.3 0.5% of GFP-positive cells that were IBA1-
positive in the CX3CR1GFP/ + transgenic partners (Fig. 1E–G). To
further delineate the phenotype of these CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells, brain sections were stained with CCR2 antibody. CCR2 is
reported to express at high levels in inflammatory monocytes
but not in microglia (Mizutani et al., 2012), and is needed for
monocytes to enter into the CNS (Prinz and Priller, 2010; Ajami
et al., 2011). Consistent with these reports, all CX3CR1GFP/ + cells
in CX3CR1GFP/ + mice of parabionts were CCR2 negative (Supplementary
Fig. 5A–C and G–I). Furthermore, although CCR2-positive
cells were found in the ischaemic area of the wild-type mice
(Supplementary Fig. 5D–F and J–L), none of the CCR2-positive
infiltrating cells were CX3CR1GFP/ + positive at both Day 2 (Supplementary
Fig. 5D–F) and Day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 5J–L) after
stroke, suggesting that a different subpopulation of blood-derived
cells infiltrated into the ischaemic area. We quantitated CCR2-
positive cells in wild-type mice of the parabionts following stroke
and found that CCR2-positive cells accounted for 48% of
the infiltrating cells (including both CX3CR1GFP/ +-positive and
CCR2-positive cells).
In addition to phenotypic differences, the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells in wild-type mice also displayed different kinetics
from microglia in their transgenic partners. In contrast with the
continuous increase of microglia in their chimeric partners within
the first week after stroke induction (Fig. 2C), the number of
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells in wild-type mice increased in the
first 5 days after stroke induction and then subsequently decreased
(Fig. 3H and Supplementary Table 1). The most significant increase
in the number of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells was
observed between Day 4 and Day 5 after stroke (Fig. 3H).
These data suggested that CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells derived
from circulation had different dynamics from parenchymal microglia
in response to ischaemic stroke. To investigate the potential
mechanism for the decrease in the number of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells, we assessed the expression of activated caspase-3 in
the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells. We found that 30.0 0.8%
(n = 2) and 22.0 3.0% (n = 4) of the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells were caspase-3 positive at Day 3 and Day 7 after stroke,
respectively (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary Fig. 6A–C), suggesting
that an active apoptotic process may underlie the decline of
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells. We also evaluated apoptosis of
reactive microglia in the CX3CR1GFP/ + mice and found that
28.5 1.1% (n = 2) and 40.0 9.6% (n = 4) of microglia were
caspase-3 positive at Day 3 and Day 7 after stroke, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 6D–I). These data indicated that microgliosis
was a dynamic process involving both microglial proliferation and
apoptosis.
To explore whether the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells can proliferate
after stroke, we evaluated the uptake of BrdU in GFP-
positive cells from brains of wild-type mice of parabionts. After
injections of BrdU for a maximum of 7 days, we detected incorporation
of BrdU in brain sections. However, no BrdU uptake was
found in the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells in brain parenchyma
(n = 8 animals, Fig. 4D–F), suggesting CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells do not undergo cell division. We also monitored the
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells in vivo by two-photon imaging,
and no cell division was observed over 30 h (n = 30 animals,
data not shown). In addition, we found that CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells were hardly observed in the ischaemic zone 3 months
after ischaemia (Supplementary Fig. 7). These data suggested that
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells from circulation were not subject to
proliferation to maintain their self-expansion. We also evaluated
the uptake of BrdU in CCR2-positive but GFP-negative cells in the
ischaemic area, and found no BrdU incorporation in these cells
either. This result indicated that CCR2-positive infiltrating cells
did not undergo active cell division (Supplementary Fig. 8A–D).
Proliferation of local resident cells
rather than recruitment of CX3CR1GFP/ +
circulating cells is the main source of
microgliosis
To investigate whether microglia can self-renew, we evaluated
microglial proliferation by measuring the incorporation of BrdU
in microglia of CX3CR1GFP/ + mice after stroke. BrdU-labelled
microglia (BrdU-positive, GFP-positive) were observed in the
brains of CX3CR1GFP/ + mice after stroke, mostly in the accumulation
zone (Fig. 5A–D). Triple staining of GFP-positive cell with
Hoechst 33258 and BrdU antibodies indicated that most BrdU
signals in GFP-positive cells were located in the nuclei (Supplementary
Fig. 8E–H), suggesting that BrdU signals mainly signify
the mitotic event. Consistent with a continued increase in cell
density of reactive microglia, we found that there was a significant
increase in the frequency of proliferating microglia (BrdU-positive,
GFP-positive) between 3 and 7 days after stroke (20.4 2.2% to
30.3 1.0%, P = 0.003) (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. 8I–P).
These data suggest that resident microglia proliferate and provide
a sustainable source for microgliosis.
To directly monitor the formation of microgliosis, we examined
microglial transformation and proliferation after ischaemic stroke
by taking advantage of two-photon microscopic imaging of GFP-
labelled microglia in living animals. Microglial cells in the ischaemic
area retracted their motile processes gradually within hours, shifting
from ramified to amoeboid morphology (Fig. 5F–I). In line with
our data from BrdU immunohistochemistry, we found that microglia
could undergo active division and we captured the entire process
of microglial proliferation in the accumulation zone of
microgliosis at Day 2 after stroke induction (Fig. 5J–Q and Supplementary
Video 1). Cell division occured in microglia with nearly
spherical shape. The division was symmetric and microglia divided
into two smaller daughter cells. The entire time course of microglial
cell division took 1h.
Discussion
Our data indicate that circulating cells do not enter the CNS under
normal conditions, but they are able to infiltrate the CNS through
compromised BBB induced by ischaemic stroke. These results are
consistent with reports that blood-derived cells are recruited into
the CNS through impaired BBB, but do not have the ability to

populate the CNS with intact BBB (Kennedy and Abkowitz, 1997;
Ajami et al., 2007, 2011; Mildner et al., 2007). In contrast to
previous reports using irradiation and transplantation (Ajami
et al., 2007, 2011; Mildner et al., 2007), the recruitment of
CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating cells in our study occurred without experimental
manipulation of bone marrow or haematopoietic cells,
which may artificially mobilize myeloid precursors or introduce exogenous
haematopoietic stem cells into circulation. We also detected
infiltration of CX3CR1GFP/ + cells in parabionts where only
the wild-type of the pair is lesioned. Thus, infiltration of
CX3CR1GFP/ + cells from circulation was mainly dependent on
the integrity of the BBB. Presumably, blood-derived signalling
may be involved in mobilization and recruitment of CX3CR1GFP/
+ circulating cells. CCR2 has been proposed to regulate the infiltration
of monocytes into the CNS (Prinz and Priller, 2010; Ajami
et al., 2011). However, we found that all the CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells in wild-type mice of the parabionts were CCR2-negative
at both Day 2 and Day 7 after stroke. These results indicated
that CCR2 may not be required for the recruitment of
CX3CR1GFP/ + cells after ischaemia.
Although CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating cells infiltrated parenchyma,
they neither proliferate nor differentiate into microglia.
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells are eventually lost in the ischaemic
area. These findings suggest that infiltration of CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating
cells and proliferation of parenchymal microglia were two
independent events under ischaemic stroke. Our data indicated
that expansion of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells and reactive
microglia had different kinetics. The number of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells peaked on Day 5 after stroke and then decreased.
Caspase-3 staining suggests that an active apoptotic process
contributed to the decline of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells. In
addition, it is possible that the recovery of BBB may also limit
the infiltration of circulating cells into brain parenchyma.
In contrast, reactive microglia increased continuously during the
first week after stroke induction. Importantly, the number of
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells in wild-type mice was much less
than the number of reactive microglia in their CX3CR1GFP/ + partners.
Although the actual number of CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells
derived from circulation to the CNS could be more than twice the
number we showed considering the limitation of the parabiotic
model (Ransohoff, 2007; Soulet and Rivest, 2008), we do not
expect that those uncounted cells can reconcile the large difference
(30-fold) in density between these two cell populations. In
addition, the distinction between the two cell populations was also
evident in their immunological profile. Less than 40% of
CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating cells expressed IBA1, whereas 497%
of CX3CR1GFP/ + cells involved in microgliosis were IBA1-positive.
A small percentage of IBA1-negative cells in CX3CR1GFP/ + mice of
the parabionts may represent GFP-positive infiltrating cells from
their own circulation. Taken together, our observations imply
that, although CX3CR1GFP/ + circulating cells infiltrated CNS
parenchyma after ischaemic stroke, these infiltrating cells did not
proliferate and were different from resident microglia.
Consistent with several other studies, another major conclusion
from this study was that microglial expansion at the lesion site was
mainly dependent on the proliferation of CNS resident cells
(Ladeby et al., 2005; Solomon et al., 2006; Ajami et al., 2007,
2011; Denes et al., 2007). Our data of BrdU-staining indicated
that microglia can proliferate and we observed that 20–30% of
reactive microglia were BrdU-positive. Although we cannot rule

out the possibility that activated microglia could engulf apoptotic
or dead cells with BrdU-positive signals, our data indicated that
most BrdU signals in the microglia were located in the nuclei
(Supplementary Fig. 9A–D), and we do not expect a significant
overestimation of mitotic events. The proliferation ratio may be
even underestimated considering the low dose of BrdU (100 mg/
kg for 1 day), which may be insufficient to label all of proliferative
cells (Taupin, 2007). Two-photon imaging indicated that activated
microglia can undergo drastic morphological alteration in response
to ischaemia and divide into two daughter cells within hours. The
most significant increase in cell number occurred in the accumulation
zone, a penumbral region that may still have partial blood
flow. It remains to be determined what factors may contribute to
the rapid activation and expansion of microglia in this narrow
band of microgliosis. Although our photothrombosis model indicated
that resident microglia were the main source of microgliosis
after stroke, we do not rule out the possibility that circulating cells
might develop to functional microglia in other pathological conditions
(Priller et al., 2001; Simard and Rivest, 2004; Soulet and
Rivest, 2008). Experimental manipulation such as irradiation or
transplantation of exogenous bone marrow cells may lead to artificial
persistence of haematopoietic stem cells in the circulation
that may infiltrate the CNS and differentiate into microglia
(Kennedy and Abkowitz, 1997; Ajami et al., 2007, 2011;
Ransohoff, 2007).
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that a small population of
CX3CR1GFP/ + cells were recruited from circulation into the CNS
after ischaemic stroke. These infiltrating cells displayed distinct
properties from resident microglia and did not proliferate.
Further studies are warranted to identify the precise cell lineage
and function of these blood-derived cells. We also examined in
detail the response of reactive microglia and directly imaged the
time course of microglial transformation and proliferation in vivo.
Our data suggest that cells involved in the process of microgliosis
in the subacute phase of ischaemic stroke were mainly derived
from local expansion of resident microglia. CX3CR1GFP/ + infiltrating
cells and reactive microglia had different expansion kinetics
and properties in response to ischaemic stroke and they may represent
two distinct populations of cells with different functions and
therapeutic potentials for the treatment of stroke.
