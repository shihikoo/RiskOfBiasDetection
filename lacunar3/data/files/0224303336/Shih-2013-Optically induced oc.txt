Protocol
Optically Induced Occlusion of Single Blood Vessels
in Rodent Neocortex
Andy Y. Shih, Nozomi Nishimura, John Nguyen, Beth Friedman, Patrick D. Lyden,
Chris B. Schaffer, and David Kleinfeld
The ability to form targeted vascular occlusions in small vessels of the brain is an important technique
for studying the microscopic basis of cerebral ischemia. We describe two complementary methods that
enable targeted occlusion of any single blood vessel within the upper 500 µm of adult rodent neocortex.
Our goal is to generate highly localized regions of ischemia by blocking penetrating arterioles and
ascending venules, which are bottlenecks offlow in the cortical angioarchitecture. One method, termed
photothrombosis, makes use of linear optical absorption by a photosensitizer, transiently circulated in
the blood stream, to induce a clot in a surface or near-surface segment of a vessel. The second method,
termed plasma-mediated ablation, makes use of nonlinear optical interactions, without the need to
introduce an exogenous absorber, to induce clots in subsurface segments of penetrating vessels, as well
as subsurface microvessels and capillaries. The choice of the method for occlusion of individual vessels
depends on the location of the vessels being studied and the objectives of the study. Here we describe
concurrent high resolution in vivo imaging and auxiliary laser setups, occlusion protocols, and post
hoc histological procedures.

Objective lenses
For low magnification, use a 4×, 0.28 NA objective (UB950; Olympus) or a 10×, 0.3 NA objective (W Achroplan;
Zeiss). For high resolution, use a 40×, 0.8 NA objective (UM568; Olympus).
Two-photon laser-scanning microscope
We integrate additional lasers into a custom-built two-photon imaging system for photothrombosis and plasmamediated
ablation (Fig. 1A; Majewska et al. 2000; Tsai and Kleinfeld 2009). Additionally, Sigler et al. (2008) have
described methods to convert an Olympus BX series microscope for photothrombosis of single vessels. These and
other schemes that combine imaging and ablation beams before the scan mirrors may be adapted for a commercial
instrument, the Ultima Multiphoton Microscopy System with an optional high-speed two-photon optics
set and external detector (Prairie Technologies).
METHOD
1. Prepare a cranial imaging window in an experimental rodent of choice.
Detailed procedures for animal preparation and the generation of a cranial imaging window in the rat are
presented in Kleinfeld and Delaney (1996), Kleinfeld and Denk (2000), and Kleinfeld et al. (2008). The
approaches described in this protocol can also be applied to mice, and details of mouse cranial window
preparations can be found in Xu et al. (2007), Holtmaat et al. (2009), and Drew et al. (2010).
Photothrombotic Occlusion
Targeted photothrombosis can be used to occlude individual arterioles and venules that lie on or near the cortical
surface.
2. Inject a 1.0 mL/kg bolus of 5% fluorescein–dextran solution in saline into either a femoral vein
catheter or directly into a tail vein.
Labeling the blood plasma with 2-MDa fluorescein–dextran provides contrast between the red blood cells
(RBCs) and the plasma (Kleinfeld et al. 1998). The high-molecular-weight dextran provides stable labeling,
typically for at least 3 h. Supplement the dye at 0.3 mL/kg, as needed during imaging.
3. Obtain a three-dimensional stack of images of the cerebral vessels throughout the cranial window
to use as a navigational map (Fig. 1B). Start at low magnification, typically with a 4×, 0.28 NA
objective or a 10×, 0.3 NA objective.
Higher resolution imaging of local vascular architecture and vasodynamics, such as RBC speed and vessel
diameter (Shih et al. 2009), are typically obtained with a 40×, 0.8 NA objective.
4. Select a penetrating arteriole or ascending venule to target for occlusion (Fig. 1C). Targeting
vessels that have a segment coursing parallel to the cortical surface allows for easy verification of
clot formation.
Note that cortical arterioles appear smoother and straighter than venules and have fewer branching points.
The location of penetrating arterioles and ascending venules can be identified by manually tracing through
the pial arterial and venous networks (Fig. 1B). Arterioles and venules can also be differentiated based on
direction of flow (i.e., into or out of the cortex).
5. Inject a 1.0 mL/kg bolus of 1% (w/v) Rose Bengal solution in saline through the femoral vein
catheter or tail vein.
Rose Bengal should be injected immediately before forming the occlusion, since it is cleared from the blood
stream within minutes (Zhang et al. 2005).
6. Initiate photothrombosis by aiming the focal point of the green laser within the lumen of the
target vessel, near the vessel wall (Fig. 1D). This will nucleate the clotting cascade and create an
attachment point for the growing clot. If a clot does not occur within 5–10 sec of irradiation,
inject a 0.5 mL/kg supplement of Rose Bengal solution.
A 50-mW green laser light (Edmund Optics) is introduced into the imaging beam path with dichroic mirror 1
(625 DRLP, Chroma) (Fig. 1A). The focal point of the beam is fixed, centered along the optical axis, and
controlled by a shutter (LS3Z2 Uniblitz and VMM-D1 driver, Vincent). The beam is adjusted to pass through
a 3.5-mm-diameter clearing that was etched in the dielectric coating of dichroic mirror 2 (700 DCXRU,
Chroma) (Fig. 1A). This allows transmission of the green laser while still reflecting >90% of emitted light
from the sample toward the PMTs. As the interval of irradiation is typically long (i.e., 50–100 sec), irradiation

is periodically interrupted for brief epochs of imaging, typically 1 frame (0.2 sec per frame) every 1 sec for an
80% duty cycle. This permits formation of the clot to be observed in real time. Alternatively, the PMT
assembly can be temporarily moved out of the path to allow the green laser light to pass. However,
observation of the formation of the clot is recommended to avoid excessive irradiation and unintended
photothrombosis in neighboring vessels. The green laser is brought to the same focal plane as the imaging
beam of the two-photon microscope using an appropriate telescope and centered in the imaging field.
When using a 40×, 0.8 NA dipping objective with an underfilled back aperture, the final green laser spot size
is3 µm in diameter. In all cases, the intensity of the laser light at the focus should initially be adjusted to1
mW using a tunable neutral density filter and may be increased as needed. The motorized/encoding x−y
stage of the microscope is used to reposition the animal to change the location of photoactivation (Fig. 1A).
Alternatively, additional lasers may be introduced through a second set of scanners so that the position of
irradiation may be shifted electromechanically (i.e., the Ultima with an optional second set of scanners).
7. Traverse the focus of the green laser across the diameter of the blood vessel to facilitate thrombus
formation. Occlusion may require 10–100 sec of irradiation. Larger vessels with relatively fast
RBC flow require more time to fully occlude; the exact time must be determined empirically. A
successful occlusion appears densely packed with immobile nonfluorescent RBCs often surrounded
by a brighter region of stagnant fluorescent plasma (Fig. 1D).
8. Collect postocclusion measurements, as desired.
Plasma-Mediated Occlusion
Plasma-mediated ablation makes use of the dissociation of matter by high fluence, 100 to 300-fsec pulses of nearinfrared
light (Schaffer et al. 2001; Tsai et al. 2004, 2009). These pulses ionize the material, such as blood plasma or
vascular endothelium, within a femtoliter-sized focal volume of the incident laser pulse. This method allows occlusions
of microvessels and capillaries deep below the surface of the cortex, typically down to 500 µm, but in principle down
to 1000 µm below the pia, without disruption of the neighboring tissue. Plasma-mediated ablation is also well suited for
inducing clots in penetrating arterioles and ascending venules, by targeting subsurface segments of the vascular tree.
However, this method is not suitable for targeting arterioles that lie on the cortical surface, which tend to hemorrhage
and obscure subsequent imaging.
9. Collect baseline vascular image stacks. To resolve deep microvessels, this should be performed at
high resolution using a 40× objective.
10. Select a subsurface segment of vasculature for targeted occlusion. This could be penetrating
arterioles, ascending venules, or subsurface microvessels.
To occlude Penetrating Arterioles and Ascending Venules
11. Place the focus of the amplified beam about halfway between the brain surface and the first
capillary branch off of the vessel (Fig. 1E). The laser focus should be located within the vessel
lumen a few micrometers from the vessel wall.
12. Irradiate with one pulse using an energy that is below the expected damage threshold. This
starting energy is depth dependent (i.e.,50 nJ at 20 µm depth and 150 nJ at 150 µm depth).
An amplified 100-fsec light source is introduced into the beam path through a polarizing beam splitter
(Fig. 1A). As with the case of green laser light, it may also be introduced in other locations along the path of
the imaging beam. This beam is focused to the same plane as the imaging laser and aligned such that
photodisruption occurs at the center of the imaged field. The energy per pulse of the photodisruption beam
is coarsely varied with a tunable neutral density filter and finely varied with a λ/2 plate followed by a
polarizing beam splitter. The number of pulses is controlled by a fast shutter (LS3Z2 Uniblitz and VMMD1
driver). The diameter of the amplified beam is adjusted with an appropriate telescope to overfill the back
aperture of the objective. This is necessary to obtain the smallest possible spot size for the amplified beam,
which is on the order of a femtoliter. The energy per pulse is initially set to 30 nJ at the focus of a 40×, 0.8 NA
dipping objective, which is near the threshold fluence for damage of 1 J/cm2. For a 5-kHz, 100-fsec
amplified laser, this corresponds to an average power of 0.15 mW.
13. Increase the number of pulses by factors of 10 with the same energy, often trying each pulse number
a few times while watching for signs of laser damage. Thefirst visual indication of photodisruption
is extravasation offluorescein–dextran outside the vessel lumen (Fig. 1E). If extravasation fails to
occur, increase the pulse energy by25% and repeat the procedure described above.

14. Once extravasation occurs, repeat the irradiation with the threshold energy and number of pulses,
while targeting multiple nearby areas along the inner wall of the vessel segment.
15. Continue to irradiate the targeted segment until there is a complete cessation of RBC movement
in the target vessel. To verify successful occlusion, return to the cortical surface and ensure that
flow has ceased in the main branch of the arteriole or venule.
Increasing the energy too high results in the rupture of the vessel and a large hemorrhage (Nishimura et al.
2006).
To Occlude Subsurface Microvessels
16. Aim the focal point of the amplified beam into the vessel lumen, a few micrometers away from the
vessel wall (Fig. 1F). Use a graded approach to irradiation similar to that described above. It is
critical to identify a segment of the targeted vessel where RBC movement can be readily visualized
to confirm successful occlusion.
Histology
It is often desirable to examine the consequences of single-vessel occlusion using post hoc histology. A number of
strategies can be used to relocate the occluded vessel and the corresponding cyst in perfused tissue (Fig. 2A–C). A
fluorescent vascular casting method can be used to visualize the pial vasculature during histological processing.
17. Inject afluorescein–dextran–agarose mixture transcardially as described in Tsai et al. (2005) and
Shih et al. (2009).

18. Because this dye remains in situ after tissue fixation, use it to map the exact location of the
targeted vessel, based on unique features in the pial vascular topology that are visible through the
imaging window.
19. Excise the region of interest in a coronal orientation using a brain matrix.
20. Cryoprotect the blocked tissue in 30% sucrose overnight and further cryosection it for
immunohistology.
The microinfarction can also be viewed in a flattened cortex preparation that is cryosectioned tangentially to
the cortical surface.
21. View the microinfarction in a flattened cortex preparation after fluorescent casting of the vasculature
(Fig. 2B). Excise the cortex, sandwich it between two glass slides separated by a distance
of 2.5 mm, and postfix it overnight.
22. Locate the target vessel and then generate fiducial marks in its vicinity by applying current
through fine tungsten electrodes that are advanced through the thickness of the cortex. This
creates burn marks in each section that are used for alignment of serial tissue sections after
cryosectioning tangentially to the cortical surface.
DISCUSSION
Advances in imaging techniques, such as two-photon laser scanning microscopy, combined with
various methods to label and record cellular activity in vivo, have greatly improved both spatial
and temporal resolution for studying pathological processes in real time (Misgeld and Kerschensteiner
2006). These methods are important for the study of pathological mechanisms that underlie ischemic
injury, including abnormal changes in cell signaling and structure, vascular dysfunction, and
inflammation.
Here we consider two complementary approaches to selectively occlude single vessels anywhere
within the upper 500 µm of cerebral cortex. Photothrombosis uses linear optical absorption by a
photosensitizer, transiently circulating in the blood stream, to initiate a clotting cascade in vessels on
the cortical surface (Watson et al. 1985; Schaffer et al. 2006; Nishimura et al. 2007; Sigler et al. 2008).
Plasma-mediated ablation makes use of nonlinear optical interactions, without the need to introduce
an exogenous absorber, to induce clots in subsurface vessels and capillaries (Nishimura et al. 2006,
2010; Nguyen et al. 2007). Both techniques complement an existing variety of preclinical stroke
models that generate larger areas of ischemia (Ginsberg and Busto 1989). The advantages of this
targeted approach include the ability to (1) select a specific class of cortical vessel (i.e., capillary vs.
surface arteriole or venule); (2) select a specific location for ischemia within the imaging window (i.e.,
a cortical column); (3) make pre- and postmeasurements of hemodynamic and neuronal state variables
; and (4) initiate the ischemic event in situ under the microscope.
Our goal is to exploit the physical localization of highly focused laser light to form occlusions
within “bottleneck” vessels of the cortical angioarchitecture. Occlusions of either penetrating arterioles
(Nishimura et al. 2007) or ascending venules (Nguyen et al. 2007) have a large impact on cortical
bloodflow. Furthermore, the columnar regions of ischemia generated by such occlusion are capable of
developing into cortical microinfarctions over several days.
Example Application
Both of the techniques described here are appropriate for chronic as well as acute studies. An example
longitudinal study shows that occlusion of even a single penetrating arteriole leads to discrete regions
of cortical ischemia and tissue damage (Fig. 2B,C; see Blinder et al. 2010). The accuracy in this
technique allows one to investigate the functional consequences of ischemia on cells neighboring
the targeted vessel, by, for example, using mice with genetically labeled cell populations (Feng et al.
2000) or after loading tissue with organic Ca2+ dyes (Stosiek et al. 2003; Ding et al. 2009). Further-

more, these occlusions provide a means to model and study the consequences of vascular disease and
small-scale strokes that occur in the aging human cortex (Suter et al. 2002; Kovari et al. 2004).
Although the examples described here are from the rat, it is anticipated that future studies will take
advantage of various genetically engineered mouse lines, which appear to be particularly amenable to
longitudinal imaging after photothrombosis (Brown et al. 2007; Drew et al. 2010).
Limitations
Two caveats of photothrombosis are noteworthy. First, small thrombi formed during the period of
illumination may travel downstream rather than stick at the site of irradiation. It is difficult to track
the location and stability of these unintentional thrombi, and thus their impact on blood flow is
unknown. Second, even well-formed clots tend to dislodge or disintegrate over the long term, particularly
in fast-flowing arterioles. Although most clots are stable for at least 5–6 h, over the course of a
typical experiment, the exact timing of natural deocclusion can vary greatly from vessel to vessel. Thus,
the effects of reperfusion injury would be difficult to assess in this model. However, future approaches
may be able to improve control over recanalization by irradiating the clot with ultraviolet light
(Watson et al. 2002). Lastly, one caveat of the plasma-mediated ablation method is that excessive
damage to the vessel wall is likely to cause hemorrhaging.
