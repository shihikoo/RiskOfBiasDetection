Background and Purpose—Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death worldwide but lacks viable treatment or treatment
targets. Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF) is a small heat-stable pentapeptide produced by Entamoeba
histolytica in axenic culture, which is supposed to protect the brain from ischemic injury; the mechanism, however,
remains unknown. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism underlying the protective role of MLIF in
brain ischemia.
Methods—A middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats was used for detecting the effect of MLIF in the brain ischemia
in vivo. To identify targets of MLIF in brain endothelial cells, we performed immunoprecipitation of biotin-conjugated
MLIF and mass spectrometry.
Results—MLIF can protect the brain from ischemic injury in vivo, yielding decreased ischemic volume, prolonged
survival, and improved neurological outcome. In vitro studies showed that MLIF displayed protective effects through
inhibition of expression of pathological inflammatory adhesion molecules and enhancing endothelial nitric oxide
synthase expression and nitric oxide release in the cerebrovascular endothelium. The target screening experiments
demonstrated binding of MLIF to the ribosomal protein translation elongation factor eEF1A1. MLIF enhanced
endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression through stabilization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA, and
eEF1A1 was shown to be necessary for this enhanced expression. Knockdown of eEF1A1 or inhibition of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase attenuated MLIF-mediated inhibition of adhesion molecule expression.
Conclusions—In this study, we identified a new potential pharmacologically targetable mechanism underlying MLIF’s protective
effects in brain ischemia through the eEF1A1/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway. (Stroke. 2012;43:2764-2773.)

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized
countries and the third common cause of death in China.
Stroke is also the most frequent cause of permanent disability
in adults worldwide. Many medical conditions can be the risk
factors of stroke, including high blood pressure, high blood
cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Among all
types of stroke, 80% are ischemic.1 The most common
cause of ischemic stroke is the sudden occlusion of a blood
vessel by a thrombus or embolism, resulting in an almost
immediate loss of oxygen and glucose to the cerebral tissue.2
Although different mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis
of stroke, increasing evidence shows that ischemic injury
and inflammation account for its pathogenic progression.3,4
In the response of the ischemic/reperfusion injury, increase
in oxygen-free radicals and cytokines in the cerebral tissue
is induced, and consequently, the expression of adhesion
molecules on the endothelial cell surface is induced,
including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and selectins,
which mediate adhesion of leukocytes to endothelia in the
periphery of the infarct and trigger the inflammatory
cascade to cerebral damage.5–9

Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF), a heatstable
pentapeptide (Met-Gln-Cys-Asn-Ser) produced by
Entamoeba histolytic in axenic culture, is first found to be an
anti-inflammatory functional peptide.10 MLIF can inhibit the
locomotion of human monocytes in vivo. The synthetic MLIF
had the same anti-inflammatory features as the native MLIF in
inhibition of the locomotion of human microparticles, and of the
respiratory burst in human microparticles and neutrophil polymorphonuclear
leukocyte, and depression of delayed hypersensitivity
skin reactions to DNCB in guinea pigs. It is also reported
that MLIF can inhibit the expression of interleukin-1,
interferon-, interleukin-5, and interleukin-6 and increase the
expression of interleukin-10 in macrophages.11–16
The anti-inflammatory effect of MLIF led us to the initial
interest to test whether it can act inflammatory response in
brain ischemia. We17 and other laboratories18 have found
MLIF can remarkably protect brain ischemic injury with
decreased ischemic volume changes. In this study, we explored
a further study that made a deep evaluation on its
therapeutic window and prognosis on the multiple administrations.
We found MLIF can protect acute brain ischemia
with administration of MLIF within 1 hour after occlusion in
a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The in
vitro studies showed that the protective roles of MLIF on
cerebrovascular endothelial cells through inhibiting oxidized
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and hypoxia induced ICAM-1
and VCAM-1 expression, at the same time as enhancing
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and
nitric oxide releasing. These phenotypes of protective roles
further led us to use a pulldown assay and biological mass
spectrum identification to explore the target of MLIF, in
which we confirmed MLIF binds to the ribosomal protein
translation elongation factor eEF1A1. Targeting eEF1A1 and
thus enhancing eNOS expression contribute to the protective
action of MLIF in cerebrovascular endothelium. The eEF1A1
knockdown or eNOS inhibition both attenuated the inhibitory
the effect of MLIF on oxidized LDL-induced adhesion
molecule expression. Therefore, our finding may present a
new therapeutic drug candidate for targeting the eEF1A1/
eNOS pathway and protecting cerebrovascular endothelium
injury from brain ischemia.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Reagents
Male Sprague-Dawley rats provided by the Shanghai Experimental
Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
were housed in controlled conditions and received a standard rat
chow and tap water ad libitum. All the animals used in this work
received humane care in compliance with institutional animal care
guidelines, and the research protocol was approved by the Local
Institutional Committee. MLIF and biotinylating MLIF were synthesized
by the Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China). Anti-
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, eNOS, and antirabbit phycoerythrin antibodies
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA),
antibody for rabbit eEF1A was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology Biotechnology (CST, Danvers, MA), antibody for
FLAG was purchased from Abmart (Arlington, MA), and secondary
antibodies were purchased from Kangchen (Shanghai, China).
Cell Culture
Mouse microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3), THP1 cells, and
AD293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). All the cells were cultured in endotoxinfree
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal calf serum
(PAA Laboratories GmbH).
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Male Wistar rats received MCAO operation. The MCAO Ischemia
was induced by placing an 11-mm silicone-coated 8-0 filament from
the left common carotid artery into the internal carotid artery for 2
hours. After 24 hours, we evaluated the neurological deficit score
based on the detection of hemi paresis and abnormal posture. After
operation, the infarct size was measured by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride staining assay. Brain slices were scanned and the
areas were determined by planimetry of computer images (Image-
Pro plus 6.0; Bethesda, MD). The ischemic percentage was calculated
by the necrotic brain weight than the whole brain.
Western Blotting
Cells were lysed with M-PER Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail; protein
concentrations of the extracts were measured with BCA assay
(Pierce) and equalized with the extraction reagent. An equal amount
of the extracts was analyzed in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
for blotting with antibodies. Relative protein levels were
normalized with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
gray value in Western blot.
Immunoprecipitation
The lysate of bEnd.3 cells was stirred calmly with biotinylating
MLIF (bio-MLIF) and 20 L streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen) at
4°C for approximately 40 minutes to capture binding proteins. The
streptavidin-agarose was completely removed by centrifugation in a
microcentrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 1 minute. The agarose was washed
4 times. The washed agarose was then resuspended in a 20-L
sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer solution to elute the bound
proteins. The supernatant was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie brilliant
blue staining. Each protein studied in this study was analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(Voyager DESTR mass spectrometer, Applied Biosystems)
after in-gel digestion, and protein identification searches were
performed by the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science).19
Expression of FLAG Tagged Proteins
The full length eEF1A1 and its domains were amplified by
polymerase chain reaction and cloned in pcDNA3.1(-) vector
(Invitrogen). AD293 cells were transfected with FLAG-eEF1A1,
FLAG-eEF1A1-D1, FLAG-eEF1A1-D2FLAG-eEF1A1-D3,
FLAG-eEF1A1-D1D2, or FLAG-eEF1A1-D2D3 plasmids, respectively.
The extracts from cultured AD293 cells were immunoblotted
with FLAG antibody.
Confocal Microscopy
The bEnd.3 cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Slides loaded with antibody-stained cells were added
FITC-MLIF and viewed with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. The
images were acquired using the LAS-AF software (Leica).
Assay of Luciferase Reporter Gene Expression
Fire luciferase cDNA fused with eNOS mRNA 3-UTR (420nt,
3906–4325) was cloned in pGL3 vector. AD293 cells were cotransfected
with the mixture of indicated luciferase reporter plasmid,
pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase plasmid, and indicated pGL3-eNOSUTR
plasmid. After 24 hours, luciferase activity in the cells was
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega
) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are normalized
for transfection efficiency by dividing Firefly luciferase
activity with that of Renilla luciferase.

Nitric Oxide Production Measurement
To assess nitric oxide (NO) production, we measured the final stable
productions of NO metabolism, nitrite (NO
2
), and nitrate (NO
3
)
based on the Griess reaction. The bEnd.3 cell supernatant (100 mL)
was mixed with 100 mL Griess reagent (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The
absorbance of the reaction product was determined at 540 nm and the
total nitrite concentration was calculated from a standard curve
derived from the reaction of NaNO
2
under assay conditions.
Suppression by RNAi
The following small interfering RNA (siRNA) for eEF1A1 siRNA
were obtained from Invitrogen. (eEF1A1-siRNA: 5-GCA CCA
UGAAGC UUU GAG UGA AGC T-3 eEF1A1-siRNA-A; 5-GUG
CUA ACA UGC CUU GGU UCAAGG G-3 eEF1A1-siRNA-B;

GAG ACG CAG G-3) The bEnd.3 cells were transfected with each
siRNA or control siRNA (20 nmol/L) by using the HiPerFect
Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Shanghai, China). After 2 days of
transfection, cells were lysed. The knockdown effect of eEF1A1 was
analyzed by Western blot.
Monocyte Adhesion
To test effects of MLIF on adhesion of monocytes to endothelial
cells, bEnd.3 cells were grown to confluence on 96-well culture
plates and then treated with oxidized LDL before the adhesion
assays. Ten minutes before the adhesion assay, endothelial cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cultured THP-1, a human
monocyte cell line, were washed and diluted to a final concentration
of 106 cells/mL. THP-1 cells were added to each well of endothelial
cells and were allowed to coincubate with the endothelial monolayer
for 1 hour. Each well was turned appropriate degrees at 15 minutes
to allow uniform distribution of the THP-1 cells across to the
endothelial monolayer. No adherent mononuclear cells were carefully
removed by 2 washes with preheated phosphate-buffered
saline. Adherent cells were counted by microscopy using a
computer-aided image analysis system (ImageAnalyst; Automatix
Corp, Billerica, MA). The adhesion rate was calculated by adherent
mononuclear cells than the whole mononuclear cells.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined by Student t test with a value
of P0.05 considered to be statistically significant (*P0.05;
**P0.01).

gation on the role of MLIF in brain ischemic injury condition.
In this model, brain transient ischemia was induced by
placing an 11-mm silicone-coated 8-0 filament into the
internal carotid artery for 2 hours from the left common
carotid artery in male Sprague-Dawley rats. As shown in
Figure 1A, we first evaluated effect of MLIF at difference
time courses, in which 1 mg/kg MLIF or control saline was
injected intravenously at indicated time after occlusion.
Among 114 rats successfully induced to be brain ischemia,
we found that administration of MLIF at 30 or 60 minutes
after occlusion can significantly reduce brain infarct volume
in the MCAO rat (Figure 1A). Then, we chose 30 minutes
after occlusion to treat the MCAO rats with MLIF injection at
different dosages with evaluation of infarct volume and
neurological behavior. The results showed that 1 mg/kg
MLIF can significantly protect brain ischemic injury with
decreased infarct volume and improved neurological behavior
(Figure 1B). These data strongly suggested the therapy
effect of MLIF for acute brain ischemia in this MCAO model.
To investigate the long-term effect of MLIF, we administered
MLIF for MCAO rats at 4 multiple treatment time
points at 0, 4, 24, and 48 hours after occlusion and then
monitored their survival for 14 days. Although the survival
rate did not exert a significant difference, the median survival
time was prolonged in the MLIF treatment group. As shown
in online-only Supplement Data Figure I, the median survival
time of the control MCAO group was 4 days, but in the MLIF
treatment group, the median survival time extended to 10
days. Importantly, the neurological behavior was significantly
improved by MLIF multiple treatments at 14 days
(online-only Data Supplement Figure I). Taken together, our
results in the rat MCAO model suggested the in vivo
protective roles of MLIF in brain ischemic injury with the
released symptoms on ischemic volume and concomitant
neurological deficit changes.
MLIF Attenuates an Inflammatory Process by
Inhibiting Adhesion Molecule Expression in Brain
Microvascular Endothelial Cells
The brain microvascular endothelial cell-derived adhesion
molecule expression, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, has
been identified to be the pivotal inflammatory marker and

mononuclear cells were removed, and adherent cells were counted by microscopy using a computer-aided image analysis

important therapeutic target for brain ischemia. Adhesion
molecules express in the endothelium at the initial ischemic
injury with hypoxic condition or active substance induction
such as oxidized LDL and mediate infiltration of leukocytes
into brain parenchyma, which crucially aggravate the inflammatory
process. Because MLIF was found to be an antiinflammatory
peptide, we first investigate whether MLIFs
protect brain ischemia through inhibition of an inflammatory
response. To test this function, we homogenized the ischemic
brain from MCAO rats like in Figure 1B and determined the
protein expression level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the
cortical extracts. As shown in Figure 2A, 1 mg/kg MLIF
greatly inhibits the expression of these adhesion molecules,
which indicated a direct anti-inflammatory role of MLIF for
brain ischemia.
To further evaluate the mechanism of MLIF in the brain
vascular endothelium to confirm its regulatory effect on
adhesion molecules, we determined the effect of MLIF on
oxidized LDL or hypoxia-induced adhesion molecule expressions
in a brain microvascular endothelial cell line, bEnd.3
cells. As shown in Figure 2B, the oxidized LDL-induced
ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 can be significantly inhibited by MLIF
in dose-dependent manner, which is confirmed by Western
blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction in protein and mRNA level separately. To mimic
brain ischemic condition, we also treated bEnd.3 cells with a
hypoxia condition. Consistently, the hypoxia-induced
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions can be remarkably inhibited
by MLIF in dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C).
These adhesion molecules derived from brain endothelial
cells can mediate infiltration of leukocytes into the brain and
initiate the brain inflammation. Therefore, we further countered
the adhesion rate of monocyte THP-1 cells to the
bEnd.3 cell-formed cultured endothelium. As shown in Figure
2D, the increased adhesion rate after bEnd.3 cells induced
by oxidized LDL was significantly inhibited by MLIF, which
is consistent with the regulatory ability of MLIF on adhesion
molecule expressions. These findings suggested MLIF can
attenuate the inflammatory process in brain endothelium
through inhibition of adhesion molecules in brain vascular
endothelial cells.
MLIF Binds to eEF1A1 in Brain Microvascular
Endothelial Cells
The remarkable protective effect of MLIF for brain ischemic
injury and the anti-inflammatory role of MLIF for brain
vascular endothelium led us to further explore the possible
pharmacodynamic target. We first synthesized the biotin-

of the target proteins of MLIF in brain vascular endothelial cells. Pulldown reactions were carried out using biotin-conjugated MLIF (bio-
MLIF) peptide and lysate of bEnd.3 cells (A). Protein bound to bio-MLIF was washed 4 times and separated on SDS-PAGE (B). Most of
the proteins that bind specifically are captured (show in IP1), and unbound proteins had been removed by a series of washing steps
(show in IP2–5). Then, the bound proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS after in-gel digestion (n3) to be eEF1A1. D, eEF1A1
binding to bio-MLIF was confirmed to be eEF1A1 by immunoblotting with antieEF1A1 antibody. MLIF indicates monocyte locomotion
inhibitory factor; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption
/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

conjugated MLIF peptide (bio-MLIF) to interact with the cell
lysate of the brain microvascular endothelial bEnd.3 cells.
Then we used the streptavidin-agarose beads to capture the
MLIF-binding proteins. We used a serial affinity purification
to eliminate the circumstance interference. The streptavidinagarose
was first mixed with protein exact, and then supernatant
was transferred to a tube mixed with the same amount
of streptavidin-agarose, and so on. Therefore, most of the
target proteins were captured by the first IP1 mixture, and
little of the target proteins was captured by the following
mixtures (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, the binding
band at near 50 kDa emerged in MLIF-binding IP1 mixture
and was decreased in the following IP mixtures. After in-gel
digestion, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight
mass spectrometry identification, and MASCOT search
engine database analysis, the 50-kDa protein was identified to
be the ribosomal protein translation elongation factor
eEF1A1 (Figure 3C). Then, we transferred the IP samples to
the membrane to make Western blot confirmation by
antieEF1A1 antibody. As shown in Figure 3D, the 50 kDa
protein band was identified to be eEF1A1 in Western blot,
which confirmed the binding of MLIF with eEF1A1.
There are 3 functional domains in eEF1A1 protein including
domain I, domain II, and domain III. To better understand
the molecular mechanism, we further localized the MLIF-
binding site in eEF1A1 protein by pulldown assay of bio-
MLIF and FLAG fusion proteins bearing the full-length
eEF1A1and different domains (Figure 4A). The bio-MLIF
has been shown to bind specifically to eEF1A1 and domain I
(Figure 4B). To confirm the binding of MLIF with eEF1A1,
we also explored immunostaining by using the rabbit
antieEF1A1 and antirabbit phycoerythrin antibodies. As
shown in Figure 4C, the colocalization of fluorescein
isothiocyanate-MLIF with eEF1A1 detected by confocal
microscope strongly suggested that MLIF directly targets
eEF1A1. After transfection with FLAG-eEF1A1 plasmid and
stained with anti-FLAG phycoerythrin antibodies, we also
confirmed the colocalization of MLIF and recombination
eEF1A1 and domain I of eEF1A1. These data suggested
domain I of eEF1A1 is the binding target of eEF1A1.
Interactions With eEF1A1 Contributes to eNOS
Upregulation by MLIF
After confirmation of the interaction of MLIF with eEF1A1,
we next identified the target function of eEF1A1 for the
cerebrovascular system, because it is not well investigated.
Fortunately, one recent report demonstrated that eEF1A1
mediates tumor necrosis factor--induced decrease in eNOS
mRNA stability through binding of eNOS 3-UTR.20 Thus,
we investigated whether MLIF protects brain ischemic injury
through the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway. We first determined the
effect of MLIF for eNOS mRNA stability by using the
luciferase reporter system encoded with eNOS 3-UTR sequence.
As shown in Figure 5A, MLIF can dose-dependently
promote stability of eNOS 3-UTR. To confirm the regulation
in protein level, we also determined eNOS level in endothelial
cells treated by MLIF. As shown in Figure 5B, in cultured
brain vascular endothelial cells as well as the cortical extracts
from MCAO rats, MLIF can directly enhance eNOS expression
level in a dose-dependent manner.
In the stress condition such as oxidized LDL stimulation or
hypoxia, endothelium-derived eNOS expression is often injured
which initiates vascular inflammation with endothelial
dysfunction. Therefore, we tested the effect of MLIF on the
regulation of eNOS in hypoxia and oxidized LDL-treated
endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 5C, MLIF treatment

formaldehyde and stained for confocal microscopy using anti-

significantly enhanced eNOS expression both in hypoxia and
oxidized LDL stimulation. Importantly, the NO production
was also increased by MLIF in oxidized LDL-treated brain
vascular endothelial cells. This indicated that MLIF can
upregulate eNOS and enhance NO production in hypoxia or
oxidized LDL-stimulated endothelial cells with pathological
conditions, which may protect the dysfunction of brain
endothelium.
To further substantiate the role of eEF1A1 interaction for
MLIF-induced eNOS upregulation, we synthesized eEF1A1
siRNA, which showed remarkable ability for eEF1A1 knockdown.
As shown in Figure 5D, the upregulation ability of
eNOS in bEnd.3 cells was significantly attenuated by
eEF1A1 knockdown. Consistent with the eNOS expression,
the NO production that enhanced by MLIF was also blocked
by eEF1A1 knockdown. These data indicated that targeting
eEF1A1 is required for MLIF-induced eNOS upregulation in
brain endothelial cells.
The eEF1A1/eNOS Pathway Is Responsible for the
Anti-Inflammatory Effect of MLIF
On the basis of MLIF targeting the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway,
we next used eEF1A1 knockdown or eNOS inhibitor to
investigate the role of the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway on the
protective effect of MLIF. We used NG-nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester, the inhibitor of eNOS, in pretreatment of brain
vascular endothelial bEnd.3 cells. The inhibitory effect of
MLIF on ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression was greatly attenuated
by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester pretreatment, which
indicated eNOS upregulation is required for effect of MLIF
(Figure 6A–B).
After eEF1A1 knockdown by siRNA, the bEnd.3 cells
were treated with oxidized LDL and ICAM-1/VCAM-1
expression was determined by Western blot. As shown in
Figure 6C, the inhibitory effect of MLIF on oxidized LDL-
induced ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression was blocked by
eEF1A1 knockdown, which indicated that eEF1A1 is required
for protective roles of MLIF in brain microvascular
endothelial cells. Taken together, our data suggested that the
eEF1A1/eNOS pathway is responsible for the inhibitory
effect of MLIF on inflammatory adhesion molecule ICAM-
1/VCAM-1 expression.
Discussion
In this study, we present the evidence to find a potential
medical valuable pentapeptide, MLIF, can protect brain
ischemic injury with an anti-inflammatory role in cerebrovascular
endothelium. The protection of MLIF in vitro is
demonstrated to inhibit oxidized LDL and hypoxia-induced
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, at the same time as
enhancing eNOS expression in cultured cerebrovascular endothelial
cells. For the target scanning, we explored biotinconjugated
MLIF pulldown assay and biological mass spectrum
identification, which confirmed MLIF binds to the
ribosomal protein translation elongation factor eEF1A1, especially
at domain I of eEF1A1. Targeting eEF1A1 and thus
enhancing eNOS expression contribute to the protective
action of MLIF in cerebrovascular endothelium. The eEF1A1

responsible for the inhibitory effect of MLIF in oxLDL-induced inflammatory marker protein ICAM-1 (A) and VCAM-1 (B) expression.
Pretreated with eNOS inhibitor L-NAME (105 M) for 1 hour and stimulated with 105 M oxLDL for 2 hours, the bEnd.3 cells were
treated with MLIF (50 mg/mL) for 6 hours, and the adhesion molecules were determined by immunoblotting. Normalized expression

knockdown or eNOS inhibition both attenuated the inhibitory
effect of MLIF on oxidized LDL-induced adhesion molecules
expression. Thus, we found a new pentapeptide, MLIF, which
can protect brain ischemia injury through targeting the
eEF1A1/eNOS pathway (Figure 6D).
MLIF was first found to be an anti-inflammatory active
peptide in axenic culture of E. histolytic.21 The antiinflammatory
effect of MLIF led us to test whether it can
protect inflammatory response in brain ischemia. During the
pathological process after the onset of ischemia, the expressions
of adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
were increased greatly, which mediates a pivotal role in
ischemic injury by promoting leukocytes adhering to the
vascular endothelium and crucially aggravating the inflammatory
response.22 It is reported that anti-ICAM-1 antibody
reduces ischemic damage in the transient MCAO rat.23 As
expected, the data first validated our hypothesis that MLIF
can protect brain injury in cerebrovascular ischemia by an
anti-inflammatory role with antagonism on ICAM-1/
VCAM-1 expressions.
However, what is the mechanism of this protective role and
what is the target of this anti-inflammatory action of MLIF,
especially in cerebrovascular endothelium? These questions
have never been mentioned in previous studies. On the basis
of the remarkable protective effect of MLIF for brain MCAO
injury and the inhibitory effect on ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expressions
in brain microvascular endothelial cells, we further
explored the pulldown assay and biological mass spectrum
method to search the potential target, in which we confirmed
that eEF1A1 was the intracellular binding protein of MLIF.
Our data also proved that eEF1A1 is required for MLIF-
induced upregulation of eNOS. Thus, we demonstrated that
MLIF protects brain ischemic injury through the eEF1A1/
eNOS pathway.
The regulation of eNOS plays the key role in blood vessels
and regulates almost all kinds of vascular functions.24,25 In
many pathological conditions, the abnormal modulation of
eNOS has been shown to cause several vascular diseases.26–29
In ischemia, NO produced by eNOS can inhibit platelet
aggregation and adhesion, prevent leukocyte adhesion to the
endothelium, inhibit smooth muscle proliferation, and stimulate
endothelial cell regeneration.30–35 It is reported that
administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, NO synthase
inhibitors, can cause increased blood pressure and
vasoconstriction and enhance leukocytes rolling and adherence.36 In the present study, we demonstrate that MLIF can
upregulate eNOS expression, which is also required for the
inhibitory effect on the hypoxia or oxidized LDL-induced
adhesion molecule expression, indicating a new therapeutic
role for protecting cerebrovascular endothelium injury in
response to brain ischemia.
The regulation of eNOS is reported at multiple levels,
including gene transcription, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational
mechanisms and protein–protein interactions.37,38 It is also reported that the modulation of eNOS
mRNA stability plays an important role in eNOS regulation,
especially in response to pathological stimuli, including
oxidized LDL and cytokine tumor necrosis factor-.39Importantly
, eNOS mRNA stability was found to be regulated by
statins,40which are widely used in clinical cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism
of eNOS mRNA stability remains unclear. Kosmidou et
al40 reported statins could enhance eNOS mRNA polyadenylation
and thus increase mRNA stability. Recently, eEF1A1
was identified as a cytosolic protein that binds to the eNOS
3-UTR in endothelial cells in response to tumor necrosis
factor- stimulation, which provides a new therapeutic target
that protects endothelium.20 Fortunately, our pulldown assay
showed that MLIF can directly interact with eEF1A1, which
contributed to MLIF-induced eNOS upregulation. Thus, our
finding may present a new therapeutic drug candidate for
enhancing eNOS mRNA stability and protecting cerebrovascular
endothelium injury from brain ischemia.
In summary, our study proved a new therapeutic pentapeptide
, MLIF, which can protect brain ischemia injury through
targeting the eEF1A1/eNOS pathway. Further studies may be
carried on in preclinic investigations to evaluate the medical
use of MLIF for brain ischemia.
