Abstract
Intracerebral-intraventricular hemorrhages (ICH/IVH) in very preterm
neonates are responsible for high mortality and subsequent disabilities.
In humans, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) initiates
fibrinolysis and activates endoluminal-endothelial receptors; dysfunction
of the t-PA inhibitor (PAI-1) results in recurrent hemorrhages. We
used PAI-1 knockout (PAI-1j/j) mice to examine the role of t-PA in
age-dependent intracranial hemorrhages as a possible model of preterm
ICH/IVH. Intracortical injection of 2 KL of phosphate-buffered
saline produced a small traumatic injury and a high rate of hemorrhage
in PAI-1j/j pups at postnatal day 3 (P3) or P5, whereas it had no
effect in wild-type neonates. This resulted in white matter and cortical
lesions, ventricle enlargement, hyperlocomotion, and altered cortical
levels of serotonin and dopamine in the adult PAIj/j mice.N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor blockers, plasmin- and matrix metalloproteinases
inhibitors reduced hemorrhage and tissue lesions. In contrast to P3 to
P5, no significant hemorrhages were induced in P10 PAI-1j/j pups
and there were no behavioral or neurochemical alterations in adulthood.
These data suggest that microvascular immaturity up to P5 in
mice is a determinant factor required for t-PAYdependent vascular
rupture. Neonatal PAI-1j/j mice could be a useful ICH/IVH model
for studying the ontogenic window of vascular immaturity and vascular
protection against later neurodisabilities.

INTRODUCTION
Preterm birth is a risk factor for impaired neurological
outcome including motor, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities.
When the brain is prematurely deprived of maternal/
placental factors while ontogeny is ongoing, there is increased
risk for the development of brain damage, particularly when
there are additional acute events such as hypoxia, inflammation
, and infection. In extreme preterm infants (i.e. those born
at 24Y28 weeks of gestation), intracerebral-intraventricular
hemorrhages (ICH/IVH) are the most commonly acquired
neurological lesion (1, 2). Their occurrence is related to hemodynamic
instability, hypercapnea, vascular immaturity,
and unbalanced hemostasis (3).
In preterm newborn blood, tissue plasminogen activator
(t-PA), the initiator of fibrinolysis, is low while its main inhibitor
(plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1]) is high;
this results in low fibrinolysis (4, 5). We recently demonstrated
that in extreme preterm newborns, t-PA and PAI-1
undergo abnormal increases in early postnatal days that
paralleled the hemorrhage risk (5). Because the amplitude
of PAI-1 rise largely exceeds that of the t-PA rise, the t-PA/
PAI-1 ratio is significantly lower, which may favor the formation
of microthrombi and microvessel obstruction (6).
Subsequent ischemia may, therefore, lead to the rupture of
immature brain microvessels (7). A combination of drainage
and intraventricular infusion of human recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (hrt-PA) has been tried to dissolve intraventricular
clots in preterm neonates with posthemorrhagic
hydrocephalus. This approach had to be discontinued because
of increased intraventricular bleeding (8). Similarly, the use of
exogenous hrt-PA as a thrombolytic in adult stroke is hindered
by an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation that
results from both proteolytic and receptor-mediated effects of
hrt-PA on endothelial cells and the microenvironment (9).
PAI-1 gene alterations are also associated with bleeding after
surgery in adults (10) and with cerebral palsy in very preterm
infants (11).
Preterm brain hemorrhages mainly occur in the periventricular
germinal zone, an area where the rich vasculature

undergoes constant remodeling and where the endothelium has
incomplete coverage by astrocytes and pericytes (12, 13). The
fragility of the vasculature in these areas likely results from weak
physical support but also from age-dependent t-PA secretion and
activity. Indeed, pericytes downregulate t-PA secretion by endothelial
cells and secrete PAI-1 in noxious conditions (14).
Endothelial cells also promote PAI-1 expression in astrocytes
that in turn limit t-PA efflux towards brain parenchyma (15, 16).
An age-dependent t-PA sensitivity in neonates may come
from t-PA potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate
receptor signaling because these receptors are much
higher in neonatal than in adult brain endothelial cells (9, 17).
Neonatal endothelial cells also secrete more t-PA and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9) than adult cells, and vascular
MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities are enhanced in PAI-1
gene-inactivated (PAI-1j/j) mice in several neonatal brain
lesion models (17, 18).
t-PA has potential vascular effects through activation of
the low-density lipoprotein receptorYrelated protein 1 (LRP-1),
leading to the induction of MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression
(19, 20), vasoactivity (21), and endothelial injuries that may
be associated with vascular rupture (22). Moreover, MMP-3
has been shown to inactivate PAI-1 (23). The functions of
PAI-1 are also complex. Overexpression of PAI-1 reduced infarct
volume in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
model and neonatal transient ischemia (24, 25), but at the same
time, PAI-1 aggravated edema in ischemic areas (24). Indeed,
some effects of t-PA are not abolished by the t-PAYPAI-1
complex formation but, to the contrary, are enhanced, for example
, the binding to LRP-1 and its downstream effects (26).
PAI-1 overexpression was also deleterious in thrombotic stroke
as it delayed re-perfusion (24)
Altogether, it seems that t-PA is involved in the agedependent
vascular vulnerability. In this study, we used PAI-
1j/j mice to examine the role of t-PA in age-dependent
intracranial hemorrhages as a putative model of preterm IVH.
Hemorrhage downstream effects on tissue lesions, behavior,
and neurotransmitter (NT) levels were measured in the days
after insult and in mature mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Experiments were performed in mice with inactivated
PAI-1 gene (PAI-1j/j) and wild-type (WT) mice with the same
genetic background C57BL6/129 (27, 28). Homozygous PAI-1
knockout mice (PAI-1j/j) are viable, fertile, and do not exhibit
major fibrinolytic impairment in adults (27, 28). Double
knockouts of PAI-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PAj/j)
were produced by crossing PAI-1j/jand t-PAj/jmice (29) to
raise a homozygous colony. All procedures used were approved
by the regional ethics committee for animal experimentation of
Normandy (Agreement N/04-09-06/17 for cerebral lesions) in
accordance with French law and recommendations of the
National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM).
Intracortical injections of sterile phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; pH 7.4) were performed in the somatosensory cortex
under light isoflurane anesthesia at postnatal day 3 (P3), P5, P8,
or P10, 3 mm below the scalp surface using a 25-gauge needle.
Two 1-KL injections with needle retraction were performed
followed by a 10-second latency. Animals were immediately
returned to their dams. Drugs were given intraperitoneally in
10 KL of sterile PBS. Up to P15 animals were killed by decapitation.
Adult animals were killed by cervical dislocation
and decapitation. Brains were rapidly dissected out, fixed in
4% formaldehyde for histology, or put on an ice-cold surface
for tissue microdissections.
Macroscopic Hemorrhage Grade,
Hemorrhage Index
All brains were graded macroscopically at time of dissection
on visual determination of hemorrhage occurrence and
severity (Fig. 1A). Brains were graded as level 1 (no hemorrhage),
2 (needle track), 3 (intraparenchymal hemorrhage), or 4 (subdural

hemorrhage). Grades 3 and 4 were considered hemorrhagic. A
hemorrhage index was calculated for each experimental group as
the proportion of grade 3 and 4 brains. In adult brains, hemorrhage
tracks were visualized by Perls staining of iron trapped in
macrophages. Hemorrhage was quantified as a rostrocaudal extent
of blue staining in serial frontal sections.
Histologic Examination and Quantification of
Cortical and White Matter Lesions
Paraffin-embedded brains were cut in frontal serial 10-Km
sections and stained with Cresyl violet. The number of sections
with cortical and/or white matter (WM) injuries multiplied by
10 Km provided the measurement of the rostrocaudal extent of
lesions, as previously validated for accurate lesion measurement
in neonatal brain in an excitotoxic lesion paradigm (30).
Observations were performed by an expert unaware of group
assignment of individual mice.
Volumes of the lateral ventricle were estimated by
Cresyl violet stains of adult (P60YP90) animals by integrating
the surface in every fifth section from the interhemispheral
junction of the corpus callosum (bregma +1.18) to the frontal
pole of the hippocampus (bregma j1.06), according to the
C57BL6 mouse brain atlas (31).
Pharmacological Treatments
Treatments were conducted in P5 PAI-1j/j neonates
using plasmin inhibitor and plasminogen activation inhibitor
(aprotinin and ?-aminocaproic acid [EACA]), NMDA-type
glutamate receptor channel blockers (MK801 and memantine),
gelatinase/collagenase inhibitors (Invitrogen agents 444247 and
444249), or a broad-spectrum matrix MMP inhibitor (GM6001).
All agents were dissolved in PBS except MMP inhibitors, which
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All agents were
injected intraperitoneally once (15 minutes before cortex injury),
twice (15 minutes prior and 72 hours after cortex injury), or daily

adult mice exhibited significantly larger iron deposits versus corresponding WT-lesioned animals (p G 0.001 and p G 0.05, respectively
). (D) Histology of brain lesions in matured PAI-1j/j animals injected at P5 (D

myelin revealed thinning of the external capsule, ventricle dilation in the right (injected) hemisphere, reduced number of myelinated
fascicles crossing the striatum, and reduced myelination of deepest cortical layers (open arrowheads) (D
1, 2
). Cresyl violet
staining revealed astrogliosis (hatched arrow) and external capsule weakening (arrow) in P5-injected pups (D

). In P10-injured
mice, cortical astrogliosis (short thick arrow) was often observed, whereas WM lesion atrophy (thin arrow) or cavity lesion coalescent
to ventricle (long, thick arrow) was less often present (D

). (E) Cortical lesions induced at P5 or P10 measured by
microscopy in sections obtained from brains collected 5 days after insult or in adults. A combined study of WT and PAI-1j/j, age at

3,144
= 8.764, p G 0.0001). Bonferroni post 2-way ANOVA analysis
showed a very significant difference between animal strains 5 days and 8 weeks after insult (pG0.001 and pG0.01, respectively). In
addition, in PAI-1j/j mice, cortical lesions were significantly lower in P10- than in P5-lesioned animals (p G 0.001).(F) WM lesions

= 7.447, p G 0.0001).
WM lesions in PAI-1j/j mice were significantly lower in P10-lesioned animals 5 days after insult (p G 0.001). The size of lesions
induced at P5 significantly decreased in adults in PAI-1j/j, whereas an increase was observed in WT mice (pG 0.01 and pG 0.001,
respectively). (G) Ventricle (V) dilation in an adult PAI-1j/j mouse injected at P5. (H) Correlational study of the volume of

volume was enhanced in P5-injected PAI-1j/j adult mice compared to PAI-1j/j uninjected controls (pG0.01) or compared to P5-

from P5 to P9 (memantine). Effects at the tissue level were estimated
after 5 days or at adulthood.
Behavioral Studies
Locomotor activity was measured in adults (60Y90 days)
in a Versamax 4.2 apparatus (Accuscan Instruments Inc.,
Columbus, OH). Horizontal and vertical activities, resting time,
and distance run were measured with photocells for 6 hours
and were expressed as 10-minute bouts. Mixed lesioned and
control mice were tested in each run. Males and females were
tested on separate days. Open field activity was tested during
30 minutes in the same device as locomotor activity but on a
4-fold larger surface (40 40 cm) under 200 lx. Activity was
recorded every 5 minutes.
A black-and-white 2-compartment test was used to assess
light aversion. The animals were isolated for 15 minutes
and were then placed in the black compartment. The time
spent in the black and in the white compartments were recorded
over 5 minutes (Videotrack MV 45 system; ViewPoint,
Lyon, France).
The elevated plus maze was used to assess anxiety. The
animals were isolated for 15 minutes and were then placed at
the center of the maze, with the head facing a closed arm. The
time spent in open and in closed arms and in the central area
during a 5-minute period was recorded using videotracking
(EthoVision XT; Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands).
Home cage activity was monitored in 60- to 90-day-old mice
using the Imetronic Actimeter (Pessac, France). Animals were
isolated in a ventilated rack under a light/dark cycle (light on
from 7:00 to 19:00). Mice were monitored for 72 hours,
allowing a mean 24-hour activity representation. Photocell
detectors recorded horizontal and vertical activities.
Morris water maze was used to assess spatial learning
abilities from the age of 70 days with a fixed platform position
procedure (NW quadrant). Animals were submitted to four
60-second daily trials (with a 2-minute intertrial interval) on
4 consecutive days. The starting point varied across trials and
days. Once they found the platform, mice were allowed to
remain there for 10 seconds of reinforcement. If the animal
failed to find the platform before 60 seconds, it was gently
guided to the platform and also given 10 seconds of reinforcement.
The total distance swum to find the platform was

measured. At 8 days after the end of learning trials, the animals
were tested for cognitive flexibility (i.e. transfer). Four
daily trials were performed on 2 consecutive days with a
different platform position on each day (SE and NE). Performance
was assessed for each trial by the mean distance swum
to find the platform in the 2 days of transfer. Data acquisition
was performed using the ANY-Maze video-tracking software
(Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) (Text, Supplemental Digital
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A571).
NT Measurements
Adult males or females exposed to neonatal insults and
locomotor activity tests were killed 15 days after testing.
Samples of the parietal cortex and striatum (ipsilateral and
contralateral to insult) at the rostrocaudal level of insult and
bilateral frontal cortex were collected. Tissue fragments were
homogenized by ultrasonication in ice-cold 1N perchloric acid
0.1% cysteine and were then centrifuged. The supernatants
were kept frozen at j80-C until high-performance liquid
chromatographyYelectrochemical (HPLC-EC) was performed
for the detection of NT. Pellets were collected for protein
measurement by Bradford assay. Levels of norepinephrine
(NE), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), dopamine
(DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic
acid (HVA), 3-methoxytyramine (3MT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid (5HIAA), and serotonin (5HT) were determined
using a reverse-phased ion pair HPLC-EC system (Text, Supplemental
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A571).
Statistical Analyses
Macroscopically graded hemorrhage indices were compared
between pairs of conditions using the Fisher exact test.
Histological lesions of the cortex, white matter, ventricle volumes
, NTs, and metabolites were compared according to independent
parameters (e.g. genotype and treatment, sex and
genotype) using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by post hoc Bonferroni test for multiple group comparisons or
Dunnett test for control group comparisons. Intergroup comparisons
in any unique genotype or neuroprotection studies were
performed using 1-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey multiple
group comparison test. Intergenotype comparisons were performed
using Student test. Three-way ANOVAs with genotype,
sex, and activity or water maze performances as repeated measures
were used. Follow-up comparisons were made with Tukey
tests. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software
(San Diego, CA), except data for the home cage activity and
water maze experiment, which were analyzed with Statistica
v5 StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK).
RESULTS
PAI-1 Knockout-induced Phenotype
PAI-1j/j mice showed differences versus WT mice for
several criteria. The length of gestation was reduced in PAI-
1j/j mice (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, Part A,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A572). Because plugs were allowed
overnight and gestation day 1 was counted on the following
morning, bias in maturity difference in pups was
avoided; all experiments were performed in animals born in
the morning of day 20 considered post-natal day 1 (P1). Water
content of the brain was reduced in PAI-1j/j mice (F
1,106
=
25.13, p G 0.001) (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2,
Part B, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A572). The volume of lateral
cerebral ventricles in adults was higher in PAI-1j/j than
in WT mice (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, Part C,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A572). Spontaneous locomotor activity
was higher in both sexes of PAI-1j/j mice versus WT
mice at 3- and 6-hour time intervals (Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 2, Part C, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A572).
Hyperactivity in PAI-1j/j mice was also observed together
with a less anxious behavior in the black-and-white box
test (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, Parts EYG,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A572), as well as in the open field
and elevated plus maze (not shown). Monoaminergic NT
contents were marginally affected in PAI-1j/j mice compared
to those WT animals (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A573; Table, Supplemental Digital
Content 4, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A574; Table, Supplemental
Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A575).
Phenotype differences between WT and PAI-1j/j mice
affecting biological, morphological, biochemical, and behavioral
criteria excluded the possibility of using PBS-injected WT
pups as controls. Thus, data were analyzed using both naive
PAI-1j/j pups and injured WT mice as controls in combined
analyses.
Influence of Age at Insult Time on the
Hemorrhage Index and Tissue Lesions in WT
and PAI-1j/j Mice
Hemorrhage indices evaluated 5 days after injections at
P3, P5, P8, or P10 did not show hemorrhage scores reaching
levels 3 or 4 in WT mice (index = 0). Conversely, PBS
injections consistently provoked hemorrhages in PAI-1j/jpups.
Hemorrhage index was high in P3-injected, maximal in P5-
injected, and reduced in P8- and P10-injected animals (Fig. 1B).
Microscope examination of lesion size as a function of
age at injection revealed histological tracks in the cortex and
white matter 5 days after insult in WT mice (Fig. 1C
5
). In P3
and P5 lesioned PAI-1j/j mice observed 5 days later, there
were large blood accumulations that often communicated with
the lateral ventricle, WM thinning, and focal depopulation of
the cortex. Cavitated lesions in the WM were also often
observed (Fig. 1C
1Y4
). In older PAI-1j/j pups, blood was less
often observed, whereas WM cavities or inflammatory areas
were frequently along with cortical neuronal depopulation
(Fig. 1C
6
). Blood was rarely observed in WT mice, but there
were small WM and cortical injuries (Fig. 1C
5
). Statistical
analysis of lesion size revealed a relationship between age
and genotype in the cortex (Fig. 1D) and WM (Fig. 1E). In
WT mice, cortical lesions were small and independent of the
age of the animals, whereas in WM, the lesion size depended
on age at injection time. Lesions produced at P5 were larger
than lesions produced at P3 or P10 (Fig. 1D, E). In PAI-1j/j
pups, cortical and WM lesions showed a size profile similar
to that of the hemorrhages, that is, lesions induced at P5 were
significantly larger in the cortex and the WM than in the
3 other groups (Fig. 1D, E).

Effect of Genotype on Hemorrhage Index and
Tissue Lesions
Hemorrhage indices in PAI-1j/jmice were higher than
in either WT or heterozygous pups (Fig. 1F). In WT and in
heterozygous pups born from WT dams, hemorrhage indices
were zero. In heterozygous pups born from PAI-1j/j dams
and in t-PAYPAI-1 double knockouts, hemorrhagic indices
were low and did not differ from those of WT mice (Fig. 1F).
At the microscopic level, lesion sizes in the cortex and in
the WM were greater by 2-fold in heterozygous versus those in
WT controls, whatever the genotype of dams; however, this did
not significantly differ from the WT mice (Fig. 1G). PAI-1j/j
mice had large cortical and WM lesions than WT or heterozygous
pups, whereas t-PAYPAI-1 double knockout pups had
lesions similar to those in WT mice (Fig. 1G).
Kinetics of Hemorrhage in PAI-1j/j P5 Mice
Hemorrhage indices were low at 3 hours after insult in both
WT and PAI-1j/j mice (Fig. 2A). Divergent profiles between
groups appeared after 24 hours; in WT mice, the index decreased
to zero after 48 hours. By contrast, PAI-1j/j mice exhibited
maximal hemorrhage indices at 24 hours after insult, followed by
a progressive decrease. Recurrent hemorrhages occurred in the
majority of PAI-1j/j pups on day 5 (120 hours) (Fig. 2A).
Evolution of Tissue Lesions in Adults
In WT adult mice lesioned at P5 or P10, Perls staining
showed small tracks, whereas tracks that were 1 mm in length
were observed in PAI-1j/j mice (Fig. 2B, C). Unexpectedly,
tracks in PAI-1j/j mice injected at P10 were no different
from tracks in P5-injected animals, although macroscopic
hemorrhage in P10 pups was low (Fig. 1B).
Cortical and WM lesions induced at P5 or P10 were
measured by microscopy in brains collected 5 days after insult
or at adulthood. Luxol fast-blue staining of myelin showed
WM atrophy, with interruption or weakening of the external
capsule and drastic reduction of myelinated fascicles of the
internal capsule crossing the caudate-putamen. Reduced myelinated
fibers ascending in the cortex were also observed
(Fig. 2D
1,2
). Cresyl violet staining revealed astrogliosis, external
capsule thinning, and ventricle dilation (Fig. 2D
3Y6
).
Cytoarchitectural abnormalities were observed in Cresyl
violetYstained WT brain sections 5 days after insult and, to a
lesser extent, in adults. In PAI-1j/j mice, lesions were larger
than those in WT mice after 5 days; the differences remained in
adults (Fig. 2E, F). P5-induced lesions decreased in size with
age to adulthood in PAI-1j/j mice, whereas they increased
in WT mice. P10-induced lesions were small in both WT and
PAI-1j/j mice and their sizes did not change between 5 days
and 8 weeks after insult (Fig. 2E, F).
Ventricle Dilation
Ventricle dilation was observed in PAI-1j/j brains
lesioned at P5 (Fig. 2G). Postinjury ventricle dilation was
evaluated ipsilateral and contralateral to injections in adults
(Fig. 2IYK). P5-injected PAI-1j/jmice had significantly larger
bilateral ventricle dilation than WT or non-injected PAI-1j/j
mice (Fig. 2I). Ventricle enlargement was more pronounced
ipsilateral than contralateral to the lesion (Fig. 2J, K). Dilation
on the contralateral side indicated that enlargement resulted
from cerebrospinal fluid retention. Ipsilateral to contralateral
comparison in all groups revealed significantly higher ipsilateral
dilation only in PAI-1j/j mice injected at P5 (Fig. 2IYK).
A correlational study of the volume of ventricles and the
extent of hemorrhage estimated by Perls staining in the whole
series of P5- or P10-injected WT and PAI-1j/j animals
revealed a positive correlation (r2 = 0.36) with slope significantly
different from zero (p = 0.02). Forced X
0
intercept at
volume level in controls (1.14 mm3) increased the significance
of correlation to p G 0.001 (Fig. 2H).
Neuroprotection Treatments
Blood concentrations of glutamate were measured in
trunk and cephalic blood of PAI-1j/j mice in control and
P5-injected animals. Concentrations were similar in the cephalic
and trunk blood of control animals, whereas concentrations
were enhanced in the cephalic blood of P5-lesioned
PAI-1j/j pups 24 hours and 5 days after insult, indicating
that hemorrhagic brains released significant amounts of glutamate
to the circulation and validating the hypothesis of a
glutamatergic excitotoxic component after hemorrhage in
PAI-1j/jmice lesions (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 6,

activity yielded significant effects for time of day (F
7,420

between these 2 factors (F

= 3.19, p G 0.01). Interaction between lesion and time of day did not reach significance (F
7,420
=
1.90, p = 0.068). Follow-up comparisons showed that females had a higher rearing activity than males during the first 2 segments
of the test (19:00 to 22:00 and 22:00 to 01:00, p G 0.001). Even if it seemed that animals with lesion had more numerous rears at
the beginning of the dark phase, no statistical effect was found. (E) The distance to find the platform in the Morris water maze
learning phase decreased over days, indicating an overall increase in the performance of mice (F
3,156

as well as a significant effect for sex (F
1,52
= 4.95, p G 0.05) and repeated trials (F

indicated that the lesion significantly altered the females’ performances in trial 2 versus female controls (pG0.05) and in trial 2 and
trial 4 versus lesioned males (pG0.001 and pG0.05, respectively). * Comparison with PAI-1j/j controls: *, pG0.05; **, pG0.01. §

http://links.lww.com/NEN/A576). Together with NMDA receptor
enrichment in neonatal endothelial cells, these data
indicated that the effects of glutamate NMDA receptor
blockers, as well as plasminogen-plasmin and MMP in
hibitors, should be investigated. Neuroprotection was estimated
using hemorrhage index and Cresyl violet histology
5 days after insult at P5 (Fig. 3). MK801 and memantine reduced
the hemorrhage index, although with lower efficiencies
than aprotinin and EACA. GM6001 and 444247 significantly
reduced hemorrhage indices versus DMSO, which did not
show an effect; 444249 was inactive (Fig. 3A).
On histological examination, not all treatments produced
significant neuroprotection. In the cortex, aprotinin, memantine,
and GM6001 were the most effective (Fig. 3B, D, F). In the
WM, EACA, memantine, and 444247 were the most effective
agents (Fig. 3C, E, G). Agent 444249 had no effect on
lesion size (Fig. 3F, G).
Effect of P5 Lesions on Adult Behavior in
PAI-1j/j Mice
Insult at P5 in WT mice had no effect on locomotor
activity (not shown). Conversely, in PAI-1j/j sex-matched
mice, P5 lesions significantly enhanced locomotor activity up
to 60 minutes. Separate analysis in males and females showed
enhanced activity for 3 hours. Lesion-related effects disappeared
at longer time intervals, but females became more
hyperactive than males (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 7,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A577). In the first 60 minutes,
P5-lesioned males and females had enhanced horizontal
activity (Fig. 4A). Vertical activity measurements showed
similar tendencies (Fig. 4B). No difference in displacement
speed was measured. Lesions induced at P10 had no effects
on these tests (Fig. 4A, B).
In the home cage, horizontal activity varied with the
time of day. Interactions were observed with sex and P5
lesions (not shown). A slight decrease in the 22:00 to 01:00
dark phase occurred in lesioned animals (Fig. 4C). A tendency
to increase in rears was observed in lesioned mice at the beginning
of the dark phase (19:00 to 22:00 period) (Fig. 4D).
In the Morris water maze, P5 lesions or sex did not
influence spatial learning (Fig. 4E). A significant interaction
for learning plasticity (transfer) was found between hemorrhage
lesion, sex, and transfer trials. Follow-up comparisons
indicated that lesions significantly altered female performances
in trial 2 versus control females and in trial 2 and trial
4 versus lesioned males (Fig. 4F).
In the black-and-white box test, P5 lesions decreased rest
time in males and females, although they had no effect on the
total distance covered (Fig. 5A, B) and had no influence over
the time spent in the black-and-white compartment (Fig. 5C).
In the open field test, the activity of P5-lesioned PAI-1j/j
mice was increased as estimated by resting time or distance
covered. The effects were significant in females, although the
same tendency was observed in males (Fig. 5D, E). The lesions
had no effect on the time spent in the central area of the field
(Fig. 5F). P10-lesioned mice showed marginal behavior alteration
in the open field test (Fig. 5F).
In the elevated plus maze, total distance and open-arm
or closed-arm entries were enhanced specifically in female
P5-lesioned PAI-1j/j mice along with reduced rest time; this
was not observed in males. These increases similarly affected
the different parameters; thus, enhancement of closed-arm
entries was more likely to reflect a global enhancement of
activity than un-anxious behavior (Fig. 5GYI).
Effects of Lesions at P5 or P10 in Adult NT and
Metabolites in Adults
PAI-1 inactivation induced minor effects in NT (NE,
5HT, and DA) and metabolite (MHPG, 5HIAA, HVA, DOPAC,
and 3MT) concentrations in adult striatum, parietal, and
frontal cortices (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3,

Content 4, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A574; Table, Supplemental
Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A575).
Effects in the Frontal Cortex
NE, MHPG, and MHPG/NE ratios in the adult frontal
cortex were not affected by P5- or P10-induced injuries in sexmatched
adults (Fig. 6AYC) or in males or females analyzed

separately (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 8, PartsAYC,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A578).
5HT levels in sex-matched adults were significantly reduced
in P5- and P10-lesioned animals (Fig. 6D). The level of
5HIAA was also reduced in the P5-lesioned group (Fig. 6E).
Sex-separated analysis revealed the interaction of sex with
lesion in 5HT levels (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 8,
Part D, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A578).
DA was not altered in sex-matched P5- or P10-lesioned
groups (Fig. 6G), whereas its final metabolite HVA was
reduced in P5-lesioned females (Fig. 6H). HVA/DA ratios
were not affected (Fig. 6I). No sex differences were observed
for DA and HVA (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 9,
Parts GYI, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A579). Ratios of the
DA metabolites DOPAC and 3MT versus DA were unaffected
by P5 or P10 insults (not shown).
Effects in the Parietal Cortex
NTs and metabolites were measured ipsilateral and
contralateral to insult. NE and MHPG were significantly
lower in both sides of the parietal cortex in sex-matched P5-
injected animals. In P10 injured mice, NE and MHPG contents
were lowered ipsilateral to injury only (Fig. 7A, B). No
sex differences were observed (Figure, Supplemental Digital
Content 9, Parts AYC, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A579).
5HT and 5HIAA were decreased in the parietal cortex
ipsilateral, and 5HT was decreased contralateral to insult in
P5-induced lesions in sex-matched groups (Fig. 7C, D). Decrease
was higher in females (Figure, Supplemental Digital
Content 9, Parts D and E, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A579).
P10-injected mice showed reduced 5HT restricted to the insult
side (Fig. 7D). 5HIAA/5HT was altered in females ipsilateral
to P5 lesion (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 9, Part F,
http://links.lww.com/NEN/A579).
DA was reduced both ipsilateral and contralateral to
injury in sex-matched P5-lesioned groups (Fig. 7E). In P10-
injected animals, both DA and HVA were reduced ipsilateral
to injection (Fig. 7E, F). None of the ratios of HVA, 3MT,
and DOPAC versus DA showed significant alteration in any
group (not shown). Sex-separated analysis revealed a higher
amplitude of the effects in females (Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 9, PartsGYI, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A579).
Effects in the Striatum
NE, 5HT, 5HIAA, DA, and HVA levels were not affected
by insult at P5 or at P10, either ipsilateral or contralateral
to the insult in the striatum (Figure, Supplemental
Digital Content 10, http://links.lww.com/NEN/A580). Males
and females were not different in this regard (not shown).
DISCUSSION
PAI-1 inactivation allowed hemorrhage to develop after
minor brain trauma in the immature mouse brain during the
developmental window between birth and 5 days after birth
but had no major effects after P8. The consequences of
hemorrhage included damage to the cortex and WM that
resulted in ventriculomegaly, reduced 5HT and DA in the
parietal and frontal cortices, and hyperactivity in adult mice.
Neurotransmitter reduction in the cortex was higher in female
mice, which also exhibited greater behavioral effects.
Preterm birth before 33 weeks of gestation is associated
with an elevated risk of neurological disabilities (2, 32). The
shorter the gestation, the higher the risk of neonatal brain
lesions and lasting neurological disorders, indicating that
preterm birth not only favors brain lesions but is also a risk
factor per se for developmental impairment. Nevertheless,
neonatal lesions do not uniformly result in disabled psychomotor
outcome at school age (2). The developmental dependency
of different types of lesions is well known. WM lesions
visualized by echo-lucent or echo-dense signals primarily affect
infants born between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation,
whereas hemorrhages primarily affect extreme preterms
(24Y28 weeks of gestation) and are primarily in the subventricular
zone. In this region, the vascular bed is poorly
endowed with pericytes and astrocyte end-feet (33, 34). Experimental
induction in the periventricular area of weak
neovasculature by vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression
resulted in perinatal hemorrhages in mice neonates
that likely depended on protease induction, including that of
MMP-9 (35). In a previous study, we showed that hypoxiaischemia
or intracortical ibotenic acid injection induced
gelatinolytic activity in cortical microvessels in the first 6 hours
after insult (18). These effects were amplified in PAI-1j/j
pups and preceded the hemorrhages. The present data showing
that MMP inhibitors reduced hemorrhage indices are compatible
with the notion that MMPs participate in vessel injury.
MMPs likely originate in endothelial cells; cultured immature
brain microvascular endothelial cells release both gelatinases
under glutamate challenge, whereas adult cells do not (17). The
involvement of t-PA at the origin of the prohemorrhage cascade
is confirmed by the observation that t-PA inactivation
prevented hemorrhage in P5 pups in a PAI-1j/j background.
Indeed, neonatal brain microvascular endothelial cells in culture
release more t-PA under basal or glutamate challenge than
adult cells (17, 36).
In the present model, minor tissue trauma induced local
hemorrhage and clot formation due to needle track and liquid
injection in all mice. Whether delayed large hemorrhage in
P5 PAI-1j/j pups resulted from clot instability or t-PA-MMP

cascade activation is worth questioning. The fact that trauma
only elicited bleeding up to P5 indicates that either hyperfibrinolytic
status ends before P8 or vessel maturity at P8 has
changed. The former possibility cannot be ruled out because
adult PAI-1 mice were only slightly hyperfibrinolytic (28).
In humans, altered PAI-1 gene has been associated with
hyperfibrinolysis-induced recurrent hemorrhages (10). Such
recurrences were observed in P5 PAI-1j/j mice 5 days after
insult, whereas primary insult at P10 failed to induce bleeding.
This observation suggests that a hyperfibrinolytic status
remained at P10 and was responsible for disruption of the
large clots elicited after P5 hemorrhages. Between P5 and
P10, however, another factor required for primary vessel
disruption had disappeared. We hypothesize that vessel maturation
, in terms of pericyte and astrocyte coverage and/or
basal lamina growth had occurred, and that these events limited
the mechanical vulnerability. Injury at the endothelial
extracellular environment level can also be hypothesized because
the hemorrhage index in P5-injured animals was reduced
by either plasminogen-plasmin inhibitors or MMP
inhibitors. In human extreme preterms, hyperfibrinolytic status
has not been observed. Conversely, we have shown that
PAI-1 is high in cord blood, whereas t-PA is low compared to
infants born at later terms. This pattern was further amplified in
the early postnatal days, when hemorrhage usually occurs (5).
The t-PA covalently linked to PAI-1 is a highly potent factor of
MMP cascade initiation through LRP-1 binding (26). According
to this scheme, high t-PA-PAI-1 complex would be a prohemorrhage
factor through its activity on endothelial cells in the particular
context of vascular immaturity of the germinal layer (6).
A number of animal models of preterm brain ICH/IVH
have been proposed. Collagenase injectionYproduced hemorrhage
provides a model for studying the neuropathological
consequences of intracerebral bleeding, but the model is inappropriate
for inferring maturity-dependent causation of the
rupture. Indeed, collagenase causes hemorrhage in adult animals
as well. Our approach in PAI-1j/j mice has ontogenic
limitations because the animals develop with unrestrained
t-PA, which is itself known to participate in brain ontogeny.
Indeed, phenotype differences prevent comparison of injected
PAI-1j/j and injected WT pups, and most of the time they
required comparison of control and lesioned WT and PAI-1j/j
groups by 2-way ANOVA tests. Nevertheless, PAI-1j/j
animals allowed identification of a key period of vascular 
maturation between P5 and P8 that determines the acquisition
of proteolytic cascade resistance. The effect observed in
P5-lesioned mice is likely due to endothelial vascular wall
immaturity. A descriptive study of cortical microvessels by a
proteomic approach is in progress, which we hope will identify
cell and extracellular component differences along with
maturation in line with age-dependent vulnerability.
The mechanisms responsible for hemorrhage, ventricle
dilation, glial scars, and imbalance in cortical NT in adults
cannot be extrapolated from the present data. Nevertheless,
the lack of effect of P10 lesions on these criteria allows us
to establish causal effect of hemorrhage on these features
in mature animals. Moreover, the coordinate observations
of behavior anomalies in females with serotoninergic and
dopaminergic alterations suggest a functional relationship
between neurochemical alteration and behavior. The model
will allow evaluation of the long-term effects of putative
neuroprotection strategies. The increased glutamate concentration
in cephalic blood and the effects of NMDA receptor
blockers are consistent with a posthemorrhage excitotoxic
process. The effect of MK-801 and memantine on hemorrhage
index may also occur in endothelial cells since severalfold
higher levels of NMDA-R1 are present in cells from
neonates compared to adult cells (17).
P5-induced hemorrhage in PAI-1j/j pups resulted in
hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic
system alterations in the frontal and parietal cortices
in adult mice. The hyperactivity observed in short-term tests
was marginal in long-term tests likely because of an exacerbated
response to novelty. It did not reflect anxiety-linked
disorders according to dedicated tests. Thus, altered levels of
5HT, 5HIAA, and HVA in the frontal lobe may be involved in
hyperactivity in a novel environment; imbalance in these NT
and metabolites has been associated with impulsive behavior
(37). In former very preterm infants at school age, there is more
than 20% incidence of hyperactivity/attention-deficit/executive
dysfunction (38), in contrast to 1% to 12% incidence in the
entire population (39). In executive dysfunction, frontal cortex
projections are thought to regulate striatal dopaminergic transmission
and the imbalance of NE and 5HT in the frontal projections
results in hyperactivity (40).
In conclusion, the use of PAI-1j/j mice allows the induction
of neonatal brain hemorrhage that recapitulates the
consequences of preterm hemorrhages, that is, ventricle dilation
, hyperactivity in novel environment, and frontal NT
anomalies. As in humans, neonatal mice exhibit an ontogenic
window of vulnerability permitting noxious factors (glutamate,
t-PA, and MMP) to disrupt microvessels.
