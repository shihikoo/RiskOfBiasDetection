We used a modified pial vessel disruption (PVD) protocol
with adult male Wistar rats to mimic small-vessel stroke
in the cerebral cortex. Within 3 weeks, this lesion develops
into a single lacuna-like cavity, which is fluid-filled
and encapsulated by reactive astrocytes. Minocycline
treatment that commences 1 hr after lesion and continues
for 6 days prevents the cavitation and causes a filling of
the lesion with reactive astrocytes and no barrier. Here,
we determined whether inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases-2
and -9 (MMPs) mediates this minocycline action.
Confocal microscopy revealed increased punctate staining
of MMPs inside the lesion sites after 2 days of PVD.
Astrocytes lined the lesion border but showed sparse
localization inside the lesion. In contrast, increased MMP
levels inside the lesion coincided with increased ED1 or
OX-42 immunostaining, suggesting that MMP elevation
reflected increased secretions from microglia/macrophages.
Imaging analyses also revealed that minocycline
administered for 2 days before animal euthanasia, significantly
decreased MMP levels within the lesion. Moreover,
Western blot analysis of cortical tissue extracts showed a
significant 30–40% upregulation of MMPs 2 days after
lesion. Minocycline administered 2 hr before the lesion
significantly inhibited both MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels by
40%. In contrast, minocycline administered 1 hr after
the lesion only decreased MMP-9 levels by 30%.
Because MMP inhibition with batimastat injection also
prevented cavity formation at 21 days, we conclude that
minocycline prevented the creation of a lacuna-like cyst
in the cerebral cortex by inhibiting the MMP secretion
from microglia in the affected tissue. V C 2013 Wiley Periodicals

In general, the outcome of small-vessel strokes differs
from that of larger-vessel strokes (Hainsworth and
Markus, 2008). Small-vessel strokes are related to silent
strokes, transient ischemic attacks, vascular dementia, and
lacunar infarctions (if affecting the deep penetrating
arteries). Small-vessel stroke pathophysiology is an
understudied area, so far less is known about the mechanisms
of damage concerning small- vs. large-vessel strokes
(Greenberg, 2006). To create a reliable ischemia model of
small-arterial-vessel stroke, we modified the pial vessel
stripping model, which represents a massive arterial and
venous injury in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, we selectively
disrupted only the class II medium-sized pial vessels
of a small pial surface area and left the large class I vessels
intact. This will lead to an ischemia-like small-arterialvessel
stroke in the cerebral cortex (Hua and Walz,
2006a).
We discovered that this modified pial vessel disruption
(PVD) model leads within 3 weeks to a fluid-filled
cavity, which is encapsulated by a barrier of reactive astrocytes
(Hua and Walz, 2006a). We found that, when animals
were euthanized at 3 weeks after PVD injury, the
animals treated with the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline
for 6 days post-injury showed no signs of cavity formation
; instead, the lesioned areas consisted of astrocytic
scar tissue without an obvious barrier to the surrounding
parenchyma (Hua and Walz, 2006a). However, this previous
study did not address the cellular basis for this minocycline
action, especially during the acute response within
days following the PVD lesion. A target for minocycline’s
action appears to be the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), a group of enzymes released to the extracellular
space to assist with the remodeling of the cellular architecture
of the tissue (Cunningham et al., 2005). This

would be in keeping with the observed minocycline
action within the first 6 days after lesioning. We hypothesize
that, immediately after injury, activated microglia
and/or macrophages prevent repopulation of the lesion
by reactive astrocytes and this lack of astrocytes eventually
leads to cavitation. According to this hypothesis, treatment
with minocycline would dampen microglia/macrophage
activation and therefore enable reactive astrocytes
to migrate into the lesion and transform it into a scar.
MMP-2 and -9 have a low expression in the normal
adult rat brain. After large-vessel ischemia, both MMPs
are released from astrocytes but also from microglia and
neutrophils and become activated extracellularly. Their
targets include the basal lamina to induce a leaky blood–
brain barrier (BBB) and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation
for neutrophil recruitment (Cunningham et al.,
2005; Fatar et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007). Minocycline
also appears to be a direct enzymatic inhibitor of MMP
activity (Paemen et al., 1996; Ryan et al., 2001; Sutton
et al., 2005; Machado et al., 2006). Furthermore, minocycline
has no protective effects against stroke in MMP-9-
deficient mice (Koistinaho et al., 2005). In the present
study, by using the PVD model of ischemic injury combined
with biochemical and confocal imaging analyses,
we investigated the effects of the minocycline treatment
on the acute induction of MMP-2 and -9 expressions in
cortical tissue to evaluate a possible contribution of these
MMP forms to the genesis of fluid-filled cavities in our
large-vessel stroke studies model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult Wistar rats from Charles River Laboratories International
Inc. (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) were used. The
animals had a weight between 300 and 340 g and were between
62 and 79 days old when used for surgery. Upon arrival in the
animal facility, the rats were left for an acclimatization period of
at least 1 week before starting procedures. All procedures
involving animal were approved under permit 20020024 by the
Animal Research Ethics Board of the University of
Saskatchewan.
Surgery
We have recently described our surgical procedures to
induce PVD injury (Hua and Walz, 2006a). In brief, the rats
were under 2% isoflurane anesthesia and received buprenorphine
(0.035 mg/kg) for pain management. A craniotomy was
performed with a 5-mm-diameter trephine positioned on the
right and rostral side of the bregma adjacent to the coronal and
sagittal sutures. Cool sterile saline was applied intermittently to
prevent overheating from the high-speed drilling. After
removal of the dura, the cortical surface and the overlying pial
vessels were exposed. Medium-sized (class II) pial vessels were
disrupted by fine-tipped forceps. The piece of bone was
replaced, and the scalp was then closed with a wound clip.
Sham animals received the same lesion surgery (i.e., with dura
removed) but without PVD. Age-matched control animals did
not receive any surgical manipulations. The body temperature
was monitored throughout the surgery by a rectal probe and
maintained at 37C with a heating pad. Animals were kept in a
cage separately under a warm lamp during the recovery from
anesthesia. Thereafter, the animals were returned to their cages
and sacrificed at the indicated survival times by intracardiac perfusion
(for immunohistochemistry/confocal imaging studies) or
by deep anesthesia using halothane followed by decapitation.
Minocycline and Batimastat Administration
Minocycline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was prepared
fresh 1 hr before treatment of animals by dissolving in
0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and kept protected from
light. To determine the effects of minocycline on MMP-2 and
MMP-9 production at 2 days after surgery, minocycline was
administered by injecting animals intraperitoneally at a dose of
45 mg/kg body weight either 2 hr before or 1 hr after surgery
and then again 12 hr after surgery. This was followed by
22.5 mg/kg twice daily until the animal was sacrificed 2 days after
the lesion surgery. This dosing regimen was similar to regimens
used in previous studies (Yrjanheikki et al., 1998; Hua
and Walz, 2006a; Machado et al., 2006). To assess the effect of
minocycline injections on cavity formation at 21 days, minocycline
was given at 45 mg/kg body weight at 1 hr and 12 hr
postsurgery, and, for the next 5 days, twice-daily injections of
22.5 mg/kg minocycline (morning and evening) were administered
and animals were sacrificed 21 days after surgery. Batimastat
(Sigma; catalog SML0041), a specific inhibitor of MMP-2
and MMP-9 (Wojtowicz-Praga et al., 1996; Yrjanheikki et al.,
1998; Wharton et al., 2000), was prepared as follows: 25 mg of
batimastat was first dissolved in 30 ll of 10% Tween-20, and
diluted in 3 ml of 0.1 M PBS. Batimastat (1 ml of the abovedescribed
solution) was injected intraperitoneally 2 hr before
commencing the surgery; another 1 ml was given 1 hr after the
surgery; and a final 1-ml injection was given 12 hr after surgery.
Acute and long-term (up to 41 days) toxicological studies
revealed no major toxicity of IP treatment with batimastat in
animals (Wojtowicz-Praga et al., 1996). In all sham animals that
underwent the lesion surgery but were not treated with either
minocycline or batimastat, equal volumes of saline were
injected instead.
Immunohistochemistry
The brains were removed, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight, then moved into 30% sucrose solution and
stored at 4C before sectioning. The brains were embedded in
Tissue-Tek optimal cutting compound (OCT; Sakura Finetek,
Torrance, CA), frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane,
and sectioned at 40 lm on a cryostat. The sections were
blocked in PBS containing 5% donkey serum and 0.2% Triton
X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4C
and with secondary antibodies for 2 hr (except for MMP-9
antibody: 48 hr) at room temperature in blocking solution
without Triton X-100. In some experiments in which two
mouse monoclonal antibodies were used, sequential staining
was performed by first incubating the brain sections with anti-
MMP-9 for 48 hr followed by incubation overnight at 4C
with a fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. The sections
were then blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with blocking

solutions containing nonfluorescent mouse secondary antibody,
washed three times with PBS, and subsequently incubated
overnight with mouse anti OX-42 primary antibody and with a
different fluorescently tagged secondary antibody for 2 hr. The
following primary antibody dilutions were used: anti-MMP-2
(rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge MA), anti-
MMP-9 (mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:500; UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab
Facility), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP,
1:200; mouse monoclonal IgG or rabbit polyclonal IgG; Sigma-
Aldrich), CD11b/c equivalent antibody OX-42 (mouse monoclonal
IgG, 1:200; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), and anti-ED1
(mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:200; AbD Serotec). Negative controls
omitting the primary antibodies were carried out in all
experiments for all the secondary antibodies used. After washing
in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated
with fluorescent dyes at room temperature for 2 hr in
blocking solution without Triton X-100. The secondary antibodies
included donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to FITC
and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to TRITC (1:200;
both from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) as well
as Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor
555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; both from Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). All secondary antibodies were species crossadsorbed
from Jackson Immunoresearch. Nuclei were stained
with Hoechst 33243 to distinguish the lesion and penumbra.
Brain Slice Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and
Western Blotting
Two days after the lesion, the animals were anesthetized
with halothane and sacrificed by decapitation according to protocols
approved by the University Committee of Animal Care
and Supply at the University of Saskatchewan (animal protocol
20070090). As previously described (Brust et al., 2006, 2007),
brains were rapidly extracted and placed into ice-cold oxygenated
dissection medium containing the following (in mM): 87
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 NaH

, 25 D-glucose, and 75 sucrose. Cortical brain slices
(400 lm thick) from the lesion site (right hemisphere) and also
slices from the contralateral side of the lesion (left hemisphere)
and from sham-operated or control animals (from right hemispheres
) were cut using a vibrating tissue slicer (VT1000S;
Leica, Nussloch, Germany). We then isolated cortical regions
(3 mm deep into the cortex by 3 mm wide) from these slices
containing either the lesion or control tissue and incubated
them for 1 hr at 24C in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing
(in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO

After this 1-hr recovery period, the cortical slices were homogenized
in a solubilization buffer (30 min) that contained 1%
NP-40, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 lg/ml aprotinin

,30mMNaF,40mMb-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2),
20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 3 mM benzamidine. The
tissue homogenates were then centrifuged at 13,000g (20 min,
4C) to remove cellular debris, and then protein concentrations
of the crude lysates were determined by performing a Bradford
assay with the DC Protein Assay dye (Bio-Rad, Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada). Cortical tissue homogenates were diluted
with 13 Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins
were resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada). The blots were
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST for 1 hr, and the membranes
were incubated overnight at 4C with primary antibodies
(MMP-2 anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1:2,000
[Epitomics, Burlingame, CA], MMP-9 anti-rabbit monoclonal
antibody at 1:2,000 [Epitomics], and GAPDH mouse monoclonal
antibody at 1:2,000 [Millipore, Bedford, MA]). After four
washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with the
appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(1 hr room temperature). The membranes were then
washed three or four times (15 min each) with TBST, and proteins
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;
Amersham Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL). Densitometric
analysis of the blots was performed using QuantityOne software
from Bio-Rad and ImageJ software from the NCBI. Protein
signals were quantified by normalizing all bands with the
GAPDH protein band signals. Protein bands for each of the
treatments were normalized to the lesion sections with saline
injections, and statistical significance (P<0.05) was assessed by
using a nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Dunn’s multiple-comparisons post hoc statistical test.
Immunoprecipitation was performed to verify the specificity
of the primary antibodies used in this study. Cortical
lysate (500 lg) from sham animals was diluted in solubilization
buffer (see above) and reacted with an immunoprecipitating
antibody or normal rabbit serum (overnight, 4C). MMP-2 was
immunoprecipitated with 4 lg rabbit anti-MMP-2 (Abcam),
and MMP-9 was immunoprecipitated with 4 lg rabbit anti-
MMP-9 (Epitomics). Normal rabbit IgG (0.4 lg; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a negative control
for the immunoprecipitating antibodies. After overnight incubation
, the immune complexes were captured with protein A/
G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 hr at 4C.
Agarose beads were then collected by pulse spins and washed
four times with wash buffer (solubilization buffer containing
0.1% NP-40). Immunoprecipitated proteins from the agarose
beads were eluted and detected by Western blotting as
described above.
Image Acquisition and Analysis
All fluorescence images were taken with the Zeiss LSM
700 confocal imaging microscope equipped with a 405 nm,
488 nm, 555 nm, and 639 nm solid-state laser lines. A Zeiss
Plan-Apochromat363/1.40 oil DIC objective lens was used to
obtain images for quantitative colocalization or particle analysis.
A320 dry objective confocal lens (W Plan-Apochromat320/
1.0 DIC lens) was also used to obtain overview images spanning
the lesion site. The microscope pinhole was set to 1 Airy unit
(Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006). Laser intensities, detector sensitivity
, and digital offset were set at the point where the full
dynamic range of the region of interest (ROI) was obtained.
Each fluorophore was imaged individually using the multitrack
channels to prevent dye bleed through (Zinchuk and Grossenbacher-Zinchuk
, 2009). All images were sampled at 12 bits and

were the average of two images. The optimal sampling resolution
was calculated by the imaging software (Zeiss ZEN 2009
version 5.5 SP1) in accordance with the Nyquist sampling theorem
(Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006). The resulting pixel size in
all images was set to 0.06 3 0.06 lm. For the colocalization
and particle analyses, the entire image window of 125 3
125 lm at 0.06-lm pixel resolution was used for the ROI
comparisons for the sham, saline, and minocycline treatments (1
hr after or 2 hr before the lesion). At least three ROI images
from each animal were obtained for both colocalization and
particle analyses, and the mean values for each animal were
reported as n51 in the statistical analyses. Images were
exported as eight-bit TIFF files, and the degree of colocalization
between fluorescent probes was quantified using the Intensity
Correlation Analysis plugin in ImageJ (software download
from NIH version 1.44f), which calculated both the Pearson’s
correlation coefficients and Mander’s coefficients. We report
the Pearson’s coefficients in this study since the ratio of fluorescent
signals in the two channels were different from unity.
Negative Pearson’s coefficients indicate the two signals do not
colocalize, whereas values closer to 1 indicate strong colocalization
between the two particles. To demonstrate potential
colocalization of fluorescent signals within microglia/macrophage-like
cells, z-stacked images were collected (usually 18–20
slices, 0.34-lm interval) from the lesion volume, and a threedimensional
rendering of the images (maximum projections)
was performed with the Zeiss Zen 2009 software. Particle
counts and total surface area from MMP-2- or MMP-9-immunoreactive
particles were determined by using the ImageJ plugin
for background subtraction from the ROI and setting the
threshold to 2 SD above the mean background intensity. The
images were then converted to grey-scale values before applying
the Particle Analysis feature of ImageJ. The analysis was set
to detect particle sizes between 1 lm2 and infinity.
Statistical Analysis
For both the imaging and the Western blotting analyses,
we normalized the mean values to either the saline or the sham
group and used the Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric oneway
ANOVA) with Dunn’s multiple-comparisons test to determine
the statistical significance of the mean values of all the
treatments. The reported values are mean6SD, and P<0.05
was considered significant. All statistical comparisons were performed
in GraphPad Instat3 version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA).
RESULTS
Upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in PVD
Model
We have previously reported (Hua and Walz,
2006a,b) that, in a modified PVD model, the anti-inflammatory
agent minocycline prevented the formation of a
fluid-filled cavity surrounded by astrocytes. However, the
cellular mechanism involved in the early phase of the cavity
formation remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis
that minocycline’s efficacy in preventing cavity formation
involved inhibition of microglia activation and production
of MMP-9 and MMP-2. In immunoprecipitation
studies using 500 lg of cortical brain homogenates from
sham animals, MMP-9 protein was detected at approximately
95 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and MMP-2 protein at
83 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 2), and similar bands were detected
when 50 lg cortical lysates were used in the respective
positive control lanes (Figs. 1A, 2A, lane 3). These
MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein bands were absent when
the immunoprecipitating antibodies were omitted (Figs.
1A, 2A, lane 1). The molecular weights of these MMPs
are similar to those previously reported (Planas et al.,
Fig. 1. Pial vessel disruption injury model results in increased MMP-9
expression that is blunted by minocycline treatments. A: In sham animals
, the expression of MMP-9 (95 kDa) in 50 lg of cortical brain
lysate (lane 3) was enriched when 500 lg brain lysate was reacted
with the immunoprecipitating MMP-9 antibody (lane 2) but not with
normal rabbit serum (lane 1; representative of three independent
experiments from different animals). B: Injury at the cortical lesions
induced significant elevation of MMP-9 compared with the contralateral
side of the lesion, sham-operated animals, and control (no surgery)
animals (nonparametric one-way ANOVA using Kruskal-Wallis test,
P50.0016). The 95-kDa proform of MMP-9 is present in all
groups, but an additional band at 110 kDa is present in the nonlesion
contralateral brain (top blot). The GAPDH protein signal near
37 kDa (bottom blot) was used to normalize the MMP-9 protein
bands. Numbers inside bar charts represent the number of animals
used for each treatment group. Significances between groups were
determined with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, with *P<0.05
and **P<0.01. C: Compared with saline treatments, minocycline
administered before or after the lesion inhibited MMP-9 expression to
levels similar to those in sham animals (nonparametric ANOVA,
P50.0018). Bands shown represent 86-kDa active form and 90–
95-kDa proform of MMP-9 (top blot) and 37-kDa GAPDH
(bottom blot). Numbers inside the summary bar chart represent the
number of animals used, and significant differences between saline and
other groups are as indicated, with *P<0.05 and **P<0.01. Molecular
weights were estimated from prestained protein standards. Values
in B and C are means6SD.
MMP-2 and MMP-9 in Ischemic Cavitation 923
Journal of Neuroscience Research
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1127214826)
2001; Machado et al., 2006). Consistent with our hypothesis
of an involvement of MMP production in cavity formation
, we found using quantitative Western blots that
both MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels significantly increased 2
days after inducing lesions by the PVD protocol (Figs. 1B,
2B, respectively). Care was taken to prevent dilution of
the MMP concentration by including only a small region
of the affected cortical slices (see Materials and Methods).
The MMP-9 levels were significantly higher compared
with those observed in the contralateral side of the lesion
(Fig. 1B), whereas the MMP-2 levels in ipsilateral and
contralateral sides of the lesions did not differ significantly
(Fig. 2B). However, the MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels in
lesioned brains were markedly enhanced compared with
those in sham-operated animals or in age-matched control
animals (no surgeries performed; Figs. 1B, 2B, see summary
bar charts).
Next, we determined whether minocycline treatments
would prevent MMP upregulation in the lesion
site. We predicted that minocycline treatment would
reduce MMP production, but we also determined
whether administration of the drug 2 hr before inducing
the lesion would alter the levels of MMP production. We
found that the enhancement of MMP-9 levels in salinetreated
animals was more consistently reduced by the
prior treatment with minocycline compared with administration
of the drug 1 hr after the lesion (Fig. 1C). In
contrast, MMP-2 elevation in saline-treated rats was significantly
reduced only by pretreatments of animals with
minocycline (Fig. 2C). We included a sham-operated
group in these experiments (n54 for MMP-9 groups
[Fig. 1C] and n56 for MMP-2 groups [Fig. 2C]) to confirm
that saline treatments (vehicle controls for the minocycline
treatments; Figs. 1C, 2C) or lesioned animals
without saline injections (Figs. 1B, 2B) still induced similar
MMP-9 and MMP-2 elevations. We also noted that
the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 with minocycline pretreatments
did not differ significantly from the sham levels
(Figs. 1C, 2C), suggesting that this anti-inflammatory
drug may have beneficial effects in reducing the extent of
damage in our small-vessel stroke model.
Microglial Cells Contribute to MMP Production in
the Lesion Site
The different population of glial cells implicated in
the early phase of cavity formation has not been previously
investigated. We hypothesized based on the abovedescribed
biochemical studies with minocycline that
microglial activation was responsible for the elevation of
MMP-9 and MMP-2 after the lesion. In sham control
brains, there was low level expression of MMP-2 in
GFAP-negative cells (Fig. 3Ai–Bi, column 2, see also column
5 zoom), which is consistent with the reported lowlevel
expression of endogenous MMPs in neurons (Ethell
and Ethell, 2007; Amantea et al., 2008; Huntley, 2012).
In contrast, the astrocytic marker GFAP showed a homogenous
distribution of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex
(Fig. 3. Ai, column 5 zoom). Also in sham animals, OX-
42 immunostaining revealed highly processed cells indicative
of resting microglia (Fig. 3. Bi, see column 5 zoom).
Levels of MMP-2, OX-42, and GFAP in control brains
(no surgery performed) were similar to those levels in
sham animals (data not shown). Two days after the lesion,
however, a marked increase in MMP-2-immunoreactive
punctae accumulated well inside the lesion areas (Fig. 3
Aiii, Bii, column 5 zoom) compared with areas around
the lesion border (Fig. 3. Aii, column 5 zoom). As shown
in Figure 3. Aiii (column 5 zoom), MMP-2 was enhanced
in the lesion site, but only few astrocytic processes
appeared to penetrate this damaged region. In contrast,
numerous astrocytes were found lining the lesion border
(Fig. 3. Aii, zoom column 5) and outside the lesion (Fig.
Fig. 2. Pial vessel disruption injury model increases MMP-2 protein
expression, an effect that is sensitive to minocycline administration. A:
In sham animals, the expression of MMP-2 (83 kDa) in 50 lg of 
cortical brain lysate (lane 3) was enriched when 500 lg brain lysate
was reacted with the immunoprecipitating MMP-2 antibody (lane 2)
but not with normal rabbit serum (lane 1; representative of three independent
experiments from different animals). B: Injury at the cortical
lesions induced significant elevation of MMP-2 compared with
sham-operated animals and control (no surgery) animals (nonparametric
one-way ANOVA, P50.0037). Numbers inside bar charts represent
the number of animals used for each treatment group.
Significances between groups from Dunn’s multiple-comparisons test
are denoted by the brackets above the bar charts, with *P<0.05,
**P<0.01, and NS P>0.05 (not significant). C: Compared with
saline treatments, minocycline significantly inhibited MMP-2 elevation
when applied before but not after the lesion (nonparametric ANOVA,
P50.0047). Number of animals used and significances between
groups are as indicated in the summary bar chart, with *P<0.05,
**P<0.01, and NS P>0.05. Molecular weights were estimated from
prestained protein standards. Bands shown in B and C represent
76-kDa active form and 83-kDa proform of MMP-2 (top blots)
and 37-kDa GAPDH (bottom blots). Values in B and C are
means6SD.

3. Aii,Aiii, column 1). Interestingly, some cells found
outside the lesion and near the lesion border showed endogenous
levels of intracellular MMP-2 (Fig. 3. Aii, columns
4 merge and 5 zoom), whereas in sham animals
these levels are barely detectable (Fig. 3. Ai,Bi, column 5
zoom). These cells are likely cortical neurons, insofar as
they stained with MAP-2 (data not shown). To avoid the
possible contribution of these cells to MMP-2 (and also
MMP-9) in subsequent imaging analyses (Figs. 4–8), we
obtained high-magnification images well inside the lesion
and toward the surface of the lesion (like those boxed
regions in Fig. 3. Aiii,Bii).
Next, we determined whether the lesion sites were
occupied by microglia/macrophages. The enhanced
MMP-2 levels within the lesion coincided with the
increase in population of cells immunopositive for OXFig.

increased numbers of microglia/macrophages in the lesion site (see
also Fig. 4, for MMP-9). Two days after sham surgeries, the MMP-2
(Ai and Bi, column 2) and OX-42 (Bi, column 1) immunoreactivities
were near background levels, whereas GFAP immunolabeling of
astrocytes showed normal localization of highly processed astrocytes in
the cortex (Ai, column 1 and see column 5 zoom of the boxed region
indicated in column 4 merge). Two days after inducing the lesion,
MMP-2 accumulated in the lesion site (Aii, Aiii, and Bii, column 2)
that is now populated by increased number of OX-42-positive cells
(Bii, compared with sham animals in Bi). The thin dotted lines indicate
the approximate borders of the lesions. Arrows denote the
location of cortical surfaces and the developing lesion sites populated
by microglia/macrophages. Note that, near the border region of
lesioned sites, astrocytes are abundant just outside the lesion (Aii and
Aiii, column 1) and are almost absent well inside the lesion (compare
Aii vs. Aiii, column 5). In contrast to GFAP staining, OX-42 immunostaining
is increased inside the lesion compared with outside the
lesion (Bii, column 1) or with sham animals (Bi, column 1). Well
inside the lesion (Aiii and Bii, column 5), MMP-2 punctate staining is
elevated. However, at the lesion border, there is less punctate MMP-2
staining (Aii vs. Aiii, column 5). Some cells outside the lesion border
have elevated intracellular MMP-2 staining (Aii, columns 4, 5). Scale

42 (Fig. 3. Bi,Bii, column 1 and column 5 zoom) and to
ED1 (see Fig. 4B). We also noted that the majority of
MMP-2 immunoreactivity was mostly extracellular (Fig.
3 Bii, column 5 zoom), but some intracellular colocalizations
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with either OX-42 or ED1
markers were observed at higher magnification when
z-stacked confocal images were combined (see Fig. 4,
colocalization seen as yellow in the merge channel).
To examine further the colocalization of cellular
markers with MMP-2 and MMP-9, a three-dimensional
maximum projection of the z-stacked images was
performed to reveal the cell types that are contributing to
the synthesis and release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 inside
the lesion (images obtained in areas similar to those boxed
regions in Fig. 3. Aiii,Bii). The three-dimensional images
show that few or no astrocytes colocalized with MMP-2
(Fig. 4A, top). There were no astrocytes with cell bodies
showing GFAP colabeling with MMP-2 inside the lesion
area, as evident in the merge channel (column 4). The
GFAP immunoreactivity in the lesion suggests the presence
of astrocytic processes that are still able to penetrate
the lesion site 2 days after the PVD injury, but these

collecting 18–20 z-stacked images at 0.06-lm pixel resolution and
superimposing them to create a three-dimensional view of colocalizing
particles (seen as yellow in the merge channels; see Materials and
Methods). No colocalization between GFAP and MMP-2 was
observed in the maximum projections of the z-stacked images (A, first
row). In contrast, colocalization of intracellular MMP-2 with either
OX-42 (A, second row) or ED1 (B, first row) markers was evident
using maximum projections. ED1 also colocalized with MMP-9 (B,
second row). Some MMP-2 punctae are clearly extracellular, because
they did not colocalize with ED1 or Hoechst stain (B, first row, see
puncta beside asterisk in column 4). Interestingly, some cells with
multilobulated nuclei strongly stained with MMP-9 but not with ED1
(B, second row, cell denoted by arrow). Most MMP-2 and MMP-9
are localized in extracellular spaces and not colocalized with ED1 or
OX-42 microglia/macrophage markers, thus resulting in negative
Pearson correlation coefficients (for values see Figs. 5 and 7 legends).

processes never colocalized with MMP-2. However,
MMP-2 did show colocalization with the microglia
markers OX-42 (Fig. 4A, bottom) and ED1 (Fig. 4B, top),
as shown by the maximum projections of the z-stacked
images. MMP-9 was also found to colocalize with ED1
(Fig. 4B, bottom). The majority of MMP-2- and MMP-9-
immunoreactive punctae appeared to lie in extracellular
space and did not colocalize with OX-42 or ED1. We also
found below that MMP-2 and MMP-9 elevation after the
lesion coincided with increased OX-42-immunoreactive
cells, suggesting that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
secreted by activated microglia/macrophages.
MMP-9 and MMP-2 in Lesion Sites Are
Extracellular and Decreased by Minocycline
Our biochemical findings revealed that the levels of
MMP-9 and MMP-2 were significantly reduced by
minocycline treatments before (for both MMP-2 and
MMP-9) and after (for MMP-9 only) inducing the injury,
so we next determined by using confocal images from
one confocal plane whether minocycline could reduce
the number and size of the MMP-9- and MMP-2-immunoreactive
punctae inside the lesion sites. We found that
saline treatments increased the density of MMP-9- and
MMP-2-immunoreactive punctae as well as OX-42-
immunolabeled cells in the lesion sites (Figs. 5, 7, second
row) and that minocycline administered before or after
the lesion was equally effective in reducing the density of
both MMP-9- and MMP-2-immunoreactive punctae and
OX-42-stained cells (Figs. 5, 7, rows 3, 4; summarized in
Figs. 6, 8). These imaging results support our biochemical
findings that MMP-9 and MMP-2 elevation in the lesion
sites was likely mediated by microglia/macrophage activation.
Surprisingly, the calculated Pearson correlation coefficients
for MMP-9 and OX-42 (see Fig. 5 legend for
Fig. 5. Minocycline decreased the deposition of MMP-9 into the
lesion space. In sham tissue (first row), MMP-9 levels are low, which
coincided with lower density of nuclear staining (column 3). With
saline injections following injury (second row), marked increase in
MMP-9 and OX-42 levels and increased cell densities were observed.
Minocycline administered before (third row) or after the lesion (fourth
row) significantly decreased MMP-9 levels (see also Fig. 6 for summary
). OX-42 and MMP-9 showed a low degree of colocalization.
The Pearson correlation coefficients for sham (100%) and other treatments
were calculated as follows: sham 20.32760.008

values) and for MMP-2 and OX-42 (see Fig. 7 legend for
values) were all negative for all treatments, indicating no
significant colocalization between MMP-2/9 and OX-42.
These negative Pearson coefficients reflect the high levels
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the extracellular space of
lesion sites and that the major forms of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 are expressed extracellularly outside the microglia
/marcrophages.
Minocycline and Batimastat, an MMP Inhibitor,
Both Prevent Fluid-Filled Cavity Formation at 21
Days Following PVD
We also tested the hypothesis that the cone-shaped
fluid-filled cavity observed 21 days post-PVD depended
on activation of extracellular MMPs. As we reported earlier
(Hua and Walz, 2006a) and confirmed in the present
study (Fig. 9A), a fluid-filled lacuna-like cavity bordered
by astrocytes was observed in saline-treated but not in
minocycline-treated rats. Daily injections of minocycline
for 5 days following PVD produced an effect similar to
that of administering the potent MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitor
batimastat (applied 2 hr before, 1 hr after, and 12
hr after PVD); that is, both treatments prevented the
formation of cone-shaped lacuna-like cavities. Instead,
this cavity now appeared to be populated by astrocytes
(Fig. 9B,C). These data are consistent with minocycline
acting to prevent MMP activation and/or secretion from
activated microglia, which is crucial for lacuna-like cavity
formation.
DISCUSSION
MMP-2 and -9 are by now well known to be involved in
remodeling of nervous tissue during normal events such
as learning and synaptogenesis (Wright et al., 2007) and
brain diseases involving inflammation-like processes such
as ischemia (Candelario-Jalil et al., 2009). They are zincdependent
proteases and are involved in the degradation
of basal lamina and extracellular matrix components such
as collagen IV. After a focal ischemic insult, the affected
brain parenchyma is being reorganized by a concerted
action of microglia and astrocytes (Planas et al., 2001).
MMP-2 and -9 are heavily involved in this extracellular
action and released mainly by microglia, astrocytes, and
neutrophils (Candelario-Jalil et al., 2009). Minocycline is
currently a well-known deactivator of microglia, affecting
indirectly the release of MMPs from this cell type in
Fig. 6. Particle analysis showed increased MMP-9-immunoreactive

general (Machado et al., 2006). However, minocycline
was also found specifically to inhibit MMP-9 (Ryan et al.,
2001). This study investigated a stroke model for smallvessel
disease that leads to lacuna-like infarcts. Despite its
high clinical impact, only few animal studies into smallvessel
disease have been undertaken and almost none on
lacunae formation.
The one feature that distinguishes lacunae in postmortem
analysis from other cavities or artifacts is their
capsular nature (Lammie, 2000). This is caused by the
walling-off of these fluid-filled cavities by reactive astrocytes
, which form a tight barrier around them. We developed
a model for small arterial vessel ischemia that leads
to lacuna-like cavitation, a hallmark for small-vessel
stroke: we find a fluid-filled space surrounded by a tight
encapsulation of reactive astrocytes. The model is based
on pial vessel stripping but using a smaller surface area and
interrupting only the medium-sized class II vessels, leaving
the large class I vessels intact. Whereas pial vessel
stripping leads to huge lesions, which extend into the corpus
callosum involving hemorrhage and therefore is more
reminiscent of brain trauma, this modified PVDII model
has a different outcome. The lesion is small (about 1
mm3) and cone-shaped, with the base on the pial surface
and the tip extending into the cerebral cortex but ending
well before the corpus callosum. There is no variation
and no hemorrhage. At first, 24 hr after injury, there is a
breach in the blood–brain barrier and a cavity (Wang and
Walz, 2003). Within the following 24 hr, the lesion is
again filled with cellular material, and MMP-2 and -9
expressions are already at their maximum and decline in
the following days (results not shown). We therefore
investigated only one time point 2 days after lesioning.
After an additional 14–21 days, the lesion always develops

into a fluid-filled cavity tightly encased by processes from
reactive astrocytes, a hallmark of lacunae. Small-vessel
stroke leads to lacunae, but it affects deeply penetrating
small arteries invading deeper nuclei. However, recent
MRI scans showed a certain amount of lacunae in the
cerebral cortex: the Cardiovascular Health Study found
8% (Price et al., 1997), the Rotterdam Scan Study 5%
(Vermeer et al., 2002), and the Framingham Offspring
Study 11% (Das et al., 2008) of all lacunae (silent infarcts)
in the cerebral cortex. These studies defined these silent
infarcts/lacunae as lesions with a certain volume and
roughly the same intensity as cerebrospinal fluid in both
CT and MRI scans. Thus they are fluid-filled cavities and
they were referred to as “silent cortical infarcts” (Das
et al., 2008). These cavities in the cerebral cortex are
obviously few and—taking into account the huge volume
of the cerebral cortex—exist in very low density. However
, the cellular mechanisms of cavities formed in grey
matter of deeper nuclei, where lacunae are clinically relevant
, seem to be similar in cerebral cortex, where their
low density of occurrence is unlikely to cause significant
pathology.
In our model, the application of minocycline within
1 hr after injury and given daily for only 6 days prevents
the formation of a cavity after 21 days. It leads instead to
scar tissue consisting completely of reactive astrocytes
with no apparent barrier toward the normal brain parenchyma
, like the one consisting of astrocyte processes
around the cavity. Our hypothesis is that overactivation
of microglia in these small-vessel strokes leads to an overproduction
of microglia and a decrease in astrocytes. Two
days after lesioning, the lesion is filled with activated
microglia, with astrocytes lining up around the periphery.
Normally the astrocytes do not invade and repopulate,
which might be the reason why this area develops into a
fluid-filled cavity with astrocytes relegated to the role of
sealing the cavity off from the normal parenchyma. In
animals treated with minocycline, the astrocytes invade
the lesioned area and turn it into a reactive gliotic area,
preventing a fluid-filled cavity. The molecular mechanism
of this event is not known. Here we focus on the possibility
that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are released excessively
from activated microglia and remodel the extracellular
space in a way that prevents astrocytic migration into it.

particles with increased total area after pial vessel injury. A: Immunofluorescence

MMP-9 especially has been directly linked to lacunar
infarctions in humans. Increased MMP-9 was found in
the serum of patients suffering from progressive lacunar
infarction (Kim et al., 2006) but not in those suffering
from the nonprogressive form. Increased MMP-2 was
also found in patients with lacunar strokes (Lucivero
et al., 2007), whereas MMP-9 was elevated only in more
severe forms of stroke. In animal models of stroke, both
MMP forms are upregulated and seem to have a deleterious
effect (Fatar et al., 2005). We therefore used this
PVDII model and minocycline to investigate MMP-2
and -9 expressions and roles in cavity formation.
From our immunofluorescence microscopy data, we
found a slight constitutive expression of both MMPs in
the cytoplasm of neurons in sham animals, which was upregulated
after the injury (Fig. 3. Aii vs. Ai). This expression
might account for the baseline protein content in the
Western blots. This seems to agree with reports in the literature
that find neuronal expression to various degrees of
both MMPs in sham animals and only negligible upregulation
after ischemia (Planas et al., 2001; Zhao et al.,
2006; Wright et al., 2007; Amantea et al., 2008). The
low-level expression in normal neurons fits also with
reports that MMP-2/MMP-9 activity is necessary for synaptogenesis
, dendritic spine stability, and maintenance of
long-term potentiation by interaction with synaptic
MMP substrates, including cadherins, BDNF/TrkB
receptors, ephrin-B2/EphB receptors, and laminin/integrins
(Ethell and Ethell, 2007; Wojtowicz and Mozrzymas,
2010; Huntley, 2012). However, the molecular mechanisms
involved in MMP-mediated impairments in learning
and memory after ischemic injury remain unclear.
Future studies are needed to determine whether increased
cytosolic expression of MMPs after ischemic insult is associated
with synaptic inhibition from stressed or dying
neurons, which could arise from cleavage of survival-associated
substrates (Pereira et al., 2005). Imaging analyses
also revealed upregulated MMPs in the cytosol of activated
microglia/macrophages (Fig. 4). Activated microglia
/macrophages are major sources of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-
a), so it remains to be established whether MMPs regulate
cytokine production and increased oxidative stress from
mitochondrial dysfunction after ischemic insult (Lovett

et al., 2012). However, ROS can directly activate transcription
factors, including nuclear factor-jB (NF- jB),
which can upregulate MMP-2 and MMP-9 during
inflammatory response of microglia (Arai et al., 2003; del
Zoppo et al., 2007).
Two days after ischemia we found a strong upregulation
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in Western blots. In
immunohistochemical analysis, this could be verified, but
the expression is restricted to punctate extracellular staining
in the lesioned area, which is dominated by microglia.
In the area peripheral to the lesion which on day 2 is filled
mostly with astrocytes, there is no detectable expression
of MMPs by immunohistochemical analysis. Thus we
conclude that by day 2 both MMPs are released by microglia
but not astrocytes. Because microglial cells dominate
almost exclusively the area of the lesion and prevent astrocytes
from entering this area in nonminocycline-treated
animals, this means that extracellular MMP concentrations
are relatively high within the lesion. The upregulation of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 2 days after focal ischemia has been
found by all authors (for review see del Zoppo et al.,
2007), although there are no animal studies on small-vessel
stroke and MMP-2 and -9. In the reperfusion model,
MMP-2 is increased transiently and early (Chang et al.,
2003). MMP-9 seems to be released later and in a more
sustained manner (Asahi et al., 2000). MMP-9 is also
more prominent in models with cerebral hemorrhage
rather than ischemic injury (McColl et al., 2010). However
, although most agree with a predominant release of
MMP-2 by microglia, there is considerable disagreement
on the cellular source of the extracellular MMP-9 after ischemia
in vivo, probably reflecting different animal and
stroke models (for review see Candelario-Jalil et al.,
2009). Some authors have found no release of MMP-9
from microglia (Zhao et al., 2006), whereas others have
(Planas et al., 2001). del Zoppo (2010) suggested that this
is due to different exposure of microglia to plasma proteins
, exposure to which will enhance MMP-9 production.
Thus animal models with increased microvascular
permeability will exhibit increased microglial MMP-9
release. This also explains the increased MMP-9 release in
hemorrhagic stroke types. Our present findings indicate
that microglial cells are the major source of both MMP-2
and MMP-9 in the ischemic lesion sites. One should
point out that our model is a small-arterial-vessel occlusion
model rather than a large-vessel ischemia model as
used by virtually all other authors.
Minocycline application either 2 hr before or 1 hr
after the PVD inhibits the increased release of MMP-2
and MMP-9 by microglia/macrophages in ischemic cortical
tissue. This is likely due to minocycline’s nonspecific
and well-known inhibitory (Dheen et al., 2007) effect on
microglia activation and not a direct inhibitory action on
MMP-9 (Ryan et al., 2001). If this effect were due to a
direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity, our antibodies
should still be able to detect the MMP molecules. This is
not the case, so it is likely that the MMP molecules are
not secreted by the microglia because of the suppression
of activation by minocycline. This was verified in
Western blots and immunohistochemical analysis with
double staining. Machado and coworkers (2006), employing
a 3-hr middle cerebral artery occlusion rat stroke
model and reperfusion found that minocycline inhibited
the enzymatic activity and protein expressions of MMP-2
and -9 in the ischemic brain hemispheres, but this study
did not address the cellular sources contributing to the
enhanced expression of MMPs. Minocycline treatment
has been shown to be a well-known suppressor of inflammation
and microglial activation (Hailer, 2008), so our
results obtained with the focal PVD cortical ischemia
model suggest that minocycline inhibits the release of
microglia/macrophage-derived MMP-2 and MMP-9 into
the extracellular space. The two forms of MMP appear to
be released in this model into the lesion exclusively by
microglia/macrophages during a critical phase of cavitation.
This would be the time when astrocytes would
repopulate the lesion, but this is prevented by microglia.
Is the action of either MMP-2 or MMP-9 or both preventing
astrocytic migration? Normally, MMPs are
released to facilitate migration of cells. Our results showed
that the MMP inhibitor batimastat (Wojtowicz-Praga
et al., 1996; Yrjanheikki et al., 1998; Wharton et al.,
2000) mimicked the effects of minocycline in preventing
lacuna-like cavity formation. Batimastat is a specific inhibitor
of MMPs, but within the MMP family it has a
broad spectrum: 3 nM for MMP-1, 4 nM for MMP-2
and MMP-9, 6 nM for MMP-7, and 20 nM for MMP-3
(Aparicio et al., 1999). We do not know the batimastat
concentration in the brain extracellular space in our
experiments. However, it is likely that MMP-2 and
MMP-9, which are the major MMPs involved in ischemia
and are shown to be suppressed by minocycline treatment
, are the major targets. However, we cannot exclude
other MMPs. This suggests that microglia/macrophage
secretion of MMPs in our PVD model of small-vessel
stroke plays a crucial role in cavity formation, and minocycline
acts mainly through inhibition of MMP-2 and -9.
