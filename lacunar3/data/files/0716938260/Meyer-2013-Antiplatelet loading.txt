Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the 
only Food and Drug Administration–approved therapy 
for ischemic stroke.1 Human studies have shown improved 
stroke outcome with acute antiplatelet loading, with no significant
risk of hemorrhage.2–4 The purpose of this proofof-concept
study was to evaluate dose-related efficacy of 
acute antiplatelet loading on stroke outcome by comparing 
the following: (1) standard treatment of aspirin (ASA; 5 
mg/kg), (2) usual dose dual antiplatelet loading (UD; ASA 
10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg clopidogrel), and (3) high-dose dual 
antiplatelet loading (HD; ASA 10 mg/kg+30 mg/kg clopidogrel
). Coprimary end points were (1) platelet inhibition 
and (2) behavioral outcome as measured by the P
50
 (milligrams
of clot that leads to neurological dysfunction in 50% 
of animals in a group) 24 hours after stroke in the rabbit 
small clot embolic stroke model.
Methods
This was a blinded, randomized, controlled study in the rabbit small 
clot embolic stroke model with male 2 to 4 kg, 1-year old, New 
Zealand white rabbits (n=60). All sterile surgical, embolization, 
histological, and behavioral outcome procedures were based on 
the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model techniques of Zivin and 
Lapchak.5–7 The University of California Los Angeles and Veterans 
Administration San Diego Health System Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committees approved the surgical and treatment procedures.
Animals (20 per group) were randomized to (1) ASA, (2) UD, 
or (3) HD 2 hours after embolization. The time of drug administration
was adjusted to the time at which recombinant tissue-type 
plasminogen activator administration is no longer Food and Drug 
Administration approved as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke 
(3 hours after stroke in humans, which is the equivalent of 2 hours 
after embolization in rabbits).8 Care was used throughout the study 
to minimize pain and discomfort. Rabbits were euthanized if they 
showed extreme discomfort or were unable to reach food or water.
For platelet inhibition, blood was collected at prestroke baseline, 
hour 3, hour 6, and hour 24 after drug administration and tested in 
response to ADP, arachidonic acid, and collagen-induced aggregations
(2.5 µmol/L, 250 µmol/L, and 12 µg/mL, respectively) via a 
Chrono-Log aggregometer.9 Platelet inhibition was reported as 
percent decrease from baseline. The P
50
 was used as the behavioral 
outcome. Neurologically normal animals have no deficits, and abnormal
animals have ≥1 deficits. Sample sizes were selected to provide
80% power at a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 with ANOVA 
and t test. Post hoc multiple comparison used a Dunnett T3 for nonequal
variances.
Results
There were no statistically significant differences among 
the groups with respect to age, weight, surgical time, body 
temperature during surgery, or clot weight. One animal died 
Background and Purpose—No approved acute therapy exists for thousands of patients with ischemic stroke who present 
ineligible for thrombolytics. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the efficacy of acute antiplatelet 
loading on stroke outcome in the rabbit small clot embolic model.
Methods—Sixty male New Zealand white rabbits were embolized via small clots into the middle cerebral artery. Two 
hours later, animals were treated with (1) aspirin (5 mg/kg; n=20); (2) usual dual antiplatelet loading (aspirin 10 mg/
kg+clopidogrel 10 mg/kg; n=20); or (3) high-dose dual antiplatelet loading (aspirin 10 mg/kg+clopidogrel 30 mg/kg; 
n=20). The coprimary outcomes were as follows: (1) platelet inhibition and (2) behavioral outcome as measured by the 
P
50
 (milligrams of clot that leads to neurological dysfunction in 50% of animals in a group).
Results—There was a significant difference in 3-hour arachidonic acid and ADP (P<0.011); 6-hour collagen and ADP 
(P<0.01, P<0.01); and 24-hour collagen, arachidonic acid, and ADP (P=0.02, P<0.01, P<0.01) platelet inhibition. The 
behavioral outcome was significantly better in the usual dual antiplatelet loading versus aspirin group (P=0.02).
Conclusions—This study suggests that usual dual antiplatelet loading is clinically beneficial in a validated model of acute 
stroke. Study of usual dual antiplatelet loading in acute stroke is warranted to provide treatment to stroke victims ineligible 
for current therapies. (Stroke. 2013;44:3246-3248.)

after embolization but before treatment and was replaced 
in the study.
ANOVA showed significant difference between groups in 
3-hour arachidonic acid and ADP inhibition (F=4.8, P=0.01; 
F=245.2, P<0.01); 6-hour collagen and ADP inhibition 
(F=18.2, P<0.01; F=1601.5, P<0.01); and 24-hour collagen
, arachidonic acid, and ADP inhibition (F=4.4, P=0.02; 
F=29.9, P<0.01; F=5,014.6, P<0.01). Variances were found to 
be unequal among the groups. Post hoc analysis of response to 
collagen, arachidonic acid, and ADP is displayed in the Table.
The P50 for the incidence of behavioral deficits was significantly 
higher in the UD versus ASA group (6.10±1.5 versus 2.73±1.73 
mg; P=0.028) but not in the UD versus HD group (6.10±1.5 versus 
5.8±1.38 mg; P=0.47) or the ASA versus HD group (2.73±1.73 
versus 5.8±1.38 mg; P=0.24; Figure). The level of platelet inhibition
was not correlated with P
50
 outcome (P=0.38).
Discussion
The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the 
dose-related efficacy of acute antiplatelet loading in an ischemic 
stroke model. This is the first nonrodent study of acute antiplatelet
loading for the treatment of ischemic stroke and showed that 
antiplatelet loading significantly decreased platelet aggregation 
and resulted in better behavioral outcome than ASA alone.
HD loading showed a benefit in platelet inhibition but provided
no additional behavioral benefit. Perhaps, factors other 
than platelet inhibition alone limit additional improvements 
in behavioral outcome. Furthermore, a potential for increased 
hemorrhage or other toxic effect could have occurred in the 
HD group. It was not possible to assess for intracranial hemorrhage
in this model; however, future work will assess this. 
Also, a small effect size between the UD and HD could require 
a larger sample size to detect differences.
Limitations do exist. First, mechanism of action was not 
assessed. Second, young, healthy animals may not reflect clinical
practice. Third, this model examined dual antiplatelet loading
in small clot embolic strokes. The recent Clopidogrel in 
High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular 
Events (CHANCE) study and ongoing Platelet-Oriented 
Inhibition in New TIA and minor ischemic stroke (POINT) 
study examine patient populations reflective of this model. 
Dual antiplatelet loading treatment must be examined in models
of large artery occlusion to warrant translational study 
in a wider patient population. Finally, the lack of placebotreated
and clopidogrel-only–treated groups did not allow for 
the comparison with a true control group. These groups were 
not included, given the proof-of-concept study nature of the 
study. In clinical practice, patients with stroke receive ASA 
within 48 hours of transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke 
as a standard of care based on American Stroke Association 
guidelines.10 Here, ASA alone served as an active control to 
reflect clinical practice. Evaluation of the clopidogrel-only

ASA indicates aspirin; HD, high-dose dual antiplatelet loading; and UD, usual dose dual antiplatelet loading.
*Statistically significant.
†Because the ASA group was not treated with an ADP receptor blocker, there was no ADP platelet inhibition 
seen from baseline at 3, 6, or 24 h.

groups would allow for testing of the hypothesis that the outcome
benefit seen was because of dual antiplatelet loading and 
not just clopidogrel alone. With feasibility established, future 
studies will include these groups.
Conclusions
This study provides support for acute antiplatelet therapy 
treatment of ischemic stroke. This widely available, inexpensive
therapy has the potential to improve patient outcome after 
ischemic stroke in millions of people for whom no approved, 
acute treatment currently exists.
