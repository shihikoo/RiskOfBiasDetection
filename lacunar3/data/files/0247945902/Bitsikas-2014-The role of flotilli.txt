Abstract
Flotillin 1 and flotillin 2 associate in the plasma membrane to form microdomains that have roles in cell signaling, regulation
of cell-cell contacts, membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, and endocytosis. They are thought to be involved in the trafficking
and hence processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, APP. In this study we set out to obtain in vivo confirmation of a link
between flotillins and cleavage of APP to release amyloidogenic Ab peptide, and to generate tools that would allow us to
ask whether flotillins are functionally redundant. We used a mouse model for Ab-dependent cerebral amyloidosis, APPPS1
mice, combined with deletion of either flotillin 1 singly, or flotillin 1 and flotillin 2 together. There was a small but significant
reduction in Ab levels, and the abundance of congo-red stained plaques, in brains of 12 week old mice lacking flotillin 1.A
similar reduction in Ab levels was observed in the flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double knockouts. We did not observe large effects
on the clustering or endocytosis of APP in flotillin 1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We conclude that flotillins are likely to
play some role in APP trafficking or processing, but the relevant cellular mechanisms require more investigation. The
availability of flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- mice, which have no overt phenotypes, will facilitate research into flotillin function in
vivo.

Introduction
Proteolysis of the single pass trans-membrane protein APP
(Amyloid Precursor Protein) leads to the generation of Ab (beta
amyloid), a 40 or 42 amino acid peptide that is the main
constituent of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of people
with Alzheimer’s disease [1]. Sequential cleavage of APP by beta
and gamma secretases generates the Ab peptide, while the
cleavage product of alpha and gamma secretases is not amyloidogenic.
How the activities of the alpha, beta and gamma secretases
are regulated spatially and temporally, and hence the amount of
Ab produced, are not completely understood (this large literature
is reviewed in [1–3]). It is likely, however, that endocytosis and
sub-cellular trafficking of APP contributes to its differential
processing [4].
Flotillins are palmitoylated and myristoylated proteins that
associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [5–7].
There are 2 flotillin paralogues in metazoans, flotillin 1 and 2.
Association and oligomerisation of flotillin 1 and 2 leads to the
formation of plasma membrane puncta, or microdomains, with a
defined size [8,9]. Both flotillins are required for formation of these
structures [9,10]. The function of flotillin microdomains is not fully
understood, but they are likely to be important for linking the
plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton [10–12], for signaling
events [13,14], for regulating cell-cell adhesion [15], and for
membrane traffic during endocytosis [5].
Several observations link flotillins to APP trafficking. Flotillins
accumulate in the endosomal system of neurons from a transgenic
mouse model of amyloid plaque formation, and in the brains of
humans with Alzheimer’s disease [16,17]. Increased Ab production
, moreover, causes intracellular accumulation of Abin flotillinpositive
endosomes [18]. The intracellular domain of APP has
been reported to bind to flotillins, and flotillins and APP may both
bind to a common partner, LGI3 (leucine rich glioma inactivated
3) [19,20]. Importantly, siRNA mediated knockdown of flotillin 2
impairs the endocytosis of APP, alters the nanometer-scale
clustering of APP in the plasma membrane, and reduces Ab
production in tissue culture cell models [21]. One outstanding
question relates to whether there is redundancy between the
flotillins in terms of a functional relationship with APP, as different
studies report a role for flotillin 1, and others flotillin 2 [19,21].
In this study we have investigated the role of flotillin 1 in APP
trafficking and processing. We have used cells from flotillin 1
knockout mice to determine whether endocytosis or plasma
membrane clustering of APP is affected by the complete absence of
the flotillin 1 protein. We have assayed the in vivorole of flotillins in
Ab production, comparing both the amount of Ab and the
abundance of plaques in brains of a transgenic mouse model for
Ab plaque formation (APPPS1 mice, which overexpress human
APPswe and L166P mutant presenilin 1 [22]), in the presence and
absence of the flotillin 1 gene. We find that in vivo there is a small
but reproducible reduction in Ab accumulation and hence plaque

formation in the absence of flotillin 1. We tested whether there is
functional redundancy between flotillin 1 and flotillin 2 in vivo by
generating flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double knockout mice. The
amount of Ab in flotillin 1-/- single knockouts and flotillin 1-/-,
flotillin 2-/- double knockouts expressing the APPPS1 transgenes is
the same. Our data confirm that flotillins are likely to have some
link to the trafficking or processing of APP, and that the absence of
one flotillin is unlikely to be compensated by the presence of the
other flotillin protein, suggesting that flotillins probably form a
complex to exert their function. However, the precise mechanism
by which flotillins affect APP processing is still unclear.
Results
We carried out experiments to determine whether flotillin 1 has
a role in endocytosis of APP. MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts)
were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-APPswe (In all
experiments we used a GFP-tagged version of the Swedish
mutation of APP [23]). GFP is present on the extracellular
domain of the protein. Endocytosis assays were based on flow
cytometry analysis, thereby allowing measurement in high
numbers of cells with a wide range of expression levels. When
transfected cells were incubated with fluorescent anti-GFP
antibodies on ice, only a small amount of antibody bound to the
cells, consistent with low levels of full length APPswe at the plasma
membrane, as APPswe is rapidly cleaved by secretases after
exocytosis [4,24]. Upon incubation at 37uC, however, the amount
of antibody present in the cells progressively increased in
transfected cells, but did not change in cells not expressing
APPswe (Figure 1A). This specific and temperature dependent
increase in signal is likely to reflect internalisation of antibody
bound to GFP-APPswe. Consistent with this, confocal microscopy
revealed that after incubation with anti-GFP antibodies at 37uC
the antibody co-localised with GFP-APPswe in apparently
intracellular, endosomal compartments of transfected cells
(Figure 1B), but was not present in un-transfected cells. A clear
positive correlation between the amount of overexpressed APP
and the amount of antibody accumulating in the cells was evident
in the flow cytometry data (Figure 1A). When the amount of
antibody accumulation in control and flotillin 1-/- cells was
quantified and compared, using FACS as in Figure 1A, there was a
slight but significant reduction in the flotillin 1-/- cells (Figure 1C).
The small magnitude of this effect could reflect an indirect role for
flotillin 1 in APP endocytosis or intracellular trafficking.
In order to further investigate the relationship between flotillin 1
and APP endocytosis and trafficking, we carried out co-localisation
experiments. Flotillin 1 did not co-localise to any significant extent
with GFP-APPswe at the plasma membrane, when imaged using
TIR (total internal reflection) illumination (Figure 2A). This,
coupled with the small size of the effect of flotillin 1 deletion on
APP uptake, argues against direct internalisation of APP in flotillin
microdomains. Indeed, APP has previously been shown to be
internalised via clathrin-coated pits [4,24], and extensive colocalisation
between GFP-APPswe and clathrin was observed
(Figure 2B). It is possible that flotillins could act as some kind of
specialized adaptor for specific recruitment of some cargoes to
coated pits [5]. However, co-localisation between flotillins and
clathrin was much less extensive than between GFP-APPswe and
clathrin (Figure 2C), so it is unlikely that flotillins recruit APP to
coated pits.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of flotillin 2 has been reported to
perturb the clustering of APP in the plasma membrane [21]. We
used PALM (photo-activation localisation microscopy [25]) during
TIR illumination to determine the distribution of APP at the
plasma membrane in flotillin 1-/- MEFs, and MEFs from congenic
control mice. For visualisation of APP clusters we tagged the
extracellular part of APPswe with monomeric EOS2 fluorescent
protein [26]. As predicted by previous studies [24], mEOS2-
APPswe was found in clusters at the plasma membrane, and we
were able to resolve clusters as small as 30 nm in diameter
(Figure 2D). There was, however, no difference detected in the size
of these clusters between flotillin 1-/- and control cells (Figure 2E).
Therefore neither co-localisation, nor super-resolution imaging
data suggest a specific mechanism by which flotillin 1 could be
involved in APP traffic.
Aiming to explore the potential relationship between flotillin 1
and APP transport and processing in a more physiologically
relevant system, we turned to in vivo experiments. APPPS1 mice,
which coexpress the Swedish mutation of APP and L166P mutated
presenilin 1, provide a tractable model for APP-dependent
amyloidogenesis, developing Ab plaques from 6–8 weeks after
birth [22]. We crossed APPPS1 mice with flotillin 1-/- mice.
Western blots of brain extracts using the 6E10 monoclonal against
APP confirmed that full length human APP is expressed in the
resultant mouse strains in equal amouts (Figure 3A). However, in
these blots, the abundance of APP cleavage products varied from
individual to individual (Figure 3A), and no clear difference
between control and flotillin 1-/- mice was observed. As Western
blotting did not yield clear-cut results, we elected to assay Ablevels
in control and flotillin 1 knockout mice quantitatively using ELISA
(enzyme linked immuno-absorbent assay), using commercial
reagents for detection of the two different forms of Ab of 40 and
42 amino acids [27]. Brain hemisphere extracts from 12 week old
mice were prepared by homogenization and a 20,000 g spin (the
supernatant from which was used to assay soluble Ab), followed by
extraction of Ab from the pellet with 70% formic acid (formic acid
solubilizes aggregated Ab present mostly in amyloid plaques [28]).
The amount of soluble 40 and 42 amino acid Ab measured in
brains from flotillin 1-/- mice was consistently less than that found
in congenic controls (Figure 3B). The same effect was observed
when formic acid extracted Ab was assayed, although in this case
the data were more variable (Figure 3C). These data demonstrate
that flotillin 1 is likely to have an effect on Ab levels, and hence
potentially APP processing, in vivo.
In order to provide confirmation that flotillin 1 is involved in
formation of Ab plaques, we used Congo Red staining of 25 mm
coronal sections of frozen brain hemispheres from flotillin 1-/-
mice and congenic controls (Figure 4A). Congo Red is a
metachromatic anionic dye that stains insoluble protein deposits,
like amyloid plaques [29]. Quantification of the area of each
section covered by plaques, in around 25 sections from each of 10
control and 10 knockout mice, revealed a significant decrease in
plaque formation in the flotillin 1 knockouts to 76% of that
measured in the controls (Figure 4B). Therefore both use of Congo
Red to stain plaques and ELISA assays for Abaccumulation imply
that flotillin 1 has a role in regulating cleavage of APP and hence
amyloid plaque formation in vivo.
One limitation of the experiments described thus far in this
study is that flotillin 2 could compensate for the absence of flotillin
1. It has been reported that flotillin 2 has a more significant effect
on APP endocytosis than flotillin 1 [21]. These experiments used
siRNA depletion and it may be hard to compare the efficiency of
functional depletion for different targets. Aiming to resolve these
issues, and to ask whether there is redundancy between flotillin 1
and flotillin 2, we produced flotillin 2 knockout mice, using
appropriately targeted embryonic stem cells from the Knockout
Mouse Project (www.komp.org). Absence of flotillin 2 expression
in these mice was confirmed by PCR (Figure 5A), and by Western

blotting (Figure 5B). After back-crossing the flotillin 2-/- mice with
C57Bl/6J mice for 4 generations, they were crossed with flotillin
1-/- mice to produce homozygous double knockouts, flotillin 1-/-,
flotillin 2-/-. The double knockouts showed no gross or obvious
abnormalities compared with congenic controls or either single
knockout. In flotillin 1 knockouts flotillin 2 expression was reduced,
and residual flotillin 2 was no longer concentrated in membrane
microdomains [10]. In flotillin 2knockouts flotillin 1 expression was
less than 15% of control levels (Figure 5B), and in the double
knockouts neither protein could be detected, as one would expect
(Figure 5B).
After crossing the flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- mice with APPPS1,
soluble and formic-acid extractable Ablevels in the brain of 12 week
old animals were assayed by ELISA exactly as previously. Again,
there was a reduction in both pools of Ab(Figure 5C, Figure 5D). In
the case of formic acid extracted Ab, variability in the data was too

account for variable expression levels, APP uptake was calculated as the ratio of median Alexa555 fluorescence (anti-GFP) over median GFP
fluorescence, after gating for GFP-positive cells as shown by the black line overlaid in A. This ratio was normalised so that the mean of the control
values equalled 1, to allow comparison of different experiments. Data from 5 separate flow cytometry experiments are shown. Bars are SEM.

high to support the conclusion that this reduction was statistically
significant, but the trend of reduced Ab was apparent in all cases.
Importantly, there was no significant difference between Ablevels in
the flotillin 1-/- mice and the double knockouts (compare Figure 3
and Figure 5: when Ab levels in flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double
knockout and flotillin 1-/- mice were compared with each other,
using Students T test, no significant difference was detected).
Therefore there is no functional redundancy between flotillin 1 and
flotillin 2, at least in terms of Ab production.
Discussion
Crossing of APPPS1 mice with flotillin 1-/- and flotillin 1-/-,
flotillin 2-/- knockout mice has allowed us to provide evidence that
flotillins are likely to be involved in some way in the regulation of
APP processing and hence Ab production. In brain from flotillin
1-/- and flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- mice expressing the APPPS1
transgenes we observed less Ab and less amyloid plaques, as
compared with controls. The magnitude of the reduction was,
however, relatively small. We must, therefore, consider the
possibility that flotillins are not directly involved in APP trafficking
per se, but rather have some homeostatic role in a separate cellular
process that impacts indirectly on Ab production. The fact that
our experiments on APP traffic and clustering in flotillin 1knockout
MEFs did not reveal any strong phenotype is consistent with this
idea.
Further experiments that address the molecular basis for flotillin
function in different cellular processes are clearly needed. It is also
possible that in the APPPS1 mouse, where Ab production is being
driven at high rates by ectopic expression of human APP and PS1
[22], the effects of deletion of flotillin genes are not the same as
they would be in more physiological contexts. Therefore our
results, although suggestive, should not be interpreted as
completely ruling out an important or direct role for flotillins in
APP traffic.
The issue of whether flotillins 1 and 2 are co-dependent in their
cellular functions, or whether they can also function individually,
has been unclear. There are several reports in the literature of
siRNA experiments where knockdown of one flotillin, but not the
other, has an effect [7,13,21,30,31]. On the other hand, both
flotillins are required for formation of characteristic punctate
membrane microdomains, and the large majority of both proteins
is present in the protein complexes which define these microdomains
[5,8,9,11,12]. Both flotillins have been found to be
expressed at constant levels across 16 different human tissues,
suggesting that the composition of the complexes should be
uniform in all tissues [32]{Eisenberg, 2013 #453}{Eisenberg,
2013 #453}{Eisenberg, 2013 #453}. Our quantitative data on
Ab production allows us to state that, at least in this case, the
phenotype of flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double knockouts is no more
severe than observed in flotillin 1-/- mice, so it is unlikely that the
flotillin 2 protein present in the flotillin 1-/- mice is functioning in
processes relevant to Ab production.
The establishment of flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double knockout
mice will provide a powerful model system for investigating flotillin
function without the complicating factor of potential functional
redundancy between flotillins.
Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice
APPPS1 transgenic mice that co-express the Swedish mutation
of APP and L166P mutated presenilin [22] were kindly provided
by Michel Goedert and Isabel Lavenir (MRC-LMB). Flotillin 2
knockout mice were generated from Flot2 Gt(258D8)Cmhd
embryonic stem cells, produced by the Centre for Modeling
Human Disease, Toronto, and supplied by the Knockout Mouse
Project (www.KOMP.org). In these cells, GFP is inserted at the
flotillin 2 locus, and GFP is expressed at low levels in flotillin 2-/-
mice. Primers used for genotyping were: PUPA5B, GAA GCG
AGA AGC GAA CTG ATT; FA2, CTT GGA AGA ATG ATG
CTG TTG C; and RB4: GAG AAA GTT AGA CAT AGA

Constructs and antibodies
APP695 was a gift from Paul Matthews (CDR, Orangeburg).
The Swedish mutation (K595N/M596L) was generated using sitedirected
mutagenesis. The N-terminal tagging of APP was
obtained by introducing the fluorescent protein (GFP or mEos2)
in the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain of APP as previously
described [33].
Mouse monoclonal antibodies against flotillin 1 and 2 (BD) were
used as described previously[10]. Monoclonal antibodies against
amyloid beta (6E10), clathrin heavy chain (X22) and tubulin alpha
(AbD Serotec) were used.
Cell culture
HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in
DMEM containing 10% FCS at 37uC, 10% CO2.
Microscopy and internalisation assays
For microscopy, cells were transfected with FugeneHD
(Promega), in media without Phenol red, 14–20 hours before
imaging. Cells were fixed and permeabilised with either 4%
parafolmadehyde in PBS followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 or with
methanol at220uC.
Internalisation of fluorescent transferrin (Invitrogen) or anti-
GFP antibody (Invitrogen) were carried out in DMEM without
serum at 37uC for the indicated times. Control cells were labeled
for the same length of time on ice.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated using the Coloc2
plugin for Image J. Images were manually adjusted to set
background signal to zero, and to set maximal pixel intensity to
similar values using the auto brightness and contrast function of
Image J.
Super-resolution microscopy and cluster size
determination
For Photoactivation Localisation Microscopy (PALM) [34],
Lab-TekTM II chambered coverglass (Nunc) was coated with
fibronectin (2 mg/ml in PBS) (Sigma Aldrich). The following day
MEFs immortalised by transfection with SV40 T were seeded at a
density of 66103 cells/cm2 and 24 h later they were transiently
transfected. Approximately 16 hours after transfection, cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. TIRPALM
imaging was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope
with a 606 1.49NA objective (Olympus, ApoN) and an Evolve
EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Activation by the 405 nm laser
and excitation by the 561 nm laser were taking place at the same
time. In order to distinguish photoconversion of individual
molecules, the intensity of the 561 nm laser was maintained at a
high level so that fluorophores would bleach within seconds after
photoconversion. Typically, nonphotoconverted molecules were
exhausted after 10000 frames. Centroids were assigned with the
QuickPALM plugin for Fiji. The reconstructed image was then
used to measure the size of the APP clusters at the plasma
membrane.
ELISA and amyloid plaque quantification
Brain tissues were harvested when mice reached the age of 12
weeks. The cerebellum and the olfactory bulbs were removed, and
then the brain hemispheres were separated and individually
frozen. The right hemisphere was always used for ELISA, while
the left hemisphere was always used for imaging and quantification
of amyloid plaques.
Brain Ab levels from snap-frozen hemispheres were determined
using Human Amyloid b40 and Amyloid b42 Brain ELISA
(Millipore). Soluble Ab was present in the supernatant after
homogenization and 10 minutes centrifugation at 20,000 rcf.
Insoluble Ab, mostly in amyloid plaques, was extracted by the
addition of 70% formic acid (FA) to the pellet and subsequent
sonication, followed by neutralization with 1M Tris pH 7.4.
For the quantification of amyloid plaques, brain hemispheres
were frozen in O.C.T. cryoprotectant compound. Subsequently,
25 mm-thick coronal sections were taken every 250 mm on a Leica
CM3050S cryostat-microtome. This procedure generated approximately
25 slices from a single hemisphere. The sections were left
to dry overnight and the following day were stained with Congo
Red (Sigma Aldrich). Images were acquired on a Leica MZFLIII
stereo microscope using the mCherry filter. Images of individual
slices were then analyzed in batch with ImageJ to determine the
area of amyloid plaques relative to the size of every slice.
