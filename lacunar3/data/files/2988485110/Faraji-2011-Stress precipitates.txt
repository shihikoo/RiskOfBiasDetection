Stress has been linked to structuraland functional outcomes after stroke. Moreover,the striatum, both dorsaland
ventral, isa vital regulatorofstressperceptionand associatedphysiological responses.This study investigates potential
synergistic effects of focal stroke in the ventrolateral striatum and restraint stress on motor and spatial
performance. Adult male Long–Evans rats were pre-trained in a skilled reaching task and randomly assigned
to sham, stroke-only,stress-only and stroke+stress conditions. Ventrolateral striatalfocal ischemia was induced
by endothelin-1 (ET-1) infusion. Rats in stress-only and stroke+stress groups received 21 days of mild restraint
stress after stroke. All rats were tested in the skilled reaching task and the ziggurat task (ZT) for post-stroke
motor and spatial performance. There was no effect of ventrolateral striatal ischemia or stress alone on motor
and spatial performance. Notably, stroke and stress interacted synergistically to reduce reaching success and
to disrupt qualitative aspects of movement performance in the absence of histological differences in lesion
size. Thus, stress can precipitate behavioural deficits after focal ischemia even in the absence of significant functional
deficits on its own. These results emphasize the importance of prevention programmes to control poststroke
levels of stress in clinical populations.

Introduction
Psychological stress has been linked to a wide range of complications
in neuropathological conditions (Metz, 2007; Kim and Kim,
2007; Craig et al., 2008; Merrett et al., 2010). Specifically, stress can
have a major impact on acute brain insults such as stroke in both
humans (Baune and Aljeesh, 2006; Wilz and Kalytta, 2008; Tsutsumi
et al., 2009; Jood et al., 2009; Hilari et al., 2010; Kornerup et al., 2010)
and nonhuman animals (DeVries et al., 2001; Sugo et al., 2002; Weil
et al., 2008; Kirkland et al., 2008; Caso et al., 2008; Faraji et al.,
2011b). The stress-induced complications in animal models of stroke
concern both motor and memory performance after cortical and
sub-cortical (mostly hippocampal) lesions. For example, chronic restraint
in rats may delay recovery following focal ischemic lesion in
sensorimotor cortex (Kirkland et al., 2008) and exaggerate spatial
learning and memory deficits in the Morris water task (MWT) in
rats with hippocampal ischemic infarct (McDonald et al., 2008).
Similarly, restraint stress prior to hippocampal focal stroke attenuates
post-stroke performance in the ziggurat task (ZT), a dry-land
task for spatial learning (Faraji et al., 2011b).
Whether outcome is adversely affected by stressful experiences,
however, is not fully investigated in the context of striatal stroke.
Both dorsal and ventral striatum assist in the control of stress responses
and regulate their psychophysiological consequences (Robbins,
2005). Thus, damage to the striatum may disturb the central processes
of stress control and enhance its adverse psychological and
physiological effects.
Regionally selective striatal lesions, predominantly to its dorsal
portion, have been linked to behavioral deficits (Dunnett and Iversen,
1981, 1982; Viaud and White, 1989; Reading et al., 1991; Döbrössy et
al., 1996; Thullier et al., 1996; Eagle et al., 1999; Featherstone and
McDonald, 2005a,b). These studies indicate distinct roles for the medial
and lateral portions of the dorsal striatum in spatial and motor
behaviors (Whishaw et al., 1987; Colombo et al., 1989; Devan et al.,
1996, 1999; De Leonibus et al., 2007; Castañé et al., 2010; Yin, 2010;
see also White, 2009 for review).
Although previous studies suggested behavioral dissociations following
lesions in the ventral striatum (Cousins and Salamone, 1996a,
b; Lindner et al., 1997; Park and Thornhill, 2000) it is not clear whether
spatial and motor deficits are evident after lesions in the ventral subregions
of the striatum. More importantly, very little is known about
the possible contribution of psychological stress in spatial memory
and motor impairments after ventrolateral striatal stroke.
In the present study, using an animal model of ischemic focal
stroke and a sensitive test battery of skilled forelimb use and spatial
performance we show that these functions are not influenced by ventrolateral
striatal stroke or restraint stress alone. However, exposure
to restraint stress following ventrolateral striatal stroke produces

the synergy between ventrolateral striatal stroke and stress does not
have a significant impact on spatial performance.
Material and methods
Subjects
Twenty-two adult male Long–Evans rats, weighing 380–420 g at the
beginning of the experiment, raised at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural
Neuroscience Vivarium at the University of Lethbridge, were
used. The animals were housed in pairs under a 12:12 h light/dark
cycle with light starting at07:30 h and temperature set at22 °C. All testing
and training were performed during the light phase of the cycle at
the same time of day. The animals received water ad libitum.Animals
were food-restricted one week prior to baseline training, and maintained
at about 90% of their initial body weight throughout the experiment.
Rats were given an additional amount of food in their home
cage at least 4 h after completion of the behavioral training and testing.
Because animals were housed in pairs, they were weighed daily
throughout the experiment in order to monitor their food consumption.
Each rat was handled forfive consecutive days prior to any experimental
manipulation. All procedures were performed under protocols approved
by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Lethbridge
in compliance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care.
Experimental design
The rats were trained in skilled forelimb reaching task for 28 days in
order to establish a reliable baseline for limb preference before surgery.
Once their performance reached a plateau after 4 weeks of pre-stroke
training, the animals' performance was video recorded for qualitative
movement analysis (Metz and Whishaw, 2000). Animals were then
randomly assigned to the following groups: sham (N=6), stroke-only
(N=5), stress-only (N=6) and stroke+stress (N=5). Animals
assigned to the striatal stroke groups (stroke-only, stroke+stress) received
an endothelin-1(ET-1) injection into the ventrolateral striatum
on the side contralateral to the paw preferred for reaching. The sham
group received all surgical procedures except the ET-1 infusion. The
stress group only received post-stroke stress treatment.
Blood samples were taken after surgery from all groups one day prior
to the stress treatment (baseline). Stress-only and stroke+stress groups
received restraint stressfor 21 days. Blood samples were also taken from
all groups on day 21 of treatment (chronic time point). All groups were
tested in the skilled forelimb reaching and in the Ziggurat tasks for
post-stroke and stress measurements. Animals were euthanized after
all behavioral assessments for histological analysis of lesion extent and
location.
Skilled reaching task
Assessments of skilled reaching were based on earlier descriptions
(Whishaw et al., 1986; Metz and Whishaw, 2000). Each training and
test session required the rats to reach for 20 food pellets. Baseline training
was considered complete once the success rates reached asymptotic
levels. At particular time points, the rats' reaching performance was
video recorded from a frontal view using a digital camcorder (Canon
ZR70 MC) at 25 fps with a shutter speed of 1/500. The tapes were analyzed
frame-by-frame on a Sony DV player. Quantitative analysis included
percentage of successes and reaching attempts. A successful
reach was defined as obtaining the pellet on the first attempt, withdrawing
thepaw with thepellet through theslit and releasingthe pellet
into the mouth. Percent reaching success was calculated by counting
the number of successful reaches divided by the number of pellets
(20) given in each session multiplied by 100. Moreover, an attempt
was defined as a repeated forelimb movement towards the pellet and
obtaining the pellet after more than one reach (Metz et al., 2005).
Qualitative movement analysis of limb movements was performed
for the first three successful reaches for each limb. Eleven reaching
movement components [(1) Orient,(2)Limb lift,(3)Digits close,(4)
Aim,(5)Advance,(6)Digits open,(7)Pronation,(8)Grasp,(9)Supination
1,(10)Supination 2, and (11) Release] and 35 subcomponents were
scored according to earlier descriptions (Whishaw et al., 1993; Metz
and Whishaw, 2000). Each movement component was rated on a
three-point scale: 0 point, movement absent; 0.5 point, the movement
is present but abnormal; 1 point, the movement is normal.
ET-1-induced focal ischemia
The stroke-only and stroke+stress groups received unilateral intrastriatal
ET-1 infusion. Briefly, three injections of ET-1 (175 pmol; 0.5 μl;
0.1 μl/min) were made into the ventrolateral striatum on the side contralateral
to the paw preferred for reaching. ET-1 was delivered through a
23-gauge cannula attached to a Harvard infusion pump (model 22) at
the following coordinates; AP:+1.6,+0.5,−0.8; ML: ±3.40, ±4.10,
±5; DV:−6.40,−6.60,−6.80 in millimeters relative to bregma. The
cannula was left in place for 4 min after each injection to allow for ET-1
diffusion. The scalp was sutured after surgery and the recovery of the animals
was monitored. Post-surgical care included the administration of
buprenorphine HCl (0.05 mg/kg) as an analgesic. Sham animals received
all surgical procedures except skull trephination and ET-1 infusions. Skull
trephination was not performed in sham-operated animals because it has
been previously reported to produce behavioral and neurochemical
asymmetries (Adams et al., 1994). Rats were allowed to recover for 2–
3 days before the beginning of post-stroke manipulations.
Blood samples and restraint stress
Blood samples
All procedures for blood sampling and restraint stress were similar
to those reported by Faraji et al. (2009). Blood samples were taken at
baseline (the day prior to stress treatment) and 15–20 min after restraint
on day 21 of daily stress. All samples were collected in the
morning hours. Rats were transported individually to the surgical
suite and anesthetized with 4% isoflurane. During the 2–3 min of anesthesia
, 0.6 mL of blood was collected from the tail vein. Blood was
sampled using a heparinized butterfly catheter. Blood samples were
transferred to centrifuge tubes and plasma was obtained by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The plasma samples were stored at−20°C
until analyzed for corticosterone (CORT) levels using commercial radioimmunoassay
kits (Coat-A-Count, Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los
Angeles, USA).
Restraint stress
The stress-only and stroke+stress animals were exposed to restraint
stress for 21 consecutive days. Each day, animals were placed
in transparent Plexiglas tubes (6 cm inner diameter) of adjustable
length, from 10:00 am to 11:00 am. The tubes maintained animals
in a standing position without compression of the body while allowing
ventilation through perforated ends of the tube.
Spatial performance in the ziggurat task (ZT)
In order to assess spatial performance of the animals, all rats were
tested in the standard version of the ziggurat task (ZT), a dry-land
task for spatial cognition (Faraji et al., 2009, 2010). The training and
testing procedures of the ZT to assess spatial performance were previously
described in detail (Faraji et al., 2008). Briefly, the testing sessions
were conducted over 9 consecutive days. The cycle consisted of alternating different-goal or learning days (odd days or days 1, 3, 5, 7) and
same-goal or memory days (even days or days 2, 4, 6, 8). On the odd

days, the goal ziggurats were located in a new location, and rats had to
findand learnthe location of thegoalzigguratin thenew place. Thegoal
ziggurats remained in the same place on the even days. Thus, the rats
were required to remember the location they had learned previously.
Two sets of ziggurats were defined in the environment. First,“start”
ziggurats, located in eachcorner,and second, theremainingziggurats or
“goal”ziggurats. On the testing days, the rats, released from each starting
point, were allowed to explore the environment. One goal ziggurat
(peripheral or central) was baited with spaghetti for each trial. During
each testing day, the exploration took place in eight trials per rat and
at four different starting points at a randomized position. Across trials,
the starting location varied among the four corners of the apparatus,
and on each trial, animals navigated in the environment for 70 s or
until they found the goal ziggurat and consumed the food. Since the location
of the goal ziggurat remained constant from trial to trial every two
days, the rats had to learn and remember the new locations of the goal
ziggurat following each two days. In order to minimize olfactory cues,
both the box and ziggurats were cleaned with 5% alcohol after testing.
Probe trial-dependent behaviors in the ZT were measured on the
ninth day as an additional measure for spatial memory performance.
The percentage of time rats spent in trial two in each quadrant of the
ziggurat task was recorded.
The movements of the animals including latency or time spent to
find the goal ziggurat, path speed and percentage of time spent in
each quadrant on probe trials within the ZT were recorded and analyzed
by a video tracking system (HVS Image 2020, UK) and an Acer
computer (Travel Mate 225X). It should be pointed out that because latency
and path length consistently reveal similar profiles of spatial navigation
within wet- and dry-land tasks (Vorhees et al., 2004; Kapoor et
al., 2009; Harrison et al., 2009; Faraji et al., 2010), we have considered
and reported only latency and path speed in the ZT.
Histology
All animals were sacrificed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital
(300 mg/kg i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 0.9% phosphate buffered
saline (PBS; 200 mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA;
200 mL). Brainswere removed, post-fixed for 24 h in 4% PFA, and stored
in 30% sucrose-formalin solution for cryo-protection until they were
sectioned on a cryostat microtome at a thickness of 40μm. Every fourth
section was mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet. The
stained sections were examined under a microscope (Zeiss, Germany)
and images were captured using an AxioCam camera (Zeiss, Germany)
to quantify lesion extent.
The extent of striatal damage in each stroke rat was calculated. In this
experiment,five images were captured under 1× magnification, corresponding
approximately to 2.20, 1.20, 0.48,−0.30 and−0.92 mm relative
to bregma. A systematic sampling grid with an area per point of
20,000 pixels was randomly projected on each image and the number
of points hitting intact striatal tissue was counted. Grids were generated
using ImageJ software. The total number of hits in each rat was then
divided by the average number of hits obtained by three control rats.
The complement proportion was used as the percentage striatal lesion
estimate.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows 11.5.0
(Standard Version, 1982–2002; SPSS Inc., USA). The results were subject
to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures across testing
sessions within both memory andmotor tasks. Specifically, three behavioral
indices within the ZT (i.e. latency, path speed and percentage of
time spent in target quadrant on the probe trial day) were averaged and
analyzed for each odd (learning) and even (memory) day. Repeated
measures analysis of variance was conducted for ZT with Group
(sham, stroke-only, stress-only, stroke+stress), Day (days 1–8), Trial
(trials 1–8) for the independent measures. All daily latencies and path
speed values are the mean values of the eight trials. Latency, speed
and percent time spent in the target quadrant served as the dependent
variables. Moreover, percent success, reaching attempts, and total and
detailed movement scores in skilled reaching were analyzed as dependent
variables for post-stroke motor alterations. Post-hoc (Tukey HSD)
test was used for both memory and motor measures to adjust for
multiple comparisons. In addition to the behavioral measures, for
all histological data, the differences in between-group and withingroup
comparisons were assessed with independent and dependent
sample t-tests, with Pb0.05 set as the significance level. All data are
presented as mean±standard error of the mean.
Results
Restraint stress does not affect the extent of ET-1-induced tissue loss in
the ventrolateral striatum
The ET-1 injection resulted in tissue loss limited to the striatum in all
stroke animals.Fig. 1(ABC) illustrates a representative ventrolateral striatal
lesion in three rostrocaudal coronal sections at 1.60 mm, 0.20 mm, and
−0.80 mm from bregma, and a coronal section of the striatum in a
stroke rat (Fig. 1D). The damage to the ventrolateral striatum was pronounced
in all rats. No noticeable damage was found in the claustrum
and dorsal endopiriform nucleus in stroke animals. No detectable tissue
damage was observed in SHAM and STRESS-only groups. An analysis
performed on the percent tissue loss in the striatum using volumetrics
showed no significant difference between STROKE-only and STROKE+
STRESS groups (17.61% ±0.97 vs. 19.04.58% ±1.22; PN0.58). This
suggests that post-stroke restraint stress did not have any reliable
impact on the structural outcomes induced by ET-1 injection into
the ventrolateral striatum.
Chronic restraint stress elevates plasma CORT
There was no significant effect of Group for plasma CORT at the prestress
time point (SHAM: 284±33.12 ng/mL; STROKE-only: 266±

time point (SHAM: 303±47.22 ng/mL; STROKE-only: 292±

effect [F(3,18)=5.11,Pb0.041; ANOVA] indicating that the 21-days
restraint stress paradigm used in this experiment enhanced plasma
CORT in both STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS groups. No significant
difference was found between the STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS
groups for plasma CORT at the post-stress point (397±50.39 ng/mL vs.
429±57.81 ng/mL,PN0.63,post hoc). In addition, a comparison between
pre- and post-stress points for STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS
groups indicated that the restraint stress significantly enhanced
plasma CORT in both groups [STRESS-only: t=2.29; STROKE+
STRESS: t=1.83, both Pb0.05; dependent sample t-test].
Synergy between stroke and stress does not alter spatial performance
Latency
Latency or time spent tofind the goal ziggurat in the standard version
of the ZT (Fig. 2A) was assessed.Fig. 2(B) shows the mean latencies
across eight testing trials in the ZT. In addition, panel C in Fig. 2
depicts latency for all groups over the acquisition (learning) and retrieving
(memory) days. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed
with group, testing days and trials as independent variables, and latency
to find the goal ziggurat over 64 trials of the ZT testing as the
dependent variable. Our analysis showed no significant difference between
groups [F(3,18)=0.591,PN0.05] indicating that spatial performance
in the ZT was not affected by ventrolateral striatal ischemic
stroke, restraint stress and even stroke combined with stress. Furthermore
, ANOVA conducted for latency on learning and memory
days showed a significant difference between learning and memory
days [F(1,18)=34.51, Pb0.05] suggesting that all groups, regardless
of their experimental condition spent less time tofind the goal ziggurat
on memory days compared to learning days (Fig. 2C). No interaction
was found between Group and Day (PN0.05).
Path speed
Because latency can be potentially affected by differences in path
speed and, more importantly, both stress and ischemia-induced hyperactivity
have previously been reported (Strekalova et al., 2005;
Plamondon et al., 2008), path speed, in addition to latency, was considered
within the ZT. All four groups showed relatively constant speeds
across the 8 testing days in the ZT. No significant main effect of Group in
terms of path speed (SHAM: 0.128±0.019 mt/s, STROKE-only: 0.133±
0.049 mt/s, STRESS-only: 0.134±0.049 mt/s, STROKE+STRESS: 0.129±
0.016 mt/s; PN0.86, ANOVA) was found in the task, supporting the idea
that neither of the experimental manipulations (i.e. stroke, stress, and
stroke+stress) in the current study had a major impact upon the animals'
speed during spatial performance in the ZT.
Probe trial
The percentage of time spent in the target and opposite quadrants
(quadrant 3 vs. quadrant 1) of the ZT during the probe trial (day 9th)
is depicted inFig. 2(D). Analysis of the 60 s of the probe performance
in the ZT revealed that all groups spent a considerable proportion of
their time searching in the target quadrant. A repeated measures
ANOVA conducted for the percentage of the time spent in the target
quadrant (SHAM: 37.26%±3.82%, STROKE-only: 48.50%±4.18%,
STRESS-only: 38.83%±3.82%, STROKE+STRESS: 40.74%±4.18%)
showed no significant effect of Group [F(3,18)=0.328, PN0.05] indicating
that all experimental groups could remember the previous

location of the goal ziggurat. Furthermore, animals in all groups
showed significant savings for the target quadrant (quadrant 3) relative
to the opposite quadrant (quadrant 1, SHAM: t=4.08; STROKE-
only: t=3.64; STRESS-only: t=4.91, STROKE+STRESS: t=4.22; all
Pb0.05, dependent samples t-test). In summary, all rats tended to
preferentially navigate in the quadrant in which the goal ziggurat
had been presented during the previous training days.
Stroke and stress synergistically diminish skilled reaching performance
Quantitative assessment (success rates and reaching attempts)
Rats' motor behavior was assessed by the skilled reaching task
(Fig. 3A) in which animals were required to reach and retrieve food
pellets with the forelimb contralateral to the striatal lesion. No significant
difference between the groups in percent success was found
during pre-stroke sessions [F(3,19)=2.75, PN0.05; ANOVA]. As illustrated
in Fig. 3(B), the improvement in success rate in the pre-stroke
trials from days 1 to 28 (SHAM: 20.58 vs. 58.33; STROKE-only: 22.00
vs. 57.00; STRESS-only: 24.16 vs. 68.33; STROKE+STRESS: 29.16 vs.
54.16) indicated that all experimental groups were able to improve
their reaching skills as the training was proceeded.
Reaching success rates in the post-stroke sessions, in contrast,
revealed a different profile of motor behavior in the experimental
groups. As can be seen in Fig. 3(B), rats in SHAM, STROKE-only and
STRESS-only groups were able to show significant spontaneous improvement
compared to the STROKE+STRESS group. A significant
main effect of Group was observed in terms of success present in
the post-stroke trialF(3,18)=8.42,Pb0.05; ANOVA). Success percent
in the STROKE+STRESS group was significantly different from STRESS-
only, STROKE-only andSHAM animals (allPb0.05;post-hocTukey HSD).
The profile of changes in reaching success for the STROKE+STRESS
group showed that this group was less successful on days 6 through
17 of post-stroke sessions. The average reaching success from day one
to day 17 of post-stroke trials for all groups indicated that SHAM animals
were considerably more able to improve their reaching than STROKE-
only and STRESS-only groups (SHAM: 35.83 vs. 62.50; STROKE-only:
17.00 vs. 48.00; STRESS-only: 21.66 vs. 44.16), but no significant differences
were found between these groups (all PN0.05; post-hoc Tukey
HSD).
Furthermore, a comparison between pre- and post-stroke success
percent showed that only SHAM animals reached higher success rates
on post-stroke sessions indicating that the experimental manipulations
(i.e. stroke and stress) in the present study prevented reaching
improvement in the STROKE-only, STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS
groups. This effect, however, only was significant in STROKE+STRESS
rats (t=2.67, Pb0.05; dependent samples t-test, Fig. 3C) suggesting
that the rats' reaching success after stroke only was affected by the synergy
between stroke and stress.
There were no significant differences in the number of reaching
attempts between the four groups on the last day (day 27) of prestroke
trials (SHAM: 62±3.92, STROKE-only: 64±3.32, STRESS-
only: 70±4.26, STROKE+STRESS: 67±4.17; PN0.05). An analysis
conducted for post-stroke reaching attempts, however, revealed a significant main effect of Group [F(3,18)=8.05, Pb0.05; ANOVA]. No significant difference was observed between SHAM and STROKE-only
groups (53±4.16 vs. 58±5.49; PN0.05, post-hoc Tukey HSD) at the
post-stroke time point.Post-hocanalysis also indicated a significant difference
between these two groups and STRESS-only and STROKE+
STRESS groups (allPb0.05) suggesting that the latter groups performed
more reaching attempts than the SHAM and STROKE-only groups. In
addition, while both STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS groups had increased
reaching attempts in post-stroke trials (STRESS-only: 83±5.33,

STROKE+STRESS: 79±4.21), no significant difference was observed
between these groups (PN0.05, post-hoc Tukey HSD). This indicates
that reaching attempts in rats with mere stress and stroke+stress
were equally affected by restraint stress. Furthermore, within-group
comparisons between pre- and post-stroke trials revealed that only
SHAM animals performed significantly fewer reaching attempts during
the post-stroke period (62±3.92 vs. 53±4.16; t=9.42, Pb0.05; dependent
samples t-test). The STROKE-only group performed fewer reaching
attempts in the post-stroke period, but dependent samples t-test for
pre- and post-stroke comparison showed no significant difference
between trials (64±3.32 vs. 58±5.49; t=12.67, Pb0.05). In contrast
, both STRESS-only and STROKE+STRESS groups showed increased
attempts during post-stroke trials compared to pre-stroke
period (STRESS-only: 70±4.26 vs. 83±5.33; t=10.72; STROKE+
STRESS: 67±4.17 vs. 79± 4.21; t=8.40, both Pb0.05; dependent
samples t-test).
Qualitative assessment (total and individual movement scores)
Fig. 4(A and B) compares movement performance in the skilled
reaching task prior to and after stroke. Both total and individual movement
scores were considered as qualitative measures for skilled limb
use. There was no significant difference between groups at the pre-stroke
time point [F(3,19)=1.97, PN0.05; ANOVA]. However, analysis for poststroke
reaching performance indicated a significant main effect of Group
[F(3,18)=3.20, Pb0.05; ANOVA] in which only the STROKE+STRESS
group had an overall significantly lower 35-point qualitative score
when compared to STRESS-only, STROKE-only and SHAM groups
(all Psb0.05, post-hoc Tukey HSD; Fig. 4Aa). Furthermore, animals
in the STROKE+STRESS group had remarkably, but not significantly
, lower movement scores at the post-stroke sessions when
compared to pre-stroke sessions (19.26±2.43 vs. 27.44±1.00).
In addition, analysis of 11 reaching components at pre- and poststroke
time points indicated a similar profile in performance after stroke
and stress. As illustrated inFig. 4A, there was no overall Group difference
in thereachingcomponents at thepre-stroke timepoints. The difference
between groups in terms of movement components at the post-stroke
time point (Fig. 4B), however, was significant [F(3,18)=5.22, Pb0.05;
ANOVA]. The STROKE+STRESS group showed significantly reduced
movement scores when compared to STRESS-only, STROKE-only and
SHAM groups (all Psb0.05; post-hoc Tukey HSD). This effect may have
originated from the lower scores in four reaching sub-components observed
only in the STROKE+STRESS animals. At the post-stroke time
point, rats in the STROKE+STRESS group had significantly lower
Grasp, Supination I, Supination II and Release scores when compared
to other experimental groups (all Psb0.05, post-hoc Tukey HSD; Fig. 4B
a,b,c,d). These findings indicate that rats in the STROKE+STRESS
group required more integrated movements of digits and paws to withdraw
the pellets through the slot as well as more extensive head and
body movements to extract the pellet from the paw (Fig. 5). Compensatory
adjustments included an angular body position during reaching

assessed by a detailed 35-point scale before and after stroke for all groups. Rats with stroke and stress had lower total reaching scores in post-stroke trial when compared to
other groups. Panel B compares groups in 11 reaching components. Stroke+stress rats had significantly lower scores in grasp, supinations I and II, and release. Frames abcd

movements, as indicated inFig. 5, upper panel. The largest deviation in
body positioning was found in three out of 5 STROKE+STRESS animals,
which was likely linked to the larger impairments in reaching movement
performance.
Discussion
The morphological results of this study indicate that the intrastriatal
injection of ET-1 was ischemic in nature, arguably, due to its prolonged
and marked vasoconstrictive effects. Skilled reaching and
spatial behaviors remained unaffected by either ventrolateral striatal
focal ischemia alone or chronic stress alone. The combination of
stroke and stress detrimentally influenced skilled limb use. Interestingly
, neither the lesion volume nor spatial performance was affected
by the synergistic effects of stroke and stress.
ET-1-induced stroke: applied aspects in animal studies
In animal stroke models, focal ischemia can be produced by ET-1,
an endogenous potent and long-acting vasoconstricting peptide
(Yanagisawa et al., 1988) injected directly into the brain tissue. Previous
studies have established the usefulness of ET-1 for inducing focal
ischemia in the forelimb motor region of the cortex (Windle et al.,
2006), the dorsal frontoparietal cortex (Fuxe et al., 1997), the hippocampus
(Mateffyova et al., 2006; Driscoll et al., 2008; Tsenov et al.,
2007; McDonald et al., 2008; Spanswick et al., 2009; Faraji et al.,
2011a), sensorimotor cortex (SMC; Adkins-Muir and Jones, 2003;
Allred and Jones, 2004; Adkins et al., 2004), and striatum (Fuxe et al.,
1992; Ottani et al., 2003; Windle et al., 2006; Peeling et al., 2006; Clarke
et al., 2009). The stereotaxic intracerebral injection of ET-1 involves
simpler surgical techniques with less post-surgical complications
(Sharkey et al., 1993; Sharkey and Butcher, 1995). Because blood
flow reduction in the ET-1 model of ischemic stroke is rapid, but not immediate
(Macrae et al., 1993) and reperfusion occurs over several hours
(Biernaskie et al., 2001; Macrae et al., 1993), this neuropathological profile may be more representative of human stroke than the immediate
reduction and reperfusion seen with other animal models of ischemic
stroke. Therefore, ischemia following ET-1 delivery resembles vital clinical
aspects of vasospasm in the affected tissue.
Striatal lesions and behavioral consequences
Striatal stroke was chosen in the present study because the striatum is
a key structure for integrating and relaying information in different modalities
(e.g. sensorimotor, emotional, cognitive) from distributed areas
of associative cortices, ultimately downstream motor areas (Alexander
et al., 1986). Furthermore, as a sub-cortical site of the forebrain, this structure
is critical in the pathophysiology of degenerative (Whishaw et al.,
1986; Faraji and Metz, 2007; Eckart et al., 2010) and non-degenerative
(Fuxe et al., 1992; Castañé et al., 2010) brain disorders. In this context,
both cognitive and motor deficits have been reported after damage to
the dorsal striatum in rats (Garside et al., 1996; Chang et al., 1999;
Devan et al., 1999; MacLellan et al., 2006; Döbrössy and Dunnett, 2006;
Haelewyn et al., 2007). While lesions in the dorsolateral striatum can disrupt
sensorimotor function and simple stimulus response learning (Dunnett
and Iversen, 1982; Reading et al., 1991; Yin, 2010), damage to the
dorsomedial striatum has been shown to produce impairments in spatial
cognition (Colombo et al., 1989; McGeorge and Faull, 1989).

In contrast to the anatomical results, the behavioral outcome, either
motor or spatial, after unilateral focal lesion in ventrolateral striatum is
poorly described. Stroke-only animals in our study showed no deficit in
skilled reaching or spatial performance. The results not only confirm the
functional heterogeneity within the neostriatum of the rats (Dunnett
and Iversen, 1982; see alsoWhite, 2009for review), they also indicate
that the function of the ventrolateral striatum is not comparable to
the adjacent dorsolateral striatum within which damage induces sensorimotor
deterioration.
One of the unique features of the present results is the nature of
focal structural damage. Because the ET-1-induced stroke was localized
and restricted to the ventrolateral striatum, the behavioral outcomes
reported in this study may reveal a better picture of the
involvement of this sub-region of the neostriatum in skilled reaching
behavior and spatial performance. Hence, the absence of sensorimotor
and spatial deficit suggests a profile of striatal contribution in
rats in which neither skilled limb use nor spatial performance critically
depend on ventrolateral striatal circuitry.
Post-stroke functional outcomes induced by stress: precipitating or
inhibitory effects?
It is generally believed that psychological stress is a critical influence
on performance and disease (Sugo et al., 2002; Metz, 2007; Smith et al.,
2008; McDonald et al., 2008). Our results showed that restraint stress
had no impact upon the extent of the stroke-induced tissue loss. The silent
structural consequences of restraint stress may represent an alternative
picture of the involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA)-related outputs in the structural recovery after stroke when compared
to previous reports (Caso et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2008; Kirkland
et al., 2008; Zucchi et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2010). This discrepancy may be
due to differences between the stressprotocol, the model used for ischemic
damage, and the location and extent of the lesions.
Stress-induced worsening of behavioral impairment, in the absence
of any gross morphological changes following ventrolateral striatal
stroke, highlights the effects of aversive experiences on functional improvement.
Stroke+stress rats in the present study showed substantial
movement deficits in the skilled reaching task starting from day six. This
was reflected by both reduced reaching success and diminished movement
scores. Both stress-only and stroke+stress groups also showed
increased post-stroke attempts confirming previous reports (Metz et
al., 2001, 2005) in which stress led to frantic reaching movements and
reduced accuracy. Although the present examinations were based on a
sensitive task of skilled movement, one may expect that synergistic effects
of stress and stroke would also extend to other striatal motor functions
(Cousins and Salamone, 1996a; Eagle et al., 1999; Tillerson et al.,
2001).
Several mechanisms could account for the devastating behavioral
consequences of post-stroke psychological stress. First, because stress
is generally associated with high emotionality such as frustration,
anxiety and fear (seeLupien et al., 2009for review), stress-associated
emotional changes may influence motor control. This may potentially
uncover or precipitate motor dysfunctions, in particular those of delicate
skilled movements.
Furthermore, stress may exert inhibitory effects in which normal
responses (e.g. recovery and/or compensation processes) become
suppressed. Any suppressive consequences of stress may obstruct behavioral
recovery and/or behavioral compensation processes. One
could assume that the reduced reaching performance after poststroke
day 6 may be caused by delayed inhibitory behavioral or pathophysiological
effects of restraint stress that prevents spontaneous
motor improvement. In this context, both stress-induced impediment
of compensatory limb use (deficits in compensatory adjustments)
and suppressive effects of psychological stress on motivation or hedonic
responses (Smith et al., 2008) should be considered.
Further support for the possibility of stress-associated motor disturbance
is provided by the notion that the striatum, in addition to
its involvement in goal-directed behaviors (Hollerman et al., 2000),
serves as a crucial site for relaying stress information to forebrain
structures (Robbins, 2005). One potential consequence of a focal
damage of dorsal or ventral striatum in a stressed animal is likely a
dysregulation in the central processing of stress-related information.
Thus, striatal ischemic stroke and chronic restraint stress may exert
synergistic effects on motor control that become noticeable in sensitive
skilled movement tasks.
Concluding remarks
The synergy between focal stroke and stress on striatal motor control
leads to a number of assumptions. First, stress may precipitate behavioral
deficits after a focal ischemia or any vascular event that alone
are not associated with observable functional deficits. This may become
a key issue in particularly mini- or silent strokes where symptoms
occur transiently or do not present clinically. Second, stress
may inhibit the structural and/or behavioral mechanisms mediating
functional improvement after focal ischemia. In this perspective,
HPA axis activation possibly exerts suppressive effects on post-stroke
recovery via glucocorticoid signaling as previously hypothesized
(Sapolsky et al., 1986). Although it seems unjustified to define a stress
state based on only HPA axis hyperactivity or elevated plasma CORT,
more focus on related neuro-hormonal modulation of stroke recovery
may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of motor dysfunctions
after stroke and improved rehabilitation therapies. This
knowledge can also help to identify therapeutic targets for stressrelated
complications after stroke.
