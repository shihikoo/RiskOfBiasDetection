Abstract
Introduction: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. The
progressive remodeling of brain microvessels due to arterial hypertension or other vascular risk factors causes
subtle, but constant cognitive decline through to manifest dementia and substantially increases the risk for stroke.
Preliminary evidence suggests the contribution of the immune system to disease initiation and progression, but a
more detailed understanding is impaired by the unavailability of appropriate animal models. Here, we introduce the
spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model for early onset cSVD and unveiled substantial immune changes in
conjunction with brain abnormalities that resemble clinical findings.
Results: In contrast to age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, male SHR exhibited non-spatial memory
deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain atrophy and a reduction of white matter volumes in SHR.
Histological analyses confirmed white matter demyelination and unveiled a circumscribed blood brain barrier
dysfunction in conjunction with micro- and macrogliosis in deep cortical regions. Flow cytometry and histological
analyses further revealed substantial disparities in cerebral CD45high leukocyte counts and distribution patterns
between SHR and WKY. SHR showed lower counts of T cells in the choroid plexus and meningeal spaces as
well as decreased interleukin-10 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the other hand, both T and NK cells were
significantly augmented in the SHR brain microvasculature.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that SHR share behavioral and neuropathological characteristics with human
cSVD patients and further undergird the relevance of immune responses for the initiation and progression of
cSVD.

Introduction
Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) has rapidly gained
attention as a growing medical and socioeconomic burden.
It is supposed to cause about one fifth of strokes worldwide
[1] and more than doubles the risk for a recurrent attack
[2]. Furthermore, progressive white matter damage relates
to substantial cognitive decline, thus being held
responsible for almost half of dementias among the elderly
population [3].
Considering its enormous impact, surprisingly little is
known about the pathogenesis of cSVD. Low mortality
certainly contributes to this lack of knowledge as post
mortem studies in patients reveal late-stage tissue alterations
rather than incipient steps of the disease cascade
[4]. Neuroimaging is currently the gold standard to
assess cSVD, but only captures tissue changes secondary
or even tertiary to the underlying pathology. Consequently
, there is a demand for animal models that allow
systematic investigation of the cellular and molecular basis
of cSVD, including the possibility to carry out preclinical
proof-of-concept trials.
Various relevant animal models of cSVD are described
in the literature, but it seems that they separately mimic
different aspects of human cSVD such as lacunar infarcts,
white matter damage or vessel dysfunction without covering
the entire pathophysiological cascade. Hereof, stroke
prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) feature
most of the cardinal histopathological signs of cSVD [5,6]
likely as a consequence of chronically increased arterial
blood pressure (BP) that causes vascular dysfunction
on a rodent time scale [7]. However, the SHR-SP model
is biased towards the bleeding facet of cSVD [8] which
might be due to genetically fixed alterations of the
endothelial tight junctions, being already evident in the
pre-hypertensive age of 5 weeks or less [9].
In human cSVD, bleedings and lacunar infarcts typically
occur in the basal ganglia while white matter hyperintensities
preferentially develop in the centrum semiovale. Anatomical
factors might explain these differing predilection
sites: arterioles entering the deep white matter from the
superficial cortex are coated by a single leptomeningeal
layer rendering them more susceptible to hypertensionrelated
vascular damage [4,10]. A recent cross-sectional
imaging study revealed that increased systolic BP progressively
disrupts white matter integrity already in
young adults [11]. A similar relation, however, has not
yet been described in animal models.
Several lines of evidence indicate that the immune system
significantly contributes to the development and progression
of cSVD. Serum levels of soluble adhesion molecules
were increased in patients with white matter lesions [12]
and blood monocytosis correlated with the incidence of
lacunar infarcts [13]. In 2005, a large population-based cohort
study unveiled that c-reactive protein (CRP) levels
correlate with the existence and progression of white 
matter damage [14]. The association of inflammation
and cSVD is not surprising since chronic inflammation
also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of its
primary risk factor hypertension [15]. However, whether
such inflammatory processes primarily initiate vascular remodeling
, secondarily promote its propagation, or simply
constitute a response to ongoing reorganization remains
unclear.
In this study, we investigated whether hypertension in
rodents triggers early changes of central brain regions
that resemble findings obtained from cSVD patients. For
this purpose, we took advantage of spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR) that, akin to their stroke-prone
relatives, develop arterial hypertension prior to the age
of 10 weeks, but have no disposition for spontaneous
cerebral hemorrhages. We found strong evidence that
SHR develop circumscribed blood brain barrier (BBB)
dysfunction, white matter damage and microglial activation
in their first third of life. Interestingly, we also found
substantial differences in the amount and distribution of
blood-born leukocytes in brains of SHR compared to agematched
normotensive controls. Thus, our results not
only suggest a relevance of SHR as a model for early-stage
hypertensive cSVD, but also indicate neuroinflammatory
contributions to the development of cSVD.
Material and methods
Animals
Animal experiments were approved by the local animal
welfare authority (Landesdirektion Sachsen, license number
TVV 06/13) and conducted according to the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by
the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No.
85? 23, revised 1996). A total of 16 male SHR and 16
Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY, both Charles River, Sulzfeld,
Germany) was used in this study and randomly assigned
to four experimental groups (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
After delivery, 11-week old animals were housed under
standardized conditions with free access to water and
food. Systolic BP was measured biweekly from week 12 to
22 by indirect tail-cuff method (ML125 NIBP, ADInstruments
, Oxford, UK). Pressure and pulse rate signals were
continuously recorded and digitalized using PowerLab
and LabChart software (both ADInstruments). Systolic
BP was determined as the mean of three cuff inflation
measurements.
Blood brain barrier integrity and blood vessel volume
FITC-lectin (1.6 mg/kg, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany)
and Evans Blue (EB, 2% in saline, 4 mL/kg, Sigma) were
injected into the tail vein of 24-week old rats (n = 3/3)
under inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane. Subsequently,
animals were sacrificed by an over-dose of ketamine and

transcardially perfused with 200 mL of phosphate buffered
solution (PBS). Brains were removed and shock-frozen in
isopentane at−65?C. Coronal brain sections of 30 μm(anterior
/posterior 1.32 to−5.04 mm relative to bregma) were
cut, mounted and fixated with 4% formalin solution for
15 min. Confocal stacks of six randomly selected sections
per animal were acquired using a LSM 710 confocal laser
scanning microscope (Laser: Diode 405, Argon 488, HeNe
543; Objective: Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 oil, Zeiss,
Jena, Germany). Red channel stacks (EB) were transformed
into maximum intensity projection images using
the FIJI image processing package (www.fiji.sc). The EB
positive area per ROI was determined for the whole
hemisphere and for the deep cortical region (DCR) adjacent
to the corpus callosum (CC). FITC-lectin stained
vessels were acquired in three ROIs (1536?1536?12 μm)
randomly placed among the DCR, and the total vessel volume
was assessed using the surface algorithm (absolute
intensity threshold: 20? 255; minimal volume: >100 voxels)
of Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland).
Behavioral tests
The novel object recognition test (NORT) was realized
in a noise and light-shielded acryl box (480?480 mm),
illuminated with 120 lux as described previously [16].
Briefly, 30-week old rats (n = 10/10) were allowed to habituate
to the arena and to the to-be-familiarized object
(cube) for 10 min on two consecutive days. Four hours
after the second habituation trial, rats were placed into
the arena, equipped with the familiar and the novel object
(cup) for 5 min. The discriminatory index was calculated
as following: interaction time with novel object divided by
total interaction time with both objects. Morris water
maze (MWM) was performed as reported earlier [17].
Briefly, a circular pool (diameter 180 cm, height 42 cm)
was filled with water (24 ? 2?C) to a height of 32 cm. The
pool was then divided into quadrants which were individually
branded by optical cues. A transparent escape
platform (diameter 10 cm) was placed 2 cm beneath the
water surface in the center of one quadrant. Starting
points were alternately set into the other quadrants. After
one day of habituation, maze performance of 34-week old
rats (n = 9/9) was investigated at three consecutive days.
Each day, two trials of maximally 90 sec with an inter-trial
delay of 30 sec were run. Whether successful or not, animals
were allowed to rest on the platform for 30 sec.
Video recorded experiments were analyzed using FIJI and
MTrack2 (valelab.ucsf.edu) tracking plugin. The time
needed (escape latency) and the distance covered to reach
the platform was assessed.
Magnetic resonance imaging
35-week old animals (n = 10/10) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg,
Merial, Hallbergmoos, Germany) and xylazine (10 mg/kg,
Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Measurements were performed
in a clinical 3.0 Tesla scanner (MAGNETOM
Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a
small loop radiofrequency coil (3 T Loop 4 cm, Siemens).
T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequences (T2-TSE) consisting
of 36 coronal slices of the brain (matrix: 224 ? 224;
field of view: 77 mm; slice thickness: 1 mm) were registered.
DICOM sequences were analyzed using FIJI. Total
brain volume, CC volume and volume of the ventricular
system were determined on binarized sequences obtained
by thresholding.
Sampling
35-week old SHR and WKY (n = 13/13) were sacrificed
by an over-dose of ketamine. Randomly selected rats
(n = 5/5) were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and the
head was flexed downward at 45 degree. A midline
scalp incision was made and the atlanto-occipital membrane
was exposed. A 27 G needle was inserted into the
cisterna magna for collection of 50? 100 μLcerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). CSF samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm
for 5 min and stored in aliquots at −80?C. Next, left cardiac
ventricles were punctured via the opened thoracic
cavity, and 5 mL of blood were collected for further analyses.
The body was transcardially perfused with 200 mL
of PBS. For flow cytometry of brain tissue (n = 3/3) removed
brains were dissected and isolated hemispheres
were stored in PBS at 4?C for 30 min. For gene expression
analysis (n = 5/5), removed brains were shock-frozen in
isopentane at −65?C and stored at −80?C. For histological
analyses (n = 4/4) PBS perfusion was followed by perfusion
of 200 mL of 4% formalin solution. Isolated brains were
kept in 4% formalin solution for 24 h and vitrified in a
30% sucrose solution. Consecutive coronal sections
(anterior/posterior 1.32 to −5.04 mm relative to bregma)
were cut with a thickness of 10 or 25 μm, respectively,
mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel, Braunschweig,
Germany) and finally stored at −20?C. For analysis of
neurogenesis, 40 μm thick free-floating sections (anterior/
posterior 0.88 to 0.36 mm relative to bregma) were stored
in tubes containing 25% glycerine, 25% ethylene glycol in
0.1 M phosphate buffer.
Hematological parameters
Basic hematological parameters (Red blood cell count,
RBC;hemoglobin,Hb;hematocrit,HCT;meancorpuscular
hemoglobin, MCH; mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration, MCHC; red blood cell distribution width,
RDW; platelet count, PLT; mean platelet volume, MPV)
were determined in blood samples anticoagulated with
2 mM EDTA using an animal blood counter (scil Vet abc,
Vet scil animal care company, Viernheim, Germany).

Flow cytometry
Multichannel flow cytometry was performed to subcategorize
leukocytes according to their antigen expression.
50 μL of EDTA-anticoagulated blood was diluted
and pre-incubated with normal mouse serum. Multiple
fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD45

APC-labeled, anti-CD8 PerCP-labeled, anti-CD161a
Biotin-labeled, secondly conjugated with streptavidin
Horizon? V500 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany),
anti-CD11b PacificBlue-labeled (AbD Serotec, Puchheim,
Germany) and anti-CD4 PE-Cy7-labeled (Biolegend, Fell,
Germany) were added for 20 min at 4?C. Erythroid cells
were lysed in distilled water. Cerebral leukocytes were
quantified as described previously [18]. Briefly, brain
hemispheres were manually chopped with a scalpel, and
further dissociated by Collagenase I (Sigma) and DNAse
I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in Hanks Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS). Percoll (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
UK) gradients were used for leukocyte separation. Cell
viability was quantified using trypan blue exclusion. Samples
of 1x10E5 cells were suspended in 100 μL of FACS 
buffer (3% fetal calf serum in PBS) and incubated for
20 min at 4?C with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies
(anti-CD3 FITC-labeled (BD Biosciences), anti-RP1 PE-
labeled, anti-CD161a Biotin-labeled, secondly conjugated
with streptavidin Horizon? V500 (BD Biosciences), anti-
CD45 PC5-labeled, anti-CD4 PC7-labeled (Biolegend),
anti-CD8 APC-labeled, CD11b PacificBlue-labeled (AbD
serotec)). Flow cytometry was performed using a 3-laser
FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Ashland, USA). CSF levels of IFNγ
and IL-10 were analyzed by Cytometric Bead Array
(BD Biosciences) as described in the manufacturer?s
instructions.
Gene expression analysis
For laser microdissection, shock-frozen brains were cut
into 30 μm thick coronal sections, placed on membrane
covered slides (MembraneSlide, Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
and dried. A PALM MicroBeam laser dissection microscope
(nitrogen laser, objective 20x, Zeiss) was used to
isolate small vessels (diameter≤50 μm) within the DCR
that were visualized in the bright field mode on naive
sections. The region of interest was manually encircled,
laser-dissected and transferred into a tube (Adhesive Caps,
Zeiss) by a second laser impulse. RNA of the acquired tissue
sample (9x10E6 μm3 per animal) was purified using
Rneasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For
whole brain analyses, brain tissue was mechanically dissociated
and total RNA of 100 mg tissue was extracted by
homogenization in 1 mL Trizol using an Ultra-Turrax
(Ika, Staufen, Germany) and further purified (RNeasy
Mini Kit, Qiagen). RNA was transcripted into cDNA
(Superscript III, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) according
to the manufacturer?s instructions. mRNA expression
was determined using an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) at the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 95?C for 10 min,
followed by 50 cycles at 95?C for 15 sec and 55?C for
1 min. qRT-PCR reactions were conducted with Quanti-
Tect SYBR Green PCR Kit and gene specific QuantiTect
primers (Qiagen): ICAM-1, QT00174447; VCAM-1,
QT00178500; nNOS, QT00186340; IL-1?, QT00181657;
TGF?, QT00187320; MMP-2, QT00996254; P-selectin,
QT00180418. Data were analyzed using the relative
standard curve method, normalized on the average
cycle threshold of the housekeeping genes (YWHAZ,
QT023821840; B2M QT00176295; RPL13a, QT00425873;
RPL22, QT00385119) and relativized to the respective
mean value of the WKY group.
Histology
First, 10 μm sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin
(HE). A total of 50 vessels (diameter 10? 50 μm) within
the DCR were acquired. The luminal and total vessel area
were manually encircled using an ECLIPSE Ti microscope
(Nikon, D?sseldorf, Germany) and FIJI software. The vessel
wall area was calculated by subtraction of the luminal
area from the total area. The diameter (d) was assessed by
circumference (C) d = C/π. To analyze the CC white
matter density, luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and nuclear
fast red counterstaining were performed. Whole
CCs were acquired using an ECLIPSE Ti microscope
and images were transformed into an 8 bit grey scale
format (black/white 0/255). The myelin index (mean grey
value) of the CC was automatically determined using FIJI.
For immunohistochemistry, 25 μm sections were blocked
with 5% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 and PBS for
60 min, and incubated with either rabbit anti-Iba1
(Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; 1:200;
Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany), biotinylated solanum
tuberosum lectin (STL; 1:300; Linaris, Dossenheim,
Germany), mouse anti-15-16A1 (1:500; Hycult Biotech,
Beutelsbach, Germany; for T cells), mouse anti-GFAP
(1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-CD161 (1:100, NovusBio,
Cambridge, UK) for 24 h at 4?C. Sections were then
incubated with AlexaFluor488- and 546-labeled speciesspecific
secondary antibody (1:400, Invitrogen) for 2 h.
STL was visualized by Cy5 Streptavidin (1:500, Jackson
ImmunoResearch, Baltimore Pike, USA). Cell nuclei were
stained with 4′, 6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI; Sigma)
for 5 min. Confocal stacks of GFAP- and Iba1-stained sections
were acquired in technical quadruplicates within the
DCR using a LSM 710 (Zeiss). Contents of image stacks
were converted into objects using the surface algorithm of
Imaris (Bitplane). Total volume (for GFAP), cell-specific
volume of dendrites and cells, as well as dendrite length

(for Iba1) were measured using the Surface and Filaments
algorithms (Bitplane). 15-16A1-positive T cells and Iba1-
positive microglia were counted and T cells were further
categorized (rod versus round; meninges, choroid plexus,
parenchyma) using a Stereo Investigator system (MBF
Bioscience, Williston, USA). Microglia distribution patterns
were analyzed using the Mosaic plugin (FIJI) as
described previously [19]. The number of doublecortin
(DCX)-immunoreactive cells in the subventricular zone
(SVZ) was determined on six randomly selected 40 μm
sections of each animal. Free-floating sections were
treated with 0.6% H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS;
0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris? HCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min. Following
washes in TBS, sections were blocked with a solution
containing TBS, 0.1% Triton-X100 and 3% normal donkey
serum solution for 30 min. The latter and goat anti-DCX
C-18 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA)
primary antibody was applied overnight at 4?C. DCX was
visualized by a fluorochrome-conjugated species-specific
secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor 488; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides
(Menzel). All DCX-positive cells in the SVZ were manually
counted using Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon).
Statistics
All analyses except for the LFB analysis were carried out
by investigators blinded to the group allocation. Time
series of systolic BP and MWM escape latency were
analyzed by repeated measures (RM) two-way ANOVA.
Microglia count and distribution was analyzed by one and
two way ANOVA, respectively. If required, ANOVAs were
followed by Bonferroni?s post-hoc tests. The remaining two
group comparisons were analyzed by t-tests. A p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
data were displayed as mean ? standard deviation (SD).
Data analysis was performed by Graph Pad Prism (version
5.03).
Results
Arterial hypertension in SHR is accompanied by cognitive
deficits
Repeated measurements of the systolic BP in nonanesthetized
SHR and age-matched WKY using the
tail-cuff method revealed a significant impact of the
strain (F(1,18) = 870.71 ; p < 0.001) and the time point
of investigation (F(1,18) = 16.04; p < 0.001). SHR exhibited
a significantly elevated systolic BP from the age of
12 weeks onwards that further increased at week 18.
By contrast, WKY did not show any variation of the
systolic BP during the observation period (Figure 1A).
Since cognitive impairment is a common feature of
human cSVD, we assessed memory function of both
strains by two common tests. In the MWM, the time of
analysis (F(1,12) = 6.288; p = 0.006), but not the strain
(F(1,12) = 0.548; p = 0.473) significantly influenced escape
latencies indicating that hippocampal integrity was mainly
preserved in SHR (Figure 1B). By contrast, SHR showed a
reduced capability to discriminate novel from previously
encountered objects in the NORT suggestive of an impaired
non-spatial working memory (Figure 1C).
SHR exhibit profoundly altered hematological parameters
Basic hematological parameters (Table 1) revealed significantly
elevated RBC counts in SHR, but this was not correlated
with changes of the Hb or the HCT. The average
amount of hemoglobin per RBC (MCH) was decreased
and the variation of RBC size (RDW) was increased in
SHR. We found almost twice as much platelets in the peripheral
blood of SHR, whereas the MPV was significantly
smaller when compared to WKY (Table 1). Flow cytometric
analyses of blood samples revealed similar leukocyte
counts, but considerable differences in some subpopulations.
SHR exhibited significantly less T cells, but higher
numbers of granulocytes (Table 1). While B and NK cell
counts were comparable between SHR and WKY, a trend
towards increased monocyte counts in SHR was observed
(p = 0.07 by t-test; Table 1).
Changes of the brain macro- and microstructure in SHR
In vivo T2 weighted brain MRI revealed a significant enlargement
of the ventricular system in SHR compared to
WKY (Figure 2A). Furthermore, SHR exhibited smaller
corpora callosa and brain volumes (Figure 2B and C).
The latter finding was corroborated by the assessment of
brain weights post mortem (SHR: 1952 ? 299 mg versus
WKY: 2282 ? 141 mg; p = 0.011 by t-test). LFB staining
disclosed that the decline in CC volume among SHR was
accompanied by a significant myelin loss (Figure 2D).
Analysis of BBB integrity by the EB method revealed
comparable amounts of dye extravasation per hemisphere,
but an increased leakage in the CC and the adjacent parenchyma
hereafter referred to as deep cortical region
(DCR; Figure 3A). Compared to WKY, EB extravasation
was significantly enhanced in the DCR of SHR indicating a
circumscribed BBB leakage within that region (Figure 3B).
To further explore astrocyte activation within the DCR, we
calculated three-dimensional reconstructions of astrocytes
visualized by GFAP staining and found that astrogliosis was
significantly induced in SHR (Figure 3C). Quantification of
Iba1+ brain microglia showed comparable cell counts in
the DCR and the total brain of both strains. However, a
nearest-neighbor analysis revealed that microglia is less
contiguous in SHR compared to WKY (Figure 4A). The
latter finding was evident in both, the DCR and the
remaining brain tissue (data not shown). Single cell morphological
analysis of microglia within the DCR indicated
comparable dendrite lengths, but increased cellular volumes
(Figure 4B) as indicative of microglial hypertrophy.

Microglial activation was further confirmed by flow cytometry
showing a significantly increased CD11b expression
[20] of brain microglia in SHR (Figure 4C).
CNS leukocyte counts and distribution are different in
SHR and WKY
Flow cytometric analysis revealed comparable CD45high
leukocyte counts in brain lysates of SHR and WKY
(Figure 5A). However, the co mposition of subpopulations
was clearly different. While the proportion of T
cells and CD11b + mononuclear cells (monocytes and
macrophages) was higher in WKY, we found that NK
cells constituted the predominant immune cell population
in brains of SHR (Figure 5A-C). Immunohistochemical
studies indicated that NK cells in brains of SHR were
exclusively located within the microvasculature and
exhibited an elongated rod-like form (Figure 5C).
Absolute T cell counts were higher in WKY brains
(Figure 6A), but further histological analyses revealed
remarkable differences in the distribution of T cells among
both strains. In normotensive WKY, the majority of T cells
was found in the choroid plexus (CP) and the meninges,
whereas in SHR, most of the T cells resided in the parenchymal
microvasculature (Figure 6B). The diverse
compartmentalization of T cells was accompanied by
lower levels of the anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine IL-10,
but similar concentrations of the Th1 cytokine IFNγ in
the CSF of SHR (Figure 6C). Next, we investigated the distribution
and morphology of T cells in the brain microvasculature
and found equal cell counts in the DCR and the
total brain (Figure 6D). In SHR, two-thirds of all T cells
were rod-shaped, indicating an advanced stage of the
leukocyte transmigration sequence [21]. By contrast, the
rod-to-round ratio was almost 1:1 in WKY. This ratio was
similar in the DCR and the remaining brain (Figure 6D).
T cell transmigration across the brain endothelium was
only sporadically observed (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Because T cell adhesion and trafficking is primarily controlled
by endothelial adhesion molecules, we analyzed
the mRNA expression of ICAM, VCAM and P-selectin in
brain endothelial cells after laser microdissection.
Interestingly, we found distinct expression patterns
with equal expression of ICAM-1, but upregulation of
VCAM-1 (Figure 6E) and reduced expression of P-Selectin
in hypertensive animals (SHR 8.4 ? 18.8% versus WKY
100 ? 77.9%, p = 0.036 by t-test).
Evidence for concomitant tissue repair and endothelial
dysfunction in brains of SHR
We finally analyzed processes counter-regulating inflammation
and allowing brain repair. The amount of
DCX-positive neural progenitors within the SVZ was

Figure 2 Structural brain differences between SH (spontaneously hypertensive) and WKY (Wistar Kyoto) rats. On T2-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) ventricles were significantly enlarged in SHR (A), whereas corpus callosum (CC) (B) and total brain volumes (C) were
significantly reduced. Representative T2-weighted coronal slices display large hyperintense lateral ventricles in SHR, which are barely visible in
WKY. The magnification highlights narrowing of the hypointense CC in SHR. Post-mortal quantification of myelin by Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed
a significantly decreased optical density (i.e. an increased myelin index) in the CC of SHR (D). Data are mean ? SD. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 by

the microvasculature of hypertensive animals in the
DCR differed markedly from that of WKY. Besides an
increase in the wall-to-lumen ratio (SHR: 8.56 ? 1.30
versus WKY: 5.50 ? 1.04; p = 0.03 by t-test), we observed
an augmentation of vessel volumes in SHR (Figure 7B).
Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), an important
source of endothelial nitric oxide [22] was significantly
down regulated in brain endothelium of SHR. Gene expression
of IL-1β was significantly increased in whole
brain lysates of SHR (p < 0.05; Figure 7D), but not in
endothelial cells (p = 0.1). Immunohistochemistry identified
astrocytes as major source of IL-1β (Additional file 3:
Figure S3). While mRNA expression of TGFβ was comparable
in the entire brain, it was significantly decreased
in endothelial cells of SHR. Endothelial matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-2 expression did not differ between SHR
and WKY (Figure 7D).
Discussion
We found first experimental evidence that SHR spontaneously
develop circumscribed BBB leakage, white
matter loss and cerebrovascular inflammation, accompanied
by memory deficits already in their first third of
life. SHR thus share many similarities with cSVD patients
in which a strong correlation between elevated
blood pressure, brain atrophy and cognitive decline was
shown [23,24].
Microvascular brain damage is commonly considered
a consequence of large artery stiffness and increased
pulse pressure. The latter accounts for pulsatile stress in
the microcirculation of high flow organs such as the brain
and induces remodeling of small vessel walls [25,26].
Untreated hypertension accelerates this process and
thus perpetuates a vicious cycle of progressive arterial
aging and rising blood pressure [27]. Besides invasive
hemodynamic monitoring, altered erythrocyte parameters
can be measured as surrogate markers for target
organ damage in hypertension. In line with clinical observations
[28,29], we found higher red blood cell counts and
an increased RDW in SHR, corroborating the assumption
that similar biophysical conditions determine microvascular
damage in SHR and hypertensive patients.
Wall hypertrophy and luminal diameter reduction of
small penetrating arteries are findings considered pathognomonic
for hypertensive cSVD [30]. A common hypothesis
is that these microvascular changes result in a state of
chronic hypoperfusion leading to oligodendrocyte death
and consecutive degeneration of myelinated fibers [31].
Indeed, we observed demyelination and volume loss of the
CC in SHR, conforming to white matter damage as another
important hallmark of human cSVD [30]. Additionally
, SHR exhibited global brain atrophy and ventricular
enlargement on T2-weighted MRI. However, our MRI investigations
neither revealed lacunar infarcts nor white

deep cortical region (DCR) did not differ strain-dependently (A). However, distances between adjacent cells were significantly greater in SHR
compared to WKY (A). Single cell morphological analysis of microglia within the DCR showed similar dendrite lengths, but increased cell volumes
in SHR (B). (C) Mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of microglial CD11b expression were significantly higher in SHR. The representative histogram

matter hyperintensities as key imaging features of cSVD
up to 35 weeks of age. One possible explanation is that
subtle white matter damage, as unambiguously present on
post mortem brain tissue of SHR, escaped detection in
our study because T2-weighted MRI is relatively insensitive
towards changes of the brain microstructure. A recent
clinical study supports this idea by providing convincing
evidence that changes of the white matter microstructure
quantifiable by diffusion tensor imaging temporally
precede the development of T2-visible white matter lesions
[32].
A large cross-sectional imaging study revealed that increased
systolic BP affects white matter microstructure
and grey matter volume already in young adults. Brain
injury preferentially occurred in the anterior CC and
other frontal white matter tracts being associated with
cognitive decline later in life [11]. In our study, middleaged
SHR showed a reduced discrimination capability
in the NORT. This test evaluates non-spatial working
memory primarily related to frontal subcortical circuits
[33] which are commonly affected in patients with hereditary
cSVD [34], but are also particularly susceptible
to hypertensive brain damage [11].
By contrast, performance in the MWM was similar to
age-matched normotensive controls, suggesting that the
integrity of the hippocampus is largely preserved in SHR
up to 35 weeks of age. This was surprising since several
clinical trials found evidence for an association between
elevated blood pressure, white matter lesions and reduced
hippocampal volume [11,35]. Moreover, a prior histological
study observed time-dependent loss of cornu ammonis 1
pyramidal neurons in SHR [36]. We did not assess hippocampal
volumes in this study, however, even if cell loss was
present it did not translate into abnormalities in the
MWM. One could speculate that destruction of hippocampal
neurons in middle-aged SHR with few months of
hypertension might not have passed a threshold beyond
which clinical decompensation occurs. However, our study
is hampered by assessment of cognitive performance at
only one time point, thus future studies investigating hippocampal
integrity and cognitive function in a longitudinal
manner are needed to clarify this issue. They might also
help to reliably establish the relationship between cognitive
decline and blood pressure levels.
Cognitive testing in SHR is additionally complicated
by the fact that they exhibit certain behavioral features
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) [37].
These behavioral abnormalities are present early in life
and are commonly ascribed to dopaminergic hypofunction
in SHR [38]. Executive dysfunction and attention deficits
are symptoms partly shared by ADHD [39] and cSVD
[40,41], however, motor hyperactivity and impulsiveness
do not belong to the neuropsychological profile of patients
with cSVD. Thus, concomitant neurotransmitter dysregulations
in SHR might limit its usefulness as an experimental
model for cSVD.
The idea of an anatomically predisposed region in early
stages of hypertensive cSVD [11,42] was further supported
by our finding of a circumscribed BBB leakage in SHR.
We found a significant increase of albumin extravasation
in the DCR adjacent to the CC while the total BBB function
was comparable between SHR and age-matched
normotensive controls. The structure of arterioles entering
deep brain regions from the superficial cortex particularly
exposes them to the effects of vascular disease and
might relate to this predilection site [4,10]. The DCR was
also characterized by a significant astrogliosis and activation
of microglia. This finding suits well with recent work
that stressed the close association of local BBB disruption
and inflammation with oligodendrocyte death following
unilateral carotid artery occlusion in SHR-SP [31]. In our
study, activated astrocytes were the primary source of the
central pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β which was significantly
increased in brain parenchyma of SHR. Similar
findings were previously obtained in rats with angiotensin
II induced hypertension [43]. In the brain, IL-1β directly
influences BBB permeability [44], antagonizes endothelial
anti-inflammatory TGFβ signaling [45] and increases
arterial BP [43]. Circumscribed neuroinflammation and
Figure 5 Brain leukocyte subpopulations differ between SHR
and WKY. Brains of SHR and WKY contained comparable numbers
of CD45 high leukocytes while the composition of subpopulations
was strongly different (A). NK cells constituted the predominant
immune cell type in SHR. By contrast, the proportion of T cells and
monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mɸ) was higher in WKY. Absolute
counts of Mo/Mɸ were decreased (B) whereas NK cells were significantly
increased in brains of SHR (C). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed
that CD161 positive NK cells (green) were exclusively located in the brain

IL-1β signaling hence seem to play an important role in
the pathophysiological cascade of hypertensive brain damage
and the further maintenance of hypertension.
Beyond the activation of brain-resident cells, we found
substantial differences in the amount and composition
of blood-borne leukocytes between SHR and normotensive
controls. In WKY, almost twice as much T cells were
detectable in brain lysates, but immunohistochemistry
revealed that they were mostly localized within the
meninges and CP. By contrast, in SHR the vast majority
of T cells populated the microvessels within the
brain parenchyma, and could be further distinguished
into round and rod shaped cells. The latter morphological
discrimination may represent two stages of the
leukocyte margination sequence [21], and firm adhesion
to the vessel wall may have hampered their removal during
the perfusion. The antithetic distribution of T cells in
brains of SHR and WKY could be well explained by different
expression patterns of endothelial adhesion molecules.
We found an upregulation of VCAM-1 in brain endothelial
cells of SHR, likely as consequence of an activated
renin angiotensin system during arterial hypertension
[46]. This finding is supported by clinical evidence for increased
levels of soluble VCAM-1 in cSVD patients [47].
Increased expression of adhesion molecules, and possibly
also a slowed vascular transit time of leukocytes due to
pseudopod formation [48] are conclusive explanations for
the ample occurrence of intravascular T cells in SHR
brains. On the other hand, T cells adhering to the luminal
side of cerebral microvessels might be part of the systemic
adaptive immune response against vascular neoantigens
during hypertension. T cells directly promote endothelial
dysfunction, but may also compromise brain perfusion
by microvascular plugging and thrombosis [49,50]. Importantly
, only the minority of T cells crossed the brain
endothelium in our study. Moreover, there was no
specific accumulation of T cells within the inflamed
DCR. Collectively, these findings argue against a CNS-
directed autoreactive T cell response in the early stages
of hypertensive neuroinflammation.
Another interesting finding was the considerable decrease
of T cells in the meningeal space and the CP of
SHR. This observation was accompanied by lower concentrations
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in
the CSF. Meningeal T cells have significant impact on
learning behavior, memory function and mood stabilization
[51,52]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that cognitive
deficits in hypertensive individuals could be, at least partly,
Figure 6 T cell compartmentalization and morphology is different in SHR. Absolute T cell counts were significantly lower in brains of SHR
(A). Histological analysis of T cell distribution in both strains revealed that only 20% of total T cells in SHR resided in the meninges and the
choroid plexus (CP), while the remaining cells were located in parenchymal microvessels (B). This distribution was reversed in WKY. (B) shows
representative sections of the meninges in SHR and WKY. T cells were identified by the pan T cell marker 15-16A1 (green). Distinct T cell
compartmentalization was accompanied by a decrease of IL-10, but similar levels of IFNγ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SHR (C). Numbers of
intravascular T cells neither differed in the total brain nor in the deep cortical region (DCR) (D). In SHR, two-thirds of all T cells were rod-shaped
while the rod-to-round ratio was almost 1:1 in WKY (D). Representative images of rod and round shaped T cells (green) in brain microvessels

a consequence of a disturbed CNS immune homeostasis.
T cell trafficking via the endo- and epithelium of the
CP to the CSF is highly dependent on P-selectin [53]
and P-selectin polymorphisms have been associated with
cognitive dysfunction [54,55]. In contrast to VCAM-1 and
ICAM-1, P-selectin was significantly down regulated in
the cerebral microvasculature of SHR in our study. This
finding is supported by previous studies and might be related
to increased levels of corticosteroids in SHR [56].
Further research is required to shed light on the relation
between cerebrovascular P-selectin expression and cognitive
decline in the context of hypertensive brain damage.
Another interesting result is the high amount of NK
cells in brains of SHR. The majority of these cells appeared
elongated and was located in the vessel lumina. A recent
study described an important cross-talk between monocytes
and NK cells during angiotensin II induced vascular
inflammation in the aortic wall. IL-12 secreting monocytes
attract and activate NK cells which sustain vascular dysfunction
by IFNγ production [57]. However, little is
known about the role of NK cells in cSVD. While previous
studies described that brains of hypertensive rats exhibit
significantly more perivascular monocytes/macrophages
compared to age-matched controls [58], we found lower
numbers of monocytes in SHR whole brain lysates. Moreover
, we did not observe myeloid cells that adhered to the
vessel walls in SHR, indicating that NK cells and myeloid
cells sojourn in different compartments of the neurovascular
unit. However, hypertension-related IFNγ production
by either NK cells or T cells [59] could possibly
explain the low expression of endothelial nNOS in brains
of hypertensive animals seen in our study. Downregulation
of nNOS in turn increases endothelial susceptibility
for inflammatory cytokines and enhances expression of
VCAM-1 [22].
Besides their direct participation in endothelial dysfunction
, T cells and NK cells might play an important
role in cerebral arteriogenesis [60] owing to perfusion
deficits and shear stress. In contrast to a recent study
[61], we actually observed evidence for arteriogenesis in
the DCR. However, cellular and molecular alterations as
a result of hypertension-related vascular dysfunction can
hardly be discriminated from changes induced by arteriogenesis
, since the latter process is also driven by inflammation
[62]. Neurogenesis is another counter-regulatory
mechanism which might be initiated by white matter injury
in cSVD [63]. In fact, a previous study demonstrated
enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive rats
Figure 7 Repair and inflammation in brains of SHR. Neurogenesis as measured by the number of doublecortin (DCX)-expressing cells in in
the subventricular zone (SVZ) was increased in SHR (A). Similarly, brains of SHR exhibited larger vessel volumes, assessed by three-dimensional
reconstruction of FITC-lectin stained endothelium (B). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was significantly down-regulated in endothelial cells
of SHR (C).IL-1 β expression was significantly increased in SHR whole brain lysates, whereas the expression of TGFβ was comparable. In SHR endothelial
cells, there was a non-significant increase of IL-1β expression and a significantly decreased expression of TGFβ. Endothelial matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-2 expression did not differ between SHR and WKY (D). Data are mean ? SD. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 by t-test for n = 3-5 animals/group. Scale

[64]. We found an increase of DCX-positive neural progenitors
in the SVZ of SHR further supporting the idea
that hypertensive brain damage is accompanied by repair
processes. One might assume that reduced endothelial
TGFβ expression due to hypertension-related inflammation
as seen in our study alters the neurovascular niche
and finally promotes neurogenesis [65]. However, if this is
the case and whether these repair mechanisms delay the
disease process and possible clinical thresholds of cSVD
needs to be elucidated in future studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study shows that hypertensive rats
spontaneously develop brain atrophy and white matter
loss as well as BBB leakage, astrogliosis and microglial
activation in the deep grey matter. They thus share many
neuropathological features with hypertensive brain damage
and cSVD in humans. Importantly, these changes of
the brain macro- and microstructure were already apparent
early in life indicating that SHR might serve as a
valid experimental model for early-stage cSVD. Neuroimaging
and cognitive testing partially revealed conflicting
results, but when considering overall findings of our study,
similarities with the human disease clearly outweigh
inconsistencies (Figure 8) [66-75]. Transfer of findings
from rats to humans remains difficult due to obvious
species differences, however, we believe that certain
aspects of human cSVD pathophysiology are well
reflected in SHR.
We additionally found evidence for endogenous repair
mechanisms in SHR which might delay disease manifestation
and progression. Furthermore, our results suggest
a role of NK and T cells for cerebrovascular inflammation
and hypertension-related cognitive decline. Due to the descriptive
character of our study, it remains to be proven
whether these changes causally contribute to disease development
or rather represent an epiphenomenon of the
disease process. However, if future research confirms the
contribution of the immune system to the initiation and
propagation of cSVD, new therapeutic approaches may
arise.
