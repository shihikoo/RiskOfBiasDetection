Background:The small molecule thrombolytic SMTP-7 excels in the treatment of ischemic stroke through an unidentified
anti-inflammatory activity.
Results: Affinity purification and inhibition studies reveal that SMTP-7 and its congeners inhibit soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH), an enzyme responsible for inflammation.
Conclusion:sEH is the plausiblein vivoanti-inflammatory target of SMTP-7.
Significance:Dual-targeting of thrombolysis and sEH is a promising strategy for novel stroke therapy.
Although ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability
worldwide, only a small fraction of patients benefit from
the current thrombolytic therapy due to a risk of cerebral hemorrhage
caused by inflammation. Thus, the development of a
new strategy to combat inflammation during thrombolysis is an
urgent demand. The small molecule thrombolytic SMTP-7
effectively treats ischemic stroke in several animal models with
reducing cerebral hemorrhage. Here we revealed that SMTP-7
targeted soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to suppress inflammation.
SMTP-7 inhibited both of the two sEH enzyme activities:
epoxide hydrolase (which inactivates anti-inflammatory epoxyfatty
acids) and lipid phosphate phosphatase. SMTP-7 suppressed
epoxy-fatty acid hydrolysis in HepG2 cells in culture,
implicating the sEH inhibition in the anti-inflammatory mechanism.
The sEH inhibition by SMTP-7 was independent of its
thrombolytic activity. The simultaneous targeting of thrombolysis
and sEH by a single molecule is a promising strategy to revolutionize
the current stroke therapy.
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide (1).
Improving the case fatality rates and long term disability after
stroke continues to be a challenge (2). During the past decade
thrombolytic enzyme tissue plasminogen activator-based
treatment has been the standard therapy for acute ischemic
stroke (2). However, due to its risk of parenchymal hemorrhage
and a limited therapeutic time window (3–5), only a small fraction
of patients (1.8–8.9%) benefits from tissue plasminogen
activator-based therapy (6, 7). The development of an alternative
therapeutic agent is urgently needed. In this context, suppressing
inflammation within the infarction area to rescue penumbral
tissue and reduce hemorrhagic transformation is
particularly important (8, 9).
SMTPs3 (named after Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl
phenols) are a family of novel small molecules produced by the
fungus Stachybotrys microspora (10–12). SMTP-7 (Fig. 1A),
one of the SMTP family compounds with profound biological
activities, enhances plasminogen activation by modulating
plasminogen conformation (10, 13–15). SMTP-7 thus promotes
plasmin formation and clot clearancein vivo(14, 16), and
it has been used to treat thrombotic and embolic strokes in
experimental models in rodents and nonhuman primates (17–
20). Unexpectedly, SMTP-7 was demonstrated to reduce hemorrhagic
transformation and to have a wide therapeutic time
window (17, 18, 20). These excellent activities are partly
explained by the finding that, unlike tissue plasminogen activator
, SMTP-7 suppresses inflammatory/oxidative responses
after thrombolytic reperfusion (16, 18, 19, 21). These beneficial
properties prompted the development of SMTP-7 as an alternative
stroke drug that can treat patients who do not benefit
from tissue plasminogen activator-based therapy (20).
The aim of the present study was to explore the anti-inflammatory
mechanism of SMTP-7. We first compared the efficacy
of two SMTP congeners differing in the potential of thrombolytic
activity using three inflammatory disease animal models.
The results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory action of
SMTP is independent of its thrombolytic activity. We next
searched for an anti-inflammatory target using SMTP affinity
beads resulting in the identification of soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH). sEH is a bifunctional enzyme with an epoxide hydrolase
activity at the C-terminal domain (Cterm-EH) and a lipid
phosphate phosphatase activity at the N-terminal domain

(Nterm-phos) (22). The Cterm-EH catalyzes the hydrolysis of
epoxy fatty acids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs),
which are potent endogenous signaling molecules implicated in
anti-inflammation, vascular dilation, endothelial cell hyperpolarization
, angiogenesis, neuroprotection, and analgesia (antihyperalgesia
) (23–27). The Nterm-phos hydrolyzes lipid phosphates
such as lysophosphatidic acid and intermediates of the
cholesterol biosynthesis (28–30). SMTP-7 inhibited both of the
two activities of sEH: competitively for Cterm-EH and pseudononcompetitively
for Nterm-phos. The treatment of HepG2
cells with of SMTP-7 or its congeners suppressed the hydrolysis
of EET to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET). Here, we
describe the anti-inflammatory action of SMTP-7 and its
mechanism.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Experiments—All of the animal protocols were
approved by the institutional animal experiment committees at
the Tokyo Noko University and Nihon Pharmaceutical. Male
C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks old; Japan SLC, Hamamatsu) and male
Lewis rats (6 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories Japan,
Yokohama) were used after 1 week of preliminary rearing for
the inflammatory disease models. Retired male ICR mice (Japan
SLC, Hamamatsu) were used to obtain the livers for the sEH
purification.
SMTP Congeners—The SMTP congeners used in this study
were produced by S. microspora as described previously (11–
13, 31–34). For in vivo studies, SMTP-7 and SMTP-44D were
converted to respective sodium salts.
Guillain-Barre´ Syndrome Model—On day 0, male Lewis rats
(7 weeks old) were given 0.1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of the synthetic
P2 peptide (35) (H-TESPFKNTEISFKLGQEFEETTADNR-OH
corresponding to Thr-53–Arg-78 of bovine P2 protein; 2.5 mg
ml1 in saline) and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant containing
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Ra (Difco) by injection into
the foot pads of both of the hind limbs. Sodium salts of SMTP-7
and SMTP-44D dissolved in 5% (wt vol1) mannitol was intraperitoneally
injected at a dose of 10 mg kg1through days 7–16.
As a standard, sulfonated immunoglobulin formulation (Kaketsuken
, Kumamoto, Japan) was given intravenously at a dose of
400 mg kg1 on days 0, 7, 14, 15, and 16. Control animals
received no drug treatment. Normal animals received neither
P2 peptide nor any drug. The experimental autoimmune neuritis
score (score 0, normal; 0.5, reduced tone of the tail; 1, limp
tail; 2, moderate paraparesis; 3; severe paraparesis; 4, tetraparesis
or death) was determined on days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, and
24. There were five animals in each group.
Ulcerative Colitis Model—Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old)
were given dextran sulfate sodium salt (36–50 kDa) (36) contained
in drinking water (2%, wt vol1) daily through days 0–7.
Sodium salt of SMTP-7 or SMTP-44D was intraperitoneally
injected at a dose of 10 mg kg1. As standards, 5-aminosalicylic
acid (37) (10 mg ml1 in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) or
sodium prednisolone succinate (2 mg ml1in phosphate-buffered
saline) were given orally at a dose of 100 and 20 mg kg1,
respectively. Drugs were given daily through days 0–7. Control
animals received no drug treatment. Normal animals received
neither dextran sulfate nor any drug. The disease activity index
score (38, 39), determined based on the change in body weight
(score 0,1%; 1, 1–5%; 2, 5–10%; 3, 10–20%; 4,20%), stool
inconsistency (score 0, normal; 2, loose; 4, diarrhea), and stool
blood (score 0, negative; 2, occult blood; 4, gross bleeding) was
measured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. There were five animals in
each group.
Crohn Disease Model—Male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old)
were intrarectally injected with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic
acid (TNBS) (40) solution (20 mg ml1in 50% ethanol) at a dose
of 100 mg kg1. SMTP-7, SMTP-44D, 5-aminosalicylic acid, or
prednisolone was administered as described for the dextran
sulfate model. These treatments were made 30 min before the
TNBS injection as well as 24, 48, and 72 h after the TNBS injection.
Control animals received no drug treatment. Normal animals
received neither TNBS nor any drug. The disease activity
index score was measured on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 after the TNBS
injection. There were five animal in each group.
SMTP-47—SMTP-47 was synthesized by the microbial
amine feeding method (31). For the preparation of feeding
amine, N

SMTP-50-coupled Affinity Matrix—One column volume (1
ml for target identification or 5 ml for target purification) of 1.2
mM SMTP-50, dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.3,
was applied to a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE
Healthcare) at room temperature for 30 min. The column was
then treated with monoethanolamine to block residual N-hydroxysuccinimidyl
group of the matrix.
Identification of SMTP-binding Protein—The livers from
male ICR mice were perfused with ice-cold saline and homogenized
in 4 volumes of 25 mMTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150
mMNaCl and 0.2% (wt vol1) sodium deoxycholate (buffer A).
A supernatant fraction was obtained after centrifugation at
1000gfor 15 min followed by 20,000gfor 15 min at 4 °C.
After filtration, 15 ml of the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml
SMTP-affinity column pre-equilibrated with buffer A at 20 °C.
The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A and developed
with 10 ml of buffer A containing additional NaCl (500 mM,
finally). Aliquots of the eluate were resolved by reduced SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Coomassie Brilliant Blue
R250-stained protein bands were excised from the gel and
digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were subjected to
chemically assisted fragmentation post-source decay analysis
by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) timeof-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometry on a Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro
(Amersham Biosciences) or LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis on
a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham
, MA). Detected masses were subjected to amino acid
sequence analysis and to comparison with theoretical peptide
masses on MASCOT search engine (Matrixscience, Boston,
MA) to identify the protein species.
Purification of sEH by SMTP Affinity Chromatography—All
of the following operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. The
livers from male ICR mice were homogenized in 11.5 volumes
of76mMsodiumphosphate,pH7.4.Asupernatantfractionwas
obtained after centrifugation at 1000gfor 10 min followed by
10,000 g for 25 min and then 100,000 g for 60 min. The
resulting cytosol fraction (250 ml) was applied to a 5-ml SMTP-
column pre-equilibrated with 76 mM sodium phosphate, pH
7.4, containing 0.1 mM EDTA (buffer B). After washing with
buffer B (200 ml), the column was developed with 60 ml of
buffer B containing 10M12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)dodecanoic
acid (AUDA). The eluate was dialyzed against buffer B to
remove AUDA and ultrafiltered to concentrate and exchange
buffer to 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM
dithiothreitol. From 3 batches of affinity chromatography, 2.2
mg of homogeneous sEH was purified. The purified sEH had
specific activities of 511 nmol min1 mg1 for the Cterm-EH
and 2850 nmol min1mg1for the Nterm-phos when we used
trans-stilbene oxide andp-nitrophenyl phosphate as respective
substrates.
LC-MS Analysis of EET and DHET—Samples to be analyzed
were extracted with ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, supernatant
was concentrated to dryness. The resulting materials
were dissolved in methanol and subjected to LC-MS analysis
for 14,15-EET and 14,15-DHET on a Micromass Quattro
Ultima triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped
with an electrospray ionization interface (Waters, Tokyo,
Japan). Samples (10l) were resolved on a silica-ODS column
(1002 mm; Pegasil ODS SP100–3, Senshu Scientific, Tokyo,
Japan) developed at 0.2 ml min1with a linear gradient of acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid (60–100%) for 15 min). The electrospray
ionization was performed in the negative ion mode
with a capillary voltage at 3.0 kV. The cone voltages were set at
35 V for 14,15-DHET/14,15-DHET-d11, and 30 V for 14,15-
EET/14,15-EET-d11. Data were acquired in the multichannel
analysis mode and analyzed using the MassLynx software (Version
3.5; Waters).
Assay for sEH—The Cterm-EH activity was assayed with
14,15-EET or (3-phenyl-oxiranyl)-acetic acid cyano-(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl
)-methyl ester (PHOME) as a substrate.
When using PHOME, we preincubated mouse sEH (60 ng) for
10 min in 80lof25m M Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1
mM MgCl
2
and 0.1 mg ml1 bovine serum albumin (buffer C)
with or without a compound to be tested. The composition of
buffer C was based on the method by Tran et al. (28), unless
MgCl
2
was added to unify the buffer composition with that for
Nterm-phos determination, in which MgCl
2
is essential. After
adding 20l of the substrate, fluorescence (excitation, 355 nm;
emission, 460 nm) of the reaction product was measured kinetically
at 30 °C. The final concentrations of sEH and PHOME in
the standard assay conditions were 4.7 nMand 12.5M, respectively.
When using EET, we incubated mouse sEH (0.18 ng)
with 14,15-EET in 60l of buffer C at 30 °C for 20 min. After the
addition of 14,15-EET-d
11
and 14,15-DHET-d
11
(25 pmol and 5
pmol, respectively) as internal standards, 14,15-DHET formed
was determined by LC-MS as described above. The Ntermphos
activity was assayed with AttoPhos as a substrate. Mouse
sEH (30 ng) was preincubated for 10 min in 80 l of buffer C
with or without a compound to be tested. After adding 20lof
AttoPhos, fluorescence (excitation, 450 nm; emission, 545 nm)
of the reaction product was measured kinetically at 30 °C. The
final concentrations of sEH and AttoPhos in the standard assay
conditions were 2.3 nMand 5M, respectively.
Assay for 14,15-EET Hydrolysis in Cultured Cells—HepG2
cells (5104cells) were seeded on 24-well plates and cultured
overnight. Cells were then washed with Hanks’ balanced salt
solution containing 20 mMHepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg ml1bovine
serum albumin, and 1 mM MgCl
2
(buffer D) and subsequently
treated with various concentrations of SMTP-7 (0–30 M)in
500l of buffer D for 10 min. After the addition of 14,15-EET
(0.3M) to the culture for 40 min, the reaction was stopped by
adding 2-propanol (300 l). After the addition of 14,15-EET-
d
11
and 14,15-DHET-d
11
(200 and 10 pmol, respectively), the
amounts of 14,15-EET remaining and 14,15-DHET formed
were determined by LC-MS as described above.

RESULTS
Anti-inflammatory Action Independent of Plasminogen Modulation
—Although SMTP-7 reduces inflammatory responses
in thromboembolic stroke models, it was unclear whether or
not this outcome is a consequence of the recanalization by
thrombolytic enhancement. We thus employed inflammatory
disease models (Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, ulcerative colitis,
and Crohn disease models) that were irrelevant to thromboembolic
complications to directly assess the anti-inflammatory
action of SMTP-7. We compared the efficacy of SMTP-7 with
that of its congener, SMTP-44D (11) (Fig. 1A), which is essentially
inactive in the plasminogen modulation activity (Fig. 1B).
In the Guillain-Barre´ syndrome model in rats, SMTP-7 (10 mg
kg1) and SMTP-44D (10 mg kg1) both ameliorated neuritis
symptoms as did the clinically used immunoglobulin formula-

tion (400 mg kg1) (Fig. 1C). Both SMTP-7 (10 mg kg1) and
SMTP-44D (10 mg kg1) alleviated the disease-associated body
weight loss, stool inconsistency, and intestinal bleeding in the
models of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease in mice (Fig. 1,
D–G and H–K). These effects were comparable with more
prominent than the effects of the standard drug 5-aminosalicylic
acid (100 mg kg1) and those of prednisolone (20 mg
kg1). Thus, the anti-inflammatory action of SMTP is independent
of the plasminogen modulation activity.
Identification of sEH as a Target—To identify the molecule
that is involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SMTP,
we designed an affinity matrix that contained an essential part
of SMTP, tricyclic -lactam with a geranylmethyl side chain
(Fig. 2A). To prepare the SMTP congener with a primary amine

at the N-linked side chain (SMTP-50), we first synthesized a
precursor with the primary amine of SMTP-50 protected by a
9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (SMTP-47) (Fig. 2A)by
the precursor amine-fed culture method (31). After eliminating
the protective group, the resulting SMTP-50 was coupled to
cross-linked agarose beads.
Detergent-solubilized homogenates of the mouse liver were
subjected to affinity chromatography on the SMTP-coupled
beads. The resulting eluate gave several protein bands on SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We subjected four specifically
eluted protein species to peptide-mass fingerprinting
analysis (Fig. 2B), and every protein species was identified as a
full-length form or a fragment of sEH (Fig. 2,CandD, and Table
1). The purification of sEH to homogeneity was achieved when
SMTP-affinity chromatography was performed using a cytosol
fraction of detergent-free homogenates and an elution buffer
containing AUDA, a competitive inhibitor of the Cterm-EH of
sEH (41) (Fig. 2E).
Inhibition of sEH—SMTP-7 inhibited both the Cterm-EH
and the Nterm-phos of sEH (their respective IC
50
values were
23	 1 and 6	 1 M) when we used the synthetic substrates
PHOME and AttoPhos, respectively (Fig. 3,AandB). Similarly,
SMTP-44D inhibited Cterm-EH and Nterm-phos (IC
50
27	2
and 24	 3M, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the
structurally simplest congener SMTP-0 (which lacks the
N-linked side chain) was inhibitory to both activities (IC
50
6	
1 and 14	 1 M, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the
structural requirement for sEH inhibition is clearly distinguishable
from that for plasminogen modulation activity in which
theN-linked side chain plays a crucial role (11, 12, 32).
We performed detailed kinetic analyses of sEH inhibition
using SMTP-0 and the natural substrate 14,15-EET. The use of
SMTP-0 was to avoid complexity of data analysis: SMTP-0 consists
of a single core unit of SMTP (Fig. 3), whereas SMTP-7 has
two core units that are asymmetrically configured (Fig. 1A), and
each of these may differently interact with the enzyme. The
kinetic results revealed a positive cooperativity for the hydrolysis
of 14,15-EET (Fig. 4A) (Hill coefficient of 1.9 for the substrate
binding; Fig. 4B), suggesting an allosteric interaction
between the two monomers of sEH. The data were, therefore,
analyzed based on a nonlinear mathematical model that
allowed allostericity between the two equivalent catalytic sites
of Cterm-EH (Fig. 4C). The pattern of the Cterm-EH inhibition
by SMTP-0 fitted well to a competitive model (Fig. 4,AandC).
Moreover, Cterm-EH inhibition by SMTP-0 was competed for
by AUDA (this class of inhibitor binds to the catalytic site in
Cterm-EH (42)) (Fig. 4, D and E). These results are consistent
with the observation that sEH is specifically eluted with AUDA
in SMTP affinity chromatography. Regarding the Nterm-phos,
the kinetic data fitted to a linear mathematical model (Fig. 5,
A–C), suggesting no cooperativity between the two Ntermphos
domains (Hill coefficient of 0.91; Fig. 5B). The inhibition
of Nterm-phos by SMTP-0 was pseudo-noncompetitive with
respect to the substrate AttoPhos (Fig. 5,AandB). The pseudononcompetitive
mechanism suggests that the Nterm-phos
inhibition is mediated by the SMTP-0 binding to an allosteric
site other than the substrate binding site in the Nterm-phos.
Because there remained a possibility that the binding of
SMTP-0 to the substrate binding site in the Cterm-EH might
affect the activity of the Nterm-phos, we assessed the inhibitory
activity of SMTP-0 toward the Nterm-phos in the presence of
AUDA, which competed with SMTP-0 for binding to the catalytic
site in the Cterm-EH (Fig. 4D). As a result, the presence of
AUDA did not affect the SMTP-0 inhibition of the Nterm-phos
(Fig.5,DandE).Thus,SMTP-0shouldbindtotwodistinctsites
in sEH; one is the catalytic site in the Cterm-EH, and the other
is an allosteric site that affects the Nterm-phos.
The structure-activity relationships of SMTP congeners differing
in the N-linked side chain are summarized in Fig. 6.
Although the minimum structural requirement for the sEH
inhibition was the tricyclic-lactam with a geranylmethyl side
chain (represented by SMTP-0), the difference in theN-linked
side chain variably affected the potency of the inhibition of the
Cterm-EH and Nterm-phos. The congener with a naphthalene

(SMTP-16) (32) or a glucose moiety as theN-linked side chain
(SMTP-33) (32) was essentially inactive in inhibiting the
Cterm-EH and Nterm-phos. SMTP-54 (with a glutamine moiety
) (33) and SMTP-55 (with a glutamic acid moiety) (33) were
relatively specific for the inhibition of the Cterm-EH. On the
other hand, SMTP-5D (with a D-leucine moiety) (34) was relatively
specific for the inhibition of the Nterm-phos. The inhibitory
activity of the congeners with a phenylamine derivative as
the N-linked side chain (such as SMTP-26, SMTP-27, and
SMTP-28) (12) were potent with respect to both the Cterm-EH
and Nterm-phos inhibitions. The variability of the inhibition
selectivity (IC
50
for the Cterm-EH versus that for the Ntermphos
) supports the idea that SMTPs bind to two distinct sites in
sEH.
Inhibition of EET Metabolism—HepG2 cells had an ability to
hydrolyze 14,15-EET to 14,15-DHET, an inactive diol. SMTP-7
inhibited the formation of 14,15-DHET from 14,15-EET added
to the culture medium (IC
50
6.5M) (Fig. 7A). Along with the
inhibition of the 14,15-EET hydrolysis, the level of 14,15-EET
was elevated in the presence of SMTP-7 (Fig. 7A). SMTP-0 and
SMTP-44D were also active in inhibiting 14,15-DHET formation
from 14,15-EET in HepG2 cells (IC
50
1.2 and 9.2 M,
respectively) (Fig. 7B).

plasma obtained from Guillain-Barre´ syndrome model rats. A
global analysis revealed that SMTP-7 did not significantly affect
the levels of 47 out of 48 metabolites examined (see “Experimental
Procedures” for metabolites analyzed), resulting in a
small change in the distribution of the three classes of arachidonate
metabolites (Fig. 8A). The only one metabolite that was
significantly affected by the treatment with SMTP-7 was 11,12-
DHET. The level (% distribution among the 48 metabolites) of
11,12-DHET in SMTP-7-treated rats was significantly lower
than that in saline-treated rats (13.5	 0.17% compared with
20.2	 0.04% in saline group, p 0.05; Fig. 8B). The levels of
5,6-, 8,9-, and 14,15-DHETs, however, were not significantly
changed by the treatment with SMTP-7 (Fig. 8B). The levels of
all regioisomers of EETs were too low to be detected by the
method employed. The result that SMTP-7 selectively
decreased 11,12-DHET can partly be explained by inhibition of
sEH. Details of this interpretation are described under
“Discussion.”
DISCUSSION
SMTP-7 has a plasminogen modulation activity that leads to
a thrombolytic enhancement as observed in several animal
models (14, 16, 20). SMTP-7 effectively treats thrombotic and
embolic stroke models (17, 18, 20), and the involvement of an
additional mechanism that leads to anti-inflammation has been
suggested (16, 18, 19, 21). In the present study we observed the
SMTP anti-inflammatory action that is independent of the
plasminogen modulation activity. Although thein vivomodels
used in this study (Guillain-Barre´ syndrome, ulcerative colitis,
and Crohn disease) are apparently irrelevant to thromboembolic
complication, there remained a possibility that a local
generation of plasmin might affect disease progress. Therefore,
we compared the effect of SMTP-7 with that of the congener
SMTP-44D, which is essentially inactive in plasminogen modulation
activity (11). The results clearly demonstrate that both
compounds are effective in treating these inflammatory disease

models (Fig. 1). Thus we conclude that SMTPs have an antiinflammatory
activity independent of their plasminogen modulation
activity. A target molecule for the anti-inflammatory
action should, therefore, exist. In addition, the structural
requirement for the anti-inflammatory action could be different
from that for the plasminogen modulation activity.
To identify the anti-inflammatory target, we designed an
affinity matrix that can bind a target protein. In our preliminary
experiments, we observed anti-inflammatory effects with
SMTP congeners with varying N-linked side-chain structures.
We, therefore, employed the strategy of coupling the core
SMTP structural moiety (tricyclic -lactam with a geranylmethyl
side-chain) to a bead via an N-linked side chain. The
major protein that bound to the resulting affinity matrix was
sEH (Fig. 2). We purified a homogeneous sEH preparation by
performing a single-step chromatography on this matrix using
AUDA, which binds to the catalytic site of the Cterm-EH, as an
eluent. This result is consistent with the fact that SMTP-0 competitively
inhibits the Cterm-EH (Fig. 4). In addition to its inhibition
of Cterm-EH, SMTP-0 inhibits the Nterm-phos pseudononcompetitively
(Fig. 5). The result that the inhibition of the
Cterm-EH, but not the Nterm-phos, by SMTP-0 is competed

for by AUDA suggests a mechanism in which SMTP-0 binds to
two distinct sites in sEH; one is the substrate binding site in the
Cterm-EH and the other is an allosteric site that affects the
Nterm-phos. We observed a positive cooperativity in Cterm-
EH, whereas no cooperativity (43) or a negative cooperativity in
Cterm-EH (44) has been reported in previous studies. These
variablefindingsmaybeduetotheuseofenzymefromdifferent
sources (native or recombinant) and/or buffer compositions.
As expected from the crystal structure, sEH has higher order
intradomain and interdomain interactions (45), and environmental
conditions would affect the conformational status of
sEH to exhibit cooperativity. Nevertheless, kinetic parameters
obtained with these three investigations are relatively close

The structure-activity relationship results, which reveal variable
inhibition selectivity (the ratio of the IC
50
of the Cterm-EH
over that of the Nterm-phos) among congeners with different
N-linked side chains (Fig. 6), support this idea. Although the physiological
function of the Cterm-EH has been extensively characterized
by the use of the combination of sEH-deficient animals and
specific inhibitors of the Cterm-EH (46–56), the role of the
Nterm-phos remains elusive because of the lack of information
about the relevant substrate and a potent specific inhibitor. The
existence of an allosteric site that affects the Nterm-phos has not
been reported. Our structure-activity relationship data suggest the
possibility that a selective Nterm-phos inhibitor can be developed
based on the allosteric mechanism.
EETs are signaling molecules implicated in anti-inflammation
(57,58).SMTP-7anditscongenersinhibitedthehydrolysis
of 14,15-EET to the inactive 14,15-DHET in HepG2 cells (Fig.
7). In addition, the plasma level of 11,12-DHET in Guillain-
Barre´ syndrome model rats was significantly decreased by
SMTP-7 treatment (Fig. 8), whereas the levels of 5,6-, 8,9-, and
14,15-DHETs were unaffected. The levels of 5,6- and 8,9-
DHETs were low, which is consistent with the finding by Li et
al. (59). The lack of effect of SMTP-7 on the levels of these
metabolites can be explained by the low catalytic activity of sEH
toward these regioisomers (43, 60), letting sEH to contribute
lesser to these levels. We speculate the lack of effect on the
14,15-DHET level is due to complex mechanisms of the formation
/catabolism (degradation and excretion) of EETs and
DHETs under physiological conditions. According to previous
literatures (43, 60, 61) the specific activity of human sEH for the
hydrolysis of 14,15-EET is approximately2 times higher than
that for 11,12-EET. In our animal model, the circulating level of
14,15-DHET was only 1.1 times higher than that of 11,12-
DHET in control animals. Thus, it is likely that the rates of
degradation and/or excretion of 14,15-DHET in this model is
higher than those of 11,12-DHET. This may make it difficult to
reflect the impact of sEH inhibition by SMTP-7. The selective
change in the 11,12-DHET level by SMTP-7 suggest a specificity
of SMTP-7 in the arachidonate metabolisms. Along with the
in vitrodata, thisin vivoresult supports the idea that sEH is an
anti-inflammatory target of SMTP-7.
The deficiency of sEH and the inhibition of the Cterm-EH
have been reported to be protective against disease progression
in animal models of inflammatory bowel diseases (62). In
thrombotic and embolic stroke models in rodents and primates
, SMTP-7 exhibited excellent activities, with a wide therapeutic
time window and a reduced cerebral hemorrhage (17, 18,
20), that were not achieved by the conventional thrombolytic
therapy. The finding that SMTP-7 inhibits sEH suggests that
this activity, aside from the thrombolytic enhancement by plasminogen
modulation, may account for these additional pharmacological
potentials of SMTP-7. The observations that the
sEH deficiency or the Cterm-EH inhibition is protective against
experimental stroke (63–65) support this hypothesis. The
pharmacological significance of the SMTP-7 ability to inhibit
the Nterm-phos remains to be investigated. SMTP congeners
that selectivity inhibit the Nterm-phos can be useful tools to
investigate the physiological role of the Nterm-phos.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated SMTP-7’s anti-inflammatory
action that is independent of its plasminogen modulation
activity. The finding that SMTP-7 inhibits sEH and the
resulting hydrolysis of the anti-inflammatory signaling molecule
EET suggests that sEH inhibition is involved in the antiinflammatory
action of SMTP-7. The combination of throm-

SMTP-7 in treating thrombotic and embolic strokes. SMTP-7
is under development as an alternative drug that could be effective
in stroke patients who do not benefit from the standard
thrombolytic therapy.
