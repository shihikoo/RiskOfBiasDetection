Abstract
Abnormal cerebral oxygenation and vessel structure is a crucial feature of stroke. An imaging
method with structural and functional information is necessary for diagnosis of stroke.
This study applies QSM-mMRV (quantitative susceptibility mapping-based microscopic
magnetic resonance venography) for noninvasively detecting small cerebral venous vessels
in rat stroke model. First, susceptibility mapping is optimized and calculated from magnetic
resonance (MR) phase images of a rat brain. Subsequently, QSM-mMRV is used to
simultaneously provide information on microvascular architecture and venous oxygen saturation
(SvO
2
), both of which can be used to evaluate the physiological and functional characteristics
of microvascular changes for longitudinally monitoring and therapeutically
evaluating a disease model. Morphologically, the quantification of vessel sizes using QSM-
mMRV was 30% smaller than that of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which eliminated
the overestimation of conventional SWI. Functionally, QSM-mMRV estimated an
average SvO
2
ranging from 73% to 85% for healthy rats. Finally, we also applied QSM to
monitor the revascularization of post-stroke vessels from 3 to 10 days after reperfusion.
QSM estimations of SvO
2
were comparable to those calculated using the pulse oximeter
standard metric. We conclude that QSM-mMRV is useful for longitudinally monitoring blood
oxygen and might become clinically useful for assessing cerebrovascular diseases.

Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability, also one of the commonest causes of mortality
in aging countries [1]. Abnormal structure and blood oxygen saturation (SO
2
) of cerebral
microvessels (diameter:100μm) [2] is a critical feature of stroke. Characterizing unusual
microvascular change and extraordinary SO
2
might be useful for the diagnosis and the prognosis
of stroke [1,3]. Thus, measuring cerebral blood oxygen saturation might be necessary for an
accurate diagnosis, to predict disease outcomes, and to monitor the treatment response in
stroke.
The most commonly used noninvasive methodologies of medical imaging in clinical and
experimental neuroscience for assessing the cerebral microvessels in cerebrovascular diseases
like stroke, glioma, and vascular malformation are computed tomography angiography (CTA)
and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Although CTA with a contrast agent can rapidly
and accurately detect the structure of blood vessels [4], it has the potential negative side affect
of ionizing radiation. In contrast, MRA-based techniques, such as time-of-flight (TOF)-MRA
and contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRA, are not radioactive. TOF-MRA is sensitive to the fast-flowing
signals in arteries and depends on the motion of water protons [5]. However, TOF-MRA is
limited to measuring small cerebral vessels (venules, arterioles, and capillaries) because of
slow-flowing signals in the cerebral microvessels. CE-MRA uses gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast
agents to detect these slow-flowing signals [6]. Nonetheless, CE-MRA might not satisfy
the long acquisition time required for high-resolution MRA application because it has a short
intravascular half-life and rapidly redistributes into the extracellular space.
Deoxyhemoglobin, however, provides natural contrast enhancement. Based on this advantage
, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) has been proposed for visualizing venous vascular
architecture and has provided structural information for more than a decade [7]. Furthermore,
SWI combines MR magnitude and phase images, and it is more sensitive for detecting magnetic
substances such as deoxyhemoglobin, hemorrhage, iron, etc. Moreover, SWI is also
widely used clinically to visualize and diagnose venous vascular malformations, stroke, and
traumatic brain injuries. It has also been used to longitudinally assess ischemic vessel size in a
rat stroke model [8]. Although it can characterize vascular structure, SWI cannot provide functional
information about blood vessels.
To quantify vascular information, previous studies assessed venous oxygen saturation
(SvO
2
) with the relaxation time T
2
 [9,10]. However, T
2
 is not a high-specificity index because
it depends on the measurement conditions of B
0
inhomogeneity, on the relaxation time T
2
(without the effect of B
0
inhomogeneity), and on the properties of blood vessels. Additionally,
T
2
 produces inconsistent results under various B
0
s because of the dependence between T
2
and
B
0
. Conversely, the intrinsic susceptibility of hemoglobin is a potential index for measuring
SvO
2
. Based on susceptibility measurements, others have shown that MR phase images can be
used to estimate SvO
2
in the brain tissue of humans [11–15] and rodents [16,17]. Nevertheless,
using MR phase imaging to quantify SvO
2
is vessel-orientation dependent, and MR phase
images show apparent blooming artifacts.
Recently, a novel approach called quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), based on MR
phase imaging, is being used to quantify MR images with magnetic susceptibility without
blooming artifacts [18–24]. In addition, QSM has be used to assess the SvO
2
in healthy human
brains [20,25–28] and to detect decreases in the SvO
2
in patients with cerebral ischemic stroke
[29]. Although the QSM technique has been used quantify to SvO
2
in humans, it has not been
used to quantify cerebral SvO
2
in rat stroke model. Characterizing the cerebral SvO
2
with QSM
in rat stroke model facilitates the understanding of mechanism in brain disorder. Thus, applying
QSM to rat stroke model is crucial for neuroscience research.

The present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using QSM for assessing cerebral
SvO
2
on stroke in rat. A 3D high-resolution gradient-echo (GRE) image with a spatial resolution
of 100 × 100 × 100μm3was used to generate the QSM. QSM processing was optimized
from single-echo GRE images for rat brain venography, which included phase unwrapping,
background field removal, and dipole inversion. The influence of choosing different values of
QSM parameter was investigated. The cerebral microvessels of a healthy rat were visualized
and the SvO
2
quantified after QSM reconstruction. To demonstrate the abilities of QSM, we
also compared it with the conventional SWI method. Finally, QSM was used for longitudinal
monitoring of post-stroke revascularization on days 3–10 after reperfusion.
Materials and Methods
Susceptibility Calculation Based on Phase Information
The effects of magnetic susceptibility can be observed in the image phase information obtained
using the gradient echo sequence. Denote the obtained image phase map asφ, with k-space
representationφ(k). Similarly, letχandχ(k) respectively represent the spatial distribution and
Fourier domain representation of the susceptibility map. The relationship between the measured
phase and underlying susceptibility map are expressed as follows [30]:
φðkÞ¼  wðkÞDðkÞTEgB

where D(k), TE,γ, and B

are the dipole kernel in the Fourier domain, echo time, gyromagnetic

respectively represent the vectors of kspace
in the x-, y-, and z-axes. The center of D(k) was set to zero. Theoretically, the susceptibility
map can be obtained from the phase map simply by inverting the dipole kernel D(k):
wðkÞ¼  φðkÞ=½DðkÞTEgB

However, D(k) vanishes in the conical surface region along the magic angle (54.7°) defined

[31]. Thus,χ(k) at that conical surface region cannot be determined. In addition
, the non-uniform distribution of D(k) results in noise propagation after this inversion.
Both factors contribute to the well-known streaking artifacts commonly observed in QSM
[19,31].
Regularized Approach for QSM
To obtain a stable solution to this ill-posed problem, several nonlinear L1 regularized methods
have been reported for artifact-free QSM [21,24,32–35]. In this study, we used an L1 regularization
with magnitude prior, which is similar to the popular method called morphology enabled
dipole inversion (MEDI) [22,24], which improves conventional L1 regularization to eliminate
both the underestimation of the susceptibility value and the streaking artifacts. The L1 regularization
with magnitude prior involves the following minimization:

Ethics Statement
All animal experimental procedures in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of National Taiwan University and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, and were in compliance with the guidelines for animal care and use set forth by
that Committee. These criteria have been established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, which recognizes that euthanasia is sometimes necessary prior to the scheduled
end of a study, either because of unanticipated complications, or because of the protocol itself.
Furthermore, the euthanasia is necessary when animal meet one of the criterion, including (1)
weight loss, (2) inappetence, (3) weakness or inability to obtain feed or water, (4) moribund
state, (5) infection, and (6) signs of severe organ system dysfunction and non-responsive to
treatment, or with a poor prognosis as determined by a veterinarian. The rat was euthanized by
100% CO

at the end of experiment or one of the criterion that described above-mentioned.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
To study post-stroke rehabilitation, QSM was used in a rat model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) stroke. The detailed procedures of middle cerebral artery (MCA) reperfusion
are described elsewhere [40]. Male Sprague-Dawley rats 7–9 weeks old were intraperitoneally
injected with sodium pentobarbital anesthetic (50 mg/kg-bw [body weight]). The right
eye-to-ear area was then shaved, and the rats were placed in a prone position on a warming
pad at 37°C and incubated with positive-pressure ventilation (0.2 mL/sec) with oxygen using a
small animal ventilator (SAR-830/A; CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA). A 1.5-cm incision was made
on the scalps of the anesthetized rats, at the midpoint between the right eye and right ear. The
temporalis muscle was separated to expose the zygoma and squamosal bones. A dental drill
was used to make a 2-mm2burr hole 1 mm rostral to the anterior junction of the zygoma and
the squamosal bones. The dura mater was carefully pierced with a microsurgical needle. The
exposed MCA was carefully isolated and ligated for 60 min using 10.0 surgical sutures (Johnson
& Johnson Medical, Somerville, NJ, USA) to induce ischemic stroke in the cortex of the right
hemisphere. Isoflurane (2%) was on hand in case the rats woke up during surgery. When the
MCA ligation was complete, the common carotid arteries (CCAs) on both sides were ligated
using aneurysm clips. The ligations on both the CCAs and the MCA were loosened after 60
min. All procedures were completed in two h. All of animals were treated carprofen as

analgesic with the dosage of 5 mg/Kg (s.c., BID) after the post-operative of MCAO. The brain
was dissected and incubated with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) to determine the ischemic
infarct area. For immunohistochemistry, the brains were obtained and then equilibrated in
20% sucrose at 4°C after they had been reperfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Calculating the Ischemic Infarct Area Using TTC Staining
We used TTC staining to determine the infarct area in the brain tissue sections of the Stroke
group (MCA-ligated) rats. Three or 10 days after the MCA had been reperfused, the rats were
euthanized with isoflurane (100% CO
2
) and their brains were removed. The brains were dissected
and collected, frozen at−20°C for 5 min, cut into 2-mm coronal sections, and then
stained with 2% TTC (T8877; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS for 8 min at 37°C.
The stained sections were transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde for immersion fixation for 24 h,
dehydrated in 30% sucrose, and then photographed.
Measuring the Pulse Oxygen Saturation (SpO
2
) in the Infarcted and
Non-Infarcted Areas of the Brain Tissue Sections of the Stroke Rat
The SpO
2
was measured with a pulse oximeter system (Radical; Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA).
After the rats had been anesthetized with 1.5–2% isoflurane gas mixture (20% O
2
;80%N
2
), they
were placed on the animal holder, and the sensor was placed above the infarct and normal areas of
the rat brain, respectively. The SpO
2
was recorded at 30-s intervals for 5 min. The SpO
2
measurement
used here was to examine the trend of the oxygenation level over time in the Stroke group.
MR Data Acquisition for Control Rats
The Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6; male; 8–10 weeks old; weight: 303 ± 4.2 g) were anesthetized
with 2% isoflurane flowing in a gas mixture (O
2
, 20%; N
2
, 80%). Their respiration rate was
monitored and maintained at 50 breaths per min (bpm) with a monitoring and gating system
(SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA). Rectal temperatures (36 ± 0.5°C) were maintained
using a warm-water circulation system. The MR experiments were done using a 7-T animal
MRI scanner (BioSpin 70/30; Bruker GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). A 7-cm linear birdcage volume
coil was used for signal excitation, and a 4-channel phased array was used for signal reception.
T

-WI was acquired using a 3D-GRE first-order flow compensation sequence that
prevents signal dephasing of the laminar flow of blood in vessels. The imaging parameters were
FOV = 38.4 × 25.6 × 12.8 mm3, MTX = 384 × 256 × 128, voxel size = 100 × 100 × 100μm3,TR/
TE = 65.5/15 ms, bandwidth = 25 kHz, and scan time = 36 min. To obtain an acceptable phase
contrast between veins and surrounding tissue, the TE was set as the T
2
 value of the deoxygenated
vessel [41]. The flip angle was set at about 15°-20° to obtain the optimal phase contrast
between the grey and white matter [39]. The large-scale B
0
inhomogeneity was minimized by
region of interest (ROI)-based shimming (provided with the system).
MR Data Acquisition for the MCAO Rat Stroke Model
A 9.4-T animal MRI scanner (BioSpin 94/20; Bruker) was used to visualize the brain tissue sections
of the Sprague-Dawley rats in the Stroke (n = 6) and the Control groups. A 7-cm quadrature
birdcage volume coil was used for signal excitation, and a 4-channel phased array was
used for signal reception. T

-WI was acquired using a 3D-GRE sequence with first-order flow
compensation. The imaging parameters were FOV = 38.4 × 25.6 × 12.8 mm3, MTX = 384 ×

MR Data Processing
Multichannel MR raw data were reconstructed using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA), and then separated into magnitude and phase images. The magnitude images of the
individual channels of the coil array were combined using the sum-of-squares method [42]
(Figure AA inS1 File), and the phase images were assembled using complex summation [43]
(Figure AB inS1 File). Subsequently, the combined magnitude and phase images were used for
QSM and SWI reconstruction.
Fig 1shows an outline of the procedures of QSM reconstruction. First, phase aliasing is
resolved using a phase-unwrapping algorithm. Phase wrapping appears commonly in high-

field imaging when large off-resonance is present and when TE is relatively long. Two phaseunwrapping
methods, path-based in a spatial domain [44,45] and Laplacian-based in a Fourier
domain [32], have been proposed to resolve phase wrap around 2π. Although the Laplacianbased
method is fast, it results significant errors in the vicinity of the vessels. Hence, the best
3D path-based method was used for QSM-mMRV [45]. Second, the unwrapped phaseφ(Fig
1B) was normalized to field perturbationΔB=Δφ/(γTEB
0
). The magnitude images of the rat
brains were manually segmented using MRIcro [46] to generate a brain mask applied toΔB.
Third, a background field induced by air-tissue susceptibility differences and imperfect shimming
was then removed to obtain the internal field b (Fig 1C) using sophisticated harmonic
artifact reduction for phase data (SHARP) [47]. The advantage of the SHARP method over
conventional high-pass filtering is that it can preserve the low-frequency component of the
local phase. The optimal local field using SHARP filtering was accomplished using truncated
singular value decomposition with a radius of 3 voxels (300μm), a shell thickness of 1 voxel
(100μm), and a truncation value of 0.05 as described elsewhere [47]. The radius was determined
by examining the line profile from the reconstructed QSM (L1 regularization withλ=
10−3) and varying the value from 1 to 9 voxels in steps of 2 (Fig 2). A radius of 3 voxels was
used in this study. Because SHARP filtering cannot be computed for voxels that are less than a
radius away from the ROI border, the local field is available only on a modified ROI that is
smaller than the original ROI. In addition, using a radius of 1 voxel caused over-filtering.
Moreover, the truncation value was determined empirically by varying the value from 0.025 to
0.15 in steps of 0.025 and visually inspecting the resultant local field distribution. Finally, the
QSM (Fig 1D) was calculated from b by minimizing the magnitude prior L1 method as Eq (3)
with steepest gradient decent algorithm of 10 iterations. The Lagrange multiplierλdetermines
the smoothness term (kWGχk

) and data consistency term (1

2
) of the
reconstructed susceptibility map such that larger values ofλyield smoother image results than
do smaller ones. In this study, theλ=10 −1.2was selected for the optimal QSM according to the
L-curve criterion [48] by varying theλlogarithmically between 10−4and 100.6(Figure B inS1
File). The binary weighting mask was derived from the magnitude gradient in three directions
(threshold was set to 0.03). For comparison, the conventional L1 regularization QSM was also
optimized using the L-curve criterion (Figure C inS1 File).
For a comparison of vein detection, SWI was reconstructed using the same 3D-GRE data
with a Hann (Hanning) window size of 64 [7](Fig 3).
Image Registration and Statistical Analysis of MRI Data
To quantitatively compare the susceptibility differences of cerebral veins between rats, the susceptibility
value of the cortex was selected as a reference [49]. Subsequently, the brain regions
were registered to a Sprague-Dawley rat brain atlas [50] using the linear registration algorithm
in FSL FLIRT software with affine transformations [51,52]. First, the veins were extracted
(threshold was set toχ>0.05 ppm). Subsequently, the susceptibility values were measured
using an average intensity projection (AIP) of a 25-slice QSM (2.5-mm effective coverage).
Seven ROIs of veins, including the intracortical penetrating venule, middle internal frontal
vein (MIF), longitudinal hippocampal vein (LHIV), medial collicular vein (MCOLV), thalamostriate
vein (THSV), the great cerebral vein (GCV) of Galen, and straight sinus (STS) were
manually drawn and extracted. All measured data are mean ± standard deviation (SD). A coronal
slice of cortical brain was selected to compare the differences in measured vessel sizes
between SWI and QSM. In studying post-stroke revascularization, a 2.5-mm-thick SWI minimum
intensity projection (mIP) and 2.5-mm-thick QSM MIP were used to compare. Significance
was set at p<0.05 (two-tailed ttest).

(Fig 4C), Local field (Fig 4F), and susceptibility (Fig 4I) maps appear visible difference close to
the THSV, LHIV, and TRS vessels. The Laplacian-based unwrapping method yielded an
underestimation of the susceptibility in vessels (p<0.001) over the path-based unwrapping
(Fig 4K). In addition, the accuracy of the local field acquired by the two unwrapping methods
was confirmed and compared using numerical simulations (Figure C inS2 File).
Influence of the Selection of the Lagrange Parameterλ
The magnitude prior L1 and conventional L1 regularizations were both optimized using the
L-curve criterion (Figures B and C inS1 File), and the Lagrange parameters were selected as
10−1.2and 10−1.6for the magnitude prior L1 and the L1 regularized QSM, respectively.Fig 5

quantitative information about the microvessels, but QSM provides the SvO

of the cerebral
vessels. Moreover, the QSM technique eliminates both the blooming artifacts and overestimation
of vessel size, while QSM deconvolved the dipole kernel from the phase image (Fig 7C and
7D).
SWI and QSM images of a coronal slice in the cortical region-show that the distribution of
the intracortical vessels revealed by the two methods are consistent, no significant difference
(p>0.05) in vessel density between SWI (0.0036 ± 0.0011 pixel/mm2) and QSM
(0.0031 ± 0.0008 pixel/mm2), and that the vessels appeared smaller in the QSM image (Fig 8A
and 8B).Fig 8C and 8Dshow enlargements of the white-lined boxes inFig 8A, 8B and 8E
shows quantified vessel cross sectional areas. Quantitative analysis of intracortical venules
shows that SWI estimated that the vessels were significantly (p<0.05)—1.4 times—larger than
estimated by QSM.
Using QSM to Study Post-Stroke Rehabilitation
QSM and SWI were used to study post-stroke rehabilitation in a Stroke group rat 3, 7, and 10
days after the MCAO had been reperfused. TTC staining shows that the infarcted cortical area
shrank from day 3 to day 10 (Fig 9A). A 2.5-mm-thick axial view of mIP using SWI (Fig 9B)
and QSM-estimated SvO
2
maps (Fig 9D) clearly show variations in the cortical venules. The
SvO
2
estimations of the ipsilateral and contralateral vessels from day 3 to day 10 are shown in
Fig 9E. The SvO
2
level of the vessel on the ipsilateral-cortex was significantly lower than that of
the vessel on the contralateral-cortex on day 3 (p<0.05). After the reperfusion, however, the
SvO
2
level of the ipsilateral-cortex climbed, which indicated that the oxyhemoglobin had
reached a plateau on day 7 and 10. This result was comparable with the SpO
2
levels calculated
using the pulse oximeter (Fig 9F).
Discussion
In the present study, we applied QSM to assess cerebral SvO
2
in rat stroke model. The magnitude
prior L1-regularized QSM method was also optimized to provide an accurate estimation
of susceptibility values and to suppress streaking artifacts. Relative to SWI, QSM-mMRV eliminates
the blooming artifacts from the phase image, which reduces overestimations of vessel size
and makes it easy to distinguish intracortical vessels. When used to longitudinally monitor
rehabilitation, the proposed method showed the SvO

measures using the pulse oximeter
standard metric.
The path-based unwrapping algorithm was more reliable for QSM-mMRV than the Laplacian-based
method. We found that the measured susceptibility in veins of the reconstructed
QSM from the unwrapped phase using path-based unwrapping was significantly higher than
the Laplacian-based unwrapping (Fig 4K). The numerical simulation also verified that the
path-based unwrapping algorithm presented the true unwrapped phase in the spatial domain
(Figure C inS2 File). Although studies [32,54–57] have reported using Laplacian-based
unwrapping to successfully reconstruct QSM, it might cause an incorrect calculation near the
vessels [32,54,55].
One challenge of QSM reconstruction is to select an appropriate value of the Lagrange multiplier
(λ) and the prior information. In conventional L1 regularization,λcontrols the fidelity
of the reconstructed QSM. A largeλenforces minimization of the L1 norm term, which eliminates
noise. In contrast, a smallλenforces data fidelity at the cost of streaking artifacts.λis
usually determined according to the L-curve criterion for the optimal QSM [48]. However, L1
regularization is usually underestimated [21,23,26,56]. In the present study, the magnitude
prior L1 approach allows us to simultaneously suppress streaking artifacts and to prevent an
over-smoothing QSM. In addition, the chosen prior information also influences the accuracy

in reconstructed QSM [23,34,35]. Herein, the estimated susceptibility values were measured by
varying the threshold of the magnitude gradient from 0 to 1 in the step of 0.01 (Fig 10). There
were no significant differences between these QSMs (Fig 10C). However, the measured susceptibility
declined with a larger threshold value (Fig 10D).
We found that, at baseline, the SvO
2
in several major veins (MIF, LHIV, MCOLV, THSV,
GCV, and STS) had a mean of 86.23%, which was higher than other SvO
2
measurements of
~70% [17,58]. The overestimation of SvO
2
(i.e., underestimation of susceptibility value) may be
caused by partial volume effects. To date, the weighted L1 regularization was the most appropriate
method of QSM reconstruction [1]. However, the partial volume effect resulted in an
18.6–33.8% underestimation of susceptibility (i.e., 10–16.6% relative overestimation of SvO
2
)
according to our simulation (Table A inS3 File). Most of the quantified susceptibility values
(~0.2 ppm) were about 33% lower than the true value (0.3 ppm) (Table A inS3 File). Thus, a
correction factor of approximately 1.5 could be obtained for adjusting the SvO
2
quantification
in this study. Note that the quantified values depend on the size and the geometry of object, as
well as TE. These critical factors should be considered carefully for future applications.Table 1
shows the 1-SvO
2
ranged from roughly 10% to 18%. If the 1-SvO
2
multiplies a correct factor of
1.5, the resultant 1-SvO
2
were about 15–27%, which lead to oxygen level of 73–85%. This result
after multiplying a correction factor is close to the SvO
2
of ~70% reported by previous works
[17,58]. The error due to partial volume effect could be improved by a recent method [59].
Furthermore, SvO
2
estimates were calculated based on the association between the susceptibility
differences of fully oxygenated and fully deoxygenated blood (Δχ

Another error of this method is the choice of hematocrit value. We always assumed that
Hct = 0.4 [38] in the present study. However, hematocrit varies between individuals (0.35–0.5)
[13] and also depends upon vessel size [64].
QSM-mMRV was used to demonstrate its ability to longitudinally monitor the rehabilitation
of a post-stroke rat. At 3 days after reperfusion, the SvO
2
value of the ipsilateral cortex had
significantly declined relative to the contralateral cortex, which agreed with a prior study [29].
At 7 and 10 days post reperfusion, the SvO
2
value of ipsilateral cortex had gradually risen to
the level of the contralateral cortex (p>0.05), which indicated that the physiology of the poststroke
rat brain had almost recovered. These results are similar to those of a study [65] that
used MRI to quantitatively observe the angiogenesis of a post-stroke rat brain. Moreover, we
compared our SvO
2
results with SpO
2
measurements. Both of the blood oxygen values had
gradually climbed after reperfusion. Relative to pulse oximeter, QSM-mMRV provided high
spatial resolution and better penetration depth when measuring blood oxygen. In addition, we
also found, in immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of vessel cells, that the angiogenesis of

the ipsilateral cortex area was greater 7 and 10 days after reperfusion (image not shown), and
that the tendency of variation in angiogenesis was consistent with the QSM-mMRV and SvO
2
measurements. Thus, we concluded that QSM-mMRV showed promise as a potential noninvasive
observation tool for clinical applications.
The benefit of QSM-mMRV is using an intrinsic contrast agent (e.g., deoxy-hemoglobin) to
detect the structural and quantitative information of venous vessels, and it is useful for longitudinal
studies of vascular disease models. Many studies have investigated the microvascular structure
and function using MRA methods: time-of-flight (TOF)-, phase-contrast (PC)-,ΔR
2
-, and
ΔR
2
-MRA [5,66–68]. TOF-MRA is widely used to visualize major arteries [5]. PC-MRA, based
on calculating the phase shift, enables the visualization of arteries and veins [66]. Although both
TOF- and PC-MRA provide structural and flow information, their ability to visualize microvessels
is limited.ΔR
2
-MRA has been proposed to detect microvascular arterioles and venules and
obtain cerebral blood volume (CBV) [67]. Nevertheless, iron-based contrast agents are problematic
because of their availability, cost, and safety. Recent methods based onΔR
2
-MRA use blood
oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast to detect venules and regional CBV [68]. Nonetheless,
by acquiring two sets of 3D-GRE images under different inhalation conditions,ΔR
2
-MRA is
limited by its lengthy scan time (~76-min for an MR scan with two inhalation conditions) and
difficult to use clinically.
QSM-mMRV simultaneously depicts vein architecture and provides quantitative information
on SvO
2
. It does, however, have one limitation. QSM-mMRV based on a GRE sequence
magnifies vessel size because of intravascular and extravascular dephasing. Park et al. [69]
reported that the intracortical vessels (diameter:80μm) can be observed using 3D-GRE
images. Ogawa and Lee [70] reported that the susceptibility effect caused the visual vessels to
look twice their normal size in GRE images. This magnification in the magnitude of GRE
images is caused by the extravascular dephasing component that depends on TE, field strength,
vessel orientation, and voxel size. Relative to the magnitude of GRE images, recent studies on
intracerebral microbleeds [71] and stroke [72] report that the visualized size from QSM is independent
of TE.
Conclusions
We have described a QSM-based microscopic MRV combined with QSM reconstruction for in
vivoquantitative visualization of the architecture of small venous vessels in rat stroke model.
The QSM corrects the nonlocal effects observed in SWI. Corrected by simulation results, the
SvO
2
estimated by QSM is ranged from 73% to 85% for healthy rats. The approach simultaneously
offers cerebral in vivomicrovascular structure and SvO
2
measures, which can be used
to evaluate the physiological and functional characteristics of microvascular changes over time.
This technique might be further applied to monitor animal models or clinical patients with
cerebrovascular disease.
