Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a pathological condition in 
which the upper airway collapses during sleep to partially 
(hypopnea) or completely (apnea) restrict the movement of air 
into the lungs during inhalation.1 With the onset of hypopnea 
or apnea, the ventilatory effort increases, producing arousal to a 
lighter stage of sleep where a patent airway can be reestablished.2
In extreme cases, the airway can repeatedly collapse throughout 
sleep at rates exceeding 100 apneas per hour. Each episode of 
apnea produces progressive hypoxia, progressive hypercapnia, 
arousal from sleep, and a negative intrathoracic pressure as the 
breathing effort continues against a closed airway.1
OSA is an independent risk factor or is closely associated
with several cardiovascular (including cerebrovascular) 
diseases.1,3–9 However, the role of OSA in the development 
of one cerebrovascular disease, cerebral small vessel disease 
(CSVD), has not been extensively studied. CSVD is characterized
by pathology of the small penetrating vessels supplying 
subcortical structures, leading to blood–brain barrier (BBB) 
disruption, neuroinflammation, lacunar infarcts, microbleeds
, and cognitive dysfunction.10–13 Although studies 
have not directly focused on OSA as a potential contributor 
to CSVD development or progression per se, several studies 
have attempted to determine whether OSA is associated with 
CSVD-like injuries to the brain, that is, brain injuries that can, 
but not necessarily, result from CSVD. Even then, some find 
an association between OSA and CSVD-like brain pathologies
,14–18 whereas others find no association.19–22
To better understand the relationship between OSA and 
CSVD, we studied spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone 
rats (SHRSP), a CSVD model that closely mimics the pathological
events occurring in human CSVD.23 We tested the hypothesis
that apneas during the sleep cycle exacerbate hypertension 
and accelerate pathological changes that occur with CSVD. We 
used a model of OSA, where a balloon, chronically implanted 
in the trachea, was remotely inflated to produce 60 apneas per 
hour (considered severe in humans) for 8 hours of the sleep 
cycle.24,25 We evaluated the rats for CSVD-related pathological 
changes, including increases in systolic blood pressure, disruption
of the BBB, neuroinflammation, white matter integrity, 
and cognitive deficits. We show that OSA in SHRSP rats leads 
to exacerbated hypertension, decreased BBB integrity, microglia
activation, and cognitive impairment.
Abstract—We tested the hypothesis that apneas during the sleep cycle exacerbate hypertension and accelerate changes that 
occur with cerebral small vessel disease. Obstructive sleep apnea was modeled by intermittent inflations of a chronically 
implanted tracheal balloon to occlude the airway during the sleep cycle (termed OSA) in spontaneously hypertensive 
stroke-prone (SHRSP) rats, a model of cerebral small vessel disease. SHRSP rats and their parent strain, Wistar Kyoto 
(WKY) rats, were exposed to OSA for 2 weeks (from 9 to 11 or from 18 to 20 weeks). At 9 weeks, hypertension was 
developing in the SHRSP rats and was firmly established by 18 weeks. OSA exposure increased systolic blood pressure 
in SHRSP rats by ≈30 mmHg in both age groups compared with shams that were surgically prepared but not exposed 
to OSA (P<0.05). OSA exposure also increased systolic blood pressure in WKY rats by 20 and 37 mmHg at 11 and 20 
weeks, respectively (P<0.05). OSA exposure in SHRSP rats compromised blood–brain barrier integrity in white matter 
at both 11 and 20 weeks of age when compared with SHRSP sham rats (P<0.05). Microglia were activated in SHRSP 
rats exposed to OSA but not in sham rats at 11 weeks (P<0.05). At 20 weeks, microglia were activated in sham SHRSP 
rats (P<0.05) compared with WKY sham rats and were not further activated by OSA. Neither was blood–brain barrier 
integrity altered nor microglia activated in any of the WKY groups. We conclude that OSA accelerates the onset of 
the cerebral pathologies associated with cerebral small vessel disease in SHRSP, but not WKY, rats. (Hypertension.

Methods
A complete description of the methods can be found in the onlineonly
Data Supplement. All studies were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Baylor College of Medicine. 
Male inbred SHRSP and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were maintained 
on a regular rodent chow diet and housed in a satellite facility with 
12-hour light (0600–1800 h) and 12-hour dark (1800 to 0600 h) cycle.
At either 8 or 17 weeks of age, rats were prepared with a chronically
implanted intratracheal balloon that could be remotely inflated 
to occlude the trachea to model OSA.24,25 One week was allowed for 
recovery from the surgical procedure. Rats were subjected to repeated 
apneas (60 apneas per hour for 8 hours during the sleep cycle, with 
each apnea lasting 10 s). The repeated apneas continued during the 
sleep cycle for 2 weeks. Sham rats were instrumented with the balloon
implants, but did not undergo any apneas.
Systolic blood pressure was measured using tail-cuff plethysmography.
BBB integrity was assessed by the extravasation of Evans blue 
dye after an IV injection and by extravasation of immunoglobulin 
G (IgG), a protein found only in plasma when the BBB is intact. 
Astrocytes were visualized with an antibody directed against GFAP, 
and microglia were visualized using an antibody directed against Iba-
1. Morphometric analysis was used to determine the activation state 
of microglia as previously described.26 The Kluver Barrera method 
was used to visualize white matter from brain sections. The novel 
object recognition test27,28 was used to determine working memory 
by measuring the ability of each rat to discriminate between a novel
object and an object previously presented to the rat.
Parametric data are expressed as mean±SEM, and nonparametric 
data are presented using box and whisker plots with median values. 
Differences between groups were determined using 2-way repeated 
measures ANOVA or ANOVA on ranks followed by a Holm–Sidak 
test when appropriate. Differences were considered as statistically 
significant if P≤0.05.
Results
Figure 1 shows systolic blood pressures for SHRSP and WKY 
rats before and after 2 weeks of OSA or sham. Systolic blood 
pressure was significantly greater in the SHRSP rats at all times 
compared with the WKY rats. Hypertension was still developing
in the SHRSP rats at 9 weeks (Figure 1A), as noted in the 
SHRSP shams, but had plateaued by 18 weeks of age (Figure 1B; 
also see Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement). In both 
strains and at both ages, OSA significantly increased systolic 
blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure increased by 20 and 37 
mmHg at 11 and 20 weeks in the WKY rats after OSA when 
compared with the corresponding WKY sham rats, respectively.
In the SHRSP rats, systolic blood pressures were 28 and 
32 mmHg greater in OSA rats compared with shams rats at 11 
and 20 weeks, respectively. Thus, OSA increased systolic blood 
pressure in both strains in both age groups.
Weight changes for all groups of rats are shown in Figure 
S2. BBB permeability as measured by Evans blue extravasation
after an IV infusion is shown in Figure 2. Evans blue 
extravasation was significantly increased after OSA in white 
matter at 11 weeks in the SHRSP rats compared with the sham 
rats (Figure 2B). Although not statistically significant, the 
data suggest a potential increase in extravasation at 20 weeks 
in white and gray matter in SHRSP rats undergoing OSA 
(P=0.14 and 0.08, respectively). There were no significant differences
in Evans blue extravasation in WKY rats as a result 
of OSA in either age groups (Figure 2A).
Figure S3 shows extravasation of IgG from arterioles in 
OSA and sham rats for both strains and at both ages. Note 
the IgG (green fluorescence) surrounding the arterioles in the 
SHRSP rat after OSA at 11 weeks, with even greater extravasation
shown in the same group at 20 weeks of age. Figure 3 
summarizes the results for IgG extravasation. No IgG extravasation
occurred in SHRSP sham rats at 11 weeks of age or in 
WKY rats in any of the groups. Although not statistically significant
, there is a suggestion for BBB disruption in SHRSP 
rats after OSA at 11 weeks of age (Figure S3; Figure 3). By 20 
weeks of age, the SHRSP rats were showing BBB disruption 
in the sham group, and OSA increased this even further.
Figure S4 shows microglia (green) at 11 weeks of age. 
Microglia activation was assessed using a categorical scale 
from 1 to 4, where 1 was unactivated microglia and 4 was 
highly activated microglia.26 Figure 4 shows a boxplot summary
of the results for microglia activation. In the cingulate 
gyrus, microglia activation was significantly greater in the 
SHRSP sham rats at 11 weeks compared with WKY sham 
rats at the same age. The microglia were further activated, 
but not significantly, by OSA in the SHRSP rats at 11 weeks. 
Microglia were significantly activated by OSA in the corpus 
callosum and external capsule at 11 weeks in the SHRSP rats

when compared with SHRSP sham rats or WKY sham rats. At 
20 weeks of age, all 3 white matter regions showed increased 
microglia activation in the SHRSP sham rats compared with 
WKY rats, and OSA did not further increase the microglia 
activation. WKY rats did not show an increase in microglia 
activation resulting from OSA in either age group.
Figure S5 shows that OSA did not produce any quantifiable 
decrease of myelin basic protein (Western blotting) with either 
aging from 9 to 20 weeks or OSA treatment. Additionally, we 
did not observe any astrogliosis as determined using GFAP 
fluorescence (Figure S6). OSA did not produce disruption of 
the white matter tracks as determined by the Kluver Barrera 
staining method in either strain, regardless of age or treatment 
(Figure S7A). However, we did see white matter damage in 
SHRSP rats when 1% NaCl was added to the drinking water 
from age 12 to 17 weeks, with OSA occurring from 18 to 20 
weeks (Figure S7B). These salt-loaded SHRSP rats served as 
a positive control for white matter damage.
Figure 5 shows results of the novel object recognition test 
in SHRSP sham and OSA rats at 11 and 20 weeks of age. 
Neither the WKY OSA nor the WKY sham rats explored, and 
thus, they were not included in the results of the novel object 
recognition test. Note that during the training session, rats 
tended to spend equal time between objects as indicated by 
the discrimination ratio near 0. The SHRSP sham rats at both 
ages spent more time with the novel object during the working 
session as indicated by a positive discrimination ratio (≈0.3 
for both age groups). However, after OSA, the SHRSP in both 
age groups did not recognize the novel object as indicated by 
the discrimination ratios near 0.
Discussion
OSA initiates a pathological cascade that consists of sympathetic
activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial
dysfunction, and metabolic disorders.1 Given that this 
cascade has similarities to the risk factors associated with 
CSVD,12,13,17,29 we tested the hypothesis that apneas during the 
sleep cycle exacerbate hypertension and accelerate pathological
changes that occur with CSVD. The specific neuropathological
changes included neuroinflammation, BBB integrity, 
white matter integrity, and cognitive function. If our hypothesis
is valid, then 2 weeks of OSA (9–11 weeks) in 11-weekold
SHRSP rats should produce similar pathological changes 
that occurred with the aging process from 11 to 20 weeks in 
SHRSP sham rats (ie, not undergoing apneas). Consistent with 
our hypothesis, we demonstrated that both aging and OSA in 
SHRSP rats increased systolic blood pressure (Figure S1; 
Figure 1), accelerated breakdown of the BBB (Figures 2 and 
3; Figure S3), and activated microglia (Figure 4; Figure S4). 
At 20 weeks of age, OSA further damaged the BBB and further
increased systolic blood pressure. Microglia of 20 week 
SHRSP sham rats were already activated and were not further 
activated by OSA (Figure 4). Additionally, we observed that 
SHRSP rats exposed to OSA had cognitive deficits that were 
not observed in sham rats at either age (Figure 5). Thus, cognitive
changes occurring with OSA in SHRSP rats exceeded any 
cognitive changes, if they occurred, between 9 and 20 weeks 
of age in sham SHRSP rats. The above changes resulting from 
OSA in SHRSP rats are consistent with our hypothesized 
changes.
We did not observe damage to deep brain structures, 
including disorganization or disarray of white matter tracts, 
white matter loss, microinfarcts, microbleeds, or astrogliosis, 
in any SHRSP rats, regardless of age or treatment (Figures 
S5–S7). As the complications of CSVD progress in SHRSP 
rats or in humans, white matter is damaged and ultimately 
lost.12,13,23,29 Histologically, white matter tracks can be seen to 
be disturbed, and myelin basic protein, a major constituent of 
white matter, can be significantly decreased.
SHRSP rats on a conventional diet begin to develop subcortical
lesions and loss of white matter starting around 20 
weeks of age or older depending on the colony or laboratory 
conducting the studies.23 However, when placed on a high Na+/
low K+ diet, 1% NaCl in drinking water, and perfusion deficits
produced by carotid artery ligation, the disease process 
can be dramatically accelerated to the point where subcortical
lesions and loss of white matter occur by 20 weeks.23,29

We were expecting OSA to accelerate the disease process in 
SHRSP rats (especially at 20 weeks of age) to a similar degree. 
However, our expectations that subcortical lesions, including 
disorganization and loss of white matter, would result from 
OSA did not materialize (Figures S5 and S7A), except in rats 
which were salt-loaded (Figure S7B). We speculate that OSA, 
without salt loading, was not sufficiently severe or sufficiently 
prolonged to produce deep brain lesions or white matter damage.
Salt loading seemed to provide the additional stress necessary
to produce damage to subcortical structures.
In WKY rats, the parent strain for the SHRSP, blood pressures
increased in both age groups as a result of OSA exposure
(Figure 1); however, no damage to the BBB or activation 
of microglia was observed (Figures 2–4). Unfortunately, the 
WKY rats would not explore and, as a result, could not be 
used in the novel object recognition test. We note that when 
Long–Evans rats were exposed to OSA using the same model, 
we did not observe any increase in blood pressure even when 
the OSA was extended from 2 weeks to 2 months (Durgan 
et al24, Crossland et al,25 and unpublished observations). Two 
apparently normal strains of rats, WKY and Long–Evans, had 
different blood pressure responses when exposed to OSA.
When taking the results as a whole, OSA in SHRSP rats, 
an animal model for CSVD, accelerated the onset of the cerebral
pathologies and exacerbated pathological changes associated
with CSVD. Several of our end points for this study, 
including loss of BBB integrity and neuroinflammation, are 
considered events leading to lesions in subcortical regions of 
the brain in CSVD.23,30,31
In this study, we did not attempt to delineate the exact role 
of the relative increase in blood pressure stemming from OSA 
as it related to BBB damage and microglia activation. We note 
that hypertension is an integral part of CSVD in many individuals
and may constitute a particular inheritable form of 
CSVD.12,32,33
Perspective
Our study provides strong evidence that OSA, at least in an 
animal model, accelerates the disease process involving CSVD. 
Our data also suggests that relatively short periods of OSA can 
exacerbate and accelerate the onset of CSVD. Although translating
2 weeks of OSA in a rat model to an equivalent time 
in humans is impractical, the results do point to the idea that 
OSA, even for short periods of time, could accelerate or exacerbate
the effects of CSVD, especially in those individuals with 
associated risk factors. The most effective treatment for OSA 
is continuous positive airway pressure, which provides pressure
by a mask placed over the nose or nose and mouth to prevent
the airway from collapsing. If continuous positive airway 
pressure is an effective treatment for prevention of CSVD and 
allows reversal of CSVD, then early diagnoses and treatment of 
OSA is extremely important. One encouraging study, although 
limited in size, reported that cognitive impairments and white 
matter damage in individuals having OSA could be reversed 
after 1 year of continuous positive airway pressure treatment.15
Given that there are few studies dealing with the potential risks 
of OSA on the development and acceleration of CSVD and that 
OSA may be a potential modifiable risk factor or treatment for 
CSVD, this area deserves more in-depth studies.

What Is New?
•	This study demonstrates that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) accelerates 
the pathological consequences of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).
•	Only 2 weeks of OSA, a relatively short period of time, was needed to significantly
increase systolic blood pressure, produce significant damage 
to the blood–brain barrier, enhance microglia activation, and produce 
cognitive dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, 
a strain that recapitulates the pathological changes occurring with human
CSVD.
•	OSA was modeled in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats 
and their parent strain, Wistar Kyoto rats, by remotely inflating a balloon, 
chronically implanted in the trachea, during 8 hours of the sleep cycle 
each day.
What Is Relevant?
•	The exact cause and effect relationship between OSA and cardiovascular 
diseases has been difficult to fully understand in humans because of the 
heterogeneity of the study population in terms of confounding comorbidities
, genetic makeup, age, life styles, and sex.
•	Animal models of OSA, where the confounding comorbidities can be 
more tightly controlled, have been instrumental in overcoming the heterogeneity
of human subjects being studied.
•	Although OSA seems to be an independent risk factor for stroke and 
hypertension, its relationship to other cardiovascular diseases, such as 
CSVD, is less clear.
•	We used an animal model to demonstrate that OSA accelerates the disease
process involving CSVD, and only relatively short periods of time, 
where apneas occur during the sleep cycle, are needed to exacerbate 
and accelerate the progression of CSVD.
Summary
OSA accelerates the onset of the cerebral pathologies associated 
with CSVD in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, a model 
for human CSVD. Our study provides strong evidence that OSA accelerates
the disease process involving CSVD, and only relatively short 
periods of OSA are needed. In humans, early diagnosis and treatment 
for OSA is especially important in individuals having CSVD.
