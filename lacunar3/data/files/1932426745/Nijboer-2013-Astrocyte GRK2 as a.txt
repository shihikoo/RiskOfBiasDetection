G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2) regulates cellular signalingviadesensitization of GPCRs and
by direct interaction with intracellular signaling molecules. We recently described that ischemic brain injury decreases
cerebral GRK2 levels. Here we studied the effect of astrocyte GRK2-deficiency on neonatal brain damage
in vivo. As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamateviaplasma-membrane transporters, we also studied
the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST).
Brain damage induced by hypoxia–ischemiawas significantlyreduced in GFAP-GRK2+/−mice, whichhave a 60%
reduction in astrocyte GRK2 compared to GFAP-WT littermates. In addition, GRK2-deficient astrocytes have
higher plasma-membrane levels of GLAST and an increased capacity to take up glutamate in vitro.
In search for the mechanism by which GRK2 regulates GLAST expression, we observed increased GFAP levels in
GRK2-deficient astrocytes. GFAP and the cytoskeletal protein ezrin are known regulators of GLAST localization.
In line with this evidence, GRK2-deficiency reduced phosphorylation of the GRK2 substrate ezrin and enforced
plasma-membrane GLAST association after stimulation with the group I mGluR-agonist DHPG. When ezrin was
silenced, the enhanced plasma-membrane GLAST association in DHPG-exposed GRK2-deficient astrocytes was
prevented.
In conclusion, we identified a novel role of astrocyte GRK2 in regulating plasma-membrane GLAST localization via an ezrin-dependent route. We demonstrate that the 60% reduction in astrocyte GRK2 protein level
that is observed in GFAP-GRK2+/− mice is sufficient to significantly reduce neonatal ischemic brain damage.
Thesefindings underline the critical role of GRK2 regulation in astrocytes for dampening the extent of brain
damage after ischemia.

Introduction
Astrocytes form the largest glial cell population in the brain; they
outnumber neurons by 5 times and comprise ~50% of human brain volume
(Rossi et al., 2007; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Astrocytes provide
metabolic support for neurons and regulate the extracellular ion
balance (Rossi et al., 2007; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010; Takano et al.,
2009). Under pathological conditions like cerebral ischemia, astrocytes
are thought to contribute to preventing neuronal cell death by reducing
extracellular glutamate to non-excitotoxic levels (Swanson et al., 2004;
Takano et al., 2009). They do so by enveloping neuronal synapses
with processes that express the glutamate transporters GLAST and
GLT-1, which remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft (Rothstein
et al., 1994). Genetic ablation, pharmacological inhibition or antisense
oligonucleotide-mediated downregulation of GLAST or GLT-1
exacerbate excitotoxic neurodegeneration or ischemic brain injury
in rodents (Rao et al., 2001; Rothstein et al., 1996; Watase et al.,
1998). Conversely, increasing the expression of glutamate transporters
has been shown to be neuroprotective in in vitro models of
ischemic damage and anin vivomodel of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(Fontana et al., 2007; Rothstein et al., 2005). Collectively, these
data indicate a neuroprotective role of astrocytes by glutamate uptake via their glutamate transporters.
G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a widely expressed kinase
that regulates phosphorylation and subsequent desensitization of
multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Desensitization of GPCRs is a crucial regulatory
process to ensure attenuation of signaling and internalization of

receptors to prevent cellular overstimulation (Gainetdinov et al.,
2004; Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006). GRK2 also regulates signaling
via direct interaction with intracellular signaling molecules like p38
MAP kinase, MEK1/2, PI3 kinase and the cAMP sensor Epac (Eijkelkamp
et al., 2010b; Kavelaars et al., 2011; Kleibeuker et al., 2008; Peregrin et
al., 2006; Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006; Ribas et al., 2007). Moreover, cytoskeletal
proteins like tubulin, radixin and ezrin have also been shown to
be substrates for GRK2 (Cant and Pitcher, 2005; Kahsai et al., 2010;
Pitcher et al., 1998).
The cytoskeleton is an organized network of proteinfibers, consisting
of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediatefilaments, which provide
shape, strength, movement and intracellular transport of cell organelles.
The intermediatefilament glialfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an
astrocyte-specific cytoskeletal protein and it is widely acknowledged
that GFAP levels are upregulated in response to astrocyte activation.
A recent study by Sullivan et al. (2007) suggested an essential role
for GFAP in regulating glutamate transporter trafficking and function.
These authors suggested that GFAP plays a role in retaining
GLAST in the plasma-membrane via a mechanism depending on the
adaptor proteins ezrin and NHERF1 (Na+–H+ exchanger regulatory
factor 1).
The aim of this study was to determine whether a reduction in astrocyte
GRK2 affects the capacity of astrocytes to regulate glutamate
uptake as well as hypoxic–ischemic brain damage in vivo. In search
for the mechanism by which GRK2 might regulate glutamate homeostasis
, we studied the effects of GRK2-deficiency on GLAST expression
and on GFAP and ezrin, two possible regulators of GLAST localization.
Materials and methods
Animal experiments: breeding, HI brain damage and histology
Experiments were performed in accordance with national guidelines
and were approved by the UMC Utrecht-Experimental Animal
Care Committee.
We used heterozygous GRK2+/−and wildtype (WT) C57BL/6J littermates
(Jaber et al., 1996). Mice with cell-specific reduction of GRK2 in astrocytes
were obtained using Cre-Lox technology using GFAP-Cre+/−
(FVB-Tg(GFAP-cre)25Mes/J (Jackson Laboratory)) and GRK2f/f mice on
a mixed 129/C57BL/6J background (Matkovich et al., 2006). Pups had either
normal GRK2 levels (GFAP-WT) or reduced GRK2 levels in astrocytes
(GFAP-GRK2+/−)( Eijkelkamp et al., 2010a).
Hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain damage was induced on postnatal
day 9 (P9) in mouse pups of both sexes by permanent occlusion of
the right carotid artery followed by 45 min at 10% O
2
. This model induces
neuronal damage in primarily the hippocampus and also in the
cortical and thalamic regions of the brain as we described before
(Nijboer et al., 2008; van der Kooij et al., 2010). Neuronal damage
was quantified as loss of staining for microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP2) as described earlier (Nijboer et al., 2008).
Paraffin-embedded sections cut at hippocampal level (−1.8 mm
from bregma) were stained with mouse-anti-GFAP (Acris, Herford,
Germany) followed by biotinylated horse-anti-mouse antibody (Vector
laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Visualization was performed using
Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzamidine
(DAB).
For immunofluorescent detection of GRK2 levels in astrocytes and
neurons, brain sections were incubated with mouse-anti-GFAP (Acris),
mouse-anti-MAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and rabbitanti-GRK2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by
Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Photographs were obtained using a Zeiss
Apotomefluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). GRK2
levels in GFAP-positive cells were quantified using Image J software
(http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2006).
Primary astrocyte cultures and subcellular protein fractionation
P1 pups were used to obtain mixed primary cultures of cortical astrocytes
and microglia as described earlier (Nijboer et al., 2010). In
short, both cortices of one animal were isolated, dissected and cultured
separately resulting in a mixed primary culture of astrocytes and microglia.
After 10–12 DIV, these mixed cultures were shaken for 3 h to
detach the microglia that were discarded thereafter. The purity of the
astrocyte culture was >95% GFAP-positive cells. For further experiments
, astrocyte cultures from 10 to 14 animals per genotype were
pooled per genotype and were cultured for 48 h in poly-L-ornithine
coated 24-well plates at a density of 0.4×106 cells/ml to reach 90%
confluency before the experimental procedures. Astrocytes were
stimulated for 10 min with 50 μM 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG;
Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) at 37 °C.
Cytosol and plasma-membrane fractions were prepared as described
earlier (Lombardi et al., 1999). In short, cells were homogenized in
ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors
) followed by centrifugation at 800 gfor 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was centrifuged at 48.000 g for 20min at 4°C to obtain crude
cytosolic fractions containing intracellular vesicle membranes. Pellets
containing plasma-membrane fractions were homogenized in ice-cold
buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100
and protease inhibitors.
Total cell lysates of astrocytes or microglia were prepared as
described earlier (Nijboer et al., 2010).
Glutamate uptake assay
Glutamate uptake was measured as described byTavares et al. (2002).
Astrocytes were incubated in HBSS supplemented with 5 mM Hepes
for 15 min at 37 °C. Uptake was started by adding 0.33 μCi/ml of
L-[3H]glutamate (GE Healthcare; Eindhoven, The Netherlands) mixed
with unlabeled L-glutamate to afinal concentration of 100 μM. After incubation
of 0–10 min at 37 °C, uptake was terminated by two washes
with ice-cold HBSS, immediately followed by cell lysis with 0.1 N
NaOH/0.01% SDS for 15 min on ice. Aliquots were taken for protein
assay prior to liquid scintillation counting.
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting
WT astrocytes were homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing
20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA (pH 8), 137 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Homogenates were
centrifuged at 14.000 gfor 15 min at 4 °C and supernatants were used
for immunoprecipitation. Brains were homogenized in ice-cold buffer
containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 and protease
inhibitors using Ultra-Turrax T25 and were incubated for 4 h at
4 °C under gentle rotation. Homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min
at 30.000 g at 4 °C and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation.
Immunoprecipitation was performed as described earlier using
5 μg mouse-anti-GRK2 antibody (Millipore, Watford, UK) or control
anti-mouse IgG (IgG2a kappa) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (Eijkelkamp
et al., 2010a).
Total brain homogenates of adult or P9 mice were made as
described earlier (Nijboer et al., 2007).
Proteins samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal,
the Netherlands). Membranes were stained with rabbit-anti-GRK2
(dilution 1:1000), mouse-anti-ezrin (dilution 1:500), goat-anti-β-actin
(dilution 1:2000) (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit-anti-calreticulin

(dilution 1:500) (Abcam) followed by incubation with HRP-labeled secondary
antibodies. Specific bands were visualized by chemiluminescence
(ECL; Amersham Biosciences) with X-rayfilm exposure, scanned
with a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer and analyzed with Quantity One
Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)
To knockdown ezrin in astrocytes we used 21-base pairs, annealed
siRNA duplexes with 2 UU overhangs (5′-CAAGAAGGCACCUGACUUU-3′
or scrambled control; Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO)
(Rasmussen et al., 2008) and Astrocytes Transfection Reagent (Altogen
Biosystems, Las Vegas, NV) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
After 48 h, silencing of ezrin was confirmed by Western Blotting and astrocytes
were used for DHPG stimulation (see above).
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean and SEM. T-test, or two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests was used to analyze the effect of
genotype or genotype and time/treatment.
Results
Effect of low GRK2 in astrocytes on ischemic brain damage
To determine the contribution of astrocyte GRK2 to brain damage, we
used GFAP-WT and GFAP-GRK2+/− mice in this study. We have previously
shown that GFAP-GRK2+/−mice have a cell-specific 60% reduction
in GRK2 protein in astrocytes, whereas GRK2 levels in microglia are not
affected compared to GFAP-WT littermates (Eijkelkamp et al., 2010a). In
addition we show here that neuronal levels of GRK2 are similar in
GFAP-WT and GFAP-GRK2+/−brains (Fig. 1A).
We induced hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain damage in P9 GFAP-WT
and GFAP-GRK2+/− mice by permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion
and hypoxia and neuronal damage was analyzed as loss of ipsilateral
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining. Neuronal
damage is significantly reduced in GFAP-GRK2+/− mice as compared
to GFAP-WT littermate controls at all time points tested (Figs. 1B and
C). Fig. 1C shows that at 3 h after the insult MAP2 loss is apparent in
the hippocampal area. At 48 h after the insult, MAP2 loss is also visible
in the cortical areas and the thalamic region. At 3 weeks after HI, a
cystic infarct has formed with loss of hippocampal and thalamic area
in the GFAP-GRK2+/−animals and loss of hippocampal, thalamic and
large cortical area loss in GFAP-WT animals. MAP2 loss did not further
increase between 48 h and 3 weeks after induction of HI in both
genotypes (Figs. 1B and C), indicating that maximal loss of MAP2
was obtained already at 48 h after the insult.
Brain sectionsstained forGRK2 and GFAPshow reduced (44%) levels
of GRK2 in GFAP-positive cells in HI-brains compared to sham-control
brains at 3 h post-HI, indicating that the level of GRK2 is actually
reduced in astrocytes after HIin vivo(Fig. 1D).
Functional consequences of low astrocyte GRK2 for plasma-membrane
GLAST expression and glutamate uptake
Next, we investigated whether GRK2-deficiency affected levels of
glutamate transporters at the astrocyte plasma-membrane. We observed
that primary cultures of astrocytes from P1 mice express
GLAST. The GLT-1 glutamate transporter was not detectable in
these cultures (Fig. 2A, left panel) which is in line with other studies
(Beaulé et al., 2009; Guillet et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2001). GLAST
and GLT-1 were both highly expressed in the adult mouse brain
with a higher expression of GLT-1 as was earlier described by
Lehre and Danbolt (1998) (Fig. 2A, left panel). In the immature
mouse brain at P9 however, GLAST is the predominant glutamate
transporter, with lower levels of GLT-1 expression (Fig. 2A, right
panels). No differences in total GLAST levels were observed between
WT and GRK2+/− and GFAP-WT and GFAP-GRK2+/− mouse brains
at P9.
Primary astrocyte cultures were fractionated into a plasmamembrane
protein fraction and a cytosol/intracellular vesicle membraneproteinfraction.ThepresenceofNa +/K+ ATPase and the absence
of calreticulin in the plasma membrane fraction confirm that
the plasma-membrane fraction is not contaminated with ER vesicles
(Fig. 2B; upper part). Plasma-membrane GLAST levels were significantly
higher in GRK2-deficient astrocytes as compared to WT astrocytes.
GLAST levels in the cytosol/intracellular vesicle fraction seemed to be
decreased in GRK2-deficient astrocytes compared to WT cells, but this
did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2B).
Next, we determined whether the increased expression of GLAST in
GRK2-deficient astrocytes had functional consequences for glutamate
uptake capacity. The capacity of both WT and GRK2-deficient astrocytes
to take up glutamate was analyzed by using a 3H-glutamate uptake
assay. Fig. 2C shows that glutamate uptake was significantly increased
in GRK2-deficient astrocytes as compared to WT astrocytes.
GRK2 deficiency increases GFAP expression
GFAP is involved in retaining GLAST in the plasma-membrane,
thereby regulating glutamate uptake (Sullivan et al., 2007). We measured
GFAP levels in the brains of GFAP-WT and GFAP-GRK2+/−mice
and WT and GRK2+/− mice by immunohistochemistry and Western
Blot analysis and observed an increase in GFAP in GRK2-deficient animals
as compared to WT littermates (Figs. 3A to C). To investigate
whether increased GFAP levels in brains of GRK2+/−mice were associated
with increased GFAP expression in astrocytes or with a higher
amount of GFAP-positive cells in the GRK2+/− brain, we quantified
GFAP levels in isolated GFAP-GRK2+/− astrocytes. GFAP levels in primary
cultures of GFAP-GRK2+/−astrocytes were increased compared
to astrocytes of GFAP-WT littermates (Fig. 3D). Similarly, increased
GFAP levels were observed in primary cultures of astrocytes from
GRK2+/− mice, indicating that the increase in GFAP expression was
independent of Cre transgene expression and was also not due to potential
differences in the genetic background of the animals (Fig. 3E).
These findings strongly indicate that increased GFAP levels in the
brain of GFAP-GRK2+/− mice are due to a higher GFAP expression in
GRK2-deficient astrocytes.
GRK2 deficiency increases plasma-membrane GLAST expression via an
ezrin-dependent mechanism
GFAP is thought to promote GLAST association with the plasmamembrane
by forming a complex with ezrin and NHERF1 (Sullivan
et al., 2007) and GRK2 is known to phosphorylate ezrin (Cant and
Pitcher, 2005). Levels of phosphorylated ezrin (P-ERM) were strongly
increased when WT astrocytes were stimulated with the group I mGluR-
agonist DHPG (Fig. 4A). DHPG stimulation also rapidly and significantly
increased plasma-membrane levels of GLAST in WT astrocytes (Fig. 4B).
Fig. 4B shows that the increase in GLAST expression in the astrocyte
plasma-membrane was much more pronounced in GRK2-deficient astrocytes
after DHPG stimulation compared to WT. In line with the fact
that ezrin is a GRK2 substrate, the level of phosphorylated ezrin was significantly decreased in GRK2-deficient compared to WT astrocytes upon
DHPG stimulation (Fig. 4A).
Co-immunoprecipitation studies in primary astrocytes show that
GRK2 is found in the same complex as ezrin, GFAP and NHERF1
(Fig. 4C). Phosphorylated ezrin (P-ERM) was detected within the
GRK2 containing protein complex only after exposure to DHPG in
cultured astrocytes (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the interaction of GRK2 with
ezrin, GFAP and NHERF1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
208 C.H. Nijboer et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 54 (2013) 206–215
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.277895645)
in brain samples obtained at 0.5 h post-HI in vivo (Fig. 4D). In
sham-operated mouse brains, ezrin, GFAP and NHERF1 were
not detectable in the complex with GRK2 (data not shown), indicating
that HI promotes the formation of this complex in vivo.
To test the hypothesis that ezrin is involved in GRK2-dependent regulation
of plasma-membrane levels of GLAST, we used siRNA to silence
ezrininWTandGRK2-de ficient astrocytes. Using this approach ezrin
protein was reduced by >90% (Fig. 5A). Scrambled siRNA did not decrease
ezrin protein level (Fig. 5A). As anticipated, silencing ezrin did
not affect GFAP or GRK2 levels (Fig. 5A). Under basal (unstimulated)
conditions silencing of ezrin did not affect GLAST levels in the plasmamembrane
in GRK2-deficient astrocytes compared to WT astrocytes
(Fig. 5B). However, silencing of ezrin completely abolished the increased
DHPG-induced expression of plasma-membrane GLAST in GRK2-

plasma-membrane GLAST in WT astrocytes was not affected after silencing
of ezrin. These data indicate that ezrin is required for increased
GLAST plasma-membrane localizationafter agonist stimulation in conditions
of low GRK2.
Discussion
Astrocytes are believed to act as endogenous protectors against
excitotoxicity as they constitutively express high-affinity glutamate
transporters which can clear excess glutamate and thereby prevent

brain damage (Danbolt, 2001; Rossi et al., 2007). One importantfinding
in our study is that GRK2-deficient astrocytes display higher plasmamembrane
levels of GLAST than WT astrocytes. In addition, glutamate
uptake is increased in GRK2-deficient astrocytes compared to WT astrocytes
, indicating that increased GLAST in GRK2-deficient astrocytes has
functional consequences for glutamate homeostasis. Moreover, the
DHPG-induced increase in plasma-membrane GLAST was significantly
higher in GRK2-deficient astrocytes compared to WT cells. The relevance
of these in vitro data for the in vivo situation is attested by our findings
showing that low astrocyte GRK2 reduces neonatal HI brain damage.
Our data show a novel role of GRK2 in astrocytes and add to the growing
knowledge how astrocytes can defend the brain against injury. We show
that a 60% reduction in the protein level of one kinase, GRK2, can have
crucial effects on the endogenous neuroprotective capacity of astrocytes.
Previously we described the effect of reduced GRK2 in all cells on
ischemic cerebral damage. Mice with a 40–50% reduction in GRK2
protein (GRK2+/− mice) were more sensitive to neonatal ischemic
brain injury (Nijboer et al., 2008). Using Cre-Lox technology, we demonstrated
that low GRK2 in CamKIIα-positive (forebrain) neurons increased
the extent of ischemic brain damage, whereas low GRK2 in
microglia accelerated the onset of cerebral damage without changing
the total amount of damage (Nijboer et al., 2010).
In the present study, we used GFAP-GRK2+/−mice to study the role
of GRK2 in astrocytes. In contrast to the exacerbated HI brain damage
that develops in mice with cell-specific reduction of GRK2 in forebrain
neurons (CamKIIα-GRK2+/− mice) (Nijboer et al., 2010), we show
here that reduction of GRK2 in astrocytes reduces cerebral infarct size
after HI. These data point out that GRK2 has a cell-specificeffecton
HI-induced brain damage. Previously we showed that HI reduces cerebral
GRK2 levels in vivo(Lombardi et al., 2004). Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that exposure to neonatal HI reduced neuronal
GRK2 levels in cortex and hippocampus (Nijboer et al., 2008). Here
we show that HI also reduces GRK2 levels in astrocytes in the brain
in vivo.
During postnatal brain development, GFAP has also been described to
be transiently expressed by neural progenitor cells (Fox et al., 2004;
Imura et al., 2003), therefore we cannot completely rule out that a reduction
in neuronal GRK2 contributes to the phenotype in GFAP-GRK2+/−
animals. However, we described earlier that a reduced GRK2 level in
neurons in fact exacerbates HI brain damage, which makes it unlikely
that a potential reduction in neuronal GRK2 explains the reduced brain
damage in our GFAP-GRK2+/−mice.
In several studies using murine primary astrocytes, it has been
shown that upon a riseinextracellular glutamate, astrocytescan acutely
(within seconds to minutes) upregulate glutamate transporters in the
plasma-membrane (Duan et al., 1999; Munir et al., 2000; Vermeiren
et al., 2005). We show here that GRK2-deficient astrocytes display a
higher level of plasma-membrane GLAST than WT cells under both
basal as well as stimulated conditions. We propose that this increase in
plasma-membrane GLAST that may occur both at synaptic as well as
extrasynaptic sites, is responsible for the increased glutamate uptake by
GRK2-deficient astrocytes in vitro and the observed neuroprotection in
vivo. We could not detect GLT-1 in our primary astrocyte cultures, but
GLT-1 was expressed at low levels in the P9 mouse brain. Therefore we
cannot exclude that a potential effectof GRK2 on GLT-1 subcellular distribution
or activity contributes to the observed protective effect of astrocyte
GRK2-deficiency in neonatal HI brain injury in vivo.

Fig. 6summarizesthepossibleroutesviawhich reduction in astrocytic
GRK2 can lead to enhanced GLAST plasma-membrane association. First,
GRK2 is known to regulate termination of group I-mGluR signaling in response
to agonist-binding by phosphorylation of these receptors (Fig. 6;
point 1) (Dale et al., 2000; Sorensen and Conn, 2003). Interestingly,
group I mGluRs are essential in regulating glutamate transporter levels
in rat astrocytes. Vermeiren et al. (2005) showed that stimulation of
group I-mGluRs with DHPG rapidly increased aspartate uptake in astrocytes
, which could be blocked by a mGluR-antagonist or a specificglutamate
transporter blocker. Additionally,Gegelashvili et al. (2000)showed
that astrocyte mGluRs are crucial in regulating GLAST plasma-membrane
expression. We show here that the mGluR agonist-induced increase in
plasma-membrane GLAST levels is larger in GRK2-deficient astrocytes
as compared to WT astrocytes. Therefore, it is conceivable that impaired
GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization of mGluR is one of
the mechanisms via which low GRK2 enhances GLAST translocation to
the plasma-membrane and subsequent glutamate uptake.
A second mechanism that may contribute to increased plasmamembrane
GLAST levels in GRK2-deficient astrocytes is the increased
GFAP level (Fig. 6; point 2) that we observed in primary cultures of
GRK2-deficient astrocytes as well as in GFAP-GRK2+/− and GRK2+/−
mouse brains. Sullivan et al. (2007) have demonstrated an essential
role for GFAP in regulating plasma-membrane localization of GLAST and
aspartate uptake. Moreover, trafficking of glutamate transporters to the
plasma-membrane is disrupted in GFAP−/− astrocytes (Hughes et al.,
2004). Thus, it is likely that increased GFAP in GRK2-deficient astrocytes

increases GLAST localization ot the plasma-membrane. It remains to be
determined how GRK2 regulates GFAP expression in astrocytes. One possibility
could be that the increased GFAP expression in GRK2-deficient astrocytes
is associated with an increased activation state of these cells
already under baseline conditions.
A third possible mechanism via which reduced GRK2 expression in
astrocytes could influence GLAST localization at the plasma-membrane
is via regulation of cytoskeleton-associated linker proteins such as ezrin
and NHERF1 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1) (Fig. 6; point 3).
The rapid increase in plasma-membrane GLAST expression after glutamate
stimulation requires an intact cytoskeleton ( Duan et al., 1999;
Poitry-Yamate et al., 2002; Shin et al., 2009). In addition, GLAST
upregulation at the plasma-membrane occurs much more rapidly than
the time required for protein synthesis (Munir et al., 2000). Sullivan
et al. (2007)showed that GLAST is present in the same protein complex
as GFAP and the linker proteins NHERF1 and ezrin. When we
immunoprecipitated GRK2 from astrocyte lysates or from the brain
after HI, we observed that GRK2 is also present in complex with
the cytoskeleton-associated proteins ezrin, NHERF1 and GFAP. Interestingly
, it has been shown that GRK2 phosphorylates ezrin (Cant
and Pitcher, 2005) and other cytoskeleton-associated proteins (Kahsai
et al., 2010; Pitcher et al., 1998). GRK2-mediated ezrin phosphorylation
is promoted by GPCR activation as has been shown for the
β2-adrenergic receptor (Cant and Pitcher, 2005). Accordingly, we
show here that stimulation of type I-mGluR by DHPG induces ezrin
phosphorylation and that DHPG-induced ezrin phosphorylation is attenuated
in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. Notably, reduced P-ERM in
GRK2-deficient astrocytes was associated with a stronger increase in
plasma-membrane GLAST in response to DHPG stimulation compared
to WT. Additionally, P-ERM appeared in the protein complex with
GRK2 after DHPG stimulation of primary cultured astrocytes. Furthermore
, in the brainin vivothe interaction of GRK2 and ezrin was promoted
by HI as GRK2 and ezrin were not observed in the same protein
complex in brains of sham-operated control mice. Thesefindings together
indicate that stimulation of mGluRs by either DHPG in vitro or HI
in vivopromoted the interaction between GRK2 and ezrin and possibly
the subsequent phosphorylation of ezrin. We therefore propose
that the increased DHPG-induced plasma-membrane association of
GLAST in GRK2-deficient astrocytes is at least partially dependent on
an interaction between ezrin and GRK2. Supporting this hypothesis,
when ezrin protein expression was reduced by means of siRNA, the
increased DHPG-induced plasma-membrane GLAST association in
Fig. 5. Increased DHPG-induced GLAST association with the plasma-membrane in
GRK2-deficient cells is dependent on ezrin. A: Ezrin protein expression was silenced
in WT and GRK2+/− astrocytes using siRNA. 48 h later, astrocytes were stimulated
with culture medium (basal) or DHPG (50 μM for 10 min) and protein lysates were analyzed
by Western Blotting.β-actin is used as a loading control. Ezrin protein level was
reduced >90% after transfection with siRNA. Transfection with scrambled (SCR) siRNA
did not have any effect on ezrin protein levels. B: Quantification of GLAST expression in
plasma-membrane fractions of WT and GRK2+/− astrocytes after siRNA transfection

Fig. 6. Diagram showing possible regulatory mechanisms of GRK2 on GLAST plasma-membrane localization. Left part of diagram: upon binding of glutamate or a mGluR agonist,
mGluRs are activated and start signaling. As a consequence, GLAST is redistributed from cytoplasmic pools to the plasma-membrane, where the GLAST transporters take up glutamate.
Our results show that GRK2-deficient astrocytes express higher levels of plasma-membrane GLAST under basal and stimulated (mGluR-agonist DHPG) conditions. Several
mechanisms for a regulatory role of GRK2 can be proposed: 1: GRK2 phosphorylates group I mGluRs, leading to termination of signaling downstream of these receptors and receptor
internalization (inhibitory arrow). GRK2-deficiency leads to enhanced signaling via the mGluR and might directly regulate GLAST distribution. 2: A crucial role for GFAP intermediate filaments has been shown for retainment of GLAST in the plasma-membrane (Sullivan et al., 2007). GRK2-deficient astrocytes show enhanced GFAP expression, which
might lead to enhanced linking of GLAST in the plasma-membrane. 3: GFAP regulates GLAST plasma-membrane localization via linker proteins ezrin and NHERF1. Ezrin is a substrate
of GRK2. Stimulation of the mGluR induces phosphorylation of ezrin. GRK2-deficient astrocytes show reduced phospho-ezrin levels. Silencing of ezrin completely abolished
the increase GLAST plasma-membrane expression in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. Our data show that DHPG-induced regulation of GLAST transport to the plasma-membrane becomes
dependent on ezrin only when GRK2 is low.

GRK2-deficient astrocytes was completely abolished. Notably, silencing
of ezrin did not affect the increased plasma-membrane GLAST association
under basal conditions in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. Moreover, in WT
astrocytes silencing of ezrin did not influence DHPG-induced GLAST expression
in the plasma-membrane. These results together indicate that
ezrin phosphorylation is not directly responsible for GLAST upregulation
in WT cells after DHPG stimulation (or under basal conditions in GRK2-
deficient astrocytes), but show that DHPG-induced regulation of GLAST
transport to the plasma-membrane becomes dependent on ezrin only
when GRK2 is low. One possibility is that ezrin can only affect plasmamembrane
GLAST localization when GFAP levels are high, which might
be a limiting step in WT astrocytes.
To conclude, reduced levels of GRK2 in astrocytes may well promote
the translocation of GLAST to the plasma-membraneviaenhanced signaling
of the mGluR due to impaired receptor phosphorylation in combination
with increased formation of the GFAP-ezrin-NHERF1 complex
of proteins which are responsible for GLAST anchoring in the plasmamembrane.
In the current study we describe mechanisms by which GRK2 levels
in astrocytes regulate the trafficking of theglutamate transporter GLAST
and thereby glutamate uptake in vitro. We propose that these mechanisms
contribute to the observed reduction in HI brain damage in
GFAP-GRK2+/−in vivo. Itmay well bepossible,however, thatadditional
astrocyte-dependent mechanisms, including potential effects on cerebral
bloodflow or scar formation might contribute to the observed effects
on HI brain damage in vivo. However, we have shown in a 
previous study that the HI-induced reduction in cerebral blood flow
was not different between WT and GRK2+/− animals that have low
GRK2 in all cells including astrocytes (Nijboer et al., 2008).
More and more research in the field of brain injury indicates an important
role for astrocytes in protecting neurons. Here, we highlight
this endogenous neuroprotective role of astrocytes in the newborn
brain and demonstrate for thefirst time that a downregulation of GRK2
is key in the protective capacity of astrocytes. Our data elucidate that reduction
of only one kinase has crucial effects on the capacity of astrocytes
to regulate association of GLAST with the astrocytic plasma-membrane, a
critical step in regulation of glutamate homeostasis by astrocytes.
