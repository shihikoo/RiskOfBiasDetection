Silent strokes occur more frequently than classic strokes; however, symptoms may go unreported in spite of
lasting tissue damage. A silent stroke may indicate elevated susceptibility to recurrent stroke, which may
eventually result in apparent and lasting impairments. Here we investigated if multiple silent strokes to
the motor system challenge the compensatory capacity of the brain to cumulatively result in permanent
functional deficits. Adult male rats with focal ischemia received single focal ischemic mini-lesions in the
sensorimotor cortex (SMC) or the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), or multiple lesions affecting both SMC and
DLS. The time course and outcome of motor compensation and recovery were determined by quantitative
and qualitative assessment of skilled reaching and skilled walking. Rats with SMC or DLS lesion alone did
not show behavioral deficits in either task. However, the combination of focal ischemic lesions in SMC and
DLS perturbed skilled reaching accuracy and disrupted forelimb placement in the ladder rung walking task.
These observations suggest that multiple focal infarcts, each resembling a silent stroke, gradually compromise
the plastic capacity of the motor system to cause permanent motor deficits. Moreover, thesefindings support
the notion that cortical and subcortical motor systems cooperate when adopting beneficial compensatory
movement strategies.

Introduction
About 12–15% of major strokes are preceded by a transient ischemic
attack or minor stroke (Hankey, 2003). Minor strokes represent small
brain infarctions followed by rapid clinical recovery. In the case of a
“silent stroke” neurological symptoms may not be noticeable and go
unreported in spite of lasting tissue damage (Herderschee et al., 1992;
Kang et al., 2006). Silent or subclinical strokes in humans are associated
withsmall singleormultiple lesions in thenon-eloquent(either cortical
or subcortical) areas of the brain (Masuda et al., 2001). Notably, silent
strokes occur 15 times more often than classic strokes (Brown et al.,
2005; Das et al., 2008). A silent stroke indicates a high risk for recurrent
stroke, which then may become a major event with severe and lasting
impairments (Bernick et al., 2001; de Lau et al., 2009; Kobayashi et al.,
1997; Olsson, 1990; Yatsu and Shaltoni, 2004). Cumulatively, silent
strokes may also accelerate age-associated neurological decline and
contribute to dementia in the elderly (Davalos and Castillo, 1999;
Nascimbeni et al., 2006; Prabhakaran et al., 2008). Once a silent stroke
has been diagnosed, however, treatments are available to prevent
recurrent stroke (Hakim, 1994). This emphasizes the pressing need to
identify predictors for silent and recurrent stroke (Gállego et al., 2009).
Silent strokes frequently involve cortical and subcortical motor
systems (Vermeer et al., 2003). Both sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and
striatum are widely implicated in skilled limb function, as shown in
rats when reaching for food or walking across challenging territory
(Bures and Bracha, 1990; Döbrössy and Dunnett, 2003; Faraji and
Metz, 2007; Klein et al., 2011; Teskey et al., 2003; Metz and Whishaw,
2002; Whishaw et al., 1986;). In particular, skilled reaching movements
in rats are mainly affected by lesions to the motor cortex (Moon et al.,
2009) or its main efferent pathway, the corticospinal tract (Thallmair
et al., 1998; Whishaw et al., 1993). Extrapyramidal components, such
as the striatum may play a central role in recovery and compensation
of skilled motor functions. For example, it has been suggested that the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is crucially involved in the control and
learning of sensorimotor tasks (Alloway et al., 2006; Dunnett and
Iversen, 1982; Reading et al., 1991). Depending on the lesion size and
location, the resultingdeficits can be largely attenuated by compensatory
adjustments (Alaverdashvili and Whishaw, 2008; Metz et al., 2005).
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the plastic
capacity of the motor system to effectively compensate for functional
loss caused by single versus multiple focal ischemic lesions. We
hypothesized that repeated focal infarcts resembling silent strokes in
the cortical or subcortical brain regions challenge the compensatory
capacity of the motor system to cumulatively result in permanent
motor deficits. Using a new rat model of recurrent silent stroke, we
show that compensation for a single focal cortico-striatal infarct may

exhaust the compensatory capacity of the motor system to reveal
cumulative motor deficits.
Material and methods
Subjects
Twenty-nine adult male Long-Evans rats, weighing 330–375 g at
the beginning of the experiment, were used. To enhance motivation
in the reaching task, animals received a restricted diet to maintain
90% of their free feeding body weight. All procedures were approved
by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Lethbridge in
compliance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Experimental design
Rats were trained in skilled forelimb reaching (19 days) and ladder
rung walking tasks (1 day). Reaching and walking performances were
video recorded on the day prior to lesion (baseline) for qualitative
movement analysis. The animals were then matched for their reaching
success rates and randomly assigned to the following groups: sham
(n=7), sensorimotor cortex (SMC) lesion-only (n=8), dorsolateral
striatum (DLS) lesion-only (n=7) and combined (SMC+DLS) lesion
(n=7). Animals assigned to the lesion groups received endothelin-1
(ET-1) injections into the SMC, DLS or SMC+DLS on the side contralateral
to the paw preferred for reaching. Animals were allowed to
rest for 3–4 days. All groups were tested daily in skilled forelimb
reaching and weekly in ladder rung walking for post-lesion behavioral
assessment up to 14 days post-ischemia. Performance in both tasks
was also video recorded on post-lesion days 4 (acute time) and 14
(chronic time). It should be pointed out that the 14-day chronic time
point in the present study was selected based on previous reports in
rodent models (Hilger et al., 2004; Karl et al., 2010; Soltanian-Zadeh
et al., 2003). After behavioral assessments the animals were euthanized
for histological analysis.
Skilled forelimb reaching task
Assessments of skilled forelimb reaching were based on earlier
descriptions (Metz and Whishaw, 2000; Whishaw et al., 1986). Each
training and test session required the rats to reach for 20 food pellets.
Baseline training was considered complete once success rates reached
asymptotic levels. On the last day of each testing period, reaching
performance was video recorded from a frontal view using a digital
camcorder (Canon ZR70 MC) at 25 frames/s with a shutter speed of 1/
500. The tapes were analyzed frame-by-frame on a Sony DV player.
Quantitative analysis included success percent and number of reaching
attempts.
A successful reach was defined as obtaining the pellet on the first
attempt, withdrawing the paw with the pellet through the slit and
releasing the pellet into the mouth. Percent reaching success was
calculated by counting the number of successful reaches divided by
the number of pellets (20) given in each session multiplied by 100.
Moreover, an attempt was defined as a repeated forelimb movement
towards the pellet and obtaining the pellet after more than one reach
(Metz and Whishaw, 2000).
Qualitative movement analysis of limb movements was performed
for the first three successful reaches for each limb. Eleven reaching
movement components [(1) Orient, (2) Limb lift, (3) Digits close,
(4) Aim, (5) Advance, (6) Digits open, (7) Pronation, (8) Grasp, (9)
Supination 1, (10) Supination 2, and (11) Release] and 35 subcomponents
were scored according to earlier descriptions (Metz and
Whishaw, 2000). Each movement component was rated on a threepoint
scale: 0 point, movement absent; 0.5 point, the movement
was present but abnormal; 1 point, the movement was normal.
Ladder rung walking task
Animals were trained to cross a 1‐m long horizontal ladder rung
walking task with irregularly spaced round metal rungs (Metz et al.,
2000; Metz and Whishaw, 2002, 2009). The rungs were arranged at
random distances ranging from 0.5 to 5 cm. The pattern was
maintained for all training and test sessions. Animals were trained
in five trials to cross the ladder. Each test session consisted of three
trials per animal, during which the animals' performance was video
recorded from a lateral perspective for further movement analysis.
A 7-category rating system according to Metz and Whishaw (2002)
was used to determine the type of foot placement on the rung. A
foot fault score of 0 was given for a total miss, a score of 1 for a
deep slip, and a score of 2 for a slight slip. A score of 3 indicated a
replacement of the limb on the rung, a score of 4 a correction of
limb position, a score of 5 a partial placement of the distal limb on
the rung, and a score of 6 indicated a correct limb placement with
full weight support. Scores for both ipsilateral and both contralateral
limbs were averaged.
The number of errors in each crossing was also counted. Based on
the 7-category rating system (Metz and Whishaw, 2002), an error
was defined as a limb placement that received a score of 0, 1 or 2
points. Thus, an error represents any kind of foot slip or total miss.
The number of errors and the number of steps were recorded for
each limb separately. In the present study, the mean number of errors
per step was calculated and averaged for three trials.
Both measures of skilled walking performance (foot fault score
and number of errors) were previously shown to represent valid indicators
of skilled motor impairments (Metz and Whishaw, 2002).
Cortical and subcortical focal ischemia induced by endothelin-1
Procedures for inducing focal ischemia were similar to those
reported by Faraji et al. (2009), except the coordinates, injection
volume and rate. Briefly, the lesion groups received unilateral ET-1
infusion into different points of cortical (SMC) and subcortical (DLS) regions.
Injections of ET-1 were made into the SMC (AP: +0.70, +2, +2,
+2, +3;ML: ±3, ±3, ±3.5, ±2.40, ±3.5; DV:−1.5,−1.5,−2,−2,
−3; 175 pmol; 0.15 μl; 0.1μl/min), DLS (AP: +0.70, +0.70, +0.70,
−0.40,−0.40,−0.40; ML: ±2, ±3, ±4, ±2, ±3, ±4; DV:all−4.60;
175 pmol; 0.18μl; 0.1 μl/min), and SMC+DLS (combined coordinates;
175 pmol; 0.33μl; 0.1μl/min) on the side contralateral to the paw
preferred for reaching. Sham-operated animals received all surgical
procedures except skull trephination to prevent potential behavioral
and neurochemical asymmetries (Adams et al., 1994).
Histological confirmation of lesion extent and location
After behavioral testing was completed, animals were sacrificed by
an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (300 mg/kg i.p.) and perfused
transcardially with 0.9% phosphate buffered saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed, post-fixed for 24 h
in 4% PFA, and stored in 30% sucrose–formalin solution for cryoprotection
until they were sectioned on a cryostat microtome at a
thickness of 40 μm. Every fourth section was mounted on glass slides
and stained with cresyl violet. The stained sections were examined
under a microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and images were captured
using an AxioCam camera (Zeiss, Germany) to quantify lesion extent
(Faraji et al., 2009). The extent of cortical and subcortical damage in
each lesion rat was calculated. Four to five images were captured
under 1× magnification, corresponding approximately to 3.20, 1.70,
1.00, and 0.20 mm (SMC lesion-only) and 1.00, 0.48,−0.26,−0.40,
and −0.90 (DLS lesion-only) relative to bregma. A systematic
sampling grid with an area per point of 2000 pixels^2 was randomly
projected on each image and the number of points hitting intact cortical
and subcortical tissues was counted. Grids were generated using ImageJ

software (V 1.45g; National Institute of Health, USA). The total number
of hits in each rat was then divided by the average number of hits in
each region obtained by four control rats. The complement proportion
was used as the percentage ET-1-induced lesion estimate.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows 11.5.0
(Standard Version, SPSS Inc., USA, 1982–2002). The results were subject
to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures across
testing sessions. Percent success, reaching attempts and detailed
movement scores in skilled reaching task, and the number of errors
per step and foot fault score in the ladder rung walking task were
analyzed as dependent variables for post-lesion motor alterations.
Thepost-hoc(Tukey HSD) test was used for motor measures to adjust
for multiple comparisons. The data were also further investigated by
comparing means and variances between groups using independent
and dependent samplet-tests for within-subject comparison. In addition
to the behavioral measures, for all histological data the differences in
between-group and within-group comparisons were assessed with
independent and dependent sample t-tests, with Pb0.05 set as the
significance level. All data are presented as mean±standard error of
the mean.
Results
Lesion extent
One SMC lesion-only rat with cannula tip location outside the SMC
was excluded from the analysis. Schematic coronal reconstructions
and representative photomicrographs of cortical and subcortical
lesions are illustrated in Fig. 1. Cortical lesions mainly affected the
SMC (according to Paxinos and Watson, 1998), particularly primary
motor cortex. The extent of tissue loss in the striatum was typically
restricted to the DLS (terminology adapted from Chang et al., 1999).
In addition, both cortical and subcortical lesions produced a slight
damage in the central arch of the corpus callosum (n=3, SMC
lesion-only group; n=4, SMC+DLS group; n=3, DLS lesion-only
group). Two rats in the SMC+DLS group also showed superficial
damage to the external capsule and dorsocentral striatum but
remained in the final volumetric assessment. No detectable major
tissue damage was observed in secondary motor cortex or ventrolateral
striatum. The size of the cortical lesions measured from coronal sections

ranged from 11.56±3.76% (+3.20 from bregma) to 17.30±3.39%
(+0.20 from bregma) of the intact cortical area. Volumetric assessment
for subcortical lesions in DLS, on the other hand, showed an extent of
19.12±2.56% (+0.100 from bregma) to 18.82±3.10% (−0.92 from
bregma) of the intact striatal area.
Skilled forelimb reaching task
Quantitative analysis (percent success and reaching attempts)
Rats were required to reach and retrieve food pellets with the
forelimb contralateral to the lesion hemisphere (Fig. 2A). No
significant difference between the groups in percent success was
found during pre-stroke sessions [Figs. 2B and C; SHAM: 42.63±
5.30%; SMC: 33.50±5.26%; DLS: 33.81±5.33%; SMC+DLS: 43.05±
5.80%; P>0.05] indicating that all experimental groups were able to
improve their reaching skills as the training proceeded prior to ischemia.
There were also no significant differences in the number of
reaching attempts between the four groups on the last day (day 19)
of pre-lesion trials [SHAM: 54±4.23, SMC: 66±5.73, DLS: 71±
5.44, SMC+DLS: 56±4.89; P>0.05].
Acute effects of focal ischemia on reaching success were evaluated
on days 1–4 after ischemia (Fig. 2C). All groups showed a slight

improvement in their reaching skills between days 1 and 4. A significant
main effect of Group (F(3,25)=9.19, Pb0.05; ANOVA) and Day
(F(3,25)=4.76, Pb0.05; ANOVA), but no interaction between Group
and Day [P>0.05], was observed in terms of success percent in the
post-lesion acute phase. Success percent in the SMC, DLS and SMC+
DLS animals was significantly different from the SHAM group (all
Psb0.05;post-hocTukey HSD).Post-hoctesting, however, did not reveal
any significant difference between stroke groups on days 1–4 after 
ischemic stroke (all Ps>0.05). An additional comparison between
reaching success percent on pre-lesion day 19 and post-lesion day 4,
by contrast, showed that only rats in SMC+DLS group could not
improve their reaching on day 4 after ischemia [SHAM: 53.33% vs.
51.66%; SMC: 38.33% vs. 34.16%; DLS: 42.55% vs. 27.66%; SMC+DLS:
50.02% vs. 19.12%;t=3.48;Pb0.05, dependentsamplest-test]. The profile of reaching attempts on post-lesion day 1–4indicatedasignificant
main effect of Group (F(3,24)=11.28, Pb0.05; ANOVA) but no effect
of Day or Group by Day (all Ps>0.05). There was no significant difference
between lesion groups in terms of reaching attempts on postlesion
days 1–4(allP>0.05;post-hoc).
Post-lesion motor changes occurred in both reaching success
percent and reaching attempts on days 5–14 (Fig. 2C). A main effect
of Group (F(3,24)=10.39, Pb0.05; ANOVA) was observed in success
percent in which only SHAM animals, compared to other groups, significantly improved in their reaching skills as the testing proceeded
(all Ps>0.05; post-hoc). No difference was observed between lesion
groups in terms of success percent (all Ps>0.05; post-hoc). This indicated
that success percent in the chronic post-lesion phase was not
affected by mere SMC or DLS and even by combined SMC and DLS
focal ischemia. An additional analysis by dependent samples t-test
conducted for success percent and reaching attempts on the last day
of pre-lesion and post-lesion trials (day 19 vs. day 14), however,
revealed that only the SMC+DLS group was significantly affected
by ischemia (success percent: 50.02±6.16% vs. 26.67±4.03%; t=
11.03; Reaching attempts: 56±4.89 vs. 69. 77±5.16; t=8.29; both
Pb0.05).
Qualitative analysis (movement components)
Individual movement scores including eleven movement components
served as qualitative measures of skilled forelimb reaching capacity
(Fig. 2D). No significant difference was observed between groups at the
pre-lesion time point (P>0.05). However, analysis of performance
during post-lesion days 1–4 indicated a significant main effect of Group
(F(3,23)=5.16, Pb0.05; ANOVA) and Components (F(10,23)=3.45,
Pb0.05; ANOVA) in which only the SMC+DLS group had an overall
significantly lower 35-point qualitative score when compared to SMC,
DLS and SHAM groups (all Psb0.05, post-hoc). There was no difference
between SHAM, SMC and DLS groups, and also between SMC and DLS
(all Psb0.05, post-hoc). Furthermore, no interaction of Group and
Components was found (P>0.05) in the post-lesion acute phase. Rats
in the SMC+DLS group had also significantly lower Advance, Supination
I, Supination II and Release scores at the post-lesion acute phase when
compared to other experimental groups (all Psb0.05). These findings
indicate that, unlike other lesion groups, SMC+DLS rats showed
severely altered body positioning when approaching the slit and they
did not display head and upper body weight shifts towards the slit
prior to and during reaching movements. Furthermore, these animals
used disintegrated movements of digits and paws to withdraw the
pellet through the slit (Supinations I and II) as well as more extensive
head and body movements to extract the pellet from the paw (Release).
Moreover, evaluation of movement components in the post-lesion
chronic phase (days 5–14) revealed similar motor deficits in the SMC+
DLS group. The difference between groups in terms of movement components
on post-lesion day 14 was significant (F(3,24)=6.08, Pb0.05;
ANOVA). No significant effect of Component or Group by Component
interaction was observed (all Ps>0.05). In addition, the SMC+DLS
group still showed significantly reduced movement scores when
compared to DLS, SMC and SHAM groups (all Psb0.05; post-hoc). This
effect may have originated from the lower scores in three reaching
sub-components (Supinations I and II, and Release) observed only in
the SMC+DLS animals.
Ladder rung walking task
Number of errors
Each rat was required to cross the ladder rung walking task (Fig. 3A)
at each experimental interval (pre- and post-lesion days 4 and 14). The
number of errors per step was analyzed as an indicator of foot placement
accuracy. While the number of errors in the SMC+DLS group
on post-lesion day 14 was slightly higher than at other time points
(Fig. 3B), no significant difference was observed between groups and
between experimental intervals (all Ps>0.05).
Detailed movement scores
Placement of fore- and hind limbs in the ladder rung walking task
was evaluated with a detailed movement score. An analysis by
ANOVA conducted for between-group effects of cortical and subcortical
lesions on fore-/hind limb use showed no significant difference in the
pre-lesion session (Fig. 3C;P>0.05). However, a significant main effect
of Group (F(3,24)=13.81, Pb0.05; ANOVA) but no effect of Limb, and
Group by Limb (allPs>0.05) was found. Only the SMC+DLS group displayed
significant impairments in forelimb placement on post-lesion
days 4 and 14 when compared to DLS, SMC, and SHAM groups (all
Psb0.05). Forelimb performance in SMC+DLS animals was more
affected than hind limb movements on both post-lesion acute and
chronic time points (Figs. 3D and E). Moreover, there was no significant
difference between limb use on post-lesion days 4 and 14 in the SMC+
DLS group (Fig. 3F; P>0.05).
Discussion
This study assessed the plastic capacity of the motor system to
functionally compensate for deficits caused by single versus multiple
focal ischemic lesions. By varying the infarct location, the contributions
of cortico-striatal systems to fine motor skill were compared.
Using skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks, the major findings
of this study were as follows: (1) single unilateral focal ischemia in
either SMC and DLS did not influence skilled reaching (percent success,
reaching attempts and movement components) and walking performance
(number of errors and movement scores); (2) combined infarct
in SMC and DLS, by contrast, qualitatively impaired subsequent use of
the contralateral limb (advance, supinations I and II, and release) in
skilled reaching along with minor quantitative changes; (3) combined
infarcts also produced impairments in skilled walking (forelimb placement
), whereas single infarcts in SMC and DLS failed to affect skilled
walking behavior. These observations indicate complementary contributions
by SMC and DLS in skilled behaviors and their involvement in
the compensation of motor deficits after stroke.
The present study used a new rat model of silent stroke to investigate
the compensatory capacity of the adult brain. In addition to
the covert face of silent strokes or subclinical strokes (Longstreth et
al., 2002), they are also associated with higher subsequent occurrence
of clinical strokes and other vascular complications (Bernick et al.,
2001; Kobayashi et al., 1997; Yatsu and Shaltoni, 2004). Thus, the
new rat model addresses a timely and important clinical issue by investigating
the effects of single versus multiple focal mini-infarcts to
the cortical and subcortical motor systems.
The present data confirm previous observations that qualitative
movement analysis allows the dissociation of genuine recovery from
compensatory behavioral adaptations (Metz et al., 2005). While qualitative
measures reflect cumulative lesion-induced impairments in
the silent stroke model, quantitative movement performance seems
more resistant to reveal the functional loss. Hence, the qualitative

changes reveal that compensation represents a major process by
which the brain overcomes primary motor deficits, both in terms of
behavioral and structural plasticity (Metz et al., 2005; Moon et al.,
2009; Thallmair et al., 1998;). The compensatory adjustments after
cortical and striatal infarcts included upper body weight shifts to
the good side, axial body rotation, passive limb support and proximal
limb movements to overcome the loss of distal motor control when
reaching for small food pellets (Metz et al., 2005; Whishaw, 2000).
It is important to note that the majority of clinical recurrent minor
strokes affect structures that produce movement, such as cortex and
basal ganglia (Herderschee et al., 1992). The present procedures
allow comparison of the neurological deficits after either cortical or
striatal infarct. Major damage to the SMC or its main efferent pathway,
the corticospinal tract, impairs forelimb use in skilled reaching and
food handling (Döbrössy and Dunnett, 2003; Gharbawie et al., 2007
Thallmair et al., 1998; Whishaw and Metz, 2002; Whishaw, 2000)
and improvement subsequent to SMC lesion was noted to be mainly
due to the use of compensatory movements (Alaverdashvili and
Whishaw, 2010; Metz et al., 2005; Whishaw, 2000). By contrast,
damage to the basal ganglia can cause significant deficits in skilled
reaching behavior (Ballermann et al., 2001; Faraji and Metz, 2007;
Whishaw et al., 1986). Lesions in the lateral portions of the striatum
in particular induce larger impairments in movement initiation and
the amplitude of reaches, and modulate the synergism among muscle
groups involved in reaching movements (Pisa, 1988) compared to 
SMC lesions.
Rats with combined infarcts displayed enduring deficits only in
forelimb use in skilled walking and failed to recover by 14 days after
lesion, confirming the importance of simultaneous contribution of
SMC and DLS in such behaviors. Interestingly, both right and left
forelimbs showed similar profiles of impairment induced by combined
infarcts. Therefore, in line with previous notions (Faraji and Metz, 2007;
Krakauer, 2006; Whishaw, 2000), the present observations suggest simultaneous
cooperation of pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems in
motor performance as well as in post-lesion compensation of lesion
and intact hemispheres.
Improved skilled reaching success throughout the post-lesion
chronic and acute time points revealed that single-infarct groups
developed compensatory strategies more proficiently than animals
with combined infarcts. One may argue that the silent motor deficits
after single small infarcts are attributed to the compensatory capacity
of intact associated motor circuits, such as the intact striatum or
cortex, respectively, to mediate postural and proximal adjustments.

connections allow for a rapid development of compensatory behaviors
within thefirst week after lesion (Metz et al., 2005). Thus, the present
findings confirm that the temporal evolution of plastic changes during
stroke recovery (Roiha et al., 2011) and reorganization of cerebral
networks after stroke (see Grefkes and Fink, 2011for review) contribute
to motor recovery after both cortical and subcortical isolated small
strokes.
The favorable consequences of single infarcts are opposed to
multiple lesions, which may compromise the integrity of the cortical
and striatal circuits at the same time. Such multiple lesions may
leave only the opportunity to recruit more remote or contralateral
motor systems to participate in skilled movements. Multiple silent infarcts
in cortical and subcortical regions may challenge the facilitative
plasticity-related alterations in cerebral networks. Accordingly,
animal studies have shown that an additional cholinergic depletion
(Craig et al., 2009)orstress( Faraji et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2008)
can precipitate the functional loss of an otherwise silent mini-stroke
in cognitive function. Furthermore, combined major, non-silent lesions
in SMC and red nucleus produce more severe behavioral deficits than
either lesion alone (Whishaw et al., 1998). This indicates that skilled
limb use is supported by alternative descending neural pathways that
are modulated by various transmitter and physiological systems. Furthermore
, the DLS is critically involved in the execution and learning
of sensorimotor tasks (Pidoux et al., 2011) that mediate goal-directed
behaviors. Thus, the regulation, correct sequencing and learning of
skilled movements in sensorimotor and skilled movement tasks may
be particularly sensitive to concurrent lesions that prevent taskspecific acquisition of compensatory movement strategies.
Clinical and experimental observations of deteriorating neurological
function (Davalos and Castillo, 1999; Nascimbeni et al., 2006;
Prabhakaran et al., 2008) indicate that multiple minor strokes progressively
compromise the brain's ability to compensate for functional loss.
This observation stands in contrast to notions that a single minor stroke
might induce ischemic tolerance and represent a preconditioning stimulus
(see Gidday, 2006 for review). Preconditioning may upregulate
genes related to neuroprotection (Belayev et al., 1996; Chen and
Simon, 1997) and reduce the damage by a subsequent stroke (Alkayed
et al., 2002; Malhotra et al., 2006). Accordingly, patients with prodromal
minorstrokehavea10–20% more favorable outcome after stroke (Weih
et al., 1999; Moncayo et al., 2000). One explanation for this variation
mightbethat numberand intervalof recurrentischemicevents critically
determine functional outcome. The present study induced multiple
infarcts concurrently, thus preventing possible preconditioning effects
by recurrent infarcts that may favor neuronal survival or compensatory
sprouting of intactfibers.
It is generally expected that multiple lesions compared to single
lesions in the brain are associated with noticeable behavioral deficits
(Craig et al., 2009; Faraji and Metz, 2007; Whishaw et al., 1998). The
ET-1-induced ischemic lesions in this study reproduce four characteristic
features of silent stroke (Masuda et al., 2001; Yatsu and Shaltoni,
2004): (1) both cortical and subcortical single infarcts were asymptomatic
in two motor tasks, (2) they were small and (3) predictably
localized, and finally (4) stroke-induced motor deficits were only
determined with detailed qualitative assessments. Compared to
other animal models of silent stroke (Bailey et al., 2009), ET-1 administration
may represent a reliable preclinical strategy to mimic human
silent stroke. While this model produces discrete motor system
lesions, clinical observations documented mostly cognitive decline
and dementia after silent strokes (Masuda et al., 2001). The study of
motor deficits in experimental studies, however, allows the use of
high-resolution assessment for unambiguous confirmation of compensatory
and restorative neuroplasticity.
In summary, the present findings show that (1) cortico-striatal
pathways cooperate to adopt effective compensatory motor strategies
and that (2) functional compensation after single infarct is sufficient
to overcome the primary deficits, while multiple infarcts exhaust the
neuronal compensatory capacity of the neuronal substrate. These observations
suggest that multiple focal infarcts, each resembling a
silent stroke, challenge the compensatory capacity of the motor system
to cumulatively result in permanent motor deficits.
