Abstract
Background: Growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) is serving as a neuronal activity
sensor. Brain ischemia induces the expression of Gadd45b, which stimulates recovery after stroke and may play a
protective role in cerebral ischemia. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms of how Gadd45b
expression regulated and the down-stream targets in brain ischemia. Here, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation
and reperfusion (OGD/R) model, we identified Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1, a HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase,
involved in the control of Gadd45b protein level. In this study, we also investigated the role of Huwe1-Gadd45b
mediated pathway in BDNF methylation.
Results: We found that the depletion of Huwe1 by lentivirus shRNA mediated interference significantly increased
the expression of Gadd45b and BDNF at 24 h after OGD. Moreover, treatment with Cycloheximide (CHX) inhibited
endogenous expression of Gadd45b, and promoted expression of Gadd45b after co-treated with lentivirus shRNAHuwe1.
Inhibition of Gadd45b by lentivirus shRNA decreased the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) pathway, while inhibition of
Huwe1 increased the expression levels of BDNF and p-CREB. Moreover, shRNA-Huwe1 treatment decreased the
methylation level of the fifth CpG islands (123 bp apart from BDNF IXa), while shRNA-Gadd45b treatment increased
the methylation level of the forth CpG islands (105 bp apart from BDNF IXa).
Conclusions: These findings suggested that Huwe1 involved in the regulation of Gadd45b expression under OGD/
R, providing a novel route for neurons following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. It also indicated that the
methylation of BDNF IXa was affected by Gadd45b as well as Huwe1 in the OGD/R model.

Backgrounds
Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in
the world. The neurological functional disruption caused
by stroke is often severe. Nevertheless, surviving patients
exhibit a certain degree of restoration of function attributable
to the remarkable capacity of the adult brain plasticity
[1, 2]. In order to potentiate post-stroke recovery, several
rehabilitation therapies have been undertaken [3, 4].
Growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible protein 45
beta (Gadd45b), originally known as MyD118, is a member
of the highly homologous Gadd45 family of proteins
including Gadd45a, b, and g [5]. More recently, Gadd45b
was shown as a neuronal activity sensor, essential for adult
neurogenesis by demethylating and activating key neurogenic
genes like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
[6]. This discovery prompted a growing body of literature
documenting their role as players in adult cognitive function
and central nervous system diseases, such as electroconvulsive
seizure [6, 7], and psychotic disorders [8].
Recently, our study has reported that rat brain ischemia

stimulated the expression of Gadd45b in the cortex,
Gadd45b-RNAi significantly decreased the level of BDNF
and inhibited axonal plasticity after MCAO [9]. Our results
showed that Gadd45b stimulated recovery after
stroke, and may play a protective role in cerebral ischemia
[9, 10]. However, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms for how the expression of Gadd45b is regulated
in brain ischemia. Furthermore, the mechanism for
the Gadd45b effect on BDNF under brain ischemia is still
poorly understood.
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) as the major
intracellular machinery for protein degradation, has been
attracted more attention in neurobiology [11]. The accumulation
of ubiquitin-containing protein aggregates following
cerebral ischemia is a general feature [12].
Previous studies have showed that the major control and
selectivity are determined by ubiquitin E3 ligase at the
substrate ubiquitination step [13]. The HECT-domain
E3 ligase Huwe1 (HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing
1) is involved in the ubiquitination, degradation
of multiple proteins, playing diverse biological roles and
the altered expression is detected in multiple diseases
[14–17]. Huwe1 is important for neurogenesis in cerebral
cortex and possibly brain cancer, thus plays critical
roles in nervous system plasticity, regeneration and disease
[14]. Previous studies have indicated that Gadd45 is
ubiquitinated and regulated by proteolysis [18, 19]. Proteasome
inhibitor MG132 increased the expression of
Gadd45b in prostate cancer cells [19].
Based on these studies, given that the expression of
Gadd45b is affected by UPS, we hypothesize that Huwe1
might play an important role in regulating Gadd45b expression
in brain ischemia. And Gadd45b maybe affect
the level of BDNF by demethylation of CpG islands in
brain ischemia. To verify the hypothesis, we used the
oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)
model of rat cortical neuronal cells to mimic cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion condition in vitro. Therefore, we
examined the effects of Huwe1 on Gadd45b and BDNF
signaling during ischemia-reperfusion injury. We also
examined the effects of Gadd45b on BDNF signaling,
and characterized the effects of Huwe1 and Gadd45b on
BDNF methylation as well as down-stream targets.
Results
Expression of Huwe1 and Gadd45b following OGD/R
We subjected primary cortical neurons to 3 h of OGD
followed by reperfusion for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h, and
then measured OGD/R-induced neuronal cell viability reduction
and LDH release. As shown in Fig. 1a, neuronal
cell viability declined progressively as the reperfusion time
prolonged. About only 42.5 % of neuron cells remained viable
at 24 h. Meanwhile, LDH leakage was markedly increased
from OGD 3 to 72 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1b).
To examine the effect of Huwe1 on Gadd45b under
OGD/R, we then analyzed the expression of Huwe1 and
Gadd45b by western blot in both normal neurons and
OGD/R-treated neurons at different time points. As
shown in Fig. 1c, western blot analysis showed that the
expression of Huwe1 increased from OGD 3 to 72 h
after reperfusion compared to controls, and reached a
peak at 48 h after reperfusion. However, the expression
of Gadd45b increased since OGD 3 h and lasted up to
72 h, and reached a peak at 24 h. There was a down
trending of the expression of Gadd45b at 48 h. We assumed
that there may be a correlation between Huwe1
and Gadd45b at 24 h after OGD, so we choose this time
point for further study.
Inhibition of Huwe1 increased the expression of Gadd45b
To further determine whether Huwe1 was involved in the
regulation of Gadd45b after OGD/R, shRNA-Huwe1 or
shRNA-Gadd45b was added to the culture medium on
DIV 3. As shown in Fig. 2b-c, treatment with shRNAHuwe1
significantly decreased the protein and mRNA
levels of Huwe1 at 24 h after OGD, compared to lentivirus-
GFP-scramble control group. Conversely, shRNA-Huwe1
increased the protein level of Gadd45b at 24 h, compared
to lentivirus-GFP-scramble control group (Fig. 2d). The
mRNA level of Gadd45b was not changed at 24 h after
treatment with shRNA-Huwe1 (Fig. 2e). Treatment with
shRNA-Gadd45b reduced the protein and mRNA levels of
Gadd45b at 24 h, compared to lentivirus-scramble control
group (Fig. 2f, g). However, shRNA-Gadd45b did not affect
the expression of Huwe1 at 24 h, compared to lentivirusscramble
control group (Fig. 2h, i). Moreover, we used another
probe sequence for shRNA targeted to the coding sequence
of Huwe1, and found that shRNA-Huwe1-2 also
increased the expression of Gadd45b at 24 h after OGD/R
(Additional file 1: Figure S1). The effect of the shRNAHuwe1-1
or shRNA-Huwe1-2 on basal level of Huwe1 and
Gadd45b was also examined in the normal neuron cells
without OGD/R (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Huwe1 interacts with Gadd45b
Based on these data, we examined the co-expression of
Huwe1 and Gadd45b in cortex neuron cells by fluorescent
dual-labeling method. As shown in Fig. 3a, there was little
co-expression of Huwe1 and Gadd45b in normal cortex
neuron cells. However, at 24 h after reperfusion, the coexpression
of Huwe1 and Gadd45b was obviously increased
(Fig. 3b). The co-expression of Huwe1 and
Gadd45b was mainly around the nucleus (Fig. 3f) by Confocal
Fluorescence Microscopy. Treatment with shRNAHuwe1
increased the optical density of Gadd45b (Fig. 3d),
compared to treatment with lentivirus-GFP-scramble control
group (Fig. 3c). The immunofluorescent staining results

of treatment with shRNA-Huwe1 were similar to the results
of western blot (Fig. 3i, j).
To evaluate whether Huwe1 interacted with Gadd45b,
neurons were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation
assay. The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation verified
this interaction at 24 h after reperfusion, compared to
normal neuron cells (Fig. 4a). We then determined the
effects of Huwe1 on the protein stability of Gadd45b at
defined intervals after treatment with CHX to block de
novo protein synthesis. CHX obviously inhibited the
expression of Gadd45b at 24 h (Fig. 4c). Conversely, cotreatment
with shRNA-Huwe1 with CHX stably increased
the expression of Gadd45b at 24 h (Fig. 4c).
These results demonstrated that Huwe1 may promote
the protein degradation of Gadd45b.
Inhibition of Gadd45b significantly reduced the
expression of BDNF
As shown in Fig. 5a, the expression of BDNF decreased
after OGD, compared to normal neuron cells control.
There was a slowly increased trend from 24 h and significantly
increased at 120 h after reperfusion. Fig 5b
showed that shRNA-Gadd45b significantly reduced the
expression of BDNF at 24 h, compared to lentivirusscramble
control group. ShRNA-Huwe1 increased the
expression of BDNF at 24 h, compared to lentivirus-
GFP-scramble control group. However, shRNA-Gadd45b
co-treatment with shRNA-Huwe1 had no effect on the
expression of BDNF. We next examined the effect of
shRNA-Gadd45b and shRNA-Huwe1 on the mRNA
level of BDNF (Fig. 5c). ShRNA-Gadd45b significantly
reduced the mRNA level of BDNF at 24 h. Conversely
, shRNA-Huwe1 increased the mRNA level of
BDNF at 24 h.
Others had demonstrated that Gadd45b affects the
methylation of BDNF. DNA methylation at cytosine residues
occurs at CpG dinucleotides, and demethylation
typically activates gene expression, which is found in highdensity
areas or so-called islands located within proximal
promoters. Although the expression of BDNF can be initiated
by nine alternative promoters (for exons I to IX),
other authors had shown that only the promoter of exon
IX undergoes rapid DNA demethylation upon neuronal
activity induction. Previous research had demonstrated
that less Gadd45b binding to the BDNF IXabcd promoter,
especially the IXa, reduced the mRNA level of BDNF
in psychotic subjects. So, we next examined the DNA
methylation level of BDNF IXa under OGD/R. To
validate the methylation status of the BDNF IXa, we
designed specific PCR primers for bisulfite sequencing
PCR (BSP). There are six CpG islands (24, 27, 88,
105, 123, 200 bp apart from the IXa starting nucleic

methylation level of the fifth CpG islands (123 bp)
was hyper-methylated (100 %) at 24 h after reperfusion
, compared to normal cortex neuron cells control.
ShRNA-Huwe1 decreased obviously the methylation
level of the fifth CpG (20 %) at 24 h. However,
shRNA-Gadd45b increased the methylation level of
the forth CpG (105 bp, 100 %) at 24 h.

We also examined the expression of Gadd45b and
BDNF in cortex neuron cells by fluorescent dual-labeling
method. Figure 6 showed the double-fluorescence results
of Gadd45b and BDNF, similar to the results of western
blot. Treatment with shRNA-Gadd45b decreased the average
optical value of Gadd45b (11.37 ± 1.74) and BDNF
(3.81 ± 0.48), compared to treatment with lentivirusscramble
control group (Gadd45b: 64.92 ± 17.02, BDNF:
39.29 ± 11.27). Treatment with shRNA-Huwe1 increased
the average optical value of Gadd45b (136.01 ± 26.52) and
BDNF (179.01 ± 34.91), compared to treatment with

and stimulating RhoA signaling [21, 22]. As shown in
Fig. 7a, treatment with shRNA-Gadd45b decreased the
expression of TrkB and increased the expression of
p75NTR at 24 h after reperfusion. However, shRNAHuwe1
increased the expression of TrkB and decreased
the expression of p75NTR at 24 h. ShRNA-Gadd45b decreased
the rate of p-Erk1/2/Erk1/2 and p-CREB/CREB
at 24 h. ShRNA-Huwe1 increased the rate of p-Erk1/2/
Erk1/2 and p-CREB/CREB at 24 h. As shown in Fig. 7b,
shRNA-Gadd45b increased the activity of RhoA,
compared to the lentivirus-scramble control group.
There was no significant difference in the activity of
RhoA between the shRNA-Huwe1 group and the
lentivirus-GFP-scramble control group at 24 h. However,
it exhibited an increase trend toward the activity of
RhoA in the shRNA-Gadd45b group. Based on our results
, we proposed the scheme model for the effect of
Huwe1 on Gadd45b and BDNF signaling under oxygenglucose
deprivation and reperfusion injury of primary rat
cortical neuronal cells. As shown in Fig. 7c, we deduced
that Huwe1 interacts with Gadd45b through ubiquitination
pathway. Huwe1 and Gadd45b could regulate the
expression of BDNF by way of DNA methylation, and
also affect the downstream signal of BDNF.
As shown in Fig. 8, the rate of cell apoptosis in the
normal neuron cells was 10.97 ± 2.83. ShRNA-Gadd45b
increased the rate of cell apoptosis (57.71 ± 7.49), compared
to the lentivirus-control group (41.74 ± 5.54) at
24 h after reperfusion (p< 0.05). ShRNA-Huwe1 decreased
the rate of cell apoptosis (31.40 ± 5.41), compared
to the lentivirus-control group at 24 h (p< 0.05).
Discussion
The major findings of this study are as follows: (1)
Gadd45b and Huwe1 were activated under neuron OGD/
R; (2) Inhibition of Huwe1 significantly enhanced the expression
of Gadd45b under neuron OGD/R; (3) Gadd45b
and Huwe1 affect the expression of BDNF through regulation
of methylation under neuron OGD/R.
Transient cerebral ischemia induces irreversible protein
aggregate formation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has
a central role in the selective degradation of intracellular
proteins, and a particularly important role in the context of
the nervous system. Previous studies showed that the UPS
plays a complex and unambiguous role in the pathophysiology
of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [11]. While
the 26S proteasome activity recovers in many regions after
reperfusion (frontal cortex), in general the proteasome is
irreversibly inhibited [14]. A time-dependent decrease in
proteasome activity has also been detected in ipsilateral
cortex during 1–24 h reperfusion after transient focal ischemia
[14]. Huwe1 (also named ARF-BP1, Mule, Lasu1,
Ureb1, E3 histone, and HectH9), encodes a HECT domain
ubiquitin ligase, and may play critical roles in nervous system
plasticity, regeneration and disease. Zhao et al. conditionally
deleted the Huwe1 gene in the mouse brain and
demonstrated that this enzyme is essential for the transition
from self-renewing and proliferating neural stem progenitor
cells to differentiated neurons [23]. In our study,
we found that the expression of Gadd45b reached a peak
at 24 h, and showed a decreased trend at 48 h. The expression
of Huwe1 was increased from 24 to 48 h after reperfusion.
Gadd45 has been demonstrated that is ubiquitinated
and regulated by proteolysis previously. Although Gadd45b

Gadd45b. A key question is that whether the increased
Gadd45b level is lasting or transient. We found the expression
of Gadd45b increased after 3 h OGD, reached a
peak at 24 h, and decreased to the normal level at 120 h
after reperfusion. Therefore, the high expression of
Gadd45b is transient in our experiment condition. Previous
data suggested a model in which seizure or physiological
activity stimulates neurogenesis in a paracrine
manner via transient actions of Gadd45b on mature neurons
[14, 24]. Short-lived Gadd45b expression leads to
reversible epigenetic modifications involving demethylation
of specific gene regulatory regions, both transient
events resulting in more long-lasting changes in cell proliferation
[24]. Multiple studies have shown that Gadd45b
may be important specifically for the activity-dependent of
the BDNF gene promoter demethylation, leading to subsequent
increases in gene and protein expression and
plasticity-related signaling [25, 26]. Less Gadd45b binding
to the BDNF IXabcd promoter and reduced BDNF mRNA
expression in psychotic subjects [8, 25]. Electroconvulsive

seizures induced the regulatory region IX of the BDNF
promoter which showed significant demethylation [24].
The time course of BDNF demethylation paralleled induction
of Gadd45b after electroconvulsive seizures, both being
transient and reversible. Previous study demonstrated
that rapid de novo DNA methylation takes place after
expression of Gadd45b decreases, within 24 h after
ECT [6, 24]. In our study, the BSP results showed
that shRNA-Huwe1 obviously decreased the methylation
level of the fifth (123 bp apart from BDNF IXa)
CpG islands (20 %) at 24 h. While, shRNA-Gadd45b 
increased another CpG island, which is about 105 bp
apart from BDNF IXa, and hypermethylated (100 %)
at 24 h after reperfusion. We found no significant
change on others of the six CpG islands. Our western
blot also showed that shRNA-Gadd45b decreased the
expression of BDNF, but shRNA-Huwe1 increased the
expression of BDNF at 24 h after reperfusion. Our
study shows that in the pathological process of neuron
OGD/R, methylation maybe one way of Gadd45b influencing
on BDNF. Whether the effect of Gadd45b
on the methylation of BDNF is long lasting or transient
under OGD/R is remaining worthy of study.
BDNF binds with high specificity to the TrkB and to
the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 [4]. Mature
BDNF activates TrkB receptors, and activated MAPK/
ERK, thereby positively impacting brain function [20].
Recently, increasing evidence suggests that collapses
neurites outgrowth by activating RhoA through the
p75NTR signaling pathway. When neuron cells were
treated with shRNA-Gadd45b, the expression of TrkB,
p-Erk1/2 and p-CREB were decreased at 24 h after reperfusion.
ShRNA-Huwe1 increased the expression of
TrkB, p-Erk1/2 and p-CREB at 24 h. This indicated that
Gadd45b and Huwe1 affected the BDNF and BDNF
downstream effectors. Activation of the Erk signaling
Fig. 8 The morphological features of apoptosis were monitored by fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33342. Neuron cells were
infected with lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1 or shRNA-Gadd45b, followed by OGD and reperfusion 24 h. The dye Hoechst 33342 was introduced to
characterize the cells nucleic and emits blue fluorescence at 480 nm. Cells that exhibited reduced nuclear size, chromatin condensation, intense
fluorescence, and nuclear fragmentation were considered to be apoptotic (white arrow). OGD/R induced neuron cells apoptosis at 24 h (b),
compared to normal neuron cells (a). Treatment with shRNA-Gadd45b increased the number of apoptotic cells (c). Treatment with shRNA-Huwe1
decreased the number of apoptotic cells (d). Scale bar = 10 μm

pathway has been reported to regulate neuronal differentiation
[4]. Moreover, previously, we have reported that
Gadd45b-RNAi significantly inhibited axonal plasticity
after rat MCAO, and also significantly decreased the expression
levels of both BDNF and p-CREB pathway and
promoted ROCK expression at 14 days after MCAO [9].
In our study, we also found shRNA-Gadd45b affected
the RhoA. This indicated that transient action of
Gadd45b may lead to the lasting affect after brain ischemia.
Moreover, we found that Huwe1 and Gadd45b affected
apoptosis under OGD/R. On the basis of our
results, we proposed the scheme model for the effect of
Huwe1 on Gadd45b and BDNF signaling. Gadd45b may
be a substrate of Huwe1 under OGD/R. Huwe1 and
Gadd45b affected the expression of BDNF by way of
BDNF IXa methylation, and then affected the expression
of BDNF receptors and downstream molecules, thereby
took apart in the plasticity and repair under OGD/R.
However, the scheme model yet needs further studies
and more verification in all aspects.
Conclusion
This study suggested that a negative association between
Gadd45b and Huwe1. Huwe1 may regulate Gadd45b
protein stability in cerebral OGD/R injury. Gadd45b and
Huwe1 may regulate the expression of BDNF via BDNF
IXa methylation. Further studies are needed to delineate
the precise role of Gadd45b in ischemic recovery and to
investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting their
expression and function.

Primary cortical neurons culture
Primary cerebral cortex neuronal cultures were obtained
from Sprague–Dawley rats embryos at embryonic day 17
as described previously [27, 28]. In brief, the cortical tissues
were dissected, treated with 0.125 % trypsin solution
and 0.05 % DNase I, dissociated by repeated
pipetting, and filtered through a Falcon cell strainer
(70 μm). Dissociated cortex cells were plated at a density
of 1.5 × 106 cells/well on 6-well plates, and cultured in
Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 % B27, 0.25 %
GlutaMax, 100U/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in
a humidified 95 % air and 5 % CO
2
incubator. Wells
were pretreated by incubation with PDL (0.1 mg/ml) at
37 °C for 4 h and then carefully rinsed with phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.2) twice. Experiments were
performed in vitro Days 7–12 (DIV 7–12), after initial
plating of cultures. Neurons were identified by staining
with neuronal marker MAP2 and neuroglia maker GFAP
antibodies. More than 90 % of primary cultured cortical
cells were positive for neuronal marker MAP2, determined
by immunohistochemistry and inverted fluorescence
microscopy. All experimental procedures were in
accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and China Council on Animal Care. Ethical approval
was obtained from the Animal Ethics Committee
of Chongqing Medical University.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by
reperfusion (R)
For an in vitro model of hypoxic/ischemic insult, primary
cortical neurons were subjected to moderate
oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion, performed
following the method as previously described [29]. On
DIV 7, while the culture medium was replaced with a
glucose-free DMEM, cells were maintained in an anaerobic
chamber (0.3 % O
2
; 5 % C0 
2
) for 3 h. After 
3 h of OGD treatment, the cell culture medium was
changed back to normal Neurobasal medium and
returned to normoxic conditions for reperfusion (R)
0, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. In the control condition,
cells were treated identically except that they were
not exposed to OGD/R.

Lentiviral vectors construction and lentiviral infection
Silencing Huwe1 lentiviral vector (pGIPZ system) and silencing
Gadd45b lentiviral vector (plko1 system) were ordered
from Open Biosystem. Third generation pseudotype
lentivirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
shRNA Huwe1 (lentiviral-GFP-Huwe1) and expressing
shRNA Gadd45b (lentiviral-Gadd45b) were generated as
previously described [30, 31]. Probe sequence for shRNA
targeted to the coding sequence of Gadd45b and Huwe1
(Gadd45b: Genebank NC_005106.4,TGAAGAGAGCAG
AGGCAATAA, Huwe1: Genebank NC_005120.4, TCT
AGTAGCCAAATTGGAG) produced with a threeplasmid
system by transient transfection of 293FT cells.
pCMVdr-8.91 and pMD2G were used as package system.
Briefly, for lentivirus production, HEK 293FT cells plated
to 70 % confluency were cotransfected with Lipofectamine® 3000 Transfection Reagent. Medium was collected
at 48 and 72 h after transfection, and filtered at 0.45 μm
pore size and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at
27,000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h. The resulting pellets were resuspended
in 150 μl PBS, pooled and stored at -80 °C.
Efficiency of infection as measured by GFP fluorescence
was >90 % for the lentiviral-GFP-Huwe1. The measurement
of knockdown expression in infected 293FT cells
were performed by real-time quantitative PCR using
SYBR Green detection as described previously for all
lentiviruses.
Knockdown efficiency of lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1 and
lentivirus shRNA-Gadd45b was also assessed on primary
cortical neurons. Primary cell cultures were infected at
the indicated DIV by adding concentrated lentivirus at a
multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5 to the growing
media. In brief, on DIV 3, three in four of the culture
medium was removed from culture wells, and add lentivirus
(100 μl shRNA-Huwe1 or 100 μl shRNAGadd45b
), 500 μl fresh normal culture medium and
5 μg/ml polybrene per well of 6-well plates. The cells
were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and the removed
medium was then returned to the well. Cultures were incubated
for a further 4 days before subjected to OGD/R.
Transduction efficiency was examined by western blot
and quantitative real time PCR for Huwe1 and
Gadd45b levels. Lentiviral-scramble-GFP or lentiviralscramble
was used as a control in each experiment to
compare to treatment with lentiviral-GFP-Huwe1 or
lentiviral-Gadd45b.
Neuron cell treatment with cycloheximide
Protein stability was measured in the presence of Cycloheximide
(CHX). On DIV 3, neuron cells were treated
with lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1 or lentivirus GFP-Scramble
as descried previously. On DIV 7, neuron cells were subjected
to OGD 3 h and reperfusion 24 h, and then treated
with CHX (50 μg/ml per well of 6-well plates) and
harvested at the indicated times (0, 15, 30, 60 min)
followed by western blot for Gadd45b.
Cell viability study and LDH release assay
Cell viability was evaluated by the CCK-8 assay. Cell death
was determined by the LDH into the media, for LDH is
an indicator for cell injury. Thus, CCK-8 and LDH activity
in the medium after OGD/R was determined according to
the protocols of the manufacturer’smanual.
Hoechst 33342 staining
To perform Hoechst 33342 staining, neurons on
24 mm × 24 mm coverslips (4 × 105 cells/well on 12-
wells plate), were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and incubated
for 10 min at room temperature with 5 μg/ml
Hoechst 33342. The neurons with clearly condensed and
segmented chromatin were considered to be apoptotic.
For all the groups, 300 cells (including the normal and
apoptotic cells) were counted in a blind manner using
inverted fluorescent microscopy (Nikon).
Protein Co-immunoprecipitation
The role of Huwe1 on Gadd45b was detected by Co-
Immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay. Co-IP assay was
conducted according to the protocols of the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold
PBS and lysed by ice-cold lysis buffer. Equivalent
amounts of neuronal cell protein lysate were mixed with
1 μg the anti-Huwe1 or anti-Gadd45b or anti-IgG antibodies
at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with magnetic
beads by rotating mixer at room temperature for
10 min. IgG was used as a negative control. The
antibody-bound beads were washed 3 times with PBS/
Tween, and placed on a magnet to remove the supernatant
by gentle pipetting. The immune-complexes were
degenerated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then
subjected to Western blot using the indicated antibodies.
Band intensities were quantified by densitometry using
Image J software.
Confocal fluorescence microscopy
For colocalization experiments, neuron cells on coverslips
were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then
incubated with anti-Huwe1 and anti-Gadd45b antibodies
at 4 °C overnight. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed
following a standard procedure described. After
labeling with the primary antibodies, cells were treated
with Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa
488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies at
room temperature for 2 h, washed with PBS, incubated
with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear
stain, and then mounted with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent.
Images were obtained by a confocal laser scanning
microscopes (Leica Microsystems). Digital images were

recorded and analyzed using FV10-ASW 3.1 Viewer and
Image Pro Plus software.
BDNF DNA methylation analysis
DNA was extracted from neuron cells and analyzed
using BSP bisulfite sequencing (BSP). DNA methylation
analysis was conducted using standard procedures. The
CpG-rich region of the BDNF Exon IXa between 1 and
471 bp (accession number: EF125690.1) includes six
CpG sites. PCR primers for amplification of specific targets
sequences are listed as follows: 5’-ATGTGTGAT
TGTGTTTTTGGTG-3’ (sense), 5’-CCTACAAAAAACA
CAAATCAAT ATC-3’ (anti-sense). For sequence analysis,
the BSP products were purified and subjected to direct
sequencing in Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
The activity of Rho assay
The activity of Rho was evaluated by the G-LISA® RhoA
Activation Assay Biochem Kit™ (Absorbance Based). The
RhoA G-LISA® kit contains a Rho-GTP-binding protein
linked to the wells of a 96 well plate. Active, GTP-bound
Rho in cell lysates will bind to the wells while inactive
GDP-bound Rho is removed during washing steps. The
bound active RhoA is detected with a RhoA specific
antibody. The degree of RhoA activation is determined
by comparing readings from activated cell lysates versus
non-activated cell lysates. Inactivation of RhoA is generally
achieved in tissue culture by a serum starvation step.
Thus, Rho activity in the neuron cells was determined
according to the protocols of the manufacturer’s manual.
Immunofluorescence
For double immunofluorescence, cells on coverslips were
fixed in 4 % PFA, treated with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS
for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated with 3 %
BSA blocking solution for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated
with anti-Gadd45b and anti-BDNF antibodies at 4 °C
overnight, washed with PBS, incubated with fluorogenic
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, and
then incubated with DAPI. Cells were mounted with Pro-
Long® Gold antifade reagent. Images were obtained by an
inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon).
Western blot analysis
Extracted total proteins were incubated with cold RIPA
lysis buffer and separated by 10 % or 15 % SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were
transferred to 0.22 μm (Bio-Rad) or 0.45 μm (Millipore)
PVDF membranes, and reacted with primary antibodies
specific to Huwe1, Gadd45b, BDNF, p75, TrkB, p-CREB,
CREB, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 at 4 °C overnight. The
membranes were washed with TBST, and incubated with
secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
The protein levels were normalized to Tubulin. Bound
antibodies on the membrane were detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore)
according to the manufacturer’s manual. The intensities of
bands on blots were analyzed by the Image J software.
Quantitative real time PCR analysis
SYBR green-based quantitative real time PCR (qPCR)
was used to examine the mRNA levels of Huwe1,
Gadd45b and BDNF in RNAs prepared from cells. Total
RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed on
an ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Life technologies
). The GADPH gene was used as an endogenous control.
The amount of gene expression was then calculated
as the difference cycle threshold (ΔCT) between the CT
value of the target gene and the GAPDH.ΔΔCT were difference
between ΔCT values of test sample and the control.
Relative expression of target genes was calculated as
2−ΔΔCT. Real time RT-PCR primers as follows:
Huwe1: forward: 5’-CAAGTAGCCATCAGCAAGA-3’
reverse: 5’-GTCCTCCAGTTCATTCTCAA-3’
Gadd45b: forward: 5’-GTCACCTCCGTCTTCTTG-3’
reverse: 5’-GATTCAGTCACACTTCACAG-3’
BDNF: forward: 5’- CTTAGGCAGAATGAGCAATG-3’
reverse: 5’-AATGGACAGAACTATCAGGAG-3’
GADPH: forward: 5’-GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3’
reverse: 5’-GTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3’
Statistical analysis of data
Data were expressed as the means ± SD. The comparisons
of LDH and CCK-8, and the immunoblot analyses
data at different testing time between groups were compared
by using Student’s t tests (for comparison between
two groups) or one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey
test (for comparison of three or more groups). The differences
between two groups were tested with the post
hoc least significant difference test. A value of P< 0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were conducted using the software Graph Pad
Prism Version5.0.
