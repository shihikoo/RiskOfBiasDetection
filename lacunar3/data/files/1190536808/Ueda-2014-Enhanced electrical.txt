Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can cause direct brain
injury at the insult site and indirect damage in remote
brain areas. Although a protective effect of melatonin
(ML) has been reported for ICH, its detailed mechanisms
and effects on remote brain injury remain unclear. To clarify
the mechanism of indirect neuroprotection after ICH,
we first investigated whether ML improved motor function
after ICH and then examined the underlying mechanisms.
The ICH model rat was made by collagenase injection
into the left globus pallidus, adjacent to the internal capsule.
ML oral administration (15 mg/kg) for 7 days after
ICH resulted in significant recovery of motor function.
Retrograde labeling of the corticospinal tract by Fluoro-
Gold revealed a significant increase in numbers of positive
neurons in the cerebral cortex. Immunohistological
analysis showed that ML treatment induced no difference
in OX41-positive activated microglia/macrophage at day
1 (D1) but a significant reduction in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosin-positive
cells at D7. Neutral red assay revealed that
ML significantly prevented H

O

-induced cell death in
cultured oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not in neurons.
Electrophysiological response in the cerebral cortex
area where the number of Fluoro-Gold-positive cells was
increased was significantly improved in ML-treated rats.
These data suggest that ML improves motor abilities after
ICH by protecting oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the
vicinity of the lesion in the corticospinal tract from oxidative
stress and causes enhanced electrical responsiveness
in the cerebral cortex remote to the ICH
pathology. V C 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Stroke including cerebral infarction and intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) is often fatal. Many pathological
events from the hemorrhage mass and blood metabolites
are induced after ICH, as previously described (Sinar
et al., 1987; Huang et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2003). Microangiopathy
by the mass, strong inflammation by blood
and its metabolites, and vasospasm after ICH likely cause
the primary brain damage near the lesion; indirect secondary
brain damage is also induced in areas remote to
the initial injury site.
Three models are commonly used to examine the
complex pathology of ICH, depending on experimental
purposes. One model involves blood injection into the
parenchyma, which often results in tissue destruction
(Yang et al., 1994). A second model uses a microballoon
to imitate space-occupying effects (Sinar et al., 1987).
The third model involves collagenase-induced ICH that
is induced by destruction of the basal lamina in the cerebral
capillaries, which causes bleeding into the brain tissue
(Rosenberg et al., 1990; Chesney et al., 1995; Del Bigio
et al., 1996; Altumbabic et al., 1998). Because brain damage
in collagenase-induced ICH includes many aspects of
the human pathology (mass effects, blood metabolites,
and inflammation), this model is suitable for investigating
serial events after ICH: primary brain damage by microangiopathy
, strong inflammation and vasospasm near the
hemorrhage, and indirect secondary brain damage in
remote areas.
Melatonin (ML) is a neuropeptide that acts as a
powerful antioxidant and free radical scavenger (Shinozuka
et al., 2013). Beneficial effects of ML have been

reported in articles describing studies of experimental subarachnoid
hemorrhage (Aladag et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2012), ischemic stroke (Chen et al., 2006; Hung et al.,
2008), and ICH (Hartman et al., 2008; Rojas et al., 2008;
Li et al. 2009; Lekic et al., 2010). ML administration also
improves cerebral circulation security margin (Regrigny
et al., 1998) and ameliorates cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoidal
hemorrhage (Aydin et al., 2005), with effects
on microangiopathy and vasospasm near the hemorrhage.
We previously developed a modified collagenaseinduced
ICH model that resulted in a small hemorrhoidal
lesion in the left external globus pallidus near the internal
capsule (IC), but with severe motor dysfunction (IC hemorrhage
model; Masuda et al., 2007a,b). A benefit of this
model is that it is easy to produce a small brain hemorrhage.
By using this model, we found that inhibition of
free radical production with an iron chelator enhanced
motor recovery after ICH and prevented neuronal cell
death in the sensorimotor cortex (remote area), likely by
an action on mature oligodendrocytes around the hemorrhage
rather than on neurons directly. However, the
mechanisms of action of antioxidant and free radical scavengers
, such as ML and iron chelators, in protection of
indirect secondary damage by ICH in remote areas
remain unclear.
To investigate the mechanism of indirect secondary
damage after hemorrhage near the IC, we first examined
whether oral intake of ML improves motor functional
behavior in IC hemorrhage model rats. We then investigated
the electrophysiological response to intracortical
microstimulation (ICMS) in the ipsilateral sensorimotor
cortex, where the effects of antioxidant and free radical
scavengers (ML and iron chelator) were observed after
ICH.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Wistar rats were housed under controlled temperature
on a 12-hr light–dark cycle with free access to food and
water. Experimental procedures and animal care were performed
according to the guidelines of the Institute for Experimental
Animal Science, Nagoya City University Medical
School. All surgeries were performed with anesthesia using
pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.).
ICH Model Rats
ICH model rats with a small hemorrhage near the IC
(IC-hemorrhage model) were produced as previously described
(Masuda et al., 2007a). In brief, male 8-week-old Wistar rats
received stereotactic injection of type IV collagenase (1.4 llof
7.5 U/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) into the left external globus
pallidus near the IC (3.8 mm lateral to the midline, 1.8 mm
caudal to the bregma, 5 mm below the brain surface) for 7 min
under anesthesia. After the injection, the needle was kept steady
for 5 min and then removed slowly.
ML (15 mg/kg; Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) dissolved
in 1 ml of peanut oil was given to animals through a
feeding tube. ML was administered every 24 hr for 7 days, from
6 hr after the lesion in the posttreated group and 1 hr before
the lesion in the pretreated group.
Behavioral Testing
Motor function tests (spontaneous ipsilateral rotation,
beam walk ability, bilateral forepaw grasping, and contralateral
hindlimb retraction) were evaluated 1, 3, and 7 days after the
lesion, as previously described (Altumbabic et al., 1998; Masuda
et al., 2007a). The tests were designed to rate motor dysfunction
more precisely into five degrees of severity, grades 0–4.
Spontaneous ipsilateral rotation was assessed for 5 min. The
beam walk ability test, which involved going back to the home
cages, was repeated three times in one trial. The bilateral forepaw
grasping test, measuring the ability to hold a 2-mm diameter
steel rod, was repeated 10 times in one trial. The
contralateral hindlimb retraction test that measures the ability to
replace the hindlimb after 20–30 mm lateral displacement was
repeated 20 times in one trial.
Retrograde Fluoro-Gold Labeling of Corticospinal
Neurons
To label the corticospinal tract, rats (pretreated group)
received laminectomy at the C3–4 level under anesthesia 14
days after ICH, and then 1ll of 2% Fluoro-Gold (FG; Biotium,
Hayward, CA) solution was injected into the center of the dorsal
corticospinal tract (1 mm deep from the dura) with a glass
micropipette (tip diameter 50–60 mm), as previously described
(Masuda et al., 2007a). Rats were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) under deep anesthesia.
The brain was removed and postfixed for 24 hr in the
same fixative, followed by cryoprotection in 20% sucrose in
0.1 M PB. Coronal sections (40 lm thick) of the sensorimotor
cortex (from 1.7 mm anterior to the bregma to 3.3 mm posterior
to the bregma) were cut and every 12th slice was used for
counting FG-positive cells. The pyramidal-shaped cells in the
bilateral sensorimotor cortices were counted under an Olympus
AX-70 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a
digital camera (Olympus DP-70) in Adobe Photoshop software
(Adobe Systems, Chatswood, Australia).
Histological Staining
To detect activated microglia/macrophage, PFA-fixed
coronal sections (40 lm thick) were incubated with an antimacrophage
/granulocyte monoclonal antibody (OX-41, 1:1,000;
Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 4C for 16 hr, followed by visualization
with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody
(1:500; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). OX-41-positive cells
were counted in five randomly selected images containing 425
3 320lm rectangular areas.
For detection of DNA damage by oxidative stress, PFA-
fixed coronal sections were incubated in citrate buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6.0, 121C) for 10 min and then in anti-8OHdG mouse
monoclonal antibody (1:10; Japan Institute for the Control of
Aging, Shizuoka, Japan) for 16 hr at 4C. Sections were incubated
in biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories
, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hr at RT, followed by alkaline
phosphatase binding avidin-biotin complex. Tissues were

processed for visualization with Vector red (Vector Laboratories
). Five rectangular fields (1003 130 mm) in the lesioned area
were randomly selected for counting 8OHdG-positive cells.
Cell Culture of Oligodendrocytes, Astrocytes, and
Neurons
For astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cultures, mixed glial
cultures were first prepared as previously described (Hida et al.,
1998; Mizuno et al., 2008). Eighty Wistar pups (P2–P3; SLC,
Shizuoka, Japan) were used for mixed glial cultures. Dissociated
cells from two cerebral cortices were plated in a 75-cm2 tissue
flask and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing 10% FCS (complete medium) for 7–12
days, with a medium change every 2–3 days. After vigorous
shaking of the flasks at 200 rpm at 37C for 20–22 hr, the
detached cells were collected, filtered through a 45-lm mesh, 
placed on 10-cm Petri dish for 30 min, and then transferred to a
culture dish (Falcon Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for
30 min to eliminate contaminating astrocytes and microglia. The
nonadherent cells (O-2A progenitors) were collected and plated
at densities of 2,500 cells/cm2 with complete medium. Twentyfour
hours later, O-2A progenitors were expanded for 4 days
with Neurobasal A medium plus B27 supplements (NBM/B27;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing 10 ng/ml platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF; Peprotech, London, United Kingdom)
and 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; Peprotech), followed
by induction to oligodendrocytes with NBM/B27 containing
10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; Peprotech)
and 15 nM 3,3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3; Sigma), for 10 days.
To obtain astrocytes, the flasks were again shaken at
200 rpm at 37C for an additional 6–8 hr with complete
medium. After being washed with PBS three times, cells were
incubated with 0.05% trypsin in PBS for 5 min at 37C. Dissociated
cells were replated on poly-L-lysine-coated culture dishes
at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and then cultured for 9 days
with complete medium.
To obtain cortical neurons, embryonic Wistar rat forebrains
(E17) were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in PBS and plated onto
poly-L-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 200,000 cells/cm2with
complete medium. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was
changed to NBM/B27 with culture for another 10 days.

(100 lM) challenge solution with ML (200
lM) dissolved in each basal medium plus 0.5% ethanol was
administered to cultured cells for 24 hr. ML (200 lM) was
mixed into the challenge medium for ML administration. To
check cell survivability, neutral red (150 lg/ml) was incorporated
for 3 hr. Cells were fixed with 1% PFA in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 1% CaCl
2
for 10 min. After removal of
the fixative, cells were washed with TBS three times. Incorporated
neutral red was extracted with 300 ll of 50% ethanol in
PBS containing 1% acetic acid for 20 min. Absorption of the
extracted solution was measured at 540 nm.
ICMS
To maintain constant anesthesia, ketamine (60 mg/kg)
and xylazine (10 mg/kg) were injected i.p., followed by injection
of a mixture of ketamine (30 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/
kg) into the muscle 30 min later. During the experiment, supplemental
injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg) was occasionally
performed when spontaneous movement of vibrissae or some
muscle was detected, followed by a break for at least 10 min to
prevent recording error resulting from deep anesthesia.
Rats were placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige,
Tokyo, Japan) 7 days after the lesion, and a craniotomy was
performed to expose the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. The
exposed area was 0–4.5 mm anterior and 0.5–4.0 mm lateral
from the bregma, where we previously had detected retrogradely
labeled FG-positive cells in the cortical area (Masuda
et al., 2007a). Under a microscope, a glass insulated tungsten
electrode (OD: 310 lm, 0.5–0.7 MX; Alpha Omega, 380–
080607-11) was injected into layer V of the cortex, and the
spike wave was checked with an oscilloscope. Thirty biphasic
pulses (0–200lA, 200lsec, 333 Hz) from an electrical stimulator
(Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) connected to an isolator
(SS-203J, Nihon Kohden) were given to the electrode every 2
sec, and the response of the cortex was amplified with an amplifier
(AM Systems, Carlsberg, WA) connected to an oscilloscope.
The forelimb twitches (shoulder, elbow, wrist, and digit)
were sensed by palpation. The minimal threshold required to
evoke the movement was recorded, giving the pulses starting
from 0 lA. If a twitch was not evoked at 200 lA, it was
defined as a nonresponsive area.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean6SEM. Student’s t-test
was used for comparisons between treatments in the number of
FG-positive corticospinal neurons, 8OHdG-positive cells, and
antioxidant effect of melatonin on cultured neurons, oligodendrocytes
, and astrocytes. Behavioral scores and the ICMS
threshold were compared between groups by using the Mann-
Whitney U-test.
RESULTS
Ameliorated Motor Dysfunction by ML Oral
Administration
Rats were housed under controlled temperature in a
12-hr light–dark cycle, because there are well-described
effects of ML on circadian rhythm. To investigate
whether ML ameliorated motor dysfunction in the IC-
hemorrhage model, which involves a small hemorrhage
near the IC but relatively large functional deficits (Masuda
et al., 2007a), motor function tests (spontaneous ipsilateral
rotation, beam walk ability, bilateral forepaw grasping,
and contralateral hindlimb retraction) were evaluated 1
day (D1), D3, and D7 after the lesion (Fig. 1A). At D7,
the score of motor function tests showed significant differences
in the pre-ML-treated group (6.1160.35,

n59) compared with the prevehicle-treated group
(7.9560.25, n519; Fig. 1B). This effect was also shown
in cases in which ML was administered after the lesion
(post-ML-treated, 5.7960.47, n514; postvehicletreated
, 7.9260.40, n512; Fig. 1B).
A relatively small hemorrhage was detected around
the IC after the lesion in both groups (Fig. 1C). However,
no significant difference in semiquantitative assessment of
the damaged area was shown between the post-ML-treated
group (10.661.8 mm3,n58) and the postvehicle-treated
group (12.961.3 mm3,n58; Fig. 1D).
Reduced Damage in the Corticospinal Tract by ML
To investigate whether ML protects the damage
around the IC in the corticospinal tract, FG retrograde
labeling was first performed by injection into the dorsal
corticospinal tract at C3–C4 14 days after the lesion, and
then FG-positive neurons were assessed in the
sensorimotor cortices 7 days later (Fig. 2A). In the ipsilateral
cortex of the vehicle-treated and ML-treated groups,
FG-labeled neurons were noticeably decreased compared
with the contralateral cortex (Fig. 2B). However, ML
treatment resulted in an increase of FG-labeled neurons in
the ipsilateral cortex compared with vehicle treatment
(Fig. 2B). Assessment of FG-positive neurons in the cortex
revealed a significant increase at 1.7 mm anterior to
the bregma in the ML-treated group (135.2627.0,
n55, P<0.05) compared with the vehicle-treated group
(53.1623.9, n56; Fig. 2C). A trend for an increase was
also detected in the ML-treated group at 1.2 mm
(P50.082) compared with the vehicle-treated group.
Reduction of DNA Oxidative Damage by ML in
the Perihemorrhage Area
For evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of ML,
activated microglia and macrophages were immunostained

A: A small hemorrhage was made by collagenase injection into the

dissolved in 1 ml of peanut oil was given to animals through a feeding

hr after the lesion. Pretreated group received additional administration
of ML 1 hr before the lesion. Motor function tests (spontaneous ipsilateral
rotation, beam walk ability, bilateral forepaw grasping, contralateral
hindlimb retraction) were performed at D1, D3, and D7 after
the lesion, followed by immunostaining. B: Disturbed motor function

with H&E. The deeply hematoxylin-stained areas in the cavity were
defined as damaged regions. By semiquantitative evaluation by damaged
volume, there was no significant difference between the postvehicle
treated group and the post-ML treated group.

with OX-41 24 hr after the lesion. In the perihemorrhage
area, numerous positive cells were observed in both
groups, with a similar cell density (Fig. 3A). There was no
significant difference in the number of OX-41-positive
cells between the vehicle-treatment (45.562.1, n53)
and ML-treatment (43.963.4, n55) groups (Fig. 3B).
To evaluate DNA oxidative stress in perihemorrhage-damaged
areas, 8OHdG immunostaining was performed
7 days after the lesion. Although 8OHdG-positive
cells were observed in both groups (Fig. 3C), the number
of positive cells was significantly decreased in the ML
group (21.363.6, n56) compared with the vehicle
group (36.365.2, n56; Fig. 3D).
Protection by ML to Glial Cells Against Oxidative
Stress In Vitro
Because neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes
are involved in the perihemorrhage-damaged area near
the IC, the protective effects of ML against oxidative
stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (100 lM H 
2
O
2
)
were investigated in cell cultures (Fig. 4). Cell viability of
cultured neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was
evaluated by neutral red incorporation into lysosomes in
living cells (neutral red assay). No significant difference
was found with ML treatment to neurons after oxidative
stress (74.0%63.8%, n54) compared with vehicle treatment
(64.2%63.7%, n54, P50.115), although there
was a trend for increased cell viability (Fig. 4A). In cultured
oligodendrocytes, ML treatment after oxidative
stress (91.9%62.2%, n53) significantly increased cell
survival compared with vehicle treatment (61.4%64.3%,
n53; Fig. 4B). A similar effect of ML was observed in
astrocyte cultures (ML treatment, 108.0%65.7%, n53;
vehicle treatment, 73.3%63.1%, n53; Fig. 4C).
To rule out the possibility that cell proliferation by
ML caused the increase of neutral red uptake, the cell
populations, at 24 hr after ML treatment, were evaluated

cortices are shown. Ipsilateral cortex of ML-treated group

group compared with the vehicle-treated group. *P<0.05, Student’s

Melatonin Decreases the Motor Area Threshold
After ICH
To investigate the electrical responses in the ipsilateral
motor cortex at 7 days after ICH, rats received
ICMS, in which electrical stimuli (0.2 msec, 0–200 lA,
333 Hz) were given to layer V of the sensorimotor cortex
to evoke twitches in the contralateral lower-leg joints
(Fig. 5). ICMS was performed near the area where the
number of cortical FG-positive cells was significantly
different (0.7–2.7 mm anterior to the bregma,
1.0–3.0 mm lateral to the midline; Figs. 2C, 5A).
The cortical area in which the muscle twitches were
evoked by maximal stimuli (200 lA) became wider after
ML administration (Fig. 5B); the medial area of nine
stimulated areas showed low responses in the vehicle
group, whereas most regions became responsive in the
ML-treated group. The threshold to evoke the twitches
in the nine stimulated regions is shown in Figure 5C,
with a decrease in the medial regions (3, 5, and 6) that
corresponded to the site where FG-positive cells were
increased by ML (Fig. 2C).
DISCUSSION
To investigate the mechanism of indirect secondary damage
in the cortex after a small hemorrhage in the left
globus pallidus near the IC (IC hemorrhage model), we
examined the effect of ML on disturbed motor function
in this model and the electrophysiological response to
ICMS in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, where the
beneficial effects of antioxidant and free radical scavengers
were observed. We showed that ML oral administration
1) improved motor dysfunctions in IC hemorrhage model
rats, 2) prevented the decrease of retrogradely labeled FG-
positive cortical neurons, and 3) prevented the increase of
8OHdG-positive cells (oxidative stress) after the lesion.
Additionally, ML application against oxidative stress by

challenge in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes compared
with neurons. Furthermore, ML treatment after the lesion
5) caused enhanced electrical responsiveness in the ipsilateral
cortex after a small hemorrhage near the IC.
ML Acts as an Antioxidant and Free Radical
Scavenger in IC Hemorrhage Model Rats
Although several articles have reported a protective
effect of ML in ICH (Hartmann et al., 2008; Rojas et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2009; Lekic et al., 2010), we also found
that ML administration improved functional recovery in
an alternative subcortical hemorrhage model, in which a
small hemorrhage near the IC with relatively large functional
deficits is produced by stereotaxic collagenase
injection.
Numerous mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology
in IC hemorrhage model rats, including
mechanical damage, local ischemia, oxidative stress,
edema, and inflammation induced by the volume effect of
hematoma, blood components, and blood degradation
products (Xi et al., 2006). Accumulation of iron after
ICH has been reported by Wu et al. (2003), and iron
overload is involved in oxidative stress after ICH (Youdim
et al., 1990; Nakamura et al., 2004; Masuda et al.,
2007a). Therefore, it is likely that oxidative stress,
enhanced by catalytic generation of the hydroxyl radical
by free iron, is an important mechanism in tissue damage
after ICH.
Many properties of ML have been described,
including a neuroprotective effect in glutamate excitotoxicity
(Giusti et al., 1995), an inhibiting effect in proinflammatory
cytokine production (Lissoni et al., 1997),
and anti-inflammatory effects in COX-1 activity (Mayo
et al., 2005) or nuclear factor-jB binding to DNA
(Lezoualc’h et al., 1998). In addition, a powerful antioxidant
and a free radical scavenger of ML were recently

ED-1-positive cells were detected in the perihemorrhage area at D1
in both vehicle- and ML-treated cells. B: OX-41-positive cells were
counted in five randomly selected images containing 425 3 320 lm

described by Shinozuka et al. (2013). Their study found a
significant decrease in the number of 8OHdG-positive
cells near the lesion area in the IC model. Thus, it is likely
that ML produced a greater antioxidant effect, rather than
an anti-inflammatory effect. In support of this, we found
no effect of ML on the increased numbers of amoeboid
activated OX-41 cells (the M1 phenotype) observed after
ICH (Taylor and Sansing, 2013; Miron and Franklin,
2014), suggesting no difference in the release of inflammatory
cytokines.
A protective effect of ML on oxidative stress (DNA
oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation) was reported in
vivo by Reiter et al. (2002) and Zavodnik et al. (2006). A
direct scavenging action to hydroxyl radicals (Tan et al.,
1993), peroxyl radicals (Marshall et al., 1996), and nitric
oxide (Noda et al., 1999) has been shown. An indirect
antioxidant effect by increasing endogenous antioxidant
activity, enhancing mRNA levels (Reiter, 2000) and
inhibiting one of the nitric oxide synthase isoforms (Gilad
et al., 1997), has also been shown. Thus, the actions of
ML in IC model rats are likely mediated by both direct
and indirect antioxidant activities.
Glial Cells in the IC Are Primary Targets of ML in
Subcortical Hemorrhage Model Rats
Although the main cellular target of ML remains
controversial, glial cells might be involved in our subcortical
hemorrhage model rats, given that ML treatment
against oxidative stress in vitro increased cell viability in
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not neurons. The IC,
a subcortical deep area, is composed mainly of oligodendrocytes
and axons, although reactive astrocytes and
inflammatory cells were also observed in the IC after the
lesion (data not shown). Because ML readily diffuses into
neurons and glial cells equally (Reiter et al., 1998), we
hypothesize that oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the
IC are main primary targets of ML in our model. Our
previous finding supports the idea that ML directly protected
astrocytes from nitric oxide toxicity or ATP depletion
in the striatum (Borlongan et al., 2000).
It is likely that ML protects neurons and axons in
the IC via protection of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes
around the lesion, which can release neurotrophic factors
such as nerve growth factor (NGF; Yamakuni et al.,
1987; Byravan et al., 1994), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF; Schaar et al., 1993; Wilkins et al.
2003), CNTF (Rudge et al., 1992), FGF-2 (Unsicker
et al., 1987; Hatten et al., 1988), FGF-9 (Nakamura et al.,
1999), transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b; da Cunha
et al., 1993), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1;
Wilkins et al., 2001). It is also possible that the neurons
and axons in the IC could be rescued by the M2 phenotype
of microglia/macrophage (Taylor and Sansing, 2013;
Miron and Franklin, 2014). However, ML administration
to the IC hemorrhage model rats induced no change in
the number of OX-41-positive cells and no obvious morphological
alteration (not shown), suggesting less protection
of neurons and axons in the IC by M2-type
microglia/macrophages.
Although this study focused on corticospinal tract
damage, it is likely that reduced damage in other areas
also participates in the enhanced recovery of motor function
in ML-treated rats, including the striatum, thalamus,
and ascending sensory tract. Nevertheless, the reduced
injury in the corticospinal tract by ML administration
Fig. 4. ML protected both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from oxidative
stress in vitro. Cell cultures of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and
astrocytes were prepared to examine the protective effects of ML
against oxidative stress by 100 lM for 24 hr. A: Neurons from
embryonic rat forebrains (E17) were cultured with NBM/B27 for 10

challenge in neuronal cultures, although there was a
trend for neuroprotection (n54, P50.115). B,C: For astrocyte and
oligodendrocyte cultures, mixed glial cells were first prepared. Astrocytes
were cultured at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 for 9 days with
complete medium (B). Oligodendrocytes were prepared from O-2A
progenitors that were expanded with PDGF and FGF2, which were
finally inducted with CNTF and T3 for 10 days (C). A significant
protective effect of ML on oxidative stress was found in both astrocyte
(B) and oligodendrocyte (C) cultures. *P<0.05, Student’s t-test in

might be a major factor involved in the enhanced functional
recovery.
Enhanced Electrical Responsiveness in the Cortex
Is Mediated by Reduced Corticospinal Tract
Damage
Assessment of electrophysiological responsiveness in
the sensorimotor cortex by ICMS revealed that the
medial part of regions assessed became more responsive to
ICMS induction of forelimb twitches and exhibited a
reduced threshold to evoke limb twitches in ML-treated
rats (Fig. 5). The points of the enhanced responsiveness
corresponded to the area where FG-positive corticospinal
neurons were increased by ML administration (Fig. 2C),
and these points are linked to forelimb movement.
Therefore, the enhanced cortical responsiveness following
oral ML intake may explain the improved functional
recovery, especially in the forehand limb area at D7.
Overall, we suggest that the effect of ML on functional
recovery in our IC hemorrhage model rats is not a
direct effect on the corticospinal tract but rather an indirect
effect on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the IC.
ML oral administration protects against oxidative stress in
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes near the IC, culminating
in enhanced electrical responsiveness in the cerebral cortex
of the forehand limb area mediated by reduced corticospinal
tract damage.
CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that ML reduced corticospinal axon
damage near the lesion site by reducing oxidative stress
and protecting astrocytes and oligodendrocytes around
the lesion. Thus, the enhanced recovery of motor function
in the IC hemorrhage model, at least in part, resulted
from neuroprotection of ipsilateral cortical neurons in
regions distant from the lesion area.
Fig. 5. Melatonin altered the reaction of ICMS. Electrical response in
the ipsilateral motor cortex after IC hemorrhage was investigated by
ICMS, in which electrical stimuli (0.2 msec, 0–200 lA, 333 Hz) were
administered to layer V neurons. The contralateral twitches in the
lower-leg joints were assessed by palpation. Craniotomy was performed
to expose the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex (0–4.5 mm
anterior and 0.5–4.0 mm lateral to the bregma). The electrode was
placed into nine points (1–9) around the area where ML treatment
resulted in an increase of FG-labeled neurons (Fig. 2B). IC hemorrhage
rats were divided into the vehicle-treated group (n56) and the
ML-treated group (n56). Minimal threshold required to evoke the
movement of the lower-leg joints was investigated. Areas where a
maximum stimulus of 200 lA failed to evoke a twitch were defined
as nonresponsive. B: Number of “responsive areas” in nine points (1–
9) is shown as a ratio; for example, 2/6 indicates that two animals of
six were responsive. The cortical area in which the maximal stimulus
evoked the twitch became wider with ML administration. C: Average
minimal thresholds at the nine points (1–9) are shown. Note that the
threshold in the “nonresponsive areas” was 200 lA for the evaluation.
The thresholds at points 3, 5, and 6 were significantly decreased with
ML treatment. *P<0.05, Student’s t-test.
