Background:Currentlyusedtechniquesfordiagnosingischemicinjury,suchasmagneticresonanceimaging and computed tomography, are not easily accessible for basic research using small animals due to
their high cost and low availability.
New method: We investigated the dynamic recovery of infarct regions in ischemia-injured brains using
indocyanine green (ICG), which is inexpensive and readily available. This dye was used to visualize blood
vessels and infarct area, and to measure blood flow after a photothrombotic ischemic operation (PIO).
MicewereinjectedwithICGviathetailvein,andatime-seriesoffluorescencesignalimageswasacquired
before and after PIO. We then applied color codes to arteries and veins in the images and analyzed ICG
intensity and dynamics.
Results: These time-series stacked images showed changes in pial vessel morphology after PIO. Further,
a map of maximum fluorescence intensity showed an infarct in the dorsal cortical region. Changes in the
blood flow index and mean transit time were also observed in the infarct region after PIO.
Comparison with existing method(s): Our application of ICG imaging provided a range of information on
PIO-induced infarcts in mice with relative ease and in a cost-effective manner.
Conclusion: Our results show that optical imaging using ICG combined with a time-series analysis of
molecular dynamics can be a useful tool for the anatomical and physiological monitoring of cortical
ischemia.

1. Introduction
Manycellularevents,suchascelldeath,inflammation,andrehabilitation of surviving cells occur after ischemic injury to the brain.
After the onset of ischemia, new vessel formation and/or remodeling of preexisting vasculature takes place (Silvestre et al., 2013),
which controls the recovery of blood flow and determines the
extent of the ischemic injury. Therefore, a follow-up of multiple

aspectsrelatedtorecoveryafterbrainischemia(e.g.,changeinvasculature
, size of infarct area, and blood flow) is very important for
the diagnosis and monitoring of a stroke injury. Methods that have
been widely used for the diagnosis of ischemic injury in humans,
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), have limitations in their application to basic research
because of their high cost and low availability (Hillman, 2007).
The fluorescent probe indocyanine green (ICG) is excited in the
near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (Desmettre et al., 2000), and
deep tissue penetration of NIR wavelength light is possible because
of a lesser degree of absorption and scattering (Ntziachristos et al.,
2003). This allows for the acquisition of clear deep-tissue images

without the use of invasive techniques. ICG is also useful for the
accurate identification of feeder and drainer vessels within tissues
, as the wash-in time of the dye can be measured (Towle
et al., 2012). In addition, analysis of ICG molecular dynamics
has been used to semi-quantitatively estimate peripheral tissue
and brain perfusion in mice (Kang et al., 2009; Ku and Choi,
2012).
In this study, we assessed changes in pial vasculature, infarct
area, and blood flow in infarct regions using ICG molecular dynamics.Toenhancevisibilityofbloodvesselsandtoidentifythearteries
andveinsintheinfarctregionoftheischemicbrain,weusedacolorcoding method (Kalchenko et al., 2014) according to the dynamics
of ICG. We also analyzed infarct areas and blood flow by mapping
cerebral blood flow parameters such as maximum intensity (Imax),
blood flow index (BFI), and mean transit time (MTT) in the dorsal
cortical area. To induce brain ischemia, we used the photothrombotic ischemia model with Rose Bengal (Watson et al., 1985). This

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal preparation
Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n=8 for imaging, n=12
for triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining) were obtained from
Daehan Biolink (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). All animals
were maintained on 12-h light/dark cycle during the experimental period. All operating procedures were performed according
to the ARRIVE guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/ARRIVE) and
wereapprovedbytheInstitutionalAnimalCareandUseCommittee
at the Kyung Hee University.
2.2. Indocyanine green imaging
Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of Zoletil (30mg/kg; Virbac Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and
Rompun (10mg/kg; Bayer Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Animal temperature was maintained during operations at 37±0.5 ◦C
using a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA,
USA). An incision was first made to expose the entire skull, and
the mouse was then placed under a CCD camera equipped with an
830-nm wavelength filter. ICG (0.001mg/gwt) was injected into
the tail vein, and the head was illuminated with 760-nm wavelengthlights.Time-seriesofICGfluorescencesignalswereacquired
every 160ms for 2min. The initial 30–40 frames were used to generate a color map of cerebral vessels, while the initial 100 frames
were used to generate blood flow maps and calculate blood flow
in the cerebral cortex using customized software (Vieworks Co.,
Ltd., Anyang, Republic of Korea), according to previous reports
by Kalchenko et al. (2014) and Ku and Choi (2012). The slope of
the first peak in the time-intensity curve was used to calculate
the BFI, dividing the relative fluorescence intensity at the time of
the first peak (Tpeak) by the time elapsed between ICG detection
and ICG maximum intensity (Trising). MTT was then calculated as
the center of gravity of the dynamic curve (Gobbel et al., 1991).
ICG images for each animal were taken at the following four time
points pre- and post-photothrombotic ischemic operation (PIO):
1 day before PIO (pre-PIO) and 1, 5, and 30 days after PIO (post-
PIO).
2.3. Photothrombotic ischemic operation
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
Zoletil (30mg/kg) and Rompun (10mg/kg). Animal temperature
wasmaintainedduringoperationsat37±0.5 ◦Cwithahomeothermicblanket(HarvardApparatus,Holliston,MA,USA).Theskullwas
exposed through a median incision of the skin, and the periosteum
over the skull was removed completely. For illumination, a fiberoptic bundle of a cold light source (Olympus LCD, 150W) with a
3-mm aperture was centered at 2mm lateral and 2mm caudal to
bregma. Rose Bengal (0.1mL/25g body weight of a 10% solution;
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo, USA) was injected into the tail vein,
after which the skull was illuminated for 3min with the cool light.
Following imaging, the scalp was sutured and mice were allowed
to recover.
2.4. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining
For vital staining, brains were removed at different times
(i.e., pre-PIO, 1, 5, and 30 days post-PIO) and were immediately
immersedin2%triphenyltetrazoliumchloride(TTC)in0.9%NaClat
37 ◦Cfor10min.Brainswerethenphotographed,andtheunstained
area of the hemisphere was measured.
2.5. Statistical analysis
AllstatisticalparameterswerecalculatedusingGraphpadPrism
4.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA). Data are expressed as the
mean±standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Results were analyzed
using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni
’s post hoc test. Differences with a p-value lower than 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Dynamic color mapping of cerebral blood vessels in the
infarct region
After intravenous ICG injection, raw images were acquired and
streamed to a computer. In raw fluorescent images, blood vessels
appeared as bright areas. Images acquired from animals pre-PIO,
and 1 and 30 days post-PIO (see Video data) were recorded frameby-frame as video sequences that showed blood flow kinetics. To
determine blood vessel contrast to the parenchymal area of the
brain, images from the 30 to 40 frame of the time-series, fluorescent
, white/black images were stacked and edge–enhanced
(Fig. 1A). White pixels in vessels specified that images were coded
for arteries (red), veins (blue), and sinuses (green) (i.e., superior
sagittal sinus) according to the difference in time it took ICG
to reach a specified intensity (Fig. 1B and C). Fluorescent image
processing and coding was accomplished using customized software (Vieworks Co., Ltd., Anyang, Republic of Korea), which after
processing, allowed images to separately show arteries, veins, and
sinuses (Fig. 1D).
3.2. Changes of pial vasculature in the infarct region after PIO
Using the color-coded images, we visualized changes in cerebral vasculature in the infarct region after PIO. One day post-PIO,
vessels in the infarct area were not detected with ICG imaging
(Fig. 1E), suggesting that there was no blood flow in the pial
vessels after thrombosis. Five days post-PIO, some vessels were
detected in the infarct region, while vessels with aberrant morphology were detected at 30 days post-injury. To quantify changes
in vasculature in the core of the infarct region, we analyzed the
percentage of pixels that showed fluorescence intensity above
threshold (100 a.u.) in the region of interest (ROI) (Fig. 1F). The vasculature area in the infarct region increased along with days after
PIO injury.

3.3. Change of infarct area after PIO
To visualize the infarct area through the intact skull, we created
a map of Imax using time-series ICG dynamics. Of all the cerebral blood flow parameters, the Imax map yielded a high-resolution
image of the dorsal cortical brain. We selected a single tone color
scale (in this case brown) for the Imax map to specify the infarct
in the dorsal cortical region. Fig. 2A shows follow-up images of an
Imax map from one animal before and after PIO, demonstrating a
change in the infarct area. One day post-PIO, the infarct area was
clearly visible as light yellow bordered with brown, and this area
was observed to decrease in size with time (Fig. 2A). The area of the
light yellow region in the ICG Imax map image was measured using
the customized software, and this was also observed to reduce in
size over time (Fig. 2B). To compare the real infarct area to the Imax
map image, we performed TTC staining at each time point before
and after PIO in a new set of animals. Interestingly, the TTC staining
image was almost a perfect match of the Imax map image (Fig. 2C).
Finally, we determined that the dorsal infarct area was reduced
post-PIO (Fig. 2D).
3.4. Change of cerebral blood flow in the infarct region after PIO
Wenextexaminedcerebralbloodflowparametersintheinfarct
region post-PIO. BFI, which shows the degree of blood infusion,
decreased conspicuously in the infarct region 1 day after operation,
butrecoveredthereafter(Fig.3AandB).ThepatternofchangeinBFI
was similar to the change in vasculature, which indicated that pial
vessels were the determining factor of BFI in the cerebral cortex.
MTT, which indicates the mean blood transit time, increased after
operation. Matching the area of high MTT in the infarct 1 day post-
PIO to the pial vessels of the pre-PIO vasculature showed that after
photothrombotic injury, blood outflow in the vessels of the infarct
region decreased dramatically (Fig. 3C and D).
4. Discussion
In this study, we show for the first time the dynamic timecourse changes in pial vasculature, infarct area, and blood flow in
ischemic brains using imaging with ICG through the intact skull.
We were able to image the cerebral vasculature with high spatial resolution, and calculated blood flow parameters using the
dynamics of the bolus of ICG in the brain. Our findings indicate
that ICG is a good tool for investigating changes after ischemic
injury.
Recently, Hong et al. (2014) performed non-invasive brain
imaging that penetrated through the intact skin and skull using
carbon-nanotubesandfarNIRquantum-dotfluorescentmolecules.
However, the image of the pial vasculature did not clearly show the
branching of the vessels. Kalchenko et al. (2014) performed in vivo

imaging of cerebral blood vessels using laser speckle microscopy,
which produces detailed images of brain vasculature. In this study,
we selectively showed the pial arteries, veins, and their branches,
both before and after ischemic injury. Thus, our method could
help elucidate the process of blood flow recovery in the infarct
region.
MRI and CT scans are widely used for real-time noninvasive
measurement of infarct areas in ischemic brains. These methods
possess some advantages, including their capacity to scan whole
brain regions with high resolution. However, these methods are
not readily available to all researchers, are expensive to use, and
in the case of CT scanning, pose risk of radiation. In contrast to
thesemethods,ICGimagingiswidelyavailableandprovidesquality
information on brain infarcts at a low cost with no risk of radiation.
One drawback to this method, however, is that it is only available
for dorsal cortical areas and has lower resolution than MRI. ICG

imaging can also be used to assess various aspects of ICG molecule
dynamics. In the current study, we used the arrival time map, peak
time, and rising time of ICG (Ku and Choi, 2012); however, these
parameters did not provide us with enough resolution to image the
infarct region. On the other hand, we found that Imax maps showed
the exact image of the infarct area, which was confirmed by TTC
staining post-PIO. TTC staining indicates the respiration of living
cells, and is used to differentiate between metabolically active and
inactive tissues. The Imax map represents the maximum volume of
ICG in tissue, which indicates the degree of cortical blood flow. The
fact that TTC staining and Imax map images matched suggests that
recovery of blood circulation in the infarct area is a good indicator
of cell survival/recovery from ischemia.
The imaging results of this study showed that the recovery
of pial vasculature post-ischemic injury matches the recovery of blood flow of infarct area of photothrombotic ischemic
brain. After ischemia, pial arterial blood infusion shown in BFI
map dramatically dropped in the infarct area, which reduced
pial vessel area of infarct region in the ICG image. Blocking
the arteries using photothrombosis reduced blood flow in the
veins, which increase the MTT value in vein demonstrated in
the MTT map 1 day after operation. Our study showed that
imaging of the infarct area using ICG post-ischemia can provide
detailed information on changes in blood vessels and blood flow,
and that these changes match those occurring in the vasculature.
5. Conclusions
The present study demonstrated that ICG imaging could simultaneously show anatomical and physiological recovery of an
infarct region in an ischemic brain. Further, this image analysis
method could prove useful in evaluating the effects of therapeutic treatments following brain injury. Lastly, this method allows for
measurement of active changes in the infarct region, which makes
it ideal for use in animal studies.
