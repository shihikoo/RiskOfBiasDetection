Abstract—Background: Minocycline, a second-generation
tetracycline alleviates neuro-inflammation and protects the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) in ischemia stroke. However, the
effect of minocycline in hypoxia-induced BBB damage is
unclear. Here, we have investigated the effect of minocycline
under hypoxia and explored its possible underlying mechanisms. Methods: The effect of minocycline was examined
in vitro in Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells
(HBMECs) using Trans Epithelial Electric Resistance
(TEER). Protein and mRNA expression of Hypoxia-Inducible
Factors-1a (HIF-1a), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and
MMP-9) and tight junction proteins (TJs) were detected by
using Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription–p
olymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The translocation and
transcription of HIF-1awere detected by using immunocytochemistryandluciferasereporter
assay.In vivo, toadult male
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats under hypobaric hypoxia were
administered minocycline for 1 h and BBB permeability was
tested by using Evans Blue and Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM). Also, reduction of NAD-dependent
deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT-3)/proline hydroxylase-2 (PHD-2)
signaling pathway was evaluated. Results: Minocycline
increased TEER in HBMECs after hypoxia (P< 0.05), and
reduced the extravasation of Evans Blue (P< 0.05) and colloidal
gold nanoparticles in rats. Minocycline administration
significantly reduced HIF-1a expression, protein and mRNA
expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor (VEGF) (P< 0.05), and increased TJs
(ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding) (P< 0.05) in HBMECs after
hypoxia. Furthermore, minocycline reversed the
hypoxia-induced reduction of PHD-2 (P< 0.05) and SIRT-3
(P< 0.05). Effects of minocycline were abolished by siRNA-
mediated knockdown of SIRT-3 in the brain. Conclusions:
Minocycline inhibits HIF-1a-mediated cellular responses
and protects BBB integrity through SIRT-3/PHD-2 pathway,
proving to be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment
of hypoxic brain injuries.  2015 IBRO. Published by

INTRODUCTION
Hypoxia is an important pathophysiological process
induced by various diseases and tissue damages,
including tumors (Wilson and Hay, 2011) and cerebral
apoplexy (Jiang et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2011), though
it can also exist under extreme environmental conditions
such as high altitude (Hackett and Roach, 2004;
Basnyat, 2005). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) acts as a
‘‘guardian’’ of the central nervous system (Obermeier
et al., 2013). As a physical and metabolic barrier, BBB
separates peripheral circulation and the central nervous
system and regulates and protects the brain microenvironment
(Hawkins and Davis, 2005; Obermeier et al.,
2013). At high-altitude areas, some people might initially
develop headaches, which is one of the most important
symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) (Basnyat,
2005), and a fewer people even face high-altitude coma
(Hackett and Roach). AMS and high-altitude coma have
been attributed to cerebral edema, which have been
thought to be closely related to the inflammation and
increase in BBB permeability (Hackett, 1999; Hackett
and Roach, 2004; Bailey et al., 2009; Baneke, 2010).
Much less is known about the inflammatory response
to hypoxic BBB injury. Several studies have documented

an induction of pro-inflammatory genes in rodent’s retinas
following hypoxia, including Hypoxia-Inducible Factors-1a
(HIF-1a) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
(VEGF). Inhibition of HIF-1a reduces BBB damage and
improves recovery from cerebral ischemia in rats (Yeh
et al., 2007; Ogunshola and Al-Ahmad, 2012), possibly
by reducing levels of VEGF, and attenuating the expression
of caspase-3 and p53 (Chen et al., 2009). Sirtuin-3
(SIRT-3), a major mitochondria NAD+-dependent
deacetylase, is reported to destabilize HIF-1a and regulate
VEGF (Li et al., 2014b), which may involve in BBB
damage during hypoxia. However, only few studies have
examined the consequence of inflammatory gene expression
and there are only few suitable therapeutics for AMS
and high-altitude coma.
Minocycline belongs to the second generation of
tetracyclines, which is considered to be a safe first-line
antibiotic (Elewa et al., 2006; Buller et al., 2009).
Besides its anti-inflammatory properties, minocycline
has extensive nerve protective effects (Elewa et al.,
2006; Yenari et al., 2006; Buller et al., 2009). Unlike other
antibiotics, minocycline can easily cross the BBB and
reach the brain white matter. Drug concentration of
minocycline in the brain is about 35% of its concentration
in blood, which benefits from its lipotropy and small
molecular properties (Buller et al., 2009). As a microglia
inhibitor, minocycline prevents neuro-inflammation and
reduces brain damages by a variety of brain insults like
cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral trauma and spinal cord
injury (Elewa et al., 2006; Buller et al., 2009; Zhao
et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2014).
In this study, we first investigated the effect of
minocycline on BBB under hypoxia condition using
Trans Epithelial Electric Resistance (TEER), Evans Blue
and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) in vitro
and in vivo. We then explored the mRNA and protein
levels of HIF-1a, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, ZO-1 and
Cluadin-5 in hypoxia in vitro, and assessed the
transcriptional regulation of HIF-1a/VEGF by luciferase
reporter assay. Finally, we examined the effect of
siRNA-mediated knockdown of the SIRT-3 on the
expression of SIRT-3, proline hydroxylase-2 (PHD-2)
and HIF-1a and on permeability change by Evans Blue
in vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture
Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HBMECs)
were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories
(ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The HBMECs were cultured in endothelial cell complete
medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) in a 37C incubator with 5% CO
2
, according
to the supplier’s instructions. Cells displayed a
cobblestone appearance, which is morphologically
normal for endothelial cells. All treatments were
performed after the HBMECs were confluent.
Hypoxia was achieved by a mixture of ultra-high purity
gases (1% O
2
, 5% CO 
2
and 94% N
2
) in an incubator
(Thermo Fisher, Louis, MO, USA). Minocycline was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and
dissolved in DMOG to make a stock solution of 101 mM
and then diluted in endothelial cell medium at 40.0lM,
20.0lM, 10.0lM, 5.0lM and 2.5lM. YC-1
(purity > 99%) was purchased from Sigma (Louis, MO,
USA). In the control group the same concentration of
DMSO in endothelial cell medium was added. The
potential toxic effect of minocycline on the cell viability
was examined by the MTT method in 96-well cell culture
clusters (Costar, Millipore). The number of replicates per
experiment was five independently (n= 5). After
administration, all cells were rinsed with heparin in order
to remove any lipoproteins attached to the cell surface.
Animals
A total of 120 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (275–
300 g), were obtained from Laboratory Animal Center,
The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.
Rats were housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF)
conditions and had free access to water and food. The
animal experiments were approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University.
Animal experiments were divided into two parts, the
first step was divided into Sea level environment (group
normoxia), hypoxia (group control) and three different
minocycline treatment groups (45 mg/kg, 22.5 mg/kg,
90 mg/kg, six rats in each group); In the second step,
rats were randomly divided into six groups (12 rats in
each group): Sea level environment (group normoxia),
hypoxia alone (group control), hypoxia + minocycline
(group MNC), hypoxia + minocycline + siRNA Negative
control (group MNC + siCtrl), hypoxia + minocycline +
siRNA GAPDH positive control (group MNC +
siGAPDH), and hypoxia + minocycline + siRNA SIRT-3
(group MNC + siSIRT-3). The animals in group
normoxia were placed in a normal environment, while
those in group control, MNC, MNC + siCtrl, MNC +
siGAPDH and MNC + siSIRT-3 were placed in a
hypobaric chamber simulating at an elevation of 8000 m
for 24 h and then immediately sacrificed in 5000 m. The
rats in groups MNC + siCtrl, MNC + siGAPDH and
MNC + siSIRT-3 were given siRNA via intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) infusion of two siRNAs (He et al.,
2012) with the following coordinates: 1.5 mm posterior,
1.0 mm lateral, and 3.2 mm below the horizontal plane
of the bregma at 24 h before hypoxia. The sequence of
the first siRNA for SIRT-3 was: Sense, 50-CCAGUGGC
AUUCCAGACUUTT-30; antisense, 50AAGUCUGGAAUG
CCACUGGTT-30. The second siRNA sequence was:
sense, 50-GCCCGACAUUGUUUCUUUTT-30; antisense,
50-AAAGAACACAAUGUCGGGCTT-30. The irrelevant
scrambled RNA served as a control (Dharmacon/
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, Colo, MA, USA).
RNAs in sterile RNase-free water were injected at a rate
of 0.5ll/min (20lM, 10ll) for 24 h before the animals
were exposed to the hypobaric chamber. MNC,
MNC + siCtrl, MNC + siGAPDH and MNC + siSIRT-3
groups were given 45 mg/kg minocycline via an intraperitoneal
injection at 1 h prior to reducing the pressure. The

groups that did not receive drugs received an intraperitoneal
injection of saline of the same volume at the same
time.
Barrier function assessment of HBMECs
Barrier function of HBMEC monolayers was assessed by
real-time measurement of TEER by Electric Cell-
Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS Model 1600R,
Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY, USA). Experiments were
performed using HBMEC monolayers grown on rat tail
collagen-coated transwell (0.4lM, Millipore) (Engelhardt
et al., 2014a). All measurements were normalized to the
0-h time point of the corresponding treatment and the
number of replicates per experiment was six independently
(n= 6).
Evans Blue
The BBB permeability was evaluated using Evans
Blue staining as previously described with minor
modifications (Ma et al., 2011). In brief, Evans Blue staining
was conducted in the hypobaric chamber when the
animals were exposed to a simulation of 8000 m for
24 h and the barometer was down-regulated to a simulation
of 5000 m. Once the elevation reached 5000 m, rats
were immediately anesthetized and given 2% Evans
Blue solution (8 mL/kg, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) by direct
injection into the femoral vein. After 1-h circulation, rats
were perfused under deep anesthesia with cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) until the outflow
was clear. Then the brain was removed and the cortex of
the brain was stored at80C until use. For detecting the
Evans Blue leakage, brain tissues were homogenized in
99% dimethylformamide, and samples were incubated
at 50C water bath for 48 h. After 30 min of centrifuging
(12,000g) at 4 C, the supernatant was collected and
the absorbance of the sample was measured at 620 nm
using a spectrophotometer.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis
Animals were anesthetized when the elevation of
hypobaric chamber was reduced to 5000 m and 2%
Evans Blue solution was given as described above. Ten
minutes following Evans Blue injection, animals were
given 3 mL/kg colloidal gold nanoparticles (30 nm
diameter, Shengtaier, Chengdu, China). Fifty minutes
later, rats were perfused with PBS solution and tissues
were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde. For TEM
analysis, brain tissues were removed and fixed with 2%
glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for
15 min. Tissues stained with Evans Blue were minced
into 1-mm1-mm1-mm size pieces, and fixed with
2% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA mixture at 4C
overnight. After dehydration, samples were impregnated
with epoxy resin and sectioned. Sections were double
stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Images
were obtained under an H-7100 TEM (Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan). Each experimental group was observed in 24
fields.
Western blotting
Total protein was extracted from HBMECs after exposure
to hypoxia (1% O
2
) for 24 h, and brain cortex tissues of
rats after exposure to 8000 m for 24 h, and the protein
concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) protein assay. Protein samples were taken
from cell culture clusters, or six rats in each group. The
proteins were probed with primary antibodies: Anti-HIF-
1a (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz), anti-MMP-9 (1:1000
dilution, Abcam), anti-MMP-2 (1:1000 dilution, Abcam),
anti-Cluadin5 (1:1000 dilution, Abcam), anti-Occludin
(1:1000 dilution, Abcam), anti-ZO1 (1:500 dilution,
Abcam), anti-VEGF (1:500 dilution, Abcam), anti-SIRT-3
(1:500 dilution, Abcam), anti-PHD-2 (1:500 dilution,
Abcam) and anti-b-actin (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz).
The immunobands were visualized using
Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kits according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences,
Arlington Heights, IL, USA). The expression bands of
target proteins were analyzed by a bioimaging
system (Model 4000, Bio-Rad, Versa Doc) and the
densitometric values were analyzed by Image J
software. The housekeeping protein b-actin was used
as internal control.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Twenty-four hours following hypoxia (1% O
2
), the total
RNA was extracted from HBMECs. Total RNA was
reverse transcribed using SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen),
and qRT-PCR was performed using a PCR instrument
(MJ Research, Opticon CFD-3200). PCR amplification
was carried out using specific primers: HIF-1a, forward,
50-ACAAGTCACCACAGGACAG-30, reverse, 50-AGGGA
GAAAATCAAGTCG-30; MMP-9, forward, 50-TGGCTCA
GAACAACAAGTTCAAC-30, reverse, 50-GGCAGTTCCA
GATGTCGTACT-30; MMP-2, forward, 50-TGATGGATGC
TTCCAAACTG-30, reverse, 50-GAGCATTGGAAGTTGG
GGTA-30; b-actin was used as an internal control, and
the relative expression from amplified RNA samples
was calculated using the 2-DDCT method.
Luciferase reporter assay
In order to study the transcriptional level of VEGF, cells
were co-transfected by using the Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.8lg of the VEGF luciferase
reporter construct (pro-VEGF) together with 0.8lg of 
pro-HIF-1a. Both constructs were kindly provided by Dr.
Chen De-Wei (the Third Military Medical University,
Chongqing, China). After a 24-h transfection, cells were
exposed to hypoxia for different time intervals and
extracts were harvested. The number of replicates per
experiment was six independently (n= 6), Luciferase
activity was measured using the reporter assay system
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Immunocytochemistry
After 24 h of hypoxia (1% O
2
), the cells were fixed in 4%
PFA, washed by PBS (0.1 M) and then incubated with an
252 F. Yang et al./Neuroscience 304 (2015) 250–259
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1710781208)
anti-HIF-1a antibody (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz) at 4C
overnight. After washing, samples were probed with
secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West
Grove, PA, USA). Micrographs were randomly selected
and captured under a fluorescent microscope and were
analyzed by MagnaFire SP 2.1B (Olympus, Melville,
NY, USA) software.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by SPSS13.0 software and
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A oneway
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures was used to estimate the significance of
TEER at different times. Multiple comparisons for other
data were statistically analyzed with ANOVA followed by
Student Newman-Keuls test. Results were statistically
significant at P< 0.05.
RESULTS
Minocycline preserved BBB integrity under hypoxia
in vitro and in vivo
To examine the effect of minocycline on brain edema
following hypoxia, HBMECs cell monolayer and rats
were exposed to a hypoxia environment after the
administration of minocycline. In HBMECs cell
monolayer, low oxygen reduced TEER reflecting higher
cell permeability, in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, we noted a significant decrease in
electrical resistance at 24 h, but when minocycline
(10lM) was administrated, the TEER enhanced to
35.3% compared to the control (1% O
2
) ( P< 0.05,
Fig. 1B). There was a same trend with given YC-1 (a
HIF-1a inhibitor) to induce TEER (P< 0.05, Fig. 1B).
Conversely, DMOG, a stabilizer of HIF-1a, reduced
TEER even in the presence of minocycline (Fig. 1B). In
hypoxia rats, minocycline (45 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg)
reduced Evans Blue permeability (P< 0.05, Fig. 1C).
Similar results were obtained with colloidal gold
nanoparticles as tracers. Hypoxia increased the
accumulation of gold nanoparticles surrounding blood
vessels of the brain cortex in hypoxic rats and barely
any gold nanoparticles were found in the rats treated
with 45 mg/kg minocycline (Fig. 2).
Minocycline inhibited HIF-1a protein expression and
translocation to the nucleus, but not mRNA
expression in hypoxia in vitro
To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of
minocycline to BBB in hypoxia, we investigated the
effect of minocycline on the HIF-1a pathway in
HBMECs cell monolayer. Minocycline (10lM and
20lM) significantly inhibited HIF-1a protein expression
compared to the control at 24 h following hypoxia
(P< 0.05, Fig. 3A and F). Similarly, minocycline also
inhibited the expression of MMP-9 (P< 0.05, Fig. 3B
and G), and MMP-2 (P< 0.05, Fig. 3C and H). The
expression of VEGF after hypoxia was also reduced by
minocycline (both dimer and monomer, P< 0.05,
Fig. 3D, I and J). On the contrary, the protein
expressions of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5
constituting the tight junction proteins (TJs) between
endothelial cells were increased by minocycline
(P< 0.05, Fig. 3K, M and L). As a positive control, YC-
1 had similar effects with minocycline, but DMOG could
reverse minocycline-induced decrease of HIF-1a
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, minocycline could not inhibit HIF-
1a mRNA expression (Fig. 4A), but could hinder
translocation of HIF-1a into the nucleus under hypoxia
condition (Fig. 4E). In addition, minocycline significantly
inhibited MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA expression in
hypoxia (P< 0.05, Fig. 4B and C), and suppressed
VEGF reporter transactivation activity in HIF-1a
overexpressing cells in normoxic condition (to mimic
post-hypoxia status) (P< 0.05, Fig. 4D). All these

results suggest that minocycline inhibits HIF-1a protein
and its translocation, but not mRNA.
SIRT-3 siRNA injection knocked down SIRT-3 protein
and increased HIF-1a in hypoxia rats
Next, we examined the mechanism whereby minocycline
regulates HIF-1a, and protects BBB using siRNA-
mediated knockdown of SIRT-3. Western blot analysis
showed that hypoxia alone inhibited the expression of
SIRT-3, while minocycline significantly augmented the
expression of SIRT-3 under hypoxic conditions.
Importantly, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of
SIRT-3 siRNA for 2 days, reversed the minocyclineinduced
increase of SIRT-3 by 71.4% as compared to
the rats treated with siRNA-control or siRNA-GAPDH,
confirming successful knockdown of SIRT-3 (P< 0.05,
Fig. 5A and 5G). As expected, minocycline reduced
HIF-1a expression under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, knockdown of SIRT-3 reversed minocyclineinduced
reduction of HIF-1a as compared to the rats
treated with siRNA-control or siRNA-GAPDH (P< 0.05,
Fig. 5B and I). Critical to HIF-1a signaling are post
translational regulations including oxygen-dependent
hydroxylation by Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHDs) and
mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT-3.
Under hypoxic conditions, the activities of PHD and
SIRT-3 are inhibited (Greer et al., 2012), thereby allowing
HIF-1a to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus,
where it binds to the hypoxia-responsive element
sequences of target gene promoters, such as VEGF,
MMP-2 and MMP-9 (P< 0.05, Fig. 5D–F). Thus,
promotion of PHD activity destabilizes HIF-1a and other
proteins thus acting as a protection for BBB. Consistent
with the role of PHD, we found that the PHD-2 expression
was significantly increased after intraperitoneal injection
of minocycline (45 mg/kg) under hypoxia as compared
to hypoxic rats without treatment. Importantly, the
increased effect of minocycline on PHD-2 was completely
reversed by siRNA knockdown of SIRT-3 as compared to
the rats treated with siRNA-control or siRNA-GAPDH
(P< 0.05,Fig. 5C and G). In addition, the protein expression
of Zo-1, Occludin and claudin-5 have similar trends
with PHD-2 (P< 0.05, Fig. 6A). Knockdown of SIRT-3
did not affect animal’s locomotor activities or other visible
activities (data not shown). These data demonstrate that
minocycline increases PHD-2 and SIRT-3 and decreases
HIF-1a protein expression under hypoxia. Minocycline
effects were largely reversed by siRNA knockdown of
SIRT-3, supporting the view that SIRT-3 mediated the
minocycline effect under hypoxia condition (P< 0.05,
Fig. 5).
SIRT-3 siRNA injection broke the effect of
minocycline and increased the permeability of the
BBB in rats under hypoxia
Lastly, we examined the effect of knockdown of
SIRT-3 on the minocycline-mediated control of BBB
permeability in rats under hypoxic conditions. As
expected, minocycline exerted a protective effect
against hypoxia-induced BBB damage. Importantly,
siRNA knockdown of SIRT-3 reversed the protective
effect of minocycline and increased BBB permeability as
compared to the rats treated with siRNA-control
(P< 0.05, Fig. 6E). Taken together, these data suggest
that SIRT-3 mediates the protection of minocycline on
BBB under hypoxic condition.
DISCUSSION
In this study we have demonstrated that minocycline
regulates BBB disruption and decreases brain edema
through HIF-1a process with the involvement of
Fig. 2. Representative transmission electron microscope photographs show the deposition of colloidal gold nanoparticles around cerebral vessels

SIRT-3/PHD-2 pathway in severe hypoxia. Previous
studies have demonstrated a neuro-protective effect of
minocycline in several brain injury models by its antiinflammatory
properties (Buller et al., 2009; Zhao et al.,
2011). Our study shows that minocycline protects BBB
by regulating the stability and activity of HIF-1a, and this
protection can be dramatically reversed by siRNA knockdown
of SIRT-3 along with HIF-1a decrease and PHD-2
increase. These data provide a mechanism wherein
minocycline acts as a chemical substance protecting
hypoxic vascular endothelial cells by regulating HIF-1a
signaling and its downstream target genes.
Our data indicate that hypoxia can increase the BBB
permeability and minocycline can preserve BBB which is
associated with HIF-1a. Under normoxia, the HIF-1a
is constitutively transcribed but constantly targeted
for proteasomal degradation through a cascade of
hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in HIF-1a
via PHDs, subsequently recognized by the VHL
protein, ubiquitination and degradation by the
proteasome. But in a hypoxic condition, the PHD
enzymes are inhibited, thus resulting in cytoplasmic
stabilization of HIF-1a and translocation to the nucleus
(Greer et al., 2012; Palazon et al., 2014). Minocycline
inhibits HIF-1a which is an important reason for high
vascular permeability because of its strong ability to transcribe
and express high vascular permeability molecules
such as VEGF and MMPs (Ogunshola and Al-Ahmad,
2012; Engelhardt et al., 2014b), and those molecules
can impair endothelial cells and TJs (Occludin,
Cluadin-5, and ZO-1) between them. Minocycline also
be deemed to an inhibitor of MMP-9 and alleviated the
disruption of BBB after traumatic brain injury
(Higashida et al., 2011). Those results imply minocycline
protected BBB in pathologic conditions which is concerned
with the HIF-1a pathway.
We further investigated how minocycline inhibits HIF-
1a. It has been reported that minocycline suppresses

HIF-1a through increasing the expression of PHD-2(Li
et al., 2014a). Our results also showed that in HBMECs,
minocycline inhibited nuclear translocation of HIF-1a
and transcriptional activity, which is associated with an
increment of PHD-2. PHD-2 is considered to be the key
oxygen sensor, as knockdown of PHD-2 results in elevated
HIF protein (Chan and Giaccia, 2010). Our findings
were consistent with the previous works showing that
minocycline functions as a suppressor of HIF-1a through
the regulation of PHD-2 (Li et al., 2014a). Kang et al. (Li
et al., 2014a) found that minocycline elevates the expression
of PHD-2 and the interaction of HIF-1a with von
Hippel–Lindau (VHL) protein in human lung adenocarcinoma
cell lines under hypoxia.
However, PHD-2 is regulated by a variety of
mechanisms. One of them is through SIRT-3. SIRT-3
is a member of seven-member sirtuin family, as a
tumor suppressor (Schumacker, 2011; Greer et al.,
2012). Previous studies have shown that SIRT-3 controls
cancer metabolic reprogramming by regulating
PHD-2 and HIFs (Schumacker, 2011), which is apparently
related to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).
Hypoxia causes mitochondria and cytoplasm to produce
a large amount of ROS which may recruit SIRT-3 to control
PHD-2 (Schumacker, 2011; Greer et al., 2012). Our
study found that PHD-2 expression decreases after
inhibiting SIRT-3, suggesting that SIRT-3 plays a key
role in the regulation of PHD-2. We postulated and
tested the hypothesis that minocycline decreases the
permeability of BBB and increases PHD-2 by altering
SIRT-3 using siRNA to knock down SIRT-3. Indeed,
minocycline elevated SIRT-3, PHD-2 and destabilized
HIF-1a and decreased Evans Blue permeability in
hypoxia rats. Eventually SIRT-3/PHD-2/HIF-1a pathway
and the TJs damage may be associated with MMPs
which mediate hypoxia-induced vascular leakage in the
brain via gap formation of TJs. Importantly, after siRNA
knockdown of SIRT-3, the minocycline-mediated
increase of PHD-2 and decrease of Evans Blue permeability
in the hypoxia rats were reversed. These data
prompted us to propose that minocycline participates in
activating PHD-2, degrading HIF-1a and protecting
BBB by acting on SIRT-3.
Recent studies have shed light on the mechanism
through which SIRT-3 regulates cellular ROS and
HIF-1a. Murine tumors lacking SIRT-3 exhibit
abnormally high levels of ROS that directly increase
HIF-1a protein levels (Haigis et al., 2012). This result
is in agreement with our finding that SIRT-3 can
directly or indirectly inhibit HIF-1a and protect BBB
under hypoxia. SIRT-3 loss increases ROS production,
leading to HIF-1a stabilization in tumor cells
(Schumacker, 2010; Finley and Haigis, 2012). In our
study, we found that minocycline significantly increased
SIRT-3, although ROS was not measured. We speculate
that minocycline may directly suppress ROS generation
, leading to an increase of PHD-2 and
enhancement of HIF-1 degradation and preservation
of the integrity of BBB.
Our studies reveal the profound impact of minocycline
on hypoxic brain edema. In moderate to severe AMS, all
imaging studies have shown some degree of cerebral
edema (Imray et al., 2010). In fewer susceptible persons,
acute hypoxia leads to a high blood vessel permeability
Fig. 4. Minocycline inhibited HIF-1a translocation to the nucleus, but did not inhibit its mRNA expression in hypoxia in vitro. After separately
delivering 5lM minocycline, 10lM minocycline, 20lM minocycline, 10lM YC-1, and 1 mM DMOG, HMEC monolayers were placed in a hypoxic
device immediately, then the mRNA levels of HIF-1a (A), MMP-9 (B) and MMP-2 (C) were detected at 24 h. Transcriptional level of HIF-1a was
measured by Luciferase reporter assay at 8 h under normoxia (D). HIF-1aimmunocytochemistry (E).n= 6, Error bars represent standard deviation

and brain edema known as high-altitude coma (Hackett
and Roach, 2004; Basnyat, 2005). HIF-1a may help the
immigrated people acclimatize to high altitudes through
increasing erythropoietin (EPO) production and tissue
oxygen supply (Benderro et al., 2013; Tsui et al., 2014).
Actually, inhibition of HIF-1a within a short time may be
an effective way to deal with brain edema induced by severe
hypoxia. Recent research has reported that inhibition
of HIF-1aby YC-1 and dimethyl estradiol can reduce BBB
permeability after ischemic-hypoxic injury (Yeh et al.,
2007). Recently minocycline is also believed to function
as a HIF-1a inhibitor in lung cancer cells (Jung et al.,
2014). It is worth noting that other mechanisms are likely
to participate in the effect of minocycline on BBB integrity
during hypoxia because minocycline induced much
greater inhibition results than YC-1 in some ways.
In this study, we took advantage of minocycline to
inhibit HIF-1a based on its capability to pass through
BBB. We found that minocycline could reduce BBB
permeability caused by hypoxia and HIF-1a,
simultaneously both in vivo and in vitro. This raises a
possibility for targeting HIF-1a as a therapeutic
strategy for treating brain edema. Whether minocycline
alleviates AMS and HACE needs more on-site
verification on plateau. It will also be important for
future work to examine the impact of minocycline on
inflammation and mitochondrial oxidative stress under
hypoxia.
