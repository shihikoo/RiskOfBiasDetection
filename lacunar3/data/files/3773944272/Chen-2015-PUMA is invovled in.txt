Abstract—PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis),
a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is
required for p53-dependent and p53-independent forms of
apoptosis. PUMA has been invovled in the onset and progress
of several diseases, including cancer, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome, and ischemic brain disease.
Although many studies have shown that ischemia and
reperfusion (I/R) can induce the apoptosis of astrocytes,
the role of PUMA in I/R-mediated apoptosis of cerebral
astrocyte apoptosis remains unclear. To mimic in vivo I/R
conditions, primary mouse cerebral astrocytes were incubated
in a combinational cultural condition of oxygen, glucose
, and serum deprivation (OSGD) for 1 h followed by
reperfusion (OSGD/R). Cell death determination assays
and cell viability assays indicated that OSGD and OSGD/
R induce the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes.
The expression of PUMA was significantly elevated in
primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD/R. Moreover,
targeted down-regulation of PUMA by siRNA transfection
significantly decreased the OSGD/R-induced apoptosis of
primary cerebral astrocytes. We also found that OSGD
and OSGD/R triggered the release of cytochrome c in
astrocytes, indicating the dependence on a mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was
extremely generated during OSGD and OSGD/R, and the
elimination of ROS by treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) remarkably inhibited the expression of PUMA and
the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. The activation
of Caspase 3 and Caspase 9 was extremely elevated
in primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD. In addition,
we found that knockdown of PUMA led to the depressed
expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 during
OSGD/R. These results indicate that PUMA is invovled
in the apoptosis of cerebral astrocytes upon I/R injury.

INTRODUCTION
Ischemia is the most common cause of cell damage in the
brain (Bu et al., 2014; de la Rosa et al., 2014). It can occur
during ischemic strokes, trauma, or atherosclerosis. Injury
due to ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) has been found in
multifarious cases, including myocardial injury, catagma,
and neurological deficit. Although the precise mechanism
regulating I/R-induced cerebral neural cell death is not
certain, some studies showed that astrocytes play an
important role in protecting neurons during I/R in the
central nervous system. Astrocytes are the most
abundant type of glial cell in the mammalian brain, which
perform many functions in protecting neurons during
stress (Sakurai et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2001; Watts
et al., 2005).
The incremental evidence indicates that I/R can induce
astrocytes apoptosis (DeGracia and Montie, 2004), which
includes both a receptor-dependent extrinsic pathway
(Sakurai et al., 1998) and a mitochondria-associated
intrinsic pathway (Springer et al., 1999). Mitochondriamediated
apoptosis plays an important role in the antitumor
activities of a wide variety of conventional chemotherapeutic
agents as well as targeted therapies (Servida
et al., 2011). The Bcl-2 family of proteins are the central
regulators of mitochondria mediated apoptosis, which is
engaged by the selective activation or induction of the
proximal BH3-only members in response to distinct as well
as overlapping signals (Gomez-Bougie et al., 2005).
PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) was
discovered as a p53-induced BH3-only protein, and also
can be induced in a p53-independent manner (Nakano
and Vousden, 2001; Jeffers et al., 2003). PUMA activates
the mitochondrial pathway via the Bcl-2 family member
Bax/Bak following neutralizing all members of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 like molecules (Kim et al., 2009; Ren et al.,
2010). In the present study, we examine whether I/R
induces the apoptosis of mouse cerebral astrocytes, more
importantly, whether or not the PUMA pathway and Caspase
pathways are activated in cerebral astrocytes during
I/R.

Care and Use Committee (Permit No. 2012100801). Four
male and eleven female adult mice were maintained in a
virus-free facility at the animal housing facility at Nanjing
General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command. These
female mice were mated with male mice and were
checked for pregnancy. Sixteen newborn C57BL/6 mice
(one-day-old) were used in this study.
Highly enriched astroglial primary cultures were
prepared as previously described (Dugan et al., 1995).
In brief, the head of newborn C57BL/6 mouse was rapidly
cut by a scissor. Forebrain cortices of newborn mice pups
were dissected. Then we carefully removed the meninges
and pia mater. The tissue was trypsinized, mechanically
cut into pieces by scissors, and seeded in tissue culture
dishes. These materials were grown in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO
2
at 37C in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, penicillin
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100lg/mL). The culture
medium was changed every 3 days. When the cells
reached 80–90% confluence after 12–14 days, the cells
were dissociated using trypsin–EDTA (Hyclone), centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and replated. The purity of
astrocytes was determined by immunocytochemical
staining with an astrocytic marker GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein).
Oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OSGD)
treatment
To mimic endogenous (I/R), the culture media were
removed and primary astrocytes were washed two times
with D-hank’s on the day of the experiment. Primary
astrocytes were exposed to hypoxic conditions (5% CO
2
and 95% N
2
) in the absence of serum and glucose with
the treatment of glucose-free DMEM for 1 h, followed by
restoration. The cultures of primary astrocytes were
taken out from the anaerobic chamber, followed by
adding glucose and serum and the cultures were
incubated under normal growth conditions for different
times.
MTT assay for cell viability
Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
Primary astrocytes were seeded in 96-well plates at
1104cells per well and incubated overnight at 37C
before being subjected to various treatments. Following
treatment, MTT was added to each well and the cells
were further incubated for 4 h at 37C. The absorbance
at 540 nm was determined using a Varioskan plate
reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan).
Each assay was performed in triplicate with three
independent replicates.
Cell death determination
To quantify apoptotic astrocytes, cell death determination
assay was performed. Primary astrocytes treated
with indicated drugs were fixed for 1 h in 4%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Thenafter, cells
were washed three times with PBS and stained with
5lg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37C in 
the dark. The morphological features of apoptosis
were observed by fluorescence microscopy. At least
100 cells from 10 randomly selected fields per dish
were counted.
Western blotting
Astrocytic cells were harvested and washed twice in cold
PBS, subsequently, solubilized in lysis buffer (Tris,
50 mmol/L, pH 7.5; Triton X-100, 10 g/L; Na
deoxycholate, 10 g/L; SDS, 0.1 g/L; NaCl, 150 mmol/L;
EDTA, 0.05 mmol/L; Sodium Fluoride, 50 mmol/L; Na
pyrophosphate, 10 mmol/L; NaVO
4
, 0.5 mmol/L; PMSF,
1 mmol/L supplemented with a mixture of protease
inhibitors). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation
for 20 min at 12,000g at 4C. The protein
concentrations were quantified by a BCA protein assay
kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Equal
amounts of protein from each sample were separated
by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to PMSF
membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5%
nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h, and then incubated with
the primary antibodies for 3–4 h at room temperature.
Individual blots were probed with anti-PUMA, anticytochrome
c, anti-caspase 3, anti-caspase 9, anti-Bax,
anti-b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), anti-PERK, anti-phospho-PERK, anti-Flag (Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-MLKL
(Sigma). The membranes were washed with TBST for
3 times and then incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated
goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG for 2 h.
According to the manufacturer’s protocol, the antigen–
antibody complexes were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Routinely, protein load was monitored using
immunodetection of b-actin.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
For gene knockdown, siRNA duplexes specific for
human PUMA (Plus: 50-GAAUGCCAGUGGUCACACG-30
and 50-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-30; GenePharma,
Shanghai, China) were transfected into astrocytes by
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) in serum-free OPTI-MEM according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Knockdown efficiency was
estimated 48 h after transfection by measuring protein
levels in cell lysates through using Western blotting.
Plasmids and transiently transfection
The Flag-PUMA plasmid was purchased from Addgene
(USA). Astrocytes were seeded in 6-well plates
(Costar, Corning, NY, USA) and cultured to 60–70%
confluence, and then transiently transfected with
plasmids by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen) in serum-free OPTI-MEM according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation
ROS was measured with the non-fiuorescent probe 2,
7-dichlorofiuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma).
DCFH-DA can passively diffuse into cells and be
deacetylated by esterase to form non-fiuorescent 2,
7-dichlorofiuorescein (DCFH). In the presence of ROS,
DCFH reacts with ROS to form the fiuorescent product
DCF, which is trapped inside the cells. The cells were
washed with ice-cold 1PBS and incubated with
DCFH-DA at 37C for 20 min. Then DCF fluorescence
intensity was detected by fluorescence spectrometry
(Spectra MAX GEMINI, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) at excitation wavelength 488 nm and at
emission wavelength 535 nm.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of the experimental data was carried out using
SPSS 19.0 software, and a one-way analysis of
variance and paired t-test were used. Data are
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Differences were considered as statistically significant
if the probability of the difference occurring was
P< 0.05.
RESULTS
(I/R) induces apoptosis of astrocytes
All experiments were performed on primary neonatal
mouse astrocytes from the forebrain. To mimic in vivo
(I/R) conditions, cells were subjected to a combination of
(OGSD) for indicated times and then reperfusion (OGSD/
R). In order to evaluate the effect of I/R on cell apoptotic
status, morphological examinations were performed by
stained with Hoechst 33342. The results show that I/R
had a profound effect on the cell death of astrocytes
(Fig. 1A). The dead cells significantly increased after 1 h
of OGSD alone compared to that of non-treated cells
(Fig. 1A). Moreover, the number of dead cells further
increased when the cells were subjected to 1 h/8 h
OGSD/R (Fig. 1A). To confirm the results from Hoechst

33342 staining assay, cell viability was measured by using
MTT assay. The results are in agreement with that
I/R induces cell death of astrocytes (Fig. 1B). In order to
determine whether I/R induces astrocyte’s necroptosis,
we have analyzed the expression of MLKL in OSGD
condition. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of MLKL
was not altered in primary astrocytes. So, these
experiments demonstrated that I/R induces apoptosis of
astrocytes.
PUMA is required for I/R-induced apoptosis of
astrocytes
Western blotting analysis revealed that PUMA protein
level started to increase after 1 h of OGSD and peaked
at 1 h/8 h OGSD/R (Fig. 2A). To analyze the role of
endogenous PUMA on OGSD/R-induced cell apoptosis,
we knocked down PUMA expression by using siRNA
transfection. Specific siRNA target to PUMA reduced
the protein level of PUMA by approximately 70%, as
assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B) and significantly
reduced OGSD/R-induced cell apoptosis of cerebral
astrocytes (Fig. 2C). Next, we transiently transfected the
wild-type PUMA tagged with Flag into cerebral
astrocytes (Fig. 3A). The over-expression of PUMA was
capable of promoting OGSD-induced or OGSD/R-
induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these
experiments demonstrated that PUMA expression was
required for I/R-induced cell apoptosis of cerebral
astrocytes.
I/R triggers a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
In order to elucidate the mechanism of cell apoptosis of
astrocytes, we have analyzed two different key signaling
involved in apoptosis. A significant increase in
cytochrome c release was obtained after 1 h/4 h OGSD/
R and 1 h/12 h OGSD/R (Fig. 4A). A significant increase
of phosphorylation of protein kinase-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase (p-PERK) was also displayed after 1 h
OGSD. However, there was no change of p-PERK after
reperfusion (Fig. 4B). To analyze the relation between
PERK and PUMA, we transfected siRNA against PUMA
or Flag-PUMA plasmids into astrocytes, and then
investigated the PERK phosphorylation. The knockdown
or over-expression of PUMA was incapable of altering
the phosphorylation of PERK after 1 h/8 h OGSD/R
(Fig. 4C). These finding indicated that I/R triggered a
mitochondrial pathway to induce cell apoptosis of
cerebral astrocytes.
ROS regulates the expression of PUMA in I/R
condition
(ROS) and mitochondria play an important role in
apoptosis induction under both physiologic and
pathologic conditions. We found that there was a
significant increase of intracellular ROS after OSGD and
OSGD/R (Fig. 5A). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS
scavenger, significantly reduced OGSD-induced and
OGSD/R-induced cell apoptosis of astrocytes (Fig. 5B).
Next, we investigated the alteration of PUMA expression
Fig. 2. PUMA is required for I/R-induced apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. (A) Primary cultures of astrocytes were subjected to oxygen,

in the absence of ROS. NAC completely abrogated the
expression of PUMA at 1 h/8 h OSGD/R in primary
astrocytes (Fig. 5C). All of the above results indicate
that I/R-induced cell apoptosis may result from ROS-
dependent PUMA signaling pathway.

were not detected in the control group, and elevated
expression of cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase
9 were reached at 1 h OSGD and then stayed constant
at 1 h/8 h OSGD/R (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, Bax
was also not detectable in primary astrocytes of the
control group. However, we observed an increase in
Bax expression at 1 h/8 h OSGD/R (Fig. 6A).
Knockdown of PUMA led to the depressed expression
of Bax at 1 h/8 h OSGD/R in astrocytes (Fig. 6B). Also,
knockdown of PUMA downregulated the expression of
cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 6B). This finding
suggests that PUMA/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling
pathway may contribute to apoptosis of cerebral
astrocytes induced by (I/R).
In this study, we found that ischemia can induce the
apoptosis of cerebral astrocytes and reperfusion
augmented the cytotoxic effects of ischemia. In addition,
ROS, PUMA, Bax, caspase-9 and caspase-3 are
involved in the apoptosis of cerebral astrocytes induced
by (I/R).

of primary cerebral astrocytes in response to I/R injury.
The discovery of the PUMA gene was successively
reported in 2001 by three different laboratories (Chen
et al., 2001; Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al.,
2001). The PUMA gene can be induced immediately by
p53, and its consequent coded product has a powerful
apoptosis-promoting activity. PUMA has emerged as a
critical regulator of cell apoptosis in cancer (Dey et al.,
2014), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Erlacher
et al., 2006), and ischemic myocardial disease (Wu
et al., 2011). PUMA is normally expressed at a very low
level, and is rapidly induced in response to a wide range
of stimuli in different tissues (Jeffers et al., 2003). Following
transient forebrain ischemia, miR-29a targets BH3-
only proapoptotic BCL2 family member PUMA (Ouyang
et al., 2013). In this study, blocking PUMA signaling by
siRNA transfection completely abolished I/R-induced
apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes, and overexpression
of PUMA increased the same phenotype.
These results indicate that PUMA regulates the apoptosis
of primary cerebral astrocytes in response to ischemia
alone and (I/R).
PUMA can transduce apoptogenic signals to the
mitochondria, where it activates the multi-domain
proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to trigger
mitochondrial dysfunction (Ren et al., 2010). Several mitochondrial
apoptogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c, are
released into the cytosol to initiate apoptosis, and subsequently
format of the apoptosome and activate the caspase
cascade (Bu et al., 2014). Our study found that a
significant increase in cytochrome c release was obtained
after I/R. Mitochondrial apoptosis, as a classical deathsignaling
pathway, has an important role in endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death (Song et al.,
2014). The ER is an elaborate cellular organelle essential
for cell function and survival. If the ER stress is lasted,
apoptotic cell death occurs. Many studies have focused
on how this failure initiates apoptosis, particularly because
ER stress-induced apoptosis is implicated in the pathophysiology
of several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular
diseases (Song et al., 2014). Upon ER stress, PERK
dimerizes to promote its autophosphorylation and activation.
In this study, the activated PERK was elevated after
ischemia alone, but keeping the same phosphorylation
level of PERK after reperfusion. And the knockdown or
over-expression of PUMA was incapable of altering the
phosphorylation of PERK after OGSD/R. These results
indicate that ER stress-induced apoptosis can occur in primary
cerebral astrocytes after ischemia alone, but the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is the major apoptotic factors
after I/R.
Thin-layer chromatography of PUMA from transiently
transfected HeLa cells with constructs encoding
N-terminally HA- or Flag-tagged PUMA indicated that
this protein is phosphorylated on Ser residues in
multiple sites with the major site of modification being
Ser10 (Fricker et al., 2010). Post-transcriptional modification
by phosphorylation at Ser10 promotes protein
turnover, represses PUMA-induced cell death, and promotes
cell survival (Fricker et al., 2010). In our study,
Flag-PUMA transfected cells do not undergo apoptosis
under normoxia conditions. It seems to be the case that
PUMA is phosphorylated and subsequently represses
PUMA-induced apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes
under normoxia conditions.
The relationship between PERK and PUMA has been
reported in several experimental systems. Schisano et al.
found that exposure of HUVECs to high glucose
up-regulated both PERK and proapoptotic PUMA
protein levels (Schisano et al., 2012). FoxO3a knockdown
partially prevented induction of DP5 and PUMA by palmitate
, showing that the AKT-FoxO3a pathway downstream
of ER stress controls PUMA gene expression and contributes
to b-cell death (Cunha et al., 2012). Our results
showed that 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (4-HNE) triggered
three canonical pathways of UPR, namely IRE1-
XBP1, PERK-eIF2a-ATF4 and ATF6, and induced the
expression of UPR-targeted genes, GRP78, CHOP,
TRB3, PUMA, and GADD34, as well as Phase II
enzymes, HO-1 and GCLC (Lin et al., 2014). Ursolic acid
treatment disrupted the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein
Puma, and largely abolished heat stress-induced
phosphorylation of PERK, phosphorylation of eIF2a and
CHOP activation in myocardi (Yang et al., 2014). MIRA-
1 treatment results in upregulation of Puma and Bax
and triggers activation of PERK and IRE-a leading to
splicing of XBP1 indicating an association of (ER) stress
response (Saha et al., 2014). The previous reports have
not clearly illuminated the relationship between PERK
and PUMA, which needs further study.
The main endogenous source of ROS is the
mitochondrial electron transport complex. Healthy
mitochondria use oxygen to generate ATP by oxidative
phosphorylation at the mitochondrial respiratory chain,
and as a consequence small levels of the ROS
superoxide are produced in the mitochondrial matrix
(Zhdanov et al., 2014). In ischemia, oxygen becomes
depleted prior to glucose, as shown by the fact that interstitial
oxygen pressure in the penumbra, the brain area
partially irrigated by collateral vessels that surrounds the
acutely injured core, decreases to 33% only 1 h after
ischemia (Liu et al., 2004). Other contributors to ROS in
ischemia are the enzyme xanthine oxidase and mitochondrial
depolarization (Aranda et al., 2007). Here, we found
that there was a significant increase of intracellular ROS
after ischemia alone and I/R. A ROS scavenger (NAC)
treatment significantly reduced OGSD-induced and
OGSD/R-induced cell apoptosis of astrocytes and completely
abrogated the expression of PUMA after I/R in
astrocytes.
Caspase 3 and caspase 9 are a critical executioner of
apoptosis and contributes to programed cell death (Jiang
et al., 2014). Our study showed that caspase 3 and caspase
9 were extremely activated in astrocytes during
ischemia alone, but keeping the same activated level after
reperfusion. The collaboration of these pro-apoptotic gene
products contributes to the disruption of mitochondrial
membrane potential, thereby releasing cytochrome c from
mitochondrial intermembrane space. Then the release of
cytochrome c causes apoptotic protease activating factor
1 (Apaf1) oligomerization, resulting in apoptosome formation.
This complex recruits and activates pro-caspase 9,

which then activates executioner caspase 3 and caspase
7, which is a critical step in p53-dependent pro-apoptotic
pathway (Wang et al., 2012). PUMA is a direct activator
of Bax (Ren et al., 2010). Bax and activated caspase 3
are usual biochemical markers of apoptosis. Surprisingly,
in our study, we observed an increase in Bax expression
after I/R, but cleaved-caspase 3 stayed constant expression
after I/R. In addition, we found that the Bax level
was reduced by 40% after knocking down PUMA, while
the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 were significantly
declined. These results indicate that the novel
signaling except PUMA/Bax signaling pathway may
trigger the cleavage of caspase-9/caspase-3 under the
I/R condition.
In summary, this study demonstrated that (I/R) can
induce the apoptosis of mouse cerebral astrocytes.
Moreover, our study suggests activation of PUMA/Bax/
caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway and ROS, indicating
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the apoptosis of
cerebral astrocytes induced by (I/R). These results
indicate that PUMA pathway may be a potentially
therapeutic target for I/R-induced cerebral astrocyte
apoptosis.
