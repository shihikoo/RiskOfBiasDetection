Direct Thrombus Imaging as a Means to Control the
Variability of Mouse Embolic Infarct Models

Background and Purpose—High experimental variability in mouse embolic stroke models could mask the effects of
experimental treatments. We hypothesized that imaging thrombus directly would allow this variability to be controlled.
Methods—We optically labeled thrombi with a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe C15 that is covalently linked to
fibrin by factor-XIIIa. Labeled thrombus was injected into the left distal internal carotid artery (ICA) of C57/BL6 mice
(n47), near its bifurcation, and laser-Doppler cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) was assessed for 30 minutes. NIRF thrombus
imaging was done ex vivo at 24 hours.
Results—CBF variably decreased to 43.917.3% at 5 minutes (rCBF; 11.280.4%). NIRF thrombus imaging at 24 hours
showed variability in distribution (ICA bifurcation, adjacent and/or remote areas) and burden (22791270 pixels;
05940 pixels). Final infarct size was also variable (21.010.3%; 4.760.3% of the bihemispheric volume). Despite
this heterogeneity, a strong thrombus-infarct correlation was maintained. The left hemispheric target infarct size (% of
the hemisphere) correlated with thrombus burden, as a stronger predictor of infarct volume (P0.001, r0.50) than
rCBF (P0.02, r0.34). The infarct size was best predicted by a combination of thrombus imaging and CBF:
left-hemispheric big-thrombi (1865 pixels)/low-rCBF (42%) had an infarct volume of 56.910.4% (n12),
big-thrombi/high-rCBF had 45.923.5% (n11), small-thrombi/low-rCBF 35.717.3% (n11) and small-thrombi/
high-rCBF 27.316.4% (n12).
Conclusions—This is the first study to demonstrate that the highly heterogeneous nature of the mouse embolic stroke
model can be characterized and managed by using near-infrared fluorescent thrombus imaging combined with CBF
monitoring to stratify animals into useful subgroups. (Stroke. 2011;42:3566-3573.)

Ischemic stroke caused by cerebral thromboembolism is a
leading cause of death and disability. Much effort has been
put into developing effective neuroprotective treatments, but
with limited success.1,2 A major difficulty in stroke research
has been experimental variability in animal stroke models,3–5
leading to failures in identifying neuroprotective drugs. Embolic
stroke models, in which preformed clots are injected into the
middle cerebral artery–anterior cerebral artery (MCA–ACA)
bifurcation area, mimic human stroke more closely than do other
models of cerebral ischemia.6–9 However, they provide less
control over the location and extent of the resulting cerebral
infarction.3 Factors, such as spontaneous lysis8 or distal embolization
of thrombi after injection into the MCA, as well as
anatomic variations in the circle of Willis, could have major and
variable impacts on the resulting infarct.10 This variability could
mask and confound the potential therapeutic effects3 of neuroprotective
drugs, and by adding to experimental noise, might
mask or heighten the effects of experimental treatments, leading
to hard-to-interpret data.
What is needed is an imaging methodology that would
allow the visualization of thrombi11–14 and their characterization
after injection into the cerebral vasculature; this would
control for at least some of the experimental variability
related to clot lysis, migration, and fragmentation.
To address this issue, we labeled thrombi optically with a
molecular imaging thrombus marker—a 15-amino acid pep-

tide that is known to be recognized by activated coagulation
factor XIII (FXIIIa)15 and labeled on the  amino groups of
lysine residues12,14 with Cy5.5 fluorescent dye (C15). This
probe is covalently linked to the fibrin strands of the clot by
the enzymatic action of FXIIIa, when it crosslinks fibrin
strands during the process of clot maturation.15,16
When inducing embolic strokes in mice, researchers monitor
the decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the MCA
with a laser-Doppler flowmeter. We hypothesized that not
only CBF decrease,17 but also thrombus location and status,
would affect the induced infarct territory or size, which is one
of the most important outcomes in stroke research. To
characterize the heterogeneity of embolic cerebral infarction
and predict the final infarct size at 24 hours, we devised a
technique of ex vivo near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging
to measure the distribution and extent of the cerebral
thromboemboli remaining at 24 hours; this was combined
with in vivo laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to monitor the
CBF for the initial 30 minutes after embolic MCA occlusion.
We also tried to demonstrate potential usefulness of quantitative
visualization of thromboemboli in vascular research.
Methods
Synthesis of the C15 Near-Infrared Fluorescent
Thrombus Marker
C15 NIRF imaging probes were synthesized as previously reported14 with some modifications; specifically, we used Cy5.5
fluorophores instead of Alexa Fluor 680 (Supplemental Methods,
http://stroke.ahajournals.org).
Thrombi Preparation
Thrombi were prepared as previously reported6,7,9 using C15 NIRF
imaging agent or control Cy5.5 fluorochromes as optical markers.
Briefly, 1000L of blood was drawn from C57/BL6 mice. Based on
the results of pilot experiments, whole blood (70 L) was mixed
with the C15 probe (20 mol/L, 30 L) or equal concentration of
control fluorochromes, and drawn up into a 30 cm-long polyethylene
tubes using a 3 mL syringe. The tubes were stored at room
temperature for 2 hours, then at 4°C for 22 hours. Then thrombi were
gently removed from the tubes and washed 3 times with phosphatebuffered
saline.
Animal Experiments
Embolic stroke was induced as previously reported,6,7,9 with some
modifications by injecting the C15-labeled clot (diameter, 0.15 mm;
length, 15 mm) into the MCA–ACA bifurcation area of 10-week-old
C57/BL6 mice (n56; Supplemental Methods). Instead of 10 mm
thrombus,9 we injected 15 mm thrombus after considering that the
thrombus was diluted 7:3 during the labeling process.
Twenty-four hours later, the animals were euthanized, and the
brains were removed and imaged ex vivo using a NIRF imaging
machine11,12,18(Supplemental Methods). Fresh frozen sections of the
brains were used for NIRF microscopic imaging (10-m-thick
sections) or immediate triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining (2-
mm-thick sections) to delineate the infarct area, whereas some
specimens were paraffin-embedded for histology. Nine mice were
excluded because of gross intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage
(n6), imaging failure (n2), or poor data quality (n1).
Quantitative Lesional Topography Analyses
To assess quantitatively the extent and distribution of thromboemboli
and ischemic brain injury, Cy5.5 signals on the NIRF images
and whitish infarct areas on the triphenyl tetrazolium chloridestained
sections were mapped on templates using a custom-built
software package11 (Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Figure
S1). Based on the values of rCBF (% CBF relative to the baseline
value) and/or thrombus extent (pixel numbers), various subgroup–
maps were prepared.
Computer-Simulated Virtual
Neuroprotection Research
To quantify the potential benefits of NIRF thrombus imaging and
rCBF monitoring, we performed computer simulations (Supplemental
Methods). Five sets of selected animals from the study cohort
were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control
group, and statistical comparisons were performed between the
groups after either decreasing the measured infarct size according to
the indicated neuroprotection rate (0–100% at 21 steps) or not.
Statistical Methods
Data are presented as meanSD. Comparisons of continuous variables
between groups were performed using the Student t test or
Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test. In addition, Pearson correlation and
multivariable regression analysis were performed. All statistical
analyses were conducted using a software package (SPSS 18.0). A
probability value0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
NIRF Imaging Allows an Assessment of Cerebral
Thrombus Burden
NIRF macroscopic (Figure 1A) and microscopic (Figure 1B)
imaging confirmed specificity of the C15 probe for the
thrombi, with C15 remaining tightly clot-associated; whereas
free Cy5.5 dye washed away, consistent with covalent linkage
of C15 to clot fibrin strands. As shown in Figure 1C,
visual inspection with regular white light did not allow either
cerebral infarction or cerebral thrombi to be shown. However,
Cy5.5 NIRF tissue imaging showed scattered bright signal
foci bilaterally over the expected locations of the cerebral
arteries of the anterior part of the circle of Willis, mainly in
the left MCA–ACA bifurcation area, but also contralaterally.
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel tissue imaging
showed infarct-related, auto-fluorescent signal in both hemispheres
, more on the left ipsilateral to the clot, but clearly also
contralaterally. Cy5.5 and FITC imaging of serial sections of
the brain showed thrombi and infarct-related auto-fluorescence
in the same vascular bed/territory. The Cy5.5 signals
and FITC auto-fluorescent areas corresponded to the thrombi
and infarcts on histology, respectively.
Both Thrombi and Infarcts Are
Heterogeneously Distributed
Accumulation maps of thrombus and infarct locations
showed the highly heterogeneous nature of the embolic stroke
model (Figure 2A and Supplemental Results). The amount of
thrombus-associated fluorescent signal was highly variable,
ranging from 0 to 5940 pixels (22791270 pixels). Fluorescent
thrombi signal was observed mostly in the left MCA–
ACA bifurcation area. However, scattered emboli were frequently
observed not only in the bifurcation area, but also in
the adjacent or remote cerebral arteries. Approximately one
third of the animals had emboli visualized in the contralateral
right anterior circulation territory, more often in the ACAs
than in the MCAs (Supplemental Results). This contralateral
distribution of embolic clot is likely caused by the closer
proximity of the contralateral ACA territory through vascular
anastomoses through the circle of Willis compared with the

MCA; moreover, there are some variations,19 such as both
ACAs arising from the side of the clot injection, making the
ACA territory particularly vulnerable.
Total infarct size (%-infarct-area relative to the total
bihemispheric area of 6 brain template slices) was also
variable, ranging from 4.7 to 60.3% (21.010.3%). The
accumulation infarct maps showed that infarcts were mainly
located in the left MCA territory, particularly on template
slices2 through5, including the sensorimotor cortex and
basal ganglia. However, scattered infarcts were frequently
observed not only in the left MCA territory, but also in the
adjacent or remote areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere or
contralateral hemisphere.
Despite the Heterogeneity of Thrombus and
Infarct Distributions, a Strong Thrombus–Infarct
Correlation Is Maintained
Between the subgroups with (Figure 2B; n31) and without
(Figure 2B*; n16) emboli visualized in the right MCA–
ACA bifurcation area, infarct size and distribution showed
significant differences: bigger right hemispheric infarcts (%

) and smaller left hemispheric infarcts (template
slices 2–5: 32.516.2% versus 45.220.8%; P0.04) in the
former than in the latter. In template slices 2 to 5, right

macroscopic A microscopic imaging B confirms the specific and tight association of the C15 probe with the thrombus. In A, the control
thrombus with loosely associated free Cy5.5 dye does not retain the fluorescent stain after washing, but the thrombus treated with the
C15 probe does retain the fluorescent signal because of the covalent linkage of the probe to the clot as demonstrated by macroscopic
imaging. In B, the same finding is demonstrated but using microscopic imaging. A representative imaging-histology colocalization study
shows that NIRF imaging visualizes not only the main body of thrombus in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA)—anterior cerebral
artery (ACA) bifurcation (red arrowheads in C and D) but also scattered thromboemboli bilaterally in the adjacent or remote cerebral
arteries, predominantly of the anterior part of the circle of Willis, 24 hours after preformed labeled clots were injected. A magnified view
(inlet) of a cut section through the site of Cy5.5 signal in the MCA—ACA bifurcation (red arrowheads in C and D) reveals thrombi filling
the bifurcating cerebral arteries (left), which is confirmed by the corresponding fluorescence microscopy image (right). In the ex vivo
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel C, bright auto-fluorescent signal is observed corresponding to infarcted areas. Both hemispheres
have infarcts even though the clot was injected only on the left (though the left infarct is larger). Also note the correspondence
of auto-fluorescent infarct-related signal (green arrowheads in C) and infarcted area on H&E staining (green arrowheads in D). Yellow scalebar1 mm. Black scale-bar200 m.

correlated thrombus and infarcts remain throughout this heterogeneity. Accumulation maps of total thrombi and infarcts (A,n47),
pseudocolor overlaid to indicate percentage of animals with lesions overlapping a specific pixel, show that thromboemboli and infarct
lesions are located mainly but not exclusively in the left MCA or ACA territory, as expected. Between the subgroups with (B,n31) and
without (B*, n16) emboli visualized in the right MCA—ACA bifurcation area (contralateral to the thrombus injection), infarct size and
distribution show significant differences as pointed out in the third template slice (arrows and arrowheads): bigger right hemispheric
infarcts and smaller left hemispheric infarcts in the former (21.521.6% and 37.124.0%) than in the latter (8.217.2% and
51.121.1%; P0.03 and P0.050, respectively). C The group with the left-to-right embolization has lower thromboemboli burden in
the left hemisphere (†1204623 pixels) than the group without has (‡19151261 pixels, P0.04), indicating that large left thrombi
caused large left infarcts (B*), whereas bilaterally distributed thrombus gave bilateral infarcts with the main left infarct generally being
smaller B. In the accumulation maps, blank regions mean ‘areas without lesion’ and blue (that corresponds to 0% at the lowest part of
the pseudocolor-bar) regions mean “areas with lesion, but without overlap.”

hemispheric infarcts were nonsignificantly bigger in the
animals with the left-to-right embolization than those without
(15.310.3% versus 9.115.5%; P0.17).
The group with the left-to-right embolization had lower
thromboemboli burden in the left hemisphere than did the
group without († versus ‡ in Figure 2C; P0.04). Considering
that the same volume of thrombus was injected into each
animal, left-to-right migration of some thrombus fragments
likely resulted in increase of the right hemispheric infarct
size; this corresponds to a reduction of thrombus burden in
the left MCA–ACA bifurcation, resulting in a decrease of the
left hemispheric infarct size. The other subgroup analyses
(Figure 3A–D; groups with/without thrombi in the left proximal
MCA or ACA) also demonstrated that thrombus imaging
is a useful tool for characterizing the heterogeneous
nature of embolic cerebral infarction in mice.
Laser-Doppler Arterial Flow Measurement Has
Modest Predictive Power for Infarct Size and
Correlates With Clot Imaging Findings
CBF variably decreased immediately after the placement of a
thrombus in the left MCA–ACA bifurcation area
(36.116.3%; range, 10.1–72.0%), followed by gradual increase
over 5 minutes reaching a plateau to 43.917.3%
(Figure 4A). Between the rCBF at 5 minutes and the left
hemispheric infarct size at 24 hours (41.220.2%; range,
10.5–84.3%; template slices 2–5), there was an inverse linear
correlation (P0.02; r0.34; Figure 4B). When dichotomization
was performed based on the median value (42%) of
the rCBF, the infarct size was nonsignificantly bigger in the
low rCBF group than in the high rCBF group (46.817.5%
versus 36.222.1%; P0.08). In the template slice-3 (approximately
1 mm posterior to the bregma), the low-rCBF
group had significantly bigger infarcts (54.9%) than did the
high rCBF group (39.1%; P0.02).
Infarct Size Could Be Better Predicted by
Incorporating Both Thrombus Burden and rCBF
Than by Considering Either One Alone
Total thrombus burden (including both hemispheres) at 24
hours showed a linear correlation with the final bihemispheric
infarct size (Supplemental Figure S2; P0.016; r0.35). In
addition, thrombus burden in the left hemisphere showed a
linear correlation with the final left hemispheric infarct size
(Figure 4C; P0.001; r0.50). When dichotomization was
performed based on the median value of the left hemispheric
thrombus burden (1865 pixels), infarct size was significantly
bigger in the big thrombi group than in the small thrombi
group (50.618.7% versus 31.317.0%; P0.001). Here,
we focused on the left hemispheric thrombus burden because
the main infarcts are located in the targeted left MCA
territory, and LDF does not cover the right MCA territory.
The main left infarct size was best predicted by thrombus
imaging combined with rCBF measurement (Figure 4D): the
big thrombi–low rCBF group had the biggest infarct volume
of 56.910.4%, followed by the big thrombi–high rCBF
group (45.923.5%), the small thrombi–low rCBF group
(35.717.3%), and the small thrombi–high rCBF group
(27.316.4%; Kruskal-Wallis test, P0.002). The big
thrombi–low rCBF group only had relatively small variability
in terms of the infarct size (Figure 4D*). Representative cases
(Figure 5A) and accumulation lesion maps (Figure 5B)
corroborate the quantitative data described above.
A regression analysis to include both parameters revealed
that the thrombus burden at 24 hours was statistically significant
in predicting final infarct size at 24 hours (P0.002),
whereas rCBF at 5 minutes lost significance (P0.34); this
suggests that the residual thrombus burden appeared to be
more influential than the initial rCBF was in determining the
final infarct size. According to the multivariate model, after
adjusting for the rCBF at 5 minutes, the final infarct size was

cerebral thromboembolism is related to
thrombus vascular location. The mice
with thrombi in the left proximal middle
cerebral artery (A,n36) have significantly
bigger left hemispheric infarcts
than the animals without (B,n11) have
(template slices 2–4; 48.120.1% vs
31.020.1%, P0.02). Mice with (C,n32)
vs without (D,n15) thrombi in the left

(P0.05). However, the animals with left
A1 thrombi seem to have bigger infarcts
in the frontal pole (template slice 1) than
the ones without have (19.422.8% vs
10.212.2, P0.09). The pseudocolor-bar
indicates percentage of animals with
lesions overlapping a specific pixel. In the

“areas without lesion” and blue (that corresponds
to 0% at the lowest part of the

estimated to increase by approximately 8% as the residual
thrombus burden increased by 1000 pixels (Supplemental
Table S1 and Supplemental Figure S1).
Computer Simulations Show That False Negative
Results in Neuroprotection Research Could Be
Reduced by Selecting More Homogenous Groups
Based on the Values of Both rCBF and
Thrombus Burden
When the animals with low rCBF and big thrombi (n12)
were included, false-negative results became 0% after applying
35% or higher neuroprotection rate. When neither of these
variables were considered, a 4-fold increase of sample size (to
n46) or either low rCBF (n12) or big thrombi (n12)
alone was considered, false-negative results became 0% after
applying approximately a 60% or higher neuroprotection rate.
Notably, even if LDF showed low rCBF, with a low thrombus
burden on thrombus imaging, it still had false-negative results
becoming relatively frequent (Figure 6).
Discussion
In the present study, we show that a widely used embolic
mouse model of stroke gives highly variable results. Using a
sensitive NIRF thrombus imaging technique, we observed
bilateral thromboemboli after a unilateral injection in one
third of cases. The exact distribution of emboli in an individual
animal would be a function of: the variable anatomy19 of
the circle of Willis in that animal, and the degree to which the
clot fragmented in that animal. We also found significant
variability in the volume of the target left hemisphere infarct,
ranging from 10.5–84.3%. This represents a significant
problem for stroke researchers, as final infarct volume is
frequently used as a measure of outcome, and this variable
needs to be as predictable as possible, or else subtle therapeutic
effects might not be detected.
The solution to the problem of infarct variability is to have
feedback mechanisms in place that allow one to know what
sort of infarct one has achieved. We explored an optical
molecular imaging approach to manage the variability in
mouse embolic models of stroke, specifically by using direct
thrombus imaging that attempts to image the root cause of
embolic infarct: the thrombus itself.12 We compared direct
thrombus imaging to laser-Doppler flowmeter measurement
in the cerebral vasculature, a novel imaging parameter contrasted
to a well-known pathophysiological flow measure-

the heterogeneous nature of ipsilateral cerebral thromboembolism. After thrombus injection, cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases variably
, followed by gradual increase over 5 minutes and then reaching a plateau (A). Scatter plots show that lower rCBF at 5 minutes is
associated with a bigger infarct at 24 hours (B) and bigger thrombus burden at 24 hours is associated with a bigger infarct at 24 hours
(C). When dichotomizations were performed based on the median values (vertical lines of B and C), box plots show that the subgroup *
with low rCBF and big thrombi has the biggest infarct size with the narrowest variability (D). Here, 1 animal was excluded because of
incomplete triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining data.

Figure 5. Representative cases A and accumulation lesion maps B to corroborate the quantitative data in Figure 4. The first animal has a large
thrombus, and a persistently low CBF, and has a large infarct, as expected. The second animal also has a big thrombus, but CBF did not stay
down, giving rise to an infarct, but smaller than in the first case. The third animal has a low and fragmented thrombus burden (arrowhead), in the
face of a CBF that stays low, and a small infarct results. The fourth animal has a fragmented and low thrombus burden and a CBF that quickly
recovers, and has a small infarct. Lesion maps show this cumulatively for groups of animals. In the first group, with large thrombus burden and persistently
reduced CBF, large infarcts are seen in nearly all animals (note the red areas on lesion maps indicating all animals having lesions at that
location). In the second group with large thrombus but a CBF that recovers, we again see ipsilateral infarct in all animals, but less extensive than in
the first group. The third and fourth groups indicate animals with low thrombus burden and persistently low and recovered CBF values respectively.
In both these groups, the penetrance of infarct is much less and quite variable. The pseudocolor bar indicates percentage of animals with lesions
overlapping a specific pixel. In the accumulation maps, blank regions mean “areas without lesion” and blue (that corresponds to 0% at the lowest
part of the pseudocolor-bar) regions mean “areas with lesion, but without overlap.”

ment. LDF has been widely used as a way to assess the
effectiveness of vessel occlusion, and in the setting of suture
MCA occlusion models, correlates highly with final infarct
volume.17 However, this method of monitoring was reported
to be deficient in predicting the outcome of embolic stroke
models,20 which is unfortunate, as embolic models are those
that most closely mimic the process of infarction commonly
seen in humans.6
In our work, we have showed that thrombus imaging
allowed ex vivo visualization of cerebral thrombus burden
and distribution, which was closely correlated with final
infarct volume and distribution. LDF enabled useful and
immediate feedback,20 but its predictive capability for final
infarct volume was more modest than was imaging thrombus
burden, as was shown by the multivariate analysis.
The combination of thrombus imaging and rCBF allowed
the best predictive results, and allowed the identification of
large-volume, low-variability infarcts in approximately a
quarter of animals: the subgroup with low rCBF at 5 minutes
and big thrombi at 24 hours. By contrast, animals with low
rCBF on LDF, when combined with small thrombus burden
on thrombus imaging, had highly variable infarct sizes. In
these animals, spontaneous thrombolysis with or without
distal embolization likely occurred. We observed that rCBF
immediately following the placement of a thrombus in the
MCA was variable, but generally we saw a sharp decrease of
flow followed by a slow increase of flow, probably caused by
spontaneous thrombolysis.
Unmanaged infarct variability can cause great hardship to
the stroke researcher and raise noise levels in mouse embolic
infarct experiments to such high levels that therapeutic effects
might be drowned out. We performed a simulation experiment
for various cases where infarct variability was and was
not controlled for, and found that therapeutic effects could be
detected with far greater reliability if thrombus imaging and
rCBF measurement were both used to select the best infarct
subgroup. The implications in real-life research are obvious:
by excluding highly variable animals, the discriminating
power of experiments will increase, and false-negative results
can be avoided. In addition, researchers could use thrombus
imaging data for predefined posthoc adjustment or stratification
of original outcome data.
This study, the first report on performing NIRF thrombus
imaging and mapping in mouse embolic stroke, should be
considered in the light of the following limitations. First,
although thrombus imaging was found to be useful in our
work, it still is an ex vivo, postmortem, imaging technique,
not allowing more than a snapshot of time. Using transcranial
window12 or NIRF tomography might allow in vivo serial
monitoring of clot evolution in the future. Future advances in
imaging may yet make noninvasive in vivo imaging of
thrombus burden possible in the intact animal. Second, it is
uncertain how much the labeling procedure alters natural clot
biology. Last, late behavioral studies were not performed.
Improved in vivo imaging studies might allow better behavioral
outcome research to be conducted.
In summary, we have shown that embolic models of infarct
in mice, although faithful mimics of infarcts in human
patients, are beset by the same heterogeneity of tissue
outcome that we also observe in humans, making research
using these models difficult. We offer a helpful research tool
to researchers hoping to control for infarct variability: direct
thrombus imaging and laser-Doppler flowmeter measurements.
These 2 tools in conjunction allowed for stratification
of animals and selection of a subset of homogenous infarcts
that were suitable for the detection of subtle therapeutic
effects.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental Methods
Synthesis of the C15 Near-Infrared Fluorescent Thrombus Marker
Factor XIIIa substrate peptide (GNQEQVSPLTLLKWC, 1mg) was synthesized using 
standard solid-phase Fmoc peptide chemistry (Peptron, Daejeon, Korea). To obtain 
Cy5.5-maleimide, Cy5.5 N-hydroxysuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, 
IL; 1mg, excitation / emission = 675nm / 695nm) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS,  400  μl,  pH  7.0;  Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was mixed with N-[βmaleimidopropionic
acid] hydrazide, trifluoroacetic acid salt (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
3mg) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Sigma-Aldrich, 2mg) 
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 100 μl; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4h. The product 
was purified by C18 semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC: 40 % to 70 % acetonitrile 
vs. 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate over 20min at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min. Purity (> 
95 %) was confirmed by HPLC. Cy5.5-maleimide fractions were collected and 
lyophilized. For site-specific conjugation of Cy5.5 to the thiol of the cysteine adjacent 
to the recognition sequence of FXIIIa substrate peptide, the peptide (2.5μmol)  was 
reacted with Cy5.5-maleimide (2.5 μmol) in PBS (100 μl, pH 7.0) for 4h. The product 
(TRIAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-684266505)
was further purified by C18 semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC: 40 % to 70 % 
acetonitrile vs. 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate over 20min at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min.
Purity (> 95 %) was confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and C15 
NIRF imaging probe fractions were collected and lyophilized.
Mouse Embolic Stroke Model
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane using an inhalation mask, and cerebral 
blood flow was monitored using a laser-Doppler flowmeter (Omegawave, Tokyo, 
Japan). A homeothermic blanket (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) was used to keep body 
temperature at 36.5°C. The left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery 
(ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed through the midline neck incision 
and dissection of the peri-vascular tissue. The ECA was ligated with coagulation of the 
origin of superficial temporary artery. The CCA was clamped using a microvascular clip
(S&T AG, Neuhausen, Switzerland), and then the ICA was clamped after separating it 
from the adjacent vagus nerve. After making a puncture in the ECA proximal to which it 
was tied, a tapered PE-45 catheter containing the clot was inserted via the small hole, 
then turned toward the ICA. Immediately after the microvascular clip clamping the ICA 
was  removed,  the  catheter  was  advanced  about  9mm  toward  the  MCA―ACA 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1454794433)
bifurcation area. After the injection of the thrombus, the catheter was carefully removed, 
followed by the ligation of the ECA and declamping of the CCA.
NIRF Macroscopic / Microscopic Imaging
NIRF imaging was performed as published previously.1-3 Briefly, the excised brains or 
brain sections were imaged by using a NIRF imager (KOS. Inc., Seoul, Korea) with a 
charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap-EZ, Roper-Scientific, Tucson, AZ). White 
light, FITC-channel (excitation/emission, 492nm/520nm; 1 second acquisition), and 
Cy5.5 NIRF-channel (excitation/emission, 675nm/690nm; 1 second acquisition) images 
were acquired. Fluorescence microscopy (Olympus-BX61, Tokyo, Japan) was used to 
visualize the distribution of Cy5.5 fluorescence (2 second acquisition) in the brain 
cryosections. After the microscopic imaging, the sections were H/E stained to confirm 
that the NIRF signals co-localized with intra-arterial thromboemboli.
Quantitative Lesional Topography Analyses
Cy5.5 thrombus signals on the NIRF images were mapped on a template (Supplemental 
Figure 1) that was prepared by using a published figure of brain vasculature, including 
proximal / distal MCA (M1/M2) and ACA (A1/A2), at the circle of Willis in a C57/BL6 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1454794433)
mouse.4 A custom-built software package was used for the mapping; the software allows 
semi-automatic segmentation and transfer of lesions from a subject’s preclinical or 
clinical brain images onto a standard brain template set.1 After the storage of the final 
registration results, the left or right hemispheric thrombus burden (pixel numbers) is 
automatically calculated and provided on queries. In addition, color-coded maps can be 
produced by summation of multiple maps with color coding to indicate the amount of 
lesion overlap.
To analyze the distribution of ischemic brain injury
1
5, 6, whitish infarct areas on the 
TTC stained sections were mapped on a template set that consists of six brain sections 
(slice numbers 1 ~ 6 at 2.96, 0.98, -1.06, -3.08, -4.60, -6.36mm distant from the bregma, 
respectively).7 The mean TTC images were acquired using the software package 
described above, and the left or right hemispheric infarct area (pixel numbers) could be 
obtained. The infarct size was calculated as a percentage of the left-sided or bilateral 
hemispheric area of selected template slices. The data of multiple template slices were 
averaged for the correlation studies or multivariate studies between the final total (slice 
numbers 1―6) or left hemispheric (2―5) infarct size vs. rCBF (% cerebral blood flow 
relative to the baseline value) and / or thrombus burden in the bilateral or left-sided 
circle of Willis and nearby arteries of the basal brain.

Computer-simulated Virtual Neuroprotection Research
Neuroprotection research depends critically on knowing how much infarct volume was 
altered by a treatment. In the absence of real data on how much infarct there is to start 
with (as can be obtained by performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)8 prior to 
treatment allocation), smaller protective effects could easily be overwhelmed by noise, 
and not be statistically detected. In order to quantify the potential benefits doing NIRF 
thrombus imaging and rCBF monitoring, we did the following computer simulation 
experiment: selected animals from the present study cohort were randomly assigned to 
either a control group or a treatment group, with this random assignment done prior to 
every experiment performed during the simulation. For the animals in the treatment 
group, infarct size was decreased from the measured values by 0~100% at 21 steps: 0, 5, 
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100%. This 
simulates the effect of neuroprotection regimens decreasing infarct size over a spectrum 
of effectiveness. We did these simulation runs for the following cases: no selection
(n=46) or selecting a quarter of the animals―the ones with low rCBF (n=12; lowest 
quartile), big thrombi (n=12; highest quartile), a combined low rCBF and big thrombi 
(n=12; dichotomizations based on the median values), or a combined low rCBF and 
(8.0.0.2542.1873950470 PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSIOn)
small thrombi (n=11; dichotomizations based on the median values). For each group, 
1,000 random divisions were made into control and treatment groups, with each 
assessed at 21 steps of neuroprotection. If the t-test for each individual experiment was 
P<0.05, then the experiment was counted as detecting neuroprotection.
Supplemental Results
Quantitative Thrombus / Infarct Maps Visualize the Heterogeneous
Nature of the Embolic Stroke Model
Accumulation maps of thrombus and infarct locations showed that scattered emboli 
were frequently observed not only in the bifurcation area but also in the adjacent or 
remote cerebral arteries: left M1 (77.1%), left A1 (66.7%), left ICA (54.2%), left M2 
(54.2%), left A2 (47.9%), right A2 (22.9%), right A1 (18.8%), right M2 (10.4%), right 
M1 (8.3%), and right ICA (6.3%). While one third of the animals had thrombi 
visualized in the right anterior circulation territory, small numbers of animals had 
fluorescent thrombus signal that was restricted to either left M1 (6.3%) or A1 (4.1%).
Three animals (6.3%) had no thrombus signal at all. Scattered infarcts were frequently 
observed not only in the left MCA territory but also in the adjacent or remote areas of
