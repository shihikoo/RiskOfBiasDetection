With neuroprotective approaches having failed until recently, current focus on experimental stroke research has
switched towards manipulation of post-ischemic neuroregeneration. Transplantation of subventricular zone
(SVZ) derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is a promising strategy for promotion of neurological recovery. Yet,
fundamental questions including the optimal cell delivery route still have to be addressed. Consequently, male
C57BL6 mice were exposed to transient focal cerebral ischemia and allowed to survive for as long as 84 days
post-stroke. At 6 h post-stroke, NPCs were grafted using six different cell delivery routes, i.e., intravenous,
intraarterial, ipsilateral intrastriatal, contralateral intrastriatal, ipsilateral intraventricular and ipsilateral
intracortical injection. Control mice received PBS only using the aforementioned delivery routes. Intralesional
numbers of GFP+NPCs were high only after ipsilateral intrastriatal transplantation, whereas other injection paradigms
only yielded comparatively small numbers of grafted cells. However, acute neuroprotection and improved
functional outcome were observed after both systemic (i.e., intraarterial and intravenous) and ipsilateral
intrastriatal transplantation only. Whereas systemic cell delivery induced acute and long-term neuroprotection,
reduction of brain injury after ipsilateral intrastriatal cell grafting was only temporary, in line with the loss of
transplanted NPCs in the brain. Both systemic and ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC delivery reduced microglial activation
and leukocyte invasion, thus reducing free radical formation within the ischemic brain. On the contrary, only
systemic NPC administration stabilized the blood–brain-barrier and reduced leukocytosis in the blood. Although
intraarterial NPC transplantation was as effective as intravenous cell grafting, mortality of stroke mice was high
using the intraarterial delivery route. Consequently, intravenous delivery of native NPCs in our experimental
model is an attractive and effective strategy for stroke therapy that deserves further proof-of-concept studies.

1. Introduction
The application of stem cells and progenitor cells has become a promising
yet experimental tool for adjuvant stroke therapy (Bacigaluppi et al.,
2009; Banerjee et al., 2012; Bliss et al., 2010; Leong et al., 2012). Since embryonic
stem cells are not feasible for future clinical therapies due to both
tumor formation rates and ethical concerns (Blum and Benvenisty, 2008,
2009), transplantation of adult stem or progenitor cells may be preferable.
Among the latter, adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are frequently
used in various models of cerebral ischemia (Bacigaluppi et al., 2009; Chu
et al., 2008; Doeppner et al., 2010). NPCs can be obtained from different
tissue sources (Seaberg and van der Kooy, 2002), with cells derived
from the subventricular zone (SVZ) as one of the most common areas
for NPC preparation (Rietze and Reynolds, 2006). Within this neurogenic
niche containing different cell populations such as astrocyte-like type B
cells representing neural stem cells (Doetsch et al., 1997), NPCs can be
transferred to cell culture and thus expanded. When grafted either locally
or systemically, NPCs are able to induce neuroprotection within the ischemic
rodent brain (Bacigaluppi et al., 2008, 2009; Darsalia et al., 2011;
Dibajnia and Morshead, 2013; Giusto et al., 2014; Minnerup et al.,
2011). However, fundamental questions regarding both safety and efficacy
of transplanted NPCs after cerebral ischemia yet have to be addressed.
Among the aforementioned concerns of NPC and stem cell transplantation
issues such as the optimal transplantation time point as
well as the optimal cell delivery route have to be critically addressed before
NPC transplantation can be transferred into the clinic as a sound

and safe therapeutic concept (Reyes et al., 2015). Recent work by our
groupsuggests that systemicintravenousdelivery of native NPCs is likely
to induce sustained neuroprotection in the mouse even when
transplanted as late as four weeks post-stroke (Doeppner et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, profound and systematic analyses of most“ideal”cell delivery
routes are scarce, albeit intravenous cell delivery is more feasible
than local cell grafting from the clinical point of view.
Previous studies describe various cell delivery routes such as intravenous
, intracerebral, intraventricular or intraarterial cell transplantation
(Andres et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2008; Chua et al., 2011; Doeppner et al.,
2010; Kelly et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2013), but only a
few of them systematically analyzed the effects of transplantation routes
on properties of grafted cells and on functional outcome of animals (Jin
et al., 2005; Li et al., 2010; Modo et al., 2002). These studies are, however,
hampered by either short observation time points (Jin et al., 2005; Li
et al., 2010) or a limited number of cell delivery routes used (Modo
et al., 2002). Consequently, we systematically analyzed consequences
of delivery routes on restorative effects of NPCs. At six hours poststroke
, NPCs were grafted by intravenous injections of cells into the
right femoral vein, by intraarterialgrafting into the left common carotid
artery (CCA), and by stereotactic transplantation of NPCs into the ipsilateral
striatum, the contralateral striatum, the ipsilateral cerebral cortex
outside the ischemic territory and the ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental procedure and animals used
Studies were performed according to standards of good scientific
practice and were approved by local authorities. Male C57BL6 mice
(25–27 g; Charles River, Germany) were kept under circadian rhythm
and had free access to food and water. The study included two survival
time points, i.e., sacrifice of animals on day 2 and on day 84 after induction
of stroke. Mice were randomly attributed to either treatment group
or control group, with experimenters being blinded to the experimental
paradigm. Treatment consisted of administration of either SVZ-derived
NPCs or injection of PBS at six hours post-stroke. Animals that were attributed
to the 84-day survival groups were used for behavioral analysis
as well. As such, mice were trained on days 1–2 before induction of
stroke in order to assure proper performance in the behavioral tests.
The numbers of animals used for statistical analysis including survival
ratesare given for both NPC-treated andPBS-treated animalsinthesupplementary
section of the manuscript (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
At the time points given animals were sacrificed and samples were used
for measurement of various parameters.
2.2. Transient focal cerebral ischemia
All animals were exposed to 45 min of focal cerebral ischemia using
the thread occlusion model as previously described (Doeppner et al.,
2009). Briefly, mice were kept under deep anesthesia (1.0–1.5%
isoflurane, 30% N
2
O, remainder O
2
) under constant laser-Dopplerflow
(LDF) control by means of a flexible fiberoptic probe (Perimed,
Sweden) that was placed above the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory.
Cerebral ischemia was induced via insertion of a 7-0 silicon coated
nylon monofilament (Doccol, USA; 180μm diameter at the tip) into the
common carotid artery. Thefilament was then gently pushed upwards
until 9 mm distal from the carotid bifurcation into the left MCA. Thefilament
was removed after 45 min and LDF control was continued for an
additional 15 min in order to assure proper reperfusion.
2.3. Cultivation and transplantation of neural progenitor cells
Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were harvested from the SVZ of
transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing enhanced greenfluorescence
protein (EGFP) under actin promoter control (6–8 weeks old male
C57BL/6-Tg ACTB-EGFP, 1Osb/J; JAX Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA) as described
previously (Doeppner et al., 2014). Cells were cultivated under
standard cell culture conditions and supplemented with epidermal
growth factor (EGF, 2 μg/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 2
μg/ml), and penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen, Frankfurt, Germany)
every 2–3 days. Cells were passaged after 7–10 days.For transplantation
studies, NPCs from passages 3–8wereused.
Transplantation of NPCs as well as injection of PBS was always performed
6 h after induction of cerebral ischemia with PBS injection following
the very same delivery routes as given for NPC transplantation.
The cell doses chosenfor thedifferent treatmentparadigmsrefer to previous
studies of our group (Doeppner et al., 2012a, 2014). For intravenous
cell grafting, 106 cells (solved in 200 μl of PBS) were injected
into the right femoralveinusing aninjectionrate of 10 min.Intraarterial
injection of NPCs and PBS into the distal left CCA followed a modified
protocol by Chua and colleagues (Chua et al., 2011). Thus, 106 NPCs
solved in 200 μl of PBS were injected over 10 min into the CCA. Transplantation
of NPCs into the left ischemic and right non-ischemic striatum
was done by means of a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments,
Tujunga, CA, USA) at 0.4 mm anterior, 1.8 mm lateral and 3.5 mm ventral
from bregma. NPCs (5× 105cells solved in5μl PBS) were injected at
a rate of 1 μl/min with the Hamilton syringe (Bonaduz, Switzerland),
which was kept in situ for an additional 5 min before removal of the
needle. Injections into the left lateral ventricle were performed using
the same experimental paradigm as described above at 0.2 mm posterior
, 1.0 mm lateral and 2.2 mm ventral from bregma. For intracortical injections
, coordinates were 3.5 mm lateral and 3.5 mm ventral from
bregma. Applying a volume of 1 μl, a total amount of 105 cells was
injected over 1 min.
2.4. Behavioral tests
Post-stroke functional impairment was analyzed on animals used
for the long-term survival period, which was 84 days in our study.
Behavioral tests included the rota rod, the tight rope, the corner
turn, and the balance beam test. All animals were trained on the
day before induction of cerebral ischemia, with actual tests being
done on days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84. The rota rod as well as the tight
rope test were performed twice per test day as previously described
by our group (Doeppner et al., 2011). Briefly, mice were put on the
rota rod (TSE Systems, Germany) with an accelerating speed
(4–40 rpm). The maximal test time was 300 s, and the time until
the animal dropped from the rotating drum was used for statistical
analysis. As for the tight rope test, mice were put on the middle of
a 60 cm long rope that was attached to a platform on either side.
Maximal testing time was 60 s. The animal was scored according to
a validated test score depending on whether or not it reached the
platform; score was from 0 (min) until 20 (max).
Thecorner turntest was performed as described before (Zhang et al.,
2002). Briefly, two vertical boards were attached to each other in an
angle of 30°. Readout parameter was the side chosen by which the animals
chose to leave the corner once it made contact with either of the
two boards via its whiskers. Whereas healthy animals leave the corner
randomly, ischemic mice prefer to leave the corner using the nonimpaired
body side. Data is presented calculating the laterality index
((number of left turns− number of right turns) / 10) out of 10 trials
per test day and condition.
For the balance beam test (Luong et al., 2011), mice were put on a
110 cm long beam that constantly narrowed starting with a width of
12 mm and ending with a width of 5 mm. The wooden beam was
60 cm elevated from the ground, and a platform was located at the
end of the beam. The time until the animal reached the platform was
counted with a maximal testing time of 60 s. Mice that did not reach
the platform were scored 60 s. Tests were performed twice per time
point, for which mean values were calculated.

2.5. Differentiation analysis of grafted NPCs
Animals were sacrificed on day 84 in order to analyze differentiation
patterns of grafted cells. Thereafter, brains were removed and shockfrozen
, which were used for preparation of cryostat sections (20 μm
each). During tissue processing, quenching of the GFPfluorescence signal
occurs, thus requiring additional staining with a polyclonal rabbit
anti-GFP antibody (1:2500; Abcam, UK) in order to enhance GFP signal
intensity (secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:500;
Abcam)). Double stainings were performed using a variety of primary
antibodies. These included a goat polyclonal anti-doublecortin (Dcx)
antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Germany) for assessment
of immature neuronal differentiation, a rat polyclonal anti-GFAP (glial
fibrillary acidic protein) antibody (1:500; Zymed, UK) for astroglial differentiation
, a mouse monoclonal anti-CNPase (2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide
3′-phosphodiesterase) antibody (1:400; Millipore, UK) for oligodendroglial
differentiation, a mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody
(1:1000; Millipore) for mature neuronal differentiation and a mouse
monoclonal anti-nestin antibody (1:500; Millipore).
The primary antibodies were incubated for 18 h at a temperature of
4 °C. Incubation with secondary antibodies was done after repeated
washing steps for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The following secondary
antibodies were used: goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (1:400; Invitrogen,
Germany), donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (1:250; Invitrogen), goat antimouse
Cy-3 (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, UK).
2.6. Analysis of post-ischemic brain injury
In order to verify whether or not the site of transplantation affects
post-ischemic brain injury, we analyzed the number of TUNEL+ cells
as well as neuronal densities on day 2 and on day 84 post-stroke. Sections
were prepared as stated above and used for quantitative analyses
by defining regions of interest (ROIs) within the ischemic striatum. The
stereotactic coordinates were AP +0.14 mm, ML ±1.5–2.25 mm and
DV−2.5–3.25 mm. For statistical analysis, four sections per ROI and animal
were used.
For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL), sections were incubated with proteinase K (7 min
at 37 °C) followed by exposure to the TdT enzyme reaction as indicated in
the manufacturer's manual (Roche, Switzerland). Thereafter, sections
were stained with a streptavidin-Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody
(2 h at RT; Invitrogen) and analyzed. Neuronal densities were determined
using NeuN staining within the aforementioned ROIs. A mouse
monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:1000; Millipore) served as primary antibody,
which had been incubated for 18 h at 4 °C followed by several washing
steps. Thereafter, a goat anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:400; Invitrogen,
Germany) was used for 1 h at RT. Assessment of microglial activity was
done by means of IB
4
staining using a rat biotin-conjugated anti-IB
4
antibody
(1:100; Vector Labs, UK). Again, quantitative analysis was performed
using the same ROIs as mentioned above.
2.7. Assessment of post-ischemic neuroregeneration
For assessment of post-stroke endogenous cell proliferation, mice received
daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 5-bromo-2-desoxyuridine
(BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; 50 mg per kg body weight) on days
8–28. On day 84 after induction of stroke, the animals were sacrificed,
and sections were prepared as stated afore. In order to analyze the fate
of differentiation of new-born proliferating BrdU+ cells, co-staining
with various antibodies followed by subsequent quantitative analyses
in the aforementioned ROIs was performed. Primary antibodies included
a monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Roche, Switzerland), a
monoclonal rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Abcam), a goat polyclonal
anti-doublecortin antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse
monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (1:1000; Millipore), and a rat anticluster
of differentiation (CD)31 antibody (1:200, BD Biosciences,
Germany). Secondary antibodies were as follows: goat anti-mouse Cy-3
(1:400; Dianova, Germany), goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (1:400; Dianova),
goat anti-rat Alexa 488 (1:250; Invitrogen, Germany), donkey anti-goat
Alexa 488 (1:250; Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:100; Jackson
ImmunoResearch, UK).
2.8. Analysis of peripheral and central immune responses
Immune responses after induction of stroke within both the blood
andthebrainweredoneusingflow cytometry analysis. Two days after
stroke, absolute amounts of leukocytes (CD45þ high) were measured following
a modified protocol from Chu and colleagues (Chu et al., 2014).
Upon sacrifice of mice, blood samples were taken via cardiac puncture,
and the animal was transcardially perfusion with PBS followed by removal
of the brain. Before usage of blood samples, leukocytes were purified using a lysis buffer (155 mM NH
4
Cl, 10 mM KHCO
3
and 3 mM EDTA).
The brain samples (left hemispheres only) werefirst mechanically homogenized
in a buffer of collagenase type XI (125 U/ml), hyaluronidase
(60 U/ml) and collagenase (450 U/ml) in Ca2+/Mg2+-supplemented
PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). All samples were incubated for 20 min
at 37 °C under constant and gentle agitation with subsequent usage of
70 mm nylon cell strainers. Upon achieving single cell suspensions,
cells were collected and washed in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin.
The cells were incubated with a rat anti-CD45 (BioLegend, Germany) antibody
for 30 min at 4 °C. Absolute cell numbers were determined by
means of countbright counting beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Analysis of cells was done using an LSR II (BD Biosciences) and FACS
Diva software (BD Biosciences).
2.9. Measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)
In order to indirectly assess oxidative stress, the amount of TBARS
was measured on day 2 after induction of stroke as previously described
(Doeppner et al., 2012b). Brains were therefore removed and left hemispheres
were complemented with lysis buffer (50 mmol/l Tris, pH 8.0,
150 mmol/l NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors), homogenized
and centrifuged. Lysates were then centrifuged, and supernatants
were used for photometric analysis.
2.10. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of selected growth
factors
The contents of growth factors as an indicator of modulation of the
post-ischemic milieu was performed as previously described
(Doeppner et al., 2014). Measurements were performed using left homogenized
hemispheres on day 84 after induction of stroke. The lysis
buffer contained 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl
2
,
0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN
3
and 1% Triton X-100. These samples were
used for detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; R&D
Systems, USA), nerve growth factor (NGF; Promega, Germany), brainderived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Promega), glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Promega), FGF (R&D Systems) and EGF
(R&D Systems) using commercially available mouse ELISA kits.
2.11. Western blots
Western blots against occludin were performed on day 2 using the
very same samples obtained for determination of TBARS as described
afore by our group (Doeppner et al., 2012b; ElAli et al., 2011). Briefly,
equal amounts of protein (40μg) were loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide
gels. Thereafter, proteins were transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride
membranes, which were immersed in blocking solution (5% milk in
0.1% Tween 20 + Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated with a goat anti-occludin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
). Membranes were incubated with a peroxidase-coupled donkey
anti-goat secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed

several times, immersed in enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution
and exposed to ECL-Hyperfilm. Blots were used for densitometric
analysis with individual values referring to actin expression, which
served as loading control.
2.12. Matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) zymography
MMP-9 activity was determined using a zymography assay as previously
described (Doeppner et al., 2012b). Briefly, left hemispheres were
retrieved on day 2 after induction of stroke. Hemispheres were homogenized
in lysis buffer (basic buffer) at 4 °C, which consisted of 50 mmol/l
Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/l NaCl, 5 mmol/l CaCl
2
, 0.05% BRIJ-35,
0.02% NaN
3
and 1% Triton X-100. The samples were centrifuged and
the pellets were resuspended in an elution buffer (basic buffer containing
10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 20% volume of lysis buffer). Protein concentrations
were measured by means of the bicinchoninic acid method
(BCA kit, Thermo Scientific, Germany).
MMP-9 was separated into its pro-form and active form using Novex
Zymogram Gels (Invitrogen). The samples were incubated in a nonreducing
sample buffer (0.4 mol/l Tris, pH 6.8, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) for 10 min at RT.
For electrophoresis, a 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin was
used. Thereafter, samples were incubated with 2.5% Triton X-100
twice for 20 min and equilibrated with developing buffer (Novex).
The samples were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and gels were stained
with Coomassie blue for 30 min. Human pro-MMP-9 (0.1 ng) and activated
MMP-9 (0.01 ng; both from Merck Biosciences, Germany) were
used as standards.Finally, gels were scanned and used for densitometric
analysis.
2.13. Analysis of blood–brain-barrier (BBB) integrity
The assay followed a modified protocol based on the detection of extravasated
Evans blue in order to assess the integrity of the BBB (Chiba
et al., 2008). Therefore, Evans blue (2%; 2 ml/kg body weight) was intravenously
injected 46 h (i.e., two hours before sacrifice) after stroke.
Upon sacrifice of the animal, the latter was transcardially perfused
with PBS and the brain removed. After weighing and homogenization
of the left hemisphere includingcentrifugation steps, thecontents of extracted
Evans blue was measured after further dilution of Evans blue.
Thefluorescence signal was determined with a luminescence spectrophotometer
with an excitation wavelength of 620 nm and an emission
wavelength of 680 nm. An external standard (62.5–500 ng/ml) served
for setting of Evans Blue contents.

3. Results
3.1. Post-stroke functional recovery strictly depends on NPC delivery routes
Assessment of post-stroke motor coordination deficits showed enhanced
performance in all four behavioral tests at early time points
after systemic (i.a. and i.v.) and ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC transplantation
(Fig. 1). For instance, balance beam test performance on day 4 was
25.9 ± 2.7 s (i.v. NPC grafting) vs. 43.3 ± 4.2 s (i.v. control; p: 0.026),
26.8 ± 3.3 s (i.a. NPC grafting) vs. 45.1 ± 2.1 s (i.a. control; p: 0.019),
and 28.2 ± 5.4 s (ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC grafting) vs. 39.2 ± 4.2 s
(ipsilateral intrastriatal control; p: 0.031). Notably, ipsilateral
intrastriatal cell transplantation only yielded short-term motor coordination
improvement. Following systemic NPC delivery, however, motor coordination
improvement was stable for at least 84 days. We observed a
balance beam test performance, for instance, of 17.2 ± 2.3 s (NPCs) vs.
35.7 ± 1.8 s (control) after i.v. transplantation (p: 0.008) and a test
performance of 19.2 ± 1.4 s (NPCs) vs. 29.1 ± 3.2 s (control) after i.v.
transplantation (p: 0.032). Noteworthy, mortality rates after i.a. transplantation
of NPCs was significantly increased in long-term survival
groups when compared to i.v. NPC grafting (p: 0.044). Importantly,
local delivery of NPCs in injury-remote cerebral structures, i.e., in the
contralateral striatum, the cerebral cortex or the lateral ventricle, did
not result in motor coordination improvement.
3.2. NPC accumulation is high after ipsilateral intrastriatal transplantation
Based on these results, we next determined numbers of grafted
GFP+ NPCs within the ischemic lesion site on day 2 as well as on day
84 post-stroke (Fig. 2). Transplantation of NPCs into the ipsilateral
(ischemic) striatum yielded the highest number of cells throughout
the observation period (338.1 ± 38.1 NPCs/mm2 on day 2 and
109.7 ± 24.1 NPCs/mm2on day 84). On the contrary, local cell grafting
within the ipsilateral lateral ventricle and cortex or the contralateral
striatum was associated with particularly small NPC numbers (on day
2 post-stroke 27.1 ± 6.2 NPCs/mm2 vs. 19.7 ± 2.8 NPCs/mm2 vs.
23.1 ± 4.9 NPCs/mm2), even less compared with systemic (i.v. and
i.a.) cell delivery (on day 2 post-stroke 73.7 ± 15.2 NPCs/mm2 vs.
80.4 ± 22.5 NPCs/mm2). In all conditions examined, NPC numbers
slightly decreased from the subacute to the chronic stage of the disease.
The quantitative data analysis for day 84 revealed 38.6 ± 7.6 NPCs/mm2
(i.v.), 49.2 ± 11.5 NPCs/mm2(i.a.), 9.4 ± 3.6 NPCs/mm2(contralateral

(lateral ventricle).
3.3. Cell delivery routes do not affect differentiation of grafted NPCs
In order to assess differentiation rates of grafted cells, the expression
of astroglial, oligodendroglial and neural markers was evaluated in
GFP+ NPCs on day 84 (Fig. 3). Whereas GFP+ grafted NPCs showed
abundant expression of the neural markers nestin and doublecortin
(Dcx), only small fractions of cells expressed the oligodendroglial marker
CNPase, theastroglialmarker (GFAP) or the neuronal marker (NeuN).
No significant difference was observed under the various experimental
conditions. Noteworthy, absolute numbers of NPCs co-expressing the
aforementioned markers were significantly increased after intrastriatal
transplantation (data not shown) due to increased intracerebral numbers
of NPCs detectable using this cell delivery route (Fig. 2). As such,
NPC delivery routes do not affect differentiation rates of grafted cells.
3.4. Histological brain injury depends on NPC delivery route
Since reduction of post-stroke motor coordination impairment after
NPC transplantation does not necessarily reflectimproved structuraltissue
survival, brain injury was analyzed on day 2 and on day 84 (Fig. 4).
Assessment within the lesion site on day 2 post-stroke revealed a decreased
number of TUNEL+ cells after both systemic (i.v. and i.a.) and
ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC transplantation (Fig. 4A–C). Numbers of

controls (p: 0.019). On the contrary, long-term neuroprotection
was only achieved after systemic cell delivery (Fig. 4D). We
observed an amount of NeuN+ cells of 778.2 ± 72.1/mm2 after i.v.
transplantation of NPCs vs. 421.4 ± 67.2/mm2 in corresponding controls
(p: 0.011) and an amount of NeuN+ of 823.1 ± 88.4/mm2 after
i.a. transplantation of NPCs vs. 389.4 ± 89.2/mm2in corresponding controls
(p: 0.020). Local lesion-remote delivery of NPCs into the contralateral
striatum, ipsilateral cerebral cortex or lateral ventricle did not
influence cell injury.
3.5. Subacute neurovascular remodeling varies with NPC delivery routes
In view of differentiated effects of various NPC transplantation strategies
, we next examined the question whether or not cell delivery routes
also affected mechanisms of brain injury to different extents (Fig. 5).
Blood–brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown as assessed by extravasation of
Evans blue (Fig. 5A) as well as activation of MMP-9 (Fig. 5B & Suppl.
Fig. 2), which contributes to BBB breakdown by extracellular matrix degradation
, was significantly attenuated after systemic NPC delivery only.
Evans blue extravasation after i.v. delivery was 5.2 ± 2.1 μg/g in the
NPC group in comparison to 9.5 ± 3.7μg/g in controls (p: 0.038), whereas
extravasation after i.a. delivery was 5.2 ± 2.1 μg/g in the NPC group in
comparison to 10.6 ± 2.8 μg/g in controls (p: 0.024). In this context,
MMP-9 activation (arbitrary units) after i.v. delivery of NPCs was

MMP-9 activation after i.a. delivery of NPCs was 40.1 ± 5.9 in comparison
to 102.0 ± 22.5 in controls (p: 0.037). Further analysis regarding integrity
of the BBB involved determination of post-stroke occludin abundance
using Western blot determination. In line with the aforementioned results
on Evans blue extravasation and MMP-9 activation, the strokeinduced
degradation of occludin was reversed when NPCs were grafted
using the i.v. or i.a. delivery route (Suppl. Fig. 2). On the other hand,
both systemic and ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC transplantation reduced
oxidative stress (Fig. 5C) and microglial reactivity in the ischemic tissue
(Fig. 5D & Suppl. Fig. 2). Data for assessment of oxidative stress (given
in nmol per mg) was 1.23 ± 0.21 after i.v. NPC transplantation vs.
1.87 ± 0.25 in controls (p: 0.036), 1.29 ± 0.19 after i.a. NPC
transplantation vs. 2.14 ± 0.17 in controls (p: 0.022), and 1.05 ± 0.14
after ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC transplantation vs. 1.91 ± 0.31 in controls
(p: 0.027). Data for analysis of microglial activity (given in cells
per mm2) was 90.2 ± 56.9 after i.v. NPC transplantation vs. 205.0 ±

Leukocytosis (values given as cell numbers x103per μl), i.e., the number

3.6. Post-stroke neuroregeneration is not influenced by cell delivery routes
We next addressed the question whether or not neurological recovery
after systemic NPC delivery involves enhanced neuroregeneration
such as stimulation of angioneurogenesis (Fig. 6). Analysis of poststrokedifferentiation
of endogenous BrdU+cells within the ischemic lesion
site revealed expression of the neuronal markers Dcx and NeuN as
well as the endothelial marker CD31 in some of these cells. No significant
differences were observed between different transplantation
routes (Fig. 6A–B). Thus, NPC grafting did not induce post-stroke
angioneurogenesis. Likewise, the total number of CD31+ cells did not
differ between groups (Fig. 6C).
Since NPCs act via indirect bystander mechanisms thus modulating
the extracellular ischemic milieu, wefinally measured concentrations
of selected growth factors within the ischemic hemisphere 84 days
(Table 1). There were no significant changes, neither among different
NPC delivery routes nor between NPC-treated mice and corresponding
controls. These data suggest that long-term neuroprotection in this experimental
model is rather a consequence of acute neuroprotection and
BBB remodeling than a consequence of post-stroke neuroregeneration.
4. Discussion
With the best optimal cell delivery route still being unknown (Hicks
and Jolkkonen, 2009), the present study systematically analyzed effects
of six NPC delivery routes on post-stroke neurological recovery, brain injury
and mechanism of brain remodeling. Our data show that only systemic
delivery of native NPCs results in sustained reduction of brain
injury associated with neurological improvement, albeit intraarterial
cell delivery is associated with increased mortality of stroke mice in comparison
to the intravenous cell delivery route. On the contrary, local cell
delivery only induces transient neurological recovery and neuroprotection
when cells are directly grafted into the ischemic core lesion itself.
Local NPC grafts outside the ischemic lesion site did not have any effect.
Toour knowledge, only four studies existthatanalyzed effects of cell
administration routes in stroke (Du et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2010; Modo et al., 2002). Nevertheless, these studies are hampered due
to short survival periods (Du et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2005; Li et al., 2010)
and/or are descriptive in their nature (Modo et al., 2002). Whereas the
aforementioned studies are limited to three different injection sites, the
present study systematically analyzed six different NPC delivery routes.
As previously shown, neuroprotection due to local NPC grafting into
the ischemic lesion site strictly depends on cell numbers (Doeppner
et al., 2012a). Once within the post-ischemic milieu, these cells
act as mini-pumps, constantly secreting trophic factors and other mediators
and thus contribute to both neuroprotection and post-stroke
angioneurogenesis. The hostile post-ischemic milieu, however, favors
secondary cell death (Dirnagl et al., 1999; Hicks et al., 2008), ultimately
leading to a loss of therapeutic effect in the long run. In line with this,
local intrastriatal cell grafting of native NPCs only resulted in temporary
reduction of brain injury, since cell numbers gradually declined during
the observation period of three months, albeit absolute NPC numbers
were still significantly increased compared to other delivery routes in
the long run. Nevertheless, these few remaining cells are unlikely to be
integrated into the residing neural network and do not contribute to
neurological recovery. Similarly, contralateral cell grafting did not affect
post-stroke brain injury. The reason for the latter is again due to low
numbers of NPCs reaching the ischemic striatum, although a few cells indeed
migrated towards the ischemic lesion.
Despite reports onincreased contralateralendogenous neurogenesis
within the non-impaired hippocampal formation (Takasawa et al.,
2002) and reduction of functional impairment after contralateral
intrastriatal NPC transplantation, these studies do not necessarily contradict
the herein observed results. The former study focused on analyzing
endogenous neurogenesis in a model of permanent cerebral
ischemia. The latter study, however, did not use adult murine NPCs
but human embryonic NPCs, which might have different migration
properties. In contrast to local cell delivery, systemic NPC transplantation
achieves neuroprotection independent of intracerebral cell numbers
, as previously described by our group (Doeppner et al., 2012a,
2014). This goes along with a previous report from Borlongan et al. describing
that entering of grafted cells into the central nervous system
might not be necessary at all (Borlongan et al., 2004), although a more
recent report from the same group states that mannitol-enhanced cell

delivery might facilitate stem cell entry into the brain and thus increase
beneficial effects of stem cell treatment (Gonzales-Portillo et al., 2014).
Altogether, the mechanisms discussed after systemic NPC delivery
imply stabilization of the blood–brain-barrier as well as modulation of
post-stroke immune responses, all of which being mediated via indirect
paracrine mechanisms.
The experimental paradigm chosen for this study predominantly affects
the striatum, leaving the cortex unharmed. As such, a lack of NPC-
induced neuroprotection after intracortical transplantation might be
due to insufficient migration towards the stroke lesion. The hypothesis
of NPCs acting within a defined area is strengthened by the observation
that intracavitary transplantation of NPCs two weeks post-stroke stimulates
neurogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ but not in the contralateral
SVZ or the subgranular zones of the hippocampal formation (Jin et al.,
2011). Interestingly, stereotactic co-transplantation of cells with
matrigel scaffolding improves post-ischemic neurological outcomes in
rodents (Jin et al., 2010a,b), which might point towards migration deficits
once NPCs are transplanted without scaffolds.
Although intraarterial transplantation of NPCs proved to be as effective
as intravenous cell delivery, safety issues might hamper the clinical
use of this transplantation route. Reports on safety after intraarterial
transplantation of NPCs and even more so after mesenchymal stem
cell transplantation are still contradictory, with observations ranging
from successful recovery to increased mortality of test animals (Chua
et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2009; Karlupia et al., 2014; Li et al., 2001,
2010; Shen et al., 2006). A recent report by Chua and colleagues suggests
that mortality of stroke rodents after intraarterial NPC grafting is
reduced when cells are delivered via microneedles instead of catheters
(Chua et al., 2011). The value of this observation remains to be determined.
In terms of clinical feasibility and taken into account that intravenous
cell delivery proved to be non-inferior with comparable
neuroprotective properties, the intraarterial cell delivery route is clearly
less attractive. Our observations argue in favor of systemic NPC transplantation
and question the utility of local NPC transplantation remote
of the ischemic lesion site.
