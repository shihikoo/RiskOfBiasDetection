This article reviews the mechanisms of action of Actovegin in the context of its preclinical effects and new concepts
in the pharmacological treatment of neurological disorders. Actovegin is an ultrafiltrate of calf blood, composed
of more than 200 biological substances. The drug is used for a broad spectrum of diseases, including
disturbances of peripheral and cerebral blood circulation, burns, impaired wound healing, radiation-induced
damage and diabetic polyneuropathy. Actovegin is composed of small molecules present under normal physiological
conditions, therefore pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to determine its active substance
are not feasible. Preclinical data have revealed that it improves metabolic balance by increasing glucose uptake
and improving oxygen uptake under conditions of ischemia. Actovegin also resists the effects of gammairradiation
and stimulates wound healing. More recent preclinical studies have suggested that anti-oxidative
and anti-apoptotic mechanisms of action specifically underlie the neuroprotective properties of Actovegin. The
drug has been found to exert these beneficial effects experimentally, in primary rat hippocampal neurons and
in an STZ-rat model of diabetic polyneuropathy, while also providing evidence that it positively affects the functionalrecovery
of neurons.Latest data suggest thatActoveginalsohas a positive influence on theNF-κB pathway,
but many molecular and cellular pathways remain unexplored. In particular, Actovegin's influence on
neuroplasticity, neurogenesis and neurotrophicity are questions that ideally should be answered by future research.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the multifactorial and complex nature of Actovegin underlies its pleiotropic
neuroprotective mechanisms of action and positive effect on clinical outcomes.

1. Introduction
Currently, it is difficult tofind the optimum therapeutic approach
for brain protection and recovery, especially as we do not fully understand
all of the endogenous neurobiological processes and complete
nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, and the link
between the two. Moreover, we continue to use a simplistic approach
in this respect.
The reductionistic perception of the effects of brain lesions is that
they are the linear sum of independent pathology causing mechanisms,
such as excitotoxicity, inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress[1].
The classic concept of neuroprotection has developed the subtractive
suppressive strategy for neuroprotective therapies. The backbone of this
therapeutic strategy is the presumption that if a certain pathophysiological
mechanism is pharmacologically suppressed by a chemical drug, the
amount of damage caused by the specific mechanism will simply subtract
from the total amount created by all pathophysiological mechanisms.
However, what is clear from clinical trials in neuroprotection is that the
suppression subtractive strategy with chemical drugs does not work[2,3].
The current tendency to exclusively frame drug activity in terms of
single mechanisms and single focus effect may distract from other paradigms
with greater explanatory power and hinder the development of
more effective treatment strategies. A change of concept is required in
pharmacological brain protection and recovery. The current understanding
is that neurotrophicity, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity and
neurogenesis are the fundamental neurobiological processes that contribute
to endogenous defense activity (EDA) and attempt to counteract
pathophysiological damage mechanisms (DMs), and stimulate endogenous
recovery (Fig. 1)[4].
The key issue in the new theory of brain protection and recovery is
that the neurobiological processes of EDA share a common biological
background with the pathophysiological mechanisms of DM. For example
, excitotoxicity (a pathophysiological mechanism) and neuroplasticity
(a neuroreparatory process) share N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
(NMDAR) activity as their common important driver. Therefore, when
one acute pathophysiological process is pharmacologically suppressed
(e.g. excitotoxicity or inflammation) by a single mechanism chemical
drug, the long-term endogenous drivers of recovery (e.g. neuroplasticity
and neurotrophicity) are also disturbed [1].
Consequently, it is not appropriate to approach pharmacological
neuroprotection and neurorecovery separately, because this dichotomy

might mislead basic and clinical research in thefield. In fact, in clinical
practice, a complex recovery outcome is evaluated, which is generated
by all of the protection and recovery processes of EDA in an inseparable
way[1].
Prospective considerations include an integrated pharmacological
approach, focusing on agents with multimodal activity and pleiotropic
neuroprotective effects which are biological drugs, rather than
single mechanism drugs — which are usually chemically designed
small molecules [5].
Actovegin is a deproteinized, endotoxin and antigen-free, ultrafiltrate
from calf blood, which contains more than 200 bioactive constituents.
The manufacturing process of Actovegin is both lengthy and
complex and involves two ultrafiltration steps, which make use of different
molecular mass cut-off sieves. During the production process, a
cut-off sieve of 5000 Da is first used, followed by vacuum distillation
removal of the remaining precipitate byfiltration (0.45 μm) and titration
to pH 6.4. One further ultrafiltration step followed by sterilefiltration
with prefilters of 0.2 μmand0.45μm, complete deproteinization of
the product, which isfinally tested negative for the presence of protein
by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of
components in thefinal ultrafiltrate is less than 5000 Da.
The composition of Actovegin has been re-analyzed using stateof-the-art
analytical techniques, including gas chromatography and
validated high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS). These metabolite-targeted quantification
techniques (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria)
demonstrated that Actovegin contains a combination of more than
200 bioactive–molecules. Actovegin's main constituents are lowmolecular
weight substances, including amino acids, biogenic amines
and polyamines, sphingolipids, hexoses, eicosanoids, lactate, succinate,
choline, vitamins, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inositol
phospho-oligosaccharides (IPOs). Only small amounts of acylcarnitines,
phospholipids, free fatty acids, and oxysterols have been detected;
prostaglandins, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, and bile acids
are present in even smaller amounts (data onfile).
Owing to the fact that Actovegin is a biological drug consisting of
molecules present under normal physiological conditions, pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic studies to determine its active molecule
(s) are not feasible. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the drug has
many active components that influence numerous intracellular processes
, and experimental studies have confirmed that Actovegin
influences specific cellular biochemical pathways. However, associations
between the multiple molecular mechanisms and beneficial
effects in vitro and in vivo remain only partly understood.
2. In vitro and in vivo effects of Actovegin
In early preclinical studies, Actovegin has been shown to influence
the wound healing process by stimulation of cell growth including
collagen synthesis and matrix contraction [6,7]. Actovegin also has
beneficial, regenerative effects in the treatment of radiation-induced
damage [8], as well as in disturbances of blood circulation [9,10].
However, most recently, its neuroprotective effects on related distinct
pathophysiological cellular pathways have been examined closely.
Actovegin was recently demonstrated to have neuroprotective
effects on neurons by increasing neuron and synaptic numbers. In an
in vitro study [11], hippocampal neurons were isolated from rat brains
and cultured under optimized conditions in the presence of different
concentrations of Actovegin (0.3–1000 μg/mL). Cultured hippocampal
neurons normally undergo a rapid decline due to apoptosis. However,
after ten days in culture, a dose-dependent increase in the number
of viable neurons of up to 2.4-fold was measured at concentrations
above 10 μg/mL of Actovegin, compared to untreated neurons. In parallel
, the number of excitatory synaptic connections between the neurons
was measured by expression of a marker protein of pre-synaptic terminals
, VGlut1. Analysis of VGlut1 using immunohistochemistry also
revealed a dose-dependent increase of up to 3.6-fold per cell, induced
by Actovegin at doses greater than 300 μg/mL.
Neuroprotective effects of Actovegin have also been observed in
the peripheral nervous system in streptozotocin (STZ)-rats with severe
symptoms of diabetic neuropathy [12]. By treating diabetic rats
with intraperitoneal Actovegin with a dose equivalent to the human
dose used in the clinical treatment of patients with distal peripheral
neuropathy, the diabetes-induced degeneration of peripheral neurons
was significantly decelerated. Beneficial effects of Actovegin
were reflected by histomorphological improvements, i.e. an increase
of 32% in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in rat paws by
Actovegin treatment, at study end. Furthermore, a significant improvement
in peripheral nerve functionality, i.e. a reversal in the
decline of sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), of up to 91%
was detected in rats treated with Actovegin. N-acetyl-cysteine was

used as a positive control and interestingly, was not effective in this
respect.
3. Actovegin modifies glucose uptake and aerobic metabolism in
the brain
Preclinical studies have shown that at the molecular level,
Actovegin improves oxygen utilization and uptake, as well as energy
metabolism and glucose uptake[13–15]. Glucose is the primary energy
source for the brain and in the CNS, glucose transporters play an
essential role in neuronal homeostasis and glucose utilization
[16–18]. Disruption of glucose homeostasis in the CNS leads to impairment
of neuronal activity and cognitive function, which is particularly
threatening to the hippocampus, the brain area important for
learning and memory. Insulin receptors and insulin-sensitive glucose
transporters, e.g. GLUT4, are crucial for glucose uptake and utilization
in the CNS. They are expressed in brain areas such as the hypothalamus
and cerebellum [19], as well as on the endothelium of the
blood–brain barrier [20]. Basic and clinical research findings have
demonstrated a clear relationship between brain insulin levels and
cognitive functions, including learning and memory [21]. For
instance, impairment of neuronal insulin receptor transduction has
been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease. Hoyer and colleagues
have induced severe abnormalities in oxidative energy metabolism
by intracerebroventricular administration of a diabetogenic agent
into the brain, and found that it was associated with behavioral
disturbances [22–24]. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis
of Salkovic-Petrisic and Hoyer [25] that an insulin-resistant
state in the brain may have an impact on the cellular and molecular
abnormalities seen in Alzheimer's disease.
Actovegin has positive effects on the utilization of glucose and
oxygen, thereby enhancing energy metabolism in the brain. It was
described that inositol phospho-oligosaccharides may play an importantrole
in the regulation ofinsulin-dependent enzymes[26,27]. Experimentally
, Actovegin has demonstrated increased oxygen uptake and
utilization [28], which can lead to the stabilization of CNS cells during
ischemia, and reduce the formation of lactate. It also up-regulates glucose
transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, which in cerebrovascular disorders
may translate into an improvement of glucose transport across
the blood–brain barrier.
The parietal cortex is responsible for processing visual information
and spatial-directed attention, while shrinkage of this area leads to
dementia. It has appeared from clinical studies, that Actovegin improves
cognitive processing in the parietal cortex in age-associated
memory impairment, which may be associated with its positive influence
on hypoxic states[29]. In line with these clinicalfindings, Hoyer
and Betz[30]showed that Actovegin provides cellular protection in a
hypoxia model of cerebral ischemia.
4. Amelioration of Aβ
25–35
peptide-induced apoptosis
Amyloid β-peptides (Aβs) are the main component of amyloid
plaques, which are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
The neurotoxic peptides increase oxidative stress and activate inflammatory
pathways, ultimately causing neuronal cell death [31]. However
, Aβ fragments vary significantly in terms of their pathological
properties. For example, the Aβ
25–35
fragment is highly toxic [32,33]
and has more rapid aggregation properties than other commonly
studied amyloid peptides [34]. These properties have been reflected
in studies using animal models where Aβ
25–35
impaired short-term
memory, and induced neuropathological processes, resulting in neuronal
cell death [35,36]. There is a suggestion that the cytotoxic and
abnormal aggregative properties of Aβ
25–35
underlie its neurodegenerative
properties in Alzheimer's disease and other disorders, but further
work is needed in order to fully elucidate this.
In a recent study investigating the potential mode of action of
Actovegin, Aβ
25–35
peptides were used to test whether or not it has
an anti-apoptotic effect on neuronal cells in vitro [11]. Rat primary
hippocampal neurons were cultivated with Aβ
25–35
, in the presence
of Actovegin, to measure the levels of activated caspase-3 on a
per-cell basis, reflecting the degree of neuronal apoptosis. In the absence
of Aβ
25–35
peptides, levels of apoptosis were similar in both
Actovegin-treated and untreated cells. In hippocampal neurons
exposed to Aβ
25–35
peptides and treated with increasing doses of
Actovegin, the level of activated caspase-3 decreased significantly
(pb0.001 at Actovegin concentrations>300 μg/mL) and followed a
trend towards dose-dependency [11].
Since there is evidence to suggest that the Aβ
25–35
peptide plays a
key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and it has been
characterized in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease [37],
the amelioration of apoptosis induced by this peptide extends our understanding
of Actovegin-mediated mechanisms of neuroprotection.
5. NF-κB pathway activation by Actovegin
The transcription factor NF-κB has wide-ranging and important
roles within the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems.
Specifically, NF-κB regulates inflammatory processes that exacerbate
diseases such as ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, and plays a role
in pain, learning and memory, and importantly, neuroprotection
[38–41]. Regulation of NF-κB activity is complicated by the fact that
numerous pathways can either upregulate or downregulate its activity
, resulting in varying effects, in different tissues.
The involvement of NF-κB in neuroprotective pathways is mediated
by pro-inflammatory cytokines[42]. It has been shown that treatment
of primary hippocampal neurons with tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) prevents hypoxia and nitric oxide-induced neuronal cell
death, through the elevation of NF-κB-dependent expression of the
anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-x[43]. However, it has been found
that TNF-α may also induce neuronal apoptosis and trigger degenerative
processes[44], while soluble TNF receptor-1 has been demonstrated
to induce apoptosis in monocytes[45]. In vivo, it was demonstrated
that TNF-αpretreatment in rats with focal ischemia reduced brain injury[46], while transgenic TNF receptor knock-out mice presented larger
infarctions[47]. This phenomenon could be explained by the existence
of two TNF receptor types: R1—inducing demyelination and increasing
cell death, and R2 — inducing remyelination and mediating neuroprotection
by activation of oligodendrocytes through BDNF and CNTF
[5,48].
Other work supporting a role for the neuroprotective properties of
NF-κB suggests it protects against neuronal cell death in the presence
of Aβ, and may therefore influence apoptotic pathways [40,49].
Rodent models have also shown that downregulation of inhibitory
kappa beta (IκB), a central component of the NF-κB signaling pathway,

results in the loss of neuroprotection and can lead to defects in learning
and memory[50].
Hundsberger and Pflüger (FH Krems, Austria) have conducted a
novel study in vitro to investigate the potential of Actovegin to modulate
the NF-κB pathway. For their experimental system, the investigators
chose the well-established CellSensor® human embryonic
kidney cell line, NF-κB-bla HEK 293T, which contains a stably transfectedβ-lactamase reporter gene under control of the NF-κB response
element. In order to exclude osmotic side effects of Actovegin in
the cells, a placebo solution with a salt concentration equimolar to
Actovegin was used. Measurement offluorescence emission revealed
that Actovegin activates the reporter gene of NF-κB expression in a
dose-dependent manner (Table 1; unpublished observations). The
effective concentration corresponded to the stimulatory effectiveness
of a TNF-α concentration of approximately 400 pg/mL. Coupled with
the results of Elmlinger et al. [11] these data suggest that the
neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties of Actovegin can at
least in part be attributed to transient activation of NF-κB.
6. Anti-oxidative stress and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase pathway
Oxidative stress-induced single-strand DNA breakage can lead to
the activation of the nuclear enzyme, PARP. PARP plays a key role in
the detection and repair of single-strand DNA breaks, but it has
been shown that excessive activation of the enzyme is detrimental;
it can trigger a sequence of cellular processes, which ultimately halt
glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, resulting in cell death arising
due to energy depletion [51,52].
Experimental studies have shown that the disruption of genes coding
for PARP protects rodents from a range of pathophysiological processes
[52–54]. PARP gene disruption has been found to offer significant protection
to neurons following focal ischemia [52] and prevents the progression
or appearance of diabetes following STZ induction [53,54].Further
work has identified PARP as an important pathway of endothelial dysfunction
in diabetes [55] and more recently it has been shown that
PARP may underlie the development of diabetic polyneuropathy; PARP
inhibition in rats protects against a reduction in nerve conduction velocities [56]. Taken together, these data suggest an important and fundamental
role of PARP in chronic disorders such as cerebrovascular
disease and diabetic polyneuropathy.
Work by Elmlinger and colleagues found that oxidative stress in
primary hippocampal neurons is positively affected by Actovegin,
as tested using a fluorescence-based assay system (proportional to
total reactive oxygen species (ROS) content). Neurons treated with
increasing concentrations of tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)
(>0.2 mM) exhibited increased intracellular ROS levels (pb0.001),
but treatment with Actovegin dose-dependently reduced oxidative
stress in neurons after 10 days of culture (pb0.001 at concentrations
>0.3 μg/mL) [11].
An investigation into the effects of Actovegin on parameters of
experimental diabetic polyneuropathy has corroborated the findings
of this study. STZ diabetic rats, which were administered Actovegin
intraperitoneally from day 11 to day 40 post-STZ exposure, had significantly reduced PARP activity, at an Actovegin dose of 600 mg/kg,
as measured by poly(ADP-ribose) content [12]. The reduction in
PARP activity may underlie the functional and morphological improvements
observed with Actovegin in the peripheral and central
nervous systems, as mentioned earlier. The data obtained from
these two studies also suggest that the anti-oxidative properties of
Actovegin underpin its effects on PARP activation, but further
research is needed in order to verify this.
7. Discussion
The data reviewed above describe how Actovegin improves cellular
metabolic balance and influences a number of mechanisms
implicated in different disorders. Since neurological disorders are
underpinned by a complex array of pathophysiological events, an integrated
pharmacological approach, rather than a simplistic one, may
be required to effectively treat them. As a biological agent with pleiotropic
neuroprotective and metabolic effects (Table 2), Actovegin's
mode of action fits this future vision of an integrated treatment
paradigm.
The pleiotropic neuroprotective effect describes different simultaneous
ways to modulate pathological mechanisms of DM (excitotoxicity,
inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and more). In contrast, a
single-mechanism molecule is only able to suppress one pathophysiological
mechanism. The pleiotropic neuroprotective and metabolic effects of
Actovegin's mode of action have been briefly described in this article.
Actovegin has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects on
the neurovascular unit due to its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects.
Positive effects have also been demonstrated on the utilization of glucose
and oxygen, thereby enhancing energy metabolism in the brain. A simple
diagram describing the pleiotropic neuroprotective and metabolic effects
of Actovegin is depicted in Fig. 2. Further effects on other endogenous

neurobiological processes such as neurotrophicity, neuroplasticity and
neurogenesis are yet to be fully explored in future studies.
8. Conclusions
Actovegin is composed of more than 200 biological constituents,
which influence many intracellular processes and pathways. A range
of findings have revealed possible mechanisms of action underlying
the neuroprotective and metabolic effects of Actovegin; it has been
shown to modulate the activation of NF-κB, reduce apoptosis, inhibit
PARP and positively affect both glucose and oxygen utilization. However
, the effects of Actovegin on other potential pathways involving
neurotrophicity, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis still remain to be
investigated. Nevertheless, the complex composition of the drug,
which has biological origin, underlies its pleiotropic neuroprotective
and metabolic mode of action.
