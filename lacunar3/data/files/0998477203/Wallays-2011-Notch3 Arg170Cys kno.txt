Notch3 Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Display Pathologic and
Clinical Features of the Neurovascular Disorder Cerebral
Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy With Subcortical
Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy

Objective—Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an
adult-onset neurovascular disorder caused by stereotyped mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor. Elucidation of its
pathobiology is still incomplete and remains a challenge, in part because the available preclinical mouse models to date
do not reproduce the full spectrum of CADASIL pathology and clinical disease.
Methods and Results—Here, we report a novel knock-in mouse with Arg170Cys substitution in murine Notch3,
corresponding to the prevalent Arg169Cys substitution in CADASIL. The Notch3Arg170Cys mice displayed late-onset,
dominant CADASIL arteriopathy with typical granular osmiophilic material deposition and developed brain histopathology
including thrombosis, microbleeds, gliosis, and microinfarction. Furthermore, Notch3Arg170Cys mice experienced
neurological symptoms with motor defects such as staggering gait and limb paresis.
Conclusion—This model, for the first time, phenocopies the arteriopathy and the histopathologic as well as clinical features
of CADASIL and may offer novel opportunities to investigate disease pathogenesis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

Key Words: cerebrovascular disorders  gene mutations  CADASIL  Notch3  arteriopathy
Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an
adult-onset autosomal dominant neurovascular disorder.1–3
The main symptoms are migraine with aura, psychiatric
disturbances, and recurrent subcortical ischemic strokes causing
motor disabilities, cognitive decline, dementia, and premature
death.2,3 The accompanying arteriopathy is characterized
by the progressive degeneration of arterial smooth
muscle cells (SMCs), deposition of electron-dense granular
osmiophilic material (GOM) within the basal lamina of the
SMCs and pericytes, and accumulation of the Notch3 extracellular
cleavage product at the SMC membrane.2–7 Although
the arteriopathy is systemic,8 the symptoms are mostly
neurological. Brain pathology involves microbleeds, loss of
myelin or axons, fibrillar gliosis, and lacunar infarcts in the
white and deep gray matter.2,3,9
CADASIL is caused by mutations in the transmembrane
receptor Notch3, which is predominantly expressed in adult
arterial SMCs.10–13 Pathogenic mutations stereotypically affect
the number of cysteine residues in the epidermal growth
factor–like repeats of the extracellular domain (ECD).13–15
Thus far, more than 180 mutations are known, nearly 60% of
which cluster in exon 4.3,13–16In vitro and in vivo studies have
highlighted a role of Notch3 in artery maturation, responses
to vascular injury or ischemia, and regulation of SMC
proliferation and apoptosis.17–25 How the various Notch3
mutations effectuate arteriopathy and CADASIL disease
development remains enigmatic.
Previous approaches to generating a model of CADASIL
include knock-in mice carrying the counterpart Arg141Cys
CADASIL mutation (Arg142Cys in mouse) in the endogenous
Notch3 gene, which failed, however, to develop any
phenotype at all.26 On the other hand, transgenic overexpression
in mice of human or rat Notch3 carrying archetypal
Notch3 mutations (Arg90Cys human Notch3,27–30 Cys428Ser
human Notch3,31 Arg169Cys rat Notch3,32 Cys455Arg and
Arg1031Cys human Notch333) met with more success, with
all models displaying the CADASIL arteriopathy. However,

only 1 of them (Arg169Cys rat Notch3) developed brain
histopathology, albeit limited to leukoaraiosis and astrogliosis
,32 and none of the models developed neurological
symptoms.7,33,34
Here, we report a novel mutant mouse carrying an
Arg170Cys knock-in mutation in the endogenous murine
Notch3 that, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the first
model comprising both CADASIL histopathology and clinical
disease.
Methods
Generation of the Mice
For details on the generation, genotyping, and expression analysis of
the Arg170Cys knock-in mice, see the supplemental material,
available online at http://atvb.ahajournals.org. Experimental mice
were littermates from heterozygous breeding (genetic background
overall 50% 129EvSv:50% Swiss). Given the dominant phenotype
(see below), experiments were done with heterozygous or homozygous
mice, except for expression analyses, which were consistently
performed with material from homozygous mutant mice. This study
was approved by the ethical committee for animal experimentation
of the University of Leuven, Belgium.
Phenotypic Analysis
Expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase
chain reaction and by Western blotting was as described in the
supplemental material. Notch3 signaling functionality was evaluated
by target expression analysis in brain tissue and in vitro in an
activation assay using cocultures of embryonic fibroblasts derived
from wild-type and mutant embryos, with human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (see supplemental material). Tissue preparation and
(immuno)histochemical analysis, vascular morphometric analysis,
and ultrastructural analysis of brain and peripheral tissues are
detailed in the supplemental material.
Mice were monitored during aging for spontaneous motor abnormalities
(reduced spontaneous mobility, tremor, ataxia as observed
by staggering gait, and limb paresis as observed by dragging of a
limb when stimulated to walk on a tabletop).
Arterial remodeling or regrowth was assessed in the lung during
pulmonary hypertension35 and in the skin during healing of a
full-thickness skin wound,36as detailed in the supplemental material.
Behavioral testing was performed using cognitive and anxiety/
exploratory tests (elevated plus maze, open field exploration, social
exploration, passive avoidance test, contextual fear conditioning,
radial maze test) as described.37,38
Statistical Analysis
Data represent meanSEM. Statistical significance was calculated
by the Student t test or by the Fisher exact test, considering P0.05
as statistically significant.
Results
Generation, Viability, and Fertility of Arg170Cys
Mutant Knock-In Mice
Introduction of an Arg170Cys substitution in murine Notch3,
corresponding to the prevalent CADASIL Arg169Cys substitution
,14 was achieved by knock-in of the corresponding
CGT-to-TGT mutation in exon 4 of the murine gene (Supplemental
Figure IA and IB). The resulting mutant mice had
normal expression levels of the mutant Notch3 and did not
compensatorily upregulate other Notch receptors (Supplemental
Note I and Supplemental Table I). The mutant mice displayed
normal growth, viability, and fertility (data not shown). Given
the dominant effect of the mutation in our model (see below and
Supplemental Note II), heterozygous and homozygous mice are
collectively named Notch3Arg170Cys mice.
Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Develop Cerebral and
Systemic CADASIL Arteriopathy With
GOM Deposition
To verify whether the Notch3Arg170Cys mice developed the
typical ultrastructural abnormalities of CADASIL arteriopathy
, brains of aged mice were analyzed by electron microscopy.
Mice20 months old (9 Notch3Arg170Cys mice and 5
wild-type littermate controls) were analyzed to maximize the
likelihood of disease development. Typical abnormalities
were observed in Notch3Arg170Cys mice but not wild-type
littermates (Figure 1). GOM deposits in the basal lamina of
the SMCs and surrounding matrix, a hallmark of CADASIL,
were found (Figure 1A and 1C–1E). GOM was frequently
located in indentations of the SMC membrane (Figure 1D and
1E), which was often associated with abundance of caveolae
and endosomal vesicles (Figure 1E), as reported in CADASIL
patients.27,39 We occasionally also observed GOM-like material
inside caveolae (Figure 1F). Enlargement of the subendothelial
space (Figure 1G), enlargement of the SMC intercellular
space, and the presence of a multilayered endothelial
basement membrane (Figure 1G and 1H) was seen, as also
reported in CADASIL.4,40 SMC and endothelial cell vacuolization
, indicating cellular degeneration, and occasional SMC
necrosis were also observed (Figure 1D and data not shown).
These CADASIL-like ultrastructural abnormalities2,4,7,34,40
were found in 67% (6 of 9) of the mutant mice analyzed at
this age but never in wild-type littermates (n5) (Figure 1B).
They were most easily detected in the brain slices corresponding
to2 mm on either side of bregma. No abnormalities
were seen in Notch3Arg170Cysmice analyzed at the age of
4 to 5 months (n4; data not shown).
Unlike the case in CADASIL patients and most of the other
mouse models,3,5,27,31,32 we did not obtain evidence for
accumulation of the Notch3 ectodomain (by Western blotting
for Notch3 ECD and Notch3 intracellular domain; Supplemental
Figure IC).
Arteriopathy in CADASIL patients is systemic, allowing
diagnosis by skin biopsy analysis.4 In accordance with this,
we also observed ultrastructural abnormalities in tail arteries
in Notch3Arg170Cys mice (Supplemental Figure II). This peripheral
arteriopathy was observed from 8 to 9 months
onward in 67% (4 of 6) of the mutants, equaling the incidence
of arteriopathy observed in the brain.
Thus, Notch3Arg170Cys mice displayed typical CADASIL
ultrastructural abnormalities in cerebral and peripheral vessels.
The arteriopathy was detected in both females and males
and regardless of homo- or heterozygosity (see Supplemental
Note II), indicating a dominant effect of the mutation, as in
CADASIL.2,3,41
Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Display
CADASIL-Like Brain Histopathology
To define whether the mutant mice developed the cerebral
histopathology observed in CADASIL, histopathologic analysis
was carried out on a large group of mice (n73), again
at more advanced age (20–22 months) to maximize detection

of cerebral events. Abnormalities were detected in 23% (17)
of the Notch3Arg170Cys mice but not in wild-type brains
(n19) (for overview of incidence and features, see Supplemental
Table II). Brain abnormalities included perivascular
microbleeds (12%) (Figure 2A and 2B); hemosiderin deposits
or hemosiderin-containing macrophages (visible by Perl’s
iron staining), indicating previous microbleeds42 (5.5%) (Figure
2C); perivascular inflammatory infiltrates (CD45; data
not shown) (8%) (Figure 2D and 2E), which have been
reported in some CADASIL cases43; gliosis (3%), as evidenced
by glial fibrillary acidic protein staining, sometimes
correlating with an area of microbleeding (Figure 2F and 2G);
and thrombosis (7%) and perivascular fibrin(ogen) depositions
(3%) (Figure 2H and data not shown). Notably, in 9 of
73 (12%) Notch3Arg170Cys mice, distinct parenchymal lesions
were seen, including microinfarctions characterized by foci
with pallor and cell loss around small cystic cavities (5 mice)
(Figure 2I–2L). Enlargement of the Virchow-Robin spaces
creating perivascular lacunae, which is also frequently detected
in CADASIL,44was also found (Figure 2M and 2N and
data not shown). All microinfarctions detected were located
in the motor cortex area (primary [M1] motor area [4 mice] or
supplementary [M2] motor area [1 mouse]) (Figure 2I–2L).
All abnormalities were located within the area spanning
2.5 mm anterior to 2 mm posterior to the bregma
(Supplemental Table II).
Given the systemic nature of the arteriopathy in the
Notch3Arg170Cys mice, extracerebral organs were analyzed for
pathological signs (kidney, liver, heart, lung); however, this
analysis revealed no overt abnormalities (data not shown).
Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Display Motor Defects
Clinical manifestations of CADASIL include recurrent ischemic
episodes frequently causing a classic lacunar syndrome,
leading to motor disability.34,41 We therefore monitored the
same group of 73 Notch3Arg170Cys mice up to 22 months of
age for signs of motor impairment. Because variations in
body weight among the mice were relative large at advanced
age (eg, weight range of 35–55 g at 18 months) and
influenced specific motor performance tests (eg, no differences
were observed between genotypes in a grid wire
hanging test or turnover test45 after correction for body
weight; data not shown), monitoring was restricted to directly
observable spontaneously occurring disabilities. Nine mice
(12%) developed overt permanent motor disability, ataxia, or
both (Supplemental Table II). Eight of them had paresis of 1
or more limbs, as observed by dragging of the affected
limb(s) during movement. Three mice showed staggering
ataxic gait. The earliest onset of motor defects observed was
13 months. Among the affected mutant mice, only 2 displayed
obvious cerebral pathology on analysis after euthanization
(Supplemental Table II). Notably, this involved mice
with microinfarction in the motor area of the right (M2 area)
or left (M1 area) hemisphere (Figure 2I and 2J and data not
shown), which displayed paresis of the left or right hindlimb,
respectively. No loss of motor function was observed in 19
wild-type littermates monitored in parallel.

performance, a typical symptom in CADASIL patients,41,46

showed largely normal performance of aged Notch3Arg170Cys
mice apart from somewhat reduced exploratory behavior
(Supplemental Note III and Supplemental Figure III).
Thus, the Arg170Cys-associated pathology presented with
neurological consequences affecting motor ability, reminiscent
of the motor decline observed in CADASIL patients.
Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Retain Normal
Receptor Signaling
To evaluate functionality of the Arg170Cys mutant Notch3,
expression of target genes (Hey1, Hey2, Nrarp, HeyL) was
analyzed23,33 in murine embryonic fibroblasts, derived from
wild-type and homozygous mutant embryos and cultured in
the absence and presence of Jagged1-expressing human
umbilical vein endothelial cells to induce the Notch pathway.23Coculture of the fibroblasts with human umbilical vein
endothelial cells caused a moderate increase of Notch3
expression (1.37-fold in wild-type and somewhat higher,
2.6-fold, in the mutant fibroblasts), in line with previous
reports.23 However, coculture with human umbilical vein
endothelial cells induced Notch targets to a more pronounced
level (as much as10-fold). Induction in mutant fibroblasts
was somewhat reduced for Hey2 and HeyL but equal to or
surpassing that in wild-type fibroblasts for the other tested
targets, Hey1 and Nrarp (Figure 3A). Furthermore, no differences
in target mRNA expression (Hey1, Hey2, Nrarp, Hes1,
HeyL, Hes5) were observed in brain extracts of aged mice (20
months) (Figure 3B). Thus, the Arg170Cys substitution in
mouse Notch3 did not affect signaling, in accordance with
previous observations with the counterpart mutation in rat
Notch3, which was shown to display normal surface expression
, ligand binding, and signaling.34,47

defects might be present, however, as suggested by the SMC
vacuolization and SMC necrosis seen by electron microscopy
(see above).
Notch3 has been implicated in the development of pulmonary
hypertension and associated remodeling of the small
pulmonary arteries.22 To further assess a potential impact of
the Arg170Cys mutation on SMC responses, we exposed
Notch3Arg170Cys mice to chronic normobaric hypoxia (10%

) for 28 days and assessed pulmonary artery remodeling by
quantification of partially and fully muscularized small peripheral
lung vessels.35 Wild-type and Notch3Arg170Cys mice
(aged 3–4 months) exposed to hypoxia developed right
ventricular hypertrophy as indicated by the 1.7-fold increase
in the ratio of the mass of the right ventricle to that of the left
ventricle plus septum as compared with normoxia exposure
(Figure 3C). This was associated with pulmonary arterial
remodeling as revealed by the up to 3.3-fold higher fraction
of completely muscularized vessels, from10% in normoxia
to30% in hypoxia (Table). No differences were observed,
however, between wild-type and mutant mice (Table), indi-

We also subjected aged mice (12–13 months) to a skin
wound healing model36 and evaluated the wound healing
response and associated vessel regeneration. Healing of a
full-thickness incision wound inflicted on the back of the
mice progressed similarly in wild-type and mutant mice, as
indicated by comparable wound closure rates (Figure 3D).
Immunostaining of skin wound sections 14 days after wounding
revealed comparable numbers of SMC-actinvessels in
the wound area and in the border zones in samples from
Notch3Arg170Cys mice as compared with the wild-type controls
(Figure 3E). Total blood vessel density (CD31 staining)
in the wound and border zone also did not differ between
genotypes (Figure 3F).
Joutel et al recently reported capillary rarefaction in the
cortex and corpus callosum in their mouse model with
transgenic expression of mutant Arg169Cys rat Notch3, at
stages before white matter lesion.32 We therefore compared
capillary densities in the brain of Notch3Arg170Cys and wildtype
control mice aged 12 to 13 months (after onset of
arteriopathy) as well as in mice aged 20 to 22 months and
with confirmed brain pathology, including mice with parenchymal
pallor and loss. In both age groups, cortical capillary
densities did not differ significantly between mutant and
wild-type mice (CD31capillary density in number per mm2:
2429.5 for Notch3Arg170Cys mice versus 26417 for wildtype
mice at 12–13 months and 28322 for Notch3Arg170Cys
mice versus 33017 for wild-type mice at 20–22 months;
meanSEM, Pnot significant between genotypes).
Thus, cerebral arterioles and capillaries appeared grossly
normal, and neither young nor aged Notch3Arg170Cys mice
displayed overt impairment of SMC responses in selected
models of vascular repair or remodeling.
Discussion
Here, we generated a mouse model of CADASIL arteriopathy
and clinical disease by introducing an Arg170Cys substitution
in murine Notch3, corresponding to the prevalent
Arg169Cys substitution in CADASIL patients.14,48 This
knock-in approach resulted in unperturbed expression levels
in the Notch3Arg170Cys mice and allowed direct comparative
phenotyping of mutant and wild-type control littermates.
Arteriopathy was observed in both the brain and peripheral
sites (tail) in Notch3Arg170Cys mice and was characterized by
typical GOM deposition and enlargement of endothelial subcellular
and SMC intercellular space. Histological analysis of the
brain revealed microbleeds, thrombosis, fibrillar gliosis, and
microinfarction, all typical features in CADASIL.8,9,11,49 As in
CADASIL,34,41 neurological consequences affecting motor
ability (ataxia, paresis) were observed. Additional similarities
with CADASIL and the Notch3Arg170Cys mouse mutant phenotype
were the late onset, with hallmarks of arteriopathy
observed at around 8 months (after not being present at 4 to
5 months) and the earliest signs of motor decline at 13
months, and the dominant nature of the disease.
As in CADASIL, electron microscopy of the Notch3Arg170Cys
mice revealed the presence of typical GOM-like material in
the basal lamina and membrane enfoldings of the SMCs6,27,39
but also inside caveolae. The latter, to the best of our
knowledge, has not been reported before, although recently,
intracellular GOM-like inclusions were observed in the
Cys455Arg and Arg1031Cys human Notch3 transgenic models.33 It is tempting to speculate that these findings may
reflect stages of GOM development33 or may relate to a
postulated defective ubiquitin-dependent (trans)endocytosis
of mutant Notch3.16,39,50,51 The latter is a plausible scenario,
implying the presence of Notch3 ECD in GOM. This remains
controversial, however, as the detection of Notch3 ECD in
GOM by immunoelectron microscopy on patient material
was not confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis.33,52 Interestingly
, in vitro studies showed that CADASIL-mutant but
not wild-type Notch3 ECD fragments can spontaneously
form multimer aggregates, in which other proteins can
coaggregate.53 This aggregation could contribute to the observed
Notch3 ECD accumulation in CADASIL and might
sequester potentially critical factors by coaggregation.33,53
Unlike in CADASIL and in other CADASIL mouse models
,7,27,31 we did not obtain evidence for overt Notch3 ECD
accumulation in the Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in mice using a
commercially available antibody. Whether and how such
accumulation is critical for disease development remains to
be investigated.34
Common to several CADASIL mutations and to findings
in other CADASIL models,16,18,27,30,32 the Notch3Arg170Cys
knock-in mice developed CADASIL-like pathology in the
absence of Notch signaling defects. These data are in line
with the prevailing hypothesis that the effect of Notch3
mutation in CADASIL may be largely based on a neomorphic
function rather than on altered signaling,2,7,18,31,32,34 without
excluding the fact that reduced signaling reported for specific
mutations can modify and further aggravate disease.7,31,33
Unique so far to the Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in model is the
development of multiple features of CADASIL brain pathology
, including the occurrence of microinfarctions, creating
small cavities, and the development of neurological symptoms
(Supplemental Table II). Among the previously reported
models, the Arg169Cys rat Notch3 transgenic model develops
some of the same parenchymal pathology, primarily
comprising leukoaraiosis and astrogliosis but not lacunar
infarcts and possibly reflecting presymptomatic disease
stage.7,32 Interestingly, these Arg169Cys rat Notch3 transgenic
mice display white matter capillary rarefaction, which
together with cerebrovascular dysfunction has been proposed
to lead to the cerebral hypoperfusion observed in these mice
and which possibly contributes to the white matter alterations.7,28,32,34 The normal capillary densities observed in this
study in aged Notch3Arg170Cys brains, including those from
mice with confirmed brain pathology, suggests that capillary
rarefaction may be an important contributing factor but
possibly not a general event in mouse models of CADASIL-
like disease.
Notch3Arg170Cys mice experienced CADASIL-like neurological
consequences affecting motor ability, including mice
with microinfarction in the motor area displaying paresis of
the contralateral hindlimb. In contrast, none of the other
models reported so far developed neurological symptoms,

despite marked overexpression of the mutant receptor in
several of these transgenic lines.7,27,31–34 Data obtained with
the Cys455Arg human Notch3 transgenic model linked this
particular hypomorphic mutation to susceptibility to stroke,
but the mice did not develop spontaneous infarcts.33 The
absence of brain pathology and neurological consequences in
the other CADASIL mouse models was accounted for by
potential differences between human and mouse cerebral
vasculature, brain architecture, and vulnerability or by the
short life span of mice, limiting disease development to its
earlier stages.7,32 Although such factors might well be influencing
disease outcome, the Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in mouse
model demonstrates that CADASIL-like pathology and clinical
disease can develop within the life span of this species
and without requiring enhanced expression of the mutant
protein.
One observation on the Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in model is
the incomplete penetrance of the neurological and the brain
histopathologic phenotype despite occurrence of the typical
CADASIL arteriopathy in the majority of the mice. This
finding suggests that arteriopathy does not cause pathological
and neurological consequences per se but that modifying
factors, yet to be identified, may critically influence disease
development or progression. Also, the reason for the absence
of cerebral pathology in some of the mice with motor
disability remains unclear. We cannot, however, exclude the
possibility that subtle pathological abnormalities might have
escaped our analysis. Vice versa, some Notch3Arg170Cys mice
with microinfarction in the motor area did not display overt
motor deficits or ataxia. However, the phenotypic outcome of
similar events might differ between individual mice, in line
with the highly variable clinical presentation of the disorder
in CADASIL patients, even among individuals with identical
mutation.2,16,41 The incomplete penetrance of the Notch3Arg170Cys
phenotype may in part be accounted for by the partially
outbred, mixed genetic background of the colony
(129SvEv:Swiss), with differences in potential modifying
genetic factors among individual mice. Genetic background
differences may also contribute to the difference in phenotype
and phenotype severity between the Notch3Arg170Cysknock-in
model and the other Notch3 mutant models (C57BL/6, FVB,
C57BL/6:Balb/C26,27,31–33).
In summary, this functional genetic study showed that
Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in mice developed most of the characteristic
features of CADASIL neurovascular disease. Pathology
and disease was late-onset, was dominant, and
included not only the cerebral and peripheral arteriopathy but
also several of the typical CADASIL brain pathologies,
including microinfarction, as well as neurological symptoms.
This novel mouse model thus may offer new opportunities to
study CADASIL pathogenesis.

Notch3 Arg170Cys Knock-In Mice Display Pathologic and 
Clinical Features of the Neurovascular Disorder Cerebral 
Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts 
and Leukoencephalophathy
Wallays, Nuyens, et al.
SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS
GENERATION OF THE MICE
A  targeting  vector  (Supplement  Figure  IA)  was  constructed  to  replace 
exon  4  with  a  mutated  exon  4  sequence  containing  a CGT-to-TGT point 
mutation  of  nucleotide  567  of  the  murine Notch3 cDNA  (Genbank  accession 
number X74760). This mutation causes an Arg to Cys substitution of amino acid 
170 in epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat 4 and corresponds to the prevalent 
Arg169Cys CADASIL  mutation  in  humans.1 The  5’  homology  in  the  targeting 
vector  consisted  of  a  6.2-kb  XhoI-PstI  fragment  comprising  the  major  part  of
intron  2,  exon  3,  the  mutated  exon  4,  exon  5  and  part  of  intron  5.  The  3’ 
homology consisted of the adjacent downstream 2.8-kb Bsu36I-SacI fragment
spanning the remaining part of intron 5, and exon 6 through approximately half 
of intron 8 (Supplemental Figure IA). A loxP-flanked neomycin resistance (neor)
cassette was inserted in intron 5 between the PstI and Bsu36I site. A thymidine
kinase  cassette  was  cloned  downstream  of  the  3’  homology  to  allow  for 
negative selection against random integration events. Along with the CADASIL 
mutation, a silent mutation creating a HincII site was introduced in exon 4 for 
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1426430701)
2
genotyping  purposes.  Sequencing  of  all  exons  confirmed  the  presence  of  the 
mutations and the otherwise correct Notch3 DNA sequence. 
The vector was linearized with Not1 prior to electroporation in 129SvEv 
ES cells2 as described.3 Correctly targeted clones were identified by appropriate 
Southern  blot  analysis  (Supplemental  Figure  IA,B  and  not  shown).  The 
presence  of  the  introduced  HincII  site  was  verified  by  PCR  using  primers 
spanning  the  mutated  region  followed  by  HincII  restriction  digestion  of  the 
amplicons,  and  the  presence  of  the  CADASIL-like  mutation  was  finally 
confirmed by sequencing (not shown). The targeted clones were then used for 
embryo aggregation with Swiss morula stage embryos as described previously3
to generate chimeric and transgenic animals, still carrying the neor cassette in
intron  6  (Notch3+/neo and  Notch3neo/neo mice).  In parallel,  a  correctly  targeted 
clone was subjected to transient transfection with the Cre-expression plasmid 
pOG231,4 to  excise  the  loxP-flanked  neor cassette  in vitro.  This  yielded 
Notch3+/m clones with correct excision of the intronic neor cassette as identified 
by  PCR  analysis.  These  Cre-excised  ES  cells  likewise  were  used  for 
aggregation  with  Swiss  morula  embryos  to  generate  mice  (Notch3+/m and 
Notch3m/m mice). Both colonies were maintained by heterozygous breeding to 
generate  the  respective  wild  type,  heterozygous  and  homozygous  mutant 
littermate  offspring  (mixed  genetic  background  of  overall  50%  129EvSv:50% 
Swiss in both colonies) for phenotypic analysis. 
All  mutant  genotypes  (Notch3+/m,  Notch3m/m,  Notch3+/neo,  Notch3neo/neo) 
were obtained at the expected Mendelian distribution (not shown) and displayed 
a normal viability (up to 24 month survival) and fertility (not shown).

3
Mutant mice of either colony displayed identical phenotypes, irrespective 
of homo- or heterozygocity of the mutation (Supplemental Note I, Supplemental 
Note II), thus indicating a dominant effect, similar to the situation in CADASIL 
patients.5,6 Therefore,  heterozygous  and  homozygous  mutant  mice  of  either 
colony  were  considered  equally  as  mutant  mice  and  are  further  named 
Arg170Cys mutant (Notch3Arg170Cys) mice.  Expression  analyses  were 
consistently performed with material from homozygous mutant mice.
Housing and all experimental animal procedures were approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the K.U. Leuven.
GENOTYPING OF THE MICE
Tail  biopsies  were  lysed  overnight  at  55°C  using  a  proteinase  K 
containing  lysis  buffer  as  described.3 PCR  genotyping  was  performed  on 
purified  genomic  DNA  using  pure  Taq  ready-to  go  PCR  beads  (Amersham 
biosciences, UK). Oligos located in exon 5 (sense 5’-GTC AAC GTG GAT GAC 
TGT CCT GGA C-3’) and exon 6 (antisense 5’-ATA GGG CAG GCA CAG TAG 
AAA GAG-3’) were used to detect the remnant loxP site in the Notch3+/m and 
Notch3m/m mutant mice (giving a 550-bp band on the mutant allele as compared 
to a 450-bp band on the wild type allele) (Supplemental Figure IB). To reveal 
the  presence  of  the  neo-gene  in  the  Notch3+/neo or  Notch3neo/neo mice,  oligos 
located in the neo-gene (neo sense 5’-CGC ATC GCC TTC TAT CGC CTT CTT 
GAC-3’)  and  the  exon  6  antisense  primer  were  used,  giving  a  700-bp  band 
specific for the neo-mutant allele (Supplemental Figure IA).

RNA ANALYSIS
RNA  analysis  was  done  on  samples  from  wild  type  and  homozyougs 
mutant  mice.  Total  RNA  was  isolated  from  cells  or  from  fresh  frozen  brain 
biopsies using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) and was reverse 
transcribed  using  random  hexamer  primers  (Amersham  Pharmacia  Biotech) 
and  Superscript  II  (Invitrogen).  Quantitative  real-time  RT-PCR  was  performed 
using the Taqman Universal PCR master kit (Taqman Technology, PE Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  or SYBR  Green  (Applied  Biosystems,  Lennik, 
Belgium) on  the  ABIPRISM  7700  sequence  detector  (Applied  Biosystems, 
Carlsbad,  CA) as  described.7,8 Copy  numbers  of  the  analyzed  mRNAs  were 
normalized using HPRT or β-actin mRNA levels. Home-designed primers and 
probes  or  premade  Taqman  primer  sets  (Applied Biosystems,  Carlsbad,  CA) 
were used as listed below.

Mm00469280_m1,  murine  Hes1: Mm00468601_m1 and  murine  Nrarp:
Mm00482529_m1.
WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS
Protein was extracted from brain using detergent-containing buffer (1% 
Triton)  and  equal-loading  SDS-PAGE  gels  were  used  for  immunoblotting  as 
described.8 Antibodies  used  were  the mouse  Notch3  ECD  specific  antibody 
AF1308  (R&D  Systems  Europe,  Abingdon,  UK)  and  mouse  Notch3  ICD 
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). ECD/ICD ratios were 
determined by densitometry of the bands using the NIH Image J software.
COCULTURE ASSAY 
Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from E.13.5 
wild type and homozygous mutant embryos. For co-culture assay, MEFs were 
seeded at 150,000 cells per well in 6-well plates without or with 200,000 human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Lonza, Braine-l’Alleud, Belgium). After 
(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
6
incubation for 24 hours, the cells were processed for RNA extraction and qRTPCR
 expression  analysis,  using  primers  with  confirmed  specificity  for  the 
murine genes. 
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION MODEL 
Mice were  exposed  to  hypoxia  by  placing  them  in  a  tightly  sealed 
chamber under  normobaric  hypoxia  (10%  O2),  which  was  maintained  by  a 
continuous inflow of 2 l/min N2 and 2 l/min normal air (21% O2). Normoxia mice 
were  kept  in normal  air  (21%  O2).  After  exposure  for  28  days,  mice  were 
weighed  and immediately  used  for  determination  of  right  ventricular  (RV) 
hypertrophy expressed as the ratio of right ventricle weight to left ventricle (LV) 
plus septum (S) weight [RV/(LV+S)].9
Pulmonary  arterial  remodeling  was assessed  on  lung  sections 
immunostained for murine smooth muscle cell alpha-actin (SMA), by counting 
the number of partially muscularized (incomplete coverage of SMA+ cells) and 
completely muscularized (complete coverage of SMA+ cells) peripheral vessels 
that were located distally to the bronchi.9 At least 15 areas equivalent to 100 
alveoli were counted on 2 to 3 non-adjacent sections per mouse. 
SKIN WOUND MODEL 
Vessel regeneration was studied using a model of skin wound healing in 
which a standardized 15-mm full-thickness skin wound was inflicted on the back 
of the mice taking care not to damage the underlying muscle.7 Wound healing 
was monitoring by daily measurement of the length and width of the wound. At 
14 days after wounding, skin tissue was dissected for histology. CD31+ total and 
( 8.0.0.2542.887787056 PDF Extractor SDK EVALUATION)
7
SMA+ arterial vessel densities were determined in the wound and border area 
by  counting  the  number  of  vessels  (expressed  as  number/mm2)  using  the 
KS300 morphometric software (Zeiss). The border area is constituted of the two 
optical  fields  flanking  the  wound  area;  per  mouse,  the  averages  of  the  two 
flanking areas were taken as data for the border area.
HISTOLOGY, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND  TRANSMISSION  ELECTRON 
MICROSCOPY
Tissue  preparation. For  light  microscopical  analyses,  tissue  was 
dissected from PBS and zinc fixative (Anatech Ltd., Battle Creek, MI) perfused 
mice, paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 10 µm thickness. 
For transmission electron microscopy, tissues (whole brain, tail biopsies) 
were  fixed  with  3%  PFA  and  2%  glutaraldehyde  in  0.1  M  cacodylate,  pH7.4. 
Brain tissue was sliced into 1 to 2 mm thick slices using a brain slicer before 
post-fixation  in  2%  osmium  tetroxide  in  100  mM  cacodylate.  Postfixed  tissue 
was  dehydrated,  treated  with  propylene  oxide  and  embedded  in  epoxy  resin 
(EMS Inc., Hatfield, PA). Ultra-thin sections (80 nm), counterstained with 1 % 
lead  citrate  and  0.5  %  uranyl  acetate,  were  examined  on  a  Hitachi  H7650 
electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc.). 
Histochemical  stainings. All  tissue  sections  were  stained  with 
haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological analysis. For brain analysis, 
4-5  slides  containing  up  to  70  coronal  sections  at  100-µm  intervals  and 
spanning  the  brain  from  ca  Bregma  +3  through -4  were  H&E  stained  and 
inspected in order to obtain a representative overview of each brain. For Perl's 
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-536415165)
8
iron staining, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, incubated for 40 minutes in 
a  solution  of  equal  volumes  20%  HCl-solution  (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany) 
and 10% potassium ferrocyanate solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO), rinsed 
in demineralised water, and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red.  
Immunostaining. Sections  were  immunostained for  fibrinogen,  CD45, 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), smooth muscle alpha actin (SMA) or CD31 
using immunofluorescent or colorimetric staining as described.3,8,10,11
Morphometric analysis of lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension model) 
and skin vessels (wound healing model) is described above. Capillary density in 
cerebral  cortex  was  quantified  by  counting  CD31+ capillaries (expressed  as 
number/mm2)  using  the  KS300  morphometric  software  (Zeiss). At  least  10 
optical fields were counted on 2-3 non-adjacent sections per mouse. 
Images were acquired with the Zeiss AxioVision 4.6 software on a Zeiss 
Axioplan 2 imaging miscroscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MrC5 digital 
camera (Carl Zeiss, Zaventem, Belgium).  
SUPPLEMENTAL RESULTS
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE I: NORMAL EXPRESSION OF NOTCH RECEPTOR
Expression of Notch3
Expression  of  mutant  Notch3  in  Notch3m/m or  Notch3neo/neo mice  was 
comparable to the level of wild type Notch3 expression in the respective wild 
type littermates as confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR on brain extracts 
of young mice (copies mRNA Notch3/103 copies mRNA HPRT: 0.93 ± 0.13 for 
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1306943093)
9
Notch3m/m versus 1.2 ± 0.17 for the corresponding wild type littermates; mean ± 
SEM, N=4, P=NS; and 2.1 ± 0.58 for Notch3neo/neo mice versus 1.9 ± 0.39 for 
their wild type littermates; mean ± SEM, N=4-6, P=NS). Similar Notch3 mRNA 
expression was also observed in cultures of embryonic fibroblasts derived from 
wild  type  or  Notch3m/m embryos  (copies  mRNA  Notch3/105 copies  mRNA βactin
: 14.3 ± 0.93 for Notch3m/m fibroblasts versus 11.3 ± 0.94 for wild type cells; 
mean  ±  SEM,  N=3, P=NS).  Thus,  the Arg170Cys mutation  per  se  nor  the 
presence of the intronic loxP site in Notch3m/m mice or of the neor cassette in 
Notch3neo/neo mice interferes with gene transcription and RNA processing. The 
latter was further verified by sequencing of cDNA from the mutant mice which 
confirmed that exon 5/exon6 splicing  occurred correctly. 
Furthermore, equal expression was retained during aging as shown by 
comparable Notch3 mRNA levels in extracts from 20-month old wild type and 
Notch3m/m mice (Supplemental Table I). This was confirmed at the protein level 
using  Western  blotting  of  protein  extracts  from  aged  brain  with  an  antibody 
against  the  Notch3  intracellular  domain,  revealing  comparable  levels  by 
densitometry  (arbitrary  units:  3,320 ± 350  for  Notch3m/m mice  versus  4,200 ±
420 for their wild type littermates; mean ± SEM, N=5-4, P=NS).
Expression of other Notch receptors
No  compensatory  upregulation  of  other  receptors  was  observed  in 
homozygous  Notch3R170C mice. qRT-PCR  analysis  on  embryonic  skin 
fibroblasts  and  on  brain  from  20-month  old  mice  showed  no  genotypic 
differences,  except  for  a  4-fold  higher  expression  of  Notch4  in Notch3R170C
embryonic  fibroblasts  as  compared  to  wild  type  embryos;  this  elevated

10
expression  was  however  not  seen  in  the  brain  of  the  mutant  mice 
(Supplemental Table I).
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE II: COMPARABLE  PHENOTYPE IN  HETEROZYGOUS  AND 
HOMOZYGOUS MUTANT MICE
Characterization of heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice revealed 
comparable  phenotypes,  with  respect  to  the  arteriopathy,  brain  pathology  as 
well as neurological symptoms. This indicated that the Arg170Cys mutation in 
mice is dominant, similar to its counterpart Arg169Cys mutation and the other 
known CADASIL mutations in humans.5,6
Indeed,  the  ultrastructural  analysis  of  the  tail  samples  showed  the 
occurrence of the arteriopathy in 2 out of 3 heterozygous mutant mice analyzed 
as well as in 2 out of 3 homozygous mutant mice analyzed. For ultrastructural 
analysis of brain samples, only homozygous samples were used.
The  histopathological  analysis  of  the  brain  was  performed  on  33 
heterozygous  and  40  homozygous  mutant  mice.  In  both  groups,  a  similar 
incidence of CADASIL-like brain histopathology was observed, i.e. in 6 out of 33 
heterozygous  (18%)  and  11  out  of  40  homozyogous  mice  (27%)  (P=NS  by 
Fisher’s exact test). 
Observation  of  this  same  group  of  mice  for  motor  ability  revealed 
abnormalities  in  15%  of  the  heterozygous  mutants  (5/33)  and  10%  of  the 
homozygous mutant mice (4/40) (P=NS by the Fisher exact test).
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
11
Behavioral  testing  (see  also  Supplemental  Note  III)  was  done  on  10 
heterozygous and 12 homozygous mutant mice, revealing an approximately 4-
fold reduced center visit frequency in the social exploration test for the pooled 
mutant population as compared to wild type controls (Supplemental Figure III). 
Among  the  mutant  mice,  center  visit  frequency  did  not  differ  between 
heterozogous and homozygous mutant mice (5 ± 3.2 for heterozygous mutant 
mice versus 6 ± 2.6 for homozygous mutant mice, mean ± SEM, P=NS).
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE III: REDUCED EXPLORATIVE BEHAVIOR
Progressive cognitive  decline  and  changes  in  complex  behaviors  is  a 
typical  symptom  in  CADASIL  patients.12,13 To  evaluate  complex  behavioral 
performance,  we  compared  wild  type  (N=10)  and  Notch3Arg170Cys female  mice 
(N=22)  of  15-18  months  (i.e.  beyond  the  age  of  onset  of  arteriopathy)  in 
cognitive and  anxiety/exploratory  tests  (elevated  plus  maze,  radial  maze  test, 
passive  avoidance  test,  contextual  fear  conditioning,  open  field  exploration, 
social exploration14,15). No obvious difference between genotypes was observed 
in  memory/learning  tests  (elevated  plus  maze,  radial  maze  test,  passive 
avoidance  test,  contextual  fear  conditioning;  not  shown).  In  the  social 
exploration  test, Notch3Arg170Cys mice  showed  somewhat  decreased  total  path 
length  (possibly  related to  their  ataxia).  Furhtermore,  their  relative  distance 
moved in the center was decreased, and a pronounced reduction in center visit 
frequency was measured (P<0.05) while corner visits were comparable to those 
of  wild  type  control  mice  (Supplemental  Figure  III).  A  tendency  of  decreased 
exploratory behavior was also seen in the open field test (reduced center visit

frequency and center visit duration) (not shown). Reduced exploratory behavior 
may relate to changes in motivational and/or affective functions, which may be 
in accordance with the observed narrowing of the field of interest in CADASIL 
patients.13

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE I: Generation of Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in mutant mice.
A, Strategy for introduction of the Arg170Cys (R170C) mutation into the murine 
Notch3 gene  by  homologous  recombination  in  embryonic  stem  cells.  The 
scheme shows the targeting vector, containing the cgt-to-tgt mutation in exon 4 
(denoted by the asterisk), and the wild type (WT) allele (top); the targeted allele 
after  homologous  recombination  containing  both  the  mutation  and  an  intronic 
neomycin resistance cassette (neor) (middle); and the mutant allele after Crerecombinase
 mediated  excision  of  neor (bottom).  Introns  and  exons  are 
indicated  by  the  shaded  bar  and  dark  boxes  in  the  genes,  respectively. 
Relevant  diagnostic  restriction  sites  are  indicated  on  the  genes.  Hybridization 
probes  (black  bars),  and  the  diagnostic  restriction  fragments  with  their 
respective length are indicated under the genes. Black arrows under the genes 
denote  the  primers  used  for  PCR  genotyping,  with  indication  of  the  expected 
amplicon lengths. B, PCR on genomic DNA from wild type, heterozygous and 
homozygous mutant mice generated with a targeted ES cell clone after in vitro 
Cre-recombinase  mediated  excision  of  neor,  revealing  amplicons  of  the 
expected size (see A). C, Immunoblotting of brain extracts for Notch3 ECD and 
ICD  and  densitometric  quantification  of  the  ECD/ICD  ratio,  revealing 
comparable ratios for wild type and Notch3Arg170Cys knock-in mice. Aged mice of 
20-22  months  were  analyzed;  homozygous Notch3Arg170Cys mice  were  used. 
Graph shows mean ± SEM, N=8-10. Representative blots are shown under the 
graph.

(R170C) (A,C) or wild type (WT) mice (B,D) at 8-9 months of age, indicating 
enlarged  smooth  muscle  cell  intercellular  space  in  the  mutant  mice  as 
compared to wild type mice (white lines in A and B). The Notch3Arg170Cys mutant 
mice also display more irregular and looser connections of the endothelial cells 
and  basement  membrane  (arrows  in C and D).  Note  the  vacuolization  of  the 
endothelial cells in panel C (arrowheads) indicating degeneration. Panel C is an 
enlargement  of  the  boxed  zone  1  indicated  in  panel A;  panel D is  an
enlargement  of  the  boxed  zone  in  panel B. E,  Granular  osmiophilic  material
