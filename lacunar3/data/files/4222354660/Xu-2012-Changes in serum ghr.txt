ABSTRACT
Ischemic stroke occurs as a result of an obstruction within a blood
vessel supplying blood to the brain. Gastrointestinal mucosal damage not
only induces local and systemic inflammatory reactions but may also
result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. We studied whether the
changes in serum ghrelin and small intestinal motility occur in cerebral
ischemia. The focal cerebral ischemia rat models were produced by the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. The MCAO group was
further equally divided into five subgroups at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr, and
the sham operated rats were used as controls. Serum ghrelin level was
analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and small intestinal
motility was measured by methylene blue staining. The ileum tissue was
examined by light and electron microscopy. The neurologic scores were 0
for all the rats in the control group and 2–3 for those in the MCAO group,
suggesting that rat models were established successfully. The serum ghrelin
level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control
group (P< 0.05). However, the impelling force in MCAO rats was significantly
lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), reaching the lowest
level at 24 hr. Damage to the intestinal mucosa, including villus
intestinalis, vacuolar degeneration of organelles, widened cell–cell junctions
, and apoptotic cells could be found under the light and electron
microscopy. Our results showed that higher level of serum ghrelin decreased
gastrointestinal motility and damage to the intestinal mucosa existed in rats
with MCAO. Anat Rec, 295:307–312, 2012. V V C 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks one of
the arteries in the brain. The incidence of ischemic
stroke has been increasing gradually in recent years
(Wang et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2009). The pathological
change not only brings pain to patients, but also causes
a series of complications, resulting in poor prognosis,
decline in quality of life and even death. It has been
shown previously that damage to the gastrointestinal
mucosa could induce local and systemic inflammatory
reactions and may result in multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS) (Longa et al., 1989; Tulassay and
Herszenyi, 2010).
Previous studies have also indicated that stress could
damage the function of intestinal mucosal barrier
(Hotchkiss et al., 2000; Grogan et al., 2004). The gastrointestinal
tract bears the stressful events such as the
severe brain injury, trauma, burn, infection, and hemorrhagic
shock. It plays an important role in developing
MODS by the collapse of the intestinal barrier function

from stressful events. The gastrointestinal tract is therefore
considered to be the key organ to trigger MODS
(Omerbegovic et al., 2003). The increased permeability of
the gastrointestinal mucosa resulting from direct or indirect
damage remains the main cause of gastrointestinal
exposure to bacteria and endotoxins.
The exact mechanism of functional gastric kinetic disorder
and mucosal damage is still unclear. Several factors
such as hypoxia, lipid peroxidation, endotoxemia,
inflammation, and apoptosis may partially be related to
the mechanism. The brain–intestine axis and brain–gut
peptides may also play very important roles in the regulation
of functional gastric kinetic disorder and mucosal
damage mechanism. Either primary or secondary brain
damage may lead to changes in the synthesis and secretion
of both excitatory and inhibitory neuropeptides,
which may further affect the gastric motility. Previous
research has shown that the change may result from
gastric hormone changes (Liu et al., 2003). Some
researchers have shown large gastric and intestinal hormonal
changes in patients and other animals suffering
from injuries such as constraint and acute pancreatitis
in the acute stage of gastric kinetic dysfunctions (Imamura
et al., 1998; Nakade et al., 2005). The serum cholecystokinin-8
(CCK-8), somatostatin (SS), and gastrin
(GAS) levels increased, while the serum vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP) levels decreased in patients with
acute burns and gastric kinetic disorders (Liu et al.,
2003).
However, the changes in serum ghrelin and small intestinal
motility after cerebral ischemia remained
unclear till now. To provide more information for reducing
time of therapy and improving prognosis, we investigated
the changes in serum ghrelin and small intestinal
motility after cerebral ischemia in the present study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Reagents
All experimental procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beijing
Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China.
Forty-eight healthy male Wistar rats weighing 200–220
g were bought from Beijing WeiTong LiHua Experimental
Animal Company (Beijing, China). Nylon suture
thread was purchased from Beijing Shadong Biotechnology
Company (Beijing, China). Ghrelin kit was the
product of Beijing Kangtai Biotechnology Company
(Beijing, China). Methylthionine chloride and 2%TTC
were purchased from Beijing Chemicals Company
(Beijing, China).
Animal Models and Experimental Design
Forty-eight healthy male Wistar rats were randomly
divided into six groups: the sham operated group and
five experimental groups with ischemic stroke. According
to the final time of each experiment, they were divided
into 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr subgroups and the control
group separately (N ¼ 8). The middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model was developed using the thread
occlusion method proposed by Longa (Longa et al.,
1989). The neurologic findings in all experimental rats
were scored on a scale as described by Longa et al.
(1989). Briefly, the suitable suture thread was chosen to
meet the middle cerebral artery based on the body
weight of rats (the head end of suture thread was 0.28
0.02 mm). Under an operating microscope, the internal
carotid artery was exposed through a neck incision and
cut 3 mm. A suture thread was then inserted into the
middle cerebral artery and gently advanced until mild
resistance felt, thereby indicting occlusion of the origin
of the middle cerebral artery in the circle of Willis. Rats
in the sham-operation group (control group) were subjected
to the same surgical procedure except thread
suture was not used. After that, the brain tissues of all
rats were stained with TTC to confirm whether the
MCAO model was successfully established or not.
Detection of the Intestinal Kinetic Power
One milliliter of 50% methylene blue was injected into
the experimental rats’ stomach via a gastric tube at 30
min before the experiment, and they were anesthetized
30 min later. After laparotomy, marked the dye terminal
end, measured the impelling ratio according to the
length among the musculus sphincter pylori and the end
of the blue stained intestine and the whole length of the
intestine (from the musculus sphincter pylori to the ileocecal
junction).
Detection of Serum Ghrelin Level and
Pathohistological Examination
Serum ghrelin level was measured using enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to
the manufacturer’s instruction (Wuhan EIAab Science,
China). Intestinal mucosa at the ileocecal junction was
observed under light microscopy and electron microscopy.
Pathohistology Observations
The specimen-processing steps for scanning under
electron microscopy were as follows: (i) The specimens
fixed with electron microscope fixation solution were
extracted, and the fixation solution was removed with a
pipette; then, the specimens were washed twice with
0.9% saline (10 min every time). (ii) Alcohol solutions
(30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) were used to perform gradient
dehydration (once respectively for 30, 50, 70, 80,
and 90% of alcohol; twice for 100% of absolute alcohol; 4
min every time). (iii) Tert-butyl alcohol solutions (50, 70,
90, 95, and 100%) were used to perform gradient substitution
(once respectively for 50, 70, 90, and 95% of tertbutyl
alcohol); 4 min every time; twice for 100% tertbutyl
alcohol; 100% tert-butyl alcohol was maintained at
40C otherwise it easily solidifies. Finally, the slides
were removed and pasted on the original plate. At this
time, they were ready for testing.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean  SD (standard deviation
). Statistically significant differences among the
subgroups suffered the same treatment or between different
treated groups at the same time point were determined
by analysis of variance. P < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Neuroethological Scale and Stain with TTC of
Brain
Neuroethological abnormalities were not observed in
the control group, while functional disorders appeared in
the experimental group, for example, limb weakness and
decreased tactile impression happened on the contralateral
side, and the contralateral anterior limb flexed
when raising the tail. The Hoover’s sign on the ipsilateral
side was normal. The scores varied from 1 to 3 in
the neuroethological evaluation (Longa et al., 1989). The
results of TTC staining showed that the area, which was
not stained in the experimental group, indicated
ischemia.
Impelling Force of the Intestine
The impelling force in each subgroup was statistically
significantly lower than that in the control group. It
reached the lowest level at 24 hr after cerebral ischemia
and remained at the lower level until 48 hr (Table 1).
Serum Ghrelin Level
Serum ghrelin level in each subgroup was higher than
that in the control group and the difference was statistically
significant (P< 0.05). It increased at 3 hr after the
operation, peaked at 24 hr, and remained higher until
48 hr (Table 2). There was a significant negative correlation
between the serum ghrelin level and the intestinal
impelling force in cerebral ischemic models (r ¼  0.841,
P< 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Change in Intestinal Mucosa
The rats of the MCAO model group showed intestinal
villi engorgement, thickening, and decurtation under
light microscopy. Twenty-four hours after cerebral ischemic
formation, naked lamina propria and damaged villus
tip were observed, while they were almost intact in the
control group (Fig. 2).
Electron microscopy revealed swollen intestinal villi,
and chondrosome, vacuolar degeneration, and apoptotic
cells. The inflammatory cells infiltration and lodging of
microvillus could also be observed under electron microscopy.
In addition, the damage was aggravated with the
increase of time (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
In this experiment, the MCAO model was produced
using the Longa thread occlusion method (Longa et al.,
1989). The brain ischemic symptoms were comparatively
mild as only one cervical cerebral artery was blocked
and the cerebral blood flow was supplied through the ipsilateral
external carotid artery and the circle of Willis.
All experimental rats with intestinal mucosal damage
survived. The impelling ratio of gastrointestinal kinetic
power in the experimental group was significantly lower

than that of the control group. The results indicated
that we successfully established the animal model of
damaged intestinal mucosa and disturbed intestinal
kinetics induced by ischemic stroke.
In this study, the morphologic changes of the intestinal
mucosa revealed that barrier disturbance could be
traced even in the early stages of ischemic stress. Cellular
edema, thickening, and shortening of the villi were
observed in the intestinal mucosa after 3 hr of surgery
in the MCAO group and became worsen as time progressed.
At 24 hr, necrosis occurred in the top of the villi
and caused damage to the intestinal mucosa in the early
stages of ischemic stroke, leading to gastrointestinal
kinetic changes. It has been shown that several gastrointestinal
disorders, such as depression of gastrointestinal
motility, extension of the gastric emptying, and weakening
in tension of the lower esophageal sphincter are
more likely to occur in severe brain trauma. The impelling
force ratio showed that the ratios in each subgroup
of MCAO were significantly lower than those of the control
group, which supports the existence of gastric
kinetic disorders in the early stage of ischemic stroke.
We also observed that stress was associated with stronger
action in rat gastric antrum with disappearance of
rhythmic contraction. VIP has the inhibitory action on
gastric motility. Serum VIP level significantly increased
in 1 or 2 hr after stress in the rat model, while serum
CCK-8 level increased immediately after stress but
returned to normal level afterwards. We thought that
brain tissue with edema, congestion, bleeding, and necrosis
in ischemic stroke may cause neurohumoral regulation
disorders.
Extensive release of vasoactive substances may lead to
gastric mucosal ischemia, hypoxia, and reperfusion
injury and further influence the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal
tract by lowering its contraction and transmission
ability. Gastric kinetic disorder may occur after
gastric mucosal injury, which could result in dysbacteriosis
and endotoxemia, leading to the systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (Sun et al., 1998). Gastric
mucosal injury also triggers imbalance between oxidantantioxidant
systems and proinflammatory and antiinflammatory
states. The injury to the gastric mucosal
barrier may then be enhanced by the synergistic effects
and cascade reactions of both oxidation and inflammation
, which may further cause damage to remote tissue
and organs. In conclusion, the mutual action of gastric
mucosal damage and kinetic disorder interact as both
are caused or affected by ischemic stroke.
As a newly discovered brain–gut peptide, ghrelin regulates
the gastrointestinal kinetics. However, it has only
been studied for ischemic stroke kinetic changes in

models. Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand of growth hormone
secreting receptor (GH-Sr), which can promote
secretion of gastric acid and food intake in rats (Asakawa
et al., 2005; Toshinai et al., 2006). Atropine and vagotomy
blocked this promotion caused by intravenous injection of
ghrelin. Masada et al. (2001) reported that ghrelin regulates
gastric kinetics via neuropeptide-Y1 receptor and
nonselective corticotropin releasing factor receptor-1 in
the paraventricular nucleus (Tebbe et al., 2005). Ghrelin
is regulated by nutritional and hormonal factors. Several
factors, including high-fat diet, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia
, high body mass index, gastrectomy, growth
factors, interleukin-1b, and somatostatin may decrease
ghrelin secretion. In contrast, hunger, low-protein diet,

weight loss and acetylcholine may increase ghrelin secretion
(Lee et al., 2002; Mager et al., 2008; Monteleone
et al., 2008).
Some researchers have demonstrated that ghrelin can
promote the gastric emptying and bowel movement
(Tebbe et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005). However, the results
of our study indicated that the serum ghrelin level in
stroke subgroups was higher than that of the control
group and had significantly negative correlation to the
intestinal impelling ratio. A possible explanation of this
observation is that ischemic stroke may cause neurohumoral
regulation disorders, which promote or inhibit
gastrointestinal tract motility. The concomitant effect
causes decrease in enteric motility, and the increase of
serum ghrelin is compensatory. Previous studies showed
that once the middle cerebral artery was blocked for 15
min, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) can be greatly synthesized
to prevent ischemic brain edema and cerebrovascular
damage in rats (Masada et al., 2001). We
proposed that increased ghrelin may be released from
the gut or the central nerve system such as thalamencephalon
, pituitary, and hippocampus. It may increase the
expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 to protect the
mitochondria in the area cornu ammonis 1 (CA 1) of the
hippocampus and prevent possible damage to CA 1 in ischemic
/reperfused rats. Exogenous ghrelin can also
enhance the function of HSP70 in cellular protection.
In summary, the results of the present study demonstrated
that MCAO rat model had significant changes in
their gastric kinetic and serum ghrelin levels in the
early stage of cerebral ischemia. There was a negative
correlation between ghrelin level and intestinal motility,
that is as the serum ghrelin level increased, intestinal
motility decreased. This can be explained as a compensatory
reaction in the early ischemic stage. The up-regulation
of serum ghrelin may prevent brain damage and
impose decreased intestinal motility so as to decrease
injury to the mucosal barrier. Meanwhile, the decrease
in intestinal kinetics demonstrates that this compensation
cannot sustain the physiological intestinal function.
Brain ischemic-associated intestinal dysfunction may be
the outcome of several factors and the change in serum
ghrelin level may not be the main or only cause.
