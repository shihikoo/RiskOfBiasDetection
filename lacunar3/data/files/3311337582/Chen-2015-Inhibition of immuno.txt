Inhibition of immunoproteasome reduces infarction
volume and attenuates inflammatory reaction in a rat
model of ischemic stroke
X Chen1,2,4, X Zhang2,4, Y Wang2, H Lei2,HSu 3, J Zeng1, Z Pei*,1 and R Huang*,1
The detailed knowledge about the contribution of immunoproteasome to the neuroinflammation in ischemic stroke is still not
available. The immunoreactivity of low molecular mass peptide 2 (LMP2) and low molecular mass peptide 7 (LMP7) was evident in
the ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex and striatum following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Both LMP2 and
LMP7 increased as early as 4 h after the MCAO, further increased at 24 h, peaked at 72 h and decreased 7 days later. LMP2 and
LMP7 were mainly present in astrocytes and microglia/macrophage cells, respectively. LMP2 knockdown by shRNA (short hairpin
RNA) markedly reduced the levels of LMP2 and LMP7 protein and caused 75.5 and 78.6% decrease in the caspase-like (C-L) and
chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activities, respectively. Compared with cont-shRNA group (39.7%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral
hemisphere), the infarction volumes were reduced to 22.5% in LMP2-shRNA group. Additionally, LMP2 knockdown significantly
reduced activated astrocytes and microglia, the expression nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and caused less accumulation of ischemia-induced protein ubiquitination compared with MG132. These
findings demonstrate that inhibition of LMP2 significantly attenuates inflammatory reaction and offers neuroprotection against
focal cerebral ischemia in rats, suggesting that selective immunoproteasome inhibitors may be a promising strategy for stroke
treatment.

Awealth of data from both human and animal studies indicates
that inflammation has a pivotal role in ischemic injury.1 It is
generally believed that excessive inflammation mediates
ischemic injury whereas blockade of inappropriate inflammatory
responses improves ischemic injury.1 Normally, inflammatory
processes are heavily controlled by complex
endogenous regulatory systems such as proteasome system.
The proteasome system is the major system for intracellular
protein degradation and regulates inflammatory processes by
degradation of inflammation-associated molecules including
NF-κB, a critical transcription factor for numerous proinflammatory
genes.2Proteasome has been reported to activate NF-
κB through degradation of the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB,
which in turn induces inflammatory processes.3 In contrast,
proteasome inhibitors exhibit anti-inflammatory actions in a
variety of inflammatory-related diseases. In the field of stroke,
several general proteasome inhibitors such as MLN519 have
been demonstrated to reduce post-stroke inflammatory and
protect against cerebral ischemia.4,5 However, the clinical
uses of general proteasome inhibitors are often limited by their
side effects due to their non-selective inhibition of protein
degradation.6 Thus, selectively targeting proteasome elements
responsible for inflammatory pathways would increase
efficacy and reduce side effects.
Immunoproteasome is a subtype of proteasome, which is
predominantly present in the immune cells. Immunoproteasome
contains two major catalytic subunits: LMP2
(low-molecular weight protein 2, PSMB9,β1i) and LMP7 (lowmolecular
weight protein 7, PSMB8, β5i). It has been
demonstrated that immunoproteasome has a critical role in
regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines7 and
maintaining protein homeostasis under cytokine-induced
oxidative stress by preventing protein aggregate formation.8,9 Blockage of LMP7 with immunoproteasome-specific

inhibitor PR957 affords a strongly attenuation of disease and a
suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,
IL-23 and IL-2.7,10
Immunoproteasome and its subunits have been linked to a
variety of human diseases including central nervous system
(CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer’s(AD) 11 and Huntington’s
diseases (HD).2,12 In 2006, Mishto et al.11 first reported the
presence and role of immunoproteasome and its LMP2 subunit
polymorphism at codon 60 in AD. In their study, immunoproteasome
is present in neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells in
the brain areas such as the hippocampus and the cerebellum.
In addition, expression of immunoproteasome is higher in the
brain of AD patients than in the brain of non-demented elderly.
Recently, upregulatedimmunoproteasomal subunits have been
also observed in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia,13
suggesting the involvement of immunoproteasome in ischemic
stroke. However, the function of immunoproteasome in cerebral
ischemia remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated
the time course and cellular distribution and function of
immunoproteasome subunit LMP2 and LMP7 in the rat brain
following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
Results
Expression and cellular localization of LMP2 in the
brains of MCAO rats. We first examined immunoproteasome
in the brains of rats subjected to 1 h of ischemia
followed by 4 h, 24 h, 72 h and 7 days of reperfusion. There

observed regions (a). There was only sparse weakest immunoreactivity of LMP2 in glia-like cells in the cortex and striatum in non-ischemic hemisphere and sham-operated
control rats (b). In contrast, the number of cells expressing strong LMP2 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere than in the contralateral
hemisphere at different time points (c and d, 72 h time point was shown here). LMP2 was mostly localized in cell nucleus in non-ischemic hemisphere whereas LMP2 was evident
in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm after MCA occlusion (arrow) (e and f). Five rats in each group were used for immunofluorescent assays (n=5). (B) Western blot showed
that LMP2 protein levels were significantly elevated in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and striatum all time points when compared with sham-operated control animals.
Quantification analysis confirmed that the level of LMP2 protein changed from 4 h to 7 days in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum (*Po0.001, compared with the controls;
#Po0.001 compared with the previous time point) (B). Five rats in each group were used for western blot (n=5). (C) Double immunostaining showed that the overwhelming
majority of LMP2 (green) was colocalized with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes (red) although some LMP2-positive cells were colocalized with CD4+T
lymphocytes (red), with OX42-positive microglia/macrophage cells (red) and with CD31-positive vascular endothelial cell (red) (arrow). In contrast, LMP2-positive cells were not
colocalized with NEUN-positive neurons (red) at any time points (figure 1C). Scale bars=80μm (inA:b–d), 50μm (inA: e and f,C). IP, ipsilateral hemisphere; ctrl, contralateral

was only sparse immunoreactivity of LMP2 in glia-like cells in
the cortex and striatum in non-ischemic hemisphere and
sham-operated control rats (Figure 1Ab). In contrast, the
number of cells expressing strong LMP2 immunoreactivity
was significantly higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere
than in the contralateral hemisphere at different time points
(Figure 1Ac−d). LMP2 immunoreactive cells were predominately
localized in the penumbra surrounding the infarct core
(Figure 1Ac−d). Furthermore, LMP2 was mostly localized in
cell nucleus in non-ischemic hemisphere whereas LMP2 was
evident in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm after MCA
occlusion (Figure 1Ae−f). Western blot showed that LMP2
changed in a time-dependent manner, namely, LMP2
increased as early as 4 h after reperfusion further increased
at 24 h, peaked at 72 h and decreased at 7 days. LMP2
protein levels were significantly elevated in the ipsilateral
cerebral cortex and striatum at all time points when compared
with sham-operated control animals. Quantification analysis
confirmed that the level of LMP2 protein changed from 4 h
to 7 days in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum
(*Po0.001, compared with the controls; #Po0.001
compared with the previous time point) (Figure 1B).
We further determined the cell type(s) expressing LMP2
following ischemia using double immunostaining with antibodies
against cell-specific antigens. The results showed that
the overwhelming majority of LMP2 (green) was colocalized
with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes (red)
although some LMP2-positive cells were colocalized with
CD4+T lymphocytes (red), with OX42-positive microglia/
macrophage cells (red) and with CD31-positive vascular
endothelial cell (red). In contrast, LMP2-positive cells were
not colocalized with NEUN-positive neurons (red) at any time
points (Figure 1C).
Expression and cellular localization of LMP7 in the
brains of MCAO rats. The immunofluorescent analysis of
rat brain sections showed that LMP7 signal was barely
detectable in the cortex and striatum in the sham-operated
animals and contralateral hemisphere in ischemic rats
(Figure 2Ab). In contrast, the LMP7 signal was evident in
the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere (Figure 2Ae−f). LMP7
was mostly present in the nucleus in non-ischemic hemisphere
whereas it was evident in both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm in ischemia hemisphere (Figure 2Ac−d). Similar to
LMP2, LMP7 changed significantly from 4 h to 7 days in
response to ischemia insult. Western blot confirmed that
LMP7 protein levels were elevated after 4 h of cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion, followed by a moderate further
increase at 24 h and peaked at 72 h, whereas the intensity
tended to decrease at 7 days. Quantification analysis
confirmed that the level of LMP7 protein changed from 4 h
to 7 days in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum
(*Po0.001, compared with the sham-operated controls;
#Po0.001 compared with the previous time point) (Figure
2Ae−f).
To investigate the cell type(s) expressing immunoproteasome
LMP7, brain sections were double-labeled using
antibodies against cell-specific antigens. LMP7 was mainly
expressed in OX42-positive microglia/macrophage cells (red),
some in CD4+T lymphocytes (red) and very few LMP7 in
GFAP-positive astrocytes (red) as well as CD31-positive
vascular endothelial cell (red). In contrast, LMP7 was not
detected in NEUN-positive neurons (red) at any time points
(Figure 2C). Thus, our findings indicate that immune cells are
the major producers for LMP7.
Expression of β1, β5 and 20S a subunits in the brains of
MCAO rats. Meanwhile,β1, β5 standard subunit as well as a
constitutive proteasome subunit of the 20S proteasome α
subunits (1,2,3,5,6,7) did not show a significant change in the
same brain region examined under the same conditions,
respectively (P40.10, compared with the sham-operated
group; P40.10 compared with the previous time point)
(Figure 3A−C).
Expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB in the brains of
MCAO rats. To investigate the potential link between
inflammation and immunoproteasome, we examined the
expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β
and NF-κB. Consistent with the time course of immunoproteasome
expression, TNF-α, IL-1β and Phospho-NF-κB p65
(NF-κB P-p65) increased as early as 4 h after reperfusion,
further increased at 24 h, peaked at 72 h and decreased at
7 days (* Po0.001, compared with the controls; #Po0.001
compared with the previous time point) (Figure 4A−C).
Correlation analysis revealed a significant association of
immunoproteasome with TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB p65.
LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and immunoproteasome
expression as well as proteasome activity in the brain
after MCAO. To determine the potential roles of LMP2 in the
brain after MCAO, lentivirus-mediated LMP2 shRNA (referred
to as LMP2-shRNA) or lentivirus vector carrying scrambled
shRNA (referred to as cont-shRNA) was injected stereotactically
into the right cortex and striatum in experimental
rats. Immunofluorescence labeling was used to reveal the
local injection of EGFP-tagged LMP2-shRNA into the right
cortex and striatum in experimental rats (Figure 5Aa−c).
Double immunostaining showed that the overwhelming
majority of LMP2-shRNA (green) was colocalized with
GFAP-positive astrocytes (red). Some LMP2-shRNA-
positive cells were colocalized with CD4+T lymphocytes and
with OX42-positive microglia/macrophage cells (red). In
contrast, there was not colocalization between NEUN-
positive neurons (red) and LMP2-shRNA positive cells at
any time point (Figure 5Ba−d). Western blot results demonstrated
that LMP2 knockdown markedly decreased the
protein levels of LMP2 and LMP7, decreased 66.5 and
58.9% compared with cont-shRNA group, but did not affect
the protein levels of β1, β5 standard subunit as well as 20S
proteasome α subunits (1,2,3,5,6,7) (Figure 5Ba−e). We
further measured the proteasome-dependent proteolytic
activities (the caspase-like (C-L) and chymotrypsin-like (CTL
) activities) after MCAO. MCAO induced a robust increase in
C-L and CT-L activities (about 12-fold and 13-fold increase
compared with the sham-operated controls, respectively),
whereas LMP2-shRNA caused nearly 75.5 and 78.6%
decrease in C-L and CT-L activities compared with contshRNA
group, respectively (*Po0.001, &P40.10, compared

compared with the cont-shRNA group) (Figure 5D).
LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and MG132 pretreatment
reduced infarction volumes in rats. To examine whether
inhibition of LMP2 and MG132 pretreatment reduces infarction
in MCAO model, LMP2-shRNAs and Cont-shRNA were
designed and cloned into a lentiviral vector to knockdown
stroke-induced LMP2 expression and the effects of LMP2
knockdown on infarct volume were then examined in vivo.
LMP2-ShRNA and MG132 were then injected stereotactically
into the right cortex and striatum before MCAO. The
transduction of LMP2-shRNA was confirmed by GFP
fluorescence and the infarction volume was determined by
using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.
LMP2 knockdown by significantly reduced infarction volumes
in ischemic rats. Compared with MCAO+vehicle group
(40.8%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral hemisphere), the
infarction volumes were reduced to 26.6% in MCAO+MG132
group (▲Po0.001, compared with MCAO+vehicle group)
(Figure 6A,C). Similarly, the infarction volumes were reduced
to 22.5% in LMP2-shRNA group compared with Cont-shRNA
group (39.7%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral hemispheric
) (*Po0.001, compared with Cont-shRNA group)
(Figure 6B,D). Furthermore, the infarction volumes were
smaller in LMP2-shRNA group than that in MG132 group
although the difference did not reach a significant level
(Figure 6) (#P40.10 compared with MG132 group).
LMP2 knockdown by shRNA reduced activation of
astrocytes and microglia after MCAO. To examine whether
inhibition of LMP2 reduces activation of astrocytes and

microglia in ischemic rats, LMP2-shRNA was injected
stereotactically into the right cortex and striatum before
MCAO. There were weak GFAP and OX42 immunoreactivities
for astrocytes and microglia in the cortex and striatum in
sham-operated control animals without MCAO. Following
MCAO, GFAP and OX42 immunoreactivities were evident in
the right cortex and striatum in ischemic animals receiving
control-shRNA. In contrast, the GFAP and OX42 immunoreactivities
were significantly reduced in ischemic animals
receiving LMP2-shRNA (*Po0.001, compared with the
sham-operated controls; #Po0.001 compared with the contshRNA
group) (Figure 7).
LMP2 knockdown by shRNA reduced the expression of
TNF-αand IL-1βafter MCAO. To examine whether inhibition
of LMP2 reduces the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in
ischemic rats, immunofluorescence labeling was used to
examine the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in ischemic
animals receiving either LMP2-shRNA or Cont-shRNA.
Immunofluorescence labeling revealed that both TNF-α and
IL-1β immunoreactivity was significantly upregulated in the
ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere compared with shamoperated
animals (Figure 8A). In contrast, LMP2 knockdown
by shRNA significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α and
IL-1β. Western blot confirmed that TNF-α and IL-1β protein
levels were reduced to 37.4 and 44.8% compared with ContshRNA
group, respectively (*Po0.001, compared with the
sham-operated controls; #Po0.001 compared with the contshRNA
group) (Figure 8B).
Effect of LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and MG132 on the
expression of NF-κB and ubiquitinated protein after
MCAO. To examine the effect of LMP2 knockdown by
shRNA and MG132 on the expression of NF-κB in ischemic
rats, immunofluorescence labeling was used to examine the
expression of NF-κB in ischemic animals receiving either
LMP2-shRNA or Cont-shRNA or MG132. The immunofluorescent
analysis of rat brain preparations showed that NF-κB
immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the ipsilateral
ischemic hemisphere compared with sham-operated animals.
In contrast, either LMP2 knockdown by shRNA or MG13
significantly reduced ischemia-induced expression of NF-κB
(Figure 9A). Western blot confirmed that NF-κB P-p65
protein levels was reduced to 55.1 and 31.3% in LMP2-
shRNA and MG132 groups, respectively, when compared
with the Cont-shRNA group (Figure 9B). Furthermore, the
NF-κB P-p65 protein levels were lower in MG132 group than
that in LMP2-shRNA group (#Po0.001 compared with the

Protein ubiquitination has been reported in ischemic
animals following brain ischemia.14 To examine the effects of
LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and MG132 on protein ubiquitination
in ischemic rats, western blot analysis was used to
quantitatively determine the levels of ubiquitinated proteins.
Consistently, we found that protein ubiquitination was significantly
increased after MCAO (*Po0.001, compared with
the sham-operated controls) (Figure 10). Compared with the
Cont-shRNA group, protein ubiquitination was increased
about 4.2-fold and 1.9-fold in MG132 and LMP2-shRNA
groups, respectively (#Po0.001 compared with the contshRNA

(Figure 10).
Discussion
The present study has examined the time course and cellular
distribution of immunoproteasome subunit LMP2 and LMP7
protein expression in a rat model of MCAO. We found that
LMP2 and LMP7 were robustly induced in inflammatory cells
in the ischemic brain as early as 4 h and lasted for 7 days
following ischemic stroke. These observations are in line with
the process of the brain’s inflammatory responses to ischemia,
indicating the strong association between immunoproteasome
and neuroinflammation under stroke context. Meanwhile, β1
and β5 standard subunits as well as constitutive proteasome
subunits of the 20 S proteasome α(1,2,3,5,6,7) did not show a
significant change in the same brain region examined under the
same conditions. Thus, our findings indicate the presence of
subtypes/intermediates type proteasomes in ischemic stroke.
More importantly, sh-RNA-mediated inhibition of LMP2 significantly
reduced infarction volume and attenuated inflammatory
reaction, suggesting that ischemia-induced upregulation of
immunoproteasome is detrimental.
Although immunoproteasome is predominantly present in
the immune cells, it is also present in non-immune response,
suggesting that immunoproteasome may also have nonimmune
functions.8,9,15 We found that LMP2 and LMP7 were
sparely present in glial-like cells in non-ischemic brain, which
is consistent with the notion that the brain is very low in
immune activity under physiological condition. In contrast,
LMP2 and LMP7 were robustly expressed in immune cells
such as astrocytes, microglia and T lymphocytes in ischemic
brain. In addition, the expression of LMP2 and LMP7 in
ischemic brain was redistributed from cytoplasm to nucleus,
indicating that ischemia induced the activation of immunoproteasome.
Furthermore, the pattern and time course of LMP2
and LMP7 expression were in line with the expression of
Figure 4 Expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB in the brains of MCAO rats. Western blot confirmed that protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and phospho-NF-κB p65(NF-κB
p-p65) increased as early as 4 h after reperfusion, further increased at 24 h, peaked at 72 h and decreased at 7 days, respectively (*Po0.001, compared with the controls;

inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB.
Thus, these results are in agreement with the previous studies
that immunoproteasome is highly expressed in immune cells
in brain diseases.11,16 Interestingly, although immunoproteasome
activity has been detected in different nervous tissue cell
types, the major cell types expressing immunoproteasome
vary in different neurological diseases. For example, neurons
have been reported to be a major source of LMP2 and LMP7 in
HD model. On the other hand, LMP2 and LMP7 have been
detected mainly in immune cells in an amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis model. Furthermore, immunoproteasome is exclusively
expressed in immune cells to exacerbate immunopathological
damage in a model of meningitis, suggesting a
critical role of immune cells in immunoproteasome-associated
injury in the inflamed brain.16 Several possibilities have
proposed to explain the discrepancy such as brain regionspecific
and pathological differences in the proteasome
induction response. Our results are in contrast to those of a
previous study suggesting that neurons are the major sources
of LMP2 and LMP7 in an ischemic stroke model. In that study,
LMP2 and LMP7 were detected in a mouse model of mild
transient ischemia (30 min).13 Although immunity and inflammation
are involved in all stages of the ischemic cascade, the
magnitude of inflammatory responses is associated with
severity of ischemia. Thus, a prolonged ischemic model as
used in the present study may be required to induce the
immunoproteasome-associated inflammatory responses.1
Immunoproteasome has been reported to have either a
beneficial or detrimental role depending on the experimental
context.8,10,16–18 In the present study, we further addressed
whether immunoproteasome represents a pro-survival
or a deleterious event under stroke context. The immunoproteasome
has three specific catalytic subunits including
LMP2, MECL-1 and LMP7. It is generally believed that
LMP2 is a critical component for proteasome activity in
that LMP2 is essential for the proper assembly of the
immunoproteasome.19 However, recent studies have shown
that there are different subtypes/intermediate type proteasomes
in several tissue and organs where the LMP7 subunit
can be incorporated along with standard catalytic
subunits.20,21 Thus, it is necessary to test the role of LMP2
as a regulator for i-proteasomes assembly in cerebral

ischemia. We further examined the effects of sh-RNA-
mediated knockdown of LMP2 on infarct volume. Animals
with shRNA-mediated LMP2 knockdown exhibited a significant
small infarct volume compared with control animals,
indicating a potent detrimental role of LMP2 in ischemic stroke.
Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LMP2 also
significantly reduced ischemia-activated immune cells including
microglia and astrocytes. Immunoproteasome has been
reported to exert its inflammatory action by regulation of
activation of NF-κB. It is not clear whether NF-κB is activated
by immunoproteasome during cerebral ischemia. To address
this question, we examined the effects of LMP2 knockdown on
the level of NF-κB after ischemia. We found that ischemia
dramatically increased NF-κB P65 expression whereas LMP2
knockdown significantly attenuated ischemia-induced NF-κB
P65 level. Similarly, LMP2 knockdown also significantly
reduced TNF-α and IL-1β level in ischemic animals. Given
that TNF-α and IL-1β are the downstream genes of NF-κB,
these results suggest that the LMP2 may mediate ischemic
damage through regulation of NF-κB.
The clinical uses of general proteasome inhibitors are often
limited by their side effects due to their non-selective inhibition
Figure 6 LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and MG132 pretreatment reduced infarction volumes in rats. The sections were stained by incubating them in a solution of 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and the infarcted brain tissue appeared white, whereas the non-infarcted region appeared red. LMP2 knockdown by shRNA significantly
reduced infarction volumes in ischemic stroke in rats. Compared with MCAO+vehicle group (40.8%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral hemispheric), the infarction volumes were
reduced to 26.6% in MCAO+MG132 group (▲Po0.001, compared with MCAO+vehicle group) (a and c). Similarly, the infarction volumes were reduced to 22.5% in
LMP2-shRNA group compared with Cont-shRNA group (39.7%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral hemispheric) (*Po0.001, compared with Cont-shRNA group) (b and d).
The infarction volumes were smaller in LMP2-shRNA group than that in MG132 group although the difference did not reach a significant level (#P40.10 compared with MG132
group). Five rats in each group were used for TTC

of protein degradation.6 To address whether selective
inhibition of LMP2 immunoproteasome reduces side effects,
we examined the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown of
LMP2 on proteolytic activities and polyubiquitylated proteins.
Ischemia induced a robust increase in C-L and CT-L activities
whereas LMP2 knockdown caused nearly 6-fold decrease in
C-L and CT-L activities compared with the control group.
Consequently, polyubiquitylated proteins were significantly
accumulated in animals with LMP2 knockdown. Interestingly,
LMP2 knockdown caused much less accumulation of polyubiquitylated
proteins compared with general proteasome
inhibitor MG132 treatment although both LMP2 knockdown
and MG132 pretreatment achieved similar reduction of
infarction volumes in ischemic rats. Collectively, these results
suggest that LMP2 knockdown protects against ischemic
insult without severely disturbing overall proteasome function.
However, the present study has several limitations. For
example, we could not completely rule out the possible role
of non-inflammatory functions of immunoproteasome in
ischemic stroke. Thus, further studies are required to understand
fully the mechanism by which immunoproteasome
exacerbates ischemic injury. In addition, MG132 is a nonselective
proteasome inhibitor. Thus, MG132-induced
protection may be in part related to inhibition of standard
proteasomes. Future study using specific immunoproteasome
inhibitors is warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of
specific immunoproteasome inhibitors in cerebral ischemia.
Nevertheless, the present data suggest that augmentation of
immunoproteasome may be involved in regulating inflammation
cytokines production via regulating activation of NF-κBin
ischemia stroke whereas selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome
subunit affords a strong reduction of infarction
volumes and a suppression of proinflammatory cytokines after
MCAO, indicating that immunoproteasome-specific inhibitor
might be an effective anti-inflammation agent for stroke
treatment.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that both
LMP2 and LMP7 are mainly produced from inflammatory cells
and these two immunoproteasome units also undergo
time-dependent changes after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
In addition, augmentation of immunoproteasome may be
potentially involved in inflammatory pathophysiological
mechanism of ischemia stroke. We also infirm that selective
inhibition of the immunoproteasome subunit offers a strong
reduction of infarction volumes and a suppression of proinflammatory
cytokines after MCAO. We postulate that interfering
with immunoproteasome with highly selective proteasome
inhibitor may be a new paradigm for acute treatment of stroke,
as well as other neurological diseases.
Figure 7 LMP2 knockdown by shRNA reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia after MCAO. Following MCAO, GFAP and OX42 immunoreactivities were evident inthe
right cortex and striatum in ischemic animals receiving control-ShRNA compared with sham-operated control animals. In contrast, the GFAP and OX42 immunoreactivities were
significantly reduced in ischemic animals receiving LMP2-shRNA (*Po0.001, compared with the sham-operated controls; #Po0.001 compared with the cont-shRNA group).

Materials and Methods
Ethical approval. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animal of the National Institute of Health, Publication No. 80-23,
revised 1996) and performed to comply with the ARRIVE (Animal Research:
Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (10 weeks
old) weighing 250–300 g were purchased from the Center for Experimental
Animals of Sun Yat-Sen University. Animals were maintained in a temperature
controlled room, on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
They were housed five per cage to maintain social interaction. To reduce the
animal’s stress level, the same operator performed all steps of experiments.
Efforts were made to reduce the number of rats. A total of 126 rats were used in
the completion of this study, and finally only 90 rats were involved in this
experiment. Rats were randomly assigned into six groups: sham-operated control
group (sham, n=10), MCAO group (MCAO, n=40), MCAO+lentivirus-mediated
LMP2 shRNA (referred to as LMP2-shRNA) (LMP2-shRNA, n=10), MCAO
+lentivirus vector carrying scrambled shRNA (referred to as Cont-shRNA)
(Cont-shRNA, n=10), MCAO+MG132 group (MG132, n=10) and MCAO+vehicle
group (vehicle, n=10).
MCAO model. Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 10%
chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg body weight) and subjected to MCAO as described
previously, with minor modifications.22 In brief, a midline neck incision was made,
and the right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. The ECA was tied. A 4-0 monofilament
nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) with a rounded tip was
aseptically inserted from the right CCA to the ICA through the stump of the ECA and
gently advanced to occlude the MCA. Recirculation/reperfusion of cerebral blood
flow was allowed by gently removing the monofilament after 1-h ischemia, followed
by different time intervals of reperfusion. In sham-operated animals, all procedures
except occlusion of the MCA were performed. Core body temperatures were
monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37 °C during the whole procedure.
Following surgery, rats were allowed to recover spontaneous breathing and were
kept in their cages with free access to food and water. To evaluate impairment of
neuronal function after stroke, neurologic examinations were performed 2, 4 and 8 h
after the onset of occlusion and then daily until killing by a blinded examiner who
used a modified scoring system based on that developed by Longa et al.22 The
scoring system used is as follows: 0, no deficits; 1, difficulty in fully extending
the contralateral forelimb; 2, unable to extend the contralateral forelimb; 3, circling to
the contralateral side; 4, falling to the contralateral side; 5, did not walk
spontaneously and displayed a depressed level of consciousness.
Lentiviral construction preparation and injection. Four shRNA
sequences targeting rat LMP2 (GenBank, Psmb9, NM_012708) and a negative
control sequence were constructed by Genechem (Shanghai, China). The bestperforming
LMP2 shRNA sequence was CCTGGTCACCATTACAGCT, and the
negative control scrambled shRNA sequence was CCATCATGGCTGTGGAATT.
ShRNAs were inserted into a hU6-MCS-CMV-EGFP lentivirus vector containing a
CMV-driven EGFP reporter gene and a U6 promoter upstream of restriction sites
(HpaI and XhoI) (Genechem, China). All constructs were confirmed by sequence
analysis. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with
the aid of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Irvine, CA, USA, 11668-500) according to
standard protocols. Virus titers, expressed as transducing units (TU) per milliliter,
were determined by measuring GFP expression in 293T cells, which were

immunoreactivity was significantly upregulated in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere compared with sham-operated animals. In contrast, LMP2 knockdown by shRNA
significantly reduced the expression of TNF-αand IL-1β(A). Five rats in each group were used for immunofluorescent assays (n=5). (b) Western blot confirmed that TNF-αand
IL-1β protein levels were reduced to 37.4 and 44.8% compared with the Cont-shRNA group, respectively (*Po0.001, compared with the sham-operated controls; #Po0.001

transduced with serial dilutions of concentrated lentivirus. The titers were
approximately 4 × 109TU/ml. Lentivirus preparations were infused stereotactically
into the ipsilateral hemispheric region 1 h before MCAO. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized as above and placed on a stereotactic apparatus. ShRNA preparations
were delivered into the right ishcemia region using a 15-ml syringe at the following
coordinates (10μl/per site): bregma backward 1 mm, 15 mm lateral, 4 mm
dorsoventral. The rats were allowed to recover for up to 3 days to enable sufficient
gene expression.
Detection of fluorescence labeled LMP2-shRNA. At 72 h after
injection, rats were killed under deep anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate (5 ml/
kg body weight, IP) and then transcardially perfused with 0.9% sodium chloride at
4 °C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4). Brains were removed, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cryosections
were prepared. Fluorescence was analysed using a fluorescence microscope
(BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Drug administration. MG132 (dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulphoxide in saline;
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and vehicle (2% dimethyl sulphoxide in saline) were
stereotactically injected into the ipsilateral hemispheric region 1 h before MCAO. In
brief, rats were anesthetized as above and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus and
fixed accordingly. The skull was exposed and a hole was drilled in the skull overlying
the right hemisphere at the following coordinates: bregma backward 1 mm, 15 mm
lateral and 4 mm dorsoventral. In all, 10μl of either MG132 (2 mg/kg body weight)
or 2% dimethyl sulphoxide in saline (vehicle control animals) was delivered into the
right ishcemia region using a 15-ml syringe. The rats were allowed to recover for up
to 3 days to enable sufficient gene expression. Importantly, the doses of MG132
used in the present study were chosen from previous experiments.
Tissue preparation. At 4, 24, 72 h and 7 days after reperfusion, five rats from
each group were killed under deep anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate (5 ml/kg
body weight, IP) and then transcardially perfused with 0.9% sodium chloride at 4 °C
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were then
removed, kept in the same fixative for 48 h at 4 °C and cryoprotected in serial PBS
isopropanol sucrose solutions (20 and 30%) at 4 °C until brains sank. Coronal
sections (10μm) were cut on a cryostat (CM1900; Leica, Heidelberger, Germany)
and used for immunofluorescent staining.
Measurement of cerebral infarction volume. The measurement of
cerebral infarct volume was performed as previously described.5,23,24 From each rat
brain, analysis of ischemic damage included core infarct volume from both cortical
and subcortical brain regions. The animals were euthanized 72 h after reperfusion
by chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, IP) anesthesia overdose. The brains were rapidly
dissected out and the forebrains were cut into six coronal sections (2 mm thick). The
sections were stained by incubating them in a solution of 2% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C for 20 min. Then, the infarcted brain tissue appeared
Figure 9 Effect of LMP2 knockdown by shRNA and MG132 on the expression of NF-κB after MCAO. (a) The immunofluorescent showed that NF-κB immunoreactivity was
significantly increased in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere compared with sham-operated animals. In contrast, either LMP2 knockdown by shRNA or MG13 significantly

protein levels was reduced to 55.1 and 31.3% in LMP2-ShRNA and MG132 groups, respectively, when compared with the Cont-shRNA group. However, the NF-κB p-p65 protein
levels were lower in MG132 group than that in LMP2-shRNA group (#Po0.001 compared with the cont-shRNA group; &Po0.001 compared with the MG132 group) (b). Five rats
in each group were used for western blot (n=5). Scale bars=50μm.

white, whereas the non-infarcted region appeared red. The sections were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and then digitized. The cross-sectional areas with or without
infarction in each brain slice were measured using Image J analysis software
(ImageJ 1.6q software, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA).
Infarct volume was determined by integrating the crosssectional area of infarction at
each stereotaxic level and the thickness of slice according to the following formula:
V=t×(A1+A2+…An). V is the infarct volume (mm3), t is the thickness of slice and
A is the infarct area (mm2). Correction for edema of infarct area was performed as
described by Lin et al.25
Immunofluorescent labeling. For immunofluorescent assays, frozen
sections (10μm) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica, CM1900) according to
standard procedures. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-LMP2 (1 : 400;
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-LMP7 (1 : 300; Abcam), mouse anti-NeuN
(1 : 400; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), mouse anti-rat GFAP (1 : 800; Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), mouse anti-rat OX-42 (1 : 300; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), mouse anti-CD31 (1 : 100; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK),
mouse anti-CD4 (1 : 100; AbD Serotec), goat anti-rat-TNF-a (1 : 1000; R&D
systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), goat anti-rat-IL-1β (1 : 1000; R&D Systems).
Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously.26,27 Briefly, sections
were pre-incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v) in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min,
followed by blocking in 10% normal goat serum (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories,
Inc., Maryland, WA, USA) or 1% bovine serum albumin (MPBIO, Santa Ana, CA,
USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C
with primary antibodies diluted in primary antibody diluents (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark). After rinsing in 0.01 M PBS (3 × 5 min), sections were incubated with
FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1 : 250; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) or
Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment (1 : 1000;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology) in
0.01 M PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, sections were thoroughly washed
(3 × 5 minutes). If necessary, sections were counterstained for nuclei with 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; 1 : 1000; Roche, Mannheim,
Germany), and then mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) before
imaging. Fluorescence signal was detected with a microscope (BX51; Olympus).
Negative control sections were incubated with PBS instead of primary antibodies
and showed no positive staining. Five rats in each group were used for
immunofluorescent assays (n=5).
Western blot analyses. Rats were killed as above and then transcardially
perfused with 0.9% sodium chloride at 4 °C. Brains were then removed, the
ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum around the infarct area was rapidly
dissected from the brain tissue and then homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Thermo
Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Brain lysates were centrifuged (16 400 rpm for 30 min), and then protein
concentrations were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay kit
(Thermo Scientific Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Soluble
protein (50μg) was separated by 4–20% gradient SDS/PAGE (sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules,
CA, USA) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore).
Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20
(TBST) and 5% non-fat milk (MERBCON, Bedford, MA, USA, BCR685). The
membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies used
were as follows: rabbit anti-LMP2 (1 : 2000; Abcam), rabbit anti-LMP7 (1 : 1000;
Abcam), mouse anti-20 S alpha subunits (1,2,3,5,6,7) (1 : 500; Abcam), rabbit anti-
20 S proteasome β1, rabbit anti-20 S proteasome β5 (1 : 200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rat anti-interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ß)
(1 : 1000; Abcam), Phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) (93H1) rabbit monoclonal
antibody (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), goat anti-tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α) (1 : 5000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), mouse monoclonal
anti-β-actin (1 : 3000; Proteintech Group Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) served as the
housekeeping protein. Membranes were exposed to the secondary antibodies
diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature: horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1 : 6000; EarthOx Life Sciences, San Francisco,
CA, USA), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1 : 3000; Cell Signaling Technology), or
HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (1 : 3000; Invitrogen). Immunoreactivity
was detected with Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) for 5 min
and then exposed to Kodak X-OMAT films. The exposed X-ray films were scanned.
The optical densities were normalized to those of β-actin and calculated as target
protein expression/β-actin expression ratios (ImageJ 1.42q software, U.S. National
Institutes of Health). Five rats in each group were used for western blot (n=5).
Measurement of 20S proteasome activity in brain lysates. The
remaining portions of the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum around the infarct
area samples (≈50 mg) were individually homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Thermo
Scientific Pierce) by crushing with mortar and pestle on ice, then dispersed with a
sonicator (Kontes micro-ultrasonic cell disrupter). Samples were centrifuged (16
400 rpm for 30 min), and then protein concentrations were determined by using a

fold and 1.9-fold in MG132 and LMP2-shRNA groups, respectively (#Po0.001 compared with the cont-shRNA group; &Po0.001 compared with the MG132 group). Five rats in
each group were used for western blot (n=5)

bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce) according to
the manufacturer's instructions before storage at −80 °C. Proteasome activity
assays were performed as previously reported,28–30 using the Proteasome Activity
Assay Kit (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA). The detection of proteolytic activity is
based on the release of free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorophore. In brief,
to determine chymotrypsin-and caspase-like activity, 150 and 200μg of protein,
respectively, was incubated in assay buffer including 250 mmol/L HEPES HCl, pH
7.5, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
(w/v), with 50μmol/L substrate (Suc- LLVY-AMC for Ch-T-L activity and Boc-LAAAMC
for T-L activity) in a final volume of 100μl in 96-well plates for 1 h at 37 °C
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chemicon). Fluorescence of substrate
cleavage was determined at 37 °C in a spectrofluorometer (Thermo Electron,
Waltham, MA, USA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm,
respectively. Proteasome activities for samples were expressed as relative
fluorescence units/min/μg brain tissue. Several controls were performed in parallel
with measurement of proteasome activity, including standard curves using AMC,
protein-free blanks and substrate-only measures. The analyses were conducted in
the presence of a specific inhibitor of the proteasome lactacystin (50–200μmol/L) to
ensure the specificity of the proteasome assays.28,30–32 Five rats in each group
were used for measurement of 20S proteasome activity (n=5).
Image analysis and quantification. All histological images were analyzed
with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring,
MD, USA) by one blinded assessor. The number of immunostaining positive cells
was counted using Image-Pro Plus image analysis software in nine comparable,
non-overlapping fields (425 × 320μm; 3 fields per section × 3 sections per rat) under
× 400 magnification and was presented as the average cell number per field on
each section.26,27
Statistical analysis. Results were expressed by means±s.d. Statistical
analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by LSD test for
post hoc analysis. Differences were considered as significant when Po0.05.
