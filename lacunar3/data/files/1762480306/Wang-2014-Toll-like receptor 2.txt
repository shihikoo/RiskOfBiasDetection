Objective: Inflammatory injury plays a critical role in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury.
However, the upstream events that initiate inflammatory responses following ICH remain elusive. Our previous studies
suggested that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be the upstream signal that triggers inflammatory injury in ICH. In
addition, recent clinical findings indicated that both TLR2 and TLR4 may participate in ICH-induced brain injury. However
, it is unclear how TLR2 functions in ICH-induced inflammatory injury and how TLR2 interacts with TLR4.
Methods: The role of TLR2 and TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization in ICH-induced inflammatory injury was investigated
in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH.
Results: TLR2 mediated ICH-induced inflammatory injury, which forms a heterodimer with TLR4 in both in vivo and in
vitro models of ICH. Hemoglobin (Hb), but not other blood components, triggered inflammatory injury in ICH via
assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), but not TRIF (Toll/
IR-1 domain–containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta), was required for ICH-induced TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization.
Mutation of MyD88 Arg196 abolished the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization.
Interpretation: Our results suggest that a novel TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer induced by Hb initiates inflammatory injury
in ICH. Interfering with the assembly of the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer may be a novel target for developing effective
treatment of ICH.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high
rates of mortality and morbidity.1,2 Currently, there is
no effective therapy to improve survival rate nor treatment
to improve the quality of life for survivors.3–5
Increasing evidence indicates that secondary injury following
ICH plays an important role in the neurological
deterioration experienced by patients with ICH.6–8
Innate immunity and inflammatory responses have
been found to play a critical role in ICH-induced secondary
brain injury.9–13 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that
recognize distinct pathogen-associated and damageassociated
molecular patterns play a key role in innate
immunity and inflammatory responses.14–20 Recently
studies have suggested that TLR4 may be the upstream
signal that triggers inflammatory injury in ICH.21,22
Moreover, increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in
peripheral monocytes was associated with poor outcome
in patients with ICH,23 suggesting that both TLR2 and
TLR4 participate in ICH-induced brain injury. However,
it remains unclear how TLR2 functions in ICH-induced
inflammatory injuries, and whether TLR2 interacts with
TLR4 in ICH. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the
role of TLR2 and TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization in
ICH-induced inflammatory injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals
C57BL/6 mice (male, 20–23g) were obtained from the Animal
Center of the Third Military Medical University (TMMU;
Chongqing, China). TLR22/2, TLR12/2, MyD882/2, and
TRIF2/2 mice (21–22g) were from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME), and TLR62/2 mice were provided by Dr F.
Wang from TMMU. All knockout mice were backcrossed onto
a C57BL/6 background. TLR2/TLR4 double-knockout mice
(TLR22/2/TLR42/2) were generated by hybridization of
TLR22/2 and TLR42/2 mice. Experiments were conducted in
accordance with animal care guidelines of the Animal Ethics
Committee of TMMU and ARRIVE (Animal Research:
Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.
ICH Model
An autologous blood ICH model or collagenase ICH model
was performed as previously reported.24,25 Whole blood (30ll),
the same volume of hemoglobin (Hb; 20lM; Sigma, St Louis,
MO), bacterial collagenase (0.075U in 1.0ll sterile saline;
Sigma), or saline was injected into the striatum using a syringe
pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA).
Cell Culture and Transwell Experiments
Microglia and neurons were cultured as previously
reported.21,26 For transwell experiments, microglia were plated
onto transwell inserts, treated with various conditions, then
transferred to neuron-enriched cultures. After 36 hours,
microglia were removed and neurons were stained with mouse
anti–bIII-tubulin antibody, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat
antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Hoechst (all from
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Neurons were imaged using
a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Neuron survival was determined using methylthiazol tetrazolium
assays.27
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed per
the manufacturer’s instructions (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian,
China). Detection of b-actin was used as an internal control.
The primers were as listed in Table 1. Reaction conditions were
as follows: 40 cycles of 95C for 30 seconds, 95C for 10 seconds
, and 60C for 30 seconds, followed by an incubation at
72C for 1 minute and 95C for 1 minute. Relative levels of
mRNA expression were calculated using the 22DDCTmethod.
Western Blot
Proteins from perihematomal tissues or cultured microglia were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were incubated
with mouse antimouse TLR2 antibodies (mouse monoclonal
antibody to TLR2, 1:200) or TLR4 antibody (rabbit polyclonal
antibody to TLR4, 1:400) or MyD88 antibody (rabbit polyclonal
to MyD88, 1:400; all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at
4C overnight. Detection of b-actin was used as a loading control
, and membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase
–conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibodies (1:300;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 25C for 1.5
hour. Bound antibodies were visualized using a chemiluminescence
detection system.
Immunofluorescence, TUNEL, and Fluoro-Jade
Staining
For Immunofluorescence, brain tissue sections (25lm) or cultured
microglia were incubated with primary antibodies at 4C
overnight after being blocked with goat serum, then washed
and incubated with second antibodies at 25C for 1 hour (the
antibodies were as listed in Table 2). An In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim,
Germany) was used for TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling
) staining, and neuronal degeneration was detected with
Fluoro-Jade staining (Millipore, Billerica, MA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were examined using a
confocal microscope (Olympus). Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe
Systems, San Jose, CA) were used for photomicrograph combination
and mild contrast and brightness adjustment.
Flow Cytometry
Brain tissues were dissociated into single-cell suspensions using
gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) as previously described.28 Suspensions passed
through a magnetic column, then were incubated with
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (antimouse TLR2
[CD282]-PE, antimouse CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-CD45-
APC, anti-GFAP Alexa Fluor 488 [all from eBioscience, San
Diego, CA], and anti-b-III Tubulin-PerCP [R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN]) for 30 minutes at 4C. To investigate
inflammatory infiltrates following ICH, cells were incubated
with 50ll Fc Block (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) as

minutes at 4C with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies as follows
: CD45-APC, CD11b-PerCp Cy5.5, CD11c-PECy7,
CD3-FITC, CD19-FITC, NK1.1-FITC, Gr-1-PE (eBioscience
), and Ly6G-v450 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry
analysis was performed using a BD verse flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Brain Water Content
The brain water content (BWC) was detected as previously
reported.21,24
Neurologic Deficit Score
A battery of behavioral tests were used to assess neurological
deficits as previously reported.21,29 Scoring was performed by 2
trained investigators who were blind to animal grouping, and
the mean score of the subscales was the final score of each
mouse.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Brian tissues or cells were centrifuged and concentrations of
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)21b, and IL-6
were detected in the supernatant using a kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D).
Determination of Nitric Oxide Content
Nitric oxide (NO) content in culture medium was determined
using a Griess reaction kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer
’s directions.
HEK293 Cells and Nuclear Factor j B Activity
HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cotransfected with
a nuclear factor j B (NFjB)-luciferase reporter gene (Addgene.org
, plasmid 13642) and pcDNA3.1 vectors containing
TLR2-YFP, TLR4-YFP, or TLR1-YFP (Addgene.org, plasmids
13016, 13018, and 13014). After 48 hours, cells were stimulated
with various conditions for 12 hours. NF-jB activity was
measured using a Dual Luciferase Assay Reporter System
(Promega, Madison, WI).
A cDNA encoding the Toll/IR-1 (TIR) domain of
MyD88 (amino acid residues 148–296) that was tagged at the
N-terminus with a myc-epitope was cloned into the plasmid vector
pcDNA3.1. Mutations of the MyD88 TIR domain
(MyD88R196A or MyD88R288A) were generated using the GeneE-
ditor in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Promega).30,31
Twenty-four hours after cotransfection of NF-jB–luciferase
reporter gene and TLR4 or TLR2, equivalent cells were transfected
with pcDNA3.11MyD88 or pcDNA3.11MyD88R196A,
or pcDNA3.11MyD88R288A. After transfection, the cells were
stimulated with Hb (20lM) and incubated for 12 hours to
detect the NF-jBactivity.
Immunoprecipitation
Perihematomal tissue from mice or cultured cells were solubilized
on ice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer.
Extracted protein was then incubated with antimouse or antihuman
TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 antibodies, or IgG as a
control (Abcam), at 4C overnight, followed by an agaroseconjugated
secondary antibody for 2 hours. The resulting immunoprecipitates
were centrifuged and resuspended in SDS-PAGE
buffer. Protein expression was determined by Western blot.
Mammalian Cell Double-Hybrid System
The experiment procedure was conducted according to the
instructions of the Clontech Corporation (Takara Bio, Mountain
View, CA). By using pcDNA3.1 vectors containing TLR2-
YFP and TLR4-YFP (Addgene.org), TLR2 and TLR4 genes
were cloned into pM and pVP16 mammalian cell doublehybrid
vectors. The vector was transfected to HEK293 cell
using a Ca

precipitation method. After 12 hours of
stimulation with Hb (20lM), the activity of luciferase was
detected by Fluorescence Detector (RF-10A; Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan), which was conducted according to luciferase activity kit
instructions (Promega).

MyD88-siRNA in Microglia
Transfection experiments with mouse MyD88-siRNA (0.1nmol,
stealth siRNA, Life Technologies) and negative control
(0.1nmol) siRNA were performed using Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The sense and antisense strands of MyD88-siRNA were 50-GA
CUGAUUCCUAUUAAAUTtt-30 and 50-UAUUUAAUAGGA
AUCAGUCgc-30 (Life Technologies). The effect of silencing
was detected by Western blot. Microglia treated with MyD88-
siRNA was stimulated with Hb (20lM) for 12 hours. The
supernatant and cells were collected for further detection.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS v11.5 software (IBM,
Armonk, NY), and all values are presented as the mean6standard
error. Student t test and 1-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Scheffe post hoc test were used to compare
differences between 2 and 3 groups, respectively. Twoway
ANOVA was performed to study the effects of multiple
factors. The chi-square test was used to compare differences in
the death rate between groups. The Tukey–Kraner post-test was
used for multiple comparison analyses. A probability value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
ICH Upregulates TLR2 Expression in
Perihematomal Tissues
Mice were sacrificed 6 hours, 1 day, 3 day, and 5 days
after ICH to obtain perihematomal tissues (Fig 1). Total
RNA and protein were collected from perihematomal tissues
to detect expression of TLR2. Both real-time PCR
and Western blot assays detected significantly higher levels
of TLR2 in ICH tissues compared with sham controls.
Expression of TLR2 by microglia, astrocytes, and
neurons present in dissociated perihematomal tissues
obtained 3 days after ICH were analyzed by flow cytometry.
The highest levels of TLR2 expression were detected
in microglia, whereas levels were unchanged in neurons.
Similar results were obtained in fluorescence microscopy
studies of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Taken

together, these results suggest that TLR2 may contribute
to ICH-induced brain injury.
TLR2 Mediates ICH-Induced Inflammatory Injury
To further investigate the role of TLR2 in ICH-induced
inflammatory injury, TLR22/2, TLR12/2, TLR62/2,
and wild-type (WT) mice were compared. TLR22/2
mice exhibited significantly less brain edema up to 5
days after ICH (Fig 2). They had significantly lower levels
of proinflammatory cytokines and lower neurologic
deficit scores (NDS) but higher levels of antiinflammatory
cytokine. To further confirm the role of
TLR2 in ICH-induced injury, the NDS of TLR22/2
mice were still lower than those of WT mice in

collagenase models. In addition, these ICH-induced
effects were TLR2 specific, because TLR12/2 or TLR62/
2 mice did not exhibit a similar phenotype following
ICH. TLR22/2 mice had less neuronal apoptosis and
degeneration, whereas this was not the case in TLR12/2
or TLR62/2 mice (Fig 3A, B).
Blood-derived inflammatory cells present in perihematomal
tissues were also quantitated using flow cytometry.
In TLR22/2 mice, all of these cell types were present
at significantly lower levels compared with control mice
(see Fig 3C, Table 3), suggesting that TLR2 is important
for the induction of inflammatory cell infiltration into
perihematomal tissues following ICH.
Activation of TLR2 by Hb Mediates ICH-Induced
Inflammatory Injury
To identify the blood components that activate TLR2,
cultured microglia were treated with whole blood, whole
blood lysate, whole blood without red blood cells
(RBCs), RBCs, or an RBC lysate solution. In Western
blot assays, higher levels of TLR2 expression were
detected for microglia treated with whole blood lysate
and RBC lysate solution, suggesting that RBC lysate are
responsible for upregulation of TLR2 expression (Fig 4).
When cultured microglia were treated with RBC components
and their metabolic products, only Hb was found
to significantly increase TLR2 expression in a dosedependent
manner. In addition, Hb promoted microglial
activation, resulting in a significant increase in the production
of inflammatory cytokines, and the response to
hemin was significantly less than that to Hb. These
effects were blocked in TLR22/2 mice, and were also
blocked in WT mice treated with an anti-TLR2 antibody.
Moreover, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blocker polymyxin
B did not affect Hb-induced microglial activation,
thereby excluding the possibility of LPS contamination.
These results suggest that TLR2 does not mediate
hemin-induced microglial activation. However, it is possible
that TLR2 mediates microglial activation based on
the observation that microglial activation induced by a
TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4 or Pam2CGDPKHPKSF
(FSL-1), was blocked in TLR22/2 mice and with anti-
TLR2 antibodies.
In transwell experiments, when cultured microglia
were treated with Hb then placed in transwells above
neuron-enriched cultures (WT), a significant decrease in
neuron survival was observed and quantitated, whereas
microglia from TLR22/2 mice had significantly
improved neuronal survival (Fig 5A). These results suggest
that expression of TLR2 by microglia mediates Hbinduced
neuronal death.
To investigate the role of Hb in TLR2-mediated
brain injury following ICH, Hb or saline was stereotactically
injected into the striatum of WT and TLR22/2
mice. Three days later, compared with the corresponding
sham controls or TLR22/2 mice, WT mice had a significant
increase in brain edema, accompanied by an increase
in neurologic deficits, a greater number of apoptosis neurons
, increased neuronal degeneration, and higher concentrations
of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 (see Fig 5B–F).
Hb Promotes TLR2/TLR4 Heterodimer
Formation to Induce Inflammatory Injury
To examine the association between TLR2 and TLR4 in
vivo, immunoprecipitation assays were performed to
detect TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation in perihematomal
tissues collected from WT mice. In these assays,
TLR2/TLR6, TLR1/TLR2, or TLR1/TLR4 heterodimer
formation was not detected. However, TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer
formation was detected, with the highest levels
1 day after ICH (Fig 6A). Immunofluorescence assays
detected overlay of TLR2 and TLR4 distribution in perihematomal
tissues (see Fig 6B).
The immunoprecipitation results indicated that
only whole blood lysate and RBC lysate solutions
induced heterodimer formation in cell culture (see Fig
6). In addition, of the RBC components tested, only Hb
was found to promote heterodimer formation and colocalization
of TLR2 and TLR4 in cultured microglia.
Immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrated that Hb

could induce TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation in
mice injected with Hb, and in HEK 293 cells expressing
TLR2 and TLR4.
To further confirm the heterodimerization of TLR2
and TLR4, a mammalian cells double-hybrid system was
used to detect the interaction of TLR2 and TLR4. Western
blot results showed the overexpression of TLR2 or
TLR4 in transfected HEK293 cells (see Fig 6H). The
double-hybrid results indicated that there is no autotranscriptional
activity of TLR2 or TLR4 (see Fig 6I). However
, the luciferase activity was significantly increased
only when TLR2 and TLR4 cotransfected into cells,
especially when the cells were treated with Hb, which
indicates an interaction of TLR2 and TLR4, and suggests
that TLR2/TLR4 may form a heterodimer.
To investigate the cooperative signaling between
TLR2 and TLR4 that is induced by Hb, NF-jB activity 
was assayed in HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 and TLR4.
For HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 or TLR4, Hb did not
significantly activate NF-jB. This was not due to poor
expression of TLR2 or TLR4, because LPS, Pams3CSK4,
and FSL-1 were found to activate NF-jB in these cells

TLR2 and TLR4, treatment with Hb significantly
increased NF-jB activation. Moreover, signaling cooperation
between TLR2 and TLR4 was specific, because Hb
did not induce NF-jB activation in cells expressing
TLR1, TLR1-TLR2, or TLR1-TLR4 (see Fig 7A).

inflammatory injury in TLR22/2/TLR42/2 (Western
blot identification, see Fig 7B) mice. The results demonstrated
that BWC, NDS, and proinflammatory cytokines
decreased significantly in TLR22/2/TLR42/2 mice 3
days after ICH (see Fig 7C–E).
To investigate potential downstream signaling molecules
of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation, immunoprecipitation
assays were performed in WT, MyD882/2,
and TRIF2/2 mice. Twenty-four hours after ICH,
TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation was detected in WT
and TRIF2/2 mice, yet not in MyD882/2 mice (Fig 8A,
B), suggesting that MyD88 is critical for TLR2/TLR4
heterodimer formation.
To further investigate how MyD88 regulates TLR2-
TLR4 complex formation, we mutated MyD88 to identify
sequences essential for TLR2-TLR4 heterodimerization. It
is reported that MyD88 Arg196 and MyD88 Arg288 are
essential for TLR signaling.30,31 MyD88R196A, but not
MyD88R288A, impaired the ability of MyD88 to induce 
NF-jB–dependent luciferase gene expression in HEK293
cells coexpressing TLR2 and TLR4 (see Fig 8C). Moreover
, Hb induced coprecipitation of TLR2 and TLR4 in
HEK293 cells coexpressing WT MyD88 or MyD88R288A,
not MyD88R196A (see Fig 8D). These data identified
MyD88 Arg196 as a critical regulator of TLR2-TLR4
dimerization and signaling.
To investigate the role of MyD88 in ICH-induced
inflammatory injury by TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer,
MyD88-siRNA (Western blot identification, Fig 9A) was
used to identify the changes of inflammatory reaction in
Hb-stimulated microglia. It demonstrated a significant
decrease in the production of inflammatory cytokines
and NO in microglia treated with MyD88-siRNA (see
Fig 9B). Additionally, NDS, BWC, and inflammatory
cytokines decreased significantly in MyD882/2 mice 3
days after ICH (see Fig 9C–E). The results suggested
that MyD88 plays an important role in inflammatory
injury induced by the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer.
Discussion
In the present study, Hb released from RBCs promoted
assembly of a novel TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer, which was
required for ICH-induced inflammatory injury and was
associated with neurological deficits. Thus, formation of
the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer may represent an upstream
event that initiates inflammatory injury in ICH.

In our study, TLR2 was upregulated following
ICH by Hb. Furthermore, a key finding was that Hb
triggered TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation in a
MyD88-dependent manner. However, whereas TLR2/
TLR4 heterodimer formation was dependent on the
presence of Hb, it was not dependent on the overexpression
of both TLR2 and TLR4, because TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers
did not form in the absence of Hb treatment
in HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR2 and TLR4, or in
MyD882/2 mice with ICH. Increased expression of
TLR2 has also been associated with cerebral ischemia.32
However, the finding in the present study that Hb is
required for TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation may be
unique for ICH. In addition, because RBCs, the main
component of a hematoma, typically lyse within days
and release Hb,10 our data reveal a role for Hb in
initiating the assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers as
an early signaling event that triggers ICH-induced
inflammatory injury.
In this study, a previously uncharacterized TLR heterodimer
composed of TLR2 and TLR4 was investigated.
This heterodimer appears to sense the hematoma component
, Hb, rather than other blood components, has the
capacity to initiate inflammatory injury during ICH.
Additional considerations are that: (1) TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers
did not assemble due to mechanical pressure,
because the same injection volume was applied to control
and experimental groups, and heterodimerization was not
detected in the control groups; (2) RBC lysate solution,
and not RBCs or whole blood without RBCs, was able
to induce assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers in
cultured microglia, indicating that RBC components
promote heterodimer formation; (3) in cultured microglia
, Hb induced assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers;
and (4) only the injection of Hb into the brain of mice
promoted heterodimer formation.
Typically, activation of TLR2 recruits MyD88 to
initiate downstream signaling events. For TLR4, activation
involves the recruitment of 2 distinct adaptor proteins
, MyD88 and TRIF, which subsequently activate
NF-jB and interferon regulatory transcription factor 3,
respectively.14–16 It has been reported that the initial
dimerization of TLRs recruits 2 MyD88 proteins, and
these interactions accelerate or stabilize the dimerization
event.33 These data would suggest that intracellular adaptor
proteins are important for the formation of dimers.
Knockout of MyD88, a common downstream adaptor
protein for TLRs, inhibited ICH-induced TLR2/TLR4
heterodimer formation. In contrast, knockout of TRIF
did not affect assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers following
ICH. Additionally, mutant MyD88 Arg196 abolished
the heterodimer. These results suggested that
MyD88 may play important role in ICH-induced
inflammatory injury by the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer.
In summary, Hb-induced assembly of TLR2/TLR4
heterodimers appears to represent an upstream cellular
event for ICH-induced inflammatory injury. Interfering
with the assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers may be
a novel target for developing effective treatment of ICH.
