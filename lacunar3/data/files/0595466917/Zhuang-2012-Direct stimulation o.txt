Abstract
Background: Small molecules have been shown to modulate the neurogenesis processes. In search for new therapeutic
drugs, the herbs used in traditional medicines for neurogenesis are promising candidates.
Methodology and Principal Findings: We selected a total of 45 natural compounds from Traditional Chinese herbal
medicines which are extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, and tested their proliferation-inducing activities on
neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). The screening results showed that salvianolic acid B (Sal B) displayed marked effects
on the induction of proliferation of NSPCs. We further demonstrated that Sal B promoted NSPCs proliferation in dose- and
time-dependent manners. To explore the molecular mechanism, PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and Notch signaling pathways were
investigated. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that Ly294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor), but neither U0126 (ERK inhibitor) nor
DAPT (Notch inhibitor) inhibited the Sal B-induced proliferation of cells. Western Blotting results showed that stimulation of
NSPCs with Sal B enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, and Ly294002 abolished this effect, confirming the role of Akt in Sal
B mediated proliferation of NSPCs. Rats exposed to transient cerebral ischemia were treated for 4 weeks with Sal B from the
7th day after stroke. BrdU incorporation assay results showed that exposure Sal B could maintain the proliferation of NSPCs
after cerebral ischemia. Morris water maze test showed that delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive
impairment after stroke in rats.
Significance: Sal B could maintain the NSPCs self-renew and promote proliferation, which was mediated by PI3K/Akt signal
pathway. And delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. These
findings suggested that Sal B may act as a potential drug in treatment of brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction
Ischemic brain damage is one of the most dangerous ailments
that lead to learning and memory disability, physical dysfunction
and even death. Up to now, no effective treatment has been
reported [1]. Neurons as terminally differentiated cells cannot
regenerate after injury in traditional view. However, appropriate
exercise training can facilitate some neurological function recovery
after stroke in clinical practice [2,3], with the evidence that
neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain. Neural stem/precursor
cells (NSPCs) had been found and confirmed in adult brain in past
decades that it can differentiate into neurons or glial cells as a
result of neurogenesis [4–7], NSPCs can be stimulated in several
pathological conditions, such as neurological diseases, cerebral
ischemic in adult brain, and many reports showed that they are an
excellent candidate for developing therapeutic strategies to repair
the injured CNS [8,9]. Although the NSPCs would be stimulated
to proliferation and differentiation during the brain injury, often
this response is not sufficient to overcome the damage. It is
essential to study the signalling mechanisms that are activated by
small molecular materials in the NSPCs to enhance their response
pharmacologically. NSPCs proliferation and neurogensis involves
a series of intracellular signaling pathways [10,11]. Among these
pathways, the activation of Notch, mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathways are known to play major roles in cell growth and survival
responses [12–14]. Numerous studies have shown that small
molecular materials such as growth factors [15], retinoic acid [16]
and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) active constituent
[17,18] can regulate the biological characteristics of neural stem
cell and promote neurogenesis. Therefore, regulation of neurogenesis
by NSPCs is anticipated as a noble therapeutic strategy for
brain damage.
Herbs have been used for treating diseases for centuries, and a
lot of natural compounds that with neural beneficial from
medicinal plants had been discovered [19]. Treatment of stroke

by TCM has a wealth of clinical experience and theoretical basis,
and a large number of effective clinical prescriptions have been
accumulated. In recent years a large number of studies have
shown that TCM prescription and its active ingredient can
improve cerebral ischemic injury in experimental animal [20,21].
Ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1, for example, improved spatial learning
and increase hippocampal synaptophysin level in mice [22].
Curcumin had been demonstrated to stimulate developmental and
adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and a biological activity that may
enhance neural plasticity and repair [23]. A recent report has
shown that NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional
Chinese Medicine is used in China for patients after stroke,
reduced the increase in escape latency and in swim distance
induced by ischemia [24]. With an extensive clinical experience,
there are ample opportunities to discover natural compounds that
effectively promote the proliferation of NSPCs and neurogenesis
from TCM.
Sal B was discovered in an in vitro screening assay for searching
the NSPCs proliferation-inducing natural molecules. It is one of
the major ingredients in the water-soluble extracts of S. miltiorrhiza
Bunge which has been reported to reduce cerebrovascular disease
[25–27]. As a well-known Chinese herbal medicine, Danshen
(Salvia miltiorrhiza) has been widely used in traditional Chinese
medicinal preparation for the treatment of ischemic disease, and
the medicinal properties of this plant have been extensively studied
[28,29]. Several studies have demonstrated the effect of salvianolic
acids on preventing brain injury [27,30]. Importantly, Sal B was
reported to be capable of improving the recovery of motor
function after cerebral ischemia in rats [31,32]. However, research
on the mechanism of Sal B in treatment of stroke, and the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the reported beneficial
cerebrovascular effects of Sal B are fairly rare. Meanwhile, the
effect of delayed treatment with Sal B after ischemic stroke is still
unclear. Therefore, the effect of chronic Sal B treatment beginning
seven days after ischemic stroke on neurological deficits and
pathophysiology after the transient cerebral ischemic model in rats
were studied in our research.
Considering the significance of neurogenesis-related brain
recovery, the present study was undertaken to examine the
promotive effects of Sal B on NSPCs proliferation and
neurogenesis. We provide evidence that Sal B increasing the
proliferation of NSPCs in vitro and in vivo. These actions are at
least in part mediated by altering the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway. Additionally, delayed post-ischemic administration of
Sal B had beneficial effects on the recovery of cognitive function.
The stimulative effects of Sal B on NSPCs self-renew and
neurogenesis might be associated with a favorable outcome for
stroke and other neurological disease.
Results
Salvianolic acid B induced the proliferation of cultured
NSPCs in vitro
Forty-five herbal compounds, which are extensively used
clinically for treating stroke in China, were screened in an in vitro
proliferation assay to identify compounds that could induce
proliferation of NSPCs. As shown in Fig. 1, among these natural
compounds screened, berberine and Sal B displayed marked
activity promoting NSPCs proliferation. In the following study, the
proliferative effect of berberine and Sal B were systematically
investigated but the action of berberine was proved to be an

natural compounds, which were from medicinal materials extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, were tested using a MTS assay, and the

illusion by BrdU incorporation assay (See Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information).
To study the proliferation-inducing effect of Sal B in detail, we
investigated effects of Sal B on the viability of NSPCs in vitro using
the MTS assay, NSPCs were treated with Sal B at different
concentrations and for different durations. We investigated Sal B
at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mM dose exposure for 24 hours, and at
20 mM dose incubated for 24, 48, 72 hours on promoting NSPCs
proliferation. The results showed that the viability of NSPCs
significantly increased as the dose (P,0.01, F
(6, 35)
= 103.06) and
time increases (P,0.01, Fig. 2A–B). The number and size of
neurospheres were increased by addition of 20 mM of Sal B
(Figure 2C–D). These results suggested that Sal B significantly
increased the viability of NSPCs in dose- and time- dependent
manners.
The MTS assay is a good indicator of cell viability. However, it
does not give explicit information on cell proliferation. To provide
further evidence that Sal B promotes NSPCs proliferation, a
BrdU-incorporation assay was performed. BrdU incorporated cells
were detected by immunocytochemistry with anti-BrdU antibody.
As shown in Fig. 3, Sal B significantly increased BrdU-labeled cells
compared with untreated control (P,0.01, F
(3, 40)
= 6.63, Fig. 3).
Effect of Salvianolic acid B on self-renew genes of NSPCs
To confirm the effects of Sal B on maintaining the self-renew
cell fate of NSPCs, we further investigated whether treatment of
the NSPCs with Sal B could influence their self-renew potential.
We studied the effect of Sal B on cell fate specification using RTPCR
method. NSPCs were treated with Sal B (5, 10, 20 mM) for 3
days in proliferation condition, and then the total RNA was
extracted. The effect of Sal B on mRNA expression of the selfrenew
genes, Nestin and Notch-1, was evaluated. The results
showed that Sal B up-regulated the expression of Nestin (P,0.01,
F
(5, 24)
= 6.92) and Notch-1 (P,0.01, F
(5, 24)
= 6.10) mRNA of
NSPCs (Fig. 4). These observations suggested that Sal B can
maintain self-renewal of NSPCs.
NSPCs proliferation mediated by Akt activation
To investigate the molecular mechanism of Sal B on promoting
proliferation of NSPCs, we checked the PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK
and Notch signaling pathways, which were closely related to the
proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs [12–14]. The Akt
pathway inhibitor Ly294002, ERK pathway inhibitor U0126, and
Notch pathway inhibitor DAPT were used. NSPCs were
maintained in the presence or absence of Sal B (20 mg/mL),
Ly294002 (20 mM), U0126 (10 mM) and DAPT (10 mM) for 2
days. The proliferative response of Sal B/inhibitors was studied
using the cell proliferation assay.
MTS results showed that Sal B (20 mg/mL) increased the cell
survival (Control 0.1760.01 vs Sal 0.3060.01, n = 5, P,0.01).
Inhibition of Akt activity by Ly294002 significantly reduced the
number of NSPCs, the effects of Sal B on promoting NSPCs
proliferation were abolished by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002,
Notch and ERK1/2 had no significant effect on the Sal B -
mediated cell survival (P,0.01, F(7, 40) = 158.48, Fig. 5). These
results suggested that PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in Sal B-
induced proliferation of NSPCs.
We further investigated the phosphorylation of Akt in Sal B-
treated cultures. NSPCs were stimulated with Sal B (20 mM) for
15, 30, 60, 120 min and the phosphorylation of Akt was detected
using phospho-specific antibodies. Western blotting results showed
that Sal B could increase the level of Akt phosphorylation at all of
the time tested compared with control (Fig. 6A). The effect of
Ly294002 on the blocking of Akt phosphorylation induced by Sal
B was investigated by treated NSCPs with Ly294002 (20 mM)
and/or Sal B for 30 min. As a result, Ly294002 (PI-3K inhibitor)
abolished the phosphorylation of Akt induced by Sal B (Fig. 6B).
These results suggested that PI3K/Akt signaling was involved in
Sal B mediated proliferation of NSPCs.

Salvianolic acid B increased the number of BrdU-positive
cells in vivo
In the following study, the effect of Sal B on recovery of brain
functions after transient cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Firstly,
we investigated whether Sal B (50 mg/kg) exposure in vivo would
affect NSPCs behavior. Since BrdU is incorporated into dividing
and proliferating cells, BrdU labeling has been widely used in
many investigations concerning neurogenesis. BrdU (50 mg/kg IP)
was administered to the rats in sham, vehicle, and ischemia groups
once every 2 hours over a period of 8 hours at the 21th day after
injection to label the proliferating cells after ischemia. The next
day the rats were perfused with 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.2), then with
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The dividing cells labeled
with BrdU were visualized using BrdU immunohistochemistry.
BrdU labeled neurons were found in all groups in the dentate
gyrus of the hippocampus (Fig. 7). A few BrdU-positive cells were
observed in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus in the control,
and BrdU immunoreactivity did not significantly differ between
vehicle and sham-operated animals in 21 days. We observed a
significant 2.5-fold increase in the numbers of BrdU positive cells
in the SGZ of hippocampal dentate gyrus in Sal B treated group
(50 mg/kg) (n = 4, p,0.01), which is consistent with our in vitro
findings that Sal B enhanced NSPCs proliferation.
Salvianolic acid B protected the learning and memory
functions
Since cerebral ischemia can cause prolonged spatial memory
disturbance in rats [33], we performed Morris water-maze test to
examine the hippocampus involvement and Sal B effect on in
learning and memory. Each animal was tested twice a day for 5
consecutive days on their escape latency to the hidden platform.
Fig. 8A showed the escape latencies of the three groups of animals
during acquisition training (5 days). In all the groups, escape
latencies became shorter across training sessions (F

reflected memory for the escape platform place. Repeated
measures ANCOVA revealed no interaction between training
days and groups (F

were observed between the three groups (F
(2,30)

the position of the hidden platform very quickly, reaching it
in a shorter latency during the training. In contrast, the untreated
ischemic animals showed a severe deficiency compared to the
control. Although they were gradually trained and showed better
performance, their escape latencies were still much longer than
those of the control animals. And there are signifitient difference
between sham and model of the escape latency in the day 4 (Sham

Administration of Sal B (50 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated such
deficiencies.

had learned the escape platform position. To determine the degree
of memory, on the sixth day the animal was placed in the pool for

90 s without the escape platform and the time the animal spent to
arrive the position and in the quadrant which had the escape
platform during the training experiment was recorded. Time spent
data were shown in Fig. 8. In relation to the transfer of this task,
animals in untreated group remained for a similar total period of
time in the four quadrants. Animals from sham and Sal B (50 mg/
kg) groups spent longer in the quadrant which had contained the
escape platform during the initial place learning than in the
remaining quadrants. These results showed that Sal B could
improve the learning and memory ability of cerebral ischemic
animals.
Discussion
NSPCs proliferation is important to produce of neurogenesis.
Compounds that can promote neural stem cell proliferation are
seen to support neurogenesis. In the present study, we selected a
total of 45 natural compounds from medicinal materials which are
extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, and tested their
proliferation-inducing activities on NSPCs using a MTS assay.
The screening results showed that several natural compounds such
as berberine and Sal B displayed marked effects on the
proliferation of NSPCs. In the further research, we found that
although berberine could increase the value of MTS assay, it
reduced the BrdU incorporation. The action of berberine was
proved to be an illusion since BrdU incorporation was considered
as an important sign of cell proliferation. Additionally, morphologically
berberine could cause cell swelling and decrease the cell
number (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Therefore
berberine was cytotoxic to neural stem cell and could not promote
proliferation.
To explore whether Sal B could promote the NSPCs
proliferation, we next systemic examined the promotive effects of
Sal B on NSPCs proliferation. Cortical NSPCs were isolated at
embryonic day 13.5, the cells were plated in non-adherent
conditions, evaluation with MTS assays demonstrated that Sal B
induced NSPCs proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. On the molecular level, DNA synthesis of NSPCs in Sal
B-treated cultures was determined by BrdU incorporation assay.
Immunostaining results showed that the BrdU positive cells were
up regulated by Sal B treatment. Consistent with the MTS assay,
the BrdU incorporation studies established that metabolic activity
of cells was enhanced with the presence of Sal B when compared
with the control. These observations suggested that Sal B indeed
promoted the proliferation of the NSPCs. Next we conducted a
RT-PCR analysis with NSPCs self-renew marker, Nestin and
Notch-1. The results showed that the nestin and Notch-1 mRNA
expression was up-regulated significantly by Sal B treatment. The
results were consisted with the promotion of NSPCs proliferation
induced by Sal B. In summary, these observations suggest that Sal
B could maintain the NSPCs self-renew and promote proliferation.
Several intricate cell signaling cascades are crucial for
determining whether NSPCs proliferation or differentiation.
Notch, MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are the most
frequently ones that associated with regulation of cell growth,
survival, and differentiation [34]. We sought to determine which
signaling pathway was activated by which Sal B facilitated the
NSPCs self-renew. If these signal pathways play important
proliferation roles in NSPCs, inhibition of PI3K/Akt should
reduce Sal B-induced proliferation. MTS results showed that the
absorbance value could be increased by Sal B, and PI3K/Akt
specific inhibitor Ly294002 but not Notch specific inhibitor DAPT
and MEK/ERK specific inhibitor U0126 could block this effect.
The results suggested that PI3K/Akt signal pathway was involved
in the Sal B-induced proliferation of NSPCs.
To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which Sal B
modulates PI3K/Akt signalling and by which PI3K/Akt mediates
Sal B induced self-renew, we evaluated the role of the PI3K/Akt
pathway. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase, which can be activated
by phosphorylation and subsequently enhance cell survival by
activates multiple downstream targets [35,36]. We demonstrated
that exposure to Sal B induced the activation of Akt. If PI3K/Akt
signal pathway plays an important prolifeation role, inhibition of
PI3K/Akt should reduce Sal B-induced phosphorylation of Akt.
Consistent with our hypothesis, the results showed that Sal B-
induced activation of Akt was completely inhibited by the PI3K/
Akt-inhibitor, Ly294002. In short, these findings supported the
hypothesis that PI3K/Akt signal pathway was the signal mediator
in Sal B-stimulated NSPCs proliferation.
In order to examine the effects of Sal B on proliferation of
NSPCs in vivo, transient cerebral ischemic rats and BrdU labeling
were employed. New neurons can be generated in the hippocampal
of adult rats after transient ischemia of the forebrain [37–39].
Many researchers had reported that cerebral ischemic could
transient stimulated neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. As far
as we know, Liu et al. [40] first demonstrated increased
neurogenesis in the gerbils hippocampus after transient global
ischemia, the BrdU incorporation peaks 11 days after ischemia
and that incorporation subsides to control levels by 3 weeks after
ischemia. Similar results were described after transient global
ischemia in mice [41] and rats [42]. But most of the cells were not

fully mature during the 2- to 5-week period after ischemia and
could not form a functional link [42]. Therefore, in our view, the
behavior performance could not be better at that time. In
accordance with previous reports, the NSPCs responded to the
injury by proliferation in this study. Cerebral ischemic made the
NSPCs proliferation after 7 days (See Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information), but the proliferation ability of the rats in the vehicle
group declined quickly 28 days after cerebral ischemic. However,
Sal B (25 mg/kg) treatment significantly increased the number of
BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus 21 days after injection,
suggested that Sal B exposure could maintain the ability of the
NSPCs proliferation in vivo.
Since Sal B promote NSPCs proliferation in vitro and in vivo,we
next sought to correlate the regeneration of new neurons and
recovery of brain functions. The present study demonstrated that
delayed post-ischemic treatment (7 days after ischemic stroke) with
Sal B (25 mg/kg) improved cognitive impairment after stroke in
rats. Since NSPCs proliferation in hippocampus was important site
for spatial learning and memory [43,44], we speculated that the
enhancement of functional recovery by Sal B might be dependent
on its action on NSPCs proliferation. But more extensive
experiments were still necessary to demonstrate that Sal B could
cross over the blood–brain barrier and act on NSPCs. Further
study will be carried out to clarify this point. Although our present
study showed that Sal B promoted the adult hippocampus
neurogenesis and improved the cognitive functions in cerebral
ischemia rats, there is no direct evidence to show that Sal B could
pass through the blood-brain barrier [45], and the exact
mechanism(s) by which Sal B acts on adult neurogenesis remain
unclear. More advanced research is needed in the future to further
clarify the pathways and mechanisms of Sal B in promoting adult
neurogenesis including using appropriate tool drugs to block
certain pathways to confirm NSPCs proliferation by Sal B on
contributing to the cognitive improvement.
In conclusion, the results of this work clearly demonstrated that
Sal B was capable of promoting proliferation of NSPCs and
improving the learning and memory ability of cerebral ischemic
rats. Additionally, we confirmed that Sal B promoteed NSPCs selfrenew
and neurogensis were at least in part mediated by the
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggested that Sal B
may act as a potential drug in treatment brain injury or
neurodegenerative disease.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Salvianolic acid B (Sal B, purity.99%) was purchased from the
Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and
Biological Products (Beijing, China), When used, it was freshly
prepared in phosphate buffer solution (PBS); B27 (without retinoic
acid) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA);
Recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) was from
Millipore (Temecula, CA); Antibodies for ERK1/2, phospho-
ERK1/2, Akt, phosphor-Akt (Ser-473) were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody for b-actin was
purchased from senta; 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio
)-butadiene (U0126) and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-
4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (Ly294002) was from CalBiochem (San
Diego, CA). U0126 and Ly294002 were solubilized in dimethylsulphoxide.
Cell culture
Primary neurospheres were isolated from the cerebral cortex of
13.5-day-embryonic Wistar rats, according to the method
described by Davis et al [46]. Briefly, the cerebral cortex was
carefully isolated from adjacent tissues, and collected in cold
serum-free medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 (1:1; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The tissue was digested at 37uC for 10 min
by acctuase (Millipore, Temecula, CA), and mechanically
disrupted into single cells by filtering through a nylon mesh of
70 mm. The dissociated cells were then plated at a concentration of
26105 cells/ml in T75 culture flasks for 20 ml, and cultured in
neurosphere proliferation media consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM): F12 supplemented with 2% (v/v) B27
supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 20 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (EGF; PEPROTECH, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and
20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). After 6 days in
culture, the proliferating cells formed the neurospheres, which
were suspended in the medium. Subsequently, the neurospheres
were passaged by treatment with accutase about 5 min at 37uC
until they were gently dissociated, and then subcultured as single
cells in a new T75 culture flask at a density of 20,000 cells/ml in
the fresh culture medium. The procedure of subculture was
repeated again to achieve the purified cortical NSPCs and
proliferating neurospheres. The 3–5 passages of NSPCs were
used for the following experiments.
MTS assay
For in vitro cell proliferation assay, A Cell Titer 96 AQ
ueous
One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Charbonnie `res-les-
Bains, France) was used. NSPCs were plated at 30, 000 cells/well
in a 96-well plate in the presence and absence of Sal B (0.5, 1, 5,
10, 20 mM), U0126 (10 mg/ml), DAPT (10 mg/ml) and Ly294002
(20 mg/ml) in a 96-well plate. Cell proliferation was assessed at day
2 of cell culture. According to the manufacturer’s recommendations
, 40 ml MTS solution was then added into each of the wells.
Then cells were incubated for 2 h at 37uC in the humidified 5%
CO
2
atmosphere incubator, and results were obtained at a
wavelength of 490 nm using a microplate reader (FlexStation 3,
Molecular Devices, USA). The same volume of medium without
cells was used as blank. Results were expressed in Optical Density
(OD).
In vitro BrdU-incorporation assay
For in vitro BrdU-incorporation assay, cultured NSPCs were
incubated with or without Sal B for 24 h, the cells were labeled
with BrdU (10 mg/ml) during the last 12 h of incubation, then the
cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine coated slides for 2 h, fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and incubated in 2 N HCl at 37uC for 10 min. After
washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU
antibody (1:100, senta) at 4uC for 24 h in PBS. After washing in
PBS, they were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in
PBS containing FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody (1:200, senta). BrdU-positive cells were evaluated using a
fluorescent microscope (Leica, German). BrdU positive cells were
counted in 10 randomly selected fields from three different
chambers.
RT-PCR analysis
Cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated from treated or
untreated NSPCs with TRIzol (Roche), the first strand cDNA was
synthesized from 0.4 mg of total RNA using Reverse Transcriptase
(Takala) and Random primer as described in the manufacture’s
instructions. After synthesis, 5 ml of cDNA was used in PCR
reaction with gene-specific primers, The sequences of the PCR
primer pairs (59 to 39) that were used for each gene are as follows:

) and 59- ACATGTACCCCCATAGTGGCA-39 (reverse).
Products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by
ethidium bromide staining. The relative amount of each transcript
was normalized to the level of b-actin.
Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot
analysis. Cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer.
The protein concentrations of the lysates were determined with a
Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer
’s instructions. An equal amount of protein was fractionated
by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred
onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes. After blocking
with 5% skim milk in TBS-T, the membrane was probed with
primary antibodies (goat anti-actin 1:1000, Santa Cruz; rabbit
anti-ERK1/2 1:500, rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 1:300, rabbit
anti-Akt 1:500 or rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) 1:300, Cell
Signaling Technology) in a blocking solution of non-fat milk (5%).
Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat
1:2000, goat anti-rabbit 1:2000 (Santa Cruz) antibody in non-fat
milk blocking solution (5%) was then applied. The immunoreactivity
was visualized with ECL Western blotting detection
reagents (Millipore).
Induction of the transient global ischemia
Adult (8–10 week-old) male Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g
were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia by a method
combining those described previously [47,48]. The rats were
housed singly in temperature-controlled conditions with a 12 hr
light/dark cycle (lights on: 8:00 AM) following surgery. They had
access to food and water ad libitum. Experimental procedures
were conducted in accordance with recommendations of the
Animal Ethics Committee of Tianjin University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM-2009-034-E01). In brief, twelve hours
before the induction of ischemia, rats were anesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital, the bilateral carotid arteries were exposed
to facilitate the occluding on the following day, and then the
vertebral arteries were irreversibly occluded by electrocoagulation.
The next day, ischemia was induced by bilaterally occluding
carotid arteries with aneurysm clips, and carotid arteries were
clamped for 6 min exactly. Rats lost their righting reflex during
ischemic, the clips were removed to restore cerebral blood flow.
The rats that remain their righting reflex in 1 min after occluding
of the both carotid arteries were considered to be failure of
ischemia and eliminated. Sham-operated rats were anesthetized,
the carotid arteries were isolated, but they were not clamped.
Drug adminstration
The study was carried out on rats divided into three groups
(n = 13). (i) Sham group+vehicle (Sham), (ii) Ischemic group+-
vehicle (Model) and (iii) Ischemic group+Sal B (Sal B). Seven days
after cerebral ischemia, Sal B (50 mg/kg) was dissolved in distilled
water, and injected i.p. once daily for 4 weeks, and three mice in
each group were used for histological analysis at day 21 after
innjection. All controls received an amount of vehicle equivalent to
drug treatment conditions.
In vivo proliferation assay
For in vivo proliferation analysis of Sal B, that had not been
behaviorally tested were evaluated for BrdU labeling. BrdU
(50 mg/kg; Sigma) was injected i.p. once every 2 hours over a
period of 8 hours at the 21th day after injection to label the
proliferating cells. Twenty-four hours after the last BrdU injection,
rars were anesthetized with ether and perfused with PBS, followed
by a cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Brains were collected
and post-fixed overnight in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution at
4uC. Coronal sections (20 mm thickness) were obtained throughout
the hippocampus. For analysis concerning BrdU immunohistochemistry
, sections were incubated in 50% formamide/26saline
sodium citrate (SSC) for 2 h at 65uC, followed by a rinse with PBS.
Sections were then incubated in 2 N HCl for 30 min at 37uCto
denature double-stranded DNA, and rinsed in 0.1 M borate buffer
(pH 8.5). After blocking for 2 h with 1% BSA in PBS, sections
were incubated overnight at 4uC with mouse anti-BrdU
monoclonal antibody (1:100; senta). Followed by rinsing in PBS,
sections were incubated for 2 h at RT with biotinylated goat antimouse
IgG (1:200; senta), and incubated for 2 h at RT with the
ABC kit. BrdU positive cells were visualized by incubating sections
with Vector DAB.
Morris water maze task
The learning and memory ability was examined using the
Morris water-maze [49]. A cylindrical tank 1.5 m in diameter was
filled with water (2261uC), and a transparent platform 10 cm in
diameter was placed at a constant position in the center of one of
the four quadrants within the tank. The platform was set 2 cm
below the water level where the rats could not see it directly. Rats
were allowed to swim freely for 1 min to become habituated to the
apparatus. From the next day, in the hidden platform trials,
acquisition trials were carried out 2 times per day for 5 days. In
each trial, rats were placed into the water at a fixed starting
position, and the time taken to escape onto the hidden platform
and the swimming path length were measured. Rats were given
90 s to find the hidden platform during each acquisition trial. If it
failed to locate the platform within 90 s, it was guided there. The
rat was allowed to stay on the platform for 20 s. Performance was
tested 24 h after the final training day in a probe trial during
which the platform was removed, the rat was placed in the start
and its behavior was monitored for 90 s.
Statistical analysis
SPSS11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc.) was used to analyze the
data. Data are expressed as the mean 6 S.D. and analyzed by
ANOVA followed by the post-hoc Least Significant Difference
(LSD) test. Differences were considered statistically significant if P
values were less than 0.05. To analyze water-maze placenavigation
performance, the average escape latency of 5 trials
per day per animal was calculated and evaluated by repeatedmeasures
ANCOVA.
