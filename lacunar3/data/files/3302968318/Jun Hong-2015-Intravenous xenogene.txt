Objectives: The potential for beneficial effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) on
myocardial perfusion and left ventricular dysfunction in myocardial ischemia (MI) has
not been tested following intravenous delivery. Methods: Surviving pigs following
induction of MI were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different groups: the placebo group
(n57), the single bolus group (SB) (n57, 15 3 107 ASCs), or the divided dose group
(DD) (n57, 53 107 ASCs/day for three consecutive days). Myocardial perfusion defect
area and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were compared during the 28-day follow-up.
Also, serial changes in the absolute number of circulating CD41T and CD81T cells
were measured. Results: The increases in ejection fraction were significantly greater
in both the SB and the DD groups compared to the placebo group (5.460.9%,
3.760.7%, and 20.460.6%, respectively), and the decrease in the perfusion defect
area was significantly greater in the SB group than the placebo group (236.361.8 and
211.562.8). CFR increased to a greater degree in the SB and the DD groups than in
the placebo group (0.960.2, 0.860.1, and 0.260.2, respectively). The circulating number
of CD81T cells was significantly greater in the SB and DD groups than the placebo
group at day 7 (3,6876317/mL, 3,4546787/mL, and 1,9286457/mL, respectively). The
numbers of small vessels were significantly greater in the SB and the DD groups than

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death
in the United States in spite of rapid advances in the
treatment of coronary artery disease [1]. The concept of
using stem and progenitor cells isolated from adult tissues
to treat patients with myocardial ischemia (MI) is
gaining momentum. Several clinical trials involving
skeletal myoblasts [2,3], bone marrow-derived progenitor
cells [4–6], and peripheral blood progenitor cells
[7,8] have shown encouraging results for limiting myocardial
damage and improving myocardial function.
Therapies employing adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)
have also emerged as a practical approach to promote
recovery. ASCs are mesenchymal cells that share many
properties in common with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs), and reside in the stromalvascular
fraction of adipose tissue [9–11]. Therapeutic
use of autologous ASCs for cardiac repair is particularly
practical due to the ready availability of these cells in
large quantities for therapeutic injection. Many studies
have employed invasive techniques to deliver stem or
progenitor cells directly into a coronary artery or the
myocardium. Our recent data demonstrating that ASC
delivered intravenously had systemic activity, including
effects on bone marrow progenitors and adipose tissue
mass as well as pulmonary endothelium [12], suggested
the hypothesis that intravenous ASC delivery would
also be a particularly feasible approach to the early provision
of stem cells in acute MI, and would demonstrate
significant rescue of myocardial function and perfusion
without a need for targeted delivery. In the current
study, we observed the distribution of intravenously
injected human ASCs 2 hr, 14 days, and 28 days after
inducing MI in swine. We then investigated the efficacy
of single bolus vs. three consecutive divided intravenous
injections of human ASCs following induction of MI.
METHODS
Animal Model
Animal handling followed the recommendations of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the Indiana University School of Medicine.
Twenty-seven pathogen-free (Michigan State University
) Yorkshire cross domestic pigs (28–38 kg) of mixed
gender were employed. MI was induced by angioplasty
balloon inflation in the mid left anterior descending coronary
artery (LAD). Pigs surviving acute MI were randomly
assigned to 1 of 3 groups: placebo [n¼7, 3 mL
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)], single bolus (n¼7,
15  107 hASCs), or divided dose (n¼7, 5  107
hASCs/day for three consecutive days) (Fig. 1). To
examine hASC distribution and persistence, two pigs
were sacrificed 2 hr and 14 days after systemic injection
of 15 107 hASCs.
Aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg were given
orally 24 hr prior to anterior MI, followed by aspirin
81 mg daily. Unfractionated heparin (300 U/kg) was
administered intravenously and repeated to maintain
the ACT300 sec. General anesthesia was induced by
intramuscular telazol (4.4 mg/kg), xylazine (2.2 mg/
kg), ketamine (2.2 mg/kg), and atropine (0.05 mg/kg).
The animal was then intubated and ventilated with a
closed volume cycle respirator, and anesthesia maintained
with isoflurane (1.5–2.5%) and oxygen (2 L/
min) while maintaining euthermia. Buprenex (0.01 mg/
kg) was administered for analgesia.
Fig. 1. Study protocol. Swine were randomized into three
groups (placebo, single bolus, and divided dose). Echocardiography
, MCE, CFR, lymphocyte subpopulation analysis were
done before MI and 2 and 28 days after MI. CFR was measured
before MI, 2 hrs and 28 days after MI.

Myocardial Infarction Induction and Intracoronary
Doppler Measurements
Arterial access was obtained via the femoral artery
with a cutdown technique. Left coronary angioplasty
was performed using a 7 Fr Hockey-stick guiding catheter
(Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA). Continuous
hemodynamic monitoring was performed via an 8 Fr
femoral artery sheath. After baseline left coronary angiography
, MI was induced by inflating a Quantum
MaverickV R 3.5 mm  8 mm over-the-wire balloon
(Boston Scientific Corp.) for 60 minutes in the LAD
immediately distal to the first dominant septal perforator.
To minimize ventricular arrhythmias, intravenous
amiodarone was administered prior to balloon inflation
(75 mg/10 min) and continued at 1 mg/min for 60 min
post occlusion [13]. Breakthrough arrhythmias were
terminated with DC cardioversion when necessary
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Coronary angiography
was performed again after balloon inflation and at euthanasia.
Serum cardiac troponin-I was measured 48 hr
after MI by chemiluminescent immunoassay
(ImmuliteV R, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) validated
for a porcine model (ANTECHV R Diagnostics Inc.,
Morrisville, NC).
Coronary microvascular flow was measured by intracoronary
Doppler wire (Flowire, Volcano Corp, Rancho
Cordova, CA) at baseline and 2 hr post-MI.
Nitroglycerin 0.2 mg was injected into the intracoronary
circulation to achieve maximal epicardial coronary
artery dilation without significantly affecting
coronary microcirculation. A Doppler guidewire was
positioned in the LAD just distal to the first dominant
septal perforator. The average peak flow velocity was
measured at baseline and during maximal hyperemia
induced by intracoronary bolus injection of 30 lg
adenosine [14,15]. Doppler measurements were
repeated at least three times, and then averaged. As a
surrogate for microvascular integrity, coronary flow
reserve (CFR) was determined as the adenosineinduced
average peak flow velocity divided by the
baseline average peak flow velocity; this was repeated
28 days later with an identically positioned Doppler
wire, as confirmed by two orthogonal views.
Isolation and Culture of Human Adipose Stromal
Cells
Human subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue samples
were obtained from two female volunteers (age 23
and 38) undergoing liposuction. ASCs isolated from
each volunteer were evenly distributed between the single
bolus and divided dose groups. Adipose tissue was
agitated in 1 mg/mL Collagenase type I (Worthington
Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) prepared in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 medium (Invitrogen
, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100
lg/mL streptomycin, for 2 hr at 37

C followed by centrifugation
at 300g for 8 min to separate the stromal
cell fraction (pellet) from adipocytes [16]. The pellet
was resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS filtered through 250 lm Nitex (Sefar
America Inc., Kansas City, MO) and centrifuged at
300g for 8 min. To eliminate erythrocytes the pellet
was treated with RBC lysis buffer (154 mM NH
4
Cl,
10 mM KHCO
3
, 0.1 mM EDTA) for 10 min. The final
pellet was resuspended and cultured in EGM-2MV
media (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). ASC monolayers
were passaged when 60–80% confluent and used
at passage 3–4. Cell viability was evaluated by Trypan
blue staining. For single bolus 15  107 hASCs injection
, cells were resuspended in 9 mL of PBS with
100U/mL unfractionated heparin and autologous swine
serum (450 mL) immediately before delivery, and
injected 2 hr post-MI. For the divided dose 5  107
hASCs group, cells were resuspended in 3 mL of PBS
with 100U/mL unfractionated heparin and autologous
swine serum (150 mL) immediately before delivery;
ASCs were injected 2, 24, and 48 hr after MI. The suspension
was infused at 2 mL/min via ear vein catheter.
Contrast-Enhanced Echocardiography and
Myocardial Perfusion Echocardiography
Contrast-enhanced 2D and 3D echocardiography and
myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) were performed
prior to MI, 2 days after MI, and prior to sacrifice
at day 28. Pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane
and imaged in right lateral decubitus position using a
phased-array (S5-1, 1–5 MHz) and matrix-array (X3-1,
1–3 MHz) transducer connected to an iE33 system
(Philips Medical System, Andover, MA). Microbubbles
were prepared by sonication of a gas-saturated aqueous
suspension of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (2 mg/mL)
and polyoxyethylene-40-stearate (1 mg/mL) [17], and
were intravenously infused during 3D image acquisition
using harmonic imaging to optimize left ventricular
(LV) endocardial border delineation (Supporting
Information Fig. 1A and B). The endocardial border at
end-systole and end-diastole was manually traced in
the four chamber apical view from 3D images, and LV
end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume
, and ejection fraction (EF) were obtained (Supporting
Information Fig. 1C–E). Wall thickening and
fractional shortening were measured from 2D-guided
M-mode recordings (Supporting Information Fig. 2A–
D). For additional quantification of wall motion, the
16-segment model was used, adding segmental wall

motion scores of 1¼normal, 2¼hypokinesis,
3¼akinesis, and 4¼dyskinesis (Supporting Information
Fig. 2E) [18,19]. Wall motion score index
(WMSI) was calculated as the sum of the scores of the
segments divided by the number of the segments evaluated.
Data were analyzed by two readers who were
blinded to the randomization using QLab software
(Version 7.0, Philips Medical System, Andover, MA).
Interobserver correlation was 0.82 (P<0.001), and
intraobserver correlation on 15 randomly selected cases
were 0.89 and 0.84 (P<0.001 for both) for the two
readers.
To assess myocardial perfusion, a microbubble suspension
(5  107 mL1) was infused intravenously at
1.5 mL min1 to produce myocardial opacification with
minimal inferior wall attenuation. MCE was performed
in the parasternal short-axis plane just below papillary
muscle level using power modulation at a mechanical
index of 0.16. End-systolic images were acquired after a
5-frame high-power (mechanical index 1.2) sequence.
The percent area of microbubble perfusion was measured
with ImageJ software (1.43u, National Institute of
Health, USA). The area at risk (AAR) during LAD coronary
occlusion and the region void of perfusion at 2
and 28 days after MI were each measured by two
blinded readers, averaged, and expressed as percentages
of the total LV area. Interobserver correlation for AAR
measurements was 0.81 (P<0.001) and intraobserver
correlation for 15 randomly selected cases was 0.86 and
0.82 (P<0.001 for both).
Analysis of Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and
Granulocyte Populations in Peripheral Blood
Blood samples were obtained and collected into test
tubes containing heparin pre-MI, and day 2, 7, and 28
post-MI. Within 1 hr of collection, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated by density
gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque plusV R
(Amersham Biosciences Corp., NJ). The number of
lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils in PBMNCs
were measured using Coulter LHV R755 automated hematology
analyzers (Beckman Coulter Inc., CA).
Erythrocytes were lysed by incubating in 10 mL of red
blood cell lysis buffer solution (154 mM NH
4
Cl,
10 mM KHCO
3
, 0.1 mM EDTA). Lymphocyte subsets
analyzed were helper T cells (CD3þCD4þ) or cytotoxic
T cells (CD3þCD8þ). Cells were stained with
fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against
CD8-PE (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), CD3-FITC (BD),
and CD4-PE (BD) for 20 min at 4

C. Pelleted leukocytes
were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed
by flow cytometry (BD). Expression levels were analyzed
using CellQuestTM Pro software (BD).
DNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Assays for Alu
Sequences
Heart, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, and bone
marrow were isolated and stored at 80

C. Samples
(25 mg) were thawed and homogenized with a
BeadBeater-8 (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK). A DNA
extraction kit was used for DNA isolation (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA). Standard curves were generated for
PCR by addition of known numbers of hASCs (0–105)
into pig tissue samples prior to homogenization. Realtime
PCR assays for Alu sequences [20] were performed
in a reaction volume of 50 lL that contained
25 lL Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 900 nM each of the forward
(50-CAT GGT GAA ACC CCG TCT CTA-30)
and reverse primers (50-GCC TCA GCC TCC CGA
GTA G-30), 250 nM TaqMan probe (50-FAM-ATT
AGC CGG GCG TGG TGG CG-TAMRA-30), and 200
ng target template. Reactions were incubated at 50

C
for 2 min and 95

C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
at 95

C for 15 sec and 60

C for 1 min. Cycledependent
amplification for each tissue sample was
used to estimate the number of hASCs. All real-time
PCR assays were performed in duplicate and average
values presented.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean6SEM.
Variables measured repeatedly were compared using
repeated-measures ANOVA. Kruskal–Wallis test or
one-way ANOVA with Tamhane post hoc analysis was
used for multiple comparisons. Mann–Whitney U test
was used to compare two groups, and Spearman’s correlation
was calculated with SPSSV R 12.0 software
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Study Animals
No significant difference in body weights were
noted among the three groups at baseline (Table I).
Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurred during
each LAD occlusion. Intractable ventricular fibrillation
with unsuccessful cardioversion occurred in four pigs,
and another two pigs died suddenly within 48 hr after
MI (22% cumulative attrition rate). Cardiac troponin-I
levels were increased in all pigs 48 hr after MI
without significant differences among three groups
(Table I).

Changes in Left Ventricular Function
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) showed no
significant difference among three groups before and 2
days after MI. However, LVEF was significantly
greater in the single bolus group compared to the placebo
group 28 days after MI (Table I). The changes in
LVEF between 2 and 28 days after MI showed significant
increases in both the single bolus and the divided
dose groups compared to the placebo group (Table I).
While no significant differences were noted in inferior
wall thickening during the 28 day follow-up, anterior
wall thickening (%) was significantly greater in the
single bolus group compared to the placebo group (Table
I; Supporting Information Fig. 2B and C). After
normalizing anterior wall thickening (%) with inferior
wall thickening (%), anterior and inferior wall thickening
ratio at day 28 was greater in the single bolus
group compared to the placebo group (Table I). WMSI
was similar among three groups at day 2, but WMSI
was significantly lower in the single bolus (P¼0.002)
and the divided dose groups (P¼0.002) than the placebo
group at day 28 (Supporting Information Fig. 2F).
Myocardial Microvascular Perfusion and
Coronary Flow
The mean AAR, illustrated in Supporting Information
Fig. 3A, was 29.762.3% in the single bolus
group and was not different between groups, and the
mean perfusion defect area in the single bolus group
decreased from 25.061.7% at day 2 to 14.361.3% at
day 28 (Supporting Information Fig. 3B). The perfusion
defect area (%) at day 28 revealed a strong correlation
to the non-viable myocardial area (%) in TTC
staining (r¼0.81, P<0.001) (Supporting Information
Fig. 3C and D). When the change in perfusion defect
area from day 2 to day 28 was normalized with the
AAR, the decrease (improvement) in the perfusion
defect area was significantly greater in the single bolus
group compared to the placebo group (36.361.8 and
11.562.8, P¼0.021, respectively) (Fig. 2).
CFR decreased considerably in all three groups 2
hr after MI, while the values of CFR at day 28 were
significantly greater in the single bolus and the divided
dose groups compared to the placebo group
(2.360.1, 2.160.1, and 1.660.1, respectively) (Fig.
3. AA). When the changes in CFR from 2 hr post-MI
to day 28 were compared, the increases in the CFR
were significantly greater in the single bolus and the
divided dose groups than the placebo group
(0.960.2, 0.860.1, and 0.260.2, respectively) (Fig.
3. AA). Moreover, the decreases in the perfusion
defect area (%) during the 28-day interval correlated
with the increases in CFR (r¼0.71, P¼0.001)
(Fig. 3. AB).
Immune Modulation
No significant differences in total neutrophil, monocyte
, or lymphocyte numbers were observed among
groups before or after MI (Supporting Information Fig.
4A–D). However, analysis of subpopulations revealed
that absolute numbers of CD8þT cells dropped

(1,9286457/mL in the placebo group, 3,6876317/mL
in the single bolus group, and 3,4546787/mL in the divided
dose group) (Supporting Information Fig. 4E and
F), contributing to a significant increase in the CD4þ/
CD8þ T cell ratio seen in the placebo group but suppressed
in the single bolus and divided dose groups
(175617, 8865, and 98616, respectively) (Fig. 4).
Electrical Ventricular Stability After MI
Most premature ventricular contraction (PVC)s
occurred within 10 hr post-MI (Fig. 5), and administration
of ASC resulted in significant suppression of
PVCs per total beats (%) in the divided dose group
when compared with the placebo group at 5 hr
(3.860.4% and 5.360.2% respectively), 6 hr
(2.760.3% and 5.060.4%, respectively), and 7 hr
post-MI (2.260.2% and 4.160.1% respectively) (Fig.
5). Also, significant decrease in PVCs (%) was noted
in the single bolus group vs. the placebo group 7 hr
post-MI (2.760.4% and 4.160.1%, respectively)
(Fig. 5).
Comparison of Angiogenesis and Nerve
Sprouting
Significant increases in the number of smooth
muscle actin (SMA)þ small vessels were found in
the single bolus group when compared to the placebo
group in non-infarct (4963/mm2 and 3865/
mm2, respectively), peri-infarct (4065/mm2 and
2563/mm2, respectively), and infarct areas (2864/
mm2 and 1562/mm2, respectively) (Fig. 6A and B)
(Supporting Information Fig. 5A–C). Also, significant
increases in the number of SMAþ small vessels
were noted in the divided dose group when compared
to the placebo group in both peri-infarct
(4264/mm2 and 2563/mm2, respectively) and
infarct areas (2762/mm2 and 1562/mm2, respectively
) (Fig. 6A). No significant difference in the
number of SMAþ large vessels was found among
the groups (Fig. 6B).
Remarkable increases in GAP43þ nerve density
were found in the single bolus group (P¼0.031)
and the divided dose group (P¼0.005) when compared
to placebo in the peri-infarct areas (Fig. 6C;
Supporting Information Fig. 5D–F). No significant
difference in the GAP43þ nerve density was found
among three groups in the non-infarct areas. The
most active angiogenesis and nerve sprouting in the
single bolus and the divided dose group occurred in
the basal, mid-anteroseptal, and anterolateral segments
, corresponding to regions where perfusion by
MCE increased from day 2 to day 28. Serial sections
demonstrated that GAP43þ nerve sprouting
were found most prominently around SMAþ small
vessels in the peri-infarct areas (Supporting Information
Fig. 5G–I).
Fig. 3. A. CFR revealed significant increases in the single
bolus and the divided dose groups than the placebo group (*P
< 0.01 and **P < 0.05). B: The decreases in the perfusion
defect area (%) during the follow-up correlated with the
increases in CFR.

Tissue Distribution of hASCs After Systemic
Injection
Real-time PCR for human DNA Alu elements was
examined in multiple tissues 2 hr, 14, and 28 days after
15  107 hASC injection. Heart was sectioned into five
short-axis slices each with 4 or 6 segments (Supporting
Information Fig. 2E), and samples from heart, lung,
liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and bone marrow were
examined for hASC presence. Two hours after intravenous
injection, most (85.7%) hASCs were detected in
the lungs (Fig. 7A), where ASC numbers decreased significantly
14 days after cell injection. A few hASCs
were detected in the peri-infarct area 2 hr after systemic
injection of 15  107 cells (Fig. 7B), but no hASC
were found at day 28 (Fig. 7C). hASCs were also readily
visualized in lung 2 hr after systemic injection but
not at day 28 (Fig. 7D and E).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to evaluate the time course of
LV contractile function and microvascular integrity after
intravenous delivery of human ASCs in a swine MI
model. We have demonstrated the feasibility of xenogeneic
transplantation of ASCs in the absence of specific
immunosuppression, and shown for the first time that intravenous
ASC injection either as a single bolus or divided
dose (over three consecutive days) improves
LVEF and CFR, and significantly reduces the extent of
myocardial infarction at a 28-day follow-up. We propose
that modulation in inflammation manifested by the
CD4þ/CD8þT cell ratio, as well as the increase in local
angiogenesis and myocardial nerve sprouting after MI
contribute to limitation in infarction, with improvement
in myocardial and microvascular function. Although
most intravenously injected ASCs were trapped in the
lung and disappeared within 14 days after cell injection,
the beneficial effects persisted at day 28. We hypothesize
that intravenous injection of ASCs could be utilized
as a potential therapeutic option in patients with MI.
Although many pre-clinical and clinical trials have
explored intracoronary, endocardial, or epicardial
routes for delivery of stem cells after ischemic myocardial
damage [2–7,21,22], these methods of delivery are
more invasive than intravenous delivery of stem cells.
However, many studies demonstrating functional benefits
of invasive cell delivery do not have welldocumented
data regarding the fate of those delivered
cells [2–7,23]. In our previous study, we delivered
PBMNCs via intracoronary, epicardial, and retrograde
coronary venous routes, and noted that even with these
local delivery routes, most delivered PBMNCs were
found in the lung within 1 hr after cell delivery [13];
this prompted us to hypothesize that cells distributed to
the lung might in fact contribute significantly to the
beneficial effects observed in numerous studies. Our
recent study of intravenous ASC delivery in a mouse
model of COPD clearly demonstrated effects of the
cells on multiple tissues, including lung, bone marrow,
and fat [12]. This effect has also been suggested to
explain cardiac effects of bone-marrow derived MSCs,
which were shown to secrete factors such as TSG-6
while entrapped in lung tissue following systemic
delivery [20], and more recently also were shown to
modulate lung pathology via TSG-6 secretion [24].
Paracrine effects by delivered cells probably played an
important role in inhibiting further myocardial damage
or progression of cardiac remodeling in the early period
after ischemic myocardial damage in these cardiac
studies [2–7,23]. The outcomes of this study support
the notion that ASCs which lodge in the pulmonary
circulation secrete paracrine factors that are delivered
directly to the LV on their first-pass, where they produce
cardioprotective effects. In our pilot experiment
with rat myocardial infarction model, injecting cellfree
supernatant from the cultured hASC monolayers
containing factors such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming
growth factor (TGF)-beta, and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) did not improve LV function as
prominent as giving hASCs intravenously (Supporting
Information Fig. 6). We assume that even though intravenously
injected hASCs disappear within 2 weeks
from pulmonary vessels, injected hASCs continuously
secrete angiogenic and anti-apoptotic factors into circulation
in the early period after MI, thereby demonstrating
significant improvement in LV function after
myocardial damage in this study.
LV remodeling, which includes infarct expansion
and LV dilatation, starts very early after MI [25–28],
and is an indication of poor prognosis and occurs despite
coronary revascularization [26]. While enddiastolic
and end-systolic volumes increased post-MI in
the placebo group, these adverse changes were remarkably
ameliorated in the single bolus group during the
28-day follow-up after MI, with more prominent
decreases in the end-systolic volume, indicating beneficial
effects of early intravenous ASC injection on both
systolic function and LV remodeling in this study
(Supporting Information Fig. 1C and D). Significant
functional improvement in stroke volume was observed
in the single bolus group when compared to the placebo
group at day 28, indicating beneficial effects of
early intravenous ASC injection in LV contractile function
(Supporting Information Fig. 1E).
MCE is a useful technique for evaluating myocardial
microvascular perfusion during acute coronary occlusion
, as well as eventual infarct size. We demonstrated
a significant reduction in the post-MI perfusion defect
in animals receiving single bolus ASCs (Fig. 2,

Supporting Information Fig. 3B). This study also
showed the expected correlation between the perfusion
defect area (%) and the nonviable myocardial area in
TTC staining (%) (r¼0.81, P<0.001), suggesting that
improvement in vascularization in border zones
resulted in smaller infarct size. Moreover, the decreases
in the perfusion defect area (%) during the follow-up
correlated with the increases in CFR (r¼0.71,
P¼0.001) which indicate that the decreases in perfusion
defect area indeed represent improvement in myocardial
microvascular flow. Nerve sprouting and
angiogenesis contribute to the improvement in LV contractile
function and microvascular flow, and significant
increases in the nerve density and the number of
a-actinþ small vessels colocalized at the border where
perfusion by MCE increased during the follow-up in
the ASC injected groups (Supporting Information Fig.
5). This suggests that real-time MCE could be used as
a valuable noninvasive tool to evaluate angiogenesis
induced by ASC delivery in clinical practice.
T cells play an important role in regulating the early
inflammatory responses to MI/reperfusion injury [29].
MI is associated with an accumulation of lymphocytes
such as CD4þT and CD8þT cells in damaged myocardium
[29], and inhibition of T cells by cyclosporine A
and tacrolimus has been demonstrated to protect the
heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury [30,31]. ASCs
are known for immunomodulating effects [9], and it is
interesting to note that the transplantation of ASCs in
this study prevented sequestration of circulating
CD8þT cells 7 days after MI, thereby preventing the
post-MI increase in CD4/CD8 ratio in both the single
bolus and the divided dose groups (Fig. 4, Supporting
Information Fig. 4E and F). This alteration in the balance
of the T cell ratio may have contributed to the limitation
of myocardial injury by ASC.
There are a few limitations in this study. We injected
xenogeneic ASCs to allow specific evaluation of the
effect of human ASCs in this large animal model of infarction.
While we correctly anticipated that xenogeneic
ASC transplant would be tolerable given the immunomodulatory
effects of this cell type, we recognize the
remaining uncertainty whether allogeneic or autologous
ASCs might provide greater functional rescue than xenogeneic
ASCs. We used 15  107 hASCs based on
pilot dose escalation studies involving direct coronary
artery infusion, and it is unknown whether systemic
injection of higher number of ASCs could provide
superior improvement in damaged myocardium. Moreover
, the follow-up duration was 28 days in this study,
and a long-term follow-up could be conducted to
confirm a sustained benefit from ASC therapy. We
could not use fresh, uncultured cells in this study
because not enough hASC could be obtained for
intravenous injections in swine myocardial infarction
model, and proliferative and differentiation abilities of
stem cells gradually decrease at their later passages.
CONCLUSIONS
Data from phase I clinical trials such as the
APOLLO [32] and the PRECISE trials [33] have been
presented recently. The APOLLO trial in 14 patients
with ST-elevation MI showed a reduction in infarct
size after intracoronary injection of autologous ASCs
[32]. The PRECISE trial in 27 patients with nonrevascularizable
ischemic myocardium showed a reduction
in infarct size after direct injection of autologous
ASCs [33]. These two clinical trials used invasive
intracoronary and intramyocardial delivery methods.
Our preclinical study suggests that noninvasive intravenous
delivery of ASCs may also prove effective and
feasible in ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion induced
myocardial damage, and represents an attractive noninvasive
approach that will expand the potential clinical
application of ASC therapy for myocardial tissue rescue
in patients with acute MI.
