Cerebral ischemia
Cerebral ischemic stroke is a prevalent disease in senior individuals. The anticoagulation and thrombolysis to
recover blood supply as well as the diminution of neural excitotoxicity to protect brain cells have not shown
to fully improve stroke patients. The comprehensive mechanisms and medication specificity remain to be
addressed. The silence of specific mRNAs by RNA interference provides revenues for such goals. We examined
whether the silence of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by siRNA protects brain tissues from ischemic
injury. In three groups of Wistar rats, their lateral ventricles received the injections of lentiviral vectors carrying
siRNA for PAR1, small RNA in mismatching PAR1 or saline. A week after the injections, these rats were
treated by one side of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The scores of neurological deficits, the volume
of ischemic infarction and the expressions of PAR-1, HSP-70 and MAP-2 were measured in 24 h of MCAO. Our
results show that the silence of PAR-1 significantly reduces neurological deficits and infarction volume, as well
as elevates HSP-70 and MAP-2 expressions. Thus, the knock-down of PAR1 minimizes the ischemic impairments
of cerebral cortex via HSP70 and MAP-2 pathways.

1. Introduction
The therapies of ischemic stroke, i.e., anticoagulation, thrombolysis
and neuronal protection have not shown substantially to improve
stroke patients[1–5]. Specific molecular targets for its medication remain
to be developed. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) activated
by thrombin plays a central role in coagulation cascade [6–8], and is
widely distributed on the surfaces of brain cells[9–12]. Recent studies
demonstrate that the PAR-1 protein is up-regulated during ischemia
in hippocampus[9,13,14], and PAR-1 antagonist may protect cerebral
tissues from ischemic injury and infarction [13,15,16]. Thus, PAR-1 is
likely a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
RNA interference through micro-RNA is an evolutionarily conserved
process of gene silence during post-transcription[17–23].Adeliveryof
small interference RNA (siRNA) built by chemical and biological ways
into cells has been believed to specifically knock-down the designed
genes [24–28]. We intend to examine whether the silence of PAR-1 by
siRNA prevents the ischemic impairment of brain tissues. After identifying
the effectiveness of siRNA on silencing PAR-1 genes, we examined
the score of neurological deficits and the volume of ischemic impairment
, as well as the expressions of heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70)
and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), two proteins in the
protection of brain cells against ischemic stroke [29–31], to merit the
outcome of PAR-1 knock-down to ischemia.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and surgery
The entire procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (ACUC) in Harbin Heilongjiang, China. Eighty-four
healthy male Wistar rats (220–280 g), from the Institute of Laboratory
Animal in Chinese Academy of Medical Science, were randomly divided
into three groups, twenty-eight in each group. Lentivirus-carried
(LV) siRNA-PAR1 (experimental group), LV-misRNA‐PAR1 (negative
control) and 0.9% NaCl (naïve control) were injected into the rats'
lateral ventricle in these three groups, respectively. The amount of
LV particles was the multiplication of 108/μl and 10μl. Seven days
after the injection, the rats were treated with middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO).
The surgical operations for the MCAO were performed based on the
technique described by Zea-Longa [32,33]. The rats were anesthetized
by the intraperitoneal injection of 4% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg).
During MCAO operations, a long nylon suture was inserted into the left

internal carotid artery for 2 h. To completely block bloodflow into MCA,
an intraluminal suture was introduced via the extracranial ICA. The detailed
procedures are given below.
The left side of CCA was exposed by midline incision under an operating
microscope. A retractor was positioned between the digastric
and sternomastoid muscles, and the omohyoid muscle was divided.
An ICA was isolated fully from an adjacent vagus nerve. Further dissection
exposed glossopharyngeal nerve at the origin of pterygopalatine
artery. The extracranial branch of the ICA was ligated with 7–0 nylon
suture close to its origin. At this point, the ICA is the only remaining
extracranial branch of the CCA. Subsequently, a 6–0 silk suture was
tied loosely around the mobilized ECA stump, and a curved microvascular
clip was placed across both the CCA and ICA adjacent to the ECA
origin. A 5 cm length of 4–0 monofilament nylon suture, whose tip
were smoothed by flame heating, was inserted into the ECA lumen
via a puncture on one of terminal branches of the ECA. The silk suture
around the ECA stump was tightened around the intraluminal nylon
suture to prevent bleeding, and microvascular clip was removed. The
nylon suture was then gently advanced from the ECA to the ICA
lumen; the position of the suture within the ICA lumen could be
seen when it reached the base of the skull. After this nylon suture
had been inserted into the ECA stump, resistance was felt and a slight
curving of the suture or stretching of the ICA was observed, indicating
that the blunted tip of the suture had passed into the MCA origin and
reached the proximal segment of anterior cerebral artery (ACA),
which has a smaller diameter. At this point, the intraluminal suture
has blocked the origin of the MCA, and occluded all sources of blood
flow from the ICA, ACA and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The incision
was closed, leaving 1 cm of the nylon suture out such that it
could be withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The restoration of MCA
bloodflow can be done by pulling the suture back until the resistance
was felt, indicating that the tip had cleared the ACA-ICA lumen and
was in the ECA stump, and then trimmed.
The rats in three groups were randomly selected into two groups
that were decapitated at 24 or 72 h after MCAO, and their brain tissues
were harvested to examine the injury of ischemia and the expressions
of mRNA and proteins. It is noteworthy that all of the rats were evaluated
and scored by neurological deficits (see below) immediately before
decapitation.
2.2. The design of siRNA design and the construction of lentiviral vectors
Based on the sequence of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)
mRNA, we designed the hairpin format of small interference RNAs
(siRNA) by using the guidelines in the publications [32–36] and a
public software Ambion (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) [37,38]. In 
the design, multiple interference sites of PAR-1 mRNA were made to
search an optimal sequence of siRNA for PAR-1 knock-down. After
the experimental evaluation and computational modeling of cultured
cells, we selected an optimal sequence of siRNA for PAR-1 knockdown
(called as siRNA‐PAR1), which was“GTCTGCTACACGTCCATCA”.
In the synthesis of DNA oligo that contains siRNA sequence, the limited
endogenous-enzyme sites were added into both sides of oligo. After
cutting by the enzymes, this interference sequence was inserted into
the backbone plasmid of lentivirus. This plasmid then was amplified,
cloned and identified in bacterial sensory cells. The positive clones including
siRNA-PAR1 were collected. The selected plasmids were purified and concentrated. The condensed plasmids with other packing
plasmids were then cotransfected by transient calcium phosphate to
pack lentiviruses in 293T cells. Lentiviral vectors were harvested and
concentrated to a level of 108.
As a high specificity of siRNA [39–43], the mismatch mutations
in its stem sequences abolish the function of silencing mRNA. Based
on this principle, we introduced a negative control siRNA that mismatches
the sequence of PAR-1 mRNA (called as misRNA for PAR-1)
and has no effect on silencing PAR-1 mRNA. All of the reagents for molecular
biology were purchased from GeneChem Co., Ltd in Shanghai.
2.3. Scores of neurological deficits
The neurological status was evaluated and scored carefully 24 and
72 h after MCAO, or immediately before the decapitation. The scales
from zero to four were used to assess the effects of MCAO on neurological
behavior [32,33]. The rats were suspended 1 m above the
floor by gently holing their tail, and the degree of their forelimbflexion
was monitored. The rats that extended both forelimbs toward the
floor and had no other neurological deficits were assigned grade 0.
The rats without full flexion in their forelimb contralateral to MCAO
were graded as 1. The rats that showed consistently reduced resistance
to lateral push toward the paretic side as well as circling behavior
were graded as 2. The rats that circled toward the paretic side
consistently were graded as 3. The rats with a depressed level of consciousness
and unresponsiveness to stimulation were graded as 4. The
neurological testing was performed by a single observer who was
blinded to know the assignments of three groups.
2.4. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
The rats were decapitated 24 h and 72 h after MCAO and immediately
after the neurological test, respectively. The brain tissues were
removed rapidly, and the coronal sections between 2.5 mm and
4.5 mm from the frontal end were sliced within 3 min of their death.
The sections were immersed in 4% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37 °C for 30 min. The areas of ischemic infarction with TTC
staining appeared gray, whereas the areas in the absence of infarction
were stained as red. The sizes of the infarct areas and whole sections
were analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0. Infarction volume was calculated
based on the formula V=t(A

volume was expressed as a ratio of infarct volume to coronal
section volume in the whole brain.
2.5. Western blot and immunohistochemistry
The samples were obtained from the MCAO side of cortical tissues
including hippocampus. Protein extraction, SDS-PAGE and westernblot
were conducted based on the manufacturer's instructions [34,35].
The concentration of proteins was 2μg/μl. They were separated on an
8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The polyclonal
antibodies of anti-PAR1 and anti-β-actin [F-1804 (Sigma, 1: 4000) and
KC-5G4 (KangChen, 1:4000)] were the primary antibodies for PAR-1
and β-actin, respectively. SC-2005 (Santa-Cruz, 1:4000) was the secondary
antibody in HRP-conjugated. The total protein content was
determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON,
Canada). The intensities of protein bands were measured by the ECL detection
system (Amersham), and were quantified by using an Odyssey
software (v2.1 LI-COR), in which band intensities (area×OD) were
measured for each of the groups and normalized by ß-actin band
intensities.
Immunohistochemistry for HSP-70 and MAP-2: tissue blocks from
the ischemic area of MCAO were sliced in cross section at 20μmbya
freezing microtome. The sections were washed by PBS for three times
and stained by immunohistochemistry. They were incubated in polyclonal
antibodies of anti-HSP70 or anti-MAP2 (Abcam, USA) at 4 °C
with shaking for 24 h, and subsequently incubated in HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit antibodies (Abcam, USA). The distributions of HSP70 and
MAP2 (dark brown in color) were observed under conventional optical
microscope. Five fields were randomly selected in the penumbra
around the infarct areas. Their photos were taken by using Mike Audi

imaging acquisition system. The average optical densities of HSP70 and
MAP2 staining were analyzed by software Image pro plus 6.0.
2.6. Reverse transcription PCR
The samples were obtained from the cortical tissues in the lesion
side. Total mRNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and reversely
transcribed by cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Thefidelity and specificity of sense and antisense
oligonucleotides were tested with BLAST. cDNA samples were
amplified in DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer) in the patterns of 30 s
at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C (β-actin but PAR-1 55 °C) and 30 s at 72 °C for
30 cycles. cDNA levels in PCR were normalized by usingβ-actin as reference.
Primers for β-actin were 5′-GTCAGGTCATCACTATCGGCAAT-3′
and 5′-AGAGGTCTTTACGGATGTCAACGT-3′. Primers for rat PAR-1 were
5′-ACAGTCTGCTACACGTCCAT-3′and 5′-CAGCCACCCTTTCCCTAA-3′.
PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel. cDNA
bands were visualized by GelStar gel staining (FMC BioProducts).
Invariant mRNA of β-actin was used as an internal control to quantify
PCR products. OD values for PAR-1 signals, measured by Kodak electrophoresis
documentation system, were normalized to OD values of
β-actin signals. The ratios were expressed as arbitrary units for quantitative
comparison.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The data were imputed into a database. Their values were presented
as mean±SD. The t-test was used to evaluate the differences among
the three groups. For the within group variances, we first checked all
means for homogeneity of variance test, and subsequently single factor
ANOVA was used for homogeneous data, and the approximate t-test
was used for non-homogeneous data. All values were analyzed using
SPSS (ver. 12.0) software. A significance level of pb0.05 was used for
all statistical analyses.
3. Results
3.1. siRNA-mediated silence of PAR1 in the brain tissues of MCAO rats
In order to test the protective effect of protease-activated receptor-
1 (PAR-1) on ischemic stroke, we applied RNA interference technique
to knock-down PAR1 in brain tissues by injecting the lentiviral vectors
of carrying small interference RNA (siRNA) for PAR-1 (see Materials
and methods) into the left side of the lateral ventricle in Wistar rats.
In the mean time, the lentiviral vectors carrying RNA in a mismatch
sequence (misRNA) of PAR-1 and physiological saline were injected
as the controls. Seven days after these treatments, the rats received
the surgical operations of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by
inserting long nylon suture into left internal carotid artery in 18.6±
0.7 mm. Subsequently, we harvested the brain tissues and tested the
expression levels of PAR-1 mRNA by RT-PCR and protein by westernblot
, respectively.
Fig. 1 shows the levels of PAR-1 mRNA under the conditions of
injecting LV-siRNA-PAR1, LV-misRNA-PAR1 and 0.9% NaCl into the
rats' lateral ventricles. RT-PCR data show that PAR-1 mRNA in brain
tissues appears lower after injecting siRNA-PAR1 (two left columns
in Fig. 1A), compared with NaCl (two, middle) and misRNA-PAR1
(two, right).Fig. 1B illustrates the ratio of PAR1 mRNA toβ-actin versus
time after MCAO, which includes the groups (n=14 for each
group) of siRNA-PAR1 (dark bars), NaCl (gray) and misRNA-PAR1
(white) plus MCAO for 24 (left columns) and 72 h (right). Therefore,
the injections of siRNA for PAR-1 into the lateral ventricle silence
PAR-1 mRNA significantly in the brain tissues with MCAO.
Fig. 2 shows the levels of PAR-1 protein under the conditions of
injecting LV-siRNA-PAR1, misRNA-PAR1 and 0.9% NaCl into the rats'
lateral ventricles. Western-blot data show that PAR-1 protein in
brain tissues is lower after injecting siRNA-PAR1 (two left columns
in Fig. 2A), compared with NaCl (two middle) and misRNA-PAR1
(two, right). Fig. 1B shows the ratio of PAR1 mRNA to β-actin versus
time after MCAO in the groups of siRNA-PAR1 (dark bars), NaCl
(gray) and misRNA-PAR1 (white, n=14) plus MCAO for 24 (left columns
) and 72 h (right). Therefore, the injections of siRNA for PAR-1
into the lateral ventricle reduce the expression of PAR-1 protein significantly in the brain tissues.
The results above indicate that our approach in the use of RNA
interference technique may knock-down effectively. Then, we examined
whether the knock-down of PAR-1 protects the brain tissues
from ischemic injury.
3.2. The knock-down of PAR1 improves ischemic stroke in brain tissues
With knocking-down PAR-1 by siRNA effectively, we examined the
effect of PAR-1 silence on ischemic brain injury. LV-siRNA-PAR1, LV-
misRNA-PAR1 and 0.9% NaCl were injected into the lateral ventricles
of three groups of Wistar rats, respectively. A week after the injections,
these rats received a surgical operation of MCAO. 24 or 72 h after this
surgery, their neurological deficits were evaluated. Subsequently, the
volume of ischemic infarction was measured, as well as the expressions
of PAR-1, HSP-70 and MAP-2 were analyzed (Materials and methods).
Fig. 3illustrates the effect of PAR-1 knock-down by siRNA on neurological
behaviors from the rats with MCAO. Their behavioral deficits
were graded based on neurological scale 0–4 (see Materials and
methods). The plot in the scores of neurological deficits vs. time
after MCAO shows that the scores are significantly lower in a group
of PAR1 silence (i.e., siRNA-PAR1, dark bars) than in the groups of

NaCl (gray) and misRNA-PAR1 (white; two asterisks, pb0.01, n=14).
The lower scores in neurological deficits for the group of PAR1 silence
can be seen at 24 h (left columns) and 72 h (right) after MCAO. Thus,
the knock-down of PAR-1 improves the neurological behaviors of ischemic
stroke.
Fig. 4 shows the effect of PAR-1 knock-down on the volume of
ischemic infarction from the rats with MCAO. The infarction volume
was measured based on TTC staining (see Materials and methods).
The silence of PAR1 appears to reduce ischemic infarction (Fig. 4A).
The plot in Fig. 4B for the ratio of infarction volume to normal vs.
time after MCAO illustrates that the volume of ischemic infarction is
significantly lower in a group of PAR1 silence (i.e., siRNA-PAR1, dark
bars) than in the groups of NaCl (gray) and misRNA-PAR1 (white;
asterisks, pb0.01, n=14). This reduction of ischemic injury volume
for the group of PAR1 silence can be seen at 24 h (left columns) and
72 h (right) after MCAO. Therefore, the knock-down of PAR-1 protects
the brain tissues from ischemic stroke.
3.3. The upregulations of HSP-70 and MAP-2 are associated with PAR-1
silence
In terms of the mechanisms underlying a protective effect of PAR1
silence on ischemic brain injury, we tested whether HSP-70 and MAP-
2, two proteins in the protection of brain cells against ischemic stroke
[30,31], are involved.
Fig. 5 illustrates the levels of HSP-70 under the conditions of
injecting LV-siRNA-PAR1, misRNA-PAR1 and 0.9% NaCl into the rats'
lateral ventricles. Immunohistochemical staining shows that HSP-70
positive cells in brain tissues appear higher after injecting siRNA-PAR1
(left panel in Fig. 5A), compared with NaCl (middle) and misRNAPAR1
(right). Fig. 5B illustrates the levels of HSP-70 versus time after
MCAO, which includes three groups (n=14 for each one) of siRNAPAR1
(dark bars), NaCl (gray) and misRNA-PAR1 (white) plus MCAO
for 24 (left columns) and 72 h (right). PAR-1 silence significantly elevates
HSP-70 in the brain tissues with MCAO.
Fig. 6 illustrates the levels of MAP-2 under the conditions of
injecting LV-siRNA-PAR1, misRNA-PAR1 and 0.9% NaCl. Immunohistochemistry
data show that MAP-2 protein in brain tissues appears
higher after injecting siRNA-PAR1 (left panel in Fig. 6A), compared
with NaCl (middle) and misRNA-PAR1 (right). Fig. 6B illustrates the
level of MAP-2 versus time after the MCAO in three groups (n=14
for each group) of siRNA-PAR1 (dark bars), NaCl (gray) and misRNAPAR1
(white) plus MCAO for 24 (left columns) and 72 h (right).

Thus, PAR-1 silence significantly elevates MAP-2 in the brain tissues
with MCAO.
4. Discussion
With RNA interference techniquetoknock-down protease-activated
receptor-1 (PAR-1) in the brain tissues (Figs. 1–2), we found that the
selective silence of PAR-1 improved the neurological deficits induced
by MCAO ischemia (Fig. 3), reduced the volume of ischemic cortical injury
(Fig. 4) and increased the expressions of HSP-70 and MAP-2 proteins
(Figs. 5–6). Thus, the inactivation of PAR-1 may protect the brain
from ischemic injury through elevating the expressions of HSP-70 and
MAP-2.
The increases of HSP-70 and MAP-2 expressions after knockingdown
PAR-1 indicate that these two proteins, which usually express
under the stressful situation, are involved in the protective effect of
PAR-1 silence on ischemic stroke. PAR-1 coupled G-protein in cell
membrane is activated during ischemia, which activates intracellular
signal cascades (IP3 and Ca2+pathways[32–34]) and in turn ischemic
cell death. However, the mechanisms underlying the highly expressions
of HSP-70 and MAP-2 after PAR-1 silence remain to be studied.
In previous studies, a significant upregulation of PAR-1 was seen
after focal brain ischemia from 24 up to 72 h [9], and infarction volume
was reduced three folds in PAR-1 knockout mice after transient
focal cerebral ischemia [13]. Our results demonstrate the improvement
of ischemic stroke by silencing PAR-1 with siRNA-PAR1. Moreover
, the siRNA-mediated silence of PAR-1 is specific since the level
of PAR-1 in the group of siRNA-PAR1 is markedly lower than those
in the groups of misRNA and saline. Therefore, our study plus previous
reports strengthen the notions that PAR-1 plays a critical role in
ischemic stroke, and an inhibition of PAR-1 would be a therapeutic
option to protect brain tissues from ischemia.
One could argue the safety of using lentiviral vectors to carry
siRNA for ischemia therapy[35–37]. Our studies in the control experiments
, i.e., lentiviral vector of carrying misRNA and 0.9% NaCl, did
not show the detectable differences in the score of neurological deficits
, the volume of ischemic infarction and the expressions of HSP-70
and MAP-2 after MCAO. The use of lentiviral vectors is likely a relatively
safe way for therapeutic goal. Another concern is that there is
not a reason for introducing siRNA-PAR1 into the lateral ventricle as
a prevention tool, since the occurrence of ischemic stroke is not predictable.
It is needed to explore the intelligent ways to warn the risk
of ischemic stroke occurrence in the near future, as well as to deliver
specific reagents (e.g., siRNA and chemicals) into the brain cells to
down-regulate PAR1.
