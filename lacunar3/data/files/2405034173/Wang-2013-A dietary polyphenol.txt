Abstract
Polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) has been associated with Silent Information Regulator T1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) metabolic stress sensors and probably responds to the intracellular energy status. Our aim here was to investigate
the neuroprotective effects of RSV and its association with SIRT1 and AMPK signaling in recurrent ischemia models. In this
study, elderly male Wistar rats received a combination of two mild transient middle cerebral artery occlusions (tMCAOs) as an in
vivo recurrent ischemic model. Primary cultured cortical neuronal cells subjected to combined oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)
were used as an in vitro recurrent ischemic model. RSV administration significantly reduced infarct volumes, improved behavioral
deficits and protected neuronal cells from cell death in recurrent ischemic stroke models in vivo and in vitro. RSV treatments significantly
increased the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio, AMPK and SIRT1 activities, decreased energy assumption and restored
cell energy ATP level. SIRT1 and AMPK inhibitors and specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for SIRT1 and AMPK significantly
abrogated the neuroprotection induced by RSV. AMPK-siRNA and inhibitor decreased SIRT1 activities; however, SIRT1-siRNA
and inhibitor had no impact on phospho-AMPK (p-AMPK) levels. These results indicated that the neuroprotective effects of RSV
increased the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio as well as AMPK and SIRT1 activities, thereby reducing energy ATP requirements
during ischemia. SIRT1 is a downstream target of p-AMPK signaling induced by RSV in the recurrent ischemic stroke model.
Introduction
Of patients with an ischemic stroke, about 23% are reported to have
a prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke (Rothwell &
Warlow, 2005; Correia et al., 2006). More than half of these secondary
strokes occur within 48 h of the initial attack (Chandratheva
et al., 2009). The occurrence of a TIA or minor stroke provides a
distinct opportunity for timely intervention to help prevent or reduce
damage from a potential second subsequent stroke (Johnston & Hill,
2004; MacDougall et al., 2009; Spence, 2010).
Improved diet offers promise as a safe and effective way to
reduce both stroke risk and injury. Resveratrol (RSV) (3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene
) is a promising candidate (Baur & Sinclair, 2006). RSV
is a dietary polyphenol found in a wide variety of common foods
such as berries, nuts, grape skins and red wine, and is speculated to
be responsible for the ‘French Paradox’ (Kopp, 1998). The number
of studies aimed at identifying potential therapeutic roles of RSV in
human health is growing given its various beneficial biological
effects, for example antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-aging,
release of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, modulate mitochondrial
dysfunctions, and control of cell cycle and apoptosis (Raval
et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2007; Yousuf et al., 2009; Das & Das,
2010; Li et al., 2010; Sakata et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2010; Yang
et al., 2010; Dal-Pan et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). RSV has
also been shown to mimic a calorie-restriction diet that extends lifespan
and stress resistance by linking to the longevity gene SIRT1.

SIRT1 is one member of the mammalian family of Sirtuins, a highly
conserved family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that regulate cellular
energy and lifespan in both lower organisms and mammals (Wood
et al., 2004; Pall as et al., 2009). Studies have shown that heightened
SIRT1 activity diminishes oxidative stress-related decline of cardiac
function, and promotes restoration of intracellular energy balance and
resistance of neurons to a number of neurodegenerative diseases
(Ferrara et al., 2008; Murayama et al., 2008; Pall as et al., 2008).
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key metabolic and
stress sensor/effector that is activated under conditions of nutrient
deprivation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, as well as vigorous exercise
and dietary hormones (Turnley et al., 1999). AMPK acts as an intracellular
energy sensor (AMP/ATP ratio) and plays a pivotal role in
maintaining energy balance within the cell (Carling, 2004; Hardie,
2007). Emerging evidence indicates that phosphorylation of AMPK
(phospho-AMPK, p-AMPK) is critical for preserving cellular energy
and for mitochondrial biogenesis in response to energy deprivation
(Suwa et al., 2003). Recently, it has been reported that AMPK also
enhances the activity of SIRT1, which links with cellular energy
balance (Cant o et al., 2009; Finkel et al., 2009).
RSV has been suggested as a potential agent in cardioprotection
(Penumathsa & Maulik, 2009), and has been shown to reduce ischemic
brain damage in animal models (Huang et al., 2001; Raval et al.,
2006; Tsai et al., 2007; Yousuf et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Sakata
et al., 2010). It is currently not known whether RSV might also be
protective in a model of elderly recurrent stroke. Thus, the major goal
of the present study was to determine whether RSV treatments are
effective in reducing neuronal damage following an initial stroke and
prior to a recurrent stroke in the elderly. We also investigated the
neuroprotection of RSV associated with the AMPK and SIRT1 signaling
pathways and cellular energy status in recurrent stroke models.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement and RSV treatment
Experiments were performed on elderly male Wistar rats aged 19–
21 months (Charles River, Wilmington, DE, USA). All animals were
handled in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Chinese
Council on Animal Care, and experiments were approved by the
ShanDong University and TianJin University Animal Care and Ethics
Review Committees (Approved protocol RO8068). The experiments
followed the international guidelines laid down by the NIH in the US
regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures.
A total of 58 elderly rats were used in this study. The mortality
rate was 34.5%. Rats were placed in randomized groups treated with
either a vehicle (a solution of 15–20% Jello powder in water) or
trans-RSV (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). A dose of
25 mg/kg RSV was used in this study; based on earlier reports,
RSV has demonstrated its neuroprotective property in middle cerebral
artery occlusion models in doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg/kg
(Sinha et al., 2002). Thiry-two elderly rats were randomized to
receive either a single mild [30 min transient (t)MCAO] or a recurrent
mild (29 30 min tMCAO) stroke. Animals designated to
receive a single mild stroke were pre-treated with RSV (25 mg/kg
p.o.) or a vehicle daily for 3 days prior to the tMCAO injury. The
behavioral test was performed on the second day of MCAO and
continued daily for 3 days. Brain removal was performed on day 6
(Fig. 1A). Animals designated to receive recurrent stroke received
first mild tMCAO on day 0, then received RSV (25 mg/kg p.o.) or
vehicle treatment daily for 3 days. A second stroke was performed
on day 3 1 h after RSV administration, with the behavioral test and
brain removal being performed on the same day with the single mild
stroke animals (Fig. 1B). Among these animals, six rats were used
to determine physiological variables.
Bioavailability of RSV in blood, brain and liver
RSV levels in blood and tissue were assessed using high-performance
liquid chromatography in elderly rats treated with either RSV
(25 mg/kg, n = 3) or vehicle (n = 3). Blood samples were obtained
at various time points following treatment with either RSV or the
vehicle as described above. After 2 h of the fourth dose on day 3 of
treatment, the brain and liver were dissected and the tissues of brain
and liver were homogenized in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH

1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM
b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 lg/ml leupeptin) on ice.
RSV concentration in the supernatant was analysed by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography (LC/
MS/MS) analysis. This was carried out with an Agilent 1100 chromatograph
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled
with an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped
with a Turbo-Ionspray Interface (AB Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada).
Recurrent stroke model
Procedures for transient focal ischemia were achieved by placing a
microaneurysm clip (Codman, size no. 1) on the middle cerebral artery
through a small burr hole in the skull, as previously described (Qiao
et al., 2009a,b). The animal was anesthetized with isoflurane (4%
induction, 2% maintenance). Rectal temperature was maintained using
a servo-regulated overhead heating lamp at 37.0–37.5 °C during both
surgery and recovery periods until the animal regained consciousness.
The tail artery was cannulated with PE50 tubing to continuously monitor
arterial blood pressure and to obtain blood samples for determination
of blood gas and glucose levels during the procedure. Both
common carotid arteries were isolated and then an incision was made
in the temporalis muscle. The skin and muscle were retracted to
expose the skull. A small craniotomy was made at the point where the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) crossed the rhinal fissure. Prior to
removing the dura over the MCA, two additional burr holes were
made to allow for laser Doppler flowmetry determination of blood
flow. One hole was made 3 mm dorsal to the site of the MCA
(referred to as proximal) and the other 3 mm posterior to the first hole
(referred to as distal). Once baseline blood flow measurements were
obtained, the dura was removed to expose the MCA, which was then
subsequently occluded with the microaneurysm clip. Concurrently,
both common carotid arteries were occluded using vascular clamps.
Blood flow reduction was confirmed with laser doppler flowmetry.
Animals were excluded if the criterion of 90% bloodflow reduction in
the core was not met. At the end of the 30-min occlusion, the microclip
was removed and the carotid artery clamps were removed.
For animals that were to undergo a second stroke, artificial dura
(Gore Preclude MVP; Better Hospital Supplies Corp., Miami, FL,
USA) was placed over the exposed MCA to minimize adhesion to the
vessel and fibrosis infiltration. All wounds were securely sutured and
topical anesthetic was applied (lidocaine; Sigma-Aldrich). Analgesia
(0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine s.c.; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered to
minimize pain and animals were monitored closely during recovery.
Three days later, the rats that were to receive a recurrent stroke underwent
tMCAO in a similar manner as described above. The position of
the second clipping of the MCA was immediately dorsal to the original
clip position to minimize trauma to the vessel. Following surgery
rats were given softened food to minimize weight loss.
Infarct volume measurements
Infarct volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma-Aldrich) staining and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
TTC staining
TTC staining was performed according to the procedure described
previously (Lin et al., 1993). Infarct volume was determined using
an image analyser (Axiovision LE 4.1; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
MRI
Three days after MCAO, MRI scans were acquired using a 9.4-T/
21-cm horizontal bore magnet (Magnex), an Avance console (Bruker
, Germany) and a 3-cm quadrature coil according to the procedure
previously decsribed (Qiao et al., 2009a,b). In brief, T2
imaging was performed using a multi-echo spin-echo sequence with
a TE = 10 ms between echoes for a total of 32 echoes
(TR = 5000 ms). The field of view was 2.5 cm2 and the data matrix
was 2569 128 for slices at a thickness of 1 mm through the cerebrum.
Calculation of infarct volume was performed by the summation
of the ‘infarct area of each of the slices in T2 images
multiplied by Slice Thickness’ using the software program Marevesi.
A percentage of the infarct volume with respect to the contralateral
normal hemisphere was taken for analysis.
Behavioral tests
Rat behavior was evaluated on a horizontal ladder task and cylinder
task on the second day of single or double MCAO and continued
daily for 3 days (Smith et al., 2007). The horizontal ladder task is
designed to assess sensory motor function. The ladder test consisted
of a 115-cm-long horizontal ladder, with a distance of 3.5 cm
between successive rungs. The ladder was placed at a height of
3 cm above the glass walkway. Sugar pellets were placed as a
reward in a blacked out box at one end of the apparatus. Animals
then ran across the apparatus three times per testing session with
the number of paw-placement errors quantified each time from
video tape. Error rate was determined as the percentage of
slips made while traversing the variably spaced segment of the
apparatus.
The cylinder task measures spontaneous limb preference during
exploration of a vertical Plexiglas cylinder under red light conditions.
To determine forelimb-use asymmetry, rats were placed in a
transparent cylinder (20 cm diameter and 30 cm height); independent
use of the left or right forelimb vs. the simultaneous use of
both forepaws was assessed for: (i) the initial contact of the cylinder
wall a full rear and (ii) all weight-bearing lateral movements along
the wall. Limb use was assessed over ten independent rear views.
Primary neuronal cell culture
Primary cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18
Wistar rat fetuses obtained from pregnant females using a previously
described method with some modifications (Domoki et al., 2009).
After isolation, cortical cells were placed on poly-D-lysine-coated
plates (BD Bioscience, Mississauga, ON, Canada) at a density of
approximately 100 cells/cm2 and were maintained in growth medium
consisting of neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (2%;
Gibco), L-glutamine (0.5 mM; Invitrogen), Pen-Strep (100 IU; Invitrogen
) and KCl (25 mM). Cultures were treated with cytosine b-D-
arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, 10 l; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON,
Canada) on days 3–6 to prevent the growth of astrocytes. This
method resulted in a culture of ~99% pure neurons at day 7. Experiments
were carried out on 6- to 10-day-old cultures.

concentration in plasma in our pre-experiments. The dose of 0.5 lM
RSV is about the same as the peak level of 0.45 lM measured in
the plasma. Cortical neuronal cells were pretreated with 0.5 lM
RSV or vehicle for 3 h, then were exposed to an OGD environment
[glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 5%

, < 1% O

and 95% N

] for 30 min followed by re-oxygenation
for 3 h under normal culture environment in regular DMEM media.
After 3 h of re-oxygenation, the cells received a secondary OGD
treatment for 30 min. Cell viability was measured by 0.4% Trypan
blue staining.
SIRT1 deacetylase activity assay and Western blotting
SIRT1 deacetylase activity was evaluated in crude nuclear extract
from penumbra cortex tissue 3 days after MCAO and cortical neuronal
cells 3 h after OGD. Penumbra cortex was determined by using
hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining on the alternating cryosections
(20 lm). The morphological differences between necrosis and apoptosis
regions were observed, the necrosis ischemia core was
removed and the apoptosis penumbra region was kept. SIRT1 activity
was measured using a deacetylase fluorometric assay kit (#CY-
1151; CycLex, MBL International Corp.) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (Ferrara et al., 2008). A standard calibration curve,
Relative Fluorescence Units, was prepared with a known amount of
the deacetylated standard included in the kit. All determinations
were performed in triplicate on six different samples.
SIRT1 expression was tested by Western-blot assay. The samples
of nuclear extract from penumbra cortex tissue and neuronal cells
were separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted using mouse anti-purified
recombinant fragment of human SIRT1 monoclonal first antibodies
which react with rat, human and monkey (1 : 1000; ab104833, tested
applications include Western-blot, Immunohistochemistry-paraffin
flow cytometry, Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence and
ELISA; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Blots were developed with
goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibodies
(1 : 2000) (#115-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch,) and
enhanced by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Amersham). The
intensities (density area) of individual bands were measured by densitometry
(Model GS-700; Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad).
AMPK activity assay
AMPK activity was evaluated in protein extract from penumbra
cortex tissue 3 days after MCAO and cortical neurons 3 h after
OGD reperfusion with or without RSV treatment. Western blots
and phosphorylation assays were performed as described previously
(Liu et al., 2010). Rabbit anti-p-AMPK (Thr-172) of human
AMPKalpha monoclonal first antibodies which react with rat,
mouse and human (1 : 1000) (#2535, tested application include
Western blot, Immunoprecipitation and Immunohistochemistryparaffin; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) were
used for immunoblotting to detect AMPK activity. The blots were
developed with goat anti-rabbit HRP-linked secondary antibodies
(1 : 2000) (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The intensity
was measured in the same way as SIRT1, as described above.
Measurement of NAD+/NADH ratio
NAD+/NADH were measured using the NAD+/NADH Assay Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ab65348; Abcam, www.
abcam.com).
Measurement of ATP levels
Intracellular ATP levels were measured in penumbra brain tissue
3 days after tMCAO and cortical neurons 3 h after OGD exposure.
The ATP content in the supernatants was determined using an ATP
Bioluminescence Assay kit CLSII (#1699695; Roche Diagnostics,
Barcelona, Spain), following the procedure recommended by the
manufacturer (Troyano et al., 2001). Results were normalized
according to the protein content of the extracts.
The effects of SIRT1 and AMPK inhibitors and specific small
interfering (si)RNA on RSV neuroprotection
To demonstrate a direct correlation between the neuroprotection of
RSV treatment and regulation of SIRT1 and AMPK, cortical neurons
were exposed to the SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol (100 lM; Calbiochem,
La Jolla, CA, USA) or the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin dihydrochloride
(20 lM; Tocris Bioscience, USA) overnight before being
treated with 0.5 lM RSV for 3 h, then undergoing single or recurrent
OGD insults. Cell viability was measured as described above.
To further confirm the direct correlation between protection by
RSV treatment and regulation of SIRT1 and AMPK, cortical neurons
were transfected with SIRT1 siRNA and AMPK siRNA,
respectively. SIRT1 siRNA was synthesized by Eurogentec (Guarani
et al., 2011; 5′GAAGTTGACCTCCTCATTG3′), and AMPK
siRNA was purchased from B-Bridge International (5′GAGGAGAGCTATTTGATTA3′; Nakano et al., 2010). A scrambled
siRNA (5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGGCACGA-3′) was used as a negative
control for SIRT1, and siControl (B-Bridge International) was
used as a negative control for AMPK. Cells were transfected with
the indicated siRNAs (50 nM) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen
) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubation with
siRNAs for 24 h, the cells received RSV and OGD treatment and
were then harvested and analysed.
Analysis of SIRT1 and AMPK signaling pathway induced by
RSV
To understand whether SIRT1 and AMPK act in the same pathway
or if they represent separate parallel pathways, we measured the
effects of AMPK siRNA and inhibitor dorsomorphin dihydrocholoride
on SIRT1 activity levels, and the effects of SIRT1 siRNA and
inhibitor sirtinol on p-AMPK levels as well. Cortical neurons were
exposed to SIRT1 and AMPK siRNA for 24 h, and then treated
with RSV for 3 h. SIRT1 activity and p-AMPK levels were tested
as described above.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SigmaStat (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). Differences between groups were assessed with a t-test or
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and followed by a Tukey
(Student–Neumann–Keuls) multiple comparisons of means tests.
Data are expressed as means  SD. A value of P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.

first hour (Fig. 1C). RSV was detected in significant amounts in the
liver (100 17.8 nM) and brain homogenates (55  11.8 nM) when
measured 2 h after the fourth dose of 25 mg/kg RSV (Fig. 1D).
Very small amounts of RSV were also observed in the tissue of
control animals; however, this was considered to arise from RSV
levels that might have been present in the routine rat lab diet or that
could have been artifactual background in the assay.
RSV treatment significantly reduced infarct volumes and
improved recovery of behavioral deficits in recurrent stroke
models
At the time of tMCAO, the cerebral blood flow measured within the
core ipsilateral to the occlusion decreased to 7.6 2.8 and
7.9 2.6% in the vehicle and in RSV-treated single stroke groups,
respectively; 6.4 2.3 and 6.2 3.2% during the first occlusion
period in the vehicle and RSV-treated recurrent stroke groups,
respectively; and 7.6 2.8 and 8.0 3.5% during the second
occlusion period in the recurrent stroke groups, respectively. Because
no significant differences were found in the flows detected in either
the proximal or the distal cortical regions between RSV and vehicletreated
groups at the onset or the end of ischemia (Fig. 2A), the
recurrent ischemic model was considered to be successful.
As shown in Fig. 2B and C, MRI and TTC assays have demonstrated
that RSV treatments significantly decrease infarct volume,
especially in the recurrent MCAO model. In single mild stroke rats,
the infarct volumes of the control group were small
(35 7.2 mm3) but RSV treatment reduced infarct volumes to an
even smaller size (18  4.3 mm3; t-test: P < 0.05; RSV treatment
vs. control). Recurrent ischemic treatment caused larger volumes

blood decreased to 7.6 2.8 and 7.9 2.6% in the vehicle and RSV-treated single stroke groups, respectively; to 6.4 2.3 and 6.2 3.2% during the first
occlusion period in the vehicle and RSV-treated recurrent stroke groups, respectively; and to 7.6 2.8 and 8.0 3.5% during the second occlusion period in
the vehicle and RSV-treated recurrent stroke groups, respectively. No significant differences were found in the proximal or distal cortical regions between RSV
and vehicle treated groups at either onset or end of ischemia. (B, C) Infarct volumes of the control group were 35 7.2 mm3; RSV treatment reduced infarct
volumes to 18 4.3 mm3 (P < 0.01). Recurrent ischemic treatment caused larger infarct volumes (140 30.1 mm3); RSV treatment significantly decreased
infarct volume to 74 14.5 mm3 (P < 0.001). (D, E) Behavioral deficits were significantly more severe in recurrent tMCAO-insulted rats (stepping error
rate = 45 7.8 and asymmetry score = 36 7.6) than in single tMACO-insulted rats (stepping error rate = 10.3 3.9 and asymmetry score = 9.3 4.1,
P = 0.0002). RSV treatment significantly decreased the stepping error rate (29.6 6, P = 0.0047) and the asymmetry score (21.5 5.3, P = 0.0056) in recurrent
MCAO rats. Values shown are the mean SD from three independent experiments; asterisks indicate *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001 as compared with vehicle
(t-test or one-way ANOVA with the Neuman–Keuls post-test).

(140 30.1 mm3, t-test: P < 0.001; recurrent ischemia vs. single
ischemia) and RSV treatment significantly decreased infarct volume
to 74 14.5 mm3 (t-test: P < 0.001; RSV treatment vs. control).
As expected, both single and recurrent tMCAO led to significant
behavioral deficits as measured by either test (Tukey test: P < 0.01;
recurrent and single tMCAO vs. control; recurrent vs. single
tMCAO). As shown in Fig. 2D and E, behavioural deficits were significantly more severe in recurrent tMCAO-insulted rats (stepping
error rate = 45 7.8 and asymmetry score = 36 7.6) than in single
tMACO-insulted rats (stepping error rate = 10.3 3.9 and
asymmetry score = 9.3 4.1; one-way ANOVA: P = 0.0002; recurrent
tMCAO vs. single tMACO). RSV treatment significantly
decreased the stepping error rate to 29.6 6 (one-way ANOVA:
P = 0.0047; RSV treatment vs. vehicle treatment) and the asymmetry
score to 21.5 5.3 (one-way ANOVA: P = 0.0056; RSV treatment
vs. vehicle treatment) in recurrent tMCAO rats. These results
indicate that RSV treatment significantly improved sensory motor
function of rats subjected to tMCAO.
RSV protected neurons from cell death
As shown in Fig. 3, OGD insults resulted in significant cell death,
especially in the recurrent OGD model (Tukey test: P < 0.01; recurrent
and single tMCAO vs. control; recurrent vs. single tMCAO).
Low concentrations of RSV (0.5 lM) significantly protected neuronal
cells from cell death both in single and in recurrent OGD models
, giving a 32 4.1 and a 51  6% increase in the neurons’
viability in single and recurrent OGD models, respectively (one-way
ANOVA: P = 0.0003; RSV treatment vs. vehicle treatment). These
results demonstrate that RSV protects neuronal cells from cell death
induced by OGD, especially in the recurrent OGD model.

protein expression

depict scattered cell death in the penumbra area and extensive cell

removed and the dot area (penumbra area) was kept for further
study. Figure 4B and C show that RSV significantly increased
SIRT1 deacetylase activities in sham, single tMCAO and recurrent
tMCAO rats after administration of RSV daily for 3 days (Fig. 4B,
t-test: P < 0.001, P = 0.0014 and P = 0.002, respectively; RSV
treatment vs. vehicle treatment in sham, single and recurrent
tMCAO, respectively); RSV also significantly increased SIRT1 deacetylase
activities in control, single OGD and recurrent OGD neuronal
cells after exposure to RSV for 3 h (Fig. 4C, t-test:
P = 0.0003, P = 0.0014 and P = 0.002, respectively; RSV treatment
vs. vehicle treatment in control, single and recurrent OGD, respectively
). Single tMCAO or OGD insults alone also slightly increased
SIRT1 activity (Fig. 4B and C, t-test: P = 0.04, single tMCAO and
ODG vehicle groups vs. sham and control vehicle groups), but this
phenomenon was not seen in recurrent tMCAO/OGD-insulted
groups (t-test: P = 0.065; recurrent tMCAO and ODG vehicle
groups vs. sham and control vehicle groups). Surprisingly, SIRT1
protein expression did not show differences (Fig. 4D, Tukey test:
P > 0.05; RSV treatment vs. vehicle treatment in sham, single and
recurrent tMCAO groups, respectively; RSV treatment in single and
recurrent tMCAO vs. sham vehicle) after administration of 25 mg/
kg RSV for 3 days in brain tissue, whereas SIRT1 protein expression
did increase in cultured neurons after treatment of 0.5 lM RSV
for 3 h (Fig. 4E, Tukey test: P < 0.01; RSV treatment vs. vehicle
treatment in control, single and recurrent OGD respectively; RSV
treatment in single and recurrent OGD vs. control vehicle group).
The mechanisms involved are presently unknown.
RSV increased AMPK activity
RSV significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation in sham, single
tMCAO and recurrent tMCAO rats (Fig. 5A, t-test: P = 0.03,
P = 0.019 and P = 0.016, respectively; RSV treatment vs. vehicle
treatment in sham, single and recurrent tMCAO, respectively) and
also significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation in control, single
OGD- and recurrent OGD-insulted neuronal cells (Fig. 5B, t-test:
P = 0.027, P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively; RSV treatment
vs. vehicle treatment in control, single and recurrent OGD, respectively
). Interestingly, single tMCAO or OGD insults alone also
slightly increased AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A and B, t-test:
P = 0.04; single tMCAO and OGD vehicle vs. sham and control
vehicle), but this phenomena was not seen in recurrent tMCAO- and
OGD-insulted groups (Fig. 5A and B, t-test: P > 0.05; recurrent
tMCAO and OGD vehicle vs. sham and control vehicle).
RSV increased NAD+/NADH ratio and promoted restoration of
intracellular ATP levels
Because SIRT1 deacetylase activity is driven by NAD+ levels (Imai
et al., 2000), we examined whether AMPK indirectly activates
SIRT1 by altering the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio in recurrently
ischemic stroke models. Our results show that tMCAO and
OGD insults significantly decreased intracellular NAD+/NADH
ratio (Fig. 6A and B; one-way ANOVA: P = 0.012; P = 0.001; single
tMCAO and OGD vehicle vs. sham and control vehicle), in recurrent
tMCAO and OGD models, in particular, the ratio decreased to
only 28 16 of sham and 54 21% of control levels (Fig. 6A
and B; one-way ANOVA: P < 0.001; recurrent tMCAO and OGD
vehicle vs. sham and control vehicle). RSV treatments significantly
increased the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio to 239 18% in
single MCAO and 204  25% in recurrent MCAO groups
(Fig. 6A, one-way ANOVA: P < 0.001; RSV treatment vs. vehicle
Fig. 3. RSV protected neurons from cell death induced by ODG. OGD
insults resulted in significant cell death both in single and in recurrent OGD
models (P = 0.007), and especially in the recurrent OGD model
(P = 0.0002). RSV treatment (0.5 lM) gave a 32 4.1 and a 51 6%
increase in cell viability in single and recurrent OGD models, respectively
(P = 0.0003). Values shown are the mean SD from three independent

was observed in cultured neuronal cells, where the NAD+/NADH
ratio was increased to 279 22% in the single OGD group and to
243 19% in the recurrent OGD group (Fig. 6B, one-way ANOVA:
P < 0.001; RSV treatment vs. vehicle treatment in single and
recurrent OGD). These results further support the hypothesis that
change in NAD+ levels translate AMPK effects onto SIRT1
activity.

AMPK and SIRT1 signaling pathway induced by RSV in
recurrent ischemic stroke
Results show that RSV significantly increased SIRT1 activities
p-AMPK levels in control, single OGD- and double OGD-insulted
cortical neurons (Fig. 8A and B, Tukey test: P < 0.001; RSV treatment
vs. vehicle treatment in control, single and double OGD
groups, respectively; RSV treatment in single and double OGD
groups vs. control vehicle group), and both AMPK siRNA and
inhibitor significantly abolished SIRT1 activity levels induced by
RSV (Fig. 8A, t-test: and P < 0.001; AMPK siRNA and inhibitor
plus RSV treatments vs. RSV treatment alone in each group); however
, the impact of SIRT1 siRNA and inhibitor on p-AMPK levels
were not observed (Fig. 8B, t-test: P > 0.05; SIRT1-siRNA and
inhibitor plus RSV treatments vs. RSV treatment alone in each
group). These results indicate that SIRT1 is one of the downstream
targets of RSV/AMPK signaling; they also indicate that AMPK is
one of the upstream molecules in RSV/SIRT1 signaling.
Discussion
Because more than half of secondary strokes associated with TIA or
minor strokes occur within 24 h to 1 week of the initial attack (Roquer et al., 2010), greater clinical effectiveness of neuroprotective
drugs would be expected if one could administer treatment prior to
the recurrent stroke, particularly if the treatment had few or no side
effects. To seek potential clinically effective therapies for recurrent
stroke, a novel translationally relevant model of elderly recurrent
stroke consisting of an initial mild stroke followed by a second
stroke was developed successfully in this study. This model is a useful
tool in investigating the molecular mechanisms of recurrent
stroke and will assist in the translation to clinical testing of pre-clinical
stroke prevention strategies. Epidemiological evidence shows
that the elderly, in comparison with the general population, are at
higher risk and disproportionately suffer more disability and mortality
following stroke (Paolucci et al., 2003). In this study, we used
elderly rats (19–21 months) to construct the recurrent stroke model,
making the aspects of the model more translationally relevant. As
clinical statistical data show that more than half of recurrent strokes
associated with TIA or minor strokes occur within 24 h to 1 week
of the initial presentation, we selected a 72-h delay to induce the
secondary stroke in our elderly animal model to reflect this life phenomenon.
The delayed phase of ischemia and reperfusion brain
damage is present from day 3 onwards (Shichita et al., 2011). We
then evaluated and analysed the ischemic lesion and behavioral deficits
post 2nd stroke beyond the 72-h acute period, which significantly
increased the relevance of the work presented.
Numerous studies indicate that RSV’s effects appear organ-specific and vary depending on dosage. In these studies, intermediate
doses tend to be the most cardioprotective or neuroprotective (Della-
Mortem et al., 2009). RSV, the unique phytoalexin present in red
wine, delivers either a survival signal or a death signal to the ischemic
myocardium depending on the dose (Dudley et al., 2012). The
25 mg/kg RSV dose selected for our elderly recurrent stroke model
falls within the range 20–50 mg/kg demonstrated previously to have
neuroprotective effects in MCAO models (Sinha et al., 2002). The
dose of 0.5 lM RSV, which is about the same as the peak level of
0.45 lM measured in the plasma, was used in primary cultured cortical
neuronal cells. Results show that 25 mg/kg RSV significantly
reduced infarct volume and improved behavioral deficits in recurrent
ischemic stroke and that 0.5 lM RSV protected neuronal cells from
cell death induced by OGD. RSV was detected in significant but
different amounts in the liver (100 17.8 nM) and brain homogenates
(55 11.8 nM). Drug metabolism and disposition studies show
that RSV demonstrates high oral absorption but rapid and extensive
metabolism. Extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestine/
liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in RSV’s bioavailability
and organ specificity (Walle et al., 2004; 2009; Della-Mortem et al.,
2009). This may explain our results as the RSV concentration

obtained was much higher in the liver than in the brain when measured
2 h after oral administration of the fourth dose. The length of
time and the RSV dosage required to obtain optimal concentration
in the brain tissue along with the optimal route of administration
both need further investigation.
Our results show that SIRT1 expression was increased in cultured
neuronal cells treated with 0.5 lM RSV for 3 h. Surprisingly, SIRT1
expression was not affected in the brain tissue of rats treated with
25 mg/kg RSV daily for 3 days. We suspect that SIRT1 expression
and SIRT1 activities are probably related to in vivo and in vitro
micro-environments, time-course and post-translational alterations as
well. Clearly, brain tissues are more complex than the in vitro cortical
neuronal culture. Non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes, microglia
or oligodentrocytes in brain tissue were activated and they
released different inflammatory cytokines following an ischemic
stroke (Benjelloun et al., 1999). RSV treatment reduced neurodegeneration
, therefore resulting in decreased inflammation (Baur &
Sinclair, 2006). However, RSV would not exert the same effect on
the pure culture cortical neurons because the other cell types were
not present. The SIRT1 expression and SIRT1 activities are probably
related to time-course as well. Previous studies have shown that
RSV treatment increased SIRT1 activity in organotypic hippocampal
slices 30 min after treatment and SIRT1 activation returned to baseline
levels by 48 h (Raval et al., 2006). SIRT1 activity was significantly
increased at 48 h after ischemic preconditioning, but did not
change at 30 min (Raval et al., 2006). We suspect that the SIRT1
expression had increased at an earlier time and had returned to the
baseline after 72 h in this study. Moreover, the incongruity between
SIRT1 expression and activity (in vivo) may relate to the post-translational
alterations of SIRT1 that enhance activity without increasing
expression. In conclusion, the mechanisms of SIRT1 expression and
activities need further investigation.
RSV administration has been effective in reducing damage in a
number of cell cultures and animal models of central nervous system
ischemia (Raval et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2008; Della-Mortem
et al., 2009; Yousuf et al., 2009). However, none of these studies
investigated the neuroprotection of RSV administration in a recurrent
stroke model that could provide the basis for clinical investigation.
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that RSV
treatment remarkably reduces infarct volumes, dramatically improves
recovery on behavioral deficits in elderly recurrent ischemic animal
model and protects neuronal cells from cell death induced by recurrent
OGD insults. With respect to understanding how RSV reduces
damage with cerebral ischemia, there is much recent information
regarding the nitric oxide and adenosine, NF-jB-COX2, SIRT1-
UCP2 and/or AMPK signaling pathways and how they may be
affected by RSV (Bradamante et al., 2003; Dasgupta & Milbrandt,
2007; Della-Mortem et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2011). RSV treatment
resulted in a robust increase in AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation
within 2 h that persisted for up to 72 h in neuro2A neuroblastoma
cells (Dasgupta & Milbrandt, 2007). OGD insults induced AMPK
activated by 30 min, reached peak levels 2 h after OGD and
declined to control levels at 6 h in endothelial cells (Liu et al.,
2010). Our results show for the first time that RSV stimulates
AMPK activity in cortical neurons in elderly recurrent stroke models
(in vivo) for up to 72 h and lasts at least 3 h in primary cultured
neurons (in vitro). We demonstrate that RSV treatment increases the
intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio, increases SIRT1 activities, up-regulates
AMPK phosphorylation and promotes restoration of intracellular
ATP levels in elderly recurrent stroke models. These results are
consistent with a previous study showing that RSV activated SIRT1
by altering the interacelluar NAD+/NADH ratio, leading to deacetylation
, thus limiting rRNA transcription, reducing energy consumption
and further protecting cells from energy deprivation-dependent
apoptosis (Murayama et al., 2008). We also demonstrate that both
SIRT1- and AMPK-specific inhibitors and siRNA significantly abolish
the RSV-mediated neuroprotection in recurrent OGD-insulted
models. These results confirm that RSV is an activator of SIRT1
and AMPK in neurons (Borra et al., 2005; Dasgupta & Milbrandt,
2007; Yi et al., 2011) and establish that SIRT1 and AMPK are key
mediators of neuroprotection after MCAO/OGD insults. RSV-mediated
neuroprotection thus directly correlates with the regulation of
SIRT1 and AMPK activities. However, it is not clear whether
SIRT1 and AMPK act in the same pathway or whether they represent
separate parallel pathways as deletion of either prevents protection.
We further measured the cross-effects of the AMPK siRNA
and inhibitor on SIRT1 activity levels and the SIRT1 siRNA and
inhibitor on p-AMPK levels. Our results show that AMPK siRNA
and inhibitor decrease SIRT1 activity levels induced by RSV; however
, the SIRT1 siRNA and inhibitor have no impact on p-AMPK
levels. These results indicate that SIRT1 is a downstream target of
p-AMPK activated by RSV; therefore, RSV acts to provide neuroprotection
in elderly recurrent stroke models through the RSV/
p-AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. Our results are consistent with
the report that AMPK enhances the activity of SIRT1 by altering
the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio (Cant o et al., 2009) and that the
p-AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1a signaling pathway plays a critical role in
mitochondrial function, facilitating adaptive energy metabolism in
cells, including the neurons (J€ ager et al., 2007).
To summarize, the current study demonstrates for the first time
that a translationally relevant elderly recurrent ischemic stroke
model has been developed successfully. A dietary polyphenol, RSV,
provides neuronal protective effects in elderly recurrent ischemic
stroke models in vivo and in vitro by increasing p-AMPK levels,
increasing the interacelluar NAD+/NADH ratio and SIRT1 activities,
thereby reducing energy ATP requirements during ischemia; RSV
acts to provide neuroprotection through the RSV/p-AMPK/SIRT1
signaling pathway. These results improve our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of RSV neuroprotedction and provide a foundation
for a new pharmacological approach to neuroprotection in
patients with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both AMPK and SIRT1
proteins are involved in the cellular response to metabolic stress,
nutrient deprivation and hypoxia; it will be interesting to investigate
whether there are additional interactions between these two protein
families in neurons and other cells.
