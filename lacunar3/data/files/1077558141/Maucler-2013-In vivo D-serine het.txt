ABSTRACT: D-Serine, a co-agonist of N-methyl D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors, has been implicated in neurological and
psychiatric disorders such as cerebral ischemia, lateral
amyotrophic sclerosis, or schizophrenia. D-Serine signaling
represents an important pharmacological target for treating
these diseases; however, the biochemical mechanisms controlling
extracellular D-serine levels in vivo are still unclear. DSerine
heteroexchange through small neutral amino acid
transporters has been shown in cell cultures and brain slices and could provide a biochemical mechanism for the control of
D-serine extracellular concentration in vivo. Alternatively, exocytotic D-serine release has also been proposed. In this study, the
dynamics of D-serine release and clearance were explored in vivo on a second-by-second time scale using microelectrode
biosensors. The rate of D-serine clearance in the rat frontal cortex after a microionophoretic injection revealed a transportermediated
uptake mechanism. D-Serine uptake was blocked by small neutral L-amino acids, implicating alanine-serine-cysteine
(ASC) transporters, in particular high affinity Asc-1 and low affinity ASCT2 transporters. Interestingly, changes in alanine, serine,
or threonine levels resulted in D-serine release through ASC transporters. Asc-1, but not ASCT2, appeared to release D-serine in
response to changes in amino acid concentrations. Finally, neuronal silencing by tetrodotoxin increased D-serine extracellular
concentration by an ASC-transporter-dependent mechanism. Together, these results indicate that D-serine heteroexchange
through ASC transporters is present in vivo and may constitute a key component in the regulation of D-serine extracellular
concentration.

D-Serine, an endogenous co-agonist of glutamatergic N-methyl
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has been implicated in human
diseases related to NMDA receptor dysfunction such as
schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cerebral
ischemia.1−4 The pharmacological modulation of extracellular
D-serine levels is therefore an exciting avenue of research for the
treatment of these pathologies. For example, an increase in D-
serine may compensate for the hypoactivation of NMDA
receptors observed in schizophrenia,5−7 whereas a reduction of
D-serine levels could reduce NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in
ischemia or neurodegenerative diseases.4,8−10
The biochemical mechanisms controlling extracellular D-
serine levels in vivo are still a matter of debate. Concerning D-
serine clearance, in vitro studies have shown that D-serine is
taken up from the extracellular space by transporter-mediated
uptake.11 At least two small neutral amino acid transporters
have been suggested to mediate D-serine uptake. The neuronal,
Na+ independent alanine-serine-cysteine 1 (Asc-1) transporter12,13 has a high affinity for serine, alanine, cysteine, and
threonine and is selective for small neutral D- and L-amino
acids.14 Asc-1 is responsible for most of the D-serine uptake by
synaptosomes.15 Another candidate for D-serine uptake is the
Na+-dependent alanine-serine-cysteine-threonine 2 transporter
(ASCT2),16 which has a high affinity for L-alanine, L-serine, L-
threonine, L-glutamine, and L-asparagine, and has a comparatively
lower affinity for D-serine.17 ASCT2 is predominantly
expressed in glia, and, despite its low affinity for D-serine, it has
been implicated in D-serine uptake in cell culture studies.11,18−20

The mechanisms of D-serine release are also a matter of
debate. D-Serine may be released via Ca2+-dependent
exocytosis21−23 or via amino acid heteroexchange through
ASC transporters in neurons and/or astrocytes.24 For example,
experiments on astrocyte cultures and brain slices showed D-
serine release in response to small neutral amino acids,
suggesting the existence of an amino acid heteroexchange
mechanism involving D-serine release coupled to the transport
of another amino acid in the opposite direction.11,25
In this study, we used an enzymatic microelectrode biosensor
that allows selective D-serine detection on a second-by-second
time scale26,27 to directly test the existence of a D-serine
heteroexchange mechanism in vivo. We used local delivery of D-
serine, L-amino acids, or S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC, an Asc-1
inhibitor)28,29 to the vicinity of our microelectrode biosensor.
Using this approach, we identified the function of ASC
transporters in D-serine uptake and release in the cortex of
anesthetized rats, and proposed specific roles for Asc-1 and
ASCT2 transporters in the regulation of D-serine levels.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To obtain direct in vivo information on the rapid dynamics of
D-serine release and clearance, we used a specific D-serine
biosensor made with DAAO purified from yeast. This biosensor
minimizes potential tissue lesions and preserves the integrity of
the blood-brain barrier.26,27 The DAAO enzyme (it preferentially
oxidizes neutral D-amino acids like D-alanine, D-proline, or
D-serine30), but the DAAO-based microelectrode biosensors are
selective for D-serine in the CNS in vivo, as it is highly enriched
in D-serine compared to other neutral D-amino acids.31 We have
previously demonstrated a negligible difference (6%) between
D-serine concentrations estimated by our biosensors and those
measured using HPLC in rat brain homogenates.26 Finally, D-
serine electrochemical signals are undetectable in the
cerebellum, a brain structure known to be devoid of D-serine
in adulthood,32,33 further confirming the specificity of our
measurements.27
Identification of a D-Serine Uptake Mechanism in
Vivo. To study the uptake of D-serine in vivo, we used a
theoretical model designed to study the diffusion of neurotransmitters
in the brain.34 The experimental paradigm consists
of releasing a molecule within the brain parenchyma and
detecting its diffusion with a biosensor placed at a small
distance from the release point. The detected concentration
profile is then fitted with a mathematical equation that takes
into account diffusion, the tortuosity of the extracellular space,
and uptake. In the current study, we used an ionophoretic
source to release D-serine and measured its concentration with
a D-serine microelectrode biosensor placed a few hundred
micrometers away from the pipet (Figure 1A). D-Serine is a
neutral molecule at physiological pH and can be ejected using
the electro-osmotic flow created by the applied potential in the
microionophoresis pipet.35,36 Following this protocol, the
microelectrode biosensor detected an increase in D-serine
oxidation current followed by a return to baseline. This pattern
was reproducible over multiple injections (Figure 1A). In such
conditions, the concentration of D-serine, at a distance r from
the releasing point can be described with the equation:37

Q is defined as the source term, which describes the release of

uptake component which, for simplification, is assumed to be
linear with D-serine concentration (k′C, where k′ is the uptake
constant). Under these conditions, this equation has an
analytical solution described by the following equation:37

and where T

is the duration of the injection, D* = D/λ2 is the
apparent diffusion coefficient in the brain (corrected for

We first validated this model in a gel of 0.3% agar, which has
been found to be a good model for the diffusion of molecules in
the brain extracellular fluid.37 In this model, the current
recorded at our biosensors increased shortly after the initiation
of D-serine ionophoresis, and decayed when the injection was
stopped. These experimental curves were then fitted with eq 2
to yield a computed value of D and k′. In the agar medium, we
determined a value of D = 8.0 ± 0.8× 10−10 m2·s−1 (n = 15)
that is in good agreement with the chemical constants
published in the literature,39 and a very low value of k′ = 1.5
± 0.08 × 10−5 s−1, which reflects the absence of D-serine
reuptake in agar (Figure 1B). We then fitted the pattern of D-
serine extracellular concentrations following the ionophoretic
application of D-serine to the frontal cortex of anesthetized rats
with our theoretical model. The distance between the
ionophoresis pipet and the biosensor ranged from 150 to 300
μm (as determined at the end of each experiment), and each
ionophoretic D-serine injection lasted between 5 and 100 s at
200−1000 nA. For each experiment, we chose a different T
0
because the distance between the pipet and the biosensor
varied (sensitivity of the biosensor and number of D-serine
molecules ejected by unit of current also varied). When a
measurable D-serine signal was detected, T
0
(always between 5
and 100s) was then fixed throughout the experiment and used
for modeling the D-serine curve.
We fitted eq 2 to our amperometric recordings using a set of
five coefficients that could be varied during the fitting
computation. Initial values had to be provided to the model:
the distance between the sensor and the injection pipet (r), and
the duration of the injection (T
0
) were set equal to their actual
experimental values; D* was set to 3 × 10−10 m2·s−1 which
corresponded to D =8× 10−10 m2·s−1 (according to our results
obtained using 0.3% agar) and λ = 1.6 (according to tortuosity
values determined by Nicholson and Sykova37); θ was set
initially at 104, and Q, representing the number of injected D-
serine molecules, was set to 10−11. This initial value was set
empirically, but could vary freely during the fitting process to
end with very different values thatfitted the experimental curve.
The five parameters r, T
0
, D*, θ and Q, were then allowed to
vary freely until the fit converged. The fit was estimated to be
correct if the residuals were evenly distributed around zero, and
if the fitted values of r (distance) and T
0
(duration) stayed
within 20% of their real experimental value (Figure 1C).
When D-serine was injected by ionophoresis into the cortex,
its concentration near the biosensor increased rapidly, and
returned to baseline values much more quickly than did D-
serine in our experiments in agar (Figure 1). Basal levels of D-
serine could not be determined using the current approach but
have been measured around 2.3 μM in the frontal cortex using
similar biosensors.27 The fact that the D-serine signal returned
to baseline was a good indication (1) that all of the D-serine
that had been injected was cleared from the extracellular space,
and (2) that the sensitivity of the biosensor was not affected by
the procedure. When we fitted the theoretical equation to our
in vivo recordings, we obtained an uptake constant of k′ =
0.128 ± 0.01 s−1 (n = 28), which represents the rate of D-serine
uptake in the cortical parenchyma.

Small Neutral Amino Acids Compete with D-Serine
Uptake. No specific D-serine transporter has been identified so
far; however, the Asc and ASCT families of amino acid
exchangers can transport D-serine.15,16
D-Serine is reported to
be taken up by nonspecific small neutral amino acid
transporters of the alanine-serine-cysteine (ASC) family, such
as the ASCT2 or Asc-1 transporters.11,14,15 To determine the
role of ASC transporters in D-serine uptake in vivo, we
examined D-serine uptake in the presence of interfering small
neutral amino acids, which would compete with D-serine for
transporter-mediated uptake. This was accomplished by
infusing L-threonine, L-alanine, and L-serine near the microelectrode
biosensor by reverse dialysis (Figure 2A).
The infusion of L-threonine, L-alanine, and L-serine (100 mM
in the microdialysis probe) strongly reduced D-serine uptake
(Figure 2A). In the presence of these amino acids, D-serine
ionophoresis yielded much higher D-serine peak concentrations
at the biosensor, and the D-serine decay time increased. The D-
serine uptake coefficient (k′) was considerably diminished by
the presence of the small neutral amino acids, reaching 8.2 ± 5
× 10−4 s−1 in the presence of L-threonine (2.6% of the control
value, n = 6, p < 0.01), 2.0 ± 0.8 × 10−2 s−1 for L-alanine
(10.5% of the control value, n =6,p < 0.01), and 4.9 ± 0.8×
10−2 s−1 for L-serine (28% of the control value, n =6,p < 0.01;
Figure 2C), indicating that D-serine reuptake was at least
partially blocked by these amino acids. It should be noted that
L-amino acids are neither substrates nor inhibitors of the
DAAO enzyme,40,41 and thus do not a ffect biosensor
response.42 We also tested two basic amino acids that are not
substrates for the ASCT2 or Asc-1 transporters: L-arginine and
L-lysine.11,14 These two amino acids did not interfere
significantly with D-serine uptake in vivo (Figure 2B). The
value of the uptake coefficient (k′) was 1.1 ± 0.3 × 10−1 s−1 in
the presence of L-arginine (89% of the control value, n =6,p =
0.75) and 1.2 ± 0.3 × 10−1 s−1 in the presence of L-lysine (95%
of the control value, n =6,p = 0.9; Figure 2C). These results
indicate that D-serine reuptake in vivo is inhibited by
competition with small neutral amino acids, suggesting that
ASC transporters such as ASCT2 or Asc-1 are involved in D-
serine uptake.
Distinguishing Asc-1- and ASCT2-Mediated Transport
Using S-Methyl-L-cysteine or L-Asparagine. Of the Asc
family, only the Asc-1 subtype is present in the brain, and is
predominantly expressed in neurons. The high affinity of Asc-1
for D-serine (K
M
=20μM)15 has made it the primary candidate
for D-serine transport in vivo.11,24,43 ASCT transporters are
Na+-dependent, and both ASCT1 and ASCT2 are present in
the brain 16 However, ASCT1 does not appear to transport D-
serine.44 As the affinity of ASCT2 for D-serine is lower than that
of Asc-1 (about 1 mM),20 its role in D-serine regulation has
been underappreciated. However, in synaptosomes prepared
from Asc-1 knockout mice, a residual D-serine uptake could be
detected that was likely reliant upon ASCT2 transporters.
Therefore, significant D-serine uptake through ASCT2 transporters
could not be excluded a priori.
To identify the role for each of these subtypes, we infused rat
cortex with L-asparagine, a specific substrate of ASCT2
transporters with very low affinity for Asc-116,17 and one of
the most efficient inhibitors of ASCT2-mediated D-alanine
transport.12,17 We also administered SMLC, an Asc-1 transporter
blocker that is inactive on system A transporters or
serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate reuptake.28,29 Benzylserine
, another pharmacological compound that blocks ASCT2
transporters,45 could not be used in this study because it
produced a nonspecific electrochemical signal that was detected
by our biosensor. We found that L-asparagine (100 mM)
infused into the vicinity of the D-serine biosensor successfully
competed with D-serine. Under these conditions, the D-serine
reuptake constant decreased from 5.6 ± 1.6 × 10−2 s−1 to 4.3 ±
1.5 × 10−2 s−1 (−24.7%, n = 6, p = 0.011, Figure 3A, C).
Similarly, SMLC (1 mM) infusion reduced the D-serine uptake
coefficient from 5.1 ± 1.3 × 10−2 s−1 to 3.3 ± 1 × 10−2 s−1
(−35.6%, n = 6, p = 0.015, Figure 3B, C). These results
therefore indicate that D-serine reuptake in vivo is mediated by
both ASCT2 and Asc-1.
Interestingly, 1 mM SMLC infusion did not produce any
significant change in D-serine basal level. However, in a recent
microdialysis study, Ishiwata et al. detected an increase in
extracellular D-serine in response to 1 mM, but not 100 μM
SMLC.29 This apparent discrepancy probably results from the
fact that our electrochemical recordings were performed at a
distance of about 500 μm from the microdialysis probe, at
which the effective SMLC concentration was much lower. The
fact that SMLC did not change basal D-serine levels at the
biosensor suggests that its concentration was probably in the
order of 100 μM or below, at which no change in other L-amino
acids have been detected.29
Figure 3. Asc-1 and ASCT2 contribute to D-serine reuptake. (A) Infusion of L-asparagine, a specific substrate of ASCT2 (n = 6) or (B) SMLC, a
specific Asc-1 inhibitor (n = 6), both decreased D-serine reuptake. (C) Summary results of D-serine uptake inhibition by L-asparagine or SMLC,

serine alone is injected. *p < 0.05.

D-Serine Release Evoked by Small Neutral Amino
Acids. In our reverse dialysis experiments, we rapidly delivered
large amounts of L-amino acids into the vicinity of the D-serine
microelectrode biosensor. Because ASC transporters are known
to mediate amino acid hetero-exchange in vitro,11,12,25 we were
interested in determining the effects that increased small
neutral amino acid concentrations may have upon extracellular
D-serine levels. The infusion of L-alanine, L-threonine, or L-
serine into the rat cortex induced a rapid, transient increase in
the oxidation current measured by the D-serine microelectrode
biosensor. This transient increase in D-serine level was followed
by a return to a slightly elevated baseline (Figure 4A). For
example, L-threonine infusion induced an increase in the D-
serine extracellular concentration peaking at 16 ± 5 μM (Figure
4A). By contrast, infusion of basic amino acids such as L-lysine
or L-arginine, that are not substrate for ASCT2 or Asc-1
transporters, produced only a small shift in the baseline D-serine
oxidation current recorded by the microelectrode biosensor
(Figure 4B). There was no difference between the shift in the
baseline current at the biosensor after L-arginine or L-lysine
infusion and that observed 15−20 min after L-serine, L-alanine,
or L-threonine infusion (well after the peak in D-serine
concentration). Therefore, there was no evidence that the D-
serine extracellular concentration remained significantly
elevated after its transient increase induced by small neutral
amino acids. The slight shift in the baseline electrochemical
current was more likely due to a small nonspecific oxidation
current due to the large amounts of L-amino acids delivered to
the tissue.
As L-alanine, L-threonine, and L-serine can compete with D-
serine reuptake at the ASCT2 and Asc-1 transporters, it could
be argued that the increase in D-serine concentration evoked by
infusion of these amino acids may result from an inhibition of
D-serine reuptake, followed by D-serine accumulation in the
extracellular space. It is unlikely, however, that reuptake
blockade alone could explain the kinetics of D-serine
concentration changes that we observed. Transporter blockade
usually produces a slow, long lasting increase in neurotransmitter
levels (see, for example Oldenziel et al.46 for
blockade of glutamate transporters, or Martina et al.47 for
blockade of glycine transporters), which is not compatible with
the biphasic changes produced by the infusion of small neutral
amino acids. Here, D-serine release probably occurred through
an amino acid heteroexchange that quickly depleted the
intracytoplasmic pool of free D-serine, resulting in a transient
increase in D-serine extracellular concentration lasting only a
few minutes. The D-serine released locally by heteroexchange
was probably cleared by free diffusion into the brain
parenchyma within a few minutes.
We then sought to discriminate the roles of ASCT2 and Asc-
1 in D-serine release. By infusing L-asparagine near the
biosensor, we tested whether ASCT2 transporters would be
specifically challenged to release endogenous D-serine by a
heteroexchange mechanism. However, L-asparagine produced
only modest changes in D-serine-mediated oxidation currents
that were smaller than those produced by L-alanine, L-
threonine, or L-serine, and were not significantly different
from the effects of L-arginine or L-lysine, which are not
substrates for ASC transporters (area under the curve =
1031.66 ± 626 μM·s for L-asparagine, 3490.51 ± 1022 for L-
threonine, and 146.03 ± 35.33 for L-arginine, n = 6). An
ANOVA followed by an LSD posthoc test revealed a significant
difference between these amino acids (F(2,17) = 5.62, p =
0.013) with a significant difference between L-threonine and L-
asparagine (p = 0.02) but not between L-asparagine and L-
arginine (p = 0.34).This result indicates that L-asparagine, that
specifically triggers amino acid heteroexchange through ASCT2
transporters, does not induce significant D-serine release. In
separate experiments, we tested the ability of L-serine to induce
D-serine release in the presence of the Asc-1 blocker SMLC. We
again detected small deflections in D-serine-mediated oxidation
currents that were significantly smaller than those produced by
L-serine alone (2689.44 ± 1002.41 for L-serine, 382.43 ±
170.38 μM·s for L-serine + SMLC, 146.03 ± 35.33 for arginine,
n = 6). ANOVA followed by LSD posthoc test (F(2,17) =
3.624, p = 0.048) indicated that L-serine in the presence of
SMLC was significantly different from L-serine alone (p =
0.048) but not from L-arginine (p = 0.83, Figure 5C, D). These
data demonstrate that D-serine release was impaired when Asc-1
transporters were blocked by SMLC.
D-Serine release therefore appeared to be mediated by Asc-1
but not ASCT2 transporters. The implication of ASCT2
transporters in D-serine uptake but not release is supported by
their predominant localization in astrocytes (see however ref
16), which possess high intracellular L-glutamine and L-serine
concentration. Therefore, as ASCT2 transporters have a much
higher affinity for L-glutamine and L-serine, they should
preferentially release these molecules when challenged by
extracellular small neutral amino acids.48−50 Previous work has
shown that astrocytes likely release D-serine through other
pathways, such as volume-regulated anion channels or
exocytosis.21,23,24
Effects of Neuronal Silencing by Tetrodotoxin (TTX)
on D-Serine Extracellular Concentration. We then
determined whether such heteroexchange mechanisms could
be engaged during more physiological functioning of the CNS.
In this regard, several studies have reported that D-serine levels
can be modified by changes in neuronal activity.43,51−55 In the
current experiments, we were unable to observe any obvious
change in D-serine level in response to electrical stimulation in
the cortex or in the hippocampus (data not shown). However,
we clearly detected an increase in D-serine levels in response to
the blockade of action potentials with TTX (+10.7 ± 5% in D-
serine oxidation current, n =6,p = 0.04, Figure 6A). Local field
potentials (LFPs) were apparent on the raw amperometric
Figure 4. D-Serine release evoked by local infusion of small neutral
amino acids. (A) L-Threonine infusion near the biosensor evokes an
initial transient increase in extracellular D-serine concentrations that
lasts approximately 5 min. In contrast, L-lysine infusion produces only
a small nonspecific shift in the baseline current. (B) D-Serine release is
evoked by the infusion of small neutral amino acids like L-alanine, L-
serine, and L-threonine, but not by L-lysine or L-arginine. This amino
acid profile suggests that D-serine release is mediated by ASC
transporters.

trace, before we averaged the signal to measure oxidation
currents.56,57 LFPs rapidly diminished following TTX microinjection
(100 μM), confirming a decrease in neuronal activity
around the biosensor. This effect was accompanied by a slow
increase in the D-serine signal. This increase was not detected
by control biosensors (Figure 6A), and corresponded to an
elevation of extracellular D-serine levels of 0.4 ± 0.09 μM. This
effect is consistent with a previous study by Hashimoto et al.58
Given that NMDA receptor activation can trigger nitric oxide
(NO) release that inhibits SR,54 it is possible that TTX, by
blocking neuronal transmission and NMDA receptor activation
might have relieved this block and induced an increase in D-
serine synthesis and release at least in part through this
pathway.
To determine the involvement of ASC transporters in the
TTX-induced increase in D-serine, we injected rats systemically
with a large dose of L-serine or L-lysine (1 g/kg i.p.). We
reasoned that, as these amino acids cross the blood brain
barrier, these systemic injections would raise the intracerebral
concentrations of L-serine or L-lysine. Elevated L-serine (but not
L-lysine) levels would thus interfere with the normal
functioning of ASC transporters. In preliminary experiments,
we quantified L-serine levels in rat brain homogenates using
HPLC and determined that, 1 h following L-serine administration
(1 g/kg i.p.), the intracerebral level of L-serine had
more than doubled (441 ± 26 pmol/mg wet tissue in control
animals, 1225 ± 276 pmol/mg 1 h after L-serine injection, n =
6, p = 0.036), confirming an earlier report by Pernot et al.27
When TTX was applied in vivo in L-serine injected rats, the
increase in D-serine level was completely blocked. The D-serine
signal remained stable or slightly decreased, similar to control
recordings (−1.3 ± 1 pA, n = 6, p < 0.01, Figure 6B, C).
However, after L-lysine injection, TTX produced an increase in
the D-serine signal (+ 4.7 ±1 pA, n= 6, Figure 6B, C) of similar
amplitude to that produced by TTX alone (+4.3 ± 2.1 pA).
These results indicate that the effects of TTX on D-serine
extracellular concentration are blocked via competition by small
neutral amino acids, suggesting an involvement of ASC
transporters in activity-dependent changes in D-serine levels.
D-Serine Release: Heteroexchange versus Exocytosis.
In addition to transporter-mediated D-serine release, some
studies using astrocyte cultures have suggested that D-serine
may also be released via Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.21−23 By
analyzing synaptic currents in hippocampal slices, Henneberger
et al.55 also suggested that D-serine release could be exocytotic.
In contrast, a recent study found that D-serine can be released
by neurons in primary culture and acute brain slices, and that
this release is essentially Ca2+-insensitive, which is incompatible
with exocytosis.24 In addition, neuronal D-serine release evoked
by heteroexchange with exogenous D-isoleucine can modulate
long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices.25 Although our
results clearly implicate ASC transporters in extracellular D-
serine regulation, we cannot rule out the possibility of an
alternative exocytotic release pathway. Exocytotic D-serine
release could potentially be specific to the synaptic cleft, and
therefore not detectable by our microelectrode biosensors,
which sample the extrasynaptic compartment. D-Serine stores
have been identified in intracellular organelles present in
astrocytes,22,33 and represent more than 99% of total D-serine
present in the brain.27 In our experimental conditions, electrical
stimulation did not produce detectable D-serine release in the
extrasynaptic space, suggesting that if D-serine was released in
response to neuronal stimulation, it would not significantly
diffuse outside the synaptic cleft. Therefore, it is possible that D-
serine is differentially regulated by hetero-exchange versus
exocytosis in the extra- and intrasynaptic compartments,
respectively. These two mechanisms could thus mediate
different kinetics of D-serine fluctuation, whereby fast increases
rely on exocytosis, and slower bidirectional adaptations might
require mechanisms of hetero-exchange.
Up to now, the identification of D-serine exocytosis has been
almost exclusively restricted to astrocytes and Bergman
glia,21,23,55,59 whereas Asc-1 transporters susceptible to release
D-serine are preferentially neuronal. It is therefore possible that
exocytosis and heteroexchange are D-serine release mechanisms
utilized by glial cells and neurons, respectively. In support of
this concept, an interesting model suggesting the existence of a
serine shuttle between astrocytes and neurons has recently been
proposed.49 Because SR expression is predominantly neuronal,
D-serine synthesis would occur primarily in neurons, from
which it would be released into the extracellular space to be
taken up and stored in astrocytes. Our current study provides in
vivo evidence that supports this model by placing Asc-1 and
ASCT2 transporters in key positions to mediate such serine
shuttle (Figure 7).
Figure 5. Asc-1 but not ASCT2 contribute to D-serine release. (A) LThreonine

■ CONCLUSION
The present results indicate that ASC transporters are
important players in the regulation of extracellular D-serine
concentrations in vivo by mediating both D-serine release and
uptake. As D-serine is a potential new target for therapeutic
intervention in schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and
ischemia, it is likely that such hetero-exchange mechanisms will
need to be taken into account in the development of new drugs
targeting NMDA receptor activity. In particular, the development
of specific inhibitors of Asc-1 or ASCT2 transporters
administered alone, or in combination with exogenous D-serine,
appears to be a promising avenue for the pharmacological
modulation of D-serine levels in the brain.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
D-Serine Microelectrode Biosensors. D-Serine microelectrode
biosensors were prepared as previously described.26,60 Briefly, the
biosensors employed here consisted of a 25 μm 90% Pt/10% Ir wire
(Goodfellow, Huntington, U.K.), whose tip (50 or 100 μm long,
depending on the experiment) extrudes from a pulled glass micropipet.
The platinum wire was covered with an electropolymerized layer of
poly-m-phenylenediamine and a manually deposited layer of
Rhodotorula gracilis D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO, EC 1.4.3.3.41,61),
immobilized by cross-linking with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl
ether (PEGDE) at 55 °C during 2 h. This temperature is low enough
to preserve the activity of the DAAO enzyme. The biosensors made
using PEGDE at 55 °C showed a better sensitivity than those prepared
using glutaraldehyde, indicating that denaturation, if present at all, is
not a major problem for the functioning of the biosensors.62
In Vivo Experiments. All in vivo experiments were performed on
male Wistar rats (Elevage Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France)
weighing 250−350 g. Experimental protocols were approved by the
local committee on animals in research at the University Claude
Bernard Lyon I (protocol BH2010-19) and were performed in
accordance with European directive 86/609/CEE. Rats were
anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (Sigma,
Saint Quentin Fallavier, France, 1.5−2 g/kg) and were immobilized in
a stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting Corporation, Wood Dale, IL). Body
temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a homeothermic blanket
(LSI Letica, Barcelona, Spain). An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was
Figure 6. TTX increases D-serine concentration via an ASC transporter-dependent mechanism. (A) TTX microinjection near the biosensor causes a
progressive block of neuronal activity, evidenced by the disappearance of local field potentials, together with an increase in D-serine extracellular
concentration. TTX administered near a control biosensor does not produce any noticeable change in oxidation current. (B) Systemic administration
of L-serine, but not L-lysine (1 g/kg i.p.), inhibits the effect of TTX on D-serine levels, suggesting the involvement of ASC transporters in this process.
(C) Summary results showing a significant inhibition of the TTX effect by L-serine.
Figure 7. Schematic representation of D-serine transport mechanisms through Asc-1 and ASCT2 transporters. D-Serine is synthesized in neurons by
SR, an enzyme whose activity can be up- or downregulated by multiple cofactors. Newly synthesized D-serine is rapidly released into the extracellular
space via Asc-1 transporters, before reuptake by neurons via Asc-1, or by astrocytes, via ASCT2. D-Serine transported into astrocytes could be stored
for subsequent release (forebrain) or degraded by endogenous DAAO (cerebellum). ATP, adenosine triphosphate; PICK1, protein interacting with

placed on top of the skull and regularly wetted with PBS to maintain
electrical contact. Biosensors were implanted in the frontal cortex
(anteroposterior +3 mm from bregma, lateral +1 mm, depth +1.5
mm). Amperometric recordings, at a potential fixed at 500 mV vs Ag/
AgCl, began between 60 and 90 min after implantation, when the
electrochemical current recorded by the biosensor had stabilized. To
estimate in vivo extracellular D-serine concentrations, the oxidation
current recorded in vivo was divided by the sensitivity of the biosensor
in standard solutions at the conclusion of the experiment and
corrected for temperature.
D-Serine Microinjections in Vitro. For D-serine administration by
microionophoresis in vitro, a 50-μm long D-serine microelectrode
biosensor was inserted into a gel made from 0.3% agar diluted in 10
mM PBS, An ionophoresis pipet, with a tip diameter of ∼5 μm and
filled with 1 M D-serine diluted in Ringer’s solution (147 mM NaCl, 4
mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl
2
) was placed at 150−800 μm from the tip of
the D-serine sensor. Following a stabilization period of 10−20 min,
ionophoretic injections of D-serine were performed during 5−100 s at
currents of 200−1000 nA with a MVCS-02C ionophoresis amplifier
(NPI electronics, Tamm, Germany).
D-Serine Microinjections in Vivo. For D-serine administration by
microionophoresis in vivo, a 100 μm long D-serine microelectrode
biosensor was inserted into the frontal cortex of anesthetized rats. An
ionophoresis pipet, with a tip diameter of ∼5 μm and filled with 1 M
D-serine dissolved in Ringer’s solution, was placed at 150−800 μm
from the tip of the D-serine sensor. Following a stabilization period of
60−90 min, ionophoretic injections of D-serine were performed during
5−100 s at currents of 200−1000 nA with a MVCS-02C ionophoresis
amplifier (NPI electronics, Tamm, Germany). The distance between
the ionophoretic pipet and the biosensor was determined at the end of
the experiment, after removing the rat from the stereotactic apparatus,
by placing the biosensor and the pipet at the same coordinates as in
vivo and measuring the distance with a stereomicroscope. No blank
biosensor was used to control the specificity of the D-serine signal
because the signal was always time-locked with the D-serine injection.
Moreover, D-serine injection experiments have been performed and
controlled with blank biosensors by Pernot et al.27
For TTX (citrate salt, Tocris, Bristol, U.K.) pressure microinjections
, a micropipet was implanted at a distance of 150−300 μm
from the biosensor. TTX was ejected continuously using constant
pressure between 12 and 20 psi delivered by a PV820 pneumatic
picopump (WPI, Stevenage, U.K.).
Reverse Microdialysis. The infusion of L-amino acids or SMLC
(Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) was performed by reverse
microdialysis. An Elite 12 microdialysis probe (2 mm long and 0.5 mm
diameter, CMA Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden) was inserted into the
brain, near the tip (0.3−1 mm) of the biosensor. Ringer’s solution was
circulated in the probe at the speed of 3 μL/min by an infusion dual
syringe pump (Harvard apparatus), linked to a CMA 110 liquid switch
(CMA microdialysis) allowing rapid changes of the perfusion solution
from control Ringer’s to a 100 mM L-amino acid solution or a 1 mM
SMLC solution.
Recordings. For amperometric recordings, we used a VA-10
electrochemistry amplifier (NPI electronics, Tamm, Germany) with a
two electrode potentiostat (500 MΩ feedback resistor). Data
acquisition was performed using an ITC-18 acquisition board
(Instrutech, Port Washington, NY) driven with homemade software
based on Igor Pro 6.0 procedures (Wavemetrics, Eugene, OR). The
oxidation current was sampled at 1000 Hz with a 20 Hz low-pass filter
and averaged over 1000 points, yielding afinal sampling frequency of 1
Hz. The applied potential is 500 mV vs Ag/AgCl.
Analysis of Uptake Experiments, Statistics. Analysis of the
uptake experiments was performed with the Igor Pro 6.0 software
package. The fit of the injection/uptake curves was performed using
the fitting tool of the software. Data are expressed as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons between two data groups were
performed using two-tailed Student’s t test for equal or unequal
variances, as determined by the F test (significance level of p < 0.05).
For statistical comparisons of three or more data groups, we used an
ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD posthoc test. The analysis tool-pack
of Igor Pro 6.0 and SPSS 12.0 for Windows were used for the
statistical analyses.
