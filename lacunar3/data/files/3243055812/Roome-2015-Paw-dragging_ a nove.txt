. The test has a low

behaviour of rodents, so pre-training and food deprivation or rewards are not required. Despite these numerous advantages, the cylinder test is
under-utilized to assess forelimb deficits in mice following focal injuries to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, which we attribute to the analysis of
mousebehaviourinthecylindertest.Forelimbasymmetryistheclassicalmeasureofanalysisforthecylindertest.Whenplacedinthecylinder,
rodents naturally explore the walls of the cylinder by rearing onto their hind limbs and touching the cylinder walls with their forelimb paws for
postural balance. The number of paw touches with the wall with each forelimb is easily quantified by filming rodents during this exploration of the
cylinder.Forelimbasymmetryoccurswhentheaffectedforelimbpawmakesfewertoucheswiththewallthantheunaffectedforelimbpawand
isindicativeofdamagetothecontralateralsensorimotorcortex.Inrats,intra-corticalinjectionsofthevasoconstrictiveagent,Endothelin(ET-1),
into the forelimb sensorimotor cortex causes a focal ischemic lesion which results in behavioural deficits in the contralateral forelimb. Deficits
in contralateral forelimb use are readily detected as changes in forelimb asymmetry in the cylinder test in rats

a more sensitive measure of damage to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex in mice than the classical forelimb asymmetry analysis and therefore is
applicable to a variety of focal cortical injury models.
Examination of how the forepaw contacts the cylinder wall following ischemic damage to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex revealed a novel

ischemic damage to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex in mice. Its inexpensive set-up, ease of administration and scoring make this a simple, yet
useful tool to rapidly assess forelimb behavioural deficits in mice.
Protocol
Ethics statement: All experiments were approved by Memorial University of Newfoundland's Animal Care Ethics Committee according to the
guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
1. Mice
1. Useadultmice.Inthisstudy,adultmaleFVBNmice(n=10)between2-4monthswereused.Housemiceona12:12hrreverselight-dark
cycle and provide standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.
2.MaterialsRequiredfortheCylinderTest
1. Obtain a table with a transparent top to film the cylinder test. The dimensions of the table are irrelevant, the top must be plexiglass or glass,
andtheremustbeenoughroomtopositionamirrorbelowthetable.Thisallowsforthemousetobevideotapedfrombelow.Useamirror
belowthetabletoreflecttheimagethroughthecylinder.Asanalternative,useanupside-downcameraifavailable.Thedimensionsofthe
table used in this protocol are 54 x 56 x 66.5cm (w x l x h) with a 51 x 51cm top (w x l).
2. Obtainamirror.Thedimensionsofthemirrorusedinthisprotocolare34x58cm(wxl).
3. Obtain a transparent/plexiglass cylinder for the mouse to perform in. The dimensions of the cylinder used in this protocol are 17.5cm high,
8.8cm I.D, 9.5cm O.D with a wall thickness of 0.35cm. A taller cylinder may be required for more active mouse strains.
4. Placethecylinderonthetabletopandfilmthereflectioninthemirrorbelow.
5. A videocamera and tripod are required. Record videos at approximately 650Kb/s, which is approximately 190Mb per 5 min of cylinder video.
Ensurethatthecamerahasazoomfunctionalitytoensurethatthecylinderencompassestheentirefieldofview.
NOTE: The videocamera used in this protocol is a Sony DCR-SR42, 40x optical zoom, 2,000x digital zoom, 680kpix which uses standard
definition, NTSC interlaced video.)
6. Obtain software for analysis – a media player with video support and playback speed modulation. The media player used in this protocol is
the VLC Media Player v2.1.2.
7. Obtainacomputerwithanoperatingsystemcapableofrunningthemediaplayerandamonitor.
8. Electronic storage for videos is required. Download videos to an external hard drive or copy it onto DVDs for long-term storage.
NOTE: At 190Mb per video, 84 sessions will fit on a 16 GB SD card and 168 sessions will fit on a 32GB SD card. Due to the relative
inexpensiveness of SD media, and the uncertainty in how much time some mice require to complete 20 rears, a 32 GB card is recommended.
Inthecurrentstudy,thevideoswerecopiedfromthecameratoa2TBexternalharddriveandthenrecopiedontoDVDsasbackup.
3.ExperimentalSetupoftheCylinderTest
1. Fasten mirror below the table at a 45 degree angle to the tabletop. Do this using two support brackets attached to the table legs to support
thetopandbottomofthemirror,respectively.Bracketlocationsarenotedinaside-viewofthetable(Figure 1A) and a face-on view of the
table (Figure 1B).
2. Place cylinder on the center of the table. Draw four equidistant lines where the cylinder sits on the table with a black marker (Sharpie) so that
the cylinder can be lifted and returned to the same position (Figure 2). Drawing them on the underside of the transparent tabletop allows the
tabletop to be cleaned between animal tests without dissolving the marker ink.
3. Attachthecameraandtripod.Aimthecameraatthemirrorsothatthepictureislookingdirectlythroughthebarrelofthecylinder.Ensure
that the full inner wall of the cylinder is visible and unobstructed by the base (Figure 3). See a side-on view of the setup, including the relative
angle of the camera and mirror setup, from above (Figure 4A) and from the level of the table, including a mouse rearing (Figure 4B).
4. Prepare cue cards to identify each mouse prior to filming. Ensure that the cards typically include an identification number for each mouse, the
time-point of the test (e.g., 3 days after treatment) and the date of the filming session. Do not include the treatment group on the cue card to
ensure the experimenter is blinded.

4. Execution
1. Start filming. Display the appropriate mouse cue card in front of camera lens.
2. Lower the mouse into the cylinder from the open top immediately after filming the cue card.
3. Begin filming the mouse. Minimize noise during this time, as mice may lose interest in exploring if startled.
4. Observethemicereartoexplorethecylinder.Capturethevideountilthemouseperformsaminimumoftwentyrears.
NOTE: A rear occurs when both forepaws lose contact with the floor and the mouse stands on its hind legs.

1. Playbackthevideoatarateofbetween0.25xand0.67xregularspeeddependingonhowquicklythemouseexploresthecylinder.Usea
mediaplayerthatoffersslowerplaybackspeeds.
2. Quantify the total number of paw touches. Paw touches occur when the mouse rears (Figure 5A), touches the side of the cylinder (Figure
5B), subsequently dismounts with both paws simultaneously (Figure 5C) and lands (Figure 5D). The paw may or may not contact the

contacts. These contacts are tallied – one for each left forepaw touch and one for each right forepaw touch.
3. Quantify the number of paw-drags. Paw-dragging behaviour is distinct from normal paw touches.
1. If the paw contacts the cylinder wall with a full open palm (Figure 6B),itwillslowlyfallawayfromthewall,oftenwithaslighttremor.
The movement begins with the digits dragging against the cylinder wall either in a medial or downward direction, (Figure 6C) before
falling away completely (Figure 6D).Themousewillthendismountwithitsunaffectedpaw(Figure 6E) before landing on all fours
(Figure 6F).Thisisconsideredapaw-dragandshouldbecountedinatally.
2. If the paw does not contact the cylinder wall with a fully open palm, it will graze the cylinder wall with its digits before falling away from
thecylinderwall.Similarly,amousemaydragitspawagainstthecylinderwallbutnotreleaseitentirelybeforedismounting.Theseare

a paw-drag, as it depends on the mouse randomly choosing a direction to explore and does not depend on which cortical hemisphere
was damaged.

Discussion
The key points to establish when quantifying paw-dragging behaviour in the cylinder test are the following: i) quantify the number of paw-drags
versus total paw touches for each paw before brain injury to establish a baseline; ii) quantify the number of paw-drags versus total paw touches
for each paw following the ischemic injury; and iii) discriminate between a paw-drag and the lateral motion of the paw along the cylinder wall
duringlateralrotationofthemouse’storso.
Paw-dragging is a novel behaviour that appears following injury to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex. The appearance of paw-dragging behaviour
therefore can be used as a positive indicator that the forelimb sensorimotor cortex has been damaged. The representative results show that
smallET-1infarctsapproximately2-4mm

incontrasttoforelimbasymmetryanalysiswhichfailstodetectconsistentdeficitsinthepercentofaffectedpawtouchesversusoveralltouches
followingET-1ischemiccorticalinjuries
4-6
. Analysis of paw-dragging behavior therefore is more sensitive in detecting damage to the forelimb
sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, because paw-dragging was maintained up to four weeks post-injury it may also be suitable for analyzing
recovery of function. As we have previously shown that paw-dragging behaviour correlates with damage to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex
4
,
any number of injury models may benefit in having this analysis of the cylinder test. Although large injuries, such as middle cerebral artery
occlusion and traumatic brain injury

 show deficits on the classical forelimb asymmetry analysis of the cylinder test, these deficits often resolve
over time. In these instances, paw-dragging, being a more sensitive measure of damage to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex would be useful
in detecting chronic, more subtle deficits. Similarly in injury models which show less consistent results with the classical forelimb asymmetry
analysis, paw-dragging analysis would be useful in detecting more consistent behavioural deficits. Paw-dragging analysis of the cylinder test has

demonstrated here.
There are a variety of behavioural tests used to analyze forelimb motor and sensory deficits following injury to the sensorimotor cortex. The
Montoya staircase test assesses forelimb reaching and grasping behaviours

. Similarly single pellet reaching and pasta eating tests analyze
the fine motor activity of the paws and digits

. Forelimb asymmetry analysis of the cylinder test is associated with postural support when the
mouse is up on its hind limbs

. Only the number of contacts each paw makes with the cylinder wall is quantified. How the paw makes contact
is not examined and may be further indicative of damage. Previous studies have quantified the duration of support of each forepaw touch and

cost, ease of administration of the test, and the reliability of the paw-dragging analysis that makes paw-dragging analysis of the cylinder test
such an attractive choice in predicting focal ischemic injury in the mouse.
