Baicalin has been shown to provide the neuroprotective effect by alleviating cerebral ischemia injury.
However, little′s known about the underlying mechanism. Here, a cerebral artery occlusion (MACO)/
reperfusion rat model and rat primary cortical neuron culture exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H

O

) were
established to evaluate the effect of baicalin on ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis. We found baicalin
can significantly less neurological deficit and reduced infarct volume in vivo. And it efficiently inhibited
neuronal apoptosis in vivo and vitro, which was especially characterized by the enhancing of transcription
and expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) in a dose-dependent
manner. Furthermore, Baicalin markedly increased myocardin-related transcription factor-A
(MRTF-A) level either in ischemic hemisphere or in primary cortical neuron cultures, whiles the antiapoptosis
effect of baicalin was significantly inhibited by transfected with the small interfering RNA of
MRTF-A (MRTF-A siRNA) in primary cortical neuron cultures. The luciferase assays also indicated baicalin
enhanced the transactivity of MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoter by activating the key CArG box (CC [A/T] 6GG)
element, which was reduced by MRTF-A siRNA, suggesting MRTF-A may participate the anti-apoptosis
effect of baicalin, and MRTF-A was involved in the transcriptional activity of MCL-1 and BCL-2 that was
induced by baicalin. LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) and PD98059 (extracellular
signal regulates kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor) obviously reduced baicalin-induced MRTF-A expression
and transactivity and expression of MCL-1 and BCL-2, which further abolished the anti-apoptotic
effect of baicalin on neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, our data provided the evidence demonstrating
the neuroprotective effect of baicalin partially due to MRTF-A-mediated transactivity and expression
of MCL-1 and BCL-2 by triggering the CArG box, which might be controlled by the activation of
PI3K and ERK1/2.

1. Introduction
Baicalin (5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone-7-β-D-glucuronide) is an
important flavonoid naturally distributing in the dry roots of
Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, which has long been widely used in
Chinese traditional medicine (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Accumulating evidences have shown that baicalin has direct
beneficial effects on cerebra vascular system through inhibiting
apoptosis, decreasing cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury (Cao
et al., 2011b; Li et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2012), reactive oxygen
species generation (Cheng et al., 2013), thrombus formation (Lee
et al., 2014) and so on. Nevertheless, little is known about the
mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic effect of baicalin.
The neuropathology changes following ischemic stress have
been believed to be mediated in part by the transcriptional and
translational controls in some important functional molecules,
such as immediate-early genes (IEGs), heat shock proteins (HSPs),
inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes (Lu et al., 2004; Read
et al., 2001). It has found the up-regulation of IEGs (such as MCL-1,

c-fos), transcription factors and HSPs occurs as early as 30 min
following cerebral ischemia (Lu et al., 2004). The neuroprotective
effect has been also observed after the activation of the Akt-BCL-2
pathway and the enhancement of BCL-2 expression, which results
in the reduction of apoptotic cells (Guo et al., 2010) and blocks the
translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor after focal ischemia
(Zhao et al., 2004).
As a powerful co-activator of serum response factor (SRF),
myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) is a major
regulator of stimulus-dependent transcription of IEGs. MRTF-A has
been found to play a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation,
migration and apoptosis (Cao et al., 2011a). A recent study (Knoll
and Nordheim, 2009) has shown that SRF/MRTF-A, as a pivotal
downstream target for ERK1/2-and PI3K, mediates neuroprotection
against both trophic deprivation and camptothecin-induced
DNA damage, suggesting that SRF-MRTF-A/SRE-driven transcription
was involved in promoting neuronal survival and inhibiting
apoptosis induced by hypoxia/ ischemia.
Based on the importance of MRTF-A-mediated transcriptional
control signal on neuronal apoptosis, we posed that MRTF-A and
its target molecules might contribute to the protective effect of
baicalin on cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis. In the
present study, we showed that baicalin promoted neuronal survival
and inhibited hypoxia/ischemia-induced apoptosis in vivo
and in vitro, which is associated with the up-regulation of antiapoptotic
genes (MCL-1 and BCL-2) transactivity and expression.
Importantly, we hypothesized that MRTF-A played a key role in the
up-regulation of these target genes by baicalin. Furthermore, luciferase
reporter assay showed that the CArG boxes in MCL-1 and
BCL-2 promoters were required for baicalin-induced transcriptional
modulation of MCL-1 and BCL-2 via MRTF-A-dependent
mechanism. Moreover, we also explored the role of PI3K/ ERK1/2
pathway, which has been demonstrated involved in the protection
of SRF/MRTF-A on neurons against trophic withdrawal-induced
apoptosis (Cao et al., 2011a; Chang et al., 2004), in the effect of
baicalin on neuronal survival and expression and transcriptivity of
MCL-1 and BCL-2 gene in MRTF-A-dependent manner.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion
model
All experiments were conducted with the approval of the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n¼40) were divided into
five groups: sham, cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) model
control, low, medium and high dose baicalin-pretreated groups.
Baicalin-pretreated rats were pretreated with baicalin (extracted
from the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and refined in
our laboratory, 96%) at the dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg (b.i.d, p.
o.); others were treated with normal saline. After 3 days, rats were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.). Focal cerebral
ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right MCAO with a nylon
monofilament (diameter criteria 0.25–0.28 mm) with a heparincoated
tip (Tsai et al., 1994). This coated filament was introduced
into the internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery,
up to the origin of the anterior cerebral artery and occluded the
MCA and anterior cerebral artery for 2 h. The filament was then
withdrawn to recover perfusion. Rats that did not show neurological
deficits immediately after reperfusion (neurological
scoreo3) were excluded from the study. Rats in sham-operated
group underwent the same procedures identically, but the MCA
was not occluded. Twenty-four hours later, the neurological deficit
was tested. Then the animals were killed and the ischemic
hemispheres were removed. Half of the samples in each group
were used for determination of infarct volumes, and the other for
the rest of detection.
2.2. Measurement of infarct volume and neurological defect scoring
According to the Longa method (Longa et al., 1989), the neurological
function was scored after 2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion
using 5 scores. Rats with no neurologic defect scored 0;
left forepaws of rats with flexion, adduction and failure to extend
fully scored 1; rats with circling and rotating to the left when
crawling scored 2; rats with falling to the left when standing
scored 3; rats with not walking spontaneously or coma scored 4;
and dead rats scored 5.
The ischemic hemispheres were obtained after 2 h cerebral
ischemia/24 h reperfusion to measure the infarction volume by
Triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) staining as described previously
(Sun et al., 2012).
2.3. TUNEL staining for apoptosis
Fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells was quantified using the
Dead End Fluorometric TUNEL System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis
) on paraffin sections. Fluorescein-12-dUTP-labeled DNA
in the cortex was visualized under the laser confocal microscopy.
Nuclei were counter stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc,
Burlingame, CA, USA). For apoptotic cells, we examined positive
green fluorescent apoptotic nuclei in three or four non-over-lapping
view fields were selected randomly in each slice. Image proplus
image analysis software was used. The average value was
taken as the final result (Cheng et al., 2012).
2.4. Cell culture
Primary cortical neurons were isolated from 1 day old newborn
Sprague–Dawley rats as described (Jiang et al., 2005). Briefly,
cortical neurons were dissociated and cultured at a density of
2106 per plate in 35 mm plates. The cells were cultured in
Neurobasal
s
-Medium (with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine
serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100μg/ml streptomycin) and were
maintained in a humidified incubator in air with 5% CO
2
. Cytosineβ-D-arabinofuranoside (2.5μM) was added at day 2 in vitro after
plating to prevent the proliferation of non-neuronal cells.
2.5. Cell transfection and H

induction
Approximately 24 h before transfection, cells were seeded at
0.3106cells/cm2 onto 24 well plates and then transfected with
various plasmids: a small interfering mRNA of MRTF-A (MRTF-A
siRNA),which were donated by Dr. Tongcun Zhang (Tianjin University
of Science and Technology, PR China), and negative vector
pcDNA3.1 (Promega); the luciferase reporter vectors driven by
MCL-1 or BCL-2 promoter sequence constructed in pGL-3 vectors
and their mutants, the vector pGL-3 (Promega) was used as a
control. MCL-1 Luc and BCL-2 Luc reporter constructs contain one
(MCL-1 Luc, -527/-536: CCTTTTATGG) or two (BCL-2 Luc: -1296:
CCTTTTTAGG; 280/301: CCAAAAAAGG) CArG boxes in their promoter
sequences, respectively; the additional luciferase reporter
constructs of MCL-1 or BCL-2 promoter containing mutations to
putative CArG box were generated using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene La Jolla, CA). The MCL-1 luc-
CArG box was mutated from CCTTTTATGG to AATTTTATAA; the
BCL-2 luc-near-CArG box was mutated from CCTTTTTAGG to
CGCGGATCCG and BCL-2 luc-far-CArG box was mutated from
CCAAAAAAGG to CCAGAGCTCG.
The plasmids were diluted with Neurobasal Medium (without

containing 0.5μg DNA, and 2.5μl Fu GENE HD, and then incubated
in 5% CO
2
at 37 °C. On the other hand, in order to investigate the
effect of baicalin on cerebral ischemia-induced apoptosis and
whether PI3K/ERK1/2 pathway involved in baicalin promoting
neuronal survival, cells were pretreated with baicalin at 24 h before
treated with LY294002 (30μM) or PD98059 (50μM). After
48 h, cells were placed in the culture medium containing a final
concentration of 100uM H
2
O
2
for 30 min (Shi et al., 2009).
2.6. Immunofluorescence assay
Rats' brain paraffin sections were used for the determination of
MRTF-A level using immunofluorescence assay. The deparaffinized
and rehydrated sections were blocked for 1 h with 2 ml of 1PBS-
1% BSA-4% goat serum, pre-incubated in 2.5% horse serum for 2 h
at ambient temperature with anti-mouse MRTF-A polyclonal antibody
(1:200 dilution, sc-32909; Santa Cruz, CA) and then rinsed
with PBS twice for 5 min and incubated for 30 min in specific antirabbit
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50 dilution; Sigma,
USA). Finally, these sections were mounted with DAPI mounting
medium and analyzed using a fluorescence light microscope.
2.7. Apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry
Detection of neuronal apoptosis was performed by flow cytometry
using the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit according
to manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, after incubation
with baicalin (0.7μM, 1.4μM, 2.8μM) for 24 h and exposure with
H
2
O
2
for 30 min, cells were resuspended in 200μl binding buffer
and incubated with 10μl Annexin V-FITC and 10μl PI at room
temperature for 15 min in the dark, and then was analyzed using a
flow cytometer (BD-LSRII, U.S.A.).
2.8. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was
isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was
synthesized from 12μg of total RNA in a 20μl reverse transcription
(RT) system followed by PCR amplification in a 50μl PCR
system performed using an RT-PCR kit (Promega, USA). Housekeeping
gene β-actin was used as RNA loading control. The PCR
primer sequences are as follows: MCL-1: sense, 5′-
TCATCTCCCGCTACCTGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-ACTCCACAAACCCATCCC-3′; BCL-2: sense, 5′-GGCATCTTCTCCTTCCAG-3′
and antisense, 5′-CATCCCAGCCTCCGTTAT-3′. The PCR were conducted
according to manufacturer's instruction and the PCR products
were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were
photographed and densities of the bands were determined with a
computerized image analysis system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro
, CA). The area of each band was calculated as the integrated
density value (IDV). Mean values were calculated from three separate
experiments. The IDV ratios of MCL-1 or BCL-2 to β-actin
were calculated for each sample.
2.9. Western blot analysis
Cell protein extracts were prepared in lysis buffer and protein
concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay
kit. Western blotting analysis was performed essentially as described
previously (Zhou et al., 2007). The specific proteins were
visualized using Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent
(Millipore). The primary antibodies-BCL-2, MCL-1, MRTF-A (Abcam
) and β-actin (Sigma) were used for blotting.
2.10. Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (Xing
et al., 2006). Fourty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity
was measured by using a luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega) on a luminometer (Bioteck, USA). Transfection efficiencies
were normalized by total protein concentrations of each
luciferase assay preparations. All experiments were performed at
least three times with different preparations of plasmids and
primary cells, producing qualitatively similar results. Data in each
experiment are presented as the mean7SD deviation of triplicates
from a representative experiment.
2.11. Statistical Analysis
Statistics was performed on SPSS 18.0 Software (SomersNY).
Values are expressed as mean7S.E.M. Statistical analysis was
performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey′s test. A value of
po0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of baicalin pretreatment on neurological deficit and infarct
volume in rat subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and
reperfusion
Neurological defect scores and infarct volume (Supplementary
Fig. 2 panels A, B and C) confirmed cerebral I/R injury were successfully
induced by MCAO. Neurological defect scores performed
2 h cerebral ischemia followed 24 h reperfusion. The average score
was 3.0371.34 in cerebral I/R rats. And neurological defect was
significantly alleviated in baicalin-pretreated groups at the dose of
100 mg/kg (average score: 1.7170.76) and 200 mg/kg (average
score: 0.7370.64) (Po0.05 or Po0.01), compared with I/R model
group (Supplementary Fig. 2 panel C). Consistent with the change
of neurological defect scores, TTC staining showed that the large
infarct area was observed in ischemia hemisphere in cerebral I/R
rats (39.3477.32 mm3), while it was obviously reduced in baicalin-pretreated
groups at the dose of 100 mg/kg (average infarct
volume: 20.7179.79 mm3) and 200 mg/kg (average score:
11.5575.09 mm3)( Po0.05 or Po0.01 compared with I/R group)
(Supplementary Fig. 2 panels A and B).
3.2. The neuroprotective effect of baicalin against neuronal apoptosis
is associated with its upregulation in anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-2
TUNEL staining showed that baicalin significantly decreased
the percent of apoptotic cells in ischemia hemisphere at the dose
of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg (22.575.73% and 11.374.58%, respectively
) compared with cerebral I/R group (37.57 6.52%) after
2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion (Fig.1 Panel A), suggesting the
neuroprotective effect of baicalin against neuronal apoptosis. And
we found that this effect of baicalin is associated with the increasing
of BCL-2 and MCL-1 levels. The mRNA or protein level of
BCL-2 and MCL-1 was significantly reduced in ischemic hemisphere
of cerebral I/R rats compared with sham rats, however,
significant increased levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 were apparently
observed in baicalin-treated groups at the dose of 100 and
200 mg/kg (Po0.05 or Po0.01) (Fig. 1 panels B and C).
In consistent with the in vivo results, flow cytometry showed
that baicalin significantly deceased the apoptotic rate at the concentration
of 1.4μM (apoptotic rate: 28.072.1%, Po0.01) and
2.8μM (apoptotic rate: 14.171.5%, Po0.01) compared to H

mRNA or protein level of BCL-2 and MCL-1 in primary cortical
neurons was also markedly elevated by baicalin (Fig. 2 panels B
and C).
3.3. Transcription factor MRTF-A plays a key role in the anti-apoptosis
effect and the up-regulation of MCL-1 and BCL-2 levels induced
by baicalin
Our previous study (Cao et al., 2011a) has shown that MRTF-A,
as a co-transcription factor of SRF, plays an important role in
promoting neuronal survival against apoptosis, which is dependent
on the binding of SRF and CArG boxes located on antiapoptosis
related gene expression (such as MCL-1). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that endogenous MRTF-A level was
significant reduced in ischemia hemisphere of cerebral I/R rats, but
markedly increased by the pretreatment of baicalin in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3panel A), suggesting that MRTF-A might be
involved in the inhibition of baicalin on cerebral neuronal apoptosis-induced
by cerebral I/R. At the meantime, baicalin reversed
the decreasing of MRTF-A protein expression induced by H

O

in
primary cortical neurons, which was also consistent with the
change of MRTF-A level in vivo (Fig. 3 panel B).
To determine the exact role of MRTF-A in the neuroprotection
of baicalin on neuronal injury induced by cerebral I/R, we knocked
down MRTF-A using siRNA in primary cortical neurons exposed to
H
2
O
2
after pretreated with baicalin. We found MRTF-A siRNA
(0.5μg) efficiently reduced baicalin-induced the expression of
MRTF-A protein (455%,Fig. 4panel A). Importantly, the inhibition

of baicalin on neuronal apoptosis was also reduced markedly by
MRTF-A siRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 panel B), suggesting
that MRTF-A exactly involved in the anti-apoptotic effect
of baicalin. We next explored whether MRTF-A also participated in
the regulation of baicalin on BCL-2 and MCL-1 levels. As expected,
the increasing of BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA and protein level induced
by baicalin was weakened when co-transfected with MRTFA
siRNA (Fig. 4 panels C and D).
3.4. Baicalin activates MCL-1 and BCL-2 transactivity via a MRTF-A-
dependent mechanism
Based on the role of transcription factor MRTF-A on the baicalin-induced
increasing expression of MCL-1 and BCL-2, we hypothesized
that the effect of baicalin enhancing the expressions of
MCL-1 and BCL-2 via MRTF-A-mediated transcription mechanism.
To test this hypothesize, we investigated the transactivity of MCL-1
and BCL-2 promoters in primary cortical neurons after treated
with baicalin alone or co-transfected with MRTF-A siRNA. Transient
transfection assays showed that baicalin dose-dependently
activated the luciferase gene expressions driven by WT MCL-1 and
BCL-2 promoters (Fig.5 panel A), whereas this effect of 2.8mM
baicalin was significantly repressed by co-transfection of MRTF-A
siRNA in a dose dependent manner (Fig.5 panel B). To determine
whether the transactivation of MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoters induced
by baicalin is dependent on the CArG box, we constructed
the dominant negative luciferase reporter vectors of MCL-1 and
BCL-2 gene promoter (mut-MCL-1 luc and mut-BCL-2 luc respectively
). Our data showed that the baicalin induced transactivation
of MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoters was reduced or abolished after the
mutation of the CArG boxes in MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoters (Fig. 5
panel C), suggesting that baicalin induced transactivation of MCL-1
and BCL-2 promoters through activating the key CArG box, which
was the transcriptional regulatory element transactivated by
MRTF-A.
3.5. PI3K and ERK-dependent pathways contribute to the effect of
baicalin on MRTF-A induction
To determine whether the neuroprotection of baicalin was associated
with PI3K or ERK pathway, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and
PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) were respectively used to inhibit PI3K or
ERK pathway in H
2
O
2
-treated primary cortical neurons after
treated with baicalin. Remarkably, LY29004 or PD98059 significantly inhibited baicalin-induced MRTF-A protein expressions
(Fig. 6 panels A and D), and the inhibiting effect of baicalin on
neuronal apoptosis was also accordingly weakened either by
LY294002 or by PD98059 (Fig. 6 panels B and E, supplemental
Fig. 3). Under this circumstance, the luciferase activities driven by
CArG boxes in BCL-2 and MCL-1 promoters were determined.
Transient luciferase assays (Fig.6 panels C and F) showed that
LY29004 or PD98059 partly eliminated baicalin-induced transactivity
of BCL-2 and MCL-1 promoters, respectively. These findings
indicated that PI3K or ERK1/2 signal pathway might contribute to
the anti-apoptotic effect of baicalin via upregulating MRTF-A expression
which thus further activated the transactivity of MCL-1
and BCL-2 promoters.
4. Discussion
Previous studies reported that baicalin could pass through the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) and was detectable in brain dialysate
(Huang et al., 2008). Furthermore, baicalin showed the protective

effects against cerebral ischemia reperfusion damage (Lee and Lee,
2012). Consistent with the previous studies, our data showed that
baicalin directly alleviated neurological deficit and reduced the
infarct volume in vivo. Meanwhile, baicalin efficiently inhibited
neuronal apoptosis and promoted cell viability in vivo and in vitro,
indicating the neuroprotective activity of baicalin on cerebral ischemic
injury.
Cell apoptosis is enhanced through a variety of signal pathways,
and regulated by apoptosis-related genes including BCL-2 family,
caspase, p53, Fas, HSP, IEG and Akt/PKB. Among these genes, BCL-2
family and Bax have a close relationship with cell apoptosis (Orike
et al., 2001). MCL-1 is a pro-survival member of the BCL-2 family
that is initially identified as an immediate-early gene expressed
during differentiation of ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells (Kozopas
et al., 1993). Our study found that baicalin significantly increased
the mRNA or protein levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 in ischemic
hemispheres of MCAO/R rats and in primary cortical neurons. And
interestingly, our data showed that endogenous MRTF-A level was
significant reduced in ischemia hemisphere of cerebral I/R rats, but
markedly increased by baicalin in a dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, using MRTF-A siRNA to knock down MRTF-A efficiently
inhibited the neuroprotective effect of baicalin on primary
cortical neuronal apoptosis, which strengthened the evidence that
MRTF-A involved in the protective effects of baicalin on cerebral
neuronal apoptosis-induced by cerebral I/R.
Previous studies (Kuwahara et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2004;
Wang and Olson, 2004) have indicated that MRTF-A elevates SRF-
driven transcription and enhances its stimulation by brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in primary cortical neurons, which can
regulate SRF and hence contributes to specific gene expression,
including the immediate early genes c-fos, fosB, junB, egr-1 and -2,
nurr1, and nur77, as well as actins and myosins. MRTF-A activates
SRF by binding to it, and this complex drives gene expression,
requiring MRTF-A contacting a definite DNA sequenceflanking the
CArG box (Zaromytidou et al., 2006). Our previous study (Cao
et al., 2011a) has also demonstrated that MRTF-A, as a co-factor of
SRF is necessary for anti-apoptotic gene expression (such as MCL-
1) which plays a vital role in neuronal survival. In vitro primary
cortical neurons, the increasing of BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA and
protein level induced by baicalin was weakened in the case of the
decreasing of endogenous MRTF-A level, providing the further
evidence that the up-regulation of BCL-2 and MCL-1 level induced
by baicalin was associated with MRTF-A.
MRTF-A binds to SRF, and this complex drives gene expression,
which required MRTF-A contacting a definite DNA sequence
flanking CArG box (Zaromytidou et al., 2006). The promoter region
of MCL-1 or BCL-2 contains a confirmed transcription factor
binding sites-CArG boxes. It is hypothesized that baicalin-induced
BCL-2 and MCL-1 expression is partially due to MRTF-A-mediated
the transactivity of BCL-2 and MCL-1 promoter. As expertly, our

data indicated the transactivity of BCL-2 and MCL-1 was activated
by baicalin alone, whiles weakened by co-transfected with MRTFA
siRNA or in the case of mutating the CArG boxes in MCL-1 and
BCL-2 promoter, indicating that baicalin induced transactivity of
MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoters might be through activating the key
CArG box, which was the transcriptional regulatory element
transactivated by MRTF-A..
The signaling pathways of PI3K and ERK1/2 play a key role in
cell growth, proliferation and survival, which promote neuroprotection
via “active” induction of anti-apoptotic genes (Jover-Mengual
et al., 2007). The previous study (Cao et al., 2011a) demonstrates
that PI3K and ERK1/2 activates SRF/SRE-dependent transcription.
In this paper, we found that the inhibition of PI3K and
ERK1/2 pathway reduced baicalin-induced MRTF-A level. At the
meantime, LY294002 or by PD98059, as the inhibitor of PI3K and
ERK1/2 pathway, abolished or decreased baicalin-induced transactivity
of BCL-2 and MCL-1 promoter which was consistent with
baicalin-mediated neuroprotection. These results indicate that
baicalin promoted MRTF-A-mediated transcription and neuronal
survival in PI3K and ERK-dependent manner.
In summary, our data established a molecular mechanism of
baicalin on cerebral ischemia/hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis
via MRTF-A-mediated transactivation in PI3K or ERK1/2-dependent
pathway. We showed that baicalin directly alleviates neurological
deficit and reduces the infarct volume in vivo, and inhibits
ischemia/hypoxia-induced cortex neuronal apoptosis by enhancing
BCL-2 and MCL-1 expression. And MRTF-A level positively
correlates with baicalin neuroptotection, baicalin-induced transactivity
and expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1 via triggering a definite
DNA sequenceflanking CArG boxes in promoters. Futhermore,
the present study also provides the first evidence demonstrating
that the activation of PI3K and ERK1/2 contributed to baicalin
promoting MRTF-A-mediated transcription and neuronal survival.
