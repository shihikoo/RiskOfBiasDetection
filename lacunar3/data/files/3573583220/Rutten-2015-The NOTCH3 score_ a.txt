Abstract
Introduction: CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and
Leukoencephalopathy) is a hereditary small vessel disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, leading
to toxic NOTCH3 protein accumulation in the small- to medium sized arterioles. The accumulation is systemic
but most pronounced in the brain vasculature where it leads to clinical symptoms of recurrent stroke and dementia.
There is no therapy for CADASIL, and therapeutic development is hampered by a lack of feasible clinical outcome
measures and biomarkers, both in mouse models and in CADASIL patients. To facilitate pre-clinical therapeutic
interventions for CADASIL, we aimed to develop a novel, translational CADASIL mouse model.
Results: We generated transgenic mice in which we overexpressed the full length human NOTCH3 gene from a
genomic construct with the archetypal c.544C > T, p.Arg182Cys mutation. The four mutant strains we generated
have respective human NOTCH3 RNA expression levels of 100, 150, 200 and 350 % relative to endogenous mouse
Notch3 RNA expression. Immunohistochemistry on brain sections shows characteristic vascular human NOTCH3
accumulation in all four mutant strains, with human NOTCH3 RNA expression levels correlating with age at onset
and progression of NOTCH3 accumulation. This finding was the basis for developing the ‘NOTCH3 score’,a
quantitative measure for the NOTCH3 accumulation load. This score proved to be a robust and sensitive method to
assess the progression of NOTCH3 accumulation, and a feasible biomarker for pre-clinical therapeutic testing.
Conclusions: This novel, translational CADASIL mouse model is a suitable model for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic
strategies aimed at delaying or reversing NOTCH3 accumulation, using the NOTCH3 score as a biomarker.

Introduction
Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical
Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)
is a hereditary small vessel disease caused by mutations
in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to mid-adult onset stroke
and dementia [1]. CADASIL is characterized by accumulation
of the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3
protein (NOTCH3ECD)inthemediaofsmall-tomediumsized
arterioles [2]. In addition, electron dense deposits
(granular osmiophilic material, GOM) are seen in close
vicinity to the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [3].
The arteriopathy is systemic but most pronounced in the
brain where it leads to degeneration of VSMCs [3] and a
disturbed cerebral blood flow regulation [4]. This causes
recurrent ischemic strokes and cognitive decline, starting
at a mean age of 45–50 years [5]. To date, there is no therapy
to prevent or delay symptoms in CADASIL.
NOTCH3 targeting therapies are in the pre-clinical
phase of development (Rutten et al., unpublished, patent
no. WO 2010085151 A2). The hitherto available
CADASIL mouse models have important limitations
with respect to their feasibility for testing such therapeutic
strategies. Available models include transgenic
models overexpressing human NOTCH3 from a cDNA
construct [6–8] or rat Notch3 from a genomic construct
[9], and models in which a mutation was introduced into
the endogenous Notch3 gene [10, 11]. The first and often
only sign of CADASIL in these models is the presence of
NOTCH3 accumulation in the vasculature [12], and in all
human NOTCH3 transgenic models, the NOTCH3 accumulation
only becomes apparent at a high age [6–8]. Only
the mouse model that expresses mutant rat Notch3 protein
from a genomic DNA construct shows early onset
vascular Notch3 accumulation with subsequent development
of brain parenchymal lesions [9]. However, this
model is less suitable as a translational CADASIL model
due to the species difference, which creates an additional
hurdle in bringing therapeutic compounds to clinical trials.
For example, this would be the case for antisense
therapeutic strategies targeting mutated pre-mRNA, a
therapeutic approach which is being developed for increasing
numbers of CNS disorders [13].
For therapeutic development, feasible clinical outcome
measures and biomarkers are imperative, both in mouse
disease models and in patients. In CADASIL patients,
the variability in age at onset and progression of clinical
symptoms, including the major symptoms of stroke and
cognitive decline, limits their use as an outcome measure
in clinical trials, because of the large number of
patients that would have to be included to detect a treatment
effect within a typical trial-timeframe of 2 years
[14]. White matter lesions, detected on T2 weighted
brain MRI images, are present prior to the onset of clinical
symptoms and correlate with disease severity [15],
but are not a reliable predictor of disease progression
[16]. Changes in magnetic resonance diffusion histograms
are a better predictor of disease progression,
but have only been studied in symptomatic patients
[16, 17]. Ideally, CADASIL therapies would be initiated
in the pre-symptomatic disease phase, i.e. in
young adults with a proven familial NOTCH3 mutation.
Vascular NOTCH3 protein accumulation could
be an interesting therapeutic biomarker for CADASIL,
as increased vascular NOTCH3 staining and GOM
are consistently found in skin arterioles of presymptomatic
patients, decades before onset of stroke
and cognitive decline [18, 19].
In this study, we set out to generate a novel, translational
CADASIL mouse model and to develop a relevant
biomarker in this model. We generated a series of human
NOTCH3 transgenic mouse strains, with various expression
levels of mutant NOTCH3. These mice develop cerebrovascular
NOTCH3 accumulation characteristic of
CADASIL at an early age, and the NOTCH3 expression
level correlates with both the age at onset and progression
of vascular NOTCH3 accumulation. We developed a
quantitative measure for the vascular NOTCH3 accumulation
load, which we show to be a sensitive and robust
biomarker for CADASIL in these mice.
Materials and methods
Generation of NOTCH3 transgenic mice
For transgenesis, a 142,63 kb BAC clone was used
(RP11-456 N16 BAC, Bacpac resources, Oakland, USA)
(Ensemble release 59). The BAC contains the fulllength
human genomic NOTCH3 gene and 44 kb of upstream
and 67 kb of downstream sequence, including
flanking genes SYDE1, ILVBL, EPHX3 and a part of the
BRD4 gene (Fig. 1a). The c.544C > T (p.Arg182Cys)
mutation was introduced using two-step Red-mediated
recombination as previously described [20]. BAC constructs
were injected into fertilized C57BL/6 J Ico oocytes.
Positive transgenic founder mice were identified by
PCR on DNA isolated from mouse ears using human
specific primers (for primer sequences see Additional
file 1: Table S1). The presence of the mutation was confirmed
by direct Sanger sequencing analysis of PCR
products (Fig. 1b). Five transgenic mouse strains were
generated: one carrying the wild-type NOTCH3 transgene
(tgN3WT) and four carrying the mutant NOTCH3
transgene (tgN3MUT). In each strain, integration of the
BAC was confirmed by PCR analysis of NOTCH3 and
the flanking genes SYDE1, ILVBL and EPHX3 (for primer
sequences see Additional file 1: Table S1). All
transgenic mouse strains bred normally. All experiments
described in this study were approved by the
local ethical committee for animal experimentation.

NOTCH3 expression analysis in NOTCH3 transgenic mice
Total RNA was extracted from a brain hemisphere
using RNA-Bee (Tel-test Inc., Friendswood, USA).
For RT-PCR analysis, first-strand cDNA was synthesized
using oligo (dT) primers. RT-PCR analysis was
performed with primers across the human NOTCH3
transcript (exons 2–4, exons 14–16, exons 30–32,
exons 32–33, and the 3′UTR). For qPCR analysis,
cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer
primers, using the Revert Aid H Minus first strand
kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Quantitative
PCR was performed in four 10-week-old male and female
transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates,
using both human- (exons 7–9, 216 bps) and mousespecific
(exons 6–8, 220 bps) primers. Mouse Gapdh
was used as a reference gene, and human NOTCH3
expression levels were calculated relative to endogenous
mouse Notch3 expression levels. A possible effect
of differences in primer efficiencies of human- and
mouse-specific NOTCH3/Notch3 primersets was excluded
by LinregPCR [21].
NOTCH3 immunohistochemistry and quantification in
NOTCH3 transgenic mice
Vascular NOTCH3 accumulation in brain was analysed
prospectively in groups of three mice, at age 4, 6, 12, 24,
52 and 82 weeks. In addition, vascular NOTCH3 accumulation
was assessed in heart, aorta, liver, kidney,
skin and tail at age 20 months. NOTCH3 immunohistochemistry
was performed on cryosections that were
fixated in acetone and incubated overnight with an
antibody directed against the human NOTCH3ECD
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, USA; dilution 1:2000).
The following day, sections were incubated with peroxidase
labelled polymer conjugated to anti-rabbit immunoglobulins
(Envision kit, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and developed
using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Quantification of the
vascular NOTCH3 accumulation load was performed on
brain cryosections. Per time point (6, 24, 52 and 82 weeks),
three tgN3MUT350 mice and three tgN3MUT150 mice were
analysed. For each mouse, four frontal lobe brain sections
were NOTCH3 immunostained simultaneously. Sections
were scanned using the Ultra Fast Scanner (Philips,

Notch3 expression. Endogenous mouse Notch3 expression was comparable between the transgenic mouse strains

Eindhoven, The Netherlands), from which 10 images
representative for the NOTCH3 accumulation observed
in that mouse were obtained. To exclude a possible bias
in image selection, a second, blinded observer was
asked to obtain images independently (Additional file 1:
Figure S1). ImageJ analysis was performed as follows:
the image was converted into an 8-bit image, and filtered
using the unsharp mask filter (radius 1, mask 0.60). Next,
a threshold was set to a signal intensity of 150 to determine
the NOTCH3-positive area. Within the NOTCH3-
positive area, individual NOTCH3 particles were identified
based on size and circularity (size = 0-30, circularity =
0.50-1.00). Finally, the NOTCH3 score was determined by
quantifying the total area of the NOTCH3 positive particles
within the image. The average of the three mice per
time point was plotted and used for further statistical
analysis.
NOTCH3 immunohistochemistry and quantification in
human material
We used paraffin embedded frontal lobe brain sections
from three deceased CADASIL patients (I: female age
59, p.Arg153Cys; II: female age 57, p.Arg153Cys; III:
male age 70, p.Cys446Phe) and three deceased controls
with no known cerebrovascular disorders (I: male age
67, II: male age 58, III: male age 53). Sections were dewaxed

. After heat-induced antigen retrieval in 0.01 M citrate
buffer pH 6, slices were washed three times with
PBS, and incubated overnight at room temperature with
a 1:1 cocktail of anti-NOTCH3ECD (dilution 1:500) and
anti-CD31 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; dilution 1:50).
The following day, sections were washed and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature with a 1:1 cocktail of
anti-rabbit Envision/HRP (Dako) and goat anti-mouse
alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA; dilution 1:25). Finally, sections were sequentially
developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution and
Vector Blue (Vector laboratories). Per individual, four
images were taken at a 400× magnification on a Leica
IM 500 microscope and analysed using ImageJ software.
The vessel area was selected manually based on a positive
CD31 staining. Within the vessel area, the NOTCH3
score was calculated using an intensity threshold of 100.
Electron microscopy in NOTCH3 transgenic mice
Brain tissue was fixed in 1.5 % glutaraldehyde and
1 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer,
post-fixed in a solution of 2 % osmium tetroxide and
2 % potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated and embedded
in epon 812 (LX112). After selection of areas of
interest on 1 μm toluidine stained sections, ultrathin
sections were cut, contrasted with 3 % uranylacetate
and Reynolds lead citrate and examined with a JEOL 
JEM-1011 electron microscope (Advanced Microscopy
Techniques, Woburn, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad
Prism. Differences in NOTCH3 score between the two
mouse strains at a given time point were analysed using
the unpaired student’s t-test. Differences in NOTCH3
score between time points were analysed using One-
Way ANOVA and Fishers least significant difference
post-hoc analysis. Differences in slope (i.e. the rate of increase
of the NOTCH3 score) over time were analysed
using linear regression.
Brain MRI of NOTCH3 transgenic mice
Brain MRI was performed in 15 mice at 20 months of
age; six TgN3MUT350 mice, five tgN3WT mice, and four
non-transgenic littermates. Mice were anesthetised by
inhalation of 2 % isoflurane in a 1:1 mixture of oxygen
and air. Respiration rate was monitored with a respiratory
pad and kept between 50 and 80 respirations per
minute by adjusting the isoflurane concentration. T2
weighted imaging was performed on a 7 Tesla Bruker
Pharmascan using a 23 mm quadrature coil with the
following parameters: TE = 12 ms, RARE factor = 8, effective
TE = 48 ms, TR = 4 s, 8 averages. Field-of-view =
19x19 mm, matrix = 196x196, resulting in an in-plane
resolution of 97 μm. Slice thickness = 0.5 mm, with 32
slices.
Analysis of brain parenchyma in NOTCH3 transgenic
mice
After MRI, anesthetised mice were sacrificed using cardial
perfusion with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline.
One brain hemisphere was formalin fixated and paraffin
embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) to analyse the presence of infarctions, with
Kluver Barrera Luxol fast blue to visualise myelin and
with Perl’s iron to assess the presence of microbleeds.
Astrogliosis was analysed using an anti-glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (rabbit anti-GFAP,
Dako; dilution 1:1000), which was incubated overnight
at room temperature. As a secondary antibody, biotin
labelled swine-anti Rabbit (Dako; dilution 1:600) was
used, this was incubated 1 hour at room temperature.
Finally, sections were incubated with avidin-biotin
complex (Vectastain ABC-Elite Kit, Vector Lab, Burlingame
, USA) for 30 minutes at room temperature and
developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution. The detection
of macrophages and myelin was performed
using the Animal Research Kit peroxidase (Dako). Biotinylated
primary antibodies against CD68 (anti-CD68
clone KP-1, Dako; dilution 1:1000) and myelin proteolipid
protein (anti-PLP, clone plpc-1, Serotec, Kidlington,

UK; dilution 1:500) were incubated overnight after
heat-induced antigen retrieval in 0.01 M EDTA pH 8.0.
The following day, sections were incubated with HRP-
conjugated streptavidin for 30 minutes at room
temperature and developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
solution.
Results
Four mutant human NOTCH3 transgenic mouse strains
with distinct NOTCH3 expression levels
Using qPCR analysis on RNA isolated from brain of 10-
week old mice, we found that the four mutant NOTCH3
p.Arg182Cys transgenic mouse strains (tgN3MUT) had
human NOTCH3 expression levels of 100, 150, 200 and
350 %, respectively, compared to endogenous mouse
Notch3 expression (Fig. 1c). Human NOTCH3 expression
in the lowest expressing tgN3MUT strain, was comparable
to that in the wild-type strain (tgN3WT), i.e.
~100 %. RT-PCR analysis with multiple NOTCH3 primer
sets spanning the complete transcript, showed that the
complete human NOTCH3 cDNA was present in the
transgenic transcript (Additional file 1: Figure S2). There
was no difference in endogenous mouse Notch3 expression
between transgenic and non-transgenic mice
(Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Age at onset of vascular NOTCH3 protein accumulation
correlates with NOTCH3 expression levels
To analyse the presence and onset of a CADASIL vascular
phenotype, NOTCH3 immunohistochemistry was
performed on brain slices from mice between the ages of
4 weeks and 20 months. This showed that all tgN3MUT
strains developed cerebrovascular NOTCH3 accumulation
, as seen by a positive, granular NOTCH3 staining of
the vessel wall (Fig. 2a), similar to that which is seen in
CADASIL patients (Fig. 2b). There was a considerable
difference in age at onset of positive NOTCH3 staining
per mouse strain, ranging from 6 weeks in tgN3MUT350
mice to 12 months in tgN3MUT100 mice. The age at onset
directly correlated with the level of human NOTCH3
RNA expression for all four tgN3MUT strains i.e. the
higher the NOTCH3 RNA expression level, the earlier
the onset of NOTCH3 accumulation (Table 1). Furthermore
, in each mutant strain, the positive NOTCH3 immunostaining
became progressively more intense and
granular with age (Fig. 2a). The individual granular
NOTCH3 deposits increased not only in number, but
also in size. This was most prominent in mice with the
highest NOTCH3 RNA expression level (tgN3MUT350),
in which the NOTCH3 protein accumulation progressively
evolved to a vessel wall packed with intense and
big granular NOTCH3 deposits at age 20 months. Characteristic
granular NOTCH3 staining was also present in
arterioles of the heart, liver, kidney, skin and tail, but not
in the aorta (Fig. 2c, data not shown). Overall, the
NOTCH3 accumulation observed in the extra-cerebral
arterioles was less pronounced than in the brain.
Electron microscopy of brain arterioles revealed characteristic
electron dense deposits within the basement
membrane (Fig. 2d) reminiscent of GOM deposits
seen in CADASIL patients (Fig. 2e). Neither GOM
nor increased cerebrovascular NOTCH3 staining was
found in tgN3WT mice at 20 months of age (Fig. 2a).
Taken together, these analyses show that transgenic
human NOTCH3 p.Arg182Cys mice develop an early
and progressive systemic arteriopathy which closely
resembles the vascular pathology seen in CADASIL
patients, with age-at-onset correlating with the respective
levels of mutant human NOTCH3 expression.
Development of the NOTCH3 score, a quantitative
biomarker for CADASIL
As we observed such an early and clear age- and
NOTCH3 expression level- dependent vascular NOTCH3
accumulation load, we set out to objectify this by developing
a quantitative measure for NOTCH3 staining. This
was accomplished by capturing and measuring the surface
area of CADASIL specific granular NOTCH3 deposits
within brain sections using ImageJ software (Fig. 3a),
which we called the ‘NOTCH3 score’. This quantification
was first performed in tgN3MUT350 mice, which
clearly showed that the NOTCH3 score increased
with age, confirming our qualitative observations
(Fig. 3b). Next, we validated the NOTCH3 score in a 
second mouse strain, tgN3MUT150, in which the same
age-dependent increase in the NOTCH3 score was
seen. At each time-point, the NOTCH3 score was
lower for the tgN3MUT150 mice compared to the
tgN3MUT350 mice, reflecting the correlation between
NOTCH3 expression level and NOTCH3 accumulation
load (score at age 20 months: 659 ± 51 vs. 1150
± 107, p= 0.002) (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, progression of
NOTCH3 accumulation was slower in tgN3MUT150
mice compared to tgN3MUT350 mice, as shown by a
significant difference in the slope of the NOTCH3
scores between the two mouse strains (11.1 ± 0.5 vs.
6.2 ± 0.3, p= 0.002). Finally, we tested the approach in
brain sections of three unrelated CADASIL patients.
Measurement of the NOTCH3 accumulation load
using the NOTCH3 score was technically feasible in
human tissue (Fig. 3d) and showed a significantly
higher NOTCH3 score in patients than in controls
(score 3.81 ± 1.85 vs. 0.24 ± 0.17, p= 0.02) (Fig. 3e).
No clear brain parenchyma phenotype in tgN3MUT mice
Finally, to determine whether we could correlate the
NOTCH3 score to a brain phenotype in tgN3MUT mice,
we performed brain MRI and histopathology in mice

aged 20 months (Additional file 1, Figure S4, S5). In
two of the six tgN3MUT350 mice, hyperintensities
were seen on T2 weighted images, cranial to the corpus
callosum and around the ventricles in the frontal
lobe. However, similar hyperintensities were found in one
non-transgenic littermate. Histopathological examination
did not show any signs of astrogliosis or white matter lesions
in the mutant mice. The absence of consistent and
specific brain abnormalities in tgN3MUT mice prohibited
the testing of a potential correlation between NOTCH3
score and brain phenotype.
Discussion
To facilitate the testing of pre-clinical therapeutic interventions
for CADASIL, we generated a translational
, human genomic NOTCH3 transgenic mouse
model with an early vascular phenotype, and developed
a biomarker in this model. The mutant mice recapitulate
the CADASIL vascular phenotype with early
onset and progressive cerebrovascular NOTCH3 accumulation
and GOM deposits in arterioles. The respective
NOTCH3 RNA expression levels in the four mutant
mouse strains correlate strongly and consistently with the
age at onset and progression of NOTCH3 protein accumulation
, with the highest expressing mouse strain developing
vascular NOTCH3 accumulation as early as
6 weeks of age. The quantitative biomarker we developed,
the NOTCH3 score, allows for a sensitive and objective
measure of NOTCH3 accumulation, which can therefore
be used for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic strategies
aimed at delaying or reversing NOTCH3 accumulation.
Cerebrovascular NOTCH3 accumulation was selected
as a potential biomarker because it was consistently
and specifically found in tgN3MUT mice, and
showed an early age at onset and clear progression.
Also, NOTCH3 accumulation is a plausible surrogate
marker for CADASIL because it is universally present
in the cerebrovasculature of CADASIL patients and is believed
to play an important role in disease pathophysiology
[22]. Because of the lack of consistent brain abnormalities
in our mice, we were unable to correlate the NOTCH3
score to a brain phenotype. However, an early age at onset
of NOTCH3 accumulation has previously been found to
be associated with the development of brain parenchymal
damage in mice [9]. Moreover, age is one of the most important
predictors of CADASIL disease severity and progression
[14, 23], implicating that the age-dependent
increase in NOTCH3 score is a relevant surrogate marker
for disease progression. Sample size calculations we performed
show that the NOTCH3 score is a feasible biomarker
for pre-clinical therapeutic studies, as an effect on
NOTCH3 accumulation can be assessed in relatively small
groups of mice. For example, treatment of 7 mice allows
for the detection of a 50 % effect on the progression of the
NOTCH3 score, when treating from 6 to 24 weeks of age.
We found that the NOTCH3 score can also be measured
in the cerebrovasculature of deceased CADASIL
patients. Evidently, a NOTCH3 score in brain sections is

pattern in the brain vasculature. TgN3WT mice showed only a weak, diffuse NOTCH3 staining pattern, which did not increase with age
(comparable to non-transgenic litter-mates, data not shown). The NOTCH3 accumulation load in the tgN3MUT strains correlates well with
the NOTCH3 expression level and increases with age; in tgN3MUT350 mice, first granular staining is already visible at 6 weeks of age; at
20 months of age nearly the whole vessel wall is packed with big granular NOTCH3 deposits. In the strains with a lower NOTCH3 expression level, the
NOTCH3 accumulation starts at a later age and the granular deposits remain smaller. b Positive NOTCH3 staining in a brain vessel of a CADASIL patient.

not a feasible biomarker in clinical trials. However, vascular
NOTCH3 accumulation has been extensively demonstrated
in skin biopsies of CADASIL patients and is
detectable decades before the onset of clinical symptoms
[18, 19]. In a single family study, an age-dependent increase
in GOM deposits in skin biopsies was found up
to 50 years of age [24]. Although previous studies did
not find a correlation between skin biopsy NOTCH3 immunostaining
and disease severity, these studies were
limited by a qualitative assessment of the NOTCH3
staining intensity [18, 19]. Whether such a correlation
can be established using our quantitative NOTCH3 score,
will have to be assessed in future prospective studies.
This novel CADASIL mouse model is especially suitable
for testing therapeutic strategies for a number of
reasons. The presence of the human NOTCH3 gene in
our mouse model allows for testing compounds specifically
directed at human NOTCH3, thereby avoiding an
additional hurdle in the translation from pre-clinical to
clinical trials. The fact that we used a genomic NOTCH3
construct allows for testing therapeutic interventions
that target mutant NOTCH3 at the genomic or (pre-)
Fig. 3 Quantitative analysis of vascular NOTCH3 protein accumulation in transgenic human NOTCH3 p.Arg182Cys mice and in brain tissue of
CADASIL patients. a ImageJ processing of NOTCH3-immunostained brain sections of tgN3MUT350 mice. The images were filtered to reduce
background signal and a standardised threshold was applied to determine the NOTCH3- positive area composed of individual granular NOTCH3
deposits, resulting in the NOTCH3 score. b Quantitative analysis of NOTCH3 accumulation in tgN3MUT350 mice. The NOTCH3 score shows
an age-dependent increase and allows for a sensitive discrimination between age groups (One-Way ANOVA, Fishers least significant difference).
c Validation of the NOTCH3 score in tgN3MUT150 mice, also showing an age-dependent increase. At each time point, the score is lower in tgN3MUT150
than in tgN3MUT350 mice (unpaired t-test), reflecting the correlation between NOTCH3 RNA expression and NOTCH3 protein accumulation.
Data represent the average +/− SD of the three mice analysed per time point. d ImageJ analysis of human brain sections double stained
with NOTCH3 and CD31. The vessel area was selected based on the staining with the endothelial cell marker CD31, and within this area,
the NOTCH3 score was determined. e CADASIL patients show a significantly higher NOTCH3 score than age-matched controls. (unpaired
t-test) Data represent the average +/− SD of three CADASIL patients and three control individuals

mRNA level. Such interventions, for example using
antisense oligonucleotides to reduce or modify mutant
NOTCH3 protein, are being developed in our lab (Rutten
et al., unpublished, patent no. WO 2010085151 A2).
Another practical advantage is that in this early onset
model, treatment can be initiated at an early age.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a novel, unique human
NOTCH3 transgenic mouse model and a NOTCH3 score
which is a robust and sensitive biomarker for CADASIL.
This translational model is ideally suited for pre-clinical
testing of therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying or reversing
NOTCH3 protein accumulation.
