Focal brain ischemia in adult rats rapidly and robustly induces neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ)
but there are few and inconsistent reports in mice, presenting a hurdle to genetically investigate the endogenous
neurogenic regulators such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Here, wefirst provide a platform for
further studies by showing that middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male C57BL/6 mice robustly enhances
neurogenesis in the SVZ only under very specific conditions, i.e., 14 days after a 30 min occlusion.
CNTF expression paralleled changes in the number of proliferated, BrdU-positive, SVZ cells. Stroke-induced
proliferation was absent in CNTF−/− mice, suggesting that it is mediated by CNTF. MCAO-increased CNTF
appears to act on C cell proliferation and by inducing FGF2 expression but not via EGF expression or
Notch1 signaling of neural stem cells in the SVZ. CNTF is unique, as expression of other gp130 ligands, IL-6
and LIF, did not predict SVZ proliferation or showed no or only small compensatory increases in CNTF−/−
mice. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, which can inhibit neurogenesis, and the presence of leukocytes
in the SVZ were inversely correlated with neurogenesis, but pro-inflammatory cytokines did not affect CNTF
expression in cultured astrocytes. These results suggest that slowly up-regulated CNTF in the SVZ mediates
stroke-induced neurogenesis and is counteracted by inflammation. Further pharmacological stimulation of
endogenous CNTF might be a good therapeutic strategy for cell replacement after stroke as CNTF regulates
normal patterns of neurogenesis and is expressed almost exclusively in the nervous system.

Introduction
It is well-known that focal cerebral and striatal ischemia enhances
neurogenesis in the SVZ and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus
(Burns et al., 2009; Kernie and Parent, 2010; Zhang and Chopp, 2009).
Many studies have shown that ischemic injury induced by MCAO in
adult rats increases the number of proliferating SVZ cells (Arvidsson
et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2001; Parent et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2001).
Stroke-induced neurogenesis also seems to occur in the human brain
(Jin et al., 2006; Macas et al., 2006). These results have raised the possibility
that new neurons formed by endogenous neural stem cells can be
used to replace cells as a treatment for stroke. A better understanding of
the molecular regulatorsofstroke-induced neurogenesis and identification
of endogenous drug targets to promote neurogenesis would be facilitated
by the use of transgenic and knockout mice. However, in
contrast to rats, it is not clear under which conditions stroke induced
by MCAO in mice enhances SVZ neurogenesis. Only a few papers have
reported changes in the SVZ of mice with one showing decreases at
3 days after MCAO and a return to baseline at 7 days (Tsai et al.,
2006) and another an approximately 50% increase at 14 days after a
permanent cortically restricted stroke (Wang et al., 2007). Some of
the reasons for these apparent discrepancies and the differences between
rats and mice might include mouse-specific requirements for
the occlusion and post-injury times, or technical issues in the much
smaller mouse.
Injured cells release many cytokines and growth factors after ischemia
, which may be responsible for the neurogenic responses to
stroke. Treatment with exogenous growth factors such as FGF2,
EGF, BDNF, VEGF, EPO, CNTF and IGF-1 have been shown to promote
ischemia-induced neurogenesis, predominantly in rats (Chmielnicki

et al., 2004; Esneault et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2004; Schabitz et al., 2007;
Sun et al., 2003; Tureyen et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Yan et al.,
2006; Yang et al., 2008). Of these, IGF-1 (Yan et al., 2006)andCNTF
have been confirmed to regulate a proportion of endogenous
neurogenesis under normal conditions using knockout mice or antibodies
(Yang et al., 2008). However, only IGF-1 has been shown, by antibody
knock-down, to be involved in the response after stroke (Yan et
al., 2006), reiterating the need for using more genetic mouse models.
CNTF is of particular interest as it is up‐regulated in the ischemic cortex
nearly 20 fold by 2 weeks after stroke (Lin et al., 1998), enhances normal
adult SVZ neurogenesis in mice and can be increased through systemic
D2 dopamine agonist injections (Emsley and Hagg, 2003; Yang
et al., 2008). Thus, CNTF might be a good therapeutic target for stroke
but its role in stroke-induced neurogenesis remains to be investigated.
Some of the cytokines produced during the inflammatory response
after stroke, such as IL-6, TNFα, and IFNγ, have anti-proliferative effects
in the SVZ and hippocampal subgranular zone (Ben-Hur et al., 2003;
Iosif et al., 2006, 2008; Monje et al., 2003; Vallieres et al., 2002). The interactions
between pro- and anti-neurogenic cytokines remain to be investigated
and would be facilitated by using genetically altered mice.
The present study was aimed at investigating under which conditions
reproducible MCAO in mice would enhance SVZ neurogenesis,
providing a platform to determine whether and how endogenous
CNTF regulates this stroke-induced neurogenesis.
Materials and methods
Experimental animals
A total of 176 male C57BL/6 (12 weeks of age; 24–30 g; stock#
000664, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and 80 female and
male CNTF knockout mice (VG#199 in (Valenzuela et al., 2003))
and their heterozygous and wildtype littermates were used. The latter
were age- and gender-matched to provide equal representation
in each experimental group. Genotyping of tail snips was performed
with the Velocigene genotyping protocol provided by Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals who produced the mice. These mice were originally
on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129Sv background and have been backcrossed
into C57BL/6 for 5 times since we received them. All procedures and
animal care were carried out according to the protocols and guidelines
of the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health.
Care and use of experimental animals
Deep anesthesia for all invasive procedures was achieved by an intraperitoneal
injection of Avertin (0.4 mg 2,2,2-tribromoethanol in
0.02 ml of 1.25% 2-methyl-2-butanolin saline per gram body weight;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Post-surgical care included injection of
1.5 μg buprenorphine in 0.1 ml saline (1:20 dilution of 0.3 mg/ml
stock solution; Ben Venue Laboratories, OH) subcutaneously once the
mice recovered from anesthesia to prevent fatal interaction with
Avertin, followed by injections every 12 h for a total of 4 injections.
Gentamicin (20 μgin100μl saline; 1:200 dilution of a 40 mg/ml stock
solution; ButlerSchein, Dublin, OH) was injected subcutaneously during
surgery, as well as 2 and 4 days post-surgery.
Over the course of developing the consistent MCAO in mice and the
effects on SVZ neurogenesis we used different occlusion times, including
15, 30 or 45 min. The neurological deficits caused by the 30 and
45 min MCAO required special and intensive care of the mice. Thus,
mice were weighed daily and any lost weight was replaced by a subcutaneous
injection of an equal amount of Ringer's lactate–dextrose solution.
They also were provided with a hydration gel-pack and peanut
butter cookies placed on the bedding, in addition to their regular
water bottle and chow.
Reproducible mouse MCAO model of focal ischemia
Focal cerebral and striatal ischemia was induced by MCAO for various
occlusion times followed by reperfusion. After the mice were anesthetized
, a needle probe of a Laser-Doppler Flowmetry device (Moor
VMS-LDF, VP10M200ST, P10d, Moor Instruments Ltd., Wilmington,
DE) was glued onto the superior portion of the temporal bone to monitor
cerebral bloodflow. After a midline skin incision in the neck area,
with the mouse in the supine position, the left external carotid artery
(ECA) was exposed and isolated from its small artery branches with a
bipolar coagulator (N.S. 237, Codman & Shurtleff, Inc., Randolph, MA).
The ECA was ligated with 5–0 silk suture approximately 3 mm distal
to its origin. Microvascular clips were temporarily placed on the common
carotid artery and the internal carotid artery, and then an
arteriotomy was made in the ECA. Next, a filament was inserted into
the ECA and advanced over 8–9 mm to the carotid bifurcation along
the internalcarotidartery and to the origin of the middle cerebralartery
(MCA). We tested different types of filaments (Supplemental results)
andthe resultsinthemain textwere with themostreliable 0.21 mmdiameter
DOCCOLfilaments (6021PK5Re, DOCCOL Co, Redlands, CA). Cerebral
blood flow decreases immediately after a successful MCAO to
about 20% of baseline and was used to confirm the correct placement
of the filament. After 15, 30 or 45 min the filament was removed to
restore blood flow of the MCA territory, which includes the striatum
and overlying cortex, and the microvascular clips were removed.
Sham‐operated mice received the same surgery except for the insertion
of thefilament. Core body temperature was maintained at 37.0±0.5 °C
with a heating pad during the operation and the recovery period. The
wound was closed in layers using silk and metal sutures.
Immunocytochemistry
BrdU (50 mg/kg per injection; Sigma B5002) was injected intraperitoneally
twice a day during the 3 days before perfusion. Sixteen hours
after the last BrdU injection, the mice were perfused transcardially with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M, pH 7.4). Afterwards, the
brains were fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected
in 30% sucrose in PB for 24 h. Coronal 30μm thick sections through
the brains were cut on a sliding freezing microtome (Leica SM 2000R,
Bannockburn, IL). Starting at a random point along the rostrocaudal
axis of the brain, every sixth section through the SVZ was immunostained
for BrdU (MAB3510, mouse IgG, clone BU-1, 1:30,000;
Millipore, Billerica, MA). Briefly, sections were incubated in 50% formamide
in 2× SSC at 65 °C for 2 h, rinsed in fresh 2× SSC, incubated in
2 N HCl at 37 °C for 30 min, and neutralized in 0.1 M boric acid, pH
8.5, for 10 min. This was followed by incubation in 5% normal horse
serum for 1 h to block non-specific staining, in primary antibodies overnight
, biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:800; BA2001, Vector Laboratories
, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, all dissolved in PBS containing 5%
horse serum. This was followed by an incubation in avidin–biotin complex
conjugated with peroxidase for 1 h (1:600 in PBS, PK6100, Vector
Laboratories). Chromogen reaction was performed with 0.04%
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (D5637,Sigma) solution containing 0.06% nickel
ammonium sulfate and 1% hydrogen peroxidein 0.05 M Tris buffer–HCl
(TBS). Sections were then rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, mounted
on glass slides, and coverslipped with Permount (SP15, Fisher Scientific,
Fair Lawn, NJ). To detect neuroblasts, three sections throughout the SVZ
were stained for double-fluorescence with BrdU and their marker
doublecortin (dcx). Therefore, sections were incubated in 2 N HCl for
1 h at room temperature, neutralized in 0.1 M boric acid, pH 8.5, for
10 min, and followed by washing overnight in 0.1 M TBS at 4 °C. Sections
were incubated with 5% donkey serum in TBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 30 min at room temperature followed by an overnight
incubation at 4 °C in TBS containing 5% donkey serum, goat anti-DCX
(1:500, SC8066, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse

anti-BrdU (1:5000, MAB3510, Millipore, Billerica, MA). They were incubated
in TBS containing 5% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, fluorescent
donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluor
594, A21203, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and donkey anti-goat IgG secondary
antibodies (1:500, Alexa Fluor 488, A11055, Invitrogen, Carlsbad
, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed and then
coverslipped with antifade Gel/Mount aqueous mounting media
(Southernbiotech, Birmingham, AL). In between steps, the sections
were washed 3 times for 10 min in TBS.
For CD45 staining, sections were incubated with 5% donkey
serum in PBS (to block non-specific staining) containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 1 h at room temperature followed by an overnight incubation
at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% donkey serum and rat anti-CD45
(1:500, CBL1326, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Next, sections were incubated
in PBS containing 5% donkey serum andfluorescent donkey anti-rat
IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Alexa Fluor 594, A21209, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, and coverslipped with
antifade Gel/Mount aqueous mounting media (Southernbiotech,
Birmingham, AL). In between steps, the sections were washed 3 times
for 10 min in PBS.
Unbiased stereological counting and statistical analysis
The number of BrdU-positive nuclei in the SVZ was counted in all
mice by the same person who was blinded to the treatment using an
unbiased optical fractionator stereological method (Stereologer; Systems
Planning and Analysis, Alexandria, VA) (Baker et al., 2004)anda
motorized Leica DMIRE2 microscope. The reference space was defined
as a 50-μm-widestrip of the entire lateral wall of the lateral ventricle ipsilateral
to the MCAO or sham operation and rostrocaudally from the
genu of the corpus callosum to the caudal end of the decussation of
the anterior commissure. Frame size was 2000μm2and frame spacing
was 75 μm. BrdU-positive nuclei were counted in software-defined
frames placed within the reference space. The total number of
BrdU-positive nuclei was calculated by the software as: n=numberof
nuclei counted×1/section sampling fraction×1/area sampling fraction
×1/thickness sampling fraction. In addition, the number of events
in each section was derived from the data files to determine whether
there might be rostrocaudal differences in the responses to the MCAO.
The number of neuroblasts was counted using a 20× objective by identifying
dcx-positive cells with BrdU-labeled nuclei in the most populace
dorsolateral part of the SVZ and compared to the total number of
BrdU-labeled nuclei in the same counting area. Statistical analyses
were performed with Student'sttest with a value ofpb0.05 considered
as statistically significant.
Real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR)
After 5 or 12 days, i.e., during the time when BrdU was injected
in other groups, mice were processed to measure CNTF expression
in the SVZ. The brains were collected fresh and cut in the coronal
plane into 1 mm slices using single sided razor blades and
0.5 mm wide SVZ strips freshly dissected from between the genu
and the anterior commissure decussation. Total RNA was isolated
using a commercial kit (74104, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and was
used as templates in reverse transcription (RT), which runs with
1.0 μl total RNA (1.0 μg), 1.0 μl of 500ng/ μl random primers 
(C118A, Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA), 1.25 μlof10mMdNTPmix
(U151A, Promega), 5 μl 5× RT buffer, 1.75 μl RNase-free water, 
and 1 μl of 200 U/μl MMLV-RT(M170A, Promega). RT reactions
were performed at 70°C for 5min and 37°C for 1h. QPCR was
performed using specific primer sets (CNTF: mM0046373_m1

FAM, Hes5: Mm00439311_g1 FAM, and GAPDH: 4352339E VIC, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RT reactions were performed at
37 °C for 1 h. PCR reactions were performed using the TaqMan®
Gene Expression Master Mix kits (4369016, Applied Biosystems)
as follows: 10 min at 95° followed by 40 cycles of 95° for 15 s,
60° for 1 min in an ABI 7900 ThermalCycler (Applied Biosystems).
After qPCR, the numbers of cycles for the gene (e.g., CNTF) fragment
were subtracted from (normalized to) that for the GAPDH
fragment to calculate the relative abundance of the specific
mRNA. We used the 2−ΔΔCtmethod to calculate changes compared
to sham‐operated mice.
Results
Only 30 min MCAO causes robust increases in SVZ proliferation in adult
mice
We first determined that commercially available intraluminal
DOCCOLfilaments provided reliable injuries in C57BL/6 mice compared
to the unreliable results with often-used heat expanded sutures (Supplemental
results). We had next tested the potential effects of endogenous
CNTF on neurogenesis induced by a 15 min MCAO with the
DOCCOL sutures, but surprisingly detected no increase in wildtype,
CNTF+/−, or CNTF−/− littermates at 7 days (Supplemental results).
In view of the negative data, we increased the occlusion time and
post-injury time using standard male C57BL/6 mice. The 30 min occlusion
caused damage in a large part of the neighboring striatum, but no
infarct of the SVZ unlike the 45 min occlusion (Fig. 1). Sections stained
for BrdU 14 days post-injury showed a lack of an overt neurogenic response
compared to sham-operated mice (Fig. 2a) after the 15
(Fig. 2b) and 45 min MCAO (Fig. 2d) but a robust response after the
30 min MCAO (Fig. 2c). The number of SVZ BrdU+ nuclei was not significantly affected by the 15 min MCAO at 7 days (MCAO: 30,298±
1,521 versus sham: 30,747±2,310; Fig. 3a) but had increased by 19%
at 14 days post-injury (MCAO: 34,585±1,535 versus sham: 29,094±
2,912, pb0.05). After a 30 min MCAO, the number of BrdU+ nuclei in
the SVZ increased by 23±0.6% over sham at 7 days (pb0.05) and increased
close to 2-fold at 14 days post-injury (95±2% over sham;
pb0.01). After a 45 min MCAO, the number of BrdU+ nuclei in the
SVZ was unchanged at 7 days post-injury (97±11% of sham; p=
0.41). Combined with thefinding of ischemic lesions affecting the SVZ
after the 45 min MCAO, this suggests that injury to the SVZ reduces its
responsiveness. Due to high mortality, we were unable to obtain results
14 days after a 45 min MCAO. The results so far show that MCAO induces
robust proliferation in the SVZ of adult mice only with a consistentfilament size and under very specificconditions.
Stroke increases C cell proliferation in the SVZ
To obtain a better insight into the type of proliferating SVZ cells, we
used qPCR on the SVZ tissue of a new set of mice 12 days following a
30 min MCAO. This time point was chosen to be within the time
when BrdU had been injected in the previous experimental mouse
groups. Expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (Wojtowicz and
Kee, 2006) was significantly increased by 77% compared to sham values
(Fig. 3b), consistent with the increase in BrdU(Fig. 3a). Within the same
tissue, PCNA, which has been used to detect proliferating SVZ cells by
immunocytochemistry, was not significantly changed (Fig. 3b; p=
0.366). This might be caused by low levels of PCNA expression in
every cell, including the more numerous striatal cells included in the
dissected tissue. The stroke-induced proliferation did not appear to be
mediated by increased self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) as expression
of their marker Sox2 (Ellis et al., 2004) was not increased
70 S.S. Kang et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 49 (2013) 68–78
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.519717983)
(Fig. 3b; p=0.662). Musashi-1, a marker for SVZ stem and progenitor
cells (Kaneko et al., 2000), was increased by 33% (Fig. 3b). Most of the
proliferation was likely due to the transient amplifying C cell progenitor
population as their marker EGFR (Doetsch et al., 2002) was increased
close to 4-fold (Fig. 3b).
Stroke increases neurogenesis in the SVZ
Under normal conditions the C cells predominantly produce
neuroblasts. We determined whether the stroke-induced proliferation
also resulted in more neuroblasts or not, using 14 day 30 min MCAO
mice which had shown an increase in SVZ proliferation. Confocal
z-stack images of the most populace dorsolateral region of the SVZ
showed a clear stroke-induced increase in dcx staining (Fig. 4b) as compared
to sham-operated mice (Fig. 4a). The total number of BrdU nuclei
also appeared to be increased. Counts of the number of BrdU+ nuclei
and the total number of dcx/BrdU+ neuroblasts showed that both
were increased after stoke (by 42 and 93%, respectively, compared to
sham,pb0.01,pb0.005;Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the number of additional
neuroblasts (dcx) wasnot significantlydifferent from thenumberof additional
BrdU+ nuclei following stroke (65±11 vs. 90±23; p=0.14
pairedttest). This suggests that most of the SVZ C cells that proliferated
in response to the stroke produced neuroblasts.
Stroke increases CNTF expression in the SVZ
Our objective in this study was to determine the contribution of endogenous
CNTF to stroke-induced neurogenesis. The differences in the
neurogenic responses seen after 15 vs. 30 min at 14 day post-MCAO
times provided an opportunity to correlate them with CNTF expression
levels. In C57BL/6 mice with a 15 min MCAO, CNTF expression in the
SVZ was increased by 23% at 12 days (1.23±0.08 fold versus sham:
1.00±0.06; n=6 each, pb0.05; Fig. 5b), consistent with the small increase
in proliferation (Fig. 3a). After the 30 min MCAO, when a clear
increase in neurogenesis was observed (Figs. 3aand5a), CNTF expression
was increased by more than 4-fold at 12 days post-injury (4.62±
0.54, versus sham: 1.00±0.05, n=6 and 9, pb0.000001). These data
suggests that CNTF could mediate or be involved in stroke-induced
neurogenesis.
Lack of CNTF greatly reduces the stroke-induced neurogenic response
To confirm the role of CNTF in stroke-induced neurogenesis, 
CNTF−/−mice were injured by a 30 min MCAO and compared to their
littermates. All genotypes showed a similar extent of injury (Fig. 6band
c). The control littermates showed an apparent increase in SVZ proliferation
as shown by BrdU incorporation, whereas the CNTF−/− mice
seemed to lack this response (Fig. 6e and f compared to sham, Fig. 6d).
The number of BrdU+ SVZ cells in wildtype CNTF mice was significantly
increased by about 47±13% compared to that of sham‐operated mice
(+/+ MCAO: 37,140±3,312 versus +/+ sham: 25,297±4,021;
pb0.05;Fig. 7a). The number of BrdU+ SVZ nuclei in CNTF +/−was increased
by 52±14% (pb0.05) but CNTF−/−mice showed no significant
increase (18±10%, p=0.185) after MCAO compared to the sham values
of the individual genotypes. The BrdU values for the heterozygous mice
were significantly greater than that of the CNTF−/− mice (pb0.05;
Fig. 7a). There were no significant differences between genders in any
of the genotypes in either sham-operated or MCAO mice (data not
shown). The response to MCAO by the CNTF−/− micewaslessthan
30–40% (although not significant compared to sham) of that seen in
their littermates, suggesting that 60–70% or more of the increased SVZ
neurogenesis is mediated by CNTF.
Like CNTF, LIF and IL-6 activate the gp130 receptor, which is involved
in stimulating NSC renewal in the adult SVZ (Chojnacki et al.,
2003). Others have found that LIF can compensate for the lack of CNTF
in null mice in the eye (Kirsch et al., 2010). Our data comparing
CNTF−/− and littermates show that LIF and IL-6 do not compensate
under sham-operated (normal) conditions (Supplemental results). At
12 days following a 30 min MCAO, the CNTF−/− mice had a 40–50%
larger increase in LIF than their control littermates, which is much less
than the 5–11 fold increase in CNTF seen in the same littermates (Supplemental
Fig. 1). This suggests that compensation by LIF, if it occurs, is
small. IL-6 values were not significantly different between CNTF−/−
and CNTF+/+ or CNTF+/−littermates.
MCAO-increased CNTF induces FGF2 expression in the SVZ
To find potential proliferation-inducing mechanisms in the SVZ
downstream of CNTF following stroke, we measured the expression
levels of EGF, FGF2, and the Notch1 pathway, all major contributors to
SVZ neurogenesis (Chojnacki et al., 2003; Kuhn et al., 1997; Zheng et
al., 2004). Under sham conditions, EGF mRNA expression levels in the
SVZ as measured by the deltaCT values were only approximately 10%
of those of FGF2 (data not shown). FGF2, but not EGF, expression increased
significantly at 12 days after a 30 min MCAO in wildtype mice
(Fig. 7b). This increase in FGF2 was not seen in CNTF−/− mice
(Fig. 7b), suggesting that the MCAO-induced CNTF causes the increase
in FGF2 expression in wildtype mice. Notch1 expression was increased
by the MCAO in both genotypes (Fig. 7b), suggesting that CNTF does not
regulate Notch1 expression under these conditions. MCAO-increased

at 7 days after MCAO in C57BL/6 mice can be seen by the loss of neurons in cresyl violet

indicated by a stippled line) after (d) 15 min or (e) 30 min MCAO, whereas (f) a 45 min
occlusion induced ischemic damage to the SVZ. Scale bar, 500 μm.

Mash1 expression was also not significantly different between the
CNTF−/− and wildtype SVZ (Fig. 7b). The Notch1 ligand, Delta3,
which is downstream of Mash1 (Chojnacki et al., 2003), was not significantly
affected by the MCAO in either genotype (Fig. 7b). Expression of
Hes1 and Hes5, which are also regulated by Notch1 (Chojnacki et al.,
2003), was not significantly affected by the MCAO in either CNTF−/−
or wildtype mice (Fig. 7b).
Negative regulators of stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis counteract CNTF
activity
A time course analysis of CNTF expression showed that it was already
increased 3-fold by day 5 after MCAO (Fig. 8a). However, the
SVZ proliferation was only increased by ~20%, as measured by the
number of BrdU+ nuclei or by qPCR for the general proliferation
marker Ki67 and for the transient amplifying C cell marker, EGFR
(Fig. 8a). At 12 days following MCAO, the amount of proliferation increased
much more, by approximately two fold. This suggests that
there are inhibitory conditionswhichcounteract the pro-neurogenic effects
of the earlier increased CNTF. We therefore measured expression
of the family members IL-6 (Vallieres et al., 2002)andLIF( Bauer and
Patterson, 2006), and the inflammatory cytokine, TNFα (Iosif et al.,
2006, 2008), which can reduce adult neurogenesis in vivo. IL-6 expression
levels were very high at 1 day and returned to baseline levels at
5 days post-MCAO (Fig. 8b) suggesting that it does not regulate
neurogenesis at the later times. IL-6 expression was not significantly affected
by the 15 min MCAO at 1 day (1.82±0.69 versus sham 1.00±
0.09,p=0.33,n=5 and 4). LIF and TNFαboth showed increased levels
at 1 and 5 days compared to sham‐operated mice, and decreased to
baseline levels at 12 days. The increase in these pro-inflammatory

C57BL/6 mice. As shown in coronal sections through the SVZ (arrows) and striatum (STR), the number of BrdU+ SVZ nuclei appeared to be increased after a 30 min occlusion (c), compared
to sham-treated mice (a). The 15 min (b) and 45 min occlusion times did not seem to affect the number of proliferated SVZ cells (d). Note the clear anatomical separation between
the BrdU+ inflammatory cells in the striatum and the progenitors in the SVZ. BrdU+ SVZ nuclei were also readily identifiable by their much smaller size. Scale bar 250 μm. CC=corpus

cytokines suggested that inflammatory responses in the SVZ and neighboring
striatum could have reduced the expected increase in
neurogenesis 1 week afterMCAO. Inastrocyte–neuroncocultures,addition
of 20 ng/ml TNFα or 10 ng/ml LIF for 24 h did not significantly
change CNTF expression (qPCR from 3 independent experiments, data
not shown), suggesting that the inhibition could be caused by different
mechanisms competing with those that are downstream of CNTF. Sections
stained for the general leukocyte marker CD45 showed increasing
proximity and amount to the SVZ with increasing MCAO occlusion time
(Fig. 9a–c). Of note was the inflammation within the SVZ seen in the
45 min MCAO group at 7 days (Fig. 9c). The 15 min MCAO values
were greater at 14 than at 7 days (pb0.05, suggesting a need for inflammatory
signaling to increase neurogenesis (see BrdU values inFig. 3a).
Inflammation was much greater in the 45 min MCAO group than the
30 min MCAO group at 7 days (pb0.01), suggesting that too much inflammation reduces the neurogenic response (compare to Fig. 3a).
This is also suggested by the findings in the 30 min MCAO group,
where inflammation was less pronounced at 14 relative to 7 days
(Fig. 9d; pb0.01), consistent with the reduced TNFα levels at later
post-MCAO times (Fig. 8b), but when neurogenesis was increased
greatly (Fig. 3a).
Discussion
CNTF mediates stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis
Our main results suggest that CNTF plays a crucial role in the neurogenic
response to focal ischemic MCAO of the neighboring striatum. The
increase in SVZ proliferation was related to CNTF expression in C57BL/6
mice, where a 30 min MCAO caused both anincrease in BrdU+ SVZ nuclei
and CNTF, whereas the 15 min MCAO had no or only small effects.
The lack of a significant proliferative response in CNTF−/− mice suggests
that all of the response is normally mediated by CNTF. This central
role is also supported by thefinding that expression of other CNTF family
members IL-6 or LIF, which both signal through gp130 (Bauer et al.,
2007; Suzuki et al., 2009), showed no or only a small amount of

compensation, respectively, for the lack of CNTF in CNTF−/− mice.
Also, the time course of LIF or IL-6 expression in the SVZ of C57BL/6
mice after a 30 min MCAO was not predictive of the stroke‐induced
neurogenic response. LIF, but not CNTF, appears to be involved during
the neurogenic response induced by perinatal ischemia (Covey and
Levison, 2007). CNTF levels in the CNS increase only postnatally
(Stockli et al., 1989) and it is possibly that CNTF takes over the former
role played by LIF.
CNTF as a potential regulable endogenous target after stroke
Ourfinding that CNTF increases after MCAO is consistent with other
studies that show large increases in CNTF mRNA in the cortex of MCAO
injured rats (Lin et al., 1998). Here, we show the need for increased
CNTF expression close to or within the SVZ for it to enhance
neurogenesis. CNTF in the SVZ is produced by the resident astrocytes
(Yang et al., 2008), a cell type which typically does not die after stroke
and thus remains available as a growth factor factory in degenerative
conditions. Thefinding that CNTF mediates most or all of the increased
proliferation following ischemic stroke is important as it suggests that
its production remains amenable to pharmacological induction. Previously
, we have shown that a D2 dopamine agonist (Yang et al., 2008)
and a P2X7 antagonist (Kang et al., unpublished results) can increase
CNTF expression in the SVZ of naive adult mice. It will be important to
determine whether such drugs can be used to produce more neurons
for replacement of lost neurons after stroke.
The mechanisms that lead to the stroke-induced increases in CNTF
remain to be defined. CNTF most likely increases in the SVZ itself because
CNTF expression is much greater in the SVZ than the neighboring
striatum (Yang et al., 2008) and our gene expression measurements
were made within tissue that contains the SVZ but not the injured
striatal tissue. The slow increase in the SVZ compared to the almost immediate
response in the striatum (Kang et al., 2012) suggests that the
SVZ response is not due to the rapid loss of neurons or ischemia in the
SVZ. The lack of a clear increase in CNTF expression after the 15 min
MCAO,where the distance of injuredtissue to theSVZ islarge compared
to the 30 min MCAO, suggests that diffusible factors are involved. If so,
this would provide a promising opportunity because the receptors of
such diffusible agents could be targeted with pharmacological drugs
to increase CNTF, thus increasing SVZ neurogenesis. The lack of
CD45+ cells close to the SVZ after a 15 min MCAO suggests that
pro-inflammatory mechanisms might be involved. One inflammatory
regulator of CNTF might be the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 whose
expression was transiently increased at 24 h in the SVZ following the
30 min (Fig. 8b) but not the 15 min MCAO. IL-6 can up-regulate CNTF
mRNA in dorsal root ganglion culture (Shuto et al., 2001).
CNTF regulates SVZ neurogenesis possibly by inducing FGF2
Our data also suggest some of the likely mechanisms that underlie
the neurogenic effects of CNTF. The CNTF-selective alpha receptors in
the SVZ are exclusively present on GFAP-positive cells which mainly
are astrocytes but might also include the much sparser neural stem
cells (Emsley and Hagg, 2003). Others have shown in vitro and in vivo
that, in the presence of EGF, CNTF stimulates SVZ neural stem cell
self-renewal via Notch1 signaling (Chojnacki et al., 2003). However,
this mechanism does not appear to be affected by the MCAO-induced
CNTF. The neural stem cell marker Sox2 (Ellis et al., 2004)andthelow
EGF levels were unaltered in the SVZ. Although Notch1 expression
was increased in the SVZ following MCAO, this did not result in Notch
signaling as the expression of downstream Hes1 or Hes5, both promoters
of self-renewal (Nakamura et al., 2000; Ohtsuka et al., 2001),
were not significantly changed. Notch1 expression was also increased
in the CNTF−/− mice after MCAO, suggesting that CNTF was not involved.
LIF was increased in the SVZ of both CNTF−/− mice and their
littermate controls, and might have caused the increase in Notch1 expression
as it does in the neonate SVZ (Covey and Levison, 2007)and
in embryonic neuroepithelial cells (Faux et al., 2001).
Our data support the idea that MCAO-induced CNTF affects the rapidly
proliferating transient amplifying progenitor cells, also named C
cells. Expression of EGFR, which is present on C cells (Doetsch et al.,
2002), was increased 4 fold. Moreover, Mash1, which is involved in
the initial step from neural stem cell to progenitor transition (Torii et
al., 1999), was increased by the MCAO. However, the effect of CNTF on
the C cells was probably not mediated by the induction of Mash1, as
this increase was not significantly different between CNTF−/− and
wildtype mice.
Since the CNTF receptor alpha is only expressed by GFAP-positive
cells, the mechanism underlying the effects of MCAO-induced CNTF
on C cells most likely involves a different releasable astroglial factor.
FGF2 is another major regulator of neurogenesis in the SVZ (Mudo et
al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2004). FGF2 is expressed and released by
GFAP-positive cells of SVZ but is not present in proliferating precursor
cells (Mudo et al., 2009). Ourfinding that FGF2 expression in the
SVZ is increased after MCAO in wildtype but not in CNTF−/− mice
suggests that its induction is CNTF-dependent. The mechanisms by
which FGF-2 might affect the progenitor populations remain to be
resolved (Mudo et al., 2009). Notch1 and Mash1 are probably not involved
as they were increased in the absence of an increase of FGF2
in the CNTF−/−mice after MCAO. FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 are expressed
in the C cells (Frinchi et al., 2008; Mudo et al., 2009), as well as in the
self-renewing neural stem cells. FGF2, in contrast to EGF, promotes

number of BrdU+ nuclei (left columns) and dcx-stained neuroblasts (right columns)
was clearly increased at 14 days following an MCAO as compared to sham-operate

new neuroblasts in the SVZ. n=4 each. **pb0.01. (b) The levels of CNTF mRNA

an increase in the number of newborn neurons in the SVZ (Kuhn et
al., 1997). We had previously found that CNTF increases SVZ proliferation
without changing the normal neuronal cell-fate decision
(Emsley and Hagg, 2003). Others have shown that a severe 60 min
MCAO injury in mice, which our data suggest would have injured
the SVZ, produces predominantly astrocytes from the SVZ migrating
to the striatum after 14 days (Li et al., 2010). Our data suggest that
after a less severe 30 min injury most additional new cells in the
SVZ, as identified by BrdU, become dcx-positive neuroblasts at
14 days post-injury. This suggests that as long as the stroke region
does not reach the SVZ, stroke-induced CNTF-FGF2 also favors normal
neuronal fate decisions. Thus, the FGF2-mediated effects of endogenous
CNTF may make it a good target for inducing production
of new neurons. Moreover, CNTF is predominantly expressed in
the nervous system (Stockli et al., 1989) making it a nervous
system‐selective endogenous target. Although we did not test
whether the stroke-induced neurogenesis was beneficial, others
have shown in rats and mice that it correlates with better behavioral
outcomes (Ishibashi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2004).
Stroke-induced inflammation and LIF may compete with the neurogenic
activity of CNTF
The discrepancy in high CNTF expression in the SVZ at 1 week following
MCAO and the low increase in proliferation may be explained
by competing inhibitory mechanisms at that time. The temporal
pattern of TNFαexpression, which others have also seen after stroke
(Lambertsen et al., 2005, 2007), would suggest that it is one of the
major inhibitors. TNFα has been shown to reduce progenitor SVZ
and hippocampal proliferation through the TNF receptor-1 (Iosif
et al., 2008; Iosif et al., 2006). Our astrocyte culture data suggest
that TNFα does not affect CNTF expression but likely inhibits
proliferation via other mechanisms. The anti-neurogenic effects
of irradiation-induced inflammation have been well-documented
(Monje et al., 2003; Voloboueva et al., 2010). Our results suggest
that MCAO-induced inflammation close to and within the SVZ
prevented the neurogenic response to MCAO. However, our 15 min
MCAO data showing low CD45, low CNTF and low neurogenesis suggests
that a delicate balance between beneficial and detrimental inflammation determines the extent of stroke-induced neurogenesis.
LIF reportedly has pro-neurogenic activities for olfactory epithelial
NSCs (Bauer and Patterson, 2006; Bauer et al., 2003), and after perinatal
ischemia (Covey and Levison, 2007). On the other hand, our data are
more consistent with the finding that LIF leads to increased
self-renewal of NSC in the brain at the expense of neurogenesis
(Bauer and Patterson, 2006). Like our data in the SVZ, CNTF expression
in the peri-ischemic region is gradually increased to 14 days (Lin et al.,
1998), but the expression pattern of LIF peaks at 24 h and lasts 7 days
after stroke (Suzuki et al., 1999, 2000). Thus, it is possible that LIF initiates
NSC self-renewal during thefirst week after MCAO and, due to its
reduced expression into week 2, only then allows CNTF to robustly increase
neurogenesis. The only difference between LIF and CNTF

signaling is the requirement for CNTFα receptor to activate the LIFβ
receptor/gp130 dimer. How these differences would explain the different
neurogenic properties of CNTF and LIF is not clear. A better understanding
of the interplay between and CNTF, LIF and TNFα and their
receptors is expected to help us design pharmacological treatments to
optimize neurogenesis following stroke.
Very selective conditions are needed for stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis
in mice
The second main contribution of this study is to provide a platform
for further studies by defining very specific MCAO conditions and stereological
counting methods. The current data in C57BL/6 mice show
that the conditions for a robust increase in SVZ neurogenesis are very
specific and require a 30 min MCAO and a 2 week period afterwards.
This is very different from the neurogenic conditions seen in rats
where of SVZ proliferation increases by 35% within 2 days and increases
even more to 7–14 days after MCAO (Jin et al., 2001; Parent et al., 2002;
Zhang et al., 2001). The literature in mice is not extensive and seems
discrepant, where MCAO is reported to markedly increase proliferating
SVZ cells already after 1 day, lasting for at least 14 days (Tanaka et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2007) or reduces SVZ proliferation after 3 days
with a return to normal levels at 7 days (Tsai et al., 2006). Also, the
reported MCAO times of 45 or more minutes or of small cortical injuries
caused by distal MCAO seem to contradict ourfindings that extensive or
small injuries, respectively, do not increase SVZ proliferation. We propose
that the technical difficulties in mice related to MCAO filament
sizes as well as the lack of unbiased stereological counting methods
may explain the apparent discrepancies with our study. Our study
seems to be the first one in mice to use unbiased stereology covering
the entire SVZ of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. In contrast
to rat, the infarct size of mice after MCAO seems to be much more sensitive
to the diameter of the monofilament, perhaps because of the very
small arteries in mice. Previously, a relationship between body weight
and the diameter of monofilament needed to successfully achieve

contrast, CNTF−/− mice showed no significant increase (18±10%) compared to their
shams and the BrdU value was significantly lower than that of the heterozygous mice.

by qPCR for the proliferation marker Ki67 and for the transient amplifying C cell
marker, EGFR. The number of BrdU+ cells is from another set of mice shown in Fig. 3a
for comparison to Ki67. At 12 days following MCAO, when CNTF levels had increased
from 3‐to 4‐fold, the amount of proliferation had increased much more, to approximately
2‐fold of sham. This suggests that at earlier on after MCAO, the effects of CNTF are
inhibited. (b) Expression of inflammatory cytokines with known inhibitory effects on
neurogenesis was measured by qPCR in the same tissues as in (a). IL-6 expression was increased

were increased about 5-fold and 15-fold, respectively, at 1 and 5 days compared to
sham‐operated mice, and decreased to baseline levels at 12 days (n of 1, 5, 12 day

sufficient occlusion was reported (Hata etal., 1998). Here, we show that
use of DOCCOL 0.21 mm tipped filaments can be applied to a greater
weight range and are much more reliable than filaments made in the
laboratory. The occlusion time is the most important factor determining
the extent of the ischemic injury and our results are in line with those of
another study (McColl et al., 2004). We do note that accurately applied
MCAO of 30 min results in severe neurological deficits and without intensive
care results in high mortality rates. The 45 min occlusion caused
high mortality irrespectively. In one study (Li et al., 2010), survival after
a 60 min MCAO was possible by keeping mice on a heating pad for the
first week (Dr. Lee Anna Cunningham, personal communication). Our
data show that long occlusion times most likely injure the SVZ and reduce
the MCAO-induced proliferative response. Lastly, the use of Dopplerflowmetry is essential to ensure confidence in inclusion of mice in a
study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that endogenous CNTF in
the mouse SVZ mediates stroke-induced neurogenesis, possibly by
inducing FGF2 and mainly affecting C cell proliferation, providing a
valid target for pharmacological drug development to further stimulate
neurogenesis. We have shown proof of concept that such a
systemic drug approach utilizing endogenous CNTF can induce
neurogenesis in the naive mouse (Yang et al., 2008). We also suggest
that pro-inflammatory factors, including TNFα, are inhibitory to
neurogenesis during the 7 days post-injury and that their inhibition
may further increase neurogenesis for treatment after stroke. Lastly,
we find that focal ischemic injury in mice by MCAO enhances SVZ
neurogenesis only under very specific conditions, involving more severe
injuries and being much delayed compared to rats. Having defined
these conditions in mice will help the neurogenesis field to move forward
in a much more consistent and reliable manner by assessing the
multitude of genetically modified mice currently available.

Fig. 9. Inflammation reaches the SVZ following severe ischemic injury MCAO. Coronal
sections through the SVZ (arrows) and striatum (STR) stained for the general leukocyte
marker CD45 show paucity of inflammation close to the SVZ following a 15 min
MCAO (a). After a 30 min MCAO (b), the inflammatory response appeared closer to
the SVZ. After a 45 min MCAO (c) CD45+ cells were seen in most of the brain as
well as within the SVZ. (d) The area of CD45+ (total red pixels minus the
non-specific staining of white matter bundles through the striatum, some indicated
by an asterisk) was measured and calculated as a percentage of the total striatal area
shown. Note that both very low (15 min MCAO) and very high levels (45 min
MCAO) of inflammation correspond to low increases in proliferation in the SVZ as
shown in the same mice in Fig. 3a. LV=lateral ventricle.
