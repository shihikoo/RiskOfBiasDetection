High temperature requirement protein A1 (HtrA1) is a primarily
secreted serine protease involved in a variety of cellular processes
including transforming growth factorβ (TGF-β)signaling.Lossofits
activity causes cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), an inherited
form of cerebral small vessel disease leading to early-onset stroke
and premature dementia. Dysregulated TGF-β signaling is considered
to promote CARASIL pathogenesis, but the underlying molecular
mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we present
evidence from mouse brain tissue and embryonic fibroblasts as well
as patient skin fibroblasts for a facilitating role of HtrA1 in TGF-β
pathway activation. We identify latent TGF-β binding protein 1
(LTBP-1), an extracellular matrix protein and key regulator of TGF-β
bioavailability, as a novel HtrA1 target. Cleavage occurs at physiological
protease concentrations, is prevented under HtrA1-deficient
conditions as well as by CARASIL mutations and disrupts both
LTBP-1 binding to fibronectin and its incorporation into the extracellular
matrix. Hence, our data suggest an attenuation of TGF-β
signaling caused by a lack of HtrA1-mediated LTBP-1 processing as
mechanism underlying CARASIL pathogenesis.
small vessel disease | proteolysis | extracellular matrix | LTBP-1
Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) accounts for roughly one
fifth of all strokes worldwide and is recognized as a major cause
of cognitive decline and dementia (1). Familial forms of SVD have
successfully been used as model conditions for mechanistic studies
on SVD (2–4). CARASIL (cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), a recessive
SVD, is characterized by juvenile and recurrent strokes,
extensive brain white matter lesions, and premature dementia (5).
The disease is caused by mutations in the HTRA1 (high temperature
requirement protein A1) gene (6) encoding an evolutionarily
conserved serine protease (7). CARASIL mutations typically result
in loss of HtrA1 activity, suggesting impaired substrate processing
as a disease mechanism (6, 8, 9).
HtrA1 has been shown to degrade a number of substrates,
most of which are situated in the extracellular compartment, thus
suggesting the extracellular space as primary location of HtrA1
function. HtrA1-mediated proteolysis has been implicated in various
disease processes such as neurodegeneration (10, 11), agerelated
macular degeneration (12, 13), carcinogenesis (14) and
arthritis (15). Only recently, identification of HTRA1 as the
CARASIL-causing gene has highlighted its role in the vascular
system and in TGF-β signaling, a well-defined regulator of angiogenesis
and vascular homeostasis (16, 17) known to be implicated
in several vascular conditions including Marfan Syndrome, Loeys–
Dietz Syndrome, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (18).
Initial studies on CARASIL reported increased levels of the
TGF-β prodomain (also called latency-associated peptide, LAP)
and of TGF-βtarget genes in the cerebral vasculature of affected
patients. This finding led to the proposition that up-regulation
of the TGF-β pathway drives CARASIL pathogenesis (6, 8).
However, the initial results were mostly obtained using overexpressing
cells and autopsy material from advanced cases. Also,
there is some controversy as to how HtrA1 interferes with TGF-β
signaling. Proposed mechanisms include HtrA1-mediated extracellular
cleavage of mature TGF-β (19, 20), cleavage of TGF-β
receptors (21), and intracellular degradation of LAP (8).
To better define the mechanistic link between HtrA1 and TGF-β
and to identify physiological HtrA1 substrates relevant for CARASIL
we investigated the effects of HtrA1 deficiency on the TGF-β
pathway in brain tissue and embryonic fibroblasts from HTRA1
knockout mice and in skin fibroblasts from a CARASIL patient.
Unexpectedly, we observed a consistent reduction of TGF-βactivity
in both murine and human material suggesting a facilitating role
of HtrA1 in TGF-β signaling. We further identified latent TGF-β
Significance
Cerebral small vesseldisease (SVD) is a majorcauseof strokeand
dementia. Hereditary forms, such as cerebral autosomal recessive
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
(CARASIL), may provide insights into key molecular
mechanisms and pathways. The serine protease HtrA1, whose
activity is impaired in CARASIL, has been proposed to attenuate
TGF-β signaling leading to increased pathway activity in diseased
arteries. We analyzed HtrA1-deficient mouse brain tissue
and mouse and CARASIL patient fibroblasts and found a reduction
in signaling activity on various pathway levels suggesting
a facilitating role of HtrA1. Moreover, we identified
LTBP-1 as a novel HtrA1 substrate and provide evidence for its
functional modulation by HtrA1-dependent proteolysis. Our
data suggest down-regulation of TGF-β signaling as a key
mechanism underlying CARASIL pathogenesis.

binding protein-1 (LTBP-1), a matricellular factor with a major
role in TGF-β bioactivation (16, 22) as a novel physiological
HtrA1 substrate and report on the functional consequences
of its processing. Our findings point to a down-regulation of the
TGF-βpathway in CARASIL pathogenesis and suggest LTBP-1
as a key HtrA1 substrate.
Results
Loss of HtrA1 Function Results in Reduced TGF-β Signaling. To study
the consequences of HtrA1 deficiency on the TGF-β pathway we
made use of a knockout mouse model generated by gene trapping.
Insertion of the trapping vector into the first intron of the
HTRA1 gene resulted in the generation of a truncated transcript
lacking exons 2–9( Fig. S1 A and B). Loss of HtrA1 expression
was demonstrated in various tissues on mRNA level by real-time
PCR (Fig. 1A) and in mouse brain on protein level by combined
immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). TGF-β signaling
was analyzed by immunohistological analysis of SMAD2/3
phosphorylation, an intracellular indicator of TGF-β activity, using
mouse brain sections. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant decrease
in HtrA1-deficient mice (Fig. 1C), which was confirmed by
Western blot analysis of brain lysates (Fig. S2). We further analyzed
mRNA levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a well
known TGF-β target gene (23), and detected a ∼50% reduction in
the brains from young and agedHTRA1knockout animals (Fig. 1D).
To further substantiate these findings, fibroblasts were isolated
from wild-type or HtrA1-deficient mouse embryos and
immortalized by serial passaging yielding several independent
mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) lines. HtrA1 expression or
deficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. S3A) and by
immunoblotting of culture medium (Fig. S3B). To analyze the
TGF-β pathway, we first quantified TGF-β1 in MEF culture
medium using an ELISA and observed a ∼40% reduction in
HTRA1 knockout cells (Fig. 2A,Left). Levels of bioactive TGF-β
determined by a cellular reporter assay based on secreted alkaline
phosphatase (SEAP) (24) (Fig. S4 A and B) were also decreased
(Fig. 2A, Right). We next analyzed phosphoSMAD2/3
levels by immunoblotting and similar to brain tissue observed
a strong reduction in HtrA1-deficient cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover,
these cells expressed markedly decreased mRNA levels of the
TGF-βtarget genes CTGF and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1
(PAI-1) (Fig. S3C). In summary, these results indicated reduced
TGF-β pathway activity in HtrA1-deficient mice.
To confirm these findings in human cells, we used skin fibroblasts
isolated from a CARASIL patient of Pakistanian origin,
who showed typical signs of cerebral small vessel disease as well as
lumbar spondylosis and alopecia and was found to carry a previously
unreported HtrA1 mutation (A173T). In culture medium
of patient fibroblasts, both total and bioactive TGF-β levels were
decreased by ∼80% in comparison with cells from a control individual
(Fig. 2C). Moreover, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation could
not be detected in lysates from these cells (Fig. 2D) and CTGF as
well as PAI-1 mRNA levels were strongly reduced (Fig. 2E).
These findings confirmed our data obtained in mice suggesting
a facilitating role of HtrA1 in TGF-β signaling. Because the observed
effects were in contrast to previously reported observations
and could not be explained by processing of the proposed HtrA1
substrates mature TGF-β (19, 20), LAP (8), or TGF-β receptors
(21), we set out to search for alternative candidate substrates.
HtrA1 Efficiently Processes the N-Terminal Region of LTBP-1.In a first
step toward the identification of novel HtrA1 substrates, we
determined the localization of HtrA1 in MEF cultures, by immunoblotting
of conditioned medium as well as cytosolic and
extracellular matrix (ECM) fractions obtained by sequential
protein extraction. Although HtrA1 was barely detectable in cell
lysates, high levels were present in the medium demonstrating
efficient secretion (Fig. 3A). Of note, substantial amounts could also
be observed in the ECM fraction, characterized by the presence of
fibronectin, prompting us to consider ECM-associated proteins with
aroleinTGF- β signaling as promising HtrA1 substrates.
Members of the latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP) family
are part of the large latency complex (LLC) that anchors TGF-β
to the ECM (22). LTBP-1 is the best characterized member of
this family and undergoes proteolytic processing resulting in
activation of TGF-β (25–28). We therefore investigated LTBP-1
as a potential HtrA1 substrate using an in vitro proteolysis assay
involving treatment of culture medium from LTBP-1-transfected
cells with increasing concentrations of purified, recombinant
HtrA1. Immunoblotting revealed a dose- and time-dependent
conversion of full-length LTBP-1 to a fragment of lower molecular

weight (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5A). Processing was detected at HtrA1
concentrations as low as 1 nM, whereas degradation of LAP or
mature TGF-β required much higher concentrations (100–1,000
nM, Fig. 3B). The generation of a stable LTBP-1 cleavage product
indicated limited proteolysis rather than global degradation (Fig.
S5B). To determine the effect of HtrA1 loss-of-function mutations
, LTBP-1 proteolysis was analyzed using conditioned supernatants
from HEK293 cells transfected with constructs encoding
wild-type HtrA1, the active site mutant S328A or various CARASIL
mutants including A173T (Fig. S6). Whereas medium containing
wild-type HtrA1 produced a cleavage pattern similar to
that obtained with purified protease, medium from cells expressing
mutant HtrA1 left LTBP-1 mainly intact despite efficient secretion
(Fig. 3C). We, therefore, conclude that LTBP-1 represents an efficient
, previously unknown substrate for HtrA1.
To localize the cleavage region, we used epitope-tagged and
truncated LTBP-1 expression constructs (Fig. 4A). Detection of
cleavage products derived from full-length LTBP-1 containing
epitope tags at both ends revealed a C-terminal fragment similar
to that observed with the untagged LTBP-1 construct (Fig. 4B,
Left) and an array of poorly defined 40–60 kDa N-terminal fragments
(Fig. 4B, Right) indicating proteolysis within the N-terminal
region. Accordingly, we found no cleavage of an N-terminal deletion
variant (∆N-LTBP-1) (Fig. 4C, Left), whereas a C-terminally
truncated variant (∆C-LTBP-1) was clearly processed (Fig.
4C, Center). To map the precise cleavage site, we purified ∆CLTBP-1
and exposed it to purified HtrA1 resulting in the appearance
of two major cleavage products, with the larger one corresponding
in size and immunoreactivity to the fragment observed
before (Fig. 4C, Right). Analysis of both fragments by Edman
degradation revealed identical N-terminal sequences demonstrating
cleavage between the Val224-Ala225 and Ala225-Ala226 bonds of
LTBP-1. Hence, HtrA1 cleaves within a region located upstream of
the known protease-sensitive hinge region of LTBP-1 (Fig. 4A).
To analyze LTBP-1 processing by endogenous HtrA1, we
performed the cleavage assay with concentrated culture medium
from MEF cells containing HtrA1 concentrations in the
range of 5–25 nM. Wild-type cell culture medium converted
LTBP-1 to a fragment similar to that generated by purified or
HEK293 cell-derived HtrA1, whereas medium from HtrA1
knockout cells left LTBP-1 intact (Fig. 5A). Processing was
abolished by the selective HtrA1 inhibitor NVP-LBG976 (10), but
persisted in the presence of the metalloprotease inhibitor EDTA
confirming the specificity of the cleavage (Fig. 5B). Altogether
these observations point to HtrA1 as a major LTBP-1-processing
protease and indicate an impairment of LTBP-1 cleavage in the
absence of HtrA1.

(Fig. 4A) (29, 30), a crucial step during LTBP-1 incorporation
into the ECM (31, 32). To investigate the consequences of
HtrA1-dependent LTBP-1 processing on this interaction, we
established an in vitro solid-phase assay measuring binding of
HEK293 cell-derived LTBP-1 to immobilized purified fibronectin
(Fig. S7A). In this assay, LTBP-1 showed a dose-dependent
binding (Fig. S7B), that was restricted to fibronectin among a set
of adhesive matrix proteins (Fig. S7C). An association was also
observed with ∆C-LTBP-1, but not with ∆N-LTBP-1 lacking the
fibronectin binding region (Fig. S7D). Treatment of full-length
LTBP-1 or∆C-LTBP-1 with purified HtrA1 or HtrA1-containing
culture medium before the binding assay drastically decreased
their binding to fibronectin, an effect that was not detected upon
treatment with culture medium containing the active site mutant
S328A (Fig. 6A). Similarly, ∆C-A225-LTBP-1, a truncated form
mimicking the proteolytic fragment generated by HtrA1 (see Fig.
4A), showed an equally reduced binding suggesting a role of
HtrA1-mediated proteolysis in regulating the LTBP-1–fibronectin
interaction (Fig. S7E).
Next, we adapted our binding assay to measure the interaction of
LTBP-1 with the ECM produced by primary murine aortic smooth
muscle cells (AoSMC). After 7 d in culture, these cells have deposited
a matrix containing an extensive fibronectin network (Fig.
S7F). Following matrix production, AoSMCs were fixed, exposed to
LTBP-1–containing cell culture medium and binding was quantified
as described before. In contrast to ∆N-LTBP-1, full-length LTBP-1
and ΔC-LTBP-1 showed efficient binding (Fig. S7G), which was
significantly reduced upon prior treatment with purified HtrA1 (Fig.
6B). These findings indicated that HtrA1-mediated LTBP-1 cleavage
prevents its association with the ECM.
Finally, we transfected MEF cells with either∆C-LTBP-1 or∆CA225-LTBP-1
and evaluated their integration into the ECM. Sequential
extraction revealed that both LTBP-1 forms were present
in comparable levels in the tubulin-rich cellular fraction and in the
culture medium (Fig. 6C) demonstrating equally efficient expression
and secretion. However,∆C- LTBP-1 showed a much stronger
accumulation in the matrix fraction than ∆C-A225-LTBP-1. Immunofluorescence
analysis confirmed the impaired association
of the ∆C-A225-LTBP-1 variant with the ECM (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
By analyzing brain tissue and embryonic fibroblasts fromHTRA1
knockout mice as well as primary fibroblasts from a CARASIL
patient we found loss of HtrA1 function to be associated with
down-regulation of the TGF-β pathway. We further identified
LTBP-1, a key extracellular regulator of TGF-βbioactivation (22),
as a novel HtrA1 substrate. These findings shed light on the role
of HtrA1 in TGF-β signaling and advance our understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying CARASIL pathogenesis.
A physiological relevance of LTBP-1 processing by HtrA1 is
strongly suggested by the following observations: First, proteolysis
of LTBP-1 in vitro occurred at HtrA1 concentrations as low as
1 nM, which is in the physiological range (33). In contrast, cleavage
of mature TGF-β and LAP required 10- to 100-fold higher
protease concentrations making it unlikely that they represent
biologically relevant substrates. Second, we provide direct evidence
for substrate cleavage by endogenous, MEF-derived HtrA1,
whereas previous studies used purified or overexpressed HtrA1.
Of note, overexpression may cause protease retention in the endoplasmic
reticulum, where Shiga et al. (8) observed LAP degradation.
Third, we found LTBP-1 processing to be prevented by
HtrA1 deficiency, by a specific HtrA1 inhibitor and by CARASIL
loss-of-function mutations arguing for the specificity of the

cleavage. At least in cultured fibroblasts, HtrA1 appears
to represent the predominant LTBP-1 processing protease.
Fourth, the efficient secretion of HtrA1 and incorporation into
the ECM of cultured fibroblasts demonstrates spatial proximity
of protease and substrate. Finally, we found LTBP-1 to undergo
limited processing rather than global degradation. Site-specific
LTBP-1 proteolysis has been shown to result in its detachment
from ECM and in TGF-βrelease and activation (25–28). In accord
with this finding, we observed decreased LTBP-1 incorporation
into ECM upon HtrA1-mediated cleavage and an attenuation
of TGF-β activity in HtrA1-deficient tissues and cells. Our
findings in fibroblasts suggest a dysregulation of TGF-β
signaling also in noncerebral tissue, a systemic effect is nevertheless
unlikely because TGF-β pathway alterations were not
observed in several other tissues and serum from HTRA1
knockout mice.
Our findings contrast with previous studies that have
reported an increase in TGF-β signaling in CARASIL brains (6,
8). However, they were restricted to two autopsy cases with limited
information on histopathological samples and it cannot be excluded
that the observations reflect fibrotic changes of blood
vessels in advanced disease stages. On the other hand, HTRA1
knockout mice and patient fibroblasts, the model systems used in
our study, do not cover all clinical and molecular aspects of
CARASIL. HTRA1 knockout mice are viable, have a normal life
expectancy and display no obvious disease symptoms. Although
a detailed characterization of these mice is in progress, studies of
other monogenic SVDs have revealed that human pathology is
difficult to recapitulate in mouse models (34). Despite these limitations
we nevertheless consider the consistency of results
obtained from two different species as good evidence for their
disease relevance. Future studies will have to address the discrepancies
in TGF-β signaling activity and to validate HtrA1-
mediated LTBP-1 processing as a mechanism driving CARASIL
pathogenesis.
Our findings add to current evidence suggesting a role of
the TGF-β signaling pathway for normal vascular function. Of
note, mutations in components of this pathway or its interacting
partners result in severe vascular defects, as illustrated by Loeys-
Dietz syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and
Marfan syndrome (18). Specifically, our results reinforce a role
of ECM-mediated TGF-β sequestration which is considered a
crucial step in the temporal and spatial regulation of TGF-β
activity (35). TGF-β incorporation into the ECM is mediated
by interactions between LTBPs and two major structural ECM
constituents, fibrillin-1 and fibronectin (36). Importantly,
Marfan syndrome has not only been attributed to fibrillin-1 
mutations,butalsoshowntobeassociatedwithalteredTGF-β
signaling (37).
Interestingly, dysregulated TGF-β signaling has also been implicated
in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease (38). In addition,
data from a recent study conducted in our laboratory indicate a role
of LTBP-1 in the pathogenesis of cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
(CADASIL) (39), another monogenic SVD showing considerable
phenotypic overlap with CARASIL.
In conclusion, our findings provide an unexpected link between
the TGF-β signaling pathway and CARASIL which might
also be of relevance to the more common forms of cerebral small
vessel disease.
