Arrick DM, Sun H, Mayhan WG. Influence of exercise training
on ischemic brain injury in type 1 diabetic rats. J Appl Physiol 113: 1121–1127, 2012. First published August 2, 2012;
doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00437.2012.—While exercise training (ExT)
appears to influence cerebrovascular function during type 1 diabetes
(T1D), it is not clear whether this beneficial effect extends to protecting
the brain from ischemia-induced brain injury. Thus our goal was
to examine whether modest ExT could influence transient focal
ischemia-induced brain injury along with nitric oxide synthase
(NOS)-dependent dilation of cerebral (pial) arterioles during T1D.
Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: nondiabetic
sedentary, nondiabetic ExT, diabetic (streptozotocin; 50 mg/kg ip)
sedentary, and diabetic ExT. In the first series of studies, we measured
infarct volume in all groups of rats following right MCA occlusion for
2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. In a second series of studies, a
craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex, and we measured
responses of pial arterioles to an endothelial NOS (eNOS)-dependent,
a neuronal NOS (nNOS)-dependent, and a NOS-independent agonist
in all groups of rats. We found that sedentary diabetic rats had
significantly larger total, cortical, and subcortical infarct volumes
following ischemia-reperfusion than sedentary nondiabetic, nondiabetic
ExT, and diabetic ExT rats. Infarct volumes were similar in
sedentary nondiabetic, ExT nondiabetic, and ExT diabetic rats. In
contrast, ExT did not alter infarct size in nondiabetic compared with
sedentary nondiabetic rats. In addition, ExT diabetic rats had impaired
eNOS- and nNOS-dependent, but not NOS-independent, vasodilation
that was restored by ExT. Thus ExT of T1D rats lessened ischemic
brain injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion and restored
impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent vascular function. Since the
incidence of ischemic stroke is increased during T1D, we suggest that
our finding are significant in that modest ExT may be a viable
preventative therapeutic approach to lessen ischemia-induced brain
injury that may occur in T1D subjects.
ADP; NMDA; nitroglycerin; pial arterioles; middle cerebral artery

EXERCISE TRAINING (EXT) HAS been shown to be beneficial for
reducing the risk of premature death and disease, including
cardiovascular- and cerebrovascular-related diseases. Investigators
have suggested that ExT may reduce the risk of these
diseases by influencing many diverse cellular networks. ExT
has been shown to increase the synthesis/release of a number of
important growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, fibroblast growth factor,
insulin-like growth factor-I) to promote neurogenesis, suppress
inflammation and apoptosis, enhance endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) and eNOS-dependent vascular function,
and/or increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in blood
and in tissues of several organ systems (7, 13–19, 21, 27, 35,
37–39, 44, 47, 49). Thus the protective effects of ExT on the
peripheral and cerebral circulations may be based on maintaining
an adequate blood supply, maintaining vascular function,
suppressing inflammation, and enhancing repair processes.
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and
permanent disability in humans. Epidemiological studies have
suggested that diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) is a critical
risk factor for ischemic stroke (2, 5, 22, 25) and worsens
outcome following ischemic stroke (3, 22, 48). In previous studies
, our laboratory reported that impaired eNOS- and neuronal
nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-dependent responses of cerebral
arterioles and the basilar artery observed in type 1 diabetes
(T1D) rats could be restored to that observed in nondiabetic
rats by modest ExT (30, 31). In addition, we found that
superoxide levels were increased in sedentary diabetic rats, and
ExT inhibited this increase in superoxide (31). Although ExT
appears to influence vascular function in large and small
cerebral blood vessels during T1D via an influence on oxidative
stress, it is not clear whether the beneficial effects of ExT
during T1D extend to protecting the brain from ischemiainduced
brain injury. Thus the goal of the present study was to
determine whether ExT could affect brain injury following
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion during T1D. In addition, we
examined the potential relationship between ischemia-induced
brain injury and cerebrovascular function during ExT in nondiabetic
and diabetic rats by examining responses of cerebral
arterioles to eNOS- and nNOS-dependent agonists.
METHODS
Induction of diabetes. All procedures were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Louisiana
State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport. Male Sprague-
Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN; 180–200 g
body wt) were randomly divided into one of four groups: sedentary
nondiabetic, ExT nondiabetic, sedentary diabetic, and ExT diabetic.
All rats had access to food and water ad libitum. The diabetic groups
of rats were injected with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg ip) to induce
diabetes, and the nondiabetic groups of rats were injected with vehicle
(sodium citrate buffer). Blood samples, for measurement of blood
glucose concentration, were obtained 3 days after injection of streptozotocin
or vehicle, and on the day of the experiment. Blood glucose
concentration was determined by using an Accu-Chek II Blood
Glucose Monitor (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). An animal with a blood glucose concentration of300 mg/dl on
samples obtained 3 days after injection of streptozotocin and on the
day of the experiment was considered to be diabetic.
ExT. Rats were subjected to modest levels of ExT using standard
techniques similar to that which our laboratory has described previously
(31). Treadmill exercise was started 3 days following injection
of streptozotocin or vehicle and was carried out 5 days/wk until the
day before the experiment. Experiments were conducted 6–8 wk after
starting the ExT. The length of time on the treadmill was initially
10–15 min/day for the first 5 days at 0% grade at a speed of 20–25
M/min. Then, over an 8- to 10-day period, the duration on the
treadmill was gradually increased to 60 min at a speed of 20–25

M/min. This level of ExT produces a similar increase in citrate
synthase activity in skeletal muscle of nondiabetic and T1D rats and
is considered modest in duration and intensity (30).
Transient focal cerebral ischemia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia
was performed using methods our laboratory has described
previously (45, 52, 53). On the day of the experiment, sedentary
nondiabetic (n  11), ExT nondiabetic (n  6), sedentary diabetic
(n  6), and ExT diabetic (n  6) rats were anesthetized with
ketamine (100 mg/kg ip)/xylazine (15 mg/kg ip). A laser Doppler flow
probe (PeriFlux System 5000; Perimed; Ardmore, PA) was attached to
the right side of the dorsal surface of the skull (2 mm caudal and 6 mm
lateral to the bregma). A 4–0 monofilament nylon suture was prepared
by rounding its tip by heating and coating with silicon. The right
common and external carotid arteries were exposed and ligated. The
middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by inserting the filament
from the basal area of the external carotid artery and advancing it
cranially into the internal carotid artery to the point where the MCA
branched from the internal carotid artery. Onset of MCA occlusion
(MCAO) was determined by a rapid drop in regional cerebral blood
flow, as measured by the laser Doppler. After occluding the MCA for
2 h, reperfusion was initiated by removing the suture. The rats were
allowed to recover for 24 h, when the evaluation of brain infarct
volume was determined.
Assessment of brain injury following MCAO. Following 24 h of
reperfusion, the rats were euthanized with Inactin (thiobutabarbital
sodium; 150 mg/kg ip). The brains were quickly removed and placed
in ice-cold saline for 5 min. The brains were then cut into six
2-mm-thick coronal sections. The sections were stained with 2%
2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 15 min at 37°C. Slice
images were digitalized, and the infarct lesion was evaluated using
Kodak Molecular Imaging Software (Eastman Kodak, Rochester,
NY). Complete lack of staining with TTC was defined as the infarct
lesion. The infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere. We measured the total infarct volume,
cortical infarct volume, and subcortical infarct volume in all groups of
rats. The investigator was blinded to the group of rat during the
measurement of infarct volume. Our laboratory has used these methods
in previous studies (45, 52).
In vivo reactivity of pial arterioles. Rats were prepared for in vivo
studies 6–8 wk after injection of streptozotocin or vehicle. Rats were
anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg IP). A tracheotomy was performed
and the animals were ventilated mechanically with room air
and supplemental oxygen. A catheter was inserted into a femoral vein
for injection of supplemental anesthesia, and a femoral artery was
cannulated for measurement of arterial pressure and to obtain a blood
sample for the measurement of blood glucose concentration. After
placement of all catheters, the animal was placed in a head holder, and
a craniotomy was made over the left parietal cortex to expose the pial
microcirculation (8). The cranial window was suffused with artificial
cerebral spinal fluid, at a temperature of 37 1°C, and bubbled with
95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. The cranial window was
connected via a three-way valve to an infusion pump, which allowed
for infusion of agonists into the suffusate. Arterial blood gases were
monitored and maintained within normal limits.
The cranial window was suffused for 30–45 min before responses
to the agonists were examined. Then we examined dilation of pial
arterioles in sedentary nondiabetic (n 5), ExT nondiabetic (n 9),
sedentary diabetic (n 6), and ExT diabetic (n 5) rats in response
to adenosine 5=-diphosphate (ADP; 10 and 100 M), N-methyl-D-
aspartic acid (NMDA; 100 and 300M), and nitroglycerin (0.1 and
1.0M). Agonists were mixed in artificial cerebral spinal fluid and
superfused over the cranial window preparation. Diameter of pial
arterioles was measured using a video image-shearing monitor (Instrumentation
for Physiology and Medicine, San Diego, CA). The
diameter of pial arterioles was measured immediately before the
application of agonists and every min for 5 min during application of
the agonists. Steady-state responses were reached within 2–3 min after
application, and the diameter of pial arterioles returned to baseline
within 5 min after application of the agonists was stopped.
Statistical analysis. Analysis of variance with Fisher’s test for
significance was used to compare infarct volumes, baseline diameter
of pial arterioles, responses of pial arterioles to the agonists, body
weight, blood glucose concentration, and mean arterial blood pressure
between sedentary and ExT nondiabetic and diabetic rats. A P value
of0.05 was considered to be significant.
Drugs and chemicals. Streptozotocin, ADP, ketamine, xylazine,
sodium citrate, Inactin, and TTC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Nitroglycerin was purchased from American Reagent
Laboratories (Shirley, NY).
RESULTS
Baseline conditions. Baseline diameter of pial arterioles and
mean arterial pressure were similar in all groups of rats (Table 1).
However, blood glucose concentration was significantly higher
in the diabetic groups of rats compared with the nondiabetic
groups, regardless of ExT (Table 1). Furthermore, body weight
was similar in sedentary and ExT nondiabetic rats, but was
significantly less in sedentary and ExT diabetic rats compared
with the nondiabetic rats (Table 1).
MCAO/reperfusion-induced brain injury. Total infarct volume
induced by a 2-h MCAO followed by 24 h of reperfusion
was greater in sedentary diabetic than in sedentary nondiabetic
rats (Fig. 1). In addition, total infarct volume was similar in
sedentary nondiabetic rats and ExT nondiabetic rats (Fig. 1). In
contrast, ExT decreased total infarct volume in diabetic rats
compared with sedentary diabetic rats (Fig. 1). Identification of
the location of the infarct revealed that both the cortical and
subcortical infarct volumes were increased in sedentary diabetic
rats, that ExT did not influence the distribution of the
infarct volumes in sedentary or ExT nondiabetic rats, and that
ExT prevented the increase in cortical and subcortical infarct
volumes in diabetic rats (Fig. 2).
Responses of pial arterioles. ADP- (Fig. 3) and NMDA-
induced (Fig. 4) dilation of pial arterioles was similar in
sedentary and ExT nondiabetic rats. In contrast, dilation of pial
arterioles in response to ADP (Fig. 3) and NMDA (Fig. 4) was
significantly less in sedentary diabetic rats compared with
sedentary and ExT nondiabetic rats (P 0.05). Furthermore,

we found that ExT reversed impaired vasodilation to ADP and
NMDA in diabetic rats to levels observed in sedentary and ExT
nondiabetic rats. Thus, eNOS- and nNOS-induced dilation of
pial arterioles is impaired in sedentary diabetic rats, and this is
reversed by ExT. In contrast to that observed with ADP and
NMDA, nitroglycerin produced similar dose-related dilation of
pial arterioles in all groups of rats (Fig. 5). These findings,
regarding the influence of ExT on vascular function, are similar
to what our laboratory has shown in a previous study (31).
DISCUSSION
The major new finding of the present study is that modest

fusion during T1D. In addition, this influence of ExT on infarct
volume following ischemia-reperfusion in diabetic rats is accompanied
by prevention of impaired eNOS- and nNOS-
dependent cerebrovascular function. Based on these findings,
we suggest that modest ExT has beneficial effects on the
cerebral microcirculation and may have significant therapeutic
potential for the prevention of diabetes-aggravated brain injury
following ischemic stroke.
Consideration of methods. Ischemic stroke accounts for
80–85% of all strokes. We used a model of transient focal
ischemia to determine whether ExT could influence brain
injury following ischemia-reperfusion in nondiabetic and diabetic
rats (53). This methodology uses a silicon-coated suture
to produce occlusion of the MCA that appears to be more
consistent than the poly-L-lysine-coated suture. Our laboratory
has shown previously that the poly-L-lysine-coated suture is
adequate in diameter to produce occlusion of the MCA, but
may lack suitable thickness in the trunk of the suture to allow
the MCA area to be supplied by the internal carotid and
posterior carotid arteries, thereby producing a more variable
infarct (53). In contrast, the silicon-coated suture can obstruct
all sources of blood flow from these arteries. Thus we suggest
that the use of this modified suture yields a more consistent
ischemic area/infarct volume, and we suggest that this model is
appropriate for the study of cerebral ischemic events.
We used treadmill exercise in nondiabetic and diabetic rats
to examine the influence of ExT on reactivity of cerebral
arterioles and on infarct volume following MCAO. We and
others have used the regimen for ExT described in the present
study to examine the influence of modest ExT on various
aspects of diabetes-induced diseases (30, 31, 41, 54). In previous
studies, our laboratory found that this modest level of
ExT prevented diabetes-induced alterations in vascular function
of large and small cerebral arterioles, without influencing
body weight or blood glucose concentration (30, 31). In addition
, studies by Shao et al. (41) reported that a similar level of
ExT, as used in the present study, produced a similar increase
in citrate synthase activity in ExT nondiabetic and T1D rats
(indicating that the degree of ExT was similar in nondiabetic
and T1D rats) and could attenuate cardiac dysregulation observed
in T1D rats, again without influencing body weight or
blood glucose levels in either nondiabetic or T1D rats. In
addition, these investigators (41) reported that there was no
difference in cardiac function between sedentary nondiabetic and
ExT nondiabetic rats, suggesting that the level of ExT was
modest, but still adequate, to influence parameters in T1D. Thus
we suggest that the regimen of ExT used in the present study may
be modest, but is adequate to influence cerebrovascular dysfunction
and brain injury following MCAO during T1D.
We used ADP and NMDA to examine eNOS- and nNOS-
dependent responses of cerebral arterioles, respectively. We
and others have shown that ADP dilates cerebral arterioles via
activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), presumably eNOS
(1, 9, 32). In addition, we and others have shown that NMDA
dilates cerebral arterioles via the activation of nNOS (10–12,
46). Based on these previous findings, we suggest that ADP
and NMDA are appropriate agonists to evaluate NOS-dependent
dilatation of cerebral arterioles.
Influence of diabetes on the incidence of stroke. Diabetes
(type 1 and type 2) is an important risk factor for cerebral
ischemia, and the risk for ischemic stroke is about twice as
much in a diabetic individual as in an individual without
diabetes (2, 22, 42). In addition, brain injury is increased, and
functional outcomes are worse following cerebral ischemia
during diabetes (3, 22, 34, 48). The mechanisms by which
diabetes contributes to an increase in the risk for cerebral
ischemia and brain injury following cerebral ischemia appear
to be related to hyperglycemia (3, 5, 23) and the consequences
of hyperglycemia, i.e., an increase in oxidative stress (26, 50).
Kusaka et al. (26) found that brain injury following cerebral
ischemia was increased in T1D rats due to the influence of
angiotensin II (via AT1 receptors) activating NADPH oxidase.
The findings of the present study are in agreement with and
extend the findings of Kusaka et al. (26). We found that
reactivity of cerebral arterioles was decreased in T1D rats, and
brain injury following cerebral ischemia was increased in T1D
rats. Furthermore, we found that ExT could reverse impaired
cerebrovascular reactivity and limit brain injury following
cerebral ischemia during T1D. Although we do not have
definitive information regarding the precise mechanism by

which ExT protects the brain during T1D, we speculate that
ExT may decrease oxidative stress (31).
Influence of ExT on the risk of stroke. A number of epidemiological
studies using human subjects have examined the
relationship between pre-ExT on the risk of ischemic stroke.
The findings from these studies have been mixed. Some studies
have reported that pre-ExT was associated with better functional
outcomes after having a stroke, a less severe level of
stroke, and/or a decrease in the occurrence of ischemic stroke
(6, 20, 24, 28, 40, 43). The mechanisms that contributed to the
protective effects of pre-ExT on functional outcomes/occurrence
of stroke are not entirely clear from these epidemiological
studies, but have been suggested to be related to effects of
pre-ExT on metabolic pathways, blood pressure, blood cholesterol
, glucose tolerance, and/or body weight. In contrast to
studies that have shown a protective influence of pre-ExT, a
recent prospective study has suggested that pre-ExT may decrease
the occurrence of ischemic stroke, but does not improve functional
outcomes following stroke (36). Thus, based on epidemiological
studies, it is difficult to provide a global statement
regarding the beneficial effects of pre-ExT on the pathogenesis
of stroke, but it appears that the majority of evidence suggests
that pre-ExT has a beneficial effect on both the occurrence and
functional outcomes of ischemic stroke.
Investigators also have examined the influence of pre- and
post-ExT on the pathogenesis of stroke using animal models.
Endres et al. (7) examined the influence of pre-ExT on eNOS
expression and ischemic injury in wild-type and eNOS/
mice. These investigators found that 3 wk of pre-ExT before
induction of MCAO could protect against cerebral ischemic
injury in wild-type mice, but not in eNOS/ mice, and
concluded that this protection was related to an increase in
eNOS activity. Others have examined the influence of post-
ExT on brain injury following cerebral ischemia. Cechetti et al.
(4) found that post-ExT following a cerebral ischemic event
could protect against cognitive dysfunction. The mechanism
for the protective effect of post-ExT was not precisely determined
, but was speculated to be related to an adaptive effect of
antioxidant pathways due to an increase in oxidative stress
produced by treadmill exercise. In another study, Zheng et al.
(55) found that post-ExT improved recovery of brain function
in rats following MCAO by a mechanism that appeared to be
related to an increase in the expression of angiopoietin-1 and/or
Tie-2, which influence neovascularization. Finally, a study by
Zhang et al. (51) found that post-ExT could improve brain
injury following MCAO by a mechanism that appeared to
promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus it appears that post-
ExT following the induction of an ischemic stroke can protect
against neurological dysfunction and brain injury. The present
study extends the findings of previous studies by demonstrating
a positive influence of pre-ExT on brain injury and cerebrovascular
function during T1D. However, we did not find a
significant beneficial effect of pre-ExT on cerebrovascular
reactivity or brain injury following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
in normal (nondiabetic) rats in the present study or in our
laboratory’s previous studies (30, 31), even though we found
an increase in eNOS protein in ExT nondiabetic rats (31). The
explanation for the discrepancy between the present study and
the study of Endres et al. (7) regarding the beneficial effects of
pre-ExT on brain injury following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
in normal (nondiabetic) animals is not clear, but may be
related to species differences (mice vs. rats) and/or differences
in the intensity and duration of ExT. Future studies will need to
examine the influence of intensity and duration of ExT on
cerebrovascular reactivity and brain injury following cerebral
ischemia.
Relationship between cerebrovascular reactivity and brain
injury following cerebral ischemia. We measured cerebrovascular
function and infarct volume in sedentary and ExT nondiabetic
and diabetic rats. We suggest that there may be a
relationship between altered cerebrovascular function and
brain infarct volume following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
During a transient focal cerebral ischemic event, the reduction
in blood flow from the arterial occlusion is greatest in the
center of the ischemic territory (ischemic core) and less at the
periphery of the ischemic core (ischemic penumbra) (53).
Following an ischemic stroke, cerebrovascular reactivity is
impaired (29, 33), thereby reducing the potential increases in
blood flow to the ischemic area by functional activation of
many components within brain tissue, i.e., a functional alteration
in the neurovascular unit. During a disease state such as
T1D, this condition may be amplified, given that vascular
function in response to eNOS- and nNOS-dependent stimuli is
compromised (31). In the present study, we found a significant
increase in the infarct volume in both the cortical and subcortical
regions of the brain in T1D rats that was restored to that
observed in nondiabetic rats by ExT. Thus it is conceivable
that, if there are preexisting alterations in cerebrovascular
function (i.e., the neurovascular unit) during T1D, that this
might influence the severity of the infarct volume following
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by limiting adequate cerebral
blood flow to the ischemia area.
In summary, we found that transient focal cerebral ischemia
produced a larger infarct volume in T1D rats compared with
nondiabetic rats. In addition, we found that ExT limited brain
injury following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in T1D rats.
Furthermore, we found that ExT restored impaired eNOS- and
nNOS-dependent dilation of cerebral arterioles in T1D rats, but
did not alter NOS-independent vasodilation. We speculate that
ExT may have a potential therapeutic value for the treatment of
T1D-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction and may be important
in the prevention of T1D-induced cerebrovascular abnormalities
, including the risk of ischemic stroke.
