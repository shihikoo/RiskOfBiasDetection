Abstract The presence of a native collateral circulation in
tissues lessens injury in occlusive vascular diseases. However
, differences in genetic background cause wide variation
in collateral number and diameter in mice, resulting in
large variation in protection. Indirect estimates of collateral
perfusion suggest that wide variation also exists in humans.
Unfortunately, methods used to obtain these estimates are
invasive and not widely available. We sought to determine
whether differences in genetic background in mice result in
variation in branch patterning of the retinal arterial circulation
, and whether these differences predict strain-dependent
differences in pial collateral extent and severity of
ischemic stroke. Retinal patterning metrics, collateral
extent, and infarct volume were obtained for 10 strains
known to differ widely in collateral extent. Multivariate
regression was conducted, and model performance was
assessed using K-fold cross-validation. Twenty-one
metrics varied with strain (p\ 0.01). Ten metrics (e.g.,
bifurcation angle, lacunarity, optimality) predicted collateral
number and diameter across seven regression models,
with the best model closely predicting (p\ 0.0001) number
(±1.2–3.4 collaterals, K-fold R2 = 0.83–0.98), diameter
(±1.2–1.9 lm, R2 = 0.73–0.88), and infarct volume
(±5.1 mm3, R2 = 0.85–0.87). An analogous set of the
most predictive metrics, obtained for the middle cerebral
artery (MCA) tree in a subset of the above strains, also
predicted (p\ 0.0001) collateral number (±3.3 collaterals
, K-fold R2 = 0.78) and diameter (±1.6 lm, R2 =
0.86). Thus, differences in arterial branch patterning in
the retina and the MCA trees are specified by genetic
background and predict variation in collateral extent and
stroke severity. If also true in human, and since genetic
variation in cerebral collaterals extends to other tissues at
least in mice, a similar ‘‘retinal predictor index’’ could
serve as a non- or minimally invasive biomarker for
collateral extent in brain and other tissues. This could
aid prediction of severity of tissue injury in the event of
an occlusive event or development of obstructive disease
and in patient stratification for treatment options and
clinical studies.

Introduction
Occlusive vascular disease in brain, heart, and peripheral
limbs is caused by atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and other
disorders and imposes large social and economic burdens.
Although available treatment options (e.g., thrombolysis,
thrombectomy, angioplasty/stent, bypass grafting) are
successful in many patients, time window for treatment,
comorbidities, inaccessibility, and diffuse obstructions
exclude large numbers of patients. Irrespective of treatment
availability or type, an abundant collateral circulation
greatly reduces morbidity and mortality in these diseases
[1, 2]. Collaterals are native (preexisting) arteriole-toarteriole
anastomoses that cross-connect a small fraction of
the outer branches of adjacent arterial trees and are present
in most tissues. When the trunk of one of the trees becomes
obstructed, collateral-dependent retrograde perfusion significantly
decreases tissue injury. The amount of protection
depends primarily on the extent (i.e., number and diameter)
of collaterals present, plus the perfusion pressure across the
collateral network and vascular resistance above and below
it [3, 4].
The major determinants of severity of ischemic stroke
are site of occlusion within the tree, time to endovascular
revascularization when this is an option, and collateral
blood flow. Unfortunately, collateral perfusion varies
widely among individuals in brain, heart, lower extremities
, and other tissues. For example, in patients with
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the most
common cause of ischemic stroke, collateral-dependent
perfusion of the MCA tree—which can be graded (scored)
by neuroimaging—varies widely, with approximately
20 % having poor pial (leptomeningeal) collateral scores
(i.e., poor collateral ‘‘status’’) [1, 5–9]. Notably, such
individuals sustain larger infarct volumes, respond poorly
to thrombolytic treatments, have increased risk of and
severity of intracerebral hemorrhage, and suffer increased
morbidity and mortality [1, 5–9]. Recent studies have
confirmed a similar wide variation in collateral blood flow
in other tissues among ‘‘healthy’’ humans, i.e., without
obstructive disease in the tissue under examination. In
individuals without angiographically detectable coronary
artery disease (CAD), collateral flow index (CFI) was
distributed normally and varied by *25-fold, with
approximately 20 % of individuals having low CFIs [10].
Importantly, patients with CAD and poor CFIs had 64 %
higher risk of mortality [2]. CFI also varied significantly in
the lower extremities of individuals without peripheral
artery disease (PAD) [11]. Thus, assessing collateral status
is increasingly regarded as an important means to identify
optimal treatment and to assess prognosis for recovery [1,
2, 5–9].
The mechanisms responsible for the wide variation in
collateral status are unknown. However, recent studies in
mice indicate that genetic background may be a major
factor. Pial collateral extent was found to vary, remarkably,
by 56-fold among 21 healthy adult strains with naturally
occurring differences in genetic background and was
associated with a 30-fold variation in infarct volume after
MCA occlusion [3, 12, 13]. Moreover, a single polymorphic
locus on chromosome 7, denoted ‘‘Determinant of
collateral extent-1’’ (Dce1), has since been identified that is
critical in the pathway controlling collaterogenesis in the
embryo and thus accounts for most of the above variation
in the index strains [14]. In that study, the at-risk allele of
Dce1 in the strain with poor collaterals was replaced with
the allele from the strain with abundant collaterals. This
restored the poor collateral phenotype to nearly that in the
good strain: 83 % correction of low pial collateral extent,
and—after MCA occlusion—a 4.5-fold improvement in
blood flow, and 85 % reduction in infarct volume; similar
effects were achieved in skeletal muscle, resulting in 83 %
improvement in recovery of hindlimb perfusion after
femoral artery ligation. Thus, ischemia, tissue injury, and
infarct volume were strongly reduced by exchanging a
single discrete locus. Although the causative genetic element
(s) at Dce1 has not yet been identified, the candidate
genes have been narrowed to a small number [14]. Whether

human DCE1 and/or related loci are responsible for the
wide variation in collateral status in humans is under
investigation [15].
A critical problem is that no noninvasive method exists
for determining the extent of the collateral circulation in
healthy humans or patients with obstructive disease. Since
the diameters of most native collaterals are below the
resolution of clinical imaging modalities, measurement of
pial collateral score in acute stroke is used to indirectly
estimate conductance of the collateral network. This
method requires administration of a contrast agent and thus
is invasive. It also relies on advanced neuroimaging not
available at most treatment centers. Estimation of collateral-dependent
perfusion in heart and lower extremities
requires temporary intra-arterial balloon occlusion, which
generally restricts its use to experimental studies [10, 11].
Thus, a noninvasive method or biomarker that predicts
collateral extent would be an important development.
Recent studies in mice have found that genetic differences
in pial collateral extent are established late during gestation
[16, 17] and have noted a possible association with differences
evident at the same time in the branch patterning
of the MCA tree, with both differences being sustained in
the adult [16]. This apparent association of collateral extent
with arterial tree geometry is also evident, at least qualitatively
, in another tissue—skeletal muscle [18–23]. This
suggests that naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms
that cause differences in collateral extent may also cause
differences in arterial tree patterning. This opens up the
possibility that analysis of arterial tree arborization in a
tissue amenable to noninvasive imaging could be used to
predict the extent of the collateral circulation in the brain
and other tissues, since genetic-dependent variation in pial
collaterals extends to variation in other tissues in the same
individual, at least in mice [4, 14, 18–21, 23].
The retinal circulation stands alone as a candidate tissue.
It is arranged in two-dimensions which aids geometric
analysis and can be imaged directly and noninvasively in
humans. Moreover, sophisticated methods have been
developed for quantifying the geometry of its branch patterning
[24–30]. In addition, it is well known that formation
of the retinal and neocortical vasculatures shares many
anatomic similarities during development and maturation
[25], as well as structural and topographic changes that
occur with aging, cardio/cerebrovascular diseases, and
hereditary angiopathies [23–29]. Unfortunately, since the
inner retinal circulation in human [25] and mouse (confirmed
herein) lacks collaterals, it is not possible to simply
quantify collaterals in retina to determine whether their
number and diameter predict collateral extent in brain and
other tissues.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether
branch patterning of retinal arterial trees varies with
genetic background and correlates with differences in pial
collateral extent and, in turn, infarct volume following
MCA occlusion. We tested this hypothesis in a genetically
diverse cohort of mice previously shown to have wide
differences in collateral extent [3, 4, 16, 18–20]. A comprehensive
set of previously reported retinal patterning
metrics was examined, together with identification of
several novel and more predictive metrics that define
genetic-dependent retinal vascular complexity. Multivariate
stepwise regression modeling was used to analyze the
data in an unbiased manner. K-fold regression analysis was
then used to reduce statistical bias and simulate external
validation, thus improving the validity of the results. We
also examined the same question for branch patterning of
the MCA tree, to determine whether the findings in retina
extend to another tissue and thus offer insights into the
underlying mechanism for the association.
Methods
An expanded Materials and Methods section is available in
the Online Supplemental Material.
Pial collateral number and diameter, retinal vascular
imaging, infarct volume, MCA imaging
The number and average diameter of pial collaterals (COL-N,
COL-D) that cross-connect the MCA and anterior cerebral
artery (ACA) trees of both hemispheres were obtained as
detailed elsewhere [3] from a population of*3-month-old
male mice (n = 81,*8 per strain) composed of 10 strains that
differ widely in collateral extent (Fig. 1)[ 3, 4, 16, 18–20].We
have previously found no sexual dimorphism for geneticdependent
differences in pial collateral number and diameter
in different strains of classic inbred, F1 or F2 crossed, or
congenic mice [4, 14, 61]. The deficient strains were VEGFAlo/?, A/J, AKR/J, CLIC4 -/-, and BALB/cByJ; the abundant
strains were C57BLKS/J, DBA/2 J, VEGFAhi/?, C57Bl/
6 J, and the CD1/CR strain (background strain for VEGFAlo/?,
VEGFAhi/?, and CLIC4-/-). The strains VEGFAlo/?,
CLIC4-/-, VEGFhi/?, and CD1 are closely related, although
the gene targeted strains were generated from separate lines
of CD1 which itself is maintained outbred [19, 20]. We
selected them as part of the 10-strain population because we
have shown previously that VEGF-A and CLIC4 are
important in collaterogenesis, which occurs late in gestation
and early postnatally and are thus determinants of collateral
number and diameter in adult and infarct volume after middle
cerebral artery ligation and severity of hindlimb ischemia after
femoral artery ligation; these proteins also regulate formation
and patterning vessels of the general arterio-venous circulation
[19, 20 and references therein]. That is, these strains

provided additional strains, besides the six classic inbred
strains, with low, intermediate, and high collateral number and
diameter in their tissues. Although C57BL/6 J (B6) and
C57BLKS/J are also closely related genealogically, approximately
71 % of the latter’s genome derives from B6, 25 %
from DBA/2 J and 4 % from C57BL/10 J, a 129 source and an
unidentified source(s) (http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/000662.
html). Before the above procedures, one retina was collected
from each mouse, flat-mounted, and stained (Alexafluor 568
GS-IB4). Other mice of the above strains received permanent
occlusion of the right MCA trunk (MCAO), followed by
determination of infarct volume 24 h later using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride staining [14]. For the MCA study,
the MCA artery tree was imaged as described previously [3]in
5–6 mice of a subset of the above strains (AKR/J, BALB/
cByJ, C57BLKS/J, and C57Bl/6 J). Different mice were used
for the retina and MCA studies.
Vascular patterning metrics
We obtained 22 retinal patterning metrics (RPMs) to
define complexity of the retinal artery trees. The metrics
were determined in an inner-zone region extending from
the optic disk margin and an outer-zone region extending
from there to the retinal periphery (Figs. 2, 3, Online
Figure 1). The RPMs included several commonly used
metrics [24–30], e.g., vessel caliber, branch angle, central
retinal artery and vein equivalent (CRAE and CRVE),
artery-to-vein ratio (AVR), optimality, arterial tree area,
fractal dimension, and lacunarity (Fig. 1, Online Table 1,
Online Figure 2). We also measured additional RPMs that
identify distribution (average, skewness, and kurtosis) of
length and tortuosity of branch segments. Measurements
were limited to arterial trees because a preliminary analysis
showed that the capillary bed, venous trees, and the
distal-most arteriole branches beyond the fourth-order
level lacked detectable strain-dependent differences in
patterning and thus increased the noise in the data (Online
Figures 3–5). A subset of the above metrics that were
found to be most predictive in the retina study was
obtained in the MCA study using the same methods for
deriving the metrics as described below. All mice were
coded to assure that investigators remained blinded to
mouse strain and collateral extent until all measurements
had been obtained.
Image analysis
Three arterial trees were randomly chosen for each retina
among the 5–7 trees present (Research Randomizer, www.
randomizer.org). Ten RPMs were manually obtained from
the inner zone between the optic disk margin and innerzone
margin, and the latter defined as lying at 1/10th and
5/10th of the outer-zone margin (Fig. 2). The remaining 12
RPMs (Fig. 3) were obtained after binarization of the
arterial trees (Online Figure 3), followed by semiautomatic

application of ImageJ functions, a skeletonize plugin [31],
and a MATLAB algorithm for measuring fractal dimension
and lacunarity. A highly customizable macro-recorder
(https://www.jitbit.com/macro-recorder/) was used to create
a variety of repetitive sequences of ImageJ commands
and plugins followed by data-transfers to Microsoft Excel.
The MATLAB code used to calculate fractal dimension
and lacunarity is in Online Appendix 1. These action
sequences were looped to allow more efficient acquisition
of data from batches of a large number of images in a
semiautomatic fashion. Preliminary results from 20 mice (5
each from 4 strains) indicated that analyzing two randomly
chosen trees provided an optimal trade-off between accuracy
and time required for image binarization (Online
Figure 6). Therefore, images were background-corrected
using Photoshop CS5, and for the remaining 61 mice, two
instead of three arterial trees from each retina were randomly
chosen, binarized, and capillaries, and branches
beyond the fourth-order vessel level were removed (Online
Figure 3). RPMs across all measured arterial trees for a
given retina were averaged.
Study design and statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in JMP 9.0 (SAS, Cary,
NC) and Microsoft Excel 2010 (Fig. 4A). After obtaining
COL-N, COL-D, and the 22 RPMs for each mouse, an outlier 
analysis was conducted using Mahalanobis, T-squared, and

branch angle, tortuosity index (inner zone), central retinal artery

GS-IB4) retina is imported into Photoshop CS4 (panel A). A circle
centered on the optic disk and positioned over the outer-zone margin of
the retina (OZ) is drawn so its circumference is tangential to the
marginal veins (MV) along a majority of the flaps. The optic disk
margin (OD) and inner-zone margins (IZ) are drawn at 1/10th and
5/10th of the OZ diameter. The borders of the retina are traced to
measure the retinal area (RPM 10). All remaining manually obtained
RPMs (numbers 1–4, 8, 9) are measured in the region lying between the
OD and IZ from four randomly chosen arterial trees (yellow dashed
boxes). To calculate inner-zone tortuosity index (RPM 4), a line (l) is 
traced on each tree along the vessel axis from the OD to IZ margin and a
vector line (L) is drawn connecting the endpoints (B). A circle with a
25-pixel radius is manually placed encircling each branch point along
the tree between OD and IZ. The center of Bc is approximately placed at
the point of intersection (P) of the vessel axes of the parent and larger
branch. Vessel diameters (parent-D0, smaller branch-D1, larger
branch-D2) are measured perpendicular to the axis and used to calculate
the optimality ratio; (RPM 9) branch angle is the angle of the rays
bisecting the diameters (C). The above methods ensure consistent
measurement of RPMs. All numbers obtained from the four trees are
averaged to obtain a mean of each RPM for each mouse. CRAE and
CRVE are measured using the revised Parr–Hubbard formulas* [29, 30]
and combined to obtain AVR. Using ImageJ, vessel calibers of retinal
arterioles and venules were measured between 0.5 and one optic disk
diameters from the OD and summarized into the CRAE and CRVE (D).
Six of the largest arterioles and six of the largest venules are identified,
and using an iterative procedure, the largest and smallest calibers are
paired and entered into their respective formulas to obtain three vessel
calibers (E). This procedure is repeated to obtain two and finally one
central vessel equivalent, i.e., the CRAE and CRVE and AVR (RPMs

jackknife distances, resulting in identification of one common 
outlier (Fig. 4B).ANOVAwasthenusedtodeterminewhether
RPMs vary with COL-N, COL-D, and genetic background
(Fig. 5). Finally, to test the hypothesis that RPMs predict COLN
and COL-D, stepwise, multivariate regression modeling was
performed on the 80 remaining mice using three different
stopping rules [minimum Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC), minimum Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and
p value cutoffs] in forward, backward, and mixed directions to
obtain a set of seven regression models for both COL-N and
COL-D (RM1) (Online Figure 7). As an additional outlier
analysis, mice with a significantly high Cook’s D influence
across RM1 of both COL-N and COL-D were identified and 
excluded (Fig. 4C). The aforementioned modeling process was
then repeated to obtain two additional sets of regression models
(RM2 and RM3) (Online Figure 7). Leave-one-out K-fold
cross-validation was performed [32] for all 21 models for COLN
and COL-D to test predictive performance (Online Figure 7).
In addition, direction and significance of independent correlation
of predictive RPMs were c ompared across all models
(Online Figure 7). The most predictive models for COL-N and
COL-D were further examined to: (1) determine comparative
predictive ability of individual RPMs as assessed by magnitude
of scaled parameters and orthogonalized estimates (Fig. 6)and
(2) to obtain a formula—the Retinal Predictor Index—for
collateral number and diameter (RPI
n
and RPI
d
). To aid presentation
of the relationships that were identified, retinal and
pial images of two mice with a wide difference in COL-N and
COL-D were visually compared with values of the most predictive
metrics (Fig. 7). To test whether RPMs predict severity
of stroke following MCAO, performance of RPI
n
and RPI
d
for
the different mouse strains was evaluated for prediction of
infarct volume (Fig. 8).
Results
Patterning metrics of retinal arterial trees correlate
strongly with genetic background-dependent
differences in collateral number and diameter
To test the hypothesis that retinal artery tree geometry
varies with genetic background, we performed a bivariate
regression (ANOVA) of COL-N, COL-D, and RPMs
across the 10 mouse strains (Fig. 5A, Online Table 1,

Fig. 3 Measurement and definitions of semiautomatically obtained
retinal patterning metric (RPM) numbers 11–22. Each artery tree was
binarized using ImageJ (A) and skeletonized using the Analyze Skeleton
plugin (B)[ 31]. Each tree is composed of branch segments defined as the
length of tree lying between two branch points (B). Functions within
ImageJ are used to obtain RPMs 13 and 14 from the binarized image,
while the skeletonize plugin is used to calculate scalar length (l), vector
length (L), and tortuosity of each branch segment (B). Distributions
(average, skew, and kurtosis) of these values are calculated using
Microsoft Excel to obtain RPMs 17–22 for each arterial tree (C, D).
A MATLAB program is used to calculate fractal dimension and
lacunarity using the sliding box-count method (E). All numbers obtained
from the 2–3 randomly chosen trees (Online Figure 1) are averaged to
obtain a mean of each RPM for each mouse

strongly associated with genetic background (adjusted R2
of 0.86 and 0.87), confirming previous findings [3, 4, 16,
18–20]. Consistent with the above hypothesis, 10 of the 22
RPMs varied strongly with genetic background (adjusted
R2[ 0.35 and p\ 0.0001) (Fig. 5A), suggesting that,
similar to the variation in COL-N and COL-D (Fig. 1),
differences in genetic background cause significant differences
in retinal arterial tree patterning. This is confirmed
by multivariate correlation matrices (Fig. 5B, C),which
show that many RPMs have a strong and significant correlation
with COL-N and COL-D. These data support the
hypothesis that RPMs predict collateral extent in the brain.
However, the correlation matrices show that certain RPMs
are also correlated with other RPMs. Thus, to test the
predictive hypothesis, a stepwise, multivariate regression
modeling approach was required to adjust for covariates,
obtain a refined set of the most predictive RPMs, and
eliminate any redundant metrics.
Genetic-dependent differences in patterning of retinal
arterial trees predict differences in pial collateral
number and diameter
To determine which RPMs and in what combination most
strongly predict COL-N and COL-D, we performed stepwise
, multivariate regression modeling (Online Figure 7).

Collateral number and diameter (COL-N and COL-D) and 22 RPMs
were obtained from 81 mice [(panel A) and Figs. 1, 2, 3, Online
Table 1, Online Figure 1]. A preliminary multivariate outlier analysis
of all observations found one mouse with significantly high Mahalanobis
, jackknife, and T2 distances (panels A, B). Bivariate
regression (A) of COL-N, COL-D, and RPMs was performed on
the remaining 80 mice to determine degree and significance of
covariance and correlation with genetic strain (Fig. 5). Forward,
backward, and mixed-direction stepwise, multivariate regression
modeling of RPMs versus COL-N and COL-D was performed using
three different criteria—minimum AIC and BIC, and p value
cutoffs—to obtain seven different models (RM1) (n = 80) (Online
Figure 7). A K-fold R2 value for each model was obtained using
leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the average predictive
performance of the modeling process for each of the seven models
repeated n-times (correlation between actual and predicted COL-N or
COL-D for a given model developed on n-1 observations) (Online
Figure 7). Observations with significantly high Cook’s D influence
averaged across RM1 of COL-N and COL-D, COL-N, or COL-D
models were identified (C) and excluded to repeat the aforementioned
modeling process (RM2 and RM3) [(A) and Online Figure 7]. The
most predictive models for COL-N and COL-D (i.e., combination of
RPMs) among RM1, RM2, and RM3 were used to obtain a retinal
predictive index—RPI
n
and RPI
d
, respectively (Fig. 6). Performance
of the average RPI

for each strain in predicting historic
average infarct volume for each strain was tested (Fig. 8). In the

confidence interval of the mean; the ends of the box represent the 25th

interquartile range (IQR) of the data; the box-lines that extend from
the top and bottom end of the box (whiskers) represent the first Q-
1.5 (IQR) and third Q? 1.5 (IQR), respectively. The bracket outside

(0.73–0.83 for COL-N and 0.59–0.73 for COL-D). This
supports the hypotheses that genetic background plays a
significant role in specifying retinal patterning and that
RPMs can be used to predict genetic differences in COL-N
and COL-D. Removal of outliers did not change this conclusion
: K-fold R2 for COL-N and COL-D only improved
by an average of*0.05 and 0.02 for RM2 and*0.09 and
0.1 for RM3 (Online Figure 7). In addition, all seven models
showed a similarly strong predictive performance and a
nearly identical set of RPMs that were consistently predictive
in the same direction, i.e., nine RPMs for COL-N, of
which seven were also predictive for COL-D. This verifies
that the findings were not dependent on or biased by a
particular modeling approach. Lacunarity and CRAE were
the two RPMs that predicted COL-N but not COL-D. Lacunarity
only became a significant predictor across all
models after removal of outliers (RM2 and RM3), and
CRAE was only predictive in four models. These results are
consistent with our finding that lacunarity and CRAE only
minimally contribute to predictive performance, in comparison
with the other predictors (Fig. 6). Only one of two
RPMs for distribution of a metric—skewness and kurtosis
of distribution of branch segment lengths—reached predictive
significance across all models (i.e., kurtosis) (Online
Figure 7), a finding that is attributable to the strong
covariance and redundancy of the two RPMs (Fig. 5B).

Fig. 5 Retinal patterning metrics (RPMs) vary with genetic background
and correlate with collateral number (COL-N), diameter
(COL-D), and other RPMs. Bivariate regression (one-way ANOVA
adjusted R2 and p value) of COL-N, COL-D, and RPMs versus mouse
strain (panel A) shows that COL-N, COL-D, and 10 out of 22 RPMs
strongly vary with genetic background (black columns, relative
strength of correlation; red dashed line, adjusted R2 of [ 0.35,
p\ 0.0001). These data suggest that, similar to its contribution to the
variation in COL-N and COL-D, genetic background also plays a
significant role in specifying variation in features of retinal vascular
patterning, such as vessel caliber, branch angle, etc. Multivariate
correlation matrices (B, C) of COL-N, COL-D, and RPMs show
significant covariance; matrices show direction and strength
[±adjusted R2 (B)], and significance [p value, (C)] of covariance.
Highlighted regions of matrices (B, C; yellow boxes) show that a
number of RPMs (1–3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13–15, 17, 20) also vary strongly
with COL-N and COL-D, suggesting that they may also predict
collateral extent. Fractal dimension and lacunarity (RPMs 11 and 12),
global descriptors of pattern complexity, both correlate with other
RPMs and are inversely related to each other (B, C; orange boxes)

estimates (i.e., estimates that are set to a common relative
scale and independent of other metrics after elimination
of covariance) of the most strongly correlated
RPMs arising from the most predictive models (identified
in Online Figure 7) for COL-N and COL-D (Fig. 6). The
scaled estimates (Fig. 6A, C) show relative amount of
change in COL-N or COL-D (in raw values) that is
expected when a specific RPM changes from its lowest
to highest value in the data set. However, scaled estimates
only provide limited information because of
covariance between certain RPMs (Fig. 5B) and because
the metrics have unequal ranges and variances in the
mouse cohort [e.g., optimality and fractal dimension
(FD) show less variation compared to vessel caliber
(Online Figure 2)]. Pareto plots (Figs. 6B, D) improve
the assessment of relative predictive power because they
also standardize and orthogonalize the RPMs so that they
have equal variances and are uncorrelated. Accordingly,
the average diameter of the larger branch vessel after a
branch point (D2) is the strongest predictor of collateral
extent, followed closely by average length of branch
segments, and retinal area. Other predictive metrics in
the model, e.g., parent vessel caliber (D0), optimality
ratio (a measure inversely related to equitability of distribution
of blood flow from a trunk to daughter vessels
at bifurcations), kurtosis of distribution (i.e., ‘‘peakedness
’’ of distribution or ‘‘self-similarity’’) of branch
segment lengths, branch angle at bifurcations, retinal
area, lacunarity, and CRAE—although not strong contributors
individually—together capture additional unique
information that approximately doubles the net predictive
ability beyond the three most predictive metrics. Thus,
the combination of these nine features of retinal patterning
strongly predicts genetic variation in collateral
number and diameter. These RPMs were then combined
with the most predictive models to obtain a formula—the
Retinal Predictor Index—for collateral number and
diameter (RPI
n
and RPI

) that were then found to be

Fig. 6 Among the most predictive RPMs, average diameter of larger
branch vessel at a arterial tree bifurcation along the length of the retinal
arteries emanating from the optic disk (D2) contributes the most
statistically to predicting collateral number and diameter (COL-N and
COL-D). To compare the relative predictive power of the RPMs,
parameter estimates from the two most predictive models for RPI
n
and
RPI
d
(Online Figure 7) were obtained and plotted as scaled estimates
(i.e., centered by mean and normalized to have identical range) (A, C);
in addition, the parameter estimates were standardized to have equal
variances, orthogonalized to be uncorrelated, and plotted—in
descending order of scaled estimates—as a Pareto plot (B, D). The
scaled estimates show the relative extent of change in COL-N or COL-D
as a specific RPM is varied from the lowest to highest value in the
population of mice. The Pareto plot accounts for covariance and extent
of variability of an RPM in the mouse population to estimate and arrange
the RPMs in descending order of relative ‘‘explanatory power.’’ Plots of

collaterals, K-fold R2 = 0.83, p\ 0.0001) and diameter
(±1.9 lm, 0.73, p\ 0.0001) in each mouse (Fig. 6E, F).
Figure 7 combines retinal and pial images with RPM
data from two mice that varied widely in collateral number
(27 versus 0), to address the degree to which visual versus
quantitative differences in retinal patterning correlate with
differences in collateral number. Consistent with the models
’ predictive power, a mouse with no collaterals had a
predicted COL-N of 0.5, lower values for vessel calibers
(D0, D2), branch angles at branch points, retinal area, and
CRAE, but higher lacunarity, longer branch segments, and
higher optimality. However, this mouse had a lower kurtosis
of distribution of branch segment lengths (i.e., lower proportion
of branch segments with similar lengths)—a finding
that is inconsistent with prediction and attributable to biological
variance and experimental error. Also consistent
with quantitative differences, the mouse with no collaterals
had more acute branch angles, a smaller retinal area, lower
vessel caliber overall, less vessel complexity, and fewer
branch segments. On the other hand, visual differences in
CRAE, optimality, and kurtosis of distribution of branch
segment lengths were less evident. Thus, the comparisons in
Fig. 7, showing that visual differences in retinal vascular
patterning are subtle in mice with even wide differences in
COL-N and COL-D, underscore the need for precise
quantitative measurements and multivariate regression
modeling in order to predict differences in collateral extent.
Retinal artery tree geometry predicts infarct volume
Previous studies have shown that differences in collateral
extent are closely associated with (Fig. 1) [ 3, 19, 20, 23]—
and causal for [14]—differences in severity of stroke following
middle cerebral artery occlusion. Given that genetic
variation in retinal geometry strongly predicts variation in

in retina). ‘‘Trees,’’ regions of retinal arterial trees (three large boxes
in retina). Values of predictive retinal metrics for the two mice are
shown for comparison. Consistent with the retinal prediction
modeling (Fig. 6), the mouse with a high COL-N (27) has a higher
RPI
n
(25.6), larger branch vessel caliber (D2), branch angles at branch
points, retinal area, and CRAE, but lower lacunarity, shorter branch
segments, and lower optimality (i.e., more equitable distribution of
vessel calibers of daughter vessels at bifurcations). However, contrary
to expectations, this mouse had a larger kurtosis of distribution of
branch segment lengths (i.e., higher proportion of branch segments
with similar lengths) and larger parent vessel caliber (D0) attributable
to both biological variance and experimental error

collateral extent (Fig. 6), we hypothesized that RPMs will
also predict infarct volume (Fig. 8), using the RPI
n
and
RPI
d
derived from the above analysis. This test for association
with infarct volume was necessarily conducted on a
strain-wise basis, because infarct volumes for the 10 strains
(Fig. 1) were a combination of historic data [3, 19, 20] plus
addition of more animals in VEGFhi/?, VEGFlo/?, and
BALB/c strains. Average RPIs for the 10 mouse strains
strongly predicted average COL-N and COL-D (K-fold R2
of 0.98 and 0.88, Fig. 8A). As suggested from our previous
studies [3, 19, 20, 23], average COL-N and COL-D among
the strains strongly predicted infarct volume among the
same strains (K-fold R2 of 0.78 and 0.75, Fig. 8B); these
values are similar to those obtained with linear correlation
of collateral number and diameter against infarct volume
across 15 mouse strains (R2 = 0.80 and 0.71, respectively)
[3]. Importantly, average values for RPI
n
and RPI
d
among
the strains thus strongly predicted average infarct volumes
(K-fold R2 of 0.85 and 0.87, Fig. 8C).
The flow scheme at the top of Fig. 8 derives from three
observations: The data in panel A show that the average
RPI for collateral number and diameter correlates closely
with, i.e., ‘‘predicts (A),’’ the measured collateral number
and diameter among the 10 strains. The data in panel B
show that average collateral number and diameter also
correlate well with, i.e., ‘‘predicts (B),’’ the measured
infarct volume. These data also agree strongly with data
obtained in a previous study of 15 classic inbred strains (six
of which were also studied in the present study) where
infarct volume yielded correlation coefficients for collateral
number and diameter (R2 = 0.80, p\ 0.0001 and
R2 = 0.71, p\ 0.0001, respectively) [3] very similar to
those obtained in the present study (0.78 and 0.75).
Moreover, the present study confirms the conclusion
reached previously [3] that variations in pial collateral
number and diameter are major determinants of variation in
the severity of infarct volume. These data and conclusion
agree with the observation that infarct volume in patients

with acute ischemic stroke is correlated with collateral
status/score—an index of collateral-dependent flow whose
major determinants are number and diameter of the pial
collateral network serving the occluded territory [1, 5–9].
The data in panel C validate the inference that the RPI for
collateral number and diameter therefore predict well
(R2 = 0.85 and 0.87) the actual measured infarct volume.
Relationship of fractal dimension and lacunarity
with Euclidean metrics
Fractal dimension and lacunarity are global, non-Euclidean
dimensionless metrics that have been used to define complexity
of the retinal vasculature in association studies [24,
25, 27, 34]. However, how they relate to geometric measures
of retinal arterial tree patterning has not been determined.
Since we found that differences in fractal dimension
and lacunarity were associated with differences in the other
patterning metrics (Fig. 5B, C; orange boxed-in metrics),
our data set offered a unique opportunity to identify, in a
complex vascular branching network, the relationship
between these global metrics and the Euclidean metrics
which are more intuitive and visualizable. No such analysis
is extant in the literature. Online Figure 8a–i shows the
association between RPMs and fractal dimension and lacunarity.
As with our prior analysis, we performed forward
and backward stepwise, multivariate regression modeling
of fractal dimension and lacunarity versus RPMs using a
variety of criteria as detailed in Online Figure 7. Average
fractal dimension and lacunarity of retinal artery trees
(dependent variables) from the 80 mice that were used
above were modeled with other RPMs (independent variables
). Significance of RPMs for a given model and their
strength of association with fractal dimension and lacunarity
, as measured by K-fold R2, were identified as detailed
in Fig. 6 and Online Figure 7. Among RPMs that characterize
retinal arterial tree complexity, high fractal dimension
and low lacunarity were most strongly associated with
differences in large vessel caliber (CRAE) and shorter and
more tortuous branch segments, respectively.
Fractal dimension did not emerge as a significant
predictor of COL-N and COL-D across most models
(Online Figure 7), and lacunarity only moderately predicted
COL-N (Fig. 6B). The reasons for this become
evident from the inspection of orthogonalized (uncorrelated
, equal variance) metrics (Online Figure 8a–i), where
it can be seen that these measures encompass contributions
from multiple other patterning metrics that correlated
either positively or negatively with collateral
number and diameter (Online Figure 7). Additional likely
contributions to their low predictive power are the narrow
range of fractal dimension (1.41–1.54), high covariance of
it, and lacunarity with other RPMs (Fig. 5B, orange
boxed-in metrics), many of which defined more specific
independent features of arterial tree complexity and thus
emerged as stronger predictors of collateral number and
diameter. These findings aid interpretation of previous
studies and design of future studies using fractal dimension
and lacunarity.
Middle cerebral artery tree analysis
Patterning of the MCA tree and arterial trees in skeletal
muscle of C57Bl/6 mice differs qualitatively from BALB/c
mice—strains with large differences in collateral number
and diameter in these and other tissues [3, 4, 16, 18, 22,
23]. Given the above findings in the retina, we wondered
whether patterning in another tissue would evidence similar
differences and correlate with/predict differences in pial
collateral extent. We studied the MCA because it can be
imaged in its entirety and in quasi-2-dimension without
dissection of the brain, is the largest of the cerebral artery
trees, and is cross-connected to the ACA and posterior
cerebral artery (PCA) trees by the pial collaterals whose
variation in extent is the subject of this study.
In agreement with previous qualitative observations
[3, 4, 16, 18, 22, 23], genetic-dependent differences in
arborization of the MCA tree were also evident among a
subset of the 10 mouse strains (BALB/c, C57BLKS, AKR
and C57BL/6), when examined for the same predictive
metrics that were identified in retina. However, many of the
RPMs and MCA patterning metrics correlated poorly or not
at all in bivariate regression against the same metrics in
retina (Online Figure 9)—findings which also undoubtedly
reflect the smaller number of strains and fewer animals per
strain analyzed. Nonetheless, multivariate regression analysis
showed that MCA tree geometry predicted pial COLN
and COL-D, albeit with less strength than retina (R2 =
0.61–0.78 and 0.60–0.86, p\0.0001, respectively) (Online
Figure 10). The most predictive MCA patterning metrics
closely predicted (p \ 0.0001) COL-N (±3.3 collaterals,
K-fold R2 = 0.78) and COL-D (±1.6 mm, R2 = 0.86) and
show that features of the MCA tree such as larger
branching density, larger calibers of branches, and smaller
cerebral hemisphere area predict larger COL-N and/or
COL-D (Online Figure 11).
Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis
that genetic polymorphisms responsible for variation in
collateral extent [14] also cause strain-specific differences
in branch patterning of the retinal artery tree that correlate
with and predict differences in collateral extent. No studies
are extant in the literature that provide even an entre ´e to

answering this question, i.e., none has examined whether
retinal vascular geometry varies with genetic background
in mice or other laboratory species, wherein potential
confounding effects of differences in environmental factors
can be held constant. Our findings support this hypothesis.
Retinal artery geometry varied with differences in genetic
background and strongly predicted actual pial collateral
number and diameter. Values for correlation and predictive
strength derived from analysis of individual mice versus
across strains were (a R2 of 1.00 equals a perfect correlation
/prediction): R2 of 0.83 versus 0.98 for number and
0.73 versus 0.88 for diameter, with predictive strength of
±3.4 versus 1.2 for number and ±1.9 versus 1.2 lm for
diameter, p\ 0.0001 for all (Figs. 6E, F, 8A, B). Moreover
, these predicted values for collateral number and
diameter strongly predicted actual infarct volume after
MCA occlusion: R2 = 0.85 and 0.87, ±5.1 mm3 for infarct
volume, p\ 0.0001 (Fig. 8C). This is in agreement with
the major role of differences in collateral blood flow in
determining differences in stroke severity [1, 3, 5–9, 14,
19, 20]. These results suggest that variation in arterial
arborization in the retina may predict variation in collateral
extent in humans and severity of ischemic injury if arterial
obstruction occurs.
The two strongest metrics for predicting genetic differences
in collateral number and diameter were D2 (diameter
of the larger daughter vessel at bifurcations along the
largest artery within the tree, positively correlated) and
average length of branch segments (negatively correlated)
(Fig. 6). The latter, which was also true in the MCA tree
study, is consistent with a larger number of branches in a
tree providing a greater number of opportunities for collaterals
to form between adjacent trees—a process termed
collaterogenesis that occurs during development [16, 17,
34]. The positive relationship with D2 may reflect artery
trees that form, enlarge their diameters, and extend outward
faster during gestation to reach the crowns of adjacent
trees, thus facilitating collaterogenesis [16, 17]. Other
patterning metrics associated with greater collateral extent
and thus lesser stroke severity were larger retinal areas,
wider branch angles, more equitable distribution of blood
flow (lower optimality), and greater vessel complexity
(higher lacunarity, shorter branch segments, and greater
variation in branch segment lengths). All of these metrics
describe a larger, more complex tree with a greater number
of distal-most arterioles that would thus provide more
opportunities to form collaterals during collaterogenesis.
Thus, one simple hypothesis to explain our results is that
genetic background determines the timing of arterial tree
formation, outgrowth, and branch patterning during
development; this in turn determines the number and
proximity of distal branches in adjacent artery trees across
which collaterals can then form (i.e., collaterogenesis,
which occurs in the embryo after arterial tree formation
[16, 17]); thus patterning predicts collateral extent in the
adult. Arguing against this ‘‘opportunity hypothesis’’ is that
genetic-dependent differences in collateral diameter, which
correlate closely with those for number [3, 14, 61], would
not seem to need to follow this scenario. Also, genetic
differences in arterial tree patterning in the adult may
primarily reflect subtle sculpting-like changes that occur
during the first few weeks postnatal [16, 17]. Moreover, our
previous findings have found that collaterogenesis is a
unique process very different from arterial tree formation
and that the process itself, as well as the large difference in
its vigor in the B6 and BALB/c strains, i.e., the number and
diameter of collaterals that form, does not appear to depend
on whether distal branches of adjacent arterial trees are in
proximity [16]. An alternative hypothesis that thus arises is
that one or more genes, which exist as naturally occurring
variants, are shared by independent signaling pathways that
control artery tree patterning and collaterogenesis (‘‘shared
gene hypothesis’’). Additional studies will be required to
distinguish between these hypotheses.
As suggested by previous qualitative observations [3, 4,
16, 18], MCA tree structure also varied with genetic
background. Greater collateral extent was associated most
strongly with the same features associated in retina, i.e.,
larger vessel calibers, wider branch angles at branch points,
and smaller tree area. However, while multivariate
regression analysis of the strongest predictive metrics
identified in retina showed that MCA tree geometry also
predicts pial collateral extent, statistical strength was
approximately half than that of retina. Also, some of the
metrics derived from both the retina and MCA trees did not
correlate on bivariate analysis. Several factors could contribute
to these differences. Analysis of the MCA tree was
done in a smaller number of strains (4) and mice per strain
(5–6) due to exigencies of resource allocation. The
inability to image the MCA tree in a flattened orientation
likely introduced a small amount of error. Differences in
time of development of the brain and retina and their
vascular trees may contribute (discussed below). In addition
, retina lacks collaterals, while the presence of collateral
connections between the MCA and adjacent trees
during postnatal growth and maturation of the brain may
contribute to normal activity-dependent changes in regional
tissue blood flow. This could cause a difference in flowdependent
adaptive outward remodeling of the MCA tree
as reflected in the larger arterial diameters (i.e., D0 and
D2), in strains with low collateral number and diameter. In
other words, such ‘‘environmental’’ hemodynamic factors
could change the value of a given metric, such that the
metric will predict collateral extent because its value is
affected, itself, by collateral extent. Irrespective of whether
this speculation is true, our findings show that inherent

genetic patterning differences in the retinal artery tree are
stronger predictors, compared to the MCA tree, of genetic
differences in collateral extent.
An intriguing question is why differences in branch
patterning in retinal artery trees so strongly predicts differences
in collateral extent in the brain, when one tissue
has collaterals (brain) while the other does not (retina).
Before addressing this question, it should be noted that
while most tissues have collaterals, several lack them,
presumably because either they are supplied by a single
artery and thus possess a single artery tree (e.g., retina,
kidney) or their blood flow significantly exceeds the oxygen
demand of their parenchymal cells, thus eliminating
the need for native collaterals to, as conjectured [41],
optimize delivery of oxygen (discussed below) (e.g., lung,
kidney). Our finding that genetic-dependent differences in
the patterning metrics in retina are shared in part in the
arterial trees of another tissue, the MCA tree of the brain—
and thus also closely correlate with collateral extent—
allows us to propose a possible answer to this question.
Formation of the retinal and neocortical vasculatures share
many anatomic similarities during development and maturation
[25]. In mouse, the MCA, ACA, and posterior
cerebral artery trees form from embryonic day (E)*E9.5
to E16.5 (birth occurs at *E19.5–E21), while pial collaterals
form from *E15.5 to E18.5 [16, 17], and retinal
arterial trees form from *P5 to P12 [35, 36]. In humans,
there is a similar time-specific sequence, i.e., the MCA tree
is established by 9 weeks of gestation, pial collaterals by
14 weeks [37, 38], and the retinal arterial trees begin formation
at *18 weeks [39, 40]. Accordingly, genetic variation
in patterning of the MCA, collaterogenesis, and
retinal trees is likely to be impacted similarly, and thus
correlated, by developmental stage-specific differences in
expression of vascular developmental genes possessing
functional polymorphisms, e.g., mouse Dce1 and the genes
that it potentially drives that control collaterogenesis [14,
16–20]. Of note, naturally occurring gene variants in some
of these genes can be anticipated to have subtle effects on
arterial branch patterning in tissues, as shown herein, but
large effects on the extent of the collateral circulation. This
dichotomy is presumably due, on the one hand, to the
evolution of redundant mechanisms that compensate for
polymorphisms within genes in the pathway that drives
development of the general arterial-venous circulation, as
exemplified by the retinal and MCA trees, because a
functional circulation is required early-on for embryogenesis
to proceed. While on the other hand, in the case of the
pathway that drives collaterogenesis (which presumably
has some genes that overlap with the angiogenic pathway),
little if any requirement and thus genetic selection pressure
exists to have caused evolution of compensatory signaling
mechanisms to assure that an abundant collateral
circulation forms [41]. This is because possession of a poor
collateral circulation does not have an effect on reproductive
fitness, at least in healthy mice maintained in a
vivarium [3, 12].
Notwithstanding the above speculations, genetic differences
in collateral extent in brain are mirrored in other
tissues of the same mouse (e.g., skeletal muscle and
intestine) [4, 14, 18–21, 23]. Thus, branch patterning of the
retinal arterial tree will likely also correlate with collateral
extent in non-brain tissues. Whether genetic-dependent
differences in arterial tree patterning in other tissues exist
and link the same metrics seen in retina and the MCA tree
to differences in collateral extent will require additional
study. However, in support of this, arterial tree patterning
in skeletal muscle is very different in C57BL/6 and BALB/
cBy mice that have large differences in collateral extent
(and that were studied herein) [22, 23].
Genetic background affects retinal tree structure in
humans. In twin studies, estimates of heritability of CRAE,
an indicator of retinal artery diameters, ranged from 56 to
70 % [42, 43], with lower values (20–21 %) for sib–sib
correlations in family-based studies [44, 45]. Consistent with
this, we found that artery caliber showed the strongest
genetic variation, up to 73 %. In another twin study, heritability
of arteriolar tortuosity was 82 % [46]. Our finding that
D2, D0, CRAE, and tortuosity vary strongly with genetic
background in mice supports these findings, although tortuosity
in retina did not emerge as a predictor of collateral
extent in multivariate analysis but did so in the MCA. Several
genetic loci have been associated with different retinal
topologies. For example, a genome-wide SNP association
study of more than 15,000 unrelated individuals identified
five loci associated with a fraction, albeit small (1–3 %), of
the variation in retinal venular diameter [47]. One locus was
associated with coronary artery disease and hypertension.
Whether the other loci associate with additional ‘‘environmental
’’ risk factors known to induce changes in venular
diameter or other retinopathy signs, or instead link to
intrinsic differences in retinal venular diameter, cannot be
determined by such studies.
The present findings demonstrate that retinal patterning
predicts stroke outcome in mice. We are unaware of previous
studies in animals or humans that have examined
whether severity of infarct volume in acute stroke or heart
attack (i.e., outcome rather than risk of occurrence) or
tissue injury in chronic heart disease or PAD, which are all
strongly impacted by known or presumed differences in
native collateral extent [1–4, 9–11], is associated with
intrinsic differences in retinal patterning that are independent
of retinopathy changes. The latter are known to occur
with hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk
factors and have also been linked to increased risk of small/
large artery stroke, white matter disease, myocardial

infarction, ischemic heart disease, PAD, and incidence of
mortality [24–28, 48–50]. Doubal et al. [33] reported that
fractal dimension of the entire retinal circulation inversely
correlated with age and incidence of lacunar stroke, after
correcting for hypertension, diabetes, stroke severity, and
white matter hyperintensity. The authors suggested that a
distinct vasculopathy that correlates with reduced retinal
branching complexity (and/or vessel density) causes lacunar
stroke. This was followed by speculation in an
accompanying editorial that ‘‘loss of branching complexity
of small vessels in the brain leads to the loss of collateral
circulation…, which in turn increases the risk of lacunar
infarcts’’ [51]. Our finding that low retinal complexity
correlates with/predicts low collateral extent supports this
speculation. However, in our study, a difference in genetic
background underlies (‘‘leads to’’) this association. Interestingly
, in regards to the above editorial comment, we
have found that ‘‘environmental factors,’’ e.g., aging [52],
endothelial dysfunction [21], and the presence of other
cardiovascular risk factors [23], cause loss of pial and
skeletal muscle collaterals, reduced diameter of those that
are still present, and increased infarct volume and hindlimb
ischemia in mouse models of stroke and PAD. These
findings have recently found support in patients with
ischemic stroke [53].
Our study has several limitations. The correlations
identified are dependent on the strains chosen. Mice were
not randomly selected from a wild or wild-derived outbred
population of mice, thus limiting the generalizability of our
results to the 10 strains studied. This was because the only
practical way to test the hypothesis was in a cohort of
inbred strains with known wide differences in collateral
extent and infarct volume, and where multiple individuals
with the same genetic background could be phenotyped to
minimize measurement error and stochastic variation. In
particular, the close relationship among the four strains on
CD1 background may have led to an underestimate of the
genetic contribution to each of the traits. A second limitation
is that a better test of external validity would have
been to take the most predictive metrics from the current
study and test their performance on a new, independently
obtained set of retinas belonging to the same strains.
Because of fiscal exigencies, we instead used leave-one-out
K-fold cross-validation to reduce statistical bias and simulate
such an external validation experiment [32]. An even
stronger validation for future studies would be to test the
most predictive metrics on a subset of the Collaborative
Cross, a genetic mapping population that captures more
than 90 % of the allelic variation in the mouse species [54].
An additional limitation is that we only studied healthy
*3-month-old young adult mice (although note that they
have comparable body weight and arterial pressure [3, 18–
20, 55]). However, in many patients where a collateral RPI
would be of use, obesity, hypertension, and other cardiovascular
risk factors and disease (environmental factors)
will often be present to potentially confound genetic
determinants of retinal patterning and collateral extent.
Aging, smoking, hypertension, basal metabolic rate, and
peripheral vascular disease have been associated with and
presumed to cause changes in retinal artery patterning
metrics [24–28, 48–50]. For example, aging and hypertension
associate with narrowing of bifurcation angles and
microvascular rarefaction [56]. Indeed, severity of these
and other overt retinopathies have been used to predict
extant end-organ damage and to monitor response to
therapy in hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
stroke [28]. Recent studies have shown that this geneticenvironment
interaction also extends to the collateral circulation.
In mice, aging, hypertension, metabolic syndrome
, and endothelial dysfunction cause loss of collateral
number and diameter in brain and skeletal muscle (collateral
rarefaction) that is not seen in similarly sized arterioles
in the adjacent arterial trees [21, 23, 52]. Supporting evidence
has recently been reported in humans based on
measures of collateral status in brain and heart [53, 57].
Thus, it will be important to investigate and adjust for such
interactions in future animal and human studies aimed at
extending the present findings. This should be possible
since genetic background, at least in mice, has a stronger
effect on collateral extent than environmental factors [3, 4,
12, 14, 16, 18–23, 52].
The translation of a retinal predictor index for use in
patients with acute stroke will require rapid imaging and
analysis. Fortunately, five out of seven and seven out of nine
of the most informative predictive metrics for collateral
number and diameter, respectively, were inner-zone metrics
that do not require segmentation of the entire retinal artery
trees. Moreover, these metrics have been obtained in many
studies and large-population registries [24–28]. However,
whether these same metrics will be informative in humans
requires confirmation. Recent development of fully automated
software for quantification of the architecture of the
retinal circulation and other two-dimensional vascular trees
[58, 59] will greatly reduce the time required for the manual
steps of image analysis used in the present study. Measurement
of collateral status in brain requires neuroimaging [1, 9]
and in heart and peripheral limb requires arterial catheterization
[10, 11].These requirements will present challenges in
future studies seeking to extend the current approach to
healthy humans. However, approximately 10 % of patients
presenting with angina have no detectable CAD or other
cardiovascular disease on subsequent evaluation [10].
Moreover, collateral status in the extremities of these
‘‘healthy’’ individuals, as well as those with CAD, can be
readily obtained at the time of coronary evaluation [11].
Finally, if identification of the gene(s) responsible for
Angiogenesis (2015) 18:97–114 111

variation in collateral extent in mice [14] can be confirmed in
humans [15], this may permit combination of a rapid genetic
test with a collateral retinal predictor index in prospective
studies as well as in the analysis of retinal registries that
integrate stroke, CAD or PAD with twin, family- and population-based
genetic data. Such studies could be aided if
what has been found in mice [3, 4, 14, 16, 18–21, 23, 52] is 
confirmed in human, i.e., that collateral extent in one tissue is
shared by other tissues of the same individual.
In conclusion, our findings in mice show that retinal
arterial tree patterning varies with genetic background and
predicts genetic-dependent differences in pial collateral
number, diameter, and infarct volume with high accuracy
(80–90 %). Our findings comparing retina and MCA trees
suggest that the retina may be unique in the strength of its
arterial geometry to predict variation in collaterals in brain
and other tissues. If a similar retinal predictor index can be
validated in humans, it may lead to development of a
noninvasive, relatively inexpensive biomarker to aid
existing neuroimaging and hemodynamic methods, as well
as possible future genetic tests, in predicting variation in
collateral extent. Such a multimodal screening would
provide a means to predict the likelihood of severe tissue
injury before obstructive disease develops. This knowledge
could aid adoption of lifestyles and treatments aimed at
avoiding or reducing risk factors for obstructive disease.
When obstruction does occur, combining a retinal predictor
index with collateral scoring would improve the knowledge
needed to guide treatment choice and tailor the time window
for recanalization therapy. With progression of time
after onset of stroke, patients with poor collateral status are
less likely to benefit from revascularization and more likely
to develop intracranial hemorrhage after treatment [1, 5–9].
Thus, such tailoring seeks to identify patients with poor
collaterals for exclusion of treatment, while providing an
extended window to those with good collateral circulation
[1, 9]. In addition, stratifying patients according to collateral
extent would likely reduce the variability seen in past
clinical studies. For example, recent findings suggest that
variability in predicting functional outcome, based on NIHSS
at baseline and early after stroke, can be significantly
reduced by stratifying patients for collateral status [60].
Furthermore, in studies examining new treatments aimed at
increasing collateral flow, variability in efficacy may be
reduced by stratifying patients for poor versus good collateral
extent.
