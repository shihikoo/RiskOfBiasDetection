Abstract
Background.: Native (pre-existing) collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses that interconnect adjacent arterial trees
and serve as endogenous bypass vessels that limit tissue injury in ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary and
peripheral artery disease. Their extent (number and diameter) varies widely among mouse strains and healthy humans. We
previously identified a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7 (Canq1, LOD = 29) responsible for 37% of the
heritable variation in collateral extent between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. We sought to identify candidate genes in Canq1
responsible for collateral variation in the cerebral pial circulation, a tissue whose strain-dependent variation is shared by
similar variation in other tissues.
Methods and Findings: Collateral extent was intermediate in a recombinant inbred line that splits Canq1 between the
C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains. Phenotyping and SNP-mapping of an expanded panel of twenty-one informative inbred strains
narrowed the Canq1 locus, and genome-wide linkage analysis of a SWRxSJL-F2 cross confirmed its haplotype structure.
Collateral extent, infarct volume after cerebral artery occlusion, bleeding time, and re-bleeding time did not differ in
knockout mice for two vascular-related genes located in Canq1, IL4ra and Itgal. Transcript abundance of 6 out of 116 genes
within the 95% confidence interval of Canq1 were differentially expressed.2-fold (p-value,0.054150) in the cortical pia
mater from C57BL/6 and BALB/c embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 time-points that span the period of collateral formation.
Conclusions: These findings refine the Canq1 locus and identify several genes as high-priority candidates important in
specifying native collateral formation and its wide variation.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and atherosclerotic
disease of arteries supplying the brain, heart and lower extremities
are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Recently, variation
in the density and diameter (extent) of the native pre-existing
collaterals present in a tissue have become recognized as important
determinants of the wide variation in severity of tissue injury
caused by these diseases [1–4]. Collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole
anastomoses that are present in most tissues and cross-connect a
small fraction of distal-most arterioles of adjacent arterial trees.
After acute obstruction of an arterial trunk, collateral extent
dictates the amount of retrograde perfusion from adjacent trees
thus severity of ischemic injury. With chronic obstruction, native
collaterals undergo anatomic lumen enlargement, a process
termed collateral remodeling or arteriogenesis that requires daysto-weeks
to reach completion, resulting in an increase in
conductance of the collateral network [5].
Surprisingly, native collateral extent differs widely among
‘‘healthy’’ individuals, ie, those free of stenosis of arteries supplying
the heart or brain. Thus coronary collateral flow (ie, CFI
p
) varies
more than 10-fold in individuals without coronary artery disease
[4,6]. Likewise, large differences in collateral-dependent cerebral
blood flow are evident in individuals after sudden embolic stroke
[2,3,7]. Moreover, direct measurement of native collateral extent
shows that it varies widely among healthy inbred mouse strains [8–
10]. Variation in healthy humans and mice can be attributed to
genetic differences affecting mechanisms that control formation of
the collateral circulation, which in mouse occurs late in gestation
[11,12], and to differences in environmental influences and
cardiovascular risk factors that recent studies are finding affect
persistence of these vessels in adults [13,14].
We previously identified a prominent QTL on chromosome 7
(Canq1, LOD = 29) responsible for 37% of the heritable variation
in collateral extent (as well as collateral remodeling) in the cerebral
circulation of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice [15]—strains which
exhibit the widest difference among 15 strains examined [9].
Moreover, these same 15 strains had an equally wide variation in
infarct volume after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion that
was tightly and inversely correlated with collateral density and
diameter, thus establishing a strong causal relationship between
severity of stroke and collateral extent [9,16]. Three other loci

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
were responsible for an additional 35% of the variation in
collateral extent [15]. Importantly, genetic-dependent differences
in collateral extent in the cerebral circulation are shared by similar
variation in other tissues, at least in mice [8,10,17,18]. Consistent
with this, Canq1 maps to the same location on chromosome 7 as
recently reported QTL linked to hindlimb ischemia (LSq1) [19]
and cerebral infarct volume (Civq1) [16]. Thus, our findings [15]
identify the physiological substrate, variation in collateral extent
that underlies these QTL.
Efficient Mixed-model Association Mapping with high-density
SNPs for the above 15 strains allowed us to narrow Canq1 to a
region (‘‘EMMA region’’) [15]. In the present study we sought to
further refine this locus and the candidate genes potentially
responsible for collateral variation. Identification of the causal
genetic element(s) will reveal key signaling pathways controlling
collateral formation—about which little is known [1,12,17].
Moreover, if subsequently confirmed in humans, this information
will aid patient stratification, clinical decision making, and the
development of collaterogenic therapies. To this end, we
strengthened our association mapping over Canq1 using additional
inbred strains, performed linkage analysis of a second genetic
mapping population, measured collateral extent and infarct
volume in mice genetically deficient for several candidate genes,
and examined expression of 116 genes spanning the EMMA
region and Canq1 in the pial circulation of mouse embryos during
the period when the collateral circulation forms.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Mouse strains (male, ,10 weeks-old): LP/J, NON/ShiLtJ
(NON), LEWES/EiJ, 129X1/SvJ (129X1), CAST/EiJ, C57BL/6J
(B6), BALB/cByJ (Bc), Itgal2/2 (#005257, B6 background), Il42/2
(#002518, B6 background), Il4ra2/2 (#003514, Bc background)
and CXB11.HiAJ (CxB11) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories.
PWD were a gift of Dr. Fernando Pardo-Manuel, UNC. F1
progeny obtained from reciprocal mating of SWR/J (SWR) and
SJL/J (SJL) were mated to produce a 10-week old F2 reciprocal
population. This study was approved by the University of North
Carolina’s Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee and was
performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
guidelines.
Phenotyping
Mice were phenotyped for collateral number, diameter and
cerebral artery tree territories as described previously [15]
(Materials and Methods S1).
Association Mapping
As detailed previously [15], the EMMA algorithm [20,21] was
applied in the R statistical package to collateral number, obtained
from 21 inbred strains comprised of 15 previously reported strains [9]
plus 6 newly phenotyped strains. Known and imputed dense SNP
data were downloaded from http://phenome.jax.org/db/q?rtn =
snps/download and http://compgen.unc.edu/wp/ and pooled. The
kinship matrix (pair-wise relatedness) among the 21 inbred strains
was calculated using the dense SNP-set within the Canq1 region, and
modeled as random effects [22]. Each SNP within Canq1 was
modeled as a fixed effect. After the mixed model was fitted, an F-test
was conducted and a p-value obtained at each SNP location.
DNA Isolation, Genotyping and Linkage Analysis
Tail genomic DNA from SWRxSJL-F2 mice (n = 123) was
genotyped using the 377-SNP GoldenGate genotyping array
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). SNP positions were obtained from
Build 37.1 of the NCBI SNP database. There are 324 informative
markers on 19 autosomes in this array, including 29 on Chr 7 with
6 between 121.5 and 144.5 thus 1 every ,4 Mb. Collateral
number was subjected to linkage analysis using the single QTL
model in the R statistical package [15]. Threshold for significant
QTL was defined as p = 0.05.
Bleeding and Re-bleeding Assays
Bleeding (thrombosis) and re-bleeding (thrombolysis) assays
were similar to previous methods [23]. Under 1.2% isoflurane
anesthesia supplemented with oxygen and with rectal temperature
maintained at 37uC, the tail was pre-warmed for 5 min in 50 mL
of 37uC saline. A 5 mm length from the tip of the tail was
amputated with a fresh sterile#11 scalpel blade, and the tail was
immediately returned to the saline. The cut surface was positioned
10 mm below the ventral surface of the body. Bleeding time was
the time between the beginning and cessation of bleeding. Rebleeding
time was the time between cessation and resumption of
bleeding.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Measurement of
Infarct Volume
These were done as detailed previously [15] (Materials and
Methods S1).
Gene Expression
B6 and Bc breeders were paired at 10–12 weeks-age. The
presence of a vaginal plug the morning after pairing was
designated as 0.5 days post-coitus (E0.5). Embryos were collected
at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 under deep anesthesia (ketamine+xylazine
, 100+15 mg/kg) and staged according to crown-to-rump
length. Brains were quickly removed into RNAlaterH (Sigma-
Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO) and stored at 220uC. Approximately
24 hours later the pia mater containing the pial circulation
was peeled from the dorsal cerebral cortex of both hemispheres
under a stereomicroscope and stored in RNAlaterH at220uC. Pia
from 8–10 embryos of each strain were pooled for each RNA
sample ($2 litters per pool). Three pooled RNA samples were
prepared for each strain and time-point (18 samples; ,100
embryos/strain). Samples were thawed in RNAlater and homogenized
(TH, Omni International, Marietta, GA) in Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was purified using the
RNeasy Micro Kit according to the manufacturer (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). RNA concentration and quality were determined
by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Foster City, CA), respectively.
Measurement of transcript number was conducted for 139 selected
genes and 11 splice variants by the genomics facility at UNC using
NanoString custom-synthesized probes (NanoString, Seattle, WA)
[24,25]. Transcript number for each gene was normalized to the
mean of 6 housekeeping genes: Gapdh, bactin, Tubb5, Hprt1, Ppia
and Tbp.
For quantitative RT-PCR, reverse transcription was performed
with SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen,#
11904-018) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification
was achieved with SYBRH Green JumpStartTM Taq Ready-
MixTM (Sigma, #S4438) on a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life
Science). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and values averaged.
Primer sequences are listed in Table S1. Data were analyzed
using the Relative Expression Software Tool 2009 (version 2.0.13)
and calculations as described [26].

Statistical Analysis
Values are mean6SEM. Significance was p,0.05 unless stated
otherwise. ANOVA and Student’s t-tests were used as indicated in
the figures and tables. For analysis of expression: (1) transcript
numbers for strain and embryonic time-point were subjected to 2-
way ANOVA, with Bonferroni adjustment of p-values for multiple
comparisons (p-values4150, for 150 transcripts). (2) ANOVA pvalues
were also derived after correction with the Bonferroni
inequality for pre-planned post-hoc tests for 2 strains and 3 time
points. (3) Student’s t-tests were used to test effect of strain
independent of time, with and without Bonferroni adjustment (pvalues4150). Statistical treatment of association mapping data was
as described [15].
Results
Collateral Number in CXB11.HiAJ RIL Verifies Canq1 on
Chromosome 7
The CxB recombinant inbred lines (RILs) originated from Bc
and B6 parentals [27]. Among them, CxB11.HiAJ (CxB11) is
particularly relevant. Given the unique mosaic genetic structure
for each RIL, we hypothesized that if Canq1 in general, and the
‘‘EMMA region’’ [15] in particular, are determinants of collateral
extent, an RIL that inherits this locus from either B6 (abundant
large-diameter collaterals) or Bc (sparse small-diameter collaterals)
[8–10,15] will exhibit traits dominated by the parental phenotype.
CxB11 splits Canq1 such that the centromeric half of Canq1 and the
EMMA region are from B6 (Figure 1A). These results confirm
our previous findings [15] showing the importance of Canq1 and
the EMMA region for specifying collateral extent.
Because area (‘‘size’’) of the MCA, ACA, and PCA trees varies
with genetic background and could contribute to variation in
collateral extent [9], we measured the percentage of cortical
territory supplied by each tree. Values for CxB11 (Figure 1C) fall
within the range of differences that have no correlation with
variation in collateral extent; also, the parental strains are identical
as reported previously [9]. Thus, variation in tree size cannot
explain the CxB11 results.
Additional Inbred Strains Strengthen and Refine the
EMMA Region
EMMA mapping is more efficient computationally and
accounts better for population structure embedded in inbred
strains, when compared to traditional association mapping
algorithms [21]. We previously applied this algorithm to 15
inbred strains and obtained a most-significant 172 kb region
(EMMA-A, p = 2.26 1025) and a second-most significant region
(EMMA-B, 290 kb, p = 4.26 1024) [15]. To strengthen this
analysis, we first generated a heatmap of the known and imputed
SNPs within EMMA-A for 74 inbred strains (Figure S1). The 15
strains lowest on the y-axis are those used previously [15]. The
lowest 5 have significantly fewer collaterals than B6. Among the 15
strains, 9 out of 10 with high collateral number exhibit a DNA
haplotype-like block similar to B6 (Figure 2, blue), whereas all 5
strains with low collateral number exhibit a haplotype-like block
similar to Bc (Figure 2, mostly green). The exception is SJL/J
Figure 1. Collateral extent in CXB11.HiAJ (CxB11) confirms importance of Canq1.A , Inheritance patterns of Cang1 on chromosome 7 in

Bc, black) that includes the EMMA region and extends through Itgal. B, Collateral number is intermediate between B6 and Bc in CxB11 and
significantly different from B6xBc-F1.C, Territory of cerebral cortex supplied by the ACA, MCA, and PCA trees. B6 and Bc are identical (confirms Zhang
et al. [9]), while CxB11 has smaller MCA and PCA and larger ACA territory than B6. These differences do not correlate with variation in collateral
number or diameter in these or 15 other strains [9]. Numbers of mice given in parentheses in this and other figures.

(discussed below). To test the robustness of the EMMA-A region
for variation in collateral number, we chose the 6 most informative
additional inbred strains from the 74 lines (denoted red in
Figure 2): 3 strains with haplotype structures predicting high
(129X1, LP, NON) and low (CAST/Ei, PWD, LEWES/Ei)
collateral number. Collateral numbers in 4 of these strains fit the
prediction from their haplotype structures (Figure S2). The
remaining two are wild-derived strains that have more complex
ancestry and haplotype structures.
An important consideration is whether the EMMA-A peak shifts
position or if the significant SNPs change their p-values from our
previous findings [15] after the additional 6 strains are remapped
with the original 15. Figure 3 shows that EMMA-A did not
change position, that the previous EMMA-A peak was narrowed
further, and that the new peak acquired increased significance for
the same SNPs (p = 96 1026).
The kinship matrix used to account for population structure will
vary with use of different SNPs as new strains are considered [22].
Furthermore, we previously did not allow missing genotypes to
avoid a decrease in statistical power [15]. We thus examined the
effect of several parameters on our new mapping results by:
allowing fewer than 3 missing genotypes in the strains; using only
informative SNPs; excluding wild-derived strains. Irrespective of
these mapping parameters, 4 SNPs always had the most significant
p-values (rs32978185, rs32978627, rs32973294, and rs32973297;
132.502–132.504 Mb; Figures S3, S4, S5, S6, S7).
Genome-wide QTL Mapping of SWRxSJL-F2 Shows
Absence of Canq1
Strains SJL and SWR have identical Bc-like haplotype
structures in the EMMA regions, but SJL averages 9.6A ´60.4
collaterals per hemisphere while SWR averages 1.360.4
(Figure 4). To test the validity of the EMMA regions and
possibly identify additional QTL, we created a SWRxSJL-F2 cross
and performed genome-wide LOD score profiling of collateral
number-by-genotype. As predicted, we found no QTL on Chr 7

(Figure 4). We also found no QTL elsewhere in the genome. We
did not measure collateral diameter because 1) of the time
required to obtain average collateral diameter for each of the 123
F2 mice, 2) we have shown that variation in collateral number and
diameter map to the same Canq1 locus [15], 3) collateral diameter
has a much smaller range of variation than number, thus lower
LOD score [15], and 4) no significant QTL was found for
collateral number (Figure 4).
Collateral Extent, Hemostasis and Infarct Volume in
Il4ra2/2, Il42/2 and Itgal2/2 Do Not Support these Genes
as Candidates for Canq1
Collateral extent in the adult is determined by mechanisms that
specify their formation in the embryo. Recent studies indicate that
Vegfa, Clic4, Flk1, Adam10 and Adam17 are important in this process
[11,12,17,18]. However, none of these genes nor others known to
impact their expression or signaling pathways are located in
EMMA-B, with the exception of IL4ra (interleukin 4 receptor
alpha chain). Expression of Il4ra is lower in Bc compared to B6
(see below). Moreover, IL4ra is present on endothelial cells (and
other cell types) where it dimerizes with IL13ra or cc to mediate
responses to IL4 and IL13. These include increased expression of
VEGF-A; furthermore, hypoxia-induced VEGF-A expression and
angiogenesis are reduced in Il42/2 mice [28–30]. We thus
examined Il42/2 (B6 background) and Il4ra2/2 (only available on
Bc background) mice. Collateral extent in Il42/2 mice (9.5
collaterals, 21 um diameter) was not different from B6 (9.3 and
23 um) (Figure 5). Likewise, collateral extent in Il4ra2/2 mice
(0.2 collaterals, 17 um) was similar to Bc (0.2 and 13 um). These
results do not support involvement of IL4ra in variation of
collateral extent. Knockout mice are not available for the other
genes (see below) in EMMA-B.
Given the limitations of any mapping algorithm, it is possible
that a genetic element(s) outside of EMMA-B could underlie
Canq1. Several findings identify Itgal (integrin a-L chain, CD11a)
as a candidate. Itgal is located at 134 Mb near the peak of Canq1.
Itgal dimerizes with integrin b2-chain (CD18) to form LFA-1
which is present on platelets and most leukocyte types and binds
ICAM1 on endothelial cells, leading to firm adhesion and
transmigration [31,32]. Keum and Marchuk identified Itgal as a
candidate gene within the Civq1 QTL for infarct volume measured
24 hours after permanent MCA occlusion in a B6xBc-F2
population [16], and Itgal2/2 mice have smaller infarct volumes
24 hours after 1-hour transient MCA occlusion model [32].
However, Itgal2/2 mice had the same collateral extent as B6
controls (Figure 5). Consistent with this, infarct volume 24 hours
after permanent MCA occlusion was not different in Itgal2/2 mice
(Figure 5). Infarct volume was also not affected in Il42/2 mice (B6
background; Figure 5), in agreement with no effect on collateral
extent. These findings do not support Itgal or Il4ra as candidate
genes for Canq1 [15] or Civq1 [16].
Variation in MCA tree size among strains is also a determinant
of variation in infarct volume after permanent [9] or transient [33]
MCA occlusion. MCA tree size was smaller in Itgal2/2 mice
(Figure 5), which may contribute to their smaller infarct volume
after transient MCA occlusion [32].
The involvement of other factors besides collateral extent in
determining severity of brain ischemia after acute occlusion could
underlie previous [31] findings. Leukocyte/platelet adhesion and
hemostasis have complex influences on infarct volume, especially
after transient occlusion, through effects on thrombosis and
thrombolysis (ie, hemostasis) and inflammation [33,34]. Moreover,
thrombosis and thrombolysis vary with genetic background [23].
Because these mechanisms could be affected inItgal2/2 andIL42/2
mice, we measured bleeding and re-bleeding time to assay
Figure 5. Collateral extent is not altered in Itgal, IL4 or IL4ra deficient mice relative to host strains. A, Itgal2/2 and Il42/2 mice are B6
while Il4ra2/2 (receptor alpha) are Bc background. Number and diameter are not significantly different among Itgal2/2, Il4 2/2 and B6, nor between
Il4ra2/2 and Bc (t-tests). B, Territory (size) of ACA, MCA, and PCA trees are same in B6 and Bc but differ in Itgal2/2 and Il4ra2/2, confirming
dissociation of collateral and tree territory phenotypes among inbred mouse strains [9]. C,D, Bleeding and infarct volume of knockouts are not
different from B6; re-bleeding in Il42/2 is not different from B6 but shorter in Itgal2/2 (t-tests).

thrombosis and thrombolysis, respectively. No differences were
observed among knockouts and B6 controls (Figure 5), with the
exception of shorter time to re-bleeding in Itgal2/2 mice (discussed
below). Depending on models and severity of stroke, increased
thrombolysis can either reduce no-reflow and lessen infarct volume,
or increase petechial hemorrhage and no-reflow and increase infarct
volume [33,34]. IL4ra2/2 mice were not analyzed for bleeding and
re-bleeding because of their cost, because IL42/2 showed no

differences in these assays, and because the data in Panels A and B
of Figure 5, where both IL42/2 and IL4ra2/2 mice were studied,
provided no support for these genes in the difference in collateral
extent in mice.
We also studied hindlimb ischemia [10] in Il42/2, Itgal2/2 and
their B6 background strain (Figure S8) and obtained results in
agreement with the above cerebral studies for lack of effect on
native collateral extent in a second tissue—skeletal muscle.
Although not the subject of this study, recovery of blood flow
was less in Il42/2 mice, suggesting reduced collateral remodeling
(see Figure S8 for relevant references). Blood differential cell count
(Table S2) identified that Itgal2/2 (but not IL42/2) mice have
reduced platelets compared to their B6 background strain, which
may contribute to their shorter re-bleeding time (Figure 5); they
also have increased total leukocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes, which has been reported previously (see Table S2
for corroborating references).
Expression of Genes within Canq1
A plausible explanation for the strong effect of the Canq1 locus is
that a gene(s) with strong influence on collateral extent is
differentially expressed between B6 and Bc. To begin to identify
possible candidates, we measured transcript levels of genes within
Canq1 containing SNPs in their coding and 2 Kb flanking regions
from the pial circulation of B6 and Bc embryos at E14.5, E16.5
and E18.5. Collaterals begin to form as a plexus between the
crowns of the cerebral artery trees at E14.5 and reach peak density
by E18.5 [11,12]. Bc embryos form,90% fewer collaterals than
B6, resulting in a similar large difference in collateral number and
diameter in the adult [12]. We thus reasoned that expression
would need to be examined at the time collaterals form. Four
groups of genes were examined: all genes and splice variants
annotated within EMMA-A/B (group I, 10 genes and 5 splice
variants;Table S3); genes with SNP variation between B6 and Bc
strains in coding or regulatory regions (ie, 2 kb 59 and 39 to coding)
within the 95% CI of Canq1 (group II, 106 genes and 6 splice
variants); selected genes located elsewhere in the genome that are
angiogenesis-related (group III, 13 genes) and proliferation-related
(group IV, 10 genes).
Among those examined, 1 gene in EMMA-B (Nsmce1), 6 genes
located within the 95% CI of Canq1 (Pycard, Inpp5f, Tbx6, 3 ‘‘Riken
genes’’) and one located elsewhere (Tert, telomerase) had adjusted
p-values less than 0.05 for a difference between strains at all 3
time-points using the most stringent analysis, ie, 2-way ANOVA
plus Bonferroni adjusted p-value4150 (star-labeled bars in
Figure 6; Table 1; Table S3). All but Inpp5f were more than
2-fold different between B6 and Bc. Nsmce1 has three splicing
isoforms, with two expressing 2.5-to-7-fold higher levels in Bc.
Ino80e was differentially expressed .2-fold at all time-points, but
not significant (although significant with other tests, see below).
Il4ra and Il21r in EMMA-B were only significant by t-test (Tables
S4 and S5).
Expression of 6 genes changed with embryonic time but not
strain (listed last in Table 1). Changes in two of these, Angpt2
(angiopoietin-2) and Tgfb1 (Ltbp1), have well-known roles in
vascular development. Thus, the expected changes serve as a
control for the NanoString assay. In addition, we confirmed results
with qRT-PCR [24,25], using the above RNA samples from Bc
embryos (insufficient RNA prevented qRT-PCR for additional
genes or for B6 embryos). Fold-expression values at E18.5 relative
to E14.5 for Angpt2, Tgfb1 and Klf4 (normalize to b-actin) were
4.060.7, 3.360.9 and 0.760.1 by NanoString; and 3.060.3,
4.060.8 and 1.060.1 by qRT-PCR (p = 0.26, 0.60 and 0.09
between assays). The stem cell factor Klf4 was chosen for
comparison, based on its expected absence of change in the
vasculature at this late time in gestation.
Since our a priori hypothesis was that a difference exists between
the strains in expression of at least one of the 116 selected Canq1
genes, a less stringent level of significance than used in genomewide
cDNA array analysis was warranted, ie, 2-way ANOVA with
p-value corrected using the Bonferroni inequality for pre-planned
comparisons among 2 strains and 3 time-points. Thus for strain
differences, 7 genes had corrected p-values less than 0.001 and 15
less than 0.01 (Figure 6, letters above bars). Seven genes also had
significant differences over time (Table S3, corrected p,0.05).
Table 1 lists 19 of these genes different by strain (‘‘Bonadj strain’’;
only BC017158 and Fus did not have a corrected p,0.01 by this
analysis) and Table S3 lists the remaining 4—Il4ra, Il21r,
AC133494.1 and Tgfb1i1—which had corrected p-values less than
0.01. Since our a priori hypothesis was that a strain difference exists
in expression of one or more of the 116 Canq1 genes, independent
of time, we also conducted t-tests (Tables S4 and S5). Twentythree
genes were significant at p,0.01, and 43 at p,0.05 which is
not unexpected given their location in different haplotype blocks.
Discussion
We recently identified Canq1 as a primary locus responsible for
variation in extent of the collateral circulation in mice [15]. In the
present study we sought to refine this locus and identify candidate
genes responsible for collateral variation. Collateral density was
reduced by approximately 50% in CxB11 RIL mice in which
Canq1 is split between B6 (proximal half) and Bc strains. This
suggests that Canq1 harbors a polymorphism(s) possibly in its
proximal half that governs variation in collateral extent. That a
greater reduction was not obtained may reflect mosaicism
elsewhere in the CxB11 genome (,60% Bc), including at three
other QTL that we found on Chr 1, 3 and 8 with small effects
(Canq-2,-3,-4, LODs of 5–13) [15]. Since multiple regulatory loci
can be linked in cis (as well as trans), it is also possible that a variant
in each half of Canq1 could be involved—a possibility supported by
the cluster of significant SNPs mapped to the far 39 of Canq1
(Figure 3, Figures S3, S4, S5, S6, S7). Generation of congenic
strains that partition Canq1 may allow differentiation between
these possibilities.
We previously used association mapping in 15 classical inbred
strains and narrowed Canq1 to 170 and 290 kb regions (EMMA-A
and-B regions) [15]. To test the robustness of the EMMA-A region
for collateral variation and possibly narrow it further, we
generated a SNP heatmap for 74 inbred strains and identified
the 6 most informative additional inbred strains—3 classical and 3
wild-derived. Association mapping of this 21-strain panel narrowed
EMMA-A and increased its statistical significance. While 4
of the 6 new strains had collateral numbers predicted by their
haplotype structure, Cast/Ei and PWD were outliers (Figure 2).
The unique haplotype structure of these wild-derived strains has
discouraged their use in previous mapping studies [35,36], a
finding which our results confirm. However, the EMMA
haplotype of the wild-derived LEWES strain fit the predicted
collateral number. What might explain this conundrum? Several
studies have utilized dense-SNP data from recent re-sequencing
efforts (NIEHS and Perlegen) to infer ancestral haplotype origins
among the classical inbred strains [35,36]. Using WSB, PWD and
CAST/Ei as reference strains for Mus Musculus subspecies
domesticus, musculus and castaneus, together with the hidden Markov
Model algorithm, Frazer and colleagues [35] found that 11
classical inbred strains shared 68% haplotype origins with
domesticus (WSB), 6% with musculus (PWD), and 3% with castaneus

(CAST/Ei). In another study, Yang et al [36] found that wildderived
strains, which are presumed to represent different
subspecies, have substantial inter-subspecific introgression. Using
the 72% of the autosomal and X-chromosomal 100 kb genomic
intervals, for which the ancestry of the reference strains is
unambiguous, they estimated that the 11 classical inbred strains
inherited 92% of their genomes from Mus domesticus origin, 3–12%
from musculus origin and 1–2% from castaneus origin. In a recent
study, Kirby and co-workers [37] densely genotyped 121,000
SNPs for 94 inbred strains. Inspection of these data shows that
LEWES has close ancestral origins with the WSB strain. Based on
the above studies, we postulate that CAST/Ei and PWD are
outliers in our study because they share minimal ancestral
haplotype origins with the classical inbred strains, while LEWES
shares major ancestry origin with the classical inbred strains and
the predicted collateral number. Importantly, regardless of
whether the wild-derived strains were included or excluded in
our association mapping, the same significant region was obtained
with similar p-values (Figures S3, S4, S5). Moreover, the diverse
genetic background used in our mapping was corrected by
applying the kinship matrix. For example, the average identicalby-descent
between CAST/Ei and the other 20 stains is 0.45 m,
and it is 0.82 between B6 and the other 20 strains. In addition to
the above, a significant additional finding from the 21-strain
analysis is that it suggests that Canq1 is not only important in
controlling collateral formation in the B6 and Bc strains, but also
in 19 additional strains and thus in the mouse species itself.
The SJL strain, which has high collateral density yet possesses
an EMMA haplotype structure apparently identical to SWR, is
also outlier (Figures 2 and 4). Besides the known SNPs that are
identical in EMMA-A,,400 SNPs imputed with high confidence
(.0.9) are identical between SWR and SJL, and the remaining are

also the same among the ,1000 SNPs imputed with lower
confidence. What genetic component(s) regulates the variation in
native collateral extent between SWR and SJL if no variation
exists within EMMA-B? To identify possible additional QTL, plus
confirm our previous [15] and current mapping results, we
performed genome-wide linkage analysis on a SWRxSJL-F2 cross.
No QTL on chromosome 7 was present, a finding congruent with
the common haplotype-like block for these strains. These results
also strengthen our previous confirmation of Canq1 using
association mapping and chromosome substitution strain analysis
[15], and the finding by others [16] of a QTL for cerebral infarct
volume (Civq1) at the same location as Canq1, using an SWRxB6-
F2 cross. Our finding of no other QTL could reflect differences in
size of the F2 population and/or fold-differences in trait (collateral
number) in our SWRxSJL-F2 cross (n = 123 and 6-fold) versus our
previous B6xBc-F2 [15] cross (n = 221 and 30-fold). It could also
reflect the presence of additional smaller-effect loci, which is
supported by the distribution of the collateral number trait (lower
panel of Figure 4).
It is noteworthy that A/J, with its low collateral number (and
diameter, Figure S2), also has some outlier-like haplotype features
(Figure 2). Yet, collateral number and diameter ‘‘follow’’
chromosome 7 by,70% using B6RA/J chromosome substitution
strain (CSS) analysis [15]. And 7 of the EMMA-B genes do not fit
the CSS analysis ‘‘in a simple world’’, eg, Gtf3c1 is indistinguishable
between A/J and B6 except for 1 SNP, whereas A/J and Bc
differ by 166 SNPs (JAX SNP Browser). This would seem to
eliminate Gtf3c1 as a candidate gene, a finding supported by its
lack of differential expression by even t-test analysis (Table S5).
However, compared to the other 20 strains across EMMA-B, A/J
appears as a mix. Some genes are identical to B6 while others are
identical to Bc, in contrast to the impression from looking at the
haplotypes in Figure 2. These considerations emphasize the
likelihood that other known (Canq2-4 [15]) and unknown loci
besides Canq1 are involved.
The most significant EMMA-A region (132.502–132.504 Mb)
lacks mRNA annotation (http://uswest.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus
/Location/View?r = 7:132495610-132513000). This was confirmed
using the UCSC genome browser database. Mammalian
transcription factor binding elements are also lacking (Transcription
Element Search System, TESS, http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/
cgi-bin/tess/tess?RQ = WELCOME). EMMA-A and EMMA-B
(132.495–132.513 Mb) also lack annotated microRNAs and other
nc(non-coding)RNAs (http://www.ncrna.org/). However, 10
genes are annotated in EMMA-B (discussed below), as well as
hundreds of expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Since large-effects QTL like Canq1 are usually accompanied by
changes in expression of the responsible polymorphic gene in the
QTL and/or genes within its effector pathway that are located
elsewhere in the genome, transcript analysis is a critical tool used
to identify candidate genes. We thus measured expression of all 10
of the annotated genes within EMMA-B and 106 genes in the 95%
CI of Canq1 having SNP differences in their coding or regulatory
(62 kb) sequence. RNA was obtained from the pia mater of B6 and
Bc embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5. Although the pia mater is
an approximately 5 mm thick collagen membrane containing
dispersed fibroblasts and IB4 lectin-staining hematopoietic-like
cells, these are greatly outnumbered by the endothelial cells that
compose the arterial trees, pial capillary plexus, and the collateral
circulation that forms during this interval [11,12]. To our
knowledge none of the genes in EMMA-B or those in the wider
95% CI of Canq1 is known to be involved in angiogenesis. Thus,
one or more of the differentially (or not, see below) expressed genes
may be a novel ‘‘collaterogenesis’’ gene that controls, in trans,
expression of a gene(s) located elsewhere in the genome that has
been shown to alter collateral formation, eg, Clic4 (Chr4) [18],
Vegfa [12,17] (Chr17), Flk1 [12] (Chr5), Adam10 [12] (Chr9) and
Adam17 [12] (Chr12).
Nsmce1, Tbx6, Ino80e, Pycard and 3 ‘‘Riken genes’’ within the
95% CI of Canq1 and one located elsewhere (Tert, telomerase) were
differentially expressed greater than 2-fold at all 3 embryonic timepoints
at the highest level of significance (p,0.054150) (Ino80e just
missed this level) (Figure 6, Table 1). The EMMA-B gene Nsmce1
(non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (Smc) element-1;
Nse1) was 5-fold greater in Bc than B6 (2nd largest fold-difference
among the 150 transcripts assayed). Nsmce1 is part of a multiprotein
complex important in telomere maintenance during
proliferation, compensation for telomerase deficiency, inhibition
of apoptosis, and promotion of cell survival [38–42]. These
functions may be important in collaterogenesis.
Tbx6 (T-box-6 transcription factor) is required for mesoderm,
somite and left-right body axis specification that involves Wnt/bcatenin
and BMP/TGFb1RNotch/Delta signaling [43,44].
Cross-talk exists among the Tbox, Wnt/b-catenin, TGFb1, VEGF
and Notch pathways [45–47]. Although no information is
available regarding interaction between Tbx6 and Vegfa, this is
well-established for Tbx1 [48] and less-so with Tbx2 [49]. Evidence
that VEGF-A/Flk1RDelta/Notch drives collateral formation
[12], together with the above findings, identify Tbx6 as a
candidate.
Ino80e (regulator of inositol responsive gene expression; Ccdc95)
in human is one of the 16 subunits of the INO80 chromatin
remodeling complex. INO80 controls transcription of genes that
regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and embryonic development
, as well as DNA replication, repair and telomerase activity
[50,51]. Thus Ino80e, Nsmce1 and Jmjd5 (below) are attractive
epigenetic candidates capable of regulating multiple genes.
Pycard (apoptosis speck-like protein containing a C-terminal
caspase recruitment domain; ASC) was the most strongly
downregulated gene in Bc with the lowest p-value (0.00004)
among the 127 Canq1 transcripts examined (Table 1). Pycard is an
adaptor protein for NLRP3 (nucleotide binding leucine rich
repeats-containing protein 3) that is increased by cell-stress stimuli
and required for formation of the multi-protein inflammasome
complex, which is induced in activated macrophages and causes
interleukin secretion, additional macrophage recruitment, and
caspase-1-mediated apoptosis [52–54].
The Riken ESTs D430042O09Rik, 9130019O22Rik and
B230325K18Rik may be ESTs for long-ncRNA ‘‘genes’’ [55–57].
Although little annotation is available for this relatively new family
of RNA genes, databases www.biogps.org and www.nextbio.com/
bodyatlas show the following: D430042O09Rik is ubiquitously
expressed and greater in Bc that B6 tissues, and has conserved
homology through C elegans; 9130019O22Rik is ubiquitously
expressed at comparable levels in both strains; B230325K18Rik is
comparable in Bc and B6. If these loci function as lncRNAs they
could regulate one or multiple genes involved in collateral
formation and maintenance.
Jmjd5, located just 39 to EMMA-B, was not differentially
expressed. However, a loss-of-function or gain-of-function variant
in a gene could be important yet not be accompanied by a change
in expression. Jmjd5 (jumongi domain-containing protein 5; lysinespecific
demethylase 8) is a newly discovered member of the
jumongi-C domain-containing proteins that are receiving considerably
attention [58–60]. Some JmjC proteins are histone
demethylases involved in epigenetic regulation. Although nothing
is known about mouse Jmjd5 function, human JMJD5 (aka
KDM8) is a H3 lysine36 demethylase and transcriptional activator

of cyclin A1 that is required for cell cycle progression and is a
potential tumor suppressor. Given the rapidly expanding roles for
histone demethylases in controlling coordinate expression of
multiple genes within a pathway, Jmjd5 is a candidate gene.
In our previous study [15] we examined all genes in the 95%
confidence interval of Canq1 using Ingenuity Pathway Enrichment
Analysis. Thirteen of 20 known pathways showed significance
(p,0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg), with cell-cell signaling and
immune response pathways showing the greatest enrichment.
However, no additional referenced gene connections were
identified beyond those discussed above.
We also measured expression of 13 genes that control
angiogenesis and 10 involved in endothelial cell proliferation that
reside outside of Canq1. Only Tert (a protein component of
telomere reverse transcriptase (telomerase)) was significantly
differentially expressed. Increased expression of this chromosome-stabilizing
, anti-aging/cell-survival protein [61] in Bc mice
may be part of a compensatory pathway activated by deficiencies
in an above-mentioned gene(s) that are predisposing to failure to
form or loss of nascent collaterals during embryogenesis.
Telomere-independent functions have also been recently identified
for telormerase [62]. Telomerase is a cofactor in the b-catenin
transcriptional complex, facilitating canonical Wnt signaling in vitro
and in vivo. Its RNA polymerase activity may amplify certain
ncRNAs, including promoting the generation of siRNAs. Moreover
, increased expression of telomerase sensitizes mitochondrial
DNA to oxidative damage and stimulates apoptosis. Thus, a
polymorphism in Canq1 may, secondarily or in trans, increase
expression of telomerase in pial vessels of Bc embryos and
contribute to reduced collateral formation and increased pruning.
It is also intriguing that Nsmce1 and Ino80e interact with
telomerase (discussed above), and that TGFb1 and VEGF/Notch
signaling are known to have significant cross talk with Wnt/bcatenin
signaling [46].
Previously annotated mouse QTL identified within Canq1
(128.3–142.2, MGI Mouse Genome Browser, Build 37) are
unrelated to the collateral phenotype: Alcp12 (alcohol preference
,B6xA/J); coronin (actin binding protein-1A, B6xBXSB), lupus
susceptibility (BXSB); Myo1 (myocardial infarction susceptibility,
BXSBxNZW, 142.2-extreme 39 of Canq1); Mob1, (multigenic
obesity, SpretxBc), Rthyd1 (resistant to thymic deletion-1); Scc12
(susceptibility to colon cancer 12); Sluc19 (susceptibility to lung
cancer-19); Vpantd (valproic acid-induced neural tube defect); Dice2
(determination of IL4 commitment-2, B6xBc); Il4ppq (IL4
producing potential QTL, B6xBXSB, NZBxNZW, presumed
same as Dice2); Tsiq1 (T cell secretion of IL4-1m, presumed same
as Dice2). Regarding the latter 3 QTL, Bc mice have ,50-fold
increased levels of IL4 compared to other strains, associated with a
loss-of-function mutation which may explain their reduced mRNA
(Fig. 6; Table S4) if resulting from negative feedback. No QTL or
eQTL have been identified within the human genome syntenic to
the Canq1 interval, including in the 8 Mb flanking region
(16p12.3-11.2/10q25-26.3) for the following traits: collateral
circulation, stroke, ischemic stroke, cerebral circulation, coronary
artery disease, angina, coronary ischemia, coronary circulation,
coronary blood flow, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery
disease, intermittent claudication (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim;
www.genome.gov/gwastudies/). The UCSC database identifies
mir-762 at 134.85 and mir-1962 at the extreme 39 position
(142.8 Mb) of Canq1. In-situ hybridization of mir-762 was
insufficient to permit structural assignment in the E14.5 mouse
transcriptone atlas (http://www.eurexpress.org). The http://
www.mirbase.org/ database lists only 3 deep-sequencing reads
for miR-762 (1 in testes, 2 in brain). Since a miRNA of vascular
importance would be expected to be reasonably expressed in most
if not all tissues, these reports of very low expression in highly
restricted tissue cDNAs, compared to other miRNAs, argue
against the importance of mir-762 in Canq1.
Conclusions based on analysis of knockout mice and gene
expression have limitations, including compensations from global
deletion, difficulty in distinguishing gain-of-function variants, and
altered expression dependent on changes elsewhere in the genome.
In this regard, expression of Flk1 and Clic4 were not different in Bc
and B6 embryos (Tables S3, S4, S5) despite their involvement in
collateral formation based on targeted disruption [12,17,18].
In summary, the present results significantly narrow and
prioritize the large number of candidate genes previously reported
for the co-localized QTL Canq1 [15] Civq1 [16] and HSq1 [19].
Additional studies sequencing EMMA-B and the wider Canq1
interval in several strains with high and low collateral extent,
generation of congenic strains partitioning EMMA and Canq1, and
other approaches to investigate the above candidate genes, will be
needed to identify the basis for this important locus for geneticdependent
variation in the collateral circulation.

ligation (FAL), indicating as in the pial circulation no
effect on native collateral extent in skeletal muscle. See
Chalothorn and Faber [11] for Materials and Methods. IL-4, but
not Itgal knockout mice, show deficits in recovery of perfusion and
greater tissue ischemia and use-impairment with days after FAL.
These deficiencies suggest impaired collateral remodeling, although
lesser potential contributions could include less ischemic
capillary angiogenesis and/or less reduction in resistance (smooth
muscle tone or anatomic outward remodeling) upstream of,
downstream of, or within the recruited hindlimb collateral
network.

Itgal knockouts show significant increases in cell counts for white
blood cells, lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes, while
platelet count is lower. *,**,*** p,0.05, 0.01, 0.001. Dunne et al
and Ding et al reported similar increases in the above blood cell
types in Itgal deficient mice, eg 3-fold for total leukocytes, 4-fold
for PMNs, and 2.5-fold for mononuclear cells, but did not report
platelets. Regarding the decrease in platelets, we have been unable
to find any previous report that circulating platelet number is
decreased in Itgal2/2 mice. However, Armugam et al reported
that platelet adhesion to cerebral venules after MCA occlusion and
reperfusion is 50% less in LFA2/2 mice. Emoto et al found that
platelets were reduced in livers following low dose LPS challenge
in LFA2/2 mice. Dunne JL, Collins RG, Beaudet AL,
