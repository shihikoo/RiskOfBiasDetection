Many neurological and psychiatric maladies originate from the deprivation of the human brain from estrogens.
However, current hormone therapies cannot be used safely to treat these conditions commonly associated with
menopause because of detrimental side effects in the periphery. The latter also prevents the use of the hormone
for neuroprotection. We show that a small-molecule bioprecursor prodrug, 10b,17b-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one
(DHED), converts to 17b-estradiol in the brain after systemic administration but remains inert in the rest of the body.
The localized and rapid formation of estrogen from the prodrug was revealed by a series of in vivo bioanalytical
assays and through in vivo imaging in rodents. DHED treatment efficiently alleviated symptoms that originated
from brain estrogen deficiency in animal models of surgical menopause and provided neuroprotection in a rat
stroke model. Concomitantly, we determined that 17b-estradiol formed in the brain from DHED elicited changes
in gene expression and neuronal morphology identical to those obtained after direct 17b-estradiol treatment.
Together, complementary functional and mechanistic data show that our approach is highly relevant therapeutically
, because administration of the prodrug selectively produces estrogen in the brain independently from the
route of administration and treatment regimen. Therefore, peripheral responses associated with the use of systemic
estrogens, such as stimulation of the uterus and estrogen-responsive tumor growth, were absent. Collectively, our
brain-selective prodrug approach may safely provide estrogen neuroprotection and medicate neurological and psychiatric
symptoms developing from estrogen deficiency, particularly those encountered after surgical menopause,
without the adverse side effects of current hormone therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Estrogen deficiency in the human brain causes numerous neurological
and psychiatric symptoms (1). Hormone therapies, including systemically
administered 17b-estradiol (E2, the main human estrogen),
alleviate these conditions (2). E
2
has also been shown to provide neuroprotection
, as one of its best-documented nonreproductive functions
, in animals (3). However, the full potential of the hormone for
the treatment of estrogen-responsive central maladies cannot be realized
in clinical settings until its actions are restricted to the brain.
This is needed to ensure therapeutic safety, because adverse peripheral
impact of estrogens has halted large-scale clinical trials investigating
the long-term health benefits of hormone therapies based on equine
estrogens (4). Many women discontinued these therapies or avoid starting
them, which potentially increases the risks of poor brain health even
in conditions where benefits of estrogen have been shown (5, 6). Therefore
, novel therapies providing effective and safe treatment of the brain
with estrogen remain an unmet need in medicine.
Elevated circulating estrogen levels and associated risks for harmful
peripheral side effects are unavoidable with currently approved estrogen
medications, even when human estrogen is prescribed (7). The development
of brain-selective estrogen therapies has been, however, a
formidable challenge. Efforts to discover neuroselective estrogen receptor
(ER) modulators are still focused mainly on a few well-known phytoestrogens
(8), and metabolism of these compounds is variable (9). A
recent development of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)–E
2
conjugate
has shown potential brain delivery through dual-hormone action
to improve energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism (10). The approach
targets cells that, besides ERs, also express GLP-1 receptors. Therefore,
suprahypothalamic areas of the central nervous system (CNS) involved
in many estrogen deficiency–derived neurological and psychiatric symptoms
(6, 11) are not affected, because ER-expressing cells that coexpress
GLP-1 receptors are localized only in the hypothalamus and the brainstem.
An additional caveat of the method is due to key technical hurdles
involved in the pharmaceutical development of effective peptide-based
agents—including but not limited to manufacture, oral absorption,
metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics, and formulation—compared with
small-molecule drugs.
Hence, selective delivery of E
2
into the brain through a simple smallmolecule
strategy would be of immediate practical relevance. Prodrug
approaches to achieve this goal have, however, remained unsuccessful.
Prodrugs are inactive derivatives of therapeutic agents that are converted
to the biologically active parent drug by enzymatic and/or chemical

transformations in vivo (12). They are commonly developed to resolve
pharmacokinetic, toxicity, formulation, and drug delivery limitations.
A redox chemical delivery system, which applies the prodrug principle
(12), has been proposed for enhanced delivery of E
2
to the brain (13).
Although this method provides increased selectivity in CNS delivery
of the hormone, it still generates elevated levels of the hormone in the
periphery with substantial uterotrophic side effects and sustained high
circulating estrogen levels even after acute dosing (14, 15).
Our studies on the antioxidant mechanism of estrogen neuroprotection
(16) inspired the hypothesis that 10b,17b-dihydroxyestra-1,4-
dien-3-one (DHED) could serve as a bioprecursor prodrug of E
2
with
preferential bioactivation to E
2
in the brain to fulfill the unmet need
for brain-selective estrogen therapy. Unlike classical prodrugs, bioprecursor
prodrugs do not contain auxiliary “promoieties”but are created
via a transient chemical alteration within the drug molecule itself (12).
As an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound, DHED is a plausible substrate
for a short-chain NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate)–dependent dehydrogenase/reductase (17)
that is selectively expressed in the brain and linked to neuroprotection
(18). Using a series of bioanalytical and imaging assessments, evaluating
gene expression, morphology, and neuropharmacological responses
in several rodent models of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we
show here that DHED selectively converts into E
2
only in the brain after
systemic administration. We reveal the therapeutic potential of DHED
on estrogen deficiency–associated neurological disorders and psychiatric
conditions without encountering adverse systemic actions that are typically
seen with the direct use of estrogens.
RESULTS
DHED conversion to estrogen (E
2
)
DHED is a bioprecursor prodrug that is converted to E
2
by a shortchain
dehydrogenase/reductase (Fig. 1A). The reductive bioactivation
of DHED to E
2
proceeds through hydride transfer from the coenzyme
NADPH to the C1 position of the C1-C2 double bond of DHED’sA-
ring that is conjugated to the 3-carbonyl group. This b-addition is
followed by spontaneous water elimination involving the 10(b)-OH.
Our computer-aided mechanistic study fully supported this pathway
of DHED’s reductive bioactivation (Fig. 1B). The first, enzyme-catalyzed
hydride-transfer step leads to an intermediate through a transition state
(which may be considered a resonance hybrid of the substrate-coenzyme
and intermediate-oxidized coenzyme complexes shown in brackets)
that is endergonic, with DG° of +2.1 kcal/mol. The subsequent water
elimination is immensely exergonic (DG°of−10.3 kcal/mol); hence, it
proceeds spontaneously, making the overall process also exergonic with
DG°of−8.2 kcal/mol. The obtained phenolate form of E
2
(E
2
−)isin
acid-base equilibrium with the non-ionized (neutral) form of the hormone
dictated by pH, and the neutral form predominates in equilibrium
at physiological pH. Together, DHED’s reductive bioactivation
proceeds in an opposite direction compared to the well-known oxidative
process converting an androgen to estrogen catalyzed by aromatase
(19). In the latter case, three sequential steps of substrate oxidation
involving molecular oxygen and the transfer of six electrons are necessary
for estrogen formation from androgens (Fig. 1C).
Table 1 summarizes key physicochemical, pharmacological, and
biopharmaceutical properties of DHED in comparison with those of E
2
.
DHED is inactive as an estrogen because it has no measurable affinity
to the classical ERs and does not show the well-known antioxidant
activity of the hormone (16). Its lipophilicity and binding to human
plasma proteins are significantly decreased, whereas its water solubility
is increased compared with E
2
. All these are great advantages over E
2
in terms of bioavailability and formulation.
DHED metabolizes to E
2
only in the brain
In vitro metabolism studies were conducted by adding the prodrug to
freshly prepared tissue homogenates. DHED was preferentially activated
to E
2
in the brain compared with estrogen-sensitive peripheral
tissues, such as the uterus (Fig. 2A and fig. S1). Besides E

produce estrogen in the circulation and peripheral tissues, as shown by
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays
developed to distinguish different isotopic forms of the hormone.
We also did not detect DHED in the brain, which indicated its rapid
metabolism in this organ. Oral (fig. S2, A and B) and subcutaneous
(fig. S2, C and D) administrations of the prodrug generated results similar
to those obtained upon intravenous injection (Fig. 2B). These
findings revealed that the increase of E
2
in the brain after DHED
treatment (Fig. 2B and fig. S2, A to C) originated from the conversion
of the prodrug to E
2
—and not from the stimulation of endogenous
hormone synthesis.
Results of detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) studies measuring E
2
concentrations in the brain and serum not only demonstrated a rapid
uptake of DHED into the brain after systemic administration but also
indicated its complete absorption after oral administration (table S1).
In vivo experiments using OVX repTOP ERE-Luc mice, in which luciferase
expression is under the transcriptional control of ERs (20),
also confirmed that prodrug treatments did not activate the ERE reporter
construct and failed to generate bioluminescence in peripheral
tissues accessible to in vivo imaging, even at high subcutaneous or oral
doses (≥200 mg/kg) (fig. S3A). DHED was therefore not converted to
E
2
in the periphery. In contrast, mice treated subcutaneously with E
2
at a dose of 20 mg/kg resulted in a significant increase of photon emission
from the hepatic area (fig. S3B). Intracerebroventricular administration
followed by ex vivo bioluminescence imaging of OVX
repTOP ERE-Luc mice brain slices also revealed local estrogen formation
from DHED (fig. S3C). The conversion occurred in all brain
areas, with the cortical areas showing the highest extent of DHED
bioactivation in this model, confirming our in vitro metabolism studies
in OVX rat brain tissues (Fig. 2A).
DHED treatment is neuroprotective and elicits estrogen-responsive
neuropharmacological effects in rodent models of CNS diseases
We next evaluated the translational potential of DHED treatment in
preclinical models of estrogen-responsive human CNS disorders, including
stroke, depression, hot flushes, and cognitive decline (21), in OVX
rodents. Dose-dependent reduction of infarct volumes and attenuation
of neurological deficits in animal models of stroke have been used frequently
to quantify the extent of neuroprotection elicited by singledose
estrogens (16, 22). We used the most common paradigm, the
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model followed
by reperfusion, in our initial proof-of-concept studies. Neuroprotection
was manifested by a dose-dependent reduction of the infarct volumes in
DHED-treated animals (Fig. 3A), with concomitant attenuation of
Fig. 3. DHED treatment elicits neuroprotection in a rat model of ischemic
stroke.(A) OVX Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with DHED (0.8 to 100mg/kg,
subcutaneously) 1 hour before tMCAO followed by 24-hour reperfusion. The E

treated group received 200 mg/kg, subcutaneously. TCC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride)–stained brain sections are representative of three animals per indicated
treatment and from the same animals within each column. Pale-colored regions

neurological deficits (Fig. 3B). The effective subcutaneous dose (ED
50
,
equivalent to 50% of the maximum effect) was about 15 mg/kg; nearly
10-fold higher systemic E
2
dose was needed to achieve the same protection
against ischemic injury. These data indicate that the prodrug
was significantly more potent to deliver E
2
into the brain than direct
administration of the hormone. The ischemic brain retained its capacity
to generate E
2
from the prodrug (Fig. 3C) and, therefore, even postinfarct
DHED treatment had a neuroprotective effect (Fig. 3, D and E).
OVX rodents are highly responsive to estrogen, and the forced swim
test (FST) using this model is widely used to screen for antidepressantlike
activity (23). When administered at identical doses, DHED treatments
outperformed direct administration of E
2
in the FST (Fig. 4A). The
high-affinity ER antagonist ICI 182,780 completely blocked this antidepressant-like
effect in both treatment groups (Fig. 4B), suggesting an
ER-mediated mechanism. In support, we detected a significant amount
of ICI 182,780 in the brain (6.6 ± 0.9 ng/g tissue) by LC-MS/MS 15 min
after completion of the FST. These data confirm the ability of this ER
antagonist to enter the brain after systemic administration (24).
We demonstrated similar efficacy of DHED treatment in additional
animal models of menopause-associated neurological disorders. In a
rat hot flush model (25), oral DHED treatment blunted the tail-skin
temperature rise (Fig. 4C) using an orally bioavailable synthetic estrogen
[17a-ethinylestradiol (EE)] as a positive control. In another animal
model testing cognitive impairment owing to estrogen deficiency (26),
we also measured the beneficial effect of DHED treatment. Continuous
, long-term subcutaneous administration of DHED significantly
decreased working memory errors committed by OVX middle-aged
rats compared to control animals in a delay match-to-sample (DMS)
plus maze test (Fig. 4D).
DHED treatments produce markers of estrogenic effects
in the brain
To further validate that DHED delivery to the brain and its subsequent
conversion to E
2
had functional and potentially therapeutic relevance,
we assayed for clinically relevant markers of estrogenic effects on the
brain (26–28). DHED treatment stimulated progesterone receptor (PR)
expression in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (Fig. 5A), increased
choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) stereological cell
counts in the medial septum and vertical diagonal band (Fig. 5B), and
increased the number of dendritic spines and spine heads in hippocampal
CA1 neurons (Fig. 5C), all compared with vehicle control treatment.
These changes in the brain were indistinguishable from those
seen after direct subcutaneous estrogen treatment at the same concentration.
ICI 182,780 abolished the effect of DHED treatment on PR
induction (Fig. 5A), which suggested that this response was indeed due
to estrogen formed in situ from DHED.
DHED treatment does not have
uterotrophic effects or promote
proliferation of cancerous tissue
In addition to sparing the liver from estrogen
exposure (fig. S3, A and B), DHED
treatment did not result in wet uterus
weight gain (Fig. 6A), which is a uterotrophic
effect of systemically administered
estrogens (15, 29). This was independent
of the route of administration (intravenous,
subcutaneous, or oral) (fig. S4) and also
did not occur after continuous, long-term
(48-day) delivery of DHED using subcutaneous
osmotic minipumps (fig. S4C).
For these experiments, vaginal smears
and standard cytology were used to confirm
that all OVX animals were in diestrus
before E
2
and DHED treatments were
initiated. During and after DHED treatment
, all animals in the DHED groups
remained continuously in diestrus similar
to those in the OVX control group, whereas
all E
2
-treated rats exhibited vaginal smears
with many cornified cells, indicating systemic
estrogen exposure. In addition, although
many protein markers are up- and
down-regulated by exogenous E
2
(30), there
were no changes in the expression of a broad
panel of estrogen-regulated uterine proteins
compared with control after DHED
treatment (Fig. 6B and fig. S5).
Another undesired consequence of
increasing estrogen in the peripheral circulation
is its effect on cancerous breast

and the aromatase substrate D4-androstenedione (D4A) induced
the expected cancer-promoting ERa transactivation in cultured
human MCF-7Ca cells (31), whereas DHED did not (Fig. 6C). Unlike
D4A, DHED treatment also did not stimulate the growth of aromatasetransfected
MCF-7Ca breast cancer cells in vivo in a nude mouse xenograft
model (Fig. 6D), indicating that DHED indeed remained inert
in these cells.
DISCUSSION
Estrogen-based therapies have remained the most effective remedies
to treat menopausal indications; however, they are neither appropriate
nor desirable for all symptomatic women. For example, estrogens are
contraindicated after preventive oophorectomy (1, 32), which is increasingly
performed in gynecological oncology. Therefore, a growing
population of women will not have effective and safe treatment against
neurological and psychiatric maladies triggered by estrogen deficiency
of the brain owing to surgical menopause (33).Toaddressthismajor
unmet medical need, we explored a new prodrug, DHED, that remains
inert in the body—only to be quickly converted to estrogen in the brain.
Evidence provided here indicates that the reductive bioactivation of
DHED to estrogen is brain-selectiveinfemaleanimalmodels,which
could offer unique benefits to the treatment of human diseases associated
with brain estrogen deficiency or for those benefiting from
estrogen-mediated neuroprotection.
Adverse consequences of estrogen deficiency in the human brain
have been seen inevitably and most markedly upon bilateral oophorectomy
performed before reproductive senescence, which precipitates premature
menopause. Symptoms of premature menopause and also of menopause
resulting from reproductive senescence include, among others, hot
flushes, depression, cognitive impairment, and an increased risk of ischemic
stroke (5, 6, 34). Consequently, we chose widely accepted animal
models of these human conditions to evaluate our DHED-based
brain-selective intervention for a direct, side-by-side comparison with
estrogen therapy. Collectively, our results indicate that DHED enters
the brain of OVX rodents, where it is rapidly metabolized to the main
estrogen, E
2
. In estrogen-sensitive peripheral tissues and in the circulation
, DHED is not converted to E
2
and, thus, remains inert. Rapid
metabolism of this prodrug to the hormone in the brain also explained
why brain levels of DHED were undetectable. Overall, the significant
elevation of brain E
2
levels after DHED treatments originated solely
from the metabolism of the inactive bioprecursor and not from DHED-
induced E
2
biosynthesis.
In addition to abolishing affinity to ER and to other steroid receptors
, the unique structural attributes (that is, a cyclohexadienone A-ring
and the oxidatively added 10b-hydroxyl group) also favorably change
key physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of DHED in
comparison with those of E
2
. The benefits of these changes are shown
in this study through rodent models demonstrating delivery of E
2
to the
brain without toxic and uterotrophic systemic side effects seen for exogenous
estrogen treatments. Compared to DHED treatment, an order

of magnitude higher dose of estrogen was needed to generate a similar
extent of neuroprotection and neuropharmacological responses in animal
models of estrogen deficiency. This finding highlights brain-selective
E
2
therapybyDHEDasabetter“drug economy”; that is, it focuses the
biologically active estrogen to the brain—unlike systemic treatment
with E
2
that distributes the hormone throughout the entire body.
DHED-based E
2
therapy was more efficacious than direct E
2
administration
in a cerebrovascular stroke model. This improvement is
attributed to the favorable physicochemical properties of DHED for
blood-brain barrier transport from the circulation and based on mechanisms
by which estrogens are known to protect neurons against ischemic
injury. As expected from in vitro experiments indicating DHED
bioactivation by the ischemic tissue, we also observed significant neuroprotection
even when the animals received DHED up to 2 hours after the
stroke. These additional results may expand the potential benefits of
brain-selective estrogen therapy from stroke prevention in surgically
menopausal women to effective post-stroke medication for all patients.
E
2
has been shown to alleviate depression-like condition precipitated
by a hypoestrogenic state in mice (23), and the antidepressant
activity of the hormone is due to a multimodal
mechanism of action involving
the regulation of several pathways and functions
(11). DHED treatment profoundly
reduced behavioral immobility, which
was reversible by an ER antagonist, the
latter indicating that, similar to E
2
treatment
, an estrogen was responsible for the
observed pharmacological response. In
our preclinical evaluation, DHED administration
was also effective in an established
rat model of hot flushes (25), which are
prevalent and long lasting during the menopause
transition (35).
AdropinE
2
levels after surgical menopause
also may affect key parts of the
brain responsible for memory and concentration
, including the hippocampus,
which has been shown to be associated
with cognitive impairment (21, 36). In
young adult and middle-aged female rats,
ovarian hormone loss induces cognitive
impairment that can be reversed by systemic
estrogen treatment (26). In our study,
middle-aged rats committed significantly
fewer working memory errors in a DMS
plus maze test after chronic administration
of DHED than did the OVX control animals.
The increase in brain E2after systemic
DHED treatment appeared to have no
direct effect on hippocampal estrogen biosynthesis.
In subsequent experiments
complementing the neuropharmacological
assessments, we showed that E
2
generated
from DHED in the brain produced the
expression of characteristic markers indicating
central estrogenic effects, and DHED-
treated groups were indistinguishable from
the E2-treated control groups.
In current clinical practice, chronic hormone therapies require the
use of a progestin to counterbalance the detrimental impact of estrogens
on the endometrium. Progestins, however, have been shown to interfere
with the beneficial effect of estrogens in the brain (37). Consistent
with no change in circulating E
2
levels after DHED treatments,
OVX rodents did not display E
2
-induced uterotrophic effects when
dosed with DHED. All systemically estrogen-treated animals in our
experiments showed the expected uterotrophic effect. The lack of uterine
response upon DHED treatment was confirmed using proteomic
markers of E
2
activity. Overall, uterine protein expression was not different
between the DHED- and vehicle-treated groups. Thus, the lack
of DHED’s uterotrophic activity would obviate the need for coadministration
of a progestin.
The induction of aromatase-dependent breast cancer has also
been considered a serious risk of current estrogen therapies often contraindicating
their use to manage symptoms of menopause clinically
(33). However, DHED-treated cells did not show ERa transactivation
in vitro or stimulate MCF-7Ca xenografts in vivo. In further support
of the inherent inertness and safety of DHED, we found that the liver

was not exposed to estrogen after DHED treatment even at high oral
doses (≥200 mg/kg). In contrast, subcutaneous administration of E
2
even at 1/
10
th of DHED’s dose showed the expected profound ER activation
in the liver—a common hepatic side effect of current estrogen
therapies.
Collectively, our comprehensive and multidisciplinary preclinical
studies have revealed that E
2
’s activity may be effectively confined to
the brain of female rodents through the unique metabolism of a systemically
administered bioprecursor prodrug. DHED has excellent oral
bioavailability, which is a requirement along with additional drug-like
properties, such as appropriate lipophilicity, reduced plasma-protein
binding, and increased solubility in water, for successful pharmaceutical
development. Our study indicates the translational potential of DHED
for brain-selective estrogen therapy, especially to remedy neurological
and psychiatric symptoms of early and surgical menopause, and potentially
also in a wide range of human diseases associated with estrogen
deficiency or benefiting from estrogen-mediated protection of the brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This preclinical study was designed to test the ability of DHED to selectively
metabolize to E
2
in the brain and thereby provide brainselective
estrogen therapy. In vitro metabolism studies were performed
using homogenates prepared from both healthy and diseased rat tissues.
PK studies (with intravenous, subcutaneous, and oral dosing)
measuring prodrug and estrogen concentrations, respectively, in target
tissues and serum were carried out for proof of concept. Complementary
in vivo imaging was done using various routes of prodrug
administration (subcutaneous, oral, and intracerebroventricular). Confirmatory
pharmacological assessments and assessment of markers revealing
estrogenic effects were performed in animal models known to
respond to exogenously administered E
2
. These paradigms enabled the
direct comparison between the prodrug (DHED) and the parent drug
(E
2
) to highlight the distinguishing and unique properties of DHED in
terms of brain-selective estrogen therapy (end points). For each experiment
, sample sizes were chosen to minimize the number of OVX animals
needed while obtaining sufficient statistical power. Treatment
duration and dosage regimen were selected on the basis of published
experiments involving estrogens after considering drug-like properties
of DHED from in silico predictions and experimental measurements.
Assays were carried out by blinded investigators.
Chemicals
The method used for the synthesis of DHED was based on a procedure
adapted from the literature (38)usingE

3
-andd
5
-
DHED) according to a previously reported microwave-assisted procedure
(39). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from
commercial vendors.
Characterization of DHED
Steroid receptor-binding experiments were performed by Caliper Life
Sciences. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was assayed in triplicate by
the FTC and TBARS methods (40). Binding to human plasma proteins
was measured by rapid equilibrium dialysis (with a single-use
dialysis plate with inserts, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The logarithm of n-octanol/water partition coefficient
(logP) was predicted by the method incorporated into the
BioMedCAChe program (version 6.1, Fujitsu America Inc.) and was
verified experimentally by the shake flask technique. Intrinsic water
solubility (S
w
) was measured in deionized water at 25°C and using
an equilibrium solubility method adopted from an earlier procedure
(41) by performing quantitative LC-MS/MS analyses (40).
In vitro metabolic conversions of DHED to E
2
Initial in vitro conversion rates in freshly prepared 20% (w/v) OVX rat
tissue homogenates were measured by the procedure and analytical
method described previously (16). Assays were performed in triplicate
after addition of d

-E
2
from stock solution to reach internal standard
concentration equivalent to 2 mM in the sample. Liquid-liquid extraction
and quantitation by isotope dilution LC-MS/MS were done as
reported before (40).
Animal treatments and monitoring
Saline and corn or sesame oil vehicles were used for intravenous and
subcutaneous injections, respectively, whereas compounds were delivered
by gavage in a saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle
upon oral administration. PBS also served as a vehicle for intracerebroventricular
injection. E
2
, EE, and DHED stock solutions were prepared
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol, which were admixed to the
vehicles. Concentrations in the stock solutions and mixing ratios were
chosen to keep the percentage of the organic co-solvent at a minimum
while avoiding the precipitation of the compounds. For DHED, this
represented ≤3% (v/v) of DMSO or ethanol in the administrationready
solutions. For continuous subcutaneous administration by ALZET
osmotic pumps (model 2ML4 rated for delivery at 0.25 ± 0.05 ml/hour
for 28 days; Durect Corp.), E
2
or DHED was dissolved in propylene
glycol. For control rats, pumps were filled only with propylene glycol.
Pump insertion was done 18 days after ovariectomy under vaporized
isoflurane anesthesia according to the surgical procedure recommended
by the manufacturer. We replaced the pumps with freshly filled new
ones after 15 days of delivery; this ensured that all animals had their
assigned substrate delivered for the duration of behavioral testing and
through euthanasia 48 days after the surgical insertion of the first
pump. During the infusion period, we examined vaginal smears
according to a previously reported procedure (42). Transgenic Operative
Products srl performed the experiments involving repTOP
ERE-Luc mice, for which the animals were fed a special estrogen-free
diet (43).
Drug distribution in vivo
In vivo microdialysis experiments were performed as described previously
(44). Measurements from serum and brain tissue were made
after dissecting the brain into regions, homogenization, liquid-liquid

for quantification by isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS (45). DHED analyses
were carried out in separate LC-MS/MS assays using a Supelco Discovery
HS C18 column, 50 mm × 2.1 mm, packed with 5-mm particles.

-DHED) in the
effluent were detected by ion trap (LTQ) or triple-quadrupole (TSQ
Quantum Ultra, Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometers equipped with
ESI sources operated in the positive ionization mode. Quantifications
were performed, similar to those of estrogens (45), by isotope-dilution
MS/MS. Protein contents in tissues were measured by a dye-binding
assay (Thermo Scientific). Noncompartmental PK analyses (46)were
performed by nonlinear curve fitting using Scientist for Windows
(Micromath).
Focal ischemia/tMCAO-reperfusion injury model
Experiments were performed as previously described (47), and the
infarct volumes were measured after 1 hour of tMCAO followed
by 24-hour reperfusion. Vehicle, E
2
, and DHED were injected subcutaneously
1 hour before tMCAO in the stroke prevention study, whereas
DHED injections (100 mg/kg, subcutaneously) were also administered
immediately upon starting reperfusion (that is, 1 hour after tMCAO),
as well as 1 and 2 hours thereafter (2 and 3 hours after tMCAO, respectively
). The harvested brains were kept in ice-cold saline for 5 min,
after which seven coronal slices (2-mm thickness) were cut from each
brainfor15-minincubationin2%TCCsolutionat37°C.Infarctvolume
was determined from measurements performed using the ImageJ
software (U.S. National Institutes of Health). Neurological deficits
were assessed and scored as follows: 0, normal (that is, no neurological
deficit observed); 1, mild impairment (the animal failed to extend the
contralateral forepaw on lifting the whole body by the tail); 2, moderate
impairment (the animal circled contralaterally); 3, severe impairment
(the animal leaned contralaterally when resting).
Computational study
All computations were performed with the SCIGRESS molecular
modeling suit (version 2.6; Fujitsu–FQS Poland). Structures for ground
and transition states were calculated using the PM6 and PM6-TS semiempirical
quantum chemical parameterizationsoftheMolecularOrbital
Package (MOPAC, Stewart Computational Chemistry) (48). The
conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used to simulate continuum
solvation in water (with the e permittivity parameter set to
78.4) (49). Thermodynamic quantities were calculated with the THERMO
program of MOPAC.
Statistical analysis
We applied Shapiro-Wilk tests, visual inspections of histograms, normal
Q-Q plots, and box plots to confirm normal distribution of data.
Statistical evaluations were done by one-way ANOVA in all but one
experiment (effect on MCF-7Ca breast cancer xenografts in athymic
nude mice, where we used repeated-measures two-way ANOVA). All
of our follow-up, two-group comparisons used SNK post hoc tests
when a significant omnibus ANOVA (with two-tailed a set to 0.05)
was found, noting that type I error correction was not necessary with
orthogonal planned comparisons (50). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
