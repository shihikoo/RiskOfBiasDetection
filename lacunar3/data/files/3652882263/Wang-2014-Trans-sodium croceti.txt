a b s t r a c t 
Trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC) is a novel carotenoid compound capable of enhancing the
diffusion of small molecules in aqueous solutions. TSC improves the diffusion of oxygen
and glucose, and increases oxygenation in ischemic brain tissue. TSC also dampens the
intensity of an ischemic challenge during an ongoing ischemic event. The current study
examined the impact of TSC in rat models of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Rat three
vessel occlusion (3VO), and combined 3VO and one vessel occlusion (3VO/1VO) models of
ischemic stroke were evaluated for structural and behavioral outcomes. The effects of TSC
were also tested in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Delayed treatment with
TSC reduced infarct volume in a rodent model of transient focal ischemia involving either 2
or 6 h of ischemia. Neurological outcomes, based on a multi-scale assessment and
automated gait analysis, also were improved by TSC treatment. Additionally, TSC reduced
edema and hemorrhagic volume in a rat model of ICH. An optimal therapeutic candidate
for early intervention in ischemic stroke should be effective when administered on a
delayed basis and should not aggravate outcomes associated with hemorrhagic stroke. The
current findings demonstrate that delayed TSC treatment improves outcomes in experimental
models of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Together, these findings suggest
that TSC may be a safe and beneficial therapeutic modality for early stroke intervention,
irrespective of the type of stroke involved.

1. Introduction
Emergency care for stroke must discriminate between ischemic
and hemorrhagic strokes in order to safely manage the patient.
Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is currently the only
FDA-approved therapeutic for the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke (NINDs rt-PA STROKE STUDY GROUP, 1995). However,
critical limitations to the utility of this therapy exist. First, t-PA

can aggravate outcomes in hemorrhagic strokes and increase
hemorrhagic transformation in some ischemic strokes (NINDs
t-PA STROKE STUDY GROUP 1997; (Larrue et al., 2001; Hacke
et al., 2004). Second, many patients are ineligible for t-PA
treatment because they arrive in emergency departments after
the FDA-approved therapeutic window of 3 h, although there
remains hope for extending this window (Edlow et al., 2013).
Finally, the delay to recanalization after t-PA treatment is highly
variable and can be rapid, delayed, complete, partial, or absent
(Ribo et al., 2006). Considerable efforts are therefore being
directed toward extending the window for t-PA treatment,
identifying more effective thrombolytic agents, and limiting
the progression of neural injury.
A complementary approach to limiting ischemic injury is
to reinstate metabolic supply prior to clot dissolution. During
ischemic stroke, areas of partial perfusion can maintain
tissue integrity for a few hours and it may be possible to
extend this period by increasing the levels of metabolic
substrates in the residualflow of blood. Hyperoxic ventilation
and/or the administration of compounds that increase the
oxygen carrying capacity of blood continue to be tested in this
regard (Singhal, 2007). An alternative approach is to enhance
the access of metabolic substrates to cells by increasing the
diffusion of small molecules into the ischemic tissue. Transsodium
crocetinate (TSC) is a derivative of the carotenoid
crocetin, and can improve the diffusion of oxygen and
glucose in aqueous solutions (Laidig et al., 1998; Stennett
et al., 2006). Both crocetin and TSC have been shown to
improve tissue oxygenation (Seyde et al., 1986; Okonkwo
et al., 2003) and enhanced tissue oxygenation can occur
without affecting blood flow rates (Holloway and Gainer,
1988). Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that
TSC increases tissue oxygenation in the ischemic penumbra
of a rodent model of focal ischemia (Manabe et al., 2010).
Moreover, TSC treatment improves structural and behavioral
outcomes in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia
(Lapchak, 2010a; Manabe et al., 2010). To be considered as a
potential therapeutic for stroke, a treatment must be effective
when initiated on a delayed basis after the onset of ischemia.
Another desirable feature would be a benign or beneficial
effect on hemorrhagic stroke outcomes, obviating the need
for, and attendant delay associated with, the diagnosis of
ischemic versus hemorrhagic strokes. Consequently, the
current studies examined the impact of delayed TSC treatment
in rat models of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
2. Results
2.1. Focal cerebral ischemia
The effect of TSC was first tested in a model of ischemia–
reperfusion involving 2 h of ischemia (3VO) followed by 22 h
of reperfusion (Fig. 1). Treatment with TSC (n¼7) or saline
(n¼6) was initiated 1½h after the onset of ischemia.
The volume of cerebral infarction was significantly reduced
by 32% in the TSC-treated group (Fig. 1). No differences
in blood gas levels, blood pressure, or rectal temperature
were observed between groups during the surgical procedure.

The effect of TSC was next tested using the 3VO/1VO
model (Fig. 2). Treatment with TSC (n¼6) or saline (n¼6) was
initiated 2 h after the onset of ischemia, i.e. at the cessation
of 3VO, but 4 h prior to the cessation of 1VO. The volume of
cerebral infarction at 24 h was significantly reduced by 33% in
the TSC-treated group (Fig. 2). No differences in blood gas
levels, blood pressure, or rectal temperature were observed
between groups during the surgical procedure.
Another experiment utilizing the 3VO/1VO protocol was
undertaken in which animals were allowed to survive for
three days, in order to assess neurological function. Vehicletreated
and TSC-treated animals were tested using both an
18-point neurological scale and an automated gait analysis
system prior to surgery and on the first and third days postsurgery.
As shown in Fig. 3, TSC-treated animals demonstrated
better outcomes on the neurological scale than
vehicle-treated animals. Similarly, performance on the Cat-
Walk gait analysis task was significantly better in TSC-treated
animals (Fig. 4). No differences in blood gas levels, blood
pressure, or rectal temperature were observed between
groups during the surgical procedure. Body temperature
tested at 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery also did not differ
between vehicle-treated and TSC-treated groups.
2.2. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
A collagenase-injection model of ICH was used to assess the
effect of TSC on hematoma volume, hemispheric swelling,
and hemorrhage volume. A large hematoma was observed in
the collagenase-injected hemispheres of both vehicle-treated
and TSC-treated animals (Fig. 5). Hematoma volume did not
differ significantly between the vehicle-treated group and
TSC-treated group when treatment was initiated 3 h after
collagenase injection, although there was a trend toward
smaller hematoma size in the TSC-treated group (Fig. 5).
Hemispheric swelling was observed in the injected hemispheres
of both groups, but the amount of swelling was
significantly smaller in the TSC-treated group (Fig. 5). Hemorrhage
volume, as estimated by the tissue hemoglobin content
in the injected hemisphere, was also reduced significantly in
the TSC-treated group (Fig. 5).
3. Discussion
The supply of metabolic substrates to the brain is precisely
regulated in order to serve the high metabolic demand of
neurons. Key factors regulating this supply include the rate of
blood flow, composition of the blood/plasma, and the ability
to deliver metabolic substrates from the blood to the brain
cells. The last of these factors is often overlooked because it is
generally treated as a fixed component of the supply chain.
However, it is important to recognize that the transfer of
small molecules from blood to tissue involves a series of
resistances that are mutable. A key limiting resistance in this
series is diffusion through the plasma boundary layer (Huxley
and Kutchai, 1981, 1983; Yamaguchi et al., 1985). Consistent
with Fick's laws of diffusion, oxygen delivery is directly
proportional to both the concentration gradient between
blood and tissue, and diffusivity, which is a measure of the

ease with which a molecule diffuses through a medium. It is
therefore possible to enhance substrate delivery to tissue not
only by increasing the concentration of a metabolic substrate
in the blood (e.g. blood hyperoxia), but also by enhancing the
diffusion of substrates by modifying diffusivity.
An enhancement of metabolic substrate diffusion is postulated
to be the primary mechanism by which TSC mitigates
ischemic brain injury (Seyde et al., 1986; Manabe et al., 2010).
In areas of partial tissue perfusion, such as an ischemic
penumbra, neurons that are located more distant from their
nearest microvessel experience more severe consequences
than neurons located closer to a microvessel (Mabuchi et al.,
2005). The difference in distances between the severelyaffected
neurons and the healthier neurons is on the order
of 5–10μm, which raises the possibility that modifying diffusion
could increase the availability of metabolic substrates to
at-risk cells. TSC increases the diffusion rates of oxygen and
glucose through aqueous media (Laidig et al., 1998; Stennett
et al., 2006). Although baseline diffusivities for oxygen and
glucose in aqueous media differ, TSC increases both by a
similar percentage (30–35%) (Stennett et al., 2006). Thus, TSC
does not selectively affect oxygen or glucose. Rather, TSC
increases hydrogen bonding of neighboring water molecules,
resulting in a condition known as “structure-building”, which
reduces the resistance to the diffusion of small molecules.
Recent studies have demonstrated that TSC can increase
oxygen levels in normal brain and in brain tumors (Okonkwo
et al., 2003; Sheehan et al., 2009). Moreover, TSC was shown to
reduce the depth of hypoxia in the ischemic penumbra of a
3VO model by approximately 55% (Manabe et al., 2010). This
effective blunting of an ischemic challenge has been termed
“metabolic reflow” to underscore the concept that TSC
improves metabolic supply to tissue under conditions of
ongoing partial perfusion (Manabe et al., 2011). Thus, metabolic
reflow does not target vascular reperfusion or specific
cellular injury cascades, but rather reduces the overall metabolic
impact of an ischemic challenge. Inasmuch as the extent
of ischemic injury is related to the depth of an ischemic event,
improved tissue oxygenation would reasonably be expected to
slow or limit the progression of most, if not all, ischemiainduced
injury cascades.
The current findings demonstrate that structural and functional
injury produced by focal ischemia is reduced when TSC is
administered on a delayed basis after the onset of ischemia. In
addition, the findings provide the first evidence of improved
outcomes in a model of hemorrhagic stroke after TSC treatment.
Together, thesefindings suggest that TSC is an attractive
candidate therapy for treating stroke, irrespective of whether
the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic in nature. However,
when considering the potential translatability of any candidate
therapy for stroke, it is essential to review critically all studies
that have tested the therapeutic. To date, three studies have
evaluated the impact of TSC in animal models of stroke:
Lapchak (2010a), Manabe et al. (2010), and Wang and associates
(current study). The study by Lapchak (2010a) tested TSC in a
rabbit small clot embolic (RSCE) stroke model. The RSCE model
entails the injection of small blood clots into the internal
carotid artery and the assessment of behavioral outcomes using
a clinical rating score (Lapchak, 2010b, 2012). In a dose-ranging
experiment, a single bolus injection of TSC was delivered 5 min
post-embolization via the ear vein at dosages ranging from 0.03
to 0.50 mg/kg. Behavioral outcomes improved significantly at
dosages of 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg, with testing performed at 1 day
post-embolization. An optimally-effective dosage of 0.25 mg/kg
was identified and used for subsequent experiments. Delayed
administration of TSC, either alone or in combination with t-PA,
also improved behavioral outcomes in this model. As a monotherapy
, TSC was effective when administered at 1 h, but not at
3 h post-embolization. When administered in combination
with t-PA, TSC was protective at delays of 1 and 3 h postembolization.
Importantly, TSC was effective when administered
contemporaneously with t-PA at 3 h post-embolization.
These findings suggest that TSC can be effective both prior to t-
PA-induced recanalization and during the period of t-PA-
induced recanalization. A key strength of this study is the use
of neurological outcomes in a well-documented and clinicallyrelevant
model for ischemic stroke.
The study by Manabe et al. (2010) tested TSC in a rat 3VO
model, using both permanent and temporary occlusion protocols.
A dose-ranging experiment was performed with the
permanent 3VO model using 8 dosages of TSC, ranging from
0.023 to 4.58 mg/kg. TSC was administered via the femoral
vein beginning 10 min after the onset of ischemia using a
bolus–infusion–bolus protocol. The primary outcome used for
this study was infarct volume measured 24 h after the
onset of ischemia. TSC significantly reduced infarct volume
at dosages ranging from 0.023 to 0.229 mg/kg. Although
dosages at or above 0.458 mg/kg did not significantly reduce
infarct volume, the drug was well tolerated by the animals
up to the highest dosage tested (4.58 mg/kg). Based on the
Fig. 3 – TSC improves post-ischemic performance on an
18-point neurological assessment scale. No significant
differences were observed between groups prior to surgery.
Significant impairments were observed on both postoperative
days in the vehicle and TSC groups, as compared
with: (a) the pre-operative baseline within a group, and (b)
the Sham group at the matched post-surgical time point.
TSC treatment improved performance significantly at both
post-operative time points, as compared with the vehicle
group. P-values of less than 0.01 were obtained for all of
these comparisons. Values shown are means and SEMs;

dose-response data, an optimally-effective dosage of
0.092 mg/kg was identified, and this dosage reduced infarct
volume by approximately 60%. The effect of 0.092 mg/kg TSC
was also tested using a temporary 3VO model. When TSC was
administered 10 min after the onset of a 2-hour period of
ischemia, infarct volume was significantly reduced by 45%. A
key weakness of the Manabe et al. study with respect to its
applicability for stroke is that TSC was administered 10 min
after the onset of ischemia in both the permanent and
temporary 3VO protocols. Clearly, this is too brief of a delay
to be relevant for the clinical treatment of stroke. Nonetheless
, this treatment protocol is quite relevant for other
applications in which brain ischemia can be anticipated, such
as certain neurosurgical procedures, or for conditions in
which ischemia is a chronic challenge. An important strength
of this study is that the postulated mechanism of TSC action
was directly examined, and TSC was shown to increase tissue
oxygenation during ongoing ischemia in the penumbra of the
temporary 3VO model. This demonstrated that the postulated
mechanism of TSC action responsible for protection, i.e.
modified supply of a metabolic substrate, is indeed affected.
The current study tested TSC using rat models of temporary
focal ischemia and intracerebral hemorrhage. The first
temporary focal ischemia experiment utilized a 2-hour period
of 3VO with TSC administration initiated 1.5 h after the onset
of ischemia using a bolus–infusion–bolus protocol. TSC
reduced significantly infarct volume by 32%. The second
temporary focal ischemia experiment employed a 2-hour
period of 3VO, followed by an additional 4 h period of one
vessel (middle cerebral artery) occlusion. In this 3VO/1VO
model, TSC treatment was initiated 2 h after the onset of
ischemia using a bolus–infusion–bolus protocol. TSC significantly
reduced infarct volume by 34% and significantly
improved behavioral outcomes as assessed by both a neurological
scale and an automated gait analysis system at 1 and 3
days post-ischemia. It is therefore notable that TSC treatment
was effective in this experiment even when complete reflow
was not established until 6 h after the onset of ischemia.
The 3VO/1VO protocol warrants specific comment in this
context because it is not a common protocol for preclinical
studies of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Although partial
reperfusion is common after human ischemic stroke and can
persist for many hours, even after the administration of t-PA
(Ribo et al., 2006), this type of ischemic challenge is not
typically evaluated in preclinical stroke studies. The purpose
of the 3VO/1VO model was to mimic partial reperfusion and
then to test the effects of TSC against this type of prolonged
ischemic challenge. The 6-hour period of ischemia in the
Fig. 4 – TSC improves gait function after 3VO/1VO ischemia, as assessed by the CatWalk system. Multiple gait function
parameters were impaired by the 3VO/1VO challenge, including Step Sequence Regularity Index, Speed, Cadence, Swing
Speed, Stand and Stride Length in all four paws, Base of Support, Support, Phase Dispersions, and Max Intensity. Notably,
post-ischemic performance by the 3VO/1VOþTSC Group was significantly better than that of the 3VO/1VOþSaline Group on
several measures. Outcomes of statistical comparisons are shown below. Abbreviations: L¼left, R¼right, F¼front, H¼hind.

3VO/1VO protocol is a relatively long challenge, as compared
with most standard animal models of ischemia–reperfusion.
In fact, a comparison of the infarct sizes produced in the
Vehicle groups of the 3VO-only and 3VO/1VO protocols
(Figs. 1 and 2) demonstrates that the added period of partial
ischemia in the 3VO/1VO protocol produces more extensive
damage to the supply field of the middle cerebral artery than
does the 3VO-only protocol. Importantly, despite the added
ischemic challenge of the 3VO/1VO protocol, TSC was capable
of reducing both structural and functional injury.
The final experiment in the current study examined the
effects of TSC in a model of ICH in which the drug was
administered at a dosage of 0.092 mg/kg beginning 3 h after
collagenase injection using a bolus–infusion–bolus protocol.
Hemispheric swelling and hemorrhage volume were reduced
significantly by TSC treatment; hematoma volume was
reduced slightly, but not significantly. It is unclear whether
the dosage of TSC utilized in this experiment produces a
maximal protective effect. Selection of the TSC dosage used
for this experiment was based on optimal outcomes obtained
in a previous dose-response study of focal ischemia (Manabe
et al., 2010). The rationale for this approach was to determine
whether an effective dosage for mitigating ischemic injury
might also impact post-hemorrhagic outcomes. If post-ICH
outcomes were aggravated under these conditions, then the
use of TSC for the emergent treatment of a stroke, i.e. prior to
diagnosis of ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke, would be
contraindicated. However, the TSC dosage utilized actually
improved post-ICH outcomes, suggesting that TSC could be
beneficial for early treatment of stroke, regardless of the type
of stroke. Nonetheless, it will be important for future studies
to define the dose-response relation for TSC and hemorrhagic
injury. Moreover, it will be valuable to test multiple models of
ICH, as each experimental model possesses its own strengths
and weaknesses for mimicking ICH. Another important goal
will be to test the effects of TSC on long-term neurological
outcomes after ICH. Extending the survival of animals to
weeks to months would provide additional insights into the
permanence of the protective effects of TSC. Despite the need
for additional future studies, it is important to note the
current findings provide the first evidence that TSC does
not aggravate injury in a model of hemorrhagic stroke, but
actually improves certain outcomes.
Taken together, the findings from these three studies
portray TSC as a promising therapeutic candidate for treating
acute ischemic stroke. TSC improved behavioral and structural
outcomes using multiple, challenging animal models of
stroke. The drug was evaluated in two different species and
in two different laboratories. In one of the studies, TSC was
shown to be effective when administered in combination
with t-PA, the standard therapeutic for human ischemic
stroke. The postulated mechanism of action underpinning
ischemic protection, i.e. enhanced metabolic supply, was
demonstrated. The dose-efficacy findings were similar for
the RSCE model and the 3VO model. While these are promising
results, a few key issues remain to be addressed. Perhaps
the most important of these issues concerns the persistence
of neurological protection provided by TSC for the treatment
for acute ischemic stroke. The two studies examining behavioral
outcomes evaluated very brief follow-up periods. It will
be important for future studies to extend these observations
to a period of weeks to months. The therapeutic window of
Fig. 5 – TSC improved outcomes after ICH. Photographs show examples of serial sections from a vehicle-treated and a TSC-
treated animal. Hematomas appear dark-red in these unstained, thick sections. Hematoma volume was reduced slightly in
the TSC group; however, this difference did not achieve statistical significance (n¼6 for each group). Treatment with TSC
reduced significantly hemispheric swelling by 46% and hemorrhage volume by 20% (**po0.05, Student's t-test; n¼6 for each
group). Values are means and SEMs.

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
opportunity also remains to be defined. Successful protection
has been shown after delays to treatment of 2–3h.  It  is
conceivable that this window is wider, and this could be
evaluated by testing longer delays to treatment. Additionally,
the validity of TSC as a therapeutic candidate would be
greatly substantiated by successful testing in a primate
model of acute ischemic stroke.
Novel therapies can also raise the specter of novel undesirable
side-effects. In the case of TSC, a key concern was the
possibility of a magnified oxidative burst and free radical
damage during the reflow phase following ischemia. It is
possible that the enhancement of tissue oxygenation by TSC
during ischemia (Manabe et al., 2010) could amplify the
deleterious effects of reperfusion injury. However, this is
not the case. Using direct measurements of tissue oxygenation
in the ischemic penumbra of the rat 3VO model,
hyperoxia that occurs upon reperfusion was actually reduced
by TSC (Manabe et al., 2010). The mechanistic basis for the
attenuation of reperfusion hyperoxia is unknown, but may
simply reflect the fact that the tissue is healthier in the TSC-
treated animals.
Another issue associated with the development of any
drug-based therapy is the possibility that multiple protective
mechanisms contribute to the improved outcomes. This is a
possibility that is difficult to rule out entirely. Even though the
postulated mechanism of action (i.e. increased tissue oxygenation
) has been directly demonstrated (Manabe et al., 2010),
carotenoid molecules possess anti-oxidant activity, which
could conceivably contribute to the protective actions of TSC.
However, although TSC can serve as an anti-oxidant, this
effect occurs at dosages much higher than those needed to
produce an effect on diffusivity (Stennett et al., 2007). In
addition, the dose-response curve for the protective effect of
TSC on ischemic damage is U-shaped (Manabe et al., 2010).
Thus, the capability of TSC to limit cerebral infarction actually
diminishes as the effective dosage range is achieved for
exerting anti-oxidative effects in the tissue. This does not
eliminate other possible mechanisms of action, and it will be
important for future studies to consider whether influences in
addition to increased tissue oxygenation contribute to the
protective effects of TSC. It should also be noted that, although
there is a U-shaped dose-response curve for the protective
actions of TSC, higher dosages do not appear to have an
attendant increase in risk or side effects (Manabe et al., 2010),
as is the case for many therapeutics, including t-PA.
Based on these encouraging results from preclinical models, it
is reasonable to consider the feasibility of developing metabolic
reflow into a clinical therapy for stroke. For instance, if clot–lysis
therapy is available, then why would metabolic reflow therapy
be of additional value? Several lines of reasoning support the
potential clinical importance of metabolic reflow. First, clot–lysis
therapy can take time to be effective. In fact, the rate of clot-lysis
is a key factor dictating the therapeutic window for t-PA
treatment. In this scenario, metabolic reflow could bridge the
gap between the onset of t-PA treatment and clot dissolution.
Second, clot–lysis therapy often results in only partial or minimal
recanalization. As shown here, TSC treatment can limit tissue
damage and improve behavioral outcomes even when vascular
perfusion is not fully re-established in a timely manner. In this
setting, TSC might be able to extend the therapeutic window for
the clot–lysis therapy. Third, it is plausible that metabolic reflow
therapy can be safely implemented prior to diagnosis of the type
of stroke that is under way. Unlike clot–lysis therapy, which
increases the risk of re-bleeding and hemorrhagic transformation
, metabolic reflow therapy does not appear to impart additional
risk. In fact, our current findings indicate that it might
actually be beneficial for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.
Fourth, bloodflow may not be fully re-established in an ischemic
penumbra, even after complete reflow of a large occluded vessel
is established. In this scenario, a prolonged partial ischemia may
persist in the downstream penumbra even after the dissolution
of a clot upstream. Such a condition could also benefit from 
metabolic reflow therapy.
A final consideration is whether TSC can be safely used in
the human population. TSC has already been evaluated in two
Phase I/II clinical trials. The first trial evaluated safety and
exercise performance in patients with peripheral artery disease
(PAD) (Mohler et al., 2011). Patients were randomized to
placebo or TSC groups, and 8 dosing levels ranging from 0.25 to
2.0 mg/kg were administered intravenously each day for a
period of 5 days. No dose-response effect for TSC was observed
for serious adverse events for any organ system. The interpretation
of the overall safety outcomes in the trial was that
TSC appears to be a safe treatment and the data support the
further development of extended dosing schemes (Mohler
et al., 2011). The development of extended dosing will ultimately
be important for conditions of chronic ischemia, such
as PAD. While the use of a prolonged treatment regimen may
be less relevant to acute ischemic stroke therapy, it might
prove of value for other applications such as repetitive
transient ischemic attacks. Notably, TSC showed promise in
improving walking performance in the PAD patients, supporting
the value of undertaking a more comprehensive Phase II
trial. The second clinical trial involving TSC (CLINICAL TRIAL
IDENTIFIER: NCT01465347) is ongoing and is evaluating the
safety and efficacy of TSC as an adjunct for radiotherapy (RT)
in treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The rationale for
this trial is that glioma cells in hypoxic zones of the tumors are
quite radioresistant, rendering the GBM refractory to RT.
Elevating intra-tumor oxygen could reestablish radiosensitivity
in glioma cells, thus making the tumors less resistant to RT.
Sheehan and associates have provided evidence that TSC can
increase intratumor tissue oxygenation and enhance the
effects of RT in a rat syngeneic model of GBM (Sheehan
et al., 2008, 2009, 2010). The Phase I/II clinical trial testing this
strategy is currently in progress with an initial enrollment of
60 patients at 18 sites. This trial also involves multiple
intravenous injections of TSC, timed to correspond with a
fractionated RT protocol. No primary outcomes are as yet
available from the trial. However, the drug administration
stage of the trial has been completed, and the initial safety
outcomes indicated that no severe adverse effects observed in
the patients were attributable to an effect of TSC. Together, the
findings of these two clinical trials portray TSC as a safe drug
for use in humans, which further strengthens the potential
translatability of the drug for use in stroke.
In summary, the development of optimal thrombolytics,
neuroprotective compounds, and devices remains a key goal
for translational stroke research. Metabolic reflow using
TSC could be highly complementary to these approaches.

This strategy might extend the therapeutic windows for
thrombolysis and neuroprotection by improving the general
health of ischemic tissue during an ongoing ischemic event.
In addition, TSC may be suitable for early intervention
irrespective of whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic
in nature. This novel therapy might thus serve as a bridge to
keep ischemic tissue healthy long enough for other primary
therapies to be effective.
4. Experimental procedure
4.1. Focal cerebral ischemia
All animal procedures were approved by the University of
Virginia's Animal Care and Use Committee. In all studies,
animals were randomized to groups and the investigators
performing outcome analyses were blinded to the group
identity of the animals. Focal cerebral ischemia is produced
by a three-vessel occlusion (3VO) surgery blocking one middle
cerebral artery (MCA) and both common carotid arteries
(CCAs) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. This technique
has been described previously in detail (Hiramatsu et al.,
1993). Two variants of this technique were used. The first
protocol examined the effects of TSC administered beginning
1½h after the onset of a 2-hour period of 3VO. This protocol
was used to mimic treatment given prior to complete reflow
during an ischemic stroke. Animals were treated with vehicle
(saline) (n¼6) or TSC (n¼7). The second 3VO protocol entailed
3VO for 2 h followed by continued clipping of the MCA for an
additional 4 h. This protocol, termed 3VO/1VO, was used to
mimic partial reflow followed by delayed complete reflow.
Animals were treated with vehicle (saline) (n¼6) or TSC
(n¼6). Both of these reflow scenarios mimic events observed
in the human stroke population (Ribo et al., 2006).
TSC (Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Charlottesville, VA) or
vehicle (saline) was administered via the femoral vein beginning
at 1½h after the onset of ischemia in the 3VO experiment
and at 2 h after the onset of ischemia in the 3VO/1VO
experiment. Vehicle or TSC was administered using a “bolus–
infusion–bolus” protocol (Okonkwo et al., 2003; Manabe et al.,
2010). The total dosage of TSC administered was 0.092 mg/kg,
which was selected based on a dose-response assessment of
the protective actions of TSC (Manabe et al., 2010). Blood gas
levels, blood pressure, and rectal temperature were monitored
during surgery.
Animals were euthanized 24 h after the onset of ischemia
and coronal sections of the brain were stained with 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to visualize areas of
cerebral infarction. Infarct volume, corrected for swelling,
was calculated for each animal. Statistical comparisons
between vehicle-treated and TSC-treated groups utilized
Student's t-test, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was accepted
as statistically significant.
An additional experiment utilizing the 3VO/1VO protocol
assessed neurological outcomes in vehicle-treated (n¼6), TSC-
treated (n¼6), and Sham-operated (n¼6) groups. Animals were
tested before surgery and on days 1 and 3 after surgery. An 18-
point neurological assessment scale, which is a standard metric
for assessing deficits after MCAO, was used (Garcia et al., 1995).
In addition, an automated gait analysis system (CatWalk,
Noldus), which measures numerous parameters of gait, was
utilized. Previous studies using CatWalk (Wang et al., 2008;
Encarnacion et al., 2011) have identi fied multiple MCAO-
sensitive gait parameters.
4.2. Intracerebral hemorrhage
A rat model of ICH involving the injection of collagenase into
the brain (Rosenberg et al., 1990;Elger et al., 1994) was used to
examine the effect of TSC on hemorrhagic injury. Adult male
Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with Isoflurane and
ventilated with Isoflurane using an FiO
2
of 50%. Blood
pressure was monitored and blood gases were sampled via
the tail artery. Five microliters of collagenase (0.05 U bacteria
collagenase; type IV, Sigma Chemical Co.) were injected
stereotactically into the caudate putamen over 5 min. Three
hours after collagenase injection, TSC (0.092 mg/kg) or saline
was administered via the femoral vein. Blood pressure was
controlled by adjusting Isoflurane levels to maintain the
mean arterial pressure at 100–110 mm Hg. Body temperature
was monitored with a rectal thermometer and maintained at
37 1C using a heating pad.
Three outcomes were assessed for the ICH model: hematoma
volume, brain edema, and brain hemoglobin levels.
Hematoma volume and brain edema were measured in thick
(2 mm) brain sections of TSC-treated (n¼6) and vehicletreated
animals (n¼6) that were euthanized 48 h after collagenase
infusion. Brain hemoglobin levels were measured in
a separate group of animals utilizing a spectrophotometric
assay in order to estimate the amount of intracerebral
bleeding (n¼6 for each group) (Choudhri et al., 1997). Animals
were euthanized 48 h after collagenase infusion and whole
brain was assayed.
