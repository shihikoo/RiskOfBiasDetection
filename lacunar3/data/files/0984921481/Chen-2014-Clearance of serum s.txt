Abstract
Background: We have previously reported that hemofiltration (HF) may be an effective additional means of
treating heat stroke when rapid cooling is not effective.
Methods: Dogs were assigned to a heat stroke (control) or heat stroke + hemofiltration (HF) group (n = 8 each
group). After heat stroke induction, dogs in the HF group received HF for 3 h. Serum concentrations of interleukin
(IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were measured at baseline and
1, 2, and 3 h after heat stroke. Clearance rates of solutes were determined 1, 2, and 3 h after the start of HF.
Results: Serum concentrations of all solutes tended to increase with time after heat stroke in the control group,
but decreased (BUN, creatinine) or remained relatively unchanged (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10) with time in the HF group.
Concentrations of all solutes were significantly lower in the HF group compared with the control group at 2 and
3h( P< 0.05). Clearance rates for small molecular weight solutes were high, while those for larger molecular weight
solutes were low.
Conclusion: HF prevents heat stroke-induced increases in serum cytokine concentrations and is effective for clearing
small molecular weight solutes from serum, but less effective for clearing larger molecular weight solutes, including
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10.

Background
Heat stroke is a common condition indicated by an increased
core body temperature (>40°C), central nervous
system dysfunction, and often also cardiovascular dysfunction
[1,2]. Inflammatory and immunologic changes
are also common [3,4]. Of note, estimates suggest that
there are approximately 600 heat-related deaths per year
in the United States [5]. Furthermore, heat illness among
high school athletes in the United States is the most
common cause of morbidity and mortality [6]. The onset
of heat stroke can be abrupt, and may result in multiple
organ damage with consequent long term dysfunction or
death [1,7]. Prompt treatment is therefore essential to
ameliorate hyperthermia and the risk of long term disability
or death. The current standard of care for heat
stroke is reducing core temperature by active cooling
through cold water immersion [2,8]. Unfortunately, such
treatment is ineffective in approximately one-third of patients
[9,10]. As a consequence, we and others have been
investigating additional methods for the treatment of
heat stroke.
In a previous study, we reported that continuous hemofiltration
(HF), a technique often used in the treatment of
critically ill patients with acute renal failure in intensive
care settings [11,12], helped to rapidly reduce core body
temperature, stabilize hemodynamics, improve homeostasis
, and increase survival in dogs with severe heat stroke
[13]. Zhou et al. have also recently reported that HF was

effective for lowering core body temperature, removing
myoglobin, improving organ function, and modulating
acid–base balance and the systemic inflammatory response
in 16 patients with heat stroke [14]. The precise
mechanisms through which HF exerts these beneficial effects
in heat stroke are unclear.
Because heat stroke is associated with a systemic inflammatory
response [1], we hypothesized that the previously
observed beneficial effects of HF in heat stroke
[13] may at least in part be due to the removal of solutes
from blood, especially inflammatory mediators. Indeed,
various other studies have demonstrated that HF has
beneficial effects that are presumably mediated by modulation
of plasma/serum concentrations of inflammatory
and anti-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-
10 (IL-10) in animal models of endotoxin-induced lung
injury [15], severe acute pancreatitis [16], and septic shock
[17], and in clinical studies of patients with systemic inflammatory
response syndrome/multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome [18]. Therefore, in the present study, we
investigated changes in serum concentrations and clearance
of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 and
the anti-inflammatory factor, IL-10, in dogs following the
induction of heat stroke and HF. We also examined
changes and clearance of two smaller molecular weight
solutes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.
Methods
Animals
Healthy male dogs (n = 16: purchased from the Department
of Comparative Medicine, Fuzhou General Hospital of
Nanjing Military Region) weighing 11–17 kg were
housed in a temperature (24.7 ± 1.3°C) and humidity
(49.9 ± 6.5%) controlled environment. Animals were
randomly assigned to a control (heat stroke only) or
HF (heat stroke + HF) group (n = 8 per group). The
sample size used was selected with reference to previous
studies [19-21], in which 6–8 animals were used 
per group. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing
Military Command.
Anaesthesia
Animals were food-deprived for 6 h and then intramuscularly
injected with ketamine hydrochloride (40 mg/kg)
and atropine (0.05 mg/kg). During the study, anesthesia
was maintained with low dose ketamine hydrochloride.
After the induction of anesthesia, rectal lavage was performed
with 200 mL of normal saline to remove residual
faeces. A rectal probe (Philips Technology Co., Ltd,
Beijing, China) was then inserted 10 cm toward the rectum
for continuous monitoring of rectal temperature as
the indicator of core temperature.
Catheterization
After the induction of anesthesia, the skin above the
femoral artery/vein was sterilized and an incision was
made. The femoral artery and vein were exposed, and an
8-Fr double-lumen central catheter inserted in each. The
arterial catheter was used for monitoring of arterial pressure
and blood gases (Invasive Continuous Arterial Blood
Pressure Monitor, Philips Technology Co., Ltd), and the
venous catheter was used for HF and for collection of
blood samples.
Induction of heat stroke
Severe heat stroke was induced by exposing animals to a
high temperature as previously described [13,22]. Briefly,
two dogs at a time (one from each group) were placed
in a high temperature climate cabin (Nanfang Medical
University, Guangdong, China) with a temperature of
36 ± 0.5°C and a humidity of 70% to simulate a megathermal
climate. Severe heat stroke was indicated by a rectal
temperature > 42°C and a transient decrease in mean arterial
pressure > 25 mmHg. Upon induction of heat stroke,
dogs were removed from the chamber, and those in the
control group observed at room temperature, and those in
the HF group subjected to HF.
Hemofiltration
HF was carried out using a hollow fiber hemofilter with
a polysulfone membrane (membrane area = 1.4 m2 with
cut off value of 30 kDa; Fresenius, Oberursel, Germany).
The circulation tube was first flushed with normal saline
containing 25 IU/mL heparin for 30 min in order to
heparinize the tube. Tube and filter were then flushed
with 200 mL pre-collected blood (200 mL) in order to
prevent anemia due to dilution. Next, the central catheters
in the femoral artery and vein were connected to
the arterial and venous ends of the machine, and hemofiltration
was initiated. No ultrafiltration was done, so
volume expansion did not occur. The only fluid added
was only replacement of the fluid in the filtrate. Heparin
(1250 IU/kg) was given via the femoral artery 1 min before
HF, and maintenance heparin (625 IU/kg/h) was
given during HF via a micro bolus pump. HF was performed
for 3 h at a blood flow rate of 70 ml/min and a
fluid replacement rate of 200 ml/kg/h. The replacement
fluid contained 138.28 mmol/L Na, 106.58 mmol/L Cl,
35.72 mmol/L bicarbonate, 2.71 mmol/L Ca, 1.52 mmol/
L Mg, 9.26 mmol/L glucose, and 4.02 mmol/L K. The
temperature of the replacement fluid was 24.69 ± 1.28°C.
Outcome measurements
Peripheral blood counts (white blood cells [WBC], neutrophils
, leukocytes, red blood cells, and platelets) were
the primary outcome measure and were determined before
the induction of heat stroke (baseline), when heat

stroke was first detected (0 h), and 1, 2, and 3 h after
heat stroke.
Serum concentrations of 5 solutes, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6,
BUN, and creatinine, were also measured before the induction
of heat stroke (baseline), when heat stroke was
first detected (0 h), and 1, 2, and 3 h after heat stroke.
Concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured
using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kits (Beijing Meidike Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Beijing, China). Concentrations of BUN and creatinine
were measured using an Olympus AU2700 automatic biochemical
analyzer (Olympus Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
In the HF group, 2 mL of filtrate were collected at 1, 2,
and 3 h, and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 30 min. Ultrafiltrate
concentrations of IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, BUN, and
creatinine were measured as already described.
Clearance rates for IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, BUN, and creatinine
were determined 1, 2, and 3 h after the start of HF
[19]. Clearance rates were calculated as follow: Clearance =
(E/P) × QE, where E and P are the concentrations of specific
solutes in filtrate and serum, and QE is the liquid volume
at the outflow end (=QD + QUF). QD refers to the
amount of fluid displacement due to hemofiltration and
QUF refers to the ultrafiltration-overflow volume. For this
study no ultrafiltration was done, unlike the clinical studies
that combine hemofiltration and ultrafiltation. Therefore
, QUF was 0; and hence QE was equal to QD.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented by mean ± standard deviation and
were compared by analysis of variance with Bonferroni
correction for post-hoc comparisons. Data were analyzed
using SPSS 15.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL). The significance level was set at P < 0.05 for comparing
the difference between control and HF groups at a
given time point. An adjusted significance level of P <
0.01 (0.05/5) was used when comparing peripheral blood
findings (Table 1) and solute concentrations (Table 2).
And an adjusted significance level of P < 0.0167 (0.05/3)
was used for comparing the change in concentration of
solutes (Figure 1) and clearance rate for solutes after
ultrafiltration (Figure 2). We could not use Cox regression
model analysis for the data because we only measured
outcomes at three time points after HF began, and
therefore it was too hard to define the event and timeto-event
parameters necessary for multiple outcome
analysis.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Mean body weight was similar in the control and HF
groups (14.03 ± 1.99 kg vs.14.09 ± 1.633 kg, P= 0.935).
And consistent with our previous report [13], there were
no between-group differences in other baseline characteristics
, including body weight, temperature of the climate
chamber, time to heat stroke, rectal temperature,
ambient temperature, and ambient humidity (data not
shown).
Peripheral blood counts
Changes in peripheral blood counts for both groups are
summarized in Table 1. The WBC count at 3 h was significantly
lower in the HF group compared with the control
group (P= 0.018). There were no other significant
within or between-group differences in the peripheral
blood count findings. The % neutrophil count was decreased
and the % leukocyte and the platelet count increased
in the HF group compared to the control group
at all times during the HF, but none of these differences
reached statistical significance.

Serum solute concentrations
Changes in serum solute concentrations for both groups
are summarized in Table 2. Heat stroke itself markedly
increased the concentrations of all solutes. TNF-α, IL-10,
BUN, and creatinine concentrationsat1,2,and3hwere
significantly lower in the HF group compared with the control
group. IL-6 concentrations at 2 and 3 h were significantly
lower in the HF group compared with the control
group, but at 1 h, IL6 concentrations showed only a trend
to be lower in the HF group. When heat stroke was left
untreated (control group), solute concentrations rose with
time, and TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations were significantly
higher at 1, 2, and 3 h, IL-6 and creatinine concentrations
were significantly higher at 2 and 3 h, and BUN
concentrations were significantly higher at 3 h compared to
0 h. In the HF group, BUN concentrations were significantly
lower at 1, 2, and 3 h, and creatinine concentrations
significantly lower at 2 and 3 h compared with at 0 h. And
in the control group, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations were
significantly higher at 2 and 3 h compared to 1 h.

Solute ultrafiltrate concentrations
The changes in solute ultrafiltrate concentrations (HF group
only) are summarized in Figure 1. Except for IL-10, which
was not detectable at any time point, concentrations of all
solutes decreased with time after the start of HF. IL-6,
BUN, and creatinine concentrations in ultrafiltrate were
significantly lower at 3 h compared to 1 h (P<0.001,P=
0.005, P= 0.015, respectively). IL-6 concentrations were
also significantly lower at 2 h compared to 1 h (P=0.008).
There was no significant difference between any time
points in TNF-α concentrations.
Solute clearance rates
The changes in solute clearance rates (HF group only)
are summarized in Figure 2. Clearance rates for small
molecular weight solutes (BUN, creatinine) were higher
than those for larger molecular weight solutes (TNF-α,
IL-6). Clearance rates for IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly
lower at 2 and 3 h compared to 1 h (2 h, P=
0.001 and 0.005 respectively; 3 h, both P< 0.001). There
were no significant changes in the clearance rates for
BUN or creatinine.
Discussion
In this study, we examined serum concentrations and
clearance of low and high molecular weight solutes (including
cytokines) in dogs that received HF after the induction
of heat stroke. Of note, during the 1 to 3 hour
post-heat stroke induction period, serum concentrations of
TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, BUN, and creatinine were significantly
lower in dogs that received HF than in dogs that did
not receive HF. Clearance rates were relatively high
for the low molecular weight solutes BUN and creatinine
, but relatively low for the high molecular weight solutes
TNF-α and IL-6. These findings suggest that (a) the
previously observed biochemical beneficial effects of HF
[13] may at least in part be due to the prevention of 
increases in serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and
IL-10, and (b) that clearance of solutes by HF after heat
stroke is dependent on molecular weight.
Hemofiltraion significantly decreased WBC compared to
that seen in animals with no hemofiltration. Others have
also reported hemofiltration to reduce WBC [23,24]. It has
been suggested that contact with the hemofilter causes
leucocyte activation, an increase in leucocyte-platelet interaction
and hemofilter clotting, and consequent decrease
in WBC [25]. However, Skogby et al. [26] comparing fresh,
heparinized blood perfused through an extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation system for 24 h with or without
addition of a hemofilter reported that addition of a hemofilter
sis not significantly affect WBC or platelet count.
We found that in the 3 hours after the induction of
heat stroke, serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10,
BUN, and creatinine continued to increase in the control
group of dogs, but not in the group of dogs that subsequently
received HF. Similarly, WBC counts increased in
the control group after the induction of heat stroke, but
had returned close to baseline after 3 h in the HF group.
The increased cytokine concentrations and WBC counts
observed in the control group are consistent with the

systemic inflammatory response known to occur in heat
stroke [1]. Because inflammation appears to play a role
in mediating the deleterious effects of heat stroke [1,27],
the observed lack of further increase in cytokine concentrations
in dogs that received HF is an important finding.
This finding is also consistent with our previously
reported finding that HF decreases serum concentrations
of endotoxin, a key inflammatory mediator [1], in dogs
with heat stroke [13]. Taken together, our findings suggest
that the HF can ameliorate the systemic inflammatory
response associated with heat stroke.
In the HF group, serum concentrations of BUN and
creatinine decreased with time after the start of HF, whereas
concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 remained relatively
steady. Consistent with these findings, the clearance
rates were higher for BUN and creatinine than for TNF-α,
and IL-6 (note: IL-10 was not detectable in ultrafiltrate
samples). These findings suggest that HF is effective for
clearing low molecular weight solutes, such as BUN and
creatinine, but is less effective for clearing higher molecular
weight solutes, such as cytokines. In general, hemofiltration
has a lower clearance of low molecular weight
molecules than for high molecular weight molecules.
However, increasing the replacement rate in hemofiltration
will increase he clearance of solutes, especially low
molecular weight solutes [28], and the replacement flow
rate used in our study (200 ml/kg.h) is a rate categorized
by others as extremely high volume ultrafilratioon [29]. In
our clinical practice, when extremely high hemofiltration
was performed in patients with acute pancreatitis, similar
findings were observed, that is, the concentration of small
molecules such as urea and creatinine was reduced significantly.
The low clearance rates for cytokines can be
attributed to the molecular weight filtration capacity of
the filter used (30 kDa). Note: the molecular weights for
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 are 19–28 kDa, 17.5 kDa, and
35–40 kDa, respectively. The lower molecular weights
of TNF-α and IL-6 relative to IL-10 explains why these
cytokines were cleared to some extent, whereas IL-10 was
not cleared at all. A similar study has been reported elsewhere
[30]. Use of a filter with a larger molecular weight
filtration capacity or HF in combination with plasma replacement
and hemoperfusion might help increase the
clearance of larger molecular weight solutes [31,32]. Further
studies are needed to examine this possibility. Expansion
of the blood volume had no role in the hemofiltration
results, because the only fluid given in hemofiltration is
fluid to replace the fluid removed in the filtrate.
Although serum cytokine concentrations did not decrease
with HF, they did not increase after heat stroke as
seen in the control group, and were significantly lower
at these times than corresponding concentrations in
control group dogs. We suggest that the lack of an increase
in serum cytokine concentrations in the HF group
may be at least in part due to the previously demonstrated
early and rapid reduction in body temperature,
improved homeostasis, and the lack of an increase in
serum endotoxin concentrations following HF [13]. Increased
clearance/removal of TNF-α and IL-6 through
HF would also appear to play some role in preventing
further increases in the serum concentrations of these
cytokines. There also may have been some absorption of
cytokines by the filter used for HF. Further studies are
warranted to examine in more detail the relative contributions
of filtration and changes in body temperature in
mediating the potential beneficial effects of HF.
This study has a number of limitations. We did not
measure soluble cytokine receptors and so we do not know
how what role they might have played. We did not include
a control group of normal (non-heat shock, non-HF)
dogs, however the baseline blood factor values obtained
from our dogs provided data on normal values for these
factors. We did not include a control group of dogs that
only received heat stroke, because the clearance of factors
in blood by HF alone has previously been investigated by
numerous animal and clinical studies. We did not include
a group with active cooling because of cost concerns. Also,
our objective was limited to determining the effect of HF
after heat shock vs. heat shock alone. We did not include
a group of animals treated with fluid infusion because
none of the animals in our 2 groups received fluid infusion
except for replacement of fluid lost during HF,
and so fluid infusion was not involved. The total number
of dogs included in each group (n = 8) was relatively
small; hence, confirmatory studies are needed. We did not
perform any assessments of kidney function (ie, urinary
clearance of solutes). Finally, the duration of follow-up
was relatively limited. Further studies are needed to examine
longer term changes in serum solutes after HF, as
well as short and longer term changes in urine solutes
after HF.
Conclusions
In summary, this study has shown that HF prevents increases
in serum cytokine concentrations due to heat
stroke in dogs, and that HF is effective for clearing small
molecular weight serum solutes, but is less effective for
clearing larger molecular weight solutes. Increased clearance
of TNF-α and IL-6 by HF may play some role in
preventing the increase in serum concentrations of these
cytokines; however, the magnitude of clearance was not
large relative to that of the smaller weight solutes. Taken
together with our previously reported findings that
HF rapidly reduces core body temperature, stabilizes
hemodynamics, improves homeostasis, and increases survival
compared to no treatment in dogs with severe heat
stroke [13], these findings further emphasize the beneficial
biochemical effects of HF in the treatment of heat stroke.

Further studies are needed to elucidate the changes underlying
these beneficial biochemical effects more fully and to
optimize the use of HF as a potential treatment for heat
stroke.
