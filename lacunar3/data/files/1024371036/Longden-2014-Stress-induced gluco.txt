Studies of stress effects on the brain have traditionally focused on
neurons, without considering the cerebral microcirculation. Here
we report that stress impairs neurovascular coupling (NVC), the
process that matches neuronal activity with increased local blood
flow. A stressed phenotype was induced in male rats by administering
a 7-d heterotypical stress paradigm. NVC was modeled by
measuring parenchymal arteriole (PA) vasodilation in response to
neuronal stimulation in amygdala brain slices. After stress, vasodilation
of PAs to neuronal stimulation was greatly reduced, and
dilation of isolated PAs to external K+ was diminished, suggesting
a defect in smooth muscle inwardly rectifying K+ (K
IR
)channelfunction.
Consistent with these observations, stress caused a reduction
in PA K
IR
2.1 mRNA and smooth muscle K
IR
current density, and
blocking K
IR
channels significantly inhibited NVC in control, but
not in stressed, slices. Delivery of corticosterone for 7 d (without
stressors) or RU486 (before stressors) mimicked and abrogated NVC
impairment by stress, respectively. We conclude that stress causes
a glucocorticoid-mediated decrease in functional K
IR
channels in
amygdala PA myocytes. This renders arterioles less responsive to
K+ released from astrocytic endfeet during NVC, leading to impairment
of this process. Because the fidelity of NVC is essential for
neuronal health, the impairment characterized here may contribute
to the pathophysiology of brain disorders with a stress component.

Stressor exposure has been linked to detrimental health effects
, and the activation of stress responses is recognized as
a contributory factor in many pathologies. Chronic exposure to
stressors can alter neuronal physiology, and signaling in stressassociated
networks, including those underlying the processing
of fearful and anxiogenic stimuli such as the amygdala, the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the hippocampus,
may become aberrant after chronic stress (1–3). Underlying this
in part are morphological changes at the cellular level (including
changes in dendritic arborization in hippocampal, BNST, and
amygdalar neurons) (4) and altered expression of stress-related
proteins, such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) (5), tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) (6), and polysialylated neural cell
adhesion molecule (7). It has been suggested that such changes
contribute to psychopathologies including depression, anxiety, and
posttraumatic stress disorder (8).
Stress also impacts the cardiovascular system, and a developing
body of literature has linked repeated/chronic stress exposure
to cardiovascular disease. Indeed, high perceived job stress is
associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular
events (9), and psychological distress has been associated with an
increased risk of fatal ischemic stroke (10), for which impaired
cerebrovascular endothelial function resulting from enhanced
glucocorticoid release may be a contributory factor (11). Recent
reports have also explored the acceleratory effects of stress on
the progression of dementia and Alzheimer’s (12–15)—disease
states with an important cerebrovascular component.
Active regions of the brain require rapid and precise delivery
of nutrients through a local elevation of blood flow, a phenomenon
known as functional hyperemia. This moment-to-moment
matching of blood flow to metabolic demand is ensured by the
signaling mechanisms of neurovascular coupling (NVC). Astrocytes
seem to play a central role in NVC by generating a calcium
(Ca2+) wave in response to neuronal activity (16) that propagates
to specialized endfoot projections, which almost completely encase
intracerebral (parenchymal) arterioles (PAs) (17). This increase
in endfoot Ca2+evokes relaxation of juxtaposed arteriolar
smooth muscle (SM) through the release of potassium (K+) ions
and other vasodilators such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)
(18). The elevation of K+ in the perivascular space activates SM
inwardly rectifying K+ (K
IR
) channels to cause PA vasodilation
and increased blood flow (19). Because NVC provides a communicative
bridge between the central nervous and cardiovascular
systems—both of which are susceptible to stressor exposure—
we reasoned that this vitally important process might also be affected
by stress. Indeed, it is possible that prolonged periods of
stressor exposure (e.g., 1 wk of chronic stress) could alter NVC in
stress-affected regions, such as the amygdala, which responds to
and is shaped by stressful events (20).
In this study we provide the first examination of NVC in the
amygdala and explore the mechanistic basis underlying the impairment
of this process by chronic heterotypic stressor exposure.
This NVC impairment may be a contributory factor in pathologies
with a stress component, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic
stress disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. These studies
Significance
When neurons become active, they signal to local arterioles via
intermediate glial cells, called astrocytes, to evoke dilation. This
increases local blood flow and provides the oxygen and glucose
necessary to support ongoing neuronal function. This process is
termed neurovascular coupling. We demonstrate that chronic
stress—which is a contributing factor for many diseases—impairs
neurovascular coupling in the amygdala, a region involved
in stressor processing. Our results further indicate that this
dysfunction is due to the loss of arteriolar inwardly rectifying
potassium (K+) channel function, which makes vessels
less able to respond to vasodilatory K+ ions released by
astrocytes during periods of increased neuronal activity. This
neurovascular coupling impairment may contribute to the pathology
of a range of brain disorders.

Results
Heterotypic Stressor Exposure for 7 d Produces an Anxious Behavioral
Phenotype.During exposure to an established 7-d heterotypic stress
paradigm (21), weight gain was significantly attenuated in stressed
rats compared with control rats (Fig. 1A). One day after the final
stressor, we analyzed behavior using the elevated plus maze, a test
that capitalizes on the tendency of anxious rodents to prefer closed
spaces to open spaces. Stressed rats spent significantly less time
exploring the open arms of the elevated plus maze (Fig. 1 B and
C). To rule out possible influences of changes in locomotion between
groups (e.g., due to increased freezing behavior in stressed
animals), we assessed the percentage of open arm entries relative
to the total number of arm entries for each animal (Fig. 1D).
This analysis indicated that, regardless of overall locomotor
activity, stressed rats preferentially avoided the open arms of
the maze during the 5-min testing period. Taken together,
these data indicate that our stress paradigm produced an
anxious behavioral phenotype.
Stress Impairs NVC in the Amygdala. The morphology, neurochemistry
, and neurophysiology of neurons in subregions of the amygdala
are altered by chronic stress exposure in ways consistent with
increased activation, and some of the behavioral consequences of
chronic stress are thought to be mediated by these changes (2, 4).
Because stress may lead to sustained activation of some amygdala
subregions [e.g., lateral (2) and basolateral (22) nuclei], we hypothesized
that stress might also affect arteriolar function and
NVC in the amygdala. We thus chose to focus our studies on
arterioles serving the amygdala, including the lateral, basolateral,
cortical, central, and medial nuclei.
Arterioles within the brain normally exist in a partially constricted
state, from which they dilate to deliver blood on demand.
To simulate this, we preconstricted arterioles in amygdala brain
slices with the thromboxane-mimetic 9,11-dideoxy-9α,11α-methanoepoxy
prostaglandin F
2α
(U46619; 125 nM); the degree of
constriction produced by this agent was not affected by stress
(Fig. 2E, Inset). We used electrical field stimulation (EFS) to
depolarize neurons and initiate NVC. This manipulation evoked
an increase in astrocytic endfoot Ca2+ that immediately preceded
vasodilation (Fig. 2 C and D). In control arterioles, the EFS-
evoked vasodilation was robust and sustained throughout the
1-min recording period after the onset of EFS. In contrast, vasodilation
was both smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration
in vessels in slices from stressed rats (Fig. 2 A–D and Movies S1
and S2). Indeed, we observed a 66% reduction in the peak arteriolar
luminal diameter change evoked by EFS in slices from
stressed rats compared with those from controls (Fig. 2E).
Because the level of astrocytic endfoot Ca2+ is a key determinant
of the neurovascular response (23), a reduction in EFS-
evoked vasodilation in slices from stressed animals could reflect
a blunted elevation of endfoot Ca2+. However, according to our
Ca2+analysis (SI Materials and Methods), the peak endfoot [Ca2+]
i
evoked by neuronal stimulation was significantly higher after
stress, and we observed a strong trend (P= 0.11) suggesting that
resting endfoot [Ca2+]
i
was also elevated (Fig. 2F).
Collectively, these observations suggest that, despite elevated
endfoot Ca2+ signaling, communication between astrocytic endfeet
and vascular myocytes is disrupted by stress.
Decreased K
IR
Channel Activity Contributes to Neurovascular Coupling
Impairment in Situ. Barium (Ba2+) ions are relatively potent
blockers of K
IR
2 channel members (24). We previously reported
that, in cortical brain slices, inhibition of K
IR
channels with Ba2+
(100 μM) reduced NVC by ∼70% (19). In amygdala slices from
control rats, 100 μM Ba 2+ decreased the magnitude of EFS-
evoked vasodilation by ∼50% (Fig. 3 A and C), but this manipulation
had no effect on evoked dilations in slices from
stressed rats (Fig. 3B andC). These results indicate that a K
IR
-
dependent component of NVC is lost after 1 wk of stress. Ba2+
had no overall effect on U46619-induced tone (Fig. 3D).
Elevation of bath K+ to 10 mM also causes arteriolar dilation
in slices through SM K
IR
channel activation, without engagement
of local neurons or astrocytes (19, 23). Raising K+ to 10 mM to
directly test SM K
IR
function dilated PAs by 52% in control slices
but had little effect on arterioles in slices from stressed animals
(Fig. S1). This finding indicates that PAs in situ from stressed
animals are less responsive to small increases in extracellular K+
concentration ([K+]
o
), despite a substantial vasodilatory reserve.
Responses to Extracellular K+ Manipulation Are Diminished in
Isolated Parenchymal Arterioles from Stressed Rats. To examine
the effects of stressor exposure on the cerebral vasculature more
closely, we explored the responses of isolated amygdalar PAs
from stressed and nonstressed rats to elevated [K+]
o
. Elevation
of intravascular pressure to 40 mm Hg constricted arterioles
from both control and stressed groups by 45% (Fig. 4B,Inset). In
control arteries, elevating [K+]
o
from 3 mM to 8 mM caused a
substantial vasodilation, which was sustained during subsequent
elevations to 15 and 20 mM. Further elevations in [K+]
o
to 25,
30, and 60 mM resulted in substantial vasoconstriction (Fig. 4A,
Upper, and Fig. 4B). In contrast, in arterioles from stressed rats,
the magnitude of vasodilation evoked by increasing [K+]
o
to
8 mM was significantly smaller than that in control arterioles,
and a similar effect was seen at 15 mM. At 20 mM [K+]
o
the
responses of control and stressed arterioles were opposite, with
controls exhibiting a substantial dilation and stressed arterioles
exhibiting a modest constriction. Furthermore, the magnitude of
vasoconstriction evoked by 60 mM [K+]
o
was significantly reduced
in arterioles from stressed rats (Fig. 4A, Lower, and Fig.
4B). These results indicate that the defect in the K
IR
channelmediated
dilatory responses of PAs to elevated [K+]
o
resides in
the arterioles.
Vasodilation of PAs to K+ is likely caused by activation of
K
IR
2.1, but not K
IR
2.2, channels (25). Consistent with this, we
observed a lower abundance of K
IR
2.1 (but not K
IR
2.2) mRNA
in PAs after stress, indicating decreased expression of the K
IR
2.1
channel gene (Fig. S2).

K
IR
Channel Current Density Is Decreased in Isolated Myocytes from
Amygdalar PAs of Stressed Rats. An elevation of [K+]
o
increases
the K+ conductance of K
IR
channels to drive the myocyte resting
membrane potential (∼−35 mV) (26) to the new potassium
equilibrium potential (E
K
). Provided that E
K
is negative to−35 mV
(i.e., [K+]
o
is<25 mM), elevation of [K+]
o
will cause membrane
potential hyperpolarization and thereby deactivate L-type voltage-dependent
Ca2+ channels, decreasing Ca2+ influx to cause
vasorelaxation (27). Our observations that PA dilations to small
increases in [K+]
o
are impaired and K
IR
2.1 transcript is reduced
in stressed animals suggested that myocyte K
IR
channel function
may be compromised by stress. To directly address this possibility
, we measured whole-cell currents in response to a voltage
ramp protocol in myocytes isolated from amygdalar PAs of
control and stressed rats, using 60 mM [K+]
o
to amplify inward
K
IR
currents (E
K
= −23 mV). In stressed myocytes, inward
currents were significantly smaller at voltages negative to E
K
,
consistent with a loss of K
IR
channel currents (Fig. 5 A and B).
However, outward currents at +40 mV (Control: 10.94 ± 1.21
pA/pF, n = 24; Stress: 8.03 ± 0.88 pA/pF, n = 13) were unaffected
, suggesting a lack of an effect on voltage-dependent K+
currents. To test whether the K
IR
current density differed between
stressed and control rats, we superfused cells with 100 μM
Ba2+. We observed that the Ba2+-sensitive current was reduced
by 90% in stressed myocytes compared with controls (Fig. 5 C
and D), indicating that stress reduces the number of functional
K
IR
channels in the SM membrane of PAs.
Glucocorticoid Signaling Mediates NVC Impairment by Stress. It is
well established that exposure to a range of stressors evokes a
rapid and sustained increase in circulating corticosterone, and this
has been linked to changes in neuronal function in the amygdala
(28). This corticosterone response may habituate in response to
chronic homotypic stressor exposure, but habituation does not
occur in response to the presentation of heterotypic stressors,
such as those used in our paradigm (29) (Fig. S3).
To exert effects on neurons, corticosterone must first pass
through the endothelial and SM cells of the vasculature, where
it may interact with ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid
receptors (GRs) (30, 31). Therefore, we hypothesized that Fig. 2. NVC is impaired by stress. (A) Representative baseline diameter and

values of Fluo-4 AM fluorescence indicated by the

with 125 nM U46619 (Inset) was unchanged (control: 41%±2%

difference in the vasodilatory capacity of arterioles between groups. Despite
this, stressed arterioles dilated less than control arterioles (control: 38%±4%

NVC impairment is mediated by stress-evoked corticosterone–
GR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we sought to mimic the
stressor-induced increase in corticosterone (in the absence of
stressor delivery) by injecting corticosterone s.c. at a dose (2.5
mg/kg) (32) designed to match the increase in circulating corticosterone
observed after exposure to the type of stressors used in
our paradigm (Fig. S3). Corticosterone delivery once per day for
7 d in lieu of stressor exposure produced an impairment of NVC
similar to that produced by stress. Under these conditions, EFS-
evoked vasodilations were reduced by ∼43% compared with
those observed in slices from rats treated with vehicle (Fig. 6 A
and B). Vehicle delivery itself had no effect on the magnitude of
EFS-evoked vasodilations compared with responses evoked in
slices from noninjected animals (Figs. 2E and 6B). The level
of preconstriction induced by U46619 was the same in vessels
from both vehicle-treated and corticosterone-treated rats (Fig.
6B, Inset).
We also examined the effect of inhibiting GR signaling with
the antagonist RU486. Intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg
RU486 1 h before stressor exposure abolished the effect of stress
on NVC. In slices from treated animals, EFS evoked a vasodilation
(Fig. 6 C and D) that was no different from that evoked in
normal control animals (Fig. 2 C and E). In contrast, EFS-
evoked vasodilations in slices from animals that received vehicle
1 h before stressor exposure were significantly smaller than those
in slices from animals treated with RU486 (Fig. 6 C and D) and
were comparable to responses evoked in slices from noninjected
stressed rats (Fig. 2E). U46619-induced preconstriction was not
different between groups (Fig. 6D, Inset).
Discussion
Traditionally, studies of the effects of stress on the central nervous
system have focused on neurons. Here we demonstrate a
previously unidentified relationship between stressor exposure
and the astrocytes and vascular myocytes of the amygdalar
neurovascular unit, and provide evidence that NVC is compromised
by stress. Our results show that stress leads to a glucocorticoid-mediated
disruption of K+-driven PA vasodilation
during NVC, through impaired SM K
IR
channel function. These
studies unveil a multifaceted effect of stress on the cells of the
neurovascular unit and suggest that blood flow to the amygdala
may be compromised during NVC in the stressed brain.
Using a previously characterized chronic stress paradigm (21)
that produced an anxiety-like behavioral phenotype, we found
that stress caused a robust impairment of NVC and made the key
observation that EFS-evoked vasodilation is attenuated in brain
slices from stressed rats (Fig. 2). This effect was not due to a
blunted elevation of endfoot Ca2+ in response to neuronal activity
; in fact, EFS elicited an enhanced astrocytic endfoot Ca2+
response after stress. These larger magnitude endfoot Ca2+
transients in stressed slices may be related to an increase in
amygdalar neuronal activity in chronically stressed animals (2,
22). Our previous work showed that elevation of astrocytic
endfoot Ca2+ by EFS or Ca2+ uncaging can cause either dilation

stressed: 30% ± 7%); this same phenomenon was observed in a subsequent
step to 15 mM [K+]

were slightly constricted relative to baseline (control: 23% ± 7% dilation;
stressed:−5%± 5% constriction). Upon raising [K+]

or constriction, and that the polarity of the response is determined
by the endfoot Ca2+ concentration (23). In that study,
we did not observe attenuated dilations at endfoot Ca2+ levels
intermediate between those causing dilation (mean 350 nM) and
constriction (mean 730 nM), that is, the response was bimodal
(23). Thus, at the peak endfoot Ca2+measured after stress in this
study (644 nM), we would have predicted a vasoconstrictor response
, but we actually observed blunted vasodilations. This
finding may suggest that the Ca22+-dependent release of vasoactive
substances from endfeet is altered by stress and furthermore
, that the signal transduction machinery of the underlying
SM may be affected.
Our observation that vasodilatory responses to small increases
in [K+]
o
—mediated by the activation of myocyte K
IR
channels—
were severely reduced in isolated vessels prompted us to investigate
the effects of stress on this channel in more detail. We
found that stress down-regulated PA K
IR
2.1 mRNA expression,
an effect that was accompanied by a sevenfold reduction in K
IR
channel current density in PA myocytes isolated from stressed
rats. This latter effect is similar to that induced in healthy SM by
pharmacological blockade of K
IR
channels with Ba2+ (Fig. 5D
and ref. 33), and this maneuver normally inhibits EFS-induced
vasodilation in slices (Fig. 3Aand ref. 19). However, we found no
effect of Ba2+ ions on the residual EFS-evoked vasodilations in
brain slices from stressed rats. Moreover, dilatory responses to
raising [K+]
o
were significantly blunted in slices from stressed
rats compared with those in controls. Taken together, these
observations are consistent with a model in which K
IR
channel
function is impaired after stress.
We then sought to further define the molecular pathway linking
stress and NVC impairment. Stress-related neurotransmitter
and/or neuropeptide release (for example, CRF and tPA) (34),
inflammatory processes (35), sympathetic nervous system activation
, and/or activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis (36) could each contribute to the NVC impairment
we observed. Activation of the HPA axis involves the secretion of
adrenocorticotropic hormone from the anterior pituitary, which
results in the downstream release of glucocorticoids from the
adrenal cortex (36). These glucocorticoids can interact with
mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and GRs to mediate their
effects. MRs are almost saturated at basal corticosteroid levels
(37), whereas the lower affinity GRs represent a substantial receptor
pool that is available for mediating the effects of the increased
circulating steroids resulting from stressor exposure (37).
In the brain, GRs are broadly expressed in neurons in a range
of subregions, including the amygdala (38, 39), and are also
expressed to a lesser extent in astrocytes (39). GRs are also
found in SM (30) and endothelial cells (31). Because many
effects of stressor exposure are mediated by glucocorticoid signaling
through GRs, we chose to study the effects of manipulating
GR signaling and corticosterone—the principal glucocorticoid
hormone in rat—on NVC. Not only were we able to mimic NVC
impairment by delivering corticosterone in place of stressors, but
we were also able to abrogate the effects of stress on NVC by
antagonizing GRs during stressor exposure. These data thus
imply that corticosterone signaling via GRs is a key mediator of
NVC impairment after chronic stress. The simplest interpretation
of these results is that corticosterone exerts a direct
effect on abundant SM GRs (30). Upon binding corticosterone,
GRs translocate to the nucleus, where they mediate transactivation
or transrepression of target genes (36). According to
our data, it seems likely that, after stress, corticosterone/GR
complexes in the SM directly down-regulate K
IR
2.1 gene expression
, leading to fewer functional channels in the myocyte membrane.
However, the transcriptional regulation of other genes
whose products interact with the K
IR
channel is also possible.
Collectively, our observations suggest a model (Fig. S4) in 
which stress-induced glucocorticoid signaling causes a decrease
in functional K
IR
channels in the SM membrane. This impairs
the ability of the vessel to respond to local increases in [K+]
o
during NVC, leading to suboptimal vasodilation, which could
lead to decreased regional cerebral blood flow in stressed animals
during a hyperemic response. Although our results implicate
this mechanism as a major contributor to NVC impairment
after chronic stress, it remains possible that interactions of corticosterone
with GRs in other cell types in the neurovascular unit
could lead to further remodeling of neurovascular communication
, and other NVC mediators could also be altered. For example
, EETs signaling, which plays a role in NVC under normal
circumstances (18), could be affected by stress through effects on
the expression and/or function of the enzymes responsible for the
production of these molecules. Another unexplored possibility is
that NVC in brain regions other than the amygdala may also be
impaired. These remain questions for in-depth future studies.
Accumulating evidence implicates impaired NVC and cerebral
blood flow in a range of pathologies, many of which have a
stress component. These include hypertension (40), stroke (41),
Alzheimer’s disease (42), and affective disorders such as depression
(43) and schizophrenia (44). It has been suggested that
cerebral hypoperfusion in some of these disorders leads to
metabolic stress and eventual neuronal dysfunction and cognitive
impairment (e.g., ref. 42). In slices from stressed rats, we observed
a 66% reduction in the magnitude of the vasodilation
evoked by neuronal activity. Our data thus predict a substantial
reduction in the volume of blood delivered to the tissue during
functional hyperemia and therefore, after chronic stress, brain
regions in which NVC is impaired may experience functional hypoperfusion.
Stress induces synaptic plasticity and neuronal hypertrophy
in the amygdala, which leads to neuronal hyperactivity and
Fig. 6. Corticosterone signaling via GRs is a key mediator of NVC impairment.

behavioral changes (22). Presumably, neurons in this state have
even higher energy demands than those in the nonstressed
condition, but our results suggest that the delivery of substrates
critical for energy production will be decreased after repeated
stress. It is thus possible that stress precipitates a state of metabolic
imbalance that, if persistent, could have detrimental
effects on neuronal function over time. Further experiments will
aim to explore this possibility.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that—in addition to
effects on neurons—stress impacts the cells of the neurovascular
unit, leading to a marked impairment of NVC in the amygdala.
We show that stress impairs NVC by reducing the number of
functional K
IR
channels in the membrane of PA myocytes. This
renders arterioles less sensitive to small increases in local K+
released by astrocytes, thereby impairing K+-mediated vasodilation
during NVC and, by extension, blunting the increase in blood
flow needed to support local neuronal activity. This mechanism
for the disruption of neurovascular communication may be important
in diseases in which NVC is defective. Moreover, because
stress is a contributory factor in many disease states, the NVC
impairment elucidated here may be an important early step on
the path to neuronal dysfunction and as such may represent
a novel target for preventing or treating diseases associated with
stressor exposure.
