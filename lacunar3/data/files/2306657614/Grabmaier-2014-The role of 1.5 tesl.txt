Abstract
Accurate assessment of left ventricular function in rodent models is essential for the evaluation of new therapeutic
approaches for cardiac diseases. In our study, we provide new insights regarding the role of a 1.5 Tesla (T) magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) device and different anesthetic regimens on data validity. As dedicated small animal MRI and
echocardiographic devices are not broadly available, we evaluated whether monitoring cardiac function in small rodents
with a clinical 1.5 T MRI device is feasible. On a clinical electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronized 1.5 T MRI scanner we therefore
studied cardiac function parameters of mice with chronic virus-induced cardiomyopathy. Thus, reduced left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) could be verified compared to healthy controls. However, our results showed a high variability. First,
anesthesia with medetomidine, midazolam and fentanyl (MMF) led to depressed cardiac function parameters and more
variability than isoflurane gas inhalation anesthesia, especially at high concentrations. Furthermore, calculation of an
average ejection fraction value from sequenced scans significantly reduced the variance of the results. To sum up, we
introduce the clinical 1.5 T MRI device as a new tool for effective analysis of left ventricular function in mice with
cardiomyopathy. Besides, we suggest isoflurane gas inhalation anesthesia at high concentrations for variance reduction and
recommend calculation of an average ejection fraction value from multiple sequenced MRI scans to provide valid data and a
solid basis for further clinical testing.

Introduction
Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart which is
frequently caused by viral pathogens. Patients present with varying
clinical symptoms ranging from mild dyspnea and benign cardiac
arrhythmias to cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac death [1]. In
genetically susceptible individuals, viral infection of the heart can
trigger ongoing myocardial inflammation subsequently leading to
dilative cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure [2]. In these
patients, optimized medication often represents the only therapeutic
option, though frequent progression to end stage heart
failure and death cannot be avoided [2–4]. Hence, new
therapeutic strategies targeting acute inflammation and/or preventing
the onset of dilative cardiomyopathy are crucial. In the
process of developing new therapeutic approaches, animal models
play an essential role. Since left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) strongly predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,
it is often used for monitoring therapeutic success [5–8]. Several
techniques, such as pressure-volume loops [9], echocardiography
[10] or dedicated small animal MRI scanners [11] have been
implemented for evaluation of left ventricular function in mice.
However, 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners have not been used routinely
for cardiac function monitoring in murine models of dilative
cardiomyopathy (DCM) so far.
Against this background, the objective of this pilot study was
providing the feasibility of cardiac function evaluation by magnetic
resonance imaging with a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner in
coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infected mice, a mouse model for viral
myocarditis and dilative cardiomyopathy. We therefore assessed
left ventricular function parameters in coxsackievirus B3 infected
mice and compared them to healthy controls. In order to verify
our results with a more standardized imaging technique, we
compared our data to results obtained with a dedicated small
animal echocardiographic device. Furthermore, we compared the
anesthetic regimen used in the MRI study with different
concentrations of isoflurane to assess the optimal anesthetic
conditions for data acquisition.

Materials and Methods
Animal model
SWR/J (H-2q) male mice (The Jackson Laboratories, USA)
were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 16105 plaque forming
units (pfu) of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) [12], which finally resulted
in a phenotype of dilative cardiomyopathy after several weeks p.i.
as described [13,14].
Cardiac function of 22 infected mice (SWR/J) was assessed by
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) eight weeks after
CVB3 infection. For comparison of LVEF, 7 healthy mice (SWR/
J) were tested as well. For comparison of left ventricular volumes
and cardiac output, 4 age matched mice were used respectively.
Healthy, 6–8 week old male BALB/c mice were used for
evaluation of cardiac function by echocardiography. Animal care
and all experimental procedures were performed in strict
accordance to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and were approved by the
local animal care and use committees of the district government of
Baden-Wu ¨rttemberg.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
For reliable electrocardiographic (ECG) synchronization and
high resolution imaging, a dedicated small animal ECG device
(1025-MR, SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY) and a
microscopy coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, NL), which is
clinically used for finger imaging, were applied. All imaging
procedures were performed on a clinical 1.5 T Philips Achieva
MR scanner using a clinical gradient system (30 mT/m, 150 mT/
m/ms). Animals (SWR/J) were anesthetized with fentanyl (10 mg/
kg), medetomidine (1 mg/kg) and midazolam (2 mg/kg) (MMF)
and imaged in prone position with the thorax positioned on top of
the microscopy single loop surface coil (D = 2.3 mm). Highresolution
MRI sequences for assessment of myocardial function
and morphology were implemented. Cine MRI was performed
with prospective ECG triggering using a spoiled gradient echo
technique. Imaging parameters included repetition time/echo
time (TR/TE) = 18 ms/6.5 ms, flip angle = 30u, averages = 1, field
of view (FOV) = 35 mm, matrix = 128 resulting in a spatial
resolution of 0.2260.2261 mm at a temporal resolution of
18 ms. Ejection fraction was determined by evaluation of end
diastolic volumes (EDV) and end systolic volumes (ESV) in short
axis view in seven slices with an in-house developed IDL 6.1 based
software package. Calculation of left ventricular ejection fraction
(in %) was conducted via the formula ((EDV-ESV)/EDV)*100.
Echocardiographic imaging
Anesthesia of 6–8 week old, healthy male BALB/c mice
(Charles River, Germany) was performed with 2% isoflurane. As
ejection fractions of different mouse strains are comparable
[11,15–17], a mouse strain which is easily accessible (BALB/c)
was used in this study. Once fully anesthetized, the mice were
transferred to a heated platform (40uC) ensuring a stable body
temperature of 34.5–35.5uC. Anesthesia was maintained with
1.75% or 3% isoflurane or intraperitoneal injection of 100 ml
MMF. Transthoracic echocardiographic short-axis M-mode images
(Fig. 1F) were obtained with a Vevo2100 imaging system
(VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) using a 40 MHz transducer.
Parasternal long-axis M-mode was used to standardize transducer
positioning for short-axis M-mode imaging. For evaluation of
cardiac function, 3 consecutive cycles were measured and
averaged as described previously [10,18]. Left ventricular end
diastolic (EDV) and systolic (ESV) volumes were calculated using
the formulae 7*LVID;d3/(2.4+LVID;d) and 7*LVID;s3/
(2.4+LVID;s). Calculation of left ventricular ejection fraction (in
%) was conducted via the formula ((EDV-ESV)/EDV)*100.
Cardiac index was defined as cardiac output divided by body
weight as previously described [19].
Statistical analysis
Data is shown as mean6 standard deviation (SD). Data was
evaluated for normal distribution by the Anderson-Darling-Test.
Comparison between two groups was performed using the
unpaired t-test, if data was normally distributed. If values were
significantly different from normal distribution, Mann-Whitney-U-
test was used for statistical testing. Values of p,0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Data were analysed using
Microsoft Office 2010 and the statistical software PAST v2.17c
[20]. Dot plot figures were designed with SPSS statistics 21.

Results
Evaluation of cardiac function using a clinical 1.5 T MRI
device
In this model of cardiomyopathy, cardiac function of 22 CVB3-
infected mice was assessed using cine MRI and results were
matched with up to 7 healthy controls in order to evaluate the
grade of systolic impairment. In figure 1A–C, representative MRI-
gained slides in short axis, two-chamber and four-chamber view
are shown. Table 1 shows end diastolic volume, end systolic
volume, stroke volume (SV), left ventricular ejection fraction,
cardiac output (CO), cardiac mass (mass) and heart rate (HR).
LVEF was significantly reduced by 11% in coxsackievirus B3
infected mice compared to healthy controls. EDV of infected mice
and healthy controls was not significantly different (44611 ml vs.
52612 ml, p = 0.26). There was no ESV difference between the
two groups as well (2667 ml in CVB3-infected mice and 2767 ml
in healthy mice, p = 0.79). SV of infected mice was decreased by
,28% (1865 ml in CVB3-infected mice and 2565 ml in healthy
mice, p = 0.06) and heart mass was comparable between groups
(52610 ml in CVB3-infected mice and 5865 ml in healthy mice,
p = 0.09). Finally, calculation of cardiac output (CO) revealed
reduction of 38% in infected mice – this trend was almost
statistically significant (3.861.4 ml/min in CVB3-infected mice
and 6.161.6p ml/min in healthy mice, p = 0.06).
Our clinical 1.5 Tesla device included a microscopy coil which
is clinically used for finger imaging and resulted in a lower signalto-noise
ratio in comparison to dedicated small animal 7 to 11.7
Tesla MRI devices combined with high-end gradient systems. In
practice, this led to an increase of standard deviations. As shown in
table 2, standard deviations for left ventricular volumes and
cardiac function exceeded the values from indicated studies up to
four times regardless of the mouse model used. These findings
were consistent for diseased mice as well as for healthy controls.
LVEF in our study (52.02%67.72) was reduced by ,20%
compared to MRI data of healthy control mice (mean 62.463.1%)
[11,16,17,21].
Validation of LVEF-results by echocardiography
(Vevo2100)
As shown in table 2, LVEF of healthy control mice was reduced
by ,20% compared to results obtained from several indicated
study groups. To evaluate whether the reduced ejection fraction
was due to the chosen anesthetic regimen, we analyzed cardiac
function of healthy mice with a dedicated small animal echocardiographic
device as well. Figure 1D–F shows representative echoimages
of short-axis view, parasternal long-axis view and M-mode
of parasternal short-axis view. As shown in figure 2, evaluation of
cardiac function with the echocardiographic device resulted in
similar results for (A) ejection fraction (55.763.2% vs. 52.067.7%,
p = 0.28), (B) heart rate (198651/min vs. 246616/min, p = 0.07)
and cardiac output (6.161.7 ml/min vs. 6.161.6 ml/min,
p = 0.96) when mice were anesthetized with the same regimen as
used in the MRI study.
Isoflurane gas inhalation anesthesia of the same population
revealed higher values for LVEF similar to the values obtained by
other groups (table 2), indicating that the LVEF values obtained in
our MRI study were due to the sedation protocol. Nevertheless,
the standard deviation for LVEF was more than 2 times higher for
MRI assessment of LVEF (relative SD 5.7% vs. 14.8%).
Cardiodepressive effects of MMF
Data regarding effects of MMF on myocardial contraction and
heart rate are scarce compared to data on ketamine/xylazine or

from MMF anesthetized mice investigated by MRI. B) Heart rates (HR) and C) cardiac output (CO) measured by our Vevo2100 system did not
significantly differ from those in the MRI study. D) Anesthesia with isoflurane revealed the cardiodepressive effects of MMF. n.s.: not significant;

isoflurane [22]. Thus, we concentrated on cardiodepressive effects
and compared ventricular volumes, cardiac function parameters
and heart rates of healthy male BALB/c mice with respect to
different anesthetic regimens (MMF, 1.75% isoflurane and 3%
isoflurane). As shown in table 3, anesthesia with MMF results in a
distinct depression of cardiac contractility (20% relative reduction
of LVEF) and a dramatic deterioration of heart rate (relative
reduction of 42–47%, figure 3D) and heart rate-dependent
parameters such as cardiac output (relative reduction of 53–
57%, figure 3E) and cardiac index (relative reduction of 60–63%,
figure 3F). No differences were seen between the 1.75% and 3%
isoflurane group (figure 2D and figure 3D–F), indicating that
higher concentrations of isoflurane have no impact on cardiac
function.
Impact of the anesthetic regimen on the variability of the
results
Next, we studied whether the anesthetic regimen MMF also has
an impact on the variability of cardiac measurements. Therefore,
we compared cardiac function parameters under MMF, 1.75%
isoflurane (isoflurane is commonly used at concentrations of 1.25–
2.25% for maintenance of anesthesia) and 3% isoflurane. As
depicted in figure 3A+B, MMF resulted in very high standard
deviations for heart rate and heart rate dependent values. On the
Figure 3. Anesthesia with isoflurane reduces variability of data. Compared to MMF, isoflurane is able to reduce the variability of the results.
Additionally, isoflurane at higher concentrations than commonly used might further reduce the variability of heart rate and heart rate dependent
values such as cardiac output and cardiac index. However, compared with lower isoflurane concentrations (1.75%), high isoflurane concentrations
(3%) show no significant cardiodepressive effects. A) Shows percentual standard deviations of single cycle values, and B) of mean values (average of 3
consecutive cycles). (C) Shows percentual standard deviations for cardiac output and cardiac index obtained with either MMF, 1.75% isoflurane or 3%
isoflurane. D) Shows heart rate, E) cardiac output and F) cardiac index under different anesthetic regimens. EF = LVEF, EDV = end diastolic volume,
ESV = end systolic volume, SV = stroke volume, HR = heart rate, CO = cardiac output, CI = cardiac index. 100 ml MMF: n = 6, 1.75% isoflurane and 3%
isoflurane: n = 7. ***: p,0.001.

one hand, variance of LVEF was similar in all groups. On the
other hand, 3% isoflurane had the best influence on heart rate
(especially in single cycle values, see figure 3A) and heart rate
dependent values such as cardiac output and cardiac index
(figure 3A–C and E+F). This indicates that high isoflurane
concentrations might be preferable for assessment of cardiac
output and cardiac index.
Impact of calculating an average LVEF value on the
variability of the results
In small animal echocardiography, multiple cycle measurements
are commonly used to calculate an average value for LVEF in
order to reduce variability of the results [10]. In most MRI studies
however, cine imaging results in the calculation of only one single
LVEF value [22–24]. In order to investigate the effect of
calculating an average LVEF value on the variability of the
results, we analyzed the variability of 3 different heart cycles and
compared it with the mean values (average of 3 consecutive cycles).
As shown in figure 4, the mean values consisting of 3 different
measurements showed lower interindividual differences for all
cardiac function parameters than single cycle measurements. This
effect was independent from the anesthetic regimen used.
Compared to the highest standard deviation of single cycle
measurements, the standard deviation of LVEF was reduced by
,45% in the 1.75% isoflurane group,,38% in the 3% isoflurane
group and by,45% in the 100 ml MMF group, indicating that
acquisition of multiple cine images could be a powerful tool to
reduce variability on the 1.5 T MRI device.
Discussion
Many techniques have been implemented in the past to
measure cardiac function in small animals. Pressure-volume loops
can be obtained via Millar tip catheterization, but repetitive
measurements are not possible in this setting. Echocardiography
using clinical echo devices is often used in animal models, but
provides a weak spatial resolution and is known to have a high
inter- and intra-observer variability [25]. Dedicated small animal
echocardiographic devices (e.g. VisualSonics Vevo2100) are very
cost-intensive. Finally, 9.4 T MRI scanners dedicated to small
animals have been shown to have high spatial and temporal
resolutions [11,26,27], but are not broadly available.
In our pilot study we show that clinical 1.5 T MRI driven
evaluation of left ventricular function in mice with mild
cardiomyopathy is feasible, although some limitations and lessons
from small animal echocardiography need to be considered.
As our data show, the variability of values obtained using a
clinical 1.5 T MRI device is higher than in studies using dedicated
small animal MRI or echocardiographic devices. This limitation
needs to be considered regarding future study designs, as group
sizes need to be increased in order to identify significant changes of
left ventricular function parameters.
In order to find possible solutions for the high variability and an
explanation for the depressed cardiac function of healthy controls,
we verified our 1.5 T MRI results with a dedicated small animal
echocardiographic device. As demonstrated above, calculation of
an average LVEF as known from small animal echocardiography
[10] could reduce the scattering of the values gained from 1.5 T

MRI devices. Thereby, a relative reduction of standard deviation
of up to 38–45% could be achieved.
Throughout literature, many anesthetic regimen including
thiopental [28], 222-tribromoethanol [23], isoflurane at different
concentrations (usually 1.25%–2.25%) [17,22,29] and ketamine/
xylazine [22] have been used for evaluation of cardiac function in
mice. In this article, we show that the anesthetic regimen may not
only have distinct impact on cardiac function but also on the
variability of the results. We showed that MMF has a marked
effect on cardiac function (20% reduction of LVEF, 40%
reduction of heart rate and 60% reduction of cardiac index
compared to isoflurane), which makes this regimen impractical for
evaluation of cardiac function. Furthermore we found, that MMF
has a distinct impact on the variability of heart rate-dependent
values. In contrary, higher concentrations of isoflurane than
commonly used [10,11,17] proved to have a beneficial effect on
heart rate variability.
Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. First, we only
assessed healthy controls under the mentioned anesthetic regimens.
Therefore, we are not able to predict the effects of the
anesthetics in mice with severe cardiomyopathies. Eventually,
higher isoflurane concentrations might show a distinct cardiodepressive
effect in these mice leading to higher dropout rates.
Second, the parasternal short axis M-Mode we used to assess
cardiac function parameters is not as accurate as e.g. the LV-trace
mode, which much more considers regional wall motion
abnormalities.
To sum up, evaluation of LVEF changes in virus-induced
cardiomyopathy with a clinical 1.5 Tesla MRI is feasible for serial
monitoring of cardiac function and validation for novel therapeutic
strategies. Calculation of an averaged LVEF value reduces
variability. Furthermore, choice of the anesthetic regimen has
essential influence on the results of cardiac measurements.
