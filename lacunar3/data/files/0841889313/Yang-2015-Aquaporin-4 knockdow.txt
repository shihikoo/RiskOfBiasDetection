Abstract
Emerging evidence indicates that the water channel protein
aquaporin 4 (AQP4) plays an essential role in water homeostasis
and is implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema. This
study aimed to understand the physiological role of AQP4 in
hypoxia–ischemia-mediated cytotoxic brain edema. We specifically
knocked down AQP4 expression by intracerebral injection
of a plasmid containing AQP4 siRNA into a neonatal piglet
model. The success of the hypoxia–ischemia-induced piglet
model was confirmed by conventional magnetic resonance
imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. AQP4 knockdown
led to reduced brain edema accompanied by a higher apparent
diffusion coefficient value, compared to the control group
injected with a plasmid containing scrambled siRNA. Realtime
polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed that AQP4 siRNA significantly reduced
AQP4 mRNA and protein expression. Finally, neurological
function analysis revealed that AQP4 knockdown significantly
improved neurobehavioral manifestation of the piglets after
exposure to hypoxia-ischemia. Taken together, these results
indicate that AQP4 plays an important role in mediating brain
edema in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Therefore, AQP4
could be a therapeutic target to ameliorate early-stage brain
edema.V C 2015 IUBMB Life, 67(3):182–190, 2015

Introduction
Cerebral edema is a potentially life-threatening complication
that is associated with many common neurological disorders.
Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is one of the most
important causes of neurological disabilities during childhood
(1,2). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tool that can
detect neonatal brain injury and cerebral edema, and it plays
an important role in predicting neurological outcomes in neonates
with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (3–5). Conventional
T1- and T2-weighted images are used most often; but the findings
may be normal despite significant brain injury, especially
when imaging is performed early after the event. Instead,
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) often reveals hypoxicischemic
brain injury at an earlier stage than conventional
MRI (6,7). In addition, DWI provides quantitative apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) values in brain tissues (8,9).
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a small 30-kDa monomer, is a hydrophobic
transmembrane protein with cytosolic amino and carboxy
terminal ends (10). AQP4 is abundantly expressed in
astrocytes and plays a key role in the development of brain
edema (11). As a member of water channel family proteins on
the plasma membrane, AQP4 plays a critical role in water
homeostasis and edema in the brain (12–14). Hypoxic–ischemic
and traumatic injuries that cause cerebral edema have

been reported to be accompanied by severe astrocyte swelling
and upregulated AQP4 expression (15–17).
Using an ischemic rat brain model, AQP4 expression was
shown to be marginally increased in non-neuronal cells at day
1 postinduction but became significantly increased by day 3
(15). Notably, the changes in AQP4 expression paralleled the
changes in edema as demonstrated on MRI (15,18,19). Upregulation
of AQP4 may occur during trauma-induced cytotoxic
edema in rats, and the outcome becomes worse with the
upregulation of AQP4 (8), whereas edema is less severe with
the downregulation or knockout of AQP4 during cytotoxic
edema (20,21). In addition, the attenuation of brain edema
was observed in an AQP4-knockout mouse model, suggesting
that the depletion of AQP4 may be protective during cytotoxic
brain edema (22). However, most of the data currently available
on the role of AQP4 in ischemic brain edema are based
on small animal models such as mice and rats. Whether AQP4
critically contributes to the development of brain edema in
larger animals and human neonates remains largely unknown.
Therefore, in present study, we established a neonatal piglet
model of brain edema and employed an RNA interference
approach to knock down AQP4 expression in order to elucidate
the role of AQP4 in hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain edema. In
addition, we investigated the value of DWI for the early prediction
of the neurological outcome in neonates with hypoxicischemic
encephalopathy and the relationship between the
ADC value and neurobehavioral outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Construction of AQP4 siRNA Vector
RNA duplexes of 21 nucleotides specific for porcine AQP4 were
designed based on the mRNA sequence in gene bank (EU:
165525). From the open reading frame of the AQP1 and AQP4
mRNA sequences, duplexes of the type AA (N19) UU were
designed to obtain a 21-nt sense and 21-nt antisense strand
with symmetric 2-nt 30 overhangs of identical sequence. The
selected 10 siRNA sequences were submitted to a BLAST
search to avoid the targeting of other homologous genes. The
best siRNA sequence was chemically synthesized, and the plasmid
containing the AQP4 siRNA was constructed by Invitrogen
(Shanghai, China). The AQP4 siRNA sequences were as follows
: sense, 50-GGUCUCCUGGUAGAGUUGAUAAUCA-30; and
antisense, 50-UGAUUAUCAACUCUACCAGGAGACC-30, corresponding
to 420–440 bp of the porcine cDNA sequence. In
addition, the noninterference siRNA sequence at the same
position was designed as the control: sense, 50-GGUCCGUUGG
AGAUUAGAUAUCUCA-30; and antisense, 50-UGAGAUAUCUAA
UCUCCAACGGACC-30.
Piglet Model and Groups
Hypoxia-Ischemia and Surgical Procedure. All piglets were
maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH; Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, 1996), and the animal experiments were performed
under approved protocols of the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Dalian Medical University.
Piglets were premedicated with an intramuscular injection
of atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg). After 20–30 min, anesthesia
was administered by intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium
pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). Once unconscious, the piglets were
positioned on the operating table with a slight extension of the
head. The incision site and an extensive area surrounding it
were disinfected with a povidone-iodine solution immediately
before draping. Analgesia was provided by locally administering
a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine before cutting the
skin. An 8-cm longitudinal incision was made on the midline
of the neck to expose the carotid arteries well on both sides.
The carotid arteries were then suture ligated at the distal and
proximal sites of the heart by 4-0 fine silk. The incisions were
then stitched. Blood samples were collected with proper anticoagulants
for blood gas analysis and serum enzymology testing
before suture ligation of the carotid artery and before the
brain were taken. The piglets were put into a closed anoxic
tank filled with a mixture of 4% oxygen and 96% nitrogen at
2 L/min for 30 min.
After surgery, the animals were monitored in a recovery
room, and pain relief was supplied with a subcutaneous injection
of morphine (0.3 mg/kg). Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g.,
penicillin) were administered by intramuscular injection from
2 days before to 5 days after the surgical procedure.
Animal Groups
A total of 16 male and 16 female newborn healthy piglets (3–5
days old, 1.4560.05 kg weight, Sus scrofa domestica, York
breed), from three litters, were obtained from the Dalian Huaqiao
breeding swine herd. The piglets were randomly divided
into four groups: A, B, C, and D. Eleven piglets in group A,
designated as the experimental group, were pre-injected intracerebrally
with the plasmid containing AQP4 siRNA and then
exposed to ischemia and hypoxia. Eleven piglets in group B,
designated as control group 1, were pre-injected intracerebrally
with the plasmid containing scrambled siRNA and then
exposed to ischemia and hypoxia. Six piglets in group C, designated
as control group 2, were subjected to intracerebal injection
of plasmid containing scrambled siRNA and the same surgical
procedure as groups A and B but without ischemia and
hypoxia exposure. Four piglets in group D, designated as control
group 3, were not subjected to any treatment.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI was performed on animals pretreated with or without
AQP4 siRNA or scrambled siRNA before (0 h) and after ischemia
–hypoxia exposure at various time points (1, 3, 6, 9, and
12 h) under general anesthesia, using a Siemens MAGNETOM
Verio 3T imager by employing a Siemens 32-channel head coil
(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Anatomic images were
acquired using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters:
repetition time, 1,900 ms; echo time, 2.48 ms; inversion time,
900 ms; flip angle, 9; matrix, 2563 256 (interpolated to 512

3 512); and slice thickness, 1.0 mm. The final voxel size was
0.35 mm 3 0.35 mm 3 1.0 mm across the entire head from
the tip of the snout to the cervical/thoracic spinal cord junction.
Imaging comprised conventional T2-weighted sequences
and echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences. The total scanning
time was controlled within 4 min to shorten the exposure
time of piglets at a low temperature (18C). The location,
extent, and image timing of ischemic damage on conventional
and diffusion-weighted sequences and ADC maps were compared.
Images were exported in the Digital Imaging and Communications
in Medicine format and analyzed using 3D visualization
software (AMIRA; Visage Imaging, San Diego, CA).
Neurobehavioral Evaluation After Exposure
to Hypoxia–Ischemia
The neurological function in piglets was evaluated before and
at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after exposure to hypoxia–ischemia. The
neurological behaviors, including consciousness, cranial
nerves, reflection, action, and coordination, were scored by
LeBlanc’s method (23).
Immunohistochemical Analysis
Brain tissues from experimental and control piglets were fixed
in 40 g/L paraformaldehyde and paraffin wax-embedded. Subsequently
, 4-mm thick serial sections of the tissues were cut.
The sections were washed carefully with 0.01 M phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS) three times (10 min each), and then
blocked with 2% goat serum in 0.01 M PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 (PBS-X) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections
were incubated at 4C overnight with rabbit antibody against
AQP4 (1:200 dilution, Roche, Switzerland). Afterwards, the
slides were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using a
kit (Vector, USA). After visualizing the reaction with the diaminobenzidine
(DAB) chromogen, the slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin and covered with a glycerin gel. In the negative
control experiments, the primary antibodies were replaced
with PBS. Positive control samples included sections of brain tissues
known to be positive for AQP4 expression.
After staining, the tissue sections were evaluated by two
blinded, experienced investigators who provided a consensus
opinion of the staining patterns observed under light microscopy.
Five fields were randomly selected (no fewer than 200 cells were
observed under each field), and immunohistochemical staining of
the cells was assessed according to the staining intensity and the
percentage of cells stained. The staining intensity was graded
using a 4-point scale: 0, no staining; 1, light yellow; 2, brown; and
3, dark brown. The percentage of cells stained was assessed
using a semiquantitative 3-point scale: 1,<30% staining; 2, 30–
70% staining; and 3, >70% staining. The combined score (the
value of the 4-point scale plus the value of the 3-point scale) was
assessed as follows: 0–1, negative staining (-); 2–3, weak positive
staining (1); and4, positive staining (11).
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the brain tissues using a Qiagen
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNAs were prepared from 2 lg of total RNA
using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen)
and random primers. The cDNAs were then used as a template
to amplify a 410-bp fragment of AQP4 by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using SYBR Green I. The AQP4-
specific primer pair was as follows: forward, 50-TCAGCAAAG
CTAGCCAACAAAC-30; and reverse, 50-TTTCCCCTTCTTCTC
CTCACC-30. The relative amounts of AQP4 transcript were estimated
by direct comparison between multiple samples after
standardization with coamplification of a 324-bp fragment of
the house-keeping gene ACTB using the primer pair ACTB-F,
50-ggacttcgagcaggagatgg-30, and ACTB-R, 50-aggaaggagggctggaagag-30. The amplification conditions were as follows: 10
sec at 95C (one cycle); and 5 sec at 95C and 30 sec at 66.5C
(40 cycles). The results were calculated by the 22DDCt method.
Each Ct value used for these calculations was the mean of triplicate
reactions. Quantification of the target gene expression in
the samples was presented as the AQP4/ACTB ratio.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 12 statistical analysis
package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Examined data were
assessed using the t-test, general linear model, and analysis of
variance. In each test, the data were expressed as the mean6
standard deviation, and P<0.05 was accepted as statistically
significant.
Results
Establishment and Evaluation of the Brain
Hypoxia–Ischema Model
The brain hypoxia–ischema model in newborn piglets was
established by suturing the bilateral carotid arteries. MRI
scanning was performed in all groups of piglets pretreated
with or without AQP4 siRNA or scrambled siRNA before (0 h)
and after ischemia–hypoxia exposure at various time points (1,
3, 6, 9, and 12 h). The results showed that there were no statistically
significant changes in the conventional MRI signals or
the DWI images in group A (experimental group), group C
(control group 2), or group D (control group 3) at various time
points. However, in group B (control group 1), the high signal
intensity in the front lobe in the DWI image had a fuzzy boundary
at 1 h after ischemia–hypoxia exposure. At 3 h after
ischemia-hypoxia exposure, the high signal area was
expanded to the bilateral lobe and the intensity was enhanced
with a patchy distribution. Moreover, the signal area expanded
to the bilateral hippocampus and ventricule with a punctate
and patchy signal intensity and a blurred boundary. At 6 h
after ischemia–hypoxia exposure, the signal area and intensity
in the bilateral hippocampus were further expanded and
enhanced with a stripped and scattered distribution. At 12 h,
the lesion was diffused with a high signal intensity and blurred
boundary (Fig. 1A). Compared to conventional MRI, DWI obviously
is superior in the early diagnosis of hypoxic–ischemic
encephalopathy and dynamically reveals the

analyses further supported that the piglets were suffering from
hypoxia during the experiment (Fig. 1B–1D).
AQP4 Silencing Reduces Brain Edema After
Exposure to Ischemia–Hypoxia
To determine whether AQP4 silencing could provide protection
against brain injury after exposure to hypoxia-ischemia, we
used the parameter ADC, which has been shown to have better
sensitivity than conventional MRI signals. The results showed
that there were no significant changes in the ADC images in
groups A, C, and D (data not shown). However, in group B,
punctate lesions and small patches of low-density foci were
observed at 1 and 3 h after hypoxia–ischemia exposure,
respectively. The low signal lesions spread more and became
diffused at 6 and 12 h after exposure to hypoxia–ischemia
(Fig. 2A). Accordingly, the ADC values in group A did not
change much over time, but in group B they were significantly
reduced at 1 h and progressively decreased over time, reaching
the lowest level at 3 h after exposure to hypoxia-ischemia.
Interestingly, the ADC value started to recover after 6 h but
only back to two-thirds of the baseline level at 12 h (Fig. 2B–
2C). The ADC value between group B and the other three
groups was significantly different (P<0.05, Table 1)[AQ2],
while there were no significant differences among groups A, C,
and D (Table 2). Nevertheless, the ADC values at various time
points in group B were lower than those in group A, suggesting
that AQP4 silencing has a protective effect in the early
stage of brain edema.
AQP4 is Upregulated in the Brain After Exposure to
Ischemia–Hypoxia
Next, we collected hippocampal and lateral paraventricular
sections for immunohistochemical staining. The results
showed that AQP4 staining was obvious at 12 h after hypoxia–
ischemia exposure in both groups A and B. The positive cells
were visualized by the brown granular staining in the cytoplasm
(arrows). Compared to the lateral paraventricle, there
were many more positive cells in the hippocampus and the
staining was stronger with diffused expression (Fig. 3A–3D). In
both regions, the expression of AQP4 in group A was much
less than that in group B (Fig. 3B and 3D). These results demonstrated
that AQP4 was upregulated in the brain after exposure
to ischemia–hypoxia, while AQP4 siRNA significantly and
specifically inhibited AQP4 expression.

AQP4 siRNA Inhibits AQP4 mRNA Expression in the
Brain
To confirm the specificity of AQP4 siRNA, we detected the
AQP4 mRNA levels in hippocampal and lateral paraventricular
sections. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA
levels of AQP4 in the hippocampus were different between
group A and group B. The AQP4 mRNA level was significantly
lower in group A than in group B (P<0.05, Fig. 4).
In addition, the AQP4 mRNA level in the lateral paraventricle
was lower in group A than in group B, although the
difference was not significant (Fig. 4). Taken together, these
data indicate that AQP4 siRNA specifically inhibited AQP4
mRNA expression.
AQP Silencing Improves the Outcomes After
Hypoxic–Ischemic Exposure
To determine whether AQP4 silencing improves the outcomes
after exposure to hypoxia–ischemia, the neurobehaviors of piglets
before and after exposure to hypoxia–ischemia in the
experimental and control groups were evaluated by the
LeBlanc method. In group A, after hypoxia exposure for 30
min, most piglets began to present fidgeting, shortness of
breath, irregular musclar tremors, and ataxia, then gradually
fell into drowsiness. Some piglets convulsed. At 30–90 min
after the termination of hypoxia, the piglets responded to the
strong stimulus and spontaneous breathing gradually returned
to normal. However, in group B, the symptoms appeared

earlier and more serious. Only 10–15 min after exposure to
hypoxia, the piglets started to experience hyperpnoea. At
approximately 20 min, the piglets presented with skin cyanosis
and Kussmaul breathing and gradually became lethargic and
comatose, accompanied by a weak neural reflection. Until 90–
150 min after the termination of hypoxia, the animals started
to respond to the strong stimulus and began irregular spontaneous
breathing. All the piglets in this group presented with
convulsions at some point. The LeBlanc scores showed significant
differences between group A and group B at 1, 3, 6, 9,
and 12 h after exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 5). These data suggested
that the brain injury was less severe in group A than in
group B, based on the neurobehavioral functions such as consciousness
, cranial nerve, reflection, action, and coordination.
Discussion
RNAi is a highly efficient and conserved gene-silencing mechanism
, triggered by double-stranded RNA, which causes the
degradation of homologous RNA (24,25). In this study, we generated
the AQP4 gene-silencing model in neonatal pigs by
direct intracerebral injection of a plasmid containing AQP4
siRNA. These piglets were then subjected to ischemia via an
operation, followed by exposure to hypoxia. The success of
hypoxic-ischemic induction in piglets was confirmed by MRI
and DWI as well as systemic parameters such as elevated levels
of plasma LDH and PCO
2
, and the decreased level of PO
2
.
MRI is a potent means to detect neonatal brain injury and
cerebral edema. DWI and quantitative ADC values often reveal
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury at an earlier stage than conventional
MRI (6,7). It has been proposed that these quantitative
measures may have additional diagnostic value in human neonates
, especially in cases with diffuse lesions that may remain
below the threshold of visual detection (26,27). One study of 11
human neonates described the predictive value of DWI and
ADC measurements for the outcome at 24-month-old children
born asphyxiated (26). However, the predictive values of DWI
or ADC were not calculated. Furthermore, the ADC values
were considered valuable in predicting neurological outcome,
independently of all MRI findings including those of DWI (27).

In this study, we mimicked a typical incident of hypoxia and

DWI and ADC values to detect cerebral imaging
changes of acute neonatal hypoxia-ischemia in different brain

the hypoxic–ischemic piglets (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Moreover,
there was a strong correlation between the ADC value (Table
2) and the neurobehavioral outcome in both the experimental
and control groups (Fig. 5).
A previous study has shown that AQP4 mRNA expression
was significantly higher at the site of injury compared with
distant sites in the same brain, concluding that the induction
of AQP4 expression had occurred at the site of injury (28). The
correlation between the amount of AQP4 expression and the
degree of cerebral edema detected by MRI was demonstrated
in rats after hypoxia–ischemia exposure, and the tissues adjacent
to the injury had reduced AQP4 expression (16). Therefore
, the possibility of AQP4 downregulation as a protective
mechanism was proposed.
To test whether the inhibition of AQP4 expression could
exert a protective role in a setting of hypoxia-ischemia, piglets
were pretreated with AQP4 siRNA or scrambled siRNA, before
exposure to ischemia and hypoxia. The AQP4 mRNA and protein
expression levels were unaffected in the scrambled
siRNA-treated piglets compared to the untreated piglets, demonstrating
the specificity of the results and the lack of toxic
effects of the lipid formulation and the RNA duplexes. In contrast
, AQP4 knockdown in the brain of neonatal piglets showed
a remarkable alteration in DWI as well as ADC imaging, which
could serve as indicators of brain edema (29). Moreover, the
correlation between the degree of cerebral edema and the
amount of AQP4 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels
was demonstrated after exposure to hypoxia–ischemia in
the hippocampus. The piglets with AQP4 inhibition also
showed a lesser degree of encephalopathy at the time when
the control piglets were comatose. In addition, the upregulation
of AQP4 levels correlated with the degree of brain edema
and encephalopathy in the control group subjected to hypoxia–
ischemia. However, such a correlation was not observed in the
lateral paraventricle, suggesting that the tolerance or sensitivity
of brain tissues in different locations to hypoxia may be different.
Further studies are needed to explore the underlying
mechanism.
Taken together, our data suggest that AQP4 plays an
important role in mediating brain edema in hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy. AQP4 could be a therapeutic target to ameliorate
brain edema caused by many disorders.
