Differential gene expression in multiple neurological, inflammatory and connective tissue
pathways in a spontaneous model of human small vessel stroke
Aims: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes a fifth of
all strokes plus diffuse brain damage leading to cognitive
decline, physical disabilities and dementia. The aetiology
and pathogenesis of SVD are unknown, but largely attributed
to hypertension or microatheroma. Methods: We
used the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat
(SHRSP), the closest spontaneous experimental model
of human SVD, and age-matched control rats kept
under identical, non-salt-loaded conditions, to perform a
blinded analysis of mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR and
pathway analysis in two brain regions (frontal and midcoronal
) commonly affected by SVD in the SHRSP at age
five, 16 and 21 weeks. Results: We found gene expression
abnormalities, with fold changes ranging from 2.5 to 59
for the 10 most differentially expressed genes, related
to endothelial tight junctions (reduced), nitric oxide
bioavailability (reduced), myelination (impaired), glial
and microglial activity (increased), matrix proteins
(impaired), vascular reactivity (impaired) and albumin
(reduced), consistent with protein expression defects in
the same rats. All were present at age 5 weeks thus
predating blood pressure elevation. ‘Neurological’ and
‘inflammatory’ pathways were more affected than
‘vascular’ functional pathways. Conclusions: This set of
defects, although individually modest, when acting in
combination could explain the SHRSP’s susceptibility to
microvascular and brain injury, compared with control
rats. Similar combined, individually modest, but multiple
neurovascular unit defects, could explain susceptibility to
spontaneous human SVD.

Introduction
Stroke is the second commonest cause of death and commonest
cause of dependence in adults worldwide. A fifth of
all strokes, a quarter of all ischaemic strokes, are lacunar
in type and part of the spectrum of cerebral small vessel

disease (SVD) [1]. SVD also causes cognitive and physical
disabilities [2], doubles the risk of dementia and trebles the
risk of stroke [3].
Cerebral SVD affects the penetrating arterioles supplying
the cerebral white and deep grey matter [1]. Human
pathology, often late stage and thus hard to unravel
[4], includes arteriolar vessel wall thickening, perivascular
inflammation, arteriolar wall disintegration
[5] and perivascular damage particularly oedema and
demyelination [6] commonly considered to be a consequence
of ischaemia [4]. Hypertension is the main
known vascular risk factor for SVD [7]. However, some
individuals with pathological evidence of SVD lacked evidence
of having been hypertensive in life [8], and trials of
antihypertensive drugs have had mixed success in preventing
SVD progression [9–11].
We considered that examination of different potential
SVD mechanisms in experimental models might provide
insight into pathogenesis of human SVD. Although several
models exist we focused on the spontaneously hypertensive
stroke-prone rat (SHRSP), which is genetically stable and
known to mimic spontaneously the human microvascular
and brain tissue changes [12,13]. The SHRSP was bred
from the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) via the spontaneously
hypertensive rat (SHR) [14]. It starts to develop hypertension
after 6 weeks of age and strokes begin to occur from
around 20 weeks [12]. It develops lipohyalinosis and fibrinoid
necrosis, small deep infarcts, haemorrhages, white
matter abnormalities and perivascular space enlargement
spontaneously that resemble the pathological changes
associated with human SVD [12,14]. Although traditionally
attributed to hypertension, we found differences in
protein expression in SHRSPs (vs. age-matched WKY controls
) at only 5 weeks of age, that is before blood pressure
rises, which persist at 16 and 21 weeks of age [15]. These
endothelial, glial, astrocyte, microglial and matrix protein
abnormalities provide a potential mechanism to explain
the SHRSP’s vulnerability to cerebral microvascular and
parenchymal damage [15].
Components of human SVD are highly heritable, but
so far human genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified few genes associated with white matter
hyperintensities (mostly of unknown function) and none
so far for lacunar stroke [16–18]. The genetic factors
that render the SHRSP stroke-prone are also poorly
understood. Known differences between SHRSP and
WKY include STR-2 quantitative trait loci on chromosome
5 colocalized with genes encoding atrial and brain
natriuretic peptides [19–21], a single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) on chromosome 2 (R202H) associated
with reduced glutathione S-transferase expression [22],
and, from a recent GWAS, a number of candidate genes
for hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rat
substrains [23], but which are not known to affect stroke
directly [24].
We hypothesized that the predisposition of SHRSP to
cerebral microvascular and brain tissue pathology is
multifactorial, involves several pathways, with no single
genetic defect accounting for all the structural and pathological
changes. We assessed mRNA expression in the brain
by microarray, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and pathway analysis in
SHRSP and WKY fed a normal diet at 5, 16 and 21 weeks in
the two brain regions (frontal and mid-coronal), which are
known to express maximal pathology [15].
Materials and methods
Animals and tissue
All animals were kept and experiments conducted according
to UK regulations for live animal research in licensed
laboratories (licence No. 60/3618) and conducted according
to the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In
Vivo Experiments) guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org/
ARRIVE). We also report our results according to the
Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment
(MIAME) 2.0 criteria (http://www.mged.org/
Workgroups/MIAME/miame_2.0.html).
SHRSP rats were considered the most appropriate
model of human SVD available based on a detailed
systematic review undertaken within the lab [12]. It is
accepted that no animal model will ever truly and completely
represent a human disease, but the data generated
from a carefully chosen model can inform and focus subsequent
translational research.
We used four male SHRSP
Gla
(designated SHRSP) and
WKY
Gla
(designated WKY) animals in each of three age
groups (5, 16 and 21 weeks, total animals n = 24) from
the Glasgow colony, the same animals having been used to
generate earlier immunohistochemistry data, thereby
providing a direct intra-animal immunohistochemistrymRNA
comparison. Five-week-old animals were considered
prehypertensive as SHRSP have consistently not
shown any difference in blood pressure (BP) until after 6
weeks in SHRSP from this colony in prior work compared

with control rats [25], with BP measurements always
taken from conscious animals. We considered 15-weekold
rats to represent established hypertension, and 21
weeks as an age at which strokes were commonly seen to
start. We kept all animals in identical conditions and fed
both strains on standard rat chow ad libitum (Rat and
Mouse No. 1 Maintenance Diet, Special Diet Services). We
used tail cuff plethysmography to take measurements of
systolic blood pressure on a weekly basis in older rats. We
sacrificed animals by overdose of isofluorane anaesthetic
plus exsanguination. We preserved one cerebral hemisphere
in formalin and the other hemisphere in liquid
nitrogen for mRNA analysis as previously described [15].
For mRNA analysis, we immersed each frozen hemisphere
in ×10 volume of RNA-later ice solution and incubated for
24 h at −20°C so that the following day 2 mm coronal
slices from a frontal and a mid-coronal region could be
taken using a Zivic® rat slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA) which captured the frontal cortex,
thalamus, internal capsule and basal ganglia. These represent
the areas most susceptible to cerebral and vascular
pathology in the SHRSP [12].
RNA extraction
We placed each coronal slice in approximately 1.5 ml
(×10 volume) of lysis buffer (Qiazol) and homogenized the
tissue using a POLYTRON® homogenizer (Capitol Scientific
Inc., Austin, TX, USA). We extracted RNA using a
Qiagen RNAeasy lipid tissue minikit (Qiagen Ltd., Manchester
, UK). We eluted the resulting RNA with nuclease
free water (2 × 50 μl). We treated half the elute with turbo
DNase to remove any remaining genomic DNA and
assessed the quality of the resulting RNA on a Nanodrop
1000 and Agilent® bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA, USA).
RNA amplification and purification
We performed transcriptions from RNA to cRNA using an
Ambion® Illumina® Total Prep RNA amplification kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). We generated
first-strand cDNA with a first-strand master mix containing
an oligo (dT) tagged with a phage T7 promotor and
second-strand cDNA with a master mix containing DNA
polymerase. We added the in vitro master mix solution to
the elute according to kit instructions to amplify and label
the cDNA with biotin UTP. We obtained a final cRNA elute
of ∼200 μl and checked cRNA quality on the Agilent®
bioanalyser.
Microarray mRNA expression analysis
We added 5 μlof cRNA(∼750 ng) to 10 μl of hybridization
buffer and loaded the resulting 15 μl onto a RatRef12
microarray chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), containing
22 519 gene and probe sets. We incubated chips at
58°C overnight, washed them with E1BC solution and
stained them in a solution of E1 buffer plus 1:1000 dilution
of streptavidin-Cy3. We scanned chips on an Illumina®
Bead Reader (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and recorded
the intensity of fluorescent signal emitted. Samples with a
signal intensity of >600 passed the bead array reader’s
quality control. We randomized samples throughout the
entire microarray protocol and all samples were hybridized
to the chips and scanned at the same time.
qRT-PCR
Using the same DNase-treated RNA from the microarray
experiment as the template for the synthesis of cDNA, we
performed qRT-PCR reactions using Applied Biosystems
Taqman® Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) to quantitatively confirm differential
expression measured in the microarray experiment.
Briefly, we reverse transcribed 20 μl reactions on a 96-
well plate containing approximately 1 μg of RNA using
the Taqman® reverse transcription master mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) including OligodT
primers and Multiscribe™ reverse transcriptase enzyme.
We performed qRT-PCR on the cDNA by creating a reaction
mix in the same Eppendorf containingTaqman® universal
master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) plus
a probe for a housekeeping (control) gene [Glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (VIC® labelled)]
and the Taqman® probe corresponding to our gene of
interest (FAM® labelled). We ran samples on a 384-well
plate on a 7900HT Sequence detector (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA).
Standard PCR
We designed forward and reverse primers corresponding
to the portion of the GUCY1a3 gene sequence covered by
the Illumina® microarray probe. To test for insertions or

deletions within the sequence between strains we ran endpoint
PCR using these primers, on DNA taken from the
livers of additional SHRSP (n = 4) and WKY (n = 3). We
used ‘Kod Hot Start’ DNA polymerase (Novagen, Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) and performed PCR reactions using
the designated kit and to manufacturer’s instructions.
Extension times depended on the length of sequence being
created. We performed all PCR reactions on a MJ Research
Peltier Thermal Cycler (http://www.mj-research.com)
using 96-well plates. We analysed results using agarose
gel electrophoresis. We visualized gels on a Bio-Rad
Fluor-S Multimager and assessed the size of PCR products
using Promega 100 bp or 1 kb DNA ladders (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA).
DNA sequencing
We used Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator n3.1
Cycle Sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) for all sequencing reactions and performed reactions
in 96-well plates (SHRSP n = 2, WKY n = 3 taken
from the samples used for standard PCR). We loaded a
reaction solution of sequencing buffer, ready reaction,
primer, purified PCR product and water into each well. To
sequence, we used a temperature cycling programme of
96°C for 45 s, 50°C for 25 s and 60°C for 4 min, repeated
25 times. We performed sequencing capillary electrophoresis
on a 48-capillary Applied Biosystems 3730 Genetic
Analyser with 36 cm capillaries filled with POP-7 polymer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and warmed to
60°C. We separated sequencing products by size using
electrophoresis set to 8500 V for 50 min.
Data analysis
Microarray data We analysed data using Rank Products
(RP) analysis, a nonparametric statistical technique [26]
complete with Bejamini-Hochberg false discovery rate
(FDR) adjustment for multiple testing. FDR < 0.05 was
considered significant. We did not set a minimum individual
fold change for significance as we were interested in
pathway interactions. We first generated Venn diagrams
to visualize the results by age and brain section, then
uploaded focus genes onto the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
® (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com)
and analysed data using both a prespecified candidate gene
approach (looking for changes in genes and pathways
thought to be relevant from previous work by ourselves and
others) and a genome-wide approach (to generate new
hypotheses). Significance of pathways was assessed using
one-sided Fisher’s exact tests.
qRT-PCR data we exported cycle threshold (CT) values
from sequence detection system (SDS) software into a
Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet and compared the mean
delta cycle threshold (dCT) values vs. the housekeeper
gene (Student’s t-test). From these values, we calculated
and plotted the delta dCT (ddCT) and relative quantification
of mRNA expression changes (2∧ddCT) values.
Sequencing data We analysed sequencing using Applied
Biosystems SeqScape® software and aligned experimental
sequences with known sequences derived from
bioinformatic databases such as ENSEMBL genome
browser (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html).
Results
At 5 weeks (prior to any rise in blood pressure), there were
more differentially expressed genes between SHRSP and
WKY than at 16 or 21 weeks: 162 were differentially
expressed in both brain regions, plus 202 just in frontal
and 88 just in mid-coronal sections (total 452). There
were far fewer differentially expressed genes at 16 weeks
(71 genes in both regions, 30 in frontal only, 20 in
mid-coronal only, total 121) or 21 weeks (63 genes in
both regions, 131 in frontal only, 47 in mid-coronal only,
total 241).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of all 452 differentially
expressed genes at 5 weeks showed that these involved
several functional pathways (Table 1), many of which
remained affected at 16 and 21 weeks (Table 2). A
common feature in both brain regions was the striking
over-representation of genes for ‘neurological disease’
(Figure 1) particularly those involved in encephalopathy,
stroke, depression and blood brain barrier leakage (Table 3;
further details in Tables S1 and S2).
Network analysis of the differential gene expression
showed significant up-regulation in SHRSP of transcription
factors (Figure 2) including Fos, JunB, Btg2 and early
growth response genes (Egr1, Egr2, Egr4), genes central to
cell signalling (Pgs2 [Cox2], Nfkbia, Pten, Sgk1), and C3;
others were down-regulated (e.g. insulin-like growth
factors [Igf2], albumin [Alb], Gfap and Mmp14).
Across all ages, biological pathway analysis using IPA
showed that the most significantly differentially expressed

genes were in the acute phase response signalling pathway,
but other pathways including circadian rhythm and complement
were also affected (Figure 3). In the acute phase
pathway, complement factor 3 (C3) was up-regulated,
while Alb and transcription factor 4 were down-regulated.
All three components of the complement pathway (classic,
lectin and alternate) were affected (C3 up-regulated, C2
and C4 down-regulated) (Figure 4). The top five affected
pathways also included genes associated with tight junction
structure and signalling in 16- and 21-week-old
SHRSP.
Among the most highly up-regulated genes were
(Table 4): rat genome database (RGD) gene 1564649
related to urinary albumin secretion (up ∼48-fold); ribosomal
protein S9 (Rps9) a translation regulator involved
in cell proliferation (up ∼26-fold); and guanylate cyclase
soluble subunit alpha-3 (Gucy1a3,up∼20-fold), the intracellular
nitric oxide (NO) vascular smooth muscle receptor.
Among the most down-regulated genes were: Alb (down
approximately threefold at all ages); arginine vasopressin
(Avp, down fourfold at 5 weeks); guanine nucleotidebinding
protein alpha inhibiting 1 (Gnai1, down threefold
at 16 weeks); and oxytocin (down approximately threefold
at 21 weeks).
Compared with previously observed protein immunoreactivity
[15], we saw no differences in mRNA
expression of claudin-5, collagen I or Iba-1. However,
Mmp14 mRNA was down-regulated in SHRSP at 5 weeks
and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) has been
shown to have a key role in modulating vessel stability
and vascular responses to tissue injury by interacting
with vascular molecules [27]. Down-regulated Mbp
mRNA expression (2.6-fold) at 21 weeks was consistent
with previously observed reduced myelin basic protein
(MBP) immunoreactivity at all ages [15]. No relevant
immunohistochemistry antibody was available to test
for differential protein expression of AVP or GUCY1a3,
but the mRNA data were consistent with other results
[20–22].
qRT-PCR (Table S3) confirmed the microarray data for:
MMP14 (down fivefold at 5 weeks, P < 0.01); GFAP (down
twofold at 5 weeks, P = 0.01); and AVP (down fourfold at 5
weeks, P < 0.001) (Figure 5). qRT-PCR did not confirm
the Alb, Gucy1a3, Mbp or Gpr98 findings. The Alb difference
may be a ‘floor effect’ where low mRNA expression,
detectable by the greater dynamic range of the mRNA
microarray, was undetectable by qRT-PCR. Despite consistent >15-fold Gucy1a3 mRNA up-regulation in SHRSP
at all ages in both brain sections, qRT-PCR showed no
significant differences. Microarray and qRT-PCR probes
examine different gene segments which are separated by
>1000 nucleotides. Whole gene sequencing demonstrated

a SNP in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the Gucy1a3
gene at position 4379 (WKY cytosine, SHRSP thymine).
Discrepancies between mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry could be further explained either
by a true functional difference caused by microRNA
binding to the 3′UTR region [28], or by post-translational
modification [29]. Post-translational modification may
be a result of over-exposure to a neurotransmitter or
increased levels of reactive oxygen species [30] known to
be present in the SHRSP [22].
Discussion
Differential gene expression between SHRSP and WKY has
been demonstrated, the top 10 differentially expressed
genes having fold changes >2.5, and passing a FDR of
P < 0.05. These differences were most pronounced at 5
weeks and diminished with age. The fact that the greatest
difference in gene expression was seen in the youngest
prehypertensive age group supports the hypothesis
that there are genetic factors unrelated to primary

hypertension that underlie susceptibility to damage to the
neurovascular unit, and that some of these genes have
reduced expression with ageing. It is possible that some of
these pathways are related to age-specific processes such
as developmental growth, although further genome
analysis is required to assess this.
We demonstrate multiple transcription regulation differences
across several key functional and biological
pathways around the neurovascular unit that explain
some of the SHRSP’s complex brain pathology. The
major biological pathways affected were ‘neurological’
and ‘inflammatory’. The most affected genes were generally
conserved across all three ages examined. This constellation
of differentially expressed genes may together
increase vulnerability to microvascular damage and
stroke. Possible mechanisms which may be involved,
suggested by the data from this study and immunohistochemistry
[15], include: impaired endothelial integrity
(reduced claudin 5, MMP14) increasing the vascular
endothelial permeability to plasma components which
damage the arteriolar wall and subsequently the
perivascular brain; reduced albumin facilitates fluid exudation
into the vessel wall and brain interstitium
through impaired plasma osmotic pressure [31];
microglial inflammatory responses are heightened,
reducing NO bioavailability due to increased NO degradation
from superoxide species [22,32–34]; myelination
(decreased MBP) is impaired and gliosis (increased
GFAP) is increased, worsening brain damage; impaired
vasoregulation (decreased Avp and Gnai1) and possibly
reduced NO bioavailability (functional increase in NO
receptor Gucy1a3) further increase vulnerability to
ischaemia through impaired cerebral vasodilatation.
Up-regulated inflammatory pathway genes indicate a
chronically challenged immune system from early life
also shown by others [12] which may trigger or accentuate
the vascular and perivascular damage observed
in older SHRSP compared with control strains. Several
of the genes showing significant differential expression
between SHRSP and WKY were downstream transcriptional
targets of cAMP response element-binding protein
(CREB) particularly the transcription factors (Figure 6).
Genes regulated by CREB have been implicated in vascular
remodelling in salt-induced hypertensive disease [35].
We found no difference in mRNA expression of Creb1,
but differential phosphorylation of Creb1, initiated by NO
[36] could be the source of increased transcription factor
expression, and if shown in future experiments, would
provide further evidence of a central role for altered
intracellular NO signalling.
Reduced Avp is consistent with reported abnormalities
in STR-2 loci [19] and associated with time to first stroke
in SHRSP [20], highlighting the importance of intact
vasoregulation. Potential functional differences in
Gucy1a3 are consistent with observed increases in
endothelin 1A receptors [34] and lower bioavailability of
NO in SHRSP due to increased NO degradation from
superoxide species [22,32,33]. Gucy1a3 was also identified
in a recent GWAS of blood pressure and cardiovascular
disease risk in humans [37].

The tight junction pathway defects concur with data
from older SHRSP [38]. The strikingly and consistently
abnormal acute phase response pathways concur with
reports of proteinuria and raised serum inflammatory
proteins prior to hypertension [39], although salt supplementation
confounded these studies [12]. Increased complement
and other inflammatory gene expression parallels
the consistent observation of perivascular inflammation
seen pathologically in humans for over a century [4]. Tenmonth-old
stroke-free SHRSP had elevated MBP in one
study of rats from the same colony [40] in contrast to the
present work. The rats in both studies were fed on the same
diet and kept in identical conditions, so the different findings
cannot be attributed to salt loading as in some earlier
studies. The rats studied by Brittain et al. [40] at 10 months
were the minority of stroke-free survivors as about 70% of
the Glasgow SHRSP colony have had stroke by 9 months
and died. As our rats were sacrificed young, we have no way
of knowing if they were in the 70% that have stroke by 9
months or not. Of note, we did find histological evidence of
early arteriolar fibrinoid microvascular changes in one
SHRSP used in the gene expression analysis (EL Bailey and
C Smith, unpub. obs.) in contrast to Brittain et al.
Although in this study we had limited numbers of rats,
we had control animals kept under identical conditions,
carefully blinded all analyses, had immunohistochemistry
from the same rats’ opposite hemispheres, and used multiple
overlapping methods to check our findings.

We consider this SHRSP rat data to be valid animal
model data to help focus translation research. In
humans, stroke is a complex multifactorial disease,
making a complex spontaneous disease model highly
relevant. A large meta-analysis of stroke GWAS data
by METASTROKE has emphasized the need for specific
stroke subtyping and has strongly suggested that different
pathogenic mechanisms underlie the different stroke
subtypes [18]. The genetic architecture of most human
cerebral small vessel stroke is unknown, hampered by
imprecise stroke phenotyping and multiple accumulating
ageing-related comorbidities. Brain microarray studies in
elderly patients with dementia show multiple vessel wall,
endothelial and brain parenchymal abnormalities including
endothelial leakage [41] but precipitating factors
and underlying susceptibility are difficult to unravel from
end-stage disease. Human GWAS support the multifactorial
nature of SVD [17]. Blood–brain barrier permeability
is increased early in disease development in SHRSP [42],
and is a key feature associated with human SVD in

several primary studies [1]. Abnormal vasoregulation,
long suspected in human SVD and associated with time
to first stroke in SHRSP [19] could be the final factor that
precipitates SVD brain lesions once the multifactorial
milieu described above is established. Human data from
the Leiden Longevity Study suggests that individuals who
survive into late old age (equivalent to 10 months in
SHRSP) are less susceptible to white matter damage
and lacunar infarcts [43] and we would be interested to
study older (10 months) stroke-free SHRSP rats to assess
myelin integrity.
In summary, our data supports the multifactorial
theory of SVD, with a number of genetic predispositions
and biological pathways potentially contributing to the
typical pathology. A similar targeted approach using new
single cell mRNA technologies should be considered to
