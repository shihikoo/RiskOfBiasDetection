Abstract
Background: The plasma protein hemopexin (HPX) exhibits the highest binding affinity to free heme. In vitro
experiments and gene-knock out technique have suggested that HPX may have a neuroprotective effect. However,
the expression of HPX in the brain was not well elucidated and its expression after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
injury was also poorly studied. Furthermore, no in vivo data were available on the effect of HPX given centrally on
the prognosis of focal cerebral ischemia.
Results: In the present study, we systematically investigated expression of HPX in normal rat brain by
immunofluorescent staining. The results showed that HPX was mainly expressed in vascular system and neurons,
as well as in a small portion of astrocytes adjacent to the vessels in normal rat brain. Further, we determined the
role of HPX in the process of focal cerebral ischemic injury and explored the effects of HPX treatment in a rat
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. After 2 h’ middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h’
reperfusion, the expression of HPX was increased in the neurons and astrocytes in the penumbra area, as
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques. Intracerebroventricular injection of HPX at
the onset of reperfusion dose-dependently reduced the infarct volumes and improved measurements of
neurological function of the rat subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of HPX
sustained for up to 7 days after experiments.
Conclusions: Our study provides a new insight into the potential neuroprotective role of HPX as a contributing
factor of endogenous protective mechanisms against focal cerebral ischemia injury, and HPX might be developed
as a potential agent for treatment of ischemic stroke.

Background
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide
and the second leading cause of long-term disability in
developed countries. Demographic data has shown that
800,000 individuals suffered from stroke each year in the
United States, among which, approximately 150,000 died
[1]. In China, the figures were even more striking. About
1.5 to 2 million new strokes occurred each year in
China, among which more than 1 million died [2]. A
number of therapeutic strategies have been developed
for treating stroke over the past several decades, such as
hypothermia, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and ischemic
preconditioning. However, when one considers
the narrow therapeutic window, the limited clinical efficacy
, and the inevitable side effects associated with such
therapeutic tools, the outcomes are far from satisfactory.
For this reason, it is necessary to explore new strategies for
the clinical management of this potentially fatal disease.
Studies have shown that many mechanisms are associated
with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, including
excitotoxicity, brain edema, and neuronal apoptosis [3,4].
Additionally, free heme is released from methemoglobin
after an occurrence of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and
as such, represents a toxic component in the peripheral
blood [5].

Hemopexin (HPX) is a 60 kDa serum glycoprotein with
the greatest binding affinity (K
d
<1pM ) to heme [6]. Many
types of cells synthesize HPX including hepatic parenchymal
cells, ganglionic and photoreceptor cells of the retina,
kidney mesangial cells, and cells in the peripheral nervous
system [7,8]. HPX behaves as an efficient scavenger of
heme in overloaded peripheral blood [5,9]. Surprisingly,
HPX was reported to be locally expressed in the central
nervous system (CNS) [7,10], but reports on its cellular
localization in CNS are contradictory and the temporal
changes of its expression after cerebral ischemia has not
be observed. In addition, prior work found that HPX-null
mice sustained greater infarct volumes and behavioral
deficits than their wild-type counterparts in a model of
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, indicating its
neuroprotective role against stroke-related damage [10].
However, it remained unclear whether administration of
exogenous HPX can improve the outcome of cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury.
In the present study, we designed experiments to
determine the cellular location and expression level
changes of HPX after focal ischemia and reperfusion
injury, and subsequently explore the therapeutic effect
of HPX using a rat model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO).
Methods
Animals
The experimental procedures in this study were approved by
the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the
Fourth Military Medical University, China. Male Sprague–
Dawley (SD) rats, with a weight of approximately 280–320 g,
were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the
Fourth Military Medical University. Animals were housed
under environmental controlled conditions, with a 12-hour
light/dark cycle, an ambient temperature of 24 ± 2°C and free
access to food and water. We made efforts to minimize the
number of animals used and their suffering.
Experiment design
Experiment I
The objective of this experiment was to examine localization
of hemopexin in normal rat brain and to explore
its protein level changes in the ischemic penumbra
following ischemia-reperfusion. The rats were randomly
assigned to the group subjected to middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) or a sham group. Rats in the MCAO
group experienced ischemia for 2 h. Next, at 2 h, 6 h,
12 h and 24 h after reperfusion (n=4 rats per group at
each time point), the frequency of HPX positive cells in
brain sections and the levels of HPX protein in brain
homogenates were assessed by immunohistochemistry
and Western immunoblotting, respectively.
Experiment II
The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the
neuroprotective effects of varying doses of HPX on
transient focal cerebral ischemia following intracerebroventricular
injection. In this experiment, 50 rats were randomly
assigned to 5 groups: control group; vehicle group
(intracerebroventricularly injected with 0.1% sodium
azide); and dose-dependently delivered HPX injection
groups, in which rats received an intracerebroventricular
injection of HPX at the following doses: 0.46 mg/ml (low
dose), 0.93 mg/ml (middle dose) and 1.86 mg/ml (high
dose). Animals were dose-dependently exposed to 5 μlof
rat hemopexin reference serum (ICL, Portland, OR, USA)
or the carrier vehicle (5 μl, 0.1% sodium azide) at the beginning
of reperfusion using a single intracerebroventricular
injection following a previously published protocol
[11]. Immediately prior to injection, HPX was dissolved in
0.1% sodium azide and diluted to a final concentration in
normal saline.
Experiment III
The objective of this experiment was to assess the longterm
therapeutic effects of HPX in the setting of transient
focal cerebral ischemia. In this experiment, 16 rats were
randomly selected into a group receiving the carrier vehicle
alone, or a group receiving the test agent HPX (n=8
rats per group). All animals were subjected to MCAO.
Both HPX (1.86 mg/ml, 5 μl) and the carrier vehicle (0.1%
sodium azide, 5 μl) were administered to the animals by
the intracerebroventricular route as soon as the reperfusion
procedure had been initiated. A qualified observer,
who was blind to the grouping information, evaluated the
neurological behavior of the rats daily. These evaluations
were measured after MCAO until day seven after administration
of HPX, and done according to an 18-point
scoring system [12]. Following decapitation of the rats, the
brain infarct volumes were assessed.
Western immunoblot analysis
Rats (n = 4 per group, per time-point) were deeply anesthetized
before decapitated, and brain tissues quickly removed
from the ipsilateral peri-ischemic cortex (ischemic penumbra
) in alignment with the corresponding time-points after
ischemia-reperfusion and frozen for subsequent tissue
homogenization. Protein extracts were obtained by grinding
tissue in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. An
equal amount of protein (40 μg) was loaded into each lane
of a polyacrylamide-SDS gel, subjected to electrophoresis
and resolved proteins transferred to a PVDF membrane.
Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA and incubated with
the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The
primary antibodies used in this procedure were; anti-HPX
(1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and an anti-rabbit β-actin antibody

(1:1000 dilution, CWBIO, Peking, China), which was used
as an internal protein loading control. The membranes
were washed three times in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline
Tween-20) for 5 min per each, then incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with the appropriate goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution, CWBIO, Peking,
China). To visualize specific protein bands, the immunoblots
were immersed in enhanced chemiluminescent
(ECL) reagent, followed by exposure to ECL- Hyperfilm
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Immunofluorescence staining
Animals were first anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
administration of 40 mg kg− 1 pentobarbital sodium,
then transcardially perfused with saline followed immediately
by 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently the brains were removed
and immersed in 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) overnight at 4°C. Brains were then transferred
to a 30% sucrose solution for 24 h. Corneal slices were
prepared as 12 um sections using a standard cryostat,
and stored at −20°C. Sections were blocked in 10% normal
goat serum supplemented with 0.3% Triton X-100
for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were next incubated
with a combination of primary anti-mouse glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, at a dilution of 1:500;
Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) and a primary rabbit
polyclonal antibody directed against HPX (at a dilution
of 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Sections were next washed
three times in PBS, then incubated in NeuroTrace (at a
dilution of 1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)
or with two secondary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature. Secondary antibodies were: donkey antimouse
conjugated to green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488
(at a concentration of 1:500; Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA) and donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to
red-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594 (at a dilution of 1:500;
Vector Laboratories). Sections were incubated with
DAPI (1 ng/μl; Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) to stain the
nuclei for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescent signals
were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy
(Olympus, FV1000).
Focal cerebral ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by MCAO
using an intraluminal filament technique, as previously
described [13,14]. Briefly, rats were fasted for 12 h prior to
surgery but were allowed free access to water. Anesthesia
was induced by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital
sodium (40 mg/kg in normal saline). Next, the right common
carotid artery (CCA) and the right external carotid
artery (ECA) were exposed through a ventral midline neck
incision, and were ligated proximally. A 4/0 monofilament
nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd.) was
inserted through an arteriectomy in the common carotid
artery just below the carotid bifurcation and into the internal
carotid artery approximately 18–20 mm distal to
the carotid bifurcation until mild resistance was felt [15].
Next, the middle cerebral artery was occluded. After 2 h
of ischemia, the reperfusion process was accomplished by
withdrawing the suture then reapplying the suture to the
wound. During this process cerebral blood flow was monitored
through a disposable fiber optic probe (with a diameter
of 0.5 mm) connected to a laser Doppler unit
(PeriFlux 5000, Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Rats
that showed more than a 70% reduction in cerebral blood
flow were retained in their corresponding groups for data
recording (Figure 1). Body temperature of the rats was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C during the procedure.
Intracerebroventricular injection
Anesthetized rats were placed on a stereotaxic apparatus
and four stainless-steel screws were secured to the skull
and occluded. An incision to the scalp exposed the surface
of the skull and bregma. A burr hole was drilled
into the bone of the right hemisphere with a stainless
steel 26-gauge cannula, located 1.5 mm lateral to, and
0.8 mm posterior to the bregma. A 5 μl Hamilton syringe
was introduced slowly to 3.5 mm beneath the dural
surface to allow dose dependent exposure of rats to 5 μl
of rat hemopexin reference serum HPX (ICL, Portland,
OR) or vehicle (0.1% sodium azide) by injection. The injection
needle was maintained in situ for 5 min before
withdrawal.
Neurobehavioral evaluation and assessment of infarct
At 24 h (or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7d) after reperfusion, the
neurologic behavior of the rats was determined by a
qualified observer blinded to the rat grouping strategy,
and according to a previously described 18-point scoring
system [12]. Rats were anesthetized, decapitated, and the
brains were removed, sliced into six separate 2 mm thick
coronal sections and stained with a 2% solution of 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) at 37°C for 10 min [13,14]. The slices were then
fixed in 4% formalin prior to digital photographic images
being recorded (Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Unstained areas
were defined as infarcts and were measured by image
analysis software (Adobe Photoshop, Version CS3). To
exclude the effect of ischemia-induced cerebral edema
on the infarct size, the percent of the infarct volume was
calculated indirectly according to the formula: ([total
contralateral hemispheric volume] - [total ipsilateral
hemispheric stained volume]) / (total contralateral hemispheric
volume) × 100.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were made using the SPSS 14.0 data
analysis software program. All values, with the exception
of the neurologic scores, were described as mean ± SEM,
and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Differences between two groups were detected
by applying Tukey’s post-hoc test. The neurological scores
were described as the median (interquartile range), and
these data sets were compared by applying the Kruskal-
Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney U-test and
Bonferroni’s post-hoc correction. Statistical significance
was defined as attaining at least a value of P< 0.05.
Results
Cellular location of HPX in the normal rat brain
Our immunofluorescence staining results demonstrated
that the HPX protein was strongly expressed in the cerebral
vascular system, especially in the ependymal epithelial
cells and choroid plexus cells (Figure 2A-D). In brain parenchyma
, HPX immunoreactivities were mainly localized

in neurons, predominantly in the hippocampal pyramidal
cells, and cerebellar Purkinje cells, as demonstrated by
doubling staining of HPX and NeuN, a neuronal marker
(Figure 2E-L). The majorities of astrocytes were not
stained by HPX except those in the periphery of ventricular
system and blood vessels, as shown by doubling staining
with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for
astrocytes (Figure 2A-D; Figure 3E-H).
Alteration of HPX expression following cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion
Following transient MCAO, the protein levels of HPX
were gradually increased in ipsilateral ischemic penumbra,
as detected by Western immunoblotting. By 24 h after reperfusion
, HPX protein levels in the ischemia-reperfusion
(I/R) group increased markedly in comparison to the
sham group (P<0.05, Figure 4A). Consistent with the
Western immunoblotting findings, the number of HPX
positive cells visualized by immunohistochemical staining
in the vicinity of ischemic penumbra of the I/R group
were notably increased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus
, and striatum (Figure 4B, 4C and 4D).
Effects of intracerebroventricular injection of HPX on
MCAO injuries
Intracerebroventricular administration of different doses of
HPX (high dose: 1.86 mg/ml; medium dose: 0.93 mg/ml;
low dose: 0.46 mg/ml) improved neurological deficit (A)
and infarct volume percentages (B) in a dose-dependent
manner by 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion. The neurobehavioral
outcome of the high-dose HPX (1.86 mg/ml)
administered group was markedly improved as compared
with the control and vehicle-given groups (P<0.01 for
both comparisons, Figure 5A) at 24 h post-reperfusion.
Medium-dose HPX (0.93 mg/ml) also induced an
improved neurobehavioral outcome as compared with the
vehicle group (P<0.05, Figure 5A). Intracerebroventricular
injection of high-dose (1.86 mg/ml) and medium-dose
(0.93 mg/ml) HPX also reduced the infarct size in the brain
at 24 h post-reperfusion (Figure 5B). Further, the brain infarct
volume percent in the high-dose HPX group was also
lower than that seen in the medium-dose group (P<0.05,
Figure 5B). In view of the best neuroprotective effect, we
selected the high-dose concentration of HPX (1.86 mg/ml)
as the dose used in the following studies.
Long-term therapeutic effects of HPX on transient focal
cerebral ischemia
The long-term beneficial effects of treatment with highdose
HPX were verified according to the neurobehavioral
and infarct volume data within 7d following MCAO
(Figure 6). Neurologic behavioral scores were recorded
daily after MCAO until day 7 when animals were decapitated
, and the percent of brain volumes were determined.
Neurological behavior scores in the HPX group were
markedly greater than the vehicle group in each corresponding
day (P<0.01, Figure 6A). In addition, brain
infarct sizes were significantly reduced in the HPX group
on the 7th day after MCAO (P<0.01, Figure 6B), which
was consistent with the data of behavioral observations.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to test the HPX expression in
normal brain tissue and to determine the role of HPX
during focal cerebral ischemia injury. We found that
HPX positively expressed in several brain regions under
physiological conditions, and the protein level of HPX
was up-regulated at 24 h after middle cerebral artery
occlusion. Further, intracerebroventricular administration
of HPX in vivo dose-dependently decreased the

astrocytes were mainly located near the blood vessels (E-H). Scale bars = 40 μm.

at 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion. These findings
gave direct evidence of the neuroprotective function of
HPX in focal cerebral ischemia injury, indicating its
potential use in clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.
HPX is a plasma protein, which is recognized to serve
a protective function by binding and transporting free
heme, thus limiting the toxic effects that are mediated
by free heme. Cytotoxic properties of free heme are
thought to be involved in many complex cellular

mechanisms, including the release of redox-active iron,
production of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals; and peroxidation
of membrane lipids [16]. A number of ischemiareperfusion
directed pathological processes are thought to
be mediated by free heme oxidative stress pathways, including
heme-dependent lung oxidative stress [17], liver
reperfusion injury [18] and type 1 diabetes [19]. In vitro
experiments, heme was shown to be toxic to both cortical
neurons and astrocytes [10,20,21]. The primary defense
for cells against heme toxicity is currently thought to be
provided by a complex of heme with HPX, which has a
very high affinity for heme [22]. The heme-HPX complex
is taken up by cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis
, which is then catabolized by the heme oxygenase isozymes
(HO1 and HO2) [23]. Thus, HPX serves to regulate
the balance between free heme and bound heme, and/or
to regulate heme degradation. In this way HPX plays a
cytoprotective role in cell survival, and pivotally does so in
terms of short-term cellular defense as a powerful scavenger
of free heme. It was reported that HPX was also

synthesized locally by cells of CNS [6,9]. The present
study further delineated the cellular localization of HPX
in detail and found that HPX mainly expressed in cells of
vascular system, neurons in limited brain regions, as well
as astrocytes adjacent to blood vessels. These findings provide
bases for the action of HPX in central nervous system.
Beneficial effects of HPX in CNS injury have been
previously reported in transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion [10]. This study found that HPX-null mice
were more vulnerable to oxidative stress during cerebral
ischemia injury than their wild-type counterparts, an
observation which was consistent with a recent study
in cultured neuronal cells, which showed that HPX
decreased heme accumulation and catabolism [24]. Together
, these evidences indicate that HPX might offer
neuroprotective effects following ischemia-reperfusion
injury. In their study they also found that the mRNA
level of HPX was not increased after cerebral ischemiareperfusion.
However, they only examined at 96h, quite
long time after the onset of reperfusion. HPX has been
reported to be an atypical acute phase reactive protein
[25,26], protein expression might have been temporarily
changed in earlier phase. In the present study, we found
that protein level of HPX in the ischemic penumbra was
increased at 24h following ischemia-reperfusion injury
as compared with the sham-operated group. Elevated
HPX expression levels would attribute to a number of
functionally important cytokines by immune cells activated
during the process of stroke [27]. Inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α were identified as
potential promoters of the HPX gene [25,26].
It’s generally accepted that neurons and astrocytes in
the ischemic penumbra were most vulnerable to hemeinduced
cytotoxicity. In present study we found that in
comparison to the physiological conditions, the expression
of HPX protein was significantly increased after
cerebral ischemia, mainly in neurons and also in a small
amount of astrocytes located in the subendothelial layer
of the vessels. The cells that express augmented levels of
HPX were located in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
and striatum around the vicinity of the ischemic penumbra.
Increased availability of HPX expressed in these
local cells under ischemic condition combined with the
protein constantly expressed in the vascular system, enabled
HPX to deplete excess accumulation of overloaded
heme generated by the ischemia-reperfusion process
[28] in a relatively short period, thus avoid subsequent
irreversible damage. This could be interpreted as the
body’s endogenous protective mechanism to avoid suffering
from ischemia-reperfusion injury, in which process
HPX developed an important neuroprotective function. In
our study, this function was further confirmed using an
in vivo model of MCAO. We found that intracerebroventricular
administration of HPX improved neurologic
function and dampened infarct volumes in a dosedependent
manner following focal cerebral ischemia injury.
Moreover, the neuroprotective effects sustained for 7
days after reperfusion. Taken together, these data provide
novel insights that support the clinical utility of HPX in
attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury in CNS. Accumulated
evidences [10,17,18,24,29] have proven the protective
effect of HPX on different organs and cells. Our current
findings are consistent with these studies and provide
further evidence for the cytoprotective function of HPX.
Considering the poor efficacy, narrow treatment timewindow
, and the side effects of current therapeutic strategies
in stroke, HPX exhibits promising superiority in
improving the clinical management of stroke. Several
challenges remain for this to be realized. One of the
more challenging obstacles is to identify a clinically acceptable
means of delivering HPX to brain cells. Due to
its high molecular weight, it is challenging to adopt HPX
in clinical practice because it cannot readily transit the
blood–encephalic barriers to carry out its neuroprotective
effect. This is exemplified by the fact that low levels of
HPX, with a mean concentration of 2.6 mg/l and a range
of 1.8–3.4 mg/l [30,31] in the cerebrospinal fluid would be
insufficient to cope with the quantities of heme released
during ischemia reperfusion. Additionally, the mechanisms
underlying the neuroprotective effects of HPX in stroke
remain controversial. Fully understanding the mechanisms
of action of HPX will provide a hypothetical foundation to
optimize therapeutic strategies and formulate an international
standard for clinical practice. In conclusion, our
study has provided novel information whereby endogenous
cytoprotective mechanisms could be activated by
HPX in an attempt to clinically manage ischemia stroke.
Conclusion
In this study we found that HPX is mainly expressed in
vascular system and neurons, and is increased in penumbra
area after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Administration of the HPX induces an evident and longlasting
neuroprotective effect. These results indicate that
HPX might be developed as a potential agent for treatment
of ischemic stroke.
