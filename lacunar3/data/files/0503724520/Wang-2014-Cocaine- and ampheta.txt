Abstract—Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript
(CART) is a neuropeptide that plays neuroprotective roles
in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in animal
models or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in cultured
neurons. Recent data suggest that intranasal CART
treatment facilitates neuroregeneration in stroke brain. However
, little is known about the effects of post-treatment with
CART during the neuronal recovery after OGD and reoxygenation
in cultured primary cortical neurons. The present
study was to investigate the role of CART treated after OGD
injury in neurons. Primary mouse cortical neurons were subjected
to OGD and then treated with CART. Our data show that
post-treatment with CART reduced the neuronal apoptosis
caused by OGD injury. In addition, CART repaired OGD-
impaired cortical neurons by increasing the expression of
growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which promotes neurite
outgrowth. This effect depends on pleiotrophin (PTN) as siRNA-mediated
PTN knockdown totally abolished the increase
in CART-stimulated GAP43 protein levels. In summary, our
findings demonstrate that CART repairs the neuronal injury
after OGD by facilitating neurite outgrowth through PTN-
dependent pathway. The role for CART in neurite outgrowth
makes it a new potential therapeutic agent for the treatment
of neurodegenerative diseases.  2014 IBRO. Published by

INTRODUCTION
Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)
is a neuropeptide that is widely expressed in the brain
(Douglass et al., 1995; Larsen et al., 2003; Wierup
et al., 2004). CART has been involved in sorts of physiological
processes, including food intake, reward and
endocrine regulations (Kristensen et al., 1998; Rogge
et al., 2008). CART also has neuroprotective effects in a
rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
(Xu et al., 2006) or in cultured primary cortical neurons
exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) when
pre-treated with CART (Xu et al., 2006; Mao et al., 2007;
Jia et al., 2008). Previous data from our laboratory
showed that CART promotes hippocampal neuron survival
(Wu et al., 2006). In addition, we have also reported
that the CART inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress in a MCAO rat model and OGD model in cultured
cortical neurons by increasing the synthesis and secretion
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through
cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent
pathway (Qiu et al., 2013). Increasing evidence supports
that the CART has a strong protective effect on
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury when pre-treated
in vivo and in vitro. However, little is known about the
effects of post-treatment with CART during the neuronal
recovery or repair after neuron injury. Recently, Luo
et al. (2013) reported that intranasal administration of
CART starting from day 3 after MCAO in rats promoted
the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the subventricular
zone and enhanced migration of cells from subventricular
zone toward the ischemic cortex. In the
cultured primary cortical neurons, whether post-treatment
with CART also promotes neuronal restoration after OGD
and reoxygenation needs to be evaluated.
Pleiotrophin (PTN), also called neurite growthpromoting
factor 1, is expressed in the central and
peripheral nervous system during embryonic and early
postnatal development (Silos-Santiago et al., 1996).
Many studies have revealed the PTN-mediated effects,
such as neurite outgrowth, angiogenesis and mitogenesis

lines (Fang et al., 1992; Czubayko et al., 1995, 1996; Hida
et al., 2007; Yanagisawa et al., 2010). It has been shown
that the expression of PTN is strikingly increased in
microglia and astrocytes after ischemia/reperfusion injury
(Takeda et al., 1995; Yeh et al., 1998). However, it is still
unknown whether PTN is involved in the effects of CART
and facilitates neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons after
OGD injury.
In the present work, we studied the effect of CART
post-treatment on neurite outgrowth after OGD injury in
cultured cortical neurons and the possible role of PTN
involved.

Primary cortical neuron cultures
Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from
the cortex of neonatal mice (Day 1) as described
previously (Wu et al., 2006). Neonatal C57BL/6J mice
(1.5–2.0 g) were obtained from the animal facility of Peking
University Health Science Center. Briefly, the cells
were placed on the poly-L-lysine-coated dishes at a density
of 100,000 cells/cm2and incubated at 37C in humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO
2
for 4 h. The
medium was then replaced with serum-free neurobasal
medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 1% L-glutamine.
Half of the medium was replaced with the neurobasal
medium supplemented with B27 and L-glutamine every
2 days. Cells were used at Day 7. All animal care and
use protocols as set out in the guidelines of the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Peking University were
followed.
OGD
Seven days after plating, primary mouse cortical neurons
were incubated with DMEM without glucose under OGD
conditions: 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
at 37C in an anaerobic
jar (UniTech Bioscience, Guangzhou, PR china). Four
hours later, OGD was terminated by replacing OGD
media with serum-free neurobasal medium and cells were
further maintained in a regular CO
2
incubator under
normoxic conditions at 37C ( Fig. 1B). Control cultures
were placed in DMEM with 10% FBS in a normoxic (21%
O
2
) environment at 37C and the culture medium was
replaced with neurobasal medium after 4 h.
CART administration
After OGD, primary cultures of cortical neurons were
treated with 5 nM CART at 4 h (group M) or 20 h (group
N) after reoxygenation and were collected for protein
assay 48 h after OGD (Fig. 1A).
Transfection of siRNA
Seven days after plating, the cell culture medium was
replaced with the OPTI-MEM I medium and the neurons
were transfected with PTN siRNA at a final concentration
of 50 nM using Turbofect siRNA transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells
transfected with the scrambled siRNA were used as
negative controls. The sequences of mouse PTN siRNA
were as follows: PTN siRNA, sense: 50-GUGCAAACAGA
CCAUGAAGTT-30, antisense: 50-CUUCAUGGUCUGUUU
GCACTT-30; scrambled siRNA, sense: 50-UUCUCCGAA
CGUGUCACGUTT-30, antisense: 5 0-ACGUGACACGUU
CGGAGAATT-30. 48 h after transfection, cells were
processed for further analysis.
Western blot analysis
The cortical neurons were harvested on ice in the lysis
buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1:100 volume of halt
protease inhibitor cocktail. Aliquots of 30-lg total protein
were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5%
skim milk in Tris buffer saline (TBS) Tween-20 for 1 h
and then incubated overnight at 4C with the primary
antibody. After washing with TBST, the blots were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:6000) for 1 h at room
temperature and ECL reagent kits were used for protein
detection. The signals were quantified using quantity

one (Bio-Rad), and the values were normalized to b-actin
signal and presented as the mean ± SEM.
Immunofluorescence
Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after the
treatments. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-
MAP2 antibody (1:500). After washing, the cells were
incubated with a secondary antibody Goat Anti-Rabbit
IgG/FITC antibody (1:200). Mouse IgG was used as
negative controls. DAPI was stained to detect the
nucleus. Images were taken at 400 magnification with
a fluorescence microscope (Leica TCS SP5, LEICA,
Germany), using image analysis software (Leica
application suite, LEICA, Germany).
MTT assay
Neuronal viability was determined by MTT assay as
described previously (Hansen et al., 1989). Briefly, cells
were grown in 96-well plates and subjected to different
treatments. MTT solution was then added to reach a final
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cells were incubated for
another 4 h. The medium was then removed and 100ll
of DMSO solution was added. The absorbance was measured
at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Cell
survival rates were expressed as the percentage of the
controls (survival% = sample A570/mean control
A570100%).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses
were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons
among multiple groups were analyzed by a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by unpaired
Student’s t-test. P< 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
CART promotes survival of cortical neurons and
inhibits apoptosis induced by OGD in cortical
neurons
We first measured cell viability of neurons treated with
CART after OGD. Primary cortical neurons were treated
with different concentrations of CART 4 h after OGD for
24 h. Cells under normoxic conditions were used as
controls. Results from MTT assay indicated that OGD
significantly decreased the cortical neuronal viability
compared with the control group (F= 1.731,
P< 0.0001). After OGD, treatment of cells with different
concentrations of CART significantly improved cell
viability, with a marked increase at the concentration of
5nM  (F= 1.273, P< 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). The 5 nM of
CART was thus used in the following experiments. We
next investigated the effect of CART on neurons at two
different time points after OGD. Primary cortical neurons
were subjected to OGD and then treated with 5 nM
CART at 4 h after OGD, designated group M, or 20 h
after OGD, designated group N. The experimental plan
was illustrated in Fig. 1A. Cells were collected for cell
viability analysis 48 h after OGD. Results from MTT
assay indicated that in the presence of CART, the
viability of neurons was improved (F= 2.084,
P= 0.0356). After exposed to 4-h OGD, cells in both

experiments (n= 3).⁄P< 0.05, ⁄⁄P< 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P< 0.001.

groups M and N showed improved neuronal viability than
the OGD group without CART (group M, F= 3.224,
P= 0.0002; group N, F= 1.520, P= 0.0061)
(Fig. 1C). Moreover, the effect of CART in group M was
more obvious than that in group N, suggesting that early
intervention with CART benefits cell viability.
To investigate the possible reparable effect of CART
on neurons after OGD-induced oxygen and glucose
deprivation and reoxygen (O/R) injury, cortical neurons
were processed as illustrated in Fig. 1A with 5 nM
CART. Cells subjected to OGD exhibited markedly
higher expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase3
compared with the control cells (Bax, F= 2.124,
P= 0.0055; cleaved-caspase3, F= 4.900, P= 0.0068)
(Fig. 1D). Treatment with CART significantly reduced
the expression of these two apoptosis markers in both
group M (Bax, F= 4.539, P< 0.0001; cleavedcaspase3
, F= 1.383, P= 0.0021) and group N (Bax,
F= 2.011, P= 0.0183; cleaved-caspase3, F= 1.407,
P= 0.0135), as shown in Fig. 1D.
CART facilitates neurite outgrowth in cortical
neurons
To explore whether CART affects the neurites of cortical
neurons, cells were treated as illustrated in group M in
the presence or absence of CART and
immunofluorescence was performed to observe the
neurons by staining the cells with neuronal maker
MAP2. Results from immunofluorescent analysis
showed that neurites shrank and decreased after OGD.
Treatment with 5 nM CART 4 h after OGD, however,
alleviated the damage caused by OGD (Fig. 2A). The
number of neurons was then counted and 50–70 cells
were included in each group (Fig. 2B). Statistical
analysis revealed that the number of neurites was
significantly increased in cells without OGD after
treatment with CART. Exposure to OGD markedly
decreased the number of neurites compared with
controls (F= 1.218, P< 0.0001). Similarly, CART
significantly up-regulated the number of neurites in
OGD-treated cells (F= 2.493, P< 0.0001). To further
confirm the effect of CART on neurite outgrowth,
Western blot was performed to measure the expression
of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a marker of
axonal regeneration (Aigner et al., 1995; Console-Bram
et al., 1996; Benowitz and Routtenberg, 1997). Results
from Western blot analysis indicated that CART treatment
apparently increased GAP43 levels in control cells. The
expression of GAP43 in OGT-treated cells was significantly
reduced compared with controls (F= 1.130,
P= 0.0054). Administration of CART in groups M and
N dramatically raised the GAP43 levels in OGD-treated
cells (group M, F= 3.878, P= 0.0002; group N,
F= 4.878, P= 0.0101). In particular, the effect of CART
was much greater in group M than in group N (Fig. 2C).
CART induces the expression of growth factors
It has been reported that CART treatment significantly
increased the mRNA level of BDNF in subventricular
zone of stroke rats (Luo et al., 2013). To verify whether
post-treatment of CART has similar effects in cultured
cortical neurons, the expression of BDNF was measured.
Western blot analysis showed that the protein level of
BDNF was up-regulated in groups M and N compared

was performed to detect the effect of CART on the morphology
in O/R-treated cortical neurons. Cortical neurons were exposed to
OGD for 4 h followed by reoxygenation for 4 h. Cells were treated with

antibody MAP2 and incubated with DAPI to stain the nuclei. Scale bar

with the OGD group (group M, F= 3.368, P= 0.0046;
group N, F= 1.783, P= 0.0392) (Fig. 3). In control cells,
treatment of CART also significantly increased BDNF
expression (F= 1.037, P= 0.0187).
To investigate the possible mechanisms, we
measured the expression of PTN. Treatment of CART
increased the expression of PTN in both groups M and
N as compared to the OGD group (group M, F= 1.810,
P= 0.0003; group N, F= 1.045, P= 0.0469). In
control cells, CART also markedly increased the
expression of PTN (F= 6.914, P= 0.0020). Moreover,
the increased expression of PTN is more significant
than BDNF after OGD (Fig. 3).
PTN mediates the effect of CART on up-regulating
GAP43 and neurite outgrowth
To verify whether PTN mediates the CART-stimulated
neurite outgrowth, PTN siRNA or scrambled siRNA was
transfected into neurons. After 48 h, the cells were
exposed to 4-h OGD and treated with 5 nM CART at 4 h
after reoxygenation, as depicted in group M illustrated in
Fig. 1B. Proteins were extracted 48 h after OGD.
Western blot analysis confirmed that the protein level of
PTN was inhibited by transfection of PTN siRNA
(F= 2.660, P= 0.0003) (Fig. 4A). In addition, the
expression of GAP43 was decreased in neurons
transfected with PTN siRNA with or without CART
treatment (F= 1.872, P< 0.0001). Immunofluorescent
analysis also demonstrated that the number of neurites
was decreased in neurons transfected with PTN siRNA
with or without CART treatment (Fig. 4B, C). In contrast,
scrambled siRNA had no effect on GAP43 expression or
the number of neurites. Statistical analysis showed that
the number of neurites was significantly decreased in
PTN siRNA-treated cells compared with the scrambled
siRNA-treated cells (F= 1.516, P< 0.0001) (Fig. 4C).
To investigate the underlying mechanism by which
PTN is up-regulated by CART, the Extracellular
regulated protein kinases (ERK) antagonist PD98059 or
Protein kinase a (PKA) antagonist H89 was used to pretreat
the cells 30 min before CART treatment. Western
blot analysis showed that CART-induced up-regulation
of PTN was inhibited by both PD98059 (10lM)
(F= 3.674, P= 0.0001) and H89 (10lM) (F= 2.724,
P= 0.0001), indicating that PKA and ERK pathways
are involved in the restorative effect of CART (Fig. 5A).
To study whether PKA affects the ERK pathway in
CART treatment, H89 (10lM) was used to treat the
neurons 30 min before CART treatment to measure
ERK phosphorylation. Western blot analysis confirmed
that ERK phosphorylation was highly induced after
CART treatment (F= 5.508, P= 0.0006). Pretreatment
of H89, however, abolished the increase,
suggesting that ERK is downstream of the PKA pathway
(F= 6.184, P= 0.0008) (Fig. 5B).
DISCUSSION
It has been reported that CART peptide induced
neuroregeneration after stroke in vivo and increased the
proliferation of subventricular zone progenitor cells
in vitro (Luo et al., 2013). Different from their work, we
present here that post-treatment with CART facilitates
neurite outgrowth after OGD injury in cultured cortical
neurons.
Neurite outgrowth is crucial for neuronal restoration
after damage induced by stroke (McKeon et al., 1991).
Because neurites shrink and decrease during the stroke,
facilitating neurite outgrowth is important for the treatment
of this illness. Moreover, a large body of evidence has
suggested that apoptosis is implicated in the ischemia
and reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by stroke (Ding
et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Bu et al., 2014; Simoes
Pires et al., 2014). CART has neuroprotective effects. It
decreases infarct size after ischemic stroke in the MCAO
mouse model and protects cultured cortical neurons from
apoptosis induced by OGD (Wu et al., 2006; Xu et al.,
2006; Mao et al., 2007, 2012; Qiu et al., 2013). In a recent
study, Luo et al. have demonstrated that CART treatment
significantly enhanced GAP43 expression in the ischemic
cortex in rats 12 days after stroke (Luo et al., 2013). Consistent
with it, in the present work we found that CART

cortical neurons. Cortical neurons were treated with CART (5 nM) at 4
or 20 h after reoxygenation. 48 h after OGD, cells were harvested and
the proteins were extracted. The expression of BDNF and PTN was
analyzed by Western blotting. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of
three independent experiments (n= 3). ⁄P< 0.05, ⁄⁄P< 0.01,
⁄⁄⁄P< 0.001.

significantly up-regulated the expression of GAP43. In
addition, CART increased the number of neurites and
inhibited the expression of BAX and the cleavage of caspase3
during reoxygenation. Our data indicated that
CART facilitated neurite outgrowth and reduced apoptosis
during reoxygenation process after OGD, suggesting that
CART plays a role not only in neuronal protection, but also
in neuronal repair.
In ischemic cerebral stroke animal models, the
reperfusion window is within 3 h and the therapeutic
window is 3–6 h after the stroke (Kim et al., 2005). In
our study, two time points were selected for CART treatment
: One is at 4 h after reoxygenation, which is within
the therapeutic window (group M). At this time point the
injury has not stopped yet but O/R injury and repair have
already begun. The other is at 20 h after reoxygenation,
which is out of the therapeutic window. At this time point
the damage has already finished (group N). Our results
showed that neurons survived better in group M than in
group N, suggesting that the early intervention with CART
benefits neuron viability and repair.
Recent studies have demonstrated that PTN has
neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic neurons (Hida
et al., 2003). PTN was increased in striatum after the
lesion. It was also up-regulated in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
and neurons in spinal cord transaction. Furthermore
, PTN promoted axonal regeneration in spinal cord
motor neurons and functional recovery after neural transplantation
(Wang et al., 2004; Hida et al., 2007; Murasugi,
2014). However, it is still unknown whether the PTN facilitated
neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons. Our data
showed that CART significantly promoted the expression
of PTN and transfection of PTN siRNA abolished CART-
induced GAP43 expression and reduced the number of
neurites, suggesting that the repair effect of CART is
PTN dependent. It has been reported that CART protects
brain from damage through ERK activation in ischemic
stroke and increases cell proliferation in INS-1 (832/13)
cells via a PKA-dependent pathway (Jia et al., 2008;
Sathanoori et al., 2013). In our study, the antagonist of
PKA H89 and ERK antagonist PD98059 were used to
pre-treat the cells before the addition of CART. Our
results indicate that CART induces PTN/GAP43 up-regulation
and neurite outgrowth via PKA/ERK pathway.
It has been demonstrated that PTN promotes the
expression of BDNF and facilitated the secretion of
BDNF from microglia (Le Greves, 2005; Miao et al.,
2012). Additionally, BDNF can stimulate GAP-43 mRNA
expression and promote axonal regeneration. Moreover,
GAP-43 is essential for the neurotrophic effects of BDNF

(Kobayashi et al., 1997; Gupta et al., 2009; Ma et al.,
2012). In our study, the expression of BDNF, PTN and
GAP43 is up-regulated by CART, and the up-regulation
of GAP43 is PTN dependent. Further research is needed
to verify whether BDNF is involved in the up-regulation of
GAP43 by the expression of PTN.
CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that post-treatment with CART after
OGD-reoxygenation inhibits apoptosis and promotes
neurite outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons. The repair
effect of CART on OGD-injured neurons is PTN
dependent and via the PKA/ERK pathway. These findings
may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of
stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases.
