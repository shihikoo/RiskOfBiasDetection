Background:We tested the hypothesis that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) deficiency protected against acute
ischemic stroke (AIS)-induced brain injury.
Methods and Results:Wild-type mice (n = 54) were categorized into group 1 (sham control, n = 18) and group 3
[AIS by permanent ligation of left common carotid artery (CCA) and cramping right CCA for 1 h and then reperfusion
followed by hypoxia (11% of oxygen supply for 2 h), n = 36]. Similarly, tPA knockout (tPA−/−)mice(n=
54) were randomized into group 2 (sham control, n = 18) and group 4 (AIS, n = 36). By day 28 after AIS procedure
, mortality rate was higher in group 3 (77.8%) than ingroup 4 (38.9%) and lowest ingroups 1 (0%) and 2 (0%)
(pb0.001). By days 3 and 28, MRI demonstrated a pattern of changes in brain-infarct volume identical to that of
mortality among four groups (pb0.001). By day 28, protein expressions of inflammatory (MMP-9, TNF-α,NF-κB,
iNOS, PAI-1, RANTES), oxidative (NOX-1, NOX-2, oxidized protein), apoptotic (cleaved caspase-3 & PARP, Bax),
andfibrotic (Smad3, TGF-β) biomarkers and cellular expressions of inflammation (CD11, F4/80, GFAP), DNA-
damage (γ-H2AX) and brain-edema (AQP4) markers exhibited an identical pattern compared to that of mortality
(all pb0.001), whereas protein expressions of endothelial (eNOS, CD31), anti-fibrotic (Smad1/5, BMP-2) biomarkers
, and number of small vessels displayed an opposite pattern (all p b 0.001) among four groups.
Expressions of protein and cellular angiogenesis markers (VEGF, SDF-1α, CXCR4) were progressively increased
from groups 1 and 2 to group 4 (all pb 0.0001).
Conclusion:tPA deficiency protected the brain from AIS injury.

1. Introduction
Stroke, which affects 16.9 million people annually worldwide, is one
of the mostimportant globalcausesof mortality and disability[1,2].Surprisingly
, although the incidence, epidemiology, etiologies, mechanisms
, classification, and prognostic outcomes of ischemic stroke (IS)
have been extensively investigated for decades[1–9], an effective and
safe treatment strategy for patients after acute IS has not been fully
identified. Therefore, conventional therapy (i.e., supportive care and rehabilitation
) remains the mainstream of treatment for the majority of
patients after acute IS.
Until recently, a more aggressive thrombolytic therapy utilizing
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been proven to be effective for
some patients with acute IS early after the onset of symptoms[10,11].
However, major limitations of tPA therapy exist in daily clinical practice
[11–14], including the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and its
associated mortality[15–17]. Thus, tPA therapy is really a “two-edged
sword”in stroke treatment. Since the conventional treatment strategy
is not satisfactory and the application of tPA is also restricted by its
limitations, refinement of the use of the “two-edged sword”through a

deeperunderstanding its action is of paramountimportance for patients
with acute IS.
Numerous studies have previously shown the essential role of proteolytic
enzymes in invasion and migration of cancer cells through
cleavage of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that is dependent on the activation
of proteolytic enzymes, including elastase, cathepsin G, and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs)[18–21]. Our recent study has shown that
tPA upregulated MMP-9 activity[22]. Consistently, our another recent
study has demonstrated remarkably reduced MMP-9 activity in tPA-
deficient mice [23]. Furthermore, our previous study has revealed
that enhanced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1
prevented cardiac rupture in female and castrated mice after myocardial
infarction [24]. Clinically, it has been reported that IS, if extensive, is at
risk of hemorrhagic transformation, especially after receiving the thrombolytic
therapy [25]. These findings raise the hypothesis that tPA
deficiency may play an important role in impeding the development of
intracerebral bleeding after acute IS mainly through the reduction of
MMP-9 activity and ECM cleavage.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ethics
All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institute
of Animal Care and Use Committee at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital (Affidavit of Approval of Animal Use Protocol No. 2012110201)
and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals [The Eighth Edition of the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 2011)].
Animals were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-approved
animal facility in our hospital with controlled temperature and light
cycle (24 °C and 12/12 light cycle).
2.2. Animal grouping and experimental model of acute ischemic stroke
Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (n = 54) were categorized into sham
controls (i.e., WT-SC, n = 18) and WT-IS [by permanent ligation of left
common carotid artery (CCA) and cramping right CCA for 60 min and
then reperfusion followed by hypoxia (11% of oxygen supply for 2 h),
n = 36]. We found that to utilize such an experimental study could consistently
create the acute IS model in mice. Similarly, tPA knockout
(tPA−/−) mice (n = 54) were randomized into tPA−/−SC (n = 18)
and tPA−/−IS (n = 36).
The protocol and procedure of mouse acute IS were based on our
previous report with some modifications [26]. Adult WT and tPA−/−
mice (Charles River Technology, BioLASCO Co. Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan),
weighing 25–30 g, were utilized in the present study. All animals were
anesthetized by 2.0% inhalational isoflurane, supine on a warming pad
(37 °C).
In WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups, incision was made on the skin of
the neck and both left common carotid artery (LCCA) and right common
carotid artery (RCCA) were exposed without ligation, followed
by skin closure. On the other hand, in WT-IS and tPA−/−IS groups,
after exposure of the LCCA through a transverse neck incision, the
vessel was permanently ligated. Additionally, after exposure of
RCCA through a transverse neck incision, a small incision was made
on the RCCA through which a nylonfilament (0.028 mm in diameter)
was carefully advanced into the distal right internal carotid artery for
occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) to cause brain
infarction of its supplied area. The nylon filament was removed
60 min after occlusion, followed by closure of the muscle and skin
in layers. All animals were allowed to recover in a portable animal intensive
care unit (ThermoCare®)for24h.
2.3. Procedure and protocol of brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) study
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at days 3 and 28
after acute IS induction. Briefly, during MRI measurements, mice were
anesthetized by 3% inhalational isoflurane with room air and placed in
an MRI-compatible holder (Biospec 94/20, Bruker, Ettingen, Germany).
Rectal temperature and respiration were monitored throughout the
procedure to ensure maintenance of normal physiological conditions.
MRI data were collected using a Varian 9.4 T animal scanner (Biospec
94/20, Bruker, Ettingen, Germany) with a mouse surface array. The MRI
protocol consisted of 40 T2-weighted images. Forty continuous slice
locations were imaged with afield-of-view of 30 mm × 30 mm and an
acquisition matrix dimension of 256 × 256 and slice thickness of
0.5 mm. The repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) for each fast spinecho
volume were 4200 ms and 30 ms, respectively. A custom software,
ImageJ (1.43i, NIH, USA), was used to process the region of interest (ROI).
Planimetric measurements of images from MRI T2 were performed to
calculate the stroke volumes of cortex.
2.4. Corner test for assessment of neurological function
The sensorimotor functional test (Corner test) was conducted for
each mouse at baseline and on day 21 after acute IS induction as we previously
described[26,27].Briefly, the mouse in each group was allowed
to walk through a tunnel and then into a corner, the angle of which was
60°. To exit the corner, the mouse could turn either left or right. The results
were recorded by a technician who was blind to the study design.
This test was repeated 10 to 15 times with at least 30 s between each
trial. We recorded the number of right and left turns from 10 successful
trials for each animal and used the results for statistical analysis.
2.5. Specimen collection and preparation for individual study
For examination of protein expression, animals in all groups were
sacrificed on day 28 after brain MRI examination, and the brain of
each mouse was promptly removed, immersed in cold saline, snapfrozen
in liquid nitrogen and then stored at−80 °C for individual
study. Additionally, some of brain tissues were frozen in OCT blocks
(Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Netherlands) for immunofluorescent (IF) and immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining studies. Furthermore, some of brain
tissues werefixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS (pH 7.4), and
soaked in 20% sucrose in 1× PBS (freshly prepared) until the brain
tissues were completely immersed.
2.6. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining of brain specimens
The procedure and protocol of IF staining was based on our previous
reports[26–28].Indetails,frozensections(4μm thick) were obtained
from the brain infarct area of each animal, permeated with 0.5% Triton
X-100, and incubated with antibodies against NeuN (1:1000, Millipore),
glialfibrillary acid protein (GFAP; 1:500, DAKO), aquaporin4 (AQP4;
1:200, Abcam), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 1:400,
Abcam), SDF-1α (1:100, Santa Cruz), CD31 (1:200, AbD Serotec),
CXCR4 (1:100, Abcam), CD11 (1:500, Abcam), F4/80 (1:100, Abcam),
andγ-H2AX (1:500, Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. Alexa Fluor488, Alexa
Fluor568, or Alexa Fluor594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG
were used to localize signals. Sections were finally counterstained
with DAPI and observed with afluorescent microscope equipped with
epifluorescence (Olympus IX-40).
Three brain sections were analyzed for each mouse. For quantification
, three randomly selected high-powerfields (HPFs; 400× or 200×
for IF study) were analyzed in each section. The mean number of
positively-stained cells per HPF for each animal was then determined
by summation of all numbers divided by 9.

2.7. Western blot analysis of brain specimens
The procedure and protocol of Western blot were based on our previous
reports[28–30]. In details, equal amounts (50μg) of protein extracts
were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide
gradients. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred
electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
(Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific sites were blocked by
incubation of the membrane in blocking buffer [5% nonfat dry milk in
T-TBS (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20)] overnight. The membranes
were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against CD31 (1:1000,
abcam), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (1:200, abcam),
VEGF (1:1000, abcam), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α (1:1000,
Cell Signaling), NOX-1 (1:1500, Sigma), NOX-2 (1:500, Sigma), matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (1:3000, abcam), tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α; 1:1000, Cell Signaling), nuclear factor (NF)-κB (1:600,
abcam), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (1:200, abcam), plasminogen
activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (1:1000, abcam), RANTES (1:1000, Cell
Signaling), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (1:1000, Cell Signaling
), mitochondrial Bax (1:1000, abcam), Caspase 3 (1:3000, abcam),
Smad3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), Smad1/5 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 (1:1000, abcam), and transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β(1:500, Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature.
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
immunoglobulin IgG (1:2000, Cell Signaling) was used as a second antibody
for 1 h at room temperature.
The Oxyblot Oxidized Protein Detection Kit was purchased from
Chemicon (S7150). The procedure of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
(DNPH) derivatization was carried out on 6μg of protein for 15 min according
to the manufacturer's instructions. One-dimensional electrophoresis
was carried out on 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel after DNPH
derivatization. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
which were then incubated in the primary antibody solution (anti-
DNP 1: 150) for 2 h, followed by incubation with the second antibody
solution (1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. The washing procedure
was repeated eight times within 40 min.
Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Medical X-rayfilm
(FUJI). For quantitation, ECL signals were digitized using Labwork
software (UVP). A standard control sample was loaded on each gel.
2.8. Vessel density in brain infarct area
The procedure and protocol for identification of small vessel in brain
infarct area were basic on our previous reports[22,23,27].Indetails,IHC
staining of small blood vessels was performed withα-SMA (1:400) as
primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing
with PBS thrice. Ten minutes after the addition of anti-mouse-HRP conjugated
secondary antibody, the tissue sections were washed with PBS
thrice. Then 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0.7 g/tablet) (Sigma) was
added, followed by washing with PBS thrice after one minute. Finally,
hematoxylin was added as a counter-stain for nuclei, followed by washing
twice with PBS after 1 min. Three brain sections were analyzed in
each mouse. For quantification, three randomly selected HPFs (100×)
were analyzed in each section. The mean number per HPF for each animal
was then determined by summation of all numbers divided by 9.
2.9. Statistical analyses
Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was
performed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison
post hoc test. All analyses wereconducted using SAS statistical software
for Windows version 8.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC). A probability value
b0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Serial changes in neurotically functional status, infarct volume/total
brain volume (%) by day 3 and 28, and mortality by day 28 after acute IS
procedure (Figs. 1 and 2)
Corner test for determining neurological function showed no difference
among the four groups at day 0 prior to acute IS induction and 28
after acute IS. However, by day 3 after acute IS, the neurological function
was significantly impaired in WT-IS groupthan that in tPA−/−IS, WT-SC
and tPA−/−SC groups, and significantly higher in tPA−/−IS group than
that in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups but it exhibited no difference between
the latter two groups. Additionally, by day 14 after IS procedure,
the neurological function was significantly impaired in WT-IS and
tPA−/−IS groups as compared with those of WT-SC and tPA−/−SC
groups, and significantly impaired in WT-IS group than in tPA−/−IS
group, but it showed no difference between the former or later two
groups (Fig. 1).
By days 3 and 28 after acute IS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
study demonstrated that the brain infarct volume was significantly larger
in WT-IS group than that in other groups, and significantly higher in
tPA−/−IS group as compared with that in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups,
but it showed no difference between the latter two groups (Fig. 2).
The mortality rate in the study period was significantly higher in
WT-IS group [77.8% (28/36)] than that in tPA−/−IS [38.9% (14/36)],
WT-SC (0%) and tPA−/−SC (0%) groups, and significantly higher in
tPA−/−IS groupthan that in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC, but there wasnosignificant difference between the latter two groups. Further detailed analysis
demonstrated that all mortalities in the WT-IS and tPA−/−IS groups
occurred within 5 days after IS procedure in the present study (Fig. 2).
3.2. The protein expressions of inflammatory biomarkers in the brain
infarction zone by day 28 after acute IS (Fig. 3)
The protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and
RANTES, six inflammation biomarkers, were significantly higher in the
WT-IS group than those in other groups and significantly higher in
tPA−/−IS group than those in the WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups, but it
showed no difference between the latter two groups.
3.3. The protein expressions of oxidative stress biomarkers in the brain
infarction zone by day 28 after acute IS (Fig. 4)
Theproteinexpressionsof NOX-1 and NOX-2, twoindicators of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), were significantly higher in WT-IS group
than those in the other groups, and significantly higher in tPA−/−IS
group than those in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups, but these parameters
did not differ between the latter groups. Consistently, the protein expression
of oxidized protein, an indicator of oxidative stress, showed a
pattern identical to that of NOX-1 and NOX-2 among the four groups.
3.4. The protein expressions of apoptotic, fibrotic and anti-fibrotic
biomarkers in the brain infarction zone by day 28 after acute IS (Fig. 5)
Theprotein expressionsofmitochondrialBax, cleavedcaspase 3, and
PARP, three indices of apoptosis, were significantly higher in WT-IS
group than those in the other groups, and significantly higher in
tPA−/−IS group than those in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups, but they
were similar between the latter two groups. Additionally, the protein
expressions of Smad3 and TGF-β, two indicators offibrosis, showed an
identical pattern compared to that of apoptosis among the four groups.
On the other hand, the protein expressions of Smad1/5 and BMP-2, two
anti-fibrotic biomarkers, exhibited a pattern opposite to that of apoptosis
among the four groups.

3.5. Cellularexpressions of GFAP, AQP4, andγ-H2AX in brain infarct zone by
day 28 after acute IS (Fig. 6)
The cellular expression of glialfibrillary acid protein (GFAP), an indicator
of inflammatory cells, was significantly higher in WT-IS group
than that in other groups, and significantly higher in tPA−/−IS group
than that in WT-SC and tPA−/−SC groups, but this parameter did not
differ between groups 1 and 2. Similarly, thecellularexpression of aquaporin
4, an indicator of brain edema, showed pattern identical to that of
GFAP among the four groups.
The cellular expression of γ-H2AX, an indicator of DNA damage,
displayed an identical pattern compared to that of GFAP expression in
brain infarct zone among the four groups.
Figures 7 to 10 which displayed the cellular and protein expressions
of angiogenesis, MMP-9 and inflammatory biomarkers were discussed
in supplementary section (i.e., including the results andfigure legends).
4. Discussion
This study, which investigated the impact of tPA deficiency on the
prognostic outcomes after acute IS, yielded severalstrikingimplications.
First, the infarct volume was remarkably larger in wild-type animals
than that in tPA-deficient animals by days 3 and 28 after acute IS.
Second, the neurological function was worse in wild-type mice than
that in tPA-deficient animals by days 3 and 14 after acute IS. Third, the
angiogenesis biomarkers in brain infarct zone were less detectable in
wild-type animals than those in tPA-deficient animals. Fourth, the
mortality rate in the study period was significantly higher in wild-type
animals than that in tPA-deficient animals.
The most importantfinding in the present study is that the mortality
rate was significantly higher in WT-IS group than that in tPA−/−IS
group. Additionally, one principalfinding in the present study is that
brain MRI showed a significantly larger infarct volume in WT-IS mice
as compared with that in tPA−/−IS mice. Interestingly, an association
between an increased brain infarct volume and poorer prognostic outcome
has been previously reported in both experimental [26,27] and
clinical observational[31]studies. Accordingly, ourfindings, in addition
to being supported by the previous studies[26,27], could at least partly
explain the remarkably higher mortality rate in WT-IS animals than that
in tPA−/−IS animals.
Surprisingly,subgroupanalysisshowed that mortalityof theanimals
always occurred within 4 days after the induction of acute IS. Thisfinding
may imply that fatality could be attributable to the larger brain infarct
size compared with that in the survivors. Besides, this finding
might also explain the significantly deteriorating neurological function
from day 3 to day 14 after IS in WT-IS animals as compared with that
in tPA−/−IS mice.
Another principalfinding in the present study is that angiogenesis
biomarkers were notably increased in tPA−/−IS group as compared
with those in the WT-IS group at both protein and cellular levels. This
finding is consistent with that of our previous studies showing that
different organs possess intrinsic ability of generating pro-angiogenic
factors in response to ischemic stimulation[22,23,29,30].

cellular and protein levels of inflammatory biomarkers, cellular level
of GFAP and AQP4, and protein level of apoptotic biomarkers were substantially
increased in WT-IS animals as compared with those in the
sham controls. However, as compared to the WT-IS animals, these parameters
werefound to be remarkably reduced in thetPA−/−ISanimals.
Thesefindings, in addition to strengthening those of previous studies
[26,27,32], could also partially explain the poorer prognostic outcome
in WT-IS mice compared with that in tPA−/−IS mice.
We remain uncertain regarding the significant increases in brain infarct
volume and mortality rate in WT-IS animals compared to those in
their tPA−/−IS counterparts. There may be several plausible explanations.
First, our previous study[24]has revealed that enhanced expression
of plasminogen activator inhibitor prevents cardiac rupture after
myocardial infarction. In the present study, the intrinsic deficiency of
tPA just mimicked the enhancement of expression of plasminogen activator
inhibitor. Second, it iswell recognized that tPA cleaves theinactive
form of plasminogen to active form of plasmin[26,27,32]which, in turn,
breaks up the thrombus in the vessels and restores the bloodflow. Since
the wild-type mice had undoubtedly significantly higher plasmin activity
than that in the tPA-deficient mice, restoration of bloodflow would
increase the risk of bleeding complication. Third, extra-cellular matrix
(ECM), which plays an essential role in maintaining the architectural integrity
of all organs including the brain, disintegrates on encountering
MMP-9, which is known to be activated by tPA [18–23,32].Onthe
other hand, an increase in the activity of MMP-9 after vessel occlusion
and thrombus formation would increase the risk of expansion of brain
ischemic/infarct zone, which in turn increased the risk of bleeding
complication.Inthepresentstudy, we found the MMP-9activity wasremarkably
attenuated in tPA-deficientmicecomparedwiththatinwildtype
mice due to the loss of plasmin activity in the former. This could,
once again, explain the notably higher brain infarct volume and mortality
in wild-type animals compared with those in their tPA-deficient
counterparts.
Interestingly, a previous report has demonstrated aggravated neuron
damage from tPA therapy [32]. Besides, another experimental
study has shown that endogenous tPA plays a paradoxical role in focal
cerebral ischemic injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion [33].
While it protects against focal cerebral ischemic injury through its
thrombolytic action on transient occlusion with mild damage, it aggravated
the condition of persistent occlusion with severe damage.[33].In
this way, thefindings from previous studies[32,33]support the results
of our study.
In contrast to tPA therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) which is associated with a relatively low incidence of
cerebral hemorrhage [34], tPA therapy for patients with acute IS contributes
to an unacceptably high incidence of cerebral hemorrhage
[35]. Nevertheless, due to the lack of more effective treatment strategy,
tPA is stillrecommended[36]. Althoughthe National Institutesof Health
Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time window, and risk factors have been included
in the currentclinical guidelinefor tPA therapy in the settingof ischemic
stroke[36], the brain infarctvolume and thenecessityfor dosageadjustment
have not be addressed. Thus, the results of the present study not

only may provide a biological basis for the understanding of tPA treatment
on brain infarct volume and mortality by using a gene-deficient
murine model, but may also raise the issue of taking the brain infarct
volume and dosage adjustment into consideration before implementation
of tPA treatment.
4.1. Study limitation
This study has limitations. First, the long-term outcome in animals
after acute IS was not investigated. Second, the design of the current
study did not include the administration of exogenous tPA into tPA
gene-deficient mice so that the mortality rate, brain infarct volume,
and neurological function could not be compared between WT-IS
mice and their tPA−/−IS counterparts with exogenous tPA treatment.
Third, importantly, a number of biological systems may show paradoxical
effects according to stimuli, doses, short-term or long-term
contact with different environment, and pharmacology does not
necessarily mimic the spontaneous biological effects of any natural
substance, when used as a drug. Besides, it should be much more
cautious when extrapolating our experimental results as a reference
for consideration of the influencing indications, dosage, efficacy and
side effects of thrombolytic therapy in similar clinical setting of patients
after acute IS.
In conclusion, the results this study not only demonstrated that tPA-
gene deficiency plays a crucial role in the protection of the brain from
acute IS injury, but also remind the possible necessity for reconsideration
of the current exclusion and inclusion criteria for tPA therapy in patients
after IS.
