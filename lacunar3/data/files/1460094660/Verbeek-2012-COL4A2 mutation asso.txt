Familial porencephaly, leukoencephalopathy and small-vessel disease belong to the spectrum of disorders ascribed to dominant
mutations in the gene encoding for type IV collagen alpha-1 (COL4A1). Mice harbouring mutations in either Col4a1 or Col4a2
suffer from porencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral and ocular bleeding and developmental defects. We observed porencephaly
and white matter lesions in members from two families that lack COL4A1 mutations. We hypothesized that COL4A2 mutations
confer genetic predisposition to porencephaly, therefore we sequenced COL4A2 in the family members and characterized
clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical phenotypes. Genomic sequencing of COL4A2 identified the heterozygous missense
G1389R in exon 44 in one family and the c.3206delC change in exon 34 leading to frame shift and premature stop, in the
second family. Fragmentation and duplication of epidermal basement membranes were observed by electron microscopy in a
c.3206delC patient skin biopsy, consistent with abnormal collagen IV network. Collagen chain accumulation and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress have been proposed as cellular mechanism in COL4A1 mutations. In COL4A2 3206delC fibroblasts we
detected increased rates of apoptosis and no signs of ER stress. Mutation phenotypes varied, including porencephaly, white
matter lesions, cerebellar and optic nerve hypoplasia and unruptured carotid aneurysm. In the second family however, we found
evidence for additional factors contributing to the phenotype. We conclude that dominant COL4A2 mutations are a novel major
risk factor for familial cerebrovascular disease, including porencephaly and small-vessel disease with reduced penetrance and
variable phenotype, which might also be modified by other contributing factors.

INTRODUCTION
Porencephaly is defined as a cavity in the cerebral parenchyma
communicating with the lateral ventricles, which results from destruction
of the parenchyma after a developmental defect or an intracerebral
haemorrhage. Porencephaly has both genetic and non-genetic
causes. Mutations in the type IV collagen alpha-1 (COL4A1) gene,
coding for the procollagen alpha-1 chain of collagen IV, have been
associated with variable phenotypes. COL4A1 mutations predispose to
germinal matrix haemorrhage in late pregnancy or around birth,
which can lead to deep venous infarction with subsequent tissue
necrosis and porencephalic cavitation. When the haemorrhage occurs
during gestation or around birth it usually manifests as congenital
hemiplegia.1–5 Familial porencephaly with congenital hemiplegia has
been ascribed to autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the
COL4A1 gene. Although a number of rare monogenetic disorders may
predispose to intracerebral haemorrhage, such as CADASIL, Fabry’s
disease, autosomal dominant amyloid angiopathy, MELAS, homocystinuria
, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, Marfan and Maeda
syndrome,1,2,5 only mutations of COL4A1 have been associated with
familial porencephaly.3 The phenotypic manifestation of COL4A1
mutations is, however, quite variable both within and among families,
with different presentations in children or adults. As well as porencephaly
, COL4A1mutations predispose to a variety of vascular lesions in
the brain and other organs, leading to the conclusion that COL4A1
mutation causes a multisystem disease.6The cerebral lesions vary from
deep intracerebral haemorrhage, to diffuse leukoencephalopathy, or
small-vessel disease with deep lacunar infarcts, dilated perivascular
spaces, silent microbleeds or (unruptured) intracranial aneurysms. In
mutation carriers, symptoms are variable, including congenital hemiplegia
, transient ischaemic attack, adult-onset haemorrhagic stroke,
rarely brain infarction, and may even be absent.7–10 At the severe end
of the spectrum, massive prenatal bleeding leading to apparent
hydranencephaly, renal agenesis and early demise have been
described.11 Other organs can also be affected. Ocular features can
be associated with COL4A1 mutations such as retinal arteriolar
tortuosity, ocular cataract, anterior segment dysgenesis and microcornea.9,12–15 Other manifestations are cardiac arrhythmia, renal
cysts, haematuria, hepatic cysts, muscle cramps and elevated creatine

kinases. The HANAC syndrome (hereditary angiopathy, nephropathy,
aneurysms and muscle cramps) has been specifically associated with
mutations in exons 24 and 25 of the COL4A1 gene.8,16 COL4A1
mutations are often described within a familial context, but can also
occur de novo, without a family history of bleeding.11,17 Although
heterogeneous, the common association of the symptoms has led to
the definition of general criteria for consideration of COL4A1 genetic
testing.6 The identification of a familial COL4A1 mutation helps to
monitor complications and supports genetic counselling.
Non-fibrillary collagen IV is a major component of the extracellular
matrix and basement membranes and consists of six alpha chains,
encoded by distinct and tandem located genes, respectively, on
chromosome 13q (COL4A1 and COL4A2), 2q (COL4A3 and
COL4A4) and Xq ( COL4A5 and COL4A6). COL4A3 to COL4A6
mutations all cause Alport syndrome and benign familial haematuria.
COL4A1 and COL4A2 are under regulation of the same promoter and
encode for the procollagen IV alpha-1 and IV alpha-2 chains, which
assemble to form a heterotrimeric helix with a constant 2:1 ratio,
[alpha1(IV)]2[alpha2(IV)]. Among collagen IV genes, only COL4A1
and COL4A2 are ubiquitously expressed.18 This explains why the
basement membranes of several epithelia and endothelia can be
affected by a COL4A1 mutation. Mutations in the human COL4A1
gene were originally identified after description of the prenatal cerebral
and ocular bleeding in mice bearing mutations in the homologue
Col4a1 gene.3 Because of the common function, mutations in the
collagen IV alpha-2 gene were supposed to cause similar manifestations
and in fact, mice bearing heterozygous Col4a2 missense mutations
survive the postnatal period but show haemorrhage in the eye,
brain, and skin and developmental defects of the eye and brain19
similar to Col4a1 mutants. We observed porencephaly, white matter
lesions suggestive of small-vessel disease and aneurysms in members of
two families, fulfilling the criteria for COL4A1 testing, but without
evidence for COL4A1 mutation. We therefore explored by a candidate
gene approach the involvement of COL4A2 and its potential role in
human disease.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Patient study
All tested individuals and legal caretakers gave their informed consent for the
study, according to the Dutch local ethical committee requirements. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data were
performed according to Lobel et al.20–22 Transmission electron microscopy of
the skin biopsies was performed in double-blind experiments and independently
scored by two investigators.8
Genomic COL4A1 sequence analysis was according to Breedveld et al.7
Primers were designed and analysis performed for the genomic sequence of
COL4A2. RT-PCR was performed as described.21 RT-qPCR was performed
using KAPA sybr fast qPCR mix ABI prism (KAPA Biosystems, Boston, MA,
USA) and the CFX96 Real Time System (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands
). Skin fibroblast culture and test for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
was conducted by western blot and RT-qPCR according to Lin et al.23 Staining
for the collagen-specific chaperon HSP47 and the ER stress marker KDEL24was
performed under standard culture condition and after stress induced by DTT in
control and patient fibroblasts. A fluorescent kit for multiple active caspases
was used (Flica apoptosis detection kit, Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC,
Bloomington, IN, USA). For additional details see the Supplementary data.

Family A. The proband III-2 was the first of this Caucasian
family to present at the age of 6 months with a right-sided hemiparesis
(Figure 1a). Her prenatal course was complicated by oligohydramnion.
Brain MRI at the age of 3 years and 8 months showed
left-sided porencephaly and right-sided periventricular white matter
hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted images. At the age of 4.5 years
she has a moderate learning disability. Eye fundoscopy is normal.
(Figures 2a and b).
Subject III-1 was born at 38 weeks of a normal gestation
and developed normally. A brain MRI at the age of 8 years
revealed patchy white matter lesions. Eye fundoscopy is normal
(Figure 2c).

The mother (II-2) is asymptomatic at the age of 31 years.
The brain MRI was normal, while MRA revealed bilateral internal
carotid artery aneurysms at the level of the cavernous sinus
(Figure 2d).
Subjects II-4, II-5 and I-1 are all reported to have a right-sided
hemiparesis. No medical records are available.
Family B. This consanguineous family of Afghani ancestry includes
two probands (II-2 and II-5) (Figure 1b).
Proband II-2 was born at term of a normal gestation with a birth
weight of 2500g (3 SD). At the age of six months a right-sided
hemiparesis was noted. At the age of 16 years he has an intelligence
quotient of 48, a dystrophic appearance with microcephaly and a
right-sided dystonic paresis. Brain MRI revealed left-sided cerebral
atrophy with porencephaly and Wallerian degeneration of the brain
stem (Figures 2e, k–m). Ophthalmological examination showed
severe myopia with bilateral amblyopia and small optic discs, but
no arteriolar tortuosity. Proband II-5’s prenatal course was complicated
by maternal diabetes and intrauterine growth retardation.
A caesarian section was performed at 31 weeks of gestation because
of fetal distress. Cerebral ultrasound at birth showed a right-sided
subependymal bleeding with venous infarction. At 6 months brain
MRI revealed a porencephalic cyst and hypoplastic left cerebellar
hemisphere (Figures 2f and g). Physical examination at the age of
1 year showed a left-sided hemiparesis and borderline microcephaly
(2 SD). Ophthalmological examination, renal ultrasound and echocardiogram
were normal. Screening for coagulopathies in the neonatal
period showed a suspected protein S deficiency, but no analysis was
repeated afterwards.
The mother (I-2) has hypothyroidism. She was small at birth and
had feeding difficulties. Ophthalmological examination showed high
myopia, astigmatism and tilted optic discs with some peripapillary
atrophy. Permission for brain imaging was denied. She also delivered
two daughters who died of complicated congenital hydrocephalus
(subjects II-1 and II-4). Brain MRI of one daughter (II-4) at the age of
2 months showed extreme hydrocephalus with periventricular cystic
lesions, stenosis of the Sylvius aqueduct and periventricular, subcortical
and cerebellar calcifications (Supplementary Figure S1). Another
son (subject II-3) is mildly intellectually disabled with a total intelligence
quotient of 62, a normal head circumference and normal brain
MRI. Her last pregnancy was uneventful, was monitored by ultrasound
and ended with the birth of a third daughter (subject II-6) in
the 38th week. At birth cerebral ultrasound revealed a small intraparenchymal
bleeding. The girl developed a mild hemiparesis, milder
than the probands; her brain MRI revealed a small right-sided cerebral
intraparenchymal cyst (Supplementary Figure S2). Extensive coagulopathy
screening at the age of 2 years revealed a heterozygote protein S
deficiency.
Sequence analysis and expression data
COL4A1. DNA sequence of the 52 coding exons and intron–exon
boundaries of COL4A1 in subjects III-1 and III-2 of family A and
subjects II-5 and I-1 of family B was normal.7 A maximum number of
13 heterozygote SNPs were observed in the sequence of each individual
, which excludes the presence of large deletions in one of the
COL4A1 alleles.
COL4A2. Family A: DNA sequencing of part of the 5¢ UTR and the
48 exons and intron-exon boundaries of COL4A2 was performed in
subjects III-1, III-2, III-3 and II-2. In patient III-2, III-1 and II-2 a
heterozygous missense change, c.4165G4A in exon 44, leading to an
amino acid substitution of glycine by arginine at position 1389
(p.G1389R) was found (Figure 1c). COL4A2 was normal in patient
III-3. Glycine 1389 is part of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat, which is essential
for the proper folding of the triple helix,18,25 and is highly conserved
through species and among all the six collagen IV genes. In silico
analysis by Polyphen-2 and SIFT prediction programs indicated this
change as probably damaging.
Family B: Subjects II-2, II-3, II-5, II-6, I-1 and I-2 were tested. In
probands II-2, II-5 and subject I-2 COL4A2 sequencing showed a
heterozygous c.3206delC deletion in exon 34 leading to a frameshift
and premature stop at position +27 (Figure 1d). The COL4A2
sequence was normal in subjects I-1, II-3 and II-6. No DNA was
available from patient II-1 and II-4. RT-PCR of the COL4A2
transcript in patient II-2’s fibroblasts was performed. Only a transcript
of the expected wild-type sequence was observed, compatible with
degradation of the mutant mRNA by nonsense-mediated decay.
Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of COL4A2 and COL4A1 transcript
in fibroblasts from the same patient was performed and confirmed
diminished amount of COL4A2 compared with COL4A1 mRNA
(Figure 1e).
Skin transmission electron microscopy
Electron microscopy of the skin of patient II-2 from family B showed
abnormalities of the epidermis–dermis junction with scattered thickening
, blurring and duplications of the basement membrane (Figures
3b and c). These abnormalities were not observed in control skin
(Figure 3a) and are similar to those seen in COL4A1 patients.8
ER stress response and apoptosis
The mouse Col4a1+/D ex40 mutation leads to synthesis of abnormal
Col4a1 chains, which accumulate in the ER of lens epithelia. This
accumulation activates the unfolded protein response, a well-known
ER stress response preceding apoptosis.20,24,26 As the c.3206delC
COL4A2 mutation predicts a null-allele and no such mutations have
been described in human COL4A1 patients, we investigated the
pathogenic mechanism of this mutation in cultured skin fibroblasts
from proband II-2. We wondered whether ER stress could be induced
by abnormal stoichiometry of COL4A1 and COL4A2 chains, because
of reduced COL4A2 synthesis.
ER stress response was analysed by staining fibroblasts with antibodies
anti HSP47, a collagen-specific chaperon protein, and anti
KDEL, an ER stress marker specific for ER-retained proteins. If
collagen chains accumulate in patient cells, then increased storage of
HSP47 can be expected.24,26 Under standard culture conditions,
HSP47 staining was comparable in patient and control cells, suggesting
no accumulation of unfolded collagen chains (Supplementary
Figure S3). Subsequently, we analysed whether KDEL staining under
standard and stress conditions, induced by DTT, would detect ER
stress in patient cells. Under the DTT condition, we know that normal
cells slightly increase susceptibility to apoptosis from 10 to 18%
(Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S5).27 No clear signs of ER
stress were detected by KDEL staining under DTT in the patient cells
(Supplementary Figure S4).24 We then tested whether signs of expression
of ER stress markers could be detected by western blot analysis
using antibodies specific for IRE1, cleaved form of ATF6, CHOP, BiP
and by real time-PCR for XBP-1 splicing.23 We did not detect
expression of the markers in the patient cells, similarly to a control
cell line (Figures 4a and b). As positive control, tunicamycin-treated
control cells showed increased expression of markers, which means
that the stress response was negative rather than below detection level.
As ER stress is supposed to trigger apoptotic cell death, we studied
COL4A2 in porencephaly

sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis under standard conditions and
stress stimuli. Under stress induced by DTT, we observed an abnormally
high percentage (460%) of apoptotic cells in the patient
compared with five control cell lines (Figure 4c). No difference was
observed in the absence of DTT treatment (Supplementary Figure S5).
We conclude that COL4A23206delC fibroblasts do not show signs of
ER-stress, although the patient-derived cells show more signs of
stress-induced apoptosis.
DISCUSSION
Pathogenesis of COL4A2 mutations
Using the knowledge of the Col4a2 mouse model, we have used a 
candidate gene approach in our porencephaly families, and we provide
evidence that COL4A2 mutations represent a novel genetic risk factor
for haemorrhagic porencephaly and small-vessel disease.
We describe cerebral abnormalities, including porencephaly,
small-vessel disease in the form of scattered white matter lesions,
carotid aneurysm, cerebellar and eye abnormalities in two families,
associated with two dominantly inherited changes in COL4A2
(G1389R, c.3206delC), all in the triple helix domain of the procollagen
IV alpha-2 protein. Carotid aneurysm and cerebellar hypoplasia have
been observed in a single mutation carrier, respectively, in family A
and B (Table 1), making a causal relationship possible but not
definitive.
Extensive data from several types of collagens have shown that
missense and splice site mutations in the triple helix domain are highly
pathogenic and particularly substitutions of the glycine at each third
position (G-Xaa-Yaa) disrupt the triple helix structure, with a dominant
negative effect. These missense mutations lead to abnormal
assembly of the triple helix with intracellular accumulation of procollagen
chains.24 The stereotypical nature of pathogenic glycine
missense mutations in collagens makes therefore mutation recognition
relatively easy compared with other genes. Considering the cosegregation
of the G1389R mutation with the cerebrovascular disease we
Figure 4 COL4A2 c.3206delC mutation does not cause endoplasmic reticulum stress but reveals susceptibility to apoptosis. (a) Western blot analysis for
endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (IRE-1, cleaved form of ATF6, CHOP and BiP) was negative in patient II-2 (family B) and control skin fibroblasts.
(b) XBP-1 mRNA, which is spliced in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, was evaluated by RT-PCR. Patient and control samples did not show
detectable levels of spliced XBP-1. Tunicamycin treated cells were included as a positive control (+) in A and B. Untreated cells were used as a negative
control (). (c) Mean percentage of apoptotic cultured fibroblasts after stress induction by dithiothreitol. WRS: fibroblasts from patient with mutation in

conclude that this mutation is involved in the pathogenesis of the
porencephaly and white matter lesions observed in family A.
The c.3206delC frame-shift mutation found in family B leads
to loss of COL4A2 chain synthesis from one allele, however,
the pathogenic mechanism might be different from the G-Xaa-Yaa
type of mutation, as it is predicted to cause a loss of function
and null-alleles have not been described in patients harbouring
COL4A1-mutations.
In support of a pathogenic effect of the c.3206delC mutation, we
observed an increased susceptibility to apoptosis and, in addition,
EM of patient skin showed abnormalities of the epidermal basement
membranes, suggesting abnormal extracellular collagen-IV assembly.
Heterozygote truncating mutations have already been observed
in collagen IV-related Alport syndrome, but null alleles for the
C. elegans COL4A1 homologue, emb-9 and COL4A2 homologue
let2 cause disruption of the basement membrane and embryonic
lethality, although at a later stage than the G-Xaa-Yaa missense
mutations.28
The non-collagen domain of collagen IV alpha-2, but not alpha-1
chain, promotes cell adhesion, outgrowth of embryonic neurons and
is responsible for strict regulation of the 2:1 stoichiometry of the triple
helix.18,29–31
This could indicate that a disturbed ratio of procollagen alpha-1
and procollagen alpha-2 chains due to a heterozygous null allele of
either COL4A1 or COL4A2 may lead to a disturbed or insufficient
heterotrimer assembly and secretion.
The mechanism leading to stroke and porencephaly is presumably a
decreased resistance of the vascular wall to increased mechanic stimuli.
In the lens epithelia of Col4a1+/D ex40 mice accumulation of COL4A1
and COL4A2 in the ER induces an ER stress response, a known trigger
of apoptosis.24 Nevertheless, studies supporting this mechanism in
human COL4A1 mutations are lacking. We observed increased susceptibility
of c.3206delC patient fibroblasts to apoptosis, possibly
related to ER stress, which, however, could not be detected under
our experimental conditions. Future studies are needed to address this
discrepancy, which might be caused for example by the culture
conditions compared with experiments performed in mouse tissues.20,26 Apoptosis is an important mechanism regulating brain
development and is involved in the onset of microcephaly.32 Some
of the COL4A2 patients are born microcephalic and the reason is not
apparent at the moment, but it could be related to susceptibility of the
developing brain to apoptosis.27 It is also possible that, independently
of the ER stress, COL4A2 and the apoptotic pathways are linked as
they are developmentally co-regulated. In fact, it has been shown that
micro RNA mir-29b represses expression of both COL4A2 and
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 during skeletal development.33,34
COL4A2 mutation: phenotypic variation and reduced penetrance
COL4A1 and COL4A2 are ubiquitously co-expressed in the basement
membrane of epithelia and endothelia and from the observation of
mouse Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutations, human COL4A1 and COL4A2
mutations could be predicted to result in cerebral bleeding. However,
only COL4A1 mutations have been identified after linkage in large
pedigrees.3 One of the reasons could be the difficulty to recruit large
families with similarly affected patients, because of phenotypic variability
or reduced penetrance of COL4A2 mutations, similarly to other
causes of stroke and aneurysm,35 which makes linkage analysis quite
difficult.
We can assume reduced penetrance of the COL4A2 mutations in
both our families.
In family A subject II-2 has the G1389R mutation and is asymptomatic
, but MRI revealed a carotid aneurysm, similar to the findings in
an obligate carrier of COL4A1 mutation that we previously described.7
In family B, we also observed an asymptomatic carrier (subject I-2)
of the c.3206delC COL4A2 mutation, who presents ocular anomalies
but denied an MRI. Asymptomatic carriers have been observed also in
COL4A1 mutation and, although this has been interpreted as reduced
penetrance of the mutation, extensive investigation has often revealed
hidden signs of the disease.3,7 However, considering the wide heterogeneity
of symptoms, the contribution of other factors, besides the
COL4A1 mutation, has been suggested as trigger of the pathogenic
event.3
In both our families, a wide intra-familial phenotypic variation has
been observed, similar to COL4A1mutations.7In Col4a1 mutant mice
it has been shown that the genetic background is important to determine
the phenotype, probably through the effect of modifying loci.24
Col4a2 mutant mice present with cerebral porencephaly, microphthalmia,
lens opacity, buphthalmos and renal anomalies, but in general with a
milder phenotype compared with Col4a1-deficient mice.19
Interestingly, in family B we observed an individual (subject II-6),
affected by a perinatal intraparenchymal bleeding leading to a cyst,
who lacks the familial COL4A2 mutation (Supplementary Figure S2)
and additional children died at young age with severe cerebral
haemorrhage and hydrocephalus, who were not tested for COL4A2
mutations. Subject II-6 is heterozygote for protein S deficiency, which
in itself has not been the cause of the bleeding but might have
contributed to the onset of the germinal matrix haemorrhage. As
for COL4A1 mutation carriers, it is therefore possible that in this
family additional factors have summed up and contribute to the
phenotypic manifestation.
The particular fragility of the cerebral vessels in patients with either
COL4A1 or COL4A2 mutations remains unexplained in light of the
ubiquitously expression of COL4A1 and COL4A2. However, it could
reflect selective expression in subtypes of brain vascular endothelia.4 It
has been shown that in the kidney expression of COL4A3, COL4A4
and COL4A5 genes can be cell-type specific.36,37
In summary, we observed that familial COL4A2 mutations could
lead to a wide spectrum of cerebrovascular disorders, including
porencephaly, white matter lesions and possibly aneurysm and cerebellar
hypoplasia, which might go undiagnosed because of reduced
penetrance and variable expression. Additional risk factors may
influence the course of cerebrovascular diseases in families with
COL4A2 mutations.
