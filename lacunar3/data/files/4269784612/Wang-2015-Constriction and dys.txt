Increasing evidence indicates that poor outcomes after brain hemorrhage, especially after
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), can be attributed largely to dysfunction of the cerebral
microcirculation. However, the cause of this dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we
investigated changes in the cerebral microcirculation after regional hemorrhage in the
subarachnoid space using the closed cranial window technique in mice. A single pial
arteriole on the surface of the brain was punctured to induce a regional hemorrhage in the
subarachnoid space. Physiological parameters were monitored during the procedure, and
microvessel diameter was measured after hemorrhage. The vasoreactivity of the arterioles
in response to hypercapnia as well as to topical application of the vasodilator acetylcholine
(ACh) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) were assessed. The constriction of pial
arterioles was detected without changes in other physiological parameters. Decreased
reactivity of pial arterioles to all of the applied vasodilatory stimuli was observed after
hemorrhage. Our results indicate that regional hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space can
induce the vasospasm of microvessels and also reduce the vasoreactivity of pial arterioles.

1. Introduction
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a subtype of stroke that
accounts for approximately 5% of all strokes (Graf and
Nibbelink, 1974; King, 1997). Almost 40% of patients with
SAH die within 30 days after onset (Ingall et al., 1989; Kissela
et al., 2002), and despite improvements in the diagnosis and
treatment of SAH, the mortality rate has not changed
(Connolly et al., 2012). Vasospasm of the large conducting
cerebral arteries is regarded as the major cause of delayed
ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs), which result in morbidity
and mortality in patients with SAH (Macdonald et al.,
2007). However, this type of vasospasm cannot fully account
for the occurrence of DINDs, because symptoms of cerebral
ischemia can occur in patients without evidence of angiographic
vasospasm (vasospasm of the large conducting cerebral
arteries) (Graham et al., 1983; Pennings et al., 2004).
Clinical and experimental studies have indicated that cerebral
microcirculatory dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology
of DINDs after SAH (Friedrich et al., 2012; Herz

et al., 1975; Pennings et al., 2009; Pennings et al., 2004; Sun
et al., 2009).
Because dysfunction of the cerebral microcirculation results
in cerebral ischemia after SAH, leading to poor outcomes
and occasionally death, detection of the underlying mechanisms
is required to improve the outcomes for SAH patients.
Many potential causes have been suggested for the dysfunction
of cerebral microcirculation after SAH, such as elevated
intracranial pressure (Asano and Sano, 1977; Schubert et al.,
2009) and the vasoactive properties of blood products that are
also regarded as the cause of vasospasm of the large cerebral
arteries (Clark and Sharp, 2006; Dreier et al., 2002; Loftspring,
2010). To discover the mechanisms underlying cerebral microcirculation
dysfunction, it is necessary to elucidate the contributions
of different factors. Hence, we investigated the
effects of regional hemorrhage (without intracranial pressure
elevation) of pial arterioles in the cerebral microcirculation
in mice.
2. Results
2.1. Changes in pial vessel diameter after regional
hemorrhage
The constriction of pial arterioles in the hemorrhage region
was observed in all animals and could be detected from 3 h
after hemorrhage (Figs. 1 and 2). The average pial arteriole
diameter was decreased by 31.5%, 32.2%, 32.2%, and 25.6% at
3, 12, 24, and 48 h post-hemorrhage, respectively, compared
to the baseline value. No significant changes were detected in
the diameter of pial venules exposed to blood in subarachnoid
space. These results indicate that regional hemorrhage
in the subarachnoid space caused the pial arteries to constrict
immediately and continually for at least 48 h.
2.2. Responses to hypercapnia
No significant differences were observed in the baseline
vascular diameters between the sham-operated and hemorrhage
groups (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the response of the pial
arterioles to hypercapnia was significantly reduced at 24 h
after hemorrhage. The vasoreactivity was decreased by 48.1%
(from a value of 36.2% to 18.8%, Fig. 3B). In both groups, the
partial pressure of CO
2
(PaCO
2
) was maintained at 25–35 mm
Hg during the resting state, with an increase to 55–65 mm Hg
during hypercapnia. No statistical differences were found in
the physiological parameters including PaCO
2
and partial
pressure of O
2
(PaO
2
) between two groups (Table 1). These
results show that vasoreactivity to hypercapnia was reduced

Significant constriction was found from 3–48 h after
hemorrhage (po0.01 vs. baseline). Constricted arterioles
were observed as early as 3 h after hemorrhage and until
48 h after hemorrhage. They tended to recover at 48 h after
hemorrhage. (B) No significant changes in the diameters of
venules were observed after hemorrhage.

in mice with regional hemorrhage, and this reduction could
not be attributed to differences in the extent of PaCO

change
after induced hypercapnia, other physiological parameters, or
baseline vascular diameter.
2.3. Responses to acetylcholine(ACh)
The baseline vascular diameter did not differ significantly
between the sham-operated and hemorrhage groups (Fig. 4A).
Reduced vasoreactivity to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator
ACh was observed at 24 h after hemorrhage. Compared
to the vasoreactivity in the sham-operated animals
(41.8%), the vasoreactivity in the hemorrhage group was
decreased by 57.2% (to 17.9%, Fig. 4B), which implicates
dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs) in pial arteries after
hemorrhage.
2.4. Responses to S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP)
Again, the baseline vascular diameter did not differ significantly
between the sham-operated and hemorrhage groups (Fig. 5A). A
greater reduction in vessel response to topical application of the
smooth muscle cell (SMC)-dependent vasodilator SNAP was
observed in mice in the hemorrhage group compared to that in
the sham-operated group. The average vasodilation of pial
arterioles in response to SNAP was 41.6%, but this was decreased

(Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated the dysfunction of SMCs in
pial arterioles after pial arteriole hemorrhage.
3. Discussion
The main findings of the present study are as follows: 1) the
constriction of pial arterioles rather than pial venules was
observed after regional hemorrhage in the subarachnoid
space; 2) the reactivity of pial arterioles to hypercapnia was
significantly decreased after regional hemorrhage compared
to after sham operation in mice; and 3) the vessel responses
to the EC-dependent vasodilator Ach and the SMC-dependent
vasodilator SNAP were both decreased after regional brain
hemorrhage. Our results confirm the dysfunction of cerebral
microcirculation after pial arteriole hemorrhage in mice and
demonstrate that the dysfunction of both ECs and SMCs may
cause this microcirculatory dysfunction in the brain after
regional hemorrhage in subarachnoid space.
The cerebral microcirculation maintains the normal cerebral
blood flow (CBF), which is critical for the normal
functioning of the brain. The general principles of fluid
dynamics apply in that CBF(F) is directly related to pressure
(P) and inversely affected by resistance (R)( Kulik et al., 2008):
F¼
P
R
Of course, resistance is inversely related to the 4th power
of the diameter of the vessel (Kobari et al., 1984). Thus, small
reductions in the diameter of arterioles can induce significant
increases in resistance and ultimately could result in a
dramatic decrease in CBF. If constriction of the arterioles
occurs in patients with SAH, it is reasonable to speculate that
this could induce a drop in CBF and subsequently cause
ischemic brain injury. Uhl et al. reported moderate-to-severe
segmental constriction in arterioles in SAH patients during
aneurysm surgery using an orthogonal polarization spectral
imaging system (Uhl et al., 2003), and these findings were
confirmed by Pennings et al. using the same methods in SAH
patients (Pennings et al., 2004). In the present study, our
results showed the constriction of arterioles after pial arteriole
hemorrhage. Similar observations have been described in
other SAH models (Friedrich et al., 2012; Herz et al., 1975;
Morii et al., 1986;Parfenova et al., 1993;Sehba et al., 2007;Sun
et al., 2009), but the present study has several advantages
compared to these previous studies. First, in our study, large
amounts of subarachnoid autologous blood were present in
the perivascular space. This model induced a perivascular
environment similar to that observed in humans after SAH
(Pennings et al., 2004; Uhl et al., 2003). Second, mice were
used in this study, which makes it possible to employ
transgenic mice to explore the underlying mechanisms.
In the present study, we found that the constriction of the
microvessels occurred in arterioles rather than venules. In
addition, the constriction of arterioles began early (o3 h after
SAH) and lasted at least 48 h after hemorrhage. Also, the
arterioles constricted by about 30% compared to baseline
values. This reduction in vessel diameter could be severe
enough to cause a significant decrease in CBF according to the
Hagen-Poiseuille law, by which a reduction in vessel diameter
by 30% results in a reduction of flow by approximately 80%
(Friedrich et al., 2012). Assuming that the constriction of
arterioles occurs immediately after SAH in the whole brain
instead of a limited region, the decrease in CBF would be
enough to cause the clinical symptoms of cerebral ischemia
before the development of delayed cerebral vasospasm. An
acute decrease in CBF after SAH also could induce cerebral
ischemia and brain edema and ultimately result in DINDs.
In addition to the diameter of arterioles, the function of
arterioles is also very important in the regulation of CBF. Our
results indicate the occurrence of vasomotor impairment after
regional SAH. We observed an impaired vascular response to
hypercapnia at 24 h after hemorrhage, which suggests that
microcerebrovascular autoregulation is profoundly impaired
after hemorrhage. Some studies have reported similar observations
using papaverine in humans with SAH (Pennings et al.,
2009). Next, we tested the responses to the EC-dependent
vasodilator Ach and SMC-dependent vasodilator SNAP to explore
the cellular events responsible for cerebrovascular dysfunction
after brain hemorrhage. Our results demonstrate impairment of
SNAP-induced vasodilation in mice after hemorrhage, which
Fig. 5 – (A) No difference was found between the baseline
vascular responses of the pial arterioles in the shamoperated
and hemorrhage groups (p¼0.22). (B) The
vasodilation (%) of pial arterioles in response to the SMC-
dependent agent SNAP was 41.6% in the sham-operated
group and only 23.9% in the hemorrhage group (po0.01).

suggests abnormal SMC function after hemorrhage. Similarly,
abnormal EC function in our hemorrhage model was found using
the EC-dependent vasodilator Ach. Taken together, these results
imply that the dysfunction of both ECs and SMCs contributes to
the dysfunction of the microcirculation after SAH. However,
further studies are required to confirm these effects in different
experimental models of SAH as well as to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms.
In contrast to our findings, Britz et al. obtained conflicting
results using CO
2
, adenosine, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)
in an endovascularfilament model of SAH in rats (Britz et al.,
2007). They found that CO
2
reactivity was unaffected by SAH.
This discrepancy may be due to differences in specific experimental
methodologies, including variations in anesthesia,
the method of cerebrovascular assessment, and the applied
vasoactive stimuli as well as differences in animal species
(Table 2). More importantly, in the endovascular filament
model, no perivascular subarachnoid blood could be detected
at the surface of the parietal cortex where the cranial
windows were installed. In our animals, the microvessels
detected were surrounded by blood, which is similar to the
situation in human SAH patients.
Several previous studies have investigated changes in
vasoreactivity after SAH (Pennings et al., 2009; Sobey et al.,
1996; Sobey and Quan 1999; Vatter et al., 2007). However,
most of these studies focused on the responses of basilar
arteries to vasodilators after SAH (Sobey et al., 1996; Sobey
and Quan, 1999; Vatter et al., 2007), which are related to the
cerebral vasospasm of large arteries. In contrast, our study
provided evidence of impaired cerebral microcirculation
through observation of changes in the pial arterioles. Similar
to ourfindings, Park et al. also reported impaired responses of
microvessels to the endothelium-dependent dilator in their
ex vivo study (Park et al., 2001).
In summary, our results demonstrate the constriction and
dysfunction of pial arterioles after regional hemorrhage in
subarachnoid space. Further studies are needed to identify
the underlying mechanisms.
4. Experimental procedure
4.1. Animal preparation
The animal use and care protocols, including all procedures,
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Jinling Hospital and conformed tothe Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
Three–four-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased
from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) for use in the present study. They were
acclimated in a humidified room and maintained on the
standard diet at the Animal Center of Jinling Hospital for
ten days before experiments. The temperature in both the
feeding room and the operation room was maintained at
approximately 25 1C.
4.2. Cranial window installation and induction of
hemorrhage
The microcirculation of the right parietal cortex was visualized
through a closed cranial window, which was implanted
as previously reported with modification (Brendza et al., 2005;
Han et al., 2008). Briefly, a 4-mm-diameter craniotomy was
performed with a water-cooled dental drill in the right
parietal bone after the skin was removed. A single pial
arteriole was punctured with the tip of a forceps after the
skull cap was removed. This method induced regional bleeding
in subarachnoid space. Next, two lines of tubes that could
be used as an inlet and outlet for vasodilator infusion into the
cerebrospinal fluid bathing the pial vessels were inserted
through the bone wax. Then, the craniotomy was sealed to
the bone with a coverslip using dental cement, and the
resulting space filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid

completion of the procedures, the mice were returned to their
cages for recovery with access to food and water ad libitum.
4.3. Experimental design
The first set of experiments was performed to assess the
morphological changes in vessels after SAH. One pial arteriole
and one pial venule with diameters of 15–20μm were
selected for analysis. The vessel diameter in each mouse
(n¼12) was measured atfive time points: baseline (during the
procedure before regional hemorrhage induction) and 3, 12,
24, and 48 h post-hemorrhage. At each time point, the
animal was placed under the microscope, and images were
taken through the cranial windows after the mice were

anesthetized with α-chloralose (80 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.
p.], Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
The second set of experiments was designed to explore
the vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, ACh, and SNAP after
hemorrhage. Two groups of mice were used: a shamoperated
group (n¼6) and a hemorrhage group (n¼6). In both
groups, vasoreactivity (the vascular response to vasoactive
stimuli) was tested at 24 h after cranial window implantation.
4.4. Vasoreactivity to hypercapnia
The responses of the vessels to hypercapnia were detected to
assess the ability of vascular regulation after hemorrhage.
The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Hospira, Lake
Forest, IL, USA) and α-chloralose (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and ventilated
at a stroke volume of 5 ml/kg body weight and ventilation
rate of 150 strokes/min with a rodent ventilator (Harvard
Apparatus Co., Holliston, MA, USA). Body temperature was
maintained at 37 1C using a heating pad (Harvard Apparatus
Co.). An arterial catheter was placed into the femoral artery
for measurement of the mean arterial blood pressure (MBP)
and blood gases. The isoflurane was reduced gradually to
zero before the mouse was placed under the microscope.
After an equilibration period, an image of the region with a
clear pial arteriole (15–20μm in diameter) without injury and
located in the region of bleeding was taken for comparison to
baseline conditions while the animals were ventilated with
30% O
2
-containing air. Subsequently, changes in PaCO
2
were
induced by ventilating the animal with 5% CO
2
/30% O
2
-
containing air for 5 min. Blood gases were analyzed before
hypercapnia, 4 min after hypercapnia, and 4 min after recovery.
Images were taken through the cranial windows after
completion of hypecapnia.
4.5. Vasoreactivity to ACh
The endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh (100μM; Sigma-
Aldrich) was infused into the cranial window at a rate of
20μl/min for 5 min after the baseline image was taken. Upon
completion of Ach infusion, another image was taken
through the cranial window, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid
was then infused for 10–20 min or until the vessel diameter
returned to its baseline value.
4.6. Vasoreactivity to SNAP
The vascular SMC-dependent vasodilator SNAP (500μM; Sigma-
Aldrich) was infused into the cranial window at a rate of
20μl/min for 5 min after the baseline image was taken. Upon
completion of SNAP infusion, another image was taken through
the cranial window, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid was then
infused for 10–20 min or until the vessel diameter returned to its
baseline value. The order of vasodilatory agent treatment was
randomly assigned.
4.7. Vessel diameter measurement
Vessel diameter was determined using Diamtrak software
(Tim Neild, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia) as
described previously (Han et al., 2008). Briefly, averaged vessel
diameters across a 25-μm longitudinal segment (at least four
consecutive segments were measured per artery) of the
vessels of interest were analyzed before (baseline) and after
exposure to hypercapnia, Ach, or SNAP. The vasoreactivity
was calculated as the percent (%) vasodilation relative to the
baseline vessel diameter.
4.8. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means7standard error of the mean
(SEM). Comparisons among multiple groups were performed
by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's
multiple comparison method. P values o0.05 were considered
significant.
