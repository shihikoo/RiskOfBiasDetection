Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases remain an important cause of morbi-mortality. Atherosclerosis, which predisposes to cardiovascular disorders
such as myocardial infarction and stroke, develops silently over several decades. Identification of circulating biomarkers to evaluate cardiovascular
event risk and pathology prognosis is of particular importance. Microparticles (MPs) are small vesicles released from cells
upon apoptosis or activation. Microparticles are present in blood of healthy individuals. Studies showing a modification of their concentrations
in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and after cardiovascular events identify MPs as potential biomarkers of disease.
Moreover, the pathophysiological properties of MPs may contribute to atherosclerosis development. In addition, pharmacological compounds
, used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, can reduce plasma MP concentrations. Nevertheless, numerous issues remain
to be solved before MP measurement can be applied as routine biological tests to improve cardiovascular risk prediction. In particular,
prospective studies to identify the predictive values of MPs in pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases are needed to demonstrate
whether MPs are useful biomarkers for the early detection of the disease and its progression.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases remain an important cause of morbi-
 mortality. Atherosclerosis, which predisposes to cardiovascular
disorders, is often accompanied by endothelial dysfunction and
associated endothelium injury [1]. Endothelial cells produce
chemoattractant factors, which induce monocyte recruitment and
infiltration in the neo-intima. There, monocytes differentiate into
macrophages and capture oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
infiltrated from the circulation to the neo-intima, leading to the

formation of inflammatory foam cells. Pathology progresses with
exacerbated macrophage accumulation, with smooth muscle cell
proliferation and migration from the media to the intima, collagen
production and lesion calcification. Finally, erosion and rupture of
the plaque induce thrombus formation, causing arterial occlusion,
culminating in the acute clinical event. Atherosclerosis develops
silently for many years before clinical manifestations occur.
However, early detection of atherosclerotic lesion formation may
allow measures to prevent the progression of the pathology
towards clinical events. As imaging techniques do not allow early
detection and cannot be used routinely, identification of circulating
biomarkers is of particular importance to predict cardiovascular
disease risk and pathology prognosis [2].
Cell apoptosis, inflammatory activation and cellular stress in
general [3] occurring during atherosclerosis development induce
the formation of MPs. Microparticles are small vesicles, between
0.1 and 1 m in diameter. They are present in plasma of healthy
individuals and their concentrations change in various clinical conditions
[4]. Microparticle concentrations are increased in patients
with cardiovascular risk factors and after cardiovascular events.
Moreover, certain pharmacological treatments, used to treat 
cardiovascular diseases, lower plasma MP concentrations.
Consequently, MPs emerge as cardiovascular disease markers of
particular interest. The pathophysiological effects of MPs in vivo
are still poorly understood. However, studies performed with MPs
generated in vitro from cell lines or isolated ex vivo have shown
that they can influence various processes involved in atherogenesis
, such as endothelial function, angiogenesis, inflammation and
thrombosis, suggesting that MPs are not only markers, but also
actors in cardiovascular diseases.
The purpose of this review is to report the current knowledge
regarding the role of MPs in cardiovascular diseases. First, we
will describe the mechanisms of MP formation, MP structure, and
MP preparation and quantification. Subsequently, we will discuss
qualitative and quantitative differences between MPs and their
association with cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, as well
as their pathophysiological effects in atherogenesis. Finally, we
will discuss data showing MP regulation by pharmacological
treatments.
Microparticle formation, structure 
and composition
Microparticle formation
During their lifespan, cells are submitted to stimuli which can trigger
MP shedding, a physiological mechanism leading to the evasion
of “eat-me” signals, hence preventing cell recognition and
phagocytosis by macrophages. This process is exacerbated under
conditions such as inflammation, apoptosis or other cellular
stresses, which enhance MP production. Although the formation
process of MPs remains to be completely elucidated, it is clear that
MP formation and shedding involve reorganization of membrane
phospholipid distribution, with outer leaflet exposure of phosphatidylserine
(PS), and modification of the cell architecture, with
the disruption of cytoskeleton organization. Several studies report
the existence of vesicles which are similar in size as MPs but which
do not expose PS in the outer leaflet [5–8]. The nature and the
mechanisms of formation of these vesicles are poorly understood,
but could be due to cytoskeleton cleavage with maintenance of the
asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane.
The mechanisms involved in cellular MP release are summarized
in Figure 1. In quiescent cells, the distribution of phospholipids
in the bilayer is asymmetric, with aminophospholipids (PS, 
phosphatidylinositol) localized in the inner leaflet, whereas neutral
phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine)
are in the outer leaflet. This asymmetric distribution is under the
control of three proteins. The aminophospholipid translocase 
(or flippase) is an ATP-dependent protein driving the transport of
aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet. This transporter
is inhibited by high levels of calcium [9]. The floppase is
also an ATP-dependent protein, allowing transport of phospholipids
from the inner to the outer leaflet [10]. Finally, the scramblase
induces random movements of phospholipids inside the
membrane and is activated by increased levels of calcium [11]. In
the absence of stimuli, at normal calcium concentrations, only the
flippase is active, allowing localization of aminophospholipids in
the inner leaflet. Increased intracellular calcium following cell
stimulation inhibits flippase, whereas it activates floppase and
scramblase, inducing movement of aminophospholipids from the
inner leaflet to the outer leaflet. The role of scramblase in this
process has been illustrated in patients with Scott syndrome who
have a mutation in a scramblase encoding gene, in whom vesiculation
of cells is impaired inducing coagulation defects [12]. In
addition to modifying the activity of proteins maintaining phospholipid
bilayer asymmetry, the increase of intracellular calcium
activates proteases, such as calpain, which trigger cytoskeleton
reorganization and/or destruction. Involvement of calpain in
platelet vesiculation has been shown by inhibition of this protein
which decreases MP release [13]. Treatment with cytochalasin D,
which inhibits actin polymerization, also decreases MP formation
[14]. Caspases are also involved in MP release. In the Jurkat T cell
line, caspase-3 mediates the cleavage of ROCK I, a Rho-kinase,
leading to MP release during apoptosis [15]. In endothelial cells,
thrombin induces a specific pathway of endothelial vesiculation
involving nuclear factor (NF)-B and TRAIL, leading to ROCK II
activation by caspase 2 [16]. Thus, modifications of the cytoskeleton
, associated with the accumulation of phospholipids in the
outer leaflet, cause a membrane blebbing that leads to MP shedding
from the cell.
Various stimuli induce MP release from cells in vitro.
Inflammatory cytokines (i.e. tumour necrosis factor [TNF]), 
apoptosis inducers (i.e. staurosporin), transcription blockers (i.e.
actinomycin D) or cellular stress inducers (i.e. hydrogen peroxide,
ultraviolet light or serum deprivation) induce MP generation in cell
lines [17–20]. By contrast, little is known on the mediators and the
mechanisms behind MP generation in vivo.

Microparticle composition and structure
Microparticles are constituted of material from their cells of origin,
the exposure of PS on the external surface being a general characteristic
of MPs.
Microparticles of different origins may differ in their phospholipid
content. For example, the phospholipid composition of MPs
isolated from blood of healthy donors consists, for the majority, of
phosphatidylcholine (about 60%), sphingomyelin (~20%), phosphatidylethanolamine
(~10%) and PS (~5%) [21].
Microparticles could express inflammation markers, growth
factors and metalloproteinases (MMP) [22]. Platelet and monocyte-derived
MPs express tissue factor (TF) which together with
the PS exposure plays a role in their pro-coagulant properties.
Initially, MPs were considered to be microvesicles free of
nucleic acids [23]. However, recent studies have identified the
presence of DNA and RNA in MPs generated in vitro from Jurkat
and HL-60 cells [24, 25], and miRNA and pre-miRNA in MPs and
exosomes from human mesenchymal cells and embryonic stem
cells [26, 27].
Lipid, phospholipid and protein composition of MPs vary
according to the cell origin, but interestingly, the stimulus of
their formation can also modify MP composition. For example,
endothelial cells submitted to apoptosis (by growth factor depletion
) or activation by TNF in vitro release quantitatively and qualitatively
distinct MPs [28]. Proteomic analysis has revealed that
the spectrum of proteins found in MPs released in vitro from cultured
cells depends at least in part on the stimulus used to
induce their formation [29]. The identification of proteins at the
MP surface allows cell origin determination. During blebbing,
cell surface remodelling can lead to enrichment and/or elimination
of various components from the cell. Therefore, MPs from
the same cell origin can differ with respect to surface antigens,
and some MPs may not express the surface antigens of the
mother cell.
These components, phospholipids, proteins and, possibly,
nucleic acids are responsible for the biological properties of MPs,
as further described.
Microparticle isolation, preparation
and measurement
The methods of preparation and measurement of MPs in biological
samples vary among different research teams, and need standardization
for MPs to become useful as disease biomarkers. We
summarize here the main methods to prepare and quantify MPs.
However, new methodologies of quantification of MPs are applied
to this research field which have the potential to be used in the
future (for review, see Ref. [30]).
Microparticle preparation
For MP quantification, cell-free samples need to be prepared
before analysis. Microparticles can be measured in plasma, after
removing platelets, and can be also isolated from tissues or cell
culture supernatants.

mechanisms of MP formation. (A) In quiescent

Pre-analytical treatment of plasma
Generally, blood samples are collected on citrate, and kept at room
temperature to avoid platelet lysis leading to subsequent errors in
MP quantification. In the literature, only few reports address the
needle size used for blood collection. Tushuizen et al. used a 19G
needle [31]. Microparticles are analysed in platelet-free plasma
(PFP) to avoid artefacts due to platelet activation. Therefore, blood
is submitted to a first centrifugation at low speed (~1500  g) to
eliminate red blood cells and leukocytes, and to a second centrifugation
at high speed (~13,000  g) to eliminate platelets. Plateletfree
plasma samples are rapidly frozen and stored at 80C until
analysis. However, certain authors consider the supernatant of
whole blood centrifuged at low speed as PFP [32, 33].
The blood collection and sample processing methods have a
strong impact on qualitative and quantitative MP analysis. The
specific conditions used to analyse MPs in PFP vary considerably
among research laboratories and standardization is crucial for MP
assays to be useful for clinical diagnosis [34]. Pre-analytical variables
relate to the venipuncture method by which the sample is
obtained, the anti-coagulant used, the centrifugation speed to
obtain PFP and finally whether the samples are analysed fresh or
after freezing. Examples of protocols for plasma preparation
before MP analysis in different cardiovascular clinical studies are
summarized in Table 1.
Microparticle isolation from tissues and fluids
In the cardiovascular system, MPs are present within the atherosclerotic
plaques where they constitute the main reservoir for 
TF activity, promoting coagulation after plaque erosion and
 rupture [35]. Moreover, plaque MPs, harbouring proteolytic,
angiogenic and inflammatory effectors, are potential actors in
plaque vulnerability and lesion complications. Microparticles
have been extracted from atherosclerotic plaques for qualitative
and quantitative analysis. For these studies, MPs are extracted
after tissue homogenization and centrifugation to eliminate tissular
and cellular debris, followed by successive centrifugations to
obtain MPs [35, 36]. Microparticles have also been isolated by
successive centrifugation steps from synovial and vitreous fluid
from patients with inflammatory arthritis or diabetes [37, 38]. In
mice, MPs have also been isolated from ischaemic muscle, 
atherosclerotic plaques and liver after homogenization and successive
centrifugations [39, 40].
Microparticle generation and isolation from cells in culture
To assess the pathophysiological properties of MPs in vitro, several
studies have relied on the use of MPs obtained ex vivo from
patient’s blood. However, due to the limited amounts of MPs
obtained ex vivo, many studies have used cells in culture treated
with inflammatory or apoptotic stimuli to produce MPs in large
quantities.
Cell lines display different sensitivities to apoptotic or inflammatory
stimuli and thus differ in their ability to generate MPs.
The most often used cell lines are human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) and Jurkat cells (human lymphoid cells).
Obviously, MPs can be produced and generated from all cell
types. As previously mentioned (see section ‘Microparticle composition
and structure’), numerous stimuli can be used to generate
MP in vitro. In brief, MP-containing supernatant of treated
cells is  collected and centrifuged, once at low speed (~1500  g)
to eliminate cells and once at high speed (~20,000  g) to 
pellet MPs. The MP pellet is recovered, generally in saline buffer
 solution, aliquoted and stored at 80C before use. It is of
importance to note that several authors used pellets obtained
after centrifugation to 100,000  g, a speed at which both MPs
and exosomes (vesicles between 40 and 90 nm of diameter
which do not bind annexin V) sediment [41]. Table 2 presents
representative examples of protocols used to obtain MP preparations
from cells in vitro.

Qualitative and quantitative MP analysis
Microparticles can be measured using various methods and combinations
thereof. Unfortunately, the analysis protocols are not standardized
yet, rendering quantitative and/or qualitative MP analysis
reported by different research laboratories difficult to compare.
Flow cytometry
The usual criteria to detect and quantify MPs by flow cytometry
include sizes lower than 1 m, and PS positivity, which is detected
by binding of fluorescent labelled annexin V. Other criteria can be
included both for quantitative and qualitative analyses such as
expression of antigens characteristic of the cell of origin. For each
cell type, various markers can be used and the choice differs considerably
among laboratories. Moreover, as discussed in section
‘Pre-analytical treatment of plasma’, antigen distribution can differ
between cell surface and MP surface. The most commonly used
antigens are listed in Table 3. These criteria provide information
about the presence of antigens at the surface, but not on their
functionality. For example, TF may be detected on MPs using specific
antibodies, but this does not indicate whether this TF is functionally
active.
One major limit of flow cytometry is the detection of very small
size MPs (less than 0.5 m), not always feasible with the cytometers
currently used. Particles with size inferior to the wavelength
of the laser light used for detection may be undetectable.
Therefore, there has been recent interest to apply other physical
methods allowing detection of MPs with a higher sensitivity, such
as novel generation cytometers (NAVIOS, which allow detection of
particles with sizes more than 300 nm, and Apogee A50, which
allow detection of particles with sizes more than 100 nm) or

atomic force microscopy. However, these novel technologies are
still in their infancy and further studies are needed to develop a
gold standard method providing analysis of concentrations, size
distribution and cellular origin. Interestingly, a very recent study,
using SYTO 13, a fluorescent dye binding nucleic acids, used
nucleic acids as parameter to detect MPs, which allowed identification
of MPs with sizes less than 200 nm [25].
Although it is commonly accepted that MPs expose PS, which
is detected by annexin V labelling, some studies have identified
vesicles expressing specific markers of cellular origin, in the size
range of MPs but not binding to annexin V [5–8]. Existence of MPs
which do not expose PS is under debate. If such vesicles are considered
to be MPs, measurement techniques involving annexin V
binding (flow cytometry and ELISA assays) may not allow quantification
of total MPs.
ELISA assays
ELISA is another method used to detect MPs. A 96-well microplate
is coated with annexin V or with an antibody of interest for MP
detection. After washing, a mix containing prothrombin, factor Xa,
factor Va and calcium is introduced in the wells. PS on the MP surface
allows activation of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence
of factor Xa and factor Va. The generated amount of thrombin is
measured with a specific chromogenic substrate [42].
Another method involves TF exposure on MPs. After MP fixation
on annexin V–coated plates and washing, MPs exposing TF
are revealed using a TF antibody coupled with peroxidase [43].
The advantages of ELISA are, first, the analysis of small MPs,
not detectable with flow cytometry, and, second, the possibility of
higher throughput than with flow cytometry. However, a particular
attention should be paid to the MP preparation method, because
ELISA does not include size as a criterion of measurement. ELISA
thus does not allow discrimination of MPs from contaminating
cells, exosomes or apoptotic bodies. Moreover, this method does
not assess the concentration of MPs, but only quantifies PS content
in the sample.
Microparticles as markers 
of cardiovascular diseases
Microparticles are detectable in plasma of healthy individuals. A
large variation in the number and/or the type of MPs in terms of
cell origin is observed in several pathologies associated 
with inflammation. Among them, cardiovascular diseases are of
particular interest, because MPs may constitute interesting
 disease  biomarkers.
Several studies have shown an association between the
Framingham risk score, used to predict cardiovascular disease
risk, and plasma concentrations of MPs from diverse cellular origins
(leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells) [44–46]. Addition
of endothelial-derived MPs as parameter to the Framingham risk
score model improved the prediction power of future cardiovascular
events [46].
Correlations between MP concentrations in plasma and
lifestyle factors increasing cardiovascular risk have been reported
in several studies. Ingestion of two consecutive high-fat meals,
separated by 4 hrs, which impairs endothelial function, increased
oxidative stress and MP concentrations in young healthy men
[31]. Passive smoking also alters endothelial function and
increases endothelial cell MP concentrations [47].
Microparticle concentrations are also associated with features
of the metabolic syndrome. Patients with hypertension have
 elevated levels of endothelial, platelet and monocyte MPs as compared
to normotensive patients [33, 48]. In these patients,
endothelial MP concentrations correlate strongly with systolic
and diastolic blood pressure [33]. Obese women, without specific
cardiovascular risk factors, displayed increased plasma MP concentrations
, which correlated positively with body mass index
(BMI) [49]. MP concentrations are elevated in type 1 and type 2
diabetic patients, but these patients display different patterns of
MPs. In type 1 diabetes, total, platelet- and endothelial-derived
MPs, displaying enhanced pro-coagulant activity, are elevated
and correlate with HbA(1c) levels [50]. In type 2 diabetic patients,
total MP concentrations are increased, but these MPs do not
show enhanced pro-coagulant activity. Another study found a
correlation of TF-exposing MPs with BMI, glycaemia, insulinemia
and an inverse correlation with HDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic
patients [51].
Increased concentrations of leukocyte-derived MPs correlate
with the inflammatory marker CRP and metabolic syndrome features
as well as the presence of atherosclerotic plaques detected
by ultrasound analysis in asymptomatic patients [52]. Increased
levels of endothelial CD144

MP were observed in type 2 diabetic
patients with non-calcified plaques [32]. Several studies have
shown an increase of endothelial and platelet MPs in patients with
acute coronary syndrome [53–55] or venous embolism [56].
Patients with peripheral arterial disease have increased plateletderived
MPs exposing P-selectin [54]. Correlations between MP
concentrations and clinical parameters have been observed, such
as between MPs exposing CD31 and coronary artery endothelial
function in patients with CAD [57]. These results identify MPs as
promising markers of cardiovascular diseases. Finally, it has been
reported that MPs of distinct origin than those found in blood are
detectable in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a local cell production
of specific MPs [35]. MPs are more abundant in atherosclerotic
plaques than in the blood, and present a more pronounced
prothrombogenic activity [35].

several properties that can contribute to vascular disease initiation
, progression and its clinical complications. Most studies
analysing the biological effects of MPs in atherogenesis and its
complications have been performed in vitro, using MPs produced
in vitro from cells treated with inflammatory or apoptotic stimuli,
or isolated ex vivo from blood or atherosclerotic plaques. The
properties of these MPs are pleiotropic, and we report here a nonexhaustive
list of these effects. It is noteworthy that MP properties
highly differ according to two parameters: the cell type of origin
and the stimulus used to generate them.
Microparticles in endothelial function 
and angiogenesis
Microparticles have different effects on endothelial cell function
and angiogenesis depending on their cell of origin. Microparticles
isolated from patients with myocardial infarction, as well as a mixture
of MPs and exosomes from rat renal microvascular endothelial
cells (RMVEC) which bear the NADPH oxidase p22(phox) subunit
, impair vasorelaxation of rat aortic rings, associated with a
reduction of nitric oxide (NO) production and an increased of
superoxide anion production [58, 59]. Microparticles produced by
treatment of T lymphocytes with the apoptotic agent actinomycin
D increase the production of reactive oxygen species and decrease
NO synthesis in Eahy 926 endothelial cells. This occurs via the
phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases
(ERK1/2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [60]. However,
MPs produced by treatment of the same T cell line with phytohaemagglutinin
, phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate and actinomycin
D bear sonic hedgehog, thus inducing NO production and enhancing
vasorelaxation depending also on the PI3K/ERK pathway [61].
Microparticles isolated from metabolic syndrome patients reduce
NO production and impair endothelium-dependent relaxation
when injected intravenously in mice probably via decreased
endothelial NO synthase expression, decreased expression of the
NADPH oxidase p47(phox) subunit in MPs and increased expression
of superoxide dismutase in endothelial cells [62].
Endothelial MPs produced in vitro from HUVEC inhibit human
mitral valve endothelial cell proliferation by modulating growth
factor fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth
factor signalling, whereas they stimulate HUVEC proliferation
[63]. Microparticles isolated from human atherosclerotic
plaques also increase HUVEC proliferation, via interaction of
CD40 ligand on MPs and CD40 on endothelial cells [64]. A mixture
of MPs and exosomes from HUVEC inhibit angiogenesis,
whereas a mixture of MPs and exosomes from platelets promote
angiogenesis in an in vitro Matrigel test using HUVEC [65, 66].
Moreover, MPs from platelets promote angiogenesis ex vivo
on rat aortic rings [67]. Circulating MPs from mice increase
bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell differentiation,
pro-angiogenic gene expression in vitro and angiogenesis in
vivo, in a peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor  (PPAR-)–
dependent manner [68].
Microparticles in inflammation
As inflammation is an important contributor to atherogenesis, the
effects of MPs on inflammatory processes have been investigated
in detail.
An important step of atherogenesis involves adhesion of circulating
monocytes on the vascular endothelium. A mixture of MPs
and exosomes from platelets increase endothelial cell ICAM-1 and
the adhesion of monocytic U937 cells to HUVEC [69]. However,
MPs released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes bear annexin I,
which inhibits the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial
cells, a potentially anti-atherogenic effect [70].
Several studies show a role for MPs in stimulating pro-inflammatory
cytokine production in vitro by endothelial cells (IL-6,
MCP-1, iNOS, COX-2), via activation of the JNK1 and NF-B pathways
[71, 72], and by monocytes (TNF, interleukin-1	 (IL-1	) and
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)) [73]. Arachidonic acid
released from platelet-derived MPs increases COX-2 and ICAM-1
expression in endothelial cells, and COX-2 expression in monocytes via induction of protein kinase C (PKC) translocation from
the cytosol to the membrane [74, 75].
Aminophospholipids located on the MP membrane can also
enhance inflammation. These aminophospholipids are substrates
of phospholipase A2, which catalyses the synthesis of lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA), a mediator of inflammation [76].
Finally, MPs produced from Jurkat cells enhance MP production
by a mouse macrophage cell line, which may exacerbate the
inflammatory process [77].
Microparticles in thrombosis
PS and TF exposed on the MP surface are potent promotors of
blood coagulation. PS exposure allows the assembly of the
 prothrombinase and tenase complexes. Monocyte MPs are a
source of active TF which promotes thrombin generation via
factor VII in vitro [78]. These MPs can fuse with the platelet
membrane, transferring TF to the surface of platelets thus
allowing thrombin formation [79]. MPs from pericardial blood
of cardiac surgery patients promote thrombogenesis in vivo in
rats via their TF activity [80]. Moreover, MPs can promote
 coagulation not only by exposition of TF and PS, but also by
modulation of TF expression, as shown in human monocytic
THP-1 cells [81].
P-selectin seems to play a crucial role in the effect of MPs on
thrombosis. Indeed, interaction between platelet P-selectin and its
ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 on MPs contributes to
thrombus development in mice [82]. P-selectin can also exacerbate
the coagulation process by inducing MP formation, as shown
in transgenic mice expressing high levels of soluble P-selectin
which display elevated blood MP concentrations [83].
In conclusion, the roles of MPs in coagulation are multiple. By
these properties, they can exacerbate thrombosis, and potentially
precipitate the clinical complications of atherosclerosis.

Pharmacological modulation 
of plasma MP concentrations
Microparticles concentrations are elevated in patients with cardiovascular
risk factors and disease. Moreover, MPs may
actively modulate the process of atherogenesis. Therefore,
measurement of MPs may be of pharmacological interest as
activity markers in early clinical development or as efficacy
markers in cardiovascular risk patients. A number of studies
have reported the effect of certain drugs, used to decrease CV
risk, on MP concentrations, suggesting that the beneficial effects
of these drugs could, at least in part, be mediated via a reduction
of MP concentrations.
Statins
Statins are hypolipidaemic drugs, which decrease plasma cholesterol
concentrations (especially cholesterol in the highly atherogenic
LDL fraction) by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, the ratelimiting
enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Numerous clinical studies
have shown beneficial effects of statins in cardiovascular disease
prevention, not only by reducing cholesterol, but possibly also via
their effects on endothelial function, vascular inflammation and
platelet aggregation (for review, see Ref. [84]). Several studies
show that statins reduce MP concentrations or modify their 
composition.
Association of simvastatin with losartan, an angiotensin II
receptor antagonist used in the treatment of hypertension,
decreased monocyte-, endothelial- and platelet-MP concentrations
in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes [85, 86].
Pravastatin treatment for 8 weeks reduced fibrinogen receptor
gpIIIa on platelet MPs in type 2 diabetes patients [87]. This
receptor for fibrinogen plays an important role in thrombus
 formation and is present in platelet MPs, where its concentration
depends on the stimulus which has induced MP formation.
Reduction of this receptor on MPs could decrease thrombus
 formation and contribute to decreased cardiovascular events in
diabetic patients. In patients displaying hyperlipidaemia and 
type 2 diabetes, pitavastatin alone did not reduce platelet MP
concentrations in plasma. However, association with eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA), a fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects
[88], reduced platelet MPs to a larger extent than EPA alone [89].
Atorvastatin treatment (2 months) of patients with type 1
 diabetes and dyslipidaemia reduced gpIIIa-, P-selectin- and 
TF-containing MPs [90].
These in vivo lowering effects of statins on circulating MPs
could be, at least in part, explained by their anti-inflammatory
properties. Moreover, it has been shown that fluvastatin prevents
TNF-induced MP production by human coronary artery
endothelial cells, by inhibiting the Rho kinase pathway which is
involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and thus in MP formation
[91].
Anti-oxidants
Oxidative stress triggers numerous deleterious processes in
 atherosclerosis, leading to endothelial dysfunction and platelet
activation. A reduction of circulating MP levels by anti-oxidant
treatment could reflect an improvement of endothelial function
and a reduction of platelet activation. Interestingly, one study
analysing the effects of treatment with vitamin C for 5 days has
reported a decrease of endothelial and platelet MPs in diabetic and
dyslipidaemic patients [92].
Peroxisome proliferator–activated 
receptor activators
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors are ligand-activated
nuclear receptors regulating the expression of genes implicated in
lipid and glucose metabolism, and inflammation. PPAR- and
PPAR-
 agonists are used in clinical practice to improve dyslipidaemia
and type 2 diabetes, respectively [93, 94]. The PPAR-

agonist pioglitazone reduced circulating endothelial MPs in patients
with metabolic syndrome, independent of its effects on insulin sensitivity
[95]. Another study reported that treatment with bezafibrate,
a PPAR-pan agonist, which lowers plasma lipid concentrations and
coagulation parameters such as fibrinogen, reduced plateletderived
MPs in patients with connective tissue diseases and secondary
hyperlipidaemia caused by steroid treatment [96].
Pharmacological regulation of MPs has been studied mostly in
human beings. Very recently, we used the apoE2KI mouse model
of atherosclerosis as a preclinical pharmacological model to test
the effects of PPAR- activation on MP concentrations [40]. Our
results showed that fenofibrate decreases MPs in atherosclerotic
lesion as well as circulating MPs in a PPAR-–dependent manner.
This effect could be due to the anti-inflammatory properties of
fenofibrate, which could decrease MP production.
Conclusion
This review summarized the current knowledge identifying cellderived
MPs as actors and/or markers in cardiovascular diseases.
It is now increasingly admitted that MPs may contribute
to the  initiation, progression and clinical complications of this
pathology. Further studies are needed to better delineate the
pathophysiological properties of MPs. Second, MPs appear
interesting biomarkers to predict cardiovascular disease risk.
Nevertheless, numerous issues remain to be addressed before
MP measurement can be applied as routine biological tests to
improve cardiovascular risk prediction of patients, and the efficacy
of pharmacological interventions. A biomarker test needs to
comply different requirements, such as (1) facility to obtain
patient samples in which the biomarker can be easily measured,

(2) existence of a sensitive and reproducible assay involving a
methodology applicable in numerous laboratories, with a cost
per assay compatible with large-scale application, (3) providing
additional information on the cardiovascular risk over the known
risk factors (i.e. age, sex, LDL-cholesterol, etc.) or identifying
patients at risk earlier than with the classical risk factors.
Prospective studies showing the predictive value of MPs in
pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, are needed to
demonstrate whether these biomarkers will be useful in the early
detection of disease and its progression.
To conclude, MPs can be considered as actors in atherosclerosis,
and may become potentially interesting biomarkers in the future
pending technological developments allowing easy and reproducible
measurement.
