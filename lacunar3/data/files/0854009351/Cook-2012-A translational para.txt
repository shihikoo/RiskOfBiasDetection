NEUROLOGY
A Translational Paradigm for the Preclinical Evaluation
of the Stroke Neuroprotectant Tat-NR2B9c in
Gyrencephalic Nonhuman Primates
Douglas J. Cook,1 Lucy Teves,1 Michael Tymianski1,2,3,4*
Over decades, all attempts to translate acute stroke neuroprotectants from discovery in lower-order species to human
clinical use have failed. This raised concerns about the predictive validity of preclinical studies in animals for
outcomes in human stroke trials. To bridge this translational gap, we used high-order gyrencephalic nonhuman
primates subjected to an experimental protocol that mimicked that of a corresponding, separately reported, clinical
trial in which the human subjects underwent endovascular cerebral aneurysm repair. Both placebo-controlled
studies tested neuroprotection by Tat-NR2B9c, a prospective therapeutic compound, in anesthetized subjects.
Embolic strokes were produced by small intra-arterial emboli caused by the endovascular procedure. We show that
primates treated with Tat-NR2B9c after the onset of embolic strokes exhibited significantly reduced numbers and
volumes of strokes, as visualized by diffusion- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. These results correctly
anticipated the outcome of the corresponding human trial, thus validating this study design as a predictor of neuroprotective
efficacy in humans. This strategy may facilitate the evaluation of promising neuroprotectants before
undertaking similar studies in human subjects.
INTRODUCTION
Despite the massive worldwide socioeconomic toll of stroke, there
exists only one widely approved acute stroke therapy: early reperfusion
of blocked cerebral arteries with thrombolytic agents such as
recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (1, 2). However,
only a small proportion of stroke victims qualify for thrombolysis
treatment because of the potential for hemorrhagic complications.
Neuroprotection, an alternative strategy to reperfusion, aims to pharmacologically
enhance the resilience of the brain to ischemic insults.
A safe neuroprotectant could increase the proportion of patients who
would benefit from acute stroke treatment, but decades of research
have failed to translate more than 1000 experimental neuroprotective
therapies from discovery in cells and rodents to clinical use in humans
(3–5). Thus, there currently are no treatments that enhance the human
brain’s resilience to ischemia, leaving an unexplained translational gap
between animal experiments and human trials.
Many past animal studies were criticized for deficiencies in quality
(6, 7). Others may have met high scientific standards, and yet efficacy in
animal studies to date did not predict human efficacy. Consequently,
additional reasons for failures in translating stroke therapies from rodents
to humans have been proposed (8,9). Chief among these is the possibility
that there exist essential biological, physiological, or anatomical differences
between the brains of lower-order species such as rodents and those
of humans (10, 11). Another possibility is that studies of promising neuroprotectants
have been performed under highly controlled and stringent
laboratory conditions, but when these agents progressed to clinical trials,
such conditions could not be faithfullyreproduced,asbothpatientsand
stroke syndromes were highly heterogeneous. Thus, experimental paradigms
in animals were not predictive of the human situation.
Our goal was to create a paradigm for evaluating neuroprotectants
in animals that would be predictive of efficacy in humans. To this end,
we selected the neuroprotectant Tat-NR2B9c, a promising compound
that uncouples postsynaptic density-95 protein (PSD-95) from neurotoxic
signaling pathways (12–15). Under controlled laboratory conditions
, this agent reduces stroke damage produced by experimental
middle cerebral artery occlusion in rodents (12, 14–16) and in primates
(17). However, the stringent conduct of such studies could be
challenging to reproduce in human clinical stroke trials because of the
heterogeneityofstrokesandofstrokepatients.
To address the biological gap between rodents and higher-order species
and the gaps between laboratory and clinical trial designs, we used
cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) because these gyrencephalic
nonhuman primates bear genetic, anatomical, and behavioral similarities
to humans (18, 19). The animals participated in an experimental
embolic stroke study modeled after the design of ENACT (Evaluating
NeuroprotectioninAneurysmCoilingTherapy),ahumanclinicaltrial
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00728182) (20). ENACT evaluated whether
Tat-NR2B9c could reduce the anatomical burden of embolic strokes
sustained by patients undergoing endovascular repair of an intracranial
aneurysm. In more than 90% of such patients, after the procedure, DWI
[diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] reveals small
ischemic strokes caused by emboli released during the intravascular manipulation
(21). As such, these subjects make up a population in which
small, uniform, embolic strokes occur with high predictability in a
controlled environment. We conducted our primate study concurrently
with ENACT to test whether it would predict the benefits of Tat-NR2B9c
in humans. In both the ENACT trial and this study, humans and primates
were subjected to general anesthesia, rigorous control of physiological
parameters, randomization, allocation concealment, and blinded assessment
of all outcomes (11). All were subjected to a procedure that
produced similar embolic strokes, were similarly treated with a neuroprotectant
or placebo, and were similarly evaluated.
In strokes caused by occlusion of larger cerebral vessels, a collateral
supply is responsible for the ischemic penumbra, an area of reduced

blood flow adjacent to the ischemic core. Because the penumbra maintains
some blood flow, the rate of tissue damage is reduced and viable
tissue may be potentially salvageable if an effective treatment is given
(22). However, little is known about whether a penumbra exists in
strokes caused by small emboli lodged in terminal cerebral arterioles.
It is plausible that such emboli could produce severely ischemic areas
that are devoid of a collateral blood supply. Ischemic areas without a
penumbra, produced in humans undergoing endovascular aneurysm
repair, may not respond to therapies designed to confer neuroprotection.
Thus, our preclinical study examined the feasibility of ameliorating
, in the primate brain, tissue pathology caused by ischemia produced
by small emboli similar to those incurred by humans who undergo endovascular
aneurysm repair.
RESULTS
Stroke model development
To simulate in primates the strokes that patients incur during endovascular
aneurysm repair, we subjected anesthetized animals to an intracarotid
injection of polystyrene spheres. We selected polystyrene
instead of autologous blood particles, such as those previously used
by Zivin and colleagues (23) in rabbits, because polystyrene spheres
have uniform diameters and would be anticipated to produce strokes
of a uniform size. The spheres produced small ischemic strokes that
were visualized by DWI and T2-weighted MRI and resulted in clear
histopathologicalstrokes(Fig.1andfig.S1).WeusedbothDWIand
T2 imaging because DWI provides for imaging of the cytotoxic edema
that arises within minutes in new ischemic lesions, whereas T2 imaging
visualizes tissue necrosis butmay not distinguish between new and
preexisting lesions (24).
We evaluated the strokes produced by injecting polystyrene microspheres
of 100-, 200-, and 400-mm diameters (Polysciences Inc.).
Five male macaques, different individuals from those used in the
main study, were subjected to a single injection of microspheres followed
by a 2- to 4-week washout period according to the following
sequence: ten 100-mm spheres, twenty 100-mm spheres, ten 200-mm
spheres, and ten 400-mm spheres. The sequence was carried out for
each animal until an injection produced a neurological deficit that
did not resolve completely during the washout period or the animal
sustained a stroke in a major vascular territory. When either of these
situations was encountered, the animal was anesthetized and perfused,
and the brain was sectioned and stained.
Four animals underwent the full sequence of four iterations of
increasing diameter emboli, and one underwent three iterations, for
a total of 19 procedures. The latter animal was euthanized after severe
neurological deficits were encountered with the final injection of 400-mm
spheres. Emboli in higher numbers and of larger diameter produced
increasing numbers and volumes of strokes in the brain as a whole
(Fig.2,AandB)andinthecerebralcortex(Fig.2,CandD).Overall,
the injection of twenty 100-mm spheres produced the largest number
andvolumeofstrokes(Fig.2,AtoD)having an appearance similar to
that sustained by humans who undergo endovascular aneurysm repair
(Fig.2,EtoH,andfig.S4).
To mimic the clinical situation, we selected an ischemic insult
produced by the number and diameter of spheres that did not produce
persistent neurological impairment. Neurological scoring was
conducted at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days after the procedure with
the nonhuman primate stroke scale (NHPSS; Fig. 3) (25). The NHPSS
is a validated 11-item scale analogous to the human National Institutes
of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale (26). This revealed that the smallest

particles were associated with minimal, transient neurological deficits
, a finding most consistent with that of humans who undergo
an uncomplicated endovascular aneurysm repair procedure. The
injection of 400-mm spheres resulted in severe neurological
impairments because such spheres caused ischemia
in the basal ganglia and internal capsule (Fig. 3).
Animals that received injections of 200-mm spheres had
lasting mild deficits, whereas animals that received ten
or twenty 100-mm spheres returned to baseline behavioral
scores by 24 hours.
The protocol that produced the most embolic strokes
without producing severe neurological deficits was the
injection of twenty 100-mm spheres. This generated an
average of 11 ± 2 strokes with an average aggregate volumeof43
± 7mm 3. Qualitatively, these strokes corresponded
in appearance, relative size, and location to
ischemic lesions sustained by patients undergoing aneurysm
repair (fig. S2, A to D). The strokes were most evident
on DWI at 24 hours and persisted on T2 imaging at
2 weeks despite resolution of the DWI hyperintensity
(Fig. 4).
The study flow chart of the primate experiment and
that of the ENACT trial are provided in fig. S3. We
conducted all experiments with allocation concealment
and blinded assessment of all outcomes. The outcome
measures of primary interest were the same as those of
the ENACT trial: the total number and total volume of
infarcts in the brain, as determined by MRI. Secondary
outcomes of interest were the number and volume of
strokes in different brain regions, specifically the cortical
mantle, the deep brain nuclei (basal ganglia and thalamus
), and the cerebral white matter (fig. S2, E and F).
All procedures, including MRI scans, were conducted
under general anesthesia.
A blinded crossover study of Tat-NR2B9c
We randomized 10 male macaques to receive a 10-min
intravenous infusion of Tat-NR2B9c (2.6 mg/kg) or
placebo (0.9% saline) diluted in 5 ml of saline, beginning
at 1 hour after completion of the embolic procedure.
The embolic procedure lasted about 1 hour and
consisted of a femoral catheter cerebral angiogram (Fig.
1A) and the intracarotid injection of twenty 100-mm
polystyrene spheres. The interval after treatment was
selected to reproduce the timing of drug infusion for
the ENACT trial, in which drug or placebo was administered
at the end of the interventional aneurysm repair
procedure. Such procedures last 2 hours on average.
Drug was administered after the surgical procedure because
both this study and the ENACT trial were designed
to determine whether neuroprotection is possible after
a stroke had occurred in a clinically relevant setting.
We used the same dose of Tat-NR2B9c as in the human
trial (2.6 mg/kg) (20), a dose known to be protective
in nonhuman primates subjected to stroke by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (17). The animals remained
anesthetized until after the 4-hour DWI scan.
They were then awakened and allowed to recover. A
second DWI and T2 MRI scan was conducted at 24 hours, and a final
T2 scan was conducted on day 30. Neurological scoring by NHPSS
was undertaken at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days to ensure that the

animals had recovered. After the 4-week washout period, each
animal was crossed over to the opposite treatment group, and
the entire study protocol was repeated. This was possible because
of the lack of neurological impairment in this model (Fig. 3) and
because, by 4 weeks, the DWI signal produced by the strokes subsides
(Fig. 4). This time course permits the tracking of new and old
strokes to enable a single animal to undergo multiple iterations of
the embolic procedure. Reusing the same animals minimizes the
number of animals and costs. We maintained blinding at crossover:
Individuals conducting the experiment had no knowledge of the
animal’s initial treatment or whether they would be assigned to
the opposite treatment. At completion of the second 30-day observation
period, the animals were anesthetized, and the brains were
removed and processed for histopathological analysis.
Effect of treatment with Tat-NR2B9c on embolic strokes
All 10 animals completed the first iteration of the protocol. On the
second iteration, three animals were lost: one because of an air embolus
(placebo animal), one because of a postoperative aspiration
(placebo animal), and one because of a cardiac arrest at the induction
of anesthesia but preceding surgery and dosing with Tat-
NR2B9c. Consequently, MRI data and neurological scores were
available for eight treatments with placebo and nine treatments
with Tat-NR2B9c.
There were no differences in physiological parameters between
groups (Table 1). The strokes did not cause lasting gross motor deficits,
and there were no differences between drug- and placebo-treated
groups on neurological scoring with the NHPSS, showing that all
animals returned to baseline neurological function within 36 hours
of the embolic procedure (Table 2).
Animals treated with Tat-NR2B9c exhibited a marked reduction
in both the numbers and the volumes of strokes when compared
with placebo-treated animals (Fig. 5 and Table 3). At 24 hours after
drug treatment, the number of strokes as detected by DWI in placebo
animals was 12.75 ± 0.41 as compared with 4.67 ± 0.47 lesions
in animals treated with Tat-NR2B9c (a 64% reduction; Student’s ttest,
P < 0.001). T2-weighted MRI revealed similar effects, with placeboand
drug-treated animals exhibiting 10.50 ± 1.26 and 3.78 ± 0.32 lesions
, respectively (also a 64% reduction; Student’s t test, P < 0.001).
Infarction volumes were also significantly reduced in both MRI measures
(56% by DWI and 60% by T2-weighted imaging; Table 3).
The 24-hour DWI of animals treated with placebo showed that
71% of the emboli lodged preferentially in the cerebral cortex (8.88 ±
0.48 cortical emboli by 24-hour DWI of a total of 12.75 ± 0.41; Table 3),
27% distributed to the deep nuclei, and 4% to the white matter. The
average number of strokes in the white matter was 0.5 per animal,
making subgroup analyses of white matter strokes underpowered to
test for treatment effects. However, there were significant reductions
in the numbers of strokes as gauged by DWI and T2 MRI in the
deep nuclei; the volume analysis trended in the same direction
but was not significant (Table 3). The effects were most pronounced
in the cortex, in which the large number of lesions provided the
most statistical power to reveal differences between the groups. In
the cortex, treatment with Tat-NR2B9c reduced the number of strokes
on the 24-hour DWI and T2-weighted MRI by about 80 and 75%,
respectively (Student’s t test, P < 0.001 each). Volume analyses revealed
similar effects (Table 3; Student’s t test, P = 0.002 and P =
0.006 for DWI and T2, respectively).
By 30 days, DWI hyperintensities that were visible on the 24-hour
MRI were no longer present in any of the animals, consistent with the
expected duration of a DWI signal of a few days (27). However, the T2
abnormalities, representing the anatomical consequence of ischemia,
persisted and exhibited similar reductions in the number and volume
of infarcts in the animals treated with Tat-NR2B9c as compared with
placebo (Table 3). These results suggest that the effects of treatment
are persistent ratherthantransient.
After sacrifice of the animals, we confirmed that the strokes detected
by MRI were congruent with areas of brain tissue necrosis by
histology. Twenty representative coronal brain sections were selected
from five animals (four sections per animal). A total of 48 areas of
necrosis were observed, of which 45 could be directly related to the
infarcts initially detected on DWI (for example, Fig. 1). By contrast,
in the 20 analyzed sections, there were no areas that contained DWI
hyperintensities that did not correspond to a site of histological brain
tissue necrosis. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in detecting
histological lesions were 93.8 and 100%, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The present study revealed that strokes incurred by small emboli in
terminal brain arterioles were amenable to neuroprotection in the highorder
gyrencephalic brains of old-world primates. This raises the prospect
that such small strokes may have a penumbra, even if it is too small to be
detectable by current MRI. Our results predicted that ENACT, the
corresponding human trial (20), should also demonstrate detectable
neuroprotectionwithTat-NR2B9cinhumans.Themagnitudeofthetreatment
effect seen in our study, a 50 to 60% reduction in the numbers and
volumes of new infarcts as detectable by MRI, was instrumental in the
sample size calculations for subject enrollment in ENACT (20).

The results of ENACT are reported elsewhere
(20). However, the present study is
unique not only by virtue of its design but
also in that it provides the first paradigm
for animal stroke research whose predictions
have been validated in a multicenter, randomized
, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
human clinical trial. As such, this experimental
approach may represent a valid
translational step between stroke studies
in rodents and humans and may be beneficial
in evaluating neuroprotectants other
than Tat-NR2B9c.
A theoretical limitation of the present
experimental design was that it focused
on small embolic strokes that were not
anticipated to produce gross sensorimotor
deficits and, therefore, that it is of uncertain
clinical relevance. Although our primary
goal was to validate a preclinical strategy
that might predict the outcome of a proofof-concept
study in humans, there are ample
theoretical and evidence-based arguments
in support of a clinical relevance of our
study. First, small embolic strokes such as
those we have modeled here occur in multiple
clinical scenarios, including cardiopulmonary
bypass (28), carotid endarterectomy
or stenting (29), and various endovascular
procedures (21, 30). Although most do
not cause gross deficits, many have been
shown to cause neurocognitive impairment
(28, 31). These findings arise at a time
when an increasing body of literature has
also recognized the interplay between small
strokes and the increasing societal burden
of neurovascular dementias (32). Thus,
the potential of a neuroprotective therapy
to reduce the cumulative burden of even
small strokes may have profound clinical
significance. This argument is bolstered by
the fact that, in the ENACT trial, enrolled
patients with ruptured brain aneurysms

who were randomized to the treatment
arm with Tat-NR2B9c exhibited improved
clinical outcomes. This provides strong support
that even small strokes are associated
with clinical consequences, whether they
serve as a biomarker for the severity of
disease or are causally responsible for
the neurological condition. Thus, the experimental
preclinical paradigm we have
provided may be justified as a preamble
both for proof-of-concept studies in humans
and for predicting potential clinical
benefit.

were monitored throughout and maintained within normal physiological

On the basis of pilot experiments, the sample size determinations
were based on the desire to detect a 40% difference in infarct volumes
between drug and placebo based on the final DWI at a power of 0.8,a=
0.05, and an assumed SD of 30% of group means, yielding 10 subjects

of the internal carotid artery under fluoroscopic guidance. A baseline
digital subtraction angiogram was obtained by injecting 2 ml of
Visipaque (320 mg/ml) via the microcatheter under continuous fluoroscopy.
Embolic particles (polystyrene microspheres; Polysciences
Inc.) were injected in 3 ml of 0.9% saline solution followed by a 10-ml
0.9% saline flush. Polystyrene particles were consistently sized, were stable
when introduced into the bloodstream, and had a lower specific gravity
than blood, permitting transport with the blood flow. A second angiogram
was performed after the injection of emboli to confirm patency
of the major vessels and persistence of the catheter placement in the internal
carotid artery. Upon termination of anesthesia, animals recovered
in the home cage with heat lamps, access to water and soft foods, and
constant supervision for the first 48 hours to ensure that perching and
self-carewereattained.
Magnetic resonance imaging
At 4 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days after the embolic procedure, anesthetized
animals were positioned prone in a cylindrical bed and imaged
in a 7-T Bruker BioSpec MRI. Stacks of axial T2- and diffusion-weighted
(three orthogonal diffusion directions at b =1000s/mm 2)imageswere
obtained. Diffusion-weighted images were post-processed with MATLAB
to produce average diffusion-weighted images from the three directions
obtained.
Assessment of strokes
Hyperintense regions corresponding to new strokes on DWI performed
at 4 and 24 hours were identified, and regions of interest (ROIs) were
traced around each lesion. The numbers of ROIs were counted, and
their volumes were calculated by multiplying by MRI slice thickness.
Counts and volumes were calculated separately for the cerebral cortex,
white matter, and deep gray nuclei (fig. S2), and these values were added
together to provide total counts and stroke volumes. Hyperintense regions
on T2-weighted images at 24 hours and at 30 days were analyzed
similarly. Neurological scoring with the NHPSS (25)wasperformedat8,
12, 24, 36, and 72 hours and 2 and 4 weeks after the embolic stroke. The
NHPSS is a validated 11-item scale analogous to the human NIH Stroke
Scale (26). NHPSS scores range from 0 to 41, with a higher score indicating
greater stroke severity. On day 30, the animals were anesthetized
and subjected to transcardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline
under deep anesthesia (5% isoflurane in oxygen via endotracheal tube).
Table 3. Primary and secondary analyses of MRI outcomes measured at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days after treatment. All P values represent the results
of a two-tailed Student’s t test. T2 imaging was not carried out at 4 hours, and DWI was not analyzed for the 30-day scans because of the absence of DWI
abnormalities at that time point.
