Expression of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-
phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and its roles in
activated microglia in vivo and in vitro
Lijuan Yang1†, Enci Mary Kan2†, Jia Lu2, Chunyun Wu3 and Eng-Ang Ling4*
Abstract
Background: We reported previously that amoeboid microglial cells in the postnatal rat brain expressed 2′,3′-cyclic
nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) both in vivo and in vitro; however, the functional role of CNPase in
microglia has remained uncertain. This study extended the investigation to determine CNPase expression in
activated microglia derived from cell culture and animal models of brain injury with the objective to clarify its
putative functions.
Methods: Three-day-old Wistar rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to induce
microglial activation, and the rats were killed at different time points. Along with this, primary cultured microglial
cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and expression of CNPase was analyzed by real-time reverse
transcription PCR and immunofluorescence. Additionally, siRNA transfection was employed to downregulate CNPase in
BV-2 cells. Following this, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-1β and TNF-α were determined at mRNA and protein levels.
Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were also assessed by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay, respectively. In
parallel to this, CNPase expression in activated microglia was also investigated in adult rats subjected to fluid percussion
injury as well as middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Results: In vivo, CNPase immunofluorescence in activated microglia was markedly enhanced after lipopolysaccharide
treatment. A similar feature was observed in the rat brain after fluid percussion injury and middle cerebral artery
occlusion. In vitro, CNPase protein and mRNA expression was increased in primary microglia with lipopolysaccharide
stimulation. Remarkably, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-1β,TNF- α, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were
significantly upregulated in activated BV-2 cells with CNPase knockdown. siRNA knockdown of CNPase increased
microglia migration; on the other hand, microglial cells appeared to be arrested at G1 phase.
Conclusions: The present results have provided the first morphological and molecular evidence that CNPase
expression is increased in activated microglia. CNPase knockdown resulted in increased expression of various
inflammatory mediators. It is concluded that CNPase may play an important role as a putative anti-inflammatory
gene both in normal and injured brain.

Background
2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) is
a protein that hydrolyzes cyclic nucleotides to monophosphates
(2′ nucleotides). CNPase has two isoforms,
CNPase1 (46 kDa) and CNPase2 (48 kDa) [1], which are
encoded separately by different promoters of the same
gene [2,3] and have different structural properties and
subcellular localizations [4,5]. The majority of studies
involving CNPase expression have focused on its roles
in myelin-producing glial cells (oligodendrocytes and
Schwann cells) and myelinogenesis. However, growing
evidence has revealed the existence of this enzyme in
non-myelinating cells, such as adrenal cells [6] and neuroblastoma
cells (B104) [1]. Indeed, a considerable level of
CNPase expression and CNPase-like enzyme activity were
found in membranes of cells in the spleen, liver, kidney,
heart, and skeletal muscles [7,8]. We have reported
previously that CNPase expression was detected in
bone marrow stromal cells and amoeboid microglial
cells in the developing rat brain [9,10]. Interestingly,
CNPase expression and its enzyme activity was localized in
mitochondria, specifically in the mitochondrial membranes
[6,11-13]. In the mitochondria isolated from CNPase
knockdown OLN93 oligodendrocytes, a decrease in the
CNPase level and its activity correlated with the acceleration
of calcium release from the mitochondria [14].
These results demonstrate that CNPase may be implicated
in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes and may
regulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. It
is well documented that cellular Ca2+ signals are crucial in
the control of most physiological processes. Mitochondria
are considered as the main source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which could cause cell injury, and they are the
main site of the initiation of programmed cell death [15].
Previous localization of CNPase in amoeboid microglia
had prompted us to further investigate the role of this
enzyme in microglia, especially on activation. Microglial
cells have been demonstrated to be activated by a variety
of factors or stimuli and implicated in brain diseases and
pathological processes, such as infections, trauma and
inflammation [16,17]. Furthermore, microglial activation
and its sequelae has been shown to be involved in neurodegenerative
diseases and autoimmune diseases such
as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple
sclerosis [17-19]. Microglia, when chronically activated,
have been reported to cause neuronal damage through
the release of potentially cytotoxic molecules such as
proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and ROS
[20,21]. These mediators are thought to play contributory
roles to inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases
[22]. Because CNPase expression coexists with the
inflammatory mediators in microglia, which are enhanced
on activation, it was surmised that they might regulate
each other to perform the primary functions of microglia.
In light of the above, this study sought to determine if
CNPase is expressed in activated microglia both in vivo
and in vitro, and to elucidate how it might be regulated
during microglial activation. To this end, upregulation of
CNPase in microglia was elicited with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) treatment and downregulation of CNPase by its
specific siRNA; this might help to unravel the specific
roles of CNPase in microglia in normal and pathological
conditions.
Methods
Animals
Wistar rats (3 days of age) were purchased from the Laboratory
Animal Centre, National University of Singapore.
All experiments were carried out in accordance with the
International Guiding Principles for Animal Research,
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, National University of Singapore (protocol
number NUS/ IACUC/2013-05512), and DSO Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number DSO/
IACUC/10/94). All efforts were made to minimize pain and
the number of rats used.
Injection of lipopolysaccharide
To investigate CNPase expression in activated microglia
in vivo, 3-day-old postnatal rats were weighed and given
a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (1 mg/kg of
body weight, diluted in 250 μl saline; Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. L2654). In the control group
(n = 3), LPS injections were replaced by an injection of
saline (250 μl each pup). The pups were sacrificed at 1,
3, and 6 hours after LPS injection (n = 3 rats at each
time point interval for each group). Frozen sections were
prepared for immunohistochemistry.
Fluid percussion injury
The lateral fluid percussion model of traumatic brain injury
is one of the most extensively utilized animal models
of traumatic brain injury due to its validity, reliability, clinical
relevance and its usefulness in identifying cellular and
molecular changes. The device consists of a Plexiglas cylindrical
reservoir filled with distilled water or saline (Custom
Design and Fabrication, Richmond, VA, USA). Sprague
Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 280 g (n = 6 per
group) were anesthetized with inhalational anesthesia (3 to
5% of isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 1 l/minute)
prior to the surgical procedure. The scalp was shaved and
swabbed alternately with a chlorhexidane-alcohol swab.
Thermoregulation was maintained by placing a warming
pad (CMA 150, CMA Microdialysis, Kista, Sweden; or
Right Temp Homeothermic warming system, Kent
Scientific, Torrington, CT, USA) at 37 ± 0.5°C under the
animal. With the aid of a stereotaxic atlas, a 4 mm hole
was made at −3.8 mm bregma and left lateral 2.0 mm. A

modified female Luer-Lok was twisted rigidly over the
hole until the cannula abutted the dural surface. The pendulum
was placed at a height that would inflict severe
injury (~50 to 70 psi) by defining the force of the fluid
pressure pulse transmitted through the saline reservoir.
The burr hole was filled with collagen (Lyostypt®, B Braun
Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and the incision
sutured closed after the injury. Sham-operated animals
received anesthesia and surgery, including probe removal
and reinsertion but were not subjected to trauma treatment.
The animals were sacrificed at 7 days post-injury
and the brains were paraffin-fixed and prepared for
immunohistochemistry.
Stroke rat brain model
Sprague–Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 280 g
were used. The rats were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal
injection of pentobarbital sodium (Ceva Sante
Animale, Libourne, France; 50 mg/kg), and were fixed in
the left lateral position. Following anesthesia, the rats were
subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
The surgical procedure followed that described previously
by Wu and Ling [23]. Briefly, following incision of the
skin, the right temporal muscle was excised and cleared
until the underlying zygomatic arch was exposed. A circular
hole, 3 mm in diameter, was burred in the right parietal
bone with a dental drill and cold saline drip. The circular
opening was enlarged with a rongeur by removing additional
bone at the periphery to expose the main trunk of
the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The pieces of bone
removed were kept in cold saline. Care was taken not to
damage the underlying cerebral cortex during craniotomy.
The MCA was cauterized using a small vessel cauterizer
(Fine Science Tools, North Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada), after which the bone flaps were replaced and the
muscle and skin sutured separately, layer to layer. The rectal
temperature was monitored and maintained between
37.5 and 38.5°C during the operation. On recovering from
anesthesia, the rats showed signs of paresis of both the left
limbs, especially the hind limb. In sham-operated rats, the
same surgical procedure was carried out but the MCA was
not cauterized. Along with MCAO and sham operated rats,
normal rats (n = 9) of equivalent body weight were also
used as controls. Brain tissues from rats subjected to
MCAO (n = 9) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
These tissues were paraffin-embedded and coronal sections
at 7 μm thickness were cut on a microtome and collected
on gelatin-coated slides for immunofluorescence staining.
Double immunofluorescence staining in vivo
Normal postnatal control rats (n = 3) and LPS injected
rats (n = 3, each at 1, 3 and 6 hours post-LPS injection)
were used for immunofluorescence studies to detect the
expression of CNPase in microglial cells. The rats were
anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine cocktail (75 mg/kg
and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and perfused with Ringer’s
solution followed by 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Following perfusion, the brains
were removed, post-fixed for 4 hours in the same fixative
and then cryoprotected in 15% sucrose at 4°C overnight.
Frozen sections (30 μm thick) were cut coronally through
the forebrain with a cryostat (Model CM 3050; Leica
Instruments GmbH, Nubloch, Germany) and mounted
onto gelatin-coated slides and stored at – 20°C until use.
The brain sections at different timepoints were rinsed
with PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum diluted in
PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Following removal
of serum, tissue sections were incubated with mouse antihuman
CNPase monoclonal primary antibody (dilution
1:100; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA; Cat. No. MAB
326) overnight at room temperature. On the next day, the
sections were washed in PBS and incubated with a mixture
of secondary antibodies: FITC-conjugated lectin from
tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich;
Cat. No. L-0401) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:200, Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. No. T5393) for 1 hour at room
temperature. The sections were then washed in PBS and
mounted using a fluorescent mounting medium (Dako,
Oregon City, USA; Cat. No. S3023). Cellular localization
was then examined under a confocal microscope (Fluoview
1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with the same exposure settings
for each comparison group. Tissue sections derived
from MCAO and fluid perfusion injury (FPI) were processed
with the immunofluorescence staining methods as
described above.
Primary culture and lipopolysaccharide treatment of
microglial cells
Three-day-old postnatal rats were also used for the preparation
of primary culture of microglia (n = 36). Increased
CNPase expression was observed in activated microglia in
preliminary immunofluorescence labeling. In view of this,
primary culture of microglia was prepared for in vitro
investigations. Glial cells were isolated from the brains of
rat pups and were placed in a 75 cm2 flask at a density
of ~1.2 × 106 cells/ml of DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% antibiotic
antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. No. A5955).
The flasks were then placed in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO
2
and 95% air at 37°C. The culture
medium was changed every 48 to 72 hours. Microglia
were isolated from the mixed glial population by a method
described previously [24] when mixed glial cells were confluent
(12to14days).Thepurityofmicrogliawasassessed
by immunofluorescence labeling using FITC-conjugated
lectin (a marker of microglia) from tomato (Lycopersicon

Microglial cultures with more than 96% purity were
used for the study. For immunostaining, ~2.5 × 105 cells/
well were plated on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips placed
in 24-well plates. For LPS treatment, primary cultured
microglial cells were stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml LPS in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 hours.
BV-2 cell culture
Murine BV-2 microglial cell lines were maintained in
75 cm2 culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 2%
FBS and 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
2
and 95% air. Cells
were plated on 24-well plates at a density of ~6.0 × 104
per well for immunocytochemistry and at ~3 × 105 per
well on a 6-well plate for gene silencing CNPase transfection
studies, RNA isolation, protein extraction and
flow cytometric assay. On the following day after plating,
cells were subjected to different treatments. The time
point (6 hours) and dosage (1.0 μg/ml) of LPS (Sigma-
Aldrich; Cat. NO. L2654) treatment were chosen based
on results obtained from carrying out the MTS assay
from previous reports [25].
Immunofluorescence staining of microglial cells in vitro
Primary microglial cells and BV-2 cells were plated on
poly-L-lysine coated cover slips in a 24-well plate. For
immunofluorescence labeling, the cells subjected to different
treatments of varying durations were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature
and blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 hour. The
cells were then separately incubated overnight at 4°C with
mouse anti-human CNPase monoclonal antibody (1:100;
Chemicon; Cat. No. MAB326), rabbit anti-mouse TNF-α
polyclonal antibody (1:100, Millipore Bioscience Research
Reagents, Billerica, MA, USA; Cat. No. AB2148P),
rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β polyclonal antibody (1:100,
Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents; Cat. No. AB1413),
and mouse anti-mouse inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) monoclonal antibody (1:100, BD Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA USA; Cat. No.640432), followed by Cy3-
conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich;
Cat. No. C2181) or Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich; Cat.
No. C2306) incubation for 1 hour at room temperature.
The cells were then washed three times with PBS and
mounted using a fluorescent mounting medium (Sigma-
Aldrich; Cat. No. F6057). Cellular localization was then
examined under a confocal microscope (Fluoview 1000;
Olympus) with the same exposure settings for each comparison
group.
Silencing of CNPase with siRNA
Two constructs of mouse CNPase-specific siRNA (Ambion,
Foster City, CA, USA; siRNA ID: s64160 & s64161; Cat.
No. 4390771) were used for CNPase silencing. Nonspecific
scramble siRNA (Ambion; Cat. No. 4390846) was used as
control siRNA. To achieve a higher siRNA knockdown
efficiency, the reverse transfection method was adopted
for silencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, sub-confluent, early passage BV-2 cells were harvested
by trypsinization, centrifuged and resuspended in
Optimem (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat.
No. 31985070) and plated in 6-well plates at a density
of ~3 × 105 cells/well. This was followed by adding 500 μl
Optimem with 5 μl siRNA (10 μM) and 4 μl Lipofectamine
® RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen; Cat.
No. 13778075) dropwise in the above well. The cells were
incubated with the siRNA transfection mixture for 8 hours
and then the medium was replaced with DMEM with
10% FBS without antibiotics and incubated for another
16 hours for RNA extraction to detect the knockdown
efficiency by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Microglial
cells were subjected to LPS treatment for 6 hours at
42 hours after transfection. After that, cells were either
fixed for immunofluorescence staining, or mRNA and
protein extracted for real-time RT-PCR and western
blotting, respectively.
Cell viability analysis of BV-2 cells
The effect of siRNA transfection on the viability of BV-
2 cells was evaluated by CellTiter 96® AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg
, WI, USA; Cat. No. G3580). The cell viability of
non-transfected BV-2 cells, control siRNA transfected
BV-2 cells, and CNPase siRNA transfected BV-2 cells
were measured. The dye solution was added to the
cells at 24 hours post-transfection and incubated for
up to 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO
2
incubator.
The absorbance was read at 490 nm using the Tecan 2000
microplate reader. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage
of non-transfected BV-2 cells.
Cell cycle analysis
For each experiment, control siRNA and CNPase siRNA
transfected cells were harvested at 48 hours posttransfection
and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell
pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS and fixed in
4.5 ml 70% cold ethanol overnight at 4°C. Ethanol-fixed
cells were washed twice with PBS before resuspending
with 200 μg/ml propidium iodide solution containing
1 mg/ml RNAse A, PBS and Triton-X. Cells were incubated
at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the
DNA content of cells to be stained before analysis by flow
cytometry.
Real-time reverse-transcription PCR
The total RNA was extracted from primary microglial
cells and BV-2 microglial cells subjected to various

treatments (LPS, control and CNPase siRNA transfection)
using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The concentration of RNA was quantified with Nanodrop
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific; Model No.
ND1000). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using the SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen; Cat. No 18080–051) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting cDNA was diluted
and used as a template for real-time reverse transcription
PCR using an ABi 7900HT Fast PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer pairs for 
CNPase, TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and β-actin were designed
using the primer design program (Primer 3 software version
1.0, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research,
Cambridge, MA, USA). The primer sequences for the
genes are listed in Table 1. The RT-PCR was carried
out in a 10 μl final volume containing the following:
5 μl 2 × SYBR Green fast master mix (Invitrogen); 1 μl
5 μM forward primer and 1 μl 5 μM reverse primer;
and 3 μl diluted cDNA. After an initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 15 minutes, temperature cycling was
initiated. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94°C
for 15 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 25 seconds, and
elongation at 72°C for 20 seconds. In total, 45 cycles
were performed. Mouse β-actin was amplified as the
control for normalizing the quantities of transcripts of
each of the genes mentioned above. The differences in
expression for CNPase, TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS between
the control and treated cells were calculated by normalizing
with the β-actin gene expression according to the
following formula [26]:
Western blotting analysis
Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed using
M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo
Fish Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA; Cat. No. 78501)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fish Scientific
Inc.; Cat. NO. 78410) and nuclear protein extraction
kit (Millipore; Cat. No. 2900). The lysate was collected by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. The
amount of protein was quantified using a protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat. No. 500–0002) and
20 μg of protein sample was loaded to 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis.
Separated proteins were then transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry
electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour at room
temperature, then they were incubated with mouse antihuman
CNPase monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Chemicon),
rabbit anti-mouse TNF-α polyclonal antibody (1:1000,
Millipore), rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β polyclonal antibody
(1:1000, Millipore), mouse anti-mouse iNOS monoclonal
antibody (1:500, BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-human
NF-κB monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling,
Beverley,MA,USA;Cat.No.4764), mouse anti-human
β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich;
Cat. No. A5441) and rabbit anti-mouse Lamin A polyclonal
antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA; Cat.
No. sc-20680) overnight on a shaker at 4°C. After three
washes with TBS-0.1% Tween, the membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour. The proteins were detected with a
chemiluminescence detection system according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Supersignal West Pico Horseradish
Peroxidase Detection Kit; Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL, USA; Cat. No. 34077) and developed on the
film. The band intensity was quantified in Image J software
(National Institutes of Health, USA). Each lane of
protein band density was normalized withβ-actin.
Measurement of reactive oxygen species production in
BV-2 microglia by flow cytometry
Briefly, BV-2 cells were grown in a 6-well plate at a
density of ~3.0 × 105 per well and treated as described
above. After that, cells were washed twice with PBS.
Staining was performed for 40 minutes at 37°C in the
dark with 10 μmol/L CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probers,
Grand Island, NY, USA; Cat. No. C6827). Cells were
washed twice with PBS and harvested by trypsinization,
centrifuged and resuspended in PBS, then immediately
measured with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). The data obtained were analyzed with
FlowJo software, Flowjo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).

Nitric oxide concentration measurement
Cell culture medium was collected from control siRNA
or CNPase siRNA transfected BV-2 cells with and
without LPS treatment. The NO concentration in the
culture medium was quantified by a Griess reagent system
NO colorimetric BioAssay™ Kit (US Biological,
Swampscott, MA, USA, Cat. No N2577-01) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. The absorbance at 540 nm
was determined with a microplate reader (GENIOS, Tecan,
Switzerland).
Statistical analyses
The GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, USA) was
used for statistical analysis. The data were expressed as
mean ± SD. Unpaired t-test and one-way analysis of variance
were performed for comparison of two and more
than two groups in the in vitro experiments, respectively.
*P<0.05,  **P< 0.01 and ***P< 0.001 were considered as
statistically significant.
Results
CNPase expression is increased in microglia after
lipopolysaccharide treatment in postnatal rats
To investigate the function of CNPase in microglial
cells in the developing brain with LPS stimulation, we
profiled the expression of CNPase in activated microglia
in the brain, as well as primary cultured microglial
cells subjected to LPS treatment. In vivo, CNPase expression
was colocalized in lectin-labeled amoeboidic
microglial cells in the brain (Figure 1). At 1, 3 and 6 hours
after LPS treatment, CNPase expression in sporadic
microglia was markedly increased (Figure 1). Consistent
with results in vivo, mRNA expression and immunoexpression
changes in CNPase were also upregulated in the
primary cultured microglia. CNPase immunofluorescence
intensity was enhanced (Figure 2B) and mRNA expression
(Figure 2C) was significantly increased more than threefold
versus control when primary microglial cells were
subjected to LPS treatment for 24 hours. It is noteworthy
that microglial cells exhibited many long extending
and stout processes after 24 hours of LPS treatment
(Figure 2A).
CNPase expression is increased in microglia after middle
cerebral artery occlusion and fluid perfusion injury in
adult rats
Since microglia is activated in response to brain injury,
we have analyzed CNPase expression in activated microglia
in the cerebrum from MCAO and FPI rat models.
Enhanced CNPase expression was localized in activated
microglial cells in the ischemic cortex of the cerebral
hemisphere (Figure 3A) as well as in the FPI injury cortex
(Figure 3B) when compared with the sham group.
Silencing of CNPase gene in BV-2 cells
To further determine roles of CNPase in microglial cells
after LPS treatment, siRNA was employed to knockdown
the CNPase gene in BV-2 cells. BV-2 cells were either
transfected with control siRNA or CNPase siRNA. The
external morphology of transfected BV-2 cells was comparable
to the non-transfected BV-2 cells under the
phase-contrast microscope (Figure 4A). Compared with
the non-transfected control BV-2 cells, the cell viability
was about 92% and 91% after control siRNA and
CNPase siRNA transfection, respectively (Figure 4B).
Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA obtained
from BV-2 microglia treated with two different
siRNA constructs (160# and 161#) against CNPase mRNA.
It was observed that construct 161# produced the maximum
CNPase knockdown efficiency, which was achieved
at about 94% at 24 hours post-transfection when compared
to control siRNA transfected cells (Figure 4C), and
hence was used for subsequent functional analysis. Moreover
, downregulation of the CNPase protein was verified
by western blot analysis at 48 hours post-transfection
which showed a reduction in the expression of CNPase
protein by 75% (Figure 4D). Confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy also showed an obvious reduction in
CNPase immunostaining intensity in CNPase knockdown
BV-2 cells (Figure 4E).
Knockdown of CNPase expression in BV-2 cells prompted
increased production of inflammatory mediators
mRNA expression of LPS-induced inflammatory mediators
including iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α was drastically elevated
in CNPase silencing BV-2 cells with LPS treatment.
The most remarkable increase was observed in iNOS
mRNA expression, which was increased nine-fold in control
siRNA transfected BV-2 cells with LPS treatment for
6 hours. The increase was even more dramatic, nearing
twenty-fold in CNPase silencing BV-2 cells with exposure
to LPS for the same duration (Figure 5A). A similar trend
was observed in IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA expression
levels across the different groups of cells subjected to
various treatments. In parallel with mRNA expression,
western blot results showed that protein expression
levels of iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-1 β were significantly increased
in LPS treated BV-2 cells with CNPase knockdown
compared with those transfected with control siRNA
(Figure 5B). As in mRNA expression level, iNOS protein
expression level was highest when compared with that
of TNF-α and IL-1β.Thiswasfurther verifiedbyconfocal
immunofluorescence microscopy, which showed
an obvious increased expression in iNOS, IL-1β and
TNF-α immunostaining intensity in LPS treated BV-2
cells with CNPase knockdown compared with the
LPS-stimulated control siRNA transfected BV-2 cells
(Figure 5C). Flow cytometry results revealed that

in control siRNA transfected BV-2 cells with LPS treatment
, and this increase was more significant in activated
BV-2 cells with CNPase knockdown when compared
with the former (Figure 6A). Moreover, similar changes
in NO concentration in the supernatant derived from
the different treatments mentioned above were observed
(Figure 6B).
Effects of CNPase knockdown on cell cycle progression
Cell-cycle progression of BV-2 cells with or without
CNPase knockdown was examined. As shown in Figure 7,
in activated BV-2 cells, silencing of the CNPase gene
increased the percentages of cells in G1 phases and
decreased the percentages of cells in the S and G2/M
phases (Figure 7). There was no significant change in the

CNPase siRNA transfected cells showed a significantly
higher percentage of cells in the G1 phase (53%) as compared
to control siRNA treated cells (39%). A decrease in
the number of cells in S phase was also observed for
CNPase siRNA transfected cells as compared to control

Effects of CNPase knockdown on NF-κB transcriptional
activity
NF-κB is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a pivotal
role in immune and inflammatory responses by regulating
genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion
molecules, chemokines, growth factors, and inducible
enzymes. NF-κB was significantly increased in BV-2 cells
with LPS treatment for 3 hours. However, this increase is
comparable to activated BV-2 cells with CNPase knockdown
(Figure 8).
Discussion
CNPase is named after its ability to catalyze the phosphodiester
hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides to 2′-nucleotides
[27]. However, the physiologically relevant substrates
and the specific biological roles of CNP in mammalian

cells had remained to be fully clarified. CNPase is present
in diverse eukaryotes and it is reported to be expressed at
low levels in many mammalian tissues, at higher levels in
dendritic cells, and at extremely high levels in oligodendrocytes
, the major glial cells in the human brain [28-30].
CNPase is expressed as two isoforms, with CNPase 2
identical to CNPase 1 with a 20 amino acid extension at
the N-terminus of CNPase 2 [31]. Mitochondrial CNPase
localization was also observed in glial (C6) and non-glial
cells (CHO, NIH 3 T3, HeLaS3) [12,32]. In our studies, it
was observed that mitochondrial CNPase protein was significantly
higher than that in cytosol in BV-2 microglial
cells (Additional file 1).
We previously reported CNPase expression in the
amoeboid microglial cells transiently occurring in the
perinatal brain [9]. It was further shown that CNPase
was markedly elevated in activated microglia. In view of
this, it was suggested that CNPase might be linked to
the major functions of the activated microglia such as
release of chemokines and cytokines, but the specific
functional roles of the enzyme in microglia remains uncertain.
Here, we extended the study and demonstrated
additional roles of microglial CNPase, such as its ability
to inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators,
besides its well-documented maintenance function in
oligodendrocytes.
CNPase was found to be induced in activated microglia,
not only in the developing brain and primary microglial
cultures (Figure 2), but also in activated microglia in
traumatic brain injury and experimentally induced cerebral
ischemia in adult rats (Figure 3). Whether the increased
CNPase expression was caused by the inflammationassociated
cytokines is still unknown. Notwithstanding,
since increased CNPase expression was detected in activated
microglia, a key player in neuroinflammation, it is
proposed that the enzyme might be linked to inflammatory
responses as discussed below.
Microglia play a pivotal role in the innate central nervous
system immune response by facilitating neuroprotection
and repair processes against invading pathogens [33].
During neuroinflammation, activated microglia lead to
clearance of debris or invading pathogens, and release of
neurotrophic factors that regulate the microenvironment
[34,35]. However, in response to injury, microglia transform
into a more motile state and migrate to the site of
damage [36,37]. These activated microglia produce a variety
of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as the small gas
molecule NO, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
TNF-α and IL-1β. These molecules have been reported to
play important roles in the initiation and progression of
severe neurodegenerative diseases [38,39]. We showed
here that CNPase is constitutively expressed in microglia
and that it is augmented after LPS treatment. Based on
this premise, we adopted siRNA transfection to knockdown
CNPase mRNA expression to further elucidate its
roles in activated microglia. Remarkably, siRNA CNPase
knockdown affected the expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. More specifically, lowering CNPase expression
significantly promoted mRNA and protein expression
of iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α induced by LPS treatment,
suggesting that CNPase may have a suppression effect
on iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α production in activated
microglial cells.
Along with iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α, NO and ROS
productions were increased after siRNA CNPase knockdown
with LPS treatment. The pro-inflammatory mediator
NO is the product of the inducible isoform of NOS
[40]. NO is a signaling molecule involved in a wide range
of physiological and pathological processes. Examples of
its involvement include neural transmission and immune
response. An excess production of NO can also lead to
the initiation and maintenance of inflammation [41,42]. In
this study, lowering CNPase expression significantly promoted
LPS-induced release of NO in BV-2 cells when
compared with the control siRNA group. This suggests
that CNPase may act to suppress production of NO and
hence modulate the neuronal and immune response to
administration of LPS.
The mechanism via which CNPase can regulate
neuroinflammation remains unclear. Overproduction of
(See figure on previous page.)

transfected BV-2 (normalized withβ-actin), but the increase was significantly higher in LPS stimulated CNPase siRNA transfected BV-2 cells compared

pro-inflammatory mediators by activated microglia may
be a risk factor for neurodegenerative onset via the activation
of cell-signaling pathways. The nuclear transcriptional
factor NF-κB is a key inflammatory regulator. The
translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus induces transcription
of pro-inflammatory genes by binding to specific promoter
regions [43,44]. It is speculated that there might
exist an interlink between NF-κB and CNPase. However,

stimulation in BV-2 cells. (A) Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and production of nitric oxide (NO) in BV-2 cells transfected with control

NF-κB expression remained relatively unchanged in
CNPase silencing cells treated with LPS. It is therefore
suggested that increased production of inflammatory
cytokines, NO and ROS in CNPase knockdown BV-2
cells due to LPS treatment may be achieved by NF-κB-
independent signaling pathways.
ROS are central players in the physiological control
of cellular functions as modulators of proinflammatory
processes in microglia-associated neurodegenerative
diseases [45,46]. Furthermore, a positive feedback loop
can be established between ROS and inflammatory cytokines
, and these cytokines and chemokines, in turn, stimulate
a cascade of events leading to increased oxidative
stress via iNOS activation [35]. Studies exploring the
mechanisms linking ROS and inflammation found that
ROS derived from mitochondria act as signal-transducing

molecules that provoke the upregulation of inflammatory
cytokine subsets via distinct molecular pathways [47,48].
The present results showed that the production of ROS
was significantly increased in activated BV-2 cells with
CNPase knockdown, and it has been demonstrated
that CNPase expression was mainly localized in the
mitochondria. Taken together, it is suggested that CNPase
might be involved in the above intricate process either
through direct or indirect regulatory mechanism, especially
the ROS signal pathway; however, this remains to be
further investigated. CNPase has been shown to take part
in the regulation of cytoskeleton [49,50], which plays important
roles in the cell motility process. In view of this, it
was speculated that CNPase might be implicated in the
regulation of microglia migration. In the present study,
knockdown of CNPase appeared to promote the migration
ability of microglia (Additional file 2) indicating that
CNPase may inhibit the migration of microglia that may
be due to the stabilization of cytoskeletal dynamics,
but this awaits further exploration. In addition to this,
it has been reported that G1 arrest could be due to ROS
generation [51]. Here, we found CNPase knockdown in
activated BV-2 cells led to the increased production of
ROS coupled by the G1 arrest. This suggests that CNPase
may prompt microglia proliferation, as evidenced by the
massive increase in activated microglia with highly
expressed CNPase in the infarcted zones in MCAO and in
the traumatic brain injury areas.
In summary, our results suggest that CNPase might be
neuroprotective against microglia-initiated neuroinflammation.
Investigation of the possible mechanisms of CNPase
in anti-inflammatory roles awaits further investigation.
Because CNPase is known to regulate multiple cellular
functions, it is important to further explore whether
inflammation-related CNPase expression might contribute
to disease progression of chronic inflammation in the central
nervous system. In this regard, CNPase, which has
been shown to take part in the above functions of activated
microglial cells, should therefore be considered as a
potential therapeutic target among others.
Conclusions
The present results have provided the first morphological
and molecular evidence that CNPase expression

an important role as a putative anti-inflammatory gene
both in normal and injured brain.
