Abstract αB-crystallin (αBC) is involved in diverse cellular
activities. Previous studies demonstrated that αBC had
anti-apoptotic and proliferation-promoting effects in multiple
diseases. Here, we explored the αBC’s roles in the 
pathophysiology of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An
ICH rat model was established and assessed by behavioral
tests. Using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, significant
up-regulation of αBC was found in neurons and
astrocytes in brain areas surrounding the hematoma following
ICH. Increase of αBC expression was found to be
accompanied by the increased expression of proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p53, Bax, and activecaspase-3. αBC was co-localized with PCNA in astrocytes
or active-caspase-3 in neurons, suggesting its role in astrocyte
proliferation and neuronal apoptosis. Our in vitro study,
using αBC RNA interference in PC12 cells, indicated that
αBC might exert its anti-apoptotic function in neuronal
apoptosis. Thus, αBC may play a role in protecting the
brain from secondary damage following ICH.

Introduction
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second leading stroke
with poor prognosis (Ikram et al. 2012) that causes permanent
disability or death due to primary and secondary damages.
Subsequent edema, cellular injury, and the activation
of cytotoxic, excitotoxic, oxidative, and inflammatory cascades
altogether contribute to the secondary injury, while
the primary damage is caused by the mass effect of hematoma
formation (Aronowski and Zhao 2011). Pathologic
changes of ICH include neuronal apoptosis, astrocyte proliferation
, and oligodendrocyte death (Bradl and Lassmann
2010; Gong et al. 2001; Sukumari-Ramesh et al. 2012).
Neuronal apoptosis is the most crucial event composed of
perplexing pro-apoptotic activations and subtle antiapoptotic
accommodation. Caspase-3, a key factor in the
execution phase of cell apoptosis, is frequently activated
during apoptosis via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
(Elmore 2007). Caspase-3 activation by pro-apoptotic Bcl-
2-family protein Bax has been found to be a key determinant
in tumor suppressor p53-induced apoptosis in neurons
(Cregan et al. 1999). Astrocyte proliferation, occurring after
injury to CNS, is usually presented by changes in morphology
, immunophenotype, and proliferative activities (Dihne
et al. 2001).
αB-crystallin (αBC), a member of the widely spread and
poorly conserved small heat shock proteins (sHSPs)
(Acunzo et al. 2012a), was reported to be associated with
apoptosis regulators such as p53, Bax, and caspase-3 (Hu et
al. 2012; Hu and Li 2008; Launay et al. 2010; Liu et al.
2007). αBC is well known for its role in maintaining the
transparency of the ocular lens (Horwitz 2000). It is also
expressed in non-lens tissues such as the brain and accumulates
under pathological conditions (Iwaki et al.1989).αBC
responds to stress stimuli and translocates to the

cytoskeleton which is helpful in stabilizing cells (Djabali et
al. 1997; Parcellier et al. 2005). Furthermore,αBC has been
found to be associated with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular
diseases, as well as cancers such as breast cancer
(Launay et al. 2010; Moyano et al. 2006; Wilhelmus et al.
2006). The participation of αBC in various cellular activities
such as apoptosis and proliferation has drawn increasing
attention (Adhikari et al. 2011; Renkawek et al. 1992).
We hereby propose that αBC may play a role in the
secondary injury following ICH. To test this hypothesis,
we have examined the expression and distribution of αBC
surrounding the hematoma in an ICH rat model. We aim to
pave the way for further studies to evaluate the clinical
potentials ofαBC.
Materials and Methods
Animals and the ICH Model
All animal surgical interventions were carried out according
to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the
Chinese National Committee to Use of Experimental
Animals for Medical Purposes, Jiangsu Branch. Male
Sprague–Dawley rats with an average weight of 250 g were
used. The rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with chloral
hydrate (10 % solution). After that, the rats were positioned
in a stereotaxic frame, and a cranial burr hole (1 mm
in diameter) was drilled (Yang et al. 2008). Autologous
whole blood (50 μL) was collected in a sterile syringe by
cutting the tail tip (Xue and Del Bigio 2003). The syringe
was inserted stereotaxically into the right caudate putamen
(coordinates: 0.2 mm anterior, 5.5 mm ventral, and 3.5 mm
lateral to the bregma), and the autologous blood injected at
the rate of 10 μL/min. Following injection, the needle was
kept in place for over 10 min before being removed.
Animals were then allowed to return to home cages and
housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were
available ad libitum. Animals in the experimental group
were killed for protein extraction for Western blot at 6 and
12 h, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days (n=3 per time point) after
ICH. Rats in the sham group (n=3) were killed on the third
day. Additional two rats at each time point from the experimental
group were killed for pathologic studies. All efforts
were made to minimize the total number of animals used
and their suffering.
Cell Cultures and Stimulation
PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 % donor
horse serum, and antibiotics at 37 °C under 5 % CO
2
in
humidified air. The cells were passed every 3–4 days. To
study apoptosis, cells were seeded onto a poly-L-lysinecoated
60-mm dishes and incubated in a low concentration
of serum (1 % horse serum) for 24 h prior to treatment with
hemin in 100μmol/L at different time points.
Behavioral Testing Procedures
Forelimb Placing Test
Rats were held by the torsos, allowing the forelimb to hang
free. Each forelimb was elicited by brushing the respective
vibrissae on the corner edge of a countertop. Intact rats placed
the forelimb quickly onto the countertop. Depending on the
severity of the injury in ICH rats, placing of the forelimb
contralateral to the injury was impaired. Each rat was tested
ten times for each forelimb, and the percentage of trials in
which the rat placed the left forelimb was calculated
(Karabiyikoglu et al. 2004).
Corner Turn Test
Rats were allowed to proceed into a corner, with the angle of
30°. To exit the corner, the rat should turn either to the left or
to the right, and only the turns involving full rearing along
either wall were included (a total of eight per animal).
Injured rats would show a tendency to turn to the side of
the injury. The percentage of right turns was used as the
corner turn score (Hua et al. 2002).
Western Blot Analysis
Tissues surrounding the hematoma (2 mm from the incision)
and the counterparts from either the contralateral side of the
brain or the sham rats were dissected and flash-frozen
at −80 °C. To prepare the lysates, frozen samples were
weighed and minced on ice. The samples were homogenized
in lysis buffer (1 % NP-40, 50 mmol/L Tris, pH=7.5,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 %
sodium deoxycholate, 1 % Triton-X100, 1 mmol/L PMSF,
10 μg/mL aprotinin, and 1 μg/mL leupeptin) and centrifuged
at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min to collect the
supernatant. After the determination of concentration with
the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the samples were subjected to
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a
polyvinylidene diflouride filter membrane by a transfer apparatus
at 350 mA for 2 h. The membrane was blocked with
5 % non-fat milk for 2 h and incubated with primary antibody
against αBC (1:1,000; Santa Cruz), glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1,000; Sigma), PCNA (1:1,000;
Santa Cruz), p53 (1:500; Santa Cruz), Bax (1:500; Santa
Cruz), or caspase-3 (1:500; Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight.
The membranes were then incubated with a second antibody

for 2 h and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
system (Pierce Company, USA).
Sections and Immunohistochemistry
Rats were anesthetized and underwent transcardial perfusion
with 500 mL of 0.9 % saline followed by 4 % 
paraformaldehyde at defined survival times. After perfusion
, the brains were removed and post-fixed in the
same fixative for 3 h and transferred to 20 % sucrose
for 2–3 days, followed by immersion in 30 % sucrose
for another 2–3 days. Tissues were then cut at 7 μm
with a cryostat. All sections were stored at −20 °C
before use. For αBC single immunostaining, sections
were pre-incubated in a solution consisting of 10 %
donkey serum, 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA),
0.3 % Triton X-100, and 0.15 % Tween-20 for 2 h at
room temperature and incubated with anti-αBC antibody
(mouse, 1:100, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C.
Following incubation in the secondary antibody at
37 °C, the sections were color-reacted with 0.02 %
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.5 % H
2

.
The sections were finally air-dried, dehydrated, and
coverslipped. αBC staining was evaluated under a
Leica light microscope (Germany). Cells with strong or
moderate brown staining were rated as positive; cells
with no staining were rated as negative, while cells with
weak staining were scored separately (Huan et al.
2012).
Immunofluorescent Staining
Additional sets of sections were used for multiple fluorescence
staining. Sections were first blocked with solution
containing 10 % normal serum (same species as the secondary
antibody), 3 % (w/v) BSA, 0.1 % Triton X-100, and
0.05 % Tween-20 for 2 h at room temperature. The sections
were then incubated with primary antibodies against αBC
(goat or mouse, 1:100; Santa Cruz), GFAP (rabbit, 1:200;
Sigma), neuronal nuclei (NeuN, mouse, 1:600; Chemicon),
PCNA (rabbit, 1:100; Santa Cruz), and caspase-3 (rabbit,
1:100; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a mixture
of FITC- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at 4 °C. The stained
sections were examined with Leica confocal microscope or
Leica fluorescence microscope (Germany).

Results
Functional Damage Assessed by Behavioral Tests
at Diverse Time Points After ICH
Rats in the sham and ICH groups were tested with forelimb
placing and corner turn test at different time points. The ICH
group showed significant deficits in both tests comparing with
the sham group over the first 3 days (P<0.05). By 5 days and
thereafter, however, these deficits disappeared. Forelimb placing
and corner turn score returned to baseline (Fig. 1a, b).
Expression Profiles ofαBC Following ICH by Western Blot
Analysis
Western blot was performed to investigate the temporal patterns
ofαBC expression surrounding the hematoma at various
time points. αBC expression was low in the sham group but
progressively increased from 6 h after ICH, peaked at day 3
(P<0.05), and gradually returned to baseline levels (Fig.2a, b).
Expression and Distribution ofαBC Immunoreactivity
Consistent with the results from Western blot, the sham
group showed low level ofαBC staining (Fig.3a, b), similar
to the profiles in the contralateral side of the experimental
brains (Fig. 3c, d). In contrast, αBC-positive cells were
substantially increased in regions surrounding the hematoma
3 days after ICH (Fig. 3e, f, h). No staining was observed
in the negative control (Fig. 3g).
Phenotype ofαBC-Positive Cells
To further identify which cell types may be associated with the
peak expression of αBC after ICH (Fig. 4b, f, j), double
immunofluorescence was used to co-localizeαBC with different
markers, including NeuN (Fig.4a), GFAP (Fig.4e), or RIP
(Fig. 4i). In the sham brain, the expression of αBC was
restricted to RIP-positive cells, indicative of oligodendrocytes
(Fig. 4d, h, l). Interestingly, enhanced αBC expression was
observed in NeuN- or GFAP-positive cells, indicative of neurons
or astrocytes in areas surrounding the hematoma (Fig.4c,
g). However, no significant changes ofαBC immunoreactivity
were observed in oligodendrocytes, comparing the ICH group
with the sham group (Fig.4k), which contrasted to the findings
in astrocytes and neurons, whereαBC expression was significantly
increased (Fig. 4o). αBC was not expressed in the
negative control (Fig. 4m, o).
Detection of Cellular Proliferation in the Caudate Putamen
Surrounding the Hematoma After ICH
As shown above, the immunoreactivity of αBC was increased
in astrocytes. Western blot was performed to examine
the expression of GFAP and PCNA, a general marker for
dividing cells. GFAP and PCNA levels were both peaked at
day 5 after ICH (Fig. 5a–d). PCNA/GFAP or αBC/PCNA
co-localization by immunofluorescence was constantly observed
surrounding the hematoma. The majority of activated
astrocytes was PCNA-positive, and most of them expressed
αBC in the region (Fig. 5e–j).
Apoptosis After ICH
Western blot was performed to examine the expression of p53,
Bax, and active-caspase-3 (Fig.6a–d). The levels of these three
proteins significantly increased after ICH, with p53 peaking at
day 2, and Bax and active-caspase-3 expression both peaking at
day 3. Temporally, the increase of expression of p53, Bax, and
active-caspase-3 was correlated withαBC expression.αBC colocalized
well with active-caspase-3 in the vicinity of the hematoma
(Fig. 6e–j). The results indicated thatαBC might play an
important part in neuronal apoptosis via caspase-3-dependent
pathway after ICH, which might be regulated by p53.
αBC Regulates the Expression of Active-Caspase-3
and Neuronal Apoptosis In Vitro
To examine the roles of αBC in neuronal apoptosis, siRNA
was employed to knock down αBC in PC12 cells. Cells
transfected withαBC–siRNA, non-specific siRNA, or vehicle
were tested 48 h after transfection. siRNA significantly
knocked down the protein expression of αBC (Fig. 7a, b).
Levels of p53, Bax, and active-caspase-3 were significantly
increased 12 h afterαBC silencing in the presence or absence
of hemin stimulation (Fig. 7c, d). As demonstrated by DAPI
staining, silencing αBC promoted nuclear condensation and
peri-nuclear apoptotic bodies after hemin treatment (Fig. 7e).
Discussion
Equivalent to the amount of bleeding and the predilection site
in clinical scenarios, the present study built an ICH rat model
to imitate clinical ICH (Xue and Del Bigio 2003;Yangetal.
2008). The rats in our ICH model showed significant deficits
in behavioral performance. αBC was significantly increased
Fig. 7 Regulation of αBC on neuronal apoptosis. Western blot
showed siRNA-silencedαBC in PC12 cells (a). KnockingαBC down
induced increasing levels of p53, Bax, and active-caspase-3 in hemintreated
PC12 cells (c). The bar chartindicates the density ofαBC/p53/
Bax/active-caspase-3 versus GAPDH (b, d). Data are presented as
means ± SEM (asterisk means P<0.05, pound sign denotes P<0.05).
Immunofluorescence showed the co-localization of αBC/active-caspase-3
in control and non-specific siRNA or αBC siRNA-transfected
PC12 cells after hemin stimulus; meanwhile, the phenotype changes of
nuclei were also investigated via DAPI staining

by day 3 surrounding the hematoma, when there was a concomitant
upregulation of PCNA and GFAP. Importantly, p53,
Bax, and active-caspase-3 were also parallelly increased. High
level of αBC was found in neurons and astrocytes in the
vicinity of the hematoma and appeared to co-localize with
PCNA in astrocytes or active-caspase-3 in neurons. That
knocking αBC down by siRNA caused apoptosis in PC12
cells suggests thatαBC may play an important protective role
in neuronal apoptosis after ICH.
In addition to primary injury, ICH gives rise to a series of
molecular and cellular events (Matsushita et al. 2000; Wang
and Dore2007; Xi et al.2004). Neuronal apoptosis is one of
the most severe consequences. The secondary injury following
ICH comprises both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic
signaling cascades. Pro-apoptotic agents include p53, Bax,
and caspase-3 that are increased in our ICH model.
However, the increase in αBC suggests that αBC may
represent one of the anti-apoptotic aspects in ICH. It is
widely accepted that p53, as the tumor suppressor and
nuclear transcription factor, plays a vital role in the apoptosis.
p53 can trigger apoptosis not only through promoting
the transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax, but
more directly by acting at the level of mitochondria
(Culmsee and Mattson 2005; Wu et al. 2012). The expression
of p53 was upregulated in response to impairment,
which promotes the transcription of some specific target
genes like Bax (Martinou and Youle 2011). Bax, belonging
to the Bcl-2 family, is confirmed to regulate the release of
cytochrome C from the mitochondria and, along with other
proteins, forms channels to increase mitochondrial membrane
permeability. Further, the formation of an apoptosome
provides the chance to bring together the initiator molecules
of apoptotic pathway. As the key factor of execution phase
of apoptosis, caspase-3 converges signals from both the
intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (Porter and Janicke 1999).
The molecular mechanism that αBC regulates apoptosis
remains to be explored.αBC may regulate the transcription
of p53 when cells are under stress conditions (Mao et al.
2004). It is proposed that αBC could reduce the level of
intracellular p53. Also, a body of evidence has revealed the
effect ofαBC on the ultimate apoptotic executor caspase-3.
In cultured breast carcinoma cells,αBC negatively regulates
the activation of caspase-3 by inhibition of its autoproteolytic
maturation in both the mitochondrial and death receptor
pathways (Kamradt et al. 2001). Furthermore, αBC
could protect astrocytes from apoptosis induced by oxidative
stress via suppressing caspase-3 activation (Shin et al.
2009). Our results showing that knocking down αBC triggers
apoptosis in PC12 cells suggest that αBC my play its
anti-apoptotic role via the intrinsic pathway. Additionally,
αBC may also exert its anti-apoptotic function through the
extrinsic pathways. Pre-treatment ofαBC in vivo prevented
nitric oxide production and the increase of pro-inflammatory
cytokine TNF-α in acute neuroinflammation in mice
(Masilamoni et al. 2005), which is consistent with the result
thatαBC protected L929 cells against the cytotoxicity generated
by TNF-α (Mehlen et al. 1995).
Our results also suggest thatαBC may be associated with
astrocyte proliferation after ICH since αBC is highly
expressed in GFAP/PCNA-containing cells, which is in
agreement with sHSPs’ role in protecting cells from various
unfavorable conditions (Acunzo et al. 2012b). Astrocyte
activation is involved in various CNS diseases. When the
CNS undergoes an injury response, astrocytes usually proliferate
and increase in size and complexity of processes,
which leads to reactive gliosis or glial scarring. Reactive
astrocytes may not only produce neurotoxicity, inflammation
, or chronic pain (Fawcett and Asher 1999), but may
also protect cells or tissue from oxidative stress, facilitate
blood brain barrier repair, limit inflammation, and reduce
vasogenic edema after trauma or stroke. The effect ofαBC
on cell proliferation has been observed elsewhere. For example
,αBC promotes proliferation and diminishes apoptosis
in the breast (Gruvberger-Saal and Parsons 2006).
Accumulation of αBC is found to contribute to the proliferation
of glia in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (Renkawek et
al. 1992).
Taken together, our data suggest that αBC may play an
important role in preventing neuronal apoptosis and promoting
astrocyte proliferation following ICH. Further studies
are warranted to explore the therapeutic potentials of αBC
for ICH as well as ischemic stroke and other neurodegenerative
diseases.
