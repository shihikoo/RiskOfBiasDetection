Abstract: Atherosclerosis and its attendant clinical complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
peripheral artery disease, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western societies. In response 
to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, atherosclerotic lesion formation occurs from the participation of a 
range of cell types, inflammatory mediators, and shear stress. Over the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have 
emerged as evolutionarily conserved, noncoding small RNAs that serve as important regulators and fine-tuners
of a range of pathophysiological cellular effects and molecular signaling pathways involved in atherosclerosis. 
Accumulating studies reveal the importance of miRNAs in regulating key signaling and lipid homeostasis pathways 
that alter the balance of atherosclerotic plaque progression and regression. In this review, we highlight current 
paradigms of miRNA-mediated effects in atherosclerosis progression and regression. We provide an update on the 
potential use of miRNAs diagnostically for detecting increasing severity of coronary disease and clinical events. 
Finally, we provide a perspective on therapeutic opportunities and challenges for miRNA delivery in the field.

Atherosclerosis represents a chronic inflammatory disease 
of the arterial wall initiated by endothelial injury and subendothelial
lipoprotein retention, particularly at sites of disturbed
blood flow.1 The pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesion 
formation is a multistage process involving both immune and 
nonimmune cellular constituents of the vessel wall. Research 
over the past 3 decades has uncovered key signaling and molecular
regulatory pathways involved in the initiation and progression
of atherosclerotic plaques. The recent emergence of 
microRNAs (miRNAs) as important regulators of pathophysiological
processes, such as cellular adhesion, proliferation, lipid 
uptake and efflux, and generation of inflammatory mediators, 
has provided novel molecular insights into their impact on these 
pathways in atherosclerosis and identified new therapeutic targets.
In addition, the appreciation that miRNAs can be detected 
extracellularly including in circulating blood raises the potential
for their use as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, or in 
response to cardiovascular therapeutics. This review highlights 
the role of miRNAs implicated in regulating critical aspects of 
atherosclerotic lesion formation and regression. We also review 
the potential use of miRNAs diagnostically for detecting increasing
severity of coronary disease and clinical events.
Brief Primer on MiRNAs
MiRNAs were first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans in 
1993; however, their functional roles in human disease were 
not appreciated for nearly a decade later.2 MiRNAs are evolutionarily
conserved, small (average ≈18–24 nucleotides), 
single-stranded noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level by typically binding to the 
3′-untranslated region (UTR) of specific target mRNA sequences
(using a conserved ≈7–8 nucleotide seed sequence), thereby 
leading to reduced protein expression by blocking mRNA translation
and by promoting mRNA degradation.3–8 It is estimated 
that >60% of all protein-coding genes are directly regulated by 
miRNAs.9 Furthermore, a given miRNA may bind to and regulate
>1 target, sometimes as a part of the same signaling pathway.
Conversely, a given miRNA may harbor several distinct 
miRNA-binding sites within its 3′-UTR, adding multiple levels 
of regulation. As such, miRNAs are fine-tuners of gene expression
patterns in response to pathophysiological stimuli.
Intergenic miRNAs are located within the genome between 
gene-coding regions and are transcribed by their own promoters. 
By contrast, intronic miRNAs are found within intronic sequences
of protein-coding genes and often share the same upstream 
promoters and transcriptional regulation with their host genes. 
MiRNA biogenesis proceeds in response to a well-defined series
of cellular events.2,3,5 MiRNAs are transcribed primarily by 
RNA polymerase II (more rarely by polymerase III) to generate 
the primary miRNA transcript, termed pri-miRNAs that harbor a 
canonical hairpin structure including a 5′ cap and 3′ poly-A tail.4
The pri-miRNAs are converted to ≈70-nt-long hairpin precursor
miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Drosha/DGCR8 (Di George 
Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8) complex. Subsequently, the 
pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by 
Exportin 5, where it undergoes further processing by the RNase 
III enzyme complex Dicer (and other RNA-binding proteins) 
producing a mature miRNA duplex.10 This double-stranded 
product is composed of the mature miRNA guide strand and 
the miRNA passenger strand. The guide strand is typically incorporated
in the RNA-induced silencing complex that contains 
Argonaute2, which facilitates the miRNA binding to the target 
mRNA leading to mRNA degradation or translation inhibition.11
The mature miRNA sequences are named as either miRNA-
5p or miRNA-3p to represent the arm of the hairpin precursor 
from which they arose. Accumulating studies indicate that both 
miRNA-3p and miRNA-5p strands can be loaded into the RNA-
induced silencing complex to target mRNA expression. Finally, 
mature miRNAs (and pre-miRNAs) can be released from the cell 
and packaged into a range of microvesicles (ie, exosomes, apoptotic
bodies, and microparticles) that are detectable in peripheral 
circulation (sometimes in association with RNA-binding proteins 
such as Argonaute2) and may also be taken-up within tissues by 
cell-to-cell communication.
MiRNA Regulation of Lipoprotein Homeostasis
Cholesterol homeostasis is essential for cellular physiology, 
and altered levels of cellular or systemic cholesterol are associated
with metabolic diseases. In the circulation, cholesterol
is carried on lipoproteins, which can both deliver (eg, 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) and remove (eg, high-density 
lipoprotein [HDL]) cholesterol from cells and tissues to mediate
cholesterol homeostasis. Imbalances that favor the accumulation
of cellular cholesterol, such as high levels of 
LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and low levels of HDL-cholesterol 
(HDL-C), promote atherosclerosis. The recent discoveries of 
miRNAs that control LDL and HDL abundance and function 
have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulatory circuits
governing plasma lipoprotein levels.

Feinberg and Moore MicroRNA Regulation of Atherosclerosis 705
The liver plays a major role in both the production and the 
clearance of lipoproteins, and many hepatic-enriched miRNAs 
have been identified that functionally regulate lipoprotein metabolism.
miR-122 was the first miRNA implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism, and its expression is highly enriched in the 
liver.12 Loss-of-function experiments in both mice and nonhuman
primates identified miR-122 as a crucial regulator of 
cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, and thus lipoprotein homeostasis.12,13 Notably, miR-122 function seems to be broadly 
required for the expression of hepatocyte-specific genes, rather
than the specific targeting of lipid metabolism pathways.14
By contrast, miR-223 and miR-27b act as key post-transcriptional
regulatory hubs controlling networks of cholesterol and 
lipoprotein metabolism genes.15,16 miR-223 represses genes 
involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMGS1, SC4MOL) and 
HDL uptake (SRB1), and Mir223–/– mice display increased 
HDL-C levels, as well as hepatic and plasma total cholesterol.15 miR-27b is a cholesterol-responsive hepatic miRNA 
that represses many targets (PPARG, glycerol-3-phosphate 
acyltransferase mitochondrial [GPAM], angiopoietin like 3 
[ANGPTL3], and N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase [NDST1]) 
involved in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein remodeling.16 In 
addition to these gene network-regulating miRNAs, miR-30c 
was shown to have a potent effect on the production of apoB-
containing lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein and 
LDL). miR-30c targets the microsomal triglyceride transfer 
protein (MTTP), a protein essential for the lipidation of nascent 
apoB, and also reduces de novo lipogenesis by targeting lysophosphatidylglycerol
acyltransferase 1 (LPGAT1).17 Lentiviral 
overexpression of miR-30c in mice reduces the assembly and 
secretion of apoB lipoproteins,17 leading to decreased levels 
of plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C. Furthermore, studies 
in apoE-deficient mice (Apoe–/–) mice showed that miR-30c 
overexpression mitigated hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis 
without inducing steatosis,17 an undesirable side effect associated
with conventional MTTP inhibitors.
MiRNA regulation of plasma levels of LDL-C through 
targeting of the LDL receptor (LDLR) has also been reported. 
LDLR expression in the liver promotes the clearance of circulating
LDL particles and is a major determinant of plasma 
cholesterol levels. Two recent studies identified miR-148a 
as a negative regulator of LDLR expression and activity and 
showed that inhibition of miR-148a in mice could increase 
the clearance of circulating labeled LDL and decrease plasma 
LDL-C levels.18,19 Notably, single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
in the promoter region of miR-148A are associated with altered
LDL-C in humans,19 suggesting that altered expression 
of this miRNA may contribute to dyslipidemias. Indeed, analysis
of genome-wide association study data identified 3 other 
miRNAs predicted to target the LDLR (miR-128-1, miR-130b, 
and miR-301b) that lie in close proximity to human singlenucleotide
polymorphisms associated with abnormal levels 
of plasma lipids.19 Like miR-148a, inhibition of miR-128-1 
with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides increased 
hepatic LDLR expression and LDL clearance in mice.19 In 
addition to LDLR, miR-148a and miR-128-1 also target additional
genes involved in lipid and energy metabolism (miR-
148a: ATP-binding cassette [ABC] transporter A1 [ABCA1], 
5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase a1 
[AMPKa1], carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a [CPT1a], and 
salt-inducible kinase 1 [SIK1]; miR-128-1: ABCA1, sirtuin 1 
[SIRT1], and insulin receptor substrate 1),19 suggesting important
roles for these miRNAs in regulating metabolic pathways.
MiRNAs have also been identified to act as critical regulators
of HDL biogenesis and cholesterol efflux. These pathways 
control levels of plasma HDL-C and the reverse cholesterol 
transport pathway through which excess cholesterol is removed
to the liver for excretion. The ATP-binding cassette 
transporter, ABCA1, plays a central role in these processes by 
controlling cholesterol efflux across the cell membrane onto 
lipid-poor apoA120 to mediate both hepatic HDL biogenesis 
and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral cells, 
particularly Mø in atherosclerotic plaques. Many miRNAs 
have been identified that target ABCA1 to reduce cholesterol 
efflux to apoA1 in vitro, including miR-33,21–27 miR-758,28
miR-26,29 miR-106,30 miR-144,31,32 as well as the above-mentioned
miR-128-118 and miR-148a.19 Of these, inhibition of 
miR-33,21–27 miR-144,31,32 miR-128-1,18 and miR-148a19 has 
also been tested in vivo and shown to increase plasma levels of 
HDL-C in mice or monkeys. Circulating levels of HDL-C are 
also regulated by hepatic clearance via the scavenger receptor 
BI, which has been shown to be targeted by miR-223,33 miR-
455-5p,34 miR-96,33 miR-185,33 and miR-125a.34 However, 
only miR-223 has been manipulated in vivo and shown to impact
plasma HDL-C levels.15
Epidemiological studies have shown an atheroprotective 
role for HDL, which is thought to be associated with its ability
to mediate reverse cholesterol transport. Of the miRNAs 
targeting the HDL/reverse cholesterol transport pathway, the 
miR-33 family has been the most extensively studied in vivo 
using preclinical animal models. MiR-33a and miR-33b are 
intronic miRNAs that are coexpressed with their host genes, 
SREBF2 and SREBF1, which code for transcription factors that 
regulate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis/uptake.23–25 Thus, 
transcription of SREBF2 and SREBF1 also results in expression
of miR-33a and b, which cooperate with their host genes 
to balance cellular lipid levels by repressing genes that oppose 
SREBP-regulated pathways, such those involved in cholesterol
efflux (ABCA1 and ABCG1)23–25 and fatty acid oxidation 
(hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/
enoyl-CoA hydratase [trifunctional protein], beta subunit 
[HADHB], carnitine O-octanoyltransferase [CROT], CPT1a, 
and AMPKa1).21,28,35 Inhibition of miR-33 using modified antisense
or locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides increased hepatic ABCA1 expression and plasma HDL-C levels in both mice 
and monkeys by 40% to 50%,23–27,36 and enhanced cholesterol 
transport from macrophages to the plasma, liver, and feces by 
>80%.27 This increase in reverse cholesterol transport is likely 
the combined effects of derepression of ABCA1 and additional 
miR-33a/miR-33b targets such as Abcb11 and Atp8b1 that promote
cholesterol excretion into bile.37 Importantly, HDL isolated
from monkeys treated from with anti–miR-33 was shown 
to retain its anti-inflammatory properties, particularly its ability
to promote macrophage cholesterol efflux and to protect 
endothelial cells from cytokine-induced inflammation.27
Multiple studies of miR-33 inhibition or deletion have 
now been conducted in mouse models of atherosclerosis.

and reduced atherosclerotic plaque size in Apoe–/– mice.38
Furthermore, treatment of Ldlr–/– mice with established atherosclerosis
with a miR-33 inhibitor for 4 weeks, in conjunction
with a chow diet, increased plasma levels of HDL-C and 
markedly regressed atherosclerosis.27 Notably, this intervention
study was designed to simulate a clinical scenario, where 
plasma LDL-C levels were lowered in conjunction with anti–
miR-33 treatment. However, 2 subsequent studies evaluating 
the effects of miR-33 inhibitors in Ldlr–/– mice on a Western 
diet showed no effects on HDL-C levels, presumably because 
of decreased hepatic expression of SREBF2/miR-33 under 
these conditions.39,40 Despite this, Rotllan et al39 observed 
reductions in aortic atherosclerotic lesion area after 8 weeks 
of anti–miR-33 treatment, suggesting that miR-33 inhibition 
may have atheroprotective effects beyond raising HDL. This 
paradox may be explained by a recent report that miR-33 
can also instruct macrophage inflammatory polarization by 
altering the balance of cellular aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation.41 Targeted deletion or 
inhibition of miR-33 in macrophages increases oxidative respiration
—a metabolic program characteristic of alternatively 
activated macrophages—and induces the expression of genes 
that define M2 macrophage polarization. Notably, inhibition 
of miR-33 also increased macrophage expression of the retinoic
acid–producing enzyme Aldh1a2 and retinal dehydrogenase
activity both in vitro and in vivo. Retinoic acid can foster 
the differentiation of atheroprotective regulatory T cells, and 
consistent with this, Ldlr–/– mice treated with miR-33 inhibitors
for 8 weeks on Western diet showed the accumulation of 
M2 macrophages and FoxP3+ T regulatory cells in plaques 
and reduced atherosclerosis progression in the absence of 
changes of plasma HDL.41 This study suggests that antagonism
of miR-33 is atheroprotective, in part, by promoting M2 
macrophage and regulatory T-cell polarization to suppress 
plaque inflammation.
Despite the beneficial effects of miR-33 inhibition on 
plasma levels of HDL-C and atherosclerosis, some studies of 
genetic deletion42 or antagonism of miR-3343 in conjunction 
with Western diet feeding have reported an increase in circulating
triglycerides and hepatosteatosis. Not all studies have 
observed these effects of miR-33 inhibitors in mice,44 and increases
in triglycerides or hepatic lipid levels have not been 
reported in studies of nonhuman primates treated with anti–
miR-33 for >16 weeks.26,36 These conflicting findings suggest 
that more studies of miR-33 are warranted, particularly to 
understand whether effects on triglycerides and hepatosteatosis
are species specific or because of potential differences of 
chemical modifications, delivery, or time of administration 
of anti–miR-33 oligonucleotides. Nonetheless, these studies 
highlight the potential utility of miRNA mimics and inhibitors 
in the treatment of dyslipidemias (Figure 1).
MiRNA Regulation of Endothelial Cell 
Inflammation and Plaque Progression
Sustained hyperlipidemia and altered shear stress predispose
the vessel wall to atherosclerotic lesion formation. In 
response to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, endothelial
cells undergo a series of molecular and cellular conformational
changes that promote atherogenesis. For example, 
early induction of adhesion molecule expression such as vascular
adhesion molecule-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, 
and E-selectin facilitates leukocyte recruitment to the vessel 
wall and may be among the earliest hallmarks associated with 
nascent plaques.45 Several miRNAs have been implicated in 
atherogenesis by virtue of their ability to directly target the 3′-
UTRs of these molecules such as miR-17-3p (targets intracellular
adhesion molecule-1) and miR-31 (targets E-selectin).46
However, the functional role of both these miRNAs in experimental
atherosclerosis remains unknown. Nuclear factor (NF)-
κB signaling is a major pathway that activates not only these 
proadhesive molecules but also a range of other proinflammatory
and prothrombotic factors. MiR-181b and miR-146a are 
2 cytokine-responsive miRNAs that regulate distinct components
of NF-κB signaling and are atheroprotective47 (Figure 2).
Cytokine-Responsive MiRNAs That Regulate 
Atherosclerosis
MiR-181b
Accumulating studies in mice and human subjects highlight 
a critical role for miR-181b as an inhibitor of endothelial inflammatory
responses by targeting NF-κB signaling in both 
acute (eg, sepsis) and chronic (eg, atherosclerosis) vascular 
disease states.48,49 MiR-181b, an intergenic miRNAs,50 inhibits
NF-κB signaling uniquely in endothelial cells but not 
in leukocytes by targeting importin-α3, a protein important 
for NF-κB cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. In leukocytes, 
the dominant isoform that mediates NF-κB nuclear import 
is importin-α5, which miR-181b does not target thereby 
leaving leukocyte NF-κB signaling intact. Nonetheless, 
on systemic intravenous delivery, miR-181b decreased endothelial
NF-κB activation, an effect that was sufficient to 
markedly suppress leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerotic
lesion formation in atherosclerotic-prone ApoE−/− mice. 
Importantly, the miR-181b antiatherosclerotic effects were 
independent of any changes in lipid profiles. These findings 
are consistent with endothelial-specific NF-κB (I-kappaB 
kinase [IKKγ]) knockout and dominant-negative IκBα
transgenic mice that also exhibit protection against atherosclerotic
lesion formation.51 A range of proinflammatory 
stimuli (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, lipopolysaccharide
) reduce miR-181b expression in endothelial cells in 
vitro. In vivo, miR-181b expression is reduced by 53% in 
the vascular endothelium and by ≈40% in plasma of mice 
after just 4 weeks of high cholesterol diet in ApoE−/− mice, 
suggesting that loss of homeostatic control of miR-181b expression
may predispose to inflammation in the vessel wall. 
In line with these observations, miR-181b expression is also 
reduced in plasma of human subjects with angiographically 
defined coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with those 
without CAD.49 Therapeutically, the cell-specific miR-181b 
inhibitory effects on NF-κB in the vascular endothelium, and 
not in myeloid cells, may be advantageous to maintain optimal
protection in response to infectious pathogens. Indeed, 
miR-181b delivery also inhibits endothelial inflammation 
and confers protection against sepsis in mice.48 Collectively, 
these findings provide cogent evidence that miR-181b serves 
as an important regulator of NF-κB signaling in the vascular

endothelium in response to diverse stimuli and provide new 
opportunities for anti-inflammatory replacement therapy.
MiR-146a
MiR-146a is another cytokine-responsive miRNAs that confers 
atheroprotective properties in the vessel wall. Cytokines such 
as TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-1β induced expression of miR-
146a and miR-146b in a delayed kinetic manner in endothelial 
cells (ECs) that coincided with the resolution of inflammatory 
gene expression.52 MiR-146a overexpression inhibited cytokine 
responsiveness in ECs, suggesting that it may participate in a 
negative feedback mechanism to limit EC inflammatory signaling.
Interestingly, miR-146a expression is also increased in 
human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques.53 Indeed, miR-146a 
repressed both NF-κB and mitogen activated kinase-like protein
(MAPK) signaling pathways by directly targeting HuR, 
an RNA-binding protein that exerts inhibitory effects on endothelial
nitric oxide synthase. In addition, miR-146a represses 
the induction of EC adhesion molecules by targeting upstream 
adaptor proteins TNF receptor–associated factor 6 and interleukin
1 receptor associated kinase 1 or 2 (IRAK1/2).52 In contrast 
to the more selective inhibitory role of miR-181b on EC NF-
κB signaling, miR-146a inhibits NF-κB signaling in both ECs 
and macrophages.54 Indeed, overexpression of ApoE in ApoE−/−
macrophages induced miR-146a expression to reduce macrophage
proinflammatory responses and systemic delivery of 
miR-146a mimics markedly reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression.
The specific cell subsets (eg, ECs or leukocytes) and 
mechanisms (eg, NF-κB dependent or NF-κB independent) by 
which miR-146a confers these favorable effects in experimental 
atherosclerosis will require additional study. However, given the 
anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a in regulating a range of immune
cells (macrophages, dendritic cells [DCs], and T cells),55
it may participate more broadly to limit inflammatory stimuli. 
Nevertheless, miR-146 is another important cytokine-responsive 
miRNA that may serve to dampen EC inflammation in a negative
feedback manner.
Mechanosensitive EC MiRNAs That Regulate 
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop at arterial 
branch points, bifurcations, and the lesser curvature of the 
Figure 1. MicroRNA (miRNA) orchestration of cholesterol homeostasis and macrophage activation in atherosclerosis. In the liver, 
miRNAs repress the expression of genes involved in lipoprotein packaging and secretion (eg, miR-30c and miR-27b), uptake (eg, miRNAs 
targeting LDLR and SRB1), and cholesterol efflux (eg, miRNA targeting ATP-binding cassette [ABC] transporter A1 [ABCA1]). MiRNA 
repression of ABCA1 decreases cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). 
As the nascent HDL particle mediates free cholesterol (FC) uptake and remodels because of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) 
conversion of FC to cholesterol ester (CE), secreted miRNAs, such as miR-223, miR-92a, and miR-126, are detected on the mature HDL 
particles. The HDL-carried miRNAs can mediate extracellular signaling by repressing genes in target tissues and HDL interaction with 
macrophages and endothelial cells may also result in miRNA exchange (ie, pick-up or delivery via scavenger receptor B1 [SR-B1]). MiRNA 
targeting of SR-B1 and the ABC11 and ATP8B1 transporters reduce selective cholesterol uptake by the liver and excretion, respectively. In 
macrophages, miRNA targeting of ABCA1 reduces cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport back to the liver. In addition, miRNAs 
regulate the polarization of macrophages toward classical M1 (eg, miR-33 and miR-155) or alternative M2 (eg, miR-223 and miR-27a) 
inflammatory activation and also regulate lipoprotein uptake and foam cell formation (Illustration Credit: Ben Smith). ANGPTL3 indicates

aorta in mice and human subjects.56–58 These findings are explained
, in part, by the presence of disturbed flow (d-flow) 
in these regions, which increases endothelial permeability 
(eg, by altering the expression and localization of intracellular
junctional proteins) and proinflammatory signaling (eg, 
NF-κB activation, adhesion molecule expression), thereby 
promoting leukocyte accumulation and lesion formation.59–62
In contrast, laminar flow (l-flow) confers anti-inflammatory, 
antiadhesive, and antithrombotic properties in the vessel wall. 
A surprisingly large number of miRNAs have been identified 
as shear stress responsive by either d-flow or l-flow.
MiR-92
MiR-92a, a member of the miR-17 to miR-92 cluster, is expressed
highly in endothelial cells and dynamically regulated 
by shear stress both in vitro and in vivo.63,64 On exposure of 
ECs to pulsatile l-flow in vitro, miR-92a expression is reduced, 
whereas d-flow increases its expression; in addition, miR-92a 
bound to the 3′-UTR of Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a flowresponsive
transcription factor, suggesting a direct role for 
regulating l-flow.63 Similarly, in vivo miR-92a expression is 
highly induced in atheroprone areas of the aortic arch when 
compared with atheroresistant regions.65 In vitro studies suggest
that miR-92a overexpression suppresses the 3′-UTRs of 
KLF2 and KLF4. In contrast, miR-92a–mediated inhibition 
of TNF-α-induced cytokines and leukocyte adhesion can be 
rescued, in part, by KLF4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), 
indicating partial KLF4 dependency.65 In a separate microarray
profiling studies, Loyer et al64 identified that on exposure of 
ECs to oxidized LDL and low shear stress, expression of miR-
92a and proinflammatory markers (monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 and IL-6) is increased in a STAT3-dependent manner.
Overexpression of miR-92a in ECs reduced expression of 
KLF2 and KLF4, flow-responsive transcription factors, whereas
miR-92a antagonism reduced EC inflammation as reflected 
by lower phospho-p65 expression. Mechanistically, miR-92a 
also targets suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-5 in ECs 
in the presence of oxidized LDL and low shear stress conditions.64 Although the in vivo role of SOCS5 in atherosclerosis 
remains unclear, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SOCS5 increased
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-6 expression
in ECs without affecting the expression of endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase, KLF2, or KLF4. In addition, neutralization
of miR-92a in LDLR−/− mice decreased EC inflammation
and suppressed the progression of atherosclerotic lesion 
formation. Moreover, mice harboring a genetic deletion of 
miR-92a in Tie2-expressing endothelial cells were protected 
from neointimal formation after mechanical arterial injury,

Figure 2. Endothelial microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate vascular inflammation. In response to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli, 
miRNAs regulate specific targets in endothelial cells (ECs) that alter the balance of pro- or anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. Biochemical 
stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α reduces the expression of miR-181b, whereas it increases the expression of miR-146. MiR-
181b targets importin-α3 in ECs, an effect that prevents cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family members, 
p50 and p65, thereby reducing NF-κB–responsive gene expression such as adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-
1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), or E-selectin. Induction of miR-146 targets the 3′-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), to regulate upstream NF-κB signaling and 
targets HuR, which regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. The expression of miR-92a and miR-712 is increased in 
response to disturbed flow (d-flow), whereas miR-126-5p expression is reduced. miR-92a targets the transcription factors Kruppel-like factor 
2 (KLF2) and 4 (KLF4), and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS5) expression, an effect that decreases anti-inflammatory pathways and 
increases monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 that further promote EC activation. miR-712 suppresses tissue 
inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), thereby increasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and MMP 
(ADAMs). In contrast, d-flow reduces expression of miR-126-5p, thereby derepressing its target gene delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk-1), a negative 
regulator of endothelial cell proliferation. Laminar flow induces the expression of the miR-143/miR-145 cluster, which may be packaged and 
released extracellularly in microvesicles and taken-up by neighboring vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Conversely, ECs may enable 
the passage of miR-143 and miR-145 released from VSMCs through specialized membrane protrusions known as tunneling nanotubes. HKII

attributed, in part, to enhanced re-endothelialization.66 Given 
the protective role of miR-92a-deficiency in other processes 
including re-endothelialization after mechanical arterial wire 
injury66,67 and angiogenesis after myocardial or peripheral 
ischemia,68,69 targeting this miR-92a may hold promise for a 
range of cardiovascular-relevant disease states.
MiR-126
MiR-126 is among the most abundantly expressed miRNAs 
in ECs and has been implicated in regulating both inflammation
and angiogenesis in a flow-dependent manner. MiR-
126 was initially described in vitro to bind to the 3′-UTR of 
vascular adhesion molecule-1 to limit leukocyte adhesion.70
Subsequent studies revealed that miR-126–deficient mice exhibit
impaired vascular integrity and defects in EC proliferation
and angiogenesis.71 Indeed, miR-126 may be induced by 
KLF2 to control flow-dependent angiogenesis.72 In the context 
of atherosclerosis, Zernecke et al73 demonstrated that miR-
126 was the most abundant miRNA expressed in EC-derived 
apoptotic bodies where it induced CXCL12 expression by 
targeting RGS16, a negative regulator of stromal cell-derived 
factor 1/C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (SDF-1/CXCR4)  signaling
and progenitor cell mobilization. Consistent with this 
pathway, intravenous delivery of endothelial apoptotic bodies
mobilized progenitor cells in the circulation and enhanced 
their incorporation into aortic plaques, an effect that suppressed
atherosclerotic progression in a miR-126–dependent 
manner. Within the vascular endothelium, Schober et al74 elegantly
identified a functional role for the passenger strand, 
miR-126-5p, as a flow-responsive miRNA that is suppressed 
by d-flow, an effect that facilitates lesion formation through 
induction of a negative regulator of EC proliferation termed 
delta-like 1 homolog. Systemic delivery of miR-126-5p mimics
rescued EC proliferation at vulnerable sites and inhibited 
lesion progression.74 Because the proinflammatory transcription
factors Ets-1 and Ets-2 also induce miR-126 expression
,75 the miR-126 duplex may mechanistically serve to limit 
proinflammatory factors such as TNF-α and angiotensin-II 
in a negative feedback manner in the vascular endothelium. 
However, ECs exposed to l-flow–induced KLF2-dependent 
expression of pri–miR-126 but not of miR-126-3p. Moreover, 
miR-126-5p expression, but not miR-126-3p expression, was 
lower at predilection sites of ApoE−/− aortas. In addition, delivery
of miR-126-5p antago-miRs, but not of miR-126-3p 
antago-miRs, increased lesion formation after EC denudation 
in ApoE−/− mice, suggesting that miR-126-3p may not be implicated
in flow-responsive vascular protection. Finally, atheroprotective
l-flow increases the release of miR-126 bound 
to Argonaute2 into extracellular microvesicles that serves as 
a mediator to increase vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 
turnover by targeting genes (eg, FOXO3, B-cell lymphoma 6, 
and insulin receptor substrate 1) implicated in maintaining an 
atheroprotective VSMC contractile phenotype.76 In this study, 
miR-126 deficiency inhibited neointimal formation of mouse 
carotid arteries induced by cessation of blood flow, an effect 
rescued by miR-126 mimics or by conditioned media from 
static EC monocultures. These latter findings raise the possibility
that despite its atheroprotective in ECs, miR-126 may 
thin SMCs of the fibrous plaque leading to destabilization. 
Future long-term studies will be required to assess the relative
role of the miR-126-5p/miR-126-3p duplex in response to 
a range of important biochemical and biomechanical stimuli 
and in different phases of atherosclerosis.
MiR-712/MiR-205
Although miRNA biogenesis typically uses the canonical 
Drosha/DGCR8 and Dicer miRNA pathway, accumulating 
studies also highlight an important role for noncanonical pathways
for miRNA maturation.77,78 miR-712 (human homologue 
miR-205) was identified as a d-flow responsive miRNA derived
from noncanonical preribosomal RNA (using the RN45S
gene).79 Functionally, d-flow–induced miR-712 targets tissue 
inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, an effect that increases matrix
metalloproteinases and a disintegrin and MMPs to stimulate
proinflammatory EC responses. Indeed, neutralization 
of miR-712 derepresses TIMP3 expression and ameliorates 
atherosclerotic progression in mice.79 Additional studies will 
be required to determine whether the in vivo neutralization of 
miR-712 directly affects other relevant cell types, such as immune
subsets and vascular smooth muscle cells.
MiR-143/MiR-145
An emerging paradigm in cell-to-cell communication is the 
ability of miRNAs to be transferred from one cell to another 
within tissues. For example, in response to l-flow or KLF2 
overexpression in ECs, extracellular microvesicles containing
miR-143 and miR-145 are released that confer atheroprotective
properties in adjacent VSMCs. Intravenous 
delivery of these extracellular vesicles also blocked atherosclerotic
lesion progression in a miR-143/145–dependent
manner.80 Interestingly, miR-143/miR-145, which 
are expressed higher in VSMCs compared to ECs under 
basal conditions in vitro, may also participate in VSMC 
to EC communication via intercellular tubes called tunneling
nanotubes in vitro.81 In support of this VSMC to 
EC passage, SMC-specific deletion of the miR-143/miR-
145 cluster in mice effectively blocked the induction of 
miR-143/miR-145 expression in coronary artery endothelial
cells in response to transaortic constriction–induced 
pressure overload, an effect that may be mediated by the 
activation of the transforming growth factor-β signaling 
pathway and the miR-143/miR-145 targets hexokinase II 
and integrin-β8.81 Collectively, although it remains to be 
determined whether bidirectional extracellular miRNA 
passage occurs between SMC and EC under atherosclerotic
conditions, these findings raise the provocative question 
of skewed, preferential cell-to-cell miRNA shifts that may 
emerge under atherosclerotic progression or regression, or 
in response to pharmacological therapies.
Others: MiR-10a, MiR-663, MiR-155, and MiR-30-5p
Several other mechanosensitive miRNAs, such as miR-10a, 
miR-663, and miR-155, have been identified using a variety
of profiling approaches. However, the functional role of 
these 3 miRNAs in regulating experimental atherosclerosis 
in mice has not yet been validated (miR-10a and miR-663) 
or remains unclear (miR-155). Nonetheless, they may figure 
prominently at predilection sites in the macrovasculature.

inner aortic arch of pig, an atherosusceptible region, and ECs 
from the descending thoracic aorta revealed that miR-10a 
expression was significantly reduced in the atherosusceptible 
regions.82 Mechanistically, miR-10a targets the 3′-UTRs of 
MAPK kinase kinase 7 and the β-transducin repeat–containing
gene, 2 key regulators of IκBα degradation. Indeed, 
miR-10a overexpression inhibits canonical NF-κB signaling
in ECs in vitro.82 Therapeutic manipulation of miR-10a 
in atherosclerotic-prone mice will be required to assess its 
relative contribution to EC function at predilection sites and 
lesion pathogenesis. Because miR-10a’s family member, 
miR-10b, which may also bind to similar consensus sites in 
target genes, has been implicated in promoting tumor invasion
and metastasis, delivery of miR-10 mimetics may require
close scrutiny for therapeutic gain. Another miRNA, 
miR-663, was identified by 2 groups as a d-flow–induced 
miRNA in ECs.79,83 Interestingly, human miR-663, such as 
miR-712, may also be derived from the same ribosomal RNA 
gene, RN45S. Because the XRN1 exonuclease can rapidly 
degrade the spacer regions from where this rRNA is derived, 
Son et al79 examined whether silencing XRN1 may affect 
miR-663 and miR-712 expression. Indeed, d-flow reduced 
XRN1 expression in predilection regions in the mouse carotid
and aortic arch, and XRN1 deficiency in ECs in vitro 
significantly increased both miR-663 and miR-712 expression
, suggesting another level of regulation and therapeutic 
modulation of atypical mechanosensitive miRNAs in the vascular
endothelium. Finally, miR-155 is increased by l-flow in 
ECs and in the thoracic aorta when compared with the lower 
aortic arch.74 Mechanistic studies indicate that miR-155 may 
bind to both anti-inflammatory targets (eg, endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase) and proinflammatory targets (eg, myosin 
light chain kinase, RhoA, SOCS-1, and Bcl6).74,84–86 Studies 
examining the role for miR-155 in experimental atherosclerosis
in mice highlight both pro- and antiatherosclerosis effects
depending on the context. For example, LDLR−/− mice 
harboring bone marrow with miR-155 deficiency exhibited 
increased atherosclerosis with reduced plaque stability.87 In 
contrast, miR-155 deficiency in macrophages reduced atherosclerotic
plaque size in ApoE−/− mice, an effect thought to be 
mediated by miR-155’s ability to target B-cell lymphoma 6 
and, in turn, reduced C-C ligand 2 (CCL2)-mediated macrophage
recruitment.86 Moreover, miR-155 delivery in vivo 
reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation, an effect that may 
be mediated by targeting MAP3K10.88 Because miR-155 also 
targets myosin light chain kinase in endothelial cells,74 and 
myosin light chain kinase deficiency in ApoE−/− mice reduces 
atherosclerosis by improving endothelial barrier dysfunction
and monocyte migration,89 EC-derived miR-155 may 
be viewed as a potentially protective miRNA in the vessel 
wall. In line with this hypothesis, miR-155 expression is significantly
higher in the thoracic aorta, an area associated with 
unidirectional shear stress, than in the lower curvature of the 
aortic arch, a region associated with low shear stress.89 These 
findings raise nuanced questions for miR-155 in vascular inflammation
, and additional studies will be required to define 
the EC- and macrophage-specific roles of miR-155 in atherogenesis.
Finally, l-flow shear stress or KLF2 overexpression 
in ECs induce members of the miR-30-5p family that, in turn, 
decrease anti-inflammatory markers such as vascular adhesion
molecule-1 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by 
targeting angiopoietin-2.90 However, a role for miR-30-5p 
family members in regulating endothelial inflammation and 
atherosclerosis in mice will require future investigation.
MiRNAs Regulating Leukocyte Recruitment 
and Activation in Atherosclerosis
Immune responses critically shape atherogenesis. One of the 
earliest pathogenic events in atherosclerosis is the recruitment 
of monocytes from the circulation to the artery wall in areas 
of endothelial dysfunction and lipoprotein retention. On differentiation
into macrophages, these cells play central roles 
in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by maintaining lipid 
homeostasis in the vessel wall and secreting inflammationpromoting
mediators that act on both immune and nonimmune
cell types in the artery wall.91 Lipoprotein uptake by 
macrophages in the nascent plaque results in the formation 
of lipid-laden macrophage foam cells that are hallmarks of 
atherosclerosis.91 For reasons that are poorly understood, these 
macrophage foam cells persist in the artery wall, setting off 
a maladaptive immune response that promotes the formation 
of plaques. These macrophages are a source of inflammatory 
mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, that mediate 
the recruitment and activation of other immune cells, thereby 
chronically sustaining the inflammation that fuels plaque progression.
MiRNAs can impact each of these key macrophage 
processes to influence the progression of atherosclerosis.
Macrophage cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by 
the balance between cholesterol uptake, endogenous synthesis
, esterification/hydrolysis, and efflux. Many miRNAs 
have been implicated in macrophage cholesterol metabolism. 
miR-27a/b, discussed above with regard to lipoprotein homeostasis
, can regulate macrophage cholesterol homeostasis
by targeting genes involved in cholesterol esterification 
(ACAT1), uptake (LDL and CD36), and efflux (ABCA1).92
miR-125a-5p and miR-146a decrease lipid uptake and cytokine
release in oxidized LDL–stimulated macrophages, in 
part, by targeting the genes oxysterol binding protein-like 9 
and TLR4, respectively.93,94 In addition, miR-155 may also 
regulate macrophage foam cell formation by targeting the 
transcriptional repressor HMG box-transcriptional protein 
1, which negatively regulates macrophage inhibitory factor, 
a protein known to increase the uptake of oxidized LDL by 
macrophages.95 Furthermore, numerous miRNAs have now 
been identified that promote foam cell formation by inhibiting 
macrophage cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, including miR-
26,29 miR-33,23–25 miR-106,30 miR-144,31,32 miR-128-1,18 miR-
130b,18 miR-148a,18 miR-301b,18 miR-302a,96 and miR-758.28
This high degree of miRNA targeting of ABCA1 points to the 
need for careful fine-tuning of macrophage cholesterol efflux 
to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.
In response to microenvironmental signals, macrophages 
can initiate different activation programs, including the classical
proinflammatory phenotype (also called M1) and the 
alternatively activated M2 phenotype associated with an 
anti-inflammatory profile. Atherosclerosis progression is

associated with the predominance of an M1 macrophage phenotype
in the plaque, whereas plaques undergoing regression 
are enriched in M2 macrophages.91 A growing list of miRNAs 
is implicated in regulating the balance between the M1 and 
M2 phenotypes, including miR-let7a,97 miR-19a,98 miR-21,99
miR-27a,100 miR-33,41 miR-124,101 miR-125a,102 miR-146a,103
miR-155,104 miR-214,105 and miR-223.106 However, few of 
these have been investigated in the context of atherosclerosis.
Of note, miR-33, which plays a central role in regulating 
cholesterol efflux, also regulates macrophage cellular metabolism
to alter the cell’s inflammatory phenotype. miR-33 reduces
fatty acid oxidation, the metabolic program that fuels 
M2 macrophages, and promotes aerobic glycolysis, which in 
turn sustains the inflammatory M1-like macrophage phenotype.41 Inhibition of miR-33 metabolically reprograms plaque 
macrophages to the M2 phenotype involved in resolving inflammation
and tissue repair, which in turn promotes the accumulation
of atheroprotective T-regulatory cells. miR-155, 
which as described above has a controversial role in atherosclerosis
, can also reprogram macrophages from the M2 to 
M1 phenotype, and thus may play a role in the accumulation 
of M1 macrophages.104 miR-155 expression is significantly 
higher in CD14+ monocytes from patients with CAD than 
from healthy controls and is induced by oxidized forms of 
LDL in macrophages.95 miR-155 acts to repress negative regulators
of inflammatory cytokine signaling, such as SOCS1, 
Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1, 
or B-cell lymphoma 6, and thereby promoting the release 
of proinflammatory mediators.74,84–86 Conversely, miR-223, 
which regulates lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver,15
can suppress M1 proinflammatory pathways and enhance alternative
activation, in part, by targeting Pknox1.106 Finally, 
miR-27a, which also plays a role in macrophage foam cell formation
, can promote markers of M2 macrophages (eg, CD206 
and DC-SIGN) and secretion of IL-10.100
Other miRNAs have been implicated in enhancing or reducing
macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. For 
example, miR-147 and miR-21 attenuate TLR-associated 
signaling events in macrophages to limit inflammation.107,108
Likewise, miR-146a/b is induced in macrophages in an NF-
κB–dependent manner and are involved in inflammation resolution
by limiting Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling. 
Recently, the expression of miR-146a was shown to be induced
in macrophages by apoE, a protein with antiatherosclerotic
properties, and to suppress macrophage inflammatory 
responses in vitro and in vivo.54 Furthermore, the transcription 
factor KLF2, whose expression in macrophages protects from 
atherosclerosis, downregulates expression of proatherosclerotic
chemokines (eg, CCL2 and C-X-C ligand 1 [CXCL1]) 
by increasing expression of miR-124a and miR-150.109 During 
early atherogenesis, one of the most prominently induced 
miRNAs in lesional macrophages is miR-342-5p.110 This miRNA
enhances the production of macrophage inflammatory mediators
such as iNOS and IL-6 by suppressing Akt1-mediated 
suppression of miR-155. Accordingly, inhibition of miR-342-
5p in Apoe–/– mice reduces atherosclerosis progression.110
Other immune cells, such as DCs and T cells, also participate
in atherogenesis and the regulation of plaque 
inflammation. By sensing and presenting antigens in the 
plaque, DCs are positioned at the crossroad of innate and 
adaptive immune responses.
Furthermore, T-cell (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg) and B-cell 
subpopulations can modulate atherosclerosis development. 
Thus, miRNAs that regulate immune cell differentiation and 
function would be expected to have wide-ranging effects on 
plaque evolution. An atlas of miRNA expression patterns in 
human T- and B-cell subsets was recently completed,111 and 
their roles in regulating T- and B-cell differentiation, activation
, and function were recently reviewed.112 However 
to date, miRNA regulation of these immune cell subsets in 
atherosclerosis has been underexplored when compared with 
macrophages.
Notably, several miRNAs shown to regulate atherogenic 
processes in macrophages have also been implicated in DC 
function. For example, miR-155 is required for efficient DC 
maturation by targeting the transcription factor c-Fos,113 and 
its expression increases TLR/IL-1 and type I interferon signaling
pathways in human monocyte-derived DCs required to 
promote antigen-specific T-cell activation.114–116 Furthermore, 
like its role in macrophages, miR-146a reduces TLR signaling 
and cytokine production in DCs, thereby regulating DC activation.117 Moreover, miR-148/miR-152 inhibits the production 
of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-α) 
by targeting calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 
alpha (CaMKIIα), consequently reducing DC-triggered antigen-specific
T-cell proliferation.118 By regulating activation of 
DCs and their interactions with T and B cells in plaques, these 
miRNAs are likely to impact the inflammatory milieu of the 
plaque and atherosclerosis progression.
MiRNAs Implicated in Vascular Smooth 
Muscle Function and Atherosclerosis
VSMCs contribute to the maintenance of vascular wall function
by assuming a differentiated, contractile phenotype. In 
response to vascular injury, VSMCs undergo a switch to a 
synthetic phenotype, an effect that induces signals that promote
migration, proliferation, and inflammation.119 Several 
miRNAs have been implicated in regulating important VSMC 
nodal regulators such as the transcription factors (serum-response
factor [eg, serum response factor/KLF4], coactivators 
[eg, myocardin], transforming growth factor-β signaling effectors
[eg, Smads], or cytokines/growth factors [eg, plateletderived
growth factor (PDGF)]). Although the traditional view 
of VSMCs in vascular injury states is that they dedifferentiate 
to assume a synthetic, proliferative state,120 recent studies have 
broadened this concept to suggest that VSMCs may adopt a reprogrammed
transdifferentiated macrophage phenotype.120,121
Although the role of miRNAs has emerged as important players
in the former, their role in VSMC-to-macrophage transdifferentiation
in vivo remains relatively unexplored.121a We 
summarize below major miRNA regulators implicated in 
VSMC and atherosclerotic lesion formation (Figure 3).
MiR-143/MiR-145
The miRNAs miR-143 and miR-145 are cotranscribed as a 
single primary-miR transcript because of their close proximity 
and are among the highest expressed miRNAs in VSMCs and

the medial layer of the vessel wall.122 Indeed, these miRNAs 
are reduced in the vessel wall in response to vascular injury or 
the presence of atherosclerosis.123,124 A series of gain- and lossof-function
studies suggest that miR-143/miR-145 are major 
regulators of VSMC contractile function. Indeed, miR-143–/
miR-145–deficient mice exhibit VSMCs with reduced SMC 
contractile marker expression and function, impaired actin 
stress fibers and cytoskeletal dynamics, and decreased vessel 
wall medial thickness.123–125 These miR-143–/miR-145–deficient
mice also had reduced blood pressure at baseline and in 
response to vasopressor challenge, an effect that the authors 
attributed to reduced expression of the target gene angiotensin-converting
enzyme.126 Conversely, delivery of miR-145 
in ApoE−/− mice using a lentivirus under the control of the 
SMC-specific SM22α promoter significantly reduced atherosclerotic
plaque size and promoted a more favorable plaque 
composition with increased fibrous cap area and plaque collagen
content and reduced necrotic core area and macrophage 
accumulation.127 Consistent with miR-145’s known role in promoting
a contractile phenotype in VSMCs, these atherosclerotic-stabilizing
effects were mechanistically related to reduced 
KLF4 and increased myocardin expression in the vessel wall 
of ApoE−/− mice.127 Analogous protective effects of miR-145 
have been observed in response to neointimal vascular lesion 
formation.128 In addition to KLF4 and myocardin, miR-143/
miR-145 have been shown to target several other key transcriptional
regulators implicated in modulation of VSMC differentiation
, such as ETS domain-containing protein-1 (ELK-1) and 
KLF5.123,124,129 Because upstream control of miR-143/miR-145 
expression is governed, in part, by serum response factor, 
Nkx2.5, and myocardin, miR-143/miR-145 may contribute to 
fine-tuning a SMC-specific transcriptional program important 
in regulating the contractile VSMC state.
MiR-221/MiR-222
In contrast to miR-143/miR-145, the miRNAs, miR-221 and 
miR-222, are increased in response to injury in neointimal lesions.130 In vitro studies have implicated miR-221/miR-222 in 
regulating PDGF-mediated VSMC proliferation. PDGF induced 
miR-221/miR-222 in VSMCs, an effect leading to reduced expression
of its target genes c-Kit and p27Kip1 and decreased 
SMC-specific contractile gene expression.131 Using miR-221/
miR-222 knockdown approaches, in vivo studies demonstrated 
that miR-221 and miR-222 deficiency reduced VSMC proliferation
and neointimal lesion formation after mechanical injury by 
targeting p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2).130 In human atherosclerotic 
lesions, reduced expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was noted 
in the shoulder of plaques from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy
caused by an acute neurological event occurring 
within 5 days of the carotid endarterectomy. Although this study 
demonstrated a compelling association of reduced miR-221/
miR-222 with unstable lesions, it also revealed that the target 
gene p27(Kip1) was significantly increased.132 Interestingly, 
miR-222 expression in isolated human ECs decreased from early
lesions to advanced plaques.133 Collectively, these studies provide
accumulating evidence that miR-221/miR-222 may play a 
destabilizing role in atherosclerotic lesions.

(ELK-1) important for VSMC phenotypic switching from a contractile, mature, and differentiated cell type to a dedifferentiated synthetic, 
and proliferative cell type. In addition, miR-143/miR-145 target genes important to the regulation of blood pressure such as angiotensinconverting
enzyme (ACE). In contrast, vascular wall injury increases expression of miR-221 and miR-222, an effect that decreases the 
expression of the cell cycle regulator c-Kit, p27(Kip1), and p57(Kip2). Induction of miR-21 expression targets phosphatase and tensin 
homolog (PTEN), thereby increasing the antiapoptotic regulator B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Microvesicles or exosomes released by 
neighboring endothelial cells, and carrying miRNAs such as miR-143/miR-145 or miR-126 (bound to Argonaute2 [Ago2]), may be taken up by 
VSMCs enabling suppression of target genes and altering VSMC functional responses. BCL2 indicates B-cell lymphoma 2; EC, endothelial 
cell; FOXO3, Forkhead Box O3; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; SM, smooth muscle; and SMMHC, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain.

MiR-21
Although miR-21 has been implicated in promoting VSMC 
proliferation in response to a range of vascular mechanical
injury models, its role remains to be defined in atherosclerotic
lesion formation. Neutralization of miR-21 reduced 
neointimal lesion formation in response to mechanical balloon 
injury.128 In keeping with its role in regulating VSMC contractile
phenotype, miR-21 expression increased significantly
in isolated dedifferentiated VSMCs when compared with 
mature differentiated VSMCs. Consistent with these findings 
for miR-21 in rodent vascular injury, delivery of an anti–miR-
21-coated stent into balloon-injured human internal mammary 
arteries using a humanized rat model also revealed protective 
effects on neointimal lesion formation.134 Mechanistically, 
miR-21’s proliferative properties may be because of its ability 
to target phosphatase and tensin homolog in VSMCs and indirectly increase the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2.128 Furthermore, 
miR-21 mediates the induction of the VSMC contractile phenotype
by transforming growth factor-β and BMP signaling in 
a unique post-transcriptional processing step implicating that 
Smad proteins may control DROSHA-regulated maturation 
of miRNAs.135 Additional studies will be required to assess 
whether the antiproliferative effects of miR-21 neutralization 
also reduce atherosclerotic progression in nonmechanically 
injury vessels.
MiRNAs as Diagnostic Markers of 
Atherosclerotic Disease Severity
Accumulating studies implicate miRNAs as potential 
diagnostic or prognostic markers in a range of disease states. 
Because circulating miRNAs can be detected in peripheral 
blood, saliva, and urine, their expression may be harbingers 
of various stages of CAD from subclinical atherosclerotic 
disease to acute coronary syndromes. Herein, we summarize 
the profiling of several studies linking specific miRNAs to 
atherosclerotic disease burden as primarily diagnostic markers.
Additional studies will be required to further define these 
miRNAs for their prognostic significance in CAD.
Stable CAD
One of the earliest studies that analyzed miRNAs from plasma 
of 8 stable CAD subjects and healthy controls examined candidate
miRNAs based on their putative cell-selective expression
patterns. In the CAD group, expression of EC-enriched 
miRNAs (miR-126, miR-17, and miR-92a), VSMC-enriched 
miRNAs (miR-145), and inflammatory cell enriched miRNAs
(miR-155) were all reduced. In contrast, cardiomyocyteenriched
miRNAs (miR-133 and miR-208a) were increased.136
Other groups have identified reduced expression of miRNAs 
(miR-19a, miR-484, miR-155, miR-222, miR-145, miR-29a, 
miR-378, miR-342, miR-181d, miR-150, miR-30e-5p) from 
whole blood of patients with angiographically defined stable 
CAD (at least 1 epicardial vessel with >50% stenosis) compared
with healthy subjects.137 Interestingly, when this cassette
of 11 miRNAs were compared with another group of 
subjects with at least 2 cardiac risk factors, but without angiographically
defined CAD, there were no differences observed, 
suggesting that this cassette of miRNAs may also be associated
with subclinical atherosclerosis.137 Surprisingly, reduced 
expression of 9 miRNAs of this cassette was also associated 
with reduced expression in CAD or at-risk CAD patients taking
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 
receptor blocker antagonists compared with CAD/at-risk 
CAD patients not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
/angiotensin receptor blockers. No associations were 
observed in this same cohort for treatment of statins versus 
no statins. Another study by Zhu et al138 identified miR-155 
expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
or plasma in patients with increasing severity of coronary 
syndrome and found that miR-155 was lower in patients with 
unstable angina (UA) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
than in patients with chest pain syndrome. MiR-155 expression
was further reduced in patients with 2 or 3 diseased vessels
when compared with patients with 0 or 1 diseased vessels. 
However, miR-155 also negatively correlated with a range of 
traditional cardiac risk factors. In addition, D’Alessandra et 
al139 identified increased expression of miR-337-5p, miR-433, 
and miR-485-3p of 178 miRNAs profiled in patients with 
CAD. Specifically, miR-1, miR-122, miR-126, miR-133a/
miR-133b, miR-199a, miR-485-3p, and miR-377-5p were increased
in subjects with stable angina (SA) or UA. Using only 
miR-1, miR-126, and miR-485-3p, this classified correctly 
subjects with SA compared with controls, whereas miR-1, 
miR-126, and miR-133a classified correctly with UA versus 
controls in >87% of cases. However, no combination could 
correctly discriminate between UA and SA, suggesting that 
these markers likely reflect atherosclerotic burden present in 
both UA and SA patients. Moreover, using PBMCs, a higher 
ratio of miR-135a:miR-147 was used to help discriminate patients
with or without CAD.140 In addition, reduced expression 
of miR-181a in PBMCs of obese patients is associated with 
prevalence of CAD.141 In contrast, increased expression of 
miR-146a or miR-146b in patients with CAD was associated 
with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the 
rs2910164 polymorphism in the miR-146a locus is associated 
with an increased risk of CAD in a Chinese Han population.142
Finally, miR-146a expression was significantly increased in 
a Japanese cohort of 66 patients with CAD when compared 
with patients with no CAD. Furthermore, 12 months of statin 
therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or 
angiotensin receptor blocker indicated that miR-146a/b and 
its regulated targets (IRAK, TNF receptor–associated factor 
6, and TLR4) were significantly decreased.143
Unstable Angina
Although the diagnosis of AMI can be facilitated using myocardial
injury biomarkers such as cardiac troponin (cTn) I or 
T, the diagnosis of UA in patients with normal troponin values 
can be elusive. Because UA is associated with a higher risk 
of cardiovascular events, identification of a set of ischemic 
biomarkers may be useful for diagnosis, risk stratification, 
and therapeutic decision-making.144 Only a few miRNAs have 
been uniquely linked to UA when compared with stable CAD. 
However, these findings have not been replicated in larger 
clinical data sets. For example, the expression of miR-134, 
miR-198, and miR-370 from PBMCs was enriched higher in 
25 patients with UA than in 25 with SA. However, these findings
were not verified in a separate cohort of 19 UA and 34

SA patients.139 When the comparator group was noncoronary 
chest pain patients (instead of SA patients), a different cassette 
of miRNAs (miR-132, miR-150, and miR-186) was found to 
be increased in UA patients.145 Collectively, these findings 
suggest that rigorous phenotyping of patients with UA when 
compared with other distinct patient subgroups (eg, AMI, SA, 
and noncoronary chest pain) will be required for appropriate 
discrimination of this unique and important UA group with 
elevated cardiac risk.
Acute Myocardial Infarction
Although cTn is used to assist with the diagnosis of AMI, it 
may serve as a poor discriminator between AMI subtypes.144
In particular, additional biomarkers are desperately needed 
to further define type I MI (ischemic myocardial necrosis
caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture) versus type II 
(ischemic myocardial necrosis not caused by atherosclerotic 
plaque rupture, but typically because of supply/demand mismatch
).144 Emerging studies indicate that different miRNAs 
may be released into the peripheral circulation in response 
to distinct pathophysiological stimuli, suggesting that identification
of a cassette of miRNAs may possess improved 
discriminatory power to diagnose MI subtype or possibly 
lead to an earlier diagnosis. For example, the cardiac-specific
miRNA, miR-208b, is detected in circulation by 3 hours after
AMI and may persist with an elevated expression >90 
days.146,147 Several other groups validated the potential clinical
usefulness of miR-208b as an early biomarker for AMI. 
Interestingly, miR-208 expression levels were increased in 
all (n=33) patients 4 hours post MI when compared with 
85% for cTnI. When compared with other cardiac-enriched 
miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499), the use of miR-
208b conferred more favorable receiver operating characteristic
curve with higher sensitivity and specificity to diagnose 
AMI than noncoronary heart disease patients.148 Similarly, 
miR-208b and miR-499 were significantly increased in AMI 
(n=32) when compared with controls (n=36) that correlated 
with plasma cTnT.149 However, in another study that used a 
larger number of patients with AMI (n=224), the diagnostic 
value for miR-208b (as well as miR-499 and miR-320a) in 
AMI was significantly lower than that of cTnI or cTnT.150
Furthermore, although miR-208b and miR-499 expressions 
were increased higher in patients with ST-segment–elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) than in those with non-STEMI
and correlated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 
(hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in the plasma 
1 hour after onset of chest pain, their diagnostic value was 
comparable with hs-TnT.151 Nonetheless, in a more focused 
patient cohort of non-STEMI geriatric subjects (mean age, 
82.6 years), Olivieri et al152 examined plasma levels of miR-
1, miR-21, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-423-5p, and miR-
499-5p. Remarkably, miR-499-5p was equivalent to cTnT 
in discriminating non-STEMI patients when compared with 
healthy controls or those with acute congestive heart failure. 
Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of miR-499-5p was 
higher than either conventional or high-sensitivity-troponin 
T in discriminating non-STEMI and acute CHF (area under 
the curve, 0.86 for miR-499-5p versus cTnT area under the 
curve, 0.68 or high-sensitivity cTNT area under the curve, 
0.70). Finally, the bicistronic miRNA cluster of miR-1/miR-
133 has also been implicated in AMI,153–155 Despite detection 
of these 4 miRNAs, miR-208b, miR-499-5p, miR-1, and 
miR-133a, in the plasma after AMI, these cardiac-enriched 
miRNAs did not improve diagnostic accuracy of AMI when 
compared with cTnT.156 These findings may reflect the wellestablished
ability of high-sensitivity troponins to be released 
into circulation after generalized myocardial injury.
Atherosclerotic-based biomarkers that may reflect AMI or 
increased predisposition to plaque rupture or erosion would 
help discriminate MI subtype. In keeping with this notion, 
noncardiomyocyte specific miRNAs may provide further 
refinement. For example, increased circulating levels of the 
miR-663 family member, miR-663b (a potential endothelialenriched
and flow-sensitive miRNA implicated in atherosclerosis
[see Mechanosensitive EC miRNAs That Regulate 
Atherosclerosis section of this article] exhibited a high sensitivity
(95%), specificity (90%), and accuracy (92.5%) to discriminate
AMI (n=20 subjects) when compared with controls 
(n=20 subjects).157 Examination of different subtypes of ischemic
injury may also be informative for the use of miRNA 
to assist in diagnostic discrimination of related disease conditions.
For instance, plasma levels of miR-21-5p and miR-361-
5p were significantly increased in patients with AMI (n=17), 
whereas miR-519e-5p was reduced with comparable diagnostic
accuracy to cTnI. In contrast, these 3 miRNAs were all 
increased in patients with ischemic stroke (n=9) or pulmonary 
embolism (n=8), whereas decreased miR-519e-5p was only 
detected in AMI.158 Collectively, these findings indicate that 
miRNAs may be useful to discriminate AMI subtype and raise 
the possibility of incorporating miRNAs as a tool for linking
pathophysiological events, prognosis, and stage-specific 
therapy.159
Taken together, these findings indicate that miRNAs may 
be associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Furthermore, 
caution should be required for interpretation of similar 
miRNA profiling studies based on baseline characteristics of 
medical treatment.
Therapeutic Opportunities and Challenges
Nucleic acid–based therapies represent a new frontier in the 
treatment of human diseases. Several classes of RNA therapeutics
are currently under clinical development, including 
antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA and miRNA mimetics and 
inhibitors. The field of RNA therapeutics saw a huge leap forward
with the recent Food and Drug Administration approval 
of the first antisense oligonucleotide drug, Mipomersen, an 
antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting apoB to treat homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia.160–163 This will likely 
pave the way for other oligonucleotide-based drugs, including 
miRNA replacement and inhibitor therapies. Notably, pharmacological
targeting of miRNAs in disease moves beyond 
the one-drug-one-target mode of treatment offered by siRNAs
, and this has both benefits and drawbacks. The ability
of miRNAs to target gene networks not only provides a 
unique approach for the treatment of disease by modulating 
gene pathways but also opens the door to potential unwanted 
effects on additional target genes. Yet, this type of approach

may prove to be more effective at improving complex diseases 
like atherosclerosis, which involve many pathways and would 
benefit from a multimodal therapeutic.
Antisense oligonucleotides offer the ability to silence 
miRNAs to fine-tune specific pathways or to reduce miRNAs 
expression dysregulated by disease. Several approaches have 
been used to chemically modify anti-miR oligonucleotides to 
enhance target affinity, stability, and tissue uptake.164 These 
include (1) locked nucleic acids which have high binding 
efficiencies and improved stability with the addition of a 
methylene link between the 2′-oxygen and the 4′-carbon resulting
in a locked position and reducing the flexibility of 
the ribose ring,165 (2) ribose 2′-OH group modifications such 
as 2′methoxyethyl and 2′4 ′-constrained 2′O-ethyl, and (3) 
phosphorothioate modification. Careful evaluation of these 
chemical modifications will be required to minimize potential
side effects and unanticipated toxicities. For example, 
phosphorothioate modification may facilitate nucleotidebased
drugs to bind and activate platelets eliciting thrombus 
formation in response to carotid injury, pulmonary thromboembolism
, and mesenteric artery injury in mice.166 Unlike 
their double-stranded counterparts, single-stranded anti-miR 
oligonucleotides can be formulated in saline for subcutaneous 
or intravenous delivery and do not require lipid-based delivery
systems. On systemic delivery, these compounds rapidly 
leave the plasma and are taken up by multiple tissues, most 
prominently liver, spleen, kidney, adipose tissue, and bone 
marrow.167,168 Once taken up by cells, the anti-miR forms a 
stable, high-affinity bond with the miRNA reducing the availability
of the endogenous miRNA for binding to the 3′-UTR 
of the mRNA target. Preclinical studies in nonhuman primates 
using naked anti-miR oligonucleotides have shown promise, 
particularly in targeting miRNA expression in the liver (eg, 
miR-122 and miR-33).13,26 Cholesterol analogs have been 
added to anti-miRs in an attempt increase cellular uptake, and 
this promotes their incorporation into LDL and HDL.169–171
Another approach for miRNA inhibition involves the use of 
miRNA sponges or decoy transcripts,172 which act as competitive
inhibitors of the miRNA of interest. MiRNA sponges 
contain multiple binding sites that are complementary to the 
seed sequence of a miRNA of interest, which mops up the 
miRNA and inhibits its function. MiRNA sponges can be delivered
using viral vectors, and their expression can be made 
to be inducible in a specific cell type or developmental stage 
by using specific promoters. Notably, when vectors containing
miRNA sponges were transfected into cells, miRNA target 
genes were as derepressed as when anti-miR oligonucleotides 
were used.173
MiRNA mimetic therapy using synthetic miRNAs (miRNA
mimics) offers the ability to reconstitute a miRNA that 
is downregulated during disease or to decrease gene pathways
involved in disease pathology. For example, patients 
with CAD exhibit decreased plasma levels of miR-181b, 
which is also expressed in ECs,49 and miRNA mimics could 
be used to restore its expression. The delivery of therapeutic 
miRNA molecules in vivo faces many of the same challenges 
as siRNAs because of their double-stranded nature. Drug delivery
vehicles such as liposomes, polymeric micelles, and 
lipoprotein-based drug carriers are being developed to deliver 
these oligonucleotides to cells. Notably, miRNAs were recently
shown to be associated with endogenous HDL particles 
and to deliver their miRNA cargo to other cells,174 offering the 
potential to use HDL infusion as a miRNA delivery vehicle. 
Some of the current challenges associated with miRNA replacement
technology include the ability to target miRNAs 
to a specific tissue, and the potential requirement of multiple 
doses of a miRNA mimetic to achieve sustained target repression.
Viral vectors can be used as gene delivery carriers for 
miRNAs, including short hairpin RNAs that can be processed 
in the target cell into the mature miRNA, a approach that has 
been used in multiple preclinical studies.17,25,175 However, viral 
delivery systems will require careful scrutiny for clinical use.
Although miRNA mimics and oligonucleotide inhibitors 
are taken up more efficiently in the liver, we and others have 
demonstrated success at penetrating the vascular endothelium 
of the vessel wall and PBMCs.48,49 Because only a minority 
of miRNAs are tissue specific, delivery of miRNA mimics or 
inhibitors in a targeted cell- or tissue-specific rather than a 
systemic manner may represent a novel opportunity to prevent 
the development or progression of atherosclerosis. Recent approaches
to tailor miRNA delivery to specific tissues include 
incorporating target sites for tissue-specific miRNAs, such as 
liver-specific miR-122 and miR-192,176 which would silence 
the vector in the liver, but allow it to be functional in other 
tissues.
Many miRNA-based therapeutics are currently in preclinical
development, and 2 have reached clinical trials. The first is 
a locked nucleic acid directed against miR-122 (Miravirsen), 
which targets hepatitis C virus RNA.177 Studies in nonhuman 
primates showed that miR-122 inhibition resulted in longlasting
suppression of hepatitis C virus viremia with no evidence
of viral resistance or side effects.178 In a human phase 
2 study, Miravirsen demonstrated dose-dependent antiviral 
activity when given as a 4-week monotherapy that was maintained
for >4 weeks after the end of therapy.179 Notably, hepatitis
C virus RNAs in 4 of 9 patients treated with the highest 
doses of Miravirsen became undetectable during the study,180
demonstrating the potential of anti-miR therapeutics. The second
miRNA therapeutic in clinical trial is a double-stranded 
miRNA mimic of miR-34, which acts as a tumor suppressor 
by inhibiting multiple oncogenic pathways and stimulating 
antitumor immune responses.181 MRX34 is a miR-34 mimic 
encapsulated in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation that is 
being tested in patients in a range of advanced solid tumors 
and hematologic malignancies. The results of these first clinical
trials of a miRNA mimic and inhibitor are eagerly awaited.
During the past several decades, significant progress 
has been achieved to treat atherosclerosis. Most notably, 
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
(statins) have been widely used to treat patients in the 
primary and secondary prevention of CAD. Although statins 
effectively reduce LDL levels and cardiovascular events, a 
considerable residual burden of CAD remains even in patients 
treated with statins. Novel complementary therapeutic approaches
will likely be necessary for treating disease states 
such as atherosclerosis involving complex signaling networks.

In this regard, because miRNAs target multiple genes often in 
the same regulatory network, miRNAs may have tremendous 
effects on biological pathways, cell function, and homeostasis 
in the vessel wall, liver, and periphery. Delivery of a cassette 
of miRNA mimics or inhibitors may thereby offer an attractive
therapeutic approach to facilitate fine-tuning specific 
stages of atherosclerotic disease and in the management of its 
complications.
