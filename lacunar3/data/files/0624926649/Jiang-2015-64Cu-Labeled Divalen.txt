The rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques that lead to stroke

this study, an engineered integrin α

–targeting PET probe, 64Cu-
NOTA-3-4A, derived from a divalent knottin miniprotein was evaluated
in a mouse model for carotid atherosclerotic plaques.Methods:
Atherosclerotic plaques in BALB/C mice, maintained on a high-fat
diet, were induced with streptozotocin injection and carotid artery
ligation and verified by MR imaging. Knottin 3-4A was synthesized
by solid-phase peptide synthesis chemistry and coupled to 1,4,7-
triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) before radiolabeling
with 64Cu. PET probe stability in mouse serum was evaluated.
Mice with carotid atherosclerotic plaques were injected via the tail
vein with 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A or 18F-FDG, followed by small-animal PET/
CT imaging at different time points. Receptor targeting specificity
of the probe was verified by coinjection of c(RGDyK) administered
in molar excess. Subsequently, carotid artery dissection and immunofluorescence
staining were performed to evaluate target
expression. Results: 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A was synthesized in high radiochemical
purity and yield and demonstrated molecular stability in
both phosphate-buffered saline and mouse serum at 4 h. Smallanimal
PET/CT showed that 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A accumulated at significantly
higher levels in the neovasculature of carotid atherosclerotic
plaques (7.41 ± 1.44 vs. 0.67± 0.23 percentage injected dose/gram,
P, 0.05) than healthy or normal vessels at 1 h after injection. 18FFDG
also accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions at 0.5 and 1 h after
injection but at lower plaque–to–normal tissue ratios than 64Cu-
NOTA-3-4A. For example, plaque–to–normal carotid artery ratios
for 18F-FDG and 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A at 1 h after injection were 3.75
and 14.71 (P , 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, uptake of 64Cu-
NOTA-3-4A in atherosclerotic plaques was effectively blocked
(∼90% at 1 h after injection) by coinjection of c(RGDyK). Immunostaining
confirmed integrin α
v
β

expression in both the infiltrating
macrophages and the neovasculature of atherosclerotic plaques.
Conclusion: 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A demonstrates specific accumulation
in carotid atherosclerotic plaques in which macrophage infiltration
and angiogenesis are responsible for elevated integrinα
v
β

levels. Therefore, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A may demonstrate clinical utility
as a PET probe for atherosclerosis imaging or for the evaluation of
therapies used to treat atherosclerosis.

ardiovascular disease induced by atherosclerosis is a leading
cause of death in the Western world. Most myocardial infarctions
and sudden cardiac deaths result from the rupture of vulnerable
atherosclerotic plaques (1–4). Therefore, tools that detect atherosclerotic
plaques are needed in the clinic. At present, several imaging
modalities are used to identify atherosclerotic lesions in patients,
including CT angiography, MR imaging, and intravascular ultrasound.
Although these imaging modalities have been able to delineate
certain features of plaques, their sensitivity and specificity are
relatively low (5,6). On the other hand, nuclear imaging techniques
such as PET may provide a more sensitive and quantitative route to
determine the extent of cardiovascular disease (7).
Inflammation is a well-studied feature of atherosclerotic plaques
that are at high risk of rupture (1,2). Therefore, molecular imaging of
inflammation-associated markers may be a promising tool to quantify
rupture risk of plaques and warn against further adverse cardiovascular
events. The most widely studied PET probe for detection of
plaque-based inflammation is 18F-FDG (8,9), which is taken up by
active macrophages so that it provides information about the extent
of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques (10–12). However, 18FFDG
is a nonspecific imaging probe for inflammation, because it can
also accumulate in calcified structures of vessel walls, muscle tissues
adjacent to the vessels, and tissues with high metabolic rates such as
the myocardium and brain. Therefore, new PET probes to image
plaque-related inflammation and their propensity to rupture are
needed in treating heart disease (13).
Recently, integrin a
v
b
3
expression in atherosclerosis has been
reported to be a promising marker of vulnerable plaques (14–16).
Integrin a
v
b
3
receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins, which
are highly expressed by not only activated endothelial cells of new
vessels in the atherosclerotic plaques, but also activated macrophages
that mediate the inflammatory process. Therefore, radiolabeled
peptides such as Arg-Gly-Aspartic acid (RGD) peptide
that specifically bind to a
v
b
3
integrin have been studied by PET
imaging of atherosclerotic plaques (13,17–20). For example, 18F-
galacto-RGD (13) and 68Ga-DOTA-RGD (17) have shown specific
targeting to integrina
v

. However, their accumulation in atherosclerotic
lesions and their plaque–to–normal tissue ratios are low

in preclinical models. The uptake of 18F-galacto-RGD by the aorta
plaque was only 0.24 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g)
at 2 h after injection, and the aorta–to–normal vessel wall uptake
ratio was 1.3 (13). The aorta plaque uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-RGD
was 0.90 %ID/g at 1 h after injection, and aorta-to-heart and aortato-blood
uptake ratios were 1.8 and 1.1 at 1 h after injection,
respectively (17). Therefore, PET probes with higher integrin

receptor binding affinity and specificity are needed to be
of any clinical utility in management of cardiovascular disease.
Cystine knot peptides, also known as knottins, are small polypeptides
that are characterized by a stable core motif formed by
multiple disulfide bonds (3 or 4) that are interwoven into a knotted
conformation, which endows these peptides with high thermal and
proteolytic stability. They are relatively small (30–50 amino acids) and
often made by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl ([Fmoc] or t-butyloxy carbonyl
) solid-phase peptide synthesis. Importantly, knottins demonstrate
fast blood clearance, high and specific integrin a

ability, and biocompatibility. Together, these biologic, chemical, and
physical properties bode well for clinical imaging applications. In our

associated with carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General and Animal Model
All Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem/
EMD Chemicals Inc. or CS Bio. c(RGDyK) peptide was purchased
from Peptides International. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M,
pH 7.4) was obtained from Gibco/Invitrogen. All other chemicals were
purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise specified.
Male BALB/C mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory.
As shown in Figure 1A, carotid atherosclerotic plaques were induced in
male BALB/C mice by the following protocol. Mice (n5 20) were fed
with a high-fat diet containing 40% kcal fat, 1.25% (by weight) cholesterol
, and 0.5% (by weight) sodium cholate (D12109; Research
Diets, Inc.). After 4 wk of high-fat diet, mice were rendered diabetic
by administration of 7 daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin
(40 mg/kg in citrate buffers [0.05 mol/L, pH 4.5, Sigma Aldrich]). At
day 7 of the streptozotocin injections, serum glucose level was measured
by sampling tail vein blood and using a glucometer. If the glucose
level was below 200 mg/L, animals were injected with additional streptozotocin
for 3 consecutive days. At day 14 after initiation of streptozotocin
injection, the left common carotid artery was ligated below the
bifurcation with 6-0 silk ligature (Ethicon) under 2% inhaled isoflurane.
In sham-operated animals, the suture was put around the exposed left
carotid artery but not tightened. The wound was closed by suture, and
the mice were allowed to recover on a warming blanket. All procedures
were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care
at Stanford University.
Small-Animal MR Imaging
Mice (n5 20) from the treatment described above were sequentially
anesthetized using 2% isoflurane and placed supine in a specially
designed stage with the top of their necks centered in a small, circular
MR imaging coil. The small-animal MR imaging scanner consisted of
a superconducting magnet (Magnex Scientific) with 7.0-T field strength,
a gradient (Resonance Research, Inc.) with a clear bore size of 9 cm, a
maximum gradient amplitude of 770 mT/m and a maximum slew rate
of 2,500 T/m/s, and a console and Copley 266 amplifiers (GE Healthcare
). A 15-s localizer scan was conducted first, followed by a prescan
to allow for manual gradient shimming. Then, a T1-weighted fast spin
echo sequence was obtained from the bottom of the head to the top of
the chest. No contrast agents were given. This scan was approximately
5 min long for 30 slices and had an isotropic resolution of 20 mm. The
mouse was then removed from the scanner and allowed to recover in its
cage. The small-animal MR imaging data were analyzed using the
commercially available DICOM image viewer OsiriX (http://www.
osirix-viewer.com/).
Peptide Synthesis and Folding, NOTA Conjugation, and
64Cu Labeling
The linear knottin 3-4A was synthesized with a CS BioCS336
instrument using Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis, and the
crude peptide was deprotected and cleaved from resin as reported
previously (25). Linear 3-4A peptide was oxidized and folded in 4 M
guanidinium chloride, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 2 mM oxidized
glutathione, and 3.5% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide at pH 8.0 in ammonium
bicarbonate buffer at room temperature for 1 d with gentle mixing.
Folded peptide was purified on a Vydac C18 preparatory scale column
and lyophilized. Purified peptide was dissolved in water, and concentration
was determined by amino acid analysis (AAA Service Laboratory
). Similarly, peptide purity and molecular mass were determined by
analytic-scale reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), respectively.
NOTA, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, and
N-hydroxysulfono-succinimide at a molar ratio of 1:1:0.8 were mixed in
water and incubated at 4C for 30 min (pH 5.5). 3-4Awas then added to
the in situ–prepared sulfosuccinimidyl ester of NOTA in a theoretic
stoichiometry of 1:5 in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5–9.0). The
solution was reacted at 4C overnight, and the resulting NOTA-3-4
conjugate was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by
MALDI-TOF-MS as described above. NOTA-3-4A (25mg) was radiolabeled
with 64Cu by the addition of 74–111 MBq (2–3 mCi) of 64CuCl
2
(University of Wisconsin) in 0.1N sodium acetate (pH 5.5), followed by
1-h incubation at 37C. The radiolabeled complex was purified by
a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and eluted with PBS.
In Vitro Stability
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A (1.85–3.7 MBq [50–100mCi]) was incubated in
0.5 mL of mouse serum for 4 h at 37C. The mixture was then treated

with 0.5 mL of acetonitrile to precipitate the serum protein and centrifuged
at 16,000g for 2 min. The supernatant containing greater than
95% of the radioactivity was filtered using a 0.22-mm nylon SpinX
column (Corning Inc.). Greater than 99% of the radioactivity passed
through this filter. In addition, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A (1.85–3.7 MBq [50–
100mCi]) was also incubated in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. The
samples were analyzed by radio-HPLC, and the percentage of intact
peptide was determined by quantifying peaks corresponding to the
intact peptide and degradation products.
Small-Animal PET/CT
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A. PET/CT imaging of BALB/C mice with carotid
atherosclerotic plaques was performed using a small-animal PET/CT
scanner (Inveon; Siemens). Mice (n5 4 for each group) were injected
via the tail vein with approximately 3.7–5.55 MBq (100–150 mCi) of
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A. At 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after injection, mice were anesthetized
for imaging experiments. On the second day, the same mice
were injected through the tail vein with 2.96–3.7 MBq (80–100mCi) of
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A with or without approximately 330mg of c(RGDyK)
as blocking agent. At 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after injection, mice were keeping
space consistent throughout (5% isoflurane for induction and 2% for
maintenance in 100% O
2
) for the imaging experiment.
The images were reconstructed with a 2-dimensional ordered-subset
expectation maximization algorithm with CT-based attenuation correction.
Image files were analyzed using the vendor-supplied software
Inveon Research Workspace (Preclinical Solutions; Siemens Healthcare
Molecular Imaging). For each small-animal PET scan, 3-dimensional
regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the organs and tissues on
decay-corrected whole-body images. The average radioactivity concentration
in the ROI was obtained from the mean pixel values within the
ROI volume. These data were converted to counts per milliliter
per minute using a predetermined conversion factor. The results were
divided by the injected dose to obtain an image ROI–derived %ID/g of
tissue (29).
18F-FDG. Similar to the 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A PET/CT scan, mice
models (n5 4) were also injected via the tail vein with approximately
3.7–5.55 MBq (100–150 mCi) of 18F-FDG. At 0.5 and 1 h after injection
, mice were anesthetized for imaging experiments.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Air-dried frozen slides (10-mm thickness) of carotid tissues were
fixed in ice-cold acetone and blocked by incubation with 1% PBS/
bovine serum albumin for 30 min to prevent unspecific binding. Immunofluorescence
staining was performed using antiintegrin a
v

3
(CD511CD61) polyclonal antibody (Bioss) for a
v
b
3
integrin with
anti-CD68 antibody (Abcam) for macrophages and with anti-CD31
antibody (Abcam) for endothelial cells, respectively. Finally, sections
were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for visualization
of cell nuclei. The slides were observed under a microscope
(Axiovert 200 M), and images were acquired under the same conditions
and displayed at the same scale for comparison.
Statistical Analysis
The quantitative data were expressed as mean6 SD. Means were
compared using the Student t test. A 95% confidence level was chosen
to determine the significance between groups, with P values of less
than 0.05 indicating significant differences.
RESULTS
Establishment of Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaques
MR imaging was used to evaluate whether the carotid atherosclerotic
plaques were successfully established in mouse models
subjected to PET imaging protocols. Compared with the normal
contralateral carotid artery, MR imaging revealed stenosis within
the affected artery as shown on an axial MR image (Fig. 1B).
Moreover, a longitudinal plane of the 3-dimensional fast low-angle
shot MR images shows that blood flow in the affected (left) artery
was significantly decreased, compared with the normal (right) carotid
artery (Fig. 1C). After acquisition of MR imaging and PET
data, mice were euthanized so that the injured artery could be
examined by bright-field magnification. These anatomic images
clearly show the damaged vessel wall (solid white structure) of
the left artery (Fig. 1D).
Preparation of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A
Linear 3-4A was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis,
folded in an oxidative buffer, purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and
characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS (sequence and schematic structure
are shown in Fig. 2). Folded peptide 3-4A recorded an m/z value of
3,940.2, which corresponded to the [M1H]1
(calculated m/z5 3,938.6). The knottin peptide
3-4A was then site-specifically conjugated
to NOTA through its N-terminal amino
group using an N-hydroxysuccimide ester
NOTA derivative. The resulting NOTA-3-4A
showed an m/z of 4,225.2 for [MH]1 (calculated
m/z5 4,226.0). The NOTA-3-4A peptide
was then radiolabeled with 64Cu. The
radiochemical yield of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A
peptide was greater than 70%, and radiochemical
purity was greater than 95% as

analyzed by radio-HPLC. A modest specific activity of 4.3 MBq/nmol
of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A was obtained at the end of synthesis (decaycorrected
). The stability of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A was further evaluated
in PBS and mouse serum. As shown by the radio-HPLC
analysis, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A was highly stable, and there was no
degradation observed in PBS or 4-h incubation in mouse serum at
37C (Fig. 3).
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A PET/CT Imaging Study
The atherosclerotic lesion in the left carotid artery was clearly
visible at 1 h (Fig. 4A) after injection and demonstrated high
contrast with low contralateral background, which persisted from
1 to 4 h after injection (Fig. 4B). PET/CT imaging also showed
relatively high kidney signal at all the imaging time points, indicating
the renal clearance of the probe. Meanwhile, most of the
normal organs demonstrated relatively low signal. Further smallanimal
PET quantification analysis showed that the atherosclerotic
plaque uptake was 7.41 6 1.44 %ID/g at 1 h after injection,
whereas normal tissues such as the common contralateral artery,
brain, heart, liver, and muscle exhibited much lower uptake than
the atherosclerotic lesion (Fig. 4C). Because of the renal clearance
of the PET probe, high accumulation of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A in the
kidneys was observed from 1 to 4 h, which decreased to 4.636
0.54 %ID/g at 24 h after injection. Importantly, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A
displayed high plaque–to–background tissue (common artery,
brain, heart, muscle) ratios (Fig. 4D). For example, at 1 h after
injection, the plaque–to–common artery, plaque-to-brain, plaqueto-heart
, and plaque-to-muscle ratios of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A were
17.47 6 3.50, 27.76 6 4.31, 21.31 6 3.69, and 42.99 6 5.48,
respectively. Moreover, the a
v
b
3
integrin–targeting specificity of
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A was evaluated by the coinjection of a large
amount of c(RGDyK). Significantly reduced uptake of 64Cu-
NOTA-3-4A by the left carotid atherosclerotic lesion was observed
on PET images from 1 to 24 h after injection (Fig. 4B).
Comparative 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging Study
The atherosclerotic lesion in the left carotid artery was visible at
0.5 h after injection and demonstrated high contrast with low
contralateral background from 0.5 to 1 h after injection (supplemental
materials [available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org]). 18FFDG
exhibited relatively high kidney uptake. Interestingly, despite
fasting and consistent experimental protocols for all mice, the myocardial
and brain uptake of 18F-FDG were extremely variable.
Quantification analysis showed that the accumulation of 18F-FDG
in the left atherosclerotic plaques was much higher than the common
right carotid artery (10.4760.60 vs. 2.7960.40 %ID/g at 0.5 h
after injection and 10.666 1.24 %ID/g vs. 1.916 0.45 %ID/g at
1 h after injection). The myocardial uptake of 18F-FDG ranged
from 3.65 to 26.08 %ID/g, and the brain uptake was from 4.13 to
32.45 %ID/g 0.5 h after injection. The kidney uptake of 18F-FDG
was found to be 10.026 1.67 %ID/g at 0.5 h after injection and
22.8864.67 %ID/g at 1 h after injection, respectively. The plaque–
to–common artery and plaque-to-muscle ratios of 18F-FDG at 1 h
were 5.566 1.05 and 58.676 3.69, respectively.
Immunofluorescence Staining
To determine whether a
v
b
3
integrin expression in the carotid
atherosclerotic plaques was associated with macrophage infiltration
and or angiogenesis, immunohistochemical staining was performed.
CD68 and CD31 staining confirmed the presence of both macrophages
and angiogenesis in atherosclerotic plaques, respectively.
Moreover, CD51 and CD61 staining identified the expression integrina
v

in carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The results revealed the
distinct colocalization of integrina
v

markers with CD68-positive
macrophages (Fig. 5A) and a

integrin with vessel endothelial
cells (Fig. 5B).
DISCUSSION
In the clinic, 18F-FDG PET has been used to detect inflammation
in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and to select patients for vascular
surgery (12). However, the lack of specificity hampers the
clinical utility of 18F-FDG for cardiovascular disease. Integrin

expressed by both plaque-associated macrophages and activated
endothelial cells, which form plaque neovasculature. Imaging integrina

expression could therefore be a usefully noninvasive tool to
predict the unstable plaques.
Radiolabeled RGD peptides are of particular interest because
they specifically bind integrin a

. 18F-galacto-RGD was developed
to detect atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta of hypercholesterolemic
mice (13). Although the %ID/g in the aorta was more
than 2 times higher than the residual activity in the blood of the
same mice, the uptake of 18F-galacto-RGD in the aorta was only
0.246 0.07 %ID/g at 2 h after injection, and the aorta–to–normal
vessel wall ratio was 1.3. Further evaluation of 18F-galacto-RGD
in human carotid plaques revealed a positive correlation between
18F-galacto-RGD uptake and a
v
b
3
expression of carotid plaques
(7). Moreover, 68Ga-DOTA-RGD was also evaluated in the aorta
of hypercholesterolemic mice and showed aorta uptake of 0.906
0.21 %ID/g at 1 h after injection, and the aorta-to-heart and aortato-blood
uptake ratios were 1.8 and 1.1 at 1 h after injection,
respectively (17). 18F-flotegatide was also reported in a mouse
model of aortic plaques. It showed aorta uptake 2.86 0.4 %ID/g
at 1 h after injection, and the aorta-to-heart ratio and aorta-tomuscle
ratio were 14 and 18, respectively (18).
For the current study, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report to describe the PET-labeled knottin for imaging carotid
atherosclerotic lesions. Several cystine-knot peptides, including
Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor (EETI-II) (21) and Agoutirelated
protein (30), have been used as scaffolds to engineer peptides
that bind integrin receptors with low nanomolar affinities.
EETI-II and Agouti-related protein–based cystine peptides are
small (3–4 kDa); are amenable to amino acid substitutions; and have
high chemical, thermal, and proteolytic stability. In our previous
studies, divalent knottin 3-4A was successfully radiolabeled with
64Cu (25)and18F( 31) for imaging integrin a
v
b
3
-positive U87MG
tumor in living animals. In this study, PET/CT imaging and quantification
results demonstrated the atherosclerotic lesion in the left
carotid artery to be clearly visible at 1 h after injection. Compared
with the uninjured contralateral common carotid artery (0.67 6
0.23 %ID/g at 1 h after injection), the uptake of the left carotid
atherosclerotic lesion was 7.416 1.44 %ID/g, which was significantly
higher than uptake values of 18F-galacto-RGD, 68Ga-DOTARGD
, and 18F-flotegatide (P, 0.05). Plaque–to–background tissue
ratios, especially the plaque-to-heart ratio, are clinically important
because of the potentially debilitating effects of myocardial infarctions.
Compared with the previously reported RGD-based PET
probes, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A also displayed much higher plaque-toheart
ratio (27.8 at 1 h after injection). Considering there is no huge
difference for the a
v
b
3
in vitro affinity of the 18F-galacto-RGD,
DOTA-RGD, and DOTA-3-4A (5, 3.2, and 8 nM, respectively)
(13,17,25), the different imaging results among these probes are
likely caused by their different in vivo pharmacokinetic properties
of the probes.
Comparisons to 18F-FDG PET are also presented here. The
atherosclerotic lesion in the left carotid artery was readily visible
at 0.5 h after injection of 18F-FDG. Although the accumulation of
18F-FDG by plaques was higher than that of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A at
1 h after injection (10.66 6 1.24 vs. 7.41 6 1.44 %ID/g, P ,
0.05), the plaque–to–common carotid artery ratio of 18F-FDG was
significantly lower than that of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A at 1 h after injection
(3.75 vs. 14.71, P , 0.05). The normal myocardial and
brain uptake of 18F-FDG in mice was extremely variable, and the
ratios of plaque-to-brain and plaque-to-heart were difficult to be
exactly evaluated. Thus, 18F-FDG imaging of atherosclerotic plaques
in brain and heart arteries may be of limited clinical utility.
Compared with 18F-FDG, 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A did not accumulate in
normal myocardium and brain, which could be beneficial for imaging
coronary and brain vessels. In addition, successful use of
64Cu-DOTATATE in human neuroendocrine tumors highlights the
promise of 64Cu-based probes in clinical settings (32). Similarly,
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A may potentially be used to image a variety of
integrin a
v
b
3
–positive lesions in human subjects. A variety of
engineered cystine-knot peptides coupled to different PET labels
are undergoing extensive testing and validation (22,26,31).
Finally, the immunofluorescent staining displayed a correlation
between integrin a
v
b
3
expression and macrophage infiltration as
well as formation of the neovasculature. These data indicate that
the uptake mechanism of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A by atherosclerotic
plaques is through binding to integrin a
v
b
3
expressed on the surface
of macrophages and endothelial cells.
CONCLUSION
64Cu-NOTA-3-4A displayed significantly high and specific accumulation
in carotid atherosclerotic plaques, which correlated by
immunofluorescence staining to overexpression of a
v
b
3
integrin
by both macrophages and angiogenic endothelial cells. Moreover,
lower normal-tissue uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A and a high plaque–
to–normal tissue ratios were observed. Collectively, these results
suggest that 64Cu-NOTA-3-4A may be a promising PET probe for
clinical imaging of carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
