Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the
life-threatening diseases with high morbidity and mortality
rates. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific proteases
3 (SENP3), a member of the SUMO-specific protease
family, was identified as an isopeptidase that
deconjugates SUMOylation (The covalent modification by
SUMO) of modified protein substrates. It is reported that
SUMO-2/3 conjugation, a member of SUMOylation, presented
neuroprotection. The study aimed to evaluate the
expression of SENP3 and to explore its role potential role
in SAH. A total of 95 Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly
divided into sham group and SAH groups at 6, 12, 24, 48 h,
day 3, day 5, and day 7. SAH groups suffered experimental
SAH by injection with 0.3 ml nonheparinized autoblood
into the prechiasmatic cistern. SENP3 expression is surveyed
by western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain
reaction, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.
The levels of cleavage caspase-3 were determined by
western blot and immunohistochemistry. SENP3 protein
expression was significantly up-regulated after SAH which
peaked at 24 h; however, the mRNA expression of SENP3
remained unchanged. Meanwhile, the level of cleaved
caspase-3 was also increased after SAH. There is a highly
positive correlation between cleavage caspase-3 and
SENP3 in protein level. Immunofluorescent results showed
that the expression of SENP3 was increased in neurons,
rather than astrocytes nor microglia. Our findings indicated
a possible role of SENP3 in the pathogenesis of early brain
injury mediated by apoptosis following SAH.

cerebral vasospasm (CVS) was regarded as a unique and
paramount factor of poor outcome following SAH for
several decades, current series of studies and largish
reviews illustrate that early brain injury (EBI) is another
factor influencing outcome. Therefore, more and more
researches convert from CVS to EBI (Sehba and Pluta
2011). The EBI was considered widely to be the injury
occurred in 72 h after SAH.
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is covalently
linked to a variety of proteins and is deconjugated by
SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (Hay 2005). It modifies
protein at post-translation and functions in various
kinds of cell signaling pathways (Yeh and Gong 2000).
SENPs are an isopeptidase in guaranteeing SUMO
homeostasis between modified protein substrates (SUMOylation
) and not modified protein substrates (deSUMOylation
) (Sun et al. 2013; Yeh 2009). This balance
influences differentiation, growth, targeting, and communication
between cells which are highly complex and
tightly regulated (Wilkinson and Nakamura 2010). For
example, disrupting it contributed to cancer development
and progression (Han et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2013). And it
is also important in the central nervous system (CNS).
General increase of SUMO-2/3 conjugation is a neuroprotective
response to severe stress (Guo et al. 2013).
Extra SENP3 could reverse this neuroprotection in a
ischemia model (Yeh 2009). SNEP3 is prevented from
proteasomal degradation-related ubiquitin when calculated
ROS stimulate cells (Yan et al. 2010).
Few studies examining SENP3 in the CNS indicated that
this enzyme is related to apoptosis, which is one of the
most important mechanisms of EBI following SAH (Cahill
2006). In a vitro model of ischemia, declined SENP3 leaded
to a suppression of caspase-mediated neuronal apoptosis
(Guo et al. 2013). In spinal cord injury (SCI) model,
SENP3 was up-regulation that Implicating for neuronal
apoptosis (Wei et al. 2012). However, there are no studies
concentrating on expression of SENP3 in brain tissue after
SAH. In order to acquire more knowledge of SENP3 after
SAH and coming up with any possibility of a relationship
between SENP3 and apoptosis in SAH rats, this study was
designed to identify the time course of SENP3 expression
in cerebral cortex and to clarify the correlation between
SENP3 and apoptosis in early brain injury following SAH.
Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–320 g) were acquired
from Animal Center of Jinling Hospital. The rats were
raised on a 12-h dark–light cycle circumstance. They were
given free access to food and water. All procedures were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Nanjing University and accorded to Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals by National Institutes of
Health.
Animal Model of SAH
The prechiasmatic injection model was used to imitate
SAH (Jeon et al. 2010). Specifically, after intraperitoneal
anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA), they were located prone in a stereotactic
frame. After careful disinfection treatment, a
midline scalp incision was taken and a 1-mm hole was
drilled at 7.5 mm anterior to the bregma in the midline, at
an angle of 30E caudally. Then they were turned into
supine position. Carefully disinfecting again, then we use
insulin injection needle (BD Science) to obtain 300 ll of 
their own blood from femoral artery. The needle (BD
Science) was advanced 11 mm into the prechiasmatic cistern
through this hole, and the blood was injected into the
prechiasmatic cistern over 20 s. Sham animals were operated
the same surgery process but not injection with blood
into the prechiasmatic cistern. After finishing these procedures
, 1 ml of 0.9 % NaCl solution was injected subcutaneously
to prevent dehydration. And the rats were
returned to their cages. Rats with SAH were randomly
divided into seven sub-groups and killed by ventricle perfusion
at 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and on day 3, day 5, day 7 post-
SAH (n = 6/subgroup). Another 18 rats were chosen randomly
for immunohistochemical (IHC) study of sham
group, 24 and 72 h group (n = 6/subgroup). Our study
found that there was no statistical difference of all items
detected among sham groups at each time point. Therefore,
sham group animals were killed at 24 h after sham
operation.
Perfusion-Fixation and Tissue Preparation
The rats were anesthetized as above, and perfused through
the left cardiac ventricle with 0.9 % NaCl solutions until
the effluent from the right atrium was clear. Animals which
had obvious clots in the prechiasmatic cistern were selected
for further analysis. Then blood clots on the brain tissue
were cleared, the temporal lobe tissue (Fig. 1) near the
hematoma was obtained on ice and stored in -80 C for
western blot and realtime-PCR analysis. For immunohistochemistry
and immunofluorescence study, the rats were
perfused with 0.9 % NaCl solutions, then perfused 4 %
buffered paraformaldehyde; the brain was immersed in
4 % buffered paraformaldehyde 8 h then embedded in
paraffin for immunohistochemistry study and frozen in
OCT for immunofluorescence study.

Western Blot Analysis
Completely homogenizing and centrifuging (at 14,000g for
15 min at 4 C) of just enough brain tissues were prepared
for western blot analysis. Sequently, the supernate was
collected. The samples were added SDS sample buffer,
followed by boiling for 5 min at 100 C. Samples (10 ll/
lane) were separated by electrophoresis on 10 % SDS-
polyacrylamide gels for 30 min at 80 V, then shift to
100 min at 110 V. When electrophoresis was done, it was
transferred onto PVDF for 2 h at 200 mA. The membrane
was blocked with 5 % defatted milk for 2 h at room temperature
, after that incubated with anti-SENP3 antibody
(diluted 1:1,000 in 5 % defatted milk, Cell Signaling
Technology), active caspase-3 (anti-rabbit, 1:500; Cell
Signaling, #9664), and b-actin (diluted 1:5,000 in 5 %
defatted milk, Bioworld, USA) at 4 C with mild shaking
for 8 h. Following washing for 10 min each for four times
in TBS ? Tween 20 (TBST), the membrane was incubated
in the appropriate secondary antibody (diluted 1:5,000 in
TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The chemiluminescence
(ECL, Thermo Scientific, USA) visualizes the blotted
bands. And the bands were exposed to X-ray
photographic film. Relative changes in protein expression
were evaluated from the mean pixel density by using UNSCAN-IT
, compared with b-actin, and calculated as target
protein expression/b-actin expression ratios.
RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Rat cerebral tissues were isolated by TRIzol Reagent
(TAKARA Biotechnology). The concentration of the RNA
was confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis (OD260/
280). The quantity of RNA was measured by OD260. The
isolated RNA was stored at -80 C until it being analyzed.
RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by Reverse
Transcriptase Reagent (TAKARA Biotechnology) and
oligo dT primers. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was
conducted by the Agilent Technologies Strata gene
Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Gene times Technology,
Inc.) and real-time SYBRGreen PCR technology. A reaction
unit contained 1 ll of each forward and reverse primer
(10 lM), 1 ll cDNA, 12.5 ll SYBRGreen (TAKARA
Biotechnology), and nuclease-free water to a final 25 ll.
And the primers were synthesized by Life Technologies
(Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). The sequences applied were
from the database at NCBI for rat SENP3 and b-actin.
SENP3 forward and reverse primers were 50-GGG
CTTCCGGGTATCCTA-30 and 50-TGCGTCGCCTTA
CATCAA-30; b-actin forward and reverse primers were
50-AGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-30 and 50-CGCTCATTG
CCGATAGTG-30. After 95 C for 30 s, 40 PCR cycles
were performed, each cycle including a denaturation step
(95 C, 5 s) and an annealing step (60 C, 30 s). Total
RNA concentrations from each sample were normalized by
quantity of b-actin messenger RNA (mRNA), and the
expression levels of target genes were calculated by the 2-
DDCq method. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
Immunohistochemical Staining
The tissue was fixed with the 4 % paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin. IHC staining was performed as our
previous study (Bawa-Khalfe 2010). Detailedly, the tissue
sections (4 lm) were used for IHC staining; the sections
were deparaffinized as usual and incubated with 3 % H

in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. Sections
were blocked with 5 % normal fetal bovine serum in PBS
for 2 h followed by incubation with anti-SENP3 antibody
(diluted 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology) and active
caspase-3 (anti-rabbit, 1:100; Cell Signaling, #9664),
respectively. After washing carefully for half an hour, each
of the sections was incubated with horse radish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for
60 min at room temperature. After washing for half an hour
again, diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen and
counter staining was done with hematoxylin. The negative
control was also performed without adding SENP3 antibody
and active caspase-3 antibody, respectively. Meanwhile
, the other steps were the same between the
experiment sections and negative control. In detail, three
coronary sections of temporal lobe tissue in each rat brain
sample, with a minimum of 150 lm from the adjoining
section, were used for cell counting in each sample. Six
randomly non-overlapping high power areas (9400) per
section were selected and observed. Then mean percentage
of robust SENP3-positive cells in the six views was
regarded as the data for each section. The final average
percentage of the three sections was regarded as the data
for the sample. Six samples in each group were employed
for the statistical analysis. The percentage of robust
SENP3-positive cells was identified, calculated, and analyzed
under a light microscope by an investigator blinded
to the grouping. Robust expression of SENP3 cells was
defined as presenting dark buffy grains in cells shown by
arrows in Fig. 5. The robust SENP3-positive expression
percentage was defined as which the number of robust
SENP3-positive cells accounted for in total number of
SENP3-positive cells of each visual field.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to
our previous study in our laboratory (Li et al. 2013). Brain
tissue was fixed with 4 % araformaldehyde overnight and
dipped in 20 % saccharose PBS for 2 days and then in
30 % saccharose PBS for another 2 days to remove water
in the tissue. Sections 6 lm in thickness were sliced and
blocked with 5 % normal fetal bovine serum in PBS containing
0.1 % Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature
prior to incubation with anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein
(NeuN) antibody (Millipore, USA, 1:200) and anti-
SENP3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology 1:100) or
anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)
antibody (abcam, 1:200) and anti-SENP antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology 1:100) or anti-glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) antibody (Millipore, USA, 1:200) and anti-
SENP3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology 1:100) over
night at 4 C. After sections were washed three times with
PBS for 45 min, they were incubated with proper secondary
antibodies (AlexaFluor488 and AlexaFluor594, 1:200)
for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed with
PBS again three times for 45 min prior to be counter
stained by DAPI for 2 min. After three washes again, the
slides were covered by microscopic glass with anti-fade
mounting medium for further study. Negative controls
were prepared by omitting the primary antibodies. Fluorescence
microscopy imaging was performed using ZEISS
HB050 inverted microscope system and handled by Image-
Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, USA) and
Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, USA).
In the merged photomicrographs, yellow color indicates
co-localization-positive expression. And the co-localization-positive
expression proportion was defined as which
the number of co-localization-positive expression accounted
for in total number of SENP3-positive expression of
each type-specific marker group. Six randomly non-overlapping
high power areas (9400) per section were selected
and observed. Then mean percentage of co-localization
cells in the six views was regarded as the data for each
section. The final average percentage of the three sections
was regarded as the data for the sample. Six samples in
each group were employed for the statistical analysis. The
co-localization-positive expression proportion was identified
, calculated, and analyzed under a light microscope by
an investigator blinded to the grouping.
Statistical Analysis
All data were presented as mean ± SE. SPSS 21.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago) was applied for statistical analysis of the
data. The measurements were analyzed to ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s post-hoc test. The relationship between
SENP3 protein and cleaved caspase-3 expression was
evaluated by the linear regression model. A value of
P\ 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.
Results
The Mortality After SAH
None of the sham group rats died. And they had not any
evidence of SAH. The mortality of SAH group was 28 %
(23/83).
The Level of SENP3 Protein Expression in Brain
Cortex Following SAH
Low level of SENP3 was identified in the sham group
while the level of SENP3 protein increased significantly by

12 h after experimental SAH, peaked at 24 h and declined
back to baseline level after day 3 post-SAH. There was a
statistically significant difference between the sham group
and 12, 24, 48, day 3 group (P\ 0.01, respectively)
(Figs. 1, 2). The above results demonstrated that SAH
could cause significant up-regulation of SENP3 in the
temporal lobe tissue in the early part of 12 h post-injury,
and keep it at a high level for 3 days. The peak appeared at
24 h post-SAH.
SENP3 mRNA Level in the Brain Cortex After SAH
The expression of SENP3 mRNA was detected by quantitative
real-time PCR. This part of the study showed that
the SENP3 mRNA expression was not changed in the SAH
group which was in a time-dependent manner contrast to
the counterpart in sham group (Fig. 3).
Expression and Distribution of SENP3 in Brain Cortex
After SAH
The expression and distribution of SENP3 were identified
by IHC staining and immunofluorescence staining. SENP3
expression could be observed in both the sham and 24 h
post-SAH group. However, robust expression of SENP3
could seldom be observed in the sham group while it
obviously enhanced in 24 h post-SAH group (Fig. 4).
Semi-quantitative analysis proved that there was a
statistical signification between the sham group and the
24 h post-SAH group (P\ 0.01) (Fig. 5). To identify in
which kind of brain cells SENP3 was increased in 24 h
post-SAH group, double immunofluorescence staining was
detected for SENP3 and different phenotype-specific
markers including neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN),
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium
binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). As shown in Fig. 6,
SENP3 was expressed in both sham group and 24 h post-
SAH group. However, further quantitative analysis of the

co-localization-positive expression proportion showed that
the ratio of NeuN in 24 h post-SAH group significantly
increased, when compared with the counterpart of sham
group. However, SAH did not change the ratio of GFAP-
positive expression proportion and Iba-1 (Fig. 6). These
results revealed that expression of SENP3 was increased
in neurons, but not in astrocytes or microglia in the
injured brain cortex following SAH.
Expression of Cleavage Caspase-3 Increased In Brain
Cortex Following SAH
Our data showed that the total quantity of cleaved caspase-3
is low in the sham group in western blot (Fig. 4).
Compared with that of the sham group, cleaved caspase-
3 in the injured brain tissue was statistically increased as
early as 6 h after SAH and peaked at 24 h post-SAH in
this study. There is obviously positive relationship
between cleaved caspase-3 and SENP3 in protein level
(r = 0.8529, P\ 0.01). Moreover, cleaved caspase-3
IHC staining demonstrated that positive cells could
hardly be found in sham group. In contrast to post-SAH
group, both 24 h group and 3 days group, positive cells
could easily be found (Fig. 7). There were statistical
significances between sham group and each SAH group
(P\ 0.05). In addition, positive cells in 3 day group
statistically decreased compared with counterpart in 24 h
group.
Discussion
In this study, we reported that the protein expression of
SENP3 was up-regulated while gene transcription did not
change in the brain cortex in an experimental rat SAH
model. These results suggest that SENP3 regulation is a
procedure after transcription. IHC and immunofluorescence
staining demonstrated that the SENP3-positive cells
were obviously increased in the brain cortex. Moreover,
expression of SENP3 was increased in neurons, rather than
in astrocytes or microglia in the injured brain cortex following
SAH. Meanwhile, the protein level of cleaved
caspase-3 was also dramatically increased after SAH. A
positive correlation between SENP3 and cleaved caspase-3
could be found through statistical analysis, suggesting that
SENP3 might play a role in inducing apoptosis in EBI
following SAH, which may conduce to the poor outcome
of SAH.
Over Expression of SENP3 in Protein Level
Conjugation of SUMO to specific substrates which are
certain cellular proteins mediates numerous cell signaling
pathways including protein stabilization, apoptosis, intracellular
transport, and regulation of transcription (Tan et al.
2010). The covalent modification by SUMO, a isopeptide
bond, is invertible and regulated by a family of sentrin/
SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (Yeh and Gong 2000).
SENP3 (SMT3IP1), a member in this family, has been

proved to function as a SUMO-specific protease (Hay
2005). It is demonstrated that SENP3, as an isopeptidase,
cleaves the isopeptide bond between lysine side chain of a
substrate and the glycine residue of SUMO (Yeh and Gong
2000). Normal level of SENP3 which deconjugates
modified proteins is considerable for keeping balance
between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation. The balance
is essential for guarantying normal physiology (Bawa-
Khalfe 2010). For example, elevated SENP3 can be
detected in both prostate cancer and additional carcinomas

including ovarian, lung, rectum, and colon (Han et al.
2010). It is reported that overexpression of SENP3 in cells
resulted in the accumulation of Mdm2 in the nucleolus and
increased stability of the p53 protein (Nishida and Yamada
2011). SENP3 reverses SUMOylation of nucleophosmin
and is indispensable for rRNA processing (Haindl et al.
2008). Moreover, in CNS, proof of up-regulated SENP3 in
neurons could be found, especially in a SCI model and an
ischemia model. It is reported that up-regulated SENP3
was mostly located in neurons in SCI rats (Guo et al. 2013;
Wei et al. 2012). In this study, overexpression of SENP3
was also found in the cerebral cortex after experimental
SAH in rats, which matched the previous findings in CNS.
What is more, it peaked at 24 h post-SAH and was presented
mostly in neurons rather than in astrocytes or
microglia.
No Change of SENP3 Gene Transcription
It is clear that SENP3 protein levels can be mediated via
reactive oxygen species (ROS); a binding of Hsp90 to
SENP3 leads to SENP3 stabilization under oxidative
stress (accumulation of ROS), and that this is achieved
by blockage of the CHIP-mediated ubiquitination which
is constantly under non-stress (Yan et al. 2010). EBI
after SAH immediately appears after insult. It is widely
accepted that EBI is associated with ischemia following
SAH, destruction of blood brain barrier, simulation of
hemolytic products and apoptosis of neural cells (Gaetani
et al. 1990). All factors above can contribute to oxidative
stress, especially to the accumulation of ROS. It is
proved that accumulated ROS after SAH contributes to
brain edema in rats. When this change had been recovered
, neurological impairment avoided consequently (Lu
et al. 2009). In a in vitro experiment, H
2
O
2
induced a
high level expression of SENP3 in neurons (Wei et al.
2012). In this study, protein levels of SENP3 increased
and mRNA levels of SENP3 did not change after SAH,
which proved that SENP3 regulation following SAH is a
cellular procedure after transcription. Furthermore, considering
increased ROS after SAH, induced high
expression of SENP3 by H
2
O
2
and the mechanism of
SENP3 stabilization, as mentioned above, a hypothesis
should be concluded that overexpression of SENP3 is a
post-translation procedure, which is induced by accumulated
ROS following SAH.

Increased Expression of SENP3 and Apoptosis
Lots of studies have indicated that apoptosis is involved in
the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury including EBI
after SAH (Cahill 2006). Following SAH, apoptosis has
been detected in the cortex, hippocampus, vasculature,
and blood brain barrier (Yuksel 2012; Zubkov et al. 2001;
Park et al. 2004; Ostrowski and Colohan 2005; Zhou et al. 
2005). Different kinds of apoptotic pathways including
the death receptor pathway, caspase-dependent pathway,
caspase-independent pathway, and the mitochondrial
pathway are activated after SAH (Cahill 2006). In addition
, relationship between SENP3 and apoptosis was
discussed in several studies. It is demonstrated that
increased expression of SENP3 restrained Mdm2-mediated
p53 ubiquitination and consequential degradation in
proteasome (Nishida and Yamada 2011). The expression
of SENP3 rose in rat SCI model. Moreover, the colocalization
of SENP3 and cleaved-caspase-3 was
checked in the spinal cord (Wei et al. 2012). It is proved
that depletion of SENP3 prolongs Drp1 SUMOylation,
which suppressed Drp1-mediated cytochrome c release
and caspase-mediated neurons death in an ischemia model
(Guo et al. 2013). In this study, the protein level of
cleaved caspase-3 was dramatically elevated and reached
the maximum in its protein level after 24 h post-SAH and
histological method confirmed this result. What is more,
there was a positive relationship between SENP3 and
cleaved caspase-3. The correlation implied that SENP3
might play a role in inducing apoptosis in EBI following
SAH, which may conduce to the poor outcome of SAH.
To demonstrate this assumption, further studies with
intervention of SENP3 are still needed.
Summary
To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the
expression of SENP3 in the brain after SAH. It is found
that SAH caused an obvious up-regulation of SENP3
protein expression in rat brain, especially in neurons.
However, mRNA expressions of SENP3 remained
unchanged. In addition, it could be postulated that SENP3
might play an important role in the EBI after SAH.
However, the full role of SENP3 in EBI needs further
investigation.
