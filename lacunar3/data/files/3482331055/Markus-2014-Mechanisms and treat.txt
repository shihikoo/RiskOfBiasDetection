Mechanisms and treatment of ischaemic 
stroke—insights from genetic associations
Hugh S. Markus and Steve Bevan
Abstract | The precise pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke is unclear, and a greater understanding of the 
different mechanisms that underlie large-artery, cardioembolic and lacunar ischaemic stroke subtypes would 
enable the development of more-effective, subtype-specific therapies. Genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs) are identifying novel genetic variants that associate with the risk of stroke. These associations 
provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms, and present opportunities for novel therapeutic 
approaches. In this Review, we summarize the genetic variants that have been linked to ischaemic stroke in 
GWASs to date and discuss the implications of these associations for both our understanding and treatment 
of ischaemic stroke. The majority of genetic variants identified are associated with specific subtypes of 
ischaemic stroke, implying that these subtypes have distinct genetic architectures and pathophysiological 
mechanisms. The findings from the GWASs highlight the need to consider whether therapies should be 
subtype-specific. Further GWASs that include large cohorts are likely to provide further insights, and emerging 
technologies will complement and build on the GWAS findings.

Introduction
Though sometimes thought of as a uniform disease, stroke 
is the end result of many different pathophysiological 
processes, which result in multiple subtypes (Box 1). 
Identification of individual stroke subtypes requires a 
detailed clinical work-up, but even with appropriate 
investigations, an underlying pathology cannot be found 
in 25–40% of patients with ischaemic stroke.1 This heterogeneity
implies that different pathological mechanisms 
are responsible for different subtypes of stroke; identification
of genetic variations that are associated with these 
subtypes might provide insight into these mechanisms 
and provide opportunities to develop new, more-effective 
therapeutic approaches.
Studies of twins and analyses of family history both 
suggest a substantial genetic predisposition to stroke, 
with implications for how molecular genetic studies 
of stroke are conducted and interpreted.2–4 Family 
history data suggest that genetic predisposition differs 
by subtype of stroke, with greater familial associations 
for large-artery and small-artery (lacunar) stroke 
than for cardioembolic stroke.3 These data also indicate 
that stroke and coronary artery disease share genetic 
factors, as a family history of coronary artery disease is 
associated with an increased risk of large-artery stroke,5
and a family history of stroke is associated with acute 
coronary syndrome.6 Furthermore, a family history 
of stroke is also strongly associated with risk factors 
for stroke, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, 
which makes it important to determine whether any 
identified genetic factors predispose patients to stroke 
indirectly via risk factors, or independently of the risk 
factors.7 Sex differences have also been reported: women 
were found to be approximately 50% more likely to have 
a maternal history of stroke than a paternal history of 
stroke, whereas no similar excess exists in men.8
To date, the candidate gene approach to complex diseases
, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus
, has proven disappointing, and this has also been the 
case for stroke. Associations with stroke have been 
reported for a number of candidate genes, but few of 
these findings have been replicated.9 Possible reasons for 
this lack of replication include small sample size, publication
bias, and a failure to recognize the phenotypic 
heterogeneity of stroke.10
By contrast, the use of genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) technology, in combination with very large 
sample sizes and rigorous replication, has had a major 
impact on our current understanding of the pathogenesis 
of complex diseases, with well over 1,000 novel associations
reported.11 Unlike the candidate gene approach, 
GWASs allow detection of completely novel and unexpected
associations owing to the fact that as many as 
10 million genetic markers can be directly genotyped, and 
imputation allows estimates of over 15 million markers to 
provide coverage of the whole genome (Box 2).
GWASs in stroke initially lagged behind those in other 
complex diseases, but larger GWASs have begun to identify
novel genetic associations with stroke. To date, the 
findings of these studies have had little immediate clinical
impact; nevertheless, they are providing insights into 
the pathophysiology of stroke and could open up novel,

previously unexpected treatment strategies. The GWAS 
data might also have important generic implications for 
the way that treatments for stroke are designed.
Here, we review the progression of GWAS use for 
identifying genetic associations with stroke, and summarize
the specific genetic loci that have been associated
with different subtypes of stroke to date. We explore 
the implications of these associations for the clinician in 
terms of predictive testing, therapeutic potential, and the 
impact on clinical management, as well as the insights 
into stroke pathophysiology, and consider aspects that 
need to be addressed in future studies to maximize the 
potential of GWASs. This Review focuses on findings in 
ischaemic stroke, although advances are also being made 
in intracerebral haemorrhage,12 including the genetics of 
intracranial aneurysms.13
GWASs in stroke
The use of GWASs has already identified a number of 
novel variants associated with risk of stroke (Table 1), 
and has provided important insights into the genetic 
basis of this disease.
Early studies
Initial studies utilizing GWASs in stroke did not aim to 
identify completely novel stroke-related genes. Instead, 
they focused on genetic variants identified in a range of 
other cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, 
that increase an individual’s risk of stroke. The goal of 
these studies was to determine whether such variants 
were also directly associated with ischaemic stroke.
Variants in two genes associated with atrial fibrillation
, PITX2 and ZFHX3, were found to be independent
risk factors for ischaemic stroke;14,15 further analysis 
determined that these associations were specific to the 
development of cardioembolic stroke.16 PITX2 encodes 
a transcription factor regulated by β-catenin, whereas 
ZFHX3 encodes a zinc finger protein. Furthermore, a 
genetic variant at the 9p21 locus on the short arm of 
chromosome 9 that has a widely reported association 
with myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease17
was associated with ischaemic stroke in a meta-analysis 
across multiple cohorts.18 This association was specific 
to the large-artery subtype of stroke (OR 1.21), and 
was not observed among patients with cardioembolic 
or small-vessel stroke. This region of chromosome 9 
contains genes that encode cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitors (CDKN2A and CDKN2B) and a noncoding 
RNA of unknown function (CDKN2B-AS1, also known 
as ANRIL).
Novel associations
The first widely replicated novel genetic association 
with ischaemic stroke was found in a GWAS conducted 
by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 
(WTCCC2).19 This study enrolled a discovery population 
of approximately 3,500 patients with stroke from four 
centres in Europe, and identified a genetic variant at the 
chromosome 7p21 locus that was associated specifically 
with the large-artery subtype of stroke (OR 1.42).19 This 
association was replicated in the same study in a further 
6,000 patients from Europe, America and Australia,19 and 
in subsequent studies.20,21
The 7p21 locus resides between two recombination
hotspots that encompass the 3' end of the histone 
deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene, making it likely that this 
gene underlies the observed association with large-artery 
stroke.19 The variants identified in the WTCCC2 GWAS, 
and a nearby linked variant that was identified in a subsequent
meta-analysis (METASTROKE),20 are located 
within the introns of HDAC9 rather than in the coding 
regions. However, the primary HDAC9 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) that was identified in the 
METASTROKE study may have an effect on gene regulation
; it lies within a DNAse hypersensitivity cluster and 
its sequence is conserved in mammals—observations 
that are consistent with this SNP being a functional 
variant. Whether or not this particular variant underlies
the association of HDAC9 with large-artery stroke, 
or is merely a marker for another nearby causal variant, 
remains to be determined.22
Stroke subtype-specific associations
Further GWASs have reported specific associations 
with different subtypes of stroke. For example, a genetic 
variant located at chromosome 6p21.1 was associated 
Key points
■ Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of novel 
genetic variants that are associated with a risk of ischaemic stroke
■ Most genetic variants identified in GWASs of stroke to date are associated with 
specific pathophysiological subtypes, including large-artery and cardioembolic 
stroke
■ Associations of specific genes with specific subtypes of stroke provide insight 
into the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved, which could lead to 
the development of novel therapeutic approaches
■ Insights into stroke pathophysiology provided by genetic associations suggest 
the need for evaluation of treatments in different subtypes and for reliable 
systems to classify subtypes
■ Larger GWAS cohorts and new approaches such as next-generation sequencing 
will identify more genetic variants associated with ischaemic stroke to further 
improve understanding of the disease and clinical care
Box 1 | Subtypes of ischaemic stroke
Large-artery stroke
Large-artery stroke results from atherosclerotic plaques 
in the carotid, verterbral or major intracerebral arteries. 
Plaques become unstable, leading to thrombus 
formation. The thrombus embolizes distally to occlude 
intracerebral vessels.
Cardioembolic stroke
Cardioembolic stroke results from a variety of intracardiac 
pathologies, including atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, 
and the site of a previous myocardial infarction. The 
thrombus forms in the heart and embolizes to the brain.
Small-vessel disease (lacunar stroke)
Small-vessel stroke, also known as lacunar stroke, affects 
the small perforating arteries supplying subcortical 
structures and results in small lacunar infarcts that affect 
the white matter and deep grey matter nuclei. The main 
risk factor is hypertension.

with large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, but not other 
subtypes of stroke, among white populations.23 An ageof-onset
analysis that was weighted towards younger age 
at stroke onset found a specific association of large-artery 
atherosclerotic stroke with a variant in the MMP12 gene, 
which encodes macrophage metalloelastase, also known 
as matrix metalloproteinase 12.24 This observation was 
supported by a study that showed increased levels of 
MMP12 mRNA in the atherosclerotic carotid plaque 
compared with normal arterial wall tissue.24
In contrast to the success of identifying genetic associations
with large-artery and cardioembolic stroke, progress
with small-artery stroke has been slower. A GWAS 
conducted in a group of Japanese patients with ischaemic
stroke identified a genetic variant in PRKCH.23 This 
gene encodes a serine–threonine kinase that regulates 
a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, 
differentiation and apoptosis. The variant identified was 
specifically associated with small-vessel stroke, a result 
that was replicated in both an independent Japanese 
cohort and a Chinese population.25 The same variant was 
also found to be associated with MRI-determined silent 
brain infarction, which has a predominantly small-vessel 
aetiology.26 The identified SNP is monomorphic in white 
populations, so direct replication is not possible in 
these populations, but a large meta-analysis of GWAS 
data from white patients found no association between 
ischaemic stroke and a chromosomal region surrounding 
the PRKCH variant.20
Associations with all ischaemic stroke
Genetic variants that are associated with all types of 
ischaemic stroke have been reported, although in considerably
smaller numbers than variants associated with 
specific subtypes of stroke. A meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies reported that an SNP in the chromosome
12p13 region was associated with all types of 
ischaemic stroke; NINJ2 was suggested to be the underlying
gene.27 However, this association could not be replicated
in large case–control meta-analyses.20,28 The first 
association of a genetic variant with all types of ischaemic
stroke to be replicated convincingly was reported 
with a locus at 12q24 (OR 1.1).29 The same gene region 
has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors, 
including hypertension and type 1 diabetes mellitus,29
although the SNP associated with these diseases was not 
the same as that found to be associated with stroke. The 
mechanism of action, and whether or not the association 
occurs independently of or via conventional risk factors, 
is not clear.
Implications for the clinician
Predictive genetic testing
Genetic variants identified by GWASs have been suggested
as potential predictors of cardiovascular risk in 
individual patients. Consequently, tests have been developed
that use saliva swabs to detect SNPs associated with 
a risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the current 
scientific basis for such approaches in stroke is weak. For 
example, calculations show that 100–300 different genetic 
variants would be required to explain the reported sibling 
relative risk of stroke (2–3),30,31 so the few genetic variants 
that have been associated with stroke to date can only 
account for a fraction of the overall risk. Until additional 
associated genetic variants have been identified and we 
better understand the molecular basis of stroke, this kind 
of predictive testing can provide only limited information.
This view was reflected in the decision by the FDA 
in 2013 to ban direct marketing of saliva-based DNA tests 
by the company 23andMe.32
There are other challenges in implementing personalized
testing for patients with complex diseases such 
as stroke. Patient compliance with strategies to reduce 
established stroke risk factors, such as hypertension and 
smoking, is often poor, and might not improve even 
in those who have a high genetic risk. Furthermore, 
patients with a low genetic risk might take less care to 
minimize general risk factors, thereby increasing their 
risk of stroke. A recent review found conflicting results 
on whether smoking cessation—a major behavioural 
risk factor for stroke—was increased after genetic profiling
for the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene 
status, which is associated with risk of lung cancer.33 The 
Box 2 | Genome-wide association studies
Genome-wide association studies search the genome for 
small variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) that occur more frequently in people with a 
particular disease than in people without the disease. The 
method uses fluorescent labelling of DNA in microarrays to 
type as many as 5 million or more SNPs. The frequency of 
each SNP in individuals with the disease is compared with 
the frequency in healthy controls. Due to the very large 
number of statistical comparisons involved, a high level of 
statistical significance is used, and the P value threshold 
for significance is <5×10–8. Detection of a significant 
association does not mean that the identified SNP is 
causal; it is usually merely a marker for a causal functional 
SNP that is located on a nearby region of the genome.

review concluded that more data are needed to determine
the effects of genetic information on the success of 
behavioural risk factor modification.
For these reasons, individual predictive genetic testing 
is not a current reality. In the immediate future, stroke 
variants identified using GWASs are more likely to provide 
novel insights into specific aspects of stroke pathogenesis, 
allowing new treatment pathways to be developed, and 
more-general insights into the pathophysiology of stroke, 
with broader clinical implications.
Novel variants with therapeutic potential
Although progress has been slower than initially hoped, 
information from GWASs is now being used to develop 
novel treatments for complex diseases, such as macular 
degeneration,34 autoimmune disease35 and hypercholesterolaemia.36 Though still a long way from clinical
translation, the HDAC9 association identified in the 
WTCCC2 study highlights how GWASs might lead to 
new potential therapies for stroke.
HDAC9 belongs to a family of genes that encode 
proteins that deacetylate histones, thereby regulating 
chromatin structure and gene transcription.37 HDAC9
is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels of expression 
in cardiac muscle tissue and brain. The specific association
of HDAC9 with large-artery stroke suggests that the 
variant somehow increases the risk of atherosclerosis or 
plaque instability. One way of determining whether the 
HDAC9 variant is associated with early atherosclerosis 
is to look for associations with asymptomatic carotid 
plaque and carotid intima–media thickness in community
populations. One study that used ultrasonography 
to determine the presence of asymptomatic plaques in 
25,179 individuals and carotid intima–media thickness
in 31,210 individuals found statistically significant 
associations between the HDAC9 variant and both of 
these phenotypes.38
HDAC9 is expressed in the endothelial and smooth 
muscle cells of both intracranial and systemic large arteries
, including the carotid, middle cerebral and coronary 
arteries.39 Levels of HDAC9 mRNA expression were 
found to be elevated above normal levels in carotid 
atherosclerotic plaques compared with nondiseased 
arterial wall.38 Interestingly, this elevation was seen to a 
greater degree in carotid plaques than in atherosclerotic 
plaques elsewhere in the body. The reasons for this difference
are unknown, although the HDAC9 variant was 
recently associated with coronary artery disease,40 and 
it is of interest that this association was weaker than the 
association with large-artery stroke.
Taken together, these data suggest that the HDAC9 
variant increases atherosclerosis, particularly at the carotid 
bifurcation. This raises the intriguing possibility that 
modulation of this pathway might reduce atherosclerosis 
and the risk of large-artery stroke. The commonly used 
antiepileptic drug sodium valproate nonspecifically inhibits
histone deacetylase 9, the protein product of HDAC9, 
and can protect against atherosclerosis in animal models.41
Sodium valproate therapy was associated with lower 
stroke and myocardial risk rates compared with other 
antiepileptic drugs in a large community-based study,42
although a replication study provided more-ambiguous 
results.43 In this second study, treatment with sodium valproate
was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial 
infarction, but not with a reduced risk of ischaemic stroke 
overall. However, ischaemic stroke risk correlated inversely 
with the duration of sodium valproate treatment.43
Further studies are now needed to map the 7p21.1 
locus in detail and identify causal variants to confirm 
that these affect the HDAC9 gene function. Functional 
studies and intervention studies using histone deacetylase
inhibitors in animal models will provide further 
information as to whether inhibition of histone 
deacetylase 9 does indeed offer a feasible approach to 
stroke prevention.
Insights into stroke pathophysiology
The fact that the majority of associations reported in 
GWASs of ischaemic stroke have been specific to one 
subtype of stroke (Table 1) indicates that the genetic 
architecture of the various subtypes differs substantially. 
This is consistent with previous observations, such as 
differential associations between family history and specific
stroke subtypes,3 and the finding that most monogenic
causes of stroke predispose to a single subtype.44
GWASs have now provided convincing support for 
this hypothesis.
The confirmation that different stroke subtypes have 
different pathophysiological mechanisms raises the possibility
that subtype-specific treatments might be necessary.
However, with a few exceptions (such as carotid 
endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis, and 
anticoagulation therapy for secondary prevention of 
cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation), the vast 
majority of stroke treatments currently available have 
been tested in all subtypes of ischaemic stroke.
Stroke GWASs have emphasized the need for rigorous 
subtyping by means of a pathophysiological classification
, such as the system developed for the Trial of Org 
10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) study, which 
classifies stroke according to aetiology.45 Only by classing
stroke into these pathophysiological subtypes has 
it been possible to identify most genetic associations. 
However, classification with the TOAST system requires 
detailed investigation, and exclusion of pathology such 
as large-artery stenosis and cardioembolic sources; 
such information is frequently not available in large 
clinical trials.
Some clinical trials have attempted secondary analyses
to determine treatment efficacy in different subtypes
of stroke; however, the subtyping has usually been 
inadequate to obtain reliable data. A major limitation 
in previous stroke trials that attempted such classification
is that they often used classifications that were 
developed before brain imaging was widely available, 
thereby relying on the clinical syndrome rather than 
test results. As an example of the problems that can 
arise with these classifications, studies have shown that 
small-vessel disease can be markedly over-diagnosed 
if the clinical Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project

(OSCP) classification is used to diagnose the lacunar 
syndrome category, owing to inclusion of a number of 
individuals with stroke due to larger nonlacunar infarcts 
in this group.46,47
Insights into specific pathogenic mechanisms
Genetic information can provide insight into specific 
pathogenic mechanisms, particularly where there are 
questions regarding whether a disease risk factor plays a 
causal role or whether the observed association is a result 
of confounding factors. An illustrative case is provided by 
determination of the appropriate use of antithrombotic 
drugs in secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke.
Considerable evidence—almost all from trials that 
involved all ischaemic stroke types—shows benefits of 
antiplatelet agents in secondary stroke prevention. A 
growing body of data suggests that intensive antiplatelet
regimens, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, could be 
beneficial in large-artery stroke, particularly during the 
first few months after the event.48,49 However, concern 
has been expressed that these regimens might be associated
with an increased risk of intracerebral bleeding in 
small-vessel stroke.
The underlying pathophysiology of lacunar or smallvessel
stroke is less well understood than that of largeartery
and cardioembolic stroke. Lacunar stroke seems 
to belong to a spectrum of small-artery disease, other 
features of which are white matter hyperintensities—or 
leukoaraiosis—seen on T2-weighted MRI, asymptomatic 
microbleeds detected on gradient echo MRI, and symptomatic
subcortical haemorrhage (Figure 1).50 One study 
found overlap between the genetic basis of subcortical 
haemorrhage and ischaemic small-vessel stroke.51
Clinical studies have shown that warfarin treatment 
increases the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage among 
patients with lacunar stroke and leukoaraiosis.52,53 This 
observation demonstrates that the potential overlap 
between lacunar stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage 
makes optimal antithrombotic treatment crucial in 
patients with lacunar stroke; genetic studies could help 
with the optimization.
The role of thrombotic factors in lacunar stroke could 
be evaluated by comparing blood levels of haemostatic
markers among patients who have this condition
with levels in healthy controls, but causality is 
difficult to determine because elevated levels of these 
markers could be secondary to the development of 
stroke rather than being a predisposing factor. A technique
called Mendelian randomization is increasingly 
being used to determine causality in such situations.54
In this technique, one selects a functional variant that 
is associated with an increased level of the marker in 
question, and determines whether it is also associated 
with an increased risk of the phenotype, in this case 
lacunar stroke. This approach has been used successfully
in many cardiovascular diseases; for example, it 
has shown that elevated levels of C-reactive protein in 
patients with cardiovascular disease are likely to be secondary
to atherosclerosis rather than having a causal role 
in disease pathogenesis.55
One study used Mendelian randomization to investigate
the role of haemostatic factors in ischaemic stroke.56
A GWAS identified a variant in the ABO gene that had a 
genome-wide association with haemostatic and thrombotic
markers. The study then tested whether this variant 
was also associated with ischaemic stroke and its subtypes.
A statistically significant association was found 
with large-artery and cardioembolic stroke, but not with 
small-artery stroke.57 These two associations are not 
unexpected, as thromboembolism from an activated 
carotid plaque or from the heart are the primary disease 
mechanisms in these stroke subtypes. However, the lack 
of association with lacunar stroke is interesting, and suggests
that thrombotic factors may be less important for 
this stroke subtype.
This finding emphasizes the need for clinical trials that 
examine the risk-to-benefit ratio of antiplatelet agents as 
a therapeutic option for patients with small-vessel stroke. 
The first large randomized controlled trial to specifically 
recruit patients with MRI-confirmed lacunar stroke was 
published in 2012, and demonstrated that clopidogrel 
alone was more effective than clopidogrel combined 
with aspirin for long-term prevention of recurrent stroke 
after a symptomatic lacunar stroke.57 Adding aspirin to 
the treatment provided little benefit in terms of stroke 
reduction, and significantly increased the risk of bleeding.
The future of GWASs
GWASs have started to provide novel insights into the 
molecular mechanisms that underlie genetic predisposition
to stroke, and further studies in large, wellphenotyped
populations will probably yield additional 
insights. It is important that a number of considerations 
are addressed to maximize the benefits of GWASs in 
identifying associations that have clinical potential.
Bigger sample sizes
Sample sizes analysed in GWASs of stroke are still 
some way behind those for other complex diseases. 
The METASTROKE meta-analysis of ischaemic stroke 
GWASs brought together over 10,000 cases, but this

number only included approximately 2,000 cases of each 
subtype of ischaemic stroke.20 Meta-analyses of GWAS 
data in other complex diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes
mellitus and coronary artery disease, with cohorts 
that range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands
of patients, consistently show that the number of 
variants identified is highly dependent on the sample 
size.58 One challenge in stroke is that studies must be 
adequately powered to detect associations with individual 
stroke subtypes, which requires larger overall numbers 
of participants than for many other complex diseases. 
Therefore, as stroke sample sizes increase further, it is 
highly likely that many additional associations will be 
determined. Further large GWASs of stroke, including the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 
SiGN study, which will contribute another 10,000 stroke 
cases, are nearing completion.59
Accurate classification of subtypes
The subtype specificity of associations identified to 
date highlights the importance of accurate phenotyping 
with a system that classifies according to pathophysiology.
The fact that subtype-specific associations have 
been found by using the TOAST classification system is 
reassuring, but improved subtyping classifications may 
increase the yield further. A computerized algorithm 
may reduce inter-observer differences in classification, 
and this approach has been successfully applied to the 
TOAST system.60
Difficulties with the TOAST system include identifying
the most likely cause where multiple potential 
mechanisms are found, and uncertainty regarding how 
to deal with cases with incomplete diagnostic evaluation.
To address these difficulties, modifications to the 
TOAST system have been developed, including the ASCO 
(Atherosclerosis, Small-vessel disease, Cardiac source, 
Other cause) system,61 and the web-based Causative 
Classification of Stroke (CCS), which is specifically recommended
for genetic studies.62 Comparisons of these 
systems have generally shown good agreement,63,64 but 
future studies will reveal any differences in their ability to 
detect genome-wide associations.
Sex and ethnic differences
GWASs have confirmed many findings from twin and 
family history studies, including different genetic architectures
for different stroke subtypes;19 greater importance
of some variants for younger-onset stroke;24 and 
shared genetic risk factors for coronary artery disease 
and stroke, particularly large-artery stroke.65 Whether or 
not sex differences are important, as suggested by family 
history data,30 remains to be determined by GWASs. 
Further work will also determine the extent to which 
identified genetic risk factors contribute to stroke via 
conventional stroke risk factors and independent effects. 
A genetic risk score based on risk factors already identified
in GWASs did correlate with stroke, but did not add 
predictive information.66
Extensive epidemiological data demonstrate 
marked ethnic differences in stroke incidence and the 
distribution of subtypes. For example, intracranial stenosis
and intracerebral haemorrhage are more frequent in 
Far East Asian populations compared with white populations
,67,68 and small-vessel disease is more common 
among individuals of African ancestry living in London, 
UK or in the USA than in white individuals living in the 
same countries.47,69 However, few studies have been conducted
in non-white populations, and more are needed. 
Whether or not the variants associated with increased 
stroke risk in white populations also increase risk in 
other ethnicities remains to be determined, although 
findings from other complex diseases suggest that most 
associations are likely to be shared by multiple ethnicities.
Admixture mapping using GWAS data, which relies 
on genetic variants that differ in frequency across populations
, might reveal the contribution of genetic factors 
to ethnic differences in stroke, and identify novel genetic 
variants; this approach has been successful in other 
complex traits.70
Emerging techniques in stroke genetics
While GWASs have provided most of the genetic associations
with stroke that have been identified to date, several 
new technologies could complement GWAS findings and 
provide further insights into the genetics of stroke.
GWASs are designed to identify common variants 
that contribute to disease risk, whereas whole-genome 
sequencing can identify rare variants that might contribute.
The cost of whole-genome sequencing has fallen 
dramatically in recent years, and is now just US$1,000 
per genome,71 so could be a more cost-effective approach 
to screening for multiple monogenic causes of stroke in 
a single assay than is the current gene-by-gene testing 
approach.72 The clinical benefits of next-generation 
sequencing are currently being assessed in projects such 
as the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project.73
Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing are also 
being used to identify novel rare variants that could contribute
to common polygenic diseases, including stroke.74
Studies of multiple family members in combination with 
these techniques are likely to be particularly useful for 
determining which variants are causal and which are 
non-causal. Identification of rare variants that contribute
to complex polygenic disease such as apparently 
sporadic stroke will present challenges because larger 
sample sizes are required to detect the low-frequency 
variants, unless the odds ratios associated with such variants
are much greater than those associated with 
GWAS-derived variants.
Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and 
histone modification do not alter the underlying DNA 
sequence, but are heritable and can affect gene expression
and cellular phenotype, and could play a part in 
stroke pathogenesis. Array-based methods can analyse 
patterns of DNA methylation in large populations, akin 
to GWASs at the DNA level. With small patient cohorts, 
this approach has demonstrated differential methylation 
in stroke-relevant risk factors such as BMI,75 lipid levels76
and smoking status.77 In view of the probable importance 
of gene–environment interactions in cardiovascular

disease and stroke, this approach may be particularly 
interesting in stroke.
In light of GWAS findings, there is also a move towards 
investigating the interactions of the transcriptome and 
proteome with each other and with the genome in relation
to disease phenotypes. Identification of motifs such 
as transcription factor binding sites on a genome-wide 
basis is already possible with techniques such as chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation 
sequencing,78 although interpretation is limited by availability
and ongoing development of tools for analysis.79
However, discovering how the interactions between the 
genome, transcriptome and proteome lead to the final 
phenotype is becoming a major focus in unravelling the 
molecular pathology of disease.
Conclusions
The genetic variants that have been associated with 
ischaemic stroke in GWASs to date account for only 
a small proportion of the overall risk of stroke, so the 
clinical impact of the findings has so far been limited. 
However, the novel insights into the pathogenesis of 
ischaemic stroke and its subtypes that are provided by 
these associations can help to direct clinical practice to 
achieve the best outcomes.
Treatment approaches that take into account the different
pathophysiologies of the subtypes of stroke are 
likely to be more successful than approaches that are used 
for all subtypes of stroke. However, randomized clinical 
trials will be required to determine whether responses to 
treatments are indeed subtype-specific, and these trials 
will require the use of a detailed pathophysiological 
system such as the TOAST classification system to ensure 
that subtypes are classified correctly and consistently.
For many of the genetic variants that have been associated
with ischaemic stroke in GWASs, the exact causal 
relationship is yet to be determined. Where individual 
genes are suspected to be responsible for the associations 
with specific loci, such as HDAC9, functional studies are 
needed to determine the precise mechanisms of stroke 
pathogenesis and to enable the development of new 
therapeutics that target these pathways. Focused genetic 
studies that use techniques such as Mendelian randomization
might provide further insights into pathogenesis, 
particularly the role of specific molecules or pathways 
in disease and whether their associations with stroke 
are causal.
The fact that GWASs of stroke have until now included 
relatively small numbers of patients means that applying 
GWASs to much larger stroke cohorts is likely to identify 
further genetic associations. Furthermore, novel techniques
, particularly next-generation sequencing, are likely 
to complement and add to GWAS findings, for example, 
by identifying rare genetic associations that GWASs could 
miss. Such future work is likely to further improve both 
disease understanding and clinical care.
