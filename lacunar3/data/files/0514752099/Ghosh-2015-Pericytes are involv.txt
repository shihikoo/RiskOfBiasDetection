Objective: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL),
the most common inherited small-vessel disease, is associated with vascular aggregation of mutant Notch3 protein,
dysfunction of cerebral vessels, and dementia. Pericytes, perivascular cells involved in microvascular function, express
Notch3. Therefore, we hypothesize that these cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of CADASIL.
Methods: Two-, 7-, and 12-month-old CADASIL mutant mice (TgNotch3R169C) and wild-type controls were examined
regarding Notch3 aggregation in pericytes, the coverage of cerebral vessels by pericytes, pericyte numbers, capillary
density, blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, astrocytic end-feet, and the expression of astrocytic gap junction and
endothelial adherens junction protein using immunostaining and Western blot analysis. In addition, we examined
cerebrovascular CO
2
reactivity using laser Doppler fluxmetry and in vivo microscopy.
Results: With increasing age, mutated Notch3 aggregated around pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Notch3 aggregation
caused significant reduction of pericyte number and coverage of capillaries by pericyte processes (p < 0.01).
These changes were associated with detachment of astrocytic end-feet from cerebral microvessels, leakage of plasma
proteins, reduction in expression of endothelial adherens junction protein, and reduced microvascular reactivity to
CO
2
. Smooth muscle cells were not affected by Notch3 accumulation.
Interpretation: Our results show that pericytes are the first cells affected by Notch3 aggregation in CADASIL mice.
Pericyte pathology causes opening of the BBB and microvascular dysfunction. Therefore, protecting pericytes may
represent a novel therapeutic strategy for vascular dementia.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL
) is the most common cause of monogenic stroke and
vascular dementia.1–3 CADASIL is caused by mutations in
the Notch3 gene that encodes a cell surface receptor on
smooth muscle cells and pericytes.4 The mutated Notch3
receptor (Notch3ECD) accumulates in blood vessels of
CADASIL patients and CADASIL mutant mice. These
aggregates are associated with fibrosis of the arteries and
arterioles, reduced blood flow, and ultimately white matter
lesions, thinning of the cortex, and dementia.5–8
At the cellular level, CADASIL is believed to arise
from the damage and death of smooth muscle cells
(SMCs) in the wall of cerebral vessels due to the

accumulation of mutant Notch3ECD aggregates.3 However,
it was previously shown that SMC viability was not affected
in a CADASIL mouse model.5 Thus, the cell type that ultimately
drives CADASIL pathology remains unclear.
We and others revealed an important role for cerebral
pericytes (perivascular cells located between the capillary
endothelium and astrocytic end-feet) in the
regulation of microvascular function and in maintaining
the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB).9–14
Because pericytes contain contractile elements, they may
be an important regulator of cerebral blood flow at the
capillary level under both physiological and pathological
conditions.14,15 Pericytes express the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) and are responsible
for the function and survival of endothelial cells and for
sufficient expression of tight junction proteins.16 Thus,
pericytes play a central role in maintaining microvascular
perfusion and in the proper functioning of the BBB.
The Notch3 receptor is also expressed in capillary
pericytes, and recent electron microscopy studies found
altered pericyte morphology in CADASIL mice.17,18
However, the functional relevance of these findings is
unclear, and the role of pericytes in the initiation and
progression of CADASIL is currently unknown. Therefore
, the aim of this study was to examine whether pericytes
play a role in the pathogenesis of CADASIL.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Mice were bred at the Zentrum f€ ur Neuropathologie und Prionforschung
animal facility (Munich, Germany), and experiments were
approved by the Government of Upper Bavaria (protocol no. 220/30).
Randomization and Blinding
All experiments were performed using a randomized and
blinded protocol, and data were analyzed by a researcher who
was blinded with respect to the genotype of the mice.
Subjects
CO
2
reactivity was measured using 7-month-old and 12-monthold
FVB/N mice (n5 21 and 22 mice, respectively). The immunofluorescence
staining and Western blot experiments were performed
using 2-month-old, 7-month-old, and 12-month-old
FVB/N mice (n5 6 mice/group, for a total of 72 mice).
The following lines of mice used for this study: wild type
(nontransgenic); TgNotch3WT mice, which overexpress the wildtype
rat Notch3 protein; and TgNotch3R169C mice, which overexpress
rat Notch3 with the R169C mutation. The TgNotch3R169C
line is an established mouse model for CADASIL.5
Surgical Procedure for Investigating In Vivo
Microvascular Reactivity
The mice had free access to food and water before surgery. The
surgical procedure was performed as previously described.19,20
In brief, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of midazolam (5mg/kg; Braun, Melsungen, Germany), fentanyl
(0.05mg/kg; Jansen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany), and
medetomidine (0.5mg/kg; Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany), after
which the mice were intubated with an endotracheal tube and
mechanically ventilated. Body temperature and end-tidal pCO2
were monitored continuously. A cannula was placed in the left
femoral artery and used to monitor blood pressure and measure
blood gases; all values were within their respective normal range
throughout the experiments.
Intravital Microscopy
Intravital microscopy was performed as previously described.21
In brief, a 43 4mm cranial window was drilled above the right
parietal cortex, leaving the dura mater intact. The exposed dura
mater was rinsed periodically with saline. The pial vessels were
visualized by an arterial injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-dextran prior to the first measurement. Four regions of
interest (ROIs) containing pial arterioles, venules, and capillaries
were investigated. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured
using a laser Doppler probe positioned over the territory of the
middle cerebral artery.
Baseline values were measured after the physiological
parameters were stable. CBF and vessel diameter were measured
after fixing CO
2
at 10% in the ventilator to increase arterial
pCO
2
for 15 minutes. After this time, pCO
2
was returned to
normal levels, and CBF and vessel diameter were recorded for an
additional 15 minutes (ie, 30 minutes in total). The response of
pial arterioles to CO
2
and the CBF response to CO
2
were both
integrated only during the time of CO
2
inhalation, which was
for 15 minutes. Images were recorded and analyzed at310 magnification.
Arterial blood pressure was monitored throughout the
experiment to ensure that any changes in CBF were not due to a
change in systemic blood pressure.
Analysis of the Pial Microvasculature
Vessel diameter was quantified using image analysis software (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For graphical and statistical representations
, the vessels were categorized by diameter as follows:
<10mm, 10 to 20mm, 20 to 30mm, 30 to 50mm, and >50mm.
The average vessel diameter (expressed as a percentage of baseline)
in each category was compared between groups of animals. Vessels
20 to 30mm in diameter were used for further analysis.
Vibratome Sectioning and Immunofluorescence
Staining (Fluorescent Lectin Staining and Tissue
Immunofluorescence Staining)
Mice were anesthetized and arterially perfused with lectin, after
which they were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 0.9%
sodium chloride (NaCl) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The
brains were removed and postfixed overnight in PFA. Coronal
sections of the cerebral cortex (50mm thick) were prepared
using a VS1200 vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany
). The free-floating sections were collected either in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immediate use or in a cryoprotectant
solution (for later use). The sections were then

processed for immunostaining. Three sections per brain were
used for immunostaining. Sections were blocked with 3%
bovine serum albumin (wt/vol) for 60 minutes, and then incubated
with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight
at 48C. The sections were then washed in PBS and were
incubated in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2
hours at room temperature. The sections were then washed and
mounted using Fluoromount mounting medium (Sigma, St
Louis, MO). The following primary antibodies were used: for
smooth muscle cells, Cy3-conjugated anti–alpha smooth muscle
actin (a-SMA; 1:100, Sigma, C6198); for pericytes, goat anti-
PDGFRb (1:100; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; AF1042),
rabbit antidesmin (1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA; MAB3430),
and rabbit anti–aminopeptidase N (1:100; Antibodies Online,
Aachen, Germany; ABIN359551); for astrocytes: mouse anti–
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:100, Sigma, G3893) and
rabbit anti–aquaporin-4 (1:100, Millipore, AB2218); for plasma
protein, mouse antialbumin (1:100, Sigma, A6684) and rabbit
antifibrinogen (1:100; Dako, Carpinteria, CA; A0080). To visualize
PGDFRb-positive pericytes, sections were incubated in
secondary Cy3-conjugated donkey antigoat antibody (1:100;
Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 705165147). To
visualize desmin-positive pericytes, fibrinogen extravasation, and
aquaporin-4–positive astrocytes, sections were incubated in secondary
Cy3-conjugated donkey antirabbit antibody (1:100,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711165152). To visualize GFAP-
positive astrocytes and albumin, sections were incubated in secondary
Cy3-conjugated donkey antimouse antibody (1:100,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715165150). For triple fluorescence
measurements, the following secondary antibodies were also
used: Alexa Fluor 680 goat antirabbit IgG (1:100; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA; A21109) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat antimouse
IgG (1:100, Invitrogen, A21057).
Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy
All tissue sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M
inverted fluorescence microscope and a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal
microscope. Quantitative image analysis was performed by
an investigator who was blinded with respect to the genotype
and treatment group (ImageJ software; NIH, Bethesda, MD).
CAPILLARY DENSITY IN THE CORTEX. To quantify capillary
density, maximum projection z stacks were reconstructed. The
lectin-positive signal in the blood vessels was subjected to automated
threshold processing after background correction, and
the signal was quantified using the Area Measurement analysis
tool in ImageJ. In each mouse, 4 ROIs in the cortex were analyzed
by randomly selecting 4 fields. These fields were analyzed
in 3 nonadjacent sections (at 100mm intervals). Six animals
per group were analyzed.
NOTCH3 COVERAGE, SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL COVERAGE,
PERICYTE COVERAGE, AND ASTROCYTE END-FEET COVERAGE
IN THE CORTEX. For analyzing coverage, maximum projection z stacks were reconstructed. The Notch3 5E1, a-SMA,
PDGFRb, GFAP, and lectin signals in the capillaries were subjected
to automated threshold processing after background correction.
The areas occupied by their respective signals were
analyzed using the Area Measurement tool in ImageJ. Notch3,
SMC, pericyte, and astrocyte end-feet coverage was determined
as the percentage of Notch3 5E1–, a-SMA–, PDGFRb-, and
GFAP-positive surface area covering lectin-positive capillary surface
area per field (4103 410mm), respectively. In each mouse,
4 ROIs in the cortex were analyzed by randomly selecting 4
fields. These fields were analyzed in 3 nonadjacent sections (at
100mm intervals). Six animals per group were analyzed.
PERICYTE NUMBERS IN THE CORTEX. The number of
PDGFRb-positive pericytes per square millimeter of selected
field area (410 3 410mm) was analyzed. In each mouse, 4
ROIs in the cortex were analyzed by randomly selecting 4
fields. These fields were analyzed in 3 nonadjacent sections (at
100mm intervals). Six animals per group were analyzed.
FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY ANALYSIS OF EXTRAVASCULAR
ALBUMIN AND FIBRINOGEN DEPOSITS. Endogenous
mouse albumin and fibrinogen were detected using the fluorescent
antialbumin signal and the fluorescent antifibrinogen signal
, respectively. To quantify extravascular albumin and
fibrinogen accumulation, maximum projection z stacks were
reconstructed. The albumin- and fibrinogen-positive signal outside
of the blood vessels was subjected to threshold processing
after background correction, and the signal was quantified using
the Integrated Density analysis tool in ImageJ. In each mouse,
4 ROIs in the cortex were analyzed by randomly selecting 4
fields. These fields were analyzed in 3 nonadjacent sections
(at100mm intervals). Six animals per group were analyzed.
Western Blot Analysis
The cerebral cortex was homogenized and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer containing 50mM Tris (pH 8.0),
150mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1.0% NP-
40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The lysates were then separated
using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked
with 4% powdered milk (wt/vol). The membranes were then
incubated in the primary antibody, followed by the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody.
Bands were detected using the Immobilon Western ECL detection
reagent (Millipore), exposed to a Fusion Fx7 imager
equipped with a 4.2/10 mio pixel CCD camera (Peqlab, Erlangen
, Germany), and imaged using Fusion software (Peqlab).
The following primary antibodies were used for the Western
blot analysis: rabbit anti–VE-cadherin antibody (1:1,000;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ab33168) and rabbit anti-connexin43
/GJA1 antibody (1:1,000, Abcam, ab11370). Mouse
anti–b-tubulin antibody (1:1,000, Sigma, T8328) was used as a
loading control. The following secondary antibodies were used:
HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit (1:10,000; Pierce Biotechnology
, Rockford, IL; 31464) and HRP-conjugated goat antimouse
(1:10,000, Pierce, 31432).

Relative Protein Abundance
The protein bands were analyzed for densitometry using the
Gel Analysis tool in ImageJ. The signal intensity of each protein
band was normalized to the respective b-tubulin band to
adjust for any minor differences in total protein loading.
Statistical Analysis
For the in vivo study, the data were analyzed using Sigma Plot
12.5 (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany). The results for the
CO
2
reactivity experiments are presented as the mean6 standard
error of the mean (SEM) or as the median 6 75/25 percentiles.
Differences between groups were analyzed using the Mann–
Whitney rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction. Differences
with a p-value< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
All other analyses were performed using Prism 4 (Graph-
Pad Software, La Jolla, CA). All data were analyzed using the
D’Agostino–Pearson omnibus test for normality and were
found to be distributed normally. Accordingly, multiple group
comparisons were analyzed using a 1-way analysis of variance
followed by a Tukey post hoc analysis. Correlation was tested
using Pearson correlation analysis. Data are reported as the
mean6 SEM. Differences with a p-value < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Increased Notch3 Aggregation in CADASIL
Mice
To study the location of pericytes within the neurovascular
unit, we first examined the intimate relationship
between GFAP-positive astrocytes (labeled in red),
PDGFRb-positive pericytes (labeled in blue), and lectinpositive
brain endothelial cells (labeled in green) in the
mouse cortex (Fig 1A). As shown in the figure inset, in
wild-type mice, pericyte processes cover most of the abluminal
side of the brain capillary endothelial cells, and
astrocytic end-foot processes sheath the microvessel wall
(composed of endothelial cells and pericytes).
We next investigated the vascular changes in transgenic
CADASIL mice (TgNotch3R169C) at 2, 7, and 12 
months of age; these changes were compared with agematched
wild-type (nontransgenic) mice. The accumulation
of Notch3 protein is a hallmark feature of CADASIL;
consistent with this feature, we found an age-dependent
increase in the accumulation of mutant Notch3 proteins in
the cortical vessels of TgNotch3R169C mice (representative
brain sections at 12 months of age are shown in Fig 1B,
C). Age-dependent quantification of Notch3 aggregation in
TgNotch3R169C mice compared to age-matched wild-type
littermates shows a 2-fold and 3-fold increase at 7 and 12
months of age, respectively (see Fig 1D).
Decreased Pericyte Coverage and Pericyte
Number in CADASIL Mice
As Notch3 is also expressed in pericytes, we examined
the microvasculature at the capillary level. Using dual
immunostaining for PDGFRb (to label pericytes) and
FITC-labeled tomato lectin (to stain endothelial cells),
we examined the morphology and profile of pericytes in

the TgNotch3R169Cand wild-type mice. Consistent with
previous reports,15,22 at 7 months of age wild-type pericytes
had typical fusiform and protruding cell bodies
with extended, fingertip-like processes on the vessel
(Fig 2). Pericytes were also identified on the basis of their
expression of the marker proteins aminopeptidase-N and
desmin (data not shown) by immunostaining. We then
examined the proximity of the Notch3 deposits to the
pericytes by performing triple immunostaining in 12-
month-old TgNotch3R169C mice. Our analysis shows
that the Notch3 aggregates colocalize with the pericyte’s
cell body and processes on the capillaries. We also found
an age-dependent progressive loss of pericyte coverage in
the capillaries of TgNotch3R169C mice compared
with age-matched wild-type littermates. Age-dependent

mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates
shows a loss of 30% and 50% at 7 and 12 months of
age, respectively. This observation was also reconfirmed
by age-dependent quantification of desmin-positive pericyte
coverage in TgNotch3R169C mice (data not shown).
While counting PDGFRß-positive cell bodies of pericytes
, we also found a significant and age-dependent
decrease in TgNotch3R169C mice compared with agematched
wild-type littermates in 12-month-old mice
(around 15%). Interestingly, the reduction of pericyte cell
numbers was smaller than the overall loss of pericyte coverage
of microvessels over time, which may indicate a stronger
and early adverse effect of Notch3 aggregation on pericyte
processes than on the cell survival itself. In addition, there
was a negative correlation between age-dependent loss in
pericyte coverage and Notch3 aggregation, indicating that
progressive pericyte degeneration is associated with progressive
age-dependent Notch3 accumulation.

Loss of Pericytes Is Associated with BBB
Dysfunction
The function and integrity of the BBB is regulated by
pericytes9,13,23; therefore, we examined the impact of
pericyte loss on BBB integrity in TgNotch3R169C mice.
To test whether the progressive degeneration of pericytes
in aged CADASIL mice affects the BBB, we measured
the extravasation of albumin and fibrinogen, two plasma
proteins that are not present in the brain parenchyma
under normal conditions. Immunostaining revealed significant
age-dependent extravasation and accumulation of
albumin in the cortex of TgNotch3R169C mice compared
with wild-type littermates (Fig 3). Age-dependent
quantification of extravascular albumin deposits in
TgNotch3R169C mice compared to age-matched wildtype
littermates showed approximately a 3-fold and 4-
fold increase at 7 and 12 months of age, respectively.
Moreover, we also observed increased levels of extravascular
fibrinogen deposits in the cortex of TgNotch3R169C
mice compared with wild-type littermates. Agedependent
quantification of extravascular fibrinogen
deposits in TgNotch3R169C mice showed approximately
2-fold and 3-fold increase at 7 and 12 months of age,
respectively. This increase in albumin and fibrinogen
extravasation developed in parallel with the agedependent
loss of pericytes, suggesting that pericyte loss
is associated with the breakdown in the BBB in CADASIL
mice.

Loss of Astrocytic End-Foot Coverage and
Redistribution of Astrocyte Polarized Markers in
CADASIL Mice
In addition to pericytes, astrocytes are also an integral
component of the neurovascular unit; specifically, astrocytic
end-feet are in close contact with the vasculature.13,24,25 We therefore investigated whether astrocytes
are altered in CADASIL mice. GFAP immunostaining in
wild-type mice showed a distinct protoplastic population
of astrocytes in the cortex, with the astrocytic end-feet in
contact with microvessels (Fig 4A). GFAP is expressed in
the processes, cell bodies, and end-feet of stellate astrocytes.26,27 In 12-month-old TgNotch3R169C mice, we
found significantly reduced levels of astrocytic end-feet
staining around the microvessels; this effect was observed
throughout the cortex and was accompanied by a retraction
of their end-feet (see Fig 4B). Age-dependent quantification
of astrocytic end-feet coverage in TgNotch3R169C
mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates
showed approximately 50% and 70% reduction at 7 and
12 months of age, respectively (see Fig 4C).
We also examined the expression of aquaporin-4, a
specific marker for polarized astrocytic end-feet. Unlike
GFAP, which predominantly stains astrocytic processes,
end-feet, and cell bodies, aquaporin-4 showed uniform
labeling of astrocytic end-feet around blood vessels (see
Fig 4D). Using aquaporin-4 staining, we found that the
astrocytic end-feet are organized abnormally in
TgNotch3R169C mice. Specifically, aquaporin-4 staining
was irregular in 12-month-old TgNotch3R169C mice and
we saw the presence of the characteristic aquaporin-4–
positive bridge-like projections13 between adjacent lectinpositive
vessels (see Fig 4E). Using triple immunostaining
for fibrinogen (labeled in magenta), GFAP (labeled in
red), and lectin (labeled in green), we found that fibrinogen
extravasation occurred in close proximity to retracted
astrocytic end-feet near the blood vessels, indicating
that the BBB is compromised at the site of pathology
(see Fig 4F).
Decreased Endothelial Adherens Junction
Proteins in CADASIL Mice
Endothelial adherens junction proteins form a barrier
that controls the passage of molecules from the blood to
the brain, and their expression is markedly reduced when
the BBB is compromised.13,16 We therefore investigated

whether expression of the adherens junction protein VE-
cadherin is altered in TgNotch3R169C mice. Using Western
blot analysis, we found a significant progressive
decrease in VE-cadherin levels in the cortex of
TgNotch3R169C mice compared to age-matched wildtype
littermates (Fig 5A, B). We also measured the levels
of connexin-43, an astrocytic gap junction protein,28–30
in our CADASIL model; however, we found no change in
connexin-43 expression in the cortex of TgNotch3R169C
mice (see Fig 5C, D).
No Change in Smooth Muscle Cells Coverage
and Capillary Density in CADASIL Mice
CADASIL is also known as an SMC degenerative disease.3,5 We therefore examined the coverage of SMCs on
cortical arterioles by performing staining for a-SMA.
However, we found no a-SMA–positive cells in the capillaries.
Moreover, although CADASIL is generally believed
to be primarily a disease of vascular smooth muscle cells,
we found no difference in SMC coverage of cortical vessels
in TgNotch3R169C mice compared to age-matched wildtype
littermates (representative brain sections at 12 months
of age are shown in Fig 6A, B). To determine whether the
increased Notch3 accumulation in the TgNotch3R169C
mice is accompanied by a change in capillary morphology
and/or density, we measured the lectin-positive capillary
profiles in the TgNotch3R169C and wild-type mice; we
found no difference between the mouse lines at any age
(representative brain sections at 12 months age are shown
in Fig 6C, D). Lack of age-dependent change in SMC
coverage and capillary density in TgNotch3R169C mice are
respectively seen in Figure 6E and F.
TgNotch3WT transgenic mice were also analyzed
for Notch3 aggregation, SMC coverage, capillary density,
pericyte coverage, and albumin extravasation. Similar
results (data not shown) as for wild-type mice were
obtained. This showed that overexpression itself did not
induce any pathological characteristics.
Morphological Changes in the Cortex Precede
Functional Vascular Impairment in CADASIL Mice
To examine the consequences of pericyte loss at a functional
level, we compared the vascular response to
inhaled CO
2
, a known cerebral vasodilator, in 7- and 12-
month-old TgNotch3R169C mice and their age-matched
wild-type littermates. Inhalation of 10% CO
2
induced an
immediate dilatation of pial arterioles in 7- and 12-
month-old wild-type mice as well as in 7- and 12-
month-old TgNotch3R169C mice (Figs 7 and 8). In parallel
, CBF increased to the same level in 7-month-old
wild-type and TgNotch3R169C mice. In 12-month-old
TgNotch3R169C mice, however, this response was

significantly reduced as indicated by repeated measurements
over time and area under the curve analysis (p <
0.05). Hence, in TgNotch3R169C mice reactive hyperemia
was impaired at an age of 12 months and pericyte
pathology was already present at 7 months of age. This
suggests that pericyte, astrocyte, and BBB pathology precedes
functional vascular impairment in CADASIL mice.
Discussion
Using a mouse model of CADASIL, we report that
mutant Notch3 accumulates in pericytes; moreover, we
report that progressive pericyte loss and BBB leakage in
the cerebral cortex precede the functional impairments in
cerebral vessels. These findings suggest that pericyte dysfunction
and loss occur early in the pathogenesis of
CADASIL, and pericyte dysfunction causes a disruption
of the neurovascular unit and leakage of the BBB (Fig 9).
Consistent with previous studies, we found an agedependent
increase in Notch3 aggregation, but no loss of
SMCs.5 The preservation of SMC integrity in contrast to
pericyte integrity is among the most important findings
of our study. In addition, we found no reduction in capillary
density in TgNotch3R169C mice. However, while
investigating PDGFRb in 12-month-old TgNotch3R169C
mice, we observed a significant reduction in the number
of cortical pericytes, as well as a decrease in pericyte coverage
around the endothelial wall of cortical microvessels,
compared with aged-matched wild-type controls. Moreover
, the age-dependent decrease in pericytes was proportional
to the increase of Notch3 aggregates. These
findings reconfirm previous observations by other groups
that used electron microscopy to detect ultrastructural
changes in pericytes in postmortem tissue samples from
CADASIL patients.17,18 To rule out the possibility that
overexpressing mutant Notch3 merely caused a downregulation
of PDGFRb in well-preserved pericyte processes,
we used a second pericyte-specific marker, desmin, confirming
that pericyte coverage of the microvasculature
decreases with age. In contrast to previous reports using
PDGFRb-knockout mice,9,13 the age-dependent loss of
microvascular pericyte coverage in our CADASIL mouse
model was not accompanied by a decrease in capillary
density or vascular diameter. This difference in results
may be due to the earlier, more severe loss of pericytes in
PDGFRb-knockout mice and may suggest that pericytes
play a more important role in vascular formation during
embryonic development than in microvascular maintenance
in the adult brain.
The reduction in neurovascular pericyte coverage
and the loss of pericytes were correlated with the extent
of BBB breakdown in the cerebral cortex as measured by
the extravasations of 2 intrinsic plasma proteins, albumin
and fibrinogen. In addition, we observed a decrease in
astrocytic end-foot coverage on microvessels; this decrease
was confirmed using GFAP staining. Conformational
changes in the neurovascular unit were also confirmed by
the reorganization of polarized markers of astrocytic endfeet
and by the presence of the characteristic bridges. We
also provide the first evidence that pericytes directly communicate
with astrocytes to maintain the BBB. We found
a significant reduction in the endothelial adherens junction
protein VE-cadherin in TgNotch3R169C mice, but
we found no reduction in the gap junction protein
connexin-43. These results are consistent with reports
that BBB breakdown does not involve a reduction in
connexins.31 Other groups reported the reorganization of
connexin-43 in astrocytic gap junctions but no change in
connexin-43 protein levels in response to injury.32,33
Therefore, connexin-43 may be reorganized in CADASIL
mice, which would correlate nicely with the reorganization
of polarized markers of astrocytic end-feet. Using in
vivo imaging, we also found that cerebral flood flow is
not altered in TgNotch3R169C mice at 7 months of age,
despite significant changes in microvascular morphology
changes at this age. Consistent with previous reports, at
12 months of age, the CO
2
-induced response in CBF
was significantly reduced in TgNotch3R169C mice.5
Experiments on somatosensory stimulation showed no
difference between 7- and 12-month-old CADASIL
mutant mice and respective controls (unpublished data).
Also, our data may suggest a selective dysfunction of pial
versus intraparenchymal arterioles. However, CBF

integrates the response of the whole neurovascular tree.
Therefore, a normal (or even augmented) response of
pial arterioles in CADASIL mutant mice together with a
significantly reduced CBF response clearly points toward
dysfunction of parenchymal arterioles and/or capillaries.
This interpretation is well in line with our findings that
CADASIL mutant mice showed reduced pericyte coverage
and opening of the BBB in intraparenchymal arterioles
and/or capillaries. Taken together, these results
confirm that changes in cortical morphology precede
functional vascular dysfunction in CADASIL.
Our results provide important clues regarding the
mechanisms that underlie the changes in cortical morphology
that occur during the progression of CADASIL.
Specifically, progressive pericyte loss causes progressive
changes in microvascular structure and a disruption in
the BBB. BBB damage has been implicated in many
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease, multiple
sclerosis, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
dementia complex.16 Understanding the mechanisms
underlying BBB dysfunction in such neurological disorders
can reveal therapies designed to reverse and/or
reduce neuronal damage that occurs secondary to or is
accelerated by BBB damage. Here, we show that early
changes in cortical morphology are followed by late
onset vascular functional impairment. Several vascular
defects have been reported to occur in several types of
neurodegenerative disorders; however, whether these
defects are the cause or the consequence of the disease
remains largely unknown.23,33 Consistent with a previous
report in which pericyte loss mediates BBB disruption
and vascular dysfunction precedes neuronal
degeneration in Alzheimer disease,9 we found that pericyte
loss mediates BBB disruption in our CADASIL
mouse model, and this effect precedes functional vascular
impairment. Another important hallmark of CADASIL
is white matter lesions.3,5 The opening of the BBB
and neurovascular dysfunction are features of the disease
that precede white matter damage5 by several months in
this model. This also suggests that BBB permeability
could be an important trigger for white matter lesions
and progression, as also suggested by others.34 Taken
together, these results provide an important clue suggesting
that vascular defects are the cause rather than the
consequence of neurodegenerative diseases, including
CADASIL. Based on these findings, we conclude that
CADASIL is initiated by pericyte dysfunction and disruption
of the BBB, which subsequently may lead to
neuronal dysfunction, eventually giving rise to dementia
and other CADASIL-related symptoms. However, the
precise sequence of events is a matter of debate and
requires further study. Nevertheless, our results open
new avenues for studying other vascular components,
including endothelial cells, the basal membrane, and various
signaling cascades. Finally, aging has a welldocumented
effect on the progression of cerebral smallvessel
disease24,35; consistent with this effect, we found
that aging significantly affects both the onset and course
of CADASIL in our TgNotch3R169C mouse model. So
far CADASIL mutant mice were not evaluated regarding
their behavior because they were generated in the genetic
FVB/N background and behavior is difficult to assess in
these mice due to their well-known hyperactivity and
visual impairments.36
FIGURE 9: Model of microvascular changes in the cortex of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) mice due to the progressive loss of pericytes and astrocytic end-feet. In the CADASIL
mouse model (right), major changes occur in the neurovascular unit. These changes include a significant increase in Notch3
aggregation, significant pericyte loss, reduced pericyte coverage of the vessel, reduced astrocyte polarization, a loss of astrocytic
end-foot coverage, a loss of endothelial junction proteins, and leakage of proteins through the blood–brain barrier. In
contrast, gap junction proteins are not affected.

Therefore, our results suggest that Notch3 accumulation
and the subsequent dysfunction of pericytes are
early steps in the pathogenesis of CADASIL. Therefore,
pericytes may represent a novel therapeutic target in
CADASIL. Moreover, this vascular view of CADASIL
pathogenesis could have profound implications with
respect to our understanding of neurological disorders
and other forms of vascular-related dementia.
