Stroke
Brain injury following stroke affects neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. However, a complete understanding
of the origin and fate of the endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs)in vivois missing. Tools and technology
that allow non-invasive imaging and tracking of eNSCs in living animals will help to overcome this hurdle.
In this study, we aimed to monitor eNSCs in a photothrombotic (PT) stroke model usingin vivobioluminescence
imaging (BLI). In afirst strategy, inducible transgenic mice expressingfirefly luciferase (Fluc) in the eNSCs were
generated. In animals that received stroke, an increased BLI signal originating from the infarct region was observed.
However, due to histological limitations, the identity and exact origin of cells contributing to the increased
BLI signal could not be revealed. To overcome this limitation, we developed an alternative strategy
employing stereotactic injection of conditional lentiviral vectors (Cre-Flex LVs) encoding Fluc and eGFP in the
subventricular zone (SVZ) of Nestin-Cre transgenic mice, thereby specifically labeling the eNSCs. Upon induction
of stroke, increased eNSC proliferation resulted in a significant increase in BLI signal between 2 days and 2 weeks
after stroke, decreasing after 3 months. Additionally, the BLI signal relocalized from the SVZ towards the infarct
region during the 2 weeks following stroke. Histological analysis at 90 days post stroke showed that in the periinfarct
area, 36% of labeled eNSCprogenydifferentiatedinto astrocytes, while 21% differentiatedintomatureneurons.
In conclusion, we developed and validated a novel imaging technique that unequivocally demonstrates that
nestin+eNSCs originating from the SVZ respond to stroke injury by increased proliferation, migration towards
the infarct region and differentiation into both astrocytes and neurons. In addition, this new approach allows
non-invasive and specific monitoring of eNSCs over time, opening perspectives for preclinical evaluation of candidate
stroke therapeutics.

Introduction
The presence of endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs) in the adult
mammalian brain, including human brain, is now widely accepted
(Altman, 1962, 1963; Curtis et al., 2005; Eriksson et al., 1998). Two
brain regions, i.e. the SVZ of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular
zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, are recognized as primary
regions of adult neurogenesis (Ming and Song, 2005). Under physiological
conditions, eNSCs in the SVZ divide and their progeny migrates
tangentially via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory
bulb (OB). Upon arrival in the OB, neuroblasts differentiate into local
interneurons and integrate into the glomerular and granular layers
(Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002). Pathological conditions,
including brain injury and stroke, affect adult neurogenesis (Curtis
et al., 2005; Gray and Sundstrom, 1998; Liu et al., 1998). Stroke, a common
cause of morbidity and mortalityworldwide,deprivesthebrainof
oxygen and glucose (Flynn et al., 2008). Following stroke, neurogenesis
augmentsthenumberofimmatureneuronsintheSVZ( Jin et al., 2001;
Zhang et al., 2008). Neuroblasts (positive for the marker doublecortin,
DCX) migrate towards sites of ischemic damage and upon arrival, phenotypic
markers of mature neurons can be detected (Arvidsson et al., 2002;
Parent et al., 2002). On the other hand, retroviral labeling of the SVZ
showed that cells migrated to the lesion and differentiated into glia
(Goings et al., 2004), demonstrating that following injury, the SVZ can
generate both neural cell types. Some studies showed that SVZ-derived
progenitors can differentiate into medium spiny neurons in the striatum
after stroke (Collin et al., 2005; Parent et al., 2002), whereas others
claimed that the newborn cells are fate restricted to interneurons or
glia (Deierborg et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009). Whether SVZ neural progenitors
can alter their fate, integrate in the injured circuits and survive for
long time periods is still a matter of debate (Kernie and Parent, 2010).
Up till now, specific labeling of eNSCs in the SVZ and the follow-up of
the migration of their progeny to the ischemic area over time has not
yet been shown.
Apart from the primary neurogenic niches, other brain regions, e.g.
the cortex, contain cells that become multipotent and self-renew after
injury (Komitova et al., 2006). Although mature astrocytes do not divide
in healthy conditions, they can dedifferentiate and proliferate after stab
wound injury and stroke (Buffo et al., 2008; Sirko et al., 2013). While
these proliferating astrocytes remained within their lineage in vivo,
they formed multipotent neurospheres in vitro (Buffo et al., 2008;
Shimada et al., 2010). Therefore, these reactive astrocytes may represent
an alternative source of multipotent cells that may be beneficial in stroke.
A major hurdle when studying endogenous neurogenesis is the lack
of methods to monitor these processes in vivo, in individual animals
over time. We and others attempted to label eNSCs by injection of
iron oxide-based particles in the lateral ventricle or SVZ (Nieman
et al., 2010; Shapiro et al., 2006; Sumner et al., 2009; Vreys et al.,
2010), or by lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding a reporter gene into the
SVZ (Vande Velde et al., 2012) to monitor stem cell migration along
the RMS with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although MRI provides
high resolution, it suffers from low in vivo sensitivity and gives
no information on cell viability and non-specific signal detection cannot
be excluded. Rueger et al. describedin vivoimaging of eNSCs after focal
cerebral ischemia via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
(Rueger et al., 2010), however, the cells responsible for the PET signal
could not be identified. Alternatively, transgenic mice expressing Fluc
driven by a DCX promoter allowed monitoring of adult neurogenesis
using in vivoBLI (Couillard-Despres et al., 2008). However, the robust
BLI signal emitted from the SVZ, leading to scattering and projection
of these photons to the OB, impedes direct visualization of eNSC migration
from the SVZ towards the OB. Moreover, when the DCX+
neuroblasts differentiateinto matureneurons, they losetheFluc expression.
In afirst part of the present study, we generated inducible transgenic
mice that express Fluc in the nestin+ eNSCs, to monitor a
stroke-induced eNSC response with BLI.
An alternative strategy to efficiently and stably introduce Fluc in the
eNSCs is by stereotactic injection of LVs into the SVZ, which allowed us
and others to monitor the migration of eNSCs and their progeny
towards the OB with BLI (Guglielmetti et al., 2013; Reumers et al.,
2008). However, since LVs transduce both dividing and post-mitotic
cells, not only eNSCs but also neighboring astrocytes and mature
neurons are labeled after injection of constitutive LVs in the SVZ
(Geraerts et al., 2006). As a result, in line with the data described in
transgenic mice, a high BLI signal emerges from the site of injection
that interferes with the measurement of the migrating cells (Reumers
et al., 2008). To overcome the latter, we developed new conditional
Cre-Flex LVs in a second part of this study. These Cre-Flex LVs incorporate
Cre-lox technology, allowing that Fluc and eGFP are restrictively
expressed in eNSCs after injection in the SVZ of transgenic Nestin-Cre
mice. While numerous research groups have previously described
stroke-induced eNSC behavior (Arvidsson et al., 2002; Parent et al.,
2002), we here report for thefirst time successful in vivoimaging and
characterization of long-term eNSC responses after stroke.
Materials & methods
Animals
Animal studies were performed in accordance with the current ethical
regulations of the KU Leuven. Nestin-CreERT2mice (a kind gift from
Dr. Amelia J. Eisch (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
Dallas, TX) (Lagace et al., 2007)) and B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln/J
(Jax labs stock nr 003771, (Tronche et al., 1999)) were crossbred
with C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J/J (Jax labs, stock nr 000058), creating white
furred albino mice in a C57BL/6 genetic background. White furred inducible
Nestin-CreERT2 mice were crossbred with ROSA26-LoxP-
stop-LoxP(L-S-L)-luciferase transgenic mice (Safran et al., 2003)(Jax
labs, stock nr 005125), indicated as Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice. To induce
Fluc expression, micereceived tamoxifenintraperitoneally (ip) or orally
at180 mg/kg dissolved in 10% EtOH/90% sunflower oil for 5 consecutive
days. BrdU was administered as previously published (Geraerts et al,
2006). For the stroke follow-up, Fluc expression was induced in 11
Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice by oral tamoxifen treatment. Four days
later, the animals were divided into 2 groups: 8 mice received a PT
stroke and 2 mice received a sham treatment; one mouse died during
tamoxifen induction. Three Cre-negative littermates that received a
stroke were added as controls.
White furred B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln/J mice, here referred to as
Nestin-Cre mice, were stereotactically injected with Cre-Flex LV in the
SVZ at the age of 8 weeks. One week after stereotactic injection,
Nestin-Cre mice received a PT stroke (n = 33) or sham treatment
(n = 10). A Cre-negative littermate that received a stroke was added
as control.
Micewere genotyped by PCRusinggenomicDNA and primers previously
described (Lagace et al., 2007).
Lentiviral vector construction and production
We designed a new conditional LV system based on the Cre/loxP
mechanism, here referred to as Cre-Flex (Cre-mediatedflip-excision).
The Cre-Flex LVs carry a reporter cassette encoding eGFP and Fluc
flanked by a pair of mutually exclusive lox sites. The reporter cassette
is activated after Cre recombination (flip-excision,Fig. 3A). For the construction
of the Cre-Flex plasmids, we used the pCHMWS-eGFP plasmid
as a backbone (Geraerts et al., 2006). As illustrated in Fig. 3A, pairs of
heterotypic loxP_loxm2 recombinase target sites were cloned respectively
, upstream and downstream of eGFP using synthetic oligonucleotide
adaptors. To enable efficient recombination, 46-bp spacers were
inserted in between both lox sites. In this plasmid, eGFP was replaced
by the coding sequence for eGFP-T2A-Fluc (Ibrahimi et al., 2009). All
cloning steps were verified by DNA sequencing. Cre-Flex LVs were

generated and produced by the Leuven Viral Vector Core essentially as
described previously (Geraerts et al., 2005; Ibrahimi et al., 2009). Before
the start of thein vivoexperiments, the LV-Cre-Flex was validated in cell
culture (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Lentiviral vector injections
Mice were anesthetized by ip injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg;
Ketalar, Pfizer, Brussels, Belgium) and medetomidin (1 mg/kg; Domitor,
Pfizer), and positioned in a stereotactic head frame (Stoelting, Wood
Dale, Illinois, USA). Using a 30-gauge Hamilton syringe (VWR International
, Haasrode, Belgium), 4 μL of highly concentrated Cre-Flex LV was
injected in the SVZ at a rate of 0.25 μL/min. After injection of 2μL, the needle
was raised slowly over a distance of 1 mm. After injection of the total
volume the needle was left in place for an additional 5 min to allow diffusion
before being slowly redrawn from the brain. SVZ injections were performed
at the following coordinates relative to Bregma: anteroposterior
0.5 mm, lateral−1.5 mm and dorsoventral−3.0–2.0 mm. After surgery,
anesthesia was reversed with an ip injection of atipamezol (0.5 mg/kg;
Antisedan, Orion Pharma, Newbury, Berkshire, UK).
Stroke models
Anesthesia was provided with 2% isoflurane/O
2
gas anesthesia
(Halocarbon Products Corporation, New Jersey, USA) through a facemask.
The PT strokes were induced according to Vandeputte et al.
(2011). Briefly, a vertical incision was made between the right orbit
and the external auditory canal. Next, the scalp and temporalis muscle
were retracted. After intravenous (iv) injection of the photosensitizer
rose Bengal (20 mg/kg; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, USA) through the tail
vein, photoillumination was performed for 5 min. Photoillumination
with green light (wave length, 540 nm; band width, 80 nm) was
achieved using a xenon lamp (model L-4887; Hamamatsu Photonics,
Hamamatsu City, Japan) with heat-absorbing and greenfilters. The irradiation
at intensity 0.68 W/cm2was directed with a 3-mm opticfiber,
the head of which was placed on the sensory motor cortex. Focal activation
of the photosensitive dye resulted in local endothelial cell injury
leading to microvascular thrombosis and circumscribed cortical infarctions
(Watson et al., 1985). Sham-operated animals underwent the
exact same procedure as the animals with a stroke, except for the
5 min photoillumination.
Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was done
using the intraluminal filament technique previously described
(Dirnagl and members of the MCAO-SOP group, 2009), although in
our experiments the MCA was occluded for 20 min.
MR imaging
For MRI data acquisition, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
(Halocarbon) in O
2
(2.5% for induction, 1.5–2% for maintenance). MR
images were acquired using a Bruker Biospec 9.4 Tesla small animal
MR scanner (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany; horizontal bore,
20 cm) using a cross-coil setup consistingofa7.2cmlinearlypolarized
resonator for transmission and a mouse head surface coil for signal reception
as described before (Oosterlinck et al., 2011; Vandeputte et al., 2011).
In brief, the following protocols were used: (a) T
2
maps using a MSME sequence
(10 echoes with 10 ms spacing,first TE = 10 ms, TR = 2000 ms,
16 nterlaced slices of 0.4 mm, 100 μm2 in plane resolution); (b) T
2
-
weighted MRI using a RARE sequence (TE
eff
=71ms,TR=1300ms,
100 μm3isotropic resolution) and (c) high-resolution T
2
*-weighted 3D
FLASH (TR = 100 ms, TE = 12 ms, 100 μm3 isotropic resolution). The
location of the needle tract after stroke was measured with the Bruker
Biospin software Paravision 5.x.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
The mice were imaged in an IVIS 100 system (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA). Anesthesia was induced in an induction chamber
with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at aflow rate of 1 L/min and maintained
in the IVIS with a 1.5% mixture at 0.5 L/min. Before each imaging
session, the mice were injected iv with 126 mg/kgD-luciferin (Promega,
Leiden, the Netherlands) dissolved in PBS (15 mg/mL). Next, they were
positioned in the IVIS and consecutive 1 or 2 min (depending on the experiment
) frames were acquired until the maximum signal was
reached. Data are reported as the totalflux (p/s/cm2/sr) from a specific
region of interest (ROI) of 12.5 mm2.
Ex vivo bioluminescence imaging
Immediately after in vivo BLI imaging, mice were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation, decapitated and the brain was dissected. The
brain was placed in an acrylic brain matrix (Harvard apparatus,
Holliston, MA, USA) and sliced in 1.0 mm-thick sections. Next, these
sections were imaged for 1 min in the IVIS.
Immunohistochemistry
Animals were sacrificed with an ip overdose (15 μL/g) of pentobarbital
(Nembutal, CEVA Santé Animale, Libourne, France) and transcardially
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains
were removed and postfixed for 24 h with PFA. 50 μm thick coronal
sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and incubated overnight
with the primary antibody, rabbit anti-eGFP (made in-house,
1:10000 (Baekelandt et al., 2003)) or a rabbit anti-Cre recombinase
(1:3000 (Lemberger et al., 2007)), in 10% normal swine serum and
0.1% Triton X-100. The sections were then incubated in biotinylated
swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:300; Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark), followed by incubation with streptavidin horseradish
peroxidase complex (Dako). Immune-reactive cells were detected by
3,3′-diaminobenzidine, using H
2
O
2
as a substrate. For 5-bromo-2′-
deoxyuridine (BrdU) detection, sections were pre-treated for 30 min in
2 N HCl at 37 °C, blocked in 0.1 M borate buffer for 20 min, rinsed
3 × 10 min in PBS before incubation with rat anti-BrdU (1:400, Accurate
chemical, NY, USA) in 10% horse serum, followed by incubation with biotinylated
donkey anti-rat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). The number of eGFP+cells was estimated with an unbiased
stereological counting method, by employing the optical fractionator
principle in a computerized system, as described previously (Baekelandt
et al., 2002) (StereoInvestigator, MicroBright-Field, Magdeburg,
Germany).
For immunofluorescent stainings, sections were treated with PBS-
10% horse serum-0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Next, sections were incubated
overnight at 4 °C in PBS–0.1% Triton X-100 with the following
antibodies: chicken anti-eGFP (1:500, Aves labs, Tigard, OR) and rabbit
anti-glialfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astroglial cells and type B
cells (1:500, Dako), goat anti-doublecortin (DCX) for migrating
neuroblasts (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit anti-neuronal
nuclei (NeuN) for mature neurons (1:1000, EnCor Biotechnology Inc.,
Gainesville, FL, USA). The next day, sections were incubated with the
appropriate mixture of the followingfluorescently labeled secondary
antibodies at room temperature for 2 h: donkey anti-chicken (FITC,
1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), donkey anti-goat
(Alexa 555, 1:400, Molecular Probes) or donkey anti-rabbit (Alexa
647, 1:400, Molecular Probes). Next, the sections were washed in PBS-
0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted with Mowiol. Fluorescence was detected
with a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus) with a 488 nm, a
559 nm and a 633 nm laser. The signal from eachfluorochrome was collected
sequentially. For the quantification of double and triple positive
cells, all GFP+cells in the right SVZ, corpus callosum and stroke region
(one section per animal) were analyzed at 40× using z-plane confocal

Results
Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice show an increased BLI signal after stroke
To monitor a stroke-induced eNSC response with BLI we initially
used a transgenic strategy, where Nestin-CreERT2mice were crossbred
with ROSA26-loxP-stop-loxP(L-S-L)-luciferase transgenic mice. In the
resulting Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice, Fluc expression is induced specifically
in the nestin+ eNSCs following administration of tamoxifen
(Lagace et al., 2007). First, we monitored the migration of eNSC progeny
from the SVZ to the OB with BLI in healthy adult Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc
mice. BLI was performed 1 week before and 1, 4, 8, 15 and 20 weeks
after tamoxifen administration in healthy Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice
(n = 5) or Cre-negative littermates (n = 4). At all time points investigated
, no distinctin vivoBLI signals could be detected in the neurogenic
regions of Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice and in Cre-negative littermates
(Figs. 1A–C).Furthermore, there was no significant increase in BLI signal
originatingfrom theOB over timein Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice (Figs. 1B,
C). Although no differences inin vivoBLI signal could bedetected,ex vivo
BLI analysis showed a 2 to 3 fold higher BLI signal in the OB and SVZ of
Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice compared to Cre-negative littermates (Figs. 1
D,E). This indicates thatFluc is indeed expressed in eNSCsof theSVZ and
in the progeny arriving in the OB, as is evidenced byex vivoBLI, but the
number of labeled cells is too low forin vivodetection. The latter might
be explained by a low neurogenic potential in the Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc
Fig. 1.Long-term follow-up of Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice with BLI. (A,B) A long-term follow-up of the BLI signal originating from the neurogenic brain regions was performed in Nestin-
CreERT2/Fluc mice (n = 5) and Cre-negative littermates (n = 4). BLI was performed 1 week before and 1, 4, 8, 15 and 20 weeks after ip administration of tamoxifen. The BLI signal
originating from the SVZ (A) and OB (B) was not significantly different from the background signal in Cre-negative littermates. Furthermore, no increase in BLI signal originating from
the OB was detected over time (B). (C) BLI images of a representative Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mouse 1 week before and 4, 8 and 15 weeks after tamoxifen administration. (D) Ex vivoBLI

mice, since differences in neurogenic potential between mouse strains
have been described (Kempermann et al., 1997). Therefore, we evaluated
the neurogenic potential in Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice and in agematched
C57BL/6 mice using BrdU (Supplementary Fig. 2) and showed
that proliferation in the SVZ and number of newborn neurons arriving
in the OB was not different. In conclusion, neurogenesis in SVZ and migration
to the OB could not be monitored with in vivo BLI in healthy
adult Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice.
Next, we investigated whether stroke-induced neurogenesis could
be monitored in Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice. Nine days after tamoxifen
administration, mice either received a PT stroke in the right sensorimotor
cortex (n = 8) or a sham treatment (n = 2) (Fig. 2A). Cre-negative
littermates with stroke were included as controls (n = 3). BLI was
performed one day prior to and 7, 15, 22 and 33 days after surgery. In
Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice receiving sham treatment and in Crenegative
littermates receiving stroke, no in vivo BLI signal could be
detected (Figs. 2B,C). However, in 6 out of 8 Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice
that received a stroke, a distinct BLI signal emerging from the stroke
area was detected starting at day 7 (Figs. 2B,C), compared to the baseline
scan before surgery, being 3.2 ± 0.4 fold higher at 7 days
(p b 0.001), 4.2 ± 0.5 fold higher at 15 days (p b 0.001), 2.1 ± 0.4
fold higher at 22 days (p b 0.05) and 1.9 ± 0.3 fold higher at 33 days
(not significant) after surgery (Fig. 2B). Ex vivo analysis was performed
after 33 days and demonstrated in 3 out of 6 animals a BLI signal emerging
from the stroke region, corroborating thein vivomeasurements and
excluding that the signal originated from the skin (Fig. 2D). Although
the BLI signal emerging from the stroke area could result from accumulation
of migrating SVZ progeny, alternatively, mature astrocytes in the
infarction zone might have dedifferentiated upon injury, resulting in
nestin and subsequent Fluc activity (Buffoetal.,2008 ). Thus, although
a stroke-induced neurogenic response can be detected with in vivoBLI
in Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice, the exact origin of the BLI signal could
not be identified.
Development and validation of conditional Cre-Flex LVs for specific eNSC
labeling
To overcome this limitation, we engineered a viral vector-based
system, containing a Cre-Flex cassette. The LV encodes a reporter cassette
, here encoding eGFP and Fluc linked by a peptide 2A sequence,
in reverse orientation relative to the promoter, that is only activated
in cells expressing Cre recombinase (LV-Cre-Flex Nb eGFP-T2A-Fluc;
Fig. 3A). We injected LV-Cre-Flex Nb eGFP-T2A-Fluc into Nestin-Cre
transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of
the rat nestin promoter and enhancer, limiting Cre expression to
eNSCs. As a result, eGFP and Fluc expression is specifically activated in
eNSCs and their progeny. The use of 2A-like peptides results in equimolar
expression of Fluc and eGFP reporter genes (Ibrahimi et al., 2009),
enabling BLI and immunohistochemistry for eGFP to identify transduced
cells in the same animal.
The LVs were injected in the SVZ of healthy adult Nestin-Cre mice
(n = 9) to label the eNSCs and the migration of the progeny to the OB
was monitored by BLI at 1, 8, 15, 20 and 27 weeks after injection (Figs.
3B,C). Inlinewithearlier data(Reumers et al., 2008),a distinct BLI signal
emerged from the OB at 8 weeks, which gradually increased over time
being 3.2 ± 0.3 fold higher at 8 weeks (not significant), 4.3 ± 0.8 fold
higher at 15 weeks (p b 0.01), 5.1 ± 1.1 fold higher at 20 weeks
(p b 0.001) and 5.5 ± 1.4fold higher at27 weeks (pb 0.001)compared
to 1 week after injection (Figs. 3B,C). No BLI signal from the OB could be
identified in WT mice 1 or 15 weeks after injection of the Cre-Flex LV
(n = 4) (Figs. 3B, C). Immunohistochemical detection of Cre+ and
eGFP+ cells showed specific labeling of cells lining the ventricle wall
and labeled eNSC progeny in the OB (Figs. 3D–E–F, respectively). In conclusion
, the conditional LV-based labeling system combines specificand
efficient labeling of the eNSC population of the SVZ with the possibility
for immunohistochemical analysis of the transduced eNSCs and their
progeny. Additionally, migration of the eNSC progeny to the OB could

be monitored in vivo with BLI, which was not feasible in the Nestin-
CreERT2/Fluc mice.
Stroke-induced neurogenic response in the SVZ is detected by BLI and
histology
Cre-Flex LVs were applied to monitor the eNSC response after stroke
(Fig. 4A). Adult Nestin-Cre mice were stereotactically injected with LVCre-Flex Nb eGFP-T2A-Fluc into the right side of the SVZ. Seven days
post injection, the animals received either a PT stroke in the right sensorimotor
cortex (n = 21) or sham surgery (n = 9). Stroke lesions were
monitored with MRI 2, 7 and 14 days after surgery (Fig. 4C). BLI
measurements were performed 1 day before (baseline) and 2, 7, 14,
30 and 90 days after surgery (Figs. 4A,B,D). As a control, a Crenegative
mouse was injected with the LV-Cre-Flex vector and received
a PT stroke. It was monitored until 3 months after stroke, but no BLI
signal could be detected (data not shown). At all time points investigated
, the sham animals showed no difference in BLI signal compared to
the baseline scan (Fig. 4D). However, mice with a PT stroke showed a
4.3 ± 0.8 fold increase in BLI signal at 2 days (p b 0.001), a 6.2 ± 1.6
fold increase at 7 days (p b 0.01), a 7.5 ± 3.3 fold increase at 14 days
(p b 0.05) and a 6.4 ± 3.5 fold increase at 30 days (not significant)
(Fig. 4D). At later time points, the stroke BLI signal decreased until
90 days after stroke.
The stroke-induced increase in BLI signal was corroborated by stereological
quantification of the number of eGFP+cells in the SVZ, striatum
,corpus callosum(CC) and peri-infarct area (Figs. 5A,B). Most eGFP+
cells were detected in the CC, reaching to the stroke area. In sham animals
, 2116 ± 209 eGFP+cells (n = 7) were counted and this number
did not change over time. In animals receiving stroke surgery, the number
of eGFP+ cells was significantly higher at 2 days (4123 ± 674,
p b 0.05, n = 7), 7 days (5407 ± 290, p b 0.05, n = 2) and 14 days
(4610 ± 222, pb 0.05, n = 4) after stroke, compared to sham animals
(Fig. 5B). 90 days after stroke, the number of eGFP+ cells decreased
and was significantly lower (2382 ± 375, p b 0.05, n = 7) compared
to 7 and 14 days after stroke, corroborating the results obtained by BLI.
To ensure that the eGFP+cells originate from labeled eNSCs and not
from reactive astrocytes that upregulate their nestin promoter and thus
Cre upon injury, Cre expression was analyzed 2 days after stroke
(Supplementary Figs. 3A,B). There was no Cre upregulation in the ipsilateral
SVZ and CC compared to the contralateral hemisphere (Supplementary
Fig. 3A), whereas Cre-positive cells with astrocyte-like morphology
were detected in close proximity of the stroke lesion (Supplementary
Fig. 3B). These cells were mainly present in the cortex on the dorsal
side of the lesion and to a lesser extent on the lateral side of the lesion.
Since the Cre-Flex LVs were injected in the SVZ, which is physically distant
from the stroke region, and since the Cre-Flex LVs specifically label
cells in the SVZ (Fig. 3E), it is unlikely that these distant reactive astrocytes
were labeled directly via viral vector injection. Taken together,

(closed arrowheads) and one pair of loxm2 sites (open arrowheads). In the presence of Cre recombinase, the DNA sequence between opposing sites is inversed (Flip), resulting in the
positioning of two homotypic sites in the same orientation. The DNA sequence that isflanked by similarly oriented sites is excised (Excision). Cre-mediated inversion can start at the
loxP or the loxm2 sites, but will always result in the samefinal product after Cre-mediated excision. The end product is an inverted DNA sequence,flanked by two heterotypic sites
that cannot recombine with one another thereby preventing further inversions. (B) Cre-Flex Nb eGFP-T2A-Fluc LV were injected in the SVZ of black furred Nestin-Cre mice (n = 9) or

the Cre-Flex LV allowed non-invasive monitoring of a stroke-induced
transient increase in the number of eGFP+cells, which originated from
labeled eNSCs in the SVZ.
In vivo BLI reveals eNSC migration to the area of infarction and OB following
PT stroke
Long-term BLI follow-up of stroke animals not only revealed a transient
increase in BLI signal, but also a clear shift of the BLI signal towards
the stroke lesion was apparent (Fig. 4B). To estimate the migration of
the BLI signal after stroke, the distance between the BLI hot spot and
the midline was determined (Fig. 4E). Before stroke surgery, a unifocal
signal originating from the site of injection was detected, which corresponds
to labeled cells in the SVZ (average distance of 2.56 ±
0.22 mm from midline). Two days after stroke, a small shift of the BLI
signal towards the contralateral hemisphere was evident (Fig. 4B),
probably due to the induction of edema as was detected by MRI (Supplementary
Fig. 4A). At 1 and 2 weeks after stroke, a significant shift
of the BLI spot towards the stroke region was observed in 9 out of 10 animals
(average distance of 4.62 ± 0.25 mm from midline, p b 0.001
compared to baseline) (Figs. 4B,E), suggesting migration of the eNSC
progeny towards the stroke area. In the sham-operated animals no
shift was detected at any of the time points (data not shown). Since dynamic
changes of edema or changes in ventricle size due to lossof viable
brain tissue might affect the location of the BLI signal, the animals were
also imaged with MRI on the same day of the BLI (Fig. 4A). The needle
tract was used as a reference and its shift due to edema formation or
changes in ventricle size was monitored (Supplementary Figs. 4A,B).
The needle tract shift 14 days after stroke compared to the time of injection
was 0.39 ± 0.04 mm (n = 9), which was considerably smaller than
the shift of the BLI signal (2.06 mm). Although a small enlargement of
the ventricles was detected in the animals with a PT stroke, its effect
on the migration of BLI signal was limited.
Since most studies have investigated stroke-induced neurogenesis
in models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Parent et al.,
2002; Thored et al., 2007), a small experiment where animals received
either MCAO (n = 4) or sham surgery (n = 3) was performed (Supplementary
Fig. 5). The MCAO model provides MCA territory infarctions,
involving the striatum and the frontoparietal cortex, after the insertion
of a monofilament that blocks the origin of MCA, whereas the PT stroke
model involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitive dye
followed by laser irradiation of any exposed region of the skull.

Although a 5 fold increase in BLIsignal wasdetected over timein the animal
with the largest MCAO stroke lesion, there was no re-location of
the BLI signal, most likely due to the large stroke size and its location,
whichrestrainsthemigration and localization of thelabeled cells within
a region of the ischemic striatum (Ohab and Carmichael, 2008).
In the group receiving PT stroke, long-term BLI follow-up revealed a
clear BLI signal between the eyes in 5 out of 8 animals at 3 months after
stroke, in line with migration of eNSC progeny to the OB (Fig. 4B). The
origin of BLI signal emerging from the OB was corroborated histologically
by a gradual increase in the number of eGFP+cells in the OB over time,
being 2.7 ± 0.6 fold higher at 14 days (not significant) and 12.8 ± 2.0
fold higher (pb 0.05) at90 days compared to 7 days after stroke surgery
(Figs. 5C,D). These results provide additional evidence that the LV-Cre-
Flex specifically labeled the eNSCs in the SVZ.
In conclusion, injection of LV-Cre-Flex in the SVZ of Nestin-Cre mice
allowed monitoring both the migration of eNSC progeny from the SVZ
to the stroke region and to the OB with BLI.
eNSC progeny differentiates into astrocytes and neurons in the peri-infarct
region
Since injection of LV-Cre-Flex in Nestin-Cre mice results in the
expression of Fluc and eGFP in the eNSCs and their progeny, a detailed
histological analysis of the transduced cell population and its progeny
can be performed. In animals killed 90 days after PT stroke, lightproducing
cells (152 ± 30 eGFP+ cells counted per animal, n = 3) were
identified by double and triple immunofluorescence stainings (eGFP in
combination with GFAP or DCX and NeuN (Fig. 6)). In the SVZ and the
CC, 77 ± 7% of eGFP+ cells were GFAP+ eNSCs and astrocytes, 8 ± 2%
were DCX+ migrating neuroblasts and b1% were NeuN+ mature
neurons (Figs. 6A,C,E). A different pattern of cellular phenotypes was
detected in the peri-infarct region: 36 ± 5% of eGFP+ cells were
GFAP+ astrocytes, 13 ± 11% were DCX+ migrating neuroblasts, 5 ±
3% were DCX+NeuN+ immature neurons and 21 ± 16% were NeuN+
mature neurons (Figs. 6B,D,E). Evaluation of differentiation into mature
neurons, displayed a high inter-animal variability, with one animal
showing 50% of eGFP+ cells co-expressing NeuN in the peri-infarct
region, while the other two animals showed less than 10% coexpression.
In thefirst animal, some eGFP+neurons showed long dendrites
covered with many spines (Fig. 6F). These data indicate that the
labeled eNSCs in the SVZ gave rise to progeny that migrated towards
the stroke region where they eventually differentiated into both astrocytes
and mature neurons.
Discussion
Detailed knowledge of the biological role and potential of eNSCs is of
great importance for the success of neuro-regenerative therapies in different
neurological disorders, including stroke. Therefore, development
of non-invasive methods to monitor and study proliferation, migration
and survival of eNSCs and their progeny in the same animal over time
is crucial. The main advantage of cell trackingviaBLI is thehigh sensitivity
, especially when cells are located in superficial tissues (Massoud and
Gambhir, 2003). The present study demonstrates non-invasive imaging
of the eNSC response after PT stroke in a mouse model using BLI. First,
we generated double transgenic Nestin-CreERT2/Fluc mice, in which
Fluc expression is induced in the eNSCs after tamoxifen administration.
After stroke, these mice showed an increase in BLI signal in vivo (n =
6/8) and ex vivo(n = 3/8) originating from the stroke lesion (Figs. 2B,
C). The discrepancy in efficiency between thein vivoandex vivoresults

area is most pronounced at 14 days and 3 months after surgery. Magnifications of specific details are integrated in thefigure. (B) Stereological quantification of the total number of
eGFP+cells in the SVZ, CC, striatum and stroke area after PT stroke. In sham animals, the number of eGFP+cells was constant over time and on average 2116 ± 210 eGFP+cells were
detected (n = 7). In stroke animals, the number of eGFP+cells was significantly higher at 2 days (4123 ± 674, n = 7), 7 days (5407 ± 290, n = 2) and 14 days (4610 ± 222, n = 4)
after stroke, compared to sham animals (One-way ANOVA pb 0.001, followed by Bonferroni post test pb 0.05, indicated by $). 90 days after stroke, the number of eGFP+cells was significantly lower (2382 ± 375, n = 7, Bonferroni post test pb 0.05, indicated by #) compared to 7 and 14 days after stroke. (C) Representative immunohistochemical images of eGFP+cells

followed by Dunn's post test pb 0.05). The time-dependent increase corresponds to the migration of eGFP+eNSC progeny from the SVZ to the OB.

can be explained by technical issues, suchas the timerequired to dissect
the brain tissue immediately after sacrifice, which causes differences in
oxygenation status of the tissue and enzymatic activity (Deroose et al.,
2006). In the latter model it was impossible to define the origin of the
cells giving rise to the BLI signal emerging from the stroke area, which
might either originate from accumulation of migrating SVZ progeny or
from dedifferentiation of local mature astrocytes upon injury, resulting
in nestin and subsequently, Fluc expression (Buffo et al., 2008). Moreover
, although Fluc is expressed in eNSCs of the SVZ and eventually in
the progeny arriving in the OB, as was evidenced by ex vivo BLI (Figs.
1D, E), the number of labeled cells or the expression level of Fluc per
cell was too low forin vivodetection (Figs. 1A–C). In this way, the effect
of stroke on the neurogenic process towards the OB could also not be
monitored.
In a secondapproach,we circumvented thesedrawbacks by devising
conditional Cre-Flex LVs to inject in the SVZ of Nestin-Cre mice. Specific
induction of Fluc and eGFP in the eNSCs and their progeny allows both
BLI and immunohistochemical characterization of the neurogenic process.
In contrast to the first approach using double transgenic mice,
in vivoBLI signals from the SVZ and eventually from the OB could be detected
(Fig. 3C), most probably due to the higher Fluc expression levels.
Induction of a PT stroke resulted in a significant gradual increase in BLI
signal between 2 days and 2 weeks after surgery (Figs. 4B,D). The latter
was underscored by an increase in eGFP+cells in the SVZ, striatum, CC
and stroke region (Fig. 5B). Subsequently, the BLI signal and the number
of eGFP+cells decreased to background levels at 3 months after stroke.
This transient increase in eNSC progeny is in accordance with two studies
describing a transient increase in the proliferation and migration of
eNSCs following stroke or brain trauma, detected by histology using
cell type-specificmarkers( Parent et al., 2002) or by retroviral labeling
of SVZ cells (Goings et al., 2004). Parent et al. showed that the number
of BrdU-labeled cells was lower 5 weeks after stroke compared to previous
time points, suggesting that many of the newly generated cells
died (Parent et al., 2002).
In Nestin-Cre mice injected with the Cre-Flex LV, a clear
relocalization of the BLI signal towards the stroke area was detected
between 1 and 2 weeks after stroke surgery. This was confirmed histologically
by eGFP+cells moving closer towards the ischemic lesion over
time (Figs. 4Band5A). The 1–2 weeks time frame of this migration is in
agreement with the work of Ohab et al. who detected GFP+cells, originating
from the SVZ, in the peri-infarct cortex 7 and 14 days after stroke
(Ohab et al., 2006). When monitoring eNSC migration after stroke with
BLI, we encountered some technical hurdles. First, edema formation
causes a shift of the midline, resulting in a slight apparent re-location
of the BLI spot towards the contralateral hemisphere, complicating
detection of eNSC migration towards the lesion at early time points.
Second, changes in ventricle size, due to tissue degeneration after stroke
may confound the imaging results (Karki et al., 2010). Therefore, we
combined BLI with MRI, which has a high spatial resolution and gives
better insight in alterations of the anatomical structure of the brain.
Since labeled cells express afluorescent reporter (eGFP) in addition
to the bioluminescentFluc reporter, theorigin and identityof light emitting
cells could be determined by immunohistochemical stainings.
Ninety days after stroke, labeled eNSC progeny differentiated into
both astrocytes and mature neurons, demonstrating the multipotency
of eNSCs upon stroke injury (Arvidsson et al., 2002; Goings et al.,
2004; Parent et al., 2002). The majority of eGFP+ labeled cells in the
SVZ, CC and the stroke region expressed GFAP, corroborating astrocytic
differentiation of eNSC progeny after cortical injury (Goings et al., 2004;
Holmin et al., 1997). In addition, using tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-
CreERT2:R26R-YFP reporter mice, Li et al. demonstrated that 45% of
eNSC progeny co-expressed GFAP 6 weeks after MCAO, indicating a
significant gliogenic component (Li et al., 2010).
Since stroke injury might induce nestin expression in reactive astrocytes
(Buffo et al., 2008; Shimada et al., 2010; Sirko et al., 2013)orin
vasculature-associated cells in the ischemic core (Shin et al., 2013),
one could question the source of the eGFP+ cells located around the
ischemic lesion. However, it has been well described that reactive
astrocytes are mainly present in the close vicinity of the stroke region.
Unbiased stereological quantifications of astrocyte proliferation, a hallmark
of reactive gliosis, showed that astrocytes respond to stroke injury
in a spatially graded way (Barreto et al., 2011). The authors showed that
most astrocyte proliferation occurs within 200 μm of the edge of the
infarct. In addition, nestin upregulation of reactive astrocytes has been
shown to be confined to the peri-infarct region, or to clearly demarcate
the lesion boundary (Li and Chopp, 1999; Shimada et al., 2010). Since
we injected the Cre-Flex LV in the SVZ, which is physically distant
from the stroke region, and since we did not detect any changes in Cre
expression in the SVZ or CC, we consider it unlikely to label local reactive
astrocytes around the stroke region. Another indication that argues
against local reactive astrocytes as the main origin of labeled cells concerns
the localization of the BLI signal: if the 4.3 fold increase in BLI signal
two days after stroke would be caused by labeling of reactive
astrocytes, one would expect appearance of a new BLI spot emerging
from the stroke region, or a shift of the existing SVZ BLI spot towards
the stroke region. However, we show that this is not the case and that
there is even a small shift of the original SVZ BLI spot towards the contralateral
side (Fig. 4B). A clear migration of the BLI spot towards the
stroke region was only apparent after 7–14 days after stroke. Our data
strongly suggest migration of the progeny of transduced eNSCs viathe
CC to the stroke lesion. The increase in BLI signal between the eyes
and the corresponding increase in the number of eGFP+ cells in the
OB over time, points to the migration of labeled eNSC progeny from
the SVZ to the OB, proving that the eNSCs in the SVZ were labeled by
the Cre-Flex LV. Several research groups have shown a reduction or
diversion of normal neuroblast migration from the SVZ to the OB at
early time points after cortical lesion or stroke (Goings et al., 2004;
Ohab et al., 2006). The Cre-Flex LV technology will allow longitudinal
non-invasive imaging of the effects of brain lesions on rostral migration.
The present study focuses on the response of SVZ-derived Nestin+
eNSCs on stroke injury. However, none of the eNSC markers currently
available exclusively labels eNSCs and evidence emerges suggesting
eNSC heterogeneity both in the SVZ (Giachino et al., 2013) and the
SGZ (Bonaguidi et al., 2012; DeCarolis et al., 2013). It would therefore
be interesting to apply the Cre-Flex LVs in different transgenic mice to
compare the contribution of different progenitor populations to the
stroke-induced neurogenic response (Dhaliwal and Lagace, 2011). In
addition, the Cre-Flex LVs might also be used to study eNSC response
in other disease models (Guglielmetti et al., 2013).
In conclusion, we developed a novel technique based on conditional
Cre-Flex LVs that allows non-invasive imaging of the stroke-induced
eNSC response in living mice with BLI. In addition, this new technique
enables fate mappingof the eNSC progenyafter stroke by immunohistochemistry.
Our BLI and histological data are consistent with the prevailing
hypothesis that stroke induces a transient increase in proliferation
in the SVZ, a targeted migration of eNSC progeny towards the stroke region
and differentiation in both astrocytes and neurons. For this reason,
we believe that this technology may facilitate preclinical validation of
neuro-regenerative strategies in rodent stroke models.
