Abstract Ischemic stroke remains a significant problem
that is the major cause of death and disability worldwide.
Parecoxib is clinically used for short-term management of
postoperative pain. Administration of parecoxib in rats has
been reported to protect against the cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of
parecoxib is still largely unknown. In this study, we found
parecoxib could protect against neurotoxicity induced by
4 h oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) plus reoxgenation
for 20 h, a widely used in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion.
In addition, we characterized the molecular
mechanism of parecoxib’s neuroprotection. We found
parecoxib was able to activate CREB, and subsequently
maintained the expression of Bcl-2, which is an important
mitochondria-associated protein. Inhibition of endogenous
Bcl-2 expression by transfection of Bcl-2-shRNA significantly
attenuated the neuroprotective effects of parecoxib
treatment. Furthermore, ATP production assay and
mitochondrial membrane potential (DWm) assay suggested
that parecoxib exerted neuroprotective effect against OGD/
R by maintaining the function of mitochondria. These data
suggested that parecoxib treatment is a potential therapeutic
approach for protecting against ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the common cause of mortality and
disability worldwide. Although great efforts have been
made in the past decades, the therapeutic methods for patients
with ischemic stroke remain limited [1]. Until now,
only one pharmacological agent, named recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rtPA), has been approved by US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute ischemic
stroke by breaking down the occluding clot in cerebral
vessels and restoring blood flow to the ischemic brain [2].
However, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion can often result in
inflammation by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines
including interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factora (TNF-a) and cause secondary damage [3]. Therefore, the
anti-inflammatory agents are potentially useful for protecting
against the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme that mediates
inflammatory process through protaglandins release and
inhibition of COX-2 thereby relieves inflammation and
pain [4]. Parecoxib, a novel potent and selective COX-2
inhibitor, has been widely used for short-term management
of postoperative pain in clinical parctice. Clinical trials

have indicated that parecoxib is effective and well tolerated
for treatment of postoperative pain after dental surgery,
orthopedic surgery [5]. Due to the anti-inflammatory
property, the neuroprotective effect of parecoxib had been
studied previously. An earlier study reported that parecoxib
is neuroprotective in spontaneously hypertensive rats after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, which is closely
related to the inflammation inhibition [6]. Another study
found that pre-treatment with intravenous parecoxib protects
against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and
the neuroprotective effects is probably associated with the
inhibition of inflammatory reaction [7]. Moreover, our
previous study suggested that parecoxib plays neuroprotective
role by attenuating postischemic neuronal apoptosis
, which mediated by activation of Akt and GSK-3b
signaling pathway [8]. However, the underlying neuroprotective
mechanisms of parecoxib against cerebral ischemia
/reperfusion injury still remain largely unknown.
Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) is a classical in vitro
model of ischemia, which has been frequently used for mimicking
the interruption of the blood supply including oxygen
and nutrients to the brain using primary neuronal cultures [9]. In
this study, we aimed to investigate the role of parecoxib in the
protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury using
OGD plus reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. We found that
parecoxib treatment was capable of protecting against OGD/R-
induced neuronal injury in mouse primary cortical neurons.
Moreover, we found parecoxib could induce the activation of
CREB and the expression of Bcl-2,which is responsible for the
neuroprotective effect of parecoxib. Importantly, Bcl-2 protein
had been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effect by
maintaining the function of mitochondria [10], we thus examined
the role of Bcl-2 in parecoxib’s neuroprotection against
OGD/R-induced mitochondria injury. Our results suggested
that the neuroprotective effect of parecoxib was closely associated
with the functional recovery of mitochondria. The results
of present study suggested that parecoxib treatment is potentially
a therapeutic approach for intervention of ischemia/
reperfusion injury.
Materials and Methods
All animal procedures were carried out following protocols
approved by the Ethic Committee of the Xiangya Hosipital
of Central South University.
Materials
Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM),
Neurobasal medium (NBM), glutamine, B27 supplements,
LipofectamineTM 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen.
Fetal bovine serum and 0.05 % trypsin–EDTA were purchased
from Gibco. Antibodies against Akt, phospho-
Ser473-Akt (p-Akt), CREB, phospho-Ser133-CREB (p-
CREB), caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3 and Bcl-2 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies
against NeuN and GFAP were purchased from Abcam. bactin
antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Primary Mouse Cortical Neuron Culture
Primary mouse cortical neuron cultures were established
from C57 BL/6 mouse embryos using methods described
before [11]. Briefly, primary mouse cortical neurons were
isolated from 15 day mouse embryonic cortex. Dissociated
neurons were seeded into 6 or 24-well plates, and maintained
in NBM containing 0.3 mM glutamine and 3 % B27
supplements. The NBM was half changed with fresh NBM
each 3–4 days.
Bcl-2 Knockdown Using Bcl-2-shRNA
Bcl-2-shRNA and scrambled shRNA (control shRNA)
were inserted in pGFP-V-RS retroviral vector, respectively.
The vectors were then transfected into primary cortical
neurons according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Ori-
Gene). Briefly, for 3 9 105 cells, 1 lg of Bcl-2-shRNA or
control shRNA vector was pre-mixed with 3 lL of TurboFectin
solution for 30 min, and the mixture was added
into NBM of neurons for incubation in a 5 % CO
2
incubator
for another 48 h.
Oxygen–Glucose Deprivation (OGD) Plus
Reoxygenation
The NBM of days 8 of primary neuron cultures was replaced
by serum free DMEM, and the cells were then put in
a modular chamber (Billups–Rothenber) perfused with

for 4 h at 37C. Following
OGD, cells were transferred into the incubator for reoxygenation
for 4 h, then treated with parecoxib and followed
by reoxygenation for another 16 h (The total reoxygenation
time is 20 h). The control group were underwent media
change, but were not exposed to OGD and reoxygenation.
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay
After 4 h OGD plus 20 h reoxygenation, LDH assay was
performed to measure neurotoxicity using the LDH detection
kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Roche). The LDH activity in the untreated normal cell
culture medium was detected as ‘‘low control’’, and the
LDH activity released from the untreated control neurons
was determined as ‘‘high control’’ when the neurons were

treated with 0.5 % Triton X-100. To determine the percentage
of neurotoxicity, the resulting values are substituted
in the following equation: Neurotoxicity
(%) = (experimental value - low control)/(high control - low control) 9 100.
MTT Assay
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay was performed to detect cell viability.
Briefly, cells were treated with MTT which was dissolved
in DMEM at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and incubated
at 37C for 4 h. Supernatant was removed and replaced
with 100 ll of DMSO. The optical density (OD)
was recorded on the microplate reader (Lifecare Medical)
at 570 nm. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of
the control value.
Western Blot
Cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology). Equal amounts of proteins from neurons
were subjected to 4–12 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
to PVDF membranes. The blot was blocked with 5 % nonfat
dried milk, incubated overnight at 4C with mouse
primary antibody. Then, incubation was followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary
antibodies. Immunolabeling was performed using enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech
) following manufacturer’s instruction, and then
exposed to film (Eastman Kodak Co.).
ATP Production Assay
ATP production assay was performed to determine the
intracellular ATP levels in mouse primary cortical neurons
using ATP Bioluminescence assay kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). After treatment, neurons
were lysed with 50 lL cell lysis buffer and shaked for
2 min to ensure completely release of ATP. 5 lL cell
lysates were used for protein concentration measurement,
the rest of the cell lysates were added with 100 lL luciferase
reagent. Then the luminescence was measured by
VeritasTM Microplate Luminometer (Turner BioSystems).
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Mitochondrial membrane potential (DWm) was measured
using JC-1 (5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine
iodide) mitochondrial membrane
potential assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Cell Technology). After 4 h OGD plus reoxygenation
for 20 h, the culture neurons were incubated
with 5 lM JC-1 for 20 min at 37C in the incubator. The
flurescent signals of DWm with excitation 545 nm and
emission 620 nm were read with the microplate reader
(Lifecare Medical).
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance
was determined by a one-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey–Kramer tests. P value \0.05 was considered
significant. At least three independent experiments were
performed.
Results
Parecoxib Protects Against OGD/R-Induced
Neuronal Cell Death
To investigate the effect of parecoxib on OGD/R-induced
neuronal cell death in cultured primary cortical neurons,
the MTT assay was used. Consistent with previous study
[12], OGD4 h/R20 h induced a striking increase in cell
death, whereas treatment with parecoxib at 4 h of reoxgenation
after OGD 4 h resulted in a significantly improvement
in the survival rate of neurons, in a dosedependent
manner (Fig. 1a). Similarly, in LDH assay,
OGD/R largely increased LDH release, but treatment with
parecoxib significantly decreased LDH release, thereby
indicating that parecoxib can attenuate OGD/R-induced
neuronal damage (Fig. 1b).
Parecoxib Attenuated OGD/R-Induced Cleavage
of Caspase-3
Caspase-3 is a pro-apoptotic protein that is usually used as
the maker for cell apoptosis [13, 14]. To investigate the
effect of parecoxib on the OGD/R-induced activation of
caspase-3, western blot was performed. The results showed
that OGD/R significantly increased the cleavage of caspase-3
, whereas treatment with parecoxib significantly
decreased OGD/R-induced the expression of cleaved caspase-3
when compared with control group, indicating that
parecoxib was capable of inhibiting OGD/R-induced neuronal
apoptosis (Fig. 2).
Parecoxib Significantly Increases CREB
Phosphorylation and Bcl-2 Expression
Our previous study indicated that parecoxib was able to
increase the expression of Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt) [8],
and Akt/CREB signaling played an important role in protecting
against ischemia/reperfusion injury [15], the effect

of parecoxib on the p-Akt, p-CREB and a CREB target
Bcl-2 protein were detected. As expected, the results
showed that parecoxib significantly increased the expression
levels of p-Akt, p-CREB and Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3).
Parecoxib Partially Rescued the Inhibitory Effect
of OGD/R on CREB Phosphorylation and Bcl-2
Expression
OGD/R had been demonstrated to inhibit CREB phosphorylation
and Bcl-2 expression [16]. To investigate the
role of parecoxib in OGD/R mediated inhibition of CREB
phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression, mouse primary
cortical neurons were suffered from OGD for 4 h, and incubated
with or without parecoxib at 4 h of reoxygenation,
followed by reoxgenation for another 16 h. As previously
shown, OGD/R resulted in the downregulation of CREB
phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression, whereas treatment
of parecoxib significantly rescued the inhibitory effect of
OGD/R on CREB phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression
(Fig. 4). Therefore, these data implied that Bcl-2 is of
significant importance for the neuroprotection role of
parecoxib against OGD/R.
Parecoxib Inhibited OGD/R-Induced Neuronal
Injury by Upregulating Bcl-2 Expression
To further investigate the effect of Bcl-2 knockdown on the
neuroprotective role of parecoxib, Bcl-2-shRNA was
transfected into primary cortical neurons. Western blot
showed that transfection of Bcl-2-shRNA, but not controlshRNA
, led to markedly reduction of Bcl-2 protein expression
in primary cortical neurons (Fig. 5a). In LDH

assay, we found that inhibition of endogenous Bcl-2 expression
by specific Bcl-2 shRNA in primary cortical
neurons significantly attenuated the role of parecoxib
against OGD/R-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 5b). Similar
results were also found in MTT assay, transfection with
Bcl-2-shRNA significantly inhibited the neuroprotective
effect of parecoxib (Fig. 5c). Therefore, these results suggested
that parecoxib inhibited OGD/R-induced neuronal
injury at least in part through a mechanism involving increased
Bcl-2 expression.
Parecoxib Inhibited OGD/R-Induced Mitochondrial
Dysfunction
Bcl-2 is a mitochondira-related protein that protects against
neuronal cell death by maintaining the function of mitochondria
[17, 18], suggesting that parecoxib’s role in
neuroprotection may be related to the maintenance of mitochondria.
To investigate whether parecoxib’s neuroprotection
against OGD/R was accompanied by the
improvement of mitochondrial function, mitochondrial
membrane potential (DWm) was measured using JC-1
reagents. As expected, DWm value was largely decreased
by OGD/R compared to normal neurons, while the reduction
was significantly rescued by parecoxib (Fig. 6a). In
addition, intracellular ATP levels in neurons were also
detected, as it’s another functional marker of mitochondria.
Our results showed that intracellular ATP levels in neurons
were significantly decreased by OGD/R, but parecoxib
treatment led to significant improvement of ATP levels
(Fig. 6b). Taken together, these data suggested that parecoxib
could inhibit OGD/R-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction.
Discussion
The purpose of the current study was to investigate the
neuroprotective effects of parecoxib on cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury using in vitro OGD/R model. In the

addition, we found that parecoxib inhibited OGD/R-induced
neurotoxicity via upregulation of CREB phosphorylation
and Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, our results
suggested that parecoxib’s neuroprotection was closely
related to the improvement of mitochondrial function.
It is known that COX-2 is involved in the cerebral ischemia
/reperfusion injury, as inhibition of COX-2 results
in the reduction of brain injury in response to global ischemia
and excitotoxicity [19], and COX-2-deficient mice
have ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage after
transient forebrain ischemia [20]. Therefore, it is reasonable
that parecoxib, a clinically used inhibitor of COX-2, is
capable of protecting against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury. Indeed, it has been reported that parecoxib confer
neuroprotective effects in transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMACO) [6] and permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMACO) rat model [7]. Consistent with
these studies, our finding suggested that parecoxib exerts
direct neuroprotective effects on primary cortical neurons
suffered from OGD/R, as treatment of parecoxib prevented
the increase of neuronal cell death over the course of reoxygenation
, determined by MTT and LDH assay. Therefore
, although parecoxib’s neuroprotective effect is largely
relied on the inhibition of inflammation induced by cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion in neurovascular, inhibition of
OGD/R-induced neurotoxicity is at least, partially responsible
for it’s neuroprotection.
Cleaved caspase-3 is a key executor in the process of
apoptosis of neurons [14], which is induced by OGD/R in
the present study. However, treatment of parecoxib significantly
inhibited OGD/R-induced expression of cleaved
caspase-3. This result indicated that parecoxib’s neuroprotective
effect was closely associated with inhibition of
neuronal apoptosis, which was consistent with previous
study that caspase-3 immunoreacivity was reduced by
parecoxib in the cerebral ischemic penumabra in rats [8]. In
addition, Akt/GSK-3b signal had been reported to be involved
in parecoxib-induced attenuation of postischemic
neuronal apoptosis [8]. However, the effectors of neuronal
survival that mediated parecoxib’s neuroprotection against
OGD-induced apoptosis still remain to be further investigated.
As Akt pathway is responsible for Bcl-2 upregulation
via activation of the CREB transcription factor [21],
we thus sought to investigate whether CREB/Bcl-2 axis
mediated neuroprotective effect of parecoxib. Consistent
with this, CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 and Bcl-2 expression
by parecoxib can be induced in a dose dependent
manner, and OGD/R inhibited CREB phosphorylation on
Ser133 and Bcl-2 expression can be partially recovered by
parecoxib. These results support the important role of
CREB phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in parecoxib
’s neuroprotection. However, we can not conclude that
the neuroprotective role of parecoxib against OGD/R is
solely relied on the CREB/Bcl-2 axis. Previous studies
suggested that neuroglobin, a key target of CREB [22], can
also protect against OGD/R-induced neurotoxicity by
amelioration of mitochondrial function [12]. Therefore,
Bcl-2 might only partially contribute to parecoxib-mediated
neuroprotection.
Recent studies suggested that endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress related proteins including GRP78, ORP150,
CHOP and Foxo1 were involved in parecoxib-mediated
neuroprotection, suggesting that inhibition of ER stress
responses may contribute to parecoxib-mediated neuroprotection
[23]. In our study, we further identified that
parecoxib could protect against OGD/R by upregulating
Bcl-2, an important mitochondria-related protein. In addition
, our results showed that parecoxib can rescue OGD/R

induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, parecoxib
protected against OGD/R induced neurotoxicity, is probably
associated with the inhibition of both ER and mitochondria-mediated
neuronal cell death. Interestingly,
accumulating evidence suggested that ER was involved in
regulating apoptosis, either independent of mitochondrial,
or in concert with mitochondria-initiated pathways [24].
Moreover, it is worth noting that Bcl-2 protein can localize
and target to the mitochondria and ER both, and promote
neuron survival [25]. It is possible that Bcl-2, as a key
effector of parecoxib, inhibits OGD/R induced neuronal
apoptosis via cross-talk between ER and mitochondriadependent
death cascades. This issue will be further elucidated
in our future study.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the neuroprotective
role of parecoxib against OGD/R-induced neuronal
injury. Our results also indicated that these neuroprotective
effects were at least partially mediated by the increase of
Bcl-2, and the maintenance of mitochondrial function. We
confidently believe that the present study will not only aid
understanding the role and mechanisms of parecoxib in
protecting against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury,
but also help in the development of therapeutic strategies to
reduce neuronal cell damage after ischemia.
