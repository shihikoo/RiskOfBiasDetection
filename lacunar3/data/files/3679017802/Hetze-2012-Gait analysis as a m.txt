Ameliorating stroke induced neurological deficits is one of the most important goals of stroke therapy. In
order to improve stroke outcome, novel treatment approaches as well as animal stroke models predictive
for the clinical setting are of urgent need. One of the main obstacles in experimental stroke research is
measuring long-term outcome, in particular in mouse models of stroke. On the other hand, assessing
functional deficits in animal models of stroke is critical to improve the prediction of preclinical findings.
Automated gait analysis provides a sensitive tool to examine locomotion and limb coordination in small
rodents. Comparing mice before and 10 days after experimental stroke (60min MCAo) we observed a
significant decrease in maximum contact area, stride length and swing speed in the hind limbs, especially
the contralateral one. Mice showed a disturbed interlimb coordination represented by changes in regularityindexandphasedispersion.Toassesswhethergaitanalysisisapplicabletoassessimprovementsby
neuroprotective compounds, we applied a model calculation and approached common statistical problems. In conclusion, gait analysis is a promising tool to assess mid- to long-term outcome in experimental
stroke research.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the one of most frequent causes of death
worldwide especially in developed countries (World Health
Organisation(WHO),2008)and,beingthemostfrequentreasonfor
adult disability (Johnston et al., 2009), puts a huge financial burden
on health care systems (Kolominsky-Rabas et al., 2006; Saka et al.,
2009). Three months after stroke, half of the survivors have still
not gained full recovery, and 25% of survivors are unable to master
their daily life without professional care (Ward et al., 2005). Consequently
, improving the life quality of stroke patients is one of the
main aims of stroke research. However, treatment options are to
date very limited and many promising substances in stroke models
havefailedinclinicalstudies(Endresetal.,2008).Analyzingneurological symptoms as gait impairments may improve the evaluation
of neurological outcome both in humans and animals. In addition
they can be suitable for the assessment of the effectiveness of new
treatment concepts.

In humans, impairment of balance control after stroke is the
main cause for gait deficits, preventing normal performance of
movementsthatrequirecomplexcoordination(e.g.pelvicandknee
controlinstancephase,swingphasehip,kneeandankleflexionand
extension) (Olney et al., 1989; Olney and Richards, 1995). Inability to perform normal movements after stroke results primarily
from an impaired swing initiation (Chen et al., 2005), which can
be explained by an inadequate leg propulsion and compensatory
mechanisms (Nadeau et al., 1999; Peterson et al., 2010).
In contrast to the availability of proper tests in patients and
ample of tests available for evaluating motor as well as cortical impairment, animal behavior after cerebral ischemia remains
to be difficult to assess in particular in mouse models of stroke.
Although tests for locomotion like rope walk (Carlini et al., 1967),
grid walk (Kunkel-Bagden et al., 1993), ladder rung test (Metz and
Whishaw, 2002) and foot print analysis (de Medinaceli et al., 1982)
unravel distinct neurological impairments after stroke, their sensitivity is too low to distinguish subtle motor impairments. Contrary
to patients, laboratory rodents, especially mice, show a quick functional recovery, which may be explained by their ecological niche
as prey animals, implying a need of compensatory mechanisms
for hiding sickness symptoms as a key for survival. (Tizard, 2008)
Assessing gait parameters with high speed cameras could unravel
these “hidden changes”, using as walkway either a glass plate for
the individual’s comfortable speed (Hamers et al., 2001) or a treadmill to obtain current walking speed (Hampton et al., 2004).

Several groups have investigated gait impairments in different
stroke models. Nevertheless, majority of this work has been carried
out in rats. In studies (Encarnacion et al., 2011; Vandeputte et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2008) with rats similar altered gait parameters
were found indicating that gait analysis is a feasible method for
animal models of stroke. Contrary to the situation in the rat, only
very little is known about gait changes after experimental stroke in
mice. This is a great disadvantage, since, to date, mice are the most
commonly used animals in stroke research, despite the difficulty of
performing behavioral tests in them. Lubjuhn and coworkers found
two parameters changed in a permanent distal MCAo model, but
do not report on inter-limb coordination (Lubjuhn et al., 2009).
In this study we aim at describing gait changes in mice after
transient filament MCAo, modeling a severe infarction in the media
territory.Weputspecialemphasisonlong-termoutcome,sincethis
is of urgent need for bench to bedside translation. To our knowledge
, until today there are no studies that have used gait analysis
as an outcome parameter for neuroprotection in mouse models of
stroke. Hence our second goal is to establish gait analysis as valid
tool for measuring mid- to long-term outcome after experimental
stroke in mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and housing
Male C57Bl6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld,
Germany) were housed in cages lined with chip bedding and
environmental enrichment (mouse tunnel and igloo; Plexx B.V.,
Elst, The Netherlands) on a 12h light/dark cycle (change 7:00 o’
clock) with ad libitum access to water and food (standard chow).
At the time of the experiment, mice were 11–14 weeks old. All
experiments were performed in accordance with the European
directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes
and approved by the relevant authority, Landesamt für Gesundheit
und Soziales, Berlin, Germany.
To compare consistence, but also due to protection of animals
reasons, we included the control animals of different experiments
fulfilling the following criteria 0.2ml Saline immediately after
stroke (Placebo treatment), 60min Middle cerebral artery occlusion with Bederson score of 2 after operation (see below) and
Gait analysis before and 10 days after stroke. In total, 31 mice
from 5 experiments were included. Inter experiment comparisons
revealed no significant or relevant difference in all gait parameters.
2.2. Stroke model
The surgical procedure of Middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) was performed as described elsewhere in detail (Engel
et al., 2011) according to the standard operating procedures of our
lab (Dirnagl and Members of the MCAO-SOP Group, 2010). In brief,
after a ventral cervical midline incision a 12mm silicon-coated
nylonfilamentwasintroducedoverthecommoncarotidarteryand
the internal carotid artery into the circle of Willis blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After an ischemia time of 60min
the filament was removed for reperfusion. Body temperature was
controlled throughout the whole procedure and Isoflurane (Abott,
Wiesbaden, Germany) in a 1:2 mixture oxygen/nitrous oxide was
used for anaesthesia. We verified success of operation by using the
Bederson score (Dirnagl and Members of the MCAO-SOP Group,
2010).
2.3. Gait analysis
Gait analysis in mice was performed with an automated
computer assisted method (CatWalkTM, Noldus Information
Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) according to manufactures instructions and published procedures (Hamers et al., 2001).
The equipment was located in a dark and silent room (<20lux of
illumination). In brief the system consists of an elevated 1.3m long
glass plate which is illuminated with a fluorescent light coming
from the side and is internally reflected in the glass. When mice
are passing the walkway and their paws contacting the glass plate,
light leaves the glass plate due to the changed refractive index and
is reflected downwards. A high-speed camera underneath the glass
plate captures the images which are subsequently analyzed by the
connected computer program. Home cage was used as bait at the
end of the walkway, and animals were trained in 3 sessions before
first measurement. We acquired a minimum of 3 compliant runs,
which had to fulfill minimum run duration of 0.5s, maximum run
durationof5s,andamaximumspeedvariationof60%.Runs,where
animals turned or walked backwards, were excluded and the animal got another try. Runs in which the software was unable to
calculate phase dispersion (Fig. 1) due to, for instance, anchor paw
being undetected, were excluded from statistical analysis.
Gait parameters can be classified into three main categories
(Hamers et al., 2006): Parameters related to (a) individual paws,
like width and length of a paw print, duration of paw contact, the
pressure caused by a paw, etc. (b) the position of footprints, for
instance relative print position, stride length and base of support
(Fig. 1A) and (c) time dependent relationship between footprints
such as phase dispersion and support formula (Fig. 1B and C). The
definitions for gait parameters we focused at are summarized in
Table 1.
2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging
One day after MCAO surgery MRI was performed in a subgroup of animals on a Bruker 7 T PharmaScan® 70/16 with a
Bruker 98/38mmRF Coil, operating on Paravision software platform (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Mice were anesthetized with
1.5% isoflurane in an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture, and body
temperature was monitored with an MR-compatible physiology
monitoring unit and maintained within physiological limits using
a heated water jacket. They were then fixed using a stereotactic frame and positioned in the magnet bore. T2 weighted MRI
was achieved with a TurboRARE sequence (imaging parameters:
256×256 in plane resolution, 20 slices with a thickness of 500m,
FOV 28.5mm, TR 3500ms, TE 56ms, acquisition time 6min). The
axial slices were chosen to cover the region between the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum. The size of the lesion apparent in
theT2weightedimagingwasdeterminedsemi-automaticallyusing
Analyze 5.0 software (AnalyzeDirect, Overland Park, KS, USA).
2.5. Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with SPSS 14.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago,IL,USA).Normaldistributionofvariableswasverifiedwith
Kolmogorov–Smirnovtest.AtypeIerror(˛)of0.05andtypeIIerror
(ˇ) of 0.2 was accepted. Parametric student’s t-test was applied to
calculate p values. Correlations between body weight and maximum contact area were assessed using Spearman’s rho correlation
coefficient. P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (*p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001). Data are expressed as
mean±standard deviation (SD) and represented as Box plots with
whiskers Minimum to Maximum.
For calculating effect sizes and a priori sample sizes the program G*Power 3.1.2 (Faul et al., 2007) was applied. Additionally
we used the comparison for effect sizes described by Matthews
and Altman (1996a) and standard procedures such as the standard
error of differences (Bland, 2000).

3. Results
Table1providesanoverviewoftheinvestigatedgaitparameters
and their changes from before to ten days after MCAo. In a subgroup of animals we measured brain lesions using MRI 1 day after
MCAO surgery. Stroke affected both, striatum and cortex with a
mean infarct volume of 18.1% of the hemisphere (edema corrected,
SD4.9,n=10;Fig.2).Rundurationdidnotdifferrelevantlybetween
the groups, despite animals walked slightly slower 10 days after
experimental stroke (Fig. 3A).
3.1. Body weight changes cannot explain gait changes after stroke
Mice subjected to MCAo had a body weight of 23.37±1.53g
before and 22.31±1.64g 10 days after surgery (Student’s t-test,
t(60)=2.620, p=0.011). Body weights did not correlate with any of
the measured Catwalk gait parameters (data not shown).
3.2. Spatial and kinetic characteristics of individual paws
Maximal contact area of hind paws and right front paw decreased
in ischemic mice. Maximal contact areas of front (Student’s ttest
, t(60)=2.092, p=0.041) and hind paws (Student’s t-test,
t(60)=5.710, p<0.0005) on affected right side were decreased 10
days after left-sided MCAo compared to baseline (before MCAo).
Also the maximal contact area of the (left) hind paw, ipsilateral
to the ischemic lesion, was decreased following MCAo (Student’s
t-test, t(60)=4.084, p=0.001) (Fig. 3B).
Stride length of hind paws decreases after MCAo. The distance between consecutive steps with right (Student’s t-test,
t(60)=2.885, p=0.005) as well as left hind paw (Student’s t-test,
t(60)=2.883, p=0.005) was shortened in mice 10 days after MCAo
comparedtothehealthyconditionofthesamegroupofmicebefore
MCAo (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the stride length of neither of the front
paws was affected by cerebral ischemia.

Normalized swing speed of hind paws is decreased in ischemic
mice. Swing speed describes the speed of a paw while it has no
contact with a glass plate. In order to overcome a possible bias
derived from animals’ individual run speed, we calculated the
distance in mm characterizing how much an animal moves forward with a particular paw over the time of the whole run (swing
speed×run duration). Compared with the healthy mice (before
MCAo), ischemia reduces the swing distances with left (Student’s
t-test, t(60)=2.943, p=0.005) and right hind paws (Student’s t-test,
t(60)=4.420, p<0.0005) (Fig. 4B).
Taken together, our data from gait analysis 10 days after leftsided MCAo demonstrate that ischemia strongly affects both hind
paws, with contralateral right more pronounced than the left hind
paws. Paw print area, stride length and normalized swing speed
were decreased by cerebral lesion.
3.3. Changes in gait coordination
Ischemia induces irregularities in step sequence patterns. Interpaw coordination during gait is based on normal step sequence
patterns of an animal. The overall inter-paw coordination during
gait(gaitregularityindexofstepsequence)isreduced10daysafter
stroke onset (Student’s t-test, t(60)=2.879, p=0.006) (Fig. 5C).
Inter-paw coordination during gait is impaired after MCAo. A
valuable parameter in assessing inter-paw coordination is also
phase dispersion which characterizes the placement of two paws
(“target” and “anchor”) during the cycle of consecutive initial
contacts with an “anchor” paw (Kloos et al., 2005). The lower
group size results from the exclusion criteria of non-detected
paws as described above. Investigating diagonal limb pairs (LF
to RH and RF to LH) 10 days after MCAo the time of hind paw

contact succeeding respective front paw contact with a glass
plate is prolonged compared to the healthy condition of the mice
before MCAo (Student’s t-test, t(54)=−5.311, p<0.0005 for LF
to RH; and Student’s t-test, t(56)=−4.141, p<0.0005 for RF to
LH; Fig. 5A). Ischemia impairs the coordination between left and
right hind paws, which was demonstrated by a shortened time
interval between right and left hind paw contact with a glass plate
(Student’s t-test, t(60)=3.170, p<0.002). Inter-paw coordination
in ipsilateral pairs, i.e. LF to LH and RF to RH, as well as between
front paws was not altered by MCAo (Fig. 5B).
In line with the alterations in individual paws, we observed
irregularities in normal step sequence patterns as well as in general inter-paw coordination in diagonal pairs (LF to RH and RF to
LH) after MCAo.
3.4. Analysis of applicability
Taken together, gait is altered after experimental stroke in mice.
To test the applicability of gait analysis we applied a model calculation assuming an arbitrary neuroprotective agent called “substance
X”. On the one hand an improvement by 100%, so complete recovery
, is rather an unachievable goal, on the other hand only a
minor improvement may be not relevant for a clinical setting.
Thus, we define that substance X should improve gait deficits at
least by 50%, which is in our experience a feasible and realistic
value.
Here we use phase dispersions LF-RH as an example for examining different statistical methods commonly used in analyzing
behavioral data. As described above, this parameter changes from
2.4%(±5.4)beforeto10.3%(±5.7)afterexperimentalstroke,resulting in a calculated mean phase dispersion of 6.5% (±5.5) among
animals treated with substance X. The effect size (Cohen, 1988) for
three groups is f=0.6, per definition a strong effect. Computing the
required sample size with the preconditions ˛=0.05 and ˇ=0.8
(Power) one gets a critical F of 3.24 and a required total sample size
of 45, hence 15 per group. This is a commonly used group size for
stroke studies.
However,thisisonlyvalidforthecomparisonbetweenthethree
groups. Usually neuroprotection studies aim to demonstrate a protective effect for verum (e.g. substance X) compared to placebo (e.g.
vehicle)treatment.Whereastheeffectsizecomparingbaselineand
placebo is relative large (d=1.5), the effect size comparing placebo
andsubstanceXaccountswithd=0.75onlyforamediumsizeeffect.
Hence one would need only 8 animals per group to show a significant difference between baseline and placebo (˛=0.05; ˇ=0.8;
two-tailed), but 30 per group to show a significant difference in
Student’s t-test between the both treatments.
To deal with the often smaller groups of animals, one may be
tempted to compare both treatments against baseline to show that
only placebo treatment results in significant changes in gait. This
maybemisleading,sincethe p-valueisdependentontheeffectsize
and also on the precision of the effect’s estimation, so its standard
error (Matthews and Altman, 1996b). Hence without providing all
information including effect size, sample size per group and distribution
, this might result in false positive conclusions.
In our model calculation, we “observed” a large difference
in effect size between treatment with substance X and placebo.
Consequently we would need a statistical test that assumes as
null hypothesis that the true effect sizes are the same in both
groups.
Matthews and Altman described a suitable procedure based on
the differences between the treatments and the standard error of
the difference (Matthews and Altman, 1996a). Applying this, we
detect a significant difference between placebo and substance X
(Table 2). To calculate the group sizes needed, first we take the
formula for the test statistic

For significant values, per definition z has to be greater than 1.96 or
smaller than −1.96 for two sided tests, other values can be inserted
from our experiments and the assumptions described above. As a
result we get a required sample size of 21 for a 50% improvement,
16 for a 60% improvement and 12 for a 70% improvement. If only
improvement is of interest, e.g. in testing neuroprotective drugs,
one could use this test as one-sided test (z would have then to be
larger 1.65 or smaller −1.65), hence further reducing sample size
(Bland and Altman, 1994).
4. Discussion
Gait is a coordinated action of different subtasks. Hypothesizing
that severe cerebral ischemia in mice disturbs the well coordinated
interplay between the 4 limbs, we observed significant differences
in the swing speed and stride length of the hind paws. Hence
we conclude that the swing subtask in hind limbs is impaired
in mid- to long-term outcome after stroke. A decreased intensity
of foot prints in both hind paws may be an indicator of reduced
propulsionbyhindpaws.Incomparison,hemipareticpatientsafter
stroke show deficits in swing initiation and forward propulsion
(Hall et al., 2011). In addition, we observed a decrease of maximum contact area in both hind paws after experimental stroke,
alsosuggestingalesseffectiveuseinweightbearingandpropulsion
(Vrinten and Hamers, 2003). The strong effects of stroke in the hind
paws, especially in the contralateral one, may reflect the neuroanatomical conditions. In addition, the impairment of one subtask
couldexplainpartiallytheobserveddisturbanceininter-limbcoordination.However,sincewealsoseeaworsecoordinationbetween
the hind limbs, we assume that also the overall coordination of gait
is impaired.
In our study, post-stroke mice have an increase in stand time
in both front paws. The duty cycle, meaning the fraction of weight
bearing in the whole step cycle, was slightly increased in both front
paws and decreased in hind paws. This may represent a compensatory mechanism in which the front paws support the impaired
function of the hind paws.
In terms of interlimb coordination, we observed changes in regularity index, as well as in phase dispersions in the diagonal pairs
and in the back girdle pair. It is of great importance to consider,
that the change from walk to trot affects the lateral and diagonal
phase dispersions, but not the girdle pairs (Hamers et al., 2006). In
our study, mice passed the walkway trotting, which was favored
by setting a short time limit for valid runs. Additionally, we did
not observe the typical signs of walking in phase dispersion. During walk, diagonal pairs’ phase dispersion is around 75%, where we
detected a change from 0 to 2% (typical for trot) to about 7–10%
after stroke. We did not observe the typical change in lateral phase
dispersion switching from walk to trot, but untypically in girdle
pairs’ phase dispersion. The not well timed placement of diagonal
pairs may affect the stability of the diagonal support phase in trot,
whichmayaccountformoreirregularsteppatterns.Thus,interlimb
coordination is impaired in the MCAo model.
In line with data from ischemic rats, we observed significant
changes in the maximum contact area and inter-limb coordination. Wang et al. reported in a rat model of distal Middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) a decreased paw print intensity, maximal
area of paw contact and a disturbed limb coupling both 4 days
and 5 weeks after stroke. Interestingly, a treatment with excessive
enriched environment improved these deficits significantly (Wang
et al., 2008). In a rat photothrombotic model, stroke decreased
intensities and contact areas of the contralateral hind paw. However
, these changes were observed at a very early time point of one
day after experimental stroke (Vandeputte et al., 2010). Similar to
our observations, swing speed in the contralateral hind paw was
diminished over 12 weeks in rat model of severe stroke. In addition
, for up to two weeks the duty cycle and paw print intensity
were decreased as well as the disturbed inter-limb coordination
was disturbed (Encarnacion et al., 2011).
In the only published investigation in mice, Lubjuhn and colleagues described several functional tests after permanent distal
MCAo,amongthemthreedifferentsystemstomeasuregait.Incontrast to our study differences in stance and brake duration two days
after surgery were observed using automated systems with and
without treadmill. In contrast, differences in stride length were not
observed(Lubjuhnetal.,2009).Sincethemodelofpermanentdistal
MCAo results in cortical lesions and ours affects cortex and striatum these differences might be explained by the different stroke
models. Furthermore, they do not report on the inter-limb coordination or any other temporal parameters that could reveal deficits
in walking subtasks.
An important limitation of the Catwalk system is the dependency on walking speed, as gait velocity is an important influence
factor on many gait parameters, and consequently we either correctedforthisorusedparametersindependentfromwalkingspeed.
Although infarct volume does not necessarily correlate with functional impairment (Encarnacion et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2009), it
is a limitation of our study that we did not correlate functional
impairment and infarct volume due to our experimental setup.
Furthermore, this study is only valid for the model and time point
we have investigated. From the work of other groups (Encarnacion
et al., 2011) we assume that differences are more pronounced at
earlier time points. In human stroke research 3 month after stroke
onset are accepted as time point for assessing long-term outcome.
Incontrast,generallyacceptedtimepointsformeasuringlong-term
outcome in stroke models of mice have not been defined. Since
the acute phase is completed within the first week after stroke
(Dirnagl et al., 2003), measurement ten days after stroke reflects
mid- to long-term outcome, considering the short recovery time of
mice compared to humans after stroke. Longer follow up intervals
are needed to investigate whether gait analysis is appropriate for
long-term outcome in murine stroke research.
Analyzingtheapplicabilityofgaitanalysisintestingnovelstroke
treatments, there are only a few parameters which show an effect
large enough to detect gait improvements. But even then, one
would need 15–20 animals per group to detect neuroprotective or
regenerative effects at this late time point. This may be hampered
by the high mortality, caused by neurological reasons and medical
complications like infections (Meisel and Meisel, 2011). Especially
between day 3 and day 6 animals are at a high risk to develop pneumonia with a high attributable mortality (Engel and Meisel, 2010),
whichmayalsoinfluencetheindividualsmotivationtowalk.Taken
together gait analysis is a valuable tool to detect changes, but it is
only one piece of the puzzle in measuring neurological outcome
after experimental stroke.
In conclusion, our data suggest that gait is similarly altered in
mice and human stroke. Hence gait analysis – together with other
tests – may be a good predictor for the effectiveness of potential
therapeutic compounds in bench to bedside translation. However

it remains a challenging task to measure functional deficits in laboratory rodents after experimental stroke. For further research, very
sensitive measures for skilled walk may be a promising way to
increase the effect size and the sensitivity comparing treatments.
