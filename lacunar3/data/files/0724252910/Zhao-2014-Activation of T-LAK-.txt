T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a MAPKK-like kinase, is
crucial for neural progenitor cell proliferation; however, the function of
TOPK and the molecular mechanism underlying cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of TOPK
in experimental stroke. Sprague–Dawley rats underwent transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and reperfusion, and TOPK small
interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered by intracerebroventricular injection
at the beginning of MCAO. After TOPK overexpression and H

O
2
stimulation in PC12 neuronal cells, antioxidative proteins, apoptosis-related
proteins and signal pathways were detected by western blot analysis, the
levels of the peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 3–nitrotyrosine)
were measured with ELISA. Phosphorylation of TOPK was increased in
rat cortical neurons following tMCAO. TOPK overexpression in PC12 cells
augmented levels of antioxidative proteins (peroxiredoxin 1 and 2, heme
oxygenase 1 and manganese superoxide dismutase), as well as total superoxide
dismutase activity, along with inhibition of malondialdehyde and
3–nitrotyrosine upon H

stimulation. TOPK overexpression increased
cell viability and reduced expression of caspase 3 and caspase 12 in PC12
cells in response to H

. The p–ERK level was increased by TOPK overexpression
, and antioxidative protection afforded by TOPK was abolished
by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells.
TOPK siRNA increased the infarct volume and reduced total superoxide
dismutase activity in the cortex in vivo after MCAO. These data reveal that
activating TOPK confers neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury by antioxidative function, in part through activation of
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.

Introduction
Oxidative stress is an important injurious factor in
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, which ultimately results
in the activation of apoptotic and necrotic signaling
pathways [1]. Thus, an antioxidative regimen is considered
to be a promising strategy for stroke therapy.
T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a
MAPKK-like serine/threonine kinase, is widely
expressed in cancer cells and functions to promote
carcinogenesis and inhibit apoptosis [2–6]. Previously,
TOPK has been shown to be highly expressed in neural
stem cells, and expressed in rapidly proliferating
cells in the early postnatal cerebellar external granular
layer and adult subependymal zone [7]. It has been
reported that TOPK is activated in neuronal progenitor
cells in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and inhibition
of TOPK disrupts progenitor self-renewal and
proliferation [7]. Although TOPK is essential for neural
progenitors, its expression and function in neuronal
cells after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion is still
unknown.
By contrast, TOPK has been shown to prevent
apoptosis induced by UVB in RPMI7951 human melanoma
cells by regulating peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) peroxidase
activity and blocking intracellular H2
O
2
accumulation [8], suggesting that TOPK has an effect
on the level of oxidative stress. To date, no study has
been published with respect to the function of TOPK
in antioxidative stress during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury. We hypothesized that cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury may enhance the expression or
activity of TOPK, and TOPK activation triggers
neurons to express antioxidative molecules, which contribute
to neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury. This study was designed to test this
hypothesis and gain further insight into the related
signaling pathway.
Results
Phosphorylation of TOPK in neurons is increased
after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO)
In our previous study, the gene expression profiles of
ipsilateral cortices of sham and tMCAO groups were
subjected to microarray analysis [9]. Using the same
approach, we found that the mRNA level of TOPK
was significantly elevated after 2 h ischemia/24 h reperfusion
among the MAPK family members, indicating
that TOPK might play an important role in cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion (Table 1). To investigate the
involvement of the activation of TOPK in ischemia–
reperfusion injury and the target cells, we examined the
expression of p–TOPK and its cellular localization in a
sham group and ischemic cortex (Fig. 1). Western blot
analysis showed that the p–TOPK/TOPK level was
increased significantly in the tMCAO group compared
with the sham group at 4 and 24 h reperfusion after 2 h
of ischemia (P < 0.05, Fig. 1A). In addition, p–TOPK-
positive cells were colocalized with neurons, with a
higher p–TOPK content was observed in the MCAO
group than the sham group, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence
(Fig. 1B). Taken together, the activation
of TOPK at a late time point after reperfusion and its
residence in neurons after tMCAO imply the involvement
of TOPK in neuronal injury upon reperfusion,
and suggest that TOPK might be a potential therapeutic
target for focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.

cells, a cell culture commonly used in the study of
neurons, was detected 48 h after TOPK overexpression
vector transfection. Western blot analysis showed the
overexpression of TOPK (Fig. 2A, P < 0.05), and that
the expression of antioxidative proteins [Prx–1, Prx–2,
heme oxygenase 1 (HO–1) and manganese superoxide
dismutase], as well as total superoxide dismutase
(SOD) activity, were all significantly increased after
TOPK overexpression compared with control cells
(Fig. 2B–D, P < 0.05). These results suggested that
TOPK overexpression and activation might promote
an increase in the levels of antioxidative proteins.

by TOPK overexpression (Fig. 3C, P < 0.05).
Moreover, the levels of activated caspase 3 and caspase 12 were both depressed by TOPK overexpression

(Fig. 3D,E, P < 0.05). Taken together, the data

of TOPK-increased cell viability and total SOD activity,
and partial reversal of TOPK-decreased MDA and

that p–ERK is a likely downstream kinase of
TOPK because of its antioxidative function in oxidative

volume using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining in rats after 2 h ischemia/24 h reperfusion
upon treatment with TOPK siRNA via intracerebroventricular
injection. First, using western blot
analysis, we identified the knockdown of TOPK in the
ischemic brain after TOPK siRNA treatment (Fig. 6A,
P < 0.05). The infarction volume of rat brain after
ischemia–reperfusion was increased by TOPK siRNA
treatment (Fig. 6B, P < 0.05). In addition, total SOD
activity was increased after tMCAO, but was reduced
by TOPK siRNA treatment (Fig. 6C, P < 0.05). As a
result, the MDA level, as a marker of lipid oxidation
and which was elevated in the ischemic brain of
MCAO rats, was further increased by TOPK siRNA
treatment (Fig. 6D, P < 0.05). The change in cerebral
blood flow during ischemia–reperfusion was determined
in rats from the MCAO and the MCAO +
TOPK siRNA groups. Laser Doppler showed that
there were no significant differences between the two
groups, and we show one images of cerebral blood
flow during ischemia and reperfusion in rats (Fig. 6E).
Thus, the in vivo data demonstrated that antioxidation
is implicated in the neuroprotective mechanism of
TOPK against focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury.
Discussion and conclusion
Oxidative stress is a pivotal cellular response to cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion, characterized by excessive
levels of reactive oxygen species, a major cause of
neuronal injury [11]. To overcome oxidative stress, the
cell is equipped with a three-part antioxidant defense
system: downregulating reactive oxygen species generation
[12]; eliminating reactive oxygen species with
neutralizing enzymes and scavenger molecules [13];

and repairing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins or
DNA [14,15], which collectively or separately offer
potential therapeutic targets for antioxidative stress in
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.
Several reports have demonstrated the potential of
TOPK to attenuate apoptosis and enhance antioxidant
capacity in cancer cell lines. For example, TOPK has
been shown to inhibit As3+-induced apoptosis through
induction of histone H2AX phosphorylation [16],
stable TOPK knockdown increases apoptosis in
human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and breast
adenocarcinoma cells (MCF–7) via interaction with
p53 [17], and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis in
human epithelial carcinoma cell HeLa was found to be
noticeably increased after TOPK knockdown by IjBa
phosphorylation [18]. In addition, TOPK was shown
to prevent apoptosis induced by UVB in RPMI7951
human melanoma cells through phosphorylation of
Prx1 and reduced H
2
O
2
accumulation [8]. By contrast,
TOPK has been reported to be activated in neural progenitors
in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and inhibition
of TOPK disrupts progenitor self-renewal and
proliferation [7]; however, the changes and function of
TOPK in brain ischemic injury have not been
reported. The evidence from this study showed the
critical importance of TOPK in the management of
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. Our data demonstrated
that the mRNA level of TOPK was significantly
elevated after 2 h ischemia/24 h reperfusion
among the MAPK family members. Further studies
clearly documented the activation of TOPK after
ischemia–reperfusion and residence in neurons by
western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, we
proved using in vivo and in vitro experiments that
TOPK inhibits oxidative stress and decreases neuronal
damage. TOPK is thus a potential target for the management
of focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
through decreasing oxidative stress and subsequent
neuronal apoptosis.
Since the identification of TOPK as a novel
MAPKK-like protein kinase [3], further studies have
been conducted with respect to downstream targets
[19–24]. TOPK has been reported to phosphorylate
and inactivate PTEN, which in turn activates Akt,
leading to proper G
2
/M progression in HeLa cells [19].
Similarly, TOPK promotes lung cancer cell migration
by regulating the PTEN/Akt pathway [20], and TOPK
knockdown reduces AKT phosphorylation in human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [21]. Additional downstream
targets of PDZ binding kinase/TOPK include
the MAP kinase family members (ERK2, JNK1 and
p38) [22–24]. Most of the studies were conducted using
cancer cells. By contrast, the phosphatidylinositol
3 kinase/AKT pathway is recognized to be involved in
antiapoptosis and neuroprotection against cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury [25], and cumulative evidence
shows activation of ERK as a protective
response in PC12 cells and rat ischemic models [26,27].
In light of these results, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective
effect of TOPK might be related to phosphorylation
of the PTEN/Akt or ERK pathway. Of
note, this study demonstrated a significant increase in
the p–ERK level after TOPK treatment in PC12 cells
exposed to H
2
O
2
, suggesting that ERK is the downstream
target for the beneficial role of TOPK overexpression
in oxidative stress upon H
2
O
2
stimulation.
This idea is further supported by the fact that application
of the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, nearly abolished
the neuroprotection afforded by TOPK overexpression
in PC12 cells. In this study, PTEN/Akt was not activated
by TOPK, in contrast to ERK, which is in
agreement with the report by Zhu et al. [22], but was
inconsistent with the results of Shih et al. [19–21], indicating
that TOPK might have different downstream
targets in different cell types or cell models.
In summary, our study demonstrated for the first
time the role of MAPKK-like serine/threonine kinase
TOPK in oxidative stress in ischemic neuronal injury.
The major findings of this study were as follows: (a)
the expression of p–TOPK is increased after cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion, and p–TOPK resides in neurons;
(b) TOPK overexpression in PC12 neuronal cells
increases the antioxidative protein levels, which is in
agreement with its inhibition on peroxidative products
upon H2
O
2
stimulation; (c) TOPK overexpression in
PC12 cells increases p–ERK levels and inhibition of
p–ERK pathway partly abolished its anti-oxidative
effect; and (d) TOPK siRNA increases tMCAO-
induced brain injury in vivo, as evidenced by the
increased infarct volume. This study demonstrated that
TOPK may reverse focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury by antioxidative function partly through activation
of the ERK pathway, suggesting TOPK as a
potential target for the development of novel medications
to ameliorate ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, the
mechanism responsible for the neuroprotection of
TOPK needs to be elucidated in further studies.

in male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 280–310 g [28]. Rats
were randomly divided into three groups (sham operation,
MCAO + control siRNA, and MCAO + TOPK siRNA
groups). The siRNA-Topk-rat-745 was as follows: sense,
50–GGAGACAUAAAGUCUUCAATT–30; and antisense,
50–UUGAAGACUUUAUGUCUCCTT–30. TOPK siRNA
(10 lL) or control siRNA with a scrambled sequence
(20 lM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
was injected into the cerebral lateral ventricles (20 lM;
GenePharma, Shanghai, China) immediately after the
MCAO. Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by
laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000; Perimed,
Stockholm, Sweden) at the following coordinates: 5.0 mm
lateral and 0.5 mm anterior from the bregma. The ipsilateral
cerebral blood flow decreased to 15–25% of the baseline.
Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 °C with a
temperature-controlled heating pad (CMA 150; Carnegie
Medicin, AB, Stockholm, Sweden) during and after surgery.
After recovering from anesthesia, all rats were housed
in an air-conditioned room at 25  1 °C.
TTC staining and infarct volume determination
The rats were killed after 2 h ischemia/24 h perfusion and
the brains were removed and processed for TTC staining.
For this purpose, 2-mm thick coronal sections were cut 3,
5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 mm posterior of the olfactory bulb. Slices
were incubated in 2% TTC solution for 30 min at 37 °C,
then fixed in 10% formalin. The stained sections were photographed
with a digital camera and infarct volumes were
calculated according to the regional lack of TTC staining.
Briefly, the border between noninfarcted and infarcted tissues
was outlined, and the infarction area was calculated
by subtracting the noninfarcted area of the ipsilateral hemisphere
from the contralateral hemisphere. The infarct volume
was calculated as the sum of the thickness9 infarct
areas, and expressed as a percentage of the lesioned half of
the brain. The analysis was performed by investigators
blinded to the experimental groups.
Western blot
After 2 h of ischemia and 1, 4 or 24 h of perfusion, the rats
were killed and brains were removed. The ipsilateral cortex
of the brain or PC12 cells were homogenized in a lysis
buffer (1% Triton X–100, 100 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris/
HCl, pH 7.5) containing phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma
cocktail; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and protease inhibitors
(leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin and phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride). Total protein (100 lg) was resolved by SDS
gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Blots were incubated with the following primary
antibodies (1 : 1000) at 4 °C overnight: p–TOPK (Thr9),
TOPK, p–PTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383); PTEN, p–Akt
(Ser473); Akt, p–ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204); ERK; Prx–1
(Cell Signaling Technology, Waltham, MA, USA); Prx-2;
HO–1 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA); manganese
superoxide dismutase (Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA); caspase 3; caspase 12 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); and
b–actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals
were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min
at room temperature and an enhanced luminescence kit
(Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
Immunofluorescence
Rats were killed 24 h after reperfusion with intraperitoneal
injections of chloral hydrate and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
in NaCl/P
i
. Following incubation in a blocking
solution (0.3% Triton X–100, 2% normal goat serum, 1%
bovine serum albumin and 5% skimmed milk powder in
NaCl/P
i
) for 2 h, frozen coronal sections were incubated in
the primary antibodies against p–TOPK (Thr9) (1 : 50)
and NeuN (1 : 80; Millipore). After washing with NaCl/P
i
,
sections were incubated with a mixture of fluorescent
secondary antibodies (Alexa 594/Alexa 488-conjugated
anti-mouse/anti-rabbit IgG; Abcam). Images were captured
by a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).
Cell culture and treatment
Rat PC12 cells were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry
and Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Science,
Shanghai, China) and cultured in six-well plates (Corning
Incorporated, New York, NY, USA) in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium containing 5% horse serum, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 1% streptomycin and 1% penicillin. Cell cultures
were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified environment
containing 5% CO
2
. pcDNA3.1–TOPK (Invitrogen, Carlsbad
, CA, USA) was transfected into PC12 cells for 48 h
using lipofectimine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer
’s protocol. To initiate oxidative stress, PC12 cells
were stimulated by H
2
O
2
(100 lM) for 6 h, then collected
for assessment.
Cell viability
PC12 cells were seeded in 96-well dishes at a density of
19 104 cells per well. After treatment, cell viability was
assessed using the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo Laboratories,
Kumamoto, Japan) as previously reported [29].
Detection of MDA, 3–NT and SOD
Ten percent (w/v) brain homogenates were prepared with
cold NaCl/P
i
, and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min.
ELISA was used for determination of the level of 3–NT
(Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, China) in the supernatants, while

the Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit-Thiobarbituric
Acid (TBA) method and SOD Assay Kit-WST method
were used for evaluation of MDA levels and SOD activity
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China),
respectively, in brain and cell homogenates according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was assessed at
450 nm using a microplate reader. MDA and 3–NT levels
and total SOD activity in brain or cell homogenate were
normalized to the total protein.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as the means  SEM and statistically
analyzed with one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s post hoc test. P < 0.05 was considered
significant.
