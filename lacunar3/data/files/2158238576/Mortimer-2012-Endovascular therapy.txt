Endovascular therapy for acute basilar artery
occlusion: a review of the literature
A M Mortimer, M Bradley, S A Renowden
ABSTRACT
Basilar artery occlusion is an infrequent form of acute
stroke; clinical outcomes are heterogeneous, but the
condition can be fatal. There is a lack of randomized
controlled trial data in this field. Case series suggest that
patients who are recanalized have much better
outcomes than those who are not, and it is generally
accepted that intra-arterial techniques achieve high rates
of recanalization. Controversially, several studies,
including a meta-analysis and registry-based
investigation, that have compared intravenous
thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial treatment suggest
similar outcomes. However, there are many potential
sources of bias in each of these studies, precluding
a firm conclusion. Indeed, there are many confounding
factors that can influence the outcome including severity
of presentation, site of occlusion, clot load, degree of
collateral flow, timing of therapy, agent used for
recanalization and dose of thrombolytic agent.
Additionally, pretreatment infarct core imaging using
diffusion-weighted imaging and the posterior circulation
Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS)
scoring systems have been shown to predict outcome
and therefore may be useful in selecting patients for
aggressive therapy. Protocols combining intravenous
agents such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists
or thombolytics agents with intra-arterial techniques
(‘bridging’ therapy) have shown encouraging
improvements in neurological outcome and survival.
Furthermore, initial case series describing the use of
mechanical clot extraction devices or aspiration
catheters suggest high rates of recanalization. What
would be useful is a randomized trial comparing IVT,
endovascular approaches and a combined IVT/
endovascular approach. However, the small numbers of
patients and multiple confounding factors are barriers to
the development of such a trial.
INTRODUCTION
Basilar artery occlusion is an uncommon cause of
stroke, accounting for only 6e10% of large vessel
strokes.1The most common underlying mechanism
is atherosclerosis, but the basilar artery is also
affected by embolism from both cardiac and proximal
arterial sources, dissections, migraine and
inflammatory conditions.2 The condition presents
with a variety of clinical signs and symptoms.3
Most patients suffer prodromal symptoms in the
preceding 2 weeks including headache, vertigo or
both. In the acute presentation, altered levels of
consciousness, dysarthria, paresis, hemiplegia or
tetraplegia, ataxia, cranial nerve deficits and
supranuclear occulomotor disturbances are the
commonest presenting signs. Although prognosis is
variable, basilar occlusion has traditionally been
thought to be associated with a poor outcome.1 4 5 
More recently there has been an emphasis on acute
therapeutic recanalization to re-establish perfusion,
with several case series suggesting a reduction
in mortality and improved functional outcomes
following thrombolytic treatment. There is
controversy as to the best mode of treatment4e8;
both intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or
endovascular techniques including intra-arterial
thrombolysis (IAT) and mechanical clot extraction
are advocated, though each mode of treatment has
its proponents.4e8 In this study we explore the
literature comparing IVT and IAT and examine
the evidence pertaining to the use of endovascular
techniques such as mechanical thrombectomy and
thromboaspiration used to assist recanalization.
NATURAL HISTORY
The majority of patients presenting with basilar
artery occlusion are aged 50e80 years, although
women tend to present at an older age than men.2
Significant risk factors for basilar occlusion include
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidemia
, coronary and peripheral vascular disease
and previous stroke. The majority of patients have
transient ischemic attacks preceding the onset of
stroke.2 It is difficult to obtain a universal view
from the literature regarding the prognosis of
this population when managed conservatively.
Comparisons across observational studies are difficult
because of differences in eligibility criteria and
in classifications of favorable outcome. Bearing this
in mind, some studies have reported favorable
outcomes in 44e77% of patients while others
have described poor outcome rates in 54e95% of
patients (table 1).2 9 e16 The results highlight the
fact that prognosis is diverse, and that this condition
should be considered as a disease spectrum
with various factors influencing the prognosis (see
below). Indeed, as the natural history of basilar
occlusion is so varied, there is considerable difficulty
in assessing the positive and negative impact
of treatment; this is probably the source of much of
the controversy pertaining to treatment of this
condition. What is certain is that the outcome can
be very poor and that strategies to select those who
will respond to treatment are warranted.

etiology of occlusion and presentation in the New

consecutive patients with posterior circulation ischemia identified 55 patients with moderate (50e70%) or severe (>70%)
basilar stenosis and 32 patients with basilar occlusion as documented
by MR angiography, conventional angiography or
transcranial Doppler sonography. Factors that were significantly
associated with more severe outcomes by univariate analysis
were distal territory involvement, embolic etiology and basilar
artery occlusion. One explanation for a poorer outcome in
embolic occlusions is that emboli most often lodge in the rostral
basilar artery and that these patients have less time to develop
collateral circulation to maintain perfusion. Likewise, patients
with basilar stenoses who have residual flow are at lower risk of
severe outcomes than those with basilar occlusion.
As well as pathological predictors of poor outcome, clinical
predictors include decreased level of consciousness, tetraparesis
and abnormal pupils. In the New England Medical Center
Posterior Circulation Registry2 these clinical signs increased the
probability of major disability or death 3e4-fold. Devuyst et al9
found that decreased consciousness was the single most
powerful prognostic factor in basilar disease, followed by
pupillary disorders, bulbar signs and dysarthria.
INTRA-ARTERIAL THROMBOLYSIS (IAT): WHAT IS THE
EVIDENCE?
The first description of the use of IATwas published in the early
1980s.17However, randomized clinical trial data for intra-arterial
thrombolytic therapy for basilar artery occlusion are lacking and
are limited to a single small study of only 16 patients that was
prematurely terminated because of slow recruitment and withdrawal
of the sale of urokinase in Australia.18 Patients were
randomized to receive treatment with intra-arterial urokinase or
control. All received heparin for a minimum of 2 days and then
oral warfarin. In the eight patients who received thrombolysis,
four died and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was 1 in the
survivors. In eight patients in the control group, four died and
the mRS score was 3 in the survivors. This showed no significant
difference in outcome between the two groups although it did
suggest a benefit for thrombolytic therapy. It is, however,
certainly too small to draw meaningful conclusions and the
results are not sufficient to provide randomized clinical trial
evidence for or against the general application of IAT.
There have, however, been multiple series describing the use
of IAT in the treatment of basilar occlusion. Unfortunately, each
series differs in the method and timing of follow-up and method
of documentation of favorable or poor outcome. It is therefore
problematic to attempt a reliable comparison of clinical
outcomes across studies and, for this reason, mortalityda relatively
easily comparable outcome measuredhas been used as
a comparison across studies.
A large meta-analysis1 that incorporated 10 studies including
316 patients reported an overall recanalization rate of 64% and
overall mortality of 56%. The mortality was 87% in non-recanalized
patients and 37% in recanalized patients, resulting in a 48%
absolute risk reduction of death (p<0.001). The rate of symptomatic
intracranial hemorrhage in this analysis was only 7%.
In the most recent and the largest series to date,19 the data of
180 adult patients with angiographically-confirmed basilar
occlusion treated with IAT at five German stroke centers were
retrospectively evaluated. Patients with partial or complete
recanalization had a significantly better neurological outcome
than non-recanalized patients (p<0.001). For 38 (86%) of 44
patients who had no recanalization, the post-treatment
outcome measured using the mRS was 5 or 6; such a poor
outcome was present in only 32 (33%) of 97 patients with
full recanalization and in 43% of patients with partial recanalization.
Conversely, in patients with a good post-treatment
outcome (mRS score 0e2), only 2% of patients had no recanalization
whereas 34% had partial and 29% had complete recanalization.
These results emphasize the notion that complete or
at least partial recanalization of the occlusion is essential for
a favorable neurological outcome. Furthermore, even partial

recanalization resulted in a relatively satisfactory post-treatment
mRS score of 0e4 in 57% of patients compared with 14% in
non-recanalized patients. In keeping with this finding, a metaanalysis
of all case series involving >10 patients with basilar
occlusion who underwent IAT with urokinase and/or recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) during the 1987e97
period (n¼164 patients) found that failure to recanalize was
associated with higher mortality.20
FACTORS IMPACTING ON OUTCOME IN PATIENTS TREATED
WITH IAT
As well as failure to recanalize, an additional factor associated
with higher mortality in Schulte-Altedorneburg’s large series
was the presence of coma on presentation (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.26
to 2.99; n¼145).19 Intriguingly, however, it has recently been
shown that low levels of consciousness assessed using the
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) did not correlate with poor neurological
outcome in 40 patients with acute basilar artery thrombosis
managed with intra-arterial therapy. Equal numbers of
patients with a good neurological outcome (mRS score 1; n¼12)
had a GCS of#6or>6. In those with GCS#6 for>3 h, 33.3%
had a good neurological outcome and this was a similar rate to
that of the overall cohort. The authors concluded that it is
therefore not appropriate to exclude patients from intra-arterial
therapy on the basis of a low presenting GCS.21
The presence of collateral flow via posterior communicating
arteries has been shown to correlate with neurological outcome
in patients treated with IAT.22 Clot location, mechanism of
formation and volume have also been shown to impact on
outcome: in patients treated with IAT, thrombus location in the
distal one-third of the basilar artery is associated with a lower
mortality than thrombus location in the proximal and/or middle
portions of the basilar artery (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86;
n¼126).23 Likewise, where studies have classified etiology,23 24
higher recanalization rates are seen in embolic occlusion than in
atherothrombotic occlusion (66% and 72% vs 19% and 60%,
respectively). Better neurological outcome following IAT for
embolic occlusions has also been demonstrated. This should be
tempered by the findings of others who have failed to show
a significant difference relating to etiology.19 Thrombus volume
has also been shown to impact on recanalization following IAT;
as thrombus volume exceeds 300ml, the recanalization rate
decreased significantly.19
There is no conclusive evidence regarding timing of therapy.
Eckert et al23 found a significantly better clinical outcome in
patients with acute basilar occlusion treated within 6 h of
symptom onset than in patients treated after >6h(p¼0.005).
Sixteen of 33 patients treated within 6 h survived, 12 (36%)
with a favorable outcome (Barthel Index >90) and four (12%)
with an unfavorable outcome (Barthel Index <90). Mortality
was 52% (n¼17). In late therapy onset (n¼43), only three
patients survived with a favorable outcome (7%), 10 survived
with an unfavorable outcome (23%) and 30 patients died
(mortality 70%). Sixteen patients were only treated after 10 h,
12 of whom died (mortality 75%), and all four survivors had an
unfavorable outcome. They concluded that performing IAT is
not reasonable if the patient has had a severe neurological deficit
for >6 h. However, Arnold et al25 found no significant association
between time to treatment and favorable clinical outcome
(mRS score 0e2) in 40 patients treated with IATwithin 12 h of
symptom onset. Likewise, Schulte-Altenbourge et al19 found
that neither the duration of brain stem stroke symptoms nor the
coma duration was an independent variable for a favorable
neurological outcome (mRS score 0e2). Noufal et al26 described
several patients presenting>8 h after symptom onset with poor
clinical predictors including depressed levels of consciousness
who had good outcomes following mechanical thrombectomy.26
Importantly, these patients did not show evidence of extensive
brain stem infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The
point has been made previously that patients who survive for
a longer period following symptom onset may have better
collateral pathways.22 The current findings would therefore
suggest that strict application of rigid temporal exclusion criteria
is not warranted. Indeed, lower rates of complicating post-therapeutic
hemorrhage in the posterior circulation and the frequent
catastrophic natural history of this condition lead many clinicians
to favor a less conservative approach in these patients.
Perhaps application of imaging to elucidate the extent of
pretreatment core infarct will help select patients for treatment.
Indeed, several studies have shown that radiological predictors
, including the brain stem DWI score or the posterior
circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS)
based on CT angiography source images (CTASI), are independent
predictors of clinical outcome in patients treated with IAT
or other means of endovascular therapy.27e29
CTASI can improve the conspicuity and therefore the sensitivity
of acutely ischemic areas over that depicted by nonenhanced
CT imaging and, effectively, the source images provide
information on brain perfusion. Puetz et al27 aimed to quantify
early ischemic changes seen on CTASI to predict functional
outcome in patients with basilar artery occlusion using the pc-
ASPECTS score, which allocates the posterior circulation 10
points. One point each is subtracted for hypoattenuation on
CTASI in the left or right thalamus, cerebellum or posterior
cerebral artery territory, respectively, and two points each are
subtracted for hypoattenuation on CTASI in any part of the
midbrain or pons. A pc-ASPECTS score of 10 indicates absence
of visible posterior circulation ischemia; a score of 0 indicates
hypoattenuation in all pc-ASPECTS territories. Of 46 patients
with basilar artery occlusion, 52% (12/23) with a CTASI
pc-ASPECTS score$8 but only 4% (1/23) with a score#8 had
a favorable functional outcome (mRS score 0e2). This difference
was consistent in 21 patients with angiographic recanalization.
In contrast, patients with a CTASI pc-ASPECTS score$8 were
less likely to die. The authors conclude that the CTASI pc-
ASPECTS score can identify patients who will have a poor
clinical outcome despite recanalization. In a further study, the
same group have shown that the extent of hypoattenuation on
the initial CTASI predicts the final infarct extent (based on the
pc-ASPECTS score) in patients with basilar artery occlusion.28
Similarly, Cho et al29 evaluated the extent of the brain stem
DWI lesion load on pretreatment MRI according to the affected
arterial territories of the medulla, pons and midbraindthe ‘brain
stem DWI lesion score’. This comprises scores between 0 and 22,
with a score of 0 indicating the absence of visible posterior
circulation ischemia and a score of 22 indicating DWI restriction
in the entire brain stem. The number of arterial territories with
abnormal DWI was assessed at each brain stem level: 0e8 in the
medulla, 0e6 in the pons and 0e8 in the midbrain. Of the 29
patients included, the authors found that the DWI score was
able to predict the clinical outcome (favorable outcome defined
as mRS score 0e2) despite recanalization being achieved in 76%
of patients. The authors concluded that this scoring system may
be able to identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
Extensive brain stem damage may indicate a poor prognosis
regardless of recanalization success or failure. Conversely,
they suggest that patients with limited DWI lesions might
benefit from late reperfusion therapy.

Several studies have compared recanalization rates using
various thrombolytic agents, most commonly urokinase or tPA.
Although numbers are small in some studies and statistical
significance was not reached, tPA trends toward a more effective
recanalization agent.23 30e32 Schulte-Altedorneburg et al32 also
found a significantly higher bleeding rate for tPA than for
urokinase. In particular, the administration of high-dose tPA
(>80 mg) caused a significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage
compared with urokinase (46% vs 21%, p<0.01). The
neurological outcome was worse in patients with post-interventional
bleeding (p<0.001). The authors recommend a cut-off
point of 80 mg for the dosage of tPA.
The same group also recorded patterns of infarction following
intra-arterial therapy with and without successful recanalization.32 The occipital lobe, thalamus and the superior part of the
cerebellum were significantly more often affected by ischemic
lesions in the case of successful recanalization. This result
corresponds to the angiographic finding that occlusion of the
post-communicating segment of one or both posterior cerebral
arteries (PCAs) was frequently found with successful recanalization
but not with absent recanalization (39% vs 0%). Their
findings suggest that the successful recanalization by fibrinolytic
agents comes with the price of distal migration of thrombotic
material into the PCA, superior cerebellar arteries and perforators
branching from the pre-communicating segment of the PCA. The
authors suggest that mechanical thrombectomy may achieve
more effective recanalization with less distal embolization.
IAT VERSUS IVT: SOME CONTROVERSIAL FINDINGS
There is controversy in the stroke literature as to the optimal
treatment for patients with basilar artery occlusion. Critics of
IATclaim that procedural risks and expenses cannot currently be
justified.33 Proponents suggest higher rates of recanalization
with IAT and potentially lower rates of symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage.1 4 5 Indeed, transcranial Doppler monitoring
suggests recanalization in only 30% of cases of basilar artery
occlusion treated with IVT.34 Two principal studies have
attempted to compare IVT and intra-arterial therapyda metaanalysis
undertaken by Lindesberg and Mattle in 20068 and
a prospective multicenter registry-based trial, the Basilar Artery
International Cooperation Study (BASICS), performed in
2009.35
Lindesberg and Mattle8 compared the outcomes of basilar
artery occlusion in 76 patients treated with IVTand 344 patients
treated with IAT, with the following findings:
< The outcome for death or dependency was very similar
(78% (59/76) and 76% (260/344), respectively).
< Recanalization was achieved more frequently with IAT than
with IVT (225/344 (65%) vs 40/76 (53%), p¼0.05).
< Survival rates after IVT and IAT were similar (38/76 (50%)
and 154/344 (45%), respectively, p¼0.48).
< A total of 24% of patients treated with IAT and 22% treated
with IVT obtained favorable outcomes (p¼0.82). Favorable
outcome was defined as mRS score 0e2, Barthel Index
95e100 or GCS 5.
< The likelihood of a good outcome without recanalization was
very low (2%).
The authors concluded that recanalization occurs in more
than half of patients with basilar occlusion treated with IAT or
IVT and 45e55% of survivors regain functional independence.
The effect of IVT did not appear to be much different from that
of IAT.
However, this analysis had certain limitations. The IAT and
IVT group sizes were remarkably different and 50 of 76 patients
treated by IVT were drawn from an earlier study by Lindsberg
et al36 in which occlusion was diagnosed by the clinical
syndrome combined with time-of-flight MR angiography. MR
angiography is insensitive to slow and low residual flow and
may show discontinuity (skip sign) attributable to technical
reasons. It is therefore plausible that the basilar artery was either
completely or only partially occluded, with a potentially lifesaving
residual flow maintaining the perfusion of the brain stem
in the patients in the study by Lindsberg et al. Angiography
confirming occlusion was available in only 5 of 50 patients, so
this studydwhich provided most of the patients for the IVT
groupdcould easily have introduced bias into the meta-analysis.
The BASICS trial36 was a prospective multicenter nonrandomized
observational registry of 592 consecutive patients
who presented with an acute symptomatic and radiologicallyconfirmed basilar artery occlusion during a 5-year period. Patients
were divided into three groups according to the treatment they
received: (1) antithrombotic treatment only (antiplatelet drugs or
systemic anticoagulation, n¼183); (2) primary IVT including
subsequent IAT (n¼121); and (3) intra-arterial therapy (which
comprised thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, stenting or
a combination of these approaches, n¼288).
Stroke severity at the time of treatment was categorized as
severe (coma, locked-in state or tetraplegia, n¼347) or mild to
moderate (any deficit that was less than severe, n¼245). The
outcome was assessed at 1 month. A poor outcome was defined
as mRS score of 4 or 5 or death. For mild to moderate deficits,
comparison with anitithrombotic treatment showed that the
risk of a poor outcome after IVT (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60
to 1.45) was about the same as that after IAT (adjusted RR 1.29,
95% CI 0.97 to 1.72), but the outcome was worse after IAT than
after IVT (adjusted RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.23). For severe
deficits, comparison with anitithrombotic treatment showed
that there was a lower risk of a poor outcome after IVT
(adjusted RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01) or IAT (adjusted RR
0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02). Outcomes regarding rates of recanalization
and outcome of patients were similar after treatment
with IATand IVT (adjusted RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22). The
authors concluded that their results did not support unequivocal

superiority of IAT over IVT and encouraged clinicians to treat
patients who have acute symptomatic basilar occlusion and
a mild to moderate deficit with IVT.
However, several criticisms can be made of this study.
Importantly, patients in the IVT group had less severe strokes
and were treated earlier, indicating a bias toward the preferred
use of IVT in patients with shorter and less severe symptoms
and a bias toward a better outcome in the IVT group. The mean
initial National Institute of Health stroke scale score was 21 in
the IVT group and 25 in the IAT group, and 55% of patients in
the IVT group were treated within the first 3 h after symptom
onset compared with only 23% of the IAT group.
Furthermore, confounding factors were not measured or
controlled for. Thrombus volume, length of the occluded vessel
and the existence and degree of residual or collateral flow are all
known to have an impact on the ability to recanalize and on the
clinical outcome.22e24 However, in the BASICS registry the IVT
group did not include sufficient vascular imaging to control for
this.
It is also uncertain as to whether true basilar artery occlusion
or partial but collateralised stenosis or emboli causing only
a temporary occlusion were treated in the IVT group. This factor
may account for the relatively high recanalization rate of 67% in
the IVT group in the BASICS registry relative to published rates
of recanalization.34
Another important point is that 41 patients in the IVT group
were treated with a bridging approach (IVT followed by IAT),
but these patients were included in the IVT group alone with
regard to assessment of recanalization and outcome. This could
have had a significant impact on the results and could potentially
have altered the statistical significance if these patients
were included in an IAT/endovascular group.
If the potential biases described are borne in mind, it is difficult
to draw firm conclusions from the available data comparing
the delivery of thrombolytic agents. What is required is a trial
comparing IVT, IVT plus IATand IAT (including clot extraction
devices).
BRIDGING THERAPY
One of the major disadvantages of the intra-arterial approach is
the time loss to initiate the treatment. An attempt to overcome
this disadvantage has been to combine the intravenous route
with the intra-arterial access using the so-called ‘bridging’
concept. Furthermore, endovascular therapy is only offered in
a few institutionsdoften tertiary referral centersdso, if treatment
can be started early before transfer to these centers, the
outcome may be improved.
Eckert et al37 and Nagel et al38 have both performed studies
assessing outcomes in patients treated initially with an intravenous
bolus, then infusion of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor
antagonist abciximab (an initial bolus of 0.25 mg/kg followed by
0.125mg/kg/min for 12 h) followed by intra-arterial therapy
including tPA and, where appropriate, angioplasty with or
without stenting for underlying atherothrombotic lesions. In
the study by Eckert et al,37 half-dose intra-arterial tPA (median
20 mg) was used in the bridging group and full-dose intra-arterial
tPA (median 40 mg) was used in the control group. In the
study by Nagel et al,38 mechanical disruption of the thrombus
was also performed in both groups. Both studies demonstrated
improved rates of recanalization in the bridging groups as well as
improved survival compared with IAT alone (58e62% vs
25e32%), and higher rates of favorable outcome (mRS score
0e3) were seen in the bridging groups (35% vs 12.5e17%).
Although overall bleeding complications were greater in the
study by Eckert et al, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did
not differ significantly with a rate of 3e14%. These results are
intriguing and introduce a potentially useful protocol for care;
however, in both studies, patients in the bridging group were
more frequently treated with percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty/stent placement. This could have biased the results
and prevents firm conclusions on the bridging concept including
pre-intervention abciximab. Indeed, the results may reflect
the fact that angioplasty/stenting is potentially a very useful
technique in the treatment of atherthrombotic occlusions.
Pfefferkorn et al39 treated a small cohort of 16 patients
presenting with basilar occlusion with a standardized protocol
combining IVT with consecutive on-demand endovascular
mechanical thrombectomy. Seven of the 16 patients required
endovascular treatment because of persistent basilar artery
occlusion following systemic thrombolysis. Approximately half
of these patients had a good outcome using this regime: 44%
with no or mild deficit (mRS score 0e2) and 13% with
a moderate deficit (mRS score 3). Only one intracranial hemorrhage
occurred in a patient who had received IVT alone.
The same group have instituted a ‘drip, ship and retrieve’
cooperative treatment protocol in which thrombolysis was
initiated in a community hospital with simultaneous referral to
a central stroke center for endovascular mechanical recanalization
as required (n¼26), and compared the outcomes with
a group given IAT with or without tirofiban bridging between
2003 and 2005 (n¼26).7 The rate of symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage was 12% in the historical cohort and 8% in those
treated under the new protocol. Recanalization rates were
similar (92% in the historical cohort and 85% in those treated
with the new protocol); 38% of these had recanalization after
IVT alone. Functional outcome was better among those treated
with the new protocol, with more patients achieving a mRS
score of 2 (38% vs 12%, p¼0.03) and a mRS score of 3 (50% vs
23%, p¼0.04). ‘Drip, ship and retrieve’ appeared to be feasible
and safe in acute basilar artery occlusion. Patients appear to
benefit from initiation of IVT before transfer for endovascular
care. The speed of delivery, coupled with a ‘softening’ of
the thrombus prior to intervention, may prove effective. The
risk of intracerebral hemorrhage remains the largest potential
drawback, but results from this initial work suggest that this
risk may not be as significant as previously thought. Further
Key points
< A meta-analysis8 and a large prospective registry-based study
(BASICS)36 have compared IAT and IVT.
< While conclusions drawn in these studies suggest little
difference between the two strategies, flaws in study design
preclude making these conclusions.
< The meta-analysis8 group sizes were very different and MR
angiography (insensitive to slow flow) was used to assess the
IVT group.
< The BASICS study36 included patients with less severe
strokes in the IVT arm and these were treated earlier. In
addition, patients treated with a bridging approach were
included in the IVT group.
< A randomized trial would be useful to determine whether IAT
adds to improved clinical outcomes over IVT alone or in
combination with IVT.

approach.
MECHANICAL CLOT EXTRACTION
As the success of local thrombolysis in basilar thromboembolism
depends on the volume and composition of the clot, and since
thrombolysis can also be time-consuming and cause bleeding,
various investigators have assessed the use of mechanical
thrombectomy devices in the basilar artery. Most of the literature
pertaining to mechanical thrombectomy/thromboaspiration
features a small number of devices including MERCI40 and
the Penumbra aspiration catheter.41 Simple mechanical clot
disruption42 and several other devices including the Possis
Angiojet catheter43 and the Solitaire stent retriever44 have also
been used in the posterior circulation.
Lutsep et al40 extracted data on basilar artery occlusion from
both MERCI and Multi MERCI trials. Patients received treatment
up to 8 h after symptom onset. Recanalization was
determined after retriever use and adjunctive therapy. Mortality
and good outcomes (mRS score 0e3) were determined at
90 days in patients who were recanalized and not recanalized.
Recanalization occurred in 21 of 27 (78%) patients. Mortality
was 44% and good outcomes were seen in 41%. Eighteen
patients with basilar occlusions were included in the largest
series using the Penumbra aspiration catheter.41 44 Although
these series suggest recanalization rates of approximately 85%,
data specific to the vertebrobasilar system were not separately
published.
Mayer et al43assessed the use of the Possis Angiojet catheter in
12 patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion. Combined
treatment with the Angiojet and additional fibrinolysis or
angioplasty resulted in a recanalization rate of 100%. Three
symptomatic and two asymptomatic hemorrhages were
detected by CT. Five of the 12 patients died; 50% of patients
obtained a moderate to excellent outcome (mRS score 0e3). The
authors concluded that this device has the potential to increase
the recanalization rate, especially in cases of extensive thrombosis
, and thus to improve patient outcomes. Encouraging
results have also been obtained using the Solitaire stent retriever
(figure 1).45 46 A 90% recanalization rate was achieved in one
series that included nine basilar occlusions among 40 patients45
and, in another series,46 15 of 56 patients. In the latter series
a favorable outcome rate (mRS score 0e2) of 33% was achieved,
lower than that seen in anterior circulatory strokes in the same
series. Proponents of the Solitaire stent retriever suggest that it
has several advantages over other interventional techniquesd
not only is there a very high rate of successful recanalization,
but implantation of the stent retriever typically produces
immediate recanalization.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Although there is a lack of randomized data, what is clear is
that, although variable, basilar occlusion can be catastrophic and
the outcome is better in patients who are treated with recanalization
therapy. Patients with more distal occlusions of embolic
etiology and with poor collateral flow do badly without treatment.
Large clot loads are difficult to treat, even with IAT, and
mechanical methods of extraction/aspiration may be needed to
facilitate recanalization. Patients with a depressed level of
consciousness (although a marker of poor prognosis) may still do
well with treatment despite the presentation. Treating patients
early is optimal, although delayed treatment may still be
successful and exclusion from treatment based strictly on timing
is not warranted. Perhaps assessment of pretreatment infarct
core with diffusion-weighted MR imaging or CTASI will be
a useful tool in selecting for aggressive therapy those patients
who present late or who have clinically severe strokes. We
suggest that the recanalization rates of IAT and mechanical
devices are generally higher relative to IVT, and it is not unreasonable
to assert that, for acutely unwell patients with poor
prognostic indicators and heavy clot loads, endovascular therapy
is currently the only way to achieve effective recanalization
satisfactorily in the majority of patients.
Key points
< A bridging approach of intravenous abciximab (glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitor) prior to intra-arterial treatment of tPA has
shown some clinical outcome benefit over IAT alone in nonrandomized
trials.37 38
< Confounding factors limit firm conclusions as it is difficult to
quantify the potential effect of angioplasty in the bridging
arms.
< A ‘drip, ship and retrieve’ regimen of initial IVT in a community
hospital followed by IAT in an interventional neuroradiology
center has also demonstrated additional benefit over IAT
alone.39

CONCLUSIONS
Basilar artery occlusion is a heterogeneous condition with variable
clinical severity; however, it can be fatal. Outcomes are
improved in those who undergo recanalization. Many other
factors influence the outcome including severity of presentation,
site of occlusion, clot load, degree of collateral flow, core infarct
distribution, timing of therapy, agent used for recanalization and
dose of thrombolytic agent. This makes comparison of different
therapeutic modalities difficult and probably renders firm
conclusions as to the best mode of therapy (IAT vs IVT, IAT plus
IVT, mechanical extraction vs thrombolytic, or mechanical
extraction plus thrombolytic) impossible based on current data.
It is probably true that all methods should be available to tailor
treatment for individual patients as part of multidisciplinary
care. With increasing use of mechanical clot extraction devices,
much of the data we currently have pertaining to treatment of
this condition no longer reflects current practice in many institutions.
As the use of mechanical clot extraction devices
increases, outcomes following the use of this technology should
be assessed on a large scale. Initial results with these devices are
encouraging. A randomized trial could help to clarify some
points and, if therapies are compared, we could get closer to the
claim that one treatment is superior to another. However, the
relatively small numbers of patients, multiple confounding
factors and lack of clinical equipoise are barriers to the development
of such a trial and it is unlikely that a study of this
quality will be available in the near future.
