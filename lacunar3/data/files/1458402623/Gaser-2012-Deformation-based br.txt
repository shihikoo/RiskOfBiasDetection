Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based morphometry provides in vivo evidence for macro-structural plasticity of
the brain. Experiments on small animals using automated morphometric methods usually require expensive measurements
with ultra-highfield dedicated animal MRI systems. Here, we developed a novel deformation-based
morphometry (DBM) tool for automated analyses of rat brain images measured on a 3-Tesla clinical whole
body scanner with appropriate coils. A landmark-based transformation of our customized reference brain into
thecoordinatesofthewidelyusedratbrainatlasfromPaxinosandWatson(PaxinosAtlas)guaranteesthecomparability
of results to other studies. For cross-sectional data, we warped images onto the reference brain using the
low-dimensional nonlinear registration implemented in the MATLAB software package SPM8. For the analysis of
longitudinal data sets, we chose high-dimensional registrations of all images of one data set to the first baseline
image which facilitate the identification of more subtle structural changes. Because all deformations were finally
used to transform the data into the space of the Paxinos Atlas, Jacobian determinants could be used to estimate
absolute local volumes of predefined regions-of-interest. Pilot experiments were performed to analyze brain
structural changes due to aging or photothrombotically-induced cortical stroke. The results support the utility
of DBM based on commonly available clinical whole-body scanners for highly sensitive morphometric studies
on rats.

Introduction
Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based morphometric
studies in humans have shown that changes of the brain's morphology
correlate with behavioral abilities, learning, diseases and age (for
review see: Fields, 2011; Mietchen and Gaser, 2009; Raz and Rodrigue,
2006). Findings from this field of research have provided new and
surprising insights into how the brain reorganizes under native and
pathological conditions, and may be highly relevant for the improvement
of therapeutic interventions for aging- or disease-induced disabilities.
However, the cellular mechanisms underlying macro-structural plasticity
in the human brain are largely unknown because their investigation
would require post-mortem or biopsy tissue samples. To bridge this gap,
the transfer of human study designs to animal experiments is urgently
required.
Morphometry of animal brain magnetic resonance (MR) images is
not straightforward regardless of whether the analysis strategy is
region-of-interest (ROI) based or ROI independent. The ROI-based
manual outlining of individual brain structures enables the estimation
of absolute volumes but requires well-reasoned and time-consuming
area demarcation, and the outlining protocols may not be compatible
between different laboratories (Foldi et al., 2010; Hasegawa et al.,
2010; Henke et al., 2008; Nagel et al., 2004; Sawiak et al., 2009a;
Schubert et al., 2008, 2009). Unfortunately, manual approaches fail if
the volumes of selected structures differ partially by small amounts.
The detection of such diffuse and spatially distributed volume changes
over the whole brain requires more sensitive and preferably automated
methods. For this purpose, two MR image intensity-based techniques
have been developed enabling the quantitative estimation of structural
changes. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is based on automatic
segmentation of the brain in gray matter, white matter and ventricles,
and therefore requires high contrast between tissue borders. In small rodents
, which are largely preferred for animal experiments on mammals,
this is only achievable using ultra-high field MRI systems (preferably
>9 T) (Li et al., 2009) or unfeasibly long acquisition times (Sawiak et
al., 2009b). In contrast to VBM, deformation-based morphometry
(DBM) detects structural differences independent of sharp tissue borders
by analysis of deformations needed to match one brain onto a reference
brain by nonlinear registration (Ashburner et al., 1998; Gaser et al.,

1999). Therefore, DBM might be preferable for morphometry of brain
structures with lower contrast between different tissues.
Thefirst aim of the present study was to establish a DBM tool for rat
brainsmeasured on a 3-Tesla clinical whole body scanner, whereby–by
using appropriate coils–we are able to generate images with adequate
spatial resolution and tissue contrast in short measurement times
(Herrmann et al., 2011). Although DBM was established for mice measured
on ultra-high field animal MRI systems (Badea et al., 2010;
Carroll et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2008; Lerch et al., 2008; Maheswaran et
al., 2009; Mercer et al., 2009; Nieman et al., 2007; Seminowicz et al.,
2009; Spring et al., 2010; Verma et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2011; Zhang et
al., 2010),the use of clinical scanners for animal studies holds important
advantages. First, well-established optimized clinical protocols with
sequences that sometimes do not have corresponding counterparts
on animal scanners in combination with the lower field strengths
with all their benefits on T1 and T2 relaxation times bring the experiments
closer to human imaging. Secondly, the large bore size facilitates
easier access to the animal and provides more space for equipment
necessary for anesthesia supply or animalfixation (Herrmann et al.,
2011). Finally, for most researchers, clinical scanners are more easily
available than expensive ultra-highfield animal MRI systems. The second
aim of the study was to implement the advantages of both the ROI-based
strategy to estimate absolute volumes and the ROI-independent strategy
of qualitative brain morphology to analyze diffuse volume changes which
works within the standardized coordinates of the Paxinos Atlas.
For DBM, we adopted a tool that we have previously developed for
use with human data (Gaser et al., 2001). A customized rat reference
brain was created and landmark-based transformed into the space of
the Paxinos Atlas with predefined ROIs. The transformation of deformations
into the space of the Paxinos Atlas enables the estimation of
absolute local volumes. In a pilot study, we analyzed whole brain and
cortical volumes of young adult (3 months) and aged (26 months)
male rats in a cross-sectional design and validated the approach by
comparing the automatically generated data with results of manual
volume estimation. For the detection of more subtle volume changes,
we pair-wisely registered longitudinally acquired images of one data
set to the first baseline image. The intra-pair deformations are then
transformed into the space of the Paxinos Atlas using normalization parameters
obtained with the baseline image. We tested this approach on
animals with photothrombotically-induced cortical stroke and found a
pattern of progressive volume changes in remote non-lesion areas
which correlated with recent histologic, physiologic and behavioral
findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating
high sensitivity of DBM in combination with rats measured on
a clinical whole body scanner. This novel DBM tool could facilitate the
analyses of macro-structural brain plasticity undertaken by other research
groups.
Materials and methods
The experiments were performed with male Han–Wist rats in adherence
with local government requirements and according to approved
guidelines. To compare the macro-structure of young adult and aged
brains in a cross-sectional design, MRI was performed on one group of
3-month-old rats (n=10) and on a second group of 26-month-old rats
(n=15). For longitudinal analysis ofstroke-induced brain tissue shrinkage
,five consecutive MRI measurements were performed on a group
of young adult rats, respectively, one week before (baseline measurement
) as well as one, two, four and eight weeks following cortical
photothrombotic lesion induction (lesioned: n=8; controls: n=8;
age at lesion induction: 3 months).
Photothrombotic lesion
Photothrombotic lesions including the primary and secondary
motor cortex (M1, M2) as well as parts of the primary somatosensory
cortex of the fore- and hindlimbs (S1FL, S1HL) were induced as described
previously (Schmidtetal.,2011 ). In brief, rats were anesthetized
with isoflurane (2.5% in oxygen), the skin above the skull was
incised and afiber-optic bundle (aperture: 3.0 mm; light source: Schott
KL1500) waspositioned 0.5 mmanterior to bregma and 3.7 mmlateral
to midline. During thefirst minute of illumination (whole illumination
time: 20 min), the photosensitive dye rose bengal (Aldrich Chemie,
1.3 mg/100 mg bodyweight) was injected through the tail vein. Body
temperature was controlled rectally and held constant at 37 °C.
After illumination, the wounds were sutured and animals were placed
in a warm environment for approximately 30 min before returning to
home cages with free access to food and water. Control animals received
the same procedure without injection of the photosensitive dye.
MRI acquisition protocols
Rat brain MRI was performed on a clinical 3 T whole body scanner
(Magnetom TIM Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) as
previously described (Herrmann et al., 2011). For cross-sectional analysis
of age-specific brain volume changes, a two -module multi-functional
8-channel surface coil (CPC coil, Noras MRI products GmbH, Höchberg,
Germany) was used. Measurements for longitudinal analysis of
stroke-induced brain volume changes were performed using a dedicated
rat head coil with a linearly polarized Litz coil volume resonator design
(Doty Scientific Inc., Columbia, SC, USA). Anesthesia of freely breathing
animals was provided by isoflurane (1.7% in oxygen, 1.5 l/min).
T2-weighted images were obtained using a 3D SPACE (Sampling Perfection
with Application-Optimized Contrasts Using Different Flip Angle
Evolutions) sequence (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with
an isotropic resolution of 0.33 mm3 (matrix 192×130×96, FoV

R
=352 ms/2500 ms, flip
angle mode‘T2var’, echo spacing of 10.7 ms, turbo factor of 67 and Partial
Fourier of 7/8 in both phase encode directions). While the CPC coil
measurements were performed using three repetitions each consisting
of two averages with a total acquisition time T
A
=42 min, the improved
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the Doty coil enabled a protocol
with two repetitions (one average) with T
A
=14 min.
Generation of the reference brain
Because we obtained our T2-weighted images on a clinical 3 T
scanner, these images might differ in tissue contrast, spatial resolution
and SNR from data acquired on high field scanners. Thus, we could
not use any existing rat reference brain and the creation of a customized
reference brain was mandatory. We used 176 rats (69 Rcc–Wist, 107
Han–Wist, age range 3–6 months, mean age 3.64 months) to create a
customized reference brain.We used two different ratstrainsto provide
a mixed template for future studies that can be used for both Rcc–Wist
as well as Han–Wist rats. Another reason to use two strains was to have
a large, representative number of rats that are used to create the template.
However, the differences between both strains might be rather
small because both are substrains from Wistar rats.
The generation of this initial reference brain involved the following
steps:
1. Selection of one representative rat brain as reference for initial affine
spatial transformation using 12 parameters (Fig. 1A)
2. Manual drawing of a brain mask to exclude non-brain regions from
spatial transformation
3. Affine transformation of all brains to the brain from step 1 (Fig. 1A)
4. Calculation of the average of the affine transformed brains to be
subsequently used as new reference brain
5. Nonlinear spatial transformation of all brains to the new reference
image from step 4
6. Calculation of average of nonlinearly transformed brains to create
a new reference brain (Fig. 1B)

image of Fig. 1
As nonlinear transformation we used the default spatial normalization
implemented in the MATLAB software package SPM8 with the following
parameters: spatial cut-off 1.5 mm; 24 iterations; regularization of registration
0.1; voxel size for writing 0.2×0.2×0.2 mm3; image and template
smoothing with FWHM of 0.8 mm; template weighting with the
manually defined brain mask. For affine as well as nonlinear transformation
a Gauss–Newton optimization was used with least-squares as
similarity metric.
This initial reference brain represents the average of 176 brains
while providing reasonable spatial details due to the use of a nonlinear
spatial transformation. However, the reference space is now primarily
defined by the first selected reference brain and is not comparable to
other atlases. In order to provide a standardized reference atlas, we
made use of the Paxinos Atlas, which is also available as single slice images
in JPEG format (Paxinos and Watson, 2005). This atlas is widely
used and guarantees standardization and comparability of results. In
order to use the Paxinos Atlas, we applied the following procedure:
1. Thresholding and morphological erosion of Paxinos Atlas image slices
by one pixel to enlarge borders between regions and provide clear delineation
between regions (e.g. regions should be unconnected after
erosion)
2. Manual filling of regions slice-by-slice with predefined intensity
values for each hemisphere to differentiate between regions
(Fig. 2B)
3. Morphological dilation of edited slices by one pixel to refill borders
between regions (Fig. 2C)
4. Filling existing gaps between thicker slices with duplicates
5. Combination of all processed slices to a 3D volume with final
in-plane resolution of 0.025 mm and a slice thickness of 0.12 mm
Because of the time-consuming and demanding nature of the task,
not all regions of the original Paxinos Atlas were used and manually
filled. However, all regions in the cortical band were covered, while
most of the smaller regions around the midline were not used because
of their small size.
In order to transform the initial reference brain into the space of the
Paxinos Atlas, we applied a landmark-based thin-plate spline warping
(Bookstein, 1989). First, we manually defined 118 corresponding landmarks
in both images. Secondly, a thin-plate spline warping was applied
to nonlinearly transform the reference brain into the space of
the Paxinos Atlas using the Minc-software Register (http://www.bic.
mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/MINC).
After thisfinal nonlinear registration, the initial reference brain is
transformed into the space of the Paxinos Atlas and can now be used
as standard reference brain for all rat brains. Finally, the location of
the bregma ±0 in coronal slices was set as origin.
DBM
In order to analyze rat brain structure, we used a DBM approach that
we have previously developed for use with human brain data. DBM is a
useful technique to detect structural differences over the entire brain
since it analyzes positional differences between every voxel and a reference
brain. The idea is to use a nonlinear registration to deform one
brain onto a reference brain. After this registration, the morphological
differences between both brains are minimized and the deformations
now encode information about these differences. The Jacobian determinant
can be finally used to calculate local volume changes at every
voxel. Our DBM approach was validated in an earlier study by comparing
the deformationfields and its Jacobian determinant with manually
traced ventricular volumes (Gaser et al., 2001).
The accuracy (how detailed will a DBM approach work) mainly
depends on the dimensionality of the nonlinear registration that is
used to deform the brains. We used two nonlinear registration techniques
that differ in terms of dimensionality to provide appropriate
approaches for cross-sectional as well as for longitudinal data. For
cross-sectional data, we applied the low-dimensional nonlinear registration
that is also used in SPM8 as the default registration to spatially
normalize data to a reference brain (Ashburner and Friston, 1999).
We modified the parameters to work with the deviating dimensions
of rat brains with the settings that were described in Generation of
the reference brainsection: spatial cut-off 1.5 mm; 24 iterations; regularization
of registration 0.1; voxel size for writing 0.2×0.2×0.2 mm3;
image and template smoothing with FWHM of 0.8 mm; template
weighting with the manually defined brain mask.
For longitudinal data, more subtle changes are expected. Therefore,
we chose a high-dimensional registration with more detailed deformations
(Ashburner et al., 1999). This registration allows the identification
of more subtle structures with greater precision. A prerequisite for longitudinal
data is that all images of one data set are rigidly registered to
the first baseline image. After this positional correction, the pair-wise
deformations are obtained between all subsequent images of one data
set to its baseline. Finally, all intra-pair deformations are nonlinearly
transformed to the Paxinos Atlas using the normalization parameters
obtained with the baseline image.
Finally, the Jacobian determinant of the deformations can be used
to calculate local volume changes. Because all deformations were
transformed to the Paxinos Atlas, this atlas can also be used to estimate
local volumes of predefined ROIs. That means that for all regions

defined in our Paxinos Atlas, region-wise volume changes can be estimated
and analyzed.
Cavalieri volume estimation
To validate our rat DBM approach, we performed a manual Cavalieri
volume estimation on MR images of 10 young adult (3 months) and 15
aged (26 months) rats using the Image J software. By using a 1750 μm
size counting frame for the whole brain and a 840 μmsizecounting
frame for the left or right whole cortex, between 948 and 1161 grid
points from 27 to 30 coronal sections (block advance: 900 μm) and between
488 and 608 grid points from 16 to 19 coronal sections were
counted for the whole brain and the whole cortex, respectively, which
provided coefficient of error estimates ofb0.1.
Statistical analysis
Voxel-wise analysis of volume changes over time was performed
within SPM8 with a repeated measure ANOVA. Only results exceeding
a threshold of pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons using
family-wise error [FWE]) were reported. Results were overlaid onto
the average of all normalized anatomical images. We applied a t-test
to investigate an interaction between time and group by testing for a
volume decrease between the first and last time point in the lesion
group compared to the control group. Region-wise analysis was
obtained using SPSS at a threshold of pb0.05.
Results
Cross-sectional analysis
To validate our DBM approach, we determined the volume of
young adult and aged rat brains using the cross-sectional design. As
shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, whole brains of 26-month-old rats
(3058±22 mm3, n=15) were approximately 12% larger than brains
of 3-month-old rats (2741±34 mm3, n=10, pb0.05) and showed a
slight asymmetry in favor of the right hemisphere (pb0.05). The cerebral
cortex was chosen as the model structure to illustrate regional analysis.
Aged rats showed bi-hemispherically increased cortical volumes of
around 6% (~20 mm3) compared to young adult rats, with the same
asymmetry as found for the whole brain (pb0.05). Separation into
iso- and allocortex (allocortex exclusively constituting the hippocampus),
representing phylogenetically new and old parts of the cortex, respectively
, revealed that the volume increases as well as the asymmetry
resulted mainly from the growth of phylogenetically old allocortical
structures. However, cortical volume normalized to the whole brain
volume demonstrated that the percent amount of cortical tissue was
decreased in aged animals for both iso- and allocortical regions.
To test the reliability of our DBM approach, we compared the automatically
determined volumes with results from manual volumetry
determined using Cavalieri estimation. Linear regression analysis of
both whole brain data (r=0.98; pb0.0001) and regional data of left
and right cortices (r=0.92; pb0.0001) showed highly significant
values (Fig. 4).
Longitudinal analysis
The longitudinal tool enables us to analyze more subtle and diffuse
volume changes that are not restricted to predefined regions. Here, we
screened brains to find areas with tissue shrinkage after righthemispheric
cortical lesioning. The lesion damaged the motor cortex
(M1, M2) and parts of the fore- and hindlimb primary somatosensory
cortex (S1FL, S1HL). At a threshold of pb0.001 (FWE corrected), both
hemispheres showed progressive regional tissue shrinkage (Table 2).

Parts of the corpus callosum, the hippocampus, the temporal association
cortex, the olfactory tubercle, the insular cortex and anterior parts of the
basal ganglia were affected ipsilesionally, whereas more posterior areas
of the basal ganglia were affected bilaterally.
Fig. 5illustrates an example of the time-course of volume changes in
the ipsilesional hippocampus. Following initial swelling, progressive
tissue shrinkage was found in caudal parts of the hippocampus. The
volume decreased most strongly between 7 and 14 days following
lesion induction and this shrinkage was preserved up to the end of
the investigation period on day 56. In contrast, the control animals
exhibited a steady volume increase throughout the investigation period,
attributed to the continuous growth of the young adult rodent brain.
Discussion
We present here a novel general DBM approach applicable to rat
brain MR images acquired from standard clinical 3 T scanners. This
tool allows automatic detection of diffuse and spatially distributed subtle
volume changes in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal designs. In
order to enable standardization and comparability of the results, data
are transformed into the Paxinos Atlas reference space (Paxinos and
Watson, 2005). This atlas also permits estimations of absolute volumes
in ROIs that are defined for this atlas.

To the best of our knowledge, our presented approach is the first
that is capable of analyzing rodent data acquired on a standard clinical
scanner in an automatic manner. Because dedicated ultra-highfield
animal MRI systems are expensive and not easily accessible for
many research groups, the use of a standard clinical scanner offers
many potential applications. One major limitation of the lower field
strength, however, is the smaller SNR of the data. Using smaller coils
and optimized sequences, the SNR can be increased by up to a factor
of 3, which allows acquisition of data with reasonable image quality
(Herrmann et al., 2011). Furthermore, the lower SNR can be partially
compensated by application of a DBM technique that does not require
large image contrasts between tissues compared to VBM methods that
rely on segmentation.
The use of a reference atlas is a prerequisite to automatically analyze
imaging data. The transformation to an atlas enables standardization
and comparability to other studies. We have used the Paxinos Atlas,
which is the most common atlas for rats and provides many predefined
ROIs. Here, we automated ROI-based morphometry by normalization of
brain MR images to the Paxinos reference space that contains the definition
of structural borders. By inverting the normalization parameters,
prior defined area-borders of the reference space were transferred onto
each rat brain. This approach benefits from the resolution of normalization
algorithms and therefore exceeds the general accuracy of manual
approaches, particularly in areas with lower image contrast. This
ROI-based approach has previously been validated by comparing the
deformation fields and its Jacobian determinant with manually traced
ventricular volumes (Gaser et al., 2001).
In order to validate our approach we have used manual Cavalieri
volume estimation and were able to demonstrate a good agreement
between these manually derived values and our automatically estimated
volumes. However, for future applications registration accuracy might be
further increased by the use of advanced template creation approaches
that also provide an unbiased average template brain (Kovacevic et al.,
2005).ForourcurrenttemplatewehaveuseddifferentWistarratsto
provide a mixed template that can be used for both Rcc-Wist and
Han–Wist rats. The use of Wistar rats might induce bias in the creation
of our template. However, the rats used here are both sub-strains from
Wistar rats and the differences between these sub-strains should be
rather small. In the future, advanced techniques might help in creating
unbiased templates (Ashburner, 2007; Kovacevic et al., 2005)tocover
also further strains (Nie et al., in press).
In our cross-sectional study, we found a 12% increase in brain volume
in aged rats when compared to younger animals, confirming results of
previous MRI-based studies which in a manual (Delatour et al., 2006;
Oberg et al., 2008; von Kienlin et al., 2005) or automatic manner
(Maheswaran et al., 2009) also determined a linearly increasing volume
of the rodent brain during lifespan. In contrast to humans, continuous
brain growth in rodents is facilitated by simultaneous expansion of the
neurocranium (Sandner et al., 2010). Furthermore, we confirmed results
of histological studies that showed rat brain asymmetry (Diamond et al.,
1975; Galaburda et al., 1986; Kolb et al., 1982; Rosen et al., 1991, 1993).
This anatomic asymmetry is suggested to be an expression of lateralized
function (Denenberg, 1983; Rogers, 2006; Sherman and Galaburda,
1984) and can be modulated by practice (Diamond et al., 1987;
Dowling et al., 1982). Collectively, the results from our cross-sectional
analysis revealed an age-dependent pattern with macro-structural
changes of the rat brain, which strongly suggests that ontological
features of rodent brain growth should be considered in animal
models of age-dependent neurological diseases in humans.
To clarify the causal link between brain structure and behavior,
longitudinal measurements are necessary. It has been shown that
memorizing for an examination (Draganski et al., 2006) or learning
a sensomotory skill is accompanied by temporal transient gray matter
expansions in young (Draganski et al., 2004) and aged people (Boyke
et al., 2008). These changes peak during the initial 7 days of the learning
phase and regress during continued training (Driemeyer et al., 2008).
Such a time-course favors rapidly adjusting neuronal systems like spine
and synapse turnover as the underlying mechanisms for learninginduced
gray matter increases (Trachtenberg et al., 2002). Finally,
MRI-based morphometry revealed that both functional plasticity and a
structural form of macroscopic brain plasticity are important in processing
of information in dynamic networks according to novel informational
demands and learning. Longitudinal functional measurements indicate
that the functional system involved in recovery may display a great
inter-individual variability (Dong et al., 2006; Koski et al., 2004).
However, findings based on functional measurements are limited to
specific networks activated by the task performed during the experiment.
Structural measurements as employed here allow a more global
view and might help to predict gains of specific rehabilitation strategies
(Lindenberg et al., 2010; Schaechter et al., 2009; Schiemanck et al.,
2008; Stinear et al., 2007).
Using our longitudinal approach, we analyzed rat brains for secondary
volume changes that were induced by a lesion affecting M1, M2 as well as
parts of the S1FL and S1HL cortex. We found a pattern of progressive
tissue shrinkage in remote areas that were not primarily affected by the
infarct. Most significantly, for gray matter we found time-dependent
changes in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Changes initially started with
swelling followed by secondary shrinkage of the tissue. It remains
unclear which physiological changes are responsible for the volume
alterations in the hippocampus and to what extent this influences
the improvement of forelimb function after a stroke incident. However,
the hippocampal formation appears to be involved in the compensation
of impaired functions as well as learning of new strategies to cope with
the functional deficit (Chozick, 1983).
The major future challenge is tounderstand the cellular mechanisms
linking macroscopic plasticity measured with MRI in healthy and diseased
brains with behavioral consequences. Our approach provides a
versatile and valuable tool for research on brain morphology using
rats – currently the best animal model for studying the sensory-motor
system (Cenci et al., 2002) – in combination with a standard clinical
3 T scanner.
