1956
Ischemic stroke is a common disease with high morbidity 
and mortality. Impaired cellular ion homeostasis causes 
ischemic neuroglial death.1 Glutamate-stimulated, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor–dependent perturbation of Na+ and Ca2+
homeostasis is a well-known contributor to ischemia-induced 
brain damage,1 but targeting of this pathway has limited 
neuroprotective efficacy in humans.2 Derangements in other 
N-methyl-D-aspartate–independent ion transport pathways 
also contribute to ischemic brain damage.3,4 Genetic or pharmacological
blockade of voltage-gated K+ channels,5 of the 
acid-sensing ion channel 1a,3 and of the sulfonylurea receptor 
1–transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel complex6
have also been shown to be neuroprotective, suggesting their 
potential as novel therapeutic targets.
Ischemia-induced stimulation of the bumetanide-sensitive 
Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) has been demonstrated to 
play an important role in the pathophysiology of experimental 
stroke, leading to cellular Na+ overload, cytotoxic edema, and 
necrotic and apoptotic cell death.7,8 However, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying NKCC1 activation in ischemic stroke 
Background and Purpose—WNK kinases, including WNK3, and the associated downstream Ste20/SPS1-related prolinealanine
–rich protein kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive 1 (OSR1) kinases, comprise an important signaling 
cascade that regulates the cation-chloride cotransporters. Ischemia-induced stimulation of the bumetanide-sensitive 
Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of experimental stroke, but the 
mechanism of its regulation in this context is unknown. Here, we investigated the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 pathway as a 
regulator of NKCC1 stimulation and their collective role in ischemic brain damage.
Method—Wild-type WNK3 and WNK3 knockout mice were subjected to ischemic stroke via transient middle cerebral 
artery occlusion. Infarct volume, brain edema, blood brain barrier damage, white matter demyelination, and neurological 
deficits were assessed. Total and phosphorylated forms of WNK3 and SPAK/OSR1 were assayed by immunoblotting and 
immunostaining. In vitro ischemia studies in cultured neurons and immature oligodendrocytes were conducted using the 
oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation method.
Results—WNK3 knockout mice exhibited significantly decreased infarct volume and axonal demyelination, less cerebral 
edema, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery compared with WNK3 wild-type mice subjected to middle cerebral artery 
occlusion. The neuroprotective phenotypes conferred by WNK3 knockout were associated with a decrease in stimulatory 
hyperphosphorylations of the SPAK/OSR1 catalytic T-loop and of NKCC1 stimulatory sites Thr203/Thr207/Thr212, as well as 
with decreased cell surface expression of NKCC1. Genetic inhibition of WNK3 or small interfering RNA knockdown of 
SPAK/OSR1 increased the tolerance of cultured primary neurons and oligodendrocytes to in vitro ischemia.
Conclusions—These data identify a novel role for the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 signaling pathway in ischemic 
neuroglial injury and suggest the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 kinase pathway as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection after 
ischemic stroke. (Stroke. 2015;46:1956-1965. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.008939.)

Begum et al WNK3-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 in Ischemic Stroke 1957
are not known. The Cl−-sensing WNK (with no lysine) and 
the Ste20/SPS1-related proline-alanine–rich protein kinase/
oxidative stress responsive 1 (SPAK/OSR1) serine-threonine 
kinases comprise an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway
that regulates the activities of NKCC1 and multiple other 
ion transporters and channels to control cell volume and 
epithelial ion transport.9–13 WNK kinases, including WNK3, 
associate with and activate SPAK/OSR1 by phosphorylation 
of its T-loop at Thr233 and Thr185. Activated SPAK/OSR1, in 
turn, stimulates NKCC1 activity by directly phosphorylating 
NKCC1 at multiple N-terminal threonines (Thr), including 
Thr203/Thr207/Thr212.10 The role of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling
in regulation of the related thiazide-sensitive Na+-Clcotransporter
and furosemide-sensitive NKCC2 during renal 
epithelial NaCl and K+ homeostasis has been well characterized.14,15 However, the function of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling
in the brain is essentially unknown.
WNK3 is a particularly compelling regulatory kinase candidate
of NKCC1, given its abundant expression in brain,16–18
its physical association with NKCC1,19 and the potent inhibitory
effect of catalytically inactive WNK3 on NKCC1 in 
vitro.17,20,21 We hypothesized that inhibition of WNK-SPAK/
OSR1 signaling might prevent the phosphorylation required 
for NKCC1 activation and thereby reduce NKCC1-dependent 
cerebral injury after ischemic stroke. Our experimental 
approach incorporated genetic knockdown of each component 
of the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 pathway in in vitro and in vivo 
models of ischemia. We found inhibition of WNK3-SPAK/
OSR1–dependent signaling protects neurons and oligodendrocytes
against injury and death by reducing ischemia-induced 
phosphoactivation and membrane expression of NKCC1.
Methods
Animals
WNK3 (C57Bl/6J) transgenic and NKCC1 (SV129/Black swiss) transgenic
mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12-hour 
light/12-hour dark cycle with standard mouse diet and water ad libitum. 
The mice were used for study at ages 2 to 3 months. All studies were 
in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals from the US Department of Health and 
Human Services and were approved by the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Genetic Analysis of WNK3 Insertional Knockout 
Mice
Female WNK3−/− and male WNK3Y/− knockout (KO) mice were generated
from the  embryonic stem cell line RRJ530 (Bay Genomics) 
by the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers at the University 
of California-Davis (mmrrc.ucdavis.edu), as described in the onlineonly Data Supplement. Immunoblot analysis with a specific anti-
WNK3 antibody22 confirmed the absence of WNK3 protein in 
the brain of WNK3 KO mice (Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). WNK3 KO mice exhibited normal phenotypes, which 
are consistent with previous reports on the normal electrolyte balance 
and grossly normal phenotypes of unstressed WNK3 KO mice.23,24
Sequencing of Mouse WNK3 cDNA
Mouse WNK3 cDNA from brain and kidney was polymerase chain 
reaction amplified as overlapping cDNA fragments, purified from 1% 
agarose gel and sequenced. Tissue distribution of WNK3 transcripts 
(Figure IA and IB online-only Data Supplement) and genotyping of 
WNK3 KO mice are described in the Materials and Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Reperfusion
Adult WNK3 WT (female WNK+/+ and male WNKY/+), adult WNK3
KO (female WNK3−/− and male WNK3Y/−), and adult male NKCC1 WT 
or KO mice (NKCC1+/+ and NKCC1−/− mice) originally developed 
by Flagella et al,25 each weighing ≈25 to 30 g at the ages of 2 to 3 
months, were used in this study. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced 
by 60-minute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, as previously 
described26 and detailed description is provided in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Neurological Function Analysis
Sensorimotor neurological deficit after surgery was evaluated in each 
mouse by a validated neurological function deficit scoring analysis as 
described in detail by Belayev et al,27 according to the following scale: 
0=no observable deficit; 1=forelimb flexion; 2=forelimb flexion and 
decreased resistance to lateral push; 3=forelimb flexion, decreased resistance
to lateral push and unilateral circling; and 4=forelimb flexion 
and impaired or absent ambulation.
Brain Infarction Volume and Cerebral Edema 
Measurements
At 24-hour reperfusion, mice were anesthetized with 5% halothane 
and then decapitated as described.28 Coronal brain tissue slices 
(2 mm) were stained for 15 minutes at 37ºC with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride monohydrate (TTC; Sigma, St Louis, MO) 
in PBS solution. Infarction volume was calculated as described.28
The extent of hemispheric swelling was calculated using the equation
: volume of ipsilateral hemisphere−volume of contralateral hemisphere
)/volume of contralateral hemisphere. In addition, in a different 
cohort of mice, brain edema was determined by brain water content 
measurement as described previously.8 Briefly, the ipsilateral and 
contralateral hemispheres were dissected and the wet weight of the 
tissue was measured. The tissue was dried at 120°C for 24 hours. The 
hemispheric water content was calculated as the difference between 
wet and dry weights and expressed as a percentage of wet weight.
Primary Cortical Neuron Cultures
Embryonic day 14 to 16 pregnant mice were anesthetized with 5% 
isoflurane and euthanized as described previously.8 Fetuses were 
removed and the cortices dissected in ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt 
solution. The tissues were treated with 0.5 mg/mL trypsin at 37°C for 
25 minutes. The cells were centrifuged at 350g at 4°C for 4 minutes. 
The cells (200–1000 cells/mm2) were cultured in plates or on glass 
coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine cultured in neurobasal medium 
containing B-27 supplements, GlutaMAX and penicillin/streptomycin
(100 U/mL and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively) as described.8 Cultures 
were incubated at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO
2
 and atmospheric 
air and refed with fresh medium every 3 days. Neurons in culture for 
7 to 10 days (days in vitro, 7–10) were used in the study.
Primary Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Cultures
Neurospheres were prepared from E14.5 fetuses of timed pregnant 
female mice as described.29 The dissociated cells were cultured in 25 
cm2 plastic culture flasks (2 brains per flask) in DMEM/F12 and 2% 
B27 neuronal supplement (Gibco, Baltimore, MD) plus 10 ng/mL 
EGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The detailed procedures were described 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation and 
Cell Death Assay
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) or neurons grown in 6-well 
plates were rinsed with an isotonic oxygen-glucose deprivation solution
(pH 7.4) as described.30 Cells were incubated in 0.5 mL of the

.30 For reoxygenation, the cells were 
incubated for 1, 3, 6, or 24 hours in the culture medium at 37°C in 
the incubator with 5% CO
2
 and atmospheric air. Cell viability was 
assessed by propidium iodide uptake and retention of calcein-AM as 
described30 and in the online-only Data Supplement.
Small Interfering RNA Treatment
Knockdown of SPAK or OSR1 protein expression in primary cortical 
neurons and OPCs was induced by the double-strand small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs). Scramble siRNA (Silencer Negative Control 
No. 1 siRNA, Cat. No. 12935-200) and siRNAs targeting mouse 
SPAK (ID: s79174) and OSR1 (ID: s99266) were from Invitrogen. 
Scramble siRNA was used as control. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX/
siRNA complexes were formed in serum-free Opti-MEM at 25°C for 
5 minutes according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 250 μL 
of complexes was added into each well of 6-well plates. Studies were 
performed in cultures after 72-hour transfection. siRNA-mediated 
knockdown of SPAK or OSR1 protein expression was validated by 
immunoblotting (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Immunostaining and Binary Image Analysis
Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused as previously described.31 Sections (−0.38 mm bregma; 35 μm) were incubated with 
blocking solution containing either rabbit anti–phosphorylated SPAK/
OSR1 (1:50), sheep anti-pNKCC1 antibody (1:100), mouse anti–Glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (1:100), mouse anti–adenomatous polyposis coli 
(APC) (1:100), or mouse anti–microtubule-associated protein-2 (1:100). 
After rinsing with TBS for 30 minutes, sections were incubated with the 
following secondary antibodies (1:200): goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 
488–conjugated IgG and goat anti-mouse Alexa Flour 546–conjugated 
IgG; or donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated IgG and donkey 
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546–conjugated IgG. Sections were incubated 
with nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 iodide (1:1000 in blocking solution) and 
mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For 
negative controls, brain sections were stained with secondary antibody 
only. The imaging method and the binary image analysis are further described
in the Methods in the online-only Data Supplement.
Luxol Fast Blue Staining
White matter injury was quantified as previously reported32 and is 
described in greater detail in the online-only Data Supplement.
Blood Brain Barrier Leakage Measurement
To measure the blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage, albumin infiltration 
in ischemic brains was examined by immunostaining as described previously.33 Briefly, coronal sections were immunostained with albumin antibody
(1:200), followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 
488–conjugated IgG. Three to five consecutive images were acquired 
from each hemisphere from each brain section (n=5 brains), using the 
confocal laser scanning microscope. Albumin signal intensity was measured
with a frame size of 1024×1024 pixels. Quantification was done 
using Image J software. Background intensity in each original image 
was subtracted and mean fluorescence intensity was obtained. The resulting
values were then averaged and subjected to statistical analysis.
Biotinylation, Membrane Isolation, and 
Immunoblotting
Cultured cells and brain cortex homogenates were prepared as previously
described.34 Biotinylation was as described in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Statistics
A total of 61 mice were used in the study, and no results were excluded
from the analysis. All measurements were performed by 
investigators who were blinded to the experimental conditions. The 
number of animals studied was 80% powered to detect 20% changes 
with α (2-sided)=0.05. Data were expressed as mean±SD or SEM (as 
indicated). Statistical significance was determined by Student t test 
or 1-way ANOVA using the Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test 
in case of multiple comparisons (SigmaPlot, Systat Software, Point 
Richmond, CA). Repeated measures and paired t tests were performed
for immunostaining analysis in ischemic brains. Neuroscore 
was analyzed by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. A P value 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Germline Deletion of WNK3 Decreases Infarct 
Volume and Demyelination and Improves 
Neurological Recovery After Ischemic Stroke
Regional cerebral blood flow and gross neurovascular anatomy
were indistinguishable in WNK3 KO (female, male) and 
WNK3 WT littermates (female, male) before, during, and 
after MCA occlusion (MCAO; Figure 1A). However, after 
24-hour reperfusion post MCAO, WNK3 KO brains exhibited
a marked reduction (> 50%) in cortical infarct volume 
(38.2±4.2 mm3) relative to WNK3 WT brains (79.4±18.0 mm3; 
P<0.05; Figure 1A). Eight WNK3 WT mice (4F/4M) and 8 
WNK3 KO mice (4F/4M) were assessed in the evaluation of 
ischemic infarct volume. Smaller infarctions were also noted 
repeatedly at 3 days post MCAO in WNK3 KO brains by magnetic
resonance imaging (data not shown), ruling out the concern
that the reduced infarct volume in WNK3 KO mice at 24 
hours post MCAO reflects a delayed development of postischemic
damage of unreduced extent.
WNK3 KO brains also exhibited significantly less demyelination
of external capsule white matter axonal tracks at day 3 
reperfusion relative to WT WNK3 brains (Figure 1B; P<0.05). 
Myelination was preserved in axonal bundles of the ipsilateral 
striatum of WNK3 KO mice when compared with WNK3 WT 
mice (Figure 1B). Importantly, the decreases in ischemic gray 
and white matter damage accompanying WNK3 deletion had 
functional consequences, as WNK3 KO mice exhibited accelerated
neurological recovery after MCAO as compared with 
their WT littermates (Figure 1C). All male mice (9 WNK3 
WT, 8 WNK3 KO) were included in the analysis of neurological
functional deficits in Figure 1C. The sensorimotor 
function of WNK3 KO mice at days 3 to 7 reperfusion scored 
significantly better27 than that of WNK3 WT mice (Figure 1C; 
n=10; P<0.05). As shown in Figure 1D, pNKCC1 abundance 
in plasmalemmal membrane fractions was significantly elevated
in the ipsilateral hemispheres of WNK3 WT mice at 
24-hour reperfusion. In contrast, little change in pNKCC1 
was observed in the corresponding membrane or cytosol fractions
from WNK3 KO brains. Similar phenotypes of reduced 
neurological deficits and preserved axonal myelination were 
detected in NKCC1−/− mice and in NKCC1 WT mice treated 
with NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (Figure III in the onlineonly Data Supplement).

KO mice exhibited significantly less cerebral edema at 24 
hours after focal ischemia when compared with WNK3 WT 
mice (Figure 2A). Similar findings were obtained from measurement
of the percentage of hemisphere swelling from the 
TTC-stained brain sections shown in Figure 2B. In addition, 
we evaluated the BBB integrity by analyzing infiltration of 
blood albumin in the ischemic brain tissues. BBB integrity 
was compromised in WNK3 WT mice at 3 days after focal 
ischemia, as reflected by a dramatic increase in albumin 
accumulation in ischemic brain tissues (Figure 2B and 2C, 
arrows). In contrast, WNK3 KO brains exhibited significantly 
less albumin infiltration (Figure 2C). These data show WNK3

knockout reduces cerebral edema and the BBB breakdown 
after ischemic stroke.
Focal Cerebral Ischemia Stimulates the Activating 
Phosphorylation of NKCC1 by the WNK and 
SPAK/OSR1 Kinases
We next investigated activation of SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 signaling
in ischemic brains using antibodies that recognize only 
the phosphorylated (ie, active) species of SPAK/OSR1 (SPAK/
OSR1 [T-loop] phospho-Thr233/Thr185)35,36 and of NKCC1 
(phospho-Thr203, Thr207, and Thr212).37 A marked elevation of 
p-SPAK/p-OSR1 (Figure 3A and 3B, arrows) and pNKCC1 
(Figure 4A and 4B, arrows) in ipsilateral peri-infarct areas 
(cortex and striatum) was detected at 6 or 24-hour reperfusion 
relative to the control contralateral cortex and striatum. The 
binary image analysis of the immnunofluorescence images 
separated specific immunologic signal from background 
(Figure IVA and IVB in the online-only Data Supplement) 
in each image (Figures 3, 4A, and 4B). pSPAK/pOSR1 and 
pNKCC1 immunoreactive signals were localized in neurons, 
which are stained positively for the neuronal marker protein 
microtubule-associated protein-2 (Figures 3, 4A, and 4B, 
double-arrowhead ). Expression of pSPAK/pOSR1 in total 
cells (TO-PRO 3+) or neurons (microtubule-associated protein-2+) was further quantified (Figure 3). However, pSPAK/
pOSR1 was not detected in GFAP+ cells (astrocytes) of ipsilateral
cortex or striatum at 6-hour reperfusion (Figure IVC 
in the online-only Data Supplement), consistent with the 
delayed development of astrogliosis, usually beyond 48-hour 
reperfusion.31
In addition, expression of p-SPAK/p-OSR1 in the white 
matter of corpus callosum progressed from low levels at 6-hour 
reperfusion (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement), 
through increased level at 24-hour reperfusion, to peak levels 
at 72-hour reperfusion, returning to basal levels by day 7 
(168-hour reperfusion). The cells with robust expression of 
pSPAK/pOSR1 at 72-hour reperfusion were confirmed as 
APC+ mature oligodendrocytes (Figure 3C). These findings 
suggest that stimulation of the SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway 
in ischemic brains was differentially regulated with regard to 
brain region and cell type. The delayed increase of pSPAK/
pOSR1 and pNKCC1 in the ipsilateral corpus callosum white 
matter (Figures 3C and 4C, arrows) is consistent with the timing
of oligodendrocyte degeneration after MCAO.38 Strikingly, 
knockout of WNK3 in vivo abrogated the ischemia-induced 
increases pSPAK/pOSR1 and pNKCC1 in the cortex and striatum
(Figures 3 and 4). In addition, abundance of pSPAK/
pOSR1 and pNKCC1 was decreased in the corpus callosum 
of APC+ cells in WNK3 KO mice (Figures 3C and 4C). In 
WNK3 KO white matter tissues, pSPAK/pOSR1-immunoreactive
signals and pNKCC1 signals (especially in the cytosol) 
remain detectable (Figures 3C and 4C). A possible role for 
WNK1 or other WNKs in maintaining the residual NKCC1 
phosphorylation in WNK3 KO brains remains to be tested.
Knockdown of WNK3 or SPAK/OSR1 Protects 
Neurons and OPCs Against Ischemic Damage in 
Culture
Robust SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 phosphoactivation was also confirmed
in neurons or oligodendroglial precursor cell cultures 
(OPCs) in a model of in vitro ischemia (2-hour oxygen and 
glucose deprivation plus 24-hour reoxygenation). Activating 
phosphorylation of SPAK/OSR1 at 1- to 6-hour reoxygenation
and surface expression of pNKCC1 at 24-hour reoxygenation
were detected in WNK3 WT but not in WNK3 KO 
neurons (Figure 5A and 5B) and were accompanied by >40% 
cell death in WNK3 WT neurons (Figure 5C). NKCC1 inhibition

in WT OPCs treated with SPAK/OSR1 siRNAs. Additional 
studies are needed to determine the cell protection mechanisms

Discussion
The evolutionarily conserved WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase signaling
pathway maintains ionic homeostasis via the regulated phosphorylation
of the cation-chloride cotransporters. Mutations of 
WNK1/WNK4 cause a Mendelian form of salt-sensitive human 
hypertension because of SPAK/OSR1-mediated hyperphosphorylation
and activation of renal Na+-Cl- cotransporter.14,15
However, the functions of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway in 
other tissues, including the brain, have been little studied. We 
now provide in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrating that 
activation of the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 kinase signaling pathway 
is associated with the pathophysiology of neuronal and oligodendrocyte
injury after ischemic stroke. In particular, genetic 
inactivation of WNK3 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of 
SPAK/OSR1 prevented demyelination and reduced OPC death. 
Because white matter comprises half of human forebrain volume 
and is highly susceptible to ischemic damage,39 our data highlight
the WNK/SPAK/NKCC1 signaling complex as a novel, 
potential therapeutic target for neuroprotection and preservation
of myelination after stroke. Our current study suggests that

1964 Stroke July 2015
WNK3-dependent SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylation of NKCC1 
at T203/T207/T212, a key N-terminal cytoplasmic domain regulatory
motif of the cotransporter, is required for ischemia-induced 
activation of NKCC1, at least in part via effects on transporter 
surface expression.22,37 These findings are consistent with the 
reported roles of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade in 
plasmalemmal accumulation of ion transporters through their 
decreased ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation.40,41
Previous reports revealed that increased NKCC1 function
contributes to ischemic brain damage by cellular influx of 
Na+ and Cl− and, secondarily, of Ca2+, triggering cell swelling, 
breakdown of the BBB,42 and damage to the endoplasmic reticulum
and mitochondria that leads to both necrotic and apoptotic
cell death.34,43,44 How ischemia activates the WNK3-SPAK/
OSR1-NKCC1 signaling cascade remains unclear. Recent 
studies by Piala et al13 revealed WNK1 as a direct Cl− sensor, 
with Cl− binding at the active site and leading to Cl−-dependent 
inhibition of WNK1 autophosphorylation. Increased tissue 
osmolality, or pathological changes in ionic contents, such as 
Cl−, may catalyze dysregulated WNK-SPAK/OSR1 activity by 
direct interaction with the WNK catalytic site.45–47 Alternatively, 
inflammation may play a role in WNK-SPAK/OSR1 activation.
Indeed, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α
stimulated colonic SPAK expression and activation during the 
pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation,48 and oxidative stress 
mediated by H

O

 or NH

Cl triggered NKCC1 phosphorylation 
and astrocyte swelling.49 An increase in [Ca2+]
i
 via activation of 
ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors was also shown 
to increase NKCC1 activity in neurons.50,51 All these factors are 
present and active in the ischemic brain, and future studies will 
be necessary to elucidate their possible roles in activation of the 
WNK3-SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 cascade.
Taken together, our findings on the WNK3 dependence 
of SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 phosphoactivation in ischemic 
stroke are compelling in the context of novel pharmacotherapeutic
strategies. Inhibition of the widely expressed 
SPAK/OSR1 or NKCC1 might be expected to elicit effects 
outside the CNS, as reflected by the extra-CNS phenotypes 
of their KO mice.11,52 In contrast, the abundant expression 
of WNK3 in brain17,18,20,53,54 and the normal electrolyte balance
and grossly normal phenotypes of unstressed WNK3
KO mice23,24 suggest that WNK3 inhibition might modulate 
brain SPAK/OSR1 and NKCC1, reducing gray and white 
matter damage and improving neurological recovery after 
ischemic stroke, with minimal effects on other organ systems
including the kidney.

METHODS
Breeding and genotyping of WNK3 KO and NKCC1-/- mice
The gene encoding WNK3 is located on the X chromosome. Female WNK3-/-(KO) mice , male 
WNK3Y/- (KO) mice, female WNK3+/+(WT) mice, and male WNK3Y/+ (WT) mice, all in the 
C57Bl/6J background, were obtained by a multi-step breeding scheme.  First, gene-targeted 
WNK3+/- females and WNK3Y/+(WT) males were mated to generate WNK3Y/- (KO) and WNK3Y/+ 
(WT) males, along with WNK3+/- and WNK+/+ (WT) females.  Subsequent breeding mated WNK3+/-
females with WNK3Y/- (KO) males, resulting in progeny including WNK3Y/- (KO) and WNK3Y/+ (WT) 
males, along with WNK3+/- and WNK3-/- (KO) females.  An additional breeding scheme to generate 
male WNK3Y/- (KO) males involved mating WNK3Y/+(WT) males with WNK3-/- (KO) females.  Mice 
were inbred ~16 generations at BIDMC before transfer to PITT and <3 generations of mice were used 
in each set of experimental results presented in this study.
P21 mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of tail DNA with a 3-primer
protocol. Forward primer F1 (5'- AGGTCTTAAGAAGCTGGTGCAGG-3') amplified both 
wildtype (WT) and WNK3 knockout (KO) alleles. Reverse primer R1 (5' -
AAGACTGAGGAGCCAGAGAAGG-3') amplified only the WT allele. Reverse primer R2 (5'-
CAGTATCGGCCTCAGGAAGATCG-3') amplified only the KO allele. Hot start PCR was 
performed with 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 60°C for 2 min, and 
extension at 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, yielding a WT 
amplimer of 462 bp and a KO amplimer of 303 nt.  
Genotyping and maintenance of the NKCC1-/- mouse colony (SV129/Black Swiss) has been 
described previously 4. NKCC1 homozygous mutant and NKCC1+/+ mice were obtained by 
breeding gene-targeted NKCC1 heterozygous mutant mice.  The genotype of each mouse was 
determined by PCR of DNA from fetus tail biopsies as described 5

Genetic analysis of WNK3 insertional knockout (WNK3 KO) mice 
Female WNK3-/- and male WNK3Y/- knockout mice were generated from the ES cell line RRJ530
(Bay Genomics) by the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers at the University of 
California-Davis (mmrrc.ucdavis.edu). Genomic PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products 
from WNK3 KO mice revealed insertion of the BayGenomics gene-trap vector pGT0Ixf into 
mouse WNK3 Exon 4 (numbered as in human WNK3 and as per mouse WNK3 [XM_909586; 
corresponding to nt A111224 of BAC RP23-84O5 (AL732420)]. The aberrant integration 
included a partial vector deletion joining WNK3 nt A111224 to vector nt C1596 (numbered from 
the HindIII site of pGT0Ixf). RT-PCR and direct cDNA sequencing revealed an encoded fusion 
protein joining WNK3 Lys258 (nt 772-774 in XM_909586) to His22 of the Engrailed-2 leader
(nt1596-1598 in pGT0Ixf map), followed by a long ORF including the predicted full-length β-
GEO reporter terminating at pGT01xf nt 5507. The vector insertion disrupts the WNK3 kinase 
domain, and removes the downstream WNK3 coding sequence from the predicted encoded 
polypeptide. The fusion protein cDNA was not sequenced in full-length. 
Sequencing of mouse WNK3 cDNA
Mouse WNK3 cDNA from brain and kidney was PCR-amplified as overlapping cDNA 
fragments, purified from 1% agarose gel and sequenced. Oligonucleotide design was based on 
XM_909586, which described human WNK3 as a pseudogene with ORF termination after nt 
1869 (Cys 623) inside predicted exon 9. However, our direct sequencing indicated that the Exon 
9 - Intron 9 boundary predicted by XM_909586 was incorrect, and that mouse WNK3 encodes at 
least two full-length transcript variants (Supplementary Figure I B).  One variant includes fulllength
exon 18 (JQ247189, used to derive NCBI RefSeq NM_001271678). The second variant 
includes a truncated exon 18 (JQ247190, used to derive NM_001271679). Both variant 
transcripts and the encoding genomic region lack sequence corresponding to human exon 22. 
Thus mouse WNK3 exon 21 is spliced directly to exon 23, and exon 22 (per human exon 
nomenclature) is absent from the mouse genome. 
Tissue distribution of WNK3 transcripts 
Total RNA from freshly resected mouse tissues (brain, kidney, spleen, fetal liver, liver, heart, 
stomach, ileum, proximal colon) and from ES cells was prepared using the RNeasy mini kit 
(Qiagen) or, for lung, thymus, and testis, purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Reverse 
transcription was performed with the Retroscript First Strand DNA Synthesis Kit (Ambion) using 
1 µg of total RNA. 5% of this cDNA was used for Hot Start PCR (HotStarTaq DNA polymerase; 
Qiagen) in a total reaction volume of 50 µl in the supplier’s recommended buffer. Reaction mixes 
were activated for 15 min at 95 °C, then subjected to 36 or 38 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 94 
°C, annealing for 2 min at 60 °C, and elongation for 2-4 min at 72 °C. Final extension of 10 min 
at 72 °C was terminated by rapid cooling to 4 °C. Equal volumes of PCR products were separated 
in 1% agarose gels for analysis, purified as necessary with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit 
(Qiagen) and sequenced. WNK3 mRNA abundance was highest in brain, testis, and in ES cells 
(Supplementary Figure I). RT-PCR conducted with two different sets of primers yielded 
comparable relative abundance across all tissues tested (Supplementary Figure I A, B). The 
longer WNK3 transcript including full-length exon 18 appeared more abundant in brain, but was
detected in most other tissues as a minor band (Supplementary Figure I). In contrast, the 
transcript containing truncated exon 18 was absent from kidney, as previously noted 6. However, 
3
(8.0.0.2542.29178464 PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSIOn)
in contrast to the data of Glover et al 6, sequence corresponding to human exon 22 was absent 
from both WNK3 transcripts of mouse, as well as from the mouse WNK3 gene. The identity of all 
PCR amplimers was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion
Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane vaporized in N2O and O2 (3:2) for induction and 
1.5% isoflurane for maintenance. A rubber silicon-coated monofilament suture (Filament size 6-
0, diameter 0.09-0.11 mm, length 20 mm; diameter with coating 0.23 ± 0.02 mm; coating length 
5 mm) was used to block MCA blood flow as previously described 7. For reperfusion, the suture
was withdrawn 60 min after MCAO. For regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurement, an 
incision along the midline of the scalp was performed. The probe of the laser Doppler (Model 
PD-434, Vasa medics, LLC, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) was placed on the intact skull (2 mm 
posterior and 6 mm lateral from the bregma). Tympanic membrane and rectal temperature probes 
were inserted and cranial and body temperatures were maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5ºC throughout the
experiment by a heating blanket.  For bumetanide treatment (or saline control experiments), 
bumetanide (10 mg/kg body weight in saline) or saline was administered via intraperitoneal 
(I.P.) injection, initially at 3 h reperfusion, and then daily (every 24 h) at the same dose.
Primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) cultures
After culturing of neurospheres for 7 days, floating neurospheres were passaged at a ratio of 1:3 
in the same medium every 3–4 days. To produce oligospheres, neurospheres were mechanically
dissociated by 0.25% trypsin into single cell suspensions and resuspended in DMEM/F12 and 
2% B27 neuronal supplement plus 10 ng/mL platelet derived growth factor (PDGF, Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ) and 10 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech). After 72 h in culture, oligosphere cultures in 
aggregates were passaged at a ratio of 1:2 every 4–7 days. OPCs from oligospheres were
generated by chemical disaggregation with 0.25% trypsin. The single OPC suspension was 
plated in 6- or 24-well plates (coated with 0.05% Poly-L-ornithine) at a cell density of 104
cells/cm2 and OPC in DIV 2-4 were used for experiments.
Cell death assay
Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) uptake and retention of calcein-AM as 
described 8. Cultured neurons or OPCs were rinsed with the isotonic control buffer and incubated
with 0.5 µM calcein-AM and 1 µg/ml PI in the same buffer at 37°C for 30 min. For cell counting,
cells were rinsed with the isotonic control buffer and visualized with a Nikon TiE inverted
epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 20X objective lens. Calcein-AM or PI
fluorescence was visualized and cell viability expressed as the ratio of calcein-positive cells to 
the sum of calcein-positive and PI-positive cells.
Immunostaining image collection
40x fluorescent images were captured with a Leica DMIRE2 inverted confocal laser scanning
microscope as previously described 9.  Stained cells were counted in a blinded manner by two 
independent researchers using ImageJ. Cells were counted in 7 evenly distributed areas (375 ×
375 μm2) in each brain section (n=4 brains) of the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Cell 
numbers were normalized and expressed as percentage of TO-PRO-3, MAP-2-positive, APC-
positive, or GFAP-positive cells in each area. Binary image analysis was quantitated in ImageJ 
as described below.
4
(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
Primary OPC cultures were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed 10. Cells were then incubated 
with either primary anti-NKCC1 mAb (1:100), anti-A2B5 mAb [(1:100, a marker for precursor
cells 11], or anti-MBP pAb (1:100). Fluorescence images were captured as described above. 
Binary image analysis 
Binary image analysis of immunofluorescent images was conducted as described 12, 13. Confocal 
images of immunofluorescence-stained brain sections (35 µm) were acquired with a Leica 
DMIRE2 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope, using a 40x objective, identical pinhole, 
intensity, and exposure parameters for all images to be compared. Background intensity in each 
original image was subtracted using MetaMorph image processing software, as shown in 
Supplemental Figure IV A and IV B, illustrating selection of small regions of interest (ROI, 
boxed areas) with minimal fluorescent signals.  Background fluorescent intensities were recorded 
in ROIs, allowing background subtraction for each image. Note also that secondary antibody
alone (Alexa-488 anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa-546 anti-mouse IgG) gave rise to minimal background 
fluorescence (2oAb alone, Supplemental Figure IV).
Binary images were generated by conversion to 8 bit images (of grayscale 0-256).  These were 
subjected to thresholding, with pixel intensities of grayscale values 0-15 representing signals 
(black), and pixel intensities >15 considered as background (white). The process is illustrated in 
Fig. 3 A, in which the thresholded pSPAK/pOSR1-positive signals are black and background 
signals white.  Specific immunoreactive signals were separated from background in each image.  
Changes in immnunofluorescence signals of pSPAK/pOSR1 or pNKCC1 detected in the 
contralateral (CL) and ipsilateral (IL) brain regions were then analyzed with ImageJ software.  
In Fig. 3A-B, low basal levels of pSPAK/pOSR1 immunofluorescence signals were detected in 
soma (double arrowhead) in the CL hemispheres, in contrast to the high levels of overall MAP2 
protein expression.  However, neuronal cells in the IL peri-ischemic sections showed a sharp 
increase in pSPAK/pOSR1 immunoreactivity in the soma region in the binary images (double
arrowhead).  This enabled us to count neurons with increased intensity of pSPAK/pOSR1 
immunoreactive signals in ischemic brain sections, then normalize those values to total TO-PRO
3+-cell numbers. Because similar changes occurred in APC+ oligodendrocytes, the method was 
also applied to oligodendrocyte cell counting as shown in Fig.3 C.
In the case of binary images of pNKCC1 immunostaining (Fig. 4A-C), the CL exhibited specific 
signals of moderate intensity in both dendrite processes (arrowhead) and somata (double 
arrowhead), and ischemia increased pNKCC1 immunostaining signals differentially in these
two locations.  Cells with increased pNKCC1 expression in the cell body were counted and 
compared (Fig. 4).
Luxol Fast Blue Staining
Coronal sections were stained with Luxol fast blue (American Mastertech, Lodi, CA) according 
to the manufacturer's protocol. The optical density of stained sections was measured from corpus 
callosum to external capsule in both CL and IL hemispheres using Image J software. The 
intensity signals in the IL were divided by those in the CL and were presented as the % optical 
density ratio. In striatum, the number of axonal bundles in the CL and IL was counted using 
Image J software. The number of axonal bundles in the IL striatum was divided by that in the CL 
striatum and presented as % axonal bundle ratio.

Biotinylation
Cell surface protein biotinylation labeling was performed as described previously 14. Briefly, 
cultured neurons in 6-well plates were washed 2 times with PBS containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 
1 mM CaCl2 (PBS-CM), then incubated with 2 ml of PBS-CM containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHSSS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. After labeling, the biotin reaction was quenched by 
washing 3 times with ice-cold PBS-CM containing 50 mM glycine and 0.1% bovine serum 
albumin. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer and the supernatant was collected. Protein 
concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. After correction for 
protein contents, 1:1 slurry of UltraLink NeutrAvidin (Pierce) was added to the supernatant (200
µg protein) to pull down the biotin-labeled surface proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin bound 
complex was washed with PBS-CM and centrifuged for 1 min at 3000g three times. The 
NeutrAvidin beads were then boiled for 10 min in 2X SDS loading buffer (©Thermo Scientific 
Inc. (Rockford, IL) to elute biotin-labeled protein. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Preparation of brain membrane fractions
Mice were anesthetized with 3% isfluorane vaporized in N2O and O2 (3:2) and decapitated. The 
contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres were dissected in five volumes of cold homogenization 
buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). Brain tissues were gently homogenized with a tissue pestle grinder 
(Kontes, Vineland, N J, USA) for 10 strokes in homogenization buffer. The homogenized 
samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant (S1) was collected and 
centrifuged at ~200,000 x g for 30 min using Beckman OptimaTM XL-80k Ultracentrifuge. The 
cytosolic fraction [supernatant (S2)] and crude membrane pellet were collected. The pellet was 
resuspended in the homogenization buffer. Protein content in both membrane and cytosolic 
fractions was determined by the standard BCA method.
Immunoblotting
Protein concentration in protein samples was measured with the bicinchoninic acid assay. Protein 
samples (20 µg cellular lysates, or 40 µg homogenates) were loaded on 7.5% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate gels and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. The membrane was incubated with the rabbit anti-p-SPAK/p-OSR1 antibody (1:500 
dilution) or p-NKCC1 antibody at 4°C overnight. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence agents. The densities of bands were normalized to the loading control 
GAPDH.

Direct sequencing of cDNA amplimers from panel A revealed two alternate splice patterns for 
exon 18: the upper band of panel A contains full-length exon 18, whereas the lower band has a 
141 bp (47 codon) in-frame deletion/truncation of the 3’-end of exon 18.  Direct sequencing of 
major cDNA bands from panel B (including brain) showed that mouse WNK3 exon 21 is directly 
spliced to exon 23 in WNK3 mRNA.  DNA sequence homologous to human exon 22 was absent 
from the mouse genome (not shown).  The lower band in panel B (visible in spleen, fetal lever 
and lung) was shown by direct sequencing to be nonspecific and unrelated to Wnk3.  Leftmost
