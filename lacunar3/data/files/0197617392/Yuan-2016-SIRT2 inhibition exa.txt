Abstract
Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-
dependent protein deacetylases. In recent years, SIRT2
inhibition has emerged as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative
diseases. However, to date, there is no evidence of
a specific role for SIRT2 in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We
investigated the effects of SIRT2 inhibition on experimental
TBI using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model.
Adult male mice underwent CCI or sham surgery. A selective
brain-permeable SIRT2 inhibitor, AK-7, was administrated
30 min before injury. The volume of the brain edema lesion
and the water content of the brain were significantly increased
in mice treated with AK-7 (20 mg/kg), compared with the
vehicle group, following TBI (p < 0.05 at 1 day and p < 0.05 at
3 days, respectively). Concomitantly, AK-7 administration
greatly worsened neurobehavioral deficits on days 3 and 7
after CCI. Furthermore, blood–brain barrier disruption and
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 activity increased following
SIRT2 inhibition. AK-7 treatment increased TBI-induced
microglial activation both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by
a large increase in the expression and release of inflammatory
cytokines. Mechanistically, SIRT2 inhibition increased both
K310 acetylation and nuclear translocation of NF-jB p65,
leading to enhanced NF-jB activation and up-regulation of its
target genes, including aquaporin 4 (AQP4), MMP-9, and proinflammatory cytokines. Together, these data demonstrate
that SIRT2 inhibition exacerbates TBI by increasing NF-jB
p65 acetylation and activation. Our findings provide additional
evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of SIRT2.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a primary insult that
occurs at the moment of impact that initiates subsequent
physiological and pathological reactions that may last
for days to months (Masel and DeWitt 2010). Despite
recent advances in the understanding of the pathological
process of TBI, an effective treatment that prevents
or repairs TBI-induced loss-of-function remains to be
discovered.

Sirtuins are mammalian homologs of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae silencing protein Sir2, which uses NAD+ as a
cofactor to remove an acetyl group from the epsilon amine of
lysine (Houtkooperet al.2012). These proteins have received
widespread attention over the last few years, owing to their
diverse physiological roles in various biological processes (Qiu
et al. 2010; Hoffmann et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014). There
are seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7), with distinctive
subcellular localizations and enzymatic functions (Houtkooper
et al. 2012). SIRT1, primarily localized to the nucleus, is the
most similar to the yeast Sir2 and is also the best characterized
of the sirtuin proteins (de Oliveira et al. 2012). In previous
studies, pharmacological activation or up-regulation of the
expression of SIRT1 had neuroprotective effects in several
models of neurodegenerative disease (Kim et al. 2007; Donmez et al. 2012). A neuroprotective effect of SIRT1 was
recently confirmed in experimental TBI, both in vitro and
in vivo (Zhao et al. 2012). In contrast to SIRT1, SIRT2 is
predominantlylocalizedtothecytosol,andlittleisknownabout
its precise function (de Oliveiraet al.2012). Its inhibition, and
not activation, has been shown to have beneficial effects in
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD)
and Huntington’s disease (HD) (Outeiro et al. 2007; Pallos
et al. 2008; Luthi-Carter et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2011;
Chopraet al.2012; Di Frusciaet al.2015). In tests onin vitro
and invertebrate models of HD, SIRT2 inhibition conferred
neuroprotective effects by the negative regulation of polyglutamine
inclusion and sterol biosynthesis (Pallos et al. 2008;
Luthi-Carter et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2011; Chopra et al.
2012). Similarly, in tests onin vitroand animal models of PD,
its inhibition rescued neuronal cells froma-synuclein-induced
toxicity, potentially by modulating microtubule stabilization
(Outeiro et al. 2007). Curiously, contrary to pharmacological
inhibition, reduction or ablation of SIRT2 expression has
recently been shown to have no effect on HD progression, as
assessed by physiological and behavioral tests (Bobrowska
et al. 2012). The mechanism of SIRT2 inhibition-dependent
neuroprotection remains elusive. TBI and neurodegenerative
diseases share many pathological features, such as inflammation
, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of b-amyloid
(Loaneet al.2009;MannixandWhalen2012).Itistemptingto
speculate that SIRT2 inhibition may have a beneficial effect on
the TBI process and that SIRT2 may represent a novel potential
therapeutic target for TBI treatment.
In the present study, we utilized several preclinical targetvalidation
paradigms and examined the in vivo efficacy of
SIRT2 inhibition in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model
of TBI in mice.
Materials and methods
Study design and experimental groups
AK-7 (Gene Operation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), a selective, brainpermeable
SIRT2 inhibitor (Taylor et al. 2011), was dissolved in
water containing 25% Cremophor EL (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma Aldrich). This SIRT2
solution and vehicle control were injected intraperitoneally twice
daily. Thefirst injection was performed 30 min before TBI induction.
Mice were killed for biological studies at 1 and 3 days after TBI,
unless otherwise indicated. To determine the dose–response relationship
, AK-7 wasfirst tested at 10 and 20 mg/kg in male C57Bl/6 mice.
These doses were found to be beneficial in HT mice, with no obvious
side effects (Chopra et al. 2012). Mice were coded and randomly
divided intofive groups using a random number table: sham+vehicle
(n = 3), sham+AK-7 20 mg/kg (n = 3); TBI+vehicle (n = 6);
TBI+AK-7 10 mg/kg (n = 6); and TBI+AK-7 20 mg/kg (n = 6).
The 20 mg/kg dose was used for subsequent neuropathological and
biochemical studies because significant differences in brain edema
volume were detected at that dose.
Surgical procedures and CCI injury model
All surgical procedures and experimental protocols were performed
in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School
of Biomedical Engineering. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice (20–25 g;
Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Corporation, Shanghai, China)
were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/
kg). The mice were placed on a heated pad, and their core body
temperature was maintained at 37°C. The head was mounted in a
stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA), and the surgical
site was cleaned with ethanol scrubs. A midline incision (10 mm
long) was made over the skull, the skin and fascia were retracted,
and a craniotomy was performed using a 4-mm trephine over the
central aspect of the left parietal bone, 1 mm lateral to the sagittal
suture. Care was taken to keep the dura intact. Mice were excluded
from the study if dural integrity was breached. A contusion injury
was created using a CCI device (PinPoint Precision Cortical
Impactor PCI3000; Hatteras Instruments Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
with a 3-mm diameter, rounded, steel impactor tip, oriented
perpendicular to the cortical surface. An injury of moderate severity
was induced using an impact velocity of 1.5 m/s, deformation depth
of 1.5 mm, and dwell time of 85 ms. After injury, sterile cotton was
used to control the bleeding of the injured cortical surface. The
incision was closed with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures, and the animal
was placed in a heated cage to maintain its body temperature until
fully conscious, after which time it was returned to its home cage.
Sham animals underwent exactly the same procedure as the injured
mice, but the impact was not performed. TBI modeling and drug
treatment were conducted by the same person in order to minimize
the variance in operation.
Measurement of brain edema and brain water content
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a mouse
MRI scanner (Simenz Signa EXCITE 3.0 T, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA)
24 h after CCI. The parameters were as follows: T2-weighted (T2W)
MRI: repetition time = 3,670 ms; echo time (TE) = 97 ms; thickness = 0.8 mm; field of view = 709 70 mm; number of excitations = 1.5. Body temperature was maintained at 37.6  0.5°C using
a heating fan. A proficient neuroradiologist (LL) who was blind to the
study design evaluated all MRI images. The brain edema lesion,
including the contusion area, was evaluated based on the T2WIs using
NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA).

Water content in the brain was quantified using the wet–dry
method. Briefly, water content was estimated from a 3-mm coronal
tissue section of the ipsilateral cortex (or corresponding contralateral
cortex), centered on the impact site. Tissue samples were immediately
weighed to determine wet weight. Samples were subsequently
dried in an oven at 100°C for 24 h to obtain dry weight. Tissue
water content (%) was calculated as (wet weightdry weight) ⁄ wet
weight9 100.
Measurement of Evans blue extravasation
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability was investigated at 1 and
3 days followingTBI by measuring extravasation of Evans blue (Sigma
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The dye (2%; 4 mL/kg) was injected
intravenously 2 h before the mice were killed. Then, the mice were
perfused with phosphate-buffered saline through the left ventricle. After
removal of intravascular-localized dye, the brain was divided into two
hemispheres. Each sample was immediately weighed and homogenized
in 1 mL 50% trichloroacetic acid solution. After centrifugation
(12 000 g, 20 min), the supernatant was diluted 1 : 3 with ethanol,
anditsabsorbancewasdeterminedat610 nmusingaspectrophotometer
(BioTek,Winooski,VT,USA).Thequantityofdyewascalculatedusing
a standard curve and expressed as micrograms per gram of brain tissue.
Immunocytochemistry and image analysis
Brain cryosections (20 lm in thickness) were fixed with absolute
methanol in a 20°C freezer for approximately 10 min, blocked
with 10% normal goat serum, and incubated with one or a mixture
of two of the following primary antibodies: rat anti-CD11b, rat anti-
CD31 (all at 1 : 100 dilution; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA),
rabbit anti-occludin, rabbit anti-ZO-1 (all at 1 : 100 dilution; Life
Technologies, CA, USA); goat anti-Iba-1 (1 : 100, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), mouse anti-NeuN (all at 1 : 100; Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA), and rabbit anti-AQP4 (1 : 100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline,
sections were incubated with Alexa-488- or Alexa-594-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1 : 250 dilution; Life Technologies). Nuclei
were stained with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 : 5000 dilution;
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nan Tong, China). Freefloating brain sections (30 lm) collected from both sham and TBI
groups underwent heat-induced antigen retrieval were used for
SIRT2 (rabbit ant-SIRTT2, 1 : 100; Abcam) immunostaining.
Multiplex assessment of six cytokines and chemokines
The levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, macrophage inflammatory
protein-2 (MIP-2), MCP-1, and IL-10 in serum were simultaneously
analyzed using Luminex xMAP technology and kits obtained from
Millipore (MCYTOMAG-70K-06; Millipore). All procedures were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Median
fluoresce intensity data obtained by the Luminex 200 instrument
were analyzed using xPONENT software, using a weighted fiveparameter
logistic method for calculating cytokine/chemokine
concentrations in samples, by comparison with standard curves.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear protein samples were obtained using the Nuclear Extract Kit
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nan Tong, China), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA–protein interactions were
measured using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) as follows. Nuclear extracts
(25 lg) were incubated with a biotin-labeled NF-jB probe (Grall
et al. 2003) (50-tcgacatgtgggattttcccatgac-30) at 25 C for 20 min.
Protein–DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide
gel, transferred to nylon membranes (Millipore), and cross-linked
via exposure to 312 nm UV light. Membranes were subsequently
incubated with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase for 15 min.
Biotin-labeled DNA signals were visualized using the enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean  SE of the mean. Equality of
variance was assessed by Levene’s test, and t-tests were used to
compare mean; p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant. GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA) was used for graphic representation of data. The statistical
package used for analyses was SPSS 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
SIRT2 is up-regulated in the peri-contusional area after TBI
To study the role of SIRT2 in the development of TBI, we
first analyzed the expression of SIRT2 protein in mouse brain
homogenates from the peri-contusional regions of the
ipsilateral cortices. Its expression significantly increased
after TBI, compared with sham-operated animals, at all time
points. The increase started at 6 h after TBI, peaked at
3 days, and lasted up to 7 days (Fig. 1b and c). The
expression of the SIRT2 gene was assessed by PCR. The
SIRT2 mRNA level in the TBI group was approximately 1.5-
fold that of the sham control group, at 6 h post-injury.
Evaluation of SIRT2 mRNA level over time revealed a peak
at 24 h (Fig. 1d). To examine the cellular expression of
SIRT2 in the damaged brain, we conducted GFAP/SIRT2,
NeuN/SIRT2, and Iba-1/SIRT2 double immunolabeling, and
as expected (Maxwell et al. 2011), we found that SIRT2 was
located exclusively in the cytosol (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, we
observed that SIRT2 was highly expressed in the neurons of
both sham and TBI animals, while it was specifically
expressed in the astrocytes of TBI animals (Fig. 1e). SIRT2
was also found in primary microglia cells (Iba-1 positive,
Fig. S1).
SIRT2 inhibition promotes cerebral edema after TBI
To investigate whether SIRT2 is involved in the development
of cerebral edema, the SIRT2 selective inhibitor, AK-7, was
administered prior to induction of a moderate TBI in mice.
Brain edema was evaluated by T2-weighted MRI at 1 and
3 days after brain injury. As shown in Fig. 2a, brain edema,
centered on the percussion site was evident after TBI in the
vehicle group. The high-intensity area was expanded to a
very wide region emanating from the contusion site in mice
pretreated with AK-7. Statistical analysis indicated that

20 mg/kg AK-7 pretreatment significantly increased the
volume of the brain edema lesion, compared with the vehicle
group (p < 0.01 at 1 day and p < 0.01 at 3 days, respectively
) (Fig. 2b).
Brain tissue samples from the same set of mice were
weighed and dehydrated. As shown in Fig. 2d, the water
content in the tissue increased in the ipsilateral cortex after
TBI (80.8%), compared with the sham group (78.5%,
p < 0.05 vs. TBI). Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg AK-7 did
not significantly affect edema (81.4%), whereas 20 mg/kg
AK-7 significantly increased edema (81.9%; p < 0.05 vs.
TBI) at 24 h post-TBI. Brain water content was also
statistically significant in the AK-7 group compared with
the vehicle group at 3 days after TBI (82.7%; p < 0.05 vs.
TBI). These results were consistent with the distribution and
sizes of the edematous regions in the brain, as evaluated by
T2-weighted MRI.
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) plays an important role in the
formation of brain edema (Laird et al. 2010). To assess the
biological effects of AK-7 on the formation of brain edema,
mice treated with 20 mg/kg AK-7 were killed at 1 and
3 days after TBI. Western blot analyses showed that the
levels of AQP4 protein increased after TBI and were
significantly higher in the AK-7-treated group than in the
untreated group (p < 0.001 at 1 day and p < 0.05 at 3 days,
respectively) (Fig. 2c, e and f). Taken together, these results
indicate that AK-7-mediated SIRT2 inhibition increases
cerebral edema following TBI, in part, by up-regulating
AQP4 expression.
Brain edema can result in neurological deficits (Donkin
and Vink 2010). To determine the effects of SIRT2
inhibition on behavioral changes following TBI, AK-7
(20 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection
twice daily for up to 7 days. SIRT2 inhibition by AK-7
resulted in a significant deterioration in behavioral competency
on days 3 and 7 post-TBI, compared with the vehicletreated
group, as evaluated by the Garcia score and the
rotarod test (Fig. S2, p < 0.05).
SIRT2 inhibition exacerbates BBB disruption
Cerebral edema is often accompanied by disruption of the
BBB. To evaluate BBB permeability after TBI, Evans blue
(EB) extravasation was evaluated. AK-7 treatment remarkably
increased EB leakage in the ipsilateral cortex (Fig. 3a),
Fig. 2 SIRT2 inhibition by AK-7 promotes

indicating that TBI-induced BBB disruption was aggravated
by SIRT2 inhibition (Fig. 3b, p < 0.001). To evaluate the
mechanism of BBB disruption after AK-7 treatment, we
conducted ZO-1/CD31 and occludin/CD31 double-immunolabeling
to observe tight junction distribution in situ 24 h
after TBI. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that in
sham mice, ZO-1 and occludin immunolabeling were located
on the endothelial cell margin of cerebral microvessels in a
continuous manner. This continuity was disrupted by TBI,
and this effect was exacerbated by SIRT2 inhibition (Fig. 3c
and d). To evaluate tight junction degradation, western blot
analysis was performed; decreased expression of ZO-1 and
occludin was observed in AK-7-treated mice at 1 and 3 days
following TBI (Fig. 3e–h).
SIRT2 inhibition increases TBI-induced MMP-9 activity
Matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-9, play an important
role in the degradation of the tight junction proteins of
the BBB. We evaluated the activity of MMP-9 in the pericontusional
cortex of the sham and TBI groups using
zymography. Tissue homogenates from each experimental
group were processed and analyzed. Zymography clearly
indicated that the up-regulation of MMP-9 activity after TBI
was significantly enhanced in response to AK-7 treatment but
that AK-7 itself has no effect on MMP-9 activity (Fig. 4a and
b). MMP-9 protein and mRNA levels were also significantly
increased by AK-7 treatment in the ipsilateral cortices at 1
and 3 days after TBI (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that
SIRT2 inhibition by AK-7 exacerbates BBB disruption at
Fig. 3 AK-7 treatment leads to increased
ZO-1 and occludin degradation and
elevated Evans blue extravasation. (a)

least in part by a mechanism involving increased MMP-9
expression and activation.
SIRT2 inhibition increases TBI-induced microglial activation
both in vivo and in vitro
Next, we investigated whether AK-7 affected microglial
activation in the TBI model. Activated microglia has
enlarged cell body with several short, thickened processes.
These morphological changes distinguish activated microglia
from resting microglia (Town et al.2005). Wefirst evaluated
microglia/macrophages activation using CD11b immunolabeling.
In the sham groups, no obvious activation of
microglia/macrophages was expected. In the vehicle group,
extensive CD11b immunolabeling was observed in the
peri-contusional regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Intraperitoneal
administration of AK-7 increased TBI-induced activation
of microglia/macrophages in the corresponding area (Fig. 5a).
Statistical analysis of the CD11b signal in mouse brain sections
indicated that AK-7 pretreatment significantly increased microglial
activation following TBI (Fig. 5c).
Previous studies have shown that CD11b and CD45
double positive cells were recognized as macrophages and
activated microglia (Perego et al. 2011). TBI-induced
microglial activation was further quantified by flow cytometry
analysis (Fig. 5b). Single-cell suspensions from the pericontusional
regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere were stained
for CD11b and CD45. As shown in Fig.5d, the number of
activated microglia and macrophages was dramatically
increased after injury as compared with sham groups, and
AK-7 significantly increased the activated microglia and
macrophages as compared with vehicle controls at indicated
time points after TBI (p < 0.05 at 1 day and p < 0.01 at
3 days, respectively).
To determine whether the SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 directly
affects TBI-induced microglial activation, primary microglia
cells were employed. Conditioned media collected from
neuronal mix culture cells 24 h post stretch-induced injury
was used to stimulate primary microglia for 6 h with or
without 10 lM AK-7. mRNA levels of inflammatory
cytokines in primary microglia were measured by qPCR.
As anticipated, conditioned media caused an increase in
mRNA levels of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a, while treatment
with SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 increased these inflammatory
cytokines’ expression by about 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 5g,
p < 0.01). These results suggest that SIRT2 inhibition
increases TBI-induced microglial activation both in vivo
and in vitro.
SIRT2 inhibition amplifies cytokine production following TBI
in vivo
Pro-inflammatory cytokines play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis
of secondary injury post-TBI, and cytokine release is
positively correlated with injury severity. We analyzed the
mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
peri-contusional regions by qPCR. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum were also measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared
with the vehicle group, the relative mRNA levels of IL-1b,
IL-6, TNF-a, MIP-2, and MCP-1 were markedly increased in
the AK-7-treated TBI group (Fig. 6a). Consistent with the
Fig. 4 SIRT2 inhibition increases traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced
MMP-9 expression and activity. (a) The MMP-9 activity in the pericontusional
cortices of mice from different experimental groups at 1
and 3 days post-TBI was assayed by zymography. (b) Western blot
analyses showed that there was a significant increase in MMP9 protein
expression in the peri-contusional area at 1 and 3 days after TBI. (c)
Bar graphs summarize the data, presented as mean  SEMs, from six
groups (n = 3 in sham groups, n = 6 in TBI groups). (d) Bar graph

qPCR results, significant increases in IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a,
MIP-2, and MCP-1 were observed in the serum of the AK-7-
treated TBI group (Fig. 6b). We also assessed the levels of
IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and found no significant
difference between the vehicle and the AK-7-treated
TBI mice (Fig. S3). Notably, AK-7 administration did not
affect cytokine production in the sham group. In summary,
these findings demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition upregulates
pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not anti-inflammatory
cytokines.
SIRT2 inhibition enhances TBI-induced NF-jB activation
NF-jB p65 is a SIRT2 substrate and is an important
modulator of AQP4 (Rao et al. 2011), multiple proinflammatory
cytokines, and MMP-9 (Rhee et al. 2007). Therefore,
we investigated whether SIRT2 participates in the TBI
process by regulating the NF-jB signaling pathway. To test
this hypothesis, we analyzed the protein levels of acetylated
and total p65 in the peri-contusional cerebral tissues from the
sham and TBI groups. As shown in Fig. 7a, the acetylation
level of p65 increased after TBI and further increased in the
group that was administered an SIRT2 inhibitor. The level of
total p65 protein was significantly up-regulated following
TBI, and AK-7 treatment did not significantly increase this
expression either in the sham or the TBI groups (Fig. 7a).
Furthermore, TBI resulted in a strong increase in NF-jB
DNA-binding activity that was markedly enhanced by SIRT2
inhibition with AK-7 (Fig. 7b). The binding specificity was
verified by incubating nuclear extracts from TBI groups with
excess unlabeled specific competitor oligonucleotide probe.
In addition, SIRT2 inhibition also affected TBI-induced
NF-jB p65 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
As shown in Fig. 7c and d, significant levels of NF-jB p65
protein localized to the nucleus following TBI, and AK-7
increased this nuclear translocation. These data indicate that
SIRT2 inhibition enhances TBI-induced NF-jB activation
possibly by increasing the acetylation and nuclear translocation
of p65.

Discussion
In recent years, SIRT2 inhibition has emerged as a strategy for
the treatment of age-related disorders (de Oliveira et al.
2012), including neurological diseases and cancer. With
respect to the brain, several studies have demonstrated a
neuroprotective effect of SIRT2 inhibition in PD (Outeiro
et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015b; Di Fruscia et al. 2015) and
HD (Pallos et al. 2008; Taylor et al. 2011; Chopra et al.
2012). In addition, SIRT2 inhibition-dependent protective
effects have been described in bacterial infection (Eskandarian
et al. 2013), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation
(Lee et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015a), and H
2
O

-induced
oxidative stress (Wang et al. 2007; Nie et al. 2014). In the
present study, we conducted tests using a selective brainpermeable
SIRT2 inhibitor, AK-7. To the best of our
knowledge, our results demonstrate for the first time that
SIRT2 inhibition exacerbates the severity of TBI, leading to
more severe brain edema, neuroinflammation, further degradation
of BBB integrity, and worsened neurological deficits.
SIRT2 is abundant in the brain and is expressed in
nearly all brain cells, although little is known about its
role in this organ (Maxwell et al. 2011). We first analyzed
the levels of SIRT2 expression in the mouse brain at
different time points after TBI. Exposure to TBI increased
SIRT2 expression in the peri-contusional regions of
the ipsilateral cortices, suggesting that SIRT2 may play
an important role in the TBI process. To evaluate this
further, we made use of a pharmacological inhibitor of
SIRT2; there are no selective SIRT2 activators currently
available. SIRT2 inhibition by AK-7 promoted cerebral
edema after TBI in a dose-dependent manner, as evaluated
by T2-weighted MRI and the wet–dry method for
water content. These results strongly support an important
role for SIRT2 in the TBI process. Brain edema has a
crucial impact on morbidity and mortality following TBI
because it increases intracranial pressure, impairs cerebral
perfusion pressure, and contributes toward delayed and
progressive brain injuries. The reduction of brain edema
is an effective treatment strategy for patients with TBI.
Further studies should be conducted to determine whether
SIRT2 activators could be used as a novel therapeutic
approach for protection against TBI-induced brain
edema.

A growing body of evidence suggests that cerebral
inflammation plays a pivotal role in the TBI process. The
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released at the
injury site spread to peri-lesional brain areas. Microglial
activation, a key process in the propagation of inflammation
to neighboring tissue, may lead to impaired neuronal survival
in the peri-lesional regions as a result of the generation of
cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it is of
great therapeutic significance to identify new strategies with
which to modulate the function and survival of microglia
following TBI. In a previous in vitro study, we demonstrated
that SIRT2 inhibition could impair microglial survival partly
by activating the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-
mediated cell death pathway (Li et al. 2013). It is imperative
to determine whether the impairment of microglial survival
induced by SIRT2 inhibition has beneficial or deleterious
effects in vivo. Our data from the present study show that
AK-7 treatment results in enhanced microglial activation
after TBI, indicating that SIRT2 inhibition might aggravate
the inflammatory response during acute TBI.
Evidence concerning a role for SIRT2 in the pathogenesis
of inflammation is somewhat inconsistent. A study of
collagen-induced arthritis suggested that SIRT2 reduces the
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates the
severity of arthritis (Lin et al. 2013). Another study, using
SIRT2 knock-out mice, revealed an increase in microglial
activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon intracortical
injection of LPS (Pais et al. 2013). SIRT2 deletion
also promotes inflammatory responses in a dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis (Lo Sasso et al.
2014). When recombined SIRT2 protein is transduced into
murine macrophages, it inhibits LPS-induced expression of
cytokines as well as activation of NF-jB and MAPKs (Kim
et al. 2013), further demonstrating a role for SIRT2 activation
in the suppression of the inflammatory response.
However, other contradictory results imply that SIRT2 might
play a detrimental role under inflammatory conditions. In one
study, SIRT2 inhibition by genetic and pharmacological
means reduced LPS-stimulated release of inflammatory
mediators and reactive oxygen species by macrophages via
a mechanism involving degradation of IjBa and nuclear
translocation of p65 (Lee et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015a).
These inconsistencies highlight the complex nature of
SIRT2-mediated effects. Because neuroinflammation plays
critical pathological roles in TBI, it is of both theoretical and
therapeutic significance to explore the role of SIRT2 in the
inflammatory response following TBI; however, no reports to
date have addressed this issue.
We have demonstrated that SIRT2 inhibition increases
the concentration of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, MIP-2, and MCP-
1, but not IL-10, at the local (cerebral tissue) and systemic
(serum) levels, and that SIRT2 inhibition increases TBI-
induced inflammatory cytokines expression in primary
microglia. These findings, in combination with previous
data, are strongly suggestive of an anti-inflammatory
function of SIRT2. Notably, inflammatory factors, including
LPS, collagen and TNF-a, reduce the levels of SIRT2
(Lin et al. 2013; Pais et al. 2013; Lo Sasso et al. 2014),
possibly accounting for the decrease in SIRT2 antiinflammatory functions. In our system, the SIRT2 protein
level was up-regulated as early as 6 h post-TBI. This may
suggest that SIRT2 is up-regulated to exert anti-inflammatory
effects and improve outcomes after TBI. However, the
mechanism responsible for SIRT2 up-regulation remains
unknown. ERK1/2 was recently shown to increase SIRT2
protein levels, stability and activity in vitro (Choi et al.
2013). Our current research, consistent with previous
studies, reveals that ERK1/2 is up-regulated following
TBI (data not show). It is rational to think that TBI-induced
SIRT2 up-regulation may be partially mediated by phosphorylation
of ERK. Further studies should be performed
to explore the underlying mechanisms by which SIRT2 is
regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels
following TBI.
Aside from enhancing the neuroinflammatory response,
SIRT2 inhibition also increases BBB permeability. In this
study, we demonstrated that AK-7 treatment results in a
significant increase in EB leakage and an exacerbation of
tight junction protein degradation, leading to worsened
outcomes in TBI mice. In this model, these effects are
partially mediated by an increase in MMP-9 expression and
activation. TBI is often accompanied by BBB disruption and
plasma components, such as macrophages, cross the compromised
BBB, aggravating inflammation, and increasing the
production of neurotoxins that can ultimately result in neuron
death. The breakdown of BBB integrity is a complex process
that is partially caused by the activation of MMPs, which is
an integral part of the neuroinflammatory response. MMPs,
which are significantly up-regulated after TBI, are considered
to be responsible for the degradation of TJ proteins,
including ZO-1 and occludin. Numerous prior studies have
indicated that activated microglia and astrocytes can release
MMPs after TBI. Hence, TBI-induced BBB disruption
facilitates the infiltration of macrophages from the blood,
which aggravates the inflammatory response and further
reduces BBB integrity. As a result, the core contusion area
spreads toward the peripheral area, triggering secondary
brain insults that could otherwise be preventable. Intriguingly
, our results clearly indicate that SIRT2 inhibition
exacerbates these pathological processes, possibly by
increasing the activation of microglia and macrophages.
NF-jB plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene
expression programs related to inflammation and brain
edema by inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and AQPs (Laird et al. 2010). SIRT2 is reported
to interact with p65, an NF-jB family member, in the
cytoplasm, and to deacetylate it at Lys310in vitroandin vivo
(Rothgiesser et al. 2010). After TNFa stimulation, p65 is

hyperacetylated in SIRT2-deficient cells, which results in
increased expression of a subset of p65 target genes
(Rothgiesser et al. 2010). We observed a similarly remarkable
post-TBI increase in acetylated p65 protein expression
and nuclear NF-jB translocation in response to SIRT2
inhibition by AK-7. This is in agreement with recent reports
that have indicated that SIRT2 targets Lys310 of p65 to
influence pro-inflammatory gene transcription in microglia
(Linet al.2013; Paiset al.2013). Phosphorylation of p65 on
serine 536, another parameter associated with NF-jB
activation, can increase acetylation on lysine 310 (Chen
et al. 2005); however, we did not observe that its phosphorylation
is affected by SIRT2 inhibition after TBI (Fig. S5).
Together, these data indicate that post-translational deacetylation
of p65 by SIRT2 might be one of the mechanisms that
contribute toward its anti-inflammatory properties.
A neuroprotective effect of SIRT2 inhibition was recently
confirmed in models of PD but not in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and ischemic stroke (Chen et al. 2015b). This
highlights the specificity of protective effects of AK-7 in PD.
Although neurodegenerative diseases and TBI share many
pathological features, we show here that SIRT2 is an
inhibitor of the neuroinflammatory response to TBI and that
SIRT2 inhibition aggravates TBI severity. Our findings
imply that any treatment that could affect the activity of
SIRT2 should be regarded with caution. Further studies are
required to develop SIRT2 activators and to validate their
protective effects in TBI.
