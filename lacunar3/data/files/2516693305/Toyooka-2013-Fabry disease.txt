INTRODUCTION
Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder
caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal glycohydrolase a-galactosidase A. The enzyme defect leads
to the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide
(GL-3) and related glycosphingolipids, within
vascular endothelial cells, a range of renal cell types,
myocardial cells, and dorsal root ganglia neuronal cells.
First manifestations involve small nerve fibers of the
peripheral and autonomic nervous system. This neuropathy
is associated with decreased thermal sensation, particularly
to cold, with relative preservation of large fiber
function, such as vibration detection. Neuropathic pain
and hypohidrosis are the main sources of lower quality
of life. With age, the incidence of life-threatening complications
involving the kidney, heart, and brain progresses.
Both life expectancy and quality of life are
severely compromised.
Recently it has been reported that carrier women
develop symptoms of Fabry disease including peripheral
neuropathy at a higher rate than previously shown
and they are at a higher risk of multiple organ failure
and premature death. Apart from classic Fabry disease,
atypical variants have been introduced, which are still
underestimated.
With the development of enzyme replacement therapy
(ERT) using recombinant human a-galactosidase
A, early initiation of ERT before the appearance of irreversible
organ failure is emphasized and its long-term
outcome is currently being investigated.
HISTORICALASPECTS
The original clinical descriptions of patients who are now
known as having Fabry disease were given separately by
two dermatologists, Johannes Fabry in Germany and
William Anderson in England in 1898 (Anderson, 1898;
Fabry, 1898). They used the term “angiokeratoma corporis” and “purpura papulosa haemorrhagica” for this
unusual skin condition. The accumulated substrates in
the kidney of patients with Fabry disease were identified
as ceramidetrihexoside, now generally referred to as
globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and galabiosylceramide
(Sweeley and Klionsky, 1963). The enzymatic defect in
Fabry disease was established as insufficient activity of
the enzyme ceramidetrihexosidase (a-galactosidase A)
that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal
molecule of galactose from accumulating GL-3 (Brady
et al., 1967). A simple and reliable diagnostic method
was established and it was found that the leukocytes
of male patients with Fabry disease were deficient in
a-galactosidase and the level of its activity in leukocytes
from female carriers was 15 to 40% of that in normal
leukocytes (Kint, 1970).
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence of Fabry disease has been estimated as one
in 40 000 to one in 117 000 live births (Meikle et al., 1999;
Desnick et al., 2001). Presenting symptoms are not
always specific, so Fabry disease is probably underestimated.
Screening of newborns in Italy revealed that
the incidence of a-galactosidase A deficiency was 1 in
3100 male babies with an 11:1 ratio of patients with the
later-onset:classic phenotypes, raising the possibility that
later-onset variants are more frequent than has been previously
reported (Spada et al., 2006).
CLINICALMANIFESTATIONS
Classic Fabry disease
Symptoms of the disease typically occur during childhood
or adolescence with recurrent episodes of severe
burning pain in the extremities, angiokeratomas,

hypohidrosis, and cornea verticillata (Brady and
Schiffmann, 2000; Zarate and Hopkin, 2008).
Early symptoms
Pain is one of the most disabling complications. Two
types of pain have been reported: severe episodes of limb
pain, called Fabry crises, typically start with hands and
feet and radiate proximally and are frequently triggered
by environmental factors including change of temperature
, stress, and exercise; the other is chronic burning
and tingling pain. The presence of neuropathic pain
was reported in 62–82% of males and in 41–70% of
females (MacDermot et al., 2001a, b; Eng et al., 2007;
Hoffmann et al., 2007a). Fabry crises can be associated
with fever, arthralgia, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation
rate and may be misdiagnosed as rheumatic
fever, rheumatoid arthritis, erythromelalgia, or other
collagen diseases.
Angiokeratomas, reddish-purple skin lesions, are
seen in the umbilical, scrotal, inguinal, and gluteal
lesions. They increase in number and size with age.
Angiokeratomas were reported in 66–71% of males
and in 35–36% of females (MacDermot et al., 2001a,
b; Orteu et al., 2007). Angiokeratomas are a clue for
diagnosis. The presence of cutaneous vascular lesions
was correlated with the severity of the systemic manifestations
of the disease (pain, renal failure, cardiac
disease, and premature cerebrovascular disease) as
assessed by a severity scoring system (Orteu et al.,
2007). Telangiectasia and lymphoedema have also been
reported (Orteu et al., 2007).
Hypohidrosis is a classic feature of Fabry disease.
Decreasedsweatingleadstoheatandexerciseintolerance.
The prevalence of hypohidrosis was reported in 53–56%
of males and in 28–33% of females (MacDermot et al.,
2001a, b; Orteu et al., 2007). On the contrary, hyperhidrosis also occurs, with female predominance (6.4% in males
vs. 11.9% in females) (Lidove et al., 2006).
Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting
, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, are associated with
meals and cause difficulties with gaining weight. The
reported prevalence was variable (19–69% in males vs.
13–58% in females) (MacDermot et al., 2001a, b; Eng
et al., 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2007b). In one report,
female patients were more frequently affected than
male patients, and there was a high prevalence in children
(Hoffmann et al., 2007b).
In Fabry disease, ophthalmological abnormalities
occur mostly at the level of the conjunctival and retinal
vessels, the cornea, and the lens. Cornea verticillata
was reported in 73.5% of males and 76.9% of females;
vessel tortuosity was observed in 48.7% of males and
21.9% of females (Sodi et al., 2007). As these signs
can be detected by a basic slit-lamp examination, ophthalmological
examination is useful and essential for
early diagnosis.
Hearing difficulty and paroxysmal vertigo are also
observed. Self-reported hearing loss was seen in 41%
of males, but more frequent sensorimotor deafness
was confirmed in 78% by audiogram (MacDermot
et al., 2001a). Hearing ability of Fabry disease is significantlyworse than in an age-matched general population,
but leads to clinically relevant hearing impairment in
only 16% of cases (Hegemann et al., 2006). A correlation
of neuropathic and vascular damage with hearing loss
was suggested in males and residual a-galactosidase A
activity appears to have a protective effect against hearing
loss (Ries et al., 2007).
Renal involvement
The first clinical signs of nephropathy include microalbuminuria
, proteinuria, and subsequently progressive
decline in glomerular filtration rate occurring if a critical
number of nephrons have been damaged as a result of
interstitial scarring, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular
atrophy. Progress to end-stage renal disease requiring
dialysis or transplantation occurs by the fifth decade
of life (Thadhani et al., 2002). Baseline proteinuria,
reduced glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, and
male gender were associated with more rapid progression
of Fabry nephropathy (Schiffmann et al., 2009).
Cardiac involvement
Cardiac involvement is present early in life but is not
detected clinically until the third or fourth decade
(Mehta et al., 2004). Cardiovascular manifestations
include arrhythmia, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular
dysfunction, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction,
and heart failure (Linhart and Elliot, 2007; Zarate and
Hopkin, 2008). Although classic cardiac abnormality is
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias may be
caused without left ventricular hypertrophy. Disease
evolution in the heart is characterized initially by myocardial
hypertrophy. As the disease progresses interstitial
abnormalities and replacement myocardial fibrosis
are seen. Cardiac disease in Fabry disease is associated
with GL-3 accumulation in all cellular components of
the heart, including cardiomyocytes, conduction system
cells, valvular fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and vascular
smooth muscle cells. While GL-3 accumulation is histologically
the most important feature, it represents only
1–2% of the total cardiac mass. So it seems that disease
in the heart results from activation of other signaling
pathways that lead to hypertrophy, apoptosis, necrosis,
and fibrosis (Linhart and Elliot, 2007).

Cerebrovascular involvement
Strokes and transient ischemic attacks have been frequently
seen in patients with Fabry disease. The most
frequent symptoms and signs were as follows: hemiparesis
, vertigo/dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, nystagmus,
nausea/vomiting, head pain, hemiataxia and ataxia of
gait in the hemizygote group; memory loss, dizziness,
ataxia, hemiparesis, loss of consciousness, and hemisensory
symptoms in the heterozygote group (Mitsias and
Levine, 1996). Psychiatric behavior and dementia have
also been attributed to the cerebral vasculopathy
(Okeda and Nisihara, 2008). The cerebral vasculopathy
consists of ischemic strokes including large and small
vessels. The neuronal accumulation of glycosphingolipids
appears to have no clinical effect on the natural history
of Fabry disease with the possible exception of some
reported mild cognitive abnormalities (Moore et al.,
2007). The most prominent MRI finding was severe
progressive white matter lesions. Hyperintensity in the
pulvinar on T1-weighted images is a common finding
in Fabry disease, likely reflecting the presence of calcification
(Moore et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2003). The
pulvinar sign is highly specific to Fabry disease and is
found in male patients with cardiac signs and severe
renal involvement (Burlina et al., 2008). Although progressive white matter lesions at early age, increased signal
intensity in the pulvinar, and tortuosity and dilatation
of the large vessels are well known on cranial MRI,
increased basilar artery diameter has been shown to be
superior for separating patients with Fabry disease from
controls with an accuracy of 87% (Fellgiebel et al., 2009).
Themean age of onset of symptomatic cerebrovascular
disease was 38.4 years in the male stroke patients, and
40.3 years in the female group (Rolfs et al., 2005).
Accordingto the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) database,
heterozygous women are more likely to experience
stroke (27%) than men (12%). The mean age at onset
of stroke was 28.8 years in men and 43.3 years in women
(Mehta et al., 2004). Data from the Fabry Registry
showed the prevalence of strokes was estimated as
6.9% in males and 4.3% in females. Median age at first
stroke was 39.0 years in males and 45.7 years in females.
Most patients (70.9% of males and 76.9% of females)
experienced their first stroke before renal or cardiac
events. Fifty percent of males and 38.3% of females
experienced their first stroke before being diagnosed
with Fabry disease (Sims et al., 2009). The higher frequency of infarctions in the vertebrobasilar area
(46.4% Fabry vs. 21.4% non-Fabry) correlated with more
pronounced changes in the vertebrobasilar vessels like
dolichoectatic pathology (42.9% vs. 6.8%) (Rolfs et al.,
2005). Fabry disease must be considered in all cases of
unexplained stroke in young patients, especially in cases
with a combination of infarction in the vertebrobasilar
artery system and proteinuria (Rolfs et al., 2005).
The pathogenesis of Fabry vasculopathy remains
poorly understood, but is associated with abnormal
functional control of the vessel secondary to endothelial
dysfunction, cerebral hyper-perfusion, and a prothrombotic
state with likely increased production of reactive
oxygen species (Moore et al., 2007). A patient with progressive brainstem features was initially misdiagnosed
as having multiple sclerosis (Lehmann et al., 2006).
Misdiagnosis of Fabry disease is common. The mean
delay from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis
was 13.7 years in males and 16.3 years in females
(Mehta et al., 2004).
Outcome
Death occurs from complications of renal disease, cardiac
involvement, and/or cerebrovascular disease. The
median cumulative survival was reported to be 50 years
in hemizygous males and 70 years in obligate carrier
females (MacDermot et al., 2001a, b). Recently accordingto the Fabry Registry, the average life expectancy of
males with Fabry disease was reported to be 58.2 years
and that of females 75.4 years (Waldek et al., 2009).
The most common cause of death among both genders
was cardiovascular disease. Most (57%) of patients who
died of cardiovascular disease had previously received
renal replacement therapy (Waldek et al., 2009). According to FOS database, the principal cause of death was
shifting away from renal failure to cardiac disease
(Mehta et al., 2009a).
Female heterozygotes
Female carriers for the classic phenotype have a range of
clinical presentations due to random X-inactivation,
ranging from being asymptomatic or having mild manifestations
in the majority to rare carriers who are as seriously
affected as males (Willard, 2001).
In a cross-sectional study of a large cohort, cardiac,
renal, or cerebrovascular abnormalities were documented
in 52 of the 57 women (91%) with confirmed Fabry
genotypes (Gupta et al., 2005). Heterozygotes suffered
from significant multisystemic disease and reduced
quality of life. Fatigue, present in 59%, was associated
with reduced maximum oxygen consumption and exercise
intolerance, present in 83%, was associated with
reduced maximum heart rate during exercise testing
(Wang et al., 2007). Of the 1077 enrolled females in
the Fabry Registry, 69.4% had symptoms and signs of
Fabry disease. The median age at onset was 13 years.
Twenty percent of females experienced major cerebrovascular
, cardiac, or renal events at a median age of
46 years (Wilcox et al., 2008). Although it was previously

thought that serious manifestations are seen only in
hemizygous males, female heterozygotes for Fabry disease
have a significant risk for major organ involvement
and decreased quality of life and must be regularly monitored
for signs and symptoms.
Atypical variants of Fabry disease
Late-onset Fabry disease with manifestations of cardiovascular
, renal, and cerebrovascular disease may be
underestimated.
CARDIAC VARIANT
Screening of 230 Japanese male patients with left ventricular
hypertrophy by plasmaa-galactosidase A assays
revealed that 3% of patients were previously unrecognized
“cardiac variants” (Nakao et al., 1995). Recently
a screening study of 508 patients (328 males and 180
females) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy reported
that 1% of patients had undiagnosed Fabry disease
(Monserrat et al., 2007).
RENAL VARIANT
Following measurement of plasma a-galactosidase A
activity in a series of 514 consecutive, unrelated Japanese
male patients undergoing hemodialysis previously diagnosed
with “chronic glomerulonephritis”, six (1.2%)
patients were revealed as having Fabry disease. None
of them had angiokeratoma or corneal and lenticular
dystrophy (Nakao et al., 2003).
CEREBROVASCULAR VARIANT
A screening study of 721 German adults aged 18 to 55
years who had had strokes of unknown etiology reported
that 4.9% of males and 2.4% of females had Fabry disease.
Based on this data, it is estimated that Fabry disease
is responsible for 1.2% of cryptogenic strokes in patients
younger than 55 years (Rolfs et al., 2005). Screening of
young patients presenting with cerebrovascular disease
in Belgium revealed that a-galactosidase A deficiency
may play a role in up to 1% of cases (Brouns et al., 2010).
PERIPHERALNEUROPATHYAND
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Early symptoms in Fabry patients include burning pain in
the hands and feet, hypohidrosis, and gastrointestinal
symptoms. Detailed neurophysiological examination
revealed small fiber dysfunction was more prominent
than large fiber dysfunction (D€ utsch et al., 2002;
Luciano et al., 2002). It is generally agreed that cold perception is conveyed primarily by small myelinated (A-d)
fibers and warm perception is conveyed by unmyelinated
(C) fibers, as well as that conventional nerve conduction
studies and vibratory detection threshold assess the
function of large myelinated fibers (A-a and A-b).
One group showed that nerve conduction studies in
patients with Fabry disease were mostly normal except
for an increased frequency of median nerve entrapment
(27%) at the wrist and sympathetic skin responses were
preserved (95%) (Luciano et al., 2002). Another group
found lower compound muscle action potentials, lower
sensory action potentials, and lower amplitude of sympathetic
skin responses in Fabry patients as compared
to controls (D€ utsch et al., 2002 ). Quantitative sensory
testing showed increased or unmeasurable cold and
warm detection thresholds in patients, which were significantly
different from controls in the hand and foot.
Cold thresholds were more severely impaired than warm
thresholds. A consistent pattern of thermo-hypoesthesia,
affecting the feet more than hands, was seen (Luciano
et al., 2002). Neurophysiologically, it was shown that
the peripheral neuropathy in Fabry disease was characterized
by thermal afferent fiber dysfunction in a
length-dependent fashion, with greater impairment of
cold than warm sensation, and relative preservation
of large myelinated fiber function. Clinical peripheral
neuropathy that predominately affected thermal sensation
with variable involvement of pinprick and light
touch was shown in 20 male and 2 female Australian
patients. Quantitative sensory testing confirmed these
findings (Low et al., 2007). Decreased sweating was
also demonstrated by thermoregulatory sweat test and
quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (Schiffmann
et al., 2003).
Suralnerve biopsy specimens from hemizygous male
and heterozygous female Fabry patients showed dense,
osmiophilic, lamellated bodies in the endothelial cells,
pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, as
well as in the circumferential and fascicle-separating
perineurial cells. In the endoneurial cells the lamellated
bodies were numerous and pleomorphic, but capillaries
were not occluded. On electron microscopy, 2.1 nm-thick
dense lines were assembled into 5.4 nm periodicity
(Figs. 37.1 to 37.4). Histograms of myelinated fibers
(MFs) and unmyelinated fibers (UFs) showed that small
MFs and UFs were relatively selectively decreased in a
hemizygous male and to a lesser extent, in a symptomatic
heterozygous female (Toyooka and Said, 1997;
Figs. 37.5 and 37.6). In addition to this preferential
loss of small MFs and UFs (Ohnishi and Dyck, 1974;
Tabira et al., 1974; Tome ´ et al., 1977; Mutoh et al.,
1988), preferential loss of small neurons in the dorsal
root ganglia has also been reported (Ohnishi and
Dyck,1974). On the other hand, a few authors have demonstrated the preferential depletion of large MFs (Vital
et al., 1984).

Symptoms of peripheral nervous system and autonomic
dysfunction might be related to the storage of
GL-3 in dorsal root ganglion cells and autonomic ganglion
cells. Neuropathologically, extensive GL-3 accumulation
has been reported in neurons of sympathetic
and dorsal root ganglia in hemizygotes (Tabira et al.,

1974; Kaye et al., 1988). The most dramatic GL-3
increases occurred in the dorsal root ganglia, choroid
plexus, and leptomeninges – a more than 150-fold
increase in some males (Kaye et al., 1988). The permeable
blood–brain barrier and blood–nerve barrier regions of
the central and peripheral nervous systems contained
increased quantities of GL-3. In the symptomatic heterozygous
female, the accumulations of GL-3 in spinal and
sympathetic ganglia were 34 and 48 times the amount in
normal controls, respectively (Hozumi et al., 1989). The
pathophysiology of the painful attacks in Fabry disease
has not been elucidated. Significant accumulation of glycolipids
in dorsal root ganglia may support the hypothesis
that painful attacks are caused by involvement of this
lesion. Another possible hypothesis is an increase in the
number of small regenerating UFs as seen in some cases
(Ohnishi and Dyck,1974; Tabira et al., 1974; Toyooka and
Said, 1997), but not in the heterozygote without painful
episodes (Mutoh et al., 1988). Hyperexcitability and
spontaneous firing of sprouting (regenerating) unmyelinated
neuritis arising from nociceptive axons have
been suggested as a pain mechanism of peripheral nerve
origin (Asbury and Fields, 1984). In addition, glycosphingolipid
deposition in the small vessels that supply blood
to the peripheral nerve might contribute to neuropathic
pain. The endothelial glycosphingolipid accumulation
might narrow the vascular lumen, and vessel spasms
or frank infarction might cause the excruciating pain
(Mehta and Hughes, 2002).
Using skin biopsy specimens, Scott et al. (1999)
described severe loss of intraepidermal innervation at
the ankle and less severe loss at the distal thigh was
shown in hemizygotes. They demonstrated a lengthdependence
on the distribution of nerve damage that

was consistent with the length-dependent abnormality
of thermal afferents as shown before (Luciano et al.,
2002). Although the gold standard for identifying and
quantitating small fiber neuropathy is nerve biopsy,
the advantage of skin biopsy over nerve biopsy is the
possibility of repeating performances to check the severity
of neuropathy and the degree of regenerating process
followed by ERT.
Recent studies suggested that heterozygous female
Fabry patients develop peripheral neuropathy. In 12
women with Fabry disease, 10 had symptoms of small
fiber neuropathy, and five had decreased intraepidermal
nerve fiber density (IENFD) or thermal hypoesthesia
(Laaksonen et al., 2008). In a study of 19 female patients
withFabry disease (Torvin Moller et al., 2009), daily pain
was present in 63% of patients, with a mean visual analog
scale (VAS) score of 4.0. Tactile detection threshold
and pressure pain threshold were lower and cold detection
thresholds were increased in patients. Sensory nerve
action potential amplitude and maximal sensory conduction
velocity values did not differ from those of controls,
whereas there was a highly significant reduction in
IENFD. No correlation between pain VAS score, quantitative
sensory testing, and IENFD was found (Torvin
Moller et al., 2009). Following skin biopsy, it was suggested that heterozygous Fabry females, although
asymptomatic, might have somatic and autonomic small
fiber neuropathy in a length-dependent fashion (Liguori
et al., 2010).
Numerous characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions were
observed in the eccrine sweat glands and the small vessels
around the eccrine glands may be responsible for the
decreased sweating ability (Lao et al., 1998). Acute
improvement in sweat function 24–72 h post enzyme
infusion suggests that the hypohidrosis in Fabry disease
is partly due to a functional defect at the sweat gland
level rather than to a gross structural abnormality
(Schiffmann et al., 2003).
By means of noncontact corneal aesthesiometry to
quantify loss of corneal sensation and the novel noninvasive
techniques of corneal confocal microscopy to
quantify small fiber neuropathy, early small nerve fiber
damage and dysfunction were detected (Tavakoli et al.,
2009). This was in good accordance with previous observations in sural nerve and skin biopsies.
GENETICS
Thea-galactosidase A gene (GLA) is located on the long
arm of the X chromosome, in position Xq22, spans
approximately 12 kb of genomic DNA, and contains
seven exons (Kornreich et al., 1989). The complementary
DNA is 1290 bases and encodes a polypeptide of 429
amino acids including a 31 amino acid signal peptide.
The structure is a homodimer of approximately
101 kDa with each monomer containing a (beta/alpha)
8 domain with the active site and an antiparallel beta
domain. N-linked carbohydrate appears at six sites in
the glycoprotein dimer, revealing the basis for lysosomal
transport via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Bishop
et al., 1986; Garman and Garboczi, 2004).
Newly synthesized a-galactosidase A protein traverses
the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it receives
N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Subsequently it
passes through the Golgi apparatus where the oligosaccharide
side chains undergo a series of posttranslational
modifications. It receives the mannose-6-phosphate
recognition marker. Αlpha-galactosidase A bearing
mannose-6-phosphate marker, which binds to the
mannose-6-phosphatereceptorinthetrans-Golginetwork,
is packed into clathrin-coated vesicles and transported to
endosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989). Due to the
low pH in this cellular compartment the receptor–ligand
complexes dissociate and a-galactosidase A is delivered
to lysosomes.Αlpha-galactosidase A, which does
not receive the mannose-6-phosphate recognition
marker in the Golgi apparatus, is secreted. This extracellular a-galactosidase A can bind to plasma membrane
located mannose-6-phosphate receptors, which
mediates its endocytosis and transport to the lysosomes.
This mechanism is an essential prerequisite
for the effectiveness of ERT (Ghosh et al., 2003).
More than 500 mutations have been identified in the
gene fora-galactosidase A (TheHuman Gene Mutation
Database at the Institute of Medical Genetics in Cardiff,
2011). Point mutations (missense or nonsense mutations)
are the most frequent, but small and large deletions,
splicing mutations, or insertions are also seen.
Mutations leading to complete loss of function of the
gene product are associated with classic forms of the disease
, whereas mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions
might occasionally be associated with a milder
phenotype and late variants. Efforts to establish genotype
–phenotype correlation have been limited because
each family with Fabry disease has a private mutation.
Genotype/phenotype correlations revealed that certain
mutations previously found in mild variant patients were
also found in classic patients, suggesting that other modifying
factors are involved in disease expression
(Ashton-Prolla et al., 2000).
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is frequently delayed because of the nonspecific
nature of symptoms and signs. Suspicion of the
possibility of having Fabry disease is important. Delay
in diagnosis from onset of neuropathic pain was a mean
of 8.18 years and from onset of angiokeratoma was a
FABRY DISEASE 635
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-996927000)
mean of 10.7 years (MacDermot et al., 2001a). The
diagnosis was often made incidentally and recognition
of cornea verticillata or angiokeratoma by ophthalmologists
or dermatologists, respectively, was high
(MacDermot et al., 2001a).
In males, screening for greatly deficient or absentagalactosidase
A activity in plasma or peripheral leukocytes
, or gene sequencing should be done. In females,
measurement of a-galactosidase A enzyme activity is
unreliable because many carrier females have normal
activity (Linthorst et al., 2005). Molecular genetic testing
is the most reliable method for the diagnosis of carrier
females.
TREATMENT
An international panel of physicians with expertise in
Fabry disease has proposed guidelines for the recognition
, evaluation, and surveillance of disease-associated
morbidities, as well as therapeutic strategies (Eng
et al., 2006).
Conventional therapy
NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Based upon self-assessment of pain levels, carbamazepine
showed moderate to complete relief for severe
pain of Fabry disease. But preexisting autonomic dysfunctions
such as ileus, urinary retention, and gastrointestinal
disturbance were exacerbated in some
patients (Filling-Katz et al., 1989). Neuropathic pain
wasdecreased compared with baseline using the anticonvulsant
gabapentin, as measured using the Brief Pain
Inventory (Ries et al., 2003).
GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCE
For the delayed gastric emptying shown by radionuclide
gastric emptying studies, motility agents such as metoclopramide
are reported to produce symptomatic or
sometimes functional improvement (Argoff et al., 1998).
RENAL INVOLVEMENT
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) might be useful
to reduce proteinuria. Normalization of blood pressure
is important to preserve renal function. For end-stage
renal involvement of Fabry disease, renal dialysis and
renal transplantation are the choices.
CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT
Treatment of symptomatic heart disease in patients with
Fabry disease is similar to that for those who have
the same cardiac problems but from other causes.
Conventional treatment with ACE inhibitors and
diuretics should be used in patients with evidence of systolic
impairment. In patients with supraventricular
rhythm disturbances, anticoagulant treatment should
be initiated. A permanent cardiac pacemaker is used
for patients with higher degrees of A-V block. Patients
with chest pain should receive conventional anti-anginal
treatment together with antiplatelet treatment. For
advanced congestive heart failure heart transplantation
may be considered, as the intrinsic enzyme production
within the graft should prevent reoccurrence of disease
(Linhart and Elliot, 2007).
CEREBROVASCULAR INVOLVEMENT
Administration of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents
are recommended for preventing strokes, but this
approach is not sufficient.
Enzyme replacement therapy
ERT was the first specific therapy for Fabry disease and it
has been available since 2001. Two forms of
a-galactosidase A are available: agalsidase alfa (ReplagalR: Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Boston, MA,
USA) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week; agalsidase
beta (FabrazymeR: Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge,
MA, USA) at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg every other week. Agalsidase
alfa is produced in a human fibroblast cell line and
agalsidase beta in a Chinese hamster ovary host cell line.
They are functionally indistinguishable, with comparable
specific activities per milligram and glycosylation patterns
(Lee et al., 2003). Infused a-galactosidase A can
bind to plasma membrane located mannose-6-phosphate
receptors, which mediates its endocytosis and transports
to the lysosomes. During the treatment about half of
the patients experienced mild-to-moderate infusion
reactions (i.e., rigors and fever) (Eng et al., 2001;
Schiffmann et al., 2001). All were transient and managed
conservatively. IgG seroconversion occurred in 88% who
received agalsidase beta (Eng et al., 2001). Infusionassociated reactions decreased over time, as did antirh- a-galactosidase A IgG antibody titers (Wilcox
et al., 2004). Agalsidase beta therapy could be successfully reinstated in patients with Fabry disease who have
developed IgE antibodies or skin test reactivity to the
recombinant enzyme (Wilcox et al., 2004; Bodensteiner
et al., 2008). The main problems of ERT are repeated
intravenous infusion and high costs.
NEUROPATHY, PAIN, HYPOHIDROSIS
Schiffmann et al. (2001) demonstrated in a 6-month
double-blind placebo-controlled study that ERT (agalsidase
alfa 0.2 mg/kg every other week) significantly
636 K. TOYOOKA
( 8.0.0.2542.1416083037 PDF Extractor SDK EVAL VERSION)
reduced neuropathic pain and use of pain medications,
and improved pain-related quality of life and renal
pathology. There was an approximately 50% reduction
in plasma GL-3 levels, a significant improvement in cardiac
conduction, and a significant increase in body
weight. In the same cohort, 3-year open-label extension
of ERT lead to a modest but significant improvement
in the clinical manifestations of small fiber neuropathy
showing reduced neuropathic pain, improved sweating,
and reduced detection threshold for cold and warm temperatures
in the hands and feet (Schiffmann et al., 2003).
It was investigated whether this kind of functional
improvement associated with ERT corresponded to
increased IENFD. After 6 months of placebo-controlled
study followed by an additional 12 months of open-label
ERT, there were no significant differences in IENFD
between the enzyme and the placebo groups. Furthermore
, after an additional year of ERT, there was a
significant reduction in IENFD in the patient group,
attributed to the declining glomerular filtration rate.
Thermal thresholds remained unchanged. So it was
concluded that epidermal nerve fiber regeneration did
not occur after 12–18 months of ERT (Schiffmann
etal., 2006a). According to the FOS database, agalsidase
alfaimproved pain score and quality of life in a cohort of
314 patients who were receiving ERT (Beck et al., 2004).
As previously shown, vibratory, cold, and heat–pain
detection threshold testing adequately characterizes
Ab-, Ad-, and C-fiber dysfunction in Fabry patients
(Dutsch et al., 2002). Hilz et al. (2004b) showed that
ERT with agalsidase beta 1.0 mg/kg every other week
significantly improved function of C-, Ad-, and Abnerve
fibers and intradermal vibration receptors in Fabry
neuropathy by performing quantitative sensory testing.
Lack of recovery in some patients with severe dysfunction
of thermal perception suggested that early ERT,
prior to irreversible nerve fiber loss, was necessary.
In the double-blind placebo-controlled study of ERT
(agalsidase beta 1 mg/kg every other week), Eng et al.
(2001) reported significant improvements in pain scores
after 20 weeks of treatment in both treatment groups.
There was no significant difference between groups in
any pain assessment, possibly because of low scores at
base line and placebo effect. In this double-blind study,
20 of 29 patients in the agalsidase beta treated group had
no renal microvascular endothelial deposits of GL-3, as
compared with none of 29 patients in the placebo group
(p<0.001). Patients treated with agalsidase beta also had
decreased deposits of GL-3 in the skin (p<0.001) and
heart (p<0.001) compared with placebo patients.
Plasma concentrations of GL-3 were undetectable after
week 20 in all 20 patients who had no deposits of GL-3 in
renal biopsy. During the open-label extension study of 30
months, five of 58 patients stopped all pain medications
and six of 58 patients had a reduction on dose and/or frequency
of their pain medications (Wilcox et al., 2004).
The final extension study of 54 months showed significant
improvement in pain scores (Germain et al., 2007).
Although based on a small number of patients, ERT
with agalsidase alfa was reported to reverse the hearing
deterioration gradually (Hajioff et al., 2003).
RENAL INVOLVEMENT
According to the FOS database, treatment with agalsidase
alfa stabilized renal function in patients with a mild
or moderate deterioration in renal function at baseline
(Beck et al., 2004). In an open-label extension study after
a 6-month randomized placebo-controlled study, estimated
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained stable
in subgroups of patients with Stage I (GFR>90 mL/
minute) or Stage II (GFR 60–89 mL/minute) chronic kidney
disease at baseline. In contrast, in the subgroup of
patients with Stage III chronic kidney disease (GFR
30–59 ml/min), the slope of the decline in GFR was
reduced compared with comparable historical controls,
suggesting that ERT was slowing the decline of renal
function (Schiffmann et al., 2006b). In an open-label,
phaseIII extension study after a 20-week, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study of agalsidase
beta, patients older than 40 years who had significant
proteinuria at baseline and evidence of sclerotic
glomeruli pretreatment showed renal disease progression
(Germain et al., 2007).
CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT
According to the FOS database, treatment with agalsidase
alfa reduced left ventricular size in patients who
had an enlarged heart at baseline (Beck et al., 2004).
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study, left ventricular mass, as measured by MRI, was
significantly reduced following 6 months of treatment
with agalsidase alfa compared with placebo (p¼0.041),
and a mean 20% reduction in myocardial GL-3 contents
assessed by serial intravenous endocardial biopsies was
demonstrated over 6 months of enzyme replacement
compared to a mean 10% increase in patients receiving
placebo (p¼0.42). ERT resulted in regression of
the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Fabry disease
(Hughes et al., 2008).
In another study, it was examined whether ERT was
effective in all stages of Fabry cardiomyopathy during
long-term follow-up. In patients without fibrosis, ERT
(agalsidase beta) resulted in a significant reduction in
left ventricular mass, an improvement in myocardial
function, and a higher exercise capacity. In contrast,
patients with mild or severe fibrosis showed a minor
reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy and no
FABRY DISEASE 637
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
improvement in myocardial function or exercise capacity
(Weidemann et al., 2009). Hence, it seems that once
irreversible fibrosis occurs, ERT is no longer effective.
Long-term treatment with recombinant human
a-galactosidase A (agalsidase beta) may halt the progression
of vascular pathology and prevent the clinical
manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (Thurberg
et al., 2009).
CEREBROVASCULAR INVOLVEMENT
Patients with Fabry disease were reported to have elevated
cerebral blood flow velocities assessed with transcranial
Doppler (Moore et al., 2002). In a 6-month,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of agalsidase alfa
followed by an 18-month open-label trial, these velocities
significantly decreased (Moore et al., 2002). On the contrary
, reduced cerebral blood flow velocities and
impaired cerebral autoregulation were shown in patients
with Fabry disease using transcranial Doppler (Hilz et al.,
2004a), and these observations are still under discussion.
Although functional improvement of cerebral blood
flow could be obtained, four of 25 patients receiving
long-term therapy with agalsidase alfa for 4 to 4.5 years
suffered a cerebrovascular accident or a transient ischemic
attack (Schiffmann et al., 2006b). Five of 17 men and
two of six women receiving agalsidase beta demonstrated
neurological deterioration, especially those who
had preexisting cerebrovascular disease before starting
ERT (Buechner et al., 2008). Neither agalsidase alfa
nor agalsidase beta cross the blood–brain barrier. Evidence
of a favorable impact of ERT on central nervous
system signs and symptoms has not been established
(Salviati et al., 2010). The long-term clinical effects of
ERT on cerebral vasculopathy still needs to be fully
assessed.
GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCE
After 6–7 months of agalsidase beta therapy, all four
patients reported no or only occasional abdominal pain
or diarrhea, and gained 3–8 kg in weight (Banikazemi
et al., 2005).
BASICRESEARCH
Animal models
Knockout mice and transgenic mice for Fabry disease
have been generated (Ohshima et al., 1997; Shimmoto
et al., 1997). These animal models have been used for
experiments with bone marrow transplantation, ERT,
and gene therapy (Ohshima et al., 1999; Jung et al.,
2001; Takahashi et al., 2002; Ishii et al., 2004; Tajima
et al., 2009). Positive results have been reported.
Gene replacement therapy
A recombinant adeno-associated viral vector encoding
human a-galactosidase A (rAAV-AGA) was injected
into the hepatic portal vein (Jung et al., 2001) or into
the right quadriceps muscles (Takahashi et al., 2002)
of Fabry mice. In parallel to the elevated enzyme
levels, a significant reduction in GL-3 levels was seen.
AAV-mediated gene transfer might be useful for
the treatment of Fabry disease (Jung et al., 2001;
Takahashi et al., 2002).
Chemical chaperone therapy
Chemical chaperone therapy has recently emerged as a
potential therapeutic alternative for Fabry disease.
Chemical chaperones are small molecules that bind to
mutant enzyme proteins and assist in their correct folding
, maturation, and trafficking to their functional site,
such as the lysosomes (Yam et al., 2005; Motabar et al.,
2010). Oral administration of 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin
(DGJ), a potent competitive inhibitor ofa-galactosidase
A, to transgenic mice expressing human R301Q agalactosidase
A yielded higher a-galactosidase A activity
in major tissues (Fan and Ishii, 2007). DGJ (marketed
as AmigalTM by Amicus Therapeutics, Cranbury, NJ,
USA) is currently being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial
as a chaperone therapeutic agent for Fabry disease.
Modified a–N-acetylgalactosaminidase
A modifieda–N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA) with
a-galactosidase A-like substrate specificity was
designed and produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
The enzyme acquired the ability to catalyze the degradation
of 4-methylumbelliferyl- a–D-galactopyranoside.
The enzyme cleaved GL-3 accumulated in cultured fibroblasts
from a patient with Fabry disease. This modified
NAGA is hardly expected to cause an allergic reaction,
so it is highly promising as a new and safe enzyme for
ERT for Fabry disease (Tajima et al., 2009).
Induced pluripotent stem cells
Recently iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells generated
from mouse models of Fabry disease demonstrated
defects in disease-specific enzyme activities and significant
accumulation of substrates for their enzymes.
Functional cardiomyocytes, which were efficiently differentiated
from Fabry-iPS cells, might be useful in
mechanistic and therapeutic studies (Meng et al., 2010).
CONCLUSIONS
On the neurophysiological and neuropathological
investigations, Fabry neuropathy is characterized as a

length-dependent peripheral neuropathy affecting
mainly the small myelinated (Ad) fibers and unmyelinated
(C) fibers.
ERT has been shown to have a positive effect on renal
and cardiac function especially in the early stage, gastrointestinal
disturbance, neuropathic pain, the detection
threshold for thermal sensation, and sweat function.
On the contrary, evidence of a favorable impact of
ERT on the central nervous system has not been established.
ERT should be initiated early before the appearance
of irreversible organ failure and other therapeutic
strategies are necessary.
Female heterozygotes should be carefully and regularly
monitored for signs and symptoms and considered
for ERT for the reason that they are not just carriers
of Fabry disease but can also develop a range of the
symptoms.
