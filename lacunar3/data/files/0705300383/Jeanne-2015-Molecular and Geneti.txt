Strokes cause a death every 4 minutes in the United States, 
representing the fourth leading cause of death and a major 
cause of long-term disability.1 Intracerebral hemorrhages 
(ICHs) are the most fatal form of stroke.2 Lack of effective 
treatment options and poor clinical outcomes for ICH patients 
suggest that prevention is paramount for reducing the tremendous
personal and societal burden. Development of preventive 
strategies relies on understanding environmental and genetic 
factors that contribute to ICH risk. Mutations in the genes 
encoding collagen type IV alpha1 (COL4A1) and alpha2
(COL4A2) cause highly penetrant cerebrovascular disease 
with variable expressivity.3 COL4A1 mutations are a significant
cause of porencephaly4 and pediatric ICH, which are 
associated with particularly poor outcomes, including cerebral
palsy, intellectual disabilities, developmental and behavioral
disorders, and epilepsy. COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations 
also cause spontaneous ICHs in adults.5,6 Thus, COL4A1 and 
COL4A2 mutations are important causes of highly penetrant 
perinatal ICH and may play a substantial role in age-related 
cerebrovascular diseases.
Clinical Perspective on p 1565
COL4A1 and COL4A2 are extracellular matrix molecules 
that form a network integral to basement membranes.7,8 They 
are cotranslationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum
, where they assemble into heterotrimers composed of 
1 COL4A2 and 2 COL4A1 molecules.9 Each protein has a 
large triple-helical domain flanked by the 7S10 and noncollagenous
(NC1) domains at the amino and carboxy terminus, 
respectively.11 The globular NC1 domains are responsible for 
initiating heterotrimer assembly, which proceeds by the progressive
interwinding of the triple-helical domains.12,13 Triplehelical
domains are characterized by repeated Gly-Xaa-Yaa 
motifs (Xaa and Yaa represent variable amino acids) and form 
>80% of the proteins. As in other collagens,14,15 glycine missense
mutations are the most common type of mutation,16
and in vitro, the primary consequence appears to be impaired 
heterotrimer biosynthesis.5,17,18 How this may contribute to 
ICH in vivo remains unknown. Pathogenesis could involve 
toxic intracellular heterotrimer accumulation, extracellular 
deficiency of normal collagen, or the extracellular presence 
of mutant collagen.19 Our objectives were to identify the 
molecular and cellular events that occur in the neurovascular 
unit leading to ICH in Col4a1 mutant mice and to identify 
Background—Collagen type IV alpha1 (COL4A1) and alpha2 (COL4A2) form heterotrimers critical for vascular basement 
membrane stability and function. Patients with COL4A1 or COL4A2 mutations suffer from diverse cerebrovascular 
diseases, including cerebral microbleeds, porencephaly, and fatal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the 
pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown, and there is a lack of effective treatment.
Methods and Results—Using Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutant mouse models, we investigated the genetic complexity and 
cellular mechanisms underlying the disease. We found that Col4a1 mutations cause abnormal vascular development, 
which triggers small-vessel disease, recurrent hemorrhagic strokes, and age-related macroangiopathy. We showed that 
allelic heterogeneity, genetic context, and environmental factors such as intense exercise or anticoagulant medication 
modulated disease severity and contributed to phenotypic heterogeneity. We found that intracellular accumulation of 
mutant collagen in vascular endothelial cells and pericytes was a key triggering factor of ICH. Finally, we showed that 
treatment of mutant mice with a US Food and Drug Administration–approved chemical chaperone resulted in a decreased 
collagen intracellular accumulation and a significant reduction in ICH severity.
Conclusions—Our data are the first to show therapeutic prevention in vivo of ICH resulting from Col4a1 mutation and 
imply that a mechanism-based therapy promoting protein folding might also prevent ICH in patients with COL4A1 and 
COL4A2 mutations. (Circulation. 2015;131:1555-1565. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013395.)

preventive therapeutics that target these events. We investigated
the timing and location of the pathogenesis and potential 
roles of intracellular and extracellular insults using multiple 
mouse models. Importantly, we identified modifiable ICH 
risk factors and a pharmacological intervention that reduced 
ICH in vivo. These data provide proof of principle for mechanism-based
interventions to reduce, delay, or prevent ICH in 
patients with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations.
Methods
Animals
Procedures were in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee guidelines. Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutant mice were 
described previously.18,20 Each strain was iteratively crossed to 
C57BL/6J (B6) mice for at least 5 generations. CAST/EiJ (CAST) 
and 129S6/SvEvTac (129) breeders were mated with B6 mice to produce
CASTB6F1 and 129B6F1 mice, respectively. The Col4a1Flex41
conditional mutant mouse was produced by InGenious Targeting 
Laboratory (Stony Brook, NY). Rosa26-CreER mice21 were used for 
ubiquitous inducible CRE expression. Tie2-Cre,22 Pdgfrb-Cre,23 and 
Gfap-Cre24 were used for cell-type specific CRE expression. We used 
ROSA26tm14(CAG-tdTomato) reporter mice25 to validate CRE-
mediated recombination. Unless specified, all mutant mice were heterozygous
, and both sexes were used.
In Vivo Procedures
CRE was activated with tamoxifen (10 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO). Pregnant females received 1 intraperitoneal tamoxifen 
injection (2 mg) mixed with progesterone (1 mg; Sigma-Aldrich). 
Pups received 1 intragastric tamoxifen injection (50 μg) for 3 consecutive
days, and 3-week-old mice received 1 intraperitoneal tamoxifen 
injection (2 mg) for 2 consecutive days.
Virgin 3-month-old females were exercised on a horizontal treadmill
(Exer 3/6, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) for 5 sessions.
Each session included a 2-minute acclimation period (speed, 
0 m/min), 8-minute warmup (3 minutes at 6 m/min, 3 minutes at 9 
m/min, 2 minutes at 12 m/min), and five 1-minute sprints (1 minute 
at 15 m/min followed by 1 minute rest at 0 m/min). Sessions were 
performed 5 days apart, and animals were euthanized 12 days after 
the last session.
Mice received Warfarin (warfarin sodium tablets, Amneal 
Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) via drinking water at the estimated
dose of 0.4 mg/kg per day (2.5 mg dissolved in 800 mL water) 
for 4 days, water without warfarin for 2 days, and then water with 
warfarin for 3 days. Because 2 mutant mice died, treatment was discontinued
, and the remaining animals were euthanized 11 days later.
Mice received sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA; Enzo Life Sciences 
Inc, Farmingdale, NY) diluted in PBS by injection. Pups received 
intragastric injection of 0.1 mg 4PBA at postnatal day (P) 1, P3, P5, 
and P7; then intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg 4PBA at P10, P12, 
P14, P16, P18, and P20; and finally intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 mg 
4PBA at P23 and P26. Mice were euthanized at 1 month of age.
Retinal fluorescein angiography was performed with a Micron III 
(Phoenix Research Labs Inc, Pleasanton, CA). One-month-old mice 
were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg)-xylazine (10 mg/kg) 
and received an intraperitoneal 20-μL fluorescein sodium injection 
(25 mg/mL in PBS; Altaire Pharmaceuticals Inc, Riverhead, NY).
Histology and Immunofluorescence Labeling
Anesthetized mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 16 hours, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS, and 
embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, 
CA). For ICH quantification, coronal cryosections (35 μm) regularly 
spaced along the raustro-codal axis were stained with Prussian Blue/
Fast red. Images were acquired with a SteREO Discovery.V8 microscope
, an AxioCam ICc3 camera, and AxioVision 4.6 software (Carl 
Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Germany). On each section, the percentage
of brain area with Prussian Blue staining was calculated with 
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Hemorrhage severity 
was expressed as the average percentage of hemosiderin surface area 
on 27 sections for each brain. Trichrome staining was performed on 
5-μm paraffin sections according to the manufacturer’s protocol (One 
Step Trichrome Blue/Red Stain Kit, American Mastertech Scientific 
Inc, Lodi, CA).
For the investigation of blood-brain barrier integrity, 10 mL biotin 
(EZ-link sulfo-NHS-Biotin, 0.5 mg/mL in PBS; Thermo Scientific, 
Waltham, MA) was transcardially perfused after washing with saline and 
before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Coronal cryosections were 
fixed 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with streptavidin 
Alexa Fluor 488 (2 pg/μL; Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). 
Alternatively, a 2% Evans Blue solution in saline (4 mL/kg) was injected 
intraperitoneally and allowed to circulate for 24 hours.
Embryos were fixed for 1 hour in cold methanol, cryoprotected 
in 30% sucrose/PBS, and cryosectioned (20 μm). For embryonic 
angiogenesis, hindbrains were fixed for 1 hour in 4% paraformaldehyde
before flat mounting. For retinal analysis, enucleated eyes were 
fixed for 16 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde, and dissected retinas 
were flat mounted. Cultured primary fibroblasts were fixed for 15 
minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS/0.1% 
Triton X-100 before immunolabeling. Cryosections were postfixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes before immunolabeling. All 
specimens were blocked in PBS with 10% normal donkey serum, 
1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies—rat CD31 
(1:200; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), goat type IV collagen (1:200; 
Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), rat COL4A1 (1:100, H11 
clone; Shigei Medical Research Institute, Okayama, Japan26), rabbit
ZO-1 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit Claudin5 (1:100; 
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and mouse HSP47 (1:500, M16.10A1 
clone; Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA)—were incubated 
for 3 hours at room temperature for cryosections or for 48 hours 
at 4°C for flat mounts. After 3 washes in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, 
secondary antibodies—Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:500 dilution; 
Invitrogen-Molecular Probes)—were incubated for 1 hour for sections
or 24 hours for flat mounts. After 3 washes, coverslips were 
mounted with Mowiol with DAPI (2 μg/mL). A Zeiss AxioImager 
M.1 and a Zeiss LSM700 with plan-Apochromat objectives (63×/1.4 
oil immersion or 20×/0.8) were used for fluorescence microscopy, 
with an AxioCam MRm camera and AxioVision and ZEN software 
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC). Embryonic vascular plexus density 
quantifications were performed with ImageJ. Vein branch point quantifications
were realized by averaging the number of at least 3 primary 
veins per retina.
Western Blot Analysis
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.2 
mmol/L penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO
2
. At confluence, 
cells were serum deprived and treated with 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid 
for 16 hours. Proteins were separated on 4% to 15% gradient SDSPAGE
gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA). Membranes 
were blocked for 16 hours in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20 
with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated for 16 hours with the following
primary antibodies: rat COL4A1 (1:200, H11 clone; Shigei 
Medical Research Institute26), tubulin (1:10000, T6557; Sigma-
Aldrich), and laminin (1+2; 1:2000, ab7463; Abcam). After 3 washes 
in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated 
for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:10000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). After 3 
washes, SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo 
Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
Normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 
Shapiro-Wilk tests. Two-group comparisons were carried out with 
the Student t test. Multiple-group comparisons were performed 
with ANOVA followed by the Tukey posttest or Kruskal-Wallis

Results
Pathogenesis Occurs in Distinct Stages
Col4a1∆ex41 is a splice-site mutation that skips exon 41 in the 
triple-helical domain of murine Col4a1.3,17,27 Col4a1∆ex41/∆ex41
mice die during embryogenesis, and Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice exhibit 
embryonic growth retardation and reduced postnatal viability
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Modeling 
patients with COL4A1 mutations, surviving Col4a1+/∆ex41
mice have multisystem disorders, including fully penetrant 
cerebrovascular disease presenting as porencephaly and 
prenatal, perinatal, and recurrent multifocal ICHs.17,27 At 
embryonic day (E) 10.5, we observed irregularly shaped and 
enlarged blood vessels, as well as multifocal intraparenchymal
and intraventricular hemorrhages (Figure 1A). Analysis 
of cerebral angiogenesis at E12.5 revealed increased vessel 
density and tortuosity in Col4a1+/∆ex41 hindbrains (Figure 1B). 
Mature retinal vasculature showed similar defects, including 
persistent hyaloid vessels and abnormal crossing of excessively
branched, tortuous arteries, and veins with irregular 
diameters (Figure 1C). We also detected tortuous cerebral 
arteries, veins, and capillaries in adult Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice 
(Figure 1D). Cerebral and retinal vessels were not permeable
to biotin, Evans Blue dye, or sodium fluorescein, and 
tight junction proteins were normally expressed during brain 
development, indicating that the blood-brain and blood-retinal
barriers are intact (Figure 1D and Figure II in the onlineonly
Data Supplement).
At birth, Col4a1+/∆ex41 pups had numerous macroscopic 
subcutaneous hematomas, extra-axial hemorrhages, and 
frequent intraparenchymal hemorrhages (Figure IC in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Consistent with highly penetrant
intraventricular hemorrhages, 80% of Col4a1+/∆ex41
mice had porencephaly (Figure 2A). ICH was completely 
penetrant; however, the location and character of the lesions 
changed with time, suggesting different stages of pathology.
At 1 month, Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice had small-vessel disease
, with multiple small hemosiderin deposits throughout 
the cortex, cerebral nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellum. By 
3 months, these were cleared, but fewer and larger hemorrhages
appeared in the basal ganglia. Reduced hemoglobin 
level and age-dependent hemosiderin accumulation indicated 
recurring ICHs (Figure 2A and Figure III in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Importantly, cerebral macroangiopathy 
with fibrotic vessel wall thickening and thrombus formation 
appeared with age (Figure 2B).
Figure 1. Col4a1 mutation causes abnormal cerebral and retinal vascular development. A, At embryonic day (E) 10.5, Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice have 
irregularly shaped, enlarged blood vessels (calculated in branchial arches using CD31 and collagen type IV [COL4] labeling; scale bar, 100 μm) 
and intracerebral hemorrhages (arrow). B, At E12.5, Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice have abnormally tortuous vessels with increased density (calculated in 
hindbrain flat mounts with CD31 labeling; scale bar, 100 μm). C, In mutant animals, retinal blood vessels are tortuous, arteries (A) and veins (V) 
cross each other, and there is excess branching in the main veins (5≤n≤16, pair-wise comparisons per age; scale bar, 500 μm). D, Intracardiac 
perfusion of biotin revealed that adult mutant animals have tortuous cerebral blood vessels without a compromised blood-brain barrier (scale 
bar, 100 μm). Data are reported as mean+SD. *P<0.05 vs Col4a1+/+ by the Student t test.

Age-Related ICH and Macroangiopathy Are 
Consequences of Developmental Defects
To distinguish between potentially distinct roles for COL4A1 
in cerebrovascular development and maintenance, we engineered
a conditional Col4a1 mutation by flanking exon 41 with 
LoxP sites (Col4a1Flex41). This allele recreates the Col4a1∆ex41
mutation in a CRE-dependent manner (Figure IV in the onlineonly
Data Supplement). We crossed Col4a1+/Flex41 mice to 
the inducible, ubiquitous CRE strain R26-CreER 21; injected 
tamoxifen at birth, 1 week, or 3 weeks; validated CRE activation
; and quantified retinal branching and ICHs (Figure 3 and 
Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement). In 8-month-old 
R26-CreER; Col4a1+/Flex41 mice, ICHs were more severe in mice 
that started to express mutant collagen at birth than at 1 week 
and were absent in mice that started to express mutant collagen
at 3 weeks. Pathology in neither group was as severe as in 
Col4a1+/∆ex41, and none of the mice had porencephaly or macroangiopathy.
These data demonstrate that age-related, recurrent
ICHs and macroangiopathy do not occur in the absence 
of prenatal and postnatal developmental defects. To refine the 
timing of pathogenesis, we induced the Col4a1 mutation at 
E10.5 or E14.5 and quantified ICHs at 1 month. ICHs were 
more severe in mice induced at E10.5 than at E14.5. Again, 
neither group was as severe as Col4a1+/∆ex41; however, controls 
revealed reduced recombination efficiency with embryonic 
induction of mutant Col4a1 (Figure V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Together, these data demonstrate that the effects 
of mutant COL4A1 require expression during embryogenesis 
and the early postnatal period to cause progressive, recurrent 
ICHs and age-related macroangiopathy.
ICH Modulation by Environmental and Genetic 
Factors
We sought ways to reduce the severity of progressive ICH. 
In the previous experiment, tamoxifen injection during pregnancy
compromised natural birth and necessitated surgical 
delivery. A beneficial effect of surgical delivery was previously
proposed but not quantified.27 We found that tamoxifentreated
, surgically delivered Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice had less ICHs 
than nontreated, naturally born Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice (Figure 4A). 
Next, we quantified the impacts of other modifiable risk factors
that have been anecdotally associated with ICH in patients 
with COL4A1 or COL4A2 mutations, including physical 
exertion28–30 and anticoagulant administration.5,6,27,31 We found 
that exercise increased ICH severity (Figure 4B) and anticoagulants
provoked fatal hemorrhages within just 7 days of use 
(Figure 4C). Together, these data establish vaginal delivery, 
exercise, and anticoagulants as modifiable risk factors that 
increase ICH severity in Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice.
Genetic factors may also influence clinical heterogeneity
among patients with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations32,33
and can reveal pathogenic mechanisms and interventional 
Figure 2. Col4a1 mutation causes small-vessel disease, hemorrhagic stroke, and macroangiopathy. A, Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice have 
porencephaly (penetrance, 80%) and intracerebral hemorrhages (penetrance, 100%) quantified with Prussian Blue staining of serial 
coronal brain sections (scale bar, 1 mm). Data are reported as mean±SD. B, Macroangiopathy with vessel wall thickening, fibrosis, and 
thrombosis advanced with age. Trichrome staining shows collagen deposition (blue) and fibrin accumulation (red) in affected blood 
vessels (scale bar, 100 μm). No Col4a1+/+ mice had porencephaly, intracerebral hemorrhage, or macroangiopathy (n=32). by guest on January 10, 2017 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from

approaches. We compared ICH severity in mice with different 
mutations on the same genetic background and in mice with the 
same mutation on different genetic backgrounds. The allelic 
series comprised Col4a1∆ex41, 7 glycine mutations in the triplehelical
domain (6 in COL4A1, 1 in COL4A2) and 1 mutation 
in the COL4A1 NC1 domain (Figure 5A).18,20 We backcrossed 
each strain to C57BL/6J (B6) mice, aged the cohorts for 7.5 
to 9.5 months (called the 8-month cohort), and compared 
porencephaly, ICH, and macroangiopathy. We identified distinct
classes of mutations and 3 potential genotype-phenotype 
correlations (Figure 5A and Figure VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement). First, there appears to be a class effect whereby 
Col4a1∆ex41 is more severe than missense mutations. Second is 
a domain effect whereby the NC1 domain mutation is milder 
than the triple-helical domain mutations. Third, for mutations 
within the triple-helical domain, there was a position effect 
whereby mutations closer to the carboxy terminus were more 
severe than mutations closer to the amino terminus. These data 
establish the powerful effects of allelic heterogeneity on ICH 
severity and suggest that there are class, domain, and position
effects of different alleles that resemble effects observed 
in other types of collagens.19,34–36 Next, we tested the effect of

genetic context on ICH severity. We crossed B6 Col4a1+/∆ex41
mice to CAST/EiJ (CAST) or 129S6/SvEvTac (129) mice 
to generate CASTB6F1 or 129B6F1 mice, respectively. We 
compared ICH severity among Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice and found 
that CASTB6F1 genetic context significantly suppressed ICH 
but 129B6F1 did not (Figure 5B). CASTB6F1 also reduced 
porencephaly penetrance and delayed macroangiopathy onset 
(Figure VII in the online-only Data Supplement). The effect 
was not allele or gene specific because CASTB6F1 also significantly
suppressed ICH in Col4a1+/G1344D and Col4a2+/G646D mice 
(Figure 5C). Surprisingly, there were neither allelic nor genetic 
context effects on retinal or cerebral blood vessel defects 
(Figure 5D). The observations of allelic and genetic context 
effects on ICH but not on the vascular patterning defects suggest
that processes in addition to defective angiogenesis and 
vascular patterning may be required for ICH progression.
Figure 5. Allelic heterogeneity and genetic context contribute to the expressivity of Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutations. A, Intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) quantification in 8-month-old mice with different mutations but the same genetic background, C57BL/6J (B6), 
demonstrates that allelic heterogeneity influences ICH severity. *P<0.05 by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn posttest. B, ICH 
quantification in 8-month-old mice with the same Col4a1∆ex41 mutation but different genetic contexts shows that genetic background 
influences ICH severity. A cross for 1 generation to CAST/EiJ (CAST) but not 129S6/SvEvTac (129) mice was sufficient to reduce ICH 
severity compared with Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice on a B6 background. *P<0.05 by ANOVA followed by Tukey posttest. C, CAST suppression of 
ICH was consistent across different mutations but (D) did not extend to prevention of vascular tortuosity and excess branching (collagen 
type IV [COL4] labeling in the retina, CD31 labeling in the brain; scale bars, 50 μm). In C and D, n.s. indicates P>0.05; **P<0.01 by the 
Student t test. Data are reported as mean±SD (A–C) or mean+SD (D). WT indicates wild-type.

Pathogenic Collagen Accumulation in Vascular 
Endothelial Cells and Pericytes
Heterotrimers that incorporate mutant COL4A1 or COL4A2 
tend to accumulate within cells at the expense of secretion. 
Because ICH severity correlates with intracellular accumulation
in the allelic series,18 we hypothesized that CASTB6F1 
suppression of ICH might occur by reducing intracellular
COL4A1. We compared intracellular and extracellular 
COL4A1 in primary fibroblasts and found that Col4a1+/∆ex41
caused significantly increased intracellular COL4A1 in B6 but 
not CASTB6F1 cells (Figure 6A). Moreover, the CASTB6F1 
background normalized intracellular without increasing extracellular
COL4A1 levels, a distinction that was also striking 
in vivo. Blood vessels from B6 Col4a1+/∆ex41 animals had 
punctuate intracellular COL4 labeling and less intense labeling
of the vascular basement membrane than Col4a1+/+ mice. 
CASTB6F1 Col4a1+/∆ex41 vessels do not show intracellular 
labeling yet still lacked intense labeling of the basement membrane
(Figure 6B). Thus, mutant mice from both backgrounds 
have reduced extracellular COL4A1, yet only B6 mice 
have significant intracellular accumulation and severe ICH. 
Importantly, these data dissect the potential roles of intracellular
accumulation and extracellular deficiency and suggest 
that chronic intracellular accumulation may cause ICH in the 
context of developmentally abnormal vessels.
To test the relative effects of the different cell types of 
the neurovascular unit, we conditionally expressed mutant 
Col4a1 in vascular endothelial cells (VECs), pericytes, or 
astrocytes using Tie2-Cre,22 Pdgfrb-Cre,23 or Gfap-Cre24 transgenic
mice, respectively (Figure 6C). We validated these lines 
(Figure VIIIA in the online-only Data Supplement) and quantified
ICH at 1 and 8 months. Specific expression of mutant 
Figure 6. Intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) are associated with intracellular COL4A1 accumulation in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) 
and pericytes but not with extracellular deficiency. A, Immunolabeling and Western blot show that intracellular COL4A1 in Col4a1+/∆ex41
cells from B6 mice is greatly reduced in cells from CASTB6F1 mice but without an obvious increase in extracellular COL4A1. Laminin and 
tubulin are controls for secreted and intracellular proteins, respectively. Results constitute representative examples from 12 independent 
biological replicates obtained from 3 independent experiments. C indicates cell lysate; and M, conditioned medium. B, Immunolabeling 
of Col4a1+/∆ex41 retinal vessels shows strong intracellular collagen type IV (COL4) in B6 but not CASTB6F1 mice. C, Col4a1+/Flex41 mice 
were crossed to Tie2-Cre, Pdgfrb-Cre, or Gfap-Cre strains for mutant Col4a1 conditional expression in VECs, pericytes, or astrocytes, 
respectively. D, Retinal vessel quantification revealed excess branching with mutant expression in VECs and pericytes but not astrocytes. 
n.s. indicates P>0.05; *P<0.05 vs Flex41-only mice (Col4a1+/Flex41;Cre−/−) by Student t test. E, ICH quantification demonstrated that mutant 
Col4a1 expression in VECs or pericytes is sufficient to cause ICH but that neither cell type alone phenocopies Col4a1+/∆ex41. Conditional 
expression of mutant Col4a1 in astrocytes caused very mild ICHs in only three 8-month-old animals. *P<0.05 by Kruskal-Wallis test

Col4a1 only in astrocytes did not overall significantly affect 
retinal branching and gave very mild ICHs in only 3 of 8 old 
animals (Figure 6D and 6E). Expression in VECs-only or pericytes-only
was sufficient to phenocopy excess retinal vascular 
branching of Col4a1+/∆ex41 (Figure 6D) and caused fully penetrant
ICH (Figure 6E) and incompletely penetrant porencephaly
and macroangiopathy (Figure VIIIB in the online-only Data 
Supplement). However neither strain demonstrated ICH as 
severe as that in Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice. Interestingly, when we tested 
E16.5 embryos, ICH was greater in Tie2-Cre;Col4a1+/Flex41
compared to Pdgfrb-Cre;Col4a1+/Flex41 mice, and the postnatal
viability of Tie2-Cre;Col4a1+/Flex41 mice was much lower 
(27% compared with 100% for Pdgfrb-Cre;Col4a1+/Flex41 mice; 
Figure IVD in the online-only Data Supplement). Therefore, 
the most severely affected Tie2-Cre;Col4a1+/Flex41 mice may be 
underrepresented in postnatal analyses, leading to an underestimate
of the relative role of VECs in the pathogenesis. These 
data suggest that both VECs and pericytes contribute to vascular
defects and that VECs may play a relatively larger role.
The results from CASTB6F1 mice suggest that reducing
intracellular accumulation may suppress ICH, and 
results from the inducible mutation indicate that postnatal 
intervention may be effective. 4PBA, a US Food and Drug 
Administration–approved chemical chaperone, has been used 
in several models of disorders caused by protein misfolding,37
and we recently showed that its properties extend to COL4A1 
in vitro.18 To test our hypothesis in vivo, we treated pups with 
4PBA from birth to weaning age and analyzed retinal vasculature
and ICH at 1 month. Treatment had no effect on vessel 
branching; however, there was decreased intracellular accumulation
and qualitatively more uniform labeling of vascular 
basement membranes. Importantly, compared with untreated 
Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice, mutant animals treated with 4PBA had 
significantly less severe ICH (Figure 7). These data are the 
first to show therapeutic prevention of Col4a1-related ICH 
in vivo and support the hypothesis that promoting protein 
folding might also prevent ICH in patients with COL4A1 and 
COL4A2 mutations.
Discussion
Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutant mice model important aspects 
of human disease. Embryonic germinal matrix hemorrhages 
cause porencephaly, and early small-vessel disease presents 
as microbleeds throughout the brain. Later, recurrent ICHs 
and age-related macroangiopathy occur mainly in the basal 
ganglia. Importantly, our data bring new insights into the disease
biology and suggest that 2 pathogenic mechanisms are 
necessary to cause ICH. First, we showed that Col4a1 and 
Col4a2 mutations cause abnormal angiogenesis. The fact that 
mice that start to express mutant collagen after the completion
of vascular development do not suffer from ICH suggests 
that abnormal angiogenesis is required to trigger hemorrhage. 
Second, we showed that Col4a1 mutation causes increased 
intracellular and decreased extracellular collagen. The fact that 
ICH severity is associated with the level of intracellular accumulation
but not with extracellular deficiency (Figures 5B, 
6A, and 6B) suggests that the intracellular accumulation is a 
key molecular mechanism in the progression to vasculature 
rupture. A similar observation was reported in human cells 
cultured from an ICH patient with a COL4A2 mutation and his 
unaffected father who also carried the mutation.38 The fact that 
the blood-brain barrier of the abnormally developed vessels 
is generally not compromised also supports this hypothesis, 
suggesting that chronic intracellular accumulation could reach 
locally toxic thresholds and provoke focal ICH. Interestingly, 
we show that abnormal angiogenesis is independent of the 
level of intracellular collagen accumulation, suggesting that 
extracellular insults might underlie abnormal vascular development.
To support this hypothesis, it would be interesting 
to investigate the COL4A1/COL4A2 network in the vascular 
basement membrane. Indeed, this network has been shown 
to interact directly with several signaling pathways involved 
in angiogenesis such as transforming growth factor-β/brain 
Figure 7. Treatment with chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) reduces intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) severity in vivo. 
Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice treated from birth to 3 weeks with 4PBA had similar levels of retinal vessel branching (A) but less severe ICHs  
(B) compared with untreated Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice. Immunolabeled vessels showed less intracellular and more extracellular collagen type IV 
(COL4) in the treated Col4a1+/∆ex41 mouse with the least, compared with greatest, ICH severity. Scale bars, 50 μm. Data are reported as 
mean+SD (A) or mean±SD (B). n.s. indicates P>0.05 by Student t test.

Jeanne et al Hemorrhagic Stroke Caused by Collagen IV Mutations 1563
morphogenetic protein signaling,39,40 Notch signaling,41 and 
integrin signaling,42 and arresten, a proteolytic fragment of 
COL4A1, has antiangiogenic properties.43 Although further
understanding the roles of COL4A1 and COL4A2 in 
angiogenesis is compelling, developmental defects remain 
challenging to target therapeutically. Thus, we showed that 
targeting intracellular collagen accumulation with 4PBA, 
even after birth, successfully decreases ICH severity in vivo. 
These data support that mechanism-based treatments such as 
chemical chaperones might also prevent ICH in patients with 
COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations.
We investigated a clinically relevant series of Col4a1 and 
Col4a2 mutations and discovered important allelic effects that 
resemble those identified for other type of collagens.19,34–36 These 
data have implications for patient screening and for functionally
validating mutations that are identified by genetic testing. 
We show that mutation class, domain, and position all influence 
ICH severity and correlate with intracellular accumulation of 
heterotrimers.18 Mutations that are near the amino terminus 
of the triple-helical domain may cause only mild intracellular
collagen accumulation and therefore may be overlooked 
by functional assays that measure relative levels of intracellular
collagen, resulting in false negatives (eg, Col4a1+/G394V).18
Therefore, position effects should be considered when functionally
testing putative mutations, and the incidence of 
COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations may be higher than current 
estimates. Interestingly, despite differences in stoichiometric
contributions to heterotrimer composition, positionally 
matched mutations in Col4a1 and Col4a2 caused similar ICH 
severity, which underscores the importance of analyzing both 
genes when genetically screening patients.
Importantly, our data suggest that the mechanism by which 
COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations cause ICH might be specific 
to this phenotype, which may have important implications for 
patient prognosis and treatment. First, 129B6F1 genetic context
modified ocular dysgenesis32 but not ICH. Second, in the 
allelic series, ICH severity correlates with levels of intracellular
accumulation, whereas myopathy does not.18 This is illustrated
by Col4a1G394V, which is among the mutations causing 
the most severe myopathy but the least severe ICH. HANAC 
(hereditary angiopathy, nephropathy, aneurysms, and cramps) 
describes a subset of patients with myopathy and relatively 
mild cerebrovascular disease whose mutations cluster near 
integrin-binding domains in the amino-terminal quarter of 
COL4A1. Our data (Figure 5A and the work by Kuo et al18) 
suggest a molecular explanation for HANAC whereby mutations
in or near integrin-binding domains lead to myopathy, 
and because these domains are near the amino terminus, the 
mutations cause only mild intracellular collagen accumulation
and relatively mild ICH. Mechanistic heterogeneity has 
important implications for targeted therapies and patient 
treatment. These results suggest that pharmacological interventions
that prevent ICH might not be efficacious for other 
phenotypes and that comprehensive patient treatment might 
require distinct approaches for distinct pathologies.
We have identified vaginal delivery, intense exercise, and 
anticoagulant use as modifiable environmental risk factors that 
exacerbate ICH severity in Col4a1+/∆ex41 mice. Anticoagulation 
is a highly effective treatment for the prevention of 
thromboembolic stroke. However, our results and reports of 
patients with COL4A1 or COL4A2 mutations suffering from 
hemorrhagic stroke while taking anticoagulant medication 
suggest that the risks of antithrombotic therapy may be judged 
to outweigh its benefits.5,6,27,31 These decisions will need to be 
measured against the increased risk for ICH. Similarly, Col4a1
mutations are not associated with hypertension27,44; however, 
intense exercise in mice induced ICH and has been associated 
with hemorrhagic events in patients.28–30 These data are important
for patients with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations who 
are considering the beneficial or detrimental consequences of 
physical exercise. Although cesarean delivery will not reduce 
or prevent embryonic ICH or porencephaly, our data demonstrate
that cesarean delivery of genetically at-risk individuals 
may reduce perinatal ICH. Because of the exacerbating effects 
of intense exercise, cesarean delivery may also be warranted 
when the mother carries the mutation.
Conclusions
We used an allelic series, genetic modification, and a conditionally
expressed Col4a1 mutation to distinguish the 
relative impacts of intracellular accumulation from extracellular
COL4A1 deficiency, to dissect cell type–specific contributions
, and to define a window for potential therapeutic 
intervention. Our data suggest that intracellular collagen accumulation
is responsible for ICH progression. Thus, promoting 
either heterotrimer degradation or secretion may be a viable 
approach to reduce ICH severity. Importantly, we show that 
4PBA, a readily available small molecule with chaperone 
properties, reduced ICH severity in vivo. Together, these findings
demonstrate the efficacy of controlling modifiable environmental
risk factors and application of a mechanism-based 
therapy to prevent ICH caused by COL4A1 mutations.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Despite intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) being the most fatal form of stroke, there is a lack of effective treatment options, and 
only a few genetic causes have been identified. Mutations in the collagen type IV alpha1 (COL4A1) and alpha2 (COL4A2) 
genes cause highly penetrant cerebrovascular disease, including porencephaly, perinatal ICHs, small-vessel disease, and 
recurrent spontaneous ICHs in adults. Using Col4a1 mutant mice modeling human disease, we showed that the pathogenesis 
occurs in different phases, with age-related ICHs and macroangiopathy being consequences of abnormal vascular development.
Our data suggest that toxic intracellular collagen accumulation in the abnormal vasculature is a key pathogenic 
event that leads to ICH progression. Using sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, a US Food and Drug Administration–approved drug 
with chemical chaperone properties, we showed that targeting this event in our mouse model, even after birth, successfully 
decreases ICH severity in vivo. We also discovered important allelic effects, with mutation class, domain, and position all 
influencing ICH severity. We recommend considering them when functionally testing putative mutations identified in ICH 
patients because mutations near the amino terminus may cause only mild intracellular collagen accumulation, resulting in 
false negatives. Showing that position-matched mutations in Col4a1 and Col4a2 caused similar ICH severity, our results also 
stress the importance of analyzing both genes when genetically screening patients. Finally, we found that vaginal delivery, 
intense exercise, and anticoagulant use exacerbate ICH severity. We propose that controlling these modifiable environmental 
risk factors and targeting intracellular collagen accumulation are viable approaches for stroke prevention in patients with 
COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations.

 causes embryonic growth retardation, reduced viability and 
multifocal hemorrhages (A) Growth retardation is observed in Col4a1
+/Δex41
 mutants as early as embryonic 
day  (E) 9.5 and is more pronounced in homozygous Col4a1
Δex41/Δex41
 mutants, which do not survive after 
mid-gestation. (B) In backcross matings, mutant embryos are represented at expected ratios of 1:1 until birth 
when Col4a1

Supplemental  Figure  2:  Blood-brain-barrier  and  blood-retina-barrier  are  not  compromised  in 
Col4a1
+/Δex41
 animals (A) As a positive control for the experiment presented in Figure 1 (D), we show that 
biotin diffuses from the blood vessel into the liver (bottom) whereas it stays inside the cerebral vasculature 
(top)  because  of  the  presence  of  the  blood-brain-barrier  in  a Col4a1
+/+
 mouse (B) In Col4a1
+/Δex41
 mice, 
intracardiac perfusion of biotin revealed that the blood-brain-barrier is intact (unaffected blood vessel) until 
the  vasculature  ruptures,  leading  to  hemorrhage  and  leakage  of  biotin  in  the  surrounding parenchyma 
(hemorrhagic blood vessel) (C) Intra-peritoneal injection of sodium fluorescein reveals no general leakage of 
the Col4a1
+/Δex41
 blood-retina-barrier on ocular fundus examination. (D) Blood-brain-barrier proteins such as 
zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and Claudin 5 (CLDN5) (labeled in green) are expressed in Col4a1
+/Δex41
cerebral blood vessels (labeled with CD31, red) as early as E14.5.

Supplemental Figure 4: The Col4a1
Flex41
 conditional mutant allele in presence of active CRE recombinase mimics 
the Col4a1
Δex41
 mutation (A)  The Col4a1
Flex41
 conditional mutant allele has exon 41 flanked by LoxP sites. In the 
presence of active CRE recombinase, exon 41 is removed, mimicking pathogenic effects of the Col4a1
Δex41
 mutation 
such as (B) intracellular accumulation of collagen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (MEFs: primary mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts, HSP47: ER marker). (C) Compared to littermate controls that did not have hemorrhage, double heterozygous 
Col4a1

; Tie2-Cre
CRE/–
 (endothelial-specific expression of CRE) P0 pups showed perinatal multi–focal intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH). cDNA from whole brain amplified with primers in Col4a1 exons 40 and 42 detected expression of 
transcripts  missing  exon  41  (51  nucleotides)  in Col4a1
+/Flex41
 mice when CRE is present (lower band). ( D)  Average 
number of ICHs per brain section in E16.5 embryos. Col4a1

ubiquitously have as many ICH as Col4a1
+/Δex41
 embryos. The survival rate at weaning age is indicated (%). Data are 
reported as mean ± standard deviation.

Supplemental Figure 5: Tamoxifen induces ubiquitous CRE activation when injected after birth, but 
only  partial  CRE  activation  when  injected  during  gestation (A)  We  evaluated  the  efficiency  of  CRE 
activation by tamoxifen using the TdTomato reporter mouse strain. Postnatal tamoxifen injection achieved 
ostensibly complete recombination whereas prenatal tamoxifen injection did not (TdTomato in red, CD31 in 
green)  (B)  Quantification  of  retinal  vein  branch  points  showed  excess  branching  when  tamoxifen  was 
delivered  before  or  at  birth  but  not  after  one  week  (when  retinal  vascular  development  is completed) 
confirming  that  tamoxifen  delivery  and  mutant Col4a1 induction was successful (9≤n≤36). n.s.:  p>0.05,  *: 
p<0.05  compared  to  Flex41  only  (Col4a1
+/Flex41
;  R26CreER
-/-
)  mice  by  Student’s t-test.  (C) Intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) quantification of brains from 1-month old mice showed that mutant Col4a1 induction at 
E10.5  or  E14.5  caused  ICH  and  that  earlier  induction  led  to  more  ICH.  Tamoxifen  administration 
compromised  natural  birth  so  all  liters  were  surgically  delivered  (C  sect). The  observation  that  E10.5 
induction did not phenocopy Col4a1
+/Δex41
mice likely reflects the reduced recombination efficiency shown in 
A. Data are reported as mean + (B) or ± (C) standard deviation.
Supplemental Figure 6: Porencephaly and macro-angiopathy in an allelic series of Col4a1 and Col4a2
mutations. We analyzed 27 regularly spaced coronal cryo-sections per brain (n=5-7 mice per genotype) to 
determine the frequencies of porencephaly and macro-angiopathy in mice from the allelic series.

caused  by Col4a1
Δex41
 mutation. The penetrance of porencephaly in Col4a1
+/Δex41
mice was reduced by 
CASTB6F1  but  not  129B6F1 genetic context. CASTB6F1  also  prevents  or  delays  macro-angiopathy  in 
Col4a1
+/Δex41
mice. C57BL/6J (B6), CAST/EiJ (CAST), 129S6/SvEvTac (129) (n: number of animals in each 
cohort).
Supplemental  Figure  8:  Cell  type  specific  expression  of  mutant  COL4A1 (A) Cell type specific CRE 
mouse strains were crossed with a TdTomato reporter strain to show the specificity of the CRE expression: 
in astrocytes, in pericytes and in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) for Gfap-Cre, Pdgfrb-Cre and Tie2-Cre
respectively (CD31 labeled the VECs in green, TdTomato is red in cells expressing the CRE, brain sections 
of embryonic day 12.5 embryos) (B) Porencephaly and macro-angiopathy penetrance were quantified using 
serial coronal brain sections (n: number of animals in each cohort).
