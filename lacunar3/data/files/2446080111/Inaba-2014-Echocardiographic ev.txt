Cardiomyopathy

Background:Small animal models of ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are important for the preclinical
optimization of stem cell therapy. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that temporal changes in LV
function and regional perfusion after cell therapy can be assessed in mice using echocardiographic imaging.
Methods: Wild-type mice (n = 25) were studied 7 and 28 days after permanent ligation of the left anterior
descending coronary artery. Animals were randomized to receive closed-chest ultrasound-guided intramyocardial
delivery of saline (n = 13) or 5105multipotential adult progenitor cells (MAPCs; n= 12) on day 7. LV
end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, LV ejection fraction, and stroke volume were measured using highfrequency
echocardiography. Multiplanar assessments of perfusion and defect area size were made using
myocardial contrast echocardiography.
Results:Between days 7 and 28, MAPC-treated animals had 40% to 50% reductions in defect size (P< .001)
and 20% to 30% increases in total perfusion (P< .01). Perfusion did not change in nontreated controls. Both LV
end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased between days 7 and 28 in both groups, but LV end-systolic
volume increased to a lesser degree in MAPC-treated compared with control mice (+4.2 6 7.9 vs
+19.2622.0mL, P < .05). LV ejection fraction increased in the MAPC-treated mice and decreased in control
mice (+3.064.3% vs5.665.9%,P< .01). There was a significant linear relation between the change in LV
ejection fraction and the change in either defect area size or total perfusion.
Conclusions:High-frequency echocardiography and myocardial contrast echocardiography in murine models
of ischemic LV dysfunction can be used to assess the response to stem cell therapy and to characterize the
relationship among spatial flow, ventricular function, and ventricular remodeling. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr
2014;27:192-9.)

The number of patients in the United States with symptomatic
ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who are not eligible for
surgical or percutaneous revascularization therapy because of comorbidity
or diffuse pattern of disease is growing.1-3 Proangiogenic stem
cell therapy is a potential option for preserving myocardial viability
and reducing debilitating angina and heart failure symptoms.
Proangiogenic effects may also be important in stem cell–mediated
myocardial regeneration.4,5 Although clinical trials with cell therapy
for ischemic LV dysfunction have been completed, there are many
unanswered questions with regard to the most appropriate cell
type(s), route of administration, dose, and even mechanism of
action. Accordingly, methods for the spatial and temporal characterization
of LV function and regional perfusion are important for
preclinical and clinical evaluation of these unsolved issues as well as
defining the relationship between flow and functional recovery with
cell therapy.
Small animal models of ischemic LV dysfunction have been developed
and provide a relatively inexpensive and high-throughput
platform to test new angiogenic or regenerative therapies. We hypothesized
that quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE)
and two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic methods for
evaluating LV function beyond fractional shortening could be used
to assess the impact of stem cell therapy in a murine model of chronic

ischemic LV dysfunction. To test
this hypothesis, mice with
chronic coronary artery occlusion
and moderate to severely
reduced LV systolic function
were treated with intramyocardial
injection of xenogenic multipotential
adult progenitor cells
(MAPCs), which have been
shown to improve LV function
after myocardial infarction and
have also been shown to increase
perfusion in ischemic
muscle through proangiogenic
paracrine effects.6-9
METHODS
Animal Preparation and Murine Model of Ischemic LV
Dysfunction
The study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at
Oregon Health & Science University. Ischemic LV dysfunction was
produced by permanent coronary occlusion in 25 C57Bl/6 mice
(Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) aged 8 to 10 weeks for
echocardiographic and histologic studies and in 4 athymic Crl:CD1-
Foxn1nu mice with spontaneous albinism (Charles River
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) for in vivo optical imaging experiments.
Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (1.0%–
1.5%), intubated, and placed on positive pressure ventilation. A left
lateral thoracotomy was performed using aseptic technique to expose
the anterior myocardial wall, and a suture was placed around the mid
left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The electrocardiogram
was monitored to confirm myocardial injury, evidenced by
ST-segment elevation. The chest wall was then closed with interrupted
sutures, and the endotracheal tube was removed after voluntary
respiration was confirmed. Mice were then recovered, and buprenorphine
hydrochloride (0.2 mg/kg, intramuscular) was administered for
analgesia. Ten nonischemic control C57Bl/6 mice were also studied at
8 to 10 weeks of age. For all subsequent imaging studies, mice were
anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (1.0%–1.5%), and heart rate
ranged from 450 to 530 beats/min. For MCE, a catheter was placed
in a jugular vein for the administration of microbubbles. All follow-up
echocardiographic imaging was completed in <30 min.
Cell Therapy
Rat MAPCs (Athersys, Inc, Cleveland, OH) were isolated and
expanded as previously described and stored in liquid nitrogen until
the day of use.10 These cells are positive for CD29, CD49c, and
CD90 and negative for CD34, CD45, and CD106.10,11 Cell
viability on the day of use was assessed by trypan blue exclusion.
On day 7 after LAD ligation, mice were anesthetized with inhaled
isoflurane. Either MAPCs (5  105 suspended in 20 mL of saline;
n = 12) or saline alone (n = 13) was injected into the anteriorlateral
aspect of the infarct border zone. Intramyocardial injection
was performed percutaneously using a 30-gauge needle and highfrequency
(40-MHz) ultrasound guidance (Vevo 770; VisualSonics,
Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and a three-dimensional micropositioning
system (VisualSonics, Inc). Intramyocardial delivery was
confirmed by distortion of myocardial speckle and acute increase in
wall thickness by real-time imaging during injection (Video 1; available
at www.onlinejase.com). Animals were not studied if there was
evidence of focal pericardial or mediastinal injection, evidenced by
extracardiac fluid accumulation.
Cell Localization and Survival
In vivo optical imaging was performed to assess MAPC location and
survival and function after injection in athymic Crl:CD1-Foxn1numice
(n = 4). For these experiments, MAPCs were stably transfected with
the firefly luciferase gene using a lentivirus vector. The number of cells
injected 7 days after LAD ligation was increased to 1106 to produce
robust luciferase-generated photon activity through the chest
wall. On days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after MAPC injection, mice were anesthetized
with inhaled isoflurane and D-luciferin (150 mg/g, intraperitoneal
) was administered. Optical imaging (IVIS Spectrum; Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) was performed 10 min after luciferin
injection using medium binning. Luciferase activity was expressed as
photons per second per square centimeter.
LV Function by Echocardiography
Echocardiography for LV function was performed in nonischemic control
mice and in postinfarction mice on day 7 after coronary ligation
(before MAPC or saline injection) and on day 28 (21 days after injection
). High-frequency fundamental imaging (Vevo 770) was performed
at 25 to 40 MHz depending on the echocardiographic data
that were acquired. Mice were sedated with inhaled isoflurane
(1.0%–1.5%). Images were obtained in the parasternal long-axis plane
and three equally spaced parasternal short-axis planes 1 mm apart representingthebasal
,midpapillary,andapicallevels.Imageregistrationto
ensure similar imaging planes for days 7 and 28 was based on both
anatomic features (papillary muscles and trabecular features) and distance
from the mitral valve plane. The LV cross-sectional area was
measured at end-diastole and end-systole for each of the short-axis image
acquisitions. LVend-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LVend-systolic
volume (LVESV) were calculated by summation of interpolated shortaxis
area measurements. LVejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated as
(LVEDVLVESV)/LVEDV. Stroke volume wasdetermined using two
methods (1) the difference in LVESVand LVEDVand (2) the product
of left ventricular outflow tract area and time-velocity integral on
pulsed-wave Doppler. For the latter, left ventricular outflow tract
pulsed-wave Doppler was obtained from a high parasternal long-axis
view with heel-toe angulation to provide a similar angle of incidence
between animals and within the range for automated angle correction.
Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Regional myocardial perfusion and spatial extent of perfusion were
assessed using MCE on the same days that LV function was assessed
by two-dimensional echocardiography.12 Lipid-shelled decafluorobutane
microbubbles were prepared by sonication of an aqueous lipid
dispersion of polyoxyethylene-40-stearate and distearoyl phosphatidylcholine
saturated with decafluorobutane gas. Microbubble concentration
was measured by electrozone sensing (Multisizer III; Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed
using a linear-array transducer(15L8)interfaced withanultrasoundsystem
(Sequoia; Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc, Mountain View,
CA). Short-axis images at the same midventricular and apical levels as
for functional images were obtained, the position for which was guided
by14-MHzfundamentalimaging and amicropositioning imagingstage.

amplitude modulation was used to detect the nonlinear fundamental
component of the microbubble signal at a frequency of 7 MHz.
Imaging was performed at a mechanical index of 0.16 and a dynamic
range of 55 dB. Electrocardiographically triggered end-systolic frames
were acquired during continuous intravenous infusion of microbubbles
at 5105min1. Images were acquired for 15 cardiac cycles after a 5-
frame destructive pulse sequence at a mechanical index of 0.97.
Quantification of myocardial perfusion was performed from regions
of interest placed over the entire short-axis area. Time-intensity data

blood volume (images at the completion of the replenishment
sequence) were used to delineate the region devoid of perfusion.14
Interobserver variation of blinded measurements for the region devoid
of perfusion was 764%. The percentage change in nonperfused area
from baseline to follow-up was calculated by averaging data for the
midventricular and apical planes.
Microsphere Validation of Spatial Perfusion Assessment
Microsphereevaluationofregionalperfusiononday28wasperformed
in8 miceundergoingLADligation(n=4 eachfortheMAPC andsham
saline injection groups). After the completion of MCE, 8105fluorescent
microspheres(15mm Dye-Trak;TritonTechnology,Inc,San Diego,
CA) were injected into left ventricle using high-frequency ultrasound
guidance. Several minutes later, hearts were excised, rinsed in
phosphate-buffered saline, and sectioned into 1-mm-thick short-axis
slices. Fluorescent epi-illumination microscopy (20 objective) with
460-nm to 500-nm excitation filters was performed. Digital planimetry
was used to determine the region void of fluorescent microspheres on
both the basal and apical surfaces of each slice, which were averaged
and expressed asa ratio to the total LV short-axis area. Analysis was performed
for the slices for which ventricular geometry matched the
myocardial contrast echocardiographic imaging planes. Interobserver
variation of blinded measurements was 66 2%.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).
All echocardiographic data were normally distributed and are expressed
as mean6 SD unless otherwise stated. Temporal changes
in luciferase data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
and tests for nonlinear trends. Echocardiographic perfusion and function
data were analyzed using paired Student’s t tests (two sided) for
temporal differences within a treatment group and unpaired
Student’sttests for cohort-related differences at the different study intervals
and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons when
comparing the two treatment groups with nonischemic control animals.
Correlations were made using least squares linear regression
analysis. Differences in proportions for risk area size were analyzed
using c2 tests. Differences were considered significant at P < .05.
RESULTS
Intramyocardial Stem Cell Survival
Onultrasound-guidedpercutaneousinjectionofMAPCs,successofintramyocardial
injection of cells into the anterolateral portion of the
infarct was confirmed by mild tissue distortion during injection.
In vivo optical imaging of luciferase-transfected MAPCs indicated
that the cells remained primarily at the site of injection in the myocardium
(Figure 1). There was rapid loss either of cells or of cell function
overthefirstweek,manifestbya500-foldreductioninluciferasesignal.
Myocardial Perfusion
Myocardial perfusion was assessed using MCE in both apical and mid-
LV short-axis locations that encompassed regions with akinesis on day
7 after LAD ligation in all animals. The apical location was midway
between the midventricle and the true apex, which was not imaged
because it was entirely akinetic in all animals and lacked any evidence
of myocardial perfusion. On day 7 (before MAPC injection), the region
that was void of myocardial perfusion was larger for the apical than the
midventricular plane (26615% vs 126 6%, P =.0001;Figure 2A).
There was no difference in baseline defect size on day 7 between the
MAPC-treated and sham-treated postinfarct groups. On day 28
(21 days after injection), there was a significant reduction in perfusion
defect size only for MAPC-treated mice. In these mice, there was a
similar 50% relative reduction in defect size for the apical and midventricularregions.ThemajorityofMAPC-treatedsegmentshadreductions
in perfusion defect size, which was not the case with sham-treated mice
(Figure 2B). Validation of myocardial contrast echocardiographic defect
size by fluorescent microsphere injection was performed in 8 mice on
day 28 and demonstrated good agreement in the spatial extent of the
defect size for the two techniques (Figure 2C).

Quantitative transmural myocardial perfusion for the entire apical
and midventricular short-axis regions on day 7 in mice undergoing
LAD ligation was reduced compared with nonischemic control
mice (Figure 3). On day 7, myocardial perfusion in the apical region
was slightly lower for the MAPC-treated mice, although this did not
reach statistical significance. Between days 7 and 28, myocardial
perfusion increased significantly in the MAPC-treated mice and did
not change in the nontreated mice. However, differences in perfusion
between the treatment groups on day 28 did not reach statistical significance.
LV Function
LV volumes at end-systole and end-diastole were significantly larger
and LVEF was significantly lower in mice undergoing LAD ligation
compared to normal control mice (Figure 4). On day 7 after LAD ligation
, there were no significant differences in LVEDV, LVESV, and
LVEF according to treatment group. LVEDV significantly increased
between days 7 and 28 in both treatment groups, although the relative
increase tended to be less in the MAPC-treated mice. LVESV
significantly increased between days 7 and 28 only in untreated
mice. Accordingly, LVEF decreased in untreated mice, whereas
LVEF tended to increase in MAPC-treated mice. There was a modest
linear relation between the change in LVEF and the change in perfusion
(averaged for the mid and apical planes) between days 7 and 28
and a modest inverse relation between change in LVEF and the
change in the perfusion defect size summed for the mid and apical
planes (Figure 5).
Stroke volume was measured using both the volumetric technique
as well as the product of LV outflow tract area and Doppler timevelocity
integral (Figure 6). For both techniques, stroke volume in
normal control mice was higher than in both postinfarction groups

and 28, but this reached statistical significance only for the MAPC-
treated mice.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that echocardiographic assessment
of perfusion and LV function can be used to evaluate the effects
of stem cell therapy in a murine model of ischemic LV dysfunction.
Improvements in total myocardial perfusion and the spatial distribution
of perfusion produced by intramyocardial injection of MAPCs
could be quantified using MCE. The improvement in myocardial
perfusion in MAPC-treated mice was associated with less disadvantageous
ventricular remodeling and an improvement in LVEF.
Proangiogenic stem cell therapy is a promising approach for treating
severe angina and other ischemic symptoms in patients who are
not candidates for traditional revascularization techniques. The ability
to influence vascular remodeling is an important consideration for
endogenous myocardial repair. For example, stem cell–mediated improvements
in microvascular blood flow in patients with recent
myocardial infarctions or with viable but chronically dysfunctional
myocardium has been shown to also improve LVEF, reduce LVESV,
and improve functional status.15 It is also likely that the success of
‘‘regenerative’’ cell therapy to repopulate the myocellular content of
the injured heart is influenced by the reparative environment,
including the status of regional perfusion. Imaging techniques that
are able to spatially and temporally assess regional perfusion and LV
performance are of paramount importance for studying and optimizing
stem cell therapy.
Increasingly, the scientific community has relied on preclinical animal
models of cardiovascular disease, including murine models, to
test the efficacy and off-target effects of new therapies. Because of
the overwhelming clinical need, stem cells for promoting vascular remodeling
have been studied before complete preclinical characterization
of the effects of dose, timing, method of administration, and
influence of perfusion status on cell survival and function. The importance
of this issue is underscored by the heterogeneity in clinical trial
outcomes and even negative results in some clinical studies in which
stem cell therapy was used in ischemic LV dysfunction.16-18Advanced

imaging techniques are useful for addressing these knowledge gaps
and optimally would involve techniques that (1) can simultaneously
evaluate the effects of cell therapy on flow and function, (2) are
widely available to researchers, (3) are repeatable to provide
information over time, and (4) can be easily translated from animal
models to clinical studies.
MCE has been used to noninvasively quantify regional perfusion in
small and large animal models as well as humans with ischemic LV
dysfunction14,19-23 and has been applied in large animal models to
study growth factor–mediated angiogenesis.24 MCE has been used
to evaluate myocardial perfusion in pigs with recent myocardial infarctions
treated with either intramuscular injection of bone
marrow–derived stem cells or intravenous administration of autologous
mesenchymal stem cells.25,26 In this study, we demonstrated
for the first time that changes in myocardial perfusion after stem
cell therapy can be assessed with MCE in a murine model of
infarction and correlate with improvements in function.
In our study, we evaluated the proangiogenic effect of MAPCs.
These cells were chosen because they contain a wide variety of proangiogenic
compounds,7,27 have proven efficacy in increasing vascular
density in murine models of myocardial infarction and muscle
ischemia,6,7,9 and are currently in clinical trials in patients.28
Although there is controversy regarding the ability of MAPCs to
differentiate into multiple cell types, there is overwhelming evidence
that these cells trigger vascular remodeling. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that accelerated recovery of perfusion with MAPCs in
ischemic limbs occurs primarily through paracrine signaling and
recruitment of other proarteriogenic cells.7
Perfusion was evaluated in two short-axis slices that showed perfusion
defects 1 week after LAD ligation. We avoided both the basal region
, which typically lacked infarction, and the true apex, where
circumferential akinesis or dyskinesis was present in most animals.
The presence of tissue perfusion was determined by the spatial extent
of contrast signal late after a high–mechanical index pulse sequence
when full microbubble replenishment had occurred. With this
approach, myocardial contrast echocardiographic information on
the spatial extent of infarction correlates well with that derived
from single-photon emission computed tomography as well as delayed
gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance.21,29
MAPCs were delivered by percutaneous intramuscular injection,
and a border-zone region was targeted because of our previous observation
that accelerated recovery of perfusion occurs primarily
through remodeling of the existing arteriolar circulation.7 Consistent
with this previous study, optical imaging indicated that few
of the transplanted cells survive by 7 days after injection, suggesting
that persistent paracrine effects rather than engraftment was the
dominant mechanism for vascular remodeling.

Compared with untreated controls, mice treated with MAPCs had
greater recovery of perfusion and greater reduction in defect size,
defined by the area completely lacking perfusion, although there
was considerable heterogeneity in the response. The MAPC-treated
animals also had less adverse remodeling between days 7 and 28,
indicated by smaller increases in LVEDV and LVESV. In the MAPC-
treated group, the increase in LVESV was smaller than the increase
in LVEDV, resulting in an increase in the calculated LVEF. The change
in LVEF was linearly related to the change in perfusion and inversely
to the change in perfusion defect size. These correlations were, however
, only modest, probably because (1) functional data were based
on global LV evaluation, whereas myocardial perfusion was assessed
only in two short-axis planes, and (2) data analysis was not controlled
for the baseline total infarct size. Nonetheless, these data indicate that
despite the spatial resolution limitations in small animal models of disease
, the interplay among perfusion, LV function, and LV geometry in
cell therapy can be characterized.
Our results raise important mechanistic questions regarding the
relation between flow and function after stem cell therapy for
ischemic LV dysfunction. Because MAPCs were injected 7 days after
infarction, we do not believe that the proangiogenic effects resulted in
greater myocardial salvage. It is possible that improved perfusion at
the infarct borders in MAPC-treated animals permitted endogenous
myocellular regeneration in this area. There is a much more likely
explanation. Although defect size on MCE was defined as the region
that completely lacked perfusion, it is quite likely that border-zone regions
that were viable, hypoperfused, and not quantified as part of the
defect were benefited by MAPC-mediated vascular remodeling, resulting
in improved function. We do not, however, have confidence
that the contrast-specific myocardial contrast echocardiographic imaging
algorithm used in this study can spatially resolve subtle changes
in flow in border-zone regions and, hence, used a defect size (complete
absence of perfusion) as an indicator for an angiogenic response.
There were several other limitations in this study. With regard to
the cells used, we did not evaluate dose response and used xenogenic
cell therapy. We also imaged used several key short-axis images for
MCE rather than attempting to quantify total perfusion defect
mass. Our decision to use several short-axis frames was based on difficulties
in evaluating the true apex, which in mice becomes aneurysmal
and very thin and entirely lacks perfusion after LAD ligation.
Although we used same-plane microsphere technique to validate
perfusion defect area, we did not perform any complementary
methods to validate LV functional and geometric data. However, it
is reassuring that the echocardiographic values for LV volumes,
LVEF, and stroke volume in normal control mice and post–LAD ligation
mice are in line with those obtained by murine cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging.30 It should be noted, however, that more
advanced methods for evaluating function, such as with regional
speckle-based strain analysis, were not performed. Control animals
did not undergo sham operations, because no perfusion or functional
abnormalities have been found in previous studies.12,31 Finally, our
differences in LV function are small and of unknown clinical
significance.
CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that echocardiographic imaging of perfusion
and function in mice can provide important information on temporal
changes in myocardial blood flow and LV function in response to intramyocardial
injection of stem cells in the nonacute phase of myocardial
infarction. These results are likely to provide justification for
applying these techniques for preclinical testing of cell therapy.
