ABSTRACT
Rationale: Cerebral ischemia upregulates aquaporin-4 expression, increases blood-brain barrier
(BBB) permeability, and induces brain edema. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can repress inflammatory
cytokines and show great potential for ischemic stroke therapy. However, the effect of
MSCs regarding the protection of ischemia-induced BBB break down is unknown. Objective: We
test whether MSCs therapy protects BBB integrity and explore the molecular mechanisms of
aquaporin-4 on BBB integrity. Methods and Results: Two hundred and twenty-eight adult CD1
male mice underwent 90 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 2 3
105 MSCs intracranial transplantation. The neurological severity score was improved and both
ischemia-induced brain edema and BBB leakage were reduced in MSC-treated mice. MSCs therapy
reduced astrocyte apoptosis and inhibited ischemia-induced aquaporin-4 upregulation. In addition,
small-interfering RNA knockdown of aquaporin-4 after cerebral ischemia effectively reduced
aquaporin-4 expression, brain edema, BBB leakage, and astrocyte apoptosis. Conditional medium
from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia enhanced aquaporin-4 expression, p38 and JNK
phosphorylation, and apoptosis of cultured astrocytes. MSC treatment reduced the expression of
inflammatory cytokines in LPS-activated microglia, and subsequently reduced aquaporin-4 expression
and apoptosis of astrocytes. Knockdown of aquaporin-4 in cultured astrocytes also reduced
apoptosis. Treatment with p38 and JNK inhibitors showed that p38, but not the JNK signaling
pathway, was responsible for the aquaporin-4 upregulation. Conclusion: MSCs protected BBB
integrity by reducing the apoptosis of astrocytes after ischemic attack, which was due to the
attenuation of inflammatory response and downregulation of aquaporin-4 expression via p38
signaling pathway.STEMCELLS 2014;32:3150–3162
INTRODUCTION
Brain edema exacerbates various brain injuries,
including traumatic brain injury and ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke, among others [1–3]. Preventing
brain edema with stem cell transplantation
, drug administration, or exogenous target
gene transduction could improve neurobehavioral
outcomes [4–7]. Studies have demonstrated
that inflammatory cytokines contribute significantly
to the development of brain edema
by disrupting blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity
[4, 8]. However, those studies mainly focused
on the interaction between inflammatory cytokines
and vascular endothelium; the effect of
inflammatory cytokines on astrocytes after
ischemic stroke was not explored.
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein
expressed on the end-feet of astrocytes,
has been widely studied as an inflammatory
mediator [9]. When the brain is damaged, the
changes of osmotic pressure alter transport
systems and drive water into astrocytes, ultimately
causing astrocytes to swell [10, 11]. This
process is closely involved with AQP4 upregulation.
Inhibiting AQP4 upregulation after brain
injury has shown optimistic effects for the
prognosis [12]. Moreover, AQP4 is upregulated
in inflammation related diseases, which implies
an innate relationship between the release of
inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of
AQP4 [13]. While there is evidence of AQP4
upregulation, the underlying molecular mechanism
of AQP4 upregulation is unknown.
As a treatment option for ischemic stroke,
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is under
extensive investigation. Other than directly
engrafting into the lesion site [14], the therapeutic
effect of MSCs seems to be due to secretory
factors like neurotrophins, chemokines, and
cytokines [15, 16]. MSCs have also been documented
to hamper experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis [17, 18] and graft-versus-host
disease [19]. Bone marrow-derived MSCs could

also reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines such
as IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 in astrocyte cultures [20]. These therapeutic
benefits are the result of immunomodulatory properties
of MSCs. However, very limited studies have focused on the
effect of MSCs on microglia. The aim of this study is to explore
(a) whether MSCs therapy attenuates BBB breakdown and
reduces brain edema following transient ischemia; (b) the role
of MSCs in maintaining BBB integrity; and (c) the molecular
mechanism of AQP4 in MSCs therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Group
Adult male CD1 mice (n5228) were randomly divided into 10
groups: in the MSCs transplantation study, (a) sham group, (b)
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group, (c) MSC-treated group,
n542–51 per group. We added additional control (human umbilical
vein endothelial cell [HUVEC]) group (d) to explore whether
othercelllinesareasefficientasMSCs( n512). In the mechanistic
study, (e) sham group, (f) vehicle group, (g) P38 inhibitor
(SB239063) treated group, n56–9 per group. In the AQP4 interference
study, (h) PBS group, (i) scrambled small-interfering RNA
(siRNA)group,and(j)siAQP4group,n515 per group.
MSCs Isolation and Identification
Animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University, Shanghai, China. All animals were housed in a SPF
animal room with free access to water and food.
Bone-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were isolated and harvested
as previously described [21]. Briefly, adult male SD (Sprague
Dawley) rats (Sippr-BK, Co., Shanghai, China, http://www.
sippr-bk.cn) weighing 200–250 g were sacrificed. BMSCs were
flushed from the femoral and tibial bones. The cells were suspended
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, www.lifetechnologies.com) with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
and then incubated at 37C with 5% CO
2
. The medium containing
nonadherent cells was discarded 24 hours later; and
fresh medium was added. After isolation, the medium was
changed every 3 days, and the primary cells were subcultured
1:2 when 80% confluence.
Identification was performed by flow cytometry to examine
the surface markers CD90 (1:100, Ebioscience, San Diego,
CA, www.ebioscience.com), CD29 (1:100, Ebioscience, Sandiego
, CA), CD31 (1:100, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON,
www.bdbiosciences.com), and CD45 (1:100, Ebioscience, San
Diego, CA) of cultured cells [22]. Cells (2 3 105) were incubated
in a 200 ml buffer (PBS with 2 ml of CD29-APC, CD90-
cy5.5, CD31-PE, FITC-CD45, isotope control antibodies, respectively
) for 20 minutes on ice followed by three washes with
PBS. Next, the cells were suspended in 200 ml of PBS and analyzed
in an FACS instrument (BD Biosciences, mississauga,
ON). For cellular tracking after transplantation, cells were
labeled using Dil (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or
adenovirus-GFP (AD-GFP) in some experiments.
Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) according to previous studies
[23]. Briefly, adult male CD1 mice (25–30 g) were anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg, Sigma-
Aldrich, San Louis, MO, www.sigmaaldrich.com). A heating
pad (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China, www.rwdstco.com)
was used to maintain the body temperature at 37C60.3C.
After the common carotid artery, the external carotid artery
(ECA), and the internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated; a
suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, www.covidien.com) coated
with silicon was inserted from the ECA stump into the ICA,
and stopped at the opening of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The distance from the furcation of the ECA/ICA to the
opening of the MCA was 960.5 mm. Reperfusion was performed
90 minutes after MCAO with suture withdrawal. To
confirm successful occlusion and reperfusion, cerebral blood
flow was measured in the left MCA territory using laser Doppler
flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Devon, U.K., www.moor.co.
uk). The sham-operated mice were subjected to the same procedure
except for the suture insertion.
MSCs Transplantation and siRNA Knockdown of AQP4
MSCs or siRNA were injected within 20 minutes after reperfusion.
The animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine
intraperitoneally, and received stereotaxic transplantation. A
small skull hole was made using a microsurgical drill followed
by a 10 ml Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland,
www.hamiltoncompany.com) injection. The transplant coordinate
was 2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture and 1 mm posterior
to the coronal suture. The syringe was lowered into the
brain 3 mm under the Dura. MSCs suspension with 2 3 105
cells in 5 ml PBS was injected at a rate of 0.4 ml/minute. Four
siRNA duplexes against AQP4 (400 ng, siAQP4; Gene Pharma,
Shanghai, China, www.genepharma.com) and nontargeting
siRNA (400 ng, scrambled RNA; Gene Pharma, Shanghai,
China) were mixed with INTERFERin (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch
, France, www.polyplus-transfection.com) at a final volume
of 5 ml and incubated for 20 minutes before injection. A
second siRNA injection was repeated 2 days later in all animals
using the same injection protocol [24]. After completion
of the injection, the needle was slowly withdrawn from the
animals. The hole was sealed with bone wax and the wound
was closed. PBS, HUVECs, or scrambled siRNA was injected
separately as controls. The sham-operated mice were subjected
to the same procedure except for injection.
Neurological Severity Score Determination
At 1 and 3 days after tMCAO, modified Neurological severity
scores (mNSS) testing was performed to assess the neurological
status of the animals, which included motor, sensory, balance
, and reflex tests (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score,
14) [25]. For the motor test, the animal was raised by the tail
and the flexion of its forelimb was observed (0–3), and its
gait was observed after being placed on the floor (0–3). Beam
balance tests were performed to look into the animals’ posture
on a beam (0–6). The reflexes absent test (0–2) included
the pinna reflex and the corneal reflex.
Brain Water Content and BBB Permeability Assay
Mice were sacrificed at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO with a high
dose of chloral hydrate (10%) anesthesia. Brain samples were
weighed before and after dehydration in an oven at 95C for 
24 hours. Brain water content was calculated using the

the extravasation of Evans Blue (EB, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, www.sigmaaldrich.com) and IgG. EB dye solution
(2% in saline, 4 ml/kg) was injected through the left jugular
vein at 1 and 3 days following tMCAO. After 2 hours of circulation
, the mice were sacrificed for transcardial perfusion. The
brain hemispheres were weighed and then EB was extracted

by homogenizing the samples in 1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic
acid solution followed by centrifuging at 12,000g for 20
minutes. The supernatant was diluted with 100% ethanol at a
ratio of 1:3. The amount of EB was quantified at 610 nm by a
spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, www.biotek.com).
IgG was examined as previously described [26]. Briefly, brain
slices were incubated with biotinylated antibody for 30
minutes after fixation and blocked before incubating in ABC
reagent (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, www.vectorlabs.com)
for 30 minutes. The immunoreactivity was visualized using
DAB (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) staining and slices were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Six fields were randomly
selected from the area of interest for each section and analyzed
by Image Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics,
Bethesda, MD, www.mediacy.com) for mean integrated optical
density (IOD) analysis.
Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry
Cultured astrocytes or brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 5 minutes and then incubated in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature
followed by blocking with 10% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature.
Astrocytes were incubated with anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4,
1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, www.scbt.com)
and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:1,000, Millipore, Bedford
, MA, www.emdmillipore.com) antibodies. Brain sections
were incubated with antibodies against occludin (1:200, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, 1:200,
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), CD31 (1:200, R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, www.rndsystems.com), AQP4 (1:200, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and GFAP (1:1,000, Millipore
, Bedford, MA) overnight at 4C. After rinsing three times
with PBS, the cells and sections were incubated with fluorescence
conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
AQP4 staining for cultured astrocytes was computed
as mean IOD. For ZO-1, or occludin staining, the gap length was
presented as percentage (%) of whole tight junction staining.
Similarly, six fields were randomly selected from each section
and the data were analyzed by Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. For
apoptosis analysis, apoptotic astrocytes were stained with GFAP
and then counterstained with TUNEL using an in situ cell death
detection kit (Roche, Penzberg, Germany, www.roche.com).
TUNEL-positive cells merged with GFAP signal were counted as
apoptotic astrocytes. Quantification of those cells was analyzed
along the ischemic penumbra area.
Real-Time PCR Analysis
Total RNA from microglial cells and brain tissue samples was
isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
The concentration of RNA was measured by a spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop1000, Thermo Fisher, Wilmington, DE, www.
thermofisher.com) followed by a reverse transcription process
using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China, www.
takara.com.cn). The cDNA was used to perform Real-Time PCR
by SYBR Premix Ex Tag Kit (TaKaRa, DaLian, China). A two
stage RT-PCR amplification reaction was performed under the
following conditions: 95C for 30 seconds followed by 40
cycles of 95C for 5 seconds and 60C for 30 seconds. The
primer sequences are listed in Table 1.
Western Blot Analysis
The brain tissue samples and astrocytes were collected and
sonicated in homogenizing buffer (RIPA with protease cocktail
inhibitor, phosphatase inhibitor, and Phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000g and
the pellets were discarded. Protein concentrations were
determined using a BCA kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA)
and equal amounts of the samples were loaded onto 10%
resolving gel for electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh
, PA, www.gelifesciences.com) and blocked with 5%
skim milk, then membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies against AQP4 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Crus, CA), phospho-p38 (p-p38, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling

Preparation of MSCs Conditional Medium and
Microglia Conditional Medium
MSCs cultured in a 10 cm dish (Corning Incorporated, Corning
, NY, www.corning.com) at a density of 1.5 3 106 cells
were used for this experiment, fresh medium was added and
followed by 24 hours of incubation at 37C. The medium was
collected and filtered for the following experiments. The BV-2
cells, immortalized mouse microglial cells, were plated in sixwell
plates and allowed to grow to 70% confluence (2 or 3
days), and then MSCs conditional medium (MCM) or fresh
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS was added to each well
and incubated for 24 hours. The medium was then renewed
and supplemented with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (500 ng/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After another 24 hours of incubation
, the LPS-contained medium was replaced with a fresh
medium. The medium was then collected and filtered for further
experiments after 24 hours of incubation. Untreated cells
were included as a control. These mediums were termed as
microglia conditional medium (CM), LPS-activated microglia
conditional medium (ACM), and MSC-treated LPS-activated
microglia conditional medium (MACM).
Microglia Total RNA Extraction
BV-2 cells were plated in six-well plates and allowed to grow
to 70% confluence (2 or 3 days). MCM or a fresh medium was
added to each well and incubated for 24 hours. The medium
was then renewed and supplemented with LPS (500 ng/ml).
After another 24 hours of incubation, cells were washed with
PBS and Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was
added to each well for the extraction of total RNA.
Astrocyte Isolation and Treatment Protocol
Astrocytes were prepared from the C57BL/6 mice at the stage
of P0 described previously [27]. Before experimental
treatments, astrocyte cultures were passaged once in six-well
plates. Cells were allowed to reach 90% confluence. CM,
ACM, or MACM was added to each well and allowed to incubate
for 24 hours. In mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition
studies, p38 and JNK inhibitors (SB239063 and SP600125,
Gene Operation, Ann Arbor, MI, www.geneoperation.com)
were added at the concentration of 10 mM with ACM.
Untreated cells were included as a control.
Astrocyte and bEnd.3 Cell Coculturing and Tight
Junction Protein Expression in bEnd.3 Cells
Astrocytes at a density of 33 105 cells per well were plated
into six-well plates and then siRNA of AQP4 was added followed
by 2 days of incubation. Then, ACM was added to each
well with or without AQP4 knockdown. One day later, these
treated astrocytes were cocultured with bEnd.3 (ATCC, Manassas
, VA, www.atcc.org) cells plated on the trans-well membranes
of an inner well at a density of 23 105/cm2. After 3
days of coculture, protein of bEnd.3 cells was harvested for
Western blot examination.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean6SD. Statistical analysis was
performed by SPSS for both parametric and nonparametric
comparisons. Differences with p values<.05 were considered
significant.
RESULTS
MSCs Identification and Transplantation
The cultured cells demonstrated a typical spindle-shaped morphology
(Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry analysis showed that more
than 99% of cells were CD29 and CD90 positive while less than
1% were CD31 and CD45 positive, which was highly consistent
with previous studies [22]. For cell tracking, we labeled MSCs
with AD-GFP and examined the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
positive cells 3 days after transplantation. The results suggest
that a considerable number of transplanted cells were detectable
(Fig. 1B). We also labeled the cells with Dil and found the
nuclei of the injected cells were clear and merged with Dil dye
at day 3 after tMCAO (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Both
results suggested that transplanted cells were still alive.
MSCs Therapy Improved Neurological Outcomes,
Attenuated Brain Edema, and BBB Leakage
To explore the effects of MSCs on neurological outcomes, we
examined the neurological deficits at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO
using mNSS. We found that the neurological deficits in the
MSCs group of mice were significantly attenuated compared to
the PBS or HUVEC group at days 1 and 3 (Fig. 2A, p<.05).
Water content was measured to determine the brain edema.
We found that the water content of the ipsilateral hemisphere
in MSC-treated mice was significantly lower compared to the
controlmiceafter1and3daysofMCAO( p<.05). In contrast,
no significant difference was observed between PBS and
HUVEC group. To evaluate BBB permeability after ischemic
brain injury, EB and IgG protein extravasation were measured.
We demonstrated that MSCs remarkably reduced the EB leakage
in the ipsilateral side, which indicated that BBB integrity
was protected by MSCs treatment (Fig. 2B, p<.05). Further
study confirmed that extravasated IgG was significantly
increased after tMCAO while it was markedly decreased in the
MSC-treated mice compared to the controls (Fig. 2C, p<.05).
To investigate the mechanism of BBB disruption, we analyzed
the localization of occludin and ZO-1 in cerebral vascular structures
using CD31/occludin and CD31/ZO-1 double staining. Confocal
microscopy analysis showed that the occludin and ZO-1
positive staining was continuously located on the endothelial
cell margin of cerebral microvessels in sham mice; this continuity
was disrupted by ischemic injury (Fig. 2D). It was noted that
this process was reversed and gap formation was greatly
reduced in the MSC-treated mice after tMCAO (p<.05).
MSCs Attenuated Astrocyte Apoptosis and Suppressed
AQP4 Upregulation in the Ischemic Penumbra Region
Astrocytes are very important for maintaining the integrity of
the BBB [28]. To examine whether MSCs therapy after tMCAO
had an optimistic effect on astrocyte survival, we performed
TUNEL/GFAP double staining. No apoptosis cells were found in
control mice while ischemia induced a significant increase in
apoptotic astrocytes (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the increase in apoptotic
astrocytes following tMCAO was significantly reduced in
MSC treated mice (p<.01). Brain injury-induced AQP4 upregulation
contributes to astrocyte swelling, which leads to an apoptosis
of astrocytes and to the breakdown of the BBB [12]. To
explore the potential relationship between BBB disruption and
AQP4 expression, we examined the AQP4 at mRNA and protein

levels. Results showed that AQP4 expression was upregulated
following 1 and 3 days of tMCAO. MSCs therapy significantly
reduced the AQP4 upregulation at day 3 (Fig. 3B). We further
found AQP4 upregulation was mainly located in the ischemic
peri-focal region. Brain injury-induced AQP4 upregulation was
significantly reduced in the MSC-treated mice (Fig. 3C).
MSCs Decreased Inflammatory Response and
Astrocyte Apoptosis
To determine whether the effect of MSCs on AQP4 expression
after tMCAO is involved in the immunomodulatory influence
of MSCs, we examined IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a mRNA
Figure 4.

expression both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated that IL-
1b, IL-6, and TNF-a mRNA were increased at days 1 and 3 following
tMCAO. The three cytokines significantly decreased in
MSC-treated mice at day 3 compared to the controls (Fig. 4A,
p<.05). These findings were confirmed by in vitro gene
expression data using the BV-2 cell line (Fig. 4B, p<.05). We
further used the conditional medium of BV-2 to confirm
whether inflammatory cytokines contributed to the AQP4
upregulation in cultured astrocytes. We demonstrated that
LPS-activated microglia conditional medium (ACM) induced
AQP4 expression sharply compared to controls. The induction
of AQP4 in the MACM was much less than that in the ACM
group (Fig. 4C, p<.05). To determine the effect of AQP4 on
astrocyte apoptosis, we used AQP4 siRNA to treat cultured
astrocytes stimulated by ACM. We demonstrated that AQP4
knockdown reduced ACM induced astrocyte apoptosis
(p<.01). Our results also showed that MACM induced less
apoptosis of astrocytes when compared with ACM (Fig. 4D,
p<.01). The AQP4 knocking down efficiency was examined by
RT-PCR and immunofluorescence (Fig. 4E, p<.01). Coculture
of astrocytes and bEnd.3 cells increased the occludin expression
in bEnd.3 cells. ACM-treated astrocytes induced weaker
occludin expression in bEnd.3 cells while AQP4 knockdown
and ACM-treated astrocytes maintained occludin expression
(Fig. 4F, p<.01).
P38 Was Involved in AQP4 Upregulation in Astrocytes
After Microglia Conditional Medium Stimulation
To study the potential mechanism of AQP4 upregulation in
astrocytes stimulated by CM, ACM, and MACM; p38, JNK, and
ERK1/2 were examined 24 hours later by Western blot analysis.
We found that p38 and JNK phosphorylation increased
after CM, ACM, and MACM treatment. The increase was
milder in the MACM group compared to the ACM group
(p<.05). At the same time, the increase was also significant
in ACM-treated group compared to the CM-treated group
(Fig. 5A, p<.05). To further elucidate whether JNK, p38, or
both pathways were involved in AQP4 upregulation, we compared
the effect of p38 and JNK inhibitors (SB239063 and
SP600125) on AQP4 expression. As shown in Figure 5B, 10
mM of SB203580, but not 10 mM of SP600125 significantly
reduced AQP4 expression (p<.05). The validity of these two
inhibitors was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C).
We then detected p38 activation and AQP4 expression in vivo
after tMCAO. The results revealed that SB203580 effectively
dampened AQP4 upregulation after tMCAO. The effectiveness
of the p38 inhibitor was confirmed (Fig. 5D, p<.05).
Knockdown of AQP4 Reduced Brain Edema, BBB
Disruption, and Astrocyte Apoptosis
To further investigate the effects of AQP4 on edema formation
, BBB disruption, and astrocyte apoptosis, siRNAs against
AQP4 were injected after tMCAO. The knockdown efficiency
was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot
analysis (Fig. 6A, p<.01). Our results showed that the knockdown
of AQP4 reduced brain edema (Water content: PBS,
84.6%60.6%, Scrambled, 84.4%60.4%, siAQP4,
81.4%60.4%; p<.05, PBS vs. siAQP4, Scrambled vs. siAQP4),
IgG leakage, and astrocyte apoptosis (Fig. 6B, 6C, p<.01)
when compared with PBS or the scrambled siRNA control
group.
DISCUSSION
We focused on the protective effects of MSCs on BBB permeability
since maintaining BBB integrity is pivotal for reducing
secondary brain injury following cerebral ischemia. The disturbance
of BBB function is related to several pathological
changes in the CNS, such as stroke attack, head trauma, Parkinson
’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease [28]. BBB disruption
directly resulting from vascular endothelial damage potentially
aggravates vasogenic edema and worsens prognosis [29]. Conditional
medium from MSCs preserved vascular endothelial
integrity in pulmonary endothelial cells by preserving adherens
junction [30]. This finding was also confirmed in human
umbilical vascular endothelial cell studies [31]. Another report
showed that TIMP3 released by MSCs could stabilize BBB
integrity following traumatic brain injury [32]. In this study,
we demonstrated that MSCs therapy is beneficial to maintaining
BBB integrity following ischemic stroke. Our results support
that this was due to an attenuated inflammatory
response and reduced apoptosis of astrocytes.
Figure 4. MSCs diminished the upregulation of AQP4 by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. (A): Modulation of inflammatory
cytokine gene expression in vivo. The relative mRNA expression of IL-1b (a), IL-6 (b), and TNF-a (c) normalized to GAPDH was
detected at days 1 and 3 following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The expression of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a mRNA was significantly
decreased in the MSC-treated group at day 3 compared to the PBS group, however, at day 1, only IL-1b was significantly reduced
in the MSC-treated group compared to the PBS group. n56 per group. (B): Influence of MSCs conditional medium on proinflammatory

MSC-treated microglia conditional medium induced more moderate upregulation of AQP4 in cultured astrocytes. Immunofluorescence

expression was examined in control (b), CM (c), ACM (d), and MACM (e) treated astrocytes, scale bar5100 mm. Quantifying the expression
of AQP4 showed that ACM induced the fiercest upregulation of AQP4, which was significant when compared with CM and MACM
and suggested that it was the inflammatory cytokines that were responsible for the induction of AQP4. (D): AQP4 knockdown reduced
apoptosis in cultured astrocytes. Few apoptotic astrocytes (white arrows) were found in control (a) and CM-treated astrocytes (b). AQP4
knockdown (e) reduced ACM (c) induced astrocyte apoptosis. MACM (d) was also found to induce less apoptosis of astrocytes when compared

induced weaker expression of occludin in bEnd.3 cells (CA) while AQP4 knockdown as well as ACM treated astrocytes maintained occludin

Proinflammatory cytokines were capable of disrupting the epithelial
barrier by decreasing tight junction protein expression
[33, 34]. Therefore, we believe that the effect of MSCs on
BBB integrity was from the suppression of proinflammatory
cytokine production, which directly resulted in less gap formation
of tight junction protein. In addition, astrocyteendothelial
crosstalk is important to maintain the function of
the BBB. Astrocytes contributed to BBB formation by inducing
the BBB phenotypic characteristics of endothelial cells [28,
35]. Furthermore, astrocytes also showed a capability to promote
tight junction formation in the brain capillary endothelium
[36, 37].
It is noted that different type of cells such as neurons
from fetal brain, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from
umbilical cord blood, neural stem cells (NSCs), neural
progenitor cells, and embryonic stem cells have been reported
to be effective in the treatment of experimental stroke animals.
The therapeutic benefits of these cells are probably due
to neuroprotection and regeneration by promoting neurogenesis
and angiogenesis [37–40]. However, each cell type has its
own properties and molecular mechanism in the repair of
ischemic stroke. For example, EPCs could increase vascular
endothelial growth factor level and promote angiogenesis
[23]. NSCs were capable of differentiating into neurons and
contributed to neurogenesis, thus inducing regeneration of
damaged brain tissue. Moreover, NSCs transplantation also
showed anti-inflammatory properties in hemorrhagic stroke
and decreased apoptosis and brain edema [41].
We chose rat bone marrow-derived MSCs because we
want to explore therapeutic effects of exogenous stem cell
on mice after tMCAO. Previous studies revealed that human
derived stem cells had positive effects on ischemic mice or
rat [42, 43]. In addition, bone marrow-derived MSCs had
low immunogenicity and had immunosuppressive effect on
graft-versus-host disease [44, 45]. We found that MSC treatment
reduced apoptotic astrocytes in ischemia, which we
believe significantly contributed to the BBB integrity. In
addition, our in vitro data showed that astrocytes were
capable of inducing occludin over-expression in bEnd.3 cells,
indicating that astrocytes do regulate the function of endothelial
cells.
Downregulated AQP4 expression could explain the beneficial
effects of MSCs on astrocytes in the ischemic mouse
brain. Brain water content and swelling of astrocyte foot processes
in AQP4-deficient mice were significantly reduced in a
model of brain edema [12]. Further study showed that
reduced astrocyte edema at an early time point subsequently
led to fewer apoptotic astrocytes in an oxidative stress model
[46]. We demonstrated that MSCs effectively downregulated
AQP4 expression and reduced astrocyte apoptosis after ischemic
injury, suggesting that AQP4 was a key target in the
induction of astrocyte apoptosis. Our in vitro data also
showed that AQP4 knockdown reduced apoptotic astrocytes.
The mechanism of AQP4 downregulation in astrocytes
could be due to the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs.
Here, we showed MSCs significantly reduced inflammatory
cytokine production both in vivo and in vitro. We found that
the time course of inflammatory cytokine release and AQP4
expression were associated, implying an intrinsic relationship
between them. We further explored the relationship between
inflammatory cytokines, AQP4, and p38. The ACM could
increase AQP4 expression via activating p38 and JNK signaling
pathways while the increase of AQP4 in CM-treated astrocytes
was much less, suggesting that it is the inflammatory

cytokines (IL-1b, IL6, and TNF-a) released by the microglia
that induced the upregulation of AQP4. AQP4 upregulation
was more moderate in MCAM-treated astrocytes further confirming
that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for
AQP4 upregulation. It was noted that p38 and JNK activation
occurred in activated astrocytes. Nevertheless, our study displayed
that only the p38 pathway was involved in AQP4
upregulation, suggesting that p38 played a crucial role in the
mediation of AQP4 over-expression. However, the receptor
that mediated the activation of p38 in response to inflammatory
cytokines was not under investigation. IL-1 receptor
type1 may be involved in this process [47]. Although a number
of studies have shown that the p38 signaling pathway
plays an important role in regulation of AQP4 expression [48],
our study was the first to report that inflammatory cytokines
took the responsibility for the upregulation of AQP4 by activating
the p38 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study shows for the first time that MSCs exert a potent
regulating function on AQP4 expression in astrocytes, which
consequently attenuates astrocyte apoptosis, ischemiainduced
BBB disruption, and brain edema. The molecular
mechanism of AQP4 upregulation was through p38 but not
ERK1/2 or JNK signaling pathways in response to inflammatory
cytokines. Based on these findings, we believe that the
effect of MSCs on the ischemic brain is associated with the
integrity of the BBB and edema formation, which represents a
novel mechanism of MSC therapy (Supporting Information
Fig. S2).
