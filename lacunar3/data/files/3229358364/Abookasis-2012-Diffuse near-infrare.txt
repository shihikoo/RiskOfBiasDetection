Abstract. Heatstroke, a form of hyperthermia, is a life-threatening condition characterized by an elevated core body
temperature that rises above 40°C (104°F) and central nervous system dysfunction that results in delirium, convulsions
, or coma. Without emergency treatment, the victim lapses into a coma and death soon follows. The
study presented was conducted with a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) setup to assess the effects of
brain dysfunction that occurred during heatstroke in mice model (n ¼ 6). It was hypothesized that DRS can be
utilized in small animal studies to monitor change in internal brain tissue temperature during heatstroke injury
since it induces a sequence of pathologic changes that change the tissue composition and structure. Heatstroke
was induced by exposure of the mice body under general anesthesia, to a high ambient temperature. A type of DRS
in which the brain tissue was illuminated through the intact scalp with a broadband light source and diffuse
reflected spectra was employed, taking in the spectral region between 650 and 1000 nm and acquired at an
angle of 90 deg at a position on the scalp ∼12 mm from the illumination site. The temperature at the onset of
the experiment was∼34°C (rectal temperature) with increasing intervals of 1°C until mouse death. The increase
in temperature caused optical scattering signal changes consistent with a structural alteration of brain tissue, ultimately
resulting in death. We have found that the peak absorbance intensity and its second derivative at specific
wavelengths correlate well with temperature with an exponential dependence. Based on these findings, in order to
estimate the influence of temperature on the internal brain tissue a reflectance-temperature index was established
and was seen to correlate as well with measured temperature. Overall, results indicate variations in neural tissue
properties during heatstroke and the feasibility to monitor and assess internal temperature variations using DRS.
Although several approaches have described the rise in temperature and its impact on tissue, to the best of our
knowledge no information is available describing the ability to monitor temperature during heatstroke with
DRS. The motivation of this study was to successfully describe this ability. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

1 Introduction
Systemic hyperthermia in the body is manifested as three separate
entities: heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke, the
latter two being life-threatening.1–3Signs of systemic hyperthermia
include muscle cramps; excessive fatigue or weakness, or
both; loss of coordination; a slowing of reaction time; headache;
decrease comprehension; nausea and vomiting; and dizziness.
Unlike heat cramps and heat exhaustion, heatstroke is a true
medical emergency and is often fatal if not properly and
promptly treated.4–6Heat stroke occurs particularly in non-acclimated
individuals who are exposed to high environmental temperatures.
The body normally generates heat as a result of
metabolism, and the body is usually able to dissipate the heat
by either radiation of heat through the skin or by evaporation
of sweat. However, in extreme heat the thermal regulatory
mechanisms fail, and body temperature rises. Usually, above
40°C (104°F) brain damage occurs and death follows if vigorous
measures are not instituted.7,8 Thus, early diagnosis and proper
treatment are crucial for the patient’s survival. Immediate
cooling and support of organ-system function are the two
main therapeutic objectives in patients with heatstroke. Several
cooling methods have been presented in the literature including
immersion in water at different temperatures, evaporative
cooling, ice pack application, pharmacological treatment and
invasive techniques.9–11 The populations most susceptible to
heatstrokes are infants, older people in poor health (often
with associated heart diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases,
or on certain medications that make them vulnerable to heat
strokes), athletes, or outdoor workers physically exerting themselves
under the sun. Susceptibility is greater in those with a
disorder of the skin or sweat glands, and those taking anticholinergic
drugs (which reduce sweating). Overstrenuous activity,
unsuitable clothing, overeating, and drinking too much alcohol
are sometimes contributory factors. However, some individuals
can develop symptoms of heatstroke suddenly and rapidly without
warning.
It is widely accepted that heatstroke develops as a result of an
increase in body temperature leading to multiorgan damage.
Therefore, methods to monitor and measure changes in internal
temperature are important. Current clinical methods for

monitoring temperature are divided into two categories, invasive
and noninvasive. Techniques such as tympanic membrane
thermometry, zero heat flow, microwave radiometry, magnetic
resonance thermometry, and ultrasound thermometry besides
the conventional oral or rectal electronic thermometers are in
use.12,13However, accuracy, complexity, cost, portability, safety,
and continuous measurements can influence the suitability of
these techniques. For instance, rectal temperature may not
accurately reflect brain temperature, especially during global
ischemia. The development of a non-invasive device which
overcomes these factors will be vital in medical management
of heatstroke. Interest in using optical techniques is on the
rise as they possess many advantages such as being noninvasive,
portable, relative low cost, easy to maintain, can be used repeatedly
over a prolonged period of time with no adverse effects, and
offer both high spatial and temporal resolution.14–16 So far, several
researchers have successfully demonstrated the
feasibility of using optical techniques such as near-infrared
spectroscopy12,17–19 optical coherence tomography,20 laser
speckle imaging,21 and fiber-optics sensors22 to monitor
temperature changes in a noninvasive fashion from turbid
media as well as from living tissue.
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is an established tool
widely studied and used to investigate physiology below tissue
surface. It is a simple, low-cost, and noninvasive modality with
great potential for diagnostic applications as it is sensitive to
absorption and scattering properties of biological molecules
in tissue. Therefore, it has the potential to provide biochemical
composition (chromophores content) and morphology (structure
) information about biological tissue.23–28 The spectroscopy
of tissue is possible owing to the weak absorption of the tissue in
the near infrared (NIR) window (650 to 1000 nm). Classical
DRS platforms include a light source, detector (spectrograph),
and a pair of optical fibers separated by a fixed distance for
delivery (illuminating fiber) and collection (collecting fiber)
of light during measurements. Light entering the tissue undergoes
a combination of multiple scattering and absorption and the
reflected light from the tissue, called diffuse reflectance (R
d
), is
recorded by the detector fiber. The light intensity decreases
during its ‘banana path’ propagation according to the concentration
of the absorbing chromophores (hemoglobin, fat, and
water).29–31It has been shown that separation between the source
and the detection points determines the sensitivity of the measured
reflectance to the absorption coefficient (large separation
distances, >∼10 mm) and to the scattering coefficient (short
separation, <∼1mm ).32–39 Optical properties (absorption and
scattering) can be extracted from the captured radiation with
analytical models or Monte Carlo simulations. Even though
there are several ways to model the measured diffuse reflectance
spectra, in this work we used the two-source diffusion-based
model for tissue reflectance as described by Farrel et al.40
The use of diffusion theory is applicable here since: 1. measurements
are obtained far from the boundaries, 2. the sourcedetector
separation is ∼12 mm, and 3. the absorption effects
in brain tissue are less than the scattering (the brain medium
is very diffuse).
As mentioned, several research groups have used NIR spectroscopy
techniques to study the influence of temperature on
NIR spectra since both photon path length and refractive indices
are temperature dependent and because of the strong
temperature-sensitivity of water absorption, which is reflected
in intensity changes and wavelength shifts around its peak at
970 nm.18,41–44 In addition, the effects of temperature on
major tissue absorbers such as hemoglobin and water have
been studied elsewhere.45,46 Works were obtained also to measure
glucose under temperature perturbation.47–50 The aim of
this study is to continue exploring this possibility in the
wavelength range from 650 to 1000 nm during heatstroke
with a different approach and configuration. We point out
three differences as compared to the other techniques. First,
we focus here on the temperature dependence of the absorbance
spectra shift and its second derivative characteristics at specific
wavelengths to evaluate the internal temperature of brain tissue.
Second, in our setup the source and detector are orthogonal to
each other on a curved brain surface with∼12 mm separation.
Finally, we assume that during changes in temperature there are
changes in tissue concentrations such as hemoglobin and water.
These molecules absorb specific wavelengths of light which
alters the optical properties of tissue and consequentially alter
the shape of the diffuse optical spectra. Therefore, we hypothesize
that DRS can be used to monitor change in internal brain
tissue temperature during heatstroke injury.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Animal Preparation
The study protocol described below was reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Ariel
University Center. Adult male mice (Sabra, aged eight to ten
weeks, weight 45 to 50 g) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal
(IP) injection of combination of ketamine (100 mg∕kg) and
xylazine (16 mg∕kg). The depth of anesthesia was ascertained
by pinching of the toes or tail and by monitoring rate of breathing.
Head was fixed and the hair was removed using hair
removal cream. A folded heating plate (Thermo plate, Tokai
Hit) was placed under the mouse to control the body temperature
and a thermocouple rectal probe (YSI) was inserted ∼2cmto
measure core body temperature. Hereafter, the temperature discussed
is in reference to the measurements provided by the YSI
probe. The mouse body was wrapped with aluminum foil to
keep body temperature at a desired level. In live animals,
heat is rapidly distributed throughout the body by circulating
blood maintaining a uniform core body temperature. Thus a
temperature gradient is not a concern for this experimental
setup. A heating pad is widely used in rodent experiments to
maintain a physiologic core body temperature during anesthesia.
Heatstroke could be induced by viral or bacterial toxins, drugs
(amphetamines, atropine, calcium antagonists, etc.), exercise, or
exposure to a hot environment. As mentioned above, we choose
the current model because of its simplicity and its popularity
among research groups. Future research will consider changing
this model and animal study. Other physiological parameters
such as heart rate, and SpO
2
(arterial oxygen saturation) were
monitored simultaneously using pulse oximeter (Nonin,
8650). All mice were kept in their habitual environment until
the day of the experiment. Heatstroke was induced by increasing
the temperature of the folded heating plate (available up to
50°C). Baseline reflectance measurements were obtained for
10 min prior to external induction of hyperthermia. Thus
each mouse served as its own control, decreasing the number
of animals required for the study. All mice (n ¼ 6) underwent
the same procedure. The measurements were started from baseline
body temperature with increases of 1°C in interval times
of∼3 min between measurements until mouse death. Table 1

presents the experimental details per mouse. As can be seen,
heatstroke (death) occurred at an average temperature of
40°C. This is lower than the conventional heatstroke level
found in other mammals (∼42°C) such as rats, dogs, rabbits51
and is likely due to the small body feature of the individual
mouse. The environmental temperature was measured
continuously during the experiments with an liquid crystal
display (LCD) digital thermometer (Extech Instrument) and
was 231°C.
2.2 Instrumentation
AschematicdiagramofthesetupisdrawnschematicallyinFig.1.
The setup consists of a wideband light source, two optical fibers,
spectrometer, temperature controller, pulse oximeter, rectal
probe, and a computer station with control software. The lamp
inside the light source (Stockler & Yale, Inc., M1000) was
replaced with a broadband quartz-tungsten-halogen (EIKO,
EXR) to gives a smooth broadband spectral profile along the
NIRregionandstableintensityovertime.Oneoftheopticalfibers
(illuminating fiber) is connected to this light source with a
diameter of D ¼ 5mm . The light emanating from the brain is
delivered to the spectrometer (Stellarnet, EPP2000) via the secondopticalfiber
(collectingfiber,D ¼ 2mm )positionedperpendicular
to the first fiber; That is, the diffuse reflectance was
collected by the second fiber-optic probe that was mounted on
the surface of the mice scalp at 90° to the brain surface and
connected to a spectrometer (see Fig. 1).
In this configuration, the reflected light collected by the collection
fiber propagates through the brain layers (scalp, skull,
CSF, gray, and white matter). But at our source detector separation
the dominant signal is from photons passing through the
brain. Hence the detected signal is sensitive to changes in optical
property from the brain. The reflected signal is then dispersed
and detected by the charge coupled device (CCD) array in the
spectrometer. The spectrometer system has a 2048-elements linear
CCD array with 12-bit resolution, and with a spectral range
from 240 to 1200 nm. The spectrometer was controlled by a
laptop computer running Windows operating system and is connected
to the USB port of the computer. Spectrometer interface
software was used between the spectrometer and the computer
to display the optical reflectance in real-time. Both fibers were
connected to a mechanical stage translation for position control
and care was taken to ensure full contact between the probes and
the brain surface throughout the experiments.
2.3 Calibration

remove the effects of the light source spectrum, fiber attenuation

subtract a background reading for every reflectance measurement.
The white surface provided ∼100% reflectance and
was used to compensate for the spectral shape of the light
emitted by the lamp and the wavelength-dependent sensitivity
of the detector and the optics in the detecting system. Calibration
spectra were routinely measured before data acquisition of the
brain by placing the probe at a fixed distance from the white
standard. It is quite usual and convenient to present the results

2.4 Reflectance Model
Numerous models based on the diffusion approximation of the
transport equation have been described in the literature over the
past few years.53–58In this study, we utilize the two-source diffusion
theory model derived by Farrell et al.,40 who calculate the

heatstroke lead to changes of the optical properties since they are

. For the
given geometry shown in Fig. 1 and fixed source-detector
separation, we use a tissue-like phantom with known optical
properties over the wavelength range of 600 to 1000 nm to determine
the values of k

will be demonstrated in the end of the next section.
2.5 Data Analysis
Prior to data analysis, the collected diffuse reflectance spectra,
^ R
d
, was preprocessed using the fspecial function in MatLab to:
1. remove spectral artifacts such as pulsations of the cortex due
to respiration and heartbeat, and 2. to eliminate high frequency
noise originated from the spectrometer. All spectra for a given
temperature were collected sequentially during single data
collection session. Data analysis was performed off-line using
in-house scripts written in MatLab. The spectral range of the
processed spectra was in the range of 650 to 1000 nm with
2-nm increments. Spectra derivatives conducted during this
study were performed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm
with respect to wavelength. Common statistics metrics such
as Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE), were computed
to assess the fitting ability between reference temperature and
the predicted data. These metrics were calculated based on

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2(a) shows the absorbance spectrum measured on a
representative mouse brain (mouse #1, Table 1) with three
different temperatures (32°C, 38°C, and 40°C) out of 10
measurements, conducted on the same animal, for easier visual
representation. In Fig.2(b)the region between 940 and 1000 nm
was magnified to emphasize the change in absorbance intensity
peak around 970 nm. In both panels, the effect of temperature on
the absorbance spectrum is clearly observed and the difference
between spectral intensities is noticeable. Based on the effect of
temperature on the absorbance measurements shown we assume
that both scattering and absorption alterations occur as a result
of chromophores and morphological changes. The dominant
feature is in the absorbance of water that peaks around
970 nm. As it can be seen, this peak decreased and shifts slightly
to a shorter wavelengths (left shift) as temperature rises. This
shift to a lower wavelength as the temperature increases resemble
the Wien’s displacement law.59 The intensity and shift
changes at 970 nm are attributed to the fact that an increase
in temperature results in a change of water absorptivity (and
concentration) as a result of weakening and reduction of hydrogen
bonds; water molecules absorb photon energy attributed to
the vibrational overtone of the O H bond around 970 nm.18,60
Therefore, the changes at this wavelength can be considered as a
qualitative indicator of water accumulation in the tissue and
therefore tissue and cellular edema during heatstroke injury.
It is important to note the change occurring in the spectral
shape of the absorbance to understand physiological changes
during heatstroke. Specifically, we are interested in several
wavelengths across the spectra that reflect tissue composition;
i.e., characteristic changes in tissue composition at particular
wavelengths could be indicative of chromophore behavior.
The absorption coefficient of oxyhemoglobin differs from
that of deoxyhemoglobin along most of the NIR spectrum.

However, at a certain isosbestic wavelength (∼800 nm), the
absorption curves cross each other and represent the same
value. Thus change in reflectance at an isosbestic wavelength
is affected mainly by blood volume (and hence, blood flow)
while a change in a non-isosbestic wavelength is affected by
the oxy-deoxy ratio as well. The absorbance around 650 nm
is mostly affected by the change in deoxyhemoglobin while
at 840 nm it is more affected by oxyhemoglobin. Therefore,
one can consider the difference between the measurements at
different wavelengths as a qualitative representation of the
blood oxygenation level. Changes in absorbance intensity spectra
confirm our hypothesis that heatstroke causes changes in the
optical properties of brain tissue with resultant morphological
damage and tissue composition changes. In order to highlight
spectral differences that result from an increase in temperature,
the spectral second derivative was calculated and is depicted in
Fig. 2(c). The spectral region between 700 and 800 nm, magnified
in Fig. 2(d), reflects the sensitivity to biochemical (specifically
hemoglobin) variations around the center of 760 nm.
The changes in absorbance around the isosbestic point
(800 nm) suggest that cerebral blood flow is affected following
induction of heatstroke. To evaluate the relationship between
spectra reflectance and second derivatives versus temperature
an exponential function were calculated and depicted in
Fig. 3. As can be seen, as the temperature increases the peak
reflectance at 970 nm decreases in an exponential fashion as
a result of increase in absorption while the peak of the second
derivative reflectance at 760 nm increases as a result of hemoglobin
variations. We conjecture that heat diffusion to the tissue
area may causes hemoglobin denaturation and thereby affect its
ability to bind oxygen although the temperature is relatively low.
The change in optical absorbance spectra of various hemoglobin
species with temperature was also noted in earlier reports.45,46
Figures 2 and 3 show a consistent pattern among the participant
animals throughout this study and confirm our hypothesis that
changes in NIR signals can reflect changes in internal temperature
in injured brain. Simultaneous measurements of the body
physiologic parameters were monitored during heatstroke concurrent
to spectral measurements. The variations in heart rate
and SpO
2
versus temperature are indicated by the plot in
Fig. 4. As shown, an increase in body temperature causes the
heart rate to increase and concurrently induce a decrease in oxygen
saturation until death. Please note that theSpO
2
is generally
above 90% because pulse oximeter measures the saturation of
full-oxygenated arterial blood. However, SpO
2
in Fig. 4 is quite
low (∼75%) even at normal temperature environment. We found
that in three mice, theSpO
2
was around 75% while the other two
were around 85%. This low SpO

. This is very difficult to precisely control in rodent
experimental settings.
As seen from Fig. 3, and as we observed along this study,
three factors are influenced by increase in temperature:
1. lower reflectance at∼970 nm accompanied by 2. a spectral
shift,Δλ, from the baseline temperature and 3. an increase in its
second derivative intensity at ∼760 nm. These variations
motivate us to define a following combined function coined
reflectance-temperature index (RTI), which summarizes these
significant elements of contrast in a single index. RTI defined
as
RTI ¼

d@970
×

Δλ
: ðdimensionlessÞ (5)
RTI become more sensitive to temperature elevation as its
numerator increase and the denominator strongly decrease
causing a total increase in RTI. To bring RTI into a universal
index (dimensionless) it was multiply by the average wavelength
, hλi. Since the peak wavelengths which we determine
the spectral shift,Δλ, are not sharp but broad [Fig. 2(b)] we calculate
the average wavelength, hλi, from the spectra band where
the maximum is. Specifically, to determine hλi, we scan all the
wavelength points where the maximum is and then we calculate
the average. For example, in Fig. 2 for the 38°C, we found the
maximum at the wavelet’s range of 978 to 982 nm.
Averaging these five wavelengths results in hλi¼ 980 nm. In 
continuation with Fig. 2, to determine the shift in wavelength
as temperature increases (Δλ) we found the maximum
absorbance around 970 nm for each temperature and then we
calculate the difference between. For example, in Fig.2the maxima
of the baseline temperature (32°C) found to be at 980 nm
while at 38°C it was found to be 970 nm which results in a
10-nm shift. From the entire study we found an average spectral
shift from the baseline ofΔλ ¼ 6.41.93 nm. The relationship
between RTI and temperature derived from Figs. 2 to 3 through
an exponential dependence of the form RTI ¼ a×exp
ðb · TempÞ is display in Fig. 5(a) for the above specific
mouse. The points on the graph represent the discrete RTI measurement
and the solid line represents the results of exponential
fit to this data. In Fig.5(b)a plot of RTI versus temperature data
for the entire experiments (n ¼ 5) is presented. The data in the
graph are the mean and the error bars refer to standard error of
positive and negative deviation separately, calculated over each
temperature. The solid curve in this figure is the exponential
fitting similar to what is shown in Fig. 5(a). As observed,
increased temperature leads to a measurable increase in RTI,
indicating the feasibility to follow temperature elevation in a
non-contact manner using the DRS method. The exponential
behavior we observed resembles the exponential increase of
intracranial pressure (ICP) during brain injury although further
study is necessary to determine the nature of the relationship.
The central nervous system is very sensitive to hyperthermia

nerves. The increase in absorbance at 760 nm (the dominant
chromophore being deoxyhemoglobin) with rising body temperature
can be explained by two phenomena. First, as a result
of cardiopulmonary compromise61 systemic oxygenation of
hemoglobin decreases (as evidenced by decreased oxygen
saturation on pulsoximetry in Fig. 4), second, hyperthermic
brain injury can result in increased ICP, consistent with previous
observations.62–67 It should be pointed out that no direct assessment
of brain function (or dysfunction) was conducted. However
, the changes in blood flow (800 nm absorption) provide
indirect evidence of altered brain physiology. Neurobehavioral
tests were not carried out during this experimental set up due to
the terminal (end-point being death) nature of the experiments
but can be studied in future nonterminal experiments.
As we show above, the relationship between RTI and temperature
can be derived through an exponential dependence of
the form RTI ¼ a×expðb · TempÞ. From this expression the
temperature can be extracted,

, we use Eq. (7) and temperature model prediction versus
actual temperature is presented in Fig. 6 for the new mouse. A
good correlation between prediction to actual temperature was
obtained with R ¼ 0.9. Inspection of the correlation plots also
reveals small RMSE and MRE, respectively. k in this experiment
was set to 5.75. The good agreement between the prediction
and actual temperature data implies that: 1. RTI can be a
candidate marker for temperature assessment during heatstroke
and 2. temperature can be monitored noninvasively using the
current DRS and Eq. (7). An important point to stress is that
Eq. (7) is an empiric mathematical expression and should be
studied in future works by increasing the number of animals
and comparison with direct brain temperature measurement
using conventional probes. This will be the next step in our
heatstroke research.
As mentioned previously, optical absorption and scattering
coefficients can be extracted with the use of the aforementioned

are known parameters we can find the absorption and
scattering coefficients by iterating of the both coefficients
until the calculated values of the reflection match the measured
ones (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm). It should be pointed out
that the increased temperature may affect absorption and
absorbance spectra differently since absorbance contains both
absorbing effects caused by the chemical components and the
scattering effects originated from the structural properties;
while the absorption only reflects the chemical absorbing effects
on light. The absorption and scattering behavior is illustrated in
Fig. 7 at two ranges of temperature; baseline (32°C) and heatstroke
(41°C) for the above representative mouse. The points on
the graph of Fig. 7(a) represent the discrete calculated absorption
coefficient at specific wavelengths and the solid line represents
the spline interpolation fit to this data. On the other hand,
in Fig.7(b), the points represents the discrete calculated reduced
scattering coefficient at specific wavelengths and the solid line
represents the power-law fit to this data. Several studies have
shown that the wavelength dependence of scattering in tissue
in the NIR obeys a power-law dependence of the form,68,69

A is the scattering amplitude which is related to the density of

temperature to heatstroke injury is clearly shown on both panels.
From the entire experiments the absorption at 970 and 980 nm

∼37%increase in cerebral tissue absorption following induction
of heatstroke. However, one should keep in mind that multiple
light scattering can obscure this temperature-water peak if
absorption is not separated from the scattering. The change
in absorption coefficient is influenced by variation in different
tissue biochemical composition such as oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin
(650 nm, 830 nm), fat (920 nm), and water (970 nm).

light attenuation by those chemical components within the
brain. On the other hand, analyzing the scattering power
show sp ¼ 1.410.6 at the baseline and sp ¼ 0.540.25 at
the heatstroke reflects more than a 60% decrease from the baseline.
The change in scattering is attributed to a change in the size
and number of scattering particles such as nuclei, mitochondria
and protein as well as change in refractive indices (sample inhomogenity
); increase in temperature causes severe morphological
damage to the tissue, such as denaturation of structural proteins
and tissue and cellular edema which in turn affect the scattering
properties and thus the light distribution. These morphological
changes can be deduced by the slope and amplitude of Fig.7(b).
As can be seen from Fig.7, while the fitting curve for absorption
data is good, the fitting curve for reduced scattering data is quite
difficult. This is because the fitting of the scattering is influence
greatly from the water peak around 970 nm. Therefore, if we
take out the last two wavelengths a better fitting can be achieved
as depicted in Fig. 7(c), although data points at 700 nm are far
off the curve (may be outliers). Ultimately, these eliminations do
not affect our results which show clearly decrease in sp (structural
changes). As we move from baseline temperature to heatstroke
condition the scattering slope becomes flat, reflecting the
increase in particle size or the evolution of swelling of the cells
and cell organelle in the brain. Decrease inAreflects the change
in the ratio of the refractive index outside (extracellular) to
inside (intracellular) the scattering particle. i.e., a drop in A
most likely reflects the fact that water changes increases the
inhomogeneity of refractive index and thus influence the scattering
amplitude. Since during heatstroke the morphological
damage in the brain tissue matrix occur which influenced the
A and sp parameters, they can therefore serve as a good marker
during heatstroke. Overall, changes in both optical properties
indicate variation of the pathophysiologic state of the brain
and the ability of our setup to follow alteration in temperature
during heatstroke over time. The observed change in optical
properties versus the temperature is consistent with previous studies
that demonstrate that absorption and scattering coefficients
can be temperature dependent.14,17–19,43,74
4 Conclusion
Heatstroke is an abnormally elevated body temperature with
accompanying physical symptoms including changes in the nervous
system function. In this work, for the first time to our
knowledge, we carried out experimental optical DRS on intact
mice brains to a. assess the changes in tissue optical and hemodynamics
properties that occurred during heatstroke, and b. to
predict internal temperature noninvasively. The measurements
were obtained with a single source-detector system orthogonal
to each other, and the model of light propagation was employed
to recover the optical property coefficients of cerebral tissue
from the experimental data. During heatstroke, we note that
the intensity peaks of the absorbance at 970 nm and in its second
derivative at 760 nm correlate well with increased temperature
through an exponential dependence. Reflectance-temperature
index (RTI) that reflects changes in reflectance intensity and
spectral shift from baseline was derived from DRS data. That
is, we used the difference in spectra properties through RTI
to estimate the influence of temperature on the internal rodent
brain tissue. Although our pilot measurements are preliminary,
results from a mouse show that RTI can be a good predictor for
temperature measurement (R ¼ 0.9). It should be pointed out
that the ability to determine the calibration factor k in Eq. (6)
is to have a complete dataset for calibration containing different
temperature levels expected to be encountered during routine
analysis. However, this can be accomplished during the calibration
process with a dataset that is well representative changes in
temperature conditions. Our future work will focus on further
testing of the system on more mice and the applicability of
Eq. (6) and applying appropriate calibration/validation modeling
such as partial-least square (PLS) regression.12 We also
report the change in cerebral optical properties, based on the
use of diffusion model, which reflects the variation in chromophores
content and brain structure during heatstroke. The
reported technique is simple, inexpensive, easy to implement,
and can therefore be adapted in the future for temperature monitoring
in clinical and laboratory settings as well.
