Disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), including stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain tumors,
are the world’s leading causes of disability. Delivery of drugs to the CNS is complicated by the blood–brain
barriers that protect the brain from the unregulated leakage and entry of substances, including proteins, from
the blood. Yet proteins represent one of the most promising classes of therapeutics for the treatment of CNS
diseases. Many strategies for overcoming these obstacles are in development, but the relatively straightforward
approach of bypassing these barriers through direct intrathecal administration has been largely overlooked.
Originally discounted because of its lack of usefulness for delivering small, lipid-soluble drugs to the brain, the
intrathecal route has emerged as a useful, in some cases perhaps the ideal, route of administration for certain
therapeutic protein and targeted disease combinations. Here, we review blood–brain barrier functions and cerebrospinalfluid dynamics and their relevance to drug delivery via the intrathecal route, discuss animal and human
studies that have investigated intrathecal delivery of protein therapeutics, and outline several characteristics of
protein therapeutics that can allow them to be successfully delivered intrathecally.

Health Organization, 2006). It is estimated that over 1 billion people
worldwide suffer from a neurological disorder, including brain tumors,

neuropathic pain (World Health Organization, 2006; Bray et al., 2012).
Effective treatment of most of these and other neurological conditions
may require the use of drugs with sites of action within the central
nervous system (CNS). However, the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a protector
of the CNS and a major regulator of its environment, impedes the
blood-to-brain entry of most potential therapeutics.
Strategies under investigation to overcome the problem of the BBB
can be roughly divided into two broad categories. The first category
comprises techniques that allow or facilitate the crossing of drugs
through the BBB (e.g. molecular Trojan horses, proton-coupled
oligopeptide transporters, exosomes,liposomes, nanoparticles, chimeric
peptides, prodrugs), while the second category consists of techniques
that bypass the BBB altogether via direct delivery to the CNS (Smith
et al., 2004; Alam et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012; Vlieghe
& Khrestchatisky, 2013). In the second category, several techniques
have been investigated, including BBB disruption, and intrathecal (IT),
intracerebroventricular(ICV), and intranasal delivery. This review focuses
specifically on IT delivery. Because promising reports for ICV and intranasal
delivery and BBB disruption have been extensively described
(Alam et al., 2010; Rajadhyaksha et al., 2011; Tayebati et al., 2013;
Zhao et al., 2013), we will not recapitulate them here. Instead, this
review is intended to re-examine the potential of IT drug delivery to
allow penetration of protein therapeutics to the brain parenchyma, a
role thathas been largely discounted in the past. We begin with a discussion
of endogenous BBB mechanisms and CNSfluidflow dynamics, then
examine current data demonstrating effective IT delivery of particular
classes of therapeutic proteins to the brain. We conclude with a consideration
of ideal molecules for IT delivery and promising future applicationsofthistechnology.
2. Barriers to the delivery of drugs
to the brain and cerebrospinalfluid
Drug delivery to the CNS is complicated by complex biological barriers
generally termed the blood–brain barriers, including the vascular
blood–brain barrier (BBB), blood–cerebrospinalfluid barrier, and specialty
barriers such as the blood–retinal barrier (Neuwelt et al., 2008).
These barriers serve many functions for their dependent tissue beds.
The most widely known function, especially for the vascular BBB, is
the prevention of the unregulated movement of substances from the
blood into the CNS. Generating and maintaining stable resting potentials
, action potentials, and synaptic transmission, together with the
massive spatial and temporal summation of nerve impulses necessary
for CNS function, requires an extreme degree of control over ionic,
protein, and neurotransmitter concentrations in CNS fluids. The BBB
thus affects and even regulates many of the complex interactions between
the peripheral tissues and the CNS that are mediated through the
blood stream, including neuroimmune interactions (Quan & Banks,
2007), feeding and energy balance (Banks, 2008), and even those affecting
cognition (Banks, 2012).
The simplest mechanism by which molecules can cross the BBB is
passive transmembrane diffusion. The degree to which a substance
can enter by this mechanism is dictated by its lipid solubility and molecular
weight, with small, lipid-soluble substances crossing more efficiently
than large, hydrophilic substances. Steroid hormones are good
examples of endogenous substances that can cross the BBB in this
manner (Banks, 2012). Most small molecule recreational drugs also
cross the BBB by this mechanism, including morphine, heroine, and
ethanol (Becker & Greig, 2010). Exploitation of passive transmembrane
diffusion in drug delivery has been hampered, however, by the presence
of CNS-to-blood (efflux) saturable transport systems (Begley, 2004).
Efflux transporters at the BBB serve critical functions, controlling electrolyte
levels and limiting CNS exposure to endogenous and exogenous
neurotoxins and to other endogenous biologics, including enkephalins
and immunoglobulin G molecules, but they complicate the delivery of
potential protein therapeutics to the CNS (Begley, 2004; Banks, 2005).
We have shown, for example, that efflux of the neurotrophic peptide,
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 27, limits it accumulation
in the brain and that inhibition of the efflux transporter allows intravenously
administered peptide to accumulate in the brain to therapeutic
levels (Dogrukol-Ak et al., 2009).
Influx transporters are also located at the BBB in large numbers, including
those for glucose, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, minerals,
electrolytes, nucleic acids, peptides, feeding hormones, immune cells,
and cytokines (Oldendorf, 1971; Davson & Segal, 1996; Engelhardt,
2008). Use of an influx transporter by a substance can increase its
brain uptake to 4- to 30-fold over what would be predicted from entry
via a passive transmembrane route (Oldendorf, 1971). A few drugs are
known to use endogenous, saturable influx transport systems to enter
the CNS, including L-dopa, donepezil, valproic acid, and gabapentin
(Pardridge, 2007). Utilizing influx transporters for drug delivery of
proteins is fraught with its own special difficulties, however. For example
, the proteins which transport certain ligands across the BBB are not
always the same proteins which act as receptors within the CNS (Pan &
Kastin, 1999). As such, a modification that enhances transport of an
endogenous ligand across the BBB can also have the unwanted effect
of reducing its binding affinity to its CNS receptor. Further, recombinant
proteins are unpredictably sensitive to being modified. Encapsulation,
alteration to the base sequence (fusion proteins), and slight changes
to glycosylation patterns can cause recombinant proteins to fold improperly
, lose stability, lose enzymatic activity, or become more immunogenic
(Jorgensen et al., 2006; Jorgensen & Nielson, 2009; Tan et al.,
2010).
Many drug delivery techniques are in development with the aim of
facilitating BBB crossing, as mentioned above, although a full discussion
of these is outside the scope of this review. A different strategy is direct
injection of protein therapeutics into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
in order to bypass the BBB altogether (Patel et al., 2009; Alam et al.,
2010; Rajadhyaksha et al., 2011). Administration into CSF is accomplished
by injection into the lateral ventricles of the brain (ICV administration
), the subarachnoid space at the level of the cisterna magna, or
the lumbar spine (IT administration). Direct CNS administrations have
been successfully employed in instances where a local effect of the
deliveredtherapeutic is desired, such asin pain management, treatment
of spasticity, and cancer chemotherapy. A larger extent of penetration
beyond the site of injection, which is needed to treat neurodegenerative
disease, is influenced primarily by theflow dynamics of the CSF.
3. Cerebrospinal and interstitialfluidflow
and dynamics: Implications for drug delivery
A thorough understanding of thefluidflow dynamics in the brain is
critical when considering the distribution patterns for protein drugs
administered directly into the CNS. In the body, interstitialfluid (ISF),
containing sugars, salts, lipids, amino acids, coenzymes, hormones,
and cellular waste products, bathes nearly every cell, including those
of the brain. ISFflow plays a key role in nutrient and waste transportation
, intercellular signaling, immune regulation, and the maintenance of
cellular homeostasis throughout the body. The regulation of both colloidal
osmotic pressure andfluid volume is dependent upon this efficient
removal of soluble proteins and waste products from the ISF (Scallan
et al., 2010; Wiig & Swartz, 2012).
Within the brain ventricles, a second CNSfluid, the CSF, is continuously
produced. The major direction of CSFflow is between the sites of
production in the choroid plexuses (Johanson, 1988) and the major
sites of reabsorption in the arachnoid villi and in the primitive lymphatic
system located at the cribriform plate (Knopf et al., 1995; Boulton et al.,
1999). The total volume of human CSF is about 150 mL, and the human
brain produces approximately 500 mL of CSF per day (Johanson et al.,
2008). It has been calculated that while the ISF is replaced relatively
slowly (every 20 hours), the rate of turnover of CSF is faster and dependent
on the size of the brain, with the mouse turning over its CSF

compartment every 1.87 hours and the human every 4.39 hours (Cserr
& Patlak, 1992; Davson & Segal, 1996; Begley et al., 2000; Johanson
et al., 2008; Begley, 2012).
Although somatic ISF drains into lymphatic vessels, such vessels are
notably lacking in the CNS, despite the fact that the intense metabolic
activity of neural tissue and its exquisite sensitivity to changes in the extracellular
environment would seem to demand an efficient lymphatic
vasculature. The absence of such vasculature led to early work whereby
the role of CSF, whichflows throughout the ventricular system in the
CNS, was clarified as critical to ISF solute clearance from the brain via
paravascular pathways (Rennels et al., 1990, 1985). Recent elegant
experiments in mice have expanded our understanding of CNS fluid
flow, with resulting implications for drug delivery (Begley, 2012; Iliff
et al., 2012). Iliff and colleagues investigated theflow of CSF into and
through the brain interstitium through a series of ex vivo and in vivo experiments
in mice using fluorescent tracers of different molecular
weights. In thefirst set of experiments, tracers of three different molecular
weights (759 Da, 3 kDa, and 2000 kDa) were infused into subarachnoid
space of anesthetized mice, from which point they entered the
brain along paravascular spaces (Iliff et al., 2012). The large 2000 kDa
tracer was confined to the paravascular spaces and did not enter the interstitial
space, but the 3 kDa tracer entered the interstitium from the
paravascular space and from the pial surface. The smallest tracer of
759 Da rapidly disseminated throughout the interstitial spaces of the
brain, leaving only a small amount in the paravascular spaces through
which it had entered. Building upon thesefindings, the investigators
used two-photon laser scanning microscopy through a closed cranial
window in anesthetized mice to conduct real-time imaging of the
movement of the same 3 kDa and 2000 kDa tracers after intracisternal
injection (Iliff et al., 2012). After injection, both of the tracers rapidly
entered the brain along the outside of cortical surface arteries and
penetrating arterioles. Movement from the paravascular spaces into
the interstitium occurred readily for the 3 kDa tracer, but the 2000
kDa tracer remained confined to the paravascular space. The movement
of the 3 kDa tracer into the interstitium was dependent on the
aquaporin-4 water channel localized in perivascular astrocytic endfeet,
and its movement was abolished in Aqp4-null mice.
Ex vivo techniqueswere then used to map the exit pathwayfrom the
brain of a 45 kDa tracer after intracisternal injection. After injection, the
45 kDa tracer moved rapidly inward along penetrating arteries and
arterioles to reach the terminal capillary beds throughout the brain. The
largest influxes were seen along large ventral perforating arteries of the
basal ganglia and thalamus. Exit from the brain appeared to occur along
both the medial internal cerebral veins and the lateral-ventral caudal
rhinal veins. Interestingly, tracer injected intraparenchymally into the
cortex, striatum, or thalamus was cleared along the same pathways.
The authors concluded that the ISF and CSF moving through the brain
parenchyma share the same paravenous drainage pathways. Because
the brain-widefluid transport that the authors observed in their series
of experiments is dependent upon astroglial waterflux, and because it
serves a lymphatic-like function in clearing solutes from the interstitial
space, the authors coined the term “glymphatic pathway” to describe
theirfindings (Iliff et al., 2012). This glymphatic pathway may help IT-
administered substances that reach the subarachnoid CSF to distribute
more deeply into the brain than would be predicted were penetration
to depend on diffusion only.
4. Direct delivery of protein therapeutics to the CNS
Early human studies of proteins administered by the ICV route found
that theywere rapidly cleared from the CSF and brain into the blood,
presumably failing to penetrate deeply into the brain parenchyma
(Greene et al., 1969; Ghersi-Egea et al., 1996). Some later studies were
similarly disappointing. For example, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor, a peptide that promotes survival of dopamine neurons, failed
to produce any improvements in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale scores when delivered into the ventricles of patients with advanced
Parkinson’s disease by an implanted catheter and access port
(Nutt et al., 2003). A later animal study investigatinginsulin-likegrowth
factor-1 for its potential neuroprotective effects in an Alzheimer’s
disease model was no more encouraging. After unilateral ICV injection
in the rat model, nearly all of the insulin-like growth factor-1 was cleared
from the brain by 1 hour after injection, and very little penetrated into
the parenchyma (Nagaraja et al., 2005).
Despite these well-known disappointing results, studies have documented
successful ICV or IT delivery of large protein therapeutics to the
brain parenchyma. One of thefirst examples of successful delivery in an
animal model was with leptin, which after lumbar IT administration
into the CSF of baboons and dogs was shown to reach the hypothalamus
and so influence feeding (LeBel et al., 1999; McCarthy et al., 2002). This
early work rekindled the interest in direct CNS administration of biologics
, which has since been shown in animal studies to be a potentially
viable therapeutic approach in several diseases, as discussed below.
4.1. IT Nogo-A Antibodies for Stroke
One factor affecting functional recovery after stroke is the neuriteoutgrowth
inhibitory environment present in the adult CNS. Proteins
such as Nogo-A appear to prevent fiber regeneration, sprouting, and
new network formation, contributing to the failure of CNS axons to
regrow and reconnect after injury (Pernet & Schwab, 2012). IT-
administered anti–Nogo-A antibody has been shown to penetrate into
the corpus callosum and the striatal white matter in rat models and
has resulted in improvements in measures of functional recovery (Tsai
et al., 2007). In a stroke model, macaque monkeys implanted with
osmotic pumps delivering anti–Nogo-A antibody to the IT and subdural
spaces showed recovery on theBrinkmanbox task, whichtests reaching
and grasping. Recovery ranged from 73% to 89.6% of pre-lesion levels in
treated animals, compared with below 50% recovery in the control
animals (Hamadjida et al., 2012). The treated animals, but not controls,
also exhibited an enhanced callosal connectivity with the ipsilesional
premotor cortex, based on normalized numbers of retrogradely labeled
neurons in the intact hemisphere.
4.2. IT enzyme replacement for neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases
The lysosomal storage diseases are inherited disorders characterized
by a deficiency in one or more specific lysosomal enzymes, resulting in
the accumulation of undigested or partially digested macromolecules
within cells and tissues (Winchester et al., 2000). Of the approximately
50 lysosomal storage diseases, two-thirds manifest neurological and
cognitive declines (Hemsley & Hopwood, 2009). Peripheral administration
of the missing enzyme can result in recovery of the peripheral
tissues, but it does little to reverse CNS manifestations of the disease.
Studies in animal models of several neuropathic lysosomal storage
disorders have demonstrated that IT or ICV administration of the missing
enzyme is feasible and potentially effective. Rodent studies are summarized
inTable 1. In general, these studies have found penetration of
recombinant enzyme into the brain parenchyma; in some cases localization
to the lysosomes of neuronal cells has been verified via coimmunostaining
with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 and
neuronal nuclear antigen. Significant reduction or normalization of
storage material levels in the brain as well as improvements in lifespan
or cognitive performance testing have also been seen. Probably of great
significance for the IT administration of lysosomal enzymes is the phenomenon
of cell uptake of the recombinant proteins by neurons and
glia, mediated by mannose-6-phosphate receptors or other uptake
mechanisms (Calias et al., 2012), thus effectively rescuing them from
the extracellularfluid and CSF and reducing the extent of clearance by
bulkflow.
Large animal studies of brain delivery of recombinant enzymes
have been conducted for several lysosomal diseases, including
116 P. Calias et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 144 (2014) 114–122
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-675582793)
mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, and III, late infantile neuronal ceroid
lipofuscinosis, and Niemann-Pick A disease (Table 2).AfterITorcisterna
magna administration, recombinant enzymes reached the hippocampus,
basal ganglia, thalamus, caudate, and periventricular white matter of
these large animals (Kakkis et al., 2004; Dickson et al., 2007; Hemsley
et al., 2009; Dierenfeld et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Crawley et al.,
2011; Vuillemenot et al., 2011; Calias et al., 2012; Dickson et al., 2012).
Penetration was dose dependent, and regions of the brain that are closest
to the CSF surface accumulated the highest enzyme levels. Detectable
enzymatic activity in various CNS cell types and improvements in neuropathology
have been reported in some of the large animal studies
(Kakkis et al., 2004; Dickson et al., 2007; Hemsley et al., 2009; Chen
et al., 2011; Crawley et al., 2011; Vuillemenot et al., 2011; Calias et al.,
2012; Dickson et al., 2012; Pfeifer et al., 2012). For example, enzymatic activity
was detected in neurons and glia in all six neuronal layers of the cerebral
cortex and in white matter oligodendrocytes in non-human
primates and beagles that received lumbar IT or ICV doses of iduronate-
2-sulfatase (the enzyme that is deficient in mucopolysaccharidosis II)
(Calias et al., 2012). Similarly, weekly intrathecal administration of recombinant
humanα-L-iduronidase to mucopolysaccharidosis I model
dogs revealed 2- to 5-fold elevated levels of enzyme in brain specimens
(Kakkis et al., 2004). Levels of pathologic glycosaminoglycan storage material
were normalized in the brains of these treated dogs, and neuronal
glycosaminoglycan storage was significantly reduced as seen on electron
microscopy. Although improvement in cognitive function and memory
has been suggested by murine studies (Table 1), only one study included
testing for cognitive improvement in a large animal model of lysosomal
storage disease; that study had a sample size of one treated animal
which developed an immune response to the administered protein, and
no improvement or stabilization of cognitive function was seen
(Vuillemenot et al., 2011).
Investigational use of IT treatment in a human patient has been
reported in a case study of a male patient with mucopolysaccharidosis
I-Scheie (Munoz-Rojas et al., 2008). At the age of 38 years, the patient,
while presenting with near-normal intellectual function, developed
unstable and progressive spinal cord compression with resulting gait
ataxia and lower extremity numbness, tingling, and pain. The patient
refused standard surgical treatment. He was treated with IT injections
of laronidase (Aldurazyme®, BioMarin Pharmaceutical/Genzyme
Corporation, Cambridge, Massachusetts) via lumbar puncture at 1-
month intervals for a total of 4 months. After 6 months, his 12-minute
walk test distance increased by 14%, pulmonary function parameters
improved between 18% and 56%, a consistent right ankle clonus disappeared
, and temperature sensation in the feet showed improvement.
Spinal canal stenosis remained stable on MRI. The patient reported
decreased numbness and tingling, increased stability when rising from
a chair and when walking, and decreased need for pain medication.
There was a reduction of 22.5% in CSF levels of glycosaminoglycan substrate
from baseline such that by month 4, the levels were normal.
Lysosomal enzymes may be particularly well suited for IT or ICV
delivery, as several viral vector studies have supported the idea that
lysosomal enzymes may undergo axonal transport, being transported
to and from a neuron cell body along microtubules through the cytoplasm
of axons. A similar transport throughout the brain may occur

via tanycytes and astrocytic processes (Begley, 2012). Such studies used
viral vectors that transduce cells only at the site of injection, but showed
detectable levels of enzyme activity and some correction of storage in
distal sites, including the contralateral hemisphere (Skorupa et al.,
1999; Bosch et al., 2000; Consiglio et al., 2001; Passini et al., 2002).
Passini et al. directly tested the axonal transport hypothesis by injection
of a viral vector expressing beta-glucuronidase, a lysosomal enzyme
that can be visualized in tissue sections, into mouse brain structures
that have defined axonal connections to other structures (Passini
et al., 2002). The authors found that after injection of the vector unilaterally
into the hippocampus of beta-glucuronidase–deficient mice, gene
expression was detected only at the site of injection, but cells were
strongly positive for beta-glucuronidase activity in both hemispheres
of the hippocampus and in the septum. Only regions with axonal
connections to the site of transduction were enzyme positive. Storage
lesions in the distal structures were also reversed, suggesting that the
enzyme was correctly targeted to the lysosomal compartment and
remained enzymatically active after transport.
IT andICV treatmentwithrecombinanthuman enzymes not surprisingly
can be associated with an inflammatory response. As noted above,
this may be related to the reabsorption of CSF by way of routes previously
discussed (Cserr & Knopf, 1992; Knopf et al., 1995). Homozygous
null animals, such as the mucopolysaccharidosis I canine model, show
variable accumulations of B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other lymphocytes
in the meninges of the spinal cord, areas of the spinal dura,
and around the brain (Kakkis et al., 2004). The inflammatory cells in
the meninges appeared more prominent in animals that were treated
with frequent doses or that developed immunoglobulin G antibodies
against the human protein (Dickson et al., 2007). Specific antibodies
were found in serum and CSF in these animals, and in dogs, cats
and monkeys receiving intra-CSF doses of other recombinant human
enzymes (Kakkis et al., 2004; Dickson et al., 2007; Hemsley et al.,
2009; Crawley et al., 2011; Felice et al., 2011; Vuillemenot et al., 2011;
Dickson et al., 2012; Pfeifer et al., 2012). Antibody formation may be
partly due to cross-species reactivity; however, titers in wild-type
animalswerelowerthanthoseseeninnullanimalmodels(Vuillemenot
et al., 2011). While in some cases the appearance of antibodies in the
serumandCSFcoincidedwiththedevelopmentofinfusion-relatedreactions
(Hemsley et al., 2009; Vuillemenot et al., 2011), the majority of
studies reported that no adverse effects were observed (Kakkis et al.,
2004;Dicksonetal.,2007;Crawleyetal.,2011;Feliceetal.,2011;Ziegler
etal.,2011;Dicksonetal.,2012;Pfeiferetal.,2012).Inthefuture,blocking

or by neonatal exposure to the enzymes (Vogleret al., 1999; Dierenfeld
et al., 2010; Crawley et al., 2011) might enhance the effectiveness of IT
delivery ofproteintherapeutics.
4.3. IT Trastuzumab for breast cancer brain metastases
About 5% to 6% of patients with breast cancer develop brain metastases
(Schouten et al., 2002; Schouten et al., 2002; Barnholtz-Sloan
et al., 2004) at which point survival is about 7 months (Altundag
et al., 2007). In about 40% of patients with CNS metastases, the tumors
are positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)
(Altundag et al., 2007). Trastuzumab, a humanized anti–HER-2 monoclonal
antibody, has beenshown in severallarge, prospective, controlled

studies to improve survival for patients with primary and metastatic
HER-2–positive breast cancer (Slamon et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2007)
andisusedaspartofthefirst-line treatment regimens in these populations.
Unfortunately, peripherally administered trastuzumab
does not reach therapeutic levels in the brain because of poor penetration
of the BBB (Stemmler et al., 2007). A number of case reports
documenting the use of IT delivery of trastuzumab in patients with
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis have suggested that this route of administration
is well tolerated (Table 3). IT trastuzumab improved
clinical status and neurological complaints, and the overall survival
appeared to be greater than what would be expected in this patient
population. The safety of IT trastuzumab was evaluated in a formal toxicology
study performed in cynomolgus monkeys. Animals received
weekly IT trastuzumab at doses of 0, 3, or 15 mg for four weeks, and no
drug-related effects on body weight, clinical signs, neurological function,
clinical pathology, or anatomic pathology were seen, even at CSF
concentrations that exceeded those reported in patients in the IT
case studies (Braen et al., 2010). Phase I/II trials in human patients
with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis are in progress (NCT01373710,
NCT01281696, NCT01645839, NCT01325207).
5. Drugs delivered by the intrathecal
route: Characteristics of the ideal molecule
The studies reviewed here illustrate that, contrary to traditional
dogma, some molecules administered by the IT route can exert therapeutic
effects on the CNS. The traditional view was based on and is
largely true for small, lipid-soluble molecules. The molecules that are
able to reach the CNS in therapeutic amounts after IT delivery tend to
share a number of characteristics. Ideal molecules are usually proteins
with little or no brain-to-blood passage at the level of the blood–brain
barriers and are relatively resistant to degradation by the enzymes
found within the CSF. Although the CSF has been shown to contain
hundreds of proteins (Bora et al., 2012; Holtta et al., 2012) and may
have a lower enzymatic activity than blood, enzymatic susceptibility
should be evaluated for each drug candidate individually during the development
process. Distribution to deep brain tissues after IT delivery
can also be aided by receptor mediated cellular uptake and intercellular
transfer. The lysosomal enzymes, for which some success in IT delivery
has been reported, are examples of protein drugs with these characteristics.
Without such intracellular and intercellular distributions, another
characteristic of the ideal molecule would be a site of action within
diffusible distance of a CSF-contacting area or accessed by the deep
subarachnoid circulation recently described by Iliff and colleagues (Iliff
et al., 2012). Another advantage of IT delivery of a protein therapeutic
with a high therapeutic index is that the drug may be able to treat not
only the neurological but also the peripheral symptoms of the disease.
Inmost cases, CNSdelivery results inthedrugenteringtheblood stream
as the CSF is reabsorbed.
There are also several disadvantages of IT delivery of therapeutic
proteins. One is the development of antibodies that tend to reduce the
effectiveness of the drugs. Another is that it may be difficult to predict
the percent of an IT dose of a drug that will reach the brain and cranial
CSF space; this may be caused by the variations in rates of CSF and
metabolic free water production and reabsorption. Chronic IT delivery
would be easier to achieve with the placement of indwelling catheters
rather than repeated lumbar punctures; however, treatment would
then be dependent on reliable catheter placement and stability. Some
disease conditions may complicate catheter placement or stability,
such as obesity or rapid growth rates in children (Follett et al., 2003).
Infection is a risk that must be managed as well, with rates of infection
with implanted IT catheters reported to be between 4% and 9% (Du Pen,
2005; Holmfred et al., 2006; Aprili et al., 2009; Taira et al., 2013; Motta &
Antonello, 2014). Thus, even in the best of circumstances, catheters
require periodic replacement.
6. Conclusions
Whereas early experiences with small, lipid-soluble molecules
resulted in the IT route for drug administration being discounted, new
evidence demonstrates that IT delivery may be an ideal route of administration
for large biomolecules. Numerous studies in small and large
animal models of stroke and the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage
diseases show that IT delivery of protein therapeutics can result in
widespread penetration into the brain parenchyma, improved signs of
neuropathology, and improved clinical and behavioral outcomes.
Tolerability to treatment was generally good in these studies.
Similarly, case reports and studies in human patients with a neurodegenerative
lysosomal storage disease or breast cancer metastases
to the CNS have suggested generally acceptable tolerability
and therapeutic effectiveness with few adverse events after the IT
delivery of enzymes or antibodies. A number of clinical trials of
IT-administered protein therapeutics are underway for patients
with mucopolysaccharidosis I (NCT00638547, NCT00852358),
mucopolysaccharidosis II (NCT00920647, NCT01506141) and
mucopolysaccharidosis III (NCT01155778, NCT01299727);
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (NCT01373710, NCT01281696,
NCT01645839, NCT01325207) and intraventricular hemorrhage
(NCT01810302). It is anticipated that results from these trials will
help guide clinical implementation of IT drug delivery on a larger
scale and will inform therapeutic efforts for a variety of neurological
disorders.
