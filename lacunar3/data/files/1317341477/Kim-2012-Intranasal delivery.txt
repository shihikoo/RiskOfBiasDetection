Noninvasive intranasal drug administration has been 
noted to allow direct delivery of drugs to the brain. In 
the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery was investigated 
in the postischemic rat brain. Fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC)-labeled control siRNA was delivered intranasally 
in normal adult rats using e-PAM-R, a biodegradable 
PAMAM dendrimer, as gene carrier. Florescence-tagged 
siRNA was found in the cytoplasm and processes of neurons
and of glial cells in many brain regions, including the 
hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, and striatum, 
in 1 hour after infusion, and the FITC-fluorescence was 
continuously detected for at least 12 hours. When siRNA 
for high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which functions
as an endogenous danger molecule and aggravates 
inflammation, was delivered intranasally, the target gene 
was significantly depleted in many brain regions, including
the prefrontal cortex and striatum. More importantly
, intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA markedly 
suppressed infarct volume in the postischemic rat brain 
(maximal reduction to 42.8 ± 5.6% at 48 hours after 
60 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)) 
and this protective effect was manifested by recoveries 
from neurological and behavioral deficits. These results 
indicate that the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA 
offers an efficient means of gene knockdown-mediated 
therapy in the ischemic brain.

INTRODUCTION
Drug delivery to the brain is needed to treat diseases of the central
nervous system, but delivery efficiencies are limited by the 
blood-brain barrier, which separates brain tissues from the systemic
circulating system and central interstitial fluid. In particular
, the blood-brain barrier effectively prevents the passages of 
hydrophilic and large molecular weight drugs. Accordingly, many 
different methods of administrating pharmacologic drugs have 
been devised to circumvent this barrier and achieve therapeutic 
or diagnostic benefits.
The intranasal delivery route is not obstructed by the bloodbrain
barrier, and thus, allows the direct delivery of drugs to the 
central nervous system.1 In addition, this direct route between the 
nasal cavity and the brain also circumvents drug elimination by 
the liver and gastrointestinal tract, filtration through the kidney, 
and degradation in serum. Moreover, the nose-brain route offers 
enhanced patient compliance for drugs administered via a parenteral
route. Direct deliveries of various proteins, for example, 
insulin,2–4 insulin-like growth factor,5,6 nerve growth factor,7,8
and cholecystokinin,9 have been reported. In fact, the intranasal 
method has been proposed for direct delivery of insulin to the 
brain to treat Alzheimer’s disease.2 Improvements in memory and 
cognition have been reported in Alzheimer’s patients who were 
received insulin intranasally.10,11 Recently, Doyle et al. (2008)12
reported that the nasal administration of osteopontin peptide
mimetics confers neuroprotection in rat stroke model, and 
Hashizume et al. (2008)13 found that the intranasal delivery of 
an oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor suppresses brain tumor 
growth and increased survival in rats. In addition, Danielyan et al.
(2009)14 reported the intranasal deliveries of mesenchymal stem 
cells and glioma cells to the rat brain.
In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential
of intranasal small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery in a 
rat model of focal cerebral ischemia using high mobility group 
box 1 (HMGB1) as a target gene. HMGB1 functions as an endogenous
danger signaling molecule,15 which is released by necrotic 
cells into the extracellular milieu and is also actively secreted by 
macrophages and monocytes to induce inflammation. 16–19 In a 
previous report, we showed that HMGB1 is massively released 
during excitotoxicity-induced acute damaging process in the 
postischemic brain, and that its release then aggravates brain 
damage by, for example, inducing microglia activation and apoptotic
neuronal death.20,21 In addition, we also found that HMGB1 
knockdown by intraparenchymally-administered siRNA significantly
reduces infarct volumes, thus confirming the crucial role 
played by HMGB1 in the postischemic brain.20,21 The purpose of 
this study was to examine the efficiency of intranasal delivery of

siRNA to various brain regions, to investigate target gene knockdown
efficiency in those regions, and to evaluate the therapeutic 
potential of intranasally delivered HMGB1 siRNA in the postischemic
rat brain.
RESULTS
Localization of siRNA in the rat brain after intranasal 
delivery
The efficiency of intranasal siRNA delivery was examined in 
normal rat brain by triple fluorescent labeling using fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled control siRNA, cell-type specific 
immunostaining, and DAPI staining (Figure 1c). FITC-labeled 
transfection control siRNA was delivered using e-PAM-R as a gene 
carrier. e-PAM-R is a biodegradable PAMAM dendrimer, which 
shows maximum siRNA delivery efficiency at weight ratio of 5.0 
(e-PAM-R/siRNA) in primary cortical neuronal cultures and in 
the postischemic rat brain.21 When we examined zeta potentials 
of polymer/siRNA complexes at weight ratios of 1.2, 2.5, 5.0 and 
10.0, the zeta potential increased with increasing weight ratios 
(Supplementary Figure S1), wherein 22.3 mV was obtained at 
weight ratio 5.0. In addition, the particle size was decreased to 
188.7 ± 1.9 nm at weight ratio: 5.0 (n = 3), which was remarkably 
smaller than 367.7 ± 40.4 nm of polymer without siRNA (n = 3, 
P < 0.01). These results indicated that e-PAM-R/siRNA complex 
at weight ratio: 5.0 was efficiently condensed and might be able to 
penetrate into the cells. We used 2 μg of HMGB1 siRNA/e-PAM-R  
complexes at weight ratio of 5.0 for all the experiments unless 
indicated otherwise.

Neuroprotection via the Intranasal HMGB1 siRNA
At 1 hour after intranasal delivery, FITC-labeled cells were 
found in the frontal cortex (pre-motor cortex) (Ct; Figure 1b) 
at the level indicated in Figure 1a. The FITC-label was localized 
in the cytoplasm of NeuN- or DAPI-positive cells (Figure 1d). 
The number of FITC-labeled cells was maintained at 3 and 12 
hours after delivery, though intensities appeared to be increased 
(Figure 1e,f). Triple labeling with FITC-labeled control siRNA, 
DAPI, and anti-GFAP or anti-Iba-1 antibody revealed that 
siRNA was also delivered to astrocytes (Figure 1h) or microglia
(Figure 1j), respectively. Similarly, FITC-labeled cells were 
found in other brain regions, including striatum (St; Figure 1k,n), 
amygdala (Am; basolateral and central nuclei) (Figure 1l–o), 
and hypothalamus (Hy; ventro-medial nucleus) (Figure 1m,p). 
FITC-fluorescence was detected mainly in cytoplasm, but it was 
also observed in neuritic processes in all brain regions examined 
(insets in Figure 1d–f, n–p). In contrast, animals administered 
e-PAM-R alone showed hardly any FITC-fluorescence in the brain 
at any time point examined (data not shown).
HMGB1 knockdown by intranasal siRNA delivery in 
the olfactory bulb
HMGB1 siRNA (2 μg)/e-PAM-R or nonspecific siRNA (2 μg)/
e-PAM-R complexes were delivered intranasally and HMGB1 
expression levels in the olfactory bulb (Figure 2a–c) were examined
by double immunohistochemical analysis using anti-HMGB1 
and anti-NeuN (a neuronal marker) antibodies. In normal brain, 
HMGB1 was present in almost all NeuN-positive cells and also in 
some NeuN-negative cells (Figure 2d), demonstrating that HMGB1 
is expressed in neurons and probably in glial cells. Three hours after 
HMGB1 siRNA delivery, HMGB1 immunoreactivity was decreased 
in mitral cells and also in cells located in the inferior surface of the 
olfactory bulb (Figure 2e) compared to that in controls (Figure 2d), 
and this decrease was maintained at 12 hours after HMGB1 siRNA 
delivery (Figure 2f). Similar levels of decrease were observed in the 
medial and superior surfaces (data not shown). However, in animals 
administered nonspecific siRNA/e-PAM-R, HMGB1 expression 
was detected in the nuclei of all NeuN-positive cells in the olfactory 
bulb (Figure 2g). Furthermore, in those animals, no visible change 
in cell morphology was observed (Figure 2g), thus alleviating concerns
regarding the possible toxic effects of e-PAM-R. These results 
indicate that the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA effectively 
downregulate HMGB1 expression in the olfactory bulb, the brain 
region adjacent olfactory epithelium.
HMGB1 knockdown by intranasal siRNA delivery in 
the amygdala and hypothalamus
Next, we examined the efficiency and temporal profile of target 
gene knockdown obtained by intranasal HMGB1 siRNA in the 
amygdala and hypothalamus (brain regions associated with the 
olfactory pathway) (indicated in Figure 1a,b). HMGB1 siRNA 
(2 μg)/e-PAM-R or nonspecific siRNA/e-PAM-R complexes were 
delivered intranasally. In normal brain, almost all NeuN-positive 
cells in the amygdala were HMGB1-positive (Figure 3a). However, 
3 hours after the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA/e-PAM-R, 
HMGB1-negative/NeuN-positive cells were detected (Figure 3b,n: 
n = 6, P < 0.05), and the number of these cells was further increased 
at 12 hours postdelivery (Figure 3c,n: n = 6, P < 0.01). Although, 
the percentage of HMGB1-positive cells recovered at 24 hours 
postdelivery (Figure 3d,n: n = 6), our results indicated that the 
intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA effectively depletes HMGB1 
expression in the amygdala. In addition to neurons, HMGB1 
knockdown was also observed in astrocytes (Figure 3f). In the 
hypothalamus, HMGB1-positive cells were similarly reduced after 
siRNA administration (Figure 3h,n: n = 6, P < 0.01). In contrast, 
HMGB1 suppression did not occur in nonspecific siRNA-treated

animals both in the amygdala (Figure 3e,g,n: n = 4) and in the 
hypothalamus (Figure 3i,n: n = 4). These results indicate that 
intranasally administered siRNA/e-PAM-R allows access to the 
central nervous system, at least to brain regions along the olfactory
pathway.
Knockdown of HMGB1 expression in the superior 
prefrontal cortex and striatum by intranasal siRNA
We next examined whether intranasal HMGB1 siRNA causes target
gene knockdown in brain regions other than those associated 
with the olfactory nerve pathway, such as, prefrontal cortex and 
striatum (as indicated in Figure 1b,c). Three hours after HMGB1-
siRNA/ePAM-R treatment, HMGB1 knockdown was evident in 
the superior prefrontal cortex (Figure 3j), and HMGB1-positive 
cell percentages were at 56.3 (n = 6, P < 0.01), 58.1 (n = 6, P < 
0.01), and 62.5% (n = 6, P < 0.01) at 3, 12, and 24-hours postdelivery
, respectively (Figure 3o). In the striatum (lateral), HMGB1-
positive cell percentages were reduced to 77.8% (n = 6) and 69.7% 
(n = 6, P < 0.01) at 3 and 12 hours postdelivery, respectively 
(Figure 3l,o). These results demonstrate robust HMGB1 knockdown
in the superior prefrontal cortex in a protracted manner. 
Furthermore, HMGB1 depletion was also detected in other parts 
of the brain, for examples, in pons and hippocampus, but levels of 
depletion varied (data not shown).
Marked reductions in the levels of HMGB1 protein 
and RNA in the superior prefrontal cortex and 
striatum by intranasal siRNA
HMGB1 knockdown in the frontal cortex and striatum by intranasal
HMGB1 siRNA was further confirmed by immunoblot 
 analysis and real-time PCR. HMGB1 siRNA/e-PAM-R or nonspecific
siRNA/e-PAM-R complexes were delivered intranasally 
and protein samples were purified from the regions indicated 
in Figure 4a, which included the area subjected to immunohistochemical
analysis in the previous section. It was found that the 
HMGB1 protein level was significantly decreased in the frontal

cortex at 3 hours after siRNA administration ( n = 6, P < 0.01) 
(Figure 4b), and further decreased at 12 hours postadministration
(n = 6, P < 0.01) and then maintained until 24 hours (n = 6, 
P < 0.01) (Figure 4b). In striatum, HMGB1 protein levels were 
also reduced at 3 hours postdelivery (n = 6, P < 0.05), and further 
decreased at 12 hours (n = 6, P < 0.01) and then maintained at 24 
hours (n = 6, P < 0.01) (Figure 4c). On the other hand, α-tubulin 
levels were unchanged both in cortex and striatum at all time 
points examined (n = 6) (Figure 4b,c). Notable reductions in 
HMGB1 RNA were also observed by real-time PCR analysis in 
both cortex (n = 4, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) (Figure 4d) and striatum
(n = 4, P < 0.01) (Figure 4e), supporting the immunoblot 
analysis results. However, in nonspecific siRNA-administered animals
, neither HMGB1 nor α-tubulin levels were changed (n = 4) 
(Figure 4b–e). These results corroborate the notion that intranasal
siRNA delivery provides a highly efficient means of achieving 
target gene knockdown in various brain regions.
HMGB1 reduction was not detectable in peripheral 
tissues
In contrast to the brain, HMGB1 reduction was not detectable in 
various peripheral tissues, such as, lung, liver, kidney, and heart, at 
12 hours after intranasal siRNA delivery ( Figure 5a,b). In particular
, changes in the HMGB1 levels were not detected in the lung, 
an organ directly connected with nasal cavity through pharynx 
and upper and lower respiratory passages. In addition, no morphological
differences were detected in those peripheral tissues 
(Figure 5c), suggesting that intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA 
does not cause any detrimental effects to these tissues, at least at 
this level.
Suppression of infarct formation by intranasal 
HMGB1 siRNA in the postischemic brain
The superior and lateral prefrontal cortices and striatum are supplied
by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Knockdown of HMGB1 
in the prefrontal cortex and striatum by intranasal siRNA (Figures 
3 and 4) prompted us to investigate the potential beneficial effects 
of this delivery method on animal models of MCA occlusion 
(MCAO), a focal cerebral ischemia model. Various amounts of 
HMGB1 siRNA were complexed with e-PAM-R at weight ratio 
of 1:5 and administered intranasally at 12 hours prior to MCAO 
(Figure 6b). TTC staining revealed that the administrations of 2 
or 5 μg of HMGB1 siRNA/e-PAM-R suppressed infarct volumes to 
47.9 ± 5.4% (n = 4, P < 0.01) and 52.8 ± 3.6% (n = 4, P < 0.01),

respectively, of that of the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated 
MCAO control (Figure 6b,c). When we examined infarct suppression
efficacy of HMGB1 siRNA (2 μg)/e-PAM-R complexes 
at various weight ratios (2.5, 5, or 10), complex with weight ratio 
5 showed a maximum infarct reduction (Supplementary Figure S2). 
Significant infarct volume suppression was evident when HMGB1 
siRNA (2 μg)/e-PAM-R complexes (weight ratio 5) were administered
at 24, 12, or 3 hours pre-MCAO or at 1, 3, or 6 hours post-
MCAO (Figure 6a), with maximal reduction to 42.8 ± 5.6% (n = 6, 
P < 0.01) at 1-hour post-treatment (Figure 6d–f). It is notable 
here that HMGB1 siRNA administration at 6 hours post-MCAO 
significantly reduced infarct volume to 73.8 ± 7.2% of that of the 
PBS-treated MCAO control (n = 5, P < 0.05) (Figure 6d,e). The 
administration of naked siRNA was also found to confer protective
effects, but its efficiency was significantly lower than that of 
siRNA/e-PAM-R (Figure 6d–f). However, the administration of 
nonspecific siRNA even at 12 hours pre-MCAO had no suppressive 
effect on infarct formation ( Figure 6d,e). We also confirmed that 
pH, PaO
2
, PaCO
2
, and blood glucose levels were similar in HMGB1 
siRNA-treated and untreated animals, which demonstrated that 
physiological parameters were not influenced by intranasal siRNA 
delivery (Table 1).
Intranasal delivery of HMGB1-siRNA improved 
neurological deficits in rats that underwent MCAO
Next, we examined the beneficial effects of intranasal HMGB1-
siRNA delivery on ischemic brains using behavioral tests. When 
HMGB1 siRNA was administered at 3 hours pre- or 1 hour post-
MCAO, mean modified Neurological Severity Scores at 2 day 
post-MCAO were 6.8 ± 0.9 (n = 8, P < 0.01) and 7.2 ± 1.1 (n = 8, 
P < 0.01), respectively, which were significantly lower than that 
of rats in the PBS-treated MCAO group (12.3 ± 0.5) (n = 9, P < 
0.01) (Figure 7a). Motor activities were assessed using the rotarod
test at 5 rpm and the mean time spent on the rota-rod by PBS-
treated MCAO control animals at 2 days post-MCAO was 65.3 ± 
16.4 seconds (n = 9) (Figure 7b), whereas for animals treated with 
HMGB1 siRNA intranasally, rota-rod performance was markedly 
improved (171.0 ± 12.8 and 165.0 ± 11.9 seconds) (n = 8, P < 0.01) 
(Figure 7b). Furthermore, these HMGB1 siRNA-treated animals 
had higher rota-rod scores than PBS-treated MCAO controls at 10 
and 15 rpm (with an hour interval between tests) (Figure 7c,d). 
Together these results show that intranasal HMGB1-siRNA/e-
PAM-R has neuroprotective effects on the postischemic brain, 
which were manifested by improvements in motor impairments 
and neurological deficits.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates the successful delivery of siRNA 
and subsequent target gene knockdown in various brain regions, 
that is, in cerebral cortex, striatum, amygdala, and hypothalamus.
Furthermore, the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA was 
found to markedly reduce infarct volumes and alleviate neurological
and behavioral deficits in the postischemic rat brain. It has 
been reported that intranasally administered insulin-like growth

factor-I reduced infarction volume and recovered behavioral 
defects in a rat MCAO model.5 In addition, intranasally delivered 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been reported to protect 
brain from ischemic insult via modulating local inflammation in 
rats.22 Similarly, protective effect of intranasal delivery of ginsenoside
Rb1 has been reported in stroke animal model.23 Recently, 
Doyle et al. (2008)12 reported that intranasal administration of 
osteopontin peptide confers neuroprotection in a rat MCAO 
model. The present study adds siRNA to the growing list of neuroprotectants
delivered intranasally to stroke animal model and 
provides the first report of marked alleviation of ischemic damage 
by intranasally delivered siRNA.
In terms of therapeutic potencies, intranasal delivery appears 
to be superior to intraparenchymal delivery in several important 
respects. In our previous report, we showed that the maximum 
reduction of infarct volume was by 34% by intraparenchymal

Neuroprotection via the Intranasal HMGB1 siRNA
siRNA administration, which was obtained by injecting 500 ng 
of HMGB1 siRNA into the cortex penumbra 18 hours before 
MCAO.21 However, in the present study we found that although 
2 μg of HMGB1 siRNA was administered, infarct volumes were 
reduced by 57.2 % by intranasal delivery 1 hour after MCAO 
(Figure 6d–f). Considering the administration time, intranasal 
delivery conferred greater benefit in our stroke model, because 
the therapeutic window was extended to 6 hours post-treatment 
(Figure 6d–f), which was far delayed from 24 and 12 hours prior 
to MCAO for intraparenchymal injection.21 The greater protection 
afforded by intranasal delivery might be explained by the fact that 
intranasally administered siRNA seems to be delivered within an 
hour and distributed widely in the brain (Figure 1). In particular, 
the remarkable HMGB1 depletion (Figures 3 and 4) and infarct 
volume reduction (by 64.8%; Figure 6e) observed in the cerebral 
cortex demonstrated that cerebral cortex could be the greatest beneficiary
of intranasal administration. Therefore, it would appear 
that intranasal drug delivery could be particularly beneficial for 
cortex-related diseases, such as, Alzheimer’s disease.2,10,11,24,25 In 
addition to the knowledge regarding the routes to different brain 
regions, additional study is required to determine whether target 
gene depletion differences are due to intrinsic cellular differences 
in different brain regions.
The persistency of target gene knockdown observed in the 
present study was also notable (from 3 to 24 hours post-siRNA 
delivery), and was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblot
analysis, and real-time PCR (Figures 3 and 4). The protracted
effect of intranasal siRNA delivery was also corroborated 
by the protective effect observed when animals were treated at 
24 hours prior to MCAO (Figure 6d,e). These effects might be 
attributed to multiple routes for intranasally delivered siRNA. 
Initially it has been reported that intranasal delivery occurs 
within minutes along the olfactory and trigeminal nerves.6,26,27
Then, fast transport via cerebrospinal fluid and subsequent slow 
delivery via intracellular transport and even simple diffusion have 
been reported as extracellular routes.28 Danielyan et al. (2009)14
claimed that in addition to the migration path involving the olfactory
bulb to other parts of the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid route 
is operative at least for the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells. 
They claimed that intranasally delivered mesenchymal stem cells 
were present in cerebrospinal fluid and that they migrated along 
the surface of the cortex and into brain parenchyma. In addition 
to these routes, a perivascular cell trafficking route has also been 
suggested for olfactory bulb neuroblast migration.29 In the present
study, the efficient knockdown of HMGB1 in various brain 
regions at 3 hrs after intranasal siRNA delivery ( Figures 2–4) 
and the significant improvements observed in pathological and 
neurological symptoms when administered at 1 hr post-MCAO 
(Figures 6 and 7) suggests that HMGB1 siRNA is dispersed via a 
route that accesses many different brain regions quickly, which in 
turn suggests that this route might involve the cerebrospinal fluid 
and vascular system.
We cannot exclude the possibility that persistent effect might 
be due, at least in part, to e-PAM-R, which is a biodegradable 
polycationic PAMAM ester, in which arginine is ester bound to 
PAMAM-OH functionalized dendrimer,30,31. e-PAM-R has been 
reported to be gradually degraded under physiological conditions
(pH 7.4, 37 °C), for example, Nam et al. (2009)30 found that 
more than 50% of the grafted amino acids were hydrolyzed within 
5 hours, and that this degradation caused a slow and protracted 
release of HMGB1 siRNA. It is interesting to note that neither 
siRNA/e-PAM-R complex nor naked siRNA exerts neuroprotective 
effects when delivered intravenously ( Supplementary Figure S3),  
suggesting that they cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier

Neuroprotection via the Intranasal HMGB1 siRNA
and that the effects observed in the present study might be due to 
direct nose to brain delivery.
Since the proportions of intranasally administered drugs 
transported to the brain are minimal,32 various strategies have 
been examined to improve delivery efficiencies. The application of 
drugs encapsulated into particulate vectors, like synthetic nanoparticles
, to olfactory epithelium could potentially improve central 
nervous system delivery. In addition, hyaluronidase pretreatment 
has been reported to improve intranasal delivery efficiencies. 14,33
Furthermore, Cardoso et al. (2007 and 2008)34,35 reported that 
siRNA delivery efficiency is enhanced by conjugating siRNA with 
targeting moieties, such as, transferrin-associated liposome and 
transferrin-associated lipoplex, which were found to enhance 
delivery to neuronal cells and the brain, respectively. On the other 
hand, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of e-PAM-R 
as a delivery carrier for siRNA. It is evident that formulational 
modifications and possible systemic side effects of nasal delivery 
require future study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (The Orient, Seongnam, South Korea) 
were used throughout, and randomly assigned to HMGB1 siRNA-delivered 
experimental group and nonspecific siRNA-delivered or vehicle (PBS)-
treated control groups. At the start of the experiment, animals weighed 
280–320 g (10 weeks old) were housed separately under a 12:12 hours light: 
dark cycle with free access to food and water.
Preparation of the siRNA/e-PAM-R complex. HMGB1 siRNA 
(ON-TARGETPplus SMARTpool siRNA DH-2081024, accession No. 
NM_012963; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), FITC-labeled transfection indicator
siRNA (siGLO Green Transfection Indicator D-001630, Dharmacon), 
and nonspecific siRNA (on-TARGET plus non-targeting pool D-001810, 
Dharmacon) were complexed with e-PAM-R using 2 μg of siRNA in 
Opti-MEM (20 μl, e-PAM-R/siRNA weight ratio 5.0), and then incubated 
for 30 minutes at room temperature before intranasal administration. 
Production procedure for e-PAM-R was described in previous reports.21,30
The ζ-potential and the size of the dendrimers/siRNA complexes were 
measured using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000 HAs (Malvern Instruments, 
Worcestershire, UK) using PCS 1.61 software. About 1 ml of polyplex 
solutions at various weight ratios was prepared to a final concentration of 
2 μg/ml siRNA in HBSS (10 mmol/l HEPES, 1 mmol/l NaCl, pH 7.4).
Intranasal siRNA delivery. All animal experiments were carried out in 
accordance with “The Guidelines for Animal Research” issued by Inha 
University School of Medicine. Rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular
ketamine/xylazine hydrochloride injection (3:1) (100–150 μl/100 g 
body weight). Body temperatures were maintained at 37 °C using a heating 
pad. The animals were randomly divided into three groups; animals in the 
first group were administered HMGB1 siRNA, those in the second group 
were administered nonspecific siRNA, and animals in the third group were 
administered vehicle (PBS). The nasal administration procedure was carried
out generally as previously described by Thorne et al. (2004),6 but with 
significantly larger drop size. Briefly, a nose drop containing siRNA suspension
(2 μg/20 μl) or PBS (20 μl) was carefully placed on one nostril of 
an anesthetized animal (supine 90° angle) using a sterile 26-G Hamilton 
microsyringe (80330; Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) and allowed to be 
delivered to the nasal cavity. Then the rest of the suspension was administered
similarly in an alternating manner with a 2-minute interval between 
applications.
Surgical procedures for MCAO. MCAO was carried out as previously 
described.20 In brief, male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–320 g) were initially 
anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in a 30% oxygen/70% nitrous oxide gas 
mixture, and anesthesia was maintained using 0.5% isoflurane in the same 
gas mixture throughout the procedure. Occlusion of the MCA was maintained
for 1 hour using a nylon suture, and this was followed by reperfusion.
The left femoral artery was cannulated during the procedure to 
obtain blood samples and to monitor pH, PaO
2
, PaCO
2
, and blood glucose 
concentration (I-STAT; Sensor Devices, Waukesha, WI). Regional cerebral 
blood flow was monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter (Periflux System 
5000; Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden), and a thermo-regulated heating pad and 
heating lamp were used to maintain a rectal temperature of 37 ± 0.5 °C. 
Animals were randomly divided into three treatment groups: untreated 
MCAO control, HMGB1 siRNA-treated MCAO group, and nonspecific 
siRNA-treated MCAO group. For HMGB1 siRNA-treated MCAO group, 
HMGB1 siRNA was intranasally administered 24, 12, or 3 hours prior to 
or 1, 3, or 6 hours post-MCAO. TTC staining and behavior studies were 
conducted at 2 days post-MCAO. Animals allocated to the sham group 
underwent an identical procedure with the exception of MCAO.
Infarct volume assessments. Rats were decapitated at 2 days post-MCAO, 
and whole brains were dissected coronally into 2-mm brain slices using 
a metallic brain matrix (RBM-40000; ASI, Springville, UT). Slices were 
immediately stained by immersion in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37 °C for 15 minutes and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
The areas of infarcted regions in cortex and striatum were measured 
using the Scion Image program (Frederick, MD). To account for cerebral 
edema and differential shrinkage resulting from tissue processing, areas of 
ischemic lesions were determined by subtracting areas in ipsilateral hemispheres
from those of contralateral hemispheres. Infarct volumes were calculated
(in mm3) by multiplying summed section infarct areas by section 
thickness.
Modified neurological deficit severity scores. Neurological deficits were 
evaluated using modified Neurological Severity Scores at 2 days post-
MCAO. The modified Neurological Severity Scores system consists of 
motor, sensory, balance, and reflex tests, all of which are graded using a 
scale of 0–18 (normal: 0, maximal deficit: 18). 36 Motor scores were determined
by summing the results of two tests. The first involved suspending 
a rat by its tail and allocating scores of zero or one to each of the following; 
flexion of forelimbs, flexion of hindlimbs, and head movement by >10 ° 
with respect to the vertical axis within 30 seconds. The second test involved 
placing a rat on the floor and allocating scores as follows; 0 for normal 
walking, 1 for an inability to walk straight, 2 for circling toward the paretic 
side, and 3 for falling on the paretic side. Sensory tests included a placing 
test (score 0–1) and a proprioceptive test (score 0–1). A beam balance test 
was used to test balance and scores of zero to six were allocated as follows; 
0 for balance with a steady posture, 1 for grasping the side of the beam, 2 
for hugging the beam with one limb off the beam, 3 for hugging the beam 
with two limbs off the beam or spun on the beam for over 60 seconds, 4 
for attempting to balance on the beam but falling off within 40 seconds, to 
60 seconds, 5 for attempted to balance on the beam but falling off within 
20 seconds, and 60 seconds for making no attempt to balance or hang on 
to the beam. Reflex test scores were determined by awarding scores to the 
following four items (total score 0–4): pinna reflex, 0–1; corneal reflex, 0–1; 
startle reflex, 0–1; and seizures, myoclonus or myodystony, 0–1.
Rota-rod test. Twenty-four hours before MCAO, rats were conditioned on 
a rota-rod unit at a constant 3 rpm until they were able to remain on the 
rotating spindle for 180 seconds. Two days post-MCAO, each rat was subjected
to rota-rod testing at 5 rpm, and residence times on the rota-rod at 
10 and 15 rpm were measured with an inter-trial interval of 1 hour.
Immunohistochemistry. Normal animals were randomly divided into 
three groups and administered with PBS, HMGB1 siRNA, or nonspecific 
siRNA. After 3, 12, or 24 hours after the administration, they were subjected
to double immunohistochemistry. Animals were sacrificed after

being anesthetized. Brains were isolated and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
by transcardial perfusion and post-fixed in the same solution 
overnight at 4 °C. Coronal brain sections (20 μm) were prepared using a 
vibratome (Leica, Solms, Germany), and immunological staining was 
performed using a previously described floating method. 37 The following
primary antibodies were diluted 1:500; anti-HMGB1 (ab18956-100; 
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-Neu N (MAB377; Chemicon, Temecula, 
CA), anti-GFAP (556327, BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and anti-
Iba-1 (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG 
(Jackson ImmunoRes Lab, West Grove, PA) was used as a secondary antibody
for anti-HMGB1. After washing stained sections with PBS containing 
0.1% Triton X-100, sections were incubated with Rhodamine-conjugated 
anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoRes Lab) for anti-Neu N, anti-GFAP, or 
anti-Iba-1 antibodies in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. After 
rinsing three times for 10 minutes in PBS, the sections were incubated 
with the nuclear marker DAPI (4a-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate) 
(D3571, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 minutes at room temperature, 
washed three times with PBS, and then observed under a confocal imaging
system (Radiance 200; Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). The representative
pictures were presented and quantification results were presented as 
percentages of the number of HMGB1-positive cells in NeuN-positive cells 
counted in 10 randomly selected regions (230 μm x 230 μm, indicated in 
Figure 1b) in 4–6 independent experiments.
Real-time PCR. Normal animals were randomly divided into three groups: 
they were administered with PBS, HMGB1 siRNA, or nonspecific siRNA. 
After 3, 12, or 24 hours after the administration, brain tissues were prepared 
from indicated areas in Figure 4a and total RNA was purified from with 
TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer
’s instructions. RNA from each group was treated with DNase 1 to avoid 
genomic contamination. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Takara 
RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 
1 μg of total RNA. PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 
10 μl of 2x iQ SYBR Green supermix (Takara Bio), 1 μl each of 5 pmol/μl forward
and reverse primers, and 5 μl of cDNA (1/100 dilution) using the Mini-
Opticon Real-Time PCR System Detector (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). PCR 
was performed using: 5 minutes at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds
at 95 °C, 30 seconds at 57 °C, and 30 seconds at 72 °C. The annealing 
temperature was increased to 60 °C for HMGB1 amplification. Specificity 
of amplification was determined by DNA melting curve analysis using the 
built-in software for automatic fluorescence data captured during temperature
increments (0.5 °C) from 55 °C to 95 °C. Differences in amplification 
fold were calculated based on real-time PCR amplification of the target gene 
versus GAPDH (reference) using the built-in Gene Expression Analysis 
software in an iCycler iQ Real-Time RCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The 
following primers sets were used; 5a-GGCTGACAAGGCTCGTTATG-3a 
and 5a-GGGCGGTACTCAGAACAGAA-3a for HMGB1; 5a-TCATTGAC 
CTCAACTACATGGT-3a and 5a-CTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAG-3a for 
GAPDH. Real-Time PCR was performed four times per group for each 
brain region (cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and amygdale).
Cresyl violet staining. For cresyl violet staining, normal rat brains were 
embedded in paraffin using a standard procedure. Sections (8 μm) were 
then cut coronally using a microtome at the level of the dorsal hippocampus
and stained with 1% cresyl violet.
H&E staining. HMGB1 siRNA (2 μg) or nonspecific siRNA was administered
intranasally to normal rats. At 24 hours after siRNA administration
, rats were deeply anesthetized and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
by transcardial perfusion. Liver, lung, heart, and kidney were removed 
quickly and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. The 
organs were embedded in paraffin using a standard procedure. Tissues sections
were cut 8 μm thick, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and dehydrated
in ethanol. The slides were cleared using xylene and mounted with 
cover slips.
Immunoblotting. Normal animals were randomly divided into three 
groups: they were administered with PBS, HMGB1 siRNA, or nonspecific 
siRNA. After 3, 12, or 24 hours after the administration, brain homogenates
were prepared from indicated areas in Figure 4a and immunoblotted 
as described previously.20 Primary antibodies for anti-HMGB1 (2600-1; 
Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) and anti-α-tubulin (Calbiochem, San Diego, 
CA) were diluted 1:1000 and detected using a chemiluminescence kit 
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary 
antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance
followed by the Newman–Keuls test. All data are presented as averages
± SEMs and statistical significance was accepted at the 5% level.
