Astrocytes appear to be important regulators of the inflammatory events that occur in stroke. Sulfiredoxin-
1 (Srxn1), an endogenous antioxidant protein, exhibits neuroprotective effects. Although the mechanism
by which Srxn1 negatively regulates oxidative and apoptotic pathways has been extensively characterized
, the impact of Srxn1 on inflammation has not been well studied. In this study, we used oxygenglucose
deprivation followed by recovery (OGD/R) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic stress from
cerebral ischemic damage on primary cultured astrocytes. We found that knockdown of Srxn1 by two
shRNAs resulted in decreased cell viability of astrocytes. Decreased level of Srxn1 also correlated with
excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6. In
addition, Srxn1 appeared to influence the strength of TLR4 signaling pathway; the expression of COX-2,
IL-6, and NOS2 were strongly induced by OGD/R and H2O2in astrocyte cultures with Srxn1-shRNAs. Our
results suggested that loss of Srxn1 expression in astrocytes may cause excessive activation of inflammatory
responses which contribute to OGD/R- and H2O2-induced cell death. Restoring Srxn1 function
by gene therapy and/or pharmacology emerges as a promising strategy for the treatment of stroke and
other chronic neurodegenerative diseases.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and results in severe
long-term disability in many countries. Both in ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke, the primary insult elicits an inflammatory response
that contributes to secondary brain damage. Although many antiinflammatory
approaches have been investigated in animal models,
none of these has demonstrated protective efficacy in stroke patients.
The focus of these approaches on neuronal-specific
mechanisms might be one of the reasons for failure (Barreto et al.,
2011). There is now compelling evidence that astrocytes not only
influence the immune and inflammatory events that occur in stroke,
but also regulate neuronal and microglial inflammatory responses
(Kim et al., 2010; Sofroniew, 2014). Thus precisely controlling the
duration and extent of the inflammatory responses by astrocytes
could be a good strategy in reducing brain damage and improving
recovery.
Sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1), conserved in eukaryotes, is an endogenous
antioxidant protein. It has been suggested to be a potential
therapeutic agent for several diseases, including brain disorder
(Findlay et al., 2005). Induction of Srxn1 expression contributes to
neuroprotective ischemic preconditioning in response to oxygenglucose
deprivation in vitroand following a brief ischemic episode
in vivo(Bell et al., 2011). Our previous study showed that Srxn1 can
protect PC12 cells from H
2
O
2
-induced oxidative stress and is involved
in Prdxs activity (Li et al., 2013). Srxn1 catalyzes the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-dependent reduction of the hyperoxidized sulfonic
acid inactive form of 2-Cys peroxiredoxin PrxSO2/3 into sulfonic
PrxSOH (Lowther and Haynes, 2011; Soriano et al., 2008, 2009).
It also has a role in the reduction of glutathionylation, a posttranslational
oxidative modification that occurs on numerous
proteins in Parkinson’s disease (Findlay et al., 2005). Baek et al.
(2012) reported that Srxn1-depleted cells show an activation of
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways, including mitochondria
membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release, and caspase
activation. Each of these characteristics of Srxn1 theoretically

represents protective mechanisms. However, which of these mechanisms
accounts for protection by Srxn1 remains unclear. Recently,
Srxn1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of redox
homeostasis in macrophages and other inflammatory mediators
(Abbas et al., 2011). There is genetic evidence showing that Srxn1
affects the expression of cytokines, chemokines, interleukins, and
various inflammatory genes in Srxn1 null mice (Planson et al., 2011).
Thus Srxn1 may influence host response to inflammation.
Astrocytes are more resistant to focal cerebral ischemia than
neurons. Interestingly, although the baseline level of Srxn1 showed
no difference between astrocytes and neurons, the level of Srxn1
when induced is much higher in astrocyte cultures than in neuron
cultures (Bell et al., 2011; Gürer et al., 2009; Soriano et al., 2008).
These biochemical findings suggest an important role for Srxn1 in
reactive astrocytes, which we examined in this study using astrocyterich
primary cultures. We propose that loss of Srxn1 expression in
astrocytes may cause excessive inflammatory responses and thereby
contribute to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by recovery (OGD/
R)- and hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O

)-induced cell death.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Astrocyte-rich primary cultures
Primary cultures were prepared in compliance with animal
welfare regulations of the current international laws. The animal
protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Chongqing Medical University, China. All efforts were
made to minimize suffering. Astrocyte-rich primary cultures were
prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats born 1 to 2 days as described
elsewhere (Park et al., 2009). Briefly, cortices were dissociated into
a cell suspension using trypsin digestion and then plated into a dish
containing modified Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM;
Gibco, New York, NY, USA)/glucose/10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
culture media. After incubating the cells in culture for 2–3 weeks,
microglia were detached from flasks by mild shaking. The remaining
adherent astrocytes were detached with trypsin/EDTA, and the
recovered cells were plated on dishes. The cell types in the astrocyteenriched
cultures were identified via staining for glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) (WuHan Boshide Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Wuhan,
China). More than 95% of the cultured cells were GFAP-positive.
2.2. shRNA-mediated gene silencing
Lentiviral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were
prepared by Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The four RNA
sequences used based on the rat Srxn1 (Gene ID: NM_001047858)
gene were: 5-GCTACAGAGAGAGACCATTCC-3 (Lenti-Srxn1-sh1),
5-CATCGACGTCCTCTGGATCAA-3 (Lenti-Srxn1-sh2), 5-CGTGCCAA
TCGCCGTGCTCAT-3 (Lenti-Srxn1-sh3), and 5-CATCCACACCAGA
CTTGCAGT-3 (Lenti-Srxn1-sh4). Nontargeting shRNA (Scramble
shRNA group) was used as a negative control. To infect astrocytes,
the virus was thawed on ice, mixed with growth medium, and added
to astrocyte cultures. At the optimized concentration of virus, we
observed no evidence of toxicity and approximately 80% transduction
efficiency. shRNA efficiency was verified by Western-blot and
real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR). 72 h after infection, primary
astrocytes were used for all experiments.
2.3. OGD/R
In the OGD/R experiment, primary cortical astrocytes were
washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.2) then transferred
into glucose-free DMEM solution (Gibco). The cells were then
placed in a hypoxic incubator (Forma model 3131, Thermo Scientific
, Marietta, OH, USA) that was flushed with a mixture of 94%
N
2
-1% O
2
-5% CO
2
. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
2
for
re-oxygenation (reperfusion, R).
2.4. H

-induced cell injury
For H
2
O
2
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) treatment, astrocytes
were first washed with FBS-free DMEM. H
2
O
2
(50, 100, 250, and
500 μM solution final) was added directly to the medium of growing
cells. The culture plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5%
CO
2
atmosphere for an additional 6 h.
2.5. Cell viability
Cell viability was examined by observing the ability of the cells
in culture to reduce yellow colored 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma Aldrich) to purple
colored formazan, as described previously (Yu et al., 2013). Briefly,
1 mg/ml MTT reagent was added to each well and incubated for 4 h
at 37 °C. The media were carefully removed, and 150 μL DMSO was
added to each well. The absorbance of the resulting formazan solution
was recorded with a Microplate Spectrophotometer reader
(Bio-Rad, California, USA). For the trypan blue assays, floating and
attached cells were collected and cell death was measured by the
uptake of trypan blue (Sigma Aldrich) into cells that had lost
membrane integrity.
2.6. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) measurement of
TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6
The supernatant of cell culture was collected. TNF-α and MPO
levels were measured using commercially available ELISA commercial
kits (USCN Life Science, Wuhan, China), following manufacturer’s
instruction. The signal was read at 450 nm immediately using a
microplate reader. IL-1β and IL-6 protein levels were determined with
ELISA kits from WuHan Boshide Biotechnology Co, Ltd. The enzyme
reaction was stopped with TMB, and absorbance was measured at
450 nm. The resulting values were expressed in pg/ml.
2.7. PCR arrays
Genomic DNA content differences of each group were determined
by using the quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) method as previously
described (Carrión et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2012). The sequences of probes
and primers used were as follows for Srxn1: forward, 5′-CCCAAG
GCGGTGACTACTAC-3′, reverse, 5′-GGCAGGAATGGTCTCTCTCTGTA-3′;
TLR4: forward, 5′-GAATGAGGACTGGGTGAGAAAC-3′, reverse, 5′-
ACCAACGGCTCTGGATAAAGT-3′. Amplification of β-actin was done for
each experimental sample as endogenous control to account for differences
in the amount and quality of total RNA added to each reaction.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed in the iCycler
iQTM Multicolor Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) by SYBR green
I dye detection. Data were analyzed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager Software.
2.8. Western blot analysis
Proteins were collected in lysis buffer at the indicated times.
Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures and
the following antibodies: anti-Srxn1 (1:400 dilution, Proteintech,
Wuhan, China); anti-COX-2 and anti-IL-6 (1:500 dilution, Bioworld
Technology, Minneapolis, MN, USA); anti-NOS2 (1:500 dilution,
Boshide Biochemical Corporation); anti-TLR4 (1:2000 dilution,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Immunopositive bands were scanned
using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Bands were normalized
against β-actin using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), and the fold
change was calculated using the mean value of fold changes from
three replicates.

2.9. Statistical analysis
The results are presented as mean ±S.E.M. For multiple group
comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a oneway
ANOVA on ranks was used followed by a multiple comparison
Holm–Sidak, Dunn’s, or Student–Newman–Keuls test. All the analyses
were performed with PASW statistics software, version 17.0
(SPSS). Values of P <0.05 were considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Knockdown of Srxn1 in astrocyte-rich primary cultures
To ascertain whether the Srxn1 mRNA and protein level is reduced
in astrocytes upon exposure of cells to siRNA to Srxn1, q-PCR and
western blotting were used.Fig. 1Ashows q-PCR data for Srxn1 mRNA
level in the following experimental groups: Control, Scramble shRNA,
Lenti-Srxn1-sh1, Lenti-Srxn1-sh2, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3, and Lenti-Srxn1-
sh4. Compared with the Control shRNA group, considerable reduction
in Srxn1 is observed in both Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 group and Lenti-Srxn1-
sh4 groups (P <0.05). Lenti-Srxn1-sh1 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh2 did not
significantly affect Srxn1 level. Western blotting results (Fig. 1B)demonstrated
that Srxn1 expression level was significantly attenuated in
astrocytes transduced with Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 (P <0.01) or Lenti-Srxn1-
sh4 (P <0.05) compared to the Scramble group, but no difference in
Srxn1 expression was detected among the following experimental
groups: Control shRNA, Scramble shRNA, Lenti-Srxn1-sh1, and Lenti-
Srxn1-sh2 (P >0.05). Under oxidative stimulated astrocytes, the Srxn1
mRNA and protein level was increased (Fig. 1C,D). Furthermore, the decrease
in the Srxn1 mRNA and protein level in the Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and
Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 groups was also observed after OGD/R and H
2
O
2
treatment
(Fig. 1E–H). The extent of reduction in the Srxn1 mRNA level was
greater than that in the Srxn1 protein level, but this might be due to
post-transcriptional mechanisms that have been described previously
(Li et al., 2013). Therefore, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-
sh4 were selected as the shRNA construct for subsequent experiments.
3.2. Knockdown of Srxn1 decrease cell viability
As shown inFig. 2A, under normal conditions, cell viability did
not differ between Control and Scramble shRNA group (P >0.05).
However, cell viability was reduced approximately 20% in Srxn1
knockdown groups (both Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4
groups). Astrocytes were subjected to OGD for different time periods
ranging from 2 to 8 h immediately afterwards, cell viability was
tested by MTT assay. In agreement with previous works (Benavides
et al., 2005), OGD applied for periods shorter than 4 h does not have
deleterious effects for astrocyte survival (Fig. 2C). Having determined
that OGD6h/R24h caused about 40% of the astrocytes to die,
this duration was used for all further experiments. We next determined
cell viability after knockdown of Srxn1 (Fig. 2D). The Srxn1
knockdown cultures showed a significant reduction in the number
of cells following the transfection of the shRNA (both Lenti-Srxn1-
sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 groups). Next, a set of experimental MTT
results showed that astrocytes with H
2
O
2
treatment resulted in a
concentration-dependent loss of cell viability (Fig. 2F). We observed
that the cell death resulting from the 100 μM H
2
O
2
treatment
was the same as that from the OGD/R treatment in our experiments
(nearly 40%). Then, we chose 100 μM H
2
O
2
for subsequent
experiments. Knockdown of Srxn1 also decreased cell viability in
H
2
O
2
-treated primary cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2G). Further quantification
indicated that the total number of viable cells dropped
to 48.69 ±2.46% and 52.68 ±2.06% in the Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-
Srxn1-sh4 groups, respectively (Fig. 2G). In parallel, the extent of
cell death was significantly increased after knockdown of Srxn1 as
reflected by the percent of trypan blue-positive cells (Fig. 2B, E, H),
implying that Srxn1 regulates cell survival.
3.3. Knockdown of Srxn1 increases the secretion of TNF-α, MPO, IL-
1β,and IL-6 from primary astrocyte cells
To examine the inflammatory responses that occur after knockdown
of Srxn1 in vitro, neuroinflammation was induced under
normal conditions, OGD/R or H
2
O
2
. As shown in Fig. 3A–D, under
normal conditions, compared with the Scramble group, the levels
of TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β and IL-6 were increased in the Lenti-Srxn1-
sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 groups. As shown in Fig. 3E–H, OGD
significantly enhanced the levels of TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β and IL-6 by
9.52-fold (Fig. 3E, P <0.01), 2.99-fold (Fig. 3F, P <0.01), 7.66-fold
(Fig. 3G, P <0.01), and 10.06-fold (Fig. 3H, P <0.01), respectively, as
compared to the Scramble group. There was no significant increase
in the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the Scramble
shRNA group, while a significant increase in TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and
IL-6 levels was observed when the cells were transfected with Lenti-
Srxn1-sh3 or Lenti-Srxn1-sh4, as compared with the Scramble plus
OGD/R group (P <0.01 or P <0.05). Furthermore, when treated with
100 μM H
2
O
2
for 6 h, cells in the Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-
sh4 groups showed a significantly increase in TNF-α level, from
469.57 ± 21.77(pg/ml) in the Scramble plus H
2
O
2
group to
583.61 ±9.48 (pg/ml) (P <0.01) and 576.85 ±23.23 (pg/ml) (P <0.01),
respectively (Fig. 4I). Similar results were obtained from the MPO,
IL-1β, and IL-6 ELISA assay in the Srxn1 shRNA treated groups
(Fig. 3J–L). Compared with the Scramble plusH
2
O
2
group, the levels
of MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6 were increased by 1.5-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.3-
fold, respectively, in the Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 groups.
3.4. Knockdown of Srxn1 upregulates the expression of TLR4, COX-2,
IL-6, and NOS2 in primary astrocyte cells
We next investigated changes in the protein expression of
molecules involved in the intracellular TLR4 signaling pathways in
astrocytes under different conditions. Compared with the Scramble
group, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 increased the basal
levels of mRNA and protein expression of TLR4 (Fig. 4A and B).
As shown in Fig. 4C and E, compared with the Control plus OGD
(or H
2
O
2
) group, Scramble shRNA had no effect on the expression
level of TLR4, while Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 markedly
increased the mRNA expression of TLR4 (P <0.01 or P <0.05),
consistent with the Western blot result (Fig. 4D and F). The western
blot results and quantification of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2 levels are
shown inFig. 5. Under normal conditions, an increase in COX-2, IL-
6, and NOS2 levels was observed when the cells were transfected
with Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 or Lenti-Srxn1-sh4, as compared with the
Scramble group (Fig. 5A–D). As shown in Fig. 5E–H, the expression
levels of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2 in the OGD model group
increased by 19-fold (P <0.05), 1.8-fold (P =0.01), and 7.77-fold
(P <0.01), respectively, relative to the Scramble group, whereas, compared
with the Scramble plus OGD group, Srxn1 shRNA caused a
significant increase in the protein levels of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2.
Similar results were obtained with H
2
O
2
treatment (Fig. 5I–L).
4. Discussion
Inflammation occurs in this necrotic brain tissue, following the
breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and infiltration of blood
immune cells. Post-ischemic inflammation is an essential step in
the delayed phase of ischemic injury. Recently, studies have shown
that some small molecules may play an important role in brain inflammation
(Shichita et al., 2012a, 2012b). Our present data suggest
that Srxn1, an endogenous small protein, may cause excessive astrocyte
inflammatory responses and thereby contribute to OGD/R

-induced cell death. We observed excessive proinflammatory
cytokine and chemokine production (such as TNF-α,
MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6) in astrocytes upon knockdown of Srxn1. In
addition, Srxn1 is essential for controlling the strength of TLR4 signaling.
The expression of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2 was strongly induced
by OGD/R and H
2
O
2
in Srxn1-shRNA astrocyte cultures. Thus, loss
of Srxn1 may not only reduce the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic
defense capabilities of neurons but also impair the key regulator
of potentially neurotoxic proinflammatory responses.
Srxn1 is ubiquitously expressed at modest levels in neurons and
astrocytes, as well as in mixed hippocampal cultures (Bell et al., 2011;
Gürer et al., 2009; Soriano et al., 2008). Consistent with other reports,
our preliminary experiments show that the baseline level of Srxn1
seems to be the same between newborn rat neurons and astrocytes.
However, Srxn1 immunoreactivity becomes very strong in
reactive astrocytes (nearly two-fold than in neurons) under H
2
O
2
conditions (data not shown). We observed that knockdown of Srxn1
caused deregulated inflammatory responses in astrocytes, at least
upon exposure to OGD/R and H
2
O
2
injury.
Cellular injury followed by ischemic reperfusion is a complex
pathophysiological event associated with significant impairment of
multiple vascular and cellular responses. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and in particular H
2
O
2
have been considered to be endogenous
danger signals in cerebral disease (Gaire et al., 2013; Shi et al.,
2012). OGD/R and H
2
O
2
could mimic tissue ischemia, in that exposure
to such injury results in the production of highly reactive
hydroxyl radicals, and excessive levels of glutamate and inflammatory
cytokines (Gaire et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2011).
We used OGD/R and H
2
O
2
as injury stimuli to model ischemia in
vitroin order to determine the exact molecular mechanism by which
Srxn1 regulates in astrocytes. Proinflammatory cytokines and
enzymes TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6 impart inflammatory and antiinflammatory
processes in stroke (Chen et al., 2012; Minami et al.,
2006). In this study, we observed that Srxn1 knockdown led to increases
in the secretion of TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and IL-6 from primary
astrocytes. These results further suggested that Srxn1 protects
primary cultured astrocytes from ischemia-induced damage through
its anti-inflammatory action.
TLR4 is pivotal in triggering the inflammation of sterile organs
(Chen et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007). Many damage-associated molecular
pattern molecules (DAMPs) are well known as endogenous
TLR ligands: high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), heat shock proteins
(HSPs), and β-amyloid (Aβ) (Marsh et al., 2009; Rivest, 2009;
Shichita et al., 2012b). It could also induce expression of some major
neuroinflammatory components: COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2, which
enhance cerebrovascular permeability and exaggerate inflammatory
progression (Lehnardt et al., 2003; Waak et al., 2009). Previous
data suggest that the TLR4-induced neuroinflammatory response
after stroke mainly depends on astrocytic and microglial expression
of TLR4 (Bowman et al., 2003; Caso et al., 2007; Waak et al.,
2009). We believe that Srxn1 regulates the TLR4 pathway. In our
present study, we observed that Srxn1 knockdown in astrocyte cultures
significantly sensitizes cells to OGD/R or H

injury. Under
these conditions, both the RNA and protein level of TLR4 expression
can be induced by Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4.Planson
et al. (2011)observed that loss of Srxn1 in mice affects sepsis through

altered TLR4 signaling via Perioxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2). Prdx2 has been
shown to exert a negative control on LPS-TLR4 signaling by regulating
the level of ROS produced by NADPH oxidases (Planson et al.,
2011); this is consistent with our previous observation that Srxn1
knockdown results in decreased expression levels of Prdx2 and Prdx-
SO3 Protein (Li et al., 2013).
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Srxn1 regulates astrocyte
neuroinflammation by controlling TNF-α, MPO, IL-1β, and
IL-6 levels. Loss of Srxn1 may contribute to neuroinflammation by
upregulation of TLR4, leading to the formation of excessive, potentially
neurotoxic levels of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2. In combination
with other treatment strategies, such as thrombolysis or targeting
early events in the ischemic cascade, small-molecular-based therapies
may increase our chances to forestall the relentless progression
of ischemic damage. Restoring Srxn1 function by gene therapy and/
or pharmacology means emerges as a formidable strategy for the
treatment of stroke and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases.
We will continue to investigate this with further in vivostudies
Fig. 4. Srxn1 knockdown upregulated the expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein level in astrocytes under different conditions. Under normal conditions, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3
and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 increased the mRNA (A) and protein expression (B) of TLR4. Under OGD/R conditions, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 markedly increased the
mRNA (C) and protein expression (D) of TLR4. After H2O2treatment, Lenti-Srxn1-sh3 and Lenti-Srxn1-sh4 markedly increased the mRNA (E) and protein (F) expression of
TLR4. Values are expressed as mean ±S.E.M., n =3, ## P <0.01 vs. Scramble; # P <0.05 vs. Scramble; ** P <0.01 vs. Scramble plusOGD/R;△ P <0.01 vs. Scramble plusH2O2;
