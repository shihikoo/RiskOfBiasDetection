Abstract It is remarkable that migraine is a prominent
part of the phenotype of several genetic vasculopathies
affecting small cerebral vessels, including cerebral autosomal
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
leukoencephalopathy, retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy and hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal
arteriolar tortuosity and leucoencephalopathy. Moreover
, several studies have reported an association between
migraine and white matter lesions or clinically silent
infarct-like abnormalities in the posterior circulation. In
this review, we focus on genetic vasculopathies associated
with migraine and speculate about the pathophysiological
mechanism that can explain this comorbidity.

Introduction
The classical vascular theory that migraine aura is primarily
caused by vasoconstriction and migraine headache
by vasodilatation is too simplicistic [1]. Part of the current
theory is that migraine aura results from cortical spreading
depression (CSD) which is a short lasting depolarization of
neuronal and glial cell membranes spreading over cortex
[2]. Activation of the trigeminovascular system (TGVS)
plays a role in migraine headache, leading to the release of
vasoactive neuropeptides (CGRP, substance P, NO), which
are believed to cause neurogenic inflammation, central pain
transmission and headache [2]. In this theory, vasodilatation
of cerebral and meningeal vessel is considered a secondary
phenomenon that may occur after activation of
TGVS. Recent studies, however, have casted considerable
doubt about the role of vasodilatation in migraine. For
instance, CGRP antagonists do not have a vasoconstrictive
effect, but are very effective in the treatment of migraine
[3]. In addition, a study using a sensitive 3 Tesla MRA-
technique, failed to show in vivo cerebral and meningeal
vasodilatation in humans during migraine headache [4].
Nevertheless, this study does not rule out a role for small
cerebral vessels. This is relevant because small cerebral
vessels are involved in blood flow changes that occur
during CSD. Functional neuroimaging studies [5] have
shown that the blood flow changes consisted of an initial
hyperemia during depolarisation of neuronal and glial
membranes, followed by a reduction of cerebral blood flow
during hyperpolarization and suppression of neuronal and
glial membranes. Changes in blood flow are considered to
follow the virtually increased and then reduced metabolic
demand of neurons and glial cells during CSD. Recently, it
was demonstrated that a reverse order of events, i.e. a
vascular event able to trigger CSD, may also be possible
[6, 7]. Dreier et al. [6] showed that the vasoconstrictive
peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced change characteristic
of CSD in the rat cortex, as ET-1 is not capable of inducing
CSD in rat brain slices without intact perfusion, it was
suggested that a vascular mediated event act as a trigger for
CSD. Brennan and co-workers [7] showed that vasomotor
changes in the cerebral cortex travel at a significantly
greater velocity than the neuronal changes, with a different
pattern (circuitous along arterioles as opposed to the

concentric parenchymal CSD pattern), and dissociated
from neuronal changes (it extended beyond the margins of
the spread of parenchymal CSD). Thus, although it is
generally accepted that during a migraine attack alterations
in neuronal activity precede vascular changes, their data
suggest that vascular alterations may trigger neuronal
dysfunction. The clinical observation that migraine is
associated with monogenetic cerebral small vessel diseases
further indicates that vascular changes may increase susceptibility
to migraine. Here, we discuss in more detail
three entities: cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
(CADASIL), retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy
(RVCL) and hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal
arteriolar tortuosity and leucoencephalopathy (HIHRATL).
Genetic vasculopathies
Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is a monogenic disease
characterized by middle-age onset of cerebrovascular
disease that often progress to dementia. Around 30 % of
CADASIL patients are affected by migraine attacks—
the majority with aura—often as the first symptom of the
disease. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the
NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19. The NOTCH3
gene encodes for a transmembrane receptor, which is
solely expressed in vascular muscle cells in humans.
Histopathological findings in CADASIL consist of
degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells with adjacent
deposits of granular osmiophilic material and fibrous
thickening of the arterial walls. Cerebral magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) reveals characteristic white matter
hyperintensities (WMHs) with or without lacunar infarctions
and microbleeds [8]. The number, sites and type of
lesions are age-dependent. Site of predilection of WMHs
are the anterior temporal lobe, the periventricular white
matter, external and internal capsule and the pons [9]. The
prevalence of migraine in CADASIL ranges from 14 to
72 % in European studies [9–11]. The four studies from
Asian countries [12] found a low migraine prevalence of
5 %. When the results are pooled, the overall prevalence
of migraine in all CADASIL studies is 38 % with a 95 %
CI 33–42 %. The migraine prevalence in CADASIL was
higher in females than in males, but this difference did not
reach statistical significance [12]. The percentage of
migraine with aura could only be inferred from two of the
larger study [9, 10], which showed that the majority
(80–90 %) of migraneurs with CADASIL have migraine
with aura. Vahedi et al. [13] reported that migraine aura in
CADASIL is typical in 44 % of cases, while the other
56 % also experience atypical features: aura without
headache, hemiplegic auras, basilar-type-migraine symptoms
, prolonged aura and acute-onset aura. Vahedi et al.
[13] investigated possible associations between MRI
abnormalities and migraine in CADASIL and found that
MRI findings did not differ between patients with
migraine with aura and those without migraine. Moreover,
no association was found between migraine and WHMs
and lacunar infarcts in pons, occipital lobe and cerebellum.
Imaging studies of cerebral hemodynamics in CADASIL
reported decreased total cerebral blood flow [14] and
decreased cerebral perfusion in normal and abnormal
appearing white matter [15]. Also, decreased vasoreactivity
was found in areas of WMH.
Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy is a
neurovascular syndrome that primarily involves the retina
and the central nervous system [16]. The most prominent
symptom is a vascular retinopathy. Neurological manifestations
may include cognitive disturbances, depression,
migraine (mainly without aura) and focal neurological
symptoms. In later disease stages, cerebral MRI scans often
show characteristic contrast-enhancing intracerebral mass
lesions.
Several systemic symptoms can be present including
renal and liver dysfunction, Raynaud’s phenomenon and
gastro-intestinal bleeding. RCLV is caused by mutation in
the TREX1 gene located on chromosome 3. Histopathological
examination of cerebral tissue [17] showed white
matter necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis, thrombosis of microvessels
with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and
reactive gliosis of astroglia. In one of the families, electron
microscopic examination showed a multilaminated capillary
basement membrane. Because of the other prominent
clinical features, especially the retinopathy and intracerebral
mass lesions, not much attention was given to the
occurrence of migraine in RCLV families. However, in a
large Dutch RVCL family (n = 54), genetic evidence was
obtained that TREX1 might act as a genetic modifier for
migraine [18].
Hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal arteriolar tortuosity
and leucoencephalopathy, a genetic vasculopathy
that affects both cerebral and retinal small vessels, is
caused by mutations in the COL4A1 gene that is located on
chromosome 13. Migraine with aura has been described in
a family with HIHRATL carrying COL4A1 mutation
G652E [19]. The COL4A1 gene encodes the a1 chain of
type IV collagen, a ubiquitous expressed basement membrane
protein. Histopathological examination of brain tissue
of COL4A1 mutation carriers has not been performed
yet. However, in COL4A1 mutant mice, the cerebral vascular
basement membrane is affected and present local
disruptions, irregular thickening and enlargement of
endothelial cells. Of note, in a family with hereditary
poroencephaly, carrying a COL4A1 mutation, migraine

without aura was described in one patient, while in two
other patients the migraine subtype was not specified [20].
Pathophysiological considerations
CADASIL, RVCL and HIHRATL with COL4A1 mutation
have migraine as part of the phenotype and in these conditions
the integrity of cerebral and systemic small vessels
is affected.
The mechanism by which these vasculopathies can
increase the risk of migraine is unknown and different
hypothesis can be formulated.
Shared genetic factors
The co-occurrence with migraine may be causally related
to certain NOTCH3, TREX1 and COL4A1 mutations. In
this case, the genes may be considered to increase
the susceptibility for migraine. For the TREX1 gene, a
genetic, family-based, association study demonstrated that
the RVCL locus slightly enhances the susceptibility for
migraine [18]. One study found an association between the
NOTCH3 polymorphism G684A and migraine, but this has
to be confirmed [21], on the other hand no association was
found between the NOTCH3 polymorphism T6746C and
migraine [22]. Unfortunately, studies performed thus far
have the limitations of small sample size.
Vascular endothelial dysfunction
There is evidence that migraine attacks are associated with
endothelial dysfunction. Migraine prevalence is increased
in persons with polymorphisms linked to endothelial
function [23, 24], moreover, circulating endothelial progenitor
cell numbers and function are reduced in migraine
patients [25]. In CADASIL and RVCL, pathological
changes in endothelial cells may interfere with endothelial
function and alter vascular reactivity. Endothelial function
has been studied in CADASIL. Mice expressing the
mutated protein display early dysfunction in vasoreactivity
with decreased flow-induced dilatation and increased
pressure-induced myogenic tone. In CADASIL patients,
impaired endothelial function was also found in two studies
[26, 27].
Neuronal mechanism
Cortical spreading depression is considered the underlying
mechanism of the migraine aura. A hypothesis for the
increased prevalence of MA in CADASIL could be that
vascular changes make the cortex more susceptible to CSD,
thereby increasing the risk for MA. Indeed in CADASIL
patients, a reduced cerebral baseline flow [27], a decreased
cerebrovascular reactivity [14, 15] and an impaired endothelial
function [26, 27] were demonstrated. Furthermore, it
was recently shown that vasomotor changes can precede
neuronal dysfunction [7] and that a vascular event, such as
a clinical insignificant ischemia, is able to trigger CSD [6].
These observations strengthen this hypothesis for CADASIL.
Increased susceptibility for CSD seems a less plausible
mechanism for RVCL, as this syndrome is mainly
associated with MO. However, it could also form an
explanation for the occurrence of MA in three out of six
family members with HIHRATL.
Besides these genetic vasculopathies patients with
migraine often present on brain MRI white matter lesions
that resemble ischemic infarcts in the territory of small
cerebral vessel. The CAMERA study [28] suggests that
patients affected by migraine are independently at
increased risk for subclinical brain lesions, in particular in
the posterior circulation. This was evident only among
patient affected by migraine with aura and particularly for
those with at least 12 migraine episodes for year. In a
recent study, migraine with aura in midlife correlates in
women with late-life prevalence of cerebellar infarct-like
lesions on MRI. These data persisted after controlling for
cardiovascular risk factors and history of cardiovascular
disease [29]. The cause and mechanisms of white matter
lesions remain subject to debate. Prolonged and repeated
oligemia during migraine attacks may affect the vulnerable
small deep penetrating arteries, and local critical hypoperfusion
may lead to minor brain injury revealed as white
matter lesions. Other proposed mechanisms include atherosclerotic
causes including common cardiovascular risk
factors, endothelial dysfunction, shared genetic risk factors
for migraine and stroke, medications with vasoconstrictor
activity and cardiac abnormalities including patent foramen
ovale.
Conclusion
In genetic small vessel diseases, vascular changes including
endothelial dysfunction, may directly or via neuronal
pathways increase the risk for migraine. Alternatively,
DNA variants in the susceptibility genes may directly
form a risk factor for migraine and the syndrome itself.
For genetic as well as acquired vasculopathies, research
into endothelial function and shared genetic factors
will be important to understand the pathophysiological
mechanisms that can explain their comorbidity with
migraine.
