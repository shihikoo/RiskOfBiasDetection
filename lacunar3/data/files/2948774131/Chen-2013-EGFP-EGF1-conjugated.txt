Abstract
Injured endothelium is an important target for drug and/or gene therapy because brain microvascular endothelial cells
(BMECs) play critical roles in various pathophysiological conditions. RNA-mediated gene silencing presents a new
therapeutic approach for treating such diseases, but major challenge is to ensure minimal toxicity and target delivery of
siRNA to injured BMECs. Injured BMECs overexpress tissue factor (TF), which the fusion protein EGFP-EGF1 could be targeted
to. In this study, TNF alpha (TNF-a) was chosen as a stimulus for primary BMECs to produce injured endothelium in vitro. The
EGFP-EGF1-PLGA nanoparticles (ENPs) with loaded TF-siRNA were used as a new carrier for targeted delivery to the injured
BMECs. The nanoparticles then produced intracellular RNA interference against TF. We compared ENP-based transfections
with NP-mediated transfections, and our studies show that the ENP-based transfections result in a more efficient
downregulation of TF. Our findings also show that the TF siRNA-loaded ENPs had minimal toxicity, with almost 96% of the
cells viable 24 h after transfection while Lipofectamine-based transfections resulted in only 75% of the cells. Therefore, ENP-
based transfection could be used for efficient siRNA transfection to injured BMECs and for efficient RNA interference (RNAi).
This transfection could serve as a potential treatment for diseases, such as stroke, atherosclerosis and cancer.

Introduction
Endothelial cells lining the inner surfaces of microvessels form
a barrier that actively participates in the blood–tissue exchange of
plasma fluid, proteins and cells. Thus these cells play an important
role in maintaining circulatory homeostasis and the physiological
functions of different organs. Brain microvascular endothelial cells
(BMECs) are a type of endothelial cell and act as a barrier to any
invading pathogens [1,2] in the brain. Injured endothelial cells are
associated with crucial events that occur during the development
of a variety of diseases, such as stroke, atherosclerosis, and tumor
[3]; thus, the targeting of these cells could be a treatment for these
diseases.
Tissue factor (TF) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein and the
primary initiator of blood coagulation. TF is involved in the
thrombosis and inammation that are associated with sepsis,
atherosclerosis, and cancer. TF can participate in other pathological
processes, such as metastasis, tumor-associated angiogenesis,
and tumor growth [4,5]. The therapeutic targeting of TF is
a promising method for treating these diseases. Under normal
conditions, the endothelium provides an anticoagulant surface,
a property that is lost after injury. Following vessel injury, the
membrane-bound TF is exposed to circulating blood, which
activates coagulation factor VII (FVII) and may trigger thrombosis
[6,7]. Numerous inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, interleukin-1
, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and thrombin induce
endothelial TF expression by injuring the endothelium [8,9].
Thus, TNF-a can act as a stimulus by increasing the TF
expression in endothelial cells.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising strategy in gene
therapy for the treatment of diverse diseases because of its superior
capability for silencing a target gene [10] using an RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) [11]. However, because of its size and
negative charge, siRNA cannot easily cross cell membranes.
Delivery has therefore been one of the most significant challenges
in siRNA therapeutics [12,13].
Currently, nanoparticles composed of PLGA are attractive for
use in gene silencing applications because of their high stability,
low toxicity, and the possibility for controlled release of their cargo
[14–16]. Moreover, targeting has been achieved by attaching
a targeting molecule or protein to these nanoparticles [17]. Our
previous studies indicated that the fusion protein derived from
FVII has a specific TF binding capacity but dose not cause
coagulation [18] and can enhance the binding ability of PLGA
nanoparticles to regions with exposed TF [19]. Thus, EGFPEGF1
modified PLGA nanoparticles may be a suitable delivery
vehicle for siRNAs.

In this study, TF was chosen as the therapeutic target for siRNA
therapy. The endothelial cells that are injured by TNF-a overexpressed
TF. The nanoparticles were composed of the biodegradable
and biocompatible polymer poly-(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) (PLGA) and the nanoparticles and the EGFP-EGF1 fusion
protein was attached to the nanoparticle surfaces. The EGFPEGF1-conjugated
PLGA nanoparticles (ENPs) were used as a new
targeted carrier for TF-specific siRNA and enabled siRNA
delivery into injured primary BMECs. The physical properties of
the nanoparticles, the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles, the siRNA
release in vitro from the nanoparticles, and the gene silencing effect
were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
nanoparticle targeted delivery of TF-specific siRNA to injured
primary endothelial cells has been successfully studied.
Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials and Animals
The E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and plasmid pET-28a-EGFPEGF1
were maintained in our laboratory. Poly-(D, L lactic-coglycolic
acid) (PLGA, 50:50, inherent viscosity of 0.89,
MW,100 kDa) was purchased from Absorbable Polymers
(USA). Methoxy-poly-(ethylene glycol) (M-PEG, MW 3000 Da)
was purchased from the NOF Co. (lot no.14530, Japan) and
Maleimide-PEG (Mal-PEG, MW 3400 Da) was purchased from
Nektar Co. (lot no.PT-08D-16, USA). Cy3-labeled negative
siRNAs were purchased from the RiboBio Co. (Guangzhou,
China). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against to the rat TF antibody
was purchase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA). Flow
cytometry antibody (CD142) was purchased from BD Biosciences
(USA). Medium 131, MVGS, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (high glucose) (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum (FBS)
were purchased from Life Technologies Corporation (USA). All
other chemicals were analytical reagent grades, purchased from
the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (China).
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (50–60 g, =) were provided by the
Center of Experimental Animals at Tongji Medical College
(Wuhan, China). The protocols for treating the animals during the
experiment were evaluated and approved by the Tongji Medical
College ethical committee.
2.2. Cells
BMECs were separated from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (50–
60 g, =) as previously described [20–22] and cultured in
Medium131 (M131), which has been supplemented with 5%
MVGS, at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon
dioxide(CO
2
). The cells were cultured in the medium and the
experiments were conducted in 3–6 passages. TNF-a [23] was
added, 100 ng/ml, to injure the endothelium in vitro. Rat C6
glioma cells (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking
Union Medical College, Beijing, China) were cultured in DMEM
(high glucose) which consisted of 10% FBS and antibiotics
(including 100 mg/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin
) at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
2
.
2.3. Synthesis and in vitro Screening of siRNAs
The three siRNAs with the lowest predicted off-target potentials
and 100% homology with the rat TF gene sequence
NM_013057.2 were selected for synthesis and screening. The
siRNAs were obtained from the Life Technologies Corporation
(USA).
Rat C6 glioma cells, which naturally overexpress TF, were
transfected with siRNAs using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols in
concentration ranging from 10 nM to 100 nM. TF mRNA levels
were quantified 24 h after transfection by real time PCR and
normalized using GAPDH mRNA. The best RNAi concentration
was 40 nM. The best duplex, with the sequence of 59-
GCAAUGACUUGGGUUAUAUdTdT-39 (sense) and, 59-
AUAUAACCCAAGUCAUUGCdTdT-39 (antisense), was selected
for scaling up, formulation and subsequent in vivo work.
2.4. Preparation of siRNA-loaded NPs and siRNA-loaded
ENPs
The siRNA-loaded NPs were prepared using a water-in-oil-inwater
(w/o/w) double emulsion solvent evaporation method
similar to the one previously reported [24]. In brief, a solution
of 40 mg of siRNA in 50 ml of DEPC MilliQ water containing Ac-
BSA [25] was mixed with dichloromethane (DCM) containing
Me-PEG-PLGA and Mal-PEG-PLGA (weight ratio 10:1), and the
mixture was emulsified by sonicating it for 20 s in a primary w/o
emulsion. Two milliliters of 2% sodium cholate in MilliQ water
was poured directly into the primary emulsion, and this mixture
was further emulsified by sonicating it 20 times (1 s sonication and
1 s arrest) to form a w/o/w double emulsion. The resulting
emulsion was diluted with 35 ml of 2% sodium cholate in MilliQ
water and heated for 15 min at 37uC to evaporate the DCM. The
nanoparticles were then collected using ultracentrifugation at
14000 rpm for 40 min at 4uC and resuspended in DEPC-treated
PBS (0.01 M, pH = 7.4). EGFP-EGF1-PLGA nanoparticles were
prepared by incubating purified thiolated EGFP-EGF1 with the
PLGA nanoparticle solution for 8 h under an N
2
gas atmosphere.
The siRNA-loaded ENPs were passed through a 1.5620 cm
Sepharose CL-4B column and eluted using PBS (0.01 M,
pH =7.4) to remove the unconjugated proteins. The nanoparticles
were then collected using ultracentrifugation at 14000 rpm for
40 min at 4uC and resuspended in DEPC-treated PBS (0.01 M,
pH =7.4). The preparation of NPs labeled with 6-coumarin was
the same as above except that 30 ml of 6-coumarin (1 mg/ml stock
solution in methyl cyanides) was added into the 1 ml of DCM
before primary emulsification.
2.5. Characterization of Nanoparticles
The mean diameter and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using the zeta
potential/particle sizer Nicomp 380 ZLS (Particle Sizing Systems,
Santa Barbara, USA). The nanoparticles were morphologically
examined by transmission electron microscopy (H-600, Hitachi,
Japan). In vitrorelease experiments were performed at 37uC in PBS
(0.01 M) with pH = 7.4 and pH =4.0 for a period of 72 h. The
siRNA-loaded ENPs were incubated at a nanoparticle concentration
of 10 mg/mL in a rotary shaker at 100 rpm and 37uC. Three
samples were taken for each time point studied. The samples were

treated using the same method described by Dongmei et al. [14].
The extracted siRNAs were quantified by nucleic acid determination
(NanoDrop1000 Spectrophotometer,Thermo Scientific
, USA). Each sample was analyzed three times. The drug
loading capacity (DLC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were
determined using the same method and calculated according to

2.6. Cellular Uptake and siRNA Tracking Study
BMECs were seeded at a density of 16105 per well in 6-well
plates, incubated for 24 h, and checked under a microscope for
similar confluency and morphology. The ENPs and NPs were
labeled with 6-coumarin. The BMECs were treated with TNF-
a (100 ng/ml). Simultaneously, one type of nanoparticle was
added in the presence of serum-free media, and the mixture was
incubated for 4 h at 37uC. The cells were washed 2 times with

PBS (0.01 M, pH = 7.4) and immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 min at room temperature. To stain the cell nuclei, the
cells were incubated with DAPI (1 mg/ml) for 10 min at room
temperature avoid light. Normal BMECs were incubated with the
nanoparticles or PBS to serve as a control. To visualize the siRNA
intracellular distribution, double-stranded siRNA was labeled with
Cy3.
2.7. In Vitro Transfection Experiments
The BMECs were seeded at a density of 16105 per well in 6-
well plates and grown to reach 70–80% conuence. The fresh
serum-free DMEM (high glucose) containing different nanoparticle
formulations, including NPs, ENPs, siRNA-loaded NPs, and
siRNA-loaded ENPs, and TNF-a (100 ng/ml) was mixed and
incubated at 37uC in a 5% CO
2
humidified atmosphere for 6 h.
The final concentration of siRNA in these nanoparticles was
40 nM. A negative control was prepared with PBS alone. After
treatment, the cells were washed 2 times with PBS, trypsinized by
0.25% trypsinase, and collected. The TF expression was determined
by the real time PCR, western blot, and ow cytometry.
Moreover, cell supernatants were harvested for TF activity assays.
2.7.1. Real time PCR. To determine the downregulation of
the TF mRNA level, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Conversion of total cellular RNA to
cDNA was conducted using the Prime Script RT reagent Kit
(Takara Bio, Japan). The total cDNA pool was obtained and
served as a template for subsequent PCR amplification with
primers specific to TF (sense primer: 59-GTGCACTGAGCAATGGAAGA-39, antisense primer: 59-AGGCCATGAAGGGAGTCTTT-39) and to GAPDH (sense primer: 59-
ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTA-39, antisense primer: 59-
GGCACAGTCAAGGGCTGAGAATG-39). Quantitative PCR
amplification was performed in a real-time fluorescent measurement
system (ABI Step One, USA) using the SYBR Premix Ex
TaqTM kit (Takara Bio, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. The TF mRNA levels were normalized using GAPDH.
2.7.2. Western blot assay. To determine the TF protein
levels, the collected BMECs were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
(0.01 M, pH =7.4) and then lysed in a protein buffer containing
1:50 protease inhibitor cocktails (Guge Biotech Co., China). Cell
lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 12000 rpm and 4uC
(Eppendorf Centrifuge5804R, USA) and the supernatant was
collected. Total protein extracts were determined using the BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Equal amounts of
protein (30 mg) were separated via SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes, and exposed to a polyclonal anti-TF
antibody (1:250, Santa Cruz, USA). Immunoreactive bands were
detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL detection kit
(Thermo Scientific, USA) with GAPDH (1:1000, Boster, China)
as a loading control. The optical intensities of the TF bands were
normalized to the GAPDH protein bands using the Gel-Pro
Analyzer software.
2.7.3. Flow cytometry. To confirm the western blot results,
the collected cells were washed 2 times with cold PBS (0.01 M,
pH =7.4). Viable cells were counted and resuspended in 100 mlof
PBS (106/cell). The cells were stained with 10 ml of a PE-labeled
anti-CD142 antibody (BD Biosciences, USA) and kept on ice for
30 min in the dark, and one sample was stained with 3 mlofPIas
a control. The samples were then washed, resuspended (500 mlof
PBS), and analyzed using a flow cytometery (Becton Dickinson
FACSort, USA) to determine the TF protein levels.
2.7.4. TF activity assay. The TF activity of different
treatments was determined using the AssaySense Human Tissue
Factor Chromogenic Activity Assay Kit (AssayPro, USA). The cell
supernatants were incubated at 37uC with human FVIIa and FX,
enabling the formation of TF/FVIIa complexes. The conversion
of FX to FXa was measured by using the ability of FXa to cleave
a chromogenic substrate. The absorbance (A) was measured at
405 nm with microplate reader. A standard curve was established
using recombinant human TF lipoprotein to ensure that the results
were in the linear range of detection.

nanoparticles at different points in time were examined. The cumulative release rates were calculated for n = 3, as the mean6SD.

2.8 Cytotoxicity Assay
BMECs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.56104
cells per well in 500 ml of M131 and incubated for 24 h. The cells
were then transfected, as described earlier, using Lipofectamine
2000 or nanoparticles. There were four wells for each mixture.
Twenty four hours following transfection, 40 ml of CCK-8
(Dojindo, Japan) was added to each well, and the mixtures were
incubated for 4 h. The absorbance (A) was measured at 450 nm
with a microplate reader (BioTek, USA). The cell viabilities were
normalized using blank cells.
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of ENPs at higher concentrations,
BMECs were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per
well in 100 ml of M131 and incubated for 24 h. After the media
was replaced with a fresh medium, ENPs with siRNA concentrations
ranging from 0 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml were added into the cells,
followed by a 24 h incubation period. There were four cells for
each concentration. CCK-8 assays were performed similarly to the
experiments above. NPs with siRNA, ENPs, and siRNAs were
used as controls.
Results
3.1. Characterization of Nanoparticles
The nanoparticles prepared by blending M-PEG-PLGA and
Mal-PEG-PLGA had an average diameter of approximately
92 nm, and this diameter increased to approximately 100 nm
after EGFP-EGF1 conjugation. When the siRNAs were entrapped
in the nanoparticles, the ENPs and NPs had average diameters of
106 nm and 96 nm, respectively. The zeta potential values of
siRNA-loaded NPs and siRNA-loaded ENPs were negative and
ranged from 29mVto211 mV (Table. 1.).
The nanoparticles were generally spherical and uniform. And
the conjugation of the EGFP-EGF1 fusion protein is shown in

efficiency prepared using the double emulsion solvent evaporation
(DESE) method [26], the drug loading capacity of the ENPs and
NPs were 1.3660.01 mg/mg and 1.3260.01 mg/mg, respectively.
No differences were observed in the drug loading capacity (DLC)
and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of ENPs and NPs (Table. 2.).
The cumulative release rates of siRNA in PBS (0.01 M) over 6
hours at pHs of 4.0 and 7.4 were 42.5% and 42.49%, respectively.
The siRNAs were delay-released over the next 72 hours. There
was no significant difference in the in vitro release rate (Fig. 2).
3.2. BMECs’ Uptake of Nanoparticles and siRNA Cellular
Tracking
The BMECs could take up NPs and ENPs, both the 6-
coumarin-labeled and siRNA-loaded ones (Fig. 3.C and D). The
fluorescence intensity of the TNF-a-induced BMECs was higher
for the ENPs than for the NPs (Fig. 3.A and B). As depicted in
Fig. 4, the fluorescence intensity of the TNF-a-induced BMECs
(Fig. 3.A) was higher than the normal ones (Fig. 3.C) when treated
with the ENPs. This result illustrated that the ENPs could more
efficiently bind to the TF-expressing BMECs than the NPs could.
This conclusion was consistent with a previous study [19].
As depicted in Fig. 4, it was clear that the injured cells could up
take siRNA-loaded ENPs (Fig. 4.B) and the Cy3-labeled siRNA
could be transferred into the treated BMECs (Fig. 4.A) with 4 h
using the ENPs. And there was almost coincidence between the 6-
coumarin-loaded ENPs (Green) and the Cy3-labeled siRNAs (Red)
in cytoplasm (Fig. 4.D).
3.3. Cytotoxicity Evaluation

formulations evaluated using the CCK-8 kit assay. Our results
showed that cells transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 exhibited

a higher cytotoxicity over a 24 h time period than the cells
transfected with ENPs or NPs which exhibited almost no
cytotoxicity. In the primary BMECs transfected, the cell viability
was 96.5162.95% with ENP transfection and 96.2862.02% with
NP transfection as compared with only 74.8262.57% with
Lipofectamine 2000 transfection (Fig. 5.A). Moreover, there was
no significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity for the different
nanoparticles (Fig. 5.B).
3.4. Effect of TF-siRNA-loaded ENPs on TF Expression
The real-time PCR results showed that the TF mRNA level of
the injured BMECs exhibited an approximately 4.1-fold decrease
following transfection with TF-siRNA-loaded ENPs compared
with the control (Fig. 6.A). The downregulation efficiency is higher
than the NP-based transfection rate.
The TF protein levels were determined by western blot (Fig. 6.B)
and flow cytometry (Fig. 6.C). The western blot results showed
that the TF protein expression was only 58.5% in the injured
BMECs and that the downregulation efficiency exhibited a 1.41-
fold increase compared with that for TF-siRNA-loaded NP
transfection. The flow cytometry results confirmed the western
blot results. The CD142 expression percentage in the injured
BMECs was 9.17% following transfection with TF-siRNA-loaded
ENPs, while the percentage in injured BMECs without transfection
was 42.26%.
3.5. Effect of TF-siRNA Loaded ENPs on TF Activity
To evaluate the TF activity of the different BMECs
treatments, TF activity assays were performed (Fig. 7). The
results showed that the TF activity of the injured BMECs
exhibited an approximately 3.52-fold compared with the normal
cells. Following the TF-siRNA-loaded ENPs transfection, the TF
activity was 19.59% that for the injured BMECs. This activity
was a 1.5-fold increase over the TF-siRNA-loaded NPs transfection
activity.
Discussion
Tissue factor (TF) is a 47-kDa transmembrane cellular receptor
for FVII/VIIa, which is no longer perceived as an ‘alternative’
coagulation factor, but rather as a central trigger for coagulation
cascade, and an important cell-associated signaling receptor
activated by factor VIIa and TF interacts with several other
regulatory entities, such as protease-activated receptors (PAR-1
and PAR-2) [6,7,27]. Moreover, TF is involved in the pathogenesis
of cancer, such as tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and,
possibly, formation of the cancer stem cell niche [27]. Therefore,
therapeutic strategies are being developed to specifically interfere
with TF.
SiRNA has been generally investigated for use in therapies
for various diseases. TF-specific siRNAs have been investigated
in previous studies on breast cancer [28]. The use of siRNA is
limited due to its poor stability, insufficient cellular uptake, and
the safety problems associated with their carriers. An ideal
delivery carrier for siRNA needs to have several features such as
targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues, persistently activate
RNA interference (RNAi) with a high efficiency, and an
excellent safety profile [29]. PLGA nanoparticles are a suitable
choice and can be modified for targeted delivery [30,31]. Here,
EGFP-EGF1 modified PLGA nanoparticles served as a new
carrier for TF-siRNA. First, the nanoparticles loaded with
siRNAs have an average diameter of approximately 100 nm,
which is suitable for pharmaceutical applications [32]. To
visualize the nanoparticles they were labeled with 6-coumarin.
The cellular uptake assay shows that the normal primary
BMECs could take up ENPs and NPs (Fig. 3.C and D), which
are internalized in the cells through fluid-phase pinocytosis and
endocytosis. However, the fluorescence intensity of the TNF-ainduced
BMECs is higher for the ENPs than for the NPs
(Fig. 3.A and B) which accounts for the TNF-a-induced BMECs
could take up the ENPs better than the NPs. And the injured
BMECs could take up the ENPs better than the normal cells
(Fig. 3.A and C). The results show that EGFP-EGF1 could
enhance the location concentration of PLGA nanoparticles in
the injured BMECs because of its ability to target these TF-
expressing cells [19]. As the in vitro release experiments show,
siRNAs can be released from the nanoparticles (Fig. 2).
Moreover, the Cy3-labeled-siRNAs (Red) and the 6-coumarin
labeled ENPs (Green) can be determined in the injured BMECs
at the same time after transfection (Fig. 4.D). It illustrates the
released siRNAs can enter the injured primary BMECs by the
ENPs. All of these results show that the ENPs have the capacity
for targeted delivery to specific cells. Second, when the TF-
siRNA was transfected into the injured BMECs by the ENPs or
NPs, it guided sequence-specific gene silencing of the target
mRNAs that they were perfectly complemented by directing the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to mediate site-specific
cleavage and to destroy the mRNA [33]. The results were
shown in the mRNA and protein levels we can see an efficient
downregulation of TF in the injured BMECs. However, the
gene knockdown efficiency is apparently different for the
treatments using the siRNA/ENPs and the siRNA/NPs. It’s
possible that more of the TF-siRNA carried by the ENPs could
enter the injured BMECs than that carried by the NPs because
the new carrier has the targeted delivery. The efficient gene
silencing shows that the new carrier has the capacity for
persistently activate RNAi with a high efficiency. The use of
traditional carriers, such as liposomes and viral vectors, is
limited by safety issues, such acute toxicity, cellular immune
response, and quality control. However, PLGA is approved by
Figure 7. The TF activity was determined using the TF activity
assay kit. The relative fold of TF activity was normalized using the
normal BMECs. **P,0.01,11P,0.01,##P,0.05.

siRNA-Loaded ENPs for Efficient RNA Interference

the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European
Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in various drug delivery
systems in humans. As the CCK8-assay showed, the EGFPEGF1-PLGA
nanoparticles had no significant dose-dependent
cytotoxicity over 0–4 mg/ml range, while the Lipofectamine2000
had apparent dose-dependent cytotoxicity (Fig. 5).
Thus, the new carrier has an excellent safety profile.
It is generally believed that most TF on the surfaces of cells
surrounding blood vessels exist in a state with very little
procoagulant activity and must undergo a transformation to
become fully active [34]. The aberrant activation of TF-
mediated coagulation leads to intravascular thrombus formation.
It is also well established that active TF is a link between the
activation of the coagulation system and cancer [27]. As the TF
activity assay showed, the TF activity of the injured primary
BMECs is approximately 4 times higher than that of the normal
ones. Nevertheless, there is a significant decrease following
ENP-mediated siRNA transfection (Fig. 7). Perhaps the
efficiency decrease in TF expression has an effect on the TF
activity.
Endothelial injury is involved in the pathogenesis of
pathologic processes ranging from vascular diseases to cancer
and metastasis [35]. TNF-a mediated endothelial injuries are
related to acute inflammation, which leads to TF overexpression
[36–37]. BMECs are a type of endothelial cell and play an
important role in many brain diseases. Therapies targeted to
injured endothelium are in urgent demand. In this study, we
have proven that ENPs could target these cells and efficiently
transfer TF-siRNAs into them. Then, the siRNAs would bring
about gene knockdown. Thus, this new targeted delivery system
for TF-siRNAs may be used for brain diseases that involve
endothelium injury.
In this study, the ENPs that served as a new targeted delivery
system of siRNAs have been shown to target injured BMECs.
Western blot and flow cytometry analysis results revealed that
ENP-mediated siRNA transfection is more efficient and longer
sustained than NP-mediated transfection in injured primary
BMECs. Functional assays (TF activity assays) confirmed that
the TF-siRNAs released from the nanoparticles maintained their
functional integrity. The new delivery system showed almost no
cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that the use of these ENPs for
downregulation of TF expression may serve as an effective
treatment for various diseases that involved endothelium injury.
Our future studies will focus on the use of these ENPs to treat
these diseases in vivo.
