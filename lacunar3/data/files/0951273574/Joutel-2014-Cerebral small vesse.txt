Diseases of the cerebral vasculature contribute to diverse 
forms of brain dysfunction, injury, and cell death. 
Small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain accounts for ≈25% 
to 30% of strokes and is a leading cause of age-related and 
hypertension-related cognitive decline and disability.1 Despite 
its impact on the brain, there are currently no specific treatments
for SVD, and therapeutic options for secondary prevention
are particularly limited compared with those for other 
common causes of stroke.
Cerebral SVD refers to pathological processes that affect 
the structure or function of small vessels on the surface 
and within the brain, including arteries, arterioles, capillaries
, venules, and veins.1 Clinically, the consequences of 
pathological changes of small vessels of the brain can be 
detected with neuroimaging. These consequences include 
white matter hyperintensities, small infarctions or hemorrhages
in white or deep gray matter, enlargement of perivascular
spaces, and brain atrophy.2,3 SVD can progress silently 
for many years before becoming clinically evident.2 Hence, 
medical scientists must not only address the clinical impact 
of SVD but also identify targets for prevention and early 
treatment. Both these tasks require a better understanding of 
the pathogenesis of SVD.
The majority of SVD is sporadic and seems driven by a 
complex mix of genetic and cardiovascular risk factors, 
among which age and hypertension are deemed the most 
important.1,2 Rare monogenic forms of SVD have been identified
and offer excellent opportunities for mechanistic studies 
using genetic models based on familial disease mutations.4 In 
some cases, genetic and sporadic forms of SVD may exhibit 
common underlying mechanisms. This article focuses on 
Mendelian forms of SVD, excluding the hereditary cerebral 
amyloid angiopathies, which have been the subject of recent 
reviews.5 Particularly, we review the pathogenesis of collagen 
type IV–related SVD and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 
(CADASIL), 2 archetypal Mendelian SVDs, highlighting 
potential translational implications, and discuss challenges 
and opportunities for the future.
Small Vessels of the Brain: Unique Functional 
Properties
The human brain, although accounting for only ≈2% of the 
body mass, receives ≈20% of cardiac output.6 Blood flow to 
the brain is conducted through intracranial arteries, which 
derive mainly from the circle of Willis, through smaller vessels 
on the brain surface.7 These pial arteries branch extensively 
into smaller arterioles, which then penetrate into the brain 
parenchyma and terminate as an extensive capillary network 
(Figure).7 Penetrating arterioles have relatively few branches 
and are separated from the parenchyma by the Virchow–Robin 
space.7 As this space disappears, vessels that continue and 
pass deeper into the brain are termed parenchymal arterioles. 
Arterioles beyond the Virchow–Robin space and capillaries 
are encased by endfeet processes of astrocytes,8 although the 
interactions between astrocytic endfeet and vascular muscle 
can vary substantially depending on the brain region.9 Blood 
within postcapillary venules, both parenchymal and pial, is then 
drained into dural venous sinuses.7 Regional differences in vascular
anatomy and local perfusion are prominent. For example, 
subcortical white matter is supplied by terminal arterioles with 
limited potential for collateral flow and a lower microvascular 
density compared with the gray matter.10,11 Collectively, such 
differences are thought to make this region particularly vulnerable
to reductions in local microvascular pressure (local perfusion
pressure), hypoperfusion, or ischemia.11
Small vessels of the brain exhibit distinct characteristics.7,10
First, the brain has little means of energy storage. Mechanisms 
that regulate these vessels help to ensure that the brain normally
receives an adequate supply of blood under a variety 
of conditions. The primary determinants of resting cerebral 
blood flow (CBF) include perfusion pressure, autoregulatory

mechanisms, and vascular reactivity to the partial pressure of 
arterial CO
2
.7,10 Local changes in cellular activity (mostly neurons
and glia) modulate CBF above or below this baseline level. 
Increases in cellular activity normally increase CBF, which 
serves to support enhanced glucose and oxygen demand.11
Our understanding of this phenomenon, known as functional 
hyperemia or neurovascular coupling, remains an active area 
of research. Local increases in CBF are induced by dilation of 
vascular muscle in nearby arteries and arterioles, supported by 
flow-mediated dilation of upstream vessels, and possibly by 
effects of pericytes on the diameter of capillaries. Both neurons
and astrocytes interact closely with vascular cells and thus 
participate in the regulation of local CBF in response to the 
metabolic needs of surrounding tissue.6,12,13 Second, the brain 
is subjected to wide variations in arterial pressure during daily 
activity. Another important feature of the cerebral vasculature 
is its ability to autoregulate and maintain CBF relatively constant
over a substantial range of arterial pressures.10 In relation 
to mechanisms, autoregulation results from the ability of arteries
and arterioles to constrict or dilate when intravascular pressure
increases or decreases, respectively. Although myogenic 
reactivity is thought to play a major role in these responses, 
other mechanisms likely contribute as well in vivo.10,14 Third, a 
fundamental feature of the central nervous system vasculature 
is reflected by the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), 
which is largely impermeable to the passive movement of cells, 
proteins, and most bioactive compounds present in the blood. 
The BBB consists of endothelial cells anchored to each other 
by tight junction proteins supported by a continuous basement 
membrane.15 At the level of capillaries, the integrity of the BBB 
is also determined by pericytes, which are tightly apposed to 
endothelial cells and fully enwrapped by the same basement 
membrane and perivascular astrocytic endfeet, which cover 
large domains of these microvessels.15,16
Therefore, precise control of CBF to support normal brain 
homeostasis and function relies on an elaborate and sophisticated
ensemble of vascular cells working in concert with 
neurons and astrocytes. In the most distal segment of the circulation
, this complex is often called the neurovascular unit.8
When other portions of the cerebral vasculature are taken into 
account, terms such as the vascular neural network are sometimes
used.17 Considering the complexity of this network, it is 
not surprising that either structural or functional perturbations 
of small vessels in the brain can have dramatic consequences 
regarding function and integrity of white matter.
SVD of the Brain: Why Study Rare  
Mendelian Forms?
Vascular Risk Factor Approach
Because the greatest risk factors for development of SVD 
are cardiovascular, previous efforts to elucidate its pathogenesis
have relied mainly on vascular risk factor approaches. 
Studies of rodents and other models have documented many 
effects (mostly deleterious) of hypertension on the cerebral 
vasculature.18,19 For example, hypertension produces vascular 
structural and functional changes that are thought to contribute
to reductions in resting CBF, impaired vasodilation and 
vasodilator reserve, and shifts in the autoregulatory curve (to 
the right) that increase vulnerability of the brain to hypotension.18,19 Multiple mechanisms likely underlie these changes, 
but angiotensin II, a major therapeutic target in hypertension 
and other forms of cardiovascular disease, seems to play a 
central role.18 Studies of human and animal models suggest 
that interrelated oxidant-dependent and immune-dependent 
mechanisms mediate many of the vascular effects of angiotensin
II, with some effects being independent of changes in 
blood pressure.18–20 However, the direct causal link between

Joutel and Faraci Cerebral Small Vessel Disease 1217
these vascular changes and brain lesions, particularly white 
matter disease and lacunar infarcts, is lacking.
Features of SVD have been described in the microvasculature
in mouse models of hypertension, including impairment 
of vasodilator responses (endothelium-dependent and neurovascular
coupling), narrowing of the arteriolar lumen (inward 
remodeling), and increased permeability of the BBB.18,19 In 
many of these models, the duration of hypertension has been 
relatively short. As a consequence, although studies using 
mouse models of hypertension have provided novel insight 
into mechanisms responsible for cerebrovascular changes, they 
have not yet established whether these models can fully recapitulate
key elements of SVD, including parenchymal injury.21
More work in this area has been performed using rat models
, particularly genetic models of hypertension. Studies of the 
spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, which develop 
cerebral edema and hemorrhage, suggest that disruption of 
the BBB may be a key mechanism by which hypertension 
causes white matter lesions. However, although often cited 
as a model of sporadic SVD, the spontaneously hypertensive 
stroke-prone rat is a model of malignant severe hypertension, 
with blood pressures that are often well beyond the range of 
autoregulation and with variable phenotypic outcome depending
on the dietary regiment.22 Genetic models with more 
modest sustained hypertension also develop features of SVD, 
including reduction in microvascular diameter and activation 
of perivascular microglia, but the specific impact of these 
changes on brain parenchyma is also unclear.23
Despite being a risk factor for SVD, the relationship 
between elevated blood pressure and SVD is complex. Like 
most risk factors for SVD, only a fraction of patients with 
hypertension experiences development of the disease (and 
often only with age), and many patients with SVD are normotensive.
Furthermore, in addition to the magnitude and the 
duration of blood pressure elevation, excessive blood pressure
variability may contribute to the pathogenesis of SVD.2
Particularly in animal models, the lack of attention to vascular 
effects of aging, both alone and in the presence of hypertension
, may partly explain the difficulty in developing better 
models of SVD. Hence, studying the pathogenesis of SVD 
through a vascular risk factor lens remains important but is 
an approach with challenges requiring further improvement.
One-Mutated-Gene-at-a-Time Approach
Familial SVD, largely indistinguishable from sporadic SVD, 
has been characterized in recent years. Highly penetrant 
mutations have been identified in 5 distinct genes, including 
NOTCH3, COL4A1, COL4A2, TREX1, and HTRA1 (Table I in 
the online-only Data Supplement).4 Continued identification 
of related mutations is expected considering recent advances 
in next-generation sequencing technologies. Although there 
are no precise figures, it is increasingly appreciated that 
NOTCH3 and COL41/2 mutations account for a large proportion
of familial SVD, whereas TREX1 and HTRA1 mutations 
are likely very rare.4
Importantly, a single point mutation in these genes is sufficient
to produce a highly penetrant disease, meaning that individuals
carrying a pathogenic variant are at ≈100% risk for 
development of the disease, nearly independent of the environment.
Although rare, these monogenic forms of SVD have 
immediate relevance to sporadic SVD. For example, the overall
clinical and neuroimaging features of CADASIL resemble 
those of the most common sporadic SVD, except for an earlier 
age at onset of stroke events and an increased frequency of 
migraine with aura.24 Moreover, studies of these hereditary 
forms of SVD have provided insight into proteins that play 
critical roles in the cerebral vasculature. For example, type IV 
collagen is a major component of the basement membrane. 
Collagen IV is dispensable for deposition and initial assembly
of components of the basement membrane during early 
development, but it is also required for the maintenance of 
membrane integrity.25 In addition to its structural role, collagen
IV participates in cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions 
through integrin and nonintegrin receptors that are critically 
important for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation.26 As another example, NOTCH3 is a receptor 
predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle and pericytes
, which play a critical role in the maturation and function
of small vessels of the brain.27 Finally, technical advances 
have permitted the generation of predictive relevant mouse 
models based on familial disease mutations. These approaches 
include the ability to express the mutated protein product in 
both temporal and cell-specific fashions.
In summary, the approach of mutating one gene at a time 
has provided significant opportunities to address some of the 
key scientific questions in the quest to identify SVD mechanisms
, including identification of biological pathways that 
promote vascular changes, development of predictive mouse 
models of SVD, and deciphering the causal link(s) between 
vascular changes and resulting brain lesions.
Modeling Mendelian SVD in the Mouse: A 
Mixed Picture
Because of the many technical possibilities that can be used to 
manipulate its genome, the mouse has become an extremely 
popular animal model. Despite these advantages, mice also 
have potential limitations, including relatively small brain and 
body size, short lifespan, and a lower ratio of white versus 
gray matter.
COL4A1/2-Related SVD: A Mouse Model With 
Successful Translation
In the past, large collections of mutant mice have been produced 
by genome-wide random chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl 
N-nitrosourea. After treatment with N-ethyl N-nitrosourea, 
mice are mated in forward phenotypic and genetic screens 
designed to uncover abnormal phenotypes and mutations 
responsible for these phenotypes. With this approach, a variety 
of mouse lines carrying substitutions of glycine residues in the 
collagenous domain of Col4a1 or Col4a2 genes, which play a 
crucial role in the formation and stabilization of the triple-helical
molecule, has been obtained.28 Among these, Col4a1+/∆ex41
mice (formerly called Col4a1+/∆ex40), which express a mutant 
collagen α-1(IV) chain with a 17 aa inframe deletion because 
of a mutation in the splice acceptor site of exon 41 (formerly 
called exon 40), have been the most extensively characterized.

1218 Stroke April 2014
At birth, all heterozygous Col4a1+/∆ex41 mutant pups have cerebral
hemorrhage, and approximately half of them die within 
1 day.29 A small proportion of young adult mice has porencephalic
cavities.29 Notably, adult mice also have development of 
spontaneous multifocal recurrent intracerebral hemorrhages, 
predominantly in the basal ganglia, that can be symptomatic or 
clinically silent.30 Unfortunately, we are not aware of any pathological
data on cerebral white matter. Interestingly, mutant 
mice also exhibit eye (retinal arterial tortuosity, ocular anterior 
segment dysgenesis, optic nerve hypoplasia), kidney (microalbuminuria
, hematuria), and skeletal muscle abnormalities.28,30
Electron microscopy has demonstrated basement membrane 
defects in cerebral vessels as well as in other tissues of the 
Col4a1 mutant mice, including uneven edges, variable density 
and thickness, focal disruption, splitting, and herniations.30 Of 
major importance, all of these clinical and pathological manifestations
were subsequently recognized in families with SVD, 
and missense mutations resulting in the substitution for 1 of 
the invariant glycine residues within the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats 
in the collagenous domain have been identified in affected 
patients.30,31 COL4A2 assembles with COL4A1 to form the 
heterotrimeric triple helix of collagen IV. Recent studies indicate
that COL4A2 mutations in humans and mice phenocopy 
COL4A1 mutations, although with a lesser severity.28
CADASIL: Incomplete but Relevant Mouse Models
CADASIL is caused by stereotyped missense mutations that 
alter the number of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain 
of NOTCH3 (Notch3ECD), leading to pathological accumulation
and deposition of Notch3ECD at the plasma membrane of 
vascular muscle and in extracellular deposits called granular 
osmiophilic material (GOM).24 Recent studies suggest that 
CADASIL mutations produce novel gain of function(s) of 
mutated protein arising from unique protein–protein interactions
rather than a loss of its canonical function.32 Knock-in 
and transgenic approaches, using smooth muscle–specific 
promoters or a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) containing
the entire Notch3 locus, have been used in the modeling
of CADASIL in mice. These mice develop 2 pathological 
hallmarks of the disease, that is, Notch3ECD aggregates and 
GOM deposits in the brain and peripheral vessels.33 Yet, only 
increased mutant Notch3 levels by a factor of ≥4, under the 
control of the Notch3 promoter (TgPAC-Notch3R169C), result 
in fully penetrant brain lesions. Specifically, PAC-Notch3R169C
transgenic mice exhibit Notch3ECD accumulation and GOM 
deposits by 1 and 5 months of age, respectively, and white 
matter alterations starting at 12 months of age.34 However, 
these mice have normal lifespans and do not exhibit lacunar
infarction. Studies of CADASIL mouse models suggest 
that Notch3ECD and GOM deposits are the earliest vascular 
changes, both occurring before white matter lesions, which 
are likewise the earliest brain parenchyma changes, a finding 
which is clinically relevant.33 In humans, Notch3ECD aggregates 
and GOM deposits can be detected in skin vessels of mutation 
carriers more than a decade before the disease becomes clinically
apparent.24 White matter hyperintensities are the earliest 
detected brain MRI change, preceding the onset of symptoms 
by 10 to 15 years, and have consistently been found in mutation
carriers >35 years of age.24
Why has modeling CADASIL in the mouse been less successful
than modeling collagen IV–related SVD? Compared 
with the latter, CADASIL has a later age of onset and may be 
driven by a toxic gain-of-function mechanism.32 As anticipated 
with such a mechanism, prolonged exposure to the mutant 
protein is assumed to be necessary to trigger cell dysfunction 
or degeneration. It is thus conceivable that the relatively short 
lifespan of mice is limiting. Alternatively, divergent results 
may reflect fundamentally different mechanisms underlying 
these 2 diseases.
Retinal Vasculopathy With Cerebral 
Leukodystrophy and CARASIL
No currently published mouse models stably express retinal 
vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy–linked mutations in 
TREX1. At least 2 different lines of mice with constitutive inactivation
of the HtrA1 gene, which mimics the loss-of-function
nature of Cerebral Autosomal Recessive Arteriopathy with 
Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL)-
associated mutations, have been generated. Reduced capillary
density in the retina has been documented in 1 line35
and increased trabecular bone mass has been documented in 
the second.36 However, there is no mention of brain lesions, 
although the extent to which the brain parenchyma and the 
cerebral vasculature has been analyzed is unclear.
Lessons and Opportunities From Col4A1-
Related SVD and CADASIL Mouse Models
COL4A1/2-Related SVD Mouse Models
In addition to playing a crucial role in the discovery of 
COL4A1/2 mutations in patients with SVD, Col4a1 mouse 
models have proven valuable in elucidating some important 
aspects of the disease.
Head trauma and intensive sport exercises have been 
reported as risk factors of intracerebral hemorrhages.31 Mouse 
studies have shown that surgical delivery of pups carrying the 
Col4a1 mutation strongly reduces the occurrence of severe 
perinatal cerebral hemorrhages, indicating that head trauma, 
particularly during delivery, is a predisposing factor for cerebral
hemorrhages in COL4A1 mutation carriers.30 On the basis 
of this experimental observation, the follow-up of pregnant 
women who carry a pathogenic COL4A1 mutation includes 
repeated ultrasound evaluation and recommendation for a 
cesarean delivery. In addition, the patients and their physicians
are informed about the risk of head trauma.31
Clinical manifestations of COL4A1/2 mutations are 
extremely variable between and even within affected families
, and the age of onset can range from the fetal period to 
adulthood.28 Mouse studies have pinpointed genetic modifiers 
as likely contributors to variable expressivity of the disease. 
Gould et al30 have shown that the phenotype resulting from 
Col4a1 mutation varied greatly among mice depending on 
the genetic background. For example, retinal arteriolar tortuosity
and ocular anterior segment dysgenesis were highly 
penetrant in mice with the C57BL/6J background and almost 
absent in mice with the mixed CAST-BL/6 background.30
Further genetic analyses identified a locus on mouse chromosome
1, which likely contains the modifier gene(s).37 Allelic

heterogeneity may be another source of variability. Notably, 
mutations clustered within the N-terminus of the collagenous 
domain of COL4A1 in humans are associated with a preferential
phenotypic association, which includes the presence 
of arterial aneurysms; a high prevalence of eye, kidney, and 
skeletal manifestations; and Raynaud phenomenon, for which 
the term HANAC (Hereditary Angiopathy with Nephropathy, 
Aneurysms, and Cramps) syndrome has been coined.38 The 
analysis of new mouse models with HANAC syndrome–
associated COL4A1 mutations, under controlled genetic background
, may be of interest to test this possibility.
In addition, the existing Col4a1 mouse models offer a 
unique opportunity to address many unresolved issues in collagen
IV–related SVD, namely the exact mechanisms of white 
matter disease, cerebral hemorrhages, and porencephalic cavities.
Although disruption of the vascular basement membrane 
is likely to compromise vascular integrity, this possibility 
remains to be tested. Furthermore, based on initial studies of 
aorta,39 it is likely that these mutations also affect function in 
small cerebral vessels.
CADASIL Mouse Models
The analysis of CADASIL mouse models, particularly the 
PAC-Notch3R169C transgenic mouse model that recapitulates 
the presymptomatic stage of the human disease, has dramatically
changed our view of the starting point for this disease.
A key initial finding relates to the potential mechanisms of 
white matter disease in CADASIL. In patients, imaging studies
have revealed a decrease in CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity
to CO
2
 or acetazolamide.24 However, reduced CBF was 
observed in patients with tissue lesions and, thus, might occur 
secondary to tissue loss. On the basis of autopsy studies of 
patients with CADASIL, it has been argued that vasoreactivity 
might be compromised as a consequence of arterial stiffening 
or stenosis of small penetrating arteries, particularly in white 
matter.40 Importantly, in old TgPAC-Notch3R169C mutant mice 
with diffuse white matter disease, there is neither stenosis nor 
fibrosis of the arterial wall; additionally, there is no evidence 
of degeneration of vascular muscle, and integrity of the BBB 
is preserved.34 Instead, in vivo and ex vivo functional analyses 
revealed, before the appearance of white matter lesions, cerebrovascular
dysfunction, which includes decreased myogenic 
responses, impaired autoregulation during hypotension, and 
attenuated functional hyperemia.34 Moreover, a mild (10% 
to 20%), diffuse baseline hypoperfusion has been detected 
both in the unaffected gray and white matter in mutant 
mice.34 Another unexpected finding was the discovery of an 
age-dependent reduction in brain capillary density in these 
mice.34 These findings suggest that a key initiating event for 
the development of white matter disease is cerebrovascular 
dysfunction acting in concert with microcirculatory rarefaction
to reduce resting CBF and disrupt diverse vasodilator 
mechanisms. Accordingly, there is evidence that white matter 
is highly vulnerable to moderate chronic hypoperfusion41 and 
may be more vulnerable to cerebrovascular dysfunction.11
Another interesting finding pertains to migraine. In patients 
with CADASIL, the frequency of migraine with aura is 5-times 
higher than in the general population and is usually the first 
clinical manifestation (average age at onset, 30 years), which 
may occur in the absence of any neuroimaging abnormalities.24 Cortical spreading depression (CSD), the electrophysiological
substrate of migraine aura, has been investigated in 
a transgenic mouse model (TgSM22α-hNotch3R90C), which 
develops age-dependent Notch3ECD and GOM deposits but 
no brain tissue lesions. Notably, TgSM22α-hNotch3R90C mice 
overexpress a low amount of mutant human NOTCH3 under 
a smooth muscle–specific promoter.33 These mutant mice 
have a much lower threshold for CSD induction, as well as a 
higher CSD propagation speed.42 In addition to providing an 
explanation for the higher frequency of migraine with aura 
in patients with CADASIL, especially at the very beginning 
of the disease, these results suggest, for the first time to our 
knowledge, a causal link between primary brain vascular 
changes and a CSD phenotype. Such a relationship may be 
specific to CADASIL because the prevalence of migraine 
with aura is not increased in sporadic SVD. The observation 
that CSD susceptibility is unchanged in a mouse model of 
chronic forebrain hypoperfusion, induced by bilateral common
carotid artery stenosis, argues against the involvement 
of hypoperfusion per se in this phenotype.42 Additional studies
are required to determine the precise molecular basis of 
increased CSD susceptibility.
Challenges and New Areas of Investigation
In addition to the identification of additional molecular players
in familial SVD, elucidation of the network of genes/gene 
products by which NOTCH3, COL4A1/2, HTRA1, and TREX1
mutations drive small vessel pathology is clearly an area that 
requires further investigations. The finding of impaired transforming
growth factor-β family signaling in the brain vessels 
of patients with CARASIL43 needs to be further substantiated
, and a causal link with the vascular defects observed in 
CARASIL remains to be established. The molecular mechanisms
of COL4A1/2 pathogenesis are still controversial, specifically
regarding whether vessel changes are because of 
collagen IV haploinsufficiency at the basement membrane44
or intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins into the 
endoplasmic reticulum.45 It is unknown whether cellular 
mislocalization of the mutant TREX1 protein interferes with 
its function.46 Finally, it is still debated whether a reduction 
in NOTCH3 activity might contribute to the CADASIL disease
process.47–49 However, recent studies lend support to a 
Notch3ECD cascade hypothesis in CADASIL disease pathology, 
which proposes that aggregation/accumulation of Notch3ECD is 
a central event, promoting the abnormal recruitment of functionally
important extracellular matrix proteins that ultimately 
cause multifactorial toxicity.32 Given that collagen type IV is a 
core component of the extracellular matrix of brain vessels and 
HTRA1, a serine protease secreted into the extracellular matrix 
of brain vessels (A. Joutel, unpublished), this raises the possibility
that alterations in the matrisome (defined as the ensemble 
of extracellular matrix proteins and associated factors)50 of the 
cerebral microvasculature might be a converging pathogenic 
mechanism underlying several forms of familial SVD.
Genetically engineered mouse models of hereditary SVD 
are still in their infancy. Mouse models of CARASIL and 
retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy need to be

developed, and better CADASIL models that recapitulate the 
full spectrum of the disease are also needed. In addition, there 
are at least 2 aspects in the characterization of existing SVD 
models that have been neglected to this point, namely neuroimaging
and cognitive studies, which are instrumental to the 
definition of markers and consequences of SVD in humans. 
These are clearly areas that require further efforts.
Studies point to a possible loss of normal vascular integrity 
in the pathogenic effects of collagen type IV mutations and to 
early cerebrovascular dysfunction in the pathogenic effects of 
CADASIL-associated NOTCH3 mutations. The identification 
of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved offers great 
promise to develop genetic or pharmacological strategies 
that could reverse the vascular defects in existing COLA41 
and CADASIL mouse models and establish the causal link 
between these vascular alterations and occurrence of brain tissue
lesions. Another question is whether the diversity of tissue
lesions (white matter hyperintensities, small infarctions 
or hemorrhages in the white or deep gray matter, visible perivascular
spaces, and brain atrophy) in SVD reflects a diversity
of underlying mechanisms. Interestingly, a recent study 
demonstrating that the majority of incident lacunes in patients 
with CADASIL develop at the edge of a white matter hyperintensity
raises the possibility that the mechanisms of lacunes 
and white matter hyperintensities are intimately connected in 
CADASIL51 and perhaps other pathologies.
The need for treatment for SVD, coupled with the availability
of mouse models, is fueling interest in developing 
targeted therapeutic approaches. At this point, therapeutic 
opportunities are emerging for CADASIL with the clearance 
of Notch3ECD aggregates or the reduction of mutant NOTCH3 
expression, using, for example, antisense oligonucleotides.
Finally, several lines of evidence indicate that genetic susceptibility
factors contribute to the occurrence of sporadic SVD 
as part of a multifactorial predisposition.52 There is a growing 
appreciation that variants in genes that underlie Mendelian 
diseases may also modulate the risk for complex forms of the 
same disease.53 A recent study suggests that common variants 
of the NOTCH3 gene increase the risk of age-related white 
matter lesions in hypertensive patients.54 Additionally, rare 
coding variants in the COL4A1 and COL4A2 genes, which 
may affect COL4A1 and COL4A2 secretion, have been identified
in a small cohort of patients with sporadic intracerebral 
hemorrhages.55,56 These finding thus support the idea that 
monogenic and common non-Mendelian forms of SVD may 
have similar molecular underpinnings. Specifically, molecular
changes and resulting small vessel pathology that arise in 
Mendelian SVD as a consequence of a single point mutation 
may be produced in sporadic SVD by a combination of vascular
risk factors and altered expression/function of specific 
variants of Mendelian SVD-contributing genes.
In closing, the identification of major genetic causes of 
nonhypertensive adult onset SVD has provided an important 
advancement in the field of SVD, and it is increasingly appreciated
that monogenic forms of adult-onset SVD are invaluable
paradigms for understanding the pathogenesis of SVD. 
Furthermore, it is anticipated that one of the next chapters in 
this field may involve closing the loop between rare familial 
SVD and common sporadic SVD.
