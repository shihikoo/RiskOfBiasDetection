Methods
and results
Ischaemia/reperfusion brain injury was induced by performing a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery on
wild-type mice. After the ischaemic episode and upon reperfusion, small interfering RNA targeting p66Shcwas injected
intravenously. We observed that post-ischaemic p66Shc knockdown preserved blood–brain barrier integrity that
resulted in improved stroke outcome, as identified by smaller lesion volumes, decreased neurological deficits, and
increased survival. Experiments on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells demonstrated that silencing
of the adaptor protein p66Shcpreserves claudin-5 protein levels during hypoxia/reoxygenation by reducing nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species production. Further, we found that in peripheral
blood monocytes of acute ischaemic stroke patients p66Shcgene expression is transiently increased and that this
increase correlates with short-term neurological outcome.
Conclusion Post-ischaemic silencing of p66Shc upon reperfusion improves stroke outcome in mice while the expression of p66Shc
gene correlates with short-term outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke.

experiments are not directly relevant to the experiments performed in mice and in human endothelial cells, they provide novel important
information about p66Shc regulation in stroke patients and set the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the potential for
p66Shcto become a novel therapeutic target as an adjunct of thrombolysis for the management of acute ischaemic stroke.
Introduction
Stroke is associated with major disabilities and mortality.1 Although
over the last decades several novel experimental neuroprotective
strategies have been developed,2 their translation into clinical practice
has proven difficult.3,4 Thus, the search for novel therapeutic
targets for ischaemic stroke as an adjunct to thrombolysis remains
an unmet clinical need.
Although ischaemic stroke is amenable to thrombolysis in patients
presenting early after symptom onset,5 vascular leakage and the
ensuing oedema formation during reperfusion contributes importantly
to neurological deficits.6 Cerebral microvascular endothelial
cells are a main component of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)7
which divides the cerebral circulation from brain tissue. These cells
are interconnected by tight and adherens junction proteins7 whose
integrity is critical for stroke outcome.8 Indeed, disruption of the
BBB following ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) leads to vascular leakage
and infiltration of plasma components into the brain tissue leading
tooedemaandfurtherorgandamage.9–11Overproductionofreactive
oxygen species (ROS) following I/R is considered a key mechanism
leading to BBB damage.12 p66Shc, an isoform of the mammalian
adaptor protein Shc,13,14 is a crucial mediator of ROS production in
several disease states15–18thereby leading to cellular apoptosis.19–21
Indeed, much of the vasculoprotective properties observed by
genetic deletion of p66Shcin mice are the result of reduced oxidative
stress and in turn preserved endothelial function.15–17
Inlinewiththeabove,wepreviouslydemonstratedthatmicelacking
p66Shcdevelop smaller stroke size following I/R.22However, the clinical
relevanceofthisobservation remains unknownand the underlying
molecular mechanisms poorly understood. To this end, we subjected
mice to I/R brain injury and, to mimic real life clinical conditions as it
would occur in the context of thrombolysis, we performed p66Shc
silencinginvivousingsmallinterferingRNA(siRNA)aftertheischaemic
episode and upon reperfusion. Additionally, we mimicked I/R conditions
in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells
(HBMECs) by exposing them to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) with
and without silencing of p66Shc and assessed the production of ROS
as well as the levels of tight and adherens junction proteins. Finally,
we studied p66Shc gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes
(PBMs) of patients with acute ischaemic stroke and correlated it to
the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).
Methods
Patients
Twenty-seven patients admitted to the emergency room of San Raffaele
Hospital (OSR, Milan, Italy) with a diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke
presenting within 6 h from symptom onset were enrolled. Five patients
presentedwake-upstrokeandwererecruitedwithin6 hfromawakening.
The initial diagnosis was based on clinical history, neurological
examination(conductedbycertifiedneurologists),andabraincomputed
tomography (CT) scan. Nineteen sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers
(either relatives or visitors of in-hospital patients), with a negative
history of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, were included as controls.
Patients diagnosed with diabetes, systemic inflammatory diseases,
acute infections, and malignancy were excluded, to eliminate potential
interference of those disease states on p66Shc expression.23 Blood was
withdrawn from the antecubital vein at 6 and 24 h after initial stroke
symptoms (for stroke patients), whereas control subjects donated
blood once.
Of the 27 ischaemic stroke patients, 14 received thrombolytic treatment
within 4.5 h from initial stroke symptoms onset. Ischaemic
strokes were clinically classified according to the Oxford Community
Stroke Project classification (also known as the Bamford or OXFORD
classification).24 Stroke aetiology was classified according to the Trial
of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria.25 Moreover, stroke
severity was assessed, using NIHSS on admission and at discharge. Furthermore
, delta NIHSS was calculated as the difference between the
NIHSS presented at discharge and the NIHSS presented at admission
(deltaNIHSS¼ NIHSS discharge2 NIHSS admission);thereby,positive
valuesindicateshort-termneurologicworseningwhilenegativevaluesindicate
neurological improvement.
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at San Raffaele
Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. All participants (or their representative
relatives) signed a written informed consent to authorize the treatment
of their biological and clinical data.
Isolation of peripheral blood monocytes
Peripheral blood monocytes from whole blood were isolated using
anti-CD14-coatedMicroBeads(MiltenyiBiotec)onamagneticseparator
(Miltenyi Biotec), as previously described.26
Animals
All animal experiments were performed on male, 11–13-week-old wildtype
(wt) (C57/BL6J) mice. Study design and experimental protocols
were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of the Canton of
Zurich.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
A transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) surgery
was performed on wt mice to induce I/R brain injury, as described.22 In
brief, anaesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane in oxygen-enriched
air and mice were kept under 1.5% isoflurane anaesthesia during
MCAO surgery. Body temperature was controlled by using a warm
water heating pad. Incision site was infiltrated with 0.5% bupivacaine solution
for pain relief. A 6-0 silicone-coated filament (Doccol Corporation
) was advanced into the internal carotid artery (ICA) until the
thread occluded the origin of the left MCA to induce unilateral MCAO.
After 45 min (60 min for evaluation of long-term effect) of ischaemia,
the thread was removed to allow reperfusion of the MCA. After
wound care and before returning to their standard cage, mice were
kept for 1.5 h in a temperature controlled cage. For sham operation,
the filament was advanced into the ICA without occluding the MCA.

In vivo p66Shc silencing
In vivop66Shcsilencing was performed as described.27Briefly, 1.6 nmol of
predesigned siRNA targeting p66Shc was incubated with a mixture of
150 mmol/L NaCl solution-jetPEIw and injected intravenously into the
tail vein of the wt mouse randomized. Scrambled siRNA was used as a
negative control. Detailed methods are provided in Supplementary
material online.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Lesion development was monitored after MCAO on a Bruker PharmaS-
can 47/16 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH) operating at 4.7 T. Anaesthesia was
induced using 3% isoflurane (Abbott) in a 4 : 1 air–oxygen mixture.
During MRI acquisition, mice were kept under isoflurane anaesthesia
(1.5%). During the scan session, body temperature was monitored with
a rectal temperature probe (MLT415, ADInstruments) and kept at
36+0.558C using a warm water circuit integrated into the animal
support (Bruker BioSpin GmbH). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
recordings were done in a blinded way by an independent person.
The lesion was determined on maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted images as areas of significant
reduction of the ADC compared with the unaffected,
contralateral side. The lesion in the T2-weighted image was determined
as hyperintense areas compared with the contralateral hemisphere.
Lesion volumes were quantified blinded by drawing regions of interest
around the areas of reduced ADC and hyperintensities in T2-weighted
images in five MRI slices using an ROI tool (Paravision, Bruker). Brain
infarct volumes were calculated by summing the volumes of each
section and correcting for brain swelling, as described.28 Detailed
methods are provided in Supplementary material online.
Neurological deficits measurement
Neurological status was assessed using an adapted four-point scale test
based on Bederson et al.29 and was graded as previously described22:
Grade 0: normal neurological function; Grade 1: forelimb flexion;
Grade 2: circling; Grade 3: leaning to the contralateral side at rest;
Grade 4: no spontaneous motor activity. Motor performance was
assessed using the RotaRod test. Mice were placed on a rotating rod
with increasing speed (4–44 revolutions/min; circumference of the
rod: 9 cm) and the latency to fall was measured. The experimental trail
was ended if the maximum rotation speed was achieved or if the
mousefellofftherod.Pertimepoint,threetestrunspermousewereperformedandthebestrunwasincludedinthestatistics.Neurologicaldeficit
measurements were performed in a blinded way.
Evaluation of long-term effect
Long-term effect of post-ischaemicin vivop66Shcsilencing on stroke was
assessed up to 6 days. The well-being of mice during the experimental
periodwasdeterminedusingascoresheetthatwasapprovedbytheCantonal
Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich. This score sheet was
used to define survival/death of an animal. Death events include spontaneous
deaths (4 of 16 for siScr stroke mice and 3 of 15 for sip66Shcstroke
mice) and mice which did not fulfil the health evaluation criteria.
Evans blue extravasation
Determination of BBB permeability after MCAO was done by evaluating
Evans blue extravasation, as described.30Detailed methods are provided
in Supplementary material online.
Immunofluorescence staining
Frozen brains were cut into 6mm thick slices on a cryostat (Leica Cm
1900). Immunofluorescent analysis was performed as described.31
Briefly, brain slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated
with primary and secondary antibodies. Images were taken using a
Leica Dm4000 B microscope. Stained area of claudin-5, vascular endothelial
(VE)-cadherin, or occludin was measured using ImageJ Software
and normalized to the total endothelial cell surface (assessed by isolectin
B
4
staining). Detailed methods are provided in Supplementary material
online.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription
Total RNA isolation and preparation of cDNA was performed as previously
described.26 Total RNA of PBM, or of MCA, was extracted using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms (MCA) or 1mg (PBM)
of RNA was reverse transcribed using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-
Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences) and first-strand random cDNA
primers pd(N)6 (TaKaRa).
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Determination of p66Shc gene expression was done as previously
described.26 Detailed methods are provided in Supplementary material
online.
Cell culture experiments
Primary HBMECs (Cell Systems) were cultured in EBM-2 medium supplied
with EGM-2 bullet kit (Lonza). Adhering cells (passages 5–9)
were grown to confluence and exposed to hypoxia (0.2% oxygen) for
4 h, followed or not by 4 h of incubation in a normoxic incubator (reoxygenation
). Hypoxia was induced using a gas-controlled glove box
(Invivo2 400, Ruskinn Technologies). In certain experiments, cells were
pre-incubated with apocynin (0.1 mmol/L) (SAFC) for 1 h. Thereafter,
HBMECs were harvested for measuring superoxide anion (O−
2
) production
, nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity or immunoblot analysis.
Small interfering RNA transfection in human
brain microvascular endothelial cells
Human brain microvascular endothelial cells were incubated with predesigned
siRNA targeting p66Shc at final concentration of 25 nmol/L using
lipofectaminewRNAiMAXReagent(Invitrogen),aspreviouslydescribed.32
Detailed methods are provided in Supplementary material online.
Immunoblotting

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for comparison of two groups was performed using
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, or Mann–Whitney test, when appropriate.
For comparison of more than two unmatched groups,
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post
hoc test, or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test, when
appropriate, was performed. For comparison of groups with repeated
measures, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was
applied. Statistical analysis for survival studies was performed using
log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to
test the correlation between two quantitative variables, and Fisher’s
exact test for comparison of categorical data between study subjects.
Two-sided P-values were calculated and P, 0.05 denoted a significant
difference. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prismw
software 5.01.
Results
In vivo post-ischaemic silencing of p66Shc
reduces lesion volumes and improves
functional outcome following I/R brain
injury
To study the effect of post-ischaemic p66Shcsilencing on stroke, a transient
MCAO surgery was performed on wt mice to induce I/R brain
injury. To analyse p66Shcsilencing efficiency in vivo beforehand, p66Shc
mRNA and protein levels were quantified in cerebral arteries (MCA
and basilar artery, respectively). Intravenous injection of siRNA
against p66Shc reduced mRNA and protein p66Shc levels within 48 h
after injection compared with siScr injection (Figure1AandB). To localize
the distribution of the p66ShcsiRNA within brain cerebral arteries,
wt mice were injected with fluorescence dye-labelled p66Shc siRNA
(Alexa546-sip66Shc).Flowcytometrywithwholebraindigestsrevealed
a predominant uptake of the siRNA by the brain endothelium. We
observed that 21.2% of brain endothelial cells (CD452CD31+)
showed a positive signal for Alexa546-tagged p66Shc siRNA
(Figure 1F) while only 0.6% of leukocytes (CD45+CD312)( Figure 1G)
and 0.2% of other nucleated cells (CD452CD312)( Figure 1H)were
positive for the Alexa546 signal. Negative control was stained with
Hoechst 33342 to label nucleated cells (Figure 1L–N).
Lesion volumes in sip66Shc and siScr injected stroke mice were
quantified with MRI. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) denoted
matching baseline lesion sizes in both groups after 45 min of ischaemia
and directly upon reperfusion (Figure 2B). At 48 h post-MCAO,
both DWI and T2-weighted imaging displayed instead a reduced
stroke volume in sip66Shc stroke mice when compared with siScr
stroke mice (Figure 2Band C).
Neurological deficits after MCAO were assessed using two different
tests. Pre-MCAO, both sip66Shc and siScr stroke mice showed

comparable performance in the RotaRod test and on the four-point
scale test based on Bedersonet al.29(Figure2DandE). At 24 h post-
MCAO, we observed in both groups a reduced latency to fall in
the RotaRod test. However, at 48 h post-MCAO, sip66Shc stroke
mice showed a significant higher persistence on the rotating drum
compared with siScr stroke mice (Figure2D). In line with that, neurological
deficits assessed with the scale test were significantly lower
in sip66Shc stroke mice compared with siScr stroke mice at 48 h
post-MCAO (Figure 2E). All sham operated animas displayed
normal neurological functions throughout the experimental period
(Figure 2Dand data not shown).
By analysing the impact of p66Shcsilencing on stroke up to 6 days,
we found an improved survival of sip66Shc stroke mice when compared
with siScr stroke mice (Figure 2F, 31.25% survival for siScr
stroke mice vs. 66.66% for sip66Shc stroke mice). Survival was
assessed in accordance to the health evaluation criteria approved
by the Cantonal Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich; all
shamoperatedanimalssurvivedandfulfilledthehealthevaluationcriteria
(data not shown).
In vivo p66Shc silencing preserves
blood–brain barrier integrity after I/R
brain injury
The BBB plays a critical role for the outcome of stroke,8 and its
permeability can be assessed in vivo by quantifying Evans blue
extravasation.9,30 We tested whether post-ischaemic p66Shc
silencing preserves BBB permeability after I/R brain injury in mice.
Indeed, 48 h post-MCAO p66Shc silencing reduced Evans blue extravasation
when compared with mice receiving siScr (Figure 3A).
Blood–brain barrier permeability is regulated by tight and adherensjunctional
proteinsconnecting cerebralmicrovascularendothelial
cells.35 Thus, we analysed the integrity of tight and adherens
junctions following I/R brain injury focusing on claudin-5, occludin,
and VE-cadherin. Immunofluorescence staining of claudin-5 on
coronal brain sections of siScr-treated stroke mice revealed
decreased claudin-5-positive stained areas normalized to the total
endothelial surface (measured by isolectin B
4
staining31,36) in the ipsilateral
hemisphere compared with the contralateral hemisphere
(Figure 3B), while this disruption of claudin-5 integrity was not
observed in stroke mice receiving sip66Shc (Figure 3B). Unlike
claudin-5, occludin and VE-cadherin-positive stained areas were
not changed following I/R brain injury in both experimental groups
(data not shown).
Role of p66Shc in H/R in primary human
brain microvascular endothelial cells
In order to characterize the molecular regulation of claudin-5 by
p66Shc and to translate our in vivo murine data to human cells, we
exposed HBMECs to hypoxia (H) alone, or hypoxia followed by
reoxygenation (H/R). Exposure of HBMECs to hypoxia neither
altered phosphorylation of p66Shc at Ser36, a critical step for its
pro-apoptotic37and pro-oxidant activity,21nor total p66Shcprotein

exposure to H/R increased phosphorylation of p66Shcat Ser36 compared
with normoxia (Figure 4B). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a

(Figure 4A). Reactive oxygen species and NO are critical for
endothelial function20 and have been implicated in vascular permeability.12 Here, we analysed whether H/R regulates O−
2
production
and NO bioavailability, and whether p66Shc mediates these effects.
Exposure of HBMECs to H/R led to an increased O−
2
production
(Figure4D) and a decreased NO bioavailability (Figure4E) compared
with normoxia. However, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation
at both sites studied (Ser1177 and Thr495) and eNOS
protein expression remained unchanged (Figure 4F and G). Preincubation
of HBMECs with p66Shc siRNA, but not scrambled
siRNA, reduced the increased O−
2
production (Figure 4D) and
increased the reduced NO bioavailability during H/R (Figure 4E).
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase is considered
as a major source of vascular O−

,38 and is a downstream target of
p66Shc.34,39 Moreover, NADPH oxidase was demonstrated to play
a dominant role in ROS production in brain endothelial cells
exposed to H/R.40 Thus, we investigated whether during H/R
NADPH oxidase is a source of O−
2
production downstream of
p66Shc. Indeed, NADPH oxidase activity was increased after exposure
to H/R, and returned to control levels after silencing of p66Shc
(Figure 4H).
Effect of p66Shc and reactive oxygen
species on claudin-5 in vitro
Human brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to H/R exhibited
reduced protein levels of claudin-5 compared with normoxia
(Figure 5A). In contrast, occludin and VE-cadherin protein levels
were not affected by exposure to H/R (Figure 5B and C). After
both, pre-incubation of HBMECs with p66Shc siRNA and with the
antioxidant apocynin41 claudin-5 levels were elevated under H/R
condition (Figure 5Dand E).

p66Shc gene expression is increased
in patients with ischaemic stroke and
correlates to neurological outcome
To provide evidence for a role of p66Shcin human ischaemic stroke,
we analysed p66Shc expression in PBMs of patients with ischaemic
stroke. A total of 27 ischaemic stroke patients and 19 age- and sexmatched
, healthy control subjects wererecruited. Clinical characteristicsofbothgroupsdidnotdifferstatistically
(Table1).p66ShcmRNA
levels were significantly increased 6 h after initial stroke symptoms
(Figure 6A) and returned to control levels 24 h thereafter
(Figure 6A). Of note, p66Shc gene expression at 6 h was comparable
in patients with ischaemic stroke regardless of whether they had
receivedthrombolytic treatment or not (Figure6B). p66Shctranscript
levels of all studysubjects positively correlatedwith neurological deficits
at admission, measured according to the NIHSS (Figure 6C). Importantly
, while p66Shcgene expression of stroke patients which did
not receive thrombolytic intervention did not correlate with shortterm
neurological outcome (NIHSS discharge2 NIHSS admission)
(Figure 6D), it positively correlated in stroke patients treated with
thrombolysis (Figure 6E).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that post-ischaemic
p66Shc silencing reduces brain injury by preserving BBB integrity by
preventing claudin-5 level downregulation. The in vivo findings in
the mouse were translated to HBMECs exposed to H/R where
p66Shc was phosphorylated at Ser36 leading to the reduction in
claudin-5 levels via activation of the NADPH oxidase and increased
ROS production. Further, we show that p66Shc expression is
increased in PBMs of patients with ischaemic stroke within 6 h
from onset of symptoms and that p66Shcgene expression correlates
to short-term neurological outcome.
In mice, we recently showed that constitutive genetic deletion of
p66Shc reduces early stroke size and neurological deficits following
I/R brain injury.22However, the mechanisms of this effect and its clinical
relevance remained elusive. Furthermore, the use of constitutive

knockout animals only serves as a proof-of-principle and does not
allowdelineation of therapeutic timewindows as requiredin the clinical
setting. In contrast, RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategies
allow to modify the expression of a certain target at the posttranscriptional
level, thus making it therapeutically interesting.42
Indeed, several RNAi-based strategies are under investigation in clinical
trials.43 Here, we used a clinically relevant experimental setup
with siRNA delivery upon reperfusion to reduce p66Shc levels.
Reperfusion of an occluded vessel allows reoxygenation of the ischaemic
area which promotes recovery of penumbral areas.44
Nevertheless paradoxically, re-introduction of oxygen in a previouslyischaemicareaalsocausesasurgeinfreeradicalgeneration11which
interfereswiththerecoveryprocesses.Indeed,wedemonstratehere
that silencing of the pro-oxidant p66Shc after the ischaemic episode
and upon reperfusion, as it would be the case in stroke patients presenting
at the emergency room undergoing thrombolytic treatment,
reduceslesionvolume,improvesneurologicalfunction,andincreases
survival. These data highlight the potential of p66Shc as novel therapeutic
target in stroke patients undergoing thrombolysis.
Given the key role of BBB permeability in determining stroke
outcome,6we characterized its integrity by analysing Evans blue extravasation
, a known indicator for vascular leakage.9,30,31,45 Indeed,
and in line with the improved stroke outcome in the sip66Shc
stroke mice, BBB disruption was blunted after p66Shcsilencing compared
with control mice. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells
connected via tight and adherens junctional proteins make up the
BBB.7 A disruption of this tightly regulated structure is known to
occur in I/R brain injury and is responsible for vascular leakage and
in turnoedemaformation.9–11To investigatethe molecularmechanisms
by which p66ShcpreservesBBBintegrityafterI/R braininjury,we
focused in vivo as well as in vitro on claudin-5, occludin and
VE-cadherin, three major junctional proteins.7 Consistently, we

found less reduction in claudin-5 levels after silencing of p66Shc.In
contrast, occludin and VE-cadherin levels remained unaltered in
both experimental settings. Our data obtained on murine as well as
primary human cells indicate that p66Shc mediates BBB disruption by
acting specifically on claudin-5 rather than occludin and VE-cadherin.
To characterize the molecular regulation of claudin-5 by p66Shc,
weexposedprimaryHBMECstoH/R,tomimicinvivosettings.Exposure
of HBMECs to H/R, but not to hypoxia, increased phosphorylation
of p66Shc at Ser36 confirming previous data in renal tubular
epithelial cells.46 Together with our in vivo data, these results
suggest that p66Shc is mainly involved in mediating its deleterious
effects during reperfusion, rather than during ischaemia. Endothelial
ROS production and NO bioavailability are both critical for I/
R-induced alteration in BBB permeability and stroke outcome12,47
and ROS are known to influence claudin-5 levels in brain endothelial
cells.48Here,wedemonstrateinvitroevidencethatendothelialp66Shc
silencing in H/R preserves NO bioavailability, reduces NADPH
oxidase activation, and decreases ROS generation thus blunting the
reductioninclaudin-5levels.Thispathwaymaybealsorelevantinvivo.
To study p66Shcgene regulation in stroke patients, we performed
proof-of-principle experiments assessing its expression in PBMs of
acute ischaemic stroke patients. Although it would be of particular
interest and relevance to elucidate the role of cerebrovascular
p66Shc in stroke patients, sample collection in humans would prove
extremely difficult thus, we selected PBMs since those are easily obtainable
from whole blood and could still give us interesting insights
into gene expression changes. Here we found that p66Shc mRNA
levels were increased 6 h after initial stroke symptoms and then
returned to basal levels at 24 h. Moreover, p66Shc expression at 6 h
correlated to short-term neurological outcome (delta NIHSS) in
stroke patients. Interestingly, delta NIHSS correlated to p66Shc
expression only in patients undergoing thrombolysis, but not in
those without. Although thrombolysis is known to improve neurological
outcome after stroke,5 it is also associated with early
reperfusion-induced BBB damage49 which is known to be mediated
by ROS and affects stroke outcome.6An increased vascular leakage
also favours the accumulation of blood circulating cells in brain
tissue thus causing tissue damage via production of free radicals.11,50
This could explain why the correlation between neurological
outcome and p66Shc expression is found only in thrombolytic
patients where monocytic p66Shc-induced ROS production and
the consequent damage is likely more pronounced. In contrast, in
patients not undergoing thrombolysis, the role of reperfusioninduced
ROS-dependent injury is less prominent and thus neurological
damage is less likely to be dependent on p66Shc-mediated
ROS.
