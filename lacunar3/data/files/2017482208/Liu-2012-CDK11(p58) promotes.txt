Abstract In response to a variety of neural damages in
the CNS, quiescent astrocytes become reactive astrocytes.
Astrocytes are the major glial subtype and are important
effectors that participate in the pathogenesis of numerous
neural disorders, including trauma, stroke, aging, and
developmental, genetic, idiopathic or acquired neurodegenerative
diseases. CDK11p58 (Cyclin-dependent kinases
11 protein 58/PITSLRE) is a p34cdc2-related protein
kinase that plays an important role in normal cell cycle
progression. In the process of LPS stimulus, the expression
of CDK11p58 in astrocytes was increased. Induced
CDK11p58 was parallel to astrocyte inflammatory response.
Knockdown of CDK11p58 by small-interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) reduced the LPS-induced astrocyte inflammatory
response, while overexpression CDK11p58 enhanced the
process. CDK11p58 exerted its functions via activating p38
and JNK MAPK pathways. This study delineates that
CDK11p58 may be a significant regulatory factor for host
defenses in central nervous system (CNS) inflammation.
Keywords CDK11p58  Astrocyte  Lipopolysaccharide
Introduction
Astrocytes, the predominant type of glial cells in the CNS,
form a highly organized multicellular syncytium extending
throughout the brain cortex [1, 2]. Traumatic injury to the
adult CNS results in a rapid inflammatory response by the
resident astrocytes, characterized mainly by hypertrophy,
proliferation, and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) expression, resulting in astrogliosis [3–6]. Astrogliosis
is a complex phenomenon that includes a mixture of
positive and negative responses for neuronal survival and
regeneration. Astroglia maintain the integrity of the blood–
brain barrier and may contribute to protect the damaged
neural tissue but may also prevent axonal regeneration and
increase local inflammation [7–10]. The identification of
factors that regulate reactive astrogliosis is of practical
interest for the development of therapeutic strategies to
reduce neural damage and promote regeneration after CNS
injuries and decrease neuronal death in neurodegenerative
disorders. Our studies aim to determine whether CDK11p58
plays a regulatory role in astrocytes inflammatory response
induced by LPS.
CDK11p58 is a Ser/Thr kinase and belongs to CDK11
family which has three main identified isoforms CDK11p110,
CDK11p58 and CDK11p46 [11]. CDK11p110 is a 110 kD
protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all cell cycles and
functions in transcription and RNA processing [12].
CDK11p58 is a G2/M specific protein kinase and is translated
from the same mRNA as CDK11p110 by a CAP-independent
translation mechanism through targeting an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) [13]. Thus, CDK11p58 kinase activity
achieves its peak during the onset of mitosis. CDK11p58 is
associated with cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, and
proapoptotic signaling. It is also required for the maintenance
of chromosome cohesion, the formation of bipolar

spindle, and the completion of mitosis [14]. CDK11p58 is
co-expressed with astrocytes, which proceeded proliferation
following CNS injury [15]. Co-localization of CDK11 and
PCNA was found in the spinal cord after injury [16]. Niu
et al. [17] showed CDK11p58 protein was highly expressed in
spermatogonia, which underwent rapid cell proliferation in
the developing testes. Whether CDK11p58 is involved in the
regulation of inflammatory response of astrocytes is still
unclear.
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-
terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/
SAPK), and p38 MAPK are central components of signal
transduction pathways in the regulation of cell proliferation
and differentiation, cytokine production, and apoptosis [18].
JNK and p38 are potently induced by proinflammatory
cytokines, bacterial endotoxins, and environmental stresses
[18, 19]. Previous research suggested that activating JNK
and p38 pathway had an important role in astrocyte inflammatory
response. However, little is known about whether
activating JNK and p38 pathway is associated with
CDK11p58 regulating astrocyte inflammatory response.
In this study, we investigated quantitative and temporal
patterns of CDK11p58 expression in rat primary astrocytes
after LPS stimulus. We have determined that CDK11p58
plays a positive role in the regulation of astrocyte inflammatory
response. CDK11p58 appears to promote the activation
of p38 and JNK during LPS-induced astrocyte
inflammatory response. Our result indicated a possible role
of CDK11p58 during inflammatory process in the CNS.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Antibodies
LPS, monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies
were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis,
MO). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PITSLRE, anti-GAPDH,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
and HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse antiiNOS
, rabbit anti- phospho p38, rabbit anti- total p38,
rabbit anti- phospho JNK, rabbit anti- total JNK antibodies
were from Sigma. All reagents were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted.
Astrocyte Cultures and Cell Treatment
Astrocytes were prepared from the brains of 1–2-day-old
neonatal Sprague–Dawley rat pups as previously described.
Briefly, the rat pups were killed by decapitation and brains
rapidly removed. The cerebral cortices were trypsinized,
dissociated by gentle trituration, and plated at a density of
5 9 107 cells per 75 cm2 flask in Dulbecco’s modified
essential medium (DMEM) with nutrient mixture F12 (1:1
v/v, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% heatinactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained
in the complete culture medium for 7–8 days.
Between the 9th and 12th day, the cultures were shaken to
remove the top layer of cells that sat on top of the astroglial
monolayer. Prior to experimental treatments, cultures of
astrocytes were passaged twice. Culture medium was
switched to serum-free DMEM/F12 culture medium and
experiments were initiated 24 h later. To investigate the
effect of lipopolysaccharide on CDK11p58 expression, cells
were allowed to reach 80% confluence. The reagents were
administered directly into growth media for the indicated
incubation times. Non-treated cells were included as controls
in all experiments. In this culture, more than 98% of
the cells were identified as type I astrocytes by positiveactivity
for GFAP and by flattened, polygonal appearance.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were thoroughly scraped from the culture dishes with
a cell scraper, Lysates were homogenized for 10 s at
6,000 rpm in a homogenizer (Brinkman). Protein content
was normalized using protein assay kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories
). The samples were subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis followed by transfer onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Immobilon,
Millipore). The filters were incubated in PBS containing
0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 5% non fat milk and then
with anti-PITSLRE antibody (1:1,000), anti-iNOS antibody
(1:1,000), anti-phospho p38 antibody (1:1,000) anti-total
p38 antibody (1:1,000), anti-phospho JNK antibody
(1:1,000), anti-total JNK antibody (1:1,000), anti-GAPDH
antibody (1:1,000) overnight at 4C. After being incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(1:5,000). Blots were washed and immunoreactive proteins
were visualized on a film with an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA,
USA). Optical density on the film was measured with a
computer imaging system (Imaging Technology, ON,
Canada) and the relative differences between control and
treatment groups were calculated and expressed as relative
increases setting control as 1. Values are responsible for at
least three independent reactions.
RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) Analysis
Total RNA of astrocytes was extracted using TRIZOL
reagent (Gibco-BRL). Integrity of RNA was checked by

agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
One microgram of RNA was used as a template for each
reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The reverse transcription
step was carried using RevertAid First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Primer sequences used
in this report were listed as follows: CDK11: sense
50-GAAGAAGTTGGTGAAGGGAC-30 and antisense
50-TGACGGTGACGATGTTGG-30; expected product:
338 base pairs. PCR amplification was carried out with an
initial denaturing step at 94C for 5 min, then 30 cycles at
94C for 45 s, at 58C for 45 s and at 72C for 45 s, and a
further extension at 72C for 10 min. Gels were visualized
under UV light and photographed, and optical densities of
the bands were analyzed with molecular dynamics densitometer
(Scion). The relative differences in expression
between groups were expressed using optical density normalized
with GAPDH, and the relative differences between
control and treatment groups were calculated and expressed
as relative increases. Values are responsible for at least
three independent experiments.
Cytokine Measurements
The concentrations of TNF-a in culture supernatant were
determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (Biosource Europe, SA). The detection limits
of the assays were determined to be 15 pg/ml. The assays
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Proliferation Monitored by Flow Cytometry
Cultured and stimulated cells were collected and fixed in
70% ethanol for 30 min. After washing with PBS and
treatment with Rnase A (50 lg/ml in Phosphate Buffered
Saline, Sigma, USA) for 30 min, the cells were incubated
with propidium iodide (50 lg/ml, Sigma, USA) for 15 min
and analyzed by the flow cytometry machine (BECKMANCOULTER
Co., USA). All the data were analyzed by the
research software. In the DNA histogram, the amplitude of
sub-SDNA peak represents the number of proliferative
cells.
siRNAs, Plasmid CDK11p58 and Transfection
Double-stranded RNAs of 19 nucleotides were synthesized
by Ambion Research. The targeting sequence of rat
CDK11p58 mRNA (50-AGACCCAAATCTTTTGCGGAG
GTT-30) corresponds to the region 1306–1326, relative to
the first nucleotide of the start codon (GenBank Accession
No. NM_145766.1). Nonsilencing control siRNA is an
irrelevant siRNA with random nucleotides and no known
specificity. Transfection of rat primary astrocytes with
duplex synthetic siRNA was performed using lifectamine
2000 reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For mock transfection, all procedures listed
above were performed in the absence of siRNA duplex. For
transient transfection, the CDK11p58 expression vector, the
non-specific vector were carried out using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) and plus reagent in OptiMEM (Invitrogen
) as suggested by the manufacturer. Transfected cells
were used for the subsequent experiments 48 h after
transfection.
Statistical Analysis
The density of specific bands was measured with a computer-assisted
image-analysis system (Adobe Systems, San
Jose, CA, USA) and normalized against GAPDH level.
Differences between the control and treatment groups were
calculated and expressed as relative increases setting the
control as 1. At least three repetitive assessments were
performed, and for each assessment, all groups were tested
in quadruplicate. All data were given in terms of relative
values and expressed as mean ± standard error. One-way
ANOVA was used to compare differences between the
operated groups and the control group. All statistical
analyses were conducted with a STATA 7.0 software
package (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), and all
significance levels were set at P\ 0.05.

CDK11p58 Expression in LPS Stimulus Primary
Astrocytes According to Different Dose and Time
Parallel to Astrocyte Inflammatory Response
Rat primary astrocytes were treated with various concentrations
of LPS (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 lg/ml) for 9 h.
Using Western blot, we examined the CDK11p110,
CDK11p58 and iNOS protein levels. The iNOS levels
(Fig. 1a) increased at 0.1 lg/ml and gradually peaked at
10 lg/ml of LPS. In the activated astrocytes, the expression
of CDK11p58 gradually increased in accord with that of
iNOS, peaked at 10 lg/ml. Significant expression was
observed at 1 and 10 lg/ml LPS (*P\ 0.05). CDK11p110
did not change significantly (Fig. 1a). To examine more
detailed temporal pattern of CDK11, RT-PCR analysis was
performed. CDK11 mRNA also underwent a similar
expression pattern as CDK11p58 protein following LPS
stimulus (Fig. 1b). To further assess whether CDK11p58 is
related to astrocyte inflammatory response, we examine
TNF-a (Fig. 1c) secretion in astrocytic conditioned medium
by ELISA, showing that TNF-a secretion also increase in a
dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry shows that ratio of
G0/G1 phase gradually decreased, while S phase increased

in a dose-dependent manner. Astrocyte proliferation index
changed according to LPS concentration (Fig. 1d). All
results above imply the relationship between CDK11p58 and
astrocyte inflammatory response caused by LPS.
To further study time course of CDK11p58 expression,
we treated primary astrocytes with 10 lg/ml LPS for different
time (0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 h). Western blot
analysis showed iNOS levels (Fig. 2a) increased at 1 h and
reached peak at 9 h. CDK11p58 protein level was low in
control group (0 h). In the activated astrocytes, the
expression of CDK11p58 gradually increased in accord with
that of iNOS. It rose at 3 h post-stimulus and peaked at 9 h,
then declined at 12 h. However, CDK11p110 expression
was almost constant among different time groups (Fig. 2a).
To examine more detailed temporal pattern of CDK11, RTPCR
analysis was performed. CDK11 mRNA also underwent
a similar expression pattern as CDK11p58 protein
following LPS stimulus (Fig. 2b). These results suggest
that upregulation of CDK11p58 but not CDK11p110
expression was correlated with astrocyte inflammatory

response after LPS stimulus. To thorough question whether
CDK11p58 is related to astrocyte inflammatory response,
we examine TNF-a secretion in the conditioned medium by
ELISA, showing that TNF-a secretion (Fig. 2c) also altered
in a time-dependent manner. TNF-a secretion were low in
control group (0 h) and gradually upregulated in a timedependent
manner after LPS stimulation. It rose at 3 h
post-stimulus and reached the peak at 9 h (*P\ 0.05), then
declined at 12 h. Flow cytometry analysis showed S phase
and proliferation index of astrocytes was variable in a timedependent
manner, gradually increasing from 1 h, peaking
at 9 h, then descending (Fig. 2d). From these data, we
conclude there is a relationship between CDK11p58 and
astrocyte inflammatory response after LPS stimulus.

inflammatory response induced by LPS, we transiently

silenced and overexpressed CDK11p58 respectively, to
study its effects on iNOS expression, TNF-a secretion and
cell cycle.
CDK11p58-siRNA, control negative siRNA were tested
48 h post-transfection. As predicted, siRNA knocked down
the protein expression of CDK11p58 to 37% and mRNA to
47%, compared with control astrocytes (Fig. 3a, b). To
judge the relationship between CDK11p58 and astrocyte
inflammatory response, we examine iNOS protein expression
by western blot with or without LPS stimulus after
CDK11p58 gene silencing. After treating CDK11p58-
knockdown astrocytes with LPS (10 lg/ml) for 9 h, iNOS
expression decreased markedly (Fig. 3c). Rat astrocytes
treated with CDK11p58-siRNA were then exposed to
(10 lg/ml) or unexposed to LPS for 9 h, and TNF-a biosynthesis
was measured. After treating CDK11p58-knockdown
astrocytes with LPS (10 lg/ml) for 9 h, TNF-a
production (Fig. 3d) decreased remarkably. Flow cytometry
shows CDK11p58-knockdown astrocytes had a less
number in G2 and S phase (40.38%) than control group
(47.07%). The ratio of S phase increased after LPS stimulation
in control groups, but almost unchanged even poststimulus
in CDK11p58-knockdown astrocytes (Fig. 3e).
Astrocyte proliferation index decreased along with
CDK11p58 knock-down after LPS stimulus, compared with
control group (Fig. 3e). These results suggested that
CDK11p58 can upregulate astrocyte inflammatory response
induced by LPS.
After CDK11p58 overexpression, Flag (HA) were tested
48 h post-transfection. Infection of astrocytes with
CDK11p58 full-length cDNA increased the protein
expression level of CDK11p58 by 83% compared with
control at 48 h (Fig. 4a). We examine iNOS protein
expression by western blot and astrocyte cell cycle with or
without LPS stimulus after CDK11p58 overexpression.
CDK11p58 overexpression augmented iNOS expression
(Fig. 4b) in LPS challenged astrocytes. After treating
CDK11p58 overexpression astrocytes with LPS (10 lg/ml)
for 9 h, TNF-a production (Fig. 4c) increased notably.
Flow cytometry shows CDK11p58 overexpression
increased G2 and S phase (65.3%) numbers after LPS
treated (Fig. 4d). Astrocyte proliferation index increased
due to CDK11p58 overexpression after LPS stimulus,
compared with control group (Fig. 4d). These results suggested
that LPS evoked astrocyte inflammatory response
was in a CDK11p58-dependent process.
CDK11p58 Exerted Its Positive Regulation Functions
via Activating p38 and JNK MAPK Pathways
It was reported that JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK are
phosphorylated during various infections. To further
understand whether activation of these two MAPK
signaling pathways occurred in functions of CDK11p58 in
astrocytes induced by LPS, the degrees of JNK1/2 and p38
phosphorylation in the LPS treated astrocytes were examined
by western blot. The kinetics of phosphorylated p38
accumulation in the LPS treated astrocytes was similar to
that of the accumulation of phosphorylated JNK (Fig. 5a).
They were both in a dose-dependent manner. The increased
levels of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were concurrent
with the expression of CDK11p58 in astrocytes
(Fig. 1a). In contrast, the protein levels of total amounts of
JNK and p38 remained unchange in astrocytes at various
dose points compared to that in the untreated cells
(Fig. 5a). To detect the effect of these pathways in LPS
induced astrocyte inflammatory response, CDK11p58-siRNA
was used. Astrocytes were transfected with a nonspecific
siRNA or CDK11p58 siRNA and then exposed to
10 lg/ml LPS for 9 h. After CDK11p58 gene silencing, the
degrees of JNK and p38 phosphorylation decreased
(Fig. 5b).
Discussion
In the present study, we firstly characterized CDK11p58
upregulates rat primary astrocyte inflammatory reaction
induced by LPS. CDK11p58 conferred its effect by promoting
p38 and JNK activation induced by LPS. These
results provided important clues to biology functions of
CDK11p58 in inflammation-induced astrogliosis in rat
brain.
In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed that
neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease
(PD) [20]. Astrocytes respond to spinal cord injury (SCI)
and other CNS insults with a variety of different potential
changes, including alterations in many types of molecular
expression, cellular hypertrophy, migration, proliferation,
and scar formation [21]. Activation of astrocytes leads to
an inflammatory response during disease, infection,
trauma, and ischemia [22], producing diverse inflammatory
mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) [ 23],

interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [ 24, 25], prostaglandins (PGs) and
nitric oxide (NO) [26], reactive oxygen species [27], the
latter being synthesized mainly by the inducible NO synthase
(iNOS), all of which serve immune surveillance
functions by removing foreign microorganisms. In our
research, we use 10 lg/ml LPS to treat primary astrocytes,
finding iNOS production, TNF-a secretion and astrocytic
proliferation index peaked at 9 h after treatment. These
phenomena are very interesting, because in previous other
studies, lipopolysaccharide-induced astrocytic inflammatory
response usually peaked at 12 h. For example, Kozuka
et al. [28] treated rat primary astrocytes with 0.01 lg/ml
LPS for 12 h, finding LPS induced a substantial increase in
iNOS promoter activity in cells. The difference between
our study and others maybe derives from the dose of LPS
application. Higher LPS dose applied induces primary
astrocytes to activate in a shorter period. Our study suggested
LPS induced astrocytes to express CDK11p58 and
produce iNOS and TNF-a in a dose and time-dependent
manner. After knockdown of CDK11p58, iNOS and TNF-a
biosynthesis decreased. iNOS and TNF-a biosynthesis
increased due to CDK11p58 overexpression. These indicated
that CDK11p58 played a regulatory role in the LPS
induced iNOS and TNF-a biosynthesis and inflammatory
response.
Activation of astrocytes and reactive gliosis are cardinal
features in many pathological conditions of the CNS,
including neurotrauma [29]. GFAP is the major intermediate
filament protein in astrocytes. An increase of GFAP
immunoreactivity is considered to be one sensitive marker
of such injuries. However, a mild increase of GFAP
immune-activity is often difficult to differentiate from the
normal staining pattern. The responses of the brain to
trauma and many other pathological insults involve
important astrocyte reactions. Reactive astrocytosis is
usually defined by GFAP immunostaining demonstrating
enlarged cells with increased number of intensely stained
processes. However, mild alterations are often difficult to
assess since astrocytes normally express GFAP. In agreement
with the previous reports [30], the GFAP levels did
not change upon activation (data not shown).
Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (the PITSLRE protein
kinases) are closely related to cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis
and apoptosis in a kinase-dependent manner [31–
34]. To date, at least ten CDK11 isoforms have been cloned
from eukaryotic cells, with their molecular weights varying
from 46 to 110 kDa [33]. Although CDK11p58 shares the
same sequence including the kinase domain as the C-terminus
of CDK11p110, the two isoforms possess different
functions. CDK11p110 is present at a constant level during
the cell cycle and is involved in pre-RNA splicing and the
regulation of RNA transcription [31]. CDK11p58 promotes
centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle formation [35].
Recent studies revealed that CDK11p58 is essential for the
maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion and regulation of
androgen receptor (AR) activity [36]. CDK11p58 is involved
in a variety of important regulatory pathways in eukaryotic
cells, including cell cycle control, apoptosis, neuronal

physiology, differentiation and transcription [37–39]. These
data, along with our results, suggested that CDK11p58 play a
regulatory role in promoting proliferation of astrocytes. In
our study, astrocyte proliferation index obtained by flow
cytometry assay decreased according to knockdown of
CDK11p58, conversely increased after CDK11p58 overexpression.
These results indicate the role of CDK11p58 in
regulating LPS induced astrocyte proliferation.
MAPKs are a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins
that play a critical role in cell signaling by transducing
extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses [40]. They are
involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during
development, neuronal plasticity, and injury responses [41].
The p38 and JNK MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine
kinases that form an integral component of proinflammatory
signaling cascades in various cell types [42], including astroglial
cells [43]. During LPS stimulus, phosphorylated p38
and JNK protein expression changed in a dose-dependent
manner. Block of phosphorylated p38 and JNK cause decrease
of iNOS expression and TNF-a secretion. Our results suggested
LPS-induced astrocyte inflammatory response requires
functional activation of the p38 and JNK pathways.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CDK11p58
expressed by astrocytes promotes astrocyte inflammatory
response via p38 and JNK activation. This unique finding
identifies an important new molecular mechanism by
which astrocytes react during pathological states. Regulation
of the CDK11p58 expression in activated astrocytes
may provide a new strategy to protect against the inflammation-induced
astrogliosis. It will be interesting in the
future to identify and characterize whether CDK11p58
produced by astrocytes can regulate neuronal death during
pathological states in CNS.
