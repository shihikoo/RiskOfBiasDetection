Abstract. Stroke is a devastating disease. The changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism associated
with stroke play an important role in pathophysiology study. But the changes were difficult to describe with a
single imaging modality. Here the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and oxygen
saturation (SO
2
) were yielded with laser speckle imaging (LSI) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) during and
after 3-h acute focal ischemic rats. These hemodynamic measures were further synthesized to deduce the changes
in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). The results indicate that all the hemodynamics except CBV had rapid declines
within 40-min occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO). CBV in arteries and veins first increased to the maximum
value of112.4236.69% and130.5831.01% by 15 min MCAO; then all the hemodynamics had a persistent
reduction with small fluctuations during the ischemic. When ischemia lasted for 3 h, CBF in arteries, veins
decreased to 1714.65%, 24.5220.66%, respectively, CBV dropped to 6218.56% and 5918.48%. And
the absolute SO
2
decreased by40.5222.42%and54.2411.77%. After 180-min MCAO, the changes in hemodynamics
and oxygen metabolism were also quantified. The study suggested that combining LSI and PAM provides
an attractive approach for stroke detection in small animal studies.©2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

1 Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third most
common cause of death worldwide.1–3 For a noncommunicable
disease, it is already and will continue to be the most challenging
disease of increasing socioeconomic importance in aging populations.
Among all types of stroke, ischemic stroke attributable
to large-artery ischemia (most often middle cerebral artery,
MCA) is the most common type and constitutes more than
80% of all strokes.1,3,4 Since there are rich nutrients and oxygen
existing in the blood, the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and
oxygen metabolism responsible for the local neuronal activities
in ischemia often manifest blood flow supply, tissue oxygen
consumption, and tissue viability.5–8 Also, the hemodynamic
changes are key elements of ischemic pathopysiology, which
can be depicted with imaging.9
Current well-established imaging modalities that have been
adopted to study focal cerebral ischemia include computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron
emission tomography (PET).1,3,10–13 They are all able to
image cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow
(CBF) at different time point after stroke. However, CT is unable
to image the oxygen saturation (SO
2
) in vessels even with
contrast agent. MRI is only sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin
(HbR). PET lacks sufficient spatial resolution and requires
the intravenous administration of exogenous radioactive isotopes
, which are inconvenient for continuous study in stroke.
Optical imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution offers
unique advantages and broad prospects for evaluating stroke
physiology in endogenous contrast.14–16It has greatly facilitated
the monitoring of changes in cerebral hemodynamics.5
Up to the present, numerous different embodiments of optical
imaging have been used to investigate the changes in cerebral
hemodynamics after ischemia. Near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) could be adopted to identify the intermittent and spontaneous
peri-infarct depolarizations (PID) during focal cerebral
ischemia in rats.17 Multispectral optical imaging (MSOI) was
demonstrated to map the changes in relative oxyhemoglobin
(HbO) and relative HbR in forepaw stimulation in rat focal cerebral
ischemia.18 Based on diffuse optical tomography (DOT),
CBF, CBV, SO2, and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were
captured after 1 h occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO)
and reperfusion in rats.8 To yield high-resolution spatiotemporal
maps of CBF and oxygen metabolism in focal cerebral
ischemia simultaneously, laser speckle imaging (LSI) and MSOI
had been used in combination.19 Although the previous investigations
clearly visualized the physiological changes following
focal cerebral ischemia, significant challenges remained. Among
these imaging techniques, NIRS and DOT both lack sufficient

spatial resolution to be effective for microvascular imaging.
MSOI is a two-dimensional (2-D) imaging modality to image
the average changes in cerebral hemodynamics of the regional
cortical tissue and vasculature. Moreover, the baseline of optical
properties and hemoglobin concentration should be first
assumed.19–21 In a stroke, nerve cell viability and function are
generally relevant to the hemodynamic signatures and oxygen
consumption.8,22,23 It is difficult to monitor the changes in the
aforementioned parameters with a single imaging modality.
Therefore there is an intense interest in developing a new
approach to accurately assess hemodynamic and metabolic
changes from different vessels of the brain with high spatiotemporal
resolution and eventually obtain a more comprehensive
understanding of stroke.
LSI is a full-field optical technique to image blood flow
changes in vivo. Without scanning, 2-D distribution of CBF
can be obtained with high spatial and temporal resolution.24,25
Up to now, LSI has been demonstrated to be highly effective at
measurement of CBF in the studies of ischemia,26,27 cortical
spreading depression (CSD) and other experimental paradigms.28–30 Photoacoustic imaging, combining the high contrast
of optics and low scattering of ultrasound, is a fast growing imaging
modality, which is capable of multi-scale imaging.5,31–34
Based on photoacoustic imaging, three-dimensional (3-D)
neurovasculature can be mapped in endogenous contrast with
high spatial resolution. Recently, dark-field photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM) as a promising tool was widely used to
assess changes in blood-oxygenation dynamics within the
mouse brain,35,36 hemoglobin SO
2
variations in single vessels,37
brain hemodynamic changes during rat forepaw electrical stimulation
and so on.38–40
To reveal the complicated changes in cerebral hemodynamics
and oxygen metabolism in stroke, CBF, CBV, SO
2
, and OEF in
two groups of rats were first recorded during 3-h acute focal
ischemia with LSI and PAM, respectively. Then CBF, CBV,
SO
2
in single vessels and the index of oxygen metabolism
were imaged before, and after 180-min MCAO in six rats
with these two imaging techniques together. The statistical analysis
was also performed, and then the results were compared
with other investigation.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Setups
The detailed description of the LSI is provided elsewhere.24,41
As shown in Fig. 1(a), laser from laser diode with power of
30 mW, wavelength of 660 nm was used to illuminate the rat
cortex at about 30-deg incidence. The speckle pattern generated
by the scattered laser and modulated by motion of the red blood
cells was acquired through a stereomicroscope (Z16 APO,
Leica, Germany) attached to a charge-coupled device (CCD)
camera (QE 270XS, PCO Pixelfly, Germany) with 20-ms exposure
time and 2×2 binning. The aperture diaphragm and variable
attenuator were well controlled to ensure the average
speckle size to be about two pixels. To achieve high spatial resolution
, the laser speckle temporal contrast analysis (LSTCA)
was adopted to calculate the speckle contrast according to
the following formula:25

indicates the average intensity at pixelðx; yÞover the totalN
images. In our study, every frame of the speckle contrast image
was acquired by analyzing the 100 consecutive raw speckle
images with LSTCA based on GPU. So, it took 2 s to acquire
the first CBF image and the time equivalent of the subsequent
images is 20 ms. The speckle contrast image was then used to
calculate the image of inverse correlation time values (ICT, arbitrary
units) with a simplified approximation (T∕τ
c
≈ 1∕C2,
T ≫ τ
c
), where T was the exposure time of the CCD and τ
c
indicated the correlation time.25 Here the ICT image was
employed as the indicator of the CBF parameter and stored
in a computer for further statistical analysis. Before the ischemic
study, LSI was first used to image a group of sham MCAO rats
with different geometrical position of optical elements and
imaging target. This demonstrated that LSI can be adopted to
compute the baseline of CBF.
PAM used for the rat brain imaging [Fig. 1(b)] was made in
accordance with previous reports.42,43 A tunable dye laser
(Cobra-stretch, Newport, USA) pumped by a Q-switched Nd:
YAG laser (Surelite I-30, Continuum, USA) was adopted to
induce photoacoustic signals. 6.5-ns laser light was firstly delivered
through an optical fiber to the 3-D scanner. The energy of
each laser pulse was detected by a photodiode connected with an
oscilloscope for calibration. Then the beam was expanded and
focused into the tissue with a ring-shaped area of illumination.
The generated ultrasound was collected by a transducer with
the focal region overlapping the optical focus. In the PAM
used here, the ultrasonic detector has a center frequency of
50 MHz and a 70% nominal bandwidth. This enables the system
to exhibit lateral and axial resolutions of 45 and 15 μm at the
focus, respectively. At each location of the ultrasonic transducer,
a depth-resolved photoacoustic wave can be recorded. If a 2-D
raster scanning was implemented, the volumetric images of the

rat brain were acquired. Here, a step size of 30 μm was used. In
our following experiments, the functional imaging was performed
using three wavelengths: 576 nm, an HbO dominant
wavelength, 584 nm, an isosbestic point of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin
and 592 nm, a HbR dominant wavelength. Once
the volumetric images were achieved, the maps of CBV can
be acquired from the maximum amplitude projection (MAP)
at 584 nm. Combining the resulting set of three-wavelength
images, SO
2
in individual vessels could be calculated.37 In
the aforementioned three wavelengths, HbR and HbO are considered
to be the dominant absorbing compounds in the blood.

2.2 Animal Preparation
Specific pathogen-free rats were purchased from Wuhan University
Center for Animal Experiment. Adult male Sprague-Dawley
(SD) rats (280 to 350 g) used in the experiments were fasted
except for water overnight. The rats were anesthetized with a
mixture of 0.2 g∕kg a-chloralose and 1g∕kg urethane administered
intraperitoneally. Each anesthetized rat was placed on the
stereotaxic head holder, and the scalp and muscle were pulled
aside. A craniotomy of approximately 4×6mm 2 size centered
about 4.2-mm posterior and 3.1-mm lateral to Bregma, overlying
the right parietal cortex was performed for each animal with
a high-speed drill under constant saline cooling. The dura was
kept intact. During the surgical operation, the body temperature
of the rat was kept constant at 370.5°C with a heating pad.
Then each rat was allowed to recover for at least 1 h. The physiological
parameters were monitored and maintained within
normal limits during the study. All animal experiments in the
research were conducted by the Committee for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animal at Huazhong University of Science
and Technology.
2.3 Focal Cerebral Ischemia
The intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
was adopted to induce the acute focal ischemia.1 After general
surgical preparation and 1-h rest, the rat was turned to the supine
position. The right common carotid artery (CCA) was carefully
isolated from the soft tissues gently and ligated with a cotton
thread. A poly-L-lysine-coated filament with diameter of
0.28 mm and a rounded tip of about 0.380.02 mm was
inserted through the external carotid artery into the internal carotid
artery to occlude the MCA until the marker was completely
inserted. In order to obtain the acute ischemic stroke, bilateral
CCA was also ligated. Then the midline neck incision was
sewed using surgical suture and some warm water was applied
to the incision to prevent drying. Focal ischemia was confirmed
for each rat with histologic analyses. Twelve hours after the
occlusion, the animals were sacrificed and their brains removed
from the cranium were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) at 37°C for 30 min.8At last, the dorsal sides
of the stained sections were imaged with a camera.
2.4 Hemodynamic Parameters and Oxygen
Metabolism Monitored During 3-H Acute
Focal Ischemia in Rats
Twenty male SD rats were divided into two different experiments
for dynamic functional changes. During 3-h acute
focal ischemia, one group (n ¼ 10) was used for CBF monitored
with LSI and the other (n ¼ 10) was used for CBV, SO
2
, and
OEF monitored with PAM. All the control hemodynamic
parameters were acquired after 60 min surgical operation.
In the first experiment, LSI was adopted for mapping the
2-D distribution of CBF changes during ischemia as shown in
Fig. 2(a). The baseline images were assessed 30 min before the
acute focal ischemia. Immediately after the occlusion, the animal
was placed on the animal holder and transferred to the system
for data acquisition. However, it took about 15 min before
the data collection started. So post-injury imaging was started
approximately 15 min after MCAO. During 3-h ischemia, the
changes in CBF were saved with time interval of 5 min. After
180 min of collecting ischemic distribution of CBF, each rat
was allowed to recover on a heating pad.

(WITH PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
PAM was used to image the changes in CBV, SO
2
, and OEF
in the other investigation. In this experiment, the control study
was also carried out half an hour before ischemia. In order to
confirm a successful occlusion, the distributions of CBF before
occlusion and after 3-h ischemia were also imaged in the same
rat, as shown in Fig.2(a). To obtain the changes in CBVandSO
2
at the same time point with CBF monitored aforementioned,
PAM was used for ischemic images 15 min after ischemia.
Since the pulse repetition rate of the laser, which we used limits
the current imaging speed in C-scan, a specific cross-section was
chosen for dynamic functional images during ischemia with
5-min time interval. The selected cross-section was then repeatedly
imaged at the aforementioned three wavelengths. After
180 min of occlusion, a 2-D scanning was also performed to
indicate the monitored cross-section at 584 nm.
2.5 Changes in CBF, CBV, SO
2
and OEF After 3-H
Acute Focal Ischemic Rats
Six male SD rats were used for the static study of changes in
CBF, CBV, SO
2
, and OEF with both LSI and PAM after 3-h
acute focal ischemia. After each rat recovered for 1 h from
the surgical operation, the baseline CBF, CBV, and SO
2
were
collected respectively as normal control. The schematic of
study design is presented in Fig. 2(b). Thirty minutes after
the control study, the acute focal ischemia in rats was induced.
The changes of the ischemic CBF, CBV, and SO
2
were then
acquired after 180 min of the occlusion.
2.6 Data Analysis
To investigate the relative changes in CBF at different vascular
components, arteries and veins were identified by visual inspection
through a microscopy and manually chosen corresponding
to the regions in the images of CBF. Relative changes in CBF
within the artery and vein were recorded over time as percent
change of preischemic baseline. Thus each rat served as its
own control. This process was done in each research here and
the statistical analysis expressed as meanstandard error of
mean (SEM) was then performed on a group dataset.
The same arteries and veins were investigated in photoacoustic
imaging in the static study of changes in physiological
parameters and oxygen metabolism after 3-h acute focal ischemia
in rats. Compared with the images of CBF, the arteries
and veins obtained by integrating over the full width at halfmaximum
of the vessels were identified in the MAP at
584 nm both before and after ischemia, respectively. The relative
changes in CBV at each time were expressed as percent change
from its baseline. Since it had been demonstrated the capability
of PAM to image quantitatively static SO
2
in single vessels, the
decrease of SO
2
both in artery and vein was expressed as absolute
value from the control. The same process here was
performed in all the experiments. The only difference which
exists here is that in the dynamic functional images with PAM,
the cross-section of artery and vein were mainly determined
from the static SO
2
image before and after ischemia and the distribution
of CBF was only used as a reference. The data from
PAM was then used to calculate OEF:8,44

3 Results
3.1 Hemodynamic Parameters and Oxygen
Metabolism Monitored During 3-H Acute
Focal Ischemia in Rats
A representative experiment for the continuous imaging and
densely sampled longitudinal study in CBF during 3-h ischemia
can be seen in Fig.3. The qualitative maps of changes in CBF at
isolated time points during occlusion are shown in Fig. 3(a).
Immediately after occlusion, there is an abrupt decrease in
CBF in the region close to the anteriority and far from midline,
which is approximately marked by the dotted line box in Fig.3(a)
−0 min. However, a slight increase exists in CBF in the region
indicated by the dotted line circle and far from the anteriority
and close to the midline [Fig. 3(a) −0 min to 40 min].
The MCAO produces the drop in CBF. However, the collateralization
that occurs through the circle of Willis and leptomeningeal
collaterals elevates the CBF in the region 2 [Fig. 3(a)
−0 min].9,45,46 With increasing degrees of ischemia, CBF in
the whole imaging window dropped and the ischemic infarct
area was also increasing, especially in the region close to the
anteriority and far from midline following a well-described progression
in tissue infarction induced by MCAO.47 These observations
are consistent with some previous investigations.7,29,48

The time courses of the relative changes in CBF for arteries
and veins as depicted by “a”and “v ”[Fig.3(a)−0 min -m] can
be found in Fig. 3(b), correspondingly. CBF exhibited a drastic
reduction to 5525.2% of the control values both in arteries
and veins just after 15-min occlusion and then it continued
to decline slowly during the period of arterial occlusion.
After 3-h MCAO, the CBF in arteries and veins dropped to17
14.65% and 24.5220.66% of its baseline, respectively.
Figure 4 displays a representative experiment for a rat
monitored with PAM during 3-h acute focal ischemic stroke in
MAPs. Compared with Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), the photoacoustic
signal intensity decreased slightly in the whole imaging window.
To perform the dynamic functional monitoring, a cross-section
illustrated by the black dashed line in Fig. 4(b) was selected for
repeatedly imaging.
Since 584 nm is an isosbestic absorption wavelength of
hemoglobin, the photoacoustic signal is directly proportional
to the total amount of hemoglobin (HbT) and the reduction
of photoacoustic signal strength indicated that CBV changes
in the vessels in the selected B-scan dropped in Fig. 4(c). At 
592 nm, the molar extinction coefficient of HbR is greater
than that of HbO. Based on the decrease in photoacoustic signals
at 584 nm and increase at 592 nm, it is apparent that SO
2
in the
vessels monitored declined as shown in Fig.4(d). From Fig.4(c)
and 4(d), some structural changes existed in the first minutes in
both images. After acute ischemia, the physiological state of the
animals may fluctuate in a certain range to cause the recording
unstabilized. In contrast with Fig. 4(c), there are several major
fluctuations in photoacoustic signals in Fig. 4(d). These abrupt
changes in photoacoustic signals are presumable to be induced
by the spontaneous and repetitive PID. In the previous investigation
, vasodilation induced by CSD caused the increase of
arterial diameter.49,50 However, the small changes in diameter
can be hardly distinguished by our current acoustic-resolution
PAM. CSD also led the increase of SO
2
, which was produced
by an increase in HbO concentration and a decrease in HbR
concentration.49 These results were consistent with ours.
The time traces of changes in CBV, SO
2
for two vascular
components indicated by red and black arrows [Fig. 4(a), 4(b),
and4(c)] are plotted in Fig.5. There is an overshoot by 12.42
36.69% and 30.5831.01% in CBV for arteries and veins
observed at 15 min following MCAO [Fig. 5(a)]. Thereafter,
the CBV in the two selected vessels had a persistent reduction
with small fluctuations and dropped to 6218.56% and 59
18.48% of the control values after 180-min ischemia. This can
be explained as follows. After ischemia, the vasodilation of
resistance arterioles and veins which is known as autoregulation
can increase the CBV to maintain the normal or slight decrease
in CBF initially. However, when autoregulation is impaired,
CBF and CBV will both decrease with further ischemia.51,52
Also, the hypercapnia is possible to cause the elevation of
CBV just after the ischemia.8
The large changes in CBV during the first 40-min ischemia
[Fig.5(a)] lead to the relatively large reduction ofSO
2
in arteries
and veins existed in Fig.5(b). It can also be referred to Fig.3(b)
where CBF has a relatively large decrease during the same time
period. Then CBF and CBV both decline with a small slope and
SO
2
reaches a relatively stable level with small fluctuations. For

occlusion, the reduction of SO
2
in arteries and veins reached
40.5222.42% and 54.2411.77% from their preischemic
values and remained at this levels. Under these conditions,
OEF increases from 0.180.06 to 0.560.34 [Fig. 5(c)].
3.2 Changes in CBF, CBV, SO
2
, and OEF after 3-H
Acute Focal Ischemic Rats
Figure 6 illustrates the representative status of CBF and CBV
before and after ischemia in the static study of changes in physiological
parameters. From Fig.6(a)and6(b), it is apparent that
as a result of 180-min MCAO, the CBF decreases seriously,
especially in the regions close to the anteriority. This is because
the MCAO used in these investigation produce early ischemic
cell death in striatum to delayed infarction in the overlying frontal
cortex following a well-described progression.47 Compared
with Fig. 6(c) and 6(d), CBV decreases significantly and a
majority of microvessels disappear in the region far from the
midline. This may be explained as follows. After the occlusion
of the main artery, hypoperfusion of downstream microvasculature
was induced. Although collateralization that occurs
through the circle of Willis and leptomeningeal collaterals, there
is still a serious shortage of hemoglobin.9,45 During the increase
of ischemic time, brain microvascular beds are likely to be
most vulnerable and haemorrhagic transformation (HT) will
occur.53,54 With damage of brain microvessels, the blood-brain
barrier will be caused disruption leading to the extravasation of
blood.55 All involved issues contribute to the CBV decreases so
significantly that some vessels disappeared after 3-h ischemia.
The statistical changes in CBF, CBV, SO
2
in arteries and
veins and OEF after 3-h acute focal ischemic stroke are indicated
in Fig. 7. After the occlusion of 180 min, CBF in arteries
and veins decrease to 17.7312.38% and 13.9413.78%
owing to the hypoperfusion of downstream microvasculature
and the corresponding CBV reduce to55.8321.05%,58.98
24.58%, respectively [Fig. 7(a)]. The absolute SO
2
in arteries
and veins decrease by 41.2619.04%, 51.8510.09% compared
with baseline conditions as seen in Fig. 7(b). The reduction
in hemodynamic parameters is consistent with a stagnation
and deoxygenation of blood in the vasculature after ischemia.
For the decrease in CBF, CBV, and SO
2
, OEF increases from
00.220.08 to 0.460.31 in response to the changes. It is
clear that CBF decreases most seriously after the occlusion.
In the situation that CBF, CBV, and SO
2
decrease, oxygen
uptake rate must be improved to maintain the cerebral oxygen
metabolism.52 Compared with the preischemia, the conversion
efficiency of HbO to HbR was increased after ischemia, which
caused the more decrease in SO
2
in vein.
4 Discussion and Conclusion
In this pilot study, LSI and PAM were employed to yield the
changes in CBF and PAM parameters including CBV, SO
2
,
and OEF in response to acute ischemic injury in rat brains.
With these techniques, the physiological parameters and oxygen
metabolism parameters were able to separated and quantified.
Compared with other investigation, a good agreement exists.
Combining the investigation that CBV and OEF both increase
to response the acute ischemia, two compensatory mechanism
were established: autoregulation and increased OEF. The study
suggests that combining LSI and PAM can provide an attractive
approach for quantitative imaging of CBF and oxygen metabolism
in the determination of the mechanism of stroke and
detection.
Comparing with Fig. 4(c) and 4(d), several major fluctuations
existed in photoacoustic signal at 592 nm, where there
were nearly no changes at 584 nm. These discrepancies were
maybe caused by PID in ischemia. At 584 nm, photoacoustic
signals are only sensitive to CBV associated with the vessel
diameter. Some previous researches suggested CSD induced
the small increase of arterial diameter, where veins showed
no obvious change in diameter.49,50 As our current acousticresolution
PAM only had lateral resolution of 45 μm at focus,
the small changes in diameter can be hardly discerned. So there
were no obvious changes in Fig. 4(c), compared with some
major fluctuations in photoacoustic signals in Fig. 4(d). CSD

was also accompanied by an increase in HbO concentration and
a decrease in HbR concentration, which led the increase of
SO
2
.49 In Fig. 4(d), the decrease in photoacoustic signals in
the several major fluctuations indicated the decrease in HbR
concentration, for photoacoustic signal is more sensitive to
the concentration of HbR at 592 nm. Certainly, the spontaneous
and repetitive PID induced by ischemia were also reported by
others.17,56
By comparing the results of hemodynamics measured in static
study and dynamic monitor with 180-min acute ischemic
rats, only a small difference exists. We now discuss the results
with the previous investigations.
4.1 CBF and CBV
Our results show that CBF in arteries, veins decreases to
34.1312.39%, 39.6510.83% after 60 min ischemia and
1714.65%, 24.5220.66% after 3-h MCAO. Correspondingly
, CBV in arteries, veins reduces to 74.6326.05%,
76.9326.73% after 1-h MCAO and 6218.56%, 59
18.48% of the control values after 180-min ischemia. Some
groups have also reported the decrease in CBF and CBV.
Jones et al. introduced that CBF dropped to less than 40% in
the ischemic penumbra and 25% in the ischemic core after 1-h
acute ischemia. Simultaneously, CBV decreased to less than
75% in the ischemic penumbra and 60% in the ischemic
core.7 There have been DOT studies in rats that have shown
CBF reduced to ≈424% in response to 55 min MCAO.8
A study with MRI in gerbils has shown regions with CBF
dropped to 5217%, 3618% of the baseline have decrease
in CBV to 9117%, 7221% related to the control values.57
Using LSI, Shin et al. observed that CBF dropped to less than
40% of the baseline after 60 min ischemia.48 Also, Abookasis
et al. used spatially modulated near-infrared illumination to
demonstrate that there was a reduction about 235.4% in
CBV after 45-min acute ischemia.20 There is a good similarity
between our results and the investigation of other groups.
Based on our results, CBV in arteries and veins increases to
the maximum value of 112.4236.69% and 130.5831.01%
by 15-min MCAO. The increase in CBV in response to ischemia
has been a consistent finding in other experimental studies of
ischemia. Caramia et al. reported a CBV increase about 50%
after 20-min MCAO.51 In the study on patients with subacute
cerebral infarction, an increase in CBV was also demonstrated.58
However, the CBF had a persistent reduction with small fluctuations
during the entire ischemic period. The changes that CBV
varied independently of CBF were also investigated by others.
After ischemia, CBF will drop immediately. To maintain the
CBF and metabolism, cerebral circulation will dilate to increase
the CBV, a reflex known as autoregulatory.52 In the autoregulatory
range, there is no or slight decrease in CBF. When its
upper limit is exceeded, CBF will decrease rapidly.
4.2 SO
2
In the investigation, the absolute SO
2
in arteries and veins
decreases by 41.2619.04%, 51.8510.09% after 3 h ischemia.
It is clear the reduction in SO
2
in vein is greater. This is
because the OEF must increase to maintain tissue function
and oxygen metabolism when the autoregulatory capacity is
exhausted during the ischemia.52 The conversion efficiency of
HbO to HbR was increased after ischemia which caused more
decrease in SO
2
in vein. There are some other reports about the
decrease inSO
2
after ischemia. In the study from Culver et al. an
ischemic region with the averageSO
2
decrease by114%was
visualized.8 With spatially modulated near-infrared illumination
, a 212.2% decrease in cerebral tissue SO
2
was recorded
following 45-min cerebral ischemia.20 Optical-resolution PAM
was already applied to study ischemic stroke in a mouse
model.44 During ischemia, the average SO
2
in artery and vein
dropped by 10% and 34%, respectively. There are significant
differences among these results. This may be due to the use
of different optical imaging modalities. It is important to note
that MSOI is only able to image the average changes in cerebral
hemodynamics of the regional cortical tissue and vasculature,
whereas PAM adopted in this investigation can map the 3-D
neurovasculature with high spatial resolution.
4.3 OEF
For the decrease in CBF, CBV, and SO
2
, OEF increases from
0.180.06 to 0.560.34. In PET studies in a cat MCAO preparation
, there is an increase about 120% to 200% in OEF.59
With DOT, a 1396% increase in OEF was observed after
about 1-h MCAO.8 It should be noted that OEF calculated in
this investigation was based on single pial artery and single
pial vein of cerebral vasculature. This may cause some quantative
errors when compared with other studies. Furthermore, we
did not monitor the some of the systemic physiology parameters,
such as blood gases, blood pressure, and glucose concentration.
The absence of these parameters may affect the baseline of CBF,
SO
2
, and OEF. However, the trend of CBF, SO
2
, and OEF are
still comparable with these previous studies.
Overall, the trends and observation at different time points
in this investigation agree well with similar results using other
imaging techniques. Some discrepancies exist, and they are
conducted in different imaging embodiments, different animal
models, and different ischemic duration. Also, different analysis
regions and different physiological parameters during the
imaging may affect the results.
4.4 Others
It should be noted that LSTCA rather than laser speckle spatial
contrast analysis (LSSCA) was employed to image the CBF
changes during ischemia with LSI. The traditional LSSCA,
based on calculation in the spatial domain with a spatial window,
has low spatial resolution and statistical accuracy, impeding the
applications in individual small vessels. However, LSTCA can
compute the speckle contrast images with the original high
spatial resolution, which makes it appropriate in applications on
mapping CBF changes in single vessels. With different laser
speckle contrast analysis methods, there may be a discrepancy
existed in the study.
In PAM, to obtain the cerebral blood vessels with high spatial
resolution, the skull was removed and the commercial ultrasound
coupling gel was applied to the tissue surface to reduce
the attenuation of the ultrasound signal. However, the coupling
gel may affect the physiological environment of the brain.
Therefore, carefully selection of coupling gel must be made.
And the effect of coupling gel is desired to be investigated.
This issue can also be solved by introduction of noncontact
detection of ultrasound, which does not need any coupling
agent. Since the current imaging speed is 30 A-line/s and mainly
limited by the pulse repetition rate of laser pulse, only vascular
segments in a specific chosen cross-section were monitored for

dynamic functional imaging during periods of arterial occlusion.
With the imaging speed accelerated, a satisfactory C-scan should
be performed at each time point. Limitation also existed regarding
the employed MCAO models. It takes about 15 min to make
the model and adjust the imaging system to start data collection.
In fact, the changes in hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism
during the first few minutes are the key elements for ischemia
early diagnosis and treatment. These will be solved in our
next work.
