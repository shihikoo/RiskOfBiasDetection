biomarkers or PCR for human DNA found little penetration 
of HUCBC in the newborn brain in the immediate newborn 
period, suggesting that the beneficial effects were not due 
to cellular integration or direct proliferative effects but rather
to paracrine signaling. This is the first study to show that 
HUCBC improve motor performance in a dose-dependent

 Introduction 
 Cerebral palsy (CP) has a very high index of disease 
burden, resulting in life-long neurological consequences 
to the patient, caretakers and social institutions. One of 
the major pathogenetic causes of CP is hypoxia-ischemia 
(HI) in the antenatal period  [1, 2] . HI at the maternal, 
placental or fetal level often results in neonatal encephalopathy
or newborn HI encephalopathy (HIE). At the 
present time, the only treatment available for HIE is hypothermia
initiated within 6 h of birth. Hypothermia offers
only 11% reduction in risk of death or disability – 
from 58 to 47%  [3] . Further, there are considerable un-

 Abstract 
 Cerebral palsy (CP) has a significant impact on both patients 
and society, but therapy is limited. Human umbilical cord 
blood cells (HUCBC), containing various stem and progenitor
cells, have been used to treat various brain genetic conditions.
In small animal experiments, HUCBC have improved 
outcomes after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. Clinical trials using
HUCBC are underway, testing feasibility, safety and efficacy
for neonatal injury as well as CP. We tested HUCBC therapy
in a validated rabbit model of CP after acute changes 
secondary to HI injury had subsided. Following uterine ischemia
at 70% gestation, we infused HUCBC into newborn rabbit
kits with either mild or severe neurobehavioral changes. 
Infusion of high-dose HUCBC (5 × 10 6  cells) dramatically altered
the natural history of the injury, alleviating the abnormal
phenotype including posture, righting reflex, locomotion
, tone, and dystonia. Half the high dose showed lesser 
but still significant improvement. The swimming test, however
, showed that joint function did not restore to naïve con-

resolved safety concerns around cooling preterm 
newborns  [4] . Part of the reason for the modest effect in 
term babies is that the precise timing of the initial insult 
is often unclear. Promising add-on treatments such as 
erythropoietin and xenon are now in phase 2 clinical trials.
After the child manifests CP there are no available 
curative therapies.
  There have been excellent reviews exploring the potential
use of progenitor or stem cells as a therapy for HI 
[5, 6] . It is postulated that they might replace lost neurons, 
protect endogenous host cells and promote their growth 
and differentiation, as well as modulate the host immune 
response, all of which may decrease disability after HI. 
Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) have been 
shown to be beneficial in numerous preclinical studies 
using models of newborn rodent HI  [7–10]  – except one, 
which used a lower dose than the others and which 
showed no benefit  [11] .
  So far, >35,000 allogeneic transplants using cryopreserved
and publicly banked HUCBC have been performed
worldwide over the past 20 years. At Duke University
alone, >1,500 have been performed, of which 
>300 were performed in infants and children, using autologous
cells  [12] . Currently, in allogeneic transplantation
, the minimal effective dose after myeloablative therapy
to reestablish hematopoiesis is 25 million nucleated 
cells/kg of recipient body weight. Doses of up to 800 million
cells/kg have been given safely to infants in the first 
month of life. Minimally effective doses of cord blood 
cells in the autologous setting have not been established 
and are likely to vary depending on the clinical indication.
We have recently reported the safety and feasibility 
of collection, preparation and infusion of fresh autologous
HUCBC for use in infants with HIE. Cell doses of 
1–5 × 10 7  cells/kg/dose were given intravenously for up 
to 4 doses  [13] .
  We tested the use of HUCBC in the model of CP we 
have developed. We infused intravenous HUCBC postnatally
into our newborn rabbit kits following antenatal 
HI at 70% gestation  [14]  and showed significant improvement
in motor function. The initial dose we used for rabbits
was comparable to the standard dose of HUCBC 
transfusions for humans on a per kilogram basis, 5 × 10 6
cells/single dose.
  Materials  and  Methods 
 The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of North-
Shore University HealthSystem Research Institute approved all experimental
procedures with animals.
  Collection  of  HUCBC 
 Fresh HUCBC donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank 
(CCBB) by mothers delivering normal, term infants but not qualifying
for banking for transplantation was obtained from the 
CCBB after processing. Cord blood was collected aseptically into 
cord blood collection bags (Pall Medsep, Covina, Calif., USA) containing
35 ml of citrate phosphate dextrose anticoagulant and obtained
from deliveries of mothers  [15] . HUCBC were transported 
at room temperature in validated shippers to the CCBB processing 
laboratory at Duke University. The collected cells were reduced in 
volume and RBC count after 20–30 min incubation with 6% hetastarch
using the Sepax 1 automated processing system (Biosafe, 
Geneva, Switzerland). Pre- and postprocessing total nucleated cell 
counts, postprocessing CD34+ cell content, colony-forming units, 
sterility, and viability were assessed. HUCBC were concentrated 
into appropriate volumes for injection and then shipped overnight 
at 4  °  C to NorthShore University HealthSystem where they were 
injected the next day to kits. After arrival at NorthShore, an aliquot 
was taken for flow cytometry for a cell count before infusion into 
newborn kits.
  Antenatal  HI 
 The surgical procedure has been previously described in detail 
[14, 16] . In vivo global HI of fetuses was induced by sustained 40-
min uterine ischemia at 22 days of gestation (70% term, embryonic
day 22, E22) in timed pregnant New Zealand white rabbits 
(Myrtle’s Rabbits, Thompson Station, Tenn., USA). Briefly, the 
dams were anesthetized with intravenous fentanyl (75 µg/kg/h) 
and droperidol (3.75 mg/kg/h) followed by spinal anesthesia using 
0.75% bupivacaine. A balloon catheter was introduced into the left 
femoral artery and advanced into the descending aorta to above 
the uterine arteries. Body core temperature was monitored with a 
rectal temperature probe. The balloon was inflated for 40 min, 
causing uterine ischemia and subsequent global fetal HI. At the 
end of the HI period, the balloon was deflated, resulting in uterine 
reperfusion and a reperfusion-reoxygenation period for the fetal 
brains. The catheter was removed, the femoral artery was repaired 
and the dam was allowed to recover. The dams next underwent C-
section at E31 just before term delivery (term 31.5 days). C-section 
was done to ensure that the HUCBC were given at the proper time 
for all newborn kits.
  Abbreviated  Neurobehavioral  Examination 
 After birth each newborn kit was subjected to an abbreviated 
neurobehavioral examination investigating locomotor function 
and muscle tone based on the previous published protocols  [16] . 
The newborn kits were classified as ‘severe’ if they had hypertonia, 
postural changes or obvious locomotor deficits or ‘mild’ if they had 
just mild deficit(s). The kits that were not affected were not included
in the study. The division into mild and severe was performed
for purposes of avoiding bias and avoiding chance imbalance
in populations in treated group with HUCBC.
  Infusion  of  HUCBC 
 After assignment to mild and severe groups, infusion of 
HUCBC, saline or media was randomly performed. This was performed
in two phases. In the first phase, each of the severe and mild 
groups was independently randomized to receive a 1.0 ml-volume 
containing one of the following: (1) 5 × 10 6  HUCBC cells, (2) media
that was used to transport HUCBC or (3) saline. The solutions

were given by intravenous injection via the external jugular or anterior
abdominal vein using a 26-gauge butterfly needle or Abbocath-T
intravenous catheter (26 gauge × 3/4 inch; Abbott Laboratories
, Chicago, Ill., USA). The solutions were infused at  ∼ 4 h after 
birth on E31 (postnatal day 0, P0). The duration of infusion was 
1–2 min. For convenience sake, the HUCBC treatment was labeled 
as high dose.
  In the second phase, following analysis of results of phase one, 
each of the severe and mild groups was again independently randomized
to receive either of the following: (1) 2.5 × 10 6   HUCBC 
cells or (2) saline (1-ml volume). The solutions were infused at 
∼ 4 h after birth on E31 (P0). The duration of infusion was 5 min 
and delivery was by a PHD 2000 programmable pump (Harvard 
Apparatus, Holliston, Mass., USA). This HUCBC treatment was 
labeled as low dose.
  Detailed  Neurobehavioral  Examination 
 At E32 (P1), P5 and P11, we performed a neurobehavioral battery
of tests on the newborn kits, which assessed both motor and 
sensory function, as both are often affected in CP. Primary end 
points were as follows: (1) tone: modified Ashworth scale was used 
for scoring; (2) posture: evaluations of standing posture and trunk; 
(3) locomotion: ability to walk and jump; (4) righting: trunk and 
limb movement, and (5) dystonia score: assessing involuntary 
movements by adapting a clinical classification  [17] . All tests were 
videotaped and scored by two investigators masked to group identity.
P11 was chosen as a significant developmental milestone since 
it corresponds with eye opening and a substantial increase in mobility
and motor abilities to near-adult levels.
  Joint function and limb movement were assessed by a forced 
swimming test  [18] , which allows the detection of lack of coordination
between upper and lower joints and mild motor deficits and 
assesses recovery with two-joint analysis. The maximum and minimum
angles were calculated to define maximal extension and 
flexion known to be affected in CP and rabbits  [18] . The mean and 
median angles, a measure of the mid joint motion, reflected differences
between extensor and flexor tone that could change the midpoint
of joint motion.
  MRI Estimation of Brain Entry 
 As proof of principle, we assessed whether HUCBC enters the 
newborn kit brain and whether we could detect it noninvasively by 
MRI. Dams at E22 were subjected to 40 min of uterine ischemia. 
We added another E29 HI protocol to maximize the chances of 
HUCBC entering a freshly injured brain, with the differences from 
the E22 protocol being that at E29 the dams were subjected to 
32 min of uterine ischemia, and C-section was performed at E30. 
The duration of ischemia at E29 was decreased to make the potency
of the insult equivalent to that at E22 (as advanced gestation 
fetuses were more susceptible to length of insult)  [19] .
  Cell Labeling for MRI Tracking 
 HUCBC cells were labeled with two compounds: Gadofluorine 
M (Shering, Germany), which provided positive image contrast 
(signal enhancement on T1-weighted images) and Feridex (11.2 
mg Fe/ml; Berlex Imaging, Wayne, N.J., USA), which provided 
negative image contrast (signal drop on T2-weighted images)  [20] . 
In detail, 100 µl of 250 m M  Gadofluorine stock was dissolved in a 
1-ml final volume of media and incubated at 37  °  C/5%  CO 2   for 
45 min. Cells were washed and incubated in six-well plates – 5 × 
10 7  cells in 5 ml culture medium with 25 m M  Gadofluorine or 
25 m M  Feridex for 24 h at 37  °  C. Cells were washed 3 times by 
sedimentation (5 min, 210  g ,  25  °  C). Unlabeled cells were prepared 
by incubation without labels with the same cell concentrations as 
above. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of media in 1.5-ml tubes. 
Incubation time and label concentration for labeling were optimized
in a separate set of experiments.
  In  vivo  MRI 
 The dams underwent C-section at E30 and the newborn kits 
were infused intravenously with 5 × 10 6  HUCBC labeled with 
Gadofluorine, Feridex or unlabeled cells. The rabbit kits were imaged
at 24 h (n = 3 per group) or 72 h (n = 2 per group) after 
HUCBC infusion.
  The rabbit kits were sedated with an intramuscular injection of 
a mixture of ketamine (35 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and 
acepromazine (1.0 mg/kg). The animals were placed supine in a 
cradle heated with a water blanket at 35  °  C and imaged in a 4.7-tesla
Bruker Biospec system (Bruker, Billerica, Mass., USA) with a 
30-mm single-loop receiver-only coil. A 70-mm volume coil was 
used for excitation. High-resolution T2-weighted (TR/TE/NEX 
5200/31/5) and T1-weighted images (TR/TE/NEX 500/9/12) were 
obtained in axial and coronal planes using RARE sequence (matrix 
256 × 256, in-plane resolution 0.08 × 0.11 mm, 1 mm slice thickness
). FLASH T2 * -weighted images (TR/TE/NEX 1000/10/5) were 
also obtained with the same geometry as above.
  Evaluating Minimum Visibility Threshold 
 Gel phantoms were prepared by suspending labeled cells in 2% 
agarose in serial dilutions up to 1:  256 from an initial concentration 
of 1.2–2 × 10 6  cells/ml. Phantoms were imaged in a 4.7-tesla Bruker
Biospec system with a 30-mm single-loop receiver-only coil 
with the same imaging sequences and resolution as above for in 
vivo imaging. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise (against gel 
phantom without cells) values were obtained for each cell concentration
in T1-weighted images for Gadofluorine-labeled cells and 
T2-weighted images for Feridex-labeled cells. 
  High-Field  MRI 
 The E32 rabbit kits (with HUCBC injection 24 h after 32 min 
of HI at E29) that were used in the in vivo imaging experiments 
were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
solution. Samples were postfixed in the fixative solution for 
1 week and rehydrated in PBS 24 h before imaging. A gel phantom 
was prepared by suspension of Feridex-labeled HUCBC in 2% agarose
with a final concentration 3.65 × 10 3  cells/ml and 0.5 ml in a 
centrifuge tube. Fixed brain specimens and gel phantoms were imaged
in a 14.1 vertical Bruker magnet using a 20-mm volume probe 
and 3D FLASH sequence (TR/TE/FA/NEX 50/23/12/6), providing 
T1/T2 contrast with isotropic resolution of 50 µm and imaging 
time of 10 h 38 min.
  Estimating for Human DNA Entry into Newborn Brain 
 To assess whether there was any long-term biodistribution or 
engraftment of HUCBC into the newborn brain, we next devised a 
high-sensitivity method to detect human DNA entry into the newborn
brain. Rabbit brains were obtained after transcardial perfusion 
with saline, and total DNA was extracted. We used a PCR method 
using 30 cycles of PCR amplification based on a published method 
[21] . DNA was isolated from several rabbit kit brains at P18 using

an Allprep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen TM ). The DNA was PCR amplified
using primers derived from a portion of the human mitochondrial
cytochrome b region, which shows no homology to other animal
species  [21] . These primers showed no cross-reactivity to rabbit
brain samples and we were able to identify as little as 40 human 
cells in 50 mg of rabbit brain tissue. This sensitivity was established 
by adding series-diluted HUCBC into 50 mg of rabbit brain tissue.
  Statistical  Analysis 
 The effect of HUCBC treatment was analyzed by repeatedmeasures
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; GLM procedure 
in SAS statistical software). Data were presented as means ± standard
error of means. The level of statistical significance, α, was set 
as 0.05.
  Results 
 HUCBC Improves Motor Outcome across Severity 
Injury Groups 
 A detailed neurobehavioral examination at P1 (E32) 
revealed that there was initially no significant difference 
in motor deficit scores between the treatment and control 
groups in either the severe or mild groups ( table 1 ), indicating
that the groups were most likely equivalent at study 
entry at P0 (E31). Conversely, one could infer that there 
was no significant improvement at 1 day after treatment.
  The differences in motor outcome measures between 
the saline and media groups were tested in repeated-measures
ANOVA. No difference was found between the 
groups with respect to the interaction term ‘time × treatment
’ in any outcome measure (given α = 0.05). The saline 
and media groups were combined for the further analysis. 
The effect of HUCBC (‘treatment’) on motor outcome 
measures was tested using repeated-measures ANOVA 
with ‘time’, taking into consideration the outcomes at P1, 
P5 and P11 as repeated measures (n = 15), and compared 
to a new control group containing both saline and media 
groups (n = 18). The initial severity of motor deficits, mild 
or severe, was added to the model as a covariate ‘severity’ 
(n = 17 severe, n = 16 mild). Using multivariate statistics 
Wilks’ Lambda, the interaction term time × treatment was 
found to be significantly related to locomotion, tone, posture
, and righting outcome measures (p < 0.0001 for all 
outcomes), thus affirming statistically significant effects 
of the HUCBC on changes in motor outcome between P1, 
P5 and P11 time points. The interaction term time × severity
was also significantly associated with the outcome 
measure of tone (p = 0.0091), indicating that the effect of 
the treatment was different between the mild and severe 
groups. Therefore, the changes in motor scores from P1 to 
P5 and P11 for the mild and severe groups are presented 
separately in  figures 1  and  2 . Absolute values of motor 
outcome variables between ages, the severity of initial injury
and treatment groups are presented in online supplementary
table 1 (for all online suppl. material, see www.
karger.com/doi/10.1159/000374107).
  High-Dose HUCBC Infusion Improves Outcome in 
Survivors 
 Following high-dose HUCBC infusion (see Methods), 
survivors in the severe group showed a significant improvement
in motor function from P1 to P11 in all categories
of neurobehavioral testing ( fig. 1 ). There was an 
increase in scores of posture, locomotion and righting, 
with a concomitant decrease in hypertonia and dystonia 
scores. Survivors in the mild group also showed an improvement
of motor deficits ( fig. 2 ). The absolute change 
in scores was smaller in this group, but the initial impairment
was also mild.
  Examination of the survival curves revealed that there 
was a trend towards increased mortality, although not

statistically significant , following high-dose HUCBC infusion
relative to saline and media control groups (p = 
0.070, χ 2  test). The initially higher mortality rate in the 
HUCBC group was comparable to control groups after a 
reduction of the infusion rate. There was no difference in 
weight gain in survivors.
  Low-Dose HUCBC Infusion Causes No Mortality but 
the Effect Is Less 
 We then hypothesized that a lower dose of HUCBC 
cell infusion would result in no increase in mortality, 
while retaining the capacity to improve neurobehavioral 
outcome. In the severe group, low-dose HUCBC or saline 
infusion resulted in no mortality. Again, there was significant
(but milder than noted in the high-dose group) 
improvement in tone, posture, righting reflex, locomotion
, and dystonia score from P1 to P11 (n = 5, repeatedmeasures
ANOVA, p  < 0.05 in all 5 measures;  fig.  3 ). 
There was also no difference in weight gain in the survivors.

lack of coordination between the upper and lower joints

HUCBC with two-joint analysis, thus providing some insight
into sites of injury. We also wanted to know whether
the neurobehavioral improvement was due to a restoration
to the control state or to some other compensatory 
state.
  Functional deficits of joint movements can be discovered
using graphs obtained from two-joint analysis. As 
shown in  figure 4 , the low-dose HUCBC did not restore 
joint function to the control state, but joint movements in 
this group had a different pattern from those of the salinetreated
kits, suggesting the involvement of compensatory 
mechanisms in the adaptation of muscle tone, range of 
motion and joint movement pattern in the HUCBC treated
group. The range of motion and median angle did not 
change with HUCBC treatment (online suppl. fig. 1).

  Absence of MRI Evidence of Intraparenchymal Entry 
of HUCBC into Newborn Brain 
 Cells labeled with Feridex provided larger signal difference
( fig. 5 a) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR;  fig. 5 b) 
on T2-weighted images than Gadofluorine on T1-
weighted imaging. The CNR for the Feridex label was 
2.05 with a signal-to-noise ratio being 129 to detect 
15,600 cells/ml in the region of interest (ROI). With a 
resolution of 0.08 × 0.1 × 1 mm in voxels used for in vivo 
imaging, this would theoretically provide detection of 
1.23 Feridex-labeled cells in an ROI 3 × 3 pixel size. This 
calculation was done with CNR relative to agarose gel 
phantom, which has similar T2 properties to newborn 
rabbit gray matter. Detection level in a real brain requires 
a much larger CNR due to the high signal inhomogeneity 
of brain tissue.
  No clear evidence of the HUCBC penetrating brain 
parenchyma was found on T2-weighted images in kits infused
with labeled HUCBC with slower infusion rates at 
24 h ( fig. 5 d) and 72 h after HI and imaged 24 h later 
( fig. 5 e), nor were hyperintensities suggestive of the presence
of labeled cells found on T1-weighted images ( fig. 5 f). 
Blood vessels penetrating white and gray matter were 
conspicuous on T2-weighted images ( fig. 5 c–e, arrows) as 
black punctate hypointensities. Notably, the vessels were 
darker in images of kits infused with labeled cells than 
those infused with unlabeled cells ( fig. 5 c–e, arrows). The 
difference in the CNR between these two images relative

to gray matter was 0.38. Assuming the same CNR for labeled
cells as obtained in phantom ( fig.  5 b) and blood 
volume of 6 ml in E32 rabbit kits, these numbers imply 
the presence of 4.11 × 10 3  HUBC in the circulatory system 
24 h after the infusion of 2.5 × 10 6   cells.
  To confirm that there was no extravasation of the labeled
cells, the brains from the kits that had been imaged 
in vivo were transcardially perfused to remove blood and 
subsequently fixed and imaged overnight with high resolution
using a 14.1-tesla magnet with 50 µm of isotropic 
resolution. Feridex-labeled single cell detection was possible
at this resolution, as confirmed by imaging a gel 
phantom prepared from Feridex-labeled cell suspension 
with the same imaging parameters ( fig. 6 a, b). When imaged
together, punctate signal voids were clearly visible in 
the phantom with labeled cells ( fig.  6 b) but not in the 
phantom without cells ( fig. 6 a). No image signatures of 
the labeled cells were detected in the parenchyma of the 
brain sample with Feridex-labeled HUCBC infusion 
( fig.  6 d) compared to that with unlabeled cell infusion 
( fig. 6 c). The choroid plexus was darker in the brain sample
where labeled cells were infused than in the brain with

nonlabeled cell infusion ( fig. 6 c, d, arrows). This may indicate
that some HUCBC may be lodged in this highly 
vascularized region, but no cell propagation to parenchyma
was noticed.
  Possible Entry of HUCBC into Newborn Brain 
 There are several possibilities that may explain the 
MRI results such as the following: (1) HUCBC did not 
enter the brain in appreciable numbers to be detected on 
MRI using our techniques, (2) loss of the MRI label with 
cell division or (3) the labeling procedure changed the 
properties of HUCBC and they lost the ability to enter 
brain parenchyma and reach sites of injury. We next tested
for subacute evidence of human cells in the rabbit newborn
brain parenchyma by detecting human DNA in P5 
kits. PCR reactions targeting specific human gene sequences
were performed. In the 10 brain samples we tested
, 8 cortex and 9 thalamus samples showed positive results
for human DNA, with none for the saline group 
( fig. 6 e).

  Discussion 
 This is the first study to test whether HUCBC infusion 
after the discovery of neurobehavioral deficits following 
antenatal HI would ameliorate the clinical deficits cause 
by HI injury. The results suggest that there may be improvements
in locomotion following HUCBC (see video) 
over a moderate period of time, considering that rabbit 
days are shorter than human days in the rate of development.
High-dose HUCBC may provide a larger degree of 
amelioration of neurobehavioral deficits, although this 
was not definitely proven as the experiments were designed
to compare different doses. There was a definite 
improvement over the saline-treated group in both phases
of the study, first with the high dose and later with the 
low dose.
  In contrast to usual drug development, there has been a 
paucity of animal studies in this field. The translational implications
of the present study reside in a narrow time period
following an antenatal HI event. The antenatal insult 
in this study was 9 days before delivery and the infusion of 
HUCBC. An approximate corollary in humans would be if 
HI occurred at 24–28 weeks of gestation based on oligodendrocyte
development in rabbits  [22]  and HUCBC were 
given at term birth. If one looks at the evolution of injury 
after HI, broadly there are three time epochs. The first is 
the ‘acute’ epoch, where cell injury occurs with the onset of 
primary and secondary energy failure  [23] . Cytotoxic edema
, cell death and apoptosis result from severe HI in the 
first few days. Hypothermia as a rescue therapy is given at 
this time to prevent further deterioration  [24] .
  The second time epoch can be called the ‘chronic’ epoch
, which spans the next few days to months and involves
a period of cell repair and recovery. It may also 
involve secondary inflammatory processes – some of 
them damaging. This is the time epoch that the HUCBC 
were given in the present study. Mention must be made 
of two adjunct therapies with hypothermia that are now 
in clinical trials – erythropoietin and xenon. The elucidation
of the mechanism of action of HUCBC runs into the 
same problems that have faced the mechanism of action 
of erythropoietin – a circulating hormone. Erythropoietin
does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is also a 
blood-borne growth factor. Erythropoietin as a drug 
therapy is now being tested in clinical trials despite not 
knowing its exact mechanism of action. For both term 
and preterm infants, erythropoietin involves the modification
of ‘acute’ injury initially in most animal studies 
[25]  and extends into the ‘chronic’ epoch in some animal 
and human studies  [26]  and the proposed ongoing clinical
trials. Erythropoietin is being tested in newborn babies
and needs to be given in repeated doses  [27, 28] .  Xenon
is another adjunct therapy with hypothermia now 
being tested for term HIE in clinical trials  [29] . The cost 
of xenon is somewhat prohibitive at the present time.

  The third time epoch is the ‘late’ epoch, which starts 
with the definitive diagnosis of CP at about 12–24 months 
of age. Damaging processes have become quiescent, and 
development adaptations result in the final clinical phenotype.
Autologous HUCBC is presently in clinical trials 
for this time period for CP patients  [30, 31] . The two actively
enrolling studies are at Duke University and Georgia
Regents University (see clinicaltrials.gov).
  All the previous animal studies using HUCBC have 
been performed in the ‘acute’ epoch and employ the 
Vannucci model of unilateral carotid artery ligation followed
by a period of moderate hypoxia on P7 in rats or 
mice. Meier et al.  [8]  reported reduced ‘spastic paresis’ 
when 10 7  HUCBC were given intraperitoneally 24 h after
HI in P7 rats. Cells migrated to the injured side, but 
the cells had not differentiated 21 days after infusion. 
This group also showed no effect on the size of the lesion 
but demonstrated significantly preserved somatosensory
function on the side of the lesion  [32] . Notably, they 
found reduced hyperexcitabilty and restoration of the 
cortical maps and receptive fields in the somatosensory 
cortex. This strongly suggests that the benefit was mediated
by improved function of the surviving brain tissue. 
This group also showed faster resolution of inflammation
and astrocytic activation with HUCBC  [33] .  Similarly
, Yasuhara et al.  [9]  found that intravenous infusion 
of 15,000 HUCBC, with or without cotreatment with 
mannitol, 7 days after HI in P7 rats was associated with 
significant improvement in motor asymmetry and coordination
7 and 14 days later. Only a few cells were found 
in the damaged area, and the authors suggest a paracrine 
effect as the levels of neural growth factor, glial cell linederived
neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor were increased 3 days after treatment – 
but only when cells were combined with mannitol to 
increase blood-brain barrier permeability and not with 
cells alone. In contrast, the same group reported that intrahippocampal
injection of 200,000 marrow-derived 
multipotent progenitor cells (Athersys, Inc., Cleveland, 
Ohio, USA) did not improve rotarod testing and only 
improved motor asymmetry 14 days later  [34] .  Consistent
with these findings, Pimentel-Coelho et al.  [7]
found that intraperitoneal injection of HUCBC in P7 
rats 3 h after HI was associated with only trivial numbers 
of HUCBC in the lesion in contrast with slight improvements
in sensorimotor reflexes 4 days after HI but not 
different at 2 and 7 days. The improved outcomes were 
associated with reduced caspase-3 cleavage around the 
lesion site and an overall reduction in activated microglia
and macrophages consistent with antiapoptotic and 
anti-inflammatory actions. In contrast, de Paula et al. 
[11]  initially reported 8 deaths and no improvement in 
infarct volume or in spatial memory 3 weeks after 1 × 
10 7  mononuclear cells were given intravenously 24 h after
HI in P7 rats. Subsequently, the same group reported 
dose-response findings on infarction by showing reduced
infarction volume with 10 7  and 10 8  HUCBC but 
not 10 6  HUCBC. Improvement in the Morris water 
maze for spatial memory was only found with a dose of 
10 8  HUCBC  [35] .
  The various stem cells present in HUCBC include hematopoietic
stem cells (CD34), unrestricted somatic stem 
cells, umbilical cord stem cells), and very small embryonic-like
stem cells, all of which contribute to the high proliferative
and self-renewing capacity. HUCBC have been 
shown to differentiate in vitro under the right conditions 
to neurons  [36] , oligodendrocytes  [37, 38]  and astrocytes 
[39] . They also contain precursors of mesenchymal stromal
cells  [40] . Autologous HUCBC have the major advantage
of not requiring immunosuppression  [12, 41] , 
but this is balanced by the hematogenous origin of the 
cells and, thus, less clear commitment to neural differentiation.
  Given the example of hypothermia  [25]  and erythropoietin
 [42] , where the therapy was tested in large animal 
models before implementation in humans, the Study 
Group for Therapies for CP recommended in a recent review
that fresh autologous HUCBC is of sufficiently low 
risk to justify early safety and feasibility studies, but more 
testing should be done in animals larger and more complex
than rodents  [5] . Compared to rodents, rabbits are 
perinatal brain developers, similar to humans, especially 
concerning motor development. Most human perinatal 
HI is global in origin, similar to the present model. The 
timing of the antenatal insult resembles that of an insult 
to the extreme premature human newborn, considering 
the maturation of oligodendrocytes  [22] .
  Our results showed that intravenous infusion of 
HUCBC may not necessarily lead to HUCBC entry into 
the brain tissue in appreciable numbers, since MRI demonstrated
only cells in the vascular system and DNA studies
showed only a very small number in the brain. With 
the limitation of employed MRI methods we cannot exclude
the possibility of small HUCBC engraftment not 
detectable by MRI, as reported in some studies  [43] ,  but 
the amount of such engrafted cells is likely to be small. 
The dilution of iron labeling due to cell division is probably
not a reason for the absence of signal, as this has been 
shown to be a factor only several days after infusion  [44] . 
The small numbers reaching the brain are probably due

to the trapping of most HUCBC in the lungs on a first pass 
through the lungs  [45]  and additionally in the kidneys 
and spleen  [46] .
  The rate of intravascular infusion of HUCBC may be 
a factor as too rapid an infusion may be deleterious, as 
reflected in the trend towards increased mortality in the 
beginning of the study. Mortality probably occurred 
from the complication of pulmonary emboli that are 
known to form after intravenous injection of human 
mesenchymal stem cells in mice  [47] . It is also possible 
that rapid infusion caused pulmonary edema due to sudden
fluid overload. When we slowed down the injection 
speed to 1 ml/5 min in the second phase, there was no 
more mortality.
  Among the various possible neuroprotective mechanisms
, paracrine effects  [48]  such as anti-inflammatory 
and growth factor effects  [49]  have been suggested as possible
candidates, although the evidence is scanty. There is 
a suggestion that following intraperitoneal injection in 
the Vannucci model in rodents, HUCBC home in on the 
damaged cortex, and this targeting depends upon a chemokine
stromal-derived factor  [49] . Following intravenous
injection in a similar model with concurrent cyclosporine
treatment, progenitor neurons and microglia 
were increased in the brain, but there was not much 
change in brain chemokines  [48] . Chemokines were 
shown to be increased in vitro in HUCBC  [48] , but the 
direct link between these chemokines originating from 
HUCBC and beneficial effects has not been shown and is 
worthy of further study.
  Entry into the brain may not be totally necessary for a 
neuroprotective effect. The endothelial cells in the neurovascular
cells can play a major role in protecting neurons 
[50] . The speculation is that the HUCBC possibly modify 
the neurovascular cells to secrete more stimulatory and 
neurotrophic factors. Although human DNA PCR results 
did not exactly correlate with neurobehavioral improvement
, the presence of human DNA would suggest the 
possibility that even a few HUCBC may also directly stimulate
endogenous proliferation of stem cells or progenitor 
cells.
  A significant improvement in motor scores with 
HUCBC treatment was observed as the primary outcome
of the study. The findings of the swimming test 
have to be taken into context as it was designed to discover
mild locomotor deficits in the absence of hypertonia
(as a test mitigating the effect of gravity). We also 
used the swimming test to give us a clue about the regional
nature of the injury in the brain – whether it was 
affecting the forelimb or hindlimb joints. Thus, for example
, the swimming test can tell us whether an intervention
caused the animal to adopt a motor strategy similar
to control animals or something different. An intervention
such as HUCBC that does not achieve control 
curves is not necessarily deemed unsuccessful. It is 
known that human patients with CP adapt their internal 
locomotor models  [51]  in order to be able to ambulate 
even with quite severe restrictions in range of motion 
and hypertonia. The key issue is whether an intervention 
can restore the ability to walk, which was the case with 
HUCBC for CP rabbits. A decrease in hypertonia and an 
increase in range of motion, which were observed in our 
study, would certainly improve motor abilities in CP 
rabbits. Furthermore, a decrease in hypertonia would 
greatly facilitate rehabilitation therapy and the ability for 
motor learning. Also, the video clearly shows the rabbits 
at P5 and P11 walking even with postural deficits. This 
is observed in humans to some extent, where there can 
be severe postural changes in the peripheral joints but 
the ability to walk is still retained or restored after an 
 insult.
  The study raises several translational research questions.
HUCBC from each delivery may be different in potency.
Screening for the effectiveness of HUCBC could be 
first tested in rabbits before use in humans. There are 
three mitigating factors that allow us to give xenogeneic 
HUCBC in rabbit newborns. First, the experiments were 
meant to be proof-of-concept studies justifying the use of 
autologous HUCBC in human newborn infants. Second, 
the newborn immunological response is known to be not 
as well developed as in adults  [52, 53] . This is also true for 
rabbits and rodents  [54] . Third, all the previous studies 
were done in newborn rodents without much response. 
Although we did not specifically study the immunological
response, we would expect an absence of a major immunological
reaction.
  At the moment, clinical trials are only using autologous
HUCBC. There is presently an ongoing clinical trial
of autologous HUCBC and hypothermia for term 
HIE, and preliminary studies show that it is safe and may 
be promising  [13] . Allogeneic cells have been tested in 
one randomized trial, along with erythropoietin, and 
this study had promising results  [41] . Ultimately, a future
topic clinically would be the feasibility of allogeneic
infusions because it would expand access to therapy 
with HUCBC in individuals with CP. However, before 
we reach that stage, fundamental issues must be addressed
such as which of the following mechanism of 
actions is used by HUCBC: (1) paracrine signaling, (2) 
growth factors, (3) stimulation of endogenous neuro-

genesis or (4) whether engraftment or tissue integration 
is needed. The clinical protocols for the use of allogeneic
cells in human infants with HIE would need careful 
study and optimization.
  In conclusion, our study adds supportive evidence for 
the use of HUCBC in neonatal HI brain injury. Further 
studies testing various dosing and timing strategies, infusions
before, during or after initiation of hypothermia 
and further investigating mechanisms are needed.
