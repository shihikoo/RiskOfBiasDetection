Germinal matrix hemorrhage remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants in the
United States with little progress made in its clinical management. Survivors are often afflicted with long-term
neurological sequelae, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, hydrocephalus, and psychiatric disorders.
Blood clots disrupting normal cerebrospinalfluid circulation and absorption after germinal matrix hemorrhage
are thought to be important contributors towards post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus development. We evaluated
if upregulating CD36 scavenger receptor expression in microglia and macrophages through PPARγstimulation,
which was effective in experimental adult cerebral hemorrhage models and is being evaluated clinically, will enhance
hematoma resolution and ameliorate long-term brain sequelae using a neonatal rat germinal matrix hemorrhage
model.PPARγstimulation (15d-PGJ
2
) increasedshort-term PPARγand CD36 expression levels aswell as
enhanced hematoma resolution, which was reversed by a PPARγantagonist (GW9662) and CD36 siRNA. PPARγ
stimulation (15d-PGJ
2
) also reduced long-term white matter loss and post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation as
well as improved neurofunctional outcomes, which were reversed by a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662). PPARγinduced
upregulation of CD36 in macrophages and microglia is, therefore, critical for enhancing hematoma resolution
and ameliorating long-term brain sequelae.

1. Introduction
The ganglionic eminence consists of neuronal and glial precursor
cells located at the head of the caudate nucleus below the lateral ventricles
of the developing fetus, and the highly vascularized region within
the subependymal tissue is the germinal matrix. Cerebral bloodflow
fluctuation associated with hemodynamic and respiratory instability
in preterm infants in conjunction with the inherent fragility of the germinal
matrix often leads to germinal matrix hemorrhage, a very common
and major neurological complication of prematurity. Germinal
matrix hemorrhage (GMH) occurs when immature blood vessels rupture
within the subependymal (or periventricular) germinal region of
the ganglionic eminence in the immature brain (Ballabh, 2010). In the
United States alone, GMH occurs in approximately 12,000 lives births
per year, and the number of moderate-to-severe GMH cases has
remained steady over the past two decades (Fanaroff et al., 2007; Jain
et al., 2009; Osterman et al., 2015). Clinical studies indicate GMH
afflicted infants often suffer from long-term neurological deficits, cerebral
palsy, mental retardation, hydrocephalus, and psychiatric disorders
(Ballabh, 2014; Kadri et al., 2006). Prenatal glucocorticoid treatment remains
the best treatment for preventing GMH, yet minimal advancements
have been made in GMH clinical management post-ictus
(Roberts and Dalziel, 2006; Shankaran et al., 1995).
Hemodynamic and respiratory instability in preterm infants results
influctuations of cerebral bloodflow in the inherently frail germinal
matrix vasculature, often resulting in spontaneous bleeding (Ballabh,
2014). The consequent hematoma applies mechanical pressure to glia
and neurons, resulting in cytotoxicity and necrosis, as well as evokes
an inflammatory response, leading to secretion of destructive proteases
and oxidative species (Lekic et al., 2015). In adult cerebral hemorrhage,
clinical studiesindicate hematomavolume is thebestprognostic indicator
; larger hematoma volumes have worsened outcomes (Keep et al.,
2005; Xi et al., 2006). Experimental adult cerebral hemorrhage studies
proved more rapid hematoma resolution is necessary for quickly ameliorating
inflammation and improving neurological recovery (Zhao
et al., 2007, 2009). Additionally, blood clots directly impair cerebrospinalfluid circulation and absorption after GMH, significantly contributing
towards post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus development (Aquilina
et al., 2011; Cherian et al., 2004). Therefore, we hypothesize enhancing
hematoma resolution will improve GMH outcomes.

Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system
and are critical drivers of the neuro-inflammatory response after GMH
and other hemorrhagic brain injuries (Aronowski and Zhao, 2011;
Tanget al.,2015).Activatedmicrogliarecruit hematogenous phagocytes
to the injured site, which engulf the hematoma as well as damaged or
dead tissue (Aronowski and Hall, 2005; Cox et al., 1995). The role microglia
play in hemorrhagic brain injury pathogenesis is different in neonates
than adults (Woo et al., 2012). Unlike the adult brain where
microglia cells and macrophages contribute to brain injury after stroke
through the production of inflammatory cytokines (Vexler and Yenari,
2009), neonatal brains demonstrate the opposite as the depletion of
these cells enhances injury by removing endogenous protective mechanisms
(Faustino et al., 2011).
Scavenger receptor CD36, a trans-membrane glycoprotein, is involved
in several biological functions, such as foam cell formation, immune
cell chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (Woo et al.,
2012). CD36 receptor is reportedly located on the cell surface of several
cell types, including monocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia. CD36
plays an important role in phagocytosis, and upregulating its expression
beneficially enhances hematoma resolution (Zhao et al., 2007). Transfection
of non-phagocytic cells with a CD36-expressing gene converted
those cells into phagocytes (Ren et al., 1995). CD36 genetic deletion
worsened injury after acute focal stroke in neonatal mice, partially by
decreasing removal of apoptotic cells (Woo et al., 2012).
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a
member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, plays a major
role in the upregulating CD36 expression (Zhao et al., 2007, 2009).
PPARγ stimulation exerts anti-inflammatory effects in several central
nervous system injuries and disorders (Landreth et al., 2008; Pereira
et al., 2005). Many studies demonstrated PPARγis neuroprotective in
various experimental stroke models (Pereira et al., 2005; Shao and Liu,
2015; Woo et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2007). In adult intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) experimental models, PPARγactivation was directly associated
with upregulation of CD36 expression, leading to enhanced
phagocytosis-mediated clearance of the hematoma as well as dead or
damaged cells by microglia and macrophages. PPARγ stimulation reduced
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, ameliorated secondary
brain injury, and improved functional recovery after ICH (Zhao et al.,
2007). Currently, PPARγ stimulation for enhancing hematoma resolution
and ameliorating secondary brain injury is being clinically tested
in ICH patients (Gonzales et al., 2013). Yet, no clinical trials are evaluating
PPARγstimulation in GMH patients.
In this study, we assess if PPARγ stimulation enhances CD36-
mediated hematoma resolution in a neonatal rat germinal matrix hemorrhage
model. We hypothesizePPARγstimulation,using15d-PGJ
2
, will
augment microglia/macrophage phagocytosis of blood clots, reducing
post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, inflammation, behavioral dysfunction
, and neuronal loss, which will be reversed by CD36 knockdown or
PPARγantagonist administration.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and surgeries
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health guidelines for the treatment of animals,
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Loma Linda University. Two hundred and sixty P7 Sprague–Dawley
neonatalpups (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing12–15g (brain development
is comparable to 30–32 week gestation humans) were used in
this study. Germinal matrix hemorrhage was achieved by stereotacticguided
injection of bacterial collagenase, as previously described
(Lekic et al., 2012). Pups were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (delivered
through medical grade oxygen and mixed air) while being stabilized
onto a stereotaxic frame. Isopropyl alcohol followed by betadine
was applied to the incision site. Incision was made on the longitudinal
plane to expose the skull and reveal bregma. The stereotactic coordinates
from bregma were as follows: 1.6 mm (rostral), 1.6 mm (right lateral
), and 2.8 mm (depth) from the dura. A burr hole (1 mm) was
drilled, into which a 27 gauge needle was inserted at a rate of 1 mm/
min. 0.3 units of clostridial collagenase VII-S (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) in
1μL was infused over a period of 3 min with a Hamilton syringe guided
by a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After
completing infusion, the needle is left into position for an additional
10 min after injection to prevent “back-leakage”and then removed at
a rate of 1 mm/min. Once the Hamilton is removed, the burr hole is
sealed with bone wax and the incision site sutured. Animals are then
given buprenorphine and allowed to recover on a 37 °C heated blanket.
When fully recovered, pups are then placed back with the mother. Surgery
time per animal is approximately 30 min. Sham animals were subject
to needle insertion without collagenase infusion. The same
procedures were performed for intraventricular injection of siRNA, except
the stereotactic coordinates from bregma were as follows:
1.0 mm (rostral), 1.0 mm (left lateral), and 1.8 mm (depth) of the dura.
2.2. Animal treatments and experimental groups
P7 rat pups were randomly divided into the followinggroups:shamoperated
(n = 38), Vehicle (n = 38), GMH + 15d-PGJ
2
(n = 38),
GMH + 15d-PGJ
2
+ GW9662 (n = 38), GMH + CD36 siRNA (n =
12), GMH + 15d-PGJ
2
+ CD36 (n = 12), GMH + scrambled siRNA
(n = 12). The PPARγagonist (15d-PGJ
2
, 0.1 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich), antagonist
(GW9662, 4 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) + agonist, and saline (for
sham and vehicle groups) were administered intraperitoneally to experimental
animals at 1 h post-GMH and then once daily for 7 days.
CD36 siRNA (1.2 ng, Cell Signaling & Santa Cruz), and scrambled
siRNA (1.2 ng, Santa Cruz) were administered via intraventricular injection
to experimental animals 24 h prior to GMH induction.
Buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously to all
groups after completing surgery.
2.3. Animal perfusion and tissue extraction
Animals were euthanized using isoflurane (≥5%) followed by transcardiac
perfusion with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for hemoglobin
assay and Western blot samples or with ice-cold PBS followed
by 10% formalin for histology samples. Forebrains for hemoglobin assay
and Western blot were snap-frozen with liquid-nitrogen, then stored in
−80 °C freezer before protein extractions or spectrophotometric quantification. Histological brain samples were post-fixed in 10%
Fomaldehyde for at least 3 days and then 30% sucrose for at least
3 days, all stored in 4 °C fridge. Forebrains were next embedded in Optimal
Cutting Temperature compound and stored in−20 °C freezer.
2.4. Hemoglobin assay
Spectrophotometric measurements were used to assess hemorrhagic
volume using well-established protocols (Choudhri et al., 1997; Lekic
et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2004). Frozen extracted forebrains were placed
into individual glass tubes containing 3 mL of PBS. The tissue was homogenized
for 60 s (Tissue Miser Homogenizer; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh
, PA) followed by ultrasonication for 1 min to lyse erythrocyte
membranes. The products were then centrifuged for 30 min and the supernatant
was separated from the pellets. A 4:1 ratio of Drabkin's reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich) and supernatant were combined, which were
left to react for 15 min. Absorbance, using a spectrophotometer
(540 nm; Genesis 10uv; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), was
calculated into a hemorrhagic volume (μL) on the basis of a standard
curve as routinely performed (Lekic et al., 2011).

2.5. Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements
At 28 days post-ictus, animals were anesthetized and mounted onto
a stereotaxic frame, where the head was inclined downward at a 30 degree
angle. A midline skin incision was made to expose the atlantooccipital
membrane. The cisterna magna was punctured with a 26G
Hamilton needle, which was connected to a pressure transducer of a
Digi-Med LPA 400-low pressure Analyzer (Micro-Med-Louisville, Kentucky
, USA) as described (Lackner et al., 2013).
2.6. Western blotting
Protein concentrations for immunoblot (Lekic et al., 2011)weredetermined
by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 30μg protein per
sample were loaded into wells of 4–20% gels, ranfor 30 min at 50 V then
90 min at 125 V, then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at
0.3 A for 120 min (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated for 2 h in 5%
non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween20. Then
the following primary antibodies were incubated overnight: anti-
PPARγ (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas), CD36 (1:500, Santa Cruz,
Dallas, Texas), and mannose receptor (CD206) (1:500, ABcam, Cambridge
, Massachusetts). Secondary antibodies (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology
, Santa Cruz, CA) were then applied to the membranes and
incubated for 2 h and then processed with the ECL plus Kit (GE
Healthcare and Life Science, Piscataway, NJ).β-actin was used as an internal
control against the anti-body (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA). ImageJ software (4.0, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring,
MD) was used to analyze the relative density of the resultant protein
immunoblot images as described (Tang et al., 2004).
2.7. Histological volumetric analysis
10μm thick coronal brain sections were cut every 600μm using a
cryostat (Leica Microsystems LM3050S) and were placed onto poly-L-
lysine-coated slides. Brain slices were Nissl stained morphometrically
analyzed using computer-assisted (ImageJ 4.0, Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, MD) hand delineation of the ventricle system (lateral,
third, cerebral aqueduct, and fourth), hemisphere (cortex, subcortex),
caudate, thalamus, hippocampus, and corpus callosum (white matter)
(Lekic et al., 2011). These structures were delineated using optical dissector
principles from prior stereological studies (Avendano et al.,
2005; Bermejo et al., 2003; Ekinci et al., 2008; Klebe et al., 2014;
Oorschot, 1996; Reisert et al., 1984; Tang et al., 2001). Volumes were
calculated using the following equation: average (area of coronal
section)×section interval× number of sections(MacLellanet al.,2008).
2.8. Immunohistochemistry
10μm thick slices werefirst stained with OX-42 (1:1000, ABcam)
and mannose receptor (1:1000, ABcam) overnight at 4 °C, followed by
incubation with appropriate fluorescence conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). The perihemorrhagic
area was imaged by a Fluorescent Olympus-BX51 microscope
and analyzed using MagnaFire SP 2.1B software (Olympus, Melville
, NY). At least six sections per animal group over a microscopic

as described (Wang and Dore, 2007).
2.9. Neurobehavioral analysis
Neurobehavioral function was evaluated in a blinded manner using
a battery of tests, described below, to detect sensorimotor and cognitive
deficits 28 days after GMH as previously described (Hartman et al.,
2009; Klebe et al., 2014): Foot Fault Test: Rats were placed on a wire
grid (20 × 40 cm) kept above the floor level and allowed to walk on
the grid for 2 min. Number of foot faults will be recorded when a complete
paw falls through the openings in the grid. Rotarod Test: Rats
were placed on a rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH),
which consists of a rotating horizontal cylinder (7 cm diameter) divided
into 9.5-cm-wide lanes. Rats walked forward when the cylinder is rotatingtoavoid
falling down.Rats weretestedata starting5 RPMor 10RPM
with acceleration at 2 RPM per 5 s. A photobeam circuit detected the latency
to fall off the cylinder.Water Maze Test: Rats were released in a
metal pool (110 cm diameter)filled with water and containing spatial
cues on the walls, and they were allowed to swim tofind a submerged
platform (11 cm diameter). Each animal performed 10 trials per day for
4 days, 5 blocks of 2 consecutive trials, with a 10-min interval between
successive blocks. Over the next 3 days, the platform was submerged
1 cm below the water and surface and the rats had tofind and remember
the platform location. Additionally, at the end of each day, the platform
was removed and animals were allowed to swim to find the
platform quadrant. An overhead camera with a computerized tracking
system (Noldus Ethovision; Noldus, Tacoma, WA) recorded the swim
path and measured the swim distance, swim speed, and time spent in
probe quadrant.

A power analysis using a type I error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.8
on a2-sidedtest wasusedtoestimate sample size. Dataare expressedin
Mean ± Standard Deviation. One-way ANOVA on ranks using the Student–Newman–Keuls post-hoc test was used to analyze behavioral, histological

3. Results
3.1. PPARγ stimulation ameliorated long-term neurological deficits
The vehicle group performed significantly worse compared to sham
in the Morris Water Maze evaluation, yet PPARγstimulation improved
spatial learning and memory compared to vehicle and was not significantly
different from sham. Treatment effect was reversed by the
PPARγ antagonist (*P b 0.05 versus Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle;
†Pb0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig. 1A,B). Treatment also significantly
improved sensorimotor function in the foot fault test compared
to other GMH groups (*Pb0.05 versus Sham; #Pb0.05 versus Vehicle;
†Pb0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig. 1C). Yet no significant difference
was achieved in the treated group compared to vehicle and antagonist
groups in the rotarod sensorimotor evaluation (*P b 0.05 versus
Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle; †P b 0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-
PGJ
2
;Fig. 1D).
3.2. PPARγ stimulation improved long-term brain morphology
Since increased intracranial pressure is associated with hydrocephalus
, ICP was measured in rats at 4 weeks post-ictus. ICP was significantly
decreased in treated groups when compared to vehicle and PPARγantagonist
groups (*P b 0.05 versus Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle;
†Pb0.05versusGW9662+ 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig.2B).Calculated cortical thickness
is presented as a ratio to the mean of sham and was significantly
deceased in the vehicle and PPARγ antagonist group, but the PPARγ
stimulated group had significantly less cortical loss (*P b 0.05 versus
Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle; †P b 0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-
PGJ
2
;Fig. 3A). Ventricular volume was significantly increased in vehicle
and PPARγ antagonist groups, but 15d-PGJ
2
treatment reduced posthemorrhagic
ventricular dilation (*Pb0.05 versus Sham; #Pb0.05 versus
Vehicle;†Pb0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig. 3B). White matter
loss is presented as a percentage of white matter present to mean of
sham. White matter loss was reduced by PPARγstimulation, but vehicle
and PPARγ antagonist groups had significant white matter loss
(*P b 0.05 versus Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle; †P b 0.05 versus
GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig. 3C). Basal ganglia loss is presented as a percentage
of basal ganglia present to mean of sham. The 15d-PGJ
2
treated
group had significantly decreased basalganglialoss compared to the vehicle
group. Surprisingly, basal ganglia loss in the GW9662 group was
not significantly different from PPARγ agonist or vehicle groups
(*P b 0.05 versus Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle; †P b 0.05 versus
GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;Fig. 3D).
3.3. PPARγstimulation enhanced hematoma resolution, increased activated
microglia, induce M2 polarization
A hemoglobin assay time-course was conducted at 24 h, 72 h, and
7 days to determine PPARγ's role in hematoma resolution. At 24 h, all
groups had significantly greater hemoglobin content in the brain compared
to sham (*Pb0.05 versus Sham;Fig. 4A). At 72 h, all groups had significantly greater hemoglobin content in the brain compared to sham, but
15d-PGJ
2
treatment had significantly less hemoglobin content compared
to vehicle, which was reversed by GW9662 treatment (*P b 0.05 versus
Sham; #P b 0.05 versus Vehicle; †Pb 0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ
2
;
Fig. 4B). At 7 days, only the vehicle and PPARγantagonist groups had significantly greater hemoglobin content compared to sham, but the PPARγ
agonist group had significantly less hemoglobin content compared to vehicle
and PPARγ antagonist groups (*P b 0.05 versus Sham; #P b 0.05

group at 72 h, representative photographs of immuno-stained
activated microglia/macrophages (OX-42) in the peri-hematoma region
are presented at this time point (Fig. 5A). The 15d-PGJ
2
treated group
had relatively increased number of microglia/macrophage compared to
sham, vehicle, and PPARγ antagonist group ((*P b 0.05 versus Sham;

of activated microglia/macrophages (OX-42) and mannose receptor

3.4. PPARγ stimulation increased CD36 and PPARγ expression at 72 h
A time-course study was conducted to determine endogenous
PPARγ and CD36 expression levels in GMH at 0, 3, 6, 12 h and 1, 3, 5,
and 7 days after GMH. Endogenous PPARγexpression was significantly
increasedat3,6,12hand1daycomparedto0h(*Pb0.05 versus 0 h;
Fig. 6A). Correspondingly, endogenous CD36 expression was significantly
increased at 3, 6, 12 h, and 1 day compared to 0 h (*Pb0.05 versus
0 h;Fig. 6B), and tended to remain elevated by 7 days. PPARγand
CD36 expression levels were determined at 72 h for all experimental
groups. PPARγ expression was significantly increased in the 15d-PGJ
2
group compared to all other groups (*P b0.05 versus Sham; #Pb0.05
versus Vehicle; †P b 0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ

Fig. 6C). Much
like PPARγ, CD36 expression was significantly increased in the 15d-
PGJ
2
group compared to all other groups (*P b 0.05 versus Sham;
#Pb0.05 versus Vehicle;†Pb0.05 versus GW9662 + 15d-PGJ

Fig. 6D).
3.5. CD36 knockdown reversed PPARγ agonist-enhanced hematoma resolution
and M2 expression at 72 h
At 72 h, CD36 knockdown reversed PPARγagonist-enhanced hematoma
resolution, which was not reversed in the scrambled siRNA group
(*Pb0.05 versus Sham, #Pb0.05 versus Vehicle, %Pb0.05 versus CD-36

4. Discussion
Neonatal brain hemorrhage is a common affliction of premature infants.
The resultant hematoma is thought to play a major role in causing
post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus development because blood clots disrupt
cerebrospinal fluid circulation and absorption in the ventricles
(Crews et al., 2004). Rapid hematoma resolution was neuroprotective
in adult hemorrhagic stroke models (Zhao et al., 2007, 2015). In particular

. This study is thefirst to assess this treatment approach in
neonates for enhancing hematoma resolution as well as thefirst to evaluate
its therapeutic potential for ameliorating long-term white matter
loss, post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus development, and neurological
deficits.
We evaluated the efficacy of 15d-PGJ
2
treatment, a PPARγagonist,
administered 1 h post-ictus as a potential therapeutic modality for
GMH-induced brain injury. Although treatment did not significantly increase
hematoma resolution at 24 h, it did significantly enhance hematoma
resolution at 72 h and 7 days after GMH (Fig. 4A–C). PPARγ
stimulation demonstrated more rapid hematoma clearance after GMH
in neonates, starting at 72 h, than after ICH in adults, which took
7 days (Zhao et al., 2007). 15d-PGJ

treatmenteffectson enhanced hematoma
resolution at 72 h and 7 days after GMH. To determine if endogenous
expression of PPARγ and CD36 changes after GMH, we
performed a Western blot time course using 0, 3, 6, 12 h, 1, 3, 5, and
7 day endpoints following GMH induction. Endogenous PPARγexpression
increased at 3, 6, 12 h, and 1 day after GMH induction, then
returned to baseline by 3 days (Fig. 6A). Endogenous CD36 expression
significantly increased at 3, 6, 12 h, and 1 day after GMH induction,
and tended to remain elevated through 7 days (Fig. 6B). Because endogenous
PPARγand CD36 expression returned near baseline at 72 h and
because 15d-PGJ
2
treatment enhanced hematoma resolution at 72 h,
we determined treatment effects on PPARγand CD36 expression levels
by Western blot at 72 h. As expected, 15d-PGJ
2
treatment significantly
increased PPARγ expression compared to sham and vehicle, and 15d-
PGJ
2
co-administration with GW9662 reversed this effect (Fig. 6C). Similarly
, 15d-PGJ
2
treatment significantly increased CD36 expression compared
to sham and vehicle, and 15d-PGJ
2
co-administration with
GW9662 reversed this effect (Fig. 6D).
CD36 receptor is an important scavenger receptor located on several
cell types, including monocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia/macrophages.
CD36 plays an important role in microglia/macrophage phagocytosis
, and upregulating its expression beneficially enhances
hematoma resolution (Zhao et al., 2007). More activated microglia
were observed in the peri-hematoma region of treated GMH animals
than all other groups, providing evidence of PPARγ's treatment effects
are dependent upon these critical immune cells (Fig. 5A, B). All GMH
groups seemed to have increased DAPI stained cells post-ictus compared
to sham. The germinal matrix has many growing and dividing
neuronal and glial precursor cells. Prior GMH studies have documented
increased proliferative cytokines and pathways, such as TGF-β and
mTOR, after injury, and we speculate proliferative signaling triggers
more profound gliosis after neonatal brain hemorrhage (Lekic et al.,
2015). While brain cell death is definitely occurring, we speculate

proliferative signaling in conjunction with increased leukocyte infiltration
contributes towards these observed results in neonatal brains.
Although activated microglia/macrophages contribute to brain injury
in adults, some evidence suggests microglia/macrophages have important
defense mechanisms against injury in neonates, which could be
explained bythevital role microgliaplayin neonatalbrain development
(Faustino et al., 2011; Harry and Kraft, 2012). Furthermore, activated microglia
/macrophages have two differentiated states, a pro-inflammatory
classically activated state (M1), and an immune dampening and tissue regenerative
alternatively activated state (M2) (Klebe et al., 2015). CD36
stimulation can contribute towards microglia/macrophage activation as
well as M2 polarization (Chavez-Sanchez et al., 2014; Kouadir et al.,
2012; Rios et al., 2013). PPARγstimulation also polarizes microglia/macrophages
towards the M2 state (Penas et al., 2015; Pisanu et al., 2014;
Yoon et al., 2008). To corroborate thesefindings in GMH, immunohistochemical
co-localization of activated microglia and mannose receptor
(CD206), an M2 marker, demonstrated increased co-expression in 15d-
PGJ
2
treated GMH animals compared to other groups, providing more evidence
PPARγinduces M2 polarization (Fig. 5A). Similarly, CD206 Western
blots demonstrated increased CD206 expression levels in treated
GMH animals compared to sham, GMH animals with CD36 siRNA alone,
and GMH animals with CD36 siRNA and 15d-PGJ
2
treatment. Interestingly
, vehicle treated GMH animals showed a small tendency towards having
increased CD206 expression levels, which also did not achieve a statistically
significant difference compared to 15d-PGJ
2
treated GMH animals.
After hemorrhage, M2 microglia/macrophages are expected to increase
over time as the peri-hematoma milieu transitions into an immune
dampened tissue repair phase in which M2 microglia/macrophages play
a pivotal role (Klebe et al., 2015). CD36 knockdown eliminated the
tendency observed in the vehicle group, achieving a significantly reduced
expression compared to 15d-PGJ
2
treatment. CD36 knockdown also reversed
15d-PGJ
2
induced upregulation of CD206 expression (Fig. 5C).
CD36, thus, is important for M2 polarization, particularly after PPARγ
stimulation. To further confirm microglial/macrophage CD36 plays a pivotal
role in PPARγ-induced blood clot clearance, siRNA was used to
knockdown CD36 expression. CD36 knockdown reversed 15d-PGJ
2
treatment
effects on enhanced hematoma resolution at 72 h, which was not
reversed by scrambled siRNA (Fig. 4D).
In our long-term evaluations, vehicle treated GMH animals had significant cortical, white matter, and basal ganglia loss as well as posthemorrhagic
ventricular dilation, but 15d-PGJ
2
treatment ameliorated
these brain morphological maladies,which were reversed by PPARγantagonist
, GW9662, co-administration (Fig. 3A–D). Surprisingly,
GW9662 co-administration did not completely reverse 15d-PGJ
2
's effects
on reducing basal ganglia loss, although a tendency was observed.
Our ICP measurements agreed with the brain morphological assessment
, where ICP levels were significantly lower in treated groups
when compared to vehicle and PPARγantagonist group (Fig. 2B). Additionally
, vehicle treated GMH animals performed poorly in the Morris
Water Maze, Foot Fault, and Rotarod tests, but 15d-PGJ
2
treatment significantly improved spatialmemoryandmotorfunction,whichwere reversed
by GW9662 co-administration (Fig. 1A–D). The foot fault test
evaluates locomotor function, the rotarod test evaluates sensorimotor
coordination and balance, and Morris Water Maze evaluates spatial
learning and memory (Schaar et al., 2010). Although 15d-PGJ2 reduced
the number of foot faults, it did not significantly improve performance
in the rotarod test. GMH and consequent post-hemorrhagic ventricular
dilation may cause cerebellar injury that affects motor coordination

investigations are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology between
GMH and cerebellar injury. Although motor coordination is an
important factor in both the rotarod and foot fault tests, the element
of balancing on an accelerating cylinder platform leads us to speculate
cerebellar injury may more profoundly affect performances in the
rotarod evaluations. 15d-PGJ2 treatment may not be effective enough
to ameliorate potential cerebellar injury from GMH and consequent
post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, and, if this is the case, modulating
the immune response after GMH may not be sufficient to promote complete
functional recovery. Additionally, the rotarod test may not be sensitive
enough for detecting improved sensorimotor outcomes in
treatment groups, which is why we performed multiple
neurofunctional evaluations. Nonetheless, these results provide sufficient
evidence that enhanced hematoma resolution corresponds with
improved long-term brain morphological and neurocognitive outcomes
after GMH. Most importantly, more rapid blood clot clearance resulted
in significantly decreased post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation, providing
evidence that blood products play an important role in posthemorrhagic
hydrocephalus development.
The CD36 scavenger receptor is importantin microglia/macrophagemediated
phagocytosisof cellulardebris andblood products.Our results
suggest PPARγ stimulation by 15d-PGJ
2
increases microglia/macrophage
phagocytic function by upregulatingCD36scavenger receptor expression
in our experimental GMH model, leading to enhanced
hematoma resolution. We are first to report the positive long-term
effects on brain morphological and neurofunctional outcomes from
more efficient hematoma resolution after GMH. Blood products disrupt
cerebrospinal circulation and absorption in the cerebroventricular
system, often resulting in post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Herein,
we provide evidence that more rapid blood clot clearance reduces
long-term post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation after GMH. Removing
the hematoma without damaging surrounding tissues is ideal and clinically
relevant. PPARγstimulation could be a promising therapeutic approach
for GMH patients, especially since PPARγ stimulation by
Pioglitazoneis alreadybeingevaluated in clinical trials for adult cerebral
hemorrhage.
