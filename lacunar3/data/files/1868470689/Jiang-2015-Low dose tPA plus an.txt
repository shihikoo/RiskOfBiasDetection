abstract
We previously have shown that tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) in combination with its receptor
annexin A2 (rA2) protein significantly improved tPA thrombolytic efficacy. In this study we aimed
to examine the therapeutic effects of the combination when treated at delayed 4-hour window after
stroke compared to standard conventional tPA alone in an embolic focal stroke rat model. We compared
effects of intravenous tPA alone (10 mg/kg) versus a combination of low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) plus
10 mg/kg rA2. Totally 152 rats were used. Our results showed that: (1) at 24 h after stroke, the combination
slightly reduced brain infarction compared to saline (9.2% reduction), and tPA (7.4% reduction), although
the reductions did not reach statistical significance; while the combination significantly reduced (22.2%
reduction) the conventional tPA-elevated intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) transformation; (2) at 7 days
after stroke, the combination significantly attenuated conventional tPA alone-elevated iron deposition
at peri-lesion area (68.2% reduction); (3) at 28 days after stroke, the combination significantly improved
performance of adhesive tape-removal test, which was accompanied by a significantly higher micro vessel
density at peri- infarct areas compared to conventional tPA alone group.In conclusion, compared to
conventional tPA alone, when treated at delayed 4-hour after stroke, the combination of low-dose tPA
plus rA2 therapy provides a safer profile by lowering risk of ICH transformation and improves neurological
function recovery after stroke.

ischemic brain via restoring blood flow. However, the short therapeutic
time window, ICH transformation, poor thrombolytic
perfusion rate, and neurotoxicity comprise major limitations to its
use[1–3]. Annexin A2 is a cell-surface protein that can forma triple
complex with tPA and plasminogen, which increases the catalytic
efficiency of tPA, enabling it to convert plasminogen to plasmin
more efficiently in about 60 fold than same amount of tPA alone
in vitro[4]. However, clinically giving large amount of tPA alone but
without fibrinolytic assembly of the tPA-annexin A2-plasminogen

complex formation, makes tPA converting plasminogen to plasmin
inefficiently, which may be partially responsible for the shortcomings
of tPA reperfusion therapy[4]. Our previous experiments have
shown that low- dose tPA combining with its “amplifier” rA2 is
more effective than conventional tPA alone when treated within
3 h after focal embolic stroke in rats [5–7].
The rationale of this study was mainly based on clinical observation
that even within the 3-hour time window, intravenous tPA only
induce partial or complete reperfusion in about 50% stroke patients,
while another 50% patients had no reperfusion (non-responders)
at all. These 50% non- responders are not benefited by the tPA
reperfusion treatment, but face a higher risk of ICH transformation.
Furthermore, the lower reperfusion efficacy and higher hemorrhage
risk are also positively associated with treatment time [8].
The purpose of the present study was to ask whether the tPA plus
rA2 combination therapy is more efficacious or/and safer compared
to the conventional tPA alone, when the treatment time window is
delayed at 4 h after stroke in a embolic focal stroke model of rats.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Focal embolic cerebral ischemia in rats
All experiments were performed following an institutionally
approved protocol in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male
Wistar rats (280–330 g) were subjected to focal embolic stroke as
we previously described [9]. For this translational study, all stroke
therapy academic industry roundtable (STAIR) recommendations
and RIGOR guidelines for effective translational research were followed
in terms of randomization, blinding and statistical powering
[10,11]. Rats were treated with either saline, or high-dose tPA
(10 mg/kg) alone, or combination of low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) plus
rA2 (10 mg/kg). Recombinant human tPA (alteplase) was purchased
from Genentech. Recombinant annexin A2 (rA2) was produced as
previously described[7]. The rA2 was mixed with tPA for 30 min at
37 ◦C before intravenous infusion.Animals were anesthetized with
1% to 2% isoflurane under spontaneous respiration in a 30% oxygen
/70% nitrous oxide mixture. Rats were anesthetized again when
treatment were administered. An initial 10% bolus was followed by
infusion of the remaining drug over 30 min using a syringe pump.
Inclusion criteria was set as: (1) stable 50% or less regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) of pre-ischemic baseline for up to 1 h after
embolization; (2) Modified neurological severity score (mNSS) at
3 h after stroke is ≥8 as we previously established [5]. Totally 152
rats were used.
2.2. Measurements of brain infarct size, intracerebral
hemorrhagic volume and mortality at 24 h after stroke onset
Seven coronal brain sections (2 mm thick) were stained with
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) to quantify infarct
size using computer-assisted image analysis. The TTC stained brain
sections were used for quantification of intracerebral hemorrhagic
volume with spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay as we previously
described[7,9].Within 24 h after stroke onset, dead rats were
counted for mortality rate.
2.3. Measurements of iron deposition and mortality at 7 days
after stroke
It has been reported iron deposition was peaked after 7 days and
remaining at a high level thereafter for at least 14 days following
ICH in rats [12]. At 7 days after stroke, we detected iron deposition
using the Accustain Iron Kit (Sigma–Aldrich) by following manufacture
’s instructions [13,14]. For semi-quantitative analysis, on
three coronal sections (20-m thick, at 2-mm interval) at −0.8,
−2.8 and −4.8 mm from bregma (the maximal brain infarct area),
five consecutive fields (×200 magnification) along with subcortical
peri-infarct area of each section (totally 15 fields per brain) were
digitized for determining iron pigment (blue color). Severity of iron
deposition was expressed as positive rate of iron deposition presented
as the number of iron pigment in observed fields divided
by total scanned fields.Within 7 days after stroke onset, dead rats
were accounted for mortality rate.
2.4. Assessments of neurological function deficits
Foot fault test and mNSS for motor coordination function, adhesive
tape- removal test for sensorimotor neurological deficits were
assessed on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after stroke by following
standard methods [15–17].
2.5. Measurements of brain infarction and mortality at 28 days
after stroke
H&E staining was used to quantify ischemic brain infarction size
at 28 days after stroke as we previously described [17]. Within 28
days after stroke, dead animals were counted for mortality rates.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry and semi-quantification
At 28 days after stroke, immunohistochemistry was performed
to determine surrogate biomarkers for neurovascular remodeling
in peri-infarct area on three coronal sections at −0.8, −2.8 and
−4.8 mm from bregma (the maximal brain infarct area) by following
standard methods [17]. Primary antibodies against Von
Willebrand factor (vWF) (Abbiotec, San Diego), Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) (Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), and synaptophysin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used.
Vessel density (vWF-positive vessels on 3 fields per section in periinfarct
cortex) was quantitated as percentage of vWF positive vessel
area; VEGF expression (positive cells area on 3 fields per section in
peri-infarct cortex) and synaptophysin expression (positive signals
on 3 fields per section in peri-infarct cortex) was quantitated as
mean optical density, as we previously described [5].
2.7. Statistical analysis
Infarction and hemorrhage volumes, and immunohistochemistry
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Mortality rate was
analyzed by two-sided Fisher’s exact test. Neurobehavioral assessments
were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA followed by
post-hoc t-test. The most conservative multiple-test correction
was applied using the Bonferroni method. Differences with P< 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Low-dose tPA plus rA2 combination reduces ICH volume at 1
day after stroke
At one day after stroke, infraction volume (% of hemisphere)
of the combination group (36.5±6.8) was 9.2% and 7.4% smaller
than saline group (40.2±7.3) and tPA alone group (39.4±7.5),
respectively. While, ICH volume (l/hemisphere) was significantly
increased in tPA alone group (7.34±1.25) compared to saline
control (3.62±1.27), importantly the tPA-elevated ICHwas significantly
attenuated by the combination treatment (5.71±1.85, 22%
reduction, P< 0.05) (Fig. 1). No significant difference of one-day

3.2. Low-dose tPA plus rA2 combination eliminates iron
deposition in peri- lesion area at 7 days after stroke
At 7 days after stroke, positive rate of iron deposition in subcortical
peri-infarct areas was significantly increased in tPA alone group
(21.1%±0.13) for about 6.4 fold of saline group (3.3%±0.04), but it
was significantly reduced by the combination (6.7%±0.07, 68.2%
reduction) (Fig. 2). Additionally, we found there was a decline of 7-
day mortality in the combination group (20%, 2/8) compared to the
saline (50%, 4/8) and conventional tPA alone (37.5%, 3/8) groups,
but the difference was not statistically significant.

neurological outcomes
3 Neurobehavioral tests were assessed at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21
and 28 after stroke. No significant differences were detected in two
neurobehavioral tests, mNSS score and foot fault tests between the
two groups. However, the combination group had a significant better
performance in adhesive tape-removal test compared with tPA
alone group at both 14 and 28 days, and between the two treatments
(Fig. 3). No significant differences in brain infarction volume
between conventional tPA alone (23.2±4.5%) and the combination
(22.6±3.2%), and in 28-day mortality between conventional tPA
alone (32.4%, 11/34) and the combination (26.5%, 9/34) groups were
detected.

group was significantly higher (5.1%) compared to the
tPA alone group(3.5%,P< 0.05), demonstratinga significantly higher
cerebrovascular density of the combination group at the periinfarct
cortex (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
Our previous studies have shown that the same dose regimen of
rA2 plus low dose tPA combination may be a promising combination
approach for improving both reperfusion efficacy and reducing
ICH at early 3-hour time window [5–7]. The purpose of the present
study was to ask whether the low dose tPA plus rA2 combination is
still more beneficial than the conventional tPA alone when treated
at a delayed 4- hour time window after stroke.
Three sets of experiments were performed. In the first set
experiment, we examined ischemic brain infarction and hemorrhagic
volumes at 24 h after stroke. We found a resistance of tPA
thrombolytic reperfusion when treated at delayed 4 h,which was
in consistence with previous reports [18]. The thrombolytic reperfusion
resistance was reflected by the similar infarct size between
saline and conventional tPA alone groups, and limited infarction
reduction by the combination (9.2% reduction) compared to saline
(Fig. 1), however the combination significantly reduced hemorrhagic
transformation (22.2% reduction) compared to tPA alone
(Fig. 1). Clinically, even within the 3-hour time window, intravenous
tPA only induces partial or complete reperfusion to about
50% stroke patients. Unfortunately, we are unable to predict who
are the tPA reperfusion responders or non-responders before giving
tPA clinically. These 50% non-responders are not benefited by
the tPA reperfusion treatment, but face a higher risk of complications
of tPA thrombolytic therapy-associated ICH transformation
[8]. A clinical investigation reported that 3-month mortality was
about 60% to ischemic stroke patients with ICH after receiving intravenous
tPA administration[19]. Therefore the significantly lower
hemorrhagic transformation (22.2%) by the combination treatment
is translationally significant.
Brain tissue iron deposition is a common histological biomarker
peaked at one week after ICH, and also one of key pathogenic
factors that contributes to hemorrhagic brain damage [12,20]. In 
the second set experiment, at 7 days after stroke the combination
significantly decreased hemorrhagic iron deposition (68.2 %
reduction) compared to conventional tPA-alone group (Fig. 2).
Additionally, there was a lower 7-day mortality in the combination
group (25%, 2/8) compared to saline (50%, 4/8) and tPA alone group
(37.5%, 3/8). Although the difference of mortality did not reach statistical
significance, it might be at least partially due to the smaller
sample size examined. The significant reduction of brain iron deposition
at sub-acute phase suggested the combination may result in
less hemorrhagic brain damage.
In the last set experiment, we aimed to ask whether the significant
reduction of ICH by the combination at acute phase may
sustain to a significantly improved long-term neurological function
compared to tPA alone. We found there was no significant difference
in brain infarct size and mortality between the two treatments
at 28 days after stroke. However,the combination group showed a
significant better performance in adhesive tape-removal test compared
with tPA alone group at both 14 and 28 days, and between
the two treatment groups (Fig. 3).
Since cerebrovascular remodeling has been thought a key
endogenous recovery mechanism [21], in an exploratory experiment
, we measured and compared representative surrogate
markers for neurovascular remodeling in peri-infarct tissue at 28
days after stroke [5]. We found the combination group had a significantly
higher microvessel density at peri-lesion area (Fig. 4),
suggesting the combination did not dampen, and might slightly
augment recovery mechanisms of neurovascular remodeling compared
to the standard conventional tPA alone.
We are aware there are several limitations in our present
study. Firstly, it would be ideal to have non-treatment saline group
enrolled in the long term survival experiment. We did not include
saline group was due to that in our 7-day survival experiment,
we found about 50% mortality (4/8) within one week in saline
control rats, and speculated the 4-week mortality might be unacceptably
higher than 50%. (2) Since tPA alone did not, and the
combination only reduced 9.2% of brain infarction compared to
saline control at 24 h after stroke, suggested a limited reperfusion
might be achieved by the combination but not tPA alone, which
might be considered as “non-responders” to those tPA treated rats.
(3) However, the tPA alone-elevated hemorrhagic volume at 24 h
after stroke was significantly attenuated (22.2% reduction) by the
combination. So we believed without saline control we might still
be able to examine at least whether the significant acute hemor-

rhagic transformation reduction by the combination could sustain
to a significantly improved long-term neurological function compared
to tPA alone. Nevertheless, it is translationally important that
saline control needs to be tested and compared in future preclinical
investigations.
Secondly, underlying molecular mechanism for the better neurological
function recovery of the combination remains to be
further investigated. We might speculate that in addition to
the reduction in tPA-associated ICH transformation, the lower
tPA dose and formed rA2-tPA complex might limit tPA brain
penetration-associated neuronal excitotoxicity[22], and rA2 might
bind and neutralize angiostatin (one of tPA-plasminogen converting
products)-associated endothelial toxicity [23]. Ultimately,
decreased hemorrhagic brain damage and fewer neurovascular side
effects of the combination treatment might translate into better
vascular remodeling and improved long-term neurological outcome [4].
Thirdly, our focal embolic stroke model of rats used in this
study showed tPA thrombolytic resistance when treated at 4 h after
stroke onset, which does not very closely mimic clinically eligible
4.5 h therapeutic time window [24]. Development of a delayed tPA
treatment–responder model by modifying clot preparation for further
preclinical evaluation of the combination approach would be
translationally important. Lastly, other preclinical pharmacology-

related aspects need to be fully evaluated in the future, including
dose regimen optimization, testing in animal models carrying
stroke comorbidities, and safety related issues[10].
In conclusion, compared to conventional high-dose tPA alone,
when treated at delayed 4-hour time point after stroke, the combination
of low-dose tPA plus rA2 therapy provides a safer profile
by lowering risk of ICH transformation and improves recovery after
stroke. Further translational development of this tPA plus rA2 combination
stroke therapy may be warranted.
