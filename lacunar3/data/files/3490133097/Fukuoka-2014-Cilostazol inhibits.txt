Cilostazol Inhibits Platelet–Endothelial Cell Interaction
in Murine Microvessels after Transient Bilateral Common
Carotid Artery Occlusion
Takuya Fukuoka, MD, Takeshi Hayashi, MD, Makiko Hirayama,
Hajime Maruyama, MD, and Norio Tanahashi, MD
Background:The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cilostazol on
platelet behavior (rolling and adhesion) in murine cerebral microvessels after transient
bilateral carotid artery occlusion using intravital fluorescence microscopy.
Methods: We used 41 C57BL/6J mice for the experiment. Fourteen mice were used
as sham group (no ischemia and reperfusion, no medication); an ischemia (induced
by 15-minute occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries) and reperfusion (I/R)
group (n5 17); and an I/R1 cilostazol (I/R1 CZ) group (receiving 30 mg/kg of
cilostazol orally at 30 minutes before ischemia) (n510). A cranial window was prepared
in the right parietal region. Platelets obtained from donor mice were labeled
with a fluorescent dye (carboxyfluorescein iodoacetate succinimidyl ester) in vitro.
Labeled platelets were intravenously administered at 3 or 6 hours after reperfusion,
and then platelet behavior (rolling and adhesion) in the brain microvessels was observed.
The numbers of rolling and adhering platelets in the arteriole and venule
were calculated.Results:Numbers of rolling and adherent platelets at 3 and 6 hours
after reperfusion were significantly higher in the I/R group than in the sham or
I/R1CZ groups in both venule (P,.05) and arteriole (P,.05).Conclusions:Cilostazol
inhibits platelet–endothelial interactions following cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion. Key Words: Mouse—cerebral ischemia—platelet—endothelial cell—
cilostazol—brain microvessels.

Introduction
In brain microvessels under ischemic conditions, platelets1-7 and leukocytes8-13 roll and adhere to endothelial
cells. These interactions continue even after relief from the
ischemic insult, resulting in impaired microcirculation
and subsequent exacerbation of brain damage. Inhibition
of these interactions could help ameliorate ischemic brain
damage, particularly in thrombolytic therapy.
Clinically, cilostazol has been used for secondary prevention
of cerebral infarction in Japan. A large clinical
trial (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study II) has shown
that cilostazol is superior to aspirin in terms of secondary
stroke prevention.14Cilostazol, a type III phosphodiesterase
inhibitor, increases intracellular levels of cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),15inhibits platelet aggregation
, and also increases nitric oxide (NO) production
leading to improvement of endothelial cell function.
However, in vivo study of cilostazol on interaction between
platelets and endothelial cell has not been fully investigated.
The present study, therefore, investigated the
effects of cilostazol on interactions between platelets
and endothelial cells in brain microvessels after transient
ischemia.

Materials and Methods
Animal Preparations
Experiments were performed with 41 male C57Bl/6J
mice (8-10 weeks old; body weight, 20-28 g). The animals
wereanesthetizedbyintraperitonealinjectionofchloralhydrateat.3mg
/kg.Thefemoralartery wascannulatedusing
a polyethylene catheter (Intramedic PE10; Clay Adams,
Parsippany, NJ) to monitor mean arterial blood pressure
and arterial blood gas levels. Rectal temperature was monitoredandmaintainedat37Cusinganoverheadheatlamp
throughout the experimental procedure (Table 1).
Common Carotid Artery Occlusion and Brain
Preparation
After making a ventral midline cervical incision, the
common carotid arteries were exposed bilaterally and
clipped using microvascular clips under a microscope.
After 15 minutes of occlusion, the clips were removed,
and blood flow was restored.
Just after the restoration of blood flow, the head of the
mouse was fixed in a plastic frame in a sphinx position.
The right parietal bone was exposed by midline skin incision
, followed by craniectomy (diameter, 2.5 mm) with
a drill at 1 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to the bregma,
and a cranial window was made. The arachnoid mater
was not cut because the labeled platelets are readily visualized
, and intracranial pressure is well maintained without
cutting this tissue.
Blood Sampling and Platelet Preparation
We needed 15 mice for platelet donation to operated
mice. The donor mice were age and sex matched. Under
anesthesia with chloral hydrate (.3 mg/kg), 0.9 mL of
blood was collected from the carotid artery. Platelets derived
from donor mice were isolated and labeled using
10 mL of carboxyfluorescein iodoacetate succinimidyl ester
(Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described
previously.16
In each mouse, platelets (1003 106) were infused over
5 minutes using a Harvard Apparatus infusion pump, at 3
and 6 hours after reperfusion, yielding approximately
10% of the total platelet count. Platelets were allowed to
circulate for 5 minutes before recording at 3 and 6 hours.
Intravital Fluorescence Microscopy and Video Analysis
An upright microscope (SO-SM; Sankei, Tokyo, Japan)
with a mercury lamp (super high pressure mercury
lamp power supply; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was used to
continuously observe intravital cerebral microcirculation.
With a 320 objective lens, magnification on the video
screen (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) was 3200. Microscopic images
were received by a color video camera (JK-TU52 H;
Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an image intensifier.
The images were recorded on a video recorder (Sony)
equipped with a video timer (WJ-810 Time-Date Generator
; Panasonic, Tokyo, Japan). Carboxyfluorescein iodoacetate
succinimidyl ester forms the stable ester
(absorption peak, 492 nm; emission peak, 518 nm) after
reaction with intracellular esterases, so imaging required
a fluorescence filter cube (B-2A: excitation filter 450-
490 nm/barrier filter 520 nm; Nikon). Randomly selected
venular and arteriolar segments evaluated for platelet
rolling or adhesion were of 30-40 mm in diameter and of
100mm or more in length. Platelets were classified as rolling
and adherent according to the duration of immobility
on the venular wall, and rolling platelets were defined as
cells crossing the 100-mm venular segment at a velocity
that is significantly lower than the centerline velocity. Adherent
platelets were stationary for more than 2 seconds.
Rolling and adherent platelets were expressed as the
number of cells per square millimeter of vein or artery
surface, calculated from diameter and length, with the assumption
of cylindrical vessel shape, per 30 seconds.
Experimental Protocols
Mice were assigned to 3 experimental groups. The first
was sham group (n514; no ischemia and reperfusion, no
medication). The numbers of examined veins and arteries
were 14, respectively. The second was an ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) group (n517; no medication). The numbers
of examined veins and arteries were 29 and 22 at
3 hours and 31 and 18 at 6 hours, respectively. The third
was a cilostazol group (n510), receiving 30 mg/kg of cilostazol
(Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) orally at
30 minutes before ischemia (I/R1 CZ group). Numbers
of examined veins and arteries were 12 and 10 at 3 hours
and 10 and 11 at 6 hours, respectively. Platelet interactions
were recorded in 1-2 randomly selected pial veins and arteries.
Two individuals who were blinded to the treatment
groups counted the numbers of both rolling and adherent
platelets on the vascular endothelium.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical evaluation of data was performed using
PASW Statistics version 18 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Results
Figure 1shows a typical example of an actual recording
of platelet adhesion in a pial vein and pial artery. Numbers
of platelets adhering to pial veins and pial arteries were
smaller in the I/R1 CZ group than in the I/R group at
both 3 and 6 hours, respectively.Figure 2shows the number
of platelets rolling and adhering to pial veins at 3 and
6 hours, respectively. In pial veins, numbers of rolling
platelets were 2506 66/mm2/30 s and 2276 81/mm2/
30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the I/R1 CZ group compared
with 8816 180/mm2/30 s and 10016 138/mm2/30 s at
3 and 6 hours in the IR group (P,.05). Numbers of adhering
platelets were 176 6 41/mm2/30 s and 197 6 80/
mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the I/R1CZ group, respectively
, compared with 422665/mm2/30 s and 8046123/
mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the I/R group (P, .05).
Numbers of rolling and adhering platelets were significantly
reduced in the I/R1CZ group at 3 and 6 hours after
reperfusion compared with I/R group.
Figure 3 shows the number of platelets rolling and adhering
to pial arteries at 3 and 6 hours, respectively. In pial
arteries, numbers of rolling platelets were 26614/mm2/
30 s and 456 18/mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the cilostazol
group compared with 85 6 19/mm2/30 s and
1516 29/mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the I/R group
(P,.05). Numbers of adhering platelets were 286 19/
mm2/30 s and 43 6 18/mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in
the I/R1 CZ group compared with 956 15/mm2/30 s
and 155638/mm2/30 s at 3 and 6 hours in the I/R group
(P,.05). Numbers of rolling and adhering platelets were
significantly lower in the I/R 1 CZ group than in I/R
group at 3 and 6 hours after reperfusion.
Numbers of rolling and adherent platelets at 3 and
6 hours after reperfusion were significantly increased in
the I/R group compared with the sham in both venule
(P,.05) and in arteriole (P,.05). Numbers of rolling
and adhering platelets were lower in pial arteries than
in pial veins.
Discussion
The mechanisms of impaired microcirculation in brain
vessels after transient ischemia have been extensively investigated
and include swelling of endothelial cells, contraction
of vascular smooth muscle cells and/or pericytes,
and enlargement of the astrocytic foot and subsequent
narrowing of the vascular lumen.
Plugging of the small vessels has gained the most
attention. Platelets and leukocytes roll or adhere to endothelial
cells after ischemia and cause derangement of the
microcirculation. Many experiments have revealed that
inhibition of platelet or leukocyte adhesion can ameliorate
ischemic brain damage.
The present findings showed that cilostazol inhibited
rollingandadhesionofplateletsinbrainmicrovesselsafter
transient ischemia. However, the mechanisms by which
this drug inhibited these phenomena remain unclear.
The mechanisms of platelet rolling and adhesion under
conditions of ischemia and reperfusion are thought

to involve interactions between platelets and endothelial
cells because of induced expression of P-selectin or intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 by platelet activation
during ischemia. This interaction is thought to
influence brain damage during ischemia.9,12,17 NO is
related to expressions of P-selectin and ICAM-1, with increased
NO reducing the expression of P-selectin and
ICAM-1.18-21
Therelationshipsbetweencilostazol,NO,andcAMPhave
recently been clarified; cilostazol induces NO production by
endothelial NO synthase activation via a cAMP/protein kinase
A–dependent mechanism and a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Akt-dependent mechanism.22-24 Cilostazol is,
thus, thought to inhibit platelet rolling and adhesion to
endothelial cells by increasing NO levels and reducing the
expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1 in leukocytes.

A large clinical trial showed that this drug was very effective
in preventing ischemic stroke, even more effective
than aspirin, which is widely used around the world. Besides
this superiority to aspirin, one of the significant revelations
of the study was that this drug did not increase
the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. This property is particularly
interesting in the era of thrombolytic therapy. In
stroke patients after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen
activator, hemorrhage sometimes occurs and antiplatelet
drugs are, thus, usually contraindicated in the acute
stage. A drug that could inhibit platelet rolling and adhesion
without increasing the risk of hemorrhagic transformation
would certainly improve the effectiveness of
thrombolytic therapy.
The present study found that cilostazol inhibited rolling
and adhesion of platelets, and no hemorrhage was
identified from the observed vessels. Indeed, some studies
have revealed that this drug decreased hemorrhagic
transformation in murine models of ischemic stroke.25,26
This drug would, thus, appear effective for improving
deranged microcirculation in the brain vessels after
ischemia and, therefore, may prove useful for treating
stroke in the acute stage.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that cilostazol attenuates
platelet–endothelial cell interactions after transient
ischemia and reperfusion. This inhibitory effect on postischemic
platelet–endothelial cell interactions might contribute
to the neuroprotective effects of this drug.
