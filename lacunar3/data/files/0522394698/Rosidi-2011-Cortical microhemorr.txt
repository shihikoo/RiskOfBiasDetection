Abstract
Microhemorrhages are common in the aging brain, and their incidence is correlated with increased risk of
neurodegenerative disease. Past work has shown that occlusion of individual cortical microvessels as well as large-scale
hemorrhages can lead to degeneration of neurons and increased inflammation. Using two-photon excited fluorescence
microscopy in anesthetized mice, we characterized the acute and chronic dynamics of vessel bleeding, tissue compression,
blood flow change, neural degeneration, and inflammation following a microhemorrhage caused by rupturing a single
penetrating arteriole with tightly-focused femtosecond laser pulses. We quantified the extravasation of red blood cells
(RBCs) and blood plasma into the brain and determined that the bleeding was limited by clotting. The vascular bleeding
formed a RBC-filled core that compressed the surrounding parenchymal tissue, but this compression was not sufficient to
crush nearby brain capillaries, although blood flow speeds in these vessels was reduced by 20%. Imaging of cortical
dendrites revealed no degeneration of the large-scale structure of the dendritic arbor up to 14 days after the
microhemorrhage. Dendrites close to the RBC core were displaced by extravasating RBCs but began to relax back one day
after the lesion. Finally, we observed a rapid inflammatory response characterized by morphology changes in microglia/
macrophages up to 200 mm from the microhemorrhage as well as extension of cellular processes into the RBC core. This
inflammation persisted over seven days. Taken together, our data suggest that a cortical microhemorrhage does not directly
cause significant neural pathology but does trigger a sustained, local inflammatory response.

Introduction
Recent clinical evidence suggests that cortical microhemorrhages
, while not producing acute stroke symptoms, are linked to
increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia [1,2]. Traditional
animal models of hemorrhage, such as infusion of whole blood or
injection of bacterial collagenase, have provided a means to study
the physiological impact of large-scale intracerebral hemorrhages
(ICH), which affect macroscopic regions of the cortex and do
cause acute stroke [3]. However, these methods are unable to
reproduce the microhemorrhages that likely stem from the rupture
of a single small arteriole or capillary and may underlie aspects of
cognitive decline. Due in part to this lack of good animal models,
there remains an incomplete understanding of the acute and
chronic cellular dynamics and pathophysiological events following
microhemorrhage, making progress on therapeutic strategies
difficult.
There are multiple potential mechanisms, identified in previous
studies of large hemorrhages that may play a role in injuring brain
cells after microhemorrhage. Acutely, increases in intracranial
pressure and compression of brain tissue resulting from hematoma
formation can mechanically injure cells [4] and can crush
surrounding blood vessels, reducing cerebral blood flow (CBF)
and causing ischemic pathology [5]. The high concentration of
glutamate in the blood plasma that is pushed into the brain can
cause excitotoxic injury to neurons [6]. Over several days after
ICH, additional injury to brain cells can be caused by oxidative
stress and free radical damage from, for example, the byproducts
of red blood cell (RBC) lysis, as well as by edema formation [7].
Hemorrhage also drives an inflammatory cascade, leading to
microglia response and invasion of neutrophils and macrophages,
which may exacerbate injury [8].
In this paper, we studied the time course and spatial extent of
the pathological consequences of a cortical microhemorrhage in
mice. We ruptured individual, targeted arterioles in the cortex
using femtosecond laser ablation, producing microhemorrhages
[9] that are ,10,000 times smaller than those produced with
existing ICH models [10] and that match the size of the
microhemorrhages histologically observed in human brains [11].
We used two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) microscopy to
track the acute and chronic effects of these microhemorrhages
with micrometer-scale spatial resolution. We first quantified the

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
extravasation dynamics of RBCs and blood plasma after
microhemorrhage and determined that clotting limits the extent
of bleeding. We then measured tissue compression caused by the
hematoma and showed this compression was not sufficient to
collapse nearby capillaries, although blood flow speeds in these
vessels were slightly reduced. Next, we examined structural
changes in dendrite morphology, acutely and up to two weeks
after microhemorrhage, and found no evidence of large-scale
degenerative changes in the structure of the dendritic arbor. The
lack of dendrite degeneration we observed is consistent with
previous results where extravasation of blood plasma into brain
tissue at the border of an ischemic lesion did not lead to dendrite
damage over several hours [12]. Finally, we found microglia/
macrophages responded within an hour after the microhemorrhage
and increased in density near the lesion over one week. This
inflammatory reaction did not change in animals that lacked the
fractalkine chemokine receptor, CX
3
CR1, suggesting that microglia
/macrophages are activated through other signaling
pathways after a microhemorrhage. These data suggest that the
pathological impact of a microhemorrhage from a single cortical
blood vessel may be more dependent on inflammation-mediated
injury rather than on direct neuronal degeneration.
Methods
Ethics statement
All animal procedures were approved by the Cornell University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers
2006-0044 and 2009-0043) and were conducted in strict
accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National
Institutes of Health.
Transgenic animals
We used 25 adult C57BL/6 mice (,5 to 8 months of age, both
sexes, 21–32 g in mass) expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
in a subset of cortical neurons (YFP-H line; stock# 3782; The
Jackson Laboratory) [13] for experiments to characterize bleed
dynamics, tissue compression, and dendrite health after microhemorrhage.
Six adult C57BL/6 mice expressing green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in a subset of cortical neurons (GFP-M line;
stock#7788; The Jackson Laboratory) were used for experiments
tracking the health of individual dendrites after a microhemorrhage.
Data on microglia/macrophage recruitment after microhemorrhage
was generated using C57BL/6 mice heterozygous
(CX
3
CR1+/GFP (4 mice)) and homozygous (CX
3
CR1GFP/GFP
(5 mice)) for a knock-in that replaces the CX
3
CR1 fractalkine
receptor with GFP, leading to fluorescent labeling of resident
microglia cells in the brain as well as in peripheral blood
monocytes (CX
3
CR1-GFP; stock# 5582; The Jackson Laboratory
) [14]. Three additional heterozygous CX
3
CR1-GFP mice were
used to assess the microglial response from a parenchymal laser
lesion. Wild-type animals used for quantification of capillary blood
flow changes after microhemorrhage (7 mice) in histology (6 mice)
and heparin-infusion experiments (3 mice) were age-matched,
non-transgenic littermates of the YFP-H animals.
Chronic cranial imaging window preparation
To prepare a chronic cranial window for imaging [15], mice
were anesthetized using 5% isoflurane (VetOne) and maintained
at 1.5–2%. Body temperature was kept constant at 37.5uC with a
heating blanket and thermometer (50–7053P; Harvard Apparatus
). Glycopyrrolate (0.5 mg/kg mouse) (Baxter Healthcare Corp.)
was administered intramuscularly while ketoprofen (5 mg/kg
mouse) (Fort Dodge) and dexamethasone sodium phosphate
(0.2 mg/kg mouse) (American Regent, Inc.) were both administered
subcutaneously prior to surgery. A 5-mm diameter circular
bilateral craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex. An 8-
mm No. 1.5 glass cover slip (50201; World Precision Instruments)
was then placed over the exposed brain and glued to the skull
using cyanoacrylate (Loctite 495; Henkel) and dental cement (Co-
Oral-Ite Dental Mfg Co.). Animals were administered 5% (wt/vol)
glucose in physiological saline (1 ml/kg mouse) subcutaneously
and gradually transitioned off isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were
then administered ketoprofen (5 mg/kg mouse) every 24 hr for
72 hr and allowed a minimum of five days recovery before in vivo
imaging and laser-induced microhemorrhaging.
Two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy
Before imaging sessions, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
(1.5–2%) and retro-orbitally injected with 0.1-mL of 2.5% (wt/vol)
neutral (D1830; Invitrogen) or lysine-fixable (D1864; Invitrogen)
Texas-Red dextran (70 kDa) in physiological saline to fluorescently
label the blood plasma. Animals were transferred to a
custom-built two-channel 2PEF microscope with 645/65 emission
filters for Texas-Red and 517/65 filters for GFP and YFP. We
used a 1045-nm, 1-MHz, 350-fs pulse train from a Yb-fiber
oscillator/amplifier system (mJewel FCPA, IMRA America, Inc.)
as the excitation source to image dendrites and blood vessels in
YPF-H mice, while a 920-nm, 87-MHz, 100-fs pulse train from a
Ti:sapphire laser oscillator (MIRA HP; Coherent), pumped by a
continuous wave laser (Verdi-V18; Coherent), was used to image
GFP and Texas-Red. All 2PEF in vivo images were analyzed using
ImageJ (NIH), and all images were processed using a one pixel
radius median filter.
Penetrating arteriole microhemorrhage by femtosecond
laser ablation
We identified penetrating arterioles (PAs), i.e. arterioles that
branch from the surface arteriole network and dive into the brain
to feed capillary beds, as target vessels [16]. Before inducing a
microhemorrhage, 2PEF image stacks spaced 1-mm apart in the
axial direction were taken. The diameter and blood flow speed
[17] of the target PA were also measured. Microhemorrhages were
produced in the descending segment of the target PA ,20–
100 mm below the surface of the brain in most experiments, or at a
depth of ,300–500 mm for studies of the impact of a deep
microhemorrhage on dendrite degeneration. To induce a microhemorrhage
, femtosecond laser pulses were tightly focused (20X,
0.95 numerical aperture, water immersion objective; XLUMPlanFl
(Olympus)) on the outer edge of the lumen of the target PA
[9]. We used 50-fs duration laser pulses produced by a Ti:sapphire
regenerative amplifier (Legend 1 k USP; Coherent), pumped by a
Q-switched laser (Evolution 15; Coherent) and seeded by a
Ti:sapphire oscillator (Chinhook; Kapteyn-Murnane Laboratories
Inc.) that was pumped by a continuous wave laser (Verdi-V6;
Coherent, Inc). Briefly, a 10-pulse burst (1-kHz repetition rate)
with an energy of about 500 nJ/pulse was applied. If the vessel did
not rupture, the laser energy was increased by about 50%, and the
vessel was irradiated again. This process was repeated until
extravasation of RBCs and blood plasma into the parenchyma of
the brain was observed. The required laser energy to trigger a
microhemorrhage depended principally on the depth of the target
vessel beneath the brain surface and the presence of large blood
vessels on the surface of the brain above the target vessel. For each
microhemorrhage, we used the minimum laser energy required to
rupture the target vessel wall and initiate bleeding into the brain.
2PEF images of the bleeding dynamics were acquired over
Cellular Response after Cortical Microhemorrhage

,1 min after the microhemorrhage. In addition, 2PEF image
stacks of dendrites or microglia/macrophages along with the
vasculature were taken 0.5 and 1.5 hours, then one, two, and
seven (and 14, in some experiments) days after each microhemorrhage.
Characterization of RBC and plasma bleeding dynamics
2PEF movies of the bleeding dynamics after microhemorrhage
were captured at 3.34 frames/s at the axial location where
the vessel was ruptured for ,1min  with  lateral  optical
resolution of,1 mm (n = 14 microhemorrhages). During bleeding
, we measured the diameter of the growing disk of
fluorescently-labeled blood plasma, as well as the diameter of
the growing core of non-fluorescent RBCs, which appeared as
dark patches in the sea of fluorescence (.4 measurements at 
different angles at each time point). At 0.5 and 1.5 hours after
microhemorrhage, the RBC core and plasma extravasation
diameters were measured from a 20-mm maximum intensity
projection of a 2PEF image stack, centered at the axial depth of
the microhemorrhage. In some cases, we used tiled image stacks
that were later stitched together to increase the area around the
hemorrhagewecouldanalyze.
In addition, in three wild-type C57BL/6 mice we intravenously
infused heparin before and during a microhemorrhage (n = 10
microhemorrhages). Prior to microhemorrhage induction, a
jugular vein catheter was implanted and a 50-mL bolus of heparin
(100 U/kg mouse, diluted in 500 mL saline) was infused. This was
followed by a constant infusion of the heparin solution at 15-mL/
min using a syringe pump (PHD2000; Harvard Apparatus).
During the period of steady infusion, target PAs were located and
ruptured, and the bleeding dynamics quantified.
Quantification of tissue displacement after
microhemorrhage
Tocalculatethetissuedisplac ement after microhemorrhage,
2PEF images of fluorescently-labeled dendrites were analyzed
using custom-written Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc) software
that determined how far dendrites in the post-hemorrhage
image shifted laterally compared to the pre-hemorrhage image.
The 2PEF images were normalized by first subtracting
background (average of the lowest 1% of pixel values) and
then dividing by the maximum signal (average of the highest
1% of pixel values). We calculated the dendrite displacement by
finding the shift along the x- and y-axes of a 50650 pixel region
of the post-hemorrhage image that maximized the normalized
cross-correlation with the pre-hemorrhage image. To speed up
computation and avoid artifacts due to correlation with
unrelated dendrites, we considered only a 1006100 pixel
region of the pre-hemorrhage image, centered on the posthemorrhage
region. The analyzed regions of the pre and post
images were then shifted in ten pixel increments and the
algorithm repeated until the dendrite displacement from all
regions in the image was determined. Tissue displacement was
radially averaged and displayed as a function of distance from
the center of the microhemorrhage. For dendrites within about
50 mm from the edge of the microhemorrhage, the shape and
orientation of the dendrites changed too much for a crosscorrelation
based algorithm to reliably determine tissue
displacement. In this region, we manually identified the same
dendrites before and after the microhemorrhage and measured
their displacement. We verified overlap of manual and
automated measurements between 100 and 150 mm from the 
edge of the microhemorrhage.
Modeling of tissue compression by a microhemorrhage
To describe the compression of brain tissue around a
microhemorrhage, we adapted a model from Basser [18] that
describes tissue displacement during fluid infusion into the brain.
Briefly, we treated the tissue as a fluid-saturated poroelastic
network in which the pores are too small to let RBCs into the
tissue. The stress-strain relation for the fluid phase is written as
sf~{pfI ð1Þ
where sf is the stress in the fluid, pf is the pressure in the fluid
phase, andI is the unit tensor. For the solid phase, the stress-strain
relation is written as
ss~2Geszl(Tres)I ð2Þ
where ss is the stress in the solid, G and l are Lame constants
for the solid phase, and Trindicates the trace operation. The strain
tensor, es, is the symmetric part of the gradient of the displacement
vector, us, of the solid phase,

Quantification of changes in capillary perfusion and
blood flow speed
Using 2PEF image stacks of fluorescently-labeled blood plasma,
we identified individual capillary segments within 125 mm from
the target PA at baseline, then relocated these same segments
1.5 hr after inducing a microhemorrhage. In addition, we classed
these segments as flowing or stalled based on the motion of
unlabeled RBCs observed over ,3 s of image frames from the
2PEF stack. In separate animals, we quantified the RBC flow
speed in individual capillary segments before and after the
microhemorrhage by acquiring line-scan data [17]. In control
experiments, we waited the same interval that would be required
to produce a microhemorrhage, then remeasured the capillary
flow speeds.
Analysis of dendrite degeneration after
microhemorrhage
Using 2PEF image stacks in YFP-H mice taken acutely and out
to one week after microhemorrhage, we classified individual
dendrites within 150 mm of the target PA as intact or degenerated
based on the presence of dendrite blebs (i.e. circular swellings
along the dendrite path) [19]. We counted all dendrites in subregions
of 2PEF image stacks taken from the same volumes within
150 mm of the center of the microhemorrhage across all time
points in each animal (n = 24 microhemorrhages in 16 mice).
Approximately 10–40 dendrites were identified in each sub-region
and each dendrite was classed as showing evidence of degeneration
or not. Control regions were at least 1.5-mm away from the
microhemorrhage or on the contralateral side. The dendrite
exclusion diameter was determined by measuring the distance
between the closest dendrites along a line through the center of the
microhemorrage core (average of 4 measurements). In the more
sparsely-labeled GFP-M mice, we tracked individual dendrites
over multiple time points out to two weeks after the microhemorrhage
and classified the dendrites as intact, degenerated, or
missing as compared to baseline. At each imaging session, the
same dendrites were identified.
Photothrombotic stroke model
A 532-nm continuous wave laser (Compass 215 M, Coherent,
Inc.) was added to the 2PEF microscope so that the green light
was focused through the microscope objective at the imaging
plane [17]. After chronic window implantation and recovery,
animals were anesthetized, a photosensitizer dye, rose bengal
(RB) (0.03-mg/g mouse diluted at 10-mg/ml in saline), was retroorbitally
injected, and clotting was initiated by focusing,5-mW
of 532-nm laser light onto the target PA at the surface of the
brain for five minutes. Dendrite degeneration was analyzed as
described above.
Analysis of microglia/macrophage dynamics after
microhemorrhage
We manually counted the number of microglia/macrophage
cell bodies as a function of distance from the center of the
microhemorrhage using 2PEF image stacks taken acutely and
out to one week after the lesion for heterozygous and
homozygous CX
3
CR1-GFP mice. We also identified microglia
/macrophages that responded to the microhemorrhage by
analyzing the polarity of cellular processes. A cell was
determined to be responding if more than 50% of the processes
were directed, within a 30-degree cone, toward the center of the
microhemorrhage. The microglia/macrophage exclusion diameter
was measured as the distance between the closest cellular
processes along a line through the center of the microhemorrhage
core (average of four measurements per hemorrhage). The
maximum distance of microglia/macrophage response was
defined as the distance from the center of the microhemorrhage
to the farthest cell that directed the majority of its processes
towards the lesion site (average of 4–8 measurements per
hemorrhage).
Post-mortem histology
We performed histology seven days after rupturing individual
PAs in six C57BL/6 mice (n = 16 microhemorrhages located
within the first 100 mm of the brain surface). Animals were
transcardially perfused with 15 ml of phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 ml of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde
(Fisher Scientific) in PBS. The brain was extracted from
the skull and cryoprotected by immersion in 30% (wt/vol)
sucrose in PBS for 24 hr and then in 60% (wt/vol) sucrose in
PBS. To facilitate identification of individual microhemorrhages
in histological sections, fiducial marks were made at
known locations relative to the microhemorrhage sites by
insertion of a 30-gauge needle into the brain. The tissue was
frozen and cut into 25-mm thick coronal sections on a cryostat
and mounted onto microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher
Sci.).
To label RBC breakdown products and neurons, we used
Prussian blue and cresyl violet staining, respectively. Brain sections
were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, immersed in
deionized water (dH
2
O), then incubated in a 1:1 solution of 20%
hydrochloric acid and 10% potassium ferrocyanide. Sections were
rinsed with dH
2
O and incubated with cresyl violet solution (5% in
dH
2
0), then rinsed with dH
2
O, dehydrated in a graded series of
ethanol, immersed in xylene, mounted using Permount (Fisher
Scientific) and a coverslip was attached. Sections were imaged on a
white-light microscope (Axio Examiner; Zeiss).
To visualize astrocyte activation, we immunostained for glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [20]. Brain sections were rinsed in
0.5% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) before overnight incubation
with a primary mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (G3893;
Sigma) in a 1:400 dilution in PBS. Sections were then rinsed with
PBS and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a secondary
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse
IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS. Fluorescent
images were collected on a wide-field fluorescent microscope

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
(Axio Examiner; Zeiss) from sections with both primary and
secondary antibody, as well as sections containing only the
secondary antibody, using identical exposure settings. No staining
was observed in sections where the primary antibody was not
applied.
Statistical analysis
A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Data were tested for normality using a Lilliefors twosided
goodness-of-fit test. For comparisons of effect size between
groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used on data populations
that were non-parametric, while a Student’s t-test was performed
on parametric data. To compare differences in variance between
groups, the Ansari-Bradley test was used. The Pearson Product-
Moment correlation coefficient was used for statistical correlations
on all non-parametric data while an analysis of covariance was
used on all parametric data populations.
Results
We used 2PEF imaging to visualize bleeding dynamics, tissue
displacement, and blood flow changes immediately following the
microhemorrhage of single PAs in the cortex of mice, and
followed the inflammatory response and changes in dendrite
structure out to seven to fourteen days after the lesion. The
target PAs had a diameter of 19+/27 mm(mean+/2 standard
deviation) and a centerline RBC speed of 11+/26mm/s.
Microhemorrhages were produced by focusing femtosecondduration
laser pulses, 100 to 1500 nJ in energy, on the edge of
the vessel lumen of the descending segment of a PA [9].
Nonlinear absorption of laser energy ruptured the vessel wall,
which enabled RBCs and blood plasma to enter the brain
parenchyma.
Bleeding of a ruptured cortical penetrating arteriole
produced a,100-mm diameter hematoma, while blood
plasma penetrated five times farther into the brain
Immediately after the rupture of a single PA, RBCs and blood
plasma exited the lumen of the vessel and entered the brain
parenchyma (Figure 1B). The region immediately surrounding the
target PA filled with densely packed RBCs that largely excluded
the fluorescently-labeled blood plasma and thus appeared dark in
the 2PEF image. This RBC core was surrounded by a ring of
fluorescence, indicating extravasated blood plasma (Figure 1A) [9].
The diameter of the RBC core expanded to 78+/223 (mean+/2
standard deviation; 14 hemorrhages in 11 mice) within 3 s and
stabilized at 100+/231 mm after 0.5 hrs (Figure 1C). The blood
plasma entered further into the parenchyma, reaching a diameter
of 119+/250 within 3 s, continued rapid expansion over 30 s, and
stabilized at a diameter of 504+/2237 mm after 0.5 hr (Figure 1D;
13 hemorrhages in 11 mice). The bleeding time, characterized as
the time required to reach half the final diameter, was 0.66 s for
RBCs and 17 s for blood plasma. In all microhemorrhages, the
targeted vessel remained flowing, indicating that a clot obstructing
the vessel lumen did not form. In repeated imaging experiments
over one week (see below), we never observed any evidence of
repeat bleeding of the ruptured vessel.
Hematoma size was limited by clotting
To understand what limited the size of the microhemorrhage,
we intravenously administered the anticoagulant heparin and
ruptured PAs. We compared the RBC core diameter measured
30 s after microhemorrhage in animals with and without heparin
administration. We found that heparin increased the hematoma
size by 56% to 125+/2 mm compared to controls (80+/220 mm)
(Figure 2A; p,0.006; student t-test). In addition, heparin doubled
the RBC bleeding time to 1.37 s (p,0.016; Mann-Whitney U test)

(10 microhemorrhages in 3 mice). In separate experiments that did
not use heparin, we irradiated the target PA a second time after
the RBCs stopped expanding (Figure 2B) and observed that the
RBC core diameter grew, on average, by 37% after the second
irradiation (Figure 2C; p,0.001; Mann-Whitney U test) (6
microhemorrhages in 4 mice). Over the same interval, there
was, on average, no growth in the RBC core size for vessels
irradiated only once (Figure 2C) (13 microhemorrhages in 11
mice). The larger average RBC diameter with heparin and the
increase in RBC core size after a second irradiation suggested that
clotting of the vessel wall was a dominant limiting factor in
microhemorrhage size. The ,25 times longer bleeding time for
blood plasma as compared to RBCs suggests that the clot may be
initially porous, enabling blood plasma (but not RBCs) to exit the
vessel.
Microhemorrhages compressed surrounding tissue
The RBCs that extravasated into the brain after a microhemorrhage
are too large to move through the parenchyma.
Instead the RBCs compressed the tissue around the ruptured
vessel, displacing nearby dendrites (Figure 3). For most dendrites
we could trace their displacement until the RBC core stabilized
(e.g. all dendrites in Figure 3A and insets). For a small minority of
dendrites that were located immediately adjacent to the target PA,
the fluorescence rapidly decreased and we were not able to
continue to follow them (e.g. red dendrites with no corresponding
green dendrites in the second panel of Figure 3B). This decrease in
fluorescence may be due to absorption of the emitted light by the
RBCs or may represent damage to a small number of dendrites
next to the target PA by either the microhemorrhage or the
femtosecond laser irradiation used to rupture the vessel.
We analyzed the spatial extent and magnitude of the
compression of tissue surrounding a microhemorrhage by the
extravasation of RBCs. We used 2PEF images of the apical
dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons (Figure 4A) to measure the
direction and magnitude of the tissue displacement due to RBC
and plasma extravasation as a function of distance from the
microhemorrhage (Figure 4B). A maximum tissue compression of
around 20 mm was observed at the edge of the RBC core, which
decreased to a few micrometers within 50 mm from the edge of the
RBC core (Figure 4C). To group tissue compression data across
multiple lesions (10 microhemorrhages in 8 mice), we defined a
normalized distance from the center of the microhemorrhage by
dividing the distance from the center of the microhemorrhage, r,
by the RBC core radius, a
RBC
, for each microhemorrhage. Fitting
the average tissue displacement as a function of this normalized
distance to Equation (10) (Figure 4D), we found the contact stress
between the RBC core and the surrounding tissue to be 1.5 kPa,
assuming a shear modulus of brain tissue, G, of 2 kPa, and taking
the average RBC core radius to be 50 mm (Figure 4D) [18].
Microhemorrhages did not collapse nearby capillaries,
but did cause modest blood flow speed reductions
To determine if the tissue compression around the hematoma
caused nearby capillaries to collapse, potentially causing ischemia,
we identified individual capillary segments within 125 mm of the

target PA in image stacks taken before and 1.5 hr after the
microhemorrhage (Figure 5A). We classed these segments as
stalled or flowing based on the motion of RBCs within the lumen.
Of 240 capillary segments (11 micorhemorrhages in 8 mice) only
one capillary was missing and three capillaries were stalled after
the microhemorrhage (Figure 5B), indicating that microhemorrhages
did not lead to a substantial reduction in the number of
flowing capillaries in the nearby brain tissue.
In separate experiments, we measured by blood flow speed in
individual capillary segments within 125 mm of the target PA at
baseline and 1.5 hr after the microhemorrhage (Figure 5C). We
found that the median RBC flow speed decreased by 20% after a
hemorrhage, while no change was observed in control experiments
(Figure 5D; p,0.001, Mann Whitney U test) (35 (36) capillaries
across 4 (3) mice with microhemorrhages (controls)). In addition,
we find that the variance of the capillary blood flow speeds is about
five times larger after a microhemorrhage as compared to controls
(p,0.0001, Ansari-Bradley test). Despite the dramatic increase in
the variability of capillary flow speed, the decrease in average
blood flow speed is modest and so is not likely to lead to ischemic
injury to nearby brain cells.
No acute or chronic dendrite degeneration was observed
after microhemorrhage, and displaced dendrites relaxed
back over several days
To assess the impact of cortical microhemorrhages on neuronal
health, we evaluated morphological changes characteristic of
dendrite degeneration (i.e. appearance of blebs) in the apical tufts
of layer V pyramidal neurons in YFP-H mice acutely and over
seven days following a microhemorrhage produced within the top
100 mm of the cortex (16 hemorrhages in 10 mice; Figure 6).
Immediately after the microhemorrhage, we found no degeneration
in displaced dendrites surrounding the RBC-filled core
(Figures 3 and 6). As noted above, for a small number of dendrites
initially located immediately adjacent to the target vessel, we were
unable to identify the dendrites after the microhemorrhage. It is
possible that these dendrites were damaged by the laser directly or
by the expanding hematoma. No degenerative changes were
observed in the dendrites we could image over the following week.
In addition, the dendrites shifted position back into the region
occupied by RBCs immediately after the microhemorrhage,
although the arrangement of the dendrites did not necessarily
appear to be the same as before the lesion (Figure 6). Control
regions imaged in the same animals showed no degenerative
changes in dendrites (8 control regions in 7 mice; Figure 7A). We
also placed microhemorrhages near the layer V neuronal cell
bodies (300–500 mm below the cortical surface) and again saw no
degenerative changes in dendrites (4 hemorrhages in 3 mice;
Figure 7B). In contrast, photothrombotic occlusion of a single PA
[16] led to a rapid and nearly complete degeneration of nearby
dendrites that persisted to one week (4 clots in 3 mice; Figure 7C).
The dark volume with no dendrites or fluorescent debris visible at
one week suggested an ischemic infarct (Figure 7C). To quantify
these observations, we determined the fraction of visible dendrites
within 150 mm from the target PA that did not show any
degenerative changes as a function of time. We found no
differences in the number of healthy dendrites for a shallow or
deep microhemorrhage as compared to controls out to seven days,
while photothrombotic occlusion led to complete degeneration of
all dendrites within one day (Figure 8A). In addition, we found no
differences in the number of dendrites visible in each imaging
volume over one week for the control, shallow, and deep
microhemorrhage, indicating that in addition to visible dendrites

not degenerating, there was no net loss of dendrites. In contrast,
the number of visible dendrites dropped dramatically for the
photothrombotic occlusion.
The extravasated RBCs from a microhemorrhage displaced
dendrites, creating a dendrite-free region of 100+/236-mm
diameter (0.5-hr post-hemorrhage), consistent with the average
diameter of the RBC core (Figure 8B). Beginning one day after the
microhemorrhage dendrites migrated back into the region from
which they were excluded, approaching the baseline exclusion
diameter after seven days (Figures 6 and 8B).
The density of labeled dendrites in the YFP-H mice prevented
us from reliably tracking individual dendrites over time, making it
difficult to completely rule out dendrite loss. We repeated the
microhemorrhage experiments in GFP-M mice, which have much
sparser dendrite labeling, enabling tracking of individual dendrites
(Figure 9). Thirty-seven individual dendrites that were located
within 200 mm from the target PA were identified at baseline, one
hour after, then one, two, seven, and 14 days after the
microhemorrhage (Figure 9B; 2 microhemorrhages across 2 mice).
Control regions from the same animals also showed no loss of
dendrites (Figure 9C; 68 dendrites in 2 control regions across 2
mice). In four additional animals, we imaged the dendrites less
frequently and identified 99 dendrites at baseline, one hour after,
and at an additional time point 5 to 14 days after the
microhemorrhage. In total, across 136 individually tracked
dendrites 100% were observed to neither disappear nor show
degenerative changes after the microhemorrhage (95% confidence
interval of 97.8% to 100%, binomial distribution). These data
further indicated that microhemorrhages do not directly lead to
degeneration of neurons.
Microglia/macrophage density near a microhemorrhage
increased after one day and persisted beyond a week
Next, we sought to examine the inflammatory response to
cortical microhemorrhage. Both brain-resident microglia as well as
blood-borne monocytes are GFP positive in the CX
3
CR1-GFP
transgenic mouse [14]. The hemorrhage could potentially push
monocytes directly into the brain during bleeding, and later
invasion of monocytes in response to the microhemorrhage is
likely. Thus, we are unable to distinguish between microglia and
blood-derived macrophages in our analysis. 2PEF imaging of
microglia/macrophages in heterozygous and homozygous
CX
3
CR1-GFP mice (Figure 10A) revealed an increase in
microglia/macrophage density within 100 mm of the lesion
beginning at one day and persisting beyond one week
(Figure 10B; heterozygous p,0.01, homozygous p,0.05; analysis
of covariance; 5 (6) microhemorrhages in 4 (5) heterozygous
(homozygous) mice). Because we found some difficulty in
distinguishing individual cell bodies within about 25 mm from
the edge of the RBC core where the cell density was highest, the
increases in microglia/macrophage density reported here represent
a conservative estimate. Microglia/macrophage density
neither increased nor decreased at larger distances from the
microhemorrhage.

Microglia/macrophages rapidly responded to the
microhemorrhage by directing processes toward the
injury and into the RBC-filled core
We next analyzed the spatial scale and temporal dynamics of
microglia/macrophage response after microhemorrhage. We
measured the distance from the center of the hemorrhage to the
farthest responsive cell, defined as a microglia/macrophage with
more than half of its processes directed towards the site of injury.
Within 1.5 hours, cells out to 200 mm from the center of the
microhemorrhage were responsive for both heterozygous and
homozygous mice and this distance decreased over a week
(Figure 10C). In addition, we found that the fraction of
microglia/macrophages near the microhemorrhage that responded
peaked at 1.5 hours after the lesion (,75% responding) and
decreased over the following week (Figure 10D). To decouple the
microglia/macrophage response due to laser ablation from the
response due to the extravasation of blood components, we
performed parenchymal tissue ablation using a laser energy similar
to that used to induce a microhemorrhage. We found that the
furthest responsive microglia was about 90 mm from the injury (9
ablations in 3 heterozygous mouse), suggesting that the response of
microglia/macrophages after a laser-induced microhemorrhage is
dependent on bleeding into the brain parenchyma, not just the
laser ablation.
Microglia/macrophage cell bodies were displaced by extravasated
RBCs immediately after the microhemorrhage. However, in
both heterozygous and homozygous mice, microglia/macrophages
extended processes into the RBC core as early as 1.5 hours after
the microhemorrhage (Figure 10A and 10E), further indicating
rapid cellular response to the lesion.
The fractalkine receptor, CX
3
CR1, does not play a role in
microglia/macrophage activation after microhemorrhage
We did not observe significant differences in the acute
microglia/macrophage response nor in the long term increase in
microglia/macrophage density between animals that had one
functional copy of CX
3
CR1 (heterozygous) and animals where this
receptor is knocked out (homozygous). This data suggests that
other signaling pathways are responsible for microglia activation
and macrophage recruitment after a cortical microhemorrhage.
GFAP was upregulated in astrocytes seven days after
microhemorrhage but no infarction was observed
To corroborate our findings of increased inflammation with no
neuron degeneration after a microhemorrhage, we analyzed
astrocyte activation and tissue structure using post-mortem
histology. Seven days after microhemorrhage, mice were euthanized
and perfused (16 microhemorrhages in 6 mice). GFAP
immunohistology showed astrocyte activation, indicative of an
inflammatory response, in cells up to about 200 mm from the
microhemorrhage (Figure 11A). Punctate, iron deposits spanning a
diameter of,100 mm were observed using Prussian blue staining,

Discussion
We used femtosecond laser ablation to rupture targeted PAs in
mice to mimic the 100-mm sized microhemorrhages found to be
correlated with dementia and cognitive decline in humans
[11,21,22]. We then followed the dynamics of multiple cellular
constituents of the brain using chronic 2PEF imaging, allowing us
to determine the physiological consequences of a microhemorrhage
over seconds to weeks after the lesion was created.
Immediately after microhemorrhage, RBCs and blood plasma
extravasated 50 mm and 250 mm, respectively, from the ruptured
vessel into the parenchymal tissue (Figure 1). Microglia/macrophages
responded within hours up to 200 mm from the microhemorrhage
and sent cellular processes into the RBC core
(Figure 10). The tissue compression from the extravasated RBCs
displaced cortical dendrites (Figures 3 and 4) and microglia, but
did not lead to degeneration of dendritic arbors either immediately
or over the following week (Figures 6, 8, and 9). Only minor
decreases in blood flow in nearby brain capillaries were observed
(Figure 5). Over days following the microhemorrhage, cortical
dendrites returned to the region that was filled with RBCs
(Figures 6 and 8), microglia/macrophage density within 100 mmof
the lesion increased, while the number of responsive microglia/
macrophages outside this region decreased toward baseline
(Figure 10).
Microvascular bleeding is limited by clotting of the
ruptured vessel
The spatial extent of the bleeding after a microhemorrhage
could be limited by a balance between the pressure in the ruptured
vessel and the contact stress of the RBC core with the
parenchymal tissue. However, we found the contact stress between
the RBC core and surrounding tissue to be 1.5 kPa, or about
11 mmHg, well below the typical pressure of a cortical PA. On the
other hand, we found that intravascular infusion of heparin during
microhemorrhage as well as additional laser irradiation of the
target vessel after initial vessel rupture both led to an increase in
RBC core size (Figure 2), suggesting that bleeding is limited by
clotting of the vessel wall. Anticoagulant therapies, such as
warfarin, are known to increase the size of ICH in patients [23],
and in recent animal studies, we have shown that warfarin also
increases the size of microhemorrhages [24].
Tissue compression due to the RBC core does not result
in acute ischemia
Previous studies of acute blood flow changes after ICH have
found decreased CBF in the tissue around the hematoma, but it
remains unclear whether this decreased CBF leads to ischemic
infarction [25] or not [5,26,27]. For the microhemorrhages
studied here, it is unlikely that there is ischemia surrounding the
lesion. We found that nearly all brain capillaries within 75 mmof
the hematoma core remained patent and flowing after the lesion,
although the flow speed was reduced 20% in these vessels, on

average. Further, the contact stress at the RBC core/tissue border
was significantly less than the expected intraluminal pressure of
cerebral vessels (50 (25) mmHg for arterioles (venules) [28]),
suggesting that the tissue compression is not sufficient to crush
nearby blood vessels.
Microglia/macrophage response after microhemorrhage
is rapid and persists locally over days
We showed an increase in the number of responsive microglia/
macrophages within 200 mm of a microhemorrhage at 1.5 hours
after the lesion. Other investigators have observed similar
microglial responses in cells very close to an injury to the
parenchymal tissue produced by irradiation with a train of high
repetition rate, low-energy femtosecond laser pulses [29,30]. A
similar, rapid response in nearby microglia was also observed after
the laser-induced injury to a cortical blood vessel that induced very
limited bleeding [31]. The 400-mm diameter region over which
microglia/macrophages respond after the microhemorrhages
produced in this work correlates with the spatial extent of the
extravasated blood plasma, suggesting that blood plasma components
may trigger the microglia/macrophage activity.
We further observed that microglia/macrophage processes
invaded the RBC core within 1.5 hours after microhemorrhage.
Past work has shown that gradients in extracellular ATP [29] or
chemokines released from neurons [32] cause microglia to extend
processes toward focal injuries within minutes. In the case of a
microhemorrhage, blood components such as fibrin, thrombin,
RBC breakdown products, and blood plasma may induce cells to
extend processes into the RBC core [33,34].
We observed an increase in microglia/macrophage density
within 100 mm of the microhemorrhage but no decrease in density
farther from the lesion, suggesting that the increase in cell density
is not due to microglia migration but rather to proliferation of
brain-resident microglia or infiltration of blood-borne monocytes.
Consistent with this, past work has shown proliferation of resident
microglia two to three days following brain injury that leads to a
three to six fold increase in the microglia population [35]. Previous
work has also shown that blood-borne monocytes cross the bloodbrain-barrier
near the site of injury and differentiate into
macrophages after brain injury [36,37,38].
Our experiments reveal similar microglia/macrophage response
to a microhemorrhage for heterozygous and homozygous

CR1-GFP mice. Past work has shown that mice lacking

Similarly, less dendrite loss following mechanical injury was

the number of amyloid plaques [41] as well as a decrease in
neuronal loss [42] has been observed in CX

lack of the CX

We cannot, however, rule out the possibility of a different response

Despite multiple potential cell injury mechanisms, we
observed no structural degeneration of dendritic arbors
In vivo imaging or post-mortem assessment of dendrite
morphology is a sensitive assay of cell damage that has been used
to investigate the spatial scale and temporal dynamics of neuronal
injury after focal ischemia [43,44,45,46]. We found no evidence of
degeneration in the vast majority of the imaged dendrites up to
two weeks after microhemorrhage and observed a return of
dendrites to the region initially filled by RBCs beginning one day
after the microhemorrhage. No degeneration of layer II/III
dendrites was observed for microhemorrhages placed either in the
dendrite tuft or near the cell bodies (in layer V). These findings are
consistent with the observation that leakage of blood plasma into
the parenchyma in the periphery of an ischemic lesion was not
associated with dendrite degeneration [12]. Similar to previous
studies [19], our results did show dendrite blebbing following
photothrombotic occlusion of a PA. A small number of dendrites
that were located immediately adjacent to the target vessel were
observed to acutely disappear during the expansion of the
hematoma. This could be due to rapid damage to these dendrites
or, perhaps, to a loss of fluorescence signal from them due to
disruption of the imaging by the densely packed (and highly
absorbing) RBCs in the hematoma. While we cannot determine
the fate of these dendrites, for the dendrites that we were able to
visualize after the hematoma had quit expanding, many of which
were located very close to the hematoma core, we did not observe
signs of degeneration. Taken together, this data suggest that there
is very little direct damage to dendrites by a microhemorrhage,
even in the region very close to the hematoma core and in the
region where blood plasma has permeated the extracellular space.
Several mechanisms of brain cell injury following large ICH
have been identified that could play a role after microhemorrhage.
Blood components that enter the brain during bleeding, such as
thrombin and plasminogen, are potentially toxic to neurons and
other cells [47]. Neuronal injury can also result from excitotoxicity
caused by the sudden increase in extracellular glutamate
originating from the blood [6], although other work has suggested
that large increases in extracellular glutamate do not lead to
dendrite degeneration [12]. RBC lysis products are observed as
early as one day after hemorrhage and can cause cellular injury
through oxidative stress [4,48,49,50]. The lack of dendrite
pathology we observed suggests that individual microhemorrhages
are not sufficient to cause significant cellular damage through
these processes. Our experiments, however, did not examine
changes in neuronal function, which may be altered even though
structure is maintained. While our data shows that the large-scale
structure of dendritic arbors does not degenerate, it is possible that
more subtle alterations in dendrites, such as elevated rates of
dendritic spine turnover or loss, are occurring in the vicinity of the
microhemorrhage. If present, such spine loss or turnover would
effectively rewire neural circuits and could contribute to the
cognitive effects of a microhemorrhage. In addition, similar sized
microhemorrhages could lead to direct neuronal damage in other
brain regions, such as in white matter, which is more poorly
perfused than the cortical grey matter studied here. Finally, our
experiments determined the impact of microhemorrhages in
healthy adult mice. It is possible that when combined with other
disease states, such as amyloid plaque buildup and cerebral
amyloid angiopathy or hypertension, or when occurring in an
older brain microhemorrhages could cause more severe effects on
nearby neurons. Our hemorrhage induction technique does not
lead to the formation of a clot that blocks blood flow in the
targeted vessel, so there is no ischemia produced. In naturally
occurring microhemorrhages, it is possible that the clotting that
stops the bleeding may sometimes also occlude the vessel lumen.
In this case, we would expect more severe tissue damage from the
resulting decrease in local blood flow.
Conclusions
Taken together, our data show that microhemorrhages create a
perihematomal region distinguished by a local but sustained
inflammatory response, and by the absence of ischemia or
widespread dendrite degeneration. The inflammation is characterized
by acute activation and chronic increase in microglia/
macrophages, as well as activation of astrocytes. The spatial extent
of this perihematomal region is coincident with the initial distance
blood plasma pushes into the brain parenchyma, suggesting that
acute exposure to blood plasma components may initiate the
inflammatory process. This inflammation, in turn, may be a long-

term driver of neural dysfunction or death that underlies the
cognitive decline linked to the accumulation of microhemorrhages.
For example, inflammation has been shown to affect dendrite
spine turnover in animal models of ischemia [51] and after mild
brain injury [15,52]. However, our work also shows that occlusion
of individual microvessels leads to more severe neuropathology
than bleeding from these vessels. Thus the cost of small vessel
bleeds appears to be smaller than the cost of such vessels becoming
occluded, suggesting that patients with elevated cardiovascular risk
factors, such as hypertension, would potentially benefit from
therapeutic strategies that prevent small vessel occlusions, even if
at the expense of small vessel bleeds.
