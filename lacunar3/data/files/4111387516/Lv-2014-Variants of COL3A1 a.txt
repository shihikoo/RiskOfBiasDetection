Abstract Type III collagen plays an important role in activating
platelets, forming thrombus, and maintaining the mechanical
properties of arteries. This study aimed to test the hypothesis
that genetic variants of COL3A1 (gene encoding type III
collagen) contribute to recurrence and prognosis of stroke. We
investigated the associations of three variants (rs2138533,
rs11887092, and rs1800255) in theCOL3A1gene with stroke
recurrence and prognosis in 1,544 patients with three subtypes
of stroke: lacunar infarction (n=442), atherothrombotic infarction
(n=670), and hemorrhage (n=432). These associations
were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox
regression models. Patients were followed up for 4.5 years.
The A allele of rs1800255 in theCOL3A1gene coding region
was significantly associated with a reduced risk of stroke
recurrence in patients with lacunar infarction (adjusted hazard
ratio [HR] 0.58, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.93,P=
0.024), but there was an increased risk of all-cause mortality
of atherothrombotic patients (adjusted HR 1.43, 95 % CI
1.01–2.00,P=0.044). The TT genotype of rs2138533 showed
a significantly increased risk of death caused by cardiovascular
disease or stroke in lacunar infarct patients (adjusted HR
2.98, 95 % CI 1.27–6.98, P=0.012), but there was a reduced
risk of all-cause mortality for patients with intracerebral
hemorrhage (adjusted HR 0.34, 95 % CI 0.12–0.93,
P=0.036). The G allele of rs11887092 increased the risk of
stroke recurrence in patients with atherothrombotic stroke
(adjusted HR 1.59, 95 % CI 1.04–2.44,P=0.035). In conclusion
, variants ofCOL3A1 might play a vital role in determining
the risk of recurrence and prognosis after stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and
in China. Stroke survivors are often disabled, require longterm
care, and are at high risk of recurrence (Tunstall-Pedoe
et al. 1994). Stroke recurrence is common among stroke
survivors and results in cumulative disability and cognitive
dysfunction (Kiyohara et al. 2003). The important role of
genetic variants in the pathophysiology of stroke is being
increasingly recognized. Therefore, the effect of genetic factors
in recurrence of stroke needs to be investigated. Knowledge
of the mechanisms of recurrence and prognosis in each
subtype of stroke and management of risk factors play a vital
role in the secondary prevention of stroke.
The recurrence of ischemic stroke is common; over 20 % of
patients have a recurrent stroke within 5 years. Intracranial
atherosclerosis is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence
and vascular death (Conforto et al. 2013). Strong evidence
indicates that antiplatelet therapy is critical to secondary
prevention of ischemic stroke (King et al. 2011). As a major
component of thrombosis, platelets play an important role in
development of atherosclerosis (Huo et al. 2003). Activation
of platelets by exposed collagen after vessel wall injury is a
primary event in the pathogenesis of stroke and myocardial

infarction (Chen and Kahn2003). Early during atherogenesis,
collagen fibers are the only matrix protein, which supports
adherence and trapping of platelets to exposed
subendothelium at sites of the damaged vessel wall (Sixma
et al. 1997). After development of atherosclerotic lesions,
platelets are activated by the formed plaque exposed by plaque
rupture. Recently, collagen types I and III were identified in
human atherosclerotic plaques, which induce platelet adhesion
, aggregation, and thrombus formation through the platelet
collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (Penz et al. 2005). This
suggests that glycoprotein VI mainly binds to type III collagen
present in the core region of plaques (Schulz et al. 2008). A
previous study showed that pretreatment of plaques with
collagenase or anti-collagen I and anti-collagen III antibodies
could not promote plaque-induced platelet activation (Penz
et al.2005). These results indicate that collagenous structures,
especially type III collagen of plaques, initiate platelet
activation.
Low blood pressure reduces the recurrence of stroke and
the incidence of cardiovascular events in Chinese patients
with cerebrovascular diseases (Liu et al.2009). A multicenter
study showed that control of blood pressure to less than
130 mmHg significantly reduces the rate of intracerebral
hemorrhage (Benavente et al. 2013). Moreover, the authors
of this multicenter study recommended that less than
130 mmHg was also beneficial to patients with recent lacunar
stroke. However, control of hypertension cannot explain the
recurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients whose
blood pressure is effectively controlled. There may be genetic
susceptibility in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. The
vessel wall, which consists of endothelial cells, vascular
smooth muscle cells, and the extracellular matrix, is sensitive
to various stimuli (Kong et al. 2013). Collagen is the main
determinant of arterial sensitivity to rupture (Dobrin et al.
1984). Type III collagen is the second most abundant collagen
in blood vessels, except for type I collagen. Mutations of the
COL3A1 gene are known to cause Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
type IV, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by
vascular abnormalities, consisting of rupture and stroke
(Leistritz et al. 2011). Several studies have demonstrated that
variants of COL3A1 contribute to the susceptibility of familial
intracranial aneurysms and sporadic intracranial aneurysms.
Angiotensin II promotes thoracic aortic dissection and rupture
in COL3A1 haploinsufficient mice (Faugeroux et al.2013). In
Caucasian patients from Ireland, COL3A1 variants are associated
with the risk of coronary artery disease and the recurrence
of coronary events (Muckian et al. 2002). These findings
are consistent with the contribution of collagen to mechanical
properties of the vessel wall and the predominance of
type III collagen, although there are differences between intracranial
arteries and extracranial arteries.
These results suggest that type III collagen is the major
collagen involved in platelet activation, and it is also crucial
for the mechanical properties of arteries. Therefore, we conducted
a prospective study to test the hypothesis that variants
of theCOL3A1gene contribute to the risk of stroke recurrence
and prognosis.
Materials and Methods
Stroke Population
This project was approved by the local ethic committees of
collaborating hospitals. All of the participants reported themselves
to be Han nationals and provided written informed
consent.
This was a multicenter hospital-based stroke registry. Between
November 2000 and November 2001, a total of 2,000
consecutive first-ever stroke patients aged 35–74 years were
recruited from seven clinical centers (Yanzhou, Xi’an, Chongqing
, Wu-han Xiehe, Wuhan Tongji, Beijing, and Tianjin)
(Chen et al. 2010). To minimize phenotypic heterogeneity,
we recruited only patients who had one of the following three
subtypes of stroke: cerebral thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage
, and lacunar infarction. Briefly, the diagnosis of stroke
was based on a strict neurological examination by computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or
both, according to the International Classification of Diseases
(9th Revision). The diagnosis of three stroke subtypes was
based on clinical presentation and cerebral imaging. We excluded
patients who had a transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, brain tumors, embolic brain infarction, or
cerebrovascular malformation or autoimmune diseases. We
also excluded patients with severe systemic diseases (e.g.,
collagenosis, inflammation, liver, neoplastic and renal diseases
, and endocrine and metabolic diseases) but not diabetes
mellitus.
Follow-Up and Outcome Assessment
To assess whether genetic variants of the COL3A1 gene contribute
to the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis after the
first-ever stroke, the cohort was prospectively followed up
over a median of 4.5 years until 2006 by a standard questionnaire
and telephone interview by the investigators. The end
points included stroke recurrence, death caused by cardiovascular
disease or stroke (Csdeath), and all-cause death. The
definition of recurrent stroke has been described previously
(Chen et al.2010). Deaths were reported by family members.
During a median of 4.5 years (range, 0.1–6.0 years) of followup
, 74 patients were lost because of emigration. No significant
differences in the frequency of genotypes and clinical characteristics
of patients were found between those who were
followed up and those who were lost to follow-up (Chen
et al. 2010). Those patients who had no events and were

unable to be followed up completely were included in the
event-free group.
Determination of Biochemical Variables and Collection
of Clinical Data
Blood samples were collected after a 12-h overnight fast. In
patients with acute medical events, blood collection was delayed
for at least 6 weeks. The plasma was separated by
centrifugation and white cell buffy coat was kept at −70 °C.
Biochemical variables, including blood glucose, total plasma
cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, were determined using an
automatic analyzer (Hitachi 7060, Tokyo, Japan) within
3 months of the first episode of stroke. All measurements
were determined at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
at Fuwai Hospital.
Selecting and Genotyping Variants of COL3A1
For the analysis of gene polymorphisms, genomic DNA was
extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes as described previously
(Miller et al. 1988). The target variants of COL3A1
were selected as previously described (Chen et al.2012). The
two tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2138533
and rs11887092 are located in the promoter region of
COL3A1. The variant rs1800255 is located in the coding
region, resulting in an amino acid substitution, Ala to Thr, at
698. Testing of thermal stability of this mutant collagen peptide
has been described previously (Chen et al. 2012). Therefore
, all three tag SNPs were genotyped as previously described
(Chen et al. 2012). A total of 1,544 subjects were
genotyped for these variants. We confirmed some genotyping
results by direct sequencing of the products with a DNA
sequencer (ABI Prism 377; Perkin Elmer, USA).
Luciferase Reporter Assays
To study whether the risk-associated allele of COL3A1 has
functional relevance, the effects of the variant rs2138533 on
expression of COL3A1 were assessed as follows: COL3A1
promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA; see supplemental material),
which carried either the wild-type or variant sequences of
rs2138533. The reporter containing rs2138533T was defined
as pGL3/533T and that containing rs2138533C as
pGL3/533C. The promoter sequences were confirmed by
sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were cultured and transfected with
1.5μg of the respective reporter plasmid and 50 ng of Renilla
luciferase vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation
, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 48 h, cells were collected
and luciferase activity was determined by using the dualluciferase
reporter assay system (Promega) with a
luminometer (Sirius; Pforzheim, Germany). Firefly luciferase
expression levels were adjusted based on Renilla luciferase
activity in controls.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional
hazards models to describe the association between
genotypes and the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis.
These analyses were performed after adjustment for confounding
factors, including age, sex, body mass index, hypertension
, HDL-C levels, TC levels, TG levels, diabetes
mellitus, smoking status, and alcohol intake.
All P values are two-sided, and P<0.05 was considered
significant. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS
software, version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Clinical Characteristics
The baseline clinical data of the patients are shown in supplement
Table S1. In this study, a total of 2,000 patients with firstever
stroke, with 1,260 men and 740 women aged 60.4±
9.5 years (mean±SD), were recruited. Finally, 1,544 patients
(60.1±9.4 years; men, 63.3 %) were available for assessment
of genetic association analysis. A total of 24 patients with
indefinite diagnosis, 127 with insufficient DNA samples, and
305 who failed to have detection ofCOL3A1 genotypes were
excluded. Among the 1,544 patients, 670 patients were diagnosed
with thrombosis, 442 with lacunar infarction, and 432
with hemorrhage. After a median of 4.5 years (range, 0.1–
6.0 years) of follow-up for 1,544 patients with stroke, a total of
299 recurrent strokes were recorded.
Variants of the COL3A1 Gene Are Associated with a Risk
of Stroke Recurrence and Prognosis
The genotype frequencies for these three variants conformed
to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in each group. Among
patients with lacunar infraction, the A allele of rs1800255 was
significantly associated with a reduced risk of stroke recurrence
(P=0.037, Fig. 1a). After adjustment for age, sex,
hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, and glucose, TG, and TC levels, we still
found that the patients carrying the A allele of rs1800255
conferred a reduced risk of stroke recurrence (adjusted hazard
ratio [HR], 0.58; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.36–0.93;
P=0.024) (Table 1). However, among atherothrombotic
stroke patients, the A allele of rs1800255 significantly increased
the risk of all-cause death (P=0.041, Fig. 1b). After
adjustment for the above-mentioned multiple confounding
198 J Mol Neurosci (2014) 53:196–203
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1173331532)
factors, there was still an increased risk of all-cause death
(adjusted HR, 1.43; 95 % CI, 1.01–2.00;P=0.044)(Table2).
These results suggest that the A allele of rs1800255 is a risk
factor for all-cause mortality of atherothrombotic patients, but
is a protective factor for lacunar stroke recurrence. Among
patients with lacunar infraction, the TT genotype of
rs2138533 had a significantly increased risk of Csdeath
(P=0.001, Fig. 2a). After adjustment for the abovementioned
multiple confounding factors, patients with the
TT genotype of rs2138533 still had an increased risk of
Csdeath (adjusted HR, 2.98; 95 % CI, 1.27–6.98; P=0.012)
(Table 2). However, among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
, the TT genotype of rs2138533 had a significantly
reduced risk of all-cause death (P=0.012, Fig. 2b). After
adjustment for the above-mentioned multiple confounding
factors, patients with the TT genotype of rs2138533 still had
a reduced risk of all-cause death (adjusted HR, 0.34; 95 % CI,
0.12–0.93;P=0.036)(Table2). These results suggest that the
homozygous TT genotype of rs2138533 is a risk factor for
cardiovascular death of lacunar stroke patients, but is a protective
factor against cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality
of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Among patients
with atherothrombotic stroke, the G allele of
rs11887092 was significantly associated with an increased
risk of stroke recurrence (P=0.043, Fig. 3). After adjustment
for the above-mentioned multiple confounding factors, we
still found that the patients carrying the G allele of
rs11887092 conferred an increased risk of stroke recurrence
(adjusted HR, 1.59; 95 % CI, 1.04–2.44;P=0.035)(Table1).
These results suggest that the G allele of rs11887092 is a risk
factor for recurrence in patients with atherothrombotic stroke.
Overall, these results suggest that the three variants of the
COL3A1 gene play different roles in determining the risk for
recurrence and prognosis after stroke. The relative risks of three
end point events (stroke recurrence, Csdeath, all-cause death)
in subtype of stroke according to genotypes of the three variants

C Allele of rs2138533 Increases COL3A1 Transcriptional
Activity
We used the dual-luciferase reporter system to determine the
effect of the variant rs2138533 on COL3A1 promoter transcriptional
activity. We generated two reporter constructs for
the T or C allele (pGL3-533T and pGL3-533C, respectively)
and transfected the constructs into NIH3T3 cells. The promoter
carrying the C allele of rs2138533 had 2.10-fold higher
transcriptional activity than that carrying the T allele (47.24±
6.76 vs. 23.63±2.95, P=0.005; Fig. 4).
Discussion
The present study is the first large-scale prospective investigation
of the associations between the variants of COL3A1 with
the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis in the Chinese
population. We found that three variants (rs1800255,
rs11887092, and rs2138533) in the COL3A1 gene were associated
with the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis. Furthermore
, this association was independent of conventional risk

factors, indicating that genetic variants of the COL3A1 gene
may serve as predictors for stroke recurrence and prognosis.
Collagen represents up to 40 % of the total protein of the
vessel wall and has important regulatory functions within the
vasculature (Farndale et al. 2004). Fibrillar types I and III collagen
compose the majority of total collagen in the vasculature,
and changes in their content and/or composition may contribute
to the development of arterial stiffening (Tanaka et al. 1986;
Dingemans et al. 2000; Fatema et al. 2004). Increased collagen
cross-linking increases vascular and myocardial stiffness,
leading to elevated systolic and pulse pressure (Susic, 2007).
Uncontrolled collagen accumulation leads to arterial stenosis,
while excessive collagen breakdown combined with insufficient
synthesis weakens fibrous caps of plaques, making them prone
to rupture (Rekhter, 1999). Therefore, collagen is in a dynamic
balance between degradation and synthesis.
Cerebral small-vessel diseases underlie 20 to 30 % of ischemic
strokes and a larger proportion of intracerebral hemorrhage
(Gould et al. 2006). Lacunar stroke, involving small, deep
ischemic lesions ranging from2to15mmindiameterresulting
from occlusion of arteries, comprises approximately 25 % of
ischemic strokes in Western countries (Bamford et al. 1987;
Norrving 2003). A hospital-based study in a Chinese population
found that the proportion of lacunar infarction in China is
much higher than that in Western countries (Wu et al. 2010).
Prospective studies have reported that the rate of recurrence in
those with lacunar infarction is 4–11 % every year (Norrving
2003; Benavente et al. 2005). Lacunar infarction is commonly
considered as a benign vascular event because of no acute
mortality, a generally excellent recovery, and a low risk of
stroke recurrence. However, recent studies have reported that
this is only in the early stage of lacunar infarction (Norrving
2003; Jackson and Sudlow2005; Sacco et al.2006). In the long
term, there is a higher risk of death, continual occurrence of
recurrent stroke, and development of cognitive dysfunction
from lacunar infarction (Arboix et al. 2007). Increasing evidence
has shown that hypertension, a history of lacunar infarction
, and diabetes mellitus are recognized as independent risk
factors for recurrence of lacunar infarction (Jackson and
Sudlow2005; Arboix et al.2007;Hartetal.2013). The reason
for recurrence of lacunar infarction is tightly associated with the
pathophysiological mechanism of lacunar stroke. Initially,
lipohyalinosis was thought to be the main small-vessel pathology
of arterial occlusion (or stenosis), but microatheroma is
now thought to be the most common mechanism. Interestingly,
a follow-up study indicated that large-artery atherosclerosis
may be important in the development of small-artery disease.
In patients with small-artery disease, intracranial stenosis is
often found at the time of recurrence.
Type III collagen (encoded by COL3A1) has been identified
in the thickened intima of atherosclerotic lesions
(Pickering et al. 1996). A previous study provided evidence
that type III collagen is decreased in patients with myocardial
infarction (Kong et al. 2013). In our study, the T allele of
rs2138533 reducedCOL3A1transcriptional activity and led to
decreased type III collagen production. Therefore, the TT
genotype confers a high risk of Csdeath owing to a reduced
content of type III collagen, which weakens plaque stability.
This results in plaque rupture and reocclusion of small vessels.
The variant rs1800255 of COL3A1 results in a G (wide-type
allele) to A (risk allele) change and leads to amino acid
substitution, which results in lower thermal stability (Chen
et al. 2012). This indicates that type III collagen of A allele

Fig. 4 Effect of the variant rs2138533 onCOL3A1transcriptional activity.
Dual-luciferase assays were performed to determine the effect of the
variant rs2138533T/C on COL3A1 promoter activity. We generated two
constructs of promoter-reporter for either the T or C allele (pGL3-533T
and pGL3-533C, respectively) and transfected the constructs into
NIH3T3 cells. The variant rs2138533 C resulted in 2.10-fold higher
transcriptional activity than its corresponding variant rs2138533T
(rs2138533 C, 47.24±6.76 versus variant rs2138533 T, 23.63±2.95,
P=0.005)

carriers has a lower thermal stability. This possibility may
explain why the A allele of rs1800255 is a risk factor for allcause
mortality of atherothrombotic patients. However, interestingly
, the A allele of rs1800255 is a prospective factor for
lacunar stroke recurrence. We found that the G allele of
rs11887902 increased the risk for atherothrombotic stroke recurrence.
The mechanisms of the A allele of rs1800255 reducing
the risk of lacunar stroke recurrence and the G allele of
rs11887902 increasing the risk for atherothrombotic stroke
recurrence remain unclear and require further study. Regardless,
these results strongly indicate that atherothrombotic stroke and
lacunar stroke have different pathophysiological mechanisms.
Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiological
mechanism of lacunar infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage
(Nakase et al. 2008; Illanes et al. 2011). A previous study
found that higher serum N-terminal propeptide of type III
procollagen levels are independently associated with a stiffer
aorta in dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Another study demonstrated
that sustained inflammation may stimulate a reparative
process, increasing early type III collagen synthesis
(Purushothaman et al. 2011). Based on the functions of type
III collagen, we suggest that the reduced content of type III
collagen alleviates arterial stiffness for those patients with
first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage. This possibility could explain
why the TT genotype of rs2138533 is a protective factor
against all-cause mortality of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.
However, the fact that the TT genotype of rs2138533
was not associated with the recurrence and prognosis of
atherothrombotic stroke may be due to a different pathogenesis
between large-artery diseases and small-artery diseases.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that variants of
COL3A1contribute to the risk of stroke recurrence and prognosis
in a Chinese population. This study shows the important
role of variants of an extracellular matrix gene in determining
the risk of recurrence and prognosis after stroke. These findings
may help to improve secondary prevention or therapeutic
strategies for stroke patients.
