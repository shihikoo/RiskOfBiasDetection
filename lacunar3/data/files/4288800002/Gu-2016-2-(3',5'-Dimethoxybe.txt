Abstract—2-(30,50-Dimethoxybenzylidene) cyclopentanone
(DMBC) is a novel small-molecule compound synthesized
by our group. Here, we found that in rat models of permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), intraperitoneal
injection (ip) of DMBC at 1 h after ischemia reduced
infarct volume, improved neurological deficits and
increased the protein levels of microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP 2) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in the
ischemic cortex. Post-treatment of DMBC still produced
neuroprotective effects even when administered at 6 h after
ischemia. In the oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced
astrocytes or HT22 cell injury, DMBC treatment decreased
the OGD-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage
and increased the GFAP levels in astrocytes. In addition,
Annexin-V-Fluos staining analysis revealed that DMBC treatment
attenuated both OGD-induced apoptosis and necrosis
in astrocytes. Western blotting analysis showed DMBC
treatment inhibited the ischemia or OGD-induced increases
in active cathepsin B in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes
or HT22 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated
that DMBC treatment blocked the ischemia or
OGD-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes
into the cytoplasm in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes
or HT22 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that
DMBC can offer neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemia with an extended therapeutic window and its
mechanism might be associated with inhibition of the
cathepsin B activation. 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

INTRODUCTION
Currently, the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the
only thrombolytic agent approved for acute ischemic
stroke by the United States Food and Drug
Administration. However, only a small proportion of
patients received the thrombolytic treatment mainly
because of its narrow therapeutic time window (Zaleska
et al., 2009). Therefore, recent studies have focused on
the prevention of brain damage secondary to ischemia
(Sun et al., 2013). One of the underlying strategies for
the development of such therapeutics is to inhibit mechanisms
that mediate mitochondrial membrane destabilization
via targeting the prodeath signaling upstream of
the mitochondrial damage. Activation of lysosomal pathway
can induce neural cell death via cathepsinsmediated
mitochondrial damage (Xu and Zhang, 2011;
Xu et al., 2014).
Lysosome contains a large number of acidic
hydrolases, and serves as the crucial site of degradation
of constituent cell proteins and amino acid recycling.
Cathepsins are one of the representative lysosomal
hydrolases groups. Based on the amino acid of the
active site that confers catalytic activity, cathepsins are
classified into three subgroups: cysteine (cathepsins B,
C, F, H, K, L, N, O, S, T, U, W and X), aspartyl
(cathepsins D and E) and serine (cathepsins A and G)
cathepsins. In both neurons and astrocytes, cathepsins
B, L and/or D are abundant (Yamashima and Oikawa,
2009; Xu et al., 2014). Growing evidence in the past
decade has shown that lysosomes may function as death
signal integrators in both necrosis (Yamashima, 2000)

and apoptosis (Nylandsted et al., 2004). It is nowadays
widely accepted that the magnitude of the lysosomal rupture
and consequently, the amount of hydrolytic enzymes
released into the cytosol may influence the cell death fate:
apoptosis or necrosis (Brunk and Svensson, 1999;
Olejnicka et al., 1999; Kessel and Poretz, 2000; Li et al.,
2000; Bursch, 2001; Boya et al., 2003; Pivtoraiko et al.,
2009). Partial lysosomal rupture induces apoptosis by
mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. In contrast,
intense lysosomal rupture leads to necrosis (Terman
et al., 2006a,b). A clear delineation of causal connections
between cysteine cathepsin activation such as cathepsin
B and L and neuronal cell death has been strongly suggested
in animal models of both global and focal cerebral
ischemia, and inhibition of cathepsins confers the neuroprotective
effects against cerebral ischemia (Nitatori
et al., 1995; Kohda et al., 1996; Seyfried et al., 1997;
Yamashima et al., 1998; Durmaz et al., 2008; Windelborn
and Lipton, 2008; Wen et al., 2008; Chaitanya and Babu,
2009; Hou et al., 2010; Ozden et al., 2011; Xu et al.,
2014). Therefore, cathepsins might become a promising
target for drugs to treat ischemic stroke.
Some novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
such as darbufelone and S-2474, in which the
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl (DTBHP) moiety that
can act as antioxidant, is linked through a vinyl bridge to
a heterocyclic ring, showing a dual activity against
cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
(Fig. 1)(Yagami et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2010). S-2474 rescues
cortical neurons from human group IIA secretory
phospholipase A(2)-induced apoptosis (Yagami et al.,
2005). Resveratrol, 5-[(1E)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]-
1,3-benzenediol (Fig. 1) has anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory
effects, and shows neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia via modulating mitochondrial
dysfunctions (Yousuf et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2010;
Orsu et al., 2013). Therefore, our group designed and
synthesized a new hybrid compound a-(3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene
) cyclopentanone (DMBC), in which the
3,5-dimethoxyphenyl ring replaces the DTBHP moiety
and cyclopentanone replaces the heterocyclic ring moiety
of DTBHP class compounds (Fig. 1). In addition, more
recently, using pain models of the mouse acetic acid
and hot-plate, we firstly reported that DMBC has analgesic
activity associated with autophagy and cathepsin
L ( Gu et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized that
DMBC might have neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemia and its effects might be associated with
inhibition of the cathepsins activation.
In the current study, in a rat focal ischemic stroke
model and an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-
mediated astrocyte or HT22 cell injury, we observed the
neuroprotective effects of DMBC and its mechanisms
involving the activation of cathepsin B and its release
from the lysosome to the cytoplasm.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Sprague–Dawley (S–D) rats weighing 280–310 g (SLAC
Company, Shanghai, China) were used. For primary
cortical astrocytes culture, pregnant SD rats with
embryonic fetuses were applied. All animal procedures
were approved by the University Committee on Animal
Care of Soochow University and conformed to the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of
animals used, and use alternatives to in vivo
techniques, if available. 2-(3’,5’-Dimethoxybenzylidene)
cyclopentanone (DMBC) was synthesized by our group
in the College of Pharmaceutical Science, Soochow
University (Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). For rat
experiments, DMBC 1, 5, 25 mg/kg (dissolved in 0.5%
carboxymethyl cellulose sodium) or vehicle (0.5%
carboxymethycellulose sodium) was administered
intraperitoneally (ip) at 1 h or 6 h after the onset of
pMCAO. Sham-operated or ischemic control animals
received ip injection of vehicle.
Permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
(pMCAO)
Procedures for rats’ pMCAO were performed as
described previously (Xu et al., 2012). Briefly, male rats
were anesthetized with 4% choral hydrate (350 mg/kg)
administered intraperitoneally. A 4-0 monofilament nylon
suture rounded at its tip by heating was inserted into the
right internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of the
right middle cerebral artery. The suture was left in place
until the rat was sacrificed. Body temperature was maintained
in the range of 37.0 ± 0.5C with a thermostatically
controlled heating pad (Institute of Biomedical
Engineering, CAMS, BME-412A ANIMAL REGULATOR,
308005669) during and after the surgery until the rat
recovered from the anesthesia. Sham-operated rats
received the same procedures except for cutting a small
incision and inserting a suture to the artery. For determination
of the infarct size, animals were euthanized, and
the brains were removed and sectioned at 3-mm intervals
in a plastic module (Harvard Apparatus). The coronal
brain slices were stained with 4% 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). The infarct volume
was analyzed using ImageJ 1.42q and calculated as the
ratio of the infarction area and the total right hemisphere.
Behavioral measures
Behavioral tests were performed before pMCAO and at
24 h after pMCAO. The following three tests had been
used to evaluate the behavioral outcomes.
Neurological deficit scores. The neurological deficits
were scored on a five-point scale described in the
previous study (Longa et al., 1989): 0, no detectable neurological
deficit; 1, failure to extend contralateral forepaw
fully (mild focal neurologic deficits); 2, circling to the contralateral
side (moderate focal neurologic deficits); 3, falling
to the contralateral side at rest (severe focal deficits);
4, no spontaneous motor activity and a depressed level of
consciousness (very severe neurologic deficits).

Grip strength test. Forelimb grip strength was
assessed using a rat grip strength meter (YLS-13A,
Jinan YiYan Technology Development Company
Limited, China). The Rats’ tails were held until they
grasped the pull-bar with both forepaws. The peak force
was recorded as the maximum grip strength (strength in
grams). The data were averaged from 10 tests for each
animal (Xu et al., 2014).
Cylinder test (Forelimb asymmetry test). Rats were
placed into a plexiglass cylinder (HOOFAN, Wenling,
Zhejiang, China), and the number of contacts by both
forelimbs and by either impaired or non-impaired
forelimbs of the rat was analyzed during the rat’s
vertical movements along the wall of the cylinder.
A total of 20 movements were recorded during the
10-min test. The final cylinder score was calculated
as: (non-impaired forelimb movementimpaired
forelimb movement)/(non-impaired forelimb movement +
impaired forelimb movement + both movement), as
previously described for the rat (Schallert et al., 2000;
Xu et al., 2014).
Measurement of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
The relative cerebral cortical blood flow in rats was
continuously measured using Laser–Doppler Flowmetry
(moorVMS-LDF2, Moor Instruments Inc., England). The
LDF small caliber probe was placed on the surface of
skull with glue, 15 mm posterior to the bregma and
15 mm lateral to the right side of the bregma. The
baseline value was obtained from the mean value
measured continuously for 30 min before pMCAO.
Quantitative analysis for rCBF was performed from
three rats in each group of Sham, pMCAO and pMCAO
+ DMBC, respectively. The data are normalized to the
baseline value of each group. rCBF is expressed as the
percentage of the baseline.
Cell culture, OGD procedures and cell death
determination
Primary cortical astrocyte cultures from day 1 or 2
Sprague–Dawley rat pups were performed as previously
described (Qin et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014). Briefly, brain
cortices were isolated, dissociated mechanically and
digested with trypsin/DNAse treatment, and then filtered
through a sterile 40lm Nitex mesh. Cells were suspended
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM)/F12 (1:1) (GIBCO, 11,330) containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, 10,099),
100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL streptomycin, seeded
on polystyrene culture plates coated with poly-L-lysine,
and incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
2
at 37C. More than 95% of the cultured cells are positive
for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acid protein
(GFAP).
The HT22 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Xingshun
Xu (Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China) (Yu
et al., 2012), which are the subclone of HT4 derived from
the mouse hippocampus. The HT22 cells were maintained
in DMEM (GIBCO, 11,330), supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, 10,099),
100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL streptomycin.
For oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment,
cultured cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH7.4), and then refreshed with DMEM
without glucose (GIBCO, 11,966). Cells were placed in
a hypoxic incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, San
Diego, CA, USA) equilibrated with 95% N
2
/5% CO
2
at
37C for the indicated time. Control cells (non-OGD
cells) were incubated in DMEM/F12 solution in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
2
at 37C, running
for the same periods corresponding with the
experimental groups (Qin et al., 2010). The indicated concentrations
of DMBC or vehicle were added to the cells at
the time of OGD induction. The amount of DMSO added
during our cell culture experiments never exceeded
0.1%. Cells were harvested at 12 h post-OGD and then
the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from HT22
cells or astrocytes was detected using an LDH assay kit
(Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing,
China, A020) (Antonelli et al., 2008; He et al., 2008; Du
et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2014).
Detection of apoptosis and necrosis
The Annexin-V-Fluos staining kit (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to determine cells
undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. Astrocytes were
seeded in a 24-well plate. DMBC 0.1, 1, 10lM or 
vehicle was administered at the onset of OGD, and
apoptotic and necrotic cells were analyzed at 12 h after
OGD. Instructions of the manufacturer were followed for
staining cells, and then cells were analyzed with a
fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX51, Olympus Co,
Japan). Cells that were propidium iodide (PI) negative
and Annexin V negative were considered as healthy;
cells that were PI negative and Annexin V positive were

Western blotting assay
Theproteinsfrombraincortex,culturedastrocytesorHT22

to the nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with
antibody against microtubule-associated protein2 (MAP2
,
monoclonal, Sigma, M9942, 1:250), glial fibrillary acid
protein (GFAP, monoclonal, Millipore, MAB360; 1:1000),
or cathepsin B (polyclonal, Millipore, 06-480, 1:250) in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST)
and 5% nonfat dry milk at 4C overnight. Membranes
were then washed and incubated with DyLightTM 680-
Labeled second antibody (KPL, mouse IgG (H + L), 042-
06-18-06, 1:10,000; rabbit IgG (H + L), 042-06-15-06,
1:10,000) in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h.
Immunoreactivity was detected with Odyssey scanner
(LI-COR). The signal intensity of the primary antibody
binding was quantitatively analyzed with Sigma Scan Pro
5, and was normalized to a loading control b-actin
(monoclonal, Sigma, A5441, 1:5000).
Fig. 2. DMBC has no influence on the relative cerebral blood flow
(rCBF) in rats. Focal ischemia was induced by permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Cortical rCBF values were
recorded 30 min before and monitored continuously for 120 min
post-pMCAO. DMBC 25 mg/kg or vehicle was administered ip 60 min
after the onset of the ischemia. The data were normalized to the
baseline of each group and rCBF was expressed as the percentage
of the baseline. There were no significant differences between DMBC

Immunostaining for brain slices and cultured cells
The distribution of cathepsin B in the ischemic cortex,
astrocytes or HT22 cells was examined by
immunofluorescence assay.
For immunostaining of cells, after various treatments,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at
4C, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min,
and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at room
temperature. Cells were then incubated with rabbit anticathepsin
B polyclonal antibody (1:100, 06-480,
Millipore) and mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody
(1:1000, C9205, Sigma) overnight at 4C followed by
FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:300,
F6005, Sigma) or by Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit
IgG (H + L)(1:500, A11012, Life technologies) for 1 h in
the dark at room temperature. After being washed with
PBS, cells were incubated in 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI, C1005, Beyotime; 1:1000) solution
for 10 min in the dark and then analyzed with a
fluorescent microscope or a confocal microscope
(LSM710, ZEISS Co, Germany).
Immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously
described (Qin et al., 2010). Brain sections were
immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-cathepsin B
(Millipore, 06–480, 1:100) overnight at 4C, and then
incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor-labeled goat antirabbit
IgG (H + L) (1:500, A11012, Life technologies) at
room temperature. After being washed with PBS, sections
were incubated in Hochest (Hochest, 1:10,000, 94,403,
Sigma) solution for 10 min in the dark and then analyzed
with a confocal microscope.
Statistical analysis
All values are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was made by a two-tailed Student’s t-test
between two groups, or by a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Tukey test
among multiple groups. P< 0.05 was considered
significant.
RESULTS
DMBC does not affect the rCBF
In randomly selected rats (n= 3 for each group), the
cortical rCBF was continuously measured from 30 min
before pMCAO and 120 min after pMCAO. Compared to
sham-operated rats, the rCBF in pMCAO or pMCAO
+ DMBC rats was significantly decreased after pMCAO,
and there were no significant differences between those
two groups at each time point (Fig. 2), suggesting that
DMBC has no effect on the rCBF.
DMBC produces neuroprotection against pMCAO
insult
DMBC treatment at 1 h after pMCAO significantly reduced
infarction volume (Fig. 3A, B), improved neurological
impairment score (Fig. 4A), increased the grip strength
(Fig. 4B) and decreased the right forelimb use (Fig. 4C)
at 24 h following pMCAO, and markedly increased the
protein levels of MAP2 (Fig. 5A, C) and GFAP
(Fig. 5B, D) at 12 h after ischemia, compared to the
vehicle-treated groups (pMCAO group). DMBC 25 mg/kg
treatment also reduced infarction volume (Fig. 3C, D),
improved neurological impairment score (Fig. 4D),
increased the grip strength (Fig. 4E) and decreased the
right forelimb use (Fig. 4F) even when administered at
6 h after the onset of ischemia. These results suggest
that DMBC has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral
ischemic injury.
DMBC directly protects HT22 cell and astrocytes
against OGD insult
Next, we determined if DMBC could directly protect
neuronal cells or astrocytes in OGD-induced HT22 cells
or astrocytes injury. As shown in Figs. 6and 7, DMBC
at 0.1, 1, 10, 50lM alone did not alter the number of
HT22 cells or astrocytes and the leakage of LDH in
HT22 cells (Fig. 6A, B) and astrocytes (Fig. 7A, B),
compared to the non-OGD control group, indicating that
DMBC at these concentrations has no toxicity on
cultured HT22 cells or astrocytes. Exposing to OGD for
12 h, the number of HT22 cells (Fig. 6A) or astrocytes
(Fig. 7A) was markedly decreased, and the leakage of
LDH was significantly increased when compared to the
non-OGD HT22 cells (Fig. 6B) or astrocytes (Fig. 7B).
In addition, the protein level of GFAP was significantly
decreased in astrocytes treated with OGD (Fig. 8A, B).

In contrast, DMBC treatment led to a protection at 0.1, 1,
10 and 50lM on HT22 cells or on astrocytes showing an
increase in the number of HT22 cells (Fig. 6A) or
astrocytes (Fig. 7A), a decrease in the leakage of LDH
(Figs. 6B; 7B) and an increase in the GFAP protein
levels (Fig. 8A, B). Furthermore, the annexin V and PI
fluorescence analysis revealed that DMBC treatment
also decreased OGD-induced both apoptosis and
necrosis of astrocyte cells (Fig. 9). These data indicate
that DMBC can directly protect HT22 cells and
astrocytes against OGD injury.

(Fig. 10A, C), while in primary cultured rat astrocytes or in
rat brain, we could detect two active cathepsin B bands of
30 kDa and 25 kDa (Fig. 10E, G). This discrepancy may
result from the different species of rat and mouse. OGD
could mediate an increase in active cathepsin B at 1–
6 h and a peak at 6 h after OGD in HT22 cells
(Fig. 10A –D) or at 6 h in astrocytes (Fig. 10E, F), and
DMBC treatment inhibited the OGD-induced increases
in active cathepsin B in HT22 cells (Fig. 10C, D) or
astrocytes (Fig. 10E, F). Consistent with the in vitro
data, ischemia also induced an increase in active
cathepsin B at 6 h after ischemia in the ischemic cortex,
and DMBC treatment reduced the ischemia-induced
increases in active cathepsin B (Fig. 10G, H). These
results indicate that DMBC’s neuroprotective effect
against cerebral ischemia might be associated with
inhibition of the cathepsin B activation.
DMBC treatment blocks the ischemia or
OGD-induced release of cathepsin B from the
lysosome into the cytoplasm in the ischemic cortex
or in astrocytes or HT22 cells
We next observed the effects of DMBC on the release of
cathepsin B from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm in the
ischemic cortex cells or in the OGD-induced HT22 cells or
astrocytic cell injury with immunostaining. As shown in
Figs. 11, 12 and 13, in the sham-operated cortex cells
(Fig. 11), or in non-OGD HT22 cells (Fig. 12), or in non-
OGD astrocytes (Fig. 13), less fine granular perinuclear
cathepsin B immunoreactivity was seen, which was
consistent with the predominantly lysosomal location of
cathepsin B (Hill et al., 1997; Seyfried et al., 1997;
Benchoua et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2014). In the ischemic
cortex cells, or in HT22 cells or astrocytes treated with
OGD, cathepsin B granules developed into larger and

irregular aggregates or diffuse cytoplasmic stainings at
6 h post-ischemia or post-OGD, suggesting an increased
leakage of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm.
In contrast, DMBC treatments reduced the aggregates
or diffuse cytoplasmic stainings of cathepsin B in
the ischemic cortex cells (Fig. 11), or in the OGD-
induced HT22 cells (Fig. 12) or astrocytic cells injury
(Fig. 13), indicating that DMBC might play a role in the
increase of lysosomal membrane stabilization following
ischemia or OGD.
DISCUSSION
2-(30,50-Dimethoxybenzylidene) cyclopentanone (DMBC)
is a novel small-molecule compound synthesized by
our group. More recently, we reported that autophagy
and cathepsin L are involved in the antinociceptive
effect of DMBC in a mouse acetic acid-writhing model
(Gu et al., 2013). In the current study, we firstly found
that DMBC 1–25 mg/kg, administered ip at 1 h after
ischemia, reduced the infarct volume, improved the

of cathepsin B was characterized by less fine perinuclear granules consistent with its lysosomal localization. After ischemia, fine granular cathepsin
B immunoreactivity was replaced by enlarged granules or diffused cytoplasmic staining, suggesting the leakage of the enzyme from the lysosomes
into the cytosol. DMBC treatment reduced the enlarged granules and diffused cytoplasmic staining of cathepsin B, indicating that DMBC blocks the
release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into the cytosol. (B) Quantification of cathepsin B fluorescent intensity. The data are expressed as the

neurological deficits and increased the expression of
MAP2 and GFAP at late stages of 12–24 h ischemia,
suggesting that DMBC has neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia. DMBC 25 mg/kg also has a
neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia even administered
at 6 h following the onset of ischemia, indicating
that DMBC offers an extended window for neuroprotection.
In addition, we have demonstrated that the toxicity
of DMBC is very low showing that the LD
50
of DMBC
for ip injection is more than 700 mg/kg and the LD
50
of DMBC for intragastric administration is more than
2800 mg/kg (data not shown). Therefore, DMBC may
own a larger safety margin in the treatment of ischemic
stroke.
We next found that DMBC treatment significantly
decreased the OGD-induced LDH leakage in both HT22
cell and astrocytes, suggesting that DMBC may directly
protect neuronal cell and astrocytes against cerebral
ischemia.
Third, we found that DMBC’s neuroprotection against
cerebral ischemia might be at least partially associated
with inhibition of the cathepsin B activation. Cathepsin B
is one of the most abundant cysteine proteases in brain
and one of the major neuronal lysosomal proteases that
has important functions in intracellular protein
catabolism (Yamashima and Oikawa, 2009). Lysosomal
cathepsins, including cathepsin B, are translated as inactive
pro-enzymes and matured to active enzymes via proteolytic
cleavage only when exposed to the acidic
environments of late endosomes and lysosomes
(Gieselmann et al., 1985; Mach et al., 1993; Sleat et al.,
2006; Windelborn and Lipton, 2008). This process
ensures that these proteases are separated from
essential cellular proteins and contributes to a lysosomal

environment necessary for the homeostatic turnover of
proteins and other cellular materials (De Duve, 2005;
Windelborn and Lipton, 2008). Cathepsins were traditionally
considered to cause cellular autolysis and damage to
neighboring cells during necrosis. Growing in vitro as well
as in vivo studies now suggest that cathepsins may also
act as mediators of programed cell death. An increase
in both expression and enzymatic activities of cathepsins
B is observed after transient global and focal cerebral
ischemia, which contributes to the process of neuronal
or astrocytic cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, and inhibition
of cathepsins B confers neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia (Kohda et al., 1996; Seyfried
et al., 1997; Yamashima et al., 1998; Nitatori et al.,
1995; Durmaz et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2008;
Windelborn and Lipton, 2008; Chaitanya and Babu,
2009; Hou et al., 2010; Ozden et al., 2011; Xu et al.,
2014). It has been demonstrated that the leakage of lysosomal
hydrolytic enzymes into the cytosol causes necrosis
or apoptosis, depending on the magnitude of
lysosomal rupture (Benchoua et al., 2004). Benchoua
et al. have shown that the release of cathepsin B directly
causes the activation of caspase-11 and caspase-1 in the
early stages of cortical infarction after permanent MCAO
in mice (Brunk et al., 1997). Accordingly, our recent
observations have shown that the activation of cathepsin
B contributes to ischemia-induced astrocyte apoptosis via
tBid-mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (Xu et al., 2014).
We found that DMBC treatment decreased
OGD-induced apoptosis and necrosis of astrocyte cells.
In the meantime, DMBC treatment inhibited the ischemia
or OGD-induced activation of cathepsin B in the ischemic
cortex or in HT22 cells and astrocytes. These results suggested
that DMBC’s neuroprotection might be at least
partially associated with inhibition of the cathepsin B activation
in both ischemic neuronal and astrocytic cells.
We and other have identified that cathepsin B
movement into the cytosol can be used as a measure
of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) both
in neurons (Windelborn and Lipton, 2008) and in
Fig. 13. DMBC inhibits the OGD-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosome to the cytosol in astrocytes with immunofluorescence analysis.

astrocytes (Xu et al., 2014). Our further investigation demonstrated
that in non-ischemic cortex cells, or in non-OGD
astrocytes or HT22 cells, cathepsin B staining appeared
punctate. Following 6 h ischemia or OGD, cathepsin B
accumulated in the cytosol showing the diffuse distribution
in ischemic cortex cells, or in astrocytes or HT22
cells, suggesting that ischemia or OGD causes an
increase in lysosomal membrane permeabilization and
a translocation of cathepsin B from the lysosome to
the cytoplasm. In contrast, DMBC treatment blocked
the diffuse distribution of cathepsin B, indicating that
DMBC might play a role in the decrease of lysosomal
membrane permeabilization following ischemia or OGD.
It is well known that oxidative stress underlies cell
death in several pathological conditions, including
ischemia, and one of the detrimental effects of oxidative
stress is causing lysosomal rupture. Lysosomal
membrane becomes more susceptible to additional
damage when inflicted by free radicals or ROS (Coyle
and Puttfarcken, 1993; Beal, 1996; Owen et al., 1996;
Simonian and Coyle, 1996; Jenner, 1998; Halliwell,
2001) because the incorporation of molecular oxygen into
polyunsaturated fatty acids initiates a chain of reactions.
ROS, especially hydroxyl radicals, can produce functional
alterations in lipids and proteins. It is likely that oxidative
lipid damage (lipid peroxidation) causes loss of membrane
fluidity and increment of membrane permeability
(Pignol et al., 2006). In the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative
diseases, ROS production by targeting the
mitochondria and the ER and inflammation form a positive
loop (Zhang and Kaufman, 2008).
It has been demonstrated that some dual inhibitors
of COX and lipoxygenases (LOX) enzymes containing
a-[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene] heterocyclic
pentanone in their molecular structures, have antiinflammatory
action such as darbufelone and S-2474
(Yagami et al., 2005; Moreau et al., 2006; Ye et al.,
2010). And also the cerebroprotective potential of resveratrol
is through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms
in rats (Orsu et al., 2013). In the molecular
structure of DMBC, there is aa-[3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene]
cyclopentanone which contains 3,5-dihydroxystyrene
structure of resveratrol and a cyclopentanone which is an
analogous structure of the heterocyclic ring in the structures
of darbufelone and S-2474 (Fig. 1). Therefore, we
speculate that DMBC may produce anti-inflammatory and
anti-oxidant effects, which lead to inhibiting the ROS
production-inflammationpositive loop, and in turndecreasing
the lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Whether
DMBC has the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects
which are associated with a reduction of ROS production
and stabilization of lysosomal membrane remains to be
further investigated.
In addition, based on our current data, we do not
know whether the effect of the inhibition of the
cathepsin B activation by DMBC is the secondary
effect of DMBC following the role in decreasing the
lysosomal membrane permeabilization, or it is the
direct inhibitory effect of DMBC on the cathepsin B
enzyme activity. This issue will also be further studied
in the very near future.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the present study provides the first evidence
that DMBC, a novel small-molecule compound, produces
neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia, and its
mechanism might be associated with inhibition of the
cathepsin B activation and its release from the
lysosome to the cytoplasm. Considering its extended
window for neuroprotection and lower toxicity, DMBC
may become a promising agent to be translated into
clinical trials.
