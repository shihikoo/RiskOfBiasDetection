BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can be neuroprotective. However, endogenous choline and ACh
have not been regarded as potent neuroprotective agents because physiological levels of choline/ACh do not produce
neuroprotective levels of α7 activation. This limitation may be overcome by the use of type-II positive allosteric modulators
(PAMs-II) of α7 nAChRs, such as 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-urea (PNU-120596). This
proof-of-concept study presents a novel neuroprotective paradigm that converts endogenous choline/ACh into potent
neuroprotective agents in cerebral ischaemia by inhibiting α7 nAChR desensitization using PNU-120596.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
An electrophysiological ex vivo cell injury assay (to quantify the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to acute injury by
complete oxygen and glucose deprivation; COGD) and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischaemia were
used in rats.
KEY RESULTS
Choline (20–200 μM) in the presence, but not absence of 1 μM PNU-120596 significantly delayed anoxic
depolarization/injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, but not CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons, subjected to
COGD in acute hippocampal slices and these effects were blocked by 20 nM methyllycaconitine, a selective α7 antagonist,
thus, activation of α7 nAChRs was required. PNU-120596 alone was ineffective ex vivo. In in vivo experiments, both pre- and
post-ischaemia treatments with PNU-120596 (30 mg·kg−1, s.c. and 1 mg·kg−1, i.v., respectively) significantly reduced the
cortical/subcortical infarct volume caused by transient focal cerebral ischaemia. PNU-120596 (1 mg·kg−1, i.v., 30 min
post-ischaemia) remained neuroprotective in rats subjected to a choline-deficient diet for 14 days prior to experiments.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
PNU-120596 and possibly other PAMs-II significantly improved neuronal survival in cerebral ischaemia by augmenting
neuroprotective effects of endogenous choline/ACh.

Introduction
Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United
States and over 85% of all strokes are ischaemic strokes (Beal,
2010; Roger et al., 2012). Over one third of stroke victims do
not survive the incidence of stroke; while over 90% of stroke
survivors suffer from permanent neurological deficits
(Jorgensen et al., 1999; Roger et al., 2012). Clinical management
of neuronal damage resulting from ischaemic stroke
generally involves only palliative treatments. Currently, the
only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug therapy
for ischaemic stroke involves the i.v. use of tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) to dissolve clots (Furlan, 2002). This strategy
appears to be effective in ischaemic stroke, but only
within the first 3 h after the onset of ischaemic stroke (Brott
and Bogousslavsky, 2000; Adams et al., 2007). These strict
limitations reduce the percent of stroke patients eligible for
tPA to as low as ∼2% (Katzan et al., 2000). Although in the last
two decades, substantial efforts have been invested in developing
neuroprotective medicine, these efforts have not
resulted in clinically efficacious therapies for ischaemic stroke
(Richard Green et al., 2003). These failures highlight the need
for development of new concepts, therapeutic ideas and
approaches for neuronal protection and prevention of neuronal
damage secondary to ischaemia. In this search, strategies
that are based on recruiting and activating endogenous
pathways receive special attention as these approaches are
expected to be highly efficacious and cause fewer adverse
effects than approaches that utilize exogenous agents (Lo,
2008; Uteshev, 2012a). Development of these drug therapies
would be expected to specifically benefit individuals from
high-risk groups for ischaemic stroke (Roger et al., 2012).
There is a growing pool of supportive evidence linking
activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to
enhanced neuronal survival and resistance to ischaemia and
other insults (Meyer et al., 1998; Shimohama et al., 1998; Li
et al., 1999; Rosa et al., 2006; Guseva et al., 2008), as well as
improved cognitive performance in patients and animal
models of schizophrenia (Olincy et al., 2006; Olincy and
Stevens, 2007), dementia (Kem, 2000; Ren et al., 2007; Bitner
et al., 2010) and traumatic brain injury (Guseva et al., 2008).
This study is a proof of concept that introduces a novel
approach to reduction of neuronal injury secondary to ischaemia
by augmenting neuroprotective effects of endogenous
choline/ACh. Choline is a full selective agonist of α7 nAChRs
(Papke et al., 1996; Alkondon et al., 1997), a ubiquitous cell
membrane-building material and a precursor metabolite of
ACh. However, at physiological levels (i.e. <20 μM) and pathophysiological
levels (i.e. >20 μM) expected in the penumbra of
brain injury (Klein et al., 1998; Sarter and Parikh, 2005),
choline alone is ineffective as an α7 nAChR agonist because of
its low potency for α7 activation (EC
50
∼0.5 mM; Papke and
Papke, 2002) and tendency to induce α7 desensitization
(IC
50
∼40 μM; Uteshev et al., 2003). As a result, choline has not
previously garnered much attention as a potential neuroprotective
agent. These limitations may be overcome by the use
of a previously reported novel class of compounds, type-II
positive allosteric modulators (PAMs-II) of α7 nAChRs, such as
1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-
urea (PNU12596) (Hurst et al., 2005; Gusev and Uteshev,
2010; Kalappa et al., 2010; Uteshev, 2012a,b). PNU-120596
does not activate α7 nAChRs, but it inhibits desensitization
and enhances activation of α7 nAChRs by nicotinic agonists,
including choline and ACh (Hurst et al., 2005; Gusev and
Uteshev, 2010; Kalappa et al., 2010). In the presence of PNU-
120596, endogenous levels of choline/ACh may become neuroprotective
by producing a weak persistent and tunable
modality of α7 nAChR activation (Gusev and Uteshev, 2010;
Kalappa et al., 2010; Sitzia et al., 2011; Uteshev, 2012b).
However, excessive activation of α7 nAChRs can be neurotoxic
(Del Barrio et al., 2011; Dinklo et al., 2011) because of
the high permeability of α7 nAChR-mediated ion channels to
Ca2+ions (Verninoet al., 1992; Castro and Albuquerque, 1995;
Fucile, 2004; Uteshev, 2010).
This study tests the hypothesis that PNU-120596 converts
physiological/endogenous choline/ACh into potent neuroprotective
agents in both ex vivo and in vivo experimental
models of ischaemic stroke. To conduct these tests, an electrophysiological
neuronal injury assay was developed and
applied to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1
interneurons in whole-cell current-clamp patch-clamp experiments
in rat acute hippocampal slices subjected to complete
oxygen and glucose deprivation (COGD). The COGD protocol
was used in acute hippocampal slices (ex vivo) to model conditions
that are likely present in the core (as opposed to the
penumbra) of the ischaemic injury where neuronal injury and
death can be delayed, but not eliminated (Lo, 2008). The
effects of s.c. and i.v. administration of PNU-120596 on the
ischaemic infarct volume within cortical and subcortical brain
regions of the forebrain were evaluated in in vivoexperiments
in rats using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model of stroke. Some in vivo experiments were done in rats
that were subjected to a choline-deficient diet for 14 days
prior to experimentation. The results of this study support the
hypothesis that PAMs-II can recruit and activate endogenous
agonists of α7 nAChRs (i.e. choline and ACh) to significantly
enhance neuronal survival in cerebral ischaemia.
Materials and methods
Animals
Young adult male Sprague-Dawley (S.-D.) rats (a total of 181
animals) were used for ex vivo (∼150 g) and in vivo (∼280 g)
experiments. The animal use was in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
865-23, Bethesda, MD), and all experimental protocols were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Southern
Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL and
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University
of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, TX.
All studies involving animals are reported in accordance with
the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010).
Choline-deficient diet
Male S.-D. rats (∼150 g) were purchased from Charles Rivers
Laboratories International, Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA) and
subjected to an ad libitum choline-deficient diet (TD.88052;
Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 14 days
upon arrival to the UNTHSC. Water was given ad libitum.

Animal’s weight was measured every 3 days. After 14 days,
animals whose weight exceeded 260 g were selected for
experimentation. Underweight animals were used for other
projects. The average weight gain of choline-deficient rats
(∼5.5% per day) was comparable with that reported for
choline-sufficient rats of the same age (∼5.8% per day)
(http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/rm_rm_c_
sprague_dawley_rats.pdf).
Tissue preparation
Coronal whole-brain slices of 250–300 μm thickness containing
hippocampal CA1 region were cut in a sucrose-rich
solution at 3°C using Vibratome-1000 + slicer (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) upon euthanizing via rapid
decapitation. The sucrose-rich solution was of the following
composition (in mM): sucrose 250, KCl 3, NaH

and 5% CO

). Slices were
then transferred to a temporary storage chamber where they
were maintained for ∼30 min at 30°C in an oxygenated artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) of the following composition
(in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 3, NaH

chamber and maintained at room temperature for up to 6 h
bubbled with carbogen.
Patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute
brain slices
The recording chamber (volume 2 mL) was perfused with
oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 1 mL·min−1 using a perfusion
pump (Model73160-20, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA).
Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1 stratum radiatum
interneurons in brain slices were selected on the basis of
their morphology and location within the slice as reported
previously (Kalappa et al., 2010). Neurons were visually
selected for electrophysiological recordings using an Olympus
BX-51WI microscope (Olympus Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA).
Conventional whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological
recordings were conducted using a MultiClamp-700B amplifier
equipped with Digidata-1440A A/D converter (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The membrane resting potential
was continuously recorded in the current-clamp configuration.
Data were filtered at 2–4 kHz, sampled at 10 kHz and
stored on a personal computer. Patch pipettes were pulled
using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments,
Novato, CA, USA). The pipette resistance was 4–6 MΩ when
filled with the internal solution. The access resistances
(<30 MΩ) were not compensated. The extracellular recording
solution was identical to ACSF used for the tissue preparation.
The patch electrode solution contained (in mM): K-gluconate
140, NaCl 1, MgCl
2
2, Mg-ATP 2, Na-GTP 0.3, HEPES 10, KOH
0.42 (pH 7.4). Membrane voltages were not corrected for the
liquid junction potential: V
LJ
(K-gluconate) = 16.2 mV. All ex
vivo experiments were conducted at 30–32°C.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation and pretreatment
of acute hippocampal slices with
PNU-120596 and choline
CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1 interneurons in acute hippocampal
slices subjected to COGD (i.e. no reperfusion) were
used in all experiments. COGD was achieved by a continuous
perfusion of slices with an oxygen-glucose deprived ACSF (i.e.
COGD-ACSF) containing 10 mM sucrose instead of 10 mM
glucose and bubbled with 95% N
2
+5%CO
2
instead of carbogen
(i.e. 95% O
2
+ 5% CO 
2
). Hippocampal slices were
prepared as described above and then, randomly separated
into two groups, ‘control’ or ‘treatment’, and stored for
∼40 min in a chamber perfused with a standard ACSF bubbled
with carbogen at room temperature. ‘Treatment’ slices were
then transferred to ‘treatment’ chamber and subjected to a
specific treatment for 3 h: for example, 20 μM choline +1 μM
PNU-120596. ‘Control’ slices were transferred to ‘control’
chamber and incubated in standard ACSF for the same
duration. After treatments, slices were transferred into the
recording chamber where they remained perfused in the corresponding
solutions during recordings. To initiate COGD,
standard ACSF was replaced with COGD-ACSF by switching
solutions that enter the recording chamber. The solution
exchange delay time (i.e. time necessary to replace the system
’s ‘dead’ volume after a solution switch) was estimated
using high concentrations of a food dye (203 ± 13 s, n =3)
and not subtracted from data.
Electrophysiological cell injury assay
Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1 stratum
radiatum interneurons in acute coronal slices subjected to
COGD were used in all experiments. In total, 107 hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal neurons and 16 stratum radiatum
interneurons were used in this study. Each hippocampal slice
was used only for one experiment utilizing COGD and only
one neuron was tested in each slice. Each treatment with
nicotinic agents had its own control data. This was achieved
by using slices obtained from the same animal and preparation
for both control (i.e. COGD only) and treatment (i.e.
COGD + PNU + choline) sets of experiments to ensure the
presence of control data sets for each animal and preparation.
An electrophysiological cell injury assay was developed
and used in this study to achieve a reliable and continuous
quantification of the evolution of neuronal anoxic depolarization
and injury. Similar approaches have been used previously
to study the effects of OGD on the mechanisms of cell
death (Tanaka et al., 1997; Dijkhuizen et al., 1999; Rossi et al.,
2000). The effects of choline + PNU-120596 pretreatment on
the status of neuronal health or injury were determined by
continuous recordings of the neuronal membrane potential
before and during the insult (i.e. COGD) or treatment (i.e.
choline + PNU-120596) using the conventional currentclamp
whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology: healthy
cells were defined by the normal resting membrane potential
(i.e. near-60 mV), while injured cells were defined by depolarized
membrane potentials (i.e. more positive than-50 mV)
and dead cells were assumed to have the resting membrane
potential near 0 mV. Therefore, the evolution of acute neuronal
depolarization/injury by COGD was monitored in real
time and injury curves were built and used for analysis. To
build averaged injury curves, data points pertaining to individual
injury curves obtained under identical experimental
conditions (e.g. control or treatment) were averaged pointby-point
across all neurons in a given group. However, the
mean T
50
values presented in Figures 2–3 were the averages
of T
50
obtained from the corresponding individual injury

curves, not the T
50
values obtained from the averaged injury
curves. While the end result of OGD may be the same (i.e.
neuronal depolarization/injury or death defined as a loss of
the ionic gradient and the resting membrane potential), the
injury curves may be different for different cell types and
experimental treatments. Reperfusion of neurons defined as
dead (i.e. the neuronal membrane potential was near 0 mV)
with normal ACSF did not hyperpolarize the neuronal membrane
potential supporting the definition. Transient or partial
oxygen-glucose deprivation models where oxygen and/or
glucose were briefly or only partially removed from ACSF
were not investigated in this study.
Electrophysiological data analysis
The neuronal membrane potential was recorded in 10 s episodes
without any delays between episodes to generate the
mean membrane potential every 10 s. Thus, six means were
generated every minute of recordings and the resulting injury
curves were used for analysis (Figure 1). Action potentials
were ignored during analysis and the membrane potential in
between the neighbouring action potentials was used for
analysis. For clarity, some illustrations were made using only
every other means (i.e. three means per minute of recordings
). The neuronal depolarization/injury was quantified by
half-time to the membrane voltage 0 mV (i.e. T
50
). Neurons
not subjected to COGD maintained their resting membrane
potentials relatively constant (n = 8; Figures 1A,B and 2A). By
contrast, all tested neurons subjected to COGD depolarized to
0 mV as a result and thus, were defined as dead (Figures 1C–F
and 2B–F). For each neuron, T
50
was estimated as duration
from the moment of solution switch (i.e. t = 0) to the point
where the membrane voltage drops 50% from its initial value
(i.e. at t= 0). The T
50
was then estimated by assuming that the
membrane potential between the data points just above (T
1
,
V
1
) and just below (T
2
, V
2
) the point of 50% drop (i.e. within
a maximum of <10 s of recordings) was a linear function of
time: T
50
= T
1
+( T
2
− T
1
)*(V
1
− 50)/(V
1
− V
2
). In this analysis, V
was normalized to the resting membrane potential at t =0to
reduce interneuronal variability in the membrane resting
potentials. The T
50
obtained under control (i.e. COGD only)
and treated (i.e. COGD + treatments) conditions and averaged
over the corresponding sets of neurons were compared
using the standard unpaired two-tailed Student’s test (Graph-
Pad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Data fitting was done
using ProStat analysis packages (Pearl River, NY, USA). Statistical
significance was defined by the P-value (i.e. P < 0.05).
Graphs were built using GraphPad and ProStat data analysis
software packages. Data were presented as means ± SEM.
MCAO and infarct volume measurement
The results obtained in ex vivo experiments (Figures 1–4) suggested
that PNU-120596 may produce significant neuroprotection in vivo. To test this hypothesis, transient focal cerebral
ischaemia was induced using the suture occlusion technique
as previously described (Jin et al., 2001). Animals (n = 64;
Charles River) were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane mixed
with 67% N
2
O and 29% O
2
and delivered by a mask. After a
midline incision in the neck, the left external carotid artery
(ECA) was carefully exposed and dissected. A 19 mm, 4-0
monofilament nylon suture was inserted from the ECA into
the left internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of left
middle cerebral artery. After 90 min of occlusion, the thread
was removed to allow reperfusion. The ECA was ligated, and
the wound was closed. Rectal temperature was maintained at
∼37°C using a heating pad.
Rats were anaesthetized and decapitated 24 h after
MCAO. Brains were removed and coronal sections (2 mm
thickness) immersed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
in saline for 20 min at 37°C, then fixed for 2 h in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Bederson et al., 1986). Infarct area, left
hemisphere area and total brain area were measured by a
blinded observer using the Image J software, and areas were
multiplied by the distance between sections to obtain the
respective volumes. Infarct volume was calculated as a percentage
of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere, as
described previously (Swanson et al., 1990). Statistical significance
was defined by the P-value (i.e. P < 0.05) using the
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.
MS analysis of PNU-120596 amounts in
brain/blood samples
Animals were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane mixed with
67% N
2
O and 29% O
2
(delivered by a mask) and perfused with
ACSF. Samples of blood and hippocampal, frontal cortical
and striatal brain tissues were collected, flash-frozen using
liquid nitrogen, stored at -80°C at UNTHSC (Fort Worth, TX,
USA) and shipped on dry ice overnight to Carbon Dynamics
Institute, LLC (Springfield, IL, USA) for MS analyses. Subsamples
were macerated with methanol for 3 min and the resultant
slurry was centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 15 000× g.
Blood samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 19 000×
g. The resultant supernatant for both preparations was further
purified using a mixed-mode polymeric exchange solid phase
extraction (SPE). The eluate was lyophilized and reconstituted
in the initial mobile phase. PNU-120596 was analysed by a
one microliter injection of each sample aliquot into a Waters
2795 Alliance equipped with a XBridge BEH130 C
18
2.1 mm ×
150 mm, 3.5 μm particulate column (110 Å) at a flow rate of
0.150 mL·min−1; a binary mobile phase gradient at 50:50
(Δ2.5%) A : B in 20 min (Mobil phase A = 0.01% formic acid;
Mobil phase B = acetonitrile) until proper peak shape, separation
and reduction of interferences were obtained. Waters
Quattro Ultima triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer
equipped with an electrospray ionization source was
calibrated with methionine-arginine-phenylalanine-alanine
peptide for both the single and double charge state (m/z
524.2 and 262.6, respectively) to provide a 0.1 amu mass
accuracy for each [M + H]+ parent ion (m
p
+). The m
p
+ ion 312
from Q1 was passed through a collision chamber (Q2), operating
in radio-frequency-only mode (23 V), and focused for
subsequent ionization as a consequence of the collision of the
rapidly moving m
p
+ with an inert gas (Ar) at ∼1.8 mTorr to
produce the unique product fragmentation spectrum that
was subsequently scanned through a third mass filter (Q3)
where selected daughter ions (m
d
+) were collected in multiple
resonance monitoring (transitions 312 > 188 173.99).

injury curves (i.e. D and F) indicates the mean normalized membrane potential calculated over a 10 s episode as a function of time from solution
switch (from ACSF to COGD-ACSF). There was no solution switch in experiments without OGD (i.e. A–B). Each injury curve (i.e. C–D and E–F)

investigated on different experimental days. Regular downward voltage deviations in E were hyperpolarizing (−20 pA) steps used in some
recordings to determine the neuronal input resistance. Depolarization-induced action potentials clearly seen in the raw recordings (C and E) were
ignored during analysis and thus, are not represented in the normalized injury curves (D and F). Two strong spontaneous bursts of action potentials
in A are represented as small downward deviations in B.

PNU-120596
In ex vivo experiments, 1 μM PNU-120596 was used. This
concentration lies near the EC
50
for potentiating effects
of PNU-120596 in heterologous systems (EC
50
∼1.5 μM;
Gronlien et al., 2007; Young et al., 2008). Intravenous administration
of 1 mg·kg−1 PNU-120596 has been shown to elevate
the concentration of PNU-120596 in the brains of rats to
similar values (∼1.5 μM; Hurst et al., 2005). In in vivo experiments
, 1 mg·kg−1 (in vivo, i.v.). and 30 mg·kg−1 (in vivo, s.c.)
were used. Similar doses have been used in other studies
(Hurst et al., 2005; McLean et al., 2011). PNU-120596 is a
highly lipophilic compound and thus, can be trapped by the
tissue near the s.c. injection site. Therefore, the dose used for
s.c. injections was chosen higher than that for i.v. injections
to compensate for that possibility. To make a 50 mM stock
solution (maximal achievable concentration is ∼200 mM),
PNU-120596 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
However, the amount of DMSO injected in each animal did
not exceed 2 mL·kg−1. The appropriate amounts of 50 mM
stock solution PNU + DMSO or DMSO alone (i.e. control)
were injected as a bolus s.c. (30 mg·kg−1) or i.v. (1 mg·kg−1).
Results
This study used ex vivo (i.e. COGD) and in vivo (i.e. MCAO)
experimental approaches to test the hypothesis that PNU-
120596, a type-II PAM of α7 nAChRs, converts physiological/
endogenous choline/ACh into potent neuroprotective agents
via activation of α7 nAChRs. All ex vivo patch-clamp experiments
were conducted at 30–32°C.
Injury curves and quantification of the
evolution of COGD-induced acute
neuronal injury
Subjecting acute hippocampal slices to COGD resulted in a
permanent loss of the ionic gradient and depolarization of
the neuronal membrane potential leading to neuronal injury
and death. The stages of neuronal injury were quantified by
the time-dependent decrease in the neuronal membrane
potential (i.e. anoxic depolarization), a key parameter defining
the status of neuronal health and the evolution of neuronal
injury (i.e. injury curves). Figure 1 illustrates typical
examples of the raw (recorded in current-clamp) and the
normalized individual injury curves obtained from two hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal neurons subjected to either control
(no COGD, no pretreatment with choline + PNU-120596,
Figure 1A,B) or COGD conditions (COGD, but no pretreatment
with choline + PNU-120596, Figure 1C,D) and one hippocampal
CA1 stratum radiatum interneuron subjected to
COGD without pretreatment with choline + PNU-120596
(Figure 1E,F). As expected, neuronal depolarization/injury
did not occur in the absence of COGD (Figure 1A,B) and thus,
the value of half-time to 0 mV (i.e. T
50
, see Methods) was not
defined. Similar results were obtained in five control experiments
and three preparations. By contrast, neurons illustrated
in Figure 1C,E were subjected to COGD and exhibited
injury curves with the following T
50
values: T
50
(pyramidal) =
707.5 s (Figure 1D) and T
50
(inter) = 655.7 s (Figure 1F). These
experiments were conducted using neurons obtained from
different preparations.
Pretreatment with 20 M choline +
1 M PNU-120596
Two groups of acute hippocampal slices obtained from the
same animal and preparation were pretreated for 3 h either in
standard ACSF (i.e. control group) or ACSF containing 20 μM
choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 (i.e. treatment group). The T
50
estimated from individual injury curves were then averaged
for each neuronal sub-type and experimental condition and
the mean values were compared across the corresponding
groups (unpaired, two-tailed Student test). Figure 2A–D illustrates
averaged injury curves built for four sets of controls and
treatments: (i) No OGD after pretreatment with 20 μM
choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 (n = 3; Figure 2A; the error bars
are invisible); (ii) control (COGD, no pretreatment, open
circles, Figure 2B) versus pretreatment of CA1 pyramidal
neurons with 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 (closed
circles, Figure 2B); (iii) control (COGD, no pretreatment,
open circles, Figure 2C) versus pretreatment of CA1 pyramidal
neurons with 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 +
20 nM MLA (closed circles, Figure 2C) and (iv) control
(COGD, no pretreatment, open circles, Figure 2D) versus pretreatment
of CA1 interneurons with 20 μM choline + 1 μM
PNU-120596 (closed circles, Figure 2D).
The results of analysis of these experiments (unpaired,
two-tailed Student’s t-test) were summarized in Table 1 and
demonstrated that pretreatment of acute hippocampal
slices with 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 significantly
delayed the COGD-induced acute injury and the corresponding
depolarization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons
(Figure 2B), but not CA1 interneurons (Figure 2D). However,
these beneficial effects of 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596
were lost when 20 nM MLA was present in the ACSF during
pretreatment and recordings (Figure 2C) indicating that activation
of α7 nAChRs was required for the effects of choline +
PNU-120596.
Pretreatment of CA1 pyramidal neurons
with 20 M choline alone or 1 M
PNU-120596 alone
When applied alone, 20 μM choline or 1 μM PNU-120596 do
not activate α7 nAChRs (Gusev and Uteshev, 2010; Kalappa
et al., 2010). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that neuroprotection
by choline + PNU-120596 requires α7 nAChR activation
, acute hippocampal slices were pretreated for 3 h in
20 μM choline alone or 1 μM PNU-120596 alone. As
expected, choline alone (closed circles; Figure 2E) and PNU-
120596 alone (closed circles; Figure 2F) did not significantly
delay neuronal depolarization/injury (Table 2) when compared
to control conditions (open circles; Figure 2E,F), as
evidenced by insignificant differences in both T
50
and T

(Table 2). The T
80
was used to test for significant differences
among the earlier phases of injury curves. Therefore, activation
of α7 nAChRs was absolutely required for significant
neuroprotection of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons
subjected to COGD ex vivo.
Pretreatment with 200 M choline +
1 M PNU-120596
Although physiologically relevant concentrations of choline
(i.e. 20 μM) were found to delay the COGD-induced
depolarization/injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons in the presence, but not absence, of 1 μM PNU-
120596 (Figure 2B,E and Table 1), activation of α7 nAChRs
by higher concentrations of choline in the presence of PNU-
120596 may result in neurotoxicity (Del Barrio et al., 2011;
Dinklo et al., 2011) due to the high permeability of α7 ion
channels to Ca2+ ions. To evaluate the resilience of the effects
of choline + PNU-120596, experiments similar to those
described above were conducted using hippocampal CA1
pyramidal neurons and a 10-fold higher concentration of
choline (i.e. 200 μM). At 200 μM, choline may activate α7
nAChRs in the absence of PNU-120596 (Uteshev et al.,
2003). Therefore, three groups of pretreatments were used
(Figure 3): (i) control (ACSF only, no choline, no PNU-
120596; open circles); (ii) 200 μM choline alone (no PNU-
120596; closed circles); and (iii) 200 μM choline + 1 μM
PNU-120596 (open triangles). The T
50
for individual injury
curves were estimated and averaged to calculate the mean T
50
for each group.
The results of these experiments (Table 2) demonstrated
that pretreatment of acute hippocampal slices with 200 μM
choline alone produced neither significant benefits, nor
harm (P = 0.4766 vs. control; open and closed circles,
Figure 3); while pretreatment with 200 μM choline +
1 μM PNU-120596 still significantly delayed neuronal
depolarization/injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons subjected to
COGD (P = 0.0199 vs. control sand P = 0.0118 vs. 200 μM
choline alone; open triangles, Figure 3). Thus, in the presence
of 1 μM PNU-120596, a broad range of choline concentrations
(i.e. 20–200 μM) significantly delay depolarization/
injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons subjected to
COGD ex vivo.

no OGD, but after 3 h of pretreatment in 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 (n = 3); (B) control (COGD, no pretreatment, open circles) versus

(D) control (COGD, no pretreatment, open circles) versus COGD + pretreatment of CA1 interneurons with 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596
(closed circles). As expected, no injury was detected in the absence of OGD (A). Pretreatment with 20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596
significantly delayed injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (P = 0.0097, n = 6) (B), but not CA1 interneurons (D) to COGD (P = 0.2936,
n = 6). These effects were eliminated by 20 nM MLA (P = 0.1841, n = 6), a selective α7 nAChR antagonist, supporting the requirement for α7
nAChR activation (C). (E–F) The results of ex vivo experiments that employed 3 h pretreatment of acute hippocampal slices with 20 μM choline

addition to T
50
, T

was also used to compare the early phase of injury curves under control (open circles) and pretreated (closed circles) conditions.
Pretreatment with 20 μM choline alone (P = 0.8690, n = 10–11) (E) or 1 μM PNU-120596 alone (P = 0.4045, n = 9–11) (F) did not significantly
delay depolarization/injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons induced by COGD supporting the requirement for α7 nAChR activation and
synergistic action of choline and PNU-120596. For illustrations and to build the averaged injury curves, data points pertaining to individual injury
curves obtained under identical experimental conditions (e.g. control or treatments) were averaged point-by-point across all relevant neurons. For
analysis, the T
50
values obtained from the corresponding individual injury curves (e.g. Figure 1) were averaged to determine the mean T

Susceptibility of CA1 pyramidal neurons and
CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons to acute
injury by COGD
Injury curves obtained from subjecting CA1 pyramidal
neurons and interneurons to COGD ex vivo in the absence of
any pretreatments were compared. CA1 interneurons were
found to be significantly more susceptible to COGD than
CA1 pyramidal neurons because T
50
(inter) = 680.7 ± 36.0 s (n
= 6) estimated for CA1 interneurons were significantly
smaller (P = 0.0004; t = 3.95; unpaired, two-tailed Student’s
t-test) than T
50
(pyramidal) = 984.7 ±35.1 s (n= 27) estimated
for CA1 pyramidal neurons.
Lack of involvement of GABAergic
neurotransmission
One possible mechanism that could explain the observed
delay in injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons treated with
choline + PNU-120596 is enhanced GABAergic inhibition of
these neurons in the presence of choline + PNU-120596. CA1
pyramidal neurons are the prime target of GABAergic CA1
interneurons that express high densities of α7 nAChRs sensitive
to PNU-120596 (Kalappa et al., 2010). To test this
hypothesis, experiments similar to those illustrated in

120596 in COGD ex vivo.
PNU-120596-mediated protection in an in
vivo ischaemia model
To test the hypothesis that PNU-120596 produces significant
neuroprotection in vivo, the MCAO model of stroke was
employed in young adult S.-D. rats (∼280 g). The effects of s.c.
administration of PNU-120596 (30 mg·kg−1) 3 h and 24 h
prior to MCAO (i.e. will be referred to as ‘3 h pre-MCAO’ and
‘24 h pre-MCAO’, respectively) as well as i.v. administration
of PNU-120596 (1 mg·kg−1) 30 min after the start of MCAO
(i.e. will be referred to as ‘post-MCAO’) on the infarct volume
measured 24 h after MCAO were evaluated. The expectation
was that PNU-120596 will enhance activation of α7 nAChRs
by endogenous nicotinic agonists to significantly enhance
neuronal resistance to MCAO and thus, significantly reduce
the infarct volume caused by MCAO in both pre- and posttreatment
paradigms. In each of these experiments, only the
left MCA was occluded. In matching control groups of
animals, only vehicle (i.e. DMSO) was injected s.c. or i.v.
respectively. The results of these experiments demonstrated
significant reduction in the infarct volume in 3 h pre-MCAO
as well as post-MCAO treatment groups (unpaired, two-tailed,
Student’s t-test): P = 0.0051 (n = 4, 3 h pre-MCAO;
Figure 5A–C) and P = 0.0413 (n = 5, post-MCAO; Figure 5D–
F). The infarct volume was not significantly affected by PNU-
120596 in the 24 h pre-MCAO treatment group (unpaired,
two-tailed, Student’s t-test): P = 0.5199 (n = 5, 24 h pre-
MCAO; Figure 6).
PNU-120596-mediated protection in animals
subjected to a choline-deficient diet
Although choline-deficient diet has been shown to significantly
reduce only the plasma and not the cerebrospinal
levels of choline (Klein et al., 1998), the effectiveness of
recruiting and activation of endogenous choline/ACh by
PNU-120596 in MCAO experiments may be reduced once the
animals are challenged with choline deficiency. To determine
whether choline deficiency can reduce neuroprotection by
PNU-120596 in MCAO experiments, S.-D. rats were subjected
to a choline-deficient diet for 14 days prior to experimentation
(see Methods). At the time of MCAO, the animals
(>260 g) were divided into two groups: control (DMSO only)
and treated (PNU-120596, 1 mg·kg−1, i.v., 30 min post-
MCAO). Other experimental details and data analysis were
identical to those used in choline-sufficient animals (see
above and Methods). In choline-deficient animals, PNU-
120596 remained effective and produced significant (P =
0.0343; unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t-test) reduction in
the MCAO-induced infarct volume in treated (n = 4) vs. 
control (n = 4) animals (Figure 7).
Evaluation of blood/brain levels
of PNU-120596
To confirm the presence of PNU-120596 in the brain tissue
and blood plasma, samples of blood plasma and hippocampal
, frontal cortical and striatal tissues of five animals (S.-D.
rats, ∼280 g) subjected to a protocol utilizing 3 h pre-MCAO
were evaluated using MS (see Methods). The results of MS
analyses demonstrated that the amount of PNU-120596 in
the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum collected 3 h
after s.c. injections of 30 mg·kg−1 PNU-120596 in S.-D. rats
were comparable (in ng per g of tissue): 189.5 ± 67.8 (n = 5),
157.5 ± 49.0 (n = 5) and 149.0 ± 42.7 (n = 5), respectively, and
somewhat higher than the amounts of PNU-120596 remaining
in the blood plasma of injected animals (in nM): 63.4 ±
19.3 (n = 5). These values are comparable to those reported
previously (McLean et al., 2011) as well as the concentrations
(i.e. 1 μM) used in our ex vivo experiments (Figures 1–4).
These results suggest that sub-μM to low-μM concentrations
of PNU-120596 and the corresponding doses of systemically
administrated PNU-120596 significantly enhance neuronal
survival in ischaemic injury.

Discussion
A deficient blood supply to the whole brain, as in global
ischaemia, and specific cortical and subcortical brain regions,
as in focal ischaemia, may irreversibly damage brain tissues
and cause a partial or complete loss of cognitive, autonomic
and motor functions. Although in the last two decades, substantial
efforts have been invested in developing neuroprotective
medicine, these efforts have not resulted in clinically
efficacious therapies for ischaemic stroke (Roger et al., 2012).
These failures highlight the need for development of new
therapeutic concepts, approaches and drug treatments for
neuronal protection and prevention of neuronal damage secondary
to ischaemic stroke. The results of this proof-ofconcept
study support the hypothesis that PAMs-II, such as
PNU-120596, can convert endogenous agonists of α7 nAChRs
(i.e. choline and ACh) into potent neuroprotective agents in
post-ischaemic neuronal injury in cortical and subcortical
brain regions. The proposed strategy incorporates the neuroprotective
capacity of α7 nAChR activation by endogenous
choline/ACh enhanced by PNU-120596 (Hurst et al., 2005;
Gusev and Uteshev, 2010).
α7 nAChRs are commonly expressed in the brain including
the hippocampus, cortex and striatum (Breeseet al., 1997;
Whiteaker et al., 1999; Quik et al., 2009; Woodruff et al.,
2011) – brain regions that are selectively vulnerable to ischae-

respectively. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, brain sections were prepared for analysis of infarct volume within cortical and subcortical brain

resistance to ischaemic and other types of insults (Meyer
et al., 1998; Shimohama et al., 1998; Li et al., 1999; Rosa et al.,

choline is a full selective endogenous α7 nAChR agonist, at
physiological levels (i.e. <20 μM) and pathophysiological
levels expected in the penumbra of brain injury sites (i.e.
>20 μM), choline alone is ineffective as an α7 nAChR agonist

Klein et al., 1993, 1998; Sarter and Parikh, 2005; Scremin and

PNU-120596 administered s.c. 24 h prior to focal cerebral ischaemia
failed to enhance resistance of cortical/subcortical brain regions to
ischaemic injury. To test the hypothesis that PNU-120596 preconditions
cortical and subcortical brain regions by enhancing neuronal
resistance to ischaemia, PNU-120596 was injected s.c. 24 h prior to
MCAO. The half-life time of PNU-120596 is ∼8 h (McLean et al.,
2011). It was expected that PNU-120596 preconditions neurons and
thus, its presence is not required at the time of ischaemic injury (i.e.
24 h after PNU-120596 injection). However, the effects of 24 h pre-
MCAO s.c. treatment with PNU-120596 were found to be statistically
insignificant (unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t-test) suggesting that
the presence of PNU-120596 and thus, the enhanced activation of
α7 nAChRs around the time of ischaemic injury are required for
enhanced resistance to ischaemic injury.

tendency to induce α7 desensitization (IC
50
∼40 μM) (Uteshev
et al., 2003). As a result, choline has not previously garnered
much attention as a potential neuroprotective agent.
However, these limitations may be overcome by the use of
PAMs-II, such as previously reported PNU-120596 (Hurst
et al., 2005). PNU-120596 inhibits α7 desensitization and
thus, can produce a persistent and tunable activation modality
of α7 nAChRs (Gusev and Uteshev, 2010; Kalappa et al.,
2010), which may be fine-tuned and optimized to achieve
neuroprotection (Li et al., 1999; Papke et al., 2000; Uteshev
et al., 2003; Uteshev, 2012a,b). Activation of α7 nAChRs can
also be achieved by exogenous α7 agonists (e.g. DMXBA;
Kem, 2000) or inhibitors of ACh hydrolysis (e.g. donepezil;
Kawakami et al., 1996). However, neuroprotection produced
by endogenous nicotinic agonists recruited by a PAM-II may
be more efficacious and with fewer adverse effects (Lo, 2008;
Uteshev, 2012a) because choline is well tolerated and ubiquitously
present in the brain, while PNU-120596 (the first
PAM-II available on the market) is highly selective for α7
nAChRs and to date, non-α7-mediated effects of PNU-120596
have not been reported. Therefore, this study tested the
hypothesis that PNU-120596 enhances survival of neurons
subjected to complete oxygen-glucose deprivation (ex vivo)
and focal cerebral ischaemia (in vivo). The rationale for this
study was that because activation and desensitization of α7
nAChRs are delicately balanced, the proposed study provided
an important proof-of-concept for the development and
future clinical trials of PAMs-II, such as PNU-120596 or other
functionally related compounds (Faghih et al., 2009; Dinklo
et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2011; Freitas et al., 2012; Parada
et al., 2013). These factors highlight the main advantage of
the PAM-II-based neuroprotective paradigm – the ability of
PAMs-II to recruit endogenous choline as a well-tolerated
neuroprotective agent ubiquitously present in the extracellular
fluid. Although endogenous ambient ACh, along with
choline, may also contribute to activation of α7 nAChRs and
neuroprotection in the presence of PNU-120596, the extracellular
levels of ACh in vivo are extremely low (<10 nM) due
to ACh hydrolysis (Hartmann et al., 2008) and thus, potential
neuroprotective effects of ACh in vivo would be expected to
arise primarily from synaptic release of ACh. However, PNU-
120596 alone did not significantly delay COGD-induced neuronal
injury ex vivo (Figure 2F) suggesting that at least in
acute hippocampal slices, the potential contribution of synaptic
ACh to neuroprotection is limited, if any.
The results of ex vivo experiments support the need
for activation of α7 ion channels as a requirement for
α7-mediated enhanced neuroprotection in COGD. This is
evidenced by the inhibitory effects of 20 nM MLA on the
effects of choline + PNU-120596 (Figure 2C) and the lack of
effects by 20 μM choline alone (Figure 2E), 200 μM choline
alone (Figure 3) and 1 μM PNU-120596 alone (Figure 2F). By
inhibiting α7 nAChR desensitization and enhancing the
potency of choline/ACh for α7 activation, PNU-120596 and
other PAMs-II allow endogenous choline/ACh to produce a
weak persistent level of α7 activation (Gusev and Uteshev,
2010; Kalappa et al., 2010; Uteshev, 2012b) – an activation
modality of α7 nAChRs that can be neuroprotective as
discussed in this and other studies (Meyer et al., 1998;
Shimohama et al., 1998; Li et al., 1999; Rosa et al., 2006).
However, the involvement of α7 nAChR-mediated ion channels
in the effects of choline + PNU-120596 introduces concerns
for neurotoxicity because α7 channels are highly
permeable to Ca2+ ions (Vernino et al., 1992; Castro and
Albuquerque, 1995; Fucile, 2004; Uteshev, 2010) and thus,
excessive activation of α7 nAChRs, especially in the presence
of PNU-120596, can become toxic for α7-expressing cells, as
previously discussed (Li et al., 1999; Del Barrio et al., 2011;
Dinklo et al., 2011; Uteshev, 2012a). Despite these valid concerns
, our ex vivo data demonstrate that neurotoxicity does
not result from synergistic action of physiologically relevant
20 μM choline in the presence of 1 μM PNU-120596
(Figure 2A). On the contrary, activation of α7 nAChRs by
20 μM choline + 1 μM PNU-120596 significantly delayed
COGD-induced depolarization/injury of CA1 pyramidal
neurons ex vivo (Figure 2B). These results are further supported
by data obtained in vivo (Figures 5–7). Moreover, the
neuroprotective effects of choline + PNU-120596 are found to
be remarkably resilient and somewhat insensitive to the
extracellular levels of choline because a 10-fold increase in
the choline concentration (i.e. from 20 μM to 200 μM) did
not significantly alter the effects of choline + PNU-120596 on
injury curves (Figure 3). In addition, the neuroprotective
effects of PNU-120596 remained significant in cholinedeficient
rats (Figure 7). These findings may translate into an
enhanced safety and a high therapeutic index of potential
PAM-II-based therapies. These properties may allow PAM-II-
based therapies to remain effective even under conditions
of a highly variable dietary choline intake. Although the
molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection by choline + PNU-
120596 are currently not known, the Ca2+-dependent and/or
-independent JAK2/PI3K/AKT-dependent pathways are likely
candidates (Thomsen et al., 2010; Del Barrio et al., 2011) and
these and other possible mechanisms will be investigated in
our future studies.
The MS analysis of the amounts of PNU-120596 in blood/
brain samples demonstrated that PNU-120596 concentrations
(sub- to low-μM) achieved and used in our in vivoand ex
vivo studies were comparable and similar to those reported in
similar previous studies (McLean et al., 2011). Therefore, it is
conceivable that significant neuroprotection after ischaemic
insults and the corresponding mechanisms engaged by PNU-
120596 in our ex vivo and in vivo experiments were driven
by similar cellular and molecular mechanisms. However,
although α7-expressing neurons are the main focus of this
study, α7 nAChRs are expressed in a broad variety of nonneuronal
tissues including glia (Sharma and Vijayaraghavan,
2001; Parada et al., 2013; Shytle et al., 2004) and immune
cells (Wang et al., 2003; De Rosa et al., 2009). Thus, the significant
reduction of the infarct volume observed in our in
vivo experiments may have resulted from a combined net
effect of α7 nAChR activation in multiple neuronal and nonneuronal
tissues. The impact and contributions of these individual
sources of brain protection remain unknown and
present a great interest.
The results of our in vivo experiments suggest that pretreatment
with PNU-120596 does not produce a true longterm
preconditioning: that is, neuroprotection does not
remain after PNU-120596 is cleared from the system; because
neuroprotection by PNU-120596 was significant only in the
3 h pre-MCAO protocol, but not the 24 h pre-MCAO protocol
with PNU-120596 (30 mg·kg−1; s.c.) treatments. This is con-

sistent with ∼8 h half-life time of PNU-120596 reported previously
(McLean et al., 2011). Therefore, the brain does not
appear to possess a long-term memory for neuroprotective
effects of PNU-120596 and thus, a true preconditioning is
ineffective and the presence of PNU-120596 appears to be
required for significant neuroprotection.
The chance of neuronal survival after a toxic insult is
determined by the neuronal susceptibility to injuries and
neuronal sensitivity to therapeutic treatments. In this study,
we used an electrophysiological cell injury assay and the
COGD protocol to model conditions that are likely present
in the core of the ischaemic injury where neuronal
depolarization/injury and death can be delayed, but not
eliminated (Lo, 2008). The effects of choline + PNU-120596 in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and CA1 stratum radiatum
interneurons then have been compared. While highly
effective in CA1 pyramidal neurons, 20 μM choline + 1 μM
PNU-120596 failed to delay COGD-induced depolarization/
injury of CA1 interneurons (Figure 2D). At least two factors
may have contributed to these differences. CA1 interneurons
express ∼20-fold greater densities of α7 nAChRs than CA1
pyramidal neurons (Kalappa et al., 2010). Thus, concentrations
of choline + PNU-120596 that produce only a weak α7
activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons would be expected to
produce a ∼20-fold greater level of activity in CA1 interneurons.
These levels of activation may be excessive and thus,
suboptimal and ineffective. However, a 10-fold increase in
choline concentration from 20 μMto200μM did not produce
any harm (Figure 3) suggesting that the beneficial effects of
choline + PNU-120596 span over a wide range of choline
concentrations and the level of α7 activation may not
be the prime reason for the observed differences in
the effects of choline + PNU-120596 in CA1 pyramidal
and interneurons. Moreover, COGD-induced depolarization/
injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons remained significantly
delayed by choline + PNU-120596 in the presence of 20 μM
GBZ (Figure 4). Therefore, GABAergic neurotransmission in
the CA1 pyramidal region does not significantly contribute to
neuroprotection by choline + PNU-120596 in COGD ex vivo.
Another possibility is that CA1 interneurons may be intrinsically
more susceptible to acute injury resulted from COGD
making choline + PNU-120596 ineffective. This possibility is
supported by our data. Indeed, CA1 interneurons are significantly
more susceptible to acute injury by COGD than CA1
pyramidal neurons in the presence (Figure 2C) and absence of
PNU-120596 (see Results). These results may seem somewhat
contradictory to the results reported in some previous studies
where hippocampal CA1 interneurons were found less vulnerable
to ischaemic insults than hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons (Ferrer et al., 1995; Freund and Buzsaki, 1996; Frahm
et al., 2004; Avignone et al., 2005; Zhan et al., 2006; Zhan
et al., 2007). However, these conclusions were made in
relation to delayed (i.e. hours) neuronal injury/death after
transient ischaemia, not acute injury/death by COGD investigated
in ex vivo experiments of this study. Nevertheless, the
available data suggest that PAM-II-based neuroprotective
protocols may need to be optimized and individualized for
specific ischaemic insults, neuronal sub-types and brain subregions
reflecting differences in the levels of α7 nAChR
expression and the intrinsic neuronal susceptibility to specific
ischaemic insults and injuries.
The potential clinical utility of PAMs-II may extend to
certain genetic, age- and trauma-related neurodegenerative,
sensorimotor and psychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive
decline and attention deficits (e.g. schizophrenia,
dementia and traumatic brain injury) since these pathologies
are also associated with decreased cholinergic tone and a
decrease, but not total disappearance, of functional α7
nAChRs (Guan et al., 2000; Olincy et al., 2006; Kelso and
Pauly, 2011). Thus, in addition to providing neuroprotective
effects, PAMs-II are expected to be able to improve cognitive
function and attention impairments in patients and animal
models by increasing and partially restoring cholinergic tone
(Kem, 2000; Olincy et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2007; Guseva et al.,
2008; Bitner et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2010). In this regard,
treatments with PNU-120596 or functionally similar compounds
may benefit individuals with ischaemic stroke and
certain age- and trauma-related cognitive deficits via multiple
mechanisms and routes of action.
