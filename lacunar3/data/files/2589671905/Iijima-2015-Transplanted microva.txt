Abstract
We previously showed that transplantation of brain
microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) greatly stimulated
remyelination in the white matter infarct of the internal
capsule (IC) induced by endothelin-1 injection and improved
the behavioral outcome. In the present study, we examined
the effect of MVEC transplantation on the infarct volume
using intermittent magnetic resonance image and on the
behavior of oligodendrocyte lineage cells histochemically.
Our results in vivo show that MVEC transplantation reduced
the infarct volume in IC and apoptotic death of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs). These results indicate that
MVECs have a survival effect on OPCs, and this effect
might contribute to the recovery of the white matter infarct.
The conditioned-medium from cultured MVECs reduced
apoptosis of cultured OPCs, while the conditioned medium
from cultured fibroblasts did not show such effect. These
results suggest a possibility that transplanted MVECs
increased the number of OPCs through the release of
humoral factors that prevent their apoptotic death. Identification
of such humoral factors may lead to the new
therapeutic strategy against ischemic demyelinating diseases.

Ischemic demyelination is a result of either subcortical white
matter stroke, which accounts for 15–25% of all stroke
subtypes (Bamford et al. 1991), or of cerebral small vessel
disease, which has become more common as the population
ages, and has no specific treatment (Nitkunan et al. 2008;
Conijn et al. 2011; Khalilzada et al. 2011; Wardlaw et al.
2013). We have been investigating the cell–cell interaction
between brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and
neuralcellstodeveloptherapeuticsforischemicdemyelinating
diseases. This cell–cell interaction is known as the neurovascular
unit and is important in homeostasis and repair of the
brain. Studies to analyze the cell–cell interaction between
MVECs and neural cells have mainly been performedin vitro,

and in vivo studies could not exclude the effect of increased
blood flow (Muramatsu et al. 2012; Ishikawa et al. 2013).
Some studies reported that angiogenesis promotes neurogenesis
or lesion volume reduction (Hayashi et al. 1998; Zhang
et al. 2000; Louissaint et al. 2002; Sun et al. 2010; Uemura
et al. 2012), whereas other studies revealed that revascularization
of established brain ischemic lesions does not improve
the outcome for patients (Hackeet al.2008; Sandercocket al.
2012). Our previous study showed that the volume of ischemic
demyelinating lesions decreased in the absence of increased
vascularization after transplantation of MVECs (Puenteset al.
2012), suggesting that the direct cell–cell interaction between
MVECs and neural cells is important in this therapeutic effect.
In the present study, MVECs prepared from rat cerebral
cortex were transplanted into an endothelin-1 (ET-1)-
induced demyelinating lesion (infarct), and changes in the
infarct volume and in the behavior of oligodendrocyte (OL)
lineage cells were investigated. Transplanted MVECs
reduced the ischemic white matter infarct volume, increased
the number of OL lineage cells without promoting their
proliferation, and inhibited the apoptotic death of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs) in ischemic demyelinating
lesions. The cell–cell interaction between MVECs and OL
lineage cells is called the oligovascular niche, and may be
important in the survival of OPCs (Arai and Lo 2009).
These findings may be helpful for developing new therapeutic
tools against ischemic demyelinating diseases. In this
study, we used bovine serum albumin (BSA) as control,
because we confirmed that transplantation of meningeal
cells, another cell type, had no therapeutic effects on
ischemic white matter damage in our previous study
(Puentes et al. 2012).
Materials and methods
Animals
We used adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (weighing 200–
250 g at the beginning of experiments; Harlan Sprague Dawley,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). All procedures were performed in accordance
with the guidelines for Animal Experimentation at Gunma
University Graduate School of Medicine and were approved by
Gunma University Ethics Committee. These procedures were also in
accordance with EC Directive 86/609/EEC and the Uniform
Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals.
All surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions,
and every effort was made to minimize animal suffering and to
reduce the number of animals used.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was carried out on day 7 after
ET-1 injection before MVEC transplantation or vehicle injection,
and on day 21 by a 1-T benchtop MR scanner (Icon; Bruker Biospin
GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) (Schmid et al. 2013). Anesthesia was
induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.5% isoflurane
(in room air). Respiration rates were monitored throughout the
procedure, and body temperature was maintained at 37°C. A rapid
acquisition relaxation enhancement, low resolution T2-weighted
sequence was used to determine the precise lesion location: rapidacquisition
relaxation enhancement factor 5, repetition time
2500 ms, echo time 60 ms with in-plane resolution of
2669 266 lm2, thickness 1250 lm, and 9 slices. A second
high-resolution T2-weighted imaging set was acquired throughout
the lesion: rapid-acquisition relaxation enhancement factor 10,
repetition time 2500 ms, echo time 80 ms with in-plane resolution
of 1439 143 lm2, thickness 1000 lm, and 10 contiguous slices.
The lesion and the internal capsule (IC) were manually delineated
from the high-resolution MR images and the lesion volume in the IC
was calculated. T2*-weighted sequence was used to detect ironlabeled
MVECs: Fast low angle shot, repetition time 800 ms, echo
time 20 ms with in-plane resolution of 2669 266 lm2, thickness
1250 lm, and 9 slices.
Cell culture
MVECs were prepared from the cerebra of green rats [SD-Tg(CAGEGFP
)] (for transplantation) or wild-type rats (for preparation of
conditioned medium, CM) according to Puentes et al. (2012) and
Szab oet al.(1997). For iron labeling, we used Ferumoxides (Feridex;
Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) according to Arbabet al.(2005) with
some modifications. Protamine sulfate was added to MVEC culture
medium (Puentes et al.2012) containing 50 mg/mL Ferumoxides to
the concentration of 5 mg/mL. After mixing by intermittent manual
shaking for 3–5 min, we replaced the medium of MVEC culture by
this mixture. The cells were then incubated overnight, and washed
with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then with PBS-
containing heparin (10 U/mL) to dissolve extracellular Ferumoxides–
protamine complexes before harvesting for transplantation.
OPCs were prepared from the cerebra of SD rats (postnatal
days 1–2). The cortical tissue was digested with 16.5 U/mL
papain solution, triturated, and centrifuged. The pellet was
suspended in the panning buffer (5 lg/mL insulin, 0.02% BSA
in Hank’s balanced salt solution, HBSS). Dissociated cells were
immunopanned on anti-RAN-2, anti-galactocerebroside, and O4
antibody-coated plates. OPCs isolated as O4-positive cells were
suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-F12
containing 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 5 lg/mL insulin, 100 lg/mL apotransferrin,
100 lg/mL BSA, 62 ng/mL progesterone, 16 lg/mL putrescine,
40 ng/mL sodium selenite, and 30 lM N-acetyl cysteine (DMEMF12
/SATO). The cells were plated into poly-D-lysine-coated tissue
culture dish, and grown in DMEM-F12/SATO medium containing
forskolin, ciliary neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and plateletderived
growth factor (PDGF)-AA. After several days, OPCs
were harvested from the dish, using TrypLE Express (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), washed, and suspended in the culture
medium. OPCs were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 8-well glass
slides at the density of 12 000 cells/cm2.
Rat fibroblast-like cells (Rat-1) were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum on collagen type I-coated dish.
Stereotactic ET-1 injection and cell transplantation
ET-1 injection was performed as previously described with some
modifications (Puentes et al. 2012). SD rats (8-week-old) were
anesthetized and placed in a stereotactic frame. The posterior limb

of the IC was targeted for injection (2.3 mm posterior and
6.1 mm lateral left to the bregma, 3.7 mm depth, angle 25˚). One
microliter of ET-1 solution (200 pmol/lL, peptide) was injected
at a constant flow rate (0.5 lL/min). Seven days after ET-1
injection, when the ischemic injury had been established, 2 lL of 
the cell suspensions (MVECs suspended in 0.2% BSA–HBSS) at
the density of 49 104 cells/lL or 0.2% BSA–HBSS was injected
into each animal using the coordinates used for ET-1 injection.
Cryosection
Cryosection was performed as previously described with some
modifications (Puentes et al. 2012). The animals were anesthetized
with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with saline solution
containing 10 U/mL heparin, followed by 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was immediately
dissected, postfixed 60 min in the same fixative at 4°C,
cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and
finally frozen with optimal cutting temperature compound. Frozen
coronal sections (20 lm in thickness, 120 serial slices per brain) were
cut on a cryostat (CM3050S; Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany),
mounted on pre-coated glass slides (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan), and
placed at 23C for 1 h to air dry. The sections were stored at80°C
until staining.
Immunostaining for NG2, MBP, CC1, ED-1, PDGFRa and
neurofilament proteins
Primary antibodies for immunostaining included mouse monoclonal
antibodies directed against CC1 (1 : 400; EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), SMI31 (recognizing phosphorylated neurofilament (NF)
heavy chain, 1 : 1000; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), ED-1
(1 : 100; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, Oxfordshire, UK) and SMI94
[recognizing myelin basic protein (MBP), 1 : 400; BioLegend]; and
rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against NG2 and plateletderived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR)a (1 : 200; EMD Millipore
). Sections were air-dried at 23C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
, incubated with 2% BSA in PBS containing 10% normal
donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (or without detergent for NG2
antigen) for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBS, sections were
incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies: rhodamine-conjugated
donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
, West Grove, PA, USA) for SMI94; rhodamine-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for NG2, when costained
with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL); Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antirabbit
Ig (Invitrogen) for NG2, when co-stained for MBP; Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Invitrogen) for
PDGFRa; and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig
(Invitrogen) for CC1 and SMI31. We used a tertiary antibody, Alexa
Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat Ig (Invitrogen), when NG2
was co-stained with TUNEL. Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA) was used for nuclear staining. Sections were
examined using a fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka,
Japan).
Immunostaining for Ki67 and Olig2
The brain sections were air-dried at 23C, washed with PBS
followed by distilled water, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was performed at 120°C for 20 min in
trisodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). The sections were then
incubated in 3% H
2
O
2
in PBS for 10 min, and followed in Tris-
NaCl-blocking (TNB) buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl)
containing 0.5% Blocking reagent (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) before incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 antibody
(1 : 400; BD-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) and rabbit
polyclonal anti-Olig2 antibody (1 : 200; IBL, Takasaki, Japan)
diluted in TNB buffer overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS,
the sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse
antibody (1 : 1500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and rhodamineconjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibody (1 : 100) for 120 min, washed
again in PBS, and then incubated with Streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase (1 : 1500; PerkinElmer) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
donkey anti-goat antibody (1 : 500) for 120 min. The Ki67
signal was enhanced, using Tyramide Signal Amplification methods
(TSA Plus Fluorescein Evaluation Kit; PerkinElmer). Hoechst
33342 was used for nuclear staining.
Double labeling for TUNEL and NG2
TUNEL staining was performed using the TACS2 TdT-Fluor In
Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing
sections in distilled water, Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(diluted 1 : 300 in PBS) was applied to each section for 1 h at
23C. The positive reaction was detected using Tyramide Signal
Amplification methods. After TUNEL staining, the sections were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, incubated with 2%
BSA-PBS containing 10% donkey serum for 30 min, and then
incubated in anti-NG2 antibody (1 : 200) overnight at 4°C. After
washing with PBS, sections were incubated with rhodamineconjugated
goat anti-rabbit antibody for 120 min, and then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat
antibody. Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear staining.
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed as previously described
(Shibasaki et al. 2007). Briefly, digoxigenin-labeled antisense/sense
probes were used for in situ hybridization of proteolipid protein
(PLP). The 1.4 kb fragment of mouse PLP1 cDNA was subcloned
into pSPT18 by BamHI and EcoRI sites (Dr. K. Ikenaka kindly
provided us this vector (Ivanova et al. 2003).). The cDNA fragment
has high homology against rat PLP1. After we linearized the
plasmid (antisense: BamHI, sense: EcoRI), the digoxigenin-labeled
antisense/sense probes were synthesized by RNA polymerase
(antisense: T7 RNA polymerase, sense: SP6 RNA polymerase).
Detection of mRNA on cryo-sectioned tissues was performed by
nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
through an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Conditioned media and OPC survival assay
To prepare conditioned media, we used MVECs (90–95% confluence
) and Rat-1 cells (60–70% confluence) grown in DMEM-F12/
SATO medium for 48 h. Conditioned media were collected, and
centrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatant was filtered with
a 0.45 lm filter and used without dilution. OPCs plated on 8-well
glass slides were washed with PBS, and then cultured in conditioned

media from MVECs (MVEC-CM) or Rat-1 cells (Rat-1-CM). As
control, OPCs were cultured in DMEM-F12/SATO medium. After
2 days, OPCs were vitally stained with Hoechst 33342. All cells
(both pyknotic and non-pyknotic) were counted and the fraction of
pyknotic cells was determined.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean SE of the mean. For analysis of
lesion volume on MR imaging and pyknotic nuclear ratio of OPCs,
differences between groups were analyzed with one-way analyses of
variance followed by the post hoc Tukey–Kramer test. For analyses
of cell density of OPCs, OL lineage cells as well as immature and
mature OLs, TUNEL positive ratio of OPCs, and proliferation ratio
of OL lineage cells, differences between groups were examined by
Student’s t-test. Cell counting was performed by researchers
unaware of the profile of the animals.
Results
Change in the infarct volume revealed by MR imaging
Although we reported that MVEC transplantation ameliorated
ischemic damage in IC, we did not follow the change
in the infarct volume in IC of the same animals, as we
evaluated ischemic damage histochemically and had to
sacrifice animals at each time point (Puentes et al. 2012).
To confirm the therapeutic effect of MVEC transplantation
in the same animals, we used MR imaging. At first we
examined whether our MVEC transplantation into IC was
successful or not by MR imaging (Fig. 1a). To visualize
MVECs, we labeled cultured MVECs with iron before
transplanting them into IC. The MR imaging revealed the
presence of MVECs 7 days after transplantation, showing
that our transplantation was successful. MVECs appeared to
remain in the transplanted site as a lump, confirming our
previous observation that only a few of the transplanted
MVECs were incorporated into host vasculatures (see Fig. 6
in Puentes et al. 2012). We then quantified the infarct
volume in IC using MR imaging. The size of the
histological demyelinating lesion revealed by luxol fast
blue (LFB) staining correlated with the infarct size calculated
by T2-weighted MR Imaging (Fig. 1b and c) as
previously reported (Lecrux et al. 2008). Representative
MR images of each group in our experimental schedules
(Fig. 2a) are shown in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 2, ‘No treatment’

means animals receiving ET-1 injection on day 0 and no
treatment thereafter. At day 7, no significant difference was
found in the volume of the infarct in IC between each
group (Fig. 2c). The percentage of the infarct volume in IC
at day 21 relative to that of day 7 was significantly smaller
in the MVEC-transplanted group compared to control
groups treated with BSA, or untreated (Fig. 2d). Remyelination
was observed in the region where transplanted
MVEC had no direct contact with the lesion (data not
shown), confirming our previous results (see Fig. 5b in
Puentes et al. 2012). This suggests that the transplanted
MVEC might release some humoral factors to induce
remyelination. In our previous histochemical study, we
examined the infarct volume at only one time point in each
animal (Puentes et al. 2012). Using MR imaging, however
, we succeeded in confirming that MVEC
transplantation reduces the infarct volume in the same
animal by day 21.
Axons were preserved in ET-1-induced demyelinating lesion
To evaluate whether the axons indispensable for remyelination
were preserved in ET-1-induced lesion in the IC, we
examined the axons in ET-1-treated IC using immunostaining
for neurofilament proteins. Demyelinating lesions were
identified with a bright field microscope (Figure S1, left
column). In Figure S1, ‘Intact IC’ means the IC that received
no intervention at all. Immunohistochemical staining for
neurofilament proteins revealed the profiles of the axons
(Figure S1, right column). Presence of axons was confirmed
in the lesion in IC at day 7 (data not shown), and in the
lesions of animals treated with MVECs or BSA at day 14
(Figure S1b and c). There was no apparent difference in the
density of axons in IC between three groups (intact, MVEC-
treated, or BSA-treated) at day 14 (Figure S1). These results
suggest that axons were preserved in the ET-1-induced
demyelinating lesions.
MVECs increased OPCs in the lesion
To elucidate the cellular mechanism whereby MVEC
transplantation promotes remyelination in the lesion, we
focused on OPCs, because they play an important role in
remyelinating process in other demyelinating diseases like

multiple sclerosis (Miron et al. 2011). We initially assessed
the distribution of OPCs in and around the lesion in IC.
Brain sections were immumostained with antibodies against
NG2, a marker for OPCs, and MBP, a marker for myelin
(Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, ‘Intact IC’ means the IC that received no
intervention at all. Immunohistochemical staining for NG2
revealed the presence of OPCs in the brain. NG2 expression
in vivo has also been detected in microglia/macrophages
(Jones et al. 2002) and pericytes (Dore-Duffy et al. 2006).
We confirmed, however, that NG2-positive cells did not
co-express ED-1, a marker for microglia/macrophages, in
our experiments (Figure S2). We observed that pericytes also
express NG2 in our experiments. They were, however, easily
distinguished from OPCs, as they were always localized
within vasculatures and displayed different morphology. In
ET-1-injected IC, MBP signal was remarkably reduced,
confirming demyelination in the lesion (Fig. 3c). To ask
whether the cell density of OPCs in the lesion changed with
time after ET-1 injection and MVEC transplantation, we
counted the number of OPCs (NG2-positive cells) and
estimated their cell densities in the normal IC, in the lesions
in IC of ET-1-treated animals at day 7, and in the lesions in
IC of ET-1-injected animals that received MVECs or BSA
(on day 7) at days 10, 14, and 21. The density of OPCs
significantly increased in the lesion in IC at day 7 compared

increased up to day 14 and then decreased down to day 21,
whereas the density in the lesion in IC of BSA-treated
animals decreased in comparison to day 7. The densities of
OPCs in the lesion in the IC were significantly higher in
MVEC-treated animals compared to BSA-treated animals at
days 10, 14, and 21 (Fig. 3c and d). At days 14 and 21, MBP
staining showed higher remyelination in the MVEC-treated
IC compared to the BSA-treated IC (Fig. 3c and e). These
results indicate that MVEC transplantation induced not only
enhanced myelination as previously reported (Puentes et al.
2012), but also exhibited an increase in the density of OPCs
in the lesion.
MVECs did not stimulate OPC proliferation
To ask whether an increase in the density of OPCs in the
lesion in MVEC-treated animals was caused by their
proliferation, we analyzed proliferative OL lineage cells
using antibodies against Olig2, a marker for OL lineage cells,
and Ki67, a marker for proliferative cells. Olig2/Ki67 double
positive cells can be regarded as OPCs, because OLs, both
immature and mature, have exited the cell cycle and thus
non-proliferative (Nishiyama et al. 2009). Immunohistochemical
staining for Olig2 revealed that the density of OL
lineage cells was significantly lower in the lesion in the IC at
day 7 compared to the intact IC (Fig. 4c). Cell densities of
OL lineage cells were significantly higher in MVEC-treated
animals compared to BSA-treated animals at days 10, 14, and
21 (Fig. 4c). Moreover, OL lineage cells increased gradually
from days 10 to 21 in MVEC-treated animals (Fig. 4c).
Double immunostaining for Olig2 and Ki67 revealed that
proliferation of OL lineage cells in the lesion in IC was not
significantly higher in MVEC-treated animals compared to
BSA-treated animals at days 10, 14, and 21 (Fig. 4b and d).
These results suggest that MVEC transplantation does not
stimulate proliferation of OPCs in the lesion.

Transplanted MVECs promote OPC survival in vivo 545
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
MVECs promoted OPC survival
We examined survival of OPCs using TUNEL assay
combined with NG2 immunostaining. At day 7, about 16%
of OPCs in the demyelinating lesions were apoptotic (Fig. 5a
and d). Representative images of TUNEL and NG2 staining
at day 10 are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). The percentage of
TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) OPCs (NG2-positive cells) in
the lesion in IC was significantly smaller in MVEC-treated
animals than that in BSA-treated animals at days 10 and 14
(Fig. 5d). These results indicate that MVEC transplantation
promoted OPC survival in the infarct in IC.
MVECs increased immature OLs but not mature OLs
We then examined whether MVEC transplantation increased
mature OLs in the lesion in IC by in situ hybridization for
PLP mRNA, a marker for mature OLs, and immunostaining
for CC1 – a marker for both immature and mature OLs – as
increased myelination might be because of an increase in
mature OLs. Contrary to our expectation, in situ hybridization
for PLP mRNA revealed that there was no difference in
the density of PLP-positive mature OLs between MVEC- and
BSA-treated animals at days 14 and 21 (Figure S3a and c).
By contrast, immunostaining for CC1 revealed that the
density of CC1-positive cells was significantly higher in
MVEC-treated animals compared to BSA-treated animals at
day 14 (Figure S3b and d). These results suggest that
enhanced myelination at day 21 is not the result of the
increase in myelinating OLs.
MVECs promoted survival of OPCs in vitro
To help clarify the mechanism by which MVECs promote
survival of OPCs, we examined the effect of CM from
MVEC cultures on OPC survival in vitro. OPCs were
cultured with conditioned media from MVEC culture
(MVEC-CM) or from Rat-1 culture (Rat-1-CM), or with
the basal medium. After 2 days, cell death was assessed by
staining nuclei with Hoechst 33342. In the presence of
MVEC-CM, pyknotic OPCs were significantly fewer than
those in the presence of Rat-1-CM or the basal medium
(control), suggesting a possibility that humoral factors
secreted from MVECs promote survival of OPCs in our
ET-1-induced demyelinating lesion (Fig. 6a and b). As
shown in Fig. 6(c), MVEC-CM per se apparently did not
promote maturation of OPCs, judging from their morphology
and PDGFRa expression, as OPCs cease PDGFRa expression
once they differentiate into OLs (Nishiyama et al.
2009).

ischemic damage to the white matter (Puentes et al. 2012),
following the change in the infarct volume in the same
animal using MR imaging (Fig. 7a and b). In many stroke
studies thus far, including our previous one (Puentes et al.
2012), therapeutic effects were examined histologically, so
that the change in the infarct volume could not be followed in
the same animal but only be estimated from the data gathered
from different animals. Our experimental system using MR
imaging will prove useful for following the time course of
white matter damage in rats or mice.
Gadea et al. (2009) reported that ET-1 produced and
released by astrocytes regulates OL development via ET
receptors expressed by OPCs. So there is a possibility that
injected ET-1 directly affects OL lineage cells. Further
studies are needed to examine this possibility.
The present study indicated that transplantation of MVECs
induces an increase in the number of OPCs in ischemic
demyelinating lesions, and that this increase in OPCs is
mainly caused by inhibition of apoptotic death (Fig. 7c). Our
previous study showed no change in the vascular densities in
IC of MVEC-transplanted animals (Fig. 7a). These findings
suggest that MVEC transplantation promotes survival of
OPCs through the cell–cell interaction in the ischemic
demyelinating lesion, independent of increased angiogenesis
or higher blood flow. Previous studies of the treatment of
ischemic brain lesion by increasing angiogenesis or blood
flow could not distinguish the effect of the direct cell–cell
interaction between MVECs and neural cells from the effect
of increased blood flow (Hayashi et al. 1998; Zhang et al.
2000; Louissaint et al. 2002; Shin et al. 2008; Sun et al.
2010; Uemura et al. 2012). The present study clearly
demonstrated that presence of MVECs per sehas a beneficial
effect on ischemic white matter damage in vivo, independent
of increased angiogenesis. Our study also raises the possibility
that malfunction of endothelial cells induces degeneration
of OL lineage cells and results in demyelination. The
findings of the present study are consistent with the previous
report that OPCs are decreased through the apoptotic
pathway in demyelinating lesions despite maintenance of
the high proliferative rate (Payne et al. 2013) and suggest

that inhibition of the apoptotic death of OPCs is important for
effective therapy of demyelinating diseases. At present, the
molecular mechanism by which MVECs promote OPC
survival remains undetermined. To help clarify this mechanism
, we examined the effect of CM from MVEC culture on
OPC survival in vitro, as the involvement of humoral factors
was suggested in our in vivo studies. CM from MVEC
culture significantly reduced apoptotic death of OPCs
(Fig. 6), suggesting humoral factors released by MVECs
directly contribute to a decrease in the apoptotic death of
OPCs. Previous studies have shown that cytokines released
by infiltrating microglia/macrophages and/or reactive astrocytes
induce apoptotic death of OPCs in demyelinating
lesions (Rhodes et al. 2006; Schonberg et al. 2007; Fitzgerald et al. 2010). Our previous study also revealed that
MVEC transplantation repressed the inflammatory response
in the lesion (Fig. 7a), so there is a possibility that MVECs
reduce apoptotic death of OPCs indirectly by inhibition of
the inflammatory response.
From our in vitro study, MVEC-CM did not apparently
promote maturation of OPCs (Fig. 6c). This did not coincide
with our in vivo result, which revealed an increase in
immature OLs by MVEC transplantation (Figure S3b and d).
The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear at present.
There is a possibility, however, that the humoral factors
responsible for OPC maturation are not recovered at
sufficient concentrations in CM in our experiments.
There is a possibility that an increase in OPCs results in an
increase in myelinating mature OLs, thereby enhancing
remyelination in the lesion. This seems unlikely, however,
because MVEC transplantation increased OPCs and immature
OLs but not mature OLs. From our previous and present
studies, MVEC transplantation increased myelination, judging
from LFB staining and MBP staining (Fig. 5 in Puentes
et al. 2012; and Fig. 3 in this study). MVEC transplantation,
however, did not increase the number of mature OLs (PLP-
positive cells) at days 14 and 21 (Figure S3a and c), while it
increased the number of immature OLs (CC1-positive cells)
at day 14 (Figure S3b and d). This suggests that MVEC
transplantation promotes myelination by existing (intrinsic)
mature OLs without increasing their number (by the end of
our observation period, day 21). At present, it remains
unclear how MVEC transplantation and the resultant increase
in OPCs and immature OLs promote remyelination in the
lesion. Recently Porambo et al. (2015) reported that transplanted
glial restricted precursor cells improve myelination
through trophic effects in addition to differentiation into
mature OLs. This suggests a possibility that increased OPCs
and immature OLs improve myelination by existing mature
OLs through trophic effects. Further studies are needed to
address this point.
We have been examining the effects of vascular endothelial
cells on OL lineage cells and revealed that vascular
endothelial cells exert beneficial effects on OL lineage cells
under pathological conditions. Recently Yuen et al. (2014)
reported that OPCs induce angiogenesis via hypoxiainducible
factor (HIF) signaling during development. Taken
together, there is a possibility that the interactions between
vascular endothelial cells and OL lineage cells play important
roles during development and recovery process under
pathological conditions.
It may not be feasible to apply MVEC transplantation to
the treatment of patients suffering from cerebral infarction.

suggesting increased OPCs and immature OLs improve myelination
by existing (intrinsic) mature OLs through trophic effects.

Our study suggested, however, humoral factors released from
MVECs promote OPC survival and increase their number,
thereby enhancing remyelination in the lesion. Identification
of such humoral factors and better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms by which MVECs inhibit the apoptotic
death of OPCs may lead to the establishment of a
therapeutic strategy against ischemic demyelinating diseases.
