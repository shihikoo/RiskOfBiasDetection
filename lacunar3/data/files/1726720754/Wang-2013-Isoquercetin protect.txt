In the present study, oxygen–glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R), an in vitro model of
ischemia, was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin in primary culture of rat cortical
neuronal cells. It was found that isoquercetin administered prior to the insult could prevent
OGD/R-induced intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]
i
) increase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release and cell viability decrease. For the first time, isoquercetin is described as a neuroprotective agent
that potentially explains the alleviation and prevention from OGD/R-induced injury in neurons. Mechanistic
studies showed that the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin was carried out by anti-inflammatory
signaling pathway of inhibiting protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-jB), and mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-6, accompanied by the anti-apoptotic signaling
pathway of deactivation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun kinase (JNK) and p38, and
inhibition of activity of caspase-3. Therefore, these studies highlighted the confirmation of isoquercetin,
a flavonoid compound, as an anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis factor which might be used as a therapeutic
strategy for the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury and related diseases.

1. Introduction
About 87% of strokes are caused by ischemia, and ischemia has
been the target of most drug trials (Rosamond et al., 2007).
Ischemic stroke was induced by thrombosis, embolism or systemic
hypoperfusion, all of which result in a restriction of blood flow to
the brain, and ischemia results in insufficient oxygen and glucose
delivery to support cellular homeostasis. Brain ischemia induces
numerous deleterious cascades which may lead to cell death:
excitotoxicity, acidotoxicity and ionic imbalance, peri-infarct depolarization
, oxidative and nitrative stress, inflammation and apoptosis
(Gonzalez, 2006; Juan et al., 2012). The current treatment for
complete stroke is only partially successful at reversing neurodegeneration
and restoring premorbid function. Therefore, there is
a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies.
Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which resulted in cerebral
infarction and revascularization after thrombolysis, is the main
cause for the aggravation of cerebral injury and functional impairment.
Excessive formation of free radicals, inflammatory reactions,
overload of calcium inside neurocytes, and the cytotoxic effect of
excitatory amino acids have been proved to be the main causes
contributing to cerebral I/R injury. As the main factor of aggravation
of cerebral injury, acute inflammatory cascade reactions cause
specific activities. There are obvious inflammatory cell aggregations
, up-regulation of cytokines expression, and increased expression
of intercellular adhesion molecules during cerebral I/R injury,
and, what is more, oriented anti-inflammatory therapy has
displayed evident neuroprotective effects on animal models.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were recently shown to participate in the
recognition of endogenous proteins that are released from damaged
tissues after I/R injuries (Kaczorowski et al., 2008). A large
body of evidence suggests that TLRs play a central role in I/R injuries.
For example, it was suggested that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
knockout played a neuroprotective role in ischemic brain injury
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice
(Hyakkoku et al., 2010). I/R injury induces an intense inflammatory
response when a tissue is temporarily deprived of blood supply
and then resupply (Arumugam et al., 2004). Such pathology commonly
occurs in cases of shock, tissue transplantation, myocardial
infarction, stroke, certain infections, arterial disease, and trauma.
Inflammatory responses play a crucial role in cerebral ischemic
injuries and neuronal cell death (Arumugam et al., 2005, 2007;
Ishikawa et al., 2005). TLR4 is a leucine-rich transmembrane protein
, which activates a variety of signal pathways in the cytosol
of immune cells. TLR4 stimulates mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) and stress kinases, such as extracellular-regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2, p38 and Jun kinase (JNK) 1/2, which in turn activate
transcription regulators of inflammation in the nucleus (Schroder
et al., 2001). TLR4 signaling modulates the severity of ischemia-induced
inflammatory response and neuronal damage and has been
demonstrated as a target of stroke therapy (Arumugam et al.,
2009). Activation of TLRs generally leads to nuclear translocation
of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB), a key transcription factor
involved regulating the inducible expression of inflammatory
mediators that lead to an inflammatory response (Kaisho and
Akira, 2006). Inhibition of cerebral NF-jB activation is associated
with neuroprotective effects (Bi et al., 2009; Valerio et al., 2009).
TLR4 and NF-jB signaling pathway has become a research focus
of cerebral ischemic injury, which involved in the inflammatory
response, neurological deficits and neuronal apoptosis (Yang
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore, targeting TLR4 and
NF-jB signaling provides a promising intervention strategy to
reduce damage induced by these pathologies (Khan et al., 2012;
Qin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012).
There are numerous studies on the beneficial effects of polyphenols
from plants and fruits in humans and animals. Quercetin is
present in various plants and particularly abundant in onions and
tea, and exists predominantly in glucoside forms including
isoquercetin (Lakhanpal and Rai, 2007; Scalbert and Williamson,
2000). Isoquercetin possesses many biological properties including
antiviral (Kim et al., 2010), antidiabetic (Zhang et al., 2011a) and
antioxidant effects (Nguyen et al., 2009). Recently, it was reported
that isoquercetin protects neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in vitro
against oxidative damage (Soundararajan et al., 2008). Besides,
its analogue hyperoside, has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective
effects against OGD/R-induced injury (Chen et al., 2006;
Liu et al., 2012). Based on these research, we hypothesize that
isoquercetin possess neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R
injury. Therefore, the present study was decided to investigate
the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin against OGD/R-induced
injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Furthermore,
the possible molecular signaling mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective
effect of isoquercetin was also investigated.

)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased
from Genmed (Westbury, NY). Isoquercetin (purity above
98%) was provided by the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-
Cytotoxic test kit and intracellular calcium concentration assay
kit were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Biotech, China. Alexa
Fluor488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (V13241, Invitrogen)
was used for Flow Cytometry.
2.2. Primary cortical neuronal cultures and experimental treatments
All procedures on animals followed guidelines established by
the Institutional Animal Care Committee and China Council on
Animal Care. Primary culture of rat cortical neurons was prepared
from the brain of Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat embryos at 17–19 days
of gestation (obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of
Nantong University, China). The dissociation and culture method
was followed as described byZhang et al. (2011b), with some modifications.
Briefly, pregnant females were anesthetized with 10%
chloral hydrate (0.4 ml/100 g body weight) and subjected to cesarean
section in order to dissect the fetal brains. The dissected tissues
were minced separately into small pieces and digested with trypsin
(0.125%) for 5 min, before culture medium containing 10%
FBS was added. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation at
500 rpm for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated plates
for 4 h incubation at 37C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air
and 5% CO
2
. After cells attached to the substrate, the medium
was replaced with neuronal culture medium consisting of serumfree
Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5 mM glutamine
, followed by re-incubation for 7–8 days, the time required
for maturation of cortical neurons, with half of the medium being
changed every 2 days. Then, the cells were characterized by immunohistochemistry
for NF200 protein, revealing that the cell cultures
contained above 90% neurons.
2.3. OGD/R application
OGD was performed according to a previously described method
(Liu et al., 2012; Rau et al., 2012). In brief, the culture medium
was removed and cells were washed twice and incubated in DMEM
without glucose. Then, the cultures were introduced into a specialized
, humidified chamber filled with 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
at 37C for
6 h. OGD was terminated by replacing the DMEM without glucose
with Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and the cultures
were further incubated under 95% air and 5% CO
2
for 24 h at
37C (recovery, R). Cells in the control group were treated identically
except that they were not exposed to OGD.

2.4. Drug treatment
The primary culture of rat cortical neurons were pretreated
with 20, 40 and 80lg/ml isoquercetin and 2.5, 5lg/ml nimodipine
, respectively, for 24 h, followed by exposure to OGD for 6 h,
then reperfusion for 24 h. The cortical neurons cultured in plain
medium served as control. At the end of cell treatments, different
tests were carried out as described below.
2.5. Cell viability study
At the end of drug treatment cell viability was evaluated by
measuring cellular MTT reduction. MTT (10ll, 0.5 mg/ml) was
added to each culture well. After incubation at 37C for an
additional 4 h, the formazan crystals were dissolved by addition
of 100ll 20% SDS, and the plates were shaken vigorously to ensure
complete solubilization. Formazan absorbance was assessed at
570 nm by microplate reader.
2.6. LDH release assay
Cell death was determined by the LDH into the media, for LDH
is an indicator for cell injury. Thus, LDH activity in the medium
after OGD/R was determined according to the protocols of the
manufacturer’s to confirm cortical neuron death.
2.7. Measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]
i
)
Intracellular calcium levels were measured by calcium concentration
assay kit (Jiancheng Biochemical Inc.).
2.8. FITC-Annexin V/Propidium iodide (PI) double staining
FITC-Annexin V/PI double stain assay was used to examine
OGD/R-induced cortical neurons apoptosis. We conducted the
assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen).
Briefly, neurons were cultured in 6-well plates (1106 cells per
well) and treated as mentioned previously. Cells were collected
after OGD/R. Then, apoptosis was flow cytometrically assessed
using FITC-Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit.
2.9. Analysis of nuclear morphology
The Hoechst 33342 is sensitive to DNA and was used to assess
the changes in nuclear morphology. In order to visually assess
the effects of isoquercetin on the apoptotic changes in primary
culture of rat cortical neurons after OGD/R, Hoechst 33342 staining
was applied after the treatment of the cells. Briefly, cells grown on
coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed with
freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.01 M PBS for
30 min at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed three
times with PBS. After that, Hoechst 33342 (5lg/ml) was added.
After 15 min, cells were washed three times and mounted in
fluorescent mounting medium and observed under a confocal laser
scanning microscope (TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems, Germany).
2.10. Cell extract preparation and Western blotting
TLR4, NF-rB, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, JNK1/2, p-JNK1/2, p-p38, p38
and cleaved caspase-3 were quantified by Western blotting
analysis as described by a previous study (Zhang et al., 2011b).
Briefly, cortical neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
and then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH = 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na
3
VO
4
, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA,
1% NP40, 50 mM NaF] for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4C. The protein concentration in
samples was determined by BCA analysis. Following addition of
2 loading buffer [100 mM Tris–HCl (pH = 6.8), 4% SDS, 20%
glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) and boiling for 5 min, aliquots
containing 30lg of protein were loaded onto 10% SDS–PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were
blocked with 2.5% non-fat dried milk in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline
–Tween 20 (TBST). They were incubated overnight at 4C with
primary antibodies. The membranes were incubated with the
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Super-Signal West Picotrical Kit) and subsequently quantified by
densitometry. Membranes were probed for GAPDH to normalize
for equal protein loading and transfer.
2.11. Real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR
)
Real-time RT-PCR was employed to evaluate changes in the
mRNA levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in response to OGD/R. Total RNA
was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from primary
culture of rat cortical neurons after OGD/R, which was DNase-treated
and purified by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). Then cDNA was synthesized using an Omniscript RT kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a Stepone Real-Time
PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the
SYBR Green RT-PCR system using Fast-Plus EvaGreen qPCR
Master Mix kit (Biotium, Hayward, CA). Relative expression level
for each target gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene
GAPDH. A negative control with non-genetic material was included
to eliminate nonspecific reactions or contamination. Each sample
was tested in triplicate and the 2DDCTmethod was used to analyze
the relative transcription data (Rodrigues Hell et al., 2009). The
following primer sequences were used: TNF-a: TNF-a_fwd AGGAGAAGTTCCCAAATG
, TNF-a_rev GTATGAAGTGGCAAATCG; IL-6: IL-
6_fwd TTGGGACTGATGTTGTTG, IL-6_rev TGAATGACTCTGGCTTTG.
GAPDH: GAPDH_fwd TGAGGCCGGTGCTGAGTATGT, GAPDH_rev

2.12. Data analysis
Data were expressed as means ± SEM, and statistical significance
was assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
subsequent Turkey’s tests. P< 0.05 was considered significant.
⁄P< 0.05, ⁄⁄P< 0.01, and ⁄⁄⁄P< 0.001 compared to OGD/R with

3. Results
3.1. Isoquercetin protects primary culture of rat cortical neurons
against OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity
To elucidate the question of whether isoquercetin could protect
primarycultureof ratcorticalneuronsagainstI/Rinjury,weadapted
an in vitro OGD/R procedure to mimic ischemic stroke as described
(Qi et al., 2012; Su et al., 2012). The cell viability was determined
based on the reduction of MTT assay by mitochondrial reductase
in the viable cells. Cultured cortical neurons were pre-conditioned
with isoquercetin for 24 h prior to OGD for 6 h and subsequent
normoxia for 24 h recovery. As shown in Fig. 1a, isoquercetin with
concentration of 40 and 80lg/ml significantly promoted cell viability
of cultured cortical neurons. We also demonstrated that the protective
activity of nimodipine at the concentration of 2.5 and 5lg/ml
by significantly improvement of cell viability. These results

stronglysuggestthatisoquercetinprotectsprimaryculturedcortical
neurons from OGD/R-induced ischemic injury.
3.2. Isoquercetin protects primary culture of rat cortical neurons
against OGD/R-induced LDH release
To further address the protective activity of isoquercetin on
cultured cortical neurons from OGD/R injury, LDH assay was
performed to assess whether isoquercetin can secure against
OGD/R-induced membrane damage. As shown in Fig. 1b, 20, 40
and 80lg/ml of isoquercetin and 2.5 and 5lg/ml of nimodipine
were respectively added to the culture medium 24 h prior to
OGD until the end of recovery. OGD/R significantly increased
LDH release of cortical neurons compared with the control. When
cells were preincubated with isoquercetin at different concentration
of 20, 40 and 80lg/ml for 24 h, and then exposed to OGD
6 h, followed by 24 h reperfusion, LDH release was inhibited significantly
compared with the OGD/R alone group. Nimodipine at 2.5
and 5lg/ml also inhibited LDH release induced by OGD/R. The
results suggest that isoquercetin pretreatment attenuates OGD/R-
induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell membrane damage
in primary culture of rat cortical neurons.
3.3. Isoquercetin protects primary culture of rat cortical neurons
against OGD/R-induced [Ca2+]
i
elevation
Large increases in neuronal [Ca2+]
i
are lethal. The OGD/R induced
cell damage has been reported to be correlated with
[Ca2+]
i
elevation (Rui et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2012). Hence, we
examined [Ca2+]
i
in treated cultured cortical neuron cells after
OGD/R. In similar to these reports, OGD/R induced remarkably
[Ca2+]
i
increase, and treatment with isoquercetin (20, 40 and
80lg/ml) and nimodipine (2.5 and 5lg/ml) reduced significantly
[Ca2+]
i
compared with OGD/R group (Fig. 1c).
3.4. Morphological characterization of apoptosis by Hoechst 33342
staining
Nuclear morphology of isoquercetin-treated cells after OGD/R
were performed by membrane permeable Hoechst 33342. As
shown in Fig. 2, nuclei of cells in control cultures appeared with
regular contours and were round or ellipse in shape. In contrast,
many cells with smaller nuclei and condensed chromatin were
seen in OGD/R group, and isoquercetin at three concentrations of
20, 40 and 80lg/ml and nimodipine at two concentrations of 2.5
and 5lg/ml improved morphological characterization and decreased
the number of apoptotic cells. These results showed that
isoquercetin at the three tested concentrations exhibited significantly
anti-apoptotic effects in primary culture of rat cortical
neurons exposed OGD/R.
3.5. FITC-Annexin V/PI double staining
Apoptosis is believed to play an important role in brain
ischemia injury (Sahota and Savitz, 2011). We hence analyze the
possible anti-apoptotic capability of isoquercetin under OGD/R
condition by flow cytometry using FITC-Annexin V/PI double staining.
Annexin V negative and PI negative cells were used as controls,
Annexin V positive and PI negative represent early apoptotic cells,
and Annexin V positive and PI positive represent late apoptotic and
necrotic cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the cells of control
group had almost no apoptotic cells detected. In OGD/R treated
group, a lot of apoptotic cells were observed. However, the number
of apoptotic cells was decreased significantly by the treatment of
cells with isoquercetin at the doses of 20, 40 and 80lg/ml, indicating
that isoquercetin could inhibit early event of the apoptotic process.
Nimodipine at 2.5 and 5lg/ml also significantly decreased
the number of apoptotic cells.
3.6. Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3
It is known that caspases-3 is a common surrogate marker
during initiation and progress of apoptosis and especially cleaved
caspase-3 is well known as an executioner protease of apoptosis
after cerebral ischemia (Broughton et al., 2009; Wagner et al.,
2011). We investigated the mechanisms by which isoquercetin
worked against apoptosis, by analyzing the expression levels of
the pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3. After OGD/R, the
protein level of cleaved caspase-3 was increased remarkably in
the OGD/R group, whereas isoquercetin at 40 and 80lg/ml and
nimodipine at 2.5 and 5lg/ml decreased significantly the protein
level of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4d). These results indicated that
isoquercetin might prevent OGD/R-induced neuronal apoptosis
by modulating the expression of cleaved caspase-3.
3.7. Effect of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 pathway in isoquercetinmediated
anti-apoptosis
We then investigated whether ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 pathway
participated in the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin on
OGD/R injury. As illustrated in Fig. 4a–c, cortical neurons exposed
to OGD/R showed an increase in the expression of p-ERK1/2,
p-JNK1/2 and p-p38. However, p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 were
greatly returned after pretreatment with 80lg/ml isoquercetin

and 2.5 and 5lg/ml nimodipine significantly reduced the
increased expression levels of p–p38 induced by OGD/R.
3.8. The involvement of the TLR4 and NF-jB signaling pathway in the
protection of isoquercetin
To further elucidate mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective
effect of isoquercetin, we examined the protein expression of
TLR4 and NF-jB and mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-6 after
OGD/R. In OGD/R group, protein expression of TLR4 and NF-jB
and mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-6 were significantly elevated
(Fig. 5). Isoquercetin and nimodipine significantly decreased
protein expression of TLR4 and NF-jB and mRNA expression of
TNF-a and IL-6, which was respectively most obvious at the doses
of 40–80lg/ml and 5lg/ml. These results suggest that modulation
of TLR4, NF-jB, TNF-a and IL-6 may be involved in the neuroprotective
effect of isoquercetin on OGD/R-induced injury.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that isoquercetin
protected primary culture of rat cortical neuronal cells from
OGD/R-induced cell damage. Our data were obtained using OGD/R
model, a highly reproducible and appropriate in vitro model of
ischemic stroke, in which we evaluated primary culture of rat cortical
neuronal injury. We found, isoquercetin administered prior to
the insult could prevent the OGD/R induced intracellular Ca2+overload
, LDH release and cell viability decrease. Isoquercetin is firstly
described as a neuroprotective agent that potentially explains the
alleviation and prevention from hypoxia–ischemia-induced injury
in neurons. Mechanistic studies showed that the neuroprotective
effect of isoquercetin was performed by anti-inflammatory signaling
pathway of inhibiting protein expression of TLR4 and NF-jB,
and mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-6, accompanied by the
anti-apoptotic signaling pathway of deactivation of ERK, JNK and
p38, and inhibition of caspase-3.
Inflammatory responses play a crucial role in cerebral ischemic
injuries and neuronal cell apoptosis (Arumugam et al., 2007;
Ishikawa et al., 2005). Cerebral ischemia triggers inflammatory
responses, which has been associated with TLR signaling, thus
reducing the inflammation that exacerbates ischemic brain injury.
Numerous inflammatory mediators are induced at the transcriptional
level, including enzymes required for prostaglandin synthesis
, cytokines (for example, IL-6 and TNF-a), and chemokines.
TLR4 has been implicated in cerebral I/R injury (Caso et al.,
2007; Hua et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). Mice deficient in
TLR4 show reduced infarct sizes and improved neurological
outcome when compared with wild-type littermates (Caso
et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007). Neurons deficient in TLR4 showed
increased resistance and less apoptotic cell death when subjected

to glucose deprivation as an in vitro model of ischemic conditions
(Tang et al., 2007). In addition, TLR4 expression was increased in
mouse brain after cerebral ischemia (Cao et al., 2007; Hua et al.,
2007; Tang et al., 2008). Furthermore, TLR4 mutant mice subjected
to MCAO or global cerebral I/R models exhibit improved
neurological behavior and reduced edema, as well as reduced levels
of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, such as TNF-a and IL-6
(Cao et al., 2007; Caso et al., 2007, 2008), in the serum. During
ischemia, IL-6 and TNF-a are produced by a variety of activated
cell types (Huang et al., 2006). Up-regulation of TNF-a mRNA parallels
that of IL-6 mRNA within the first hour after ischemia
(Huang et al., 2006). Both experimental and human data indicate
a positive correlation between TNF-a and the extent of ischemic
injury. For example, a study of 24 patients with ischemic stroke
found that levels of TNF-a were markedly increased within 24 h
of ischemic stroke and that the levels of serum TNF-a were positively
correlated with infarct volume (Zaremba et al., 2001). TNF-
a induces adhesion molecule expression in cerebral endothelial
cells and promotes neutrophil accumulation and transmigration.
In rats subjected to permanent MCAO, IL-6 mRNA expression is
up-regulated (Wang et al., 1995). Data from human studies suggest
a proinflammatory role for IL-6 in stroke. Peripheral blood
levels of IL-6 are higher in stroke patients and detectable within
a few hours of stroke onset and higher serum levels of IL-6 correlate
with larger infarct size and poorer clinical outcome (Huang
et al., 2006). NF-jB, as an important nuclear transcription factor,
involves regulating gene expression related to the innate and
inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that NF-jB activation
is primarily mediated by the TLR signaling pathway. NF-jB
is a terminal key element, and the terminal effect of NF-jB activation
is to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and
TNF-a (Hayden et al., 2006). In agreement with these reports,
our results demonstrated that OGD/R induced the upregulation
of protein expression of TLR4 and NF-jB and mRNA expression
of TNF-a and IL-6. The pretreatment of isoquercetin at 40 and
80lg/ml deactivated the activity of TLR4 and NF-jB and downregulated
mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-6 after OGD/R. These
results showed that the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin
was partly through the anti-inflammatory signaling pathway of
inhibiting TLR4 and NF-jB protein levels, and mRNA expressions
of TNF-a and IL-6 in primary cultured cortical neurons. That TLR4
knockout also promotes neuronal survival supports our present
findings, providing additional evidence for TLR4’s harmful effects
(Cao et al., 2007; Caso et al., 2007, 2008).

Inflammation and apoptosis both depend largely on gene
expression and share key regulators (Kilic et al., 2008). The activation
of p38 and JNK signaling way play a critical role in I/R injury
(Gao et al., 2005; Kilic et al., 2012). Reports have shown agents that
inhibit the activation of p38 and JNK1/2 and that improve the
outcome of ischemic brain injury by downregulating apoptosis
signaling (Borsello et al., 2003; Nito et al., 2008). Consistent with
these reports, we observed that isoquercetin reduced the phosphorylation
of p38 and JNK1/2 following OGD/R. The roles of ERK
in the pathophysiology of focal cerebral ischemia are still controversial.
Some reports demonstrated that ischemia induced inhibition
of ERK1/2 that resulted in neuronal damage, and activation
of ERK1/2 has neuroprotective effects (Hu et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2012). However, it was also suggested that the phosphorylation

of ERK after ischemia might support neuronal damage (Ishitsuka
et al., 2012; Subramaniam et al., 2004). In the present study, we
found that the level of p-ERK1/2 was persistently increased after
OGD/R. Importantly, the administration of isoquercetin prevented
the increased level of p-ERK1/2. In addition, caspase-3 as a key
mediator of apoptosis, is activated by cleavage, and active
caspase-3 leads to DNA fragmentation and eventually apoptosis
(Yu et al., 2010). We found that 20, 40, 80lg/ml isoquercetin decreased
the level of cleaved caspase-3. These results suggested that
one of the mechanisms of action of isoquercetin against injury by
OGD/R could be partly related to its anti-apoptotic effects.
Therefore, isoquercetin administered prior to the insult prevented
OGD/R induced cell damage in primary culture of rat cortical
neuron cells by anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting
TLR4–NF-rB signaling pathway and anti-apoptotic effects through
downregulating the OGD/R induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
JNK1/2, p38, and caspase-3 activity. Previous studies have demonstrated
that TLR4 deficiency reduces phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
JNK1/2 and p38 (Kilic et al., 2008; Loniewski et al., 2007). Therefore
, the results obtained from the present study suggested that
the deactivation of TLR4–NF-rB signaling pathway regulating
phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 pathway participated
in the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin in primary culture
of rat cortical neurons exposed to OGD/R. By demonstrating
that isoquercetin reduces TLR4 and NF-rB activity and mRNA
expression of TNF-a and IL-6, as well as deactivating ERK1/2,
JNK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and caspase-3 activity, we provided
insights into the mechanisms of neuroprotection induced
by isoquercetin possibly via TLR4-NF-rB deactivation. In addition,
the OGD/R treatment of primary culture of rat cortical neurons induced
intracellular Ca2+ overload, LDH release and cell viability
reduction. In isoquercetin treated groups, cells exhibited improved
neurological morphology and biochemical parameters including
down-regulation of [Ca2+]
i
and LDH release, and cell viability increase
, as well as reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine
secretion such as TNF-a and IL-6. The release of TNF-a was previously
shown to be mediated by MAP kinases in cultured macrophages
(Schroder et al., 2001). In the present study, deactivation
of TLR4-NF-rB signaling pathway using isoquercetin treatment
abolished OGD/R-induced ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation
, while pharmacological ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 blockade
might prevent OGD/R-induced TNF-a secretion. By revealing that
ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which are activated upon OGD/R for primary
cultured cortical neurons, are dephosphorylated when TLR4 is
deactivated in isoquercetin treatment groups, we for the first time
showed that isoquercetin exhibited neuroprotective effects by
MAP kinases which are involved in TLR4–NF-rB signaling
in vitro. These results supported those reported in previous studies
(Kilic et al., 2005, 2008). As shown in the intestine, destructive
inflammation driven by TNF also requires activation of MAPKs,
ERK and p38 (Guma et al., 2011). Therefore, these ERK, JNK and
p38 signaling pathways by TLR4–NF-rB deactivation are potential
targets for modulation by isoquercetin, resulting in suppression
of cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 to elicit anti-inflammatory
and anti-apoptotic effects in the primary culture of rat cortical
neurons exposed by OGD/R.
5. Conclusions
Taken together, the results obtained from the present study
provided the evidence that isoquercetin protected primary culture
of rat cortical neuronal cells from OGD/R-induced cell damage. For
the first time, isoquercetin is described as an anti-inflammation
and anti-apoptosis factor that potentially explains the survival
from I/R via TLR4-NF-rB signaling pathway mediating ERK, JNK,
p38 and cleaved caspase-3 pathways. As a neuroprotective agent,
isoquercetin were shown to be potent against I/R injury in primary
culture of rat cortical neuronal cells by pre-ischemic treatment in
this study. Therefore, this study highlights the confirmation of isoquercetin
, a flavonoid compound, as an anti-inflammatory and
anti-apoptosis agent which might be used as a therapeutic strategy
for the I/R injury and related diseases. Our further studies on the
neuroprotective effects of isoquercetin against I/R injury are still
in processing.
