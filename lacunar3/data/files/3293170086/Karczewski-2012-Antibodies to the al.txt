Abstract
Background: Circulating agonistic autoantibodies acting at G protein-coupled receptors have been associated with
numerous sever pathologies in humans. Antibodies directed predominantly against the a
1
-adrenergig receptor were
detected in patients suffering from widespread diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Their deleterious action
has been demonstrated for peripheral organs. We postulate that antibodies to the a
1
-adrenergig receptor are relevant
pathomolecules in diseases of the central nervous system associated with vascular impairments.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a rat model we studied the long-term action of antibodies against the a
1
-
adrenergig receptor either induced by immunization with a receptor peptide or applied by intravenous injection. The
vasculature in the rat brains was investigated by time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography using a 9.4 Tesla small
animal MR imaging system. Visual examination of maximum-intensity-projections (MIPs) of brain angiographs revealed the
development of vascular defects in antibody- exposed animals between three and eight months of treatment. Relative
vascular areas were derived from representative MIP image sections by grayscale analysis and used to form an index of
vascular circulation. Animals exposed to the action of a
1
-adrenergig receptor antibodies showed significantly reduced
vascular areas (p,0.05). Calculated index values indicated attenuated blood flow in both antibody-treated cohorts
compared to their respective controls reaching with (relative units 6 standard error, n = 10) 0.83960.026 versus
0.91960.026 statistical significance (p,0.05) for peptide-immunized rats.
Conclusion/Significance: We present evidence that antibodies to the a
1
-adrenergig receptor cause cerebrovascular
impairments in the rat. Our findings suggest the pathological significance of these antibodies in pathologies of the human
central nervous system linked to impairments of brain vasculature such as stroke and dementia.

Introduction
Structural and functional impairments of the vasculature are
causally linked or significantly contribute to different pathologies
in humans, among them numerous widespread diseases. In the
cardiovascular system hypertension, angina pectoris and cardiac
infarction involve vascular impairments. Patients suffering from
diabetes develop vascular injuries. Severe defects of blood supply
to and circulation in the brain are the acute cause of stroke. Brain
vasculature is critical for the development of different types of
dementia such as Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. There is
evidence that dementia of the Alzheimer’s type may be primary a
vascular disease [1]. Thus, damages in the blood vessel system
represent a significant factor in the development and progression
of numerous severe diseases.
Agonistic autoantibodies acting at G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCR) have been detected in the circulation of patients with
different, mainly cardiovascular diseases [2,3]. These antibodies
bind to epitopes localized at the extracellular loops of GPCR,
thereby activating the receptor system in a similar but not identical

(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
manner as the physiological agonists. They may disable protective
mechanisms of the target cell such as receptor desensitization
resulting in prolonged, unphysiological activation of receptor
pathways [4]. Their pathogenic potential was demonstrated in
animal models and in clinical studies [5–9]. Agonistic autoantibodies
to the a
1
-adrenergic receptor (a
1
-AR) were found to be
associated with widespread diseases such as different types of
hypertension and type 2 diabetes [9,10–12]. Antibodies to the a
1
-
AR were shown to cause cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and diastolic
dysfunction in rats [7,13]. In patients with refractory hypertension
the removal of antibodies toa
1
-AR by immunoadsorption resulted
in a significant and long-lasting decline of the mean arterial blood
pressure [9]. Considering the central role of a
1
-AR in the
regulation of blood vessels, the occurrence of antibodies acting at
this receptor in diseases with significant vascular involvements
suggests their importance in vascular pathology [14]. Rats
immunized with a
1
-AR peptides developed receptor-specific
antibodies and damages in the aorta and mesenteric artery [8].
The present investigation aimed at shedding light on the
potential of a
1
-AR antibodies to cause damages in the vasculature
of the central nervous system. We therefore studied the long-term
effects of a
1
-AR antibodies in vital rats by time-of-flight magnetic
resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) using a 9.4 Tesla small
animal magnetic resonance imaging system. We observed
substantial attenuations of vascular blood flow in the brain after
long-term exposure to the a
1
-AR antibody.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines provided and approved by the animal welfare
department of the Landesamt fu ¨r Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin (Berlin
State Office of Health and Social Affairs, Permit Number: G0197/
10). Taking blood samples and imaging experiments were
performed under isoflurane anesthesia. All manipulations of
animals were performed by authorized personnel, and all efforts
were made to minimize suffering of animals.
Animals and Housing Conditions
Forty male Wistar rats (10–13 weeks of age, 280–350 g) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany.
Animals were housed in one acclimatized windowless indoor room
in standard IVC cages Type 1500 (Techni-Plast, Sulingen,
Germany) with a wire mesh top in groups of maximum 3 animals
dependent on weight. The animals had free access to commercial
rodent food, and tap water was available ad libitum. The
environmental conditions were held constant, room temperature
20+2uC and 50–60% relative humidity. The animals were allowed
to acclimatize before studies took place.
Materials
The synthetic peptide PAPEDETICQINEE (BioSyntan, Berlin,
Germany) corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the
human a
1
-AR isoform A was coupled to bovine serum albumin
(BSA) by the glutaraldehyde method. The peptide-BSA reaction
product was desalted and pre-buffered to phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) using Sephadex-G25 columns (PD-10 columns, GE
Healthcare, UK). For controls, BSA fractions were prepared the
same way except the peptide was absent. Antiserum to the a
1
-AR
peptide was produced in goat (BioGenes, Berlin, Germany). The
antiserum was affinity purified by column chromatography using
the peptide immobilized to an agarose matrix (a
1
-AR antibody).
Goat control immune gamma globulin was obtained from
Dianova, Hamburg, Germany (control IgG).
Immunization and Antibody Analysis
To four experimental cohorts 10 rats each were allocated at
random. One cohort (AB) obtained intravenous injections of a
1
-
AR antibody (700 mg/kg body weigh). The corresponding control
group (C-AB) was injected with the same dose of control IgG. The
injections were repeated monthly. A third cohort of animals (PEP)
was immunized by subcutaneous injection of 300 mg a
1
-AR-
peptide coupled to BSA and emulsified in incomplete Freund’s
adjuvance at 0, 2 and 4 weeks. Then the injections were repeated
monthly. The respective control animals (C-PEP) were subcutaneously
injected with BSA. Blood aliquots were taken from
anesthetized animals by retro-orbital sampling. The obtained sera
were analyzed for the presence of a
1
-AR antibodies by standard
ELISA techniques. For detecting the systemic immune response
and the applied goat a
1
-AR antibody (cohorts AB and C-AB),
aliquots of rat serum were bound to 96-well plates (Perbio Science,
Bonn, Germany) and probed with anti-rat IgG and anti-goat IgG,
respectively. To specifically detect a
1
-AR antibodies generated in
immunized rats (cohorts PEP and C-PEP), the immobilizeda
1
-AR
peptide was used as capture antigen. As secondary antibody
horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rat IgG or anti-goat IgG
was used as appropriate. Antibody binding was visualized by the 1-
Step Ultra TMB ELISA (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany). The
absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a SLT Spectra
multiplate reader (TECAN, Crailsheim, Germany).
Time-of-flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography
For the imaging experiments animals were anesthetized in a
warmed anesthetic chamber using 3.5% isoflurane in an oxygen/
air mixture (300:700) with a flow rate of 1000 ml/min. After
approximately one minute the isoflurane was reduced to 2% to
3%. A body temperature of 37uC was maintained throughout the
experiments by warming the animal bed using a circulating heated
water system (Thermo Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and
monitoring by a rectal temperature probe. Respiratory signals
were continuously monitored using a commercial monitoring and
gating system (SA Instruments, Inc., New York, USA) and kept
between 50–70 respiration cycles per minute by regulating the
isoflurane dose.
All imaging experiments were carried out on a 9.4T small
animal MR system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen,
Germany). A curved four channel receive only rat brain coil array
(Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) was used in conjunction
with a linear polarized birdcage resonator for transmission (Bruker
Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany; inner diameter of 72 mm). Due to
the large increase in body size with age a shorter head-only
birdcage resonator (in-house built; inner diameter of 75 mm) was
used for transmission at 11 months.
For anatomical reference and to screen for possible pathologies
(morphological, hemorrhage, edema) a high resolution T

weighted RARE sequence (TE/TR = 33 ms/2723 ms, field of
view = 35 mm, matrix size = 3846384, voxel size

Time-of-flight angiograms were acquired using a 2D FLASH
sequence (TE/TR/FA = 3.9 ms/18 ms/90u, matrix
size = 3846384, 198 image slices, field of view = 38.4638.4, voxel
size = 10061006150 mm3) in coronal orientation.
Image Processing
To analyze TOF-MRA measurements maximum-intensityprojections
(MIPs) were produced using the OSIRIS software
Antibodies Impair Rat Brain Vasculature

(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
(version 4.07, Digital Imaging Unit, University Hospital of
Geneva, Schweiz). In the two-dimensional viewer mode images
were virtually screened using coronal MIP-slabs of three millimeter
thickness to find the appropriate image section for visual
evaluation. This interactive approach aimed at defining the
corresponding section plane of TOF-MRA measurements of each
animal at 3 months and 11 month for comparison. All efforts were
made to select the same brain section and angle of view for the
two-dimensional MIPs at both time points for each animal. The
respective two-dimensional MIP image, which was subsequently
used for grayscale analysis, was checked against the threedimensional
MIP view of the entire volume covered by the
TOF-MRA to verify the visually observed alterations and to
exclude artifacts due to spatial variations in brain vascular
architecture.
Data Processing/grayscale Analysis
Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software (version 1.46,
Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, USA). Edgepreserving
median filtering was performed for smoothing and to
remove background noise. For each two-dimensional image
section basic statistical parameters were calculated. The vascular
fractions of images were differentiated based on the assumption
that the most frequent and highest ranked median gray value
represents the image background consisting of tissue not perfused
with blood. Grey values above median plus two standard
deviations were considered to correspond to the vascular fraction
of the image. A threshold operation was performed to obtain black
and white images. White areas representing the vascular fractions
were estimated using the histogram. Changes in brain vascular
circulation are expressed as ratio of the relative vascular areas of
the last and the first TOF-MRA.
Statistics
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for
Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA).
Statistical significances were calculated with the unpaired
Student’s t-test after data had been checked for normal
distribution. Differences with p-values,0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Induction of Antibodies to the a
1
-adrenergic Receptor in
Rats
Animals receiving intravenously a
1
-AR-antibodies produced in
goat (cohort AB) showed a fast clearance of these antibodies from
the circulation. Six hours after injection of a
1
-AR-antibodies there
was still a high level of the antibody detectable. Then the a
1
-AR-
antibody level declined to less than 10% of the 6-hour value at day
1 and was not detectable in most animals after day 3. The peptide
used for immunizing rats (cohort PEP) corresponds to the cell
surface epitope of the rat a1-AR which is permanently exposed to
the immune system. To ensure that there is an immune reaction to
the application of the autoantigen, the IgG status of the animals
was measured. Compared to the pre-immune situation, there was
an increase in IgG. Thus, the immunization procedure was
efficient and resulted in a systemic immune response. Analysis of
the specific immune response to the peptide antigen demonstrated
low levels of a
1
-AR-specific antibodies in serum samples of the
animals. Figure 1 illustrates the situation of a
1
-AR antibody
formation in peptide- (PEP) and vehicle-immunized rats (C-PEP)
one month before the final TOF-MRA measurement.
Time-of-flight Angiography (TOF-MRA) of Rats
The total period of observation was 11 months. During this time
span there was a massive growth of the rats resulting in more than
doubling of their body mass. The increase within the first three
months of the observation was with 60% much higher than
between month three and month 11 with 26%. Considering
previous experiences and data from comparable animal studies of
other groups, vascular alterations were unlikely to be visible
already after three months of treatment [5–8]. Therefore TOFMRA
images taken at month 3 and at month 11 after the
beginning of the treatment were used for evaluation. Thereby we
thought to reduce the impact of developmental changes for size
and architecture of brain vasculature and thus to improve
comparability of angiographs taken at different time.
Anatomical magnetic resonance images of the rat brain and
maximum-intensity-projections (MIP) of corresponding TOFMRA
data are shown in Figure 2. The vasculature inside and
outside of the brain was very well depicted.
Visual image evaluation. Visual screening of TOF-MRA
MIP images revealed impairments of vascular blood flow in the
anterior part of the brain in most of the animals of both cohorts
exposed to a
1
-AR antibody action within eight months of
observation. In the cohort of rats immunized with the a
1
-AR
peptide (PEP) 8 out of 10 animals showed visible vascular defects
which were abundantly clear in four individuals. Notably, larger
vessels in the right part of the brain appeared to be preferentially
affected.Figure 3 A, B exemplifies coronal two-dimensional MIP
sections approximately at the level of the hypothalamus taken at
the early stage of immunization with thea
1
-AR -peptide (A) and at
the end of the treatment eight months later (B). When comparing
the images regional damages in blood flow were obvious which
developed within eight months of repeated immunizations with the
a
1
-AR -peptide (B versus A).Figure 3 C, D shows an example of
comparable two-dimensional views of a brain from a control
animal. In this case, no defects were detectable at the end of the
observation period. However, 3 out of 10 animals in the control
group (C-PEP) also showed brain regions with impaired blood
flow. Although they appeared less pronounced when judged
visually, quantifiable measures are required to verify these
observations.
Visual evaluation of TOF-MRA MIP sections of rats injected
with a
1
-AR antibodies (cohort AB) showed a similar situation as
obtained for the a
1
-AR peptide-treated animals. Comparing the
two-dimensional MIP sections of the same individual, there were
clearly vascular defects visible at 11 months after the beginning of
the treatment in 9 out of 10 animals with 4 rats showing only
slightly affected blood flow. As in peptide-treated rats, the

impairment of different, predominantly larger brain vessels was
obvious. In the respective control group (C-AB) which received
control IgG, 3 out of 9 animals developed clearly visible defects.
Three-dimensional MIPs of brain TOF-MRA as depicted in
Figure 4 for the peptide-treated animal were compared with twodimensional
MIP sections. The three dimensional display
confirmed the observed defects and ruled out errors due to
possible spatial variations of the brain vascular tree.
Quantitation of vessel areas by grayscale analysis. Gray
scale analysis of two-dimensional TOF-MRA MIP sections was
performed to approximate relative values of vascular areas. An
essential step of the employed procedure is the generation of black
and white images. An example is given in Figure 5 for an animal
injected with the a
1
-AR antibody (Figure 5 A, B) and a control
animal (Figure 5 C, D). The white areas correspond to blood
perfused vessels. Their quantification produces a relative measure
for the area of the functionally intact vasculature. Table 1 gives
the calculated mean relative vascular areas for the experimental
groups. Comparing the values obtained from measurement 1 and
measurement 2 eight months later, there was a small, but
statistically significant reduction of vessel area within the
observation period for both, rats treated with the a
1
-AR antibody
(AB) and rats immunized with the a
1
-AR peptide (PEP). The
respective control animals (C-AB, C-PEP) showed slightly, but not
significantly decreased mean vascular areas at the final measurement.
To compensate for differences between the experimental
groups already obvious at the beginning of the observation, the
ratio of relative vascular areas of the final measurement 2 and of
the initial measurement 1 was calculated for each animal. This
ratio served as an index for changes of vascular blood flow and was
used to compare the animal cohorts exposed to a
1
-AR antibody
action (AB, PEP) with their respective control cohorts (C-AB, CPEP
). Values,1 indicate impaired blood flow. The box plot in
Figure 6 depicts these data of brain relative vascular circulation.
Both treatment groups, rats injected with thea
1
-AR antibody (AB)
and rats immunized with the a
1
-AR peptide (PEP) showed larger
decrements compared to the respective control animals (C-AB, CPEP
). The decline in the a
1
-AR peptide- treated cohort (PEP) was
with (relative units 6 standard error) 0.83960.026 versus
0.91960.026 of the C-PEP control cohort statistically significant
(p,0.05). There was a clear tendency towards attenuated brain
blood circulation also in the a
1
-AR antibody- treated animals
which, however, did not reach statistical significance (0.82260.021
for AB versus 0.87760.029 for C-AB). Both control cohorts
showed values of relative vascular circulation slightly below 1
indicating some worsening of blood supply in the brain during the
observation period.
Discussion
We demonstrate first evidence of the pathogenic significance of
antibodies to the a
1
-AR in the brain vasculature of rats by TOFMRA.
Two parallel approaches, immunization of animals with the
a
1
-AR peptide and injection of the a
1
-AR antibody, resulted in
impairments of brain blood flow.
For immunizing animals we used a peptide exactly corresponding
to the extracellular region of the a
1
-AR which contains the
antibody epitope. This approach differs from previous studies with
regard to the peptides used for immunization. In these studies
longer a
1
-AR peptides were used containing amino acid stretches
of transmembrane regions of the receptor [7,8,13]. The extracellular
receptor region, the peptide’s amino acid sequence was

derived from, is exposed to and normally tolerated by the immune
system of the animal. Therefore the peptide which represents an
autoantigen may be critical to induce antibody production when
used for immunization. This may explain the relatively low a

antibody levels of the animals observed in the present study
although the generalized immune response demonstrated the
efficiency of the immunization procedure. In a parallel approach,
rats were treated by intravenous injection of an antibody raised
against the a

to be agonistic and to act comparable to a

from hypertensive patients [9,15]. The intravenously injected a

the rats. Human IgG applied to mice was reported to persist in the

domain raised in rats and then transferred into naive rats, a halflife
time in the circulation of nine days was reported [5]. In the
present study the a

generated in a different animal species, and a fast clearance of
the antibody by the immune system must be expected. However,
the serum concentration of the antibody does not necessarily
reflect the situation at its binding sites. Low levels of the antibody
were detectable up to two days in the circulation of the animals
and were obviously sufficient to act at the a

protocol specific MR parameters (flip angle, repetition time), and
geometrical parameters like image slice thickness and image
orientation, or blood flow velocity. Assuming the T
1
of blood and
all MR acquisition parameters being the same in all experiments,
the enhancement of blood is primarily flow-related and allows for
the assessment of vascular impairments, such as reduced flow
velocity or turbulences.
The most striking defects visible in TOF-MRA MIP sections
from animals exposed to the action ofa
1
-AR antibodies concerned
larger vessels. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells expressa
1
-
AR and thus present binding sites for agonistic autoantibodies in
small and large vessels. The unphysiological stimulation of a
1
-AR
pathways by agonistic autoantibodies results in pathological
changes of cell functions and eventually may lead to substantial
cell death and thus to severe damages of vessel structure. Agonistic
autoantibodies to the a
1
-AR were demonstrated to induce
hyperplasia of smooth muscle in large vessels such as aorta and
mesenteric arteries accompanied by the reduction of the vessel
lumen [8]. Furthermore, impairments of the vascular endothelial
may generate foci for clot formation. The resulting damages are
likely to cause the massive attenuation or even cessation of blood
flow as depicted by TOF-MRA also in large vessels. Signal
intensity in TOF-MRA depends on the velocity of flowing blood.
Zero blood flow gives no signal and thus results in the apparent
disappearance of the afflicted vessel as shown in Figures 3 and 4.
However, more information on the morphological state of the
vessel can not be obtained by TOF-MRA.
To affirm the visually detected defects in brain vessels of animals
exposed to the action of the a
1
-AR antibodies, relative correlates
of vascular circulation were obtained by grayscale analysis of
TOF-MRA MIPs. A crucial and critical step to differentiate vessels
from surrounding brain tissue was the threshold operation using
the median plus two standard deviations. This operation robustly
eliminated noise and tissue background, but implied the loss of
some smaller or less perfused vessels. The rat is known for the large
potential to develop collateral vessels [17]. This ability contributes
to the high degree of variability in the architecture of rat brain
vasculature. The elimination of some smaller vessels, which likely
comprise also newly developed collaterals, may improve the
comparability of the brain vascular tree of the same animal at
different ages. The reduction of relative vascular areas between the
first and the final TOF-MRA within the individual experimental
groups was significant for both cohorts of animals exposed to the
action of a
1
-AR antibody. Index values indicated significant
attenuation of vascular circulation in a
1
-AR peptide-immunized
rats compared to controls. Considering the loss of a fraction of
smaller vessels due to the stringent threshold operation, the
observed deleterious effects on brain vasculature may be still
underestimated. Furthermore, hemodynamic changes as result of
the reduction of vessel lumen, which was reported to be part ofa
1
-
AR antibody action, are not addressed by the techniques
employed in the present study [7].
Data also clearly demonstrate the tendency for impaired
circulation in the brain of both control cohorts at the end of the
treatment period. This is in line with the visual observations of
vascular defects in some of control animals. Worsening of blood
supply in the brain may be attributed to degenerative processes
known to typically occur with aging. At the final TOF-MRA
measurement the animals were with 17 months relatively old given
the average live span of rats.
The defects observed by TOF-MRA indicate the loss or the
reduction of vascular blood flow in the respective brain region
most likely caused by pathological alterations of vessel morphology.
Damages of target organs caused by antibodies directed at G
protein-coupled receptors were reported in numerous animal
studies [5,7,8,13,16]. Rats immunized with peptides corresponding
to the second extracellular loop of the a
1
-AR showed signs of
cardiac remodeling, developed left ventricular damages with
diastolic dysfunction and vascular damages in aorta and mesenteric
artery [7–9]. Autoantibodies to the a
1
-AR isolated from
hypertensive patients and a
1
-AR antibodies raised in rabbits
induced signaling pathways involved in cardiac and vascular
remodeling [9].
The importance of antibodies directed at the a
1
-AR in vascular
pathology was shown for peripheral vessels such as aorta and
mesenteric artery [8,9,13]. Here we demonstrate the deleterious
action of a
1
-AR antibodies in the vasculature of the central
nervous system of rats. Agonistic antibodies to the a
1
-AR were
found to be associated with different forms of hypertension and
type 2 diabetes, widespread diseases with a crucial role of vascular
impairments [9–12]. Vascular damages are most likely the
mechanism linking type 2 diabetes to cerebrovascular diseases
[18,19]. The present data extend the importance of antibodies to
the a
1
-AR to diseases which directly affect the central nervous
system such as stroke and dementia. They may be part of the
mechanism of age-related cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVD)
affecting blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and known to be a
major cause for stroke-like symptoms and pre-stages of vascular
dementia [20]. Progressing vascular damages worsen blood and
oxygen supply in brain regions and eventually cause stroke.
Notably, there is a link between stroke and dementia. Patients who
suffered from stroke have an increased risk of faster and earlier
developing dementia [21]. Dementia of the vascular and the
Alzheimer’s type are difficult to discriminate, and typically they
develop coincidentally. Recently we identified autoantibodies
predominantly directed at the a
1
-AR in the circulation of patients
with Alzheimer’s/vascular dementia [22]. The mechanisms
underlying Alzheimer’s dementia are still a matter of dispute.
There is growing evidence that also Alzheimer’s disease is primary
a vascular disease [1]. Damages in brain vessels may attenuate the
clearance of b-amyloid from neuronal tissue in patients, a
mechanism which increasingly becomes acknowledged to be
crucial for the progression of the disease [23].
Taken together, in the present study we provide evidence for the
potential of a
1
-AR antibodies to cause damages of brain vessels in
a rat model. Our data suggest the pathogenic significance of
autoimmunity to the a
1
-AR for diseases of the central nervous
system such as stroke and dementia. They further affirm previous
evidences that a
1
-AR autoantibodies are important players in
vascular pathology.
