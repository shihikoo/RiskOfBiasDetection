Adult neurogenesis
Could impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis be a relevant mechanism underlying CADASIL (cerebral autosomal
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)? Memory symptoms inCADASIL,
the most common hereditary form of vascular dementia, are usually thought to be primarily due to vascular
degeneration and white matter lacunes. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process essential for the
integration of new spatial memory occurs in a highly vascularized niche, we considered dysregulation of adult
neurogenesisasa potential mechanismfor themanifestation of dementiainCADASIL.Analysisinagedmice overexpressing
Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation, revealed vascular deficits in arteries of the hippocampalfissure but
not in the niche of the dentate gyrus. At 12 months of age, cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons
were reduced not only in CADASIL mice but also in transgenic controls overexpressing wild type Notch3. At 6
months, hippocampal neurogenesis was altered in CADASIL mice independent of overt vascular abnormalities
in thefissure. Further, we identified Notch3 expression in hippocampal precursor cells and maturing neurons
in vivoas well as in cultured hippocampal precursor cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed
that Notch3 signaling negatively regulated precursor cell proliferation. Notch3 overexpression also led to deficits
in KCl-induced precursor cell activation. This suggests a cell-autonomous effect of Notch3 signaling in the regulation
of precursor proliferation and activation and a loss-of-function effect in CADASIL. Consequently, besides
vascular damage, aberrant precursor cell proliferation and differentiation due to Notch3 dysfunction might be
an additional independent mechanism for the development of hippocampal dysfunction in CADASIL.

Introduction
CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is the most common heritable
cause of stroke and vascular dementia (Joutel et al., 1996; Dichgans,
2007; Chabriat et al., 2009). The hallmark of the disease is the accumulation
of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in small and medium
sized arteries, which is followed by a progressive degeneration of
vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC). Patients carrying this NOTCH3
mutation develop progressive arteriole dysfunction followed by subcortical
lacunes with white matter injury (Dichgans et al., 1998). White
matter infarcts are usually considered the leading causes of progressive
decline of memory function (Duering et al., 2011). Nevertheless,
CADASIL patients already show a decline in memory function prior to
any infarcts (Taillia et al., 1998; Amberla et al., 2004). Thus, it is still
unclear whether white matter injury and arteriole dysfunction are the
only causes of progressive memory impairment in CADASIL.
Given the key role of the hippocampus in learning and memory it is
surprising that the hippocampus has not received much attention in
the context of CADASIL. OnlyO'Sullivan et al. (2009)identified a correlation
between hippocampal volume and cognitive performance independent
of vascular lesions in CADASIL patients. Further, the lifelong
production of new neurons in the hippocampus, a process know as
adult neurogenesis, is thought to increase plasticity and cognitiveflexibility
(Garthe et al., 2009; Kempermann, 2012; Spalding et al., 2013).
Thus, studies on animal models of neurodegenerative diseases have
revealed abnormal adult neurogenesis and speculated that hippocampal

dysfunction might be partially responsible for the memory impairment
(Winner et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the question of whether the
impairment is a direct consequence or a secondary effect of the disease
mechanism remains.
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in a highly vascularized
niche of the subgranular zone (SGZ) (Palmer et al., 2000). In this niche
capillaries provide the supply of nutrients and oxygen for proliferative
stem and precursor cells. Since CADASIL results in arteriole dysfunction
and decreased bloodflow (Chabriat et al., 2000; Miao et al., 2004), it
seemed plausible that resulting deficits in oxygen and glucose availability
as well as accumulation of toxic by-products might influence adult
hippocampal neurogenesis.
Furthermore, one key regulator in the neurogenesis and angiogenesis
crosstalk is Notch. Notch signaling has been shown to control vessel
sprouting and is required for proliferation and differentiation of stem
and precursor cells (Breunig et al., 2007; Hellstrom et al., 2007; Lugert
et al., 2010). Since CADASIL disease is caused by a Notch3 mutation
and Notch3 is broadly expressed in the developing dentate gyrus (Irvin
et al., 2001; Lacombe et al., 2005), an influence on adult neurogenesis
seemed plausible.
We undertook the present study to identify whether adult
neurogenesis is altered in a murine model of CADASIL and if so, whether
this would be due to changes in the niche or a direct effect of Notch3 in
hippocampal precursor cells. In order to address this question we used
an established transgenic mouse model overexpressing Notch3 with a
CADASIL-causing point mutation (TgN3R169C) and controlled for the
effects of overexpression in a transgenic mouse model generated by
the same approach overexpressing WT Notch3 (TgN3WT)( Joutel et al.,
2010).
Methods
Animals and tissue preparation
FVBN, C57BL/6J (Charles River), TgN3WTand TgN3R169Cmice (Joutel
et al., 2010), Nestin- GFP mice (Yamaguchi et al., 2000), GFAP–GFP mice
(Nolte et al., 2001) and DCX–GFP mice (Gong et al., 2002), were
maintained at Medizinisch Theoretisches Zentrum, Technische
Universität Dresden, Germany. All experiments were conducted in
accordance with the applicable European and national regulations
(Tierschutzgesetz) and approved by the responsible authority
(Regierungspräsidium Dresden; approval number 24-9168.11-1/2012-
26). Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and
water providedad libitum.TgN3 WTand TgN3R169Cmice were genotyped
by PCR (Notch3 forward: 5′ TTC AGTGGTGGCGGGCGTC 3′ Notch3
reverse: 5′ GCCTACAGGTGCCACCATTA CGGC 3′; Vector forward: 5′
AACAGGAAGAATCGCAACGTTAAT 3′; Vector reverse: 5′AATGCA GCGA
TCAACGCCTTCTC 3′).
Notch3 PCR products from TgN3WT and TgN3R169C mice were
sequenced and the genetic mutation site was identified to confirm the
correct genotype of the strains used.
Female and male FVBN, TgN3WT and TgN3R169C mice received 3
intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-
Aldrich; 50 mg/kg), dissolved in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution and delivered
6 h apart at 28 days prior to killing. Mice were killed by an overdose of
ketamine and transcardial perfusion with 0.9% NaCl and 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). The brains were left in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C, transferred
to 30% sucrose and cut into 40 μm thick serial coronal sections on a
freezing microtome (Microm HM430, Thermo Scientific). Sections
were stored at−20°Cinacryoprotectant solution (25%ethyleneglycol,
25% glycerol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4).
Immunohistochemistry
As described previously (Kempermann et al., 2003), for BrdU detection
, every sixth brain section from FVBN, TgN3WT,TgN3 R169Cmice was
incubated in 2 N HCl for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were blocked with
TBS++(10% donkey serum, 0.2% Triton-X 100 in TBS) for 1 h and incubated
with monoclonal rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:500; OBT0030,
Serotec) in TBS+(3% donkey serum in TBS) overnight at 4 °C. For Ki67
detection ananalogous protocol was used, but without the HCl denaturing
step. Sections were incubated with primary rabbit anti-Ki67
antibody (1:500; NCL-Ki67p, Novacastra). To determine the total
number of labeled cells, the peroxidase method (Vectastain Elite ABC
Kit, Vector Laboratories) was used with biotinylated donkey anti-rat
antibody (1:500; Dianova) or anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; 711-065-
152, Dianova) and nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as a
chromogen. Stained sections were mounted on coated microscope
slides and cover-slipped with Neo-Mount (Merck). For immunofluorescence
, free-floating sections were washed, incubated in 2 N HCl for
30 min at 37 °C, if BrdU labeling was intended, blocked for 1 h in
TBS++ and incubated in primary antibody solution for 24 h at 4 °C.
The following antibodies were used: rat anti-BrdU (as above), mouse
anti-NeuN (1:250; MAB377, Millipore), S100β (1:1000; ab52642,
Abcam), mouse anti-Notch3 (1:20; 5E1, kindly provided by A. Joutel,
INSERM Paris, France), goat anti-GFP (1:500; R1091P, Acris), chicken
anti-GFAP (1:500; ab50738, Abcam), goat anti- Sox2 (1:500; sc-
17320, Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-NG2 (1:400; sc20162, Santa Cruz).
After primary incubation, sections were washed in TBS, followed by
secondary antibody incubation for 2 h at RT. All secondary antibodies
were purchased from Dianova: anti-goat Alexa 488, anti-mouse Dye
Light 549, anti-rabbit Cy3, anti-chicken Alexa 647, anti-goat Alexa 647,
anti-rabbit Alexa 647 and anti-rat Alexa 488. After a final wash step,
the sections were incubated for 10 min in Hoechst in TBS (1:4000;
33342, Sigma-Aldrich) washed again and mounted onto glass slides
using either Vectorshield mounting media (Vector laboratories) or
fluorescence mounting medium (Dako).
3DISCO
Three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared-organs (3DISCO)
described by Erturk et al. (2012) was used for hippocampal vessel
analysis. In order to label the vasculature mice were anesthetized and
injected with 2000 kDa FITC–Dextran (Sigma; 25 mg/ml dissolved in
0.9% NaCl) into the left ventricle of the heart. After 5 min mice were
perfused with 0.9% NaCl containing 10 U/ml heparin (MP Biomedicals),
followed by 4% PFA perfusion and 24 h postfixation in 4% PFA at 4 °C. To
minimize sample thickness only the left hemisphere was processed.
Samples were gradually cleared with tetrahydrofuran (THF, Sigma)
followed by three times 1 h dibenzylether (DBE, Sigma). Afterwards
samples were imaged immediately.
Image quantification
BrdU, Sox2 and Ki67 cell quantification were performed in coded
slides using conventional light microscopy under a Leica microscope
(DM 750, Leica). The number of immunopositive (+) cells present in
the SGZ of the DG was quantified by manually counting all DAB-
positive cells present within 40μm of the granular cell layer of the DG
formation (i.e. from Bregma−1.06 to Bregma−3.88). Fluorescence
images for BrdU phenotyping were obtained under a fluorescence
microscope (ApoTome.2, Zeiss). Images of Notch3 localization were
obtained under a confocal microscope (LSM 780 NLO, Zeiss).
3DISCO samples were imaged in DBE under an ultramicroscope (La
Vision BioTec) equipped with a chemical resistant reservoir, 2×
Olympus MVPLAPO objective and coherent sapphire 488 laser using a
z-step size of 6μm and ImSpector Version 4.0.311 software (La Vision
BioTec).
Images were processed with Zen software (Zeiss), Fiji and Illustrator
CS5 (Adobe). Only general contrast and color level adjustments were
made; otherwise images were not digitally manipulated. For 3D vessel
branching analysis the region of interest was isolated and batch processed

with “Tubeness”plugin (Sato et al., 1998)and“AnalyzeSkeleton”plugin
(Arganda-Carreras et al., 2010) from ImageJ (NIH software). For visualization
, Amira Software (FEI) was used for artificial color adjustment.
Electron microscopy
Female and male mice were perfused witch 0.9% NaCl followed by
Karnovsky's fixative (2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde,
20 mM HEPES). The brains were left in the Karnovsky solution overnight
followed by vibratome sectioning (Model 1200 Leica) at a thickness
of 200 μm. Tissue was contrasted for 2 h in 1% OsO
4
at 4 °C,
washed,en bloccontrasted with 1%uranyl acetatefor 2 h at4 °C,washed
and graduallydehydratedinethanol. This wasfollowedbyinfiltration of
Epon 812 resin, embedding in molds and polymerization at 60 °C for
24 h. Semithin sections were stained with 1% Toluidine Blue and 0.5%
Borax (TB/Borax) and inspected under a widefield microscope BZ
8000 (Keyence). Ultrathin 70 nm sections were analyzed under a transmission
electron microscope (Morgagni 268D, FEI).
Cell culture
Mice at 6 weeks of age (females and males) were anesthetized,
quickly decapitated and the dentate gyri were microdissected (Walker
and Kempermann, 2014). The tissue was enzymatically digested using
the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. For adherent cultures, the pellet was resuspended
in Neurobasal medium (NB, Gibco) with B27 supplement
(Gibco), 10 ng human-EGF (Peprotec), 10 ng human FGF2 (Peprotec)
and heparin (MP Biomedicals) and seeded into laminin-coated wells
(Babu et al., 2011). Cells were passagedfive times before stock was frozen
and characterized for the expression of Nestin and Sox-2. For a
neurosphere assay the same Neuronal Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi)
was used, but samples from each animal were treated separately. After
final centrifugation the cell pellets were resuspended in NB medium
with 20 ng EGF, 20 ng FGF2 and heparin seeded at clonal density into
a 96-well plate. For KCl activation, KCl was added to the medium at a
final concentration of 15 mM as described previously (Walker et al.,
2008). The neurosphere assay was analyzed 10 days after plating: the
spheres were counted and their diameters were determined under a
light microscope (CKX41, Olympus).
Differentiation of neural precursor cells
Adherent neural precursor cells of passage eight were grown in
laminin-coated dishes in DMEM with B27 and 10 ng/ml EGF and
10 ng/ml FGF2 for 2 days until 80% confluency was reached. They
were then changed to DMEM with B27 and only 5 ng/ml FGF2 and no
EGF for 2 days, after which all growth factors were withdrawn. During
the differentiation time course mRNA was isolated every 2 h for the
first 12 h followed by 12 h intervals.
Knock-down of Notch3 by siRNA
Adherent neural precursor cells of passage eight were transfected by
nucleofection (Nucleofector 2b, Lonza) with 300 nM Notch3 siRNA
(Origene) and seeded into the laminin-coated wells of a 96 E-well
plate (ACEA). Cell growth was measured in real time via changes in
electrical impedance with xCELLigence System (Roche). Eight wells
per condition were analyzed and the experiment was repeated five
times.
Immunocytochemistry
Hippocampal progenitor cells grown on coverslips werefixed with
methanol, washed twice with PBS, blocked for 1 h with 10% donkey
serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies
rabbit anti-intracellular Notch3 (1:500; ab23426, Abcam), goat anti-extracellular
Notch3 (1:500; sc32347, Santa Cruz) and mouse beta-actin
(1:500, sc-81178, Santa Cruz) in 3% donkey serum. The following day,
cells were washed three times for 10 min and incubated for 1 h with
donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488, anti-mouse DyLight 649 and antirabbit
Cy3.Coverslips were mounted inVectorshield (Vector) mounting
media.
mRNA analysis
Messenger RNA was isolated with TRI Reagent (Sigma). All samples
were digested with DNAse I (Invitrogen) before transcription into
cDNA with an iScript cDNA Kit (Biorad, Germany) and amplification
with the SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Biorad) in a real time PCR system
(CFX96, Biorad). The following primers were used: Notch3 (forward:
TGA GTGTCCAGCTGGCTATG, reverse: CACAGGTGCCATTGTGTAGG),
Notch1 (forward: CCAGCATGG CCAGCTCTGG, reverse: CATCCAGATCTG
TGGCC) and GAPDH (forward: ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG, reverse:
CACATTGGGGGTA GGAACAC).
Western blot
Brain samples and cultured precursor cells were homogenized in an
ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCL, 1% NP-40, 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor
mix (cOmplete, Roche). Protein extracts of 40μg were separated in
4–12% gradient gels (Abcam) by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes.Membranes were blocked with 5%milk and incubated with rabbit anti-Notch3 antibody (1: 500; ab23426,Abcam)or rabbit
anti Notch1 (1:500; 04-1046, Millipore) and mouse anti-GAPDH
(1:500; ABS16, Millipore) or mouse anti-Vinculin (V9131, Sigma) in
TBS with 1% BSA over night at 4 °C. Secondary antibody donkey antimouse
IRDye 800CW (1:10 000; 926-68072, Li-Cor,) and donkey antirabbit
IRDye 680CW (1:10 000; 926-68073, Li-Cor) were incubated in
TBS for 30 min. Plots were scanned on an infrared scanner (Odyssey,
Li-Cor) and analyzed for Notch3 and Notch1 expression.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 10 (SAS). All data
were analyzed by one-way-ANOVA using Tukey's least significant
difference as a post hoc test, except the Notch3 knockdown assay,
which was analyzed using paired Student's t-test. Data are presented
infigures as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
GOM deposits and vascular alterations in the hippocampus of CADASIL
transgenic mice
Ourfirst goal was to analyze whether GOM deposits, as a hallmark
of vascular deficits in CADASIL (Ruchoux et al., 1995; Ebke
et al., 1997), can also be found in the hippocampus. Electron microscopy
revealed the accumulation of GOMs in the basement membrane
of vSMC in arterioles of the hippocampalfissure in 14-month-old
TgN3R169C mice (Figs. 1A–A″). In the subgranular zone of the DG,
the site of adult neurogenesis, only capillaries containing pericytes
instead of vSMCs could be found (Fig. S1). Consistent with the
concept that GOMs are limited to vSMCs, no GOMs were detected
in vessels of the SGZ (Fig. S1). Thus, CADASIL led to structural deficits
in arterioles of the hippocampus but did not result in structural
abnormalities in capillaries of the SGZ.
We next investigated whether the vascular network in the hippocampus
might be altered as consequence of the mutation. Given the
many technical problems associated with quantitative measurements
133 F. Ehret et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 75 (2015) 131–141
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
of the vasculature from tissue sections, we applied 3D imaging of
solvent-cleared brain hemispheres (3DISCO) combined with FITC–
Dextran injection to label the blood vessels (Erturk et al., 2012).
Automated analysis of the vascular network in the hippocampus
of 17-month-old transgenic animals (processing steps are illustrated
in Figs. 1 B–B″) revealed no de ficits in the number of branches
[F
(2,20)
= 0.28; p = 0.753] (Fig. 1C), junctions [F
(2,20)
= 0.63; 
p = 0.54] (Fig. 1D) and average branch lengths [F
(2,20)
= 0.51; 
p = 0.605] ( Fig. 1E). These results suggested that despite the
presence of GOMs in the hippocampal fissure the vascular network
of the hippocampus was not affected in mice carrying the CADASIL
mutation.
Altered adult neurogenesis in CADASIL transgenic mice
Immunohistochemical analysis of BrdU incorporation at 4 weeks
after injection was carried out to assess adult neurogenesis. At 1 year
of age, when GOM deposits can be found throughout the brain but not
in the niche of DG, we observed a significant ~50% reduction in the
number of BrdU+ cells in the DG of TgN3WT and TgN3R169C mice
compared to WT mice [F
(2,29)
= 4.72; p = 0.017 with WT N TgN3WT
p = 0.042 and WT N TgN3R169C p = 0.027] (Fig. 2B). However, there
was no difference in BrdU+ cells between TgN3R169C and TgN3WT
mice. To identify whether these alterations can already be found at an
earlier age, at which no GOM deposits and vascular abnormalities
have been reported in this mouse model (Joutel et al., 2010), we
analyzed mice at 6 months of age. TgN3WT mice showed significantly
reduced numbers of BrdU+ cells compared to TgN3R169Cand presumably
also to WT mice (but here p = 0.092) [F
(2,24)
= 6.22; p = 0.006
with TgN3R169CN TgN3WTp=0.005]( Fig. 2C). Double-labeled BrdU+/
NeuN+ cells were analyzed to determine neuronal differentiation and
calculate the net outcome of neurogenesis. Even though the percentage
of neuronal differentiation was not altered in TgN3WTor TgN3R169Cmice
compared to WT mice and ~57% of newborn cells became neurons
[F
(1,27)
= 0.078 p = 0.925] (Fig. 2D), net neurogenesis was increased
in CADASIL mice at 6 months of age [ANOVA F
(2,23)
= 3.89 p = 0.035
with TgN3R169C N TgN3WT p = 0.027] (Fig. 2E). Thus, TgN3R169C mice
had 1.8 times more new neurons than transgenic controls. Double
labeling for BrdU and S100β to determine the rate of astrocytic
differentiation revealed an increased percentage of BrdU+/S100β+
cells in TgN3WT (11.2%) mice compared to WT (4.2%) and TgN3R169C
(4.2%) mice [F

p = 0.005 with TgN3WT N WT p = 0.022 and TgN3WTNTgN3R169Cp=
0.008] (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that adult neurogenesis in
CADASIL is altered independent of overt vascular pathology.
Notch3 is expressed in the hippocampal stem cell niche and by isolated
precursor cells
To determine whether these alterations in adult neurogenesis might
be due to the direct effects of the mutation on precursor cell function,
we analyzed the expression pattern of Notch3 in more detail. Immunohistochemical
analysis during hippocampal development disclosed that
Notch3 was expressed at high levels throughout the hippocampus at prenatal
stages (Figs. 3A–A′). During early postnatal stages Notch3
expression became restricted and was expressed at higher levels in the
newly forming molecular layer (Figs. 3B–B′). After postnatal day 7
Notch3 expression was increasingly restricted to the vasculature and
the proliferating precursor cells (Figs. 3C–C′, S1). During adult stages (at
6 weeks of age) Notch3 was highly expressed in vSMC of arterioles in
the hippocampal fissure (Figs. 3D–D1). In the hippocampal stem cell
niche, immunohistochemistry revealed an expression of Notch3 on the
surface of NG2+ pericytes, Nestin-GFP+ precursor cells (Figs. 3D2,
G) and DCX-GFP+ precursor cells and immature neurons (Fig. 3F) but
not on GFAP+astrocytes outside the niche (Fig. 3E). This distribution of
Notch3 expression in precursor cells and maturing neurons in addition
to its presence in the wall of blood vessels would be consistent with a possible
direct influence of Notch3 on the regulation of adult neurogenesis.
The expression of Notch3 in neural precursor cells could also be
confirmedin vitro. Immunocytochemical analysis of isolated hippocampal
neural precursor cells from adult WT mice, which all express Nestin
and Sox2 (Fig. 3H), revealed the expression of Notch3 intra and extracellular
domains at the cell membrane (Fig. 3I). Further, we found a
high protein expression of the intracellular domain of Notch3 and
Notch1 in cultured hippocampal precursor cells compared to tissue
samples from mouse cortex, hippocampal fissure, and dentate gyrus
(Fig. 3J). Analysis of mRNA expression during the time course of
in vitro differentiation of hippocampal precursor cells into neurons
and astrocytes revealed that Notch3 and Notch1 expression increased
gradually over the first 48 h before it declined again (Fig. 3K). These
results confirmed that isolated hippocampal precursor cells show
Notch3 expression especially at the stage roughly corresponding to
the time when the cells exit the cell cycle and start to differentiate.
Notch3 regulates cell proliferation
To determine whether Notch3 regulates adult neurogenesis by cell
autonomous influence, we analyzed cell proliferation in Notch3 knockdown
and Notch3 overexpressing isolated neural precursor cells.
TgN3WT cells proliferated significantly less in vitro than WT and
TgN3R169Ccells, based on the quantification of BrdU+ cells after 2 h of
BrdU incubation [F
(2,17)
= 10.69 p = 0.01 with WT N TgN3WT p=
0.01; TgN3R169CN TgN3WTpb 0.03] (Fig. 4A). Further, siRNA mediated
knockdown of Notch3 in neuronal precursor cells was used to assess
the effects on cell growth in real time with the xCELLigence system.
After 24 h of siRNA treatment a knock-down efficiency of ~75% was
reached (Fig. 4B), which resulted in reduced Notch3 protein expression
after 48 h (Fig. 4C). The xCELLigence system was used to assess cell
growth in real time through associated changes in electrical impedance
(Fig. 4D). SiRNA treated cells showed a significant increase in the slope
of the cell growth curve (between 48 h and 70 h post transfection)
compared to scrambled treated controls [paired t-test t
(6)
=2,36;p=
0.027] (Figs. 4E–F). These results confirmed a direct Notch3-
dependent regulation of cell proliferation in isolated neural precursor
cells from the adult dentate gyrus.
We confirmed thesein vitroresultsin vivoby immunohistochemical
analysis of cell proliferation marker Ki67 in the SGZ at the ages of 6
months and 1 year. The number of Ki67+ cells in the dentate gyrus
was reduced in TgN3WTcompared to TgN3R169Cbut not in WT mice at
6 months [F
(1,26)
= 3.41; p = 0.048 with TgN3R169C N TgN3WT p=
0.039] (Figs. 5A–B). At 1 year, there was a significant reduction in the
number of Ki67+ cells in sections from TgN3R169C mice compared to
WT mice but not in TgN3WT mice compared to WT mice [F
(1,29)
=
4.34; p = 0.022 with WT N TgN3R169C p = 0.017] (Figs. 5C–D). These

results further support the hypothesis of a direct regulation of cell
proliferation by Notch3 in neural precursor cells.
To investigate possible deficits in the stem and precursor cell pools
of the SGZ, immunohistochemical analysis of Sox2 as key transcription
factor expressed by the stem and progenitor cells (Ellis et al., 2004),
was carried out in 1-year-old transgenic mice. However, we found no
alterations in the number of Sox2+ cells in neither TgN3R169C nor
TgN3WT mice compared to WT controls [F
(2,30)
= 0.003; p = 0.99]
(Figs. 5E–F). This suggested that the size of the stem and precursor
cell pools is not altered in Notch3 and CADASIL transgenic mice and it
is indeed the proliferative activity of the precursor cells that is affected.
Notch3 suppresses neurosphere formation and stem cell activation
To further support the direct regulatory impact of Notch3 signaling
on stem and precursor cell proliferation and maintenance we used our
version of the classical neurosphere assay as an indicator of precursor
cell maintenance (Walker et al., 2008; Azari et al., 2010). At an early
adult age of 6 weeks, when no vascular deficits are present (Joutel
et al., 2010), the number of neurospheres was significantly reduced in
preparations from TgN3WT and TgN3R169C mice compared to WT
controls [F
(2,14)
= 34.99; p b 0.001 with WT N TgN3WT p b 0.001 and
WT N TgN3R169C p b 0.001] (Fig. 6A). This indicates that WT Notch3
overexpression has a similar impact on neurosphere formation than
on precursor proliferation in adherent cultures. Interestingly, the
TgN3R169C and TgN3WT samples showed the same reduction in
neurosphere formation.
Activation of precursor cells ex vivo by treatment with 15 mM KCl
(Walker et al., 2008), revealed that neurosphere size did not increase
in TgN3WT preparations, whereas, preparations from WT and
TgN3R169C mice showed an increased neurosphere size after activation.
For the analysis we counted the number of spheres formed in the
preparation for KCl activation vs. unactivated for small (40–70 μm)
medium (70–90 μm) (Fig. 6C) and large size spheres (≥100 μm)
(Fig. 6D). Differences were found in TgN3R169C and WT samples in
medium spheres [F
(2,15)
= 4.46; p b 0.005 with TgN3R169C N TgN3WT
p b 0.05] and large spheres ≥100 μm [F 
(2,15)
= 15.12; p b 0.005
with WT N TgN3WT p b 0.005 and TgN3R169C N TgN3WT p b 0.05]
(Fig. 6B). This surprising observation indicated that even though
TgN3R169C samples showed a reduction in the number of primary
neurospheres they increased sphere size after depolarizing activation.
Taken together these results highlight that Notch3 overexpression
impairs stem and progenitor cell division but not the stem cell pool.
Second, the CADASIL mutation had no impact on the progenitor pool
size or maintenance; it rather resulted in a loss of Notch3 function in
respect to precursor cell activation.
Discussion
The present study revealed that adult neurogenesis is altered in a
mouse model of CADASIL. We describe a novel cell autonomous effect
of Notch3 signaling on hippocampal precursor cells. We showed that
Notch3 overexpression suppressed precursor cell activation and proliferation
and directed these cells towards an astrocytic fate. In CADASIL
mice these Notch3 functions are partially impaired, resulting in altered
activation and increased proliferation of hippocampal precursor cells in
early adulthood.
In contrast to what is commonly thought, Notch3 is not only
expressed in vSMC and pericytes but also in neural precursor cells of
the adult hippocampus. In line with the data presented by Irvin et al
(2001), we detected increased Notch3 receptor expression throughout
the developing dentate gyrus during the prenatal stages and increasingly
more restricted expression during the early postnatal stages. The
dentate gyrus is built in an outside-in fashion, where the outer granular
layer is formed prior to the inner layer (Altman and Bayer, 1990). Since
Notch3 was dominantly expressed in the “older”outer molecular layer
until postnatal day 7, Notch3 possibly plays a role in the maturation of
granule cells.
Further analysis at later ages confirmed that Notch3 and Notch1
might be co-expressed in proliferating hippocampal precursor cells.
We found that Notch3 plays a direct role in the proliferation of hippocampal
stem and precursor cells. But while Notch1 is essential for
progenitor pool maintenance and regulation of proliferation (Stump
et al., 2002; Breunig et al., 2007; Lugert et al., 2010) we could show
that Notch3 suppresses stem cell proliferation, impairs neurosphere
formation and inhibitsex vivostem cell activation. Ourfindings suggest
that Notch3 might act as a suppressor of stem cell activity and decreases
precursor cell proliferation without affecting precursor cell numbers. In
contrast, overexpression and conditional knock-out experiments have
shown that Notch1 signaling is necessary for precursor cell selfrenewal
(Breunig et al., 2007). We further saw, duringin vitrodifferentiation
of hippocampal precursor cells, that the mRNAs of Notch1 and
Notch3 were co-expressed and gradually decreased after ~48 h when
the cells stopped proliferating. Thus, it is possible that both intracellular
domains interact with the same targets but compete for binding sites.
Beatus and colleagues have suggested that in adulthood Notch3 acts
as a repressor and Notch1 as an activator of Hes target genes (2001).

Thus, our working hypothesis is that stem cell activation and proliferation
depend on a fine-tuned interplay between Notch1 and Notch3
binding to RBPJκ, resulting in either activation or inhibition of Hes
transcription that activates cell proliferation. To further follow this
idea was not the subject of the present study, which focused on the
CADASIL mutation and its potential effect on adult neurogenesis.
In the used mouse model (Joutel et al., 2010), the CADASIL mutation
resulted in a loss of Notch3 function in hippocampal precursor cells.
Precursor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro was increased in
CADASIL transgenic mice compared to Notch3 overexpression controls
but unchanged in comparison to WT mice. A similar pattern was seen
for astrocytic differentiation at 6 months of age. These results suggest
a loss of Notch3 function in hippocampal precursor cells as a result of
the mutation.
Previous studies on CADASIL models have come to equivocal
conclusions on whether the CADASIL mutation results in gain- or lossof-function
effects (Donahue and Kosik, 2004; Arboleda-Velasquez
et al., 2011; Cognat et al., 2014). The discrepancies might be due to
the effects of different specific mutations and the region of analysis.
Further studies will have to show whether all CADASIL mutations
have similar effects on adult neural precursor cells.
With the gained insight into Notch3 function and dysfunction in
hippocampal precursor cells, the observed alterations in adult
neurogenesis in CADASIL mice fall into place. At 6 months, adult
neurogenesis was increased compared to Notch3 overexpressing controls
because of a presumed loss of Notch3 function. At this age no deficits
in microcirculation or the vascular network have been reported
(Joutel et al., 2010). Therefore, it is likely that only the direct impact of
reduced Notch3 signaling influenced adult neurogenesis. At 12 months
of age, two independent mechanisms might alter adult hippocampal
neurogenesis. On one hand the cell intrinsic deficits in Notch3 signaling
would still be effective, but on the other hand the increasing load of
GOM accumulation in arteries of the hippocampal fissure and other
previously observed vascular and microcirculatory deficits might
compromise the vascular niche and exert secondary effects on adult
neurogenesis. About the extent of such secondary effects, if they exist,
we can only speculate. But at a later time the levels of adult
neurogenesis in CADASIL mice were as low as in ##the Notch3 overexpressing
controls. This might indicate that at a more advanced age adult
neurogenesis in CADASIL might be additionally altered due to vascular
deficits caused by the degeneration of vSMC and pericytes. However,
yet other unknown mechanisms cannot be excluded at this time.
For the analysis of neurogenesis function and hippocampal deficits
this CADASIL model has some limitations. Whereas earlier transgenic
models did not develop brain lesions (Ruchoux et al., 2003;
Monet-Lepretre et al., 2009), the TgN3R169Cmodel has been thefirst to
show nearly all neuropathological signs of CADASIL pathology and has
been extremely useful for identifying the critical roles of Notch3 in
vascular maturation as well (Joutel et al., 2010; Joutel, 2011;
Monet-Lepretre et al., 2013; Cognat et al., 2014). However, since
Notch3 overexpression by itself impaired precursor cell proliferation,
it is difficult to draw clear conclusions about the loss of function deficits
in CADASIL overexpressing mice. A knock-in mouse model would be
critical to make stronger statements about hippocampal dysfunction
in CADASIL. Unfortunately, most of these models do not develop vascular
dysfunction or cerebral pathology (Lundkvist et al., 2005; Wallays
et al., 2011).
At present the shortage of optimized animal models of CADASIL
complicates advancing from speculations about a plausible diseaserelated
biological process to the actual pathology itself, which is more
complexthantheapparently simple mechanism of vasculardysfunction
or even impaired neural precursor cell function suggested. The
characteristic migraine found in many patients, for example, has no
counterpart in animal models. For cognitive and affective symptoms,
in contrast, a hypothetical, although not exclusive, link to adult
neurogenesis can be made and potentially be further explored. The
concept, however, remains reductionistic.
Our results nevertheless suggest that pathogenic mechanisms might
exist in CADASIL that depend on cell types other than smooth muscle
cells and possibly other vascular cells, thus adding to the complexity
of the pathology. Our perspective has been biased here to adult hippocampal
neurogenesis, because a plausible theoretical link could be
made between Notch3 dysfunction and impaired adult neurogenesis.
How exactly impaired adult neurogenesis might contribute to the
pathogenesis and course of CADASIL remains to be investigated. In
addition, there might yet be other functions of Notch3 in the adult
brain, including other precursor cell populations, which might be
altered in CADASIL.
Irrespective of these considerations, the results from the present
study are afirst step towards a more comprehensive understanding of
Notch3 dysfunction in CADASIL, which to date was limited to a vascular
perspective. The proposed direct deficits in the regulation of adult
neurogenesis, might give a new potential explanation for the memory
deficits foundinCADASILpatients priorto whitematter changes. Specific
clinical studies focusing on memory phenotypes associated with the
function of the adult-generated neurons (Garthe et al., 2009, 2014)
will have to verify if the expected memory deficits indeed exist in
CADASIL patients.
In summary, Notch3 is expressed in proliferating hippocampal
precursor cells where it down-regulates precursor cell activation and

proliferation, suggesting a balancing effect to Notch1. Further, we
showed that adult neurogenesis in CADASIL transgenicmicewas altered
prior to vascular abnormalities due to cell intrinsic deficits in Notch3
signaling. Thus, the results from this study give a new perspective of
an additional vascular independent mechanism for the manifestation
of memory deficits in CADASIL.
