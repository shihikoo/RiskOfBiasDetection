Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning is a
powerful neuroprotective phenomenon by which an injurious
stimulus renders the brain resistant to a subsequent damaging
ischemic insult. The LPS response gene (Lrg) is a recently
identified gene in human dental pulp cells treated with LPS.
However, the role and mechanism of Lrg in brain ischemia
injury have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we sought to
determine whether Lrg participates in LPS preconditioninginduced
brain ischemia injury. The Lrg protein accumulates in
brain tissue after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Furthermore, knockdown of Lrg by small interfering RNA
(siRNA) significantly increased the infarct size of brain injury.
In addition, we investigated the mechanism of Lrg in brain
ischemia injury. Lrg-siRNA could regulate inflammatory cytokine
expression. Moreover, interleukin-1 receptorassociated
kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and nuclear factor Kappa B
(NF-κB) p65 protein levels were significantly increased by
Lrg-siRNA in mice after MCAO. Conversely, interferon regulatory
factor 3 (IRF3) protein level was decreased by LrgsiRNA.
Taken together, these results suggest that Lrg regulates
the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS
preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury via the tolllike
receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. Lrg may therefore
serve as a novel therapeutic target for brain ischemia injury.

Introduction
Ischemic brain injury is a major public health problem. It is
often caused by a transient or permanent reduction of cerebral
occlusions. It leads to serious and complex pathophysiological
changes affecting multiple levels of the brain and sports a high
global mortality rate as the leading cause of neurological
disability (Loane and Faden 2010; Yilmaz and Granger
2010). In the past several decades, extensive research has
focused on the prevention and treatment of ischemic brain
injury. Thrombolytic therapy designed to restore cerebral perfusion
is considered the main rational therapeutic strategy for
ischemic brain injury. However, reperfusion after thrombolytic
therapy often leads to a series of cellular, biochemical, and
metabolic consequences of cerebral ischemia, including intracellular
reactive oxygen species generation, calcium overload,
excitotoxic cell injury, and inflammation, which ultimately
lead to irreversible brain injury (Albers et al. 2001).
In recent years, numerous studies related to brain protection
have focused especially on ischemic preconditioning, which is
a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia have been
shown to protect the myocardium against a more sustained
ischemic insult (Gross and Peart 2003). Research on preconditioning
, also known as induced tolerance, has resulted in
various promising strategies for the treatment of patients with
brain injury. Although ischemic preconditioning is an effective
strategy to prevent brain ischemic injury, it is difficult to
apply in clinical trials. Therefore, seeking new and effective
therapy, such as nonischemic preconditioning strategy, to
prevent/treat ischemic injury is of importance.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning is a powerful
neuroprotective phenomenon by which an injurious stimulus

renders the brain resistant to a subsequent damaging ischemic
insult. Hichey et al. reported that LPS-induced preconditioning
is a robust neuroprotective phenomenon in the ischemic
developing brain that is age dependent (Hickey et al. 2011).
Vartanian et al. reported that LPS preconditioning alters the
response to injury in the brain and the blood in a manner that
promotes a protective phenotype (Vartanian et al. 2011).
The LPS response gene (Lrg) is a recently identified
gene in human dental pulp cells treated with LPS. Previous
studies have shown that the expression level of Lrg in
HepG2 cells was remarkably upregulated by the irritation
of LPS; HepG2 cells were markedly arrested in the G1
phase by overexpression of Lrg, and the percentage of
HepG2 cells in the G1 phase partly decreased after Lrgsmall
interfering RNA (siRNA) (Du et al.2008). However,
the role and mechanism of Lrg in brain ischemic injury have
not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In this study, we examined Lrg expression in LPS-
preconditioned mice following cerebral ischemic injury. Furthermore
, we investigated the mechanism of Lrg in brain
ischemic injury. Our results suggest that Lrg is upregulated
in LPS-preconditioned mice following cerebral ischemic injury
and that Lrg mediates gene expression of inflammatory
cytokines in LPS preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury
via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. Understanding
the endogenous signaling events that promote
protection against ischemic injury is integral to the identification
and development of novel brain ischemic injury
therapeutics.
Methods
Animals and LPS Preconditioning
Forty C57BL/6 mice (male, 8–12 weeks) were randomly
divided into four groups of ten each: saline-wild-type (WT)
group, LPS-WT group, saline-Lrg-siRNA group, and LPSLrg-siRNA
group. All mice were housed at an ambient temperature
of 24±1 °C and were provided with free access to
food and water. For the in vivo study, mice were given an
intraperitoneal injection of saline or LPS (0.2 mg/kg), 72 h
prior to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Animal experiments conformed to the guidelines issued by
the Institute of General Hospital of Chengdu Military Area
Command for Laboratory Animals. The present study was
performed with approval from the Animal Ethics Committee
of the Institute of General Hospital of Chengdu Military
Area Command (certification no. 0145). All surgeries were
performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and all efforts were made to minimize
suffering. Two mice died during MCAO in the saline-LrgsiRNA
group.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Focal ischemia was induced using a modified monofilament
suture method described previously (Stevens et al.
2002). Briefly, mice were anesthetized, then a siliconecoated
7-0 monofilament nylon surgical suture was
threaded through the external carotid artery to the internal
carotid artery to block the middle cerebral artery, and
maintained intraluminally for 60 min. Then, the suture
was removed to restore blood flow.
Lrg-siRNATransfection
Lentivirus-mediated siRNA constructs were designed by
Shanghai Genechem (Shanghai, China). The sequences corresponding
to the siRNA of Lrg were sense 5′-TCG ACG
CTC TTC AGA CAT AAA GGATTC GTC CTT TCT GTC
TGA AGA GCT TTT T-3′and antisense 5′-CTA GAA AAA
GCT CTT CAG ACA GAA AGG ACG AAT CCT TTC TGT
CTG AAG AGC G-3′. For in vitro transfection, neuron cells
were seeded in each well of 24-well microplates, grown for
24 h to reach 50 % confluence, and incubated with a
mixture of 6 pmol siRNA-Lrg plus 1 μl Lipofectamine
RNAi-MAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 100 μlserumfree
medium at 37 °C in 5 % CO
2
. For in vivo transfection,
5μl of siRNAwas mixed with 20μl of HiPerFect transfection
reagent (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and 75 μl of 
Ringer’s solution. An injection of 100 μl siRNA preparations
was injected into the tail vein of mice before MCAO
(Jiao et al. 2013).
Brain Infarction Measurement
After 90 min of MCAO and 12 h of reperfusion, mice were
anesthetized with 4 % isoflurane; brains were removed and
sectioned coronally at a thickness of 2 mm and then incubated
in 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for 20 min. Brain slices
were then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight.
The posterior surface of each brain slice was photographed
and analyzed using a digital image analysis system (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO). The infarct area in each brain slice was 
calculated as the difference between the contralateral hemispheric
area and the noninfarct ipsilateral hemispheric area
and expressed in square millimeters. Infarct area was
assessed by the following formula: infarct area=contralateral
hemispheric area/(contralateral hemispheric area+
noninfarct ipsilateral hemispheric area)×100 %.
Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the RNA plus kit (Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Two micrograms of total RNA from

(TRIAL VER. PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.13877971)
mouse brain tissue was primed with Oligo dT primer and
reverse transcribed using the AMV Reverse Transcription
System (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The levels of gene
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were analyzed by using
the specific primers, SYBR Green I reagent, and the RT-PCR
kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, on Bio-Rad
iQ5 Quantitative PCR System (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan).
The specific primers for Lrg were sense, 5′-AAG GTA CCA
TGA AAC AGC AAG AAG TAC AAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-
AAA GCT TCA CAT CAA GGA ACC ATC GTC-3′, and for
β-actin were sense, 5′-AAATCG TGC GTG ACATCA AAG
A-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGC CAT CTC CTG CT CGAA-3′.
Briefly, 20-μl reactions containing 50 ng of total RNA, 10μl
2× SYBR Green I reagent, 6.25 U MultiScribe reverse transcriptase
, 10 U RNase inhibitor, and 0.1 mM primers were
subjected to one cycle at 94 °C for 10 min and then 40 cycles
at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40s. Results
were normalized to β-actin expression. Then, the relative
quantification of the gene of interest was determined by using
the comparativeΔCt method.
Western Blotting
Brain tissues from MCAO mice were harvested for western
blot analysis. The brain tissues were placed in seven volumes
of cold homogenization buffer (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
1 % Triton X-100) to which a cocktail of protease inhibitors
had been freshly added. Brain tissues were then homogenized
and centrifuged, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C
until determination of the total protein concentration using a
BCA protein assay kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). For
western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell, Middlesex
, UK). After blocking, the target proteins were probed
with primary antibody (anti-nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB)
p65, anti-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1),
and anti-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or β-actin)
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Then, the blots
were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated
secondary antibody. Protein-antibody complexes
were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence western
blotting detection system according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (GE, Orsay, France). β-actin was used as internal
control.
Inflammatory Cytokine Analysis
Analysis of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL6) and antiinflammatory
cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10) was performed
on brain tissue using a commercially available ELISA kit
(Aviscera Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer’sinstructions.
Statistical Analysis
All results are reported as means±SD. Multiple comparisons
were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
test. Two-group comparisons were analyzed by Student’s
t test. P<0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results
LPS Induced the Lrg Expression in Mouse Brain Tissue
To investigate the role of Lrg in brain ischemia injury, we
examined the response to LPS relevant to brain ischemic
injury in mouse brain tissue. As shown in Fig. 1, RT-PCR 
results showed that the Lrg mRNA level was significantly
increased by LPS treatment, as compared with the control
group. And, elevation of Lrg mRNA level by LPS was timedependent
, beginning at 3 h and peaking at around 12 h
(*P<0.05). Furthermore, western blot analysis showed an
initial increase of Lrg protein level in injured than in salinetreated
brain tissue within the first 2 h, then an increase at 6 to
12 h after injury, with maximal expression at 12 h. These
results suggested that LPS could elevate the Lrg expression.

Lrg Knockdown by siRNA Exacerbates the Brain Ischemia
Injury
To confirm whether Lrg is involved in LPS preconditioninginduced
tolerance to brain ischemia injury, we subjected LrgsiRNA
mice to reversible MCAO. As shown in Fig. 2, LPSWT
significantly reduced, by 43 %, the infract size of brain
injury as compared with saline-WT at 12 h after injury. And,
the infract size of saline-Lrg-siRNA mice was significantly
increased as compared with saline-WT. In addition, LPS-LrgsiRNA
could increase the infract size as compared with LPSWTand
decrease the infract size as compared with saline-LrgsiRNA
(*P<0.05). These results suggested that Lrg is involved
in LPS preconditioning-induced tolerance to brain
ischemia injury.
Lrg Knockdown by siRNA Regulates Inflammatory Cytokine
Expression
Brain ischemic injury is accompanied by inflammatory responses
, which induce production of proinflammatory cytokines.
Therefore, we examined the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines (TNF-α and IL6) and anti-inflammatory
cytokine (IL10) in the ischemic brain of the saline-WT, LPSWT
, and LPS-Lrg-siRNA mice after MCAO using ELISA.
The results demonstrated that at 0 h after MCAO, there was no
significant difference in the levels of IL6, TNF-α, and IL10
among the three groups. Also, at 6 h after MCAO, the level of
IL6 and TNF-α was significantly enhanced in saline, LPS-
preconditioned, and LPS-Lrg-siRNA mice compared with
that at 0 h after MCAO. However, at 12 h after MCAO, the
levels of IL6 and TNF-α were decreased in the three groups,
and they were higher in LPS-Lrg-siRNA mice than that of
LPS-preconditioned mice (*P<0.05) (Fig.3a, b). Meanwhile,
there was no obvious difference in IL10 level of the saline
group at 0, 6, and 12 h after MCAO. At 12 h after MCAO, the
level of IL10 was lower in LPS-Lrg-siRNA mice than that of
LPS-preconditioned mice (*P<0.05) (Fig. 3c). These results
suggested that Lrg knockdown by siRNA could regulate
inflammatory cytokine expression.

Lrg Knockdown by siRNA Regulates Inflammatory Cytokine
Expression via TLR4 Signaling Pathway
TLR4 plays a crucial role in modulating the inflammatory
response caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion via
linking to its endogenous ligand LPS (Wang et al. 2013).
Therefore, we examined the expression of IRAK-1, NF-κB
p65, and IRF3 associated with TLR4 signaling to understand
the mechanism underlying the increased inflammatory response
of Lrg-siRNA mice after brain ischemia. As shown
in Fig. 4, as compared with WT, IRAK-1, and NF-κBp65,
protein levels were significantly increased by Lrg-siRNA in
mice after MCAO. Meanwhile, IRF3 protein level was decreased
by Lrg-siRNA. These results suggested that Lrg regulates
the expression of inflammatory cytokines via the TLR4
signaling pathway.
Discussion
Brain injury caused by cerebral ischemia/perfusion is a complicated
pathological course, in which inflammatory responses
play a crucial role (Allen et al. 2003). Numerous
studies showed a detrimental effect of the postischemic inflammatory
reaction (Frantz et al. 2009;Sieberetal.2011;
Pérez-de-Puig et al. 2013). Therefore, therapeutic strategies
targeting the delayed inflammatory response could inhibit the
progression of the brain damage providing an extended
therapeutic window for neuroprotection. In this study, we
demonstrated that Lrg expression level was induced in LPS-
preconditioned mice following cerebral ischemic injury. Furthermore
, the levels of TNF-α and IL6 were significantly
increased, and IL10 was significantly upregulated in the brain
tissue following MCAO of LPS-Lrg-siRNA-preconditioned
mice. We also showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of Lrg
depends, at least in part, on the TLR signaling pathway.
Preconditioning can protect the brain either almost immediately
after stimulation or with a delay of 1 to 3 days to
induce protein-synthesis-dependent protection (Dirnagl et al.
2009). A recent study demonstrated that a series of repetitive
hypoxic preconditioning stimuli can induce neuroprotection
in the retina that lasts many weeks (Zhu et al. 2007). In this
study, LPS, a specific ligand of TLR4, was used as a preconditioning
inducer to study the effect of Lrg on LPS-
preconditioned mice following cerebral ischemic injury.
Previous studies suggested that cerebral ischemia dramatically
alters the protein and gene expression profile (Smith
et al.2004;Tangetal.2006). It was reported that the ischemic
brain increasesβ-secretase activity in the parenchyma with a
concomitant overexpression of amyloid precursor protein;
also, the ischemic brain shows increased expression of
presenilin 1 and nicastrin in glial cells, both of which are
elements of the γ-secretase complex (Pluta et al. 2013). In
addition, one study reported that monocyte chemotactic
protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) can be significantly induced
in human and mouse microglia and mouse brain with

LPS preconditioning, and that MCPIP1 gene expression significantly
increased in the mouse brain after MCAO (Liang
et al.2011). In this study, we found that LPS induced the Lrg
expression in mouse brain tissue following ischemic injury. In
addition, there was a much larger ischemic brain infarct area in
LPS-Lrg-siRNA mice after MCAO. Therefore, we conclude
that Lrg is involved in LPS preconditioning-induced ischemic
injury and that Lrg may play an important role in protecting
against ischemic brain injury.
The inflammatory response significantly contributes to
ischemic brain injury. TNF-α and IL6 are two of the most
well-known cytokines involved in the inflammatory response
elicited in the region of cerebral ischemia (Ziebell and
Morganti-Kossmann 2010), while IL10 is a potent antiinflammatory
cytokine that plays a crucial role in preventing
inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies (Ouyang et al.
2011). In the present study, we found that Lrg-siRNA robustly
elevated the level of TNF-α and IL6 in the brain tissue.
Moreover, the level of IL10 was significantly decreased by
Lrg-siRNA. The findings are consistent with other investigations
, which have demonstrated that the levels of IL6 and IL-
1β were increased in cerebral vessels following transient
ischemia (Haqqani et al. 2005). We found that the expression
of TNF-α, IL6, and IL10 was changed, which suggested that
the production and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines
correlate with the events occurring after brain ischemic injury.
These results show that Lrg exerts neuroprotective effects via
regulating cerebral inflammatory cytokines.
Accumulating investigations demonstrate that TLRs are
activated by endogenous proteins released from the damaged
brain and play a crucial role in mediating cerebral injury
following ischemia and reperfusion (Kaczorowski et al.
2008). In this study, we adopted IRAK-1, NF-κBp65,and
IRF3 associated with TLR4 signaling to determine the effect
of Lrg on brain ischemic injury. These results indicate that the
siRNA-Lrg could upregulate the expression level of IRAK-1
and NF-κB. Meanwhile, the IRF3 protein level was decreased
by siRNA-Lrg. The detrimental effect of TLR signaling is
associated with the pathways that lead to NF-κB activation
and proinflammatory responses. In contrast, TLR signaling
pathways that activate IRFs can induce anti-inflammatory
mediators and type I IFNs that have been associated with
neuroprotection (Vartanian et al. 2011). These results suggest
that TLR4 signaling may be a mechanism underlying the
excessive generation of proinflammatory cytokines after brain
ischemic injury. TLR2 was also found to be important in the
pathological progression of cerebral injury (Chao2009; Wang
et al. 2011). During the course of cerebral/reperfusion injury,
the binding of heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) with TLR2 and
TLR4 leads to the recruitment of Myeloid differentiation
factor 88 (MyD88), activation of transcription factors, and
the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (Vabulas
et al. 2001). It was reported that the combination of high
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) with TLR2 or TLR4 activated
its downstream MyD88-IRAK signal pathway to induce
the release of cytokines (Piao et al. 2009). However, the
precise mechanism of Lrg on brain ischemic injury remains
to be elucidated. Therefore, careful understanding of the cross
talk between Lrg and associated-proteins of the TLR4 signaling
pathway is very important for more effective therapies.
In conclusion, this report demonstrates that Lrg participates
in LPS preconditioning-induced tolerance to ischemic brain
injury. Knocking out the Lrg gene exacerbates brain damage
after MCAO via the TLR4 signaling pathway. Therefore, Lrg
may play an important role in ischemic brain injury and may
represent a novel therapeutic target in the prevention of ischemic
brain injury.
