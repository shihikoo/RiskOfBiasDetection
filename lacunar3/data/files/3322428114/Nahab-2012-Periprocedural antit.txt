ABSTRACT
In patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke, antithrombotic therapies
are utilized to prevent distal embolization, arterial reocclusion, or catheter-related embolism.
However, this must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhagic complications secondary to existing
and ongoing ischemia or silent vessel perforation. In this article, we present an overview of the
available literature evaluating antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing endovascular therapy
for acute ischemic stroke and discuss the emerging role of these agents. Neurology®2012;79

Intra-arterial therapy (IAT) has emerged as an important adjunct to IV thrombolysis in acute
ischemic stroke (AIS). Although IAT has many theoretical advantages, including site specificity
and high recanalization rates, early reocclusion and distal embolization occur in 18%–22% and
16%, respectively, of the AIS patient population that undergoes endovascular therapy.1–3
Periprocedural antithrombotic therapy may be used to reduce these complications, but it must
be weighed against the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Here we present an overview of the
literature evaluating the utility of antithrombotic therapies for periprocedural support and
recanalization in patients undergoing AIS endovascular therapy.
ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS FOR PERIPROCEDURAL SUPPORT Anticoagulation therapy. Since the
development of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), IV unfractionated heparin has remained the primary
antithrombotic agent for prevention of periprocedural ischemic complications as a result of its immediate anticoagulation
effect, its short half-life, its ability to be monitored with point-of-care testing, and the availability of IV
protamine sulfate to rapidly reverse its anticoagulation effect.4,5 Unfractionated heparin–mediated inactivation of
coagulation proteases (thrombin, factors IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa) occurs via its binding to and subsequent activation
of antithrombin III (figure 1).6Optimal periprocedural activated clotting time (ACT) in PCI has been empirically
determined to range from 250 to 350 seconds (normal, 81–125 seconds),7 based on the American College of
Cardiology level of evidence C (consensus opinion of experts, case studies, standard of care).8 Similarly, there are
limited data on the safety of periprocedural heparin in AIS endovascular therapy.
The Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism (PROACT) trial was the first double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled study of recombinant pro-urokinase (rpro-UK) delivered intra-arterially by microcatheter in
acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke.9 The initial 16 patients received a 100-IU (international
units)/kg IV bolus of heparin, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 4 hours. At the end of
the rpro-UK infusion, 81.8% of patients treated with this “high-dose heparin” demonstrated recanalization
(thrombolysis in myocardial ischemia score [TIMI], 23), with an associated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage
(sICH) rate of 27.3%. The heparin regimen was modified for the remaining patients on the recommendation

of the External Safety Committee and Drs. Jack Hirsh,
Gregory del Zoppo, and Anthony Furlan. The bolus
dose and infusion rates were lowered to 2,000 IU and
500 IU/hour, respectively. In patients treated with rpro-
UK, the “low-dose heparin” regimen effectively cut the
sICH and MCA recanalization rates to 6.7% and 40%,
respectively (personal communication, A. Furlan, January
2010).
Subsequently, multiple IAT trials evaluating endovascular
therapy in AIS have relied on a low-dose
heparin regimen similar to that of the PROACT
trial. The previously effective low-dose heparin protocol
was also shown to be effective in eliciting a
recanalization and sICH rate of 66% and 10%, respectively
, in PROACT II, a phase III trial designed
to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of intraarterial
(IA) rpro-UK in acute MCA ischemic stroke
of less than 6-hour duration.10 Moreover, a low-dose
IV regimen (2,000 IU bolus followed by 450 IU/
hour), in addition to a heparin flush (40 IU/hour,
administered via access sheath and guide catheter),
was used in the Interventional Management of
Stroke (IMS) I and II trials.11,12These trials, designed
to assess whether a combined IV/IAT approach to
recanalization was superior to standard IV rtPA alone
in AIS, found that recanalization rates (TIMI 2 3)
were similar (IMS I: 56%; IMS II: 60%), with rates
of sICH comparable to those in other endovascular
acute stroke studies (IMS I: 6.3%; IMS II:
9.9%).11,12 The ongoing IMS III study uses the same
heparin regimen used in IMS I and IMS II.13
Recently, the safety of low-dose heparin, when
combining mechanical devices with IV or IA thrombolytic
therapy, has been further demonstrated in
multiple prospective, multicenter single-arm mechanical
embolectomy trials. In the Mechanical Embolus
Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI) trial,
164 patients with large-vessel stroke underwent
thrombectomy with the Merci retriever device
within 8 hours of symptom onset, including 48 patients
(29.3%) who received IV rtPA before intervention.14 Periprocedural heparin was given at the

discretion of the treating interventionalist, and data
on periprocedural heparin use was collected on consecutive
patients enrolled in the final 6 months of the
study. Of the 51 patients enrolled during this study
period, 24 (47%) received periprocedural IV heparin
, with a median dose of 3,000 IU, including 8
patients who received IV rtPA. In a post hoc analysis,
there was no significant difference in rates of revascularization
success, hemorrhage, procedural complications
, or 90-day mortality between patients receiving
heparin and those not receiving heparin. In multivariable
analysis, a 90-day good outcome (modified
Rankin Scale score, 0–2) was associated with
periprocedural heparin use (odds ratio [OR] 5.89;
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–25.92; p 
0.0189).15
In the phase I study of the Penumbra System, 20
patients received treatment with mechanical embolectomy
, including 6 patients who received IV rtPA and 9
patients who received postdevice IA rtPA.16 Heparin
(2,000-IU bolus, followed by 1,000-IU/hour continuous
infusion) was administered systemically to patients
who received thrombolytic therapy. Patients who did
not receive thrombolytic therapy were administered a
higher bolus dose (5,000 IU) and infusion rate (continuous
infusion of 2,000 IU/hour) to maintain ACT of a
least 250 seconds. Recanalization (TIMI 2–3) before IA
lysis was achieved in all treated cases, and 2 patients
(10%) developed sICH.16
Table 1 summarizes the doses of periprocedural
heparin used in AIS endovascular trials.
Antiplatelet therapy. Platelet adhesion and aggregation
are central features of arterial thrombosis and
arterial reocclusion.2The inhibitory effect of conventional
antiplatelet drugs, including aspirin and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) analogues (clopidogrel or
ticlopidine), are dependent on inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis or signal transduction pathways induced
by activated ADP receptors (figure 2).
The evolution of intracranial stenting for AIS
highlights the importance of adequate platelet inhibition
for periprocedural support to prevent stent
thrombosis. In the first US Food and Drug Administration
–approved prospective study on primary intracranial
stenting for AIS,17 preprocedural oral
antiplatelet therapy included clopidogrel, 600 mg,
and aspirin, 650 mg (oral or rectal), combined with
intraprocedural heparin to achieve an ACT between
250 and 300 seconds. Recanalization (TIMI 2 or 3)
was achieved in all 20 patients, with 1 (5%) symptomatic
and 2 (10%) asymptomatic hemorrhages.
No stent thrombosis occurred in the study.
Rapid onset of the full antiplatelet effect of aspirin
and clopidogrel is essential when performing urgent
intracranial stenting to reduce the risk of stent
thrombosis. Studies on the optimal dosing of aspirin
and clopidogrel have been extrapolated from PCI
data. For patients not already on chronic aspirin
therapy, 300 to 325 mg of aspirin at least 2 hours
before PCI is recommended18; for patients not on
chronic clopidogrel therapy, loading with 600 mg
has been shown to achieve the full antiplatelet effect
within 2 hours of administration, to result in higher
plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, and
to significantly lower ADP-induced platelet aggregation
in comparison with a loading dose of 300 mg;
loading doses of 900 mg have not been shown to
result in significantly more antiplatelet effects.19–22

Data on the safety of a clopidogrel bolus in AIS is
limited to a single case series of 20 patients, in which
a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel prior to initiating
a regular dose of 75 mg/day was not associated
with hemorrhagic transformation in any of the
patients.23
It has been recognized that the response to clopidogrel
varies among patients.24,25 Clopidogrel is a
prodrug that requires oxidation by hepatic CYP450
enzymes to generate the active metabolite that inhibits
the platelet for its lifespan. The majority of clopidogrel
is inactivated by carboxylesterases, such that
only 15% of the active metabolite reaches the platelet
receptor after undergoing 2 steps of oxidative biotransformation.
As a result, loss-of-function alleles in
the gene encoding CYP450 2C19 can significantly
lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel,
and patients with these loss-of-function alleles who
undergo PCI have been shown to have increased cardiovascular
events, including stent thrombosis, in
comparison with extensive metabolizers.26–28 The
impact of clopidogrel resistance in AIS endovascular
therapy remains largely unstudied.
The use of platelet function testing has been considered
one potential approach to identify patients
with clopidogrel resistance and to individualize therapy.
This concept was evaluated in the Gauging Responsiveness
with a VerifyNow (Accumetrics, Inc.,
Corporation, San Diego, CA) assay—Impact on
Thrombosis And Safety (GRAVITAS) trial evaluating
patients undergoing elective PCI.29Patients identified
by the VerifyNow assay as nonresponders to
clopidogrel were randomly assigned to high-dose (repeat
600-mg load, followed by 150 mg daily) or
standard-dose (75 mg daily) clopidogrel 1 day after
PCI. There was no difference between the 2 treatment
arms in cardiovascular outcomes, including
death and stent thrombosis, at 30 days and 6
months. Although individualizing antiplatelet therapy
on the basis of platelet function testing is appealing
, routine platelet function testing is not currently
recommended in PCI30,31 and requires study in AIS
endovascular therapy.
Newer oral antiplatelet agents such as prasugrel,
which requires only 1 hepatic CYP450 oxidation
step to generate its active metabolite, and ticagrelor,
which is rapidly absorbed as an active metabolite
without requiring any hepatic or intestinal oxidative
biotransformation, may be more effective in patients
who have loss-of-function alleles.31However, prasugrel
is currently contraindicated in patients with a history
of stroke or TIA, after a post hoc analysis in
acute coronary syndrome patients identified a higher
rate of the combined endpoint of death from any
cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal
stroke, or nonfatal major bleeding in comparison
with clopidogrel (hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI 1.02–
2.32;p0.04),32,33and ticagrelor has not been evaluated
in stroke patients.
ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS FOR RECANALIZATION
IV antiplatelet agents. Because the final common
event in platelet aggregation requires binding of fibrinogen
to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex,
agonist pathways activating the GP IIb/IIIa complex
that are not affected by aspirin or ADP analogues are
still able to potentiate platelet aggregation.34 Although
the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors abciximab, eptifibatide
, and tirofiban have undergone large clinical
trials in PCI to establish their safety and effectiveness
, data on their role in patients with AIS undergoing
IAT is limited to only 4 case series that have
included10 patients and 2 prospective studies of
patients treated with combination thrombolysis and
abciximab.35–40
In one AIS study, a total of 26 patients were
treated with IA urokinase (UK), with or without IV
abciximab (0.25-mg/kg bolus, then 0.125-g/kg/
min periprocedural infusion).35 Patients who received
both treatments had significantly higher
recanalization rates (TIMI 2  3) than patients
treated with IA UK alone (UK abciximab 90% vs
UK 43.8%; p 0.037), with no significant difference
in sICH (UK abciximab, 16%, vs UK, 30%;

p 1.0).35 Patients who received abciximab also required
significantly lower amounts of UK to achieve
recanalization than patients treated with UK alone
(418,000 IU vs 828,000 IU; p 0.005). In another
series, 12 AIS patients refractory to IV or IA thrombolysis
, were given an IV or IA abciximab bolus
(mean, 11.8 5.8 mg) in addition to angioplasty,
mechanical embolectomy, or stenting; 11 patients
(92%) had successful recanalization (TIMI 2 3),
with 1 instance (8.3%) of sICH.36GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors
were also evaluated as adjunctive therapy for
patients with large-vessel occlusion and AIS refractory
to pharmacologic thrombolysis with rtPA and
mechanical disruption, balloon angioplasty, or both.
Twenty-one patients with large-vessel occlusion refractory
to IAT were treated with IV or IA GP IIa/
IIIb inhibitors, with recanalization (TIMI 2  3)
achieved in 17 (81%) and no cases of sICH.37 IV
tirofiban has also been evaluated in combination
with heparin and followed by IA urokinase in 21 AIS
patients38; recanalization (TIMI 23) was achieved
in 17 patients (81%), although sICH occurred in 5
patients (24%) and included 3 fatal hemorrhages. Although
these case series suggested high recanalization
rates associated with the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors
in IAT, the risk of sICH associated with their use
remained a concern.
The Combined Local Fibrinolysis and IV Abciximab
in Acute Vertebrobasilar Stroke Treatment
(FAST) multicenter study prospectively evaluated IV
abciximab (0.25 mg/kg) followed by a 12-hour
infusion (0.125 g/kg/min) and low-dose IA rtPA
(median dose, 20 mg) in patients with acute vertebrobasilar
occlusion; additional angioplasty/stenting
was allowed if there was severe residual stenosis.39 Of
47 patients, 34 (72%) achieved recanalization (TIMI
2  3), though 14 patients required angioplasty/
stenting; sICH occurred in 6 patients (13%), all of
whom died. In another prospective study, the combination
of IV abciximab (0.25-mg/kg bolus, followed
by 0.125g/kg/min) with escalating doses of IA reteplase
(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 units) was evaluated in AIS
patients 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset as part of
an open-label, dose-ranging, phase I study.40 Twenty
patients were recruited; 18 successfully received IV
abciximab with escalating doses of IA reteplase, and 2
patients had premature discontinuations due to
sICH or pseudothrombocytopenia. Recanalization
(defined as an improvement by 1 or more grades
from baseline) was achieved in 13 patients (65%),
and 1 patient had sICH (5%). The safety stopping
rule was not activated in any of the tiers.40 Together
these prospective studies demonstrated high recanalization
rates associated with the use of GP IIb/IIIa
inhibitors in IAT with a moderate risk of sICH.
Although other case series also suggest that IV abciximab
may be effective in the treatment of arterial
reocclusion after initial recanalization in AIS,2,3,41
data from the Multi-MERCI Trial, part 1, suggest
caution is warranted in the use of abciximab to complement
AIS endovascular therapy. Major protocol
violations in this study included 9 patients who were
treated with IV abciximab, and its use was associated
with asymptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR
19.2; 95% CI 3.68 to100).42 Additionally, a recent
multicenter series including 12 AIS patients undergoing
IAT with adjunctive IV or IA abciximab
resulted in sICH in 3 (25%).43 The use of GP IIb/
IIIa inhibitors in AIS patients undergoing IAT remains
investigational and of uncertain benefit.
Oral antiplatelet agents. Although pooled analyses
from 2 large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials
have shown a modest but statistically significant benefit
from aspirin in the prevention of recurrent stroke
events when initiated within 48 hours of ischemic
stroke,44aspirin administration is contraindicated for
24 hours after IV thrombolysis.45,46The optimal timing
to initiate oral antiplatelets in AIS patients who
do not receive IV thrombolysis and undergo endovascular
therapy has yet to be systematically evaluated.
The majority of endovascular trials in AIS have
prohibited the administration of antiplatelet agents
or anticoagulants for 24 hours posttreatment.9–13
The MERCI and Multi-MERCI studies allowed 325
mg of aspirin to be given orally or rectally at the end
of the embolectomy procedure, with no oral/IV
anticoagulation administered in the first 24 hours
posttreatment.
DISCUSSION Optimal doses of heparin and antiplatelet
therapies for periprocedural support during
AIS endovascular therapy have not been established.
However, these data suggest that a low-dose heparin
regimen (2,000-IU bolus followed by a 500-IU/hour
continuous infusion) may be safe in cases where IV
rtPA has been administered. In cases where mechanical
embolectomy is performed, without prior IV
rtPA administration, a higher-dose heparin regimen
(5,000-IU bolus followed by a 2,000-IU/hour continuous
infusion, to maintain ACT250 seconds)
may be considered. Periprocedural support for intracranial
stenting in AIS requires adequate platelet inhibition
to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis and
can be achieved with loading doses of aspirin, 300 to
650 mg, and clopidogrel, 600 mg. The role of platelet
function testing in AIS endovascular therapy requires
further study before its routine use can be
recommended.

to augment recanalization in AIS endovascular ther-

apy has not been established. Although preliminary
studies suggest that IV antiplatelet therapies may
augment recanalization in AIS endovascular therapy
when combined with IV or IA thrombolytic therapy,
the risk of hemorrhagic complications remains a concern
and further prospective studies are needed before
their use can be recommended. Oral antiplatelet
therapies remain contraindicated for 24 hours after
IV thrombolytic therapy; however, early initiation
may be considered after AIS endovascular therapy,
especially in patients who have undergone mechanical
embolectomy without IA thrombolysis.
Our recommended strategies for periprocedural
anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapies in AIS
endovascular therapy are summarized in table 2.
CONCLUSION Despite the availability of multiple
antithrombotic agents, many questions remain on
the optimal use of these agents for AIS endovascular
therapy, as evidenced by the lack of uniformity
among studies to date. Although periprocedural anticoagulant
and antiplatelet therapies have been demonstrated
to reduce periprocedural thrombotic
complications in PCI, further studies are warranted
in AIS to define their optimal use and dosing during
IAT when balanced against their risk of hemorrhage.
