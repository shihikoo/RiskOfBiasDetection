Growing clinical evidence implicates isoform-specific effects of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in reducing
neuroinflammation and mediating adaptive responses following ischemic and traumatic brain injury.
However, the intact apoEholoprotein does not crossthe blood–brain barrier and thus has limitedtherapeutic potential.
We have created a small peptide, COG1410 (acetyl-AS-Aib-LRKL-Aib-KRLL-amide), derived from the
apoE receptor-binding region. COG1410 retains the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective biological properties
oftheintactholoprotein and penetrates theblood–brain barrier.Inthe currentstudy, we utilizeda murinemodel
of transient focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion to demonstrate that intravenous (IV) administration of
COG1410 reduces infarct volume and radiographic progression of infarct, and improves functional outcome as
assessed by rotarod when delivered up to 4 h after ischemia onset.

Introduction
With estimated costs in excess of 34 billion dollars for stroke for
2008 alone, over 795,000 strokes occur annually in the United States,
making it the fourth leading cause of death (Roger et al., 2012). The
only FDA approved pharmacological treatment for stroke is intravenous
(IV) administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However
, reperfusion strategies are limited by their time-sensitive nature
and risk of intracranial hemorrhage; thus, neuroprotective drugs will
likely play an adjunctive role in the future management of cerebral ischemia.
Unfortunately, neuroprotective strategies that have looked
promising in the preclinical setting have largely failed to translate
successfully in human clinical trials. Thus, the identification of new
neuroprotective strategies for acute stroke remains a compelling
unmet clinical need.
Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a multifunctional 299-amino acid protein, is
the primary apolipoprotein found in the central nervous system (CNS).
Three common human apoE isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4) differ
by single cysteine to arginine interchanges (Weisgraber, 1994). Although
originally described in the context of cholesterol transport, apoE in the
CNS affords neuroprotection in a variety of injury models (Bart et al.,
1998; Laskowitz et al., 1997; Sheng et al., 1999). Several mechanisms
may explain the protective effects of apoE after brain injury. For example,
apoE exerts direct in vitro neuroprotective properties in cell culture assays
of glutamate excitotoxicity (Aono et al., 2002). Further, apoE
down-regulates glial activation and reduces secondary neuronal injury
in in vivo models of CNS inflammation (Colton et al., 2004;
Laskowitz et al., 2010; Lynch et al., 2002, 2003). Due to its size, however
, the intact apoE holoprotein does not cross the blood–brain barrier
(BBB). To address this issue, we created a series of small apoE-
mimetic peptides derived from its receptor-binding region. These
peptides retain the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects
of the native protein yet cross the BBB (Laskowitz et al., 2001,
2007; Laskowitz and Vitek, 2007). Although an original peptide derived
from the receptor binding region (apoE133–149) improved
outcomes in models of closed head injury and perinatal hypoxia/
ischemia (Lynch et al., 2005; McAdoo et al., 2005), the translational
potential was limited by relatively poor CNS penetration and low potency.
More recently, a more potent apoE anologue, COG1410, was
derived from residues 138–149 of the holoprotein by incorporating

two aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) substitutions to enhance helical structure.
In prior studies, COG1410 decreased microglial activation in cell
culture (Gao et al., 2006; Laskowitz et al., 2006)andextendedthetherapeutic
window following traumatic brain injury relative to apoE(133–
149) (Laskowitz et al., 2007). Here, we tested the hypothesis that
COG1410 administration improves histological, radiographic, and functional
outcomes in a murine model of focal ischemia/reperfusion.
Materials and methods
All animal procedures were approved by the Duke University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ten to 12 week old
C57Bl/6J malemice(Jackson Laboratories,BarHarbor, Maine) were randomized
into experimental groups. All procedures and assessments
were performed in blinded fashion.
Peptide synthesis and administration
Peptides were synthesized by NeoMPS (San Diego, CA, USA) to a
purity of 95%. COG1410: acetyl-AS-Aib-LRKL-Aib-KRLL-amide is derived
from apoE residues 138–149 with Aib substitutions at positions
140 and 145. COG1410 was dissolved in sterile saline immediately
before use. Based on efficacy in previous studies, a dose of COG1410
0.6 mg/kg in 100 μL volume was administered via tail vein injection
(Laskowitz et al., 2007).
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
We used our modified, previously described MCAO procedure
(Laskowitz et al., 1997). Mice were induced with 4.6% isoflurane,
endotracheally intubated, and mechanically ventilated with 1.6%
isoflurane in 30% O
2
/70% N
2
. The right common carotid artery was
identified, and the external carotid artery ligated and transected. A
blunt-tip 6–0nylonmono filament was inserted into the proximal
external carotid artery stump and advanced 11 mm into the internal
carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 90 min the
filament was removed to restore brain perfusion, and the skin incision
closed with suture. Isoflurane was discontinued, and mice
were extubated upon recovery of spontaneous respiration. Rectal
temperature was servo-regulated with surface heating/cooling at
37 °C throughout the surgical procedure.
Measurement of physiological parameters
A parallel study was performed to investigate the physiological effects
of treatment. Surrogate mice of controlled age, sex, and weight
underwent the identical anesthetic and MCAO procedures described
above. A right femoral artery catheter was placed for monitoring of hemodynamics
and a 1.9 mm diameter laser Doppler probe was placed
on the skull in the middle cerebral artery distribution area (1 mm posterior
and 5 mm lateral to bregma) (Tsuchiya et al., 2003) for cortical
perfusion recording beginning 5 min before ischemia and continuing
through 60 min after reperfusion. Right jugular vein catheter
was placed to administer slow (100 μL/min) IV infusion of peptide
or vehicle at 30 min after reperfusion.
Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) quantification of
COG1410 in brain
COG1410 (0.6 mg/kg) was administered via tail vein injection 30 min
post-reperfusion. At 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min after injection, animals
(n=3/time point) were transcardially perfused with saline. Each hemisphere
was flashfrozenat−20 °C for further analysis. Homogenized
brain tissue was centrifuged (20,000 ×g for30minat4°C)and100μL
of supernatant removed for analysis. All extraction buffers contained
10 μg/mL of 13C/15N-labelled peptide of the same sequence as an internal
standard. Peptide quantification was completed by LC/MS using an
Agilent Poroshell C18, 2.1×100 mm column with a 90% solvent A/10%
solvent B to 65% solvent B gradient in 7 min, where solvent A is 95%
water/5% acetonitrile/0.025% TFA and solvent B is 5% water/95%
acetonitrile/0.025% TFA. Concentrations were determined by comparing
signals to standard samples of the free peptide in brain tissue
ranging from 0.05 to 25 μg/mL, and processing as previously
described (Lynch et al., 2005).
Motor deficit testing
Rotarod (UgoBasile, Comerio, Italy) with an accelerating rotational
mode was used to assess vestibulomotor function (Hamm et al.,
1994). After a single training trial, mice underwent daily tests of 3 trials
on the day (0) prior to MCAO and in the three days (1–3) following
injury. Average latency to fall was recorded. Mice unable to grasp
the rotating rod were assigned a latency of 0 s.
Histology
Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated 72 h
after MCAO. Brains were removed and frozen at −20 °C. Using a
cryotome, 20 μm thick coronal sections were cut at 440 μm intervals
over the rostral-caudal extent of the infarct. Sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Infarct volume was measured by digitally
sampling stained sections with a Sony CCD Model XC-77 camera
controlled by a M2 Turnkey System image analyzer (Imaging Research
, St. Catharines, Canada). With the observer blinded to experimental
condition, in order to correct the infarct size for edema, the
following regions of interest (ROI) were cursor outlined: noninfarcted
ipsilateral cerebral cortex and subcortex, contralateral cerebral cortex
and subcortex. The area within each ROI (mm2) was determined by
automated counting of calibrated pixels. Assuming the two hemispheres’ volume are equal before edema caused by stroke, ipsilateral
(right) noninfarcted total areas were subtracted from the corresponding
contralateral (left) ROI values to estimate the area of ischemic
tissue damage. Infarct volumes (cubic millimeters) were
computed as running sums of subtracted infarct area multiplied by
the known interval (e.g., 440 μm) between sections over the rostralcaudal
extent of the infarct calculated as an orthogonal projection.
Assessment of cerebral edema
Mice subjected to 90 min of MCAO received a single IV injection of
COG1410 or vehicle 2 h from ischemia onset (30 min following reperfusion
), then were euthanized at 24 h after MCAO. Brains were sectioned
midsagittally with removal of cerebellum and brain stem, and
each hemisphere was weighed immediately (“wet” weight). Hemispheres
were allowed to dehydrate over 24 h at 105 °C and then
reweighed (“dry” weight). Cerebral edema was expressed as water
content calculated as a percentage of wet weight (wet weight−
dry weight)/(wet weight)×100% (James et al., 2009).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol
MRI was performed on a Bruker 7T (70/30) system (BrukerBiospin,
Billerica, MA, USA) utilizing quadrature surface receive and volume transmit
coil set-up. Animals were anesthetized (induction: 5% isoflurane,
maintenance: 1.5% isoflurane) and body temperature was maintained
at 37 °C, with continuous monitoring of respiratory rate.
T2-weighted anatomic images were acquired using RARE (TR=
4200, TE=12, RARE factor 8, 1 mm, FOV 2.4 cm, 256×256). Diffusionweighted
images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were
then generated using double spin-echo planar pulse sequence using
three orthogonal directions. Four b values (b=0, 100, 200, 1000) were
acquired with a matrix size of 128×128×15, slice thickness 1.0 mm.

Volume sets for diffusion-weighted images were created from raw
DICOM images. Stroke volumes were calculated in semi-automated,
blinded fashion from ADC maps generated off the DWI acquisitions.
We used the common ADC threshold for infarction of 0.55 and
× 10 −3 mm2/s. Stroke volumes were calculated by importing ADC
maps into Osirix (Pixmeo, Geneva, SW), setting the ADC threshold for
infarction in the software's automated brush ROIs function, andfinally
calculating the stroke volume using the software's automated volume
calculator.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) RNA quantification
Total mouse brain RNA was isolated from the injured hemisphere
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's specifications. Cytokine gene expression was determined
by relative quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Gene Specific Relative RT-PCR kits
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Briefly, this method utilizes a multiplex RT-PCR approach in which
two primer sets are used in a single reaction—one set to amplify the
cDNA of interest (i.e. TNF α) and a second to amplify and invariant
endogenous control (18S rRNA). A set of 18S PCR competitors is
also included to prevent loss of relative quantitation. By mixing 18S
primers with increasing amounts of 18S competimers, the overall
PCR amplification efficiency of 18S cDNA can be reduced without
the primers becoming limiting and without loss of relative quantitation
of TNFα. To ensure meaningful results, preliminary RT-PCR experiments
were first performed to determine the linear range of
amplification for the samples. The conditions were: 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C
annealing 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s for 22 cycles. The sequence of the TNFα
primers supplied by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) is proprietary.
The resulting PCR products were run on 6% acrylamide gels
and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantitated
using Image Quant 5.0 software. For each sample, the signal
obtained for the gene-specific amplicon was divided by the signal
obtained for the 18S amplicon yielding a corrected relative value for
the gene-specific product in each sample.
Statistical analysis
Rotarod performance, infarct volume, pharmacokinetics, and hemodynamic
data were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with time as the repeated variable. Interhemispheric
water weight difference, quantitative RT-PCR fold changes were compared
using Student t-test. MRI data were evaluated using student's
t-test and correction for multiple comparisons was performed by
Bonferroni's method. Statistical significance was assumed when pb0.05
and values are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean.
Results
Physiological effects of COG1410
To establish whether any potential vasoactive effects of the peptide
have hypotensive effects, a cohort of mice underwent 90 min MCAO
with a single IV administration of peptide or vehicle (n=3/group)
30 min after reperfusion to monitor blood pressure and cerebral blood
flow. IV administration of COG1410 did not have any adverse hemodynamic
effects (Fig. 1A) and starts improving post-ischemic cerebral
bloodflow 25 min after treatment (Fig. 1B).
Fig. 1.(A) Mean arterial blood pressure was assessed at 5-min intervals by femoral arterial catheterization in animals (n=3/group). Ischemia was induced for 90 min followed by
reperfusion. Animals were treated with intravenous administration of either COG1410 or vehicle 120 min following ischemia (30 min following reperfusion). Treatment has no
effect on blood pressure. (B) There is a dramatic reduction in hemispheric blood flow ipsilateral to the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as measured by laser Doppler.
Following reperfusion, there is a persistent reduction in blood flow to approximately 80% of baseline values. Administration of COG1410 results in a statistically significant
increase in hemispheric cerebral blood flow start from 25 min after treatment (*pb0.05 by repeated measure ANOVA).

COG1410 penetrates the BBB after MCAO
In a separate cohort of mice, LC/MS was used to directly assess
COG1410 concentrations after IV injection in both cerebral hemispheres
following MCAO. We found significant penetration of COG1410 into both
hemispheres for up to 60 min after reperfusion. There was significant
increase in COG1410 at 60 min after reperfusion in the ipsilateral hemisphere
relative to the uninjured (contralateral) hemisphere (1.24±
0.289 vs. 0.22±0.064, p=0.026) (Fig. 2).
COG1410 improves functional and histological outcomes after MCAO
Mice subjected to 90 min of MCAO received a single IV injection of
COG1410 or vehicle 2 h from ischemia onset (30 min following reperfusion
). Treatment with COG1410 resulted in a consistent improvement
in rotarod performance relative to vehicle treatment
over 3 days following cerebral ischemia (n=10/group, F(1,34)=
4.47,p=0.0496,Fig. 3A). In follow up studies to define the therapeutic
window, a single dose of COG1410 was also associated with durable
functional improvement when administered 3 h after ischemia
onset (n=9/group, F(1,32)=4.846, p=0.043; Fig. 3B) but not when
administered 4 h after ischemia onset (n=10/group,p=0.95;Fig. 3C).
To test the hypothesis that a multiple dosing paradigm would extend
the therapeutic window, a separate cohort of mice was used to
compare repeated dosing of vehicle versus COG1410 (initial IVinjection
of COG1410 at 4 h followed by four subsequent injections of COG1410
at 6-h intervals). Analyses revealed that repeated dosing of COG1410
beginning at 4 h post MCAO accelerated recovery of function relative
to repeat dosing of vehicle (Treatment×Day interaction: F(2,54)=
3.5,p=0.04). Testing of simple main effects of Treatment reveal no differences
on Day 1 (p=0.1). However, repeated dosing of COG1410
yielded significantly better rotarod performance on Day 2 (F(1,27)=
6.61,p=0.02)andDay3(F(1,27)=7.07,p=0.01;Fig. 3D) than did repeated
dosing of vehicle.
Fig. 2. Administration of COG1410 resulted in significant CNS penetration in both the
ischemic and non-injured hemisphere, which peaks at 10–30 min post-intravenous injection.
At 60 min, there is a significantly higher concentration of drug in the ischemic
hemisphere, which may reflect transient disruption of the blood brain barrier (*pb0.05
by paired t-test).
Fig. 3.A single intravenous administration of COG1410 improves vestibulomotor function when administered at 120 min (A), 180 min (B), but not 240 min (C) after induction of
ischemia compared to vehicle. However, when the injection at 240 min post-ischemia is followed by 4 additional injections at 6 h intervals, improvement in functional outcome is
observed (D). (*pb0.05; **pb0.01 by repeated measure ANOVA).

Baseline rotarod performance (Day 0) prior to MCAO did not differ
between the treatment groups (all p>0.19). Recovery of function
(improvement across days) was evident in all analyses (main effect
of Day: all pb0.009). The rate of recovery did not differ as a function
of treatment group when single doses of COG1410 were administered
at 120, 180 or 240 min (Treatment×Day interaction: all p>0.09).
Functional improvements were associated with histological reduction
of infarct volumes when assessed volumetrically at 72 h post-ischemia
(Fig. 4). Total infarct volume was reduced when COG1410 was administered
as a single IV dose at 120 min (t(11)=2.29, p=0.042) and
180 min (t(16)=2.15, p=0.047), but not 240 min (t(17)=0.44, p=
0.67), compared to vehicle. However, repeated dosing of COG1410 beginning4
h postMCAO wasfoundtosignificantly reduce infarctvolume
relative to repeated vehicle at 240 min post MACAO (t(28)=4.74,
pb0.001).
COG1410 reduces brain edema after ischemic stroke
To coincide with the beginning of maximal inflammatory effect after
stroke (Zhang et al., 2006), and to correct infarct size for edema, another
cohort mice receiving COG1410 or vehicle at 120 min (30 min after reperfusion
) were used to assess brain edema. In the uninjured hemisphere
(left) water content does not differ markedly between the two
groups, but vehicle treated animals do have a significant increase of
water content in the injured (right) hemisphere at 24 h as compared
to the COG1410 treated animals (83.8±0.42 vs. 79.04±0.15%; t(10)=
10.838, pb0.01) (Fig. 5).
COG1410 reduces infarct evolution after MCAO
In mice receiving either COG1410 (n=6) or vehicle (n=10) injection
at 2 h after ischemia onset, MRI was performed at 4 h postischemia
onset and repeated at 24 h post-ischemia onset. MRI and
volumetric measurements demonstrated that administration of
COG1410 did not reduce infarct volume at 4 h (p=0.87) but did at
24 h (t(14)=3.87, p=0.007) indicating a significant slowing in
the evolution of infarction between 4 and 24 h post-injury compared
with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 6).
COG1410 is associated with reduction of neuroinflammation following
MCAO
To investigate the possibility that reduced infarct evolution demonstrated
by serial MRI images were secondary to an effect of COG1410 on
early inflammatory responses, TNF-αRNA was quantified using relative
quantitative RT-PCR (see Materials and Methods). The analysis was
performed using RNA isolated from the injured (right) brain hemisphere
at 1 and 3 h following ischemia onset in mice receiving
COG1410 or vehicle at 2 h after ischemia onset (n=5/group). At
Fig. 4.Mice were sacrificed at 72 h post-ischemia. Hematoxylin/Eosin staining reveals larger infarct volume in vehicle-treated animals (A) compared to those receiving a single dose
of COG1410 (B), both representive slices are at 1 mm anterior to Bregma. Consistent with the functional data, volumetric analysis of infarct reveals asmaller infarct volumes when
the peptide is administered at 2 h and 3 h but not 4 h following ischemia (C). When the 4 h injection was followed by 4 additional injections of COG1410, there was a reduction in
total infarct volumes compared to vehicle treatment (*pb0.05; **pb0.01) (D).

1 h following ischemia onset (prior to drug administration), TNF-α
RNA levels were 13.39±1.76%, normalized to internal control. At
3 h after ischemia onset, TNF-α RNA was significantly reduced in
COG1410-treated (2.56+0.38) compared to vehicle-treated mice
(5.33+0.84; pb0.05, Fig. 6), resulting in a significant reduction in
inflammatory response (t(8)=3.00, p=0.02) (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of the
ischemic cascade, neuroprotection trials have failed to demonstrate
clinical efficacy. Thus, pharmacological treatment after acute stroke
remains a significant unmet clinical need. Ideally, a neuroprotective
drug would complement reperfusion strategies by targeting secondary
injury mechanisms, such as inflammation or oxidative stress. In
the current study, we demonstrated that a peptide derived from the
receptor-binding region of apoE was well-tolerated and improved
histological, radiographic, and functional outcomes when administered
up to 4 h following the onset of cerebral ischemia. Moreover,
administration of the apoE based therapeutic reduced infarct evolution
over the first 24 h.
ApoE is the primary apolipoprotein found in the CNS, where it is produced
primarily by astrocytes and is upregulated after injury (Laskowitz
et al., 1998). ApoE appears to play an adaptive role following acute cerebral
ischemia, as apoE-deficient animals demonstrate worse functional
outcomes and increased tissue injury following focal (Laskowitz et al.,
1997) and global (Horsburgh et al., 2000; Sheng et al., 1999) ischemia,
independent of vascular changes (Bart et al., 1998). Further, intraventricular
administration of apoE improves outcome in murine models
of ischemia (Horsburgh et al., 2000). However, the endogenous apoE
holoprotein does not readily cross the BBB. In fact, apoE found within
the CNS represents a distinct pool from that found in the periphery
(Linton et al., 1991). Given the impracticality of intrathecal delivery, it
is unlikely that intact apoE could serve as a viable therapeutic strategy
in acute neurological disease.
We previously demonstrated that small peptides may be created
from the apoE receptor-binding region (ApoE133–149) that mimic the
neuroprotective (Aono et al., 2003)andanti-in flammatory (Laskowitz
et al., 2001; Laskowitz and Vitek, 2007; Lynch et al., 2003)propertiesof
the intact holoprotein. However one limitation of apoE(133–149) was
the relatively large size, low CNS penetration, and low potency. The desirability
of smaller and more potent apoE-derived therapeutic peptides
led to our development of acetyl-AS-Aib-LRKL-Aib-KRLL-amide, a truncated
peptide that contains two Aib substitutions at positions L140 and
R145 of apoE(133–149) (Laskowitz et al., 2006). Aib is a non-naturally
occurring amino acid that has been shown to enhance helical conformation
(Marshall et al., 1990) and binding affinity because it exhibits reduced
conformational entropy loss upon binding, relative to other
amino acids (Ratnaparkhi et al., 2000). This peptide was significantly
more potent than apoE (133–149) in our cell-based assay of microglial
suppression (Gao et al., 2006; Laskowitz et al., 2006, 2007). As compared
to apoE(133–149), COG1410 also increased the therapeutic window for
treatment after injury (Laskowitz et al., 2007). In a prior study, administration
of COG1410 increased luminal diameter following experimental
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (Gao et al., 2006), raising the possibility
that its vasoactive effects may induce hypotension; however this was
not observed in the current study.
Neuroinflammation represents a promising therapeutic target after
ischemia. Microglial activation results in oxidative stress and the release
of inflammatory mediators, contributes to BBB breakdown, secondary
neuronal injury, and development of cerebral edema (Lakhan et al.,
2009). A strategy targeting neuroinflammation and secondary infarct
evolution would likely be associated with a relatively prolonged therapeutic
window and thus have improved potential for clinical translation.
Mechanisms by which apoE improves recovery after cerebral ischemia
are likely multifunctional, and include reduction in neuronal
excitotoxicity (Aono et al., 2002; Hoe et al., 2006; Sheng et al., 2008),

Fig. 6.Magnetic resonance volumetric imaging of MCAO induced focal ischemia. (A) Representative axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained at 4 h following
stroke onset and 2 h after one dose of either COG1410 or vehicle injection, and repeated at 24 h post-stroke. Evolution of focal ischemic infarct was observed over the 22 h
interval. (B) Infarct volume was significantly reduced by COG1410 at both 4 h and 24 h (*pb0.05, **pb0.01) measurement.
Fig. 7.There was dramatic upregulation of TNF-αexpression 60 min after induction of
ischemia. Following 30 min of reperfusion, vehicle or COG1410 was administered at
2 h post-ischemia. Significant reduction in TNFα RNA levels is observed 180 min
after administration of COG1410 compared to vehicle (*pb0.05).

observations suggest that the effects of apoE peptides on the NMDA receptor
are mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor related
protein receptor (LRP) (Hoe et al., 2005; Sheng et al., 2008). Interaction
of apoE with LRP has also been implicated in down-regulation of microglia
activation via modulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Pocivavsek
et al., 2009).TheapoEreceptorbindingregioniscommontoallthree
human polymorphisms; however, recent data suggests that apoE3, but
not apoE4 bind with high affinity to LRP1, and this may account for
isoform-specific effects ( Bell et al., 2012). An alternative mechanism
has been suggested by recent observations demonstrating that apoE
binds an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2a, leading to downregulation
of secondary inflammatory mediators (Christensen et al., 2011). Thus,
while our data demonstrates that COG1410 reduces inflammatory responses
in the ischemic brain, the exact mechanism(s) by which this occurs
is only partially understood. Of note, COG 1410 does not contain the
polymorphic regions of human apoE, and thus is not a good model to
study isoform-specificeffects.
Although COG1410 appears to be a promising candidate for poststroke
neuroprotection, a number of promising therapies have failed
to translate from the lab to the clinical setting. This has led to formal
recommendations by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) for identifying preclinical neuroprotectant drugs with
the highest probability of success in clinical trials (Anon., 1999). In
the current study, we were able to address several of the STAIR
criteria, including defining the therapeutic window, including physiological
monitoring, and both histological and functional outcome
measures. Prior studies also suggest demonstration of benefitacrossa
variety of injury paradigms and species. For example, administration
of apoE mimetic peptides has demonstrated short- and intermediateterm
functional improvement in a variety of cerebrovascular disease
models listed in Table 1, including: hypoxia-ischemia (McAdoo et al.,
2005), focal ischemia/reperfusion (Tukhovskaya et al., 2009), intracranial
hemorrhage (James et al., 2009; Laskowitz et al., 2012), subarachnoid
hemorrhage (Gao et al., 2006; Mesis et al., 2006), and related
traumatic brain injuries in which secondary injury is mediated by glial
activation (Hoane et al., 2007, 2009; Laskowitz et al., 2007; Lynch
et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).
One of the limitations in the current study is that we focused on the
mechanistic effects of COG1410 in modifying infarct evolution, and did
not assess long term functional outcomes. However, a prior study of
COG1410 did demonstrate durable functional improvements when
assessed at 35 days following ischemia/reperfusion (Tukhovskaya et al.,
2009). The fact that a peptide with a short serum half life is associated
with durable benefit suggests that modifying early post-injury inflammation
may change the long term trajectory of neuroinflammation and
secondary neuronal injury. Other limitations in the translation of COG
1410 to clinical practice is that to date, apoE-mimetic peptides have not
been tested in a permanent stroke model, global ischemia models, or in
gyrencephalic or large animal species. In the current study, single administration
of COG1410 reduced infarct volume when administered at 2
and 3 h after ischemia onset, and repeat dosing was needed to extend
the therapeutic window to 4 h post ischemia. Follow up studies are necessary
to investigate how far the therapeutic window can be extended.
Thus, although our results are promising, they should be interpreted
with caution.
Other limitations of the current study are worth discussing. To reduce
variability, all experiments were performed on young male
mice; thus, we have not defined possible interactions between effects
of apoE-based therapies on gender, age, or vascular comorbidities. Potential
limitations associated with peptide-based therapies include
short half-life. However, COG1410 CNS concentration remained appreciable
in the ischemic hemisphere for 60 min after a single IV injection
, and the functional effects on vestibulomotor function were
durable for the 3 day testing paradigm.
Insummary, we observed thatIV administration of anapoE-mimetic
peptide derived from the receptor-binding region of the holoprotein reduced
early inflammatory events, reduced infarct evolution and ultimate
infarct volume, and improved functional outcomes in a murine
model of focal stroke. Thus, the use of apoE-based therapies may have
potential for clinical translation in the setting of cerebral ischemia.
