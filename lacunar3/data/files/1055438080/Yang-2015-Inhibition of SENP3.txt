Background: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the life-threatening diseases with
high morbidity and mortality rates. SUMO-specific proteases 3 (SENP3), a member of the
small ubiquitin-like modifier specific protease family, was identified as an isopeptidase
that deconjugates SUMOylation (The covalent modification by SUMO) of modified protein
substrates. It is reported that SUMO-2/3 conjugation, a member of SUMOylation, presented
neuroprotection. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of SENP3 and to explore its
potential role in SAH.
Materials and methods: A total of 108 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 2
parts experiment and 9 subgroups (part 1:Sham group, SAH group, SAHþNAC group,
SAHþvehicle group; part 2: Sham group, SAH group, SAHþlv-SENP3 group, SAHþlv-null
group, SAHþNS group). 7 days before SAH, lentivirus was administrated into rats' left
lateral ventricle to down-regulate SENP3. Experimental SAH was imitated by injection with
0.3 ml nonheparinized autoblood into the prechiasmatic cistern. MDA levels, SOD activities
, and GSH contents were detected to evaluate oxidative stress level. SENP3 and cleaved
caspase 3 were detected by western blot, apoptosis was observed by TUNEL staining.
Results: High oxidative stress level following SAH induced rising of SENP3. And inhibition
of SENP3 by lentivirus induces suppression of apoptosis in experimental subarachnoid
hemorrhage in rats.
Conclusion: When SENP3 accumulated by high oxidative stress, caspase 3 activated
subsequently. And it leads to more severe apoptosis than physiological.

1. Introduction
Because of high morbidity and disability rates, subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH), especially aneurysm subarachnoid
hemorrhage (aSAH) is a fatal disease (Cahill et al., 2006).
Current series of studies and great numbers of reviews
illustrate that early brain injury (EBI) is an important factor
influencing outcome (Sehba et al., 2011). The EBI was considered
commonly to be the injury occurred in 72 h after SAH.
Conjugation of SUMO to specificsubstrateswhicharecertain
cellular proteins mediates numerous cell signaling pathways
including protein stabilization, apoptosis, intracellular transport
and regulation of transcription (Tan et al., 2010). The covalent
modification by SUMO, an isopeptide bond, is invertible and
regulated by a family of sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs)
(Yeh et al., 2000). SENP3 (SMT3IP1), a member in this family, has
been proved to function as a SUMO-specificprotease(Hay 2005). It
is demonstrated that SENP3, as an isopeptidase, cleaves the
isopeptide bond between lysine side chain of a substrate and
the glycine residue of SUMO (Yeh et al., 2000). Normal level of
SENP3 which deconjugates modified proteins is considerable for
keeping balance between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation. The
balance is essential for guarantying normal physiology (Bawa-
Khalfe and Yeh, 2010). This balance influences differentiation,
growth, targeting and communication between cells which are
highly complex and tightly regulated (Wilkinson et al., 2010). For
example, disrupting it contributed to cancer development and
progression (Han et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013). And it is also
important in the central nervous system (CNS). General increase
of SUMO-2/3 conjugation is a neuroprotective response to severe
stress (Guo et al., 2013). Extra SENP3 could reverse this neuroprotectioninanischemiamodel
(Yeh, 2009). SNEP3 is prevented from
proteasomal degradation related ubiquitin when accumulated
ROS stimulate cells (Yan et al., 2010).
Few studies detected SENP3 in the CNS demonstrated that it is
associated with apoptosis, which is one of the most important
mechanisms of EBI after SAH (Cahill et al., 2006). In an ischemia
model in vitro, decreased SENP3 induced a suppression of neuronal
apoptosis mediated by caspase 3 (Guo et al., 2013). In spinal cord
injury (SCI) model, SENP3 was up-regulation that Implicating for
neuronal apoptosis (Wei et al., 2012). In our pervious study, we
found that SAH caused an obvious up-regulation of SENP3 protein
expression in rat brain, especially in neurons. There was a positive
relationship between SENP3 and cleavage caspase-3. Although the
mechanism that surviving of SNEP3 is mediated by calculation of
ROS is clarify in cells. But, this is not clear in the experimental SAH
model. Therefore, one of the purposes of this study is to identify the
relationship between oxidative stress and SENP3 moreover, to deal
with our pervious question that the relationship between SENP3
and apoptosis in cerebral cortex in early brain injury following SAH,
we designed another part of experiment in this study.
2. Results
2.1. Experimental design
As shown in Fig. 1, this study consists of two parts. A total of
108 rats were randomly divided into 9 subgroups (4 in Part 1
and 5 in Part 2). The first part: Sham group, SAH group,
SAHþNAC group, SAHþvehicle group. The second part contained
5 subgroups: Sham group, SAH group, SAHþlv-SENP3
group, SAHþlv-null group, and SAHþNS group. All animals
were sacrificed at 24 h after SAH surgery. Western blot,
Immunohistochemical staining, TUNEL staining, fluorescence
observation and biochemical estimation were performed
for further analysis.
2.2. Oxidative stress changes after SAH and NAC recovery
To understand the changes of oxidative stress level after SAH
and NAC recovery, we evaluated the changes of MDA levels,
SOD activities, and GSH contents in the cerebral cortex in
each subgroup. As shown in Fig. 2A, SAH significantly
increased the levels of MDA. When recovered with NAC,
MDA levels significantly decreased, while, vehicle group was
not changed compared with SAH group. As shown in Fig. 2B
and C, SAH markedly decreased GSH contents and the

SAHþNAC group, NAC was dissolved in 0.9% saline at
concentrations of 3%. And it (150 mg/kg) was injected
intraperitoneally at 5 min and 6 h after SAH induction. In the
SAHþvehicle group, the rats had SAH induced and were
administrated with the same volume of 0.9% saline at the
corresponding time point. The second part contained 5
subgroups: Sham group, SAH group, SAHþlv-SENP3 group,
SAHþlv-null group, and SAHþNS group. In the group
SAHþlv-SENP3 and SAHþlv-null. The lentivirus was
implanted 7 days before SAH operation as mentioned above.
In the SAHþNS group, 10 μl 0.9% saline was injected into the
left lateral ventricle. All animals were killed at 24 h after SAH
surgery. Post-assessments included western blot,
immunohistochemical staining, TUNEL staining,
fluorescence observation and biochemical estimation.

suppressed the production of MDA after SAH. However, vehicle did not show the effect as same as NAC. The GSH content and
SOD activity were higher in the sham group than in the SAH and SAHþvehicle groups. In contrast, administration with NAC

activities of SOD compared with the sham groups. When
recovered with NAC, GSH contents and SOD activities levels
increased obviously compared with SAH group. However,
these two levels of vehicle group were not changed compared
with SAH group. These results indicate that NAC can
decrease oxidative stress level as reported.
2.3. The level of SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 after SAH
and NAC recovery
The levels of SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 were detected by
western blot. As shown in Fig. 3B, SENP3 in SAH group was
increased significantly compared with the sham group.
SENP3 in SAHþVehicle (normal saline) group did not change
compared with SAH group. And, SENP3 in this group was
increased statistically significantly compared with sham
group. However, SENP3 in SAHþNAC group was declined
compared with SAH group, and there was statistical difference
between the SAHþNAC group and the sham group.
Meanwhile, cleaved caspase 3 shared parallel changes with
SENP3. As shown in Fig. 3C, the level of cleaved caspase 3 in
the SAH group was increased statistically compared with the
sham group. Cleaved caspase 3 in SAHþVehicle (normal
saline) group showed no change in contrast to SAH group.
In addition, cleaved caspase 3 in this group was increased
significantly compared with sham group. And cleaved caspase
3 in SAHþNAC group declined compared with SAH
group, and there was statistical change between cleaved
caspase 3 in SAHþNAC group and sham group.
Though the result SENP3 in SAH group increased than
sham group, we verified SENP3 increased after SAH. Moreover
, SENP3 in SAHþNAC group declined compared with SAH
group, the statistical difference between SENP3 in SAHþNAC
group and sham group showed that NAC may induced SENP3
decreased, but could not recover it to the normal state. The
results of SAHþVehicle group illustrated that normal saline
as vehicle of NAC had not any function. Cleaved caspase 3
shared parallel changes with SENP3. When SENP3 is up, it
ups; when SENP3 is down, it downs. Thus, the correlation
between SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 is definite. But, clarification of the correlation between SENP3 and cleaved
caspase 3 needs further proof.
2.4. Neural apoptosis after SAH and NAC recovery
Neural apoptosis were tested by TUNEL. As shown in Fig. 4A–
D, the TUNEL staining showed that the rats in the sham
groups displayed rare apoptotic neural cells in the cortex,
whereas obvious TUNEL-positive neural cells could be
observed in the SAH and SAHþVehicle groups. TUNEL-
positive neural cells in SAHþNAC group significantly
decreased compared with SAH group. As shown in Fig. 4E,
statistical result showed that apoptotic neural cells in sham
group were rare compared with SAH group and SAHþVehicle.
And, there was no difference between SAH group and
SAHþVehicle group. TUNEL-positive neural cells in SAHþNAC
group significantly decreased compared with SAH group and
SAHþVehicle group.
2.5. The effect of lateral ventricular administration of lv-
SENP3 to SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3
The level of SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 was detected by
western blot. As shown in Fig. 5B, statistical result showed
that SENP3 in SAH group increased significantly compared
with it in sham group. This result is consistent with the
counterpart inSection 3.3. Moreover, SENP3 in SAHþlv-SENP3
group declined statistically compared to SAH group. SENP3 in
SAHþlv-null and SAHþNS group showed no difference with
SAH group. Another part which results in Fig. 5C showed that
cleaved caspase 3 kept the same traits with SENP3. Cleaved
caspase 3 in SAH augment compared to sham group. And
cleaved caspase 3 in SAHþlv-SENP3 group was lower statistically
than the counterpart in SAH group. Furthermore,
cleaved caspase 3 in SAHþlv-null and SAHþNS group did
not change compared with SAH group.
Though the results of SENP3, the deduction that lv-SENP3
could decrease SENP3 after SAH is reasonable. In addition the
result illustrated that lv-null and normal saline had not this
impact, which excludes the effect of lentivirus and solvent
(normal saline). The results of cleaved caspase 3 showed that
when lv-SENP3 induced decreasing of SENP3, cleaved caspse
3 fell. It is the same as SENP3 that lv-null and normal saline
did not take any effect.
2.6. Neuronal apoptosis of lateral ventricular
administration of lv-SENP3
Neural apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. As shown
in Fig. 6A–E, the TUNEL staining photos showed that there
were few apoptotic neural cells in the sham and SAHþlv-
SENP3 groups; however, abundant TUNEL-positive neural
cells could be observed in the SAH, SAHþlv-null and SAHþNS
groups. Statistical result in Fig. 4F illustrated that the number
of apoptotic neural cells in SAH group was larger than that in
sham group. And, apoptotic neural cells in SAHþlv-SENP3
group were rare compare with SAH, SAHþlv-null and
SAHþNS groups. In addition, TUNEL-positive neural cells in
SAHþlv-null group and SAHþNS group showed no change
compared with SAH group.
3. Discussion
3.1. SAH and NAC recovery experiment
In this study, we reported that oxidative stress level
increased by evaluating MDA levels, SOD activities, and GSH
contents in cerebral cortex after SAH. When added NAC, a
sulfhydryl-containing antioxidant, oxidative stress level
declined, however normal saline had not this function. These
showed that SAH induced the increasing of oxidative stress
level. And SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 shared similar
changing characteristics. They both significantly increased
after SAH. When NAC recovery performed, they both
decreased compared with SAH. Normal saline in this part
also has not any function. All these have reasonable explanation
that SNEP3 is prevented from proteasomal degradation
related ubiquitin when accumulated ROS stimulate cells (Yan
brain  research  1622  (2015)  270– 278 273
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
et al., 2010). Therefore, it is indicated that high oxidative
stress level following SAH induced accumulation of SENP3.
Cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis index shared the same
changing characteristics with SENP3 in all subgroup in
experiment part 1. When SENP3 increased, Cleaved caspase
3 and apoptosis index increased. When SENP3 decreased,
they decreased. The connection with cleaved caspase 3 and
apoptosis is apparent. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude
that there is certainly a relationship between SENP3 and
Cleaved caspase 3. However, the explicit connection in SAH
needs further experiment. Hence, we designed experiment
part 2.
3.2. Lv-SENP3 implantation experiment
Numbers of studies have indicated that apoptosis is involved
in the pathogenesis of EBI after SAH (Cahill et al., 2006).
Following SAH, apoptosis had been detected in the cortex,
hippocampus, vasculature and blood brain barrier (Zubkov
et al., 2001; Park et al., 2004;Ostrowski et al., 2005; Zhou et al.,
2005; Yuksel et al., 2012). Several kinds of apoptotic pathways
including the death receptor pathway, caspase-dependent
pathway, caspase-independent pathway and the mitochondrial
pathway are initiated after SAH (Cahill et al., 2006).
Moreover, relationship between SENP3 and apoptosis was
discussed in several studies. It is proved that increased
expression of SENP3 restrained Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination
and consequential degradation in proteasome
(Nishida and Yamada, 2011). The expression of SENP3
increased in rat SCI model. And the co-localization of SENP3
and cleavage-caspase-3 was checked in the spinal cord (Wei
et al., 2012). It is indicated that depletion of SENP3 prolongs
Drp1 SUMOylation, which inhibited Drp1-mediated cytochrome
c release and caspase-mediated neurons death in
an ischemia model (Guo et al., 2013). In our pervious study, a
positive correlation between SENP3 and cleavage caspase-3
could be found through statistical analysis. In this study,
lentivirus was used to down-regulation the expression of
SENP3. Cleaved caspase 3 dropped following the silence of
SENP3 by lentivirus. Lv-null and normal saline did not occur
in same effect. TUNEL staining showed the changing of
apoptosis index, which was consistent with cleaved caspase
3. Therefore, it is concluded that SENP3 plays an important
role in apoptosis, especially in caspase 3 induced apoptotic

pathway. In SAH, when SENP3 accumulated by rising of
oxidative stress level, caspase 3 activated subsequently.
Thus, increased apoptotic level caused by SENP3 accumulation
may be a major reason for neural death after SAH.
Although increased SENP3 induces apoptosis that had been
reported in several studies, the target protein has not been
confirmed in SAH. Drp 1 was potential target, which was
mention above. However, we need further study to support
this assumption.
3.3. Summary
To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the role of
SENP3 in the brain after SAH. It is found that high oxidative
stress level following SAH induced rising of SENP3. In addition
, when SENP3 accumulated, caspase 3 activated subsequently.
And increased apoptotic level caused by SENP3
accumulation may be a major reason for neural death after
SAH. Drp 1 was potential target of SENP3 in SAH; however, we
need further proof to sustain this assumption.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Animal preparation
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–320 g) were acquired from
Animal Center of Jinling Hospital. The rats were raised on a
12-h dark–light cycle circumstance. They were free access to
food and water. All procedures were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nanjing University and accorded
to Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by
National Institutes of Health.
4.2. Lateral ventricle implantation of lentivirus with
shRNA
The lentivirus vectors were ordered from GenePharma Co.
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Lentivirus vectors for expression of a
scrambled shRNA and Rat SENP3 shRNA were designed. The
scrambled shRNA sequence was 5'-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3'.
The Rat SENP3 shRNA sequence was 5'-ACTGGCTCAATGACCAGGTGATGAACATG-3'.
The pGag/Pol, pRev,
pVSV-G plasmid mix (GenePharma Co. Ltd.) and plasmid
pGLV3/H1þPuro (GenePharma Co. Ltd.) were cotransfected
into HEK 293T cells. The final titer of recombinant virus was
adjusted to 1109TU/mL(both lv-SENP3 and lv-null).
The rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(50 mg/kg) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After essential disinfection
administration, 10 μl recombinant virus (lv-SENP3 or
lv-null) or normal saline was injected into rats' left lateral
ventricle using stereotaxic techniques (0.8 mm posterior,
1.5 mm lateral to the bregma and 3.7 mm below dural) by a
10 μL micro syringe(Shanghai Gaoge Industry & Trade Co.
Ltd., Shanghai, China). Seven days later, all implanted rats
were operated as SAH model.

4.3. Animal model of SAH
The prechiasmatic injection model was used to imitate SAH
(Jeon et al., 2010). Specifically, after intraperitoneal anesthesia
with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA), they were located prone in a stereotactic frame. After
careful disinfection treatment, a midline scalp incision was
taken and a 1 mm hole was drilled at 7.5 mm anterior to the
bregma in the midline, at an angle of 30E caudally. Then they
were turned into supine position. Carefully disinfecting
again, then we use insulin injection needle (BD Science) to
obtain 300 μl of their own blood from femoral artery. The
needle (BD Science) was advanced 11 mm into the prechiasmatic
cistern through this hole, and the blood was injected
into the prechiasmatic cistern over 20 s. Sham animals were
operated the same surgery process but not injection with
blood into the prechiasmatic cistern. After finishing these
procedures, 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution was injected subcutaneously
to prevent dehydration. And the rats were returned
to their cages. Sham group animals were operated sham
surgical procedures. All rats in both SAH group and Sham
group were sacrificed at 24 h after surgery.
4.4. Experimental groups
As shown in Fig. 1, there were two parts in this study. In total
108 rats were randomly allocated into 9 subgroups (4 in Part 1
and 5 in Part 2). The first part: Sham group, SAH group,
SAHþNAC group, and SAHþvehicle group. In the animals of
SAHþNAC group, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a sulfhydrylcontaining
antioxidant (Sigma Chemical Company (St.
Louis,MO, USA) was dissolved in 0.9% saline at concentrations
of 3%. And it (150 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally
at 5 min and 6 h after SAH induction. In the SAHþvehicle
group, the rats had SAH induced and were administrated
with the same volume of 0.9% saline at the corresponding
time point. The second part contained 5 subgroups: Sham
group, SAH group, SAHþlv-SENP3 group, SAHþlv-null group,
and SAHþNS group. In the groups SAHþlv-SENP3 and
SAHþlv-null, the lentivirus was implanted 7days before SAH

operation as mentioned above. In the SAHþNS group, 10 μl
0.9% saline was injected into the left lateral ventricle.
All animals were killed at 24 h after SAH surgery. Postassessments
included western blot, immunohistochemical
staining, TUNEL staining, fluorescence observation and biochemical
estimation.
4.5. Perfusion-fixation and tissue preparation
The rats were anesthetized as above, and perfused through
the left cardiacventricle with 0.9% NaCl solutions until the
effluent from the right atrium was clear. Animals which had
obvious clots in the prechiasmatic cistern were selected for
further analysis. Then blood clots on the brain tissue were
cleared; the temporal lobe tissue which was described in our
pervious study (Yang et al., 2015) near the hematoma was
obtained on ice and stored in 80 1C for western blot. For
TUNEL study, the rats were perfused with 0.9% NaCl solutions
, and then perfused 4% buffered paraformaldehyde; then
the brain was immersed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde 8 h
then embedded in paraffin.
4.6. Biochemical estimation
Malondialdehyde: the malondialdehyde(MDA) levels were
determined using the method of a previous study (Zhang
et al., 2014) in our lab. The principle of the assay depends on
the reaction of lipid peroxidation products with thiobarbituric
acid and formation of products called thiobarbituric acidreacting
substances, which give maximum absorbance at the
535-nm wavelength. The MDA concentrations were given as
nanomoles/milligram protein.
Superoxide Dismutase and Glutathione: total tissue superoxide
dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities and glutathione
(GSH) measurements were determined with a commercially
available kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute).
The measurement was performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Results were expressed as U/mg protein
(SOD) and mg/g protein (GSH), respectively, according to the
standard curves.
4.7. Western blot analysis
Completely homogenizing and centrifuging (at 14,000g for
15 min at 4 1C) of just enough brain tissues were prepared for
western blot analysis. Sequently, the supernate was collected.
The samples were added SDS sample buffer, followed
by boiling for 5 min at 100 1C. Samples (10μl/lane) were
separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
for 30 min at 80 V, then shift to 100 min at 110 V. When
electrophoresis was done, it was transferred onto PVDF for
2 h at 200 mA. The membrane was blocked with 5% defatted
milk for 2 h at room temperature, after that incubated with
anti-SENP3 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in 5% defatted milk, Cell
Signaling Technology), active caspase-3 (anti-rabbit, 1:500;
Cell Signaling, #9664) and β-actin (diluted 1:5000 in 5%
defatted milk, Bioworld, USA) at 4 1C with mild shaking for
8 h. Following washing for 10 min each for four times in
TBSþTween 20 (TBST), the membrane was incubated in the
appropriate secondary antibody (diluted1:5000 in TBST) for
2 h at room temperature. The chemiluminescence (ECL,
Thermo Scientific, USA) visualizes the blotted bands. And
the bands were exposed to X-ray photographic film. Relative
changes in protein expression were evaluated from the mean
pixel density by using UN-SCAN-IT, compared with β-actin,
and calculated as target protein expression/β-actin expression
ratios.
4.8. TUNEL
The apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL staining, which
was operated according to a previous study (Zhang et al.,
2014) in our lab. An in situ cell death detection kit, POD
(ISCDD, Boehringer Mannheim) was used. Briefly, the
formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned
at 4-mm thicknesses with a microtome. Then the
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed with
distilled water. The tissues were digested with 20 g/ml proteinase
K (Boehringer Mannheim) at room temperature for
15 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by
incubation in 0.3% H2 minutes. The sections were then
incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase at
37 1C for 60 min to add the digoxigenin-conjugated deoxyuridine
triphosphate to the 3ʹ-OH ends of fragmented DNA.
Antidigoxigenin antibody peroxidase was applied to the
sections to detect the labeled nucleotides. The sections were
stained with DAB and counterstained slightly with
hematoxylin.
4.9. Cell counting
One slice from every 6 serial cuttings in each segment was
selected, and altogether 6 slices were collected and observed
using the light microscope by 2 independent, experienced
pathologists who were blinded to the grouping. All positive
cells in each section were counted in 10 microscope fields
(magnification 400) throughout the identical regions of the
studied brain, and the mean number per visual field was
calculated.
4.10. Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean7SE. SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago) was applied for statistical analysis of the data. The
measurements were analyzed to ANOVA followed by Tukey's
post-hoc test. A value of po0.05 was considered as statistical
significance.
Conflict of interest
