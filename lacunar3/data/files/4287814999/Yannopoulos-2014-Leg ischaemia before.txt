Abstract
OBJECTIVES: Remote ischaemic preconditioning and its neuroprotective abilities are currently under investigation and the method has
shown significant effects in several small and large animal studies. In our previous studies, leucocyte filtration during cardiopulmonary
bypass reduced cerebrocortical adherent leucocyte count and mitigated cerebral damage after hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) in
piglets. This study aimed to obtain and assess direct visual data of leucocyte behaviour in cerebral vessels after hypothermic circulatory
arrest following remote ischaemic preconditioning.
METHODS: Twelve native stock piglets were randomized into a remote ischaemic preconditioning group (n= 6) and a control group
(n= 6). The intervention group underwent hind-leg ischaemia, whereas the control group received a sham-treatment before a 60-min
period of hypothermic circulatory arrest. An intravital microscope was used to obtain measurements from the cerebrocortical vessel in
vivo. It included three sets offilters: a violetfilter to visualize microvascular perfusion and vessel diameter, a greenfilter for visualization of
rhodamine-labelled leucocytes and an ultravioletfilter for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analysis. Thefinal magnification
on the microscope was 400. After the experiment, cerebral and cerebellar biopsies were collected and analysed with transmission
electron microscope by a blinded analyst.
RESULTS: In the transmission electron microscope analysis, the entire intervention group had normal, unaffected rough endoplasmic reticulum’s in their cerebellar tissue, whereas the control group had a mean score of 1.06 (standard deviation 0.41) (P= 0.026). The measured
amount of adherent leucocytes was lower in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group. The difference was statistically significant at 5,
15 and 45 min after circulatory arrest. Statistically significant differences were seen also in the recovery phase at 90 and 120 min after
reperfusion. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide autofluorescence had statistically significant differences at 10 min after cooling and at 120
and 180 min after hypothermic circulatory arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote ischaemic preconditioning seems to provide better mitochondrial respiratory chain function as indicated by the
higher NADH content. It simultaneously provides a reduction of adherent leucocytes in cerebral vessels after hypothermic circulatory
arrest. Additionally, it might provide some degree of cellular organ preservation as implied by the electron microscopy results.

INTRODUCTION
In surgery of complex congenital heart defects or in surgery of the
aortic arch normal circulation may be temporarily halted to
ensure a bloodless operating view. To mitigate ischaemic damage
to tissues such as the brain, simultaneous deep hypothermia (<18°
C) and isolated cerebral perfusion techniques are used. During the
last decade, numerous research groups have attempted to find
means of improving neurological outcomes after brain ischaemia or
trauma [1–4]. The concept of cerebral ischaemic preconditioning
and remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is still a relatively new
method and during the last decade, it has shown promise as a new
and efficient neuroprotective method in experimental settings [5,6].
Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and hypothermic circulatory
arrest (HCA) induce systemic inflammatory response through a
complex interplay of cellular and humoral mechanisms resulting in
capillary leakage, tissue oedema and end-organ dysfunction [7].
These responses include activation of complement, coagulation,
cytokine release, endothelial activation and expression of leucocyte
adhesion molecules [8]. It has been thought that reduced leucocyte
accumulation is associated with reduction of the ischaemic brain
injury [9,10]. In previous studies, this leucocyte adhesion in the wall †Equal contribution in article.

of cerebral microvascular bed caused exacerbated oedema formation
[11]. Further, accumulation of leucocytes incites their release of
oxygen-free radicals and proteolytic enzymes [12,13].
In our previous study, our data suggested a change in oxygen
consumption or metabolism, indicated by the fact that the HCA
group had an altered oxygen tension profile during HCA [14].
Additionally, leucocyte filtration has in our previous works shown
to improve brain protection and provide beneficial effects in this
setting [15, 16]. With an intravital microscope, we are able to
gather data associated with both intracerebral leucocytes and the
redox state of the neurones of the cortex. We can assess the redox
state of the mitochondria of the cerebral neurones with the intravital
microscope. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a
molecule that plays a vital role in the mitochondrial respiratory
chain of every cell. Crucially, via a phenomenon called autofluorescence
we can measure the amount of its reduced form, NADH.
This is important because if NADH fluorescence increases it directly
correlates with a worsened metabolic state of the mitochondria
[17–19]. It means that citric acid cycle, electron transport
chain (i.e. respiratory chain) and the formation of adenosine triphosphate
from adenosine diphosphate have slowed down as
NADH accumulates.
In this study, we aimed to study the effects of RIPC in cerebral
microcirculation through direct visualization with intravital microscopy.
With the use of three separate filters, we examined
vessel diameter changes, leucocyte behaviour and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) redox state. We also examined
cerebral and cerebellar samples with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) in order to analyse the effect of HCA and RIPC
on ultrastructural features of cerebral and cerebellar cells. We
hypothesized that some of the beneficial effects reported with
RIPC might be due to an altered leucocyte amount or a change in
NADH autofluorescence, perhaps even both.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental setting
Twelve female (6–7 weeks) piglets from a native stock were randomly
assigned to undergo 60 min of HCA at 18°C. Six of the
animals were randomized to undergo the 60 min of HCA with
right hind leg receiving transient RIPC preoperatively (RIPC
group), and six animals were randomized to undergo 60 min of
HCA without any preconditioning (control group). For a simplified
overview of the study protocol, refer to Fig.1.
Preoperative management
All the animals received humane care in accordance with the
‘Principles of Laboratory Animal Care’ formulated by the National
Society for Medical Research and the ‘Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals’ (http://www.nap.edu/catalog/5140.html).
The study was approved by the Research Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Oulu.
Anaesthesia protocol and cardiopulmonary bypass
In our studies, for the sake of comparability, we try to keep the anaesthesia
protocol and CPB protocol unchanged. In this study, the
anaesthesia protocol and cardiopulmonary procedures are identical
to the ones described in our earlier study [14].
Remote ischaemic preconditioning
Preconditioning was induced by applying a static pressure of 250
mmHg with a paediatric blood pressure cuff that was wrapped
around the right hind leg. The cuff was inflated as proximally as
possible, involving most of the thigh and all the tissues distally as to
induce a maximum amount of tissue ischaemia in the hind leg.
Four cycles of 5-min ischaemia intermittent with three 5-min
reperfusion periods were completed. CPB was initiated 60 min
after the RIPC, and HCA was achieved in 90 min from the end of
the RIPC cycle. The control group had the blood pressure cuff
wrapped around the hind leg, but not inflated, for the same period.
Cranial procedures
The piglets were positioned on their left side and secured. A
cranial window (30 × 30 mm) was created over the right temporal
cerebral cortex with a 14/11 mm disposable cranial perforator
(200–253 DGR-II, Acra-Cut, Inc., Acton, MA, USA) for intravital microscopy.
A probe was inserted medially through the same cranial
window to monitor intracerebral temperature (Licox CC1.P1;
Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) throughout the experiment.
Intracranial temperature readings were recorded at regular
intervals during cooling and rewarming perfusion and 10-min
interval during HCA.
Intravital microscopy
An intravital microscope (Leica Model MZFL III; Leica, Heerbrugg,
Switzerland) was placed over the cranial window. Three sets of
filters were used: a violet filter, a green filter and an ultraviolet
filter for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide analysis. The
image was captured by a video camera. A frame grabber (Kudo
Interactive Frame Grabber; Kudo Interactive, Westminster, CO,
USA) and a computer-assisted image analysis system (Scion
Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) were used for analysis. The final
magnification on the monitor was 400 times. At baseline, the
piglet received a 2 ml (4 mg/ml) loading dose of rhodamine 6G
chloride MW 479 (Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO, USA) 5 min
before the initial recording. Arterial and venous cerebrocortical

Preoperative preparation included anaesthesia induction, donor blood collection
, priming of the CPB, invasive haemodynamic monitoring, cranial procedures
, thoracotomy and baseline measurements when aforementioned
preparations had been completed. For the control group animals, there was no
RIPC performed between pre-op and CPB. After rewarming, the heart was
decannulated and the thoracotomy closed. Blood samples and intravital microscope
recordings were taken at several time points. Upward arrows represent
time points. Pre-op: preoperative; RIPC: remote ischaemic preconditioning;

microvessels with a rough diameter of 0.2–1.0 mm were chosen
for the measurements. The vessel chosen were visible without any
magnification and the diameters were calculated using the known
magnification of the microscope.
Violet filter. When a suitable fieldof visionwithbothanartery
and a venous vessel was discovered, a 1 ml (50 mg/ml) intravenous
bolus of fluorescein isothiocyanate (150 kDa; Fluka Chemicals, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was administered to label the plasma of the
cerebral vessels, and a recording was made with the violet filter of
the microscope.
Green filter. The piglet received a 1 ml (4 mg/ml) intravenous
bolus of rhodamine to stain the activated leucocytes in the
circulation. A recording was made with the green filter. The exact
number of adherent leucocytes was calculated from an easily
determined portion of the vessel, and the number of cells was then
related to the surface area of the vessel. The analysis was made by
an investigator unaware of the protocol by using both still pictures
and videotapes. For rolling leucocytes, a specific point of the vessel
was selected, and the number of leucocytes rolling past that point
was observed during10–15 s in each recording.
Ultraviolet filter. The monitoring of NADH is based on the
absorption difference of NADH and the oxidized form of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The NAD+ does not absorb light at
320–380 nm, but NADH does. Thefluorescence emission of NADH
is peaked near 450 nm, as described in previous studies [20].
The epi-illumination was limited to <1 min to avoid thermal
injury, and the epi-illumination was always stopped between video
recordings.
Biochemical data
Blood gas values, pH, electrolytes, complete blood cell counts,
plasma lactate levels, serum ionized calcium, glucose, haematocrit
and haemoglobin levels were measured at baseline, at the end of
cooling (immediately before institution of HCA), and at 30 min, 1 h,
2 h and 3 h after the start of rewarming (i-STAT Analyzer; i-STAT
Corporation, East Windsor, NJ, USA). Baseline measurements were
taken after anaesthesia, cranial procedures, invasive haemodynamic
monitoring had been started and the thoracotomy had been performed
, but no cardiac manipulation or cannulation had taken place.
Additionally, central temperature readings, urine amount, amount of
fluids infused and amount of donor blood were recorded.
Transmission electron microscopy
Specimens for TEM were collected from the right cerebral cortex
of temporal lobe and right cerebellar cortex 3 h postoperatively.
The specimen from cerebrum was taken from the same spot the
intravital microscopy had taken place. After collecting the specimens
, the animals were euthanized using pentobarbital (60 mg/
kg) while anesthetized. Also specimens were collected from one
animal, which did not undergo HCA (zero-control), in order
to compare the TEM results with a tissue unaffected by HCA.
All specimens were immediately fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 4%
formaldehyde mixture in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. They were
post-fixed in 1% osmiumtetroxide, dehydrated in acetone and
embedded in Epon LX 112 (Ladd Research Industries, Williston, VT,
USA). Thin sections were cut with Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome,
stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in Tecnai G2
Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI Europe, Eindhoven,
Netherlands). Images were captured by Veleta CCD camera
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Munster, Germany).
Electron microscope score for ischaemia-related
ultrastructural changes in cerebral and cerebellar
cells
A blinded experienced analyst assessed three factors in cerebral
and cerebellar TEM samples. The three factors analysed were:
ultrastructure, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and mitochondria.
Ultrastructural changes included neuroglial cells and neurones
, and any structural changes in astrocytic perivascular
endfeet. The observed mitochondrial changes were swelling, disrupted
crystal integrity and loss of matrix density, the observed
changes in RER were dilatation and the presence of vacuoles and
the observed changes in the ultrastructural features of astrocytes
were swelling of astrocytic soma and perivascular endfeet, ruptured
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes and electron
lucent cytoplasm. Structural alterations were scored as follows:
normal = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3. The total score
was summed of these three scores for both cerebrum and cerebellum
, yielding a maximum score of 18.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA) statistical software packages. Continuous and ordinal
variables are expressed as mean values with standard deviation
(SD) in parenthesis or median values with 25th–75th percentile.
Either the Student t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test was used to
assess P-values for continuous variables between the groups. The
repeatedly measured data were analysed using a linear mixed
model with patients fitted as random, and the best covariance
pattern was chosen according to Akaike’s information criteria.
Two-tailed significance levels are reported. Reported P-values are
as follows: P between groups (P×g) indicates a level of difference
between the groups; P for time (P×t) indicating difference and
changes during time; Pfor time by group (P
t×g
), indicates behaviour
difference between the groups within time.
RESULTS
Comparison of study groups
The median weight of the animals was 19.0 kg (17.4–20.5 kg), with no
statistically significant differences between groups. Baseline haemoglobin
differed significantly between groups (P= 0.004). The haemoglobin
in the RIPC group was 88.5 g/l (82.0–92.0 g/l) and in the control group
76.5 g/l (71.0–78.0 g/l). The pigs were given 61.9 ml/kg (54.9–70.1 ml/
kg) donor blood, with no significant difference between groups.
Experimental and metabolic data are given in Table1.
Blood gas analysis and electrolyte content were comparable
preoperatively, with only significant difference at PCO
2
, which was
slightly higher in the control group than in the RIPC group: 5.53
kPa (5.46–5.60) and 5.33 kPa (4.86–5.36), respectively (P< 0.05).

There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure,
central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
between the groups at the baseline. Troponin I levels were at the
baseline similar between groups.
Temperatures
Blood, rectal and intracerebral temperatures had no statistically significant differences preoperatively and during HCA. The only significant
difference at 2 h after HCA, when blood temperature was
lower in the control group compared with the RIPC group: 35.8°C
(35.7–36.8°C) and 37.4°C (36.1–37.7°C), respectively (P< 0.05).
However, that difference was rectified by the last time point.
Systemic blood cell count
Total leucocyte count in blood was in the RIPC group 24.4 × 109/l
(16.1 × 109/l–25.7 × 109/l) and in the control group 18.0 × 109/l
(16.9 × 109/l–21.4 × 109/l) at the baseline, with no statistically significant difference between groups (Table1).
Intravital microscopy
There were no statistically significant differences in arterial vessel
calibres at any time points. The diameter of selected venous
vessels did not differ significantly at any time point during the experiment.
Vessel diameter
The calculated vessel diameters of selected arteries were 0.36 mm
(0.33 mm–0.42 mm) in the RIPC group and 0.38 mm (0.26 mm–0.51
mm) in the control group, at baseline with no statistically significant
difference between groups. There were no statistically significant differences
in arterial vessel calibres at any time points. The diameters
of venous vessels were 0.57 mm (0.46 mm–0.66 mm) at baseline in
the RIPC group and 0.77 mm (0.73 mm–0.78 mm) in the control
group. (P= 0.12) at baseline. The diameter of selected venous vessels
did not differ significantly at any time point during the experiment.
Adherent leucocytes and rolling leucocytes
Absolute cerebral leucocyte count in the cerebrocortical vessels
had no statistical significant differences between the study groups.
A number of adherent leucocytes referred to baseline was lower
in the RIPC group and the difference was statistically significant at
several time points (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences
between groups in rolling leucocyte amount.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
autofluorescence
The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) autofluorescence
was statistically significantly higher 2 and 3 h postoperatively
in the control group. During the cooling phase, values increased
slightly in both groups. Similarly, autofluorescence values increased
in both groups at the reperfusion phase. The differences were significant
in 10 min of cooling (P= 0.047), 2 h postoperatively (P=0.023)
and 3 h postoperatively (P= 0.002) as shown in Fig.3.
Transmission electron microscopy
The total score of both cerebral and cerebellar changes in the
control group was 9.66 (SD 1.71) and in the RIPC group 7.66 (SD
1.40) (P= 0.54). Statistically significant differences were seen in the

RER analysis of the cerebellar samples. All of RIPC animals had
ultra-structurally normal RERs in their cerebellar tissue whereas
the control groups animals had a mean score of 1.06 (SD 0.41)
(P= 0.026). For comparative purposes, a sham porcine was operated
that did not undergo HCA but only similar anaesthesia with
similar surgical procedures. The cerebral score of the shamcontrol
animal was 3, the cerebellar score was 0.5, summing up
the total score to 3.5.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that RIPC reduces the number of the adherent
leucocytes referred to the baseline in the cerebral vessels
of a piglet after a period of deep HCA and preserves better mitochondrial
respiratory function in the brain. These results were
observed directly from in vivo intravital microscopy data. Due to
the in vivo method, it was difficult to find identical cerebrocortical
vessels with similar diameters between experimental animals.
Therefore, we felt it was more prudent to compare the measured
leucocytes with the baseline values. The same vessels were used
for measurements in one experiment at all the subsequent time
points. The cerebral mean leucocyte count right after transient
RIPC is noticeably lower in the RIPC group (Fig. 2). This indicates
that RIPC could have an effect on leucocyte migration and adherence
although we cannot verify this as we did not measure leucocyte
activation and reactivity in vitro. This effect is probably due to
the production of the anti-inflammatory substances and reduction
of the antioxidant activity [21,22].
In our previous studies, leucocyte filtration during CPB reduced
cerebrocortical adherent leucocyte count and mitigated cerebral
damage after HCA in piglets [15, 16]. RIPC could possibly provide
similar benefits by reducing leucocyte accumulation in the cortical
blood vessels of the brain. Additionally, RIPC has been
documented to decrease vascular resistance and endothelial dysfunction
in the early phases of ischaemia, which may partially
explain this finding [23]. Interestingly, the total systemic white
blood cell counts were actually higher in the RIPC group at 1–3h
postoperatively, while the cerebral leucocyte count was lower
than in the control group. Obviously, a higher temperature
increases the number of rolling and adherent leucocytes in itself
[24] but at 2 h postoperatively the control group was cooler than
the RIPC group and nonetheless the leucocytes counts in cerebral
vessels were higher at that time. There were no statistically significant
differences between the groups in intracerebral, rectal or
blood temperatures, which add to the credibility of the result. This
observation could indicate that RIPC does not have beneficial
effects on total leucocyte count but could possibly reduce accumulation
of leucocytes to the brain. It also implies that systemic white
blood cell count may not directly correlate with the numbers of leucocytes
in the brain.
As expected after long HCA and reperfusion, alterations in cerebral
and cerebellar ultrastructure were evident. However, only one
statistically significant difference between groups was measured.
The control group had a higher cerebellar RER score than RIPC.
The clinical relevance of this finding, however, remains unclear as
it is an isolated result in our data. TEM score showed considerable
variability in the severity of alterations, as analysed changes varied
from non-detectable to severe in individual animals within both
experimental groups.
NADH autofluorescence measurements can be used to measure
in vivo the redox state of the mitochondria [17]. The increase of
reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) autofluorescence
implicates worse tissue oxygenation [18] and maximal NADH
autofluorescence readings are measured in anoxic conditions [19].

Although, haemoglobin had a statistically significant difference at
baseline (Table 1); the difference was nullified in subsequent time
points. This is important because haemoglobin differences can
cause artefacts in NAD+/NADH autofluorescence measurements
[17]. A higher NADH autofluorescence directly correlates with a
worsened metabolic state of the mitochondria and worsened respiratory
chain function [17–19]. A worsened respiratory chain function
in turn correlates with an increase in reactive oxygen species
production and cellular protein and membrane peroxidation [25].
RIPC has been studied more in other organs besides the brain,
although it has shown some advantageous effects in brain protection
in studies performed with small rodents. Our previous results
[5,6,14] combined with the current study result are, to our knowledge
, the first studies utilizing large animals that have shown
beneficial results with RIPC conferring resistance against global ischaemia
of the brain. Some studies with RIPC and the protection
of other organs, such as the heart, have even reached small-scale
clinical human trials. However, RIPC has not yet been studied in
humans with cases of global brain ischaemia.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RIPC reduces the
number of adherent leucocytes in the cerebral topical circulation
after HCA. Additionally, the NADH autofluorescence result indicates
that the RIPC group had a better respiratory chain function
during the recovery phase. It is important to keep in mind that our
study has limitations; first, due to the nature of an acute study we
lack any conclusive histological or behavioural evidence that these
effects are indeed beneficial. Secondly, this study involved a small
number of animals and due to this a few outlier results can sway
the data either way.
Nonetheless, we feel that our study warrants long-term studies
that include detailed immunological and white blood cell analysis
in conjunction with RIPC. We hope that large animal studies with
RIPC and brain protection could form a steppingstone between
the animal studies performed with the use of rodents and possible
future human clinical trials with RIPC and global ischaemia.
