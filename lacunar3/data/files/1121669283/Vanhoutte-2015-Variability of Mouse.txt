Abstract We studied intraobserver (n=24), interobserver
(n=24) and interexperiment (n=12) reproducibility of left
ventricular (LV) mass and volume measurements in mice
using an 11.7 T MRI system. The LV systolic function was
assessed with a short-axis FLASH-cine sequence in 29 mice,
including animals having undergone transverse aortic constriction.
Bland-Altman and regression analysis were used to
compare the different data sets. Reproducibility was excellent
for the LV mass and end-diastolic volume (coefficient of variability
(CoV) between 5.4 and 11.8 %), good for end-systolic
volume (CoV 15.2–19.4 %) and moderate for stroke volume
and ejection fraction (CoV 14.7–20.9 %). We found an excellent
correlation between LV mass determined by MRI and
ex vivo morphometric data (r=0.92). In conclusion, LV systolic
function can be assessed on an 11.7 T MRI scanner with
high reproducibility for most parameters, as needed in longitudinal
studies. However, data should be interpreted taking
into account the moderate reproducibility of small volumes.

Introduction
With heart diseases as the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in Western countries, cardiovascular research
remains the prime importance in the field of scientific
research [1]. In this context, recent developments in genetic,
surgical and pharmacological modalities have led to a wider
selection of animal models, especially small rodents, allowing
us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of

cardiovascular diseases and to study new therapeutic interventions.
However, characterization of the mouse cardiac phenotype
remains challenging because of a small heart size—myocardial
mass is 2000-fold smaller than human [2]—and rapid heart rate
(400–600 beats/min).
The development of high-field MRI offers a valuable alternative
to high-frequency echocardiography because of its potential
higher reproducibility, the numerous imaging sequences available
allowing specific investigations (biventricular function, fibrosis
and viability, wall motion abnormalities) as well as the
relatively non-invasive aspect of the technique, making it ideal
for longitudinal monitoring of small animals [2–8]. Over time,
the progression of the magnetic field strength of MRI scanners,
from3to11.7T,hasledtoabettersignal-to-noiseratioandan
improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution. There are
currently more than 40 MR systems installed worldwide operatingat7Torhigher
[ 9].
Even if regularly used to study experimental models of cardiovascular
diseases, data related to the reproducibility of left
ventricular systolic function assessment in mice with these
high-field magnets are limited. To our best knowledge, studies
existing either used very small groups of animals (n<10)
[10–12], only rats [12, 13], field strength under 7 T [14]or
vertical bores [11–13]. They further only focused on the intraand
interobserver reproducibility or compared segmentation
techniques [14, 15]; only one study by Stuckey et al. reported
interexperimental reproducibility data on a group of 12 rats [13].
Such data are crucial to establish whether this technique is
routinely applicable to mouse models, especially in dynamic
studies using repeated acquisitions [16], and to determine how
it compares to high-frequency echocardiographic analysis. In
this study, our goals were to evaluate the intraobserver, interobserver
and interexperiment variability of left ventricular
(LV) mass and volumes in mice with an 11.7 T horizontal bore
MR system and to compare these MRI data with ex vivo morphometric
measurements.
Methods
Animals
29 C57Bl/6J male mice (Janvier, Paris) aged 10–28 weeks
were studied. Mice were housed under standard conditions
with ad libitum access to water and chow.
Surgical Procedures
Eleven mice have undergone minimally invasive transverse
aortic constriction (TAC) to produce various degrees of cardiac
hypertrophy [17, 18] in order to study the experimental
variability of the technique in a wider range of
physiopathological conditions (namely, with a wider spectrum
of LV hypertrophy).
Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of a mixture of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)
and placed in supine position. Under a microscope, an incision
was performed on the right side of the sternum in order to
avoid injury to the mammary artery. The thymus was pushed
aside, and a constrictive band was placed and tightened
around the aorta and a 27-G blunted needle, which was then
removed. The ligature was not tightened in sham-operated
mice. Chest was closed with a polypropylene suture.
Thirteen mice were used as sham animals, and another 5 were
control mice, for a total of 29 animals studied.
CMR Image Acquisition
Experiments were performed on an 11.7 T MRI system dedicated
to small animal applications (Biospec, Bruker, Ettlingen,
Germany). A quadrature 1H resonator was used for radiofrequency
transmission (inner diameter=72 mm, length=6.6 cm)
in conjunction with a surface receive-only coil array (length=
10.7 cm). All animals underwent at least one MRI examination.
In the previously operated mice,the imaging took place 8 weeks
after the surgical procedure. In 12 animals, the procedure was
repeated twice, with a maximum interval of 24 h.
The animals were anaesthetized in an induction chamber
by exposure to isoflurane 3 %. The isoflurane was then maintained
between 0.5 and 3 % during the entire procedure in
order to get a steady cardiac frequency around 500 beats/
min [19]. Mice were placed in prone position and monitored
for electrocardiogram and respiration with neonatal electrodes
wrapped around the paws and a specific pillow placed under
the animal. Examinations were performed in a temperaturecontrolled
setting, with a rectal probe and a dedicated heating
blanket.
Cardiac scout images were obtained in the conventional
planes with a tripilot sequence. An intragate 2D cine Fast
Low Angle Shot (FLASH) sequence was applied to acquire
a set of seven to eight 1-mm-thick contiguous short-axis images
covering the entire ventricles, perpendicular to the LV
long axis. The following parameters were set: repetition time,
5.83 ms; echo time, 1.45 ms; flip angle, 25°; field of view,
30.0×30.0 mm; and matrix size, 256×256, resulting in an inplane
resolution of 0.12×0.12 mm2, with an acquisition time
of approximately 9 min, and 10 frames per cardiac cycle.
CMR Image Analysis
The LV systolic function was assessed from the stack of shortaxis
images by tracing epicardial and endocardial borders, including
papillary muscles, on the Segment software
(Medviso®v1.8, Lund, Sweden) [20]. End-diastolic (EDV),
end-systolic (ESV) and stroke volume (SV) were determined

(μl). LV ejection fraction (EF, in %) and LV mass (mg) were
subsequently deduced. Twenty-four stacks of images were read
twice by the same observer and once by an independent observer.
The 24 series of images resulting from repeated acquisitions
on the same animals were read by the first observer. The average
time for image post-processing was about 15 min per animal.
All analyses were performed on a blinded basis.
Morphometric Measurements
One week after the MRI procedure, mice were sacrificed.
Their body weight, heart weight, left ventricular mass and
tibial length (TL) were measured.
Statistical Analysis
Since most data were treated retrospectively, the 29 animals
studied have not all been included in the various analysis
groups. For intra- and interobserver variability, the same 24
mice were studied, including 13 sham and 11 TAC animals.
For interexperiment variability, 12 animals were studied, including
3 sham, 4 TAC (also included in the intra- and interobserver
analysis) and 5 control animals.
For intraobserver variability, the same stack of images was
read twice by the same observer (data sets 1 and 1′). For
interobserver variability, the same stack of images was read
blindly by two independent observers (data sets 1 and 2). For
interexperiment variability, two different stacks of images

acquired in the same animal were read by the first observer
(data sets 3 and 3′).
The mean and standard deviation of each parameter were
computed in each group. Agreement between intraobserver,
interobserver and interexperiment measurements was
assessed by means of the Bland and Altman test [21] that plots
the difference between the two measurements against the average
of the two methods. The bias corresponds to the mean
difference. The limits of agreement were estimated using the
mean bias between the two readings plus or minus twice the
standard deviation of the differences (SDD). The difference
between the two measurements will be within these limits for
95 % of observations. The coefficient of variability (CoV)
corresponds to the SDD divided by the mean of the measurements
and multiplied by 100 %. It represents the percentage of
dispersion of the measurements.
Unpaired Student’s t test was used for intergroup comparison
, including a comparative analysis of morphological and
functional data (MRI data set 1) obtained for sham (n=13) and
TAC mice (n=11). Paired t test was used to compare
intraobserver, interobserver and interexperiment results for
each parameter.

A Pearson correlation was calculated in order to compare
in vivo MRI data (data set 2) and ex vivo morphometric measurements
of the LV mass and LV/TL ratio for the 13 sham
and 11 TAC animals. A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed
with GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, USA).
Results
Using the CMR imaging protocol described above, highgrade
quality images were obtained in all animals (Fig. 1).
Baseline Characteristics
Quantitative data were in line with previously published results
[10, 11, 14–16, 19]. As expected, LV mass was significantly
higher in the 11 animals with transverse aortic constriction
and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in the 13 sham
animals. When using the LV mass/tibial length ratio (LV/
TL), which normalizes the LV mass to the body size, sham
mice showed a ratio of 4.7±0.1 and 3.8±0.1 mg/mm for morphometric
and MRI measurements, respectively, and TAC
mice showed a ratio of 6.5±0.4 and 5.4±0.3, respectively,
demonstrating a clearly different cardiac phenotype between
both groups (p<0.05, Fig. 2). Detailed cardiac functional parameters
and LV mass measurements for the sham and TAC
groups are summarized in Table1.
Intraobserver, Interobserver and Interexperiment
Variability of MRI Data
The mean±SD values of all morphometric data as well as the
Bland-Altman analysis were obtained for the 29 animals studied.
Detailed results are displayed in Table 2 and Fig. 3.We
did not find statistically significant differences between the
mean values of LV mass, LV/TL ratio, LV EDV, LV ESV,
LV SV and LV EF when comparing the various sets of data
(p>0.05).
As expected, the SDD, and hence the limits of agreement,
were smaller for all parameters in the intraobserver study,
whereas the least clustered data were found in the
interexperiment study, with similar to larger confidence interval
compared to the interobserver study.
Using the Bland and Altman analysis, high reproducibility
was found for LV mass, LV/TL and EDV, with a notably low
intraobserver CoVof 5.4 % for all these parameters and CoV
<12 % in the interexperiment study, suggesting that these can
effectively be used in longitudinal studies. Good agreement
was found for EF, with a CoV between 14.7 % in the interobserver
study and 15.5 % in the interexperiment study. The
small volumes suffered the most variability, with
intermodality CoV between 15.2 and 20.9 % for ESV and
SV, which implies that they are more difficult to quantify
accurately and could be of limited value when measured during
repeated acquisitions.
Linear Regression Analysis
Linear regression analysis for all mice revealed an adequate
intraobserver, interobserver and interexperiment correlation
for LV/TL, EDV, ESVand EF with R-square ranging between
0.67 and 0.95. Correlation for SV was the weakest of all parameters
, with R-square between 0.30 (interobserver study)
and 0.67 (intraobserver study). The line of best fit intercepted
the origin for most measurements, and when not, the correlation
remained significant, with a b
0
significantly different
from zero. The scatter plots with individual regression line,
95 % confidence interval, R-squares and corresponding pvalues
are provided in Fig. 4.
Correlation Between In Vivo MRI and Ex Vivo
Morphometric LV Mass Measurements
We demonstrated a strong correlation between LV mass
measurements by LV mass weighing or high-field CMR
imaging (data set 2), with a Pearson correlation (r) of 
0.92 for both LV mass and LV/TL ratio (p<0.05,
Fig. 5). Of note, MRI data in absolute values were
always smaller than morphometric data.
Discussion
In cardiovascular imaging, variations within and between observers
and between different acquisitions remain an important
issue when evaluating in vivo data. This is particularly
relevant when experimental groups are studied longitudinally
to test a new hypothesis.
Up to now, high-frequency echocardiography
remained the most widely used technique to characterize
the cardiac phenotype of rodents. Although few data are
available in the literature on its reproducibility [22–25],
it is generally accepted that its intra- and interobserver
variability is low for most ventricular measurements
(<20 %, [26]). However, it is also known that this method is
less efficient in the presence of abnormal ventricular geometry
and heterogeneous regional myocardial function [26–28]asit
is often the case in animal models of cardiovascular diseases.

interexperiment correlations between two readings for LV/TL, EDV,

correlation for all intraobserver data, but moderate correlation in SV and

Approaches such as echocardiography using geometrical assumptions
to evaluate left ventricular function are not as accurate
as data coming from a full volume acquisition, as
it is the gold standard in CMR imaging [15]. In a rat
model of myocardial infarction, Stuckey et al. showed
that 2D echo was indeed less reproducible than 11.7 T
MRI [13] in a vertical bore magnet acquiring 28–40
frames per heart cycle.
Studies comparing measurements obtained by echocardiography
and MRI in a model are scarce [13, 28], but overall,
they suggest that end-diastolic dimensions and LV wall thickness
are poorly correlated. This could be at least in part explained
by the better delineation of cardiac trabeculations in
CMR imaging and better temporal resolution [27]. Similarly,
studies comparing left ventricular function in mice by MRI or
conductance microcatheter (Millar) have shown a striking underestimation
of absolute volumetric values with the catheter
method [29, 30] influenced by the calibration technique used
[30]. These pitfalls further suggest that it is not wise to compare
LV measurements obtained with different techniques in
various experimental groups.
Development of ultra-high-field MRI systems (≥7.0 T)
over the past decade has brought new perspectives in small
animal imaging. As there is a direct relationship between the
main field strength (B
0
) and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N),
higher field provides better imaging quality and improves
spatial and temporal resolution or acquisition speed. Hence,
most pioneering CMR laboratories currently work on 7 or 9 T
systems [9], and they are likely to transition to even higher
fields in the near future. If some reproducibility data on CMR
in rodents are available, they mainly report very small numbers
of animals (n<10) [10–12], including rats [12, 13], field
strengths ≤7 T [ 14] or vertical bores [11–13], the latter
representing a less physiological environment. Overall, this
does not really reflect the current use of ultra-high-field MRI
for the characterization of experimental models in cardiovascular
research. Moreover, interexperiment variability is usually
not evaluated in most studies, including the work of
Heijman et al. [14] reporting the most sizable number of mice
(n=22) at 6.3 T. Therefore, we believe that our reproducibility
data obtained with a horizontal bore at 11.7 T on a group of
more than 25 mice bring additional material for the validation
of the technique.
In our study, purposedly including healthy mice and a model
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, intraobserver, interobserver
and interexperiment reproducibility was good for LV mass,
LV/TL and EDV (CoV between 5.4 and 11.8 %). These results
are consistent with the few data available in the experimental
field [10–15], although the use of different statistical
tests does not allow a thorough comparison. Coefficients of
variability remain higher than those obtained in humans [31].
If the reproducibility of ESV, SV and EF is less satisfactory,
various factors may account for these differences. First, contour
tracings in the basal and apical sections of the heart are
often subject to interpretation at the time of post-processing
because myocardial limits are less clearly visible at these
levels. Secondly, at least when studying interexperiment variability
, an additional potential source of error in the determination
of volumes could have been introduced by the partial
volume effect due to a finite slice thickness. Finally, and above
all, there was an important scale effect: any tiny variation
in measurements had enormous repercussions on
the reproducibility of the data, as it related to very
small volumes (μl). This explains why the smallest volumes
, especially the SV, suffered the most variability.
This highlights the need to develop stronger sequences to
adequately measure SVand cardiac output in mice. In particular
, a phase-contrast angiography sequence applied on the
ascending aorta could be more appropriate for direct measurement
of the SVand, subsequently, the EF [32].
When morphometric and CMR imaging LV measurements
were compared, both showed a strong correlation and were
able to demonstrate similar differences in LV mass or LV/TL
between our experimental groups. However, LV mass estimated
by CMR was consistently smaller in absolute values than
those obtained ex vivo. The 1-week delay between MRI examination
and sacrifice for morphometric evaluation could in
part account for this discrepancy. However, this is also very
likely related to the great accuracy of CMR post-processing,
allowing to exclude intraventricular blood and tissues not belonging
to the LV from the analysis, whereas those may have
been mistakenly included in the morphometric measurements.

Conclusions
This study showed that the mouse LV systolic function can be
assessed on an 11.7 T MRI scanner, with an excellent reproducibility
of LV mass and end-diastolic volumes analysis,
allowing longitudinal phenotypic evaluation of animals with
healthy or hypertrophic myocardium. Furthermore, in vivo LV
mass MRI measurements were constantly in line with ex vivo
morphometric data, bringing evidence that high-field CMR
imaging is not only reproducible but also accurate.
Development of new CMR imaging sequences remains a
great challenge for the future, as it will allow more detailed
non-invasive characterizations of animal models. Here, we
highlight the need to interpret CMR data by taking into account
their shortcomings, focusing on LV mass and LV EDV
as parameters that are not only the most reproducible but also
the most relevant in various pathophysiological conditions
such as cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy.
