Abstract
High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was initially described as
a damage-associated-molecular-pattern (DAMP) mediator that
worsens acute brain injury after stroke. But, recent findings
suggest that HMGB1 can play a surprisingly beneficial role
during stroke recovery by promoting endothelial progenitor cell
(EPC) function and vascular remodeling in cortical gray
matter. Here, we ask whether HMGB1 may also influence
EPC responses in white matter injury. The standard lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC) injection model was used to
induce focal demyelination in the corpus callosum of mice.
Immunostaining showed that within the focal white matter
lesions, HMGB1 was up-regulated in GFAP-positive reactive
astrocytes, along with the accumulation of Flk1/CD34-doublepositive
EPCs that expressed pro-recovery mediators such
as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and basic fibroblast
growth factor. Astrocyte–EPC signaling required the HMGB1
receptor RAGE as treatment with RAGE-neutralizing antibody
significantly decreased EPC accumulation. Moreover, suppression
of HMGB1 with siRNA in vivo significantly decreased
EPC numbers in damaged white matter as well as proliferated
endothelial cell numbers. Finally, in vitro cell culture systems
confirmed that HMGB1 directly affected EPC function such as
migration and tube formation. Taken together, our findings
suggest that HMGB1 from reactive astrocytes may attract
EPCs to promote recovery after white matter injury.

The pathophysiology of stroke and brain injury is highly
complex. Both acute as well as chronic responses after
injury involve multifactorial interactions between all cells in
the neurovascular unit, comprising neuronal, glial, and
vascular compartments (Carmichael 2006; Zhang and Chopp
2009; Moskowitz et al. 2010). More recently, it has been
proposed that beyond cell–cell signaling within the brain per
se, dynamic cross-talk between brain and systemic responses
such as circulating blood cells may also be important
(Meisel et al. 2005; Offner et al. 2006, 2009; Titova et al.
2008; Ma et al. 2010). In particular, endothelial progenitor
cells (EPCs) that circulate in peripheral blood can be
activated after stroke and these responses may significantly
influence stroke outcome (Taguchi et al. 2004; Fan et al.
2010).
EPC function, migration, and homing can be regulated
by many different factors, including high-mobility group box
1 (HMGB1) (Chavakis et al. 2007). HMGB1 is a highly
conserved non-histone nuclear DNA-binding protein, and

widely expressed in most eukaryotic cells including neural
cells (Yang et al. 2005). Traditionally, HMGB1 was
proposed as a nuclear and cellular danger signal belonging
to the damage-associated-molecular-pattern (DAMP) family
of alarmins (Lotze and Tracey 2005). HMGB1 can be
passively released from damaged cells and promote inflammation
and cell death (Goldstein et al. 2006; Faraco et al.
2007). But, while HMGB1 promotes injury in the acute phase
after stroke, it may surprisingly show some beneficial effects
in the chronic phase during recovery. HMGB1 signaling can
promote endothelial activation and sprouting (Treutigeret al.
2003; Schlueter et al. 2005), and increase neurite outgrowth
and cell survival (Passalacqua et al. 1998; Huttunen et al.
2000, 2002). Recently, our group showed that HMGB1 can be
released from reactive astrocytes that augment EPC function
and neurovascular remodeling in gray matter after stroke
(Hayakawa et al. 2012a). In this study, we now ask whether
HMGB1 might also promote EPC responses in white matter.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Human recombinant HMGB1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).
Antibodies
CD34 (1 : 100, Genway Biotech, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA), Flk-1
(VEGFR2) (1 : 100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), receptor for
advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) (1 : 200, Abcam), Brainderived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (1 : 200, Abcam), and
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (1 : 200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used for flow cytometry analysis.
HMGB1 antibody (1 : 500, Abcam) and GFAP antibody (1 : 500,
BD biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used for western blot or
immunohistochemistry.
In vivo white matter injury model
This study was performed following an institutionally approved
protocol in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.
For all experiments, group allocation, treatments, and assessments
were randomized and blinded. Three to five animals were prepared
for each group in this study. Male C57BL6 mice (11–12 weeks,
Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA,
USA) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1% to 2%) in 30%/70%
oxygen/nitrous oxide during operation. Lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC from Sigma) at a concentration of 10 lg/lL or 0.5 lL saline
was injected, through a 30-gauge needle over 5 min, into the left
corpus callosum. The placement coordinates were anterior: 0.5 mm
from bregma, lateral: 1.0 mm from bregma, depth: 2.3 mm from the
skull surface. Mouse RAGE antibody (50 mg/kg, R&D systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(0.1 mL/10 g) was injected intraperitoneally on day 1 and day 3
after LPC injection.
siRNA infusions in mouse brain
Three days after LPC injection, mice were stereotaxically injected
with control siRNA or HMGB1 siRNA through the intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) route. The placement coordinates for the left
lateral ventricle were anteroposterior: 0.5 mm from bregma, lateral:
0.8 mm from bregma, depth: 2.5 mm from the skull surface.
Control siRNA and HMGB1 siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. The HMGB1 siRNA is a pool of three targetspecific19 –25 nt siRNAs designed to knock down gene expression.
The sequences for the mouse HMGB1 siRNAs are as follows;
Sequence1: 5′-GGAGAGAUGUGGAACAACA-3′ Sequence2: 5′-
CCAUUGUGGUAGGGUAACA-3′ Sequence3: 5′-GUACCUUCU
AAUCCUUACA-3′. siRNAs for i.c.v. injection were prepared
according to the in vivo siRNA transfection protocol for brain
delivery from PolyPlus Transfection. Four lL of the siRNA
complexes were i.c.v. injected at a flow rate of 1 lL/min to mice
under anesthesia.
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse brains were taken after perfusion with PBS (pH 7.4) at day 5
after LPC injection and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Coronal
sections of 20-lm thickness were cut on cryostat at 20°C and
collected on glass slides. Sections were fixed with cold acetone for
5 min, and rinsed three times in PBS (pH 7.4). After blocking with
3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), sections were then incubated at
4°C overnight in a PBS solution containing the primary antibodies
in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3% BSA. Staining was performed for
reactive astrocytes (GFAP) and HMGB1. The sections were washed
and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies with fluorescence
conjugations. Subsequently, the slides were covered with VECTASHIELD
mounting medium with 4′, 6 ′-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (H-1200 from Vector Laboratories, INC., Burlingame, CA,
USA).
Western blotting
Tissue samples of corpus callosum were prepared using Pro-
PREPTM Protein Extraction Solution (BOCA SCIENTIFIC Inc.,
Boca Raton, FL, USA). Samples were heated with equal volumes of
sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Novex, Grand Island, NY,
USA) and 10 mM dithiothreitol at 95°C for 5 min, and then each
sample (20 lg per lane) was loaded onto 4–20% Tris-glycine gels.
After electrophoresis and transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Novex), the membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.2% I-block (Tropix,
Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA, USA) for 90 min at 20 to 25°C.
Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal
anti-HMGB1 antibody (1 : 1000) followed by incubation with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualization by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham GE Healthcare Biosciences
, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
FACS analysis
White matter tissues were minced and then digested at 37°C for
30 min with an enzyme cocktail (Collagenase type IV, DNase I,
Sigma Aldrich). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by filtering
through a 40-lm strainer. After that, cell suspensions were preblocked
with 3% BSA and then incubated with the following
primary antibodies against CD34 (1 : 100, GenWay), VEGFR2/
Flk1/KDR (1 : 100, Abcam), BDNF (1 : 100, Abcam), Fibroblast
growth factor 2 (1 : 100, Santacruz), and RAGE (1 : 100, Abcam).

laboratories (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West
Grove, PA, USA) were incubated for 30 min at 20 to 25°C. Labeled
cell populations were measured using FACS-Calibur (BD biosciences
). FACS data were then analyzed using Cellquest pro
software (BD biosciences). FACS analysis was performed using a
variety of controls including unstained samples, isotype antibodies,
and single stained samples for determining appropriate gates,
voltages, and compensations required in multivariate flow cytometry.
Cell cultures
The rat brain microendothelial cell line RBE.4 was maintained in
EBM-2-containing EGM-2MV SingleQuots kit in collagen-coated
25-cm2 flasks at a density of 29 105 cells/cm2 incubated in a 5%
CO
2
incubator at 37°C (Arai and Lo 2009a). Rat endothelial
progenitor cells (EPCs) were prepared from rat spleens (Rosell
et al. 2009). For each independent experiment, spleens from 11- to
12-week-old Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were kept in PBS solution.
Under the hood, spleens were mechanically minced, placed at 37°C
for 15 min, and run through a 40-lm nylon membrane to obtain
cell suspension. After that, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were
obtained by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque
Plus (Amersham Biosciences Corp). Isolated MNCs were shortly
washed with red blood cells lysis solution and gently washed twice
with complete growth media EGM-2MV (Lonza, Hopkinton, MA,
USA). MNCs were finally resuspended in EGM-2MV and 39 107
MNCs per well were seeded on collagen I-coated six-well plates
(Becton Dickinson Labware BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and
incubated in a 5% CO
2
incubator at 37°C. Under daily observation,
first media change was performed 3–4 days after plating. Early
EPCs (5–7days after seeding) were used for the migration assay,
and late EPCs (1–1.5 months after seeding) were for the tubeformation
assay.
In vitro transendothelial migration assay
Rat brain endothelial cells (RBE.4) (19 105 cells/well) were plated
on polycarbonate membrane (3-lm pore filters, Corning Costar,
Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) coated with collagen I to
obtain confluent endothelial monolayer. Ac low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-labeled EPCs (19 105 cells/well) were placed in the upper
chamber on top of the RBE.4 monolayer. The chambers were placed
in a 24-well culture plate containing HMGB1 (100 ng/mL). After
24 h of incubation at 37°C, labeled EPCs migrating into the lower
chamber were counted in four random microscopic fields.
EPCs labeling
Cells were incubated with 5 ug/mL of 1,19-dioctadecyl-3,3,39,39-
tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI)-labeled acetylated low-density
lipoprotein (ac-LDL; Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY, USA) at
37°C for 120 min in EGM-2MV.
In vitro tube-formation assay
The standard Matrigel assay was used to assess the spontaneous
formation of capillary-like structures of the late EPCs. Standard
24-well plates were coated with 150 uL of cold Matrigel and
allowed to solidify at 37°C for 30 min. Cells (59 104 cells/well)
were seeded in those plates and incubated at 37°C for 18 h.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed by using ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s honestly significant difference tests. Data are expressed as
mean SEM. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
As expected, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) injections into
the corpus callosum induced focal demyelination at 5 days
(Fig. 1a). HMGB1 expression was increased in the damaged
white matter region (Fig. 1b), with the majority of signals
colocalizing with GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes
(Fig. 1c). Flow cytometry demonstrated an accumulation of
Flk1/CD34-double positive EPCs in these areas (Fig. 2a–b).
Further analysis showed that expression levels of brainderived
neurotrophic factor and basicfibroblast growth factor
were elevated in these EPCs within the damaged white
matter regions (Fig. 2c).

(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1814500801)
A key receptor for HMGB1 is the RAGE. Flow cytometry
confirmed that EPCs in damaged white matter were positive
for RAGE (Fig. 3a). These findings therefore suggest that
HMGB1 released from reactive astrocytes can bind to RAGE
receptors present on EPCs. To assess the functional significance
of this cell–cell signaling, mice were treated with
vehicle or RAGE-neutralizing antibody. Blockade of RAGE
significantly reduced the accumulation of EPCs in LPC-
damaged white matter (Fig. 3b).
Next, we tested the ability of siRNA to interfere with
HMGB1-mediated EPC responses in white matter. Western
blot analysis confirmed that in vivo HMGB1 siRNA
successfully down-regulated HMGB1 expression in the
focal LPC-induced white matter lesions (Fig. 4a), without
affecting the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes that were
present (Fig. 4b). Suppression of HMGB1 with siRNA led
to a significant reduction in EPC accumulation (Fig. 4c–d).
Concomitantly, this reduction in EPC numbers occurred
together with a decrease in microvascular response.
Immunostaining with anti-CD31 (endothelial cell marker)
and anti-Ki67 (proliferative cell marker) antibodies revealed
that HMGB1 siRNA decreased the number of newly
emerged endothelial cells within the white matter lesion
area (Fig. 5a–b).
Finally, cell culture experiments were conducted to
directly test the effects of HMGB1 in EPCs. In a transwell
assay, HMGB1 significantly increased the migration of
labeled EPCs (Fig. 6a–b). In a matrigel assay, HMGB1
significantly increased the rates of tube formation and this
pro-angiogenic effect was blocked with RAGE-neutralizing
antibody (Fig. 7a–b).

The neurovascular unit describes a conceptual framework for
cell–cell interactions in gray matter (Lo et al. 2003, 2004;

oligovascular niche supports signaling between oligodendrocytes
and cerebral endothelium to promote oligodendrogenesis
and angiogenesis in white matter (Arai and Lo 2009a;
Hayakawa et al. 2012b; Pham et al. 2012). But, beyond cell
–cell interactions within the brain, interactions between brain
and circulating blood cells are now known to be critically
important as well (Meisel et al. 2005; Offner et al. 2006,
2009; Titova et al. 2008; Ma et al. 2010). In humans,
circulating levels of EPCs tend to track the temporal profile
of recovery from 7 to 14 days after stroke onset (Navarro-
Sobrino et al. 2010, 2011). In animal studies, peripheral
administration of CD34+ cells enhanced endogenous neurogenesis
via angiogenesis after stroke (Taguchi et al. 2004).
EPCs can promote the migration of endothelial cells by
releasing soluble factors such as VEGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1
(Urbich et al. 2005), and EPC transplantation improved
long-term stroke outcomes (Fan et al. 2010). Nevertheless,
the role of EPCs has been primarily described for gray matter.
This study provides proof-of-concept that reactive astrocytes
can produce HMGB1 that promotes EPCs in a mouse model
of LPC-induced white matter injury. These findings may
provide the basis for further investigating the cross-talk
that exists between central white matter and peripheral
responses after stroke, brain injury, and neurodegeneration.
Our current study may have two important implications.
First, although white matter damage is a key part of all
neurological disorders, white matter mechanisms are relatively
understudied compared with gray matter mechanisms.
Our data here suggest that astrocytes may signal to EPCs
after white matter injury. Indeed, low levels of circulating
EPCs are associated with increased risk of age-related white
matter changes in stroke and cognitive impairment (Fu et al.
2005; Verdelho et al. 2007; Jickling et al. 2009). Therefore,
dissecting the mechanisms for interactions between white
matter and circulating blood cells may lead us to novel
approaches for treating white matter dysfunction in CNS
disorders. A second implication is that reactive astrocytes
here show beneficial actions by promoting EPC function.
The reactive astrocyte is a seminal feature of damaged or
diseased brain. Traditionally, reactive astrocytic scars were
thought to be detrimental because they can secrete several
inhibitory substrates that retard axonal and dendritic plasticity
(Silver and Miller 2004). However, a more nuanced view
of the reactive astrocyte has been recently proposed. Reactive
astrocytes can also release many trophic factors (Tower and
Young 1973; Strauss et al. 1994; Silver and Miller 2004).
These trophic factors may be beneficial in the chronic phase
after brain injury by promoting neuronal survival and
augmenting coordinated responses in synaptogenesis, neurogenesis
, and angiogenesis (Mocchetti and Wrathall 1995;
Tokita et al. 2001). Our findings here suggest that, along
with growth factors, HMGB1 may also be positive factor by
allowing reactive astrocytes to signal to pro-recovery EPCs
in white matter.

protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. (b) Immunostaining
analysis also showed that HMGB1 siRNA successfully decreased
HMGB1 expressed by reactive astrocytes on day 5, without affecting
the levels of GFAP-positive cells. (c–d) Flow cytometry showed that
treatment with HMGB1 siRNA reduced the EPC accumulation in
ipsilateral corpus callosum on day 5. n = 5. *p < 0.05.

Astrocytic HMGB1 and white matter remodeling 277
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
Taken together, our current findings suggest that HMGB1
mediates the cross-talk between reactive astrocytes and
circulating EPCs after white matter injury. Nevertheless,
there are a few caveats that need to be considered for future
studies. First, we only focused on the beneficial role of
HMGB1. But, HMGB1 has been well known as a deleterious
factor after injury (Andersson et al. 2000; Park et al. 2003;
Dai et al. 2010). How the recovering brains balance the
deleterious versus beneficial actions of HMGB1 should be
carefully dissected. Second, there are other receptors for
HMGB1 such as the toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4
(Lotze and Tracey 2005). TLR2 and TLR4 are both expressed
in brain cells (Caso et al. 2007; Hua et al. 2007; Tang et al.
2007), and they have been shown to play a critical role in
infectious diseases (Laflamme et al. 2003; Mishra et al.
2006; Tanget al.2007). Therefore, examining roles of TLR2
and TLR4 in brain remodeling would be a promising direction
to understand the brain pathophysiology. Third, other cells
besides EPCs may also be affected by HMGB1 released from
astrocytes. Further studies are warranted to examine these
multicellular effects including those that should occur in
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Woodruff et al. 2004).

literature, non-specific chemical toxicity is a serious caveat.
Exploring these HMGB1 mechanisms in other models of
white matter injury such as endothelin-1-injection (Sozmen
et al. 2009) or chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Shibata et al.
2004) will be useful. Fifth, we use siRNA and RAGE-
blocking antibodies for proof-of-concept. Future studies
using more potent RAGE inhibitors (Carnevale et al. 2012;
Deane et al. 2012) will be required for translational relevance.
Finally, the precise mechanisms for how the accumulated
EPCs can contribute to white matter remodeling remain
to be fully assessed. Do the accumulated EPCs directly
promote vascular remodeling by differentiating into mature
endothelial cells? Or do they modulate the local environment
for remodeling by secreting trophic factors? Our current data
show that accumulated EPCs produce BDNF and FGF-2,
which are well known as pro-survival factors. But, besides
those two growth factors, many other trophic factors such as
VEGF should also play important roles for remodeling the
neurovascular unit (Manoonkitiwongsa 2011). In white
matter, trophic coupling between oligodendrocytes and
cerebral endothelial cells in the oligovascular niche supports
ongoing oligodendrogenesis and angiogenesis (Arai and Lo
2009b). Therefore, dissecting the roles of EPC-derived
trophic factors may contribute to another aspect of the
oligovascular niche in white matter remodeling after injury.
Pathophysiologic responses after brain injury are highly
complex. Beyond cell–cell interactions within the brain,
factors outside the brain may also affect brain homeostasis.
Our current study demonstrates that reactive astrocytes
secrete HMGB1 that may attract circulating EPCs to
damaged tissue in white matter injury. These findings
provide proof-of-concept for a novel mechanism of dynamic
cross-talk between white matter and circulating blood cells.
Understanding the precise mechanisms of communication
between reactive astrocytes and EPCs will ultimately lead us
to new therapeutic strategies for white matter-related diseases
including stroke and vascular dementia.
