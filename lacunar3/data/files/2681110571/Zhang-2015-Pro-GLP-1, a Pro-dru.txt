Pro-Glucagon-like peptide-1 (Pro-GLP-1), a long-lasting GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, was developed
using a polymeric pro-drug strategy and its neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke were investigated
in C57BL/6 mice. Pro-GLP-1 was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice once a day for
7 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. The neurological deficit score and TTC
staining were determined 24 h after ischemia. The results demonstrated that Pro-GLP-1 was slowly
degraded in the plasma and brain of the mice, and GLP-1 could be detected even 12 h after administration.
Pro-GLP-1 was significantly neuroprotective in C57BL/6 mice subjected to MCAO. In cultured cortical
neurons, treatment with Pro-GLP-1 attenuated apoptosis induced by oxygen–glucose deprivation
(OGD). The neuroprotective effects of Pro-GLP-1 were blocked by a selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist
and knockdown of GLP-1 receptor with shRNA. However, Pro-GLP-1 had no effect on blood glucose
and insulin levels which indicated that neuroprotection was mediated by the activation of GLP-1 receptor
in the brain. Pro-GLP-1 repaired the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and decreased the
expression of caspase-3. The anti-apoptotic effect was mediated by the cAMP/PKA and PI3 K/Akt pathway.
Our research provides evidence that pre-treatment of MCAO mice with Pro-GLP-1 exerts a neuroprotective
effect mediated by a blockade of apoptosis and that Pro-GLP-1 might be a potential
neuroprotective agent candidate against ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a serious disease leading to death and disability
as well as malignant tumors and heart disease which is induced
by a reduction or even blockade of blood flow to the cerebrovascular
system (Go et al., 2014). This pathological process is accompanied
with a series of events including glutamate excitotoxicity,
oxidative stress, nitric oxide production, calcium overload and
inflammation (Tu et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2014). Multiple neuroprotective
compounds have been reported to be effective against cerebral
ischemia in animal and cell models (Gu et al., 2012; Mathai
et al., 2012), but few of these drugs are clinically effective (Cook
et al., 2012). Thrombolysis with intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA) is the only approved therapy of patients with acute
ischemic stroke, but the narrow therapeutic window and side
effects of t-PA have limited its clinical application (Yepes et al.,
2009). Thus, new strategies and agents are urgent required for
the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an important gastrointestinal
hormone which plays a crucial role in blood glucose control
and pancreatic islet b cell proliferation (Sathananthan et al.,
2013; Aulinger et al., 2014). GLP-1 is also a neuropeptide synthesized
by neuronal cells, and GLP-1 receptor is widely expressed
throughout the brain (Darsalia et al., 2013). GLP-1 receptor activation
exerts a neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia (Li et al.,
2009), modulates neuronal activity, protects against neuronal
damage induced by various insults, and is involved in learning
and memory (Greig et al., 2014; Seufert and Gallwitz, 2014). Therefore
, GLP-1 receptors may serve as an effective therapeutic target
for brain disorders. However, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded and inactivated
shortly after secretion into the blood, which has limited its
clinical use (Idorn et al., 2014). Thus, it is necessary to develop
long-lasting GLP-1 analogues without the short-comings of native
GLP-1, for possible clinical application (Doyle et al., 2003). GLP-1
binds the GLP-1 receptor via its NH2-terminal ectodomains (ECDs)
(Castro et al., 2005; Hoare, 2005; Laburthe et al., 2007) and develhttp

opment of small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists has been generally
unsuccessful. Some agonists have been reported but they have
low efficiency compared with GLP-1 (Sloop et al., 2010). Long-lasting
peptide analogues such as liraglutide and exenatide were identified
and investigated, and the neuroprotective efficiency of these
analogs was also reported (Lee et al., 2011; Teramoto et al., 2011;
Briyal et al., 2012; Darsalia et al., 2012; Darsalia et al., 2013; Sato
et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Holscher, 2014). However, these analogs
have the potential to exert immunogenicity because their
structure is different from native GLP-1 (Davies et al., 2011). Thus,
new strategies should be applied in the development and identification
of new long-lasting GLP-1 receptor agonists.
Using a polymeric pro-drug strategy, we have developed a new
polymer of GLP-1 named Pro-GLP-1. The polymer was produced in
Escherichia coli as a single polypeptide chain containing GLP-1
repeats. Pro-GLP-1 can be slowly digested by specific endoproteinase in vivo in which case bioactive GLP-1 is gradually released.
Therefore, the bioavailability and bioactivity of GLP-1 is extended
in vivo. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of
Pro-GLP-1 on cerebral infarction after the induction of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in C57BL/6 mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Release of GLP-1 from Pro-GLP-1
To demonstrate the in vivo release rate of GLP-1 from Pro-GLP-
1, 1 nmol/kg of Pro-GLP-1 or 3 nmol/kg of GLP-1 was intraperitoneally
injected into C57BL/6 mice. Blood samples and brain tissue
from CA1 region of hippocampus were collected at different time
points. The plasma samples were centrifugated at 2500 rpm for
5 min at 4C. Brain tissues were homogenized in PBS and centrifuged
at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4C. The supernatants were used
for further determination. The concentration of GLP-1 in the
plasma and brain was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) using a GLP-1 ELISA kit (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA).
Pro-GLP-1 at a final concentration of 100lM was incubated
with 20ll of human plasma at 37C for 12 h. The reaction mixture
(50ll) was sampled at the indicated time points. Sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS) loading buffer was added to the samples to terminate
the enzymatic reaction. Western blot analysis was performed
to determine the level of GLP-1 at different time points.
2.2. Detection of exendin-4 Level in the brain and plasma
Determination of exendin-4 levels in the brain and plasma are
described as follows. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with
1 nmol/kg exendin-4. Brain tissue and plasma samples were collected
at different time points after administration. Exendin-4 levels
in the brain and plasma were determined by EIA kit (Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, USA). Plates were read at a wavelength
of 450 nm on a SpectraMax 190 enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay plate reader.
2.3. Determination of blood glucose and plasma Insulin levels
Pro-GLP-1 (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 nmol/kg) or saline were intraperitoneally
injected into C57BL/6 mice, and blood glucose and plasma
insulin levels were measured 0 and 30 min after administration.
The blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated time
using a glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Plasma insulin levels were determined by ELISA kit (Millipore).
The optical density was monitored at a wavelength of 490 nm.
Detection values were converted using a standard curve performed
in parallel.
2.4. Experimental animals
Male C57BL/6 mice weighting between 18 and 22 g were used
in our study. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Fourth Military Medical University
and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals
used and minimize their discomfort. Mice were randomly divided
into 5 groups (8 animals per group). Group 1, Sham group (Saline),
Group 2, MCAO + Vehicle (Saline), Group 3, MCAO + 0.3 nmol/kg
Pro-GLP-1, Group 4, MCAO + 1 nmol/kg Pro-GLP-1, Group 5,
MCAO + 3 nmol/kg Pro-GLP-1. Saline or Pro-GLP-1 was administered
by intraperitoneal injection once-a-day for 7 consecutive
days. Mice were subjected to MCAO surgery after the last administration
of Pro-GLP-1. Neurological deficits, volume of the infarcted
lesions and nissl staining were measured 24 h after ischemia.
2.5. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) Model
The MCAO model was performed according to a previously published
protocol (de la Rosa et al., 2014). Briefly, mice were anesthetized
with 1% pentobarbital sodium. The external carotid artery
(ECA) and the right common carotid artery (CCA) were isolated.
The incision near the ECA–CCA branch was inserted into a nylon filament
coated with silicon resin and advanced about 9–11 mm.
Reperfusion was performed 90 min after MCAO. The procedure
performed in the sham group was the same as the model group
but the nylon filament was advanced only about 5 mm. The body
temperature of each animal was held at 37C during surgery until
recovery from anesthesia after surgery.
2.6. Evaluation of neurological deficits
Neurological deficit scores were analyzed according to Bederson
’s score (Dong et al., 2013), and was defined as follows: Grade
0, no deficit observed; Grade 1, flexion to contralateral torso and
forelimb; Grade 2, decreased resistance to lateral push but without
circling; Grade 3, leaning to affected side; and Grade 4, no spontaneous
locomotor activity. Higher neurological deficit scores indicated
more severe impairment of motor injury.
2.7. 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
After the evaluation of neurological deficit scores, mice were
killed and their brains were removed at 4C, then frozen at
20C for 1 h. TTC staining was performed to analyze the infarct
volume. Brain tissue was sliced into 1 mm sections, the slices were
incubated in 1.5% TTC solution for 30 min at 37C, and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature. The tissue slices
were digitally scanned and the volume of the infarction was analyzed
using photo shop CS4 software.
2.8. Nissl staining
Mice were killed and their brains were perfused with saline followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde. The prefrontal cortex and dorsal
hippocampal area section were selected for nissl staining. Briefly,
each brain section (20lM) was cut using a frozen slicer (Leica
Microsystems) and incubated in chloroform and acetone for
15 min, then switched to alcohol at a gradient concentration of
100%, 95% and 70% for 1 min. The slices were washed 3 times
and incubated with 1% cresyl violet (containing 0.25% glacial acetic
acid) for 20 min.

2.9. Intracerebroventricular Infusion of small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
Expression of GLP-1 receptor in the CA1 region of hippocampus
was knocked down by intracerebroventricularly injecting shRNA.
The specific sequence of shRNA targeting to GLP-1R (GenBank
Accession No. NM_021332.2, nucleotides 608–628) mRNA
sequence were constructed into the pGV118 lentiviral vector
(GeneChem Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). High purity (>1.9 ratio
260/280 Abs) transfection ready vector DNA was prepared and
resuspended in TE (pH 8.0). The shRNA target sequence was
GCCCTCAAGTGGATGTATAGC (5’–3’ with the titre of 108TU/ml). A
scrambled shRNA sequence TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT (50–30 with
the titre of 108TU/ml) was chosen for negative control. The lentiviral
was dissolved in Enhanced Infection Solution (GeneChem Co,
Ltd.) and administrated intracerebroventricularly by the volume
of 1ll per mouse. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital
sodium, and then placed in a mouse stereotaxic instrument.
Negative control or lentivirus containing shRNA
complimentary to GLP-1 receptor was stereotaxically injected into
the right lateral ventricle (bregma: 0.58 mm; dorsoventral:
2.1 mm; lateral: 1.2 mm) of each mouse. After injection, the needle
stayed in the brain for 5 min and was withdrawn at the rate of
1 mm/min. Mice were returned to their cages after they recovered
from the anesthesia.
2.10. Primary mouse cortical neuronal culture and oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD)
Primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic
18 day-old C57BL/6 mice. After the brain was removed from the
embryo, the prefrontal cortex was carefully dissected, minced,
and trypsinized using 0.125% trypsin. Neurons were seeded into
96 or 6 well plates with DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum,
the density of the neuron was about 2500 cells/mm2. Twenty four
hours later, the culture medium was replaced with neurobasal
medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 2% B27 (Invitrogen
) and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). These cultures were
maintained in 95% air 5% CO
2
with 95% humidity at 37C. Neurons
were used for further analysis 7 days after culture. OGD was performed
as previously reported (Meloni et al., 2001), briefly, neurons
were washed three times with PBS, placed in glucose-free
EBSS buffer and incubated for 6 h in an anoxic chamber which
was filled with 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
at 37C. The neurons were then
returned to normoxic conditions for reoxygenation and the culture
medium was replaced by fresh neuron-basal media for 12 h.
2.11. cAMP accumulation assay
Neurons cultured for 7 days were incubated with GLP-1, exendin-4
or Pro-GLP-1 at different concentrations for 30 min at
37C, then digested with trypsin and centrifuged at 800 rpm for
10 min at 4C. The supernatant was discarded, the neurons were
resuspended in cell lysis buffer, and the cells were thawed by gentle
mixing. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and
the supernatants were lyophilized. cAMP was measured using the
cAMP parameter assay kit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All values
were converted to concentration of cAMP using a cAMP standard
curve performed in parallel, and data were subsequently normalized
to the response of 1 mm GLP-1. Triplicate plates were analyzed
for each data point.
2.12. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay
Cell viability was measured by the MTT and LDH assay. Cells
were seeded into 96-well plates with 100ll neurobasal medium
per well. After the preprocessing, the cells were treated with
different concentrations of Pro-GLP-1 (0, 2.5, 10, and 40 nm) 1 h
before OGD. After OGD and reperfusion for 12 h, MTT (0.5 mg/ml)
was added to each well and then incubated at 37C for 4 h. The
culture medium was replaced with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate
reader. Cell injury was assessed by measuring the LDH released
using a cytotoxicity detection kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (JianCheng Co, Nanjing, China). The absorbance was
measured at 490 nm. The total LDH release was determined in
the neurons treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 24 h. Cells maintained
under normoxic conditions were defined as 100% viable,
and the viability of cells exposed to OGD conditions is expressed
as a percentage compared to neurons under normoxic conditions.
Triplicate plates were analyzed for each data point.
2.13. Hoechst/propidium iodide (PI) double staining
Twenty-four hours after OGD/R conditions, neurons were
stained with 10lg/ml Hoechst 33,258 (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO,
USA) and 10lg/ml PI (Sigma). After staining for 15 min, the cells
were fixed with formaldehyde for 20 min and observed under a
fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61, Japan). The Hoechst
and PI were excited at 340 nm and 620 nm respectively. Three
visual fields were randomly selected in each sample.
2.14. Cell treatment pradigm
Pro-GLP-1 was dissolved in ddH
2
O and added to medium at a
final concentration of 10 nm 1 h before OGD. PKA, PI3 K and MEK
inhibitors were purchased from selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX,
USA). H89 (10lM, Selleck, no. S1582), wortmanin (10lM, Selleck,
no. S2758) and U0126 (10lM, Selleck, no. S1102) were added to
the cultures 2 h before OGD injury and remained in the culture
throughout Pro-GLP-1 treatment. Neurons in the OGD group were
treated with an equal volume of ddH
2
O, while the normoxia group
did not receive any treatment.
2.15. Western blot
Protein sample (10lg) was loaded and subjected to SDS–PAGE
at 200 V for 45 min and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes at 100 V for 120 min. The membranes were incubated
with anti-pAKT antibody (1:1000; CST, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-p-
CREB (1:1000; CST), anti-Bax (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, Texas, USA), anti-BCL-2 (1:500; Santa), anti-Caspase-3
(1:500; Santa Cruz) and anti-b-actin (1:5000; Sigma, Saint Louis,
MO, USA) at 4C overnight. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (Santa Cruz) was diluted 1:10,000 and the membranes
were incubated with this antibody concentration for 1 h.
Then the bands on the film were scanned and analyzed.
2.16. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as means ± SEM. SPSS13.0 was used to
perform statistical analysis. The differences between groups were
analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett T-test. A
p< 0.05 was considered to be significant.
3. Results
3.1. Pro-GLP-1 continuously released GLP-1
The schematic diagram of Pro-GLP-1 was shown in Fig. 1A. To
determine the release of GLP-1 from Pro-GLP-1 in vitro, Pro-GLP-
1 was incubated with human plasma. Western blot analysis was
84 H. Zhang et al. /European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 70 (2015) 82–91
(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
used to determinate the amount of GLP-1 released over time. After
incubation for 15 min, soluble GLP-1 was detectable in the plasma,
and this amount progressively increased during the 12 h of incubation
(Fig. 1B). These results indicated that GLP-1 was continuously
released from Pro-GLP-1 for at least 12 h.
To detect the release of GLP-1in vivo, a single dose of Pro-GLP-1
or GLP-1 was intraperitoneally administrated to C57BL/6 mice.
GLP-1 was metabolized rapidly in vivo which was hardly detectable
50 min after injection. However, compared with the short
half-life of GLP-1, Pro-GLP-1 was slowly degraded in the plasma,
and GLP-1 could be detected even 12 h after administration
(Fig. 2A). We next determined the amount of GLP-1 in the brain following
GLP-1 or Pro-GLP-1 injection. Native GLP-1 was barely
detectable in the brain after injection because it was quickly
metabolized in the plasma. However, in the mice that had been
injected with Pro-GLP-1, GLP-1 was detected in the brain 12 min
after intraperitoneal administration, and this amount gradually
increased over time. GLP-1 was still detected 12 h after administration
of Pro-GLP-1 (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that Pro-GLP-1
was gradually degraded in the tissues after administration and this
process continuously released GLP-1.
3.2. Pro-GLP-1 activated GLP-1 receptor signaling with high efficacy
GLP-1 ligation of the GLP-1 receptor activates changes in cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration (Van de Velde
et al., 2011). Therefore, GLP-1 receptor signaling induced by Pro-
GLP-1 was evaluated by detecting changes in cAMP concentration
in primary cultured neurons. Pro-GLP-1 had an EC
50
of 2.3 nm with
100% potency relative to maximum stimulation by GLP-1 in primary
cultured neurons, while exendin-4 had an EC
50
of 0.15lM
and only 82% potency compared with maximum stimulation by
GLP-1 (Fig. 3A). Treatment with exendin (9–39), a GLP-1 receptor
antagonist, blunted the GLP-1 receptor signaling activated by
Pro-GLP-1 (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that Pro-GLP-1 stimulated
the GLP-1 pathway with high efficacy and low EC
50
.
3.3. Pro-GLP-1 preconditioning improved functional outcome and
reduced infarction size caused by MCAO
The neuroprotective effect of Pro-GLP-1 was evaluated in MCAO
mice. The MCAO injury lead to a higher deficit score in mice at 24 h

after reperfusion compared with the sham group (Fig. 4A). However
, mice pre-treated with all three dose of Pro-GLP-1 demonstrated
a significant decrease in neurological deficit scores in a
dose-dependent manner compared with the vehicle group. The
TTC staining results indicated that MCAO injury produced an
infarction area that spanned the right frontal, parietal, and occipital
cerebral cortices. The infarct volume was significantly reduced in
the Pro-GLP-1 preconditioned group in a dose-dependent manner
compared with the control groups (Fig. 4B and C).
3.4. Pro-GLP-1 preconditioning increased neurons survival against
OGD
The cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury can be mimicked
in vitro by OGD and reperfusion condition. To evaluate the effect
of Pro-GLP-1 on OGD, neuronal cell viability was determined using
the MTT and LDH assays. These analyses showed that neuronal survival
was decreased after exposure to OGD. However, when the
neurons were pretreated with Pro-GLP-1, cell survival was significantly
increased compared with the OGD group and this neuroprotective
effect was abrogated by GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin
(9–39) (Fig. 5A and B).
To further evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Pro-GLP-1, the
rate of apoptosis was further evaluated using Hoechst 33,258 and
PI double staining. The results showed that OGD caused a significantly
higher rate of cell apoptosis compared with the normoxia
group. All three concentrations of Pro-GLP-1 decreased the percentage
of dead cells caused by OGD. However, this trend was
diminished by the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin (9–39)
(Fig. 5C and D).
3.5. The neuroprotective effect of Pro-GLP-1 was dependent upon
activation of GLP-1 receptor
To further determine whether the neuroprotective effect of Pro-
GLP-1 was dependent on the expression of the GLP-1 receptor, the
shRNA lentiviral vectors were used to suppress GLP-1 receptor
expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The shRNA lentiviral
constructs were applied to the brain region of each C57BL/6
mouse by stereotaxis injection, and parallel experiments were
applied using a negative control shRNA. Seven days after stereotaxis
injection of the shRNA, there was no significant difference
in GLP-1 receptor gene or protein expression between the mice
in the control (untreated with shRNA) group and the mice that
had been injected with negative shRNA. However, GLP-1 receptor
expression was significantly reduced to 30% in the CA1 region
7 days after the unilateral administration of the shRNA vector targeting
GLP-1 receptor. This inhibition lasted for at least 21 days
after the injection, both at the gene and protein level (Fig. 6A–C).
Neurological deficit evaluation and TTC staining results showed
that, the negative shRNA had no effect on the protective effect of
Pro-GLP-1, but GLP-1 receptor shRNA almost completely blocked
the beneficial effect of Pro-GLP-1 administration (Fig. 6D–F).
3.6. Pro-GLP-1 mediated anti-apoptotic effect against MCAO injury
Apoptosis is one of the major causes of neuronal death after
cerebral ischemia (Zhao et al., 2014). Bcl-2 and Bax represent the
anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl family and
the ratio between Bax and Bcl-2 can be an indicator of susceptibility
to cerebral ischemia injury (Hasegawa et al., 2010). The Bax and
Bcl-2 level in peri-infarct tissue was detected with western blot
analysis. This analysis showed that the ratio between Bax and
Bcl-2 was significantly increased 4 times 24 h after cerebral ischemia.
This ratio increased because Bax was upregulated and Bcl-2
was down-regulated. This trend was significantly reversed by
Pro-GLP-1 preconditioning, while the administration of GLP-1
receptor shRNA diminished this effect (Fig. 7A). The level of active
caspase-3 is an indicator of apoptosis (Liang et al., 2014). Western
blot analysis showed that MCAO lead to a significant increase in
active caspase-3 in the brain compared with the control group,
while Pro-GLP-1 preconditioning reversed this trend and GLP-1
receptor shRNA administration diminished this trend (Fig. 7B).
Nissl staining results showed that cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
injury led to neuronal damage, both in the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus CA1 region. The injured neurons presented as
shrunken cell bodies accompanied by shrunken and pyknotic
nuclei. Pro-GLP-1 preconditioning significantly decreased the
number of injured neurons following MCAO injury. This effect
was blocked by GLP-1 receptor shRNA administration (Fig. 7C–E).
These results showed that Pro-GLP-1 mediated a neuroprotective
effect against MCAO by inhibiting apoptosis.

3.7. The anti-apoptotic effect of Pro-GLP-1 was mediated by the cAMP/
PKA and PI3K/Akt pathway
The downstream activation of GLP-1 receptor leads to the activation
of signaling pathways such as cAMP/PKA and PI3 K/Akt
which play an important role in the process of growth, apoptosis
and proliferation of neurons (Hui et al., 2003). The stimulation of
these signaling pathways is dependent upon cell type, environmental
conditions and cellular stimuli (Wang et al., 2012).

and this beneficial effect was blocked by wortmanin (an inhibitor
of PI3 K) and H89 (an inhibitor of PKA). However, the ERK inhibitor,
U0126, had no impact on the effect of Pro-GLP-1 (Fig. 8A and B).
Western blot analysis indicated that the protein level of Bax and
active caspase-3 was upregulated while Bcl-2 was down regulated,
and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was increased after OGD compared with
the normoxia group. This observation is in accordance with the
in vivo data. Pro-GLP-1 reversed this trend since the neuroprotective
effect of Pro-GLP-1 was blocked by the PI3 K inhibitor wortmannin
and the PKA inhibitor H89 but not by the ERK inhibitor
U0126 (Fig. 8C and D). These results indicated that Pro-GLP-1
conferred a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia via
the cAMP/PKA and PI3 K/Akt pathway but this effect was independent
of the ERK pathway.
4. Discussion
Since the GLP-1 receptor is expressed in the brain, it is reasonable
to assume that GLP-1 may be neuroprotective in neurological
diseases. Perry et al. reported that GLP-1 had a beneficial effect in
excitotoxic neuronal damage (Perry et al., 2002) and the protective
effect of GLP-1 in cerebral ischemia has also been reported

(Teramoto et al., 2011; Briyal et al., 2012). However, the short halflife
of GLP-1 has limited its clinical application. Thus, long-lasting
GLP-1 analogs have been investigated for their neuroprotective
activity in these neurological pathologies.
GLP-1 receptor is a member of the 7 transmembrane G-protein
coupled receptor family. GLP-1 binds GLP-1 receptors via a twostep
mechanism (Castro et al., 2005; Hoare, 2005; Laburthe et al.,
2007). The initial binding step is the interaction between the
COOH-terminal amino acids of GLP-1 and the ECD of the GLP-1
receptor. The second phase of receptor activation is occurs when
the NH2-terminal of GLP-1 interacts with the transmembrane
domains of the GLP-1 receptor to induce the active conformation.
Traditional small molecules are unable to form this unique structural
architecture and therefore cannot modulate the activity of
the GLP-1 receptor. Thus, there has been significant difficulty in
identifying low molecular weight organic and non-peptide molecules
that can bind the GLP-1 receptor and few candidate molecules
have been reported. The design of long-lasting GLP-1
receptor agonists has been limited to 30–40 amino acid peptides.
Exendin-4 is the most commonly used long-lasting GLP-1 receptor
agonist and it has about 50% homology to native GLP-1. However,
the altered structure of exendin-4 reduces its affinity for the GLP-1
receptor and our data has shown that the EC
50
of exendin-4 was
almost 10-fold higher than that of native GLP-1. Pro-GLP-1 activates
the GLP-1 receptor by gradual degradation and release of soluble
GLP-1. Thus, the EC
50
of Pro-GLP-1 was comparable to that of
native GLP-1. Pro-GLP-1 continually releases GLP-1 for 12 h, while
exendin-4 reached its optimal potency after only 1 h after administration
and it was hardly detected 4 h after intraperitoneal injection
in the plasma and the brain (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our results
are in accordance with previous reports (Hadjiyanni et al., 2008;
Gao and Jusko, 2011; Li et al., 2012). Thus, Pro-GLP-1 is a pro-drug
of GLP-1 with a long half-life and low EC
50
.
Previous reports have shown that activation of the GLP-1 receptor
resulted in an improvement of glycemic control, which could
lower blood glucose and stimulate insulin release (Skoglund
et al., 2000; Holst and Gromada, 2004). Hyperglycemia is one of
the major independent risk factors for cerebral ischemia (Kamada
et al., 2007). Insulin was found to confer a neuroprotective effect
in cerebral ischemia in MCAO (Sanderson et al., 2009). The GLP-1
analog exendin-4 was reported to confer a profound neuroprotective
effect in a MCAO model of diabetic rats (Darsalia et al., 2012).
Thus, a peripheral effect on hyperglycemia induced by the GLP-1
receptor agonist is necessary to be excluded in non-diabetic mice.
Since the concentration of native GLP-1 was continually detected
in the brain of our Pro-GLP-1-treated mice, and knock-down of
the GLP-1 receptor in the hippocampus blocked the neuroprotective
effect of Pro-GLP-1, we can conclude that Pro-GLP-1 conferred
a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia in this model by activating
the GLP-1 receptor in the brain. Taken together, we
