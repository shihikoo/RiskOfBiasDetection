The tetra(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline, BTA-EG
4
, is a novel amyloid-binding small molecule that can penetrate the
blood–brain barrier and protect cells from A-induced toxicity. However, the effects of A-targeting molecules on other cellular processes
, including those that modulate synaptic plasticity, remain unknown. We report here that BTA-EG
4
decreases Alevels, alters cell
surface expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and improves memory in wild-type mice. Interestingly, the BTA-EG
4
-mediated
behavioral improvement is not correlated with LTP, but with increased spinogenesis. The higher dendritic spine density reflects an
increase in the number of functional synapses as determined by increased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency without changes in
presynaptic parameters or postsynaptic mEPSC amplitude. Additionally, BTA-EG
4
requires APP to regulate dendritic spine density
through a Ras signaling-dependent mechanism. Thus, BTA-EG
4
may provide broad therapeutic benefits for improving neuronal and
cognitive function, and may have implications in neurodegenerative disease therapy.
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized
by aggregated extracellular amyloid-(A) plaques in the
brain (Finder and Glockshuber, 2007). Extracellular A deposition
deteriorates axons, reduces dendritic spine density, and increases
oxidative stress (Subbarao et al., 1990), partially by direct
interaction between cellular enzymes and A (Lustbader et al.,
2004;Habib et al., 2010). Current therapies for AD, such as acetyl
cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists (memantine
), provide only temporary symptomatic relief without
altering the long-term progression of the disease. Other leading
strategies seek to alter long-term disease progression, but are severely
limited by their induction of widespread toxicity. While
patients receiving A immunotherapy showed an apparent reduction
in Aplaque load and slowed cognitive decline, adverse
side effects of the treatment have included vasogenic edema
(Nicoll et al., 2003; Orgogozo et al., 2003). Likewise, while
-secretase inhibitors can effectively decrease A peptide levels
and improve memory in a mouse model of AD, widespread inhibition
of Notch-mediated signaling following treatment results
in developmental defects (Loane et al., 2009). Clearly, novel strategies
must be developed in parallel both to treat the underlying
pathology of the disease and to prevent the adverse side effects of
current therapies.
One novel strategy to overcome AD pathology is the use of
small molecules to prevent aggregated A from interacting with
cellular components in harmful ways (Selkoe, 2011). Members of
the benzothiazole aniline (BTA) family of compounds are characterized
as a class of small molecules that have shown great
promise in preventing A–protein interactions. Yang et al. previously
reported that a tetra-ethylene glycol derivative of BTA
(BTA-EG
4
) inhibits A-induced cellular damage by surrounding
aggregated Awith a bioresistive coating, preventing its association
with cellular proteins (Inbar et al., 2006; Habib et al., 2010;
Capule and Yang, 2012). BTA-EG
4
is able to adhere to aggregated
forms of A with high affinity (20 nM), cross the blood–brain
barrier,andhasadequatesolubilityinaqueoussolutions(Inbaret
al., 2006). Thus, BTA-EG
4
is a promising candidate for furtherin
vivo study. While the effects of BTA compounds on AD pathogenesis
are areas of active investigation, it is also pertinent to
understand their effects on normal brain activity and synaptic
function.

In the present study, we investigated the biological effects of
BTA-EG
4
on synaptic function in vitro and in vivo. We initially
found that BTA-EG
4
-injected wild-type mice exhibited increased
dendritic spine formation, as well as improved memory. The
spinogenic activity of BTA-EG
4
is accompanied by an increase in
the number of functional synapses, as evidenced by an elevated
frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs
). Furthermore, BTA-EG
4
acts via amyloid precursor protein
(APP) to increase Ras activity as well as downstream Ras signaling
, which is necessary for its ability to increase dendritic spine
density. These data suggest that BTA-EG
4
may be beneficial as a
therapeutic treatment for the neuronal and cognitive dysfunction
seen in AD by targeting Ras-dependent spinogenesis.

in wild-type mice. The partitioning of BTA-EG
4
between plasma and
brain was studied in male CD-1 mice. The mice were dosed with 10
mg/kg, i.p., BTA-EG
4
(in 10% DMSO/90% PBS; n 2 per time point),
andtheconcentrationofBTA-EG

intheplasmaandbrainwasmeasured
over time. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture and was pooled in
EDTA tubes and centrifuged, and the plasma was isolated. The brain was
collected from each mouse, snap frozen, and homogenized in 2 ml of
PBS. The concentration of BTA-EG
4
in the plasma and brain at each time
point was determined by liquid chromatography/MS/MS, and the concentrations
of BTA-EG
4
in the plasma and brain were plotted as a function
of time. The following pharmacokinetic parameters for the plasma
and brain profile of BTA-EG
4
were also calculated: the half-life (t

) for
BTA-EG
4
in the plasma and brain, the maximum concentration (C
max
)
of BTA-EG
4
in the plasma and brain, the area under the concentration–
time curve (AUC), the brain-to-plasma ratio (BB), and the logarithmic
brain-to-plasma ratio (Log BB).
Cell lines. COS7 cells (Lombardi Co-Resources Cancer Center,
Georgetown University) were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies) in a 5% CO
2
incubator. The cells were transiently transfected with 0.5–1g of plasmid
in FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. For cotransfections,
cells were similarly transfected with 0.5–1g of each plasmid in FuGENE
6 (Roche) and cultured for 24 h in DMEM with 10% FBS.
Primary neuron culture and immunostaining. Primary hippocampal
neurons from E19 Sprague Dawley rats were cultured at 150 cells/mm2,
as previously described (Pak et al., 2001). Neurons were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate precipitation
with GFPpoly-L-lysine (PLL), GFPAPP shRNA, or GFPAPP and
treated with BTA-EG
4
. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-
GFP (9F9.F9, Novus Biologicals), rabbit anti-GFP (A11122, Invitrogen),
rabbit anti-GluR1 (PC246, Calbiochem), mouse anti-GluR2 (556341,
BD Pharmingen, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-postsynaptic density-95
(PSD-95) (NeuroMabs), mouse anti-synaptophysin (s5768, Sigma Aldrich
), rabbit APP N terminal (A8967, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Ras
(610001, BD Biosciences), anti-RasGRF1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
; 610149, BD Biosciences), anti-ERK1/2 (4695, Cell Signaling Technology
), anti-p-ERK1/2 (36880, Invitrogen), anti-CREB (D76D11, Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-p-CREB (06–519, Millipore), and mouse
anti-c-Myc (9E10, Novus Biologicals). Cultured hippocampal neuron
images were acquired by LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope
(Zeiss). Confocalz-series image stacks encompassing entire dendrite segments
were analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging).
We transfected cells with GFP to visualize dendrites and dendritic spines,
followed by immunostaining with synaptophysin or PSD-95. Using
MetaMorph software, we measured the average puncta number along
dendritic segments.
GST pull-down assay. To measure levels of active Ras, brain lysate
homogenized with Ral buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl,
0.5% NP40, 1.25 mMMgCl
2,
and 5% glycerol) from APP transgenic, APP
knock-out (KO), or wild-type mice was incubated with GST-Raf-RBD
purified protein coupled with glutathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare)
overnight at 4°C. After 24 h, pellets were washed with Ral buffer and
Western blotting was conducted with anti-Ras.
Cell surface biotinylation.COS7 cells were transiently transfected with
APP for 24 h in Opti-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and then
treated with BTA-EG
4
or control (CTRL) for 24 h. After 24 h, surface
proteins were biotin labeled, immobilized with NeutrAvidin TM Gel and
incubated 1 h with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, including 50 mM DTT, as
described previously (Minami et al., 2010). Elutes were analyzed for APP
by immunoblotting.
Live cell surface immunostaining. Immunostaining of surface APP in
hippocampal neurons was performed as described previously (Hoe et al.,
2012). Briefly, live neurons were incubated with APP antibodies (10
g/ml in conditioned medium) for 10 min, and then briefly fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (nonpermeabilizing conditions). Surface-labeled
APP was detected with Alexa Fluor-555 secondary antibodies. Cells were
then permeabilized in methanol (20°C, 90 s), and incubated with anti-
GFP antibody to identify transfected neurons.
Animals. Wild-type C57BL/6J and APP knock-out mice (B6.129S7-
APPtm1Dbo/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. CD1 mice were
obtained from Vivasource. All animal experiments were approved by the

and Johns Hopkins University. All animals were maintained according
to protocols approved by the Animal Welfare and Use Committee at
both institutions.
Golgi staining and morphological analysis of dendritic spines.To analyze
dendritic spine density and morphology in the brain, FD Rapid GolgiStain
Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) was used. Dissected mouse brains
were immersed in Solution A and B for 2 weeks in dark conditions at
room temperature and transferred into Solution C for 24 h at 4°C. Brains
were sliced using a VT1000S Vibratome (Leica) at 150 m thickness.
Dendritic images were acquired by Axioplan 2 (Zeiss) under bright-field
microscopy. Spine width, length, and linear density of cortical layers
II/III and CA1 of hippocampus were measured using Scion image software
(Scion). Images were coded and dendritic spines were counted in a
blinded manner. Spines from 0.2 to 2 m in length were included for
analysis. At least 25 apical oblique (AO) and 25 basal shaft (BS) dendrites
were measured for spine density from each animal, and these were averaged
per animal (n 5/group). All morphological analysis was performed
blind to experimental conditions.
AELISA.Mouse brains were homogenized in tissue homogenization
buffer containing 250 mMsucrose, 20 mMTris base, protease, and phosphatase
inhibitors. To measure soluble A, diethylamine (DEA) extraction
was performed. Crude 10% homogenate was mixed with an equal
volume of 0.4% DEA, sonicated, and ultracentrifuged for 1 h at
100,000 g. The supernatant was collected and neutralized with 10%
0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8. Sensitive and specific ELISAs to rodent A1–40 was
purchased from IBL Transatlantic and conducted per the manufacturer’s
protocol.

week, and then began behavior testing. We continued daily injections for
another week, for a total treatment course of 2 weeks. The Morris water
maze task included training mice to locate a submerged, hidden platform
using extramaze visuospatial cues. This system consists of a large, white
circular pool with a Plexiglas platform painted white and submerged
below the surface of the water, made opaque by the addition of white
nontoxic paint. During training, the platform was hidden 14 inches from
the side wall in one quadrant of the maze. The animals were gently placed
at random into one of the four quadrants, separated by 90°, and facing
the wall. The time required (latency) to locate the hidden platform was
recorded by a blinded observer and tracked using TOPSCAN, and was
limited to 90 s. Animals failing to find the platform within 90 s were
assisted to the platform. Animals were allowed to remain on the platform
for 15 s on the first trial and 10 s on subsequent trials. Twenty-four hours
after the final learning trial, a probe trial of 90 s was given. We recorded
the percentage of time spent in the quadrant where the platform was
previously located. As a control experiment, we tested motor impairment
or visual discriminative ability. The animals were required to locate a
clearly visible black platform (placed in a different location), raised above
the water surface, at least 12 h after the last trial.
Fear conditioning. Before initiating fear-conditioning tests, wild-type
mice were injected daily with BTA-EG
4
or vehicle for 2 weeks (n
8/group). Mice were subsequently trained by exposure to a conditioning
box (context) for 3 min before administering a tone (18 s) and footshock
(2 s), which were repeated twice at 1 min intervals. We performed the
contextual test 24 h after training by re-exposing the mice to the conditioning
context. A measurement of freezing behavior was recorded every
minute for 3 min inside of the conditioning box. The cued test was
conducted 3 h following the contextual test. Following a 3 min reexposure
to the conditioning box, a tone (18 s) was administered and
freezing behavior was measured for 1 min.
Electrophysiology. Transverse [for Schaffer collateral (SC) input studies
] or horizontal [for temporoammonic (TA) input studies] hippocampal
slices (400 m thick) were prepared from adult mice. Slices were
made using ice-cold dissection buffer (in mM: 212.7 sucrose, 2.6 KCl, 1.23

were evoked using 0.2 ms duration pulses delivered through a bipolar
glass stimulating electrode at 0.0333 Hz. A train of theta burst stimulation
(TBS) consisted of a burst of four pulses at 100 Hz repeated 10 times
at 5 Hz. For 4 TBS, four trains of TBS were given at 10 s intertrain
intervals. For whole-cell recordings, slices were transferred to a
submersion-type recording chamber mounted on a fixed stage of an
upright microscope (E600 FN, Nikon) with infrared (IR) oblique illumination.
AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated mEPSCs were pharmacologically
isolated by adding 1M tetrodotoxin, 20M bicuculline, and
100 M D ,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid to ACSF (30 1°C,
saturated with 95% O
2
and 5% CO
2
), which was continually perfused at
a rate of 2 ml/min. Target cells in CA1 were identified by the pyramidshaped
soma. These neurons were patched using a whole-cell patch pipette
(tip resistance 3–5 M), which was filled with internal solution (in
mM: 120 Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 MgCl

Recording was initiated 2–3 min after break-in, and each cell was recorded
for 10–15 min to collect enough mEPSCs for analysis. The Axon
patch-clamp amplifier 700B (Molecular Devices) was used for voltageclamp
recordings. Cells were held at70 mV, and the recorded mEPSC
data were digitized at 10 kHz with a data acquisition board (National

Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics). The MiniAnalysis program (Synaptosoft
) was used to analyze the acquired mEPSCs. The threshold for
detecting mEPSCs was set at three times the root mean square (RMS)
noise. There was no significant difference in the RMS noise across the
groups [BTA-EG

(n 8); t test, p 0.65]. Recordings were excluded from analysis if the
RMS noise was2, the series resistance was25 M, and input resistance
was100 M. To minimize the impact of dendritic filtering, we
adopted the standard approach of excluding mEPSCs with a rise time of
3 ms, as well as cells showing a negative correlation between mEPSC
amplitude and rise time (Rall, 1969). Only	4% of the total recorded
cells (at most, 1 cell per experimental group) were excluded due to negative
correlation between mEPSC rise and amplitude. One hundred consecutive
mEPSCs that met the rise-time criteria were analyzed from each
cell. AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated currents were measured at70
and40 mV, respectively. AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitudes were
measured at the peak of the current at70 mV. NMDAR-mediated
EPSC amplitudes were measured 100 ms after the stimulation artifact.

Results
BTA-EG
4
decreases Alevels in vitro
andin vivo
We examined the biological and pharmacokinetic
properties of BTA-EG
4
. BTAEG
4
readily crosses the blood–brain
barrier and is rapidly distributed to the
brain (Iyer et al., 2002) with an estimated
Log BB value of 0.43 (Fig. 1A,B). While it
is clear from these studies that BTA-EG
4
readily distributes to the brain, we make
this conclusion from the analysis of brain
and plasma samples of only four mice at
eachtimepoint(twodosedwithBTA-EG
4
and two dosed only with vehicle). The
quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter
values provided (Fig. 1B) should, therefore
, be considered only as estimated values.
We further found that daily injections
of BTA-EG
4
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) were well
tolerated in wild-type mice for 16 d, and
necropsy revealed no adverse effects on
major organs.
To test whether BTA-EG
4
alters A
productionin vitro, primary cortical neurons
were treated with BTA-EG
4
(1 or 5
M) or control (10% DMSO), and Alevels
were measured using ELISA. BTA-EG
4
significantly decreased A protein levels
(Fig. 1C). We then examined whether
BTA-EG
4
can alter A levels in vivo by
injecting wild-type mice daily for 2 weeks
with BTA-EG
4
(15 or 30 mg/kg, 10%
DMSO in saline, i.p.). We found that wild-type mice injected
with both doses of BTA-EG
4
had significantly decreased Apeptide
levels compared with controls (10% DMSO, i.p.) (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that BTA-EG
4
can also reduce Aproductionin vivo.
Furthermore, BTA-EG
4
altered APP processing in vivo,asmon -
itored by increased sAPP (-secretase cleavage product) and
decreased sAPP (-secretase cleavage product) levels in BTAEG
4
injected wild-type mice (30 mg/kg, i.p) compared with
control-injected mice (Fig. 1E–G). These findings suggest that
BTA-EG
4
promotes the -secretase-mediated metabolism of
APP at the expense of the -secretase pathway, which may explain
the reduction in A.
It is well known that the majority of-secretase activity occurs
on the cell surface, while- and-secretase activity occurs primarily
in the early and late endosomes (Huse et al., 2000;Reiss et
al., 2006). Thus, if APP is present at the cell’s surface, it is preferentially
cleaved by-secretase, resulting in decreased Aproduction.
Therefore, we examined whether BTA-EG
4
regulates cell
surface expression of APP. To test this initially, COS7 cells were
transfected with human APP and treated with BTA-EG
4
(5M)
or control (10% DMSO) for 24 h. After performing cell surface
biotinylation, we found that BTA-EG
4
increased cell surface APP
(Fig. 1H). Furthermore, BTA-EG
4
increased endogenous cell

surface APP levels in primary cortical
neurons following 24 h of BTA-EG
4
(5
M) treatment compared with control
(10% DMSO) treatment (Fig. 1I). In an
alternative approach to examine the effect
of BTA-EG
4
on cell surface APP expression
, we conducted live cell-surface immunostaining
in primary hippocampal
neurons. BTA-EG
4
treatment (5 M)in -
creased cell surface levels of APP relative
to vehicle control without affecting total
levels of APP (Fig. 1J–L). These results
suggest that BTA-EG
4
may reduce A
production by increasing the amount of
APP present at the cell surface.
BTA-EG
4
improves cognitive
performance in the absence of
enhanced long-term potentiation
Several studies have shown that A accumulation
contributes to cognitive deficits
(Chang et al., 2011; Che ´telat et al., 2012).
Since we observed that BTA-EG
4
decreases
A levels both in vitro and in vivo
(Fig. 1C,D), we then examined whether
BTA-EG
4
affects learning and memory.
The Morris water maze task was used
to assess cognitive performance in wildtype
mice injected with BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/
kg, i.p.) and controls. BTA-EG
4
-injected
wild-type mice exhibited significantly reduced
escape latency during training (Fig.
2A), which was accompanied by an increase
in swim speed (CTRL1173.1
mm/s, BTA1303.6 mm/s;p0.01),
but no difference in path length to the escape
platform (Fig. 2B). These findings
suggest that the apparent reduction in escape latency in the BTAEG
4
group may simply be a reflection of the effect of the drug on
swim speed. The fact that there is no change in the path length to
reach the platform, which is a measurement not affected by swim
speed, during the training trials suggests that BTA-EG
4
may not
improve the learning process. To test whether BTA-EG
4
affects
memory, we ran probe trials to measure the percentage of time
spent in the correct quadrant and the number of platform crossings.
We found that BTA-EG
4
-injected wild-type mice spent
more time in the target quadrant and showed a significantly
higher rate of platform crossing during probe trials (Fig. 2C,D),
suggesting that BTA-EG
4
improves memory in this standard spatial
memory task.
We also conducted a fear-conditioning paradigm as an alternative
method to measure the effect of BTA-EG
4
on cognitive
performance. We found that 30 mg/kg BTA-EG
4
-injected wildtype
mice showed significantly increased freezing in both the
contextual and cued tests (Fig. 2E,F), suggesting that BTA-EG
4
improves cognitive performance.
Several studies have demonstrated that synaptic plasticity is
correlated with learning and memory (Kandel, 2001;VanGuilder
et al., 2011). Therefore, we examined whether improved cognitive
performance following BTA-EG
4
treatment is associated
with altered synaptic function and plasticity. We conducted electrophysiology
experiments in an acute hippocampal slice preparation
from wild-type mice injected with BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/kg,
i.p.) or control solution (10% DMSO, i.p) for 2 weeks. At the SC
inputs to CA1, BTA-EG
4
did not alter basal synaptic transmission
or presynaptic function (Fig. 3A,B). Long-term potentiation
(LTP) was either normal or reduced, depending on the induction
protocol (Fig. 3C,D). Unexpectedly, the summation of synaptic
responses during the LTP induction protocol was reduced (Fig.
3E,F), which suggests that the normal LTP expression is likely
due to an upregulation of a downstream signaling cascade. Recent
evidence suggests that TA inputs to CA1, rather than SC
inputs to CA1, support water maze-type learning (Nakashiba et
al., 2008). BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment reduced the ability
to recruit presynaptic axons per stimulation intensity at TA inputs
to CA1 (Fig. 3H, left), but there was no difference in synaptic
transmission when responseswere normalized to the presynaptic
fiber volley amplitude (Fig. 3H, right). There was also not a
change in presynaptic function (Fig. 3I). Similar to SC inputs
to CA1, LTP at TA inputs also showed a similar reduction in
the magnitude of LTP (Fig. 3J), which occurred in the absence
of a change in the response summation during the induction
protocol (Fig. 3K). Collectively, these results support the idea
that the benefit of BTA-EG
4
to improved cognitive performance
is not through enhancing LTP.
BTA-EG
4
increases spinogenesisin vivo
There is precedence that cognitive performance correlates better
with dendritic spine density rather than LTP magnitude (Hayashi

et al., 2004;Morgado-Bernal, 2011). Since
we observed that BTA-EG
4
improves
memory without enhancing LTP, we hypothesized
that BTA-EG
4
promotes cognitive
performance by increasing spine
density. To test this idea, wild-type mice
were injected with BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/kg)
or control for 2 weeks. Subsequently, we
performed Golgi staining and found that
BTA-EG
4
-treated mice showed significantly
increased dendritic spine density in
the CA1 region of the hippocampus and
cortical layers II/III (Fig. 4A–F). However
, BTA-EG
4
did not alter spine morphology
, including spine head width and
spine length, in these areas (Fig. 4G–J).
These data suggest that BTA-EG
4
promotes
dendritic spine formation without
affecting spine morphology.
BTA-EG
4
requires APP to increase
dendritic spine density
To examine whether BTA-EG
4
acts via
APP to increase dendritic spine density,
we acutely knocked down APP using
shRNA in primary hippocampal neurons.
APP shRNA was cotransfected with GFP
to visualize dendritic spines, and control
cultures were transfected with GFP and
PLL (control vector for shRNA construct
). We then treated both cultures
with BTA-EG
4
(5 M) or vehicle. We
found that knockdown of APP on its own
showed a trend of a decrease in dendritic
spine density and prevented the increase
in dendritic spine density with BTA-EG4
treatment (Fig. 5A,B), which suggests
that BTA-EG
4
can only increase dendritic
spine density in the presence of APP. To
confirm this findingin vivo, we examined
the effect of BTA-EG
4
on dendritic spine
densityinAPPKOmice.APPKOmicewere
injected with BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/kg) or vehicle
for 2 weeks, and Golgi analysis was conducted
on hippocampal CA1 neurons. In
APP KOs, we did not find a statistically significant
increase in dendritic spine density
following BTA-EG
4
treatment (Fig. 5C,D).
This observation suggests that the ability of
BTA-EG
4
to promote spinogenesis is dependent
on APP.
BTA-EG
4
increases the number of functional
excitatory synapses
Next, we examined whether the increase in dendritic spine density
following BTA-EG
4
treatment reflects an increase in the number of
functional excitatory synapses. Primary hippocampal neurons were
treated with BTA-EG
4
(5 M) or control, and immunostained
with synaptic markers. We found that BTA-EG
4
increased the
number of puncta stained for synaptophysin (presynaptic
marker) and PSD-95 (postsynaptic marker) (Fig. 6A–C).
To verify that the increase in dendritic spine density and synaptic
proteins reflects an increase in functional synapses, we mea-

sured mEPSCs from CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices
followingin vivoadministration of BTA-EG
4
(30 mg/kg, i.p.) for
2 weeks. Consistent with an increase in functional synapses, BTAEG
4
significantly increased the frequency of mEPSCs compared
with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6D). There was no significant
difference in the average mEPSC amplitude (Fig. 6E), suggesting
no postsynaptic alteration in synaptic strength. Furthermore, we
did not observe a change in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (Fig. 6F),
which suggests that the new synapses likely contain both
NMDAR and AMPAR at normal levels.
To test whether the increase in functional excitatory synapses
occurs via cell surface recruitment of glutamate receptors, we performed
steady-state surface biotinylation using acute hippocampal
slices obtained from mice injected with BTA-EG

(30 mg/kg) or
control vehicle for 2 weeks. Both the cell surface and total levels of
major AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2, as well as NMDAR subunits

significant change in cell surface or total expression of any of these
proteins in hippocampal slices from BTAEG
4
-treated mice (Fig. 6G–J). These data
suggest that BTA-EG
4
does not regulate cell
surface or total expression of AMPAR or
NMDAR. Hence, the increase in the number
of functional synapses is likely due to
lateral recruitment of existing cell surface
glutamate receptors to new spines.
BTA-EG
4
alters synapse formation
through Ras signaling
We next investigated the molecular mechanism
by which BTA-EG
4
may alter dendritic
spine formation. Ras, a small
GTPase, is involved in dendritic spine formation
and synaptic delivery of AMPA receptors
(Zhu et al., 2002;Lee et al., 2011).
Moreover, abnormal Ras signaling is associated
with neurodegenerative disease,
causing cognitive impairments and learning
deficits (Stornetta and Zhu, 2011).
Thus, we initially investigated the effect
of BTA-EG
4
on Ras signaling by treating
primary hippocampal neurons with
BTA-EG
4
(5 M) or control for 24 h.
Interestingly, we found that BTA-EG
4
increased levels of RasGRF1, a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor involved in
Ras activation (Lee et al., 2010), as measured
by immunofluorescence (Fig.
7A,H). Further, levels of active Ras
were elevated following BTA-EG
4
treatment
(5 M) in primary cortical neurons
(Fig. 7B,H) and following BTAEG
4
treatment (30 mg/kg) in wild-type
mice (Fig. 7C,H). We also examined
whether BTA-EG
4
can alter the activity
of downstream Ras signaling proteins,
including p-ERK and p-CREB. We
found that BTA-EG
4
(5 M) increased
the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB,
the active forms of the signaling molecules
downstream of Ras, without
altering total ERK or CREB levels
(Fig. 7D–H).
To examine whether the effect of BTA-EG
4
on dendritic spine
formation is Ras dependent, primary hippocampal neurons were
transfected with GFP and RasGRF1 shRNA, or GFP and PLL. After
24 h, we treated with BTA-EG
4
(5M) or control for another 24 h,
and spine density was measured using immunofluorescence. Consistent
with our findings above, BTA-EG
4
significantly increased
dendritic spine density; however, RasGRF1 knockdown prevented
the effect of BTA-EG
4
on dendritic spine formation (Fig. 7I,J). In
addition, primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP
and empty vector, GFP and Ras-WT, or GFP and RasN17 (inactive
Ras mutant). After 24 h, we then treated neurons with BTA-EG
4
(5
M) or control for 24 h, and spine density was measured. Ras-WT
alone or combined with BTA-EG
4
increased dendritic spine density
compared with control (Fig. 7K,L). RasN17 decreased dendritic
spine density compared with control, and BTA-EG
4
could no longer
increase dendritic spine density in the presence of RasN17 (Fig. 7K,L).
These results suggest that Ras signaling is necessary for mediating the
increase in dendritic spine density conferred by BTA-EG
4
.

APP interacts with RasGRF1 and
regulates Ras signaling proteins
Since we observed that BTA-EG
4
functions
through APP (Fig. 5) and requires
Ras signaling to increase spine density
(Fig. 7), we examined whether APP can
increase spine density through Ras signaling.
To test this, we examined whether
APP can interact with RasGRF1 by immunoprecipitating
APP from brain lysates of
wild-type mice, and probing for RasGRF1
(Fig. 8A). Interestingly, we found that
APP coimmunoprecipitates with Ras-
GRF1 (Fig. 8A). Results from immunoprecipitating
RasGRF1 and probing for
APP also indicated that RasGRF1 coimmunoprecipitates
with APP (Fig. 8B). Our
results indicate that RasGRF1 associates
with APPin vivo.
Next, to examine whether APP can alter
RasGRF1 levels, we examined the effect
of APP on Ras activity in APP
transgenic mice and APP KO mice using a
GST pull-down assay (Fig. 8C–E). We
found that Ras activity was elevated in
1-month-old APP transgenic mice (overexpressing
APP without Apathology at 1
month), but decreased in 10-month-old
APP KO mice, compared with wild-type
mice (Fig. 8C–E). Furthermore, we examined
whether APP can alter the activity of
downstream Ras signaling proteins ERK
and CREB. First, to verify the effect of APP
on Ras signaling, primary hippocampal
neurons were transfected with GFP and
PLL or GFP and APP shRNA, and then immunostained against
RasGRF1. Knockdown of APP significantly decreased the levels
of RasGRF1 compared with control vector (Fig. 8F,I). We then
immunostained primary hippocampal neurons transfected with
GFP and PLL or GFP and APP shRNA against p-ERK and
p-CREB. We found that knockdown of APP decreased the phosphorylation
of ERK and CREB compared with control vector
(Fig. 8G–I). These data suggest that APP may regulate dendritic
spine formation through increases in Ras activity and downstream
Ras signaling pathways.
BTA-EG
4
requires APP to alter Ras signaling
Since we observed that BTA-EG
4
and APP could possibly regulate
dendritic spine density through Ras-dependent mechanisms, we
then examined whether BTA-EG
4
requires APP to modulate Ras
signaling. To test this hypothesis, primary hippocampal neurons
were transfected with GFP and APP shRNA or GFP and APP,
treated with control or BTA-EG
4
(5 M), then immunostained
against RasGRF1 (Fig. 9A,B). We found that knockdown of APP
did not increase RasGRF1 following BTA-EG
4
treatment compared
with control, while overexpression of APP significantly
increased RasGRF1 following BTA-EG
4
treatment compared
with control (Fig. 9A,B).
Next, we investigated whether BTA-EG
4
can alter Ras activity
in APP KO mice by injecting control or BTA-EG
4
for 2 weeks. We
found that BTA-EG
4
-injected APP KO mice did not have altered
Ras activity (Fig. 9C). Further, we examined the effect of BTAEG
4
on downstream Ras signaling in the presence or absence of
APP. For this experiment, primary hippocampal neurons were
transfected with GFP and APP shRNA or APP, treated with BTAEG
4
or control, and then immunostained against p-ERK or
p-CREB. We found that BTA-EG
4
was ineffective at increasing
p-ERK or p-CREB following knockdown of APP, while overexpression
of APP significantly increasedp-ERK andp-CREB with
BTA-EG
4
treatment compared with control (Fig. 9D–G). These
data strongly support that BTA-EG
4
acts via APP to activate Rasdependent
signaling.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate that the A-targeting molecule
BTA-EG
4
reduces A levels by facilitating cell surface expression
of APP (Fig. 1). Wild-type mice treated with BTA-EG
4
exhibited improved cognitive performance without enhancement
of hippocampal LTP (Figs. 2, 3). Additionally, BTA-EG
4
promotes dendritic spine density, which was accompanied by an
increase in the number of functional synapses as determined by
elevated mEPSC frequency. Moreover, BTA-EG
4
regulates dendritic
spine formation, potentially by increasing the activity of
Ras-ERK signaling proteins through APP (Figs. 7–9). Together,
these results strongly suggest that BTA-EG
4
works through APP
to increase dendritic spine density via a Ras ERK-dependent
mechanism.Inaddition,BTA-EG
4
warrantsfurtherinvestigation
to determine its effect in mouse models of AD.
BTA-EG
4
treatment regulates APP metabolism, resulting in
reduced Alevels and increased cell surface APP. It is known that
-secretase cleavage of APP forms Aalong the intracellular en-

dosomal pathway. Conversely, -secretase cleavage of APP occurs
at the cell surface and prevents A production (Hyman,
2011). Because BTA-EG
4
did not alter the levels of A degradation
enzymes (i.e., insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin; data
not shown), we believe BTA-EG
4
decreases A levels by specifically
increasing cell surface levels of APP, and thus, favoring processing
of APP by -secretase cleavage over processing by
-secretase.
Several recent studies have shown that Aaggregation is correlated
with deficits in learning and memory, and therapies that
decrease Acan rescue these deficits (Loane et al., 2009;Chang et
al., 2011). For instance, -secretase inhibitor (DAPT)-injected
mice had decreased A levels and improved behavioral performance
after traumatic brain injury (Loane et al., 2009). Other
studies using mouse models of AD showed reduced A levels
after treatment with either -secretase or histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors (Chang et al., 2011; Ricobaraza et al., 2011).
These therapies were also able to prevent or improve memory deficits
in AD mice. Furthermore, -secretase and HDAC inhibitors
increase LTP, increase dendritic spine density, and improve cognitive
performance (Townsend et al., 2010; Haettig et al., 2011). In
contrast to these results, we found that while BTA-EG
4
had positive
effects on cognitive performance and dendritic spine density, it did
so without a correlated increase in the magnitude of LTP at both SC
and TA inputs to CA1 (Fig. 3). This finding implies that BTA-EG
4
improves cognitive performance through an LTP-independent
mechanism, and suggests that targeting spine density alone may be
sufficient to improve cognitive function.
We found that BTA-EG
4
specifically acts to increase the number
of functional synapses, but individual synapses are not stronger.
The lack of an increase in LTP magnitude suggests that the
new synapses are available for synaptic plasticity, but there is no
enhancement of LTP due to the addition of new synapses. While
our LTP findings defy the conventional interpretation of the role
of LTP in memory formation, it is not an isolated case. Indeed, in
the PAK transgenic model, decreased dendritic spine density was
associated with a decrease in cognitive performance, but an enhancement
of LTP magnitude (Hayashi et al., 2004). Combined
with our results, this suggests that an increase in the number of
dendritic spines and functional synapses confer benefits to cognitive
function. The reduction in LTP magnitude seen in some
cases may be a homeostatic adjustment to the increase in synapse
number. For example, higher synaptic density may increase the
LTP induction threshold to prevent overexcitation of neuronal
activity. This presents an interesting point by implying that creating
new synapses may benefit cognitive function not by enhancing
LTP at individual synapses, but by allowing more
synaptic contact points to form along the dendrite for potential
information storage. It is of interest to note that some of the APP
transgenic AD mouse models display larger LTP in younger age
(Marchetti and Marie, 2011; Wang et al., 2012). It would be of
interest to know whether BTA-EG
4
treatment in these young AD
mouse models would show beneficial effects. While BTA-EG
4
significantly increased dendritic spine density in cortical layers
II/III and the hippocampal CA1 region, this occurred without
changes in dendritic spine morphology. Longer and thinner dendritic
spines are characterized as immature “plastic” spines, while
shorter and wider dendritic spines are characterized as mature
“memory” spines (Kasai et al., 2002; Yasumatsu et al., 2008).
Thus, BTA-EG
4
increases dendritic spine density without changing
the proportion of immature and mature spines.
Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which
BTA-EG
4
regulates dendritic spine density. One possibility is that
BTA-EG
4
may act through a Ras-dependent mechanism because
Ras signaling not only plays an important role in dendritic spine
formation, but also in neuronal degeneration (Saini et al., 2009;
Ye and Carew, 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Stornetta and Zhu, 2011).
For instance, AD mice models have increased synaptic depression
, which results in decreased activity and levels of RasGRF1, as
well as downstream Ras signaling proteins. In contrast, AD patients
have increased activity of Rap effectors, including p-JNK,
which is accompanied by the removal of synaptic AMPA receptors
(Savage et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2002; Stornetta and Zhu,
2011). Interestingly, we observed that BTA-EG
4
promotes Ras-
ERK signaling (Fig. 7). BTA-EG
4
treatment increased RasGRF1
levels and Ras activity as well as activation of downstream Ras
signaling proteins, includingp-ERK. We found that Ras activity is
necessary for spinogenesis induced by BTA-EG
4
, which suggests
that one of the main signaling pathways involved in BTA-EG
4
action is via its ability to activate Ras. Therefore, BTA-EG
4
has the
potential to reverse the decrease in Ras signaling seen in AD.
How does BTA-EG
4
activate Ras signaling to increase spine
density? One possibility is that BTA-EG
4
binds directly to A to
prevent negative functional effects, resulting in protection
against synapse loss. We also have data to demonstrate that BTAEG
4
promotes cell surface expression of APP, which is known to
increase dendritic spine formation (Lee et al., 2010). Here, our
novel finding provides evidence that APP promotes spinogenesis
through direct or indirect interaction with RasGRF1 to increase
Ras activity and downstream signaling to promote spinogenesis
(Fig. 8). Furthermore, the action of BTA-EG
4
on dendritic spine
formation and Ras activity both required APP (Fig. 9). While this
does not rule out the possibility that BTA-EG
4
acts via neutralizing
A, the more parsimonious explanation is that BTA-EG
4
promotes APP signaling to enhance Ras-dependent spinogenesis.
Whether the effect of BTA-EG
4
on APP signaling is strictly
through enhancing cell surface APP levels or preventing
-cleavage of APP, perhaps via direct binding to the Adomain
of APP, remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, there is evidence
that A and full-length APP often produce opposite signaling
(Hoe et al., 2012); hence, the dual role of BTA-EG
4
in
reducing A and promoting APP signaling is likely conferring
benefit to synaptic and cognitive function.
Together, our results strongly suggest that BTA-EG
4
treatment
decreases A levels and improves cognitive performance.
Moreover, BTA-EG
4
increases dendritic spine density through
APP- and Ras-dependent mechanisms. Thus, this novel small
molecule exhibits potential as a drug candidate for AD treatment
and warrants further studies to determine its effect in mouse
models of AD.
