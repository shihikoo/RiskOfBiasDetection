Abstract Aim: Whether arteries are affected in mitochondrial disorders (MIDs) was under
debate for years but meanwhile there are strong indications that large and small arteries
are primarily or secondarily affected in MIDs.
Data synthesis: When reviewing the literature for appropriate studies it turned out that
vascular involvement in MIDs includes primary or secondary micro- or macroangiopathy of
the cerebral, cervical, and retinal arteries, the aorta, the iliac arteries, the brachial arteries,
or the muscular arteries. Arteriopathy in MIDs manifests as atherosclerosis, stenosis, occlusion,
dissection, ectasia, aneurysm formation, or arteriovenous malformation. Direct evidence for
primary cerebral microangiopathy comes from histological studies and indirect evidence from
imaging and perfusion studies of the brain. Microangiopathy of the retina is highly prevalent in
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. Macroangiopathy of the carotid arteries may be complicated
by stroke. Arteriopathy of the aorta may result in ectasia, aneurysm formation, or even
rupture. Further evidence for arteriopathy in MIDs comes from the frequent association of
migraine with MIDs and the occurrence of premature atherosclerosis in MID patients without
classical risk factors.
Conclusions: Mitochondrial arteriopathy most frequently concerns the cerebral arteries and
may result from the underlying metabolic defect or secondary from associated vascular risk
factors. Vascular involvement in MIDs has a strong impact on the prognosis and outcome of
these patients.

Introduction
Since the first description of stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in
patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactacidosis
and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome it is under
debate whether or not arteries are involved in the pathogenesis
of SLEs [1]. It is also unclear whether arteries are
generally affected or not by the metabolic defect causing
a mitochondrial disorder (MID). During recent years,
however, a number of indications have been provided
revealing that there is indeed involvement of small or large
arteries of various organs in various MIDs. The following
review aims at summarizing and discussing recent findings
concerning the primary affection and involvement of
arteries in MIDs. Table 1
Types of arteriopathy in MIDs
Generally, arteriopathy in MIDs may be primary or secondary.
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy is due to affection of
arterial structures (endothelium, muscularis, adventitia,
pericytes(connective tissuecell that covers endothelialcells
to form a capillary)) by the underlying metabolic defect,
resulting in the destruction of the vessel wall (primary
atherosclerosis) consecutive stenosis, occlusion, dissection.
rupture, or aneurysm formation. Secondary arteriopathy in
MIDs may result from risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or arterial hypertension, which
are frequently found in MIDs and are the cause of secondary
atherosclerosis in these patients. Secondary arteriopathy
may accompany primary arteriopathy why it is often difficult
to distinguish between these entities. Aneurysm formation in
MID patients with arterial hypertension may be another
secondary arteriopathy in MIDs. Secondary arteriopathies
were not the topic of this review.
Location of mitochondrial arteriopathy
In primary as well as secondary mitochondrial arteriopathy
small (microangiopathy) or large arteries (macroangiopathy)
may be affected. There is direct and indirect evidence that
the microangiopathy in MIDs is more prevalent than macroangiopathy
but no systematic studies on this matter are
available so far. Affected arteries in mitochondrial arteriopathy
may be the intra-cerebral arteries, the extracranial
arteries, the retinal arteries, the aorta, the iliac arteries, the
brachial arteries, or arteries of the skeletal muscle. Among
these, mitochondrial arteriopathy most frequently affects
the intra-cerebral arteries and the intra-muscular arteries
but generally all vascular beds may be affected.

and increased number of mitochondria with concentric
whorls of cristae in pericytes and vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs) [2]. In an autopsy study of a 13yo girl with
MELAS syndrome generalised mitochondrial microangiopathy
with reduced COX-activity but normal enzyme
content were observed in the cerebrum, muscle and
myocardium [3]. MELAS syndrome is one of the most
frequent syndromic MIDs and clinically characterized by
predominant central nervous system involvement, manifesting
as stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, migraine-like
headache, confusion, or cognitive decline. Other organs
are frequently also affected. MELAS syndrome is the MID
with the highest evidence of primary mitochondrial arteriopathy.
In a neuropathological study on individual neurons
from several brain regions of two MELAS patients carrying
the m.3243A>G mutation the number of cytochrome-coxidase
(COX)-negative neurons was low but COX-
deficiency was most pronounced and the heteroplasmy
rate highest in walls of the leptomeningeal and cortical
blood vessels in all brain regions [4].
Indirect evidence
Indirect evidence for cerebral small vessel disease in MIDs
comes from MRI-studies of the cerebrum showing that the
distribution of the white matter lesions (WMLs) frequently
observed in MIDs mimics leukaraiosis and is often similar
to that seen in other hereditary small vessel diseases, such
as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with stroke
and ischemic leucencephalopathy (CADASIL), X-linked
Fabry’s disease, hereditary cerebroretinal vasculopathy, or
homocystinuria, which causes premature atherosclerosis
[5]. Though it is often difficult to differentiate such
lesions from those resulting from demyelination, single
histological studies have provided evidence that the
lesions seen on MRI represent indeed mitochondrial
arteriopathy.
Another strong argument for arteriopathy in MIDs is the
occurrence of SLEs in some of the MIDs but most frequently
in MELAS syndrome. SLEs are believed to be
microangiopathy-related, neurovascular events [6] that
may present as stroke-like lesions (SLLs) on imaging studies,
characterised by a mixture of cytotoxic and vasogenic
edema within these lesions [7]. In the acute and subacute
stages of SLLs there may be cortical hyperintensity on
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with corresponding
hypointensity on ADC [8], a pattern typical for cytotoxic
edema due to ischemia. The subcortical areas on the
contrary may show hyperintensity on DWI as well as on ADC
maps suggesting vasogenic edema [8]. However, acute SLL
may also present with hyperintensity of the cortical as well
as subcortical areas on DWI and ADC [8]. During the acute
stage of the disease angiography is usually normal [9]. In 
the chronic stage of a SLL, on the contrary, single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows hypoperfusion
in this area [10]. A study of 35 MELAS patients
measuring the cerebral blood flow by means of the statistical
parametric mapping (SPM) SPECT showed areas of
hyper- and hypoperfusion, coexisting within a single strokelike
lesion[11]. L-arginine administered intravenously in the
acute stage of a SLE and orally during the chronic stage of
a SLE significantly reduced the extension of hyper- as well
as hypoperfusion [11]. When investigating patients with
MELAS syndrome by perfusion-weighted imaging it turned
out that the cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume
are decreased during the acute stage of an SLE [12].
Particularly, mean transit time and time-to-peak were
prolonged both in lesional as well as non-lesional areas
[12]. SLEs are believed to result from dysfunction of
endothelial cells with consecutive vulnerability of the blood
brain barrier and vasogenic edema [6]. Vasogenic leakage
may also result from activation of calcitonin-gene related
peptide leading to hyperperfusion or even migraine [6]
Further indirect evidence for cerebral microangiopathy
comes from a SPECT study of three subjects carrying the
m.3243A>G mutation, which manifested as MELAS
syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), or
migraine-like headache [13]. The study showed decreased
perfusion in various cerebral areas but predominantly in the
posterior and temporal regions in an asymmetric distribution [13]. PEO is a maternally or autosomally inherited
condition characterized by ptosis and reduced flexibility of
the eye bulbs, initially without affection of other organs.
Additional evidence for arteriopathy in MIDs comes from
a study on 13 patients with MELAS syndrome showing
decreased CO
2
reactivity of the median cerebral artery
under hypocapnic or hypercapnic conditions as assessed by
transcranial Doppler ultrasound [14]. These patients also
showed crossed cerebral diaschisis. In patients with Leigh
syndrome capillary shunting was documented by MRI in
normal and abnormal cerebral regions [9]. In a study on
Ethe-deficient mice it has been shown that microangiopathy
in patients carrying a ETHE1 mutation is
attributable to a deficiency in ethyl-malonic dioxigenase
[15]. Deficiency of ethyl-malonic dioxigenase results in
insufficient detoxification of sulfides, which are powerful
inhibitors of COX and of short-chain fatty-acid oxidation
with vasoactive and vasotoxic effects, explaining microangiopathy [15].
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the retinal
arteries
In addition to the cerebral arteries, microangiopathy in
MIDs may also manifest in retinal arteries. Retinal arteriopathy
particularly occurs in Leber’s hereditary optic
neuropathy (LHON). LHON is clinically characterized by
acute onset visual loss in early adulthood due to optic
atrophy. Both eyes become affected either simultaneously
or sequentially. Though the diagnosis of LHON requires per
definition the presence of a retinal microangiopathy, it is
not present in all genetically confirmed LHON cases. In
a study on 107 patients with LHON, retinal microangiopathy
was present in only 64% of them [16]. This is why retinal
arteriopathy should be abandoned as an imperative diagnostic
criterion but should be regarded as a facultative
diagnostic criterion for LHON. Retinal arteries in LHON
typically show increased tortuosity (twisted vessels) and
ectasias [16e20]. Vascular involvement typically shows
a dynamic course. Microangiopathy may be even found in
non-manifesting carriers of the disease[20]. Only in a single
patient, an old female with LHON, visual impairment due to
peripapillary microangiopathy recovered spontaneously
[21].
Primary arteriopathy in mitochondrial disorders 395

Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the cochlear
arteries
There are indications that also the small arteries of the
cochlea are involved in MIDs. In three patients with MELAS
syndrome bilateral adult-onset, sensori-neural hearing loss
was located rather to the cochlea than retrocochlear sites.
Hearing loss was assumed to result from affection of the
stria vascularis, hair cells, or of neurons of the auditory
pathway [22]. Whether impaired perfusion of the inner ear
indeed plays a role in the pathogenesis of hearing loss,
which is a frequent phenotypic feature of MIDs, remains to
be elucidated.
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the cervical
arteries
In three patients with ischemic stroke due to spontaneous
dissection of the internal carotid artery (nZ 2) and the
posterior cerebral artery (n Z 1) muscle biopsy showed
ragged-red muscle fibers and decreased SDH and COX-
staining [23]. Serum lactate was elevated in one of these
patients. From these findings it was concluded that spontaneous
dissection is attributable to mitochondrial arteriopathy
without providing histological evidence for
mitochondriopathy at the site of the dissection [23]. In 
a single patient carrying the m.617G > A mutation in the
tRNA(Phe) gene, recurrent embolic ischemic strokes were
observed [6]. Strokes were accompanied by transient
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, the anterior cerebral
artery and the internal carotid artery [6]. It was
assumed that strokes resulted from artery-to artery
embolism originating from an internal carotid artery
stenosis, being attributable to no other cause than the
underlying MID [6].
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the aorta
and iliac arteries
Affection of the aorta has been recently recognised as
a manifestation of MIDs and may manifest as dilation,
aneurysm formation or even rupture of the vessel. In
a study of 48 patients with non-syndromic MIDs, 10 presented
with dilation of the aortic root as expressed by an
individual Z-score > 2 [24]. Also the mean Z-score was
significantly increased (þ1.14  1.29 (CI 95% þ 0.77
to þ 1.52)), which is 0 by definition [24]. A 15yo girl with
MELAS syndrome experienced spontaneous rupture of the
thoracic aorta during gastrostomy insertion [25]. During the
unsuccessful attempt to repair the rupture, it was noted
that the aorta was extremely friable. At autopsy, the aorta
was macroscopically normal but microscopic examination
revealed disorganized smooth muscle layers and disrupted
elastic layers [25]. Staining for COXI was decreased in VSMC
and endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum in the adventitial
layer [25]. Interestingly, the patient’s mother had died
several years earlier of a major vessel rupture during
angiography [25]. Affection of the iliac arteries was
recently reported in a 54yo patient with Leriche syndrome,
caused by premature atherosclerosis of the iliac arteries
[26]. Classical risk factors were absent in this patient and
he was regularly going on for sport activities [26]. Further
evidence for involvement of the mitochondrial metabolism
in the formation of aortic aneurysms is the finding that
perfusion of rat aortas with elastase results in aneurysm
formation of the aorta by activation of caspase-9, the key
initiator of the intrinsic apoptosis. Apoptosis concerned
VSMCs, macrophages, and neutrophils as shown by transmission
electron microscopy and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin
nick end labeling (TUNEL) [27]. It was concluded that
mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis is involved in abdominal
aortic aneurysm formation [27].
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the brachial
arteries
Affection of the endothelium in MIDs has been demonstrated
in a study on 35 Japanese patients with MELAS
syndrome [11]. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was
measured by means of the endothelium-dependent brachial
artery diameter response to hyperemic flow with highresolution
ultrasonography before and 2 h respectively 2y
after oral administration of L-arginine in a dosage of 4g.
FMD refers to the change in diameter of an artery as
assessed by ultrasound in response to release of an inflated
cuff proximal to the site of measurement. FMD was
generally reduced in MELAS patients. Additionally, L-arginine
improved the FMD in MELAS patients not only 2 h after
intake but more pronounced after 2y [11]. It was concluded
that there is not only endothelial dysfunction in MELAS but
improvement of endothelial dysfunction by L-arginine [11].
Primary mitochondrial arteriopathy of the skeletal
muscle arteries
Direct evidence for involvement of the muscular arteries in
MIDs comes from histological studies of muscle biopsies
showing that structures of the small arteries are indeed
abnormal compared to healthy subjects [28]. Particularly,
succinat dehydrogenase (SDH) staining may show marked
hyperreactivity of the arterial walls, also known as
strongly-succinate dehydrogenase-reactive vessels (SSV)
[11]. Presence of SSV in the muscle biopsy was also reported
in a study on MELAS patients with SLEs [12]. Electron
microscopy revealed cristae swelling and striking increase
in the number of mitochondria in VSMCs and endothelial
cells [12]. SSV were not only reported in patients with
MELAS syndrome [7,29e31] but also in patients with PEO
[32], MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibres,
clinically characterised by myoclonic epilepsy and myopathy
) syndrome [33], MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome [34],
and non-syndromic MID [35]. SSV are usually normal for COX
[33] but in a study of five patients with MERRF syndrome,
SSV were negative for COX [33]. In a 14yo boy with nonsyndromic
MID, muscle biopsy revealed vasculopathy with
swollen endothelial cells and increased number of mitochondria
and abnormal structure of mitochondria in pericytes
and VSMCs [36]. Further evidence for involvement of
the vessel wall in MIDs comes from a study on muscle
biopsies from patients with MIDs using the 3-nitro-tyrosin
stain [37]. This study showed that the arterial wall is
a target of oxidative/nitrative stress. Increased oxidative/

(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.2033974658)
nitrative stress reduces NO bioactivity in arterial walls as
shown by increased 3-nitro-tyrosin expression on immunohistochemistry
and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
particularly in the endothelium and smooth muscle
cells of the small vessels from MID patients as compared to
controls [37]. Additionally, the flow-mediated vasodilation
(FMD) was reduced in MID patients whereas the baseline
arterial diameter, blood flow velocity, and endotheliumindependent
dilatation were similar to controls [37].
Premature atherosclerosis
An argument for arteriopathy in MIDs is the finding of
primary premature atherosclerosis in some of the MID
patients in the absence of classical risk factors. In a female
with MELAS syndrome premature atherosclerosis of the
large cerebral arteries was detected on clinical and pathoanatomic
investigations [38]. Premature atherosclerosis of
the iliac arteries in the absence of classical risk factors was
also reported in a 54yo patient with Leriche syndrome [26].
Despite excessive sport activity (cycling), this patient
developed occlusion of both iliac arteries [26]. He was
suspected to suffer from a MID based upon easy fatigability,
exercise intolerance, abnormal lactate increase on the
lactate stress test, mitochondrial myopathy on muscle
biopsy, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy [26].
Association with migraine
A further indicator for the presence of mitochondrial
arteriopathy is the frequent association of MIDs with
migraine (Table 2) [34,39]. From a neuropathological study
on two MELAS patients showing highest COX-deficiency and
highest heteroplasmy rates in leptomeningeal and cortical
arteries it was concluded that mitochondrial arteriopathy
coupled with cortical spreading depression may play
a pathogenetic role not only in the development of SLEs but
also in migraine [4]. Migraine or migraine-like headache has
been particularly reported in MIDs listed in Table 2.
Vascular malformations in MIDs
Though it is unknown if the prevalence of vascular malformation
is increased in MIDs, there are single reports
which show that vascular malformations occasionally occur
in patients with MIDs. A single male with LHON due to the
m.11778G>A mutation in the ND4 gene, experienced right
thalamic hemorrhage with intrusion to the ventricle at age
9y [40]. Angiography revealed an arteriovenous malformations
(AVM) extending from the right posterior thalamus to
the midbrain with feeders from the posterior thalamoperforate
artery [40]. No reports are available, which
describe cerebral aneurysms, cavernomas, or dural arteriovenous
fistulas in MIDs.
Conclusion
There is clear evidence that arteries can be primarily or
secondarily affected in MIDs. Most frequently the cerebral
arteries are affected although these findings derive from
cerebral imaging and perfusion studies and only few
autopsy or biopsy studies have been carried out. Second
most frequently the skeletal muscle is affected by mitochondrial
microangiopathy. Whether this finding is due to
the easy accessibility of muscle tissue or the frequent
affection of the skeletal muscle by the metabolic defect is
unknown. It is also unknown if the distribution of arteriopathy
varies within a family, between families, or
depending on the heteroplasmy rate or the type and location
of the mutation. Generally, it is conceivable that all
arteries are affected but, as with specific syndromic MIDs,
certain vessel beds may be more predominantly affected
than others. To which degree particularly mitochondrial
microangiopathy determines the phenotype of a MID is
poorly understood and requires further detailed investigations.
Further studies are warranted to investigate all open
questions, particularly the pathogenetic background of
mitochondrial arteriopathy and which regions are involved
in mitochondrial arteriopathy.
