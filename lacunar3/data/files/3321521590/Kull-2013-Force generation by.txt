Summary
Kinesins and myosins hydrolyze ATP, producing force that drives spindle assembly, vesicle transport and muscle contraction. How
do motors do this? Here we discuss mechanisms of motor force transduction, based on their mechanochemical cycles and
conformational changes observed in crystal structures. Distortion or twisting of the central b-sheet–proposedtotriggeractininduced P
i
and ADP release by myosin, and microtubule-induced ADP release by kinesins – is shown in a movie depicting the
transition between myosin ATP-like and nucleotide-free states. Structural changes in the switch I region form a tube that governs
ATP hydrolysis and P
i
release by the motors, explaining the essential role o f switch I in hydrolysis. Comparison of the motor power
strokes reveals that each stroke begins with the force-amplifying structure oriented opposite to the direction of rotation or swing.
Motors undergo changes in their mechanochemical cycles in response to small-molecule inhibitors, several of which bind to kinesins
by induced fit, trapping the motors in a state that resembles a force- producing conformation. An unusual motor activator specifically
increases mechanical output by cardiac myosin, potentially providin g valuable information about its mechanism of function. Further
study is essential to understand motor mechanochemical coupling and energy transduction, and could lead to new therapies to treat
human disease.

Introduction
Cytoskeletal motors have been intensively studied over the past
25 years, but our understanding of how force is produced by the
motors is still incomplete. The first crystal structure of a kinesin
motor domain (Kull et al., 1996) revealed an unexpected
structural homology between the kinesins and myosins – the
motor domain of both proteins is formed by the same core
structural elements, organized in the same way to form the
nucleotide- or filament-binding site on opposite sides of the
motor domain. These structural elements and their organization
are conserved within the kinesin and myosin superfamilies,
implying a common mechanism of force generation by the
motors. By contrast, the dyneins deviate in overall structure
from the kinesins and myosins, and presumably also in their
mechanism of energy transduction (Carter et al., 2011; Kon
et al., 2011; Kon et al., 2012; Ho ¨o ¨k and Vallee, 2012; Schmidt
et al., 2012). The focus of this Commentary is on the kinesins
and myosins, for which more is known regarding the motor
force-producing mechanism than for the dyneins. We discuss
the mechanochemical cycles of the motors and the
conformational changes they undergo, based on crystal
structures of the motors in different nucleotide states. We
propose possible force-producing mechanisms of the motors
and compare their working strokes. We also discuss smallmolecule
inhibitors of the kinesins and an activator of myosin,
whose analysis has resulted in further insights into motor
function. Further information on kinesin inhibitors can be found
in a recent review (Good et al., 2011).
Motor mechanochemical cycles and force
production
Molecular motor proteins are fascinating enzymes as they have
the ability to link chemical catalysis to the production of directed
force along a protein filament. The mechanism of force
production by motor proteins is not certain, but is thought to
involve structural changes in a deformable element of the motor
that undergoes changes in structure under load, creating strain,
followed by a strain-relieving structural change that causes the
element to recoil back into its original conformation, producing
force (Howard, 2001).
In order to produce force, motor proteins couple a chemical
cycle of ATP hydrolysis to a mechanical cycle of motor
interactions with its filament (Bustamante et al., 2004) (Fig. 1).
When coupled, the mechanochemical cycle of motor proteins can
be incredibly complex. Even at the simplest level, a minimal
chemical cycle involves ATP binding, hydrolysis, and subsequent
release of P
i
and ADP. These changes occur within the relatively
small motor domain of the protein and appear to involve small
movements by specific structural elements. The mechanical cycle
is coupled to the chemical cycle and involves binding to its
filament by the motor, a lever-like movement of a rigid structural
element and/or generation of strain that produces the large
displacements observed for the motors, release of the motor from
its filament and repositioning of the force-amplifying element(s)
in preparation for the next step (Fig. 2). A key goal in the field is
to determine how these mechanochemical cycles are coupled in
different motor proteins, which amino acids and structural motifs

Journal of Cell Science are crucial for the mechanochemistry of the motors, and how
motor proteins differ to fulfil specific cellular functions.
Several key components and capabilities are common to all
motor proteins. First, motors must be able to bind to and
hydrolyze nucleotide, and then release P
i
and ADP. Second, the
motor domain must be able to sense the presence or absence ofcphosphate
in the nucleotide-binding pocket. Response to this
seemingly small difference, for example, when ATP rather than
ADP is bound, triggers an initial conformational response that is
then transmitted to other regions of the motor protein, inducing a
force-producing conformational change and altering interactions
between the motor and its filament. Finally, for some motors,
such as many dimeric kinesins, processive movement – the
ability to take successive steps along its filament – requires
communication between the two heads, which is thought to be
achieved by chemical and/or physical ‘gating’, in which the
attached head remains bound until a chemical or mechanical
signal, such as binding of ATP by the front head or detachment of
the rear head from the microtubule (Rosenfeld et al., 2003; Yildiz
et al., 2008; Clancy et al., 2011), causes it to release. This would
keep the two heads working synchronously, so that both heads do
not release from the filament at the same time, which would
cause the motor to diffuse rapidly away from its filament.
Structural elements involved in force production
An important goal of the motors field is to identify the structural
elements that undergo conformational changes and the steps of
the ATP hydrolysis cycle in which they occur. Many of the
elements that are thought to play crucial roles in the
mechanochemical cycle of the kinesins and myosins have now
been identified (Box 1) through experimental approaches that
include structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and highresolution
cryoelecton microscopy, coupled to functional studies
by mutant analysis, together with kinetic assays and cell
biological studies.
In kinesins and myosins, several conserved structural motifs in
the nucleotide-binding pocket play a crucial role. These include the
P-loop, which interacts with the nucleotide and associated Mg2+
ion, primarily through the a-, b-and c-phosphates, and two loops,
switch I and switch II, which act as c-phosphate sensors (Vale,
1996) (Box 1). The P-loop, also called a Walker A motif (Walker
et al., 1982), has the consensus sequence GxxxxGK(T/S), and is
one of the most common protein motifs. In kinesins and myosins,
the P-loop has a more highly conserved sequence GQ(T/
S)xSGK(T/S). In addition to the P-loop, two other motifs are
essential for motor protein function, the so-called switch I and
switch II motifs (Sablin et al., 1996) (Box 1). As these flexible
switch regions are responsible for sensing the presence or absence
of c-phosphate, they move in and out of the nucleotide-binding
pocket by several angstroms during the catalytic cycle. Their
relatively small movements are transmitted to other regions of the
motor domain and amplified in different kinesins by the neck linker
(Rice et al., 1999) or coiled-coil stalk (Yun et al., 2003), or in
myosins by the converter (Houdusse and Cohen, 1996) and lever
arm (Rayment et al., 1993) (supplementary material Movies 1, 2
and 3, respectively).

frequently disordered in kinesins, which leads to an a-helix, helixa4
(referred to as the relay helix in myosins) (Box 1), on the opposite
side of the motor domain as the P-loop and switch I. In kinesins, this
helix is a major component of the microtubule-binding interface
(Fig. 2) and has been observed in a number of different nucleotidedependent
orientations and lengths. This pathway links the

structures that show one head of the dimeric motors docked onto a schematically represented filament. (A) Kinesin-5 Eg5 in the ADP state (left, PDB 1II6), the
ATP-like state (right, PDB 3HQD), and an intermediate interpolated between the two states (see supplementary material Movie 1). The microtubule-binding
elements (a4-L12-a5, magenta) interact with the microtubule. Loop L11, adjacent to helix a4, is also part of the major microtubule-binding complex, but is
frequently disordered in crystal structures, and is not shown here with the rest of the complex. Release of ADP and binding of ATP by the motor are associated
with movement of switch I (red) and a large change in the angle of the neck linker (blue), which extends toward the minus end in the ADP state (left), then swings
toward the plus end (black arrow) and docks onto the motor in the ATP-like state (right) (supplementary material Movie 1). Central b-sheet, tan; N-terminus,

in the same conformation as motor-ADP crystal structures – the pre-stroke state or ADP state (left) – whereas the other head (chain B) assumes a distinctly
different stalk-rotated conformation, which is thought to represent the post-stroke (Lakkaraju and Hwang, 2011) or ATP-bound state (Heuston et al., 2010) (right).
The Ncd stalk (green) tilts towards the plus end in the ADP state (left) and rotates toward the minus end (black arrow) when the motor releases ADP and binds
ATP (Endres et al., 2006; Hallen et al., 2011) (right) (supplementary material Movie 2). The microtubule-binding region conformation resembles that of kinesin-5
Eg5. (C) Myosin II in an ATP transition state (PDB 1DFL) (left) shows the lever arm (cyan) tilted towards the actin minus end; the motor undergoes large changes
as it hydrolyzes ATP and releases P

and ADP, transitioning into the nucleotide-free state (PDB 1DFK) (right), accompanied by a large rotation of the lever arm
(black arrow) towards the plus end (right) (supplementary material Movie 3). The so-called ‘relay’ helix (magenta) corresponds to helix a4 of the kinesins; it is
kinked in the ATP-like state (left) but straightens and rotates with the lever arm, converter (orange) and SH1 helix (blue) upon P

release and transition into the
nucleotide-free state (right). Microtubule (A), (B) and actin filament (C) schematic diagrams are oriented with the minus end to the left. Intermediate states

Journal of Cell Science Box 1. Motor elements involved in force production
Kinesin and myosin switch I and II regions share structural and functional similarities with G-proteins. Switch I (red), a flexible loop with the conserved sequence NxxSSR, assumes different con- formations during the force-generating cycle, switching between open (left) and closed con- formations (right), as shown in kinesin-5 Eg5, allowing the motors to function as c-phosphate sensors. Specific interactions of each switch element with the nucleotide determine whether it is in an open or closed conformation (Geeves and Holmes, 1999), although some differences exist between myosins and kinesins in the switch I open conformation. In the closed conformation, the side chain hydroxyl of the first serine interacts with the c-phosphate, and the side chain of the second serine forms a bond to the bound Mg 2+, moving towards the nucleotide from its position in the open conformation (Kull and Endow, 2002). In kinesins, the movement of switch I from open to closed occurswithachangeinitsstructurefromashort
a-helix (left) to an extended hairpin loop (right). In switch II, a loop with the conserved sequence DxxGxE, the closed conformation is defined by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the glycine and c-phosphate of the bound nucleotide (Kull and Endow, 2002). This interaction positions the loop 1–4 A ˚ closer to the nucleotide than its more variable open positions. When both switch regions are closed, a catalytically active Pi tube is formed (Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006; Sindelar and Downing, 2010) (Fig. 3), in which two key water molecules in the active site are positioned to allow a nucleophilic attack on the c-phosphate by one of them, leading to nucleotide hydrolysis (Fisher et al., 1995; Parke et al., 2010). The nucleotide-binding P-loop (green) shows the side chains interacting with the bound
nucleotide (AMP ?PNP, orange). Two water molecules (red sphere s) contribute to the octahedral coordination of the Mg 2+ (magenta). The P-loop conformation does not change substantially with or without bound nucleotide. The switch II loop (cyan) acts as a secondary c- phosphate sensor by forming a bond between the main chain amide of the conserved glycine
and c-phosphate of the bound nucleotide in the ‘closed’ conformation; the glycine has moved back too far to form this interaction in the ‘open’
conformation. Essential structural elements of kinesins and myosins shown in kinesin-5 Eg5. Left, nucleotide-binding P-loop (green), bound nucleotide (AMP?PNP, orange), switch I (red) and switch II (cyan). Right, microtubule-binding a4-L12-a5

Right, Eg5–AMP?PNP a4 and a5 have rotated, allowing the neck linker (blue; along with a6 C-terminus) to dock onto the motor. The loop extending from the N- terminal b-strand of the motor (yellow), the cover strand, has not been fully visualized in crystal structures, but is thought to interact with the kinesin-1 neck linker, forming a cover neck bundle.

the nucleotide in the catalytic pocket to be transmitted to the
microtubule-binding interface, and vice-versa.
The pathway of conformational changes leading from the
switch I region is less clear, but has come into focus recently
when a crystal structure of kinesin 5 (Eg5, also known as KSP),
in which both switch I and switch II are closed, was solved (Parke
et al., 2010). In addition to the helix-to-loop transition of switch I
between the open and closed states (Box 1), comparison of the
ADP and ATP-like (bound to the nonhydrolysable ATP analogue,
AMP?PNP) structures shows substantial movement of helix a3,
which is adjacent to helixa2 following the P-loop. As helixa3in
kinesins is adjacent to a region containing loop L8, which also
binds microtubules, it is possible that movements in switch I
provide a second, distinct pathway of communication between
the nucleotide-binding site and the microtubule-binding interface,
allowing for fine-tuning of the kinesin mechanochemical cycle.
It is also essential that changes in the microtubule-binding
region are transmitted to the regions of the motor that are
responsible for force generation. Interestingly, in kinesins this
appears to be governed primarily by the same movements in helix
a4, discussed above, that affect interactions with the microtubule
and are observed in the ATP-bound state. The C-terminus of
helix a4 in kinesins is close to helix a6, the last helix of the
conserved motor domain, as well as the N-terminus of the first bstrand
of the motor domain. In kinesin family members with an
N-terminal motor domain, helixa6 is followed by the neck linker
(Kozielski et al., 1997) (Box 1), which has been shown to be
crucial for movement (Clancy et al., 2011), whereas in C-
terminal kinesin motors, the neck helix precedes the firstb-strand
of the motor domain, b-strand 1. For both N-terminal and C-
terminal motors, movement of helix a4 allows the loop region
following helixa6 to pack down into a small pocket on the motor
core, which is also associated with rearrangement of the end ofbstrand
1. In this way, conformational changes in the nucleotidebinding
region are transmitted to the C-terminal end of helix a4,
resulting in nearly identical rearrangements of the loops C-
terminal to helix a6 and N-terminal to b-strand 1 in both the N-
and C-terminal kinesin motors (Heuston et al., 2010). At this
point, the N- and C-terminal kinesins diverge. In N-terminal,
plus-end directed kinesins, these movements result in a packing
of the neck linker against the motor core in the microtubule plus
direction (Box 1 and Fig. 2). In C-terminal, minus-end kinesins,
the initial movements appear to trigger a rotation of the helical
neck and coiled-coil stalk in the minus-end direction (Fig. 2).
Similarities in mechanochemistry between
kinesins and myosins
Although kinesin and myosin motor proteins are similar in that
they are both powered by ATP hydrolysis, it was unexpected
when the first kinesin crystal structure was shown to overlap with
the myosin motor core structure (Kull et al., 1996). Despite an
almost complete lack of sequence identity, a substantial
difference in size, and interactions with different cytoskeleton
filament tracks, the kinesin and myosin motor domains share a
common core composed of a seven-stranded b-sheet flanked by
six a-helices, three on each side of the b-sheet. Although each
family of motors has distinct insertions between these structural
elements, their topological order is the same, suggesting a
common evolutionary ancestor (Kull et al., 1998). Comparison of
the kinesin and myosin catalytic pockets shows that these motors
also share a number of common mechanistic features. Both have
P-loops as well as switch I and switch II motifs that are conserved
in sequence and structure between the two motor families
(described above), and both have a helix known as the relay helix
in the myosins and helix a4 in the kinesins (Fig. 2). All of the
conserved active site residues make similar interactions with the
nucleotide and bound Mg2+. Furthermore, comparison of myosin
and kinesin crystal structures determined in the presence of
different nucleotides show similar movements and
rearrangements of switch I and switch II as they transition
between open and closed conformations. This similarity in active
site elements is shared with G-proteins, which bind to and
hydrolyze GTP and function as molecular switches, cycling
between GTP-bound active forms and GDP-bound inactive forms
(Bourne et al., 1991). Although the P-loop, and switch I and II
regions of G-proteins share a very similar structure to those of
kinesin and myosin, their sequence motifs differ somewhat (Vale,
1996).
Even though substantial differences exist between the kinesin
and myosin motors in their mechanochemistry, more similarities
than differences exist when they are closely compared. That is,
kinesin and myosin hydrolyze ATP at different points in their
mechanical cycles – kinesin, while bound to microtubules, and
myosin, while detached from actin. However, this is not due to
substantial changes in the nucleotide state-induced
conformational changes in the motor, but is caused by the
mechanical and chemical cycles of kinesin and myosin being out
of phase with respect to one another (Fig. 1B,C). For kinesins,
microtubule binding results in loss of ADP from the motor
domain, which is followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis,
coupled to a force-generating conformational change, and
subsequent release of P
i
by the motor and release of the ADP-
bound motor domain from the microtubule. By contrast, myosin
binding to actin induces a conformational change leading to the
release of P
i
and a force-producing rotation of the lever arm.
ADP is then lost, resulting in the rigor state, and ATP binding
then releases myosin from actin, at which point hydrolysis
occurs, repositioning the lever arm for the next cycle. In both
motors, the order of conformational changes is the same, and the
changes themselves are very similar. What is different is the
function of the filament in each motor – for kinesins,
microtubules act both as a nucleotide exchange factor, and,
perhaps more importantly, as an activator of the motor ATPase
(Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006), whereas for myosin, actin
functions exclusively as a nucleotide exchange factor.
From this common mechanochemistry, kinesins and myosins
have subtly diverged in parts of the cycle to adapt to their specific
cellular roles. For example, in kinesins, the loop between switch
II and helix a4 (the relay helix of myosins), loop L11, is longer
than the analogous loop in myosin and is frequently disordered in
kinesin crystal structures. It has been suggested that this loop
becomes stabilized upon microtubule binding and forms an
extension of helix a4 (Hirose et al., 2006; Kikkawa and
Hirokawa, 2006; Nitta et al., 2008; Sindelar and Downing,
2010). Helix a4 forms the primary microtubule-binding site, and
acts as a fixed fulcrum upon which the plus-end directed kinesin-
1 motor domain can tilt (Sindelar and Downing, 2010). In the
ADP and nucleotide-free states, switch II would be open and the
kinesin-1 motor tilted toward the minus direction. ATP binding
then induces a tilt towards the plus end, closing switch II and
activating the ATPase in a microtubule-dependent manner. In
myosin, the corresponding loop between switch II and the relay

helix is much shorter, so that the connection between them is
stronger – because ATP hydrolysis occurs when myosin is
detached from actin and functions to reposition the relay helix,
converter domain and lever arm, a tight link between the relay
helix and switch II is necessary.
One structural feature of myosin that has not yet been captured
in kinesin crystal structures is seen in the nucleotide-free state of
myosin V (Coureux et al., 2003) and myosin II (Reubold et al.,
2003). In these structures, a substantial rearrangement of the core
b-sheet has occurred, resulting in a more pronounced twist
compared with the nucleotide-bound structures (supplementary
material Movie 4). This twist causes the actin-binding cleft in
myosin to close, which is predicted to occur during rigor binding
to actin, and also moves switch I almost 10 A ˚ away from the
nucleotide-binding site, thereby disrupting the interactions
between switch I and the nucleotide and Mg2+.
Structural analysis of the nucleotide-free conformation of
myosin and comparisons with crystal and EM structures of
kinesin suggest possible mechanisms for two steps in the motor
mechanism that remain unclear: microtubule-induced ADP
release in kinesins and actin-induced P
i
release in myosin. In
kinesin, it is clear that ADP can remain bound with relatively
high affinity, even when switch I is open, as this has been
observed in a number of crystal structures. Therefore, release of
ADP upon microtubule binding could occur in kinesin if filament
binding induces a twisted-sheet conformation, thus opening
switch II even more and disrupting all interactions with the
Mg2+?ADP, as in the nucleotide-free myosin structures.
Comparison of high-resolution (10–12 A ˚ ) cryo-electron
microscopy images of kinesin–microtubule complexes in the
nucleotide-free and ADP states shows density in the b-sheet
region that is unaccounted for, and which might be due to such a
twist of the central b-sheet (Hirose et al., 2006).
Following hydrolysis, it is clear that P
i
must exit the
nucleotide-binding pocket by a path that differs from that of
ATP entry, as Mg2+?ADP, switch I and switch II completely
cover the P
i
in both kinesin and myosin. It has been suggested
that P
i
release in myosin occurs through a ‘back door’ opening at
the back of the active site, which is observed in a number of
myosin structures (Yount et al., 1995; Sweeney and Houdusse,
2010; Llinas et al., 2012). However, this opening is not observed
in the rigor-like myosin structures. Furthermore, there is no
evidence for a back door in kinesin or G-proteins, and several
studies suggest that P
i
could not be released through this route
(Lawson et al., 2004; Kaliman et al., 2009), casting doubt on this
theory. An alternate route for P
i
release that would be consistent
for both kinesin and myosin structures involves the opening of
switch I. This could occur in a manner similar to that observed in
the nucleotide-free myosin structures, where closing of the actinbinding
cleft causes switch I to move away from the nucleotidebinding
site, or as observed in the switch I open conformations of
kinesin (Fig. 3). In either case, switch I rearrangements would
not only disrupt coordination of the P
i
, but would also open up an
exit route. It should be noted that ADP would remain bound
because of interactions with the P-loop and switch II, as observed
in many kinesin crystal structures, and P
i
release via the switch I

prior to ATP hydrolysis that result in a closed, hydrolysis-competent state. Switch I (SwI) in the closed conformation encloses the c-phosphate of the bound
nucleotide, forming a ‘P
i
tube’ in the motors (Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006; Sindelar and Downing, 2010) (top). Following ATP hydrolysis, switch I undergoes
movements that disrupt the P
i
tube and open the active site, providing a pathway for release of P
i
(bottom). This pathway differs from the ‘back door’ opening in
the active site that has been proposed to provide an exit route for P
i
release (Yount et al., 1995; Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010; Llinas et al., 2012),
but is now considered unlikely (Lawson et al., 2004; Kaliman et al., 2009). Formation of a P
i
tube by switch I appears to facilitate ATP hydrolysis and also helps
explain the essential role of switch I in the catalytic cycle. The structures were aligned by the P-loops; bound ATP-like nucleotide (AMP?PNP for Eg5 and

opening would not necessarily be directly coupled to release of
ADP.
Finally, it is interesting to note that the similarities between
kinesins and myosins extend beyond the realm of motor domains
that are related by divergent evolution, as it appears that kinesin
and myosin subfamilies have used similar approaches to solve
problems associated with being nonprocessive or processive. It
has been known for many years that conventional myosin II
motors, such as the myosin powering muscle contraction,
produce force by rotation of a rigid lever arm (Fig. 2,
supplementary material Movie 3). In the case of myosin II, the
lever arm extends out of the converter domain, which is, in turn,
involved in tight hydrophobic contacts with the helical lever arm.
As described above, movement of switch II is linked to a
movement of the relay helix, which leads to a rigid body
movement of the converter domain and lever arm, resulting in the
force-generating power stroke of myosin. Similarly, in the
kinesin-14 motor Ncd, movement of helix a4 appears to lead to
a large rotation of the Ncd helical neck and stalk, very similar to
the myosin power stroke (Fig. 2, supplementary material Movie
2). Interestingly, both myosin II and Ncd are nonprocessive
motors; however, myosin V, a processive motor, is thought to
move along actin utilizing an extended lever arm with a
mechanism similar to that of myosin II. By contrast,
conventional dimeric kinesin-1 motors move processively
(Howard et al., 1989; Block et al., 1990), taking multiple steps
along a microtubule protofilament (Ray et al., 1993; Schaap et al.,
2011) utilizing a different mechanism. This hand-over-hand
movement is achieved by the sequential docking and undocking
of a flexible ‘neck linker’ that connects the motor domain to the
coiled-coil stalk (Kozielski et al., 1997; Rice et al., 1999) (Fig. 2,
supplementary material Movie 1). The neck linker extends in
length to allow both heads of the dimeric motor to bind
simultaneously to the microtubule and produce force, acting
together with the ‘cover strand’ (Hwang et al., 2008; Khalil et al.,
2008) (Box 1). It has been suggested that strain between the
heads, transmitted though the neck linkers, coordinates the
mechanochemical cycles of the two heads (see Clancy et al.,
2011). Recent studies on myosin VI, a dimeric processive myosin
motor, point to a similar mechanism involving the unfolding of
an insertion between the converter domain and lever arm.
Regions of compliance in the lever arm and insertion regions that
are unique to myosin VI allow the motor to walk processively in
a manner similar to that of the kinesin ‘neck-linker’ mechanism
(Me ´ne ´trey et al., 2012) with the two heads stepping along actinbinding
sites and taking highly variable steps averaging 30–
36 nm and up to 65 A ˚ apart (Rock et al., 2001). It is therefore
doubly remarkable that kinesin and myosin motor proteins
evolved divergently from a common ancestor, but then appear to
have convergently evolved a similar set of strategies that are
employed in various ways to achieve processive versus nonprocessive
movement along their respective filaments.
Inhibitors and activators of the
mechanochemical cycle – insights into motor
function
Kinesin inhibitors
An early realization in the motors field was that the kinesins,
because of their essential roles in mitosis, might serve as
effective targets for drugs against cancer (Mayer et al., 1999).
Small molecules that bind to specific kinesin proteins could
disrupt motor function and block cell division during tumor
formation or metastasis. These compounds offer potential
advantages over currently used antimitotic drugs, many of
which target microtubules, in that they are expected to be
specific to dividing cells, rather than affecting all cells – they
could thus reduce the side effects caused by known microtubule
drugs due to the disruption of other microtubule-based processes.
Compounds specific for given kinesin motors are also potentially
useful in unraveling the motor force-producing mechanism in
live cells.
The first small-molecule inhibitor to be reported that targeted a
kinesin was monastrol, a compound discovered in a chemical
genetics screen for inhibitors of mitosis (Mayer et al., 1999). A
screen for cell-permeable compounds that affected mitosis
identified five that were found to have effects on mitosis but
not on microtubules. Their effects thus differed from taxol, a
widely used anti-cancer drug that affects microtubules in all cells,
including those in mitosis. Monastrol, one of the five compounds,
was especially interesting because of its striking effects on
dividing cells – the cells were arrested in mitosis with a ring-like
array of mitotic chromosomes attached to a monoastral spindle
(Mayer et al., 1999). These cellular effects are remarkably similar
to the mutant phenotype of the kinesin-5 BimC protein (Enos and
Morris, 1990) and led the authors to test the effects of monastrol
on kinesin motors. Tests of monastrol on the kinesin-5 Eg5
vertebrate homologue KSP showed that the compound
specifically blocks kinesin-5 motility in vitro, but does not
inhibit kinesin-1 motility (Mayer et al., 1999). The specificity of
monastrol for vertebrate kinesin-5 motors has been further
demonstrated by others (DeBonis et al., 2003).
Kinetic studies showed that monastrol binds to the kinesin-5
motor domain and inhibits its ATPase activity but does not
compete with nucleotide or microtubule binding (Maliga et al.,
2002; DeBonis et al., 2003). The effects of monastrol on kinesin-
5 became clearer with the report of a crystal structure of human
kinesin-5 Eg5 complexed with monastrol (PDB 1Q0B) that
revealed the compound bound to a newly formed site near the
nucleotide-binding cleft (Yan et al., 2004) (Fig. 4). This
‘induced-fit’ pocket is formed by the restructuring of loop L5
just below the active site. Remarkably, the new conformation of
L5 resembles the loop in the ATP-like state, as noted in
superpositions (Fig. 4). Thus, binding by monastrol restructures
loop L5, stabilizing the loop in the ATP-like state. Although it
can still be referred to as induced fit, it does not involve the
formation of a new fold in the motor. Binding by monastrol also
induces changes in the motor distal to the binding site, including
a loop-to-helix transition in switch I, tilting of switch II helices
a4 and a5, and docking of the neck linker against the motor
(Fig. 4). These latter changes in switch II and the neck linker are
also observed in kinesin motors bound to ATP analogues
(Kikkawa et al., 2001; Parke et al., 2010), and are thought to
be characteristic of the ATP state of the kinesins. The two
available crystal structures (PDB 1Q0B and 1X88) both show
Eg5 bound to monastrol and ADP, trapped in a conformation that
resembles an ATP-like, force-producing state. Because of its
effects in slowing ATP hydrolysis, monastrol inhibits motility,
reducing crosslinking and sliding of spindle microtubules in
dividing cells.
The discovery of monastrol was a game-changer for
antimitotic cancer therapeutics – it shifted the target of new
screens from microtubules to specific kinesin motors. With the

excitement accompanying the discovery of a small-molecule
inhibitor specific for kinesin-5 came the realization that the
inhibitory activity of monastrol was too weak for it to be effective
clinically, although it was still a potentially important reagent for
use in clarifying the role of kinesin-5 in the spindle (Kapoor et al.,
2000). This recognition led to the search for more potent secondgeneration
kinesin inhibitors, and their discovery and
characterization. One of the most promising of the new smallmolecule
inhibitors is ispinesib, which was discovered in a screen
for inhibitors of human kinesin-5 Eg5 ATPase activity (Lad et al.,
2008). Despite its structural differences compared with
monastrol, the effects of the two compounds on Eg5 are
remarkably similar – both bind specifically to Eg5 by induced
fit (Lad et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Talapatra et al., 2012),
stabilizing L5 in an ATP-like conformation, and both inhibit
ADP release and motility (Maliga et al., 2002; Lad et al., 2008)
(Box 2). Ispinesib is more potent than monastrol and is currently
being evaluated in phase II clinical trials for its effectiveness in
improving the outcome of different cancers (see http://
clinicaltrials.gov). Current success in identifying kinesin-5
inhibitors on the basis of structures of ispinesib and related
compounds is already spurring the search for further inhibitors to
circumvent the threat of resistance, which could potentially limit
their clinical use.
Other kinesin motors have also been targeted to identify new
inhibitors. Among them is kinesin-7 CENP-E, a kinetochore
motor that is thought to silence a mitotic checkpoint protein to
permit progression into anaphase (Mao et al., 2005). Loss of
CENP-E function causes prolonged mitotic delay, during which
chromosomes are clustered at either pole of the intact bipolar

Fig. 4. Monastrol inhibition of kinesin-5. (A) Crystal structures of kinesin-5 Eg5–ADP–monastrol (PDB 1Q0B, 1X88) show monastrol bound to a new site near
the nucleotide-binding cleft, formed by restructuring loop L5. L5 is highly mobile without monastrol, but less flexible when monastrol is bound. Superpositions
show that L5 of Eg5–ADP–monastrol (white or green, PDB 1Q0B) resembles L5 of Eg5 bound to the ATP analogue, AMP?PNP (light or medium blue, PDB
3HQD), rather than Eg5–ADP (light or dark purple, PDB 1II6) (see enlarged view below A). (B) The structural changes in Eg5–ADP–monastrol follow a pathway
from L5 to the adjacent helix a3 and then L8 [(A) and (B), green arrow]. Along this pathway, Eg5–ADP–monastrol follows Eg5–AMP?PNP somewhat more
closely than Eg5–ADP. Loop L8 contributes to microtubule binding by the motor and is adjacent to the major microtubule-binding complex L11-a4-L12-a5, and
also assumes an ATP-like conformation. Eg5–ADP–monastrol helices a4 and a5 are tilted, resembling the helices in the ATP-like state, although helix a4is
shorter than Eg5–AMP?PNP by three turns, which might explain the weak microtubule binding by the motor bound to monastrol, compared with Eg5 in the ATP-
like state. Tilting of a4 and a5 forms an opening that allows the neck linker (NL) to dock; the motors with a docked neck linker are interpreted to represent the
force-producing ATP state (Kikkawa et al., 2001; Parke et al., 2010). (C) Despite the resemblance of L5, L8,a4,a5 and the neck linker of Eg5–ADP–monastrol to
the ATP-like state, switch I of the motor has undergone a short loop-to-helix transition, which causes it to more closely resemble Eg5-ADP than Eg5–ATP. This is
also true of the central b-sheet, indicating that the twisting of the b-sheet that is predicted to promote ADP release by the kinesins has not taken place. This is
consistent with the effects of monastrol in inhibiting ADP release, and slowing or blocking the ATP hydrolysis cycle (Maliga et al., 2002; Cochran et al., 2005).
The structural effects of monastrol on switch I could also inhibit the formation of a switch I closed conformation (Box 1), which is thought to be essential for ATP
hydrolysis. The structural changes induced by monastrol thus cause the motor, still bound to ADP and inhibited in ATPase activity, to assume a conformation that
resembles a force-producing ATP-bound state. Superposition of the protein chains was performed using Matchmaker of Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and
default parameters by designating Eg5–ADP–monastrol as the reference chain and first aligning Eg5–ADP, then Eg5–AMP?PNP. The structures were displayed
and analyzed in Chimera.

spindle after failing to congress to the metaphase plate (Schaar
et al., 1997; McEwen et al., 2001). A screen of an organic
compound library for inhibitors of CENP-E microtubulestimulated
ATPase activity identified GSK923295 (Wood et al.,
2010). Tests showed that the effects of GSK923295 were highly
specific to CENP-E. Assays of GSK923295 on vertebrate
cultured cells showed delayed mitosis with failure of
metaphase chromosome alignment, similar to the effects
observed previously for loss of CENP-E function.
The site of GSK923295 binding to CENP-E has been mapped to a
site adjacent to loop L5 near the active site (Box 2). Remarkably,
this site is analogous to the site of monastrol and ispinesib binding to
kinesin-5 Eg5 and might involve restructuring of L5, as is the case
for the other two small molecules. Despite the fact that the three
compounds bind to a highly similar site on the two motors, their
kinetic effects on the motors are different, probably because of
differences in their structural effects on motor microtubule-binding
elements. Further attempts to obtain a crystal structure of CENP-E
complexed with GSK923295 (Wood et al., 2010) could reveal the
mechanism of motor inhibition by the compound; it could also
potentially provide valuable information about one of the missing
states in the kinesin cycle – the no-nucleotide, or possibly the
ADP?P
i
state.
The discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of the kinesin
motors have thus contributed to our knowledge of their
mechanism of function and might also play have an important
clinical role in improving the outcome for patients with tumors or
malignancies, particularly those resistant to currently used
microtubule drugs, such as taxol.
Myosin activator
Small-molecule screens have also been performed on the
myosins; however, in contrast to those performed on the
kinesins, one of the screens was designed to identify
compounds that activate rather than inhibit a specific myosin
motor. A small-molecule activator specific for cardiac myosin II
was discovered in a high-throughput screen for compounds that
activate cardiac myosin in a reconstituted sarcomere or myofibril
assay (Morgan et al., 2010). Tests of the optimized compound,
omecamtiv mecarbil, showed that it accelerates P
i
release and
ATP hydrolysis by cardiac myosin in the presence of actin, but
slows P
i
release and ATP hydrolysis in its absence (Malik et al.,
2011). P
i
release by myosin occurs at the transition between the
Box 2. Kinesin inhibition by small molecules
Kinesin-5 inhibition by ispinesib
Like monastrol (Cochran et al., 2005), ispinesib inhibits ADP
release by kinesin-5 and slows motor binding to microtubules (Lad
et al., 2008). Crystal structures show ispinesib bound to Eg5–ADP
at the same induced-fit cleft near loop L5 as monastrol (Zhang et
al., 2008; Talapatra et al., 2012). Superpositions show that L5 and
L8, the tilted switch II helices a4 and a5, and the docked neck
linker of Eg5–ADP–ispinesib are in the ATP-like conformation,
resembling Eg5–ADP–monastrol. Thus, both monastrol and
ispinesib induce structural changes in kinesin-5 at the site of
binding that are propagated to the microtubule-binding interface,
allowing the neck linker to dock. At the same time, the switch I
helix of Eg5 bound to either monastrol or ispinesib is slightly
extended and remains in an ADP-like conformation, which might
prevent its helix-to-loop transition into the closed conformation
thought to be essential for ATP hydrolysis. The central b-sheet
shows a somewhat closer resemblance to Eg5–ADP than Eg5–
AMP?PNP, suggesting that the predicted twisting of the b-sheet is
not induced by binding to either compound, inhibiting the release
of ADP.
Kinesin-7 inhibition by GSK923295
The binding site of the kinesin-7 CENP-E inhibitor, GSK923295,
has been mapped by photo-affinity labeling and mutational
analysis to a site between helices a2 and a3, adjacent to L5,
near the nucleotide-binding cleft, a site that corresponds to the
monastrol and ispinesib binding site (Wood et al., 2010).
GSK923295 inhibits P
i
production or release, consistent with a
block in ATP hydrolysis, and slows microtubule-stimulated ADP
release. CENP-E bound to GSK923295 binds tightly to
microtubules, even in the presence of ADP, which is normally
the weak binding state of the motor (Wood et al., 2010). This
differs from the effect by monastrol of causing Eg5 to bind weakly
to microtubules in the presence of ADP (Cochran et al., 2005).
Overall, GSK923295 slows or blocks ATP hydrolysis by CENP-E
and traps the motor in a tight microtubule-binding state, in contrast
to the weak microtubule-binding state induced by monastrol. The
motor might be locked in the no-nucleotide state, or possibly the
ADP?P
i
state, caused by the structural effects of the compound on
the motor. Thus, GSK923295 binds by induced fit to a site
corresponding to that of monastrol, yet the two inhibitors have
different effects on the motor when bound.
Box 3. Motors with increased mechanical output
Mechanical output by a motor can be increased in the following
ways:
Increased number of strokes per unit time
N An increase in the rate of P
i
release, which triggers the myosin
power stroke, is predicted to result in an increased rate of ATP
hydrolysis and the number of strokes per unit time by myosin.
This was found for cardiac myosin bound to omecamtiv
mecarbil (Malik et al., 2011). A crystal structure of myosin
complexed with omecamtiv mecarbil is not yet available, but
should shed light on the mechanism by which the compound
increases the rate of P
i
release by the motor.
N An increase in the rate of ADP release, usually the rate-limiting
step in the kinesin cycle, is expected to increase ATP hydrolysis
rates and the number of strokes/unit time for kinesin. Kinesin-14
Ncd mutants that affect a conserved residue in a loop of the
central b-sheet have recently been reported that increase ADP
release and ATPase rates by the motor, resulting in faster
microtubule gliding in motility assays and strikingly elongated
spindles in vivo (Liu et al., 2012).
Increased distance per stroke
N An increase in the length of the myosin lever arm or kinesin
stalk increases the gliding velocity of the motors (Stewart et al.,
1993; Chandra et al., 1993; Uyeda et al., 1996; Yun et al., 2003;
Endres et al., 2006); this has been inferred to increase the force
produced per motor, although increased force per motor has not
been directly demonstrated by single-molecule assays.
N An increase in the angle of lever arm or stalk rotation is
expected to increase the step size (Hallen et al., 2011; Me ´ne ´trey
et al., 2012) and the force produced per motor.
N Mutants that alter the free energy of motor binding to nucleotide
or its filament could increase the distance per motor stroke; such
mutants have not yet been reported.

weak and strong actin-binding state (Fig. 1). It is thought to be
required for myosin to enter the strongly bound state, which is
accompanied by rotation of the lever arm – the force-generating
stroke of the motor (Rayment et al., 1993). The overall effect of
omecamtiv mecarbil on cardiac myosin is predicted to be an
increase in the number of myosin heads interacting with actin in a
strong binding state and producing force, thus it is expected to
increase mechanical output by the motor (Box 3). The binding
site for omecamtiv mecarbil was mapped using a derivative as an
affinity label and identifying labeled cardiac myosin peptides by
mass spectrometry, and was found to be near the base of the lever
arm, close to the relay helix and converter. Further study of the
effects of residue changes in this region could lead to new
information regarding the myosin force-generating mechanism –
mutational changes that increase myosin mechanical output, such
as those reported recently for kinesin-14 Ncd (Liu et al., 2012)
(Box 3), would have important implications for understanding the
motor mechanism and also for potential clinical applications.
Consistent with its proposed effect in increasing mechanical
output by cardiac muscle, functional studies showed that
omecamtiv mecarbil increases the contractility of rat
cardiomyocytes and improves cardiac function in dogs with
induced heart failure (Malik et al., 2011). This is noteworthy,
given that it is easier to disrupt motor function than to increase it,
although ‘improved’ motors could potentially be produced in a
number of different ways (Box 3). These findings have potential
for therapeutic intervention in humans with heart disease or
failure. Recent reports of initial clinical trials in humans show
that omecamtiv mecarbil improves cardiac function in patients
with cardiac dysfunction or failure (Teerlink et al., 2011; Cleland
et al., 2011).
The properties of omecamtiv mecarbil provide a striking
confirmation of important differences between the myosins and
kinesins. For the myosins, the force-producing cycle is triggered
by P
i
release, which results in tight actin binding and the power
stroke, followed by ATP binding, which releases the motor from
actin. For the kinesins, the cycle begins with ADP release, which
results in tight microtubule binding, followed by ATP binding,
which triggers the force-producing stroke of the motor, Pi
release
and release of the motor from the microtubule.
Conclusions and Perspectives
Future progress in understanding the kinesin and myosin forcegenerating
mechanism is likely to come from further structural
analysis that defines the features of the tight, no-nucleotide
microtubule-bound state of the kinesins and the weak, ADP?P
i
actin-bound state of the myosins. The structural changes between
these states compared with the ATP-bound kinesin state and the
rigor myosin state, respectively, are expected to provide currently
missing information regarding key conformational changes that
are involved in force production by the motors. New structural
information, especially for kinesins with their much smaller
motor domain, could come from high-resolution cryo-electron
microscopy, which has currently reached resolutions of 8–10 A ˚
(Hirose et al., 2006; Kikkawa and Hirokawa, 2006; Sindelar and
Downing, 2010). These projected studies, together with the
characterization of mutant proteins to obtain information relevant
to function, should resolve currently outstanding issues, such as
the escape route of free Pi
from the motor after ATP hydrolysis,
and whether the central b-sheet of kinesins distorts or twists in
the same way as in myosins, and produce a more detailed
understanding of force generation by the kinesin and myosin
motors. This information will be of vital interest for comparison
with dyneins, for which unraveling the force-producing
mechanism is at a much earlier stage. The dynein motors differ
substantially from kinesins and myosins in overall structure –
their force-generating mechanism is anticipated to show
unexpected differences that will lend further insight into energy
transduction by ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes.
