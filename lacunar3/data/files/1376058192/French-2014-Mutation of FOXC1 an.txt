Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, whose prevalence
increases dramatically with age. Despite its substantial 
heritable basis, only a small number of causative genes have 
so far been identified, generally for severe early-onset pheno -
types (cerebral autosomal dominant or recessive arteriopathy 
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy: CADASIL 
[NOTCH3], CARASIL [HTRA1], and porencephaly [COL4A1]) 
(1–3). Such cases have revealed important pathways that contribute
to stroke, including the roles of Notch and TGF-β signaling. 
In the same way, the vascular basement membrane’s contribution
(COL4A1 and COL4A2) (3, 4) to juvenile stroke phenotypes 
further stimulated investigation of the cellular components 
(endothelial and mural cells) upon which brain vascular integrity
depends. The demonstration that Notch signaling regulates
pericyte numbers (5, 6) has in turn provided a mechanistic 
explanation for disorders such as CADASIL. These examples of 
juvenile stroke resulting from severe alterations in brain vascular 
development raise the intriguing possibility that milder changes 
contribute to late-onset disease and that a larger proportion of 
strokes have embryonic origins. It is therefore notable that the 
same genes regulate cerebral structural development and angiogenesis
(7) and that the cell populations essential for cerebral 
vascular homeostasis (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle) 
are predominantly derived from the neural crest (8, 9).
The increasing prevalence of stroke exerts disproportionately 
severe effects on the quality of life of affected individuals and their 
families. Consequently, phenotypes predictive of future stroke 
merit investigation, with the goal of developing treatments targeting
causative pathways and preventing a frequently preterminal
disease. One such phenotype is cerebral small-vessel disease 
(CSVD), which represents a major risk factor for both ischemic 
and hemorrhagic stroke (10–13). Characterized by perturbed perforating
end-artery function, CSVD results in lesions apparent 
on MRI that encompass white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), 
dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and lacunar infarcts. 
These markers of cerebrovascular pathology provide opportunities
for gene discovery and for defining the mechanisms that contribute
to subsequent stroke.
Our study evaluated the hypothesis that the forkhead box 
transcription factor FOXC1, which patterns multiple organs 
including the CNS, contributes to CSVD. It was prompted by a 
higher incidence of self-reported stroke in some of our local pedigrees
with FOXC1 mutations and supported experimentally by: 
(a) blood-stained hydrocephalus in murine Foxc1–/– mutants, (b) 
related zebrafish foxc1 morphant phenotypes, and (c) the exten-
Patients with cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) exhibit perturbed end-artery function and have an increased risk for stroke 
and age-related cognitive decline. Here, we used targeted genome-wide association (GWA) analysis and defined a CSVD locus 
adjacent to the forkhead transcription factor FOXC1. Moreover, we determined that the linked SNPs influence FOXC1 transcript 
levels and demonstrated that patients as young as 1 year of age with altered FOXC1 function exhibit CSVD. MRI analysis of 
patients with missense and nonsense mutations as well as FOXC1-encompassing segmental duplication and deletion revealed 
white matter hyperintensities, dilated perivascular spaces, and lacunar infarction. In a zebrafish model, overexpression or 
morpholino-induced suppression of foxc1 induced cerebral hemorrhage. Inhibition of foxc1 perturbed platelet-derived growth 
factor (Pdgf) signaling, impairing neural crest migration and the recruitment of mural cells, which are essential for vascular 
stability. GWA analysis also linked the FOXC1-interacting transcription factor PITX2 to CSVD, and both patients with PITX2
mutations and murine Pitx2–/– mutants displayed brain vascular phenotypes. Together, these results extend the genetic 
etiology of stroke and demonstrate an increasing developmental basis for human cerebrovascular disease.

Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. This identified 
10 WMH-associated SNPs (P = 0.0031–0.048, Bonferroni-corrected
) located in an intron of GMDS, which catalyzes GDP-mannose
metabolism and lies adjacent to FOXC1 (Figure 1A and Supplemental
Table 1; supplemental material available online with 
this article; doi:10.1172/JCI75109DS1). Analysis of 2 independent 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets (19, 20) demonstrated
that 3 of these WMH-associated SNPs strongly influence 
FOXC1 transcript levels (study 1: P = 2.96 × 10–8–5.82 × 10–11; study 
2: P = 0.01–0.008; Supplemental Table 1).
We next assessed whether patients with FOXC1-attributable 
ARS exhibited CSVD. Eighteen patients with either a FOXC1 
mutation or copy number variation (CNV) (comprising missense 
sive involvement of Foxc1 in vascular development (14–16). The 
latter encompasses essential roles in arterial specification, angio -
genesis regulation, endothelial lymphatic cell sprouting (17), as 
well as a requirement for Foxc1 in brain pericytes (18). Here, we 
demonstrate  a role for FOXC1 in cerebrovascular disease through 
targeted genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, MRI of glaucoma
patients with FOXC1-attributable Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome
(ARS), and detailed zebrafish analyses.
Results and Discussion
We first performed a meta-analysis of GWA data for 500 kb 
encompassing FOXC1 on 6p25 in 9,361 individuals with brain 
MRI data from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in

pathway in foxc1 morphants. We observed reduced expression of 
both receptor tyrosine kinases (pdgfra and pdgfrb) in foxc1 morphants
(Figure 2, A–H), positioning Pdgf signaling genetically 
downstream of Foxc1. Importantly, the prevalence of cerebral 
hemorrhage induced by morpholino inhibition of pdgfra alone, or 
pharmacological inhibition of pdgfra and pdgfrb, synergized with 
foxc1 morpholino inhibition (Figure 2, I–L). This is consistent with 
a model in which Foxc1 regulates vascular stability through the 
Pdgfrαα homodimer and Pdgfrαβ heterodimer, either by the control
of pdgfra and pdgfrb expression or indirectly as a consequence 
of aberrant neural crest migration and/or survival.
Since loss of neural crest–specific Pdgfra induces murine cerebral
hemorrhage and irregular vascular smooth muscle cell coverage
(25, 26), we predicted loss of such cells in foxc1 morphants. 
In keeping with the aberrant cerebral neural crest migration and 
increased cell death (Supplemental Figure 4), foxc1 morphants 
exhibited reduced numbers of neural crest cells associating with 
the cerebral vasculature at 32 hours post fertilization (hpf) (foxc1MO
1.6 ± 0.5, WT 2.2 ± 0.4; P = 0.0008) (Figure 3, A–C). Consistently, at 
4 days post fertilization (dpf), this manifested as reduced numbers 
of vascular smooth muscle cells (foxc1MO 48 ± 10, WT 61 ± 9; P = 0.01) 
(Figure 3, D–F). In contrast, we found that expression of markers for 
other vascular components (col4a1 and claudin5b) and endothelial 
cell numbers in both morphants and murine endothelial–specific 
Foxc1–/– mutants was unaltered (Supplemental Figure 5). Together, 
these data support a model of reduced neural crest–derived smooth 
[n = 4] or frameshift mutation [n = 3], segmental deletion [n = 5], 
or duplication [n = 6]) (Figure 1B) were recruited for cerebral MRI 
(Supplemental Table 2). All 18 displayed CSVD, including WMH, 
dilated perivascular spaces, and lacunar infarcts (Figure 1, C–H, 
Supplemental Figure 1, and Supplemental Table 2). These changes, 
present in patients as young as 1 year of age, reveal a developmental
component to CSVD. Cerebrovascular phenotypes were evident
with both 6p25 segmental duplication or deletion, demonstrating
that deviations from normal FOXC1 gene dosage result in 
similar anomalies, as previously observed with FOXC1-dependent 
cerebellar maldevelopment (21), corneal neovascularization (22), 
and ARS (23, 24). The 7 patients with coding mutations unambiguously
demonstrate that impaired FOXC1 function alone is sufficient
to induce CSVD.
Consistent with these data, overexpression of zebrafish foxc1a
or dual suppression of both paralogs (foxc1a and foxc1b) results in 
cerebral hemorrhage (overexpression 32 of 111 [28.8%], suppression
111 of 352 [31.5%]; Figure 1, I–K, and Supplemental Table 3). 
Notably, acellular perivascular spaces were evident on electron 
microscopy of foxc1 morpholino oligonucleotide–treated embryos 
(foxc1 morphants) (Supplemental Figure 2). Foxc1 was expressed 
in the neural crest, and in morphants, there was aberrant migration
of the cerebral neural crest from which most mural cells are 
derived (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Since platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF) signaling regulates neural crest recruitment
to the developing vasculature, we evaluated this candidate 
Figure 2. Foxc1 regulates Pdgf signaling. Transcripts for pdgfra (Pdgfrα) and pdgfrb (Pdgfrβ) were expressed in neural crest cells at 20 hpf (arrows) in WT 
embryos (A and C) and were highly downregulated in foxc1 morphants (B and D). At 48 hpf, expression of pdgfra was observed in major cerebral blood 
vessels and ventral head mesenchyme (E, arrow), with the latter being reduced in foxc1 morphants (F), whereas pdgfrb expression was unaltered (G and H). 
A genetic interaction was observed between subthreshold inhibition of foxc1 and pdgfra (I) or with treatments that affected both Pdgfrα and Pdgfrβ signaling
, including dual-morpholino suppression (K) and the pan-Pdgfr inhibitor crenolanib (L). No interaction was observed using subthreshold inhibition of 
foxc1 and pdgfrb alone (J). Scale bar: 200 μm.

(18), reveal the contribution from altered neural crest function 
and substantially increase the proportion of strokes known to have 
developmental origins. Furthermore, the evidence presented 
here from Foxc1 and Pitx2 implicates other transcription factors 
with neural crest roles as candidates and thus provides practical 
opportunities for accelerating the identification of the molecular 
basis for stroke through integrated human genetic and zebrafish 
analyses. Our observation of a predominantly mural role for Foxc1 
in the cerebral vasculature, which contrasts with an endothelial 
cell contribution systemically (16), also merits investigation and 
may correlate with the unique endothelial barrier properties of 
the cerebral circulation. From a clinical perspective, the substantial
interval that elapses between the onset of MRI-detectable 
features of CSVD and the occurrence of stroke provides a therapeutic
window for intervention, and potentially, patients with 
mutations involving neural crest genes may benefit from common 
stroke-prevention strategies. Finally, our findings have direct 
implications for Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a glaucoma subtype 
frequently associated with progressive visual decline despite surgical
control of intraocular pressure (30). Evidence of a cerebral 
vasculopathy raises the possibility that perturbed vascular function
contributes to the visual loss that has previously been attributed
to optic nerve disease.
muscle cell coverage, impairing vascular stability (27), as a key component
of foxc1 morphants’ hemorrhagic phenotype.
To test the hypothesis that other ocular developmental genes 
with neural crest roles contribute to CSVD, we analyzed regional 
GWA data for PITX2, a neural crest–expressed, ARS-causing 
transcription factor that physically interacts with FOXC1. PITX2
is associated with atrial fibrillation (28) and cardioembolic stroke 
(29), with the latter attributed to  cardiac arrhythmia. Nine SNPs 
within a 500-kb PITX2-encompassing interval were significantly 
associated with WMH (P = 0.0071–0.022, Bonferroni-corrected; 
Supplemental Table 4 and Supplemental Figure 6, and MRIs of 
young PITX2-attributable ARS patients revealed CSVD (Figure 3, 
G and H). Thus, PITX2 may increase stroke risk independently 
of atrial fibrillation. Consistent with such a primary alteration to 
cerebral vasculature, murine Pitx2–/– mutants exhibited reduced 
and discontinuous smooth muscle actin staining of cerebral vessels
(Figure 3, I and J) as well as increased cerebral vessel density 
(Pitx2–/– 12.2 ± 0.8, WT 9.3 ± 1.0; P = 0.04).
By demonstrating that aberrant FOXC1 function causes 
human cerebrovascular disease, this study extends the knowledge 
of disorders whose genetic etiology remains largely unexplained.

another laboratory’s detailed analysis of murine Foxc1 mutants

vasculature in WT embryos at 32 hpf (A) was significantly reduced in foxc1 morphants (B and C). Cerebral vascular mural cells expressed smooth muscle actin 
by 4 dpf (D), with fewer smooth muscle actin–positive cells observed in foxc1 morphants (E and F). Patients with PITX2-attributable ARS exhibited CSVD: 
(G) WMH, (arrows) and (H) dilated perivascular spaces (arrowheads). Compared with WT embryos (I), murine Pitx2–/– mutants demonstrated reduced and 
discontinuous smooth muscle actin staining of large and small cerebral vessels (J). Original magnification, ×200 (A and B), ×100 (D and E), and ×400 (I and J).
