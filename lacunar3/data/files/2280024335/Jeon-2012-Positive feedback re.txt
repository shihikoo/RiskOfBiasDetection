Abstract
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single genetic
cause of mental retardation and autistic spectrum disease,
occurs when FMR1 gene is mutated. FMR1 encodes fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) which regulates translation
of mRNAs playing important roles in the development of
neurons as well as formation and maintenance of synapses.
To examine whether FMRP regulates cell viability, we induced
apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons with glutamate
in vitro and with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
in striatal neurons in vivo. Both conditions elicited a rapid, but
transient FMRP expression in neurons. This up-regulated
FMRP expression was abolished by pre-treatment with PI3K
and Protein Kinase B (Akt) inhibitors: LY294002, Akt inhibitor
IV, and VIII. Reduced FMRP expression in vitro or in vivo
using small hairpin Fmr1 virus exacerbated cell death by
glutamate or MCAO, presumably via hypophosphorylation of
Akt and reduced expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large
(Bcl-xL). However, over-expression of FMRP using enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-FMRP constructs alleviated
cell death, increased Akt activity, and enhanced Bcl-xL production.
The pro-survival role of Akt-dependent up-regulation
of FMRP in glutamate-stimulated cultured neuron as well as in
ischemic brain may have a clinical importance in FXS as well
as in neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic brain injury.
Keywords: Akt, Bcl-xL, FMRP, glutamate, ischemia, neuronal
survival.

mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene expression is an established
cause of FXS (Krueger and Bear 2011). The expansion
of CGG repeats (> 200) in 5¢ untranslated regions of Fmr1
gene results in hypermethylation, transcriptional silencing,
and loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
(Chakrabarti and Davies 1997).
The Fmr1 gene encodes FMRP known to regulate
translation of brain mRNAs which are related to dendritic
growth (Darnell et al. 2001; Nimchinsky et al. 2001),
synapse formation (Darnell et al. 2001), and monoamine
synthesis (Berry-Kravis and Ciurlionis 1998). FMRP silencing
induces abnormal regulation of brain mRNA translation
(Brown et al. 2001; Napoli et al. 2008; Edbauer et al. 2010)
and a disruption in the composition of the appropriate protein
milieu, which mediates defects in neuronal development and
synaptogenesis (Bassell and Warren 2008).
FMRP function is thought to be mediated largely by its
ability to bind mRNAs through two well-known RNA-binding
domains, like K-homology domains, and RGG (arg-gly-gly
triplet) box (Siomi et al. 1993). Through these domains,
FMRP recognizes, regulates (mainly represses) translation,
and transports specific mRNAs (Brown et al. 2001; Zalfa
et al.2007; Bassell and Warren 2008; Dictenberget al.2008).
In neurons, FMRP may modulate expression of mRNAs by
controlling recognition, export, translational efficiency, and
stability of target mRNAs (Darnellet al.2001; De Rubeis and
Bagni 2010). Meanwhile, it is also known that FMRP has a
nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal
(Eberhart et al. 1996), suggesting that it shuttles between the
nucleus and cytoplasm. In fact, FMRP is found in both nucleus
and cytoplasm, an indication that it may have several
independent functions within the cell such as the regulation
of cell division, growth, and survival (Siomi et al. 1993).
Among the various mRNAs which might be regulated by
FMRP, some are related to the regulation of cell survival and
death. These include components of Bcl-2 family-like Bcl-2-
interacting protein (Bnip) and Bcl-2-interacting killer as well
as signaling molecules such as NF-kB, PKC, and Mitogenactivated
protein kinase (Brownet al.2001; Chenet al.2003).
Many studies have identified Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K)- Protein Kinase B (Akt) as a major cell
survival signaling pathway (Engelman et al. 2006; Chalhoub
et al. 2009; Wagner-Golbs and Luhmann 2012), which
makes the pathway an attractive target for therapeutics
against many forms of cancer with misregulated cellular
apoptosis (Vivanco and Sawyers 2002). Akt is a serine/
threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in multiple
cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
transcription (Datta et al. 1997). Among these various
functions, Akt indirectly activates NF-kB transactivation by
dissociation of phosphorylated Ik-B kinase, resulting in
transcription of pro-survival genes like B-cell lymphomaextra
large (Bcl-xL) and trophic factors (Brunet et al. 2001).
In addition, trophic events alleviate excitotoxic and ischemic
injury by activating PI3K-dependent Akt activation. Collectively
, Akt signaling pathway seems to be one of the major
mediators or determinants of cellular survival or death.
Interestingly, abnormal Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling cascades
were reported in Fmr1 knockout animals (Hu et al. 2008).
Although both Ras–MEK–ERK1/2 Mitogen-activated protein
kinase cascades and Ras-PI3K–Akt cascades were
normal in wild-type and Fmr1 knockout animals in basal
condition, the stimulation-induced activation of PI3K–Akt
was weakened and abnormal in Fmr1 knockout animals (Hu
et al. 2008). Interestingly, standardized incidence ratio of
cancer was reduced to 0.28 (95.0% ± 0.8) compared to
control in a study of Dutch FXS patients (Schultz-Pedersen
et al. 2001). These results suggest that down-regulation of
FMRP may increase cell death via abnormal Ras-PI3K-Akt
signaling in stimulated condition, which may misregulate
downstream targets such as Bcl-xL. In this study, we
hypothesized that FMRP may control cell survival and death
in neurons via the regulation PI3K-Akt pathway and
investigated the possibility using in vitro glutamate stimulation
and in vivo transient focal ischemia (middle cerebral
artery occlusion, MCAO) paradigm.

of Konkuk University and carried out in accordance with the
Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication No. 85–23
revised 1985) and the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of Konkuk
University, Korea.
Cell culture
Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from the cerebral
cortex of fetal SD rat at embryonic day 16 as previously reported
(Jeon et al. 2011a). Briefly, cortices were dissected, incubated in
trypsin-EDTA, and dissociated with a Pasteur pipette. The dissociated
cells were resuspended in B27-supplemented neurobasal
medium and plated onto poly-D-lysine-pre-coated culture dishes.
Cultured cortical neurons were kept for 10 days at 37C in 10%
CO2 environment before experiments.
In vitro cell treatments
For stimulation of cortical neurons, 50 lM glutamate was bath
applied in the culture media for different time points, PI3K inhibitor
(LY294002; 10 lM) and Akt inhibitors (IV, and VIII; final 10 lM)
were pre-treated for 1 h, respectively. Unless otherwise specified,
cells were harvested after 0.5-h glutamate treatment in most
experiments.
MCAO
Male Wistar rats were used for transient MCAO surgery under a
general anesthesia, as we previously reported with a slight
modification (Kim et al. 2011). In brief, silicon-coated nylon
monofilament was introduced into right middle cerebral artery for
1 h and induced occlusion. After occlusion, filaments were removed
allowing reperfusion of blood to the affected areas and lesions were
sealed. For PCR and western blot analysis, the rats were
anesthetized, decapitated and the striatum was dissected. For
immunohistochemical analysis, the rats were anesthetized with
ether and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA at 24 h post
ischemia. Brain samples were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and
equilibrated into 30% sucrose for three days prior to cryosectioning.
Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
Using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), total RNA was extracted from the
cell and converted to cDNA by Maxime RT PreMix Kit (iNtRON
Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea). For real-time PCR, total cDNAs were
diluted 1 : 10 in double-distilled water and Maxima SYBR Green/
ROX qPCR Master Mix (2X) (K0221, Fermentas). The primers for
FMRP (accession number NM_002024.4) and glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, accession number M17701)
used for amplification reactions are as follows:
for FMRP,
forward primer : 5¢-TTG GTA CCT TGC ACA CAT CA-3¢
reverse primer : 5¢-AAG TTA GCG CCT TGC TGA AT-3¢
for GAPDH,
forward primer : 5¢-TCC CTC AAG ATT GTC AGC AA-3¢
reverse primer : 5¢-AGA TCC ACA ACG GAT ACA TT-3¢
The PCR protocol was as follows: 95C for 30 s, 60C for 8 s,
72C for 15 s, and continued by a final step at 4C for 10 s. After all
the reactions were finished, data were compiled automatically by the
equipment (7500 Real-Time PCR Systems; Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results were circulated by comparative CT
method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001).
For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the amplification reaction was
performed using Maxime PCR premix Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology)
as previously reported (Jeon et al. 2011b). The expected, size of the
amplified DNA fragments was 486 base pairs for FMRP and 308
base pairs for GAPDH, respectively.
Western blot
After treatment, cultured cells were lysed with 2X sample buffer
(4% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 200 mM dithiothreitol
, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.02% bromophenol blue).
For in vivo experiments, rats were killed and briefly perfused with
ice-cold saline (pH 7.4). Brains were rapidly removed and dissected
to prefrontal cortex and striatum. Brain tissues were homogenized in
1 mL Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 62.5 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mM 2–
mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 lM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 lg/mL aprotinin, and 1 lg/mL leupeptin.
After centrifugation for 30 min at 4C, the concentration of protein
extracts were measured by using bicinchoninic acid protein assay. In
some cases, cultured cells were fractionated into nuclear and
cytoplasm fractions as previously reported with a slight modification
(Schreiber et al. 1990). In brief, cells were harvested with hypotonic
buffer [10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl
2
, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and protease
inhibitor stock III (535140, Calbiochem)] and centrifuged (7200 g,
5 min, 4C) to obtain cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was
resuspended with extraction buffer [10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH
7.9), 400 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, and protease
inhibitor stock III (535140, Calbiochem)] and incubated on ice for
an hour. Samples were then centrifuged 12 000 gfor 10 min, at 4C
and the supernatant was collected as nuclear fraction. After
preparation, samples were run through an 8–12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane and western blot analysis was performed as
described (Jeon et al. 2011b). Appropriate protein bands were
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Buckinghampshire
, UK).
Immunocytochemistry
Cortical neurons on poly-D-lysine pre-coated cover glasses (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and incubated at 4C overnight with an appropriate
primary antibodies such as NeuN {1 : 500 diluted in blocking
buffer [1% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal bovine serum
contained in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]}, FMRP (1 : 500
diluted in blocking buffer), p24 (1 : 500 diluted in blocking
buffer). Next day, samples were incubated with an appropriate
secondary antibody (TMRE or FITC conjugated, 1 : 500 diluted
in blocking buffer), then mounted using Vectashield (Vector
laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and visualized with a
confocal fluorescence microscope (TCS-SP; Leica, Heidelberg,
Germany). Each treatment was performed in triplicate and
assessment was performed on five regions of interest/coverslip
selected at random.
Immunohistochemistry
Rat brains were perfused with 4% PFA and were cryosectioned
using Cryocut microtome (CM-1850; Leica, McHenry, IL, USA) to
a thickness of 40 lm and incubated with specific primary antibodies

such as NeuN (1 : 500) and FMRP (1 : 500) in blocking buffer
overnight. After washing three times with PBS, samples were
incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody (1 : 500 diluted
with blocking buffer) at around 20C for 2 h. Samples were
mounted using Vectashield (Vector laboratories), dried another
24 h, and observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (TCSSP
; Leica).
Silencing of FMRP expression
shRNA virus were purchased as glycerol stocks (Sigma, SHGLY
TRCN0000059759) and prepared using maxi-prep kit (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA, USA). ShRNA vector, packaging vector (Sigma), and
FuGENE 6 (Roche) were mixed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation (Jeon et al. 2011b). The resulting shFmr1 virus
targets Fmr1 gene (NM_002024) and the sequence composed of
sense, loop, and antisense strands as follows:
CCGGGCGTTTGGAGAGATTACAAATCTCGAGATTTGTAA
TCTCTCCAAACGCTTTTT
As a control, non-target shRNA control vector with following
sequence was used (SHC002, Sigma):
CCGGCAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAACTCGAGTTGGTG
CTCTTCATCTTGTTGTTTTT
shRNA virus was used at 50 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for
transduction in primary cortical neurons in serum-free media for
48 h (Jeon et al. 2011b) and in vivo microinjection into rat striatum.
Briefly, anesthetized male rats were positioned in a Stoelting
stereotaxic apparatus (51639; Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL, USA)
and shRNA virus introduced into the striatum (+0.7 mm anteroposterior
, ± 2.1 mm mediolateral, )5.0 mm dorsoventral from bregma,
computed value according to brain MAPS) by microinjection using
10 lL Hamilton syringe. Either non-targeting shRNA virus (CV) or
shFmr1RNA virus (FV) was introduced into the right hemisphere of
striatum and PBS was introduced into left hemisphere of striatum as
a control (1.5 lL and 0.5 lL/min). The injected regions were sealed
and sterilized. Four days post injection, the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (1 h) and 24-h reperfusion was performed on the either
sham or shRNA virus-injected rats. For PCR and western blot
analysis, the rats were anesthetized by ether, and decapitated, and
the striatum was dissected. After dissociation, tissues were lysed
using Trizol (PCR) and sample buffer (Western), respectively. For
immunohistochemical analysis, the rats were anesthetized with ether
and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA. Brain samples were postfixed
in 4% PFA for 24 h and equilibrated into 30% sucrose for
3 days prior to cryosectioning.
Over-expression of FMRP
Cells were transfected with eGFP-empty or eGFP-FMRP expression
vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-minimal
essential medium for 6 h and recovered for additional 18 h as
suggested by the manufacturer with slight modification (Jeon et al.
2011b). Cells were treated with 50 lM glutamate for 30 min and
observed using a TCS-SP microscope (Leica) after propidium iodide
(PI) staining or harvested for the examination of cellular proteins by
western blot.
Cell viability measurement
MTT assay. Primary cortical neurons were treated for indicated
times and incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) dye (5 mg/mL) at 37C. After 30-min
incubation, cells were solubilized with dimethylsulfoxide and the
absorbance of the sample was read at 590 nm with a microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnylvale, CA, USA). Data were
expressed as the percentage (%) of control (untreated cells).
PI staining.After treatment, cultured cortical neurons were incubated
with PI (10 lg/mL, contained with 10 lg/mL RNase) for 5 min at
around 20C followed by fixation using ice-cold methanol for 0.5 h
at )20C and mounted. PI is a marker for cells that have lost their
membrane integrity and has been used to identify apoptotic cells
in vitro (Jeon et al. 2011b). PI-positive cells were counted in
five random fields per sample by an individual blind to condition.
TUNEL assay. After treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized
by pre-cooled ethanol : acetic acid (2 : 1) for 5 min at )20C as 
suggested by the manufacturer of the TUNEL assay kit (Millipore).
After washing, equilibration buffer was applied and incubated for
10 s at around 20C. Working strength TdT enzyme was added
immediately and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37C for 1 h.
The reaction was stopped for 10 min and samples were incubated
with anti-digoxigenin-conjugated rhodamine in a humidified chamber
for 0.5 h at around 20C. Specimens were mounted under a
glass coverslip and observed. TUNEL-positive cells were counted in
five random fields per sample by an individual blind to condition.
Annexin V cell death assay. Annexin V cell death analysis was
performed using a commercial kit (AN-1001; Phoenix Flow
Systems Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). After glutamate treatment,
cultured neurons were washed two times with cold PBS. Cells were
resuspended with 1X binding buffer and added with staining
reagents (Annexin V and PI: 5 lL, respectively) as recommended
by the manufacturer for 20 min at around 20C. After staining,
400 lL of binding buffer was added to each tube and samples were
measured using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD, San Jose,
CA, USA). Results were analyzed using FlowJo program (Tree Star
Inc, Ashland, OR, USA).
Statistics
Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM and analyzed for statistical
significance by using one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keul’s
post hoc test and a p-value < 0.01 was considered significant.
Results
Phosphorylation of Akt is a prerequisite in promoting cell
viability after glutamate stimulation via transient
induction of FMRP
To induce neuronal cell death, we treated cultured rat primary
cortical neuron with 50 lM glutamate (Dong et al. 2009).
Consistent with previous findings, glutamate induced phosphorylation
of both PI3K and Akt within 10 min (Fig. 1a) and
longer treatment induced neuronal death as determined by
Annexin V staining, MTT assay (Figure S1), TUNEL staining
(Fig. 3b), and PI staining (Figure S3). Level of cleaved
caspase 3, which is often associated with cell death, was also

increased by glutamate treatment (Fig. 1b). Surprisingly,
glutamate also induced a rapid induction of FMRP protein
that had a remarkably similar time-course to the activation
(phosphorylation) of PI3K and Akt (Fig. 1c). At 3 h post
glutamate treatment, cellular FMRP expression started to
gradually decrease until 24 h. Pre-treatment of the cells with
Akt inhibitor IV to block Akt activation resulted in a
concentration-dependent inhibition of the glutamate-induced

known for their cellular pro-survival role (Cantley 2002; Liu
et al. 2010), it was not surprising that Akt inhibitor IV pretreatment
also increased cell death following glutamate
treatment (Fig. 1e) and decreased the level of the pro-survival
protein Bcl-xL (Fig. 1f). These results suggest that Akt

Fig. 1 Glutamate-induced alteration of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) induction in rat cortical
neurons. Rat primary cortical neurons were treated with 50 lM glutamate
for indicated times (a–c) or for 30 min (d, f) and were harvested
for western blot analysis. For cell viability analysis in (e), cells were
treated with 50 lM glutamate for 3 h. (a) Treatment of cortical neurons
with 50 lM glutamate elicited a transient PI3K and Akt phosphorylation

phosphorylation is required for the induction of FMRP protein
and the regulation of neuronal survival following glutamate
treatment. Treatment of a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or
another Akt inhibitor, Akt inhibitor VIII, also inhibited
glutamate-induced expression of FMRP and Bcl-xL, and
increased cell death (Figure S2a–f). As a downstream target of
PI3K-Aktsignaling,weexaminedGlycogensynthasekinase-3
beta (GSK3-b) phosphorylation after glutamate treatment,
which is also known as a modulator of cell survival,
differentiation, and proliferation in neural system (Liang and
Slingerland 2003; Bhatet al.2004). Consistent with the role of
GSK3-b as a downstream target of Akt signaling pathway in
cellular survival system against neurological insult condition
suchasMCAO(delaTorreet al.2012;Yeet al.2012),GSK3-
b was phosphorylated by glutamate and treatment with Akt
inhibitors like Akt inhibitor IV and VIII inhibited glutamateinduced
GSK3-b phosphorylation (Figure S2g–i). These
results suggest that GSK3-b might be functional downstream
of Akt signaling pathway involved in the regulation of cell
survival response against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.
Induction of FMRP expression in striatum after
transient focal cerebral ischemia
Brain injury, resulting in neuronal loss, was induced in male
Wistar rats by MCAO. Fmr1 mRNA expression was
measured by real-time PCR 1 h post reperfusion in striatum,
an area directly impacted by the occlusion (Fig. 2a). Fmr1
mRNA levels spiked at 1 h (Fig. 2a), as did FMRP protein
expression (Fig. 2b). This type of expression profile was not
detected for other cellular proteins including b-actin, a-
CaMKII, and histone H3 (Fig. 2b). Although the increase in
FMRP protein was detected in both the cytosolic and nuclear
fractions, the increase was more prominent in the nuclear
fraction (Fig. 2b). Similar modest increase of FMRP in
cytosolic compartments (Fig. 2c and d, arrow head) and
larger increase in nuclear compartments (Fig. 2c and d,
arrow) was also observed in histological examination of
striatal tissues after MCAO. When we analyzed histology
samples using Image J program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/,
NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), the increase in immunostaining
intensity in MCAO brain was 409.0 ± 28.1% (n =3,
p < 0.01) as compared with control. In our immunohistochemistry
data, not all neurons expressed FMRP. Although
most of the neurons in striatum expressed FMRP, there was a
small percentage of cells which did not express FMRP. The
nuclear localization of FMRP might suggest a role of FMRP
in mRNA processing such as binding, stability control, and
transport.
Inhibition of FMRP expression augmented neuronal
apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo
To investigate the role of FMRP in the regulation of cell
death, we modulated the level of cellular FMRP using
shRNA virus. After Fmr1 small hairpin lentiviral infection
(Fmr1 virus, FV), the expression of both Fmr1 mRNA and
FMRP was almost completely eliminated in rat primary
cortical neurons (Fig. 3a). In contrast, non-targeted shRNA
virus (control virus, CV) had no effect on either Fmr1
mRNA or FMRP expression level (Fig. 3a).
When we analyzed cell death using TUNEL staining, rat
primary cortical neurons expressing FV but not CV
showed increased basal and glutamate-induced cell death
(Fig. 3b). Similarly, the number of PI-positive cell (arrow
head) after glutamate treatment was increased by the loss
of FMRP in cortical neurons (Figure S3a). Importantly,
cells with high level of FMRP (arrow) was not usually PI
positive even after glutamate treatment (Figure S3a), cells
with no or low FMRP expression (arrow head) were
mostly PI positive. We also examined cell viability by
MTT assay after glutamate treatment (50 lM, 3 h).
Consistent with TUNEL and PI-staining experiments, FV
group (FMRP silenced) was more vulnerable to cell death
(Figure S3b). Altogether, these results suggest that FMRP
plays a protective role against glutamate-induced cell death
in cultured neurons.
To determine if the PI3K signaling pathway is affected by
FMRP knockdown, we next examined the status of PI3KAkt
phosphorylation and Bcl-xL expression in FV neurons.
In cultured neurons with reduced FMRP expression (FV), the
glutamate-induced activation of PI3K and Akt was reduced
compared to control (no virus con- nontreated samples- or
CV) (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, the expression of the prosurvival
protein Bcl-xL was also decreased in FV group
(Fig. 3d). In contrast, the level of pro-apoptotic cleaved
caspase 3 was increased in glutamate-treated FV group
compared with control or CV group (Fig. 3d).
In agreement with the in vitro experiments, stereotactic
injection of FV shRNA into rat striatum effectively silenced
FMRP expression (Fig. 3e). In striatal sections of CV
brains, there is abundant double labeling of FMRP and p24
core viral protein, (white filled arrows, Fig. 3e, middle
panel) suggesting that CV did not induce down-regulation
of FMRP. However, in Fmr1 shRNA injected striatum
(FV), numerous cells expressing p24 protein (green) were
without detectable FMRP expression (white empty arrows,
Fig. 3e right panel). There are cells still expressing
FMRP (red), but only in cells without viral expression
(green).
To confirm that knockdown of FMRP protein resulted in
an increase in cell death in vivo, we injected FV or CV into
the striatum prior to MCAO and analyzed apoptotic cell
death by TUNEL staining. We observed the number of
TUNEL-positive cells was higher in FV rats following
MCAO than that of CV-injected MCAO rats (Fig. 3f). These
results suggest that knockdown of FMRP expression
adversely affects cell survival presumably via decreased
Akt phosphorylation leading to the alterations in apoptotic
modulators such as Bcl-xL and caspase-3.

Over-expression of FMRP enhanced cellular survival
If knockdown of FMRP results in enhanced cell death, it is
reasonable assumption that over-expression of FMRP could
spare neurons from cell death following toxic stimuli.
Therefore, we next investigated the effect of over-expression
of FMRP on cell survival. Over-expression of FMRP was
confirmed by western blot (Fig. 4a). Rat primary cortical
neurons over-expressing eGFP-FMRP were less sensitive to

glutamate-induced cell death (Fig. 4b). Compared with
eGFP-FMRP-expressing cells, eGFP-expressing cells
showed 3.76 ± 1.12-fold more PI-positive cells, suggesting
that over-expression of FMRP protected cells from glutamate-induced
cell death. Consistent with the role of FMRP in
the PI3K pathway following a toxic stimulus, over-expression
of FMRP significantly increased the phosphorylation of
both PI3K and Akt (Fig. 4c). The level of Bcl-xL was also
significantly increased when FMRP was over-expressed,
again suggesting a protective role for FMRP in cell survival
(Fig. 4d).
Discussion
FMRP has been implicated in various neurological diseases
including FXS, autism, epilepsy, and attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. As such, research efforts have been focused
on understanding the function of FMRP during development
and the regulation of synaptic protein expression. However,
even in this relatively intensely studied field, the exact
regulatory mechanisms and functions of FMRP, especially in
the context of normal and stressed condition, have yet to be
fully elucidated.
In the work presented here, we described a pro-survival
function of FMRP in primary cortical neurons. Using lossand
gain- of functional analysis, we showed that FMRP
promoted cell survival under basal states and protects against
cell death following toxic stimuli. We employed two
common methods to induce neuronal stress, excessive
glutamate stimulation in vitro and ischemia in vivo. In both
cases, cell death was amplified in the absence of FMRP and
tempered following over-expression of FMRP.
After bath application of [(S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine
], which is a metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5
agonist, the level of FMRP was biphasically regulated by
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system and translational
control of FMRP as well as other regulator proteins (Hou
et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2011). Similar biphasic regulation of
FMRP level was also observed in our study, in this case with
initial increase of FMRP until 1 h, followed by downregulation
to basal level, although it remains to be determined
how it can be reconciled with the observed changes in
the activity of PI3K-Akt pathway. The rapid induction of

FMRP in our study may also suggest translational control
mechanism of FMRP expression at least in the early stage of
cellular stress. Actually, glutamate-induced rapid up-regulation
of FMRP in cultured primary neuron was not affected by
the pre-treatment of a transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin
D, however, the pre-treatment of a translational inhibitor
anisomycin significantly reduced FMRP expression in control
and glutamate-stimulated cells (our unpublished results).
Similarly, other researchers reported that mGluR-dependent
rapid FMRP expression is regulated by translational control
(Weiler et al. 1997; Narayanan et al. 2008), which might be
regulated by activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (Hou
and Klann 2004).
Previously, Khalil et al. showed a modest but significant
decrease in HeLa cell proliferation after Fmr1 siRNA-
induced knockdown of FMRP (Khalil et al. 2008) and we
reported a decrease in HeLa cell viability following Fmr1
siRNA in an etoposide-stimulated cell toxicity model (Jeon
et al. 2011b). Similarly, normal hippocampal neuronal
viability and development was reduced in Fmr1 knockout
mice compared with wild type (Jacobs and Doering 2010),
and neural stem cells from Fmr1 knockout mice showed
increased cell death (Castren et al. 2005; Castren 2006).
Taken together with our results, these data strongly implicate
an additional role of FMRP as a pro-survival protein.
Regarding the pro-survival role, the possible involvement
of FMRP in the Ras pathway was first described in
lymphocyte of FXS patients, which showed decreased
expression of Ras-GTPase-Activating protein SH3-domainbinding
protein, an effector of Ras signal transduction
pathway (Zhong et al. 1999). Ras-GTPase-Activating protein
SH3-domain-binding protein is expressed in brain (Atlas
et al. 2004) and affects proliferation, differentiation, and
survival of cell (Zhang and Shao 2010). Hu et al. reported
that Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling is muted in FMRP knockout
animals, suggesting the possibility that FMRP regulates Ras-
PI3K signaling pathway (Hu et al. 2008). FXS patients
showed lower cancer incidence compared with normal
subjects (Schultz-Pedersen et al. 2001), and it is speculated
that altered cell death regulatory mechanism, possibly via
misregulated Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling in FXS patients, might
underlie the lower cancer incidence (Hu et al. 2008).
In this study, FMRP expression was regulated by PI3K or
Akt activation. In turn, increased level of FMRP seems
essential for the up-regulation of Akt activity as evidenced by
shRNA and over-expression studies, which forms a positive
feedback loop. It is unclear how transient increase in FMRP
may lead to activation of PI3K in our condition. In Fmr1
knockout hippocampal CA1 cells, defective histamine or
acetylcholine-induced activation of PI3K-Akt pathway has
been reported, albeit with the increased basal Ras activity
(Hu et al. 2008). Interestingly, the basal level of Rasdependent
phosphorylation of Akt between WT and Fmr1
knockout mice was not different, which suggests that the
expression of FMRP might be important in the stimulusdependent
but not basal level of activation of PI3K, at least to
the downstream of Ras pathway (Hu et al. 2008). Similarly,
it has been reported that [(S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine]-
induced phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of
PI3K, such as phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1,
Akt, mTOR, and ribosomal p70S6 kinase, but not the basal
level of phosporylation is impaired in Fmr1 knockout mice
(Ronesi and Huber 2008), which may result from the reduced
mGluR-long Homer interaction in Fmr1 knockout mice.
Although other researchers reported up-regulation of PI3K
activity in Fmr1 knockout mice (Gross et al. 2010; Sharma
et al. 2010), these results may suggest a hypothesis that
transient increase in FMRP may increase stimulus-dependent
coupling of PI3K to upstream regulators by mechanisms
hitherto unknown. Recently, it was reported that PTEN, a
PI3K inhibitor and its mRNA is a putative target of FMRP,
was dephosphorylated in Fmr1 knockout mice, although it is
not sufficient to modulate PI3K activity (Sharmaet al.2010).
Whether transient induction of FMRP in our condition may
affect PTEN activity or expression to sufficient extent to
modulate PI3K activity remains to be determined. Another
candidate molecule which might be mediating the regulation
of PI3K-Akt pathway through FMRP is protein phosphatase
2A (PP2A). The mRNA for PP2A has been suggested as a
target of FMRP (Waggoner and Liebhaber 2003) and FMRP
inhibited the translation of PP2A to act as a negative
regulator of PP2A (Castets et al. 2005). Considering the role
of PP2A in the inhibitory regulation of Akt activity among
others (see a recent review by Bononi et al. 2011), it is also
possible that the changes in the level of FMRP in our
condition may exert its effects on PI3K-Akt pathway by
modulating the level and activity of PP2A, which again
needs experimental evidences in the future.
In contrast to our results, other researchers reported excess
PI3K activation in neurons from Fmr1 knockout mice (Gross
et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2010). At present, the reason
underlying those different results are not clear. Because we
used shRNA instead of cells derived from knockout animals,
the most evident difference would be the transient and acute
nature of the FMRP down-regulation in our condition as
compared with knockout animals. In situations where longterm
changes in FMRP expression happen (knockout mice
and human patients), compensatory responses may occur to
minimize the deleterious effects to cells. Second, although
the exact types of subpopulation of cells more vulnerable to
FMRP loss is not obvious from this study, susceptible cells
might be lost already in FMRP knockout mice during
development, which may make it difficult to observe massive
cell death in FMRP knockout mice. Investigating such cell
types, for example, neural progenitor cells in specified loci
and developmental stage, would be an interesting topic.
Recently, FMRP has been associated with the regulation
of cellular mitosis in neural stem cells. Luo et al. showed

almost 52.0% increase in Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (S
phase marker) positive neural stem/progenitor cells in Fmr1
knockout animals and suggested the mechanism by translational
control of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4
(CDK4) (Luo et al. 2010; Callan and Zarnescu 2011; Guo
et al. 2011), both of which are well-known partners of cell
cycle progression enhancers. In contrast to above results, our
results suggest that knockdown of FMRP in cultured neuron
decreases survival of neurons. The innate property of neuron
versus neural stem cell may explain the discrepancy. Unlike
to neural stem cell, the overt activation of cell cycle
progression in neuron, which is post-mitotic, has been
implicated in ectopic cell death in pathological conditions
including AD, PD, and stroke [for a review, see (Lopes and
Agostinho 2011)]. Neurological insults such as glutamate
excitotoxicity and stroke induce oxidative stress, which result
in overt activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and
CDK4 in neurons. CDK4 over-expression (activation) led
neurons to re-enter the cell cycle (from G1 to S and G2
phase). However, the re-entry into cell cycle does not reach
the M phase and initiates degenerative process (apoptosis) by
activating caspase 3 and pro-apoptotic factors of Bcl-2
(Lopes and Agostinho 2011). Therefore, the same molecular
events mediated by down-regulation of FMRP, i.e. overactivation
CDK5/4 may mediate mitosis in neural stem cell,
but susceptibility to cell death in neuron. Interestingly,
kinetic study of BrdU-positive cells in brain revealed that the
survival of BrdU-labeled cells over 4-weeks span was lower
in FMRP knockout mice suggesting that FMRP deficiency
might reduce cell survival of young neurons (Luo et al.
2010), which is consistent with our results. Taken together,
these results suggest that the loss of FMRP expression may
reduce cell survival of (young) neuron, although it may
induce cell proliferation of neural stem cells.
Even though the primary localization of FMRP is
cytoplasm in immunocytochemical staining or western blot
with biochemically fractionated samples (Devys et al. 1993;
Feng et al. 1997), it contains a functional, non-classical NLS
near its N terminus (Eberhart et al. 1996; Sittler et al. 1996;
Bardoni et al. 1997) with occasional nuclear localization
(Feng et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2009).
FMRP-GFP- or eGFP-FMRP-transfected cells showed
strong nuclear localization with bound mRNAs (De Diego
Otero et al. 2002) and shuttles between cytoplasm and
nucleus. In an experiment using a series of mutant with NLS
and nuclear export signal, it has been suggested that FMRP
primarily binds target mRNAs in nucleus although it is
effectively transported out by interaction with RNAs and
Tap/NXF1, a bulk mRNA exporter (Kim et al. 2009).
Silencing of Tap/NXF1 increased nuclear localization of
eGFP-FMRP (Kim et al. 2009). These results raise interesting
possibility that either retention of RNAs in the nucleus
or modulation of FMRP interacting proteins such as Tap/
NXF1 or nuclear FMRP-interacting protein 1 (Bardoni et al.
2003) may retain FMRP in nucleus. Recently, nuclear
retention and survival role of other RNA-binding proteins
has also been suggested. RNA-binding proteins, cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) 1, 3, and 4, are
accumulated in nucleus of neurons after treatment with
ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists in intracellular calcium
and alpha-CAMKII-dependent manner (Kan et al.
2010). Among those CPEB isotypes, CPEB4 has been
suggested to be important in cell survival during focal
ischemia in vivo and oxygen–glucose deprivation in vitro
(Kan et al. 2010). With these several intriguing possibilities
including the role of PI3K/Akt pathway in the regulation of
nuclear localization of FMRP in mind, we are actively
investigating the mechanism and role of nuclear FMRP
translocation in the regulation of neuronal survival.
In conclusion, our experimental results suggest that
physiological regulation of FMRP may enhance cellular
survival against neurotoxic stimulations such as ischemic
stroke. Investigating whether endogenous expression of
FMRP may perform neuroprotective roles against other
neurodegenerative disorders might provide a better understanding
and therapeutic targeting of these diseases.
