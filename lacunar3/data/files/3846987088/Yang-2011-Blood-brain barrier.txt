Blood–Brain Barrier Breakdown in Acute and Chronic
Cerebrovascular Disease
Yi Yang, MD, PhD; Gary A. Rosenberg, MD
Abstract—Disruptions of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and edema formation both play key roles in the development of
neurological dysfunction in acute and chronic cerebral ischemia. Animal studies have revealed the molecular cascades
that are initiated with hypoxia/ischemia in the cells forming the neurovascular unit and that contribute to cell death.
Matrix metalloproteinases cause reversible degradation of tight junction proteins early after the onset of ischemia,
and a delayed secondary opening during a neuroinflammatory response occurring from 24 to 72 hours after.
Cyclooxygenases are important in the delayed opening as the neuroinflammatory response progresses. An early
opening of the BBB within the 3-hour therapeutic window for tissue-type plasminogen activator can allow it to
enter the brain and increase the risk of hemorrhage. Chronic hypoxic hypoperfusion opens the BBB, which
contributes to the cognitive changes seen with lacunar strokes and white matter injury in subcortical ischemic
vascular disease. This review will describe the molecular and cellular events associated with BBB disruption and
potential therapies directed toward restoring the integrity of the neurovascular unit. (Stroke. 2011;42:3323-3328.)
Key Words: blood–brain barrier  brain ischemia  endothelium  ischemia  matrix proteins  neuroprotection
 vascular cognitive impairment  white matter disease
Molecular biology methods and advances in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) have provided novel insights
into the cerebral vasculature in acute and chronic stroke.
Protection of the neuronal microenvironment is provided by
the neuro(glio)vascular unit (NVU) that includes endothelial
cells, astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and extracellular matrix
around the vessels.1 Tight junction proteins form the first
defense in the endothelial barrier disruption that leads to
vasogenic edema and cell death. In stroke, the ischemic
injury induces a molecular cascade that culminates in the
formation of toxic proteases and free radicals, which participate
in damage to the tissue and the removal of dead cells. However,
the same molecules that are damaging in the early stages of the
injury perform essential functions in the recovery phase, drastically
complicating the therapeutic use of these agents. The
best-studied of these dual functioning molecules are the matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP), cyclooxygenases (COX), as well as
the free radicals, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species.
Biology of Tight Junctions and the NVU
Tight junction proteins form the initial barrier at the endothelial
cells between blood and brain cells. Major tight
junction proteins are occludin and claudins close to the blood,
and junctional adhesion molecules deeper in the endothelial
cell clefts.2 Surrounding the abluminal surface of the endothelial
cell is a basal lamina composed mainly of Type-IV
collagen, fibronectin, heparan sulfate, and laminin; laminin
functions as a charge and molecular weight barrier and
interacts in complex ways with integrins to regulate
permeability and cellular transport across the blood–brain
barrier (BBB).3 Embedded in the basal lamina are the
pericytes, which are hybrid cells with both macrophage
and smooth muscle properties.4 Astrocytes are generally
thought to be an essential cell for tight junction formation.
However, a recent study in embryos challenges this concept
by showing that BBB qualities of the capillary form
when endothelial cells invade the central nervous system
and pericytes are recruited to the developing vessels; this
occurs more than a week before astrocyte generation,
suggesting that pericytes are critical for tight junction
formation.5 Another interesting study of pericytes showed
that they decrease with age, paralleling an increase in BBB
permeability.6
Disruption of the BBB in Ischemia/Hypoxia
and Hemorrhage
Proteases, which are the final common pathway for disruption
of the NVU, are normally present in a latent form. Some
proteases are constitutively expressed and participate in
normal processes. This includes 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMPReceived

2), which is normally found in cerebrospinal fluid and in
astrocytes. Activation of the latent MMP-2 to the 62-to-64-
kDa forms requires the formation of a trimolecular complex
with MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-
2), and membrane-type 1 MMP, which confines activity of
MMP-2 to the vicinity of the membrane.
Another group of proteases are induced during an injury.
The major inducible MMPs are stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and
92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9). When these are released they
are unrestrained and act on multiple substrates in the extracellular
matrix (Figure 1). Cytokines induce the expression of
MMP-3 and MMP-9 through the action of nuclear-factor-B
and the activator protein-1 gene transcription sites. Another
source of MMPs is through the influx of white blood cells,
such as neutrophils, which can release activated 84-kDa
MMP-9. In reperfusion injury, proteases participate in the
biphasic opening of the BBB. An initial reversible phase
related to activation of latent MMP-2 precedes a later phase
at 24 to 48 hours associated with the induction of MMP-3 and
MMP-9 (Figure 2).
COX is another important family of inflammatory enzymes.
COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme, whereas COX-2 is
inducible and contributes to BBB damage as part of a
secondary inflammatory response from 24 to 72 hours after
the initial insult.7 Both MMP and COX-2 inhibitors protect
the BBB after an ischemic injury; MMP inhibitors act
during the early phase, and COX-2 inhibitors block the
secondary opening of the BBB, suggesting that a combination
of both agents may be able to control better the
disruption of the BBB.
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) breaks fibrin clots
and restores blood flow. In a small percentage of patients, tPA
leads to a life-threatening hemorrhage. Because the BBB is
disrupted early in the injury cascade, a possible mechanism of
bleeding is that tPA crosses the BBB. When tPA enters the
brain rather than remaining in circulation, it induces cytokines
and activates MMP-9.8 MMP inhibitors prevent early
opening of the BBB and can reduce risk of hemorrhage and
death when tPA is given in stroke.9 Low-density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein is a serine protease that is a member
of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family. Lowdensity
lipoprotein receptor-related protein binds tPA and
participates in the action of tPA.10,11
Aquaporins are pore-forming molecules that facilitate
the passage of water molecules across the BBB. Deletion
of AQP4 reduces edema in models in which cytotoxic
edema is the pathophysiological mechanism. However, in
conditions under which vasogenic edema is significant,
AQP4 deletion exacerbates brain edema, because AQP4
functions as a passive pore; it allows water to follow
pressure gradients to remove extracellular fluid and resolve
vasogenic edema.12
Oxidative stress damages endothelial cells of the BBB
and contributes to vasogenic edema. The superoxide radical
O

species involved in increased vascular permeability and
Figure 2. Schematic drawing to show theoretical mechanisms
leading to the initial reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) and later, the more slowly irreversible opening. Reperfusion
injury leads to a biphasic opening of the BBB. The early
opening occurs several hours after the onset of reperfusion
because of activation of the constitutive enzyme gelatinase A
(MMP-2). This initial opening is transient and reversible. At 24 to
72 hours later, the inflammatory response leads to the induction
of MMP-3 and MMP-9, which induce more intense and irreversible
damage to the blood vessel.
Figure 1. Mechanism for MMP-mediated
blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in hypoxia
/ischemia. Induction of hypoxia inducible
factor-1 by loss of oxygen and ATP leads to
activation of MMP-2. The constitutive enzyme
pro-membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase-MMP
is activated by the convertase, Furin, and it
activates proMMP-2. Secondary neuroinflammation
with the formation of cytokines (TNF-
and IL-1) and induction of MMP-9 and
MMP-3 occurs. ProMMP-9 is activated by
MMP-3 and free radicals. Active MMPs
degrade the basal lamina and tight junctions of
endothelial cells, thereby opening the BBB.
Opening of the BBB leads to vasogenic
edema.

radicals using recombinant superoxide dismutase or polyethylene
glycol-superoxide dismutase reduces ischemiainduced
BBB injury and vasogenic edema. Superoxide
dismutase1-overexpressing mice also have reduced activation
of MMP-9 by reactive oxygen species, which may be
involved in early BBB disruption and progressive striatal
damage induced by the mitochondrial excitotoxin,
3-nitropropionic acid.13
Normobaric hyperoxia in the early stages of stroke reduces
disruption of the BBB in reperfusion injury.14 The increased
oxygen acts on cells in the penumbra. When hyperoxia is
used with tPA, there is reduction in hemorrhagic complications
from tPA, probably because of the protection of the
BBB. Rats treated with combined normobaric hyperoxia and
tPA showed significantly reduced tPA-associated mortality,
brain edema, hemorrhage, and MMP-9 induction compared
with tPA alone.15
Blood–Brain Barrier Studies in Humans
In the early stages of an infarct in humans, blood vessels have
increased permeability, which can be seen in the meninges
over the area of the stroke. Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images obtained
several hours after injection showed disruption of the BBB,
which appeared as enhancement in sulci over the infarct area.
This was termed hyperintense acute reperfusion marker, and
was found in one third of ischemic stroke patients; those with
the sign had a higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation and
worse clinical outcome compared with those who did not
(Figure 3).16
Growth of intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in the first 24
hours.17 Treatment with Factor VII, which promotes clotting,
in an early study reduced the growth, but in a second study
failed to show an effect, and there is no proven treatment to
reduce lesion growth in intracranial hemorrhage.18The extent
of hemorrhagic transformation after stroke correlated with
MMP-9 elevation in the blood.19
Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction in Chronic
Cerebrovascular Disease
BBB abnormalities have been described in patients with
small-vessel disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes.
Cerebrospinal fluid studies have documented increased
albumin, which is an indicator of a disrupted BBB.20
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides a quantitative
measurement of permeability.21 Patients with large white
matter hyperintensities and symptoms suggestive of subcortical
ischemic vascular disease had increased BBB
permeability as measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced
MRI, which paralleled changes in cerebrospinal fluid
albumin index (Figure 4).22
Blood vessels undergo profound changes with aging.
Tortuosity of the vessels and thickening of the vessel walls is
found at autopsy in elderly patients, which results in reduced
vascular reactivity in the regions of the white matter with
hyperintensities on MRI.23 Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia
are the major factors besides age that cause
changes in the blood vessels responsible for the impairments
in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, along with increase
in permeability.24,25 The vulnerability of white matter is
caused by multiple factors because it is the end of arterial
circulation to the brain.26 Large epidemiological studies
utilizing MRI and cognitive testing show a high incidence of
changes in white matter after age 65 years associated with
cognitive decline.27 There is a gradual growth in white matter
lesions over time.28
Autopsy studies show the presence of hypoxia inducible
factor-1 in affected white matter supporting a role of
hypoxia in the process that leads to death of the oligodendrocytes
and extensive gliosis.29 Several etiologies are proposed
to explain changes in white matter. Silent strokes are suspected
in many cases, and may be the initiating event,
particularly when hypertension is damaging blood vessels.30
An alternative mechanism is disruption of the NVU with
vasogenic edema. Support of a disturbed BBB comes from
autopsy studies of patients with Binswanger’s disease that
show the presence of serum proteins in the brain.31A possible
cause of BBB damage is the presence of MMPs in white
matter at autopsy in patients with vascular dementia.32 Reactive
astrocytes that are positive for glial fibrillary acidic
protein are immunoreactive for MMP-2, whereas microglia/
macrophages stain for MMP-3.
Mechanisms to explain the inflammatory process have
been revealed by animal studies. Rats with hypoxic hypoperfusion
induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion have

increased MMP-2 in white matter and have chronic gliosis;
MMP-2 knockout mice had less disruption of the BBB and
damage to white matter.33
Translational Aspects of Blood–Brain Barrier
Disruption in Stroke
MMP inhibitors (MMPI) block the early opening of the BBB,
and COX-2 inhibitors are effective in the delayed phase.
Several MMPIs have been tested and shown to have efficacy
in animals, including BB-94, BB-1101, and GM6001 along
with selective COX-2 inhibitors.34,35 Joint problems occurred
when MMPIs were given chronically to cancer patients,36 but
short-term use of MMPIs may avoid side-effects.37
Minocycline is an MMPI with multiple actions, including
anti-inflammatory effects, and is well-tolerated in low doses
over long periods of time.38 Treatment with minocycline
benefits patients with multiple sclerosis, most likely
through protection of the BBB.39 Another potential treatment
is the use of COX-2 inhibitors, which block the
secondary opening of the BBB in experimental stroke.
Concern about cardiac side effects, which were seen with
long-term use of these agents in arthritis, is less likely to be
present in the short-term use.
Contrary to their deleterious actions in the early stages
of an acute stroke, MMPs may aid in the recovery process.
Poststroke angiogenesis is the key step for recovery after
ischemia and provides critical neurovascular substrates for
neuronal remodeling after stroke.40 In the process of
angiogenesis, loss of vascular integrity and degradation of
cell matrix are crucial initiating steps. MMPs degrade the
extracellular matrix and prepare the stage for growth
factors and guidance molecules. MMPs can also cleave
many signaling molecules, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor, which induces the proliferation of endothe-

lial cells, and promotes their release from matrix-bound
compartments or cell surface.41 Recent studies have shown
that long-term inhibition of MMPs decreased migration of
neuroblast cells from the subventricular zone, and reduced
neuronal plasticity and the number of newly formed
vessels, leading to an increase in tissue damage in periinfarct
cortex.42
An important aspect of the design of treatment protocols
for acute and chronic stroke is the dual nature of the
molecules targeted for treatment. Many of those molecules
that participate in the death of cells in early stages of injury
also play a critical role in the recovery period. An example is
that the benefit derived from MMPI treatment in the early
stages of injury may be lost if the same enzymes are blocked
later in angiogensis and neurogenesis.43 Understanding timing
of the expression of each of the agents to be blocked and
their actions at each point of the injury cycle is necessary in
planning the use of inhibitors. In the future, as multiple
cascades are better understood, treatments will be tailored to
start when the damaging effects of that agent are maximal and
to be stopped as the beneficial effects begin.
In conclusion, we have described some of the major
advances in understanding the function of the NVU at the
molecular level. Unraveling the proteins that comprise tight
junctions provided tools to observe the effects of proteases,
such as MMPs, on tight junctions following acute stroke.
Agents that block BBB disruption can protect the brain from
adverse effects of tPA, extending the therapeutic window.
The combined effect of agents that act early, including
MMPIs and those that protect delayed opening of the BBB,
such as COX-2 inhibitors, need to be tested. Recent studies of
chronic effects of hypoperfusion in humans and animals
demonstrate a role for MMPs in both disruption of the BBB
and the breakdown of myelin, which may contribute to the
death of oligodendrocytes. Defining the molecular mechanisms
underlying damage to the vasculature provides important
information on which to base additional trials of novel
therapies to protect the BBB.
