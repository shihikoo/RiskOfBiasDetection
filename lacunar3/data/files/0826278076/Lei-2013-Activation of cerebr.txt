Abstract—Cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral
hemorrhage and other brain insults trigger neurogenesis
in the subventricular zone and hippocampal
subgranular zone, and newly formed blood vessels promote
the migration of these new neuronal cells to damaged brain
regions. The molecular steps involved in brain injuryinduced
angiogenesis and neurogenesis are unclear. Here
we used a rat model of collagenase-induced intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) to examine whether matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9), a zinc endopeptidase that regulates
growth factor levels during recovery from brain injury, is
involved in neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH.
Induction of ICH led to significant increases in the levels
of MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
nerve growth factor (NGF), as well as in the numbers of
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)- and doublecortin (DCX)-
positive cells, in the ipsilateral brain. Intracerebroventricular
injection of MMP-9 siRNA reduced these ICH-induced
increases. These findings suggest that MMP-9 may promote
angiogenesis and neurogenesis during recovery from ICH.

INTRODUCTION
Neural stem cells, which can regenerate new neurons,
reside mainly in the subventricular zone and
hippocampal subgranular zone of the brain. During
neurogenesis, these neural stem cells differentiate into
new neurons, which then migrate to damaged brain
regions, where they compensate for lost function
(Chopp et al., 2007; Font et al., 2010; Kojima et al.,
2010). Neurogenesis is enhanced by cerebral insults
such as cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (Chopp et al., 2007;
Shen et al., 2008).
Blood vessels play an important scaffolding role to
help new neurons migrate to damaged brain regions
and provide trophic material to new neurons (Chopp
et al., 2007; Kojima et al., 2010). Neural stem cells and
progenitor cells in the central nervous system are found
near blood vessels, and neural stem cells are observed
near blood vessels in sites of brain injury (Lee et al.,
2006). Microvessels and neurons interact closely with
each other in the central nervous system (del Zoppo,
2010), and angiogenesis colocalizes with neurogenesis
within the neurovascular unit at sites of brain damage.
The molecules that promote this neurogenesis and
angiogenesis after brain injuries such as ICH remain
unclear.
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a zinc
endopeptidase that plays important roles in the
physiology and pathology of the central nervous system.
It regulates various components of brain extracellular
matrix (Lee et al., 2006; Barkho et al., 2008). During the
acute phase of mammalian stroke, MMP-9 plays a
detrimental role by degrading neurovascular matrix,
which aggravates injury to the blood–brain barrier and
contributes to hemorrhage (Romanic et al., 1998;
Montaner et al., 2001; Fukuda et al., 2004; Xue and
Wee Yong, 2008; Park et al., 2009; Yagi et al., 2009).
However, MMP-9 plays beneficial roles during the
recovery phase after various brain insults. For example,
it mediates neuroblast migration from the subventricular
zone to damaged striatum in a mouse model of focal
stroke (Lee et al., 2006). MMP-9 exerts these beneficial
effects by cleaving extracellular matrix and modulating
the intercellular microenvironment, which allows it to
regulate cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (Zhao
et al., 2007). In addition, MMP-9 regulates the levels of
various growth factors by controlling their release from
compartments hidden in the matrix (Rosell and Lo,
2008). Thus, several lines of evidences suggest that
MMP-9 promotes the recovery of brain tissue after
various insults. However, we are unaware of studies
examining its involvement in recovery specifically
following ICH.

Here we used collagenase-induced ICH in rats to
examine the effects of MMP-9 on neurogenesis and
angiogenesis during recovery. To examine whether
MMP-9 is involved in these processes, we examined
brain recovery in the presence and absence of small
interfering RNA (siRNA) (Hu et al., 2009) that
suppressed MMP-9 expression.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and treatment groups
All experiments were performed using male Sprague–Dawley
rats (270–320 g) in accordance with the guidelines for animal
research at Sichuan University. Rats were randomly divided
into the following groups (n= 22 in each): (1) siRNA group, in
which rats underwent ICH induction, and then were treated with
anti-MMP-9 siRNA on days 7 and 10 after induction; (2) ICH
group, in which rats underwent ICH induction and received
injections of saline solution instead of siRNA; and (3) sham
group, in which rats underwent the same surgical procedures
as the ICH group but without ICH induction, and they received
saline solution instead of siRNA.
Surgical procedures and collagenase induction of
ICH
Rats in the ICH group were anesthetized with 3.6% chloral
hydrate (ZSGB, China; l ml/100 g) and placed in a stereotaxic
frame. After disinfection and incision, a hole was drilled in the
skull and collagenase VII (Sigma C0773, 2.0ll) was injected
via Hamilton syringe into the striatum at 0.2 mm anterior,
3.0 mm lateral, and 5.5 mm ventral from bregma. The syringe
was kept in position for 2 min to prevent backflow of
collagenase, then slowly removed. A thermo-regulated heating
pad was used to maintain the epidermal temperature at 37C
(Okauchi et al., 2009). Rats in the sham group underwent the
same procedures except that 0.9% saline solution (ZSGB,
China) was used instead of collagenase VII and anti-MMP-9
siRNA (described below).
siRNA treatment
Rats in the siRNA group received intracerebroventricular
injections of MMP-9 siRNA (10ll, 5lmol/L) on days 7 and 10
after ICH induction. The siRNA dose was based on previous
work (Aleksandrova and Danilova, 2010; Fu et al., 2011). The
scheduling of siRNA was based on the work of Tang’s study
(Tang et al., 2007) who reported that after collagenase-induced
ICH in rats, new vessels began to appear around the
hematoma and extend into it starting at 7 d, with formation of
new neurons peaking between 7 and 14 d. It was also based
on Zhao’s study (Zhao et al., 2006), who reported that after
stroke MMP-9 was upregulated in peri-infarct cortex 7–14 d,
with FN-439 inhibitor injected intracerebroventricularly at 7 d in
rat. The sequence of the siRNA primer was designed and
synthesized by RiboBio (China). In parallel, rats in the ICH and
sham groups received intracerebroventricular injections of 0.9%
saline solution.
Labeling with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
For labeling of S-phase cells, rats were given intraperitoneal
injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma, USA;
100 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% saline once a day for 14 d after
ICH.
Western blot analysis of MMP-9 and growth factors
On days 10 and 14 after ICH induction, extracts of rat striatum
were prepared by homogenizing the tissue at 4C for 30 min in
lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Catalog No.
78415, Roche, USA). Extracts were centrifuged at 13,300 rpm
at 4C for 40 min. Supernatants were mixed with a loading
buffer containing dithiothreitol (DDT), and the mixtures were
heated at 100C for 10 min. The mixtures were then subjected
to 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophores, after which
proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore, USA).
To detect MMP-9, nerve growth factor (NGF), and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), membranes were incubated
for 2 h at 37C in TBST dilutions of the following antibodies
(Abcam, USA): anti-MMP-9 polyclonal antibody (1:500), anti-
VEGF (1:1000), anti-NGF (1:500), and anti-b-actin (1:1000).
Then membranes were incubated with the appropriate HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam, USA) for 1 h at 37C.
The blotted protein bands were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence and quantified using Image 1.46 software
(U.S. National Institutes of Health; n= 5 for each group).
Immunohistochemistry analysis of MMP-9 and VEGF
On days 10 and 14 after ICH induction, three rats from each
group were anesthetized and perfused with 0.9% saline,
followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were isolated and
fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4C. Brain tissue was paraffinembedded
and cut into sections 16 mm thick. Sections were
incubated with anti-MMP-9 (1:400) and anti-VEGF (1:500)
overnight at 4C, followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody for
15 min at room temperature. The striatum was observed by
light microscopy and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0
(Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
Immunofluorescence analysis of MMP-9, growth
factors, and cell proliferation
On days 10 and 14 after ICH induction, three rats from each
group were anesthetized and perfused with 0.9% saline,
followed by PFA. After deparaffinization and rehydration, brain
sections were incubated overnight at 4C with anti-MMP-9
(1:400), anti-VEGF (1:500), anti-NGF (1:200), anti-BrdU (1:500;
Abcam, USA), and anti-doublecortin (DCX) (1:200; Abcam,
USA), followed by secondary anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h at
room temperature. Finally, the striatum was observed by light
microscopy and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). Integrated optical density
(IOD) was used to quantify positive cells (3 rat sections for
each group).
Evaluation of neurological severity scores
On days 10 and 14 after ICH induction, the neurological severity
scores (Chen et al., 2001) were determined for 10 rats from each
group by two observers blinded to group assignments. Motor
ability was tested using an assay in which the animal was
raised by the tail and his response was scored on a 3-point
scale: 1 point was given if he flexed his forelimb, 1 point if he
flexed his hindlimb, and 1 point if he moved his head >10
from the vertical axis within 30 s (maximum score = 3 points).
Walking ability was assessed by placing the animal on the floor
and scoring his walk on a 3-point scale: 0, normal walk; 1,
unable to walk straight; 2, circling toward the paretic side; 3,
falling down on the paretic side.
Sensory ability was assessed using a placing test, which
examined both visual and tactile responses. It was further
assessed using a proprioceptive test to induce deep sensation,
C. Lei et al./Neuroscience 230 (2013) 86–93 87
(TRIAL VER. PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1186664495)
by pushing the paw against the table edge to stimulate limb
muscles. One point was given for the inability to perform each
test, for a total possible score of 2 points.
Balance was assessed using a beam balance test, which
was graded on a 6-point scale: 0, balances with steady
posture; 1, grasps side of beam; 2, hugs the beam and one
limb falls down from the beam; 3, hugs the beam and two limbs
fall down from the beam, or spins on the beam for >60 s; 4,
attempts to balance on the beam but falls off after 40 s; 5,
attempts to balance on the beam but falls off after 20 s; 6, falls
off after 20 s without making any attempt to balance or hang on
to the beam.
Animal reflexes and the presence of abnormal movements
were assessed by testing the pinna reflex, in order to
determine whether the head shakes when the auditory meatus
is touched; testing the corneal reflex, to determine whether the
eye blinks when the cornea is lightly touched with cotton; and
testing the startle reflex, to determine motor response to a brief
noise generated by snapping a clipboard. One point was given
when the tested reflex was absent. An additional point was
given for the presence of seizures, myoclonus, or myodystony.
The total points for all these neurological function tests
(maximum possible = 18) were summed for each animal and
used to generate a mean ± SD for each group.
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). All data
are presented as mean ± SD, and differences were considered
statistically significant at the 5% level.
RESULTS
ICH-induced changes in MMP-9 and VEGF levels by
immunohistochemistry
Levels of MMP-9 and VEGF on days 10 and 14 after ICH
induction were significantly higher in the ICH group than in
the sham group (date not shown) (Fig. 1A and 1B).
Administration of MMP-9 siRNA following ICH induction
partially reduced these increases (MMP-9: ICH 10 or
14 d vs. siRNA, p< 0.01; F= 795.428; VEGF: ICH 10
or 14 d vs. siRNA, p< 0.01; F= 205.135).
ICH-induced changes in MMP-9, VEGF and NGF
levels by Western blotting
Levels of MMP-9, VEGF and NGF by Western blot were
significantly higher in the ICH group than in the sham
group on days 10 and 14 after ICH induction (Fig. 2).
Administration of siRNA against MMP-9 partially
reduced the ICH-induced increase in MMP-9 in the
ipsilateral striatum, though the level remained higher
than in sham animals (ICH 10 or 14 d vs. siRNA,
p< 0.01; siRNA 10 or 14 d vs. sham, p< 0.01;
F= 957.411). Similar results were obtained for VEGF
(ICH 10 or 14 d vs. siRNA, p< 0.01; siRNA 10 or 14 d
vs. sham, p< 0.01; F= 1810.444) and NGF (ICH 10
or 14 d vs. siRNA, p< 0.01; siRNA 10 or 14 d vs.
sham, p< 0.01; F= 1944.666).
ICH-induced changes in MMP-9, VEGF and NGF
levels by immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence assays to examine levels of MMP-9,
VEGF and NGF after ICH induction gave similar results
as Western blot experiments. Levels of these proteins
were higher in the ICH group than in the sham group on
days 10 and 14 after induction (ICH 10 or 14 d vs.
sham, p< 0.01; Fig. 3). Administration of MMP-9
siRNA reduced the ICH-induced increases in MMP-9
around the hematoma, though the levels of all analyzed
proteins remained higher than in the sham group (ICH
10 or 14 d vs. siRNA, p< 0.01; siRNA 10 or 14 d vs.
sham, p< 0.01; F= 414.248).
ICH-induced changes in numbers of DCX- and BrdU-
positive cells by immunofluorescence
The ICH group showed significantly more DCX- and
BrdU-positive cells than the sham group on days 10 and
14 after ICH induction (p< 0.01; Fig. 4). Administration
of siRNA against MMP-9 reduced these ICH-induced
increases: the numbers were higher in the ICH group
than in the siRNA group at both time points (p< 0.01).
Nevertheless, the numbers of DCX- and BrdU-positive
cells were still higher than in the sham group (p< 0.01;
F= 305.872).
Evaluation of neurological function
ICH caused significant neurological deficits, as assessed
using a battery of tests (Fig. 5). Administration of siRNA
against MMP-9 significantly inhibited recovery:
neurological function was significantly lower in the
siRNA group than in the ICH and sham groups on days
10 and 14 after induction (p< 0.01, F= 182.903).
DISCUSSION
Our results show that induction of ICH led to significant
increases in the levels of MMP-9 in the ipsilateral brain.
This was associated with increases in the expression of
growth factors such as VEGF and NGF, as well as in
the numbers of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells.
Intracerebroventricular injection of MMP-9 siRNA
reduced these increases in ipsilateral brain, suggesting
that MMP-9 may promote neurogenesis and
angiogenesis during recovery from ICH.
Substantial evidence indicates that MMP-9 is
necessary for tissue recovery after various brain insults.
The peptidase is believed to participate in tissue
recovery through several mechanisms: by degrading
extracellular matrix and allowing cell migration, such as
the migration of new neuronal cells to sites of brain
injury; by altering the microenvironment of the
extracellular matrix and thereby regulating cellular
interaction; and by modulating the activity of regulatory
molecules or enzymes directly by cleaving them or
releasing them from bound stores, or indirectly by
modulating the activity of their inhibitors (Vu and Werb,
2000). These previous studies have examined primarily
animal models of cerebral ischemia and seizure. Our
study extends these findings by directly implicating
MMP-9 in brain recovery after collagenase-induced ICH
in rats.
Our findings suggest that MMP-9 may participate in
neurogenesis during recovery from ICH. During

(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-835292604)
neurogenesis, new neuronal cells migrate toward
damaged tissue, where they differentiate into mature
neurons that compensate for the loss of neuronal
function (Galis and Khatri, 2002; Ergul et al., 2012).
Similar to our results with ICH, studies in a rat model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia found that BrdU- and
DCX-positive cells from the subventricular zone
associated with extracellular MMP-9 over a 2-week
recovery period (Lee et al., 2006). MMP-9 expressed by
adult neural stem/progenitor cells has been shown to
regulate the response of these cells to ischemic insult
(Barkho et al., 2008). In fact, MMP-9 has been shown to
play a novel role in stimulating hippocampal synaptic
physiology, plasticity, and memory in studies involving
mutant mice lacking the peptidase (Nagy et al., 2006;
Wang et al., 2006). Consistent with our findings, studies
of the later phases of stroke in a rat model found
increased MMP-9 labeling in the peri-infarct cortex,
which related to markers of neurovascular recovery
such as neurons and astroglia (Zhao et al., 2006).
Several lines of evidences suggest that MMP-9 may
promote neurogenesis through NGF (Shubayev and
Myers, 2004). MMP-9 participates in a membrane
sialidase-dependent signaling pathway that is initiated
by NGF and that is essential for growth of primary
neurons and neurite outgrowth (Jayanth et al., 2010). In
a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, MMP-9
activation in the brain may activate the NGF receptor
system indirectly or directly in order to stimulate
neurogenesis (Nico et al., 2004). Our study found MMP-9
levels to be abundant in ipsilateral brain where BrdU-
and DCX-positive cells and NGF levels were also high.
This is consistent with another study reporting that NGF
stimulated the differentiation of BrdU-positive cells into
mature neurons and increased the number of BrdU-
positive cells in the subventricular zone on the ischemic
side of the brain in a model of cerebral ischemia (Font
et al., 2010). Our findings in this rat model of ICH
suggest that, as in other types of brain injury, MMP-9
may interact with NGF during recovery to promote
neurogenesis.
At the same time, our results suggest that MMP-9 may
promote revascularization after ICH by upregulating
VEGF expression. ICH-induced changes in MMP-9 were
associated with increases in VEGF levels in the
ipsilateral brain, and these increases were reduced by
siRNA inhibition of MMP-9. MMP-9 acts via a VEGF
pathway to play a significant role in bone marrow cell
mobilization and focal angiogenesis in the brain (Hao
et al., 2011). MMP-9 and VEGF activity appear to
promote angiogenesis by stimulating bone formation
and reducing inflammation (Tete` et al., 2011); indeed,
inhibiting activation of MMPs and VEGF restrained
angiogenesis in a mouse model of radiation-induced
tumor angiogenesis (Pratheeshkumar and Kuttan,
2011). MMP-9 produced by stromal granulocytes
promoted angiogenesis indirectly by interacting with
VEGF in vitro, and inhibiting MMP-9 was as effective as

after ICH induction in the ipsilateral striatum (p< 0.01). Representative results are shown (n= 3 for each rat group). Scale bar = 50 mm.

inhibiting VEGF for suppressing this angiogenesis
(Bausch et al., 2011). Our results with ICH extend
previous findings from other models of brain injury. In a
model of cerebral ischemia, VEGF was found to bind to
VEGF Receptor-2, which was expressed mainly on
activated astrocytes in the central nervous system, and
to promote revascularization and repair of the blood–
brain barrier by providing metabolic and trophic support

to the injured tissue (Lee et al., 2007; Krum et al., 2008;
Shimotake et al., 2010; Hao et al., 2011). In a rat model
of stroke, VEGF enhanced angiogenesis in the ischemic
brain and reduced neurological deficits during recovery
(Zhang et al., 2000). In rats with focal cerebral
ischemia, VEGF signal was detected in the peri-infarct
cortex, and inhibition of MMP-9 suppressed this signal
and compromised stroke recovery (Bergers et al., 2000;
Zhao et al., 2006). In addition to acting in the ipsilateral
brain, VEGF has been shown to exert neurotrophic and
mitogenic effects on cells in the peripheral nervous
system (Sondell et al., 1999). Future studies should
examine whether MMP-9 activates VEGF during
recovery from ICH by cleaving the growth factor and

promoting its release from matrix-bound compartments or
from the cell surface.
The present study takes the first steps toward
identifying the molecules involved in promoting recovery
after ICH. Our results suggest that, as in other forms of
brain injury, MMP-9 may play an important role by
promoting neurogenesis and angiogenesis, perhaps by
upregulating NGF and VEGF expression. Future studies
should examine exactly how MMP-9 affects these
growth factors and whether MMP-9 plays additional
roles in promoting recovery of neurological function.
Future studies should also examine how angiogenesis
promotes the migration of new neurons from the
subventricular zone to injured brain after ICH.
