Acute stroke is one of the main causes of death and chronic
disability. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator within the first hours after onset of symptoms is an
effective therapeutic option for ischemic stroke. However,
fewer than 2% to 7% of patients receive this treatment, primarily
because most patients reach the hospital too late for
the initiation of successful therapy. Several measures can
reduce detrimental delay until treatment. It is of importance to
use continual public awareness campaigns to reduce delays in
patients’ alarm of emergency medical services. Further relevant
measures are repetitive education of emergency medical
services teams to ensure the systematic use of scales designed
for recognition of stroke symptoms and the proper triage of
patients to stroke centers. A most important time-saving
measure is prenotification of the receiving hospital by the
emergency medical services team. In the future, treatment
already at the emergency site may allow more than a small
minority of patients to benefit from available treatment.

Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and the most frequent
reason for permanent disability (1). Thrombolysis with recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved and
causal therapy for acute ischemic stroke (2). The benefit of this
therapy is, however, extremely time sensitive: The number needed
to treat to achieve a good outcome is 4·5 if treatment starts within
1·5 h. This number doubles to 9 if treatment is initiated within 1·5
to 3·0 h and reaches 14·1 if treatment occurs within the temporal
window of 3·0 to 4·5 h (3).The‘time is brain’concept that has been
derived from such observations is also supported by earlier experimental
animal research (4,5) and by calculations indicating that
for each minute in which a stroke remains untreated, as many as
1·9 million neurons and 14 billion synapses may die (6).
However, before rt-PA can be administered, a complex diagnostic
workup, including neurological examination, imaging studies,
and laboratory tests, is necessary to exclude hemorrhage or other
contraindications to rt-PA therapy. For this reason, treatment
within the narrow temporal window of a few hours is difficult to
achieve in clinical reality, and, in the end, no more than 2% to 7%
of all acute stroke patients currently receive treatment (7).
The blame for this problem of undertreatment with thrombolysis
can be placed primarily on activities that occur before the
patient reaches the doors of the hospital. In Germany, for
example, the median prehospital time is 151 mins, and only 45%
of patients reach the hospital within three-hours (8). Data from
the American Get With the Guidelines Stroke Registry clearly
show that, despite considerable attempts to improve stroke management
(e.g., by public education programs), delays in the time
to hospital admission did not improve in recent years (9) [for a
detailed systematic literature review on prehospital delays, see
Evenson et al. (10)].
Methods
This review examined reports published since 1980 and found by
searching PubMed for articles containing the terms ‘stroke management
’; ‘prehospital’ and ‘stroke’; ‘stroke’ and ‘educational campaign
(s)’; ‘stroke’ and ‘public awareness’; and ‘emergency medical
service’ and ‘stroke’. Articles were selected on the basis of their
originality and their relevance to the topic of prehospital stroke
management.
Results and discussion
Role of patients and relatives
Problems in prehospital stroke management can be attributed to
two groups: the patients and their families, and the emergency
medical services (EMS) team. With regard to the role of the
patients and their relatives, it is important to consider that 24% to
55% of acute stroke patients or their relatives do not notify the
EMS within one-hour, but rather use a private vehicle to transport
the patient to the hospital, visit their family doctor, wait too long,
or do not notify anyone (11–13). Many reasons for this inadequate
response to stroke symptoms have been described and may
be demographic, social, medical, or psychological in nature [(11–
19), Table 1].
Stroke educational campaigns could, therefore, be a solution
for improving patients’ and families’ awareness of the correct
response in case of stroke. Such campaigns have been shown to
have a short-term impact on stroke symptom knowledge.
However, consistent evidence confirms an existing gap between

the knowledge and recognition of stroke symptoms and the
appropriate urgent response to such symptoms (for detailed systematic
literature reviews, see Teuschl & Brainin, Jones et al., and
Lecouturier et al. (20–22)).
A very recent study consisting of individual semi-structured
interviews with stroke patients, stroke witnesses, and primary care
clinicians examined the perceived impact of and views about the
United Kingdom’s mass media campaign Act FAST. Most participants
were aware of the Act FAST campaign, and some patients
and witnesses reported that the campaign affected their stroke
recognition and response, but most reported no effect. Clinicians
were positive about the campaign and believed that it had affected
stroke awareness and recognition, but doubted its impact on
response behavior (23).
Only a few of these existing studies, however, analyzed the
effects on clinically relevant end-points of stroke management,
such as time to hospital admission or thrombolysis rates [(24–31),
Table 2]. These variables are examined primarily in interventional
studies with a noncontrolled ‘before and after intervention’
design. Only two of the currently existing studies applied a controlled
design, including control groups of patients from catchment
areas without such interventions (Table 2). Most of these
studies revealed the effects of public awareness campaigns on
patients’ behavior (Table 2); however, these effects probably last
for no more than five-months. Because of studies showing that
the nature of the effects of such campaigns is rather transient
(26), constant repetition of their message is a central precondition
for their success (26).
These findings suggest that public education efforts are worthwhile
, and future efforts should focus more strongly on specific
target groups, such as the elderly, minorities, neighbors of stroke
survivors, medical students, and even children (who may be future
relatives, patients, or physicians) (32–36). Importantly, educational
campaigns should present in a very simple message the
action that should be undertaken in case of emergency (e.g., ‘call
EMS immediately’). However, rather than relying on a fear appeal
alone,which is more likely to cause people to stop a behavior rather
than to perform an action, such a message should also be encouraging.
Thus, a still-ongoing campaign, the National Stroke Association
’s Faces of Stroke multimedia public awareness campaign
(37) presents the personal and emotional side of stroke, including
stories of stroke survivors and caregivers, thereby aiming to generate
empathic feelings and to transmit the positive message of the
existence of treatment. In general, the major problem of undertreatment
of stroke and change of behavior is a highly interdisciplinary
task, including, for example, the contribution of health
behavior scientists in assessing concepts of behavior change.
Role of the EMS
Structures of EMS systems differ not only between countries but
also within single countries. This is especially the case with regard
to the variable disposition of an emergency physician when acute
stroke is suspected. However, a large body of evidence already
exists for some measures of acute stroke management, and, therefore
, clear recommendations have been given by national and
international stroke management guidelines (38,39). These
guidelines include the recommendation of continued education
of the EMS team regarding the use of instruments for the recognition
of stroke symptoms, the emergency transport of patients to
a hospital with stroke expertise, and, finally, the prenotification of
the receiving hospital.
Use of instruments for symptom recognition
It has been shown that the accuracy with which EMS dispatchers
identify stroke symptoms is highly variable, ranging from 30% to
83% (40,41); this finding highlights the need for continued
further training. Most national and international stroke guidelines
recommend, apart from medical training, the use of structured
interviews by the dispatcher and the application of
instruments designed for recognition of stroke symptoms by the
EMS team in the field. For example, the Cincinnati Prehospital
Stroke Scale (sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 66% for the
presence of acute stroke) is based on the presence of facial paresis,
one-sided paresis of an upper extremity, and speech disorder (by
asking the patients to repeat specific sentences) (42). The Los
Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen includes, in addition to these
items, four additional questions about history and the results of a
glucose test (43). The sensitivity (91%) and specificity (97%) of
this scale are very high (43); however, this scale is quite complex
for routine daily use and is also time consuming. The Face Arm
Speech Time (FAST) Stroke Assessment is based on the three
elements of the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, but it assesses
possible speech disorders during normal conservation (44). This
scale has a sensitivity of 79% and is so easy to perform that it can
even be used by the general public.
Whereas in the United States either the Los Angeles Prehospital
Stroke Screen or the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale is most

frequently used, in Europe the FAST Scale is most widely distributed
; and in Australia the Melbourne Stroke Screen (45) is most
often used. In general, however, the daily routine of the dispatcher
and of the EMS team is still characterized by the mostly nonsystematic
and undocumented use of such instruments; this finding
underscores the importance of further training efforts.
Prioritized transport to hospitals with stroke expertise
Prioritized transport to hospitals with stroke expertise and with
the option for thrombolytic treatment is crucial in optimized
prehospital stroke management. Such measure has been shown to
reduce time to treatment and to increase thrombolysis rates
without negatively influencing the quality of treatment of other
emergencies (46). An additional reason for this recommendation
is the strong evidence of a general benefit for treatment in a
specialized stroke unit. In specific settings, the use of helicopters
for transport to more distant stroke centers can also save critical
time to treatment (47). A recent prospective multicentric study
showed that treatment rates increase from 14·1% to 21·9% (OR,
1·72; 95% CI, 1·22–2·43) if patients are transported to stroke
centers rather than to nonspecialized institutions (48). This is
even the case if the distance to a stroke center is considerably
greater than that to a nonspecialized hospital.
Most advanced stroke management protocols, such as a citywide
protocol implemented in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (49),
also include, apart from the use of standardized screening systems
by the EMS team, the implementation of protocols for bypassing
hospitals without stroke expertise. Such a protocol can be
achieved by innovative regional cooperation, with contracts
between hospitals regarding the later repatriation of the patients.
Key role of prenotification
Apart from the fact that the transmission of information regarding
the onset of symptoms or thrombolysis contraindications is
an integral component of the initial interaction between the EMS
team and the hospital stroke team, stroke management guidelines
(38,39) additionally recommend prenotification of the receiving
hospital about the arriving patient. This prenotification allows the
fastest possible activation of the stroke team and, especially, the
reservation of computed tomography (CT) scanners. Previous
interventional studies of the effects of prenotification of the hospital
team alone or in combination with further restructuring of
stroke management plans showed that crucial time to therapy can
be saved and thrombolysis rates can significantly be increased
[(50–57), Table 3]. The existing studies compared findings
regarding the effects of a prenotification intervention either with
findings from a historical control group or with findings from a
parallel observation of patientsfor whom no such prenotification
intervention was used (Table 3). So far, no data from randomized
studies are available, and, in light of ethical aspects and because
the existing studies already consistently show a considerable acceleration
of in-hospital treatment, it is unlikely that such studies
will ever be performed in the future. Regarding methodology, the
transfer of structured clinical data between the EMS team at the
emergency site and the hospital stroke team could also be optimized
by the use of personal digital assistants (58) or smart
phones (59).
Interestingly, one study found that combining the concept of
prenotification with additional improvements in in-hospital
stroke management resulted in a ‘door-to-needle’ time of only
20 mins (56). The philosophy behind these very short door-toneedle
times is, according to the Finnish authors,‘to do as little as
possible after the patient has been arrived in the clinic, and as
much as possible when the patient is on the way to the clinic’ (56).
Telemedicine interaction between regional hospital and stroke
center and perspectives for communication between
emergency site and stroke center
By using systems for bidirectional audiovisual videoconferencing
and exchange of videos of the examination of the patient and of
CT scans, nonspecialized regional hospitals can already obtain
guidance in stroke treatment from hospitals designated as stroke
centers [(60), Fig. 1]. Previous studies not only showed that such
telemedicine interaction between two hospitals is reliable and safe
(61–64), but also that it exerts positive effects on thrombolysis
rates and clinical outcome (65).
Importantly, such telemedicine technologies could in principle
also allow bidirectional communication between the EMS team at
the emergency site and the stroke center. Such strategies have been
investigated for many years (66,67); however, technical problems
such as the temporary loss of signals still today impair reliable
interaction between ambulance and hospital (68,69).
Prehospital stroke treatment: an alternative strategy
for reducing delay to treatment?
To achieve the goal of enabling more than a minority of stroke
patients to profit from recanalization therapies in the future, the
concept of prehospital stroke treatment has been elaborated upon
in the last decade [(70), Fig. 1]. This concept is based on the use of
an otherwise conventional ambulance that, additionally, contains
a small CT scanner and a point-of-care laboratory {mobile stroke
unit [(71), Fig. 2]}. This ambulance also contains equipment that
allows telemedicine interaction with the hospital, thereby making
possible bidirectional communication and transfer of videos or
CT scans of patients from the emergency site to the hospital.
A first randomized trial involving 100 patients recently showed
that, compared with optimized conventional stroke management,
prehospital stroke treatment reduces the time between alarm and
therapy decision from 76 to 35 mins (72). A therapy decision was
made within 60 mins after symptom onset (the ‘golden hour’) for
57% of the patients treated in the mobile stroke unit but for only
4% of the conventionally treated patients. This and other studies
of stroke treatment directly at the emergency site already document
a broad spectrum of additional novel medical options, especially
the option of triaging patients to the most appropriate
hospital on the basis of a diagnosis clarified before the patients are
transported. For example, patients with large-vessel occlusion
demonstrated by prehospital CT angiography could specifically
be triaged to specialized stroke centers that offer endovascular
treatment (73). Moreover, this strategy allows organization of
further specialized treatments and etiology-specific blood pressure
management already in the prehospital phase of stroke management
(73–75). The latter could be specifically clinically
relevant because there are indications that differential adjustment

of blood pressure can be beneficial for patients with ischemic
stroke (tolerating higher blood pressure values) or hemorrhagic
stroke (reducing elevated blood pressure) (76).
In the future, the concept of prehospital stroke treatment could
be complemented by the inclusion of other diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies, such as further imaging procedures, neuroprotective
strategies, or future hemorrhage therapies. However,
currently, prehospital stroke treatment is still a potential perspective
rather than clinical reality, and further research is still needed
with regard to the medical efficacy of and the best setting for this
concept. Finally, although many arguments suggest that increased
allocation of resources in the golden hour of stroke could save the
much higher costs of long-term care of disabled patients, the
cost-effectiveness of prehospital stroke treatment remains to be
demonstrated.
As limitation, this review on the different links of the prehospital
stroke rescue chain did not completely follow a systematic
approach as articles found by PubMed search were selected and
weighted based on their originality and their relevance to the
topic of prehospital stroke management.
In summary, this review indicates that prehospital delay is a
major reason that only a minority of patients obtain recanalizing
therapy today. Options for the improvement of prehospital stroke
management include, on the patient’s side, target-specific and
continual public awareness campaigns. On the EMS side, frequently
repeated training in the use of tools for symptom recognition
, prioritized transport to experienced stroke centers, and,
probably most important, prenotification of the receiving hospital
can improve time to treatment and treatment rates. In the
future, even prehospital stroke treatment could contribute to
better stroke management.
