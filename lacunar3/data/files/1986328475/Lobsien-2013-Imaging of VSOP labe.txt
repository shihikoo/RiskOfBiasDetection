Abstract
Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the detectability of stem cells labeled with very small iron oxide particles (VSOP) at
3T with susceptibility weighted (SWI) and T2* weighted imaging as a methodological basis for subsequent examinations in
a large animal stroke model (sheep).
Materials and Methods: We examined ovine mesenchymal stem cells labeled with VSOP in agarose layer phantoms. The
experiments were performed in 2 different groups, with quantities of 0–100,000 labeled cells per layer. 15 different SWI- and
T2*-weighted sequences and 3 RF coils were used. All measurements were carried out on a clinical 3T MRI. Images of Group
A were analyzed by four radiologists blinded for the number of cells, and rated for detectability according to a four-step
scale. Images of Group B were subject to a ROI-based analysis of signal intensities. Signal deviations of more than the 0.95
confidence interval in cell containing layers as compared to the mean of the signal intensity of non cell bearing layers were
considered significant.
Results: Group A: 500 or more labeled cells were judged as confidently visible when examined with a SWI-sequence with
0.15 mm slice thickness. Group B: 500 or more labeled cells showed a significant signal reduction in SWI sequences with a
slice thickness of 0.25 mm. Slice thickness and cell number per layer had a significant influence on the amount of detected
signal reduction.
Conclusion: 500 VSOP labeled stem cells could be detected with SWI imaging at 3 Tesla using an experimental design
suitable for large animal models.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the primary causes of acquired
disability in adults in the western world [1]. Therapeutic options
are limited. Particularly the timely recanalization of occluded
vessels as the only FDA-approved therapeutic intervention so far is
feasible only in a small number of patients [2–6]. Hence, there is a
strong demand for alternative therapeutic strategies and beneficial
effects could be demonstrated by administration of stem cell
therapy after stroke, mainly in small animal models. However, the
exact pathophysiological mechanisms and the optimal form of
stem cell therapy still need to be elucidated [5,7–9]. For example,
it is still not clear whether a particular stem cell population is
required to be present in the brain to unleash optimal therapeutic
effect. This is most likely the case for some particularly promising
stem cell populations thus tracking of intracerebrally located cells
in the human brain will become a relevant safety endpoint [10].
Therefore, different labeling techniques are already used to track
stem cells in vivo. One promising technique is the labeling of stem
cells with iron oxide nanoparticles and subsequent magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) [11–16]. It has been shown at 7 Tesla
and with T2* weighted sequences that stem cells labeled with very
small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (VSOP) migrate to
the border of ischemic regions within the brains of splenectomized
mice after systemic application [17]. However, a transition of these
results to large animal models is desirable for several reasons such
as the better differentiation of the brain anatomy with clinical
MRI scanners, the higher similarity of the gyrencephalic brain
anatomy to human brains, the more complex behavioral patterns
and the potential of long term safety/efficacy analyses using large
animal models [18,19]. On the other hand, large animal models

require larger bores of the MRI scanners, different coils and
therefore use lower field strengths in most cases. This results in
limitations of the achievable spatial resolution and of the
detectability of labeled cells with T2* weighted imaging [20,21].
Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is an alternative to T2*
weighted sequences for the detection of signal changes due to
ferro- and paramagnetic effects. It has been shown that SWI may
provide a higher resolution and a higher sensitivity for the imaging
of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic effects than T2* weighted
imaging [22–25]. This could be used to compensate, at least in
part, the above mentioned limitations of large animal examinations.
Here, we examined the sensitivity of SWI in comparison to T2*
weighted imaging for the detection of VSOP labeled mesenchymal
ovine stem cells in agarose phantoms at 3 Tesla in an experimental
setting suitable for the application in large animal models.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were approved by the Experimental
Animal Committee of the Regional Council of Leipzig (TVV 16/
07).
Stem Cells
Autologous ovine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were used for
all experiments. Bone marrow sample were harvested from the
iliac crest in sheep as described previously [26]. Briefly, animals
were placed in a prone position under general intravenous
anesthesia using 2% xylazine (0.1 mg/kg), ketamine (4.0 mg/kg),
and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) for harvest. The mononuclear cell
fraction was separated by density gradient centrifugation and
MSC were isolated from the MNC fraction by their ability to
adhere to the cell culture flask. For preparation of the phantoms
the desired cell numbers were determined using a Neubauer
counting chamber. The cells were then centrifuged at 3506g for 5
minutes and resuspended in Dulbeccos modified Eagle Medium
containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Particles
VSOP-5 nm particles (Ferropharm, Berlin, Germany) were
used for cell labeling. VSOP-5 nm consist of an iron oxide core of
5 nm diameter coated by a citrate monomer. As previously
published the uptake of VSOP-5 nm is, depending on the
concentration during the incubation, as high as 96% (at 3.0 mM
VSOP concentration in the medium) and significantly higher
compared to normal USPIO. Additionally VSOP-5 nm are less
cytotoxic [27,28]. Labeling of stem cells with VSOP-5 nm leads to
a significant reduction of T2 relaxation [29].
Cell Labeling
VSOP-5 nm were added to the medium in a concentration of
3.0 mM and the cells were incubated for 90 min at 37uC and 5%
CO
2
. No additional transfection agents were used. After incubation
the cells were washed three times with PBS and were
harvested. Afterwards, the cells were centrifuged at 3506g and
counted. To confirm cellular iron uptake we examined cells with
Prussian Blue staining (Figure 1A and 1B), relaxometry and
electron microscopy, confirming a labeling efficiency of.95% of
cells with this method. The reliability of VSOP labeling has also
been thoroughly tested in human MSC by Heymer et al. [30].

labeled MSC as well as a 4th layer with 100,000 non labeled MSC. The
other phantom contained layers with 100, 500, and 5,000 labeled MSC
as well as one more layer without MSC. Slices containing no MSC or
unlabeled MSC are indicated by white numbers.

Agarose Phantoms
For each phantom, 20 ml agarose were filled into a 50 ml
flacon, put into an ultrasound bath and consecutively centrifuged
at 15006g for one minute to remove air bubbles. For production
of the cell layers 50 mL cell suspension were mixed with 50 mLof
fluid agarose. The mixture of cell suspension and agarose was put
into an ultrasound bath and then pipetted onto the basal layer,
centrifuged at 5006g for 1 minute and consecutively cooled down.
At a cross sectional area of 5.6 cm2 this resulted in a calculated

The sequences are divided into groups (first column). Sequences ’’A’’ belong to group A, (rater-based analysis). Sequences ’’B’’ belong to group B, (ROI-based analysis).
The parameters most relevant to contrast (TR, TE and Flipangle) are the same in almost all of the T2* weighted or the SWI sequences.

inhomogeneities. Each value on the x-axis represents one slice of an aquired sequence. The datapoints on the x-axis therefore may vary from
sequence to sequence, depending on the amount of aquired slices. The mean signal intensity per slice (as by ROI analysis) is shown for each
individual slice on the y-axis, resulting in a curve with a varying resolution, depending on the amount of slices of each sequence. The original data is
shown in (A). Negative peaks of signal loss indicate cell-containing layers. A signal inhomogeneity along the B

axis corresponding to the long axis of
the agarose phantom is superimposed, resulting in a drop of signal intensity in the first and last slices of the sequence. To remove this signal
inhomogeneity without compromising cell derived peaks for further analysis a curve was fitted to the data after removal of the cell bearing slices (B)
and subsequently subtracted from the original data which resulted in a straightened curve, showing the peaks on a linear baseline (C).

layer thickness of approximately 17 mm. After cooling, 5 mL of
agarose were pipetted onto the cell layer and centrifuged. See
figure 2 for the layer structure of the phantoms.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
All examinations were performed in a clinical 3T MRI scanner
(Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The phantoms
where placed in the center of the used coil parallel to the z-axis of
the magnetic field. Imaging parameters of the pulse sequences are
listed in Table 1. SWI sequences were processed by vendorspecific
software of the MRI scanner (Syngo B15, Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) and analyzed. Parameters for image contrast
were set according to recommended settings [31].
Analysis Group A
Images were analyzed by 4 radiologists with 3 to 16 years of
diagnostic MRI experience and blinded for MSC number, agarose
phantom and sequence type. The radiologists were asked to rate
whether the images showed signal alterations attributable to
labeled MSC based on their experience, i.e. if labeled MSC were
detectable in a given image or not, by using a four step scale: 1
‘‘detectable’’, 2 ‘‘probably detectable’’, 3 ‘‘probably not detectable
’’, 4 ‘‘not detectable’’. By calculating the mean of the values of
the individual raters a score was established, hereafter referred to
as the blinded rater value (BRV). For a BRV of 1 to 1.25 an image
was classified as definitely containing labeled cells, for a BRV of
3.25 to 4 an image was classified as definitely not containing
labeled cells. All other BRVs were interpreted as unsure. The
inter-rater reliability was determined with Cohen’s Kappa. Group
comparisons were performed to evaluate the influences of the
sequence type, the slice thickness of the sequence and the number
of labeled cells. Testing for significance was conducted using the
Mann-Whitney-U test. P-values ,0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Analysis Group B
Images were analyzed semiquantitatively and interpreted
independently. A standardized circular region of interest (ROI)
of 4.0 cm2 was placed in the center of each acquired image and
the mean signal intensity in grey values was determined. The
values were imported into a statistic software (see below) for
further analysis. The images of a given sequence were recorded on
the x-axis in subsequent order and the corresponding signal
intensities on the y-axis resulting in curves with each data point of
the curve being a mean signal intensity of a specific image of a
sequence. The resulting curves were fitted before further
comparison to remove systemic artifacts caused by sequence,
gradient, and field inhomogeneities. At first, the values of labeled
MSC bearing slices were removed from the data and the
remaining curve of the residuals was fitted with a fourth grade

from group A at different cell concentrations and with different pulse sequences. The cell concentrations are indicated in the top row, the pulse
sequences are indicated on the left according to Table 1. In sequence A1, the sequence with the highest sensitivity, a clear signal loss can bee seen at
cell concentrations of 500, whereas the other sequences do not show any signal loss at this concentration. There is also some signal loss at 100 cells.
Between the T2* sequence (A5) and a SWI sequence at the same voxel size (A2) no obvious difference can be seen, although the T2* weighted
sequence was rated slightly more sensitive than the SWI sequence.

polynomial (Y = A+B*X+C*X2+D*X3+E*X4). The values of this
fitted curve were subtracted from the values of the original curve,
i.e. the values of the mean signal intensities including the labeled
MSC bearing slices (see Figure 3). This resulted in a straightening
of the curve to allow further comparison of the sequences. From
this straightened curves the mean, the standard deviation, and the
0.95 confidence interval of the residuals were calculated. A
significant loss of signal intensity was recorded for values being
negatively outside the confidence interval.
An additional index was calculated to further analyze the data
for the presence of artifacts in individual sequences, and the
relationship of peaks induced by labeled cells versus peaks induced
by artifacts. This ‘‘signal intensity versus artifact’’-index (SIvA) is
intended as a measure of the ratio between the signal intensity of
labeled MSC bearing slices and the mean signal intensity of
artifact related peaks. It was calculated for every peak of cell
labeled slices by dividing this individual peak by the mean of all
peaks caused by artifacts.
ROI placement and signal intensity readout was performed in
Osirix 3.8 (Osirix, Geneva, Switzerland). All statistical analysis and
all graphs were done with the software Prism 4 (Graphpad
Software, La Jolla, California, USA).
Results
The results of both groups are listed in Table 2, MR images of
selected pulse sequences can be found in Figure 4 for results of
group A and in Figure 5 for results of group B.
In group A the inter-rater reliability of the four raters was fair to
good (Cohen’s Kappa 0.4–0.7) [32]. 100,000 labeled MSC could
be detected in all sequences (BRV = 1). 10,000 MSC could be
detected with SWI sequences using the 8 channel coil at 0.6 mm
and 0.15 mm slice thickness, and with the 12 channel coil
deploying a T2* weighted sequence at 0.7 mm slice thickness.
1,000 labeled MSC could be detected with the 8 channel coil with
SWI at a slice thickness of 0.15 mm and with the T2* weighted
sequences with both, the loop coil and the 12 channel coil, at 0.4
and 0.7 mm slice thickness. 500 labeled MSC could be detected by
SWI using the 8 channel coil at 0.15 mm slice thickness. However,
this sequence/coil combination also showed a false positive result
in one slice without labeled MSC (data not shown). Comparing the
BRVs at different slice thicknesses revealed a significantly lower
BRV at 0.15 mm compared to 0.4 mm (p = 0.0381), 0.7 mm
(p = 0.0429), and 1.2 mm (p = 0.0411) regardless of the sequence
technique used and of the number of labeled cells (Figure 6a).
Significantly lower BRVs were found for layers containing 100,000
Figure 5. Representative phantom MR images for evaluation of the detection limit, images of Group B. Cross sectional images of results
from group B at different cell concentrations and with different pulse sequences. The cell concentrations are indicated in the top row, the pulse
sequences are indicated on the left according to Table 1. A diffuse signal loss at a concentration of 500 cells can be seen in B9. In B11 the signal loss at
500 cells is not obvious at inspection. Both sequences were rated sensitive for a concentration of 500 cells by ROI analysis. The higher resolution of B9
can be easily identified. The main differences between these sequences are in-plane resolution and the averages, and therefore the scanning time.
Comparing B9 and B1 (8 channel knee coil and 12 channel head coil) B1 appears to be noisier although the imaging parameters remain the same. In
some slices an apparently irregular shape of the container can be noted. This is due to small air inclusions at the side of the gel bloc that result in
signal voids melting with the black background. The actual form, size and material of the container was the same in all phantoms.

The grouping is the same as in Table 1. Detectability of a certain amount of labeled MSC with a certain sequence is indicated by ‘‘yes’’ with the BRV (group A) or the SIvA
(group B) in brackets. In group A a BRV of A or 1.25 indicates that MSC were reliably detectable. In group B MSC were recorded as detectable when the peak was outside
the 0.95 confidence interval. The SIvA in group B indicates the intensity of the signal drop of a specific peak in comparison with the mean signal drop induced by
artifacts. (n.a. = not applicable, this MSC quantity was not measured with this sequence). 500 labeled MSC could be detected with sequences B9, B11 and A1 with the 8
channel coil (‘‘Knee’’ coil). The loop coil measurements were used as a reference only since it was not thought to be applicable in large animal scanning.

In group B 100,000 labeled MSC and 10,000 labeled cells led to
a significant loss of signal intensity in all sequences. 5,000 labeled
MSC led to a significant signal loss in all sequences (except B7, B8,
B12, B15, and B17. In layers containing 1,000 labeled MSC a
significant signal loss could be measured in B1, B9, B11, B13, and
B14. 500 labeled MSC could be detected with sequences B9 and
B11. Graphs of the individual results of each sequence are shown
in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The SIvA values (Figure 9) in SWI were
significantly higher for layers containing 100,000 and 10,000
labeled MSC compared to layers containing 5,000 (p = 0.0140 and
p = 0.00140) or 1,000 (p = 0.0121 and p = 0.0485) labeled MSC.
T2* weighted imaging led to a significantly higher SivA in layers
containing 100,000 labeled cells compared to layers containing
5,000 labeled MSC (p = 0.0485). In SWI, there was a tendency
towards a higher SIvA without statistical significance.
Discussion
By deploying two independent experimental approaches we
could demonstrate that an amount of 500 VSOP labeled MSC
embedded in an agarose layer phantom can be reliably detected
with MRI in an experimental setup that is suitable for application
in large animal models, for example in sheep. The applied SWI
showed a slightly higher sensitivity than T2* imaging at a
comparable spatial resolution.
MSC were labeled with VSOP belonging to the SPIO group.
SPIO are the most frequently reported particles for cell labeling,
mainly due to their good biocompatibility and the possibility to
control their magnetic characteristics by changing the size of both
the core and the cover [11]. Special characteristics of VSOP are
the very good cellular uptake and the lower cytotoxicity compared
to normal USPIO [28,33]. Concerning the detectability of SPIO,
as low as 500 cells could be detected in former experimental MRI
examinations performed in small animal models using dedicated
small animal scanners at 4.7 T to 7 T [34–36]. A detection limit of
100 embryonic stem cells labeled with VSOP, the same particles as
used in our study, could be found after intracerebral implantation
in mice with T2* weighted sequences in a dedicated small animal
MRI scanner at 17.6T [29]. The same authors were able to show a
linear signal loss due to accumulation of labeled stem cells at the
border of cerebral infarctions in mice 48 hours after induction of
the ischemia and after systemic application of VSOP labeled
murine mononuclear cells in splenectomized mice at 7 T with T2*
weighted sequences in a dedicated small animal scanner [17].
These detection limits are lower than the detection limit found in
our study.
Figure 7. Results of the ROI based evaluation of examinations with the 12 channel coil. Results obtained by using SWI (phantoms B1 to
B4) and T2* (phantoms B5 to) sequences are listed separately. According to Figure 3, on the x-axis the individual slices of the phantoms are
represented consecutively, with the mean signal intensity for each slice on the y-axis (the actual axes have been removed to make the figure more
clear). The dashed lines represent the 0.95 confidence interval, the straight lines represent the mean signal intensity. The amount of labeled MSC per
layer is indicated for each graph in numbers below the graph. The graphs represent the changes of the mean signal intensity with each data point
representing the mean signal intensity measured in a particular slice. Sequences with a lower slice thickness (i.e. better resolution of data points)
depict the signal loss due to labeled MSC better than sequences with a higher slice thickness (i.e. B1 vs. B8). A similar slice thickness leads to a
relatively great similarity of the performance of T2* and SWI sequences (i.e. B1 vs. B5). These graphical results are also noted quantitatively in Table 2.
There are positive and negative peaks present in regions below the 100 cells layer (i.e. B2 or B5). These are artificial peaks due to inhomogeneities of
the phantoms in the 0 cell layer and in the 100,000 non labeled MSC layers.

We identified two main reasons for this: First, the different
experimental setup and the therefore lower field strength. The
purpose of our examinations was the evaluation of the detection
limit for VSOP labeled stem cells for the application in a large
animal model. Therefore, we used a large bore clinical MRI
scanner with coils applicable in larger animals but with lower field
strength as in dedicated small animal scanners. Second, the length
of anesthesia is crucial for the safe examination of large animals
and therefore is a limiting factor. The resolution of the MR image
with a signal to noise ratio still allowing for unambiguous
identification of cells as determined by the field of view and the
acquisition matrix is highly depending on the field strength and
scanning time. However, the latter is limited and the ideal
sequence for animal scanning can only be a compromise of
acceptable image quality and scanning time [37]. We introduced
SWI, a rarely applied sequence type for this purpose, to
compensate these drawbacks. Our examinations revealed a shorter
scan time with SWI for the same detection limit as compared to
T2* weighted sequences. In SWI the phase information, normally
discarded in T2* weighted images, is used to achieve a higher
sensitivity for susceptibility induced signal changes. The sensitivity
of SWI for iron deposits, microbleeds and calcifications is therefore
known to be higher in comparison to T2* weighted imaging
[22,38]. However, as it is the case with T2* weighted imaging,
SWI sequences cannot specifically detect iron nanoparticles.
Eibofner et al. applied SWI at 1.5 T for the detection of SPIO
labeled cells in agarose phantoms and in a liver model generating a
positive contrast by the use of a specific image post-processing
algorithm. They were able to detect about 1,000 labeled cells in an
agarose phantom, which is a little less sensitve than our results
[25].
Even though this study was not aimed at revealing the optimal
setup of sequence parameters, one of the most sensitive SWI
sequences was performed within 41 minutes (Table 1 and 2). The
imaging parameters most crucial for the specific contrast (TR, TE,
flip angle) were set according to the literature [31]. Therefore the
main differences between the individual sequences, within the T2*
or the SWI group, are voxel size and scanning time. Scanning
times of up to 4 hours have been reported feasible also in
spontaneously breathing sheep early after stroke induction without
harming the animal [19,26]. It may be speculated that even longer
scan times are possible by using MR-compatible ventilation,
allowing for a more reliable anesthesia and better control of
physiological parameters. Thus, the detection limit may even be
enhanced. This does not necessarily mean that scanning times of
4 h hours or beyond are recommendable, but places a scanning
time of 40 min within reasonable margins. It must however be
noted that the difference in the settings between SWI and T2*,
especially of the difference in TR, not only influence image quality
but also have a strong influence on the examination time and
therefore differences in examination time apparent in this study
might be reducible by further parameter optimization, especially
of TR. A systemic testing of all individual parameter combinations
Figure 8. Results of the ROI based evaluation of examinations with the 8 channel coil. As in Figure 7 results obtained by using SWI
(phantoms B9 to B12) and T2* (phantoms B13 to B16) sequences are listed separately. The form of the graphs is the same as in figure 7. Again
sequences with a lower slice thickness (i.e. better resolution of data points) depict the signal loss due to labeled MSC better than sequences with a
greater slice thickness (i.e. B11 vs. B16). With the knee coil, significant peaks at layers containing 500 labeled MSC could be identified (i.e. B9, see also
table 2).

concerning these aspects as well as their further influence, i.e. on
image quality, was not performed in this study.
Agarose layer phantoms were used because they are considered
more reliable than injection phantoms regarding the simulation of
a possible local cell accumulation after systemic application [29].
On the other hand, layer phantoms may lead to a lower sensitivity
compared with injection phantoms in terms of cell detection.
Furthermore, they are prone to artifacts especially in regions of
transitions between layers due to air bubbles and additional
susceptibility artifacts, that could be seen in our study as well,
making the identification of labeled cells more difficult.
The results of our study suggest that SWI sequences are slightly
superior to T2* sequences for the detection of VSOP labeled cells
in large animal models due to a a slightly higher sensitivity for
labeled cells. The shorter examination time with the SWI
sequences present in our study has to be interpreted with respect
to the different parameter settings and might eventually be
avoided by improvement of the T2* parameters although this was
not systemically tested in this study. Another limitation of our
examinations could result from specific artifacts of the layer
phantoms not present in vivo and therefore leading to an
understimation of the detection limit. On the other hand, artifacts
might be present in vivo that do not exist in a layer model, for
example bleedings [39].
We were able to show a detection limit for VSOP labeled stem
cells that seems to be sufficient for stereotactically implanted cells,
a mode of application potentially relevant for upcoming stem cell
therapies for stroke [16,40]. Further improvements of imaging
sequences may decrease the detection limit to a level sufficient also
for VSOP labeled stem cells after systemic injection in large
animal models.
Conclusion
Improving therapy and outcome of ischemic stroke is a highly
relevant issue and stem cell therapy may become an important
part of it to close the gap between acute interventions such as
thrombolysis and thrombectomy, and post-stroke medical therapy.
Translation of methods to large animal models and stem cell
tracking by imaging will play an important role to better
understand the underlying mechanisms and effects achieved.
Our results demonstrate that stem cell imaging is possible and
sensitive enough in a setup applicable in large animal models of
ischemic stroke and stem cell therapy.
