The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR has been implicated in mediating neuronal apoptosis after injury to the CNS. Despite its frequent
induction in pathologic states, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that regulate p75NTRexpression after injury. Here, we
show that after focal cerebral ischemiain vivo or oxygen–glucose deprivation in organotypic hippocampal slices or neurons, p75NTR is
rapidly induced. A concomitant induction of proNGF, a ligand for p75NTR, is also observed. Induction of this ligand/receptor system is
pathologically relevant, as a decrease in apoptosis, after oxygen–glucose deprivation, is observed in hippocampal neurons or slices after
delivery of function-blocking antibodies to p75NTRor proNGF and inp75NTRandngf haploinsufficient slices. Furthermore, a significant
decrease in infarct volume was noted inp75NTR/mice compared with the wild type. We also investigated the regulatory mechanisms
that lead to post-ischemic induction of p75NTR. We demonstrate that induction of p75NTR after ischemic injury is independent of
transcription but requires active translation. Basal levels of p75NTR in neurons are maintained in part by the expression of microRNA
miR-592, and an inverse correlation is seen between miR-592 and p75NTRlevels in the adult brain. After cerebral ischemia, miR-592 levels
fall, with a corresponding increase in p75NTRlevels. Importantly, overexpression of miR-592 in neurons decreases the level of ischemic
injury-induced p75NTR and attenuates activation of pro-apoptotic signaling and cell death. These results identify miR-592 as a key
regulator of p75NTRexpression and point to a potential therapeutic candidate to limit neuronal apoptosis after ischemic injury.

Introduction
The receptor p75NTR is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily. p75NTRbinds to mature and precursor
neurotrophins (proneurotrophins) and regulates numerous functions
, including neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and
cell death (Lee et al., 2001; Roux and Barker, 2002). p75NTR is expressed
at high levels during development and in the perinatal period
, time frames that coincide with programmed cell death and
axonal pruning in the developing nervous system (Singh et al., 2008;
Yang et al., 2009). p75NTRexpression gradually decreases to reach its
lowest levels in adulthood but is upregulated after injury or with
disease,suchasAlzheimer’sdisease,corticospinalaxotomy,seizures,
and hypo-osmolar stress (Fahnestock et al., 2001;Harrington et al.,
2004; Volosin et al., 2006; Ramos et al., 2007). Reexpression of
p75NTR after injury correlates with cell death, frequently mediated
by proNGF, highlighting the pathologic role of this ligand/receptor
system (Fahnestock et al., 2001;Harrington et al., 2004;Volosin et
al., 2006). Previous studies have noted the incidental induction of
p75NTRin neurons after brain ischemia; however, its specific role in
ischemic injury and the identity of the p75NTR ligand mediating
potential effects are unknown (Park et al., 2000;Jover et al., 2002).
Despite numerous models documenting that injury-induced
p75NTR expression correlates with neuronal apoptosis, little is
known about the regulatory mechanisms that restrict p75NTR
expression in adulthood, or which lead to rapid upregulation
after CNS injury. The p75NTRpromoter resembles a housekeeping
gene, with high CG content and multiple Sp1-binding sites,
and recent studies have documented transcriptional induction of
p75NTRafter hypo-osmolar stress, using a Sp1-dependent mechanism
(Carroll et al., 1995;Huber and Chao, 1995;Ramos et al.,
2007). Although it is not known whether p75NTR is regulated
post-transcriptionally, a prior report has shown that serial truncation
of the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of p75NTR mRNA
leads to increased expression of p75NTR, implicating the regula-

tion of p75NTRat its 3UTR (Krygier and Djakiew, 2001). Regulation
at the 3UTR of p75NTRcould be modulated by noncoding
RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), that control protein translation
by binding to the complementary seed sequences in the
UTRs of their target mRNAs (Bartel, 2004). Since miRNAs are
predicted to target30% of all human genes and ischemic injury
induces marked changes in the cerebral microRNAome, we considered
whether miRNAs participate in the regulation of p75NTRafter
ischemia (Lewis et al., 2005;Jeyaseelan et al., 2008;Tan et al., 2011).
Here, we used experimental models of cerebral ischemiain vitro
andin vivoto explore the regulation and consequences of ischemic
induction of p75NTR. We observe that p75NTR and its ligand
proNGF are rapidly induced in the postischemic neocortex and
that the resulting activation of the proNGF-p75NTR pathway
leads to cell death. We also identify a previously unrecognized
post-transcriptional mechanism of p75NTRregulation through a
microRNA, thus suggesting an approach to limit the postischemic
induction of p75NTRand its pro-apoptotic actions.
Materials and Methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion.All procedures were performed in accordance
with institutional and federal guidelines for the treatment of animals.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal
filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), as described
previously (Abe et al., 2010; Jackman et al., 2011; Hochrainer et
al., 2012). All experiments were performed in male C57BL/6 mice (6–8
weeks) or p75NTR/ mice, which were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane
(1.5–2%), oxygen, and nitrogen, and rectal temperature was monitored
and maintained at37°C. A heat-blunted 6-0 nylon suture was inserted
into the right external carotid artery and advanced along the internal
carotid artery until it obstructed the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The
right common carotid artery was simultaneously ligated. Cerebral blood
flow was monitored in the center of the ischemic territory using transcranial
laser Doppler flowmetry (Periflux System 5010; Perimed) during
the surgery, and only mice with85% flow reduction were included in
this study. The filament remained in place for 35 min and was then
retracted, inducing reperfusion for transient, or left in position for permanent
MCAO. For sham MCAO, mice were anesthetized, and vessels
were visualized and cleared of connective tissue, but no further manipulations
were made. Mice were allowed to recover. Infarct volume (in
cubic millimeters) was quantified 72 h after transient MCAO in cresyl
violet-stained coronal brain sections obtained throughout the infarcted
territory, as described previously (Jackman et al., 2011). Infarct volume
data were corrected for swelling. In other studies, mice were killed after
8 h of permanent MCAO or sham surgery, and two adjacent 1 mm slices
of brain tissue were isolated within the MCA territory (approximately
1.2 to0.8 mm bregma) using a brain matrix. Slices were subsequently
dissected into ipsilateral (damaged) and contralateral cortices.
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Organotypic slice cultures from
hippocampus were prepared according to the technique described previously
(Stoppini et al., 1991). In brief, C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 6 (P6)
were decapitated, the brain was removed, and hippocampi were isolated and
cut into transverse slices of 500m thickness on a McIlwain tissue chopper
(Vibratome). The slices were then cultured on membrane culture inserts
(Millicell CM; pore size, 0.4m; Millipore) in six-well culture plates with 1
ml slice culture media consisting of 50% minimum essential medium
(MEM; with 25 mMHEPES modification), 25% Eagle’s basal medium, 25%
heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mMglutamine, and 0.65% glucose (Sigma-
Aldrich), pH 7.2, per well. All reagents were purchased from (Invitrogen)
unless specified. Cultures were maintained for 14 d at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO
2
, and media were replaced every third day.
Primary hippocampal cultures. Briefly, hippocampi were dissected
from embryonic day 18 (E18) Sprague Dawley rat embryos, cells were
dissociated with 0.05% trypsin, and the cell suspension was plated and
maintained in culture for 5–7 d in vitro (DIV5–7) on poly-D-lysinecoated
dishes in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement penicillin
(100 U/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 1 mM L -glutamine. Mitotic
inhibitor 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the
medium (10M) at DIV2, and the medium was half-changed at DIV4.
Amaxa nucleofection with control or microRNA coding constructs was
performed with the Amaxa Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Lonza). Briefly,
3–5 million E18 rat primary neurons were electroporated on DIV0 with 3
g of indicated plasmid (described below) using the predefined program
O-003 of the Nucleofector II (Lonza), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Nucleofected neurons were plated in medium containing
MEM supplemented with 45% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% sodium pyruvate
, penicillin–streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 0.05 mML -glutamine.
The medium was completely changed 2 h after transfection with Neurobasal
medium consisting of B27 supplement penicillin (100 U/ml), penicillin
–streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 1 mM L -glutamine; maintained in
culture until DIV5; subjected to experimental analysis; and harvested for
protein, RNA, or TUNEL assay. All reagents were obtained from Invitrogen
unless mentioned otherwise.
For function-blocking studies, anti-p75NTR serum REX (Weskamp
and Reichardt, 1991) or AB1554 [Millipore (Gehler et al., 2004)] and
nonimmune rabbit IgG (Millipore) were used at a dilution of 1:100. A
wellcharacterizedfunction-blockingantibodyagainstthepro-domainof
proNGF (Beattie et al., 2002; Harrington et al., 2004) was used to block
proNGF activity at a concentration of 25g/ml in hippocampal slices.

incubated in the same buffer for 10 min. The slices were then transferred
to an OGD chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) and flushed with anoxic gas
(95% N
2
and 5% CO

) at 21 liters/min for 8 min. The chamber was then
sealed and placed in an incubator maintained at 37°C for 30 min. Controls
were rinsed with OGD buffer supplemented with 10 mMglucose and
incubated under normoxic conditions. Primary hippocampal cultures
were similarly subjected to OGD with incubation time prolonged to 1 h.
At the end of OGD, slices and primary neurons were washed in normal
culture medium and incubated under normal culture conditions until
the time of harvest. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless
mentioned otherwise.
Western blot.Tissue was lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation buffer
(50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitor
mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After a 15 min centrifugation step at 4°C,
the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane (Millipore). For blotting, membranes were blocked in
5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
for1hatroom temperature. Membranes were then incubated with the
respectiveprimaryantibodyfor1hatroomtemperatureorovernightat4°C,
and then with the secondary antibody for1hatroom temperature. Three
washes were performed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS after both incubations.
Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk or 4% bovine serum albumin
and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS as follows: rabbit anti-proNGF (Harrington
et al., 2004), rabbit anti-p75NTR(9992, antisera against the p75NTR
intracellular domain), rabbit anti-p75NTR (R&D Systems, against p75NTR

NGF(SantaCruzBiotechnology),rabbitanti-cleavedcaspase-3(CellSignaling
), mouse anti--actin (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-ERK (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.Ten-micrometer cryostat
sections of PFA-fixed brain tissue were rehydrated in PBS and incubated
with a blocking solution consisting of 5% serum of the host of
secondary antibody/0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were then
incubated with the primary antibody against proNGF (pro-domain specific
, 1:100; Harrington et al., 2004) overnight at 4°C. After incubation
with biotinylated secondary antibodies, immunoreactivity was detected
using the VIP Peroxidase Substrate kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Vector Laboratories).
For hippocampal slices and primary neurons, TUNEL assay was
performed with the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system (Pro-

the reaction mix was incubated overnight at 4°C to allow for better
penetration.
Image acquisition for primary neurons and tissue sections was done
with Axio Observer.Z1 (Carl Zeiss). For hippocampal slices, all images
were obtained under identical settings with a 20objective on an LSM
700 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Quantification for
staining was done with ImageJ software.
RT-PCR.Total RNA was isolated from primary hippocampal neurons
or brain tissue in Trizol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions
were performed using the Superscript First Strand cDNA synthesis system
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was amplified
for 40 cycles using Taqman gene expression assays (Applied
Biosystems) for p75NTRand 18S. All reactions were done in triplicate and
normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S. For microRNA analysis, small
RNAs were extracted using the RNA aqueous kit (Ambion/Invitrogen) as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using
microRNA-specific primers (Taqman Microrna Assays) as per the manufacturer
’s protocol. Amplification and data acquisition were done with
an ABI 7900 HT Fast RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with
microRNA-specific primers (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the data
was done with ABI 7700 Prism SDS software. For quantification of microRNA
levels, all reactions were done in triplicate and normalized to
endogenous small RNA U6.
Precursor miRNA and antagomiR vectors. Vectors (pEZX-MR03) expressing
the precursor miR-592 under a CMV promoter or a control
vector were obtained from Genecopiea. Lentiviral plasmids (pEZXMR03
and pEZX-AM03) expressing miR-592 and antagomiR-592, respectively
, with their control vectors were purchased from Genecopiea.
Lentiviral generation and transduction. Lentivirus was packaged by
cotransfection of shRNA vectors with second-generation packaging plasmids
pMD2.G and pCMV-dR8.9 using endofectin (Genecopiea) into
HEK293-FT (ATCC) cells. The medium was changed 24 h later, and the
48 h supernatant was filtered through a 0.45m filter and pelleted by
centrifugation with PEG-IT (System Biosciences). Viral pellets were resuspended
in Neurobasal medium. Primary hippocampal neurons were
infected with lentiviruses on DIV0, and the medium was changed the
following day. Neurons were harvested for analysis on DIV5–7.
Target gene 3UTR luciferase assays.The 3UTR of p75NTRfrom the rat
hippocampus was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5
GCGCGGCCGCACTCACACAGGACTGGGAGCCCCT 3; and reverse,
5GCCTCGAGTTGCTATTTAATGGTCATCATG 3. The2000 bp PCR
fragment containing the 3UTR of p75NTRwas
ligated into the dual luciferase reporter vector
psiCheck2 (Promega). The p75NTR3UTR was
preceded by a renilla luciferase reporter gene,
and the vector also contained a separate cassette
of the Firefly luciferase gene serving as an
endogenous transfection control. The control
vector contained only the two luciferase genes.
293T cells (2 105) were plated in a 24-well

Results
p75NTRis increased after brain ischemia
To determine whether ischemia elicits changes in the levels of
p75NTR, we used oxygen and glucose deprivation in organotypic
hippocampal slice cultures, a well characterizedin vitromodel of
ischemia (Noraberg et al., 2005). Hippocampal slices were subjected
to OGD for 30 min, followed by exposure to normal oxygen
and glucose conditions for 8 h. At this time, analysis of
hippocampal lysates demonstrated elevated levels of p75NTR
when compared with control slices (Fig. 1a,b). A similar result
was observed in primary hippocampal neurons subjected to 60
min of OGD (Fig. 1a,b).
To determine whether the increase in p75NTR also occurred
after cerebral ischemiain vivo, we examined p75NTRlevels in the
brains of male C57BL/6 mice subjected to permanent MCAO or
sham surgery. As the cortex is more susceptible than the hippocampus
to MCAO injury, cortical samples from the ischemic
hemisphere and the contralateral control hemisphere were analyzed.
Immunoblots demonstrate elevated levels of p75NTRin the
ischemic hemisphere at 8 h after occlusion, whereas sham surgery
did not affect the levels of p75NTR(Fig. 1c,d).
It has been shown previously that p75NTR-mediated signaling
leads to activation of caspase-3, contributing to cell death (Wang
et al., 2001). To determine whether the increase in p75NTR after
ischemic injury is pathologically relevant, we subjected organotypic
hippocampal slices from p75NTR haploinsufficient mice or
wild-type littermates to OGD. OGD-induced activation of
caspase-3 was significantly decreased in p75NTR/ slices compared
with wild-type slices (Fig. 2a,b). Furthermore, delivery of

function-blocking antibodies directed
against the extracellular domain led to a
complete rescue of OGD-induced apoptosis
in primary neurons (Fig. 2c,d). To
conclusively evaluate the role of p75NTR
in ischemia, we performed transient middle
cerebralartery occlusion in wild-type and
p75NTR/adult mice. Mice were euthanized
at 72 h after ischemia, and coronal
sections of the brains were stained with
cresyl violet for determination of infarct
volume (Jackman et al., 2011). Infarct volume
was significantly decreased in the
p75NTR/mice (29.27.5 mm3) compared
with the age-matched wild-type
controls (62.3 11.25 mm3)( Fig. 2e,f).
Together, these results highlight the
deleterious effects of ischemia-induced
p75NTR in the neuronal damage that
ensues.
ProNGF is increased after brain ischemia
As the apoptotic actions of p75NTR are
mediated by its interaction with its ligand
proNGF, we investigated whether a coordinate
induction of proNGF occurs after
ischemia. An antibody specific for the
pro-domainofproNGFwasusedtodetect
proNGF of28 kDa (Beattie et al., 2002;
Harrington et al., 2004). Elevated levels of
proNGF were observed in organotypic
hippocampal slices subjected to OGD
when compared with control slices (Fig.
3a,b). Immunoblots probed with an antibody
specific for the mature NGF domain
didnotdetectendogenousmatureNGFin
control slices or after OGD (data not
shown). To provide insight into how ischemia
might selectively increase proNGF,
we analyzed the levels of furin, an intracellular
enzyme known to cleave proNGF to
mature NGF during intracellular trafficking.
In slices subjected to OGD, we observed
a significant reduction in the levels
of furin (Fig. 3a,c), suggesting that impaired
cleavage of proNGF to mature
NGF could contribute to the overall increase in proNGF after
OGD.
Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of cortical
lysates from the ischemic hemisphere after MCAO confirmed the
elevation of proNGFin vivo(Fig. 3d–f). ProNGF was not detectableinthenonischemiccontrolhemisphereoraftershamsurgery
(Fig. 3d,e). In addition, mature NGF was significantly decreased
in the adult cortex after cerebral ischemia (Fig. 3e,g). Consistent
with the results obtained in hippocampal slices, we observed a
concomitant decrease in the levels of furin in the ischemic cortex,
suggesting that postischemic elevation of proNGF may be caused
by decreased processing of the precursor to mature NGF (Fig.
3e,h). To establish whether the increase in proNGF after ischemic
injury activated cell-death pathways, we subjected organotypic
hippocampal slice cultures from ngf haploinsufficient mice or
wild-type littermates to OGD. We observed that OGD-induced
activation of caspase-3 was significantly diminished in the slices
from ngf/ mice, highlighting the pro-apoptotic role of
ischemia-induced proNGF (Fig. 3i,j). Furthermore, we used a
well characterized function-blocking antibody to the prodomain
of proNGF (Beattie et al., 2002;Harrington et al., 2004),
or nonimmune rabbit IgG, to examine the effects of increased
proNGF after OGD. Slices were maintained in the presence of the
antibody for 24 h after OGD. Inclusion of anti-proNGF, but not
nonimmune IgG, resulted in a significant decrease in OGD-
induced apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL analysis (Fig. 3k,l).
Increased expression of p75NTRprotein after OGD occurs in a
post-transcriptional, translation-dependent mechanism
To determine whether the increase after p75NTRprotein in ischemia
is accompanied by changes in mRNA levels consistent with
a transcriptional mechanism, we performed quantitative PCR
(qPCR) for p75NTR mRNA in primary hippocampal neurons
subjected to OGD. Although p75NTR protein was robustly in-

duced8hafterOGDinneurons,therewas
no concomitant elevation in the mRNA at
4 or 8 h after OGD (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the
increaseinp75NTRproteinintheischemic
cortex after MCAO was not associated
with an increase in p75NTR mRNA (Fig.
4b). To determine whether the changes in
p75NTR protein were the result of a posttranscriptional
mechanism, we treated
primary hippocampal neurons with the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D.
Treatment with actinomycin D (0.1 g/
ml) did not decrease the levels of OGD-
induced p75NTR (Fig. 4c,d). However,
similar treatment with the translation
inhibitor cycloheximide (10 M) completely
eliminated the OGD-induced increase
in p75NTR (Fig. 4e,f). Together,
these results indicate that the increase in
p75NTRprotein after ischemic injury does
not require active transcription but is dependent
on active translation.
Endogenous miR-592 regulates the
levels of p75NTR
As the increase in p75NTR after ischemic
injury seems to be a translation-dependent
process, we sought to establish whether
the regulation of p75NTR involves a
microRNA-mediated mechanism. The
rodent and human p75NTR transcripts
have a large 3UTR of 2000 bp. Prior
studies have identified a strong correlation between the length of
the 3UTR of transcripts of several mRNAs and the probability of
its regulation by miRNAs (Cheng et al., 2009). Furthermore, cerebral
ischemia is known to alter the miRNA profile in a spatiotemporal
manner (Jeyaseelan et al., 2008;Tan et al., 2011). Thus,
we considered whether a reduction in the levels of specific miRNAs
after ischemia could contribute to the misregulation of their
target mRNAs, specifically p75NTR. We performed an unbiased
approach to identify miRNAs that are altered by ischemia, using
a microRNA microarray analysis in organotypic hippocampal
slices, 4 and 8 h after OGD (data not shown). miRNAs that were
decreased by at least 50% at both 4 and 8 h after ischemia were
further analyzed through algorithms (miRanda) to identify candidate
miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the 3UTR of
p75NTR.
miR-592 emerged as a candidate, as it was decreased by50%
after OGD in hippocampal slices at both time points examined
and was further predicted to target the 3UTR of p75NTR at a
sequence conserved in mouse, rat, and humans (Fig. 5a). To
assess the role of endogenous miR-592 in the regulation of
p75NTR protein, we transduced primary hippocampal neurons
with lentiviruses producing antagomiR-592 to block the activity
of the endogenous miR-592 or a control scrambled antagomiR.
Transduction with antagomiR-592 led to a significant increase in
the level of p75NTR protein in hippocampal neurons, indicating
that endogenous miR-592 participates in controlling the levels of
p75NTRprotein (Fig. 5b,c).
Interestingly, the levels of miR-592 inversely correlated with
the levels of p75NTRin the developing and early postnatal mouse
brain. p75NTR is most highly expressed in the early postnatal
hippocampus(Yangetal.,2009)andhasbeenshowntobecritical
for the pruning of axons in the developing nervous system (Singh
et al., 2008). Immunoblots for p75NTRin the cortex show that the
levels of p75NTRare highest in the perinatal days (Fig. 5d,e). At 2
weeks after birth, p75NTRprotein levels decline, and this is associated
with a simultaneous drop in the levels of p75NTRmRNA as
assessed by qPCR (Fig. 5f). Therefore, p75NTRlevels in this time
frame are likely to be regulated in part by changes in transcriptional
activity. Interestingly, in the perinatal period, the levels of
miR-592 are low (Fig. 5g). The continued decline in p75NTRprotein
from P14 to its basal levels in the adult (P60) is not accompanied
by a further drop in the levels of p75NTRmRNA (Fig. 5f).
Rather, a robust induction of miR-592 was observed in adulthood
(Fig. 5g), which could contribute to the low levels of expression
of p75NTRin the adult. Together, these observations suggest
that miR-592 contributes to the maintenance of p75NTR at low
baseline levels in the adult noninjured brain.
To confirm that miR-592 regulates p75NTR protein levels by
directly targeting the 3UTR of p75NTR, the 3UTR was amplified
from rat brain and inserted into a dual luciferase plasmid. Coexpression

miRNA in heterologous cells led to significantly decreased luciferase
activity 24 h after coexpression (Fig. 5h), indicating that
miR-592 binds to the 3UTR of p75NTR. This interaction was also
confirmed to be specific at the predicted binding sites, as mutations
at these sites on the p75NTR3UTR abolished the effect of miR-592
on luciferase levels. miR-592 did not affect the luciferase levels of a
control empty vector lacking the p75NTR3UTR (Fig. 5h).
miR-592 regulates the induction of p75NTRin neurons after
ischemic injury and contributes to cell death
Quantitative PCR confirmed a significant reduction in the levels
of miR-592 coinciding with the induction of p75NTR after
MCAO, but not sham surgery (Fig. 6a). To determine whether
overexpression of miR-592 in primary neuronal cultures can attenuate
the increase in OGD-induced p75NTR, we transfected
primary hippocampal neurons with precursor miRNA-592.
Transfection with miR-592 but not the control scramble miRNA
significantly decreased the levels of basal p75NTR. Furthermore,
overexpression of miR-592 attenuated the OGD-induced increase
in p75NTRprotein (Fig. 6b,c). In addition, overexpression
of miR-592 levels also significantly attenuated the OGD-induced
activation of caspase-3 in primary hippocampal neurons (Fig.
6d,e). Quantification of apoptotic cells 24 h after OGD showed a
significant protective effect by miR-592 in primary hippocampal
neurons (Fig. 6f).
MicroRNAs can alter protein expression by binding to the
3UTR of their target mRNA to regulate translation either by
cleavage and degradation of the target mRNA, or by repression of
translation (Bartel, 2004). To distinguish between these actions,
we transfected primary hippocampal neurons with miR-592,
which led to a significant decrease in p75NTR protein without a
concomitant decrease in the levels of p75NTR mRNA (Fig. 6g).
This observation suggests that miR-592 likely acts by inhibiting
p75NTR translation, possibly at its initiation or postinitiation
stage. In summary, these findings suggest that deregulation of
miR-592 after injury leads to enhanced translation of p75NTR.
Discussion
In the current study, we identify that miR-592 maintains basal
levels of p75NTRin neurons and that after ischemic injury, miR-
592 levels decline, likely releasing p75NTR mRNA from translational
repression, thus contributing to the postischemic
induction of p75NTR. We also demonstrate that modulation of
the levels of miR-592 in neurons attenuates induction of p75NTR
after injury and the apoptotic cell death that ensues.
Although p75NTRis rapidly induced in several injury models,
few mechanisms have been identified that regulate its gene expression.
A previous study has identified that O-GlcNAcylation
of the Sp1 transcription factor regulates p75NTRtranscription in
hypo-osmolar injury (Ramos et al., 2007; Kommaddi et al.,
2011). The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF- have
also been shown to contribute to p75NTR upregulation after seizures
(Choi and Friedman, 2009). In these two models of injury,
the increase in p75NTR protein was accompanied by an increase
in p75NTR mRNA, indicating transcriptional regulation of the
gene. However, other studies analyzing p75NTR levels in tumor
models have reported that altered p75NTRprotein levels are associated
with a change in polysomal loading without affecting
mRNA levels, implicating a translation-based mechanism
(Provenzani et al., 2006). Our studies show that ischemic injury
induces p75NTR without affecting its transcription, as evidenced
by the lack of change in p75NTR mRNA after ischemia. Furthermore
, blockade of transcription fails to decrease injury-induced
p75NTR elevation. On the contrary, we show that active translation
is necessary for ischemia-induced elevation of p75NTR.
The 3UTR of an mRNA is a key regulator of translation,
through modulation of mRNA localization, poly-adenylation,
and stability, which occur in part through interaction with RNAFigure

binding proteins and/or microRNAs (Barrett et al., 2012). A prior
report has shown that serial truncation of the 3UTR of p75NTR
leads to significantly higher levels of p75NTRprotein, thus implicating
regulation of p75NTR by its 3UTR (Krygier and Djakiew,
2001). The relatively large size of the 3UTR of p75NTR(2 KB)
suggests that it may be regulated at the UTR by numerous interacting
factors including miRNAs. Our study is the first to report
the regulation of p75NTRby a microRNA. However, as p75NTR
is induced in multiple models of neuronal injury and prior
studies have demonstrated that numerous microRNAs are dynamically
regulated after CNS injury, it is possible that additional
microRNAs could also participate in the regulation of p75NTR
(Bhalala et al., 2013).
miRNAs are spatiotemporally regulated in the nervous system
during development (Kapsimali et al., 2007). p75NTR is also differentially
expressed during development, with the highest levels
being in the embryonic and early postnatal periods, consistently
decreasing over time in the adult brain. Interestingly, our observations
show that, correspondingly, miR-592 is low in the perinataldayswhenthepeakexpressionofp75NTRisseen.miR-592is
expressed severalfold higher in the adult brain, correlating with
the low presence of p75NTR. A previous study has identified
region-specific differences in the levels of miR-592 in the adult
rodent brain (Shu et al., 2013). However, further study will be
required to determine whether these levels inversely correlate to
the highly restricted regional localization of p75NTR in adulthood.
In addition, miR-592 has been previously reported to be
differentiallyexpressedinseveraltumors,anditisplausiblethatit
responds similarly to tumor hypoxia, thereby modulating the
effects of p75NTR in tumors (Sarver et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2012a,b).
The altered levels of miR-592 have important consequences in
the nervous system through modulation of p75NTR expression.
miR-592 is located in the intron of mGluR8, a metabotropic
glutamate receptor widely expressed in the brain (Niswender and
Conn, 2010). Intronic miRNAs can be transcribed either as part
of their host genes or independently under the control of their
own promoter (Monteys et al., 2010). Alternatively, the levels of
miR-592 may be regulated at a post-transcriptional stage wherein
the miRNA processing or mature miRNA stability is altered during
injury.
The concomitant postischemic induction of the ligand
proNGF is conducive to the pro-apoptotic actions of p75NTR.
ProNGF is selectively increased after ischemic injury, with a corresponding
decrease in mature NGF. Whereas a transcriptional
response of thengfgene cannot be ruled out, altered processing of
proNGF may also contribute to the selective elevation of proNGF.
Indeed, after seizures, a decline in the activity of MMP-7, an enzyme
known to regulate theextracellular cleavage of proNGF, has been
shown to contribute to the increase in proNGF (Le and Friedman
, 2012). The intracellular processing enzyme furin has been
similarly shown to regulate the balance between proNGF and

mature NGF (Seidah et al., 1996). We report here that the elevation
of proNGF in ischemic injury likely results from a drastic
decrease in the levels of soluble furin. Previous studies have reported
an increase in the mRNA for furin after ischemia, which is
possibly driven by positive feedback because of the decreased
postischemic activity of furin (Yokota et al., 2001).
Although several models of CNS injury have implicated the
pathophysiologic role of proNGF and p75NTRin mediating neuronal
apoptosis, this report is the first to document the effect of
this pro-apoptotic complex in a model of a major form of death
and disability in humans, ischemic stroke. This is significant particularly
because measures to control delayed damage through
apoptosis may be critical in salvaging the ischemic penumbra
(Moskowitz et al., 2010). As proNGF is also known to bind
p75NTRto affect neuronal morphology, it is conceivable that the
effects of their accumulation extend beyond cell death to alter
neuronal morphology and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain
(Deinhardt et al., 2011).
Our findings elicit further interest in the post-transcriptional
regulation of p75NTR. Future studies directed at elucidating the
biogenesis of miR-592 in development and disease will be crucial
to our understanding of p75NTRregulation. As our observations
have identified the detrimental role of miR-592 in ischemia
through p75NTR, modulation of miR-592 is a putative therapeutic
strategy to limit ischemic damage.
