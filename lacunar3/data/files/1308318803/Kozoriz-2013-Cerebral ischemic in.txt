Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease that results in visible developmental
anomalies of the limbs, face, eyes and teeth. Recently analysis of human connexin43 (Cx43)
DNA sequences has revealed a number of different missense, duplication and frame shift mutations
resulting in this phenotype. A mouse model of this disorder has been created with a missense point
mutation of the glycine amino acid at position 60 to serine (G60S). Heterozygoteþ/G60S mice exhibit a
similar ODDD phenotype as observed in humans. In addition to the malformations listed above, ODDD
patients often have neurological findings. In the brain, Cx43 is highly expressed in astrocytes and has
been shown to play a role in neuroprotection. We were interested in determining the effect of the þ/
G60S mutation following stroke. Four days after middle cerebral artery occlusion the volume of infarct
was larger in mice with the þ/G60S mutation. In astrocyte-neuron co-cultures, exposure to glutamate
also resulted in greater cellular death in theþ/G60S mutants. Protein levels of Cx43 in the mutant mouse
were found to be reduced when compared to the normal tissue. Cx43 protein was observed as a
continual line of small punctate aggregates in the plasma membrane with increased intracellular
localization, which is distinct from the larger plaques seen in the normal mouse astrocytes. Functionally,
primary þ/G60S astrocytes exhibited reduced gap junctional coupling and increased hemichannel activity
, which may underlie the mechanism of increased damage during stroke.

1. Introduction
Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) was first described by
Meyer-Schwickerath et al. (1957) and further defined by Gorlin
et al. (1963). Common external features in this syndrome include
ocular, nasal, dental and digital abnormalities (Paznekas et al.,
2009). It is now known that this syndrome is caused by mutation
of the gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43).
Currently, 62 different Cx43 mutations have been identified in
ODDD patients, and in the majority of cases the mutation is
dominant (Paznekas et al., 2009).
Cx43 is expressed in numerous tissues and plays an important
role in cellular communication. Cx43 proteins oligomerize into
hexamers to form connexons, which are inserted into the plasma
membrane of single cells to form hemichannels, or coupled to the
connexons in neighboring cells to form gap junction channels that
provide cytoplasmic continuity between cells (Sáez et al., 2003).
The effect of ODDD Cx43 mutations has been studied by several
groups and in general these mutants show reduced gap junction
formation and increased hemichannel activity (Dobrowolski et al.,
2007; McLachlan et al., 2005). Also, mutated Cx43 often exerts a

dominant-negative effect by reducing normal Cx43 function
(McLachlan et al., 2005). However, recent studies have suggested
that gap junction coupling and hemichannel activity are not
affected in G60S ODDD astrocytes (Wasseff et al., 2011) and C6
glioma cells expressing some ODDD mutations (Gutmann et al.,
1991; Lai et al., 2006).
In the brain, Cx43 is highly expressed in astrocytes, and understanding
the effect of the ODDD Cx43 mutations on astrocytes
remains to be clarified. There is reason to believe that mutations
of Cx43 have an effect on the nervous system as ODDD patients
often have neurological symptoms including ataxia, dysarthria,
neurogenic bladder, seizures and spastic paraparesis (Flenniken
et al., 2005; Gutmann et al., 1991; Loddenkemper et al., 2002).
We have previously shown that disruption of Cx43 leads to
increased infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) (Kozoriz et al., 2010;Nakase et al., 2004;Siushansian
et al., 2001), however the effect of an ODDD mutation in ischemia
is not known. In this study we were interested in determining if
cellular susceptibility to stroke is altered in a mouse with a þ/
G60S point mutation that exhibits an ODDD phenotype
(Flenniken et al., 2005). We examined infarct volume following
MCAO and neuronal death in a neuron-astrocyte co-culture
preparation. We also assessed the pattern of astrocytic Cx43
expression, gap junction coupling and hemichannel activity.
Taken together, the results of our study indicate that theþ/G60S
Cx43 mutation results in reduced astrocytic gap junctional
communication and enhanced hemichannel activity; both of these
could contribute to impaired neuroprotection.
2. Material and methods
All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established
by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by The University of
British Columbia Animal Care Committee. All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to utilize alternatives toin vivo
techniques.
2.1. ODDD mice and MCAO
Mice from a C57BL/6 genetic background were bred with heterozygote mice
harboring a þ/G60S point mutation (GjaJrt/þ strain) (Flenniken et al., 2005). The
mice used in this study were obtained from the Centre for Modeling Human
Disease, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto
Centre for Phenogenomics, Toronto, ON Canada. They were on a FVB/NJ (25%),
C3H/HEJ (25%) and C57BL/6 (50%) genetic background. In this manuscript, wildtype
refers to Cx43þ/þ mice while þ/G60S refers to the autosomal dominant
Cx43Jrt/þ mutant. Genotyping for endogenous and þ/G60S Cx43 has been previously
described (Flenniken et al., 2005; Naus et al., 1997). The MCAO surgery was
performed as previously described by our lab (Nakase et al., 2003, 2004;
Siushansian et al., 2001). In brief, mice aged 8e10 weeks were anaesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg intraperitoneally; MTC Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge
, Canada). The mice were secured to a 37 C heating pad in a sterotaxic
frame, a skin incision was made and the squamosal bone was exposed by
retracting the temporalis muscle. A burr hole was made over the middle cerebral
artery and the dura mater was pierced with a needle. The MCA was then occluded
above and below the rhinal fissure by electrocautery. The skin incision was closed
with sutures and the mice were kept in a cage warmed on a 37 C heating pad
until regaining consciousness.
2.2. Infarct volume
For this study a total of four mice for each genotype were used. Infarct volume
was assessed as described in our previous studies (Kozoriz et al., 2010;Nakase et al.,
2004; Siushansian et al., 2001). Four days after MCAO mice were deeply anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and were transcardially
perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by perfusion with
10% formalin (SigmaeAldrich, Oakville, Canada). Brains were removed and stored in
10% formalin and the next day were cryoprotected in a 10% formalin/30% sucrose
solution. Brain sections, 20 mm thick, were collected every 100 mm, and mounted
sequentially on glass microscope slides. To quantify infarct size sections were
stained with 0.125% thionin (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) and the volume of
infarct was measured by adding together the lesion area in each of the serial
sections.
2.3. Astrocyte cultures
Astrocyte cultures from both wild-type and ODDD mice were prepared from 0 to
1 day old pups (Kozoriz et al., 2010;Ozog et al., 2002). Neocortices were dissected in
PBS and placed in culture medium consisting of high glucose Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Corp., Burlington, Canada) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), 10 U/mL penicillin, and 10 U/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen Corp.). Tissue was triturated through a serological pipette and passed
through a 70mm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). Cells were re-suspended in
culture medium and plated on either plastic culture dishes or laminin coated coverslips
and stored in a humidified incubator in 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 C. Medium
changes were performed every 4 days and astrocytes were used between 14 and 21
days in vitro or when 30% confluent for the hemichannel experiments described
below (w5 days).
2.4. Neuron-astrocyte co-culture cytotoxicity assay
Neuron-astrocyte co-cultures were generated as previously described (Ozog
et al., 2002). In brief, cultured astrocytes, prepared as described above, from each
genotype were grown until confluent (10e13 days) in 35 mm plastic culture dishes.
Wild-type neurons (1  106 cells/well) isolated from gestational age day 16 mice
were seeded on top of the astrocyte monolayer. The co-culture media contained 3/5
neurobasal medium, 2/5 DMEM/F12, supplemented with 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 U/
mL streptomycin and B27 supplements (Invitrogen Corp.). Media changes were
performed every 3 days by replacing 2/3 of the solution with fresh co-culture media.
On day 8, co-cultured cells was rinsed with Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS)
and exposed to 1 mM glutamate (SigmaeAldrich, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle in EBSS
for 3 h. Cells were then maintained in co-culture media for 24 h after glutamate/
vehicle exposure. Next, samples of media were collected and frozen for subsequent
analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release using an LDH detection kit (Sigmae
Aldrich). Cell cultures were also exposed to propidium iodide (30 mM in PBS) for
5 min and subsequentlyfixed in 4% formaldehyde solution. The tissue was mounted
with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR).
2.5. Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on cortical tissue or on cultured astrocytes
from each genotype as previously described (Kozoriz et al., 2010; Nakase
et al., 2004; Ozog et al., 2002). Ten mm thick glass mounted sections were rinsed
in PBS and then exposed to 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 2 min
and then rinsed in PBS. Sections were blocked in 7.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
SigmaeAldrich) for 30 min, incubated overnight in 1% BSAePBS and primary
antibody, then washed with PBS (3  10 min) and subsequently incubated for 1 h
with secondary antibody in 1% BSAePBS. Slides were then rinsed 3 times for 10 min
with PBS, dipped in water, and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with
DAPI. Primary antibodies were used at the concentrations indicated: anti-Cx43 C-
terminal (amino acid residues 363e382) antibody raised in rabbit (1:2000 dilution;
SigmaeAldrich; catalog #C6219), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody
raised in mouse (1:1000; SigmaeAldrich; catalog #G3893) and anti-ionized calcium-binding
adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) antibody produced in rabbit (1:500;
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Richmond, VA; catalog #019-19741). Secondary
antibodies consisted of a 1:500 dilution of highly cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (catalog #A-11029 and
#A-11034) or Alexa Fluor 568 (catalog #A-11031 and #A-11036) and were used as
appropriate (Molecular Probes Inc.). Images were obtained using the same exposure
times on a Leica TCS SP5 II Basic VIS system (Leica Microsystems Canada Inc.,
Concord, Ontario, Canada). Identical conditions were used for acquisition of
immunofluorescence images.
Immunocytochemistry on confluent astrocyte cultures was performed using the
same concentration of Cx43 antibodies and secondary antibodies as used on tissue
sections noted above. Astrocytes were rinsed in PBS,fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
rinsed in PBS and then exposed to 0.1% Triton-X-100 PBS (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa,
Canada) for 2 min. After a brief PBS rinse, cells were blocked in 7.5% BSA for 30 min.
Astrocytes were then incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% BSA and primary
antibody, then washed with PBS 3 times for 10 min and incubated for 1 h with a
secondary antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA. Astrocytes were then rinsed 3 times
for 10 min with PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold with DAPI. Images were obtained
using the same exposure times on a Zeiss Axioplan2fluorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss Ltd, Toronto, Canada). Identical conditions were used for acquisition of
immunofluorescence images.
2.6. Western blot
Adult cortical brain tissue and astrocyte cultures were prepared and probed
using standard Western blot protocols (Siushansian et al., 2001). In brief, tissue
was lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (RIPA) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Roche Laval, QC, Canada) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigmae
Aldrich). Samples were extracted with a syringe through a 26 gauge needle,

(WITH PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA protein kit quantification (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Twenty
mg protein samples were boiled for 1 min in RIPA, with the exception of samples
for the Cx26 blot, which were not boiled, and loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide
gel for separation. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline
with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h followed by incubation in a primary antibody (see
below) in 5% milk and TBS-T overnight. The blot was then washed with TBS-T and
was then incubated in secondary antibody (see below) and washed. Proteins were
detected by incubation with Super-Signal chemiluminescent solution (Pierce). To
ensure equal loading of samples, blots were stripped and re-probed for antiglyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primary antibodies were
used at the following concentrations: anti-Cx43 C-terminal (1:5000), anti-Cx26
(1:500; Zymed. San Francisco, CA; catalog #51-2800), anti-Cx30 (1:250; Zymed,
San Francisco, CA; catalog #71-2200) and anti-GAPDH (1:10,000; HyTest, Turku,
Finland; catalog #5G4 MAb 6C5). Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse or antirabbit
horseradish peroxidase-tagged, were used at a 1:3000 dilution (Sigma;
catalog #A6154 and #A8924).
2.7. Gap junction coupling
To assess gap junction coupling, cells were incubated with 50 mL of the gap
junction permeable dye carboxyfluorescein (0.1%) and gap junction impermeable
dye dextran-rhodamine (0.1%; 10 kDa) (Molecular Probes Inc., Burlington, ON,
Canada) in PBS. Dye entry was induced by scraping a confluent monolayer of astrocytes
with a scalpel blade and allowing the dyes to incubate for 2 min. Excess dye
was washed off with several rinses of PBS. Carbenoxolone (20mM) in PBS was added
to inhibit further coupling. The extent of coupling was determined by measuring the
average distance traveled by carboxyfluorescein from the dextran-rhodamine
labeled cells at the scape edge.
2.8. Hemichannel assay
Hemichannel activity was examined using two methods. First, using a propidium
iodide uptake assay (Kozoriz et al., 2010), cells were washed with Hank’s
buffered salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen Corp.) with Ca2þ and then incubated in
HBSS with or without Ca2þ containing 1.5 mM propidium iodide for 15 min. Astrocytes
were then washed with HBSS, fixed and mounted with ProLong Gold
antifade reagent containing DAPI for subsequent analysis. A second assay examined
hemichannel activity by dye uptake and time-lapsefluorescence imaging (Orellana
et al., 2010). Cells plated onto glass coverslips were washed twice with Locke’s solution
containing (in mM) 154 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2.3 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, at pH 7.4 and
incubated in 5 mM ethidium bromide (Etd). In some experiments Ca2þ/Mg2þ free
medium was used. Phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy with time-lapse
imaging were used to record cell appearance and fluorescence intensity changes
in each condition. Images of Etd uptake were analyzed with the Image J software
(NIH software). To test for changes in slope, regression lines were fitted to points
before and after various treatments and mean values of slopes were compared using
GraphPad Prism software. Lanthanum ion (La3þ; 200 mM) and carbenoxolone
(25 mM) were also applied in some experiments to test the specificity of hemichannel
openings versus cellular death.
2.9. Data analysis
Results are reported as means  S.E.M. Unless otherwise indicated statistical
comparisons were performed using a Student’s t-test with a P value of <0.05
considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Cerebral infarct volume in þ/G60S mice
Given the importance of Cx43 in neuroprotection following
stroke (Kozoriz et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2008; Nakase et al., 2004;
Siushansian et al., 2001) we were interested in determining if aþ/
G60S mutation alters the extent of ischemic injury following MCAO.
Theþ/G60S mutation has been reported to affect gap junction and
hemichannel activity (Manias et al., 2008), therefore we anticipated
there should be an increase in neuronal ischemic injury in a stroke
model. Both wild-type and þ/G60S mice were subjected to MCAO
and infarct volume was assessed 4 days later. þ/G60S mice had

mice. B, The volume of the infarct in þ/G60S mice is significantly larger than the wild-type (*P< 0.05).
Fig. 2. Excitotoxic neuronal cell death is increased in þ/G60S neuron-astrocyte cocultures.
A, Cellular death was evaluated by measuring LDH released into the extracellular
media and comparing it to LDH within intact cells. The fraction of LDH release
was greater in co-cultures from both genotypes exposed to glutamate in comparison to
vehicle. Following glutamate exposure, the extent of cell death was greater inþ/G60S
co-cultures in comparison to Cx43þ/þ cells (*P < 0.05; n ¼ 6 in all groups). B, Cell
viability was also assessed by measuring the ability to extrude propidium iodide
(PI). þ/G60S co-cultures had a larger increase in PI iodide labeled cells following
exposure to glutamate in comparison to wild-type (*P< 0.05; n ¼ 6 in all groups).

significantly larger infarct volumes in comparison to wild-type
indicating there was greater damage in þ/G60S mutants (Fig. 1).
We next examined the possible mechanisms for this enhanced
injury in mice expressing theþ/G60S Cx43 mutation.
3.2. Excitotoxic neuronal cell death in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures
To further assess the effect of a þ/G60S mutation on neuronal
injury, we examined the ability of astrocytes to protect neurons
under excitotoxic conditions. Wild-type neurons were plated on a
confluent layer of either wild-type astrocytes or astrocytes carrying
the þ/G60S mutation. These co-cultures were subjected to glutamate
at a concentration and time interval that causes death in a
portion of the neurons. Cell death was determined by measuring
LDH release and neuronal propidium iodide (PI) uptake 24 h after
exposure to glutamate or vehicle. Glutamate exposure increased the
cell death markers compared tovehicle in both genotypes (Fig. 2). In
comparison to wild-type, cell death was increased following

glutamate in þ/G60S astrocyte co-cultures indicating the þ/G60S
mutation again significantly enhanced cell death (Fig. 2).
3.3. Expression pattern of Cx43 in brain tissue and cultured
astrocytes from ODDD mice
We next examined the cellular localization of wild-type and
mutant Cx43, as well as the overall level of Cx43 protein. Immunostaining
of brain sections was carried out for Cx43 and GFAP
(Fig. 3A). For cerebral cortical areas, all sections showed localization
of Cx43 in GFAP-positive cells. However, there was an overall
reduction in the level of Cx43 immunoreactivity in sections fromþ/
G60S mutant mice, as well as reduced gap junction plaque formation
in the astrocytes expressing the þ/G60S mutation. It is also
apparent that considerable Cx43 was localized within the cell
bodies and processes of the þ/G60S mutant astrocytes. We also
examined Cx43 and GFAP in astrocyte cultures prepared from þ/
G60S mutant mice (Fig. 3B). Here, we also observed reduced plaque
formation with an increase in Cx43 localization in cytoplasmic
compartments of þ/G60S mutant astrocytes. In addition, we
observed more diffuse localization of Cx43 along the plasma
membrane ofþ/G60S astrocytes.
Western blots were performed on samples obtained from
astrocyte cultures and cortical brain tissue from both genotypes
(Fig. 4). Cx43 bands were observed in both genotypes, however a
reduction in the upper band (phosphorylated Cx43) was observed
both in cortical and astrocyte culture samples (Fig. 4). Because
mutated Cx43 may alter the expression of other connexins we
examined the expression of the other major astrocyte connexin,
Cx30. No difference in Cx30 expression was observed between the
genotypes in adult cortical tissue (Fig. 4). As another group has
shown no decrease in coupling in þ/G60S astrocyte cultures
(Wasseff et al., 2011), we also probed for Cx26 as a possible connexin
which is upregulated in these mutants. However, Cx26 was
not detected in astrocyte cultures from either genotype, but was
clearly detected in samples of mouse mammary tissue (Fig. 4).
3.4. Gap junction coupling and hemichannels activity in culturedþ/
G60S astrocytes
Because gap junctional communication is thought to play a role
in stroke (Kozoriz et al., 2010;Nakase et al., 2004;Rossi et al., 2007;
Siushansian et al., 2001) we sought to determine if coupling was
altered in þ/G60S astrocytes. A confluent monolayer of astrocytes
from both genotypes was scraped in the presence of gap junction
permeable and impermeable dyes. In comparison to wild-type
cultures,þ/G60S cultures had reduced coupling (Fig. 5), indicating
gap junctional communication is reduced in these mutant
astrocytes.
In addition, the hemichannel activity was increased in þ/G60S
cultured astrocytes under Ca2þ and Mg2þ free conditions. This was
demonstrated using propidium iodide uptake (Fig. 6), as well as in
real time with Etd uptake (Fig. 7A). This effect was blocked by La3þ
(200 mM) and carbenoxolone (25 mM) applied during the dye uptake
assay (Fig. 7A), and reduced by preincubation with SB203580
(10 mM), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (Fig. 7B), suggesting the
increased hemichannel activity is dependent upon this kinase.
4. Discussion
The neurological manifestations of ODDD in humans are broad
(Gutmann et al.,1991;Joss et al., 2008;Loddenkemper et al., 2002).
As astrocytes are the primary cell type that expresses Cx43 in the
brain we examined their properties in a þ/G60S mouse model of
ODDD (Flenniken et al., 2005). In astrocytes, Cx43 is known to form
gap junctions and hemichannels which allow for the passage of
ions and small molecules (Chen et al., 2012; Orellana et al., 2011).
The effect of a þ/G60S ODDD mutation has been studied in other
tissues. In ovary granulosa cells gap junction coupling is reduced. In
addition gap junction plaque formation appears to be reduced in
heart, ovary and teeth (Flenniken et al., 2005; Manias et al., 2008;
Toth et al., 2010). Also, in rat epidermal keratinocytes transfected
with þ/G60S Cx43 encoding plasmid, gap junction plaque formation
was sparse and Cx43 was increased in cytoplasmic compartments
(Churko et al., 2010). Our study of þ/G60S brain tissue
largely echoes thesefindings of intracellular compartmentalization,
reduced plaque formation and reduced coupling. Interestingly,
another group has shown that coupling is present, but reduced, in
glioma cells expressing several other ODDD mutations (Lai et al.,
2006).
We also examined hemichannel activity in these mutants and
found that it was higher compared to wild-type. This phenomenon
is associated with reduced coupling, consistent with other studies
showing the activity of hemichannels and gap junction are oppositely
regulated (Contreras et al., 2002; De Vuyst et al., 2007;
Retamal et al., 2007). Although cultured cells, including Cx43
transfected HeLa cells and cortical astrocytes, under resting conditions
show low Cx43 hemichannel activity (Contreras et al., 2002;
Retamal et al., 2007; De Vuyst et al., 2009), basal dye uptake ofþ/
G60S astrocytes was lower with respect to wild-type astrocytes
(Fig. 7B). One explanation could be that these astrocytes have low
levels of Cx43 hemichannels on the surface. Studies in mammary
gland have described that Cx43 mutations related to ODDD induced
a reduction in the levels of Cx43 (Plante and Laird, 2008). Although
Fig. 4. Western blot of protein from adult cortical tissue and astrocyte cultures. A, Protein samples from 4 different adult cortices indicate that the quantity of Cx43 protein in þ/
G60S mice is reduced in comparison to the wild-type, while Cx30 levels remain unchanged. GAPDH served as a loading control. B1, A reduction in expression was also found in
astrocyte cultures (6 different culture preparations shown). The level of phosphorylation of Cx43 is greatly reduced in the þ/G60S mutant mouse as shown by a reduction in the
intensity of the upper bands. B2, The same astrocyte protein samples as in B1 were run on a separate blot to stain for Cx26. No Cx26 was observed in either wild-type orþ/G60S
cultures. Protein from mouse mammary (MAM) tissue loaded at 20 and 60 mg, respectively, served as a positive control for Cx26.

Cx43 levels in the plasma membrane were not determined, we did
observe the lowest levels of total Cx43 inþ/G60S astrocytes (Fig. 4).
Our results showed that þ/G60S astrocytes exhibit an increased
susceptibility to divalent cation removal, which induces hemichannel
opening (Contreras et al., 2002;De Vuyst et al., 2009;Quist
et al., 2000). These results are consistent with studies in transfected
HeLa cells, with Cx43-mutations related with ODDD (G138R, G143S
and I31M) that showed increased hemichannel activity
(Dobrowolski et al., 2007). Moreover, calcium ion-dependent open/
closed conformations in Cx43 hemichannels require the extramembranous
parts of the channel (Thimm et al., 2005). Another

passage through scraped astrocyte cultures. Dextran-rhodamine (red), which is impermeable to gap junctions, labels cells at the scrape site (yellow due to calcein and rhodamine
colocalization). Examples from wild-type (A1) and þ/G60S (A2) cultures are shown. B, A graph quantifying the distance of dye passage demonstrates a reduction in gap junction

possibility is that the þ/G60S mutation (extracellular loop) causes
an altered conformation and changes the intrinsic properties of the
Cx43 hemichannels, changing their sensitivity to calcium ions.
Interestingly, the increase in hemichannel activity was dependent
on p38 MAPK kinase. This kinase is involved in the cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury (Kovalska et al., 2012) and also modulates
the activity of hemichannels (Kim et al., 1999). The hemichannel
activity in ODDD mutants is variable, either shown to
increase, decrease or not change, depending on the particular
mutant under study (Dobrowolski et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2006;
Wasseff et al., 2011). Differences in results may be due to different
genetic backgrounds or dyes used to assess coupling. For example,
there are some differences between our results and those reported
by Wasseff et al. (2011), who also examined the þ/G60S Cx43
mutant in astrocytes. They found no changes in Lucifer yellow dye
passage in þ/G60S vs wild-type astrocytes in brain slices from
GjaJrt/þ mice, or in astrocytes cultured from these mice. However,
when theþ/G60S Cx43 mutant was expressed in N2A cells, which
do not express other connexins, there was no dye passage. Their
immunocytochemistry for Cx43 in þ/G60S mutant astrocytes also
shows increased localization in the membranes, while they show
reduced expression of this mutant Cx43 in spinal cord and cerebellum.
Some of these differences compared to our results are
difficult to explain, but may arise due to strain differences. Wasseff
and collaborators used mice on a C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ genetic
background, while our studies used mice from a different source
with a background of FVB/NJ (25%), C3H/HEJ (25%) and C57BL/6
(50%). With respect to Cx43, there are variable effects following
conditional knockout of Gja1 targeted to the CNS in mice, which
depends on the genetic background (Wiencken-Barger et al., 2007).
In addition to the localization of Cx43 described above, there
were alterations in the phosphorylation state of Cx43 in these
mutants. As discussed by Manias et al. (2008),inþ/G60S cardiac
tissue there was a 60e80% reduction in Cx43 protein and mostly
the highly phosphorylated form of Cx43 was disrupted. It was
determined in this study that Cx43 was retained in the Golgi
apparatus and it was reasoned that Cx43G60S co-oligomerizes with
wild-type Cx43, ultimately affecting wild-type Cx43 trafficking and
keeping it from reaching its phosphorylated state. Ourfindings are
consistent with a decrease in phosphorylation of Cx43G60S in both
cultured astrocytes as well as cerebral cortex.
In this study, we found that þ/G60S astrocytes provide less
neuroprotection in co-cultures with neurons compared to wild
type astrocytes. More importantly, we determined that infarct
volume was increased following MCAO in mice harboring aþ/G60S
mutation. During focal ischemia a necrotic core develops, which is
surrounded by a penumbral region and normal brain tissue. One
theory of how gap junctions can be protective is that astrocytes can
buffer cytotoxic substances in the penumbral region (Contreras
et al., 2004; Rossi et al., 2007). Since coupling was reduced in þ/
G60S astrocytes it is possible that such buffering mechanisms were
compromised during stroke leading to increased infarct volume.
This effect is similar to studies from our lab where a reduction in
Cx43 expression and gap junction coupling led to increased infarct
damage (Kozoriz et al., 2010;Nakase et al., 2004;Siushansian et al.,
2001). Since hemichannel activity promotes astroglial death by
hypoxia-reoxygenation (Orellana et al., 2010), they may also
contribute to increased infarct volume in these mice. The in vivo
results might also be explained, in part, by an increase in hemichannel
activity in other cell types such as microglia that express
Cx43 hemichannels; activated microglia release glutamate and ATP,
causing neurotoxicity (Orellana et al., 2010). These findings may
provide insight into the neurological deficits reported for ODDD
patients (Abrams and Scherer, 2012; Gutmann et al., 1991;
Loddenkemper et al., 2002). To date, due to the rare nature of this
disorder, there is no report regarding stroke incidence and severity
in ODDD patients.
