Lanthionines are novel neurotrophic and neuroprotective small molecules that show promise for the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, a recently developed, cell permeable lanthionine
derivative known as LKE (lanthionine ketimine 5-ethyl ester) promotes neurite growth at low nanomolar
concentrations. LKE also has neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its therapeutic
potential in cerebral ischemia and its mechanisms of neurotrophic action remain to be fully elucidated.
Here, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective actions of LKE could result from induction or
modulation of CRMP2. We found that treating primary cultured mouse neurons with LKE provided significant
protection against t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced neuronal death possibly through CRMP2
upregulation. Similarly, in vivo studies showed that LKE pre and/or post-treatment protects mice against
permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (p-MCAO) as evidenced by lower stroke lesions and
improved functional outcomes in terms of rotarod, grip strength and neurologic deficit scores in treated
groups. Protein expression levels of CRMP2 were higher in brain cortices of LKE pretreated mice, suggesting
that LKE’s neuroprotective activity may be CRMP2 dependent. Lower activity of cleaved PARP-1 and
higher activity of SIRT-1 was also observed in LKE treated group suggesting its anti-apoptotic properties.
Our results suggest that LKE has potential as a therapeutic intervention in cerebral ischemia and that
part of its protective mechanism may be attributed to CRMP2 mediated action and PARP-1/SIRT-1
modulation.

1. Introduction
Lanthionine (Lan) is a nonproteogenic amino acid formed in the
central nervous system (CNS) through the transsulfuration pathway
and possibly through other glutathione-dependent biochemical
pathways (Hensley et al., 2010a). In the mammalian brain, Lan
undergoes aminotransferase conversion to yield an unusual cyclic
thioether, lanthionine ketimine (LK; 2H-1,4-thiazine-5,6-dihydro-
3,5-dicarboxylic acid). LK has been observed to demonstrate
neuroprotective, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory activities
(Hensley et al., 2010b). Recently, a novel cell-permeable derivative,
lanthionine ketimine-ethyl ester (LKE), was shown to protect
NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells from oxidative toxicity mediated
by hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
) and also to promote the growth
factor-stimulated outgrowth of neurites in these cells (Hensley
et al., 2010b, 2011).
One of the most significant events triggered by the loss of blood
supply to the brain during ischemia is axonal injury due to the
imbalance of Na+ and/or Ca2+ influx into axons, which leads to
the breakdown of the cytoskeleton, the final outcome of which is
neuronal degeneration and death. Collapsin response mediator
proteins (CRMPs) are cytoskeleton-regulating proteins expressed
in dendrites, axons and growth cones. CRMPs have important roles,
both developmentally and following axonal damage, as exemplified
by the observation that expression of semaphorin-3A and its
downstream effector CRMP2 was associated with neuronal injury
in the brains of patients with epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
and cerebral ischemia (Gu et al., 2000; Kee et al., 2001).
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, among
several other mechanisms, has been implicated in the oxidative

stress-mediated cell death during ischemic injury. Release of apoptosis
inducing factor (AIF) mediated by PARP-1 also plays a critical
role in the cascade of neuronal loss and death (Alano et al., 2010).
The histone deacetylase sir2 (silent information regulator 2) orthologue
sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1), another NAD+ dependent enzyme, is involved
in regulating energy homeostasis by controlling the
acetylation status and the activities of a number of enzymes and
transcriptional regulators. Since both PARP-1 and SIRT-1 use
NAD+ for their activity, it has been thought that the increased
activity of one molecule might interfere with the activity of the
other.
In the present study, we were interested in evaluating the therapeutic
potential of LKE in stroke and its implications for CRMP2
modulation as well as its ability to modulate the expression of
other proteins involved in the apoptotic process following ischemia
, specifically the PARP-1/SIRT-1 system. This is the first study
to evaluate the role of LKE in delayed ischemic response induced
by permanently occluding the distal part of middle cerebral artery
(p-MCAO).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All animal studies were conducted in accordance to the protocol
approved by The University of Toledo Health Science Campus
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the guidelines
prescribed by the National Institutes of Health. C57BL/6 male (5–
10 weeks old; 25–30 g) and female (timed 17 days pregnant) mice
were procured from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA
and were housed at 22 ± 1C with a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle with
water and food available ad libitum.
2.2. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (p-MCAO)
We used our previously optimized method to occlude the distal
portion of the MCA (Shah et al., 2011). Briefly, mice were anesthetized
with isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL), initially
with 3–5% in the induction chamber and then maintained at 1%
throughout the surgical procedure via the nasal cone. With the
aid of a surgical microscope, a 10 mm vertical skin incision was
made between the right eye and ear, and the underlying temporal
bone was exposed by moving the temporal muscle aside. Accordingly
, a 2.0-mm burr hole was drilled and the distal part of MCA
was occluded directly using a bipolar coagulator, and complete
cessation of blood flow at the occlusion site was confirmed by laser
Doppler flowmetry. Mice having complete cessation of the blood
flow were selected for the study. Rectal temperature was monitored
continuously with a rectal probe and maintained at
37.0 ± 0.5C during the surgery with a heating blanket. After the
surgery, animals were left to recover in a temperature-regulated
recovery chamber before shifting to home cages. No mortality
was observed in this model and all the mice survived.
2.3. Drug treatment
Mice were randomized into different treatment groups, and
personnel working on the study were blinded from the experimental
design. LKE was synthesized as described previously (Hensley
et al., 2010a) and solubilized to 25 mg/mL in physiological saline
by careful titration to neutrality with 2 N NaOH. In the pre-treatment
paradigm, LKE (100 mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle (physiological
saline) was administered for 7 days prior to p-MCAO. In the posttreatment
paradigm, LKE (100 mg/kg) was administered via an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 4 h after the p-MCAO and then daily
for 7 days. This dose was chosen based on the limits of LKE solubility
in saline and reported dose efficacy in a mouse model of ALS
(Hensley et al., 2010b).
2.4. Locomotor activity
Locomotor activity was evaluated by means of a rotarod task by
a person blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were placed on a
horizontal rod (Columbus Instruments, OH) that was made to rotate
at 1 rpm with an acceleration rate of 1 rpm every 10 s until
the animal fell from the rod. Each animal was tested three times
per trial. All the animals were trained on the rotarod assembly
prior to surgery. The duration for which each animal was able to
stay on the accelerating rod was recorded as the latency to fall
and registered manually. Locomotor activity was monitored 4 h
before and 2, 5 and 7 days after p-MCAO surgery.
2.5. Grip strength
Grip strength was evaluated by holding the mice by tails and
placing their forelimbs on a specially designed pull bar assemblies
(Grip strength meter, Columbus Instruments, OH). Peak amount of
force animals exert was displayed on the digital display and noted.
Each animal was tested three times per trial at 4 h before, 2 and
7 days after p-MCAO surgery.
2.6. Neurological deficit scores (NDS)
NDS were evaluated by a 28-point score pattern optimized by
our group (Shah et al., 2011). A person blinded to the treatment
evaluated NDS 7 days after p-MCAO; the evaluation included both
sensory and motor deficits, such as body symmetry, gait, climbing,
circling behavior, front limb symmetry, compulsory circling, and
whisker response. Each of the seven tests included in the 28-point
NDS was graded from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating severe
deficits.
2.7. Infarct volume analyses
Animals from all the groups were euthanized 7 days after
p-MCAO. Brains were dissected out and sliced into five 2-mm-thick
coronal sections before incubating in 1% triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) (Sigma Co., MI). The infarct area was estimated from
five slices of each brain, measuring rostral and caudal sides of each
individual slice in conjunction with the thickness and expressed as
a percentage of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere. A person
blinded to the treatment groups measured the infarct volume
with the help of ImageJ software provided by NIH.
2.8. Western blots
Brain cortices of ischemic and non-ischemic mice were dissected
out, weighed, and homogenized as described previously
(Shah et al., 2011). Protein samples were analyzed by loading
equivalent amounts of protein (25lg) onto 10% SDS–polyacrylamide
gels and incubated with different primary antibodies; rabbit
anti-actin, 1:3000 (Sigma Co., MI); rabbit anti-CRMP2, 1:50,000
(Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti PARP-1, 1:1000 (cell signaling,
Danvers, MA); rabbit anti SIRT-1, 1:1000 (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) and/or rabbit anti histone H3, 1:3000 (ThermoScientific,
Waltham, MA). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software
provided by the NIH. The densitometric values were normalized
with respect to b-actin/histone H3.

2.9. Cell cultures and viability assay
Isolation of embryonic cortical neuronal cells was performed
according to Nada and Shah (2012) with minor modifications.
Timed 17-day pregnant mice were terminated by CO
2
overdose,
and fetuses were decapitated and cortices collected, and centrifuged
at 1000g at 18C for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in fresh
5 mL of DMEM medium (Fisher scientific) containing 0.25% of trypsin
followed by incubation at 37C/5% CO
2
for 15 min. Cells were
then centrifuged and re-suspended in 5 mL of neurobasal medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing penicillin and streptomycin
(50 U/mL of medium), glutamine (2 mmol/L), and B27 serum free
(Invitrogen). This step was repeated twice, after which the cells
were counted using trypan blue and plated onto poly-L-lysine
coated plates. Cultures were maintained at 37C in a 5% CO
2
atmosphere
and all the in vitro experiments were performed after
14 days in culture. Primary cortical neurons were seeded at a population
0.5106 in pre-coated 24-well dishes. Two hours prior to
drug treatment, the neurobasal medium was replaced with the
medium containing B-27 minus antioxidant (Invitrogen). Cells
were pre-treated with LKE with increasing concentrations of
100–500lmol/L for 6 h and then exposed to 100lmol/L hydrogen
peroxide (H
2
O
2
) and/or 60lmol/L tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-
BuOOH) for an additional 18 h. Cell viability assay was performed
using the 3-(4,5-dmethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, San Luis Obispo
, CA). Optical density was measured at 570 nm. All the experiments
were conducted in triplicate with three separate batches
of cultures.
2.10. CRMP2 and phalloidin staining for immunocytochemistry
As per the our previously published methods (Shah et al., 2007;
Nada and Shah, 2012), primary cortical neurons were seeded at a
0.75106 on a sterilized coverslip pre-coated with poly-L-lysine in
6-well dishes and pre-treated with/or without LKE (200lmol/L) for
6h  followed  byt-BuOOH treatment (60lmol/L) for an additional
6 h. Cells were then washed, fixed with freshly prepared 4% para-formaldehyde
, and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS. The
fixed cells were blocked and incubated with CRMP-2 antibody
(1:8000). Slides were washed and incubated in secondary antibody,
1:800(JacksonImmunoResearch,WestGrove,PA)followedbyincubation
with phalloidin (Invitrogen) and later on mounted with DAPI.
2.11. Statistical analyses
Infarct volumes for vehicle and ischemia/treatment groups were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Newman–Keuls post hoc test.
Neurological deficits and rotarod outcomes were analyzed by the
non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Data are presented as mean ±
SEM.Avalueofp< 0.05wasconsideredtobestatisticallysignificant.
3. Results
3.1. Oral pre-treatment of LKE reduces infract volume and improves
functional outcomes in mice subjected to p-MCAO
Initial proof of concept studies with LKE in the p-MCAO model
used a pre-treatment protocol to maximize the likelihood of

achieving the drug effects. Mice were given LKE (100 mg/kg) daily
for seven days by oral gavage and subjected to p-MCAO, after
which mice were allowed to survive for 7 days. Although generally
better recovery of locomotor activity was observed at 2, 5 and
7 days of p-MCAO in the LKE treated mice as compared to the ones
treated with vehicle, these were not statistically significant
(Fig. 1A). Grip strength was significantly improved in LKE treated
mice at day 7 (p< 0.04) (Fig. 1B). Likewise, LKE also significantly reduced
neurological deficits in mice as compared to the vehicle
group (NDS: 4.7 ± 0.4 vs. 8.2 ± 1.5; p< 0.04) (Fig. 1C). LKE administration
significantly reduced infarct volume in mice when compared
to those treated with vehicle (37.7 ± 9.4% vs. 48.5 ± 8.3%;
p< 0.03) (Fig. 1D).
3.2. Post-treatment of LKE reduces infarct volume in mice subject to
p-MCAO
To address the potential clinical relevance of LKE, we administered
LKE (100 mg/kg, i.p.) to a separate cohort of mice 4 h after
p-MCAO and then daily for 7 days. Compared to vehicle, LKE treated
mice showed better recovery in their locomotor activity measured
after 2, 5 and 7 days of p-MCAO (Fig. 1A) with significant results observed
at day 7 (p< 0.04). Grip strength was significantly improved
in LKE treated mice at day 7 (p< 0.04) (Fig. 1B). Reduced trend in
neurological deficits were observed in mice compared to the vehicle
group (Fig. 1C). However, LKE significantly lowered infarct volumes
in mice when compared to the vehicle group in the post-treatment
regimen (34.9 ± 11.3% vs. 48.5 ± 8.3%;p< 0.01) (Fig. 1D).
3.3. LKE upregulates the expression of CRMP2 and SIRT-1 and
attenuates the expression of caspase-cleaved PARP-1 in the mouse
brain cortex
A separate randomized cohort of mice pre-treated with LKE
(100 mg/kg p.o.) daily for seven days was subjected to p-MCAO
and sacrificed seven days later for the removal of their brain cortices
and subsequent western blot analyses. There were no differences
observed in sham (no p-MCAO) and LKE pre-treated sham
group (No p-MCAO). LKE significantly upregulated the expression
of CRMP2 and the anti-apoptotic SIRT-1, whereas it elicited lower
levels of the caspase cleaved fragment of PARP-1 (Fig. 2A-2F).
3.4. LKE protects primary neuronal cells from oxidative stress in a cell
viability assay
In primary neuron cultures, H

decreased cell viability as
measured by the MTT assay, whereas LKE dose-dependently protected

Fig. 2. Effect of LKE on the expression of CRMP2, PARP-1 and SIRT-1. (A, C and E) No differences were observed between sham and LKE pre-treated sham. LKE pre-treatment
significantly upregulated the expression of total CRMP2 and SIRT-1 and decreased the expression of the caspase cleaved fragment of PARP-1. (B, D and F) Corresponding

Pre-treatment with LKE (100lmol/L) for 6 h followed by t-BuOOH
(60lmol/L) exposure for another 18 h significantly protected neurons
against t-BuOOH-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 3B). These
findings correlate with prior report of LKE neuroprotection against
ROS (Hensley et al., 2010b).
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed intact F-actin and
CRMP2 expression in axons and dendrites, but a drastic breakdown
of the F-actin filaments and somatic relocation of CRMP2 was observed
in neurons when exposed to 6 h t-BuOOH, with actin no
longer extending into the axonal or dendritic structures (Fig. 4).
The CRMP2 protein appeared to be collapsed and localized mainly
in the nuclei. Pre-incubation with LKE (200lmol/L) 6 h prior to
t-BuOOH exposure restored F-actin filament network and extended
the expression of CRMP2 into both the axons and dendrites (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that LKE is neuroprotective in a
p-MCAO model of cerebral ischemia as well as in in vitromodels of
oxidative stress. The effect of LKE in cerebral ischemia is a hitherto
unexplored area and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to report that both LKE pre- and post-treatment offers significant
reversal of cortical tissue damage in an animal model of delayed
ischemia. Moreover, these protective effects were resonant with
improved functional outcomes in terms of locomotor activity (significant
in post-treatment), grip strength (significant in both preand
post-treatment) as well as neurological deficits (significant
in pre-treatment). In addition, we have successfully attributed
LKE’s putative neuroprotective mechanisms, at least in part to its
CRMP2 mediated neurotrophic and anti-apoptotic effects. The ability
of LKE to salvage neurons subjected to H
2
O
2
andt-BuOOH-mediated
oxidative stress in vitro and its veracity of the anti-apoptotic
hypothesis was confirmed by its ability to modulate the expression
of key proteins involved in the apoptotic cascade-PARP1 and SIRT1.
Our results with animal studies suggest that the daily dose of
LKE (100 mg/kg, orally) in pre-treatment paradigm produces prophylactic
effects against subsequent p-MCAO-induced ischemic
brain injury. This led us to hypothesize that LKE may have clinical
relevance, which was supported by the fact that LKE showed promise
in the post-treatment paradigms, therefore highlighting its clinical
relevance. These results are in agreement with previous
Fig. 3. Effect of LKE on neuronal survivalin vitro. (A) LKE showed significant reversal of neuronal death induced by H
2
O

in a dose-dependent manner. (B) In case of t-BuOOH
mediated cell death, the lowest protective concentration of LKE (200lmol/L) showed significant reversal of cell death. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and
repeated four times with different primary culture batches. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM; ⁄p< 0.05 vs. control, #p< 0.05 vs. stressor.

studies showing that LKE (100 mg/kg/d, i.p.) slows down progression
of paralytic disease in the SOD1G93A mouse model of familial
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as was seen in improved performance
on rotarod, delayed onset-of-paralysis, and increased
lifespan (Hensley et al., 2010b). Since LKE is a bioavailable prodrug
(data not shown), we speculate that it may be relatively
fast-acting and potent, which could be crucial in stroke therapy.
Successful results with SOD1G93A mice and pMCAO-induced stroke
justify the idea to test LKE in other neurodegenerative diseases
marked by oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, neuron
degeneration and apoptotic cell death.
Based on the prior work (Hensley et al., 2010a) indicating that LK
binds CRMP2 and provides neurotrophic action, we initially focused
on CRMP2-related pathways. CRMP2 is a multifunctional adaptor
protein that binds cytoskeletal partners to affect microtubule
dynamics, neurite outgrowth and retraction, neural differentiation,
neurotransmitter release, and other important neurophysiological
functions (Hensley et al., 2011). CRMP2 phosphorylation by
negative regulator lysophosphatidic acid results in growth cone collapse
and neurite retraction in dorsal root ganglia, but LKE acts as a
positive regulator in neurite stability (Hensley et al., 2010a,b, 2011).
Our CRMP2 upregulation was found to promote resistance to glutamate
excitotoxicity, a hallmark of ischemic damage (Hou et al.,
2009) and protection in hypoxic ischemia (Zhou et al., 2008) and
traumatic brain injury (Zhang et al., 2007). These findings led us
to believe that CRMP2 upregulation could be an effective means
of inducing neurite regeneration and subsequent neuronal survival
under ischemic conditions. We observed that LKE pre-treatment induced
significantly higher expression levels of CRMP2 in the brain
cortices of mice subjected to p-MCAO. Our immunocytochemical
studies also showed that LKE induced CRMP2 levels in primary cortical
neurons in culture, which correlated with correspondingly increased
levels of F-actin in axons and dendrites. These findings are
in contrast to previous studies where no LKE was observed to affect
CRMP2 protein expression but instead affected LKE’s affinity for
CRMP2 binding to its various partners.

green stain), and CRMP2 (red stain). The far right image shows the merged overlay of all the pictures. t-BuOOH treatment induced CRMP2 localization into the nucleus and
collapse of F-actin filaments. Pre-treatment with LKE (200lmol/L) induced the expression of CRMP2 and F-actin in axons and dendrites. Each experiment was conducted in
triplicate and repeated three times with different primary culture batches. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, thereader is referred to the web

Next, we were interested in investigating the anti-apoptotic potential
of LKE in more detail to help elucidate its neuroprotective
mechanism. It is well known that proteins partaking in energy
metabolism are closely involved in the apoptotic machinery under
ischemic conditions. PARP-1 and SIRT-1 are two such enzymes,
with both their activities dependent on NAD+. PARP-1 is activated
in response to DNA damage such as single-strand breaks, which
could develop as a response to various pathological conditions
such as inflammatory diseases, diabetes, reperfusion injury, or oxidative
stress. Overactivation of PARP-1 consumes NAD+and results
in cell death due to depletion of intracellular NAD+ stores (Ha and
Snyder, 1999). This NAD+ deficit could consequently affect the
activity of NAD+dependent SIRT-1, which is considered to be a nuclear
sensor of the redox state of the cell (Saunders and Verdin,
2007). SIRT-1 has been implicated in transcriptional silencing, genetic
control of aging, cell metabolism, and calorie restrictionmediated
longevity of the organism (Haigis and Guarente, 2006;
Pallas et al., 2008). SIRT-1 also regulates neuronal differentiation
(Guo et al., 2011; Hisahara et al., 2008; Prozorovski et al., 2008)
and participates in the ischemic preconditioning mediated neuronal
protection in the hippocampus (Raval et al., 2008), and prevents
neurodegeneration in mouse models of neuronal diseases,
including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Kim et al., 2007)
and AD (Chen et al., 2005). We report that LKE pre-treatment
inhibited the activation and thus cleavage of PARP1 into its proapoptotic
fragment, as well as upregulated the expression of SIRT1
under ischemic conditions. It is well established that activation of
PARP-1 in ischemia results in neuronal death (Virag and Szabo,
2002) and that its inhibition could result in increased ischemic
protection (Eliasson et al., 1997). On the other hand, expression
of SIRT-1 promotes cell survival (Guo et al., 2011; Rajamohan
et al., 2009) Thus, our results suggest that interplay between
PARP1 and SIRT1 could have partially contributed to the observed
protective effects of LKE and inhibition of PARP-1 could be responsible
for activating SIRT-1 by replenishing the reserves of NAD+.
5. Conclusion
We demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of the experimental
therapeutic LKE in an animal model of permanent middle
cerebral occlusion in both pre-treatment and post-treatment regimens
as well as in neuronal cell viability experiments. Furthermore
, we uncovered evidence that LKE mediated its beneficial
effects, at least in part, through CRMP2 and SIRT1 upregulation
and PARP1 inhibition. The neuroprotective and morphogenic potential
inherent to LK metabolites in ischemic conditions may begin
to suggest that LK or its derivatives may be useful for
therapeutic benefit against multiple neurodegenerative diseases
such as stroke and ischemia. Research is underway in our laboratory
to explore such possibilities.
