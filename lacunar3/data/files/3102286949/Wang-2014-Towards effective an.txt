Acute thrombosis causing vessel occlusion and resulting
in ischemic complications, such as myocardial infarction
and stroke, is a major cause of death and disability.1
Atherosclerosis, as the main underlying disease, is a progressive
inflammatory process caused by the accumulation of 
lipids and lipid-loaded macrophages in the artery wall along 
with the adherence of activated platelets and monocytes.2,3 On 
rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, thrombogenic material is 
exposed, which leads to platelet activation, aggregation, and 
vessel occlusion.
In This Issue, see p 1069
Editorial, see p 1070
Restoring and maintaining perfusion to the affected tissue 
is crucial, and treatment of acute thrombosis using plasminogen
activators (PAs, such as streptokinase), tissue plasminogen 
activators (tPA), and urokinase plasminogen activators (uPAs) 
has been proven to be beneficial.4 However, the clinical utility
of these agents has been limited by side effects such as 
bleeding complications through lysis of hemostatic clots and

Rationale: Fibrinolysis is a valuable alternative for the treatment of myocardial infarction when percutaneous 
coronary intervention is not available in a timely fashion. For acute ischemic stroke, fibrinolysis is the only 
treatment option with a very narrow therapeutic window. Clinically approved thrombolytics have significant 
drawbacks, including bleeding complications. Thus their use is highly restricted, leaving many patients untreated.
Objective: We developed a novel targeted fibrinolytic drug that is directed against activated platelets.
Methods and Results: We fused single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scuPA) to a small recombinant 
antibody (scFv
SCE5
), which targets the activated form of the platelet–integrin glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Antibody 
binding and scuPA activity of this recombinant fusion protein were on par with the parent molecules. Prophylactic 
in vivo administration of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA (75 U/g body weight) prevented carotid artery occlusion after ferric 
chloride injury in a plasminogen-dependent process compared with saline (P<0.001), and blood flow recovery was 
similar to high-dose nontargeted urokinase (500 U/g body weight). Tail bleeding time was significantly prolonged 
with this high dose of nontargeted urokinase, but not with equally effective targeted scFv
SCE5
–scuPA at 75 U/g 
body weight. Real-time in vivo molecular ultrasound imaging demonstrates significant therapeutic reduction 
of thrombus size after administration of 75 U/g body weight scFv
SCE5
–scuPA as compared with the same dose 
of a mutated, nontargeting scFv–scuPA or vehicle. The ability of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA to lyse thrombi was lost in 
plasminogen-deficient mice, but could be restored by intravenous injection of plasminogen.
Conclusions: Targeting of scuPA to activated glycoprotein IIb/IIIa allows effective thrombolysis and the potential novel 
use as a fibrinolytic agent for thromboprophylaxis without bleeding complications. (Circ Res. 2014;114:1083-1093.)

neurotoxicity in the case of stroke treatment with tPA.5,6 In addition
, thrombolytics are rapidly neutralized, and their large size 
hampers clot penetration, causing a delay in restoring perfusion.7
Further research is warranted to improve the safety and efficacy
of fibrinolytic therapy. Antibodies as tools to deliver 
thrombolytic drugs specifically to developing and existing 
clots are a promising alternative for locally enhanced potency 
and reduced side effects.
Platelets play a key role in thrombus formation3 and are, 
therefore, a target of interest for combination with thrombolytic
therapy. Targeting the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein 
(GP) IIb/IIIa on platelets has been extensively studied for the 
prevention of platelet aggregation and has led to the reduction 
of ischemic complications,8–10 especially in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention. However, in large 
clinical trials, contradictory to its anticipated therapeutic effects
, the administration of GPIIb/IIIa receptor blockers in 
combination with fibrinolytic agents has shown little improvement
in mortality, mainly because of excess bleeding,11,12 limiting
the broader utilization of the combination of GPIIb/IIIa 
inhibition and fibrinolysis. This can be, in part, attributed to 
the fact that all currently available GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors target
the receptor regardless of the activation status, thereby 
causing complete systemic inhibition of platelet aggregation 
and firm adhesion. In addition, the ligand mimetic properties 
of clinically used GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors also can lead to paradoxical
platelet activation imitating ligand-induced outsidein
signaling.13,14 We have previously addressed these issues by 
generating conformation-specific small recombinant singlechain
antibody fragments (scFv) that only target the activated 
GPIIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, avoiding outside-in signaling
and allowing effective platelet inhibition without prolonging
bleeding time.15,16 The potential of these scFvs to be 
used as targeting tools has been demonstrated by their use in 
noninvasive diagnostic molecular imaging of thrombosis and 
inflammation.17–19
Here, we use the targeting potential of a specific 
single-chain antibody SCE5, which selectively binds activated
GPIIb/IIIa, to enrich the plasminogen activator scuPA 
at the site of platelet activation. We describe the recombinant 
fusion of this scFv to scuPA and the in vitro and in vivo testing
of this novel targeted drug. This therapeutic approach 
facilitates highly effective thrombolysis without prolonging 
bleeding time. In addition, the described ability to inhibit 
thrombus formation together with the effective targeting 
at low systemic concentration could potentially allow the 
unique application of a fibrinolytic drug in a thromboprophylactic
approach.
Methods
A detailed description of methods is provided in the Online Data 
Supplement.
Generation, Expression, and Purification of scFVs 
and scuPAs
Two different scFvs (activated GPIIb/IIIa-targeted scFv
SCE5
 and 
nontargeted scFv
mut
) were fused with active scuPA and cloned into 
the pSectag2A vector system. Briefly, both scFv–scuPA plasmid 
constructs were produced using the human embryonic kidney cells 
(H293F) suspension culture. All scFv–scuPAs contain a 6x His-tag, 
which was used for purification with nickel-based metal affinity chromatography
(Invitrogen).
Evaluation of the scFv–scuPA Constructs
The purity of the proteins was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and 
Western blotting. Anti–6x His-tag antibody horseradish peroxidase 
was used to detect the purified scFv–scuPA constructs. The scuPA in 
the fusion protein was converted to the active form using plasmin to 
cleave the Lys-158 to Ile-159 bond.
Static Adhesion Assay
The specificity of scFv
SCE5
 targeting activated GPIIb/IIIa was demonstrated
using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were either expressing
activated GPIIb/IIIa integrin, nonactivated GPIIb/IIIa, or not 
expressing the GPIIb/IIIa integrin. Cells were grown to confluency in 
6-well plates (BD Bioscience), incubated with purified scFv–scuPAs, 
followed by anti-Penta-His AlexaFluor 488–conjugated monoclonal 
antibody (anti-His-488; Qiagen, Germany). Cells were visualized 
with the IX81 Olympus microscope (Olympus, Japan) and Cell^P 
1692 (ANALysis Image Processing) software.
Flow Cytometry
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained from healthy volunteers. 
Diluted PRP was either not activated or activated with 20 μmol/L 
ADP, 5 μg/mL collagen-related peptide, or 30 μmol/L thrombin 
receptor-activating peptide before incubation with the purified scFv 
constructs, followed by anti-His-488 for detection. The activity of 
platelets was determined by FITC-labeled fibrinogen, PAC1-FITC, 
and CD62P-PE. The specificity of scFv
SCE5
 targeting activated platelets
was analyzed using FITC-labeled fibrinogen and PAC1-FITC. 
Competitive assays were performed using abciximab (ReoPro) 
and FITC-labeled fibrinogen. Samples were fixed with 1x Cellfix 
(BD Bioscience) and analyzed by FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience). In 
addition, GPIIb/IIIa-expressing CHO cells were also used for flow 
cytometry.
Urokinase Activity Assay
Urokinase activity was determined with a chromogenic substrate 
assay. A comparison between clinically used uPA (Medac GmbH, 
Germany) and scFv–scuPA was made on the basis of equal urokinase 
activity. About 100 nmol/L of scFv–scuPA was monitored against 
urokinase standards (0–100 U/mL) used as positive controls. Plasmin 
was added to activate scuPA. S2444 (Chromogenix, Italy) was added
, and samples were measured on a Victor3V Multi-label counter 
(PerkinElmer) at a wavelength of 405 nm.
Plasmin Activity Assay
The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin using commercial uPA 
or the 2 scFv–scuPA versions was determined in microtiter plates 
using a chromogenic substrate. Ten nmol/L of commercial uPA and 
scFv–scuPAs was incubated with 400 nmol/L of human glu-plasminogen
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mmol/L of S2251 (Chromogenix, Italy). 
Samples were measured using the Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus at a wavelength
of 405 nm every 30 seconds over a period of 60 minutes.
Fibrin Zymography
SDS-PAGE–based fibrin zymography20 was performed to evaluate
plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity of the targeted and 
nontargeted scFv–scuPA. Briefly, the commercial uPA and scuPA

were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were 
washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1.5 hours and then placed on top 
of a fibrin/agarose–plasminogen matrix. The washed SDS-PAGE 
gel was then overlaid onto the exposed agarose gel and incubated 
in a humidified 37°C oven until lytic zones were evident. Images 
were captured at various incubation times using a flatbed document
scanner.
Light Transmission Aggregometry
Ninety-six–well plate light transmission aggregometry was performed
using 100 μL of PRP. PRP were incubated with abciximab
, scFv–scuPA, scFv
SCE5
 alone, or commercial uPA and then 
activated with 10 μmol/L ADP. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained
by centrifugation of blood at 1000g for 10 minutes at room 
temperature. Light transmission was adjusted to 0% with PRP 
and 100% with platelet-poor plasma. To differentiate the effects 
of scFv from those of urokinase, 200 μmol/L of the urokinase 
blocker amiloride21 was added. Light transmission aggregometry
was measured using the Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus at wavelength
of 595 nm. Samples were measured every 30 seconds for 
60 minutes.
Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay
Flow chamber in vitro adhesion assays were performed with glass 
capillaries or microfluidic flow channels, which were coated overnight
with collagen. Whole blood was perfused through the capillaries
or channels to form microthrombi. Binding of scFv–scuPAs 
was observed via staining with anti-His-488. Fibrin degradation was 
demonstrated using Oregon-Green Fibrinogen (Invitrogen). The microthrombi
were visualized with the IX81 Olympus microscope and 
Cell^P 1692 software.
In Vivo Mouse Experiments
Male C57BL/6 mice and plasminogen-knockout mice (plg−/− mice; 
Jackson Laboratories) were maintained at the Alfred Medical 
Research and Education Precinct Animal Services and assigned randomly
to the different groups. The amount of targeted and nontargeted
scFv–scuPA for injection was calculated according to units per 
gram body weight of the animals. The animals were anesthetized, 
shaved, and placed on a 37°C heater mat to prevent hypothermia. 
All experiments involving animals were approved by the Alfred 
Medical Research and Education Precinct Animal Ethics Committee 
(E/1160/2011/B).
Femoral Vein Catheterization and Ferric 
Chloride Injury Model for Doppler Flow Velocity 
Measurement
A catheter was placed into the femoral vein to facilitate injection. A 
small filter paper saturated with 10% ferric chloride was placed under 
the carotid artery of the animal for 3 minutes to induce an occlusive 
thrombus.22 Animals were injected with either constructs or controls 
1 minute before the injury. The nano-Doppler flow-probe (0.5VB; 
Transonic, Japan) was placed under the carotid artery postinjury to 
measure thrombotic occlusion.
Intravital Microscopy of the Mesenteric Arterioles 
in Mice
Intravital microscopy was performed as previously described.23
Briefly, the mesentery was exteriorized through a midline abdominal
incision. Six percent ferric chloride was used to induce thrombus 
formation on mesenteric arterioles. Binding of the scFv–scuPAs conjugated
with Cy3 fluorescence dye (Lumiprobe) was monitored using
the fluorescence channel on the Nikon A1r confocal microscope 
(Nikon, Japan).
Assessment of Tail Bleeding Time
An incision to reveal the left jugular vein was made to insert a catheter
to facilitate injections. One minute after injecting commercial 
uPA, scFv–scuPAs, or vehicle, the tail was transected 5 mm from the 
tip and immediately submersed in saline at 37°C. The bleeding time 
was monitored and recorded as the time needed for the cessation of 
visible blood stream for 1 minute.
In Vivo Ultrasound Molecular Imaging of Carotid 
Artery Thrombolysis
Ultrasound of animals was performed with a Vevo770 
high-resolution imaging system (VisualSonics Inc, Canada) using a 
40-MHz RMV704 transducer. Animals were placed on the imaging 
station after 6% ferric chloride injury was performed to the left carotid
artery. Videos and images were acquired before, during, and 
at several time points after injecting 1.5×107 targeted microbubbles 
(ligand-induced binding sides–targeted microbubbles, LIBS-MBs) 
specific for activated platelets (targeting the ligand-induced binding
site on activated GPIIb/IIIa) in a total volume of 100 μL. We 
have recently established this ultrasound imaging methodology 
for the assessment of thrombosis and thrombolysis.19 We injected 
500 U/g of uPA (Medac, Germany), 75 U/g of scFv–scuPA, or 
saline as vehicle control. Repetitive ultrasound imaging sequences 
were performed every 5 minutes for an hour after thrombolysis. 
Analysis was performed using a linear contrast agent imaging software
(VisualSonics Inc).
In Vivo Ultrasound Molecular Imaging of Carotid 
Artery Thrombolysis Using plg−/− Mice
plg−/− Mice were placed on the VisualSonics imaging station after 6% 
ferric chloride injury was performed to the left carotid artery. Images 
were acquired before injection of LIBS-MBs. Thereafter, we injected 
75 U/g of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA or scFv
mut
–scuPA. Repetitive ultrasound 
imaging sequences were performed every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. 
A 150-μL bolus of 100 μg/mL human plasminogen (Sigma-Aldrich) 
was injected at 30-minute time point and repetitive imaging sequences
continued for another 30 minutes. Analysis was performed using a 
linear contrast agent imaging software.
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise specified, data are expressed as mean±SEM. 
Flow cytometry, flow chamber, and data for thrombolysis were analyzed
with 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA using Bonferroni 
multiple comparison post-test. All analyses containing >2 groups 
were corrected by post hoc analysis, and the corrected P values 
are given. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism 5.0.
Results
Cloning and Purification of scFv–scuPA Constructs
The success of DNA amplification and restriction digest of 
scFv–scuPA fragments was evaluated by electrophoresis 
(Online Figure I). Both constructs were visualized between 
1.5 and 2 kbp marker after amplification with PCR and restriction
digest. The pSectag2A plasmid was visualized at ≈5 kbps 
after single-cut restriction digest. After the respective constructs
were cloned into the pSectag2A plasmid, transformed, 
and purified, they were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. 
The sequences of both fusion constructs were confirmed via 
DNA sequencing. After production of the scFvs, SDS-PAGE 
and Western blot were used to prove successful purification 
(Online Figure IIA and IIB). Western blot was also used to 
demonstrate the digestion of scuPA after the addition of plasmin
(Online Figure IIB).
Binding of Targeted scuPA to CHO Cells In Vitro
The specificity of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA was also observed under 
static adhesion conditions. Direct fluorescence staining using

nonexpressing or nonactivated GPIIb/IIIa-expressing CHO 
cells. No fluorescence staining was observed for all 3 cell 
types with scFv
mut
–scuPA (Figure 1). In flow cytometry, the 
incubation of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA with CHO cells resulted in an 
increase in fluorescence intensity for samples with activated 
GPIIb/IIIa-expressing CHO cells but not on either nonexpressing
or nonactivated GPIIb/IIIa-expressing CHO cells 
(P<0.01; Online Figure III).
Evaluation of the Functionality of scFv–scuPA by 
Flow Cytometry
To confirm retained binding capacity of scFv to ADP-activated 
platelets, the functionality of scFv–scuPA was evaluated with 
anti-His-488 (Figure 2). No binding was observed for control 
nontargeted scFv
mut
 to either activated or nonactivated platelets 
(2.69±0.18 versus 2.84±0.25 arbitrary units [AU]; mean±SD; 
ns). The incubation of activated platelets with scFv
SCE5
 resulted
in an increase in fluorescence intensity as compared 
with nonactivated platelets (2.69±0.16 versus 23.88±8.22 
AU; mean±SD; P<0.01). Competitive assays were performed 
using FITC-labeled fibrinogen to demonstrate the binding 
of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA. After incubation with scFv
SCE5
–scuPA, 
fibrinogen was not able to bind to activated platelets anymore. 
However, after incubation with scFv
mut
–scuPA, fibrinogen 
binding was not inhibited (57.11±5.82 versus 75.54±23.2 
versus 4.67±2.92 AU; P<0.001). Competitive assays using 
PAC1 showed similar results as with FITC-labeled fibrinogen
(39.03±6.5 versus 41.74±6.45 versus 3.03±0.21 AU; 
P<0.01). The binding of scFv
SCE5
 was also confirmed with 
collagen-related peptide and thrombin receptor-activating 
peptide–activated platelets (Online Figure IVA). Platelet activation
by these platelet agonists was demonstrated using PAC1 
and anti-CD62P fluorescence staining (Online Figure IVB and 
IVC). The specificity of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA binding to activated 
GPIIb/IIIa on activated platelets was demonstrated via competition
with abciximab (Online Figure VA). The specificity of 
scFv
SCE5
–scuPA toward fibrinogen-binding sites on activated 
GPIIb/IIIa was demonstrated by decreased binding of fibrinogen
on increased concentrations of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA in flow 
cytometry (Online Figure VB).

fusion proteins to inhibit platelet aggregation. High concentrations
of scFv
SCE5
 alone (5 and 10 μg/mL) and equimolar 
amounts of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA (10 and 20 μg/mL) demonstrated
a strong inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation 
as opposed to scFv
mut
–scuPA, which showed no inhibitory 
effect (Figure 3A; n=4; P<0.001). At lower concentrations, 
scFv
SCE5
 alone (0.1 and 1 μg/mL) and equimolar amounts of 
scFv
SCE5
–scuPA (0.2 and 2 μg/mL) would not inhibit platelet
aggregation. Platelet aggregation also was not inhibited 
with 100 or 200 U of commercial uPA (P<0.001). Similar 
results were obtained when 200 μmol/L of amiloride was 
used to block the function of scuPA (Figure 3B), demonstrating
that urokinase has no effect on thrombus formation 
in this assay.
In Vitro Evaluation of the Urokinase Activity of 
scFv–scuPA
Urokinase activity was monitored by incubating scFv–scuPA 
with urokinase substrate S2444L (Online Figure VIA) in 
comparison with commercial uPA. Both scFv–scuPAs and 
standards using commercial uPA at different concentrations 
resulted in linear enzymatic activity >60 minutes.
In Vitro Evaluation for the Conversion of 
Plasminogen to Plasmin Using scFv–scuPA
The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was monitored 
using the S2251 amidolytic assay (Online Figure VIB). Both 
scFv–scuPA versions and the commercial uPA at 10 nmol/L 
generated plasmin activity. uPA-dependent plasmin generation
was blocked in the presence of 200 μmol/L of the urokinase
inhibitor amiloride. SDS-PAGE fibrin zymography was 
also performed to demonstrate the direct digestion of fibrin 
(Online Figure VIC). Commercial uPA produced a lytic zone 
as expected at ≈55 kDa. scFv
SCE5
–scuPA and scFv
mut
–scuPA 
produced a lytic zone at ≈70 kDa.

in vitro in a flow chamber adhesion experiment with 
microthrombi. Fluorescence staining using anti-His-488 demonstrated
binding of scFv

(Figure 4A). Fibrin degradation was observed when scFv

fibrin degradation was observed specifically around platelet aggregates
(Online Figure VII).
Evaluation of scFv–scuPA Binding to  
Thrombi In Vivo
Binding of scFv–scuPA was determined by intravital microscopy
in a ferric chloride–induced thrombosis model in the 
mesenteric arterioles of mice. The binding of scFv
SCE5
–scuPA 
conjugated with the fluorescent dye Cy3 to developing thrombi 
could be demonstrated, whereas no fluorescence was observed 
with scFv
mut
–scuPA (Figure 4C).
In Vivo Evaluation of scFv–scuPA for  
Prophylactic Fibrinolysis
Thrombi were induced in the carotid artery of mice using 10% 
ferric chloride for 3 minutes. Blood flow was measured by a 
nano-Doppler flow-probe and used as an indicator of occlusive 
thrombus (Figure 5). Saline was injected as a negative control, 
and 500 U/g of commercial uPA was used as a positive control. 
The baseline Doppler velocity was set to 100%. At 20 minutes, 
Doppler flow velocities obtained from mice treated with 75 U/g

In Vivo Assessment of Bleeding Time  
of scFv–scuPA
Bleeding times were evaluated by surgical tail transection 
(Figure 6). Commercial uPA at 500 U/g considerably prolonged 
bleeding compared with vehicle control (saline). In contrast, a 
lower dose of 75 U/g of scFv
SCE5

commercial uPA minimized bleeding time. The lower dose of 
scFv

prolonging bleeding time.
In Vivo Molecular Ultrasound Imaging  
of Thrombolysis
Imaging of the mouse carotid artery on ultrasound typically 
shows luminal blood as black or dark color, and microbubbles 
appear as a bright white color in the lumen. The thrombus 
was visualized as a white and bright signal after injection 
with platelet-targeted ultrasound contrast (LIBS-MB) on realtime
ultrasound imaging. The baseline area before injection 
of uPA was set to 100%, and the area was calculated every 5 
minutes for 60 minutes (Figure 7). The targeting ability of 75 
U/g of scFv

Discussion
Thrombolysis has been widely used as a therapy in acute 
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, as well as pulmonary 
embolism.4,24 However, limitations in thrombolytic efficacy, 
neurotoxicity of tPA,25 and bleeding complications have restricted
overall use.6,26 The administration of anticoagulants 
in combination with fibrinolytic agents, in particular, has 
shown little improvement in mortality, safety, and efficacy.27
Therefore, research into more effective treatments is required, 
which could overcome the challenges associated with current
fibrinolytic therapy. Targeting activated platelets with 
antibody-mediated delivery of thrombolytic drugs can provide
an effective and safe alternative. This ideal agent would: 
(1) allow a low concentration in systemic circulation, thereby 
eliminating bleeding complications, and (2) enrich by targeting
at the site of thrombus, thereby being present in localized 
high concentrations to lyse the clot.
In this study, we conjugated a highly specific scFv 
that binds to the activated platelet integrin receptor 
GPIIb/IIIa and recombinant scuPA. Our data demonstrate 
that scuPA delivery to activated platelets allows local enrichment
of fibrinolytic agents at the site of the developing

bleeding time as compared with saline vehicle controls (*P<0.05;

or existing thrombus, thereby increasing fibrinolytic potency
without increasing side effects. Through in vitro assays
, we provide evidence that both scFv and scuPA retain 
their individual function in the fusion molecule. In vivo 
evaluation of these targeted fibrinolytics as both a prophylactic
and a therapeutic agent showed plasminogen-dependent
inhibition of thrombus growth as well as reduction 
in thrombus size via molecular ultrasound imaging. A low 
dose of 75 U/g of platelet-targeted scuPA was sufficient 
for localized thrombolysis, which was not achieved using 
nontargeted scuPA or commercial uPA at the same dose. 
The same effects were only achieved using urokinase at 
500 U/g. We did not observe increased bleeding at the effective
dose of the novel targeted scuPA, compared with an 
equally effective higher dose of nontargeted scuPA, which 
resulted in a significantly prolonged bleeding time. This 
antithrombotic effect of a low dose of 75 U/g of platelettargeted
scuPA was more potent than the combination of 
equimolar nontargeted scuPA and the activation-specific 
anti-GPIIb/IIIa scFv
SCE5
. This indicates that the superior 
antithrombotic effect of the fusion protein scFv
SCE5
–scuPA 
can be attributed to the antibody targeting of scuPA to activated
GPIIb/IIIa on activated platelets and the resulting 
local enrichment of scuPA at the thrombus. If a stronger 
antiplatelet effect is required, a dual effect composed of 
effective platelet inhibition and low-dose targeted fibrinolysis
would be attractive and could be achieved with the 
coadministration of activation-specific anti-GPIIb/IIIa 
scFv alone. For a potential human therapy, the optimal 
dosing regimen would have to be determined in clinical 
trials. Notably, the combination of low-dose targeted fibrinolytic
and activation-specific platelet inhibition would 
not be expected to have similar bleeding problems as seen 
in clinical trials with nontargeted fibrinolytics and non–
activation-specific GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors.27
Early work mainly focused on the use of full monoclonal 
antibodies targeting specific components of the clot, such as 
fibrin or platelets. Indeed, in vivo studies have shown greater 
antithrombotic therapy with the use of fibrin-targeting thrombolytics.28,29 It has also been shown that potent fibrin targeting 
during thrombolysis has resulted in a high plasminogen concentration
on the surface of the clot.30
Our study focuses on platelets, because activated platelets
are an obvious target for the enrichment of thrombolytics
at the clot. To explore the advantages of targeting 
PAs to platelets, monoclonal antibodies directed against 
both GPIIb/IIIa and the ligand-binding epitope of GPIIb/
IIIa have been reported.31 GPIIb/IIIa is the most abundant 
platelet receptor with 50000 to 80000 glycoproteins per
platelet and, thus, constituting ≈2% of the amount of total 
platelet protein.32 Despite increasing the potency by fusing 
PAs to monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments, chemical 
conjugation has several disadvantages, including the inactivation
of enzymatic sites by the harsh chemical conditions 
for conjugating, which can reduce efficacy.31,33 In addition, 
the large size of the antibody fusion constructs hampered 
tissue penetration.
To overcome these problems, recombinant fusion technology
was used to avoid chemical conjugation, thereby 
preserving the activity of the construct. Antibody fragments
such as scFvs are preferred moieties for the construction
of recombinant fusion constructs because they are 
small, minimally immunogenic, and the cost of production 
is generally low.34,35
Antibody-targeted delivery also eliminates the dependence
on the specificity of certain PAs, such as tPA, for the 
components of clots such as fibrin. Still the gold standard 
therapy for acute ischemic stroke,36 tPA is neurotoxic,25 and 
the use of urokinase or desmoteplase avoids these complications
inherent to tPA.37,38 This has the potential to widen the 
currently very narrow therapeutic window for stroke thrombolysis
of 3 to 4 hours.6 The truncated, low-molecular-weight 
form scuPA is the preferred entity over full-length urokinase 
because it provides a smaller size with improved thrombus 
accessibility, no immunogenicity, and similar fibrinolytic 
potency.39
In addition to fibrin- and platelet-targeting approaches, 
there are several other components of the vasculature and 
blood that have been targeted, such as platelet endothelial 
cell adhesion molecule-1, glycophorin A on RBCs, and 
thrombomodulin, to anchor PAs to the arterial or venous 
lumen.40–43 Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 
fused with urokinase in a model of cerebrovascular thromboembolism
mediated almost complete clot lysis without 
exacerbating the characteristic side effects such as intracerebral
hemorrhage.44 Targeting RBCs was shown to have

effective prophylaxis against arterial and venous thrombosis
for ≈24 hours.42
Although targeting platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
or RBCs has shown successful thrombolysis, they 
do not serve as exclusive targets because of ubiquitous expression.
We have previously reported that scFvs against fibrin
conjugated to scuPA,45 or against platelets conjugated 
to an anticoagulant,22 are predominantly active only at the 
site of the clot, allowing increased potency. In the present
study, we have expanded our work to a scFv fusion 
molecule, which delivers scuPA activation specific to the 
GPIIb/IIIa platelet receptor. On activation, GPIIb/IIIa undergoes
a conformation change, which allows a high-affinity state 
for fibrinogen binding, resulting in platelet aggregation and 
thrombus formation.9,15 This property is ideal for specifically 
targeting activated platelets. The scFv
SCE5
 used in this work is 
exclusive in its specificity for the activated conformation of 
GPIIb/IIIa thereby, representing a unique targeting tool.15,16,23
In addition to our well-established Doppler flow measurements15,22 allowing the assessment of vessel patency, 
we also applied a recently developed real-time ultrasound 
method with scFv-targeted microbubbles used as echo enhancers.19 The small size of scFv has advantages for molecular
imaging because it provides a better access to the 
targeted epitopes. In contrast to the anti-GPIIb/IIIa scFv 
used in the scuPA fusion construct, the scFv on the microbubbles
binds to LIBS on GPIIb/IIIa, preserving the ligand 
binding function. This new molecular imaging approach 
allows the unique real-time and direct monitoring of the 
success and extent of thrombolysis, and it holds promise to 
substantially facilitate further research in thrombogenesis 
and especially thrombolysis. Furthermore, this technique 
is also highly promising for clinical use. It is noninvasive, 
inexpensive, and most importantly provides real-time analysis
of vessel occlusion and reopening in an emergency 
setting. Direct ultrasound imaging of changes in thrombus 
size is a technique that could have broad clinical applications
in detecting the success or failure of therapeutic interventions
in thrombotic disease and, thus, provide major 
benefits for patients.
The potential clinical use of these targeted fusion proteins
for the prevention and treatment of stroke, myocardial
infarction, and venous thrombosis presents a novel 
strategy for highly effective thrombolysis. The expected 
reduction of bleeding complications could lead the way 
out of the current stagnation in the field of fibrinolytic 
therapy. Our data also have interesting implications 
for the potential use of a fibrinolytic drug for prophylaxis
/prevention of thrombosis. Monoclonal antibodies 
(eg, Humira) are increasingly used as subcutaneous 
drugs for self-administration by patients.46 This opens 
the possibility that recombinant fusion proteins such as 
scFv
SCE5
–scuPA could potentially be used for thromboprophylaxis.
More preclinical and clinic research is warranted
to investigate the feasibility of such an application. 
Furthermore, the described molecular ultrasound imaging 
with platelet-targeted microbubbles allows precise monitoring
of interventional success.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the successful generation of a novel 
recombinant single-chain antibody–scuPA fusion protein, 
specifically targeting activated platelets. The function of both 
components of the fusion protein, thrombolytic activity and 
antibody binding, to activated GPIIb/IIIa was preserved. In 
vivo evaluation of this targeted fibrinolytic agent, in comparison
to clinically used nontargeted fibrinolytic agents, showed 
that a low systemic concentration of the fusion protein allows 
enrichment of fibrinolytic activity at the site of the thrombus 
and thus the potentiation of fibrinolytic activity. Most importantly
, this could be achieved without prolonging bleeding
time. Therefore, this novel fibrinolytic agent promises 
to overcome the current limitations in thrombolytic therapy 
associated with the risk of bleeding complications. It has the 
potential to break the fatal link between increased fibrinolytic 
potency and bleeding complications. This targeting strategy 
also allows considering the application of a fibrinolytic drug 
for thromboprophylaxis, an approach that warrants further 
preclinical and potential clinical testing.

What Is Known?
•	 The initiating events in acute thrombotic events, such as myocardial 
infarction (MI) and stroke, include platelet activation, conversion of fibrinogen
to fibrin, and eventual formation of an obstructing/occluding 
thrombus/clot.
•	 Thrombolytic drugs such as urokinase were developed to lyse clots 
through the conversion of the endogenous proenzyme plasminogen to 
the active fibrinolytic protease plasmin.
•	 Treatment with thrombolytic drugs, however, is often ineffective and 
associated with bleeding complications because of a lack of site specificity
and, hence, disruption of normal hemostasis.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
•	 Molecular cloning techniques can be used to create a fusion construct 
of single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scuPA) and a small 
single-chain antibody (scFv
SCE5
) directed specifically against the activated
glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor of platelets in a developing clot.
•	 The fusion construct (scFv
SCE5
–scuPA) allows for a small administered 
dose of urokinase to concentrate at the site of the developing clot, leading
to a high local concentration with low systemic concentrations.
•	 Systemic administration of this targeted scuPA to mice subjected to 
arterial thrombosis leads to effective thrombolysis without negative effects
on hemostasis.
Thrombolytic drugs are highly effective when used for the treatment
of MI and ischemic stroke. Bleeding complications due to 
interference with normal hemostasis, however, restrict application
to a relatively small group of patients. Strategies to target 
the thrombolytic activity specifically to the site of thrombosis 
are attractive because they promise effective thrombolysis 
without undesired bleeding complications. We genetically fused 
scFv
SCE5
 with scuPA to form scFv
SCE5
–scuPA. The unique affinity 
of scFv
SCE5
 for the activated conformation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor
and thus for activated platelets means that once injected 
systemically, scFv
SCE5
–scuPA enriches in the region of a developing
thrombus and exerts potent thrombolytic activity because 
of its high local concentration, while avoiding bleeding complications
, due to its low systemic concentration. In mice with 
induced arterial thrombosis, a 6-fold lower dose of targeted 
scuPA had equivalent efficacy to clinically used uPA, but without 
associated bleeding time prolongation. This demonstration of 
targeted thrombolysis using an activation-specific platelet antibody
holds promise for safer and more effective thrombolysis 
in patients with MI or stroke, including those that have been 
excluded so far based on bleeding concerns. Furthermore, the 
improved safety profile allows the consideration of fibrinolytics 
being given as thromboprophylactic drugs.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL 
Supplemental Methods 
Generation, expression and purification of single-chain antibodies and single-chain 
urokinase plasminogen activator 
The generation of two different scFvs (activated GPIIb/IIIa-targeted scFvSCE5 and nontargeted
scFvmut), both fused with active scuPA, were cloned into the pSectag2A vector 
system. Briefly, for both scFv-scuPAs, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with 
a sense primer that anneals at the beginning of the scFv sequence and an antisense primer 
that anneals directly to the 6x His-tag region at the end of the scFv. The sense strand 
includes the AscI restriction site and the antisense strand includes the XhoI restriction site. 
The scFv
SCE5
-scuPA was generated with the following primers: sense strand: 5’- ATC TTA 
GGC GCG CCA TGG CGG AGG TGC AGC TGG T -3’, antisense strand: 5’- GCC CGT 
CTC GAG TAC CGG TAC GCG TAG AAT CGA GAC C -3’. The scFvmut-scuPA was 
generated with the following primers: sense strand: 5’- ATC TTA GGC GCG CCA TGG CGG 
AAG TGC AGC TGG TG -3’, antisense strand: 5’- GCC CGT CTC GAG TAC CGG TAC 
GCG TAG AAT CGA GAC C -3’. After amplification by PCR, the constructs were digested 
with the restriction enzymes AscI and XhoI (both NEB, USA), and cloned into pAC6 vector 
(Avidity, USA). Electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel with SYBR® Safe DNA gel stain 
(Invitrogen, USA) was utilized to analyze DNA amplified by PCR and restriction digests. 
Ligation of the plasmids was performed with T4 ligase (NEB, USA) at 16°C overnight. The 
resulting plasmid constructs were then transformed into BL21 Star E.coli cells (Invitrogen, 
USA).  
Expression in mammalians cells and purification of scFv-scuPA fusion constructs 
Production of mammalian cells was performed using the human embryonic kidney cells 
(H293F) suspension culture transfection with polyethylenimine (Polyscience Inc., Germany). 
This system is used for the production of proteins from pSectag vectors. DNA plasmid for 
transfection was diluted to a ratio of 1:4 with polyethylenimine (PEI). 24 hours prior to 
transfection, H293F cells were diluted with Freestyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen, 
USA) to a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cell density was approximately 2 x 106
cells/ml at time of transfection and the viability was greater than 95%. A ratio of 9:1 was 
used for the amount of Freestyle 293 expression medium to the PBS mixture of DNA and 
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-400551382)
2 
PEI. Appropriate amount of cell culture medium was transferred into a shaker flask and 
placed in a CO
2
 incubator at 37ºC, shaking at 110 rpm. 1μg/ml of DNA plasmid was added 
to pre-warmed (37ºC) PBS and vortexed gently. PEI was added at a concentration of 
3μg/ml, and vortexed three times for three seconds. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 
room temperature (RT). The cell culture medium was removed from the incubator. The DNAPEI
mixture was added to the medium while swirling gently. Glucose was added to a final 
concentration of 6g/L. The flask was returned to the incubation and cultured at 37ºC, with 
5% CO2, shaking at 110 – 140rpm. The culture was supplemented with 5g/L Lupin and 0.2 
mM butyric acid after one day. At day 3, 5 and 7 after transfection, the culture was 
supplemented with 2mmol/L glutamine. At day 5, the culture was supplemented with 5g/L 
Lupin. The glucose level was maintained at a final concentration of 5 – 6g/L. The cells were 
harvested when viability was 40 – 50%. The cells were centrifuged at 3000xg for 15 min at 
4°C and supernatant was collection for protein purification. All purified single-chain 
antibodies carry a 6x His-tag at the C-terminal end of their amino acid sequence for 
purification by IMAC and for FACS analysis. Proteins were purified with a nickel-based metal 
affinity chromatography column, Ni-NTA column (Invitrogen, USA), according to the 
manufacturer’s instruction manual. Fractions of 1ml were collected and dialyzed against 
PBS. 
Evaluation of the scFv-scuPA fusion proteins  
Purity of the proteins was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. 30μl of each purified protein and 6μl 
of 5X reducing SDS loading buffer were added to 1.5ml tubes and denatured at 96˚C for 5 
min. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE gel in SDS running buffer at 30mA for 2 hours. 
The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1 hour and subsequently 
destained for at least 12 hours with Coomassie destaining solution. The gel was visualized 
and analyzed using a BioRad Gel-Doc system with Quantity One software. 
After SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, the membrane was blocked with 1% 
BSA and hybridized with a specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Anti-6x His-tag® antibody 
HRP was used to detect the fusion proteins. Secondary hybridization was performed with 
SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific Inc, USA), an 
enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate for the HRP enzyme. Plasmin was added to 
digest the scuPA to the two chain urokinase by cleaving the Lys-158 and Ile-159 bond.

Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells culture 
The specificity of the scFv
SCE5
 targeting activated GPIIb/IIIa was demonstrated using 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that were either expressing activated GPIIb/IIIa 
integrin, non-activated GPIIb/IIIa integrin or not expressing the integrin. Cells were grown to 
90% confluency before washing with PBS, and addition of 0.05% Tryspin (Invitrogen, USA) 
for 5 min. These cells were used in flow cytometry to show the specificity of the scFv-scuPA. 
1 x 106 CHO cells per 50µl were used for incubated with scFv-scuPA and stained with anti-
Penta-His AlexaFluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody. In addition, PAC1-FITC was 
used to show expression of activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the respective CHO cells. A 
gate was set around the cells and 10,000 cells were analyzed. The scFv binding was 
expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. 
Static adhesion assay  
Static adhesion assay were performed using CHO cells that were either expressing 
activated GPIIb/IIIa integrin, non-activated GPIIb/IIIa integrin or not expressing the integrin. 
The CHO cells (1 x 106/well) were grown to confluency in 6-well plates (BD Bioscience, 
USA). The wells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 10μg/ml of purified scFv 
for 10 min at 37oC. The wells were washed twice with PBS, followed by anti-Penta-His 
AlexaFluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody for 15 min. The wells were then washed 
three times with PBS and visualized with the IX81 Olympus microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, 
Japan) and Cell^P 1692 (ANALysis Image Processing) software, using DIC and 
fluorescence imaging with 20x objective. 
Flow cytometry 
Blood was collected from healthy volunteers who had taken no medication for at least 10 
days. In an attempt to minimize platelet activation during blood collection, blood was 
obtained by venipuncture from an antecubital vein through a 21 gauge needle with no 
tourniquet. The first 2ml of blood were discarded. The collected blood was anticoagulated 
with 10% citric acid. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation at 180xg for 
10 min at room temperature. The PRP was collected and diluted 1:20 with PBS containing 
100mg/L calcium chloride and 100mg/L magnesium chloride. Diluted PRP was either not 
activated or activated with 20µM ADP, 5µg/ml collagen-related peptide (CRP) or 30µM 
thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) for 5 min. Activity of platelets was determined 
by FITC-labelled fibrinogen, PAC1-FITC and anti-CD62P-PE. As described in details below, 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1590235347)

the platelets were analyzed by flow cytometry using either a single fluorochrome (single 
staining) or two fluorochromes (dual staining). For single staining, incubation with 10μg/ml of 
purified scFv for 10 min at 37oC was followed by 1µl of anti-Penta-His AlexaFluor 488-
conjugated monoclonal antibody for 15 min. Samples were fixed with 1x Cellfix (BD 
Bioscience, USA) and analysed by FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, USA). In addition, the 
specificity of scFv
SCE5
 targeting activated platelets was analyzed in a competitive flow 
cytometry assay, using FITC-labelled fibrinogen and PAC1-FITC. Both FITC-labelled 
fibrinogen and PAC1-FITC bind to the activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors on activated platelets. 
For dual staining, incubation with both 10μg/ml of purified scFv and CD62P-PE for 10 min at 
37oC was followed by 1µl of anti-Penta-His AlexaFluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody 
for 15 min. Competitive assays were also performed using 10ug/ml of abciximab (ReoPro®). 
Further dose dependent competitive assays were performed using the scFv
SCE5
 and FITC-
labelled fibrinogen. Samples were fixed with 1x Cellfix and analysed by FACS Calibur.  
Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer. The 
platelets were distinguished using the forward and sideward light scatter profile. A gate was 
set around the platelets and 10,000 cells were analyzed. For single staining, the AlexaFluor 
488 fluorescence is used to quantitate the amount of platelet-bound scFv. The scFv binding 
was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. For dual staining, the AlexaFluor 488 
fluorescence and CD62P-PE fluorescence is used to quantitate the amount of activated 
platelet-bound scFv. 
Urokinase activity assay  
Urokinase activity was determined in microtiter plates with a chromogenic substrate assay. 
Comparison between clinically used uPA (Medac GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and scFvscuPA
was made on the basis of equal urokinase activity. A volume of 50μl scFv-scuPA, 
each with a final concentration of 100nmol/L, was monitored against 50μl urokinase 
standards (0–100U/mL) used as positive control. Single-chain urokinase was converted to 
the active form using 0.1U/L plasmin in assay buffer (38mmol/L of NaCl, 5mmol/L of Tris–
HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.8). After incubation for 2 hours at room temperature 
under shaking, 0.5mmol/L of S2444 (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) in 125μl assay buffer was 
added. Samples were measured on a Victor3V Multi-label counter (PerkinElmer, 
Massachusetts, USA) at wavelength 405nm every 5 min over a period of 60 min.

Fibrin zymography 
SDS-PAGE-based fibrin zymography1 was performed to evaluate plasminogen dependent 
fibrinolytic activity of the targeted and non-targeted scFv-scuPA. Briefly, the commercial uPA 
and scuPA were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels (see figure 
legends for concentrations). After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 
for 1.5 hour, then placed on top of a fibrin/agarose: plasminogen matrix. The matrix was 
prepared by first preparing a 10 ml solution of 2% low melting agarose in water (kept at 
45oC). 15ml of plasminogen depleted human fibrinogen (1% in imidazole buffer) was then 
prepared that also contained 24µl 25% TX-100 and 25µL human glu-plasminogen (1mg/ml). 
Thrombin (30µl of 100U/µl) was added to the fibrinogen solution to promote polymerization, 
then mixed and finally added to the agarose solution before being poured into gasket sealed 
glass plates (15 x 16cm) separated with 1.5mm spacers. The fibrinogen was allowed to 
polymerize at room temperature for ~2h. The glass plates were laid flat and the top plate 
removed. The washed SDS-PAGE gel was then overlaid onto the exposed agarose gel and 
incubated in a humidified 37°C oven until lytic zones were evident (usually overnight). 
Images were captured at various incubation times using a flatbed document scanner. 
Flow chamber adhesion assay  
Flow chamber in vitro adhesion assays were performed with glass capillaries or microfluidic 
flow channels, which were coated with 100μg/ml of collagen. After coating with collagen 
overnight, a syringe pump (PhD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, USA) was used in the aspiration 
mode to withdraw the whole blood through the capillaries or flow channels to form 
microthrombi. To observe the binding of scFv-scuPA to the platelet-rich microthrombi in the 
capillaries, the capillaries were perfused with PBS containing 100mg/L calcium chloride and 
100mg/L magnesium chloride. After washing, the syringe pump was used to withdraw the 
scFv-scuPA through the flow chamber at defined shear rates. The capillaries were then 
stained with anti-Penta-His AlexaFluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody. The 
microthrombi in the capillaries were visualized with the IX81 Olympus microscope and 
Cell^P 1692 software, using brightfield and fluorescence imaging with 20x objective. 
Fibrin degradation was monitored using microfluidic flow channels (300µm x 54µm x 22µm 
width x height x length). Whole blood, anticoagulated with 3.2% w/v citrate that was 
supplemented with 60µg/ml Oregon Green Fibrinogen (Invitrogen, USA), was perfused at 
1000s-1 for 6 min to generate microthrombi. On-chip microfluidic mixing was used to

reconstitute the citrate anticoagulated whole blood with 12mmol/L CaCl2, 6mmol/L MgCl2, 
600µg/ml thromboplastin (Thromborel S; Siemens healthcare, Germany) resulting in 
2mmol/L free calcium in the whole blood. Perfusion with reconstituted blood continued for 5 
min at 200s-1. Upon appearance of fibrin formation, 2µg/ml scFv-scuPA was added. The 
fibrin degradation were visualized with the IX81 Olympus microscope and Cell^P 1692 
software, using DIC and fluorescence imaging with 60x objective. Image analysis was done 
with ImageJ applying a median filter (1.5pixel) and a “fire” false color LUT (Look up table). 
False color LUT is achieved according to the fluorescence intensity of the image. 
In vivo mouse experiments  
Male C57BL/6 mice and plasminogen deficient (plg-/-) mice were assigned randomly to 
different groups. For thrombolysis, animals were injected with either commercial uPA, 
targeted scuPA (scFv
SCE5
-scuPA), non-targeted scuPA (scFv
mut
-scuPA) or saline as vehicle 
control after ferric chloride induced injury to the carotid artery. Animals for molecular 
ultrasound imaging were injected with targeted microbubbles directed against activatedplatelets
prior to thrombolysis treatment. The amount of commercial uPA or scFv-scuPA for 
injection was calculated according to units per gram (U/g) body weight of the animals. All 
experiments involving animals were approved by the Alfred Medical Research and 
Education Precinct Animal Ethics Committee. 
The animals were anaesthetized with ketamine (50mg/Kg, Parnell Laboratories, NSW, 
Australia) and xylazine (10mg/kg, Troy Laboratories, NSW, Australia). Fur was removed by 
shaving cream (Dove, Australia). Mice were placed on a 37°C heater mat to prevent 
hypothermia.  
Femoral vein catheterization  
An incision was made on the left limb of the animal to expose the femoral vein. A catheter 
was placed into the femoral vein to facilitate injection.  
Ferric chloride injury model for Doppler flow velocity measurement of the carotid 
artery 
Male C57BL/6 mice, 6 to 7 weeks of age (20 to 25 grams), were used for this model. An 
incision was made on the neck and the left common carotid artery was dissected from 
circumferential connective tissues. A small (1x2mm) filter paper saturated with 10% ferric

chloride was placed under the carotid artery of the animal for 3 min, to induce injury, which 
results in the formation of an occlusive thrombus. Treatment using commercial uPA, 
targeted scuPA (scFv
SCE5
-scuPA), non-targeted scuPA (scFv
mut
-scuPA), an equimolar 
concentration of scFvSCE5 alone, a combination of both scFvSCE5 and scFvmut-scuPA, or 
saline as vehicle control was injected, via the femoral vein catheter, 1 min before the injury. 
A nano Doppler flow probe (0.5VB, Transonic, Japan) was placed under the carotid artery 
post-injury and the carotid blood flow was measure by a flow meter (T106, Transonic, 
Japan) to determine thrombotic occlusion. Measurements of the Doppler velocities were 
monitored for 30 min. 
Intravital microscopy of the mesenteric arteries in mice  
Male C57BL/6 mice, 4 weeks of age (16 to 20 grams), were used for this model. Intravital 
microscopy was performed as previously described2. Briefly, the mesentery was exteriorized 
through a midline abdominal incision. Mesenteric arterioles (60–160 mm) were injured via 
microinjection of 6% FeCl3 into the tissue adjacent to the arteriole of interest with a micro 
injector needle (tip diameter 4–6 mm) which results in thrombi. ScFv-scuPA conjugated with 
Cy-3 NHS fluorescence dye (Lumiprobe, Florida, USA) were injected into the animal after 
the formation of thrombi. The accumulation of fluorescence labelled scFv-scuPA was 
observed using the fluorescence channel on the Nikon A1r Plus confocal microscope with 
40x objective.  
In vivo ultrasound molecular imaging of carotid artery thrombolysis  
Male C57BL/6 mice, 6 to 7 weeks of age (20 to 25 grams), were used for this model. 
Ultrasound of animals was performed with a Vevo770 high-resolution imaging system 
(VisualSonics Inc. Canada) using a 40 MHz RMV704 transducer. Animals were placed on 
the VisualSonics imaging station after 3 min, ferric chloride (6%) injury was performed to the 
left carotid artery. Videos and images were acquired before, during and at several time 
points after injecting 1.5x107 targeted microbubbles (LIBS-MBs). LIBS-MBs bound 
specifically to the ligand induced binding site (LIBS) expressed on activated GPIIb/IIIa upon 
platelet activation. We have recently demonstrated that these LIBS-MBs specifically bind to 
activated platelets in vitro in flow chamber adhesion assays, and allow non-invasive, realtime
molecular imaging of thrombosis via ultrasound3. We have also established the ability to 
monitor for the success or failure of pharmacological thrombolysis in vivo3. The targeted 
LIBS-MBs were injected, via the femoral vein catheter, in a total volume of 100μl. After

diagnostic imaging, we injected 500U/g BW of commercial urokinase plasminogen activator 
(uPA) (Medac, Germany), 75U/g BW of scFv-scuPA or saline as vehicle control. Repetitive 
ultrasound imaging sequences were performed every 5 min for an hour after thrombolysis. 
The acquired videos and images were then analyzed using a linear contrast agent imaging 
software (VisualSonics Inc.) 
In vivo ultrasound molecular imaging of carotid artery thrombolysis on plasminogen 
deficient animals  
Plasminogen deficient mice were placed on the VisualSonics imaging station after 6% ferric 
chloride injury was performed to the left carotid artery. Videos and images were acquired 
before, during and at several time points after injecting 1.5x107 targeted microbubbles (LIBSMBs
). Thereafter, we injected 75U/g of scFv
SCE5
-scuPA or scFv
mut
-scuPA. Repetitive 
ultrasound imaging sequences were performed every 5 min for 30 min. A bolus of 100µg/ml 
human glu-plasminogen (150µl) was injected at the 30 min time-point and repetitive imaging 
sequences continued for another 30 min. The acquired videos and images were then 
analyzed using a linear contrast agent imaging software.
