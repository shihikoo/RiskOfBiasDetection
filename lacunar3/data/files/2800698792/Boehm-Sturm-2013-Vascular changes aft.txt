During stroke, the reduction of blood flow leads to undersupply of oxygen and nutrients and, finally, to cell death,
but also to upregulation of pro-angiogenic molecules and vascular remodeling. However, the temporal profile of
vascular changes after stroke is still poorly understood. Here, we optimized steady-state contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (SSCE MRI) and followed the dynamic changes in vascular architecture for up to 4
weeks after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Using MRI diffusion measurements and the
changes of transversal relaxation rates ΔR
2
and ΔR

after injection of a superparamagnetic contrast agent, SSCE
MRI provided several hemodynamic parameters: relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), rCBV in small vessels,
microvascular density, and relative vessel size. Six rats underwent SSCE MRI before MCAO and at 7, 14, 21 and 28
days after surgery. 5-Bromo-20deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected between days 2 and 7 to label proliferating cells
during this time. SSCE MRI depicted a decrease in microvessel density and an increase in vessel size in the ischemic
striatum after stroke. A persistently decreased MRI vessel density was confirmed with histology at 28 days. BrdU +
endothelial cells were found in regions close to the infarct indicating endothelial cell proliferation during the
first week after MCAO; however, late-stage angiogenesis, as would be reflected by increased vessel density, was
not detected. The optimized SSCE MRI protocol was used to follow spatio-temporal changes of important vessel
characteristics, which may contribute to a better understanding of the role of angiogenesis at different stages after
stroke. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
Stroke is characterized by a disturbance in blood supply to the
brain. Reduction of blood flow results in widespread cell death,
but also activation of several molecules and signaling pathways
that are thought to promote angiogenesis, reviewed in (1–3).
Proliferating endothelial cells were first observed more than a
decade ago in human post mortem ischemic tissue (4), and
vascular casting in rodent models of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) illustrated the formation of vascular buds,
some of which appeared to anastomose with surrounding
vessels (5). However, it is not clear whether or not these new
vessels are functional, or whether they have the capacity to play
a role in stroke outcome.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been used to
observe alterations in cerebral blood supply following stroke.
While resolution is currently lacking to detect formation of new
microvessels directly, under the assumption that these vessels
are functional, MRI can, however, depict cerebral blood volume
(CBV) changes, which in turn can be used to noninvasively
estimate microvessel density and size, as reviewed in Neeman
et al. (6) and Seevinck et al. (7). Here, the term microvessel
usually refers to capillaries (5–10 mm diameter) in contrast to
large arteries and veins (~100 mm diameter). Although the
vascular tree may more accurately be described by self-similar
structures of a wide range of diameters, such simple categorization
into small and large vessels is under defined conditions
justified in the context of MRI signal from vasculature (8).
Steady-state contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(SSCE MRI) provides measures of blood volume, vessel size, and
vessel density by measuring relaxivity changes (ΔR

tissue following injection of an intravascular superparamagnetic
contrast agent (9–12).
Initial studies applying SSCE MRI in embolic stroke showed
that the microvascular density in the lesion core and adjacent
tissue decreased (13). However, another study reported an
increase in relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and density of
microvessels in cortical regions starting 14 days after permanent
distal MCAO, interpreted as late-stage angiogenesis by those
authors (14). Moreover, increased rCBV and vessel size were
found in the ischemic territory of rats after MCAO and were interpreted
as vasodilation in response to the stroke (15). Further
work is required to better understand the optimal acquisition
and analysis strategies for SSCE MRI in order to obtain deeper
insight into biological processes. In the present study, we
carefully refined the technique of SSCE MRI and applied it to
the monitoring of vascular changes for up to 4 weeks after
transient MCAO in the rat. The results were complemented with
an assessment of endothelial cell proliferation during the first
week after MCAO by histological means. Our ultimate aim was
to elucidate the extent of angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia,
which theoretically should be reflected by increased MRI-derived
vessel density.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Animals and experimental design
All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines
laid out in the German Animal Welfare Act and approved by
the authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz
Nordrhein-Westfalen) under permission number
9.93.2.10.31.07.048 (dated 22 May 2007). Adult male Wistar rats
(body weight 300–350 g, Harlan–Winkelmann GmbH, Borchen,
Germany) were housed in cages under a 12 h light/12 h dark
cycle with access to food and waterad libitum. During all surgical
and scanning procedures animals were anesthetized and maintained
with isoflurane in a 70:30 nitrous oxide–oxygen mixture,
and core body temperature was maintained at 36.7  1.0 C
using in-house automated feedback systems and heat blankets
(medres GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Animals were scanned with
MRI 4–7 days before and on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after MCAO,
and were sacrificed for histology after the last experimental
session. Additionally, rats received 5-bromo-20deoxyuridine (BrdU,
50 mg kg1 twice daily i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany)
between days 2 and 7 after MCAO to label proliferating cells.
2.2. Stroke induction
Stroke was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery via
intraluminalfilament technique (16) with the following modifications.
Rats were anesthetized and an incision was made in the
right temporal muscle halfway between the eye and ear. The
animals were subsequently placed in a supine position and a
calibrated 1 mm diameter Laser probe was placed against the
right skull to monitor cerebral blood flow changes in the sensorimotor
cortex followingfilament placement with a laser doppler
perfusion monitor (Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden). A midline incision
was made in the neck, and the mandibular glands, pretrachial
strap, and sternomastoid muscles were retracted. The carotid
artery and external carotid artery were exposed and ligated
with surgical sutures and a microclip was placed on the internal
carotid artery. A small incision was made in the carotid artery
below the external carotid artery and internal carotid artery
bifurcation and a silicone coated monofilament (410 mm diameter
, Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted and
advanced up the internal carotid artery until resistance was felt
and a decrease in cerebral blood flow noted (approximately 17
mm). After 60 min the filament was withdrawn, the suture on
the external carotid artery removed, muscles and glands guided
back into place, wounds sutured and treated with local anesthetic.
Animals received 2.5 ml of physiological saline s.c. daily
and were provided with moistened food until weight stabilized.
Exclusion criteria stipulated any animals with subarachnoid
hemorrhage, incomplete MCAO (no observable T
2
changes
during MRI 1 week after MCAO) were removed from the study.
Six rats entered the study, four of which had a lesion restricted
to the striatum, depicted as hyperintensities on T
2
maps; two
animals exhibited cortical and striatal damage. One animal did
not perform the SSCE MRI measurement 2 weeks post MCAO.
2.3. SSCE MRI
2.3.1. Theory
In order to analytically describe the changes in MRI signal owing
to i.v. injection of a paramagnetic substance, the vessel network
is modeled as a set of infinitely long, randomly distributed cylinders
(17,18). Proton spins are assumed to be restricted to one of
two compartments: either within vessels (intravascular) or within
the tissue surrounding the vessels (extravascular). Further
assumptions include a small blood volume fraction x
0
<<1
and a diffusion length much smaller than the size of a strongly
dephased area around the vessel, that is, dor2/D>>1 (8). D
represents the water diffusivity in the extravascular compartment
, r is the vessel radius, and do is the characteristic shift in
Larmor frequency of a magnetized cylinder in an external
magnetic field.
Under these assumptions, the change in MRI signal from
before (S
pre
) to after (S
post
) the contrast agent injection can
simply be described by shifts of the relaxation rates measured in
aspinecho(SE)(R

In order to assess the important tissue parameters T

and ΔR

simultaneously, we decided to use a multi spin echo pulse
sequence (MSME). This results in an effective reduction of the
diffusion effectD!D/n2 depending on the number of refocusing
pulses n (19,20).ΔR

Neglecting the reduced diffusion effect leads to a high underestimation

the experiment (Supporting Information, Fig. S1), which was
used for all further analysis. The deviation from the theory will
be subject to further studies.

Equations (1) and (2) show that ΔR
2
is a measure of rCBV
in small vessels whereas ΔR
2
reflects the rCBV in all vessels.
However, both still depend on the concentration C of the
contrast agent in blood, which usually needs to be assessed
invasively or with dynamic contrast-enhanced measurements
(11). Therefore, Jensen and Chandra introduced the so-called Q
-factor, which is largely independent of C and is a measure of
microvessel density (10).

Q relates to the number of vessels that punctuate a crosssection

in units of [N]=1 mm2 and can be calculated when the presence
of large macrovessels can be neglected and taking into
account the water diffusivity in tissue (12):

Owing to the lack of in vivo measurements of the contrast

= 6.64	104 mm2 s1 (21).
2.3.2. MRI acquisition
MRI was carried out on a 4.7 T animal scanner (Biospec47/30,
Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with actively
shielded gradient coils (BGA 12, 220 mT m1, 120 ms rise time,
Bruker BioSpin). We used a custom-built surface radiofrequency
coil 30 mm in diameter for reception and a Helmholtz coil for
homogeneous transmission (medres GmbH, Cologne, Germany).
Animals were fixed with tooth bar and ear bars in a custommade
animal holder (medres). Respiration rate was monitored
with a pressure-sensitive pad under the thorax using DASYlab
(Measurement Computing, Norton, USA) software.
The imaging protocol consisted of apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) measurement [spin echo MRI, field of view = (2.56 cm)2,
eight contiguous 1 mm thick slices, matrix = 128	64, echo time/
repetition time (TE/TR) = 40.66 ms/4 s, one diffusion direction
medial-lateral in the animal coordinate system, b
eff
= 0.26, 600.26,
and 1500.26 s mm2, Time of acquisition (TA) = 12:48 min], an
MSME (TE/TR= 13.55 ms/4 s, 10 echoes, TA= 8:32 min) and a
multigradient echo pulse sequence (MGE, TE/TR= 5 ms/2 s, eight
equidistant echoes,flip angle= 60,TA= 8:32 min). The geometries
of the MSME and MGE were matched to the ADC measurement to
allow voxel-wise calculation of vessel density, except that four
additional slices were acquired in order to cover the whole
forebrain in the T
2
and T
2
images.
After initial measurements, superparamagnetic iron oxide
particles (Endorem, Guerbet, Sulzbach, Germany, 11.2 mg
Fe ml1) were injected in the tail vein at a dose of 30 mg
Fe kg1 without moving the animal. We allowed the contrast
agent to distribute homogeneously over the blood pool for 3
min, and then identical post-contrast MSME and MGE images
were acquired.
2.4. MRI data processing
The MRI data were processed with Interactive Data Language
(IDL, ITT visual information solutions, Boulder, CO, USA) and
FMRIB Software Library (FSL, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).
ForT
2
maps, the MRI signalS(TE) in MSME scans wasfitted on a
voxel-wise basis with a monoexponential decay S(TE)=Aexp
(TE/T
2
)+B with equilibrium signal A, relaxation time T
2
, and
an offset B to reduce bias introduced by the use of magnitude
images (22). Accordingly, ADC maps were generated by fitting
the MRI signal with S(b)=Aexp(bADC)+B. Maps were coregistered
to a template rat brain (an average of 34 high-resolution
T
2
-weighted images from 28 rats, scaled to match the resolution of
our scans) with FSL’s linear registration tool.
For vessel size and density maps, theA
0
images (b=0.26smm2)
of the ADC scan and the first echo images of the pre- and
post-contrast MSME and MGE scans were segmented with
FSL’s brain extraction tool. The segmented images were coregistered
to the template brain with an affine transformation
(12 degrees of freedom) with FSL. The determined transformation
matrices were applied to the other ADC images, and the
later echoes of the MSME and MGE datasets. Finally, the coregistered
images were used for voxel-wise calculation of ΔR
2
,
ΔR
2
, Q, N and R according to equations (2)–(5) and (7), respectively. ΔR
2
and ΔR
2
were calculated from the second echo of
the MSME and MGE images, respectively, in order to minimize
error propagation in the data analysis scheme (Supporting
Information, Fig. S2). Voxels with a signal to noise ratio<5 in 
either the A
0
image of ADC measurements or in the first echo
of the MSME or MGE were excluded from the analysis. Voxels
with negative ΔR
2
or ΔR
2
values, or those with ΔR2 >ΔR
2
were
also excluded.
Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was carried out with the
freeware program ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ ij/). First, for
anatomically selected VOIs, the intact and ischemic striatum
was manually delineated in the coronal slices corresponding to
0.3 and 1.3 mm from bregma. Second, lesion-based VOIs
were manually drawn in the same two slices for each animal
on T
2
maps acquired 1 week post MCAO. The lesion-based VOIs
encompassed voxels with increased T
2
values (T
2
> mean + 2
standard deviations of contralateral striatum). Third, a VOI of
the peri-infarct zone was drawn by extension of the lesion VOI
by 0.4 mm in-plane (neglecting ventricles and areas outside
the brain) and by subsequent subtraction of the lesion VOI.
Mirroring of the lesion and peri-infarct VOIs at the midline with
a custom ImageJ macro yielded the contralateral VOIs. Mean

Q, N and R values were recorded and presented as a

The incidence maps were generated by normalization (voxelwise
division) of the post-MCAO parameter maps to the time point

before surgery. An incidence in a voxel at a certain time point was
counted when that voxel showed a significant increase/decrease,
that is, with a normalized parameter of interest larger/smaller
than the mean2 standard deviations when compared with
the contralateral striatum. For each SSCE MRI parameter increase/
decrease, incidences of all animals were added voxel-wise.
The resulting incidence map for the group of animals was
smoothed (Gauss filtered, sigma= 0.2 mm) and overlaid on the
template brain.
2.5. Immunohistochemistry
After the last MRI session, animals were deeply anesthetized and
perfused transcardially with cooled saline followed by cooled 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed overnight and cryoprotected
in 30% sucrose solution prior to coronal sectioning
at 40 mm on a freezing microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). Sections were kept at 20 C in cryo-protective
solution. For double-label immunofluorescence with BrdU, freefloating sections were denatured in 1 mol l1 HCl for 10 min at
65 C, followed by 20 min incubation at room temperature and
pre-incubation in appropriate blocking solution: 5% normal sera
and 0.25% Triton X-100 in potassium phosphate-buffered saline
for 60 min at room temperature. Incubation with primary
antisera was carried out overnight at +4 C and the following
primary antibodies were used: rat anti-BrdU (1:100, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), and mouse anti-Rat Endothelial Cell
Antigen (RECA; 1:400, AdB Serotec, Oxford, UK). Primary antibodies
were detected using either standard diaminobenzidine
(DAB) immunohistochemistry or appropriate fluorescent Cy3
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) or biotinconjugated
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) secondary
antibodies (1:200), the latter of which was detected with
Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Sections were mounted on poly L-lysine coated slides
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and coverslipped
with glycerol-based mounting medium.
Microscopic images were acquired and double-immunoreactivity
verified with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica
TCS SP5 X, Leica Microsystems). Microvessel density was semiquantified across the entire intact and ischemic striatum from
RECA DAB stained sections located approximately0.3 mm from
bregma (corresponding to the anterior commissure) (23) using
the Stereo Investigator system (MicroBrightField Europe, E.K.,
Magdeburg, Germany) with a counting frame of 40 mm2 at 20	
magnification. Microvessel size was estimated by measuring
the diameter at the thickest point of a counted vessel every
100 frames.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as group meansstandard deviation of the
means. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17
software and a p-value<0.05 was used as the significance level.
VOI values in the striatum/lesion/peri-infarct zone were compared
using one way repeated measures analysis of variance
with time as the within-subject factor followed by post-hoc
pairwise comparisons with the least significant difference test.
For comparison of histology and MRI, microvessel densities in
the intact and ischemic striatum were analyzed using paired
Student’s t-tests.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Impact of noise and echo times on SSCE MRI results
To determine the impact of noise on the most noise-sensitive
parameter N, we performed simulation experiments in which
white noise was added to artificial MRI datasets. In parallel we
analyzed histograms in experimental MRI datasets from animals
before MCAO. Our simulations also determined that suboptimal
echo times result in non-Gaussian, widespread distribution of
the resulting N values (Supporting Information, Fig. S2). From
this, we anticipated that, in order to detect physiologically
relevant changes in N (as a marker of microvessel density), the
relative change must be in the order of magnitude of 20%.
3.2. Impact of tissue water diffusivity on interpretation of
SSCE MRI results
In the chronic phase after MCAO, necrosis, phagocytosis and
associated cystic formation in tissue are visualized by a steep
increase in ADC values. In all animals with this cyst formation
(n= 3) regions of elevated ΔR
2
were observed within or close
to the lesion core (Fig. 1a). According to the theory, increases
in ΔR
2
indicate an increase of rCBV in small vessels, but as is
demonstrated by eqn (1), diffusivity also plays a role. Comparison
of vessel density maps calculated under inclusion of a
constant diffusion value from the literature (21) (Fig. 1b) with
those vessel density maps for which the local diffusivity was
taken into account on an experimentally recorded, voxel-wise
basis (Fig. 1c, d), revealed that the dominant effect leading to the
increased ΔR
2
was highly elevated water diffusivity in necrotic
tissue. Vessel staining on histological sections confirmed that
tissue in these regions was not intact at 4 weeks after MCAO
and that the density of small vessels in adjacent regions was
not higher compared with healthy tissue (Fig. 1e, f).
3.3. Vascular changes after stroke
3.3.1. MRI Incidence maps
Incidence maps revealed that decreases in ΔR
2
and Q and an
increase in R were most frequent (Fig. 2, bottom three rows).
All six animals were used for map calculations but the highest
number of incidences found in all pixels for any of the SSCE
MRI parameters was three, indicating a regionally and temporally
variable pattern of vascular changes across the different animals.
Other incidence maps did not show a specific trend.
3.3.2. MRI VOI analysis
Parameter maps from all animals are presented for all time
points in Fig. 3. In all maps except T
2
and ADC we observed
global image intensity fluctuations between animals and time
points within the whole brain that followed no defined pattern
and probably reflected differences in contrast agent concentration
within the blood, which was not measured in this study.
To account for this, quantitative analysis was carried out in the
striatum (Fig. 4a), within the lesion (Fig. 4b) and within the
peri-infarct areas (Fig. 4c), and values expressed as a percentage
ratio of the ipsilateral (lesioned) to the contralateral (intact)
hemisphere. Only a negligible number of voxels (<0.5 %) were
excluded from the analysis owing to the imposed thresholds
on signal to noise, ΔR
2
and ΔR

As expected, prior to MCAO the calculated MRI parameters
were comparable between the ipsilateral and contralateral side:
rCBV in small vessels ΔR
2
(striatum, 101.81.3%; lesion,
101.62.0%; peri-infarct, 98.52.6%), rCBV ΔR
2
(striatum,
100.54.5%; lesion, 103.98.2%; peri-infarct, 98.14.3%), microvascular
density index Q (striatum, 101.33.3%; lesion,
99.14.1%; peri-infarct, 99.72.8%), vessel density N (striatum,
103.89.0%; lesion, 98.317.3%; peri-infarct, 97.36.3%), and
relative vessel sizeR(striatum, 97.16.2%; lesion, 102.311.4%;
peri-infarct, 99.09.3%) (Fig. 4). After stroke, the overall rCBV
ΔR
2
remained relatively constant over the course of the experiments.
There was a significant effect of time in rCBV in small
vessels ΔR
2
[striatum, F(4,16) 3.890, p= 0.022; lesion, F(4,16)
6.082, p= 0.004; peri-infarct, F(4,16) 5.040, p= 0.008]. The
percentage ratio ofΔR
2
decreased around 1 week after stroke with
a trend towards subsequent increase by week 2, which was confirmed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons of values within the
lesion before and 1 week post stroke (p=0.05;Fig.4b).
Significant effects of time were also observed for the microvascular
density indexQ [striatum, F(4,16) 3.342, p=0.036; lesion,
F(4,16) 6.861, p=0.002; peri-infarct, F(4,16) 3.339, p=0.036],
microvessel density N [striatum, F(4,16) 3.586, p=0.029; lesion,
F(4,16) 6.311, p=0.003; peri-infarct, not significant], and relative
vessel size R [striatum, F(4,16) 3.259, p=0.039; lesion, F(4,16)
4.727, p=0.01; peri-infarct, not significant]. In line with the
decrease in rCBV in small vessels, Q and N ratios both decreased
around 1 week after stroke, although post-hoc tests failed to
reach significance. The decreases in N and Q at week 1 were
accompanied by a dramatic increase in relative vessel size R. This
persisted throughout the course of the experiments, although
less pronounced for later times.
3.4. Immunohistochemistry
RECA staining clearly detected blood vessels in the brain sections
4 weeks after surgery. Photomicrographs from two representative
animals indicate fewer visible vessels in the ischemic
striatum (Fig. 5a and b). Histological microvessel density in the ischemic
striatum was significantly lower than that of the intact
striatum (58589 vs 82758 vessels mm2) [ t(5) = 4.679,
p= 0.005). This corresponded roughly to a ~29% decrease
(Fig. 5c, right), which is within the detectability limits determined
from our simulations. A similar, significant decrease of ~27%
[t(5) = 2.705, p= 0.043) was observed in MRI-derived vessel
density N from the VOI analysis at 4 weeks after MCAO, that is,
(20981) mm2 ipsilateral and (28975) mm2 contralateral
(Fig. 5c, left). The mean vessel diameter, and thus size, measured
from brain sections in small vessels (<40 mm) were not significantly
different between the ischemic (7.41.0 mm) and the
intact striatum (7.01.0 mm; Fig. 5d, right). However, there was
a ~50% increase in R in the ischemic striatum determined from
the MRI VOI analysis, although this failed to reach significance
[t(5) =2.037, p= 0.097; Fig. 5d, left].
We systematically examined sections double-stained for BrdU
and RECA. No double-labeled cells were observed in the hemisphere
contralateral to the infarct, and green autofluorescence
within the ischemic core did not permit analysis there. However,
in peri-infarct regions we found occasional individual endothelial
cells that also appeared to be BrdU + (Fig. 6). Overall, very few
proliferating endothelial cells were detected.
4. DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that the temporal profile of
vascular changes after stroke can be assessed noninvasively with
SSCE MRI. However, our data indicate that it is crucial to optimize
MRI acquisition in order to maximize sensitivity of the method.
For the first time, we show that when cystic transformation
occurs, inclusion of diffusion measurements on a voxel-wise
basis is essential to prevent overestimation of SSCE MRI-derived
Figure 1. Impact of tissue diffusivity on MRI-derived blood volume and
vessel density. All animals with cyst formation exhibited regions with
highly elevated ΔR
2
close to or within the lesion core, which is usually
interpreted as high rCBV in small vessels. Such an area is indicated by
the box on the ΔR
2
map from a representative animal 4 weeks after
MCAO (a). Assuming a constant diffusivity value for each voxel that is
comparable to healthy tissue leads to high MRI-derived vessel densities
(box in b). However, ADC values in this region were also elevated, which
indicates necrosis and liquefaction of tissue (box in c). When we took
local tissue diffusivity into account on a voxel-wise basis, the ‘hot spots’
in the MRI-derived vessel densities disappeared (box in d). Histology in
the same region confirmed tissue necrosis (e) and a decrease in microvessel
density (e, arrows) compared with the same region on the contralateral
side (f). Thus, the high ΔR
2
was a result of high tissue diffusivity
and not an indicator of increased rCBV in small vessels.

parameters was three, that is, within any region, a significant, simultaneous vascular change occurred only in a subgroup of animals.

vessel densities. Our major finding was that there was a significant
decrease in rCBV in small vessels, leading to a decrease in
vessel density, which was accompanied by an increase in vessel
size 1 week after MCAO in the ischemic striatum that persisted
for several weeks. Microvessel density determination from histological
brain sections confirmed that decreased vessel density
was still present at 4 weeks after the initial insult. If large-scale
angiogenesis occurred in response to stroke, this should have
been reflected by an increase in vessel density. This was not
the case, although the presence of sparse numbers of BrdU+/
RECA + cells in the ischemic striatum indicated that some endothelial
cell proliferation occurred during the first week after
MCAO. Absence of double-labeled cells on the contralateral
hemisphere indicated that the proliferation was induced by the
stroke and not by natural turnover of endothelial cells.

to measure changes in the vascular network (rCBV in small vessels,

was assessed with a turbo
spin echo pulse sequence using multiple refocusing pulses to
speed up the acquisition (14). Subsequent studies employed multi
spin echo sequences in order to obtain measures of T

simultaneously and further included ADC measurements (13,24).
This strategy is useful as both T

information about the state of the ischemic tissue. However,
neither of these studies performed any modification to the theory
in order to account for the well-known reduction of the diffusion
effect on MR transverse relaxation (19,20,25). Using the theory
modification, however, leads to higherΔR
2
, Q and N values. In line
with this, we found higher values of these parameters compared
with the reports in which a theory correction was not applied.
Furthermore, we also identified a major pitfall in the interpretation
of SSCE MRI parameters when the tissue exhibits cystic transformation.
In such cases, ΔR
2
is no longer a good measure of rCBV in
small vessels, and neither isQbecause of elevated tissue diffusivity.
Our data indicate that it is essential to include local ADC values in
the calculations, otherwiseΔR
2
‘hot spots’ may be misinterpreted
as angiogenic activity.
Despite these improvements in MRI acquisition, our results
show that SSCE MRI is prone to noise, especially for the vessel
density estimate N. Even after optimization of acquisition parameters
, the relative error in N values is on the order of ~20%.
Although this is in accordance with the previous reports (13), it
represents an inherent limitation of the technique. Further
limitations come from the fact that the ischemic rodent brain
probably violates some of the previously described assumptions
that are made when applying the theory. For example, the
mathematical model underlying SSCE MRI only holds for impermeable
vessel walls, low blood volume fractions, and vasculature for
which the microvessels can be modeled as rigid long cylinders
(26). Therefore, the use of blood as an intravascular tracer through
the blood oxygen level-dependent contrast seems to be an
appealing alternative, e.g. to overcome problems of contrast agent
leakage and heterogenous water diffusivity in peri-infarct area.
Indeed, quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent approaches
have been developed in order to map important parameters of
oxygenation in vivo (27,28). Furthermore, the use of fast MR imaging
during the first bolus (dynamic susceptibility MRI) or arterial
spin labeling techniques could help to correlate SSCE MRI with
perfusion and thus functionality of blood vessels.
4.2. Vascular changes after stroke
Using SSCE MRI we observed a decrease in microvessel density
in the ischemic striatum at 1 week after stroke, a situation not
surprising as this tissue has experienced widespread cell death
by this time. Similarfindings were reported as early as 1 day after
ischemia in an embolic (13) and distal occlusion model (14). This
decrease in microvessel density persisted for up to 2 weeks in
the former study, which is also consistent with our results.
Figure 5. Comparison of MRI and histology. Tissue sections stained for vessels (RECA) of an animal with a small striatal lesion (a) and of a rat with a
larger infarct (b). Semi-quantification on histological sections revealed a significant ipsilateral decrease in microvessel density (c, right) that corresponded
well with the MRI results at 4 weeks after MCAO (c, left). Histological vessel diameter (of vessels<40mm) showed only a small, nonsignificant
increase in the ipsilateral striatum (d, right), whereas a highly elevated relative vessel size was found in the MRI analysis (d, left), although this failed to
reach significance. For better visualization, MRI and histology data are scaled differently. Values are expressed as group meansstandard deviation.

Despite the notion that the decrease in microvessel density
observed in the ischemic region after stroke is persistent, the
SSCE MRI study that employed the distal occlusion model noted
a significant increase in microvessel density in the outer cortex of
the ischemic region beginning after about 2 weeks that was
attributed to angiogenesis (14). One potential reason for this
discrepancy could be the choice of stroke model. However, our
findings suggest that this effect could be artifactual in nature as
we were able to observe a similar phenomenon in animals with
cystic transformation when we employed, rather than the correct
and necessary voxel-wise diffusion measurement, only a constant
diffusion value to determine N maps. Indeed and in line with this,
the authors of that study mentioned that this area of increased
microvessel density was prone to cystic transformation.
In parallel to the decrease in microvessel density, we observed
an increase in vessel size with SSCE MRI most pronounced at 7 days
post stroke that was probably due to vasodilation of arterioles in an
effort to maintain autoregulation. This phenomenon probably
occurs earlier, and, indeed, Lin et al. (14) reported this observation
within thefirst week of stroke (1–3 days), which was confirmed by
an increase in the number of vessels with a diameter greater than
30 mm in tissue sections from the same time period. While that
study reported a subsequent decline in vessel size, other groups
suggested that this effect remains between days 7 and 21 (15)
and even up to 6 weeks in the recovery region (24). In the present
study, we only measured animals up to 28 days, and while R was
still elevated at this time, this elevation was not as pronounced
as during the first week. In accordance with these findings, we
were also unable to observe an increase in the mean vessel
diameter in the ipsilateral when compared with the contralateral
striatum at 4 weeks post stroke. While it is possible that this could
be an artifact of our sampling strategy, microvessel is a gross term
that includes capillaries, venules and arterioles, which means that
the size of vessels varies considerably even in the intact brain
(29). Nevertheless, the mean vessel size estimated subcortically at
6 h post symptom onset was recently shown to be a good predictor
of final infarct size at 6 days in a small cohort of patients that
underwent a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced protocol similar
to SSCE MRI (30). A follow-up study extended the same protocol
to a larger patient cohort that presented a significant perfusiondiffusion
mismatch around 24 h post symptom onset (31). Vessel
size was found to be a poor predictor of infarct growth at 6 days,
but microvessel density proved to be useful at discriminating
infarcted from oligemic or healthy tissue. These studies highlight
the utility of this technique to provide valuable information in
the post-ischemic period.
4.3. Angiogenesis after stroke
Angiogenesis after ischemia is generally characterized at a cellular
level by gene transcription leading to expression of proangiogenic
molecules andfinally to endothelial cell proliferation.
We observed some endothelial cell proliferation during the first
post-operative week, which is already well described (5), and
another study observed increases in various pro-angiogenic
compounds such as growth factors and endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (14). While stabilization of vessel walls and formation
of new networks have been reported (5), it is unclear if these
processes can lead to truly functional new vasculature (7). Perfusion
measurements could help to elucidate if proliferating,
BrdU + endothelium belongs to functional vasculature. Unfortunately
, as SSCE MRI is based on CBV measurements using an
intravascular contrast agent, it is only capable of detecting
perfused vessels. The evidence from the preclinical SSCE-MRI
studies in stroke models consistently indicates that there is an
overall decrease in microvessel density rather than a large-scale
increase. The small number of animals in the present study
renders general conclusions difficult. However, taken together,
this implies that angiogenesis is not occurring at an advanced
level and that new, functional vessel formation is limited. The
histological evidence also supports this as measurements of
microvessel density in tissue sections decrease corresponding
to the same pattern in the MR images. From a translational point
of view this may be discouraging. However, chronic hypoxia
generally leads to angiogenesis and this has been shown for
human stroke (4). Therefore, discrepancies owing to choice of
species and model (transient ischemia in a specific rat strain
versus human stroke) should further be addressed.
5. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, SSCE MRI is a useful technique to noninvasively
estimate changes in the microvasculature after stroke. Our results
indicate that optimization of the MR acquisition parameters is
essential in order to allow robust conclusions. The focus of our
study in experimental stroke has been to probe for evidence
of angiogenesis in the chronic stages. Immunohistochemistry
revealed endothelial cell proliferation only in peri-infarct regions,
which is a sign for early angiogenesis, but newly formed endothelial
cells failed to translate into higher vessel densities and functional
vasculature.

RECA (red) and BrdU (green) 4 weeks after MCAO. BrdU was administered
between days 2–7 after MCAO. Overview (a) and higher magnification
images (b, corresponds to the white box in a) revealed some red/green
overlap and a confocal microscopy image (c, corresponds to the white
box in b) confirmed this. Strong green ipsilateral staining in the lesion
core (a) is due to ischemia-induced autofluorescence.
