Abstract
Previous studies have shown that fastigial nucleus stimulation
(FNS) reduces tissue damage resulting from focal cerebral
ischemia. Although the mechanisms of neuroprotection
induced by FNS are not entirely understood, important data
have been presented in the past two decades. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are a newly discovered group of non-coding small
RNA molecules that negatively regulate target gene expression
and are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and
cell apoptosis. To date, no studies have demonstrated
whether miRNAs can serve as mediators of the brain’s
response to FNS, which leads to endogenous neuroprotection.
Therefore, this study investigated the profiles of FNS-mediated
miRNAs. Using a combination of deep sequencing and
microarray with computational analysis, we identified a
novel miRNA in the rat ischemic cortex after 1 h of FNS. This
novel miRNA (PC-3p-3469_406), herein referred to as rnomiR-676-1
, was upregulated in rats with cerebral ischemia
after FNS. In vivo observations indicate that this novel miRNA
may have antiapoptotic effects and contribute to neuroprotection
induced by FNS. Our study provides a better understanding
of neuroprotection induced by FNS.
Keywords: deep sequencing, fastigial nucleus stimulation,

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disabilities in
the general population worldwide. Stroke poses especially
difficult challenges for the development and use of adjunct
therapies. Although numerous studies have been conducted,
the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained
remarkably limited (Sahota and Savitz 2011; Liu et al.
2012a). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator effectively
improves functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients
(Hussain et al. 2012). However, the strict time window of
4.5 h indicates that this therapeutic approach is underutilized.
Regeneration of the damaged brain occurs for
several days and weeks after a stroke event, which may
provide a second window for treatment. Therefore, a
substantial number of neuroprotective agents have been
designed to interrupt the ischemic cascade (Minnerup et al.
2012). Fastigial nucleus stimulation (FNS) is one promising
approach for the treatment of patients with ischemic brain
lesions (Golanov et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 2005; Zhang et al.
2008; Liu et al. 2012b; Mandel et al. 2012; Wang et al.
2014). The fastigial nucleus (FN) is located at the top of the
fourth ventricle and includes adrenergic intrinsic neurons and
nerve fibers. Stimulation of the FN for 1 h can ameliorate
brain injury caused by brain ischemia, and this protective
effect can be maintained until the tenth day when the middle

cerebral artery is occluded immediately after the stimulation
(Reis et al. 1998; Glickstein et al. 1999). In our previous
study, 1 h of electrical FNS reduced the volume of a focal
ischemic infarction produced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) by ~ 40%, and the apoptotic index in
the ischemic and penumbra areas was decreased (Liu et al.
2014).
Although the molecular factors that link FNS remain
unclear, the protective effect of FNS is mediated, at least in
part, via the suppression of apoptosis (Zhou et al. 2001).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered group of noncoding
small RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding
to complementary seed sequences in the 30-UTRs of target
mRNAs, which inhibit translation or promotes mRNA
degradation. miRNAs provide an additional level of regulation
for genes involved in diverse biological functions,
including apoptosis, cellular proliferation, and differentiation
(Bartel 2004, 2009; Shukla et al. 2011). The enormous
potential for the application of miRNAs in the diagnosis,
prognosis and therapy of various diseases has been partially
explored (Im and Kenny 2012; Wahidet al.2014). However,
whether miRNAs serve as mediators in the brain response to
FNS, which leads to endogenous neuroprotection, remains
unclear. Thus, we sought to determine the expression and
function of miRNAs in the ischemic cortex of rats after 1 h
of FNS.
Our study utilized an established focal cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) model in rats. We examined the global
profile of miRNAs in the ischemic cortex after I/R injury
following a 1-h electrical FNS using deep sequencing. We
used the sequencing data to develop a custom miRNA
microarray. Our results demonstrate that many miRNAs,
including several novel miRNA candidates, exhibited significantly different expressions in the ischemic cortex after a
1-h electrical FNS compared with the non-FNS group. We
subsequently investigated one of the novel miRNA candidates
and verified its function based on bio-informatic
analyses and a series of experiments.
Methods
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–300 g) were purchased from the
Animal Experiment Center of Guangxi Medical University. Animals
were handled according to the guidelines of the Council for
International Organization of Medical Sciences on Animal Experimentation
(World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland). The
Guangxi Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee
approved the animal protocols. During the surgery, the rats were
anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 3.5% chloral hydrate (1.0 mL/
100 g; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All efforts were made to
minimize suffering. After the surgery, the animals were allowed to
recover from the anesthesia and were returned to their home cage
with ad libitum access to food and water.
Electrical stimulation of the FN and transient focal cerebral
ischemia
The FN was accurately targeted using a stereotaxic atlas of the rat
brain. The posterior border of bregma was set as the zero point, and a
hole (1.1 mm lateral, 11.1 mm posterior, 5.6 mm deep) was made for
electrode attachment. A YC-2 programmed electrical stimulation
instrument (Chengdu Instrument Factory, Chengdu, China) was used
to apply a 70-lA direct-current square-wave pulse (50 Hz). Each
electrical stimulation lasted 1 h. An established focal cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model was employed 24 h later. Focal
cerebral ischemia was produced by 2 h of MCAO using a nylon
monofilament suture, as previously described (Longa et al. 1989).
The duration of reperfusion was 24 h. Rats in the sham-operated
group underwent only vascular separation withoutfilament insertion.
Small RNA library preparation and sequencing
After 1 h of FNS in rats subjected to 2 h of MCAO and 24 h of
reperfusion, brain tissue sections (approximately 2 mm thick) from
the point behind the optic chiasm in the ipsilateral cortex were
quickly dissected and harvested on ice. Total RNAs were extracted
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer’s procedure. The quantity and purity of total RNA
were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano Lab
Chip Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with RIN number > 7.0.
RNA molecules were ligated to 50 and 30 adaptors sequentially and
converted to cDNA by reverse transcription followed by PCR
amplification. The cDNA constructs were purified by gel purification.
A small RNA library was prepared using a TruSeq Small RNA
Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The purified cDNA library was used for
cluster generation on Illumina’s Cluster Station, and single-end
sequencing (36 bp) was performed on an Illumina Hiseq2500 at the
LC-BIO (Hangzhou, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions
for instrument use.
Small RNA analysis and prediction of novel miRNAs
Briefly, raw reads were subjected to the Illumina pipeline filter
(Solexa 0.3), and the data set was further processed for sequencing
data analysis using a proprietary pipeline script, ACGT101-miR (LC
Sciences, Houston, TX, USA). Following the removal of adapter
sequences, low-quality reads and common RNA families (rRNA,
tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA), unique sequences of 18 and 26 bases
were mapped to species-specific precursors in miRBase 20.0 using a
BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5pderived
miRNAs. The remaining sequences were mapped to other
mammalia’ precursors in miRBase using further BLAST searches.
The unmapped sequences were analyzed to predict potential novel
miRNAs. We performed a BLAST search against the Rattus
norvegicus genome, and the sequences that contain hairpin RNA
structures were predicted from the flanking 80-nt sequences using
RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi).
Target prediction and gene ontology analysis
The putative targets were predicted using FindTar (http://
bio.sz.tsinghua.edu.cn/) software to better understand the functions
of the novel miRNAs. We predicted potential binding sites for
miRNAs in large target mRNAs by identifying the most energet-

ically favorable hybridization site between two sequences. We
performed gene enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO)
categories (http://www.geneontology.org/) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/
pathway.html) to identify pathophysiologically important gene
groups.
Dual-luciferase reporter assays
HEK293 cells (49 103 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well plate
1 day before transfection. Cells were co-transfected with 50 nM of
novel miRNA mimics or Ncontrol and 40 ng of pmiR-RBREPORTTM Luciferase vector that included the 30-UTR of binding
sites of the predicted target gene (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. HEK293 cells were
collected 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were
performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to
firefly luciferase activity. Transfections were performed in triplicate
and repeated at least three times in separate experiments.
Intracerebroventricular infusion
One day prior to I/R injury, intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion
was performed as previously described (Krutzfeldtet al.2005). Rats
were anesthetized and fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A microsyringe
was stereotaxically implanted into the left lateral ventricle of
the brain (relative to bregma: 1.5 mm lateral, 1.1 mm posterior,
4.5 mm deep) and affixed to the skull. Continuous ICV infusion of
miR-676-1 antagomir, antagomir-negative control, agomir, or
agomir-negative control (0.2 nmol/lL, total 5 lL, at a rate of
1 lL/10 min) was initiated 1 day prior to MCAO and reperfusion.
The microsyringe was maintained in situ for an additional 5 min
following the injection, and the needle was removed. Antagomirs
and agomirs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(RiboBio, Guangzhou, China). All antagomirs and agomirs were
dissolved in normal saline before injection. The rats underwent 2 h
of MCAO and 24 h of reperfusion after ICV infusion and were then
analyzed via TTC staining, RT-qPCR, and apoptosis assays.
Evaluation of neurological function scores and cerebral infarct
volumes
Rats were tested for neurological deficits after 2 h of MCAO and
24 h of reperfusion and scored on a 5-point scale (Zhu et al. 2014):
0, no observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend
right forepaw (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side (moderate);
3, falling to the right (severe); 4, mice could not walk spontaneously
and showed a depressed level of consciousness (very severe).
Rats were deeply anesthetized after neurological examination, and
brains were perfused with normal saline via transcardiac perfusion.
Brains were quickly removed and sliced into six coronal sections (2-
mm thick) using a rat brain matrix. Infarct volume was measured
using TTC staining. Slices were stained with 2% TTC (Sangon
Biotech, Shanghai, China) for 15 min at 37°C in the dark and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline.
Stained slices were photographed with a digital camera and analyzed
with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD,
USA). The percentage of the infarct volume was calculated as a
percentage of the contralateral hemisphere using the following
formula: 1009 (contralateral hemisphere volume  non-infarct
ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume
(Yin et al. 2010).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the ipsilateral cortex of the I/R injury
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse
transcription and PCR were performed using the PrimeScript
miRNA qPCR Starter Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). Equal amounts of
total RNA (1 lg) were reverse-transcribed in 10 lL 2 9 miRNA
Reaction Buffer Mix (for Real Time), 2 lL 0.1% bovine serum
albumin, 2 lL miRNA PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix, and RNasefree
dH2O up to 20 lL with the following protocol: 37°C for
60 min, 85°C for 5 s and hold at 4°C. PCR was performed with a
first denaturation step at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, and annealing and extension at 65°C
for 30 s. Melting curve analysis was performed using the following
parameters: 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 20 s. Each PCR mixture
contained 2 lL RT reaction product, 10 lL SYBR Premix Ex
TaqTM II (29), 0.8 lL qPCR Primer Mix, and RNase Free dH
2
O
up to 20 lL. Relative miRNA levels were normalized using U6 as
the internal control. PCR experiments were performed in triplicate in
three separate experiments in a Light Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR
System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
TUNEL assay
Brain tissue (approximately 2-mm thick) samples were obtained
from two points, anterior and posterior to the optic chiasm, after
intracardiac PFA perfusion. Brain specimens were individually
immersed in 4% PFAfixative for 24 h and embedded in paraffin for
the slicing of 3-lm sections. TUNEL analysis was performed
according to the protocol supplied with the TUNEL-POD kit (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). TUNEL-positive apoptotic
cells displayed brown nuclear or cytoplasmic staining. Five random
views under a high magnification microscope (9400) were chosen
in the infarct region and surrounding tissue. The index of apoptosis
for brain tissue was calculated based on the percentage of positive
apoptotic cells. Two researchers who were blinded to the experimental
conditions performed cell counting.
Statistical analysis
All data represent at least three independent experiments, and the
numbers of animals are indicated in the figure legends. Data are
reported as the means  SD. Statistical significance was determined
using t-tests to compare two groups or ANOVA followed by the
Newman–Keuls post hoc test for experiments with more than two
groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Cloning and identification of a novel miRNA from the rat
ischemic cortex after FNS
A cDNA library of small RNAs was prepared from the rat
ischemic cortex tissue after 1 h of FNS. A total of 7 705 444
raw sequences of small RNAs were obtained using Solexa
deep sequencing (Illumina). Adapter sequences and lowquality
reads were removed, and clean reads (5 570 313

mappable reads) of 18 and 26 bases in length were processed
for sequencing analysis (Fig. 1a and b). All classified
miRNAs (2687 total) are summarized in Table S1. According
to the standard criteria for novel miRNA identification,
extended sequences at the aligned genome locations have a
propensity to form hairpin structures. A total of 325
novel miRNA candidates were predicted. We used the
custom miRNA microarray made by LC Sciences to verify
the existence of the predicted miRNAs and measure the
expression levels of these novel miRNA candidates. The
microarray data are shown in Figure S1. PC-3p-3469_406
was significantly expressed in all 10 samples (Figure S1),
which further supported this candidate as a novel rat
miRNA.
The mature miRNA sequence of PC-3p-3469_406 was 50-
CCGUCCUGAGCUUGUCGAGC-30. Figure 2(a) shows the
hairpin structure predicted with RNAfold software. PC-3p-
3469_406 was located on chromosome Xq22 at sites
71080182–71080201 (Fig. 2b) and transcribed from the
intergenic region, which was confirmed by NCBI BLAST
analysis. BLASTing the novel miRNA sequence in miRBase
20.0 revealed that PC-3p-3469_406 and mmu-miR-676
differed by two nucleotides, neither of which lies in the
seed sequence region. This evidence suggested they are most
likely homologous genes. Sequence alignment results demonstrated
that PC-3p-3469_406 homologs also exist in
humans, Macaca mulatta, Gorilla gorilla, Sus scrofa, Pongo
pygmaeus, and Pan troglodytes, but with variations in
several nucleotides (Fig. 2c). Therefore, we temporarily
named this novel miRNA miR-676-1. Real-time PCR was
performed to characterize the expression profile of this
miRNA in various tissues, including the brain, heart, liver,
spleen, lung, kidney, testis, intestine, and muscle. We found
that miR-676-1 was preferentially expressed in muscle and
brain (Fig. 2d).
Expression of the novel miR-676-1 in the I/R rat cortex
after FNS
We induced a cerebral I/R injury model and conducted a 1-h
electrical FNS to identify whether the novel miR-676-1
participated in post-FNS. The expression levels of miR-676-
1 in the I/R and I/R after FNS groups were confirmed using
quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the sham-operated
and I/R-only injury groups, miR-676-1 expression was
significantly increased after FNS (p < 0.01). This finding
indicates that miR-676-1 levels are up-regulated in the I/R rat
cortex after FNS (Fig. 3).
miR-676-1 reduces cerebral I/R injury

injury in vivo (Fig. 4a). The over-expression of miR-676-1
alleviated the cerebral ischemic damage and decreased the
infarct volume 24 h after reperfusion following MCAO
compared with the agomir-control-injected group (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 4b and c). Furthermore, the neurological scores were
reduced compared to the agomir-control-injected group;
however, this change was not significant (Fig. 4d). Additionally
, we performed TUNEL staining to identify cells
undergoing apoptosis and determined that the number of
TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in the rat
brains injected with miR-676-1 agomir compared with the
agomir-control-injected rats (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4e and f). In
contrast, the knockdown of miR-676-1 enhanced the cerebral
ischemic damage and increased the infarct volume
(p < 0.05) (Fig. 4b and c). Furthermore, the number of
TUNEL-positive cells was significantly increased compared
with the antagomir-control-injected group (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 4e and f). The neurological scores were also increased
compared to the antagomir-control-injected group; however
, there was no significant difference between the
antagomir-injected and antagomir-control-injected groups
(Fig. 4d). These results demonstrated that miR-676-1 overexpression
protects against I/R-induced cellular damage, and
the inhibition of miR-676-1 enhances I/R injury in vivo.
Target prediction and functional annotation for the novel
miRNA
We predicted the target genes of miR-676-1 based on
complementary matches between the seed region of the novel
miRNA and the 30-UTRs of all rat genes using FindTar
prediction software to characterize the function of this novel
miRNA. We identified 2476 potential target sites for the
novel miR-676-1. To annotate the potential target genes, we
used the GO and KEGG databases and searched the literature
for information about the functions of each gene. We and
others have shown that apoptosis controls the post-FNS
pathophysiologic processes (Liu et al. 2014; Wang et al.
2014). Hence, we focused on the genes assigned to the GO
term ‘regulation of apoptosis’ and ‘cell death’or were related
to KEGG terms ‘apoptosis’, ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’,

and ‘MAPK signaling pathway’. Based on the criteria,
AUP1, CCNJ, PDPK1, BCL2L2, and HRAS were chosen for
testing as potential targets of the novel miRNA using a dualluciferase
reporter assay. To validate the miR-target relationship
, we co-transfected the wild-type target gene 30-UTR
vector with miRNA mimics or Ncontrol in HEK293T cells.
The miRNA binding site completely eliminated the inhibition
of luciferase activity of the miRNA mimics. AUP1,
HRAS, and BCL2L2 exhibited significant decreases
(p < 0.05); however, all genes exhibited weak (~ 15%)
repression (Fig. 5). These data indicate that miR-676-1 does
not bind to the 30-UTR to regulate these genes.
Discussion
Neuroprotection is a suitable therapy for stroke. FNS confers
protection against cerebral ischemia. In our previous study,
neuroprotection was considered to be involved in the
inhibition of neuronal apoptosis (Liu et al. 2014). Recently,
increasing attention has been focused on miRNAs, which are
promising targets in the molecular mechanisms of gene
regulation, pathology, and drug actions (De Santa et al.
2013). To date, the mechanisms underlying miRNA regulation
of neuroprotection induced by FNS remain unknown.
Our study presented the first profile of miRNA expression in
the ischemic cortex after 1 h of FNS. Many known and
novel miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression.
We hypothesize that these miRNAs serve as mediators
of the brain’s response to FNS that leads to endogenous
neuroprotection. Therefore, the identification and functional
analysis of the novel miRNA described here will prove
important for the understanding of the biological processes
following FNS.
Strict criteria were applied to define the FNS-relative novel
miRNA candidates in this study. We used small RNA
libraries, deep sequencing, and computational analysis in
combination with in vivo experiments to identify a novel
miRNA in the rat ischemia cortex after 1 h of FNS. This
novel miRNA, which is temporarily referred to as rno-miR-
676-1, is located on chromosome X and transcribed from an
intergenic region. The approximately 70-nt miR-676-1
precursor exhibits secondary folding structure. The mature
sequence of miR-676-1 is conserved in mammals. Based on
the standard criteria for new miRNA identification (Ambros
et al. 2003; Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones 2014; Yoo et al.
2014), we believe that miR-676-1 is a true miRNA.
Many studies have confirmed that neurons undergo
necrotic and apoptotic cell death after ischemic stroke events
(Love 2003; Yuan 2009). miRNAs serve as effectors in
apoptosis following ischemic stroke by negatively regulating
pro-apoptotic or antiapoptotic genes. To date, several
miRNAs, including miR-21 and miR-210, have been
reported as antiapoptotic molecules, whereas miR-124,
miR-181, and miR-29 promote apoptosis (Guan et al.
2012; Ouyang et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013; Qiu et al.
2013; Francis et al.2014). The present study investigated the
function of miR-676-1 in ischemic brains via in vivo
observation. We altered the brain levels of miR-676-1 via
ICV infusion of an miR-676-1 agomir or antagomir and
evaluated the neurological outcome. We demonstrated that
miR-676-1 over-expression was associated with a decreased
infarct volume and apoptotic index in the cortex after
transient focal cerebral ischemia, whereas the knockdown of
miR-676-1 in the brain increased the infarct volume and
apoptotic index. Furthermore, the neurological scores after
cerebral ischemia also changed. However, because the
neurological scores were obtained from a simple scale and
the sample number was less, the changes in scores were not
significant. We determined that the delivery of agomir
improved neurological outcomes, whereas the reduction in
miR-676-1 exhibited the opposite effect. This evidence
suggests a potential neuroprotective role for miR-676-1 in
I/R injury.
miRNAs contribute to biological processes by targeting
mRNAs for degradation or suppressing protein expression
(Bartel 2009). Recently, several programs, such as Target-
Scan, miRanda, and PicTar, have been developed as very
useful tools for the prediction of target genes; however, these
programs cannot be used for unknown miRNAs (Bentwich
2005). Therefore, we identified perfect base pairing between
the ‘seed’ sequencing of the novel miRNA and the target
sites of the predicted target genes using FindTar prediction
software (Lee et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013). Bioinformatics
analysis using the GO and KEGG databases was
conducted to predict target genes that might be involved in
FNS-induced neuroprotection. We focused on five important
apoptosis-related target genes, AUP1, CCNJ PDPK1,
BCL2L2, and HRAS. GO annotations related to PDPK1,
HRAS, and BCL2L2 indicate regulation of apoptotic
process. In addition, PDPK1 and HRAS are integral to the

function of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and MAPK
signaling pathway, which have been shown to be involved in
the pathogenesis of ischemic injury via regulation of
apoptosis (Yuan et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2013). Although
studies of AUP1 and CCNJ have not shown a direct anti- or
pro-apoptosis role, these genes are associated with cell
survival and G2/M arrest (Abeliovich 2007; Feliciano et al.
2013), which might play a role in post-FNS effects. Hence,
they were selected for further evaluation via a dual-luciferase
reporter assay. The results indicated that miR-676-1 did not
repress luciferase activity in the HEK293T cells transiently
co-transfected with miR-676-1 mimics and the Luc-target
gene compared with the cells transfected in the Ncontrol
group. These data indicated that miR-676-1 does not bind to
the 30-UTR to regulate these genes. Therefore, these five
genes are not the real target genes of miR-676-1. In the
future, we will continue to predict the target genes and
elucidate the regulatory networks of miR-676-1 using in vivo
experiments.
Conclusions
In conclusion, FNS induces a distinct miRNA expression
pattern. The miRNAs that are associated with FNS may
therefore exert regulatory effects in the brain after electrical
stimulation of the FN. Notably, we identified and characterized
a novel miRNA, rno-miR-676-1, in the rat ischemic
cortex tissue after FNS. We demonstrated that miR-676-1
was up-regulated after 1 h of FNS. In addition, treatment
with miR-676-1 reduced brain infarction and neural apoptosis
indexes after focal ischemia. These data suggest that miR-
676-1 acts as a novel antiapoptotic regulator and contributes
to FNS-induced neuroprotection. Modulation of miR-676-1
expression may serve as a novel strategy for ischemic stroke
therapy. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to confirm
its target genes. Additional research is required to identify the
target genes of miR-676-1.
