to lethal levels of NMDA or OGD. Lck gene silencing using siRNA abolished tolerance against both stimuli. Lck/ mice or neurons
isolated from Lck/mice did not exhibit PC-induced tolerance. An Lck antagonist administered to wild-type mice significantly attenuated
the neuroprotective effect of PC in the mouse focal ischemia model. Using pharmacological and gene silencing strategies, we also
showed that PKCis an upstream regulator of Lck, and Fyn is a downstream target of Lck. We have discovered that Lck plays an essential
role in PC in both cellular and animal models of stroke. Our data also show that the PKC-Lck-Fyn axis is a key mediator of PC. These
findings provide new opportunities for stroke therapy development.
Introduction
Ischemic tolerance induced by preconditioning (PC) is an endogenousprotectivemechanismwherebyshortexposuretosublethal
levels of a noxious stimulus results in protection from subsequent
more severe levels of exposure to the stimulus (Zemke et al., 2004;
Obrenovitch, 2008). PC occurs in a variety of organs including
the heart and brain (Lo et al., 2003). Numerous preclinicalinvitro
andin vivomodels of PC are available, and clinical data supporting
preconditioning in human diseases also exist. For example,
transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), caused by brief periods of interruption
in blood flow to the brain, are associated with decreased
stroke severity and improved outcome (Moncayo et al.,
2000; Dirnagl et al., 2009). To date, all acute neuroprotective
stroke therapies have failed in clinical trials, and, consequently,
no neuroprotective therapies for acute stroke exist. An alternative
strategy to reduce stroke severity may involve enhancing endogenous
neuroprotection such as PC (Fisher and Ratan, 2003;
Dirnagl et al., 2009). Although several mediators of PC have been
proposed, such as hypoxia-inducible factor, heat shock proteins,
erythropoietin, and ion channels (Kennedy and Buchan, 2005;
Malhotra et al., 2006; Obrenovitch, 2008; Dirnagl et al., 2009), the
exact mechanisms that mediate preconditioning are not yet fully
understood.
Lymphocyte cell kinase (Lck), a member of the Src family
kinases, has been shown to mediate diverse cellular pathways
including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and cell
death in many different cell types (Salmond et al., 2009). Previous
studies using Lck knock-out mice demonstrated that Lck gene
deletion abolished the cardioprotective effect of PC in myocardium
(Ping et al., 1999, 2002). Although, Lck is expressed in the
brain (Omri et al., 1996; Salter and Kalia, 2004), its role in neuroprotection
and PC has not been previously investigated.
We investigated the role of Lck in PC in the brain usingin vitro
andin vivoischemia models and show that Lck is a critical mediator
of PC in brain. Furthermore, we show that Lck-associated
PC is mediated through its interaction with PKCand activation
of another Src kinase, Fyn. In this study, we provide new insights
into the mechanisms underlying endogenous neuroprotection,
and suggest a novel therapeutic candidate pathway for stroke
prevention or treatment.

Primary cortical neuronal cultures. All animal procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
Michigan State University. Primary cortical neuronal cultures were established
as previously described (Yim et al., 2010). Briefly, cerebral cortices
were isolated from C57BL/6 newborn mice at postnatal day 0 and
dissociated in dissection media (81.8 mMNa

phenol red, pH 7.6) supplemented with 4 mML-cysteine, 10 U/ml papain
(Worthington), and 1000 U/ml DNase (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C. After
dissociation, cells were washed with Neurobasal A and then triturated
with pipette. Cells (1106) were plated onto poly-D-lysine-precoated 12
well plates. Three days after plating, 50% of the medium was changed,
and subsequently replaced every 3 d. Neuronal cultures were maintained
in CO
2
incubator (5% CO
2
/ 95% air balance) at 37°C, and used between
daysin vitro(DIV) 7 and 11.
Determination of NMDA-induced cytotoxicity. Delayed NMDA-
induced cytotoxicity was measured at 24 h after NMDA exposure using
PI-staining or LDH assay as previously described (Tauskela et al., 2003;
Wetzel et al., 2008). On DIV 9, cultured neurons were exposed to NMDA
for 20 min and maintained in CO
2
incubator for 24 h. Cells were stained
with 5g/ml PI at 37°C for 30 min, and examined by fluorescent microscopy
(Nikon) or fluorescent microplate reader (Ascent, Thermo Lab
Systems). The extent of LDH leakage was measured in conditioned media
using a Cytotox 96 Non-Radioactive cytotoxicity assay. The cell viability
in sister cells treated with 100MNMDA was used as the total cell
death (100%).
In experiments with NMDA-induced PC, cells were exposed to sublethal
dose of NMDA (10 M) for 20 min on DIV 8, and subsequently
exposed to lethal dose of NMDA (50M) at 24 h after PC on DIV 9. Cell
viability was measured as described above on DIV 10.
PKC activity modulating peptides. The peptide inhibitor for PKC
translocation (EAVSLKPT; V1-2) (Chen et al., 2005) and PKCselective
agonist (HDAPIGYD;RACK) (Inagaki et al., 2005) were synthesized
by Macromolecular Structure Facility (Department of Biochemistry,
Michigan State University). V1-2 or RACK was diluted and mixed
with BioPORTER reagent (Alano et al., 2010). Cells were incubated with
BioPORTER-peptide complex for4hat37°C. After transfection, cell
were washed with complete culture media and immediately exposed to
NMDA. Cell transfection efficiency was confirmed using parallel transfectionswithfluorescein-labeledcontrolIgG
,assuggestedbythemanufacturer.
Gene silencing with siRNAs.Primary cortical neurons were transfected
with 10 nMsiRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Ueda
et al., 2007). On DIV 5, neurons were incubated with Neurobasal A
containing Lipofectamine 2000 (0.2%) and 10 nMsiRNAs against mouse
Lck, Yes, or Fyn, or nontargeting negative control for4hat37°C. After
transfection, the original medium collected before transfection was replaced.
To ensure gene silencing efficiency, target mRNA or protein samples
were collected after 48 and 96 h after siRNA transfection, and
measured by quantitative real time PCR or Western blot, respectively.
Immunoprecipitation. Neuronal lysates were applied to immunoprecipitation
using magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) (Gudz et al.,
2006). Cell lysates were harvested using RIPA buffer, and centrifuged at
14,000gfor 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA
assay, and then adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Five hundred microliters of lysates
were applied to immunoprecipitation using specific anti-Lck or Fyn Abconjugated
magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). Eluted immunoprecipitates
were used for kinase assay or Western blot.
Lck/Fyn kinase activity. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Lck or
Fyn Ab, eluted immunoprecipitates were analyzed using a ProFluor Src-
Family Kinase Assay (Watanabe et al., 2010). The total kinase amounts in
immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot, and the kinase activity
from the corresponding control was defined as one-fold.
Western blot. After the cell lysate was collected using RIPA buffer
supplemented with Halt protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture, the
protein concentrations were determined using BCA assay. The protein
samples (20 g/lane) were separated in 12% Tris-HCl SDS-
polyacrylamide Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) and were transferred to PVDF
membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% BSA, membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies of anti-Lck (1:1000),
anti-Fyn (1:500), anti-p-Src/Fyn (1:1000), anti-PKC(1:1000), anti-Yes
(1:1000), anti-GAPDH (1:5000), or anti--actin (1:5000). Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, Cell Signaling
Technology) were used as secondary antibodies. The immune complexes
were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West
Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate. Bands were quantified by NIH ImageJ
program, and normalized by the corresponding loading controls of
-actin or GAPDH. All immunoblots were repeated for at least three
independent experiments.
Quantitative real time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen), and converted into cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems) for quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR
). The specific primer sequences were as follows: 18S, forward: ACC
GCA GCT AGG AAT AAT GGA; reverse: GCC TCA GTT CCG AAA
ACC A; Lck, forward: TGG AGA ACA TTG ACG TGT GTG; reverse:
ATC CCT CAT AGG TGA CCA GTG; and Fyn, forward: ACC TCC ATC
CCG AAC TAC AAC; reverse: CGC CAC AAA CAG TGT CAC TC.
Quantification of gene copies was performed on the 7500 Real-Time
PCR system, using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR
cycles consisted of three stages with an initial step at 95°C for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, and a final stage
for dissociation curve. Relative mRNA expressions were calculated by the
comparative C
T
method (2Ct), and normalized to the endogenous
18S control.
Oxygen glucose deprivation. Oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) on
primary cortical neurons was performed as previously described (Plesnila
et al., 2001; Wetzel et al., 2008). On DIV 9, cells were washed, and the
medium was replaced by glucose free Earl’s balanced salt solution (5.4

LDH assay as described above. To induce OGD-PC, cells were exposed to
sublethal OGD for 30 min on DIV 8, and lysed for Western blot/kinase
assay or further exposed to lethal OGD for2honDIV9forcytotoxicity
assay.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.All animal procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of the Michigan State University. Focal ischemia was induced by permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in male C57BL/6 mice
(22–27 g; Charles River Laboratory) as previously described (Rajanikant
et al., 2007). Mice were kept under isoflurane anesthesia during the entire
procedure and their body temperature was maintained at 37°C. A skinincision
was made to create a small subtemporal craniotomy to expose
the middle cerebral artery, and the artery was occluded using a bipolar
coagulator. To ensure the completeness of the occlusion, the cerebral
blood flow in the MCA territory was measured before and after MCAO
by a laser doppler (Perimed PF-3). After incision closure, the animals
were allowed to recover from the anesthesia. At 24 h after pMCAO,
animals were killed, and then the brains were removed and sliced into 1
mm coronal sections, and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chlo-

ride (TTC) solution (Ruscher et al., 2011). The infarct area was measured
using the NIH ImageJ program from the scanned images of stained brain
slices. The infarct volume in each slice was calculated by taking the average
of the infarct areas on both sides of the slice and multiplying it by the
section thickness.
In vivo preconditioning. PC was induced 48 h before pMCAO by exposing
the animals for2htoacontinuously flushed gas mixture of 8%
oxygen/92% nitrogen at a rate of 1.5 L/min. Control animals were exposed
to ambient air. After 2 h, the mice were returned to normal atmospheric
conditions. At 48 h after PC, the mice were subjected to pMCAO
and the differences in infarct volumes between the groups were determined
at 24 h after pMCAO by TTC staining as described above. To
determine the effect of A420983 on PC protection against brain infarction
, mice were orally administered with vehicle or 18 mg/kg A420983
immediately after PC and every 12 h thereafter for 48 h before pMCAO.
Statistics.We calculated the means and SEM for all treatment groups.
The data were subjected to Student’s t test to determine the significant
differences between treatment groups. Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS software. In all cases, a p value of 0.05 was considered

Results
Lck mediates preconditioning in NMDA-induced
neuronal death
Only cultures which were	90% positive for neuronal specific
markers were used. NMDA-induced delayed cytotoxicity in primary
cortical neurons has been used as anin vitromodel of ischemic
neuronal cell death (Manzerra et al., 2001; Tauskela et al.,
2003; Lin et al., 2008). NMDA-induced
(10–100M) cytotoxicity was observed in
a dose-dependent manner. Confirming
previous reports, cells that were preconditioned
by preexposure to sublethal
NMDA (10M) exhibited decreased vulnerability
to subsequent exposure to lethal
concentrations of NMDA (50 M)
(Fig. 1A,B).
We then examined the effect of decreasing
Lck protein on PC using siRNA
against Lck and mutant mice deficient for
the Lck gene. Lck gene silencing using
siRNA abolished PC (Fig. 1C,D), suggesting
that Lck plays a critical role in neuronal
PC. Silencing efficiency was
confirmed by demonstrating both decreased
Lck protein and mRNA levels
(Fig. 1E,F). Similarly, although cortical
neurons isolated from Lck/ mice exhibited
a cytotoxic response to NMDA
in a similar fashion to wild-type neurons
, neurons from Lck/ mice could
not be preconditioned (Fig. 1G). Significantly
, silencing another Src kinase,
Yes, by using siRNA against Yes did not
affect PC (Fig. 1C,D,H), suggesting that
not all Src family members mediate PC.
To determine whether changes in Lck
kinase activity mediate PC, neuronal lysates
were immunoprecipitated with Lck
antibody. The total Lck amount in each
immunoprecipitatewasnotdifferent(Fig.
1I, top), but Lck kinase activity was significantly
increased by NMDA PC (Fig. 1I).
Neither the total Lck protein levels nor the
mRNA levels were affected by NMDA PC
(Fig. 1J,K), suggesting that enhanced Lck activity rather than
enhanced enzyme levels mediate PC.
Lck mediates PC in the OGD model of PC
To confirm our findings in anotherin vitromodel of PC, we used
OGD, a well established in vitro model, for ischemic neuronal
damage and PC (Stenzel-Poore et al., 2004; Wetzel et al., 2008).
Neuronal cells were preconditioned with exposure to 30 min
OGD. Confirming previous reports, preconditioned neurons exhibited
decreased vulnerability to subsequent lethal exposure to
2 h OGD (Fig. 2A). Silencing Lck using siRNA abolished OGD
PC protection (Fig. 2B), and similarly, neurons from Lck/
mice, mutant mice deficient for the Lck gene, could not be preconditioned
by OGD (Fig. 2C). Lck kinase activation but not
mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 2D) was increased after OGD PC in
a similar pattern to NMDA PC. Together, these findings suggest
that Lck mediates PC regardless of type of the preconditioning
stimuli.
Lck mediates PC in focal cerebral ischemia
Next, we sought to determine the role of Lck in PC in vivo
using the mouse pMCAO model. PC (exposure to 8% oxygen
for 2 h) of mice followed by pMCAO at 48 h after PC significantly
reduced the infarct volume compared with the control
group, as measured by TTC staining at 24 h after MCAO (Fig.
3A). To determine whether Lck influences in vivo PC neuro-

at 37°C for OGD. OGD PC (30 min) reduced lethal OGD (2 h)-induced neuronal
cytotoxicity in PI-staining. OGD PC was performed 24 h before lethal OGD stimulation. Cytotoxicity was examined at 24 h
after lethal OGD stimulation.B, Silencing Lck significantly reversed OGD PC neuroprotection. siRNAs were transfected 48 h

protection, we used Lck/mice and an
orally active Lck antagonist, A420983
(Waegell et al., 2002). First, we examined
whether the vulnerability to pMCAO
is affected by Lck gene deletion
(Fig. 3B) and found no significant difference
in infarct volumes between
wild-type, Lck/ or Lck/ mice (WT
vs Lck/, p  0.319; WT vs Lck/,
p  0.229; Lck/ vs Lck/, p 
0.961). Unlike wild-type mice that demonstrated
decreased infarct volumes following
PC, Lck/ mice did not exhibit
decreased vulnerability to focal ischemia
after PC (Fig. 3C). Physiological
parameters during surgical procedure
were not different between the groups as
shown in Table 1. Similarly, mice
treated with A420983 did not exhibit
decreased infarct volumes after PC
compared with vehicle treated mice
(Fig. 3D).
Protein kinase Cregulates Lck
activation in PC neuroprotection
Previous data suggest that Lck mediates
cardioprotection through the formation
of PKC-Lck signaling module (Ping et
al., 1999, 2002). To investigate the upstream
regulators of Lck in PC in the
brain, we investigated the involvement of
PKC in the NMDA PC model. Pretreatment
with a PKC inhibitor (V1-2;10
M) abolished PC, suggesting that PC is
mediated by PKCactivation (Fig. 4A,B).
Moreover, pharmacological activation of
PKC by RACK (10 M) simulated
NMDA PC, resulting in decreased vulnerability
to lethal NMDA toxicity in cortical
neuronal cells (Fig. 4A,B).
Next, we sought to determine whether
interaction between PKCand Lck occurs
in preconditioned neurons using coimmunoprecipitation
(Ping et al., 2002). PKC was found to coreside in Lckimmunoprecipitates
, and this interaction was significantly increased
after NMDA PC (Fig. 4C). After inhibiting PKC by
V1-2, NMDA-induced Lck kinase activation during PC was
abolished (Fig. 4D), suggesting that Lck activity is regulated by
PKCactivation during PC.
Fyn is the downstream target of Lck
Published data suggest that Lck can regulate Fyn, another member
of the Src family kinases (Suzuki and Okumura-Noji, 1995;
Filipp et al., 2008; Isosaka et al., 2008). To determine whether Fyn
is the downstream target of Lck in PC, we first examined Fyn
phosphorylation and activity in NMDA PC. Immunoblotting to
Fyn phosphorylated at Tyr 417, a positive regulatory residue for its
activation (Filipp et al., 2008), revealed that p-Fyn levels are significantly
enhanced during NMDA PC (Fig. 5A). Similarly, Fyn
kinase activity from Fyn-immunoprecipitates was increased
by NMDA PC (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Fyn is activated during
PC. While inhibition of Fyn by silencing Fyn (siFyn) transfection
did not affect NMDA-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C), si-
Fyn significantly abolished PC (Fig. 5D), reflecting that Fyn
activation is critical for PC. Silencing efficiency was determined
(Fig. 5E). We also investigated the role of Fyn in PC
using OGD ischemia model, and found similar effects to
NMDA PC (Fig. 5F,G).
Next we examined changes in p-Fyn levels after silencing Lck
using siRNA or in neurons from Lck/ mice. NMDA PC-
induced Fyn phosphorylation was not increased after Lck gene
silencing with siRNA or in neurons from Lck/ mice (Fig.
5H,I), implying that Lck is the upstream regulator of Fyn activation.
While Fyn is regulated by Lck, siFyn did not affect PCFigure

Fyn axis is critical in PC.
Discussion
Our data provide new insights into the role of Lck in PC in the
brain. Usingin vitromodels of PC, we showed that enhanced Lck
kinase activity mediates PC. Neurons derived from Lck/mice
or neurons in which the Lck gene was silenced by siRNA could
not be preconditioned. We also showed that PKC, a kinase that
has been shown to be an important mediator of PC, is an upstream
activator of Lck. Significantly, we have identified Fyn as a
downstream target for Lck. Lck activation during PC leads to the
activation of Fyn and silencing Fyn abolished PC. The important
role of Lck was verified in vivo using an animal model of stroke.
Lck gene deletion or pharmacological Lck antagonism blocked
PCin vivo. Together, our data show that the PKC-Lck-Fyn signaling
axis is an important mediator of PC. We cannot, however,
exclude the possibility that Lck and/or Fyn could be activated by
other yet-to be-identified upstream signals.
We used sublethal NMDA, OGD, and hypoxia to induce tolerance
, but other models also exist (McLaughlin et al., 2003;
Hoyte et al., 2006; Dave et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2010). Whether Lck
plays a role in those preconditioning paradigms is not known.
Although we used highly purified neuronal cultures, the potential
influence of small amounts of other non-neuronal cells such as
astrocytes and microglia cannot be entirely discounted and need
further investigation. For thein vivostudies, we determined 24 h
outcomes (infarct volume). Long-term outcomes (both histological
and behavioral) remain to be determined in future studies.
Future studies will also need to explore
the relative contribution of Lck and Fyn at
various time intervals after PC, because
rapid tolerance and delayed tolerance may
be mechanistically distinct (Bright et al.,
2008; Obrenovitch, 2008).
The role of PKCin PC
Previous studies showed that PKCis an
important mediator of PC in both heart
and brain (Raval et al., 2003; Chou and
Messing, 2005; Jia et al., 2007; Bright et
al., 2008; DeFazio et al., 2009). PKC is
activated by a number of preconditioning
stimuli, including hypoxia and transient
ischemia. Downstream targets of
PKC are many and include GABA signaling
, mitochondrial function alteration
, and extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERKs) (Jia et al., 2007; Dave et
al., 2008; DeFazio et al., 2009). However
, the precise molecular targets of
PKC still remain unclear. It is unlikely
that PC involves a single obligatory mediator
, and it is likely that there is activation
of a constellation of different
pathways that ultimately leads to tolerance
(Brooks and Hearse, 1996). It is
possible that other mediators and pathways
may play a greater role depending
on the PC stimulus. Studying other PC
models will be important to better understand
this complicated endogenous
neuroprotective mechanism.
Lck—a novel mediator of PC in brain
Lck has been primarily investigated in the immune system in T
lymphocytes. Lck plays an essential role in T cell receptor (TCR)
signaling, modulating T cell activation and differentiation (Palacios
and Weiss, 2004; Salmond et al., 2009). Recent data also
suggest that Lck plays a role in mitochondrial signaling in apoptosis
(Samraj et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008). Until now, most
studies have focused on the selective inhibition of Lck for therapeuticimmunosuppressionandtreatmentofimmunologicaldiseases
, such as rheumatoid arthritis, based on its role in the
immune system (Benati and Baldari, 2008; Meyn and Smithgall,
2008). Our data show that Lck activation contributes to PC and
that inhibition of Lck abolishes PC. Whether activation of Lck
would induce neuroprotection is not known and selective Lck
activators are not available at this time. Although recent data
suggest that Unc 119 can activate Lck in T cells (Gorska et al.,
2004), it can also activate other Src kinases that would make it
difficult to tease out the precise role of Lck activation. Another
strategy worthy of further investigation may involve using PKC
activators to activate Lck.
Lck can also modulate the activity of other Src family kinase
members such as Fyn, by phosphorylation of its active site Tyr
417 (Filipp et al., 2003). Previous studies suggest that Lck and Fyn
have overlapping cellular functions and are closely related to each
other (Filipp et al., 2003, 2008). However, this has not been previously
examined in PC or in the brain. Our data show that neurons
from Lck/ mice or wild-type neurons transfected with
siRNA against Lck (siLck) exhibited significantly reduced Fyn

activation and phosphorylation induced by PC, suggesting that
Lck modulates Fyn activation in neurons. While it appears that
Lck is responsible for Fyn activation during PC, silencing Fyn did
not affect PC-induced Lck activation, suggesting that Fyn activation
is downstream of Lck.
Downstream targets of Fyn
The precise function of Fyn in the brain is not known. Fyn regulates
NMDA receptors by the phosphorylation of its subunits
(Salter and Kalia, 2004; Wu et al., 2007), which modulate NMDA
receptor channel activity (Takasu et al., 2002). Following transient
ischemia in rats, phosphorylation of the NR2A and, to a
lesser extent, NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor is increased
(Takagi et al., 1999). The association between Fyn and NR2A
following ischemia is accompanied by increased NR2A phosphorylation
(Hou et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2008). Ischemia also
enhances the association between Fyn and other proteins in the
NMDA receptor complex, such as PSD-95 and the L-type voltage
gated calcium channel (Hou et al., 2003). Administration of a
selective NR2A antagonist increased neuronal death and abolished
preconditioning, whereas administration of an NR2B
antagonist decreased neuronal death and enhanced the preconditioning
effect (Chen et al., 2008). Fyn has been implicated
in the phosphorylation and activation of both of these subunits,
therefore it is possible that Fyn activity modulates preconditioning
by influencing NR2A and NR2B activity. Another potential
downstream candidate target is carveolin, a scaffolding protein
that may also influence the activation of NMDA receptors (Head
et al., 2008). Although our laser Doppler studies did not show any
differences in blood flow between experimental groups in the in
vivo studies, we cannot, however, discount the possibility that
changes in blood flow may have occurred in the penumbra of the
infarct. The precise downstream pathways that are modulated by
Fyn activation are not known and need further investigation.
Other Src family members
Although the role of Src family kinases in neurons has been investigated
in previous studies, the individual importance of each
family member is not fully understood due to the lack of selective
inhibitors/activators. Conventional inhibitors such as PP1 and
PP2 lack selectivity (Hanke et al., 1996). To overcome this, we
used RNA silencing to inhibit specific Src family members, Lck,
Fyn, and Yes. We demonstrated that Lck and Fyn, but not Yes, are
involved in PC. It is possible that other Src kinases may also be
involved in PC and their function may not be mutually exclusive.
An important point for consideration when manipulating Src
kinases is that they may enhance angiogenesis that may facilitate
recovery after stroke (Schlessinger, 2000; Slevin et al., 2006).
Implications
A desperate need exists for new stroke therapies (Fagan, 2010).
Although PC is a powerful endogenous neuroprotective mechanism
, translation of preclinical findings into therapies still remains
a challenge (Keep et al., 2010). Our data suggest that
selective activation of Lck or Fyn may represent a novel therapeutic
strategy for stroke therapy development.
