ABSTRACT: Radiolabeled C-5-disubstituted pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones have recently been suggested by our group as a class of
potent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) targeted radiotracers that can noninvasively visualize activated MMPs by means of
positron emission tomography (PET). MMPs belong to the zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases which are involved in
the proteolytic degradation of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but also are capable of processing and releasing
bioactive molecules such as growth factors, proteinase inhibitors, and cytokines. Locally increased levels of activated MMPs
modulate and contribute to the progression of various diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, arthritis, and others.
Therefore, activated MMPs are suitable biological targets for the specific and noninvasive visualization of aforementioned
pathologies in vivo. On the basis of our recent results, we here describe a series of new fluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones of the
second generation with maintained MMP inhibition potencies (IC
50
= 4 −605 nM), which are fine-tuned toward more
hydrophilic versions, and show the improved biodistribution behavior of one selected radiofluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione by
means of small-animal PET.
■ INTRODUCTION
The visualization of locally up-regulated and activated
extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading peptidases in vivo
(such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) is a clinical
challenge. MMPs are involved in the proteolytic degradation of
ECM components but also are capable of modulating and
initiating the release of bioactive molecules such as growth
factors, proteinase inhibitors, and cytokines.1 To date, more
than 20 human MMPs have been characterized. On the basis of
their specificity, the MMPs are classified into collagenases,
gelatinases, stromelysins, and matrilysins. Another subclass of
the MMPs is represented by the membrane-type MMPs (MTMMPs
) that additionally contain a transmembrane and
intracellular domain, a membrane linker domain or are
membrane associated.2,3
MMPs are secreted as inactive zymogens (pro-MMPs). Once
activated via the “cysteine switch” mechanism, a zinc active site
is provided that initiates its proteolytic activity.4 Activated
MMPs are tightly controlled by several endogenous inhibitors,
e.g., the plasma inhibitor α
2
-macroglobulin, four tissue
inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs),5 or the plasmamembrane
anchored cell surface receptor RECK (reversioninducing-cysteine-rich
protein with kazal motifs).6
In pathophysiological processes an increased cytokine and
growth factor-stimulated MMP gene transcription, followed by
an abnormal pro-MMP secretion and zymogen activation, might
become prevalent, triggering the progression of inflammation,
cancer, or especially cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis
and arterial aneurysm.7,8
There are several groups that are currently working on the
development and evaluation of MMP inhibitor (MMPI) based
radiotracers targeting MMPs in their activated forms and on the
noninvasive imaging of MMP-associated diseases by means of
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or
positron emission tomography (PET).9−12

Recently, the pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones (or barbiturates) were
identified as potent MMPIs that exhibit specific activities by
binding to the zinc(II) active site of a subgroup of activated
MMPs comprising the gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9),
neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), and the membrane bound
MMPs MT-1-MMP (MMP-14) and MT-3-MMP (MMP-16).13
The C-5-disubstituted pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione derivative 1 (RO
28-2653) was found to exhibit a strong antitumoral and antiangiogenic
efficacy and thus is able to target tumor tissues.14
These prerequisites support the approach of using the
barbiturates as molecular MMP-targeted imaging agents.15 In
contrast to the bidentate zinc(II) binding moiety of the
radiofluorinated hydroxamate-based MMP-targeted radiotracers
recently introduced by our group,16−18 it is speculated that the
enolic tautomer of the pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones either binds in
an almost tridentate manner to the zinc active site19 or chelates
in a monodentate pattern via a nitrogen whereupon the
flanking oxygen atoms occupy the second coordination shell.20
We lately have introduced a first radiofluorinated C-5-
disubstituted prototype MMP-targeted radiotracer, a potent
and moderately lipophilic MMPI radiotracer based on the lead
structure 1 (experimental logD of 2.15) showing one- to twodigit
nanomolar IC
50
values especially for the gelatinases (MMP-2,
IC
50
= 23 nM; MMP-9, IC
50
= 7 nM) and which is radiolabeled
with the prominent PET-compatible positron emitter 18F
(Figure 1).21
As expected, the preliminary biodistribution studies using
the quadHIDAC small-animal PET device showed that this
18F-labeled pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione does not specifically accumulate
in tissues of nondiseased wild-type mice. The
wholebody dynamic small-animal PET scan over 120 min
indicated that the tracer uptake in nontarget organs, such as the
brain, lung, heart, and muscle, was low over all time points.
There was also a notable uptake in the bladder, indicative of a
predominant renal excretion with some hepatobilliary clearance.
In the case of occurring MMP-associated diseases the
visualization of dysregulated MMP activity in possible target
tissues such as brain, heart, lung, and tumors might be feasible.
However, the clearance of any 18F-labeled radiotracer candidate
from a living subject should correspond with or be less than the
physical half-life of the applied PET radionuclide (18F, T
1/2
=
109.7 min), and thus, an excretion behavior of the radiotracer is
desired that is more rapid compared with the 18F-labeled
prototype pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione to finally obtain high signal-tonoise
ratios of detected target tissues within a shorter time frame.
We here present a series of new fluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-
triones, fine-tuned with mini-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
1,2,3-triazole building blocks in combination with known
(radio)fluorinated prosthetic groups. As a result, a set of new
MMPIs with very high MMP inhibition potencies covering a
wide range of lipophilicities were synthesized. Hereupon we
identified a radiofluorinated, more hydrophilic pyrimidine-
2,4,6-trione of the second generation and discovered, by means
of small-animal PET imaging, its significantly accelerated in
vivo excretion characteristics compared with the radiofluorinated
MMP-targeted radiotracer of the first generation.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemistry. The pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione 1 was chosen as
lead compound, and modifications were made in the piperazinyl
moiety with the aim to improve the clearance characteristics and
to enable 18F-labeling while retaining MMP inhibition potencies
of the resulting derivatives. This approach involves the introduction
of short PEG chains, which are known to increase the
hydrophilicity and the water solubility, directing the tracer to a
predominant renal excretion route. Compared to a non-PEGylated
derivative the mini-PEG tracer should therefore lead to a higher
tracer-related signal-to-noise-ratio in the target tissue.22−24 In
addition we recently observed that by introduction of mini-PEG
units as linkers at the piperazinyl moiety, the MMP inhibition
potencies of modified barbiturate derivatives are maintained.21,25
The preparation of the key intermediates 8−12 is
summarized in Scheme 1. Pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones 9, 11, and 
12 were synthesized from the corresponding piperazines as
previously reported by our group.21,25 According to this
procedure, the alkyne derivative 8 was prepared by reaction of
5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione 326 with propargylamine.
Similarly, the piperazine 5 yielded the alkyne derivative
10 with an elongated PEG chain. To obtain the piperazine
derivative 5 from tetraethylene glycol (TEG) (Scheme 2), a
“Williamson type” coupling reaction27 using potassium tertbutoxide
(t-BuOK) in tert-butanol (t-BuOH) was applied
affording the PEG
8
derivative 16 in 83% yield.
Next, a variety of fluorinated building blocks were incorporated
into the pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione structure to give access to products
with a wide range of lipophilicities and to fathom the tolerance to
heterocycles in this position, in particular to 1,2,3-triazoles and
fluoropyridinyl substituents. The lipophilic MMPI structures 13
and 14 were obtained as outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 14 was
prepared in 78% yield via coupling with N-succinimidyl-4-fluorobenzoate28 in the presence of triethylamine.
A set of more hydrophilic pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones were achieved
from alkyne- and azido-substituted intermediates 8−11 by employing
copper(I) catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions.29 The fluorinated
triazoles 28−36 were prepared in yields of 27−72%
using copper(II) sulfate and sodium ascorbate in dimethylformamide
(DMF) (Scheme 3). With an addition of the Cu(I)-
stabilizing tris(benzyltriazolyl)methylamine ligand (TBTA), no
improvement of reaction yields was observed.
These reaction pathways provided a novel series of pyrimidine-2
,4,6-triones including nonradioactive reference compounds 13, 14, and 28−36 of potential 18F-fluorinated radioligands
as well as precursors 8−12 applicable for 18F-labeling in
two steps using the corresponding radiofluorinated prosthetic
groups, e.g., N-succinimidyl-4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB)
for amino precursor 12, 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide for alkyne
precursors 9 and 10, and 2-[18F]fluoro-3-(hex-5-ynyloxy)-
pyridine ([18F]FPy5yne) for azide precursor 11.

activated MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13 were measured by fluorogenic
in vitro inhibition assays following the procedure previously
described.30 The assays were validated using the nonradioactive
versions of the MMP inhibitors. IC
50
values were obtained from
nonlinear regression analysis of the concentration-dependent
reaction rates.
As displayed in Table 1, the target compounds revealed, similar
to the previously reported (radio)ligand 2, MMP inhibition
potencies in the nanomolar range (IC
50
of 4−605 nM). These
results clearly demonstrate a wide tolerance to modifications at
the piperazinyl moiety, which orients into the S
2
′ subsite of
the activated MMP. The modifications include insertion of
1,2,3-triazoles and fluoropyridinyl substituents. Moreover, as a
new finding, replacement of the piperazinyl moiety gave
MMPIs 28 and 29 with inhibition potencies comparable to
those of derivatives comprising this group. We have selected
compounds 28 and 29, avoiding the piperazinyl approach but
mimicking the nitrogen−nitrogen distance given in the
piperazinyl moiety.
Because of the fact that the hydrophilicity of a radioligand
has a significant impact on the biodistribution characteristics of
any radiotracer, an evaluation of the hydrophilic properties of
the target compounds is required. Therefore, the corresponding
calculated logD values (clogD) were tabulated along with the
inhibition potencies (Table 1). The obtained new generation of
pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones shows clogD values ranging from
−0.45 (MMPI 31) to 4.27 (MMPI 13). The differing logD
values display the influence of the incorporation of structural
features such as PEG units and 1,2,3-triazoles in combination
with fluorinated building blocks.
Additionally, the partition coefficient (logD) of the radiofluorinated
analog [18F]30 (see section Radiochemistry) was
determined experimentally (logD (exp) = 0.78 ± 0.02). The
experimental logD is comparable to the calculated value (clogD
(30) = 0.99). The pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione 30 is therefore
approximately 100 times more hydrophilic than the first
generation radioligand 2. The desired increased hydrophilicity
of pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione 30 is indeed realized while maintaining
its in vitro MMP inhibition characteristics, as shown by the
double-digit nanomolar IC
50
values. This encouraged us to further
improve the radiosynthesis of the 18F-labeled isotopolog [18F]30,
as follows, aiming at initial in vivo experiments using this new
MMPI radiotracer.
Radiochemistry. The 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide-conjugated
pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione [18F]30 was achieved by a semiautomated
two-step procedure consisting of the nucleophilic
radiofluorination of 2-azidoethyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate31
and subsequent copper(I) catalyzed cycloaddition with the
alkyne precursor 9 (Scheme 4). The radiosynthesis of click
chemistry building block 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide ([18F]24) was
carried out according to a procedure previously described by
Glaser and Årstad.32 [18F]24 could be isolated by distillation in
68 ± 8% radiochemical yields (decay corrected, n = 6). The
click labeling was performed outside the automated synthesizer.
Investigations of the impact of reaction time, temperature, and
the catalytic system on the radiochemical yield of [18F]30
revealed the optimal conditions to be 8 min of reaction time at
room temperature in the presence of 2 equiv of copper sulfate
relative to the alkyne precursor 9. This successfully provided
the 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole [18F]30 in radiochemical

yields of 63 ± 10% (decay-corrected, n = 6). After purification
by semipreparative HPLC, concentration by rotary evaporation,
and formulation, the two-step radiosynthesis of [18F]30 was
accomplished with an overall radiochemical yield of 43 ±
9% (decay corrected, n = 6) in 140 min from the end of
radionuclide production. The radiochemical purity of [18F]30
was >97%, and the determined specific activities were 11−20

formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to determine
logD

values and to study its in vitro stability in human serum

In Vitro Stability. An in vitro stability study was carried
out using human serum. During long-term incubation for up

In Vivo Biodistribution Study. Biodistribution characteristics
of radiotracer [18F]30 were studied in adult Balb/c mice.
Dynamic PET scans, co-registered to computed tomography
(CT), were performed throughout the studies and reconstructed
into a series of images reflecting the radiotracer
distribution at different time frames after injection of [18F]30
(Figure 3).
A similar pharmacokinetic behavior was observed compared
to radioligand 2 which has been described earlier by our
group.21 The tracer uptake in nontarget organs, such as brain,
heart, and lung, was low over all time points. Furthermore, low
accumulation of [18F]30 in the skeleton suggests that the extent
of tracer defluorination and generation of free [18F]fluoride was
negligible. [18F]30 is notably excreted via the kidneys and the
liver as indicated by the tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder
and the gallbladder/intestine, respectively. For tissues involved
in metabolic and excretory processes (liver, gallbladder, intestine,
kidney, bladder) and for potential regions for diagnostic MMPPET
, CT-guided volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined and
time−activity curves were determined (Figure 4).
Initially, a high level of radioactivity is observed in the liver
which decreases to background level in 10−15 min pi. In
comparison, model tracer 2 features a much slower clearance
from the liver in 90−120 min pi. Furthermore, by comparison
of the renal elimination of model tracer 2 with the more
hydrophilic radioligand [18F]30, the latter presents a faster
clearance from the kidneys. Hence, alteration of the chemical
structure by introducing a mini-PEG and a triazole unit led to a
favorable pharmacokinetic behavior for in vivo PET-imaging.
■ CONCLUSION
Extending our recent work on the development of MMP-
targeted radioligands, we herein present the synthesis and in
vitro characterization of a new series of fluorinated pyrimidine-
2,4,6-trione-based MMPIs derived from lead structure 1. All
compounds were evaluated as potent inhibitors of MMP-2, -8,
-9, and -13 with calculated logD values ranging from −0.45 to
4.27. This allows a systematic investigation of the effect of
hydrophilicity on biodistribution patterns of respective radiofluorinated
PET tracers together with the exploration of their in
vivo stability. One promising MMPI, [18F]30, with an increased
hydrophilicity compared to model tracer 2 described earlier by our
group,21 was successfully radiolabeled with good radiochemical
yields of 43 ± 9%. This radiofluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione
[18F]30 of the new generation revealed an excellent serum

stability in vitro and more rapid clearance characteristics, as
shown by in vivo biodistribution studies in wild type mice.
Thus, [18F]30 represents a promising MMP-targeted radiotracer
for the noninvasive PET imaging of activated MMPs in vivo,
which is putatively more favorable compared to compound 2
with respect to the physical half-life of the PET-radionuclide 18F.
In the next step preclinical PET/CT studies in disease models
with known MMP up-regulation (e.g., tumor, Lewis lung
carcinoma bearing mice; atherosclerotic plaques, apolipoprotein
E-deficient mice) will be assessed.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
General. All chemicals, reagents, and solvents were analytical
grade, purchased from commercial suppliers, and used without further
purification unless otherwise specified. Melting points were measured
on a Stuart Scientific SMP3 capillary melting point apparatus and are
uncorrected. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR spectra were
recorded in CDCl
3
or in DMSO-d
6
on Bruker AV400, Bruker AV300,
or Varian Unity plus 600 spectrometer with the corresponding solvent
signals as an internal standard. For 19F NMR shift values, CFCl
3
was
the internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm). Exact
mass analyses were conducted on a Bruker MicroTof apparatus.
Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC,
performed on silica gel coated polyester backed TLC plates, SIL
G/UV
254
, Macherey-Nagel) using solvent mixtures of cyclohexane
(CH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH), and triethylamine
(TEA). The ≥95% purities of each new nonradioactive compound
were assessed by elementary analysis or analytical reversed phase
HPLC on HPLC system I: two Smartline 1000 pumps and a Smartline
UV detector 2500 (Knauer), a GabiStar γ-detector (Raytest Isotopenmessgera
̈
te GmbH), and a Nucleosil Eurosphere 100-5 C-18
column (250 mm × 4.6 mm). The recorded data were processed by
the GINA Star software (Raytest Isotopenmessgera
̈
te GmbH). The
HPLC system I started with a linear gradient from 10% to 90%

TRACERLab Fx software (GE Healthcare). Separation and purification
of the radiosynthesized compounds were performed on the
following semipreparative radio-HPLC system: two K-1800 pumps
and S-2500 UV detector (Knauer), GabiStar γ-detector (Raytest
Isotopenmessgera
̈
te GmbH) and an ACE-126-2510 column (250 mm ×
10 mm). The recorded data were processed by the ChromGate HPLC
software (Knauer). Radiochemical purities and specific activities were
determined using an analytical radio-HPLC system composed of a
Syknm S1021 pump, a Knauer K-2501 UV detector, a Crismatec
NaI(TI) Scintibloc 51 SP51 γ-detector, a RP-HPLC Nucleosil 100-3
C-18 column (250 mm × 3 mm), and the GINA Star software
(Raytest Isotopenmessgera
̈
te GmbH). No-carrier-added aqueous
[18F]fluoride was produced on a RDS 111e cyclotron (CTI-Siemens)
by irradiation of a 1.2 mL water target using 10 MeV proton beams on
97.0% enriched [18O]water by the 18O(p,n)18F nuclear reaction. To
recover the 18O-water, the batch of aqueous [18F]fluoride was passed
through an anion exchange resin (Sep-Pak Light Waters Accell Plus
QMA cartridge, preconditioned with 5 mL of 1 M K
2
CO
3
and 10 mL
of water).
5-(4-{2-[2-(2-{2-[1-(2-[18F]Fluoroethyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-
ylmethoxy]ethoxy}ethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}piperazin-1-yl)-5-(4-
phenoxyphenyl)pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione ([18F]30). No-carrieradded
[18F]fluoride (5.3−10.2 GBq) was eluted from a QMA-cartridge
with a solution of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (18 mg) and K
2
CO
3
(40 μL, 1 M) in
acetonitrile/water (8:2, 1 mL). The aqueous solution was evaporated to
dryness in vacuo. According to the procedure described by Glaser and
Årstad,32 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide was prepared by addition of 2-
azidoethyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate31 (6 μL, 30 μmol) in anhydrous
acetonitrile (0.3 mL) to the carefully dried [18F]fluoride (potassium 222
cryptate) residue and subsequent reaction occurred at 84 °Cfor15min.
After addition of acetonitrile (0.2 mL), 2-[18F]fluoroethylazide was
distilled at 120 °C under a flow of helium into a 5 mL flask containing
DMF (0.5 mL) and cooled to 0 °C. The radiolabeling agent was
collected with a radiochemical yield of 68 ± 8% (mean ± SD, decay
corrected, n = 6). A solution of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (60 μL,
0.4 M), a solution of sodium ascorbate (50 μL, 0.6 M), water (600 μL),
and a solution of 9 (7 mg, 12 μmol) in DMF (100 μL) were added. After
8 min at room temperature, the mixture was passed through a Waters
Sep-Pak Light C18 cartridge filled with quartz wool. The cartridge was
rinsed with DMF (0.3 mL), and the resulting mixture was evaporated to
dryness in vacuo, followed by dissolving in acetonitrile/water (3:7, 1 mL,
0.1% TFA). An amount of 200 μL was fractionized by semipreparative
radio-HPLC (conditions: λ = 254 nm; flow = 5.5 mL·min−1; 33% 
CH
3
CN in water (0.1% TFA) over 25 min). The product fraction of
compound [18F]30 was evaporated to dryness in vacuo and formulated
in saline/ethanol (10:1, 0.5 mL) for further experimental use. The
radioligand [18F]30 was obtained in an overall radiochemical yield of
43 ± 9% (mean ± SD, decay-corrected, n = 6) in 140 min from end of
radionuclide production. Radiochemical purities (>97%, t
R
= 18.0 min)
and specific radioactivities (11−20 GBq·μmol−1) were determined by 
analytical radio-HPLC (conditions: λ = 254 nm; flow = 0.3 mL·min−1;
33% CH
3
CN in water (0.1% TFA)).
In Vitro Enzyme Inhibition Assays (Table 1). The inhibition
potencies of barbituric acid derivatives 13, 14, and 28−36 against
activated MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13 were assayed using the synthetic
fluorgenic substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-
Leu-(3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)Ala-Arg-NH
2
(R&D Systems) as described previously.30 In short, MMP-2, -8, -9,
or -13 (each at 2 nM) and test compounds at varying concentrations
(10 pM to 1 mM) in Tris-HCl (50 mM), pH 7.5, containing NaCl
(0.2 M), CaCl
2
(5 mM), ZnSO
4
(20 μM), and 0.05% Brij 35 were
preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. An aliquot of substrate (10 μLofa
50 μM solution) was added to the enzyme−inhibitor mixture (90 μL),
and the fluorescence changes were monitored using a Fusion universal
microplate analyzer (Packard Bioscience) with excitation and emission
wavelength of 330 and 390 nm, respectively. Reaction rates were
measured from the initial 10 min and plotted as a function of inhibitor
concentration. From the resulting inhibition curves, the IC
50
values
were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the Grace 5.1.8
software (Linux).
Determination of Partition Coefficient (logD
7.4
). The lipophilicity
of radioligand [18F]30 was assessed by determination of the
water−octanol partition coefficient following a published procedure.37
In brief, approximately 20 kBq [18F]30 was mixed with equal amounts
(0.5 mL) of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1-octanol and the resulting biphasic
system was mixed vigorously for 1 min at room temperature. The
tubes were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 2 min), and three samples of 100 μL
of each layer were counted in a γ counter (Wallac Wizard, Perkin-
Elmer Life Sciences). The partition coefficient was determined by
calculating the ratio cpm(octanol)/cpm(PBS) and expressed as log
D
7.4
(log(cpm
octanol
/cpm
PBS
)). Two independent experiments were
performed in triplicate, and data were provided as mean values ±
standard deviation.
Stability in Human Serum. The serum stability of radioligand
[18F]30 was evaluated by incubation in human serum at 37 °C for up
to 120 min. An aliquot of the PBS-formulated 18F-labeled compound
(20 μL, 5 MBq) was added to a sample of human serum (200 μL), and

In Vivo PET Studies. PET experiments were carried out using the
high resolution (0.7 mm full width at half-maximum) quadHIDAC
small-animal PET scanner (Oxford Positron Systems, Weston-on-the-
Green, U.K.).38 Balb/c mice (19−27 g) were anesthetized with
isoflurane (1.5%/0.3 L min−1) and placed on a heating pad to maintain
body temperature for insertion of tail vein catheters (26G, BD
VasculonPlus). The radiotracer [18F]30 (5−8 MBq in 100 μL, 150 μL
saline flush) was injected 30 s after the start of acquisition. List-mode
data were acquired for 60 min and reconstructed into dynamic time
frames using an iterative resolution recovery reconstruction algorithm.
Subsequently, the scanning bed was transferred to the CT scanner
(Inveon, Siemens Medical Solutions, U.S.) and a CT acquisition with a
spatial resolution of 80 μm was performed for each mouse.
Reconstructed image data sets were co-registered based on extrinsic
markers attached to the multimodal scanning bed and the image
analysis software (Inveon Research Workplace 3.0, Siemens Medical
Solutions, U.S.). Three-dimensional VOIs were defined over the
respective organs in CT data sets, transferred to the co-registered PET
data and analyzed quantitatively. Regional uptake was calculated as
percentage of injected dose by dividing counts per milliliter in the VOI
by total counts in the mouse multiplied by 100 (% ID/mL).
