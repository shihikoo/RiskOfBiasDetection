Sweet JG, Chan SL, Cipolla MJ. Effect of hypertension and
carotid occlusion on brain parenchymal arteriole structure and reactivity. J Appl Physiol 119: 817–823, 2015. First published August 20,
2015; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00467.2015.—We studied the effect
of hypertension and chronic hypoperfusion on brain parenchymal
arteriole (PA) structure and function. PAs were studied isolated
and pressurized from 18-wk-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY18; n 8) and
spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone (SHRSP18; n  8) and
5-wk-old prehypertensive (SHRSP5; n 8) rats. In separate groups,
unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAo) was performed
for 4 wk to cause chronic hypoperfusion in 18-wk-old WKY
(WKY18-CH; n 8) and SHRSP (SHRSP18-CH; n 8). UCCAo
caused PAs to have significantly diminished myogenic tone (31 3
vs. 14 6% at 60 mmHg; P 0.05) and reactivity to pressure from
WKY18-CH vs. WKY18 animals. The effect of UCCAo was limited
to normotensive animals, as there was little effect of chronic hypoperfusion
on vascular reactivity or percent tone in PAs from
SHRSP18 vs. SHRSP18-CH animals (534 vs. 413%;P0.05).
However, PAs from SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 animals had significantly
greater tone compared with WKY18, suggesting an effect of strain
and not hypertension per se on PA vasoconstriction. Structurally, PAs
from SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 animals had similar sized lumen diameters
, but increased wall thickness and distensibility compared with
WKY18. Interestingly, chronic hypoperfusion did not affect the structure
of PAs from either WKY18-CH or SHRSP18-CH animals. Thus
PAs responded to UCCAo with active vasodilation, but not structural
remodeling, an effect that was absent in SHRSP. The increased tone
of PAs from SHRSP animals, combined with lack of response to
chronic hypoperfusion, may contribute to the propensity for ischemic
lesions and increased perfusion deficit during hypertension.

OCCLUSIVE CEREBRAL ARTERIAL disease and chronic hypoperfusion
of the brain are common in adults with large and small
vessel disease (SVD) that is associated with increased risk of
stroke and cognitive impairment (1, 9, 33, 38). Several animal
models have been developed to study chronic hypoperfusion of
the brain that involves occlusion or stenosis of one or more
carotid and/or vertebral arteries in normotensive animals (2, 4,
14, 32). Depending on the model used, various pathologies
have been identified that may be relevant to human disease,
including white matter lesions, blood-brain barrier permeability
, neuroinflammation, and accelerated cognitive impairment
(2, 4, 14, 32). These models have also shown that the cerebral
vessels undergo an adaptive response to chronic hypoperfusion
involving enlargement of collateral vessels (arteriogenesis) that
can restore cerebral blood flow (CBF) to normal over a period
of weeks (2, 14, 32). Arteriogenesis of primary and secondary
collaterals in response to chronic hypoperfusion is thought to
be protective of ischemic injury by enhancing CBF reserve and
has been considered as a therapeutic intervention (21, 37).
Indeed, enlargement of collaterals due to arteriogenesis after
chronic hypoperfusion was shown to decrease infarct size in
response to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (21, 37).
The process of arteriogenesis in response to chronic hypoperfusion
occurs in collaterals through increased shear stress
that triggers a cascade of events involving endothelial cell
activation, recruitment of monocytes and polymorphonuclear
cells, and release of various cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors, leading to vessel enlargement (3, 29). Arteriogenesis
during chronic hypoperfusion is well-characterized in
collaterals, where changes in shear stress are pronounced (30).
However, how chronic hypoperfusion affects other segments
of the cerebrovasculature that are not collaterals and thus do
not experience large changes in shear stress, is less understood.
In MCAs, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo)
for 15 days caused modest structural remodeling that included
hypotrophy of the vessel wall and diminished myogenic tone
without a change in passive lumen diameter (22), suggesting
adaptive responses to chronic hypoperfusion occur in large,
noncollateral cerebral arteries as well.
Blood supply to the brain parenchyma is via penetrating and
parenchymal arterioles (PAs) that branch off pial vessels at
right angles and directly connect the pial surface vessels to the
capillary bed (5). PAs are high-resistance vessels due to their
long and relatively unbranched architecture with few anastomoses
(5, 15). PAs have recently been shown to be the major
site of autoregulatory vasodilation during unilateral common
carotid artery occlusion (UCCAo) that maintains CBF during
decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (36). Importantly, structural
and functional changes in PAs are key features of ischemic
cerebral SVD that undergo remodeling of the arteriolar
wall and reduced lumen diameter, loss of autoregulation, and
locally increased blood-brain barrier permeability that is
thought to underlie white matter lesions and cognitive impairment
(13, 27). SVD is also associated with chronic cerebral
hypoperfusion that is pronounced in patients with carotid
stenosis, aging, and hypertension (10, 38, 39). In fact, hypertension
is considered a main risk factor for SVD, yet only a few
studies have investigated the effect of chronic hypoperfusion
on arteriogenesis in models of hypertension, and even fewer
have studied PAs under these conditions. Jalal et al. (20) used
spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone (SHRSP) rats combined
with chronic hypoperfusion, and reported that BCCAo is
lethal in these animals. In addition UCCAo in SHRSP causes
white matter damage in both hemispheres, suggesting intolerance
to chronic hypoperfusion during hypertension (20).

Further, studies have shown arteriogenesis of both primary
(circle of Willis vessels) and secondary (leptomeningeal anastomoses
) collaterals in response to chronic hypoperfusion is
impaired during hypertension (26, 34). However, the effect of
chronic hypoperfusion on PAs in the setting of hypertension is
less understood, but potentially important to understand, given
the central role these vessels have in SVD.
In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic
hypoperfusion on PAs under normotensive and hypertensive
conditions and measured changes in structural remodeling,
vasoreactivity, and endothelial function. We hypothesized that
chronic hypoperfusion causes adaptive changes in PAs to
increase lumen diameter (outward remodeling and decreased
tone) that is prevented during hypertension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. Experiments were performed using female Wistar-Kyoto
(WKY) and SHRSP rats (Charles River) at age 5 or 18 wk. All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Vermont and complied with the
National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory
animals. Rats were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University
of Vermont, an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care-accredited facility. Rats were maintained on a
12:12-h light-dark cycle and allowed food and water ad libitum.
Animals (n  8/group) were grouped as naive 5-wk-old SHRSP
(SHRSP5), naive 18-wk-old SHRSP (SHRSP18), naive 18-wk-old
WKY (WKY18), or 18-wk-old WKY (WKY18-CH) or SHRSP
(SHRSP18-CH) with 4-wk chronic UCCAo.
Animal model of chronic UCCAo. Chronic UCCAo was surgically
induced at 14 wk of age and maintained for 4 wk until experimentation
at 18 wk old in WKY and SHRSP animals. Animals were
anesthetized by inhaled isoflurane (1.5-2%) in oxygen and air. A
midline neck incision was placed, and the right common carotid artery
and external carotid artery were exposed. The common carotid artery
was permanently ligated with two 4-0 sterile silk sutures proximal to
the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid arteries. Following
surgery, animals received buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously
near the incision site for pain.
Blood pressure measurements. Blood pressures were measured
noninvasively at 5 or 18 wk old by determining the tail blood volume
with a volume pressure recording sensor and an occlusion tail cuff
(Coda 8 system, Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT), as described previously
(6). Briefly, animals were placed in individual holders, and
both an occlusion cuff and a volume pressure recording sensor cuff
were placed near the base of the tail. Volume pressure recording
allowed the simultaneous measurement of six blood pressure parameters
: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood
pressure, heart pulse rate, tail blood volume, and tail blood flow.
Preparation of isolated PAs and pressurized arteriograph. Animals
were quickly decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia, and the
brain was removed and placed in cold, oxygenated physiological
saline solution (PSS). PAs branching perpendicularly from the M1
and M2 regions of the right MCA and penetrating into the brain
parenchyma were carefully dissected and mounted onto glass cannulas
in an arteriograph chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation,
Burlington, VT), as previously described (7). In animals that underwent
UCCAo, PAs were taken from the side of occlusion.
Isolated arteriole myogenic tone, reactivity, and structural
measurements. PAs were dissected and mounted in an arteriograph
chamber, pressurized to 20 mmHg, and equilibrated for1htoallow
spontaneous development of myogenic tone. After the equilibration
period, myogenic reactivity was assessed with stepwise increases in
intravascular pressure up to 100 mmHg and recording lumen diameter
once stable. Intravascular pressure was returned to 40 mmHg for the
remainder of the experiment. NS309, a small- and intermediateconductance
calcium-activated K channel (SK/IK) agonist, was
cumulatively added to the bath (108-105 M), and diameter measured
at each dose. NS309 was washed out of the bath, and PAs were
allowed to regain myogenic tone. A single dose ofN-nitro-L-arginine
(L-NNA, 0.1 mM), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, was added
to the bath and diameter measured once stable. Sodium nitroprusside
(SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, was cumulatively added to the bath
(108-105 M) in the presence of L-NNA, and diameter measured at
each concentration. At the conclusion of the experiment, PAs were
superfused with papaverine (0.1 mM) and diltiazem (10 	M) in
calcium-free PSS to obtain fully passive diameter and structural
measurements.
Drugs and solutions. All isolated vessel experiments were performed
using a bicarbonate-based Ringer’s PSS, the ionic composition
of which was as follows (in mmol/l): NaCl 119.0, NaHCO

1.6, EDTA
0.026, and glucose 5.5. PSS was made each week and stored without
glucose at 4°C. Glucose was added to the PSS before each experiment.
PSS was aerated with 5% CO
2
, 10% O
2
, and 85% N
2
to
maintain pH. Diltiazem was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Santa
Ana, CA) and made up weekly to a 1 mM stock. Papaverine and
L-NNA were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and made
weekly to 10 mM stocks. NS309 and SNP were purchased from
Sigma, and aliquots of 10 mM stocks were frozen at20°C until use.
Data calculations and statistical analysis. Results are presented as
means SE. Myogenic tone was calculated as a percent decrease in
diameter from the fully relaxed diameter in calcium-free PSS with
diltiazem and papaverine by the following equation: [1  (
tone
/

passive
)]
 100%, where
tone
is the inner diameter of the vessel with
tone, and
passive
is the inner diameter of the vessel in calcium-free
PSS with diltiazem and papaverine. Percent constriction to L-NNA
was calculated as a percent change in diameter from baseline by the
following equation: [1 (
drug
/
baseline
)]
 100%, where
drug
is the
diameter of vessel in L-NNA, and 
baseline
is the diameter before
giving drug. Percent reactivity to SNP and NS309 was calculated from
the following equation: [(
dose

baseline
)/(
passive

baseline
)] 

100%, where
dose
is the diameter at a specific concentration of drug.
Percent distensibility was calculated for fully relaxed vessels in
calcium-free PSS with diltiazem and papaverine at each pressure by
the following equation: (
pressure

5mmHg
)/(
5mmHg
) 
 100%,
where 
pressure
is the passive diameter at a specific pressure, and

5mmHg
is defined as the passive diameter at the lowest pressure (5
mmHg). Outer diameter (OD) was calculated using the equation ID
2WT, where ID is the measured inner diameter, and WT is the
measured wall thickness. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated
as(OD/2)2 (ID/2)2.
Differences in blood pressure, active diameters, percent tone,
percent constriction, percent reactivity, percent distensibility, and
passive structural measurements were determined by one-way
ANOVA with a post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple
comparisons. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effect of
hypertension or UCCAo treatment and their interaction on passive
structural characteristics. Differences were considered significant at
P 0.05.
RESULTS
Effect of hypertension on PA myogenic reactivity and tone.
To determine the influence of hypertension on PAs, we used
SHRSP animals that were 18 wk old compared with agematched
normotensive WKY and prehypertensive 5 wk old
SHRSP in an attempt to distinguish strain differences. Physiological
parameters of WKY18, SHRSP18, and SHRSP5 animals
are shown in Table 1. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood
pressures were significantly higher in SHRSP18 compared

with WKY18. Blood pressures of SHRSP5 were significantly
lower than those of SHRSP18 and similar to those of WKY18,
confirming the prehypertensive state of these animals. The
body weight of SHRSP5 was lower than that of all other
groups, as expected.
PAs from SHRSP18 had significantly smaller active inner
diameters at all pressures studied compared with WKY18
(Fig. 1A). Active inner diameters of PAs from normotensive
SHRSP5 were not different from those of SHRSP18 and
significantly smaller vs. WKY18. The smaller active diameter
of PAs from both SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 groups was at least
partially due to increased pressure-induced tone in those vessels
(Fig. 1B). Thus increased myogenic tone and smaller inner
diameters of PAs were associated with the SHRSP strain and
not hypertension per se. In addition, inner diameters of PAs
from WKY18, SHRSP18, and SHRSP5 did not change appreciably
with increasing pressure, demonstrating those vessels
had myogenic reactivity.
Effect of chronic hypoperfusion on PA myogenic reactivity
and tone. Chronic hypoperfusion by UCCAo for 4 wk decreased
myogenic reactivity in PAs from WKY18-CH, such
that diameters increased with increasing intravascular pressure
(Fig. 1A). In fact, the slope of the diameter vs. pressure curves was
minimal in WKY18, SHRSP18, SHRSP18-CH, and SHRSP5
(0.02 0.02, 0.01 0.02, 0.03 0.02, and 0.04 0.04), but
was significantly increased and positive in WKY18-CH (0.18
0.05;P0.01 vs. all). In addition, they had significantly larger
active diameters at all pressures studied compared with all
other groups. PAs from WKY18-CH also had significantly less
myogenic tone at 60 mmHg vs. all groups (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, SHRSP18-CH had considerably less effect on PAs.
Although PAs from SHRSP18-CH animals had inner diameters
that were larger than those of SHRSP18, there was no statistical
difference between these groups. Similarly, the percentage
of tone was less in PAs from SHRSP18-CH compared with
SHRSP18, but this was not statistically different. UCCAo was
not performed on 5-wk-old SHRSP.
Effect of hypertension on PA reactivity to NO and SK/IK
channel activation. Figure 2A shows the percent constriction to
L-NNA in PAs from all groups. All vessels constricted to NOS
inhibition with L-NNA, demonstrating PAs have basal NO that
inhibits tone in these vessels. The percent constriction was not
different between WKY18 and SHRSP18; however, it was
significantly decreased in PAs from SHRSP5. Figure 2B shows
the reactivity to the NO donor SNP in PAs from all groups.
Dilation to SNP was significantly increased in SHRSP18 compared
with WKY18 and SHRSP5, demonstrating an effect of
hypertension on sensitivity to SNP, but not strain. Figure 3
shows percent reactivity to the SK/IK channel opener NS309.
All vessels dilated significantly to NS309, and there was no
difference in reactivity between SHRSP5 and SHRSP18; however
, PAs from WKY18 animals were modestly more sensitive
to SK/IK channel activation that was significant at 0.3	M.
Effect of chronic hypoperfusion on PA reactivity to NO and
SK/IK activation. Chronic hypoperfusion decreased constriction
to L-NNA in PAs from WKY18 (WKY-CH) but not
SHRSP (SHRSP-CH) (Fig. 2A). The constriction to L-NNA in
PAs from SHRSP18-CH was unaffected by chronic hypoper-

PAs were taken from the ipsilateral side to occlusion. Both SHRSP5 and SHRSP18 animals had PAs with smaller lumen diameters compared with WKY18 at
all pressures. These vessels displayed myogenic activity as diameter did not change with increased pressure. UCCAo caused increased diameters in PAs from
WKY18-CH animals and diminished reactivity to pressure. There was little effect of UCCAo on PAs form SHRSP18-CH animals. B: percent myogenic tone

fusion. Figure 2B shows the reactivity to SNP in PAs from all
groups except WKY18-CH. In those vessels, the decrease in
tone and substantial vasodilation did not allow for a dilatory
curve to be performed. Chronic hypoperfusion of SHRSP had
no effect on SNP dilation of PAs that was similar between
SHRSP18 and SHRSP18-CH. Figure 3 shows the dilation of
PAs to NS309. Again, dilation to NS309 was not done in
WKY18-CH because these vessels were already dilated. There
was no difference in reactivity to NS309 between SHRSP18
and SHRSP18-CH.
Effect of hypertension on PA structural remodeling. Structural
characteristics of PAs from all groups are shown in
Table 2. Structural measurements were compared at 5 and 60
mmHg to evaluate the effect of hypertension on PAs in an
unpressurized state (5 mmHg), where differences in distensibility
would not influence the diameters, and at a physiological
pressure (60 mmHg). There were no statistical differences in
inner or outer diameters at either 5 or 60 mmHg by one-way
ANOVA between WKY18, SHRSP18, and SHRSP5. However
, SHRSP5 had increased wall thickness compared with
WKY18 at 5 mmHg, whereas SHRSP18 wall thickness was
increased at 5 and 60 mmHg vs. WKY18. CSA was increased
only in SHRSP18 at 60 mmHg, but not at 5 mmHg or in
SHRSP5 vs. WKY18. Figure 4 shows the passive distensibility
of PAs from all groups. Passive distensibility was significantly
increased in both SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 compared with
WKY18, suggesting a strain difference and not hypertension
per se that affected vessel stiffness.
Effect of chronic hypoperfusion on PA structural remodeling.
Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the influence of
hypertension and chronic hypoperfusion on PA remodeling in
18-wk-old animals only. Passive inner diameters of PAs at 5
mmHg were significantly smaller from SHRSP18-CH compared
with WKY18-CH (Table 2). Similarly, wall thickness at
5 and 60 mmHg and CSA at 60 mmHg were significantly
greater in PAs from SHRSP18-CH vs. WKY18-CH. However,
despite smaller lumens and thicker walls of SHRSP18-CH
compared with WKY18-CH, chronic hypoperfusion did not
affect structural characteristics of PAs from either SHRSP or
WKY, as there were no significant differences in any parameter
between WKY18 vs. WKY18-CH or SHRSP18 vs.
SHRSP18-CH. Passive distensibility was increased in
WKY18-CH compared with WKY18, although this was not
significantly different (Fig. 4). Again, although distensibility of
PAs was increased in SHRSP18 and SHRSP18-CH compared
with WKY, there was no effect of chronic hypoperfusion on
distensibility in these vessels.
DISCUSSION
The major findings of this study were that 4 wk of UCCAo
caused substantial vasodilation in PAs from WKY18
(WKY18-CH) animals, such that there was significantly decreased
myogenic tone and reactivity to pressure. The effect of
chronic hypoperfusion was largely prevented in SHRSP18
(SHRSP18-CH) animals, suggesting hypertension impaired
this adaptive response to hypoperfusion. Interestingly, the
effect of chronic hypoperfusion in WKY animals was limited
to vasoactive responses, as there was no effect of UCCAo on
passive structural characteristics (passive diameters, wall
thickness, or distensibility) of PAs from either WKY18-CH or
SHRSP18-CH animals compared with their naive counterparts.
In addition, we found that PAs from SHRSP animals had
smaller active lumen diameters that was due to increased

myogenic tone and not structural changes in the vessel wall
(i.e., inward remodeling). Lastly, prehypertensive SHRSP5
animals had PAs with similarly increased tone as hypertensive
SHRSP18 animals, suggesting that it was the SHRSP strain
and not hypertension per se that caused this effect.
PAs from normotensive WKY rats appeared to undergo an
adaptive vasodilatory response to UCCAo. In fact, PAs from
WKY18-CH animals had little myogenic tone and responded
in a passive manner to increased intravascular pressure, suggesting
loss of myogenic reactivity. Although we attempted to
investigate underlying mechanisms by which vascular responses
might be different, including dilation to NO and SK/IK
channel activation, PAs from WKY18-CH animals were so
potently dilated we could not perform dilation curves. We
speculate that the smooth muscle from these vessels is in a
hyperpolarized state, potentially due to changes in ion channel
expression or activity, such as voltage-dependent or largeconductance
calcium-activated K channels that can promote
hyperpolarization of smooth muscle. While this vasodilatory
response may be an important adaptation during UCCAo to
preserve CBF to the brain parenchyma, the diminished reactivity
to pressure would likely cause loss of local CBF autoregulation
, one of the proposed mechanisms leading to white
matter injury during cerebral ischemic SVD (13, 27, 36).
The adaptive vasodilatory response of PAs to UCCAo that
was noted in WKY18-CH animals was not seen in
SHRSP18-CH that had similar tone and reactivity as vessels
from SHRSP18 animals. While it is not clear why PAs from
SHRSP did not respond to UCCAo in the same manner as PAs
from WKY, it is possible that there was an overall lack of
adaptation in other (upstream) vessels as well, such as the
collateral systems, and that CBF was not restored to normal in
SHRSP18-CH animals. Although we did not measure CBF in
either group of animals during the 28 days of UCCAo, studies
have shown that hypertension prevents arteriogenesis of both
circle of Willis and leptomeningeal anastomoses vessels in
response to UCCAo, suggesting this may be the case (26, 34).
In addition, Jalal et al. (20) reported that BCCAo in SHRSP
animals was lethal, further supporting the concept that arteriogenesis
of collaterals during chronic hypoperfusion is an important
protective response of the cerebral circulation to maintain
CBF that is impaired during hypertension. Although we do
not know if the level of CBF during UCCAo was reduced in
SHRSP compared with WKY, CBF has been shown to be
decreased in male SHRSP at 20 wk of age (41), which would
likely decrease further with UCCAo.
It is not entirely surprising that PAs from WKY18-CH or
SHRSP18-CH did not undergo structural enlargement. The
primary driver for arteriogenesis is increased shear stress that
occurs in collaterals when blood flow is redirected during an
occlusion (3, 29, 30). PAs are not collaterals, but end vessels
that directly connect the pial circulation to the capillaries.
Thus the stimulus for arteriogenesis may be absent in PAs,
although this was not directly measured in this study. It is worth
noting that, in studies using BCCAo, structural remodeling of
noncollateral vessels has been found (21, 22, 32). Kim et al.
(21) found that 4 wk of BCCAo caused enlargement of the
posterior cerebral and communicating arteries, as well as
increased size of parenchymal vessels on immunohistochemistry.
Márquez-Martín et al. (22) found that 15 days of BCCAo
caused decreased wall thickness and CSA, but not structural
enlargement of MCAs. However, BCCAo does not engage
collaterals to the same extent as UCCAo, and thus vascular
remodeling in noncollateral vessels may be more related to
ischemia during BCCAo than to changes in shear stress.

PAs from SHRSP18 had significantly increased tone and
smaller lumen diameters actively compared with WKY18.
Numerous other studies have shown that pial arteries and
arterioles from spontaneously hypertensive and SHRSP rats
have increased vasoconstriction compared with normotensive
strains that is thought to be partially responsible for increased
cerebrovascular resistance and shifting the CBF autoregulatory
curve to higher pressures in those animals (17, 18). The
increased tone in PAs from SHRSP18 animals does not appear
to be related to diminished NO responsiveness, as constriction
to NOS inhibition with L-NNA was not different from
WKY18, but dilation to SNP was significantly increased. Thus
PA smooth muscle from SHRSP18 appears more sensitive to
NO, not less sensitive, as would be expected if the increased
tone was due to a diminished effect of NO on inhibiting tone.
PAs from SHRSP18 animals did have modestly diminished
dilation to the SK/IK channel opener NS309. SK/IK channels
are expressed only in cerebrovascular endothelium and are
shown to be critical to the endothelium-derived hyperpolarization
pathway (16). Although endothelium-derived hyperpolarization
does not appear to oppose basal tone in large cerebral
arteries, we have shown that SK/IK channels are basally active
in PAs and inhibit tone (7). Thus impairment of SK/IK channel
activity or the ability to promote hyperpolarization in PAs from
SHRSP18 animals could contribute to the increased tone in
those vessels.
Interestingly, we found that PAs from SHRSP18 animals did
not have structurally smaller lumens, but did present with
medial hypertrophy (thicker walls) and increased passive distensibility
compared with WKY18. The structure of PAs in the
brain has been studied extensively in SHRSP animals to
understand cerebrovascular lesions and more recently the impact
of hypertension on progressing SVD. Structural changes
in PAs in SHRSP animals appear to depend on age, location,
and diet. Schreiber et al. (31) performed a time course study of
vascular pathology using MRI and histology in SHRSP animals
from 12 to 42 wk of age and found that small vessel
diameters were not different at any of these ages, except in the
basal ganglia, where they were larger. A similar result was
found in a study of PAs isolated from humans undergoing
tumor resection, with and without essential hypertension (28).
PAs from hypertensive patients had similar inner diameters,
but increased wall-to-lumen ratios (28), a finding that is similar
to the present study. However, other studies on SHRSP animals
have found PAs with increased wall thickness, smaller lumen
diameters, and fibrinoid degeneration of the arteriolar wall (11,
12, 19, 24, 25, 35, 40, 41). These pathologic findings are
progressed with age and in animals that have the highest blood
pressure or that are on a high-salt diet (8, 23, 35, 42). Thus
it is possible that lack of inward remodeling in PAs from
SHRSP18 in the present study was due to their relatively
young age and modestly increased blood pressures that are
lower in females than males. It is worth noting that increased
wall thickness and distensibility were seen in PAs
from both prehypertensive and hypertensive SHRSP, suggesting
an effect of strain and not hypertension per se on
vascular structure. In addition, because vascular lesions are
progressive with age and degree of hypertension, there may
be a genetic effect that makes the vasculature more sensitive
to the effects of hypertension in SHRSP animals, as has
been suggested previously (40).
PAs from SHRSP18 were compared with prehypertensive
SHRSP5 animals to distinguish between the effects of hypertension
vs. strain differences. We found that the majority of
responses, including increased tone, reactivity to NS309, increased
wall thickness, and distensibility were present in PAs
from both hypertensive and prehypertensive SHRSP animals.
While it is tempting to conclude that it was the strain and not
hypertension that caused these effects in PAs, we did not have
a control for young age, i.e., 5-wk-old WKY. However, it is
important to consider that strain may have a significant influence
on vascular reactivity and structure of the cerebrovasculature
, independent of hypertension.
There are several limitations to this study that are worth
considering. First, we did not measure CBF in any of animals,
and, therefore, we do not know the relationship between PA
vasoactivity, structure, and CBF during UCCAo or if the potent
vasodilatory response in normotensive animals contributes to
restoring CBF in those animals. Second, we did not measure
changes in the structure and function of collaterals, especially
the circle of Willis vessels that would be expected to undergo
arteriogenesis and influence CBF. It is possible that there is an
overall effect of hypertension that impairs arteriogenesis in
both noncollateral and collateral vessels that is not specific for
PAs. Third, the comparison of vessels from 18-wk-old animals
to 5-wk-old animals was not straightforward, considering the
young animals were considerably smaller in size and were still
undergoing development. To better understand the influence of
strain vs. hypertension on PAs, further studies are needed.
