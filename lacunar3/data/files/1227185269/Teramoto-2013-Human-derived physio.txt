Abstract
Although challenging, neuroprotective therapies for ischemic stroke remain an interesting strategy for countering ischemic
injury and suppressing brain tissue damage. Among potential neuroprotective molecules, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is a
strong cell death suppressor. To assess the neuroprotective effects of HSP27 in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion, we purified a ‘‘physiological’’ HSP27 (hHSP27) from normal human lymphocytes. hHSP27 differed from
recombinant HSP27 in that it formed dimeric, tetrameric, and multimeric complexes, was phosphorylated, and contained
small amounts ofab-crystallin and HSP20. Mice received intravenous injections of hHSP27 following focal cerebral ischemia.
Infarct volume, neurological deficit scores, physiological parameters, and immunohistochemical analyses were evaluated
24 h after reperfusion. Intravenous injections of hHSP27 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct size and
improved neurological deficits. Injected hHSP27 was localized in neurons on the ischemic side of the brain. hHSP27
suppressed neuronal cell death resulting from cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation, oxidative stress, and
inflammatory responses. Recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27), which was artificially expressed and purified from Escherichia coli,
and dephosphorylated hHSP27 did not have brain protective effects, suggesting that the phosphorylation of hHSP27 may
be important for neuroprotection after ischemic insults. The present study suggests that hHSP27 with posttranslational
modifications provided neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury and that the protection was mediated through
the inhibition of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Intravenously injected human HSP27 should be explored for
the treatment of acute ischemic strokes.

Introduction
Ischemic brain injury is a major health problem. Despite
numerous clinical trials, many neuroprotective therapies have
failed [1]. Protecting brain tissue from ischemic injury is a
considerable challenge in stroke treatment strategies. However,
not all brain cells die immediately after an ischemic event.
Surrounding the core of severely and rapidly injured brain tissue,
cell death spreads slowly in a heterogeneous region called the
penumbra, which is salvageable [2]. While numerous preclinical
studies demonstrated that neuroprotective strategies significantly
reduce the ischemic penumbra [3], many strategies have failed in
clinical trials for several reasons [4]. For example, reactions to
compounds and peptides may differ between test animals and
humans. We hypothesized that endogenous human proteins
should not evoke adverse reactions and might be ideal neuroprotective
molecules for treating ischemic stroke patients.
Neuronal injury after cerebral ischemia involves a complex
series of cellular stresses, including oxidative stress, inflammation,
and apoptosis, all of which can lead to cell death [5,6]. Thus,
multifunctional molecules that suppress cell death, are antiapoptotic
, and scavenge free radicals are ideal neuroprotective
agents. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) provides robust cellular
protection, is an adenosine triphosphate-independent chaperone, a
free radical scavenger, and is anti-apoptotic [7]. HSP27 undergoes
various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation
and oligomerization, and interacts with other small heat shock
proteins, such as ab-crystallin and HSP20 [8], influencing its
oligomeric state and regulating its function [9,10].
HSP27-transgenic cell and mouse lines exhibit numerous
cytoprotective effects in in vivo models of various diseases,
including cardiac ischemia [11,12], kainate-induced hippocampal
cell death [13], and nerve injury [14], in the tau model of

Alzheimer disease [15,16], and in the SOD1G93A model of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [17]. HSP27-transgenic mice exhibit
reduced infarcts after transient cerebral ischemia [18], and viral
delivery of HSP27 and intraperitoneal injection of PEP1-HSP27,
but not HSP27 recombinant protein, into ischemic animal models
are also protective [19,20]. Finally, endogenous induction of
HSP27 was observed in ischemia-surviving cells [21] and in
ischemic preconditioning models [22,23], suggesting that HSP27 is
associated with cellular survival following cerebral ischemia.
Phosphorylation and oligomerization of HSP27 are both essential
for mediating neuroprotection against ischemic neuronal injury in
HSP27 transgenic mouse models [24]. All of which suggest that
HSP27 is a strong candidate molecule for brain protection against
ischemic insults, and led us to hypothesize that posttranslationally
modified HSP27 might be a better treatment therapy than nonmodified
recombinant HSP27. We tested this hypothesis by
purifying HSP27 from human lymphocytes (hHSP27) and
demonstrated that it attenuated ischemic brain damage in a
mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO).
Materials and Methods
HSP27 Antibodies
We generated 2 anti-HSP27 rabbit polyclonal antibodies: anti-
HSP27-N1 against the 15-mer sequence MTERRVPFSLLRGPC
at the N-terminal domain of human HSP27 and anti-HSP27-C1
against the 15-mer sequence CGGPEAAKSDETAAK at the C-
terminal domain of human HSP27.
Human Physiological HSP27 Preparation
Heparinized human peripheral blood (40 mL) was obtained
from two normal control subjects and separated by density
gradient centrifugation in Lympholyte-H (Cedarlane Laboratories
Ltd., Hornby, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, and 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)
with a Dounce homogenizer, and the lysate was centrifuged at
10,0006g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to an HSP27-N1
antibody affinity column, and the column was washed with lysis
buffer. HSP27 was eluted by peptide antigen (10 mg/mL) for the
HSP27-N1 antibody. The eluate was further applied to an HSP27-
C1 antibody affinity column, and the column was washed with
lysis buffer. HSP27 was eluted by a 10-mg/mL excess amount of
HSP27-C1 antibody peptide antigen. HSP27 was separated from
the peptide with Amicon Ultra-10 centrifugal filter units (Millipore
, Billerica, MA, USA). The purity of the hHSP27 protein was
over 95%. The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in
the Declaration of Helsinki, and was reviewed and approved by
the Juntendo University Ethics Committee. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
MS/MS Identification of hHSP27
hHSP27 was separated by native or SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue. For protein spot analysis, including MS (Mass
Spectrometry)/MS and MASCOT search analysis, we used the
technical services of ProPhoenix Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan).
Experimental Protocol
Animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of Juntendo University. Eight-week-old adult male
C57BL/6 mice weighing 20–23 g were housed under controlled
lighting and provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were
subjected to transient, 1-h MCAO, and then randomly divided
into 3 groups: (1) an hHSP27 group that received tail-vein
injections of hHSP27 after reperfusion, (2) a control group that
received intravenous injections of 50 mg of bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and (3) a sham-operated group that underwent the same
procedure without MCAO. During this procedure, body temperature
was maintained at 37.060.5uC with a heating pad. Systolic
blood pressure was monitored by a noninvasive tail-cuff system
(Softron BP-98A NIBP, Softron Co., Ltd.) in conscious mice. The
selected dose and schedule of hHSP27 treatments were based on
preliminary experiments that used 5 or 50 mg/mouse hHSP27
administered 0 (immediately), 1, 3, or 6 h after reperfusion (n = 3
in each group). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by
laser Doppler flowmetry before, during, and after MCAO, and
before the mice were sacrificed. 24 h after reperfusion, mice were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital
and decapitated. To evaluate infarct area and volume, brain
slices were stained with cresyl violet or 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride, scanned with AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss Micro-
Imaging GmbH), and measured using the ImageJ program (NIH,
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) [25].
Neurological Evaluation
Neurological functions were evaluated by the following modified
scoring system: 0, no observable neurological deficits (normal);
1, failure to extend forepaw when entire body is lifted by tail
(mild); 2, circling to contralateral side (moderate); and 3, loss of
walking or righting reflex (severe) [26]. Three mice were tested in
each group, and each mouse was subjected to 3 rounds of each
test. The observers of the behavioral tests were blinded to the
treatment groups, and mice of the various groups were randomized
during a given testing period.
hHSP27 and HSP27 Antibody, HSP27 Elution Peptide
Administration or Recombinant HSP27 Administration
Mice received intravenous injections of 50 mg of hHSP27 mixed
with 50 or 500 mg of HSP27-N1 or -C1 antibody 1 h after
reperfusion (n = 3 in each group), 5 or 50 mg of HSP27-N1 and -
C1 peptides, which were used in the elution, intravenously 1 h
after reperfusion (n = 3 in each group), or 50 mg of recombinant
HSP27 (rHSP27; Acris Antibodies GmbH) 1 h after reperfusion
(n = 3).
Dephosphorylated hHSP27 Administration
hHSP27 was dephosphorylated by active recombinant protein
phosphatase 2A (Millipore) [16]. Mice received intravenous
injections of 50 mg of dephosphorylated hHSP27 1 h after
reperfusion (n =3).
Identification of Transition in Brain Parenchyma by
Intravenous hHSP27 Injection
hHSP27 was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (KPL, Inc.). Mice were
administered 50 mg of FITC-hHSP27 intravenously 1 h after
reperfusion and anesthetized with pentobarbital 30 min after the
injection. Their brains were immediately removed, soaked in
Tissue-TekH OCTTM Compound (SAKURA, Netherland), and
frozen on liquid nitrogen. Coronal sections (20 mm) were cut on a
cryostat (CM 1900, Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch,
Germany). The sections were immediately, or after incubation
with Alexa FluorH 555 Conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore
), mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector

Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The sections were
examined with an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope
(Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH).
TUNEL Assay
For in situ DNA fragmentation detection, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) was carried out with an in situ cell death detection kit
(TMR Red, Roche Diagnostics GmbH) [27].
Fractionation of Mouse Brain
Twenty-fourhoursafterreperfusion,abrainsamplewasharvested

buffer (320 mmol/L sucrose, 4 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4) with
Complete Mini, EDTA-free, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I
and II (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Tissues were homogenized with a glass-
Teflon homogenizer (12 up/down strokes, 900 rpm). The homogenized
sample was centrifuged at 3,0006gfor 5 min (step 1), and the
supernatant was centrifuged at 12,0006g for 10 min (step 2). The
resultingpelletwasresuspendedinisolationmediaandcentrifugedat
3,0006g for 5 min to remove nuclear contamination (step 3). The
supernatantfromstep3wascentrifugedat12,0006gfor10 min(step
4). Steps 3 and 4 were repeated twice to further purify the
mitochondrial fraction. The resulting pellet from the 12,0006gspin
was the mitochondria-enriched fraction. The supernatant obtained
from step 2 was centrifuged at 70,0006g for 60 min (step 5). The
resulting supernatant was the soluble cytosolic fraction. The pellet
fractions were resuspended in isolation media. The purity of the
fractions was tested by immunoblotting with a rabbit Tom20
antibody (mitochondrial marker; 1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology
, Inc.). Protein loading was confirmed in cytosolic fractions by
immunoblotting with mouse anti-actin antibody (1:10,000; Millipore
). The protein concentration in each fraction was determined
with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.,
Rockford, IL, USA), and the fractions were subjected to immunoblotting
with anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:1,000).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 20-mm free-floating
sections. Sections were stained overnight using HSP27 C-1, rabbit
anti-cytochrome c (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly,
MA, USA), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-9 (1:50; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:200; Cell

Institute for the Control of Aging), rabbit anti-ionized calciumbinding
adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1; 1:500; Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP; 1:500; Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA,
USA) antibodies. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibodies (1:300; Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and subsequently
processed with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex
(Vectastain ABC kit; 1:400; Vector Laboratories, Inc.).
PAGE and Immunoblotting
Each mouse brain sample was obtained from the ischemic
region of cortex and striatum on the operated side 24 h after
reperfusion. Frozen human brain (78-year-old who died of bladder
cancer) was obtained from the temporal cortex. SDS-PAGE
experiments were performed with the NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris
Gel system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen
, Carlsbad, CA). The most frequently used SDS gel was a 4–
12% gradient gel. Native–PAGE experiments were performed
with the NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel System according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The most frequently used native gel
was a 4–16% gradient gel. To this solution, an additional
detergent to be tested was added at a final concentration of
0.4% [1.0% in the case of n-octyl-b-d-glucoside (b-OG)] and
incubated for 10 min prior to blue native–PAGE. To each lane of
a native gel, 3–5 mg of protein were loaded. Anode buffer was
made by diluting the 206NativePAGE running buffer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), and the cathode buffer by mixing the NativePAGE
running buffer with Cathode Buffer additive (Coomassie Blue G-
250 dye, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For BN–PAGE with membrane proteins, the concentration of the
blue dye was 0.02%(w/v), which is tenfold higher than that for
soluble proteins. The gel was stained using the Colloidal Blue
Staining Kit (Invitrogen). Block Ace (Daiichi Kogyo Seiyaku, Co.,
Ltd., Gifu, Japan) or PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-
Aldrich Co.) was used for blocking. Membranes with transferred
proteins were incubated overnight with antibodies against HHE
(1:1,000; Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd Carlsbad CA), and reacted with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000;
GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Immunoreactive
bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Protein loading of lanes
was assessed with a-tubulin immunoreactivity (53 kDa).

Results
Purification of Human HSP27
To examine the effects of HSP27 on ischemic injury, we initially
injected recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) into ischemic model mice,
butdidnotobserveanyinfarctsuppression(datanotshown).Because
rHSP27 is not phosphorylated and occurs in large oligomers, we
decided to use human physiological HSP27 for subsequent studies
because it is phosphorylated (at S15, S78, and S82) and reorganizes
from large oligomers into dimers, tetramers, and multimers in
response to many insults and interacts with other small HSPs [7]. To
obtain physiological HSP27, we purified HSP27 from human
lymphocytes (hHSP27) with 2 human-specific HSP27-antibody
affinity columns. The resulting protein purity was more than 95%
(Figure 1A). We found more dimeric, tetrameric, and multimeric
configurations and fewer large oligomers of hHSP27 than those of
rHSP27 (Figure 1B), and increased phosphorylation (Figure 1C). A
mass spectrometric analysis revealed that a high molecular weight
hHSP27 multimer contained HSP27 andab-crystallin and HSP20.
We also identified the peptides,

, which are consistent with the abcrystallin
protein sequence (gi2845682); and MEIPVPVQPSWLR
and HEERPDEHGFVAR, which are consistent with the HSP20
protein sequence (gi2477511). The hHSP27 dimer and tetramer
contained only HSP27 withoutab-crystallin and HSP20. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that the high molecular weight hHSP27
multimer contained ab-crystallin and HSP20 (Figure 1D). Both
immunoblot and mass spectrometric analyses (data not shown)
revealed that rHSP27 contained only HSP27 and notab-crystallin
and HSP20. Ten nanograms of hHSP27 contained less than 0.5 ng
each of ab-crystallin and HSP20, that is, the amount of HSP27
containedinthehHSP27wasmorethan20timesthatofab-crystallin
and HSP20 (Figure 1E). The amounts of ab-crystallin and HSP20
were determined by comparing them with known amounts of their
respective commercial recombinant proteins. We also chose to use
hHSP27insubsequentstudies,becausehHSP27subjectedtovarious
physiologicalposttranslationalmodificationsmayinfluencefunction.
hHSP27 Attenuates Ischemic Brain Damage
The HSP27 treatment protocol was first determined in
preliminary experiments. Ischemic mice (see Methods) were
intravenously injected with either hHSP27 (5 or 50 mg) or BSA
(50 mg) 0, 1, 3, or 6 h after reperfusion (Figure 2A), and infarct
volumes were measured in cresyl violet-stained sections made 24 h
after reperfusion (Figure 2B). Infarct volume was reduced by 37%
in mice treated 0 h after reperfusion with 5 mg of hHSP27
(19.4961.12 mm3, P,0.001, n =5) and by 61% in those treated
with 50 mg of hHSP27 (12.3960.73 mm3, P,0.001, n = 5) vs.
BSA-treated controls (31.5561.28 mm3; n = 5, Figure 2B,C).
Infarct volume tended to be reduced more when the 50-mg dose
was administered 1 h after reperfusion (63% reduction;
11.7161.36 mm3, P,0.001, n = 5); there was only a slight
reduction at 3 h and no difference at 6 h after reperfusion vs.
controls (Figure 2C). The hHSP27 group showed better functional
recoveries [hHSP27 (0 h): P=0.004, hHSP27 (1 h): P= 0.004]
than controls (Figure 2D). There was no difference in regional
cerebral blood flow between the treated and control groups
(Figure 2E). Based on these findings, in the remaining experiments
, we injected 50 mg of hHSP27 1 h after reperfusion because
it was most effective in reducing infarct volume (Figure 2F).
Significant reductions in infarct volume and neurological deficits
were also found 72 h after reperfusion in mice injected with 50 mg
of hHSP27 at 1 h (16.4360.69 mm3 P,0.001, n = 3) vs. controls
(38.0960.24 mm3 n = 3) (Figure 3A,B,C).
To exclude the possibility that molecules co-purified with
HSP27, such as ab-crystallin and HSP20, attenuated ischemic
brain damage, we administered hHSP27 in the presence of
HSP27-N1 and -C1 antibodies or HSP27-elution peptides
(HSP27-N1 and -C1 peptides), instead of HSP27. The coadministration
of hHSP27 and HSP27 antibody (50 mg hHSP27
and 50 mg HSP27 antibodies: 26.2860.93 mm3 n = 3; 50 mg
hHSP27 and 500 mg HSP27 antibodies: 29.7960.93 mm3 n=3)
resulted in infarct volumes that were not significantly different
from control (Figure 3A). The HSP27 antibody inhibited the
protective effects of hHSP27, indicating hHSP27 as the source of
cellular protection and not other co-purified molecules. The
administration of HSP27 elution peptides had no effect on
ischemic brain damage (Figure 4A).
Nonphosphorylated rHSP27 purified from Escherichia coli also
did not reduce infarct volume (50 mg rHSP27:31.4160.27 mm3;
Figure 1. Characterization of hHSP27. A–B, Isolated human heat shock protein 27 (hHSP27) or recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) proteins (1 mgor

antibodies against HSP27, phosphorylated S15 HSP27, S78 HSP27, and S82 HSP27. D, hHSP27 proteins were separated by native-PAGE and
immunoblotted with antibodies against ab-crystallin and HSP20. E, rHSP27 (10 ng), hHSP27 (10 ng), ab-crystallin (5 ng), and HSP20 (5 ng) were
separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against HSP27, ab-crystallin, and HSP20.

Figure 4A). Treating hHSP27 with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
[16], which dephosphorylates hHSP27 at S15, S78, and S82,
increased the large oligomers and decreased the dimers, tetramers,
and multimers (Figure 4B, C, D). Dephosphorylated hHSP27 did
not reduce infarct volume (50 mg dephosphorylated
hHSP27:31.2460.41 mm3; Figure 4A and E). These results
indicated that physiologically phosphorylated hHSP27 elicited
neuroprotection.
Localization of (FITC)-hHSP27 in Brain Parenchyma after
Injection
To obtain direct evidence of hHSP27 localization in brain, we
injected fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-hHSP27. To preserve
the FITC-hHSP27 signal, we made fresh frozen sections. FITC-
hHSP27 was diffusely localized in brain (Fig. 5A,B). FITC-HSP27
also localized in neuronal marker protein NeuN-positive cells
(Figure 5C–H), indicating that FITC-hHSP27 was localized in
neurons. FITC-hHSP27 was also localized in NeuN-negative cells.
We found larger amounts of FITC-HSP27 on the ischemic side
than on the non-ischemic side of brain.
hHSP27 Suppressed Apoptotic Cell Death, Oxidative DNA
Damage, Lipid Peroxidation and Glial Activation
The numbers of cells immunopositive for cytochrome c, cleaved
caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3, and the number of terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling
(TUNEL)-positive cells 24 h after reperfusion were
significantly lower (P=0.00024) in the hHSP27 group than in
the controls (Figure 6A,B). Cytochrome c levels (15 kDa) in
cytosolic fractions were also significantly lower (P= 0.00016) in the
hHSP27 group vs. controls (Figure 6C,D). Because expansion of
the damaged area following an ischemic insult has been attributed
to immediate and direct cytotoxic effects of oxidative products
[28,29], we examined the effects of hHSP27 on levels of 8-
hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidized nucleoside of
DNA, and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), a major lipid peroxidation
product. The numbers of cells immunopositive for these
oxidative stress markers 24 h after reperfusion were significantly
lower (P,0.001) in the hHSP27 group vs. controls (Figure 7A,B).
The numbers of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-
1)-positive activated microglia and astrocytes 24 h after reperfusion
, were also significantly lower (P,0.001) in the hHSP27 group
vs. controls (Figure 7A,B).
Discussion
In our experiments, delayed intravenous injections of phosphorylated
, multimeric hHSP27 complexes following reperfusion
after transient MCAO reduced infarct volume, neurological
deficits, and apoptotic cell death, and at the same time decreased
TUNEL reactions and the levels of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-
9, and cleaved caspase-3. The hHSP27 complex also decreased
oxidative DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and glial activation.
Thus, hHSP27 appears to protect brain by inhibiting apoptosis
and oxidative stress following ischemia and reperfusion. We also
confirmed that it was the HSP27 that protected the brain, as a
specific anti-HSP27 antibody inhibited the protective effects.

Administered hHSP27 crossed the blood-brain barrier injured by
ischemic insults and was localized in neurons on the ischemic side
of brains, where it prevented apoptosis and oxidative stress and
thereby neuronal death.
The more physiological hHSP27 (i.e., the phosphorylated
multimeric complex) and not rHSP27 protected ischemic brains
against damage. HSP27 tends to form variable-sized oligomers
[30–32], depending on posttranslational modifications. Phosphorylation
leads to the formation of small oligomers [30,31,33],
monomers, and dimers [34,35], which act as molecular chaperones
, interfere with caspase activation, modulate oxidative stress,
and regulate the cytoskeleton [7]. hHSP27 formed more dimers,

tetramers, and multimers and less large oligomers than rHSP27.
Dephosphorylation of hHSP27 increased the large oligomers and
decreased the dimers, tetramers, and multimers, resulting in a loss
of its protective effects. Phosphorylation may be a key factor in
brain protection. Our results suggested that the injection of
phosphorylated dimeric, tetrameric, and multimeric hHSP27 was
important for brain protection in our model of ischemia/
reperfusion. We speculated that intravenously injected hHSP27
may not only increase the concentration of endogenous HSP25,
which is the mouse homolog of HSP27, but also may have a novel
exposure effect to the neurons. hHSP27 was also localized in
extracellular space in brain, and usually the concentration of
HSP27 was very low in the extracellualr space. Further studies will
be needed to ascertain the mechanisms by which intravenously
injected hHSP27 provides neuronal cell protection.
Isolated hHSP27 also contained small amounts of ab-crystalline
and HSP20, which were part of high molecular weight HSP27
oligomers. Because they were co-purified with antibodies specific
for HSP27 suggests that they were not simple contaminations, but
that they interact with HSP27 in a sort of hHSP27 complex.

Previous studies showed that because of similarity in structure and
properties, HSP27, ab-crystallin, and HSP20 are co-purified [36];
thus, the possibility exists that the ab-crystallin and HSP20, which
are part of the hHSP27 complex, may influence the effects of brain
protection. We showed, however, that co-administration of
hHSP27 in the presence of a specific anti-HSP27 antibody
decreased the ability of hHSP27 to protect the brain against
ischemic injury, strongly suggesting that most of the brain
protective effect of hHSP27 was caused by HSP27. The necessary
modifications of rHSP27, including phosphorylation and interaction
withab-crystalline and HSP20, to mimic hHSP27 in ischemic
brain treatment need to be identified.
The blood brain barrier (BBB) controls the passage of
substances from the blood into the CNS [37]. Usually, injected
proteins are hampered from reaching brain neurons by the tight
regulation of the BBB. We observed peripherally injected FITCHSP27
in neurons, indicating that FITC-HSP27 crossed the BBB
and then entered neurons. Increased numbers of FITC-hHSP27-
positive neurons on the ischemic side of the brain compared to the
non-ischemic side suggests that the injured BBB enabled the
FITC-hHSP27 to pass. Further studies are needed to elucidate the
mechanism by which hHSP27 crosses the injured BBB and enters
neurons.
HSP27 was shown to attenuate ischemic brain damage in
transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 [18,38] and when it was
delivered via viral HSP27 expression vectors [20,39] or injected as
the PEP-1-HSP27 protein [40]. There are, however, some
differences between our study and the PEP-1-HSP27 study. An
et al. used a delayed mouse model of neuronal cell death, a special
ischemic model, whereby delayed neuronal death, caused by a
very short 5-min artery occlusion, is mainly observed only in the
hippocampus, and PEP-1-HSP27 was injected before the ischemic
insult. By contrast, we used the more usual MCAO model of
ischemia and administered hHSP27 after the ischemic insult,
which is closer to the treatment paradigm that patients with
ischemic stroke would experience. Ischemic damage was suppressed
by the delayed, intravenous administration of hHSP27
after MCAO, as it would be administered to patients with brain
infarctions. Although a delay of 1 h was more effective than 3 h,
which would be difficult to accomplish in ischemic stroke patients,
the necessary administration times may be different in human
patients than in mice. Administering HSP27 viral vectors to
patients may be dangerous, because HSP27 levels are significantly
increased in many tumors [41,42,43,44] and increased HSP27
expression correlates with increased resistance to cytotoxic
(antineoplastic) compounds [41,42,45].
Because hHSP27 was purified from human tissues, the HSP27
effects in humans should not be affected by interspecies influences.
Hence, hHSP27 has potential as a medical intervention to
suppress cell death in ischemic stroke patients. We propose that
delayed injection of human-derived HSP27 may salvage brain
tissue and improve function following cerebral ischemia as well as
other vascular diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. In the
future, we intend to purify hHSP27 from a patient with acute
stroke and subsequently inject the hHSP27 solution into the
patient.
