Abstract Chronic infection of Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) in ischemic stroke (IS) incidence has been previously
studied in several publications; however, conflicting
results have been reported. A meta-analysis was used to
assess whether chronic infection of H. pylori was associated
with risk of IS, and which of the following was more
effective for predication of IS risk, antibody IgG of
H. pylori (anti-H. pylori IgG), antibody IgG of cytotoxinassociated
gene-A (anti-Cag A IgG) or the 13C-urea breath
test. We searched the databases of Medline and Embase,
and latest update was January 1, 2012. Case–control studies
were considered to be eligible. The odds ratio (OR) and
95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated using
the random-effect model. A total of 13 studies including
4,041 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Of
these studies, ten, four and four studies were for anti-H.
pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG and the 13C-urea breath test,
respectively. Combined analysis indicated that positive
anti-H. pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG and 13C-urea breath test
were significantly associated with increased risk of IS,
respectively, and positive anti-Cag A IgG was more
effective for predication of IS risk [OR (95 % CI) = 1.60
(1.21–2.11), P
heterogeneity
= 0.001 for positive versus negative
anti-H. pylori IgG; 2.33 (1.76–3.09), P
heterogeneity
= 0.71 for positive versus negative anti-Cag A IgG and
1.65 (1.11–2.47), P
heterogeneity
= 0.17 for positive versus
negative 13C-urea breath test]. In addition, we found that
positive anti-H. pylori IgG was closely associated with risk
of IS caused by atherosclerosis and small artery disease,
but not for cardioembolic IS. This meta-analysis indicated
that chronic H. pylori infection was significantly associated
with an increased risk of IS, especially for non-cardioembolic
IS. Compared with anti-H. pylori IgG and the 13C-
urea breath test, anti-Cag A IgG seemed more effective for
prediction of risk of IS.

Introduction
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative, spiralshaped
bacterium. Infection of H. pylori always occurs in
childhood and persists throughout a lifetime. Although the
incidence of H. pylori infection has been decreasing in
developed countries, there are large proportions of Asian
populations with H. pylori infection, especially for Chinese
, Japanese and Koreans [1, 2]. It is well known that
infection of H. pylori can cause various diseases, such as
chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer [3]. In
addition, previous studies have indicated that infection of
H. pylori might modify risk of ischemic stroke (IS) [4–6].
Stroke is a major health problem worldwide because of
its high risks of morbidity and mortality [7]. According to
the 2005 WHO report, about 5.7 million deaths are caused
by stroke, and over 50 % of cases occurred in Asians [8, 9].
Similarly, there are about 150 per 100,000 incidence of
stroke in Americans [10]. IS accounts for over 50 % of all
types of stroke cases, and inflammation and inflammation-

related atherosclerosis play a crucial role in IS progress and
prognosis [11].
It has been presumed that chronic infection of H. pylori
contributes to the high incidence of atherosclerosis, and
subsequently to IS occurrence [12, 13]. To date, many
epidemiological studies have studied the association
between chronic H. pylori infection and risk of IS [4–6,
14–17], by testing antibody IgG of H. pylori (anti-H. pylori
IgG), antibody IgG of cytotoxin-associated gene-A (anti-
Cag A IgG) or the 13C-urea breath test; however, the results
in these studies were controversial. In 2004, a meta-analysis
based on a limited number of primary studies suggested
that chronic infection of H. pylori was associated
with increased risk of stroke [18], and the findings were
proved in several later studies [17, 19–23]. As the authors
stated, there were limitations for this meta-analysis. The
limited number of eligible studies and participants might
weaken the statistical power to obtain a reliable conclusion.
In addition, various types of stroke were included into this
meta-analysis, which was at high risk of introduction of
bias. As we know, hemorrhagic stroke has little association
with inflammation and atherosclerosis, and also with
H. pylori infection.
Based on the above reasons, the aims of this metaanalysis
were, first, to determine whether H. pylori infection
was associated with risk of IS and, second, which of
the following was more effective for prediction of IS risk:
anti-H. pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG or the 13C-urea breath
test.
Subjects and methods
This meta-analysis was conducted followed by modified
PRISMA guidelines [24], which was more suitable for a
genetic meta-analysis.
Literature search
We searched the databases of Medline (1950–January 1,
2012) and Embase (1966–January 1, 2012) to identify
potentially eligible studies. The following key words were
used: (‘‘Helicobacter pylori’’ OR ‘‘H. pylori’’ OR ‘‘Cag
A’’) AND (‘‘stroke’’) AND (‘‘risk’’ OR ‘‘incidence’’ OR
‘‘susceptibility’’ OR ‘‘contributor’’).The reference lists of
all eligible studies were also manually reviewed. All
searching was conducted on human subjects.
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were listed as
below. First, the study must be a case–control design and
written in English. Second, the study must have explored
the association between H. pylori infection and risk of IS,
by testing anti-H. pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG or the 13C-
urea breath test. Third, the study must make sure that the
cases were diagnosed as IS. One study [19] claimed that the
case group contained 68.3 % of IS and 31.2 % of transient
ischemic attack (for a total of 59 patients with transient
ischemic attack), and was included in this meta-analysis.
Another case–control study including 238 patients conducted
by Markus et al. [4] also included some patients
with transient ischemic attack, and was included in this
meta-analysis. Fourth, the study must provide sufficient
data for further combined analysis. If more than one publication
used the same data series, the study that provided
more useful information or the latest publication was
selected.
Eligible study identification and data extraction
Figure 1 shows detail information for eligible study identification
and reasons for study exclusion. Finally, 13
studies meeting inclusion criteria were included in this
meta-analysis [4–6, 14–17, 19–23, 25]. A standard form
was used by two authors (ZW Wang and Y Li) to independently
extract the following data: first author’s surname
, publication year, participants’ countries, number of
cases and controls, testing methods for H. pylori infection,
judgment standard for positivity and negativeness of
H. pylori infection, IS subtypes, inclusion and exclusion for
cases and controls, and other data for combined analysis.
Assessment of quality of eligible studies
The quality of the original studies was assessed using the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), which was specially
designed for case–control or cohort studies (available at
http://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.
asp). The NOS contains three parts, and a maximum of four,
two and three stars (points) were given for the Selection,
Comparability and Exposure parts, respectively, if satisfied.
Therefore, an original study could be maximally awarded 9
points. If less than 6 points were awarded, the studies were
regarded as poor quality; otherwise, the studies were regarded
as high quality.
Statistical methods
Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval
(95 % CI) were calculated to present the strength of
association between H. pylori infection and risk of IS.
Adjusted OR and 95 % CI from original studies were
extracted and transferred into logarithm for combined
analysis. Seven studies [5, 6, 14–17, 19, 25] did not report
the OR and corresponding 95 % CI, which were calculated

by using the v2 test without confounder adjustment. In
addition, standard error of logOR was also calculated for
combined and sensitive analyses as well as publication
bias. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the
Q-statistical test, and P\ 0.10 indicated obvious heterogeneity
[26, 27]. Given the heterogeneity among original
studies with respect to different sources of participants and
cut-off for positive result judgment, the random-effect
model by using the DerSimonian and Laird method (D–L
method) [28] as a conservative measure was used to calculate
the pooled OR and 95 % CI. Meanwhile, subgroup
analyses were conducted for IS subtypes if possible. Sensitivity
analysis was conducted to make sure whether
pooled results were substantially influenced by a single
study; namely, re-analyses were conducted when the original
studies were omitted one at a time. Asymmetry of
funnel plot indicated the existing of possible publication
bias. Begger and Egger’s linear regression tests [29, 30]
were also used to diagnose the potential publication bias,
and P\ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. According
to a suggestion of the Cochrane handbook, testing for
heterogeneity, sensitive analysis and testing for publication
bias were conducted if the number of studies was more
than five [29, 30].
In this meta-analysis, all statistical tests were performed
using STATA software (version 12.0; Stata Corporation,
College Station, TX, USA) with a two-sided P value.
Results
Basic information for included studies
A total of 13 studies with 1,960 cases and 2,081 controls
were included in this meta-analysis [4–6, 14–17, 19–23,
25]. Tables 1 and 2 show detailed information concerning
these studies. Among these studies, 10, 4 and 4 studies
reported anti-H. pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG or the 13C-urea
breath test, respectively. Five studies reported the specific
subtypes of IS [4, 5, 14, 20, 21, 23]. All of the studies
clearly stated the methods for diagnosis of IS. The qualities
of original studies were comparatively good (8 studies
were of high quality and 4 studies were of poor quality).

associated with an increased risk of IS, and OR (95 %
CI) was 1.60 (1.21–2.11). Between-study heterogeneity
was observed, and the P value was 0.001. Subgroup
analyses based on original studies with or without confounder
adjustment still indicated a significant association
between positive anti-H. pylori IgG and increased risk of
IS (Fig. 2).
According to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke
Treatment criteria [23], IS was divided into atherothrombosis
, small artery disease and cardioembolism for subgroup
analyses. Figure 3a–c showed the results of
subgroup analyses. We found that, compared with a negative
result, positive anti-H. pylori IgG was associated with
increased risk of IS due to atherothrombosis and small
artery disease, rather than that due to cardioembolism.
Figure 4 showed that no single study had a substantial
influence on the pooled results. However, publication bias
existed, and P values for Begger and Egger tests were 0.03

Discussion
In recent decades, meta-analysis as an important statistical
method has been widely used in medical research to draw
more reliable conclusions when controversial results are
reported by many studies for the same topic [31]. Although
various factors contribute to controversial results, small
sample size of a single study is crucial due to the low
power of statistics. In contrast, the biggest advantage of a
meta-analysis is that it can increase the sample size and
greatly improves the statistical power to draw a more
reliable result.
The association between H. pylori infection and risk of
IS has been widely studied since 1998 [4]; however, it is
still an unsolved issue due to conflicting results having
been reported. A case–control study with 145 cases and
160 controls by Heuschmann et al. [5] indicated that
H. pylori seropositivity was not associated with risk of IS.
However, in subgroup analyses they found that H. pylori
seropositivity was associated with a 3.31-fold risk of IS
caused by small artery occlusion and a 0.21-fold risk of
cardioembolic stroke. Similarly, a case–control study with
150 Chinese patients and 131 controls in 2011 [23] indicated
that H. pylori seropositivity was not associated with
risk of IS and its subtypes. Nevertheless, several studies
[17, 20, 21] have reported that chronic H. pylori infection
was positively associated with risk of IS. A case–control
study with 62 acute IS and 143 healthy controls by
Sawayama et al. [20] suggested that H. pylori seropositivity
was significantly associated with increased risk of IS,
especially for small artery occlusion. The positive association
was also reported by another two studies [17, 21]. In
addition, all original studies [6, 14, 19, 22] indicated that
positive anti-Cag A IgG was significantly associated with
increased risk of IS. This meta-analysis indicated that anti-
H. pylori IgG, anti-Cag A IgG and the 13C-urea breath test
were significantly associated with an increased risk of IS,
especially for IS caused by atherothrombosis and small
artery disease. We believed that the findings of this study
were interesting and could be used to identify persons at
high risk of IS and, subsequently, for prevention of its
incidence.
The mechanisms of chronic H. pylori infection on high
risk of IS are still not completely understood. Previous
animal and epidemiological studies have indicated that
chronic inflammation and autoimmune processes caused
by chronic H. pylori infection promoted atherosclerosis
and incidences of atherosclerosis-related diseases such as
stroke and coronary artery disease [13, 32, 33]. An
observed study including 462 old Koreans [34] indicated
that H. pylori infection was significantly associated with a
high low-density protein (LDL) level, supporting the
hypothesis that H. pylori infection contributed to the
atherosclerotic process. Our study indicated that positive
anti-H. pylori IgG was associated with a 1.92-, 2.86- and
0.62-fold risk of IS caused by atherothrombosis, small
artery disease and cardioembolism, respectively, which
supported that atherosclerosis caused by H. pylori infection
played an essential role in IS formation. Because of
the essential role of atherosclerosis in ischemic stroke
caused by H. pylori infection, individuals with susceptible
factors of atherosclerosis, e.g., old age, obesity, high blood

pressure, may be considered as proper populations for
testing H. pylori infection to identify whether they are at
high risk of ischemic stroke incidence [35].
Another important finding of this meta-analysis was
that, compared with anti-H. pylori IgG and the 13C-urea
breath test, positive anti-Cag A IgG was mostly associated
with the risk of IS. Cytotoxic CagA-positive H. pylori
strains have been confirmed to be associated with occurrence
and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques [33]. A
case–control study including 199 patients and 151 controls
by Pietroiusti et al. [14] showed that positive anti-Cag A
IgG was associated with 4.30-fold risk of atherosclerotic
stroke compared with controls; however, no association
between positive anti-H. pylori IgG and risk of IS was
observed. Another study [36] based on 159 coronary artery
disease patients indicated that positive anti-Cag A IgG was
associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL and
apolipoprotein B as well as more serious coronary atherosclerosis
compared with negative anti-Cag A IgG
patients.
Compared with anti-H. pylori IgG and anti-Cag A IgG,
the 13C-urea breath test, examining current infection of H.
pylori, was the least sensitive index for predicting risk of IS
in our meta-analysis. Overall analysis indicated that a
positive 13C-urea breath test was associated with a 1.65-
fold risk of IS. However, the association was substantially
weakened when excluding the studies without confounder
adjustment [6]. This result might suggest that acute H.

pylori in a short period might have little effect on incidence
of IS. Actually, this hypothesis has been proved by two
case–control studies [17, 25], which reported that anti-H.
pylori IgA, indicating current infection of H. pylori, did not
have any risk of IS.
The results of this meta-analysis should be explained with
caution as modest limitations and potential bias might exist.
First, despite a perfect literature searching strategy being
used to identify eligible studies, it was possible that a few
studies meeting the inclusion criteria were not included.
Second, the number of participants was comparatively small
for Anti-Cag A IgG and C-urea breath test analyses, and it
was thus impossible to conduct a subgroup analysis for IS
subtypes. Third, some studies were conducted without confounder
adjustment. When combined analyses were conducted
based on these studies, the results might be distorted.
Fourth, the interactions between H. pylori infection and other
factors, such as different ethnics, age and nutrition status, on
the risk of IS could not be analyzed due to limitations of the
original studies and should be studied in the future.
In summary, this study indicated that, although modest
limitations existed, chronic H. pylori infection was significantly
associated with increased risk of IS, especially for
non-cardioembolic IS. Compared with anti-H. pylori IgG
and the 13C-urea breath test, anti-Cag A IgG seemed more
effective for prediction of risk of IS.
