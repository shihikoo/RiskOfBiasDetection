Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid complexed to albumin (DHA-Alb) is highly neuroprotective after temporary middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo), but whether a similar effect occurs in permanent MCAo is unknown. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (270–
330 g) underwent permanent MCAo. Neurological function was evaluated on days 1, 2 and 3 after MCAo. We studied six
groups: DHA (5 mg/kg), Alb (0.63 or 1.25 g/kg), DHA-Alb (5 mg/kg+0.63 g/kg or 5 mg/kg+1.25 g/kg) or saline. Treatment
was administered i.v. at 3 h after onset of stroke (n = 7–10 per group). Ex vivo imaging of brains and histopathology were
conducted on day 3. Saline- and Alb-treated rats developed severe neurological deficits but were not significantly different
from one another. In contrast, rats treated with low and moderate doses of DHA-Alb showed improved neurological score
compared to corresponding Alb groups on days 2 and 3. Total, cortical and subcortical lesion volumes computed from T2
weighted images were reduced following a moderate dose of DHA-Alb (1.25 g/kg) by 25%, 22%, 34%, respectively,
compared to the Alb group. The total corrected, cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were reduced by low (by 36–40%)
and moderate doses (by 34–42%) of DHA-Alb treatment compared to the Alb groups. In conclusion, DHA-Alb therapy is
highly neuroprotective in permanent MCAo in rats. This treatment can provide the basis for future therapeutics for patients
suffering from ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality worldwide. Tissue plasminogen activator, tPA, is
currently the only therapeutic option available for stroke
treatment. Its thrombolytic properties provide a means to break
up blood clots during the hyper-acute phase of stroke, allowing for
reperfusion of the ischemic area. Unfortunately, the use of tPA is
restricted by a narrow therapeutic window (it is only approved to
be administered up to 4.5 h after stroke onset) and has multiple
absolute contraindications, especially for individuals with any
increased bleeding risk. As a result, only 3%–5% of patients
qualify for this therapy. In pre-clinical studies, the neuroprotective
potential of new therapies is assessed by several variations of
experimentally-induced ischemia but these tend to be transient
focal cerebral ischemia models. Because the majority of strokes do
not resolve with immediate reperfusion, it is vital that potential
therapeutic compounds are studied using a permanent occlusion
animal model as well.
This study was prompted by our earlier findings demonstrating
that omega-3 essential fatty acids (found in fish oil) and human
serum albumin (Alb) are beneficial in ameliorating cerebral
ischemic injury in rodent stroke models [1,2]. Docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA; 22:6, n-3), an omega-3 essential fatty acid provided in
the diet, is concentrated and avidly retained in membrane
phospholipids of the central nervous system. Recently, we have
shown that DHA therapy at low and medium doses improves
outcomes following focal cerebral ischemia [3]. DHA administration
results in neurobehavioral recovery, reduces brain infarction
and brain edema, activates DHA-derived neuroprotectin D1
(NPD1) synthesis in the penumbra, and promotes cell survival
when administered up to 5 h after focal cerebral ischemia in rats
[1,4].
Preclinical studies have established that administration of Alb at
high doses decreases infarct volume, reduces brain swelling [5,6]
and improves local cerebral perfusion in affected tissue [7] when
administered up to 4 h after focal cerebral ischemia in rats [2].
However, administration of high-dose Alb expands intravascular
volume which may lead to pulmonary edema and congestive heart
failure in patients [8]. We suspected that if DHA were complexed
with Alb, it might be possible to achieve neuroprotection at lower,
more clinically achievable doses. Recently, we reported that the
DHA-Alb complex affords high-grade neuroprotection in transient

focal cerebral ischemia at moderate doses [9,10], but whether a
similar effect occurs in permanent MCAo is unknown.
Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
The present study was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Louisiana State University Health
Sciences Center, New Orleans. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
(Charles River Lab., Wilmington, MA) weighing 279–340 g were
fasted overnight but allowed free access to water. Anesthesia was
induced with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and
30% oxygen. All rats were orally intubated, mechanically
ventilated, and femoral arterial and venous catheters were inserted
for blood sampling and drug infusion. Body and cranial (left
temporalis muscle) temperatures were monitored and held at
normothermic levels (36–37uC) during surgical procedures.
Arterial blood gases, pH, plasma glucose, hematocrit, and mean
arterial blood pressure were measured 15 min before, 15 min after
MCAo and 15 min after treatment (3 h 15 min after onset of
MCAo).
Middle Cerebral Artery occlusion (MCAo)
The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was permanently
occluded by an intraluminal filament, as we previously described
[11]. In brief, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed
through a midline neck incision and dissected free of the
surrounding nerves. The occipital branches of the external carotid
artery (ECA) were coagulated, and the pterygopalatine artery was
ligated. A 4-cm length of 3-0 monofilament nylon suture coated
with poly-L-lysine was inserted via the proximal ECA into the
internal carotid artery and MCA until mild resistance was felt.
Following suture placement, the neck incision was closed. Animals
then were allowed to awaken from anesthesia and were tested
using a standardized neurobehavioral battery. The animals were
allowed to survive for 3 days with free access to food and water.
Behavioral Tests
Behavioral tests were performed by an observer blinded to the
treatment groups at 60 min after MCAo onset and then on days 1,
2 and 3. The battery consisted of two tests that have been used
previously to evaluate various aspects of neurologic function: (1)
the postural reflex test to examine upper body posture while the
animal is suspended by the tail, and (2) the forelimb placing test to
examine sensorimotor integration in forelimb placing responses to
visual, tactile and proprioceptive stimuli. Neurological function
was graded on a scale of 0–12 (normal score = 0, maximal
score = 12), as previously described [11]. Only those animals with
a high-grade neurological deficit (10 or greater) were used. In our
experience, virtually every rat has a neurological deficit of at least
10 at 60 min after MCAo onset.
Preparation of DHA–Alb Complex
Docosahexaenoic acid in acid form (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI) was physically complexed to human albumin by
incubating 20 ml of human serum albumin (25%; Baxter,
Westlake Village, CA) with 5 mg DHA/g albumin (molar
ratio = 0.2) in a shaking incubator at 4uC for 30 minutes with
vortex mixing every 5 minutes, as we previously described [9].
Aliquots were extracted, and free fatty acids (FFA) were isolated by
thin-layer chromatography, derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters,
and analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. Each vial was
aliquoted in 5-mL samples and kept under nitrogen in a cold
room; vials were gassed with nitrogen every week. The DHA–Alb
complex contained 2.160.1 mmol DHA per milliliter of albumin
and was stable for at least 2 months.
Experimental Groups
Animals were randomly assigned to six treatment groups: DHA
(5 mg/kg), Alb (0.63 or 1.25 g/kg), DHA-Alb (5 mg/kg+0.63 g/
kg or 5 mg/kg+1.25 g/kg) or saline. Treatment was administered
i.v. 3 h after stroke onset (n = 7–10 per group) by an investigator
blinded to the experimental groups.
Ex vivo MRI Data Collection and Analysis
High resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data
were acquired from 4% paraformaldehyde fixed brains (day 3)
using an 11.7 T Bruker Advance 8.9 cm horizontal bore
instrument equipped with a 89 mm (ID) receiver coil (Bruker
Biospin, Billerica, MA). High-resolution T2 weighted images
(T2WI) were acquired with the following parameters: repetition
time/echo time (TR/TE) = 3278.3/20 msec, 2566256 matrix,
0.75 mm slice thickness, 0.75 mm interleaved, with 2 averages,
number of slices = 25; and field of view (FOV) = 2.0 cm for a total
imaging time of 28 min. We have previously reported no
volumetric differences between in vivo and ex vivo MRI infarct
assessment [12]. Volumetric analyses of the total brain volume and
percent lesion/brain volume were performed on T2WI using
Cheshire image processing software (Hayden Image Processing
Group, Waltham, MA) and Amira (Mercury Computer Systems,
Visage Imaging, Inc., San Diego, CA). T2WI-derived lesion
volumes were measured for all cortical and subcortical brain
regions.
Histopathology
After completion of ex vivo MRI studies, ten-micron-thick
sections were cut in the coronal plane and stained with thionine
(Nissl). Sections were digitized at nine standardized coronal levels
and cortical and subcortical infarct areas were measured and
analyzed using MCIDTM Core imaging software (Linton, Cambridge
, UK) as previously described [11]. An investigator blinded
to the experimental groups outlined the zones of infarction (which
were clearly demarcated) as well as the left and right hemispheres
of each section. Infarct volume was calculated as the integrated
product of cross-sectional area and intersection distance and
corrected for brain swelling.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean values6 SEM. Repeated measure
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni procedures
were used for multiple comparisons. Two-tailed Student’s t tests
were used for two-group comparisons. Differences at P,0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Physiological Variables
Rectal and cranial temperatures, blood pressure, plasma glucose
and blood gases in all animals of this study showed no significant
differences between groups (Table 1). Alb and DHA-Alb therapy
led to the expected moderate reduction in hematocrit compared to
the vehicle groups (Table 1). There were no adverse side effects
observed after treatment in all groups.
Neurobehavioral Assessment
Prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion, neurological score was
normal (score = 0) in all animals. High-grade behavioral deficits

(score = 10–11) were present in all animals when tested at 60 min
after MCAo (Fig. 1A); thus, no animals required exclusion on the
basis of an inadequate degree of cerebral ischemia. Saline (n = 10)-
and Alb-treated rats (n = 10 in both treated groups) developed
severe neurological deficits and showed no differences in
behavioral deficits throughout the 3-day survival period. In
contrast, rats treated with low and moderate doses of DHA-Alb
(n = 10 in both groups) showed improved neurological scores
compared to Alb on days 2 and 3 (Fig. 1A).
T2WI-derived Lesion Volumes
T2WI revealed large lesions involving cortical and subcortical
areas of the brain in saline (n = 9)- and Alb-treated animals
(Fig. 2A). Rats treated with DHA (n = 7) and DHA-Alb (0.63 g/kg;
n = 10) had smaller lesion volumes in the cortex and subcortical
areas. In contrast, a moderate dose of the DHA-Alb (1.25 g/kg;
n = 8) reduced lesion volume, which was mostly localized to the
subcortex and a small portion of the cortex (Fig. 2A). Cortical and
subcortical lesion volumes computed from T2WI images were
reduced by a moderate dose of DHA-Alb compared to Alb-treated
group (cortex: 202626 vs. 25969mm 3 and subcortex: 5269 vs.

8066mm 3, respectively). Total lesion volume, computed from
T2WI was significantly reduced by treatment with DHA-Alb
(1.25 g/kg) compared to the corresponding Alb-treated group
(Fig. 2B). DHA treatment reduced total lesion volume compared
to the saline group (Fig. 2B).
Histopathology
Brains of saline (n = 9) and both Alb-treated rats (n = 10 in each
group) exhibited a consistent pannecrotic lesion involving both
cortical and subcortical (mainly striatal) regions of the right
hemisphere, characterized microscopically by destruction of
neuronal, glial, and vascular elements (Fig. 3). In contrast, infarct
size was reduced in rats treated with a moderate dose of DHA-Alb
(Fig. 3). Cortical, subcortical and total infarct areas were
significantly smaller in both DHA-Alb groups (n = 10 in both
groups) compared to saline and corresponding Alb groups
(Figs. 4A, C, E). The total corrected infarct, cortical and
subcortical infarct volumes were reduced by lower (by 36–40%)
and moderate doses (by 34–42%) of DHA-Alb compared to the
Alb groups (Figs. 4B, D, F). Six animals died during the
experiment: two rats in the saline group (died on days 1 and 2),
one rat in the DHA group (died on day 1), two rats in the Alb
(0.63 g/kg) group (died on days 1 and 2) and one rat in the Alb
(1.25 g/kg) group (died on day 1). DHA-Alb therapy led to 100%
survival rate after permanent MCAo. No animals died in any
DHA-Alb treated groups.
Discussion
The goal of our study was to determine whether acute DHAAlb
administration was efficacious in protecting the brain after a
permanent focal ischemic insult. Our results clearly indicate that
DHA-Alb therapy substantially improves neurological function
and reduces T2WI lesion and infarct volumes in rats after
permanent MCAo.
Recent research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids found in
fish may reduce risk of stroke and coronary heart disease [13].
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), a member of omega-3
essential fatty acid family, is a major component of brain
membrane phospholipids [14]. It is necessary for ion channels,
receptors, and transporters to maintain their proper physical
conformation and is involved in memory, synaptic membrane
biogenesis and functions, and neuroprotection [14]. After ischemic
stroke, free DHA is released from cell membranes and enzymatically
converted into a variety of bioactive lipid mediators, many of
which have neuroprotective activity. After large or multiple brain
injuries, decreases in the stores of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids may potentially result in clinically significant deficits in the
brain’s capacity to prevent and recover from injury. Depletion of
brain DHA results in extensive loss of sensory, behavioral, and
cognitive function both in animals and humans [15]. Recently, we
have demonstrated that DHA therapy at low and medium doses
improves behavioral outcomes and reduces brain infarction
following 2 h of transient MCAo [3]. DHA administration
facilitated neurobehavioral recovery and histological protection
even when treatment was delayed by up to 5 h post-insult [1]. In
addition to DHA, some novel DHA derivatives, such as
neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), have been associated with reduced
inflammation and activation of antiapoptotic pathways, two main
mechanisms of injury implicated in ischemic stroke [16,17].
Our previous studies show that high doses of human serum
albumin are highly neuroprotective when administered intravenously
within a therapeutic window extending up to 4 h after
onset of MCAo [2]. Treatment with albumin improves behavior,
reduces brain infarction and swelling [5,6], improves local cerebral
blood flow [7] and reduces blood-brain barrier permeability [18].
On the other hand, administration of high-dose Alb causes
expansion of intravascular volume and may lead to pulmonary
edema and congestive heart failure in certain high risk patients [8].

We predicted that if DHA were complexed with Alb, it might be
possible to achieve neuroprotection at lower, more clinicallyfeasible
doses and extend the therapeutic window after experimental
stroke. Recently, we reported that the DHA-Alb
complexed at moderate doses (0.63 and 1.25 g/kg) affords highgrade
neuroprotection in transient focal cerebral ischemia,
equaling or exceeding that afforded by native Alb or DHA alone
[9]. Thus, we used these doses in the present study of permanent
focal cerebral ischemia. Administration of DHA-Alb extended the
therapeutic window to 7 h after stroke onset [10]. In addition,
DHA-Alb treatment decreased ED-1-positive microglia cells in the
penumbra and increased NeuN positive neurons, GFAP positive
astrocytes and SMI-71 positive vessels in the ischemic penumbra
and core [10]. To date, no study has examined the effect of DHAAlb
on permanent MCAo. Our current study demonstrated that
the DHA-Alb complex afforded high-grade neuroprotection,
equaling or exceeding that provided by native albumin, and
produces no observable adverse effects in young-adult experimental
animals.
Omega-3 fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and
appear to be important for cognitive and behavioral function.
Recent studies reported improvements in cognitive functions
following DHA or dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in
elderly people with age-related cognitive decline and also reported
a lowered risk of stroke and incidents of dementia [19,20]. Animal
studies demonstrated that fish oil treatment was able to improve
behavioral function and reduce brain infarction in rats subjected
to global [21] and focal cerebral ischemia [1]. In our study,
administration of two different doses of DHA-Alb at 3 h after the
onset of stroke improved the behavioral score when compared to
corresponding Alb-treated groups. Neurobehavioral improvement
was detected at 48 h after onset of stroke and exceeded that of
native Alb throughout the 3-day survival period.
This is the first report demonstrating neuroprotection by DHAAlb
in the setting of permanent MCAo. Models resulting in
permanent ischemia mimic clinical stroke without reperfusion.
However, because of greater mortality with permanent occlusion
models, most preclinical studies use transient MCAo. During
preclinical investigations, it is vital that the potential for new
therapies to ameliorate the consequences of clinically significant
permanent occlusions are assessed in an animal model. Two doses
of Alb (1.25 and 2.5 g/kg) were studied previously in the setting of
permanent MCAo [22]. Only higher-dose Alb therapy (2.5 g/kg)
significantly improved the neurological score and reduced total
infarct volume (by 32%) at 24 h compared to vehicle rats, when
administered at 2 h after onset of stroke. However, administration
of high-dose Alb may lead to development of pulmonary edema in
13% of patients [8]. We suspected that if DHA were complexed

with mostly subcortical involvement. Panel B: Total lesion volumes were

with Alb, it might be possible to achieve neuroprotection at lower,
more clinically achievable doses. In the current protocol, we used
moderate doses of DHA-Alb, administered treatment at 3 h and
extended survival period to 3 days after stroke. Our study
demonstrates that a moderate dose of DHA-Alb (1.25 g/kg)
reduced total, cortical and subcortical lesion volumes computed
from T2WI images by 25%, 22%, and 34%, respectively,
compared to the Alb groups at 3 days after stroke. In addition,
histological evaluation of the brains confirmed that total corrected,
cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were reduced by lower (by
36–40%) and moderate doses (by 34–42%) of DHA-Alb treatment
when compared to the corresponding Alb groups.
The mechanism by which DHA-Alb provides neuroprotection
is not completely understood. Previous studies have established
that Alb is actively involved in plasma transport of FFA [23].
Because transient MCAo triggers a massive loss of phospholipidacyl
groups [24], the systemic supply of FFA to the brain, mainly
arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA, may be essential to support the
repair of neuronal membranes [25]. We recently demonstrated
that Alb contributes to the systemic mobilization of all FFA,
including the essential fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and
linolenic acid (18:3n-3), precursors of AA and DHA, respectively
[26]. In addition, FFA carried by Alb may also be used as an
alternative source of energy. In brain regions susceptible to
transient cerebral ischemic damage, the mitochondrial generation
of ATP is impaired due to a reperfusion-dependent sustained
reduction of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity [27]. The
neuronal beta-oxidation of FFA supplied by Alb may be an
alternative source of acetyl-CoA, thus bypassing the deficient PDH
pathway. This would contribute to restoring oxidative energy
metabolism and the efficient ATP production necessary for the
rapid recovery from a cerebral ischemic insult. Finally, MCAo
selectively activates the mobilization of omega-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids by Alb, thus supporting the neuronal demands of DHA
to repair and rebuild synaptic connections damaged by ischemic
insult [26].
In summary, this is the first report demonstrating the
neuroprotection of DHA-Alb on permanent focal cerebral
ischemia. The present data shows that treatment with DHA-Alb
complex results in high-grade neuroprotection, equaling or
exceeding that afforded by native albumin, and produced no
observable adverse effects in young-adult experimental animals. It
improves behavioral scores and reduces total lesion volumes
computed from T2WI and infarct volumes, even when treatment
is delayed up to 3 h after onset of stroke. These results are
encouraging and provide an additional rationale to move forward
with clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of DHA-Alb in the
treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
