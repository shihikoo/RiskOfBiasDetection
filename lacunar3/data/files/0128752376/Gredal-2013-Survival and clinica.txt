The objectives of the present study were to investigate survival time, possible predictors of survival and
clinical outcome in dogs with ischaemic stroke. A retrospective study of dogs with a previous diagnosis of
ischaemic stroke diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The association
between survival and the hypothesised risk factors was examined using univariable exact logistic regression.
Survival was examined using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression.
Twenty-two dogs were identified. Five dogs (23%) died within the first 30 days of the stroke event.
Median survival in 30-day survivors was 505 days. Four dogs (18%) were still alive by the end of the
study. Right-sided lesions posed a significantly increased risk of mortality with a median survival time
in dogs with right-sided lesions of 24 days vs. 602 days in dogs with left sided lesions (P= 0.006). Clinical
outcome was considered excellent in seven of 17 (41%) 30-day survivors. Another seven 30-day survivors
experienced new acute neurological signs within 6–17 months of the initial stroke event; in two of those
cases a new ischaemic stroke was confirmed by MRI. In conclusion, dogs with ischaemic stroke have a fair
to good prognosis in terms of survival and clinical outcome. However, owners should be informed of the
risk of acute death within 30 days and of the possibility of new neurological events in survivors. Mortality
was increased in dogs with right-sided lesions in this study.

Introduction
Stroke is increasingly identified as the underlying cause of acute
neurological disease in dogs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or computed tomography (CT) (Garosi et al., 2006; Garosi and
McConnell, 2005; Paul et al., 2010; Wessmann et al., 2009). A
stroke can be caused by either a haemorrhage in the brain, i.e.
haemorrhagic stroke, or by thromboembolic occlusion of a cerebral
artery causing ischaemic stroke (World Health Organization,
2006). In dogs, the majority of strokes appear to be ischaemic
(Wessmann et al., 2009). This is similar to humans in whom
approximately 77% of all strokes are ischaemic (Sacco et al., 1998).
The typical clinical picture in dogs with ischaemic stroke is
characterised by acute neurological deficits, varying according to
the site and the extension of the lesion (Garosi et al., 2005, 2006;
Garosi and McConnell, 2005; Goncalves et al., 2011; Wessmann
et al., 2009). Neurological signs include altered mentation, seizures
, hemi- or tetra-paresis, circling, cranial nerve deficits, and
vestibular signs (Garosi et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 1988; Wessmann
et al., 2009). Deterioration can be seen within the first 24 h of the
insult due to progressive oedema, but should generally not be expected
beyond this time frame (Platt and Garosi, 2003; Wessmann
et al., 2009).
The overall prognosis in dogs with ischaemic stroke has been
reported as fair to good if no underlying disease is present (Garosi
et al., 2005; Garosi and McConnell, 2005; Wessmann et al., 2009).
However, no statistical analyses of survival have been published to
document outcome in dogs with stroke.
In human survival studies, the mortality of ischaemic stroke is
estimated at 10–17% at 30 days post-stroke and 15–29% at 1 year
post-stroke (de Jong et al., 2003; Vernino et al., 2003). Several possible
predictors of survival have been investigated, and short-term
as well as long-term mortality have been shown to be significantly
higher with increasing age (Collins et al., 2003; Goldstein et al.,
2001). Patients with post-stroke seizures might also have a higher
mortality (Burneo et al., 2010). Furthermore, the presence of concurrent
medical conditions, in particular cardiovascular diseases,
pose a significantly increased risk of mortality in the long-term
(Bronnum-Hansen et al., 2001; Collins et al., 2003; de Jong et al.,
2003; Hankey, 2003). Clinical outcome in terms of post-stroke neurological
deficits and functional abilities can depend on infarct volume
and the location of the lesion (Hofmeijer et al., 2008; Saunders
et al., 1995; Schiemanck et al., 2006).

A well-known complication among human survivors of a first
stroke is the risk of recurrent stroke, which is seen in 15–30% of patients
within 5 years (Burn et al., 1994; Elkind, 2009; Hankey et al.,
1998). Mortality in these patients has been shown to be higher
than with a first stroke (Elkind, 2009).
The aim of the present study was to investigate survival in a cohort
of dogs with ischaemic stroke and to test selected risk factors
known to influence survival and clinical outcome in humans.
Materials and methods
Study design
The study was designed as a retrospective study with long-term follow-up.
Medical records of neurological referrals presenting at ChesterGates Referral Hospital
, Chester, UK, between 2004 and 2006 were reviewed to identify dogs with a
diagnosis of ischaemic stroke confirmed on MRI.
Inclusion criteria
Dogs with acute onset neurological signs that were non-progressive beyond the
first 24 h and with an MRI (Esaote VetMR, 0.2 T) examination of the brain performed
within 2 weeks of the onset of clinical signs were eligible for inclusion in
the study. Dogs were included if MRI revealed changes characteristic of ischaemic
stroke, i.e. lesions confined to a known arterial territory that appeared iso- or
hypo-intense on T1-weighted images (T1-WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted
images (T2-WI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), showing only minimal
contrast enhancement (McConnell et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 1996). All MRI
recordings were evaluated by the first author (HG), a board certified specialist in
veterinary neurology (GS) and a specialist in human neuroradiology (PG).
Exclusion criteria
Dogs were excluded from the study if survival information could not be
obtained.
Data collection
Medical records of all included dogs were reviewed and the following information
was recorded: signalment, time of stroke event, findings on MRI examinations,
acute neurological signs and known co-morbidities possibly predisposing to ischaemic
stroke. Follow-up data were obtained from the hospital medical records and
from telephone interviews with the referring veterinary surgeons and/or the owners
in May 2008. This included information on clinical outcome, possible recurring
neurological signs and date of death if deceased. Clinical outcome was defined as
excellent if full or nearly full recovery had been achieved. Clinical outcome was recorded
as poor if the dog had died as a result of the stroke, had experienced severe
disabilities, or if new neurological signs had occurred within the follow-up time. In
non-survivors the cause of death was recorded.
Categorisation of infarcts
All MRI images of the acute event were reviewed and the side of brain infarction
(i.e. left or right) was recorded, as well as the affected arterial territory i.e. rostral
cerebral artery (RCA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), caudal cerebral artery (CCA),
rostral or caudal cerebellar arteries.
The size of an infarct was measured on T2-WI transverse sections and described
by the width and the height of the infarct, respectively. A one-dimensional measure
of the width of the infarct (W
ratio
) was estimated as a ratio of the maximum width
(W
inf
) of the hyperintensity divided by the total width (W
tot
) of the brain at the
same level (using DICOM viewer open source OsiriX1). A one-dimensional measure
of the height of the infarct (H
ratio
) was estimated as a ratio of the maximum height
(H
inf
) of the hyperintensity divided by the total height (H
tot
) of the brain at the same
level.
Statistical analysis
Initial descriptive analyses included summary statistics of the individual risk
factors, as well as pairwise comparisons to assess possible confounding between
risk factors. The primary concern was the chance occurrence of an imbalance in
the groups. However, the small sample size did not permit multivariable analyses,
thus the effect of confounding could not be assessed using the odds ratio.
The association between 30-day survival (i.e. the dog being dead or alive at day
30 post-stroke) and the risk factors under investigation were examined using univariable
exact logistic regression in order to account for the sparse data (i.e. small
sample size; Cox, 1970). The analyses were carried out using PROC LOGISTIC in
SAS (2004). The following variables – age at the stroke insult, gender, bodyweight,
side (of the brain), size of infarct (W
ratio
andH
ratio
) and seizures were investigated as
possible predictors of survival. Bodyweight was described as a dichotomous variable
describing small (615 kg) or large (>15 kg) dogs.
The general survival of dogs post-stroke, grouped by the qualitative risk factors,
were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier to compute the non-parametric estimates of
survival, expressed using the survivor function.
SðtÞ¼ PðT> tÞ
where T is the lifetime of a randomly selected dog (Dohoo et al., 2009). The survival
curves for different groups for qualitative risk factors were compared using the logrank
test, by PROC LIFETEST (SAS 9.1, SAS Institute).
Furthermore, a semi-parametric multivariable model using the quantitative and
all statistically significant qualitative risk factors was specified using a Cox proportional
hazards regression model (Cox, 1972; Dohoo et al., 2009) reduced by backwards
elimination of factors above the 5% significance level, using PROC PHREG
in SAS (2004). The assumption of proportional hazard functions when using Cox
proportional hazard models was evaluated by visual inspection (of curves being
parallel) of log(log(S(t)) vs. log(S(t)) plots.
End points
Dogs were considered to have reached the end point of the study if they had
died within the follow-up time. They were right-censored from the study if they
were still alive by the end of the study period (May 2008), or if they had been withdrawn
from the study, either because the owner did not wish to participate or could
not be reached when contacted by telephone.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Twenty-two dogs met the criteria for inclusion (15 males, 7 females
) with a median age at stroke of 9 years (range 2–17 years).
All dogs presented with one or more acute non-progressive neurological
signs including seizures (n= 13), hemiparesis or tetraparesis
(n= 13), ataxia (n= 7), circling (n= 3), mental changes (n= 6),
and/or visual deficits (n= 3).
MRIs were performed between 1 and 12 days after the clinical
onset (median 3 days). Based on MRI, 15 dogs were diagnosed with
an infarct in the territory supplied by the middle cerebral artery or
its branches (all cortical; Fig. 1), one with a thalamic infarct, three
with a rostral cerebral artery infarct, two with a rostral cerebellar
artery infarct (Fig. 2) and one with a caudal cerebellar artery
infarct.
Concurrent medical conditions that could have predisposed to
ischaemic stroke were known in four dogs and included previously
unidentified cardiovascular conditions (n= 2; one with mitral
valve disease and hypertension, and one with a grade 1–2/6 heart
murmur caused by mild aortic and pulmonic regurgitation); neoplasia
(recrudescent caudal fossa meningioma after previous surgery
; n= 1); and hyperadrenocorticism (n= 1). Due to the
heterogeneity of these diseases, this variable was not considered
appropriate for risk analysis.
Information on survival was obtained from medical records and
from additional telephone interviews with the owners (n= 12) and
the referring veterinary surgeon (n= 3). In seven cases, data were
collected from the medical records only. The follow-up investigation
was performed between 30 and 54 months after the initial
stroke episode.
Five dogs died within 30 days of the stroke (median 9 days).
Thirteen 30-day survivors died before the end of the study (median
survival 505 days)-seven were euthanased due to new acute neurological
signs, one was euthanased because of liver disease and
one because of arthritis. In three dogs the cause of death was not
known. Four dogs were still alive by the end of the study. 1 See: www.osirix-viewer.com.

Predictors of survival at 30 days post-stroke
The variables age, gender, bodyweight, side, and size of infarct
and seizures were investigated as possible predictors of survival
at 30 days post-stroke (Table 1). Only the side of lesion was found
statistically significant at the 5% level. Odds of survival at 30 days
were 16.5-fold higher for dogs with a left-sided lesion (13/13) than
dogs with a right-sided lesion (4/9; P= 0.002).
Predictors of long-term survival
Kaplan–Meier analysis found a strong association between survival
and side of lesion (P= 0.006). The final Cox regression model
gave a hazard ratio of 3.9 (95% CI 1.4,11; P= 0.0108) for right side
vs. left, suggesting that dogs with right side lesions were 3.9 times
more likely to die during a given time period than dogs with left
side lesions. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves for left and right

an acute infarct in the area of the right middle cerebral artery.

an acute infarct of the right rostral cerebellar artery.

time was 602 days, whereas for right side lesions it was
24 days.
Clinical outcome
Long-term clinical outcome was considered excellent in seven
cases and poor in 12 cases, as five dogs died within 30 days and seven
experienced new acute neurological signs within the time of
follow-up. In three cases, detailed information on recovery was
not available. These dogs survived 7, 19 and 32 months,
respectively.
In dogs with excellent outcome, marked improvement was generally
observed within the first month with recovery or nearly full
recovery of motor function within 1–3 months post-stroke, as described
by the owners. A subtle change in behaviour, interpreted
by the owners as a lack of confidence, was described in two dogs
as a more permanent sign.
Sudden recurrent neurological signs were described in seven
cases – one with sudden incoordination and circling, one with tetraparesis
, one with collapse and paresis, one with acute severe
head tilt and ataxia, and three with new acute seizure episodes
(one in status epilepticus and one with cluster seizures and sudden
behavioural changes). In two cases, MRI was performed revealing
the presence of a new infarct in both. These two dogs presented
7–8 months after the first stroke. One died in status epilepticus
and the other dog, which presented as tetraparetic, was euthanased
at the owner’s request after 3 days of hospitalisation due to
lack of improvement. The remaining five dogs were all euthanased
based on the occurrence of clinical signs that were interpreted as a
possible recurring stroke. Time from the first stroke (confirmed on
MRI) until the second confirmed or suspected stroke event ranged
from 6 to 17 months (mean 9.8 months, median 8 months).
Eleven of seventeen 30-day survivors (65%) presented with seizures
as one of the primary neurological manifestations. Anticonvulsant
therapy was continued in eight dogs. In two of these
dogs, satisfactory seizure control was not achieved. One was
euthanased after 12 months and the other dog experienced new
acute neurological signs (behavioural changes and sudden cluster
seizures) after 8 months and was subsequently euthanased.
Discussion
The present study confirms that dogs with ischaemic stroke
have a fair to good prognosis if they survive the initial stages. Of
the dogs reported here, 23% died within 30 days of the ischaemic
stroke event, whereas survival in 30-day survivors was estimated
at 505 days, and four dogs were still alive by the end of the study.
However, 7/17 dogs that survived 30 days were eventually assessed
to have a poor clinical outcome. These figures might raise
some concerns that should be addressed when discussing longterm
prognosis with the owners of dogs with ischaemic stroke.
All dogs participating in the present study were referral cases
which could bias the findings towards more severe clinical signs,
as dogs with transient neurological signs caused by discrete ischaemic
lesions are less likely to be referred.
Seven dogs were suspected to have recurring strokes based on a
second episode of acute neurological signs. Of these, MRI evidence
for recurring stroke was found in two dogs. Recurrent stroke has
previously been reported in dogs (Garosi et al., 2005; Shores
et al., 1991) and is also a well known complication in human stroke
epidemiology, as 12% of stroke patients experience another stroke
within the first year and 30% within 5 years (Burn et al., 1994;
Hankey et al., 1998; Hankey, 2003). The risk of recurrent stroke
in dogs emphasises the importance of investigations of risk factors
in this species. So far, to the authors’ knowledge, no specific risk
factors have been reported in the published veterinary literature.
In the investigation of possible predictors of survival in this
study, several analyses did not yield statistically significant results.
This lack of statistical significance might be a consequence of the
limited sample size studied, and that further investigation in a larger
cohort is needed. Interestingly however, right-sided infarcts
were identified as a statistically significant negative predictor of
30-day survival. Odds of survival at 30 days were 16-fold higher
with left-sided infarcts than with right-sided infarcts (right cerebral
or cerebellar hemisphere, or right side of the thalamus or
brainstem; P= 0.002). In addition, the mean survival time in dogs
with a right-sided lesion was 24 days vs. 602 days in dogs with a
left-sided lesion. Lateralisation as a possible predictor of outcome
is a subject of ongoing investigation in humans (Algra et al.,
2003; Fink et al., 2008; Mateo et al., 2006; Tokgozoglu et al.,
1999). It has been shown that right-sided MCA lesions can pose a
greater risk of early mortality (Tokgozoglu et al., 1999). An association
between the insular cortex, particularly right insula infarction
, and its possible role in cardiovascular function and sudden
death, has been suggested (Barron et al., 1994; Cheung and
Hachinski, 2000; Naver et al., 1996; Svigelj et al., 1994). However,
other studies report no effect of lateralisation on survival or functional
outcome (Fink et al., 2008; Mateo et al., 2006). Data on lateralisation
and survival in canine stroke are sparse. In a study of
six dogs with striatocapsular brain infarctions (four with rightsided
and two with left-sided lesions), Rossmeisl et al. (2007)
reported the deaths of two dogs within 30 days, both with rightsided
lesions, possibly implying a similar tendency. In the present
study, the dogs dying within 30 days presented with lesions of
either the right MCA (three dogs) or right cerebellar arteries (two
dogs), and therefore a common neurophysiological explanation
cannot be given. The importance of this statistically significant
finding regarding side of the lesion therefore remains unclear,
but one could speculate that right-sided infarcts lead to more severe
neurological deficits and thus an increased risk of euthanasia.
Additionally, for infarcts of the anterior circulation, the difference
in the anatomical origination of left and right common carotid
arteries might possibly play a role in the development of emboli.
Ischaemic lesion volume in MCA infarctions has been shown to
be a strong predictor of post-stroke mortality and functional

outcome in humans (Saunders et al., 1995; Schiemanck et al.,
2006). A similar result was expected in the present study, although
we were aware that simple one-dimensional measurements did
not describe the precise volume of the infarct. The fact that these
predictors did not reach statistical significance might well be a result
of the limited sample size. Furthermore, one variable might
not be able to predict the outcome alone. It is well-known in human
cases that although infarct size seems to be a significant independent
predictor of outcome, a more precise model can be
achieved by including other predictors, such as the clinical severity
of the stroke, as described by National Institutes of Health Stroke
Score (NIHSS) (Johnston et al., 2000, 2002). The anatomical location
of the lesion could also play an important role, as smaller subcortical
and brainstem lesions can possibly cause deficits which are
disproportionate to lesion volume (Tong et al., 1998). Unfortunately
, the limited sample size of the present study did not allow
for a stratification of infarct size based on topography, due to the
skewed distribution of the affected arterial territories.
Increasing age was not identified as a predictor of mortality in
this study, in contrast to human stroke studies (Hankey et al.,
1998; Mateo et al., 2006; Wade et al., 1985). While this association
was expected in the present canine study, results similar to ours
have previously been reported for dogs (Garosi et al., 2005).
The time of post-stroke recovery described by the owners of 30-
days survivors bears great resemblance to that of human stroke, in
which the most rapid phase of clinical recovery occurs in the first
2–4 weeks, but further recovery continues for up to 12 months
after the stroke (Bonita and Beaglehole, 1988; Meschia and Bruno,
1998; Wade et al., 1985). Lack of confidence, as reported by the
owners of some dogs in this study, is also a well-known feature
in humans (Townend et al., 2010).
Seizures were recognized in 13/22 dogs (59%) as part of the
acute clinical signs of stoke. Stroke-related seizures are also recognized
in humans. Although less frequent, they are reported in
approximately 9% of acute stroke patients (Bladin et al., 2000),
and patients with seizures have an increased mortality at both
30 days and 1 year (Burneo et al., 2010; Shinton et al., 1988). In
the present study, seizures were not a significant predictor of survival
(P= 0.61), but dogs with seizures have previously been reported
at increased risk of premature death in a study including
both symptomatic and idiopathic epilepsy (Berendt et al., 2007).
Conclusions
Dogs with ischaemic stroke often present with severe neurological
signs that might prompt their owners to elect euthanasia.
However, as reported in the present study, many dogs have a fair
chance of surviving and recovering well with time and support,
and this should be stressed when advising dog owners during
the acute phase. Importantly, dog owners should be informed that
in a proportion of affected dogs the prognosis is less favourable, as
shown in this study. Owners should also be warned of the risk of
recurrent stroke.
