Intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke and vascular dementia are ageand
hypertension-associated manifestations of human cerebral
small vessel disease (SVD). Cerebral microvessels are formed by
endothelial cells (ECs), which are connected through tight junctions,
adherens junctions, and stabilizing basement membrane structures.
These endothelial connections ensure both vessel stability and
blood–brain barrier (BBB) functions, the latter enabling selective
exchange of ions, bioactive molecules, and cells between the bloodstream
and brain tissue. SrfiECKO mice, permitting conditional EC-
specific depletion of the transcription factor Serum Response Factor
(SRF), suffer from loss of BBB integrity and intracerebral hemorrhaging.
Cerebral microbleeds and larger hemorrhages developed upon
postnatal and adult depletion of either SRF or its cofactors Myocardin
Related Transcription Factor (MRTF-A/-B), revealing essential
requirements of ongoing SRF/MRTF activity for maintenance of cerebral
small vessel integrity. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging
allowed detection, localization, and time-resolved quantification
of BBB permeability and hemorrhage formation in SrfiECKO brains.
At the molecular level, direct and indirect SRF/MRTF target genes,
encoding structural components of tight junctions (Claudins and ZO
proteins), adherens junctions (VE-cadherin,α-Actinin), and the basement
membrane (Collagen IV), were down-regulated upon SRF depletion.
These results identify SRF and its MRTF cofactors as
major transcriptional regulators of EC junctional stability, guaranteeing
physiological functions of the cerebral microvasculature.
We hypothesize that impairments in SRF/MRTF activity contribute
to human SVD pathology.

Stroke causes more than one of every 20 human deaths in the
United States, whereby stroke pathology presents as ischemic
(87%), intracerebral hemorrhagic (10%), or subarachnoid hemorrhagic
(3%) (1). Intracerebral hemorrhage is a component of
human cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), an age- and hypertension-associated
cerebral morbidity with increasing incidence,
occurring in familial and sporadic manifestations (2). Intracerebral
hemorrhage displays lesions of variable volume, including
macro- and microhemorrhages (microbleeds), readily visualized
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3). Microbleeds
are considered indicators of intracerebral hemorrhage risk in
stroke medicine (4).
The cerebral microvasculature is built by endothelial cell
(EC) interactions, involving tight junctions, adherens junctions,
and EC basement membrane structures, thereby forming the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) of capillaries for selective exchange
between the blood and the brain parenchyme (for review, see
refs.2,3,and5).
Serum Response Factor (SRF), a ubiquitously expressed transcription
factor, activates expression of target genes dependent
upon recruitment of one of at least two classes of cofactors, the
Ternary Complex Factors (TCFs) or the Myocardin Related
Transcription Factors (MRTFs) (6–9). Previously, by using
SrfiECKO and Mrtf-a(−/−)Mrtf-biECKO mice, an endothelial role of
murine SRF and its MRTF cofactors was shown for retinal angiogenesis
(10, 11).
The above inducible mouse lines were used to analyze the
cerebral vasculature in detail. Depletion of SRF or MRTF-A/-B
at postnatal days induced cerebral hemorrhages at early postnatal
age. Similarly, adult depletion of SRF caused SrfiECKO animals to
develop symptoms characteristic of SVD associated with cerebral
hemorrhagic stroke. With time, brain hemorrhages increased
progressively in number and were observed in all brain areas. MRI
identified multiple perivascular blood extravasations of variable
size and allowed lesion localization and quantitation. MRI further
indicated vessel leakiness before the formation of blood-borne
hemosiderin deposits. Structural components of tight junctions
, adherens junctions, and the basement membrane were
Significance
Human cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) comprises ageassociated
intracerebral hemorrhages and global cognitive impairment
, including vascular dementia. Human SVD presents
in either familial or sporadic manifestation, involving either
monogenic Mendelian defects or multitrait genetic variants. To
better characterize the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying
SVD, appropriate animal models are needed. The
SrfiECKO mouse model presented here resembles human SVD
pathology with regard to intracerebral hemorrhage formation
and vascular dementia, including variability in onset and progression
of cerebral symptoms. The Serum Response Factor
(SRF)/Myocardin Related Transcription Factor (MRTF) are shown
to regulate the expression of genes, which are essential for
the maintenance of blood–brain barrier function and cerebral
microvessel integrity. These findings suggest impairment of
SRF/MRTF-mediated gene control as a molecular mechanism
contributing to human SVD.

transcriptional control as a regulator of EC junction integrity.
Results
Lethal Brain Hemorrhaging upon Conditional EC-Specific Deletion of
Srf in Postnatal and Adult Mice. Tamoxifen-induced EC-specific deletion
of the Srf gene in SrfiECKO animals elicited behavioral abnormalities
(11) at varying times of onset, including reduced
movement and lowered exploratory behavior after postnatal Srf
deletion (Fig. S1). Mean survival of postnatally deleted animals was
17 d (Fig. 1A), irrespective of sex. Lethal symptoms included
physical deterioration, hemiplegia, and ataxia. Brains dissected at
age postnatal day 17 (P17) from postnatally deleted SrfiECKO animals
revealed multiple bleedings (Fig. 1B). Hemorrhages were
observed as early as P6. All brain areas displayed hemorrhages,
including cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar lobes (Fig. S2).
Bleedings were found only in postnatal brains and in no other
organ investigated (Fig. S3).
When inducing EC-specific deletion of Srf in the adult,
SrfiECKO animals first displayed mild behavioral abnormalities in
distinct initial phases of variable onset. Here, animals presented
with hunched posture, ruffled fur, and long-legged walking motion.
After an intermittent period of symptom-free behavior, animals
entered an acute stage, displaying severe symptoms,
including ataxia, hemiplegia, lethargy, and physical deterioration.
Adult-deleted SrfiECKO animals, but not control animals, showed
reduced survival (Fig. 1C); both female and male animals were
affected equally. Brain paraffin sectioning of affected adult animals
revealed multiple locations of hemorrhage of different volume
(Fig. 1D), likely causing the observed lethality. Microvessel
bleeding occurred primarily in the brain rather than other organs,
which may be explained by preferential expression of SRF in brain
microvessels (12). Electron microscopic analysis of brain hemorrhages
in both postnatally and adult-deleted animals revealed
blood leakage into the surrounding brain tissue (Fig. 1 E and F).
Whereas erythrocytes were confined to the lumen of ECs in
control brains, red blood cells were found in the surrounding
brain parenchyma in SrfiECKO brains (Fig. 1 E and F). Tight
junctions were found in both control and mutant brain vessels
(Fig. 1 E and F).
At sites of hemorrhage in adult animals, vessel luminal content
was released locally into the surrounding brain tissue, as revealed
by tracing of the intraperitoneally applied dye Evans Blue (EB)
(Fig. S4) and by detection of intracardially perfused Sulfo-NHSLC-Biotin
using streptavidin fluorescence (Fig. 2). Luminal content
extravasation was seen in adultSrfiECKObrains at spatially confined
regions, most often in cortex and striatum (compare H&E-stained
tissue sections) (Fig. 1D). High-resolution fluorescence images
revealed both larger-volume hemorrhages (red circles) and
microbleeds (white arrowheads). Kidney, an organ composed of
fenestrated endothelium, served as positive control. No retinal
fluorescence was seen (Fig. 2), congruent with our previous
scanning laser ophthalmoscopy studies demonstrating absence
of vascular dye leakage in SrfiECKO retinae (11). Collectively
, our data clearly reveal a requirement of endothelial SRF
activity in both young and adult mice for maintenance of brain
microvascular integrity.
In Vivo Time-Resolved Detection and Quantitation of Brain Hemorrhages
and BBB Permeability Using MRI. To identify BBB disruption in vivo,
SrfiECKO and control animals were subjected to MRI, using T2-
weighted imaging (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted
imaging (T1WI). Multiple hemorrhages at various brain regions,
not seen in control animals, were detected in adult-deletedSrfiECKO
mice at 24 wk of age (Fig. 3A). To monitor onset and progression
of brain hemorrhage formation during the lifetime of SrfiECKO
mice, experimental animals were deleted for Srf at 6 wk of age and
imaged longitudinally by T2WI every 2 wk from week 8 onward
(normalized time point 1; nTP1) until the age of 24 wk (late time
point; LTP). Clearly, hypointense lesions increased in number and
distributed over entire brains of SrfiECKO mice, which was not
evidenced in controls (Fig. 3 B, Upper). Quantification (Fig. 3C)
shows T2WI lesions to begin after week 12 of age and increase
subsequently in most SrfiECKO mice studied.
Subtracted T1WI measurements of SrfiECKO mice, but not
control animals, revealed the appearance of hyperintense diffuse
lesions occurring in the entire brain (olfactory bulb, cortex,
striatum, pons, and cerebellum) (Fig. 3 B, Lower). These lesions
varied in number between animals and were mostly observed
from week 12 onward (Fig. 3D). Individual lesions detected by
T1WI occasionally disappeared during the course of MRI and—
in some cases—recurred (Fig. 3D).

To quantify general BBB permeability and/or capillary leakage
before and after appearance of T1WI lesions, we measured the
percentage of global signal change elicited by contrast agent
application (Fig. 3 E and F). There were significant differences
in signal change between control and experimental animals at
normalized time points nTP2, nTP3, and nTP4 and a nonsignificant
trend at nTP1. Thus, MRI (both T2WI and T1WI)
proved valuable to detect, localize, and quantify in vivo both
onset and progression of hemorrhagic lesions. Furthermore, the
T1WI study suggests that global changes in BBB permeability
occur even before nTP4, the time point at which lesions were
first identified macroscopically.
Adult Srf iECKOAnimals Recover Transiently from Initial Symptoms and
Succumb Subsequently to Lethal Stroke. Brains of initial-stage animals
revealed multifocal microhemorrhages with extravasation
of erythrocytes (Fig. S5, Center), but no significant infiltration
with macrophages or glial cells or activation of inflammation.
Mild plasma extravasation (arrowheads) was visible by Periodic
Acid Schiff (PAS) reactivity. The lack of Turnbull Blue staining in
initial-stage brains indicated absence of older bleeds. Amyloid
plaque formation—as seen in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (13)—
was not detectable by Kongo Red staining in any of the tested
animals. Furthermore, Nissl staining did not reveal signs of
neuronal degeneration in mildly affected, initial-stage animals.
In contrast, in acute-stage animals, multiple sites of hemorrhage
were associated with inflammation and infiltration of glial
cells, as revealed by H&E staining (Fig. S5, Right). Prominent
PAS-positive plasma extravasations displayed regions of Turnbull
Blue staining (Fig. S5,Right), indicative of hemorrhages having
occurred approximately several days before sample asservation.
Neuronal degeneration was identified by cellular swelling,
cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear chromatin condensation
(karyopyknosis), and loss of Nissl substance (Fig. S5, Right).
SRF Cofactors MRTF, but Not TCF, Are Essential for a Functional
Cerebral Endothelium. To identify SRF cofactors potentially required
by SRF to ensure the integrity of postnatal and adult cerebral
vasculature, we performed knockout studies on all five
genes encoding known SRF cofactors—i.e., MRTFs (Mrtf-a and
Mrtf-b) or TCFs (Elk1, Elk3, and Elk4). Mrtf-a(−/−)Mrtf-biECKO
mice (11) showed hemorrhages of different volume, highly reminiscent
of those displayed by SrfiECKO mice (Fig. S6 A and B),
strongly suggesting that MRTFs are the relevant endothelial SRF
cofactors in vivo to ensure appropriate formation and functioning
of the cerebral endothelium.
We next investigated the constitutive Elk1/Elk4 double-knockout
(14) and Elk3 single-knockout mouse models (15). By analyzing
the cerebral vasculature of both P10 and adult animals, no
hemorrhages were observed inElkknockout mouse brains (Fig. S6
C–F), demonstrating that TCF-type SRF cofactors Elk1, Elk3, and
Elk4 were not required for formation and maintenance of the
cerebral vasculature.
Srf iECKO Cerebral Microvessels Have Impaired Basement Membrane
Structure and Elevated Astrocyte Recruitment. Cerebral microvessel
stability is dependent upon intact endothelial basement membrane
structure and mural cell coverage. Regarding basement membrane
structure, Collagen IV staining intensity was reduced on blood
vessels of SrfiECKO animals (P10) compared with control sections
(Fig. 4A), in agreement with reduced Collagen IV (Col4) RNA
levels in both postnatal and adult SrfiECKO knockout brains (Fig. 5
A and D). Vessel coverage by vascular smooth muscle cells, investigated
by using smooth muscle actin staining, was unchanged
(Fig. 4B). Staining for glial fibrillary protein revealed an accumulation
of activated astrocytes at locations of hemorrhaged blood
vessels in SrfiECKO brains (Fig. 4C). Importantly, no accumulation
of astrocytes was evident near intact blood vessels in SrfiECKO
brains, indicating a specific astrocyte response to signals emanating
from ruptured vessels in SrfiECKO animals.
Reduced EC Junction Components in Srf iECKO Brains.The integrity of
the BBB depends on functional EC-connecting adherens junctions
and tight junctions. We found that VE-Cadherin (Cdh5), a
known SRF target gene encoding the main EC structural component
of adherens junctions, was down-regulated in purified
cerebral ECs from P10 SrfiECKO animals, in close association with
SRF depletion (Fig. S7). Regarding genes encoding tight junction
proteins, Claudin1, 3, 5, and 12, as well as ZO2 and ZO3,
were significantly down-regulated in P10 whole brain tissue on
the RNA level, whereas ZO1 expression was not altered (Fig.
5A). Also, RNA expression of the basement membrane component Col4 was reduced in SrfiECKO whole brain tissue, whereas
plasma lemma vesicle associated protein (Plvap), a marker for
BBB breakdown (16), was significantly increased (Fig. 5A).
Claudin5 protein expression was significantly down-regulated in
adult SrfiECKObrain lysates (Fig. 5 Band C). In acute-phase brain
tissue of adult SrfiECKO animals, RNA levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor a (Vegfa), an indicator of hypoxia, were unchanged
, whereas RNA levels of known SRF targets—namely,
angiogenic receptor genes Vegfr-1 (Flt1) and Vegfr-2 (Kdr)and
Smoothelin-b (Smtn)—were significantly down-regulated. RNA
levels of the cerebral cavernous malformation genesCcm1(Krit1),
Ccm2,andCcm3, as well as Lamininα3( Lama3), were downregulated
(Fig. 5D).
We complemented the above tissue expression studies by
analyses of cultured mouse ECs (mECs) transfected with siRNA
against Srf. Here, we found that Srf and the SRF target genes
β-actin (Actb), Vegfr-1, and Vegfr-2 were significantly down-regulated
, as well as the adherens junction components α-Actinin

(Actn) and Cdh5 and the tight junction component Claudin5
(Fig. 5E). Cofilin (Cfl1) served as negative control, and Stat1was
used as an indicator of the IFN response associated with siRNA
treatment, which was not induced in our experimental setup
(Fig. 5E). Expression of Ccm2 and Ccm3, but not Ccm1, was
dependent on SRF expression (Fig. 5E). α-, β-, and γ-Catenin
(Ctnna, Ctnnb, and Ctnnc, respectively) were unaffected. These
findings suggest that the observed hemorrhages in brains of
SrfiECKOanimals is due—at least in part—to impaired expression
of EC junctional proteins, basement membrane components, or
junction-associated proteins like CCMs, which were previously
associated with stroke in murine and human systems (17).
Together, EC-specific Srf deletion results in multifocal hemorrhages
, likely induced by a general weakening of the BBB due
to transcriptional down-regulation of tight junction, adherens
junction, and basement membrane structural proteins. The Srf
mouse model serves as a genetic platform to study hemorrhagic
stroke in a noninvasive manner—not requiring anesthesia or
surgery—to explore strategies for early diagnoses and therapeutical
treatments of BBB pathologies, including stroke.
Discussion
Human SVD accounts for at least 20% of all ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke (3), with intracerebral hemorrhage and
microbleeds being vascular lesions serving as SVD markers (2, 3,
18). The genetic basis of human SVD-associated intracerebral
hemorrhage is beginning to be understood, with autosomaldominant
single gene disorders being identified for theAPPgene
in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, the COL4A1 gene in COL4A1-
related intracerebral hemorrhage, and the CCM genes in strokeprone
cerebral cavernous malformations (18). In addition, non-
Mendelian risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke associate with
genomic loci encoding the PMF1/SLC25A44, APOE, and COL4A2 genes (18). We demonstrate here that, in mice, independent
null mutations in genes encoding the transcription factors
SRF and MRTF-A/-B, but not Elk1, Elk3, and Elk4, cause lethal
symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke. These symptoms are highly
reminiscent of those observed in human patients suffering from
SVD. We therefore hypothesize that deficiencies in SRF/MRTF
activity may contribute to human intracerebral hemorrhage pathology.
EC-specific Srf deletion in adult mice may serve as an
animal model for cerebral microvascular dysfunction.
MRI has proven highly valuable in clinical human stroke
management (3). Specifically, identification of cerebral microbleeds
by T2*-weighted MRI has been associated with vessel
fragility, blood extravasation, and future risk of primary or recurrent
intracerebral hemorrhage (3, 4). Similarly, in SrfiECKO
animals, MRI analysis using both T2WI and contrast-enhanced
T1WI allowed identification of microbleeds, intracerebral hemorrhages
, and vessel permeability. T2WI allowed the detection
and localization of microbleeds in SrfiECKO animals, presenting
as lesions of hypointense signal produced by superparamagnetic
hemosiderin deposits (3, 19, 20) (Fig. 3B). Progressive temporal
increase in microbleed number was generally observed (Fig. 3C),
as described for human stroke patients (21). T2*-weighted images
or Susceptibility Weighted Images are used clinically to
identify microbleeds and are therefore recommended in future

studies for better quantification of microbleed volumes. Microbleeds
were also identified by Magnevist-enhanced T1WI (Fig.
3B), which revealed dynamic changes in signal over time (Fig.
3D), as also seen in human patients (22). The temporal changes
of T1WI lesions might reflect the progression in behavioral
phenotype of the animals, which displayed an initial mild-symptom
stage and a recovery phase, followed by an acute lethal stage
(Fig. 3 and Fig. S5).
Some T1WI lesions preceded the appearance of corresponding
T2WI lesions at identical locations (Fig. 3B, differential
arrow at nTP3). Such T1WI lesions may therefore indicate ongoing
microbleeding during measurement. Indeed, Magnevist is a gadolinium-based
contrast agent commonly used for detection of a
disrupted BBB and/or abnormal vascularity (23, 24). Therefore,
T1WI lesion distribution and pattern of appearance may reflect
general small-vessel fragility in SrfiECKO animals.
Such general vessel fragility may associate with vascular permeability
in SrfiECKO brains. Indeed, there are significant differences
between control and SrfiECKO animals at nTP2, nTP3, and
nTP4. Even at nTP1, there is a trend for higher percent change in
the SrfiECKO (Fig. 3 E and F). This finding suggests that there is
global increase of either contrast agent stagnancy or BBB permeability
, with the latter allowing extravasation of contrast agent
before and/or during vessel rupture. Global vessel permeability,
as indicated by leakage of the low-molecular-weight MRI tracer
Magnevist, was not revealed by EB or Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin
staining, which only extravasated at localized points of vessel
rupture (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4). This result may be due to these dyes
forming high-molecular-weight complexes with blood components
such as albumin. Together, our MRI data obtained with
SrfiECKO mice mirror human cerebral microbleeding and intracerebral
hemorrhage (19, 22, 25), supporting the intriguing
possibility that SRF deficiency may contribute to human hemorrhagic
stroke pathology.
Human cerebral cavernous malformation associates with hemorrhagic
stroke, in part caused by mutations in CCM genes (26).
Interestingly, Ccm1, Ccm2, and Ccm3 RNA levels were significantly
decreased in brains of adult SrfiECKO animals (Fig. 5D).
However, we note the complete absence of cavernae in SrfiECKO
brains, indicating that SrfiECKO mice do not provide a model of
human cerebral cavernous malformation.
Microbleeds of SrfiECKO mice are similarly found in human
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (4), indicating a shared feature of
vessel fragility. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy, amyloid plaques
of neuronal origin deposited in the vessel wall are believed to
cause this fragility (4, 27). However, no Kongo Red-positive
amyloid plaques were observed in SrfiECKO animals (Fig. S5),
ruling out a common cause for microbleed formation in human
cerebral amyloid angiopathy and SrfiECKO mice.
Vessel hemorrhaging is likely caused by molecular defects in
EC junction structures. First, regarding tight junction components
, Claudins and ZO adapter proteins were down-regulated in
SrfiECKObrains. Murine genes encoding Claudin12 and ZO-2 are
direct SRF/MRTF target genes, as shown for murine fibroblasts
(7). Interestingly,Cld5−/−knockout mice show a size-selective BBB
permeability (28). Second, regarding adherens junction components
, the Cdh5 gene was identified as a direct SRF target gene
(11, 12). In line, mouse embryos lackingCdh5die at embryonic day
9.5 (E9.5) (29), and disruption of Cdh5 in the adult murine vasculature
causes hemorrhaging (29, 30). The adherens junction
component Actn, down-regulated in SRF-deficient mECs (Fig.
5E), may be regulated indirectly by SRF. Third, both tight junctions
and adherens junctions derive mechanical strength by linkage to
cytoskeletal actin microfilaments (5). Actin genes are prototypical
SRF/MRTF target genes (8) and Actb RNA was downregulated
in SRF knockdown mECs (Fig. 5E). Fourth, reduced
levels of basement membrane proteins may cause small vessel
fragility. Indeed, expression of theCol4gene (encoding Collagen
typeIV) was reduced in SrfiECKO P10 brains at RNA (Fig. 5A)
and protein (Fig. 4) level and at RNA level in adult SrfiECKO
brains (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, mutant Col4a1 mice display intracerebral
hemorrhage (31), similar to SrfiECKOanimals. In some
human SVD patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, mutations in
COL4A1 and COL4A2 are found (18, 31), as well as COL4A2
polymorphisms in sporadic intracerebral hemorrhage (32). Thus,
the correlation of intracerebral hemorrhage occurrence and Collagen
IV deficiency is shared between Col4a1(−/−) mice, SrfiECKO
mice, and some human SVD patients.
In conclusion, SrfiECKO and Mrtf-a(−/−)Mrtf-biECKO mice identify
the SRF/MRTF transcriptional control module as an essential
regulator of cerebral microvascular integrity. The entire assembly

of EC junction components—including tight junctions, adherens
junctions, their linked actin cytoskeleton, and the basement
membrane—are built from key structural proteins encoded by
SRF/MRTF target genes. Consistently, SRF/MRTF deficiency in
murine ECs causes small vessel fragility and brain hemorrhage.
Although SrfiECKO mice demonstrate the essential role of SRF/
MRTF in cerebral microvessel stability, SRF/MRTF might fulfill
a similar function in the human brain. Accordingly, some hemorrhagic
stroke-associated human conditions may be caused by
impaired SRF/MRTF activity. Thus, we speculate that the increase
in hemorrhagic incidence associated with increasing age
of mice (33) and human patients (34) might have a common
underlying basis in age-dependent down-regulation of SRF/
MRTF activity, potentially exerted either by epigenetic mechanisms
(35) reducing SRF/MRTF expression or posttranslational
mechanisms impairing SRF/MRTF function (36).
