Abstract
Objective:Tocharacterizeandestablishareproduciblemodelthatdemonstratesdelayedcerebralvasospasmafteraneurysmalsubarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH) in rats, in order to identify the initiating events, pathophysiological changes and potential targets for treatment.
Methods:Twenty-eightmaleSprague-Dawleyrats(250-300g)werearbitrarilyassignedtooneoftwogroups-SAHorsalinecontrol.Rat
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the SAH group (n=15) was induced by double injection of autologous blood, 48 hr apart, into the cisterna magna.
Similarly,normalsaline(n=13)wasinjectedintothecisternamagnaofthesalinecontrolgroup.Ratsweresacrificedondayfiveafterthesecond
blood injection and the brains were preserved for histological analysis. The degree of vasospasm was measured using sections of the basilar
artery,bymeasuringtheinternalluminalcrosssectionalareausingNIHImage-Jsoftware.ThesignificancewastestedusingTukey/Kramer's
statistical analysis.
Results: After analysis of histological sections, basilar artery luminal cross sectional area were smaller in the SAH than in the saline group,
consistent with cerebral vasospasm in the former group. In the SAH group, basilar artery internal area (.056 μm ± 3) were significantly smaller
from vasospasm five days after the second blood injection (seven days after the initial blood injection), compared to the saline control group with
internal area (.069 ± 3; p=0.004). There were no mortalities from cerebral vasospasm.
Conclusion: The rat double SAH model induces a mild, survivable, basilar artery vasospasm that can be used to study the pathophysiological
mechanisms of cerebral vasospasm in a small animal model. A low and acceptable mortality rate is a significant criterion to be satisfied for an
ideal SAH animal model so that the mechanisms of vasospasm can be elucidated 
7, 8
. Further modifications of the model can be made to adjust
for increased severity of vasospasm and neurological exams.

Representative Results
Within the protocols described above, there are several steps that we believe require a better characterization of the model than what has been
previously described in the literature. Here we focus on the steps that are essential in order to achieve a reproducible low mortality cerebral
vasospasmsmallanimalmodelandavoidpotentialpitfallsassociatedwiththismodelifnotdonecorrectly.
1.AutologousBloodDrawfromtheTailArtery:
Careful placement of the angiocatheter in the tail artery is the essential first step in the model. Figure-1 shows the placement of a 26 gauge
catheter in the tail artery of the rat. This represents a good placement with minimal trauma and blood loss. Proper placement of the angiocatheter
can be confirmed by good blood return.
2. Injection of Autologous Blood into the Cisterna Magna:
Deep dissection of the suboccipital region is performed until the atlanto-occipital membrane is visualized as a shiny white membrane (Figure-2).
The cisterna magna is accessed via a puncture through the membrane with a 25-gauge needle. After withdrawal of the needle, pooling of blood
shouldbenoted,toensureasufficientvolumeofautologousbloodstayswithinthesubarachnoidspaceofthecisternamagna.Excessive
pooling of blood on the outside aspect of the atlanto-occipital membrane is undesirable because our model uses relatively low volumes (0.15
ml)ofautologousbloodcomparedtoexistingmodelsandpoolingcouldresultinineffectivevolumesofbloodinthesubarachnoidspace.
Higher volumes of blood frequently resulted in respiratory failure presumably from elevated intracranial pressure and blood products shortly
after injection. The collection of blood around arteries in the subarachnoid space is one of several possible methods to initiate experimental

Discussion
Primates, having a more similar genetic composition and anatomical features to the human, more closely mimic the events of delayed cerebral
vasospasm and can more easily undergo non-invasive imaging (MRI and angiography) to monitor arterial changes, than rodents 
8
.However,
primate models are cost-prohibitive and associated with more complex care and ethical issues, than small animal models. Small animal SAH
models that have been developed previously have focused on three methods of inducing SAH: 1) Endovascular arterial perforation of an
intracranial artery allowing blood to escape into the subarachnoid space and collect around the injured artery; 2) Surgical exposure of an
artery and local autologous clot injection; 3) Direct injection of blood (autologous or donor) into the subarachnoid space 
8
. Every model has
its own merits and disadvantages. For example, the endovascular perforation model most closely mimics the events of an aneurysm rupture
but is associated with a very high mortality rate and early vasospasm, while the surgical approach is artificial and does not mimic the events
of the typical human presentation of aneurysmal SAH. The direct injection model that we describe here does have a lower mortality than the
endovascular perforation model and more closely mimics the human SAH condition than an open surgical model. Though similar models have
beendescribedpreviously,wehadalargelearningcurvewithSAHmodeldevelopmentbecausethepotentialcomplicationsfromthenuancesof

more easily use this reproducible SAH model.
Whileweproposeasimpleandcosteffectivemodeltostudytheeffectsofdelayedvasospasm,itisnotwithoutitslimitations.Duetothe
abilityforratstorapidlyclearbloodfromthesubarachnoidspace,andtheanatomicaldifferencesinthecerebralarteriesthemselves,ratsare
considered a poor model for the study of delayed subarachnoid hemorrhage 
6, 8
.Thereareafewcriticalstepsthatwouldaffecttheoutcome
of the model. The dose of Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail should not exceed 0.1 ml/kg to ensure adequate anesthesia. Any amount of pooling of
blood after injection into the cisterna magna should be noted and documented as we have noted that pooling of blood leads to a lesser degree of
vasospasm 
9, 13, 15
. Other studies have shown that second injections of blood 24 hr apart can induce a more significant degree of vasospasm 
6
,
we believe it would not mimic the time course of vasospasm in humans where vasospasm rarely occurs prior to day three after SAH. In order to
more closely mimic this time course we made the second injection of blood 48 hr after the first injection.
Potential modifications of the model we describe include injecting larger volumes of blood into the subarachnoid space, changing the source of
blood, altering the time course for the second injection, and sacrificing further out than five days after the second blood injection. Such variations
in previous models can be found above in Table2. During the course of our model development, we used both single and double injection
models,alteredthetimebetweeninjectionswiththedoubleSAHmodel,testedvariousvolumesofblood,testedtheeffectsofhemolysedblood,
tried venous versus arterial and autologous versus donor blood injections. Each of these modifications lead to complications that resulted in
an unusable model for testing delayed vasospasm. The model described above consistently produced a low mortality basilar artery SAH small
animal model of delayed cerebral vasospasm (CV) 
6, 7, 11, 13, 15
.
Low mortality rates allow for a more thorough understanding of the entire mechanism of cerebral vasospasm 
13
. Bederson et al.

 have used
theendovascularperforationmodel,reportingamortalityrateof50%within24hrofobservation.Veelken et al.
16
 with their endovascular
filament ICA perforation model described a mortality rate of 100% in the normal perfusion group within 3 hr of the procedure. The endovascular
perforation model performed by Lee et al.
7
 showed a significant degree of vasospasm (BA diameter 230 μm ± 70) compared to the double
hemorrhage model within the same study (BA diameter 320 μm ± 36), and the mortality rate for the perforation model was reported to be 44%.
The fivefold increase in glutamate levels, as well as increases in lactate and free fatty acid concentrations are some of the detrimental metabolic
effectsseenafewminutesafterinductionofSAHthatcontributetotheincreasedmortalityintheperforationmodel
10
.There is enough evidence
to support that the perforation model needs further refinement in order to control the high mortality rates.
Themortalityratesusingthedouble-SAHmodelvarywidelydependingonthevolumeofbloodinjectedandtherateofinjection.Wefound
that larger volumes of blood and faster injection rates, all lead to respiratory arrest and frequently death during or immediately after the blood
injection.Duringmodeldevelopment,mortalityratesrangedfrom1.5%to47%withbloodvolumebeingthemostimportantfactoraffecting

In the quest for better understanding the underlying pathophysiology of delayed CV in rat models, one can undertake a myriad of future
applications as an extension of our model. The essential goal is the development of agents that could successfully prevent and treat CV in
humans. In order to do so one must understand the complex interactions and multifactorial processes that initiate and sustains CV in humans
17
. With the establishment of a suitable survivable SAH rat model, investigators can focus on the short and long term mechanisms of cerebral
vasospasm and avoid conflicting data typical of secondary ischemic damage in the rat neurons
