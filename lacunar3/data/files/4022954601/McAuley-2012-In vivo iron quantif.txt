Brain microbleeds (BMB) are associated with chronic and
acute cerebrovascular disease. Because BMB present in the
brain is a source of potentially cytotoxic iron proportional to
the volume of extravasated blood, BMB iron content is a
potentially valuable biomarker both to assess tissue risk and
small cerebral vessel health. We recently reported methods to
quantify focal iron sources using phase images that were
tested in phantoms and BMB in postmortem tissue. In this
study, we applied our methods to small hemorrhagic lesions
induced in the in vivo rat brain using bacterial collagenase. As
expected by theory, measurements of geometric features in
phase images correlated with lesion iron content measured
by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Iron
content estimation following BMB in an in vivo rodent model
could shed light on the role and temporal evolution of ironmediated
tissue damage and efficacy of potential treatments
in cerebrovascular diseases associated with BMB. Magn

Brain microbleeds (BMB) are associated with ischemic
and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral amyloid angiopathy,
neurotrauma, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia,
cognitive decline, hypertension, and aging (1–16). The
presence of BMB in ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage
, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy is associated
with future hemorrhage (2,17–19). Whether the presence
of BMB increases the risk of bleeding when thrombolytic
and antithrombotic agents are used is an important
and controversial question (2,17,20,21). Thus, BMB
are associated with chronic and acute illness of
significant clinical importance especially in our aging
population.
BMB are visible in gradient recalled echo T

* magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging as focal regions of signal loss
(22,23) and have been histopathologically related to hemosiderin
(7,24,25), the (paramagnetic) iron–protein
complex associated with pathologic iron storage following
hemorrhage (26) and ferritin breakdown (27). Thus,
BMB represents a source of pathologic iron in the brain
that is potentially cytotoxic (e.g., free radical production
through the Fenton reaction). Oxidative damage, iron
accumulation, and/or changes in iron metabolism have
been implicated in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular
diseases (28–35). In addition, because iron is deposited
at the site of a BMB in proportion to the amount of
extravasated blood, iron content in BMB can be considered
a marker for the severity of underlying vessel disease
(2). Therefore, the quantified iron content in BMB is
potentially informative regarding disease progression
and the efficacy of treatment (2,27,36).
A few studies have compared radiologic BMB with
postmortem human tissue and have noted evidence of
associated tissue damage (7,24,25). However, in vivo animal
studies would allow the investigation of temporal
relationships regarding tissue damage evolution following
BMB and possible interventions. In particular, studies
correlating BMB iron content levels with the severity
and evolution of tissue damage could shed light on the
role of iron in the disease process. In addition, postmortem
formalin fixed tissue contains protein cross-linkages
and can be altered by tissue decomposition (before and
during fixation), fixative-induced tissue damage, and
transition metal leaching (37–39), whereas these are not
present in the living mammalian brain.
We recently proposed methods to quantify focal iron
sources using MR phase images. The methods were
tested in MR phantoms using a hemosiderin mimic (40)
and with actual BMB in postmortem human tissue (41).
In this study, a logical extension of these previous studies
, we apply similar approaches toward iron quantification
in the living rat brain using a collagenase-induced
BMB model.

(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was injected 6.1 mm
below the skull surface using a Hamilton syringe (Reno,
NV) placed in a microsyringe pump (Model 310 Plus Series
, KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) targeting the caudate/
putamen (CP) of the rat brain. A range of collagenase doses
(0.11 U/200 nL saline, 0.14 U/200 nL, 0.15 U/200 nL, 0.16
U/200 nL, 0.17 U/200 nL, 0.18 U/200 nL, 0.2 U/200 nL,
0.22 U/200 nL, and 0.24 U/200 nL saline (where U denotes
enzyme activity units)) were injected over 5 min. To minimize
bleeding of injectate up the needle tract, the needle
was held in place for 20 min following the injections and
then slowly withdrawn at 0.5 mm/min. The burr hole
was filled with bone wax, the scalp sutured shut, and the
rats were allowed to recover. One animal was euthanized
on postoperative day (POD) 2 due to surgical complications
, and nine rats underwent MR scanning.
MR Imaging
Rats were scanned POD 2862 in a 4.7 T small animal MR
scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) using two susceptibility
weighted imaging (SWI) sequences with the following
parameters: (1) 3D coronal SWI: TR/TE: 46.5/25
ms (repetition time/echo time (TR/TE): 39/20 ms for two
rats), flip angle: 17, matrix: 256  256, number of excitations
(NEX): 3, field of view (FOV): 3.0 cm, in-plane resolution
: 117  117 mm, and 32 slices of thickness 0.938
mm. (2) 2D axial SWI: TR/TE: 558.3/25 ms (TR/TE:
1248.8/20 ms for two rats), flip angle: 20, matrix: 256 
256, NEX: 6, FOV: 3.0 cm, in-plane resolution: 117  117
mm, slices: 10, 12, or 32 of thickness 0.8 mm.
Lesion Dissection
Immediately following MR scanning, animals were sacrificed
by exsanguination by way of transcardial perfusion
with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were
extracted from the skull and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
The rat brains were sectioned coronally anterior
and posterior to the needle tract that was visible at the
top of the brain. Additional dissection was performed as
necessary to reveal the anterior/posterior lesion boundaries
and trim away excess tissue. Sections of tissue surrounding
the lesion (ipsilateral CP) and control sections
(contralateral CP) were dissected out of the coronal slices
using a diamond knife and nylon and titanium forceps
(Fig. 1) and weighed on a precision balance.
Iron Content Determination
Samples were wet ashed similar to (41): blocks (20–70
mg) were dissolved in 250 mL of 70% HNO
3
overnight,
heated at 80C for 20 min, and allowed to cool to room
temperature. A total of 250 mL of 10 M of H
2
O
2
were
added and, after 30 min, samples were heated to 70C
for 15 min and allowed to cool. Iron concentrations were
measured in triplicate by graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectrometry (SpectrAA 220Z, Varian, Victoria, Australia
). Assuming that contra- and ipsilateral CP have
comparable background iron concentrations, lesion iron
content was calculated using the formula: m
(Fe)L
¼ f
(Fe)I-

, where m
(Fe)L
is the mass of iron in the
lesion, f
(Fe)I
(f
(Fe)C
) is the w/w Fe concentration of the ipsilateral
(contralateral) tissue block, and m
I
is the mass
of ipsilateral tissue.
Image Processing
3D (2D) raw phase images were high-pass filtered using a
16  32 (32  32) frequency domain filter (42) using SPIN
software (SPIN software, MRI Institute, Detroit, MI). Magnitude
images were multiplied four times by the product
of the negative and positive phase mask of Ref. 43. The
image parameter r0
p
(point where the phase reaches the
value of p along vertical dipole axis) was obtained using
the vertical dimension of rectangles bounding the coronal
phase dipole patterns in the 3D images similar to (41).
However, all gray-scale images were converted to binary
images using ImageJ software National Institute of Health
(NIH) before bounding rectangles were drawn allowing a
more objective determination of r0
p
in one case, where the
location of the vertical phase wrap was ambiguous (Fig.
2). Still, a slight ambiguity remained for case 3 (reflected
in the larger uncertainty for r0
p
in Table 1 (see Appendix
A)). Measured r0
p
values from images acquired with T
E
¼
20 ms were scaled by a factor of 1.08 in accordance with
Eq. 8 of (41). (Note that 2D images are used for lesion visualization
only (Fig. 2).)
Statistical Analysis
The relationship predicted by Eq. 6 of Ref. 41 between
BMB iron mass and r0
p
was tested by linear regression
analysis using SigmaPlot version 11 (Systat Software,
Inc., Chicago, IL). A plot of mass of iron (m
Fe
)1/3 vs. r0
p
was constructed along with a best-fit least squares regression
line. Statistical significance was considered at P <
0.05. Finally, we note that the independent variable in
the regression model is measured with uncertainty. In
general, uncertainty in a predictor variable leads to bias
in the regression parameters (44). However, in this study,
the slope and intercept are free from bias, and coefficient
of determination (R2) is attenuated by <4% (see Appendix
B). We report the attenuated value.

RESULTS
Consistent with right CP lesions, right circling behavior,
left forelimb paresis, and loss of left whisker reflex was
observed in rats in varying degree and duration following
surgery. MR images confirmed the presence of these
lesions in the CP (Fig. 3). Dipole patterns were observed
in SWI phase, filtered phase, phase mask, phaseenhanced
magnitude, and to a lesser extent, magnitude
images. However, when compared with our previous
focal quantification studies (40,41), the dipole patterns
were generally neither as distinct nor as symmetric. The
lesions were generally more spatially distributed and not
spherical, typically elongated in a dorsal–ventral (e.g.,
see Figs. 1 and 3f–i) and rostral–caudal orientations. One
rat was excluded because the lesion dipole pattern was
distorted by background phase and image data from eight
animals were analyzed. Iron mass and image parameter
data for these animals are shown in Table 1. The median
iron mass of the induced BMB was 1.40 mg.
A plot of m
Fe
1/3 vs. r0
p
revealed a statistically significant
linear relationship (attenuated R2 ¼ 0.65, P ¼ 0.012) as
was expected based on the theory underlying the quantification
method (Fig. 4) (41). The slope was found to be
4.4 mg1/3/cm (P ¼ 0.012) and the intercept while predicted
to vanish (41) was statistically different from zero
(0.64 mg1/3, P ¼ 0.005). The effective mass magnetic susceptibility
(Dx/r) of the sample legions was calculated
from the slope (41) and found to be 7.2  106 m3/kg,
about five times larger than reports for human liver ferritin
and hemosiderin (45) and about nine times larger
than reported in our postmortem human study (41).
Finally, using the slope of Fig. 4, d^ mFe
of Eq. 5 was found
to range from 0.01 to 0.04 lg, with a mean of 0.02 lg, a
standard deviation of 0.01 lg, and a median of 0.02 lg.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we tested our focal iron quantification technique
in a simple collagenase-induced BMB model in the

underlying the quantification method. However, the significant
intercept of 0.64 mg1/3 (P ¼ 0.005) is predicted to be zero.

living rat brain. The BMB dimensions were on the order
of 1–2.5 mm in size and contained 0.8–2.4 mg of iron.
Thus, the size and iron content of the BMB were relevant
to human BMB (41). Dipole patterns were present in
experimentally induced bleeds and were measured for the
r0
p
parameter. A plot of the cube root of lesion iron mass
against r0
p
produced a linear graph as expected by the
theory underlying the quantification technique. This can
be thought of as a standard curve whereby other BMB
could be assayed for iron content in the rat brain (40,41).
However, the dipole patterns associated with collagenase
hemorrhages were neither as distinct as previously
observed from BMB in postmortem human brain nor was
the linear correlation relating iron mass and r0
p
as strong (r
¼ 0.81 (attentuated) vs. r ¼ 0.99 in (41)). This is most
likely due to less focal bleeding in this study (Figs. 1 and
3f–i). Although an established intracerebral hemorrhage
rat model typically delivers 0.2 U of collagenase in 1 mL
of saline (46,47), the smaller doses and volumes used in
this study reflect an attempt to induce smaller and more
focal hemorrhagic legions to better model BMB. However,
it appears the collagenase injections caused bleeding that
is more spatially diffuse than is characteristic of real BMB
which generally originate from a single ruptured vessel
(25). Refinements to the BMB induction technique leading
to more concentrated lesions and distinct dipoles are possible.
For example, diffusion of collagenase through the
brain tissue likely contributes to the nonlocality including
dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal elongation of the
induced lesions. The use of a glass micro needle (which
have outer diameters an order of magnitude smaller than
the 26 gauge needle used here) (48) and the associated
smaller bore needle tract could lead to less diffusion of
enzyme away from the injection site and thus more localized
bleeding and iron deposition. On the other hand, an
alternate model that uses ultrashort laser pulses to induce
hemorrhages in targeted single microvessels may offer
superior results compared with a collagenase-induced
BMB model at least for cortical bleeds (49).
Critical to the validation of the quantification technique
is the correlation between BMB iron measured by
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and the
phase image parameter r0
p
. In the living rat brain, lesion
susceptibility varies as red cell breakdown, heme degradation
, and hemosiderin formation evolves (50). Similarly
, in this experiment, the amount of paramagnetic
iron detectible by (or ‘‘visible’’ to) the MR scanner is also
expected to vary with lesion age. As graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrometry always measures the
total iron present in the tissue, perfect correlations can
only occur if the imaging is done when all the iron
extravasated following the BMB is visible. In humans,
hematoidin, a marker of free iron release due to hemeoxygenase
activity, peaks around POD 10, and hemosiderin
deposition peaks around POD 10–14 (51,52), and we
chose POD 28 to image and sacrifice the rats assuming
that hemosiderin formation would be essentially complete.
However, one possible explanation for the unexpected
nonzero intercept in the plot of Fig. 4 is the presence
of non-MR visible iron. A longitudinal study design
with (1) multiple time point extending beyond POD 28,
and (2) with an additional component investigating the
magnetic and biochemical properties of lesion iron and
associated molecules in the tissue, could shed further
light on how lesion iron accumulation, concentration,
magnetic properties, and MR-visibility vary over time.
The nonzero intercept in Fig. 4 suggests that not all iron
is accounted for by r0
p
measurements. Examination of Table
1 and Fig. 4 reveals that the mass of iron associated
with point pairs with similar or equal r0
p
values differ by
0.3–0.6mg. This suggests that the sensitivity of the technique
at this image resolution (40) may also contribute to
the nonzero intercept. However, the largest uncertainty of
predicted iron mass (m
Fe hat
) for our eight cases was found
to be0.04mg, over six times smaller than that implied by
intercept of 0.64mg1/3. Therefore, discreet voxel size alone
may not explain the discrepancy. Besides a contribution
from nonvisible iron discussed earlier, an alternate possibility
is that the singler0
p
parameter only approximates the
iron content of nonspherical lesions. Finally, another
point of interest consequent from Fig. 4 is the difference in
lesion mass susceptibility compared with human liver hemosiderin
and our postmortem study. Whether this results
from differences in species, bleeding mode, artifacts of fixation
on tissue and lesion susceptibility, or other factors is
an important question that calls for further study.
In conclusion, we have shown that an SWI phase
image method can be used to estimate focal iron content
on the order of a few micrograms in the living rodent
brain using simple modifications of an established collagenase
intracerebral hemorrhage model. Improvements to
the experimental technique or the use of alternate bleeding
models are expected to produce superior results and
could further increase the usefulness of the technique in
animal models. This will potentially allow investigation
of the temporal progression of bleeding lesions and the
role of iron-mediated tissue damage and the efficacy of
therapeutic interventions in small cerebral vessel disease
associated with BMB.

The above uncertainties are associated with the measured

uncertainty in the predicted iron mass due to measurement
error in r0

(expressed by Eq. 6) follows from Eq. A3
and Eq. 6 of Ref. 41.
Finally, we noted that the uncertainty in r0

due to
white noise (40) was generally an order of magnitude
lower than that of discreet voxel size in this study and
was thus neglected.
APPENDIX B
Because of the finite voxel size in our experiment, the
true r0

(which we denote as r0

*) is unknown, and we
perform the regression using a surrogate variable—i.e.,

where dr0

of r0

measurements; therefore, Eq. B1 represents
an unbiased Berkson error model (44). In such a model,
the regression coefficients are not biased, but there is an
increase in the residual variance, given by Eq. B2, and a
corresponding decrease inR2 seen in Eq. B3 (44,54):

study, the slope and intercept are free from bias, and the
effect of error on the regression coefficient is small. Finally,
we note that the attenuation depends on the square ofdr0
p
*.
Thus, decreased in-plane resolution and slice thicknesses
result in smaller attenuations (e.g.,dr0
p
*!(0.5)(dr0
p
*) leads
to an attenuation of 0.01 or<2% in the present case).
