Abstract Neurovascular diseases are among the leading
causes of mortality and permanent disability due to stroke,
aneurysm, and other cardiovascular complications. Cerebral
autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and Marfan syndrome are
two neurovascular disorders that affect smooth muscle cells
through accumulation of granule and osmiophilic materials
and defective elastic fiber formations respectively.
Moyamoya disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
(HHT), microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism
type II (MOPD II), and Fabry’s disease are disorders that
affect the endothelium cells of blood vessels through occlusion
or abnormal development. While much research has been
done on mapping out mutations in these diseases, the exact
mechanisms are still largely unknown. This paper briefly introduces
the pathogenesis, genetics, clinical symptoms, and
current methods of treatment of the diseases in the hope that
it can help us better understand the mechanism of these
diseases and work on ways to develop better diagnosis and
treatment.

Introduction
Neurovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality
and permanent disability in both children and adults. In
2010, neurovascular diseases accounted for 5 million deaths
worldwide and caused another 5 million people to be permanently
disabled (Corbyn 2014). Rare, genetically heritable diseases
cause a small fraction of those deaths. Although technical
advances such as genomic sequencing have accelerated the
elucidation of the genetic basis for inherited neurovascular diseases
, mechanisms of the diseases remain largely unknown. In
this review article, we discuss two types of neurovascular disorders
, including those of the endothelial cells and those of
smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Specifically, we will
focus on cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL),
Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease, hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT), microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial
dwarfism type II (MOPD II), and Fabry’s disease.
CADASIL is a hereditary small cerebral artery disease and
is a major risk factor for stroke (Chabriat et al.2009). Marfan
syndrome is a connective-tissue disorder that was first described
by a French pediatrician, Antoine Bernard-Jean
Marfan, in 1896 (Canadas et al. 2010). Moyamoya disease
was first discovered in 1957 by Japanese surgeons and is a
major risk for childhood stroke (Fukui et al.2000). HHT, also
known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a vascular

disorder first described in the 19th century, and was associated
with nosebleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vascular abnormalities
(Krings et al. 2005). MOPD II is the most common
type of primordial dwarfism categorized by Majewski in
1982 and is characterized by an adult stature under one meter,
disproportionate head, microcephaly, and bone dysplasia
(Brancati et al. 2003; Herman et al. 1991; Rauch et al.
2008). Finally, Fabry’s disease, also known as Anderson-
Fabry disease, is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease
(MacDermot et al. 2001).
Extensive genetic mapping and mutational analyses have
been done to determine the mechanisms of these diseases. To
date, mutations in a large number of genes have been reported
in these diseases, such as Notch3, FBN1, ENG, PNCT,and
GALA, but it has been difficult to determine which of the
hundreds of different mutations in these genes are associated
with the diseases or have diagnostic values. Here we review
the latest findings of the diseases for updated information of
the diseases that may help develop better diagnosis and
treatment.
Epidemiology
Prevalence of the six diseases ranges from just a few hundred
of total reported cases to 1 in 5000 people (Canadas et al.
2010; Faivre et al. 2007). Among the six diseases, Marfan
syndrome, Moyamoya disease, HHTand Fabry’s disease have
the highest prevalence, with Moyamoya being predominantly
reported in East Asia and the others found globally. For
CADASIL, there have only been over a couple hundred of
reported cases and the exact prevalence of MOPD II is
unknown.
CADASIL and Marfan disease
CADASIL is a hereditary small cerebral artery disease. Since
2009, it has been reported in over 500 families globally
(Chabriat et al.2009). While this disease is prevalent in many
races, European Caucasian families have the greatest number
of reported cases (Tan et al. 2012). In the UK, the prevalence
is estimated to be 1 in 100,000 people (Markus et al.2002). In
contrast, Marfan disease has a higher prevalence, about 1 in
every 5000–10,000 individuals (Canadas et al. 2010; Faivre
et al. 2007). Marfan syndrome mainly affects the ocular, cardiovascular
, and skeletal systems (Faivre et al. 2007).
Moyamoya and HHT diseases
Moyamoya disease is responsible for one fifth of all cerebral
arteriopathies in childhood stroke (Amlie-Lefond et al.2011).
The disease has the highest prevalence in Japan, 6.03 in 100,
000 (Parray et al. 2011). It affects more females than males,
with a ratio of 1.8:1 (Parray et al. 2011). Similarly, HHT also
has a relatively high prevalence, 1 in 5000–8000 people
(Govani and Shovlin 2009). Unlike Moyamoya disease,
HHT has been reported globally and has a proportionate
amount of affected males and females (Grand’Maison2009).
MOPD II and Fabry’sdisease
Due to the rarity of MOPD II disease, the prevalence is currently
unknown. The prevalence of Fabry’s disease is about 1
in 40,000 and it has been reported in all major races (Galanos
et al.2002). Males, who are hemizygous for the disease, often
develop severe phenotypes. Heterozygous females may have
phenotypes ranging from no symptoms of disease to more
severe phenotypes (Thadhani et al. 2002).
Pathogenesis
There are diverse forms of neurovascular diseases with different
molecular bases of pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of the
two types of diseases that will be focused on are diseases due
to deformations in the endothelium layer and diseases due to
deformations in the smooth muscle layer of blood vessels.
Smooth muscles can be affected by accumulation of proteins
or defects of elastic fibers. Endothelium cells, on the other
hand, can be affected by fibrocellular thickening, development
of fragile vessel walls, and lipid deposition. In general,
malformations usually result in stenosis, structural collapse or
rupture of the endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells.
Neurovascular disease affecting smooth muscle
CADASIL and Marfan syndrome are two diseases that affect
cerebral smooth muscle. In CADASIL, the underlying cause
is due to the accumulation of both Notch3 and granule and
osmiophilic materials (GOM) in vascular smooth muscle
cells. In contrast, Marfan syndrome is due to defective elastic
fibers, which cannot form connections with smooth muscle
cells. In the case of CADSIL, this leads to stenosis of the
arteries surrounded by the smooth muscle, whereas in
Marfan syndrome, it leads to a collapse of vessel walls.
CADASIL disease
CADASIL is an inherited central nervous system (CNS) disorder
caused by mutations within the Notch3 gene. It is the
most common form of hereditary stroke. Notch3 is highly
expressed in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and cells
of the small arteries (Chabriat et al. 2009; Ishiko et al. 2006).
In Notch3 knockout mice, defective arterial smooth muscle
differentiation and maturation was observed (Chabriat et al.
2009). However, CADASIL is not caused by the deletion of

Notch3. Aggregation of Notch3 around VSM cells and
pericytes of blood arteries and capillaries are the underlying
cause of CADASIL (Chabriat et al. 2009; Ishiko et al. 2006).
As a result, VSM cells degenerate and this leads to the stenosis
of distal segment of medullary arteries (Peisker et al. 2013).
There is also an accumulation of GOM in VSM cell membranes
, which further contributes to the disease (Ishiko et al.
2006;Stojanovetal.2014).
Marfan syndrome
Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder involving an
extracellular matrix protein, fibrillin, encoded by the fibrillin-
1 (FBN1) gene (Canadas et al. 2010; Francis et al. 2007).
Fibrillin is an important component of microfibrils, which
form elastic fibers (Canadas et al. 2010). It is believed that
missense mutations in FBN1 have a dominant negative effect
in the assembly of microfibrils (Canadas et al. 2010;Dean
2002; Yuan and Jing 2010). Mutated microfibrils leads to
defective connections between elastic fibers and vascular
smooth muscle cells. As a result, this can cause elastic fiber
calcification, intimal hyperplasia, and inflammation and structural
collapse of vessel walls (Francis et al.2007).FBN1 mutations
have also been reported to be involved in transforming
growth factorβ (TGFβ) signaling (Dietz et al. 2005). TGFβ
signaling pathway is linked to aneurysm progression in
Marfan syndrome (Ramirez and Dietz 2007).
Neurovascular disease affecting the endothelium
The four diseases that affect the endothelium of the cerebral
blood vessels include Moyamoya disease, Hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT), Microcephalic osteodysplastic
primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II), and Fabry’sdisease.
Moyamoya disease and Fabry’s disease are both due to occlusion
of the blood vessels. In Moyamoya disease, it is due to
fibrocellular intimal thickening, while in Fabry’s disease, it is
due to lipid deposition. MOPD II can often lead to brain aneurysms
due to weakening of the vessel walls. In HHT there is
an abnormal development of blood vessels. Despite the differences
in pathogenesis, all four diseases are easily susceptible
to hemorrhaging of blood vessels.
Moyamoya disease and MOPD II symptom
Moyamoya disease is an inherited cerebrovasculopathic disease
that was first described in Japan as a risk factor for childhood
stroke (Amlie-Lefond et al.2011). In the brain, there is a
spontaneous and progressive occlusion of the supraclinoid
internal carotid arteries in the circle of Willis. The occlusion
in the arteries is caused by extensive fibrocellular intimal
thickening, which narrow the walls of the vessel (Janda et al.
2009;Zipfeletal.2005). As a result of the occlusion of the
carotid arteries, formation of arterial collaterals, also known as
moyamoya collaterals, are induced to compensate for the lack
of blood flow to the brain (Scott and Smith2009). Moyamoya
collaterals resemble a puff of smoke on a cerebral angiogram,
hence it’s name (moyamoya translates to puff of smoke in
Japanese) and can be fragile and dilated or have thick walls
and constricted (Zipfel et al. 2005). Cerebral ischemia often
results from vascular stenosis and the fragile collaterals are
susceptible to intracerebral hemorrhages (Zipfel et al. 2005).
Ithas been noted that smooth muscle proliferation may also be
involved in the narrowing of the blood vessels. Moyamoya
disease can often be a result of MOPD II. MOPD II is a
disorder characterized by a variety of symptoms including
intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly,
and abnormal cerebrovascular development (Galasso et al.
2008). Patients also tend to have characteristic facial features
such as having a broad and elevated nose root and prominent
eyes, and abnormal skeletal development (Hall et al. 2004).
Intracranial aneurysms are often manifested in MOPD II
patients (Rauch et al. 2008).
HHT disease
HHT is a dominant hereditary disease characterized by the
abnormal development of blood vessels (Govani and
Shovlin 2009;Grand ’Maison 2009). The hallmark characteristics
of this disease are skin and mucosal telangiectasias and
arteriovenous malformations (Govani and Shovlin 2009;van
den Driesche et al.2003). Telangiectasias result in frail blood
vessel walls, which are easily ruptured and commonly cause
bleeding of the nose, mouth or fingers (Letteboer et al.2006).
HHT can be lethal because ateriovenous malformations can
hemorrhage or lead to paradoxical embolism causing brain
infarction or brain abscess (van den Driesche et al. 2003).
Fabry’sdisease
Fabry’s disease is a rare lysosome storage disease, which is
characterized by the accumulation of globotriasylcermaide
(Gb
3
) and other similar glycosphinolipids throughout the
body, including the blood, due to mutations in the enzyme
encoding for α-galactosidase A (Fellgiebel et al. 2006;
Waldek and Feriozzi 2014).α-galactosidase A is mainly responsible
for removing a galactose from sphingolipids. In the
absence of the enzyme, Gb
3
accumulates in the lysosomes of
cells in organs and the vascular endothelium, and can manifest
into a variety of diseases including kidney, heart, and cerebrovascular
disease (Linhart et al. 2000; Waldek and Feriozzi
2014). For example, lipid accumulation in vascular endothelium
cells can lead to vessel occlusion, which may cause
stroke (Grewal 1994).

Mode of inheritance and genetic analysis
Mode of inheritance
A majority of the discussed hereditary neurovascular diseases
are autosomal dominant inherited diseases, such as CADA
SIL, Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease, and HHT.
Marfan syndrome is especially characterized by high penetrance
of the disease with just a single allele of the disease
(Canadas et al. 2010). There are also some uncommon diseases
known to be autosomal recessive, such as MOPD II
(Hall et al. 2004). However, some diseases are not only autosomal
recessive, but are also sex-linked, such as Fabry’sdisease
which is an X-linked disease (MacDermot et al. 2001).
In some cases, mutations in several genes have been linked
to the disease, making it difficult to identify the cause. For
example, mutations in ENG, ACVRL1, and MADH4 genes
can all cause HHT disease. In other diseases, like CADASIL
and MOPD II, a single gene has been known to be the root
cause of the disease. However, there are still numerous diseases
, which have been identified mutations in a single gene,
for example, Notch3 which has over 150 mutations identified
(Chabriat et al. 2009), making diagnosis of the disease difficult.
In single gene disorders, regions where mutations cluster
can be sequenced for mutations as a diagnosis method, such as
for Notch3. However, this is not feasible for disease such as
Marfan syndrome, where unique mutations in individual families
must be identified to diagnose future offspring.
Gene mapping and mutational analysis
Extensive research has been done to identify the underlying
genetic causes of these inherited diseases. For diseases such as
CADASIL, Marfan syndrome, MOPD II, and Fabry’sdisease,
the disease has been associated with one gene, which is
Notch3, FBN1, PCNT,andGALA respectively (Delaval and
Doxsey2010;Fellgiebeletal.2006; Kalaria et al.2004; Yuan
and Jing 2010). In Moyamoya disease and HTT, there are
many genes associated with pathogenesis of the disease. For
Moyamoya disease, most the disease genes are still unknown,
although a recent study suggested RNF213 as a disease gene
(Kamada et al. 2011). For HHT, the main disease genes are
ENG, ACVRL1,andMADH4 (Govani and Shovlin 2009).
Notch3 gene and CADASIL disease
Mutations in the gene Notch3 is solely responsible for the
manifestation of CADASIL. The Notch3 gene is located on
chromosome 19p13 and encodes a 300 kD Notch3 transmembrane
receptor protein (Kalaria et al. 2004). Notch3 is
expressed in VSM cells and is responsible for cell-to-cell communication
(Chabriat et al. 2009; Kalaria et al. 2004). More
than 150 mutations in the Notch3 gene are known to cause
CADASIL. Furthermore, the mutations are only in epidermal
growth factor repeats (EGFR) (Karlstrom et al.2002). All the
mutations are found in exons 2–24, with 95 % being missense
mutations, removing or inserting new cysteine residues, and
the rest being small in-frame deletions or splice site mutations
(Chabriat et al. 2009; Karlstrom et al. 2002). De novo mutations
have been reported, but are rare (Stojanov et al.2014). In
a recent study by Tan et al. (Tan et al. 2012), a R133C mutation
in theNotch3gene of a 5-generational Han Chinese family
was suggested to be a cause of CADASIL, as it was not
present in 100 normal controls. However, environmental factors
also seemed to play an important role. Carriers who were
not exposed to risk factors such as smoking, drinking and
hypertension, did not show symptoms of the disease (Tan
et al. 2012). In another recent study by Mosca et al. (Mosca
et al. 2014), a mutation in exon 6 (C340Y) and exon 15 
(R785C) of Notch3 were found in two Italian families with
CADASIL. These two mutations both resulted in an odd number
of cysteine residues in the EGFR.
FBN1 gene and Marfan disease
Marfan disease is linked to the FBN1 gene on chromosome
15q21.1 (Canadas et al.2010; Francis et al.2007). There are a
total of 65 exons in the gene (Yuan and Jing2010), but mutations
in exon 24–32 predict the most severe phenotypes
(Canadas et al. 2010; Robinson and Godfrey 2000).
Nonetheless, only 28–66 % of patients have aFBN1mutation
(Yuan and Jing 2010). Furthermore, FBN1 mutations have
also been described in other diseases such as familial aortic
aneurism and Marfan-like skeletal abnormalities (Canadas
et al.2010; Yuan and Jing2010). Missense mutations account
for two-thirds of all mutations in the FBN1 gene (Robinson
et al. 2002). De novo mutations of the FBN1 gene are quite
common, with a prevalence of 25 % (Ramirez and Dietz
2007). In a recent study by Sipek et al. (Sipek et al. 2014), a
mutation in FBN1 was found to cause neonatal Marfan syndrome.
The more surprising finding was that the mutation led
to exon 35 skipping, which is located outside the exon 24–32
region where most neonatal Marfan syndrome mutations are
located.
Moyamoya disease
Moyamoya disease has been linked to various regions including
3p24.2-p26, 6q25, 8q23, 12p12, and 17q25 (Janda et al.
2009;Parrayetal.2011; Sakurai et al. 2004), suggesting that
the disease is polygenic. Little is known about how the genes
are involved in the disease. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
alleles, located on chromosome 6, have been suggested to be
associated with Moyamoya disease. It is thought that HLA can
either control susceptibility of disease or other genes responsible
for the disease could have linkage disequilibrium with
1108 Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116
(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
mutated HLA allele (Inoue et al.2000). In 2011, Kamada and
his team identified RNF213 as the first Moyamoya disease
gene (Kamada et al.2011). A genome wide association study
using 72 Moyamoya disease patients and 45 control patients
identified a locus on chromosome 17q25 with strong association
to the disease. Furthermore, SNP markers showed a high
association with Moyamoya disease in a 151-kb region, which
was within the RNF213 locus. Mutational analysis of the
RNF213locus showed that 19 of 29 Moyamoya disease families
had the same single base pair substitution of c.14576G>
Ainexon60,resultinginanargininetolysinesubstitution
(p.R4859K). The carrier frequency of this mutation is 1/72 in
Japan and was not identified in Caucasian patients, which
supports the fact that Moyamoya disease is more prevalent
in East Asian countries such as Japan and Korea.
HHT disease
In HHT, the disease has been linked to a variety of genes:
ENG encoding endoglin, ACVRL1 encoding ALK1,
MADH4encoding Smad4, a gene on chromosome 5q between
D5S2011 and D5S2490, and a gene on chromosome 7p between
D7S2252 and D7S510 (Govani and Shovlin 2009).
Nonetheless, the genesENGandACVRL1cause approximately
85 % of cases (McDonald et al.2011). These genes encode
for transmembrane receptors that are important in regulating
transforming growth factorβsignaling in vascular endothelial
cells, they are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation,
migration and adhesion (Bossler et al.2006).Thereareawide
variety of mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 genes including
point mutations, deletions, insertions, nonsense mutations,
missense mutations, splice-site alterations, and intragenic rearrangements
(Bossler et al. 2006). In a recent paper by
Komiyama et al. (Komiyama et al. 2014), the variations in
mutations for HHT patients were studied among 80 patients
in Japan. Of the 80 patients, 53 had mutations inENG,25had
mutations inACVRL1, 0 had mutations inMADH4, and 2 had
an unidentifiable mutation. In a nation wide study of Danish
patients, among the 320 patients, 151 had mutations in ENG,
132 had mutations in ACVRLI, 5 had mutations in MADH4,
and 32 had no mutation (Torring et al. 2013).
PCNT gene and MOPD II disease
MOPD II is caused by mutations in the pericentrin (PCNT)
gene. PCNT gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3 and
encodes for a 370 kD coiled-coil protein (Rauch et al. 2008).
PCNTencodes for a protein that is involved in mitotic spindle
organization in centrosomes, and thus is involved in cell-cycle
progression (Unal et al. 2014). In knock down experiments
using silent interfering RNA, a lack ofPCNTlead to increased
cell death due to defective mitosis and chromosome separation
(Delaval and Doxsey 2010; Rauch et al. 2008). Splice-site,
stop, and frameshift mutations in the PNCT gene are responsible
for MODP II (Unal et al. 2014). Unal et al. (Unal et al.
2014) studied eight patients with MOPD II and the results
showed that seven of the eight patients had PCNT mutations.
Two were splice site mutations at 1937–2A>Gandonewasa
splice site mutation at 2609–1 G>A. The rest were missense
mutations: one was a K678X, one was E1041X, and two were
E1037X.
GALA gene and Fabry’sdisease
Fabry’s disease results from mutations in the GALA gene
encoding for a lysosomal hydrolase,α-galactosidase A located
on chromosome Xq22 (MacDermot et al.2001). In a study
by Whybra et al. (Whybra et al. 2001), 11 different GALA
mutations were described: majority were point mutations
and 4 were deletion mutations. From this, about half the mutations
resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity.
Mutational analysis by Nakao et al. (Nakao et al. 2003),
showed that all six patients studied had missense mutations,
with a total of 4 different missense mutations discovered. Li
and his team recently discovered a G144D missense mutation
in theGALAgene of a Chinese patient with Fabry’s disease (Li
et al. 2014). This mutation was not present in 676 normal
controls and is suspected to be involved in the dysfunction
of the enzyme.
Summary of genetic inheritance
The genetic basis of all six diseases has been well studied.
CADASIL, Marfan syndrome, MOPD II, and Fabry’sdisease,
have been associated with Notch3, FBN1, PCNT,andGALA
respectively (Delaval and Doxsey2010; Fellgiebel et al.2006;
Kalaria et al.2004; Yuan and Jing2010). For Moyamoya and
HHT, many genes have been found to be associated in the
pathogenesis. Nonetheless, much work is still being done to
discover mutations responsible for pathogenesis of these diseases.
This understanding is important in both developing
diagnosis and elucidating the mechanism of disease.
Genetic diagnosis
Despite the extensive mapping of mutated genes, there are no
standard genetic diagnoses for these diseases yet. Moreover,
there are often numerous mutations in different genes and
even within a single gene. For example, in Marfan syndrome,
over 1000 mutations have already been characterized inFBN1
(Canadas et al. 2010). For patients with family history of the
disease, linkage analysis using family genetic markers may be
a possible option. Furthermore, with advances in DNA sequencing
technology, high-throughput screening, and exome
Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116 1109
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
sequencing, genetic diagnosis of these diseases may be readily
available in the future.
In a paper by Markus et al. (Markus et al. 2002), it was
suggested that exon 4 of Notch3 can be sequenced first for
genetic diagnosis, as 73 % of families had mutations in exon
4. If the results are negative, exons 3, 5, and 6 can then be
screened as they altogether account for 13 % of mutations. On
the other hand, for Marfan syndrome, most of the mutations in
FBN1are unique to individual families, and therefore the only
way to genetically diagnose an offspring is to determine what
the mutation is in the parents, and then screen for it in the
offspring (Sermon et al. 1999).
Onset age and classification
Onset of the diseases ranges from infancy, childhood, or adulthood.
Recognition of disease onset is important in providing
early treatment to slow the progression of disease. Different
symptoms may be manifested depending on the age of onset.
There can be a large variability in the manifestation of a single
disease and the various symptoms. Some of the diseases are
also classified into further subtypes. Classification can be
based on the cause of the disease or, more specifically, by
the gene that is mutated in diseases if it is caused by multiple
genes.
Onset age
Marfan syndrome, MOPD II and CADASIL disease
Onset of the diseases can range from neonatal onset to an
onset age of 70. Marfan syndrome and MOPD II both can
have neonatal onset, although for MOPD II, actual
neurovascular complications don’t arise until childhood.
Moyamoya disease has two age peaks for onset, although
most symptoms are manifested during childhood. CADASIL
and Fabry’s disease are often seen in patients above 30 years
of age, and for CADASIL patients, it can be manifested up to
70 years of age.
CADASIL is known to be a late onset disease. The age
of onset ranges from 30 to 70 years of age, with the mean
age of onset being 45 years of age (Tan et al. 2012).
However, symptoms of migraine with aura may appear
early from age 6 to 48 (Chabriat et al. 2009). In contrast,
for Marfan syndrome, there is a highly variable onset age
of symptoms. Neonatal onset accounts for 22 % of patients
(Faivre et al. 2007). Primary and secondary complications
due to abnormalities in connective tissue are manifested
during mid and late adulthood (Dickman and
Kalani 2012;Pyeritz2000).
Moyamoya and HHT disease
Onset of Moyamoya disease is often during childhood, although
it may also be seen in adults around 30 – 40 years of
age (Zipfel et al.2005). In one report, there 15.1 % of patients
had an onset of the disease under the age of 10 (Baba et al.
2008). Furthermore, this disease has two age ranges where it
peaks: around ages 5–9and30 –49 (Baba et al.2008;Ikezaki
et al. 1997). There are considerable differences in the clinical
characteristics between childhood and adulthood onset of the
disease. For example, cerebral hemorrhage is the most common
symptom in adults, but it is uncommon in children
(Zipfel et al. 2005). Similarly, the onset of symptoms for
HHT is also often during childhood or adolescence. By age
10, 50 % of patients with HHT will start to have epistaxis
(nosebleeds), and by age 21, 80–90 % will develop epistaxis
(McDonald et al. 2011). Visible telangiectases develops 5–
30 years after symptoms of epistaxis (McDonald et al.2011).
MOPD II and Fabry’sdisease
MOPD II is a congenital disease, with symptoms of growth
retardation even present prenatally. The onset of cerebrovascular
diseases, however, is often during early childhood (Perry
et al. 2013), and can accelerate during puberty (Hall et al.
2004). In comparison, the onset of Fabry’s disease is later than
MOPD II and males generally have an earlier onset than females.
In a study by Galanos et al. (Galanos et al. 2002), the
average age of diagnosis for males was 26.1 years and for
females was 48.3 years. Moreover, for males, symptoms often
began appearing in childhood or early adolescence (Galanos
et al. 2002).
Classification of subtypes and related disorders
While this paper only focuses on six diseases, in reality, there
are also many related diseases and further sub-classification of
some of the diseases. Subtypes and related disorders of CADA
SIL, Marfan syndrome, HHT, and MOPD II are classified by
differences in the affected gene. In Moyamoya disease, all of
the genes related to the disorder have not been mapped out yet
soclassification is solely based on cause. Fabry’s disease does
not have a closely related disease or subtype.
CADASIL and Marfan syndrome
Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical
infaracts and leucoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is a disease
closely related to CADASIL. Compared to CADASIL,
CARASIL is an autosomal recessive disease with an onset
age of 25–30 years. The disease is due to mutations in the
HTRA1 gene, which encodes for an HtrA serine protease 1
(Fukutake 2011). Other than the typical symptoms present in
1110 Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
CADASIL, CARASIL patients also exhibit extraneural symptoms
such as alopecia and spondylosis deformans (Fukutake
2011). Likewise, Marfan syndrome is typically due to mutations
in a single gene, the FBN1 gene. However, mutations
have also been found in TGFβ receptor 2, which is classified
as Marfan syndrome type II (Mizuguchi and Matsumoto
2007). However, there is some overlap of TGFβ receptor 2
mutations to other diseases such as Loyes-Dietz syndrome
(Mizuguchi and Matsumoto 2007).
HHT and Moyamoya disease
Moyamoya disease can be classified into two types, primary
and secondary. The disease is classified as primary
Moyamoya disease if it is idiopathic, and as secondary
Moyamoya disease if the cause of vasculopathy is known
(Amlie-Lefond et al. 2011). On the other hand, HHT can be
classified into four main types. HHT type 1 (HHT1) is due to
mutations in the gene encoding for endoglin whereas HHT
type 2 (HHT2) is due to mutations in the gene encoding for
activin receptor like kinase 1 (ALK1) (Bayrak-Toydemir et al.
2006; Govani and Shovlin 2009). In rarer cases, mutation in
Smad4 is classified as HHT in association with juvenile
polyposis (JPHT), mutations on chromosome 5 are classified
as HHT type 3 (HHT3), and mutations in chromosome 7 are
classified as HHT type 4 (HHT4) (Bayrak-Toydemir et al.
2006; Govani and Shovlin 2009).
MOPD II disease
While this paper focuses on MOPD II, it is also important to
note that there is also MOPD type I (MOPD I). While MOPD
II is caused by mutations in the PNCT gene, MOPD I is
caused by mutations in RNU4atac, which encodes for
U4atac snRNA (Abdel-Salam et al. 2011). On top of microcephaly
and growth retardation, MOPD I involves agenesis of
the corpus callosum and has worse prognosis compared to
MOPD II (Abdel-Salam et al.2011). There was also previously
believed to be a third subtype of MOPD, MOPD type III,
but it is now believed to be the same as MOPD I.
Common symptoms and signs
Clinical symptoms vary between the diseases. However, some
common symptoms include cognitive decline, ischemia and
stroke, epileptic seizures, motor impairment, hemorrhages,
and aneurysms. Less common symptoms include psychiatric
symptoms, vision impairment, and cardiovascular
complications.
Cognitive impairment
Cognitive impairment and decline is a common symptom for
both CADASIL and MOPD II patients, but only occurs rarely
in Moyamoya disease patients. It is generally progressive with
age and can range from minor learning disabilities to dementia.
For CADASIL patients, cognitive impairment is the second
most frequent symptom of the disease, which progresses
with age. Some cognitive impairments include decline in verbal
and visual memory, language skills, reasoning abilities,
and visuospatial abilities (Chabriat et al. 2009). In a study,
60 % of patients over 60 years of age developed dementia
(Buffon et al. 2006). Some Moyamoya patients suffer from
slow cognitive and intellectual decline, but it is not a common
symptom (Parray et al.; Suzuki and Kodama 1983). Most
MOPD II patients can also suffer from mild mental retardation
and developmental delays. Some children have normal intelligence
levels, but may be impaired by a learning disability
(Galasso et al. 2008; Hall et al. 2004). Intelligence can be
affected by nutritional deficiencies in children if feeding was
a problem (Hall et al. 2004).
Psychiatric symptoms
Psychiatric symptoms are often very rare and are only known
to affect CADASIL and Moyamoya patients. About 20 % of
CADASIL patients will experience psychiatric symptoms including
severe depressive episodes and maniac episodes
(Chabriat et al. 2009). Psychiatric symptoms are very rare in
Moyamoya disease patients (Scott and Smith 2009).
Ischemia and stroke
Ischemic attacks and stroke are major risks factors that have
been identified in patients suffering from CADASIL,
Moyamoya disease, and Fabry’s disease. It is the most prevalent
symptom of both CADASIL and Moyamoya disease. In
Moyamoya disease, the risk of stroke or ischemic attacks is
especially prevalent in children.
Ischemic attacks, including stroke and transient ischemic
attacks, are the most frequently manifested symptom in
CADASIL patients, occurring in 60 to 85 % of the patients
(Chabriat et al. 2009). Most will experience two to five cases
of stroke over several years (Chabriat et al. 2009). Similarly,
ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks are also the
most prevalent symptoms of Moyamoya disease (Chiu et al.
1998; Scott and Smith 2009). It is estimated to be present in
about 50–70 % of sufferers (Scott and Smith 2009). 40 % of
children under 10 diagnosed with Moyamoya disease will
experience transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and 30 % will
experience cerebral infarction (Zipfel et al. 2005). MOPD II
patients often develop Moyamoya disease and will suffer from
strokes as well. Stroke is also a common symptom of Fabry’s
Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116 1111
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.74189803)
disease. In one study stroke was prevalent in 25 % of patients
before 40 years (MacDermot et al. 2001), due to small vessel
occlusion from lipid deposition. 31 % of male and 5 % of
females also have been reported to experience transient ischemic
attacks (Bossler et al. 2006).
Epileptic seizures
Epileptic seizures are not a commonly identified symptom.
Epileptic seizures have been known to affect only a small
minority of CADASIL patients (Singhal et al. 2004; Tan 
et al. 2012). Seizures are also not a very common symptom
in Moyamoya disease patients (Scott and Smith 2009). In a
clinical study of Japanese and Korean Moyamoya disease
patients, seizures were present in 4–7.8 % of patients, with
children being reported to have a higher incidence of seizure
than adults (Ikezaki et al.1997). However, in another study of
334 Korean patients, seizures had a higher overall incidence
of 10.8 %, and the incidence in children being 23.1 % (Han
et al. 2000).
Headaches and Migraines
Headaches and migraines are common symptoms of both
CADASIL and Moyamoya disease sufferers, affecting over
20 %. For Moyamoya disease patients, it is usually not a major
risk factor, but for CADASIL patients, migraine attacks may
be coupled with more severe risks such as meningitis or coma.
The first symptom of CADASIL patients is migraine with
aura, which is apparent in 20–40 % of patients (Chabriat et al.
2009; Tan et al.2012). Migraine attacks with aura are usually
short, lasting 20–30 min, but 50 % of the sufferers experience
severe attacks accompanied with confusion, fever, meningitis,
or coma (Chabriat et al.2009). In Moyamoya disease patients,
headaches are also a common symptom, with 63 % experiencing
migraine like headaches even after surgical revascularization
(Scott and Smith 2009). Nevertheless, headaches do decline
after a year in some patients who have undergone surgical
treatment (Scott and Smith 2009).
Motor impairment
Motor impairment is a major cause of morbidity in sufferers of
neurovascular diseases and it may often result from the aftermath
of stroke. However, Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease
, MOPD II, and Fabry’s disease patients also experience
joint, skeletal and muscle abnormalities and weaknesses, further
contributing to impaired locomotion. In addition, Fabry’s
disease sufferers also experience chronic and painful neuropathy
, which significantly impairs movement.
Motor impairments, such as gait disturbances, are often a
result of stroke in CADASIL patients (Chabriat et al.2009). In
an analysis done by Finsterer et al. (Finsterer 2007), some
patients also experienced neuromuscular symptoms such as
weakness, wasting, and reduced or exaggerated tendon reflexes.
Motor weakness is also a common symptom of
Moyamoya disease. In a study in Taiwan, motor weakness
was one of the most common initial symptoms of
Moyamoya disease, occurring in 49 % of cases (Hung et al.
1997). In another study of ten children in Japan, eight of the
children developed motor deficits, five of which were hemiplegia
and three were weakness of extremities (paresis) (Gross
and Du 2013; Yamashiro et al. 1984).
Loose joints are a common symptom in Marfan syndrome,
which may disrupt regular motor movements (Ramirez and
Dietz 2007; Yuan and Jing 2010). Some people may also
suffer from muscle hypoplasia, scoliosis, and myalgia which
affect locomotion (Callewaert et al.2008). On the other hand,
in MOPD II patients, motor impairment is usually from the
result of skeletal abnormalities (Rauch et al. 2008).
Developmental milestones, such as walking, can be delayed
by as much as 50 % (Hall et al.2004). Conversely, patients of
Fabry’s disease often suffer from motor impairments as a result
of painful neuropathy affecting the feet, legs and hand,
which they describe as burning Bpin and needles^.Itisthe
earliest symptom and a cause of significant disability (Galanos
et al. 2002; Luciano et al. 2002). The pain, however, tends to
decrease with age (Zarate and Hopkin 2008). 41 % of males
also experienced joint pains (Luciano et al. 2002).
Hemorrhage and aneurysms
Moyamoya disease, HHT, and MOPD II patients have been
reported to suffer from hemorrhage or aneurysm. Hemorrhage
is a common between these three diseases due to the presence
of thin and easily ruptured vessels. In patients with adult onset
of Moyamoya disease, hemorrhage is the most common
symptom, with 66 % of patients experiencing recurrent hemorrhage
(Zipfel et al.2005). This is due to the susceptibility of
the fragile Moyamoya collaterals to rupture (Scott and Smith
2009). MOPD II patients may also experience hemorrhage
and aneurysms as a result from developing Moyamoya disease.
In a study of 58 individuals with MODP II, 4 patients
died from rupture of CNS blood vessels (Hall et al. 2004).
Comparably, in HHT patients, hemorrhaging of the nose is
the most common and recurrent symptom. In fact, 95 % of
patients develop recurrent epistaxis (McDonald et al.2011). In
later years, recurrent hemorrhage from the GI tract also begins
to appear in 15–20 % of patients (Govani and Shovlin2009).
As a result of excessive hemorrhaging, HHT patients often
suffer from severe anemia.
Vision impairment
Vision impairment is a common symptom of both Marfan
syndrome and Fabry’s disease. In Marfan syndrome, the main
1112 Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
cause of vision impairment is ectopia lentis, while in Fabry’s
disease, the main cause of vision impairment is cataracts.
In Marfan syndrome, myopia and ectopia lentis are the
most common manifestations, with ectopia lentis occurring
in 60 % of patients (Yuan and Jing2010). Other irregularities
included retinal detachment, cataracts, abnormally flat cornea,
increased axial length of globe, and hypoplastic iris or hypoplastic
ciliary muscle (Dietz et al.2005;Pyeritz2000). Vision
impairment of hemizygotes and heterozygotes of Fabry’sdisease
have been studied: corneal verticilata was found in 96 %
of hemizygotes and 76 % of heterozygotes, triangular subcapsular
anterior cataract was present in 48 % of hemizygotes and
14 % of heterozygotes, posterior cataract was present in 9 % of
hemizygotes and absent in heterozygotes, and tourtuosity of
retinal vessels in found in 88 % of hemizygotes, and 21 % of
heterozygotes (Galanos et al. 2002).
Other cardiovascular complications
While these diseases are mainly cerebrovascular diseases, other
cardiovascular complications may also arise. Marfan syndrome
and Fabry’s disease patients often have cardiovascular
complications. A common complication of both diseases is
mitral valve prolapse.
In Marfan syndrome patients, mitral valve prolapse affects
35–100 % of patients (Milewicz et al. 2005), and can lead to
congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension when
manifested in young infants (Callewaert et al. 2008).
Nonetheless, progressive aortic root dilation and aortic dissection
are the main cause of mortality and morbidity (Dean
2002; Dickman and Kalani 2012; Pyeritz 2000). In severe
cases, aortic root replacements are needed to prolong survival
(Callewaert et al. 2008). Fabry’s disease is also associated
with cardiovascular complications. For example, mitral valvular
murmurs from either mitral valve prolapse or mitral incompetence
is present in 37 % of male and 23 % of female, and
paroxysmal palpitations are present in 62 % of males and
29 % of females (Galanos et al. 2002).
Treatment
For some diseases, such as CADASIL and Fabry’s disease
, the only current treatment is life long medication.
In other cases, such as Moyamoya disease and HHT,
treatment may be possible to repair or remove
malformations in blood vessels. Despite available treatment
, there is still a possibility of suffering from the
side effects or risks of treatment. Furthermore, there is
still much work being done on discovering better treatment
for these diseases.
CADASIL and Marfan syndrome
There is currently no proven or effective treatment for CADA
SIL, only the symptoms can be treated. Prophylactic and antiepileptic
drugs orβblockers can be used to counter migraine
with aura (Chabriat et al. 2009). Similarly, for Marfan syndrome
sufferers, life long β blocker treatment may also be
necessary for slower aortic root growth (Dean 2002;
Milewicz et al. 2005). Alternatively, prophylactic aortic root
surgery may be done (Dean). Exercise restriction must also be
implemented to reduce hemodynamic stress. It is especially
important to avoid intense exercise and isometric exercises
(Milewicz et al. 2005).
To treat Moyamoya disease revascularization procedures
can be done. Direct or indirect bypass surgery helps to improve
cerebral circulation (Fukui et al. 2000; Parray et al. 2011).
Direct bypass surgery is typically done on adults, and it involves
the superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery
bypass or middle meningeal artery to middle cerebral artery
bypass (Fukui et al. 2000; Janda et al. 2009). Indirect bypass
surgery is typically done for children due to the difficulty of the
direct bypass method. The indirect method involves neovascularization
of extracranial soft tissue (Fukui et al. 2000; Janda
et al. 2009). There can be severe adverse affects of surgery
including death, cerebrovascular infarct, or hemorrhage, motor
or sensory dysfunction, and cognitive decline (Janda et al.
2009). There is currently no medical treatment to prevent progression
of the illness (Fukui et al. 2000;Parrayetal.2011).
HHT, MOPD II and Fabry’s disease
For HHT, it is difficult to treat nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding
completely, therefore, prevention and management of anemia
is critical by eating a diet rich in iron (Govani and Shovlin
2009). It is also possible to get surgery to excise arteriovenous
malformations. Three types of treatments: surgery, radiosurgery
, and endovascular embolization (Krings et al. 2005).
Hormone or enzyme replacement therapies can also be
used. Patients of MOPD II typically have a limited life expectancy
due to cerebral vessel insults (Rauch et al. 2008).
Treatment with growth hormones have been used, but there
is little or insignificant response to the treatment. In some
causes, small spurts in growth can be seen as a result of growth
hormone treatment (Hall et al. 2004). On the other hand, for
Fabry’s disease, enzyme replacement therapy is the common
method of treatment and is effective for treating the progressive
impairment of renal and cardiac function (Fellgiebel et al.
2006). So far in Europe, two types ofα-galactosidase A are
available for treatment: agalsidase α and algalsidase β,the
later of which is approved in the US (Zarate and Hopkin
2008). Enzyme replacement therapy has shown to improve
some symptoms, but it does not resolve all symptoms
(Zarate and Hopkin2008). Furthermore, enzyme replacement
Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1105–1116 1113
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-141973949)
therapy is still imperfect, there are problems regarding the
limited access of the enzyme to vascular system beyond endothelial
cells, the effective dose and frequency of administration
, and presence of neutralizing antibodies (Fellgiebel et al.
2006).
Conclusions
There are many neurovascular diseases that contribute to mortality
and permanent disability. From this, a small fraction is
contributed to relatively rare, inherited diseases, in which the
underlying genetics has been extensively studied. The focus
of this paper was to review the pathogenesis, genetics, clinical
characteristics, and current treatments of six diseases: CADA
SIL, Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease, HHT, MOPD II,
and Fabry’s disease. CADASIL and Marfan syndrome are
diseases that affect vascular smooth muscle while
Moyamoya disease, HHT, MOPD II, and Fabry’s disease affect
endothelial cells of blood vessels. Despite differences in
pathogenesis and onset, all six of these diseases still yield
common symptoms such as motor impairment, hemorrhage,
and stroke. Thus, being able to characterize the mutational
changes may aid in early diagnosis of these diseases.
Furthermore, it may help elucidate the pathways in order to
develop better treatment.
CADASIL and Marfan syndrome
CADASIL is an autosomal dominant disorder that is a major
cause for stroke. It is a late onset disease and is due to mutations
in theNotch3gene on chromosome 19p13. Aggregation
of Notch3 as well as GOM leads to degeneration of VSM
cells. There is no treatment other than the use ofβ blockers
to counter migraines. On the other hand, Marfan syndrome is a
connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1 on
chromosome 15q21.1, which results in defective connections
between elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells. There is a
highly variable onset age. β blockers may also be used as
treatment, or, in more severe cases, aortic root surgery may
be needed.
Moyamoya disease and HHT
Moyamoya disease is characterized by the spontaneous and
progressive occlusion of supraclinoid internal carotid arteries,
leading to the formation of compensatory Moyamoya collaterals.
Fragile and thin Moyamoya collaterals are susceptible to
intracerebral hemorrhages. The disease is often onset at childhood
and has been linked to many regions including 3p24.2-
p26, 6q25, 8q23, 12p12, and 17q25. Direct or indirect bypass
surgery can be done to improve blood circulation. Similarly,
HHT is a childhood or adolescent onset disease characterized
by the abnormal development of blood vessels. It is caused by
several genes including ENG, ACVRL1,andSMAD4. Blood
vessels are usually frail and are easily ruptured causing bleeding
commonly in the nose, mouth or fingers. Surgery is a
possible option to remove arteriovenous malformations.
MOPD II and Fabry’sdisease
MOPD II is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is characterized
by growth retardation, with cerebrovascular complications
showing up during childhood. The disease is caused
by mutations in thePNCTgene on chromosome 21q22.3. The
only treatment for the disease is hormone therapy, but it has
had little effect. In comparison, Fabry’s disease is a lysosomal
storage disorder caused byGALAgene on chromosome Xq22,
encoding forα-galactosidase A. Lipid accumulation in vascular
cell walls usually results in occlusion, which may cause
stroke. Enzyme replacement therapy has been able to reduce
some symptoms.
Summary
There has been extensive work on identifying genetic mutations
associated with the diseases, with over hundreds of mutations
discovered for a single gene. Disease such as CADA
SIL, Marfan syndrome, MOPD II and Fabry’s disease have
been linked to a single gene, while Moyamoya disease and
HHT have been linked to a variety of genes. However, much
of the exact pathway or mechanisms are still unknown. There
should be a greater focus on understanding of how genetic
mutations affect the pathways and mechanisms of the diseases.
This can help us better understand and develop treatments
for the diseases. We should also use our knowledge of
the existing mutations to work on developing methods to easily
genetically diagnose diseases.
