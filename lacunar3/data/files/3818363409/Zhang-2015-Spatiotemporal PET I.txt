This study aimed to use spatiotemporal PET imaging to investigate
the dynamic metabolic changes after a combined
therapeutic approach of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
neuronal stem cells (NSCs), and Chinese patent medicine in a rat
model of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. Methods: Cerebral
ischemia was established by the middle cerebral artery occlusion
approach. Thirty-six male rats were randomly assigned to
1 of the 6 groups: control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Chinese
patent medicine (Qing-kai-ling [QKL]), induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs), combination of iPSCs and QKL, neuronal stem
cells (NSCs), and combination of NSCs and QKL. Serial 18F-FDG
small-animal PET imaging and neurofunctional tests were performed
weekly. Autoradiographic imaging and immunohistochemical
and immunofluorescent analyses were performed at
4 wk after stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared with
the PBS control group, significantly higher 18F-FDG accumulations
in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction were observed in 5
treatment groups from weeks 1–4. Interestingly, the most intensive 18F-FDG accumulation was found in the NSCs1QKL group
at week 1 but in the iPSCs1 QKL group at week 4. The neurofunctional
scores in the 5 treatment groups were significantly
higher than that of the PBS group from week 3 to 4. In addition,
there was a significant correlation between the PET imaging
findings and neurofunctional recovery (P , 0.05) or glucose
transporter-1 expression (P, 0.01). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence
studies found that transplanted iPSCs survived
and migrated to the ischemic region and expressed protein markers
for cells of interest. Conclusion: Spatiotemporal PET imaging with
18F-FDG demonstrated dynamic metabolic and functional recovery
after iPSCs or NSCs combined with QKL in a rat model of cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury. iPSCs or NSCs combined with
Chinese medicine QKL seemed to be a better therapeutic approach
than these stem cells used individually.

schemic stroke is one of the leading and life-threatening diseases
, resulting in high morbidity and mortality worldwide (1).
Existing therapeutic strategies including pharmacotherapy, interventional
procedures, and surgery are limited in improving the
neural function because of tissue damage after stroke involving
multiple deleterious mechanisms (2–4). Therefore, novel therapeutic
methods are needed to be explored.
Stem cell therapy is emerging as a viable option to restore
neurologic function after stroke (5). Transplanted stem cells have
the potential to replace the lost circuitry, produce growth or trophic
factors, and stimulate the host brain cells to release these
factors (6,7). For instance, neuronal stem cells (NSCs) could enhance
tissue repair and functional recovery after ischemic stroke
because of their ability to readily differentiate into neurons, astrocytes
, and oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo (8,9); induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can avoid the risk of immune
rejection and ethical issues that hamper the clinical application.
Recently, iPSCs have been applied to a variety of nervous system
disease models, including ischemic stroke (10), Alzheimer disease
(11), and Parkinson disease (12).
Traditional Chinese medicine is also an effective and unique
approach to cure neurologic illness (especially ischemic brain
injury) (13,14). As a famous Chinese patent medicine, Qing-kailing
(QKL) injection (modified from an-gong-niu-huang pill) has
great antipyretic and antiinflammatory effects, which has been
widely used for the acute stage of cerebrovascular disease in
China (15). The active components of QKL are cholalic acid,
deoxycholic acid, jasminoidin, and baicalin (16). A previous study
has demonstrated that a mixture of cholalic acid and hyodeoxycholalic
acid (2 active components of QKL) is able to decrease the expression

of inflammation factors including tumor necrosis factor-a and
interlukin-1b after focal cerebral ischemia (17). However, to better
explore the metabolic changes and efficacy in vivo after stem
cell or Chinese medicine treatment, a noninvasive, sensitive, and
clinically applicable approach is warranted.
PET affords the capability to conduct both functional and
molecular imaging, which can be used to monitor neurofunctional
alterations in vivo (13). PET with 18F-FDG has been
applied to detect the subtle changes of glucose metabolism
in vivo after stem cell therapy in various neurologic disease
models (18).
Although stem cell transplantation or QKL treatment can
promote functional recovery after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO), to the best of our knowledge, no study has been
published on the synergistic effect. Thus, in the present study, we
use spatiotemporal PET imaging to investigate the dynamic
metabolic changes after combined therapeutic approach of stem
cells (iPSCs or NSCs) and Chinese patent medicine in a rat model
of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Experimental Design
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Zhejiang University School of Medicine (protocol
ZJU201407-1-02-066). After the MCAO procedure, 36 adult
Sprague–Dawley male rats (weight, 220–270 g) were randomly
assigned to 1 of the following 6 experimental groups (n 5 6 per
group): phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection control, QKL treatment
, iPSC transplantation, iPSCs combined with QKL treatment,
NSC transplantation, and NSCs combined with QKL treatment. The
day of MCAO was defined as day 0. Rats were administered QKL
intraperitoneally daily from day 1 through 31, and stem cells or PBS
transcranial injections were performed 3 d after MCAO. Neurofunctional
tests followed by 18F-FDG small-animal PET studies were performed
at day 1 (before QKL injection and stem cell transplantation)
and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 (after stem cell transplantation). Immediately
after the final 18F-FDG PET scan, animals were sacrificed and
brains were removed for the autoradiographic imaging, immunohistochemical
staining, and immunofluorescence detection.
MCAO Procedure
Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury was induced by the intraluminal
suture technique as previously described (19). Reperfusion was
performed by withdrawal of the suture 90 min after MCAO (details
are provided in the supplemental materials, available at http://jnm.
snmjournals.org).
Neurofunctional Test
Animals of each group were subjected to neurofunctional testing
weekly using the Garcia neurologic grading system (20) to determine
whether iPSCs or NSCs combined with QKL injection could improve
sensorimotor deficit after ischemic brain injury. Serial neurofunctional
tests were performed and compared by a dedicated investigator who
was masked to the experimental groups (details are provided in the
supplemental materials).
QKL Injection
QKL injection was produced by Shenwei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
(lot no. 13032381), with a code number of Z13020880 approved by
State Food and Drug Administration of China. Rats were administered
QKL intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 mL/kg per day for 30 d. The
dosage and frequency of administration were modified from the
previous literature (15,21).
Cell Culture and Stem Cell Transplantation Procedures
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–labeled mouse iPSCs were cultured
as described previously (19). Briefly, mouse iPSCs were maintained
on a mitotically inactivated (mitomycin C) (Roche) mouse
embryonic fibroblast feeder layer in a new type of iPSC cell culture
medium. Humanized mulleri GFP (hmGFP)–labeled rat NSCs were
incubated at 37C in a 5% CO
2
humidified incubator in Neural Stem
Cell Basal Medium (Millipore) as described previously (details are
provided in the supplemental materials) (22).
The rat was placed in a stereotactic instrument (RWD Life Science
Co.). A midline skin incision was made in the skull, and then a small
burr hole was drilled through the skull. With a Hamilton microsyringe,
1.0 · 106 suspended iPSCs, NSCs, or PBS in a volume of 20mL were
stereotactically injected into the right lateral ventricle (anterior–posterior,
0.9 mm to the bregma; mediolateral, 1.5 mm; and dorsoventral, 3.5
mm from dura) in about 15 min (23). The needle was left in place for
an additional 5 min and then removed slowly over 5 min.
18F-FDG Small-Animal PET Imaging and Image Analysis
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and administered
approximately 18.5 MBq (500mCi) of 18F-FDG via the tail vein. The
images were acquired in a high-resolution microPET R4 scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions) for 10-min static acquisition. 18F-FDG accumulation
was calculated as the percentage injected dose per gram of
tissue using the AMIDE software package (version 9.2; Stanford University
). To assess changes of metabolism after MCAO, regions of
interest in the infarction area and the cerebellum normal area were
identified in images of the transversal brain sections. The lesion-tocerebellum
(L/C) ratio was used for semiquantitative analysis, which
was calculated by the following formula: L/C ratio5mean counts per
pixel of lesion region of interest/mean counts per pixel of cerebellum
area (details are provided in the supplemental materials).
Autoradiography
To verify the image data obtained by small-animal PET, 6 animals
(1 from each group) were sacrificed immediately after the final PET
imaging. Coronal brain slices (1-mm thick) were cut and exposed to

an imaging plate (BAS-intraperitoneal MS 2040; Fujifilm) for 15 min,
then autoradiographic images were displayed (details are provided in
the supplemental materials).
Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescent Staining
Immunohistochemical studies were performed to determine
whether transplanted stem cells could induce neurogenesis or
angiogenesis. Neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were used as mature
neuronal, astrocyte, and endothelial cell markers, respectively, and
glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and -3 for glucose metabolic markers
(Supplemental Fig. 1). The numbers of positive-stained NeuN and
vWF cells were counted, and the integral optical density (IOD) of
GFAP, GLUT-1, and GLUT-3 was assessed (details are provided in the
supplemental materials).
To determine whether stem cells can induce neurogenesis or
angiogenesis, iPSCs and NSCs were engineered to express GFP via
lentiviral vectors. Double-label immunofluorescence was used to
follow the fate of the GFP-labeled transplanted stem cells (n5 1 from
each group of iPSCs, NSCs, iPSCs 1 QKL, and NSCs 1 QKL)
(details are provided in the supplemental materials).
Statistical Analysis
One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the neurofunctional score,
the L/C ratio of PET, and immunohistochemically positive cells
among groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to
analyze the correlations between 18F-FDG uptake and neurologic
score, IOD of GLUT-1 and IOD of GLUT-3. Data are presented as
mean6SEM, and differences were considered significant at aPvalue
of less than 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software
(version 15.0; SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS
iPSCs and QKL-Enhanced Glucose Metabolism and
Functional Recovery After MCAO
The 18F-FDG small-animal PET scans allowed visualization and
semiquantification of the glucose metabolism throughout the brain
at each time point (Fig. 1). Semiquantitative analysis of 18F-FDG
radioactivity in the ischemic area showed no significant differences
among the 6 groups at day 1 after MCAO (before QKL injection
and stem cell transplantation). Compared with the PBS control
group, 18F-FDG accumulation was significantly increased in the
5 treatment groups at weeks 1 through 4, indicating that the treatments
with iPSCs, NSCs, and QKL increased glucose metabolism
in the cerebral ischemic area (Fig. 2). The 18F-FDG accumulations
in the NSCs and NSCs1 QKL groups were significantly higher
than those of other groups at week 1 (P, 0.05), then decreased
gradually after week 2. Interestingly, the 18F-FDG accumulation of
iPSCs1 QKL presented as steadily increasing after week 2 and
became significantly higher than those of the other groups at week
4 ( P, 0.05). In the combination of stem cell and QKL groups
(iPSCs1 QKL and NSCs1 QKL), 18F-FDG accumulation was
higher than that of the QKL-alone group. In addition, a significant
difference was found between the iPSCs and NSCs groups at week
4( P, 0.05).
The level of 18F-FDG radioactivity detected by autoradiography
was similar to that assessed by 18F-FDG small-animal PET in the
same brain regions (Fig. 3), indicating that in vivo small-animal
PET images were well consistent with in vitro autoradiographic
measurements. No neuronal or cortical teratoma was observed
in the transplant recipients at week 4 after iPSC and NSC transplantation.
At day 1 and week 1, no significant differences in neurologic
score were detected among the 6 experimental groups (Fig. 4). The
neurologic score in the NSCs group was significantly higher than
those of the PBS (P,0.01) and QKL (P, 0.05) groups at week 2.
The neurologic scores in the NSCs1QKL group were significantly
higher than those of the PBS group (P , 0.05) at week 2. The
neurologic scores in the 5 treatment groups were, respectively,
higher than those of PBS control group at week 3 and week 4.
There was no significant difference in the neurologic scores among
the 5 treatment groups at week 3 and week 4. The neurologic scores
of iPSCs 1 QKL group showed a better recovery tendency than
those of the iPSCs (P5 0.094) and QKL (P5 0.162) groups at

week 4. These results suggested that the injection of QKL and
transplantation of iPSCs and NSCs improved neurologic function
recovery from week 3 to 4. Moreover, the combination of iPSCs and
QKL tends to have a better promoting effect of functional recovery
than iPSCs or QKL alone.
iPSCs and QKL Induce Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis
The number of NeuN-positive cells in QKL, iPSCs, iPSCs1
QKL, and NSCs1 QKL groups was significantly higher than that
in the PBS group (P, 0.01). However, there was no statistically
significant difference between NSCs and PBS groups (P. 0.05)
(Fig. 5A). The IOD of GFAP in QKL, iPSCs1QKL, and NSCs1
QKL groups was significantly higher than that of the PBS group
(P , 0.01). The increased IOD of GFAP in the QKL group
reached statistical significance compared with that of the iPSCs
(P5 0.02) and NSCs (P, 0.01) groups. The IOD of GFAP in the
iPSCs 1 QKL group was also significantly higher than that of
iPSCs (P, 0.01) and NSCs (P, 0.01) groups (Fig. 5B). The
number of vWF-positive cells in QKL, iPSCs, iPSCs1 QKL, and
NSCs1QKL groups was significantly higher than that in the PBS
group (P , 0.01, respectively), but no statistically significant
difference existed between the NSCs and PBS groups (P 5
0.10) (Fig. 5C).
The IOD of GLUT-1 in the QKL, iPSCs, and iPSCs1 QKL
groups was significantly higher than that in the PBS group (P,
0.01, respectively), but there was no statistically significant difference
between the NSCs and PBS groups (P. 0.05) or the NSCs1
QKL and PBS groups (P. 0.05). Moreover, the IOD of GLUT-1
in the NSCs group was significantly lower than that in iPSCs (P5
0.01) and iPSCs1 QKL (P, 0.01) groups (Fig. 5D). A significantly
lower IOD of GLUT-3 was observed in the iPSCs1 QKL
group than in the PBS group (P, 0.01). The IOD of GLUT-3 in
the iPSCs group also showed a lower tendency than that in the
PBS group (P5 0.087). Similarly, the IOD of GLUT3 in iPSCs1
QKL and iPSCs groups was significantly lower than that in QKL
group (P, 0.01) and the lower IOD of GLUT-3 in the iPSCs1
QKL group reached statistical significance compared with that in
the NSCs group (P, 0.01) (Fig. 5E).
After 4 wk of therapy, tracing of the GFP-labeled cells
demonstrated that the transplanted cells survived and integrated
into the cerebral ischemic area (Fig. 6A). Double labeling of GFP
with NeuN, GFAP, or vWF showed that the grafted iPSCs were
positive for all 3 markers, suggesting that the transplanted iPSCs
differentiated into mature nerve cells (neurons and astrocytes) and
angiogenic cells (Figs. 6B and 6C). In addition, transplanted NSCs
expressed neurons and astrocytes markers.
Correlation Between PET Findings and Functional Recovery
Glucose metabolic recovery assessed by PET imaging was
significantly correlated with the number of GLUT-1–positive cells
(Fig. 7A, P , 0.01) and neurofunctional
score (Fig. 7B, P, 0.01).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, serial 18F-FDG
small-animal PET scans, neurologic function
tests, and immunohistochemical staining
methods were used for the evaluation
of therapeutic effects after stem cell and
QKL injections in a rat model of MCAO.
The following are the major findings. First,
increased cerebral metabolism with improved
neurologic function was observed
after stem cell and QKL treatment (single
or combined). Transplanted iPSCs survived
in the infracted area and expressed
the mature neuronal marker NeuN, the mature
astrocyte marker GFAP, and the endothelial
cell marker vWF. Transplanted
NSCs also expressed mature nerve cell
markers and were found in association
with vWF-positive cells, suggesting the
establishment of a neurovascular niche.
Second, different time course patterns of
glucose metabolic recovery were found

between NSCs and iPSCs: NSCs had a significantly better effect
within the first 2 wk, whereas iPSCs had a more steady effect over
2 wk. The iPSCs1 QKL group showed a steady increase of 18FFDG
accumulation and neurofunctional recovery during the 4-wk
period. Last, glucose metabolic recovery assessed by PET imaging
was significantly correlated with GLUT-1 expression and neurofunctional
recovery. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the
combination of stem cells and QKL for cerebral ischemia. By
using PET imaging and the other technologies, we were able to
find significant functional and metabolic improvements after stem
cell and QKL therapies.
Cerebral ischemia generally involves many different deleterious
processes and biochemical pathways, for instance, the production
of free radicals, glutamate release, rising nitric oxide, and leukocyte
infiltration, which eventually lead to cellular
injury and death after reperfusion
(24,25). In our study, significant positive
effects were found after stem cell combined
with QKL administration. Immunohistochemical
and immunofluorescence staining
verified that iPSCs and NSCs migrated to
the area close to the ischemic area, where
they expressed the mature neuronal marker
NeuN, mature astrocyte marker GFAP, and
endothelial cell marker vWF. These findings
corroborate other previous studies (on NSCs
or iPSCs used individually), which demonstrated
that stem cells survived, migrated,
and differentiated into mature neurons (26)
or angiogenic cells (19) and improved functional
recovery via promoting vascular endothelial growth factor
expression and enhancing endogenous plasticity in the injured brain
(27). Transplantation of iPSCs could improve the motor function,
reduce infarct size, attenuate inflammation cytokines, and mediate
neuroprotection after ischemic stroke (10,28). Furthermore, QKL
adjuvant treatment has been found to alleviate the aggravated inflammatory
reaction and protected injured brain by decreasing the
levels of Ca21 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (29). Active components
of QKL were able to protect the neuron through inhibiting the
level of tumor necrosis factor-a and interlukin-1b. When these are
taken together, significant recovery after stem cells combined with
QKL might due to a favorable microenvironment for both endogenous
and exogenous cells.
The second important finding of this study was the patterns of
glucose metabolic recovery after iPSCs and NSCs (with or without
QKL injection). NSCs had a significantly better effect within the
first 2 wk, whereas iPSCs had a more steady effect over 2 wk. This
observation was not entirely unexpected as it has been found that
iPSCs could form functional neurons and improve the neurologic
function up to 4–12 wk (19,27), whereas NSCs have significant
therapeutic effects at 2 wk after transplantation (30,31), yet the
prolonged effect in vivo has not been universally demonstrated.
We suppose that cerebral ischemia appeared to activate the neurogenesis
program: transplanted NSCs may act as a functional cell
type in an earlier time course after transplantation, whereas iPSCs
might differentiate into a more specific functional cell type before
promoting the recovery of cerebral ischemia.
Previous studies addressing brain glucose utilization have
considered GLUT-1 is predominantly localized on the endothelial
cells, and GLUT-3 is present in the neurons (32,33). In this present
study, glucose metabolic recovery assessed by PET imaging was
significantly correlated with GLUT-1 expression and neurofunctional
recovery. Especially, the overexpression of GLUT-1 (in the
groups of QKL, iPSCs, iPSCs1 QKL, and NSCs1 QKL) was
consistent with our findings on 18F-FDG PET imaging and immunostaining
of vWF, which indicated the delivery of glucose from
blood to brain through the blood–brain barrier by GLUT-1. Similar
results of GLUT-1 overexpression were obtained in a rat
model of cerebral ischemia after combined treatment of bone
marrow stromal cells and sodium ferulate (a drug used in traditional
Chinese medicine for treatment of cerebro- or cardiovascular
disease and to prevent thrombosis) (34). More interestingly, we
observed a significantly lower expression of GLUT-3 in the iPSCs
and iPSCs1 QKL groups than the PBS, QKL, NSCs, and NSCs1
QKL groups. Our consideration is that, under the microenvironment

with iPSCs, the transportation of glucose into neurons may not be
mediated by GLUT-3. This could be explained partially by a recent
study on a Na1-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-specific molecular
imaging probe, a-methyl-4-deoxy-4-18F-fluoro-D-glucopyranoside,
in a rat model of blood–brain barrier disruption, in which the expression
of SGLT1 protein was found mainly in neuron cell bodies,
exons, and dendrites (33).
In summary, our study is the first to use a combination of stem
cells and Chinese medicine for stroke therapy and report beneficial
effects of the combination therapy. In the future, this study should
be extended beyond the 4-wk treatment period to monitor the
long-term therapeutic response after iPSC and NSC transplantation
with or without QKL. This is especially important in view of
the studies reporting teratogenic potential of stem cells in rodents’
postischemic brain, although we did not detect tumor formation in
any of the animals during the 4 wk of treatment.
CONCLUSION
Spatiotemporal PET imaging with 18F-FDG demonstrated dynamic
metabolic and functional recovery after iPSCs or NSCs combined
with QKL in a rat model of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury. iPSCs or NSCs combined with Chinese medicine QKL
seemed to be a better therapeutic approach than these cells used
individually.
