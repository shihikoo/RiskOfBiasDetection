Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. However, treatment options to date are very limited. To
meet the need for validating the novel therapeutic approaches and understanding the physiopathology of the
ischemic brain injury, experimental stroke models were critical for preclinical research. However, commonly used
embolic stroke models are reluctant to mimic the clinical situation and not suitable for thrombolytic timing studies.
In this paper, we established a standard method for producing a rat embolic stroke model with autologous thrombus
formed within the common carotid artery (CCA) by constant galvanic stimulation. Then the thrombus was shattered
and channeled into the origin of the MCA and small (lacunar) artery. To identify the success of MCA occlusion,
regional cerebral bloodflow was monitored, neurological deficits and infarct volumes were measured at 2, 4 and
6 h postischemia. This model developed a predictable infarct volume (38.37 ± 2.88%) and gradually reduced
blood flow (20% of preischemic baselines) within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The thrombus
occluded in the MCA was able to be lysed by a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) within 4 h postischemia.
The techniques presented in this paper would help investigators to overcome technical problems for stroke research.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causesof death and disability worldwide,
but until now the treatment options for acute stroke remain limited
[10]. To develop the novel therapeutic approaches and understanding
the physiopathology of the ischemic brain injury, experimental strokes
were valuable tools. An ideal experimental stroke model needs to have
two features: occluded by autologous blood clots which can be lysed by
thrombolytics, such as t-PA[1]; the thrombosis and infarction closely
simulate human ischemic stroke.
At present, two major typesof ischemic stroke models have been developed
: intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
and embolic MCAO. The intraluminal MCAO was developed by Koizumi
in 1986 to simulate this impactful human pathology in rats. A modification
of the MCAO method was later presented by Longa (Longa et al.,
1989). Both techniques have been widely used to identify molecular
mechanismsof brain injury resultingfrom ischemic strokeand potential
therapeutic modalities. However, it does not reliably reproduce the
inhomogeneous vascularfindings at the microvascular and macrovascular
levels in acute territorial stroke[2]. Furthermore, the therapeutic window
for therapeutic options may be substantially shorter in this model than in
humans [5,9].
Embolic MCAO used blood drawn from the animal to form autologous
clots of specific size and composition in vitro and are subsequently (e.g.
24 h later) introduced into the cerebral circulation via a cannula inserted
and advanced along the internal carotid artery. Embolic MCAO causes
most human strokes and therefore models that simulate this type of
occlusion are useful for testing new thrombolytic agents. However, the
current embolic model failed to mimic the thrombosis and thrombusaging
since the thrombus was formed from dried blood clots in vitro or
other artificial emboli. In this article, we demonstrated a standard method
for producing embolic stroke with thrombus formed by galvanic stimulation
in CCA in rats. This model could develop a predictable infarct volume
within the MCA territory. The technique presented in this article was
suitable for the study of thrombolytic time window.

were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Peking Union Medical College and in accordance with the principles
outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
All animals were acclimatized for 2 d or more prior to surgery.
2.2. Experimental embolic stroke models and treatments
Sterilize all surgical tools by autoclaving (minimum 121°°C, 15 psi, for
20 min). Sanitize the surgery table and associated surgical equipment
using 75% ethanol. Anesthetize the rat with isoflurane (5% for induction,
2–3% for maintenance) in 70% N
2
O and 30% O
2
by a face mask. Confirm
anesthesia by a toe pinch. Shave the fur on the ventral neck and head
regions with electric clippers to expose the skin areas. Temperature of
the rat was maintained at 36.5–37.5°°C using a homeothermic blanket
control unit.
Disinfect the shaved skin and surrounding fur with 10% povidone–
iodine followed by 75% ethanol. Make a 2-cm-long midline incision on
the neck. Use retractors to expose the surgical field and dissect the
right CCA, external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA),
and pterygopalatine artery (PPA). Dissect the CCA free from the
surrounding nerves and fascia (without harming the vagal nerve).
Wipe dry the CCA with sterile cotton-wool mops.
As was shown in Fig. 1A,threearteryclampswereusedtoclose
PPA, ECA and the right CCA (the distal end). Put the CCA into the
electric clamp from the YLS-14B thrombus formation tester (Jinan
Yiyan Science & Technology Development Co., Ltd) and initiated the
galvanic stimulation (1.00 mA) for 225s.Thethrombuscouldbeobserved
(about 5 mm-long, dark black) after the clamp was removed. The thrombus
was smashed 5–10 times by an ophthalmic forceps with serrated soft
tip. Arteriopalmus was re-emerging when the thrombus pieces were
smashed into homogeneous pieces. The artery clamp on the right CCA
was relieved for 1–3stoflush the comminuted thrombus into the ICA
and the CCA was reclipped for another 10–15 min to channel the thrombus
into the MCA/lacunar artery by Willis circulation.
Recheck the recanalization of CCA after relief of all the artery clamps.
Closed the midline incision by suture. Laser-Dopplerflowmetry (2 mm
posterior, 5 mm lateral to bregma) was used to monitor cerebral perfusion
throughout the surgery. Only rats that showed sustained ischemia
to less than 20% of pre-embolic baselines were included. Animals with
spontaneous revascularization before thrombolysis were excluded (6 of
a total of 67 rats). Exclusion took place before assignment into the various
treatment groups: vehicle saline injected at 2–6 h after ischemia (n =
10); t-PA infused as a 10% bolus, and the remainder was infused continuouslyovera30minintervalat2 –6hafterischemia(n=10).
2.3. Monitoring on cerebral focal perfusion (CBF)
Focal CBF was monitored by means of laser-Doppler flowmetry
(Perimed, Sweden) throughout the surgery. Prior to thrombus occlusion,
a 1.2 cm long midline incision was made in the scalp to expose the skull
bone. The tissues on the skull bone were removed with a dental scraper
and sterile cotton-wool mops. The laser-Doppler probe was sticked at
2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to the bregma above the intact dura.
The perfusion unit (PU) value was recorded for 5 min as the baselines.
The results were calculated as the percentage change of PU values at the
endpoint compared with each baseline. The scalp incision was closed by
suture after the measurement. Special attention should be paid to avoid
the confounding effects of superfluous light, heterogeneous distribution
of superficial blood vessels, and movement artifacts on laser-Doppler
flowmetry.

2.4. Neurological deficit tests
Neurological deficits in the animals were assessed 24 h after the
surgery using a modified 5-point Bederson scale, as described in detail
previously[6]. The scoring was as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, forelimbflexion
deficit on contralateral side; 2, decreased resistance to lateral push
and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held by the tail; 3, very significant circling to the affected side and reduced capability to bear weight
on the affected side; 4, animal rarely moves spontaneously and prefers to
laydownorstayatrest.
2.5. Rotating rod test
A rotating rod apparatus was modified and used to assess motor
performance (diameter increased from 10 cm to 13 cm and lined with
1.5 mm thick rubber) [12]. Rats were placed on the elevated rotating
rod, which was started at 22 rpm over 60 s. Timing started after hindpaw
movement was observed. The scoring was as follows: 0 (walked on rod
for more than 60 s), 1 (walked on rod for less than 60 s), 2 (fell off
right after the rotation started), or 3 (fell off before the rotation started).
2.6. Forelimb function test
A grip strength meter was modified and used to assess the 
hemiparesis and strengthoftheforelimb[8].Aropeof0.5mmdiameter
and 20 cm long was fastened horizontally beyond a cagefilled with dry
wooden chips. Both forepaws were placed on the rope and scoring was
as follows: 1 (both paws could grip the rope), 2 (only one paw could
grip the rope) or 3 (no paws could grip).
2.7. Inclined plane test
Motor performance was measured using a sliding apparatus [13].
The sliding apparatus had a 60 × 40 cm wood plane that could be
inclined at an angle of 0° (horizontal) to 90°. There is a 25 × 15-cm
rough plastic zone in the middle of the plane for the rat to grip. Each
rat was initially placed on the 80°-angled incline plane 3 times to preaccommodate.
Each trial was performed by calculating the time which
the rat held its position in the plastic zone. Holding 120 s or longer
was counted as 120 s. Each trial was performed after a 1-min interval.
During this time the rat was returned to a cagefilled with dry wooden
chips, with which the limbs and body were wiped and dried so as not
to influence the friction coefficient by urine and feces. Trials in which
the rat held its position with one or more limbs slipping out of the plastic
zone were not included in the result.
2.8. Quantification of infarction volume
After the neurological deficit test, rats were euthanized and decapitated
and the brains were rapidly removed for the determination of
infarct size. Brains were perfused with saline, and 8 coronal sections
(2 mm thick) were stained with 0.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) andfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution to quantify the percentage
of infarct volumes. Edema correction was performed as previously
described [7].
2.9. Data and statistical analysis
All results are presented as mean ± SEM. In most cases, statistical
analysis was obtained by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
post-hoc Newman–Keuls analysis for multiple comparisons with SPSS.
For comparison of the mortality between t-PA and vehicle, aχ2test was
performed with SPSS. Pb 0.05 was set as statistically significant.
3. Result
3.1. General features of the embolic stroke model
The physiological parameters remained within the normal range in
all groups. In the vehicle-treated group, there were 3 rats that died 1 d
later of modeling and 4 in 10 rats died in 5 d. The overall mortality
was 40% in vehicle-treated stroke-only rats. By contrast, thet-PA-treated
animals had a significantly lower mortality (2 of 10 died in 5 d) as compared
with the vehicle group. As was shown in Fig. 1B, once after the
occlusion, cerebral perfusion in the middle cerebral artery territory
dropped below 80% of preischemic baselines gradually. t-PA treatment
significantly elevated the focal CBF and decreased the mortality to 20%
(Fig. 1C–D).
3.2. Success rate of model
In all stroke-only rats (67 rats), 11 rats died of intracranial hemorrhage
and edema in 24 h later of modeling, and 6 rats were excluded from the
success rate account as these rats were found to have spontaneous revascularization
before thrombolysis. The success rate of our experimental
embolic stroke model is 74.6%.
3.3. Analysis of brain lesion
Rats were sacrificed 24 h after the modeling and the infarct areas
were assessed with TTC staining. The result showed that the infarct
volume in the vehicle-treated group was 38.37 ± 2.88% which was
close to the traditional embolic stroke model. t-PA treatment induced
detectable recovery from the MCA embolism determined either by TTC
or HE stained (Fig. 2A–C).
3.4. Evaluation of the thrombolytic time window
Delayed t-PA administration at 2, 4 and 6 h postischemia shows
variety outcomes. t-PA treatment at 2–4 h restored perfusion reduced
24-h infarct volumes significantly, but no measurable improvement
with delayed t-PA treatment at 6 h postischemia was observed (Fig.
3A–B). t-PA administration improved all four behavior tests compared
to the vehicle group at 2 h and 4 h postischemia. However,
no measureable change in behavior tests between the groups at 6 h
after the thrombosis was observed.
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated a standard method for performingan
improved embolic stroke model in rats, in which the origin of the MCA
territory is occluded by fresh thrombus. The major advantage of this
model is: the occlusion of the MCA region with thrombus formed in
CCA is similar to thromboembolic stroke in humans. This model does
not require craniectomy and uses newly formed autologous thrombus
in vivo, which is suitable for performing preclinical investigation of
thrombolytic therapy. Compared with the traditional embolic stroke
model, this model could also develop a reproducible and predictable
infarct volume within the territory supplied by the MCA.
To perform this model, the well-shattered thrombus and its lodgment
is the key to success. Previous studies demonstrated that the dried blood
clot introduction is difficult to manage. It could be easily lead to variations
in infarct size and affected brain regions[3,14].Inthisstudy,wedemonstrated
how to prepare thrombosis in CCA by constant current for
1.00 mA, lasting 225 s. This condition only applied on rats weighted
250-290 g according to our preliminary study (data not shown). To precisely
lodge the thrombus and produce a reproducible embolic stroke
model, CCA should be closed for 10–15 min right after the black shattered
clots channeled into ICA. This is because the negative pressure caused by
Willis circulation would draw the clots into the MCA zone. The shattered

thrombus was also readily visualized at the origin of the MCA in all salinetreatedratsbutwaslargelydissolvedin all t-PA-treated rats at 24 h after
embolization.
To evaluate the success of our model, the CBF, four animal behavior
tests and the distribution of cerebral infarction were assessed. After the
infarction, CBF was decreased to 30% of baseline and this value continued
to drop to 20% at 6 h postischemia, consistent with previous reports [4,
15]. Without thrombolysis, 40% of the animals died within thefirst 3 d
because of brain hemorrhage or edema. t-PA treatment significantly
restored focal CBF, enhanced the survival rate and improved behavior
recovery. Moreover, we demonstrated that the tissue lesion was produced
mostly within the MCA territory as seen in the neocortex and
striatum regions, and t-PA treatment significantly reduced the infarct
size at 24 h after stroke. Together, our data demonstrated that the
thrombus could be lysed by effective thrombolytic agents in at least
4hpostischemia.
Finally, we note that there are several technical concerns that may
hinder the success of the embolic MCAO model. A common problem
encountered in performing the embolic MCAO model is early spontaneous
reperfusion after embolization. The occurrence of spontaneous reperfusion
is likely to be associated with the fragile extravascular coagulated
clot used to occlude the MCA [3,11,14]. We believe that this method
could meet the need of delayed thrombolysis study for the focal CBF
remains steady over at least 6 h. Animal behavior tests and brain lesion
can be observed 24 h after the embolism. Thrombolysis with t-PA at 2–
4 h restored focal CBF, promoted behavior tests and reduced 24-h infarct
volumes, but the lesion was obtained with delayed 6-h t-PA administration.
This was probably due to the ischemia-reperfusion damage caused
by delayed thrombolysis.
5. Conclusion
The techniques presented in this article should help investigators to
overcome technical problems in embolic stroke research. The surgery
produced highly reproducible infarct size by fresh thrombus in a short
time period (about 20–25 min) according to the protocol.
