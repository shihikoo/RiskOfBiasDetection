Charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) represents a family of small helical proteins
that contain an N-terminal basically charged region and a smaller C-terminal acidic region,
which are highly conserved in all eukaryotes. CHMP4B, a core component of the endosomal
sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, is requisite for endosomal sorting and
other biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that CHMP4B may be involved in
neuronal apoptosis in the processes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). From the results
of Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we obtained a significant
up-regulation of CHMP4B in neurons adjacent to the hematoma following ICH.
Increasing CHMP4B level was found to be accompanied by the up-regulation of Fas
receptor (Fas), Fas ligand (FasL), active caspase-8, and active caspase-3. Besides, CHMP4B
co-localized well with Fas and active caspase-3 in neurons, indicating its potential role in
neuronal apoptosis. What's more, our in vitro study, using CHMP4B RNA interference in
PC12 cells, further confirmed that CHMP4B might exert its pro-apoptotic function on
neuronal apoptosis through extrinsic pathway. Thus, CHMP4B may play a role in
promoting the brain damage following ICH.

1. Introduction
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating stroke subtype
resulting from bleeding within the brain parenchyma
(Andrews et al., 2012). It has an incidence of 10–30 cases per
100,000 people/year, which is increasing and expected to
double by the year 2050 (Qureshi et al., 2001). Evidences
during the past decades demonstrate that the fatality rate

of ICH at 1 month is approximately 40%, which likely results
from a lack of effective therapeutic schedule after ICH
(Brouwers and Greenberg, 2013; Keep et al., 2012). Though
multiple resources have been invested into clinical and basic
researches, this high rate of mortality seems still not changed
(Kuramatsu et al., 2013). Rupture of blood vessels within the
brain parenchyma lead to primary and secondary injuries.
The primary damage is induced by the dynamic of hematoma
expansion associated with mass effect; the secondary
damage comprised of many parallel pathways including
cytoxicity of blood, inflammation, oxidative stress and so on
together lead to irreversible injury, eventually cause the
disability or even the death (Aronowski and Zhao, 2011;
Zhou et al., 2014). Pathologic changes of ICH include neuronal
apoptosis, astrocyte proliferation and oligodendrocyte death,
which all implicated in the above processes (Bradl and
Lassmann, 2010; Gong, 2001). Among them, neuronal death
is regarded as one of the most crucial events which depend
on complex pro-apoptotic and subtle anti-apoptotic modulation
(L. Li et al., 2013). We here have only a sketchy of
understanding about the underlying molecular and cellular
mechanisms of ICH, lots of studies remains to be done.
Endosomal sorting complex required for transport
(ESCRTs) and their associated proteins (called CHMPs) are
conserved from yeast to humans, and function in the sorting
of ubiquitinated cargoes into intraluminal vesicles, which are
generated by inward budding of the endosomal membrane
(also called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), or endosomes)
(Horii et al., 2006; Katoh et al., 2003). On the way toward
degradation, ubiquitinated cargoes trigger the sequential
formation of protein hetero-oligomeric complexes called
ESCRT I, II, and III, which then help sorting their incorporation
into vesicles budding inside MVBs (Katoh et al., 2003).
During the processes, charged multivesicular body protein
CHMP4B is a core subunit of ESCRT-III, and facilitates the
biogenesis of MVBs and implicates in playing roles in multivesicular
body sorting (Hurley and Emr, 2006). Thereafter, the
vesicles and their cargoes will be hydrolyzed after the MVB
fusion with the lysosome (Horii et al., 2006; Hurley and Emr,
2006; Katoh et al., 2003).
In majority conditions, CHMP4B is part of the ESCRT-III,
and functions in the sorting of endocytosed cell-surface
receptors into MVBs, in the final abscission stage of cytokinesis
, or in the budding of enveloped viruses such as HIV-1
(Hurley and Hanson, 2010; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009).
However, in pathological conditions, CHMP4B, ESCRT-III associating
protein, interact with programmed cell death 6 interacting
protein (PDCD6IP), also known as ALG-2 (apoptosislinked
gene 2)-interacting protein X (ALIX), an adaptor protein
involved in the regulation of the endolysosomal system,
might participate in involvement with autophagy-associated
degenerative diseases or cell apoptosis (Mahul-Mellier et al.,
2006, 2009, 2008; Sagona et al., 2014). For example, Sagona
et al. (2014) indicated that CHMP4B was a novel common
component of chromosome bridges and micronuclei, participating
in the autophagolysosomal degradation of micronuclei
during lens cell differentiation and cataract formation
(Sagona et al., 2014). Mahul-Mellier et al. (2009) demonstrated
that overexpression of ALIX is sufficient to induce cell death
of motoneurons, whereas it prevented early programmed cell
death when mutated the binding sites of CHMP4B (Mahul-
Mellier et al., 2009). And the study by Mahul-Mellier et al.
(2008) uncovered that ALIX and ALG-2 regulate neuronal
death in ways involving interactions with proteins of ESCRT
via forming a complex with apical caspases and with the
endocytosed death receptor TNFR1 (tumor necrosis factor α
receptor 1) in the presence of calcium (Mahul-Mellier et al.,
2008). Additionally, there is also evidence indicated that
dysfunction of ESCRT-III was associating with frontotemporal
dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3), which caused
autophagosome accumulation and dendritic retraction before
neurodegeneration in cultured mature cortical neurons,
whereas its potential relationship with CHMP4B is not clear
(Lee and Gao, 2009). As CHMP4B involves in multiple cellular
activities, whether it takes part in the pathophysiologic
processes following ICH remains to be investigated.
To date, we know little about CHMP4B, especially involving
in neuronal death in the central nervous system (CNS).
Since CHMP4B is indispensable for participating in cellular
death, we hypothesize that CHMP4B may contribute to brain
injury following ICH, and associate with neuronal apoptosis
via caspase-dependent or -independent manner. In the present
study, we for the first time investigated the expression
and distribution of CHMP4B in rat basal ganglia adjacent to
the hematoma after ICH. This study was performed to gain an
insight into the function of CHMP4B in the adult CNS and
might make a foundation for further research and be applied
to clinical treatment for its role in injury and repair after ICH.
2. Results
2.1. Expression variations of CHMP4B following ICH by
western blot analysis
Rats in the sham and ICH groups were subjected to forelimb
placing and corner turn test at different survival times,
respectively. Rats of ICH with significant neurological function
deficits were chosen for subsequent experiments
(Fig. 1A, B). Western blot was performed to investigate the
temporal levels of CHMP4B in rat basal ganglia adjacent to the
hematoma at various time points after ICH. CHMP4B protein
level was low in the sham group, then progressively
increased from 6 h after ICH and peaked at day 2 (Fig. 1C, D)
(*po0.05). The data indicate that CHMP4B protein profiles had
a temporal change after ICH.
2.2. Expression and distribution of CHMP4B
immunoreactivity
To identify the variation and distribution of CHMP4B after ICH,
immunohistochemistry was applied to detect CHMP4B at 2 days
following ICH. The sham-operated group showed low CHMP4B-
positive staining (Fig. 2A, B), which consisted the result from
Western blot. By contrast, the number of CHMP4B in the
ipsilateral group was upregulated adjacent to the hematoma
(Fig. 2C, D). However, there is no significant change of CHMP4B
staining in the contralateral group compared with the sham
group (Fig. 2E, F). Additionally, no positive signal was observed
in the negative control (Fig. 2G). The expression of CHMP4B was
brain  research  1597  (2015)  1–13 2
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-740655533)
assessed by cell counting among the above three groups, and
the statistical data indicated that the upregulation of CHMP4B
appeared adjacent to the hematoma (Fig. 2H).
2.3. Phenotype of CHMP4B-positive cells
To further identify which kind of cell types may be relevant
with the increased expression of CHMP4B after ICH, we used
double immunofluorescent microscopy studies on transverse
cryosections of brain tissues by labeling CHMP4B (Fig. 3B, F, J,
N) with different markers, such as NeuN (Fig. 3A), CNPase
(Fig. 3E), GFAP (Fig. 3I), and Iba-1 (Fig. 3M). In the shamoperated
group, the staining of CHMP4B was merely restricted
to NeuN-positive cells, indicative of neurons (Fig. 3D). Following
ICH, intensive CHMP4B staining was observed in neurons
(Fig. 3C), while not in CNPase (Fig. 3G, H), GFAP (Fig. 3K, L), or
Iba-1-positive cells (Fig. 3O, P), indicative of oligodendrocytes,
astrocytes or microglias. No positive signals were detected in
the negative control (Fig. 3Q, R).
To calculate the proportion of NeuN-positive cells expressing
CHMP4B, a minimum of 200 phenotype-specific marker
positive cells were counted between the sham-operated
group and the group 2 days following ICH. CHMP4B expression
was significantly increased in neurons compared with
the sham group (Fig. 3S).
2.4. CHMP4B might be relevant to neuronal apoptosis
after ICH
Neuronal apoptosis is regarded as one of the most crucial
events after ICH (Wu et al., 2008). Our observation above
revealed that the up-regulation and distribution of CHMP4B
after ICH appeared in neurons, hence it is reasonable for us to
investigate whether CHMP4B is relevant to neuronal apoptosis
after rat ICH. Based on this hypothesis, we detected the
protein levels of active caspase-3. The expression of active
caspase-3 increased after ICH, and peaked at days 2 and 3,
which was relevant with the expression profiles of CHMP4B in
a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In accordance with the
result of Western blot, the immune-activity of active caspase-
3 was remarkably increased in the ICH group compared with
the sham group (Fig. 4C, G).
The death receptor Fas and its specific ligand (FasL) have
gained widespread recognition as an apoptotic mediator.
Moreover, CHMP4B participates in neuronal apoptosis might
be via caspase-dependence manner in the previous reports
(Mahul-Mellier et al., 2009, 2008). We then examined the
protein levels of Fas receptor (Fas), Fas ligand (FasL) and
active caspase-8. Expectedly, the levels of Fas, FasL and active
caspase-8 remarkably increased following ICH, and peaking
at days 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 4B), which were consistent
of the temporal profile of CHMP4B expression.
Fig. 1 – Alterations of CHMP4B expression following ICH. Corner turn testing (A) and forelimb placing scores (B) were displayed at
various time points following ICH. The ICH group exhibited distinctly functional deficits compared with the sham-operated
group over the first 5 days (*po0.05, significantly different from the sham-operated group), but was with no significant
difference at baseline for 7 days later. (C) Western blot was employed to detect the protein levels of CHMP4B adjacent to the
hematoma at different survival times. The expression of CHMP4B was relatively low in the sham-operated group, yet
upregulated gradually following ICH, peaked at day 2 and declined thereafter. (D) The bar graph indicated the density of
CHMP4B versus β-actin at each time point. Data are presented as mean7SEM (npo0.05).

To test the upregulation of CHMP4B, active caspase-3, Fas
and FasL whether occurred in neurons, double immunofluorescent
staining was employed after ICH adjacent to the hematoma.
As shown in Fig. 4D–F, H–J, the majority of neurons was
active caspase-3-positive, and the colocalization of active
caspase-3 and CHMP4B was also observed at 2 days after ICH.
Moreover, Fig. 4K–P shows CHMP4B colocalized well with Fas,
but just partly localized to FasL in neurons, indicating that FasL
was partly occurred in neurons. A possible explanation would
be that FasL was also/or mainly secreted from other cell types,
such as astrocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and microglias,
which were reported in previous studies (Krzyzowska et al.,
Fig. 2 – Representative microphotographs for CHMP4B immunohistochemistry adjacent to the hematoma. Low level of CHMP4B signal
was found in the sham-operated group (A, B). At 2 days after ICH, the ipsilateral group showed increasing CHMP4B signals (C,
D), while the contralateral group showed no significant difference in CHMP4B compared to sham-operated group (E, F). (G) No
positive signal was detected in the negative control. (H) The number of CHMP4B cells was largely increased comparing the
ipsilateral group with the sham-operated and contralateral groups. npo0.05 indicated the ipsilateral group was different from
the sham-operated and contralateral group with statistical significance. Scale bar left column, 100μm; right column, 50μm.

2014; Yu and Fehlings, 2011). Based on above, the results
together indicated that CHMP4B might implicate in neuronal
apoptosis following ICH.
2.5. Detection change of CHMP4B and cellular apoptosis
in vitro
To further investigate the role of CHMP4B on neuronal apoptosis
after ICH, we established hemin (heme with a chloride
ligand)-induced apoptosis model in PC12 cells in vitro.Ashemin
is released from hemoglobin accumulates in blood outside
vessel, which is thought to play an important role in intracerebral
hemorrhage (Levy et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2012; Wang and
Dore, 2008). We initially incubated PC12 cells with different
concentration of hemin at indicative time points to determine
the most appropriate stimulant concentration (25, 50, 75, 100
and 150μM) to induce apoptosis. From CCK-8 assay, a significant
reduction in cell viability was noted 18 h after treatment
with 75μM hemin compared to untreated neurons (po0.05)
(Fig. 5A), and at this concentration, cell viability decreased in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Also, we detected the level of
apoptotic marker, active caspase-3, with Western blot and
found that active caspase-3 levels increased concomitantly
with cell viability loss (Fig. 5C). Based on the in vitro ICH model,
we examined the CHMP4B, Fas, FasL and caspase protein levels.
Western blot showed the concomitant upregulation of these
proteins expression in a time-dependent way (Fig. 5D). Since
FasL is generally the membrane-associated ligand, soluble FasL
(sFasL) in the conditioned medium was also measured by ELISA.
From Fig. 5E, sFasL in conditioned medium of PC12 cells treated
with hemin exhibited progressively higher concentrations compared
to untreated group. And the concentration values of

were labeled with CHMP4B (red, B, F, J, N), neuronal marker NeuN (green, A), oligodendrocyte marker CNPase (green, E),
astrocyte marker GFAP (green, I) and microglia marker Iba-1 (green, M). The yellow color visualized in the merged images
represented the colocalization of CHMP4B with different phenotype-specific markers (C, D, G, H, K, L, O, P). No positive signal
was found in the negative control (Q, R). The number of NeuN-positive cells expressing CHMP4B (%) was significantly
increased in the ICH group compared with the sham-operated group (S). npo0.05. Scale bars 50 μm(A –R).

Fig. 4 – Correlations of CHMP4B with cellular apoptosis following ICH. (A) Western blot analysis showed the expression of active
caspase-3 increased, peaking at day 2, following ICH. (B) Western blot analysis showed the protein levels of Fas, FasL, active
caspase-8 increased from 6 h after ICH, and peaked at days 2, 3. The bar graph indicated the density of active caspase-3/Fas/
FasL/active caspase-8 versus GAPDH at each time point. Data are presented as mean7SEM (*, #, \widehatpo0.05). Compared
with the sham group, active caspase-3 was intense (green, C, G) via single immunofluorescent staining. Double
immunofluorescent staining showed the colocalization of active caspase-3 (E)/NeuN (D) and active caspase-3 (I)/CHMP4B (H) in
brain basal ganglia adjacent to the hematoma at 2 days after ICH (F, J, arrows). Sections labeled with CHMP4B (K, N), Fas (L),
and FasL (O), and the colocalization of CHMP4B/Fas (M, arrows) and CHMP4B/FasL (P, arrows) adjacent to the hematoma at day

sFasL achieve the highest level on 18 h after hemin treatment.
Furthermore, cell immunofluorescent staining was also performed
to investigate the sub-localization of CHMP4B with
neuron and active caspase-3. Fig. 5F showed that CHMP4B 
co-localized well with tublin-IIIβ, indicative of neurons, in the
presence or absence of hemin treatment, whereas active

caspase-3 elevated only after hemin treatment, and colocalized
with CHMP4B. Taken together, the results above indicated that
CHMP4B might implicate in the processes of cellular apoptosis
induced by hemin stimulation, and might be via extrinsic
apoptotic pathway.
2.6. CHMP4B regulates cellular apoptosis in vitro
To further explore the exact role of CHMP4B playing in
neuronal apoptosis following ICH, RNAi-specific to CHMP4B
was employed to knock down CHMP4B in PC12 cells. Western
blot analysis showed that RNAi-specific to CHMP4B had a
significant effect in reducing hemin-induced CHMP4B expression
in cells compared with nonspecific-RNAi (Fig. 6A, B).
Concomitantly, levels of Fas, FasL and active caspase-3 were
significantly downregulated after CHMP4B silencing in the
presence of hemin stimulation (Fig. 6C, D). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that CHMP4B played an important
part in cellular apoptosis induced by hemin via extrinsic
apoptotic pathway.
3. Discussion
ICH is a devastating stroke subtype with about 50% of patients
dying within the first month and only 20% of patients living
independently at 6 months (Sansing et al., 2009). At present, the
treatment options are limited with only supportive care and
rehabilitation shown to improve the outcome after ICH (Hwang
et al., 2011). Therefore, getting a better understanding about the
Fig. 5 – Detection of CHMP4B on cellular apoptosis in vitro. (A) Hemin treatment at different concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 150 μM)
reduced cellular viability in a dose-dependent manner at indicative time point (3, 9, and 18 h) compared to untreated cells
(control) assayed by CCK-8. (B) Hemin treatment (75μM) reduced cellular viability in a time-dependent manner compared to
untreated cells assayed by CCK-8. (C) Apoptosis associated marker, active caspase-3 was increased in PC12 cells after hemin
exposure. The relative protein level of active caspase-3 was calculated by densitometric analysis and reading was normalized
to that of the corresponding GAPDH. (D) Upon hemin stimulation, CHMP4B/Fas/FasL, active caspase-8/active caspase-9 upregulated
concomitantly, peaked at hour 18; the bar chart indicated the density of CHMP4B/Fas/FasL/caspase-8/active
caspase-9 versusGAPDH. (E) sFasL expression of normal (control) and hemin-treated PC12 cell culture supernatant in different
time points was measured by ELISA. The expression of sFasL is lower in normal PC12 cell supernatant than that of hemintreated
cells. The concentration values of sFasL achieved the highest level on 18 h after hemin treatment. Data are
representative of the average concentration values offive samples of each group. (F) Double immunofluorescence showed the
colicalization of CHMP4B/tublin-IIIβ and CHMP4B/active caspase-3 in the absence or presence of hemin treatment. After
treatment, the increased level of active caspase-3 colocalized well with CHMP4B. Scale bars 50 μm. Data are presented as
mean7SEM (n, #, \widehat, $, & po0.05).

underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of damage
following ICH is urgent for individuals and societies. Based on
the amount of bleeding and the predilection site in clinical
scenarios, the present study established an ICH rat model to
simulate clinical ICH. In this study, CHMP4B was upregulated
adjacent to the hematoma of ICH and the temporal changes
were striking in neurons, but not in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
or microglia. It reminded us that the elevated expression
of CHMP4B might be associated with neuronal apoptosis after
ICH. As expected, we found the expression patterns of Fas, FasL,
active caspase-8 and active caspase-3 parallel with that of
CHMP4B in vivo and in vitro studies. In addition, silencing of
CHMP4B by siRNA in PC12 cells can suppress hemin-induced
expression of Fas, FasL and active caspase-3. Based on the
above, we speculated that CHMP4B might be involved in
neuronal death via extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
The ESCRT machinery including ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and
work in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins in the process of
the invaginating endosomal membrane toward the lumen, and
this compartment containing inner vesicles is called the MVB
(endosome) (Ichioka et al., 2008; Katoh et al., 2003; Mahul-
Mellier et al., 2006). At the endosome, ubiquitinated proteins are
first recognized by vacuolar protein sorting (Vps)-27, a factor
required for MVB formation, and are then transferred to
recruited ESCRT-I during MVB sorting. ESCRT-I is then activating
functions of ESCRT-II in the recruitment and oligomerization
of CHMPs to form ESCRT-III. During the processes, CHMP4s
are components of ESCRT-III complex, and CHMP4B is a core
subunit of ESCRT-III for both the formation of MVB luminal
vesicles and the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo protein into
these vesicles (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2006; Trioulier et al., 2004).
Previous studies indicated that CHMP4s can delineate and
generate vesicles within the lumen of MVB and participate in
themembranescissionproves( Hanson et al., 2008). Apart from
the sorting for proteins, the ESCRT machinery is also involved
in other disease processes, such as virus budding, neuronal
development and some degenerative diseases (Moberg et al.,
2005; Vaccari and Bilder, 2005). For example, X. Li et al. (2013)
discovered that CHMP4B/C can interact with Newcastle disease
virus (NDV) matrix protein to facilitate viral replication (X. Li
et al., 2013). Sagona et al. (2014) demonstrated that CHMP4B,
through its association with chromatin, participated in the
autophagolysosomal degradation of micronuclei and other
extranuclear chromatin that might participate in cataract formation
(Sagona et al., 2014). In addition, numerous observations
suggest that, in several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Fig. 6 – CHMP4B promotes cellular apoptosis via extrinsic apoptotic pathway in vitro. (A) Western blot analysis showed siRNA
silenced CHMP4B in PC12 cells; (B) the bar chart indicated the density of CHMP4B versus GAPDH. (C) The knockdown of
CHMP4B induced decreasing levels of Fas, FasL and active caspase-3 in hemin treated PC12 cells. (D) The bar chart indicated
the density of Fas/FasL/active caspase-3 versus GAPDH. Data are presented as mean7SEM (n, #, & po0.05).

ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), AD (Alzheimer's disease)
and Niemann–Pick disease, affected neurons display an early
impairment in the endosomal system. For example, in AD
brains, endosome abnormalities appear in neurons long before
amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation (Nixon,
2005). However, the exact role of ESCRT-III in these processes
remain poorly understand. There is also evidence demonstrating
that CHMP4B is indispensable for neuronal apoptosis, as
Mahul-Mellier et al. (2006) showed that ALIX overexpression is
sufficient to induce cell death in neuroepithelial cells, while
expression of ALIX mutants lacking the CHMP4B binding sites
prevents early programmed cell death in cervical motoneurons
at day 4.5 of chick embryo development (Mahul-Mellier et al.,
2006). Consequently, on the basis of previous studies on
CHMP4B, we wonder whether CHMP4B can induce neuronal/
cellular activities through some other ways, such as promoting
neuronal apoptosis after ICH.
Primary and secondary damage both make up the injury
after the onset of ICH. Excluding the primary damage caused
by mass effect, the resulting hematoma can trigger a series of
unfavorable events which lead to secondary insults and
finally severe neurological deficits or death (Aronowski and
Zhao, 2011; Zhou et al., 2014). Neuronal apoptosis, astrocyte
proliferation, oligodendrocyte death and microglia activation
all participate in these processes (L. Li et al., 2013). Among
them, neuronal apoptosis is one of the most severe consequences
after ICH. Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell
death, comprises both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
(Elmore, 2007). By comparison, the extrinsic pathway activates
the subsequent caspase cascade more directly. Proapoptotic
agents include Fas, FasL, active caspase-8, and
active caspase-3 that are upregulated in our ICH model.
Moreover, immunofluorescence showed that active caspase-
3, Fas localized well with CHMP4B in neurons, while just part
of FasL was co-localized with CHMP4B in neurons. A possible
explanation would be that FasL might be secreted from
astrocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and microglias, which
were reported in previous studies (Krzyzowska et al., 2014;Yu
and Fehlings, 2011). Meanwhile, the experimental data suggest
that CHMP4B may also represent one of the proapoptotic
aspects in ICH. Therefore, it is reasonable for us
to understand that upregulation of CHMP4B might be associated
with neuronal apoptosis following ICH.
Taken together, all our in vivo and in vitro data indicated
the association of CHMP4B in neuronal apoptosis following
ICH. However, the exact role of CHMP4B on neuronal apoptosis
remains to be further explored in vivo, so as to seek the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms and therapeutic
potentials of CHMP4B for ICH.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Animals and the ICH model
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (240–260 g) provided by the
Department of Animal Center, Medical College of Nantong
University were used in this study. All animals were maintained
in a temperature controlled room (2271 1C) on a 12 h
light–dark cycle and the food and water were available ad
libitum. The number of animals studied was the minimum to
obtain significant results, and all efforts were made to
minimize their discomfort caused by the experimental procedures.
All surgical procedures and postoperative care were
carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory.
Animals were approved by the Chinese National Committee
to Use of Experimental Animals for Medical Purposes, Jiangsu
Branch.
For ICH model, the rats were deeply anesthetized with 10%
chloral hydrate, the right basal ganglia was exposed stereotaxically
(David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) using
the Paxinos and Watson's atlas. With the incisor bar placed at
3.3 mm below the interaural line (horizontal zero), the coordinates
from bregma to the guide the cannula were 0.2 mm
anterior, 3.5 mm lateral, and 5.5 mm dorsoventral. Autologous
whole blood (50ml) was collected by cutting the tail tip,
and drawing into a sterile syringe. The syringe was secured in
the frame, and the needle was quickly introduced into right
basal ganglia. The sham group only had a needle insertion.
After injection, the sterile syringe was left in situ for over
10 min, and then closed the skin incision. The animals were
allowed to recover from surgery (Xue and Del Bigio, 2000).
Experimental animals (n¼6 per time point) were anesthetized
to extract the protein for Western blot analysis at
indicated time points (6 and 12 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days)
following ICH.
4.2. Behavioral testing procedures
4.2.1. Forelimb placing test
The rats were held by torsos, thus the forelimb could hang
free. Independent testing of each forelimb was elicited by
brushing the respective vibrissae on the corner edge of a
countertop. Intact animals place the forelimb quickly onto
the countertop. According to the extent of injury, the ICH rats
placing of the forelimb contralateral to the infusion may be
impaired. During the experiments, each rat was tested
10 times for each forelimb, and the percentage of trials in
which the rat placed the left forelimb was calculated as the
forelimb placing score (Hua et al., 2002).
4.2.2. Corner turn test
The rats were allowed to proceed into a corner, the angle of
which was 301. To exit the corner, the rat should turn either
to the left or to the right. Only the turns involving full rearing
along either wall was included. Depending on the extent of
injury, rats may show a tendency to turn to the side of the
injury and the percentage of right turns was scored. The trial
was repeated 10 times, with at least 30 s interval for each trial
(Karabiyikoglu et al., 2004).
4.3. Western blot analysis
Rats were sacrificed at different time points by injecting
overdose of chloral hydrate. Tissues surrounding the hematoma
(2 mm) from the ICH or corresponding areas from the
sham rats were dissected and flash-frozen at 80 1C. For
brain tissue proteins, the samples were weighted and cut into
pieces, then homogenized in modified RIPA lysis buffer

( 8.0.0.2542.683928069 PDF Extractor SDK EVAL VERSION)
(150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% sodium deoxycholate,
5 mM EDTA), phosphatases inhibitor cocktails and protease
inhibitor cocktail tablet. The supernatant was collected by
centrifuging tissue homogenate at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in a
microcentrifuge at 4 1C. After the determination of concentration
with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the samples were
subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to a polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF) filter membrane
by a transfer apparatus at 300 mA for 1.5 h. The
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated
with primary antibody against CHMP4B (rabbit; 1:1000;
Santa Cruz), FasL (mouse; 1:500; Santa Cruz), Fas (mouse;
1:500; Santa Cruz), active caspase-3 (mouse or rabbit; 1:1000;
Santa Cruz), active caspase-8 (rabbit; 1:1000; Santa Cruz),
active caspase-9 (mouse; 1:500; Santa Cruz), GAPDH (rabbit;
1:1000; Santa Cruz) and β-actin (mouse; 1:1000; Santa Cruz)
overnight. After washing with TBST, the blots were incubated
with secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature (RT)
and detected using either an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) kit (Pierce) or scanned with the Odyssey infrared
imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience). All results shown are
representative of at least three independent experiments.
4.4. Sections and immunohistochemistry
Rats two days after autologous whole blood injection or from
the sham group were anesthetized and perfused with 500 mL
of 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After
perfusion, the brains were removed and post-fixed in the
same fixative for 24 h and transferred to 20% sucrose for 2–3
days, followed by immersion in 30% sucrose for another 2–3
days, respectively. The Tissues were then cut at 5mm with a
cryostat and the sections were stored at 20 1C until use.
For immunohistochemistry, brain sections were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and treated with 3% H
2
O
2
for
10 min at RT to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity. The
sections were blocked with confining liquid consisting of 10%
donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). 0.3% Triton
X-100, and 0.15% Tween-20 for 2 h at RT, then incubated with
anti-CHMP4Bantibody(rabbit;1:100;SantaCruz)for2h.After
washing in PBS, the sections were incubated in secondary
antibodies at 37 1C for 30min. In the final, the sections were
color-reacted with the liquid mixture (0.02% diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB), 0.1% PBS and 3% H
2
O
2
). Then, the
sections were air-dried, dehydrated, covered with coverslips
andexaminedusingLeicamicroscope(Germany).
4.5. Immunofluorescent staining
For double immunofluorescent labeling, sections were prepared
as previously. After air-dried for 2 h, sections were first blocked
with normal serum blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.3% Triton X-100, and 0.15%
Tween-20) for 2 h at RT. Then, the sections were incubated with
primary antibodies against CHMP4B (rabbit; 1:100; Santa Cruz),
NeuN (mouse; 1:300; Chemicon), CNPase (mouse; 1:200; Sigma),
GFAP (mouse; 1:100; Sigma), Iba-1 (mouse; 1:100; Santa Cruz),
FasL (mouse; 1:50; Santa Cruz), Fas (mouse; 1:50; Santa Cruz) 
and active caspase-3 (mouse or rabbit; 1:200; Santa Cruz).
Briefly, sections were incubated with both primary antibodies
overnight at 4 1C, followed by a mixture of FITC- and TRITC-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
for 2 h at 4 1C. Images were captured using a Leicafluorescence
microscope (Wetzlar, Germany).
4.6. Quantitative analysis
Cells double labeled for CHMP4B and cell phenotypic markers
used in the experiment were quantified. To identify the ratio
of each phenotype-specific marker-positive cells expressing
CHMP4B, at least 200 phenotype-specific marker-positive
cells were counted surrounding the hematoma in each section.
Then, doublelabeled cells for CHMP4B and phenotypespecific markers were recorded. A total of three adjacent
sections per animal were sampled.
4.7. Cell culture procedures and experimental treatments
Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were purchased from the
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Chinese
Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Ham's
F12 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5%
fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 1C in a 5% CO
2
humidified incubator. To study neuronal apoptosis in vitro, PC12 cells
were induced for differentiation using 100 mg/ml nerve
growth factor (NGF, R&D system) supplemented with 1%
FBS in F12 medium for 3 days, and then exposed to hemin
for indicative times.
4.8. CCK-8 assay
The viability of PC12 cells under various treatment conditions
was assayed using the commercial cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8)
in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan). For the dose experiment, PC12 cells were
exposed to hemin (25, 50, 75, and 150μM) for indicative time
points (3, 9, and 18 h) in treatment medium. CCK-8 solution
was added to each well at a final concentration of 10% (v/v)
and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 1C. The absorbance was measured
at 490/630 nm by the microplate reader (Bio-Rad). For
measurement of neurotoxicity, PC12 cells were exposed to
hemin for different time point, and then CCK-8 assay was
performed. The experiments were repeated at least 5 replicates
of each treatment.
4.9. Quantification of sFasL in the supernatant of PC12
cells
According to the manufacturer's instructions, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits with an antibody that
recognizes rat FasL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) was
used to determine the concentration of FasL in the supernatant
of cultured PC12 cells (1106cells/well). To quantify
the concentration of FasL in cultured medium of PC12 cells,
the supernatant was collected after treatment with hemin for
indicative time points. The sample without treatment was
used to construct a standard curve and to obtain absolute
values for calibration. The concentration was determined in
brain  research  1597  (2015)  1– 13 11
