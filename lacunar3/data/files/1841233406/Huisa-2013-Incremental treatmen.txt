Abstract Transcranial near-infrared laser therapy (TLT)
improves behavioral outcome in animal stroke models when
applied as single treatment within the 24 h of the stroke
onset. It is unknown if the multiple TLT treatments have an
added beneficial effect. We aim to determine whether multiple
irradiations with TLT would have further improvement
in behavioral outcomes in the rabbit small clot embolic
stroke model (RSCEM). Using the RSCEM, two and three
TLT treatments (7.5–20 mW/cm2) were compared against
single laser treatment alone (7.5–10.8 mW/cm2). Two sham
irradiation groups were added for the control curves. The
double treatment group received TLT at 3 and 5 h and the
triple treatment group at 2, 3, and 4 h after embolization.
Behavioral analysis was conducted 24 h after embolization
using a dichotomized behavioral score. The determination
of the effective clot amount (milligrams) that produces
neurological deficits in 50 % of the rabbits (P
50
) was used
to compare TLT treatments with the sham. The P
50
for
double treatment was 5.47±0.90, with n039; the
corresponding P
50
value for a single treatment was 3.87±
0.73, with n038; and the corresponding control curve was
3.25±0.4, n032. The P
50
for triple treatment was 5.91±
0.49, with n023; the corresponding P
50
value for a single
treatment was 3.09±0.59, withn015, and the corresponding
control curve was 1.71±0.26, with n017. The triple
treatment had 91 % improvement when compared with the
single treatment and 245 % improvement when compared
with the sham. The present study suggests that the additional
TLT treatments provide further behavioral improvement
when given during the acute ischemic stroke phase.

Introduction
Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) uses low-powered laser
light, at wavelengths from approximately 600–1,100 nm to
induce a photochemical reaction in the cell, without generating
heat, by a process referred to as biostimulation or
photobiomodulation [1]. Transcranial infrared laser therapy
(TLT) is a form of LLLT that is able to penetrate the skull at
full strength and is capable to photostimulate the brain tissue
located a few centimeters below the skull [2].
The effects of TLT in acute ischemic stroke have been
widely studied. Lapchak et al. used the rabbit small clot
embolic stroke model (RSCEM) to demonstrate long-term
behavioral improvement with TLT when treating animals at
3 and 6 h after embolization [3]. Using the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model, Oron et al. demonstrated
that TLT applied at 24 h after the ischemic injury produced a
significant improvement of the neurological severity score as
compared with the controls when measured 14 days after the
stroke [4]. Detaboada et al. replicated these results in the same
rat MCAO model [5]. Likewise, human studies have showed
safety and favorable effects when TLT is applied as a single
treatment within 24 h of the stroke onset [6, 7]. The Neuro-
Thera Effectiveness and Safety Trials (NEST) 1 and 2

demonstrated safety for human treatment in acute ischemic
stroke [6, 7], and the pooled analysis of both trials showed
efficacy of TLT treatment for reduction in long-term disability
measured by the modified Rankin Scale [8].
The different treatment times, irradiation doses, and energy
levels of TLT tested in acute ischemic stroke models
have been frequently successful in reaching good outcomes
[3–6,9,10]. However, the optimal timing and the irradiation
dose for acute ischemic stroke have not yet been established.
Some studies have shown an incremental benefit of LLLT
with higher irradiation power and energy levels. But applying
additional LLLT energy can have minimal or no effect
on the target tissue due to the biphasic response of LLLT
[11]. Further irradiation can even be detrimental to the tissue
itself due to its thermal effect [12].
Most of the neuroprotective therapies tested in animals
have shown better efficacy when used early in the ischemic
injury process, but eventually losing their efficacy as time
from onset to initiation of therapy increases [13]. In contrast
TLT appears to be equally effective when applied at different
times within the first 24 h of the ischemic brain injury. It
is possible, therefore, that TLT has the potential to photomodulate
at different stages of the brain ischemic cascade.
We postulate that the multiple treatments of TLT during the
acute ischemia will act synergically, enhancing furthermore
the behavioral outcome. The purpose for this study was to
determine whether the second and third irradiation treatment
with TLT during the ischemic phase of the stroke would
result in additional improvement of the behavioral outcomes
using the RSCEM.
Methods
All the animal procedures used in this study were approved
by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Veterans
Administration San Diego Healthcare System and met the
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Male New
Zealand white rabbits (Western Oregon Rabbit Co. Philomath
, OR, USA) weighing 2 to 2.5 kg were used for the
experiments.
All surgical procedures and microemboli preparation
were done as described previously [14]. Briefly, rabbits
were anesthetized with isoflurane through a facemask at
5 % in 3 L/min during induction and 3 % in 3 L/min as a
maintenance dose. The right internal carotid artery was
exposed, and the external carotid artery and the common
carotid artery were ligated. The additional branches which
are seen originating from the internal carotid artery were
also ligated. A catheter oriented towards the brain was
inserted into the common carotid and secured with ligatures.
The incision was closed around the catheter, and the catheter
was filled with heparinized saline and plugged with
injection caps. The animals were allowed to recover from
anesthesia for at least 2 h before embolization. Microemboli
were prepared from blood drawn from a donor rabbit and
allowed to clot at 37 °C for 3.5 h. The clot was suspended in
Dulbecco's PBS solution containing 0.1 % bovine serum
albumin and fragmented with a polytron. The clot fragments
were sized by sequential filtration through 240 μm2 screen
and 100μm2 nylon net. The clots retained by the nylon net
were washed, suspended again in PBS, and allowed to
settle. The supernatant was then removed and the particles
were mixed with tracer quantities of 15 μm radio-labeled
microspheres. An aliquot of particles was then removed for
the determination of specific activity. The appropriate volumes
of PBS solution were then added to the particles so
that a predetermined weight of particles was suspended in
1 mL, and these suspended particles were drawn into a syringe.
The clot particles were rapidly injected through the
carotid catheter and then flushed with 3 mL of normal saline.
After the embolization process was completed, the catheter
was ligated close to the neck, and the remaining exposed
catheter and injection ports were cut off. Before returning
the animals to the cages, they were observed continuously
for a minimum of 1 h after the treatments. The surviving
animals were euthanized 24 h post embolization with 1 to
1.5 mL of Beuthanasia-D through the marginal ear vein.
Transcranial laser therapy and treatment allocation
The rabbits were randomly allocated into treatment groups
before embolization, with concealment of the randomization
sequence until all behavioral and postmortem analyses were
complete. For the TLT treatments, rabbits were placed in a
Plexiglas restrainer for the duration of the treatment, and the
laser probe was placed in direct contact with the skin overlying
the skull. An AcuLaser low-energy laser, with wavelength
of 808.5 nm and fitted with an OZ Optics Ltd fiber optic cable
and with laser probe measuring 2 cm in diameter, was used.
To assess the effect of multiple doses of TLT treatment
during the acute ischemia, two sets of experiments were
planned using the RSCEM. The first group of rabbits was
randomized to double TLT treatment with a power dose of
7.5 mW/cm2given at 3 and 5 h or a single TLT given at 3 h.
After the completion of the first group of experiments with
the double laser treatment, we adjusted the settings for the
triple laser dose experiments by increasing the power and
narrowing the treatment times. In this second group, the
animals were randomly assigned with triple TLT treatments
at 2, 3, and 4 h post embolization or single TLT at 2 h post
embolization. We used a power dose of 10.8 mW/cm2 for
the single therapy and 20 mW/cm2 for the triple therapy
group. The irradiation treatment duration was 2 min for each
dose in all laser experiments. The independent control
curves were obtained for each set of experiments, and

behavioral analysis was conducted 24 h after embolization.
The behavior of each animal was rated as either normal or
abnormal/dead using a dichotomized behavioral score by an
examiner blinded to the original treatment assignment. The
behaviorally normal rabbits did not have any signs of impairment
; whereas behaviorally abnormal rabbits had loss of
balance, head leans, circling, seizure-type activity, or limb
paralysis.
The total radioactivity in the brain was measured by
placing small pieces of the dissected brain into a portable
gamma counter, and the amount of radiolabel present in the
brain was compared with that contained in the labeled blood
clot before embolization. If fewer than 10 % of the total
counts were found in the brain, it was assumed that the
labeled blood clot had not reached the brain, and the animal
was excluded from analyses.
Quantal response analysis
Briefly, to evaluate the quantitative relationship between the
number of clots in the brain and neurological deficits, logistic
S-shaped curves were fitted by a computer to the quantal
dose–response data. These variables are measures of the
amount in milligrams of the microclot that produce neurologic
dysfunction in 50 % of animals in a group (P
50
). A
separate curve is generated for each TLT treatment group,
and a statistically significant increase in the P
50
value compared
with control is indicative of a behavioral improvement.
The data were analyzed using the t test, which
included the Bonferroni correction when appropriate.
Results
In the first randomized group of rabbits, theP
50
value for the
sham at 5 h after embolization was 3.25±0.49 mg, with
slope of 4.84±2.06 and n032. Rabbits that were treated
3 h post embolization with a single TLT had P
50
value of
3.87±0.73 mg, with slope of 2.13±0.89 andn038. The TLT
double treatment, given at 3 and 5 h of the stroke onset, has
significantly increased the P
50
by 69 % compared to the
sham; the P
50
value was 5.47±0.90 mg, with slope of 3.76±
1.78 and n039. The double laser therapy had a nonsignificant
increase of 41 % in animal behavior improvement
when compared with the single laser treatment (Fig. 1).
In the second randomized group of rabbits, the P
50
of the
sham at 24 h after embolization was 1.71±0.26 mg, with
slope of 5.02±3.13 and n017. The animals that were treated
at 2 h post embolization with TLT had P
50
value of 3.09±
0.51, with slope of 4.83±2.74 and n015. Triple TLT treatment
given at 2, 3, and 4 h post embolization has significantly
increased the P
50
to 5.91±0.49, with slope of 9.46±
5.45 and n023, which was a 265 % improvement when
compared with the sham and a 91 % improvement compared
with the single treatment (Fig. 2).
Discussion
Using the RSCEM, we found an effective enhancement of
behavioral outcome with additional treatments of laser therapy
during the acute brain ischemic phase. Such better
outcome was coupled with the total laser energy dose applied
to the animals. There was a 245 % behavioral improvement
compared to the controls when the triple
treatment was applied. Such beneficial incremental

treatment response has not been observed with any neuroprotective
agent tested on the RSCEM, including recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (Table1). We noted
during the experiments that some animals, which were
embolized with very high clot weight, surprisingly survived.
These animals are usually expected to die from clot burden a
few hours after embolization, but when given a triple laser
dose, they had a normal behavior 24 h after the embolization.
In our experience, such treatment response using the
RSCEM has only been observed after treatment with t-PA.
Although the neuroprotective effects of LLLT in acute
brain ischemia are not fully understood, research progress in
cellular and molecular biology has revealed some of its
mechanism of actions. The LLLT is absorbed by the mitochondrial
cytochrome c oxydase causing an upregulation of
the cellular respiratory chain. A host of downstream cellular
responses involving nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species,
adenosine monophosphate, and an increase of ATP ensues,
which ultimately might dictate the LLLT effects [1].
Lapchak et al. using the same RSCEM have confirmed an
increase of ATP production after TLT in the rabbit ischemic
brain [9]. Such increase appears to be energy dosedependent
[9]. However, LLLT studies have also showed a
bell-shaped curve response to light therapy with detrimental
effects at higher energies [1]. High-energy levels could
initiate a bigger increase in ROS and a decrease in mitochondrial
membrane potential, which can induce damage to
the mitochondria and lead to toxicity [15].
It seems plausible that the improvement of the rabbit
behavioral outcome was not only due to the delivery of
higher quantities of LLLT energy, but also by the photostimuation
of different biological events during the ischemic
cascade itself. In general the temporal profile of the main
pathophysiological mechanism underlying the acute focal
brain ischemia begins with cellular bioenergetic failure followed
by excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, blood brain barrier
dysfunction, and post ischemic inflammation [16]. The augmentation
of ATP by LLLT not only provides a bioenergetic
relief, but it can also modulate separate biological reactions.
Several other different mechanisms of LLLT photoactivation
have been postulated. Under hypoxic conditions the
cytochrome c oxidase reduces nitrite to nitric oxide (NO)
[17]. Such reaction is also enhanced by LLLT, increasing the
local production of NO [18] and improving the local cerebral
blood flow in the brain ischemic tissue [19]. Other
ischemic stroke animal models have shown that LLLT also
decreases apoptosis [20], leads to the production of endogenous
neurotrophic factors, and enhances the recovery of
function via neurogenesis [4, 21].
Single TLT dose has shown an improvement of the outcomes
in different animal models [3, 5] and in human
clinical trials [6, 7]. Conversely, in our first set of experiments
, despite the apparent incremental effect of the double
treatment, single laser treatment was not significantly better
than the sham. While there was a considerable variability in
the outcome of the animals within similar clot weight, we
believe that mainly the use lower power density of 7.5 mW/
cm2 accounted for such results. After we observed that a
double TLT irradiation dose safely improved the animal
outcome, we increased the LLLT power settings and reduced
the treatment times for the triple TLT treatment
experiments. The change of the setting for the triple dose
might be considered as a methodological limitation in our
study. However, the decision of changing the settings and
irradiation times was made to obtain a more robust response
of the multiple laser treatments. Yet, our study was not
designed to define the maximal optimal dose of radiation
or the total energy tolerated by the ischemic brain. Neither
did we set out to determine the specific number of treatments
at specific treatment times that could result in optimal
behavioral outcomes. This work is currently planned.
Based on the preliminary data from animal studies and
the successful NEST 1 and 2 studies, the current phase III
clinical trial of TLT, NEST-3, uses a single dose of TLT of
approximately 10 mW/cm2. Based on our results, higher
irradiation settings and multiple treatments could be safely
applied to humans during acute ischemia leading to further
clinical improvement. To move forward to new clinical
trials, our studies need to be replicated, and the questions
raised above have to be addressed in future animal studies.
Conclusions
In the present study, incremental treatments with TLT significantly
improve behavioral outcome in this stroke animal
model. Further studies are needed to improve TLT treatment
times, irradiation, and energy levels for optimal human
acute ischemic stroke TLT treatment.
