Myelin Loss Associated With Neuroinflammation in
Hypertensive Rats
Fakhreya Y. Jalal, PhD; Yi Yang, PhD, MD; Jeffrey Thompson, BS;
Anita C. Lopez, MS; Gary A. Rosenberg, MD
Background and Purpose—Small vessel disease is the major cause of white matter injury in patients with vascular
cognitive impairment. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated inflammation may be involved in the white matter
damage with oligodendrocyte (Ol) death. Therefore, we used spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats to study the
role of neuroinflammation in white matter damage.
Methods—Permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion was performed at 12 weeks of age in spontaneously hypertensive
stroke-prone rats. Following surgery, rats were placed on a Japanese permissive diet and received 1% NaCl in drinking
water. MRI, histology, biochemistry, and ELISA characterized white matter lesions, and cognitive impairment was
tested by Morris water maze.
Results—White matter damage was observed 4 to 5 weeks following permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion/
Japanese permissive diet. Immunoblotting showed marked reduction in myelin basic protein and upregulation of
immature Ols. Mature Ols underwent caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Morris water maze showed cognitive impairment.
Abnormally appearing vessels were observed and surrounded by inflammatory-like cells. IgG extravasation and
hemorrhage, indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, was closely associated with MMP-9 expression. Lesions
in white matter showed reactive astrocytosis and activated microglia that expressed tumor necrosis factor-. MMP-3 and
MMP-9 were significantly increased, and MMP-2 was reduced in both astrocytes and Ol.
Conclusions—We found apoptosis of mature Ols with an increase in immature Ols. Increased MMP-3, MMP-9, and tumor
necrosis factor- were associated with myelin breakdown and BBB disruption. Neuroinflammation is an important
factor in white matter damage and Ol death, and studies using this new model can be performed to assess agents to block
inflammation. (Stroke. 2012;43:1115-1122.)
Key Words: white matter  vascular cognitive impairment  matrix metalloproteinases
Vascular cognitive impairment is a heterogeneous disease
caused by large and small vessel disease.1 White matter
injury is commonly seen in small vessel disease, with arteriolosclerosis secondary to hypertension and diabetes.2 As the
population increases in age, the incidence of vascular causes
of dementia is projected to rise, creating a need for animal
models to elucidate the pathophysiology of white matter
damage and to test treatments.3 Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity
, inflammatory cytokines, and protease activation are
thought to cause oligodendrocyte (Ol) death in acute ischemic
injury, but little is known about the mechanisms of white
matter injury in chronic vascular disease.4 Damage to small
vessels causes an inflammatory response with disruption of
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent accumulation of
fluid and macromolecules in white matter.5 In animal models
of hypoxic hypoperfusion, damage to the white matter is
associated with disruption of the BBB, breakdown of myelin
basic protein (MBP), and Ol cell death.6
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tumor necrosis
factor-(TNF-), which are increased in neuroinflammation,
are implicated in MBP breakdown and Ol death.7,8 Brain
tissues from vascular dementia patients show expression of
MMPs in the regions of white matter damage.9 Vascular
cognitive impairment patients have disruption of the BBB
suggestive of an inflammatory response.10,11 Studies of cerebrospinal
fluid show elevated MMPs.12 In acute ischemia,
there is early elevation of MMP-2.13 Hypoxia-induced MMP-9
expression leads to vascular leakage.14 Knockout of MMP-9
reduces BBB leakage in acute ischemia.15 TNF-production by
microglia has been demonstrated to participate in Ol death in
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.16
Several animal models are used to study vascular cognitive
impairment. Most commonly, bilateral carotid artery occlu-

sion is performed in young normotensive rats, producing
hypoxic hypoperfusion.17 Given that vascular cognitive impairment
patients with white matter damage generally are
older individuals with vascular disease secondary to hypertension
and/or diabetes mellitus, a more appropriate animal
model is an older spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone
rat (SHR-SP). These animals develop extensive white matter
damage with gliosis, apoptosis of Ols, and BBB damage, but
the role of neuroinflammation has not been determined.18 We
hypothesized that white matter injury is a neuroinflammatory
process associated with expression of MMPs and cytokines.
To study the role of inflammation in vascular cognitive
impairment in an animal model, we used a 12-week-old
SHR-SP with a unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO)
and the Japanese permissive diet (JPD) with added salt in the
water. We used MRI to monitor white matter injury and
histological/biochemical studies to identify BBB opening,
myelin loss, and Ol death and expression of neuroinflammatory
proteases and cytokines. A Morris water maze (MWM)
was used to test for cognitive impairment.
Methods
A detailed description of methods is found in the online-only
Supplemental Methods (http://stroke.ahajournals.org).
Animal Groups and Surgery
All protocols followed the guidelines of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the University of New Mexico. SHR-SP
rats were divided into 2 groups: UCAO/JPD and sham-operated.
UCAO, as described in the online-only Supplemental Methods, was
performed on 12-week-old male SHR-SP (Charles River Laboratories
). Following UCAO, rats were placed on a JPD (18.7% protein,
0.63% potassium, 0.37% sodium; Ziegler Bros, Inc) with 1% sodium
chloride added to drinking water for 4 or 5 weeks (end point was
determined based on the appearance of neurological symptoms and
white matter lesions on T2-weighted MRI). In the sham-operated
group, the right carotid artery was isolated, and rats were fed with
regular rodent diet with tap water following this procedure.
Physiological Parameters
Body weight and systolic blood pressure were recorded weekly.
Plasma pH, pO
2
, pCO
2
, glucose, K, and Na levels were also
determined.
Histological Analysis
Klu¨ver-Barrera and hematoxylin eosin staining followed standard
protocols. For immunohistochemistry, brain sections were stained
using anti-MMP-2, anti-MMP-3, anti-MMP-9, anti-glial fibrillary
acidic protein, anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) (CC1), anti-TNF-, anti-Iba-1, and anti-Cy-3-conjugated
affinity pure goat anti-rat IgG antibodies.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
White matter lesions were evaluated using MRI (4.7-T small animal
scanner; Bruker BioSpin) weekly following the UCAO/JPD. Detailed
descriptions of the method were reported previously.19
Immunoblotting
Western blotting followed standard techniques. Primary antibodies
included anti-MBP, anti-GalC, anti-MMP-2, anti-MMP-3, anti-
MMP-9, and anti-active caspase-3.
Evaluation of BBB Permeability by IgG Leakage
We used an ELISA kit (GenWay Biotech, Inc) to measure the levels
of brain tissue IgG.
Morris Water Maze
Three weeks following UCAO/JPD, cognitive function was assessed
as reported previously.20
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as meanSEM. Statistical significance was set at
P0.05. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni modified t test analysis, and unpaired Student t tests,
using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc).
Results
Baseline body weight was similar between UCAO/JPD and
sham-operated groups. The UCAO/JPD group increased in
body weight during the first week, but had a significant
weight loss during weeks 3, 4, and 5 (P0.01). The shamoperated
group gained in body weight throughout the course
of the study (online-only Supplemental Figure S1A).
Systolic blood pressure gradually increased in SHR-SP rats
from 7 to 12 weeks of age, and continued to increase for 4 weeks
post UCAO/JPD; it was significantly different on weeks 3 and 4
compared with the sham group (P0.001, P0.01, respectively
; online-only Supplemental Figure S1B).
Blood chemistry parameters were not significantly different
between groups (online-only Supplemental Table).
Following 4 to 5 weeks of UCAO/JPD, there was a gradual
increase in the number of rats developing neurological deficits
including lethargy, absence of exploration, gait deficit, hemiparesis
, and abnormal circling. T2-weighted images displayed
hyperintense areas in the white matter and hippocampus in both
hemispheres, and unilaterally in the cortex. Sham-operated rats
showed no T2 hyperintensities (Figure 1A).
Myelin loss, using Klu¨ver-Barrera staining, was observed
in the external capsule, corpus callosum, and internal capsule
of both occluded and nonoccluded sides 4 to 5 weeks
following UCAO/JPD (Figure 1B). Most of the myelin loss
occurred in a caudal portion of the brain (approximately2
to6 mm relative to Bregma). This damage was characterized
by increased vacuolation and rarefaction of myelin
fibers. No white matter damage was seen in the shamoperated
group in either hemisphere. Western blot demonstrated
that MBP was significantly decreased in the occluded
side of external capsule and corpus callosum, and in the
nonoccluded hemisphere in external capsule, corpus callosum
, and internal capsule compared with corresponding
controls (P0.05; Figure 1C, D). Immunoblotting with GalC
showed immature Ol increases in all 3 areas of white matter
on the nonoccluded side, and in corpus callosum and internal
capsule of the occluded side (Figure 1C, D).
In MWM, rats that received UCAO/JPD demonstrated
significantly higher escape latencies during the acquisition
trials than did the sham-operated group on days 3 and 4
(P0.01; Figure 2A).
In the probe trial, in which the platform was removed, rats
were required to recall the location of the platform in the
northwest quadrant, relying on distal cues. Rats in the shamoperated
group had intact memory, evidenced by greater time
spent in the northwest quadrant, whereas the UCAO/JPD group
spent significantly less time, revealing memory impairments
(P0.01; Figure 2B).

Swimming speeds during 4 days of the acquisition trial were
similar (Figure 2C), indicating that deficits in performance by
the UCAO/JPD group were not because of poor motor function.
In addition, there were no group differences in latencies to find
a platform with a visual cue, indicating that visual function was
normal after UCAO/JPD (Figure 2D).
White matter IgG content was observed within the area of
external capsule and within the corpus callosum of the
occluded side. Extravasations of IgG were also demonstrated
in the regions of external capsule, corpus callosum, and
internal capsule of the nonoccluded side using ELISA (Figure
3A). In addition, MMP-9 was detected in the area of IgG
leakage (Figure 3B). MMP-3 was not detected (data not
shown). H&E staining showed hemorrhage and perivascular
infiltrates of inflammatory-like cells. There was loss of structure
in the white matter surrounding the vessels (Figure 3C).
Western blot showed that MMP-2 was present in both
latent and active forms and was identified in both sham-

operated and UCAO/JPD groups. MMP-2 was decreased in
the external capsule on the nonoccluded side following
UCAO/JPD (P0.05), with no change detected on the
occluded side (Figure 4A, B). We detected MMP-3 proform
in both groups on both sides (Figure 4A, B). Western blot
analysis showed a significant increase in the expression of
proMMP-3 in areas of external capsule, corpus callosum, and
internal capsule in occluded (P0.05) and external capsule in
nonoccluded brain hemispheres (P0.01). ProMMP-9 was
significantly greater in external capsule, corpus callosum, and
internal capsule of the UCAO/JPD group on both sides when
compared with the sham-operated group (Figure 4A, B).
Strong colocalization of MMP-3 and MMP-9 immunoreactivity
with glial fibrillary acidic protein and CC1 was observed
(Figure 4C). No colocalization was observed with
OX-42 (data not shown), suggesting that astrocytes and Ols
are important sources of MMP-3 and MMP-9.
Confocal immunohistochemisty images exhibited many
cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in the area of external
capsule, colocalized with CC1, suggesting that these Ols were
undergoing apoptosis (Figure 5A). Western blot analysis
demonstrated increased cleaved caspase-3 in the areas of
external capsule, corpus callosum, and internal capsule of
both hemispheres (Figure 5B and C). The sham-operated
group showed little cleaved caspase-3. Glial fibrillary acidic
protein-positive cells were distributed throughout white matter
and hippocampus (online-only Supplemental Figure S2A).
TNF- was increased in white matter and was colocalized
with Iba-1-positive microglia/macrophages (online-only Supplemental
Figure S2B).
Discussion
This hypertensive rat model has damage to the white matter
similar pathologically to that seen in vascular cognitive
impairment patients. Our results indicate that inflammation
with MMPs and TNF- expression is associated with astrogliosis
and death of mature Ols. At 12 weeks of age, the
SHR-SP were fed the JPD with salt in the drinking water and
had a unilateral carotid occlusion. After 4 to 5 weeks, we
found death of mature Ols, proliferation of immature Ols,

breakdown of MBP, and opening of the BBB that was
associated with an increase in MMPs. Memory impairment
was demonstrated by MWM by week 3 following UCAO/
JPD. Mature Ols expressed cleaved caspase-3, suggesting
apoptosis. We observed an inflammatory response after
UCAO/JPD that resulted in the expression of TNF- in
microglia and in increased expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9
in reactive astrocytes and Ols. MMP-9 colocalized with
regions where the BBB was disrupted, as shown by IgG
extravasation. These results support the hypothesis that inflammation
is involved in white matter damage.
Although only 1 carotid was ligated, MRI showed white
matter lesions in both hemispheres. A prior study in young,
normotensive rats used bilateral occlusion of the carotids to
induce white matter damage.21When we attempted to occlude
both carotids in the 12-week-old SHR-SP, death occurred
within 24 hours (data not shown). However, with occlusion of
only 1 side, not only did the rats survive, but the injury pattern
was apparent in both hemispheres, providing a model pathologically
consistent with vascular cognitive impairment.
Damage to the nonoccluded hemisphere was greater than that
seen in the occluded hemisphere. A previous study demonstrated
that wall-to-lumen ratios of arteries from chronically
hypertensive rats revert to those of normotensive rats when
the vessels are ligated.22 Additional study will be needed to
clarify the mechanism of apparent protection on the occluded
side.
Extensive myelin disruption with marked decrease in MBP
was seen by 4 weeks after the start of the diet and unilateral
carotid occlusion. Ols showed increased expression of
cleaved caspase-3 that colocalized with CC1. Mature Ols
were targeted for cell death as revealed by the loss of the
MBP, whereas immature Ols increased in number as shown
by GalC. The damage to the myelin could have been caused
by a direct attack by the MMPs or loss of Ols leading to
breakdown of the myelin sheath. The colocalization of
MMP-9 with IgG supports its involvement in BBB disruption.
MMP-3 was increased in cells close to the damaged
myelin, but not in the vicinity of blood vessels. Our recent
study supports the role of MMP-3 and MMP-9 in Ol death
following cerebral ischemia.7 MMP-2, including pro- and
active forms, was decreased, suggesting that MMP-2 may
have been consumed. Thus, whereas MMP-3 and/or MMP-9
are most likely involved in the damage, MMP-2 may have
contributed as well.15,23
Our finding of extensive white matter damage in the SHR-SP
with UCAO and JPD resemble the findings in pathological
studies in vascular cognitive impairment patients with small

vessel disease.24,25 The SHR-SP were studied between age 12
and 16 weeks, making them a more relevant model for the
human disease, which is seen mainly in older patients. Studies in
human tissues show disruption of the BBB with expression of
MMP-2 in reactive astrocytes and MMP-3 in pericytes.9MMP-3
and MMP-9 are increased in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with
vascular cognitive impairment.12,26
Other injury pathways have been implicated in apoptotic
death of Ols, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, or glutamate
toxicity.27 Previous studies demonstrated independent tim-

ing and mechanisms of Ol death versus demyelination,28 which
cannot be determined in our model. In demyelinating transgenic
mice, MMP-3 triggered neuroinflammation with microglial
induction of TNF-,29,30 and MMP-3 upregulation preceded the
onset of disease.31 Release of MMP-3 from apoptotic neurons
activated microglia and induced inflammatory cytokines, suggesting
that MMP-3 may be a signaling molecule in neuronal
apoptosis.29 TNF- and interleukin-1 produced a significant
increase in the production of MMP-3 and MMP-9 in cultured
astrocytes and microglia. Our data demonstrate that an increase
in the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9 parallel increased
microglial reactivity, TNF- expression, and eventual apoptotic
death of Ols.
Hypertensive rats exhibiting white matter damage showed
memory deficits in the MWM test by the third week after the
UCAO/JPD, which was shown to be unrelated to either visual
or motor deficits. In addition, microglial activation that has
been observed in the white matter in the present study may be
involved in cognitive impairment. Given that the hippocampus
was involved in the injury, we cannot exclude a contribution
to the memory loss from hippocampal damage, which
we plan to explore in future studies.
In conclusion, we have described a model of white matter
damage in SHR-SP that has similarities to the hypertensive,
small vessel form of vascular cognitive impairment seen in
older patients. Our data show an inflammatory response,
involving expression of MMPs and TNF- with BBB opening
and demyelination. This animal model combines the
major features of small vessel vascular cognitive impairment
and it exhibits not only myelin and Ol loss, but also cognitive

impairment. The expression of MMPs and TNF- in the
regions of inflammatory damage to the BBB and Ols is
consistent with earlier studies, but it will have to be confirmed
by blocking their action with inhibitors of MMPs.
Because of its unique similarities to vascular cognitive
impairment, this is a potential model for the study of agents
to reduce the inflammatory response and slow progression of
white matter damage.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Myelin loss associated with neuroinflammation in hypertensive rats
Supplemental Methods:
1-Unilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion in SHR-SP
Rats were deeply anesthetized with 2.0 % isoflurane. A heating pad was used to maintain body 
temperature at 37 ± 0.05 oC. Under a surgical microscope, a ventral midline incision was made to 
expose  the  right  carotid  artery.  After  isolation,  the  right  carotid  artery  was  double-ligated 
permanently with 4-0 silk sutures. 
2-Body Weight and Systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement
The  body  weight  of  both  experimental  and  sham  operated  rats  was  measured before 
UCAO/JPD. Weekly measures were made for 4 weeks following UCAO/JPD for both sham and 
experimental groups. 
SBP was measured for UCAO/JPD and its sham-operated group by tail-cuff non-invasive 
blood pressure measurements using the CODA system (Kent Scientific Inc.). SBP was measured 
starting  week 7 and  through to  16 weeks  of  age in  awake  rats  that  were  habituated  to  this 
procedure.  For  every  data point,  seven  measurements  were  performed  and mean  values  were 
calculated. 
3-Blood collection for the measurement of blood parameters
During a brief 2 % isoflurane induced anesthesia, venous blood was withdrawn from the 
orbital  sinus  of  rats  using  heparinized  capillary  tubes  one  week  before  UCAO/JPD,  and  then 
every week for 4 weeks. Eye lubricant was applied to prevent corneal ulceration. At each time

point  the  following  parameters  in  blood  samples  were  measured:      pH,  pCO2,  pO2,  glucose 
concentration (Glu), and concentration of electrolytes: K+, and Na+ (iSTAT CG8 + Cartridge and 
the iSTAT analyzer, Abaxis and Heska Corporation).
4-Tissue preparation for Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting
Rats  were  anesthetized  with  pentobarbital  (50  mg/kg, i.p)  and  transcardially  perfused 
with 0.1 % procaine in cold phosphate buffer followed by 2 % PLP (2 % paraformaldehyde, 0.1 
M sodium periodate, 75 mM lysine in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Brains were 
removed  and  post-fixed  in  2  %  PLP  for  24  hours  at  4 oC.  For  cryosectioning,  tissues  were 
cryoprotected in  30 % sucrose/2 % PLP at  4 oC, and placed in  a Peel-A-Way histology mold 
(Ted Pella Inc.) containing Tissue-Tek embedding medium (OCT; Sakura Finetek). Tissue was 
frozen in 2-methylbutane cooled in liquid nitrogen.  Brains were kept at – 80 oC until use. Brain 
tissues  were  sectioned  at  10 m  prior  to  histological  analysis.  For  immunoblotting,  rats  were 
perfused with ice cold saline, brains were removed quickly, frozen in – 80 oC 2-methylbutane, 
then kept at – 80 oC until use.
5-Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Brain sections were dried for 20 min followed by incubation with ice cold acetone for 10 
min.  This  was  followed  by  two  washes  in  tap  water,  and  then  slides  were  placed  in  PBS 
containing  1 % Tween  20 (PBST) for 15 min.  Blocking buffer containing 5 % normal  serum 
(Invitrogen)  was  used  to  block  nonspecific  binding  for  30  min.  After  blocking,  slides  were 
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 oC. After 24 hr, slides were washed three times 
with PBST (6 min each). Secondary antibodies, conjugated to FITC or Cy-3 (Alexafluor 488 or 
Alexafluor  546;  Invitrogen),  were  applied  for  90  min  at  room  temperature.  Slides  then  were 
washed in PBST and were incubated with 4-6-diamidino-2-phenyllinidole (DAPI; Invitrogen) to

label  cell  nuclei.  Primary  antibodies  and  dilutions  used  for  IHC  were  as  follows:  rabbit  anti-
MMP-2  (Chemicon;  1:200),  rabbit  anti-MMP-3  (Chemicon;  1:175),    rabbit  anti-MMP-9 
(Chemicon; 1:175), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:400; Sigma), rabbit anticleaved
 caspase-3  (Cell  Signaling;  1:200),  Cy-3-conjugated  Affinity  Pure  Goat  Anti-Rat  IgG 
(Jackson  Immuno  Research  Laboratories,  Inc.;  1:50), mouse  anti-TNF- (15 g/ml;  R&D 
Systems), and mouse anti-APC (CC1;12 g/ml; Calbiochem). To detect co-localization, double 
immunofluorescence was performed for MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, with specific cell markers, 
including  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP;  marker  of  reactive  astrocytes), and CC1  (a 
marker of mature oligodendrocytes. In addition, cleaved caspase-3 was also co-labeled with CC1 
and a marker of microglia/macrophages (Iba-1) was co-localized with TNF-. Negative controls 
were incubated without the primary antibodies or with normal (nonimmune) IgGs from the host 
species of the primary antibodies and did not exhibit specific immunolabeling (data not shown).
6-Immunoblotting
Frozen coronal sections were cut at 400 um thickness and micropunched biopsies were 
collected  from  both  brain  hemispheres  in  white matter  areas  of external  capsule, corpus 
callosum, and internal capsule at – 25oC. Tissues were homogenized in  RIPA lysis buffer (50 
mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,1 % NP-40, 1 % sodium Deoxycholate, and 0.5 % SDS) 
with protease inhibitor cocktail (10 ul/ml; Pierce) and centrifuged (12000 rpm, 10 minutes, 4°C). 
Protein concentration in the homogenates was determined by the Micro BCA protein Assay kit 
(Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (30 g) were separated by electrophoresis on 4-20 % SDS-
polyacrylamide gels  (Bio-Rad  Labs).  Proteins  were  transferred  to  a  polyvinylidene  fluoride 
membrane (Millipore). Membranes were then blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered 
saline containing 1 % Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour.  Membranes were then incubated in mouse

monoclonal  anti-GalC  (Chemicon;  1:500),  rabbit  polyclonal  anti  MBP  (Chemicon;  1:3000), 
rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-2 (Chemicon; 1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-MMP-3 (Epitomics; 
1:1000),  rabbit  monoclonal  anti-MMP-9  (Epitomics;  1:1000),  or  rabbit  polyclonal  anti-active 
caspase-3 (Abcam; 1:1000) primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 oC. Membranes 
were  then  washed  four  times  for  5  min  each  in  TBST.  Membranes were  incubated  with 
horseradish  peroxidase-linked  secondary  antibodies  in  blocking  buffer  for  1 hour, after  which 
they were washed 3 times 15 min each in TBST, all at room temperature. Bands were visualized 
by using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) which was used for MBP, 
MMP-2,  MMP-3,  MMP-9,  and cleaved  caspase-3.  For  GalC,  10  % SuperSignal  West  Femto 
Substrate was added to West Pico detection reagent for a better visualization of this antibody. 
Equal  protein  loading  was  determined  using  rabbit  anti-actin  IgG  (Sigma-Aldrich;  1:7500).  
Protein  bands  were  visualized  on  X-ray  film. Optical  density  of  bands  was  quantified  using 
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
7-Evaluation of BBB Permeability by IgG Leakage 
White matter samples from external capsule, corpus callosum, and internal capsule and 
standards were incubated in 96-micro well plate which was coated with affinity purified anti-Rat 
IgG  antibodies.  IgG  present  in  samples  or  standard  reacts  with  the  anti-IgG  antibodies  which 
have been adsorbed to the surface of the well bottoms. After removal of unbound proteins by 
washing, anti-IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), were added. Anti-
IgG-HRP antibodies formed complexes with previously bound IgG. Following detection using 
the  chromogenic  substrate,  3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine  (TMB),  the  concentration  of  IgG  in 
samples were measured by spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm and quantified relative 
to standards.

8-Morris Water Maze
Spatial learning and memory were tested on experiment week 3. The Morris water maze 
consists of a circular pool (180 cm in diameter and 60 cm high), which was virtually separated 
into four quadrants (NW, SW, NE, and SE) and was filled with opaque water at a temperature of 
22.0 1.0 oC. A plexiglas escape platform was submerged 1.5 cm below the water surface at a 
fixed  location  (North  West  quadrant;  NWQ)  in  the pool.  The  pool  was  located  in  a  room 
containing several extramaze location cues. In the acquisition phase, rats were given 4 trials each 
day for 4 consecutive days. In each trial rats were placed in the tank facing the edge at one of 
three random starting positions (SW, SE, or NE), with no two successive trials from the same 
starting position. Rats were allowed to swim until they found the platform or for 60 sec if they 
failed to  find it. Once the rat  located the platform, it was  allowed to  remain on it for 30 sec. 
During this phase rats learned to navigate to the hidden platform during each 60 sec trial session. 
If a rat failed to reach the platform it was guided to platform and was allowed to remain on it for 
30 sec. The time each rat took to locate the platform, and the average swim speed were recorded 
and analyzed with a video camera and ANY-maze (Version 4.70) computerized software from 
San Diego Instruments. Twenty four hours after the final trial a probe trial was performed, in 
which the platform was removed and the rat was allowed to swim for 60 sec in the pool. The 
time  the  rat  spent  in  the NWQ,  former  location  of  the  platform, was  recorded.  Following  the 
probe  trial a  cue  test  was  performed  to  determine  whether  the  animals  had  any  vision 
impairments. In this test the platform was raised, a colored ball was placed on it, and the time the 
rat took to reach the platform was recorded for 60 sec.

Images  for  Klüver-Barrera,  H  &  E, microglia/TNF-,  astocytes, IgG/MMP-9  were 
acquired  using  Olympus  BX-51  bright  field  and  fluorescence  microscope  (Olympus  America 
Inc.)  equipped  with  an  Optronics  digital  camera  and  Picture  Frame  image  capture  software 
(Optronics). Confocal images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss 
LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Microimaging) to confirm co-labeling.
