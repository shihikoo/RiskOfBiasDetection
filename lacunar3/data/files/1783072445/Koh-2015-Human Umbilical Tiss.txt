Cell therapy demonstrates great potential for the treatment of neurological disorders. Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTCs)
werepreviouslyshowntohaveprotectiveandregenerativeeffectsinanimalmodelsofstrokeandretinaldegeneration,buttheunderlying
therapeutic mechanisms are unknown. Because synaptic dysfunction, synapse loss, degeneration of neuronal processes, and neuronal
death are hallmarks of neurological diseases and retinal degenerations, we tested whether hUTCs contribute to tissue repair and regeneration
by stimulating synapse formation, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival. To do so, we used a purified rat retinal ganglion cell
culture system and found that hUTCs secrete factors that strongly promote excitatory synaptic connectivity and enhance neuronal
survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that hUTCs support neurite outgrowth under normal culture conditions and in the presence of
the growth-inhibitory proteins chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, myelin basic protein, or Nogo-A (reticulon 4). Furthermore, through

Introduction
Cell therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of neurological
disorders. Transplanted cells are thought to promote recovery
and neuroprotection by replacing the damaged cells or by
providing trophic factors that enhance neural health and regeneration
(Rao and Mattson, 2001;Lindvall and Kokaia, 2010;Popovich
, 2012; Doeppner and Hermann, 2014; Atala, 2015). The
umbilical cord is a commonly used cell source for therapeutic
purposes due to ease of accessibility without ethical concerns.
Several studies report that umbilical cord blood-derived cells can
be potentially useful for the treatment of various types of neuro- Received April 9, 2015; revised Sept. 17, 2015; accepted Oct. 15, 2015.

Significance Statement
Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTC) are currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of geographic atrophy
secondary to age-related macular degeneration. These cells show great promise for the treatment of neurological disorders;
however, the therapeutic effects of these cells on CNS neurons are not fully understood. Here we provide compelling evidence that
hUTCs secrete multiple factors that work synergistically to enhance synapse formation and function, and support neuronal
growth and survival. Moreover, we identified thrombospondins (TSPs) as the hUTC-secreted factors that mediate the synaptogenicandgrowth-promotingfunctionsofthesecells.OurfindingshighlightnovelparacrineeffectsofhUTConCNSneuronhealth

degeneration (Lee et al., 2010,2012;Park et al., 2012;Rowe et al.,
2012;Achyut et al., 2014).
An alternative source of therapeutic cells is the umbilical tissue
itself. Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTCs) are
isolated from whole cord tissue, devoid of blood, and are currently
under clinical investigation for the treatment of geographic
atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration
(NCT01226628). These cells are karyotypically stable during in
vitroculture (Lund et al., 2007), ensuring safety upon their transplantation.
hUTCs are distinct from umbilical cord bloodderived
cells as they do not express CD31 or CD45 (Lund et al.,
2007), cell surface markers that are highly expressed on cord
blood cells (Lund et al., 2007;Achyut et al., 2014).
The therapeutic potential of hUTC administration was demonstrated
in various animal disease models (Lund et al., 2007;
Zhang et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Jiang et al., 2012; Moore et al.,
2013). Delivery of hUTCs into animal models of stroke (Zhang et
al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Jiang et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013) and
retinal degeneration (Lund et al., 2007) has shown that these cells
enhance functional recovery and protect neurons from progressive
degeneration. The lifespan of the transplanted cells varies
with transplantation sites and methods, but the beneficial effects
of the cells were measured 8–12 weeks after treatment (Lund et
al., 2007;Jiang et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2012,2013).
Paracrine factors secreted by hUTCs, such as growth factors, cytokines
, and chemokines, are thought to promote the therapeutic
effects of these cells. Several hUTC-secreted growth factors with general
neuroprotective effects have been identified, such as brainderived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-6 (Lund et al.,
2007;Alder et al., 2012); however, the underlying therapeutic mechanisms
of hUTCs are still unclear.
In this study, we investigated the direct effects of hUTC-
secreted factors on CNS neurons. We postulated that hUTCs
could enhance neuronal structure and function by promoting
synaptic connectivity, supporting neuronal outgrowth, and sustaining
neuronal survival. To examine this possibility, we used an
in vitro purified primary neuronal culture system of rat retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) isolated from 7-day-old rat pups. This allowed
us to dissect out the hUTC–neuron interactions that control
different aspects of neuronal health. We found that hUTCs
secrete factors that directly enhance neuronal survival, strongly
trigger synapse formation, and promote neurite outgrowth.
Purified RGC cultures have been extensively used to determine
themolecularmechanismsthatpromoteneuronalsurvivalandneurite
outgrowth (Barres et al., 1988;Meyer-Franke et al., 1995;Goldberg
and Barres, 2000). Moreover, this culture system was critical in
elucidating that astrocytes secrete signals that control synapse formation
between neurons (Pfrieger and Barres, 1997; Mauch et al.,
2001;Ullian et al., 2001;Christopherson et al., 2005;Kucukdereli et
al., 2011;Allen et al., 2012). Thrombospondin (TSP) family proteins
TSP1 and TSP2 were identified as the necessary and sufficient
astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic proteins that promote a strong increase
in excitatory synapses made between RGCs (Christopherson
etal.,2005)viatheirinteractionswiththeneuronalreceptor,calcium
channel subunit 2-1 (Eroglu et al., 2009). Here we found that
hUTCs secrete TSP family members TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4, which
are essential for the ability of these cells to promote synapse formation
and neurite outgrowth.
Materials and Methods
Isolation and culture of primary rat RGCs and astrocytes.All experiments
were conducted in accordance with the institutional animal care and use
committee guidelines (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
Protocols A-185-11-08 and A-173-14-07). RGCs were purified by sequential
immunopanning from P7 (postnatal day 7) Sprague Dawley rat
retinas (Charles River) of either sex as previously described (Winzeler
and Wang, 2013). Briefly, retinas were dissected and dissociated with
papain (6 U/ml, Worthington). Dissociated cells were panned first with
Bandeiraea Simplicifolia Lectin I (Vector Laboratories)-coated Petri
dishes to remove immune cells, cell debris, and fibroblasts. The unbound
cellsweretransferredtoaPetridishcoatedwithanti-Thy1(cloneT11D7)
antibody for specific isolation of RGCs. The purified RGCs were gently
trypsinized and replated onto poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated glass
coverslips in 24-well plates (35,000 cells/coverslip). RGCs were cultured
in a serum-free growth medium containing B27 (Invitrogen), BDNF,
ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin, and forskolin (for full recipe
of the media, seeWinzeler and Wang, 2013).
Cortical astrocytes were isolated from P1 Sprague Dawley rat pups of
either sex using standard methods as described previously (McCarthy
and de Vellis, 1980). For astrocyte coculture, transwell inserts (BD Biosciences
) were prepared by seeding 125,000 cortical astrocytes per insert
in astrocyte growth media (described byMcCarthy and de Vellis, 1980).
The next day, astrocyte growth media were replaced with RGC growth
media, and the transwell inserts were transferred into the 24-well plate
containing the 4 DIV RGCs on coverslips.
hUTC preparation.Human umbilical cords were obtained with donor
consent following live births. Tissues were minced and enzymatically
digested. After almost complete digestion with DMEM-low glucose (Lg)
(SAFC Biosciences) containing a mixture of 0.5 U/ml collagenase (Serva
Electrophoresis), 5 U/ml neutral protease (Serva Electrophoresis), and 2
U/ml hyaluronidase (Cumulase; Origio), the cell suspension was filtered
through a 70m filter, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 250g.
Isolated cells were washed in DMEM-Lg several times and plated at a
density of 5000 cells/cm2in DMEM-Lg containing 15% (v/v) FBS (SAFC
Biosciences) (5% carbon dioxide, 37°C). When cells reached70% confluence
(3–4 d), they were passaged using TrypLE (Invitrogen). Cells
were expanded several times and banked. Cryopreserved hUTCs (16–20
population doublings) were used for the present study.
Normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) preparation. NHDFs, Passage
1 (adult skin) were obtained from Lonza. Cells were expanded and
cryopreserved at Passage 4, according to the manufacture’s protocol.
Coculture experiments.For coculture experiments, 25,000 hUTCs were
seeded into transwell inserts in hUTC growth media a day before the
coculture with RGCs. This seeding density was optimal for hUTCs because
higher seeding densities led to overconfluence. On the day of coculture
, the hUTC growth media were replaced with RGC growth media,
and transwell inserts were transferred into the 24-well plates with 4 DIV
RGCs that are grown on glass coverslips.
NHDFs were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (Lonza) using manufacturer
’s recommendations. For coculture with RGCs, 150,000
NHDFs were seeded into transwell inserts in fibroblast basal media
day before the coculture with RGCs. The next day, fibroblast basal
media were replaced with RGC growth media, and the transwell inserts
were transferred into the 24-well plate containing the 4 DIV
RGCs on coverslips.
Preparation of conditioned media. Pure astrocyte cultures or hUTCs
were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes (Corning) in their own growth
media until they were 70% confluent. Cells were then washed twice with
warm DPBS (Invitrogen), and 10 ml of conditioning media, which is
composed of Neurobasal (Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine
(2 mM, Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate (1 mM, Invitrogen), penicillin (100
U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml, Invitrogen), was added to each
dish. Media were conditioned by cells for 5 d. Cell-free conditioned
media were collected and concentrated 10 times using 5 kDa molecular
weight cutoff Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius). The protein
concentration of each conditioned medium was measured by the

Aliquots of astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) and
hUTC-conditioned media (UCM) in low protein-binding tubes (Eppendorf
) were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at80°C until
use. To fractionate UCM with different molecular weight cutoffs 30 and
100 kDa, Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrators were used. To collect
5–100 kDa UCM fractions, flow-through of 100 kDa Vivaspin 20 was
concentrated with 5 kDa Vivaspin 20 concentrators. For treatments, frozen
aliquots were allowed to slowly melt on ice, and conditioned media
were added into ice-cold RGC growth media (synapse and outgrowth
assays) or minimal media (survival assays) at the desired concentrations.
Quantification of synapse number by immunocytochemistry (synapse
assay).To test the effects of hUTC coculture or UCM on synaptogenesis,
35,000 RGCs were cultured alone on glass coverslips for 4 DIV and transwell
inserts or conditioned media were added on 4 DIV. To block TSP-
induced synapse formation, 32Mgabapentin (GBP) was added together
with the conditioned media as described previously (Eroglu et al., 2009).
The cocultured cells received fresh growth media on 7 DIV. When conditioned
media were used, growth media supplemented with conditioned
media were provided at 7 DIV. On 10 DIV, RGCs were fixed with
4% PFA (w/v) and stained for presynaptic and postsynaptic markers

Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories) on glass slides (VWR Scientific). RGCs were imaged
on a Zeiss Axioimager M1 Epifluorescence Microscope (Carl Zeiss)
using a 63 objective. Morphologically healthy single cells that were at
least two cell diameters from their nearest neighbor were identified randomly
by DAPI fluorescence. At least 15–20 cells per condition were
imaged and analyzed per experiment, and the results presented are the
average of two or three independent experiments. Captured images were
analyzed for colocalized synaptic puncta with a custom plug-in (written

of Health image-processing package ImageJ. Thedetails of the staining
protocol and the quantification method are described previously

(Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010). Synaptic densities (number of synapses per
neurite length) were determined by counting the number of colocalized
synaptic puncta per 100m dendrite. For this analysis, one proximal dendrite
/cell was randomly chosen per image. The synaptic density results presented
are from one experiment with 30 cells/condition.
Electrophysiological recordings from RGCs.Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs)
were recorded by whole-cell patch clamp at a holding potential of70
mV. The cells were maintained under continuous perfusion of the

NaCl, 10 mMtetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mMHEPES, 4 mMlidocaine N-ethyl bromide, 1.1 mM EGTA, 4 mM magnesium ATP, and 0.3
mM sodium GTP, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH and osmolality set to
300 mOsm with sucrose. Signals were recorded by MultiClamp 700B
amplifier (Molecular Devices) and filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20
kHz with a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). In the wholecell
configuration, recordings were only accepted when the series resistance
is20 M. All data were analyzed using peak detection software in
pCLAMP10 (Molecular Devices). Data presented are acquired from 15
cells/condition that were recorded3 independent experiments.
Neurite outgrowth assay.The RGCs were plated onto poly-D-lysine and
mouse laminin (20 ng/ml)-coated glass coverslips at low density (1500
cells/coverslip) for 24 h and then were fixed with 4% PFA (w/v) and
immunostained with rabbit anti- tubulin antibody (LI-COR, RRID:
AB_1850029), followed with goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488 to visualize
the neurites. To test neurite outgrowth under pathological (i.e., growthinhibiting
) culture conditions, the RGCs (1500 cells/coverslip) were
plated onto coverslips that were coated with various concentrations of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG, EMD Millipore), Nogo-A
(R&D Systems), or in the presence of soluble myelin basic protein (MBP,
10g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 h, neurites were visualized by incubating
with CellTracker Red CMPTX dye (Invitrogen) for 15 min followed
by fixation with 4% PFA (w/v). Images of single RGCs with their
neurites were captured using a 20objective on a Zeiss Axioimager M1
Epifluorescence Microscope (Carl Zeiss). At least 30 cells per condition
were imaged and analyzed per experiment, and the results presented are
the average of two or three independent experiments. Neuronal morphology
was analyzed using neurite outgrowth application module in
MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Sholl analysis was performed
using a plug-in for Fiji as described previously (Ferreira et al., 2014).
Survival assay. For survival assays, RGCs were plated directly onto
24-well tissue culture plates (7500 cells/well). Wells were coated with
poly-D-lysine and laminin. Cells were cultured in a minimal media containing
Neurobasal (Invitrogen), SATO supplement (100 g/ml transferrin
, 100g/ml BSA, 60 ng/ml progesterone, 16g/ml putrescine, 40
ng/ml sodium selenite),N-acetylcysteine (5g/ml), triiodothyronine (4
g/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100
g/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and forskolin (5M). To test the effects
of UCM and ACM on survival, the minimal media were supplemented
with various concentrations of conditioned media in the absence/presence
of forskolin, BDNF (200 ng/ml), or CNTF (40 ng/ml) The cell
viability was assessed at 3 DIV by using the LIVE/DEAD Viability Kit for
mammalian cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The viability counts were performed 15 min after the application of the
kit agents, and representative images were captured with Zeiss Axio Observer
A1 Epifluorescence Microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a 20objective.
At least 10 fields per treatment were counted in each experiment, and the
results presented are an average of two or three experiments. Percentage
survival was calculated as the number of live cells divided by the total of
number of dead and live cells100.
Production of lentivirus for TSP knockdown. shRNA construct pools
cloned into pLKO.1-puro vectors that target humanTHBS1,THBS2,or

purchased from Addgene (plasmid 8453) and used as knockdown control.
Knockdown efficiency of individual constructs was determined by
transfection into hUTCs. An shRNA construct for each TSP that demonstrated
the most effective knockdown was chosen for subsequent lentivirus
production.
To make the lentivirus, 293T lentiviral-packaging cells were seeded at

Results
hUTC-secreted factors induce functional synapse formation
To determine whether the hUTCs secrete synaptogenic factors
, we investigated the changes in the number and function
of synapses made between purified RGCs when they were
cocultured with hUTCs in transwell inserts. RGCs cocultured
with primary rat astroglial cultures (ASCs) provided a positive
control in this assay because astrocytes are known to strongly
increase synapse numbers and enhance synaptic activity (Pfrieger
and Barres, 1997;Ullian et al., 2001). On the other hand,
RGCs treated with NHDF provided a negative control because
they did not induce significant functional or structural recovery
in a model of retinal degeneration (Lund et al., 2007). After
4 DIV, RGCs were cocultured with hUTCs, ASCs, or NHDF
for an additional 6 d, and the number of synapses was assessed
by immunostaining with a pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic
proteins: bassoon and homer, respectively (Fig. 1A). Synapses
were determined as the colocalization of presynaptic and
postsynaptic markers using methods described previously (Ippolito
and Eroglu, 2010) ( Fig. 1B, arrows). We found that,
similar to ASCs, hUTCs strongly induce the formation of excitatory
synapses between RGCs compared with RGCs cultured
alone (Fig. 1B,C, one-way ANOVA, p  0.0001).
Coculture with NHDF did not induce a significant increase in
synapse number (Fig. 1B,C, one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001).
Quantification of the number of synapses per unit neurite
length revealed that hUTCs enhance synapse numbers primarily
by increasing the synapse density (Fig. 1D, one-way
ANOVA, p 0.0001).
To determine how hUTCs affect synaptic function, we performed
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure the
mEPSCs. RGCs were either cultured alone or in the presence of
hUTCs or ASCs (Fig. 1A). Similar to astrocytes, coculture of
RGCs with hUTCs led to a significant increase in the frequency
of the synaptic events (Fig. 2A–C, Kruskal–Wallis test, p 
0.0001; Fig. 2C, one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001), which is in line
with the robust increase we observed in the number of synapses
(Fig. 1B–D). hUTCs also significantly increased the amplitude of
potsynaptic currents demonstrating that, like astrocytes, hUTCs
strengthen synaptic activity (Fig. 2D, Kruskal–Wallis test, p
0.0001). Together, these results show that hUTCs can induce
excitatory synapse formation and enhance synaptic function in
cultured RGCs, similar to ASCs.
To confirm that the synaptogenic effect of hUTCs is mediated
via secreted factors and to determine whether secretion of these
synaptogenic signals requires any feedback from neurons, we cultured
hUTCs alone and collected UCM (Fig. 3A). We then
treated RGCs with UCM and assessed the effect of conditioned
media on synapse number and function using the same assays as
inFigure 1(Fig. 3A). We found that addition of UCM is sufficient
to induce synapse formation similar to the hUTCs in transwell
inserts (Fig. 3B–D, one-way ANOVA,p0.0001). UCM’s effect

on synaptogenesis was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3B,C,
each pair Student’sttest,p0.0001). UCM exerted its full synaptogenic
activity at concentrations between 20 and 80g total
protein/ml culture media. In addition, mEPSCs recording of
RGCs treated with UCM demonstrated significant increase in the
frequency of the synaptic events (Fig. 4A–C, Kruskal–Wallis test,
p0.0001;Fig. 4C, one-way ANOVA,p0.0001) and the amplitude
of postsynaptic currents (Fig. 4D,E, Kruskal–Wallis test, p
0.0001) comparable with ACM (positive control). These results
show that hUTCs induce synapse formation through soluble secreted
factors. Because UCM can work as efficiently as hUTC coculture
, feedback from neurons, which can only be provided during
coculture, is not necessary for this function of hUTCs.
Together, our results demonstrate that hUTCs strongly
induce synapse formation and enhance synaptic function via
secreted factors. These results suggest that the powerful synaptogenic
effect of hUTCs may contribute to the functional
recovery that is induced by the delivery of these cells to animal
disease models.
UCM contain factors that promote RGC survival and
neurite outgrowth
In addition to the functional recovery that was observed after
hUTC transplantations, previous studies in animal disease models
revealed a strong effect of these cells on the preservation of the
neural structures (Lund et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011, 2012;
Jiang et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013). Therefore, using the RGC
culture system, we next examined the effects of UCM on neuronal
survival and neurite outgrowth. To assay for the survivalpromoting
activity of the UCM, RGCs were cultured for 3 DIV in
a minimal media, which lacked the media supplement B27 and
growth factors BDNF, CNTF, and insulin, butcontained forskolin
(referredasCTRforminimalmediacontrolcondition).Underthese
minimal media conditions,5% of the RGCs survive at the end of 3

DIV (Fig. 5A, left,B). Addition of growth factors, such as BDNF or
CNTF, only in the presence of forskolin, significantly increases RGC
survival (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995). We found that addition of
UCM into minimal media strongly stimulated RGC survival in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, right, B, one-way
ANOVA, p 0.0001). Interestingly, ACM did not promote RGC
survival at the same concentrations (Fig. 5B).
Previous studies demonstrated that neurotrophic factors,
such as BDNF, CNTF, and IGF-1, support RGC survival albeit
only when forskolin is present (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995). Forskolin
in the culture media increases cAMP levels in neurons
mimicking ongoing neuronal activity, which is critical for survival
of CNS neurons (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995). In line with
these earlier findings, we found that the survival-promoting activity
of UCM is only functional in the presence of forskolin in the
minimal medium (Fig. 5C, one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001). Together
, these results demonstrate that UCM strongly stimulate
RGC survival. At lower concentrations (40g/ml), the survival
effect of UCM is additive to that of BDNF or CNTF (Fig. 5D,E,
each pair Student’s t test, p  0.0001), suggesting that neurotrophic
agents other than these two well-characterized growth
factors may be provided by hUTCs.
Atrophy of neuronal processes is a universal event in many
neurological disorders; therefore, providing factors that can trigger
neurite outgrowth can provide therapeutic effects in these
diseases. Thus, we next tested whether hUTC-secreted factors can
support neurite outgrowth. To do so, we supplemented RGC
growth media with UCM at the time of plating. RGCs were plated
at low density and were cultured for 24 h before they were assayed
for neurite outgrowth (for details, see Materials and Methods).
Our quantitative analysis showed that UCM contains factors that
promote neurite outgrowth and elaboration (Fig. 6A–C). Similar

to UCM, ACM also promoted neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6A–C,
ANCOVA, p 0.0001; Fig. 6C, one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001),
although UCM in general was more efficient in inducing overall
elaboration and branching (Fig. 6D,E, one-way ANOVA, p
0.0001). Sholl analysis showed that UCM robustly increases neuronal
complexity, compared with RGCs cultured alone (Fig. 6B).
TheseresultsshowthatUCMcontainfactorsthatsupportneurite
outgrowth in addition to the synaptogenic and neurotropic effects.
Together, our findings strongly suggest that hUTCs can
bolster neuronal health and provide structural and functional
regeneration via these three mechanisms.
hUTC-secreted synaptogenic factors are>100 kDa and are
blocked by GBP
To identify the synaptogenic factors secreted by hUTCs, we first
fractionated UCM using different molecular weight cutoff size
exclusion columns (Fig. 7A). We found that the synaptogenic
effect of UCM is concentrated within the fraction that is larger
than 100 kDa (Fig. 7B,C, one-way ANOVA,p0.001).
It was previously shown that astrocytes secrete synaptogenic
TSP family proteins, which are large oligomeric extracellular matrix
proteins with sizes ranging from 400 to 450 kDa. All TSPs
(TSP1-TSP5) can induce synaptogenesis (Christopherson et al.,
2005; Eroglu et al., 2009), and TSP1 is known to also induce
neurite outgrowth (Neugebauer et al., 1991; DeFreitas et al.,
1995). Analyses of UCM by antibodies specific to TSPs revealed
that hUTCs secrete TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4 (data not shown). To
test whether TSPs are involved in UCM-induced synapse formation
, we used a pharmacological agent, GBP (32M), which is a
known blocker of TSP-induced synaptogenesis (Eroglu et al.,
2009). GBP binds to the synaptogenic TSP receptor, the calcium
channel subunit2-1, and inhibits the interaction between TSP
and2-1 (Eroglu et al., 2009). In agreement with a role for TSPs
in UCM-induced synapse formation, addition of GBP during
UCM treatment diminished the majority of the synaptogenic activity
of UCM (Fig. 7D,E, one-way ANOVA,p0.0001). These
results suggest that TSP family proteins are the major synaptogenic
factors secreted by hUTCs.
TSPs are necessary for the synaptogenic activity of UCM
To test whether hUTC-secreted TSPs are required for the synaptogenic
effect of UCM, we silenced the expression of TSP1, TSP2,
and TSP4 in hUTCs by lentivirus-mediated shRNA transduction
(Fig. 8A–D). Using isoform-specific shRNAs, TSPs were knocked
down individually or in combination. Only the hUTCs transduced
with shRNA-containing lentivirus were cultured to produce
conditioned medium using puromycin selection (Fig.
8B,C). Specific knockdown of each TSP by the corresponding
shRNA was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 8D). UCM produced
from the lentiviral transduction of same parent plasmid
vector without shRNAs (KD-CTR) or with lentivirus containing
scrambled TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4 shRNAs (SCR-CTR) were used
as controls. UCM were produced from lentivirus-infected
hUTCs and applied to RGCs to identify the effects of TSP knockdown
(Fig. 8A). Quantification of synapse numbers and synapse
density in RGCs revealed that all three TSPs (TSP1, TSP2, and
TSP4) contributed to the synaptogenic function of UCM (Fig.
9A–D). Knockdown of all three TSPs (TSP124-KD) completely
abolished the ability of UCM to induce synapse formation
compared with UCM made from SCR-CTR transduced UTC
(Fig. 9A,B, one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001). To test whether all
three TSPs are required for synaptogenesis, we silenced TSPs individually
or in dual combinations (Fig. 9C). Individual knockdown
of TSPs significantly decreased the number of synapses and
synaptic density compared with KD-CTR UCM (Fig. 9A,C,D,
one-way ANOVA, p 0.0001). These results indicate that TSPs
are required for the synaptogenic activity of UCM.
To determine how TSPs contributed to the effect of UCM on
synaptic activity, we next recorded mEPSCs from RGCs that
were treated with ACM (positive control), SCR-CTR, or
TSP124-KD UCM. We found that silencing of TSP expression
greatly diminished the UCM-induced increase in the frequency
of synaptic events (Fig. 10A–C, Kruskal–Wallis test, p
0.0001;Fig. 10C, one-way ANOVA,p0.0001). This result is in
agreement with our findings that TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4 are required
for the ability of UCM to induce synaptogenesis (Fig. 9).
Together, these findings show that silencing of TSP1, TSP2, and
TSP4 in hUTCs eliminates the ability of these cells to induce an

increaseinsynapsenumbers,whichisdemonstratedbythelossof
colocalized synaptic puncta (Fig. 9) and the reduction in the
frequency of synaptic events (Fig. 10A,B).
Supplementing the TSP124-KD UCM with pure TSP1,
TSP2, and TSP4 (150 ng/ml each) fully restored the synaptogenic
effect of the TSP124-KD UCM (Fig. 11A,B, one-way
ANOVA, p 0.0001). This result confirms that silencing of
TSP expression in hUTCs is the cause of the loss of synaptogenic
effect of these cells. Furthermore, in agreement with
TSPs being the synaptogenic factors in the UCM, adding pure
TSPs into KD-CTR UCM did not further increase the synapse
numbers (Fig. 11C). Together, our results show that TSP1,
TSP2, and TSP4 are the major factors in UCM that drive the
increase in synapse numbers.
hUTC-secreted TSPs promote neurite outgrowth
It was previously shown that TSP1 promotes neurite outgrowth
(Neugebauer et al., 1991;DeFreitas et al., 1995). Thus,
we next tested whether TSPs contribute to the neurite
outgrowth-promoting effect of hUTCs. Silencing TSP expression
abolished neurite outgrowth effects of UCM (Fig. 12A–E,
ANCOVA,p0.0001). Single knockdowns of TSP1, TSP2, or
TSP4 were all enough to completely abolish the neurite
outgrowth-promoting effects of UCM (Fig. 12F, one-way
ANOVA, p 0.0001), including the effects on the number of
processes and the number of branches (Fig. 12G,H). Interestingly
, KD of TSP1 or TSP2, but not TSP4, alone led to a minor
but significant inhibition of neurite outgrowth by UCM compared
RGCs cultured alone (Fig. 12F, marked by #, one-way
ANOVA,p0.0001). This result suggests that UCM contains
factors that inhibit neurite outgrowth and the negative effects
of these factors can be overcome by TSP1 and TSP2.
Supplementing the TSP124-KD UCM with pure TSPs
(150 ng/ml) rescued the neurite outgrowth-promoting function
of the UCM (Fig. 13A–C). Adding back TSP2 or TSP4
alone to the TSP124-KD UCM fully recovered the neurite
outgrowth-stimulating function of the UCM (Fig. 13C, each
pair Student’sttest,p0.0001). However, adding TSP1 back
did not rescue the outgrowth effect of TSP124-KD UCM
(Fig. 13C). These results show that TSP2 and TSP4 are more
active in promoting neurite outgrowth than TSP1 in the full
complement of the UCM. Together, these results show that
TSPs are required for the neurite outgrowth-promoting function
of UCM in vitro.
hUTCs induce neurite outgrowth under growth-inhibiting
conditions
Upon CNS injury, CSPGs are overproduced by reactive glia, and
myelin proteins, such as Nogo-A, are released from degenerating
nerve fibers. These proteins inhibit axon regeneration (Niedero ¨st
et al., 2002;Silver and Miller, 2004;Usher et al., 2010;Walker et
al., 2012), impeding neuronal repair after injury. Therefore, we
next tested whether hUTCs could promote neurite outgrowth
under conditions that inhibit growth. To do so, we modified the
RGC neurite outgrowth assay by coating the coverslips with
CSPG or Nogo-A (Fig. 14A,B). CSPG significantly hindered neurite
outgrowth starting at 0.05 g/cm2 and completely blocked
growth at 0.2 g/cm2 or higher concentrations (Fig. 14A, Student
’s t test, p 0.05) Similarly, Nogo-A blocked neurite outgrowth
in RGCs starting at 1 g/cm2 with 50% of neurite
growth inhibited at 2 g/cm2 (Fig. 14B, Student’s t test, p 
0.05). Interestingly, hUCM transduced with lentiviruses that encode
scrambled shRNAs (SCR-CTR UCM) induced neurite outgrowth
in RGCs that were plated onto coverslips with 0.05 g/
cm2CSPG or 1g/cm2Nogo-A (Fig. 14A,B, Student’sttest,p
0.0001). These results show that hUCM is capable of inducing
neurite outgrowth, even under growth-inhibiting conditions.
However, SCR-CTR UCM was not able to trigger significant neu-

rite outgrowth at high CSPG (0.2 g/cm2) and Nogo-A (2
g/cm2) concentrations (Fig. 14A,B, Student’s t test, not
significant).
Unlike SCR-CTR UCM, TSP124-KD UCM did not
trigger neurite outgrowth when 0.05 g/cm2 CSPG (Fig.
14C,E)or1g/cm2 Nogo-A (Fig. 14D,F) was present, indicating
that TSPs are centrally important for the neurite
outgrowth-promoting effects of hUCM under growthinhibiting
conditions. Addition of purified TSP2 or TSP4
alone or all three TSPs together rescued the ability of
TSP124-KD UCM to induce neurite outgrowth in the
presence of CSPG or Nogo-A (Fig. 14C–F, each pair Student’s
t test, p  0.05). These results show that TSPs, particularly
TSP2 and TSP4, are responsible for the growth-stimulating
effects of hUCM in the presence of CSPG or Nogo-A.
Myelin debris that is generated by CNS injury also sheds
high levels of the myelin protein MBP (Liu et al., 2006;Stapulionis
et al., 2008). To determine whether MBP had neurite
outgrowth-inhibiting effects on CNS neurons, we performed
the RGC outgrowth assay in the presence of 10g/ml soluble
MBP. We chose this MBP concentration because a previous
study showed that MBP induces neurotoxicity at concentrations10g/ml (Zhang et al., 2014). We found that MBP at
10g/ml leads to a mild, but significant, loss of neurite outgrowth
in RGCs (Fig. 14J,14	0.07% reduction in outgrowth
compared with RGCs culture under normal growth media
conditions; Student’s t test, p 0.05). SCR-CTR UCM still
induced significant neurite outgrowth in the presence of MBP,
and this effect of the UCM was lost when TSPs were silenced
(i.e., TSP124-KD UCM; Fig. 14G,I). Interestingly, only
the addition of pure TSP2 back into the TSP124-KD UCM
rescued the outgrowth-promoting effect. This result shows
that, in the presence of MBP, TSP2 can still mediate neurite
outgrowth. Together, these results show that, under growthinhibiting
conditions, hUTC-secreted TSPs, TSP2, and TSP4
mediate neurite outgrowth. In agreement with this, we found
that the addition of pure TSPs to the growth media is sufficient
to induce RGC neurite outgrowth in the presence of CSPG,
Nogo-A, or MBP (Fig. 14H,J).
TSPs do not mediate the survival-promoting effects of hUTCs
To determine the effect of hUTC-secreted TSPs on RGC survival,
we next tested the survival-promoting effect of TSP124-KD
UCM under minimal media conditions. We found that knockdown
of TSP2 or TSP4 or all three TSPs, but not TSP1 alone,
results in a small but significant decrease in the survivalpromoting
activity of the UCM (Fig. 15A,B, each pair Student’st
test, p 0.001). Supplementing the TSP124-KD UCM with
pure TSPs either individually or all together did not rescue the
survival-promoting function of the UCM (Fig. 15A,C, each pair
Student’sttest,p0.001). These results show that TSPs do not
account for the major survival-promoting activity of UCM.
However, they may affect neuronal survival potentially by altering
the expression or function of other neurotrophic factors secreted
by hUTCs.
Discussion
Our results provide novel aspects of hUTC–neuron interactions
and reveal potential therapeutic mechanisms provided
by hUTC therapy. Here we show that paracrine factors secreted
by hUTCs promote excitatory synapse formation, enhance

addition to supporting neuronal survival. Synaptic dysfunction
and loss, degeneration of neuronal processes, and neuron
death are hallmarks of neurological diseases and retinal degenerations.
Therefore, hUTC cell therapy may provide protective
and regenerative signals to neurons that could prevent the
onset and/or progression of neurological disorders.
Numerous studies that investigated the underlying mechanisms
of neurodegenerative diseases revealed that synaptic abnormalities

(Reiner et al., 1988; Davies et al., 2007; Orth et al., 2010;
McKinstry et al., 2014), Alzheimer’s disease (Hynd et al., 2004;
Abramov et al., 2009), Parkinson’s disease (Plowey and Chu,
2011; Luk et al., 2012), and retinal degenerations (Tso et al.,
1994; Jones et al., 2003; Cuenca et al., 2005). The progressive
loss of synaptic function, leading to the deterioration of
the neuroanatomy, is thought to be the main driver of neuron
loss (Raff et al., 2002; Milnerwood and Raymond, 2010; Conforti
et al., 2014; Neukomm and Freeman, 2014). Therefore,
our findings also bring forward the idea that hUTC therapy
could be used to preserve synaptic connectivity, repair neuronal
anatomy, and sustain neuronal health providing a useful
common restorative intervention in neurodegenerative
diseases.
hUTCs induce synapse formation and neurite outgrowth by
secreting TSPs
TSPs are important regulators in the development and injurydependent
remodeling of the mammalian nervous system
(Christopherson et al., 2005; Liauw et al., 2008; Eroglu et al.,
2009; Benner et al., 2013). A previous study reported that
umbilical cord blood-derived cells secrete TSP2 that promotes
chondrogenic differentiation of bone progenitor cells (Jeong
et al., 2013). However, it was not known whether hUTCs, a
distinct cell population from the cord blood cells, also produce
TSPs. Here, we identified TSP family proteins, TSP1, TSP2,
and TSP4, as the critical hUTC-secreted factors that induce
excitatory synapse formation. Silencing of TSP expression in
hUTCs revealed that each of these TSPs is partially responsible
for the synaptogenic effect of the UCM. hUTC-secreted TSP1
and TSP2 appeared to exert a larger portion of the synaptogenic
effect of UCM compared with TSP4. However, only the
triple knockdown of TSPs is able to eliminate the full synaptogenic
effects of hUTCs, revealing that all three subtypes of
TSPs, TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4, significantly contribute to this
function of hUTCs. These results are in line with our previous
findings that showed that all members of the TSP family share
the synapse-inducing function, which is mediated by the EGF-
like domains, a signature fold that is found in all TSPs (Eroglu
et al., 2009).
In addition to their critical role in promoting synapse formation,
we found that hUTC-secreted TSPs are required for the neurite
outgrowth-stimulating function of the UCM. Silencing the expression
of any one of the three TSPs (TSP1, TSP2, or TSP4) in hUTCs
led to the complete loss of the neurite outgrowth-stimulating function
of UCM (Fig. 12). Moreover, we found that hUTC-secreted
TSPs, particularly TSP2 and TSP4, are able to induce significant
neurite outgrowth, even in the presence of growth-inhibiting factors
, such as CSPG, Nogo-A, and MBP (Fig. 14). The synaptogenic
and neurite-outgrowth-promoting effects of TSPs may be performed
through different pathways. Indeed, it has been shown that
different domains on TSPs interact with a milieu of neuronal surface
receptors to mediate many different functions (Risher and Eroglu,
2012).
Together, our results provide an important mechanistic
understanding on how hUTCs may be therapeutic. Catastrophic
loss of neuronal processes (both axons and dendrites)
and their inability to regrow are common occurrences in many

[red]; postsynaptic: Homer [green]) demonstrate that the synaptogenic activity of UCM is lost when TSP124-KD UCM is used. This loss can be rescued by adding purified TSP1, TSP2,

disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases (Raff et al., 
2002; Conforti et al., 2014; Neukomm and Freeman, 2014).
Our results indicate that hUTCs, via secretion of TSPs,
support the health of existing neurites and stimulate the regeneration
of new processes. Concurrently, these new neurites
could provide sites for regenerative synapse formation triggered
by hUTC-secreted TSPs, leading to reestablishment of
synaptic connectivity.

hUTCs enhance synaptic function
Previous studies on the role of astrocytes in synapse formation
showed that TSP1 and TSP2 are the necessary and sufficient factors
in ACM that stimulate a strong increase in synapse number
(Christopherson et al., 2005). However, these studies also revealed
that the TSP-induced synapses are postsynaptically inactive
due to the lack of AMPA-type glutamate receptors on the
postsynaptic side (Christopherson et al., 2005). Astrocytes secrete
other signals, including the Glypican (Gpc) family proteins
Gpc-4 and Gpc-6, which trigger insertion of AMPA receptors to
synapses promoting formation of postsynaptically functional
synapses (Allen et al., 2012). Here we found that the synapses
formed, either by coculture with hUTCs or by UCM treatment,
are postsynaptically active, similar to the astrocyte-induced synapses.
These results indicate that, in addition to TSPs, which
increase the synapse number, hUTCs secrete factors that stimulate
functional maturation of the postsynaptic activity. This result
indicates that hUTCs secrete factors other than TSPs that enhance
postsynaptic activity, potentially through a similar mechanism
to astrocytes.
hUTCs support neuronal survival through factors other
than TSPs
Using the purified RGC culture system, we took advantage of the
well-defined serum-free media conditions to explore the potential
neurotrophic effects of the hUTC secretome. Our results showed
that hUTCs secrete factors that strongly promote neuronal survival.
We found that the survival-promoting function of hUTCs is not
shared by astrocytes. In agreement with this, the majority of the
survival-promoting effect of hUTCs is not dependent on TSPs.
Our results demonstrate that silencing TSP2 or TSP4, but
not TSP1, have minor but significant negative effects on the
overall survival activity of UCM. Interestingly, supplementing
the TSP124-KD UCM with pure TSPs did not recover the
full survival effect of UCM. This result indicates that the reduction
we see in the neurotrophic function of TSP-KD UCM
is not due to a direct effect of TSP loss. It is possible that TSPs
are involved in the secretion of the survival factors from
hUTCs. In agreement with this, TSP4 is a known component
of endoplasmic reticulum stress response in heart muscle that
is used for the trafficking and secretion of proteins (Lynch et
al., 2012).
BDNF, CNTF, and IGF-1, are known to provide neurotrophic
effects on RGCs via distinct pathways. However, the activity of
the neurotrophic pathways depends on the presence of forskolin
in the culture media, which ensures increased c-AMP levels in
RGCs (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995). Our results show that, similar
to these known trophic pathways, UCM’s strong effect on RGC
survival also requires forskolin. Therefore, it is plausible that
hUTCs secrete these factors. Indeed, several studies revealed that
hUTCs make BDNF (Lund et al., 2007;Alder et al., 2012). However
, testing the combinatorial effects of BDNF (or CNTF) with
UCM revealed that UCM could provide additional neurotrophic
effects when used together with these growth factors. This result
suggests that UCM might contain additional factors that support
neuronal survival.
In conclusion, using a purified neuronal culture system, here
we demonstrated that hUTCs secrete factors that affect multiple
aspects of neuronal function and structure. Moreover, we
showed that TSP family members TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4 mediate

the synaptogenic and neurite outgrowth-promoting functions of
hUTCs. Notably, hUTCs can promote neurite outgrowth of
RGCs, even in the presence of neurite growth inhibitors, CSPG,
Nogo-A, or MBP, via TSP2 and TSP4. Together, these results
highlight the unique neuroprotective properties of hUTCs and
pinpoint the TSPs that they secrete as the molecules that potentially
drive the therapeutic effects of these cells.
