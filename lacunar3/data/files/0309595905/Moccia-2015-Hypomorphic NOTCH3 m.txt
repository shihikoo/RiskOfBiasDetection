The cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy
(CADASIL) is because of NOTCH3 mutations affecting the number of cysteine residues. In this view, the
role of atypical NOTCH3mutations is still debated. Therefore, we investigated a family carrying a NOTCH3
nonsense mutation, with dominantly inherited recurrent cerebrovascular disorders. Among 7 family
members, 4 received a clinical diagnosis of CADASIL. A heterozygous truncating mutation in exon 3
(c.307C>T, p.Arg103X) was found in the 4 clinically affected subjects and in one 27-year old lady, only
complaining of migraine with aura. Magnetic resonance imaging scans found typical signs of small-vessel
disease in the 4 affected subjects, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Skin biopsies did not show the typical
granular osmiophilic material, but only nonspecific signs of vascular damage, resembling those previously
described in Notch3 knockout mice. Interestingly, messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis supports the
hypothesis of an atypicalNOTCH3mutation, suggesting a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In conclusion,
the present study broadens the spectrum of CADASIL mutations, and, therefore, opens new insights
about Notch3 signaling.

1. Introduction
The cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common
hereditary small-vessel disease. Its diagnosis may require a multidisciplinary
approach to its clinical, radiological, pathologic, and
genetic features.
Although the age at onset and the clinical picture vary substantially
between and within families, CADASIL is characterized
by 5 main clinical features: migraine with aura, subcortical
ischemic events, mood disturbances, apathy, and cognitive
impairment. Migraine with aura may represent the first clinical
symptom in up to 20%e40% of patients, with an average age at
onset of 30 years. In addition, patients usually have recurrent
strokes from the age of 40 years, progressively leading to motor
and cognitive impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
abnormalities precede the onset of clinical symptoms, involving
virtually all the affected subjects by the age of 35 years and
increasing as the disease progresses (Chabriat et al., 2009).
CADASIL brain pathology reveals severe leukoencephalopathy,
vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) degeneration, and granular
osmiophilic material (GOM) deposits in the tunica media, close to
the basal membrane of the VSMC. GOM deposits are also found in
extracerebral vessels, for instance, in dermal arterioles; thus, skin
biopsy has been suggested as a screening procedure in subjects

with suspected CADASIL. This diagnostic procedure has a relatively
high specificity but presents the risk of false negative patients
because of difficulties in observing a sufficient number of vessels
with muscular walls in skin biopsies (Malandrini et al., 2007).
From a genetic perspective, CADASIL is an autosomal dominant
disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3. This gene encodes a
single-pass transmembrane receptor that functions at the cell
surface as a heterodimer. Its extracellular domain (ECD) needs to
be stabilized by the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine
residues within the 34 epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats.
NOTCH3has 33 exons, but all CADASIL mutations apparently occur
in exons 2e24 that encode the ECD, with strong clustering in
exons 3 and 4 (EGF repeats 2e5), resulting in an uneven number of
cysteine residues in one of the EGF repeats. This change in the
number of cysteines seems to be the common denominator in
CADASIL mutations and may underlie neomorphic properties with
the gain of a toxic function (Chabriat et al., 2009). In particular,
GOM formation could be enhanced by the gradual accumulation of
the mutated NOTCH3 (Joutel, 2010). However, it is still debated if
GOM deposits are part of CADASIL pathogenesis or only represent
an epiphenomenon in this disease. In particular, little is known
about NOTCH3 additional functions in adults, and animal models
suggest that CADASIL subcortical ischemia may be related to an
impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation with consequent
white matter hypoperfusion (Joutel, 2010; Joutel et al., 2010).
Interestingly, those mutations altering the number of cysteine
residues in the ECD of NOTCH3can be unambiguously classified as
pathogenic, whereas all the other NOTCH3 mutations (i.e., hypomorphic
mutations) may well be responsible for symptoms that
do not present the fullyfledged phenotype of CADASIL but instead
a syndrome along the spectrum of CADASIL-like disorders
(Schmidt et al., 2011).
In particular, Rutten et al. (2013) and we recently described a
NOTCH3 nonsense mutation (exon 3, c.307C>T, p.Arg103X) in 2
different families (Erro et al., 2014). This is the first described
NOTCH3nonsense mutation. The variant is located in the EGF-like 2
region of exon 3 and could possibly produce a truncated protein
lacking of EGF-like, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic domains
or not even be translated because of nonsense-mediated decay.
Rutten et al. (2013)reported 2 brothers carrying this mutation and,
considering the lack of significant CADASIL features inw50 year
olds, suggested this NOTCH3 nonsense mutation to be a neutral
variant (Rutten et al., 2013). Conversely, we previously described a
carrier of the same mutation with a clinical picture of vascular
parkinsonism and cognitive impairment, an onset after 70 years,
and an autosomal dominant stroke family history (Fig. 1, subject 4)
(Erro et al., 2014). Considering that there are no previous investigations
about the effects of NOTCH3 nonsense mutations and
additional efforts are clearly required to explore the relevance of
such mutation, we extended our investigations to the entire family
and followed it up, to hereby report effects of this mutation on
clinical features, neuroradiological imaging, pathologic findings at
skin biopsy, and messenger RNA (mRNA) activity. In particular, the
present study has the main aim to investigate if this nonsense
NOTCH3 mutation is causing CADASIL, CADASIL-like symptoms, or
an unknown disease falling into a spectrum of CADASIL-like
syndromes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects and clinical and radiological assessments
The local ethical committee approved this study, and all subjects
gave a written informed consent. A nonconsanguineous family from
Naples (Italy) was clinically examined because of recurrent cases of
cerebrovascular disease. The family consisted of 4 generations with
a pattern of possible autosomal dominant inheritance (Fig. 1).
All subjects were evaluated by means of the CADASIL scale, a
screening tool to select subjects with high suspicion of CADASIL
before genetic testing (Pescini et al., 2012). Asymptomatic subjects
underwent a multidisciplinary and multistep procedure for presymptomatic
diagnostic test to reduce, as much as possible,
potentially harmful consequences of genetic testing (Reyes et al.,
2012).
Additional risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were evaluated
by means of clinical records (smoking), physical examination
(blood pressure and body weight), and blood tests (cholesterol and
glycemia). Brain MRI studies were performed at 1.5 T. Imaging sequences
included a 3-dimensional T1-weighted gradient-echo
volume with isotropic voxels and axial diffusion-weighted, axial
and coronal T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, and FLAIR images.
2.2. Skin biopsy
Skin biopsies were performed in at least 2 different body sites by
means of 3-mm skin punches after a small injection of a local
anesthetic (mepivacaine 3%). Skin biopsy samples were fixed in
2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M cacodylate buffer, rinsed in cacodylate
buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.1 M cacodylate buffer,
and rinsed again in buffer. Tissue samples were gradually dehydrated
in a series of ascending concentrations of ethanol and, then,
were immersed in propylene oxide before infiltration with the
epoxy resin Epon 812. Ultrathin sections double stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate were examined with Transmission Electron
Microscope (Zeiss 900).
2.3. Genetic studies
DNA samples from all members were isolated from whole blood
using standard procedures (Miller et al., 1988). Subjects involved in
the present study gave informed consent for DNA storage and
authorized the use of this material for current and possible future
diagnostic and research procedures, on request. Considering the
mutation (c.307C>T, p.Arg103X) identified in the proband (subject
4) (Erro et al., 2014), the recruited family members were analyzed
only for thisNOTCH3mutation. The nucleotide position of mutation
refers to the mRNA sequence (NM_000435). Mutation Taster
(http://www.mutationtaster.org/) was used to predict the

functional effect of this nonsense variant. We previously showed
that this variant was not a polymorphism through the analysis of
200 chromosomes from healthy controls, together with the
consultation of different online human gene mutation databases
(Erro et al., 2014).
2.4. mRNA study
Skin biopsies selected for mRNA studies were immediately
frozen at 80 C. RNA was isolated from skin specimens by using
TRIzol reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life
Technologies). Reverse transcription was performed in a total reaction
volume of 20mL by means of iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-
Rad) and 0.5 mg of RNA samples.
We applied a strategy to check whether the nucleotide variation
could influence exon 3 splicing that would have led to an odd
number of cysteine residues and, therefore, a typical CADASIL
mutation. Thus, primers were designed to cover part of exons 2 and
4 and completely exon 3. Complementary DNA was then polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplified with forward (50
GGAGGTCGTTGCACCCAG 30) and reverse (50 AGGTCGCCACTCTGCCTG
30) primers under the following conditions: 96C for
10 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 95 C for 30 seconds, 57 C for
60 seconds, 72 C for 60 seconds, and a final cycle of 72 C for 5
minutes.
Three-microliter PCR products were then directly loaded onto a
2% agarose gel and separated at 90 V forw25 minutes. Moreover,
the same PCR products were directly sequenced on an automated
sequencing system (Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer) using
the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 1.1 (Applied
Biosystems).
3. Results
3.1. Clinical studies
Seven members of the family were included in the present study
(subject 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13) (Fig. 1andTable 1). In particular, in
thefirst generation, subject 1 died at the age of 56 years because of
a stroke; no further information or clinical records were reported to
us. In the second generation, among 5 siblings, subject 3 died
because of laryngeal cancer (57-year-old male); subject 4 had a
parkinsonian syndrome with apathy and mood disorders (76-yearold
male, CADASIL scale 17/25) (Erro et al., 2014) and married an
apparently healthy woman (71-year-old female [subject 5]); subject
6 died from colon cancer (61-year-old male); subject 7 had recurrent
strokes in her 40s, presented a severe cognitive impairment,
and was wheelchair dependent because of hemiparesis (67-yearold
female, CADASIL scale 18/25); and subject 8 was apparently
healthy (64-year-old male, CADASIL scale 2/25). We did not include
subjects 3 and 6 in the present report, considering that extensive
information was not available because of their death. In the third
generation, we investigated siblings from subject 4; in particular,
subject 9 had a history of recurrent strokes (42-year-old male,
CADASIL scale 15/25) and married an apparently healthy woman,
and subject 11 had a stroke at 38 years and had suffered from
migraine with aura since juvenile age (39-year-old female, CADASIL
scale 18/25). In the fourth generation, subject 12 suffered from
migraine with aura since juvenile age (27-year-old female, CADASIL
scale 6/25), subject 13 was apparently healthy (23-year-old female,
CADASIL scale 3/25), and subject 14 was excluded from the present
study because of ethical concerns for subjects<18 years (16-yearold
male).
Among additional cardiovascular risk factors, subject 7 suffered
from increased blood cholesterol levels and was treated with
atorvastatin 20 mg per day; subjects 4 and 9 were undergoing
therapy for increased blood pressure with doxazosin 2 mg per day
and ramipril 2.5 mg per day, respectively; and subject 11 used to
smoke almost 10 cigarettes per day.
MRI scans showed significant vascular signs in subjects 4 (Erro
et al., 2014), 7, 9, and 11 (details are shown in Fig. 2), whereas no
abnormalities were found in subjects 8,12, and 13. Clinical features,
radiologicalfindings, and CADASIL scale scores are shown inTable 1.
3.2. Pathologic studies
All recruited subjects underwent skin biopsy in at least 2
different body sites (right and left upper limbs). At least 20 vessels
were observed in each skin biopsy. In subjects 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12,
ultrastructural analysis of dermal small arteries showed endothelial
and smooth muscle cells with electrolucent vacuoles and nuclear
chromatin condensation. Furthermore, smooth muscle cells presented
irregular shape; within them, cytoplasmic organelles were
reduced in number and degenerating, with irregularities in size and
shape (Fig. 3). Notably, such abnormalities were only observed in
perivascular cells and not in other regions of examined samples,
arguing against the possibility of fixation orientation artefacts. Ultrastructural
investigations did not record any GOM in any subjects.

Subjects 8 and 13 did not display any of the previously described
findings.
3.3. Genetic studies
DNA analysis revealed the heterozygous NOTCH3 mutation
c.307C>T in subjects 4, 7, 9, 11, and 12. The variant is located in the
EGF-like 2 region of exon 3 and causes the substitution of arginine
with a stop codon at position 103 of the protein (p.Arg103X).
Therefore, the formation of such premature stop codon would
result in the production of a truncated protein lacking the amino
acids encoded by exon 3 and subsequent exons (4/33) and, therefore
, characterized by the absence of all EGF-like repeat domains
except EGF-like 1. Prediction programs hypothesize a diseasecausing
activity and suggest a potential nonsense-mediated decay
mechanism.
3.4. RNA studies
Skin biopsies for mRNA studies were performed in 2 mutation
carriers (subjects 4 and 7) and in 1 nonmutated healthy subject
(subject 8). All experiment results would argue against the presence
of a mutated mRNA allele that could be translated into a
truncated protein and strongly suggests a nonsense-mediated
decay, leaving only the wild-type allele to be amplified and
sequenced. No exon 3 mutations were detected by direct
sequencing of the amplified fragment. Although no qualitative
differences were found between cases and control at mRNA level,

mutated subjects showed a weaker band corresponding to the
amplified fragment, whereas a band more evident was present in
the sample collected from the nonmutated healthy subject (data
not presented because of the bad quality of images). Experiment
results were compatible with the presence of exon 3 indicating that
the identified nucleotide variant does not affect the splicing
mechanism, thus excluding a typical CADASIL mutation.
4. Discussion
CADASIL is caused by NOTCH3 dominant mutations leading to
an uneven number of cysteine residues in one of the 34 EGF receptor
domains constituting the ECD of the receptor. All other
mutations should be called unclassified variants at the first
observation, but significant efforts have been done to clarify
whether such hypomorphic NOTCH3 mutations are neutral polymorphisms
or causative for a distinct cerebrovascular entity
(Joutel, 2013). In particular, NOTCH3 nonsense mutations have
never been reported, although a frameshift deletion leading to a
premature stop codon has been previously associated to CADASIL
phenotype (Dotti et al., 2004). In this view, we explored, for the
first time, clinical, radiological, pathologic, genetic, and molecular
findings in a family carrying aNOTCH3nonsense mutation in exon
3 (c.307C>T, p.Arg103X).
First of all, it is important to remember that CADASIL is defined
by several specific symptoms and traits, must affect the brain, and
be dominantly inherited (Schmidt et al., 2011). In the present
family, the clinical picture was highly suggestive of CADASIL, with
autosomal dominant inheritance and a typical timeline, clearly
shown by the progressive increase of CADASIL scale scores
through generations (Table 1)( Chabriat et al., 2009; Pescini et al.,
2012). In particular, migraine with aura was reported by subjects 9
and 11 and was the only manifestation in the youngest mutation
carrier (subject 9). Moreover, a history of recurrent strokes was
present in all mutation carriers after the age of 40 years. Finally,
progressive cognitive and motor impairments were recorded in
elderly members (parkinsonism with mood disturbances and
apathy in subject 4 and dementia and hemiparesis in subject 7)
(Erro et al., 2014). Notably, no significant cerebrovascular risk
factors were reported.
In addition to this, MRI scans of the 4 definitely affected subjects
showed cerebrovascular signs in the external capsule, in the anterior
part of temporal lobes, in periventricular areas, and in the
centrum semiovale, whereas U fibres and cortex were relatively
spared, as typically described in CADASIL (Auer et al., 2001; Cirillo
et al., 2012; O’Sullivan et al., 2001; Yousry et al., 1999). Although
in advanced phases such signs become more diffused, white matter
hyperintensities have been described in CADASIL patients since the
age of 21 years (Chabriat et al., 2009; Chawda et al., 2000). However,
subject 12 (27-year-old female) presented no significant abnormalities
on MRI. This is possibly because of CADASIL phenotype
variability or, at least, of gender differences with females less prone
to larger subcortical infarcts (Gunda et al., 2012).
At skin biopsy, in contrast with the typical neuropathology
related to NOTCH3 mutations affecting cysteine residues in the
ECD, we failed to show any GOM deposits. The risk of false negative
has been strongly minimized by the number of subjects
receiving 2 different skin biopsies and by the observation of at
least 20 vessels per biopsy. Therefore, we may hypothesize that if
GOM formation is enhanced by NOTCH3 with uneven cysteine
residues, the p.Arg103X nonsense mutation is not associated with
GOM because of the absence of unstable Notch3. Indeed, noncanonical NOTCH3 mutations have already been described in subjects
with hereditary small-vessel disease of the brain without
GOM deposits and Notch3 accumulation (Fouillade et al., 2008),
suggesting that the absence of GOM deposits in our patients could
be related to the specific truncating mutation carried by this
family. However, we could identify nonspecific VSMC alterations
in all mutation carriers. Interestingly, the structural and functional
integrities of small arteries are impaired in knockout mice for
Notch3 (Notch3/), with increased susceptibility to ischemic
brain injury. These mice are known to present marked defects in
distal muscular arteries, particularly in the cerebral ones,
including enlarged arteries with a thinner muscular coat and
abnormal shape and smaller size of smooth muscle cells, in the
absence of GOM accumulation (Joutel, 2010). This pattern might in
fact resemble the neuropathologic findings in the present family;
thus, a pathogenic mechanism not involving GOM accumulation
should be hypothesized, at least for hypomorphic NOTCH3 mutations
, and could possibly explain the increased clinical heterogeneity
of CADASIL-like syndromes (Malandrini et al., 2007; Wallays
et al., 2011).
At genetic studies, CADASIL mutations typically result in an odd
number of cysteine residues, with 1 residue subsequently unpaired.
Even if CADASIL mutations have traditionally been considered to
result in a gain of function, the molecular mechanisms leading to
the development of NOTCH3-related diseases remain elusive
(Joutel, 2010; Joutel et al., 2010). In addition,Notch3has a noticeable
ability to recruit coactivators and/or corepressors and to undergo
different conformational changes, and it is also unclear whether the
possible relationships between Notch3 and other molecules/pathways
are responsible for the pathogenesis of NOTCH-related diseases
(Bellavia et al., 2008; Opherk et al., 2006; Penton et al., 2012).
In our case, considering our preliminary mRNA analysis and prediction
program results, the stop codon introduced at amino acid
position 103 causes the substitution of arginine with a stop codon,
possibly leading to a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Therefore, a
loss-of-function mechanism cannot be excluded, in particular for
CADASIL-like syndromes with noncanonical NOTCH3 mutations.
We must acknowledge some limitations and, in particular, are
aware that some loss-of-function alleles are tolerated and not disease
causing, and the lack of quantitative studies on mRNA and of
functional studies on Notch3 protein activity limits our conclusions.
Considering that subjects did not consent to muscle biopsy, we
performed our analyses on skin biopsy samples that only provided a
limited quantity of material for processing. In addition, prediction
software is usually less accurate in the presence of a truncated
protein (Schwarz and Seelow, 2013). However, we performed a
preliminary mRNA analysis that suggests a possible nonsensemediated
mRNA decay.
In a recent review, Rutten et al. (2013) stated that variants in
NOTCH3 leading to loss of NOTCH3 function (i.e., frameshift and
stop mutations) do not cause CADASIL until proven otherwise
(Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011; Rutten et al., 2014), in line with
the family they previously described. However, Rutten et al.
(2013) described 2 clinically unaffected siblings in their 50s
carrying the NOTCH3 mutation, but these individuals could still
develop the disease particularly because this same mutation is
associated in the proband of the present study with an age at
onset of atypical symptoms of 72 years. By contrast, in our
family, there is a strict cosegregation of the mutation with
CADASIL features, well explained by clinical and MRI findings,
thus indicating that this is a causative mutation. To account both
families, we may hypothesize that nontypical NOTCH3 mutations
may originate a CADASIL-like syndrome without the full spectrum
of signs of CADASIL and with different clinical phenotypes
presenting variable penetrance and/or age at onset. It is worthwhile
to report that there is a significant variability in the clinical
picture of CADASIL also for typical mutations, as recently shown
in a subject with clinical Alzheimer disease, carrying a typical

NOTCH3 mutation (Guerreiro et al., 2012). Clinical variability for
different mutations in the same gene is well known for several
neurological disorders, and, for instance, it has already been
studied for point mutations in PRNP gene that are typically
associated with prion diseases but have been reported also in
cases of Alzheimer’s disease, systemic amyloidosis, and autonomic
dysfunctions, not fitting the typical prion disease phenotype
(Guerreiro et al., 2014; Jansen et al., 2010; Jayadev et al.,
2011; Mead et al., 2013).
5. Conclusions
We described clinical, radiological, and pathological features of
an extended family carrying a nonsense NOTCH3 mutation.
Considering ourfindings, the p.Arg103X nonsense mutation seems
to be responsible of a CADASIL-like syndrome and may play a
greater role in ischemic stroke than previously thought (Erro et al.,
2014; Joutel, 2013; Moccia et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2013; Testi et al.,
2012). In addition, hypomorphic mutations in NOTCH3 may
possibly be responsible for nontypical CADASIL pathology, and
further investigations should be specifically addressed. The present
study broadens the spectrum of CADASIL mutations and, therefore,
potentially enhances our understanding of theNotch3signaling and
of the underlying disease mechanism.
