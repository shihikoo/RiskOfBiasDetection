Stroke therapy may be optimized by combination therapy with both a neuroprotective
neurotrophin and an anti-inflammatory agent. In the present work, the model neurotrophin
is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and the model anti-inflammatory
agent is the type II tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) decoy receptor. Both the GDNF
and the TNFR are large molecules that do not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which is
intact in the early hours after stroke when neural rescue is still possible. The GDNF and the
TNFR decoy receptor were re-engineered for BBB transport as IgG fusion proteins, wherein
the GDNF or the TNFR are fused to the heavy chain of a chimeric monoclonal antibody
(MAb) against the mouse transferrin receptor (TfR), and these fusion proteins are
designated cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR, respectively. Mice were treated intravenously
with (a) saline, (b) GDNF alone, (c) the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein alone, or
(d) the combined cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion proteins, following a 1-h
reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein
alone caused a significant 25% and 30% reduction in hemispheric and cortical stroke
volumes. Combined treatment with the cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion
proteins caused a significant 54%, 69% and 30% reduction in hemispheric, cortical and
subcortical stroke volumes. Conversely, intravenous GDNF had no therapeutic effect. In
conclusion, combination treatment with BBB penetrating IgG–GDNF and IgG–TNFR fusion
proteins enhances the therapeutic effect of single treatment with the IgG–GDNF fusion
protein following delayed intravenous administration in acute stroke.

1. Introduction
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a member
of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily, is a
potent neurotherapeutic for acute ischemic stroke (Duarte
et al., 2012). Transient focal ischemia and reperfusion
increased the expression of GDNF and its receptors, GDNF
family receptor (GFR)-a1 and transmembrane tyrosine kinase
(c-Ret), in the penumbral areas in rats (Abe and Hayashi,
1997; Arvidsson et al., 2001). Topical application of GDNF on

the cortical surface reduced stroke volume, brain edema
formation and cell death in focal brain ischemia (Abe et al.,
1997; Kitagawa et al., 1998a,1998b; Jin et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,
2001; Shang et al., 2010). Intra-cerebroventricular and intraparenchymal
injection of GDNF significantly reduced cortical
infarct volume in reversible MCAO in rats (Wang et al., 1997).
Intra-striatal infusion of GDNF in rats promoted striatal
neurogenesis after stroke (Kobayashi et al., 2006). In these
studies, the neurotrophic factor was administrated transcranially
because GDNF is a large molecule drug that does not
cross the intact blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Kastin et al., 2003;
Boado and Pardridge, 2009). The BBB is the primary obstacle
to the use of GDNF as a therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
GDNF can be made transportable across the BBB by
re-engineering the neurotrophin as a fusion protein with a
molecular Trojan horse (MTH) (Boado et al., 2008). A BBB
molecular Trojan horse is an endogenous peptide, or peptidomimetic
monoclonal antibody (MAb), that undergoes
receptor mediated transport across the BBB via endogenous
peptide receptors, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR) or the
insulin receptor (Pardridge, 2012). The most potent BBB
molecular Trojan horse for mouse models is a chimeric
MAb against the mouse TfR, designated the cTfRMAb
(Boado et al., 2009). A fusion protein of human GDNF and
cTfRMAb, designated as cTfRMAb–GDNF, has been engineered
and is a bi-functional protein that (a) retains high
affinity binding for the GDNF receptor, GFRa-1, to mediate the
pharmacological action of GDNF in the brain, and (b) retains
high affinity binding to the mouse TfR, to mediate rapid
transport across the BBB (Zhou et al., 2010).
The first aim of the present study was to examine the
therapeutic effects of intravenous cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion
protein in a reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion
(rMCAO) model of focal cerebral ischemia in the mouse.
A second aim of this study was to examine combination
therapy in stroke whereby the BBB penetrating IgG–GDNF
fusion protein is administered intravenously in combination
with a BBB penetrating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitor
(TNFI). A biologic TNFI is the TNF decoy receptor (TNFR),
and a BBB-penetrating form of the TNFR was engineered by
fusion of the TNFR decoy receptor to the cTfRMAb, which
resulted in the formation of the cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion
protein (Zhou et al., 2011a). The cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion
protein retains high affinity binding to TNFa (Zhou et al.,
2011a), and causes a reduction in stroke volume in the rMCAO
mouse model following intravenous administration (Sumbria
et al., 2012). Therefore, the present studies also examine the
effect of combined treatment with the cTfRMAb–GDNF and
cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion proteins in the mouse rMCAO model.
Mice were treated intravenously with the cTfRMAb–GDNF
fusion protein, the cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR
fusion proteins combined or the non-brain-penetrating
recombinant human GDNF.
2. Results
Coronal brain sections from a representative mouse euthanized
1 day after the 1 h MCAO, and stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC), are shown in Fig. 1. Mean 7SEM
values of the hemispheric, cortical and subcortical infarct
volumes for each of the treatment groups for mice euthanized
1 day post occlusion are shown in Fig. 2. The hemispheric,
cortical and subcortical infarct volume in saline treated mice
was 70.974.5 mm3, 43.6 73.9 mm3 and 27.973.2 mm3, respectively
(Fig. 2). Single treatment with an intravenous injection of
1mg/kg of the cTfRMAb-GDNF fusion protein 45min post 
arterial occlusion resulted in a statistically significant 25% and
30% reduction in hemispheric and cortical stroke volumes, but
had no significant effect on the subcortical stroke volume
(Fig. 2). Conversely, mice treated with an equi-molar dose of
recombinant GDNF, 170mg/kg, at 45 min post arterial occlusion
showed no significant changes in stroke volumes. Mean7SEM
values of the hemispheric, cortical and subcortical infarct
volumes for the saline and cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein
treated mice euthanized 7 days post occlusion are shown in
Fig. 3. Intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of the cTfRMAb–GDNF
fusion protein 45 min post arterial occlusion caused a statistically
significant 39%, 48% and 27% reduction in hemispheric,
cortical and subcortical stroke volume at 7 days post occlusion,
compared to saline treated animals (Fig. 2). The mortality
among animals subjected to 60 min occlusion and 7 days
reperfusion was 10% in the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein
treated group, which was significantly lower than the mortality
among the saline treated animals (42%).
Combination treatment with an intravenous injection of
1 mg/kg each of the cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR
fusion proteins 45 min post arterial occlusion resulted in a
statistically significant 54%, 69% and 30% reduction in hemispheric
, cortical and subcortical stroke volumes, compared to
saline treated animals (Fig. 2). Combination treatment with
the cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion proteins significantly
enhanced the reduction in infarct volumes as
compared to that produced by single treatment with the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein alone (Fig. 2). The reduction in
stroke volume in the hemisphere, the cortex, and the subcortex
was 38%, 56% and 14%, respectively, with combination
therapy (Fig. 2).
3. Discussion
The findings of the present study demonstrate that a
single intravenous injection of brain penetrating GDNF, the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein, reduces total and cortical
infarct volume in experimental stroke (Fig. 2). Combined
intravenous treatment with the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein
and brain penetrating TNFI, the cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion
protein, enhances the effect of single treatment with the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein (Fig. 2). The therapeutic effects
of the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein are long lasting with a
significant reduction in hemispheric, cortical and subcortical
stroke volume at 7 days following acute ischemic stroke
(Fig. 3). Conversely, recombinant human GDNF i.e., nonbrain
penetrating GDNF, has no therapeutic effect in experimental
stroke (Fig. 2).
GDNF is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded homodimeric
large molecule therapeutic with a molecular weight of
33–45 kDa (Lin et al., 1994). Like other neurotrophins, GDNF
does not cross the intact BBB (Kastin et al., 2003; Boado and
brain  research  1507  (2013)  91– 96 92
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
Pardridge, 2009), and intravenous GDNF is not expected to be
neuroprotective in stroke in the presence of an intact BBB.
Opening of the BBB following acute ischemic stroke has been
reported both in rodents (Belayev et al., 1996; Nagaraja et al.,
2008; Durukan et al., 2009) and primates (Latour et al., 2004;
Del Zoppo et al., 1991). However, the time frame of BBB
opening varies with the experimental model (Yang and
Betz, 1994). In rodents, the BBB is intact in the early hours
after stroke (Menzies et al., 1993; Belayev et al., 1996) when
the ischemic penumbra has potential for full recovery (Zivin,
1998; Del Zoppo et al., 2011). In humans, the BBB disruption
that follows stroke is delayed relative to the ischemic tissue
rescue window after stroke (Latour et al., 2004; Del Zoppo
et al., 2011). The finding of the present study that intravenous
injection of recombinant human GDNF is not therapeutic in
experimental stroke is attributed to the intactness of the BBB,
at least for a recombinant protein the size of GDNF, in the
early hours after stroke when reduction in stroke volume is
still possible.
Owing to the lack of GDNF penetration of the BBB, the
neuroprotective effects of exogenous GDNF in various experimental
models of acute ischemic stroke have been tested
previously by intracerebroventricular or intracerebral administration
(Wang et al., 1997, 2002; Kobayashi et al., 2006) or by
topical application on the cortical surface (Abe et al., 1997;
Kitagawa et al., 1998a,1998b; Jin et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2001;
Shang et al., 2010). For GDNF to be therapeutic after intravenous
administration, the neurotrophin must be re-engineered for BBB
penetration, and this is possible by genetic fusion of GDNF to a
BBB molecular Trojan horse. The latter is a peptidomimetic MAb
against an endogenous BBB receptor, such as the human insulin
receptor (HIR) or TfR. A fusion protein of the genetically
engineered HIRMAb and human GDNF has been engineered
and is designated the HIRMAb–GDNF fusion protein ( Boado
et al., 2008). The HIRMAb–GDNF fusion protein binds with high
affinity to both the BBB insulin receptor and the human GFRa-1
receptor (Boado et al., 2008). Since the HIRMAb does not crossreact
with the insulin receptor of rodents and there is no known
MAb against the rodent insulin receptor, a surrogate MTH is
used in mouse studies. This is a genetically engineered chimeric
MAb against the mouse TfR, designated as the cTfRMAb (Boado
et al., 2009). A fusion protein of the cTfRMAb and human GDNF
has also been engineered for mouse studies and is designated
cTfRMAb–GDNF. The human GDNF monomer is fused to the
Fig. 1 – TTC stained coronal sections from a representative mouse treated with a single intravenous injection of saline (A),
170lg/kg rGDNF (B), 1 mg/kg cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein (C), or combinatorial treatment with 1 mg/kg each of the
cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion proteins (D). Treatments were administered 45 min post occlusion, and mice
were euthanized 1 day after 60 min occlusion. Data are mean7SEM (n=9–11 mice per group). The most rostral brain section is
at the top.

carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain of the cTfRMAb placing
the neurotrophin in a dimeric configuration, mimicking its
conformation at the receptor (Zhou et al., 2010). The GDNF
domain of the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein is comprised of
human GDNF, since there is a 93% amino acid homology
between human GDNF (NP_000505) and murine GDNF
(AAB52953), as well as the human GFRa1 (P56159) and murine
GFRa1 (NP_034409). An immune reaction against the human
GDNF domain of the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein in the
mouse is not expected in the present study, wherein only a
single IV injection of the fusion protein was administered.
Moreover, a prior study on chronic dosing of mice with the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein shows there is only a low titer
immune response that has no neutralizing effect (Zhou et al.,
2011b). Chronic treatment of mice with the cTfRMAb–GDNF
fusion protein has no toxic effects on organ histology or serum
chemistry (Zhou et al., 2011b).
Chronic treatment with the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein
is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease
(Fu et al., 2010). The present study demonstrates that an
acute intravenous administration of the cTfRMAb–GDNF
fusion protein is neuroprotective in a mouse model of stroke
(Figs. 1–3). Neural rescue by GDNF in acute ischemic stroke
has been attributed to attenuation of N-methyl D-aspartic
acid (NMDA) responses, suppression of nitric oxide release
after ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, neurogenesis,
and anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic mechanisms (Duarte
et al., 2012). The multiple mechanisms of action may explain
the reduction in subcortical stroke volume at 7 days (Fig. 3),
but not at 1 day (Fig. 2) following single treatment with the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein. GDNF promotes neurogenesis
as well as neuroprotection, and the effect on neurogenesis is
not maximal until 4–7 days after stroke (Kobayashi et al.,
2006).
Acute stroke is a state of neuroinflammation, mediated in
part by TNFa (Liu et al., 1994; Sairanen et al., 2001). At
pathological levels, TNF-a initiates an inflammatory response,
followed by necrotic and apoptotic cell death (Watters and
O’Connor, 2011). The intra-cerebral injection of biologic TNFIs in
experimental stroke is neuroprotective (Barone et al., 1997).
Recently, the BBB-penetrating cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion protein
has been demonstrated to reduce stroke volume in the reversible
mouse MCAO model (Sumbria et al., 2012). The present
work shows that combination intravenous therapy of experimental
stroke is additive, and that the reduction in stroke
volume with the combined use of the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion
protein and the cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion protein produces a
reduction in stroke volume greater than single therapy with
thecTfRMAb–GDNFfusionprotein( Fig. 2). Although there is the
potential for competition for transport on the BBB TfR by the
two different cTfRMAb-derived fusion proteins, such competition
would offset the biological effect of each fusion protein,
and lead to a diminished, not an additive, therapeutic effect.
This was not observed, as the therapeutic effect of combination
fusion protein therapy was greater than the effect from single
therapy with the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein (Fig. 2).
In summary, a BBB-penetrating form of GDNF, such as
the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein, is neuroprotective in a
mouse model of focal ischemia following acute intravenous
administration. Intravenous combination therapy with the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein and the BBB-penetrating TNF-a
inhibitor, the cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion protein, has a more pronounced
therapeutic effect in experimental stroke than the
cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein alone. Concomitant use of
BBB-penetrating neurotrophins and BBB-penetrating biologic

TNFIs may thus hold promise for improved treatment of acute
ischemic stroke.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Fusion proteins
The genetic engineering of the cTfRMAb–GDNF and the
cTfR–TNFR fusion proteins has been previously described
(Zhou et al., 2010, 2011a). Both the fusion proteins were
produced in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells
and purified by protein G affinity chromatography as
described previously (Zhou et al., 2010, 2011a). Human
recombinant GDNF (rGDNF), produced in bacteria, was purchased
from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The cTfRMAb–GDNF
fusion protein was formulated in tris-buffered saline, pH¼5.5
(TBS buffer) and the cTfRMAb–TNFR fusion protein was
formulated in sodium acetate-buffered saline, pH¼6.0 (ABS
buffer).
4.2. Reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAO)
and drug treatment
The reversible MCAO mouse model was used, as previously
described (Sumbria et al., 2012). All procedures were
approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee. Adult
male C57Bl/6J mice (25–33 g) supplied by Jackson Labs (Bar
Harbor, ME) kept under standardized light/dark (12 h), temperature
(25 1C) and humidity (70%) conditions were used for
the MCAO model. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane
(4% for induction and 2% for maintenance) in 30% O
2
. Body
temperature was continuously monitored and maintained
constant at 37 1C throughout the surgical procedure using a
Harvard thermal blanket with a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus
, Inc., Holliston, MA). Mice were placed in a supine
position; a midline incision was made in the neck and the
common carotid artery and external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed. The branches of the ECA, the superior thyroid and
occipital arteries, were electrocoagulated. After occlusion of
the common carotid artery with a microclip, the ECA was
ligated distally to the cranial thyroid artery and an incision
was made in the ECA. A silicon rubber coated 6–0 nylon
monofilament (6021; Doccol Corp., Redlands, CA) was
inserted into the ECA and gently advanced 9–11 mm until
resistance was felt for occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
The filament was secured in placed by ligation for duration of
60 min after which the nylon filament was carefully withdrawn
to allow for reperfusion and the neck incision was
sutured. Mice were euthanized either 23 h or 7 days post
60 min occlusion. Some mice died prematurely and were not
included in the data analysis. The average mortality across all
the groups subjected to 60 min occlusion and 23 h reperfusion
was 7% and no significant difference between different
treatment groups was observed.
4.3. Drug treatment groups
Mice subjected to rMCAO were divided into four treatment
groups: (1) saline, (2) rGDNF (170mg/kg), (3) cTfRMAb–GDNF
(1 mg/kg) and (4) cTfRMAb–GDNF and cTfRMAb–TNFR (1 mg/kg
of each fusion protein) combined. The final concentration of
the treatment in the IV injection solution was 0.25 mg/ml in
TBS buffer for the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein treatment
group, 0.5 mg/ml in TBS or ABS buffer for the combined fusion
protein treatment group and 40mg/ml for the rGDNF treatment
group. For a 1 mg/kg dose of the cTfRMAb–GDNF, GDNF
constitutes 17% of the weight of the fusion protein (Zhou
et al., 2010), which is 170mg/kg on a molar basis. Hence, for a
25 g mouse, the IV injection dose of GDNF was 4mg/mouse.
A total volume of 100ml was injected IV for 25 g mouse via the
tail vein at 45 min post arterial occlusion and these mice were
euthanized 23 h after the 1 h MCAO. To determine if the effects
of the cTfRMAb–GDNF fusion protein were long lasting, in a
separate series, mice were euthanized at 7 days following
rMCAO. For this, treatment was injected 45 min post arterial
occlusion and mice were euthanized 7 days post 60 min
occlusion.
4.4. Infarct volume calculation
After 1 day or 7 days, mice were euthanized; brains were
removed and cut into 2-mm coronal sections with a mouse
brain matrix (Kent Scientific Co., Torrington, CT). The brains
were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO) and fixed overnight
in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO).
TTC stained sections were scanned with a UMAX PowerLook
III flatbed scanner and the images processed in Adobe Photoshop.
The area of either total (hemispheric) or cortical infarct
in each brain section was computed from the difference
between the area of the contralateral hemisphere and the
area of ipsilateral non-infarcted brain using NIH Image J
software 1.62. Total infarct volume (mm3) was computed
from the sum of infarct area for all sections from the same
brain multiplied by the total section thickness (8 mm). Subcortical
infarct volume was calculated as the difference
between the hemispheric and cortical infarct volumes.
4.5. Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean7SEM, and statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. One-way analysis
of variance with Bonferroni’s correction (for more than 2
groups) or student’s t-test (for 2 groups) was used to compare
the means of infarct volume. Statistical significant differences
in the mortality rate were determined using chi-square
or Fisher’s exact test. A po0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
