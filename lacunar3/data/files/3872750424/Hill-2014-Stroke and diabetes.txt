INTRODUCTORYCONCEPTS
Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for stroke.
We can conceptualize some features of diabetes as
a condition of accelerated vascular aging. Because
diabetic patients suffer all types of stroke, a general
understanding of stroke is necessary. Stroke is clinically
recognized and should be thought of syndromically.
It is a syndrome of sudden neurologic symptoms caused
by vascular pathology in the brain or in the vessels
leading to or from the brain. While the understanding
of stroke originally arose from the Greek term,
apoplexy, which has evolved to apply in a limited way
to hemorrhage into a pituitary macroadenoma, stroke
comprises multiple underlying pathologies with multiple
mechanisms. Thus, from a clinical perspective,
stroke is heterogeneous. It is conceived of as a stroke
syndrome and defined by imaging of the brain and
vasculature.
Stroke is divided into ischemic and hemorrhagic
types: (1) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and transient ischemic
attack (TIA); (2) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); (3)
atraumatic or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH); (4) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
Note that intracranial hemorrhage includes ICH but also
epidural and subdural hemorrhage, which are generally
considered as complications of trauma that may present
as stroke mimics. Ischemia is the most common type of
stroke, comprising 85% of all stroke presentations in the
developed world. In south Asia, the proportion is slightly
less (70–75%), with the difference being made up by a
greater proportion of hemorrhage, although it is unclear
if this is due to diagnosis bias or to true differences in
stroke epidemiology. ICH and SAH each make up
7–8% of all strokes and CVST less than 1% of all strokes
(Field et al., 2004).
Cerebrovascular disease also includes vascular
dementia and mixed pathology dementias. It has become
apparent that there is an important relationship between
Alzheimer disease and cerebrovascular changes. There
are links between amyloid pathology and cholesterol
metabolism, between amyloid angiopathy and both
ICH and AIS. The clinical expression of dementia is
heavily influenced by the combination of Alzheimer
pathology (Braak and Braak stage) and ischemic stroke
(Snowdon et al., 1997). Small vessel ischemic disease or
leukoaraiosis is strongly associated with vascular risk
factors (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus
, smoking, etc.) and dementia (see Ch. 11).
CLINICAL FEATURES
Stroke is sudden and maximal at onset. The temporal
profile of symptom onset is a critical feature of the
stroke history. Abrupt onset with symptoms maximal
or close to maximal in a few moments is characteristic.
Symptoms are determined by the location of the brain
involved, or in particular, the location of the arterial or
venous pathology. Because the middle cerebral artery
carries blood to a majority of the brain, middle cerebral
artery syndromes are most common. Typical symptoms
are described as a loss of function or as negative symptoms.
They include motor weakness or paralysis contralateral
to the brain hemisphere affected, aphasia with
dominant hemisphere involvement (usually left) or
hemispatial neglect with nondominant hemisphere
involvement (usually right) and hemi- or quandrantanopsia
contralateral to the affected hemisphere. These three
– motor, speech, vision – are the cardinal symptoms of
stroke, but they are not comprehensive. Anterior cerebral
artery syndromes are associated with dominant
leg weakness and neuropsychological frontal lobe

features such as abulia or akinetic mutism. Less than
10% of strokes involve the anterior cerebral artery.
The posterior cerebral artery leads to occipital lobe syndromes
with dominant loss of vision in the contralateral
hemifield. Posterior cerebral artery strokes are associated
with headache and may also show weakness due
to involvement of the thalamus, internal capsule or
cerebral peduncle, show language impairment if connections
to Wernicke’s area are involved and visual neuropsychological
syndromes such as visual agnosias (e.g.,
prosopagnosia), Ba ´lint syndrome, Anton syndrome,
and others. Approximately 10% of strokes involve the
PCA. Other stroke syndromes can be defined by artery
and include the Wallenberg syndrome (vertebral artery
or posterior inferior cerebellar artery), Weber syndrome
(perforator/small artery affecting the mesencephalon),
anterior choroidal artery syndrome.
Other symptoms may include sensory loss with unilateral
anesthesia. Paresthesiae are typically positive
symptoms and may be less likely to represent stroke,
but patients have trouble describing exactly what they
are experiencing, often because it is a novel experience
for them. Diplopia, dysphagia, and dysarthria, altered
level of consciousness, and ataxia may all occur. General
symptoms may include headache that occurs with both
ischemia and hemorrhage. Thunderclap headache is
associated with SAH, CVST, and occasionally ischemic
infarction with or without arterial dissection. Vomiting,
diaphoresis, tachycardia, apnea, hypertension are very
common in both ischemia and hemorrhage.
Much less commonly symptoms evolve over time.
Large artery (carotid or basilar) atherosclerotic disease
may present in a stuttering fashion with repetitive TIAs.
Acute ICH may present with headache followed by a
rapid evolution of stroke syndrome and reducing level
of consciousness as the mass effect of a growing hematoma
causes subfalcine or transtentorial herniation.
CVST may present with subacute or progressive
symptoms as venous pressure and intracranial pressure
gradually rise or more commonly present with a sudden
ICH or seizure.
In contrast, vascular dementia will evolve over years,
most often subclinically. A discrete clinical stroke may
result in a stepwise sudden deterioration in cognitive
function but this is not the most common evolution.
Apparent stepwise deteriorations can also be misleading
as patients slowly decline to a threshold level of function,
fall below it at a constant rate of decline, but appear to
suddenly get worse. A careful history is required to distinguish
between these two possibilities.
The diagnosis of the stroke syndrome is clinical and is
generally straightforward. Epidemiologically, a sudden
acute neurological deficit in an adult or a child is a stroke
until proven otherwise. However, imaging is the only
means to be certain of the stroke type. Thus, the diagnosis
is characterized clinically and confirmed by brain
imaging.
CAUSES:STROKEMECHANISM
Ischemic stroke
Ischemic stroke and TIA are spectrums of the same disease
and may be classified into subtypes by mechanism.
Ischemic stroke is the end result of multiple possible
underlying conditions. The search for stroke mechanism
is often elusive and 20–30% of patients may not have a
clear mechanism identified despite comprehensive
investigation. This proportion is higher for TIA because
of the transient nature of symptoms. The common
stroke mechanisms are: (1) large artery atherosclerotic
disease; (2) cardioembolism; (3) lacunar or small vessel
disease.
Large artery atherosclerotic disease may involve the
extracranial vessels, carotid and vertebral arteries, and
less commonly the aortic arch and great vessels. The
mechanism of stroke in this instance is commonly arteroembolic
; an arteroembolic plaque ruptures with local
thrombus formation, which then embolizes to the brain.
Less commonly the vessel fully occludes or occludes and
embolizes concurrently. Large artery atherosclerosis
may also involve the intracranial arteries and the mechanism
of stroke may bein situthrombosis on a ruptured
plaque. The common locations for atherosclerotic disease
burden are at the carotid artery bifurcation, the
internal carotid artery siphon, the vertebral artery origin
at the subclavian artery, and the fourth segment of the
vertebral artery. Diabetic patients have a greater propensity
to develop intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Large
artery disease makes up about a 25% of ischemic stroke
syndromes.
Cardioembolic stroke is exemplified by atrial fibrillation
, a state where left atrial appendage thrombus embolizes
to the brain. Other sources of cardioembolic stroke
include mural thrombus postmyocardial infarction or
cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, endocarditis,
or congenital heart disease. Paradoxical embolus from
atrial or ventricular septal abnormalities, such as a patent
foramen ovale, is classified as cardioembolic. Note that
embolism to the brain is much more common compared
to embolism to the splanchnic bed or legs because of both
the proportion of blood that goes to the brain and laminar
flow of blood in the ascending aorta. Cardioembolic
stroke makes up 25–40% of ischemic stroke syndromes.
It is suspected that a significant proportion of so-called
cryptogenic stroke is actually due to unrecognized
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic
sources.

Lacunar stroke (Mohr et al., 1977) or small vessel disease
is commonly seen in diabetics, involves the small
penetrating arteries, and makes up 25% of all ischemic
stroke (Figs. 12.1 and 12.2). A major difficulty with investigating
this cause of stroke is that these arteries are currently
not visualized with noninvasive imaging. This
means that they are currently impossible to study in
the acute phase, something which may change with the
use of very high field (e.g., 7 T) MR imaging. The mechanism
of occlusion is not fully explained, impossible to
investigate, and therefore inferred. Both arteroembolic
and cardioembolic mechanisms may uncommonly
embolize to small penetrating arteries. These arteries
may also have microatheroma with associated plaque
rupture or undergo degenerative lipohyalinosis with
luminal collapse. In original pathological investigations
by Miller-Fisher, microatheroma was the most common
cause of lacunar stroke affecting the internal capsule.
This microatheroma typically occurred in small arteries
ranging from 300 to 800mm in diameter, at locations
where the artery took an abrupt turn. A small number
(20%) had no evidence of occlusion and a presumptive
inference that occlusion may have been due to an
embolic source was made (Fisher, 1979).
Lacunar stroke is defined pathologically as a small,
deep infarct 15 mm or less in maximal diameter. That
definition has been adapted for acute MR imaging to
20 mm or less on diffusion-weighted MR images
(Fig. 12.1). The distribution of lacunar stroke is a function
of arterial anatomy. Small penetrating arteries arise
vertically off the main middle cerebral artery stem to
perfuse the basal ganglia, internal capsule and overlying
corona radiata (Fig. 12.2). Similar arteries project anteriorly
and posteriorly from the posterior cerebral artery,
medially and superiorly from the posterior communicating
artery to perfuse the thalamus and upper mesencephalon.
Direct perforators arise posteriolaterally and
radially from the basilar artery to perfuse the brainstem.
Accordingly, lacunar infarcts typically affect the corona
radiata, basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, mesencephalon
, and pons. Classic syndromes arise because
of lesion location: (1) pure motor stroke; (2) pure sensory
stroke; (3) clumsy hand–dysarthria syndrome; (4) ataxic
hemiparesis; (5) sensorimotor stroke, and others. The
“capsular warning” syndrome is a classic stroke presentation
with fluctuating ischemia to the corticospinal tract
in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.

Other known causes of ischemic stroke include
arterial dissection, vasculitis or vasculopathy, and hypercoagulable
states. Cryptogenic strokes, or strokes of
undetermined cause may make up 25–40% of all strokes.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
While the commonest cause of SAH is trauma, in atraumatic
SAH the usual cause is a ruptured saccular aneurysm
in the circle of Willis. Dissecting aneurysms may
also cause proximal bleeding. Less commonly, superficial
SAH may be caused by mycotic aneurysms, amyloid
angiopathy, cortical vein thrombosis, or arterial malformations.
Diabetic patients are not especially prone
to SAH.
Intracerebral hemorrhage
ICH can be divided anatomically into lobar and deep
types. Lobar hemorrhage is commonly considered hemorrhage
that is focused on the gray–white junction and
coming within 1 cm of the cortical surface. Lobar hemorrhage
is commonly due to amyloid angiopathy and
occurs in older patients. Deep or subcortical hemorrhage
occurs and is focused upon the thalamus, basal ganglia,
deep cerebellar nuclei, or pons. Typically hypertension is
the underlying cause. Diabetic patients are more prone to
deep subcortical ICH.
EPIDEMIOLOGYANDRISK FACTORS
Stroke occurs twice as often in people with diabetes compared
to people without diabetes. Diabetic patients have
a risk of stroke similar to people without diabetes who
are 15 years older. In most hospitalized series of stroke
victims, up to 20% of subjects have diabetes mellitus.
Diabetic patients are prone to small vessel disease, but
diabetes is not an exclusive risk factor for this condition.
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for
stroke, even among diabetic patients. The largest magnitude
of effect is for ICH but hypertension is still the most
important risk factor for ischemia as well. Hypertension
has a much smaller effect as a risk factor for SAH. Diabetic
patients are particular prone to develop hypertension
, either as part of the entire metabolic syndrome
or associated with comorbid diabetic nephropathy. By
the time strokes occur among diabetic patients, a large
majority are already hypertensive.
Dyslipidemias are a strong risk factor for atherosclerotic
disease but are of lesser importance in stroke compared
to coronary artery disease. Reducing cholesterol
with statins does reduce the risk of stroke overall but
with a small effect size. Cholesterol reduction among
patients with stroke has a strong effect on reducing
future myocardial infarction (Collins et al., 2004);
cholesterol reduction is relevant particularly for stroke
patients with proven large artery disease in the carotid
or vertebral arteries (Amarenco et al., 2006). Interestingly
, very low LDL cholesterol may be a risk factor
for ICH and reduction to a very low LDL cholesterol
level with atorvastatin was associated with a numerical
increase in the risk of ICH in the SPARCL trial
(Goldstein et al., 2008).
Other well-known lifestyle risk factors for arterial
disease and stroke include tobacco smoking, sedentary
lifestyle, obesity, high-fat and high-sodium diet, elevated
serum homocysteine, alcohol abuse, sympathomimetic
drug use (cocaine, ecstasy, nasal decongestants) and
life-stress. Risk states for stroke include atrial fibrillation
, carotid artery stenosis, and obstructive sleep apnea.
Many of these factors are highly correlated and are frequently
comorbid with diabetes mellitus and the metabolic
syndrome.
Epidemiologically, patients with diabetes suffer complications
of small vessel disease – both deep ICH and
lacunar stroke. Among a population-based epidemiological
study, the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study,
patients with lacunar ischemic stroke were more likely
to be diabetic than those with deep ICH (RR 3.0, 95%
CI 1.4–6.7). Hypertension was equally prevalent.
ACUTESTROKE:SPECIAL
CONSIDERATIONSIN DIABETIC
PATIENTS
Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for stroke and
macrovascular disease. Diabetic patients suffer stroke
of all types and are at ongoing risk for both AIS and
ICH. Commonly they have multiple comorbid risk factors
, such as hypertension associated with diabetic
nephropathy, predisposing them to both hemorrhagic
and ischemic forms of stroke.
Hyperglycemia is a strong negative prognostic factor
in acute stroke, both ischemic stroke and ICH, and this
appears to be true for both diabetics and nondiabetics.
There is a great deal of experimental evidence in preclinical
stroke models to support the concept that hyperglycemia
results in infarct extension and poor metabolic
tolerance to ischemic and hemorrhagic injury. In preclinical
models, hyperglycemia is associated with larger
infarct size and worse neurobehavioral outcomes, but
results vary by model. Further, the relationship is complicated
: the stroke itself may result in hyperglycemia due
to alterations in sympathetic tone (Allport et al., 2004;
Pettersen et al., 2006).
Patients with serum glucose greater than 8 mM
(140 mg/dL) have a greater likelihood of death and suffer
more complications after acute stroke. There is a
greater risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation

after acute thrombolytic therapy (Demchuk et al., 1999;
Bruno et al., 2002; Poppe et al., 2009)(Fig. 12.3). Thrombolysis
may not be as effective among patients with
hyperglycemia (Martini et al., 2006). This has led to calls
for treatment of hyperglycemia in acute stroke, but to
date, there is simply no strong evidence to support this
treatment approach.
The Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial (GIST-UK) did not
show benefit of a glucose-insulin-potassium infusion in
acute stroke (Scott et al., 1999; Gray et al., 2007). The pilot
Glucose Regulation in Acute Stroke Patients (GRASP)
and Treatment of Hyperglycemia in Ischemic Stroke
(THIS) trials (Bruno et al., 2008; Johnston et al., 2009)
have led to a phase III multicenter study in the US, the
Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE)
study, funded by the NINDS [NCT01369069]. The SHINE
trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical
trial of 1400 patients that will include approximately
60 enrolling sites. The study hypotheses are that treatment
of hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patients
with targeted glucose concentration (80–130 mg/dL or
4.4–7.2 mM) will be safe and result in improved 3 month
outcome after stroke measured on the modified Rankin
Scale. This study is ongoing with results expected in late
2018. Knowing past outcomes, which assessed glucoselowering
among patients with myocardial infarction, in
pediatric cardiac surgery (Agus et al., 2012), and critical
care patients (Brunkhorst et al., 2008; NICE-SUGAR
Study Investigators et al., 2009), all of which have ultimately
concluded that very tight control of glycemia does
not clearly improve outcomes, many are skeptical that the
SHINE trial will be positive. Current guidelines
recommend that it is reasonable, based upon expert opinion
, to treat hyperglycemia in the acute phase but there is
no definitive evidence of efficacy on clinical outcomes
(Lindsay et al., 2012; Jauch et al., 2013).
The acute treatment of ischemic stroke and ICH does
not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
Thrombolysis is offered to diabetic patients according
to standard clinical criteria. Expectant management on
a stroke unit is possibly more important for diabetic
patients, as they have a greater propensity to infection
and other complications of stroke.
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is not specifically
more or less common among diabetic patients. In
selected circumstances, type 1 diabetic patients may be
more prone. The extreme dehydration that can occur
in hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma or in diabetic
ketoacidosis may predispose to venous sinus thrombosis.
Because diabetic patients may be slightly more prone to
some infections, such as sinus infection, they may suffer
venous sinus thrombosis as a complication of mastoiditis
, sphenoid sinusitis, or more rarely Lemierre syndrome
or septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (Keane
et al., 2002; De Keyzer et al., 2004; Sasiadek et al., 2006).
STROKEPREVENTION:SPECIAL
CONSIDERATIONSIN DIABETIC
PATIENTS
Most strokes are mild to moderate, leaving stroke victims
with risk of a future event. Diabetic patients of
all age groups have approximately twice the chance of
stroke compared to nondiabetics. This is true for both

ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke (ICH and SAH)
but the risk of ischemic stroke is higher than hemorrhagic
forms of stroke (ICH and SAH).
Diabetic patients have a greater tendency to suffer
lacunar stroke and show evidence of small vessel ischemic
disease. This may be due to the very high likelihood
of significant comorbid hypertension among diabetic
patients, but is also probably due to diabetes-specific
involvement of the small penetrating arteries and arterioles.
Type 1 diabetic patients with associated diabetic
nephropathy have an increased risk of stroke (Hagg
et al., 2013). The same has been observed in those with
diabetic retinopathy (Petitti and Bhatt, 1995). This translates
into a higher prevalence of small vessel ischemic
disease or silent leukoaraiosis. Diabetes is a risk factor
for progression of leukoaraiosis (Gouw et al., 2008).
In the SPS3 trial, a study examining stroke prevention
among patients with small subcortical strokes, 37% of
the population had overt diabetes mellitus, nearly double
that observed in acute stroke trials (SPS3 Study
Investigators et al., 2012; SPS3 Study Group et al., 2013).
While it has been shown that aggressive treatment to
achieve normoglycemia reduces retinal disease
(Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research
Group, 1993; ACCORD Study Group et al., 2010a),
nephropathy, as shown by reduced microalbuminuria
(Patel et al., 2007), and probably neuropathy, the evidence
that it reduces macrovascular complications of
diabetes (coronary artery disease, stroke) remains limited
(Duckworth et al., 2009). Long-term follow-up of
the DCCT and UKPDS studies suggested that there
may be a “legacy effect” of early aggressive treatment:
patients treated early and aggressively may show a long
term (>10 years) reduction in macrovascular complications
of diabetes (Chalmers and Cooper, 2008). However
, this was not confirmed in the Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study.
Aggressive treatment of patients with well-established
diabetes mellitus may actually result in worse outcomes
and increased death (ACCORD Study Group et al.,
2010c). Myocardial infarction was reduced at 5 years
but there was increased mortality (ACCORD Study
Group et al., 2011). Similarly, combination glucose lowering
and cholesterol reduction improved diabetic retinopathy
(ACCORD Study Group et al., 2010a, b), akin
to the DCCT. Stroke was reduced with aggressive blood
pressure control but this effect was offset by other
adverse outcomes (ACCORD Study Group et al.,
2010c). Overall, there was more harm with aggressive
blood sugar control targeting an HbA1c less than 6%
compared to usual care.
Other important outcomes such as dementia or its
predecessor, mild cognitive impairment, have not been
adequately studied in randomized trials. It is simply
not known if aggressive management of hyperglycemia
would translate into a reduced risk of clinical dementia.
It is also challenging to study because the outcome of
clinical dementia is a long-term one. Other important
microvascular and macrovascular outcomes occur
before or at a more rapid rate than dementia, making
it unethical to deny patients effective therapies.
Novel agents (e.g., glitazars) were not tested in the
UKPDS and ACCORD studies. These agents show
promise in addressing the metabolic syndrome and it
remains to be seen if differing insulin types, novel oral
hypoglycemic agents may show improved clinical outcomes.
A long-term study, the Insulin Resistance Intervention
for Stroke (IRIS) trial (NCT00091949), is fully
recruited and is examining pioglitazone and stroke prevention
among patients with elevated levels of basal
insulin without frank diabetes mellitus.
Without specific evidence that stroke prevention measures
show effect modification by diabetic status, general
measures are applicable. Guidelines reflect the general
approach to managing risk factors (Furie et al., 2011;
Lindsay et al., 2012). Stroke prevention among patients
with diabetes should focus upon both (1) risk states and
(2) risk factors. Atrial fibrillation and carotid artery stenosis
are risk states. Atrial fibrillation should be sought and
anticoagulation initiated. Patients with symptomatic
carotid artery stenosis should be offered carotid revascularization.
There is, in contrast, no specific evidence that
performing carotid revascularization among diabetic
patients with no recent symptoms (asymptomatic carotid
artery stenosis) is beneficial.
Comorbid risk factors should be aggressively treated.
The most important risk factor to treat is hypertension.
While a target systolic blood pressure of less than
130 mmHg has been identified in most hypertension
guidelines based upon the HOT trial and other supportive
evidence, the actual benefit of lowering BP from a
target of 140 to a target of 130 is likely to be small.
The SPS3 study showed strong trends of efficacy favoring
the 130 mmHg target but did not statistically show an
overall benefit (SPS3 Study Group et al., 2013). Thus, the
effect size may be smaller than previously anticipated.
An aggressive approach to lowering cholesterol is warranted
with a target LDL-C less than 2.0 mM. The benefit
isinreductionof coronary artery disease riskrather than a
substantial stroke reduction gain (Collins et al., 2004). Use
of single antiplatelet agent therapy is recommended for
all patients who have suffered a past stroke. Double
antiplatelet therapy (ASA plus clopidogrel) is useful for
the short term after a TIA or minor stroke, but in the
long term is associated with a greater risk of hemorrhage,
particularly gastrointestinal hemorrhage (Diener et al.,
2004; SPS3 Investigators et al., 2012). A large randomized
trial, the Aspirin and simvastatin Combination for

Cardiovascular Events Prevention Trial in Diabetes
(ACCEPT-D) study (ISRCTN48110081), is ongoing,
examining whether among asymptomatic patients (without
prior stroke or cardiovascular disease) with diabetes
and taking simvastatin, ASA 100 mg daily is an effective
preventive therapy for vascular disease.
General stroke prevention lifestyle measures including
stopping smoking, maintaining an ideal weight, an
active lifestyle, and avoiding the overuse of alcohol
and any use of sympathomimetic drugs (both illicit
and over-the-counter) will reduce stroke risk.
CONCLUSIONS
Diabetes has a profound negative effect on the macrovasculature
and is a potent stroke risk factor. However,
there is no current evidence that there are treatment-bydiabetes
interactions to suggest that specific treatments
apply. There are no clear treatments that specifically target
the disease and are associated with stroke risk reduction.
Treatment for both acute stroke and strategies for
stroke prevention remain generic in this population. The
future, however, may be promising. An array of new
compounds have been brought to market to treat diabetes
and we await further data that support treatment of
the underlying problem as an effective preventive measure
for cerebrovascular disease.
