MRI CHARACTERISTICS OF CEREBRAL MICROBLEEDS IN FOUR DOGS
CAROLINEV. FULKERSON,B ENJAMIND. YOUNG,N ICOLETTED. JACKSON,B RIANPORTER,J ONATHANM. LEVINE
Cerebral microbleeds in people are small foci of hemosiderin-containing macrophages in normal brain
parenchyma. They are the remnant of previous hemorrhage and occur with greater frequency in older individuals.
Our purpose was to describe the magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of cerebral microbleeds
in four dogs. These lesions appeared as round, hypointense foci measuring≤4 mm on T2*-gradient-recalled
echo images. They were less conspicuous or absent on T2-weighting, being iso- or hypointense, and uniformly
invisible on T1-weighted images. No contrast enhancement was seen in any of the cerebral microbleeds.
Necropsy-derived histopathologic analysis of one brain confirmed these lesions to be chronic cerebrocortical
infarcts containing hemosiderin. The MR changes seen in dogs were analogous to what has been described in
people and will be helpful in distinguishing cerebral microbleeds from other brain lesions. C  2012 Veterinary

Introduction
Thetermintracerebralhemorrhageisabroaddescriptor
that refers to hemorrhage into the brain parenchyma
orsubarachnoidspace.Inpeople,largesingleareasofintraparenchymal
brain hemorrhage typically result from either
cardiovascular accidents or infarcts.1 Hemorrhagic cardiovascular
accidents are usually secondary to hypertension or
aneurysm rupture whereas hemorrhagic infarction occurs
due to reperfusion of a blood vessel that has received endothelial
damage from a thromboembolus.2,3 Other causes
of intracranial hemorrhage are less common.1,3–7
One pattern of intracranial hemorrhage described in
people is termed cerebral microbleeds, which are small
foci of hemosiderin-containing macrophages in normal
brain parenchyma.8–11 The hemosiderin deposits are from
past hemorrhage, presumably due to leakage from damaged
small vessels.8,10–12 These characteristically appear as
homogeneous, round foci of hypointense signal intensity
on T2*-weighted gradient recalled-echo (T2*-GRE) magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging.9,10,12,13 In humans, cerebral
microbleeds are seen with normal aging.14,15 Cerebral
microbleeds have a prevalence as low as 6.5% in people

and older.11,16 The prevalence increases with intracranial
hemorrhage or ischemic stroke, reportedly up to 70%.9,11
One in five patients with Alzheimer’s disease has cerebral
microbleeds.15Our goal was to describe the features of cerebral
microbleeds in four dogs.
Materials and Methods
Medical records of all dogs that had brain MR imaging
between March 2007 and November 2010 were
identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) presence of small
(<5 mm), round, well-marginated signal voids within the
brain parenchyma on T2*-GRE MR images; (2) absence of
signal changes in brain parenchyma immediately surrounding
T2*-GRE signal voids; (3) normal cerebrospinal fluid
analysis; and (4) negative infectious disease testing including
serology for Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia rickettsia, Bartonella
spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, Toxoplasma gondii, and
Neospora caninum as well as blood or urine polymerase
chain reaction for canine distemper virus. Additionally,
dogs were required to have a necropsy confirming the presence
of cerebral microbleeds or lack of neurologic progression
over a minimum of 3 months. Signalment, time from
onset of clinical signs to MR imaging (days), concurrent
medical conditions, survival to discharge (yes/no), and final
diagnosis were recorded. The onset of clinical signs was
defined by the date of the first owner-reported intracranial
neurologic sign.
Four dogs fit the inclusion criteria. Breeds included one
each of the following: Beagle, Collie, Miniature Schnauzer,
and Shetland Sheepdog. Median age was 13.25 years (range
11–15 years). Two of the dogs were neutered males, one was
a neutered female, and one was an intact female.

FIG. 1. Transverse magnetic resonance (MR) images of three adult dogs (A = Dog 1, B = Dog 2, C = Dog 3). Transverse T2-weighted (T2-W) (right
column) and T2*-weighted (left column, *) of the forebrain were made at different levels. Cerebral microbleeds appear on T2*-weighting as small foci of low
signal (black arrowheads). Little or no signal change is seen in corresponding areas on T2-W.
MR imaging was performed using a 1.0T unit.∗ Sequences
were: pre- and postcontrast spin echo T1-weighted
images (TI-W; repetition time [TR] 532–654 ms; echo time
[TE] 15 ms), spin echo T2-weighted images (T2-W; TR
3500–4000 ms; TE 45 ms), T2-weighted fluid attenuated
inversion recovery, and T2*-GRE (TR 760–920 ms; TE
26 ms).
All images were reviewed independently in digital format
by the primary author (C.V.F.), a board-certified radiologist
(B.D.Y.), and a board-certified neurologist (J.M.L.).
Any discrepancies between reviewers had a final resolution

reached by group consensus. Lesions were defined as areas
of signal void on the T2*-GRE sequences. The number
and diameter of each lesion was measured on the GRE
sequences. The following MR imaging characteristics were
evaluated: mass effect, perilesional edema, signal intensity
relative to surrounding tissue on T1-W and T2-W images,
tissue predilection, and contrast enhancement.
Results
A total of 28 lesions were seen and multiple hemorrhagic
lesionswerepresentinalldogs(Figs.1and2).OnT2*-GRE
images, cerebral microbleeds measured 1 mm (15 lesions),
2 mm (8 lesions), or 3 mm (5 lesions). No mass effect or

FIG. 2. Transverse magnetic resonance (MR) images (A–D) and gross transverse section (E) at the level of the thalamus of an adult dog (Dog 4). A cerebral
microbleed is present in the right temporal lobe near the junction of gray and white matter (black arrowhead). The lesion is hypointense on T2*-weighting (C)
and to a lesser extent T2-weighted (T2-W) (D). The cerebral microbleed can be distinguished from hematomas in the right parietal lobe (white arrowhead) and
thalamus (white arrow), both of which have faint precontrast T1-weighted (T1-W) signal change (A; hypointense core with faint hyperintense rim in thalamic
lesion, hyperintense parietal lesion), contrast enhancement (B), and blood accumulation grossly (E). The thalamic lesion has perilesional T2-hyperintensity
consistent with edema. The cerebral microbleed is not visible on the T1-W image and was consistent histologically with chronic hemorrhagic.

lesions were T2-hypointense while the remaining 20 lesions
were T2-isointense (Fig. 2). Lesions were in gray matter
only in one dog (1) while the other three dogs had lesions
in both gray and white matter (2–4) (Table 1). No cerebral
microbleed had contrast enhancement.
Two of the four dogs had additional abnormal findings.
Dog 1 had mild forebrain cortical atrophy as evidenced by
narrowing of the gyri and increased depth and width of the
sulci. At time of MR imaging, dog 1 had a clinical diagnosis
of cognitive dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Neurologic
signs had been present for a year before MR imaging was
performed. This patient was diagnosed 4 months subsequent
to MR imaging with multicentric lymphoma; at the
time of euthanasia, neurologic signs remained nonprogressive.
Dog 2 had no other brain lesions and was diagnosed
with generalized neuromuscular disease and seizures. Concurrent
medical conditions were osteoarthritis and hypertension.
The time of onset of clinical signs to MR imaging
was 2 days.
Dog 3 had no other brain lesions and was diagnosed with
generalized weakness, severe muscle atrophy, and seizures.
Concurrent medical conditions were hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism
,andvaginitis.Neurologicsignsbegan9
days before MR imaging with one isolated seizure 5 months
prior to presentation.
Dog 4 had two additional MR brain lesions, and both
werehemorrhagicasindicatedbystrongsignalvoidonT2*-
GRE. The largest was in the thalamus with broad contact
to the sella turcica and had high perilesional T2 signal.
The other lesion was in the gray matter of the right parietal
lobe and was faintly T1- and T2-hyperintense with contrast
enhancement.MRimagingofthespinalcordsegmentsC1–
C3 was unremarkable. This patient had cervical pain with a
history of osteoarthritis. Time of onset of neurologic signs
to MR imaging was 3 days.
Three of the four dogs survived until discharge. Dog
1 was euthanized due to complications from lymphoma
unrelated to neurologic disease 4 months after MR imaging.
Dog 2 was alive at publication with no progression
of neurologic disease at 6 months post-MR imaging. Dog
3 was euthanized 3 months after the MR imaging due to
multiplesystemicdiseases,includingseverebacterialvaginitis
, hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, severe muscle
atrophy, and generalized weakness. Dog 4 was euthanized,
and a necropsy was performed. Grossly, the cerebral microbleeds
were multiple 1–2 mm areas of tan to dark red
discoloration in the cerebral cortex along the gray-white
matter junction. Histologically, these lesions ranged from
discrete, cavitated areas containing extravasated erythrocytes
(hematoma)tospongioticandglioticareascontaining
reactive astrocytes, a small amount of mineral, and numerous
macrophages containing abundant hemosiderin and
hematoidin. The larger lesion in the thalamus was composed
largely of extravasated erythrocytes surrounded by
fibrovascular tissue and was interpreted as an organizing
hematoma. It was concluded that hemorrhage from this lesion
likely resulted in the acute onset of neurologic signs.
The right parietal lesion was consistent with a hematoma.
Hemorrhage was also evident in the mesencephalic aqueduct
and fourth ventricle as well as the pancreas and cecum.
Nodular hyperplasia was found in the adrenal cortices.
Discussion
The cerebral microbleeds were characterized as multiple,
small, round, homogenous lesions that measured ≤4mm
in diameter on GRE sequences. Hemorrhage can be diagnosed
uniquely on MR imaging because blood breakdown
products are paramagnetic.4 The transformation
of a hematoma ends with iron storage as ferritin and
hemosiderin within macrophages. This end stage can be
present within days after onset and can last indefinitely.
At MR field strengths that range between 1T and1.5T, ferritin
and hemosiderin are T1-iso- to T1-hypointense and
T2-hypointense.4
T2*-GRE sequences are the most sensitive for detecting
brainhemorrhageduetothe increasedsensitivityto paramagnetic
constituents.4Hemorrhage will appear hypointense
on T2*-GRE sequences at certain stages of breakdown, but
many things can mimic hemorrhage including mineralization
, gas, fibrous tissue, or iron deposits.5,17Mineralization,
gas, and fibrous tissue would all be expected to be T1- and
T2-hypointense, which was not evident in these patients.

unrelated to mass effect or contrast enhancement are referred
to as cerebral microbleeds in humans.8–11,13–16,18
Cerebral microbleeds are a radiologic construct but
are telling of specific microscopic pathological changes.
Hemosiderin deposits from RBCs are often perivascular
and are presumed to have leaked out of small
vessels.8–11,13–15 Cerebral microbleeds are found commonly
in patients diagnosed with stroke (ischemic 34% and hemorrhagic
60%), are present in the general population at
a prevalence of 5%, and have an incidence that increases
with age.15,16 Hypertension is the leading cause of intracranial
hemorrhage.3,19 Chronic hypertension leads to
lipohyalinosis of the small intraparenchymal arteries, resulting
in arterial rupture and intracranial hemorrhage.3,19
There is an association between cerebral microbleeds and
asymptomatic stages of age-associated small-vessel disease,
such as hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid
angiopathy.8,9 The etiopathogenesis of cerebral microbleeds
seems to determine the location of lesions, with cerebral
amyloid angiopathy resulting in lobar microbleeds and
hypertension leading to nonlobar microbleeds.18 Cerebral
amyloid angiopathy is deposition of amyloid in the walls
of medium- and small-sized leptomeningeal and cortical
arteries.20 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy increases with age
andhasbeendocumentedtocauseintracranialhemorrhage
in the elderly. Intracerebral hemorrhage is described infrequently
in animals.
Intracranial hemorrhage in people refers to hemorrhage
within the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space resulting
from rupture of a blood vessel. A hemorrhagic
infarct results from blood vessel occlusion, typically due
to an embolism.3 Several mechanisms are described that
can lead to intracranial hemorrhage in humans, includinghypertension
,vascularmalformations,tumors,bleeding
disorders, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vasculitis, sympathomimetic
agents, hemorrhagic infarcts, and trauma.3,4
Similar mechanisms for intracranial hemorrhage have been
described in animals including congenital vascular abnormalities
, neoplasia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, vasculitis,
impaired coagulation, and spontaneous rupture of vasculature
(reported as rare in dogs).1,5–7 Hemorrhage has been
associated with ischemic infarcts in dogs.5,7,21 Hypertension
is thought to be a cause of intracranial hemorrhage in
dogs and is often related to underlying chronic renal disease
and/or hyperadrenocorticism.7,21 In a group of dogs with
cerebellar infarction, one had multiple pinpoint foci of low
signal on GRE images that were thought to be similar to
the cerebral microbleeds seen in people.5 Cerebral amyloid
angiopathy develops naturally as dogs age beyond 13 years,
particularly affecting the leptomeningeal arteries, and this
change has been positively associated with the incidence of
intracranial hemorrhage.20
As cerebral microbleeds have been described poorly
in animals, they may be under-recognized. The MR signal
pattern in these four dogs was analogous to that reported
for people.8–10,13–15,18 Recognition of cerebral microbleeds
may prevent the erroneous diagnosis of other
conditions.
