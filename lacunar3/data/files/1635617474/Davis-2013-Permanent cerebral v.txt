Introduction
Inordertoinduceischemicconditionsthateffectivelymimichumanischemicstroke,severalanimalstrokemodelsarewidelyemployed,with
varying volumes of infarct resulting. In the photothrombotic model, the brain is irradiated through the intact skull using laser illumination after
intravenous injection of a photosensitive substance (such as rose-bengal), resulting in photochemical coagulation, blockage of the irradiated
vessels, and ischemia within the surrounding tissue 
6,7
. Photothrombosis can result in very small, isolated regions of infarct and is typically used
as a means of modeling "mini-strokes", or "micro-strokes".
The more widely adopted technique for inducing ischemic stroke, particularly in middle cerebral artery (MCA), is the intraluminal monofilament
model 
8
, in which a filament is surgically introduced into the external carotid artery and advanced until the tip occludes the base of MCA. A
primarychallengeofintraluminalfilamentocclusionisthehighmortalityrate(70%whenMCAisoccludedfor3hr,arelevanttimepointforstroke
research) 
9
. Other issues with the method included possible subarachnoid hemorrhage, incomplete occlusion, and variable infarct volume 
10,11
.
This model results in an extensive degree of infarct both in the cortex and subcortically 
12
, and models a massive human stroke.
Although both micro and massive stroke models are important, human strokes are typically somewhere in between. In large clinical studies,
stroke infarct ranges in size from 28-80 cm
3
, which translates to 4.5-14% of the ipsi-ishemic hemisphere 
9
. In comparison, our rat pMCAO infarct
size ranges from approximately 9-35 mm
3
, which constitutes 3 to 12% of the ipsi-ishemic hemisphere. Our pMCAO model, therefore, closely
resembles human ischemic stroke infarct volumes by percentage of brain volume.
In addition to modeling the structural damage of stroke, pMCAO results in functional and behavioral deficits similar to the human condition. At

subcortical damage) occurs 
26,27
 (Figure 2). Although human stroke often involves subcortical infarct, modeling this in rodents requires increased
invasiveness (occluding cerebral vessels prior to cortical branching requires accessing arteries via the carotid artery in the neck and necessitates
additional occlusions) in technique and increased variability in infarct size. The model described here cannot be performed more proximally as
access to earlier branches of MCA is not possible viaasimplecraniotomy.Whileitmaybesurgicallypossibletoinduceasubcorticalinfarctvia

 (Figure 3), or histologically post-mortem (Figure
2). It should be noted that previous research has shown that sensory stimulation can play a major role in the evolution and outcome of infarct;
conferring protection from damage when administered within 2 hr of pMCAO and causing an increase in stroke damage when administered
at 3 hr post pMCAO

It should be further noted that occasional variation in MCA structure, including excessive branching, multiple primary segments, or the absence
of communicating arteries can occur at a frequency of 10 to 30% in male adult Sprague Dawley rats

In conclusion, this method for permanent occlusion as applied to MCA closely models three primary facets of human ischemic stroke: the most
common location (MCA), type (ischemia), and degree of damage (infarct) associated with the human clinical literature of stroke. Furthermore,
this method of occlusion may be applied to single or multiple occlusion sites throughout the brain, and may be conducted in aged subjects with a
high rate of survival. Given the dynamic, permanent, and relatively noninvasive nature of this occlusion, this technique represents an additional
tool for preclinical researchers evaluating novel approaches for the protection from and treatment of stroke.

2.CreatingtheSurgicalWindow
1. Anesthesia: Procedures are in compliance with NIH guidelines and have been approved by UC Irvine Animal Care and Use Committee.
Experimental subjects are 295-400 g male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) and the following
anesthesia procedure should be used:
1. Injectratintraperitoneallywithasodiumpentobarbitalbolus(55mg/kgb.w.)followedbyanintramuscularinjectionofatropine(0.05mg/
kg,b.w.)inthehindleg,andadministered3.0ccof5%dextroseinwatersubcutaneously.
2. Supplementsodiumpentobarbital(27.5mg/kg,b.w.)injectionsasnecessary.Administeranophthalmicantibioticointmenttotheeyes
toprotectthecorneasduringthefollowingprocedures.Administer5%dextrose(3ml)andatropine(0.05mg/kg,b.w.)everysixhours
decrease respiratory secretions during anesthesia. Measure body temperature via a rectal probe, and maintain body temperature at 37
°C by a self-regulating thermal blanket.
2. Locate the MCA by either:
a. Thinning a 2 x 2 mm imaging/visualizing window over the somatosensory cortex using a size HP 3 drill bit until the skull is nearly
transparent and then thinning to full transparency using a size HP 2 drill bit. MCA's location can then be seen through this window and
its proximal trajectory used to approximate the location of the initial segment. MCA will generally run diagonally across this window in a
rostral to caudal/ventral to dorsal direction (for example, left to right/bottom to top when viewing left hemisphere from surgeon's point of
view). The surgical window can then be created above where the observer estimates the M1 segment (proximal to cortical branching)
tobelocatedbasedonthedistalbranchesvisiblethroughthefirstwindow.Inordertominimizetheamountofskullthatisremovedin
ordertogainaccesstoMCA,theimaging/visualizingwindowshouldbepositionedcloseto,butseparatefromthesurgicalwindow.
Or
b. A small surgical window should be positioned approximately 3 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral to the foramen ovale or the mandibular
nerve, close to the arch rostrum 
30,33,34
.InordertoeffectivelyaccessthestemoftheMCA(alsoknownastheM1segment),the
temporalis muscle is temporarily reflected away from the skull surface. (Note: In the case of long-term survival surgeries, our lab's
experiencehasbeenthatbyallowingthetemporalismuscletoremainattachedatitsanchor,themusclewillre-annealtotheskull

3. Follow MCA to the rostral, ventral corner of the imaging window (if using this as a reference) in order to estimate where its initial cortical
branch lies.
4. Create a new thin-skull region (we refer to this as the surgical window) slightly rostral and ventral to the imaging window (if using this as
areference)wheretheM1segment(pre-corticalbranching)ofMCAshouldbe.IMPORTANTNOTE:Leaveapproximatelya2mmgap
betweentheimagingwindow(ifusingthisasareference)andthesurgicalwindow.
5. Locate the stem of the MCA (also known as the M1 segment) just before cortical branching of the artery as shown in Figures 1A and 1B.
6. Using a size HP-3 drill bit, thin the skull above the estimated M1 segment location. When the skull becomes somewhat transparent, switch to
the more delicate size HP-2 drill bit and thin the skull until it is completely transparent. Confirm visually as surgical window area becomes thin
enough to view vasculature, and assess the location of M1 at this point and complete the window such that there is 2-3 mm on either side of
the length of the M1 segment (this allows room for insertion and exit of the suture needle on either side of MCA).
IMPORTANTNOTE:Stop thinning when the thickness of the skull is similar to that of plastic wrap. The vessel will rupture if the drill breaks

9. Takeanew30Gneed,benditstipasinStep6,andcarefullyremovethedura.
NOTE: Cutting the dura will cause it to peel back and MCA will become more prominent, as a result of reduced pressure.
3. Occluding the MCA
1. Use wire cutters to trim a half-curve reverse cutting suture needle (round 3/8, 16 mm suture needle) down to about 3-5 mm.
2. Thread the trimmed suture needle as shown in the picture in Figure4E.IMPORTANTNOTE: It is important that the needle is threaded so
both ends of the suture thread are of equivalent length. This enables the pulling of both thread ends under M1 at the same time, the needle
can then be cut free leaving two lengths of thread to tie the two knots around MCA.
3. Use the serrated the tweezers slip the suture needle under M1. Insert with about 0.5-1 mm distance from MCA, staying as shallow as
possible so as to minimize damage to the cortex but avoiding too much strain on MCA as well.
4. When the suture needle comes out the other side such that it is under MCA, use a fine tip tweezer (as shown below) to pull the tip of the
suture needle from the opposite side while continuing to feed or pushing the other end of the suture needle with the serrated tip tweezers.
5. Once the suture needle is completely passed under MCA and has been pulled out, continue to pull on the suture needle or thread until the
length of the thread is equal on either side of MCA. Pressing down on the thread as it is fed through to minimize strain on MCA can be helpful
topreventruptureasthethreadpassesundertheartery.
6. Cut the thread close to the suture needle.
7. Use both fine point tweezers to untangle the two resulting suture threads so that there are two independent threads strung under MCA that
are not touching. Ideally the threads will be about 1 mm apart where they pass under MCA.
8. Use both fine point tweezers to tie two separate knots (two ligatures) with the threads around MCA attempting to maintain that ~1 mm of
space between the knots to allow room for transection.

9. Once the knots have been pulled tight, use the micro scissors to transect M1 in between the two knots.
10.In the case of long-term, survival studies:
a. Suture incised scalp flap back in place with sterile surgical thread or secure the tissue using sterile wound clips.
b. Administer antibiotics locally to the wound area (such as bacitracin ointment) and systemically by prophylactic injection of ampicillin
(150 mg/kg IM).
c. While the subject is still anesthetized administer an ophthalmic antibiotic ointment to the eyes.
d. Administer supplemental atropine (0.05 mg/kg IM) to decrease respiratory secretions during anesthesia.

Representative Results
Successful occlusion of a vessel can be confirmed using laser speckle imaging (LSI) among other blood flow imaging techniques. Blood flow
in the major cortical branches of MCA should drop to ~25% of baseline or less following occlusion depending on the level of noise in the
recording system and sensitivity of the technique. See Figure 3 for a representative LSI image of a segment of a cortical branch of MCA before
and after MCA occlusion. When the described occlusion technique is applied to MCA at the M1 segment, blocking all cortical MCA branches,
and sensory stimulation prevented for ~5 hr following occlusion, the result is a cortical infarct of 28.4±2.4 mm

Discussion
This protocol was developed in order to induce ischemia within the rodent cortex, and to do so with minimal peripheral impact to experimental
subjects. The double occlusion and transection method allows for visual confirmation that the vessel has been permanently occluded, and
may be performed without excessive invasion or tissue damage, and with a high survival rate. This occlusion protocol may be applied to any
cortical vessel that can be accessed via craniotomy in order to induce ischemia within a specific cortical domain. Furthermore, such occlusions
can be performed while an animal is in a stereotaxic apparatus allowing the simultaneous use of various investigational techniques, such as
functional imaging or electrophysiological recording. This makes this occlusion technique applicable to a wide range of experimental designs,
including within-subject investigation. For example, assessment may be carried out at baseline with sutures in place around the artery (but prior
to securing the sutures and transecting), during ischemic onset, and at any post-occlusion time point required.
Successful execution of this occlusion is contingent upon two critical steps. First, proper visualization of the target vessel is critical to inducing
ischemia. Occlusion at a location proximal to or distal to the desired location (in our typical case, just proximal to the primary anterior/ posterior
corticalbifurcationofMCA)canresultinalargedegreeofinfarctvolumevariability,socareshouldbetakentoconfirmthepropersiteof
occlusionandtransection.Second,passingthesutureneedlearoundthetargetarteryrequirescarefulandprecisetechnique.Bynecessity,
thesuturewillpassthroughthemostsuperficiallayerofthecorteximmediatelybelowtheartery.Careshouldbetakentoavoiddivingtoodeep
within the cortical surface, because this can result in vessel rupture, hemorrhage, or damage to the brain at the occlusion site. While many types
of blood vessel occlusion surgical tools are available, our lab has had the most success using half curve suture needles, truncated according to
experimenter preference. Used in conjunction with ultra-fine forceps, this tool allows the user to pass suture thread below an artery and above
the cortical surface with only minimal tissue damage.
Upon successful completion of an occlusion, infarct is limited to the cortex alone (Figure 2). In the context of using this occlusion method to
model MCA stroke, this may have important implication for researchers given that many MCA stroke patients sustain infarct within both the
cortexandbasalganglia.However,ourlaboratoryfavorsthisocclusionmethodasappliedtoMCAovertechniquessuchasintraluminalsuture
given the recent findings that impaired mastication, swallowing function, and impaired motor performance occur in 47% of all subjects that
undergo intraluminal suture 
35
; impaired cerebral perfusion and reduced spontaneous motor activity resulting from reduced food and water
uptake also contribute to poorer neurological recovery in rats following intraluminal suture 
36-40
.Truemanet al. 2011 have also reported abnormal
eating,impaireddrinkingbehavior,andsensorimotordisability(asquantifiedbytheadhesiveremovaltask)followingthisprocedure
11
.Critically,
we observed the same behavioral deficits in sham intraluminal suture animals 
11
. As a result, intraluminal suture may add serious confounding
factors to preclinical stroke study- many of which are directly attributable to the surgical procedure and not to cerebral ischemic stroke.
It is impossible to model the variable etiology and pathology of human ischemic stroke - in fact such a high degree of variability would be
undesirable in an experimental model. Stroke research in animals should instead focus on producing a result more analogous to human stroke
damageanddeficitswhileattemptingtomodeletiologyasbestpossible.Wesuggestthattheminimallyinvasivenature,occlusionofMCA
resulting in ischemia, infarct volume that is comparable to human MCA ischemia, and ability to incorporate multiple investigational techniques
