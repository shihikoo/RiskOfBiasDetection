Multifunctional probes with high MRI sensitivity and high efficiency for cell labeling are desirable for
MR cell imaging. Herein, we have fabricated fluorescent mesoporous silica-coated superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles (fmSiO
4
@SPIONs) for neural progenitor cell (C17.2) MR imaging.
FmSiO
4
@SPIONs were discrete and uniform in size, and had a clear core–shell structure. The magnetic
core size was about 10 nm and the fluorescent mesoporous silica coating layer was around 20 nm.
Compared with fluorescent dense silica-coated SPIONs (fdSiO
4
@SPIONs) with a similar size,
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs demonstrated higher MR sensitivity and cell labeling efficiency. When implanted into
the right hemisphere of stroke mice, contralateral to the ischemic territory, a small amount of labeled
cells were able to be tracked migrating to the lesion sites using a clinical MRI scanner (3 T). More
impressively, even when administered intravenously, the labeled cells could also be monitored homing
to the ischemic area. MRI observations were corroborated by histological studies of the brain tissues.
Our study demonstrated that fmSiO
4
@SPIONs are highly effective for cell imaging and hold great
promise for MRI cell tracking in future.
Introduction
Therapeutic strategies based on transplanted stem cells and
other progenitor cells hold strong promise for the treatment of
diseases by implementing tissue regeneration and repair.1,2
However, one of the crucial points in this approach is to provide
long-term and noninvasive imaging of transplanted stem cells
in the host organ and to track their migration and distribution
in vivo.3 Due to its high spatial resolution in three dimensions
and good so-tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is very promising to achieve this purpose.4,5 However,
compared with other imaging modalities, such as positron
emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging, the sensitivity
of MRI is relatively low.6 To track stem cells by MRI, the cells
must be labeled magnetically.7–9 In this context, commercially
available superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)
coated with dextran or its derivatives, in combination with
transfection agents, have been extensively explored for cell
labeling.10,11 However, cellular tracking using these nanoparticles
suffers from low intracellular labeling efficiency, as
manifested by the requirement of a long-term incubation or a
high concentration of particles with cells.12,13
To improve the labeling efficiency, HIV tat peptide or
monoclonal antibody has been conjugated to SPIONs to
increase nonphagocytic ingestion and thus enhance the MRI
detection sensitivity.14 Although these biomolecules efficiently
transport SPIONs into cells, the key issue regarding the
biosafety of a xenogeneic protein should be seriously considered.
Alternatively, SPION clusters or SPION-imbedded macrosized
polymer spheres with a high iron content have been
explored for cell imaging.7,15–19 Especially, for SPION macrospheres
, when incubated with cells, the intracellular payload of
100–300 picogram iron could be readily achieved. As a result,
single-cell or single-particle detection has been realized both
in vitro and in vivo.20–22 However, a recent study indicated that
high intracellular iron concentration would diminish cell
proliferation, disrupt the microtubule network and alter the
focal adhesion kinase signaling,13 which raised considerable
concerns about the long-term safety of the contrast agents.
Therefore, developing SPION contrast agents with a novel
conguration, which improves the MRI sensitivity and efficiency
for cell labeling, while containing lower iron content, is
highly desired for cell imaging.

Silica has been recognized as a good coating material for
SPIONs for bifunctional or multifunctional cellular labeling
because it is quite biocompatible and resistant to biodegradation
in cellular environments.23–25 Moreover, silica can be
easily fabricated into different congurations, such as nanowires
,26 nanorattle27 and nanocoating layer with a mesoporous
or dense structure,28,29 which could impart the coated materials
with unique properties. We and other groups have
observed that mesoporous silica coating could enhance MR
sensitivity of the magnetic nanoparticles dramatically.30,31
Moreover, MR sensitivity was tunable with the variation of
pore size.30 In addition, Liu et al. have demonstrated that
tumbler-like mesoporous silica nanoparticles attached by
silica-coated SPIONs could be used for stem cell labeling efficiently.32 Based on these ndings, we hypothesized that mesoporous
silica coating may improve both MRI sensitivity of
SPIONs and stem cell labeling efficiency. Mesoporous silicacoated
SPIONs may represent a new generation of cell imaging
contrast agents. Therefore, in the current study, we have
developed uorescent mesoporous silica-coated SPIONs
(fmSiO
4
@SPIONs) and investigated whether this novel contrast
agent could be used for neural progenitor cell (C17.2) labeling
efficiently and tracking to home to the brain ischemic site of
stroke mice with a clinical MRI analyzer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
The fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were fabricated by template growth of
silica on the SPION surface. SPIONs with a mean diameter of
10 nm were synthesized by a co-precipitation method and
stabilized with oleic acid.33 The mesoporous silica shells were
subsequently coated with a silica sol–gel reaction of tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) in an aqueous solution containing cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) and SPIONs under basic
conditions.31,34 CTAB was used not only as the stabilizing agent
to transfer hydrophobic SPIONs to the aqueous phase but also
as the organic structure-directing template to establish mesopores
on the silica shell. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) revealed that fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were discrete and
uniform in size with a clear core–shell structure (Fig. 1a). The
average size of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs was about 50 nm with a 20 nm
mesoporous silica coating layer. The porous nature of
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs was tested by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms, which exhibited an IV-type curve, thus demonstrating
their mesoporous structure (Fig. 2a). The pore size
distribution calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
model35showed that the mean value of the pore size was 2.8 nm
with narrow size distribution (Fig. 2a, inset), which demonstrated
that fmSiO
4
@SPIONs had uniform porosity. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area36 and total pore
volume of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were calculated to be 698.32 m2g1
and 1.64 cm3 g1, respectively. MR relaxometry of the
fmSiO

@SPION water suspension was performed using a 1.41 T
Minispec mq60 NMR Analyzer (Bruker, Germany). T

(r

than that of the conventional iron oxide contrast agents (usually
less than 200 s1 mM1).37 In order to investigate the effect of
surface coating on T
2
relaxivity, we also synthesizeduorescent
dense silica-coated SPIONs (fdSiO
4
@SPIONs) with the same
SPION core and a similar thickness of the coating layer (Fig. 1b).
T
2
relaxivities for fdSiO
4
@SPIONs and the uncoated SPIONs
were 231.74 and 142.48 mM1 s1, respectively, much lower
than those of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs. Therefore, we believe that the
improvement inT
2
relaxivity is due to mesoporous silica surface
coating. Mesoporous silica coating slows diffusion of water
molecules conned in mesopores. Moreover, hydrogen bonding
between water and mesoporous silica walls also restricts the
mobility of water molecules. Considering the large surface area,
hydrogen bonding would result in a large amount of immobilized
water in the mesopores. The restriction of water mobility
in the mesopores would lead to a longer time that water molecules
experience the local magnetic eld generated by SPIONs,
and thus more efficient dephasing (relaxation) of water protons.
The hydrodynamic sizes of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs and fdSiO
4
@
SPIONs determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were
151 2 nm and 148 5 nm, respectively, and did not change
signicantly for a long period of time (Fig. 2c). The zeta
potential of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs in water (pH 7.0) was 22.5 mV
and that for fdSiO
4
@SPIONs was38.0 mV.
Neural progenitor cell (C17.2) labeling
Neural progenitor cells (C17.2) were derived from the cerebellum
of a neonatal mouse and immortalized at postnatal day
4 using a v-myc immortalizing oncogene.38,39 For cell labeling,
C17.2 cells were incubated with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs or fdSiO
4
@
SPIONs at various concentrations (in iron) in culture media
(5mgmL 1,10mgmL 1,20mgmL 1, and 33mgmL 1)at37C
for 2 h or at the concentration of 10 mg mL 1 for different
periods of time (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h). Fig. 3 shows Prussian blue
staining of cells aer labeling, which indicates that cell uptake
of the nanoparticles was dose- and time-dependent. By visual
inspection, cell ingestion of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs was more than
that of fdSiO
4
@SPIONs (Fig. 3a and b). T
2
-weighted MR
imaging of cells demonstrated that cells labeled with
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs showed a more pronounced hypointense
signal than those cells labeled with fdSiO
4
@SPIONs (Fig. 4a).
In line with the above observation, inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) quantication of
intracellular iron indicated that cell uptake of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
was indeed more efficient than that of fdSiO
4
@SPIONs under
each incubation condition, which is shown in Fig. 4b.
Considering the similar size of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs and
fdSiO
4
@SPIONs, our data indicated that mesoporous silica
coating facilitated cell uptake of SPIONs and improved cell
labeling efficiency. The higher cell labeling efficiency of
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs may arise from its mesoporous surface
structure. Huang et al. have demonstrated that mesoporous
silica nanoparticles were highly efficient for stem cell
labeling.40 Liu et al. have observed that human mesenchymal
stem cell (hMSC) uptake of silica-coated SPIONs was signi-
cantly improved aer the particles were combined with mesoporous
silica nanoparticles.32 In addition, surface charge also
affects cell-uptake efficiency of mesoporous nanoparticles.41
The cell membrane is negatively charged.42 The less negative
surface charge of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs (zeta potential, 22.5 mV)
than that of fdSiO
4
@SPIONs (zeta potential, 38.0 mV) may
contribute partially to the higher cell uptake efficiency of
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs. SHU555A (Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin,
Germany), a commercially available contrast agent, is oen
used for cell imaging.8,43 To further demonstrate the high
efficiency of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs for cell labeling, cell labeling
with SHU555A was also performed as a comparison. Similar to
the above nding, cell internalization of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
was much more pronounced than that of SHU555A (ESI Fig. S1
and S2†).

Cellular internalization of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
For in vivo MR imaging of SPION-labeled cells, the close association
of the particles with the cells is of crucial importance
and internalized particles are generally favored over surfaceassociated
ones. In this context, internalization of fmSiO
4
@
SPIONs by C17.2 cells was analyzed using a confocal laser
scanning microscope by means of sequential imaging along the
z axis at 0.2 mm interslice distances. Fig. 5 shows a representative
cell image from the middle slice of the cell. The bright-eld
image (Fig. 5a) and the merged image (Fig. 5e) show the details
of cell morphology, position of the intact membrane and
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs (green), which indicated that fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
entered the cytosol and accumulated inside distinct vesicles.
Orthogonal projections of z-stack reconstructions (Fig. 5f) also
manifested the relative position of particles compared to the
cell body, suggesting that, at this point, fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were
internalized by C17.2 cell rather than being associated with the
cell surface.
Biocompatibility of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
For biocompatibility study, we rst investigated the viability of
cells aer treating them with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs by CCK-8 assay
(Fig. 6a) and trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 6b). To this end,
C17.2 cells were incubated with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs or SHU555A (a
commercially available iron oxide contrast agent, used as a
comparison) at the iron concentration of 10 mg mL 1 for
different periods of time. The assays revealed that cell viability
was not hindered by the presence of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs for a
short-term. No direct cytotoxic effects could be noted aer 3 h of
incubation, reaching (98.43  9.46)% and (95.86  2.64)%
viability analyzed by CCK-8 and trypan blue assays, respectively.
However, aer incubation for 5 h, the viability of cells decreased
marginally ((92.5210.26)% for trypan blue assay and (87.62
13.84)% for CCK-8 assay) and prominently aer 24 h incubation
((87.6213.84)% for trypan blue assay and (76.623.26)% for
CCK-8 assay). Nevertheless, these data were comparable to
those for the cells treated with SHU555A. The cytotoxic effect of
both fmSiO
4
@SPIONs and SHU555A aer a long-term incubation
may arise from high intracellular iron internalized by
cells.44 Regarding the cytotoxicity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs), a vast number of studies have been performed.
Although quite different conclusions have been drawn
depending on the type of MSNs, it is believed that the porosity,

particle size, and postsynthetic treatment procedure (calcination
/solvent extraction) may affect their cytotoxicity.45 In our
case, these factors may also inuence cell viability, but as evidenced
by SHU555A, the inuence of the mesoporous silica
coating layer is marginal.
C17.2 is an immortalized neural progenitor cell line and
keeps active proliferation capacity.38 Next, we examined if
fmSiO

@SPION labeling under non-cytotoxic condition (i.e.
10mgmL1for 2 h) affected cell proliferation. For this purpose,
the cells were stained against Ki 67 antigen that is highly
expressed in proliferating cell nuclei during cell mitosis,46 and
cell-cycle progression was assessed and veried by manual cell
counting. Compared with the control (unlabeled cells, Ki 67
positive: 56.7%), no reduction in cell proliferation aer
fmSiO

(Fig. 7). The cell doubling time calculated for the unlabeled

with a previous report,13 and that for fmSiO

results indicated that fmSiO

Nestin is widely considered as a specic marker for neural stem
cells and neural progenitors.47,48C17.2 is a neural progenitor cell
line, and as indicated in ESI Fig. S3† C17.2 cells highly express
nestin.49 When transplanted into normal or lesioned (necrosis)
brains, majority of C17.2 cells remained undifferentiated.50 In
order to identify the MRI signal decrease in lesion sites arising
fromthemigratedC17.2cells,immunouorescentstainingofan

uorescent imaging of nestin positive C17.2 cells and
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs co-registered the fmSiO
4
@SPION-labeled cells
at the injection site (Fig. 8c–f) and near the boundary of the
ischemic area (Fig. 8g–j). These observations suggested that the
transplanted C17.2 cells migrated from theinjection site, homed
to the ischemic area and thus reduced the MR signal intensity,
which was pretty similar to that of mesenchymal stem cells
infused in the same manner.17

cells could migrate to the ischemic brain and preferentially
localize to the lesion site, and the migrated cells or cell clusters
were mainly detected nearby the lesion boundary.
For cell therapy of ischemic brain, various cell delivery
routes, such as introducing cells intravenously,52 intra-arterially
,53 intraventricularly and intracerebrally,54 have been adopted.
Among them, intravenous injection is a minimally invasive
and clinically relevant technique. However, in agreement with
the previousndings,53 a biodistribution study indicated that a
large proportion of labeled cells were retained in the liver,
spleen, lung and kidney (Fig. 10). Only a small part of labeled
cells graed the target brain. Although we did not know the
exact amount of cells graed, our results proved that
fmSiO
4
@SPION labeling was sensitive enough to allow for
monitoring of the migration of a small number of cells in the
mouse brain, much less than tens of million cells needed for
stem cell therapy.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated uorescent mesoporous
silica-coated SPIONs (fmSiO
4
@SPIONs), which were
discrete and uniform in size and had high MRI sensitivity.
When used for neural progenitor cell labeling, fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
demonstrated improved cell labeling efficiency. Even more,
aer infused intracerebrally into stroke mice contralateral to
ischemic hemisphere or injected intravenously, a small amount
of the labeled cells could be tracked homing to the ischemic
area with a clinical MRI scanner (3 T). Histological studies
conrmed the presence of labeled cells in the lesion sites, which
are mainly distributed in the boundary. Taken together, our
study demonstrated that fmSiO
4
@SPIONs, a new kind of cell
imaging contrast agent, were robust for cell imaging and hold
great promise for MRI cell tracking in future.

synthesized by a conventional co-precipitation method in an
aqueous phase and stabilized with oleic acid.33 Then, the
magnetic nanoparticles were transferred to an aqueous phase

was performed by assembly of the surfactant template CTAB and
silica precursor TEOS in basic solution. FITC dye was covalently
incorporated into the mesoporous silica framework during the
mesoporous silica coating process. Finally, the template was
removed to generate mesopores by extraction of the surfactant
using acetone as solution. Fluorescent dense silica-coated
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (fdSiO
4
@SPIONs)
were synthesized according to a previously published procedure
with little modication.56 In brief, fdSiO
4
@SPIONs were synthesized
by dissolving 5 mg oleic acid-capped SPIONs into 40 mL
cyclohexane containing 2 mL Igepal CO-520 and subsequent
hydrolization of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and FITC–APTES
in the mixture in the presence of ammonia solution. For characterizations
of the particles, the morphology, size, and size
distribution were characterized using a transmission electron
microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F, Japan) at an acceleration voltage
of 200 kV. The particle size and size distribution were calculated
using an image analysis program by measuring the diameter of
no less than 300 particles. The zeta potentials were measured in
water using a Zeta2000 Potential Analyzer (Malvern, UK). The
hydrodynamic diameters were determined using a dynamic light
scattering using a spectrometer (Autosizer 4700/PCS100, Malvern
, UK) equipped with an Ar ion laser operating at 488 nm. MR
relaxometry of the magnetic particles was performed using a 1.41
T minispec mq60 NMR Analyzer (Bruker, Germany) and T
2
relaxivity was deduced from inverse T
2
as a function of iron
concentrations. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured at
77 K with a Micromeritcs ASAP2010 analyzer (USA). The specic
surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method36 in a linear relative pressure range between 0.05
and 0.25. The pore size distributions were derived from the
desorption branches of the isotherms by the NLDFT57 and BJH
methods35using the Quantachrome Autosorb 1 soware (Quantachrome
Instruments, USA).
Cell culture
The C17.2 cells were purchased from CellBank Australia and
maintained in Dulbecco's modied Eagle's medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum,
2 mM glutamine, penicillin–streptomycin, 1.2 mM sodium pyruvate
and 1.8 g L1sodium bicarbonate in uncoated tissue culture
dishes at a density of 5–7 103cm2in standard humidied 5%
CO
2
at 37 C. The cells were split when grown to 90% conuence.
Cell labelling
For cell labelling, C17.2 cells were incubated with the
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs, fdSiO
4
@SPIONs or SHU555A (Bayer Schering
Pharma, Berlin, Germany) at various concentrations (in iron) in
culture media (5 mgmL 1,10mgmL 1,20mgmL 1, and 33 mg
mL1)at37C for 2 h or at the concentration of 10mg Fe per mL
for different periods of time (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h). Aer incubation,
the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH ¼ 7.4), trypsinized, and counted for the
following experiments.
Prussian blue staining of the labeled cells
For Prussian blue staining, the cells were seeded on cover glass
slices. Aer incubation with nanoparticles, the cells were
washed three times with PBS (pH ¼ 7.4) and xed with paraformaldehyde
(4%) for 10 minutes. Thexed cells were stained
with 10 wt% Prussian blue (K

Fe(CN)
6
$3H
2
O) for 5 min and the
mixture of 10 wt% Prussian blue and 20% HCl (1 : 1) for 30 min
successively. Aer washing with water, the cells were counterstained
with nuclear fast red for 5 min. The stained cells were
dehydrated with gradient ethanol (70%, 95%, and 100%),
cleared with xylene and adhered onto glass slides for microscopic
study.
MR cell imaging
For MR imaging, the labeled cells (1 105) were suspended in
gelatin (2%, 500mL) in plastic vials homogenously and placed in
a water tank. MRI was performed with a 3 T MRI scanner (Signa
EXITE, GE Healthcare) using a clinical head coil with a
T
2
-weighted spin echo sequence (TR ¼ 2000 ms, TE ¼ 37 ms,
FOV¼ 220 220 mm, and slice thickness¼ 2 mm).
ICP-AES quantication of intracellular iron
To determine the intracellular iron, inductively coupled plasma
atom emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (ICAP-6300, Thermo
Fisher, USA) measurements of the labelled cells were performed.
Before measurement, the cells were digested with aqua
regia and diluted to 10 mL with de-ionized water. Triplet
experiments were performed, and the average value of the
intracellular iron content was taken and expressed as mean
SD in picograms of iron per cell.
Biocompatibility of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
To test the biocompatibility of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs, cell viability
and proliferation capacity aer labeling were examined. The
viability of the labeled cells was evaluated by trypan blue
exclusion assay and using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan)58,59 according to the manufacture's procedures.
For this purpose, cells were incubated with fmSiO
4
@
SPIONs at the iron concentration of 10 mgmL 1 for different
periods of time (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 24 h). For trypan blue
exclusion assay, aer incubation, the cells were washed three
times with PBS, trypsinized, centrifuged, andnally suspended
in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were mixed with 0.4% of trypan
blue dye at an 1 : 1 (v/v) ratio and the mixture was loaded into a
Neubauer chamber for cell counting. Cells with an intact
membrane excluded the dye and were considered as live cells.
The percentage of live cells was determined. For CCK-8 assay,

the cells (1  104) were seeded in a 96 multi-well plate. Aer
incubation, the culture medium was removed, and the cells
were washed with PBS three times. Subsequently, fresh cell
culture medium (90 mL) was added to each well, followed by
addition of 10 mL CCK-8 solution. Then, the cells were incubated
for 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using a
Wallace 1420 multilabel counter VICTOR3 (PerkinElmer, Baltimore
, MD). Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of the
absorbance of cells incubated with the nanoparticles to that of
the cells maintained in normal culture medium. The cell
viability aer labeling with SHU555A was also evaluated as a
comparison.
To evaluate the cell proliferation capacity, immunocytostaining
against cell nuclear Ki 67 antigen was performed. Aer
being treated with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs at the iron concentration of
10 mg mL 1 for 2 hours, cells were xed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 minutes and then washed three times with
PBS (pH ¼ 7.4). Subsequently, the cells were pre-incubated in
5% goat serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS at room
temperature successively. For immunostaining, the cells were
incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-Ki67 antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in combination with secondary Cy3
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Cell nuclei
were counter-stained with DAPI during nal incubation with
secondary antibodies. In vitro cell counting was performed on
20 randomly chosenelds, counting both total cell number and
cells positive for Ki 67. Each well was evaluated separately and at
least eight wells per staining were counted.
Cell doubling time was estimated by the manual counting
method. To this end, C17.2 cells were seeded at 1106cells per
culture ask and labeled with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs at the iron
concentration of 10 mg mL 1 for 2 h. Aer labeling, the cells
were kept in culture and were re-seeded at 1  106 cells per
cultureask every 48 h. The average cell division time for three
independent tests was given.
Cellular internalization of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
To demonstrate whether fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were internalized by
the cells, confocal microscopy studies of the labeled cells were
performed. For this purpose, C17.2 cells were grown on cover
slides and incubated with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs at the concentration
of 10 mg Fe per mL for 2 h. Aer being xed with 4% paraformaldehyde
, the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Then, the
labeled cells were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system
(Leica, Mannheim, Germany) with Leica AFS Lite 2.3.0 imaging
processing soware under an oil-immersion 40 objective. For
localization of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs intracellularly, horizontal
z-stacks were obtained by capturing images with a 0.2 mm
interslice distance along the z-axis.
Mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
The animal study was approved by the animal protection and
care committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. For preparation
of the MCAO mouse model, female CD-1 mice (4 week old,
Slaccas Company, Shanghai, China) were used and the procedure
has been described previously.60 Briey, the mice were
anesthetized and the le common carotid artery was exposed.
The internal carotid artery (ICA) was then isolated and its
branch, the pterygopalatine artery, was ligated close to its
origin. Then a 6-0 rounded tip nylon suture was advanced from
the external carotid artery (ECA) up to the internal carotid artery
for a distance of 10.0  0.5 mm. MCAO induced mouse le
brain damage was identied and monitored by MR imaging (3 T
MRI scanner, Signa EXITE, GE Healthcare) using a surface coil
with aT
2
-weighted fast spin echo sequence (TR¼5840 ms, TE¼
104 ms, FOV ¼ 45 mm  45 mm, matrix ¼ 256  256, slice
thickness¼ 1.5 mm, and 4 collections).
MR tracking of the labeled cells in MCAO mice
For MR tracking, C17.2 cells were labeled with fmSiO
4
@SPIONs
at the concentration of 10 mg Fe per mL for 2 hours. The cells
were injected intracerebrally into the mouse right hemisphere
or intravenouslyviatail vein one day aer MCAO. For each case,
mice were divided into three groups with ve mice in each
group. One group was injected with fmSiO
4
@SPION-labeled
cells, one group with an equal dose (in iron) of plain
fmSiO
4
@SPIONs and another group with an equal amount of
non-labeled cells. For intracerebral injection, the labeled cells,
plain cells or fmSiO
4
@SPIONs were stereotaxically injected into
the brain using a micro-pump with a 36-gauge needle. The
transplantation site was targeted at the following coordinates of
the right intact hemisphere, contralateral to the ischemic
territory: 1.0 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to the
midline, 3.0 mm ventral to the dura. The injection rate was
0.4 mL min1 and a total of 5 mL fmSiO
4
@SPION-labeled cells
(5105) were infused. For intravenous injection, the labeled or
plain C17.2 cells (1  106 cells in 300 mL PBS) were injected
through tail vein. The infused fmSiO
4
@SPION-labeled cells
were tracked with a 3 T MRI scanner (Sigma EXITE, GE
Healthcare). T
2
-weighted MR imaging was performed one day
and three days aer cell implantation using a surface coil with a
T
2
-weighted fast spin echo sequence (TR¼ 5840 ms, TE¼ 104
ms, FOV¼ 45 mm 45 mm, matrix¼ 256 256, slice thickness ¼ 1.5 mm, and 4 collections). T

relaxation times of
ischemic sites before and aer fmSiO

range¼20–160 ms, 8 echoes, FOV¼45 mm45 mm, matrix¼
256 256, and slice thickness¼ 2 mm).
Immunohistological studies of MCAO mouse brain
C17.2 is a murine immortalized neural progenitor cell line and
has an immature phenotype, which is nestin positive.49 Aer
MR imaging, the mice were sacriced and their brains were
surgically removed. To identify fmSiO
4
@SPION-labeled cells
migrating to the ischemic site aer intracerebral or intravenous
injection, immunohistological staining of mouse brain against
nestin was performed. For this purpose, the mouse brain was
embedded in OCT (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen on dry ice and
sectioned into twenty micrometer thick slices using a cryostat
(CM 1900 UV, Leica, Germany). Next, the slices were xed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed three times with

PBS (pH¼7.4) and blocked for 1 h with 5% goat serum (in PBS).
Finally, the tissue slices were incubated with a primary goat
anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon, CA) overnight at 4 C and an
Alexa Fluor-coupled anti-goat IgG (Chemicon, CA) for 2 h at
room temperature successively. The nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
Jiangsu, China). Plain C17.2 cells were also stained with the
same procedure as a positive control.
Biodistribution of labeled cells post-intravenous injection
To determine the biodistribution of the labeled cells, organ
samples (kidney, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, stomach, lungs,
blood, right hemisphere and le hemisphere) were collected,
weighed and digested with nitric acid in a microwave digestion
system (EXCEL, Preekem Scientic Instruments Co. Ltd,
Shanghai, China). The solution was diluted with Milli-Q water
and the silica content was quantied with an inductively
coupled plasma atom emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, ICAP-
6300, Thermo Fisher, USA). The percentage of injected dose per
gram tissue (% ID g1) of fmSiO
4
@SPIONs in a specic tissue
was calculated.
