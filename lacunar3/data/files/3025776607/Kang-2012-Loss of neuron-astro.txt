Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a potent neural cytokine with very low expression in the CNS, predominantly by astrocytes. CNTF
increases rapidly and greatly following traumatic or ischemic injury. Understanding the underlying mechanisms would help to design
pharmacological treatments to increase endogenous CNTF levels for neuroprotection. Here, we show that astroglial CNTF expression in
the adult mouse striatum is increased twofold within 1 h and increases up to30-fold over 2 weeks following a focal stroke caused by a
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Selective neuronal loss caused by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid resulted in
a comparable increase. Cocultured neurons reduced CNTF expression in astrocytes, which was prevented by light trypsinization. RGD
(arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) blocking peptides induced CNTF expression, which was dependent on transcription. Astroglial CNTF
expression was not affected by diffusible neuronal molecules or by neurotransmitters. The transient ischemia does not seem to directly
increaseCNTF,asintrastriatalinjectionofanischemicsolutionorexposureofnaivemiceorculturedcellstoseverehypoxiahadminimal

in naive mice had no or small effects, and anti-inflammatory treatments did not diminish the increase in CNTF after MCAO.CNTF/
mice had more extensive tissue loss and similar astrocyte activation after MCAO than their wild-type littermates. These data suggest that

Introduction
Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) can rescue various types of
adult CNS neurons in disease models, including striatal (Anderson
et al., 1996; Emerich et al., 1997; Zala et al., 2004), cholinergic
forebrain (Hagg et al., 1992), dopaminergic midbrain (Hagg and
Varon, 1993), and motor neurons (Mitsumoto et al., 1994; Sagot
et al., 1995; Pun et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2010). CNTF is also a
trophic factor for oligodendrocytes and has protective effects in a
multiple sclerosis model (Louis et al., 1993; Linker et al., 2002).
Intraocular CNTF is being developed as a treatment for retinal
degeneration (Sieving et al., 2006; Emerich and Thanos, 2008).
However, delivery of CNTF to the CNS is hampered by limited
diffusion across the blood–brain barrier and serious systemic
side effects, which caused the failure of clinical trials for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (Thoenen and Sendtner, 2002). CNTF is
almost exclusively produced in the nervous system, and in the
CNS expression is very low compared to that in the peripheral
nerves and is produced mainly by astrocytes (Ip, 1998; Stockli et
al., 1989; Park et al., 2000). It follows that pharmacological agents
that enter the CNS and stimulate endogenous CNTF production
might be neuroprotective. We found that a D
2
dopamine agonist,
which reduces cAMP, increases CNTF levels twofold in mice and
in cultured astrocytes (Yang et al., 2008). However, D
2
receptors
are not sufficiently widespread to warrant developing D
2
-based
CNTF inducers. A more general mechanism may be found in the
response to traumatic brain injury (Ip et al., 1993a; Asada et al.,
1995), lens injury (Leibinger et al., 2009), or focal ischemic stroke
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Hu et al., 1997; Lin
et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000), after which both mRNA levels and
protein show rapid and dramatic increases in astrocytes.
The increase in CNTF seen in the striatum of rats after MCAO
(Lin et al., 1998) could theoretically involve several mechanisms,
including ischemia, reperfusion injury, inflammation, and neuronal
degeneration. Proinflammatory cytokines IL6 (Wang et al.,
1995; Clark et al., 1999) and IFN (de Bilbao et al., 2009) are
increased shortly after MCAO in rats, and IFN can stimulate
CNTF expression in cultured astrocytes (Carroll et al., 1993).
Neuronal dysfunction as a CNTF inducer following MCAO is
also a possibility, as high CNTF expression in astrocytes is suppressed
by coculturing with neurons (Rudge et al., 1994). Conversely
, the normal in vivo environment of the astrocytes may
suppress CNTF to very low levels. If so, neuron–astrocyte interactions
could consist of direct cell-to-cell contact or by release of
molecules such as neurotransmitters. Identification of the fundamental
mechanisms that regulate CNTF would be important for

rational drug development to treat neurological disorders and
would be helpful for investigating CNTF’s role in physiological
and pathophysiological processes in the CNS.
Here, we investigate the contributions of neuronal interactions
, ischemia, and inflammation in the increases in striatal
CNTF expression in a mouse MCAO model. We also investigate
the potential role of this increase by applying MCAO to CNTF
null mice and their littermates.
Materials and Methods
Animals. A total of 99 male C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks of age; 24–28 g;
The Jackson Laboratory) were used for most of the in vivo studies. FVB
(Friend virus B) mice (16 male mice; Jackson Laboratory) were used to
compare the effects of quinolinic acid injections, to which these mice are
more sensitive than C57BL/6 mice, and stroke. Eight CNTF knock-out
mice [VG#199 in the study by Valenzuela et al. (2003)] and their wildtype
littermates were used to determine the potential functions of CNTF
following MCAO. Tail snips were collected, and genotyping was performed
with the Velocigene protocol provided by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
, who produced the mice. These mice came on a C57BL/6
129Sv background and were backcrossed to C57BL/6 five times. In addition
, postnatal day 0 (P0)–P1 C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were
used to obtain cells for tissue culture experiments. Anesthesia was
achieved by an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (0.4 mg 2,2,2-
tribromoethanol in 0.02 ml of 1.25% 2-methyl-2-butanol in saline per
gram body weight; Sigma-Aldrich). To reduce pain after surgeries, the
mice were injected subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.1 ml of a 1:20
dilution of 0.3 mg/ml stock solution in saline; Ben Venue Laboratories)
once they recovered from anesthesia to prevent fatal interaction with
Avertin. Injections were given every 12 h for a total of four injections. To
reduce infections, gentamicin was given subcutaneously during surgery,
as well as at 2 and 4 d after surgery (0.1 ml of a 1:200 dilution of a 40
mg/ml stock solution in saline; ButlerSchein). All experiments involving
living animals were performed according to University of Louisville Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee protocols and NIH
guidelines.
MCAO focal ischemia model. A unilateral focal ischemic lesion of the
striatum and overlying cortex was achieved by a 15 min MCAO. After a
midline skin incision in the anterior neck area, the left external carotid
artery was exposed and ligated with 5-0 silk suture after small artery
branches cauterized (electrocautery; N.S. 237; Codman and Shurtleff).
The right common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery were
temporarily occluded by microvascular clips, and a small hole was made
in the external carotid artery. A 0.21-mm-diameter nylon suture
(6021PK5Re; Doccol) was inserted through the hole and advanced to the
origin of the middle cerebral artery, approximately over an 8–9 mm
distance. Cerebral blood flow decreased immediately to20% of baseline
as measured by a needle probe of laser-Doppler flowmetry (Moor
VMS-LDF, VP10M200ST, P10d; Moor Instruments) glued directly on
the superior portion of the temporal bone. After 15 min, the Doccol
suture was withdrawn and the clips removed from the carotid to restore
blood flow to the occluded territory. Sham-operated mice received the
same surgery except the filament was not inserted. Afterward, the wound
wasclosedinlayers.Bodytemperaturewasmaintainedat37.00.5°Cby
placing each mouse on a heating pad during surgery and the recovery
period. At various times between 1 h and 14 d, the mice were processed to
collect striatal tissue. To test whether inflammation might regulate CNTF
expression, some groups of mice received anti-inflammatory drugs injected
intraperitoneally daily, starting 1 d after MCAO, to circumvent
their potential neuroprotective actions, until 7 d after injury. The daily
doses were 50 mg/kg for minocycline (Weng and Kriz, 2007), 5 mg/kg for
indomethacine (Veltkamp et al., 2002), and 50 mg/kg for ketoprofen
(Pinardi et al., 2003).
In a separate experiment, CNTF/ mice and their wild-type littermates
received a 30 min MCAO. These mice received intensive care by
daily replacement of lost weight with a subcutaneous injection of Ringer
’s lactate–dextrose solution. A hydration gel pack and peanut butter
cookies were placed on the bedding in addition to their water bottle and
chow. These mice were processed for histology after 14 d.
Intracerebral injections.To inject reagents into the striatum, the heads
of the mice were stabilized in a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus, using rat ear
bars and a mouse tooth bar set at 0 mm. A burr hole was drilled with a 1
mm drill bit attached to a Dremel drill at coordinates 1 mm rostrocaudal
and 1.5 mm lateral from Bregma using the tip of the needle of a 10l
Hamilton syringe clamped into an electrode holder of a Kopf stereotaxic
micromanipulator as the probe. Next, the needle was lowered to 3.5 mm
dorsoventral from the dura into the middle of the striatum. After waiting
2 min to ensure adhesion of brain tissue to the needle, which prevents
backflow, 1 l of the test reagent was injected over a 3 min period,
followed by another 2 min waiting period, again to prevent backflow.
Mice were injected with (1) vehicles specific to the various reagents; (2)
30 nmol quinolinic acid dissolved in saline to selectively kill the striatal
neurons, using FVB mice, which are much more sensitive to the striatal
excitotoxicity than C57BL/6 mice (Schauwecker, 2005); (3) 1g each of
the proinflammatory cytokines IFNor IL6 (Prospec), to test the potential
CNTF-regulating effects of inflammatory cytokines, or rhCNTF (a
gift from Scios Nova); or (4) ischemic solution (Yao et al., 2007) consisting
of a mixture of molecules and at an osmolarity and pH that mimic the
ischemic extracellular environment of the stroke tissue (except the low
oxygen content) to test whether metabolic components of stroke potentially
might contribute to early increased CNTF. Afterward, the needle
was withdrawn, any bleeding stopped, and the skin sutured closed. After
various times, from1hto1ddepending on the injected reagent, the mice
were processed to collect striatal tissues.
Whole-body hypoxia. To test the possibility that low oxygen might be
responsible for the stroke-induce increases in CNTF, naive C57BL/6
mice were exposed to hypoxia by stepwise decline from sublethal to lethal
dosage, comparing them with those age-matched mice housed in room
air. Mice experiencing 5% for lethal hypoxia can rarely survive for12
min (Zhang et al., 2004). In this study, five male adult mice were initially
kept under 7% O
2
for 15 min, followed by 6% O
2
for 5 min, and then
maintained at 5% O
2
for 10 min during the daylight in environmental
chambers (Oxycycler model A84XOV; BioSpherix). The nadir of the
ambient oxygen level in the chamber was continuously measured with an
oxygen sensor and periodically calibrated via another oxygen analyzer
placed at the cage bottom. Humidity (40–50%), ambient CO
2
(0.03%), and temperature (26°C) in the chambers were periodically
monitored and maintained during exposures. Mice were euthanized for
brain extraction in 2 h after exposure.
Tissue cultures.Cells were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere containing
5% CO
2
/95% air. Mouse astrocyte cultures were prepared as described
previously (Carroll et al., 1993) with some modifications. P0–P1
C57BL/6 mice were decapitated, and their brains were removed and
cortices isolated in ice-cold HBSS (Invitrogen). Cortices were dissociated
in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 15 min (Invitrogen) followed by washes in
culturing medium comprising DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 2
mML-glutamine, 100g/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Tissue
was triturated in culture medium and left for 5 min to allow undissociated
tissue to settle. The cell suspension was transferred to a fresh 50
ml tube then centrifuged before the cell pellet was resuspended in culturing
medium and plated on 10 cm dishes (Corning). The following day,
plates were agitated by hand and washed with PBS (Invitrogen) to remove
dead cells and neurons before being returned to fresh culturing
medium. Medium was replaced every 3 d thereafter. When cells were
90% confluent, cytosine arabinoside (10M, Sigma) was added to the
culture medium for 3 d to suppress fibroblast growth. Cultures were
maintained for an additional 6–7 d before cells were removed in trypsin
(0.25%)andplatedontopoly-D-lysine-coated(50g/ml;Sigma)six-well
plates or transwell membranes (0.4 m pore size; Corning) at 60,000
cells/ml and grown for an additional 5–6 d before experiments were
performed.
Primary mouse neuron cultures were prepared from P0–P1 C57BL/6
mice as follows. Cortices were isolated and trypsinized in 100 U papain

Sigma]. Neurons were plated onto 5–7 DIV astrocyte cultures or poly-D-
lysine-coated plates in Eagle’s basal medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (BCS; HyClone), 35 mM glucose, 1
mM L -glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100g/ml streptomycin.
After 4 h, the medium was gently removed and cells washed in HBSS
before being returned to a 0% serum medium [Basal Medium Eagle
supplemented with 10% Ham’s F-12 (Invitrogen), 1 N2 supplement,
35 mMglucose, 1 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100g/ml
streptomycin] to reduce proliferation of dividing cells. Transwell inserts
were washed in PBS before being placed on to neuron-enriched cultures
at 2–3 DIV, and RNA was isolated 24 h later. Neuron–astrocyte cocultures
were incubated with glutamate (20M), NMDA antagonist MK-
801 (50M), dopamine HCl (100M), acetylcholine (50M), and GABA
(100M), all purchased from Sigma, for 6 h before RNA was isolated. For
experiments involving trypsin, culturing medium was removed and
stocked before cells were washed in warm HBSS then incubated with
trypsin (0.005%) in HBSS for 10 min. Trypsin was aspirated and cultures
washed with warmed plating medium containing BCS (see above) before
being returned to stocked conditioned medium. Control cultures underwent
washing but were returned to stocked medium with no further
treatment. Cells were lysed after 6 h and RNA collected.
Cell lines.C6 astroglioma cells (ATCC) were maintained in t75 culture
flasks (USA Scientific) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 mM
L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from
Invitrogen). Cells were washed in PBS and then incubated in 0.05%
trypsin/HBSS. When cells were in suspension, a volume of culture medium
equal to that of trypsin/HBSS was added and gently mixed to
inactivate trypsin. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5
min and the supernatant aspirated. Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh
culture medium and counted with a hemocytometer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Hausser Scientific).
To determine whether integrins played a role in CNTF regulation, C6
cells were incubated for 24 h after plating at 160,000 cells/ml. Integrinblocking
peptides argenine-glycine-aspartate-serine [RGDS; 20 g/ml
(Panetti and McKeown-Longo, 1993; Droppelmann et al., 2009); catalog
#3498, Tocris Bioscience] or argenine-glycine-glutamate-serine [RGES;
20g/ml (Panetti and McKeown-Longo, 1993); catalog #A5686, Sigma]
were added to the culture medium. To test the role of transcription in
CNTF regulation, integrin peptide-treated C6 cells were pretreated with
the inhibitor of transcription actinomysin (0.3 g/ml; catalog #1229,
Tocris Bioscience) for 1 h before addition of peptides. Cells were maintained
with peptides for 4 h before RNA was isolated and CNTF expression
quantitated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).
Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed as described previously
(Ve ´ga et al., 2006) but was, briefly, performed as follows. C6 cells
were plated at 60,000 per milliliter and grown for 24 h before medium was
stocked and cells were washed in DMEM without glucose (Sigma) with
supplements (1 mML-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin
). Cultures were then incubated in a computer-driven hypoxia chamber
(Biospherix) with a sensor to measure the dissolved O
2
profile. OGD was
sustained for 2 or4hofa24hperiod before stocked medium was returned
andcellsallowedtorecoverfor22or20h,respectively.Cellswerelysed,RNA
extracted, and CNTF measured by RT-qPCR.
qPCR. RNA was isolated from cultured cells or from freshly dissected
striatum obtained from 1-mm-thick slices after euthanizing mice and
quickly dissecting out the brains. After mRNA was extracted by an
mRNA kit (74104; Qiagen), cDNA was made at 70°C for 5 min and 37°C
for 1 h with 1.0 l total RNA (1.0 g), 1.0 l of 500 ng/l random
primers (C118A; Promega), 1.25lof10m M dNTP mix (U151A; Promega
), 5 l 5  RT buffer, 1.75 l of RNase-free water, and 1 l of 
200U/l MMLV-RT (M170A; Promega). qPCR was performed at this
condition (10 min at 95° followed by 40 cycles of 95° for 15 s and 60° for
1 min) using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix kits (4369016; Applied
Biosystems) and specific primer sets (CNTF, mM00446373_m1 FAM;
GAPDH, 4352339E VIC; Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 7900 Thermal Cycler
(Applied Biosystems). We used theCT method to calculate changes
compared to control vehicle-injected or sham-operated mice.

in phosphate buffer. Their brains
were collected and postfixed overnight and then
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight, and
then 30m coronal sections were cut on a freezing
sliding microtome. Sections through the
striatum were stained with cresyl violet. To determine
whether the lack of endogenous CNTF
would affect tissue loss and astrogliosis, every
sixth brain section through the injured striatum
fromCNTF/mice and their wild-type littermates
was immunostained using rabbit anti-
GFAP primary antibodies (1:1000; AB5804;
Millipore) and Alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500; A11008
Invitrogen). To detect those cells that would express
CNTF following stroke, sections through
the injured striatum were stained with chicken
antibodies against-galactosidase (1:500; Ab28951;
Abcam) and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000; AB5804;
Millipore), with appropriate fluorescent secondary
antibodies.

Results
Rapid and large increases in CNTF
expression after a 15 min MCAO
A 15 min MCAO resulted in a large injury
throughout most of the striatum and in a
small region of the overlying cortex (data
not shown). Striatal CNTF expression was
already increased more than twofold1hafter
the MCAO and increased steadily up to
24 h, when it was approximately sevenfold
compared to the values obtained from
sham-operated mice (bothp0.001; Fig.
1A,B). The increase progressed to13-
fold after3dto30-fold after 14 d (all
p 0.001). The slope of the increase was
greatest over the first 24 h, whereas the
rate of increase leveled off between 3 and
14 d (Fig. 1C).
Stroke-induced CNTF expression is
in astrocytes
To determine which cells expressed CNTF
following the MCAO, we stained sections
through the injury site with antibodies
against -gal in heterozygous CNTF reporter
mice. Essentially all -gal-positive
cells also had GFAP-positive processes as
shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). The
number of -gal-positive cells was much
lower than the number of GFAP-positive
astrocytes, suggesting that only a subset of
cells express enough CNTF to be clearly detectable.
The distribution of -gal-positive
cells was distributed evenly throughout the
striatal injury site at 1 d following MCAO
and was predominant in the dense glial networkintheinjurypenumbraat14d
(Fig.3).

15 min MCAO. Hoechst staining was used to identify the nuclei. Two nuclei of-gal-positive cells are indicated by arrows in each
panel.

A clear GFAP-negative area indicated that astrocytes also died in the
core of the injury. There were no-gal-positive cells in this core. As
Yang et al. (2008) reported previously, staining was also seen in the
subventricular zone astrocytes both on the injured and uninjured
side.
Selective neuronal degeneration causes similar CNTF increases
as MCAO
The finding that the most rapid phase of the CNTF increase after
MCAO was seen over the first 24 h suggested that neuronal degeneration
might be responsible for the increase. Therefore, FVB
mice received intrastriatal injections with quinolinic acid, which
resulted in extensive loss of striatal neurons after 4 d (Fig. 4A).
We used FVB mice, as C57BL/6 mice are much less or inconsistently
susceptible to quinolinic acid-induced neuronal death
(Schauwecker, 2005) (T. Hagg, unpublished observation). Neuronal
death is progressive and is largely complete by 4 d after
quinolinic acid injury. The increase in striatal CNTF expression
in these mice was of a similar magnitude as that seen 1 d following
a 15 min MCAO in FVB mice (Fig. 4C), when neurons are also
clearly lost (Fig. 4B). The2.5-fold increase in CNTF in FVB
mice in response to the MCAO is lower than the approximately
sevenfold change seen in C57BL/6 mice, which is most likely due
to strain differences.
Neuronal contact downregulates CNTF expressionin vitro
To confirm that cocultured neurons cause a decrease in CNTF
expression, primary cortical neurons were seeded on astrocyte
monolayers. CNTF expression was much lower in cocultures
than in pure astrocyte cultures as measured by qPCR (Fig. 5A).
We next tested whether neuronal contact or soluble molecules
from neurons were responsible for the decrease in astroglial
CNTF. First, neuron–astrocyte cocultures were treated with
0.005% trypsin to disrupt intercellular contact of proteins, which
caused a 1.47 0.13-fold (SEM; p 0.05) increase in CNTF
expression after 6 h (Fig. 5B) with no visible loss of neurons or
astrocytes (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that soluble
agents were involved in the neuronal repression of CNTF,
neuronal conditioned media was added to pure astroglial cultures
, which did not affect the levels of CNTF expression (Fig.
5C).Moreover,coculturesofneuronsandastrocytesseparatedby
a semipermeable membrane in Boyden chambers also did not
affect astroglial CNTF expression (Fig. 5D). Though these experiments
rule out many diffusible factors, they do not address the
possibility that neurotransmitters may be released at synapses
and thus do not diffuse over longer distances. We therefore tested
whether several neurotransmitters prevalent in the striatum
would affect CNTF in cocultures. However, glutamate, acetylcholine
, and GABA did not affect CNTF expression (Fig. 5E). To
test the possibility that endogenous glutamate could play a role in
regulating CNTF, the NMDA antagonist MK-801 was added to
the culture, but was also without a significant effect (Fig. 5E). As
a control, dopamine caused a decrease in CNTF expression to
0.33 0.06-fold of control (p 0.01) in cocultures (Fig. 5E)
(Rudge et al., 1994; Nagao et al., 1995). These data suggested that
soluble factors and neurotransmitters play no role or a very limited
role in the regulation of CNTF. We therefore investigated the
possibility of contact-mediated CNTF repression through integrins.
Incubation of C6 cells with integrin-blocking RGDS peptide
induced CNTF expression 1.620.17-fold seen with the inactive
control RGES peptide (Fig. 5F). RGDS peptide-mediated CNTF
induction was abolished by pretreatment of cells with the transcriptional
blocker actinomysin. Together, these data suggest that
contact through integrin signaling suppresses CNTF expression
and that CNTF induction upon integrin blockade occurs at the
transcriptional level, i.e., requires RNA polymerase II activity.
Ischemic conditions minimally affect CNTF expression
Others have developed an ischemic solution mimicking the metabolic
conditions of an ischemic stroke and have shown its utility
as an experimental tool (Yao et al., 2007). Among the main ingredients
are glutamate, glucose, and a pH of 6.4. Injection of this
ischemic solution into the striatum of naive mice increased
CNTF levels by only 18% by 1 h (Fig. 6A), compared to the
230% seen 1 h after MCAO (Fig. 1A). To test whether the
hypoxic conditions of the MCAO might be involved in the rapid

CNTF increases, we exposed naive mice to severe hypoxia (decreasing
oxygen levels to a minimum of 5% for 10 min). CNTF
expression levels in the striatum were unaffected (Fig. 6B). Finally
, C6 cells were exposed to different severities of oxygenglucose
deprivation, an accepted in vitro model for ischemia
(Goldberg and Choi, 1993). CNTF levels were not significantly
increased after 4 h OGD (Fig. 6C). Cultured C6 cells can produce
CNTF (Meyer and Unsicker, 1994) and increase production after
mechanical trauma (M. P. Keasey and T. Hagg, unpublished
observation).
Inflammation has little effect on CNTF levels following MCAO
To test whether inflammation might have contributed to the
stroke-induced increases in CNTF, we injected the inflammatory
cytokines IFN and IL6 into the striatum of naive mice. Others
have shown that IFNwas the only of many growth factors tested
to increase astroglial CNTF in culture (Carroll et al., 1993), and
IL6 increased CNTF in dorsal root ganglion culture (Shuto et al.,
2001). Both are increased after stroke (Clark et al., 1999; de Bilbao
et al., 2009). Here, IFNhad no effect, and IL6 increased CNTF in
the striatum only by twofold after 24 h (Fig. 7A), compared to the
more than sevenfold increase seen after MCAO. Stem cell factor

(SCF) has been shown to increase CNTF expression and to have
anti-inflammatory properties in cultured microglia (Zhang and
Fedoroff, 1998). It is increased in the penumbra of traumatic
brain injury (Sun et al., 2004), where CNTF also increases (Ip,
1998). However, SCF did not increase CNTF expression 24 h after
injection into the naive striatum (Fig. 7A). CNTF itself has been
shown to activate microglia (Hagg et al., 1993). A single injection
of CNTF in the striatum of naive mice caused an increase of
1.560.07-fold (p0.001) after 24 h (Fig. 7A), suggesting the
existence of autocrine regulation mechanism to increase CNTF
expression via the gp130 receptor complex. To test whether inflammation
contributed to the progressive increase over the first
week after MCAO, mice were treated with daily intraperitoneal
injections with anti-inflammatory drugs from1dto7dfollowing
MCAO. We started the treatment 24 h after the MCAO to reduce
the potential impact of the neuroprotective actions of these antiinflammatory
drugs, i.e., to reduce the confounding impact of
less neuronal cell death, which would be expected to lead to less of
an increase in CNTF levels. Minocycline, which is known to reduce
microglial activation and inflammation (Yrja ¨nheikki et al.,
1999), and the known anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacine
and ketoprofen had no significant effect on the CNTF levels following
MCAO compared to saline controls (Fig. 7B).
Increased CNTF plays a protective role following MCAO
We were interested in understanding what the pathophysiological
role of the increased striatal CNTF following MCAO might be.
In light of the neuroprotective effects of CNTF treatments, we set
out to determine whether the endogenous CNTF response would
contribute to improved outcomes. A 30 min MCAO caused a
substantial injury to the striatum and overlying cortex in wildtype
mice as shown by cresyl violet-stained sections 2 weeks after
injury (Fig. 8A). In CNTF/ mice, the injury appeared to be
larger (Fig. 8B), which was confirmed by quantification of the
injured area (Fig. 8E). The area of the normal side of the brain
was not different between the genotypes (data not shown).
GFAP-stained sections also showed a clear demarcated region of
infarcted, GFAP-negative tissue that was larger in CNTF/
mice (Fig. 8C–E). The CNTF measurements in this study were all
from the striatum, and we separately analyzed the injury in the
striatum.CNTF/mice also had a larger area of injury within
the striatum as measured by the absence of GFAP staining (Fig.
8C–E). CNTF has been shown to play a role in gliosis after spinal
cord injury (Ishii et al., 2006). However, there was no significant
difference in the area occupied by the GFAP-stained astroglial
processes within the striatum, whether measured by the total
number of pixels or recalculated as a percentage of the surviving
striatal tissue (as identified by GFAP staining; Fig. 8E). Moreover,
the increase in GFAP seen in the neighboring septum was similar
between the CNTF/ and wild-type mice (data not shown).
Together, these data suggest that the increase in striatal CNTF
expression following MCAO is protective for both neurons and
astrocytes.
Discussion
Our data suggest that pathological disruption of neuronal interactions
with astrocytes leads to rapid and large increases in CNTF
expression, which has a cell-protective role. Conversely, normal
neuron–astrocyte interaction greatly suppresses astrocytic CNTF
expression in vivo and in astrocytes in cocultures, as also shown
by Rudge et al. (1994). The contact-mediated nature of the normal
repression is supported by the finding that CNTF increased
in vitro after mild trypsinization, which would disrupt proteins
on the cell surfaces. The similarity in the effects of the pure striatal
neuronal quinolinic acid injury in adult mice and the MCAO also
supports the idea that loss of neuronal contact is sufficient to
induce CNTFin vivo. Moreover, the most rapid increase in CNTF
was seen during the acute postischemic phase. Once the neurons
are lost at 1 d, the CNTF increase slows down in the following
days. Conversely, soluble neuronal molecules did not affect
CNTF expression, as shown with neuronal cocultures in a transwell
system or neuronal-conditioned media. The MCAO most
likely did not increase CNTF by the expected changes in neurotransmitter
levels following the injury, as suggested by the lack
of an effect of glutamate or GABA on CNTF expression in cultured
astrocytes. CNTF regulation by glutamate seems even less
likely since the potent NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 had
no effectin vitro. CNTF regulation might be unique compared to
other neurotrophic factors, including BDNF and NGF, which are
regulated by glutamate and GABA (Zafra et al., 1991, 1992; Wu et
al., 2004). If correct, this suggests that CNTF plays a unique role

Intrastriatal injection of the proinflammatory cytokines IL6 or IFN in naive mice induces a
much smaller increase or does not increase CNTF expression after 24 h, respectively, compared

in vitro, has an inhibitory effect. Interestingly, CNTF appears to have autocrine functions as
shown by its positive effects on CNTF expression.B, Systemic administration of three different
anti-inflammatory drugs, minocycline (Mino), indomethacin (Indo), and ketoprofen (Keto),

in the CNS and may enable the development
of pharmacological agents that predominantly
regulate CNTF. The molecular
mechanisms underlying the normal neuronal
contact-mediated CNTF repression in
astrocytes in vivo remain to be determined.
Our findingin vitrothat blocking RGD peptide
increases CNTF suggests that it is normallyrepressedbyintegrins.Thosedataalso
suggest that the increased CNTF expression
is dependent on transcription and thus is
regulated by intracellular signaling pathways.
This is consistent with the very rapid
nature of the increase following MCAO in
vivo, which would be difficult to explain
with posttranscriptional mechanisms, given
that CNTF mRNA has a half-life of 7 h.
MCAO is an ischemic injury causing
both anoxia/hypoxia and lack of glucose.
However, these metabolic effects most likely
did not affect the striatal CNTF levels, as intrastriatalinjectionofasolutionthatmimics
the metabolic conditions measured within
an ischemic injury (Yao et al., 2007) or severe
whole-body hypoxia was without effect.
Moreover, OGD, an accepted model of
ischemic stroke (Ve ´ga et al., 2006), had no
effect on CNTF levels in a glial cell line. We
considered whether inflammation might
regulate CNTF, as it is a known consequence
of MCAO injury (Dirnagl et al.,
1999) and can activate astrocytes (Sofroniew
, 2005). However, intrastriatal injection
of the proinflammatory cytokines IL6
and IFNin naive mice had a small effect or
no effect, respectively, on CNTF expression
compared to MCAO at 24 h. The increase in
CNTF after the first day also does not seem
to be regulated by inflammation, as three
different anti-inflammatory drugs did not
affect the levels of MCAO-induced CNTF at
1 week. The slower progressive increase is
most likely not directly regulated by loss of
neuronal contact, as it occurred after the
neurons had already died. Autocrine CNTF
might contribute to this progressive nature,
givenourfindingthatintrastriatalCNTFinjections
in naive mice increased CNTF expression.
Also, CNTF treatment enhances
retinal ganglion cell regeneration in part via
stimulating endogenous CNTF (Mu ¨ller et
al., 2009).
The rapid increase in CNTF expression
following MCAO is consistent with the
idea that it is an injury factor important
for regulation of biological processes during the acute injury
phase. The later apparent slower rise in CNTF may be related to
repair. The CNTF distribution data following stroke would be
consistent with the idea that the rescue response is diffuse in areas
that survive, whereas the repair response is in the penumbra,
perhaps related to blood–brain barrier repair. CNTF is most
likely not involved in the reactive gliosis given the similar glial
activation seen inCNTF/and their wild-type littermates following
MCAO (present study), optic nerve injury (Martin et al.,
2003), and spinal cord injury (T. Hagg, unpublished observation
). In fact, the time course of astrocyte activation in
CNTF/ mice was even accelerated following optic nerve injury
(Martin et al., 2003), raising the possibility that CNTF plays
an inhibitory feedback role in glial reactivity. The neuronal
contact-mediated inhibition in astrocytes raises the possibility
that CNTF plays an important reciprocal role in this close inter-

cellular relationship and that the injury-induced CNTF primarily
serves to protect neurons. In other words, the rapid glial CNTF
response might be an indication of a glial sensor system for neuronal
stress or pathological changes that is exaggerated in MCAO
but might also play a role in other more slowly progressing
disorders.
The MCAO is known to induce rapid increases in both CNTF
mRNA and protein (Hu et al., 1997; Park et al., 2000; Leibinger et al.,
2009). CNTF is most likely released from the astrocytes and biologically
active, as suggested by the neuroprotective effects seen in the
wild-type mice compared to their CNTF/ littermates. Rescue
experiments by injecting CNTF inCNTF/mice would solidify
whether endogenous CNTF is neuroprotective or whether
developmental differences inCNTF/mice predisposed them
to worse ischemic injuries. On the other hand, the striatal neurons
are directly responsive to CNTF, as suggested by their expression
of the specific CNTFreceptor (Ip et al., 1993b; Emsley
and Hagg, 2003) and the findings that CNTF treatments can
rescue them in vitro (Peterse ´n and Brundin, 1999) and in vivo
(Anderson et al., 1996; Emerich et al., 1997; Zala et al., 2004).
CNTF treatments can also lead to enhanced recovery following
ischemic stroke in rats (Kumon et al., 1996). Alternatively or
additionally, endogenous CNTF could reduce degeneration following
MCAO by enhancing astroglial glutamate uptake to reduce
excitotoxicity (Escartin et al., 2006; Beurrier et al., 2010).
CNTF expression is normally very low in the CNS, including the
striatum (Stockli et al., 1989), and the rapid increase combined
with its neuroprotective effects suggests that its main role might
be as a lesion factor. Based on the morphology of the injury,
which contains a central degenerated core after ischemic stroke,
the protection most likely preserves penumbral neuronal tissue.
Whereas the core dies by necrosis, the penumbral neuronal loss is
characterized by apoptosis (Ferrer and Planas, 2003) and progresses
over several hours following stroke (Heiss and Graf, 1994;
Lo, 2008). This suggests that the initial increase in endogenous
CNTF levels is quick enough to rescue these penumbral neurons,
but not quick enough to rescue those more severely injured ones
within the core. It is also possible that apoptosis but not necrosis
can be counteracted by CNTF. However, CNTF treatments can
rescue neurons against NMDA toxicity (Anderson et al., 1996;
Emerich et al., 1997), which is one of the main mechanisms by
which the ischemic core neurons die (Lipton, 2006; Rossi et al.,
2007). Interestingly, the injury core is devoid of GFAP-positive
astrocytes, as also shown by others who found fluorojade staining
in penumbral astrocytes (Butler et al., 2002), suggesting that the
astrocytes also degenerate after ischemia. OurCNTF/mouse
data suggest that their enhanced astrocyte loss following MCAO
is caused by the lack of CNTF. Astrocytes express CNTFreceptors
(Emsley and Hagg, 2003; Choi et al., 2004) but so far have not
been shown to be dependent on CNTF for their survival under
pathological conditions. The loss of CNTF-producing astrocytes
in the core of the injury might explain why the core neurons
degenerate.
The question arises whether CNTF’s role as a highly regulatable
protein might also play a physiological role in the normal
CNS as a rapid responder to and controller of neuronal function.
Astrocytes are now viewed as the third component of the synapse
to regulate neurotransmission (Barker and Ullian, 2010; Freeman
, 2010; Giaume et al., 2010; Panatier et al., 2011). Thus, it is
not surprising that CNTF can enhance normal synaptic function
(Stoop and Poo, 1996; Nai et al., 2010) and reduce synaptic degeneration
and cognitive defects in a mouse Alzheimer model
(Garcia et al., 2010). In culturedXenopusmotor neurons, CNTF
application to the soma potentiates synaptic function within 10
min, and a bit more slowly when applied to the neuromuscular
synapse (Stoop and Poo, 1995). This suggests that CNTF can
modulate somatic control of synaptic function on a relatively
short time scale. Its highly regulatable nature by neuron–astrocyte
contact would make CNTF a very adaptable modulator of
synaptic function. CNTF could affect normal transmission directly
via neuronal receptors on the soma or synapse (Stoop and
Poo, 1995) or by modulating astroglial glutamate transporters
(Escartin et al., 2006).
Finally, we propose that a better understanding of the mechanisms
that regulate CNTF expression would help us to more
rationally design pharmacological treatments to boost the natural
neuroprotective response to injury as well as its normal physiological
roles in synaptic transmission. For example, further
increasing or accelerating the endogenous increase in response to
ischemia might help recovery, given the finding that exogenous
CNTF can do the same (Kumon et al., 1996). CNTF is a good
drug target, as it is almost exclusively produced in nervous system.
Thus, systemic drugs that increase its production would
help to circumvent CNTF’s poor bioavailability to the CNS and
peripheral side effects when given systemically (Thoenen and
Sendtner, 2002).
