Abstract
Levels of cerebral amyloid, presumably β-amyloid (Abeta), toxicity and the incidence of
cortical and subcortical ischemia increases with age. However, little is known about the
severe pathological condition and dementia that occur as a result of the comorbid occurrence
of this vascular risk factor and Abeta toxicity. Clinical studies have indicated that
small ischemic lesions in the striatum are particularly important in generating dementia in
combination with minor amyloid lesions. These cognitive deficits are highly likely to be
caused by changes in the cortex. In this study, we examined the viability and morphological
changes in microglial and neuronal cells, gap junction proteins (connexin43) and neuritic/
axonal retraction (Fer Kinase) in the striatum and cerebral cortex using a comorbid rat
model of striatal injections of endothelin-1 (ET1) and Abeta toxicity. The results demonstrated
ventricular enlargement, striatal atrophy, substantial increases in β-amyloid, ramified
microglia and increases in neuritic retraction in the combined models of stroke and
Abeta toxicity. Changes in connexin43 occurred equally in both groups of Abeta-treated
rats, with and without focal ischemia. Although previous behavioral tests demonstrated
impairment in memory and learning, the visual discrimination radial maze task did not
show significant difference, suggesting the cognitive impairment in these models is not
related to damage to the dorsolateral striatum. These results suggest an insight into the
relationship between cortical/striatal atrophy, pathology and functional impairment.
INTRODUCTION
Focal ischemia in different parts of the brain leads to transient
accumulation and increased β-amyloid precursor protein (APP)
processing in the regions adjacent to the periphery of ischemic
lesion and white matter, including the cortex (1, 23, 36), suggesting
an interplay between ischemia and β-amyloid pathology. Similarly
, an increasing number of epidemiological studies indicate that
cerebral ischemia significantly increases the risk of, potentially
preventable, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) or poststroke
dementia, including dementia of the Alzheimer type (18, 56). It is
not known whether this is caused by unmasking of preexisting
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or development of new AD lesions,
where β-amyloid (Aβ) appears to play a critical role in
neurotoxicity. These observations emphasize the need to identify
overlapping molecular mechanisms associated with combinations
of cerebral ischemia and VCI or dementia related to β-amyloid
pathology. In this regard, a study carried out in 1997 demonstrated
that the comorbid occurrence of subcortical lacunar infarcts and
AD lesions resulted in significantly more dementia compared with
either condition alone as well as with cortical infarcts and AD
lesions (43). The validity of this concept was confirmed in a
population study (12). In some familial forms of AD, Aβ deposition
starts in striatum (22) as well as ventral striatum is the brain
region that showed Aβdeposition early in AD pathology inin vivo
β-amyloid imaging (22). Such infarcts can precipitate the development
of AD (43, 49). Subjects with a given density of cortical
neurofibrillary tangles have lower cognitive performance in the
presence of infarcts, and this effect is even more marked for small
lacunar than large hemispheric infarcts (16, 43).
We have previously conducted studies to examine the combined
effect of striatal ischemia and β-amyloid toxicity on
neuroinflammation, β-amyloid and tau accumulation, behavioral
changes (53), and ischemia size (52). More recently, we have
provided mechanistic insight into the relationship between
hippocampal pathology and progenitor cells and function (5). In
addition, these previous investigations have provided some important
insight that has been used to guide clinical studies using
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which suggests that
following stroke, cortical amyloid and white matter inflammation
independently contribute to impaired cognition (45). However, it is
expected that the extensive connectivity of the striatum with the

neocortex would result in substantive changes in this latter site, as
there has been little attention paid to the changes that might be
occurring in the neocortex as a consequence of striatal ischemia
and β-amyloid toxicity. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that
mimicking the clinical condition of combined striatal infarcts and
β-amyloid toxicity will lead to exacerbated neuroinflammation and
accumulation of APP fragments in both cortical and striatal
regions of the brain, with evidence of cell-injury, faulty cell-to-cell
communication and axonal growth in the neocortex. Hence, in the
present investigation we examined changes in the striatum and
the neocortex in the combined model of cerebral ischemia and
β-amyloid toxicity to determine the relationship between
microglia, cells displaying high levels of APP proteolytic fragments
, degeneration, connexin43 gap junction protein involved in
intercellular communication and the extent of neuritic retraction as
depicted by the high levels of Fer Kinase. In addition, exploration
of behavioral impairments has also been limited to hippocampus
and cortical tasks, and not included tasks related to lesions in the
dorsolateral striatum (26, 27, 32) that was also performed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal, treatment and tissue preparation
All animal protocols were carried out according to the guidelines of
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Western University
(approval ID: 2008-113). Male Wistar rats (250 g to 310 g—) were
anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p., Ceva,
SanteAnimale, Montreal, Canada).The animals were positioned in
a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA,
USA) with the incisor bar below the interaural line, set at 3.3 mm.
Body temperatures were maintained at 37°C.To insert the stainless
steel cannula (30-gauge), small burr holes were drilled in the
parietal bone. There were four groups of animals (n =4–7 for each
group). To model striatal ischemia (ET1 group), a single injection
of 6 pmol endothelin-1 (ET1; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON,
Canada) per 3 μL (dissolved in saline) was made into the right
striatum through the cannula (anterior/posterior: +0.5 mm, medial/
lateral: −3.0 mm relative to bregma, and dorsoventral: −5.0 mm
belowdura).Theratmodelof β-amyloidtoxicity(Aβgroup)iswell
established (10, 41). Briefly, Aβ25-35 peptide (Bachem, Torrance,
CA, USA) at 50 nmol/10 μL dissolved in saline was injected into
the lateral ventricles bilaterally (anterior/posterior: −0.8 mm,
mediolateral: ±1.4 mm relative to bregma, and dorsoventral:
−4.0 mm below dura). This model of β-amyloid toxicity has been
chosen because the toxic fragment,Aβ25-35, has been found inAD
brains (21, 24) and shown in more than a number ofin vivo(10, 41,
53) and in vitro (6) studies to be a trigger of neurodegeneration,
neuroinflammation with reactive astrocytosis and cognitive deficits
[reviewed in (20)]. A further advantage of using Aβ25-35 is to
induce modest pathological changes that can be combined with a
smallischemiamodeltoexaminetheinteractions.Forratsreceiving
bothbilateralintracerebroventricular(ICV)Aβ25-35injectionsand
unilateral ET1 injections (Aβ+ET1 group), the Aβ25-35 peptide
injection into the lateral ventricles was followed by the ET1 injectionintothestriatum.Theshamrats
(SHAMgroup)receivedallthe
surgical steps without injections of Aβ25-35 or ET1. Paxinos and
Watson (34) atlas was used to determine all stereotaxic coordinates.
FollowingET1,Aβ25-35orsalineinjections,thecannulawasleftin
situ for 3 minutes before removing slowly. After suturing the
wound, all rats received subcutaneous injection of 30 μg/kg
buprenorphine and an intramuscular injection of 20 μL (50 mg/mL
stock)enrofloxacinantibiotic(Baytril,BayerInc.,Toronto,Canada)
and were subsequently allowed to recover from surgery. Three
weeks after surgery, all the animals were euthanized by an overdose
(160 mg/kg) of pentobarbital i.p. injection and transaortically
perfused, first with heparinized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The brains were
removed, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and cryoprotected
by immersion in 30% sucrose for 36 h at 4°C. Animals
for western blotting were sacrificed by cervical decapitation, brains
were removed immediately and snap-frozen by immersing in liquid
nitrogen. Fresh frozen brains were kept at −80°C until used for
biochemical studies.
Histology
Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial, coronal sections
of the entire brain, 35-μm in thickness using a sliding microtome
(Tissue-Tek® Cryo3® Microtome/Cryostat, Sakura Finetek, CA,
USA) for cryoprotected brains. Sections were then stained with
antibodies against ramified microglia (OX-6, BD Pharmingen,
Mississauga, Canada, 554926, 1:1000), APP, Abeta and its fragment
17-24 (4G8, Signet, Covance, Emeryville, CA, USA, 9220-
10), neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN, Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA, MAB377, 1:200) and the gap junction protein
connexin43 (Cx43; Sigma-Aldrich, C6219, 1:600). Briefly, parallel
series of free-floating, cryoprotected sections were incubated with
1% H2O2 in 0.1 M PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, with
serum in 0.1 M PBS for 1 h at room temperature, with primary
antibodies in 0.1 M PBS for 24 h at 4°C, with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies [OX-6 andAβ; horse anti-mouse (BA-2000)]
in 0.1 M PBS for 1 h at room temperature, with 2% of avidin–biotin
complex (ABC) in 0.1 M PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,
sections were incubated with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) and 50 μL of 1% H2O2 for 15
minutes at room temperature. After each incubation step, sections
were washed with 0.1 M PBS four times for 5 minutes each. Finally,
all sections were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and
cleared in xylene before cover slipping with Depex (Depex, BDH
Chemicals, Poole, UK). Serums, ABC reagent and biotinylated
antibodies were from the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories
, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Negative controls included
all histological procedures with no primary antibody added.
FluoroJade B (FJB) staining
Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, air-dried,
dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and placed in 0.06%
potassium permanganate solution for 15 minutes before rinsing in
distilled water. Next, sections were placed in 0.0004% FJB
(Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) solution for 20
minutes, rinsed in distilled water, cleared in xylene and cover
slipped using Depex.
Quantitative western blotting
Detergent-resistant cortical membranes were isolated based on
their insolubility in TritonX-100 at 4°C and their ability to float in

sucrose density gradients. Fresh frozen brain cortices from both
hemispheres were homogenized in 1.0 mL of PTN 50 buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM
NaCl) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride, 5 μg leupeptin and 1 μg pepstatin A, and centrifuged
at 12 000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove insoluble material.
The remaining supernatant was diluted with equal volumes of 80%
sucrose. Samples were carefully overlaid with equal volumes of
30% and 5% sucrose, respectively. The gradient was centrifuged
at 130 000 ×g (average) for 20 h at 4°C in a Beckman L8-70
Ultracentrifuge (SW40-400 rotor; Beckman Coulter, Mississauga,
Canada) and aliquoted into 600-μL fractions. Membrane raftcontaining
fractions were tracked by the enrichment of the
dendritic membrane raft marker flotillin-1 (BD Biosciences
Mississauga, Canada, 610820, 1:1000) using sodium dodecyl
sulphate-western blotting. Raft-containing and raft-free fractions
were pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters
(Millipore) and probed with anti-Fer Kinase (Abcam, Abcam,
Toronto, Canada, ab79573, 1:1000). Data analysis was performed
using the Molecular Analyst II densitometric software (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA).
Cognitive testing
A subset of 40 animals (10 rats/group) underwent testing in the
Morris water maze, discriminative fear-conditioning to context
task and visual discrimination radial maze tasks. While the
methods and results of the Morris water maze and discriminative
fear-conditioning to context tasks have been described recently
(5), this paper describes only the visual discrimination radial maze
task. The apparatus for visual discrimination radial maze task was
the same as used previously (33). Briefly, an eight-arm radial maze
elevated 60 cm from the floor with a 40-cm diameter center platform
and 60 cm ×9 cm arms were used. Small light bulbs were
affixed on the inner side of each arm and a food cup was located at
the end of each arm in the floor of the arm. The maze was in a
305 cm ×216 cm room illuminated underneath by a lamp. Following
all behavioral testing, the eight-arm radial maze was wiped
clean with detergent and water. Animals were food-deprived to
90% of their body weight for 7 days before testing.All feeding was
conducted after behavioral testing. Pre-exposure: Animals were
allowed to freely roam the eight-arm radial maze for 10 minutes.
All arms were open and no food reward was present at any food
cups located at the ends of the arms.Visual discrimination task:All
arms of the maze remained open throughout testing. Animals were
trained for 21 consecutive days. Animals were given 10 minutes to
complete the training trial. A trial consisted of placing the animal
in the middle of the maze facing the east. A light at the end of the
arm indicated a food cup containing a food reward (ie, baited). If
an animal entered a baited arm and ate the reward, the light was
turned off. The number of entered arms as well as total time spent
in the maze was recorded. If an animal ate all food rewards, they
were promptly removed from the radial maze. If they reached the
10-minute mark without eating all the food rewards, they were
removed from the apparatus and returned to their home cage. Four
out of eight arms were baited with food every day, and the determination
of which arms were baited each day was randomly
assigned.
Analyses
Data analyses were done blindly and with adequate allocation
concealment. Histological analyses of brain sections were carried
out under light and fluorescence microscopy. Photomicrographs
were taken using a Leica Digital Camera DC 300 (Leica
Microsystems Ltd., Heerbrugg, Switzerland) attached to Leitz
Diaplan Microscope. Digitized images acquired using a 10×objective
were saved as TIFF files with an identical level of sharpness
and contrast using the IM50 software. The striatum volumes were
determined on histological sections using the Image J (version
4.11b, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) by tracing the striatal area
quantification plug-in analysis tool on the computer screen. The
volumes (mm3) were calculated by integrating the corresponding
areas with the interval thickness of sections. Cells were counted
within the entire striatum and neocortex. Ten sections were studied
from each brain, taken from the anterior to posterior levels (1.7 to
−3.14 from the bregma) with intervals of 144 μm. Cellular densities
on each of the 10 slices (expressed as the number of stained
cells per mm2in the optical field) were calculated as the arithmetic
mean number of cells in the ipsilateral hemispheres for each
animal. The results were displayed as the numbers of stained cells
per millimeter of each region analyzed.
Statistical analyses
All values were presented as mean ±standard error of the mean
(SEM). Volumetric measurements were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and/or Student’s unpaired twotailed t-tests. Number of Aβ, OX6, Cx43, FJB-labeled cells,
behavioral task and Fer Kinase densitometric levels were analyzed
using one-way ANOVA, followed bypost hocTukey’s (β-amyloid,
OX6, Cx43, FJB, visual discrimination radial maze) and Dunnett’s
(Fer K) tests. The significance level was P ≤0.05.
RESULTS
Striatal atrophy and pathology
The combined Aβ+ET1 rats exhibited several hallmark features
indicative of a degenerating brain. First, in coronal tissue sections
(Figure 1A), there was evidence of forebrain lateral ventricle
enlargement ofAβ+ET1 rat brains in comparison to those of sham,
ET1 and Aβ rats, as shown by us recently (5), which was closely
accompanied by tissue loss in the striatum of the Aβ+ET1 rats
(12.7% ±3.6%) (Figure 1B). In addition, the area of inflammation
associated with the infarct, as measured with the OX6 staining,
was also increased in Aβ+ET1 rats compared with ET1 alone.
Bilateral injections of Aβ25-35 in ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats have
been shown to elevate the deposition of APP fragments including
β-amyloid (Figure 1C–E) (53) in the cells that appear to be small,
pyknotic or round-shaped degenerating neurons. The lower
number of Aβ positive neuronal cells in Aβ+ET1 rats also indicates
the loss of neurons in these rats compared with ET1 rats
alone. The anti-Aβ antibody (9220-10; 4G8) used in this study
recognizes the 17–24 amino acids ofAβpeptide, which is different
from the Aβ (25-35) sequence of the injected β-amyloid peptide.

concentrated in the ipsilateral dorsolateral striatum of ET1 and
Aβ+ET1 rat brains compared with sham and Aβrats, significantly
more in the Aβ+ET1 brains than in the ET1 group. The majority of
the OX6 positive cells found in striatum showed highly ramified
structures (Figure 1F,G). Cx43 immunostaining increased bilaterally
in both theAβandAβ+ET1 rats but did not show any increased
staining in the ET1 rats compared with sham (Figure 1H,I).
To examine the cellular degeneration, we used FJB (polyanionic
fluorescein derivative) that has been shown to stain injured neurons
as a result of acute insult (39), although it could also label
astrocytes and microglia (11) during a chronic neurodegenerative
process. We found significant numbers of FJB+ degenerative cells
with a distinct microglial and neuronal morphology surrounding
the ischemic lesion at the motor cortex level and lateral ventricles
at the somatosensory cortex level in the ipsilateral striatum in ET1
and Aβ+ET1 rat brains, significantly more in the Aβ+ET1 brains
than in the ET1 group (Figure 1J,K). It is important to note that
identical brain regions showed dense staining for ramified
microglial cells (OX6 stain), indicating that 21 days after the insult
most of the microglial cells were at the verge of degeneration.

Nevertheless, a small proportion of FJB+ cells in the injured
striatum, according to their morphology, appeared to be degenerating
neurons (inset—white line). Sham brains, contralateral
striatum and Aβrats did not show any significant staining for FJB.
Cortical pathology
In the animals with only ishemia (ET1), there were increased
numbers of Aβ, OX6 and FJB positive cells at the levels of motor
and somatosensory cortices, close to layer VI compared with sham
rats (Figure 2). Rats withAβalone showed a significant increase in
OX6, Cx43 and FJB staining at the level of somatosensory cortex
(Figure 2A–I). The combination of Aβ toxicity and ischemia
(Aβ+ET1) showed an overall cortical increase (than both Aβ and
ET1) in APP fragments (including β-amyloid) in cells with typical
neuronal morphology (inset) (Figure 2B,C), as well as increases in
OX6 staining in ramified microglial cells with stout cell bodies
(inset) (Figure 2D,E) and Cx43 (Figure 2F,G), and finally FJB
staining in both microglial (inset—arrow) and neuronal (inset—
line) cells (Figure 2H,I).
Axonal and dendritic changes
A feature of pathogenesis in degenerating brains such as AD,
includes axonal and dendritic atrophy (47). For these reasons, we
investigated changes in neuronal morphology (NeuN) and Fer
tyrosine kinase (Fer Kinase) in the cortex. Fer kinase is an early
marker for axonal retraction and degeneration (40). Although,
NeuN is not primarily used as a marker of neuronal retraction, we
didobserveanapparentdecreaseinthelengthofneuronalprocesses
(arrows) of typical pyknotic neurons in the ipsilateral cortex of
Aβ+ET1 rats compared with morphologically intact neurons in
sham rats (Figure 3A). This apparent decrease in the length of

with the results of the immunoblots of Fer Kinase that showed
bilaterally increased expression in both non-raft (Figure 3B,D) and
raft (Figure 3B,E) domains of Aβ+ET1 rat brains compared with
sham, ET1 and Aβ rats. The membrane raft marker flotillin-1 was
used to verify raft membrane fractions (Figure 3C). Non-raft Fer
Kinase levels within the ipsilateral cortex of ET1 rats were also
increased (Figure 3B,D). Plot F shows a significant difference in the
ratiobetweenraftandnon-raftFerKinaseproteinintheAβ+ET1rat
brains compared with sham (Figure 3F).
Cognitive testing
The visual discrimination radial maze task primarily requires an
intact dorsolateral striatum that is thought to be involved in the
acquisition of stimulus–response associations. Our results indicate
that all groups demonstrated normal acquisition at the same rate
over the course of 21 training days. No differences were observed
between any groups (Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
The clinical literature presents a compelling argument for the role
of vascular insults in potentiating neurodegeneration in vulnerable
brains, such as aging individuals with high levels of β-amyloid
and/or those developingAlzheimer’s-type pathologies (8, 15). Previously
, we have characterized some critical pathological changes
in combined models of β-amyloid toxicity and ischemia in both
transgenic mice (53) and non-transgenic rat models (5). These
models have been particularly effective in helping to determine
potential therapeutic agents that might dissociate the additive or
synergistic connection between the small focal ischemia and the
early pathological events of dementia such as high levels of
β-amyloid and neuroinflammation. The one brain area that is
potentially critically important in the cascade of events for the
interactions between ischemia and β-amyloid toxicity is the cerebral
cortex and at the site of the infarct in the striatum. This
particularly becomes important when, initially, AD emerged as a
type of cortical dementia mainly associated with the loss of large
pyramidal neurons primarily in the area of associative cortices
(35). In the present study we have undertaken a closer look at the
changes in the striatum and, in particular, the neocortex in a combined
model of β-amyloid toxicity and small striatal ischemia to
further investigate the exacerbated biochemical alterations in this
rat model.

On a gross anatomical level, the results indicated that the
comorbid occurrence of β-amyloid toxicity and striatal infarct
elicits enlargement in both the lateral ventricles and a trend toward
reduction in the volume of the striatum, suggesting there is a loss
or degeneration of striatal cells leading to compression or atrophy
of the striatum. It has been demonstrated that the progression from
mild cognitive impairment to AD is associated with ventricular
enlargement and this, in turn, is correlated with senile plaques and
neurofibrillary tangle deposition (42, 46).
By investigating several key components, we found a combination
of several underlying degenerative effects that might suggest
mechanisms that lead to abnormalities in forebrain architecture.
The first characteristic finding is a considerably larger increase in
cortical and striatal β-amyloid in the Aβ25-35 seeded brains in the
presence of a relatively small ischemic infarct in the striatum. The
increased APP processing and/or endogenous production of
β-amyloid in AβandAβ+ET1 rat brains is likely triggered by Aβ
25-35 ICV injections or seeding similar to some of the pathological
changes we observed in previous studies (5, 10, 50). The highhydrophobic
amino acids content ofAβ25-35 and their tendency to
aggregate more than the Aβ42 peptide, the neurotoxicity of
Aβ25-35 (5, 6, 10, 41, 42, 57) and its presence in the core of senile
plaques and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (24) reinforce its
potential involvement in the pathogenesis and etiology of AD.
This additional Aβ production could be either caused by the overexpression
of APP in neurons (as shown by us), astrocytes or
ramified microglia (6, 37). However, what remains to be determined
is the mechanism by which Aβ25-35 trigger leads to a greatly
enhanced initial increase in β-amyloid following the striatal infarct.
The second characteristic change that we identified was a large
increase in the density of ramified microglial cells and possibly an
upregulation of inflammatory mediators in ET1and Aβ+ET1 rat
brains in the striatum and neocortex. This neuroinflammatory
change is yet another common feature of neurodegenerative
pathologies and ischemic lesions (3). This observation is in
accordance with AD hallmarks, as Aβ peptides-induced toxicity,
proinflammatory mediators (37) and deposition of diffuse plaques
in the AD brain (2, 19) have been shown to induce microglial
activation. ET1 is a potent activator of microglia (25) and can
cause prominent microglial staining in rats receiving only ET1.
After the elimination of cell debris, in the remodeled adult brain,
phagocytic microglial cells rapidly transform into a ramified
microglial state (4, 44). Large numbers of these ramified microglia
are what we observe at the site of inflammation in the ET1and
Aβ+ET1 rat brains in both the striatum and even more significantly
in the neocortex, which could partly explain the formation of
dementia observed clinically when these two conditions coexist.
The third characteristic change we observed was an elevation in
Cx43 immunoreactivity in Aβand Aβ+ET1 rat brains. Interestingly
, the addition of ischemia toAβ25-35 injections resulted in no
additional increase in Cx43, suggesting that changes in these gap
junction proteins may not be part of the mechanism related to the
interaction of ischemia and β-amyloid toxicity. Microglial activation
promotes the release of glutamate and ATP through astrocytic
Cx43 hemichannels, which then can have detrimental effects on
neuronal survival (31). However, in our experiments, the Cx43
elevation in both Aβ groups and Aβ+ET1 rat brains is probably
independent of microglial activation as it was absent in ET1 injection
alone, which did, in fact, have prominent microglial activation.
Thus, in these experiments it appears that increased Cx43 expression
must be attributed to the direct effect of Aβ25-35 injection
and not mediated by microglia activation. Cx43 has been
co-localized with β-amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients
(29) and transgenic mice (28), suggesting a possible remodeling of
neuron–astrocyte interactions, which is perhaps the case in the
Aβ-injected animals.
ThefourthcharacteristicchangeweobservedwasprominentFJB
staining corresponding to cell injury in both the striatum and
neocortex. It is likely that the substantial cellular loss in the striatum
plays a role in causing the loss of striatal tissue in Aβ+ET1 brains.
Ischemic injury and neurodegenerative disorders share common
features of cell death, such as a molecularly regulated necrosis (48)
and/or caspase-mediated apoptosis (17). Common molecular pathways
bringing together neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration
havebeendescribed(9,55),asituationthatmightbepresentinET1,
AβandAβ+ET1 rats. Future investigations could be done to establish
the direct biochemical connections between the activation of
glial cells and caspase-3 (30). and the mechanisms these biochemical
connections play in the enhanced pathology in the combined
ischemia and β-amyloid toxicity.
The final characteristic change we observed was an apparent
decrease in axonal and dendritic length in the cortex of the combined
ischemia and Aβ25-35-injected rats. It has been shown that
β-amyloid deposits induce breakage of dendritic and axonal
branches in a mouse model ofAD (47). Very recently, we have also
shown aberrant dendritic morphology in neurons developing from
progenitor cells in the hippocampus of Aβ+ET1 rats (5). This
effect of β-amyloid may possibly be involved in altering the
appearance of axons and dendrites we observed in the cortical
regions of Aβ+ET1 rats, as these rats also had a significant
increase in endogenous amyloid. Fer Kinase (Fer K) is not only a
marker for neurodegeneration but also leads to neuritic retraction,
and is markedly increased during global and focal infarct and
during post cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (53). Domainspecific
bilateral amplification of cortical levels of Fer K into the
raft and non-raft membranes in Aβ+ET1 rats confirmed the histological
observation we had shown using NeuN staining that there
was an exacerbated abnormal pyknotic neuronal morphology with
shrunken cell bodies and surrounding empty spaces, as well as an
apparent decrease in the length of neuronal processes in the rats
with combined insults. This also suggests that the signaling events
occurring within the membrane raft domains, and regulated by Fer
K, might be responsible for neuronal cell death observed in
Aβ+ET1 rats. In addition to neurodegeneration, Fer K also regulates
cytoskeletal organization and membrane-associated receptor
endocytosis (13). Membrane rafts are membrane microdomains
that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol and are thought to be
a clustering point for cellular activity during neurodegeneration
(38) and axonal growth (14).
The Aβ+ET1 rats did not demonstrate any impairment in place
learning in the visual discrimination learning on the radial maze, a
behavioral task that is thought to be mediated via the acquisition of
stimulus–response associations and is sensitive to relatively large,
bilateral lesions in the dorsolateral striatum (26, 27, 32). Interestingly
, Aβ+ET1 rats have shown learning and memory impairment
in discriminative fear-conditioning to context task that is linked to
hippocampal dysfunction (5). These rats have also shown progressive
deterioration in memory and learning with the Barnes circular

maze up to 8 weeks post insult (52). The present investigation did
not show any deficit related to the dorsolateral striatum, suggesting
that the neural machinery necessary for sensory detection and
processing, movement generation, and motivation to drive
behavior was intact in these rats, mainly caused by the unilateral
striatal lesion sparing the contralateral striatum. A further explanation
for the differential behavioral results from these studies is
that perhaps the behavioral effects in these rats are primarily
caused by the dysfunction of prefrontal cortical circuits, in addition
to hippocampus. Support for this possibility comes from a
previous study showing a similar pattern of functional effects on
the discriminative fear-conditioning to context task in rats with
neurotoxic damage to the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex (54).
Rats with damage to this prefrontal region did not show normal
fear responses to the shock vs. the no-shock context but were able
to actively avoid the shock context during the preference test.
In conclusion, our results provide evidence from pathological
changes in the striatum and cortex that may be related to the
mechanisms responsible for the synergistic or overlapping relationship
between a vascular insult such as focal ischemia and
β-amyloid trigger that might lead to full dementia. Our results
suggest that the triggering event is Aβ overproduction, leading to
neuroinflammation, which when combined with ET1-induced glial
activation, can synergistically lead to neuritic retraction and
degeneration of existing neurons in the cortex. This can be compared
and contrasted with the events in the hippocampus in which
glial activation appears to synergistically lead to degeneration of
neurons by reducing the survival of adult-born neurons, possibly
by impairing dendritic development and enhancing axonal retraction
of the immature neurons, eventually resulting in functional
deficits (5). It is not clear if the 21-day injury time point following
ET1 and/or Aβ+ET1 injections represent the maximum degeneration
and thus it will be of interest to assess earlier post injury time
points as well as to elucidate if there is a point of no return that
determines whether a cortical neuron will eventually die. We do
have some insight into this as we have previously shown that the
behavioral deficits in the combined model are progressive when
examined at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post insult. With a relatively complete
characterization of the interaction of ischemia and β-amyloid
toxicity for different brain regions, as well as data indicating that
anti-inflammatories can potentially interrupt this association (51,
53), future experiments can be designed to understand the critical
mechanisms that mediate the interation between inflammation and
increases in endogenous β-amyloid in the hippocampus and
cortex, not only in these models but others including transgenic
models and those with pathology stimulated by β-amyloid-derived
diffussable ligands (ADDLs) [reviewed in (7)].
