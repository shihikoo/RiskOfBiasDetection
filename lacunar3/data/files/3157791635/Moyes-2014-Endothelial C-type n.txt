Introduction
The vascular endothelium releases an array of vasorelaxant 
mediators that not only influence the tone and growth of the 
underlying smooth muscle, but also regulate the reactivity 
of leukocytes and platelets (1, 2). Endothelial dysfunction, a 
reduced capacity of the endothelium to release these cytoprotective
signaling molecules, is a major precipitating factor
in cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke) that accounts for the greatest number 
of deaths in Western societies (3, 4). Perhaps the most important
endothelium-derived paracrine mediators are nitric oxide 
(NO) and prostacyclin (PGI
2
), each well established as playing 
a multifaceted role in vascular homeostasis (1, 5, 6). In many 
arteries, however, particularly those in the resistance vasculature
, substantial endothelium-dependent dilatation persists 
following inhibition of NO and PGI
2
 synthesis. This residual 
non-NO, nonprostanoid vasorelaxant activity is attributed to 
endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH) and is established
as playing a fundamental role in regulating resistance 
artery tone and systemic blood pressure (7). The mechanism 
or mechanisms underpinning EDH remain controversial, but 
it is believed to be more prominent in females than males and 
may contribute to the cardioprotective phenotype experienced 
by premenopausal women when compared with age-matched 
male counterparts (8–10).
In concert with local endothelial production of NO and PGI
2
, 
cardiac-derived atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and 
BNP) possess well-defined endocrine functions in maintaining 
electrolyte balance, blood volume, vascular tone, and cardiac 
integrity (11, 12). The third member of this peptide family, C-type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP), has clearly delineated roles in bone 
growth(13, 14); there is, however, a paucity of evidence supporting 
a physiological role for this peptide in cardiovascular homeostasis. 
Yet the intriguing pharmacodynamic profile of exogenous CNP in 
vascular cells and tissues in vitro (15, 16) coupled with the significant
expression of CNP in endothelial cells (17, 18) intimates that 
it possesses an ideal functional capacity and tissue localization to 
influence vascular dynamics.
Herein, we have developed and characterized a mouse model 
with endothelial-specific deletion of CNP to delineate a role for the 
peptide in vascular homeostasis. Utilizing this unique tool, we reveal 
that CNP is a major component of the non-NO, nonprostanoid 
component of endothelium-dependent relaxation in the resistance 
vasculature (i.e., EDH) and that loss of CNP signaling results in 
vascular dysfunction, hypertension, atherogenesis, and aneurysm. 
Moreover, we identify activation of natriuretic peptide receptor–C 
(NPR-C) as the principal route via which CNP regulates vascular 
tone and integrity and describe the development of small-molecule 
The endothelium plays a fundamental role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by releasing factors that regulate local 
blood flow, systemic blood pressure, and the reactivity of leukocytes and platelets. Accordingly, endothelial dysfunction 
underpins many cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Herein, we evaluated 
mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Nppc, which encodes C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and determined that 
this mediator is essential for multiple aspects of vascular regulation. Specifically, disruption of CNP leads to endothelial 
dysfunction, hypertension, atherogenesis, and aneurysm. Moreover, we identified natriuretic peptide receptor–C (NPR-C) 
as the cognate receptor that primarily underlies CNP-dependent vasoprotective functions and developed small-molecule 
NPR-C agonists to target this pathway. Administration of NPR-C agonists promotes a vasorelaxation of isolated resistance 
arteries and a reduction in blood pressure in wild-type animals that is diminished in mice lacking NPR-C. This work provides 
a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association studies that have linked the NPR-C (Npr3) locus with hypertension 
by demonstrating the importance of CNP/NPR-C signaling in preserving vascular homoeostasis. Furthermore, these results 
suggest that the CNP/NPR-C pathway has potential as a disease-modifying therapeutic target for cardiovascular disorders.

Results
Development and characterization of an endothelium-specific CNP 
knockout mouse. We abrogated CNP expression in endothelial cells 
via a tissue-specific excision of the Nppc gene using Cre-Lox technology
(ref. 19 and Figure 1, A and B). Expression of CNP mRNA 
was significantly reduced (~80%) in microvascular endothelial 
cells isolated from Tie2-Cre Nppcfl/fl mice (hereafter referred to 
as endothelium-specific CNP knockout [ecCNP KO] mice) compared
with WT littermates (Figure 1C). In contrast, CNP mRNA 
expression was equivalent in all other tissues examined from WT 
and KO animals, with the exception of the lungs in which lower 
levels are probably indicative of loss of endothelial CNP from this 
organ. CNP mRNA was also detected at commensurate levels in 
the leukocyte subpopulations from WT and KO mice (indeed, if 
Figure 1. Development and characterization of an endothelium-specific CNP knockout mouse. Cell-specific deletion of the CNP gene was achieved by 
flanking exons 1 and 2 of the CNP (Nppc) gene with LoxP sites (A). Flippase recognition target (FRT) sites were used to permit efficient removal of the 
neomycin cassette by breeding chimeric mice with ubiquitous Flpe-expressing animals, resulting in the generation of Nppc+/fl offspring. Nppc fl/fl animals 
were then crossed with a mouse in which expression of Cre recombinase is driven by an endothelial-specific promoter/enhancer associated with the angiopoietin Tie2 receptor. Heterozygous animals at the Nppc locus that expressed the Tie2 transgene (Tie2-Cre Nppc+/fl) were used as breeding pairs to generate 
ecCNP KO and corresponding WT (Tie2-Cre Nppc+/+) littermate controls. Analysis of the DNA from these animals confirmed generation of the 6 possible 
genotypes (B). qPCR analysis of CNP mRNA from different tissues established that the CNP gene had been deleted selectively from vascular endothelial 
cells (C). Measurement of plasma CNP concentrations under basal conditions and following administration of LPS (12.5 mg/kg; i.p.; 12 h) confirmed that 
peptide levels were significantly reduced in ecCNP KO versus WT animals (D). Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. n = 5. ***P < 0.001, significantly

was apparent whether studies were conducted in the presence 
(Figure 2, B and F) or absence (Supplemental Figure 1, I and J) of 
endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition
(to prevent the production of NO and PGI
2
, respectively). 
These observations establish that endothelium-derived CNP is a 
key component of EDH. Importantly, the aberrant vascular reactivity
in female ecCNP KO mice was due to a loss of endothelial 
function and not a change in smooth muscle responsiveness, since 
relaxant responses to exogenous CNP (Supplemental Figure 2K) 
and the endothelium-independent dilator spermine-NONOate 
(an NO-donor drug; ref. 21 and Supplemental Table 1) were comparable
between WT and ecCNP KO mice.
Impact of endothelial disruption of CNP on blood pressure. Having 
established a functional endothelial deficit in the resistance vasculature
of ecCNP KO mice, we investigated whether this resulted 
in a hypertensive phenotype in vivo. In female ecCNP KO mice, 
the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was significantly higher 
than that of WT littermates (Figure 2, G and H), resulting from 
increases in both systolic (WT: 119.4 ± 0.67 mmHg, ecCNP KO: 
Vascular reactivity in endothelial CNP knockout mice. We 
compared the in vitro vascular reactivity of conduit (aorta) and 
resistance (mesenteric) arteries from WT and ecCNP KO mice. 
Responses to the vasoconstrictors phenylephrine (α

-adrenoceptor 
agonist) and U46619 (thromboxane A
2
 mimetic) were identical in 
vessels taken from WT and ecCNP KO animals regardless of sex 
(Supplemental Figure 1, A–H; supplemental material available 
online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI74281DS1). In the aorta, 
the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (ACh) produced 
concentration-dependent relaxations of both WT and ecCNP KO 
tissues with analogous potency and efficacy, albeit with a small 
reduction in maximal relaxation in the female ecCNP KO mice 
(Figure 2, A and E); these data are in accord with previous work 
establishing that such relaxations are primarily dependent on the 
release of endothelium-derived NO and PGI
2
 (20). In marked contrast
, in mesenteric small arteries, there was a significant rightward 
shift (indicative of decreased potency) in the vasorelaxant concentration-response
curve to ACh in female (Figure 2F), but not male 
(Figure 2B), vessels. This sex-dependent endothelial impairment 
Figure 2. Endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in ecCNP KO mice. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh in isolated aorta and mesenteric artery 
of male ecCNP KO animals was unaltered in comparison with that of littermate controls (A and B). In contrast, there was a small reduction in maximal ACh 
relaxation in the aorta (E) and significant decrease in potency to ACh in the mesenteric arteries (F) of female ecCNP KO animals. MABP of male (C and D) 
and female (G and H) WT and ecCNP KO animals paralleled the in vitro vascular reactivity with a hypertensive phenotype only apparent in females; heterozygous
ecCNP animals exhibited an intermediate phenotype (H). An analogous endothelial dysfunction (J) and hypertensive phenotype (K) was apparent 
in female NPR-C KO animals, whereas male NPR-C KO mice maintained normal endothelial function (I) and exhibited a mild hypotensive phenotype (K). 
CNP relaxed human mesenteric resistance arteries in a concentration-dependent manner and was sensitive to the NPR-C antagonist M372049 and high

NPR-C, a GPCR (23). Our previous work has provided evidence 
that exogenous CNP mediates vasorelaxation in resistance arteries
via NPR-C and activation of a G-protein gated inwardly rectifying
potassium channel (GIRK) (24, 25). In order to delineate the 
receptor that CNP triggers to maintain vascular homeostasis, we 
examined mesenteric vascular function and blood pressure in Npr3
KO (NPR-C KO) mice. Here, the loss of responsiveness to ACh 
observed in ecCNP KO animals was recapitulated (Figure 2, I and 
J), with endothelial dysfunction observed in vessels from female, 
but not male, NPR-C KO mice. In accord with this sex difference 
in vascular function, female NPR-C animals exhibited a hypertensive
phenotype whereas male NPR-C KO mice did not (Figure 2K). 
Indeed, male NPR-C KO animals had a marginally reduced blood 
pressure, as described previously (26), which corresponds to the 
conventional clearance function of NPR-C to remove natriuretic 
peptides from the circulation (26, 27). Further evidence supporting
a role for NPR-C as the principal receptor triggered by endothelial
CNP to elicit vasodilation and lower MABP was gleaned from 
experiments using exogenous CNP. The vasorelaxant activity of 
CNP was blunted in mesenteric vessels from NPR-C KO animals 
129.1 ± 0.82 mmHg, P < 0.001, n = 8) and diastolic pressure (WT: 
90.2 ± 0.48 mmHg, ecCNP KO: 104.4 ± 0.83 mmHg, P < 0.001, 
n = 8). There was no significant difference in heart rate, although 
heart rate variability (HRV), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease 
(22), was increased in ecCNP KO animals (Supplemental Table 2). 
The hypertensive phenotype was evident both day and night, but 
without any overt effect on the circadian rhythm. Heterozygous 
animals with one Nppc allele deleted (Tie2-Cre Nppc+/fl ) exhibited an 
intermediate blood pressure phenotype (Figure 2H), establishing 
haploinsufficiency at the Nppc locus. The sex disparity in endothelial
dysfunction observed in vitro was translated to the physiological 
setting, since MABP was not significantly raised in males (Figure 2, 
C and D). Thus, the analogous sex-dependent in vitro vascular dysfunction
and raised blood pressure in vivo provide evidence that it 
is the loss of endothelial function at a local level that underpins the 
systemic abnormality; more specifically, endothelial CNP deficiency
results in impaired vascular homeostasis.
Functional role of NPR-C in maintaining blood pressure. In mammals
, the biological activity of CNP is reliant on binding to 1 of 2 
cognate receptors: NPR-B, a guanylate cyclase-coupled protein, or

that CNP regulates platelet function (and leukocyte recruitment) via inhibition of P-selectin expression. Endothelial P-selectin expression was also significantly
greater in the aorta of ecCNP KO versus WT mice (K and L). Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. n = 10 for leukocyte studies; n = 6 for platelet

lium-derived CNP on leukocyte and platelet reactivity. Leukocyte 
recruitment is a sequential, multistep process involving rolling, 
adhesion, and migration of cells orchestrated by a number of adhesion
molecules expressed on both leukocytes and endothelial cells 
and chemokines that direct cells to the site of infection or injury 
along a concentration gradient (41). In mesenteric postcapillary 
venules of ecCNP KO, basal leukocyte rolling (an index of leukocyte
recruitment) was almost double that observed in WT littermates
(Figure 3, A, B, and F; representative observations from WT 
and ecCNP KO animals, respectively, are shown in Supplemental 
Videos 1 and 2). These data imply that endothelium-derived CNP 
maintains a resting antileukocyte influence on the vascular wall. 
The hyperreactivity of leukocytes in ecCNP KO mice was further 
illustrated in animals administered the inflammogen IL-1β (Figure 
3B). The heterozygous animals displayed an intermediate phenotype
in terms of leukocyte rolling under both basal and inflammatory
conditions (Figure 3, A and B). There was no significant 
difference between erythrocyte velocity and wall shear rates in 
vessels from WT and ecCNP KO animals (Supplemental Table 
3), confirming that the changes observed were not the result of 
alterations in vessel diameter or blood flow. This apparent antiinflammatory
role for endothelium-derived CNP was substantiat -
(Supplemental Figure 1K), and in accord, the hypotensive response 
to CNP in vivo was also diminished in NPR-C KO mice (Figure 6I). 
Since previous work has demonstrated that NPR-B KO animals are 
normotensive (28), these observations as a whole provide convincing
evidence that, physiologically, NPR-C is the primary receptor 
triggered by CNP to maintain vascular function and blood pressure.
The thesis is supported by the acute vasodilator (29, 30) and 
hypotensive (31–34) responses to exogenous CNP and the emerging
signaling role of G
i
-coupled NPR-C in various cell types (35–39).
CNP also produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of 
human vessels that was abolished in the presence of the selective 
NPR-C antagonist M372049 (lead compound based on AP-811; 
gift of C. Veale, AstraZeneca) (25, 40) and following precontraction
mediated by high K+ (which abrogates smooth muscle 
hyperpolarization; Figure 2L). These data confirm that an NPRC
–triggered hyperpolarization is responsible for the vasorelaxant 
activity of CNP in human resistance arteries and provide proof-ofconcept
that the signaling pathway we have identified is functionally
important in the human cardiovascular system.
The role of CNP in leukocytes and platelets. Having established 
CNP as a pivotal physiological regulator of vascular tone and 
blood pressure, we probed the functional significance of endothe -

ed using a peritonitis model. Following administration of TNF-α, 
the accumulation of neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages 
in the peritoneum was significantly greater in ecCNP KO animals 
versus WT littermates; a similar increase was observed in myeloperoxidase
(MPO) activity (an index of neutrophil activation; 
Supplemental Figure 2). Importantly, in contrast to the blood 
pressure phenotype, there was no sex difference observed in leukocyte
recruitment (data are a composite of observations from 
male and female mice). Further studies revealed that similar 
increases in leukocyte rolling were observed in NPR-C KO mice 
(Figure 3, C and D), suggesting that an identical signal-transduction
system that underpins the hypotensive effect of CNP is also 
responsible for the peptide’s antileukocyte activity.
Additional investigation provided strong evidence that 
endothelium-derived CNP also exerts an antiplatelet influence. 
In whole blood, we show that platelet aggregation in response to 
collagen and the thrombin mimetic protease activated receptor-4 
activating peptide (PAR4-AP) is exacerbated in ecCNP KO mice 
(Figure 3G). Akin to leukocyte reactivity, there was no sex difference
in this antiplatelet effect of CNP (data are a composite of 
observations from male and female mice). Flow cytometry was 
employed to garner insight into the mechanism or mechanisms 
underpinning the antiplatelet effect of endothelium-derived CNP. 
These studies illustrated 2 key points. First, platelet P-selectin 
expression was significantly elevated under basal conditions and 
following addition of PAR4-AP in ecCNP KO mice compared with 
WT littermates (Figure 3, H and I). Second, ecCNP KO mice have 
a significantly greater number of circulating platelet-leukocyte 
aggregates in comparison with WT animals (Figure 3J). Both 
are recognized indices of platelet reactivity and cardiovascular 
inflammation (42, 43) and suggest that endothelium-derived CNP 
maintains a subtle, yet important dampening of platelet function 
in vivo. Moreover, a similar increase in P-selectin expression was 
observed on endothelial cells (Figure 3, K and L). The prominence 
of P-selectin in leukocyte extravasation and platelet-endothelium/
platelet-leukocyte interactions (44) suggests that an NPR-C–driven
suppression of P-selectin expression is a common mechanism 
underpinning the antileukocyte and antiplatelet effects of CNP.
CNP influences atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. In light 
of the observation above, we hypothesized that ecCNP KO mice 
would exhibit increased susceptibility to atheroma formation. To 
address this, we exploited a well-validated experimental model 
of atherogenesis, the apolipoprotein E (Apoe) KO mouse (45, 46). 
The development of atherosclerotic plaque in the aorta of ecCNP/
ApoE double KO (dKO) mice was significantly accelerated when 
compared with the corresponding CNP WT/ApoE KO littermates. 
This manifested as considerably greater plaque area throughout 
the entire aorta, with the most notable increases in the aortic 
arch and the suprarenal region of the abdominal aorta (Figure 4, 
A–E). Furthermore, cross-sectional analysis of the brachiocephalic
artery revealed that plaque intrusion into the vessel lumen 
and the development of a neointimal layer characterized by vascular
smooth muscle hyperplasia were significantly greater in the 
ecCNP/ApoE dKO mice (Figure 4, F–H). This increased plaque 
burden was also accompanied by an increased infiltration of 
smooth muscle cells and macrophages into the lesions (Figure 4, I

ApoE dKO mice was not a result of altered plasma lipid profile or 
circulating cell numbers/subpopulations, since these parameters 
were not significantly different between the 2 genotypes (Supple -

was apparent (data are a composite of observations from male and

a consequence of hypertension, since both male ecCNP KO and

precipitates endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, augments 
inflammatory cell and platelet activation, and accelerates the 
development of atherogenesis and aneurysm. Furthermore, we 
establish NPR-C as the cognate receptor that conveys the vasoprotective
bioactivity of CNP and describe the design and development
of small molecule NPR-C agonists that recapitulate the beneficial
actions of CNP signaling in the vasculature.
This newly defined blood pressure regulatory role of endothe -
lium-derived CNP, and specifically recognition of the involvement 
of NPR-C, provides a mechanism to explain our recent GWAS that 
identified and validated association of the NPR-C (Npr3) gene 
locus with blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
(49). Furthermore, our data explain other reported genetic associations
linking the CNP (Nppc), NPR-C (Npr3), and furin (a proprotein
convertase important in the processing of proCNP; ref. 50) loci 
to hypertension (49, 51–53). However, our findings are consistent 
with a dual capacity of NPR-C to act as a clearance receptor and 
a positive signaling mechanism responsive to endothelial CNP. 
The blood pressure difference between male NPR-C KO mice 
(7 mmHg lower than WT) and female NPR-C KO mice (7 mmHg 
higher than WT) is equivalent to the hypertension observed in 
female ecCNP KO mice (14 mmHg higher than WT), implying that 
deletion of NPR-C causes a small reduction in blood pressure in 
both sexes (consistent with a clearance function; ref. 26), which is 
counterbalanced by the loss of CNP/NPR-C signaling in females, 
resulting in an overall hypertensive phenotype. It remains to be 
elucidated whether individual receptors can both clear and signal 
or whether there are subpopulations that possess one or the other 
function. This differential activity might be cell-type dependent; 
for example, NPR-C expressed on endothelial cells would be more 
suited to clearing natriuretic peptides from the circulation, while 
NPR-C expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells may be config -
ured to signal in response to endothelial CNP. Reports suggest that 
multiple NPR-C proteins exist with varying molecular weights and 
susceptibility to internalization (54), giving rise to the possibility 
that splice variants or posttranslational modification may influence
function (i.e., clearance versus signaling). Further investigation
is required to delineate whether polymorphisms within the 
Npr3 gene functionally alter clearance, signaling, or both.
The current study also reveals a sex difference in the conse -
quences of endothelial deletion of CNP on blood pressure control.
This observation parallels data gleaned from our previous 
work utilizing mice doubly deficient in eNOS and COX-1 (9), 
and explains the mechanism by which females maintain normal 
blood pressure (i.e., via CNP release), whereas males are more 
reliant on endothelium-derived NO; such a sex difference has 
been suggested to underpin, in part, the lower incidence of cardiovascular
disease in premenopausal women compared with 
age-matched male counterparts (8, 10). Whether a sex difference 
in CNP/NPR-C signaling is apparent in the human vasculature 
remains to be determined. This study identified a functional 
CNP/NPR-C signaling pathway in isolated human resistance 
arteries (i.e., equivalent vasorelaxant responses to CNP) in 
males and females, and our GWAS linking NPR-C genotype with 
hypertension (49) did not reveal a sex disparity. Such observations
intimate that, in humans, both sexes signal via NPR-C to 
maintain blood pressure. However, the propensity of female sex 
ecCNP/ApoE dKO mice were normotensive and female ecCNP 
KO and ecCNP/ApoE dKO mice had a commensurate higher 
MABP (Supplemental Table 6).
Unexpectedly, the ecCNP/ApoE dKO mice also developed 
aneurysms (Figure 5, A–D). This phenomenon was only observed 
in male mice, where approximately 50% (4/9) developed either 
aortic arch or abdominal aneurysms; since the male ecCNP KO 
mice did not exhibit a hypertensive phenotype, this effect is not 
pressure related. The morphological changes in the aortic wall 
were characterized by wall thinning (medial degeneration) and 
dilatation (aortic arch) and complete disruption of the internal 
elastic laminae (abdominal aorta), resulting in protrusion of the 
atheroma into the adventitia.
The effect of novel, small-molecule NPR-C agonists on vascular
reactivity and blood pressure. Consistent with this multimodal 
cytoprotective profile of CNP in the vasculature, we proceeded 
to develop small-molecule NPR-C agonists based on the premise 
that activation of NPR-C would recapitulate the beneficial bioactivity
of CNP. The lead molecules (design and synthesis of which 
will be described elsewhere), exemplified by compound 118 and 
related structures (Figure 6A), were discovered as a result of a systematic
design program that identified key binding features of the 
natural ligand CNP and the peptide antagonist M372049 ascertained
from the published crystal structure of NPR-C (47). In silico 
screening of virtual compound libraries was employed to select 
compounds with optimal predicted binding characteristics and 
drug-like properties; these were synthesized in house, and rapid 
evaluation of the potency of these molecules was assessed using 
a cell-based screening assay (Figure 6, B–D). The tert-butyl glycine
ester (compound 28) and its corresponding acid (compound 
118) showed potent activity. Amino acids with sterically bulky side 
chains such as valine (e.g., compounds 63 and 119; Figure 6A) 
showed lower activity. The bromine atom contributed to activity, 
and removal, as in compound 88, also diminished potency. Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy was used to confirm 
binding of endogenous ligand CNP, the selective receptor antagonist
M372049, and compound 118 to human NPR-C (Figure 6, 
E–G). The physicochemical properties of 118 fall within general 
guidelines for drug likeness (48) and also have good in vitro and 
in vivo potency (Figure 6, H and I). For example, 118 causes relaxation
of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries with an EC
50
 value 
of approximately 3 μM (Figure 6H), an effect blocked by NPR-C 
antagonism (Supplemental Figure 1L). Moreover, 118 causes dosedependent
reductions in blood pressure in anesthetized WT mice 
(ED
50
 < 1 mg/kg), which is significantly blunted in NPR-C KO animals
(Figure 6I), demonstrating receptor selectivity.
Discussion
Endothelium-derived NO and PGI
2
 are recognized as playing vascular
homeostatic roles (1, 5, 6). Herein, using complementary 
genetic and pharmacological approaches, we provide evidence 
that endothelium-derived CNP represents an additional physiological
regulator of vascular reactivity and integrity, governing 
smooth muscle tone, systemic blood pressure, and the activation 
of circulating leukocytes and platelets. This role appears equivalent
in prominence to that of PGI
2
 and NO, with a comparable 
diverse functional remit. In accord, disruption of CNP signaling

sive actions of lead NPR-C agonists are observed in males and 
females, indicating that the NPR-C signaling pathway is amenable
to pharmacological manipulation in both sexes. As such, 
NPR-C agonists have potential as disease-modifying therapeutics
for hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.
Methods
Generation of an ecCNP KO mouse
This was achieved using a targeting vector constructed with 2 LoxP 
sites flanking the entire peptide coding region for CNP in exons 
1 and 2 (Figure 1A). Nppcfl/fl animals, which had been backcrossed at 
least 10 times to a C57BL/6J background, were crossed with a mouse 
in which expression of Cre recombinase is driven by an endothelialspecific
promoter/enhancer associated with the angiopoietin Tie 2
receptor (72). Heterozygous animals at the Nppc locus that expressed 
the Tie2 transgene (Tie2-Cre Nppc+/fl ) were used as breeding pairs to 
generate ecCNP KO and corresponding WT (Tie2-Cre Nppc+/+) littermate
controls (Figure 1B). Offspring were produced according to 
Mendelian inheritance laws, and ecCNP KO mice gained weight at 
an equivalent rate to that of WT littermates, suggesting loss of endothelial
CNP does not have any overt effect on development in utero 
or postpartum (data not shown).
In some studies, Tie2-Cre Nppcfl/fl mice were crossed with Apoe KO 
mice (both C57BL/K6 background), and the Tie2-Cre Nppc+/fl Apoe+/–
offspring recrossed to obtain Tie 2-Cre Nppc+/fl Apoe KO animals. These 
were used as breeding pairs to generate Tie2-Cre Nppc+/+ Apoe KO (WT/
Apoe KO) and Tie2-Cre Nppcfl/fl Apoe KO (ecCNP/ApoE dKO) mice. 
From 5 weeks of age, animals were fed a high-fat (21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol
; Lillico Biotechnology) Western style diet for 12 weeks.
Genotyping and qPCR analysis
Genomic DNA was prepared from ear biopsies for analysis by PCR using 
standard cycling parameters. The floxed allele was detected using the following
primers: 5′-CCTTTATGCCAAGAGAACTTCCAGGAGG-3′ and 
5′-TCCTTCCTGACTTCCTTCTGCTCTCTATCC-3′. These flank the 
second loxP site (Figure 1A), amplifying 842-bp (WT) and 956-bp (floxed) 
products. The primers used for the detection of the Tie2-Cre transgene 
were 5′-CCTGTGCTCAGACAGAAATGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCATAACCAGTGAAACAGCATTGC-3′ (550 bp).
Total RNA was extracted (QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit) from endothelial
cells, lung, liver, and kidney of ecCNP WT and KO animals to 
confirm selective deletion of CNP from the endothelium. Pulmonary 
microvascular endothelial cells were isolated as we described previously
(56). 1 μg RNA was converted to cDNA using the QIAGEN Quantitect
Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Quantitative real-time 
PCR was performed using the Quantitect SYBR green kit (QIAGEN) 
with primers designed to detect CNP exon 2 (10 μM; 5′-CTGCACTAACATCCCAGACC-3′ and 5′-CTGGTGGCAATCAGAAAAAG-3′). 
Results were analyzed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT software package 
SDS 2.1 (Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd). Relative Cnp mRNA expression
was determined using the 2–ΔΔCt method. mRNA levels were normalized
to 18S (internal control) for each sample, and gene expression
was quantified as a fold change relative to ecCNP WT levels.
To determine CNP expression in specific circulating cell popula -
tions, 50 μl of whole blood diluted 1:1 with HEPES buffer was incubated
with antibodies selective for mouse neutrophils (GR-1 FITC; 
hormones to maintain higher natriuretic peptide levels (55) suggests
that women, akin to mice, may place a greater reliance on 
endothelial CNP to regulate vascular homeostasis.
In addition to the maintenance of vascular dynamics and blood 
pressure, our data reveal that endothelium-derived CNP plays a 
role in preserving the integrity of the blood vessel wall; this is manifested
in the ecCNP KO mouse as accelerated atherogenesis and 
aneurysm. This structural role for CNP is likely to stem from both 
direct and indirect salutary actions. The functional capacity of 
endothelium-derived CNP, delineated herein, in regulating vessel 
tone and the reactivity of leukocytes and platelets coupled to the 
peptide’s ability to augment endothelial cell growth while inhibiting
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (56) will undoubtedly
contribute to offsetting the development of athero sclerotic 
lesions. However, a further direct effect on the blood vessel wall 
is likely. One common mechanism underpinning the development
of atherosclerosis and aneurysm is the activation of MMPs, 
particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9 (57–59). This may be a key point 
of intervention of endothelium-derived CNP, since in chondrocytes
, CNP overexpression reverses achondroplasia by reducing 
the activity and release of several MMPs, including both MMP-2 
and MMP-9 (60), and CNP regulates the MMP/tissue inhibitors 
of metalloproteinases (TIMP) ratio to ameliorate renal fibrosis following
ureteral obstruction (61). Our work might therefore explain 
the beneficial activity of neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, which 
prevent the endogenous breakdown of CNP (and other natriuretic 
peptides), in experimental models of atherosclerosis (62). This 
thesis is supported by observations in diseased human coronary 
arteries that expression of CNP is inversely correlated with severity
of the lesion (63) and that CNP is a particularly potent inhibitor 
of oxidized LDL–stimulated vascular smooth muscle migration 
and mitogenesis, an integral component of complex lesion formation
(64–66). Moreover, in many experimental models, pressor 
agents such as Angiotensin II are necessary to trigger the formation
of aneurysm (67); ecCNP KO mice may offer a cleaner model 
with which to study this vascular disorder and shed light on the sex 
bias apparent in humans (68).
The identification of small-molecule agonists at NPR-C 
represents an excellent starting point for the development of 
drugs likely to exert multiple, beneficial effects in the cardio -
vascular system, although it remains to be established whether 
such compounds would recapitulate all of the cytoprotective 
functions of endothelium-derived CNP identified in this study. 
Regardless, these molecules confirm the “druggable” nature 
of NPR-C and have wider implications for the rationale design 
and development of small-molecule agonists targeted to large 
(in this case dimeric) GPCRs with endogenous peptide ligands, 
which has proven difficult to date (69–71). With respect to NPRC
, the lead molecules we have identified (particularly those 
that exhibit high affinity/slow dissociation) not only possess the 
potential to exert the plethora of vasoprotective effects verified 
above, but should also slow the removal of endogenous natriuretic
peptides from the circulation by effectively competing for 
the “clearance” function of NPR-C (a mechanism for removal 
of natriuretic peptides from the circulation) (27); thus, the cardioprotective
actions of endogenous natriuretic peptides will 
also be enhanced. Moreover, the vasorelaxant and hypoten-

bead homogenizer for 30 s at 2,000 g. Samples were then centrifuged 
for 5 minutes at 10,000 g and the supernatant removed for use in the 
assay. Mesenteric samples were diluted 1:2 in HTAB for analysis. 20 μl 
of standard (MPO 0.03 U/ml–1 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and samples (duplicate
) were added to a 96-well plate. 160 μl tetramethylbenzidine was 
added to each well, followed by 20 μl H

 (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated 
for 5 minutes at room temperature (protected from light). The absorbance 
was read on a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. The protein content of each 
sample was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific
) performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometry
Whole blood was subjected to flow cytometric analysis to assess 
platelet P-selectin expression and platelet-leukocyte interactions. 
For P-selectin expression, 5 μl of citrated blood diluted 1:10 with 
HEPES buffer (composition: 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO
4
, 
10 mM HEPES) was incubated with anti-mouse CD41-PE (glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa; 1:200; clone eBioMWreg30; eBioscience) and antimouse
CD62P-FITC (P-selectin; 1:200; clone RB40.34; BD Biosciences
) for 30 minutes prior to analysis (FACScalibur; BD). The results 
are expressed as the percentage of platelets (CD41-positive cells) 
expressing the adhesion molecule P-selectin. The number of circulating
platelet-leukocyte aggregates was determined by staining 50 μl 
blood (diluted 1:1 with HEPES buffer) with anti-mouse CD45-FITC 
(leukocyte common antigen; 1:200; clone 30-F11; eBioscience) and 
anti-mouse CD41-PE for 30 minutes prior to the addition of red blood 
cell lysis buffer (BD Biosciences). The results were expressed as the 
percentage of double-positive cells within the leukocyte population.
Characterization of atherosclerotic lesions
Animals were perfused with saline via the left ventricle, followed by 
4% formaldehyde in aqueous buffered solution at physiological pressure
to fix the vascular tree. The entire aorta was removed and opened 
longitudinally from the aortic root to the iliac bifurcation. Atherosclerotic
lesions were stained with oil red O, as previously described 
(75). Images of en face staining were captured using a digital camera 
(Nikon D70), and the total area covered by plaque was quantified 
using Image Pro software. Brachiocephalic arteries from the same 
mice were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned, and stained with 
H&E, anti–smooth muscle actin (1:400; clone 1A4; Sigma-Aldrich), 
and anti-Mac2 (1:6000; clone M3/38; Cedarlane). The intima-media 
thickness ratio and plaque size were analyzed using Axiovision 4.8.2 
software. Cross sections of the aneurysms were stained with Elastic 
Van Gieson and anti–smooth muscle actin. Fasting plasma lipid levels 
were measured using a commercially available kit (Abcam).
Plasma CNP measurement
Plasma CNP was extracted (C18 columns) and measured using a commercially
available ELISA kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals).
NPR-C agonist screening assays
Ca2+ flux in rat mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells in response to 
angiotensin II. Measurements of Ca2+ flux in response to angiotensin 
II were conducted using a fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR; 
Molecular Devices). Mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells isolated 
by collagenase digestion were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well 
into black, clear-bottomed 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented 
1:2500; clone RB6-8C5; eBioscience), monocytes (CD115 APC; 
1:400; clone AFS98; eBioscience), T cells (CD3e PE Cy7; 1:100; clone 
145-2C11; eBioscience) and B cells (CD19 Br Viol; 1:100; clone 6D5; 
BioLegend) for 30 minutes and cell populations sorted (ARIA II; BD). 
Total RNA was isolated from each cell type, and 200 ng of RNA was 
reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR analysis using the same 
primers and PCR conditions as above.
In vitro functional assessment of vessel reactivity
Murine arteries. The vascular reactivity of mouse thoracic aortic and 
mesenteric arterial vascular ring preparations was determined using 
classical tissue bath pharmacology, as we have described previously (9).
Human resistance arteries. Resistance arteries (200–500 μm) 
were isolated from omental fat obtained from patients (14 subjects, 
6 female, mean age 4.4 ± 0.7 years) undergoing nonurgent, nonseptic
abdominal surgery. The reactivity of arterial ring segments 
(2 mm long) was studied as described for the murine mesenteric 
arteries (above).
Radiotelemetric recording of hemodynamics and HRV in vivo
Blood pressure was recorded in conscious, freely moving mice using 
radiotelemetric transmitters (TA11PA-C10; Data Sciences International
) implanted into the aortic arch. After 10 days recovery, the 
blood pressure was recorded for 24 hours in mice left undisturbed and 
maintained on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. Data were acquired 
for 2 minutes every 15 minutes, and the average values for MABP were 
calculated for every time point (Dataquest Art Acquisition System). 
HRV was analyzed in both frequency and time domains using standard
HRV parameters (73) using the HRV extension module of Chart 
4.0 (ADInstruments).
Leukocyte and platelet reactivity
Leukocyte recruitment was assessed in mesenteric postcapillary 
venules, as we have described previously (74).
Impedance aggregometry (Multiplate Dynabyte) was used to 
measure platelet reactivity in whole blood immediately after collection.
175 μl citrated blood diluted 1:1 vol/vol with 0.9% NaCl + 0.025 
mmol/l CaCl
2
 was equilibrated in the test cuvette for 3 minutes prior to 
the addition of collagen (3 and 10 μg/ml; Lab-Medics) or the thrombin 
receptor agonist PAR4-AP (300 μM; Sigma-Aldrich). Aggregation was 
monitored for 6 minutes and expressed as area under the curve.
Experimental peritonitis
Peritonitis was induced by subcutaneous injection of 300 ng TNF-α (Peprotech
). After 4 hours, a peritoneal lavage was performed with 4 ml PBS, 
and the total leukocyte count in the lavage fluid was determined using a 
hemocytometer. In order to determine the cell types in the lavage fluid, 
5 × 105 cells were incubated with antibodies selective for mouse neutrophils
(GR-1 FITC; 20 ng; eBioscience) and inflammatory macrophages 
(double positive for GR-1 FITC and F4/80;125 ng; eBioscience) for 30 
minutes prior to analysis on a flow cytometer (FACScalibur; BD). Data 
were collected from 10,000 events, and the total number of neutrophils 
and inflammatory macrophages in the lavage fluid was calculated using 
the percentage of positive cells measured in the flow cytometry sample.
An MPO assay was performed as second index of neutrophil accumulation.
Mesenteric tissue was homogenized with 1 ml 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (HTAB) in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) using a

drug giving a half-maximal response (pEC
50
) used to compare 
potency. Curves were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA with repeated 
measures. For in vivo studies, changes in MABP, leukocyte flux, and 
platelet reactivity were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni 
post-test where appropriate. Differences in atherosclerotic lesion size 
were analyzed by 2-tailed Student’s t test. Normal distribution of data 
was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of n animals.

with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine 
(2 mM), and 10% heat inactivated New Zealand fetal calf serum. 24 
hours later the cells were incubated with Fluo-3-AM (4 μM) for 60 
minutes at 37°C. Once dye loaded, the cells were washed thoroughly 
with the proprietary assay buffer to remove any unincorporated dye. 
The cells were then incubated with NPR-C agonists, CNP, or vehicle 
(DMSO) and placed into the FLIPR. After 15 minutes, angiotensin II 
(100 nM) was automatically dispensed into each well and the fluorescence
signal followed for 5 minutes. Potency was determined by comparison
of the peak fluorescence in each test well (run in triplicate) 
with that of the control (angiotensin II alone). Background fluorescence
(assay buffer only) was subtracted from all values.
SPR spectroscopy. All SPR analysis was performed on a BIAcore 
T200 system using series S CM5 sensor chips. Data processing and 
analysis were performed using BIAevaluation software and Scrubber2.
All sensorgrams were double referenced by subtracting the 
response on a reference flow cell and a blank sample. Human NPR-C 
(OriGene) was covalently attached to a CM5 chip via amine coupling. 
A surface density of 2700 RU (~3.24 ng NPR-C protein) was used 
for measurements with natriuretic peptides and the NPR-C antagonist
M372049, and a density of 5200 RU (~6.24 ng NPR-C protein) 
for measurements with compound 118. Sequential injections of CNP 
(0.25–4 nM) were performed at a flow rate of 30 μ l/min (240 s for 
each), followed by a dissociation time of 3600 s. Binding site saturation
was observed, and the surface was regenerated by 2 injections 
of 1 M NaCl (200 s each). Binding of M372049 (0.94–60 nM) and 
compound 118 (1.17–150 μM) was analyzed by sequential injections 
(120 s for M372049, 30 s for compound 118) followed by undisturbed 
dissociation (600 s for M372049, 30s for compound 118), during 
which curves returned to baseline. Kinetic parameters were calculated
assuming a simple 1:1 (Langmuir) binding.
