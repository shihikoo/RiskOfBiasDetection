Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an 
archetypal small vessel disease of the brain caused by dominant
mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor. Cardinal vascular 
lesions include deposition of granular osmiophilic material 
within the basal lamina of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), progressive
SMC loss, and fibrosis of the media. Brain pathology 
involves white matter degeneration, lacunar infarcts, and, ultimately
, brain atrophy.1
NOTCH3 receptor is predominantly expressed in SMCs of 
small arteries and pericytes of brain capillaries. Mouse studies 
have demonstrated a critical role of NOTCH3 in brain artery 
morphogenesis and maturation during development. Specifically, 
mice completely lacking NOTCH3 exhibit major structural and 
functional arterial defects and are more susceptible to ischemic 
brain injury.2 On ligand binding, NOTCH3 undergoes a series 
of proteolytic cleavages that ultimately enable its intracellular 
domain to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to the 
transcription factor recombining binding protein suppressor 
of hairless (RBPJ) to activate transcription of genes.3
CADASIL mutations stereotypically lead to an uneven 
number of cysteine residues in 1 of the 34 epidermal growth 
factor repeats constituting the NOTCH3 extracellular domain 
(Notch3ECD). This promotes the abnormal accumulation of 
Background and Purpose—Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy, 
the most common heritable small vessel disease of the brain, is caused by dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor 
that stereotypically lead to age-dependent Notch3ECD deposition in the vessels. NOTCH3 loss of function has been 
demonstrated for few mutations. However, whether this finding applies to all mutations and whether a loss-of-function 
mechanism drives the manifestations of the disease remain yet unknown. This study investigated the in vivo functionality 
of the Arg169Cys archetypal mutation.
Methods—We used mice with constitutive or conditional reduction of NOTCH3 activity, mice harboring the Arg169Cys 
mutation at the endogenous Notch3 locus (Notch3Arg170Cys), and mice overexpressing the Arg169Cys NOTCH3 mutant 
(TgPAC-Notch3R169C) on either a Notch3 wild-type or a null background. NOTCH3 activity was monitored in the brain 
arteries by measuring the expression of NOTCH3 target genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Notch3ECD
deposits were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Brain parenchyma was analyzed for vacuolation and myelin debris in 
the white matter and infarcts.
Results—We identified a subset of genes appropriate to detect NOTCH3 haploinsufficiency in the adult. Expression of these 
genes was unaltered in Notch3Arg170Cys mice, despite marked Notch3ECD deposits. Elimination of wild-type NOTCH3 did 
not influence the onset and burden of white matter lesions in 20-month-old TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice, and 20-month-old 
Notch3-null mice exhibited neither infarct nor white matter changes.
Conclusions—These data provide strong evidence that cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts 
and leucoencephalopathy can develop without impairment of NOTCH3 signaling and argue against a loss of NOTCH3 
function as a general driving mechanism for white matter lesions in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with 
subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy. (Stroke. 2014;45:842-849.)

Cognat et al Functionality of the Arg169Cys CADASIL Mutation 843
mutant Notch3ECD at the plasma membrane of SMCs and in the 
granular osmiophilic material.4–6 Our recent work highlighted 
that aggregation/accumulation of Notch3ECD in the brain vessels
is an early event, promoting the abnormal recruitment of 
functionally important extracellular matrix proteins that may 
ultimately cause multifactorial toxicity.6
Although few mutations located in the ligand-binding 
domain of NOTCH3 (ie, epidermal growth factor repeats 
10–11) unambiguously result in abolished NOTCH3 signaling 
and function, the lack of appropriate tools to directly assess 
the consequence of mutations on NOTCH3 transcriptional 
activity, in vivo, in the brain arteries has frustrated definitive
resolution of this issue for the most prevalent mutations. 
On the one hand, normal surface expression, ligand binding, 
and signaling have been documented for several CADASIL-
associated NOTCH3 mutations, although in vitro. Also, the 
Arg90Cys mutant receptor was shown to efficiently rescue 
the arterial defects of Notch3 KO mice.7–10 On the other hand, 
functional characterization of the human Arg1031Cys mutation
has fueled proposals that CADASIL mutations may initially
behave as wild-type or weak hypomorph alleles and 
acquire loss-of-function properties with aging.11 Hence, notwithstanding
the toxic gain-of-function properties of mutant 
NOTCH3, this raises the 2 following fundamental questions: 
(1) Do all the CADASIL mutants, in the end, consistently 
result in reduced NOTCH3 activity in the brain arteries? (2) 
Does a loss of essential NOTCH3 function contribute to the 
phenotypic manifestations of CADASIL?
The Arg169Cys mutation is a highly prevalent human mutation
associated with a typical CADASIL phenotype.12 In this 
study, we tested the hypothesis that this archetypal mutation, 
which retains normal surface expression, ligand binding, and 
signaling in vitro,13,14 acquires, with aging, loss-of-function
properties that drive the brain manifestations. To achieve 
this, we used mouse models with reduced NOTCH3-RBPJ 
activity and mouse models for human NOTCH3 Arg169Cys 
mutation (corresponding to Arg170Cys and Arg171Cys 
mutation in mouse and rat NOTCH3, respectively) and conducted
molecular analyses of the brain arteries as well as 
neuropathological studies. Together, the data argue against 
a critical contribution of a loss of NOTCH3 function in the 
pathogenesis of CADASIL.
Materials and Methods
Mice
The following lines Rbpjflox/flox (C57BL/6J),15 SMMHC-CreERT2
(C57BL/6J),16 Notch3−/− (C57Bl/6),17 Notch3Arg170Cys mice (genetic
background overall 50% 129EvSv:50% Swiss),14 and 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C (FVB/N)18 have been described previously.
Mice lacking RBPJ in SMC in the adult were generated by breeding Rbpjflox/flox with SMMHC-CreERT2 mice. SMMHC-CreERT2,Rbpjflox/flox
mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of 100 µL of tamoxifen 
(1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO) dissolved in sunflower oil at 
10 weeks of age for 5 consecutive days. SMMHC-CreERT2,Rbpjflox/flox
mice injected with oil served as controls. SMMHC-CreERT2 mice 
crossed with Rosa26-Stopfl-LacZ reporter mice19 were used to monitor
tamoxifen-induced Cre/Lox recombination (Figure IA–IC in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
To generate TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3−/− mice, we first 
crossed TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice with Notch3−/− mice. F1 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/− mice were subsequently mated with 
Notch3−/− mice for 2 generations to obtain F3 mice. The mice used 
in the study, TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/+; TgPAC-Notch3R169C, 
Notch3−/−; nonTg, Notch3+/+, and nonTg,Notch3−/−, were littermates
obtained from the F3 cross. The genetic background of all 
mice used in the study was in the same hybrid background of 88% 
C57Bl/6:12% FVB/N overall.
All mice were bred at the University Paris Diderot, site Villemin, 
animal facility (Paris, France). All experiments described in this study 
were conducted in full accordance with the guidelines of our local 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Lariboisière-Villemin), 
with every effort made to minimize the number of animals used.
Gene Expression Analysis
Mice were overdosed with isoflurane and decapitated, and the brains 
were harvested. Cerebral pial arteries (15–150 µm diameter) were 
dissected under the microscope (Figure II in the online-only Data 
Supplement), immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored 
at −80°C until use. Brain arteries from 2 mice were pooled to prepare
1 sample. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 
performed in triplicate on a CFX connect Single-Color Real-Time 
PCR detection system (BioRad) using gene-specific primers showing
efficient amplification and the SYBR Green PCR master mix 
(BioRad) as previously described.9 Expression levels were normalized
for β-actin or transgelin mRNA.
Brain Parenchyma Histochemical and 
Immunohistochemical Analyses
Anesthetized mice were perfused transcardially with sodium phosphate
buffer, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. 
Brains were removed, half cut sagitally, and postfixed.18 One half was 
processed for paraffin embedding. Representative 7-µm-thick paraffin 
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Klüver-Barrera 
Luxol fast blue. Vacuoles are defined as well-delineated cavities in 
the brain tissue, distinct from vascular lumens, and infarcts are defined
as areas of focal brain necrosis.
The other half brain was cryprotected in 15% to 30% sucrose/
phosphate buffer at 4°C and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (Tissue-tek). Free-floating sections (16 µm) were incubated with 
mouse monoclonal anti–myelin basic protein (α-myelin basic protein
; 1:2000; SMI94R, Covance) followed by secondary antibody 
(Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG; 1:500; Invitrogen). This α-myelin 
basic protein antibody recognizes both the normal and degraded myelin
basic protein with a lower and higher affinity, respectively (E. 
Cognat, MD, and A. Joutel, MD, PhD, manuscript in preparation, 
2013). Myelin debris are defined as foci of hyperintense α-myelin 
basic protein immunoreactivity, as previously reported in patients 
with CADASIL.20 Sections from mutant and wild-type animals were 
processed in parallel.
Notch3ECD Staining
Mice were overdosed with isoflurane and decapitated, and the brains 
were harvested. Acetone-fixed cryosections (12 µm) were incubated 
with mouse monoclonal anti-Notch3ECD (clone 5E1, 1:2 dilution) and 
rabbit polyclonal anti–collagen IV (αColIV; 1:50 dilution, Novotec), 
followed by appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody 
(Invitrogen).
Imaging Analysis
Brain sections were analyzed by an investigator blinded to the genotypes.
Detailed information on imaging analysis is provided in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Multiple comparisons were evaluated
by 1-factor ANOVA followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. Values 
of P<0.05 were considered significant.

Results
A Molecular Toolbox to Directly Assess the In Vivo 
Consequence of CADASIL Mutations on NOTCH3 
Transcriptional Activity
Recently, we identified a core set of novel NOTCH3-RBPJ–
regulated genes in the context of brain artery development. 
These genes, which are predominantly expressed in arterial
SMC, are downregulated in the brain arteries of mice 
completely lacking NOTCH3 from the point of conception3
(A. Joutel, MD, PhD, unpublished data, 2012). Because of 
the dominant nature of CADASIL mutations, we first investigated
whether profiling expression of NOTCH3-RBPJ 
target genes could enable detecting a 50% reduction in 
NOTCH3 activity. We dissected the brain arteries of mice 
with half-normal dosage of NOTCH3 (Notch3+/−) and wildtype
littermates (1 month old) and quantified the expression 
level of previously reported and novel NOTCH3-RBPJ–
regulated genes.2,3 Of interest, mutant arteries do not exhibit 
any structural abnormalities in both young and old animals 
(data not shown). Nevertheless, we found that 11 among the 
18 genes analyzed were significantly downregulated in the 
brain arteries of Notch3+/− mice (Figure 1).
Because loss of NOTCH3 function may occur with 
aging, we examined whether profiling expression of 
NOTCH3-RBPJ target genes could enable detecting reduced 
activity after normal completion of arterial development. To 
this end, we generated mice with tamoxifen-induced deletion
of RBPJ in SMC from 10 weeks of age once arterial 
maturation is achieved (Figure 2A; Figure IA–IC in the 
online-only Data Supplement). SMC deletion of RBPJ in 
the adult did not produce any structural defects of brain 
arteries (Figure ID in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Importantly, a subset of 5 genes among the 18 genes tested 
were significantly downregulated in arteries of tamoxifentreated SMMHC-CreERT2,Rbpjflox/flox mice compared with those 
of oil-treated SMMHC-CreERT2,Rbpjflox/flox mice, including 
Notch3, as well as Grip2 and Nrip2, which were downregulated
in Notch3+/− mice (Figure 2B). Particularly, downregulation
of these genes results from the deletion of RBPJ but 
not from the tamoxifen treatment as previously established3
(E. Cognat, MD, and A. Joutel, MD, PhD, unpublished data, 
2013). Together, these findings provide us with an appropriate
molecular toolbox to detect a haploinsufficient loss of 
NOTCH3-RBPJ that may occur with aging.
Brain Arteries of Arg170Cys Knock-in Mice Display 
Prominent Notch3ECD Accumulation But Unaltered 
NOTCH3 Activity
We next used the molecular toolbox defined above to investigate
whether the archetypal Arg169Cys mutation mitigates
NOTCH3 activity in the brain arteries. Recently, we 
engineered a strain of mice harboring a heterozygous missense
Arg170Cys mutation (corresponding to Arg169Cys 
mutation in human NOTCH3) at the endogenous Notch3
locus (Notch3Arg170Cys), analogous to the situation in affected 
humans.14 Considering that Notch3ECD aggregates formation 
may interfere with NOTCH3 activity, we first verified that 
Notch3Arg170Cys heterozygous mice developed the characteristic
deposition of Notch3ECD in the brain arteries. Mutant mice, 
aged 6 to 7 months, showed marked granular anti-Notch3ECD
staining outlining the SMCs compared with wild-type mice, 
which exhibited diffuse and faint anti-Notch3ECD staining
(Figure 3A and 3B). We dissected the brain arteries of 
these mice and performed quantitative reverse-transcription 
PCR analysis. The results showed that expression level of 
all the genes tested did not differ between Notch3Arg170Cys
heterozygous and wild-type littermates (Figure 3C; Figure 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). We then assessed 
Notch3Arg170Cys homozygous mice, which exhibit far more 
pronounced Notch3ECD deposits in the brain arteries compared
with the heterozygous mice (Figure 3A and 3B). Brain 
arterial structure was unaltered in mutant mice (Figure IV in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Notably, the quantitative 
reverse-transcription PCR results showed that the expression
level of all the genes tested was not further reduced in 
Notch3Arg170Cys homozygous compared with Notch3Arg170Cys
heterozygous and wild-type littermate mice (Figure 3C;
Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). Thus, the 
data suggest that brain arteries of mice with the Arg170Cys 
mutation retain normal NOTCH3 activity despite extensive 
Notch3ECD deposition.
Eliminating Endogenous Wild-Type NOTCH3 
Does Not Exacerbate White Matter Degeneration 
in a Mouse Model With Arg169Cys Mutation, and 
Notch3 Null Mice Do Not Develop White Matter 
Degeneration
The earliest and most consistent brain abnormalities in 
CADASIL are white matter lesions, which precede the onset of 
clinical symptoms by 10 to 15 years.1 The TgPAC-Notch3R169C

mice, but not the Notch3Arg170Cys mice, develop a spontaneous 
age-dependent white matter phenotype.14,18 To assess further 
the possibility that the Arg169Cys mutant loses its activity or 
even exhibits a dominant-negative behavior with aging, and 
that loss of essential NOTCH3 function contributes to the 
CADASIL phenotype, we assessed the influence of eliminating
wild-type NOTCH3 in TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice on the 
onset and burden of white matter lesions.
TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice were crossed to Notch3KO mice 
to generate mice expressing Notch3R169C in the absence of 
endogenous Notch3, along with littermates with both endogenous Notch3 alleles. TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3−/− mice 
develop normally and display, like the TgPAC-Notch3R169C, 
Notch3+/+, no overt clinical phenotype. Interestingly, the load 
of Notch3ECD deposits in the brain arteries was comparable 
in TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/+ and TgPAC-Notch3 R169C, 
Notch3−/− mice (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement).
A prominent white matter pathology observed in 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice, on a normal background, is the vacuolation
of white matter tracts that manifests at ≈20 months 
of age. Vacuolation was assessed in the internal capsule and 
the fimbria at 12 (data not shown) and 20 months of age 
(Figure 4A). In TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3−/− mice, vacuolation
was absent at 12 months (data not shown) and was comparable
with the one seen in TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/+ mice 
at 20 months (Figure 4B). Remarkably, histological analysis 
demonstrated no significant vacuolation in mice completely 
lacking NOTCH3 at ≤20 months (Figure 4). Furthermore, 
none of the mice, be they Notch3−/− or TgPAC-Notch3 R169C, 
showed lacunar infarct.
Another prominent white matter pathology in the 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice is the accumulation of myelin debris, 
indicating myelin degradation (E. Cognat, MD, and A. Joutel, 
MD, PhD, manuscript in preparation, 2013). Density of myelin 
debris was assessed in the corpus callosum at 20 months of 
age (Figure 5A). Twenty-month-old TgPAC-Notch3R169C, 
Notch3−/− mice showed abundant myelin debris, although 
their density was comparable between TgPAC-Notch3R169C, 
Notch3−/− and TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/+ mice at the same 
age (Figure 5B). Notably, myelin debris were essentially 
absent in 20-month Notch3-null mice as in age-matched wildtype
mice (Figure 5A and 5B). Hence, the results indicate that 
complete absence of NOTCH3 does not result in white matter 
degeneration (ie, vacuolation and myelin degradation) at ≤20 
months and that white matter degeneration in transgenic mice 
with the Arg169Cys Notch3 mutation is not exacerbated in the 
complete absence of NOTCH3.
Discussion
Since the discovery that NOTCH3 mutations cause CADASIL, 
the question of whether malfunction of NOTCH3 receptor
causes the disease in all patients has been the subject of 
intense debate. This issue is directly relevant to future therapeutic
strategies based on the modulation of NOTCH3 activity 
or the reduction of mutant NOTCH3 level. The controversy 
came from the finding that, on the one hand, several mutations
, including those located in the mutational hotspot region, 
seem not to impair NOTCH3 activity, and that, on the other 
hand, all the mutations cause misfolding and aggregation 
of NOTCH3, which may inactivate the receptor, and a few 
mutations unambiguously result in a loss of NOTCH3 activity.21 The recent observation that a mutant allele can exhibit 
loss-of-function properties in an age-dependent manner has 
raised the hypothesis that, actually, all CADASIL mutations 
reflect hypomorphic NOTCH3 activity.11 Nevertheless, it is 
important to stress that such a scenario does not necessarily 
imply that phenotypic manifestations of the disease are driven 
by the loss of an essential NOTCH3 function. Interestingly,

Rutten et al22 recently reported 2 human subjects carrying an 
hypomorphic NOTCH3 allele that did not exhibit any of the 
CADASIL phenotypic features.
Herein, we reinvestigated this critical issue, taking advantage
of new molecular reagents allowing direct assessment 
of NOTCH3 activity in vivo and of the availability of mouse 
models that accurately mimic naturally occurring CADASIL 
mutation and spontaneously develop brain lesions relevant to 
CADASIL. Importantly, we present 3 lines of evidence arguing
against the general conclusion that all CADASIL mutations
reflect hypomorphic NOTCH3 activity and that reduction 
in NOTCH3 activity is a major driving force of the brain 
manifestations of this disease. First, using mice harboring 
the Arg170Cys mutation (corresponding to Arg169Cys mutation
in human NOTCH3) at the endogenous Notch3 locus,14
we show that the archetypal Arg169Cys NOTCH3 mutation 
does not mitigate NOTCH3 activity in the brain arteries at an 
age marked by extensive deposition of Notch3ECD aggregates. 
Notably, NOTCH3 activity was unaltered in homozygous 
mutant mice, although these mice are devoid of wild-type 
NOTCH3 and exhibit far more pronounced Notch3ECD aggregates
than the heterozygous mutant mice. Previous studies 
have examined the consequence of CADASIL mutations on 
NOTCH3 activity either in vitro, in cultured cells, or in vivo 
using indirect assays based on the ability of mutant NOTCH3 
to rescue the arterial defects of Notch3KO mice or their consequences.7–9,11,14 The approach we used here, quantifying in the 
brain arteries the expression level of NOTCH3 target genes 
relevant to NOTCH3 function in SMCs, is quite unique in 
this regard. Significantly, the subset of genes we have tested 
has proven to be appropriate to detect NOTCH3-RBPJ haploinsufficiency
, which could occur with aging (ie, after normal
completion of arterial maturation). Furthermore, the 
Notch3R170C mice we analyzed are especially relevant because 
they accurately mimic naturally occurring CADASIL mutation
, expressing endogenous level of wild-type and mutant

NOTCH3 protein. Second, we found that the elimination of 
wild-type Notch3 in mice overexpressing the Arg169Cys 
mutant Notch3 did not exacerbate the onset and burden of 
white matter lesions and did not produce lacunar infarcts. 
Remarkably, this finding cannot be attributed to differences 
in the Notch3ECD vascular load, which is comparable between 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3+/+ and TgPAC-Notch3R169C, 
Notch3−/−. Third, an approach to directly elucidate the contribution
of Notch3 loss of function to the brain manifestations 
is to assess the phenotype of Notch3 null mice. Herein, we 
showed that Notch3 null mice develop neither spontaneous 
white matter degeneration nor lacunar infarct at ≤20 months. 
Notably, we previously established that Notch3 protein and 
activity are completely absent in this line.17 Lack of spontaneous
brain lesions in these mice is intriguing and awaits further 
studies, given the presence of major structural and functional 
arterial defects. Finally, the data in both mouse models with 
the Arg169Cys mutation demonstrated that the wild-type 
Notch3 protein was not required for aggregation, either for 
stabilizing the mutant or for contributing to aggregates nucleated
by mutant Notch3.
The phenotypic expressivity shows marked variability 
among patients with CADASIL. Particularly, the data suggest
that the volume of white matter hyperintensities is 
influenced by genetic factors, although the specific genetic 
variants underlying this variability are still unknown.23 In 
this study, we had the opportunity to analyze the phenotype
of TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice on 2 different genetic 
backgrounds. Interestingly, we noticed that transferring the 
Notch3R169C mutation from an FVB/N into a C57BL/6 background
was associated with an attenuation of the myelin 
degradation phenotype (data not shown). Hence, this result 
supports the notion of genetic modifiers in CADASIL. 
Furthermore, it points out that the genetic strain must be 
carefully considered when modeling CADASIL, and possibly
other SVD, in the mouse.

We acknowledge several limitations in this study. First, 
we did not assess whether eliminating wild-type NOTCH3 
in the TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice exacerbates cerebrovascular 
dysfunction, which has been recognized as one of the earliest
manifestations in mouse models of CADASIL.21 The 
TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice and the Notch3−/− mice exhibit profound
vascular dysfunction, including decreased myogenic 
responses and impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood 
flow.17,18 Using a technical point of view, we estimated that 
the chances to detect further reduction of myogenic responses 
and alteration of cerebral blood flow responses in the double 
transgenic mice (TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3−/−) were low. 
Using a scientific point of view, we estimated the issue less 
relevant in the absence of exacerbation of brain lesions in 
the TgPAC-Notch3R169C, Notch3−/− mice. A second potential 
caveat is that the TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice still have wild-type 
Notch3 activity on a Notch3 null background (the present 
study and data not shown). Consequently, we could not elucidate
whether reduced Notch3 activity may play a modifying 
role on the disease course or whether brain manifestations of 
CADASIL can develop without any Notch3 signaling activity.
The Cys428Ser and Cys455Arg mutations map within 
the ligand-binding domain of Notch3 and both mutants lack 
Notch3 activity in vitro and in vivo. However, because the 
SM22-mediated expression of both Notch3 mutants in the 
mouse does not cause overt spontaneous brain lesions,10,11
these transgenic lines likely do not comprise an alternative 
strategy. Therefore, novel mouse models or approaches are 
needed to address these issues.
In conclusion, our present findings in the mouse provide 
strong evidence that CADASIL can develop without impairment
of NOTCH3 signaling and argue against a loss of 
NOTCH3 function as the driving mechanism for white matter 
lesions in CADASIL. Instead, the data are consistent with a 
model that invokes a toxic gain of function.
