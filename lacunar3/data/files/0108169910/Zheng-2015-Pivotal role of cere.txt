Abstract—Background: Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is required for
T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses and IL-17 production in
ischemic stroke. We previously showed that the IL-23/IL-17
axis aggravates immune injury after cerebral infarction in
mice. However, IL-23 might activate other cytokines and
transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) production in
cerebral ischemia. We aimed to determine whether IL-
23p19 knockdown prevents cerebral ischemic injury by
reducing ischemic-induced inflammation.
Methods: Ischemic stroke models were established by
permanent middle cerebral arterial occlusion (pMCAO) in
male C57BL/6 mice. In vivo gene knockdown was achieved
by intravenous delivery of lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding
IL-23p19 short hairpin RNA (LV-IL-23p19 shRNA). Enzymelinked
immunoassay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed inhibitory
efficiency. Behavioral deficits were evaluated by adhesiveremoval
somatic-sensory test. Brain infarct volume was
measured at day 5 after pMCAO by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining. Expression of IL-17, IL-4, interferon
(IFN)-c and Foxp3 in ischemic brain tissues were
detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.
Additionally, immunohistochemical staining located cytokines
in ischemic brain tissues.
Results: RNA interference knockdown of IL-23p19 resulted
in improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume.
IL-23p19 knockdown suppressed IL-17 gene and protein
expression. Moreover, IL-23p19 deficiency enhanced
IFN-c and Foxp3 expressions in delayed cerebral ischemic
mice, and did not impact IL-4 expression. Immunohistochemical
staining showed that IL-17, IL-4, IFN-c and
Foxp3-positive cells were located around ischemic lesions
of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
Conclusions: IL-23p19 knockdown prevents delayed cerebral
ischemic injury by dampening the ischemia-induced
inflammation, and is a promising approach for clinically
managing ischemic stroke.2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is one of the most severe neurological diseases
threatening millions of lives worldwide (Murray and
Lopez, 1997). Ischemic stroke accounts for about 87%
of the total number of stroke patients (He et al., 2012).
Stroke is a thrombotic disease caused by the occlusion
of cerebral arteries following disruption of energy supply
to brain tissues (Garcia et al., 1996; Marder et al.,
2006). Recent studies have demonstrated that cerebral
post-ischemic inflammation is mediated by infiltration of
immune cells, in particular macrophages, lymphocytes,
and dendritic cells (DCs) (Gelderblom et al., 2009;
Inacio et al., 2011; Joo et al., 2013), although these cells
and their effector cytokines were previously found in autoimmune
diseases (Dhodapkar et al., 2008; Steinman,
2010; Judson et al., 2012; Mieliauskaite et al., 2012;
Espigol-Frigole et al., 2013).
Inflammation-mediated brain injury is caused by the
interaction of both the innate and adaptive immune
systems (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). In the past years,
multiple investigations have discussed the importance of
infiltrating cells and their pro-inflammatory cytokines,
which lead to secondary injury after cerebral ischemia.
When brain ischemia occurs, infiltrated macrophages
and DCs are major sources of interleukin (IL)-23
(Carmody et al., 2007; Uemura et al., 2009). IL-23
expands and generates IL-17-producing T cells such as
T helper 17 (Th17) cells andcdT cells, which are capable
of inducing secondary injury after initial brain ischemia
(Shichita et al., 2009; Brait et al., 2012). Therefore, IL-
23 plays a key role upon downstream cells and cytokines
in cerebral ischemia. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine
comprising the common p40 subunit of IL-12 but binding
a specific p19 subunit (Wiekowski et al., 2001; Kastelein
et al., 2007). Significantly increased IL-23p19 expression,
both at messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein
levels, was demonstrated in multiple sclerotic lesions (Li

et al., 2007). Meanwhile, anti-IL-23p19 antibody is effective
in treating certain autoimmune diseases (Elson
et al., 2007; Cornelissen et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2013). Thus, from a therapeutic viewpoint, IL-23p19 might
represent a new target for ischemic stroke therapy.
Our previous research demonstrated increased IL-17-
positive cell numbers and IL-17 mRNA in the ischemic
hemisphere of permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO)-operated rats (Li et al., 2005). Further
study confirmed that the IL-23/IL-17 axis plays a key role
in cerebral infarction in the later phase of development,
and its down-regulation may attenuate inflammatory damage
(Ma et al., 2013). More importantly, some researchers
have found that depletion of the IL-23 gene results
in a more obvious protective effect than depletion of cd
T cells in the brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mouse
model (Brait et al., 2012), suggesting that IL-23 plays
additional roles in brain injury besides IL-17 induction
(Konoeda et al., 2010). It is also generally accepted that
other T cell-associated cytokines such as interferon
(IFN)-c, IL-4 and the transcription factor forkhead box
P3 (Foxp3) are involved in ischemic stroke (Jeong
et al., 2003). For example, IL-4 is a major negative regulator
of proinflammatory cytokine production by both brain
cells and T cells, and appears to play a key role in controlling
neuro-inflammation (Xiong et al., 2011). IFN-c contributes
to the maintenance, and perhaps the initiation of
inflammatory changes in the post-ischemic brain (Yilmaz
et al., 2006). Foxp3, which is arguably the best Tregassociated
cell marker, limits neuro-inflammation in permanent
cortical stroke (Liesz et al., 2013). However, little
is known about the relationship between IL-23 and these
cytokines in ischemic stroke.
Here, we report that IL-23p19 knockdown leads to
specific changes in downstream factors like IL-17, IL-4,
IFN-c and Foxp3, balancing the host immune
homeostasis and ameliorating neurological dysfunction.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and surgical procedures
The local ethics committee for animal research approved
the experimental protocol, and all procedures were
conducted following national and international guidelines
for the use of experimental animals. Male C57/BL6 mice
weighing approximately 25 g were included in the study.
Animals were housed on a 12-h-light/dark cycle at
controlled temperature and humidity with free access to
food and water. Mice were randomly assigned to the
following four groups: sham-operated group (sham
group, n= 12), pMCAO experimental group (pMCAO
group, n= 12), Lentiviral-mediated IL-23p19-specific
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (lentiviral vector (LV)-IL-
23p19 shRNA) delivery group (pMCAO + LV, n= 12)
and a negative control (NC) LV with scrambled shRNA
(LV-NC shRNA) delivery group (pMCAO + NC,
n= 12). The animals in each group were then assigned
to subgroups for tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining,
immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot
analysis. Thirty-three additional mice were randomly
divided into eleven groups to assess the infection
efficacy of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA before operation: PBS
group; LV-IL-23p19 shRNA groups, including 5, 10, 25,
50, and 100ll/d groups; LV-NC shRNA groups,
including 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100ll/d groups; all n= 3).
LV-IL-23p19 shRNAs infected more than 80% of cells at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 and successfully
silenced the expression of IL-23p19 in vitro.
After anesthetization with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
i.p.), mice were placed in a supine position and a midline
skin incision was made to expose the right common
carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and
external carotid artery (ECA). PMCAO was performed
by gently inserting a poly-L-lysine-coated 6-0
monofilament into the right internal carotid artery as
described previously (Longa et al., 1989). Sham-operated
mice were subjected to the same procedure but without
occlusion. The rectal temperature was maintained at
36C with a warming lamp. Animals without neurological
function deficits immediately after ischemia, those that
died within 5 days, and those with subarachnoid hemorrhage
at the time of death, were excluded from the
analysis.
IL-23p19 shRNA Lentiviral construction, preparation
and administration
Four shRNA sequences targeting mouse IL-23p19
(GenBank, Accession NM_031252) and a NC sequence
were designed and synthesized according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Genechem, Shanghai,
China). The best-performing IL-23p19 shRNA sequence
was GCAGGCAGCTGGCTAGAGA; TTCTCCGAAC
GTGTCACGT was used as NC scrambled shRNA (NC).
ShRNAs were cloned into a LV pGCsil-GFP containing
a CMV-driven EGFP reporter gene and a U6 promoter
upstream of the restriction sites (Genechem, Shanghai,
China). All constructs were confirmed by sequence
analysis. Recombinant lentiviral constructs were
produced by co-transfecting 293T cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA., USA;
cat. No. 11668-500) according to standard protocols.
Briefly, the culture medium was collected over 48 h,
concentrated by ultracentrifugation, aliquoted, and
stored at 80C until use. Viral titers, expressed as
transducing units (TUs) per milliliter, were determined
by measuring the GFP expression in 293T cells. This
was done by transducing 293T cells with serial dilutions
of concentrated lentivirus. The initial titers were
approximately 3109TU/ml.
Predetermined doses of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA (5, 10,
25, 50 and 100ll) tittered at 2107TU/ml and equal
amounts of LV-NC shRNA (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100ll) as
well as PBS control were injected by caudal vein once
daily for seven consecutive days before pMCAO (Zhou
et al., 2013). Next, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 055:B5,
Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected subcutaneously
to stimulate animals for 24 h. Afterward, brain
samples were respectively obtained for further study.

Brain sample preparation and enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA)
Brain samples were obtained from mice after different
doses of lentiviral shRNA were injected just before
pMCAO, and homogenized in cold RIPA buffer
containing 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
After a brief centrifugation step (4C, 15,000g), the
supernatants were carefully extracted and assayed
immediately with a mouse IL-23 Immunoassay Kit
(Quantikine ELISA, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis,
MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The standard curve and sample concentrations were
derived based on the mean of triplicates. IL-23
concentrations in brain tissues were measured and
reported as pg/ml.
Adhesive-removal somatosensory test
At various time points after the operation, the adhesion/
removal tape test for sensorimotor deficit evaluation was
performed as previously described (Bouet et al., 2009).
Briefly, two adhesive tapes were placed in one of the forelimbs.
The animal naturally tried to remove it and the time
elapsed before tape removal was measured. To decrease
inter-individual differences, a training session (1 week, one
trial per day) was carried out before surgical procedures
were conducted on mice to reach optimal performance.
Quantitative evaluation of infarct volume
Animals were anesthetized and euthanized 5 days postoperation.
Whole brains were quickly removed and
sectioned coronally into five 2-mm-thick sections that
were stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS for
approximately 20 min at 37C. Infarctions were
visualized and measured by using the Image J analysis
software (version 1.6 NIH).
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemical
staining
For histological analysis of mouse brains, animals were
anesthetized and perfused with 0.9% saline followed by
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) as described in
the experimental procedures. Brain tissues were paraffin
embedded and cut into 10-lm sections. After dewaxing
in dimethyl-benzene and rehydration in alcohol gradient,
sections were placed in 3% H
2
O
2
for blocking of
endogenous peroxidase activity and soaked in antigen
retrieval buffers with high pressure and heat. Sections
were incubated for 1 h with the blocking solution (5%
rabbit serum), washed several times, and then
incubated overnight at 4C with anti-IL-17 (1:200, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA), anti-IL-4 (1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-IFN-c (1:200, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-Foxp3 (1:200, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies, respectively.
Afterward, sections were rinsed, incubated for 2 h at
room temperature with biotinylated rat-anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.) or rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (1:100;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and stained with
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB). Primary
antibodies were omitted in Ncs.
Western blotting
The ipsilateral hemisphere was harvested 5 days after
ischemia, and homogenized in cold RIPA buffer
containing 1% PMSF. After brief centrifugation (4C,
15,000g), the supernatants were carefully collected.
Total protein concentrations were determined using the
Bradford method; equal protein amounts (50lg) were
separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels by SDS–PAGE
and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA, USA)
as previously described. Membranes were blocked with
5% skim milk in tris bufferred saline (TBS) containing
0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h, incubated overnight with
primary antibodies including rat anti-IL-17 (1:200;
Abcam), rat anti-IL-4 (1:200; Abcam), rat anti-IFN-c
(1:200; Abcam) or rabbit anti-Foxp3 (1:200; Abcam)
antibodies. After three washes with TBST, membranes
were incubated with secondary antibody (1:5000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 5% milk for 90 min. DAB
coloration was used for the detection of protein bands.
b-Actin was used as an internal control to determine
protein loading. Bands were quantified with the
AlphaView SA software (Cell Biosciences Inc. Santa
Clara, California, USA) by measuring band intensity
(area OD) normalized to b-actin.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from ipsilateral brain tissues of
mice 5 days after ischemia by TRIzol extraction
(Invitrogen). Samples were treated with gDNA Eraser to
remove any contaminating genomic DNA before reverse
transcription into cDNA with a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit
(Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan), according to the
manufacturer’s directions. qRT-PCR was performed on
an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with SYBR Green
Super mix (Roche); data were analyzed with 7500 Fast
System SDS software version 2.0.5 (Applied
Biosystems). Gene expression levels were normalized to
the housekeeping gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase). Fold changes were
calculated using the comparative Ct (2DDCt) method.
The primer sequences are shown inTable 1.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD)
of values from three separate experiments. The effects
of different shRNA doses were compared by a two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s post hoc
correction. The related data were analyzed by Student’s
T-test between two groups; a one-way ANOVA with
post hoc Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons were
used for the four experimental groups. All analyses were
performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
LV-IL-23p19 shRNA delivery results in decreased IL-
23 expression in vivo
As LV-IL-23p19 shRNA constructs contain an enhanced
GFP (EGFP) marker, we confirmed the distribution and
level of the lentiviral shRNA expression by direct
visualization under a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 1A).
The frozen sections of brain tissues were obtained after
intravenous injection of lentivirus at five different doses
without pMCAO. Compared with the PBS control, e-
GFP was observed in all LV-IL-23p19 shRNA and LVNC
shRNA injection groups, and distributed in the brain
tissue, especially in the cerebral cortex due to its
abundant blood flow. The fluorescence intensity was
proportional to LV-IL-23p19 shRNA dose, except for the
100ll/d group (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, in order to
evaluate the effects of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA on IL-23
expression, we performed qRT-PCR to detect IL-23
mRNA and ELISA for IL-23 protein quantification, in
brain tissue samples. Relative target gene expression
levels were lowest in the 25- and 50-ll injection groups,
indicating that they had the greatest inhibitory efficiency;
there was no statistical significance between these
groups (Fig. 1B). However, brain tissue ELISA,
reflecting the final stages of efficiency, showed that the
50-ll injection group was the most efficient (Fig. 1C).
Thus, subsequent experiments were performed with LVIL-23p19
shRNA at the optimal dose of 50ll/d.
IL-23p19 knockdown improves neurological scores
and reduces infarct volume
In order to assess whether IL-23p19 knockdown has a
protective role in mouse recovery, we evaluated
neurological scores and analyzed infarction volumes by
TTC staining. In the adhesive-removal test, the mean
times (shown in seconds) for removing the adhesive
tape from forelimb in the two groups were measured.
Less time was needed in the pMCAO + LV group
compared with the pMCAO + NC group (P< 0.05)
(Fig. 2A). Five days after the operation, mice in the
pMCAO + LV group showed a significantly reduced
infarct volume compared with the pMCAO + NC group
(P< 0.05) (Fig. 2B, C). These findings indicated
reduced infarction and neurological dysfunction after
delivery of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA.
IL-23p19 knockdown reduces IL-17 expression
It is generally accepted that IL-17 is the main effective
cytokine of Th17- andcdT cells, as well as astrocytes (Li
et al., 2005). We investigated the effect of LV-IL-23p19
shRNA on IL-17 mRNA and protein production. A dramatic
increase in IL-17 mRNA levels was observed in the
pMCAO group compared with sham treatment
(P< 0.001) (Fig. 3A). However, IL-17 mRNA levels were
sharply reduced after delivery of IL-23p19 shRNA in comparison
with the pMCAO + NC group (P< 0.001). These
changes in IL-17 mRNA expression, as measured by RTPCR
, almost paralleled the IL-17 protein production
(P< 0.001) (Fig. 3B). In addition, immunohistochemical
data confirmed the remarkable inhibitory effects of LV-IL-
23p19 shRNA on IL-17 expression in the peri-infarct area
(Fig. 3C), suggesting that IL-23 deficiency inhibits IL-17-
producing cells. Our results indicated that in the absence
of IL-23, IL-17 expression might decrease, which results
in a less pronounced delayed phase of cerebral ischemia.
IL-23p19 knockdown increases IFN-c expression
As expected, IFN-c mRNA levels increased in the
pMCAO group compared with the sham group
(P< 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, the pMCAO + LV
group showed significantly higher IFN-c mRNA levels
than the pMCAO + NC group (P< 0.001), although no
statistically significant differences were obtained
between the pMCAO and the pMCAO + NC groups
(P> 0.05). IFN-c protein expression was increased
after pMCAO (P< 0.001), but reached a much higher
level in the pMCAO + LV group compared with the
pMCAO + NC group (P< 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Consistent
with this finding, the histochemical staining showed a
similar tendency for IFN-c protein expression in the four
experimental groups. There were fewer IFN-c
expressing cells in the sham and pMCAO groups
(Fig. 4C). However, much more IFN-c positive (IFN-c+)
cells were observed in brain tissues from pMCAO + LV-
treated animals compared with the pMCAO + NC group
(Fig. 4C). These data indicated that LV-IL-23p19 shRNA
might promote IFN-c expression in the later phases of
cerebral infarction.
IL-23p19 knockdown does not impact IL-4 expression
RT-PCR showed that IL-4 mRNA levels in brain tissue
increased by twofold in the pMCAO group relatively to
the sham group (P< 0.05) (Fig. 5A). However, no
statistical significance was obtained between the
pMCAO + LV and the pMCAO + NC groups (P> 0.05)

(Fig. 5A). In addition, IL-4 protein expression levels
determined by Western blot followed the same trend
described for gene expression (Fig. 5B). The
immunohistochemical staining showed IL-4-positive cells
in the infarct boundary zones after pMCAO, while none
was found in the sham group (Fig. 5C). Additionally,
similar levels of IL-4 expression were observed in the
three operation groups (Fig. 5C). These results
indicated that LV-IL-23p19 shRNA had no influence on
IL-4 expression 5 days after cerebral ischemia.
IL-23p19 knockdown increases Foxp3 expression
As a transcription factor of functional regulatory T (Treg)
cells, Foxp3 mRNA levels showed no significant
differences between the sham and the pMCAO groups,
but increased significantly by nearly 30 times after
transfection with LV-IL23p19 shRNA (P< 0.001)
(Fig. 6A). However, a higher Foxp3 protein level was
obtained in the pMCAO group compared with sham
animals (P< 0.01); Foxp3 protein expression was
slightly increased in the pMCAO + LV group compared
with the pMCAO + NC group (P< 0.05), which differed
from the observations made for gene expression
(Fig. 6B). The histochemical staining data showed a
similar trend to Foxp3 mRNA levels, in that few Foxp3-
positive cells were observed in the sham and the
pMCAO groups (Fig. 6C). This number dramatically
increased in both pMCAO + LV and the pMCAO + NC
groups (Fig. 6C), which indicated an up-regulation of
Fig. 1. LV-IL-23p19 shRNA distribution in the brain results in decreased IL-23 expression just before pMCAO. (A) Mice were infected with different
doses of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA or LV-NC shRNA including 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100ll/d, and PBS control (100ll/d). After seven consecutive days just
before pMCAO, brain tissues were acquired and e-GFP fluorescence was assayed. The shRNAs carrying e-GFP were distributed in brain tissue,
most of which were in the cerebral cortex. The fluorescence intensity was observed by fluorescence microscopy (200 magnification). (B) Brain
tissue IL-23 mRNA expression levels at different doses of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA and LV-NC shRNA were analyzed by qRT-PCR. IL-23 gene

shRNA after cerebral ischemia.
DISCUSSION
The process of cerebral ischemia can upset the dynamic
balance between the pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory
responses. Secondary tissue injury after
stroke, which involves adaptive immunity with T helperand
Treg cells as its hallmark, shares many pathways
with primary injuries, enlightening many investigators to
develop therapeutic interventions to control the shift of
ischemic balance (Lo, 2009). Our present research
assessed the potential role of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA in
ameliorating the neurological deficits by regulating T cell
cytokines in the later phase of cerebral ischemia. By delivering
LV-IL-23p19 shRNA intravenously one week before
the operation (Zhai et al., 2013), mice successfully
acquired an e-GFP expressing LV-shRNA, which traversed
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), distributed through
the brain parenchyma, especially in the cortex, and negatively
affected IL-23 mRNA and protein expressions. Previous
works have demonstrated that cellular infiltration
peaks between 3 and 7 days after ischemia onset in permanent
MCAO (Li et al., 2005; Liesz et al., 2009; Zhou
et al., 2013), with IL-17 levels elevated at day 3 in pMCAO
mice (Shichita et al., 2009). Thus, we investigated the
related cytokines in brain samples 5 days after pMCAO.

dramatically decreased, leading to symptom
improvement. Histochemical examination revealed that

express IL-17, indicating their involvement in the
production of IL-17 after cerebral ischemia. This was in
line with our previous study, suggesting that the typical
IL-23-Th17 cd T cell-IL17 pathway is responsible for the
secondary ischemic injury after stroke (Li et al., 2005;
Ma et al., 2013). The common marker for Th1 immune
responses is the cytokine IFN-c, which is one of the key
participants in microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury

in I/R of the mouse brain (Yilmaz et al., 2006). We found
twofold increase in IFN-c expression after pMCAO compared
with sham mice, consistent with our previous study
(Li et al., 2001). Unexpectedly, a further elevation in IFN-c
mRNA and protein expression levels was observed in the
absence of IL-23, although there is no evidence demonstrating
an association between IL-23 and IFN-c, to the
best of our knowledge. A previous study on EAE showed
that anti-IL23p19 treatment reduced the number of IL-17-
producing cells without affecting IFN-c-producing cells,
suggesting that IFN-c could have a dampening role by
suppressing the development of IL-17 producing T helper
cells (Chen et al., 2006). Other studies have emphasized
the effect of IL-23 on the balance between IL-17 and IFN-
c by confirming that IL-23 favors the outgrowth of an IL-
17+/IFN-c- cell population (Hoeve et al., 2006; Yago
et al., 2007). Though the exact cell type generating the
majority of the IFN-c protein in this model remains to be
elucidated, we conclude that IL-23 deficiency might
severely reduce the IL-17/IFN-c ratio, probably by suppressing
Th17 (cdT)/Th1 cells, indicating that IFN-cmight
play protective roles in the later phases of cerebral
ischemia.
The Th2 cytokine IL-4 seems to play a neuroprotective
role, promoting tissue repair in cerebral ischemia. Given
that IL-4 deficiency exacerbates early ischemic brain
damage and neurological deficits in mice 24 h after
stroke, this might be expected (Xiong et al., 2011). Studies
have indicated that enforced expression of IL-23
enhances IL-4 production during Th2-cell–mediated
eosinophilic airway inflammation in mice (Wakashin
et al., 2008). Similarly, it has been suggested that knockdown
of IL-23 expression might inhibit the IgE response
through down-regulation of IL-4 expression in asthmatic
mice, given that IL-4 is crucial for the differentiation of
allergen-activated IgE-producing B cells (Li et al., 2011).
However, knockdown of IL-23 did not significantly modulate
IL-4 levels in the later phases of cerebral ischemia in
our current study, although a minimal increase of IL-4 production
in the pMCAO group was noticeable. The discrepancy
between these results might probably be explained
by the distinct period and style of inflammatory response
after cerebral ischemia, which is a cellular and adaptive
immune response involving both T lymphocyte activation
and cytokine production.
The amount of the Foxp3 protein is closely associated
with the immunosuppressive capacity of Treg cells (Wan
and Flavell, 2007; Tone et al., 2008; Van Loosdregt
et al., 2013). Thus, an increasing number of studies have
focused on the neuroprotective role of endogenous Treg
cells in cerebral ischemia by measuring the expression
of Foxp3 (Liesz et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Schabitz,
2013; Stubbe et al., 2013). Although evidence of a direct
relationship between IL-23 and Foxp3 has not been demonstrated
, it has been found, at least in colitis, that IL-23
could influence not only Th17 cell activity, but also affect
other types of immune responses: increased Foxp3+
cells in the absence of IL-23 were observed (Izcue
et al., 2008). Similarly, we confirmed that IL-23 deficiency
increased Foxp3+cells in the infarct boundary zones and
promoted Foxp3 expression both at mRNA and protein
levels. Since neurogenesis begins 5 days after stroke
(Wieloch and Nikolich, 2006), the increased Foxp3-
expressing Treg cells in the absence of IL-23 likely play
a role in repair and regeneration during the later phases
of stroke. Meanwhile, Foxp3 mRNA expression levels in
the LV-IL-23p19 shRNA group were not significantly different
from those obtained for the LV-NC shRNA group
as shown above, which were much higher than those of
the pMCAO group. The discrepancy is likely due to LVNC
shRNA also affecting other transcriptional factors
while entering the host cell.
IL-23p19 shRNA has multiple immunologic functions
on the expression of cytokines and transcription factors
in delayed cerebral ischemia. Since IL-23 expression is
rapidly increased at day 1 after stroke, attention should
be paid to time-limitation for its application. According to
a previous research, intravenous injection for 7 days of
lentivirus led to differences in the expression of the
transgene among various organs, including liver, brain
and lung (Du et al., 2009). Consistently, we observed that
e-GFP was distributed in the liver and kidney of mice
(data not shown). The inhibitory efficiency of systemic
administration in vivo may last to 40 days (Pan et al.,
2002). So delivery of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA could be carried
out several days before cerebral ischemia to prevent
the excessive immune response. Further exploration of
the function of LV-IL-23p19 shRNA on certain cell types,
especially those of the innate immune system like T
helper- and Treg cells, will be of great importance for
understanding the cell-differentiation network of the
immune response after cerebral ischemia.
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our results provide new insights into the complex
downstream effects of IL-23 and show that neuroinflammation
following ischemic stroke is a doubleedged
sword: not only it exacerbates secondary brain
injury, but it also beneficially contributes to brain
recovery. Therefore, pro- and anti-inflammatory
responses should not be evaluated separately; they
should instead be considered as a whole. Thus, our
findings confirm that IL-23p19 gene knockdown
efficiently suppresses the IL-23/IL-17 axis, decreases
the IL-17/IFN-c ratio and promotes Foxp3 expression,
eventually improving the outcomes of later cerebral
ischemia. Furthermore, lentiviral shRNA specially
targeting IL-23p19 might have a potential therapeutic
value in cerebral ischemia with the great advantage of
not disturbing global immunity.
