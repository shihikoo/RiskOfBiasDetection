Apoptosis is critical for the development of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Thioredoxin-1
(Trx-1) protein has been reported to have anti-apoptotic effects in a variety of cell
types, and it has been implicated in brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Thus, we studied the effects of Trx1 silencing after MCAO in rats and examined
whether inhibition of endogenous Trx1 could increase tissue levels of apoptosis. Male
Sprague–Dawley rats (N¼170) were subjected to 1 h of middle cerebral arterial occlusion
followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Trx1 siRNAs were injected into rat brains 24 h prior to
MCAO. Then, 24 h after MCAO, brains were collected from euthanized rats for investigation.
Treatment with Trx1 siRNA significantly increased mortality, behavioral deficits, and
cerebral infarction volume and exacerbated neuronal cell apoptotic death after MCAO
injury. Western blot revealed increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as P-ASK1, PJNK
, P-p38, cleaved caspase-3 and increased the level of cytochrome c in the cytosolic
fraction in the Trx1 siRNA-treated group. Co-immunoprecipitation assay suggested an
interaction between Trx1 and ASK1 in normal rat brains and Trx1 siRNA dissociated ASK1-
Trx1 binding complex. Our data suggest that Trx1 siRNA increases apoptotic stressinduced
ASK1 activation and this represents further evidence that Trx1 is an endogenous

1. Introduction
Apoptosis has been found to play a vital role in the development
of brain ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury (Dirnagl
et al., 1999; Mattson et al., 2001) and the relationship between
apoptosis and brain I/R injury has stimulated interest in the
development of anti-apoptotic therapies (Qi et al., 2010; Zhao
et al., 2010). Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a cellular redox enzyme
with multiple functions with respect to the regulation of cell
growth, apoptosis, and activation (Powis et al., 2000). Early
studies suggest a protective effect for Trx1 in the nervous
system after the application of various stressful stimuli. Both
Trx1 protein and mRNA were decreased in the ischemic core
and increased in the penumbra during permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats (Takagi et al., 1998),
and intravenous administration of Trx1 decreased brain
damage after transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice
(Hattori et al., 2004). Moreover, Trx1 overexpression protected
neurons from apoptosis after I/R in transgenic mice (Zhou
et al., 2009). Trx1 has been shown to interact directly with and
inhibit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a mitogenactivated
protein kinase (MAPK) kinase that activates 2 proapoptotic
kinases, JNK (Jun n-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK
(Saitoh et al., 1998), thus exerting its potent anti-apoptotic
effect in vitro. In addition, Trx1 has been shown to promote
ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation to inhibit ASK1-mediated
apoptosis in a redox activity-independent manner (Liu and
Min, 2002). Therefore, despite its critical regulatory role in
apoptosis signaling, the anti-apoptotic mechanism of Trx1 in
cerebral ischemia remains unclear.
Thus, we investigated the effects of Trx1 silencing using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) induced injury in rats and evaluated
whether the Trx1 siRNA could exacerbate neuronal cell
apoptotic death. We hypothesized that neuroprotection of
Trx1 may be associated with inhibition of the apoptotic ASK1-
JNK/p38 signaling pathway after MCAO injury.
2. Results
2.1. Trx1 siRNA reduced Trx1 mRNA and protein
expression levels
RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and qPCR (Fig. 1B) assays revealed that Trx1
mRNA expression increased in the MCAO and control siRNA

groups when compared to the sham group (*Po0.01), whereas
Trx1 siRNA treatment decreased Trx1 mRNA induced by
MCAO (#Po0.05). However, Trx1 mRNA was not affected by
control siRNA. Western blot of infarcted area of the cerebral
cortex confirmed strong up-regulation of Trx1 in the MCAO
and control siRNA groups after MCAO at 24 h compared to the
sham-operated group (*Po0.05), but this was markedly inhibited
by Trx1 siRNA (#Po0.05; Fig. 1C).
2.2. Trx1 siRNA increased infarction volume following
focal brain ischemia
After MCAO injury (24 h), rat brain infarction volumes were
measured with TTC staining and specific imaging software.
Representative samples of TTC-stained brain sections are
shown in Fig. 2A with corresponding infarction volumes
shown in Fig. 2B. A significant increase in infarction volume

stained brain sections from rats sacrificed 24 h after ischemia. No ischemic lesion was observed in the sham group. Infarct
volumes were increased in MCAO and MCAOþ control siRNA groups relative to the sham group. Trx1 siRNA treatment
significantly increased the infarct volume (B) Statistical analysis of infarct ratio. Trx1 siRNA treatment significantly increased
the infarction area compared with the MCAO and MCAOþcontrol siRNA groups 24 h after MCAO. (C) Rat mortality within 24 h

14.3%, respectively). (D) Neurological scores. All animals developed neurobehavioral deficits after MCAO injury. Treatment
with Trx1 siRNA significantly improved neurobehavioral deficits (i.e., increased scores) at 24 h. Data are presented as

was observed in all rats of MCAO and MCAOþ control siRNA
groups (*Po0.05 vs. sham), but the infarct ratios were severely
increased by about 40.5% in rats treated with Trx1 siRNA
(#Po0.05 vs. MCAO and control siRNA respectively).
2.3. Trx1 siRNA increased mortality and neurobehavioral
deficits after MCAO
The mortality of rats 24 h after MCAO is shown in Fig. 2C.
Fisher's exact test revealed that Trx1 siRNA significantly
increased mortality (#Po0.05 vs. MCAO and control siRNA
groups). The mean neurobehavioral scores are shown in
Fig. 2D. Trx1 siRNA markedly increased neurobehavioral
deficits, compared to MCAO and control siRNA groups at
24 h (#Po0.05).
2.4. Trx1 siRNA decreased the number of intact neurons
HE and Nissl staining were used to document morphological
changes in the infarct area 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 3A–C).
Compared with the sham group, the neurocytes in the MCAO
and control siRNA groups showed a disorderly arrangement
with loosened cytoplasms and karyopyknosis. However, in
the Trx1 siRNA group, it showed diffuse vacuolization and
edema in the interstitial spaces and Trx1 siRNA significantly
decreased the number of intact neurocytes (Fig. 3A). Sham
group cortical neurons had no morphological changes. In the
MCAO and control siRNA groups, there were many atrophic
neurons, with shrunken cytoplasms and damaged nuclei.
Most neurons showed disappearance of Nissl body. However,
administration of Trx1 siRNA increased the number of
degenerated neurons and significantly decreased the number
of intact neurons (#Po0.01; Fig. 3B and C).
2.5. Trx1 siRNA increased apoptotic activity
TUNEL detects DNA fragmentation arising from apoptotic
signaling cascades, so TUNEL-positive cells containing apoptotic
bodies and darkly stained cells were considered apoptotic.
The sham group had no obvious TUNEL-positive cells, and
cells treated with Trx1 siRNA had a significantly increased
number of TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbra of brain
relative to the MCAO and control siRNA groups (#Po0.01;
Fig. 4A and B). Western blot confirmed increased the level of
cytosolic cytochrome c and expression of cleaved caspase-3
in both the MCAO and control siRNA groups compared to
sham animals (*Po0.05; Figs. 5A and B). After administration
of Trx1 siRNA, cytosolic cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3
were significantly increased (#Po0.05 vs. MCAO and control
siRNA).
2.6. Trx1 siRNA activated ASK1 and the downstream
effectors JNK and p38
To understand why administration of Trx1 siRNA causes cells
to become easily apoptotic, we examined whether Trx1 siRNA
could promote the activation of ASK1 and downstream
effectors JNK and p38 by immunoblot analysis. As shown in
Fig. 6A, phosphorylation of ASK1 (P-ASK1) normalized to total
ASK1 (P-ASK1/ASK1) was elevated in MCAO and control
siRNA groups when compared to sham (*Po0.05), and this
was more exaggerated in the Trx1 siRNA group (#Po0.05 vs.
MCAO and control siRNA). Total ASK1 was probed and was
constant in the four groups. In addition, ASK1 activation also
activated JNK and p38 (Fig. 6B and C). Activation (phosphorylation
) of JNK (P-JNK) and p38 (P-p38) were found in the
MCAO and control siRNA groups (*Po0.05 vs. sham) and
effects in the Trx1 siRNA group were more pronounced
(#Po0.05 vs. MCAO and control siRNA). In contrast, expression
of JNK and p38 (unphosphorylated form) was
unchanged.
2.7. Trx1 siRNA dissociated ASK1/Trx1 binding complex
Because Trx1 is known to bind with ASK1 and to prevent
ASK1 activation, we examined whether ASK1 dissociated
from Trx1 after I/R and whether Trx1 siRNA could dissociate
the ASK1/Trx1 binding complex leading to increased P-ASK1
expression. Rat brains were lysed and immunoprecipitated
with anti-Trx1 or anti-ASK1 antibody followed by Western
blot with anti-ASK1 or anti-Trx1 antibody. To confirm the
specificity of the Trx1 or ASK1 antibody used in this Co-IP
assay, we immunoprecipitated the sham samples with normal
IgG as a negative control. No interacting bands between
Trx1 and ASK1 were detected. We detected an interaction
between Trx1 and ASK1 under physiologically normal conditions
in the rat brain, and this interaction was disrupted by I/
R( Fig. 7A and B). Total ASK1 protein determined by Western
blot of lysates in all groups was similar (data not shown).
ASK1 associated with Trx1 decreased in the MCAO and
control siRNA groups (nPo0.05 vs. sham), whereas Trx1 siRNA
dramatically reduced ASK1 (#Po0.05 vs. MCAO and control
siRNA; Fig. 7C and D). These results are consistent with the
studies on the phosphorylation of ASK1 (Fig. 6A).
3. Discussion
The present study was designed to study the effects of Trx1
silencing after MCAO in rats, specifically investigating
whether inhibition of endogenous Trx1 could exacerbate
neuronal apoptosis in this type of injury. We applied RNA-
interference targeting Trx1 in a rat model of MCAO-induced
focal ischemia. Administration of Trx1 siRNA significantly
increased mortality, brain infarct size, neurobehavioral deficits
, and neuronal cell death in our rat model. Trx1 siRNA
effectively inhibited Trx1 mRNA and protein expression and
increased immunoreactive expression of P-ASK1, P-p38, PJNK
, cleaved caspase-3. and the level of cytochrome c in the
cytosolic fraction These data suggest that abatement of Trx1
may be harmful in cerebral ischemia in the acute phase, and
an elevation of Trx1 could be neuroprotective with respect to
brain damage.
Trx1 is an endogenous 12-kDa anti-oxidant enzyme with
two redox active half-cysteine residues, –Cys–Gly–Pro–Cys–.
This protein is ubiquitously expressed in all living cells and
has a variety of biological functions related to cell proliferation
and apoptosis (Holmgren, 1985, 1989; Yamawaki et al., 2003).
Clinical and experimental results show that genetic inhibition
of endogenous Trx1 in the heart increases oxidative stress

(Yamamoto et al., 2003), and acute inhibition of Trx1 abolishes
preconditioning-induced cardiac protection (Turoczi et al.,
2003). In contrast, overexpression of Trx1 confers resistance
to ROS-induced cell death (Chen et al., 2002; Damdimopoulos
et al., 2002; Patenaude et al., 2004). In addition to its oxidoreductase
activity, early studies show that increased Trx1 is
correlated to decreased apoptosis in gastric carcinomas
(Grogan et al., 2000). Conversely, a small hairpin RNA against
Trx1 was reported to improve ventricular function, reduce
infarct size, and reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis after ischemia
in the rat heart (Malik et al., 2006). Moreover, Trx1 activity
is markedly reduced in diseased tissues in which pathological
apoptosis is increased (Lovell et al., 2000; Yamawaki et al.,
2003). Cumulatively, these data strongly suggest that altered
Trx1 expression and/or activity play critical pathogenic roles in
human diseases and that Trx1 may be a novel therapeutic
target for those diseases, such as stroke, in which a physiological
balance between cell death and cell proliferation is
disturbed. Since Takagi et al. (1998) reported that both Trx1
protein and mRNA were decreased in the ischemic core and
increased in the penumbra during permanent MCAO in rats,
most studies have focused on Trx1 effects on stroke. Ischemic
brain injury was attenuated in transgenic mice overexpressing
Trx1 and intravenous administration of Trx1 decreases brain
damage after ischemia in mice (Hattori et al., 2004; Takagi
et al., 1999). In addition, overexpression of Trx-1 in transgenic
mice decreased neuronal degeneration and apoptosis after
mild focal ischemia (Zhou et al., 2009). In the present study, we
have confirmed that after Trx1 siRNA administration, a significant increase in mortality, brain infarct size, neurobehavioral
deficits and neuronal cell death were observed.
Additionally, Trx1 siRNA increased apoptotic activity and
Western blot revealed that the involvement of key apoptotic
related proteins all increased after Trx1 siRNA administration.
These results not only support previous observations but also
suggest that Trx1 can also be a regulator for apoptosis after

MCAO injury in rats and indicate that Trx1 is an endogenous
neuroprotective protein against stroke.
However, little is known about how silencing Trx1 affects
neuronal apoptosis during cerebral ischemia. Direct interactions
with chemically reactive species may occur, but effects
on signaling pathways are likely to be more important in Trx1
functions (Watson et al., 2004). Trx1 binds with ASK1 (Saitoh
et al., 1998), creating an inactive complex. Certain apoptosisinducing
stresses can break this complex, activating ASK1
and leading to the activation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase
(JNK)/p38 MAP kinases and apoptosis (Tobiume et al., 2001).
JNK and p38 kinase pathways belong to the MAP kinase
signaling cascade, which typically consists of three layers
of protein kinases including MAP kinase kinase kinase
(MAPKKK), MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) and MAP kinase
(MAPK) (Davis, 1994; Waskiewicz and Cooper, 1995;

Widmann et al., 1999). Through hierarchical phosphorylation,
MAPK is activated and then, in turn, regulates the activities of
downstream transcription factors or other kinases to control
gene expression. ASK1, a member of the MAP kinase kinase
kinase (MAP3K) family, is an upstream activator of JNK and
p38 MAPK signaling cascades (Davis, 2000). Activated Ask1
leads to the recruitment/activation of MKK-4/7 and MKK-3/6,
which in turn activate JNK and p38 MAPK, respectively (Ichijo
et al., 1997). ASK1 is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal
domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal
regulatory domain (Chang et al., 1998; Hatai et al., 2000;
Tobiume et al., 2001). Its activity is regulated at multiple
steps, including dimerization, phosphorylation, and protein–
protein interactions, events that are modulated by several
cellular stressors (Hwang et al., 2005; Matsuzawa et al., 2002).
A reduced but not oxidized form of Trx1 interacts with the
N-terminus of ASK1 and suppresses ASK1 kinase activity as
well as ASK1-dependent apoptosis. ASK1ΔN, which is an
N-terminal truncated mutant of ASK1 lacking a Trx1 binding
region, is thus a constitutively active mutant and more

potently induces apoptosis in various cultured cells (Fujino
et al., 2007; Kanamoto et al., 2000; Saitoh et al., 1998).
Interaction between Trx1 and ASK1 is observed only under
reducing conditions. When cells are subjected to apoptotic
stimuli, the oxidized form of Trx1 dissociates from ASK1,
resulting in the autophosphorylation-dependent activation of
the kinase (Liu et al., 2000; Matsukawa et al., 2004), thus
facilitating apoptotic cell death (Matsuzawa et al., 2002).
Another study suggested that Trx1 could promote ASK1
ubiquitination and degradation to inhibit ASK1-mediated
apoptosis in endothelial cells (Liu and Min, 2002). Therefore,
the mechanism by which Trx1 affects neuronal apoptosis
during cerebral Ischemia remains questionable. It has been
reported that inhibition of Trx1 activity by antisense oligonucleotides
or by Trx reductase inhibitor resulted in activation
of endogenous ASK1 activity (Saitoh et al., 1998).
So in this study we hypothesize that Trx1 siRNA will
dissociate ASK1/Trx1 binding complex and activate endogenous
ASK1. Our investigation demonstrated that there was an
interaction between Trx1 and ASK1 under physiologically
normal conditions in the rat brain, this interaction was
disrupted by ischemic reperfusion. However, Trx1 siRNA
dramatically reduced the amount of ASK1 associated with
Trx1, resulting in the increased phosphorylation of ASK1, as
well as the phosphorylation of JNK and the p38 MAPKs, and
onset of apoptosis. ASK1 executes apoptosis mainly via
mitochondrion-dependent caspase activation. Overexpression
of wild type ASK1 induces cytochrome c release from
the mitochondrion, which activates caspase-3 (Matsuzawa
and Ichijo, 2001). In our study, we found that Trx1 siRNA
facilitated the release of cytochrome c and activated caspase-
3. It is our belief that phosphorylation of ASK1 after Trx1
siRNA can either promote activation of JNK and p38 leading
to apoptosis and/or directly resulting in the apoptosis cascade.
Thus, inhibition of Trx1 with siRNA may activate the
ASK1-JNK/p38 pathway and exacerbate neuronal apoptosis
after MCAO injury.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Animals and experimental groups
One hundred and seventy adult male Sprague–Dawley rats
(250–280 g) were housed in a room with controlled temperature
(2273 1C) and humidity (6075%) and a 12-h light/12-h
dark cycle. Food and water were available continuously
before the operation. A total of 170 rats were randomly
assigned to the following four groups: sham surgery (n¼36),
middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO) (n¼41; 5
died), MCAO treated with control siRNA (n¼42; 6 died) and
MCAO treated with Trx1 siRNA (n¼51; 15 died).
All experiments procedures were carried out in accordance
with the National Institute of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing
Medical University, China. The animal production license
and animal license of Chongqing Medical University are SYXK
(Chongqing) 2007-0001, SCXK (Chongqing) 2007-0001.
4.2. Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
model
Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO in rats as
described in detail in our previous study (Zhao et al., 2010). A
nylon filament (0.26 mm diameter) with a rounded tip (2636-
100, Sunbio Biotech, Beijing, China) was gently introduced
into the left internal carotid artery through the common
carotid artery to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral
artery. After 60 min of MCAO, the nylon filament was carefully
pulled out to establish reperfusion. Rats that did not
show neurological deficits immediately after reperfusion
(neurological score o1) were excluded from the study and
rats that showed neurological deficits immediately after
reperfusion (neurological score 40) but were found to be
experiencing skull base hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage
were also excluded from the study. Sham-operated
animals underwent exposure of vessels without occlusion of
the common carotid arteries. Then, animals were returned to
their cages after recovering from anesthesia and allowed with
free access to food and water.
4.3. Treatment with Trx1 siRNA
Specific siRNA targeting against Trx1 (the sense primer 50-
AAGCUCGAAGCCACUAUUATT-30 and antisense primer 50-
UAAUAGUGGCUUCGAGCUUTT-30) were designed and chemically
synthesized and PAGE-purified according to the manufacturer's
instructions (GenePharma Corporation, Shanghai,
China). Negative siRNAs with no sequence homology to any
known human genes were used as the control. All siRNA
were dissolved in DEPC water. Intracerebroventricular injection
was executed according to a protocol as previously
described (Senn et al., 2005). Rats were anesthetized with
3.5% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic
apparatus (DW-2000D, Taimeng Software, Chengdu,
China). Trx1 siRNA or control siRNA mixture was slowly
injected into the left lateral ventricle using a Hamilton
microsyringe (coordinates 1.0 mm posterior to the bregma,
2.0 mm lateral to the midline, and 4.0 mm ventral to the
surface of the skull) under the guidance of a stereotaxic
instrument. At the end of the injection, the microinjector
was kept immobile for 5 min before withdrawal. After 24 h, all
rats were subjected to transient MCAO as described above.
4.4. Assessment of neurological deficits and mortality
Neurological deficits were assessed 24 h after reperfusion by
one investigator blinded to the study groups according to the
method described by Longa et al. (1989). Neurologicalfindings
were scored on a 5-point scale: 0 suggests no neurological
deficit (normal); 1 suggests a mild neurological deficit (failure
to extend right forepaw fully); 2 suggests a moderate neurological
deficit (circling to the right); 3 suggests a severe
neurological deficit (falling to the right); and 4 suggests a
very severe neurological deficit (rat did not walk spontaneously
, had depressed consciousness). The mortality was
calculated at the same time point, as well as the immediate
intraoperative mortality.

4.5. TTC staining and evaluation of infarction volume
Samples from all four groups (n¼6/group) were used for
analysis. After neurological assessment, rats were sacrificed
by decapitation and brains were rapidly removed and sliced
into 2-mm-thick coronal sections in an adult rat brain matrix
(BJK-003, J&K Seiko Electronic Co., Ltd. Guangdong, China).
Brain slices were stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (17779, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 1C in the dark to
detect infarct area and subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight. Normal tissue stained red, and infarct
tissue did not stain (appeared white). Each slice was photographed
with a digital camera (Nikon, D5100) and analyzed
using an Image J (ver1.37c, NIH).
To compensate for brain edema, the corrected volume was
calculated using the following equation: Percentage hemisphere
lesion volume (% HLV)¼{[total infarct volume(left
hemisphere volumeright hemisphere volume)]/right hemisphere
volume}100%.
4.6. Tissue preparation and histological assessment
Samples from four groups (n¼6/group) were used for tissue
experiments. After neurological examination, rats were killed
with an overdose of 3.5% chloral hydrate 24 h after reperfusion
, and brains were perfused transcardially with 0.9%
sodium chloride followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After
decapitation, brains were removed and embedded in paraffin.
Then, 5-μm coronal sections 1.20 mm anterior to and 3.6 mm
posterior to the bregma were stained with 0.1% cresyl violet
(Nissl staining) or hematoxylin–eosin (HE staining) according
to standard protocols and prepared for subsequent microscopic
mounting. Intact neurons were counted in ten fields
for each section under a light microscope (400). The cell
count obtained from same group of animal were averaged
and expressed as cell number/mm2 (Xu et al., 2006).
4.7. TUNEL staining
Samples(n¼6/group) were used for TUNEL staining which
was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions
(11684817910, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc., Mannheim
, Germany). Briefly, sections were treated with Proteinase
K (20μg/mL for 15 min) and 0.3% H
2
O
2
for 30 min. Then
sections were incubated with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase (TdT) enzyme at 37 1C for 1 h and further incubated
with peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 30 min at
37 1C. Sections were allowed to react with 3,30-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride solution for 10 min at room temperature.
Under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51, Japan),
TUNEL-positive cells identified by green fluorescence of FITC
were counted in ten microscopic fields of each brain section
at 400 magnification in the penumbra of the ipsilateral
brain subjected to ischemia. The cell count obtained from
same group of animal were averaged and expressed as cell
number/mm2 (Xu et al., 2006).
4.8. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis
Animals (n¼8/group) were killed 24 h after reperfusion for RTPCR
and qPCR. Total RNAs were isolated from the brain cortex
including the infracted area with RNAiso Plus (Code no. 9109,
Takara Biotechnology, China) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. RNAs were reverse transcripted to cDNAs with polyt
primer and subjected to PCR. PCR conditions were 95 1C for 
3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 1C, 30 s at 58 1C, and
1minat721C; after cycles were completed, samples were kept at
72 1C for an additional 10 min. As an internal control, GAPDH was
amplified under similar conditions. The PCR products, 206 bp
and 595 bp, for Trx1 and GAPDH respectively, were separated on
2% agarose gel and detected with ethidium bromide. Primer pairs
for Trx1 and GAPDH specific amplification of cDNA were as
follows: sense primer 50-TCTTTCATTCCCTCTGTGACAA-30 and
antisense primer 50-AGAGCATGATTAGGCAAACTCC-30 for Trx1;
sense primer 50-CAGTGCCAGCCTCGTCTCAT-30 and antisense
primer 50-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-30 for GAPDH.
For quantitative PCR, Trx1 cDNA was amplified with the SYBR
Premix Ex Taq II (Code no. RR820A, Takara Biotechnology, China)
following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used in the study
were: sense primer 50-CCTTCTTTCATTCCCTCTGTGA-30 and
antisense primer 50-CCCAACCTTTTGACCCTTTTTA-30 for Trx1.
The Trx1 gene expression of each sample was normalized to
GAPDH expression. qPCR conditions included an initial denaturation
at 95 1C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 1C, 15 s
at 60 1C, and 15 s at 72 1C.
4.9. Immunoblotting (IB) and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-
IP) assay
Animal brains (n¼10/group) were perfused with cold saline.
Proteins were extracted from the ischemic cortex 24 h after
reperfusion according to procedures described previously
(Holmgren, 1985; Jia et al., 2009). The cytosolic fraction of
cells were obtained using the BioVision fractionation kit
(K256-100, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Protein concentration was measured with a
Pierce BCA protein assay kit (23225, Thermo Scientific, Rockford
, MD). The equivalent extracted protein was separated
using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter
membrane. Membranes for cytosolic fraction were probed for
cytochrome c. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat
milk containing 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBS-T) and then incubated with primary antibodies
against Trx1 (1:500, monoclonal, 2429, Cell Signaling),
ASK1 (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, 8662S, Cell Signaling), PASK1
(1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, 3764, Cell Signaling), cleaved
caspase-3 (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, 9654S, Cell Signaling),
p38 (AP0424), P-p38 (BS4635), JNK (BS3631), P-JNK (BS4322),
cytochrome c (BS6440) (all from Bioworld Technology, Inc.),
each diluted 1:500, and GAPDH (1:5000, rabbit polyclonal,
AP0063, Bioworld Technology, Inc.), overnight at 4 1C. After
washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies
at room temperature for 60 min. Blots were subjected to
gel formatting (BIO-RAD) and quantified through Quantity
One analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal loading control.

For the Co-IP assay, the protein concentration in supernatants
was adjusted to 1 mg/ml and 0.5 ml of the lysate was
incubated with 6μg of Trx1 antibody or Ask1 antibody overnight
, and then incubated with 40μL of resuspended volume
of Protein A/G-agarose beads (BD0045, Bioworld Technology,
Inc.) at 41C for 4 h. Washing was performed four times in the
original lysis buffer. Coimmunoprecipitated Ask1 or Trx1 was
detected by Western blot with Ask1 or Trx1 antibodies.
Normal IgG (BS10350, Bioworld Technology, Inc.) was used
as a negative control.
4.10. Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean7SEM. Statistical differences
between various groups were analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey multiple-comparison
test. Neurological deficit scores were analyzed with a Mann–
Whitney U test. For the statistical analysis of mortality,
Fisher's exact test was used for two-group comparisons.
The SPSS19.0 statistical software package was used and
Po0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
