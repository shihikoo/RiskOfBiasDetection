N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2-oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC), an N-acetyl serotonin derivative
, selectively activates tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB). This study is to investigate a potential
role of HIOC on ameliorating early brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One
hundred andfifty-six adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were used. SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation.
TrkB small interfering RNA (siRNA) or scramble siRNA was injected intracerebroventricularly 24 h before
SAH. HIOC was administrated intracerebroventricularly 3 h after SAH and compared with brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). SAH grade and neurologic scores were evaluated for the outcome study. For the
mechanism study, the expression of TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB), phosphorylated extracellular signal
regulated kinase (p-ERK), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) was detected by Western
blots,andneuronalinjurywas determined bydoubleimmunofluorescence stainingof neuronal nuclei and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling. Knocking down of
TrkB decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and aggravated neurologic deficits 24 h after SAH. HIOC activated TrkB/
ERK pathway, decreased neuronal cell death, and improved neurobehavioral outcome, and these effects were
abolished by TrkB siRNA. HIOC was more potent than BDNF in reduction of apoptosis 24 h post-SAH. Thus, we
conclude that administration of HIOC activated TrkB/ERK signaling cascade and attenuated early brain injury
after SAH. HIOC may be a promising agent for further treatment for SAH and other stroke events.

Introduction
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for only 5% of all stroke
incidents. However, due to its high rate of death and complications,
the management of SAH remains to be one of the toughest challenges
faced by physicians (Suarez et al., 2006; van Gijn et al., 2007). The importance
of early brain injury after SAH has been emphasized in the
last decade as a key issue that may affect the prognosis of SAH (Caner
et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Kusaka et al., 2004; Sehba et al., 2012).
Recent studies have shown that anti-apoptosis may attenuate early
brain injury after experimental SAH (Hasegawa et al., 2011b).
Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) belongs to the receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) family (Boulle et al., 2012). Phosphorylation of
TrkB ameliorated brain injury in ischemic stroke models (Cui et al.,
2013; Van Kanegan et al., 2014). Our previous study revealed that the
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB signaling pathway was
involved in apoptosis after SAH (Hasegawa et al., 2011a). N-acetyl serotonin
(NAS), which is an intermediate in the endogenous synthesis
of melatonin from serotonin, has been demonstrated to activate TrkB
receptor and exert anti-depressant effects in a TrkB-dependent
manner (Jang et al., 2010). N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2-
oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC) is one of the derivatives of NAS.
It selectively activates TrkB receptor with greater potency than NAS
(Shen et al., 2012). However, the role of HIOC in stroke models has
not been evaluated.
In the present study, we hypothesized that administration of HIOC
would activate TrkB and its downstream effector extracellular signal

regulated kinase (ERK), thereby, attenuating neuronal injury after
experimental SAH.
Materials and methods
Animals
One hundred andfifty-six adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN) weighting 280–320 g were used in this study. All experimental
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Loma Linda University.
Experimental design
The experiment was designed as follows:
Experiment 1
To determine the role of TrkB receptor in SAH, twenty-nine rats
were divided into four groups: sham with burr hole (n = 6), vehicle
(5 μl sterile saline) + SAH (n = 7), TrkB small interfering RNA
(siRNA) (500 pmol/5 μl) + SAH (n = 9) and scramble siRNA
(500 pmol/5 μl) + SAH (n = 7). Vehicle or siRNAs were injected
intracerebroventricularly 24 h before SAH was induced. Neurologic
score, SAH grade, and the expression of TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB
(p-TrkB), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were tested 24 h after SAH.
Experiment 2
For outcome evaluation, eighty-four rats were assigned into
five groups: sham (n = 16), SAH (n = 14), SAH + vehicle (n = 19),
SAH + HIOC (6 μgin5μl vehicle) (n = 17), and SAH + HIOC (30 μg
in 5 μl vehicle) (n = 18). Vehicle or HIOC was injected intracerebroventricularly
3 h after SAH onset. The neurologic score and
SAH grade were assessed at 24 and 72 h.
Experiment 3
Forty-three rats were divided into five groups for mechanism
study: sham (n = 10), SAH + vehicle (n = 10), SAH + HIOC (n =
10), scramble siRNA + SAH + HIOC (n = 6), and TrkB siRNA +
SAH + HIOC (n = 7). The scramble or TrkB siRNAs were injected 24 h
before SAH modeling. The expression of TrkB, p-TrkB, phosphorylated
ERK (p-ERK) and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) was measured by Western
blot, and immunostaining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated
uridine 5′-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL)
were conducted 24 h after SAH.
Experiment 4
To compare the therapeutic effects between HIOC and BDNF in the
SAH model, forty-eight rats were divided into four groups: sham
(n = 12), SAH + vehicle (n = 12), SAH + HIOC (n = 12), and
SAH + BDNF (5 μgin5μl vehicle) (n = 12). Vehicle, HIOC or BDNF
was administered 3 h after SAH modeling. Neurologic score, SAH
grade and Western blots were detected at both 6 and 24 h after SAH.
Brain samples from Experiments 3 and 4 in sham, vehicle and HIOC
treatment groups at 24 h after SAH were shared with the samples from
Experiment 2.
SAH model
The SAH rat model was induced by endovascular perforation, as previously
described (Chen et al., 2013). All animals were transorally
intubated after induced anesthesia with 5% isoflurane in 70/30%medical
air/oxygen, and a small rodent respirator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston,
MA) wasused tomaintain anadequate respiration.Anesthesia wasthen
maintained with 3% isoflurane in 70/30% medical air/oxygen.
The external carotid artery (ECA) was identified and transected distally
with a 3 mm stump. A 4-0 sharpened monofilament nylon suture
was advanced into the internal carotid artery (ICA) through the ECA
until resistance was felt (at 18–20 mm) and then was pushed 5 mm further
to penetrate the bifurcation of the anterior and the middle cerebral
artery. The suture was then withdrawn and the ICA was reperfused to
produce SAH. Sham-operated rats underwent the same procedure
except the suture was withdrawn without perforation, after feeling
resistance.
Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection
An intracerebroventricular injection procedure was performed, as
reported previously (Chen et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2010). A small
burr hole was drilled into the skull according to the following coordinates
relative to the bregma: 1.5 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral.
Theneedleof10μl Hamilton syringe (Microliter 701; Hamilton Company,
Reno, NV) was stereotactically inserted into the left lateral ventricle
through the burr hole, 4.0 mm below the horizontal plane of the bregma.
Five microliters of HIOC (Vitas-M Laboratory, Narva, Estonia) or
BDNF (ProSpec-Tany Technogene, EastBrunswick, NJ)in vehicle wasinfused
at a rate of 0.5μl/min 3 h after SAH induction, while 500 pmol/5μl
TrkB or scramble siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
were infused at the same rate 24 h before SAH modeling. TrkB siRNA
is a pool of three different siRNA duplexes in order to improve the
knockdown efficiency. All TrkB siRNA sequences are provided in
5′→ 3′orientation: (a) sense, GGAUUCCGGCUUAAAGUUU, antisense,
AAACUUUAAGCCGGAAUCC; (b) sense, GGAUUUGUAUUGCCUCAAU,
antisense, AUUGAGGCAAUACAAAUCC; and (c) sense, CCAUCACAUU
UCUCGAAUC, antisense, GAUUCGAGAAAUGUGAUGG. The syringe was
left in situ for an additional 10 min before slowly removing it. In Experiment
1, the sham group rats were subjected to the same procedure,
without inserting the needle.
Neurological scores
Neurological deficits were evaluated 24 and 72 h after SAH using a
22-point scoring system including a modified Garcia scale and beam
balance test in the outcome study. The modified Garcia assessment
consisted of six tests covering spontaneous activity, spontaneous movement
of four limbs, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception
, and response to whisker stimulation (3–18 points) (Garcia et al.,
1995). For the beam balance test, the rats were placed on a beam to
observe their walking distance within 1 min (0–4 points). The mean
neurologic scores were calculated from two blinded observers' grading.
SAH grade
An 18-point SAH severity grading system was used as previously
described (Sugawara et al., 2008). The basal cistern was divided into
six segments that can be scored from 0 to 3 according to the amount
of subarachnoid blood clot. A total score was calculated by adding the
scores from six segments (0–18 points). Animals receiving a score of
less than 8 were excluded from the study.
Western blots
The protein extracted from the left hemisphere (perforation side)
was used for the Western blot analysis. Equivalent total protein
amounts (30μg) were loaded in each lane of SDS-PAGE gels. After gel
electrophoresis, the protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
, which was then blocked by a blocking buffer for 2 h at room
temperature. The following primary antibodies were diluted to incubate
with the membrane under gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight:
anti-TrkB, anti-phosphorylated TrkB (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), antiphosphorylated
ERK 1/2, anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology
, Danvers, MA), and anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). β-Actin was used as an internal loading control (anti-β-

actin) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Appropriate secondary
antibodies were incubated with the NC membrane for 2 h at room
temperature. Chemiluminescent detection was performed to identify
the immune bands withthe kit (ECL Plus;AmershamBioscience, Arlington
Heights, IL). Data was analyzed by densitometry with ImageJ
software.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence for brain slices was performed onfixed frozen
sections as previously described (Hu et al., 2009). Twenty-four hours
after SAH, rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused
with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and 10% formalin. Rats' brains
were rapidly isolated and postfixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then
in 30% sucrose for 3 days. Coronal brain sections (10μm) were obtained
with the help of cryostat (Leica CM3050S-3-1-1, Bannockburn, IL) and
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Sections
were blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h and incubated at 4 °C
overnight with primary antibodies: anti-phosphorylated TrkB (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (Millipore, Temecula,
CA), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and Texas Redconjugated
secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West
Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature. The colocalization of p-TrkB
with the marker of neuron was examined by afluorescent microscope
(Olympus OX51, Tokyo, Japan).

primary antibody and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody. For
quantitative analyses, the numbers of TUNEL-positive neurons infive
microscope sections (×20), which were selected around the bleeding
site in the subcortex, were averaged per animal.
Statistical analysis
One-wayanalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple
comparisons test was used for different groups' comparison. Chi-square
tests were used for mortality analyses. Data were shown as mean ±
SEM. Pb0.05 was considered statistical difference.
Results
SAH severity score and mortality
SAH grading scores were similar among SAH groups in each time
point of experiments (data not shown). Two animals were excluded
from this study due to mild bleeding (one in TrkB siRNA + SAH
group of Experiment 1, and one in SAH + HIOC low dosage group of Experiment
2). There is no significant difference on mortality among
groups in each experiment (data not shown). No sham-operated animals
died in this study.

Knocking down of TrkB exacerbated neurologic deficits 24 h after SAH
Gene silence of TrkB receptor slightly but significantly decreased the
modified Garcia score 24 h after SAH, when compared with the vehicle
or scramble siRNA group (Fig. 1A). No obvious neurologic deficits were
observed 24 h after siRNA injection, before perforation (data not
shown).
Knocking down of TrkB decreased the expression of p-TrkB and Bcl-2, 24 h
after SAH
The expression of TrkB did not change 24 h after SAH, while it was
downregulated in the TrkB siRNA group (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of
TrkB and the expression of Bcl-2 were reduced 24 h after SAH, and
knocking down of TrkB led to further decrease (Figs. 1D, E).

Administration of HIOC after SAH improved neurologic scores, and TrkB
siRNA abolished the effects
Impaired neurologic outcomes were observed after SAH, and HIOC
(icv injection) attenuated neurobehavioral deficits 24 h after SAH in
both low and high dosage groups (Fig. 2A). High dosage of HIOC administration
significantly improved the neurologic function 48 and 72 h
after SAH, while the low dosage group showed no effects on increasing
neurobehavioral scores compared with the SAH or SAH + vehicle
groups (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the high dosage was selected for the following
studies (Experiments 3 and 4).
TrkB siRNA abolished the therapeutic effects of HIOC treatment,
while scramble siRNA had no impact on modified Garcia scores 24 h
after SAH (Fig. 2C).
HIOC exerts neuroprotection via activation of TrkB/ERK pathway
Western blot analyses showed that TrkB siRNA significantly
decreased TrkB expression (Fig. 3B). The phosphorylation of TrkB and
its downstream effector ERK reduced 24h after SAH.HIOC treatmentincreased
the level of p-TrkB and p-ERK (Figs. 3C, D). The expression
of CC3 increased 24 h after SAH, while HIOC treatment decreased
this pro-apoptosis protein level (Fig. 3E). These effects of HIOC
were prevented by TrkB siRNA, but not affected by scramble siRNA
(Figs. 3C–E).
HIOC treatment attenuated neuronal injury in the subcortex 24 h following
SAH
The expression of p-TrkB was detected in neurons in both shamoperated
and SAH rats (Fig. 4A). The numbers of TUNEL positive
neurons were strikingly increased in the subcortex 24 h after SAH, and
HIOC treatment remarkably reduced neuronal apoptosis (Figs. 4B, C).
HIOC is equally potent as BDNF at 6 h, but more potent 24 h following SAH
There is no notable difference on modified Garcia scores among
vehicle, HIOC and BDNF treatment groups 6 h after SAH (Fig. 5A). The
expression of p-TrkB and p-ERK significantly decreased 6 h after SAH
compared with sham group, while treatment with HIOC or BDNF remarkably
increased the expression of p-TrkB and p-ERK (Figs. 5C, D).
No statistical difference was found upon the phosphorylation level
between the two treatment groups (Figs. 5C, D).
Twenty-four hours after SAH, the HIOC group showed better outcomes
than the BDNF group (Fig. 6A). There is a trend (P N 0.05) that
the level of p-TrkB was higher in the HIOC group than that of the
BDNF group 24 h after SAH (Fig. 6B), and the level of p-ERK was significantly
lower in the BDNF group compared with that in the HIOC group
at 24 h time point (Fig. 6C). The expression of CC3 notably increased
24 h after SAH was induced. HIOC significantly decreased the CC3
level compared with the vehicle group, while BDNF showed no marked
effect on reducing the CC3 expression (Fig. 6D).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated a crucial role of TrkB in early brain
injury after SAH that knocking down TrkB decreased Bcl-2 and aggravated
neurological deficits. HIOC activated the TrkB/ERK pathway and
decreased brain injury especially neuronal apoptosis after SAH. The
therapeutic effect of HIOC was abolished by TrkB siRNA. Furthermore,
the neuroprotective effect of HIOC was comparable to BDNF at 6 h but
more pronounced 24 h after SAH.
TrkB is one of a major class of neurotrophin receptors, as they promote
cell survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity (Boulle et al.,
2012; Obianyo and Ye, 2013). Several studies have demonstrated that
TrkB signaling plays a pivotal role in central nervous system diseases,
such as neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders and ischemia stroke
(Castello et al., 2014; Pandya et al., 2014; Van Kanegan et al., 2014).
Our previous study suggested that inhibition of protein tyrosine

phosphatases could preserve TrkB activation, thus preventing early
brain injury after SAH in rat model (Hasegawa et al., 2011a). As anticipated
, gene silencing of TrkB worsened the outcomes of SAH in this
study (Fig. 1).
NAS was once considered only as the precursor of melatonin from
serotonin.However, recentstudies revealed that NAS could act as anagonist
of TrkB and display neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo
(Jang et al., 2010; Sompol et al., 2011). Meanwhile, Zhou et al. demonstrated
that NAS could also inhibit mitochondrial cell death pathways
and autophagy activation following ischemic insults (Zhou et al.,
2014). As a new derivative of NAS, HIOC has been proven to selectively
phosphorylate TrkB with higher efficiency and is more stable than NAS
(Shen et al., 2012). However, we are not aware of a study on the effects
of HIOC in stroke models. In the present study, we showed that HIOC
had a pro-survival role through initiating TrkB downstream signaling
cascade following SAH in a rat model. Treatment with HIOC 3 h after
SAH attenuated early brain injury, showing a relatively wide therapeutic
time window of HIOC, which made it more clinically relevant.
TrkB is the primary high affinity receptor for BDNF and BDNF–TrkB
axis has been revealed to be neuroprotective involving in various central
nervous system disorders, including ischemic injury (Han and
Holtzman, 2000; Han et al., 2011; Muller et al., 2008; Van Kanegan
et al., 2014), which made BDNF a promising agent for stroke treatment.
Therefore, in the current study, we compared the therapeutic effects of
HIOC with BDNF after SAH. Our data showed that these two treatment
groups exhibited no significant difference on stimulating TrkB phosphorylation
6 h following SAH, while the HIOC group showed improved
neurobehavioral outcomes and exerted a tendency of activating TrkB
more potently than the BDNF group 24 h post-SAH (Figs. 5, 6). It has
been reported that BDNF has poor blood brain barrier penetrability
and short serum half-life, and induces TrkB polyubiquitination and
degradation, and these features made BDNF's clinical application problematic
(Nagahara and Tuszynski, 2011;Shen etal., 2012). From this observation
,it seems that HIOC, asa small compound, is more efficientand
has prolonged effects on activating TrkB and its downstream effector
than BDNF, thus a good candidate for future consideration.
Apoptosis is considered to be one of the most crucial factors that can
cause early brain injury after SAH. Moreover, injured neurons following
SAH may be associated with delayed neurological deterioration and
poor long-term outcome (Sabri et al., 2008). TrkB activation leads to
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is critical for numerous cellular activitiessuchas
survival, proliferation,apoptosis,motility, transcription, metabolism
and differentiation (Ramos, 2008; Roux and Blenis, 2004). A
previous study reported that p-ERK was significantly decreased in the
dentate gyrus in SAH model and elevating its expression prevented
SAH induced apoptosis (Lin et al., 2009). In agreement with this study,
in our study, the level of p-ERK in the left hemisphere (perforation
side) decreased after SAH compared with the sham, and treatment
with HIOC prevented its decrease (Fig. 3). Based on thesefindings, we
speculate that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via activation of TrkB may

result in the subsequent pro-survival signaling cascade, which is the
activation of the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase and its downstream pathway.
The transcriptional factor cAMP-response element binding protein
(CREB) phosphorylation is ribosomal S6 kinase-mediated and facilitates
the neuron survival through increased transcription of pro-survival
genes, such as Bcl2 family members (Anjum and Blenis, 2008). Indeed,
the expression of Bcl-2 was reduced when TrkB was knocked down in
this study (Fig. 1).
However, there are several limitations of this study that need to be
mentioned. First, we did HIOC intracerebroventricular injection only in
our experiments. Intraperitoneal or intravenous injection route should
be compared with intracerebroventricular injection route to assess
blood brain barrier penetrability of HIOC, which might be important
for further clinical application. Second, we cannot exclude that the therapeutic
effects of HIOC are partially from the antidepressant actions
of NAS derivatives. So long-term effects of HIOC on SAH rat need to
be evaluated to see if this treatment is related to antidepressant actions.
Third, serotonin is a well-known platelet agonist with which an
N-acetyl serotonin derivative might compete. The effects of HIOC on
coagulation cascade and platelet activation might affect the results.
Future studies of HIOC on clotting mechanism in vivo should help us
to answer this question.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for thefirst time that
knocking down of TrkB aggravated early brain injury and activation of
TrkB with HIOC attenuated neuronal injury following SAH in a rodent
model. HIOC has the potential to reduce SAH or other stroke injuries.
