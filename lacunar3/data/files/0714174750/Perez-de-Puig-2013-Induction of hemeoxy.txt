Abstract—Hemeoxygenase (HO) is an enzymatic system
that degrades heme. HO-1 is an inducible isoform whereas
HO-2 is constitutive. Stroke strongly induces HO-1 expression
but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated.
Cytokines that are up-regulated after ischemia, like interleukin
(IL)-10, can induce HO-1 gene expression, which is positively
regulated by the transcriptional activator nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and negatively regulated
by the transcriptional repressor breast cancer type 1
susceptibility protein (BRCA1) associated C-terminal helicase
1 (Bach-1). While Nrf2 is activated after ischemia and
drugs promoting Nrf2 activation increase HO-1 and are beneficial
, the involvement of Bach-1 is unknown. Here we
investigated mechanisms involved in HO-1 induction and
evaluated the effects of HO activity inhibition in mouse permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). HO-1
was induced after ischemia in IL-10-deficient mice suggesting
that post-ischemic HO-1 induction was IL-10-independent.
Attenuation of Bach-1 gene repression after ischemia
was associated to enhanced HO-1 induction. Administration
of the HO activity inhibitor zinc proto-porphyrin IX (ZnPP)
i.p. 24 h before pMCAO exacerbated ischemia-induced
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-1b, nitro-oxidative
stress, and the presence of neutrophils at 8 h, and increased
infarct volume at day 4. However, ZnPP did not worsen
ischemic damage when given 30 min before pMCAO. ZnPP
induced HO-1 expression in the cerebral vasculature at
24 h, when it was still detected by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) in plasma. While ZnPP was not
found in brain tissue extracts of controls, it could be
detected after ischemia, supporting that a small fraction of
the injected drug can reach the tissue following blood–brain
barrier breakdown. The deleterious effect of inhibiting HO
activity in ischemia became apparent in the presence of
ZnPP-induced HO-1, which is known to exert effects
independent of its enzymatic activity. In conclusion, HO-1
induction after ischemia was associated to down-regulation
of transcriptional repressor Bach-1, and induction of
HO-1 when HO enzymatic activity was inhibited was
related to worst outcome after brain ischemia.

INTRODUCTION
Hemeoxygenase (HO) is an enzymatic system (Ryter
et al., 2006) responsible for heme degradation and
formation of the a-isomer of biliverdin, which is
converted to bilirubin-IX (Tenhunen et al., 1969). The
ferrous form Fe(II) and CO are released in a NADPH,
O
2
and cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent reaction
(Tenhunen et al., 1969; Ryter et al., 2006). Two HO
isoenzymes have been described: an inducible form,
HO-1, and a constitutive isoform, HO-2 (Cruse and
Maines, 1988). Both isoenzymes metabolize heme, but
only HO-1 translocates to the nucleus in a manner
independent of its enzymatic activity (Linnenbaum et al.,
2012) and activates transcription factors (Lin et al.,
2007). HO-1 is a member of the heat-shock protein
(HSP) family, also known as HSP-32 (32-kDa HSP),
since it responds to hyperthermia (Raju and Maines,
1994) due to the presence of elements of response to
heat shock in the HO-1 gene (Shibahara et al., 1987).
However, HO-1 does not have chaperone activity, which
is a hallmark of most HSPs (Ryter et al., 2006). Besides
heat stress, HO-1 is induced by a number of stimuli,
including sodium arsenite (Keyse and Tyrrell, 1989;
Fauconneau et al., 2002), peroxynitrite (Foresti et al.,
1999), certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as

tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1a (IL-
1a)( Terry et al., 1999), and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
such as IL-10 (Lee and Chau, 2002), among others
(Ryter et al., 2006).
The regulation of HO-1 gene expression is complex
since it is controlled by the transcriptional activator
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and by
the transcriptional repressor breast cancer type 1
susceptibility protein (BRCA1) associated C-terminal
helicase1 (Bach-1), a nuclear transcription regulatory
protein belonging to the basic region/leucine zipper motif
(bZIP) family (Srisook et al., 2005; Igarashi and Sun,
2006). Expression of HO-1 is induced in the brain after
transient global ischemia (Paschen et al., 1994; Takeda
et al., 1994; Geddes et al., 1996; Imaizumi et al., 2003),
transient (Koistinaho et al., 1996; Nimura et al., 1996)
and permanent (Geddes et al., 1996; Fu et al., 2006)
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, and in cortical
photothrombosis (Bidmon et al., 2001). Furthermore, a
prolonged expression of HO-1 was reported in the
postmortem human brain of stroke patients (Beschorner
et al., 2000). Several lines of evidence suggest that the
induction of HO-1 protects neurons against transient
forebrain ischemia (Takizawa et al., 1998). Furthermore,
over-expression of HO-1 in transgenic mice is protective
against permanent MCA occlusion (Panahian et al.,
1999), whereas reduced HO-1 expression is associated
with more severe neurodegeneration after transient
ischemia induced by cortical compression in diabetic
rats (Moreira et al., 2007). Moreover, various
pharmacological treatments that exert beneficial effects
against ischemic damage are associated with increased
HO-1 expression (Cervera et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2006;
Pereira et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2006; Saleem et al.,
2008). In contrast, some protective treatments were
related to repression of HO-1 expression (Collino et al.,
2006), and several lines of evidence support that HO-1
expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons after transient
forebrain ischemia might be harmful (Matsuoka et al.,
1998, 1999).
Zinc proto-porphyrin IX (ZnPP) is a competitive
inhibitor of HO (Verma et al., 1993) that inhibits HO
activity in vivo (Masini et al., 2003). ZnPP is a
naturally occurring compound that is produced instead
of heme under conditions of iron deficiency
(Metzgeroth et al., 2007). Increased levels of ZnPP
due to alterations of iron metabolism have been
associated to the severity of chronic inflammation
(Hastka et al., 1993). Treatment with ZnPP has
negative effects in several inflammatory conditions,
such as acute inflammation induced by carrageenan,
where it enhances neutrophil rolling and adhesion on
the endothelium and migration (Freitas et al., 2006).
However, benefits of ZnPP were found in transient, but
not permanent, MCA occlusion in rats (Kadoya et al.,
1995; Zhao et al., 1996). Here we investigated
mechanisms underlying HO-1 induction after
permanent ischemia in mice and studied whether
pharmacological inhibition of HO enzymatic activity
with ZnPP affected the expression of pro-inflammatory
mediators and altered the outcome of brain ischemia.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Animal experimentation was conducted with the approval
of the Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona
(CEEA) according to the local roles and in compliance
with the European legislation. Adult male FVB/NJ mice
were obtained from Charles River (Lyon, France).
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) knock-out mice (The Jackson
Laboratory) in the C57BL/10 background were keep
under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in the
animal house of the School of Medicine of the University
of Barcelona. Under SPF conditions signs of
inflammation did not became apparent in IL-10 KO
mice, in agreement with precious reports (Kullberg
et al., 1998). These mice were maintained as a
heterozygous colony and each animal was genotyped to
select wild type (WT, +/+) and knock out (KO, /)
mice.
Brain ischemia
Permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
(pMCAO) was carried out under isoflurane anesthesia in
30% O
2
and 70% N
2
O in adult (15–17 weeks old) male
mice, following a described surgical procedure (Liesz
et al., 2009). In brief, after craniotomy, the distal portion
of the MCA was occluded by cauterization. Flow
obstruction was visually verified and the fall in cortical
blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler system
(Perimed AB, Ja¨rfalla, Sweden). This procedure caused
a consistent infarction restricted to the parietal cortex
and did not cause mortality during the length of the
study (the maximum was 4 days).
Drug administration
Zinc proto-porphyrin IX (ZnPP) (Sigma–Aldrich) was
administered i.p. at the dose of 30 mg/kg in 0.2 mL of
50 mM sodium carbonate solution. Control mice
received the vehicle. The dose of ZnPP was selected
according to results of previous studies showing HO
inhibition in vivo (Downard et al., 1997; Wei et al.,
2003). ZnPP was administered once either 24 h or
30 min prior to the induction of ischemia.
Evaluation of brain damage and histology
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and were
sacrificed 4 days after the induction of ischemia to
evaluate infarct volume. The brain was removed and
sliced in 1-mm-thick coronal sections that were then
stained with 1% solution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) for 10 min at 37C. Sections were immersed
overnight in a 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer
and washed in this buffer. Images of the TTC brain
sections were processed with NIH image software. The
infarcted area was measured as the pale zone in each
section. A correction for edema was made by
multiplying the measured infarcted area by the ratio of
the contralateral to the ipsilateral hemisphere areas.

The infarcted areas of all sections were integrated to
calculate infarct volume.
Behavioral test
Three days after pMCAO, the adhesion/removal tape test
that evaluates sensorimotor deficits was carried out as
described (Bouet et al., 2009). In brief, an adhesive
tape was placed in one of the forelimbs. The animal
tries to remove the tape, and the duration of time till
contact with the mouth and time to tape removal, until a
maximum of 2 min, was measured. Animals were
trained in this task 2 days prior to ischemia.
Western blotting
The ischemic tissue was visually identified within the
parietal cortex by its differential macroscopic features
and it was dissected out (Fig. 1A). Tissue was
homogenized in radio-immunoassay precipitation (RIPA)
buffer, centrifuged at 2000g, and the supernatant was
used for protein determination as above. Thirty-lg of 
protein was loaded in polyacrylamide gels and subjected
to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Proteins were then
transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane.
Following blockade, membranes were incubated
overnight at 4C with mouse monoclonal antibodies
against HO-1 (#ADI-OSA-110R, Stressgen, Enzo Life
Sciences, Lausen Switzerland) diluted 1:1000;
nitrotyrosine (#ab7048; Abcam Limited, Cambridge, UK)
diluted 1:1000; myeloperoxidase (MPO) (#M1464,
Pelicluster, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) diluted 1:500;
and Bach-1 (#MCA2958Z, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK)
diluted 1:500, followed by incubation with the
corresponding peroxidase-linked secondary antibody
(Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway, NJ, USA). The
reaction was developed with a chemiluminiscence
method based on the luminol reaction. Membranes were
reprobed with antibodies against b-tubulin (T4026,

protein loading in each lane. The optical density of the

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted from the cortex with guanidinium
thiocyanate. Two lg of RNA were used for cDNA
synthesis using AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(#12328-040, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two llof
cDNA synthesis reaction were used in 25ll real-time
RT-PCR reaction with FAM-labeled Taqman Gene
Expression Assays for TNF-a (NM_013693; Cat.
#4331182), IL-1b (NM_008361; Cat. #4331182), HO-1
(NM_010442.2; Cat. #4331182), and b-actin
(Mn00607939_s1; Cat. #4331182) (Invitrogen). The
amplification conditions were: 10 min at 95C followed
by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95C, 1 min at 60C. CT values
were analyzed using the 2-DDCT method.
Determination of ZnPP concentration in plasma and
brain
The concentration of ZnPP in plasma and brain tissue
was evaluated by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection.
ZnPP (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to
mice. Blood samples were taken under isoflurane
anesthesia at different time points (30 min, 1 h, 6 h and
24 h) after ZnPP administration. At each time, animals
were bled (2 mL) throughout the cava vein, and plasma
was obtained using citrate as anticoagulant. After
centrifugation (900g for 5 min) supernatants were
frozen. To study the brain tissue, animals were perfused
through the heart with saline to remove any blood
remaining in the brain vessels, and brain tissue samples
(hemispheres or cortical regions) were dissected out
and frozen until further analysis. The method used for
ZnPP extraction from biological samples and detection
was an adaptation of a previously published method
(Roh et al., 2000). Briefly, plasma (100lL) and brain
tissue (20–200 mg) were deproteinized in 0.5–1 mL of
ethyl acetate/acetic acid (4/1) vol, after adding 100lLof
water to plasma or brain samples. Then the samples
were sonicated for 30 s with an ultrasound microprobe
(Labsonic M; Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany),
followed by centrifugation for 4 min at 12,000g
(Centrifuge 5415 D; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
Aliquots (2–60lL) of the supernatant were injected into
the HPLC system (Water Associates, Milford, MA, USA)
made of a 600E Pump, a 717 plus Auto sampler, and a
2475 fluorimeter. A reverse-phase Gemini-C18, 5lm,
2504.6 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA,
USA) was used. The mobile phase was methanol/acetic
acid/H
2
O (78/8/14 by vol), which was run with an
isocratic regular flow rate of 1 mL/min. For ZnPP
detection, the fluorimeter was adjusted to 405 nm Ex/
600 nm Em. Quantification was performed by external
calibration. ZnPP showed a linear response in the range
of 250 pg–10.6 ng, and the detection limit was 200 pg.
The recovery of the extraction from plasma and brain
samples was near 100%.
Immunofluorescence
Mice received either ZnPP or the vehicle through i.p.
administration as described above. Twenty-four hours
later, the mice were anesthetized and perfused through
the heart with heparinized saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The
brain was removed and following 4-h incubation with
this fixative, were transferred to a phosphate buffer
solution and kept at 4 overnight. The following day, the
brains were cut in a vibratome in 30-lm-thick sections
that were crioprotected in a solution containing glycerol
and were kept at 20C until further
immunofluorescence. Sections were rinsed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were incubated
with the blocking solution (0.1 M glycine, 0.1 M lysine,
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 15% normal goat
serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100), for 3 h at
room temperature. Following washing, sections were
incubated free-floating overnight at 4C under gentle
agitation with mouse monoclonal HO-1 (#ADI-OSA-
110R, Stressgen) that was used 1:200, followed by the
secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488,
#A11017, Invitrogen) diluted 1:500, 1 h at room
temperature. Double immunofluorescence was
performed by overnight incubation at 4C with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody against glucose transporter-1 (Glut-
1) to stain the blood vessels (#07-1401, EMD Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) diluted 1:300, followed
by 1 h incubation at room temperature with a goat antirabbit
secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 546, #A11071,
Invitrogen) diluted 1:500. Nuclei were counterstained
with Hoechst (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) diluted
1:20,000. Immunostaining controls included omission of
primary antibodies. Sections were mounted and
observed under the fluorescence microscope (Leica).
Statistical analyses
Group differences were tested with one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc Bonferroni
test. Two-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of two
factors (e.g. treatment by time). Differences between
two groups were analyzed with the Student’s t-test after
testing for normality. Statistical analyses were carried
out with GraphPad Prism software.
RESULTS
Induction of HO-1 expression after ischemia
The ischemic cortex was dissected out (Fig. 1A) to examine
mRNA and protein expression. HO-1 mRNA was induced in
I. Pe´rez-de-Puig et al./Neuroscience 243 (2013) 22–32 25
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1230268346)
the ischemic cortex 4 and 8 h after pMCAO (Fig. 1B), and
was followed by expression of HO-1 protein (Fig. 1C).
HO-1 is induced by the action of IL-10 in murine
macrophages (Lee and Chau, 2002). By using IL-10
deficient mice, we examined whether HO-1 induction in
the ischemic brain was dependent on IL-10 since brain
ischemia up-regulates IL-10 expression (Famakin et al.,
2012). In IL-10 KO mice, we observed induction of HO-1
expression 24 h post-ischemia, but to a lower extent than
in corresponding wild-type mice (Fig. 1D, E). Overall,
these results pointed to the presence of triggers other
than IL-10 for post-ischemic HO-1 induction.

(8.0.0.2542,878896455 PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL)
The induction of HO-1 gene expression is regulated
by the transcriptional activator Nrf2 and by the
transcriptional repressor Bach-1 (Srisook et al., 2005;
Igarashi and Sun, 2006). The involvement of Nrf2 in
HO-1 induction after brain ischemia has been previously
demonstrated (Yang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011).
However, it is unknown whether Bach-1 participates in
post-ischemic HO-1 up-regulation. We evaluated Bach-1
expression 8 h after pMCAO and detected that the
content of Bach-1 decreased in the ischemic tissue
(Fig. 1F, G). This result suggests that down-regulation
or degradation of the HO-1 gene repressor Bach-1
contributes to HO-1 induction after ischemia.
ZnPP administration enhances ischemia-induced
HO-1 expression and Bach-1 degradation
Besides inhibiting HO activity, ZnPP has also been
reported to promote HO-1 gene expression (Yang et al.,
2001). ZnPP administration to naı¨ve non-ischemic mice
increased HO-1 mRNA expression after 24 h, but not
after 30 min or 2 h (Fig. 2A), as well as expression of
the protein (Fig. 2B, C). Mice receiving ZnPP 24 h prior
to pMCAO also showed enhanced induction of HO-1
mRNA (Fig. 2D) and protein (Fig. 2E, F) in the ischemic
tissue compared to mice that received the vehicle.
Moreover, ischemia-induced down-regulation of Bach-1
expression was further exacerbated in mice treated with
ZnPP 24 h before pMCAO (Fig. 2G, H), suggesting that
ZnPP might promote Bach-1 degradation facilitating the
enhancement of HO-1 expression observed after
ischemia in ZnPP-treated mice.
Detection of ZnPP in plasma and brain tissue
HPLC was used to quantify the concentration of ZnPP in
plasma and brain tissue. ZnPP was identified as a
chromatographic peak at 23.8-min retention time. The
ZnPP response curve after HPLC separation and
fluorimetric detection (Exc: 405 nm/Em: 600 nm) showed
detection within the range of 250 pg–10.6 ng. The
response had excellent linearity characteristics
(r= 0.9995) (Fig. 3A). A basal content of ZnPP in
plasma and brain of untreated mice was non-detectable.
Fig. 3. Measurement of ZnPP in plasma and brain using HPLC and fluorimetric detection. (A) ZnPP response curve after HPLC separation and
fluorimetric detection (Exc: 405 nm, Em: 600 nm) in the range 250 pg–10.6 ng. The response shows excellent linearity within this concentration
range (r2= 0.9995). (B) No basal levels of ZnPP are detected in plasma or brain of control mice. Following ZnPP i.p. administration (30 mg/kg) to
control mice, the drug is detected by HPLC in plasma but not in brain tissue. The retention time is 23.8 min. The images show representative
chromatograms of samples obtained from control mice before (basal) and 6 h after ZnPP administration. (C) The plasma time course curve shows a
peak at about 6 h and a slow clearance with levels remaining still high after 24 h. (D) Two hours after ischemia, traces of ZnPP (administered 8 h
before ischemia) are detected in brain tissue at an estimated concentration of 100 pg/mg of brain tissue, suggesting that post-ischemic alterationsin
the permeability of the blood–brain barrier allow some extravasation of ZnPP from blood to brain parenchyma.

( 8.0.0.2542.272468664 PDF Extractor SDK EVALUATION)
However, after ZnPP administration to control mice the
plasmatic levels of this compound were high enough to
be determined by HPLC (Fig. 3B).
The time-dependent changes in the plasma
concentration of ZnPP in mice after administration of the
drug showed a peak at about 6-h post-administration and
then the concentration slowly declined. Nevertheless, the
elimination rate was slow since plasma ZnPP levels were
still high 24 h after administration (Fig. 3C).
ZnPP was not detected in the brain tissue following
administration to control mice, suggesting that any effects
in brain tissue could be mediated through the action of
ZnPP to brain vasculature (Fig. 3B). However, when mice
were subjected to ischemia after ZnPP administration,
ZnPP traces (around 100 pg/mg tissue) were detected in
the ischemic cortex (Fig. 3D). This finding suggested that
very small amounts of the drug might reach the brain
parenchyma when the permeability of the blood–brain
barrier is altered after ischemia.
Systemic administration of ZnPP induced HO-1
expression in the brain vasculature
Immunofluorescence disclosed the presence of HO-1
immunostaining in the cerebral vasculature 24 h after
administration to control mice (Fig. 4). This finding
supported that ZnPP-induced stress in the brain vessels
and promoted vascular HO-1 induction.
ZnPP exacerbates ischemia-induced brain
inflammation
Pro-inflammatory effects of ZnPP have been reported
(Freitas et al., 2006 ) and for this reason we examined
whether this compound enhanced cytokine induction in
ischemia. pMCAO induced the expression of IL-1b and
TNF-a mRNA at 4 h (Fig. 5A, B). Administration of ZnPP
24 h prior to pMCAO significantly increased the postischemic
expression of IL-1b (Fig. 5A) and TNF-a (Fig. 5B)
mRNA. Furthermore, ZnPP-pretreated mice showed higher
expression of myeloperoxidase in the brain 8 h after
pMCAO (Fig. 5C, D), which supports that ZnPP promoted
the recruitment of neutrophils possibly by inducing
inflammation at the level of the endothelium. In addition,
ZnPP increased ischemia-induced protein nitrotyrosination
(Fig. 5E, F), indicating higher formation of peroxynitrite; a
compound that nitrates proteins via an irreversible chemical
process that often causes loss of protein function (Guix
et al., 2009). Altogether, these results suggest that
pretreatment with ZnPP 24 h before pMCAO exacerbates
brain inflammation and nitro-oxidative stress.
ZnPP worsens brain damage when administered 24 h,
but not 30 min, before pMCAO
Administration of the HO inhibitor ZnPP 24 h before
pMCAO did not affect the drop in cerebral blood flow

induced by ischemia that was 88.4 ± 1.5 (n= 8) and
89.7 ± 1.6 (n= 9) (expressed as % of baseline,
mean ± SEM) in the vehicle and ZnPP groups,
respectively. However, treatment with ZnPP 24 h prior
to pMCAO (n= 20) caused a significant (p< 0.01)
increase in infarct volume at day 4 (Fig. 6A), compared
to the control group receiving the vehicle (n= 19). The
behavioral test (Fig. 6B) showed a trend to a worst
performance of the contralateral forelimb at day 3 in
mice treated with ZnPP. In contrast, administration of
ZnPP 30 min before pMCAO (n= 8) did not exacerbate
infarct volume versus the vehicle group (n= 12), as
evaluated 4 days later (Fig. 6C).
DISCUSSION
HO-1 is highly induced in the brain after ischemia but
whether it exerts beneficial or detrimental roles is not
well understood. HO-1 induction is positively regulated
by the transcription factor Nrf2, and negatively regulated
by the transcriptional repressor Bach-1 (Srisook et al.,
2005; Igarashi and Sun, 2006). Activation of the Nrf2
system has been previously reported in brain ischemia
(Yang et al., 2001; Li et al., 2011) and antioxidant drugs
enhance ischemia-induced HO-1 by activating the redoxsensitive
heterodimers of Nrf2/antioxidant responsive
element (ARE) pathway (Li et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2011).
Here we additionally detected Bach-1 down-regulation
after brain ischemia, suggesting that this effect might
contribute to promote the induction of HO-1 in this
condition. Pretreatment with ZnPP 24 h before pMCAO
further reduced Bach-1 expression and increased the
expression of HO-1 in the ischemic brain, in agreement
with previous results showing that ZnPP induces the
expression of HO-1 in cellular systems (Yang et al.,
2001). We also tested whether IL-10 was involved in postischemic
HO-1 up-regulation, since this cytokine promotes
HO-1 expression in macrophages (Lee and Chau, 2002;
Ricchetti et al., 2004). We detected HO-1 up-regulation in
the ischemic brain of IL-10 deficient mice, but to a lower
degree than in the wild type. This result suggests that
post-ischemic up-regulation of HO-1 expression can take
place in the absence of IL-10 and therefore independently
of this factor. The lower degree of HO-1 induction in IL-10
KO mice than in the WT might be the consequence of
alterations secondary to IL-10 deficiency.

Administration of the HO competitive inhibitor ZnPP
24 h prior to ischemia exacerbated the lesion at day 4,
supporting that HO activity was beneficial in this
condition in agreement with previous findings (Takizawa
et al., 1998; Panahian et al., 1999; Cervera et al., 2004;
Pereira et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006;
Moreira et al., 2007; Saleem et al., 2008). Negative
effects of ZnPP have been previously described, as for
instance it can induce cell death in cell cultures (Yang
et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2012). In our study, ZnPP
treatment 24 h prior to pMCAO promoted ischemiainduced
nitro-oxidative stress and inflammation, and
increased the presence of neutrophils in the ischemic
tissue. Pro-inflammatory effects of ZnPP, such as
exacerbation of LPS-induced selectin expression
(Tushar et al., 2000) and neutrophil activation (Freitas
et al., 2006) have been reported. The pro-inflammatory
effects of ZnPP are in line with the anti-inflammatory
properties of the HO enzymatic system (Otterbein et al.,
2000). HO-1 prevents the induction of TNF-a, vascular
cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) under
several challenges (Wagener et al., 1999; Soares et al.,
2004; Seldon et al., 2007). Likewise, HO-2 also exerts
beneficial effects since its activation prevents neuronal
apoptosis (Chen et al., 2005), and deletion of HO-2
gene exacerbates stroke damage (Namiranian et al.,
2005). Therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of both
HO-1 and HO-2 activity by ZnPP contributed to the
deleterious effect of this compound in brain ischemia.
ZnPP was detected in plasma 24 h post-administration
showing that the compound suffered a slow clearance
from the circulation. Furthermore, systemic administration
of ZnPP-induced HO-1 expression in brain vessels.
Therefore, plasma ZnPP could affect the cerebrovascular
endothelium inducing inflammation and attracting
circulating leukocytes after the ischemic challenge.
Leakage of the blood–brain barrier after ischemia
facilitated the extravasation of ZnPP from the vascular
compartment to the brain parenchyma where it could
directly affect brain cells.
In contrast to the effects of administration of ZnPP
24 h prior to ischemia, treatment 30 min before ischemia
did not exacerbate infarct volume. Likewise, a previous
study showed that administration of ZnPP 30 min prior
to permanent brain ischemia in rats did not modify
infarct volume at 24 h (Kadoya et al., 1995). A main
difference between the administration of ZnPP at these
two different time points is that ZnPP increases HO-1
expression in the brain vasculature 24 h postadministration
, but not after 30 min. Therefore, HO-1
was expressed in brain vessels when ischemia was
performed 24 h after ZnPP treatment, while it was
absent at 30 min. This difference might be relevant
since HO-1 can exert actions that are independent of its
enzymatic activity, like the activation of transcription
factors (Lin et al., 2007; Linnenbaum et al., 2012). The
latter property is not shared by HO-2, which does not
seem to be involved in ICAM-1 induction (Wagener
et al., 1999) either. Therefore, our study suggests that,
in the absence of HO activity, HO-1 exerts detrimental
effects.
Fig. 6. ZnPP worsens the outcome of pMCAO when administered 24 h, but not 30 min, prior to ischemia. (A) Mice receiving ZnPP (n= 20) 24 h
prior to pMCAO show larger infarct volume at day 4 post-ischemia than the mice receiving the vehicle (n= 19) (⁄⁄p< 0.01). (B) Using the behavior
adhesion-removal tape test, mice treated with ZnPP 24 h prior to pMCAO show a non-significant trend for the contralateral forelimb to longer time for
contact and removal of the tape, which are signs of a worst neurological function. (C) However, administration of ZnPP (n= 8) 30 min before
pMCAO does not increase infarct volume at day 4 versus the vehicle group (n= 12).

Altogether these results show that the induction of
HO-1 expression after ischemia takes place
independently of IL-10, and they suggest that the
attenuation of HO-1 gene expression after Bach-1
degradation contributes to HO-1 induction. Finally, the
results are compatible with a negative effect of HO-1
expression in the ischemic brain in the absence of HO
activity.
