Abstract
Introduction: Despite its high incidence, nerve fiber (axon and myelin) damage after cerebral infarct has not yet
been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate white matter repair after adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) administration in an experimental model of subcortical stroke. Furthermore, we
aimed to analyze the ADMSC secretome and whether this could be implicated in this repair function.
Methods: An animal model of subcortical ischemic stroke with white matter affectation was induced in rats by
injection of endothelin-1. At 24 hours, 2 × 106 ADMSC were administered intravenously to the treatment group.
Functional evaluation, lesion size, fiber tract integrity, cell death, proliferation, white matter repair markers (Olig-2,
NF, and MBP) and NogoA were all studied after sacrifice (7 days and 28 days). ADMSC migration and implantation
in the brain as well as proteomics analysis and functions of the secretome were also analyzed.
Results: Neither ADMSC migration nor implantation to the brain was observed after ADMSC administration. In
contrast, ADMSC implantation was detected in peripheral organs. The treatment group showed a smaller functional
deficit, smaller lesion area, less cell death, more oligodendrocyte proliferation, more white matter connectivity and
higher amounts of myelin formation. The treated animals also showed higher levels of white matter-associated
markers in the injured area than the control group. Proteomics analysis of the ADMSC secretome identified 2,416
proteins, not all of them previously described to be involved in brain plasticity.
Conclusions: White matter integrity in subcortical stroke is in part restored by ADMSC treatment; this is mediated
by repair molecular factors implicated in axonal sprouting, remyelination and oligodendrogenesis. These findings
are associated with improved functional recovery after stroke.
Introduction
White matter injury and the mechanisms of nerve fiber
(axon and myelin) repair have seldom been investigated
in translational stroke research [1, 2], despite the fact
that blood supply disruption also compromises whole
axons and fibers and therefore brain connectivity. Even
though relevant, white matter injury in stroke has not
been extensively studied in the past due to the intrinsic
difficulties associated with animal models; for instance,
the fact that the rodent brain has substantially less white
matter than higher mammals or humans [3, 4]. However,
not only are up to 25 % of ischemic strokes in humans
subcortical [1], but cortical infarcts also produce white
matter injury. The high incidence of such damage motivates
the search for an effective therapy that would enhance
the mechanisms underlying the repair of damaged
nerve fibers after any kind of stroke.
Stem cell therapy has demonstrated its efficacy in cortical
stroke and may have a positive effect on subcortical
lesions. In this regard, preclinical studies indicate that
adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) are a
promising new therapy for subcortical stroke that could
promote recovery by improving the global brain repair
mechanisms [5–7]. Trophic factor release, paracrine
interactions and immunomodulatory effects have been

suggested as the main functional mechanisms involved
in ADMSC therapy [8, 9]. In this regard, stem cells are
known to have paracrine effects on neurogenesis, gliogenesis
, synaptogenesis, vasculogenesis and immunomodulation.
However, there is little evidence whether stem
cell administration can promote oligodendrogenesis and
white matter fiber repair when axonal tract integrity has
been compromised.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the
therapeutic effects (improvement of functional deficits
and enhancement of white matter fiber repair) of the
intravenous administration of ADMSC in rats submitted
to subcortical stroke with white matter injury.
Methods
Ethics statement
The procedure was carried out at our Cerebrovascular
and Neuroscience Research Laboratory, La Paz University
Hospital, Madrid, Spain. All experiments were designed
to minimize animal suffering in compliance with,
and approved by, our medical school’s Ethical Committee
of La Paz University Hospital for the Care and Use of Animals
in Research according to the Spanish and European
Union rules (86/609/CEE, 2003/65/CE, 2010/63/EU, RD
1201/2005 and RD53/2013).
Animals and surgery
A total of 72 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 200–
250 g (Charles River Laboratories, France) were used. In
all animals, the femoral artery was cannulated during
surgery and induction of cerebral ischemia to allow continuous
monitoring of physiological parameters including
blood glucose levels, blood gases and blood pressure
(Omicron ALTEA Monitor; RGB Medical Devices,
Madrid, Spain). Cranial and body temperature were monitored
and maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. Male Sprague–
Dawley rats (200–250 g) were anesthetized using 3.5 %
isoflurane in 2 L/minute oxygen and given meloxicam
2 mg/kg for analgesia. To provoke white matter injury,
subcortical stroke was induced by injection of 1 μL
endothelin-1 (ET-1; Calbiochem, Germany) (0.25 μg/μL)
withtheuseofaSYR5μL Hamilton syringe (Tecknokroma,
Barcelona, Spain) into the striatum using stereotactic
references (+0.4 mm AP, +3.5 mm L, + 6 mm DV from
bregma) as previously described [10].
After 24 hours, the treatment group received intravenously
(i.v.) 2 × 106 ADMSC in 1 ml of saline solution
(n = 24) by the tail vein. Dose was determined based on
previous studies [8, 9]. In the control (n = 24) and
sham-operation (n = 24) groups, only saline solution was
i.v. administered via the tail vein. Rats were sacrificed at
24 hours (n = 4 in each group for comparative anatomical
analysis of the lesion in fresh tissue and to analyze
ADMSC distribution), 7 days (n = 10 in each group) or
28 days (n = 10 in each group) after treatment for cell
death and proliferation analysis and immunohistochemistry
, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies.
Cell culture protocol
ADMSC obtained from allogeneic adipose tissue of
Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were cultured. The adipose
tissue was digested with collagenase (Sigma Aldrich,
Madrid, Spain) and incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO
2
.Onthe
third pass, the cell cultures were divided into three groups:
1) 1.0 × 105 ADMSC for characterization, 2) 1.5 × 106
ADMSC for proteomics analysis of the culture supernatant
, and 3) 42 × 106 ADMSC for the treatment of rats.
For characterization, ADMSC were trypsinized and labeled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin
(PE)- or Alexa 647-conjugated primary antibodies. The
cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 4 °C in the dark
with the following antibodies: CD90-FITC (AbD Serotec,
Oxford, UK), CD29-PE (AbD Serotec), CD45-PE (AbD
Serotec) and CD11b-PE (AbD Serotec). Matched isotype
controls were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA,
USA). Flow cytometry analysis of CD90+/CD29+/CD45–/
CD11b– cells was performed using a FACScalibur cytometer
and CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson,
Madrid, Spain). For ADMSC treatment, ADMSC with
>95 % viability were administered i.v. The dose, route
and time of administration were based on previously
reported data [9, 11].
Proteomics data analysis
For proteomic analysis of cell culture supernants,
ADMSC were cultured overnight with a free fetal bovine
serum/protein culture medium. After 24 hours, cell supernatants
were collected and the protein content was analyzed
as follows. Proteins were digested using the filter
aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol [12]. Briefly,
samples were dissolved in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.5, 4 %
SDS and 50 mM DTT, boiled for 10 minutes and then
centrifuged. Protein concentration in the supernatant was
measured by the Direct Detect® Spectrometer (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Approximately 50 μg of protein was
diluted in 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), and
loaded onto 30 kDa centrifugal filter devices (FASP
Protein Digestion Kit, Expedeon, Knoxville, TN, USA).
The denaturation buffer was replaced by washing three
times with UA. Proteins were later alkylated using 50 mM
iodoacetamide in UA for 20 minutes in the dark, and the
excess alkylation reagents were eliminated by washing
three times with UA and three additional times with 50
mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were digested
overnight at 37 °C with modified trypsin (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
at 40:1 protein to trypsin (w/w) ratio. The resulting
peptides were eluted by centrifugation with 50 mM

ammonium bicarbonate (twice) and 0.5 M sodium
chloride. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to a
final concentration of 1 % and the peptides were finally
desalted onto C18 Oasis-HLB cartridges and dried-down
for further analysis.
Peptides were loaded into the LC-MS/MS liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry system for on-line
desalting onto C18 cartridges and analyzing by LC-MS/
MS using a C-18 reversed phase nano-column (75 μm
internal diameter × 50 cm, 2 μm particle size, Acclaim
PepMap RSLC, 100 C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) in a continuous acetonitrile gradient
consisting of 0–30 % B in 180 minutes, 50–90 % B in 3
minutes (B = 90 % acetonitrile, 0.5 % formic acid). A flow
rate of 200 nL/minute was used to elute peptides from the
RP nano-column to an emitter nanospray needle for real
time ionization and peptide fragmentation on an Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An
enhanced FT-resolution Fourier- Transform spectrum
(resolution = 35,000) followed by the MS/MS spectra from
the most intense 15 parent ions were analyzed along the
chromatographic run. Dynamic exclusion was set at 30
seconds.
For peptide identification, all spectra were analyzed
with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.0.29; Thermo
Fisher Scientific) using SEQUEST-HT (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). For database searching on the Uniprot database
containing all sequences from humans (6 March 2013),
parameters were selected as follows: trypsin digestion with
two maximum missed cleavage sites, precursor and fragment
mass tolerances of 600 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively
, carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed modification
and methionine oxidation as dynamic modifications.
Peptide identification was validated using the probability
ratio method [13] with an additional filtering for
precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm. False discovery
rate (FDR) was calculated using inverted databases and
the refined method [14]. For the study of the biological
functions of identified proteins, gene onthology analysis
was performed using the GOrilla (Gene Ontology
Enrichment Analysis and Visualization) research tool [15].
Biodistribution analysis
For identification of donor cells, ADMSC were labeled
with DiI (Celltracker CM-DiI, Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain)
prior to administration and stained with CD90, and possible
migration and implantation were analyzed using immunofluorescence.
Biodistribution of labeled ADMSC
with DiI 24 hours after i.v. administration was analyzed
using immunofluorescence techniques in both control
and treated animals. Cryosections (10 μm thick) of 
brain, kidney, liver, lung and spleen were counterstained
with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and analyzed
by immunofluorescence staining (n = 4 per group).
Functional evaluation
Functional evaluation was performed in all animals by a
blinded observer before surgery and after 1, 3, 7, 14 and
28 days. Motor performance was evaluated using the
beam walking and rotarod tests and Rogers’ functional
scale. The beam walking test measured the ability of rats
to walk along a wooden beam (2.5 × 2.5 × 80 cm).
Scores were assigned as follows: 0, traversed the beam
with no foot slip; 1, traversed with grasping of the lateral
side of the beam; 2, difficulty crawling along the beam
but able to traverse; 3, required >10 seconds to traverse
the beam because of difficulty with walking; 4, unable to
traverse the beam; 5, unable to move the body or any
limb on the beam; and 6, unable to stay on the beam for
>10 seconds [16]. The rotarod test measured the latency
to fall from a rotating cylinder [9]. A variant of Rogers’
functional scale was used to assign scores as follows: 0,
no functional deficit; 1, failure to extend forepaw fully;
2, decreased grip of forelimb while tail gently pulled; 3,
spontaneous movement in all directions, contralateral
circling only if pulled by the tail; 4, circling; 5, walking
only when stimulated; 6, unresponsive to stimulation
with a depressed level of consciousness; and 7, dead
(n = 10 per group) [17].
In vivo magnetic resonance imaging and tractography
Lesion size was analyzed after 1, 7 and 28 days by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) using a 7-Tesla horizontal
bore magnet (Bruker Pharmascan, Ettlingen, Germany)
and T2 maps (RARE 8 T2, 180° flip angle, three averages)
as previously described [9]. The lesion area was expressed
as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere, after correcting
for brain edema. For tractography, diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) was performed after 1, 7 and 28 days using
a spin-echo single-shot echo-planar imaging pulse sequence
with the following parameters: TR/TE, 5000/35
ms; signal average, 10; 30 non-collinear diffusion gradients
with diffusion weighting of b = 1,000 s/mm2 and b =
0 s/mm 2; and field of view 3.5 × 3.5 cm. A total of
496 slices were evaluated from data acquired in 30
directions. The images were obtained using medInria
(Inria, France), a multi-platform medical image processing
and visualization software. Zoomed lesion
site three-dimensional diffusion tensor images were
represented using ParaView 4.1.0 software (Los Álamos
National Laboratory, New México, USA) (n = 6 per group,
10 sections per animal) as previously described [10].
Cell death evaluation
Cell death was analyzed in the infarct zone of at least 10
sections from each animal using TUNEL staining (TdTFragEL
DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit, Oncogene
Research Products, San Diego, CA). The number of
positive cells was counted in a minimum of 10 different

microscopical fields based on their nuclear morphology
and dark color using a 40× objective lens and image analysis
software (Image-Pro Plus 4.1, Media Cybernetics,
Rockville, MD, USA) (n = 6 per group, 10 sections per
animal).
Cell proliferation analysis
Cell proliferation was analyzed using Ki-67 staining
(1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) after 7 and 28
days, in 10 sections corresponding to the infarct area of
each animal, selected as previously described [18, 19].
The number of positive cells was counted in a minimum
of 10 different random microscopic fields using a 40×
objective lens and Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (n = 6
per group, 10 sections per animal).
The differentiation of the proliferating cells was analyzed
using co-staining with Ki-67 and NeuN (1:100,
Millipore), Olig-2 (1:400, Millipore) and glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP; 1:400, Chemicon) followed by goat
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:750, Invitrogen).
Images were acquired as a confocal maximum projection
using a Leica TCS-SPE confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) and the number of
double-positive cells was counted in a minimum of 10
different microscopic fields using a 40× objective lens
and Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software.
Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western
blot analyses
Frozen sections were stained using the CryoMyelin Kit
(Hitobiotech, Wilmington, USA), which allows sensitive
localization and visualization of myelin fibers. The mean
intensity of myelin staining in the region of interest
(ROI) was quantified using a Nikon Eclipse-Ti inverted
microscope and NIS-elements software. The lesion area
was studied in detail using immunofluorescence and
Western blot analyses. The white matter-associated antibodies
used were neurofilament (NF; 1:100, Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark), neurite outgrowth inhibitor (NogoA; 1:100,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), myelin basic protein (MBP;
1:100, Abcam) and oligodendrocyte (Olig-2; 1:500,
Millipore) followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:750, Invitrogen). For
Western blot analysis, the units were normalized based on
Β-actine (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich). To quantify the expression
of white matter-associated markers, the mean fluorescence
intensity was evaluated in a minimum of 10
different microscopic fields using a 40× objective lens.
The experiments, images and quantification of the
samples were performed on the same day using the
same microscope configurations, by blinded observers,
to eliminate bias due to background normalization
(four animals, four sections per animal).
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). Data were compared using the Kruskal-
Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney test. Values
of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The
analysis was performed using statistical SPSS 16 and
GraphPad software (GraphPad Software Inc, CA, USA).
Results
ADMSC characterization, migration and implantation in
the injured brain area
ADMSC showed typical fibroblast-like cell morphology
and their phenotype was CD90+/CD29+/CD45–/CD11b–
(Fig. 1a).
DiI and CD90 co-labeled cells were not observed in
the control group. Migration and implantation in the
brain were not observed on immunofluorescence images
of the injured brain area after intravenous administration
of DiI and CD90 co-labeled cells. However, DiI and
CD90 co-labeled cells were observed in peripheral organs
such as the liver, lung and spleen (Fig. 1b).
Effect of ADMSC treatment on functional recovery
To assess the potential of ADMSC administration to improve
functional recovery after subcortical stroke, motor
function was assessed before surgery and after 1, 3, 7, 14
and 28 days using the walking beam, rotarod and Roger’s
test. There were significant differences in motor deficit
scores between the treatment and control group; the
walking beam test performance was significantly better
in the treatment group than in the control group after 3
days (p <0.01),14days( p <0.05)and28days( p <0.05).
The Rotarod test was significantly better in the ADMSC
treatment group than in the control group after 1 day
(p < 0.01) and 28 days (p < 0.05). The Rogers’ functional
scale score was significantly better in the treatment
group than in the control group after 7 and 28
days (both p < 0.05) (Fig. 2).
Effect of ADMSC treatment on lesion size and tract
connectivity
MRI analysis showed no significant difference in infarct
size between the treatment and control groups after 1
and 7 days. However, the infarct size was significantly
smaller in the treatment group than in the control
group after 28 days (0.12 ± 0.01 vs. 0.6 ± 0.26, p <0.05)
(Fig. 3).
Myelin was stained using the CryoMyelin Kit to identify
the area of white matter injury in the subcortical infarct.
The mean intensity of staining in the ROI was
evaluated in the treatment and control groups, with
white indicating absence of myelin and black indicating
the presence of myelinated axons. There was higher intensity
(indicating absence of myelin) in the control

group (210.23 ± 14.30 mean intensity) than in the treatment
group (155.71 mean intensity ± 21.23) (Fig. 3).
DTI tractography data showed similar results in axial
diffusivity (120.35 ± 12.45 µm2/s and 126.78 ± 18.34;
p > 0.05) in both the control and treated groups, respectively
,at7days.However,comparedwiththecontrol
rats, 28 days after treatment the ADMSC-treated
rats showed significantly improved axial diffusivity
(127.98 ± 9.21 and 162.99 ± 13.65 µm2/s, respectively;
p < 0.05) compared to controls. These results suggest
that there was a significant improvement in white matter
thickness (width, breadth, depth) and restoration of tract
connectivity in the ADMSC-treated animals compared
with controls at 28 days.

Effect of acute ADMSC treatment on cell death and brain
cell proliferation
Cell death was analyzed on frozen sections by TUNEL
staining after 7 and 28 days. After 7 days, no significant
differences were found in TUNEL-positive cells in both
the control group (718.5 ± 146.3 cells) and the treatment
group (460.33 ± 120.5 cells). After 28 days, there were
significantly fewer TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic
area in the treatment group than in the control group
(24.5 ± 1.73 vs. 56.0 ± 3.46 cells, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4a).
Quantitative analysis of proliferative cells was performed
using Ki-67 labeling after 7 and 28 days. After 7
days, there were no significant differences in proliferative
cells in both the treatment group (83.5 ± 34.65 cells)
and the control group (19.5 ± 7.78 cells) (Fig. 4b). After
28 days, the number of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly
higher in the treatment group than in the control
group (13 ± 1.15 vs. 3 ± 1.15 cells, p < 0.05). The
proportions of proliferating cell types observed by costaining
with Ki-67 were not significantly different

3 % vs. 16 ± 5 %, Olig-2: 27 ± 3 % vs. 26 ± 4 %; GFAP,
33 ± 15 % vs. 27 ± 13 %) (Fig. 4c). However, although
there were no significant differences between the proportions
of the cell lines, higher levels of each cell type
were found in the ADMSC-treated group.
Effect of ADMSC treatment on white matter-associated
marker expression
After finding that ADMSC administration had a beneficial
effect on functional outcome, we investigated
whether the functional outcome was related to the levels
of white matter-associated markers. Western blot analysis
found that the level of NF (a marker of axonal
sprouting) was not significantly different between the
treatment and control groups after 7 days. However, the
NF level was significantly higher in the treatment group
than in the control group after 28 days (4.27 ± 1.26 vs.
1.00 ± 0.69 Arbitrary Units (AU), p < 0.001). The MBP
level was significantly higher in the treatment group
than in the control group after 7 days (1.09 ± 0.23 vs.
0.63 ± 0.18 AU, p < 0.05) and 28 days (0.80 ± 0.11 vs.

days, Ki-67 staining shows a significant increase in the number of proliferating cells in ADMSC-treated animals compared to the control group
(p < 0.05). c At 28 days after treatment, Ki-67 co-labeling with NeuN, GFAP, and Olig-2 showed different cell type proliferation including
oligodendrocytes. Data are shown as mean ± SEM; scale bars = 20 μm; n = 6 animals, 10 sections each per group. ADMSC adipose-derived

higher in the treatment group than in the control

Proteomics analysis of the ADMSC in vitro secretome
Proteomics analysis of the secretome of cell cultures
identified 2,416 proteins in the cell supernatants that are
implicated into different cell functions (Fig. 6a), such as
protein binding (carbohydrate binding, antigen binding,
ion binding, sulfur compound binding, and lipid binding),
metabolic processes, single and multicellular organism
processes, development, endodermal cell differentiation,
skin and cartilage morphogenesis, immune system processes
, cellular organization and biogenesis, response to
stimulus and biological adhesion processes . All functions
in detail are shown in Fig. 6c and d. Full proteomic data is
given in Additional file 1. Interestingly, some of these proteins
are also implicated in growth factor activity, such as
several trophic factors and receptors known to be also involved
in brain plasticity. Some of these trophic factors
are shown in Fig. 6b.
Discussion
The results of this study showed that ADMSC administration
plays a major role in improving the repair of
white matter fiber tracts in an experimental model of
subcortical stroke. We found that the treated group had
better functional recovery and smaller lesion size than
the control group. In addition, animals which received
ADMSC treatment showed significantly higher number
of proliferating cells (including oligodendrocyte progenitors
) and significantly less cell death at the lesion region
than animals in the control group. Analysis of fiber tract
integrity by tractography and CryoMyelin staining
showed that white tract thickness had been recovered in
the treatment group. The treated group with ADMSC
also had higher levels of white matter-associated
markers (NF, MBP and Olig-2) than the control group,
suggesting that ADMSC administration induced repair
of white matter fiber tracts.
Up to 25 % of ischemic strokes in humans are subcortical
or lacunar, which are confined to white matter regions
such as the striatum and internal capsule [1]. The
high frequency of damage to these areas in stroke patients
has motivated the search for useful experimental
animal models of subcortical stroke with white matter
affectation, as well as effective therapies to enhance the
mechanisms underlying repair of damaged white matter
(axon and myelin). In this regard, endothelin (one of the
most potent known vasoconstrictors) was considered the
best candidate to induce this injury with white matter
affectation [10, 20, 21].
ADMSC administration is considered an appropriate
therapeutic strategy because ADMSC enhance the natural
repair processes of the brain after injury. However, the
mechanisms underlying these repair processes are still unknown.
Our proteomics analysis identified thousands of
proteins, many of them not previously associated with
stem cell properties or stroke repair; for instance, we
identified a number of proteins such as hepatomaderived
growth factor, latent-transforming growth factor
beta, and connective tissue growth factor. Other proteins
previously implicated in stem cell therapy function
such as transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast
growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor or
brain-derived neurotrophic factor were also identified.
Moreover, gene onthology analysis identified a number
of protein functions not previously associated with stem
cell therapy function in stroke recovery. In this regard,
protein binding (carbohydrate binding, antigen binding,
ion binding, sulfur compound binding, lipid binding),
metabolic processes, single and multicelular organism
processes, development, endodermal cell differentiation,
skin and cartilage morphogenesis, immune system processes
, cellular organization and biogenesis, response to
stimulus and biological adhesion processes were highly
represented. Interestingly, growth factor activity was
not the main represented function in the cell secretome,
indicating that other functions are also relevant. Our
findings suggest that the release of the identified proteins
by the administered ADMSC could contribute to
improve functional recovery when allocated to peripheral
organs (spleen, lung and liver). However, futures
studies will be needed in order to understand the complex
molecular mechanisms involved in stem cell
therapy-mediated stroke recovery.
Various tests have been used to evaluate motor function
following brain injury. Previous studies by our
group have demonstrated improvement in the functional
outcome after ADMSC administration in another experimental
animal model of cerebral ischemia [9]. The
present study showed that functional recovery at 28 days
was significantly improved after ADMSC administration
than in the control group after subcortical ischemic
stroke.
In the present study, MRI studies showed a significantly
smaller infarct size in the treated group than in
the control group after 7 and 28 days. Our results are
consistent with previous studies that reported a reduction
in infarct size after ADMSC administration in another
animal model of cerebral ischemia [9]. This
reduction in infarct size could be related to the increased
tract thickness and axonal projections observed
by tractography and CryoMyelin staining. These results
agree with previously reported findings that neural progenitor
cell treatment in an animal model of cortical ischemia
results in white matter reorganization shown by
fiber tracking maps derived from DTI and by histological
staining [22].

On the other hand, we found that the density of
TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic area peaked after 7
days in both treated and control groups. However, the
treated group had less focal damage at 28 days, with significantly
lower numbers of TUNEL-positive cells than
in the control group. These results are consistent with
those of previously reported studies, which found that
ADMSC administration inhibited cell death in the infarct
area [5, 9].
The central nervous system continuously generates
new cells in several specific regions of the adult mammalian
brain, and this proliferation has been shown to
be enhanced by cell therapy. Ki-67 staining showed large
numbers of proliferative cells after 7 days in both the
treatment and control groups. In this regard, our results
are consistent with a previous study [23]. Furthermore,
there was greater cell proliferation after 28 days in the
treated group than in the control group. These results
provide clear evidence that ADMSC administration
induces significant cell proliferation at 28 days after
subcortical stroke. Furthermore, analysis of the proliferating
cell lines showed similar proportions of costaining
with Ki-67 and NeuN, Olig-2 and GFAP in the
treatment and control groups, indicating that almost
half of the proliferating cells in both groups were white
matter-associated cells (neurons and oligodendrocytes
). These findings indicate genesis of new astrocytes
and neurons as well as oligodendrocyte progenitors
and immature oligodendrocytes after cerebral ischemia.
Although the effects of ADMSC on neurogenesis, gliogenesis
, synaptogenesis and vasculogenesis after stroke have
already been described, the ability of ADMSC to promote
oligodendrogenesis after subcortical stroke is a
novel finding.
It is known that some brain repair mechanisms are
quickly activated after cortical ischemia [24], but there is
little information available regarding brain repair mechanisms
after subcortical white matter stroke. To increase
our understanding of these mechanisms, we investigated
the levels of white matter-associated markers (NF, MBP,
Olig-2 and NogoA) in both the treatment and control
groups. NF levels, a marker of axonal sprouting, were
not significantly different between the treated and control
groups after 7 days, suggesting that the extent of
white matter injury was similar in these groups during
the acute phase. However, NF levels were higher in the
group treated with ADMSC after 28 days, which could
be explained by enhancement of axonal sprouting after
ADMSC administration. In addition to axonal growth,
restoration of the myelin sheath is important for the
repair of white matter. Furthermore, Olig-2 levels were
significantly higher in the treated group than in the control
group after 28 days. These results support the concept
that ADMSC enhance oligodendrogenesis to
restore their loss due to ischemic injury. Our findings
are supported by those of a recent in vitro study, which
found that mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium
promoted oligodendroglial cell maturation [25]. In
addition to formation of mature oligodendrocytes, repair
of the myelin sheath by oligodendrocytes is essential
for achieving propagation of nerve impulses along
axons [26]. The present study analyzed the MBP level as
a marker of myelination. There were significantly higher
levels of MBP in the treatment group compared to the
control group after 7 and 28 days. These higher levels of
MBP and Olig-2 are consistent with the increased proliferation
observed for all phases of oligodendrocyte
progenitors. Our results suggest that ADMSC administration
increases oligodendrogenesis after white matter
stroke.
Finally, among the myelin-associated proteins, NogoA,
myelin-associated glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte
myelin-associated protein all share a single receptor
complex [27]. The present study did not find a difference
in the NogoA level between the treated and control
groups after 7 days. However, the NogoA level
tended to be lower in the treatment group than in the
control group after 28 days. These results may indicate
that ADMSC administration can enhance axonal
growth and plasticity by reducing the level of NogoA.
In addition to indicating axonal sprouting, these findings
are in accordance with the tractography and Cryo-
Myelin stain findings that suggest restoration of white
tract connectivity in the area of ischemia induced by
injection of ET-1.
Conclusions
The findings of this study support the concept that
ADMSC play an important role in enhancing some of
the major mechanisms of remyelination. ADMSC administration
resulted in a smaller lesion size and less cell
death, as well as increased cell proliferation including
oligodendrocyte progenitors, and higher levels of white
matter-associated markers (NF, MBP and Olig-2) and
restoration of white tract connectivity in the infarct area.
All these processes may help to explain the improvement
in functional outcome after ADMSC administration.
Therapies that enhance remyelination may help to prevent
the functional deficits resulting from those strokes
affecting the white matter.
