ABSTRACT
Purpose To assess hemodynamic differences between
aneurysms that occlude rapidly and those occluding in
delayed fashion after flow diversion in rabbits.
Methods Thirty-six elastase-induced aneurysms in
rabbits were treated with flow diverting devices.
Aneurysm occlusion was assessed angiographically
immediately before they were sacrificed at 1 (n=6), 2
(n=4), 4 (n=8) or 8 weeks (n=18) after treatment. The
aneurysms were classified into a fast occlusion group if
they were completely or near completely occluded at
4 weeks or earlier and a slow occlusion group if they
remained incompletely occluded at 8 weeks. The
immediate post-treatment flow conditions in aneurysms
of each group were quantified using subject-specific
computational fluid dynamics and statistically compared.
Results Nine aneurysms were classified into the fast
occlusion group and six into the slow occlusion group.
Aneurysms in the fast occlusion group were on average
significantly smaller (fast=0.9 cm, slow=1.393 cm,
p=0.024) and had smaller ostia (fast=0.144 cm2,
slow=0.365 cm2, p=0.015) than aneurysms in the slow
occlusion group. They also had a lower mean posttreatment
inflow rate (fast=0.047 mL/s, slow=0.155 mL/s,
p=0.0239), kinetic energy (fast=0.519 erg, slow=1.283
erg, p=0.0468), and velocity (fast=0.221 cm/s,
slow=0.506 cm/s, p=0.0582). However, the differences in
the latter two variables were only marginally significant.
Conclusions Hemodynamic conditions after flow
diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms in rabbits are
associated with the subsequent aneurysm occlusion time.
Specifically, smaller inflow rate, kinetic energy, and velocity
seem to promote faster occlusions, especially in smaller
and small-necked aneurysms. These results are consistent
with previous studies based on clinical series.
INTRODUCTION
Flow diversion is increasingly being used to treat
wide-necked intracranial aneurysms that are difficult
to treat with coils alone.1–3 However, flow
diversion does not immediately exclude the aneurysm
from the circulation. Therefore, until the
aneurysm thromboses and occludes, it remains
exposed to mechanical loads and biological processes
that could potentially cause its rupture.4
Presumably, reducing the time it takes to completely
occlude an aneurysm could prevent complications
such as delayed ruptures.4 5 Predicting or
controlling the occlusion time after flow diversion
is therefore important to improve the outcomes of
these procedures and avoid complications. The
purpose of this study was to assess the differences
in the hemodynamic environment generated immediately
after placement of flow diverting devices
between aneurysms that occluded quickly and those
that remained patent in a series of experimentally
created aneurysms in rabbits.
METHODS
Animal models
A total of 36 elastase-induced aneurysms were
created in New Zealand white rabbits following the
approach described by Altes et al.6 Four weeks
after their creation the aneurysms were imaged
with 3D rotational angiography (3DRA) and flow
velocities in the surrounding vessels were measured
with Doppler ultrasound. Subsequently, the aneurysms
were treated with a flow diverting device
(Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien). Two days
before embolization the animals were premedicated
with aspirin (10 mg/kg orally) and clopidogrel
(10 mg/kg orally). This medication regime was continued
for 1 month after embolization. Some of the
rabbits employed in this work were used as part of
other studies7 8 entirely unrelated to the current
study. This animal research was conducted with
appropriate institutional approvals.
Angiographic evaluation
The animals were sacrificed within 1 week (n=6),
at 2 weeks (n=4), at 4 weeks (n=8), and at 8 weeks
(n=18) after treatment. Immediately before they
were sacrificed, angiographic imaging including
3DRA was repeated and the degree of aneurysm
occlusion was categorized as: (1) complete occlusion
(no remnant); (2) near complete occlusion
(small remnant); or (3) incomplete occlusion (substantial filling of the aneurysm).
Hemodynamic modeling
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the
aneurysms were constructed using subject-specific
vascular geometries derived from the pretreatment
3DRA images and pulsatile flow conditions from
the Doppler ultrasound measurements.7 Models of
the implanted flow diverting devices were created
and virtually deployed into the vascular models.9
Vessel walls were assumed rigid, blood density was
set to ρ=1.0 g/cm3, and the Newtonian blood viscosity
to μ=0.04 Poise. The unsteady incompressible
Navier–Stokes equations were numerically
solved using finite elements and adaptive immersed
unstructured grids.10

Data analysis
Aneurysms were classified into two groups according to the end
time (time to sacrifice after treatment) and the degree of occlusion.
Group 1, the ‘fast occlusion’ group, included aneurysms
that were completely or near completely occluded within
1 week, at 2 weeks or at 4 weeks. Group 2, the ‘slow occlusion’
group, included aneurysms that were incompletely occluded at
8 weeks. In order to keep the fast and slow occlusion groups
well defined and with no overlap, subjects not within these two
groups were excluded from further analysis. The geometry and
post-treatment hemodynamics of each aneurysm were characterized
by computing a number of variables from the 3D CFD
models. All variables considered were averaged over the aneurysm
region and over the cardiac cycle. Exact definitions of the
variables can be found in previous reports.8 11 12 The geometric
and hemodynamic variables computed over the slow and fast
occlusion groups were then statistically compared using the nonparametric
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Differences were considered
significant if the p values were <0.05 (95% confidence). All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4 (Cary, North
Carolina, USA).
RESULTS
The end time, degree of occlusion, and corresponding occlusion
group of each aneurysm are presented in table 1. A total of six
aneurysms were classified into the slow occlusion group and
nine into the fast occlusion group. The mean and SD of geometric
and hemodynamic variables computed over these two
groups are shown in table 2 along with the corresponding
p values.
Ratios of mean geometric and hemodynamic variables of the
slow over the fast occlusion groups are graphically presented in
figure 1. Bars above 1 indicate that the mean value of the slow
occlusion group is larger than the mean value of the fast occlusion
group.
Aneurysms in the fast occlusion group had significantly lower
mean size (fast=0.900 cm, slow=1.393 cm, p=0.024), volume
(fast=0.205 cm3, slow=0.723 cm3, p=0.030), area (fast=0.982
cm2, slow=1.806 cm2, p=0.038), and neck area (fast=0.144
cm, slow=0.365 cm2, p=0.015) than aneurysms in the slow
occlusion group. They also had lower mean post-treatment
inflow rate (fast=0.047 mL/s, slow=0.155 mL/s, p=0.0239),
kinetic energy (fast=0.519 erg, slow=1.283 erg, p=0.0468),
and velocity (fast=0.221 cm/s, slow=0.506 cm/s, p=0.0582).
However, the differences of the latter two variables were only
marginally significant. The inflow concentration, shear rate, vorticity
, viscous dissipation, and wall shear stress (WSS) tended to
be larger in the slow occlusion group but there was no statistical
significance (p>0.05). The maximum and minimum WSS, oscillatory
shear index, area under low WSS, flow complexity
(CORELEN) and stability (PODENT), and mean aneurysm

transit time as well as the aspect ratio and aneurysm depth were
not statistically different between the two groups (p>0.05).
Flow visualizations of three example aneurysms are presented
in figure 2. From top to bottom, this figure shows isovelocity
(v=10 cm/s) before and after treatment and velocity streamlines
before and after treatment. The first aneurysm (left column) was
completely occluded before 1 week (fast occlusion), the second
aneurysm (center column) was completely occluded at 4 weeks
(fast occlusion), and the third aneurysm was incompletely
occluded at 8 weeks (slow occlusion). It can be seen that, immediately
after treatment, the inflow stream into aneurysms 1 and
2 is substantially reduced while in aneurysm 3 there is still a
notable inflow into the aneurysm. The flow pattern in aneurysm
1 changed significantly after treatment. In particular, the inflow
shifted to the proximal end of the neck and the intrasaccular
streamlines followed a simpler and smoother trajectory.
Aneurysm 2 follows the same general trend but with a slightly
larger flow activity within the aneurysm sac. The flow structure
in aneurysm 3 did not change markedly, although the blood
speed along the streamlines was reduced.
DISCUSSION
Currently there is no reliable technique to evaluate flow diversion
treatments of intracranial aneurysms and to predict their
long-term outcomes. Previous studies have focused on the identification of qualitative and/or quantitative characteristics that
could be used to prognosticate the outcomes of flow diversion
therapies.13–18 However, the effects of flow diverting devices
and the underlying mechanisms governing the thrombosis and
occlusion of cerebral aneurysms are still not well understood.
Our current study used rabbit models to demonstrate that the
flow conditions created immediately after placement of flow
diverting devices are quantitatively different between aneurysms
that subsequently occluded quickly and those that remained
patent for a longer period of time. In particular, the flow diverters
more efficiently blocked the inflow stream and the resulting
mean aneurysm velocity and flow activity were significantly
smaller in fast occluding aneurysms. In the present study, no balloons
were used to expand the devices and all devices were
reasonably well appositioned against the parent artery wall covering
the entire aneurysm orifice, except for two aneurysms of
the slow occlusion group. In these two cases, the proximal end
of the devices were not completely apposed to the wall which
allowed a thin flow stream to slide between the device and the
wall and to enter the aneurysm (see aneurysm 3 in figure 2).
Imperfect deployments can have a substantial impact on the
occlusion time and outcome of flow diverting procedures.
Our results are consistent with previous studies based on clinical
series.19 20This adds support to the validity of the rabbit aneurysm
models and also confirms the idea that post-treatment flow conditions
could potentially be used to assess the technical success of
flow diverting procedures and to predict the occlusion times and
long-term outcomes. In particular, our study indicates that the
mean aneurysm velocity, which can potentially be measured with
dynamic angiography,20 is a good predictor of occlusion time after
flow diversion treatment. However, in clinical situations there may
be other factors besides hemodynamics and morphology that could
affect the occlusion time after flow diversion, including response to
antiplatelet medication, comorbidities such as diabetes which are
known to alter the vascular response to implants, and habits such
as smoking which alter platelet function and tissue repair.
This study suffers from a number of limitations associated
with assumptions and approximations made in the CFD modeling
, such as rigid walls, Newtonian rheology, and idealized
inflow profiles, as well as limitations of the rabbit models, such
as flow reversal in the parent artery which does not occur in
human cerebral arteries, and limited serial imaging that prevents
visualization of the progression of aneurysmal occlusion.
Nevertheless, these models allowed us to quantitatively compare
the subject-specific hemodynamics between fast and slow aneurysm
occlusion groups, and to identify target flow characteristics
that could be used to accelerate the healing process after flow
diversion and ultimately improve outcomes. These findings need
to be further investigated and confirmed with larger series.
CONCLUSIONS
Hemodynamic conditions experimentally created immediately after
flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms in rabbits are
Figure 1 Ratio of average geometric (gray bars) and hemodynamic (black bars) variables of the slow over the fast occlusion groups. Bars above 1
indicate that the mean value of the slow occlusion group is larger than the mean value of the fast occlusion group. Statistically significant
differences between the two groups are marked with an asterisk. For definitions of abbreviations, see table 1.
