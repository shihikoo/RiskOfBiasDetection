Abstract
Background There is little information about clinical characteristics
, management, and outcome of patients with intracranial
aneurysms and internal carotid artery occlusion. We will
describe clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of
patients with coexistent internal carotid artery occlusion and
intracranial aneurysms.
Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 22
patients (eight males and 14 females) with coexistent internal
carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and intracranial aneurysms.
Results This series includes 14 females and eight males with a
mean age of 63 years (range, 49 to 80). These patients harbored
a total of 35 aneurysms, which were located on the same
side of the ICA occlusion in five cases, on the contralateral
side in 20 cases, while in ten cases the aneurysm had a midline
location (AcomA 9, Basilar tip 1). Treatment consisted of
surgery for eight aneurysms and endovascular embolization
for 13 aneurysms. No invasive treatment was recommended
for 14 aneurysms (eight patients with single aneurysm). No
permanent perioperative or periprocedural complications occurred
in the selected group of patients undergoing invasive
treatment. At a mean follow-up of 57months (range, 3–203),
no patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and three patients
had died of causes not related to the aneurysm.
Conclusion Surgical and endovascular treatment can be accomplished
safely in selected patients with coexistent ICA
occlusion and intracranial aneurysms. Conservative treatment
is a valid alternative, especially in elderly patients or in patients
with very small aneurysms, especially if not located
along the collateral pathway.

Introduction
With widespread utilization of noninvasive imaging techniques
, intracranial aneurysms are not infrequently diagnosed
in patients with coexistent internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion.
The occurrence of an aneurysm in a patient with associated
ICA occlusion is a challenging condition [5, 20]. The
aneurysm is often on the pathway providing collateral circulation
, and this may increase the risk of further growth and
rupture because of the increased hemodynamic stress [6, 8,
16, 17]. However, treatment of an intracranial aneurysm in a
patient with coexistent ICA occlusion may pose higher risks
related to the tenuous status of the collateral circulation and the
danger that minor compromise of flow can result in amplified
consequences [20]. Risks of treatment are also increased because
intracranial aneurysms associated with ICA occlusion are
often encountered in elderly individuals with significant
comorbidities and risk factors for atherosclerotic disease.
Scant literature is available on the diagnosis and management
of this condition, and most of the available information is based

on single case reports [2–7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20, 21] and on a
retrospective study [12].
In this study, we summarize our experience with the management
of 22 patients with intracranial aneurysms associated
with ICA occlusion.
Materials and methods
After institutional review board (IRB) approval, we crosssearched
an Institutional database of patients with cerebrovascular
diseases evaluated from 1994 through 2011, combining
the terms “intracranial aneurysms” and “carotid artery occlusion.” For the purpose of this study, we included all patients
with coexistent intracranial aneurysms and occlusion of either
the common carotid artery or the internal carotid artery.
Patients with Moya-moya disease were excluded from analysis.
Clinical and radiological information was retrospectively
reviewed. Information was abstracted regarding the patients’
demographics, risk factors (prior history of ischemic cerebrovascular
disease, smoking history, history of hypertension,
family history of intracranial aneurysms), aneurysm clinical
status (ruptured/unruptured), and symptoms/signs related to
the occlusion. Based on a combination of clinical information
and radiological features, we divided the etiopathogenesis of
the occlusion into atherosclerotic, dissection, iatrogenic, embolic
, or other. Based on the location of the aneurysm in
relation to the collateral pathways to the territory of the occluded
internal carotid artery/common carotid artery, aneurysms
were divided into those on the collateral pathway
(e.g., an anterior communicating artery aneurysm in a patient
with collateral flow through the contralateral anterior

circulation) and those not related (e.g., a middle cerebral artery
aneurysm in a patient with contralateral carotid occlusion).
Details about the recommended treatment (conservative, microsurgical
clipping or endovascular embolization) were collected.
Information about radiological and clinical followup
was obtained though review of medical record notes or
through direct phone contact with the patients or their
family members. In case of death during follow-up, the
cause of death was abstracted from the chart or from any
available medical record. Finally, clinical outcome was
assessed by attributing a modified Rankin Score [1, 13]
based on the information available. Attribution was done
by a study member (EC) who had not been involved with
patients’ treatment.
Results
Twenty-two patients (14 women and eight men) fulfilled the
search criteria. Their mean age was 63 years (range, 49 to 80).
In 16 patients, the ICA occlusion and the aneurysms were
present and diagnosed at the time of the first evaluation in our
institution (this includes Case 10, who presented with a ruptured
middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm with subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH) and intraparenchymal hematoma and
was found to have a coexistent, contralateral (to the ruptured
aneurysm) ICA occlusion). In six patients, the aneurysm and
the ICA occlusion were diagnosed at different times. In three
patients, the diagnosis of ICA occlusion preceded the diagnosis
of the aneurysm by a mean of 44 months, while in the
remaining three patients, the aneurysm was diagnosed first
and the occlusion developed during follow-up. Two patients
had had carotid sacrifice at other institutions for treatment of
complex paraclinoid aneurysms. These patients were evaluated
at our institution with a simultaneous ICA occlusion and
coexistent additional aneurysms. The most common presumed
etiopathogenesis for the ICA occlusion was atherosclerosis
(16 patients, mean age 67 years). In the remaining six
patients, causes for the ICA occlusion were therapeutic occlusion
to treat an ipsilateral (to the occlusion) ICA aneurysm
(two patients), to treat a carotid cavernous fistula (one patient),
to be due to a dissection (one patient), or unknown (two
patients). The mean age of patients with iatrogenic occlusions
and with occlusions due to dissection was 53 years. Fourteen
patients harbored a single aneurysm and multiple aneurysms
were present in eight patients for a total of 35 aneurysms. The
most common location of the aneurysms was the contralateral
(to the occlusion) ICA (17 aneurysms), followed by anterior
communicating artery (AcomA) (nine aneurysms), middle cerebral
artery (MCA) (four aneurysms) and other locations (five
aneurysms). Based upon a review of the available imaging
studies, aneurysms were felt to be located on a primary collateral
pathway in 29 cases, while in six aneurysms, it was felt that the
aneurysms were not along a collateral pathway. Treatment
consisted of endovascular embolization for 13 aneurysms
(Fig. 1), surgical treatment for eight aneurysms (Fig. 2), while
no invasive treatment was recommended for 14 aneurysms
(eight patients with single aneurysm). Complications of invasive
treatment included an asymptomatic periprocedural thrombus
formation during embolization of an anterior communicating
artery aneurysm. This resolved without clinical sequelae after
intra-arterial administration of Abciximab.
Fig.2 This 59-year-old female (Case 22) was found to have an incidental
intracranial vascular abnormality on a head computed tomography (CT)
done after sustaining a mild head injury. Catheter angiography showed a
pseudoaneurysm involving the cervical right ICA (a), a displastic aneurysm
of the paraclinoid right ICA (b, white arrow) and a small saccular
AComA aneurysm (b,black arrows) arising from a fusiform dilatation of
the AComA. The AComA supplies collateral flow to the left anterior
circulation, since the patient has also an asymptomatic left ICA occlusion
(not shown). Direct catheterization of the aneurysm was attempted, but
felt to be hazardous as it was difficult to achieve a stable microcatheter
position due to proximal tortuosity and the proximal location of the guide
catheter (given the patient displastic vessels and proximal cervical ICA
pseudoaneurysm, we did not want to advance the guide catheter more
distally than the very proximal ICA). The AComA aneurysm was successfully
clipped. Postoperative computed tomographic angiography
(CTA) 5 months after surgery confirms complete obliteration of the small
aneurysm and stable appearance of the fusiform AComA dilatation (c,
white arrow)

At a mean follow-up of 57months (range, 3–203 months),
18 patients were well (modified Rankin ≤ 2) and alive,
one patient had a modified Rankin Score of 3 because of
hemiparesis from SAH and right fronto-temporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage from a ruptured MCA aneurysm
(this patient, Case 10, had presented with SAH and intraparenchymal
hemorrhage from the MCA aneurysm and
coexistent contralateral ICA occlusion). Three patients had
died (cancer 1; ischemic stroke 1; complication after aortic
aneurysms treatment 1). The characteristics of the patients
considered in this report are summarized in Tables1,2and3.
Discussion
We report clinical characteristics and treatment outcome in 22
patients with ICA occlusion and associated intracranial aneurysms.
In our series, the most common etiopathogenesis for
the ICA occlusion was felt to be atherosclerosis, and this was
reflected by the older mean age and higher incidence of
atherosclerotic risk factors in this group of patients. There
are theoretical reasons to suggest that an intracranial aneurysm
located along the collateral pathway to the territory of the
occluded ICA is under higher hemodynamic stress because
of the increased flow. This, in turn, could predispose to aneurysm
growth and rupture [7, 9, 10, 16, 17]. The risk of
aneurysm formation, growth, and rupture may be increased
in the presence of a genetic predisposition to the formation of
intracranial aneurysms, such as in those patients who have
undergone iatrogenic carotid sacrifice to treat a contralateral
paraclinoid ICA aneurysm [14, 19].
Most of the literature on coexistent ICA occlusion and
intracranial aneurysms is based on the prospective risk of
aneurysm formation, growth, and rupture in those patients
treated with hunterian ligation of the ICA for paraclinoid
aneurysms. De novo aneurysm formation along the collateral
pathways has been noted after unilateral carotid ligation, with
incidence ranging from 0.7 to 4 % [2, 6]. These aneurysms
more commonly involve the AcomA and the posterior communicating
artery (i.e., those vascular territories more directly
involved in the collateral (to the ICA occlusion) pathways.
There is little, if any, information on the presentation and
management of aneurysms associated with ICA occlusion,
aside from some case reports.
The management of an intracranial aneurysm in a patient
with coexistent ICA occlusion is challenging. The natural
history of aneurysms on a collateral pathway is unknown. In
theory, the increased hemodynamic stress along the collateral
pathway may increase the likelihood of aneurysm growth and
rupture. On the other hand, treatment of an aneurysm along
the collateral pathway to the occluded territory is not without
risks. The tenuous status of the intracranial circulation and its
reliance on the collateral pathway on which the aneurysm lays
may amplify the consequences of even short interruptions of
flow, such as during temporary clipping. Of course, treatment
recommendations must be individualized based on a variety of
considerations. Based on our observations, some generalization
can be made, which again will need to be tailored to the
individual patient (hence some apparent discrepancies in our
own material).Conservative management of the aneurysm is a
reasonable option for small aneurysms (especially those not
located along the collateral pathway, such as on the MCA) and
in elderly patients. In 14 aneurysms managed conservatively
(of which 12 were along the collateral pathway), no bleedings
were observed after a mean follow-up of 61months.
Invasive aneurysm treatment is indicated in young patients,
small aneurysms that have demonstrated interval growth during
follow-up, and in patients with larger aneurysms felt to
require treatment. The choice of the best treatment strategy in
such cases depends on multiple factors that include aneurysmrelated
and patient-related factors. Whenever possible, we
prefer endovascular embolization because of it is less invasive
and because it allows continuous angiographic monitoring of
the collateral circulation. Surgery is a valid option in patients
with unfavorable geometry for coiling, or in situations where
the catheterization is felt to be at higher risk because of
increased tortuosity (Case 22) or because of underlying vessel
pathology (Case 12 with carotid cavernous fistula). Our series
shows that, in selected patients, surgery can be done safely
and effectively, as no complications were encountered in the
seven patients with eight aneurysms who underwent surgical
clipping. When surgery is contemplated, special precautions
must be taken, since in patients with coexistent ICA occlusion,
the brain may be particularly sensitive to ischemia on the side
ipsilateral to the occlusion and any compromise (even temporary
) of the collateral circulation can have amplified consequences.
RFor these reasons, it is mandatory to avoid or
minimize brain retraction, and as much as possible, reduce
the need for and the time of temporary clipping, as well as
utilize proper anesthetic techniques and brain protection.

Conclusion
We describe a consecutive series of patients with coexistent
ICA occlusion and intracranial aneurysms. This situation
poses special challenges. Good results can be achieved with
a strategy that utilizes different therapeutic modalities, including
simple observation, in various combinations and based on
the individual characteristics of the specific case.
