Abstract Infective endocarditis represents a classical
contra-indication to thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke
due to a potential increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
However, some case reports have suggested safety and
potential efficacy of intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis
in stroke related to infective endocarditis. We
present a case of ischemic stroke related to infective endocarditis
who was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator within the first 3 h of symptoms onset and
subsequently developed symptomatic multifocal intracerebral
hemorrhages, and summarize currently available data
on this issue.

Introduction
Embolism represents the most frequent and severe complication
of infective endocarditis (IE) [1]. It occurs in
22–50 % of cases and may affect all arterial sites, including
the brain. The vast majority of cerebral embolic events
are located in the middle cerebral artery territory [2].
Thrombolytic therapy remains controversial in the
setting of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by IE. IE
represents a classical contra-indication to thrombolysis due
to the increased intracranial hemorrhagic risk. However,
some case reports have suggested safety and potential
efficacy of intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis
in AIS related to IE [3–6].
We present a case of AIS related to IE who was treated
with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the first
3 h of stroke onset and subsequently developed symptomatic
multifocal intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), and
summarize currently available data on this issue.
Case report
A 68-year-old man with a history of asthenia, weight loss
and poor appetite for 2 months, presented with right-sided
hemiparesis with facial droop and aphasia. On admission
at the stroke unit, National Institutes of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS) score was 12. He was afebrile and cardiac
examination did not reveal cardiac murmur. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm. Blood pressure was
152/83 mmHg. The patient was under clopidogrel (75 mg
daily) following right internal carotid artery endarterectomy
1 year ago. Urgent multimodal brain MRI (Siemens 1.5 T
scanner) showed a left superficial middle cerebral artery
(MCA) distribution ischemic lesion on diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) sequence (Fig. 1). Left M2 segment MCA
occlusion was observed on time-of-flight (TOF) angiographic
sequence. A large perfusion defect was noted on the
perfusion weighted-imaging (PWI) sequence within the left
superficial territory of the MCA while gradient echo (GE)
T2* sequences showed no brain microbleeds.
IV tPA (0.9 mg/kg over 1 h, 10 % as an initial bolus,
total dose 63 mg) was administered 135 min after stroke
onset. At day one, significant neurological deterioration
was observed: the patient was stuporous and NIHSS score
was 22. Control brain CT scan revealed multiple bilateral
lobar brain hemorrhages and limited left hemispheric

subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. 1 panels b, c). C-reactiveprotein
(CRP) was 76.5 mg/l. Blood cell count and plasmatic
procalcitonin levels were within normal ranges. IE
was suspected and transthoracic echocardiography performed
at day one showed two vegetations (7 9 4 mm for
the largest) on the mitral valve. Neck ultrasound was
normal. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with amoxicilline
(12 g daily) and gentamycin (3 mg/kg daily) was started at
day one. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus gallolyticus.
Control MRI (Philips 3 T scanner) with TOF angiographic
sequences performed at day one and conventional cerebral
angiography performed at day two showed two small left
distal mycotic fusiform aneurysms of the MCA (Fig. 1
panels d, e). Full recanalization of the left MCA was
observed. Conservative antibiotic therapy alone was decided
regarding management of mycotic aneurysms after
multidisciplinary evaluation (interventional neuroradiologist
, neurosurgeon, and neurologist). Abdominal CT
revealed a small splenic infarction. Coloscopy was normal.
At day thirty, blood cultures were sterile and blood CRP
level was normal but cardiac vegetations were still present
on control echocardiography. Seven months after stroke
onset, slight aphasia persisted. NIHSS score was 1 and
modified Rankin Scale score was 2. Follow-up brain MRI
showed ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral sequelae
without recent ischemic lesion on DWI sequence or recent
hemorrhagic lesion on GE T2* sequence. No cerebral
aneurysm was found on MR angiographic sequences.
Transthoracic echocardiography at 7 month showed no
persistent vegetation.
Discussion
Our case report illustrates the difficulty of clinical and MRI
diagnosis of IE-related cerebral infarction in the hyperacute
setting of thrombolysis decision. Our patient had no cardiac
murmur, no fever and no evidence of microbleeds, a
potential imaging clue in IE [7, 8], on MRI T2* sequences.
There was no hint for the diagnosis of IE-related AIS
before IV tPA was given. Our observation also confirms
that conventional cerebral angiography remains the ‘‘gold
standard’’ for diagnosis of intracranial mycotic aneurysms
(ICMAs) as ICMAs were missed by pre-treatment MRI
(performed on a 1.5 T MR scanner).
Thrombolysis for AIS related to IE remains controversial.
Some case series have reported good outcome following
IV or IA thrombolysis (Table 1). The rationale for

thrombolytic therapy in this setting is related to the
assumption that thrombolysis may lead to thrombus resolution
by its action on the fibrin present in the vegetation
itself or new fibrin that may develop after embolization in
the cerebral arteries. Histopathological examination shows
that vegetations are composed of micro-organisms,
inflammatory cells, platelets, and fibrin [9]. Interestingly,
full recanalization of M2 MCA occlusion was observed at
day one following IV tPA administration in our patient.
Our case report and other case series of limited sample
size show evidence of the potential risk of major intracerebral
hemorrhagic complications in IE-related AIS
treated with IV tPA (Table 1) [ 3–6, 10]. Different mechanisms
are involved in the physiopathology of ICH in
IE: septic arteritis with erosion of the wall during the acute
phase (uncontrolled infection), hemorrhagic transformation
of cerebral infarction or rupture of an ICMA [1, 11, 12]. In
our patient, we speculate that ICH was related to septic
arteritis and potentiated by IV tPA administration. The
safety and potential efficacy of IV thrombolysis and IA
recanalization approach in IE-related AIS remain unproven.
Further research is needed to better elucidate the best
urgent therapeutic management in this setting. The currently
limited available data suggest that IV tPA is not
recommended when IE is suspected as the cause of AIS.

Ethical standard This study has been approved by the appropriate

Helsinki.
