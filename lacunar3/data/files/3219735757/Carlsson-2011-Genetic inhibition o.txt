Objective: Perinatal brain injury is a major cause of neurodevelopmental handicaps. Multiple pathways of oxidant
stress, inflammation, and excitotoxicity lead to cell damage and death, including caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Caspase-2 (Casp2; Nedd-2, Ich-1) is a developmentally regulated initiator caspase, which poorly cleaves other
caspases but can initiate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. We have investigated if Casp2 could
mediate perinatal ischemic brain damage.
Methods: Casp2 expression in human neonatal brains and developmental patterns in rats and mice were evaluated.
Casp2-deficient (Casp2/), wild-type (WT), and heterozygous (Casp2þ/) newborn C57BL/6 mice were subjected to
hypoxia-ischemia (unilateral carotid occlusion þ exposure to 10% oxygen for 50 minutes) or intracerebral injection of
the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor agonist ibotenate. In addition, Casp2 specific siRNAs were preinjected
into the brain of WT newborn mice 24 hours before ibotenate treatment. Brain tissues were examined by
immunohistochemical staining (cresyl violet, MAP2, NF68, Casp2, Casp3) and Western blotting. Lesion volumes and
injury in the cortical plates and white matter were quantified together with activated Casp3.
Results: Casp2 is highly expressed in the neonatal brain. Casp2-deficient mice subjected to hypoxia-ischemia at
postnatal day 9 present significantly lower cerebral infarction, reduced white matter injury, and reduced Casp3
activation in the thalamus and hippocampus. Both Casp2/ mice and siRNA-administered WT mice conferred
reduction of gray and white matter injury after excitotoxic insult at postnatal day 5. Casp3 activation was also found
reduced in Casp2-deficient mice subjected to excitotoxicity.
Interpretation: These data suggest for the first time a role of Casp2 in neonatal brain damage.

Injury in the developing brain is a worldwide health
concern. Perinatal damage can lead to life-long disability
including cerebral palsy, cognitive deficits/mental
retardation, and epilepsy.1,2 Brain injury results from a
number of disparate insults, but ischemia is an important
cause of potentially preventable handicaps in term and
preterm infants. Recent clinical trials show that therapeutic
intervention by brain cooling beginning up to 6 hours after
perinatal asphyxia reduces cerebral injury and improves
outcomes in term infants.3 Although these studies provide
proof of concept that in this context cell death is both
delayed and preventable, the protection is limited, and
there is still no treatment available for perinatal stroke or
brain injury occurring in preterm infants.4

stress, and inflammation, that accelerate cell death through
either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the region of
the brain affected and the severity of the insult.5,6 Accumulating
data suggest that apoptotic mechanisms play a
more prominent role in the evolution of ischemic brain
injury in neonatal rodents and humans than in adult brain
ischemia,7 and that apoptosis involves the mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor,8,9
which activate caspase-dependent and independent execution
pathways, respectively.7
Caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that have
strict specificity for an aspartic residue and mediate apoptosis
of mammalian cells.10 Caspase-2 (Casp2; Nedd-2,
Ich-1) is a highly conserved and developmentally regulated11 initiator caspase that poorly cleaves other caspases
but can initiate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
, and that regulates diverse stress-induced signaling
pathways including heat shock, DNA damage,
mitochondria oxidative stress,12,13 and cytoskeletal
disruption.14–16 Although exact mechanisms are still
debated, Casp2 can be activated by dimerization upon its
recruitment to RAIDD/p53-induced protein with death
domain (PIDD)-dependent activation platforms.17,18 In
neurons, where Casp2 is mainly cytosolic, cell death
induced by trophic factor(s) withdrawal was found to be
Casp2-dependent in wild-type (WT) contexts,19 but dispensable
in Casp2 null sympathetic neurons.20 Casp2-
deficient mice have mild phenotype, and adult animals
are equally sensitive to middle cerebral artery occlusion
as WT controls.21 However, in rats subjected to transient
global cerebral ischemia, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons death was reduced by inactivation of PIDD,22
although there was no direct evidence for or against a
direct Casp2 requirement.
To evaluate the hypothesis that Casp2 may be an
operative target during perinatal brain injury, we have
used Casp2-deficient mice and in vivo administered
Casp2-specific siRNAs. Here we present original data supporting
a role of Casp2 in perinatal brain damage in hypoxia-ischemia
(HI) and excitotoxic experimental settings.
Materials and Methods
Study Cohort
Human neonatal brain tissue samples were obtained from the
Wigglesworth Perinatal Pathology autopsy services at Hammersmith
Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Parental consent
was acquired according to guidelines of the National Health
Service (NHS), United Kingdom. Study ethics was obtained
from the Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte’s & Chelsea
Research Ethics Committee, NHS Research Ethics Services,
United Kingdom (ethics number, 07/H0707/139; postmortem
magnetic resonance imaging study on developing brain).
Animals
Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) and gave birth in the animal
facility (Experimental Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg).
Mice were housed with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Free access
to a standard laboratory chow diet (B&K, Solna, Sweden) and
drinking water was provided. All mouse experimentation was
approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of Gothenburg
(ethics number, 62-2008), with the exception of excitotoxicity
mouse experimentation that was done at INSERM U676
(approved by the Animal Ethical Institutional Review Committee
and performed according to the INSERM guidelines), and
was carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the
US National Institutes of Health. Seven-day-old Wistar rats
were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest-St-Isle, France).
Genetically Modified Animals
WT (C57BL/6) and Casp2 knockout (KO; C2/) mice were
provided by Dr C. Troy, Columbia University.21 Littermate animals
with mixed genotypes, including Casp2 homozygous, heterozygous
mutant, and WT mice, were used for experiments,
under approval by the ethical committee of Gothenburg University
(ethics number, 62-2008). The genotype of WT
(C57BL/6) and Casp2 KO (C2/) mice was determined by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA obtained
from mouse tails. Primers were ordered from Eurofins MWG
GmbH (Ebersberg, Germany). The WT allele was detected
using the primer Nedd B: CTC ACT GGC TAC CTA ACT
TCC and Nedd A: CCA TGC ATT GGG AGA CAC TTA C.
The mutant allele was detected using the primer Nedd C:
GCT ACC GGT GGA TGT GGA ATG TG and Nedd A:
CCA TGC ATT GGG AGA CAC TTA C. WT mice were
identified by a single 300bp band, C2/ mice by the presence
of a single 280bp DNA band, and HET mice were identified
by the presence of both bands. The PCR products were separated
on a 1.5% agarose/0.5  Tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid gel containing ethidium bromide. A 50bp ladder was
used to verify the size of the PCR products. The gels were visualized
using a LAS 1000 cooled charge-coupled device camera
(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Each PCR reaction (25ll) contained
1ll of genomic DNA and 12.5ll 2  QuantiFast SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Qiagen GmbH, Germany), and all 3 primers
were used at a concentration of 100lM. The PCR cycles were
94C for 3 minutes, 94 C for 1 minute, 60 C for 1 minute, 
72C for 1 minute throughout 30 cycles and then 72C for 10 
minutes and finally 4C until removed from the machine.
Unilateral Hypoxia-Ischemia in Newborn Mice
Nine-day-old mice were exposed to HI. HI was induced by
unilateral ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia
(10% O
2
, 36 C) for 50 minutes.8,23 Seven days after HI, the
pups were killed and perfused. The brains were carefully
removed, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 9lm-thick sections
on a microtome. Infarction volume and tissue loss percentage
were measured after MAP2 staining at each anatomical level.

Infarction was measured as the MAP2-negative staining area in
the ipsilateral hemisphere, and the tissue loss was measured by
subtracting the area of MAP2-positive staining in the ipsilateral
hemisphere from the area of the contralateral hemisphere. The
Cavalieri principle, where V ¼ RAPt, was used to calculate the
infarction volume and tissue loss (V as the total volume, RA as
the sum of the areas measured, P as the inverse of the section
sampling fraction, and t as the section thickness). No Casp2-
related sex effects were found in the HI experiments. Subcortical
white matter injury was analyzed by quantitative measurements
of immunohistochemical positive staining for neurofilaments
(NF) using Micro Image, version 4.0 (Micro-Macro AB,
Gothenburg, Sweden). The proportion of immunoreactivity in
the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated as percentage of the
staining in the contralateral hemisphere; therefore, the results
were expressed as the percentage loss of NF for the ipsilateral
hemisphere in relation to the contralateral hemisphere. Counting
was performed by a blinded examiner unaware of the experimental
groups.
N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor-Induced
Excitotoxicity in Newborn Mice
All ibotenate injections were administered on the fifth postnatal
day (P5), as described previously.24 The pups were sacrificed at
different times after intracerebral ibotenate injection, and the
brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde. After embedding in paraffin
, 15lm sections were cut on the coronal plane, from the
frontal to the occipital pole. Every third section was stained
with cresyl violet, and the total volume of the lesion was measured
using the Neurolucida software-controlled computer system
(MicroBrightField Europe, Magdeburg, Germany). No
Casp2-related gender effects were found in those experiments.
Sections adjacent to those used for cresyl violet staining were
used for immunohistochemistry. Sections containing excitotoxic
lesions were reacted with anti-GFAP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
or biotinylated Griffonea simplicifolia I isolectin (Vector Laboratories
, Burlingame, CA). Labeled antigens were detected using avidin-biotin
horseradish peroxidase kits (Vector Laboratories).
siRNA-Based Experiments
siRNAs were prepared as a solution in Jetsi according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (PolyPlus, Berkeley, CA).
Final solution contained RNAse free water, 0.08 mM dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
(DOPE), 0.24% chloroform/7%
EtOH, glucose 12.5%, 0.04 mM Jet Si. For intracerebral
siRNA injections, 0.4lg siRNA/mouse was administered (volume
of injection, 2ll) 24 hours before ibotenate. Double
stranded siRNA si2-a corresponded to the sequence of
the mouse Casp2/Nedd-2 gene (AACACCTCCTAGAGA
AGGACA; nucleotides 185–203). Control siRNAs si2Co contained
4 mutations in the same Casp2 sequence (AACATCT
ACTCGAGACGGACA). Annealed siRNA duplexes (reversed
phase high-performance liquid chromatography purified) were
purchased from Sigma-Proligo (Paris, France). Additional predesigned Casp2-related siRNA si2-b (ON-TARGETplus
J-044184-05, ACGGAACACUCCUUAGAUA) and si2-c
(ON-TARGETplus J-044184-06, GCACGUACUCCCACCG
UUG) were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific
, Waltham, MA). siRNA si2b and si2c contain chemical
modifications (20-O-methyl ribose) to reduce seed-related off-targeting.25 Primers were mGAPDH, forward GGCCTTCCGT

mCasp2, forward GAG CAA TGT GCA CTT CAC TGG; and
mCasp2, reverse CCA CAC CAT GTG AGA GGA GTG.
Immunohistochemistry
Whole postmortem neonatal brains were fixed in 4% formalin
for 7 weeks, then different anatomical positions from the frontal
, occipital, and parietal lobes were selected and processed
using a Leica (Bannockburn, IL) Tissue Processor. The blocks
were sectioned on a Leica Microtome at 6lm and mounted on
‘‘plus’’ slides and allowed to dry for 4 days. After routine deparaffinization
and rehydration, endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched by placing the slides into 3% hydrogen peroxide.
The slides were immersed in preheated antigen retrieval pH 6.0
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 minutes and cooled using cold
running water. Sections were blocked in 10% goat serum (Vector
Laboratories) for 20 minutes and incubated overnight at
4C with 1 of the polyclonal Casp2 primary antibodies (for rat
and human sections: H-19, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA; or for mice sections: C19, 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Control sections were run without the primary
antibody to assess the specificity of immunostaining. Sections
were exposed to the biotinylated goat–antirabbit secondary antibody
(1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour followed by avidin-biotin
complex (ABC; 1:200; Vector Laboratories) for 1
hour. The reactions were visualized with 3,30-diaminobenzidine
(DAB; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) for 10 minutes, and the
sections were immersed briefly in Mayer hematoxylin for counterstaining.
Finally, the sections were dehydrated, cleared in
xylene, and coverslipped. After HI, mice brain sections were
deparaffinized and boiled in citric acid buffer (0.01M, pH 6.0,
10 minutes). After washing, slides were incubated with 3%
H
2
O
2
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes. Nonspecific
binding was blocked for 60 minutes with 4% horse
serum in PBS. Primary antibodies (MAP-2, 1:2,000, Sigma;
NF Smi-312, 1:2,000, Sternberger Monoclonals, Lutherville,
MD) were incubated overnight at 4C, followed by the appropriate
, biotinylated secondary antibodies for 60 minutes at
room temperature. All secondary antibodies were from Vector
Laboratories. Visualization was performed using Vectastain
ABC Elite with 0.5mg/ml DAB enhanced with 15mg/ml ammonium
nickel sulfate, 2mg/ml b-D-glucose, 0.4mg/ml ammonium
chloride, and 0.01mg/ml b-glucose oxidase (all from
Sigma). In all cases, nonspecific labeling was investigated by
omitting the primary antibody.
Casp3 Immunohistochemistry
Ibotenate-injected mice were sacrificed at 24 hours or 5 days,

containing the largest lesion (defined as the largest surface of
combined cortical plate and white matter damage measured with
Image J) was used for anti-cleaved Casp3 labeling (1/500; Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Detection of labeled antigens
was performed with an avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase
kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Labeled cells were counted under the microscope
by an examiner unaware of the experimental groups. On each
section, a 0.25mm2 field from the most affected area was analyzed
in the neocortical layers at the level of ibotenate-induced
lesions. Five to 10 nonadjacent fields from 5 brains were
counted in each group. For HI mice, sections at the level of anterior
and posterior hippocampus (fixed at 24 hours after HI)
and anterior and posterior sections of thalamus (fixed at 7 days
after HI) were used for anti-cleaved Casp3 staining (1/100, BD
Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, cat # 559585; and 1/500; Cell Signaling
Technology). The rationale for selecting these brain
regions for quantification of cleaved Casp3 at the 2 time points
is that the maximum level of Casp3 activation occurs at 24
hours in hippocampus,26 whereas a more delayed apoptosisdominated
injury is reported for the thalamus.27,28 Detection
of labeled antigens was performed with an avidin-biotin horseradish
peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All immunopositive cells were
counted by an investigator unaware of groups. The total number
of labeled cells in anterior and posterior hippocampus was
counted for each animal, and the mean cell numbers in the
Casp2 KO (n ¼ 7) and WT (n ¼ 6) groups were compared.
Immunoblotting
Mice (n ¼ 3 per age) and rat (n ¼ 6 per age) brains were dissected
out and homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (15mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 320mM sucrose, 1mM dithiothreitol, 1mM
MgCl
2
, 3mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-K, and 0.5% protease
inhibitor mixture [P8340; Sigma]) as described.8,9 Samples
(50lg of protein) were subjected to Western blot analysis
with monoclonal anti-Casp2 antibodies (1:1,000, clone 11B4,
Alexis Biochemicals, Plymouth Meeting, PA; or Ab-1, Lab
Vision, Fremont, CA), or with antiactin (mice: 1/10,000,
Chemicon, Hants, UK; rats: 1:5,000, clone 1B4, Sigma) for
loading control, and revealed by an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled
, secondary antibody.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were conducted with Prism 4.0. Data are
presented as mean6 standard error of the mean and were first
analyzed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test. When the
data passed the normality test, the appropriate parametric test
has been applied (Student t test or analysis of variance
[ANOVA]) followed by the suitable post hoc test if necessary
(Bonferroni test). When the data did not pass the normality
test, the appropriate nonparametric test has been applied
(Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests) followed by the suitable
post hoc test if necessary (Dunn test).
Results
Western blot analyses of brain homogenates indicated
that Casp2 expression is high in the neonatal mouse and
rat brain, with progressive decrease from the second week
of life (Fig 1A, B). Further investigations by immunohistochemistry
showed rat, mouse, and human neonatal
Casp2 expression in cortical plate, hippocampus, and
white matter, with a predominantly cytosolic pattern of
expression (see Fig 1C–G).
Using the Vannucci HI model,8,23 a well-characterized
paradigm of perinatal brain damage involving unilateral
carotid ligation combined with exposure to 10%
oxygen for 50 minutes, whose neuropathological features
resemble asphyxia-related encephalopathy in human newborns
, we found, comparing infarction in the 3 genotypes
(Casp2þ/þ, Casp2þ/, and Casp2/), an overall
effect of genotype (§ in Fig 2A; p ¼ 0.05, Kruskal-
Wallis). Ad hoc post-test showed that Casp2-deficient
9-day-old mice presented significant reduction of infarct
volume when compared to WT animals (31.6%; p ¼
0.0253 Mann-Whitney; V ¼ 8.676 1.49mm3, n ¼ 24
vs control V ¼ 12.676 1.21mm3,n¼ 19) (see Fig 2A,
B). Casp2 null mice also presented reduced neurofilament
degradation in the subcortical white matter (NF68 loss:
39.17 6 4.36% in Casp2/, n ¼ 24; vs 50.66 6
2.97% in WT, n ¼ 19; p ¼ 0.0457, Student t test) (see
Fig 2C, D).
The developing brain is particularly sensitive to
excitotoxicity, a key component of the damaging response
that follows brain ischemia.29 In a well-established model
of perinatal brain damage, where the glutamatergic
agonist ibotenate (an excitotoxic alkaloid acting on
N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic receptors) induces
focal lesions in 5-day-old mice,30 we have studied the
impact of Casp2 gene deficiency in heterozygous
(Casp2þ/, n ¼ 14) versus homozygous (Casp2þ/þ, n ¼
10, and Casp2/,n¼ 6) mice and found overall significant
differences in the gray (p ¼ 0.0006, ANOVA) and
white (p ¼ 0.0001, ANOVA) matter (see Fig 2E).
Homozygous Casp2 gene deficiency conferred substantial
reduction of lesion volumes of cortical (40.8%; p <
0.001, Bonferroni) (V ¼ 0.29 6 0.01lm3, n ¼ 6) and
white matter (59.1% reduction; p < 0.001, Bonferroni)
(V ¼ 0.146 0.03lm3, n ¼ 6) regions, as compared to
WT animals (cortical plates: V ¼ 0.49 6 0.03lm3, n ¼
10; white matter: V ¼ 0.336 0.03lm3,n¼ 10) (see Fig
2E, F). Similar to Casp2/ but with a less marked effect,
Casp2þ/ neonates showed reduced lesion volumes of
cortical (23.2%; p < 0.05, Bonferroni) (V ¼ 0.37 6
0.02lm3, n ¼ 14) and white matter (28.75% reduction;
p ¼ 0.05, Bonferroni) (V ¼ 0.24 6 0.02lm3, n ¼ 14)
regions, as compared to WT animals (see Fig 2E).

In these experimental models, Casp3 activation
appeared to be, at least in part, Casp2-dependent. Indeed,
immunohistochemistry of Casp2/ versus WT mice in ad
hoc brains area showed a substantial decrease in the number
of cleaved Casp3-positive cells in Casp2/ mice; in
hippocampus 24 hours after HI (Casp2

In a complementary approach, siRNA targeting of
Casp2 was used to further evaluate the involvement of
Casp2 in perinatal brain damage. According to the rules
that have been established to recognize on-target effects
and mitigate off-target effects of siRNA,31,32 we used low
quantities of 3 different siRNAs (si2a, si2b, si2c) targeting
the same gene (mouse Casp2). As each siRNA has a
unique off-target spectrum, but the same intended target,
observing the same phenotype (neuroprotection) with
multiple individual siRNAs that contain distinct seed

sequences increases confidence that the phenotype results
from silencing of the intended target. In WT mice, intraparenchymal
administration of any of these 3 Casp2-
specific siRNAs conferred strong protection of the neonatal
brain against excitotoxic insult (eg, siC2-a, cortical
plate: 50.77% reduction; white matter: 50.65% reduction
, whereas no significant differences were observed
between nontreated animals and nontargeting controls
(Fig 3). Reverse transcriptase PCR quantitative analysis of
endogenous Casp2 and Casp3 gene expression after intraparenchymal
administration of Si2-a showed selective
Casp2 mRNA silencing (n ¼ 77; p ¼ 0.0290) and the absence
of cross-silencing on Casp3 mRNA (n ¼ 35; p ¼
0.1746). A similar Casp2 dependency was found in primary
embryonic cortical neurons subjected to serumdeprivation
, because siRNA-mediated silencing of Casp2
prevented apoptosis, neurite dismantling, and cell death.33
Discussion
Together, our results demonstrate for the first time that
genetic inhibition of Casp2 is neuroprotective in newborn
mice exposed to hypoxic-ischemic or excitotoxic
challenges. Both traditional KO and siRNA against

Casp2 reduced cortical and white matter damage in the
neonatal brain after excitotoxicity and hypoxic-ischemic
injury was attenuated in Casp2 gene deficient mice. This
suggests that Casp2-mediated cell death might contribute
to the pathophysiology of perinatal brain injury.
In WT animals, the brain expression of Casp2 is
high at birth and progressively decreases during postnatal
development. Our study shows that Casp2 null
newborn mice are (partially) protected against hypoxia-ischemia
and excitotoxicity, whereas once adult, those mice
are reportedly fully sensitive to focal cerebral ischemia.21
These divergent phenotypes could be explained by a developmental
control of cell death pathways in the
brain,8,26,34 and by genetic compensations (eg, Casp9
and DIABLO/Smac overexpression20) in traditional
Casp2 KO.
Detailed mechanisms by which Casp2 is activated
in the neonatal brain remain to be established. Because
genetic downregulation of PIDD was reported to reduce
hippocampal brain damage after transient global ischemia
,22 it is very plausible to speculate that stress conditions
that occur during perinatal ischemic brain injury
trigger either death receptors or PIDDosome activation
and consequently Casp2 activation, which in turn might

cleave the Bcl-2 homology 3-only protein Bid and trigger
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Both pan-caspase inhibition and Casp3 selective
inhibition have been reported to be neuroprotective in
various rodent models of neonatal brain injury,7,35–37
opening the possibility of pharmacological intervention.4
However, lack of protection with caspase inhibitors was
also reported,38–40 possibly reflecting differences between
experimental models or settings (eg, the age of animals40), specific in vivo properties of the used inhibitors
(eg, brain penetration41), and/or a shift to caspaseindependent
cell death pathways (eg, apoptosis-inducing
factor, autophagic death, necroptosis). Beside these mechanistic
and pharmacological considerations, there is a
potential safety issue regarding the clinical use of either
broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors or selective Casp3
inhibitors in the neonatal context. For instance, aggravation
of HI-induced lesions was reported in Casp3-
deficient mice,29 possibly reflecting the importance of
nonapoptotic functions of Casp3 in the (developing)
brain that include modulation of synaptic plasticity,
cleavage of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid receptor subunit GluR1, normal differentiation
and migration of neurons to the olfactory bulb, and
long-term potentiation.42–44 Null mutants of Casp3 and
Casp9 showed defects of programmed cell death in the
nervous system associated with severe brain malformations.43–46 In contrast, Casp2 null mice are essentially
developmentally normal.21 Hence, combined with our
finding that Casp2 mediates hypoxic-ischemic and excitotoxic
neonatal brain damage, one can suggest that
Casp2 might be a potential neonate-selective target for
future neuroprotective strategies.
