Abstract—Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) induce inflammatory
responses by activating their receptors, CysLT
1
R
and CysLT
2
R. We have reported that CysLT
2
R is involved
in neuronal injury, astrocytosis, and microgliosis, and that
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the selective
CysLT
2
R antagonist HAMI 3379 protects against acute brain
injury after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. In the present
study, we clarified features of the protective effect of
intraperitoneally-injected HAMI 3379 in rats. We found that
HAMI 3379 attenuated the acute brain injury 24 h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with effective doses
of 0.1–0.4 mg/kg and a therapeutic window of 1h.  It
attenuated the neurological deficits, and reduced infarct volume
, brain edema, and neuronal loss and degeneration 24
and 72 h after MCAO. RNA interference with i.c.v. injection
of CysLT
2
R short hairpin RNA (shRNA) attenuated the acute
injury as well. Also, HAMI 3379 inhibited release of the
cytokines IL-1b, interferon-c(IFN-c), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) into the serum and cerebrospinal fluid 24 h
after MCAO. Moreover, HAMI 3379 ameliorated the microglial
activation and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic
regions, but did not affect astrocyte proliferation 72 h after
MCAO. In comparison, the CysLT
1
R antagonist pranlukast
did not affect microglial activation and IFN-c release, but
inhibited astrocyte proliferation and reduced serum IL-4.
Thus, we conclude that HAMI 3379 has a protective effect
on acute and subacute ischemic brain injury, and attenuates
microglia-related inflammation. CysLT
2
R antagonist(s)
alone or in combination with CysLT
1
R antagonists may be
a novel class of therapeutic agents in the treatment of
ischemic stroke.  2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), namely leukotriene C
4
(LTC
4
), LTD
4
, and LTE
4
, are inflammatory mediators
derived from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic
acid metabolism (Singh et al., 2010; Back et al., 2011).
They are involved in many inflammatory diseases including
a variety of central nervous disorders, such as cerebral
ischemia (Fang et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2011a), intracerebral hemorrhage (Ji et al.,
2012), brain trauma (Zhang et al., 2004; Hu et al.,
2005), epilepsy (Takahashi et al., 2013), and brain
tumor (Nozaki et al., 2010). CysLTs act on at least two
G-protein-coupled receptors, CysLT
1
R and CysLT
2
R
(Singh et al., 2010; Back et al., 2011). Moreover, the
existence of additional CysLTR subtypes has been
reported, such as GPR17 that is activated by nucleotides
and CysLTs (Ciana et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2012) and
GPR99 that is preferentially activated by LTE
4
(Maekawa et al., 2008; Kanaoka et al., 2013).
The characteristics of CysLT
1
Rs have gradually been
elucidated by the application of ‘‘classical’’ antagonists
such as montelukast, pranlukast, and zafirlukast (Singh
et al., 2010; Back et al., 2011). In the central nervous system
, the CysLT
1
R is closely associated with ischemic
injury and post-ischemic repair. The CysLT
1
R antagonists
pranlukast and montelukast have neuroprotective effects
on focal cerebral ischemia in rats and mice (Yu et al.,
2005a,b; Chu et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2006; Zhao
et al., 2011b). However, the pathophysiological roles of
the CysLT
2
R are less known because of lack of selective
antagonists. CysLT
2
R knockout or transgenic strategies
in mice have demonstrated the involvement of this receptor
in inflammatory responses and pulmonary fibrosis
(Beller et al., 2004), vascular permeability (Hui et al.,
2004; Jiang et al., 2008; Moos et al., 2008; Ni et al.,

2014) and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (Jiang
et al., 2008). It has been reported that CysLT
2
R expression
is induced in brain trauma and tumors (Hu et al.,
2005), and it mediates ischemia-like injury in PC12 cells
(Sheng et al., 2006). In the brain of rats with focal cerebral
ischemia, CysLT
2
R expression is increased, and the
upregulated receptor is restricted to injured neurons in
the ischemic core in the acute phase (24 h); however,
in the late phase (14 days), it is mainly distributed in
hypertrophic microglia in the ischemic core and proliferated
astrocytes in the boundary zone (Fang et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2011a). The spatiotemporal profile of the
CysLT
2
R is similar to that of the CysLT
1
R after focal cerebral
ischemia (Fang et al., 2006). These findings indicate
that the CysLT
2
R is involved in ischemic brain injury.
Currently, selective CysLT
2
R antagonists (other than
the nonselective antagonist Bay U9773), Bay CysLT
2
and HAMI 3379, have been reported (Wunder et al.,
2010; Ni et al., 2011). Bay CysLT
2
protects mice from
myocardial infarction and inhibits LTD
4
-induced Evans
Blue leakage in mouse ear vasculature (Ni et al., 2011);
it also protects astrocytes from in vitro ischemic injury
(Huang et al., 2008). HAMI 3379, 3-({[(1S,3S)-3-carboxycyclohexyl
] amino} carbonyl)-4-(3-{4-[4-(cyclo-hexyloxy)
butoxy] phenyl} propoxy) benzoic acid, is devoid of CysLT
receptor agonism and shows 10,000-fold affinity for
CysLT
2
Rs versus CysLT
1
Rs (Wunder et al., 2010). It
effectively reverses the LTC
4
-induced perfusion pressure
increase and contractility decrease in isolated Langendorff-perfused
guinea-pig heart (Wunder et al., 2010).
We have shown that HAMI 3379 attenuates oxygen–
glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R)-induced ischemic
neuronal injuryin vitro, and that this is mediated by inhibiting
microglial activation, while the CysLT
1
R-selective
antagonist montelukast has a weak effect on OGD/R-
induced microglial activation, and attenuates ischemic
neuronal injury possibly via both receptor-independent
and -dependent mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2013).
Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of HAMI 3379
protects rats against acute brain injury after focal cerebral
ischemia (Shi et al., 2012). These findings suggest that
CysLT
2
R antagonists may be a new type of therapeutic
agent in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, but the
details of the effects of HAMI 3379 need further investigation
, especially the dose- and time-dependence as well as
the inhibitory effects on post-ischemic inflammation mediated
by microglial activation.
Inflammation is a key topic in current research on
ischemic stroke. Upregulation of cerebral inflammatory
cytokines, activation of local microglia, astrocytes and
systemic lymphocytes, and invasion of leukocytes into
the brain contribute substantially to the ischemic
damage (Lambertsen et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2012;
Turner et al., 2013). Whether HAMI 3379 inhibits inflammatory
responses such as the activation of microglia,
neutrophil infiltration of the brain and the generation of
inflammatory cytokines are still unknown.
In the present study, we determined the dose- and
time-dependent effect of HAMI 3379 administered by
intraperitoneal injection, and evaluated its effects on the
injury and inflammatory responses 24 and 72 h after
focal cerebral ischemia in rats. The CysLT
1
R antagonist
pranlukast was used as a positive control because its
neuroprotective effect on acute and late ischemic brain
injury has been demonstrated in previous studies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased
from the Experimental Animal Center, Zhejiang
Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou, China
[Certificate No. SCXK (Zhe) 2008-0033]. The animals
were allowed to adapt to the breeding-room under a
controlled temperature (20–24C) with a 12-h light/dark
cycle for 7 days before experiments. They were allowed
free access to water and food with the exception of
preoperative fasting. All experiments were carried out in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and
approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Zhejiang
University School of Medicine. We made every effort to
minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
Chemicals
HAMI 3379 was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor,
Michigan, USA), and pranlukast was a kind gift from Dr.
Masami Tsuboshima (Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd,
Osaka, Japan). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrzolium chloride (TTC),
cresyl violet, and chloral hydrate were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA); Fluoro-Jade B
was from Chemicon Co. (Temecula, CA, USA). All other
reagents used were of analytical grade and
commercially available.
HAMI 3379 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and pranlukast in ethanol. The solution was
freshly diluted with saline before use. To evaluate the
dose-dependent effects, diluted HAMI 3379 (0.025,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, the final percentages of
DMSO in diluted solutions = 0.0625%, 0.125%, 0.25%,
0.5% and 1%) as well as pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg, the final
ethanol = 0.25%) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min
before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and
brain injury was determined 24 h after reperfusion as in
our previous studies (Zhang and Wei, 2003; Fang et al.,
2006). To evaluate time-dependent effects, the rats were
given intraperitoneal injections of HAMI 3379 (0.1 mg/kg)
at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h after MCAO, and were sacrificed at 24 h
after MCAO. To evaluate the effects at 72 h after MCAO,
HAMI 3379 (0.1 mg/kg) and pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) were
injected intraperitoneally at 0 and 2 h after MCAO on
the first day, and then once daily until 72 h. In control rats,
the same volume of saline (0.2 ml per 100 g body weight)
was injected intraperitoneally at the same time points.
Intracerebroventricular injection of CysLT

The rat CysLT
2
R shRNA was specifically designed for the
silencing of rat CysLT
2
R (GenePharma Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai, China). The sense sequence was 50-GAT

C-30; the negative control (NC) shRNA sense sequence
was 50-GAT CCC CCC TTC TCC GAA CGT GTC ACG
TTT CAA GAG ATT CTC CGA ACG TGT CAC GTT
TTT TGG AAC-30. The cDNA of double-stranded
shRNA oligo was cloned into pFU-GW-RNAi-GFP
lentivirus vector (GenePharma) using the Hpa I and Xho
restriction enzymes.
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection was used for
CysLT
2
R shRNA administration. A stainless-steel
microinjector was stereotaxically implanted into the left
lateral ventricle at 0.6 mm posterior to bregma, 1.3 mm
lateral from midline and 5.0 mm vertically from the skull
surface (Pei et al., 2010). CysLT
2
R shRNA (2106 TU
in 4ll saline) or sterile saline (4ll) was injected over
10 min at 72 h and 48 h before MCAO or sham operation.
The microinjector was left in place for 10 min to minimize
back-flow, and then removed. Acute brain injury was
evaluated 24 h after MCAO.
To determine CysLT
2
R mRNA expression in the brain,
total RNA was isolated from the ipsilateral cortical tissue
at 24 h after MCAO using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacture’s
protocol. Reverse transcription was performed on 2lg
of RNA using a PrimeScriptRT reagent kit (Takara,
Otsu, Japan). Quantitative PCR was performed using
SYBR Premix Ex Taq(Takara) for CysLT
2
R mRNA
expression on LightCycler 480 System (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The primer sequences
were as follows: CysLT
2
R, forward 50-TGT CAC CAG
TGT CAG GAG TG-30 and reverse 50-ACT TTT GAG
GAC TCA GCT CCA A-30; b-actin, forward 50-GGC TGT
ATT CCC CTC CAT CG-30 and reverse 50-CCA GTT
GGT AAC AAT GCC ATG T-30. Results were
normalized to b-actin expression. The relative
quantification of the gene of interest was determined
using the comparative CT method (2-DDCt).
Transient focal cerebral ischemia
Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg). A polyethylene tube was
inserted into the right femoral artery to measure PaO
2
,
PaCO
2
, and arterial blood pH (Blood Gas Analyzer ABL
330, Leidu Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark), and a
computer-assisted system (PC-Lab, Kelong Inc.,
Nanjing, China) was used to continuously monitor blood
pressure. Blood glucose was monitored with a One-
Touch basic blood glucose monitoring system (Johnson,
New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5C with a warming platform
(Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT, USA) during surgery.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced
according to a previously-reported method (Longa et al.,
1989) with modifications. In brief, the left common carotid,
internal carotid and external carotid arteries were
exposed. A 4–0 monofilament nylon suture (Sunbio Biotech
Co. Beijing, China) with a round poly-L-lysine-coated
tip was inserted into the internal carotid through the external
carotid artery stump and gently advanced to occlude
the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 60 min of
MCA occlusion (MCAO), the suture was removed to
restore blood flow; reperfusion was confirmed by laser
Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Surbiton Surrey,
UK). Sham-operated rats underwent the same surgery
except for inserting the filament. Rats recovered from
anesthesia in a warmed box.
Determination of infarct volume
At 24 or 72 h after reperfusion, rats were decapitated
under chloral hydrate anesthesia. Approximately 5–
8.0 ml of cardiac blood was collected, and the serum
was isolated and stored at 80C until cytokine
measurement. The brain was quickly removed and cut
into six coronal slices of 2-mm thickness. The slices
were immediately placed in a 0.5% TTC solution at
37C for 20 min, and then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The stained slices were
photographed with a digital camera (FinePix S602
Zoom, Fuji, Japan), and the area of infarction was
determined using ImageJ software (NIH Image,
Version1.61, Bethesda, MD, USA). To minimize the
error caused by edema, the corrected infarct area was
calculated as previously described (Lin et al., 1993).
Infarct volume was calculated by summing the volumes
of the six sections.
Behavioral assessments
Behavioral assessments were carried out 24 and 72 h
after MCAO by an observer who was blinded to the
experimental groups. Neurological deficit scores were
evaluated as follows: no deficit = 0, failure to extend
right paw fully = 1, circling to the right = 2, falling to the
right = 3, no spontaneous walking and depressed level
of consciousness = 4. (Longa et al., 1989). An inclined
board test was used to assess balance and coordination
based on modification of a reported method (Yonemori
et al., 1998; Wei et al., 2003). Rats were placed on a
board (5030 cm), and once they were stable, the board
was inclined from horizontal to vertical. The angle at
which the animal fell from the board (holding angle) was
recorded. The test was repeated three times and the
average holding angle was calculated.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection from
anesthetized rats
CSF was collected using a described method (Nirogi
et al., 2009; Pegg et al., 2010) with modification. Briefly,
rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg), the neck was shaved, and the rat
was fixed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood
Dale, IL, USA). The position of the animal’s head was
maintained at a downward angle of45. The atlanto-occipital
membrane between the occipital protuberance and
the spine of the atlas was exposed. A needle connected
to a syringe was inserted horizontally and centrally into
the cisterna magna for CSF collection without making
an incision. The colorless CSF sample (80–120ll) was
slowly drawn into the syringe, and its color was closely
monitored to avoid any blood contamination.

Cytokine assay
Serum and CSF samples were collected 24 h after MCAO
and frozen at 80C until analysis. Interferon-c (IFN-c),
interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 in the serum and CSF were
measured using CBA Flex Set kits (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA). The minimum detection limits of these
kits are 6.8 pg/ml for IFN-c, 3.4 pg/ml for IL-4, and
19.4 pg/ml for IL-10. Data were analyzed by FCAP Array
Software (BD Biosciences). The cytokines IL-1b, IL-6,
and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were measured
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits
(Lianke Biologic Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Histopathology
In another series, rats were anesthetized 24 or 72 h after
MCAO and perfused transcardially with 4%
paraformaldehyde after a preflush with saline. The brain
was removed, quickly photographed with a digital
camera, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and
transferred to 30% sucrose for 5 days. Then a set of
serial coronal sections (10lm) at 2-mm intervals from
the frontal to the occipital poles were cut on a
cryomicrotome (CM1900, Leica, Wezlar, Germany).
The neuronal organization of the brain was assessed
by cresyl violet staining (Tureyen et al., 2004). Neurons
were immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody
against neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN, a specific marker
of neurons; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The sections
were incubated overnight at 4C with anti-NeuN
antibody (1:200), followed by Cy3-conjugated goat antimouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:200, Chemicon) for
2 h at room temperature. NC sections were treated identically
, except that the primary antibody was omitted. A
fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Tokyo, Japan)
was used for the observation of stained sections. The
neurons in five 200-lm2 squares in temporoparietal cortical
layers III and IV, both in the ischemic core and the
boundary zone, were counted using ImageJ software.
To detect degenerating neurons, the sections were
stained with Fluoro-Jade B as previously described
(Schmued and Hopkins, 2000). Sections were immersed
in 1% NaOH in 80% ethanol for 5 min, incubated in 70%
ethanol for 2 min, and washed with distilled water for
2 min. The sections were then incubated in 0.06% potassium
permanganate for 15 min on a rotating platform,
rinsed in distilled water for 2 min, and transferred to
0.004% Fluoro-Jade B staining solution in 0.1% acetic
acid (prepared 10 min before use) for 1 h. The stained
sections were examined under the fluorescence microscope
(Olympus BX51). Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons
were counted in temporoparietal cortical layers III and IV.
For immunohistochemical analysis, the sections were
blocked with 0.3% H
2
O
2
in methanol for 30 min, gradually
hydrated to distilled water, and incubated for 2 h with 5%
goat serum to block nonspecific immune reactions.
Sections were then incubated overnight at 4C with
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ionized calciumbinding
adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1, a marker of
microglia/macrophages, 1:1000; Wako, Osaka, Japan),
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker of
astrocytes, 1:600; Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA),
myeloperoxidase (MPO, a marker of neutrophilic
granulocytes, 1:800; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN),
and mouse anti-ED1 (a marker of phagocytic
microglia/macrophages, 1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). After washing, the sections were incubated with
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (1:200,
Vectorlab, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2 h, followed by
incubation with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:200,
Vectorlab) for 2 h. Finally, the sections were exposed for
0.5 min to 0.01% 3,30-diaminobenzidine. The stained
sections were examined under the microscope, and
Iba-1-, ED1-, GFAP-, and MPO-positive cells were
counted in the ischemic core, boundary zone, and at the
same locations in the contralateral uninjured cortex. No
positive staining was detected when normal goat serum
was used instead of the primary antibody.
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as mean ± S.E.M. Neurological deficit
scores were analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal–
Wallis test. Significance of differences was analyzed by
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by
Newman–Keuls post-hoc multiple comparison (Prism
4.02, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Physiological changes and survival after MCAO
There were no significant differences in mean arterial
blood pressure (MABP), PaO
2
, PaCO
2
, arterial blood
pH, and blood glucose between 30 min before and
30 min after MCAO. HAMI 3379 (0.4 mg/kg) and
pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) did not affect these physiological
variables (Table 1). Totally 4.52% (10/221) of the rats
were excluded due to no sufficient reduction in regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and no rat died during
surgery. A total of 13.51% (20/148) of the rats died of
ischemic injury within 24 h and 20.63% (13/63) within
72 h in the ischemic groups, but all the sham-operated
rats survived. No significant difference in the mortality
rates was found between the ischemic groups.
Dose-dependent effect of HAMI 3379 on acute brain
injury
We first determined the dose-dependent effect of HAMI
3379 on acute brain injury 24 h after MCAO. The
photographs of whole brains showed the change
(swelling) on the surface, and the coronal slices stained
with TTC showed infarcts in the ischemic hemispheres
(Fig. 1A). HAMI 3379 (0.1–0.4 mg/kg) significantly
reduced the infarct volume and percentage increase in
the ischemic/contralateral hemispheric ratio (an index of
brain edema, Fig. 1B, C). HAMI 3379 at 0.1–0.4 mg/kg
significantly reduced the neurological deficit score
(Fig. 1D) and increased the holding angle in the inclined
board test (Fig. 1E) at 24 h. Pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg)
showed similar protective effects.
56 Q. J. Shi et al./Neuroscience 291 (2015) 53–69
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
To determine whether the effects of HAMI 3379 are
CysLT
2
R-dependent, the CysLT
2
R shRNA was injected
intracerebroventricularly 72 and 48 h before MCAO to
inhibit CysLT
2
R expression. Real-time PCR results
showed that the shRNA decreased CysLT
2
R mRNA
expression in the brain by 71% (sham operation) and
25% (MCAO) 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 2A). The CysLT
2
R
shRNA significantly reduced ischemic infarction
(Fig. 2B, C) and edema (Fig. 2D) in the ischemic
hemisphere 24 h after MCAO. These results suggested
that the protective effects of HAMI 3379 might depend
on the blockade of CysLT
2
R in the brain.
Time-dependent effect of HAMI 3379 on acute and
subacute injury
Second, we determined the effect of post-ischemic HAMI
3379 treatment on acute and subacute brain injury. HAMI
3379 (0.1 mg/kg) administered at 0 and 1 h after
reperfusion reduced infarct volume (Fig. 3A-a),
attenuated brain edema (Fig. 3A-b), reduced
neurological score (Fig. 3A-c), and increased holding
angle (Fig. 3A-d). However, when given at 4 h after
reperfusion, HAMI 3379 did not have any significant
effect, and when given at 2 h, it only attenuated brain
edema (Fig. 3A-b). Thus, its therapeutic window is 1h.
In addition, post-ischemic treatment with HAMI 3379
(0.1 mg/kg, 0 h after reperfusion) showed a protective
effect on subacute brain injury at 72 h, similar to that of
pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) (Fig. 3B).
Effect of HAMI 3379 on cytokine release in the acute
phase
Third, we determined the effect of HAMI 3379 on cytokine
levels in serum and CSF in the acute phase. The serum
levels of the cytokines IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-c, and
TNF-a as well as the CSF levels of IL-1b, IFN-c, and
TNF-a significantly increased at 24 h. However, the
levels of IL-6 both in the serum and CSF as well as
CSF IL-4 and IL-10 did not change significantly. HAMI
3379 (0.1 mg/kg, 0 h after reperfusion) reduced the
increased levels of IL-1b, IFN-c, and TNF-a in both
serum and CSF, while pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) decreased
serum and CSF IL-1b and TNF-a as well as serum IL-4,
but did not affect the serum and CSF levels of IFN-c.
Neither agent affected the increased serum IL-10 levels
(Fig. 4).
Effect of HAMI 3379 on neuronal damage
Fourth, we examined ischemic neuronal injury and the
effect of HAMI 3379. The cresyl violet staining showed
evident neuronal damage in the temporoparietal cortex
of the ischemic hemisphere; the cell bodies shrank and
were deeply stained, and the Nissl bodies disappeared
(Fig. 5B). NeuN-positive neuron density was significantly
decreased at 24 and 72 h (Fig. 5C). HAMI 3379 and
pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg, 0 h after reperfusion) ameliorated
the neuronal loss both in the ischemic core and the
boundary zone 24 h (Fig. 5D) and 72 h after MCAO
(Fig. 5E).
The density of degenerating neurons stained with
Fluoro-Jade B was significantly increased in the
ischemic cortex 24 and 72 h after MCAO, and
degenerating neurons were few in the sham-operated
rats (Fig. 6A). HAMI 3379 and pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg,
0 h after reperfusion) decreased the number of
degenerating neurons in the ischemic core and
boundary zone at 24 h (Fig. 6B) and 72 h (Fig. 6C).

Effects of HAMI 3379 on glial cells and neutrophils
Finally, we determined the effects of HAMI 3379 on
inflammation-related glial cells and neutrophils. The
number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was not
significantly increased at 24 h compared with the
contralateral hemisphere; however, astrocytes became
hypertrophic and their number was increased in the
boundary zone 72 h after MCAO (Fig. 7A). However,
astrocytes in the ischemic core remarkably decreased at
24 h and disappeared at 72 h. Pranlukast inhibited the
increase in astrocyte number in the boundary zone at

72 h, but HAMI 3379 had no such effect (Fig. 7B, right).
Neither affected astrocyte number at 24 h (Fig. 7B, left).
The number of Iba-1-positive cells, including
ramified microglia and activated (ameboid/round)
microglia/macrophages, did not change significantly at
24 h (Fig. 8B), but increased at 72 h especially in the
ischemic core (Fig. 8A, C). HAMI 3379, but not
pranlukast, decreased the number of both ramified
microglia and activated microglia/macrophages at 72 h
(Fig. 8C). To label activated phagocytic microglia or
macrophages, an antibody against the lysosomal
phagocytic marker ED1 was applied. ED1-positive cells
were not detected in sham controls, but were found in
the ischemic core and the boundary zone at 24 h
(Fig. 9B) and further increased in the ischemic core at
72 h (Fig. 9A, C). HAMI 3379 and pranlukast had no
significant effect on the increased ED1-positive cells at
24 h (Fig. 9B); however, HAMI 3379, but not pranlukast,
reduced the increased ED1-positive cells at 72 h
(Fig. 9C). These results indicated that ED1-positive
activated microglia/macrophages were increased earlier
than Iba-1-positive cells, while HAMI 3379 did not affect
the changes at 24 h but reduced both cell types stained
by Iba-1 and ED1 at 72 h.
To evaluate the effect of HAMI 3379 on neutrophil
accumulation, we counted the number of MPO-positive
neutrophils in the ischemic brain. The numbers of MPO-
positive neutrophils significantly increased at 24 and
72 h in the boundary zone (Fig. 10A). HAMI 3379 and
pranlukast did not affect the increased neutrophil
number at 24 h (Fig. 10B, left), but they significantly
inhibited neutrophil accumulation at 72 h (Fig. 10B, right).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we administered HAMI 3379 to rats
by intraperitoneal injection, and determined its dose- and
time-dependent protective effects against ischemic brain
injury. These findings extended our previous report that
intracerebroventricular injection of HAMI 3379 has a
protective effect on acute brain injury after focal cerebral
ischemia in rats (Shi et al., 2012). Moreover, based on
the data at 24 h, we showed that the effective dose of
HAMI 3379 was 0.1–0.4 mg/kg, and the therapeutic window
was within 1 h after ischemia. Its effective dose is
similar to those of the CysLT
1
R antagonists pranlukast
(Zhang and Wei, 2003; Yu et al., 2005a; Fang et al.,
2006)) and montelukast (Yu et al., 2005b), while the
therapeutic window is longer than that of montelukast
(30 min) (Yu et al., 2005b). The therapeutic window of
HAMI 3379 (1 h) is tied to the time course of production
of the endogenous agonists CysLTs. Namely brain levels
of CysLTs reach the first peak at3 h, and the high level
lasts at least for 24 h after MCAO in rats (Zhou et al.,
2006). Moreover, the similar protection by RNA interference
with i.c.v. injection of CysLT
2
R shRNA suggested
that the effects of HAMI 3379 might be CysLT
2
R-
dependent.
The cellular responses to ischemia (other than
neuronal degeneration) exhibited a trend of gradual
aggravation, i.e. relatively mild at 24 h and more severe
at 72 h after MCAO. The number of astrocytes and
microglia/macrophages was not significantly increased,
while that of activated microglia/macrophages was
mildly increased at 24 h indicating a delayed response.
In the acute phase (24 h), HAMI 3379 and pranlukast
significantly attenuated the neuronal loss and
degeneration; however, they neither affected the
numbers of astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, nor

in the acute phase (24 h), but in proliferated astrocytes
and microglia/macrophages in the subacute/chronic

antagonists were ineffective on changes in activated

microglia/macrophages and only showed a tendency to
reduce infiltrated neutrophils 24 h after MCAO, they might
not act on the earlier stage of microglial activation or have
an effect too weak to show significant differences.
The most important and specific effect of HAMI 3379
was attenuation of microglia/macrophage-associated
post-ischemic inflammation in the subacute phase
(72 h). HAMI 3379 attenuated ischemic injury (infarct
volume, edema, behavioral dysfunction, neuronal
damage and neutrophil infiltration) as effectively as the
positive control pranlukast. However, the antiinflammatory
effect of HAMI 3379 differed from that of
pranlukast. HAMI 3379 inhibited the increase in numbers
of microglia and activated microglia/macrophages, but
pranlukast did not. Consistent with these results,
pranlukast did not inhibit the increase in microglial
number after focal cerebral ischemia in rat brain in a
previous study (Chu et al., 2006). Otherwise, HAMI 3379
did not affect the increase in astrocyte number at 72 h;
however, pranlukast did reduce this astrocyte response
at 72 h, which supports our previous findings (Yu et al.,
2005a; Fang et al., 2006). Thus, HAMI 3379 showed a distinct
effect on microgliosis rather than astrocytosis, which
is supported by evidence from anin vitrostudy. In primary

cultures of rat neurons, microglia and mixed cortical cells,
HAMI 3379 inhibits the microglial phagocytotic activity and
cytokine release induced by ischemia-like injury or the
agonists LTD
4
and NMLTC
4
, thereby indirectly attenuating
the neuronal injury mediated by the activated microglia
(Zhang et al., 2013). These in vitro findings indicate that
CysLT
2
Rs play a major role in microglial activation, supporting
the present result that HAMI 3379 inhibited microglia-mediated
post-ischemic inflammation in vivo.
On the other hand, the CysLT
1
R is partly involved in
ischemia-like and agonist-induced microglial activation,
only attenuating cytokine release but not phagocytosis
(Zhang et al., 2013). However, the CysLT
1
R is a major
regulator of post-ischemic astrocytosis and glial scar formation.
It mediates the astrocyte proliferation induced
by mild ischemia-like stimulation or lower concentrations
of LTD
4
(Huang et al., 2008), and astrocyte migration
induced by transformation growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1)
and LTD
4
(Huang et al., 2012). The CysLT
1
R antagonist
pranlukast inhibits these cellular responses and also
attenuates glial scar formation in the chronic phase of
focal cerebral ischemia in mice (Yu et al., 2005a) and rats
(Fang et al., 2006). In contrast, unlike pranlukast, HAMI
3379 did not have a significant effect on the increased
astrocyte density 72 h after MCAO in the boundary zone.
In astrocyte experiments, astrocyte proliferation is
induced by mild ischemic stimulation, which mimics the
changes in the boundary zone; this response is mediated
by activating CysLT
1
Rs, but not CysLT
2
Rs (Huang et al.,
2008). Therefore, pranlukast antagonizes the CysLT
1
R
responses to relatively mild ischemic injury in the boundary
zone, but HAMI 3379 did not show a remarkable effect
in the present study.
Both HAMI 3379 and pranlukast reduced the number
of infiltrated neutrophils, blood-derived inflammatory
cells, in the ischemic brain. This may be due to their
effects on increasing the permeability of the blood–brain
barrier (BBB). Pranlukast inhibits BBB disruption and
reduces neutrophil infiltration (Chu et al., 2006). Intracerebroventricular
injection of HAMI 3379 reduces endogenous
IgG exudation after focal cerebral ischemia in rats
(Shi et al., 2012), suggesting that it might attenuate
BBB disruption to inhibit neutrophil infiltration.
In regard to the inflammatory cytokines, we measured
IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-c, and TNF-a in the serum
and CSF 24 h after MCAO. Among these cytokines, the
levels of IL-6 in the serum and CSF as well as CSF IL-4
and IL-10 did not change significantly. HAMI 3379 and
pranlukast inhibited the increased levels of IL-1b and
TNF-a, typical pro-inflammatory cytokines (Clausen
et al., 2008; Watters and O’Connor, 2011; Lambertsen
et al., 2012; Galea and Brough, 2013), in the serum and
CSF, indicating that they exert general anti-inflammatory
effects. However, they had different effects on IFN-c
and IL-4 levels; HAMI 3379 reduced the IFN-clevels both
in the serum and CSF, while pranlukast reduced the

serum IL-4 level. IFN-c is derived from T-helper 1 (TH1)
cells, and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke;
whereas IL-4 is from T-helper 2 (TH2) cells, and may play
a protective role in ischemic stroke (Arumugam et al.,
2005; Lakhan et al., 2009; Brait et al., 2012). Consistent
with our results with pranlukast, human TH2 cells respond
to CysLTs by selectively expressing CysLT
1
Rs
(Parmentier et al., 2012); pranlukast specifically suppresses
TH2 cell-induced inflammation in a mouse model
of ovalbumin-induced skin allergy (Terui et al., 2001).
However, pranlukast neither affects IFN-c release in the
lung of asthmatic mice (Matsuse et al., 2006), nor the
TH1-type cytokine IL-2 from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells when stimulated by mite allergen (Tohda et al.,
1999). The modulation of IFN-c or other TH2-type cytokines
by CysLT
2
Rs and the effects of HAMI 3379 remain to
be clarified. Of course, IFN-c and IL-4 could be released
from other types of leukocytes, such as neutrophils

(Lambertsen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012) and macrophages
(Yamagami et al., 1999). How both antagonists
act on the cells and the temporal pattern of their effects
require further investigation. Our findings indicate that
pranlukast and HAMI 3379 have similar but distinct effects
on cytokine release after focal cerebral ischemia, and the
mechanisms require investigation.
Our findings in the present study further suggest the
therapeutic potential of both CysLTR antagonists as well
as their possible combination in the treatment of
ischemic stroke. Anti-inflammatory drugs represent a
therapeutic approach because post-ischemic
inflammation in the brain is a hallmark of stroke
pathology (Lakhan et al., 2009; Tuttolomondo et al.,
2009; Jin et al., 2013). CysLTs are potent inflammatory
mediators in ischemic stroke (Zhou et al., 2006; Back
et al., 2011), thus their antagonists may have neuroprotective
effects. We have reported regulatory roles of the
CysLT
1
R and CysLT
2
R in ischemic neuronal injury
(Fang et al., 2006; Sheng et al., 2006; Zhao et al.,
2011a; Zhang et al., 2013), astrocyte and microglial activation
(Huang et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012), and postischemic
inflammation (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2013) as well as the effects of their antagonists. Especially
, the CysLT
2
R mediates microglial activation and indirectly
induces ischemic neuronal injury in vitro (Zhang
et al., 2013). In the present study, we not only confirmed
the in vivo protective effect of HAMI 3379 previously
reported (Shi et al., 2012), but also defined the doseand
time-dependent features. Its effect on microglial activation
and IFN-c release is superior to the CysLT
1
R
antagonist pranlukast.

CONCLUSION
In summary, intraperitoneal injection of HAMI 3379
attenuates acute ischemic injury with an effective dose
range of 0.1–0.4 mg/kg and a therapeutic window of
1 h, and it also inhibits subacute inflammation,
especially microglia/macrophage responses, after focal
cerebral ischemia in rats. Its effects are generally similar
to the CysLT
1
R antagonist pranlukast, but it has a
distinct effect on the microglia/macrophage response
and IFN-c release. Thus, CysLT
2
R antagonists may be
a novel class of therapeutic agents, and their
combination with CysLT
1
R antagonist may be
synergistic in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
