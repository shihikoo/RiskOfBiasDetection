Erythropoietin (EPO) has protective effects on many neurological diseases, including cerebral ischemia.
Here, we aimed to test EPO's effects on ischemic neurovascular unit (NVU) injuries and examine whether
the effects were dependent on connexin43 (Cx43) mediated gap junctional intercellular communication
(GJIC). We detected the expression of Cx43 and phosphorylation of Cx43 (p-Cx43) at 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d
after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Meanwhile, we examined the effects of EPO on NVU
injuries including neuronal survival, astrocyte activation and regeneration of endothelial cells as well as
whether the effects were Cx43 dependent by using multiple inhibitors. We found EPO highly increased
p-Cx43, but not total Cx43 at all chosen times. Importantly, EPO led to neurological and bloodebrain
barrier functions improvement by associating with promotion of angiogenesis as well as reduction of
neuronal death, astrocyte activation and neurotoxic substances levels. Moreover, these effects were
significantly weakened by the inhibitors blocking GJIC, Cx43 communicative function, phosphorylation
and expression, only Cx43 redistribution inhibitor excluded. Our data suggest the protective effects of
EPO on NUV injuries are highly associated with the increase of p-Cx43, which improves GJIC to reduce
neurotoxic substances.

1. Introduction
Erythropoietin (EPO) was originally recognized as the major
hormone that stimulated and regulated the production of red blood
cells. Now, more and more research supports the protective effects
of EPO in cerebral ischemic models with multiple mechanisms [1].
Over the past 10 years, studies of the blood vessel in cerebrovascular
disease have expanded from consideration of only endothelial
cells to include interactions with neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and
extracellular matrix, thus the term “neurovascular unit (NVU)” is
established. Several studies have reported EPO protects neuron and
endothelial cells as well as attenuates astrogliosis respectively
[2e4]. However, little research has systematically investigated the
effects of EPO on NVU as a whole and the involved mechanisms
remain unknown.
Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) mediates
electronic coupling and permits rapid propagation among cell
networks. Connexin43 (Cx43) is the primary component protein in
astrocytic gap junctions, which allows the passage of ions and small
molecules [5]. During focal cerebral ischemia, the predominant
change of NVU is disruption of its structural integrity and
enhancement of bloodebrain barrier (BBB) permeability [6].Itis
also reported Cx43 knockout mice exhibited mostly reduction of
intercellular communication and weakened the BBB, suggesting
Cx43 regulates the integrity of the BBB, as well as the homeostasis
of NVU [7].

It is investigated that EPO can up-regulate Cx43 expression [8].
Based on the evidences that EPO is closely related with Cx43, as
well as both of them are essential to NVU, we speculate that the
effect of EPO on NVU following cerebral ischemia may result from
regulating Cx43 expression. However, it is still controversial how
Cx43 acts on cerebral ischemia. It was shown that Cx43 knockout
exacerbated ischemic injury [9]. On the other hand, Cx43 inhibitor
was exhibited protective effects after cerebral ischemia [10]. More
importantly, intracellular redistribution and phosphorylation of
Cx43 may be two crucial forms to develop its function following
cerebral ischemia [11,12]. Therefore, we suspect that EPO may influence ischemic NVU damage via changing the special forms of
Cx43.
To test these hypotheses, the effect of EPO on NVU after ischemic
injury was first investigated. We subsequently selected specific
inhibitors to suppress GJIC, Cx43 communicative function, redistribution
, phosphorylation and expression, then explored the
involved mechanisms through observing the effects of these
inhibitors.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and experimental groups
Male SpragueeDawley (SD) rats weighing 280e300 g provided
by the Experimental Animal Center of Guangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine in China were housed in temperature (22±2C)
and humidity controlled (55 ± 5%) rooms. All animal experiments
were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine.
Rats were randomly divided into eight groups: Group 1: Sham
operation. Group 2: middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Group 3: MCAO plus EPO. Group 4: MCAO plus EPO plus carbenoxolone
(CBX, SigmaeAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, a GJIC inhibitor).
Group 5: MCAO plus EPO plus Cx43 mimetic peptide (CMP, also
called Gap26, APExBIO, Houston, TX, USA, a Cx43 inhibitor). Group
6: MCAO plus EPO plus Dynasore (SigmaeAldrich, a Cx43 redistribution
inhibitor). Group 7: MCAO plus EPO plus Ro318220 (SigmaeAldrich, a protein kinase C (PKC) ε inhibitor). Group 8: MCAO
plus EPO plus Cx43 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The parameters
were detected at 1 d, 3 d and 7 d after MCAO and each parameter of
each group contained six rats.
2.2. Rat MCAO model and drugs injection
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally) and the left common carotid artery (CCA), the
external carotid artery (ECA), and the internal carotid artery (ICA)
were exposed. A length of 3.0 monofilament nylon suture
(18.5e19.5 mm) with its tip rounded by heating near a flame, was
advanced from the ECA into the lumen of the ICA until it blocked
the origin of MCA. 1.5 h after MCAO, reperfusion was initiated by
withdrawal of the suture until the tip cleared the lumen of the ECA.
Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same surgical procedure
but the suture was not introduced. Recombinant human
EPO (rhEPO, Sunshine Pharmaceuticals, Shenyang, China) was
injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 5000 IU/kg at 2 h after
reperfusion and daily afterward for 7 d. The drugs including CBX
(1.5mg/g), CMP (3.5mg/g), Dynasore (50 ng/g) and Ro318220 (4 ng/
g) were injected intracerebroventricularly immediately after
reperfusion with a stereotaxic frame (Alctt Biotech, Shanghai,
China) at 1.5 mm lateral to the midline, 1.5 mm posterior to the
coronal suture and at a depth of 3.5 mm from the surface of the
brain. The doses of drugs were according to our preliminary experiments
and previous reports [13e17].
2.3. SiRNA
This section was prepared as previously reported [18]. ONTARGET
plus SMARTpool Cx43 siRNA was purchased from
Thermo Scientific (Grand Island, NY, USA). Single deprotected
strands were resuspended with an isotonic buffer to a concentration
of 1 mg/ml. The strands were incubated at 90 C for 5 min and
then at 37 C for 1 h. SiRNA was prepared immediately before
administration by mixing the RNA solution (1 mg/ml in annealing
buffer) with the transfection reagent i-Fect (v/v: 1/3; Neuromics,
Edina, MN, USA) to a final siRNA/lipid complex concentration of
0.25 mg/ml. Cx43 siRNA was infused intracerebroventricularly with
40 ml per rat at 1 d before MCAO.
2.4. Neurological testing
A standardized battery of behavioral tests was used to quantify
neurological function at 1 d, 3 d and 7 d after MCAO as reported by
Chen et al.[19]. The tests included motor tests, sensory tests, beam
balance tests, reflexes absent and abnormal movements. Neurological
function was graded on a scale of 0e18 (normal score: 0;
maximal deficit score: 18) and the higher score, the more severe
was the injury. Tests were conducted by an observer blinded to the
treatment groups.
2.5. Determination of BBB permeability with the use of Evans blue
Evans blue (EB, SigmaeAldrich) in normal saline was injected
intravenously. The rats were anesthetized 1 h later and perfused
with 200 ml of normal saline solution through the left cardiac
ventricle. The rats were decapitated and the tissue samples in the
peri-infarct area were obtained. The samples were homogenized in
methylformamide (1 ml/100 mg brain tissue), incubated for 24 h at
60C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The absorbance (A)of
supernatants was analyzed at 632 nm by spectrophotometry [20].
2.6. The intracellular free calcium ion concentration (i[Ca2þ])
examination
The determination of i[Ca2þ] was performed according to reported
protocol [21]. The single brain cell suspension was noninvasively
labeled with Fluo-3/AM at a concentration of 3 pM in
phenol red-free medium at 37 C for 1 h. This membrane nonfluorescent acetoxymethyl ester was converted to fluorescent
form by intracellular esterases. It then exhibited a 40-fold increase
in fluorescence intensity upon Ca2þ binding. Selected cells in each
chamber were scanned by the TCS SP2 (ElX¼ 488 nm; ElM¼ 530/
30 nm), and the fluorescent emission was monitored. Excitation
and detection parameters were kept constant in all experiments.
2.7. Determination of glutamate level
Glutamate level was measured using glutamate colorimetric
assay kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA). Sample homogenates
preparation and assays were performed as recommended by the
manufacturer. The level of glutamate in brain tissues was normalized
and expressed as mmol per g of total protein.
2.8. Western blot
Proteins (50 mg) were loaded onto 4% stacking/12% separating
SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis, and then transferred
onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes. After blocked, membranes
were incubated overnight at 4 C with anti-Cx43 and anti-p-Cx43
(both 1:1000, SigmaeAldrich) rabbit polyclonal antibodies.

Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:4000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The membranes were
placed into ECL solution for 5 min, and then exposed. The intensity
of blots was quantified using the Leica Image Processing and
Analysis System. b-Actin was used as an internal control.
2.9. Immunofluorescence
The sections were sequentially washed, blocked by 10% goat
serum, incubated overnight at 4 C with anti-Cx43, anti-p-Cx43
(both 1:500, SigmaeAldrich), anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein
(NeuN), anti-glialfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-CD31(all
1:500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then incubated 1 h a 37C
withfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) coupled secondary goat antirabbit
IgG (1:500, Invitrogen). The nuclei in Cx43 and p-Cx43 were
highlighted by stained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
2.10. Cell counting
For determining cell counting, coronal sections of 10 mmwere
cut from the optic nerve to mamillary body. Every tenth section was
chosen after the infarction area was first spotted and six sections
were selected altogether. Then six nonoverlapping fields per section
in the peri-infarct zone under high power lens (200 in NeuN
and GFAP staining and  400 in CD31 staining) were randomly
chosen. The average was regarded as the NeuN, GFAP or CD31
staining cell numbers.
2.11. Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± SEM and analyzed with
SPSS12.0. Differences between groups were compared by using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the ANOVA identified
significant between-group differences, Tukey's honestly significant
difference (HSD) tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Differences
were considered significant at P< 0.05. All analyses were
conducted by an observer blinded to the genotype of the mice.
3. Results
3.1. Expression of Cx43 in each group of rats
Both Western blot and immunofluorescence revealed an increase
of Cx43 in the peri-infarct area at 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after MCAO
(p < 0.01). RhEPO had no effect on Cx43 protein expression after

Ro318220 groups and EPO group, except a slight down-regulation by CBX and CMP at 3 d after MCAO (n ¼ 6, & p < 0.05 vs. EPO). Cx43 protein was hardly detected after RNA
interference (n¼ 6, #p < 0.01 vs. EPO). (IeK) Western blot images of 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after MCAO. (L) Semi-quantitive analysis.

MCAO at any time point. Administration of inhibitors including
CBX, CMP, Dynasore and Ro318220 did not change rhEPO's such
effect, except a slight down-regulation by CBX and CMP at 3 d after
MCAO (p < 0.05). Cx43 protein was hardly detected after RNA
interference. The statistical differences were found in semiquantitive
analysis of Western blot (Fig. 1).
3.2. Expression of p-Cx43 in each group of rats
Similar to the section before, p-Cx43 protein was strongly upregulated
after MCAO (p< 0.01). However, both Western blot and
immunofluorescence showed intraperitoneal injection of rhEPO
significantly increased p-Cx43 in the peri-infarct area at 1 d, 3 d,
and 7 d after MCAO (p< 0.01), which was far different from total
Cx43. Only intracerebroventricularly injected of Ro318220 and
Cx43 siRNA counteracted the effect of p-Cx43 up-regulation by
rhEPO (p < 0.01). Also, semi-quantitive analysis of Western blot
provided statistical differences (Fig. 2).
3.3. Neurological scores and EB extravasation amount in each
group of rats
Neurological scores and EB extravasation amount were
increased at 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after MCAO, while rhEPO attenuated
these effects (p < 0.01). Intracerebroventricularly injected of
inhibitors containing CBX, CMP, Ro318220 and Cx43 siRNA blocked
protective effects on neurological function and BBB integrity of
rhEPO at all the three time points (p< 0.01) (Fig. 3A, B).
3.4. i[Ca2þ] and glutamate levels in each group of rats
To investigate the effect of rhEPO on GJIC, we selected two
important neurotoxic substances Ca2þ and glutamate, which pass
into or out of cells though Cx43. As the neurotoxicity, an intensive
increase of them was detected at 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after MCAO
(p< 0.01). Levels of i[Ca2þ] and glutamate were reduced rhEPO at
the three time points (p<0.01). Furthermore, such neuropretective
effects were greatly weakened by CBX, CMP, Ro318220 and Cx43
siRNA (p< 0.01), only except Dynasore (Fig. 3C, D).
3.5. NeuN, GFAP, and CD31 staining in each group of rats
We evaluated neuronal injury using NeuN staining and positive
cells were survival neurons. GFAP is an astrocyte specific protein
and was used to label astrocyte activation in our study. CD31 is
predominantly expressed in neovascular endothelial cells, so we
used it to assess changes of these cells. The changing trend of NeuN
staining cells can be found in microscopic images and quantitive
analysis was made by means of positive cell counting. There was a
decrease of NeuN with an increase of GFAP and CD31 staining at 1 d,

3 d, and 7 d after MCAO (p < 0.01). RhEPO increased NeuN and
CD31, while reduced GFAP staining (p < 0.01), which was attenuated
by the inhibitors containing CBX, CMP, Ro318220 and Cx43
siRNA (p< 0.01) (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated EPO reduced neuronal death,
blocked astrocyte activation and protected structure and function
of endothelial cells in focal cerebral ischemic model. In the previous
research, similar results were revealed by separate experiments in
different CNS injury models [2e4,13]. Since neuron, astrocyte and
endothelial cell are most important components in NVU and our
results are in accord with previous work, wefirst disclosed EPO had
protective effects on NVU in one single model. Moreover, the three
time points selected in our study: 1 d, 3 d and 7 d after MCAO, are
just in phases of NVU injuries starting, aggravation and restoration
respectively, thus making possible to continuous observation of
NVU damage after MCAO in different typical pathological phases.
As the above effects were observed, we continuously investigated
the involved mechanisms.
Our results further indicated EPO reduced levels of i[Ca2þ] and
glutamate, which are essential neurotoxic substances passing into
or out of cells through GJIC to damage NUV after cerebral ischemia
[22]. It suggests regulation of GJIC may mediate EPO's protective
effects on ischemic NVU injuries. Of the gap junction proteins, Cx43
is the most ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in
astrocyte end-foot processes along blood vessels thus impacting on
BBB disruption and neuronal death [11]. So we focused the target
on Cx43. We demonstrated EPO had no effect on total Cx43
expression in peri-infarct area via immunofluorescence and
Western blot. The result is inconsistent with previous research,
which is probably owing to differences of drug injection ways
(intraperitoneal versus invenous) and pathological states (cerebral
ischemia versus myocardial Infarction) [8]. Because phosphorylation
is an important activated form, we further observed p-Cx43
expression and found EPO significantly up-regulation p-Cx43 after
MCAO. Moreover, effects of Cx43 itself on cerebral ischemia are still
controversial. It was found Cx43 deletion worsened neuronal
apoptosis after MCAO [9]. However, other studies revealed that in
ischemic models, Cx43 blockade improved outcomes and Cx43
knockout reduced neuronal apoptosis [10,14]. So Cx43 seems to
have dual influence on cerebral ischemia and the influence, to some
degree, is complex and comprehensive. For this reason, we chose
multiple inhibitors to explore effects of Cx43 through different
ways.
We selectedfive different inhibitors in total. CBX is well known
as a common GJIC blocker, used to block cell-to-cell communication
[23]. CMP is a mimetic peptide corresponding to a short linear
sequence in the first extracellular loop of Cx43, used to block
intracellular communication by Cx43[24]. Dynasore is an inhibitor
of dynamin GTPase activity, which reduced the association between
dynamin2 and Cx43. Considering dynamin2 may control
Cx43 invagination, endocytosis, recycling and degradation, we used
Dynasore to block Cx43 redistribution[25]. Increasing PKCεcontent
was associated with an increasing Cx43 phosphorylation and PKC

(n¼ 6,& p< 0.01 vs. sham operation). RhEPO significantly reduced neurological scores, EB extravasation amount, i[Ca2þ] and glutamate levels at each time point (n¼ 6, #p< 0.01
vs. MCAO), which was blocked by the inhibitors containing CBX, CMP, Ro318220 and Cx43 siRNA (n¼6, *p<0.01 vs. EPO). (A) Neurological scores. (B) EB extravasation amount. (C) i

inhibitor blocked Cx43 phosphorylation [26]. Thus PKCε inhibitor
Ro318220 was used to block Cx43 phosphorylation in the current
study. As is known, Cx43 siRNA can suppress Cx43 expression and
our results also showed Cx43 protein and phosphorylation were
hardly detected after administration of Cx43 siRNA. We demonstrated
CBX, CMP and Cx43 siRNA markedly attenuated EPO's
positive effects on NVU after MCAO, suggesting the intercellular
communicating function of Cx43-GJIC is involved in the above effects.
In addition, it was found in our study Ro318220 also weakened
EPO's effect, while Dynasore had no influence. Combined with
the up-regulation of p-Cx43 by EPO, it indicates EPO elicits its
protective effects on NVU after cerebral ischemia depending on
increase of p-Cx43 rather than Cx43 redistribution.
Cx43, as the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed connexin
, is known to be a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation of Cx43
can regulate connexin assembly into gap junctions, gap junction
turnover and channel gating, thus is important to elicit its biological
effects [27]. Previous studies showed decrease of Cx43 phosphorylation
after ischemia/hypoxia, leading to astrocytic death
[28]. It suggests Cx43 phosphorylation can develop neuroprotective
effects. Additionally, other neuroprotective factors, e.g.
nerve growth factor, also counteract the negative effects of
ischemic events by increasing Cx43 phosphorylation [29].
Meanwhile, different changing trend of phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated Cx43 by the same drug was also observed [30].
All the above findings were accordant with our results.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that EPO has protective effects
on NUV injuries following cerebral ischemia, which is closely
related with increase of p-Cx43, thus improve GJIC to reduce
neurotoxic substances. The current study provides double targets
to treatment of cerebral ischemia, which can present new insights
to drugs development. Future work may further verify the above
effects resorting to Cx43 knockout mice. Moreover, similar effects
can be investigated using cell culture models to obtain more evidences
and the related signal transduction pathways.
