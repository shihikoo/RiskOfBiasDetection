Abstract Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of
the medium- and large-sized arteries, is the main underlying
cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) most often leading to
a myocardial infarction or stroke. However, atherosclerosis
can also develop without this clinical manifestation. The pathophysiology
of atherosclerosis is very complex and consists of
many cells and molecules interacting with each other. Over
the last years, chemokines (small 8–12 kDa cytokines with
chemotactic properties) have been identified as key players
in atherogenesis. However, this remains a very active and
dynamic field of research. Here, we will give an overview of
the current knowledge about the involvement of chemokines
in all phases of atherosclerotic lesion development. Furthermore
, we will focus on two chemokines that recently have
been associated with atherogenesis, CXCL12, and macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Both chemokines
play a crucial role in leukocyte recruitment and arrest, a critical
step in atherosclerosis development. MIF has shown to be
a more pro-inflammatory and thus pro-atherogenic
chemokine, instead CXCL12 seems to have a more protective
function. However, results about this protective role are still
quite debatable. Future research will further elucidate the precise
role of these chemokines in atherosclerosis and determine
the potential of chemokine-based therapies.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) [1], the leading cause of death worldwide accounting
for more than 15 million deaths annually [2]. Most
commonly, CVD results in a myocardial infarction (MI) or
stroke but can also develop without clinical manifestations.
Over the years, a lot of research has been performed to better
understand the pathology behind CVDs. Atherosclerosis is a
chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by the accumulation
of lipids, immune cells, and cell debris in the vessel wall.
This will form atherosclerotic lesions that can grow over time
and eventually occlude an artery. However, more frequently,
these lesions rupture, causing thrombus formation [1]. The
occlusion will cause ischemia in downstream tissues, resulting
in cardiovascular events. At present, atherosclerosis cannot be
reversed by medical treatment, warranting the need for better
understanding of this pathology in order to develop new strategies
to combat this deathly disease. In this review, we will
specifically focus on the role of chemokines and their receptors
in atherosclerosis, as they have been shown to play crucial
roles in the initiation, progression, and even regression of
atherosclerotic lesions. Finally, CXCL12 and macrophage

migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which have been recently
associated with CVD, will be more elaborately discussed.
Chemokines
Chemokines are small molecules (8–12 kDa) that are the largest
family of cytokines [3]. Based on the position of the N-
terminal cysteine residues, this family can be divided into four
canonical subclasses, being C, CC, CXC, and CX
3
C [ 4].
Characteristic for all chemokines is that they exert chemotactic
effects on cells, in contrast to regular cytokines like IL-10
or IL-12 that do not mediate this cell attraction. Recently, a
group of cytokines was identified that share functional similarities
with chemokines as they exert some chemokine-like
functions like chemotaxis [5]. However, these cytokines could
not be under divided into one of the canonical subclasses, as
they did not contain the specific N-terminal cysteine residue.
Therefore, these cytokines were classified into a newly defined
fifth subclass, called the Bchemokine-like function^
(CLF) chemokines [5]. Most receptors for chemokines, called
chemokine receptors, are G protein-coupled receptors. Therefore
, upon chemokine binding, these receptors will activate G
proteins and thus downstream intracellular signaling. However
, also G protein-independent, atypical chemokine receptors
have been described. These receptors mainly function as scavenger
receptors for chemokines [6]. Chemokines and their
receptors are widely expressed and are prominently present
on cells that play a crucial role in atherosclerosis development
like endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and
leukocytes [7]. Chemokines play an important role in all
stages of atherosclerosis development (Fig. 1).
Chemokines in atherosclerosis initiation
Atherogenesis generally starts with EC damage, resulting in
an increased permeability of the endothelial layer, leading to
the accumulation of lipids, especially low density lipoproteins
(LDL) in the intima [8]. LDL in the subendothelial layer is
very susceptible to oxidation, resulting in oxidized-LDL particles
(oxLDL) [9]. This modified LDL will be taken up by
resident macrophages and hydrolyzed into free cholesterol
and fatty acids [10, 11]. Subsequently, free cholesterol will
undergo re-esterification, forming cholesteryl esters [12].
Macrophages are not able to excrete these esters resulting in
continuous intracellular accumulation, transforming macrophages
into foam cells, which are characteristic of initial atherosclerosis.
Besides macrophage activation, ox-LDL has also
been shown to activate endothelial cells. A component of
LDL, lysophosphatidic acid, has been shown to release
CXCL1 from ECs [13], which has been shown to be important
for the mobilization of monocytes and neutrophils to the site
of inflammation via its receptor CXCR2 [13–15].
In response to the vascular inflammation caused by EC
and macrophage activation, mainly monocytes will be
attracted not only to the site of injury but also to other
immune cells like neutrophils, T- and B-lymphocytes [9].
Monocytes in the circulation are present in two main subtypes
, the classical (Ly6Chigh) and the nonclassical
(Ly6Clow) monocytes [16]. Classical monocytes are the
main subtype that will migrate toward atherosclerotic lesions
[17]. After this recruitment, monocytes will adhere
to the vessel wall and transmigrate into the intima of the
vessel by a process consisting of various interactions between
adhesion molecules and chemokines [18]. These interactions
are very complex, and although a lot of research
has already been performed in this area of interest, dogmas
continue to change, and there is still a lively debate about
the precise role of the various chemokines in this process.
This dynamics is clearly visible when we look at the literature
from the last 10 years focusing on the recruitment of
monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions. In 2007, Tacke et al.
showed that CCR2, CCR5 and CX
3
CR1 are required for
monocyte recruitment [19]. For this, they transferred atherosclerotic
aortic arches from ApoE−/− mice into the specific
chemokine receptor knockout mice. More recently,
however, using adoptive transfer experiments combined
with pharmacological inhibition, Soehnlein et al. showed
that not CCR2 or CX
3
CR1 but CCR1 and CCR5 are necessary
for monocyte recruitment [15]. Surprisingly, looking
at the role of CCR1 and CCR5 in general atherosclerosis
development, their role appears to be contradicting. Mice
deficient for CCR5 show reduced atherosclerosis development
upon high fat diet feeding, although CCR1-deficient
mice show clearly increased plaque development [20, 21].
Though these two receptors share ligands like CCL3 and
CCL5, they can also both bind specific ligands, which
might explain the differential outcome on atherosclerosis
development. Another possible explanation for this differential
involvement of CCR1 and CCR5 in atherosclerosis is
the contrary effects on the Th1/Th2 balance, with CCR1
deletion favoring a proatherogenic Th1 response [22]. Although
the adoptive transfer study did not show a role for
CCR2 in monocyte recruitment, CCR2-deficient mice do
show significantly reduced atherosclerosis development.
This could however be explained by a reduction of monocyte
release from the bone marrow in CCR2-deficient mice,
rather than inflammatory recruitment effects [23, 24]. These
data clearly indicate that chemokines do play an important
role in monocyte recruitment, although the precise interactions
still deserve further investigation (Fig. 1).
Recruited monocytes will start to adhere to the vessel wall
in a so-called capture and rolling process. During this process,
various chemokines, but especially also selectins present on

the activated endothelium, play an important role [25]. Subsequently
, monocytes will firmly adhere to the endothelium
via interactions of endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule
1 (VCAM1) with monocyte very late antigen 4 (VLA4) and
endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) with
monocyte lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1)
[26]. Finally, monocytes will transmigrate across the endothelial
layer again under the influence of chemokines [27]. Besides
the influence of chemokines, also the permeability of the
endothelial layer is very important in this phase. Therefore,
junctional molecules like VE-Cadherin and junctional adhesion
molecules (JAMs) are important in mediating this transmigration
into the intima of the vessel wall [28]. In the intima,
monocytes will differentiate into macrophages, mediated by
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) [29]. These
newly formed macrophages will again be exposed to oxLDL
present in the intima which will as described before result in
the formation of foam cells. This vicious circle of lipid accumulation
and leukocyte recruitment will continuously stimulate
atherosclerosis development.
Chemokines in lesion progression and regression
Chemokines play a role not only in leukocyte recruitment and
adhesion but also during plaque progression. As a result of the
continuous accumulation of lipids and debris, lesional macrophages
will eventually become apoptotic. Neighboring macrophages
can take up the formed apoptotic debris in a process
called efferocytosis [30]. However, as more and more debris
will form upon lesion progression, neighboring macrophages
will become stressed, impairing their efferocytotic capacity
[31]. Apoptotic macrophages will then go into secondary necrosis
, forming a necrotic core [30,32]. It has been shown that
CX
3
CR1 plays an important role in cell survival, as CX
3
CR1-
deficient mice showed an increased apoptosis of lesional macrophages
[33]. This effect on cell survival, rather than leukocyte
recruitment was the underlying cause of the observed
reduction in atherosclerosis development in CX
3
CR1-deficient
mice [33].
Upon lesion progression, a fibrous cap is formed to protect
the lumen from the necrotic core, which contains thrombotic
Fig. 1 Role of chemokines in atherosclerosis. After endothelial cell
damage, LDL will migrate into the intima, where it will undergo
oxidation (1). Modified LDL will subsequently be taken up by
macrophages, forming foam cells (2). Lysophosphatidic acid, a
component of LDL, induces endothelial CXCL1 secretion to recruit
monocytes via CXCR2. CCR1 and CCR5 are crucial chemokine
receptors for leukocyte recruitment (3). Recruited leukocytes will
adhere to the vessel wall, using VCAM-1-VLA4 and ICAM1-LFA1
interactions (4). Continuous accumulation of lipids and debris will
eventually result in apoptosis of lesional macrophages. CX
3
CR1 is
important for monocyte survival, by protecting them from apoptosis (5).
Upon lesion progression, a fibrous cap is formed to protect the lumen
from the necrotic core. This cap consists of collagen and elastin, produced
by SMCs. CXCL10 inhibits SMC proliferation, thereby influencing
plaque stability (6). CCR7 can mediate monocyte/macrophage egress
from lesions (7). Upon lesion rupture, platelets adhere to the site of
injury, and a thrombus is formed (8). CXCL12, CCL17, and CCL22
play an important role in platelet activation and aggrevation. ICAM1

factors. This cap mainly consist of collagen and elastin, produced
by SMCs [34]. Fibrous cap thickness is often used as a
measure of lesion stability, where lesions with a thicker cap
are more stable and thus less prone to rupture. It has been
shown that CXCL10 plays an important, although detrimental
, role in this plaque stability [35]. Inhibition of CXCL10
results in relatively more SMCs, suggesting that CXCL10
itself will result in a thinner fibrous cap. This fibrous cap
thinning can also be caused by matrix metalloproteases 
(MMPs), produced by lesional macrophages or SMCs, that
can degrade the formed extracellular matrix [36]. The balance
between production and degradation determines the thickness
of the cap and thus stability of the lesion. Vulnerable lesions,
consisting of a thin fibrous cap, are very likely to rupture and
cause an occlusion of the blood vessel resulting in a cardiovascular
event [32].
Platelets play a crucial role in this thrombus formation after
the rupture of atherosclerotic lesions. Various chemokines are
involved in the activation and aggregation of platelets [37].
CXCL12 is one of the chemokines able to induce platelet
aggregation [38]. Blocking studies additionally showed that
also the receptor for CXCL12 and CXCR4, expressed on
platelets, is crucially involved in the platelet aggregation effects
of CXCL12 [38]. Additionally, it has been shown that
CXCL12 is capable of stimulating platelet migration and
transmigration [39]. The macrophage-derived chemokines
CCL17 and CCL22 have also been demonstrated to induce
platelet activation via their receptor CCR4 [37].
Chemokines also play an important role in the regression of
atherosclerotic lesions. Various studies have already described
that CCR7 is crucial for the egress of macrophages, resulting
in plaque regression [40–42].
Together, these results show a clear involvement of the
chemokine system in all stages of atherosclerosis development
(Fig. 1). However, further research is still needed to
elucidate various contradicting findings and to fully understand
the precise role of these complex interactions. Recent
years, CXCL12 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor
(MIF) have gained a lot of interest in the field of atherosclerosis
research. Therefore, the remainder of this review will
discuss the current knowledge about these chemokines and
their receptors in relation to atherosclerosis and the clinical
implications.
CXCL12—general signaling and function
CXCL12 or stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is a member
of the CXC chemokine family [43]. This chemokine consists
of various isoforms. The two classical isoforms, which are
expressed throughout the body and are functionally indistinguishable
, are CXCL12-α and CXCL12-β [44]. However,
also CXCL12-γ, CXCL12-δ, CXCL12-ε, and CXCL12-φ
isoforms exist that are not as widely expressed and until
now much less studied [44]. CXCL12-deficient mice are embryonically
lethal, indicating the general physiological importance
of this chemokine [45]. CXCL12 especially plays an
important role in stem- and progenitor cell mobilization as
high levels of CXCL12 will retain cells in the bone marrow
[46]. In the clinic, this is already being exploited by modulating
CXCL12 by using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) to induce stem cell recruitment, reviewed in [47].
CXCR4 is expressed in a wide variety of cells and is the
main receptor for CXCL12 [48, 49]. Since CXCR4 is a G
protein-coupled receptor, it can mediate intracellular signaling
via G proteins [48]. G proteins consist of various subunits.
Signaling via CXCR4 seems to be mainly mediated by the
Gα
i
subunit. Upon binding of CXCL12 to this receptor, G
proteins not only dissociate and can trigger MAPK and
PI3K signaling but also inhibit adenylyl cyclase [50]. Other
G protein subunits, the Gβγdimer, can also be activated upon
ligand binding, resulting in the mobilization of intracellular
calcium by phospholipase C activation [50]. Finally, CXCR4
has also been shown to induce β-arrestin recruitment [51].
Recruitment of β-arrestin to CXCR4 will mediate receptor
desensitization by the endocytosis of the receptor (Fig. 2).
Another receptor for CXCL12, with even a 10-fold higher
affinity compared with CXCR4, is CXCR7 [52]. However,
CXCR7 does not induce intracellular signaling using G proteins
like CXCR4 upon binding of CXCL12. The main effect
of CXCR7 activation isβ-arrestin recruitment, resulting in the
internalization and subsequent degradation of the receptor
with its bound ligand [53, 54]. In this way, CXCR7, acting
as a decoy receptor, controls the availability of extracellular
CXCL12 and has been implicated in cell growth and survival
[55] (Fig. 2). It has been shown that both receptors for
CXCL12 also interact with each other in an antagonistic manner
[56, 57].
CXCL12 in atherosclerosis
In recent years, more research has focused on determining the
role of CXCL12 in atherosclerosis development. Mice that
were injected with CXCL12 developed more stable atherosclerotic
lesions, characterized by a thicker fibrous cap [58].
This beneficial effect on atherosclerosis could be explained by
the increased recruitment of SMC progenitor cells (SPCs) to
these lesions. Beneficial effects of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis
were also observed using endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
[59], indicating that the effects on progenitor mobilization of
this axis work atheroprotective.
CXCL12 and its main receptor CXCR4 are expressed on
various atherosclerosis-related cell types, like ECs, SMCs,
and leukocytes [60–63]. The exact causal role of cell-typespecific
CXCL12/CXCR4 expression remains to be

(TRIAL VER. PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1328679245)
elucidated. However, already various studies have showed
clear associations of cell-type-specific expression of CXCL12
with atherosclerosis development. In macrophages, for example
, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has been implicated in
macropinocytosis and could thus play an important role in
the accumulation of oxLDL and foam cell formation [64]. It
has also been implicated in neutrophil release from the bone
marrow as well as in the clearance of senescent neutrophils
from the circulation [65, 66]. Treating atherosclerotic prone
mice with a CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, resulted in increased
atherosclerotic lesion areas due to increased neutrophil
mobilization [67]. Furthermore, oxLDL stimulation of
ECs resulted in an increased release of CXCL12 [68], and
chemotaxis of lymphocytes was stimulated by the CXCL12/
CXCR4 axis [69–72]. These results clearly show that the
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis influences many cell types and plays
an important role in atherogenesis. The alternative receptor for
CXCL12 and CXCR7 has also been implicated in atherosclerosis
development, as activation of this receptor reduced lesion
formation, by increasing the VLDL uptake in adipose
tissue [73].
In humans, there are also already clear associations between
CXCL12 and atherogenesis revealed by genome-wide
association studies [43] and immunohistochemical stainings
of human lesions, showing more CXCL12 expression in atherosclerotic
lesions, compared to normal vessels [38]. This
role for CXCL12 in atherogenesis is also confirmed in other
human studies, although the clinical findings remain rather
contradictory. Angina patients show decreased plasma levels
of CXCL12, compared to healthy controls, with a decreased
surface expression of CXCR4 in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, indicating atheroprotective effects of CXCL12 [74].
In contrast, angina patients show increased platelet expression
of CXCL12, compared to healthy controls, and plasma
CXCL12 levels correlate with platelet activation, suggesting
more pro-atherogenic effects of CXCL12 [75]. Future research
is necessary to further elucidate these contradicting
clinical findings. As platelet-derived CXCL12 expression occurs
within 30 min after vessel injury, this chemokine might
be a suitable candidate to function as early biomarker [76,77].
MIF—general signaling and function
The MIF chemokine is missing the characteristic N-terminal
cysteines and therefore part of the CLF chemokine family
[78]. Originally, T cells were identified as the main source of
MIF, although in recent years, various studies have shown
MIF expression in many other leukocytes, like monocytes,
neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B cells [79]. MIF has shown
to be an pro-inflammatory chemokine, as it not only induces
the production of various cytokines and nitric oxide but also
overrides the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids
[80].
CD74, a MHC class II chaperone, was the first identified
receptor for MIF [81]. Although MIF binds with high affinity
to this receptor, it is not able to induce intracellular signaling.
For this, co-receptors are necessary like CD44, CXCR2, or
CXCR4 [5]. The CD74/CD44 complex has been linked to cell
proliferation and survival via MAPK and PI3K signaling,
Fig. 2 Signaling by MIF and
CXCL12. MIF binds to CXCR2,
CXCR4, and CD74 receptors,
whereas CXCL12 binds to
CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCR2
and CXCR4 induce G proteincoupled
signaling leading to
effects on survival, proliferation,
and chemotaxis. CD74/CD44
mediates similar effects in a G
protein-independent manner.β-

respectively [82, 83]. Additionally, CD74 has been shown to
play a role on monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis and arrest
[84]. As the CD74/CXCR2 complex is implicated in MIF-
mediated chemotaxis, these receptors are associated with atherosclerosis
[85]. CXCR4 by itself can also act as receptor for
MIF and seems to be especially important for MIF mediated T
cell recruitment [84]. In contrast, CXCR2 is the MIF receptor
responsible for not only monocyte recruitment but also
integrin activation, a critical step in firm adhesion of monocytes
to the endothelium [84]. CXCR2 is also a G proteincoupled
receptor and is capable of inducing intracellular signaling
[78](Fig.2).
MIF in atherosclerosis
It has been shown that MIF expression in atherosclerosisrelated
cells, like ECs, SMCs, monocytes, and T cells, positively
correlates with atherosclerosis progression, implicating
MIF in atherogenesis [86–88]. MIF has also been shown to
increase the adhesion of monocytes to aortic ECs in in vitro
adhesion assays under flow [89]. MIF also interfered with the
expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines that are important
mediators of leukocyte recruitment, as RNA-silencing
of MIF decreased the expression of E-selectin, ICAM1,
VCAM1, IL-8, and CCL2 [90]. Even more convincing results
are given by Bernhagen et al., where they show that MIF
triggers monocyte, neutrophil, and Tcell arrest and chemotaxis
in an integrin-dependent manner [84]. The role of MIF in
atherogensis was also confirmed in mouse models, where MIF
deficiency resulted in a reduction of lipid deposition and atherosclerotic
lesion size compared to wild-type mice [91]. MIF
inhibition by neutralizing antibodies showed similar effects on
atherogenesis, mainly mediated by a reduction in lesional inflammation
[86]. MIF is also associated with plaque destabilization
, as it has been shown that MIF stimulates not only
oxLDL uptake by macrophages but also MMP secretion [91].
The receptor for MIF, CXCR2, has also been implicated in
atherosclerosis as CXCR2 deficiency results in reduced lesion
size and lesional macrophage content [92]. Together, these
results clearly show pro-atherogenic effects of MIF and its
receptors.
MIF is also abundantly expressed in every stage of plaque
development in humans [87]. However, MIF seemed to play a
more important role in vulnerable lesions as it induces MMP-1
expression and activity in SMCs, leading to fibrous cap thinning
[93]. Plasma levels of CVD patients also showed increased
MIF levels, compared to healthy controls, associating
MIF with CVD development in humans [94]. In CVD patients
with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus,
high plasma MIF levels were even shown to be an independent
risk factor for future cardiovascular events [95]. This proatherogenic
role of MIF has also been confirmed by human
epidemiological studies, showing that a single nucleotide
polymorphism in the MIF gene associated with a significantly
increased risk for MI [96]. In support of this, MI patients have
increased plasma MIF levels as early as 4 to 6 h after acute MI,
making MIF a suitable candidate to be used as early detection
marker of MI [97]. However, a prospective study has warranted
caution to use MIF as a biomarker as there was only a very
weak association of MIF with risk of MI or death due to CVD
in humans without prior history of CVD [98].
Concluding remarks
It is well known that chemokines play an important role in
atherosclerosis and thus CVD. However, the interactions not
only between the various chemokines but also between the
various involved cell types in atherogenesis remain very complex.
As seen over the last years, dogmas with regard to this
interaction are still highly dynamic, and further research will
be necessary to fully elucidate these interactions. There are
already some potential therapies developed, targeting the chemokine
system. However, the development of effective but
safe therapeutics has shown to be rather challenging [99].
For MIF, also several inhibitors have already been developed
showing beneficial effects in various inflammatory models
[100]. Future research should further determine the therapeutic
potential of chemokines in atherosclerosis. An important
part of this will be the identification of cell-type-specific effects
of chemokines and their receptors, creating opportunities
for more specific therapeutic targets.
