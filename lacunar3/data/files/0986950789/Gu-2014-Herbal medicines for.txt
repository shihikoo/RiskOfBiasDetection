Abstract Stroke is a debilitating disease for which limited
therapeutic approaches are available currently. Thus, there is
an urgent need for developing novel therapies for stroke.
Astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes constitute a
neurovascular network for metabolic requirement of neurons.
During ischemic stroke, these cells contribute to postischemic
inflammation at multiple stages of ischemic cascades.
Upon ischemia onset, activated resident microglia and
astrocytes, and infiltrated immune cells release multiple inflammation
factors including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes
, free radicals and other small molecules, not only
inducing brain damage but affecting brain repair. Recent
progress indicates that anti-inflammation is an important therapeutic
strategy for stroke. Given a long history with direct
experience in the treatment of human subjects, Traditional
Chinese Medicine and its related natural compounds are recognized
as important sources for drug discovery. Last decade,
a great progress has been made to identify active compounds
from herbal medicines with the properties of modulating postischemic
inflammation for neuroprotection. Herein, we discuss
the inflammatory pathway in early stage and secondary
response to injured tissues after stroke from initial artery
occlusion to brain repair, and review the active ingredients
from natural products with anti-inflammation and neuroprotection
effects as therapeutic agents for ischemic stroke.
Further studies on the post-ischemic inflammatory mechanisms
and corresponding drug candidates from herbal
medicine may lead to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies in stroke treatment.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the most common diseases that cause
death and disability worldwide, which brings a hard burden
for family and society (Johnston et al.2009a,b). It starts with
sudden cessation of blood flow, oxygen, glucose and energy
in lesion area, followed by series pathologic biochemical
events called “ischemic cascades” including glutamateinduced
exitotoxicity, calcium influx, inflammation response,
blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, edema and cell death
(Eltzschig and Eckle 2011;Xingetal.2012).
Injured brain is highly modulated by immune response,
although it was considered as an immune-privileged organ for
many years. As the major components of blood–brain barrier
(BBB), microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes play
critical roles in maintaining immune quiescence in central
nerve system (CNS). In cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) injury, inflammation is an important pathological process
contributing to neuronal cell death and neurovascular injury as
well as affecting the progress of neurogenesis and brain repair.
Post-stroke inflammation process is involved in multiple cells.
Not only resident inflammatory cells like microglia, but infiltrated
blood borne macrophages and neutrophils participate in
the inflammation response (Huang et al. 2006; Lakhan et al.
2009; Jin et al.2010; Iadecola and Anrather2011; Kamel and
Iadecola 2012;Shichitaetal.2012a; Brambilla et al. 2013;
Murray et al. 2013). As the components of neurovascular
network, endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes could regulate
the inflammatory response during cerebral I/R injury. In

addition, infiltration of immune cells such as auto-reactive T
lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells makes the relatively sterile
brain tissue more complicated in response to stroke.
Activated inflammatory cells secret many inflammatory factors
including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, free radicals
and other small molecules, subsequently facilitating inflammatory
process and accelerating the BBB breakdown, neuronal
cell death or affecting brain repair (Lambertsen et al.
2012). Therefore, targeting inflammation and related factors
could be a crucial therapeutic strategy for preventing and
treating brain damage and promoting brain repair.
Current therapeutic strategy has poor clinical outcome.
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the only
FDA approved drug, but its golden time window is within
4.5 h after ischemic stroke due to the potential risk of hemorrhagic
transformation. Targeting neuroinflammation appears
to be a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing brain
damage and promoting brain repair in post-stroke treatment.
Last decades, many chemical synthesized compounds have
been screened and some of the compounds are promising drug
candidates. However, it has still a long way for a drug candidate
to transform from bench to bedside. Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) is recognized as a drug discovery source.
TCM has been practiced for more than 2,000 years in China.
Herbal medicine therapy provides an alternative and promising
strategy for stroke (Chen 2012). There are many case
reports with the success of improving the recovery of neurological
functions. Some medicinal herbs are considered to be
effective to treat stroke patients. Although restrictive clinical
trials are needed to verify their efficacies, these medicinal
herbs have their unique values for seeking drug candidates.
In the past decade, a great progress has been made to identify
the anti-inflammation compounds from herbal medicine for
post-stroke treatment.
In the present study, we review current progress on the
inflammatory responses and the impacts of inflammation on
brain damages during cerebral I/R injury. After that, we review
recent studies on herbal medicines targeting inflammatory
mechanisms for ameliorating neurovascular injury and
induction of tissue repair.
Sources of Inflammatory Events in Post-Ischemic Brains
Brain cells in the ischemic core, the center of ischemic territory
, are died (necrotic cell death) within minutes due to
energy depletion. While in the penumbra area, where the
situation is different, the blood flow reduction is not sufficient
and neurons remain viable and salvageable but are stressed
and vulnerable to other pathogenic events during reperfusion
period (Lo et al. 2003; Pan et al. 2007). Molecular cues
generated, released and presented in inflammatory cells and
neurovascular cells located at intravascular area, vascular
wall, perivasular space and brain parenchyma activate innate
immunity and adaptive immunity, contributing tissue damage
and repair in penumbra. However, in different stages of ischemia
and reperfusion, inflammatory cells, molecular cues and
their roles are different. Herein, we summarize the different
sources of inflammatory events, relevant inducers and sensors
in different stages, as well as their roles in post-ischemic brain.
Inflammatory Signaling in Early Period of Ischemic Stroke
Inflammatory signaling starts from as early as minutes after
stroke onset. There are at least three inducers initiating inflammation
at early stage of ischemic stroke, including (1) shear
stress due to lower blood flow; (2) oxidative stress because of
disturbance of electron transfer in mitochondria from injured
neurons; and (3) hypoxia due to lower blood oxygen supply
(Carden and Granger 2000).
Mitochondria damage is an early event following cerebral
I/R. Insufficient blood flow due to artery occlusion leads to
much less glucose and oxygen, as well as lower ATP level. A
burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced from
oxygen in mitochondria during both ischemic and reperfused
period. Meanwhile, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by NO
synthase (NOS) which is activated during cerebral I/R.
Energy depletion brings reduced activity of sodium and calcium
pumps, resulting higher level of Ca2+. The elevated level
of intracellular Ca2+ is then exacerbated by the release of
glutamate and the activation of glutamate receptor. Hypoxia,
ROS, NO and Ca2+ overload can quickly induce mitochondrial
damages. For example, The high level of cytosolic Ca2+
can activate proteases and phospholipases, increase mitochondrial
permeability transition (MPT), decrease membrane potential
, and induce cell swelling (Borutaite et al. 2013). NO
inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (COX) by competition with
oxygen and sensitizes to hypoxic neuronal death (Mander
et al. 2005). Early cerebral ischemia is recently shown to
reduce the activity of complexes I in mitochondrial respiratory
chain and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(Suchadolskiene et al.2014). Early brain ischemia injury also
rapidly disrupts or changes mitochondrial membrane phospholipids
and induces free lipids accumulation (Muralikrishna
Adibhatla and Hatcher 2006). Furthermore, ROS, Ca2+ overload
and NO activate MPT pore in the inner mitochondria
membrane, resulting in mitochondria swelling and ATP depletion
(Javadov and Kuznetsov 2013). These factors produced
in early period of brain ischemia together contribute
to the enhanced permeability of mitochondrial inner membrane
, ATP depletion and neuronal death.
Meanwhile, mitochondrial dysfunction in early brain ischemia
amplifies inflammatory responses. Mitochondrial derived
ROS during early brain ischemia triggers the formation
of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing
1 and 3 (NLRP1, NLRP3) inflammasome complex

after focal brain ischemia (Abulafia et al. 2009;Zhouetal.
2011). Dysregulation of mitochondria activity by inhibition of
the voltage-dependent anion channel suppressed NLPR3
inflammasome activation, indicating that NLRP3
inflammasome senses mitochondrial dysfunction (Zhou et al.
2011). The NLPR3 is a platform for the maturation of proinflammatory
factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1β.Upondetecting
brain ischemia mediated cellular stress, NLPR3 recruits
the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1,
resulting in caspase-1 activation followed by processing of
inflammatory targets, such as IL-18 and IL-1β(Schroder and
Tschopp 2010;Atianandetal.2013). ROS production during
mitochondrial dysfunction also amplifies the responsiveness
to cytokine-induced inflammation through and NF-κBactivation
(Vaamonde-Garcia et al. 2012). In addition,
Mitochondrial ROS and Ca2+ are primary mediators of
TNF-α-mediated inflammatory responses (Dada and
Sznajder 2011). Therefore, dysfunction of mitochondria in
early period of brain ischemia is important for the induction
of inflammatory cascade, and augments mitochondrial oxidative
stress, promoting a vicious inflammatory cycle (Lopez-
Armada et al. 2013).
Platelets are the bridging components of thrombosis and
vascular inflammation. These inducers mediate homotypic
(platelet-to-platelet) and heterotypic (platelet-leukocytes or
platelet-endothelial cells) aggregation in occluded area, exacerbating
surrounding tissue injury (Delzoppo et al. 1991).
Upon activated by cerebral I/R, platelets express P-selectin
and CD40-ligand (CD40L) on the surface, through which
platelets interact with monocytes, granulocytes, endothelial
cells and platelets themselves (Cha et al. 2003; Hu et al.
2010). Soluble form of P-selectin and CD40L cleaved by
proteases also strongly affect adhesion and migration of inflammatory
cells (Zirlik et al.2007). Meanwhile, complement
is activated and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites are released
, leading to further platelets aggregation (Rink and
Khanna 2011).
Leukocytes are important inflammatory cells even at early
stage of post-stroke brain. Increased leukocytes were found in
the microvessels and cerebral parenchyma as early as 30 min
after artery occlusion onset (Ernst et al.1987; Delzoppo et al.
1991;Delzoppo1994). In the luminal side of vascular wall,
endothelial cells attach leukocytes, providing a platform of
leukocytes homing, recruitment and infiltration. The low affinity
of leukocyte-endothelium interaction at early phase is
dependent on the binding of translocated P- and E-selectin on
endothelial cell surface with glycoproteins (P-selectin glycoprotein
ligand-1, PSGL-1) expressed on leukocytes, promoting
rolling and migration of leukocytes (Lawrence and
Springer 1991; Huang et al. 1999). The strong leukocyteendothelium
interaction relies on the later endothelial expression
of integrins, for example, intracellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) binding to leukocyte β2
integrin CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) (Vonandrian et al. 1991).
This firm binding strengthens the adherence of leukocyte to
vascular endothelium and results in conformational changes
of cytoskeleton to facilitate cell migration (Sobel et al. 1990;
Okada et al. 1996). Hypoxia-induced free radicals generation
leads to rapid and sustains up-regulation of selectins on leukocyte
surface (Okada et al. 1994; Cha et al. 2002). Hypoxia
also directly stimulates the increased expression of ICAM-1
and neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells via interactions
of CD11b/CD18 with ICAM-1 (Stanimirovic et al. 1997).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the activation
of infiltrated leukocytes (Chen and Nunez 2010).
Recruitment and activation of leukocytes and platelets in
response to oxidative stress induces the releases of cytokines,
chemokines, proteases and small molecules, leading to thrombosis
and BBB breakdown.
Mast cell is another responder to BBB leakage following
cerebral ischemia (Lindsberg et al. 2010). It accumulates in
perivasular area early after ischemia onset. Degranulation of
mast cells upon activation releases vasoactive components
like histamine and tissue necrosis factor (TNF), contributing
to vascular inflammation (Strbian et al. 2006). Both genetic
ablation and pharmacological inhibition of mast cells lead to a
significant reduction of gelatinase activity, BBB permeability
and cerebral edema (Strbian et al.2006; Lindsberg et al.2010;
Mattila et al. 2011). The leaky BBB facilitates the migration
and infiltration of leukocytes to brain parenchyma, which
exacerbates neuronal injury and brain edema, resulting in
secondary progression of infarct lesion in penumbra area.
In summary, during ischemic brain injury, early inflammation
is initiated from the vascular system by hypoxia, shear
stress and oxidative stress, sensed by non-transcriptional
events like adhesion molecules translocation in platelet and
leukocytes, amplified by transcriptional events and cytokines
and chemokines production. The initial inflammation could
promote the BBB disruption and the extravasations of inflammatory
cells, subsequently amplifying inflammation process
and exacerbating brain damages (Fig. 1).
Inflammatory Signaling in Secondary Response to Injured
Tissues After Stroke
In addition to the inflammatory factors from brain and circulating
immune cells, endogenous molecules from injured cells
in ischemic zones, designated as danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), can trigger inflammatory responses (Kono
and Rock 2008). Currently, identified DAMPs include heat
shock proteins (HSP) (Zheng et al. 2008), DNA or RNA
complex (Pisetsky 2013), heparin sulfate, oxidized lowdensity
lipoproteins (Chou et al. 2008), high-mobility group
box1 (HMGB1) protein (Yanai et al.2009) and peroxiredoxin
(Prx) family proteins. These DAMPs are normally host

components presenting ubiquitously in brain cells. After cerebral
I/R injury, the severely injured cells at ischemic core
area release their endogenous components. After cleavage,
modification, abnormal folding and resembling to new complex
, the DAMPs become to have antigenicity. HMGB1 is one
of the representative DAMPs involved in inflammation response
in ischemic brain (Kim et al. 2006; Hayakawa et al.
2010). HMGB1 was found within 2–4handdiminishedat
12 h in the ischemic brains (Zhang et al. 2011). Antibody
against HMGB1 significantly reduced BBB permeability
(Zhang et al. 2011) and infarction volume (Liu et al. 2007)
in rodent cerebral ischemic models, suggesting that HMGB1
could be a biomarker at early phase of cerebral ischemia and
potential therapeutic target in cerebral I/R injury.
Prx family proteins are another representative DAMPs
which are a group of ubiquitous anti-oxidative enzymes.
They are more abundant in brain than in other tissues. The
expression of Prx proteins were markedly increased at 12 h
and released from various types of necrotic brain cells after
cerebral ischemia (Shichita et al. 2012b). Prx proteins have
antioxidant activities (Patenaude et al. 2005) and promote
survival of neuronal cells (Rashidian et al. 2009).
Interestingly, a recent study reported that Prx proteins induced
the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and
triggered neuronal cell death (Shichita et al.2012b). Thus, Prx
proteins could have double-edge effects on ischemic brains.
The neuroprotective and neuro-deteriorated effects may depend
on their microenvironments. Intensive investigations are
necessary to further understand the functions of Prx proteins
in the pathological process of stroke.
DAMPs receptors can be the sensors in responding to
tissue injury. In addition to be activated by pathogens, Tolllike
receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, are involved
in non-infectious inflammatory status, such as cerebral
I/R injury (Bohacek et al. 2012;Wangetal.2013). Both Prx
proteins and HMGB1 can activate TLR2 and TLR4 in T cells
and macrophages. TLR2 and TLR4 knockout mice displayed
to have attenuated ischemic brain damage and inflammatory
response (Shichita et al. 2012b). In addition, as an HMGB1
receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) also contributes to the activation of several intracellular
inflammatory signal pathways including mitogenactivated
protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) (Lotze and Tracey 2005). Elevated HMGB1 and
soluble RAGE were found in the plasma obtained from patients
and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke
(Tang et al. 2013). Blocking RAGE signaling with either
antibody or genetic deficiency revealed to inhibit inflammation
and reduce infarction volume (Muhammad et al. 2008;
Zhang et al. 2011). Meanwhile, scavenger receptor A (SRA),
Mincle and CD36 may be the potential receptors for DAMPs
but their roles in cerebral I/R injury remain to be elucidated.
Fig. 1 Inflammatory signaling in early period of ischemic stroke. Within
minutes of brain ischemia, shear stress, hypoxia and oxidative stress
triggered by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion induce platelet aggregation
, platelet-endothelial cell aggregation, mast cell activation as well as
leukocyte homing, migration and infiltration. Adhension molecules such
as P-selectin and CD40L are translocated on membrane surface and
mediate platelet adhension. Leukocytes attach to endothelial cells in the
luminal side of vascular wall and infiltrate to brain parenchyma under
ischemia circumstance through weak interaction between P/E-selectin
and PSGL-1, or strong interaction between ICAM-1 and Mac-1. Meanwhile
, mast cells are activated by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, during
which, vasoactive components like histamine and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) are released to induce inflammation and BBB opening

In addition to the DAMPs released from cytosol and
nucleus, mitochondria also liberate molecules inducing
inflammation. Mitochondria are evolutionary derived
from bacteria and so might harbor DAMPs that are
similar to pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and formyl peptides
released from injured cells could trigger tissue
injury, and therefore they are also called DAMPs
(Raoof et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010b; Sun et al.
2013). They activate polymorphonuclear neutrophils
through formyl peptide receptor-1 and Toll-like receptor
TLR-9, respectively, resulting in PMN migration, degranulation
and neutrophil-mediated organ injury (Zhang
et al. 2010b). Oxidized mtDNA also activate NLRP3
inflammasome followed by activation of IL-1β and IL-
18. During cerebral I/R, mitochondrial DAMPs are released
, but the roles in the induction of inflammation
remains to be elucidated.
Disruption of mitochondria membrane and neuronal death
induced by ischemic cascade lead to release of nucleotides
such as ATP from the dead cells at ischemic zones could
exacerbate the inflammation process (Majumder et al. 2007;
Burnstock 2008). The extracellular parenchymal ATP activates
P2X7 receptor in microglia, activates interleukin-1-
converting enzyme (ICE, caspase-1) and facilitates the secretion
of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-1β
and IL-18 (Schock et al. 2007). A recent study provides
supportive evidence that endogenous inhibitor Milk fat
globule-EGF 8 (MFGE-8) inhibited inflammasome-induced
IL-1βproduction and attenuated post-ischemic cerebral injury
(Deroide et al. 2013).
Loss of cell-to-cell connection is another inducer conferring
inflammatory brain damage. Neuronal surface proteins
such as CD200 and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) interact
with the receptors CD200R and CX3CR1 on microglia,
respectively, maintaining microglia in a quiescent
(resting) state in normal condition (Hoek et al. 2000;
Cipriani et al.2011). In ischemic brain, however, microglial
cells are dramatically activated to release inflammation
factors due to the loss of interactions with neurons
(Cardona et al. 2006; Matsumoto et al. 2007).
In summary, secondary inflammatory response starts from
injured neurons in ischemia core. Released DAMPs and nucleotide
, as well as loss of neuron-microglia interaction are
inflammation inducers, while their receptors in the inflammatory
cells (perivascular macrophage, microglia, T cells, and
etc.) are sensors for inflammation production. These endogenous “ligands”and “receptors”together signal the response in
resident brain cells and infiltrated T cells, resulting in
inflammation-induced cell death in surrounding tissues
(Fig. 2). Therefore, inflammation activation from the injured
tissues is one of the causes of the spreading of neuronal injury
from ischemic core to surrounding penumbra.
Major Inflammatory Cells and Factors Underlying
Inflammation Process in Post-Ischemic Brain
In ischemic brain, inflammation responses include a rapid
activation of many resident cells, e.g. microglia and astrocytes
, followed by infiltration and activation of peripheral
inflammatory cells, e.g. macrophages and T lymphocytes. In
this part, we focus on the major inflammatory cells and
mediators for transduction of inflammation signals and their
impacts on resident brain cells during brain injury.
Major Inflammatory Cells
The nervous system and the immune system are engaged in
bi-directional crosstalk. Like other peripheral organs, CNS has
inflammatory cells participating in the process of tissue injury
and repair after stroke. The immune cells not only come from
brain but from peripheral blood. Moreover, inflammatory cells
from peripheral blood also regulate the immune status of CNS
in ischemic brain due to the disruption of BBB and following
infiltration of immune cells. Auto-reactive Tcells, monocytes,
mast cells and activated macrophages can pass through BBB
to induce inflammation.
Although the CNS was previously considered to be
immune-privileged, the emerging presence of microglia suggests
that the CNS and the immune system are tightly coupled.
Microglial cells are parenchymal tissue macrophages and
prime innate immune cells in CNS (Eggen et al. 2013).
Under homeostatic condition, microglia keeps in the ramified
(or treelike) morphology, the “resting”state, and displays little
or no immunomolecules. During CNS inflammation, resident
microglia performs normal surveillance. Microglia becomes
rapidly activated in response to brain injury, undergoing morphological
and molecular changes which often associated with
neurotoxicity. These changes are evident from postmortem
human brain specimens, animal models as well as the positron
emission tomography with radiolabeled benzodiazepine receptor
ligands in human patients (Schweitzer et al. 2010).
Microglia could have multiple functions in the ischemic damaged
brains. The beneficial, detrimental or dispensable effects
depend on local environmental signaling either directly from
damaged cells locally or the cells migrated from the surrounding
injured tissues (Aguzzi et al. 2013). During cerebral I/R
injury, these ramified resting microglial cells transit to activated
form rapidly in the acute phase (minutes to hours); peak at
48 to 72 h and last up to 16 weeks after ischemia (Denes et al.
2007; Lalancette-Hebert et al. 2007; Ekdahl et al. 2009). The
activated microglial cells could release numerous inflammation
mediators, growth factors, cytokines and neurotrophic
molecules etc. Those inflammation factors include TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6, ROS, nitric oxide (NO), and metal metalloproteinases
(MMPs), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), etc. The microglia

phenotypes have various physiological and pathological functions
, such as anti-inflammation, antigen presentation, phagocytosis
, synapse remodeling, which not only depend on local
neural environment but previous experience, making it more
complicated in response to ischemia-induced inflammation
response (Hanisch and Kettenmann 2007).
Astrocytes are the major glial cells in the brain. Astrocytes
take part in the formation of the glial scar during ischemia.
Like microglia, astrocytes also have DAMPs receptors and
purinergic receptor, and can secrete cytokines, chemokines
and NO upon activation (Swanson et al. 2004; Di Virgilio
et al.2009). Microglia are likely to be the major initial sensors
to danger signal and the secreted TNF-αand IL-1βcan act on
astrocytes to induce secondary amplified inflammatory responses
(Saijo et al. 2009; Glass et al. 2010). The activated
astrocytes de novo synthesize iNOS and NADPH oxidase to
produce NO and superoxide, respectively, subsequently inducing
peroxynitrite formation and releasing TNF-α and IL-
1β, resulting in detrimental effects on neurons and BBB
integrity (Glass et al. 2010).
Bone marrow derived macrophages and brain microglia
represent two genetically distinct myeloid populations
(Mildner et al.2011; Jefferson et al.2013). Peripheral macrophages
are derived from circulating mononuclear phagocytic
lineage in bone marrow, while brain microglia derive from
yolk sac (Wynn et al. 2013). However, it is difficult to distinguish
them in the brain due to the same cellular markers,
ramified morphology and phagocytic phenotypes, until the
development of chimeric mice with GFP bone marrow
(Schilling et al.2003,2005). With this powerful tool, previous
studies reported that peripheral macrophage recruitment was
slightly increased at the first 3 days and following dramatically
increased at day 3–7 after stroke (Petry et al. 2007;
Breckwoldt et al. 2008). Despite the macrophages-released
inflammatory factors are similar to the microglia-originated
one, the recruitment and activation of the inflammatory factors
at different time and various microenvironments in the injured
sites may lead to different functions (Jin et al.2010). Thus, it is
desirable to further explore the inflammatory responses under
different microenvironments in the ischemic brains with multidiscipline
approaches in future.
T lymphocytes are also important contributor to neuroinflammation
, especially in late post-stroke phase. In focal rodent
brain ischemia models, numerous T cells are recruited to
penumbra area after 3 days (Campanella et al. 2002; Xiong
et al. 2013). After subjected to cerebral I/R, mice with the
deficiency of CD3+,CD4 +and CD8+Tcells displayed the less
infarction volume, inflammation as well as neurological deficits
than wild-type littermates, indicating that T cellsmediated
neuroinflammation contributes to brain injury
(Xiong et al. 2013). Among them, Th1 cells may be a key
subtype of helper T cells that confer pathogenesis of stroke
through releasing IL-2, IL-12, TNF-α and interferon-γ
(IFN-γ). γδT cells, a small subset of uncommon T cells,
produce IL-17 and exacerbate neuronal injury (Shichita et al.
2009). In contrast, some subsets of different T cells may be

example, HMGB1, Prx family proteins and ATP. HMGB1 and Prx family
proteins interact with the DAMPs receptors TLR-2 and TLR-4, respectively

factors release.bNormally, neuron surface proteins CD200 and CX3CL1
interact with the receptors CD200R and CX3CR1 on microglia, respectively
, maintaining microglia in a quiescent state. During cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
, loss of neuron (and associated CD200 and CX3CL1) in
ischemia core leads to dramatic microglial activation, resulting in inflammatory
factors release

beneficial and have neuroprotective effects (Brait et al.2012).
Th2 was shown to protect neurons during cerebral I/R through
anti-inflammation (Yilmaz et al. 2006). Regulatory T cells
(Treg) play a pivotal role in suppression of neuroinflammation
and cerebral injury through releasing anti-inflammation factors
like TGF-β and IL-10, counteracting excessive production
of proinflammatory cytokines (O’Garra and Vieira2004;
Liesz et al. 2009).
Along with these major inflammatory cells, dendrite cells,
mast cells, endothelial cells, leukocytes and even B cells are
also involved in inflammation, disease progression or brain
repair in ischemic stroke (Jin et al.2010). These inflammatory
cells work synergistically to create a specific inflammatory
milieu, and play complicated and multi-phasic roles during
cerebral I/R injury.
Major Inflammatory Mediators
Inflammatory mediators, released by inflammatory cells, are
the key executors of inflammation-mediated cerebral injury
and repair. These factors include adhesion molecules, cytokines
, chemokines, proteases, growth factors, small molecules
and some other enzymes. Herein, we summarize the inflammatory
mediators contributing to ischemic brain injury
(Table1). The producing and releasing stages, producing cells
and major pathophysiological outcome are also discussed.
Adhesion molecules are a group of transmembrane proteins
involving in cell-cell or cell-matrix binding. Most of
adhesion molecules belong to immunglobulin superfamily,
such as integrins, selectins and cadherins. Among them, P-
selectin and E-selectin are up-regulated in the endothelial cell
surface in response to ischemia, providing a platform for
leukocyte adhension and platelet aggregation in the acute
and subacute phase (Delzoppo et al. 1991; Connolly et al.
1997). Meanwhile, ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cell
surface strengthens leukocyte adherence through interacting
with leukocyte CD11b/18Mac-1 (Vonandrian et al. 1991;
Connolly et al. 1996;Zirliketal.2007).
Cytokines are produced and released in response to antigens
and regulate innate and adaptive immunity. They are
dramatically increased in many brain diseases including
stroke. Cytokines are produced by microglia, endothelial cells,
astrocytes, macrophage, leukocyte and T cells. Among them,
the most well-studied cytokines are IL-1β,6,10,17,TNF-α
and TGF-β in the inflammation process of post-ischemic
brains. Within 24 h of experimental cerebral ischemia insult,
the levels of TNF-α,IL-1 β and IL-6 were found to be remarkably
increased up to 40 to 60 folds (Clausen et al. 2005;
Lambertsen et al. 2005). Elevated inflammatory factors were
also found in the samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid
from ischemic stroke patients and those inflammatory response
could be a predictor for early neurological deterioration
after stroke (Vila et al.2000;Simietal.2007; McCoy and
Tansey 2008;Whiteleyetal.2009). In the experimental stroke
animal models by using both genetic deficient mice and
pharmacological intervention, elevated TNF-α,IL-1 β levels
in the brain tissues were found to be highly correlated with the
enlargement of infarction volume (Barone et al.1997;Boutin
et al. 2001;Lambertsenetal.2002, 2009, 2012). Therefore,
these cytokines are ideal targets for drug discovery to combat
inflammation and protect ischemic brain (Table2). In contrast
to the consensus view of pro-inflammatory effect of TNF-α
and IL-1β, the roles played by IL-6 in experimental ischemic
stroke models are still controversial. One study showed that
there were no difference of infarction size and neurological
deficit score between wild-type and IL-6 knockout mice
(Clark et al. 2000), whereas a later study reported that IL-6
knockout mice exhibited increased infarct volume (Herrmann
et al.2003). In addition, IL-10 and TGF-βare also considered
to be neuroprotective factors, while as IL-17, IL-23, IFN-γ
and CD40/CD40L are neurotoxic (Table 1).
Other inflammation related factors include chemokines,
growth factors and many other small molecules during cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury. Chemokines secreted by immune
cells usually act as chemo-attractants to guide cell migrations.
Chemokines like CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-α, CX3CL1/
Fractalkine and CXCL8/IL-8 were increased in the ischemic
brains at acute and subacute stages. These secreted chemokines
can induce the rolling and adhesion of leukocytes on endothelial
cells and help leukocyte infiltration, exacerbating inflammation
response and neuronal injury. At the late stage (2 days
or more) of cerebral ischemia, growth factors including BDNF,
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), neuronal growth factor (NGF),
glia-derived growth factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor
(HB-EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are
produced in both CNS and peripheral cells. They function as
the factors of anti-inflammation, neuroprotection, angiogenesis
and neurogenesis. In addition, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, has
pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects, which is produced
by microglial cells to catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
acid to prostaglandins (Ikeda-Matsuo 2013). Nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is another important factor
which is activated in response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 can
induce transcription of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), an antioxidative
enzyme responsible for degradation of extracellular
heme, and exerts anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective
effects (Innamorato et al. 2008; Syapin 2008).
We then specifically discuss the roles of free radicals in
inflammation and brain damage during cerebral I/R injury.
Free radicals include ROS and reactive nitrogen species
(RNS). ROS include hydroxyl radical, superoxide, singlet
oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide. Reperfusion period following
brain ischemia insults induces the accumulation of

excessive free radicals, leading oxidative stress and neuronal
damages in ischemic brains (Heo et al. 2005). Superoxide
(O
2
–) produced by activatednicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is one of the main sources of
ROS in cerebral I/R. Accumulation of free radicals can trigger
numerous molecular cascades and induce inflammation, subsequently
increasing BBB permeability, brain edema and hemorrhage.
As representative RNS, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite
(ONOO-) also contribute to BBB disruptionand brain damages
during cerebral I/R injury. High concentration of NO derived
from nNOS activation and de novo synthesis of iNOS can
increase infarction volume (Murphy and Gibson 2007) and 
BBB permeability (Gursoy-Ozdemir et al. 2004). Matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) family proteins are the key targets in
RNS-mediated BBB opening and brain injury (Yang et al.
2007). As proteolytic zinc-containing enzymes, activating
MMPs can induce the degradation of the extracellular matrix
around cerebral blood vessels and neurons. Both NO and
ONOO- can activate MMPs and degrade tight junctions
(TJs), leading to BBB breakdown, brain edema, hemorrhage
transformation in cerebral I/R injury (Yang et al. 2007).
Our recent studies draw attention to the roles of caveolin-1
(cav-1), an integral plasma membrane protein, in inhibiting
MMPs and maintaining BBB integrity during cerebral I/R
injury (Shen et al. 2006;Guetal.2012). The interactions of
NOS, cav-1 and MMPs are critical cellular signaling pathways
in regulating BBB permeability and infarction size during
cerebral I/R injury (Gu et al. 2011). Cav-1 could prevent the
degradation of TJs and protect BBB integrity by inhibiting
iNOS activation and MMP activity. In experimental focal
cerebral I/R rat model, the expression of Cav-1 was remarkably
down-regulated in ischemic brains and the production of
NO induced the loss of cav-1 (Shen et al.2006). Further study
revealed that Cav-1 KO mice had higher MMPs activities and
BBB permeability than WT mice subjected to focal brain I/R
(Gu et al. 2012). Our studies indicate that cav-1 plays an
important role in maintaining BBB integrity through inhibition
of MMPs activity and protection of TJs.
In summary, during cerebral I/R injury, the inflammation
process is mediated by multiple molecular cascades and signaling
network systems. Inflammatory cells can be originally from
the immune cells in the CNS and peripheral systems. Those
molecular and cellular events exacerbate the inflammation and
brain damages after stroke. Thus, targeting those molecular and
cellular events may be important therapeutic strategies for drug
discovery from herbal medicine in stroke treatment.
Natural Compounds: Promising Candidates
for Anti-Inflammation and Neuroprotection

approved treatment for ischemic stroke and is strictly limited
within 3 or 4.5 h after ischemia onset. Thus, only a small
portion of patients can benefit from recombinant tPA treatment
(Lo2010; Moskowitz et al.2010). Therefore, there is an
urgent need to find efficacious therapy that extend the treatment
time window or replace tPA therapy. Early restoration of
blood flow is important to save the penumbra cells but accompanying
with reperfusion injury, i.e. free radicals accumulation
, and cytokines-mediated inflammation. Therefore, drug
discovery for preventing cerebral reperfusion injury is a promising
strategy for stroke treatment.
Chinese herbal medicine and other natural products, based
on thousands years of clinical treatment and prevention experience
, have many advantages to slow down or prevent inflammatory
insults and disease progression. In the past decades
, hundreds of compounds isolated from natural herbs or
foods have been identified to combat inflammation and protect
neurons in ischemic stroke. Many of those natural compounds
have already been used as healthy food supplements.
By searching PubMed database using general strings
(“Chinese Medicine” OR “Herbal medicine” OR “Natural
product” AND “brain ischemia”) and selecting through abstract
, we summarized total 55 natural compounds from herbal
medicines with the properties of anti-inflammation and have
neuroprotective functions for ischemic stroke. Table 2 shows
the active compounds categorized in accordance with chemical
structures information from representative sources, antiinflammatory
targets and related pharmacological effects.
These compounds can be categorized into phenolic compounds
, saponins, terpenoids and alkaloids whose structures
are shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6,and7. Some non-categorized
compounds with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects
are shown in Fig. 8. Herein, we selectively review the
pharmacological effects of the representative compounds
from herbal medicine on anti-inflammation and neuroprotection
and their potential applications for ischemic stroke
treatment.
Phenolic Compounds
It is well known that polyphenolic compounds have antioxidant
activities and their antioxidant activities generally contribute
to the anti-inflammation and neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Figures 3 and 4
show the representative phenolic compounds identified from
natural sources with the anti-inflammation and neuroprotective
activities. Flavonoids are typical phenolic compounds
ubiquitous in vegetables, nuts, seeds, vegetables and many
medicinal herbs. They can be divided into several groups
based on their chemical structures: isoflavones, flavonols,
flavonones and flavones. So far, there are more than 2000
natural flavonoids identified and many of them have a variety
of biological activities. The neuroprotective mechanisms of
flavonoids and other phenolic compounds are associated with
antioxidant and anti-inflammation through scavenging free
radicals, inhibiting inflammatory factors, and regulating transcriptional
factors, etc. Modifications of functional group of
hydroxylation, glycosylation or methoxylation result in the
diversity of the pharmacological functions (Fig. 3).
Puerarin, calycosin and genistein, a group of isoflavones,
have neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemiareperfusion
injury. Puerarin, an isoflavone enriched in
Pueriae Radix, was found to reduce infarction volume and
its neuroprotective mechanisms appear to be associated with
elevated expression of erythropoietin (EPO) and reduced level
of COX-2 in a rat model of ischemic brain injury (Gao et al.
2009; Lim et al. 2013). Genistein, a soybean isoflavone, was
found to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity and have neuroprotective
effects against I/R injury (Ma et al.2010; Castello-Ruiz
et al. 2011).
Flavonols are another group of flavonoids with antiinflammatory
effects, which are widely used as a complement
therapy for the patients of diabetics, cardiovascular diseases,
neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, etc. (Nieman et al.
2012). Quercetin is a common dietary flavonol supplement
existed in onions, broccoli, leafy green vegetables and medicinal
herbs with multiple bioactivities. A recent study showed
that administration of 2.7 mg/kg nanoencapsulated quercetin
reduced hippocampal damage, and decreased the expression
of MMP-9 and iNOS in the ischemia-reperfused brain from
both young and aged rats (Ghosh et al.2013). Fisetin, another
flavonol enriched in parrot tree, was found to protect brain
injury against cerebral I/R injury, accompanying with lowered
production and release of TNF-α as well as reduced infiltration
of macrophages and dendritic cells (Gelderblom et al.
2012).
Flavone is the major category of total flavonoids. Until
now, seven flavones have been reported to have antiinflammation
and neuroprotective effects. Baicalein, baicalin
and wogonin, three major flavones isolated from Chinese herb
Scutellaria baicalensis (Huang Qin), were shown to be neuroprotective
by scavenging ROS and RNS in experimental
cerebral ischemic models (Cho and Lee2004;Piaoetal.2004;
Zhu et al. 2012;Xuetal.2013). Baicalin was also shown in
our study to promote neuronal differentiation of neural
stem/progenitor cells (Li et al.2012c). In addition, in a recent
study, luteolin, enriched in Ixeris sonchifolia, was found to
activate Nrf-2 dependent transcription of HO-1 and had neuroprotective
effects against cerebral I/R injury in an experimental
ischemic stroke animal model (Zhang et al. 2013c).
Figure 4 shows other botanical poly-phenolic compounds
with the anti-inflammation bioactivities in literatures. Many of
them are revealed to inhibit the production of IL-1β,TNF-α,
IL-6, COX-1 and 5-lipoxygenase during animal brain ischemia
and reperfusion (Table 2). In particular, cinnamophilin
(80 mg/kg) administrated at 2, 4, or 6 h after ischemia onset
J Neuroimmune Pharmacol (2014) 9:313–339 325
(TRIAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1476067232)
remarkably reduced infarction volume and improved neurobehavioral
outcome in the rat model of cerebral ischemia (Lee
et al. 2009). It also attenuated oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD)-induced neuronal damage in rat hippocampal slices.
Mechanistically, cinnamophilin effectively inhibited the production
of TNF-α, nitrite/nitrate and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated macrophages and microglia cells (Lee
et al. 2009). In addition, hyperforin, a main active ingredient
of medicinal herb St John’s wort , was recently revealed to
protect brain tissues (Lin et al. 2013). With a transient focal
cerebral ischemia rat model, hyperforin, by intracerebroventricular
injection at ischemia onset, significantly reduced brain
infarction and apoptotic cells, associated with elevated transient
receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member
6 (TRPC6) and phosphorylated cAMP response elementbinding
protein (p-CREB) activity and decreased spectrin
breakdown proteins (SBDP) 145 activity (Lin et al. 2013).
The neuroprotective mechanisms of hyperforin might also be
related to inhibit COX-1 and 5-lipoxygenase in an earlier
study (Albert et al. 2002). Hyperforin was considered to be a
direct 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (IC50=90 nM) as assayed with
purified human protein. Hyperforin inhibited 5-lipoxygenase
formation with IC50 at 1–2 μM in freshly isolated human
polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with Ca2+ ionophore
A23187. Hyperforin was also revealed to suppress
COX-1 formation in platelets as well as in cell-free system
(Albert et al. 2002).
Phenolic compounds represent a large group of herbal
medicines that possess neuroprotection. Those studies bring
better understanding about the antioxidant and antiinflammation
properties of poly-phenolic compounds.
Phenolic compounds have anti-oxidative capability due to
their ability to trap singlet oxygen. But anti-oxidative effect
is obviously not the only cause for neuroprotection. Antiinflammation
mechanism may through direct protein targets
which are poorly reported except for the inhibitory role of
hyperforin to 5-lipoxygenase. Moreover, many of them have
similar structures, for example apigenin versus luteolin (difference
in one hydroxyl group) and calycosin versus
formononetin (difference in one methyl group) (Figure 3).

The question is why these similar compounds have different
bioactivities in related to anti-inflammation. How about the
relationship between the structure and neuroprotective functions
? Another problem is that whether all of the polyphenolic
compounds have neuroprotective and antiinflammatory
effects? These questions deserve further intensive
investigations.
Saponins
Saponins are considered as one of the major antiinflammatory
compounds in many medicinal herbs used for
multiple infectious and autoimmune diseases. Herein we summarize
the saponins with the bioactivities of neuroprotective
effects and anti-inflammation property (Fig. 5).
The best-studied saponins are the ginsenosides fromPanax
ginseng including ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, Rg3, Rd and etc.
For instance, post-ischemic intravenous infusion of
ginsenoside Rb1 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
rats with permanent ischemia caused a 50 % reduction of the
infarction volume in comparison to vehicle control (Zhang
et al. 2005). In addition to protect brain tissues in ischemia
model, ginsenoside Rb1 was also reported to stimulate the
expression of GDNF from 3 to 120 h and peak at 48 h after
reperfusion (Yuan et al. 2007). Ginsenoside Rg3 treatment
reduced infarction volume and improved neurology score in
a rat model of cerebral I/R (Tian et al.2005;Shinetal.2013).
Mechanistically, ginsenoside Rg3 inhibited Ca2+ and H

induced swelling of mitochondria isolated from rat brains, the
generation of ROS in isolated mitochondria, improved mitochondrial
energy metabolism, inhibited MPT pore and enhanced
ATP levels (Tian et al. 2009). Ginsenoside Rd was
demonstrated to protect brain tissues and reduce iNOS and
COX-2 level in focal brain I/R injury (Liu et al.2009;Yeetal.
2011a, b). The neuroprotective role of ginsenoside Rd is
verified by both animal and human studies. In an aged rat
ischemic stroke model, animals administrated 10–50 mg/kg
Rd displayed significant reduction of infarct volume at cortical
and striatal area, and improved neurological function
which sustained for at least 2 weeks after the insult, even
when it was given at 4 h after reperfusion (Ye et al. 2011b).
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II
multicenter clinical trial examined the efficacy and safety of
ginsenoside Rd in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Based
on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores,
there was statistical significance between the group of 10 to
20 mg ginsenoside Rd infusion and placebo group (Liu et al.
2009). However, ginsenoside Rd did not improve neurological
functioning in that report, making it difficult to be developed
as clinical drug.
In addition to ginsenosides, ruscogenin, enriched in
Chinese herb Ophiopogon japonicas, has neuroprotective

( 8.0.0.2542.166895659 PDF Extractor SDK EVAL VERSION)
effects with anti-inflammatory properties. Pre-treatment of
ruscogenin markedly decreased the infarct size, improved
neurological deficits and reduced brain water content in a
focal brain I/R mouse model (Guan et al. 2013).
Furthermore, pre-treatment of ruscogenin (2.5 to 10 mg/kg)
dose-dependently inhibited NF-κB p65 expression and translocation
from cytosol to nucleus, and suppressed NF-κB target
genes including ICAM-1, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-1β
(Guan et al.2013). Similarly, astragaliside IV, one of the major
and active components of the Astragalus membranaceous,
improved neurological outcome and reduced infarct volume
at 24 h after reperfusion in rats when the compound (10 or
20 mg/kg) was administrated at the beginning of reperfusion
(Li et al.2012a). The neuroprotective mechanisms were associated
with the suppression of the expression of NF-κB-
derived inflammatory factors including MMP-9, ICAM-1,
TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as the prevention of neutrophils
infiltration in the brain parenchyma (Li et al. 2012a, 2013).
Saponins are a group of relative big molecules that have
detergent property. Generally, they could not easily pass
through BBB during normal state. However, the BBB disruption
during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion facilitates the
entry of saponins into parenchyma. In addition, similar to
phenolic compounds, the direct interacting targets are unclear,
and therefore, it is hard to explain the details of antiinflammatory
mechanisms.
Terpenoids
Terpenoids, derived from five-carbon isoprene units, are the
largest group of natural products. Multiple natural terpenoids
have strong anti-oxidative, anti-inflammation and neuroprotective
effect (structures are shown in Fig. 6). For example,
resveratrol, an enriched component in red wine, fruits and
vegetables, prevented neuronal cell death and decreased the
level of MMP-9 and NO in ischemic brain injury (Gao et al.
2006; Tsai et al. 2007; Li et al. 2012d). A ginger terpenoid
named 6-shogaol significantly decreased the LPS-induced
NO release and down-regulated the expression of iNOS,
PGE-2 IL-1β, COX-2 and TNF-α in BV-2 microglial cells
(Ha et al. 2012). Moreover, 6-shogaol suppressed the LPS-
mediated microglial activation and protected brain tissues in
an experimental transient global cerebral ischemia model
(Ha et al. 2012). Another example is tetrahydroxystilbene,
one of major compounds in Chinese herb Polygonum
multiflorum. Tetrahydroxystilbene treatment decreased infarction
lesion and prevented the loss of neurons in rat brains
after the rats were subjected to 90 min of ischemia followed
by 24 h of reperfusion (Wang et al. 2009). Meanwhile,
tetrahydroxystilbene inhibited NF-κB activation and iNOS
mRNA expression, intracellular ROS generation, and mitochondrial
membrane potential dissipation in primary
cultured cortical neurons exposed to OGD plus reoxygenation
to mimic ischemia-reperfusion in vitro (Wang et al.
2009).
Alkaloids
Alkaloids commonly exist in most of medicinal herbs and are
major components of bioactivities of medicinal herbs.
Figure 7 provides the information about representative alkaloids
with the bioactivities of neuroprotection and antiinflammation
, including huperzine A, sinomenine,
ligustrazine (also known as tetramethylpyrazin), and etc.
Huperzine A, a representative compound from Huperzia
serrata, was reported to restore regional cerebral blood flow,
reduced infarct size and neurological deficit score at 24 h after
2 h ischemia (Wang et al. 2008). Huperzine A inhibited
nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the expression of iNOS
and COX-2 at ipsilateral cortex and striatum (Wang et al.
2008). Leonurin from Leonotis leonurus significantly improved
neurological outcome and reduced I/R-induced cerebral
infarction. Leonurin reduced ROS level in mitochondria
and attenuated mitochondrial membrane swelling, restoration
of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP biosynthesis and
content of cytochrome c in mitochondria isolated from ischemic
cortex (Loh et al.2010;Qietal.2010). Sinomenine from
Sinomenium acutum decreased infarction size and improved
neurological functional recovery in rat model with 2 h of
ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion (Wu et al. 2011).
The neuroprotective mechanisms were also found to inhibit
TNF-α and PGE-2 in cultured rat midbrain neuron-glial cells
(Qian et al. 2007). Another alkaloid ligustrazine (20 mg/kg)
exhibited attenuated tissue injury induced by permanent occlusion
of brain artery (Kao et al.2013). Ligustrazine inhibited
the activation of macrophages/microglia and the infiltration of
lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. Ligustrazine also
up-regulated Nrf-2 dependent expression of HO-1 in ipsilateral
neurons and macrophages/microglia and reduced the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in those cells after
cerebral ischemia (Kao et al. 2013).
Another potential anti-inflammation mechanism of alkaloids
could be related to mimic the endogenous biological
molecules binding to proteins or nucleotides. For example,
huperzine A binds to acetylcholinesterase (Bai et al. 2013);
sinomenine binds to transferrin (Du et al. 2007); berberine
binds to hemoglobin (Hazra et al. 2013) and DNA (Li et al.
2012b). However, the link between the property of proteins or
DNA binding and the regulation of immune response is still
unclear. Further studies could open a new chapter for better
understanding the molecular targets of those compounds in
anti-inflammation and neuroprotection.
Taken together, current progress already opens a door to
explore the active compounds from commonly used TCM
herbs for stroke treatment and seek their molecular targets
330 J Neuroimmune Pharmacol (2014) 9:313–339
(8.0.0.2542,586051696 PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL)
for anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Those discoveries
are useful not only for elucidating the scientific basis of herbal
medicine for stroke treatment in TCM practice but providing a
cue for drug development. Many compounds have the potentials
to be developed as candidates for drug discovery.
Nevertheless, most of the studies only reported the phenomenon
about the modulations of some inflammation factors and
their potential linkages of neuroprotective effects on either
cultured cell models or various cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
animal models. Many studies only indicate the observed items
to have been changed by the treatment of those compounds.
Whether such changes are attributed to their direct actions or
indirect responses to the treatments remain unknown. Many
studies have not provided supportive evidence by using pharmacological
intervention or genetic tools to build the internal
relationship between the molecular targets and neurological
protective effects. Although cellular and animal experiments
have revealed their neuroprotective effects, none of them is
verified to be neuroprotective agent for stroke treatment in
human subjects. Even in cellular and animal experiments,
there are many unanswered questions remained. For instance,
what are their specific molecular targets? What are the longterm
impacts of daily-taking of those compounds for health
promotion and neuroprotective benefits? Answering these
questions will have great impacts on human health since many
of those compounds are already daily-taken by many people
for health promotion.
Summary and Perspectives
In the treatment of ischemic stroke, salvage of brain cells in
penumbra area of ischemic brain is especially important for
stroke treatment. Neuroinflammation is one of critical pathophysiological
processes in the neurological degeneration in
response to cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines are produced and accumulated up
to dozens folds, exacerbating neuronal damage and
neurovascular injury during stroke. Therefore, combating inflammation
is a promising strategy for treatment of ischemic
stroke associated with severe neuroinflammation. Natural
compounds provide a rich source to attenuate neuroinflammation
and prevent aggression of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
injury. Nevertheless, we must remark that different types of
inflammatory cells are activated and hundreds of inflammatory
mediators are released at different phases during ischemic
brain injury. In the process, the interactions between cytokines
, chemokines, adhension molecules and small molecules
make the inflammation mechanisms especially complicated.
How to dissect the role of each factor in neuroinflammation in
response to ischemia-reperfusion injury in the inflammatory
network is difficult. Correspondently, most studies on the
effects of anti-inflammation and neuroprotection of herbal
products are still superficial and incomplete, because it is not
easy to claim the accurate inflammatory factors or cells that
are targeted by natural compounds. More intensive investigations
are necessary to understand the complex pathological
process and develop new drugs for targeting the crucial signaling
pathways to save ischemic/hypoxic cells. Further extensive
studies on dissecting key inflammatory factors at
different stages during ischemic stroke offer good targets for
developing novel therapeutic approach to treat ischemic
stroke.
Last but not least, stroke becomes one of the major disease
burdens in public healthcare and is the second leading cause of
death and the first leading cause of disability in human diseases
worldwide. More urgently, although tremendous efforts
have been made to develop therapeutic approaches for improving
therapeutic outcome for post-stroke treatments, clinical
outcome is still not satisfied. For decades, over 1000
compounds have been tested in animal models of ischemic
stroke and 114 drug candidates approved for clinical trials, but
none of the 114 compounds that entered clinical trials have
been successful (2006). After so many years of failure with the
facts that translation of positive results obtained in the laboratory
into the clinic has been exceptionally elusive, scientists
raise the question whether researchers should continue to
pursue neuroprotective strategies for stroke (2006). The potential
reasons could be multiple, such as intervention time,
doses, age and associated illnesses, differences between the
brains of human and animals, and evaluation methods of
efficacy, etc. A crucial reason may be from the prevalent
“one drug, one target” dogma in previous strategies for drug
development in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
Progress in Systematic and Integrative Biology has
revealed that human cells and tissues are composed of complex
networking systems with redundant, convergent and
divergent signaling pathways. After stroke, the processes of
brain degeneration and brain repairs involve in multiple signaling
pathways. Thus, traditional-designed agents to target
individual factors have limited success in stroke. In
Traditional Chinese Medicine, therapeutic strategies are generally
made by using well organized herbal formulas which
are based on a unique TCM theory with the strategies of
multiple components and ingredients to act on multiple signal
pathways. Although the exact active compounds and molecular
targets are unclear, many herbal formulas have been
clinically used for the treatment of ischemic stroke for centuries
with huge amounts of case reports. Thus, Chinese herbal
medicine offers a great and unique source at the levels of both
single compounds and complex combined formulations for
drug screening. US and Chinese scientists have jointly
established a library of 202 authenticated medicinal plant
and fungal species and about 10,000 standard fractions from
these materials (Eisenberg et al. 2011). Recent progress in
mass analytic technologies for studying complex systems

provides novel plateforms for drug discovery from herbal
medicine. The compenhensive matrix analytic techologies,
such as LC-MS, DNA microarray, proteomics, metabolomics,
and etc., offers new opportunities to explore the active compounds
and their molecular targets, facilitating drug discovery
for stroke treatment. Therefore, studies on the therapeutic
strategies of Chinese hebral medicine not only provide novel
cue to find active compounds to prevent neuroinflammation
and protect neuronal cells from ischemic brain injury, but
introduce a new strategy for drug development targeting multiple
neuropathological pathways including neuroinflammation
in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
