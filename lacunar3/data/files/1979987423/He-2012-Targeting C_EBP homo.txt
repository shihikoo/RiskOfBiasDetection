Subarachnoid hemorrhage
Endothelial apoptosis plays a major role in the development of cerebral vascular spasm after subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH). C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) orchestrates apoptosis in a variety of cell types in response
to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, implicated in the brain injury after SAH. However, the role of
CHOP in the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after SAH remains unexplored. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the effect of CHOP silencing on endothelial apoptosis and CVS following subarachnoid hemorrhage
in the rat. The study was conducted on 65 rats and employed endovascular perforation model of SAH.
CHOP siRNAs were injected 24 h prior to the hemorrhage. At 72 h after SAH brains with basilar arteries (BA)
were collected from euthanized rats for laboratory investigations. Triple fluorescence stain revealed expression
of CHOP in cerebral vascular endothelia after SAH. Marked reduction of CHOP protein and the reduction
of its downstream signaling effectors, bim and caspase-3, were found in BA with Western blot analysis. CHOP
silencing reduced number of apoptotic endothelial cells in BA, and increased BA diameter after SAH. The amelioration
of CVS was associated with reduced neuronal injury in cerebral tissues. In conclusion, CHOP siRNA
treatment can effectively combat apoptotic mechanisms of cerebral vasospasm set in motion by subarachnoid
bleeding.

Introduction
Apoptosis plays a major role in the development of vasospasm after
SAH (Yan et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2005). Although it had been pointed
out that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a major role in
neurovascular apoptosis, its involvement in the mechanisms of cerebral
vasospasm after SAH has not been addressed experimentally (Yan et al.,
2008; Zhang et al., 2008). ER stress activates C/EBP homologous protein
(CHOP) (Ma et al., 2002), which leads to apoptosis through several mechanisms
including downregulation of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2
(bcl-2) protein (Matsumoto et al., 1996 ). CHOP dependent apoptosis
also requires induction of B cell lymphoma-2 interacting mediator of
cell death (bim) — one of the most powerful propapoptotic BH3-only
member of bcl-2 family (O'Connor et al., 1998). In a variety of cellular
stresses, CHOP acts through direct transcriptional induction of bim
(Heath-Engel et al., 2008; Oyadomari and Mori, 2004; Puthalakath et al.,
2007). Studies have shown that upon induction of ER stress bim translocates
to the ER and promotes activation of caspases (Hetz, 2007). The aim
of this study was to assess whether CHOP siRNA, after intracerebroventricular
administration (Behlke, 2006) can eliminate CHOP in vascular tissues
thus leading to a reduction of endothelial apoptosis and amelioration
of cerebral vasospasm after SAH. Regarding the mechanism of treatment
we hypothesized that bim, a major CHOP downstream target, is
downregulated in the basilar artery in response to CHOP silencing while
bcl-2 is overexpressed, which all in concert protect against endothelial
cell death.
Material and methods

A total of sixty five male Sprague Dawley rats weighing between
300 and 350 grams were randomly allocated to the following groups:
sham surgery (n=10), untreated controls with SAH (n=14, two rats

into the left lateral cerebral ventricle at 24 h prior to the induction of
SAH (siRNA−1 injected group (n=13, one rat died) and siRNA−2
injected group (n=13, one rat died)). SAH was induced by left sided
endovascular perforation of middle cerebral artery with 4–0 nylon 
monofilament. At 72 h after surgery all rats were sacrificed to evaluate
degree of vasospasm, examine cerebral basilar arteries for apoptosis
and expression of CHOP and its downstream targets, and to detect histological
injury in cerebral tissues. Basilar artery was collected because
it is close to bleeding site and is sensitive to subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH). Studies have shown that BA vasospasm forms an independent
factor of poor neurological outcome in patients with SAH (Sviri et al.,
2006). In addition BA is relatively easy to be obtained and the body of
BA is big enough for researching. Thus BA appears representative for cerebral
vascular spasm after SAH from the clinical standpoint and is very
suitable for laboratory investigation techniques.
Animal experiments complied with NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Loma Linda University
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Treatment with CHOP siRNA
RNAs (Dharmacon) were injected in the sterile PBS
intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at a rate of 0.5 microL/min at 24 h before
SAH. The following coordinates were used: 1.5 mm posterior,
1.0 mm lateral, and 3.2 mm below the horizontal plane of bregma. Irrelevant
scrambled RNA was injected as control. siRNA injection site
selection was based on the previous protocol with injection coordinates
and the data verifying its effectiveness in vascular silencing
(He et al., 2012; Suzuki et al., 2010). The intracerebroventricular
(ICV) injection was associated with effective CHOP elimination from
vascular tissues in the present study, as further demonstrated by
Western Blot results. Studies utilizing ICV injections of siRNA after
SAH have shown that siRNA can reach molecular targets in cerebral
vascular endothelial cells with this approach (Yan et al., 2011). Collectively
these data are indicative of high diffusion potential of siRNA administered
via ICV route. Either of the two different CHOP siRNAs was
administered. The first RNA sequence was: sense, 5′GGAAGAACUA
GGAAACGGA; antisense, 5′UCCGUUUCCUAGUUCUUCC. The second
siRNA sequence was: sense, 5′CUGGGAAACAGCGCAUGAA; antisense,
5′UUCAUGCGCUGUUUCCCAG (He et al., 2012).
Western blot analysis
Cerebral basilar arteries were recovered and homogenized in the
RIPA buffer as previously described (Fathali et al., 2010 ). Protein
extracts were resolved with the SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes, which were blocked and subsequently incubated
at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies including: CHOP (Millipore)
bcl-2, bim (both from Santa Cruz Inc.), and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
), each diluted 1:500. This step was followed by 2-h incubation
with respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz; dilution
1:1000), and then by developing chemiluminescence of protein
bands with ECL kit (Amersham). Chemiluminescence was recorded on
autoradiographyfilms and optical density of protein bands was quantified densitometrically with Image J software (NIH). Densitometry
results were normalized to beta-actin and sham group data.
Nissl staining
The rats were euthanized and transcardially perfused with 10% buffered
formalin, the brains recovered and postfixed by immersion in the
same fixative overnight. Then brain samples were cryoprotected with
30% sucrose in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cut into 10 μm
thick sections with a cryostat. Nissl staining was done by dipping
brain slices in 0.5% cresyl violet for 2 min followed by dehydration
and coverslipping with Permount. Nissl stain slides were observed
under the light microscope (Ostrowski et al.,2005 ).
Morphometric analysis
Brain sections encompassing basilar artery were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin according to the routine protocol (Suzuki et al.,2009).
Then histological photographs were serially captured with microscope
camera under thefinal magnification ×400. At the predetermined anatomical
locations the diameter and thickness of basilar artery were
measured using Image J software. Four measurements were used to calculate
one score per rat while six rats were used to arrive at the mean
values for morphometric parameters of the basilar artery.
Triple fluorescence staining
This combined staining was done as previously described (Fathali et
al., 2010). Briefly, histological slices 10 μm thick were subjected to antigen
retrieval by microwaving in the citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for 10 min.
After incubation with blocking serum brain slices were treated with the
primary anti-CHOP antibodies (Millipore) and anti Von Willebrand factor
(VWF; Santa Cruz Inc.) at the dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4 °C.
Then primary antibodies were washed out with PBS and the incubation
with secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs), conjugated
with AMCA (for CHOP) and Texas Red (for VWF) was carried out for 2 h
at the room temperature. Primary antibodies were omitted for the negative
immunostaining control. Then TUNEL withfluorescein was done
on the same sections with a kit as described (Matchett et al., 2007).
After coversliping with antifade reagent (Millipore), fluorescence in
the brain sections was assessed under Olympus BX51 microscope. Images
of histological preparations were captured in three composite
channels and merged by means of Magnafire software (Optronics).
TUNEL, DAB
Section were incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture as above,
washed in PBS and incubated with anti-fluorescein-POD-conjugates
for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min incubation
with peroxidase substrate and DAB chromogen. Afterfinal wash, sections
were dehydrated, cleared in xylenes and coverslipped under
Permount.
Cell count
Cell count was conducted on the eight photographs of each analyzed
anatomical region per animal, while six rats were included
from each group for cell counting analysis (He et al., 2012).
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are expressed as means±SEM. Statistical significance
was verified with ANOVA and Holm-Sidak post-hoc test. Probability
level less than 0.05 was determined as significant. Non-parametric
ANOVA with Dunn's test was conducted where appropriate.
Results
CHOP elimination modulates apoptotic protein expression
Western blot analysis showed that SAH increased CHOP level
more than 4-fold. Scrambled RNA injection did not prevent this
CHOP increase in the basilar artery (Fig. 1A). In either of the two
siRNA groups CHOP protein increase was over 2-fold, which was significantly less than in the SAH group. In parallel, 3-fold increase in
bim protein level of BA was noted in both SAH and scrambled RNA
group. This increase was reduced to less than 2-fold with siRNA

injections (Fig. 1B). The upregulation of bim expression after SAH was
followed by that of the cleaved caspase-3 in BA. However, caspase-3
level was greatly reduced with silencing treatment (Fig. 1D).
Bcl-2 protein was significantly reduced after untreated SAH or
treated with scrambled RNA (Fig. 1C) to about 20% of control level
(sham surgery). CHOP silencing brought partial normalization of
bcl-2 levels, to nearly 80% of control. In addition there were no significant
differences in bcl-2 levels between sham-operated control and
silencing groups, regardless siRNA1 or siRNA2.
CHOP immunoreactivity is colocalized with TUNEL in the basilar artery
endothelia
In the representative images of the triplefluorescence stain TUNEL
positivity indicated presence of apoptosis (Fig. 2A) that co-localized
with Von Willebrand factor fluorescence (Fig. 2B) and with that of
CHOP (Fig. 2C), as demonstrated by white color on merged composite
images (Fig. 2D).
CHOP siRNA treatment reduces vascular narrowing and apoptosis in the
basilar artery after SAH
Upper panels in the Fig. 3A contain H&E stain photographs from
low and high magnification which demonstrate reduced vascular diameter
of basilar artery and the thickening of its vascular wall after
SAH, when untreated or treated with scrambled RNA. Administration
of siRNAs greatly increased the diameter of BA after SAH. Higher
magnification reveals thickening of basilar arteries in SAH and scrambled
RNA group but not in the siRNA treated group. The third row of
panels in the Fig. 3A reveals marked abundance of TUNEL positive
cells in the endothelial layer of basilar artery in the SAH and scrambled
treatment groups which was however lessened in both siRNA
groups. Bar graphs demonstrate around 50% reduction in the diameter
of basilar artery after SAH (Fig. 3B). Scrambled RNA had no significant
effect on the diameter of this artery after SAH while siRNA1 or
siRNA2 largely restored BA diameter, to around 80% of its pre-SAH
length. The thickness of the artery increased about twofold after
SAH and even slightly above that in the scrambled RNA group. Significant
reduction of the thickness was noted in the siRNA1- and
siRNA2-treated rats (Fig. 3C). Quantitative cell count revealed no detectable
TUNEL positive cells in the basilar arteries of sham operated
rats (Fig. 3D) however the number of cells was around 20 per visual
field in the SAH group and in the scrambled RNA group. Significant reduction
of the apoptotic cell numbers by around 50% was brought by
the treatment with either siRNA1 or siRNA2, with even strength.
Reduced neuronal injury accompanies amelioration of CVS with CHOP
elimination
Representative photographs of Nissl stain show extensive damage
of neuronal cells in the CA1 of the hippocampus and in the subcortical
brain region on day 3 after SAH. In both structures cellular loss and
presence of numerous dark neurons can be found (Fig. 4A). With
siRNA treatment, however, only scarce dark neurons can be seen in
Fig. 1. Western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins in the vascular tissues of basilar artery. CHOP protein was effectively eliminated with siRNA (panel A). Suppressed bim protein
level accompanied CHOP decrease (panel B). Bcl-2 protein level showed increase in the group treated with CHOP siRNAs (panel C). Reduction of cleaved caspase-3 in BA of rats
treated with CHOP siRNAs (panel D). Panels A–D: n=6 in each group (&pb0.05 vs. sham; #pb0.05 vs. SAH, ANOVA).

the hippocampus (upper panels) and in the subcortex (lower panels).
In the hippocampus the number of damaged cells exceeded 40 per visual field (Fig. 4B) after SAH and SAH with scramble RNA injection.
Numbers of damaged cells were reduced to less than 20 in the two
siRNA groups, which produced a significant difference with respect
to SAH. In the subcortex cell count revealed nearly 40 damaged cells
per visual field on average (Fig. 4C). Scrambled RNA had no effect
on the number of damaged cells. In contrast CHOP siRNA injection
very effectively reduced number of damaged cells in the subcortex,
to less than 10 cells per visual field (Fig. 4C).
Discussion
In the present study we have demonstrated elevated levels of CHOP
in the basilar artery after SAH. CHOP silencing, however, by using two
different siRNA sequences, effectively eliminated SAH-induced CHOP
elevation in the vascular tissues. CHOP elimination was associated
with reduction of bim and cleaved caspase-3 while it raised bcl-2 levels
in basilar arteries of siRNA-treated rats. CHOP silencing resulted in the
increased diameter, reduced thickness and lessened number of apoptotic
cells in the vascular endothelia together with a reduction of neuronal
damage in the hippocampus and subcortex.
Novelty of this work is several-fold. It embarks on revealing the
role of CHOP and bim in mediating vascular endothelial apoptosis
leading to arterial narrowing after SAH. To our knowledge this is the
first study demonstrating such involvement. The significance of the
present work is further supported by demonstrating that CHOP elimination
targets mechanisms of CVS after SAH, which implicates viable
therapeutic opportunities. In addition, this study shows a suitability
of siRNA in targeting mediators of apoptosis in cerebral vasculature
after SAH. Owing to this approach the study pioneers the effective
use of siRNA against cerebral vasospasm following SAH. Only recently
siRNA has been used as a molecular intervention in SAH but only to
verify the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase
(MKP)-1 pathway in the anti-vasospastic effect of recombinant
osteopontin (Suzuki et al., 2010).
Although the involvement of bcl-2 depletion and activation of
caspase-3 in the mechanisms of apoptosis in the brain after SAH have
been pointed out by earlier authors, the role of CHOP and bim has
remained unexplored (Cheng et al.,2009;Yanetal .,2008 ). In the apoptotic
machinery CHOP induces bim and represses bcl-2 (McCullough
et al., 2001; Szegezdi et al.,2009 ). Consequently, in the brain vessels
with CHOP siRNA treatment bim was reduced while bcl-2 rebounded,
which resulted in the antiapoptotic effect. Bcl-2 can play antiapoptotic
role at the level of miotochondria and ER where it reduces Ca2+content
or, alternatively, it blocks Ca2+release upon cellular stress (Szegezdi et
al., 2009 ). Furthermore overexpression of bcl-2 reduces capacitative
calcium entry, the important mechanism of vasospasm alone
(Zuccarello et al.,1996). The increased bcl-2 has been shown to reduce
endothelial apoptosis and cerebral vasospasm in the rabbit model of
SAH treated with EPO (Chen et al., 2009). However in order to fully
demonstrate the role of CHOP elimination on the apoptosis in the hemorrhagic
brain, other antiapoptotic proteins need to be examined, such
as bcl-xl and bcl-w to which CHOP effector bim can bind as well
(O'Connor et al.,1998 ). In addition the effect of CHOP elimination on
bax and bak levels also warrants investigation (Gotoh et al., 2004). Nevertheless
bim is considered to be one the most potent inducers of apoptosis
amongst bcl-2 family, and has been linked to CHOP, hence
investigated in this study (O'Connor et al., 1998). In accordance with
the notion that apoptotic pathway underlying CVS ultimately relies on
effector caspases, we observed elevated cleaved caspase-3 in the basilar
arteries although it was reduced with CHOP siRNA treatment.
Through these mechanisms CHOP elimination could reduce apoptosis
in the endothelia of cerebral vessels. Others have reported
Fig. 4. Reduced neuronal injury accompanies reduced vasospasm with CHOP siRNA treatment. Representative photographs (panel A) and quantitative cell count in the hippocampus
(panel B) and in the subcortex (panel C) show reduced number of damaged neurons with the treatment (&pb0.05 vs. sham; #pb0.05 vs. SAH, ANOVA). (n=4 sham group; n=6 in
other groups).

that targeted CHOP gene disruption potently reduces apoptosis in
response to ER stress (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004). CHOP elimination
with RNA interference also has been used by earlier authors to reduce
cell death in a variety of cultured cells (Blaschke et al., 2004; Endo
et al., 2007). As for the present study, following the salvage of endothelial
cells from apoptotic death, the exposure to spasmodic substances
in blood might has been reduced and thereby vasospasm
could have been relieved in this mechanism. Indeed, we observed
increased diameter of basilar artery in the treatment group. Noticeably
, the thickening of arterial wall has been reduced significantly
with the treatment despite thick perivascular blood deposits
suggesting that the effect of CHOP siRNA did not depend on the favorable
blood distribution or augmented blood clearance from the subarachnoid
space in treatment group rats.
In addition this study strongly suggests that ER stress, as a main CHOP
inducer, plays a major role in the development of CVS. ER stress in cerebral
vessels after SAH may be initiated through several triggers including
ROS and inflammatory cytokines (Zhang and Kaufman, 2008), which
have been long known to be associated with development of CVS after
SAH (Sercombe et al.,2002). However, it has been known that detrimental
sequealae of CVS are enhanced by increased vulnerability of the brain
that depends on the severity of primary hemorrhage (Frykholm et al.,
2004). Especially because we administered CHOP prior to injury there is
a possibility that reduced CVS could be at least in part due to alleviation
of acute impact of SAH. On the other hand CHOP elimination specifically
from vascular compartment could primarily trigger the reduction of CVS
and consequently ameliorate neuronal injury. Thus, based on this study
it cannot be ruled out that overall beneficial outcome stems also from interactions
between early neuronal injury and CVS reductions with CHOP
siRNA.
Alongside with the histologically confirmed CVS, in the Nissl stained
preparations we have found damage in the subcortex and in the hippocampus
, which forms a pattern of injury fairly consistent with the presence
of cerebrovascular narrowing. It is known for the fact that cerebral
vascular spasm, when abnormally prolonged, results in cortical and subcortical
lesions and the hippocampal injury as well (Bendel et al.,2006 ).
Noticeably, these changes were reversed with alleviation of vasospasm
after CHOP siRNA administration.
Although siRNA based therapeuticsremain in the nascent state a few
instances in literatures point toward amelioration of behavioral deficits
induced with siRNA treatments in cerebrovascular diseases including
SAH (Li et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011). Studies of siRNA
for vasospasm after SAH are lacking, however. It has been proven by several
authors that amelioration of CVSresults in improved neurobehavior
(Jeon et al., 2009). However endovascular perforation model of SAH is
not very well suited to evaluate CVS-induced neurological deficit, due
to overlapping neurological worsening caused by early neuronal injury.
Thus the major strength of this present study stems from demonstrating
that siRNA can reduce histological vasospasm after SAH. However it will
be worth a while to test the effect of CHOP siRNA on arterial spasminduced
neurological deficit in an optimized animal model, such as rat
double hemorrhage that exhibited significant neurobehavioral deficits
even when minimal proximal large artery vasospasm was present
(Jeon et al., 2009; Takata et al., 2008). Notably, in the study of early
brain injury after SAH, also evaluating CHOP siRNA, we have found the
acute beneficial effect of silencing on neurobehavior (He et al., 2012).
Although presentfindings may offer a new promise for clinical management
of SAH, this study takes only one step toward translation.
Indeed, several hurdles to clinical applicability of siRNA are ahead. In
order to combat prolonged and insidious fashion of vasospasm formation
, a slow release formulation of silencer may be needed. Clinical efficacy
may suffer from difficulties in penetration of siRNA across biological
membranes and hemorrhagic compartments as well. It seems that in
order to overcome afore mentioned drawbacks of siRNA in the clinics,
advancing technology of nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA appears
desirable (Lobovkina et al., 2011).
Thus the present study supports the effectiveness of intracerebroventricular
route of siRNA administration for reaching targets in the cerebral
vasculature, which results in neuroprotection, and as such, it carries implications
for developing novel therapies of SAH.
This present study tested the mechanisms of siRNA that targets
particular mediator of endothelial damage leading to CVS after SAH.
However for future therapy development there is a need of further
experiments aimed at determination of CHOP expression profiles,
posttreatment efficacy, clinical safety and lasting effects of CHOP
elimination after SAH.
Conclusions
CHOP silencing reduces arterial narrowing after subarachnoid
hemorrhage which results in histological protection. The mechanisms
of vasospasm reduction involves a decrease in endothelial apoptosis
owing to elimination of CHOP and its proapoptotic targets while enhancing
the expression of bcl-2 in cerebrovascular tissues. The results
of our study substantiate the concept of combating vasospasm with
siRNA-based therapy.
