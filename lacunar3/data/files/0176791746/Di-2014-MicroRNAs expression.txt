Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18~25 nt) noncoding
single-stranded RNA molecules that act as negative
regulators of gene expression and modulating the stability
and/or the translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs.
Studies have shown that miRNAs control diverse aspects of
brain disease. Recently, several studies have suggested that
miRNAs alter the response to ischemia reperfusion injury and
regulate the expression of various key elements in cell survival
and apoptosis. This review article gives a brief overview of
some miRNAs (miR-15a/b, miR-21, miR-29b/c, miR-124,
miR-145, miR-181, miR-200 family, miR-338, miR-422a,
miR-497, and miR let 7 family) in cerebral ischemia
reperfusion injury. Although miRNAs could be potential
therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemia reperfusion
injury, their safety and other limitations need further
confirmation.

MicroRNAs
Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small noncoding
RNAs with mature transcripts of 18 to 25 nucleotides. Located
in introns or intergenic regions, a large primary microRNA
(pri-microRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Lee
et al. 2004; Ozsolak et al. 2008) and then processed to a 70–
100 nucleotides hairpin-shaped pre-microRNA by the ribonuclease
III Drosha complexed to the RNA-binding protein
DGCR8/Pasha (Lee et al. 2003; Han et al. 2004). The premiRNA
is then transported to the cytoplasm via exportin-5
and processed by the ribonuclease Dicer to generate an 18- to
25-nucleotide (nt) mature miRNA (Hutvágner et al. 2001),
which then binds to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of
complementary or partially complementary target messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) and thereby downregulates the target mRNA
via degradation or translational inhibition. Studies have shown
that miRNAs control diverse aspects of brain disease, including
neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders,
and tumor (Fagan and Perrin 2012; Lages et al. 2012; Wang
et al. 2012). Recently, several studies have suggested that
miRNAs could contribute to ischemia reperfusion injury by
altering key signaling elements.
Ischemia and reperfusion is a pathological condition characterized
by an initial restriction of blood supply to an organ
followed by the subsequent restoration of perfusion and concomitant
reoxygenation. In its classic performance, occlusion
of the arterial blood supply is caused by an embolus and
results in a severe imbalance of metabolism of supply and
demand, causing tissue hypoxia. Surprisingly, restoration of
blood flow and reoxygenation is frequently associated with an
exacerbation of tissue injury, namely ischemia reperfusion
injury (Yellon and Hausenloy 2007).
Stroke remains one of the top causes of mortality and
disability in the industrialized nations and many of the surviving
stroke patients suffer from severs disability for the rest of
their lives. There are different therapeutic approaches to cure
ischemic insult including intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis
(Higashida et al. 2003). Ischemia is followed by
hypoxia which causes damage to the tissue and vascular.
The following reperfusion is associated with an inflammatory
response which inhibits the re-established blood flow. Hence,
therapy of diseases related to acute ischemia should not only

sequelae of reperfusion (Weiss et al. 2012). Thus, it is of
great interest to further understand the pathomechanism
involved.
Changes in miRNA Expression
In response to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), miRNAs
are dysregulated in cultured neurons and astrocytes in vitro.
However, the expression profiles of the two cell types differ
significantly. In neurons, miR-21 and miR-29b are upregulated
, whereas miR-30b, miR-107, and miR-137 remain unaffected.
While in astrocytes, miR-21 and miR-29b are upregulated
as in neurons, but miR-30b, miR-107, and miR-137 are
also upregulated. MiR-210, the expression levels of which
show high variations in neurons, is significantly upregulated
in astrocytes (Ziu et al. 2011). Moreover, Liu and his colleagues
(Liu et al. 2013b) found that miR-206 expression
increased significantly at 4 h during OGD.

cells and normal PC12 cell. They found that expression of 68
miRNAs and 46 miRNAs were detected in both control group,
and the H

2-
treated groups, a total of 39 miRNAs were similar to
those of the control group and six were significantly
downregulated, involving miR-61, -160, -122a, -422a,
-494, and -513.
In vivo, ischemia reperfusion also affects the expression of
miRNAs. Jeyaseelan and colleagues (Jeyaseelan et al. 2008)
studied miRNA expression in rats that subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 or 48 h of
reperfusion. They identified the expression of 114 miRNAs in
ischemic brain samples. Among them, 106 and 82 transcripts
were detected in the 24- and 48-h reperfusion brain samples,
respectively. The 24-h brain samples showed 32 unique transcripts
, whereas the 48-h brain samples had only eight unique
detectable miRNAs. They found that levels of miR-7, -9, -27a,
-29 (b and c), -30e, -92, -98, -101a, -125a, -137, -148b, -204,
-218, -301, -338, -335, -369-5p, -376 (b and b*), and -424
decreased, whereas levels of miR-290 and -292-5p increased
at both reperfusion times (24 and 48 h). However, miR-138,
-210, -215, -324-3p, -422b, -451, -497, and -134 were upregulated
only at the 24-h time point, whereas let-7a, -7b, -7c, -7e,
miR-150, and -145 at the 48-h time point. With the same
ischemia reperfusion model, Dharap and colleagues (Dharap
et al. 2009) found that 24 miRNAs showed increased expression
and 23 miRNAs showed decreased expression at one or
more reperfusion time points (3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h) compared
with sham group. Among them, eight miRNAs showed a
significant change (miR-140, -145, and -331 increased and
miR-376b-5p, -152, -29c, -98, and -204 decreased) at all time
points. Whereas, 12 miRNAs showed altered expression
(miR-290, -214, -324-5p, -324-3p, and -344-3p increased
and miR-26b, -29b, -338, -30e, -341, -377, and -664 decreased
) at four of five time points evaluated. The miRNA
expression altered rapidly after focal ischemia. Eleven
miRNAs altered by 3 h of reperfusion (three increased
and eight decreased), and this number gradually increased
as the reperfusion time progresses. A maximal
number of 46 miRNA altered at 3 days of reperfusion
(24 increased and 22 decreased). In rats, Liu and colleagues
(Liu et al. 2010) found that miR-10a, -182,
200b, and -298 were upregulated, while miR-155, -
362-3p, 223, and -210 downregulated after 24 h of
reperfusion. Yuan and colleagues (Yuan et al. 2010)
used microarray analysis to characterize the miRNA
expression profile in rat hippocampus and to identify
changes in expression after 20 min of global ischemia
followed by either 30 min or 24 h of reperfusion. They
found that after ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion
, 23 microRNAs were upregulated and 32 were
downregulated, while after 24 h of reperfusion, 40 were
upregulated and 31 were downregulated. Focusing initially
on MCAO vs. sham-regulated miRNAs,
Hunsberger and colleagues (Hunsberger et al. 2012)
found that there were 101 differentially regulated
miRNAs (human, mouse, and rat miRNAs considered)
and 58 were upregulated and 43 were downregulated.
Meanwhile, Shi and colleagues (Shi et al. 2013) found
that three microRNAs were upregulated by more than 2-
fold and nine microRNAs were downregulated to less
than half the level of sham-operated controls following
MCAO. The emerging data indicated that a total of 346
miRNAs showed differential expression during cerebral
ischemia in rat models subjected to MCAO (Liu et al.
2013b). Among them, 27 miRNAs (miR-1, -10a-5p,
-10b, -133a/b, -18a, -196a/b/c, -20b-3p, -224, -26b,
-296, -297, -301b, -324-3p, -343, -380, -421, -448,
-449a, -484, -501, -532-3p, -543, -671, and -96)
displayed decreasing expression from 0 to 168 h whereas
25 miRNAs (miR-142-3p, -142-5p, -146a, -15b, -17,
-181d, -196a, -199a-3p, -19a/b, -20a, -21, -223, -25,
-27a/b, -298, -338, -339-5p, -363, -374, -382, -423,
-425, -743a, and -760-5p) displayed increasing expression
through all time points. Besides, miR-206, -21,
-290, -291a-5p, -300-5p, -30c-1, -503, -542-5p, -874,
and -877 increased in expression from 0 to 24 h and
gradually decreased from 48 to 168 h.
In mice undergoing ischemia preconditioning (IPC) for
15 min, Lee and colleagues (Lee et al. 2010) found that

miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, -429, -182, -183, and -96 were
upregulated at the 3-h group, while no miRNAs were downregulated.
They also detected two upregulated (miR-681 and
miR-197) and one downregulated (miR-468) miRNAs that
were selectively changed in the 24-h group compared with the
normal group. Table 1 summarizes the changes in miRNAs
reported in various models of cerebral ischemia or ischemia
reperfusion injury.
miRNA-15a/b
miR-15a has undergone extensive investigation to biologically
validate a physiological effect following acute ischemic
stroke (Yin et al. 2010a). It has recently been shown to
contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic vascular injury
through direct inhibition of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2. Gain
or loss of miR-15a significantly increased or induced OGD-
induced cerebral vascular endothelia cell death, respectively.
Interestingly, miR-15a itself was found to be transcriptionally
regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ
(PPARδ). Consistent with the in vitro findings,
intracerebrovascular infusion of a specific PPARδ agonist
significantly reduced ischemia-induced miR-15a expression,
increased bcl-2 protein levels, and attenuated caspase-3 activity
, decreased blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and reduced
cerebral infarction in mice after transient focal cerebral
ischemia. What is more, it has been reported that miR-15b
could target the 3′-UTR of Bcl-2 to suppress protein expression
, and molecular inhibition of miR-15b has a neuroprotection
against OGD (Shi et al. 2013).
miRNA-21
miR-21 has been shown to be a strong anti-apoptosis factor. In
Buller and colleagues’ study (Buller et al. 2010), they found
that stroke increased mature miR-21 levels by 3-fold in neuron
isolated from ischemic boundary zone compared to homologous
contralateral neurons 2 and 7 days after stroke. In vitro,
overexpression of miR-21 in cultured cortical neurons substantially
suppressed OGD-induced apoptotic cell death,
whereas attenuation of endogenous miR-21 by antisense inhibition
exacerbated cell death after OGD. Moreover, overexpression
of miR-21 protected against ischemic neuronal death
and that downregulation of Fas ligand (Faslg), a tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) family member and an important cell
death-inducing ligand, targeted by miR-21 likely mediated the

neuroprotective effect. However, in rats undergoing 10 min
four-vessel occlusion, Deng and colleagues (Deng et al.2013)
found that cerebral ischemia significantly upregulated miR-21
in the hippocampus. Silencing of miR-21 reduced protein
level of its downstream target matrix metallinoprotease-
9(MMP9), which played a key role in the pathogenesis of
post-ischemic blood brain barrier disruption and the formation
of lesions after ischemia (Liu et al. 2011).
miRNA-29b/c
Jeyaseelan and colleagues (Jeyaseelan et al.2008) and Dharap
and colleagues (Dharap et al.2009) found that miR-29b were
downregulated after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. However,
Zui and colleagues (Ziu et al. 2011) found that in neurons
exposed to OGD, expression of miR-29b was upregulated 2-
fold after 24 h when compared to expression in neurons under
normoxic conditions. Furthermore, Shi and colleagues (Shi
et al. 2012) found that miR-29b levels were significantly
increased in rat brain after transient MCAO and neurons after
OGD. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-29b promoted
neuronal cell death, whereas its repression decreased cell
death. MiR-29b is able to target multiple members of Bcl-2
family, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1 (Mott et al.2007), Bcl2L2 (Bclw
), and Bmf. Meanwhile, they verified that miR-29b directly
targeted and inhibited Bcl2L2 gene expression and then increased
neuronal cell death. Importantly, Bcl2L2 overexpression
rescued neuronal cell death induced by miR-29b. In
conclusion, miR-29b promoted neuronal cell death, at least
in part, repressing Bcl2L2. Opposite results were observed for
miR-29c, which targets DNA methyltransferase 3a
(DNMT3a) (Pandi et al. 2013). Gain or loss of miR-29c
significantly reduced or increased OGD-induced PC12 cell
death, respectively, and in vivo administration of miR-29c
decreased infarction after MCAO.
miRNA-124
MiR-124 is unique among miRNAs, since it is almost selectively
expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). As
such, the abundance of miR-124 within the CNS is more than
100 times higher than in other organs (Mishima et al. 2007).
No studies had reported that the expression of miR-124 had
significant changes in cerebral ischemia or ischemia reperfusion
injury (Jeyaseelan et al. 2008;Dharapetal.2009;Liu
et al. 2010;Yuanetal.2010) until Sun and colleagues (Sun
et al. 2013) found that the level of miR-124 was significantly
increased in ischemic penumbra as compared with that in
nonischemic area of MCAO mice. Consistently, OGD treatment
obviously increased miR-124 level in primary neurons.
In vivo, miR-124 overexpression significantly decreased,
while miR-124 knockdown significantly increased, the infarct
area of MCAO mice. In vitro, gain or loss miR-124 function
resulted in reduced or increased neuron apoptosis and death
induced by OGD, and increased or reduced anti-apoptosis
protein (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), respectively. Additionally, Liu
and colleagues (Liu et al. 2013a) found that miR-124
decreased brain levels of inhibitory member of the
apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 family (iASPP), which
competed with apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53
family(ASPP) and inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis
(Bergamaschi et al. 2003), whereas inhibition of miR-124
enhanced iASPP levels and significantly reduced infarction
in mouse focal cerebral ischemia. Meanwhile, Zhu and colleagues
(Zhu et al.2013) validated that miR-124 as a regulator
of the DNA repair protein Ku70 and treatment with miR-124
antagomir effectively enhanced Ku70 levels in the ischemic
region in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of cerebral miR-124
could reduce cell death and infarct size and improve neurological
outcomes. Conversely, Doeppner and colleagues
(Doeppner et al. 2013) found that viral vector-mediated miR-
124 delivery increased the resistance of cultured OGD cortical
neurons in vitro and reduced brain injury as well as functional
impairment in mice submitted to MCAO. Although these
studies had an opposite result and mechanism remains unclear,
miR-124 is still a potential novel and attractive target for
treatment of cerebral ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury.
miRNA-145
miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA that has been recently
implicated in the regulation of apoptosis networks in tumor
cells (Chen et al. 2010; Ostenfeld et al. 2010) as well as
cardiomyocytes (Lin et al. 2009;Lietal.2012). Moreover,
Dharap and colleagues (Dharap et al. 2009) found that miR-
145 had a significant increase after transient cerebral ischemia
in rat. Antagomir-mediated prevention of miR-145 expression
led to an increased protein expression of its downstream target
superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) in the brain. As SOD-2 is
known to play a role in the antioxidant defense, its induction
might promote cell survival after ischemia. Besides, Witwer
and colleagues (Witwer et al. 2010) found that miR-145
directly regulated interferon-beta (IFN-β) in the central nervous
system (CNS). In a preclinical model of focal cerebral
ischemia, systemic IFN-β delivery attenuated the development
of brain infarction and reduced lesion volume on
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by 70 % at
1 day after stroke (Veldhuis et al. 2003).
miRNA-181
The broadly conserved miRNA family miR-181 is one of
many miRNAs which change in the brain in response to
ischemia when studied using miRNA profiling techniques
(Jeyaseelan et al. 2008; Dharap et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 
2010). Levels of all miR-181 family members changed,
J Mol Neurosci (2014) 53:242–250 245
(PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
increasing in the core, where cells died, but decreasing in the
penumbra, where cells survived in mice undergoing 1 h
MCAO followed 0, 1, 3, 5, and 24 h reperfusion (Ouyang
et al. 2012). Although almost all members of the family
changed in a similar direction in response to ischemia and
had identical seed sequences, since miR-181a was the most
abundant and it was likely to have the largest effect. MiR-181
was also a possible regulator of several heat-shock protein 70
(HSP70) family members which had been extensively studied
for their multiple roles in cellular protection. Increased levels
of miR-181a were associated with decreased glucoseregulated
protein 78 (GRP78) protein levels, a member of
HSP70 family, but increased levels of mRNA, indicating
translational arrest. Increased miR-181a using plasmid overexpression
exacerbated injury both in vitro and in mice model
of MCAO. Conversely, reduced levels with antagomir or
inhibitor were associated with reduced injury and increased
GRP78 protein levels. In C6 cells, if GRP78 levels were
maintained, miR-181a no longer exerted a toxic effect
(Ouyang et al. 2012). Thus, reducing or blocking miR-181a
protected the brain from stroke. What is more, using OGD-
activated microglial cells, Zhang and colleagues (Zhang et al.
2012) found that OGD downregulated miR-181c expression
but upregulated TNF-α expression. The overproduction of
TNF-α that followed OGD-induced microglial activation induced
neuronal apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of miR-
181c partially protected neurons from cell death caused by
OGD-activated microglial. Meanwhile, miR-181c could directly
target the 3′-UTR of TNF-α mRNA, suppressing its
mRNA and protein expression. It suggested a potential role
for miR-181c in the ischemia/hypoxia injury.
miRNA-200 Family
In an IPC model, a total of eight miRNAs (miR-200a, -200b, -
200c, -141, -429, -182, -183, and -96) showed selective upregulation
in the IPC 3-h group (Lee et al.2010). The miRNA-
mRNA interaction needs complementarity between the
miRNA 5′ end seed sequence and the 3′-untranslated region
of the target mRNA. Based on the seed sequence similarity
and clustered genomic location, miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -
141, and -429 are categorized into a miRNA family: miR-200
family. Among the miR-200 family members, miR-200a,
miR-200b, and miR-429 are located in chromosome 4, while
miR-141 and miR-200c are in chromosome 6. Potential
mRNA binding targets of the miR-200 family include the
untranslated 3′ region of prolyl-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2).
PHD2 is known to hydroxylate hypoxia inducible factor 1α
(HIF-1α) marking it for proteasome degradation under
normoxic condition. HIF-1α, rapidly reduced by hypoxia, is
a well-established transcription factor that transcriptionally
regulates of both pro-survival and pro-death genes including
Bcl homology 3-only protein. The overall physiological effect
of HIF-1αactivation following stroke is believed to be toward
pro-survival; however, as neuron-specific inactivation of HIF-
1α has been demonstrated to increase brain injury following
stroke (Baranova et al. 2007). Indeed, miR-200 family overexpression
was shown to increase HIF-1α expression, suggesting
effective silencing of PHD2 target (Lee et al. 2010).
miRNA-338
Yuan and colleagues (Yuan et al.2010) found that expression
of miR-338 was upregulated more than 2-fold after 20 min of
global ischemia followed by 30 min in rat hippocampus.
However, in rats that subjected to MCAO followed by 24 or
48 h of reperfusion, expression of miR-338 was downregulated.
The expression of MiR-338 changes, indicating that it may
play an important role in the early ischemia reperfusion injury.
He and colleagues (He et al.2010) found that eiF4E3 was the
most likely potential targeting protein of miR-338, which
involved in neuronal protein synthesis and neuronal death
after ischemia reperfusion. Using dual-luciferase reported assay
, they validated that miR-338 could recognize the 3′-UTR
of eiF4E3 while it had no significant effect on the expression
of eiF4E3. The post-target-recognizing regulation for miRNA,
indeed, existed and this mechanism was possibly connected
with the tertiary structure of target mRNA. But the specific
mechanism needs further study.
miRNA-422a
Wang and colleagues (Wang and Li2007) detected the differential
expression of miRNAs between H
2
O
2
-induced PC12
cells and normal PC12 cells. It showed that 46 miRNAs were
detected in H
2
O
2-
treated groups, and six of whom were significantly
downregulated, involving miR-61, -160, -122a, -
422a, -494, and -513. Among them, only potential targeting
protein of miR-422a, namely Bcl-w, was related to apoptosis.
In H
2
O
2
-induced PC12 cells, the expression of miR-422a
decreased with increasing of H

concentration, while Bclw
increased. And it was also been testified that the gene sites
of Bcl-w had potential target for miR-422a, and regulating the
expression of miR-422a could adjust the expression of Bcl-w
protein (Li et al. 2009), which making miR-422a a potential
therapeutic target to treat ischemia reperfusion injury.
miRNA-497
miR-497 is another miRNA that has undergone extensive
investigation to biologically validate a physiological effect
following acute ischemic stroke (Yin et al. 2010b). It was
found to be induced in mouse brain transient MCAO. MiR-
497 was demonstrated to directly hybridize to the predicted 3′-
UTR target sites of bcl-2/-w genes and then inhibit translation.

in vivo, Yin and colleagues used an antagomir of miR-497 to
effectively lower miR-497 levels, reduce MCAO-induced
infarct, and improve neurological deficits with a corresponding
increase in bcl-2 protein.
miRNA Let 7 Family
Let 7 family RNA sequences and functions are both highly
conserved in invertebrates and vertebrates, and members have
been suggested to play essential roles in regulation of developmental
progression to the adult in terminal differentiation.
Yuan and colleagues (Yuan et al.2010) found that let-7a, -7b, -
7c, -7d, -7e, and -7f were downregulated after ischemia reperfusion.
However, Jeyaseelan and colleagues (Jeyaseelan et al.
2008) found that let-7a, -7b, -7c, and -7e were upregulated
after 48 h of reperfusion. Moreover anti-let 7f is neuroprotective
to mature female rats administered 4 h following a stroke
episode. Anti-let 7f reduced infarct volume in both cortex and
striatum, while anti-miR 1 reduced infarct volume only in the
cortex (Selvamani et al. 2012). Unlike females, anti-let 7f
treatment to age-matched male rats had no neuroprotective
effect. Sex differences in post-stroke outcome can be influenced
by the immediate presence of sex hormones or prenatal
hormone exposure or sex chromosomes, underscoring the
importance of the endocrine environment for miRNA actions.
Besides, let 7b was reported to directly regulated IFN-β
(Witwer et al. 2010) which can attenuate the development of
brain infarction and reduce lesion volume (Veldhuis et al.
2003).
miRNA-Based Therapies
As described above, miRNA levels are altered after cerebral
ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury and such changes
have profound effects on the downstream targets of these
molecules. Restoration or inhibition of miRNA activity, therefore
, represents a therapeutic opportunity to modulate cellular
process and improve outcomes in patients with cerebral ischemia
or ischemia reperfusion injury. The viability of miRNAs
as therapeutic targets is confirmed by the fact that a phase III
clinical trial adopting an anti-miRNA was successfully concluded
(santaris.com), indicating that miRNAs inhibitors
could become an important new class of drugs (Janssen
et al. 2013). However, the pleiotropy of miRNA action (one
miRNA affecting up to several hundred mRNAs) in conjunction
with the possible redundancy of miRNA action (one
mRNA regulated by several different miRNA) makes it hard
to predict the overall effect of interfering with the function of a
specific miRNA. Therefore, possible adverse effects of
miRNA-based therapies can be induced by miRNAs themselves.
For example, unintended downregulation of tumor
suppressor genes such as retinoblastoma (pRB) (Manning
and Dyson 2012) could compromise cellular homeostasis
and favor cancer development. Besides, miRNA mimics modified
double-stranded molecules with one strand containing
the same sequence as the mature miRNA contain uridine
bases and uridine-quanin nucleotide pairs that induce a nonspecific
immune response by activating Toll-like receptors
(Judge et al. 2005). As the miRNA mimic sequence cannot
be changed without its efficacy or specificity being compromised
, chemical modifications of these nucleotide-based are
necessary to minimize the immune reaction.
In addition to the above mentioned, there are still many
important limitations in the miRNA-based therapeutic with
the cerebral ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury, for example
, delivery issues, concern with maintenance of a pharmacodynamic
response and achievement of a therapeutic
index. But targeted delivery of these molecules, in particular
into the CNS remains the major obstacle. Direct administration
of miRNA therapeutics, for example into the ventricles
(Yin et al. 2010b; Ouyang et al. 2012 ), is one potential
delivery method, but the resulting tissue damage and
immune-system activation present some drawbacks. Delivery
methods that afford passage across the BBB have, therefore,
been explored. One such method involves exosomes which
are 30- to 100-nm lipid bilayer vesicles that are secreted by
cells and can serve as carriers for RNA molecules (Schorey
and Bhatnagar 2008). On their entry into the systemic circulation
, exosomes can cross the BBB and deliver miRNA
molecules for gene silencing (Alvarez-Erviti et al. 2011;
Katakowski et al. 2013). Another way to cross the BBB is
by the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. AAV has
different serotypes, which can allow for potential tissue specificity
, and recombinant AAV packaged in a serotype 9
(AAV9) capsid effectively passes through the BBB (Foust
et al.2009). Delivered in viral vectors, the miRNA of interest
can be continually expressed, resulting in robust replacement
expression of miRNAs downregulated during ischemia or
ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, AAV is currently
in use in a number of clinical trails for gene therapy, of which
the safety profiles have looked quite well. Another approach
involves the use of intranasal administrations and therapeutics
can rapidly gain access to the brain following intranasal administration
along the olfactory nerve pathway from the nasal
cavity directly to the brain, bypassing the BBB. This noninvasive
method of drug delivery has been proved effectively
with AM206, an miR-206-neutralizing antagomir (Lee et al.
2012).
In the field of ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury,
as previously mentioned, antagomirs or mimics to miR-
124, -145, -181, -497, and let-7f have been shown in
animal models of MCAO to reduce the size of infarcted
brain tissue. Following future successful and safe administration
in primates, these specific antagomirs or mimics
may become candidates for miRNA-based therapeutic intervention
in human.

Conclusion
Taken together, the results described above show complex and
highly variable changes in expression of various miRNAs
after ischemia or ischemia reperfusion. These changes should
be incorporated into the current understanding of the complex
dynamic transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes that
occur in numerous pro-survival and pro-apoptotic mediators
at various cell types in response to ischemia or ischemia
reperfusion injury. It is plausible that in response to transient
cerebral ischemia or short period of nonlethal ischemia reperfusion
insults alterations in miRNAs expression favoring survival
and then activated in cortex, striatum, and/or hippocampus.
However, with prolonged ischemia leading to irreversible
damage, the pro-survival signals are turned off and then proapoptotic
miRNAs change. Moreover, it is plausible that
different animal strains, sex, and age may affect miRNAs
response to ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore
, we cannot exclude that different anesthetic agents may
affect miRNA expression, as they have effects on pre/postconditioning
and infarct size (Head and Patel 2007;Yeetal.
2012). Ischemia reperfusion induces alterations in the expression
of several miRNAs, each has various potential targets.
Together with alterations in the transcription and posttranscriptional
modification of numerous key signaling pathways
, changes in miRNA expression should be seen as part of
a network response and do not stand alone, as depicted in most
experiment studies.
The above-mentioned data suggested that specific miRNAs
are important in controlling ischemia reperfusion injury. What
is more, a single microRNA can regulate many target genes
and influence a whole gene network. Meanwhile, miRNAs
can be efficiently inhibited or excited both in vitro and in vivo.
An analysis of recent miRNA microarray studies indicates that
pathways such as apoptosis and inflammation are among the
most commonly affected pathways in ischemia or ischemia
reperfusion injury (Bhalala et al. 2013). Therefore, miRNA-
based therapies could be widely used in ischemia or ischemia
reperfusion injury by modifying these pathways. Though
multifaceted therapies that target many components in multiple
pathways are also likely to be required, side effects
brought by the miRNAs are bound to increase. Thus, exploitation
of miRNA-based therapeutics needs further clinical
research to accomplish this goal. Moreover, although cerebral
ischemic pre-conditioning protects against stroke, it is clinically
feasible only when the occurrence of stroke is predictable.
However, specific miRNAs can be used post-stroke.
With the growing evidence for the involvement and the regulatory
function of miRNAs in the ischemia reperfusion pathophysiological
processes, these small regulatory RNAs are
evolving as promising therapeutic targets. Emerging findings
from studies investigating the role of miRNA in ischemia
reperfusion injury have important limitations that do not
yet allow the drawing of firm conclusions. Consequently, a
clear narrative on the role and importance of specific miRNAs
in ischemia or ischemia reperfusion injury has not yet fully
evolved. However, it is anticipated that in the next few years,
significant discoveries that may have important therapeutic
implications will emerge.
Conflict of interest We declare that we do not have any commercial or
associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with
