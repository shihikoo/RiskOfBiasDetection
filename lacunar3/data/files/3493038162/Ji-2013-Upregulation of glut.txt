Excessive extracellular glutamate leads to neuronal death in central nervous system. Excitatory glutamate transporter subtype
2 (GLT-1) carries bulk of glutamate reuptake in cerebral ischemia. Although GLT-1 expression fluctuates during the period of
ischemia, little is known about its regulatory mechanism. Here we show an up-regulation of GLT-1 via mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR)-Akt-nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) signaling cascade in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that brief
rapamycin treatment significantly increased GLT-1 expression in cultured astrocytes. Rapamycin increased phosphorylation of
raptor at Ser792 and decreased phosphorylation of rictor at Thr1135, suggesting that both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and
mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are involved in GLT-1 expression. This conclusion was further confirmed by raptor and rictor disruption
experiments. Akt was activated by mTORC1 inhibition and required for GLT-1 expression because triciribine, a specific
inhibitor of Akt, blocked the increase of GLT-1 expression. mTOR-Akt cascade then activated NF-jB and increased jB-
motif-binding phosphoprotein (KBBP) expression and GLT-1 transcription. We next demonstrated that mTOR-Akt-NF-jB cascade
was activated in OGD and subsequently caused the upregulation of GLT-1. Supporting evidence included: (1) inhibition
of Akt or NF-jB occluded OGD-induced GLT-1 upregulation; (2) Raptor knock-down plus OGD did not add to the increase of
GLT-1 expression; (3) Intact mTORC2 was required for GLT-1 enhancement. In summary, our data first showed that mTORAkt-NF-jB cascade played critical roles to up-regulate GLT-1 in OGD. This signaling cascade may work to promote glutamate
uptake in brain ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction
In central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes play vital roles
in controlling extracellular glutamate clearance in excitatory
synaptic transmission and neurotoxicity (Halassa et al., 2007;
Huang and Bergles, 2004). Of five subtypes of glutamate
transporters in CNS (Kanai, 1997; Seal and Amara, 1999),
type 2 glutamate transporter (GLT-1) is the predominant subtype
that carries the bulk of glutamate reuptake and prevents
excitotoxic neuronal death (Kawahara et al., 2002, 2005;
Regan et al., 2007; Robinson, 1998; Rothstein et al., 1994;
Tanaka et al., 1997). Reduced expression of GLT-1 contributes
to several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, Alzheimer disease, and
Huntington disease (Li et al., 1997; Mathern et al., 1999;
Rothstein et al., 1995; Shin et al., 2005; Tanaka et al., 1997).
Besides, GLT-1 knock-down results in neuronal damage in
ischemia and seizure (Rao et al., 2001b; Tanaka et al., 1997).
Previous work has revealed several modulatory mechanisms
of GLT-1 expression. In cultured astrocytes, constantly
activated Akt induces GLT-1 expression through increased
transcription (Li et al., 2006). Lee et al. (2012) reported that
estrogen receptor modulators, 17b-estradiol and tamoxifen,

increase GLT-1 expression via transforming growth factor
alpha (TGF-a) signaling in astrocytes. In CNS, astrocytic
GLT-1 is up-regulated by neuronal stimulation, which may
be mediated through neuronal secreted factors (Munir et al.,
2000; Nakagawa et al., 2008; Schlag et al., 1998; Swanson
et al., 1997; Zhou and Sutherland, 2004). Recent evidence
shows that the neuron-stimulated GLT-1 expression requires
nuclear factor-jB (NF- jB) (Ghosh et al., 2011) and NF-jB-
motif-binding phosphoprotein (KBBP) (Ji et al., 2011; Yang
et al., 2009), which is further demonstrated by Benediktsson
et al. (2012) that neuronal activity influences the organization
of GLT-1 in the developing astrocytic membrane. Despite
these findings, the regulatory mechanism of GLT-1 in pathophysiological
conditions, such as ischemia, is poorly understood.
In fact, it has been found that GLT-1 expression
fluctuates during ischemia (Rao et al., 2001a; Romera et al.,
2007). GLT-1 is upregulated at the early phase of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) but downregulated after 24 h
or longer (Martin et al., 1997; Rao et al., 1998, 2001a; Torp
et al., 1995).
Classically, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is
the downstream target of Akt. Nevertheless, a reciprocal activation
of Akt mediated by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) has recently emerged as
an important signaling event in tumor syndrome, cancer, and
insulin resistance (O’Reilly et al., 2006; Sabatini, 2006; Sarbassov
et al., 2005, 2006; Sun et al., 2005; Tremblay et al.,
2005). However, function of this cascade in CNS has not
been studied. Interestingly, 50AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) inhibits mTORC1 through the phosphorylation of
mTORC1 partner protein raptor at Ser792 (Gwinn et al.,
2008; Kim et al., 2011). Because AMPK is activated in
energy loss condition (Hardie and Sakamoto, 2006), it
implies that mTOR-Akt cascade may play roles in ischemia.
In the present work, we aimed to explore whether mTORAkt
cascade is involved in the regulation of GLT-1 in oxygen
glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia.
As a result, we demonstrated that mTOR-Akt-nuclear factorjB (NF-jB) cascade existed in astrocytes and upregulated
GLT-1 expression in a short treatment of rapamycine or
OGD, which required dissociation of mTORC1 and activation
of mTORC2. Our work provided a new insight into the
function of mTOR-Akt cascade in CNS.

Animals and Astrocytic Culture
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation
Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University. Animals were maintained
at the Experimental Animal Center of Zhejiang University
and kept under temperature-controlled conditions on a 12:12 h
light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Cortical astrocytes
were derived from E18 Sprague-Dawley rats and prepared according
to our previous work (Ji et al., 2011). Cortices were dissected and
incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 20 min at 37C. Tissue
was triturated and suspended in 10% DMEM (GIBCO). Cells were
plated at a uniform density of 2 3 105 cells mL21. Oligodendrocytes
and microglial cells were removed by shaking at 200 rpm for 2
h at 37 C. In these cultures, 95% of cells are astrocytes based on
immunocytochemical criteria (Ji et al., 2011). Cells were cultured
for 11 days then treated with different conditions.

with 2% B-27 (Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-alanyl-glutamine. The culture
medium was renewed every 3–4 days. All cultures were maintained
at 37C in a humidified incubator gassed with 95% O
2
and
5% CO
2
. Neuron-conditioned medium (NCM) was collected from
neuronal cultures at DIV 9, cleared by centrifugation (38,000g for
30 min), and supplemented with one third volume of fresh astrocytic
medium (with 10% fetal calf serum).
OGD Assay
Astrocytes were washed and incubated in OGD medium (FBS and
glucose-free DMEM) in an anaerobic chamber (Forma, Marietta,
OH) containing a 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
mixture for 4 h at 37C
(Luo et al., 2005). Control cells were incubated in the same medium
containing glucose (5 mM) at 37C in a regular CO
2
(5%) incubator.
In some experiments, cells were incubated in control or OGD
medium supplemented with 100 nM rapamycin. Following incubation
under specific conditions, plates were immediately removed
from incubators and cells were harvested for immunoblotting.
siRNA and Transfection
Dominant negative constructs of IjBa (IjBa super-repressor-SR and
IjBa-DN) were gifts from Dr. Michael Robinson (Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).
IjBa-SR carries a mutation in both serine residues required for proteasomal
degradation of IjBa. I jBa-DN lacks the first 36 amino
acids of IjBa. Both constructs selectively block NF-jB signaling
(Brockman et al., 1995; Ghosh et al., 2011). Sequences of both constructs
were verified before use. IjBa-SR, IjBa-DN, and empty vector
(negative control) were transduced into astrocytes by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed in OPTI
(GIBCO) for 5 min at room temperature (15–25C), incubated for
20 min with plasmids diluted in OPTI. The mixture of plasmids
and lipofectamine was then incubated with astrocytes for 4–6 h at
37C in a cell culture incubator. Afterwards, cells were maintained
in 10% DMEM for 48 h before rapamycin and OGD treatments.
The transfection efficiency was around 60% by using this method
(Supp. Info. Fig. S1A).
mTOR, raptor, or rictor-targeting siRNA was transduced into
cultured astrocytes before plating by using Nucleofector II (Amaxa).
Each construct (100 pmol) was added to 200 lL astrocyte suspension
in electroporation buffer. Cells were electroporated with siRNA
and harvested for Western blot 2 days later. siRNA sequences of
mTOR, raptor and rictor were designed according to Rattus mTOR
gene (NCBI accession No: NM_019906.1), raptor gene (NCBI
accession No: NM_001134499.1), and rictor gene (NCBI accession
No: XM_226812), respectively. The sequences of mTOR siRNA
were: sense, 50-GCA CUA UGU CAC CAU GGA ATT-30; antisense
, 50-UUC CAU GGU GAC AUA GUG CTG-30. The sequences
of raptor siRNA were: sense, 50-GAA UCA UGA GGU CUG
AUA ATT-30; antisense, 50-UUA UAC GAC CUC AUG AUU
CTT-30. The sequences of rictor siRNA were: sense, 50-GCA AGG
CUG UGA UAU UCU ATT-30; antisense, 50-UAG AAU AUC
ACA GCC UUG CTT-30. The transfection efficiency was around
80% by using this method (Supp. Info. Fig. S1B).
RNA Preparation and Real-Time PCR
Levels of mRNA were assessed by real-time PCR using an ABIPrism
7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using oligo (dT) as the
primer and proceeded to real-time PCR with gene-specific primers in the
presence of SYBR Premix Ex Taq (DRR041A,TaKaRa Biotechnology,
China). Quantification was performed by the comparative cycle threshold
(Ct) method, using the b-actin as the internal control. The following
forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were used to amplify GLT-1 and
b-actin: GLT-1-F: 5’-GTT CAA GGA CGG GAT GAA TGT CTT A-
3’; GLT-1-R: 5’-CAT CAG CTT GGC CTG CTC AC-3’; actin-F: 50-
TCA CCC ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ATG A-30; actin-R: 5 0-CAT
CGG AAC CGC TCA TTG CCG ATA G-30.
Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
Cells were lysed in 500 ll ice-cold RIPA buffer (pH 7.4). The antimTOR
antibody was incubated with protein A-sepharose (GE
Health) at 1–2 lg of antibody/40 lL sepharose beads for 2 h in
RIPA buffer. The beads were washed with RIPA buffer and stored at
4C. The precleared protein lysate was incubated with anti-mTOR
antibody pre-coupled to protein A-sepharose beads. The proteins on
the beads were extracted with 80 lL 2 3 SDS sample buffer. All
samples were boiled for 5 min before Western blot assays.
Surface Biotinylation
Cell cultures were rinsed twice with PBS containing 1 mM MgCl
2
and 0.5 mM CaCl
2
(pH 7.4), then incubated with 1 mg mL21 sulfo-
NHS-LC-biotin (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 30 min at 4C.
Cells were quenched with PBS containing 100 lM glycine for 15 min
at 4C. For avidin pull-down, cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis
buffer and lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4C. After the concentration
of protein was measured by BCA protein assay, the supernatant
was incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo Scientific) for
2 h at 4 C and washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer. Biotinylated
proteins were extracted using 23 SDS sample buffer supplemented
with 50 mM DTT for 30 min at 50C prior to Western blot.
Western Blot
Astrocyte cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer containing proteinase
inhibitor cocktails (Merck Chemicals) and harvested. Protein concentrations
were measured in each sample using BCA protein assay.
Equal quantities of proteins were loaded and run on sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF
membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA), immunoblotted
with the antibodies and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The film signals were
digitally scanned, and the signals on the digital images were quantitated
using Image-J 1.42q (NIH, Bethesda, MD), as reported previously
(Ji et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012). GAPDH immunoreactivity
was set as the loading control in each experiment. All data were normalized
to the corresponding control.
Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in cultured astrocytes
at room temperature according to previous work (Shen et al.,
Ji et al.: Enhanced GLT-1 by mTOR-Akt-NF-jB Cascade

1999; Zhu et al., 2012). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate
glass with a perpendicular pipette puller (Narishige Instruments,
Tokyo, Japan). Pipette series resistance was 3–7 MX when filled
with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 Cs Methansulfonate
, 10 CsCl, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Na-ATP, and 0.4 Na-
GTP (310 Osm; pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). Cells were
voltage-clamped at 280 mV using a multiclamp 700A amplifier
(Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA). The analog signals were
sampled at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz using pClamp 9.0
(Molecular Devices). To measure transporter currents, a rapid solution
changer (RSC-160, Biological Science Instruments, Claix,
France) was used to apply drug solutions to recorded cells. Solutions
were made with Ringer’s containing (in mM): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2
CaCl
2
, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (Osm 310; pH 7.4 adjusted with
NaOH). The solutions in tubes were fed into the perfusion bath by
gravity at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min21.
Statistics
Statistical differences were determined by Student’s t test for twogroup
comparison or one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s post
hoc test for multiple comparisons. The accepted level of significance
was P< 0.05. Data in the texts and figures are presented as
mean6 SEM.
Results
Brief Rapamycin Treatment Increases GLT-1 Expression
in Astrocytes
We used cultured astrocytes to determine the function of
mTOR signaling in the GLT-1 expression. Greater than 95%
of cells in cultures expressed the astrocytic marker GFAP
(Ji et al., 2011). GLT-1 expression is hardly detectable in
astrocytic cultures (Gegelashvili et al., 1997; Kondo et al.,
1995), but is dramatically up-regulated by the application of
NCM (Gegelashvili et al., 1997; Schlag et al., 1998; Swanson
et al., 1997). Therefore, NCM was added to astrocytic cultures
at day 11 for 3 days to induce GLT-1 expression, as
shown in Supporting Information Fig. S2A. In our hands,
GLT-1 migrated as either monomer or multimer during gel
electrophoresis, similar to previous work (Yang et al., 2009).
We started to examine the effects of mTOR inhibition
on GLT-1 expression in astrocytes. 100 nM rapamycin, an
mTOR inhibitor (Guertin and Sabatini, 2007), was added to
astrocytic cultures for 4 h at day 14 to suppress mTOR activity.
As shown in Fig. 1A, mTOR inhibition by short rapamycin
treatment substantially increased the total expression of
GLT-1, while another astrocyte-expressing type 1 glutamate
transporter (GLAST) was unchanged. The effect of rapamycin
on GLT-1 expression depended on the concentration and
duration of treatment (Supp. Info. Fig. S2). Increasing concentrations
of rapamycin resulted in a stepped increase of
GLT-1 expression. The effect of 100 nM rapamycin treatment
almost reached the maximal (Supp. Info. Fig. S2B). Hence,
100 nM was choosed for following experiments. We also
examined the effect of longer rapamycin exposure on GLT-1
expression. It was intriguing that 24 h treatment of rapamycin
led to a decreased expression of GLT-1 (Supp. Info. Fig.
S2C), similar to previous work (Wu et al., 2010). This result
suggested that mTOR may modulate GLT-1 expression
through various mechanisms. In the present work, we aimed
to study the function of mTOR signaling at the early phase
of ischemia. Therefore, 4 h treatment of rapamycin was used.
Biotinylation assay was next used to indicate that rapamycin
increased the surface expression of GLT-1, but not GLAST
(Fig. 1B). Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was also used to
measure GLT-1-mediated currents. To block ionotropic and
metabotropic glutamate receptors, cells were perfused with
Ringer’s solution supplemented with receptor blockers,
D-AP5 (100 lM), NBQX (40 lM), UBP-301 (70 lM),
CPCCOEt (80 lM), and MPEP (1 lM). Under this condition
, 100 lM glutamate induced glutamate transportermediated
currents (GLT-11GLAST) with a mean peak current
of 1556 25 pA (n5 30; Fig. 1C). Rapamycin treatment
significantly increased glutamate transporter currents with a
mean peak current of 2706 39 pA (n5 35; Fig. 1C). When
a selective antagonist of GLT-1, dihydrokainate (DHK, 200
lM), was applied in the same cell, the remainder currents
were similar between control and rapamycin groups (control:
746 15 pA, n5 30; rapamycin: 766 16 pA, n5 35; Fig.
1C1), indicating that GLAST currents are not changed but
GLT-1 currents are increased. Together, these results demonstrated
that a short-term inhibition of mTOR increases the
expression of GLT-1.
Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are Involved in GLT-1
Expression
mTOR directly interacts with adaptor proteins raptor and rictor
to form two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2 (Chiang and Abraham, 2007; Hara et al., 2002;
Laplante and Sabatini, 2009). The expression and function of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 in astrocytes have not been
reported yet. First, we found that both raptor and rictor were
present in astrocytes (Fig. 2A). It is reported that a brief rapamycin
treatment increases raptor phosphorylation at S792 in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Sarbassov et al., 2005,
2006). Likewise, we found that rapamycin treatment (4 h)
phosphorylated raptor and dephosphorylated rictor in astrocytes
(Fig. 2B). Using Co-IP, we found that mTORC1 was
disassembled while mTORC2 was unaffected during rapamycin
treatment (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, these results were different
from previous work that both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 are disassembled in a longer rapamycin treatment
(24 h) (Sarbassov et al., 2006; Tyler et al., 2009), but consistent
with results derived from brief rapamycin treatment (Sarbassov
et al., 2005, 2006).

We next examined the necessity of mTORC1 and
mTORC2 in GLT-1 expression. siRNA-mediated knockdown
of mTOR, raptor, or rictor was performed by nucleofection
of astrocytes with vectors containing specific siRNA.
As shown in Fig. 2D,E, individual siRNA silencing effectively
inhibited the expression of mTOR, raptor, or rictor. Single
knock-down of raptor, but neither rictor nor mTOR, markedly
increased GLT-1 expression (Fig. 2F). These results suggested
that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to increase GLT-
1 expression. Interestingly, we also found that raptor knockdown
increased pAkt but did not change the total expression
of Akt (Fig. 2G), indicating that mTORC1 inhibition activates
Akt in astrocytes. To further determine roles of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GLT-1 expression, we performed
simultaneous knock-down of raptor and rictor in astrocytes.
Distinct from raptor siRNA only, simultaneous knock-down
of rictor and raptor did not affect the levels of GLT-1 and
pAkt (Supp. Info. Fig. S3). This result suggested that
rapamycin-induced GLT-1 increase requires intact mTOR-
rictor complex.
Akt is Required for GLT-1 Increase
The result that raptor knock-down activated pAkt (Fig. 2D
and Supp. Info. Fig. S3) inspired us to investigate roles of
Akt in GLT-1 expression. We first repeated the experiment
that a short mTOR inhibition (4 h rapamycin) significantly
increased pAkt in astrocytes (Fig. 3A). Next, astrocytes were
pretreated with 10 mM triciribine (TCBN), a specific Akt
inhibitor, at day 12 for 48 h. Rapamycine was then added
into cultures and GLT-1 expression was examined. We found
that TCBN remarkably suppressed the effect of rapamycin on
the total and surface expression of GLT-1 (Fig. 3A,B,E). pS6
was also enormously inhibited after rapamycin and TCBN
treatment (Fig. 3D), consistent with known result that pS6 is
the effector of mTORC1 (Chiang and Abraham, 2007; Laplante
and Sabatini, 2009). Figure 3C shows that pAkt was
activated in rapamycin but inhibited in the pretreatment of
TCBN. These results suggested that the effect of rapamycin
on GLT-1 expression is mediated by Akt activation.
NF-jB is Required for GLT-1 Expression
We continued to examine the downstream signaling of Akt
activation in rapamycin-treated astrocytes. It is reported that
NF-jB is activated by Akt serine-threonine kinase (Ozes
et al., 1999). Moreover, KBBP and NF-jB are needed for
neuron-stimulated GLT-1 expression (Yang et al., 2009;
Ghosh et al., 2011). We therefore asked whether NF-jB and
KBBP participate in GLT-1 expression. Astrocytic cultures
were transduced with either control vector or dominant negative
constructs of NF-jB, IjBa-SR and IjBa-DN, which
selectively block NF-jB signaling (Brockman et al., 1995;
Ghosh et al., 2011). The transfection efficiency of IjBa-SR
and IjBa-DN was confirmed by the deficit of p65, the effector
of NF-jB (Fig. 4A; also see Ghosh et al., 2011). Rapamycin
treatment (4 h) significantly increased the
immunoreactivity of GLT-1 and KBBP (Fig. 4A). We also
found that the level of GLT-1 mRNA increased after rapamycin
treatment (Fig. 4B). When astrocytes were exposed to
IjBa-SR or IjBa-DN, a significant reduction in the abundance
of GLT-1 as well as KBBP was seen (Fig. 4A), suggesting
that NF-jB is required for rapamycin-induced GLT-1
enhancement.
mTOR-Akt Signaling is Involved in GLT-1 Upregulation
in OGD
GLT-1 expression is increased at the early phase of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for unknown reason
(Romera et al., 2007). We hypothesized that mTOR participates
in the ischemia-stimulated GLT-1 up-regulation, given
that AMPK is activated and mTORC1 is inhibited during
energetic stress (Hardie and Sakamoto, 2006). To test this
hypothesis, in vitro astrocytic OGD experiments were performed.
Control astrocytes were incubated in high glucosecontaining
DMEM while OGD astrocytes were incubated in
OGD medium and exposed to hypoxia (95% N
2
and 5%
CO
2
) at 37 C for a short duration (4 h). In one group, 100
nM rapamycin was added to OGD astrocytes for comparison.
In support of our hypothesis, pS6 was inhibited in rapamycin
, OGD, and OGD1rapamycin groups (control:

132%6 18%; OGD: 29%6 12%; rapamycin: 31%6 15%;
rapamycin1OGD: 13%6 5%; Fig. 5A,B), indicating that
OGD inhibits mTORC1. In addition, the immunoreactivity
of GLT-1 increased (control: 21%6 7%; OGD: 82%6 24%;
Fig. 5C). The treatment of Rapamycin1OGD did not add
to the increase of GLT-1 expression (rapamycin: 95%6 13%;
rapamycin1OGD: 105%6 13%; P> 0.05 compared OGD;
Fig. 5C). pAkt was also remarkably enhanced in OGD, rapamycin
, and OGD1rapamycin groups (OGD: 82%6 9%;
rapamycin: 88%6 14%; OGD1rapamycin: 110%6 13%;
Fig. 5D). However, no difference of pAkt was found among
three groups. Total expressions of Akt and S6 were not
affected (Fig. 5A). These results implied that OGD evokes an
mTORC1 and Akt-related GLT-1 upregulation.
Phosphorylations of Raptor and Rictor are Altered
in OGD
Because the phosphorylation level of raptor-S792 and rictor-
T1135 is critical to the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2
respectively (Laplante and Sabatini, 2009), we next examined
the effect of OGD on the phosphorylation of raptor and rictor.
As shown in Fig. 6, the phosphorylation of raptor at S792 was
markedly enhanced after 4 h OGD compared to control.
Meanwhile, both S6 and rictor were dephosphorylated (Fig. 6).
Because the dephosphorylation of S6 implies that mTORC1 is
deactivated and the dephosphorylation of rictor-T1135 implies
that mTORC2 is activated (Julien et al., 2010; Sarbassov et al.,
2005; Werzowa et al., 2009), our results therefore suggested
that the activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are influenced
by the short-term OGD. This conclusion was further
strengthened by enhanced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6)
because activated mTORC2 phorsphorylates Akt (Laplante and
Sabatini, 2009). The total expression of raptor, S6, rictor, and
Akt did not change in OGD treatment (Fig. 6).
OGD Dissociates mTORC1 and Requires Intact
mTORC2 for GLT-1 Elevation
It is demonstrated in multiple cell lines that rapamycin
treatment reduces raptor-mTOR interaction (Laplante and
Sabatini, 2009). Differently, the action of rapamycin in
rictor-mTOR interaction is complicated. The rictor-mTOR
interaction is disrupted in some cell lines but unaffected in
others when treated with rapamycin (Laplante and Sabatini,
2009; Sarbassov et al., 2006). We thereby used Co-IP to
examine whether the assembly of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is
altered by 4 h OGD. As shown in Fig. 7A, raptor expression
precipitated by mTOR was significantly reduced by 78%,
while the interaction between rictor and mTOR remained
unaffected. Total expressions of raptor and rictor were not
changed (Fig. 7A). These results indicated that brief OGD
treatment displaces raptor from mTORC1 complex, but has
no effect on mTORC2 assembly.

To determine whether the intact mTORC1 or
mTORC2 is required for GLT-1 expression in OGD, raptor
or rictor was knocked down and OGD was performed
in cultured astrocytes. Similar to Fig. 5, OGD induced an
increase of GLT-1 expression (control: 33%6 6%; OGD:
76%6 9%), with accompanying pS6 reduction and pAkt
increase (Fig. 7B). Raptor knock-down plus OGD did not
further increase GLT-1 expression compared to OGD alone
(82%6 10%; Fig. 7B). This result confirmed our Co-IP
result (Fig. 7A), suggesting that mTORC1 complex is disrupted
in OGD. Interestingly, rictor knock-down inhibited
the increase of GLT-1 and pAkt in OGD (Fig. 7B), suggesting
that intact mTORC2 is required for the increased 
Akt phosphorylation and GLT-1 expression in OGD.
Together, these data showed that OGD dissociates
mTORC1 and requires intact mTORC2 to increase the
GLT-1 expression.
Akt and NF-jB are Required for GLT-1 Upregulation
in OGD
To examine whether Akt and NF-jB are required for OGD-
induced GLT-1 expression, Akt or NF-jB was inhibited prior
to OGD by applying TCBN or IjBa-DN construct in cultured
astrocytes (Fig. 8A). The levels of GLT-1, pAkt, pS6,
and p65 were then measured in control and test groups. Similar
to Fig. 5A, OGD induced a significant increase of GLT-1
(Fig. 8B; control: 49%6 8%; OGD: 139%6 12%) and
pAkt (Fig. 8C; control: 34%6 6%; OGD: 91%6 9%) as
well as decrease of pS6 (Fig. 8D; control: 110%6 9%;
OGD: 28%6 6%). p65 level was also increased after OGD
(Fig. 8E; control: 39%6 7%; OGD: 72%6 7%). Treatment
with either 10 mM TCBN or IjBa-DN transfection was able
to robustly reverse OGD-induced GLT-1 elevation (Fig. 8B),
indicating that the upregulation of GLT-1 in OGD requires
the activation of Akt and NF-jB.

Discussion
Our present work demonstrated that the mTOR-Akt-NF-jB
cascade led to an increased expression of GLT-1 in astrocytic
OGD, as summarized in Fig. 9. Specifically, this signaling
cascade was initiated by increased phosphorylation of raptor
at S792 and deactivation of mTORC1, which in turn inhibited
pS6 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) (Chiang
and Abraham, 2007; Laplante and Sabatini, 2009). Recent
work showed that rictor is directly phosphorylated at T1135
by S6K1 (Dibble et al., 2009; Julien et al., 2010; Treins
et al., 2010) and dephosphorylation of rictor at T1135
increases the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (Julien et al.,
2010). In our experiments, raptor was phosphorylated at
S792 and rictor was dephosphorylated in OGD (Fig. 6), suggesting
that mTORC1 disruption causes the activation of
mTORC2, which in turn phosphorylated Akt. Subsequently,
Akt activated NF-jB and increased GLT-1 expression.
Astrocyte is the central component of the brain’s antioxidant
defense (Desagher et al., 1996; Dringen et al., 2000),
and is critical to the neuronal survival in ischemia (Candelario-Jalil
, 2009; Nicotera and Bano, 2003). Asctrocytic GLT-
1 upregulation contributes to ischemic tolerance (Bigdeli
et al., 2008; Romera et al., 2004, 2007). GLT-1 knock-down
exacerbates the neuronal death and neurological deficit in
MCAO (Rao et al., 2001b). One interesting phenomenon is
that GLT-1 is up-regulated at the early phase of MCAO but
downregulated at the late phase (Martin et al., 1997; Rao
et al., 1998, 2001a; Torp et al., 1995). It is assumed that the
FIGURE 6: mTORC1 and mTORC2 are involved in astrocytic OGD. Western blots were derived from control or OGD-treated astrocytes.
Lysates were probed by immunoblotting with antibodies against pRaptor, total raptor (raptor), pS6, total S6 (S6), pRictor, total rictor
(rictor), pAkt, total Akt (Akt), GLT-1, and GAPDH. Quantification of all protein levels was normalized to GAPDH and shown in bar

down-regulation of GLT-1 is due to its degradation. Protein
kinase C (PKC) causes the endocytosis and degradation of
GLT-1 in ubiquitin-dependent manner (Sheldon et al., 2008;
Susarla and Robinson, 2008; Mart ınez-Villarreal et al., 2012).
However, the mechanism underlying GLT-1 upregulation in
ischemia is not understood. Using OGD model, we here
demonstrated that the upregulation GLT-1 in early ischemia
may be mediated by mTOR-Akt-NF-jB cascade. This
FIGURE 7: OGD dissociates mTORC1 and intact mTORC2 is required for GLT-1 expression in OGD. (A) Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated
with anti-mTOR antibody in OGD-treated (1) or untreated (2) groups. The immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-raptor (raptor),

to GLT-1, pAkt, total Akt (Akt), pS6, total S6 (S6), total raptor (raptor), total rictor (rictor), and GAPDH. All protein levlels were normalized to
GAPDH and summarized in bar graphs. Raptor and rictor levels after siRNA knock-down are shown as the percentage of corresponding control.

finding may provide a potential clinical target to promote
neuronal tolerance in brain ischemia. One shortcoming of
present work is lack of in vivo evidence. Future study should
be conducted to investigate the GLT-1 expression in ischemia
using astrocyte-specific mTOR or Akt deficient mice.
Rapamycin promotes Akt phosphorylation in MEFs, C6
glioma cells and HEK cells (Bhaskar and Hay, 2007; Laplante
and Sabatini, 2009; Wullschleger et al., 2006), which is mediated
by the inactivation of S6K1 and dephosphorylation of rictor
at T1135 (Guertin et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2006; Julien
et al., 2010; Rosner and Hengstschl€ ager, 2008; Sarbassov et al.,
2006). Despite these findings, the function of mTOR-Akt cascade
has never been studied in CNS. Our work provides the
first evidence for the physiological significance of this cascade
by showing its-mediated GLT-1 upregulation in astrocytic
OGD. Similar to our results, Pastor et al. (2009) reported that
OGD induces S6K down-regulation in astrocytes and increases
cell susceptibility to ischemic damage, but underlying mechanism
is not given in their work.
Using the dominant-negative and constitutively active
Akt, Li et al. (2006) found that Akt is involved in the regulation
of GLT-1. We previously reported that insulin induces
Akt-dependent increase of GLT-1 expression (Ji et al.,
2011). Combined with the present work, it may be concluded
that Akt is a key regulator of GLT-1 expression. Akt
phosphorylates many transcriptional factors. Ozes et al.
(1999) reported that Akt serine-threonine kinase is involved
in the activation of NF-jB. The latter is shown to contribute
to neuron-dependent regulation of GLT-1 transcription
through the interaction with KBBP (Ghosh et al., 2011;
Yang et al., 2009). Similar to these findings, we found that
KBBP was upregulated in brief rapamycin treatment and
OGD, which was reversed by NF-jB siRNA (Figs. 4 and
8). Taken together, one may speculate that Akt-NF-jBKBBP
pathway controls the GLT-1 expression in neurotoxicity
and ischemia.
We showed that both brief rapamycin and OGD treatments
(4 h) promote GLT-1 expression. On the contrary, previous
work showed that a long-term treatment of rapamycin (1–7
days) decreases or does not change GLT-1 expression (Zelenaia
et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2010). The discrepancy may be explained
by the function of mTORC2. As shown in Figs. 2, 6, and 7, rictor
was dephosphorylated at T1135 in response to brief rapamycin
and OGD treatments, consistent with previous report that
FIGURE 8: Akt and NF-jB are required for GLT-1 expression in astrocytic OGD. (A) Representative bands immunoblotted with antibodies

T1135 phosphorylation negatively regulates mTORC2-directed
Akt phosphorylation (Julien et al., 2010). Our Co-IP experiments
showed no disassembly of mTOC2 after rapamycin and
OGD treatments (Figs. 2 and 7), suggesting that rictor dephosphorylation
at T1135 does not dissociate mTORC2. Moreover,
knocking down rictor or mTOR did not induce GLT-1 enhancement
(Fig. 2). Transfection with rictor siRNA prevented OGD-
induced GLT-1 increase (Fig. 7). These results indicated that the
phosphorylation status of rictor and intact rictor-mTOR complex
are essential for Akt activation in a short mTORC1 inhibition
, consistent with previous work (Guertin et al., 2006; Jacinto
et al., 2006; Pastor et al., 2009; Rosner and Hengstschl€ ager,
2008; Sarbassov et al., 2006; Wullschleger et al., 2005). Akt
could not be activated when mTOR or rictor is deficient
(Fig. 2). Distinct from short treatment, prolonged rapamycin
treatment (24 h) causes almost complete loss of mTORC2 as
well as no Akt phosphorylation (Sarbassov et al., 2006; Tyler
et al., 2009). Therefore, GLT-1 elevation only occurs in early
OGD and ischemia when the intact mTORC2 is present.
Ischemia, trauma and neurodegeneration induce reactive
astrocytes and gliosis over time (Bushong et al., 2002,
2004; Choi et al., 2010). Growth factors play important
roles in transforming quiescent astrocytes into reactive astrocytes
, and also induce GLT-1 expression to reduce neuronal
cell death following injury (Codeluppi et al., 2009; Faulkner
et al., 2004). Because the activation of the EGF/Akt pathway
increases GLT-1 expression (Ji et al., 2011; Wu et al.,
2010; Zelenaia et al., 2000), it will be interesting to examine
whether GLT-1 is further increased by co-application of
growth factors and rapamycin during CNS injury, because
our work implied that brief administration of rapamycin
near the injury site might increase GLT1 expression and be
potentially neuroprotective. In fact, administration of rapamycin
has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory processes
(Erlich et al., 2007) and prevent epilepsy (Zeng et al.,
2008). Our results may also explain a recent study where
rapamycin treatment restores GLT-1 expression in cultured
mutant Htt-552-expressing astrocytes, a Huntington’s disease
model, and reduces the accumulation of Htt-552 (Chen
et al., 2012).
