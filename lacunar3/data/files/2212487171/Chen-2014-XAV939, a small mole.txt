White matter tracts are composed of axons and myelinating
oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating
cells in the central nervous system that allow
formation of myelin and saltatory nerve conduction. Cerebral
white matter is highly vulnerable to ischemic injury in
adults and neonates. White matter injury in newborn
brains results in cerebral palsy and cognitive disability. In
this study, we found that XAV939, a small-molecular
inhibitor that stimulatedb-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin, protected against serum and glucose deprivation
(SGD)-induced cell death in oligodentrocyte cell line
OLN-93 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We
further showed that XAV939 reduced caspase-3 and
caspase-8 levels and increased the expression of phosphorylated
Akt in SGD-induced OLN-93 cells. Our data
demonstrate that XAV939 protects against neonatal
hypoxic/ischemic injury. In summary, our results demonstrate
that XAV939 confers neuroprotection against SGD-
induced injury in OLN-93 cells via its antiapoptotic activity
and the loss of oligodendrocytes and neurons in neonatal
hypoxic/ischemic injury. V C 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Cerebral white matter is highly susceptible to ischemic
injury (Pantoni et al., 1996), and ischemic injury
often leads to permanent brain damage. White matter
injury is due mainly to cell death of the oligodendroglialineage
cells via necrotic and apoptotic death, as was demonstrated
in brain tissue of rodents (Carloni et al., 2007)
and preterm infants (Volpe, 2009). In white matter injury
of infants, myelin regeneration is inhibited by impaired
differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into
myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (Fancy et al., 2012).
Hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) injury also results in apoptotic
oligodendrocyte cell death and hypomyelination. Hypomyelination
indicates loss of myelin basic protein and lack
of mature oligodendrocytes (Cai et al., 2006). In rat
brains, oligodendrocyte maturation is almost completed at
postnatal day 7 (P7) in the white matter (Dean et al.,
2011). After neonatal injury, significant loss of oligodendrocytes
and demyelination was reported for the corpus
callosum (Levison et al., 2001). In white matter injury,
oligodendrocytes play an important role in the axonal
remyelination.
XAV939, a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling (Huang et al., 2009), inhibits Wnt target gene
expression, decreasesb-catenin levels, and causes accumulation
of Axin 1 and Axin 2 (Sakata and Chen, 2011). Axin
2 was widely expressed in white matter lesions of human
newborns with neonatal H/I injury, and the level of Axin
2 was essential for newborn brain injury and remyelination
(Xu et al., 2007). XAV939 stabilized the level of Axin 2
and may provide neuroprotective effects on white matter
injury. OLN-93, a permanent oligodendrocytic cell line, is
derived from spontaneously transformed cells at a late stage
of differentiation in a primary rat brain glial culture
(Richter-Landsberg and Heinrich, 1996). These cells show
characteristics of oligodendrocytes. Therefore, OLN-93
cells are widely used to study white matter injury. Our
study examined whether XAV939 has protective effects on
serum and glucose deprivation (SGD)-induced cell death
and H/I injury in vitro and in vivo.

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine
serum, trypsin, and penicillin–streptomycin solution were
obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY).
OLN-93 Cell Lines
The permanent oligodendroglial cell line OLN-93 was
obtained from the Richter-Landsberg Laboratory (Richter-
Landsberg and Heinrich, 1996). Cells were maintained in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine and 2 mM L-glutamine/
penicillin/streptomycin and grown in tissue culture dishes or
plates. For SGD, the normal growth medium was replaced by
serum- and glucose-free DMEM for 24 hr. In control cultures,
the normal growth medium was used.
Cell Viability Assay
Cells viability was determined by the ability of viable cells
to metabolize MTS, as described previously (Xu et al., 2007).
In brief, OLN-93 cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 hr prior
to the experimental treatments. After the indicated treatments,
OLN-93 cells were cultured overnight and 10 ll MTS solution
was added to the cells. After 3 hr of incubation at 37C, absorbance
at 490 nm was subsequently measured. Untreated cells
were considered to be the control, and the growth medium
without cells in the presence of MTS solution was used as the
solution background. Cell viability was presented as a percentage
of untreated controls. XAV939 was dissolved in 0.1%
DMSO. Different concentrations of XAV939 were used to test
the protection in SGD-induced cell death. There were eight
samples in each group, and the experiment was repeated at least
three times.
Western Blot Analysis
OLN-93 cells were seeded onto six-well plates and
kept in a CO
2
incubator for 24 hr. Cells were treated with
serum- and glucose-free DMEM or normal growth medium
DMEM for 24 hr. Ten nanomolar XAV939 was used for 24
hr. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS), collected with a rubber policeman,
and then lysed. Lysates were left on ice for 30 min. Protein
concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid
assay. Proteins were electrophoresed in Tris-glycine sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%)
and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots
were incubated with primary antibody against at 4C overnight.
After they were washed, blots were incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution
for 1 hr, developed by the ECL chemiluminescence system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Chester, PA), and captured
on Kodak (Rochester, NY) autoradiographic film. Film was
then digitalized with a camera, and densitometric analysis of
the bands was performed in AlphaEase image analysis software.
Both primary antibodies and secondary antibodies
were diluted in PBS. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal
antiphospho-Akt (Ser473;1:1,000),rabbitpolyclonal
caspase-3 (1:1,000) and caspase-8 (1:1,000), and mouse
monoclonal anti-b-tubulin (1:5,000; Cell Signaling Technology
, Danvers, MA).
Neonatal H/I Rat Model
Allanimalexperimentalprocedureswereapprovedbythe
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Soochow University.
The P7 Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from
Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China). Briefly,
the right common carotid artery was ligated under anesthesia
with diethyl ether. Surgery time for each pup did not exceed 5
min. After recovery for 1 hr, the pups were placed in a hypoxia
chamber containing a humidified atmosphere of 8%O
2
/92%N
2
and kept in a dry oven at 37C. After 2.5 hr of hypoxia, the pups
were returned to their dam (Zhou et al., 2010). XAV939 was
administered (0.1 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) 1 hr before hypoxia.
The control rats were injected with 100 ll0.1%DMSO.
Detection of Infarct Volume
Forty-eight hours after H/I, brains were removed and
sliced into 1-mm sections. Slices were incubated for 30 min in
0.2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma) at 37C. The infarct volume was traced and analyzed in
Alpha Ease image analysis software (Xu et al., 2006).
Immunofluorescence Staining
To evaluate the neuroprotection of XAV939 in H/I
injury, we tested for the numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes
at 48 hr after H/I. Brain sections were stained with anti-
Olig21 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and
anti-NeuN (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 overnight.
After the incubation with secondary antibodies, images
were digitized by using a fluorescence microscope (Axio Scope.A1
; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Statistical Analysis
All values were expressed as mean6SEM. Statistical differences
among groups were tested by one-way ANOVA, followed
by Bonferroni tests for multiple comparisons. Two
group comparisons were conducted with Student’s t-test.
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
XAV939 Protects Against SGD-Induced Cell
Death in OLN-93
OLN-93 cells were subjected to SGD for 24 hr.
Most OLN-93 cells lost normal morphology of their neurites
compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). XAV was incubated
with OLN-93 cells together for 24 hr. XAV939
partially protected against these SGD-induced morphological
changes. To quantify the protective effects of XAV939,
cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. XAV939 did
not provide any protection below a concentration of
0.01 nM (Fig. 1). XAV reduced SGD-induced cell death
in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations between
0.1 nM and 10 nM. At a concentration of 10 nM,
XAV939 almost completely protected against SGD-
induced cell death (Fig. 1). However, at 100 nM, cell viability
began to decrease. As the concentration was increased
to 1 lM, cell viability remained the same. Thus, the safe
concentration range of XAV939 is still wide.

XAV939 Decreased Apoptotic Cells Induced
by SGD
Increasing evidence shows different kinds of cell
death, including necrosis, necroptosis, apoptosis, and
autophagy, in ischemic brain diseases (Meloni et al.,
2011); however, apoptosis and necrosis are still considered
to be the dominant causes of cell death after ischemic
brain injury. The SGD-induced cell death represents a
useful in vitro model for the study of ischemic brain diseases
(Mousavi et al., 2010). Therefore, we examined
whether XAV939 protects against SGD-induced cell death
by blocking the apoptotic neuronal death. Caspase-3 and
caspase-8 are regarded as markers of apoptosis. Therefore,
we determined the caspase-3 and caspase-8 levels by performing
Western blot analysis after a 24 hr of incubation
of SGD in OLN-93 cells. We found that SGD injury
caused a significant increase of caspase-3 and caspase-8

compared with the control group (Fig. 2A). XAV treatment
decreased the level of caspase-3 and caspase-8 (Fig.
2A). Further quantitative analysis showed that XAV939
treatment markedly decreased caspase-3 and caspase-8 levels
after SGD (P<0.05; Fig. 2B,C), suggesting the antiapoptotic
activity of XAV939 after SGD injury.
XAV939 Increased Phosphorylated Akt Level After
SGD Injury
Because our data demonstrated that XAV939 prevents
neuronal apoptosis after SGD injury, we explored
the signaling pathways that are involved in the neuroprotection
of XAV939. We examined the PI3K/Akt pathway
, a survival pathway after ischemic brain injury. Our
results indicated that XAV939 treatment did not obviously
affect the phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) level in the
control group. However, in the XAV939 treatment
group, the level of p-Akt was markedly increased compared
with the SGD group (Fig. 3A). Quantitative analysis
confirmed the difference between the SGD group and
the SGD1XAV939 group (P<0.05; Fig. 3B), suggesting
that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the neuroprotection
of XAV939 in SGD injury.
PI3K Inhibitor LY-294002 Reversed the Protection
of XAV939 on SGD Injury
To investigate further whether the PI3K/Akt pathway
mediates the neuroprotection of XAV939 in SGD
injury, we treated the OLN-93 cells with a PI3K inhibitor
, LY-294002 (10 nM LY-294002 dissolved in 1%
DMSO). Cell viability assay showed that the PI3K inhibitor
LY-294002 canceled the protective effect of XAV939
treatment (P<0.05; Fig. 4A). At the same time, Western
blot analysis showed that LY-294002 inhibited the
increase of p-Akt level by XAV939 treatment (Fig. 4B).
XAV939 Pretreatment Reduced Infarct Volume
After H/I Injury
To examine further the protective effect of
XAV939 on cerebral ischemic injury, we performed

TTC staining 48 hr after neonatal H/I injury. XAV939
(0.1 mg/kg body weight) pretreatment resulted in a significant
reduction in infarct volume compared with the
H/I group (P<0.05; Fig. 5B).
XAV939 Reduced the Loss of Oligodendrocytes
and Neurons After H/I Injury
Because XAV939 pretreatment reduced infarct volume
after H/I injury, we examined whether the numbers
of oligodendrocytes and neurons were increased by
XAV939 treatment. Then, we tested for the numbers of
oligodendrocytes and neurons at 48 hr after H/I. In this
study, the numbers of oligodendrocytes and neurons were
increased (Figs. 6A, 7A). In comparison with the H/
I1DMSO group, XAV939 pretreatment in H/I injury
increased the numbers of Olig21 cells and NeuN1 cells
(P<0.05; Figs. 6B, 7B). Thus, with the reduction of
infarct volume and increasing numbers of oligodendrocytes
and neurons by XAV939 treatment, we concluded
that XAV939 exerted a protective effect in H/I injury.
DISCUSSION
Recently, white matter injury has attracted more attention
in ischemic brain injury research, compared with traditional
research, in the regeneration of neurons (Iwai
et al., 2010). Many central nervous system disorders, such
as ischemic injury and multiple sclerosis, involve white
matter injury. In H/I-induced white matter brain injury,
few oligodendrocytes can survive and mature to repair
the injured white matter (Xiong et al., 2013). This study
used OLN-93 cells to examine the SGD-induced cell
death of oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that
XAV939 protected against SGD-induced cell death (Fig.
1) and had powerful antiapoptotic activities (Fig. 2). Our
findings also showed that the PI3K/Akt signal pathway is
involved in the protective mechanisms of XAV939 for
SGD-induced injury (Figs. 3, 4). In addition, XAV939
had protective effects on H/I injury in a neonatal H/I
model by decreasing infarct volume (Fig. 5).
XAV939 is a small molecular inhibitor of the Wnt/
b-catenin pathway that stimulates b-catenin degradation
by stabilizing axin (Huang et al., 2009). XAV939 stabilizes
axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating
enzymes tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) and tankyrase 2 (TNKS2),
because XAV939 is able to bind tightly to the catalytic
domains of TNKS1 and TNKS2. Therefore, TNKS1 and
TNKS2 are the effective cellular targets of XAV939
(Sakata and Chen, 2011). It is known that XAV939 can

inhibit tankyrase activity, and recent research showed that
tankyrase activation induces apoptosis (Dalaklioglu et al.,
2012). Apoptosis depends on activation of caspases that
cleave a number of substrates, including tankyrase (Ai
et al., 2011). From a functional point of view, two types
of caspases were divided, upstream caspases and downstream
caspases. Caspase-8, which belongs to the upstream
caspases, can activate the downstream caspases such as
caspase-3,26, and27. Thus, the levels of caspase-8 and
23 reflect both upstream and downstream caspases. We
found XAV939 reduced the cleaving of casepase-3 and
caspase-8, which might act on tankyrase.
Because our data demonstrated the protective effects
of XAV939, we examined the effect of XAV939 on signal
pathways after ischemic injury. The PI3K/Akt pathway is
a critical survival mediator after cerebral ischemia and is a
therapeutic target for stroke (Mullonkal and Toledo-
Pereyra, 2007). It is not clear whether XAV939 activates
the PI3K/Akt pathway after SGD-induced injury. In this
study, we provide evidence that the PI3K/Akt activation
mediates the protection of XAV939 in SGD-induced cell
death and that the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway
abolishes the protection of XAV939 (Figs. 3, 4).
Although in our study the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002
almost completely blocked the protection of XAV939,
the PI3K/Akt signal pathway might not be the only protective
pathway. The inhibition of the Wnt signal of
XAV939 might also provide some neuroprotection, given
that previous studies have confirmed the properties of
XAV939 (Huang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Bao
et al., 2012).
H/I caused not only gray matter injury but also
white matter injury. However, white matter is of more
importance for functional recovery (Xiong et al., 2013).
Our research demonstrates that XAV939 can reduce
infarct volume after H/I injury and protect the injury via
increasing the numbers of oligodendrocytes and neurons,
which may provide a new drug for the treatment of white
matter injury in clinical. As a result of their size and electrical
charge, most drugs have limited access to the brain
for central nervous system diseases. There is no significant
amount of evidence to demonstrate that XAV939 can
cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Our data show that
administration of XAV939 (i.p.) in rats reduces the infarct
volume, suggesting that XAV939 probably can cross the
BBB in the presence of a disrupted BBB. XAV939, which
is a small molecular inhibitor, targets the enzymatic activity
of tankyrase and may cross the BBB directly. Alternatively
, it is possible that XAV939 can cross the BBB with
disruptions such as ischemic brain damage.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we show for the first time that XAV939
provides neuroprotection via its potent antiapoptotic
activity. XAV939 may represent a promising, easy-to-use
agent for the treatment of many white matter injury
diseases.
