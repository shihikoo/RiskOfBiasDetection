Abstract Inflammatory responses in the brain after cerebral
ischemia have been studied extensively in male mice, but not
female mice, thus potentially giving a less-than-accurate view
of gender associated pathological processes. In humans,
cerebral infarcts are typically smaller in premenopausal
females than in age-matched males. In the current study, we
confirmed smaller infarcts in female vs. male mice after middle
cerebral artery occlusion and 96 h of reperfusion. Moreover,
we explored immunological alterations related to this difference
and found that the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes
was significantly higher in spleens in males than females, with
increased expression of the activation markers, CD69 and
CD44. In contrast, the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes
was significantly higher in spleens of females than males,
leading to the identification of a small but distinct population
of IL-10-secreting CD8+CD122+ suppressor T cells that were
also increased in females. Finally, we observed that males have
a greater percentage of activated macrophages/microglia in the
brain than females, as well as increased expression of the
VLA-4 adhesion molecule in both brain and spleen. This
new information suggesting gender-dependent immunological
mechanisms in stroke implies that effective treatments for
human stroke may also be gender specific.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the
USA, yet relatively little is known about gender-associated
differences that might contribute to stroke outcome in females
vs. males. Previous studies have reported that, although premenopausal
females have smaller cerebral infarct volumes
than age-matched males after ischemic stroke [1, 2], female
stroke patients have a worse prognosis with time [3].
Although male sex is considered a stroke risk factor, the
lifetime risk of stroke is higher in women [4]. Clearly, stroke
risk and outcomes are not identical in both sexes. For example,
stroke incidence is higher in men vs. women across nations
and ethnic backgrounds [5]. This sexually dimorphic epidemiology
persists until well beyond menopause, suggesting
that estrogen does not fully account for the sex effect [6]. In
the infrequent experimental study that stratifies by sex, the
outcome and pathophysiology of brain ischemia are clearly
different [7–9]. A better understanding of such differences is
crucial for the development of effective therapies for stroke
patients of both genders.
The inflammatory response in the brain after cerebral ischemia
has been extensively studied in male mice, but not female
mice, thus potentially giving a less-than-accurate view of the
pathological picture of stroke when this research is translated to
human trials and applied to the treatment of both genders.

by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) manifest local
inflammatory processes that undeniably contribute to total
cerebral injury [10, 11]. There have been several reports on
sex differences in stroke related to pathophysiology and hormonal
effects, epidemiological work, treatments, and outcomes
[12, 13]. Although these differences are not fully understood,
recognition of gender differences in brain inflammation may
help to establish more appropriate treatments and improve
outcomes.
In this report, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution
of postischemic inflammatory cycling between the brain and
peripheral immune system is strongly influenced by biological
sex, including sexually dimorphic immune cell subsets
and key inflammatory mechanisms that affect brain–spleen–
brain cycling of inflammatory cells after focal cerebral
ischemia.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was conducted in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental
animals, and the protocols were approved by the Portland
Veteran Affairs Medical Center’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, protocol no. 2840-12, local database
ID no. 2840.
Experimental Animals
The Oregon Health and Science University Animal Care and
Use Committee approved all experiments. Male and female
C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor,
ME, USA) weighing 20–25 g were housed in a climatecontrolled
room on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Female mice were
not subjected to estrous cycle synchronization and were
allowed to cycle naturally. Food and water were provided ad
libitum. The experimental groups for this study were male and
female mice subjected to MCAO. The animal number for each
experiment is given in Tables 1 and 2 and is denoted in the
respective figures.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male and
female mice for 1 h by reversible right MCAO under
isoflurane anesthesia followed by 96 h of reperfusion as
described previously [14]. Head and body temperatures were
controlled at 37.0±1.0 °C throughout MCAO surgery
with warm water pads and a heating lamp. Occlusion and
reperfusion were verified in each animal by laser Doppler
flowmetry (LDF) (Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd.,
Oxford, England). The common carotid artery was exposed
and the external carotid artery was ligated and cauterized.
Unilateral MCAO was accomplished by inserting a 6-0 nylon
monofilament surgical suture (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ,
USA) with a heat-rounded and silicone-coated (Xantopren
Comfort Light, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) tip into the
internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery stump.
Adequacy of MCAO was confirmed by monitoring cortical
blood flow at the onset of the occlusion with an LDF probe
affixed to the skull. Animals were excluded if mean intraischemic
LDF was >30 % pre-ischemic baseline. At 1 h of
occlusion, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow
for reperfusion. Mice were then allowed to recover from
anesthesia and survived for 96 h following initiation of
reperfusion. In sham-treated mice, the filament is placed
but not advanced to achieve MCAO.
Neurological Deficit Score
Neurological function was evaluated at baseline (before
MCAO), just after reperfusion, and 24, 48, 72, and 96 h
after reperfusion using a 0- to 5-point neurological deficit
score as follows: 0, no neurological dysfunction; 1, failure
to extend left forelimb fully when lifted by tail; 2, circling
to the contralateral side; 3, falling to the left; 4, no
spontaneous movement or in a comatose state; 5, death
[14].
Infarct Volume Analysis
The brains were harvested after 96 h of reperfusion and
sliced into five 2-mm-thick coronal sections for staining
with 1.2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline as described
previously [14]. The 2-mm-thick brain sections
were incubated in 1.2 % TTC for 15 min at 37 °C, and 
then fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h. Infarction volume 
was measured using digital imaging and image analysis
software (Systat, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). To
control for edema, infarct volume (cortex, striatum, and
hemisphere) was determined by subtraction of the ipsilateral
noninfarcted regional volume from the contralateral
regional volume. This value was then divided by
the contralateral regional volume and multiplied by 100
to yield regional infarction volume as a percent of the
contralateral region.
Isolation of Leukocytes from the Spleen and Brain
Spleens from individual sham-treated and MCAO-treated
mice (eight mice in each group) were removed and a single
cell suspension was prepared by passing the tissue through a
100-μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA). The

cells were washed using RPMI 1640 and the red cells lysed
using 1× red cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) and incubated for 3 min. The cells were then
washed twice with RPMI 1640, counted, and resuspended in
stimulation medium (RPMI, containing 10 % FBS, 1 % sodium
pyruvate, 1 % L-glutamine, and 0.4 % βME). The brain
was divided into the ischemic (right) and nonischemic (left)
hemispheres and digested for 60 min with 1 mg/ml type IV
collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and DNase
I (50 mg/ml; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at
37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Samples were mixed with a 1-
ml pipette every 15 min. The suspension was washed once in
RPMI, resuspended in 80 % Percoll overlayed with 40 %
Percoll, and centrifuged for 30 min at 1,600 rpm. The cells
were then washed twice with RPMI 1640, counted, and
resuspended in stimulation medium.
Analysis of Cell Populations by Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS)
All antibodies were purchased (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA or eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) as
published. Four-color (FITC, PE, APC, and PerCP) fluorescence
flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine
the phenotypes of splenocytes and brain cells, as
previously published [15]. One million cells were washed
with staining medium (PBS containing 0.1 % NaN
3
and
1 % bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and incubated with the combinations of the
following monoclonal antibodies (mAb): CD4 (GK1.5), CD8
(53-6.7), CD11b (MAC-1), CD45 (Ly-5), CD11c (HL-3),
CD19 (1D3), CD69 (H1.2F3), CD44 (IM7), and CD49d (very
late antigen-4 [VLA-4]) for 20 min at 4 °C. One milliliter of
staining buffer was added to wash the cells. Propidium iodide
was added to identify dead cells.
Intracellular Staining
Intracellular IL-10 expression was visualized by modification of
a previously published immunofluorescence staining protocol
[16] which was reported by our laboratory [17]. According to
the protocol, isolated leukocytes were resuspended (2×106-
cells/ml) in stimulation media (RPMI 1640 media containing
10 % FCS, 1 mM pyruvate, 200 μg/ml penicillin, 200 U/ml
streptomycin, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 5×10−5 M2- βME with
LPS [10μg/ml], PMA [50 ng/ml], ionomycin [500 ng/ml], and
brefeldin A [10 μg/ml] [all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA]) for 4 h. For IL-10 detection, Fc receptors
were blocked with mouse Fc receptor-specific mAb (2.3G2; BD
PharMingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) before cell surface staining
and then fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm
Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Permeabilized cells were washed
with 1× permeabilization buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA) and stained with APC-conjugated anti-IL-10 mAb
(JES5-16E3; eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Isotypematched
mAb served as negative controls to demonstrate specificity
and to establish background IL-10 staining levels. Data

USA) and FCS Express (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA,
USA) software on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean±SEM. Differences in cortical
, striatal, and total (hemispheric) infarct volumes were
determined with Student’s t test. Functional outcomes for
neurological deficit scores were analyzed by Mann–Whitney
U test. Statistical significance was p<0.05. Statistical analyses
were performed using SigmaStat Statistical Software,
Version 3.1 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Spleen and
brain cell counts and percentages of cellular subtypes for
FACS analysis were analyzed by Student’s t test. The criterion
for statistical significance was p≤0.05.
Results
Males have Larger Infarct Volumes than Females
The evaluation of brain infarct after MCAO showed that
males had significantly larger infarct volumes compared to
females, as shown in Fig. 1a. Cortical infarct volume was
60.9±3.6 % in males compared to 35.7±5.5 % in females
(p=0.003). Similarly, striatal infarct volume was 81.1±6.4 vs.
43.0±10.4 %, respectively, in males vs. females (p=0.007),
whereas the volume in the hemisphere was 54.2±5.0 vs.
30.8±4.7 %, respectively (p=0.003). Quantitative assay of
TTC-stained cerebral sections after 96 h of reperfusion illustrated
the larger infarct area in males compared to females
(Fig.1b). There were no significant differences in neurological
deficit scores before the initiation of MCAO or during reperfusion
between males and females (data not shown).
Gender Differences in Total Splenocytes and Brain Cells
After MCAO
Our previous studies established that the spleens of male mice
undergoing MCAO became severely atrophied compared to
those after sham treatment and that there were increased
numbers of cells in the ischemic brain hemisphere after
MCAO. A similar pattern of splenic atrophy and increased
cell numbers in the brain was observed in the current study for
both genders, although the spleens of female mice were significantly
less atrophied than males after MCAO, consistent
with the smaller infarct size in females (Tables 1 and 2).
Gender Differences in T Cell Subtypes in Periphery
After MCAO
To identify immune cell phenotypes that might account for the
difference in infarct size in males vs. females, we evaluated
immunocyte subsets in spleen from males and females with
MCAO by flow cytometry. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 and
Fig. 2, the percentage of CD4+T cells was significantly higher
in spleens in males compared to females (20.7±2.7 vs.
15.8±2.8 %, p≤0.05; Fig. 2) Although the percentage of
CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in males, the opposite
was found for CD8+Tcells, with a higher percentage present in
spleens of female (20.1±1.9 vs. 16.3±2.7 %, p≤0.05; Fig. 2).
IL-10-Secreting CD8+CD122+ Suppressor T Cells
in the Ischemic Brain are Increased in Females After MCAO
The smaller infarcts coupled with increased levels of CD8+T
cells in spleens of females suggested a role for CD8+ suppressor
T cells. We thus quantified CD8+ T cells expressing
the CD122 marker, a small but distinct subpopulation known
for its ability to release IL-10. As shown in Fig.3a, there was
no significant difference in the percentage of CD8+CD122+
cells in females vs. males in the ischemic (right) brain

(Fig. 3a). However, there was a highly significant difference
in IL-10-secreting CD8+CD122+ suppressor T cells in females
(28.82±11.7 vs. 18.82±6.5 %, p≤0.05; Fig. 3b), thus
supporting the contention that smaller infarct volumes in
females could be due to enhanced IL-10 release by CD8+
suppressors.
Activated CD4+ Effector T Cells from the Spleen
are Increased in Males after MCAO
The larger infarcts in male mice suggested the possibility that
there might be an increased frequency of activated inflammatory
CD4+ effector T cells. Thus, we evaluated the expression
of CD69, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in
signaling and lymphocyte proliferation, and CD44, a marker
for effector memory T cells. As shown in Fig. 4, both CD69
(14.47±3.15 vs. 8.48±3.22 %) and CD44 (13.76±1.88 vs.
9.05±1.89 %) were significantly increased on CD4+ splenic
T cells from males vs. females after MCAO (p≤0.05).
VLA-4+ Cells from the Spleen and Brain are Increased
in Males After MCAO
VLA-4 is expressed in all leukocytes and binds to VCAM1
upon activation. The involvement of VLA-4 in transmigration
across the blood–brain barrier is well established and
likely contributes to infarct development by infiltrating inflammatory
cells. As shown in Fig. 5, we found that, after
60 min MCAO followed by 96 h reperfusion, cells from both
spleens (6.9±0.9 vs. 2.2±1.0 %) and brains (73.7±6.0 vs.
34.9±2.9 %) showed a significantly higher percentage of
VLA-4 (CD49d) expression in males vs. females (p≤0.01).
In contrast, there was no significant difference in VLA-4
expression on brain cells from sham-treated males vs. females
(24.5±9.8 vs. 21.1±4.6 %; Tables 1 and 2).
Activated CD45hiCD11b+ Microglial Cells/Macrophages
from the Ischemic Brain Hemisphere are Increased in Males
After MCAO
The pronounced increase in VLA-4+ cells in the ischemic
brain hemisphere of males and females represented a much
greater percentage of cells (∼35 % for females and >70 % for
males) than could be accounted for by the CD4+and CD8+T
cells (only 4–5 %). We thus evaluated activated microglia
and infiltrating macrophages, well known for their role in
localized inflammation contributing to increased infarct size,
that characteristically express the CD45hi and CD11b+
markers (Fig. 6a, b). We found that both the number
(∼60,800 for males vs. ∼22,200 for females, from Tables 1
and2) and the percentage (47.1±9.0 vs. 20.1±5.3 %; Fig.6c
and Table 2) of CD45hiCD11b+ cells were significantly
higher in the ischemic right brain in males vs. females

number (∼9,000 for both males and females) or frequency
(15.1±3.2 vs. 15.6±3.9 %; Table 2) of CD45hiCD11b+ cells
in the right brain hemisphere of sham-treated males vs.
females. These data implicate the infiltrating macrophages
and activated microglia as major contributors to the increased
infarct size in males compared to females at 96 h
post MCAO.

Discussion
Consistent with the literature, the current study verified that
infarct size was indeed significantly smaller in females than
males after 60 min MCAO and 96 h of reperfusion. In order
to explain this difference, we hypothesized that the larger
infarct size in males occurs due to increased numbers of
activated immunocytes migrating into the region of infarct
and producing further localized damage. We thus carried out
an evaluation of phenotypic markers on immunocytes from
the spleen and brain 4 days after MCAO. The results demonstrate
clearly that the larger infarct volumes in male mice
are associated with increased percentages of activated
CD69+ and CD44+ CD4+ T cells in the spleen, as well as
vastly increased numbers of activated macrophages, microglia
, and other as-yet unidentified cells expressing the homing
marker, VLA-4, that have transmigrated into the area of the
developing brain infarct. In contrast, the smaller infarct volumes
in female mice are reflected by fewer activated cells
but an increased percentage of CD8+ T cells in spleens,
including a small subset of IL-10-secreting CD122+ regulatory
CD8+ T cells in the ischemic brain that conceivably
could limit stroke severity in females.
The contribution of the spleen to brain injury after MCAO
has been well described [18,19]. In our previous studies [10],
we demonstrated that stroke induces massive early activation
of splenocytes, leading to the release of proinflammatory
cytokines at the 6- to 22-h time-points post MCAO, followed
by a drastic reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and severe
splenic atrophy by 96 h post occlusion. Several
proinflammatory pathways such as COX-2 and NOX-2 have
also been shown to be important in determining infarct size
after stroke [1], although these data were based on earlier
time-points (24–72 h). Our aim in the current study was to
focus on the activated T lymphocytes and macrophages that
were perhaps transmigrating into the brain post MCAO to
promote further localized brain injury even after a decline in
the inflammatory phase in the periphery, which was at its peak
at earlier time-points.
Our study clearly distinguishes key immunological differences
in females vs. males that provide crucial insights
into the development of their respective infarct sizes. Our
initial finding was that splenic atrophy after MCAO was less
severe in females than males (73 vs. 87 % reduction of
splenocytes, from Table 1). It is well established that stroke
leads to splenic atrophy characterized by a reduction of organ
size and a drastic loss of splenocyte counts along with
activation of apoptotic markers [15]. Recent publications
support the contention that splenic alterations in stroke result
from a proinflammatory response [20]. Thus, in keeping with
the smaller infarct in females and consistent with our previous
studies showing that splenic atrophy and resulting immunosuppression
are a function of stroke severity [15], it can
be predicted that less atrophy of spleen in females compared

to males is indicative of reduced proinflammatory activation
and consequent lesser infarct size.
Interestingly, although the total number of cells present in
the ischemic hemisphere of both male and female mice was
increased compared to sham-treated mice, the numbers in
female vs. male mice were not significantly different from
each other, suggesting differences in the composition of the
infiltrating cells. Indeed, we found significant differences in
T cell subsets and macrophages in the spleen and central
nervous system (CNS) in females vs. males after MCAO that
were not present in sham-treated mice (Tables 1 and 2). The
contribution of the immune-mediated inflammatory cascade
to MCAO has already received considerable attention in
male mice due likely to their larger infarcts. It has been
reported that expression of the adhesion molecule VLA-4
increases rapidly 96 h post MCAO among circulating macrophages
[15]. Activation of resident cells (mainly microglia
) and infiltration of monocyte/macrophages into the ischemic
brain tissue have also been reported [21], as well as the
profound recruitment of T cells to the ischemic brain after
stroke [19] that exacerbates brain damage caused by the
initial insult [14,22]. T lymphocytes are believed to migrate
to the brain, exacerbating neurodegeneration within 48 h
after stroke [20], and produce damage through the generation
of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators
[23], and superoxides [24,25]. Although recent studies
suggest causal relationships between T lymphocytes and
brain outcome [22, 26–28], comparable studies on the contribution
of activated immune cells to MCAO have not been
reported in female mice after MCAO. This is surprising as
there are known sex differences in T lymphocyte-mediated
autoimmunity [29–31].
Regarding T cells, our major findings were a significant
increase in CD4+ cells in spleens of males, but a significant
increase in CD8+ T cells in spleens of females after MCAO.
Although the increased level of CD8+Tcells could contribute
to CNS injury in female stroke, we also considered a possible
role for CD8+suppressor Tcells, noted previously by others to
mediate immunosuppression after CNS injury [32]. We did
not find any significant differences between males and females
in the adaptive CD8+ suppressor T cell population
(CD8+CD25+FoxP3+) (data not shown) or the less discussed,
naturally occurring CD8+ suppressor T cells (CD8+CD122+).
However, we did find a robust increase in the frequency of the
IL-10-secreting CD8+CD122+ suppressor T cell subset in the
brains of female vs. male mice after MCAO (Fig. 3). The
functional ability of this population of CD8+CD122+Tcellsto
release IL-10 has been described [33–35], as has their ability
to inhibit the expansion and release of inflammatory cytokines
by CD4+ T cells in EAE [ 36]. Both of these regulatory
functions of CD8+CD122+ T cells could play an important
role in limiting infarct size in female mice after MCAO.
However, implication of IL-10 as a regulatory cytokine
produced by these cells does not exclude a contribution by
other anti-inflammatory cytokines.
While not the focus of this study, estrogen could be
contributing to the differences in immune cell subsets we
observed in male and female mice. For example, not
addressed in our study are the potential effects of estrogen
on the induction of suppressor T cells. Dysfunction of regulatory
Tcells in estrogen-deficient mice may contribute to an
acceleration of organ-specific autoimmune lesions [37].
Estrogen in combination with progesterone has been found
to enhance regulatory responses to HPV in healthy women
[38] and likely provides greater neuroprotection in females
after MCAO. In fact, exogenous administration of both
hormones has been shown to improve outcome after cerebral
ischemia and traumatic brain injury in experimental models
[39]. This is also in accordance with our previous report that
estradiol deficiency exacerbates immunosuppression after
focal stroke in females [40]. Therefore, the significant increase
in IL-10 production by CD8+ suppressor T cells in
females after MCAO could be attributed to increased levels
of estrogen and progesterone. Finally, it is worth noting that
the majority of CD8+ T cells in females were not suppressor
T cells and these CD8+ T cells could well be responsible for
the worse prognosis over time in females with cerebral
ischemia [3].
One limitation of our study is that female mice were not
subjected to estrous cycle synchronization and were allowed
to cycle naturally. This was done in order to determine if sex
differences in infarct volume and immune cell subsets were
present even in the face of varying estrogen levels, as these
levels normally fluctuate in both female animals and humans
depending on age, stress, diurnal variation, and reproductive
cycle. Future studies will explore the contribution of estrogen
and other sex steroids to phenotypic changes in immune
cell subsets after focal cerebral ischemia by controlling sex
steroid levels through estrous cycle synchronization, reduction
of endogenous hormone levels via gonadectomy, and
exogenous hormone replacement in gonadectomized mice.
In congruence with larger infarct size in males, we found
that not only was the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes
higher in males but the expression of activation markers such
as CD69 and CD44 on CD4+T lymphocytes from the spleen
was also higher in males compared to females. These differences
were clearly due to MCAO as sham-treated males and
females did not exhibit any significant differences in either
CD69+ or CD44+ expression among CD4+ T lymphocytes
(Table 1). It has been reported already that stroke patients
had more CD69+ T cells than controls, indicative of T cell
activation [41], but ours is the first study to demonstrate that
this increase occurs in males but not females after MCAO.
Recruitment of bone marrow stromal cells in the brain by the
upregulation of CD44 after stroke has been reported [42] and
it has also been discussed that CD4+ T lymphocytes may

influence infarct size [1,14,22]. Therefore, our study, showing
that expression of these markers is gender dependent,
provides new insight into the mechanisms that distinguish
the development of stroke lesions in males vs. females. One
important conclusion is that the proposed hypothesis that
MCAO activates spleen cells to transmigrate and to produce
more damage in the injured brain cycle may largely be
restricted to males.
Along with the recruitment of T lymphocytes that has
been discussed thus far, there is also a massive infiltration
of monocytes/macrophages into the ischemic brain [21],
aided by significant increases in the expression of adhesion
molecules, including VLA-4 that was described previously
after MCAO [15]. Upregulation of adhesion molecules by
vascular endothelial cells allows infiltration into the brain of
blood neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells that
promote further brain injury [43]. In our current study, we
found that males had a higher expression of VLA-4 among
all cells in both spleen and brain compared to females, which
suggested a higher transmigration of activated cells in males
which again corresponds to a larger infarct size in males.
Moreover, we found an increased frequency of
CD45hiCD11b+ cells, which represent infiltrating macrophages
and activated microglia, in the ischemic right hemisphere
in males vs. females (Table 2). It is already well
known that CD45hiCD11b+ macrophages migrate into the
brain as a result of injury or infection [44,45], and the number of
activated microglia and macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+)inbrain
can serve to gauge the extent of inflammation and CNS injury
[46]. Therefore, the increases in activated microglia and macrophages
in the ischemic hemisphere in males would appear to be
a major contributor to the greater infarct size in males.
In conclusion, our study provides new evidence that the
extent of brain injury after stroke differs with gender and is
influenced by different patterns of immunological responses.
This new information suggesting gender-dependent mechanisms
of brain damage after stroke implies that effective
treatments for stroke may also be gender specific. For example
, males may respond better to anti-inflammatory therapies
that target activated Tcells and macrophages or inhibit VLA-
4 expression, whereas females may benefit from therapies
that inhibit CD8+ effector T cells and promote CD8+ suppressor
T cells. The key observations presented here clearly
support the need to confirm and extend the general understanding
of gender differences that contribute to stroke susceptibility
and severity.
