Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy
CADASIL is caused by more than a hundred NOTCH3 mutations. Virtually all
encoded mutant proteins contain an odd number of cysteines. As such, structural changes
in NOTCH3 may be the primary molecular abnormality in CADASIL. Thus, we sought
evidence for structurally altered NOTCH3 protein in CADASIL tissue. Four antibodies were
raised in rabbits against two non-overlapping N-terminal NOTCH3 sequences. These
reagents were used in immunohistochemical experiments to detect epitopes in postmortem
CADASIL brains (n¼8), control brains, and cells overexpressing NOTCH3.
To determine the biochemical nature of NOTCH3 epitopes, we used these antibodies to
probe pure NOTCH3–Fc fusion proteins treated with acid, urea, guanidinium, ionic
detergents, acrylamide, and thiol- and phosphorus-based reductants. All antibodies avidly
stained arteries in 8 of 8 CADASIL brain samples. The most prominent staining was in
degenerating media of leptomeningeal arteries and sclerotic penetrating vessels. Normal
appearing vessels from control brains were not reactive. Antibodies did not react with
cultured cells overexpressing NOTCH3 or with purified NOTCH3–Fc protein. Furthermore,
treatment of pure protein with acid, chaotropic denaturants, alkylators, and detergents
failed to unmask N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes. Antibodies, however, recognized novel N-
terminal epitopes in purified NOTCH3–Fc protein treated with three different reductants

N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes, suggesting the first evidence in vivo of NOTCH3 structural
alterations.

1. Introduction
In 1996, Joutel and colleagues first described mutations in
NOTCH3 in patients with CADASIL, an inherited disorder of
smooth muscle cells that causes leukoencephalopathy and
manifests as premature stroke and vascular dementia (Joutel
et al., 1996). Since then, more than one hundred independent
NOTCH3 mutations have been published (Chabriat et al., 2009),
the overwhelming majority of which are missense mutations
that change the number of cysteines in the predicted amino acid
sequence (Joutel et al., 1997). This results in an uneven number
of cysteine residues, which likely alters the tertiary structure of
Notch3.
The primary sequence of NOTCH3 features a large extracellular
domain which is the site of almost all mutations linked to
CADASIL (Joutel et al., 1997). As in homologous related proteins
(NOTCH1, 2, and 4), the NOTCH3 extracellular domain is composed
of an array of more than thirty EGF-like domains (Kopan
and Ilagan 2009). Each of these EGF-like domains contains six
conserved cysteine residues. Notch EGF-like structures that have
been elucidated at the atomic structural level feature six oxidized
cysteine residues that form three pairs of disulfide bonds
(Hiruma-Shimizu et al., 2010; Hambleton et al., 2004).
The conserved disulfide bonding of EGF-like repeats in other
extracellular matrix proteins (Knott et al., 1996; Rao et al., 1995)
suggests that disulfide pairing plays an important role in
structural stability of NOTCH3. Introduction or elimination of a
cysteine, which hallmarks most mutations seen in CADASIL, is
predicted to impair normal disulfide pairing within the NOTCH3
ectodomain and, consequently, may seriously disrupt the structure
of the protein. The ectodomain of NOTCH3, which harbors
all known CADASIL mutations, accumulates in the blood vessels
of patients (Joutel et al., 2000). One potential mechanism of
CADASIL pathogenesis, therefore, could be cysteine mutationdriven
structural alterations of the protein that drives protein
misfolding and accumulation. There is, however, no experimental
evidence demonstrating structural alterations of NOTCH3
proteininhumantissue.
We describe the discovery of novel N-terminal NOTCH3
epitopes in diseased arteries in human CADASIL brains. We
show that these epitopes are undetectable in native NOTCH3
protein, but can be unmasked specifically by disulfide bond
disruption. Our studies suggest an important role of reduced
cysteine in CADASIL pathogenesis.
2. Results
2.1. Identification of novel N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes
in CADASIL arteries
Two synthetic peptides were used to immunized rabbits
(Fig. 1A). Antisera 5209 and 5210 were raised against the wild
type C-terminal end of the first EGF-like domain. Antisera
2078 and 2079 were raised against the N-terminal end of the
second EGF-like domain that contained the canonical R90C
CADASIL mutation. All four antisera reacted unequivocally at
o1:2000 with 1 μg immobilized peptide immunogen.
Antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis
of CADASIL (n¼8) and control brain samples (n¼6). In
CADASIL arteries, antisera reacted strongly with thickened
white matter arteries (Figs. 1B and1C). The media of CADASIL
leptomeningeal arteries also reacted strongly with NOTCH3
antibodies in vessel layers that contain degenerating smooth
muscle (Fig. 2A and C). Morphologically normal arteries of
control brains did not react with antibodies (Fig. 2B and D).
Importantly, the 2078 and 2079 antisera, which were raised
against a peptide containing the R90C mutation, reacted with
the seven CADASIL brains which did not have the R90C
mutation. Staining of a brain with the R90C mutations was
not stronger than other samples, suggesting that the antibodies
react with CADASIL arteries but are not specific for the
R90C mutation.
Antibodies were also tested on cell lines overexpressing
wild type or mutant NOTCH3 (Fig. 3) that were fixed and
embedded in the same manner as brain tissues. Immunohistochemistry
performed on these samples using all four
antibodies to the N-terminal sequences of NOTCH3 did not
result in signal. This suggested that antibodies reacted with
NOTCH3 epitopes generated by post-translational processes
in vessels in CADASIL.
2.2. Unmasking of latent NOTCH3 N-terminal epitopes
by protein reduction
We purified recombinant NOTCH3 ectodomain (EGF domains
1–27) fused to immunoglobulin Fc to apparent homogeneity
using protein A chromatography. A wild type protein and the
R90C point mutation-containing protein were analyzed after
adsorbing proteins to nitrocellulose. None of the four antibodies
recognized native or mutant NOTCH3 ectodomain (UN
in Fig. 4).
We hypothesized that NOTCH3 could be modified from its
native state to reveal latent epitopes in the N-terminus. To
test this possibility, we chemically treated purified wild type
or R90C NOTCH3 fusions prior to probing with antibodies. Of
the six biochemical treatments initially tested, only DTT
converted wild type or mutant NOTCH3 to a form that was
recognized by antibodies (Fig. 4).
We then tested the effects of increasing concentrations of
DTT, beta-mercaptoethanol (a thiol reductant) and TCEP (a
phosphorus-based reductant) on NOTCH3 protein. All reductants
efficiently converted both wild type and R90C NOTCH3
to a form recognizable by all four antibodies (Fig. 5).

Since antibodies only bound to reduced NOTCH3, it was
possible that they interacted with thiol groups of NOTCH3.
If this were the case, we would expect that reduction followed
by alkylation of the protein would reduce antibody recognition.
However, addition of alkylating agents acrylamide or
iodoacetate after protein reduction did not affect antibody
reactivity (Fig. 4), suggesting that epitope recognition did not
require protein thiols.
3. Discussion
CADASIL has been extensively studied because, in part, it is
the most common small vessel disorder with an identified
monogenic cause (Chabriat et al., 2009). Stereotyped cysteine
mutations in NOTCH3 and accumulation of NOTCH3 protein
in vessels have suggested a proteinopathy involving NOTCH3,
but changes in the protein structure of NOTCH3 have yet to
be explored. Here, we present the first evidence of molecular
changes in the NOTCH3 protein in CADASIL brain tissue.
3.1. Characteristics of NOTCH3 N-terminal epitopes
The molecular changes in NOTCH3 described herein were
only found after protein reduction. Two classes of molecular
changes could account for induction of latent epitopes by
protein reduction: (1) an accessible (surface-exposed) region
of the protein shifts conformation and (2) an inaccessible
region of the protein moves to the surface of the protein and
becomes accessible to antibodies. The antibodies we used
were polyclonal and generated against peptides that likely
adopt many conformations. It would be unlikely that all four
polyclonal antibodies fail to bind accessible regions of the
protein, particularly after exposure of the protein to multiple
denaturing treatments (Fig. 4). The absence of polyclonal
antibody binding to native NOTCH3 is thus unlikely to result
solely from a conformational change in an antibodyaccessible
N-terminal target region.
A more likely possibility is that epitopes are shielded in
the native disulfide bonded protein and that reduction of
disulfide bonds frees the molecule from structural constraints
, allowing antibodies access to epitopes previously
buried in the N-terminus. As cysteine alkylation failed to
block antibody binding, the epitopes identified here do not
interact with antibodies via reduced cysteines. Because the
two peptides used to generate the antibodies are very close
within the primary sequence, we further hypothesize that the
end of the first EGF repeat and the beginning of the second
EGF repeat are both sequestered, unavailable to antibodies,
and may be in spatial proximity.

3.2. Potential mechanisms of N-terminal NOTCH3 epitope
unmasking
The NOTCH3 N-terminal epitopes are abundant in CADASIL
tissues but not normal-appearing control vessels or cells
overexpressing native NOTCH3. Moreover, antibodies raised
against N-terminal sequences of NOTCH3 bind strongly to
protein treated with reductants but not to native protein or
denatured NOTCH3 that remains oxidized. Together, these
findings suggest that vascular redox changes in NOTCH3 may
be one of the potential mechanisms for N-terminal epitope
unmasking in CADASIL. This possibility is further strengthened
by the stereotyped molecular genetics of CADASIL,
which support a critical role of NOTCH3 cysteine imbalance.
If reducing conditions indeed regulate latency of
NOTCH3 epitopes, two experimentalfindings need additional
explanation.
First, why do both wild type and mutant NOTCH3 require
chemical reduction for recognition by antibodies? The most
basic explanation is that a single cysteine mutation is
insufficient to cause CADASIL N-terminal NOTCH3 epitope
generation. Instead, multiple reduced cysteines (as in the
case of chemically reduced proteins) must occur to generate
CADASIL N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes. In CADASIL, a single
mutation may predispose the protein to further reduction
which consequently results in unmasking of N-terminal
NOTCH3 epitopes.
A second question raised by our results is: how does one
explain the finding that the same N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes
are unmasked in CADASIL samples that include a wide
range of cysteine mutations dispersed throughout NOTCH3?
Any molecular mechanism must account for how multiple
different NOTCH3 mutants each results in changes within
this focal area of the protein which, in some cases, is far
removed from the site of the mutation. In vessels, it is
possible that disulfides throughout NOTCH3 may slowly
isomerize by exchange of cysteine disulfide partners. Many
secreted proteins (e.g. RNase, BPTI, TSP) are known to shuffle
disulfide pairing. When mutant NOTCH3 containing an odd
number of cysteines undergoes disulfide isomerization,
reduced cysteines may migrate to wide regions of the protein
(Huang et al., 1997). A series of isomerizations could yield the
reduction of a critical cysteine important for generation of
CADASIL NOTCH3 N-terminal epitopes, even if the CADASIL
mutation is not at the N-terminus. Of note, remote effects of
NOTCH3 mutation have been reported before; separate mutations
in NOTCH3 have previously been observed to affect
glycosylation at a single site (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2005).
The model that CADASIL NOTCH3 N-terminal epitope
unmasking is gated by a critical cysteine is experimentally
testable; using the described antibodies, it may be feasible
to perform mutagenesis experiments to identify the
cysteine residue(s) required for generation of N-terminal
structural changes. Another possibility is that other factors

(C, D) stained leptomeningeal arteries of a CADASIL brain (A, C) but not those of a control brain (B, D). Staining in CADASIL was
observed in the medial layer of arteries that showed intense thickening due to intimal hyperplasia and medial fibrosis in
CADASIL. Antibodies 5209 and 2078 resulted in similar staining patterns.

(e.g. Notch-binding matrix proteins (Zhang et al., 2012; Meng
et al., 2009, 2010; Monet-Lepretre et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2013)), not active in our expression system, bind specifically
to NOTCH3 with a reduced cysteine. Subsequently, this factor
could facilitate the unmasking of N-terminal epitopes in
mutant NOTCH3 protein. The antibodies to NOTCH3
described herein could be utilized in biochemical assays to
identify such factors.
Eventual identification of molecular pathways leading to
exposure of new epitopes in NOTCH3 could provide insight
into biochemical pathways involved in small vessel pathology.
As such, our novel observations provide a launch point
to investigating structural alterations of NOTCH3 as a key
target in cerebral small vessel disease.
4. Experimental Procedures
4.1. Generation of polyclonal antibodies
Two peptide sequences from human NOTCH3 were used to
immunize rabbits (Fig. 1A). Immunization of amino acids
64–80 (ACLCPPGWVGERCQLED) resulted in antisera 5209 and
5210. Immunization of amino acids 85–95 with the R90C
substitution (GPCAGCGVCQS) resulted in antisera 2078 and
2079. For some studies, 5209 and 5210 were pooled and
affinity purified against the immunizing peptide. 2078 and
2079 were tested separately and both exhibited the same
specificity for CADASIL arteries and for reduced purified
NOTCH3 protein. Since both 2078 and 2079 reacted against
CADASIL tissues with diverse mutations and to wild type and
R90C proteins, we reasoned that the antisera was not specific
for the R90C mutant. These antibodies were used as crude
sera in experiments, unless specified.
The specificity of antisera was determined in multiple experiments
, described in Section 2.First,allserawerefoundtoreact
avidly against CADASIL but not against control tissues. Second,
all sera had significantly greater reactivity with reduced
NOTCH3–Fc compared to Fc control protein. Third, no specific
reactivity with vessels or purified protein was observed with preimmune
sera. Fourth, reactivity of 5209 and 5210 was more than
30- and 50-fold higher against reduced NOTCH3 compared to
NOTCH1 and NOTCH2. 2078 and 2079 reacted two- and six-fold
higher against NOTCH3 compared to NOTCH1 and NOTCH2.
Thus, 5209 and 5210 were significantly more specific than 2078
and 2079 for NOTCH3.
4.2. Immunohistochemistry
Brain tissue and genetic mutations in NOTCH3 from six
CADASIL patients have been described before (Zhang et al.,
2012). The study was granted an exemption from IRB review.

We examined two additional patients with the mutations
R153C and R141C. Locations of mutations of these patients
are shown in Fig. 1A. Control patients have been described
elsewhere (Dong et al., 2013). Tissue was processed into
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded sections followed by
citrate mediated antigen retrieval. Control stains were performed
on tissue sections with anti-H2 (sc-59467; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) to validate antigenicity of brain proteins in
archival material. Cell lines stably expressing NOTCH3 were
derive from human embryonic kidney 293 (293) cells stably
transfected with plasmids directing the expression of wild
type or mutant human NOTCH3 and have been previously
described (Meng et al., 2012). Cells were collected by centrifugation
, fixed in formalin, and then processed using the
same procedure used for brain tissue. All staining was
performed using Vector Elite ABC reagents.
4.3. Epitope characterization
The production and purification of recombinant NOTCH3 has
been described elsewhere (Meng et al., 2012). The protein
contains EGF-like repeats 1–27 from human NOTCH3 fused to
mouse Fc. Briefly, 293 cell lines stably transfected with
NOTCH3–Fc constructs were shifted to serum free media.
Media was collected and then passed over a protein A agarose
column. Fusion protein was eluted at with acidic buffer,
immediately neutralized with Tris pH 7.4, and then extensively
dialyzed. Mouse Fc was purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich.
To investigate determinants that unmask NOTCH3 epitopes
, chemicals that exert predicted effects on proteins were
mixed with NOTCH3 protein. For alkylation experiments,
proteins were mixed with reductants for 60 min at 37 1C,
and then a 10-fold molar excess of alkylating agent (compared
to thiol reductants) was added for an additional 60 min.
Protein (50 ng) was then spotted on nitrocellulose. Protein
spots were allowed to dry completely, and thefilter was then
rinsed extensively to remove small molecules. Primary antibodies
were added at 1:100 overnight, followed by detection
with infrared labeled secondary antibodies which were
detected on aflatbed scanner (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
