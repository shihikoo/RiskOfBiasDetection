Abstract
In preclinical studies of ischemic brain disorders, it is crucial to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, this requires
radiological techniques with heavy instrumentation or invasive procedures. Here, we propose a noninvasive and easy-to-use
optical imaging technique for measuring CBF in experimental small animals. Mice were injected with indocyanine green
(ICG) via tail-vein catheterization. Time-series near-infrared fluorescence signals excited by 760 nm light-emitting diodes
were imaged overhead by a charge-coupled device coupled with an 830 nm bandpass-filter. We calculated four CBF
parameters including arrival time, rising time and mean transit time of a bolus and blood flow index based on time and
intensity information of ICG fluorescence dynamics. CBF maps were generated using the parameters to estimate the status
of CBF, and they dominantly represented intracerebral blood flows in mice even in the presence of an intact skull and scalp.
We demonstrated that this noninvasive optical imaging technique successfully detected reduced local CBF during middle
cerebral artery occlusion. We further showed that the proposed method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the differences
between CBF status in mice anesthetized with either isoflurane or ketamine–xylazine, and monitor the dynamic changes in
CBF after reperfusion during transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The near-infrared optical imaging of ICG
fluorescence combined with a time-series analysis of the molecular dynamics can be a useful noninvasive tool for preclinical
studies of brain ischemia.

Introduction
Measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for the
diagnosis and monitoring of stroke patients. Nuclear imaging
methods that detect radioactive tracers by positron emission
tomography [1] and radiological imaging methods, such as
computed tomography (CT) [2,3] and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) [4,5], are widely used for noninvasive measurement
of CBF. In basic research involving small animals, the
application of these methods is restricted especially for longitudinal
studies due to limitations that include the high cost of equipment,
risk from radiation, and the low availability of portable devices. As
an alternative, optical approaches have gained increasing attention
for detection of CBF.
Optical methods for measuring CBF include the use of
fluorescent tracers and label-free techniques. Laser Doppler
flowmetry, a label-free optical technique, measures the velocity
of circulating red blood cells in the bloodstream by the Doppler
effect, and is commonly used to monitor the relative change in
CBF in experimental animals [6]. Optical micro-angiography,
based on optical coherence tomography, was recently developed
for the label-free measurement of blood velocity in small vessels in
mice [7]; however, practical applications of these techniques in the
preclinical setting are limited. Laser Doppler flowmetry is not
sensitive enough to estimate regional CBF and detects only the
relative changes [8]; whereas optical micro-angiography has a
critical limitation in that the scalp of small animals must be
removed to obtain sufficient resolution to identify red blood cell
movement in small vessels.
In contrast to label-free techniques, optical techniques using
fluorescent tracers can significantly enhance the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) using intravascular contrast agents. In addition, these
techniques have the advantage of extracting kinetic information by
time-series analysis of fluorescence signals after the bolus injection
of the tracers. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent probe
clinically used for liver function tests [9] and angiography in
ophthalmology [10]. ICG is excited in the near-infrared (NIR)
wavelength range [11], and deeper penetration of NIR wavelength
light in tissues is enabled due to a lesser degree of absorption and
scattering [12]. Intravenously injected ICG rapidly binds to serum
albumin and remains confined in the vessels until it is removed via
clearance through the liver [11]. Kinetic information of the ICG
bolus enhances detection of deep organs by enriching of organspecific
information including differences in filling and wash-out
patterns [13,14] and detection of tissue blood flow in experimental
animals [15,16] and humans [17–20]. Hillman et al. described

such approaches in detail and termed them dynamic contrast
enhancement (DyCE) technique [21]. We demonstrated recently
that analysis of ICG molecular dynamics can be used to estimate
peripheral tissue perfusion semi-quantitatively in mice [16] and
humans [17,22]. However, this approach has not been applied for
the detection of CBF due to the different hemodynamic
characteristics of the brain, which has a rapidly moving and
abundant blood supply. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has
been used primarily to detect ICG absorption signals in the brain
[23,24]. Measurement of CBF using NIRS and ICG was first
demonstrated to be effective in animals [15,25], and was then
rapidly applied to humans because of its noninvasive characteristics
[18,26–28]. However, detection of NIRS signals above the
human scalp is highly limited by the presence of a large amount of
noise. This limitation is mainly due to the thick extracerebral
tissues, including the scalp, skull, and dura mater; therefore, there
have been significant efforts to separate intracerebral from
extracerebral signals [27,29,30]. While methods such as CT or
MRI provide two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) images that
provide valuable information about CBF, NIRS can detect blood
flow information only at several points upon the head due to its
limited spatial resolution. It is reported that the detection of ICG
fluorescent signal is more sensitive than the detection of absorption
signals by NIRS when used as a point detection approach [31,32].
Woitzik and his colleagues obtained 2D blood flow maps using
ICG fluorescent imaging, although the method was applicable
only during an invasive surgical procedure where the scalp and
skull of the patient were totally removed [33].
While optical penetration is restricted by the thick extracerebral
tissues in humans, sufficiently high SNR can be achieved in
experimental small animals–such as mice–because of their
relatively thin extracerebral tissues. We propose an optical imaging
technique that measures CBF in mice noninvasively through a
combined ICG molecular dynamics analysis. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to examine the feasibility of
noninvasive fluorescence imaging for measurement of CBF in
small animals.
Results
Analysis of the Molecular Dynamics of ICG for Twodimensional
Measurement of CBF in Mice
To obtain the molecular dynamics of ICG in mouse brain, we
acquired time-series fluorescence images over the mouse head
after a bolus injection of ICG (Figure 1B). The dynamics in each
pixel typically consisted of the first peak followed by subsequent
peaks formed by systemic recirculation (Figure 1C). The relative
intensities and time points of each peak were distinct in different
tissues. The time point of the first peak over the cerebrum was
earlier than those in the large vein and the extra-cranial skeletal
muscle. The first peak in the skeletal muscle showed lower
intensity than later peaks. We extracted T
rising
values from the first
peak as a representative parameter of the status of tissue blood
supply. T
rising
was calculated by subtracting T
arrival
, the time of
appearance of the bolus, from the first peak time (T
peak
)
(Figure 1D). The average T
rising
value over a somatosensory
cortical region of nine mice anesthetized with isoflurane was
2.760.1 s. T
rising
values in each pixel were reconstructed to create
a 2D CBF map (Figure 1E). The CBF map clearly revealed the
shape of the mouse brain. This finding indicates that ICG
fluorescence imaging combined with analysis of molecular
dynamics can separate the brain from adjacent tissues using the
differences in hemodynamic parameters in mice with intact skulls.
Intracranial CBF was Dominantly Detected by Time-series
Optical Imaging of ICG Fluorescence
We next investigated whether the blood flow information
observed in the area of the shape of the mouse cerebrum on the
CBF map was originated from intracranial brain tissue. Above the
cerebral cortex of the mouse are multiple layers of extracerebral
tissues, including the scalp, skull, and dura mater. Because these
extracerebral tissues also have blood vessels and blood supply, we
compared fluorescence dynamics over the cranium to those
directly over the cerebrum. When we removed the extracerebral
tissues above the hemisphere of a scalp-removed mouse by
craniotomy with complete excision of the dura mater (Figure 2A),
we found no difference in the pattern in dynamics between the
contralateral region with the skull and dura mater and the
ipsilateral region lacking these extracerebral tissues (Figure 2B).
We further evaluated whether ICG fluorescence imaging with
time-series analysis of molecular dynamics could detect CBF
noninvasively. We shaved only the scalp to minimize the
invasiveness of the procedure. The CBF maps successfully
displayed the shape of the underlying brain both in white ICR
mice and black C57Bl/6 mice (Figure 2C and D). Even though
the dynamics of the extracerebral flow were not extractable from
the dynamics of the intracerebral flow, the degree of influence by
the extracerebral signals warranted further evaluation. Therefore,
we selectively blocked either the extracerebral or the intracerebral
blood flow by selective vascular occlusion, and subsequently
examined the CBF maps. To selectively reduce intracerebral
blood flow, we ligated the ICA and occluded the MCA by
inserting a suture filament that preserved the intact ECA
(Figure 2E). To selectively reduce the extracerebral flow, we
ligated the ECA (Figure 2F). Selective blockade of the intracerebral
blood flow prominently increased the T
rising
parameters of the
pixels in the ipsilateral hemisphere, both in a scalp-removed
mouse and in an intact-scalp mouse (Figure 2G and H). In
contrast, although ligation of the ECA effectively reduced the
delivery of ICG to the extracerebral tissues (Figure S1), it did not
significantly alter the T
rising
map regardless of scalp removal
(Figure 2I and J). These results collectively indicate that the timeseries
optical imaging of ICG fluorescence can successfully detect
blood flow, dominantly representing intracerebral blood flow even
in the presence of extracerebral tissues in mice.
Four Types of Blood Flow Map and Application to
Cerebral Ischemia
We next selected three more parameters in addition to T
rising
from the ICG time kinetics, with or without intensity information,
to improve the CBF estimates (Table 1). T
arrival
was selected as the
time axis. We calculated the mean transit time (MTT) as the
center of gravity of the dynamic curve and the blood flow index
(BFI) as the slope of the first peak [3,15]. Four parameters were
used to generate independent CBF maps. We investigated changes
in CBF maps under cerebral ischemia conditions. We induced
focal cerebral ischemia in mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) surgery. Representative CBF maps for a normal brain
before MCAO and an ischemic brain during MCAO are
displayed in Figure 3A. All four maps showed altered hemodynamic
parameters in the ischemic hemisphere compared to those
in the normal hemisphere. Lateral regions of the cerebral cortex
are supplied primarily by the middle cerebral artery (MCA), but
they also receive a fraction of their blood supply from the anterior
cerebral artery (ACA) on the medial side through anastomoses in
the case of MCAO [34]. In ischemic brains where the MCA is
occluded, flow from the ACA partially recovers the blood supply of

lateral regions. Consistent with this notion, the T
arrival
map
showed a gradual delay in the arrival of the ICG bolus from the
medial to the lateral side. However, in the T
rising
map, the entire
cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere showed increased T
rising
values. An increase in MTT was also observed in the ipsilateral
hemisphere. The dynamic analysis clearly indicated that not only
the lateral regions primarily supplied by the MCA but also the
medial regions supplied by the ACA received a decreased blood
supply by MCAO, although the ACA flow was not disturbed
directly. Because the dynamics observed in the supra-capillary
resolution dominantly represent capillary flow (Figure S2), the
delay in the arrival of the bolus through arterial vessels did not
match the tissue blood flow status estimated by T
rising
and MTT.
The BFI values, which utilize the rising time as the denominator,
were lower in the lateral regions, indicating a noticeable decrease
in blood volume.
Average values of parameters in the regions over left
somatosensory cortices in nine mice were calculated and
compared before and during MCAO (Figure 3B). Because T
arrival
is affected by the time of initiation of the bolus injection, only

ipsilateral ischemic hemispheres were compared to those in the

First, we anesthetized two groups of mice using different
anesthetics and compared their CBF maps. Inhalation of
isoflurane increases CBF, and injection of a ketamine–xylazine
cocktail (K–X) causes a decrease in CBF through its effects on
systemic hemodynamic functions [35–37]. In T
rising
maps, the
overall T
rising
value in mice anesthetized with K–X was larger than
that in mice anesthetized by isoflurane (Figure 4A). Average values
in somatosensory regions in the K–X group resulted in significantly

The CBF status of the two hemispheres could be identified in CBF
maps at each imaging time-point. These results indicate that CBF
maps can be used to monitor CBF status affected by hemodynamic
conditions or CBF changes after cerebral ischemic events.
Discussion
We demonstrated that optical imaging using the NIR fluorescence
dye, ICG, combined with a time-series analysis of the
molecular dynamics, can be used for noninvasive analysis of CBF.
The patterns of ICG dynamics were distinct in each tissue, and the
differences could be successfully expressed using four dynamic
parameters including the T
arrival
, T 
rising
, MTT, and BFI. Blood
flow maps generated using these parameters clearly identified the
shape of the mouse cerebrum and detected changes in CBF during
cerebral ischemia. Hair removal alone was sufficient for imaging of
normal and reduced CBF induced by selective vascular occlusion
surgery. We further confirmed that this technique can be used to
compare CBF status in animals anesthetized with different
anesthetics and to monitor changes in CBF after induction of
cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion.
Our results clearly demonstrate that the dynamics of the
intracerebral CBF are dominantly detected by dynamic fluorescence
imaging, even in the presence of extracerebral tissues. Due
to deeper penetration of NIR wavelength light, signals from
sufficiently deep brain tissue are collected, and the portion of
detected signals from the relatively thin extracerebral tissues may
be negligible. We found that the intensity of fluorescence signals
that originated below the scalp was up to four times higher than
those from within the scalp. A large portion of extracerebral
signals may be masked by strong intracerebral signals, and
qualitative analysis of intracerebral flow may not be practically
interrupted, as shown in Figure 2H.
Repetitive ICG injections and CBF measurements were feasible
as shown in Figure 4C. Reinduction of anesthesia after a recovery
period may require repeated catheterization procedures, and the
number of attempts for venous puncture on tail veins will be
limited. This may restrict the practical repeatability of ICG
imaging. During experiments, the injection route was retained
using catheterization; waiting 10 min was sufficient to carry out
subsequent ICG injections and imaging. However, excessive
repetition of injections should be avoided in a single animal over
a short period considering plasma volume overload.
Each of the four blood flow parameters provided unique
information regarding CBF, and the combined analysis enhanced
the interpretation of the CBF condition such as hypoperfusion,
anastomoses, and collateral blood supply induced by experimental
intervention of CBF. T
arrival
represents the first detectable bolus to
arrive through different passages. Under an ischemic condition,
T
arrival
could be used to indicate which blood supply feeds the
ischemic region. Even in the case in which the decrease in tissue
blood flow was not so prominent by a T
rising
map or a MTT map,
the T
arrival
map could be used to determine the success of an
attempt to interrupt arterial sources. The T
rising
parameter
provides a highest contrast map between ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres in MCAO and should be the first choice to
estimate changes in CBF status. Because the T
rising
parameter
eliminates the effect of injection time uncertainty by subtracting
T
arrival
, a direct comparison of T
rising
and its derivative, BFI is also
possible for results obtained from independent experiments. MTT
is traditionally introduced in radiological imaging methods [3] and
is currently used for analysis of ICG dynamics detected by
methods such as NIRS [27]. MTT is theoretically calculated from
the first passage of the bolus [38] but can also be calculated
without eliminating recirculation [39]. MTT is referred to as the
transition time after the bolus arrives at a pixel or a region of
interest, so it is subtracted by arterial input dynamics suitable for
the pixel or the region. Practically a large artery observed in the
same image is chosen for global use as an arterial input function.
As such large reference arteries are hard to utilize in 2D projected
fluorescence images, we calculated MTT using fixed interval
dynamics after T
arrival
without compensating for the arterial input
function. Although this approach may decrease MTT accuracy
compared to that observed in mice using other methods [40], it is
sufficient to compare region by region in the same hemisphere or
between two hemispheres in an identical mouse. Because a
relatively larger amount of information on the time axis is used to
calculate MTT than other parameters, the MTT is particularly
useful for analyzing low SNR dynamics. BFI is a parameter widely
used to analyze ICG dynamics [15,33]. BFI considers not only
temporal information but also intensity information. The intensity
value is used for blood volume information during derivation of
the BFI [15]. Therefore, the ICG injection volume determines the
scale of the BFI, and its control is important for comparisons
among animals.
Bolus arrival can be greatly affected by injection method, the
size of the animals, and environmental factors such as room
temperature. Automatically injecting the ICG bolus using a
syringe pump and triggered initiation of imaging acquisition will
reduces the variability of bolus arrival and enhance the accuracy of
T
arrival
parameters. T
rising
, MTT, and BFI are free from the
injection time variation, and they significantly distinguished the
ischemic hemispheres among individual experiments. However,
regardless of variation in injection time, all four parameters are
good candidates for analyzing blood flow in a single mouse to
compare region by region or an ipsilateral hemisphere with a
contralateral hemisphere.
We were not only able to detect local remarkable decreases in
CBF such as MCAO using CBF maps, but also global CBF
changes using different anesthetics or subtle changes in local CBF
using serial imaging during the course of transient MCAO
(Figure 4). K–X is expected to decrease CBF compared to
isoflurane [37], and all four CBF parameters showed corresponding
differences. However, users who compare CBF parameters
among animals anesthetized with different anesthetics must be
aware that MTT can be biased by the anesthetic. Decreased
hepatic ICG clearance by isoflurane, in contrast to increased liver
enzyme activity by K–X, may reduce the decrease in late-time
intensity [41,42]. Because MTT takes a larger portion of the
dynamics into account than do the other parameters, the central
gravity of the dynamic might be shifted to the right.
In this study, we used a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera at
a low frame rate (580 ms per frame) to enhance the SNR of NIR
fluorescence signals and increased the temporal resolution by postprocessing
of dynamics, including smoothing and interpolation.
Signals obtained by high SNR CCD enabled easy and accurate
determinations of the initiation points and the maximum points of
the first peak rise to calculate T
arrival
and T
peak
. Other acquisition
devices with high frame rates could also be used, and they may
provide high temporal resolution. However, fine algorithms to
determine T
arrival
and T
peak
might be required in the absence of
proper signal-processing procedures. Imaging with a higher frame
rate system was reported by Hillman et al., and alternative
mathematical approaches to extraction of different dynamic
components from complicated in vivo signals were introduced
[21]. The technical aspects of tail-vein injection were also
described in detail in that study. Despite the non-invasiveness
and accessibility advantages, CBF optical imaging by analysis of

the molecular dynamics of ICG has limitations in terms of
dimensionality. The acquired images were projected in two
dimensions, and this method cannot provide 3D blood flow
information, as provided by CT or MRI. According to the central
volume theorem, the regional CBF can be calculated by dividing
the fractional cerebral blood volume by the MTT [3]. However,
the reference arterial voxel required to adjust the MTT and to
calculate the fraction of blood volume cannot be obtained because
the arterial pixel was not identifiable due to poor resolution of the
current imaging setting, and the projected pixel contains
summated information from all of the vertically aligned nonarterial
voxels. Therefore, several hemodynamic parameters,
which can be calculated in 3D imaging techniques, may not be
applied in this 2D optical imaging method.
Other limitations of the current technique involve quantitative
calculation of CBF. First, T

peak
,T
max
,T
rising
, and MTT
are not expressed in terms of volume per unit time per unit tissue
weight (e.g., mL/100 g/min), the standard unit of tissue blood
flow. These parameters provide a qualitative rather than
quantitative comparison of CBF status. Especially under ischemic
conditions, a bolus can arrive from more than two arteries with
different time kinetics. Thus, the shape and height of the peaks are
altered, making it difficult to estimate the status of CBF using
simple parameters. Therefore, more than one parameter should be
considered for precise interpretation, and quantitative parameters
that do not depend on the shape of the peaks must eventually be
devised.
Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
Eight-week-old male ICR and C57Bl/6 mice were obtained
from Samtako (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) and Koatech
(Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea), respectively. ICR mice were
used for all experiments except imaging with intact scalps, which
was performed using C57Bl/6 mice. Animals were anesthetized
with either 1.5% isoflurane in 70% N
2
O and 30% O
2
with a
vaporizer or ketamine (0.1 mg/g wt) and xylazine (0.01 mg/g wt).
Isoflurane was used as a default anesthetic and the use of K-X was
indicated in the figure legends. All efforts were made to minimize
suffering. Body temperatures were monitored by rectal probe and
maintained at 3761uC using a temperature-controlled heat
blanket. The scalp was excised for ordinary ICG imaging, and
the scalp hair was shaved when imaging the intact scalp. A 262-
mm craniotomy was made with a dental drill above the left
parieto-temporal cortex and the dura mater was removed to image
the cerebral cortex without any extracerebral tissue. The head was
fixed in a stereotaxic frame using two ear-bars and a jaw-holder.
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology (Permit Number: KA2010-39) and performed in
accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org/
ARRIVE).
ICG Imaging
Tail veins were catheterized using a 30-gauge needle and
polyethylene (PE)-10 tubing. Cardiogreen (I2633; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to a
concentration of 0.5 g/L. A bolus of 1.5 mL/g wt cardiogreen
solution was injected manually through a tail vein catheter after
the start of the time-series imaging experiments. Time-series ICG
fluorescence signals were acquired using a custom-built device
manufactured by Vieworks Corp. (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of
Korea). The device was composed of two light-emitting diode
arrays emitting light with a peak intensity at 760 nm that passed
through a 760612 nm band-pass filters and a CCD camera with a
25 cm TV lens coupled with an 830612 nm band-pass filter
(Figure 1A). Twelve-bit grayscale images were captured every
580 ms for ,3 min, and the initial 40 frames were used to
generate blood flow maps.
Analysis of Fluorescence Dynamics
Time-series fluorescence images were analyzed by custom-built
graphic-user-interface software using Delphi 2009 (Embarcadero
Technologies, San Francisco, CA). ICG dynamics in each pixel
were processed to compensate for noise and low temporal
resolution (Figure 1D). They were smoothed using the Savitzky–
Golay algorithm with third order polynomials and interpolated to
a resolution of 11.6 ms per frame using the cubic spline method.
The half-intensity time (T
half
) was first identified to find T
arrival
and
T
peak
.T
half
was defined as the first time at which the intensity was
equal or greater than the median intensity. T
half
was traced
backward along the downslope until the intensity did not decrease,
and the destination time was designated T
arrival
. In the same
manner, T
half
was traced forward along the upslope until the
intensity did not increase, and the destination time was designated
T
peak
.T
rising
was calculated as the difference between T
arrival
and
T
peak
. MTT was calculated as the center of gravity of the dynamic
curve [3]. In this study, signals during the 20 s period after T
arrival
were used in the calculation. After adjusting the baseline intensity
to zero, the following equation was applied;
MTT~
P
t
t:I(t)
P
t
I(t)
ð1Þ
BFI was defined as the slope of the first peak [15]. The
definitions and calculations of the four parameters are summarized
in Table 1. Blood flow maps were generated by combining each
parameter in each pixel, and the range of the values matching the
grayscale intensity was adjusted and displayed under the map in
arbitrary units for BFI or in seconds for other parameters. BFI
values were normalized for display of each image, but not for
comparative analyses among hemispheres. Regions of 262mmin
left hemispheres whose centers were positioned 2 mm posterior
and 2 mm lateral from the bregma were used to calculate mean
blood flow parameters. Symmetric regions in the right hemispheres
were compared with the ischemic left hemispheres during
MCAO.
Selective Vascular Occlusion Surgery
MCAO surgery was performed to induce focal cerebral
ischemia using a protocol described previously, with some
modifications [43]. The neck was incised along the midline, and
the left common carotid artery (CCA), the external carotid artery
(ECA), and the internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed. The
CCA, ICA, and two positions on the ECA were ligated with 6-0
silk sutures. The ECA was cut partially between two ligated
positions, and a 5-0 rounded tip monofilament nylon suture was
introduced through the opening in the CCA. The ECA was
completely cut, and the suture direction was reversed toward the
ICA. We proceeded with the nylon suture for 9 mm from the
insertion position. Time-series images were obtained before the
surgery and at 15 min after MCAO. The suture was removed at
45 min after its insertion, the ECA was permanently ligated, and
the ligations applied to the ICA and the CCA were released for

transient MCAO. A series of ICG images was additionally taken at
5 min, and 2, 6, and 24 h after reperfusion. Two positions on the
ICA were ligated to selectively block the intracerebral blood
supply, and a nylon suture, identical to that used for the MCAO,
was inserted between the two positions and proceeded until
bifurcation of the MCA. The ECA was ligated to selectively block
the extracerebral blood supply.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as means 6 standard errors. Statistical
significance was assessed by two-tailed unpaired t-tests to compare
before and after MCAO surgery and between groups anesthetized
with either isoflurane or K–X. The two-tailed paired t-test was
used to compare the two hemispheres in mice under MCAO.

dominantly represents the capillary blood flow in a
region of an ischemic cortex. (A) Under anesthesia with K-X,
a fluorescence image was taken above an ischemic cortex of a
mouse that received left MCAO surgery during time-series
imaging. The images were obtained from a thinned skull window
using intravital fluorescence microscopy after a bolus injection of
2 MDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran. The arterial
branching patterns and their direction indicate that the pial
arteries shown are branched from the MCA (scale bar: 200 mm).
(B) Fluorescence dynamics of FITC in three arteries (a1, a2, and
a3), three regions lacking large vessels (c1, c2, and c3) and three
veins (v1, v2, and v3) are indicated. The averaged fluorescence
dynamics of a region of interest (white circle) and of ICG in the
same region after a bolus injection of ICG were compared.
