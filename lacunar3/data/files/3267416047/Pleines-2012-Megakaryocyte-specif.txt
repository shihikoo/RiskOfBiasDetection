Vascular injury initiates rapid platelet activation
that is critical for hemostasis, but
it also may cause thrombotic diseases,
such as myocardial infarction or ischemic
stroke. Reorganizations of the platelet
cytoskeleton are crucial for platelet
shape change and secretion and are
thought to involve activation of the small
GTPase RhoA. In this study, we analyzed
the in vitro and in vivo consequences of
megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific
RhoA gene deletion in mice. We found a
pronounced macrothrombocytopenia in
RhoA-deficient mice, with platelet counts
of approximately half that of wild-type
controls. The mutant cells displayed an
altered shape but only a moderately reduced
life span. Shape change of RhoA-
deficient platelets in response to G13-
coupled agonists was abolished, and it
was impaired in response to Gq stimulation.
Similarly, RhoA was required for
efficient secretion of  and dense granules
downstream of G13 and Gq. Furthermore
, RhoA was essential for integrinmediated
clot retraction but not for
actomyosin rearrangements and spreading
of activated platelets on fibrinogen. In
vivo, RhoA deficiency resulted in markedly
prolonged tail bleeding times but
also significant protection in different
models of arterial thrombosis and in a
model of ischemic stroke. Together, these
results establish RhoA as an important
regulator of platelet function in thrombosis
and hemostasis. (Blood. 2012;119(4):
1054-1063)
Introduction
Platelet activation on the injured vessel wall is induced by multiple
signaling pathways and leads to extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements
that are crucial for conversion from discoid to spheric shape,
granule secretion, spreading, and clot retraction. Many of these
processes are thought to involve proteins of the Rho family of small
GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.1
Like most Rho GTPases, RhoA ( 23 kDa) is active when
bound to GTP, whereas the protein is inactive in the GDP-bound
state. The active state enables RhoA to bind effector molecules
such as Rho-associated, coiled-coil–containing protein kinase
(ROCK) and mammalian diaphanous homologue (mDia). RhoA
plays a central role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in
various cell types, mainly through its ability to form stress fibers
and to regulate actomyosin contractility.2 In addition, RhoA has
been implicated in numerous further cellular processes, such as
cytokinesis, regulation of microtubule dynamics, and the formation
of focal adhesions.3,4
Platelet activation by soluble agonists, such as adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A
2
(TxA
2
), or thrombin, induces
signaling through receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins
(G
q
, G 
i
, and G
13
).5 Studies on mice deficient in the G protein
subunits G
13
6and G
q
,7-9as well as inhibitor studies using human
platelets10-14 demonstrated a critical involvement of RhoA in the
induction of platelet shape change downstream of G
13
after
stimulation with low doses of the TxA
2
analog U46619 or
thrombin. In detail, RhoA-mediated activation of ROCK and
subsequent inhibition of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase
induces MLC phosphorylation, leading to actomyosin modulation
and conversion from discoid to spheric platelet shape. In addition
to the G
13
-RhoA-ROCK pathway, MLC phosphorylation is thought
to be achieved by stimulation of G
q
and subsequent phospholipase
(PL) C activation, leading to Ca2-mediated stimulation of MLC
kinase.
In contrast to its function in platelet shape change, the role of
RhoA for integrin regulation and degranulation is less well defined.
Whereas most studies revealed unaltered inside-out activation of
the main platelet integrin IIb3 on inhibition of RhoA, several
reports suggested a role of the GTPase for IIb3-dependent
outside-in signaling important for irreversible aggregation, clot
retraction, and sustained platelet adhesion under high shear in
vitro.6,15-17 Interestingly, a discrete spatiotemporal regulation of
RhoA in platelets was recently proposed, involving RhoA activation
during the initial phase of platelet activation, its inhibition
during the spreading process, and its reactivation in the late phase
of activation during clot retraction.18
Despite the numerous studies addressing the role of RhoA in
platelets, the use of inhibitors acting on Rho and ROCK or of mice
deficient in proteins upstream of the GTPase may cause misleading

results.19Here, we assessed the role of RhoAfor platelet function in
vitro and in vivo using mice in which RhoA deficiency is restricted
to megakaryocytes and platelets. We show that RhoA is involved in
different cellular responses downstream of G
13
- and G
q
-coupled
agonist receptors and integrinIIb3 that critically contribute to
platelet function in hemostasis and experimental thrombotic
diseases.
Methods
Animals
Mice in which exon 3 of the RhoA gene is flanked by loxP sites (RhoAfl)20
were crossed with platelet factor (PF) 4 Cre mice21 resulting in RhoAfl/fl,PF4-Cre
(hereafter named RhoA/) mice. Littermates (RhoAfl/fl, hereafter named
wild type) served as controls. Mice were maintained on a SV/129/C57/Bl-6
background. If not stated otherwise, 8- to 12-week-old mice of mixed
gender were used for all experiments. Animal studies were approved by the
district government of Lower Franconia (Bezirksregierung Unterfranken).
Chemicals and reagents
The anesthetic drugs medetomidine (Pfizer), midazolam (Roche Pharma),
and fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag) were used according to the regulation of the
local authorities. ADP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PAR-4 peptide
(Thermo Fisher Scientific); high-molecular-weight heparin, phalloidin-
FITC, human fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich); -thrombin (Roche Diagnostics
); anti-RhoA antibody (Cytoskeleton); anti-MLC, anti–phosphoSer19-
MLC antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology); anti–mouse-IgG HRP, anti–
rabbit-IgG HRP (Dako Deutschland); and apyrase type III (GE Healthcare)
were purchased from the indicated sources. Collagen-related peptide was
generated as described previously.22 The antibody against the activated
form of integrinIIb3 (JON/A-PE) was from Emfret Analytics. All other
antibodies were generated and modified in our laboratory as described
previously.23
Platelet preparation, spreading, and aggregometry
Platelet-rich plasma (prp) and washed platelets were prepared as described
recently.24 For spreading experiments, coverslips were coated with 200g
of human fibrinogen and blocked with 1% BSA. Washed platelets (100L
with 0.03 106 platelets/L) were added and incubated at room temperature
for the indicated times. Platelets were visualized with an Axiovert 200
inverted microscope (100/1.4 NA oil objective; Carl Zeiss). Platelet
aggregation was measured on a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer
(APACT Laborgera¨te und Analysensysteme) using prp or washed platelets
as described previously.24
Electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy, platelets were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and embedded in Epon.
Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and
examined under a CM120 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss).
For scanning electron microscopy, platelets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde.
Platelets in suspension were allowed to adhere to poly-L-lysine–
coated coverslips. Samples were dehydrated, air-dried, sputtered with gold,
and examined under a scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis
Flow cytometric measurements were performed as described previously.24
For Western blot analysis, blotted platelet lysates were probed with
appropriate primary and secondary HRP-coupled antibodies. Proteins were
visualized by ECL.
Platelet adhesion on collagen and VWF under flow conditions
Coverslips were coated with 0.25 mg/mL fibrillar type I collagen (Nycomed)
and blocked with 1% BSA. Perfusion of heparinized whole blood was
performed as described previously.25 To study platelet adhesion to VWF,
coverslips were coated with anti–human VWF antibody (Dako Deutschland),
followed by blocking with BSA and addition of murine platelet-poor
plasma for 2 hours at 37°C. Perfusion of heparinized whole blood was
carried out as described previously.26Phase-contrast pictures were analyzed
using MetaMorph software (Visitron).
Determination of platelet life span
Mice were injected intravenously with Dylight-488–conjugated anti-GPIX
Ig derivative (0.5g/g body weight), and the platelet life span was
determined as described previously.24
Bleeding time
Mice were anesthetized, 1 mm of the tail tip was cut off, and the tails were
immersed in 0.9% isotonic saline at 37°C. The time until stop of bleeding
(no blood flow for 1 minute) was determined.
Intravital microscopy of thrombus formation in FeCl3-injured
mesenteric arterioles
Intravital microscopy was performed as described previously.27 In brief,
injury of mesenteric arterioles was induced by topical application of 20%
FeCl3. Adhesion and aggregation of fluorescently labeled platelets in
arterioles was monitored for 40 minutes or until complete occlusion
occurred (blood flow stopped for 2 minutes).
Mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta
The abdominal cavity of anesthetized mice was opened to expose the
abdominal aorta. An ultrasonic flowprobe (0.5PSB699; Transonic Systems)
was placed around the vessel, and thrombus formation was induced by a
single firm compression with a forceps upstream of the flowprobe. Blood
flow was monitored for 30 minutes.
tMCAO model
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed as
described previously.25 In brief, a thread was advanced through the carotid
artery into the middle cerebral artery to reduce cerebral blood flow and
removed after 1 hour to allow reperfusion. The extent of infarction was
quantitatively assessed 24 hours after reperfusion on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride–stained brain sections. Global neurologic status was scored according to
Bederson et al. Motor function and coordination were graded using the grip test.
Data analysis
Results are shown as mean	 SD from 3 individual experiments per group,
unless indicated otherwise. Statistical analysis between wild-type and
RhoA/ groups were assessed by the Welch t test. P values 
 .05 are
considered statistically significant.
Results
RhoA/ mice display macrothrombocytopenia
Mice in which exon 3 of the RhoA gene was flanked by loxP sites20
were crossed with PF 4 Cre mice,21 leading to efficient loss of
RhoA protein in platelets of the resulting RhoA/ mice (Figure
1A). RhoA deficiency resulted in pronounced macrothrombocytopenia
, with a reduction of platelet counts by  50% (P
 .001;
Figure 1B) and an increase in platelet volume by  25% in
RhoA/ compared with wild-type mice (P
 .001; Figure 1C).

Transmission electron microscopy illustrated the increased size and
revealed a more roundish shape of RhoA/ platelets compared
with the discoid-shaped wild-type platelets (Figure 1D).
Despite the altered shape, the subcellular morphology was
similar in RhoA/ and wild-type platelets (data not shown).
Flow cytometric measurement of major platelet surface receptors
revealed a significant (12%-30%) increase in mean fluorescence
intensities for CLEC-2 and integrins 1 and IIb3 in 
RhoA/ compared with wild-type platelets (Table 1). This may
be because of the increased size of the mutant platelets, whereas
comparable mean fluorescence intensities in wild-type and
RhoA/ platelets for all other used glycoprotein antibodies
indicated moderately reduced surface density of these glycoproteins
in mutant platelets. Together, these results demonstrated
markedly reduced platelet counts but only moderate changes in
platelet morphology in the absence of RhoA in platelets and
megakaryocytes.
To determine whether the macrothrombocytopenia in RhoA/
mice was caused by an increased platelet turnover, the life span of
RhoA/ platelets in vivo was determined (Figure 1E). Interestingly
, however, RhoA/ platelets displayed only a moderately
reduced life span that alone does not explain the severely reduced
platelet counts in the deficient animals. Analysis of bone marrow
sections revealed that the number of megakaryocytes was markedly
increased in RhoA/ compared with wild-type mice, with a higher
percentage of megakaryocytes displaying high ploidy (supplemental
Figure 1A-B, available on the Blood Web site; see the
Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). This
indicates that the macrothrombocytopenia in RhoA/ mice represents
a failure in the terminal stages of platelet production from the
deficient megakaryocytes in vivo.
Defective shape change ofRhoA/ platelets after stimulation
of G13 signaling
To clarify the role of RhoA for platelet shape change and
aggregation, standard aggregometry was performed. At low
agonist concentrations, the receptors of the TxA
2
analog U46619
and thrombin mediate platelet activation predominantly by
coupling to G
13
, whereas higher agonist concentrations induce
additional signaling via G
q
.9,29 Stimulation with very low doses
of U46619, thrombin, and the thrombin receptor agonist PAR-4
peptide led to pronounced shape change and MLC phosphorylation
in wild-type platelets, whereas these processes were
abolished in RhoA/ platelets (Figure 2A and supplemental
Figure 1C-D). Notably, higher concentrations of U46619, thrombin or
PAR-4 peptide induced shape change and MLC phosphorylation in
RhoA/platelets but to a lesser extent than in the wild-type (Figure 2A
and supplemental Figure 1C-D). Together, these results revealed that
RhoA is indispensable for shape change induced by G
13
signaling in
platelets and also indicated a contribution of the GTPase in this process
downstream of G
q
stimulation. This hypothesis was supported by the
finding that ADP also failed to mediate shape change in RhoA/
platelets at a very low (0.025M) concentration (Figure 2B top panel).
Remarkably, activation with the glycoprotein (GP) VI agonist
collagen and to a lesser extent collagen-related peptide
(CRP), which induce platelet activation via signaling of the
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of the
GPVI-associated FcR chain,30 also resulted in reduced shape
change in RhoA/ compared with wild-type platelets (Figure
2B middle and bottom panels). In contrast, pronounced phosphorylation
of MLC was evident after stimulation with high
concentrations of CRP, indicating that GPVI signaling is
principally able to induce MLC phosphorylation also in the
absence of RhoA (supplemental Figure 1C).

Impaired aggregation ofRhoA/ platelets on stimulation with
agonists coupling to G13 and Gq
Apart from partially reduced shape change, stimulation with the
weak agonist ADP that signals via G
q
- and G
i
-coupled receptors
and does not trigger granule release by itself caused normal
aggregation of RhoA/ platelets, indicating largely functional
signaling by these G protein subunits in the absence of RhoA
(Figure 2B top panel). Furthermore, aggregation responses to high
concentrations of CRP and collagen were comparable between
RhoA/ and wild-type platelets and even enhanced at lower
concentrations, confirming that GPVI-triggered activation is largely
intact in RhoA/ platelets (Figure 2B middle and bottom panels,
C). The increased reactivity of the mutant cells to low doses of
GPVI agonists may be explained by their increased size and the
corresponding higher number of dense granules per platelet
compared with wild-type platelets, which may lead to the release of
higher amounts of ADP, ATP, or both on activation with threshold
concentrations of these agonists (supplemental Figure 1E).
Remarkably, U46619- and PAR-4 peptide–induced aggregation
was significantly reduced in RhoA/ platelets at intermediate
agonist concentrations but normal at high agonist concentrations
(Figure 2A,C). In contrast, thrombin induced similar aggregation of
RhoA/and wild-type platelets irrespective of the used concentration
(Figure 2A,C).
Reduced integrin activation and granule release inRhoA/
platelets on G13 and Gq stimulation
To address the effect of RhoA deficiency on integrin activation and
degranulation in further detail, activation of the main platelet
integrinIIb3 and surface exposure of granular P-selectin in
response to different agonists were analyzed by flow cytometry in
highly diluted platelet suspensions. Under these experimental
conditions, the accumulation of secondary agonists is largely
excluded.6 Stimulation with ADP or U46619 alone resulted in
comparable integrinIIb3 activation in RhoA/ and wild-type
platelets (Figure 3A). However, costimulation with these 2 agonists
, as well as activation with thrombin or PAR-4 peptide (Figure
3A; data not shown) led to a small ( 15%) but significant
reduction in integrin activation in RhoA/ compared with wildtype
platelets. In contrast, analysis of Gna13fl/fl, PF4-Cre (G
13
/)
mice revealed that deficiency of this G protein subunit did not
affect platelet count, size, and platelet surface receptor expression
(supplemental Figure 2A). In accordance with earlier results,6
G
13
/platelets displayed unaltered integrin activation compared
with the wild-type in response to all tested agonists (supplemental
Figure 2B top panel). Interestingly, RhoA/ platelets also showed
decreased integrin activation levels in response to stimulation of
the hemITAM receptor CLEC-227 by rhodocytin, although they
reacted normally on activation of the GPVI-ITAM pathway by
CRP and the snake venom toxin convulxin (Figure 3A).
In contrast to the moderate changes in integrin activation, RhoA/
platelets displayed pronounced defects in  granule release after
stimulation of G
13
and G
q
by thrombin and PAR-4 peptide (Figure 3B;
data not shown). Furthermore, whereas activation with ADP or U46619
did not lead to detectable degranulation,29 a combination of both
agonists induced strong P-selectin exposure in wild-type platelets but
not RhoA/ platelets (73% reduction; P
.001; Figure 3B). In
contrast, RhoA/ platelets displayed normal degranulation on stimulation
with agonists inducing (hem)ITAM signaling, namely, CRP,
convulxin, and rhodocytin. Consistently, lumi-aggregometry revealed
that the release of dense granules was also decreased in RhoA/

platelets after stimulation with high and intermediate concentrations of
U46619 and PAR-4 peptide, but comparable with the wild-type after
stimulation with thrombin, as well as on induction of GPVI signaling by
collagen or CRP (supplemental Figure 3A).
Slightly different results were obtained with G
13
/ platelets
that displayed decreased P-selectin exposure only after activation
with PAR-4 peptide (data not shown) or ADP plus U46619 (43%
reduction; P
 .01; supplemental Figure 2B bottom panel; Moers
et al6). Thus, RhoA is critically involved in and dense granule
release on G
13
and, to a lesser extent, G
q
stimulation, whereas the
GPVI-ITAM pathway is not affected by RhoA deficiency.
RhoA is dispensable for agonist-induced Ca2 mobilization in
platelets
The above-mentioned results revealed an involvement of RhoA in
signaling by G
q
. To assess whether RhoA deficiency influenced
PLC activation and subsequent Ca2 mobilization downstream of
this G protein subunit,29changes in intracellular calcium concentrations
[Ca2]
i
in response to U46619 (3M) and thrombin (0.1 U/
mL) were assessed using CRP (10g/mL) as a control (supplemental
Figure 3B-C). Notably, Ca2 release from intracellular stores
was unaltered in RhoA/ compared with wild-type platelets in
response to all tested agonists, indicating that RhoA is dispensable
for activation of PLC, as well as PLC2 in platelets. Furthermore,
direct activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate
resulted in similar integrin IIb3 activation and P-selectin
expression levels in RhoA/ and wild-type platelets (data not
shown). These results demonstrated that RhoA is not required for
Ca2mobilization and PKC-mediated responses downstream of G
q
and GPVI-ITAM signaling in platelets.
RhoA/ platelets spread normally on fibrinogen but exhibit
abolished integrin-dependent clot retraction
Ligand binding to integrin IIb3 induces outside-in signaling,
leading to cytoskeletal reorganizations and platelet spreading. The
role of RhoA in these processes has been controversially debated
with reports suggesting that RhoA is either required,31 dispensable
,15 or has to be inhibited18 for spreading. To test this directly,
mutant and wild-type platelets were allowed to spread on a
fibrinogen-coated surface in the presence of thrombin (Figure 4).
Differential interference contrast microscopy and scanning electron
microscopy demonstrated that RhoA/ platelets formed filopodia
and lamellipodia to the same extent and with similar kinetics as
wild-type platelets, resulting in full spreading after 30 minutes
(Figure 4A; supplemental Figure 4A; supplemental Videos 1-2).
Interestingly, although RhoA deficiency did not affect the ability of
the mutant platelets to assemble filamentous (F)–actin in response

to activation (supplemental Figure 4D), the morphology of spread
RhoA/ platelets was slightly altered. This was evident in a less
condensed cell body, a broader distribution of  granules, and a
partially more diffuse F-actin pattern in the mutant platelets (Figure
4A right panel inset; supplemental Figure 4B-C). Furthermore,
microtubule coils seemed less pronounced and partially fragmented
in the majority of spread RhoA/ platelets compared with wildtype
(Figure 4B). Remarkably, G

on fibrinogen on activation, standing in clear contrast to a recent study

knockdown platelets18(supplemental Figure 4E).
IntegrinIIb3 outside-in signaling also regulates clot retraction
,32,33 and the role of RhoA in this process is controversial.15,18
To address this directly, clot formation was induced in prp from
wild-type and RhoA/ mice by the addition of thrombin (5 U/mL,
20mM Ca2). Although clot retraction started already after 30 minutes
in wild-type prp and proceeded to the maximum after 4 hours,
the process was virtually abolished in RhoA/ prp (Figure 4C).
Together, these data demonstrate that RhoA is not required for
spreading of activated platelets on fibrinogen but that it is
indispensable for integrin-mediated clot retraction.
RhoA/ platelets display moderately reduced aggregate
formation on collagen and increased rolling velocity on VWF at
high shear
Thrombus formation at the site of vascular injury requires stable
platelet adhesion on the extracellular matrix as well as auto- and
paracrine platelet activation by locally released secondary mediators.29To address the effect of RhoA deficiency on these processes,
platelet adhesion to collagen was studied in a whole blood perfusion
system. In these experiments, blood from RhoA/ mice was reconstituted
with isolatedRhoA/platelets to normalize platelet numbers.
Perfusion of blood over immobilized collagen at a shear rate of
1700 seconds1 resulted in large platelet aggregates of comparable
size in RhoA/ and wild-type blood (mean surface coverage,
52.3%	 4.3% vs 53.7%	 6.0%; P .68; supplemental Figure
5A). This was not because of side effects caused by platelet reconstitution
, because experiments using nonreconstituted blood also revealed
similar aggregate formation in RhoA/ and wild-type blood when
determining the surface coverage relative to the platelet count (supplemental
Figure 5B right panel). However, at higher shear rates (7700 seconds1), resembling flow conditions in small arterioles or stenosed
arteries, aggregate formation of RhoA/ platelets was moderately but
significantly reduced compared with the wild-type (mean surface
coverage, 3.2%	0.9% vs 5.2%	1.8%; P
.05; supplemental Figure
5C), indicating that RhoA signaling contributes to stable platelet
adhesion and aggregate formation at high shear.
At lower shear rates, platelet adhesion and aggregation is
primarily dependent on integrinIIb3. In contrast, at very high
shear, the interaction of platelet GPIb with VWF becomes increasingly
important for platelet adhesion.34 To test whether reduced
aggregate formation in RhoA-deficient blood at high shear was
caused by altered GPIb-VWF interaction, platelet adhesion to
immobilized murine VWF was analyzed (Figure 5A-B). Whereas
the number of attaching platelets at 7700 seconds1 was similar in
RhoA/ and wild-type blood (174.2	 48.0/2500m2 vs
218.7	 30.8/2500m2; P .09; Figure 5A left panel, B), the
interaction of the mutant platelets with VWF was less stable,
resulting in increased velocity of rolling RhoA/ compared with
wild-type platelets (mean distance/minute, 26.4	 7.8m vs 
16.1	 2.3m; P
 .05; Figure 5A right panel).
RhoA is required for the formation of stable thrombi in vivo
To examine to which extent the observed defects of RhoA/
platelets in vitro influenced thrombotic events in vivo, thrombus
formation after injury of small mesenteric arterioles by FeCl
3
was
assessed using intravital fluorescence microscopy (Figure 5C-D).
Although initial aggregate formation was comparable between
wild-type and RhoA/ mice (data not shown), subsequent formation
of stable thrombi was strongly impaired in RhoA/ mice
compared with the wild-type, resulting in complete vessel occlusion
in 89% (8 of 9) of wild-type arterioles (mean time to
occlusion, 16.9	 2.9 minutes; Figure 5C left panel, D), but only
21.5% of RhoA/ vessels (P
 .01). In 57% of arterioles of
RhoA/ mice, no occlusion occurred during the observation
period of 40 minutes and further 21.5% of the vessels recanalized
after short (
 2 minutes) occlusion (Figure 5C right panel, D). The
defective thrombus formation inRhoA/mice was mainly characterized
by embolization of fragments after the thrombus had
reached a certain size, demonstrating a critical role of RhoA for
thrombus stabilization in vivo. Similar results were obtained when

the mice were tested in a second thrombosis model in which
thrombus formation was induced by mechanical injury of the
abdominal aorta (Figure 6A-C). Although stable occlusion occurred
in 9 of 10 wild-type mice within 8 minutes (mean time to
occlusion, 384	 79 seconds; Figure 6A-C), blood flow inRhoA/
mice only decelerated to 50% of the initial value after injury and,
apart from some fluctuations indicating thrombus embolization,
remained rather constant until the end of the observation period of
30 minutes (P
 .001; Figure 6A-C). Importantly, the thrombus
formation defect in RhoA/ mice was not because of the macrothrombocytopenia
in the deficient animals: Wild-type mice in
which the platelet count was reduced to 50% of normal and that
displayed platelet sizes comparable with RhoA/ mice formed
stable occlusive thrombus formation within a similar time frame as
the controls (supplemental Figure 5D).
Together, these results demonstrate that RhoA is required for
thrombus stabilization in small, as well as in large arteries
irrespective of the type of injury.
Defective hemostasis inRhoA/ mice
To assess the impact of RhoA deficiency on hemostasis, tail
bleeding times were determined (Figure 6D). Whereas bleeding
stopped in 15 of 16 (94%) wild-type mice (mean bleeding time,
179	 196 seconds), bleeding times were dramatically increased
in RhoA/ mice (13 of 18 bled for  20 minutes;
P
 .001; Figure 6D). Interestingly, in many of the RhoA/
mice, blood loss temporarily decreased or even transiently
stopped for several seconds but then increased again (data not
shown). This indicates that RhoA is required for stabilization of
clots not only in intravascular thrombus formation but also in
normal hemostasis.
RhoA/ mice are protected from ischemic brain infarction
Cerebral ischemia is a complex disease in which the microvascular
integrity is disturbed, resulting in acute inflammation and neuronal
cell death. Platelets contribute to this pathology by mechanisms
involving GPIb-VWF interactions but obviously not integrin
IIb3-dependent aggregation. However, the exact underlying
mechanisms have not been identified.35-37
To investigate the impact of RhoA deficiency in this pathology,
mice were challenged in a model of experimental cerebral ischemia
using the tMCAO model36 (Figure 7). Strikingly, in RhoA/ mice,
brain infarct volumes were reduced to  50% of the infarct
volumes in wild-type mice (43.7	 30.5 mm3vs 80.1	 28.8 mm3;
P
 .01; Figure 7A). This translated into significantly less severe
neurologic deficits compared with wild-type mice, determined by
Bederson score assessing global neurologic function (1.2	 1.3 vs
2.9	 1.6; P
 .05; Figure 7B) and grip test that indicates motor
function and coordination of the mice (3.7	 0.7 vs 2.6	 1.0;
P
 .01; Figure 7C). These data revealed an important involvement
of RhoA-dependent signaling in platelets for the propagation
of ischemic stroke.
Discussion
In this study, megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific knockout mice
for RhoA were used to assess the role of the GTPase for platelet
function in vitro and in vivo. We show that RhoA deficiency leads
to macrothrombocytopenia and signaling defects downstream of
G
13
- and G
q
-coupled receptors, resulting in severely impaired
hemostasis and marked protection in models of arterial thrombus
formation and ischemic stroke.
The pronounced macrothrombocytopenia in RhoA-deficient
animals was associated with largely normal platelet morphology,
only moderately increased platelet turnover (Figure 1B-E), and

increased numbers of mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow
of the mutant mice (supplemental Figure 1A-B). These findings
strongly indicate a critical involvement of RhoA in the terminal
stages of platelet production, as suggested previously by in vitro
studies.38,39The defects in platelet formation in the mutant mice are
currently under investigation.
In line with indirect studies, our results confirm the essential role of
RhoA signaling for platelet shape change and MLC phosphorylation on
induction of G
13
signaling6-14(Figure 2 and supplemental Figure 1C-D).
However, our findings clearly (Figure 2) suggest an involvement of
RhoA signaling in these processes also downstream of G
q
. This
hypothesis is in line with studies using G
q/13
double-deficient platelets40and mouse embryonic fibroblasts that show that receptors coupled
to G
13
and G
q
/G
11
can activate RhoA via G
q
/G
11
at high agonist
concentrations.9 In addition, our data emphasize that RhoA/ROCK-
mediated inhibition of MLC phosphatase is the primary pathway for
MLC phosphorylation in response to agonists coupling to G
13
and G
q
,as
suggested by studies using human platelets.13
Interestingly, we observed a shape change defect in RhoA/
platelets in aggregometry on stimulation with GPVI agonists
(Figure 2) despite pronounced MLC phosphorylation after activation
with high concentrations of CRP (supplemental Figure 1C).
This finding demonstrates that GPVI signaling efficiently induces
MLC phosphorylation via the Ca2/MLC kinase pathway independently
of RhoA, as shown for human platelets.41 Conversely, these
results emphasize that fibrous collagen (and to a lesser extent CRP)
are largely dependent on generated TxA
2
for induction of shape
change under conditions as present in the aggregometry cuvette.6,29
Besides shape change, our results using RhoA/ and G
13
/
platelets reveal an important role of RhoA for secretion of and
dense granules by G
13
but to a lesser extent also by G
q
signaling
(Figure 3 and supplemental Figures 2B and 3A), in agreement with
previous indirect studies.6,9,40,42 Little is known about how Rho
GTPases mechanistically facilitate exocytosis (reviewed in Ory
and Gasman43). In platelets, cytoskeletal rearrangements are known
to be critical for degranulation,44 and observations in different cell
types indicated that RhoA associates to secretory granules and
proteins of the exocyst complex.43 However, these studies suggested
an inhibitory rather than activatory role for the GTPase
during exocytosis. Thus, the exact mechanisms by which RhoA
participates in platelet granule release remain to be determined.
Likewise, the mechanism by which RhoA contributes to
G
q
-mediated platelet activation requires further investigation. Notably
, RhoA was not involved in the classic signaling cascade
downstream of G
q
in platelets leading to PLC activation, Ca2
mobilization, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (supplemental
Figure 3B-C). This indicates that G
q
may directly regulate RhoA
activity by activating Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factors,
such as LARG, as indicated by indirect studies.40,45
RhoA has been shown to regulate inside-out activation, as well
as outside-in signaling of the main integrin IIb3 in platelets.9,29,46We show that RhoAdeficiency results in partially reduced
platelet integrin activation (Figure 3). Thus, RhoA may to some
part contribute to inside-out activation of integrin IIb3 in 
platelets, although it is unlikely that the mild defect significantly
affected in vitro and in vivo function of the mutant platelets. In
contrast, RhoA/ platelets displayed discrete defects in integrin
outside-in signaling. RhoA was clearly dispensable for platelet
spreading on fibrinogen after activation (Figure 4A and supplemental
Figure 4A) but essential for clot retraction (Figure 4C). These
observations stand in contrast to a previous study using C3
exoenzyme,15 but they reflect recent findings by Gong et al.18
Importantly, however, we also found that G
13
-deficient platelets
spread normally on fibrinogen after activation, demonstrating that
the underlying mechanisms are more complex than assumed in that
study (supplemental Figure 4E).
Although modulation of actinomyosin is thought to be one
major event of RhoA signaling,2 our data indicate that RhoA is not
required for F-actin assembly and that its deficiency only moderately
affects stress fiber formation in platelets (Figure 4B and
supplemental Figure 4C-D). These results are in agreement with
findings made in recently generated RhoA-deficient keratinocytes20
and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.47In the latter studies, unchanged
actomyosin regulation may be explained by a functional redundancy
of RhoAwith RhoB and RhoC. In contrast, RhoAwas shown
to be the only Rho isoform expressed in platelets.47 However,
redundancies of RhoA and other GTPases may exist in platelets.
Cdc42 and RhoF represent potential candidates in this context
because they share the downstream effector mDia with RhoA.19,49,50
Interestingly, RhoA deficiency affected the structure of microtubules
in spread platelets (Figure 4B). This finding indicates that
RhoA may be involved in microtubule reorganization after platelet
activation, as suggested in a study indicating a role for RhoA/ROCK-
mediated regulation of microtubules during platelet shape change.51
Besides ROCK, RhoA also may regulate microtubules via mDia, as
shown for other cell types.3
Our flow adhesion experiments indicated that RhoA deficiency
may selectively affect platelet function at very high shear rates
(Figure 5 and supplemental Figure 5C). Notably, the increased
rolling velocity of the mutant platelets on immobilized VWF under
these in vitro conditions also may partially be explained by their
increased size. Importantly, however, RhoA deficiency resulted in
protection from arterial thrombosis in 2 different injury models
(Figures 5 and 6), and this phenotype was neither caused by the
decreased platelet counts nor by the increase in platelet size in these
animals (Figure 1B and supplemental Figure 5D). These results
indicate that the observed protection is caused by the loss of RhoA
function and that signaling of the GTPase is critical for the
stabilization of formed thrombi in vivo. Remarkably, RhoA/
mice were also significantly protected from neuronal damage in the
tMCAO model of ischemic stroke, which is known to be strictly
dependent on GPIb and VWF but not integrinIIb3-dependent
aggregation.35-37 Interestingly, this protection was not associated
with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, although
the mutant mice displayed severely prolonged tail bleeding times
caused by frequent rebleeding (Figure 6D), a phenotype that is
similar to that seen in mice treated with GPIb-blocking antibodies.35
Little is known about the potential association of RhoA deregulation
in human hematologic diseases. Previously, RhoA was implicated as an
upstream regulator of the gene encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain
(Myh9) in indirect studies.38 Interestingly, the phenotype of RhoA
deficiency in mice in many aspects mirrors the clinical manifestation of
patients carrying mutations in the Myh9 gene. Like RhoA-deficient
mice, patients with Myh9-related disorders suffer from macrothrombocytopenia
and a mild bleeding diathesis. The residual platelets display a
shape change defect and are unable to facilitate clot retraction (reviewed
in Althaus and Greinacher52). Thus, our study provides direct evidence
for the importance of RhoA signaling leading to Myh9 activation and
thus to the development of this complex disease. It is unlikely that
loss-of-function mutations of RhoA exist in humans as the GTPase is
ubiquitously expressed and its dysfunction would most probably lead to
embryonic lethality. However, further studies are required to assess how

a potential involvement of altered RhoA regulation or activity may
contribute to defects in platelet biogenesis and function in humans.
Taken together, our studies reveal distinct signaling defects in RhoA/
platelets that have a major impact on hemostasis and thrombotic
diseases.
