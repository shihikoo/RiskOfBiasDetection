Abstract
Prothymosin alpha (ProTa), a nuclear protein, is implicated in
the inhibition of ischemia-induced necrosis as well as apoptosis
in the brain and retina. Although ProTa has multiple
biological functions through distinct regions in its sequence, it
has remained which region is involved in this neuroprotection.
This study reported that the active core peptide sequence P
30
(amino acids 49–78) of ProTa exerts its full survival effect in
cultured cortical neurons against ischemic stress. Our in vivo
study revealed that intravitreous administration of P
30
at 24 h
after retinal ischemia significantly blocks the ischemia-induced
functional damages of retina at day 7. In addition, P
30
completely rescued the retinal ischemia-induced ganglion cell
damages at day 7 after the ischemic stress, along with partial
blockade of the loss of bipolar, amacrine, and photoreceptor
cells. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular (3 nmol) or
systemic (1 mg/kg; i.v.) injection of P
30
at 1 h after cerebral
ischemia (1 h tMCAO) significantly blocked the ischemiainduced
brain damages and disruption of blood vessels.
Systemic P30 delivery (1 mg/kg; i.v.) also significantly ameliorated
the ischemic brain caused by photochemically induced
thrombosis. Taken together, this study confers a precise
demonstration about the novel protective activity of ProTaderived
small peptide P
30
against the ischemic damages
in vitro and in vivo.

Ischemic damages in the central nervous system including
brain and retina are associated with the rapid and severe loss
of functional and cellular responses through the mechanisms
of necrosis as well as apoptosis by several types of cytotoxic
mediators (White et al. 2000; Paolucci et al.2003; Ueda and
Fujita 2004; Feigin 2005; Flynn et al. 2008; Fornage 2009;
Dvoriantchikova et al. 2010; Neroev et al. 2010; Sims and
Muyderman 2010; Yin et al. 2010; Iadecola and Anrather
2011; Witmer et al. 2011). At the same time, several
neuroprotective molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and
erythropoietin (EPO) are produced upon ischemia to play
limited attenuation of ischemic damages through the antiapoptosis
mechanisms, without exerting protective activity
against necrosis (Siren et al. 2001; Korada et al. 2002;
Maiese et al. 2004; Blanco et al. 2008; Fujita et al. 2009;
Madinier et al. 2009; Ueda et al. 2010; Bejot et al. 2011).
Prothymosin alpha (ProTa) has been identified in the
conditioned medium of serum-free primary culture of cortical
neurons, as an anti-necrosis factor (Ueda et al. 2007). In
addition, ProTa potently inhibits the ischemia-induced
damages in brain and retina (Fujita and Ueda 2007; Fujita
et al. 2009; Ueda et al. 2010). It is interesting that ProTa

has distinct actions, which are all related to the cell survival
(Jiang et al. 2003; Ueda 2008; Mosoian et al. 2010; Ueda
et al. 2012). Some studies revealed that different peptide
sequences in ProTa are implicated with these survival
actions. The peptide sequence in the central domain of ProTa
(amino acids; a.a. 32–52) is related to the interaction with
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which play
roles in the induction of oxidative stress-protecting genes
expression by liberating Nrf2 from the Nrf2-Keap1 inhibitory
complex (Karapetian et al. 2005). The N-terminal sequence
in ProTa (a.a. 2–29), corresponding to thymosin alpha 1,
which has an ability to induce anti-cancer effects (Garaci
et al.2007; Danielli et al.2012). In addition, thymosin alpha
1 has been approved in 35 countries for the treatment of
hepatitis B and C, and as an immune stimulant and adjuvant
(Goldstein and Goldstein 2009; Pierluigi et al. 2010).
Previous reports suggested that C-terminal region (a.a. 89–
109, 99–109 and 100–109) of human ProTa exerts immunoenhancing
effects including pro-inflammatory activity
through the stimulation of monocytes via toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling, induces dendritic cell maturation and adopts
b-sheet conformation (Skopeliti et al. 2009). Most recently,
there is a report about the survival activity of the middle part
(a.a. 41–83) of human ProTa against mutant huntingtoncaused
cytotoxicity in the cultured cells (Dong et al. 2012).
However, it remains to be elucidated which region is
responsible for the neuroprotection against ischemia-induced
neuronal damages. In this study, we have attempted to see
the neuroprotective activity of ProTa-derived small peptide
against ischemic damages in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57/BLJ mice weighing 20–25 g were purchased from
Tagawa Experimental Animals (Nagasaki, Japan) and used for all
the experiments. Mice were kept in a room maintained at constant
temperature (21  2°C) and relative humidity (55 5%) with an
automatic 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to standard
laboratory diet and tap water. Animal care and all experimental
procedures were formally approved by Nagasaki University Animal
Care and Use Committee (Animal Experiments Approval Number:
1104190914).
Expression constructs and purification procedures for GST-fusion
rat ProTa deletion mutants
The rat ProTa gene was amplified from cDNA derived from rat
embryonic brain. The gene constructions for expression of
recombinant GST-ProTa deletion mutants (Full-length, ∆1-29,
∆1-48, ∆1-68, ∆1-86, ∆30-112, ∆58-112, ∆79-112, and ∆102-112)
were previously described (Ueda et al. 2007; Matsunaga and Ueda
2010). Here, we newly made a GST-ProTa-49-78. The amplified
genes blunted at their 5′-ends and cloned in-frame into the BamHI
(blunted)-EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science
Corp, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The PCR primers used were as
follows: ∆1-48-F, 5′-AGGGATCCAATGGCTGACAATGAGGT
AGATG-3′ and ∆79-112-R, 5′-TTGAATTCCTAATCTCCATC
TTCTTCCTC-3′. F-primer contains a BamHI site, while all
R-primer contains a stop codon and an EcoRI site. The recombinant
proteins were purified using Glutathione-SepharoseTM (GE Healthcare
Bio-Science Corp).
Identification of functional active core domain in ProTa
To determine the active core domain in ProTa, we measured the
survival activity in primary cultured rat cortical neurons. The
preparation and culture of cortical neurons were previously described
(Uedaet al.2007). The culture of neurons was started at low density
(19 105 cells/cm2) under the serum-free conditions in the presence
or absence of GST and GST-ProTadeletion mutants (100 nM). After
12 h from the start of culture, survival activity was evaluated by
WST-8 reduction activity (Cell Counting Kit-8; DOJINDO,
Kumamoto, Japan). Finally, we successfully obtained the functional
active core domain comprised of 30 amino acids in ProTa (a.a. 49–
78) and referred as P
30
according to number of amino acids.
Peptide administration
Intravitreal injection was performed using a 33-gauge needle
connected to a microsyringe and the needle was inserted approximately
1 mm behind the corneal limbus, guided under a stereoscopic
microscope to avoid lens and retinal injury. Peptide P
30
was
dissolved in 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was diluted
with 0.1 M potassium-free phosphate buffered saline (K+-free PBS).
P
30
was injected intravitreously (i.vt.) in the eye with doses of 1, 3
and 10 pmol/lL at 24 h after retinal ischemia (n = 5, n = 6 and
n = 7, respectively). Vehicle was treated with equal volume of
0.05% DMSO in a similar manner. On the other hand, P
30
was
injected intracerebroventricularly (0.03 and 3 nmol/5 lL, i.c.v.;
n = 6 and n = 7, respectively) in the brain at 1 h after cerebral
ischemia (1 h tMCAO). P
30
(0.3 and 1 mg/kg) was administered
intravenously (i.v.) at 1 h after cerebral ischemia. In addition, P
30
was delivered (1 mg/kg, i.v.) at 3 and 6 h after the cerebral ischemic
stress.
Retinal ischemia
Retinal ischemia was performed following the method as described
previously (Fujita et al. 2009). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with
an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/
kg) and pupils were fully dilated with 1% atropine sulfate drops
(Nitten, Nagoya, Japan). The anterior chamber of the eye was
cannulated with a 33-gauge needle attached to an infusion container
of sterile intraocular irrigating solution (BSS PLUS dilution buffer;
Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). Retinal ischemia was induced by
elevating the IOP to generate a hydrostatic pressure of 130 mm Hg
for 45 min by lifting the container. Following 45 min after retinal
ischemic stress, the needle was withdrawn and 0.3% ofloxacin
(Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied
topically into the eye to avoid infection.
Electroretinogram
Electroretinogram (ERG) study was performed following the
protocol as previously described (Fujita et al. 2009). Briefly, mice
were dark-adapted for 3–4 h, then anesthetized with intraperitoneal
injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and pupils were

dilated with 1% atropine. A contact electrode (KE–S; Kyoto contact
lenses, Kyoto, Japan) was placed topically on the corneal apex and
reference electrode was placed near the ipsilateral eye. The ground
was a subdermal platinum needle electrode near the abdominal area.
ERGs were produced by 20 J flash intensities. The flash stimulus
source (SLS-3100; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) illuminated the
eye by diffuse reflection off the interior surface of the ganzfeld.
Maximum flash luminance was measured with detector (MEB–
9104; Nihon Kohden). After the intensity series, an incandescent
background light sufficient to desensitize the rod system was turned
on, and ERGs produced by the standard stimulus were recorded
every 2 min for 20 min. The background was then turned off, and
ERGs were produced by the standard stimulus every 2 min for the
first 30 min of dark adaptation. The a- and b-wave amplitudes were
measured online (Neuropack m, QP-903B; Nihon Kohden). ERG
was performed at day 7 after retinal ischemia.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
The transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model was
induced following the method as described previously (Halder et al.
2012). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane (Mylan,
Tokyo, Japan), and body temperature was monitored and maintained
at 37°C during surgery. After a midline neck incision, the middle
cerebral artery was occluded transiently using 8-0 in size monofilament
nylon surgical suture (Natsume Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
coated with silicon (Xantopren, Bayer dental, Osaka, Japan) that
was inserted through the left common carotid artery and advanced
into the left internal carotid artery. Following 1 h tMCAO, the
animals were briefly re-anesthetized with isoflurane and the
monofilament was withdrawn for reperfusion studies. Cerebral
blood flow was monitored by laser Doppler flowmeter (ALF21;
Advance Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a probe (diameter 0.5 mm) of a
laser Doppler flowmeter (ALF2100; Advance Co.) inserted into the
left striatum (anterior: 0.5 mm, lateral: 1.8 mm from bregma;
depth: 4.2 mm from the skull surface) through a guide cannula.
Photochemically induced middle cerebral artery thrombosis
Photochemically induced thrombosis (PIT) was produced following
the protocol as described previously (Nagai et al. 2007). Briefly,
anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane, and the rectal temperature
was maintained at 37°C. The temporal muscle was dissected,
the skull was exposed, and a 1.5-mm opening was made over the
middle cerebral artery (MCA). Photo-illumination of green light
(wavelength: 540 nm) was achieved with a xenon lamp (model
L-4887, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) with heatabsorbing
and green filters, via an optic fiber with a focus of 1 mm,
placed on the opening in the skull. Rose Bengal (Wako, Osaka,
Japan) was injected (3 mg/kg, i.v.) in mice, and photo-illumination
(5000 lx) was applied for 10 min, after which the temporal muscle
and skin were replaced. The MCA occlusion time (from the start of
light exposure until the flow in the MCA is stopped) was monitored
by observation in real time under the microscope.
Retinal and brain tissue preparation
For retinal tissue preparation, mice were deeply anaesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.). Eye was quickly isolated,
washed with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Eye was then
nicked through pupil, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and finally
transferred to 25% sucrose solution (in 0.1 M K+-free PBS)
overnight for cryoprotection. Following frozen in cryoembedding
compound, retinal sections were prepared at 10 lm thickness. For
brain tissue preparation, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with
0.1 M PBS, followed by 4% PFA. Brain was then quickly removed,
post-fixed in 4% PFA and transferred immediately to 25% sucrose
solution overnight. Brain was frozen in cryoembedding compound
and coronal sections were cut at 30 lm thickness for immunohistochemical
analysis.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining
For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, frozen retinal sections
were washed with 0.1 M K+-free PBS, immerged in Mayer`s
hematoxylin solution (Wako) for 5 min at 25C and then washed
with tap water for 20 min. Following brief treatment with 95%
ethanol, sections were immerged in eosin-alcohol solution (Wako)
for 4 min at 25C. Sections were dehydrated through a series of
ethanol solutions, xylene, and over-slipped with Permount (Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Sections were then analyzed using
a BZ-8000 microscope with BZ Image Measurement Software
(KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan).
Immunohistochemical analysis
To perform fluorescence immunohistochemistry, retinal sections
were washed with 0.1 M K+-free PBS and incubated with 50%
methanol followed by 100% methanol for 10 min. Following
treatment with blocking buffers [bovine serum albumin (BSA) as
well as 10% goat serum with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate
buffered saline (PBST)], retinal sections were incubated overnight at
4°C with following primary antibodies: anti-NeuN (1 : 100; mouse
monoclonal IgG
1
, clone A60; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA);
anti-syntaxin-1 (1 : 500; mouse monoclonal; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA); and anti-Chx10 (1 : 300; sheep polyclonal;
Exalpha Biologicals Inc., MA, USA). Sections were then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated anti-sheep IgG secondary antibodies (1 : 300;
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The nuclei were visualized
with Hoechst 33342 (1 : 10 000; Molecular Probes). Samples were
then washed thoroughly with PBS and cover-slipped with Perma
Fluor (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Images were
collected using a BZ-8000 microscope with BZ Image Measurement
Software.
For blood vessels staining, biotinylated Lycopersicon esculentum
(tomato) lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) is
diluted with PBS. Biotinylated tomato lectin was injected (1 mg/
mL, 100 lL, i.v.) at 24 h after cerebral ischemia (1 h tMCAO).
Mice were perfused 5 min after tomato lectin injection. Following
tissue preparation as described in the method section, coronal brain
section was blocked with 2% BSA in 0.1% PBST for 2 h, and then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin conjugates for 2 h at
25C. Sections were washed with PBS and cover-slipped with
Perma Fluor. Images were collected using an LSM 710 confocal
microscope with ZEN Software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
TTC staining
For 2,3,5–triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, brain was

followed by P
30
administration (n = 7), sectioned coronally with a
1-mm thickness and washed with K+-free PBS. Brain slices were
incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.9% NaCl in dark
place for 15–20 min at 25C and transferred in 4% PFA
overnight. Images of brain slices were then collected by scanner,
and infarct volume was calculated by Image J software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA).
Behavioral assessments
Following P
30
administration with doses of 0.03 and 3 nmol/5 lL
(i.c.v., n = 6 and n = 7, respectively), 0.3 and 1 mg/kg (i.v., n = 5
and n = 7, respectively) at 1 h as well as 1 mg/kg (i.v.) at 3 and 6 h
(n = 5 and n = 7, respectively) after cerebral ischemia (1 h
tMCAO), behavioral studies were assessed through 14 days.
Clinical score was evaluated from day 1 after ischemia in the
following way: 0, no observable deficits; 1, failure to extend the
forepaw fully; 2, circling; 3, falling to one side; 4, no spontaneous
movement; 5, death. In this study, 0.5 point was added to each score
when the motor dysfunction was severe for scores between 1 and 4.
Survival rate was evaluated from day 1 after tMCAO and calculated
by the percentage of vehicle or P
30
post-treated mice that were alive
through 14 days after ischemia.
Statistical analysis
All results are shown as means  SEM. Two independent groups
were compared using the Student’s t-test. Multiple groups were
compared using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test after a onefactor ANOVA or a repeated measure ANOVA. Survival rate was
compared using Logrank test after Kaplan–Meyer method. p < 0.05
was considered significant.
Results
Characterization of functionally active core peptide in ProTa
The functionally active core domain in rat recombinant
ProTa was determined by measuring the survival activity of
cultured cortical neurons in the presence of different deletion
mutants of GST-fusion ProTa at 12 h after the ischemic
(serum-free) stress (Fig. 1a–c). Thefindings revealed that the
N-terminal deletion mutants ProTa (∆1–29 and ∆1–48) as
well as C-terminal deletion mutants ProTa (∆79–112 and
∆102–112) elicit its protective effect as like as full-length
ProTa against ischemic stress-induced cultured neuronal
damages (Fig. 1b, c). However, the deletion mutants of
ProTa devoid of central peptide sequence comprised of 30
amino acids (P
30
: a.a. 49–78) abolished its neuroprotective
activity against the ischemic stress (Fig. 1b, c). Interestingly,
the core peptide sequence P
30
(a.a. 49–78) itself exerted the
full survival effect in cultured neurons against ischemic
damages, an indication of neuroprotective characteristics of
ProTa-derived peptide P
30
(Fig. 1b, c).
Blockade of retinal ischemia-induced damages by
ProTa-derived peptides
We reported previously that ProTa inhibits the retinal
ischemia-induced functional and cellular damages (Fujita
et al. 2009). To evaluate whether ProTa-derived peptide has
protective activity against ischemic damages in vivo,P

ipsilateral eye at 24 h after retinal ischemia. The hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining data showed that the number of
cells in different retinal layers as well as the retinal thickness
is significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated mice at day 7
after the ischemic stress, whereas 10 pmol P
30
maximally
and significantly inhibited this cellular loss in retina and
decrease in retinal thickness at day 7 (Fig. 2a, b).
In electroretinogram (ERG), the amplitude called a-wave
represents the functional activity of photoreceptor cells,
whereas b-wave indicates the functions of mixture of cells
including bipolar, Muller, amacrine, and ganglion cells (Asi
and Perlman 1992; Fujita et al.2009). Following after retinal
ischemia and reperfusion, the ERGs analysis showed that
a- and b-wave amplitudes are significantly decreased in the
vehicle-treated mice at day 7 after retinal ischemia, compared
with the control (Fig. 2c, d). Following P
30
treatment,
dose-dependent increase in a- and b-wave amplitudes were
observed at day 7 after the retinal ischemic stress, and
10 pmol P
30
exerted its maximum protective effect against
the ischemic damages (Fig. 2c, d). On the other hand, no
significant protective effect of thymosin alpha 1 (a.a. 2–29)
corresponding to N-terminal sequence of ProTa and the
C-terminal peptide (a.a. 102–112) against retinal ischemic
damages were observed at day 7 after ischemia (data are not
shown).

To examine the cell type-specific protective activity of
ProTa-derived peptide in ischemic retina, P
30
was injected
(10 pmol/lL, i.vt.) in the ipsilateral eye at 24 h after retinal
ischemia. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that
NeuN-positive neurons (Buckingham et al. 2008) in the
ganglion cell layer (GCL) are significantly diminished at
day 7 after retinal ischemic stress, compared to the control
(Fig. 3a). Following P

cells was observed in the GCL of ischemic retina at day 7
after the ischemic stress (Fig. 3a). On the other hand,
treatment of P

partially, but significantly blocked the loss
of Chx10-positive bipolar cells (Rhee et al. 2007) in the
inner nuclear layer (INL) (Fig. 3b), syntaxin-1-positive
amacrine cells (Sherry et al. 2006), of which the cell bodies
and processes are located in the INL and inner plexiform
layer (IPL), respectively (Fig. 3c), and photo-receptor cells
in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (Fig. 3d), compared with
the respective controls and vehicles.
Inhibition of cerebral ischemia-induced brain damages by
P

To evaluate the protective activity of P
30
against ischemic
brain damages, mice were post-treated with P
30
in time- and
dose-dependent manner following different routes of administration
, and subsequent 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining at 24 h and behavioral assessments through
14 days were performed after cerebral ischemia (1 h
tMCAO). The TTC staining data showed that the infarct
volume is significantly decreased at 24 h in the ischemic
brain by intracerebroventicular (i.c.v.) injection of 3 nmol
P
30
at 1 h after tMCAO (Fig. 4a, b), but not by 0.03 nmol
(data are not shown). We also observed that the clinical score
is significantly decreased at day 1 after 1 h tMCAO in mice
injected with 3 nmol P
30
(i.c.v.) at 1 h after the ischemic
stress (Fig. 4c). In addition, significant decrease in clinical
score and increase in survival rate were observed through
14 days after i.c.v. delivery (1 h after ischemia) of 3 nmol
P
30
, an indication of long-lasting protective effect of P
30
against ischemic brain damages (Fig. 4d, e).
On the other hand, P
30
was injected intravenously (i.v.)
with doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg at 1 h after cerebral ischemia
(1 h tMCAO). Our TTC staining data revealed that the
infarct volume is significantly decreased at 24 h in the
ischemic brain treated with 1 mg/kg of P
30
treatment at

7 days and survival rate was maximally increased through
14 days after tMCAO, compared with the vehicle and
ischemic mice treated with 0.3 mg/kg of P
30
(Fig. 4h–j).
The behavioral study also confirmed that systemic (i.v.) P
30
delivery with the dose of 1 mg/kg at 1 h after ischemia
induces it maximum protective effect at day 7 against the
ischemic brain damages, compared to P
30
treatment at 3 or

P
30
inhibits the cerebral ischemia-induced blood vessel
damages
In the ischemic stroke and cerebrovascular disease, vascular
defect is occurred along with neuronal damages (Paul et al.
2001; Fujita and Ueda 2007). To investigate whether P
30
protects the ischemia-induced blood vessels damages, P
30
was injected (1 mg/kg; i.v.) at 1 h after cerebral ischemia
(1 h tMCAO). Following blood vessel immunostaining using
biotinylated tomato lectin and Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin
at 24 h after ischemia, the findings revealed that the number

blood vessels are markedly decreased in somatosensory
cortex in the brain of vehicle-treated mice, compared with the
control (Fig. 5a, b). In addition, the decrease in lengths of the
blood vessels was observed at 24 h after tMCAO (Fig. 5a,
c). This ischemia-induced loss of tomato lectin-stained blood
vessels in terms of number and lengths was completely
recovered in the somatosensory cortex at 24 h after the
ischemic stress in mice post-treated with P
30
, but the lengths
were relatively larger than the vessels in the control brain, an
indication of the protective role of P
30
against ischemiainduced
blood vessel damages (Fig. 5a–c). Similar results of
the recovery of cerebral ischemia-induced blood vessels
damages by P
30
were observed in the striatum and hippocampus
at 24 h after 1 h tMCAO (data are not shown).
P
30
ameliorates the ischemic brain caused by
photochemically induced thrombosis
It is well known that ischemic model because of middle
cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion with photochemically
induced thrombosis (PIT) is analogous to clinical condition
(Tanaka et al. 2007). In this ischemic mouse model, there
was a significant behavioral damage evaluated by clinical
score (Fig. 6a). This damage was significantly attenuated by
systemic post-treatment with P
30
(1 mg/kg, i.v.) at 1 h after
PIT (Fig. 6a). Following behavioral study after PIT stress,
neurological assessments using TTC staining were performed
at 24 h. The TTC staining data revealed that there was a
marked increase in cerebral infarction observed at 24 h after
PIT in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6b), but this cerebral brain
damage in terms of infarct volume and hemisphere expansion
was significantly inhibited by systemic treatment of P
30
(Fig. 6c, d).
Discussion
This study demonstrates three major findings. First, active
core peptide domain P
30
(a.a. 49–78) derived from ProTa
retains the original survival activity in cultured neuronal cells
against ischemic (serum-free) stress. Second, characterizations
of P
30
actions reveal that it potently inhibits the
ischemia-induced damages in retina and brain. Third, P

Following administration with biotinylated tomato lectin (1 mg/mL,

subsequent perfusion 5 min after biotinylated tomato lectin injection,
immunostaining of blood vessels by Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin (a) as
well as measurement of number (b) and length (c) of blood vessels is
performed at day 1 after the ischemic stress. Data represent the

induces protective action against ischemia-induced disruption
of cerebral blood vessels.
Several in vitro studies reported about the different
sequence-specific functions of ProTa, which is also involved
in the mechanisms of cell survival (Jiang et al. 2003;
Karapetian et al. 2005; Skopeliti et al. 2007; Ueda et al.
2007; Ueda 2009; Mosoian et al. 2010; Danielli et al. 2012;
Dong et al. 2012). On the basis of previous information, we
firstly designed in vitro experiments tofind out the sequencespecific neuroprotective actions of ProTa using various
deletion mutants of GST-ProTa in neuronal cells culture
under ischemic stress. The peptides lacking sequence (a.a. 1–
29), which belongs to thymosin alpha 1 (a.a. 2–29), sequence
(a.a. 1–48), which mostly covers the binding region for
Keap1, or C-terminal sequences (a.a. 79–112 and 102–112)
completely retained the original survival activity as like
ProTa. However, the significant decrease in survival effect
was observed by the deficiency of parts of the central core
peptide sequence comprised of 30 amino acids in ProTa (a.a.
49–78). Interestingly, this central active core peptide of
ProTa referred as P30
(a.a. 49–78) itself exerts full survival
action in neuronal cells against ischemia. Retinal ischemia
causes the functional and cellular damages in different layers
of retina through several destructive cascade of mechanisms,
as consequence of visual impairment and blindness (Osborne
et al. 2004). Our recent in vivo studies suggested that ProTa
potently inhibits this ischemia-induced functional and cellular
damages of retina (Fujita et al. 2009; Ueda et al. 2010).
To evaluate the in vivo protective effect of P
30
against
ischemic damages, ischemic retina was post-treated with P
30
.
The findings using H&E staining and ERG study revealed
that P
30
significantly blocks the retinal ischemia-induced
decrease in cells number of different layers and retinal
thickness. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis clarified that P
30
completely rescues the retinal ischemia-induced
ganglion cell damages, along with the partial but significant
blockade of the loss of bipolar, amacrine, and photoreceptor
cells. Stroke following cerebral ischemia (tMCAO) or
photothrombotic brain ischemia causes the neuronal damages
, along with adequate disruption of cerebral blood
vessels (Beck and Plate 2009; Hofmeijer and van Putten
2012; Krysl et al. 2012). We previously explained the
protective role of ProTa against cerebral ischemia-induced
brain damages (Fujita and Ueda 2007; Ueda 2009; Ueda
et al. 2010). The present findings of TTC staining and
neurological assessment suggested that intracerebroventicular
(3 nmol, i.c.v.) or systemic (1 mg/kg, i.v.) treatment with
P
30
at 1 h after cerebral ischemia (1 h tMCAO) significantly
blocks ischemia-induced brain damages. Following immunostaining
with tomato lectin in P
30
-treated (1 mg/kg, i.v.)
ischemic mice, the complete recovery of ischemia-induced
(tMCAO) cerebral blood vessels damages was observed
through day 1, a consideration of P
30
as a new angiogenic
factor. In addition, systemic administration with P
30
(1 mg/
kg, i.v.) significantly ameliorated the ischemic brain caused
by photochemically induced thrombosis (PIT), a representative
clinical model of cerebral ischemia.
The present investigations were performed following
several routes of the administration of P
30
. According to
the fact that retinal ischemia possesses high reproducibility
and quantitation to understand the pathophysiological
changes and signaling pathways under ischemic condition
(Prasad et al. 2010), we used this ischemic injury as a simple
model for screening of survival activity by i.vt. administration
of P
30
. We already reported that i.v. administration with
full-length ProTa induces protective effect against retinal
ischemia (Fujita et al. 2009). In brain ischemia, we firstly
decided to perform i.c.v. administration of P
30
to evaluate the
improvement of ischemic injury, and successfully confirmed
against ischemic brain damages. Our recent studies revealed
that myc-tagged ProTa (1 mg/kg) is penetrated to the
damaged area of brain at least 3 h after brain ischemia by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, and that systemic administration
(i.p. and i.v.) of ProTa ameliorates brain ischemiainduced
functional and cellular damages (Fujita and Ueda
2007). It is well known that brain ischemic stress disrupts the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Paul et al.2001; Fujita and Ueda
2007). Thus, we presume that like ProTa, systemic administrated
P
30
would penetrate to the damaged brain through the
disrupted BBB. Although relationship between route of
administration and penetrated amounts of P
30
to the brain are
not clear, isotope and/or fluorescence labeling might be
useful method for the calculation of penetration. In the
systemic administration, ProTa and P
30
exercise the
maximum improvement effect against brain ischemia in
100 lg/kg (equivalent 8.08 nmoles/kg) and 1 mg/kg (equivalent
0.30 lmoles/kg), respectively. This difference of
efficacy between ProTa and P
30
might be because of the
stability of P
30
in vivo, though GST-ProTaand GST-P
30
(a.a.
49–78) showed similar survival activity in this in vitro study.
However, the modification of amino acid and/or mutation in
sequence of P
30
may provide a better solution to improve the
stability and survival activity of P
30
. This should be the next
issue to address.
Cortical neurons in serum-free primary culture rapidly die
by necrosis, which is completely inhibited by ProTa (Fujita
and Ueda 2003; Ueda et al. 2007). As ProTa also protects
the retinal ischemia-induced necrosis and apoptosis through
the up-regulation of BDNF and EPO, and this retinal
protection is completely abolished by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
or antibody treatment against ProTa
(Fujita et al. 2009; Ueda et al. 2010), it should be an
interesting next subject to investigate whether the same
mechanisms are involved in the P
30
-induced functional and
cellular protection against ischemic damages. Despite of
being neuroprotective activity of several proteins, peptides
have been detected as a new class of attractable therapeutic
molecule owing to their diversity, synthesis, and higher

capability to penetrate the challenging targets (Archakov
et al. 2003; Watt 2006; Gozes 2007; Patel et al. 2007;
Meade et al. 2009). Taken together, this study confers a
precise demonstration about the broad-spectrum protective
activity of ProTa-derived small peptide P
30
against ischemic
damages in vitro and in vivo. Thus, it is evident that P
30
mimics the in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective actions of
ProTa. The sequence homology of P
30
domain in ProTa
among all species is highly conserved; furthermore, this
sequence is completely equal in human, rat, and mouse.
From these facts, it is speculated that P
30
domain may plays
important roles in robustness of ProTa against neuronal
damages.
In conclusion, ProTa-derived peptide P
30
exerted its
survival actions in cultured neurons against ischemic stress.
P
30
significantly blocked the ischemia-induced functional
and cellular damages in retina as well as in brain, along with
inhibition of the cerebral blood vessels disruption. Therefore,
detailed mechanisms underlying neuroprotection by ProTaderived
small peptide may provide a novel therapeutic
approach for the treatment of ischemic damages in the central
nervous system.
