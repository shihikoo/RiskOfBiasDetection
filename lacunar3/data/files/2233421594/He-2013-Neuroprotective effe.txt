Although systemic hypothermia provides favorable outcomes in stroke patients, it has only
been adopted in a limited number of patients because of fatal complications. To resolve
these issues, focal brain cooling (FBC) has recently drawn attention as a less-invasive
treatment for brain injuries. Therefore, we investigated whether FBC has a favorable effect
on focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Male-adult-Wistar rats were used. Under general
anesthesia, a small burr hole was made and FCI was induced in the primary sensorimotor
area (SI-MI) using photothrombosis. An additional craniotomy was made over the SI-MI
and FBC was performed at a temperature of 15 1C for 5 h. Electrocorticograms (ECoG) were
recorded on the border cortex of the ischemic focus. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed and
the infarct area was measured. In another experiment, rats were allowed to recover for 5
days after cooling and neurobehavioral function was evaluated. FBC suppressed all ECoG
frequency bands during and after cooling (po0.05), except for the delta frequency band in
the precooling versus rewarming periods. The injured areas in the cooling and non-cooling
groups were 0.9970.30 and 1.7170.54 mm2, respectively (po0.03). The grip strength at 2
days after surgery was preserved in the cooling group (po0.05). We report the novel finding
that epileptiform discharges were suppressed in the ischemic border, the infarct area was
reduced and neurobehaviour was preserved by FBC. These results indicate that FBC is
neuroprotective in the ischemic brain and has demonstrated therapeutic potential for
cerebral infarction.

1. Introduction
Several experimental studies have indicated that a decrease in
brain temperature reduces cerebral infarction and is neuroprotective
to the brain, while a mild increase in brain temperature
can exacerbate the extent of ischemic neural injury (Busto
et al., 1987; Minamisawa et al., 1990; Ginsberg et al., 1992; Kim
et al., 1996; Baena et al., 1997). Therefore, previous studies have
emphasized the clinical feasibility of systemic hypothermia for
patients with brain injury and ischemia (Ginsberg et al., 1992;
Clifton et al., 1993; Baena et al., 1997; Yanamoto et al., 1996;
Schwab et al., 2001). Despite these favorable outcomes,
systemic hypothermia can also lead to fatal complications, such
as infection, cardiac arrhythmia, and disruption of blood coagulation
(Clifton et al., 1993; Marion et al., 1993; Schubert, 1995).
To resolve these issues, focal brain cooling (FBC) has recently
drawn attention as a minimally invasive treatment for brain
injuries (Oku et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007;
Clark et al., 2009). Compared with systemic hypothermia, FBC
has the advantage of reducing the cooling temperature below
30 1C, without producing permanent brain damage or systemic
complications (Yang et al., 2006). The initial clinical application
of FBC was performed for patients with brain tumor or epilepsy
from 1959 to the early 1960s and its effectiveness was demonstrated
(FAY T, 1959;Ommaya and Baldwin, 1963). Despite these
initial studies supporting the therapeutic potential of FBC, FBC
has not been optimized for clinical use. However, in the 21st
century, FBC has received much attention for the treatment of
severe brain injuries, as described above, along with advancements
in medical engineering technology. Our recent experimental
studies have also indicated the effectiveness of FBC
against focal epilepsy and nociceptive pain (Imoto et al., 2006;
Tanaka et al., 2008; Fujioka et al., 2010a).
Under these circumstances, the aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of FBC on focal cerebral ischemia. We
employed a photothrombotic model of focal cerebral ischemia
because photothrombotic occlusion of cerebral microvessels
using Rose Bengal dye is a highly-reproducible and a
less-invasive method of simulating the ischemic infarct
pattern in humans (Yao et al., 2003; Grome et al., 1988).
Furthermore, in acute focal ischemia, high extracellular
potassium and excess glutamate release from the ischemic core
leads to depolarization and increased metabolic demand on the
neighboring cortex. These conditions can induce periodic epileptiform
discharges (EDs) along the ischemic border (Hartings
et al., 2003; Iijima et al., 1992). These repetitive EDs could play a
key role in the progression of brain injury from the regions of
primary ischemic insult to adjacent regions of secondary injury
(Hartings et al., 2003; Mies et al., 1993). Therefore, in this
experiment we also evaluated, for the first time, whether FBC
could suppress periodic EDs in acute focal ischemia.
2. Results
2.1. Effect of FBC on perifocal EDs
Typical examples of the ECoG changes after focal ischemia are
shown in Fig. 3. Soon after the induction of focal ischemia,

periodic EDs were recorded from the peripheral cortex of the
infarct zone. In the non-cooled group, EDs were recorded
continuously for 8 h throughout the experiment (Fig. 3A). However
, in the cooling group, EDs were remarkably suppressed
during brain cooling at 15 1C, and incomplete suppression of
EDs persisted throughout the rewarming period (Fig. 3B).
The average power spectra of ECoG in the cooling and noncooling
groups in 60 s increments are shown in Fig. 3CandD.
In the non-cooling group (n¼6), there were no significant
differences in the power spectra in all frequency ranges
(1–30 Hz) among the power spectra at 1 h, 3 h and 7 h after
production of focal ischemia (Fig. 3C). However, in the cooling
group (n¼6), there were statistically-significant differences
between the power spectra at 1 h (precooling) and 3 h (cooling)
at all frequency ranges (1–30 Hz) by ANOVA with LSD post-hoc
test (n¼6, po0.01) (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, there were also
statistically-significant differences between the power spectra
at 1 h (precooling) and 7 h (rewarming) in all frequency bands
(po0.01), except for the delta frequency range (1–4 Hz) (po0.03,
Fig. 3D).
2.2. Effect of FBC on the infarct area
Typical delineations of ischemic damages with the triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining 12 h after photothrombotic
occlusion of cerebral microvessels in the cooling and noncooling
groups are shown in Fig. 4. When comparing the
macroscopic gross appearance of the cortical surfaces, the

ischemic zone was sharply demarcated in the non-cooled
cortex (Fig. 4A). However, the ischemic zone was indistinct in
the cooled cortex (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, coronal sections of
the cortices at the center of the ischemic zone indicated that
the ischemic zone was smaller and shallower in the cooled
cortex (Fig. 4C and D).
After taking photographs of coronal sections of the
cortices, the injured areas were calculated using Image J
software. Injured areas in the cooling and non-cooling groups
(n¼6, each) were 0.9970.30 mm2and 1.7170.54 mm2, respectively
(Fig. 5). The injured area of the cooling group was
statistically-significantly smaller than that of the non-cooling
group (po0.03).
2.3. The impact on neurobehavioral function
In the neurobehavioral function, the neurologic score of the
cooling group was significantly better than that of the noncooling
group at 24 h after the ischemic onset (Fig. 6A. po0.05
by Mann–Whitney U test).
The grip strengths of both forelimbs were analyzed for 5
days after surgery. In the ipsilateral forelimb, there was no
difference in grip strength after surgery between the cooling
and non-cooling groups (Fig. 6B). In the contralateral-to-stroke
forelimb, grip strengths were decreased after the ischemic
event and recovered to baseline at 3 days after onset. On the
other hand, in the cooling group, grip strengths were preserved
at the baseline level after the ischemic event. There was
statistically-significant difference in the grip strength of the
contralateral forelimb between the cooling and non-cooling
groups (po0.05 by paired t-test) at 2 days after surgery (Fig. 6C).
3. Discussion
We obtained the novel findings that periodic EDs in the
ischemic border were suppressed, infarct area was reduced
and neurobehaviour was preserved by FBC. These results
indicate that FBC acts neuroprotectively to the ischemic brain
and has therapeutic potential for the cerebral infarction.
We selected the 15 1C cooling as an optimal temperature,
because our previous study indicated that this cooling temperature
suppressed EDs induced by penicillin G with minimal
influence on neurobehavioral function and histology in the
seizure model (Fujioka et al., 2010b; Fujii et al., 2012). Power
spectrum analysis of ECoG indicated that focal cooling to 15 1C
suppressed all the frequency bands, which is consistent with
the results of our previous study (Fujii et al., 2012). Kida et al.
(2012)confirmed that cooling the brain to 20 1C suppressed
faster (alpha and beta) ECoG bands, and that cooling the brain
to 15 1C suppressed both the faster and slower (theta and delta)
frequency EEG bands . From these results, we speculate that
because 15 1C cooling suppressed neuronal activity in the
subcortex, all the frequency bands that originate from neuronal
networks in the cortex would be suppressed. The reason the
delta frequency of the power spectra alone did not show
differences between precooling and rewarming periods in the
cooling group (15 1C) is explained by the finding in our previous
study that slower frequency bands of ECoG are insusceptible to
the FBC because the origin of the slower frequency component
is deeper in the cortical layer than that of the faster frequency
components (Kida et al., 2012).
As described briefly in Section 1, the hypoxic/hypoglycemic
condition caused by ischemic metabolic failure leads to neuronal
membrane depolarization, further glutamate release,
spreading ionic imbalances, and eventual cell death (Mies
et al., 1993; Nedergaard and Hansen, 1993; Lipton, 1999). ECoG
seizure activity is a pathological sequela of ischemic brain
injury reflecting hyperexcitability in the neuronal networks
and can sometimes occur without overt clinical manifestations
(Vespa et al., 1999). Suppression of EDs by FBC suggests that FBC
would be protective in the focal cerebral ischemia, as well as
systemic hypothermia.
Several studies have reported the reductions of infarct size
after systemic hypothermia (Karibe et al., 1994; Markarian
et al., 1996;Maier et al., 1998;Berger et al., 2007;Kollmar et al.,
2007; Sakurazawa et al., 2012). In previous studies, mild
hypothermia (32–34 1C) has been selected to prevent the
development of systemic complications and reduce the
infarct size. We confirmed that FBC also reduced the infarct
size with TTC staining. Thus, FBC is also neuroprotective and
can be better applied to the treatment of focal ischemia with
a lower temperature (15 1C) compared with systemic
hypothermia, and does not induce complications.
In evaluating behavioral function, two assessments related
to motor functions were used in this study, because focal
ischemia was induced in the SI-MI area (Lee et al., 2002;
Bertelli and Mira, 1995). Deterioration of motor function also
reflects pathological insults. Thus, the grip strength test provides
a sensitive quantitative technique for assessing recovery
of motor function.
In our study, although reduction of grip strength was
observed in the contralateral forelimb 2 days after the ischemic
onset, grip strength was preserved in the cooled group. There
was a statistically-significant difference in grip strength 2 days
after surgery between the cooling and non-cooling groups.
These findings also suggest that the FBC suppresses the brain
injury caused by focal ischemia.

group was statistically-significantly smaller than that of the
non-cooling group (po0.03 by Mann–Whitney U test).

Motor function was restored to baseline at 3 days after the
ischemic event and there was no statistically-significant difference
between the cooling and non-cooling groups. This phenomenon
is supported by previous studies showing that most
animals recover from their impaired function, more or less after
brain injury because of active neuroplasticity (Alexis et al., 1995).
While the neuroprotective effect of FBC was confirmed in
our study, further proof is still necessary to confirm the
optimal cooling temperature, cooling period and rewarming
times, as well as comparison of the efficacy of FBC and
systemic hypothermia (Steiner et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2008;
Colbourne et al., 2000; Yanamoto et al., 2001).
In our institute, we have initiated development of an
implantable focal cooling system, including a cooling component
, temperature control system, battery, and a fail-safe
system. Recently, a focal cooling system, the ChillerPadTM,
was applied to a monkey model of traumatic brain injury and
in patients with stroke or aneurysm (King et al., 2010;Wagner
and Zuccarello, 2005). However, several issues remain and
must be resolved from the medical engineering point of view
before this neuromodulation can be used clinically. With the
continued development of such apparatuses, clinical application
of this implantable local cooling system may thus be
realized in the near future.
4. Experimental procedure
4.1. Animals
Healthy adult male Wistar rats (350750 g) housed in a
temperature-controlled room (23.072.0 1C) were used in the
study (n¼30 in total). Animal experiments were performed
using protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care Committee at Yamaguchi University School of Medicine.
4.2. Surgical procedures and the focal cerebral ischemia
model
Rats were anesthetized with sevoflurane (3% for induction via
a face mask, 2% after intubation and maintenance in an 80%/
20% mixture of oxygen and air by a ventilator (A.D.S.1000
Engler Engineering Corporation. USA). During the procedure,
rectal temperature was monitored and kept constant at
3770.2 1C by a temperature-controlled heating pad
(NS-TC10, Neuroscience Inc., Japan). The femoral artery and
femoral vein were cannulated for continuous monitoring of
arterial blood pressure, obtaining blood gas samples and drug
administration. Systemic blood pressure was maintained at
100–120 mmHg, and blood-gas data in the non-cooling and
cooling groups were controlled at pH 7.4470.04 and
7.4370.03, pO
2
of 202.6736.0 and 215.3737 and pCO
2
of
40.772.2 and 40.573.0.
The skull was fixed using a stereotactic apparatus (SR-6N,
Narishige, Japan). A scalp incision was performed at the
midline following injection of lidocaine (2%), and both the
Bregma and Lambda points were exposed after dissection of
the pericranial tissue. A small burr hole, 3 mm in diameter,
was made 4 mm lateral to the right and 0.5 mm anterior to
the Bregma and the dura matter remained intact. Focal
cerebral ischemia was achieved by the photothrombotic
method (Yao et al., 2003; Grome et al., 1988; Fujioka et al.,
2010b), illumination was initiated through the burr hole with
Fig. 6 – (A) Neurobehavioral test at 24 h post-ischemia, the neurologic score of the cooling group was better than that of

a fiber optic bundle of a cold light source (Fiber-Lite series 180
Dolan-Jenner Industries. Inc., USA) just after the Rose Bengal
injection (1.3 mg/100 g body weight in 0.9% sterile saline) via the
right femoral vein, and lasted for 20 min. In this manner, focal
cerebral ischemia of the primary sensorimotor (SI-MI) cortex of
the right hemisphere (2.5–5.5 mm lateral, 2.0 mm anterior,
1.0 mm posterior to the Bregma) was photochemically-induced
(Fig. 1).
4.3. Focal brain cooling
An additional craniotomy, including the burr hole, was made
over the ipsilateral SI-MI cortex (1.0–7.0 mm lateral, 3.0 mm
anterior, 4.0 mm posterior to the Bregma) just after induction
of the focal cerebral ischemia. A cooling device composed of a
thermoelectric chip that was originally developed in our
laboratory, and has been described previously (Fujioka et al.,
2010a, 2010b), was placed on the SI-MI cortex (Fig. 1). We
focally cooled the SI-MI cortex above the dura matter to a
temperature of 15 1C for 5 h from 1 h after the development of
focal ischemia. After the cooling period ended, the cortex was
spontaneously rewarmed and the temperature was maintained
for 1 h. The 15 1C cooling was selected because it
represents the borderline temperature affecting neurobehavioral
function (Fujii et al., 2012). Sham-operated rats underwent
craniotomy and placement of the cooling device.
The focal cooling experiments were composed of shortand
long-term studies. The short-term study evaluated the
periodic epileptiform discharges in the border zone of the
ischemic focus and of the infarct area. The long-term study
assessed the impact on neurobehavioral function (Fig. 2).
4.4. ECoG recordings and the spectral analysis
We placed a pair of ball-type electrodes (impedance 500 kO at
500 Hz) to detect the ECoG on the cortex at the boundary of
the ischemic area after placement of the cooling device
(Fig. 1). Thereafter, ECoGs were recorded continuously for
8 h in two channels (monopolar recording; with a reference
electrode inserted in the scalp) and analyzed using PowerLab
Chart 5 software (PowerLab Chart5; AD Instruments) at a
sampling rate of 2 kHz (low-cut filter 5 Hz, high-cut filter
60 Hz) for visual examination. To quantify the frequency
profiles, the power spectrum was calculated by fast Fourier
transform (FFT) analysis, which was performed for ECoG data
in 60 s intervals at 1 h (precooling), 3 h (cooling) and 7 h
(rewarming) after the development of focal ischemia (Fig. 2).
We analyzed the ECoG components in all conventional
frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha and beta
(delta¼1–4 Hz; theta¼4–9 Hz; alpha¼9–14 Hz; beta1¼14–25
Hz; beta2¼25–30 Hz). Six rats were used in each of the
cooling and non-cooling groups.
4.5. Measurement of the infarct area
All of the rats in both the cooling and non-cooling groups
(n¼6) were sacrificed after the recording of ECoG for 8 h. The
brains were immediately removed and incubated in a 2%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC Lot KWG
6634, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) at 4 1C for
12 h (Hatfield et al., 1991). Three serial sections from each
brain were cut at 1 mm intervals from the center of the
infarct zone and photographs of the sections were taken at
the middle of the 3 sections.
4.6. The impact on neurobehavioral function
After the focal cooling for 5 h, cortices were naturally
rewarmed and the temperature was maintained at the baseline
for 1 h (cooling group, n¼9). Thereafter, the scalp was
closed without repairing the cranial window. The rats
awakened from anesthesia were placed back in the cages.
To distinguish the effect of the sensorimotor injury, appropriate
control experiments were also conducted (non-cooling
group, n¼9).
Neurobehavioral function of each rat was evaluated after
surgery by an observer who was blinded to the experimental
procedure. Neurobehavioral function was assessed by five
categories of motor neurological findings, as follows: score 0:
no observable deficit, score 1: forelimb flexion, score 2:
forelimb flexion and decreased resistance to lateral push,
score 3: forelimb flexion, decreased resistance to lateral push
and unilateral circling, and score 4: forelimb flexion, unable
or difficult to ambulate (Lee et al., 2002). Neurobehavioral
function was assessed 24 h after the induction of focal
ischemia in the cooling and non-cooling groups (Fig. 2).
Grip strength test was also employed in the assessment of
neurobehavioral function. An inverted T-type bar 63 mm in
length and 103 cm wide connected to a grip strength meter
(Ugo Basile Comerio (VA), Italy) was used to measure graded
changes in the forelimb grip strength of the rats. Rats held
the bar and were gently pulled away from it in a smooth
manner, by grasping of the tail, in a steady motion, until they
released the bar. The grip strength meter measured the force
[g] required to break the rat’s grip. Prior to the surgery, rats
were trained on the apparatus for 5 days (n¼9). Each rat was
allowed to grasp the apparatus for three consecutive times, to
determine the strength of the forelimbs of the left, right and
both sides, respectively. The average grip strength for all
patterns was used as the baseline force. From 1 to 5 days after
surgery, three readings were taken for each rat and the
average force required was recorded as the individual grip
strength score for that rat (Fig. 2)( Bertelli and Mira, 1995).
4.7. Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparison of the
infarction area, neurobehavioral test between groups. The
grip strength test was performed by paired t-test. The power
spectrum was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by a LSD post-hoc test. These tests were
performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA). The data are expressed as the mean7SD.
p-valueso0.05 were considered significant.
