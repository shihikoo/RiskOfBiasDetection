Key Points
• Hemostasis, thrombosis, and
ischemic brain infarction
efficiently occur at
unexpectedly low platelet
counts in mice.
• The threshold platelet count
required for occlusive
thrombus formation differs
between thrombosis models.
Platelets are essential mediators of hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet counts (PCs)
in humans average 250 platelets/nL, but it is not entirely clear how platelet numbers
affect hemostasis and occurrence of thrombotic events. Mice, displaying PCs of∼1000
platelets/nL, are widely used to assess platelet function in (patho-)physiology, but also
in this species, the significance of PC for hemostasis and thrombotic disease is not
established. We reduced PCs in mice to defined ranges between 0 and 1000 platelets/nL
by platelet-depleting antibodies and challenged them in different arterial thrombosis
models: the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) stroke model and tail
bleeding experiments. We show that thrombotic occlusion of the injured aorta and the
carotid artery were partially impaired when PCs were reduced by 70% or 80%, respectively.
In contrast, tail bleeding times and thrombus formation in small arterioles
were largely unaffected by reductions of PC up to 97.5%. Similarly, infarct growth and
neurological deficits after tMCAO were unaffected by reductions of PCs up to 90%,
whereas a further reduction was protective. These results reveal that arterial thrombosis, cerebral infarction, and hemostasis in
mice efficiently occur at unexpectedly low PCs, which may have implications for humans at risk of thrombotic or hemorrhagic
disease. (Blood. 2013;121(24):4938-4947)
Introduction
Platelets are small anucleated cell fragments derived from the cytoplasm
of bone marrow megakaryocytes. They circulate in the blood
stream for;8 to 10 days and “survey” the integrity of the vascular
system by discriminating between intact and injured vessel walls.
On endothelial damage, platelets rapidly adhere to the vessel wall,
become activated, and recruit additional platelets to form a stable
thrombus that seals the site of injury. This process is essential to limit
posttraumatic blood loss, but it is also a major pathomechanism
underlying thrombotic vessel occlusion in the setting of myocardial
infarction and stroke.1,2 The platelet count (PC) of healthy humans
ranges from 150 to 450 platelets/nL blood, with an average of;250
platelets/nL, and thrombocytopenia is diagnosed at PCs ,150
platelets/nL.3 Thrombocytopenia occurs relatively frequent in humans
and can be caused by different mechanisms in the context of
a large variety of pathologies or medical treatments. Immune thrombocytopenia
(ITP) is an autoimmune disease where autoantibodies
directed against platelet surface antigens trigger platelet destruction
and may cause moderate to severe bleeding symptoms.4 Immunemediated
drug-induced thrombocytopenia induces peripheral platelet
destruction by drug-dependent antibodies that bind to platelet
surface glycoproteins only in the presence of the sensitizing drug.5,6
Other drugs induce thrombocytopenia as a major side effect by
affecting platelet production in the bone marrow through direct
myelosupression.7,8 Thrombocytopenia can also be associated with
chronic infections such as HIV9 or hepatitis C10 or may be an
accessory syndrome of hereditary diseases.11-13
Generally, medical treatment of thrombocytopenia with functional
platelets is indicated in adult patients with a platelet count
of,30 platelets/nL blood.14-17However, it is widely accepted that
the decision to treat thrombocytopenia should not entirely be based
on the PC, but rather made in the context of clinical symptoms and
disease progression.16,18 Indeed, studies in humans have shown
that the bleeding risk at reduced PCs is influenced by the individual’s age,19,20 the occurrence of trauma,21 genetic susceptibility
, environmental effects, medication, or comorbidity.22-25Similarly,
studies in mice have shown that low PCs alone do not cause spontaneous
bleeding, but rather a combination of a low platelet count
and additional factors, such as binding of antibodies to endothelial
cells,26 inflammation,27 or the nature of the target antigen of antiplatelet
antibodies28 determine the occurrence of hemorrhage.
On the other hand, the link between PCs and the occurrence of
acute ischemic disease states, such as myocardial infarction or stroke,
remains unclear. Two studies revealed an increased incidence of
thromboembolic events in humans with ITP and proposed different
mechanisms that might explain this thrombotic tendency.3,29 Mice,
with an average PC of 1000 platelets/nL blood, are an important
model system to study hemostasis and the pathomechanisms underlying
ischemic diseases. Although platelet counts can efficiently be

lowered in mice, no systematic study has been reported that assessed
the significance of PCs for normal hemostasis and susceptibility to
experimental ischemic disease states in these animals.
In our study, we induced different grades of thrombocytopenia in
mice and subjected them to different models of occlusive thrombus
formation and ischemic stroke. We show that (experimental) occlusive
thrombus formation and ischemic brain infarction are not or
only very moderately affected by a reduction of platelet counts by
>70%. Similarly, tail bleeding times were unaltered over a wide
range of platelet count reductions.
Materials and methods
Mice
Bleeding time and thrombosis model experiments were performed with
C57/Bl-6 and 129/Sv mice. For the stroke experiments, 129/Sv/C57/Bl-6
mice were used. Animal studies were approved by the district government
of Lower Franconia. Mice were between 6 and 12 weeks of age, if not
indicated differently.
Chemicals and reagents
Medetomidine (Pfizer), midazolam (Roche Pharma AG), fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag
GmbH), high-molecular-weight heparin (Sigma), adenosine 59-diphosphate
(ADP) (Sigma-Aldrich), thrombin (Roche Diagnostics), convulxin (Enzo
Life Science), and rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (Accurate Chemical) were
purchased. The antibody against activated integrin aIIbb3 (JON/A-PE),
platelet-depleting anti-glycoprotein (GP) Ibaantibody, and IgG control were
from Emfret Analytics. All other antibodies were generated and modified
in our laboratory.28
Platelet depletion and calculation of the platelet count
For platelet depletion, mice received rat anti-mouse GPIba antibodies or
rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum intravenously in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) 12 hours prior to the experiment. Control mice received the same
volume of vehicle or irrelevant rat IgG. To measure the platelet count, mice
were bled retro-orbitally, and the blood samples were collected into heparincontaining
tubes. The blood sample (50 mL) was further diluted with modified Tyrode–N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES;
5 mM glucose, 0.35% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to a final dilution of
1:20. Fifty microliters of the diluted sample was stained with conjugated
anti-integrinallbb3-phycoerythrin antibody (clone JON228) and anti–GPV-
fluorescein isothiocyanate (clone DOM128) for 15 minutes at room temperature
to identify the platelet population in whole blood (supplemental
Figure 1 on the Blood website). After addition of 500 mL PBS, fluorescent
beads (AccuCount fluorescent particles, 5.2 mm; Spherotec) were added,
and the sample was analyzed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). The
platelet count for each mouse was determined prior to the experiment.
Flow cytometric analysis of glycoprotein expression
and platelet activation
To determine the glycoprotein expression levels, 50mL diluted blood (1:20)
was incubated withfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–labeled antibodies for
15 minutes at room temperature and directly analyzed. For platelet activation
studies, 50mL diluted blood was washed twice in Tyrode-HEPES buffer and
diluted in Tyrode-HEPES buffer containing 2 mM CaCl
2
. Samples were
activated with agonists and stained with antibodies against the activated form
of integrin aIIbb3 (JON/A-PE) and anti–P-selectin for 15 minutes at 37°C.
Tail bleeding time assay
Tail bleeding times were determined as described previously.30 In brief,
1 mm of the tail tip was amputated, and the tails were immersed in 0.9%
isotonic saline at 37°C. The time to complete arrest of bleeding (no blood
flow for 1 minute) was determined.
Intravital microscopy of thrombus formation in FeCl
3
-injured
mesenteric arterioles
Intravital microscopy was performed as described previously.31 In brief,
injury of mesenteric arterioles was induced by application of a filter paper
saturated with 20% FeCl
3.
Adhesion and aggregation of fluorescently
labeled platelets in arterioles were monitored for 40 minutes or until
complete occlusion occurred (blood flow stopped for 1 minute). Mice were
4 weeks of age.
Mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta
The abdominal cavity of anesthetized mice was opened to expose the
abdominal aorta. An ultrasonicflowprobe (0.5PSB699; Transonic Systems)
was placed around the abdominal aorta, and thrombus formation was
induced by a single firm compression with a forceps. Blood flow was
monitored for 30 minutes.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed as
described previously.32 In brief, a thread was advanced through the carotid
artery into the middle cerebral artery to reduce cerebral blood flow and
removed after 1 hour to allow reperfusion. The extent of infarction was
assessed 24 hours after reperfusion on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride–
stained brain sections. The global neurologic status was scored as previously
described.33 Motor function and coordination were graded using the
grip test.34
FeCl
3
injury of the carotid artery
The right carotid artery was exposed through a midline incision in the neck.
An ultrasonic flowprobe was placed around the vessel, and thrombosis was
induced by topical application of a 0.5-mm2 filter paper saturated with 10%
FeCl
3
for 90 seconds. Bloodflow was monitored for 30 minutes or until full
occlusion (.5 minutes) of the vessel occurred.35
Triple anesthesia
Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a combination of midazolam/
medetomidine/fentanyl (5/0.5/0.05 mg/kg body weight).
Statistics
For statistical analysis between experimental groups, we applied the oneway
analysis of variance with Tukey as the post hoc test. All statistical
evaluation was done with OriginPro 8.6 (Origin Laboratory Corporation).
For a test of independence, the two-tailed Fisher’s test for control vs the
respective group was used. P, .05 compared with control was considered
statistically significant (*P, .05; **P, .01; ***P, .001).
Results
To study the impact of PCs on hemostasis and experimental thrombosis
, thrombocytopenia was induced in mice by injection of polyclonal
anti-glycoprotein (GP) Iba antibodies, which deplete circulating
platelets in mice independently of immune effector mechanisms.28,36
In a first set of experiments, we determined the antibody doses
required to achieve defined PCs 12 hours after injection. Injection of
vehicle (PBS) or rat IgG (100mg/mouse) had no detectable effect on
the PC in control mice, which averaged;1100 platelets/nL blood,
similar to that previously reported by others.37,38Injection of increasing
amounts (1-5 mg) of the anti-GPIba antibody dose-dependently
reduced the PC (Figure 1). To induce virtually complete platelet

depletion (,15 platelets/nL blood), mice received 100 mgofthe
anti-GPIbaantibodies (Figure 1). Importantly, we did not observe
any signs of spontaneous bleeding in such severely thrombocytopenic
animals during visual inspection of the skin and inner
organs. However, on vessel injury during blood sampling or
surgery, animals depleted to,15 platelets/nL blood had difficulties
sealing the wound and showed increased and prolonged bleeding at
the site of injury.
To study possible effects of the anti-GPIbaantibody treatment on
the circulating platelet population, mice received 2.0 mgantibody,
and platelets were analyzed after 12 hours byflow cytometry. At this
time point, the PC was reduced to;30% (3346 86 platelets/nL;
control was 1100699 platelets/nL), and a slight increase in the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of major glycoproteins compared with
controls was detectable (Figure 2A). This increase could be attributed
to the appearance of a small population of newly generated platelets
displaying an increased size and, accordingly, increased surface expression
levels of prominent glycoprotein receptors, which were
visible as a shoulder in the histogram (Figure 2B, left). In contrast, the
size and surface glycoprotein expression levels in the main platelet
population were unaltered (Figure 2B, right). As young and large
platelets might display altered function and have been associated with
prothrombotic properties,29,39 we tested the reactivity of platelets in
partially depleted mice and found normal integrin aIIbb3 activation
and P-selectin exposure in response to different agonists (ADP,
thrombin, and convulxin; Figure 2C). These results confirmed that
anti-GPIba treatment efficiently reduces the PC in mice without
affecting the function of the remaining platelet population.
Only very low platelet counts are required to maintain normal
hemostasis in mice
To test the significance of the PC for normal hemostasis, mice were
subjected to a tail bleeding time assay 12 hours after induction of
thrombocytopenia. In the control group, 48 of 49 mice arrested
bleeding within the observation period, with a mean occlusion time
of 806 35 seconds, and similar results were obtained in mice with
PCs reduced down to 200 platelets/nL (Figure 3). Remarkably, also
in the groups of mice with PCs ranging from 199 to 100 platelets/nL
and 99 to 25 platelets/nL, most of the animals arrested bleeding,
although the mean bleeding times were significantly prolonged
compared with the control. In sharp contrast, mice with a PC,25
platelets/nL (ie,,2.5% of control) were not able to arrest bleeding.
Importantly, we obtained similar results with 129/Sv mice (supplemental
Figure 3A), excluding that mouse strain-specific effects
accounted for the unexpectedly low platelet count required to maintain
normal hemostasis. To exclude that unrecognized side effects
of the platelet-depleting anti-GPIb antibodies contributed to this
effect, we analyzed bleeding times in mice in which thrombocytopenia
had been induced by a rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum
(supplemental Figure 2A). Interestingly, this treatment not only
reduced the PC, but in addition partially compromised the reactivity
of the remaining platelet population to thrombin and the
GPVI agonist convulxin (supplemental Figure 2B). Despite this
nonspecificsideeffect,weobtainedve ry similar results in the
bleeding time experiments as for anti-GPIb–treated mice (supplemental
Figure 2C).
These results demonstrated that the arrest of bleeding at a wound
site only requires very low PCs in mice, suggesting that hemostatic
defects in thrombocytopenic mice may only occur when the low
platelet counts are associated with altered platelet function, vascular
defects, or other pathogenic factors.
Only platelet count reductions >70% significantly affect
occlusive thrombus formation in the aorta
To test the significance of PCs for occlusive arterial thrombus formation
, we subjected groups of mice with defined degrees of thrombocytopenia
to three well-established thrombosis models. In thefirst
model, the abdominal aorta is mechanically injured, and occlusive
thrombus formation rapidly occurs through collagen-dependent mechanisms.35 The aorta represents the largest artery in mice, with rather
low shear rates but high blood throughput. As shown in Figure 4A,
24 of 25 control mice formed occlusive thrombi in 247 6 96
seconds, and very similar results were obtained in mice with platelet
counts ranging from 699 to 400 platelets/nL. In contrast, when PCs
were lowered to 399 to 300 platelets/nL, only 12 of 15 mice formed
occlusive thrombi, and this was significantly delayed compared
with the controls (5116 335 seconds, P5 .04). At PCs between
299 and 200 platelets/nL blood, occlusive thrombus formation became
severely impaired, and we observed two different outcomes:
either occlusive thrombus formation took place (461 6 313
seconds, 4 of 9 mice, P5 .63) or occlusive thrombus formation
was abolished (5 of 9 mice, P5 .002). At PCs,200 platelets/nL
blood, occlusion was only seen in 1 of 9 mice, and this occurred
at a late time point (1502 seconds). Representative blood flow
measurements are shown in Figure 4B. The medium gray line
(group 399 to 300 platelets/nL) indicates that the embolization of
large thrombus fragments partly contributed to the delayed occlusion
times. These results revealed that experimental occlusive
thrombus formation in a mechanically injured large vessel of mice
can efficiently occur at PCs of 30% of control, whereas it is increasingly
impaired on further reduction of platelet numbers.
Occlusive thrombus formation in the FeCl
3
-injured carotid
artery is less affected by reduced platelet counts compared with
the aorta injury model
Next, we subjected groups of mice with defined degrees of thrombocytopenia
to a model where the carotid artery is chemically injured
by the topical application of FeCl
3
and thrombus formation
occurs through collagen and thrombin-driven mechanisms (Figure 5).35
The carotid artery represents a medium-sized vessel where moderate
shear rates prevail.

In the control group, 18 of 19 mice formed occlusive thrombi
within 3456 58 seconds, and very similar results were obtained in
mice with PCs reduced down to 300 platelets/nL (Figure 5A). At PCs
of 299 to 200 platelets/nL, a significant increase in the mean
occlusion time was observed (4776122 seconds,P5.03), and 2 of
14 vessels failed to occlude within the observation period. A further
delay and impairment of occlusive thrombus formation was detectable
in mice with PCs of 199 to 100 platelet/nL, with only 4 of 7 mice
occluding within 5146 121 seconds (P5 .06). This was clearly
different from the aorta injury model where occlusive thrombus
formation was already abrogated at PCs,200 platelets/nL blood. At
PCs,100 platelets/nL blood, 6 of 7 mice failed to occlude (P5
.0002 compared with control), and the one remaining vessel occluded
very late (928 seconds). In Figure 5B, representative blood flow
measurements of mice with reduced PCs and respective controls are
shown. These results revealed that occlusive thrombus formation in
the chemically injured carotid artery is only severely impaired when
PCs drop to,100 platelets/nL blood (ie,;10% of control).

Platelet counts of 2.5% of control are sufficient to efficiently
occlude FeCl
3
-injured mesenteric arterioles
The above described data suggested that the vascular bed and/or the
type of vessel injury influenced the threshold PC required to achieve
vessel occlusion. To study this in more detail, we tested groups of
mice with defined PCs in a third well-established thrombosis model,
where a FeCl
3
injury is induced in mesenteric arterioles, representing
small vessels where high shear rates prevail. Injury was induced by
topical application of 20% FeCl
3
, and thrombus formation of
fluorescently labeled platelets was monitored by intravital fluorescence
microscopy. In all mice, the time to the formation of the first
thrombus with a diameter of.10mm (Figure 6A) and the time to full
vessel occlusion (Figure 6B) were determined. Remarkably, the time
tofirst thrombus formation was not significantly altered in mice with
PCs reduced down to 25 platelets/nL (Figure 6A). However, at lower
PCs, we made 2 different observations: either appearance of thrombi
.10 mm was delayed or abolished (Figure 6A; 4/8 vessels). Also
remarkable, the time to vessel occlusion was not significantly altered
compared with control down to a platelet count of 100 platelets/nL
blood (Figure 6B). At PCs,100 platelets/nL, we observed 3 different
outcomes: occlusive thrombus formation was comparable to control,
delayed, or abolished (Figure 6B). At a PC,25 platelets/nL blood,
occlusive thrombus formation was abolished in all vessels (P 5
.0001). Representative images of thrombus formation in the different
groups are shown in Figure 6C-F. Importantly, similar results were
obtained in anti-GPIb–treated 129/Sv mice and in C57/Bl-6 mice
rendered thrombocytopenic by rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum,
excluding mouse strain- or antibody-specific effects to be responsible
for the unexpectedly low platelet counts required to achieve full
vessel occlusion in this model (supplemental Figures 2D and 3B).
Only 10% of the normal platelet count is sufficient to induce full
brain infarction following tMCAO
Ischemic stroke is caused by thromboembolic occlusion of a cerebral
artery, leading to focal ischemia and infarction of the affected brain
territory. We recently showed that blocking of distinct platelet surface
receptors essential for platelet adhesion and activation protects
from ischemic stroke after tMCAO in mice.34,40,41
To test the significance of the PC for infarct growth following
focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected groups of mice with defined
PCs to tMCAO (60 minutes) and assessed infarct size and neurological
deficits after 24 hours. Four groups of mice were analyzed
with platelet counts of 1300 to 700 (control), 699 to 400, 399 to 110,
and,110 platelets/nL. Remarkably, a reduction of PCs down to 110
platelets/nL blood had no significant effect (P5.85 for group 699 to
400 platelets/nL and P5 .56 for group 399 to 110 platelets/nL) on
infarct size at 24 hours after tMCAO (Figure 7A-B) and also did not
significantly alter the resulting neurological deficits compared with
control as determined by the grip test (Figure 7C), assessing coordination
and motor function, and the Bederson score (Figure 7D),
assessing global neurological function. The critical platelet dependency
of this pathology, however, became apparent when platelet
counts were reduced to,110 platelets/nL blood. In these animals, the
infarct size at 24 hours was significantly reduced (P5.0003) to onethird
compared with control (Figure 7A-B), and this was associated
with improved neurological function (Figure 7C-D). Interestingly, we
did not observe major intracranial bleeding in any of these mice,
suggesting that even very low platelet numbers are sufficient to
prevent hemorrhage in the ischemic brain. These data revealed that
;10% of the normal platelet count is sufficient to mediate full brain
infarction following focal cerebral ischemia.
Discussion
We used a well-characterized murine model of thrombocytopenia to
address the question of to what extent isolated thrombocytopenia
affects hemostasis and acute thrombotic or thrombo-inflammatory
disease states. We show that a reduction of 70% to 80% of the PC
did not impair occlusive thrombus formation in large vessels, and
even lower PCs were effective to maintain hemostasis and thrombotic
occlusion of small arterioles. These data provide thefirst direct
experimental evidence that only severe PC reductions have significant effects on hemostasis and thrombotic or thromboinflammatory pathologies.
Several studies in humans consistently found that thrombocytopenia
with functional platelets generally induces no or only minor
bleeding symptoms, with only rare cases of life-threatening hemorrhages.4,42 This is in line with our observations in mice demonstrating
that isolated thrombocytopenia barely affects normal
hemostasis as assessed in a tail bleeding assay. Although there is
no clear correlation between bleeding time and bleeding risk,43 one
may speculate on the grounds of these results that, in humans, the
occurrence of bleeding episodes during thrombocytopenia might to
a great extent be determined by other factors than the degree of

thrombocytopenia. This has impressively been demonstrated in mice
where only the combination of (severe) thrombocytopenia and
inflammation resulted in spontaneous hemorrhage in different
organs.27 In-depth clinical studies will be required to identify
the factors that may trigger hemorrhagic complications in thrombocytopenic
patients.
Although numerous patient studies assessed the causal relationship
between thrombocytopenia and increased bleeding, only very
limited and partially contradictory information is available on the
effect of isolated thrombocytopenia on the risk of acute thrombotic
disease in humans. Sarpatwari et al3 described an increased risk for
arterial and venous thromboembolism in humans with ITP. Others
reported that the risk for arterial thrombosis was decreased in male
ITP patients but was twofold increased in female ITP patients compared
with non-thrombocytopenic controls.44Similarly, various case
reports of thrombotic events such as ischemic stroke45or myocardial
infarction during ITP46 indicate that thrombocytopenia caused by
autoantibodies does not generally protect humans from thrombotic
events but in some cases may even increase the thrombotic risk. One
possible explanation could be that autoantibodies directed against
platelet surface proteins may affect the function and/or the activation
state of the cells, thereby increasing their reactivity. This assumption
is supported by observations in mice showing that the antigenic specificity of antiplatelet receptor antibodies to a great extent determines
possible functional alterations in the cells and also whether they are
cleared from the circulation.28,47,48
The anti-GPIba antibodies used here are known to rapidly deplete
circulating platelets independently of their Fc portion and thus
immune effector mechanisms,28thereby inducing only minimal side
effects. In line with this, we found that the population of circulating
platelets after anti-GPIba antibody treatment was functionally intact
(Figure 2). The appearance of a small population of newly generated
platelets did not lead to a significantly different activation response
of the overall platelet population. We can, however, not definitively
rule out subtle differences in the reactivity of the newly generated
platelets compared with the older platelets, but we consider it very
unlikely that such differences, if existent, account for the unexpectedly
robust hemostatic and thrombotic activity in the thrombocytopenic
animals. Our model system therefore allows studies on the
effect of a largely isolated thrombocytopenia on hemostasis and
thrombosis. Using this model system, we observed no signs of
spontaneous bleeding in severely thrombocytopenic mice, confirming
that thrombocytopenia alone is not sufficient to induce spontaneous
hemorrhage in mice.27 Furthermore, we found that even
severe reductions of the PC (;97.5%) had no major effect on hemostasis
or occlusive thrombus formation in small arterioles (Figures
3 and 6). In contrast, occlusive thrombus formation in larger arteries
required higher PCs (carotid artery:;20%; aorta:;30% of control),
demonstrating that considerable differences in the sensitivity for PC

reductions exist between these thrombosis models. This may at least
partially be explained by the different diameters of the injured
vessels, indicating that the formation of a large vessel occluding
thrombus may require a higher PC to be accomplished than a
thrombus that occludes a smaller vessel. Considering that in smaller
vessels higher shear rates prevail, one may also speculate that the
mechanisms promoting platelet recruitment and activation as well as
thrombus stabilization under such conditions may be more stringent
and therefore less dependent on the actual number of platelets per
blood volume than under low or intermediate shear conditions. In

line with this assumption, occlusive thrombus formation in the aorta
of thrombocytopenic mice is not only delayed due to slower recruitment
of platelets from the circulation, but also compromised by
the embolization of large thrombus fragments, indicating impaired
thrombus stability that might be a consequence of inefficient local
accumulation of released or locally produced agonists, such as ADP,
thromboxane A2, or thrombin.
Additionally, other factors such as blood pressure in the injured
vessel or the nature of the injury likely influence the sensitivity of
the different models to PC reductions, whereas the mechanism of
platelet count reduction or mouse strain-specific effects could be
largely excluded in our study (supplemental Figures 2 and 3). It
may be difficult to completely dissect how these and possible other
factors determine the “threshold PC” required for vessel occlusion
in a certain vascular bed under given experimental conditions, and
the situation in diseased humans may be even more complex. However
, irrespective of this important question, our data reveal that
vessel-occluding platelet-rich thrombi can form with virtually
unaltered kinetics at remarkably low PCs in mice, indicating that
thrombocytopenia might also not provide protection from thrombotic
events in humans.
Genetic mouse models are increasingly used to study platelet
function in vitro and in vivo.49 Some of these mouse lines display
altered platelet function in association with reduced PCs.30,50 Based
on our data, we speculate that bleeding abnormalities or impaired
experimental thrombosis in such animals is to a great extent related
to the functional platelet defect rather than reduced PCs, which may
have important implications for the interpretation of the data
obtained in these mouse models. On the basis of this assumption,
one could also speculate that the bleeding phenotypes seen in humans
suffering from inherited platelet disorders such as the gray platelet
syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or Berhard-Soulier syndrome
are primarily caused by functional platelet defects but not
by reduced PC.
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death or severe disability
worldwide, and platelets are essential components of vesseloccluding
emboli in this setting. On the basis of the data from our
thrombosis models, we speculate that also the formation of large
embolizing thrombi would not be strongly affected by moderate to
even pronounced PC reductions. However, clearly, further studies
in animals or in patients will be required to test this directly. A
major challenge in stroke treatment is, however, that spontaneous
or therapeutic recanalization of a previously occluded cerebral
artery is often followed by a reperfusion injury of the affected brain
territory leading to the development of large infarcts. The exact
mechanisms by which platelets contribute to this pathology have
not been established but integrin aIIbb3-dependent thrombus
formation was shown not to be essential.34 Rather, platelets appear
to orchestrate a thrombo-inflammatory cascade involving T cells
and the contact activation system finally leading to a dysregulation
of the blood-brain barrier and neurologic damage.2,41 Experimental
evidence suggests that the GPIb-von Willebrand factor (vWF)-
GPVI signaling axis in platelets is of central importance in this
setting, but the molecular interplay of the contributing pathogenic
factors is currently unclear.34 In this study, we found that infarct
growth following tMCAO was virtually unaffected by PC reductions

up to 90%, whereas a further reduction was highly protective
(Figure 7). This also indicates that thrombo-inflammatory pathologies
, similar to occlusive thrombus formation, may not be significantly affected even by pronounced platelet count reductions.
Taken together, we showed that hemostasis, thrombosis, and
ischemic brain infarction are largely unaffected over a wide range
of PC reduction in mice. Although data obtained in experimental
animals cannot be directly extrapolated to the situation in humans,
we speculate that low PCs alone would not significantly reduce the
risk of thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
This may have important implications for the risk assessment in
cardiovascular patients but also for the development of novel
therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat acute ischemic events.
