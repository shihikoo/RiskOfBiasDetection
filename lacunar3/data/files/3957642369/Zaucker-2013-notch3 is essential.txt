INTRODUCTION
The Notch signaling pathway is widely conserved among metazoans.
Vertebrate genomes contain several Notch paralogs, which control
key developmental decisions at numerous stages and in diverse tissues
and organs (Andersson et al., 2011; Gazave et al., 2009). The Notch
pathway is ideally suited for signaling between adjacent cells because
both the Notch receptor and its ligands are transmembrane proteins
(Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). This feature allows Notch signals to assign
different fates to adjacent cells with similar developmental potential.
According to prevailing models, feedback mechanisms amplify small
differences in the expression levels of Notch receptor and ligand in
neighboring cells, resulting in active Notch signaling in one cell and
suppression of Notch signaling in the other. This lateral inhibition
mechanism directs binary fate decisions in many species and
developmental contexts, including neurogenesis in Drosophila
(Ruohola et al., 1991), development of the inner ear and the intestine
in vertebrates (Cotanche and Kaiser, 2010; Crosnier et al., 2005;
Haddon et al., 1998a; Heath, 2010), and development of the vertebrate
vasculature (Gridley, 2010). In the developing vasculature, Notch
signaling inhibits endothelial cells from adopting a tip cell fate during
sprouting angiogenesis (Sainson et al., 2005). Accordingly, inhibition
of Notch signaling in zebrafish and mouse leads to increased
sprouting and branching of vessels due to supernumerary tip cells
(Leslie et al., 2007; Siekmann and Lawson, 2007). The Notch pathway
also confers arterial identity to endothelial cells and vascular mural
cells [e.g. vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and pericytes]
(Domenga et al., 2004; Lawson et al., 2001).
In Drosophila, notch pathway mutants have neurogenic
phenotypes characterized by an excess of neuronal cells (Campos-
Ortega, 1985). The role of Notch signaling in limiting neurogenesis
is conserved in vertebrates (Lewis, 1996). Mutants disrupting
vertebrate pathway components also display neurogenic phenotypes
(Imayoshi et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2008). These phenotypes have been
attributed to excessive differentiation of neural progenitor cells
(NPCs) into neurons, which depletes the progenitor pool in notch
pathway mutants. Thus, Notch regulates the balance between
neuronal differentiation and maintenance of progenitor cell fates,
including of radial glia. Notch also drives differentiation of other glial
cell types (e.g. Müller glia of the retina), and Notch activity is thought
to broadly control the balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis
(Pierfelice et al., 2011). In addition, Notch activity promotes
expansion of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), while inhibiting
their terminal differentiation (Park and Appel, 2003; Wang et al.,
1998). Outside of the nervous system, the Notch pathway contributes
to the maintenance of other progenitor and stem cell populations,
such as Leydig progenitor cells of the testis and melanocyte stem
cells (Moriyama et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2008).

SUMMARY
Mutations in the human NOTCH3 gene cause CADASIL syndrome (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is an inherited small vessel disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations including vasculopathy,
neurodegeneration and dementia. Here we report two mutations in the zebrafish notch3 gene, one identified in a previous screen for mutations
with reduced expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and another caused by a retroviral insertion. Reduced mbp expression in notch3 mutant
embryos is associated with fewer oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Despite an early neurogenic phenotype, mbp expression recovered at
later developmental stages and some notch3 homozygous mutants survived to adulthood. These mutants, as well as adult zebrafish carrying both
mutant alleles together, displayed a striking stress-associated accumulation of blood in the head and fins. Histological analysis of mutant vessels
revealed vasculopathy, including: an enlargement (dilation) of vessels in the telencephalon and fin, disorganization of the normal stereotyped
arrangement of vessels in the fin, and an apparent loss of arterial morphological structure. Expression of hey1, a well-known transcriptional target
of Notch signaling, was greatly reduced in notch3 mutant fins, suggesting that Notch3 acts via a canonical Notch signaling pathway to promote
normal vessel structure. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of dilated vessels in notch3 mutant fins and revealed that the vessel walls
of presumed arteries showed signs of deterioration. Gaps in the arterial wall and the presence of blood cells outside of vessels in mutants indicated
that compromised vessel structure led to hemorrhage. In notch3 heterozygotes, we found elevated expression of both notch3 itself and target genes,
indicating that specific alterations in gene expression due to partial loss of Notch3 function might contribute to the abnormalities observed in
heterozygous larvae and adults. Our analysis of zebrafish notch3 mutants indicates that Notch3 regulates OPC development and mbp gene expression
in larvae, and maintains vascular integrity in adults.

Notch3 in CNS and vascular integrity RESEARCH ARTICLE
Mutations in the human NOTCH3 gene cause CADASIL
syndrome (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is a
small vessel disease that has been diagnosed in more than 500
families worldwide (Hervé and Chabriat, 2010). Clinical symptoms
comprise migraine with aura, leukoaraiosis, subcortical infarcts,
mood disturbances, apathy and dementia (Hervé and Chabriat,
2010). Many pathological mutations in CADASIL result in an odd
number of cysteines in one of the EGF repeats of NOTCH3, which
is thought to cause aggregation of the NOTCH3 extracellular
domain (NECD) in individuals with CADASIL (Joutel et al., 1997;
Opherk et al., 2009). The majority of individuals with CADASIL
display leukoaraiosis and ischemic events that are particularly
prominent in the white matter of the CNS, a region characterized
by low blood flow that consists primarily of glial cells and
myelinated axons (Lee et al., 2012). In the CNS, oligodendrocytes
form myelin, a multi-lamellar sheath that allows for rapid impulse
propagation by saltatory conduction in the vertebrate nervous
system. Damage to oligodendrocytes and demyelination of axons
can cause or contribute to neurodegenerative pathology, as occurs
in the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Prineas and Parratt, 2012).
The demyelination of axons might contribute to the cerebral
atrophy seen in individuals with CADASIL (Viswanathan et al.,
2006); however, axonal damage and atrophy in the white matter
has also been viewed as a secondary defect to vascular disruption.
Histopathological analysis revealed that CADASIL is a
vasculopathy of small cerebral and systemic arteries (Baudrimont
et al., 1993; Ruchoux et al., 1995). In CADASIL, the VSMCs show
signs of degeneration and eventually are lost. Endothelial
dysfunction and ultrastructural endothelial changes also have been
reported in CADASIL. Although vascular changes are observed all
along the arterial tree, and in liver, muscle, spleen and skin, organ
failure is only apparent in the brain and retina (Robinson et al.,
2001; Ruchoux et al., 1995). It is not clear why widespread
arteriopathy does not cause more global organ defects.
In an effort to better understand CADASIL pathologies, Notch3
knockout, knock-in and transgenic mouse models have been
developed (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011; Arboleda-Velasquez
et al., 2005; Joutel, 2011; Joutel et al., 2004; Krebs et al., 2003; Monet-
Leprêtre et al., 2009; Ruchoux et al., 2003). The defective
constrictive responses upon experimental challenge by proximal
middle cerebral artery occlusion and the enlarged arteries with
thinner walls that are observed in Notch3 knockout mice indicate
roles for Notch3 in arterial VSMC specification and maturation in
tail vessels, and in maintaining vascular tone (Arboleda-Velasquez
et al., 2008; Belin de Chantemèle et al., 2008; Domenga et al., 2004;
Krebs et al., 2003). Although arteriopathies in the tail and, when
challenged, cortical vessels (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008) have
been observed in knockout mice, important pathologies and
hallmarks of CADASIL – including Notch3 ectodomain deposits,
leukoencephalopathy and lacunar infarcts – have not been found.
Nevertheless, Notch3 knockout mice show a higher susceptibility
for ischemic stroke (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008). None of the
existing CADASIL mice fully recapitulates the human disease. In
light of this variability among the available Notch3 and CADASIL
animal models, the mechanism by which Notch3 mutations cause
CADASIL symptoms is not known, and the mechanism and extent
of interdependence of the vascular, white matter and other disease
phenotypes remain to be clarified.
In a genetic screen to identify genes that are required for the
development of myelinated axons in zebrafish, st51 was discovered
as a mutation that reduced myelin basic protein (mbp) mRNA
expression in the CNS (Pogoda et al., 2006). Here we show that
st51 disrupts the zebrafish notch3 gene. Analysis of notch3st51 and
an insertional allele of notch3 revealed that notch3 is required for
OPC development and myelin gene expression during larval
development. At later stages, mbp expression increased in the CNS
of notch3 mutants, and some homozygous mutants survived to
adulthood. In these adult mutants, we observed bleeding in
response to mild stress. Histological and electron microscopy (EM)
analyses revealed enlarged vessels in the telencephalon and fins,
which indicated that blood accumulation was due to dilation and
leaking of the vessels in notch3 mutant adults. Our studies of
zebrafish notch3 mutants provide evidence that Notch3 plays a
conserved role in maintaining vascular tone and vessel integrity in
TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT
Clinical issue
Mutations in the human NOTCH3 gene cause cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
CADASIL is an inherited disease characterized by progressive degeneration of
small blood vessels, which leads to a diverse set of clinical manifestations
including vasculopathy, neurodegeneration and dementia. None of the
existing CADASIL mouse models fully recapitulates the human disease. In light
of the variability among patients and the limitations of currently available
NOTCH3 and CADASIL animal models, the mechanism by which NOTCH3
mutations cause CADASIL symptoms – including vascular, white matter and
other disease phenotypes – remain to be clarified.
Results
In this study, zebrafish notch3 mutants were analyzed to gain insight into the
mechanisms underlying CADASIL pathophysiology. The authors report that
mutations in notch3 reduce the expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and
the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Despite displaying an
early neurogenic phenotype, some notch3 homozygous mutants survived to
adulthood. These mutants, as well as adult zebrafish carrying both mutant
alleles together, displayed a striking stress-associated accumulation of blood in
the head and fins. The authors’ histological analysis revealed vasculopathy in
the mutants, including enlarged vessels in the brain and peripheral circulatory
system and an apparent loss of arterial morphological structure. Moreover,
ultrastructural analysis revealed signs of vessel deterioration in notch3
mutants, including gaps in the arterial wall and the presence of blood cells
outside of vessels. Subsequent examination of Notch pathway target genes
indicated that Notch3 acts via a canonical Notch signaling pathway to
promote normal vessel structure. In notch3 heterozygotes, expression of
notch3 and its target genes was elevated, indicating that alterations in gene
expression occur in response to partial loss of Notch3.
Implications and future directions
These analyses of zebrafish notch3 mutants indicate that Notch3 regulates OPC
development and mbp gene expression in larvae, and plays a conserved role in
maintaining vascular tone and vessel integrity in adults. Changes in gene
expression and cell death in the CNS were observed specifically in notch3
heterozygotes, suggesting that a partial loss of Notch3 function could
contribute to aspects of the pathophysiology of CADASIL. These changes were
not detected using previously reported animal models that completely lack
Notch3 expression. Zebrafish notch3 mutants provide a valuable tool for future
screens aiming to identify Notch signaling modifiers that affect the phenotype,
and for studies of the activity of CADASIL mutant alleles and the signaling and
cellular mechanisms that contribute to Notch3-associated pathologies.

vertebrate adult vessels. The presence of oligodendrocyte
abnormalities before vascular pathology provides evidence that
notch3 might function in parallel in myelination and vasculogenesis.
RESULTS
Identification of mutations in notch3
In a screen for zebrafish mutants with abnormal myelination,
Pogoda et al. identified st51 as a mutation that reduced mbp
expression in the CNS at 5 dpf (Pogoda et al., 2006). Previous
mapping experiments localized the st51 mutation to linkage group
3 (Pogoda et al., 2006). To identify the gene disrupted by st51, we
conducted additional mapping experiments and localized the
mutation to an interval bordered by the simple sequence length
polymorphism (SSLP) markers Z3725 and Z20058, which contains
the notch3 gene (Woods et al., 2005). Sequence analysis of genomic
DNA from st51 mutants revealed a G-to-A transition in the
mutant allele that disrupts the splice donor site after exon 13 in
the notch3 gene (Fig. 1A). We detected no recombination between
this lesion and the st51 mutation among 348 meioses (data not
shown), indicating that st51 was tightly linked to notch3. Reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of RNA isolated from wildtype
and mutant larvae at 3 dpf revealed that the notch3 pre-mRNA
was aberrantly spliced in st51 homozygotes, such that intron 13
was retained in the majority of mutant transcripts (Fig.  1B,C).
Retention of this intron in the predominant mutant transcript
caused truncation of the predicted notch3 open reading frame in
the extracellular region, after the 17th EGF repeat (Fig.  1B). In
addition, a minority of the mutant notch3 mRNAs contained
aberrantly spliced sequences that result in partial deletions of exon
13. Sequence analysis identified two such deletions, a 15 bp deletion
that maintained the reading frame, and a 103 bp deletion that
induced a frameshift, truncating the predicted notch3 reading frame
after the 16th EGF repeat (Fig. 1B,C).
To further investigate the function of notch3, we obtained and
examined a commercially available notch3 allele, ZM_197263,
produced by insertional mutagenesis. The ZM_197263 mutation
(referred to as ‘zm’ hereafter) contains a retroviral insertion in the
5UTR of the notch3 gene, 158 nucleotides upstream of the open
reading frame (Fig. 1A). In wild-type animals, notch3 was expressed
throughout the nervous system, including in the hindbrain (Fig. 1D).
Compared with wild type (Fig.  1D,G; n=5 each), notch3st51/+ and
notch3zm/+ heterozygous siblings (Fig.  1E,H; n=11 each) and
notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig. 1F; n=7) showed enhanced expression of
notch3 in the CNS, a finding we return to below. In contrast, little
if any notch3 mRNA was detectable in notch3zm/zm mutants (Fig. 1I;
n=9), indicating that notch3zm is a strong loss-of-function mutation.

Notch3 in CNS and vascular integrity RESEARCH ARTICLE
To examine the phenotype of notch3zm/zm mutants and determine
whether st51 and zm fail to complement, we examined mbp
expression in early larvae (Fig. 1J-Q). Expression of mbp was similar
to wild type in notch3st51/+ heterozygotes (Fig. 1K), but was reduced
in the CNS of notch3st51/st51 homozygotes (Fig. 1L) and notch3zm/zm
homozygotes (Fig. 1M). The reduction of mbp expression in the
CNS of notch3zm/zm mutants, notch3st51/st51 homozygotes and
notch3st51/zm transheterozygotes at 5 dpf (Fig. 1N-Q and data not
shown) indicated that the st51 and zm mutations failed to
complement. Moreover, the reduction seemed to be more severe
in notch3zm/zm mutants, suggesting that the notch3st51 mutation
might have more residual notch3 function than does notch3zm. On
the basis of mapping data, the identification of lesions that disrupt
the splicing or expression level of notch3 and complementation
analysis, we conclude that both the st51 and zm mutations disrupt
the function of notch3. Phenotypic and molecular studies suggest
that notch3zm is a null or near-null mutation, and that notch3st51 is
a hypomorphic allele that probably retains weak notch3 function.
The residual Notch3 activity in notch3st51/st51 homozygotes is
probably provided by the minor splice variant with the 15 bp
deletion that maintains the reading frame in these mutants. These
results demonstrate that notch3 is essential for normal expression
of mbp in the larval CNS.
Transient reduction in OPCs in notch3 mutant larvae
Mutational analysis shows that notch3 is essential for normal
expression of mbp mRNA in the CNS of zebrafish larvae (Pogoda
et al., 2006) (and this work). To investigate the possibility that an
early deficit in oligodendrocytes underlies reduced mbp expression
in notch3 mutants, we examined oligodendrocyte transcription
factor 2 (olig2), which is expressed in OPCs and motor neurons
(Park et al., 2002; Park et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2003; Takebayashi
et al., 2000; Zannino and Appel, 2009). At 24 hpf, expression of
olig2 was comparable between wild type, notch3st51/+ heterozygotes
and notch3st51/st51 homozygotes (data not shown). However, olig2
expression was reduced in OPCs of notch3st51/st51 mutants at 50
hpf (Fig. 2C,C; n=5) compared with wild type (Fig. 2A,A; n=2)
and notch3st51/+ heterozygotes (Fig.  2B,B; n=8). At 52 hpf,
expression of sox10, an independent marker of cells of the
oligodendrocyte lineage, was also reduced in the midline of the
hindbrain in notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig. 2F, compared with 2D,E).
These results suggested that a partial loss of OPCs resulted in the
reduced expression of mbp in the CNS of notch3 mutants. This
analysis indicates that notch3 is required for OPC development and
myelin gene expression in the embryo and early larva. Despite these
defects at earlier stages, some notch3 mutants achieve normal levels
of mbp expression in the hindbrain by 7 dpf (data not shown).
In individuals with CADASIL, loss of myelin accompanies and
has been proposed to be caused by vascular defects (Okeda et al.,
2002), and adult notch3 knockout mice have vascular defects.
Although swim bladder inflation was delayed at 5 days postfertilization
(dpf), no overt evidence of edema or compromised
circulation was detected morphologically at 3-5 dpf (stages when
OPC defects were apparent among progeny) in notch3st51/st51 or
notch3zm/zm mutants from five independent heterozygous incrosses.
To more closely examine vessel patterning, we conducted
microangiography and crossed the notch3 mutations into the
Tg[fli1a:EGFP] background (Lawson and Weinstein, 2002b). As

Tg[fli1a:EGFP] (Fig.  2G-I and supplementary material Fig. S2)
indicated that, at the anatomical level, overall sprouting, vessel
branching and morphogenesis were intact in notch3 mutants at
stages before and after OPC deficits were already apparent.
Consistent with Tg[fli1a:EGFP] analysis and microangiography,
vascular markers [deltaC (dlC), ephrinB2 (efn2ba/ephB2), fmsrelated
tyrosine kinase 4 (flt4) and disabled homolog 2 (dab2)] were
indistinguishable between wild type, notch3zm/+ heterozygotes and
notch3zm/zm mutants at 28 hpf (supplementary material Fig. S3AL
), providing additional evidence that, at the anatomical level,
arterial venous identity and arterial venous patterning of the
vasculature is intact at stages when OPCs and oligodendrocytes
are disrupted in notch3 mutants.
Neurogenic phenotype of notch3 mutants and apoptosis in notch3
heterozygotes
To investigate whether the reduction of OPCs in notch3 mutants
was due to loss of progenitors via cell death, we used Acridine
Orange (AO) to label cells undergoing apoptosis. At 52 hpf, AO
staining was similar in the CNS of wild-type siblings (Fig. 3A; n=12)
and notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig.  3C; n=8), indicating that the
reduction of OPCs in notch3 mutants was not due to cell death.
Because apoptosis did not account for reduced OPCs in mutants,
we examined the expression of progenitor and differentiation
markers. During neuronal development, deltaD expression in
precursors prevents neighboring notch-expressing cells from
adopting neuronal fates (Haddon et al., 1998b; Hans and Campos-
Ortega, 2002; Mahler et al., 2010; Takke et al., 1999). We observed
abundant deltaD mRNA (Fig.  3D-I) in lateral regions of
notch3st51/st51 (Fig. 3F; n=11) and notch3zm/zm (Fig. 3I; n=2 at 48 hpf
and 4 at 54 hpf) mutants, with holes in deltaD expression in medial
regions similar to the gaps in notch3 and notch1a expression that
were present in notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig.  1F; n=11 and
supplementary material Fig. S4). To further investigate the
development of neural progenitors, we examined gfap expression
at 52 hpf, which marks radial glial progenitors at this stage (Fig. 3JL
). As we observed for notch3 and deltaD, there were medial gaps
in gfap expression in notch3 mutants (Fig. 3L; st51: n=8; zm: n=9),
indicating that OPCs might be reduced owing to aberrant
differentiation of medial progenitors.
To investigate the possibility that the reduction of OPCs results
from a neurogenic phenotype in notch3 mutants, we examined
HuC/D, which marks post-mitotic neurons. In contrast to wild type
(Fig. 3M) and notch3 heterozygotes (Fig. 3N and data not shown),
notch3 mutants had abundant HuC/D expression (Fig. 3O and data
not shown) and acetylated tubulin staining (compare with Fig. 3PR
) in medial regions of R3/R5, consistent with the possibility that
OPCs are reduced because progenitors are inappropriately allocated
to neuronal fates in notch3 mutants. In other regions of the
embryo, major axonal projections were comparable between wild
type and notch3 mutants (supplementary material Fig. S5).
A striking feature of the foregoing analysis is that notch3
heterozygotes expressed highly elevated levels of Notch pathway
components, including deltaD [Fig.  3E (80% of notch3st51/+
heterozygotes; n=26); Fig. 3H (n=9 notch3zm/+ heterozygotes at 48
hpf and 6 notch3zm/+ heterozygotes at 54 hpf)] and notch3 itself
(Fig. 1E), and the progenitor marker gfap (Fig. 3K). In addition, AO
staining revealed elevated cell death in the CNS of notch3st51/+
(Fig. 3B; n=12) and notch3zm/+ (n=2) heterozygotes that was not seen
in wild type or homozygous mutants (Fig. 3A, n=12; Fig. 3C, n=8).

Despite the reduced numbers of OPCs in notch3st51/st51 and
notch3zm/zm mutants, a subset of the mutants recovered from these
early zygotic phenotypes and survived to adulthood. Homozygous
notch3st51/st51 and notch3zm/zm males that survived to adulthood
were fertile. However, in response to mild stress (such as moving
the tank from the rack, or mating), the homozygous mutant adults
displayed an accumulation of blood within the head and fins that
was not observed in wild-type or heterozygous siblings (Fig. 4). In
notch3zm/+ (Fig.  4A,E) and notch3st51/+ (Fig.  4C,E) heterozygous
siblings, blood was evident at the base of the fins, but did not extend
into the caudal fin rays. In contrast, blood extended from the base
to the tip of the fins in notch3zm/zm (Fig. 4B,E) and notch3st51/st51
(Fig. 4D,E) homozygotes and notch3st51/zm transheterozygotes (data
not shown), indicating that vascular tone might be compromised
in notch3 mutant adults. As observed for the reduction in mbp
expression in the larvae, notch3zm/zm mutants showed more
pronounced phenotypes compared with notch3st51/st51 mutants.
CADASIL is a vasculopathy of small cerebral and systemic
arteries caused by mutations in NOTCH3 (Baudrimont et al., 1993;
Ruchoux et al., 1995). We conducted histopathological analysis to
investigate whether adult zebrafish notch3 mutants showed any

evidence of vasculopathy in the brain. Compared with wild-type
(Fig. 5A,B,G) and heterozygous (Fig. 5C,D,I) genotypes, vessels were
more prominent in the telencephalon of notch3zm/zm (Fig.  5E,H)
and notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig. 5F,J). In contrast, the tectum of wildtype
zebrafish had highly branched large- and small-diameter
vessels (Fig.  5A), whereas the tectum of notch3 mutants was
covered with small-diameter vessels and capillaries (Fig.  5E,F).
Histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained
sections within the medial telencephalon confirmed the presence
of small vessels (probably capillaries) traversing the tissue of
notch3zm/+ and notch3st51/+ heterozygotes (Fig. 5K,M). In contrast,
abnormally large vessels were present in notch3zm/zm and
notch3st51/st51 mutant telencephalon (Fig.  5L,N), indicative of
vasculopathy in notch3 mutant brain tissue.
Defective organization and vasodilation of vessels in notch3
mutants
To further investigate the basis for the accumulation of blood in
notch3 mutants, we conducted histological analysis of caudal fin
tissue isolated from notch3 mutants. Wild-type fins had the
expected highly ordered reiterative structure of dermal, vascular
and nervous tissues, with veins occupying the joints between and
arteries within bony regions (Fig. 6A,B; n=2). This ordered pattern
was largely intact in notch3zm/+ and notch3st51/+ heterozygotes
(Fig. 6C,E; n=2 each). By contrast, in notch3st51/st51 mutants (Fig. 6D;
n=2) veins were not limited to the joints and extended into the
bony regions, which were co-occupied by multiple distended

vessels. Similar but more severe phenotypes were observed in
notch3zm/zm mutants (Fig. 6F; n=2). Even with higher magnification,
it was difficult to unambiguously identify arteries in the notch3zm/zm
mutant fins (Fig. 6F).
In order to quantitatively assess the vessel defects given the
difficulty in distinguishing arteries from veins in notch mutants, we
determined the ratio of the vessel diameter within the bony segments
of the fin ray, where arteries are typically located, to the distance
between the bones (Fig. 6G). This ratio was not significantly different
between wild-type and notch3st51/+ or notch3zm/+ heterozygotes
(Fig. 6H). In contrast, notchst51/st51 and notch3zm/zm mutants showed
statistically significant distension of the vessels residing within bony
regions of the fin ray, such that vessels in notch3zm/zm mutants showed
a threefold increase in relative diameter.
Consistent with the vascular phenotypes of notch3 mutants,
notch3 expression was prominent in arteries of adult fin (Fig. 7A).
In notch3 mutants, the vessels within bony regions, where arteries
normally reside, showed morphological features that were more
reminiscent of veins. To investigate whether the notch3 mutant
vessels within bony segments showed aberrant morphology because
they had lost their arterial identity, we examined the expression of
deltaC, a marker of arterial identity. As in notch3zm/+ heterozygotes
(Fig.  7B), notch3zm/zm mutants (Fig.  7C) expressed deltaC in the
enlarged vessels within bony segments. Importantly, deltaC was
not expressed in the vessels that run adjacent to the bony segments,
indicating that those vessels kept their venous identity. We also
examined flt4, which was expressed in arteries and veins within
the fin of notch3zm/+ heterozygotes (Fig.  7D) and notch3zm/zm
mutants (Fig.  7E). These analyses indicate that, although the
mutant arteries displayed morphological features of veins, their
arterial identity was intact in notch3zm/zm mutants.
Previous studies of mouse Notch3 knockout mice suggest distinct
mechanisms by which Notch3 functions. One proposed mechanism
involves the regulation of canonical Notch targets such as Hey and
Hes genes (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008), whereas the second
points to a newly identified pathway whereby Notch3 activates
unknown targets (Domenga et al., 2004). Moreover, human
CADASIL mutations show a differing ability to bind Jagged1 ligand
and to activate canonical Notch targets (e.g. RBP-Jκ) (Joutel et al.,
2004). To investigate the pathway underlying compromised vascular
tone in zebrafish notch3 mutants, we surveyed the expression of
canonical Notch targets in mutant fins (Fig. 7F,G). We found that
the canonical notch target hey1 was significantly reduced in
notch3zm/zm and notch3st51/st51 mutant fins (Fig. 7F), and that levels
of her9 were not significantly changed (Fig. 7G). These results indicate
that Notch3 acts via a mechanism that involves the activation of
canonical Notch targets to promote vascular tone and integrity.
Compromised vessel integrity leads to hemorrhage of vessels in
notch3 mutants
To investigate whether the accumulation of blood in the fins of notch3
mutants was due to compromised vascular tone or reflected a more

severe defect (hemorrhaging of the vessels), we used EM to examine
the vascular ultrastructure. In wild type (Fig. 7H,I) and notch3zm/+
heterozygotes (Fig.  7J,K), arteries and veins were readily
distinguishable, albeit that veins seemed to be larger in notch3zm/+
heterozygotes, suggesting a mild defect in vascular tone. In
notch3zm/zm mutants the vessels were severely dilated and arteries
were difficult to distinguish from veins (Fig.  7L,M and data not
shown). Mural cells associated with vessels were easily identifiable
in wild-type and heterozygous genotypes, but could not be
unambiguously identified in notch3 mutants. Moreover, gaps in the
vessel walls and the presence of blood cells outside of the vessels
indicated that the pooling of blood in the fins of notch3zm/zm mutants
was probably due to both loss of vascular tone and hemorrhage of
the notch3 mutant vessels (compare Fig. 7N and 7O).
DISCUSSION
The Notch pathway is highly conserved and is widely used to
mediate cell fate decisions in embryonic and adult tissues (reviewed
in Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). Mutations disrupting human NOTCH3
cause CADASIL, an inherited small vessel disease associated with
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline with advanced patient age
(Hervé and Chabriat, 2010). Prevailing models indicate that
cognitive decline might be secondary to vascular pathology, but
this remains an open question because the existing mouse knockins
of common patient NOTCH3 alleles recapitulate some but not
all of the CADASIL pathologies. The two reported Notch3 knockout
mouse models are susceptible to stroke when challenged, but no
other neural deficits have been reported. Studies of these knockout
mouse mutants point to opposing models of Notch3 function in
establishing vascular structure. Based on their analysis of one
knockout mutation, Domenga et al. presented evidence for a
vascular defect and argue for a non-canonical mechanism
(Domenga et al., 2004), whereas Arboleda-Velasquez et al. did not
report vascular structure defects in a different knockout strain and
argued that a canonical pathway was important for the regulation
of gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
(Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011; Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008).
Although the mouse analyses present different views of the role of
notch3 in establishing vascular structure, our analysis of zebrafish
notch3 mutants provides strong evidence that notch3 has a
conserved function in sustaining mature vessel structure and
maintaining vascular integrity, probably via a canonical pathway,
as indicated by reduced hey1 in notch3 mutants. In addition, our
studies of zebrafish notch3 mutants provide evidence that notch3
regulates OPC development and mbp gene expression in larvae and
promotes mural cell and artery maturation in adults. Our analysis
of neural development reveal that notch3 mutant larvae have a
neurogenic phenotype and that notch3 heterozygous larvae have
abnormalities in development of the CNS that are not seen in
homozygous mutants.
We demonstrate that notch3 is essential for normal differentiation
of neural progenitors during embryogenesis. In the developing
hindbrain of notch3 mutants, there were prominent gaps in the
expression of neural progenitor markers, and excess neurons
developed at the expense of OPCs. When Notch signaling is
disrupted, excess neurons often differentiate at early stages at the
expense of later-born cell types, including OPCs (Bingham et al.,
2003; Haddon et al., 1998a; Itoh et al., 2003; Park et al., 2000; Shih
and Keller, 1992). In the zebrafish embryo, Qiu et al. reported that
Notch3 and Notch1a have redundant functions in controlling
hindbrain patterning and neurogenesis (Qiu et al., 2009). They
found that excess neurons developed in notch1a mutants that also
had reduced notch3 function (via morpholino injection), and
rhombomere boundaries were not maintained. In combination, our
analysis and the results of Qiu et al. suggest that notch3 mutants
have reduced OPCs in the early larval stage because of misallocation
of the fates of some early neural progenitors (Qiu et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the relatively mild and transient notch3 mutant
phenotype might reflect redundancy with notch1a. It is possible
that, in the mouse, Notch3 has a similar role in OPC development
that is masked by overlapping functions of other notch genes.
The elevated expression of notch3, deltaD and gfap and increased
apoptosis in the CNS of notch3 heterozygotes was a striking
finding of our analysis. The elevation of progenitor markers
suggests that the differentiation of some progenitors might be
delayed by the partial reduction of Notch signaling in notch3
heterozygotes. The elevated cell death in the heterozygotes suggests
that some of these delayed progenitors undergo apoptosis, but the
majority must differentiate properly because the pattern of neurons
and OPCs is apparently normal and the fish are fully viable. The
finding of changes in gene expression and cell death in the CNS
specific to notch3 heterozygotes suggests that a partial loss of
Notch3 function could contribute to aspects of the pathophysiology
of CADASIL that have not been observed in animals that
completely lack notch3 function.
Based largely on the temporal manifestation and detection of
phenotypes, leukoaraiosis, subcortical ischemic events, mood
disturbances, apathy and dementia have been thought to be
secondary to vascular defects and reduced capillary density
(reviewed in Hervé and Chabriat, 2010; Kalimo et al., 2002; Pantoni,
2010). Analysis of zebrafish cloche mutants, which lack endothelium
but have normal hindbrain neuron clusters and axon tracts,
provides evidence that endothelium is not required for proper
patterning and organization of neurons in the early hindbrain
(Ulrich et al., 2011). In zebrafish notch3 mutants, OPCs are already
reduced at stages when gross vascular patterning is intact, as
assessed by the Tg[fli1a:EGFP] transgene, microangiography and
endothelial markers. In addition, the OPC deficits are evident at
stages when the other cell type of the vessel, the mural cell, has not
been specified or undergone maturation (Miano et al., 2006;
Santoro et al., 2009). Taken together, this indicates that notch3 is
likely to have parallel roles in regulating OPC development and
mbp gene expression in larvae, and in promoting vascular integrity.
Future investigation is required to identify the notch3 targets
involved in the abnormalities in OPC development and
vasculopathy in brain and peripheral tissues, and to determine
whether the brain phenotypes involve communication between
neural and vascular cells, which has been proposed to account for
the non-autonomous neuropathology in CADASIL phenotypes.
Alternatively, in mouse and zebrafish, notch3 is expressed widely
in neural progenitors (Irvin et al., 2001; Lindsell et al., 1996; Qiu
et al., 2009); therefore, the effects might instead be later
manifestations of a notch3 function in neural development rather
than a secondary consequence of vascular defects.
Some zebrafish notch3 mutants survive to adulthood. This is
probably due to compensation by other notch family members such

as notch1a, because adult mutants that are homozygous even for
the presumed null notch3zm allele were recovered. Those notch3
mutants that do survive show enlarged vessels in the telencephalon
and accumulation of blood in peripheral vessels along the rostral
caudal axis (in particular within the pectoral, anal and caudal fins),
indicating loss of vascular tone within peripheral vessels.
Cardiovascular development in zebrafish, as in mammals, involves
specification of endothelial cell fates during the earliest stages of
vessel development. Arterial differentiation is regulated by Shh,
vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and Notch signaling in
zebrafish and in other vertebrates (Lawson et al., 2001; Lawson et
al., 2002; Lawson and Weinstein, 2002a; Torres-Vázquez et al., 2003;
Weinstein and Lawson, 2002). Complete loss of Notch signaling,
as occurs in mutants for mindbomb (mib), an E3 ubiquitin ligase
involved in Notch activation, results in deficits of arterial-specific
and ectopic vein marker expression within the dorsal aorta (Lawson
et al., 2002). Arterial and venous fates are intact in notch3 mutant
embryos and in adults, indicating that Notch3 is not involved or
that other notch genes compensate for its loss.
In addition to endothelial cell specification, cardiovascular
development in mammals and zebrafish involves recruitment of
vascular mural cells (vMCs) during a process known as vascular
myogenesis (Miano et al., 2006; Owens, 1995; Owens, 1998; Owens
et al., 2004; Owens and Wise, 1997; Santoro et al., 2009). vMCs,
VSMCs and pericytes initially act as support cells, but subsequently
become highly specialized cells that control vasodilation and vessel
caliber. During larval development in zebrafish, immature VSMCs
are detected adjacent to the dorsal aorta by ultrastructural criteria
and marker expression (Miano et al., 2006; Santoro et al., 2009).
However, differentiated VSMCs are only apparent after 1 month
of development, and definitive VSMCs, defined by dense plaques
(hallmarks of a mature actin cytoskeleton), myofilament bundles
and a basement membrane, are only apparent at 3 months (Miano
et al., 2006; Santoro et al., 2009). Histological and ultrastructural
analyses revealed vasodilation of both peripheral arteries and veins
of notch3 mutants, indicating that notch3, which is expressed in
the walls of both vessel types, has an essential role in limiting
vasodilation. Vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and
relaxation regulate vessel caliber and local blood pressure in
response to demand for oxygenated blood. Differentiated VSMCs
display contractile properties, whereas undifferentiated VSMCs are
proliferative (Owens, 1995). Pooling of blood and vasodilation in
notch3 mutants are consistent with a role for notch3 in promoting
the mature, contractile VSMC state to regulate vascular tone. notch3
seems to play an additional role in regulating arterial architecture,
because vessels positioned where arteries are typically located had
thinner vessel walls, a morphology resembling that of veins rather
than the typical thick cell walls of arteries, despite normal arterial
venous patterning in vessels of embryos and adults. The absence
of obvious patterning defects in embryos is consistent with adultonset
vasculopathy due to defective VSMC maturation or function
in notch3 mutants. Mural cells and VSMCs both contribute to the
normal vascular response to Vegf in newly forming vessels and
during regeneration (Carmeliet and Collen, 1999; Carmeliet and
Storkebaum, 2002). We were unable to detect definitive pericytes
associated with vessels in bony regions of mutant fin rays (where
arteries reside in wild type); thus, impaired pericyte development
or recruitment might contribute to impaired vascular integrity.
Similarly, VSMC destruction associated with reduced pericytes has
been reported in individuals with CADASIL (Kalimo et al., 2002;
Ruchoux et al., 2003). Thus, zebrafish notch3 mutant phenotypes
show aspects of CADASIL pathology, specifically compromised
VSMC and vascular integrity despite the different nature of the
mutations in notch3.
Two Notch3 knockout mice have been reported. In contrast to
the sub-viable zebrafish mutants, both mouse knockout models are
viable and fertile (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008; Domenga et al.,
2004; Kitamoto et al., 2005; Krebs et al., 2003). One Notch3 knockout
shows deficits in differentiation and maturation of VSMCs of small
systemic vessels (Domenga et al., 2004). Similar to zebrafish notch3
mutants, the tail arteries of this Notch3 knockout are enlarged with
a thin media reminiscent of veins. Domenga et al. suggested that
Notch3 might act through a non-canonical pathway in VSMCs,
because expression of classical Notch targets such as Hes genes were
normal in Notch3 mutants (Domenga et al., 2004). Instead, they
hypothesized that Notch3 acts as a luminal pressure gauge or sensor
that modulates the myogenic contractile response via regulation of
the actin cytoskeleton (Domenga et al., 2004). In the second mouse
knockout, ultrastructural vessel defects were not reported, but
transcriptional profiling of purified populations of cerebral VSMCs
did show deficits in regulators of muscle contraction, including
regulators of cell motility and architecture and modest reductions
of some canonical Notch targets, such as Hes1 and Hey1 in isolated
VSMCs (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008). Notably, the resting
cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both Notch3 mice was normal, but
middle cerebral artery occlusion led to an exacerbated stroke
phenotype. Specifically, CBF defects and more frequent ischemic
lesions without vasoconstriction were observed, thus supporting a
role for Notch3 in regulating contractile tone in cerebral vessels
(Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011; Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008;
Ayata, 2010; Domenga et al., 2004; Krebs et al., 2003). Similarly,
evidence of compromised vascular tone and accumulation of blood
in vessels in zebrafish notch3 mutants was prominent in response
to mild stress, but difficult to detect otherwise. Thus, notch3 seems
to have a conserved function in vascular myogenesis and vessel
maturation via a mechanism involving canonical Notch pathway
targets. Notably, in both zebrafish and mammals, VSMC
differentiation is a Notch3-dependent process that occurs during
post-larval (zebrafish) and postnatal (mammals) development. In
contrast to mouse knockouts, some of the zebrafish notch3 mutants
do not survive to adulthood, perhaps owing to incomplete recovery
from early CNS defects.
In summary, we have identified mutations disrupting notch3 that
cause oligodendrocyte deficits in embryos and vascular pathology
in brain and peripheral tissues of adults, revealing roles for Notch3
in glia and vascular cells. It is thus possible that early glial deficits
also contribute to white matter defects in individuals with CADASIL.
Although arterial and venous fates are properly specified in embryos
and adults, the fin vessels of adults show morphologies that are typical
of veins. Moreover, adult vessels are swollen and show evidence of
compromised vascular tone, including vasodilation and hemorrhage.
Zebrafish notch3 mutants will be valuable for future screens to
identify Notch signaling modifiers or risk factors affecting the
phenotype, and for studies of the activity of CADASIL mutant alleles
and the signaling and cellular mechanisms contributing to vascular
and other Notch3-associated pathologies.

Ethics statement
The animal work performed in this study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of Albert Einstein College of Medicine
and Stanford University School of Medicine.
Fish strains, mapping and positional cloning
Fish strains
Zebrafish embryos were raised at 28.5°C and staged according to
Kimmel et al. (Kimmel et al., 1995). Identification of the st51
mutation has been described (Pogoda et al., 2006). The notch3zm
allele was purchased from Znomics.
Genetic mapping
Wild-type and notch3st51 mutant larvae were sorted based on their
mbp expression at 5 dpf. The map position of notch3st51 was refined
by scoring SSLP markers from linkage group 3 (LG3) in notchst51
mapping crosses as described (Talbot and Schier, 1999). These
mapping studies localized the notch3st51 mutation to a region
defined by the markers Z3725 and Z20058, which also contained
the notch3 gene (Woods et al., 2005). We sequenced the notch3
gene to find the lesion.
Genotyping
To genotype the notch3 alleles, individual larvae and adults were
anesthetized in Tricaine as described and genomic DNA was
prepared from adult fin samples or whole embryos and larvae
(Westerfield, 1995).
The notch3st51 allele was scored using the following primers to
amplify fragments from genomic DNA: forward: 5-GAGT -
GCCAGT CGAATCCCTGTC-3; reverse: 5-ACACTTGCAGGT -
GAAA CCATTGAGC-3. The PCR product was digested with RsaI,
which cuts the wild-type product but not the mutant.
Two different assays were used to genotype the notch3zm allele.
In early experiments, we scored notch3zm by performing two
separate PCR assays on each genomic DNA sample. One set of
primers (5-ACTCCGATCCGAAGTGAAGTAG-3 and 5-
CAGGCAATCACATTAGGATGAA-3) amplified a 184 bp
product from the wild-type allele but no product from the mutant
allele. The second set (5-CTGAAGCCTATAGAGTACGAGCC-
3 and 5-GTCCGAGCTGCAGAAGGAAATACTG-3) amplified
a product of about 700 bp from the mutant allele but no product
from the wild-type allele. In more recent experiments, the following
three primers were combined in single PCR reaction to genotype
the notch3zm mutation: Common F 5-GTCCGAGCTGCAG -
AAGGAAATACTG-3, ZM R 5-CTGTGCCTTATTTGAA -
CTAACC-3 and WT R 5-GTGGAAACTCGATCCTACTCC-3.
A 283 nt product was amplified from the mutant allele, whereas
the wild-type product was 190 nt.
RT-PCR
To examine the notch3 mRNA in notch3st51 mutants, RNA was
prepared from the body of individual 3-day-old embryos using the
Qiagen Rneasy Micro Kit. cDNA was synthesized using the
SuperScript II First-Strand System (Invitrogen) with random
hexamer primers following the manufacturer’s protocol. The tail
of each embryo was used for genotyping as described above. PCR
for notch3 was performed on cDNAs with primers flanking the
lesion site: forward 5-GCACTTCAGGTACCAACTGTGA-3
(across exons 11 and 12) and reverse 5-AGAGCAAGGT -
GTGAGCAGTTCT-3 (from exon 15). The different PCR products
from wild-type, heterozygote and mutant cDNAs were run on an
agarose gel and then cloned and sequenced. As a control, ef1a was
analyzed as described (Monk et al., 2009).
For examination of Notch target expression, total RNA was
isolated from wild-type and mutant fins and larvae at the specified
stages using TRIZOL according to standard protocols. cDNA was
reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and oligodT primers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To control for genomic DNA contamination, reverse
transcriptase was omitted using the same RNA samples. The
following primers were used for qRT-PCR: hey1f 5-

qRT-PCR was performed using an Eppendorf Realplex3 machine
according to standard protocols and cycling conditions. For zm
genotypes: n=2 biological replicates and 3 technical replicates; for
st51 genotypes: n=5 biological and 3 technical replicates. Percent
of wild-type expression was calculated using the ∆∆CT method
using ef1a as the standard and wild type as the reference. T-test
was calculated using Excel (Microsoft).
In situ hybridization
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described
previously (Thisse and Thisse, 1998), except that for analysis of
vascular markers and fins BM purple AP (Roche) was used as the
substrate for alkaline phosphatase. To generate the notch3 probe, a
region of the gene corresponding to bp 14 to 935 of the notch3 cDNA
(GenBank accession number AF152001) was cloned into the pCRIITOPO
vector; the plasmid was digested with EcoRV and transcribed
with SP6 RNA polymerase. mbp (Lyons et al., 2005), olig2 (Park et
al., 2002), sox10 (Dutton et al., 2001), deltaD (Haddon et al., 1998b),
flt4 (Lawson et al., 2002), efnb2a (Durbin et al., 1998), deltaC
(Smithers et al., 2000), dab2 (Song et al., 2004) and notch1a (Bierkamp
and Campos-Ortega, 1993) probes were prepared as previously
described. For gfap, an 899 bp fragment of the gene was amplified
from 72 hpf larval cDNA using the following primers: gfap1: 5-
GAGATGATGGGGCTAAACGA-3; gfap2: 5 -TCCAGCAGCT -
TCCTGTAGGT-3. The fragment was inserted into the TopoII
(Invitrogen) vector; antisense probe was made by cleaving with XbaI
and transcribing with SP6 RNA polymerase. For fin vessel analysis
using notch3 and deltaC probes, linear templates were amplified from
cDNA using the following primers: T7-notch3F 5-TAATAC -

Notch3 in CNS and vascular integrity RESEARCH ARTICLE
antibody (Jackson, 715-095-151)] and HuC/D (Molecular Probes)
immunostainings were carried out as described previously (Lyons
et al., 2008). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM confocal, Zeiss
Observer equipped with Apotome, Perkin-Elmer spinning disk
confocal or Leica SP2 confocal microscope. After imaging, larvae
were genotyped for the notch3 mutation.
Apoptosis was assessed via AO staining as described previously
(Lyons et al., 2005).
Tg[fli-EGFP] transgenic larvae at the specified stages were
visualized and imaged live or were fixed in 4% PFA and GFP signals
were detected using an anti-GFP antibody. Briefly, 51-52 hpf embryos
were fixed overnight (O/N) in 4% PFA and then dehydrated in MeOH
via 25%/50%/75% MeOH in PBS. Larvae were rehydrated, treated
with 10 ng/μl Proteinase K in PBSTri (PBS, 0.5% for Triton X-100)
for 30 minutes and postfixed for 20 minutes in 4% PFA. Following
washes with PBSTri, the embryos were preincubated for 3 hours in
blocking buffer [10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% DMSO in
PBSTri] before incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of chicken anti-
GFP antibody (Invitrogen, A10262) in blocking buffer O/N at 4°C.
The next day the embryos were washed with PBSTri and
preincubated for 3 hours in blocking buffer. Following incubation
O/N at 4°C with a 1:300 dilution of Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat
anti-chicken antibody (Jackson, 103-545-155) in blocking buffer,
immunostained embryos were washed and then mounted in 1% low
melting point agarose (Sigma, A9414) in a glass-bottom dish. Dorsal
view images were obtained with a Leica SP2 confocal. After imaging,
larvae were genotyped for the notch3 mutation.
Microangiography
Anesthetized 2-dpf progeny from clutches of notch3zm/+
intercrosses were embedded in 1% low melting point agarose and
3-4 nl of 1% Fluorescein dextran (Invitrogen, D-1822) was injected
into the sinus venosus, essentially as described previously
(Weinstein et al., 1995). After injection, the larvae were cut out of
the agarose and remounted under anesthesia (Tricaine) in 1% low
melting point agarose on a glass bottom dish. The labeled
vasculature was imaged in 60-63 hpf larvae using a Leica SP2
confocal microscope. After imaging, larvae were genotyped for the
notch3 mutation.
Histology and transmission electron microscopy
Adults were anesthetized and the brains were dissected and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 10-μm sagittal
sections were cut on a microtome, deparaffinized, and stained with
H&E.
Fins from wild-type and notch3 mutants were clipped according
to standard protocols and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, postfixed with
1% osmium tetroxide followed by 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol and embedded in LX112 resin
(LADD Research Industries, Burlington, VT). Ultrathin sections
(80 nM) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut UCT, stained with uranyl
acetate followed by lead citrate and viewed on a JEOL 1200EX
transmission electron microscope at 80 kv.
Toluidine-blue-stained sections (1 μM) were coated with permount
solution, coverslipped, and images were acquired with an Axioskop2
microscope and Axiocam CCD camera (Zeiss). Images were
processed in ImageJ, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
Quantification of vessel defects
The circumference of vessels within the bony regions of the fin
rays (i.e. where arteries are positioned in wild type) was traced
and the diameter was determined using ImageJ software. The
distance between bony segments was measured using ImageJ (as
depicted in Fig. 5A). The ratio of the artery/vessel diameter to
length between the bone segments was calculated and plotted
using Excel (Microsoft). ANOVA analysis was performed 
using the calculator at http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/
anova_pnp_NGROUP_form.html.
