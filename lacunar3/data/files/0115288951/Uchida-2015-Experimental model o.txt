Small subcortical infarcts account for 25% of all ischemic strokes. Although once
considered to be a small vessel disease with a favorable outcome, recent studies have
reported relatively poor long-term prognoses following small subcortical infarcts. Limited
pre-clinical modeling has hampered understanding of the etiology and development of
treatments for this disease. Therefore, we attempted to develop a new experimental model
of small subcortical infarcts in mice to investigate pathophysiological changes in the
corticospinal tract and assess long-term behavioral performance. The vasoconstrictor
peptide, endothlin-1 (ET-1), in combination with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-
nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), were injected into the internal capsule of mice.
Histological and behavioral tests were performed 0–8 weeks after the injection. The ET-1/LNAME
injection resulted in severe neurological deficits that continued for up to 8 weeks.
The loss of axons and myelin surrounded by reactive gliosis was identified in the region of
the injection, in which the vasoconstriction of microvessels was also observed. Moreover, a
tract-tracing study revealed an interruption in axonal flow at the internal capsule. The
present model of small subcortical infarcts is unique and novel due to the reproduction of
neurological deficits that continue for a long period, up to 8 weeks, as well as the use of
mice as experimental animals. The reproducibility, simplicity, and easy adoptability make

1. Introduction
Small subcortical infarcts account for 25% of all ischemic
strokes (Sudlow and Warlow, 1997). Small subcortical infarcts
(o15 mm diameter) are normally located in the basal ganglia,
thalamus, internal capsule, corona radiata, and brainstem,
and have been attributed to the occlusion of a single perforating
artery (Fisher, 1982). Although patients with small
subcortical infarcts have a more favorable functional outcome
than patients with other subtypes of stroke, damage to
the white matter including the corticospinal tract contributes
to severe disabilities in spite of the small lesion size. Recent
studies demonstrated that the long-term prognosis after
small subcortical infarcts was not benign (Jackson and
Sudlow, 2005; Norrving, 2003). The percentage of patients
with small subcortical infarcts that are dependent is as high
as 18–33% at 1 year, 36% at 2 years, and 42% at 3 years
(Norrving, 2003). Thus, preclinical studies using animal models
that mimic human small subcortical infarcts would
undoubtedly be valuable to improve understanding of the
disease in humans and develop treatments.
In contrast to large artery occlusive ischemic stroke, the lack
of information on the pathophysiological events associated
with small subcortical infarcts makes this stroke subtype
particularly difficult to model (Sozmen et al., 2012). Although
several clinically relevant models have been suggested such as
the injection of a vasoconstrictor peptide (Frost et al., 2006 ;
Sozmen et al., 2009), the anterior choroidal artery occlusion
method (He et al., 1999; Tanaka et al., 2008), or systemic
hypertension model (Fredriksson et al., 1985), these methods
only partly mimic the features of human small subcortical
infarcts (Bailey et al., 2009). In addition, long-lasting neurological
deficits, which are mandatory to assess the therapeutic
effects of novel treatments, are lacking in previous studies
(Bailey et al., 2009). Moreover, few studies have used mice as
experimental animals for small subcortical infarcts in spite of
the availability of sequence data, antibodies, and geneticallymodified strains (Sozmen et al., 2012). The limitations associated
with small subcortical infarct models in previous studies
indicate that a more useful and simpler model may be needed
for further investigations on small subcortical infarcts.
Endothlin-1 (ET-1) is a naturally produced vascular endothelial
cell peptide that exhibits strong vasoconstrictive effects
(Yanagisawa et al., 1988). On the other hand, N(G)-nitro-L-
arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) is known to reduce the effects
of injury-induced nitric oxide synthase, which causes vasodilation
(Chataigneau et al., 1999; Horie et al., 2008). This study
investigated whether an injection of ET-1 in combination with
L-NAME into the internal capsule, in which descending fibers
from the motor cortex and ascending fibers to the somatosensory
cortex exist, caused focal white matter strokes in mice.
This model was used for a comprehensive analysis of small
subcortical infarcts, including long-term neurological assessments
and histological, immunohistochemical, and
physiological evaluations of corticospinal tract deformations
to clarify the characteristic features of white matter strokes.
2. Results
2.1. Physiological parameters
No significant differences were observed in the physiological
parameters between the phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-injected
control and ET-1/L-NAME-injected groups (Table 1). Body weights
did not significantly change during the 8 weeks after the
injection in either of the two groups (Fig. 1A). No premature
death occurred during and after the surgical procedures.
2.2. Long-lasting deterioration of behavioral performance
induced by the ET-1/L-NAME injection
Wefirst investigated the effects of the ET-1/L-NAME injection on
behavioral performance. We injected PBS or ET-1/L-NAME into
the posterior limb of the internal capsule, in which descending
fibers from the motor cortex and ascending fibers to the
somatosensory cortex exist (Fig. 1B). Neurological performance
was monitored for 8 weeks post-injection using the corner test
and cylinder test to assess sensorimotor function (Fig. 1C, D).
The PBS injection induced no neurological deficits at any time
points in either test. On the other hand, ET1/L-NAME injection
significantly deteriorated the behavioral scores in the corner
test from 4.5 h to 8 weeks after the injection. Furthermore, the
cylinder test revealed that behavioral scores were significantly
lower in the ET-1/L-NAME-injected group than in the PBS-
injected control group 4.5 h, 1 day, and 1, 4 and 8 weeks postinjection.
Taken together, these results indicated that the injection
of ET-1 in combination with L-NAME in the posterior limb of
the internal capsule resulted in long-lasting significant neurological
deficits in mice.

2.3. White matter injury after the ET-1/L-NAME injection
We next determined whether a co-injection of ET-1 and
L-NAME into the posterior limb of the internal capsule could
produce focal ischemic lesions in the white matter (Fig. 2A, B,
C). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (diffusion-weight imaging
), performed 1 day after ET-1/L-NAME injection, revealed
a high signal intensity lesion at the posterior limb of the
internal capsule (Fig. 2A). In the PBS-injected control group,
Luxol fast blue staining showed no myelin degradation at the
posterior limb of the internal capsule (data not shown).
Immunofluorescence with glialfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(an astrocytic marker), glutathione S-transferase Pi (GST-pi)
(an oligodendrocytic marker), and SMI-31 (an axonal marker)
demonstrated normal findings for oligodendrocytes, astrocytes
, and axons in the internal capsule (Fig. 2C), indicating
negligible mechanical injury with stereotaxic injection procedures.
In contrast, Luxol fast blue staining showed the focal
absence of myelin at the posterior limb of the internal
capsule 8 weeks after ET-1/L-NAME injection (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, fluorescent staining with GFAP, GST-pi, and
SMI-31, 8 weeks after the ET-1/L-NAME injection, revealed
the lack of staining at the site of the ET-1/L-NAME injection
(Fig. 2C). The immunologically-absent lesion was circumscribed
and surrounded by GFAP-positive cells, suggesting
focal damage caused by the ET-1/L-NAME injection and the
presence of a glial scar. Of the 38 ET-1/L-NAME-injected mice,
29 mice demonstrated the formation of infarcts and 9 mice
failed to show infarcts. We also measured infarct sizes in
Luxol fast blue staining sections. The average diameter of
lesions was 0.8370.099 mm. Next, immunofluorescent staining
with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (a
microglial marker) was performed 1 day, and 1 and 8 weeks
after ET-1/L-NAME injection to search the inflammatory
response after the induction of infarct. In contrast to few
Iba1-positive cells 1 day post-injection, a substantial number
of the Iba1-positive cells were observed at the ischemic core
1 and 8 weeks after ET-1/L-NAME injection. These results
indicated that the ET-1/L-NAME injection induced the degeneration
of three neural components consisting of neurons,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the posterior limb of the
internal capsule, thereby mimicking white matter stroke
in human.

2.4. ET-1/L-NAME-mediated vasoconstriction of the small
vessels in the internal capsule
To identify the mechanisms underlying the formation of
infarcts with the ET-1/L-NAME injection, we examined the
morphological and functional findings of small vessels penetrating
the deep white matter. Lectin was administered into the
jugular vein to show perfusing vessels in the posterior limb of
the internal capsule 1 h after the injection of ET-1/L-NAME
(Fig. 3). Fluorescent staining with platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) (an endothelial marker) in the
posterior limb of the internal capsule revealed that a large
number of PECAM-1-positive vessels were negative for lectin in
the ET-1/L-NAME-injected group, whereas all PECAM-1-positive

vessels were positive for lectin in the PBS-injected control
group. These results suggested that ET-1/L-NAME-mediated
vasoconstriction of the small vessels in the internal capsule
may be responsible for the formation of ischemic lesions.
2.5. Temporal profile of small vessel perfusion after the
ET-1/L-NAME injection
To examine whether the reperfusion of small vessels
occurred after ET-1/L-NAME-mediated vasoconstriction, the
density of lectin-perfused vessels in the posterior limb of the
internal capsule was analyzed 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week after the
injection of PBS or ET-1/L-NAME. Perfused blood vessel density
was significantly lower (by 50%) in the ET-1/L-NAME-
injected group than in the PBS-injected control group 1 h
post-injection (Fig. 4A, B). Moreover, this decrease in the
density of lectin-perfused vessels continued for up to 1 day
(65%) as well as 1 week (85%) post-injection. These results
indicated that small vessel occlusion mediated by the ET-1/
L-NAME injection was not canceled with time.
2.6. Disconnection of the corticospinal tract by ET-1/
L-NAME-induced ischemic lesions
We next investigated, using an anterograde tracing technique,
whether ET-1/L-NAME-induced ischemic lesions in the posterior
limb of the internal capsule blocked axonal flow in the
corticospinal tract. Only the axons of first-order neurons in
the corticospinal tract could be visualized because dextran was
injected into the motor cortex. The dorsal funiculus of the
cervical spinal cord was analyzed to assess corticospinal tract
disconnection 8 weeks after the ET-1/L-NAME injection. In PBS-
injected control group, dextran-labeled fiber was found
normally in the dorsal funiclus. In contrast, dextran-labeled
fiber density was significantly lower in the ET-1/L-NAME-
injected group than in the PBS-injected control group (Fig. 5A,
B). To further assess corticospinal tract degeneration with the
ET-1/
L-NAME injection, fluorescent staining with SMI-31 was performed
8 weeks post-injection. In PBS-injected control group,
there is no corticospinal tract degeneration. In contrast, the
number of SMI-31-labeled fibers was significantly lower in the
ET-1/L-NAME-injected group than in the PBS-injected control
group (Fig. 5A, C). Taken together, these results demonstrated
that ET-1/L-NAME-induced ischemic lesions destroyed and disconnected
the corticospinal tract at the posterior limb of the
internal capsule.
3. Discussion
We herein showed that the ET-1/L-NAME injection into the
posterior limb of the internal capsule produced white matter
strokes in mice, which may potentially mimic human small
subcortical infarcts. The main findings of this study are as
follows: (i) the ET-1/L-NAME injection resulted in severe and
long-lasting neurological deficits that continued for up to
8 weeks; (ii) the ET-1/L-NAME injection damaged the three
main cell components in the central nervous system (neurons
, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) at the injection site;
(iii) the histological damage caused by the ET-1/L-NAME
injection was circumscribed and was surrounded by a glial
scar; (iv) severe vasoconstriction of the small vessels penetrating
the internal capsule was induced by the ET-1/L-NAME
injection. The present model of small subcortical infarcts is
especially unique and novel due to the reproduction of
Fig. 3 – Endothelin-1 (ET-1)/N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-mediated vasoconstriction of the small vessels in the
internal capsule. Perfusing vessels were labeled by a jugular vein injection of lectin (red) 1 h after the PBS or ET-1/L-NAME
injection. Fluorescent staining with 40,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue) and PECAM-1 (an endothelial marker) (green)

neurological deficits that continue for a long period, up to
8 weeks, as well as the use of mice as experimental animals.
One of the most importantfindings of the present study is
the long-lasting neurological deficits observed after the ET-1/
L-NAME injection. Although more than 40 previous studies
examined animal models of small subcortical infarcts, few
performed detailed neurological assessments (Bailey et al.,
2009). Moreover, the significant preservation of neurological
deficits for more than 2 weeks after the induction of strokes
was extremely rare in previous studies (Janowski et al., 2008).
The lack of measurable neurological deficits at the subacute
and chronic stage of strokes may be due to the sensitivity of
the scoring system (Tanaka et al., 2008). Another possible
reason may be the sparing of sensorimotorfibers, which may
strongly depend on the location of the lesions produced (Frost
et al., 2006). It is also possible that experimental animals can
spontaneous recovery from white matter injury over time. In
the present study, neurological deficits could be measured for
up to 8 weeks after the induction of strokes. These longlasting
deficits may have been obtained because we injected
ET-1/L-NAME into the posterior limb of the internal capsule,
which accounts for a relatively rostral part in the corticospinal
tract. Posterior lesions typically result in greater deficits,
at least in human stroke patients (Wenzelburger et al., 2005).
Because significant long-lasting neurological deficits are
mandatory to assess the therapeutic effects of new treatments
, our experimental model may be of great use in preclinical
studies.
Although a series of studies showed that the intracerebral
injection of ET-1 successfully produced large ischemic lesions
in rats (Frost et al., 2006; Gilmour et al., 2004; Windle et al.,
2006), ET-1 appears to be significantly less potent in mice
(Horie et al., 2008). In line with these previous findings, we
failed to induce an ischemic lesion by injecting ET-1 alone in
the preliminary study (data not shown). This large discrepancy
in the ability of ET-1 to produce ischemic lesions
between mice and rats may be explained by differences in
the expression of the endothelin receptor isoforms (Horie
et al., 2008). In contrast to the ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictive
effects associated with the endothelin-A receptor (Zhou et al.,
2004), the endothelin-B receptor contributes to vasodilation
by releasing nitric oxide and prostacyclin from endothelial
cells (Webb et al., 1998). The mouse brain expresses twice as
many of endothelin-B receptors than endothelin-A receptors
(Wiley and Davenport, 2004). Therefore, the administration of
ET-1 could have a predominantly vasodilatory effect in mice.

In the present study, we used L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase
inhibitor, to inhibit the production of nitric oxide, in combination
with ET-1 to induce ischemic lesions in mice.
Although the lesion size was still minimal, this combination
approach succeeded in producing a stable ischemic lesion
size along with severe neurological deficits.
While ET-1 is now being widely used by an increasing
number of investigators in order to produce cortical and
subcortical infarcts in animals, histological changes have
not yet been demonstrated in vasoconstricted vessels after
the ET-1 injection (Bailey et al., 2009). Using the perfusion of
lectin for a functional analysis (vascular perfusion) and
PECAM-1 staining for a morphological analysis (presence of
vessels), we demonstrated for the first time that the ET-1/
L-NAME injection elicited the vasoconstriction of microvessels
in the internal capsule. While the vasoconstrictive effects
of ET-1 have been reported to be temporary (3 h) (Hughes
et al., 2003), the ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction produced in
our study was not restored over time. Decreased cerebral
blood flow demand due to the formation of ischemic lesions
at the region of the ET-1 injection may be involved in this
irreversible vasoconstriction of the affected vessels. Since the
reperfusion of a perforating artery does not occur in human
small subcortical infarcts, this irreversibility may be nonproblematic.
Further studies are needed to address this
important issue.
Distinct histological changes have been reported within
ischemic white matter rarefaction in humans as: axonal
damage, the loss of oligodendroglia, demyelination, and the
local activation of astrocytes and microglia (Fernando et al.,
2006). Ischemic insults to the white matter initially cause
axonal damage, which can be detected as axonal swellings or
bulbs. This is followed by instability in the myelin sheath and
subsequent demyelination, which results in the disruption of
neuronal connections, thereby causing a profound disability.
Coincident with the histological changes associated with
human small subcortical infarcts, the loss of axons and
myelin surrounded by reactive gliosis was observed in the
region of the injection in the present study. The tract-tracing
study revealed an interruption in axonal flow in the internal

capsule, suggesting the disconnection of neuronal networks.
Moreover, a decrease in the number of fibers in the corticospinal
tract 8 weeks after the ET-1/L-NAME injection, as
measured byfluorescent staining with SMI-31, resembled the
Wallerian degeneration typically observed after human small
subcortical infarcts (Pierpaoli et al., 2001). Based on the
significant similarities of these histological changes with
white matter strokes in human, we consider our proposed
experimental model in mice to have clinically relevant
aspects of small subcortical infarcts.
According to the systemic review, the animal models of
small vessel disease can be categorized into (1) embolic
injury, (2) hypoperfusion/ischemic injury, (3) hypertensionbased
injury and (4) blood vessel damage (Hainsworth and
Markus, 2008). Our experimental model of small subcortical
infarcts has significant advantages over these previouslyreported
animal models as follows. First of all, the location
and size of the infarct, which are essential for developing
animal models equivalent to human small subcortical
infarcts, was precisely controllable. Compared with the other
subcortical infarct model such as the asymmetric common
carotid artery surgery model (Hattori et al., 2015), creating the
homogenous infarct would be easy in the present model.
Second, long-lasting neurological deficits could be consistently
reproduced, which enabled the extent of the injury and
recovery to be examined. Finally, using mice as experimental
animals has the advantages of the availability of sequence
data, antibodies, and genetically modified strains. We have
used severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with
the advent of research into cell transplantation therapy for
stroke (Ito et al., 2002). This immunodeficient mouse strain is
beneficial because it can support the survival of xenogenic
cell grafts without the need for daily immunosuppression
regimes. On the other hand, the present experimental model
has some limitations. First, our model creates an event of
small subcortical infarcts rather than mimicks the background
pathophysiology, which might be a substantial weakness
of the present model (Pedder et al., 2014). Second, the
injection of ET-1 as well as L-NAME caused several microvessels
to be constricted simultaneously, which was inconsistent
with the ‘‘single vessel’’ theory of small subcortical
infarcts (Bailey et al., 2009). Third, ET-1 may have directly
exhibited effects on the neurons and astrocytes that affect
excitability, gap junctions, and gliosis (Sanchez-Alvarez et al.,
2004), although ET-1 itself is not directly neurotoxic (Nikolov
et al., 1993). Fourth, our model is not suitable for searching
cognitive impairment caused by subcortical infarct, since the
present model does not create multiple ischemic lesions
(Hattori et al., 2015).
In conclusion, we demonstrated that an injection of ET-1
in combination with L-NAME produced focal ischemic lesions
in the internal capsule, resulting in long-lasting neurological
deficits in mice. This reproducibility, simplicity, and easy
adoptability make the present model highly appealing for use
in further pre-clinical studies on small subcortical infarcts.
4. Experimental procedure
4.1. Animals
All animals were treated in accordance with the Code of
Ethics of the World Medical Association as well as Tohoku
University guidelines based on the International Guiding
Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, and
the animal protocols were approved by Tohoku University's
Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Eight- to
ten-week-old male SCID mice (24 g72 g, Charles-River) were
randomly allocated using a coin toss method into two
experimental groups: PBS-injected control group and ET-1/LNAME-injected
group, as described below. No mice were
excluded from the study after the allocation to the experimental
groups. All the assessment of the outcome was
performed by an investigator blinded to the experimental
interventions. Because 4–5 animals were used for each
assessment described below, 76 animals in total were used
in this study.
4.2. Stereotaxic injection of ET1 and L-NAME
A 10-μl syringe with an infusion needle, consisting of polyethylene
tubing (inner diameter, 250μm), a fused silica needle
(inner/outer diameter, 100/170μm), and 24 G needle was
attached to a stereotaxic apparatus (SR-5M, NARISHIGE,
Japan) (Lieberman et al., 1995). Mice were anesthetized with
2.0% isoflurane using a face mask, placed on a stereotaxic
frame, and maintained on 1% to 1.5% isoflurane for the
remainder of the procedure. Rectal temperature was controlled
at 37 1C using a self-regulating heating pad. ET-1
(E7764, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and L-NAME (N5751, Sigma-
Aldrich, USA) were dissolved in sterile saline at 1 mg/ml
and 2.7 mg/ml, respectively. Using a minimally invasive
stereotaxic procedure, the mixture of ET-1 (1.5μl) and L-NAME
(1.5μl) was injected into the right posterior limb of the
internal capsule through the parietal cortex {from the
bregma: anterior–posterior (AP), 2.0 mm; medial–lateral
(ML), þ2.0 mm; dorsal–ventral (DV, from dural surface),
4.0 mm} (Fig. 1B). These coordinates were determined from
the mouse brain atlas). The chemical mixture was delivered
at 0.6μl/min, and the needle was left in situ for 5 min postinjection
before being slowly removed. Mice were maintained
in an air-conditioned room at 20 1C with ad libitum access to
food and water before and after surgery. The animal center
kept the lights on from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.. Physiological
parameters (pH, pCO
2
, pO 
2
, Systolic blood pressure and
Diastolic blood pressure) were measured before and 10 min
after the surgical procedures. The blood was collected from
the femoral artery and analyzed by arterial blood gas analyzer
(i-STAT, fuso pharm, Japan). Systolic and diastolic blood
pressure were measured using tail-cuff (MCP-1, Natsume,
Japan) and manometer (BP-98A L, Softron, Japan).
4.3. Behavioral assessment
A corner test and cylinder test were evaluated by two
individuals blinded to the mouse status 4.5 h, 1 day, and 1,
brain  research  1629  (2015)  318– 328 325
( 8.0.0.2542.791225400 PDF Extractor SDK EVAL VERSION)
2, 4, and 8 weeks after the stroke surgery. Sensorimotor
function was tested using the corner test (Zhang et al.,
2002). The testing apparatus consisted of two connected
cardboard walls (30201cm 3) forming a 301 angle. A small
opening was left at the junction of the walls to motivate the
mice to enter far into the corner. Mice reared on their
hindlimbs and turned to the right or left side after reaching
the corner. Turns were only recorded if mice fully rose on
their hindlimbs. A total of 10 turns were counted. The
asymmetry score was calculated according to the formula:
turns to the left/ total number of turns.
The cylinder test was adapted for use in mice to assess
forelimb use and rotation asymmetry (Li et al., 2004). Mice
were placed in a transparent glass cylinder (9 cm in diameter
and 15 cm in height), and were videotaped during the test.
The cylinder was placed next to a mirror in order to visualize
limb use movements from all angles. Forelimb use of thefirst
contact against the wall after rearing and during lateral
exploration was recorded according to previously described
criteria (Li et al., 2004). A total of 20 vertical movements were
recorded. The asymmetry score was obtained as follows (left
limb useþboth limb use)/(right limb useþboth limb use)
(Balkaya et al., 2013).
4.4. MRI
MRI experiment was performed on a dedicated small animal
scanner with a 5-cm bore operating at 9.4 T field strengths
(AV400WV, Bruker BioSpin). Diffusion weighted image was
performed with following parameters: slice thickness 500μm,
repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)¼2250/18.5 ms, number of
averages¼1.
4.5. Immunofluorescent staining
Mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with PBS
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (163-20145, Wako, Japan)
in PBS, pH 7.4. Brains and spinal cords were postfixed overnight
in the same fixative at 4 1C. Regarding cryosectioning,
fixed tissues were cryoprotected in 15% sucrose (30404-74,
nacalai tesque, Japan) in PBS overnight at 4 1C, then in 25%
sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 1C, and embedded in Tissue-Tek
O.C.T. compound (25608-930, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., USA).
Cryostat sections (7μm) were cut and affixed to glass slides.
Tissue sections were blocked using a blocking solution containing
20% BlockAce (UK-B40, DS pharma, Japan), 5% bovine
serum albumin (A9418, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 0.3% Triton
X-100 (160-24755, Wako, Japan) in 0.02 M PBS, and subsequently
incubated overnight at 4 1C in an appropriate mixture
of primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used:
rat anti-PECAM-1 (1:100; 102501, Bio Legend, USA), rabbit anti-
GFAP (1:500; G3893, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), rabbit anti-GST
(1:500; 312, MBL, Japan), goat anti-Iba1 (1:500; ab5076, Abcam,
USA) and mouse anti-phosphorylated neurofilament H (SMI-
31) (1:1000; SMI-31P-100, Funakoshi, Japan). After three
washes in PBS, tissue sections were incubated for 2 h with a
1:500 dilution of the following secondary antibodies: Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (A21208, Molecular
Probes, USA), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (A21206, Molecular Probes, USA), Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (A11055, Molecular Probes,
USA) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG
(A21202, Molecular Probes, USA). After three washes in PBS,
the samples were covered with SlowFade Gold antifade
reagent (S36937, Life Technology, USA) with 40,6 diamidino-
2-phenylindole (DAPI) (D9542, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The samples
were examined under laser confocal microscopy (C2si;
Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
4.6. Luxol fast blue staining
Tissue sections, prepared as described above, were stained
overnight with 0.1% Luxol fast blue solution {0.1% luxol fast
blue (1B289, CHROMA, Germany) and 0.5% glacial acetic acid
(64-19-7, Wako, Japan) in 95% ethanol} at 37 1C, then washed
in 95% ethanol to remove excess blue staining. The color was
subsequently differentiated (until the white matter was
distinguishable from the gray matter) in a 0.05% lithium
carbonate solution (0.05% lithium carbonate (554-13-2, JUNSEIKAGAKU
, Japan) for 20 s, followed by two washes in 70%
ethanol. The samples were passed through fresh xylene, and
were mounted with entellsan and a cover glass.
4.7. Blood vessel density analysis
Blood vessel density was assessed as described previously
(Sakata et al., 2012) with some modifications. Briefly, vessels
were labeled by a jugular vein injection of DyLight 594-labeled
Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (50μL) (DL-1177, Vector
Laboratories, USA) 10 min before the animals were killed.
The tissue sections obtained at various time points (1 h, 1 day
or 1 week after ET-1/L-NAME or PBS injection) were prepared
as described in the immunofluorescent staining section.
Regarding fluorescent double staining of lectin and PECAM-
1, sections were incubated with rat anti-PECAM-1 (1:100;
102501, Bio Legend, USA), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (A21208, Molecular Probes,
USA). Slides were covered with SlowFade Gold antifade
reagent with DAPI. Images were captured by laser confocal
microscopy at these two coordinates: AP, 2.0 mm; ML,
72.0 mm; DV, 3.5 mm. Blood vessel density was measured
using ImageJ software (version 1.46q; NIH) to determine pixel
number/image, and the average blood vessel density ratio
(ipsilateral/contralateral) was calculated.
4.8. Tract-tracing study
A tract-tracing study was performed as previously described
(Hellenbrand et al., 2013) with some modifications. Briefly,
dextran Alexa Fluor 594 (D-22913, Invitrogen, USA), which has
been used as an anterograde tracer, was stereotactically
injected at these coordinates: (1) AP, 0 mm; ML, þ1.0 mm;
DV, 0.5 mm; (2) AP, þ0.5 mm; ML, þ1.5 mm; DV, 0.5 mm;
(3) AP, þ1.0 mm; ML, þ1.5 mm; DV, 0.5 mm. These targets
approximated the motor cortex (M1 area). After injecting 1μl
of 5% dextran Alexa Fluor 594 at each target, the needle was
left in situ for 1 min to ensure proper diffusion into the
surrounding tissues. Tissue sections of the spinal cord (C1-2
level) were prepared one week after the injection, as
described in the immunofluorescent staining section. Slides
