AGING-INDUCED low-grade inflammation is increasingly
recognized as a causal factor in the development 
of both large - vessel disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, 
peripheral arterial disease) and small - vessel pathologies 
(including vascular cognitive impairment) in older persons  
 ( 1 , 2 ).  The  source  of  age-related  chronic  infl ammation was 
originally attributed to the progressive activation of immune 
cells with age. However, studies during the past decade have 
shown that with advancing age there is a striking increase in 
the secretion of proinflammatory mediators, including various 
cytokines and chemokines, in the vascular wall even in the 
absence of infi  ltrating  immunocytes    ( 2 ).  Previous  studies 
have indicated that in aged endothelial cells production 
of infl ammatory cytokines is signifi  cantly  increased    ( 2 ).  We 
have also provided evidence that aging is associated with 
an increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α
in the vascular smooth muscle cells  (VSMCs)  in rat arteries 
 ( 2 ).  However, a detailed analysis of aging-induced changes in 
a broad range of secreted factors by VSMCs has not yet been 
performed. Moreover, there is no information available of 
age-related alterations in the secretome   of  VSMC s in nonhuman
primates. 
 The mechanisms underlying age-related increases in the 
cellular production of proinflammatory cytokines are likely 
multifaceted. Potential non  –  cell-autonomous causes of vascular
inflammation in aging include activation of toll-like 
receptors by circulating microbial factors, changes in the 
hemodynamic environment (such as higher-than-normal sys-

  There is increasing evidence that age-associated chronic low-grade inflammation promotes the development of both 
large-vessel disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease) and small-vessel pathologies (including 
vascular cognitive impairment) in older persons. However, the source of age-related chronic vascular infl ammation 
remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that cell-autonomous mechanisms contribute to the proinflammatory changes in 
vascular phenotype that accompanies advancing age, we analyzed the cytokine secretion profile of primary vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from young ( ~ 13 years old) and aged ( ~ 21 years old)  Macaca mulatta .  Aged 
VSMCs cultured in the absence of systemic factors exhibited significantly increased secretion    of interleukin-1 β    ,  MCP-1, 
and     tumor  necrosis  factor α  compared with young control cells. Secretion of interleukin-6 also tended to increase in aged 
VSMCs. This age-associated proinflammatory shift in the cellular secretory phenotype was associated with an increased 
mitochondrial O 2
−   production and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activation. Treatment of aged 
VSMCs with a physiologically relevant concentration of resveratrol (1  µ M) exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects, 
reversing aging-induced alterations in the cellular cytokine secretion profile and inhibiting nuclear factor κ-lightchain-enhancer
of activated B cells. Resveratrol also attenuated mitochondrial O 2
−   production and upregulated the 
transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in aged VSMCs. Thus, in non-human primates, cell-autonomous activation of nuclear 
factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and expression of an inflammatory secretome likely contribute to vascular
infl ammation in aging. Resveratrol treatment prevents the proinflammatory properties of the aged VSMC secretome
, an effect that likely contributes to the demonstrated vasoprotective action of resveratrol in animal models of aging.

In addition, recent studies suggest that cell-autonomous 
factors (eg ,  activation of oxidative stress-induced pathways) 
have an important role in chronic activation of vascular infl ammatory processes   ( 3 ).   The effect of aging per se on the 
secretome in vascular cells (independent of age-related changes 
in systemic factors), however, has not been well documented. 
 Pharmacological interventions that attenuate proinfl ammatory
cytokine expression have been shown to confer signifi cant 
vasoprotective effects in various animal models of cardiovascular
diseases in humans. Germane to the present discussion, 
the naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, resveratrol
(3,5,4’-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), has been shown to 
confer vasoprotection and to improve the general health of 
aged laboratory  animals    ( 4  –  10 ).  Resveratrol  was  shown  to  inhibit
cellular pathways involved in infl ammatory  processes 
 ( 11 , 12 ) ,   but  its  effects  on  the  cytokine  expression  profi le of 
aged vascular cells have not been characterized. 
 The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis
that   aging-induced cell-autonomous mechanisms promote
proinflammatory alterations in the secretome of 
 VSMC s of non-human primates. We also sought to determine 
whether treatment of aged VSMCs with a physiologically relevant
concentration of resveratrol exerts anti-infl ammatory 
effects by reversing aging-induced changes in the secretory 
profi le of these cells. We chose to study primary  VSMC s 
derived from young and aged  Macaca    mulatta  because this 
non-human primate model   has the advantage of being phylogenetically
close to humans   while exhibiting few of the complicating
effects of the cardiovascular diseases (eg, diabetes 
and hypertension) associated with aging that may modulate 
the vascular aging phenotype ( 13  –  15 ). By studying the cells 
in culture, the age-related cell-autonomous changes in the 
secretome could be elucidated without the confounding 
effects of systemic factors.

previously described   ( 13 ). VSMCs were grown in Smooth 
Muscle Cell Growth Medium (Cell Applications Inc., San 
Diego, CA)    in  six- well plates (at 37 ° C, 20% O 2).  Upon

senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) described
in various cell types at replicative senescence   ( 41 ). 
We found a significant correlation between the secretory 
profi les of VSMCs derived from aged  M mulatta     and  the 
secretory profiles of mouse ( Figure 3A ) or human ( Figure 
3B )  fi broblasts expressing a n  SASP. The SASP data used 
for these analyses were taken from recent publications   by 
Judith  Campisi,  PhD  ( 41 ).       
 Effect  of   R esveratrol  on   M itochondrial  O 2
−     P roduction  in 
VSMCs  From   A ged   M  mulatta  
 We have shown previously that resveratrol confers mitochondrial
 protective  effects  in  vascular  cells    ( 11 , 18 , 42 , 43 ). 
To determine whether resveratrol attenuates mitochondrial 
oxidative stress in aged VSMCs ,  we have utilized a Mito-
Sox fluorescence-based approach. We found that in VSMCs 
derived from aged  M mulatta ,    MitoSox    fl uorescence 
( Figure 4A ), indicating mitochondrial O 2
−    generation, was 
signifi cantly increased compared  with  that in cells from 
young animals. Treatment with resveratrol significantly decreased
MitoSox fl  uorescence  in  aged  VSMCs  ( Figure  4A ).       
 Effect  of   R esveratrol  on   T ranscriptional   A ctivity  of  NF- κ B 
in  VSMCs  From   A ged   M  mulatta  
 Previously, we have found that age-related vascular 
infl ammation in laboratory rodents is associated with increased
NF- κ B  activation    ( 3 , 44 ).  We  found  that  in  VSMCs 
   derived  from  aged   M mulatta , transcriptional activity of 
NF- κ B  was ,   in  the  present  study    also ,   signifi cantly increased 
compared   with   VSMC s   from  young  monkeys  ( Figure  4B ). 
Resveratrol treatment significantly inhibited NF- κ B  activation
in VSMCs from aged  M mulatta    ( Figure  4B ).   
 Resveratrol- I nduced  Nrf2   A ctivation  in  VSMCs  From   A ged 
 M  mulatta  
 Recent studies suggest    that the antioxidant responsive element
/Nrf2 pathway is an important molecular target of resveratrol
in multiple cell types    ( 19 , 45  –  47 ).  To  determine 
whether resveratrol can activate Nrf2 in aged VSMCs of 
non-human primates ,  we performed a reporter gene assay. 
We found that resveratrol, even at submicromolar concentrations
, significantly increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in 
VSMCs of aged  M mulatta   ( Figure  4C ).    
 Discussion 
 The principal new finding of this study is that aging in 
non-human primates significantly alters the secretome of 
 VSMC s. Characterization of this secretome highlights an increased
production of proinflammatory cytokines, including 
several factors (ie ,  IL-6, IL-1 β ,  TNF α ) previously identifi ed in

mouse ( A ) or human ( B )  fi broblasts expressing a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The VSMC data are from the data   sets presented in  Figures 1  and  2  and 
are expressed as fold changes, using the corresponding secretory profiles of VSMCs derived from young  M mulatta     as  baseline.  The  fi broblast data are taken from 
recent publications ( 41 ). The fibroblasts were rendered senescent by x-ray irradiation (XRA). Baselines for the senescent profiles of fibroblasts are the corresponding 
profiles of dividing presenescent fibroblasts (PRE ;  data are expressed as log 2  [fold  changes])  ( 41 ).

rodents    ( 2 , 48  –  50 ).  These  observations  support  the concept
that the age-associated changes in the secretome of 
vascular cells (previously described as age-associated arterial
secretory phenotype   [ 51 ]) are, at least in part, due to 
cell-autonomous mechanisms. Similar conclusions have

of inflammatory cytokines, when chronically present, 
can disrupt tissue structure and promote the development of

from an artery providing blood supply to the brain in the

noted that age-related changes in the cellular secretome are 
likely very complex ( eg , the Secreted Protein Discovery Initiative
identifi ed  > 1 , 000 different proteins secreted by cells 
 [ 55 ]) and aging likely affects a large number of secreted proteins
in addition to the cytokines assessed. Because VSMCs 
play a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular 
diseases, the primate VSMC secretome may be a valuable 
source of potential biomarkers for age-related cardiovascular
diseases in humans. To promote vascular disease ,  aged 
VSMCs likely interact with endothelial cells. Thus, in future 
studies ,  it would be interesting to assess the endothelial 
effects of the conditioned media obtained from young and 
aged VSMCs. 
 To delineate the mechanisms that may contribute to the 
age-related changes in the cellular secretome, we measured 
the transcriptional activity of NF- κ B in VSMCs derived 
from young and aged  M mulatta .    Our  present  fi ndings and 
data from previous studies   ( 13 ) show that aged VSMCs  
 exhibit increased transcriptional activity of NF- κ B,  as 
compared  with  that in cells derived from young animals. 
Consistent with these ex vivo data, previously ,  we reported 
that blood vessels isolated from aged  M mulatta    also  exhibit 
increased nuclear translocation of NF- κ B    ( 13 ).  Increased 
NF- κ B activation appears to be a hallmark of vascular aging 
as it has been repeatedly demonstrated both in aged laboratory
rodents    ( 3 , 56 )  and  elderly  humans    ( 57 ).  Although  there 
is strong evidence that increased NF- κ B activation promotes
proinflammatory changes in the cellular cytokine 
expression profi le in the vasculature   ( 58 ), further studies are 
warranted to establish the causal link between age-related 
induction of NF- κ B and changes in the secretome   of VSMCs. 
The cell-autonomous mechanisms responsible for increased 
NF- κ B activation in the aged vascular cells likely include 
an increased release of H 2O 2  from  the  mitochondria  ( 3 , 13 ). 
This conclusion is supported by the findings that mitochondrial
   antioxidant responsive element generation is signifi -
cantly increased in VSMCs of aged  M mulatta     even  in  the 
absence of circulating factors and that increased NF- κ B 
activation in VSMCs of aged  M mulatta  can be attenuated 
by scavenging of H 2O 2   ( 13 ).  In  addition  to  cell-autonomous 
pathways, changes in circulating factors (ie ,  age-related increases
in the plasma levels of angiotensin II and TNF α
 [ 44 , 49 ])    may  also  contribute  to  increased  NF- κ B  activation 
in the aged vasculature   in vivo, which may exacerbate vascular
inflammation in aging. 
 Interestingly, cultured cells,   that are growth - arrested by 
multiple passaging or x-ray irradiation,   also exhibit distinctive
changes in the profile of secreted cytokines, a phenotype
 that  has  been  termed  the  SASP    ( 41 , 54 , 59 , 60 ).  Previous 
studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SASP shares many 
features with  age-associated arterial secretory phenotype   
 ( 51 ). Recent studies suggest that the expression of SASP 
(and likely  age-associated arterial secretory phenotype   
 [ 52 ])   is   evolutionarily  conserved    ( 41 )  and  that  these  changes

 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF RESVERATROL IN PRIMATE AGING 7
have a role in the development of age-related pathophysiological
alterations in many organs   ( 54 , 61 ). Interestingly, the 
SASPs described in senescent mouse and human fi  broblasts  
 ( 41 )    and  the   age-associated  arterial  secretory  phenotype  
described in rats   ( 52 )   overlap substantially with secretory 
profi les of VSMCs derived from aged  M mulatta  that (in 
contrast to prior studies of SASP) were not growth - arrested 
( Figure 3 ).   Cellular replicative senescence is characterized 
by an increased activation of NF- κ B, which has been causally
linked to the expression of SASP both in human fi broblasts
and in porcine coronary arterial endothelial cells after 
multiple  passaging    ( 62 , 63 ).  Whether  replicative  senescence 
   has a causative role in organismal aging is controversial, yet, 
the aforementioned observations raise the possibility that 
common cellular pathways, including NF- κ B  activation, 
may underlie the proinfl ammatory  phenotypic  changes 
observed in the cells derived from aged organisms (including 
expression of  age-associated arterial secretory phenotype   
 ( 51 ) and the expression of SASP in senescent cells   in vitro ) .  
 Interestingly,  VSMCs  derived     from   both   aged   M mulatta
and non-dividing senescent cells secrete increased amounts 
of  VEGF    ( 41 , 64 , 65 ),  suggesting  that,    in  addition  to  NF- κ B 
activation, multiple pathways are activated both in cells of 
aged animals and  in  cells at replicative senescence. 
 Here ,  we show for the first time that in VSMCs   derived 
from aged non-human primates resveratrol treatment confers
significant anti-inflammatory effects, reversing the ageinduced
alterations in the cellular secretome. The available 
evidence suggests that in vivo treatment with resveratrol 
also exerts similar anti-inflammatory effects on the cytokine 
expression profile in the vascular wall of aged animals. For 
example, treatment of aged mice with resveratrol downregulates
vascular expression of a range of proinfl ammatory 
cytokines    ( 6 )  and  attenuate s      LPS-induced  secretion  of 
IL-1 β  and other paracrine mediators   ( 66 ). Resveratrol treatment
also inhibits expression of proinflammatory cytokines 
in vessels of animals with pathological conditions associated 
with oxidative stress   ( 38 ) and accelerated vascular aging  
 ( 67 ). Interestingly, resveratrol also reversed the age-related 
increases of the secretion of noninflammatory factors, including VEGF. Finally, resveratrol also inhibits the secretion of 
cytokines,  which  does not markedly increase with age, 
including that of interferon-gamma   and IL-10. Future 
studies should determine whether targeting subclinical 
changes in the vascular secretome may reduce the incidence 
and progression of age-associated arterial diseases, including
hypertension and atherosclerosis. 
 The inhibitory effects of resveratrol on cellular expression 
of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines ,  and other paracrine
mediators are likely not cell type specific. For example, 
treatment with resveratrol has been reported to inhibit 
expression of IL-6, IL-17 ,  and MCP-1 in endothelial cells  
 ( 12 , 68 ),  cardiac  fibroblasts    ( 69 ) ,   and  adipocytes    ( 70 ),  respectively.
In addition to altering vascular secretion of chemokines
, resveratrol treatment may also inhibit monocyte 
chemotaxis to the vascular wall by interfering with Rho 
kinase-dependent signaling pathways in the leukocytes 
themselves   ( 71 ). Resveratrol was also shown to inhibit expression
of IL-8, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor ,  and/or VEGF in human airway smooth muscle cells 
( 72 ) and human retinal cells   ( 73 ). Treatment of aged mice 
with resveratrol also inhibits proinfl ammatory cytokine expression
in immune cells   ( 74 ). Recent studies demonstrate 
that treatment of human subjects with resveratrol and/or 
resveratrol-containing extract of  Polygonum    cuspidatum
 decreases plasma concentrations of TNF α ,  IL-1 β  ,   and  IL-6 
( 75 , 76 ). Recent studies also suggest that resveratrol treatment
in vivo exerts vasoprotective effects in a non-human 
primate model of accelerated vascular aging (metabolic arterial
inflammation; Z. Ungvari, MD, PhD, A. Csiszar, 
MD, PhD, R. de Cabo, PhD, and E. G. Lakatta, MD, 
PhD,  manuscript in preparation,  2011   ). Further studies are 
warranted to determine whether treatment with resveratrol 
also attenuates aging-induced vascular inflammation in humans
and/or non-human primates. 
 The molecular mechanisms underlying the antiinfl ammatory effects of resveratrol are likely multifaceted. 
We propose that the ability of resveratrol to attenuate mitochondrial
oxidative stress and to inhibit NF- κ B  activity 
contribute s   signifi cantly to its ability to attenuate secretion 
of proinflammatory cytokines by VSMCs from aged nonhuman
primates. This view is supported by results of previous 
studies   demonstrating that resveratrol treatment effectively 
decreases oxidative stress and inhibits NF- κ B  –  driven  gene 
expression  in  arteries  of  aged  rodents    ( 3 , 6 ).  Further,    resveratrolinduced
attenuation of mitochondrial antioxidant responsive
element production   ( 18 ) and inhibition of NF- κ B  ( 12 ) 
are also associated with downregulation of inflammatory cytokines
in vascular endothelial cells as well. The mechanisms
by which resveratrol inhibits NF- κ B likely include 
activation  of  SIRT1    ( 11 , 77 ).  In  addition, recent studies suggest
that resveratrol is a potent activator of Nrf2    ( 19 )  and 
that a cross   talk exists between Nrf2 and NF- κ B  signaling. 
Recent studies suggest that aging results in dysregulation 
of Nrf2 signaling in the vasculature, impairing the ability 
of aged cells to mount an effective antioxidant defense in 
response to an increased production of antioxidant responsive
 element    ( 13 , 78 , 79 ).  Because  we  found  that  the  ability 
of resveratrol to activate Nrf2 in VSMCs is preserved in 
aging  ( Figure 4C ), we propose that activation of Nrf2 by 
resveratrol contributes to the inhibition of NF- κ B in vascular
cells of non-human primates. Importantly, resveratrol was 
recently shown to inhibit neointimal formation by a n  Nrf2-dependent pathway in mice ( 80 ). The aforementioned pathways
may also contribute to the effects of resveratrol on 
replicative    senescence  –  associated  cellular  alterations    ( 62 , 81 ). 
The posttranscriptional regulation of cytokine genes via the 
destabilizing activity    of microRNAs likely plays a role in 
regulation of the half-life of many cytokines and achieving
the temporal and spatial distributions required for

regulation of these genes. Resveratrol has been shown to 
affect microRNAs in  the  cardiovascular  system    ( 82 , 83 ). 
Thus, it is possible that regulation of microRNAs by resveratrol
may also contribute to the downregulation of infl ammatory cytokines in aged VSMCs. 
 Taken together, resveratrol in physiologically relevant 
concentrations reverses the proinflammatory properties of 
the VSMC   secretome of aged non-human primates. When 
viewed within the broader context of prior studies, the fi ndings 
presented herein provide additional support for the concept 
that resveratrol confers beneficial effects in the aged cardiovascular
system (and possibly other organs, including the 
skeletal  muscle    ( 7 , 8 )  and  the  brain    [ 84 ])  by  attenuating 
age-associated chronic low-grade infl ammation. These effects 
are likely independent of the effects of resveratrol on life  
 span    ( 40 ).  Future  studies  will     be  necessary  to  elucidate 
the role of resveratrol-sensitive pathways (including Nrf2 
activation) on the regulation of the secretome in the aged 
vasculature, to open new avenues for therapeutic intervention
for the prevention/treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
in  the  elderly   population .

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF RESVERATROL IN PRIMATE AGING 819 CSISZAR ET AL. 8
regulation of these genes. Resveratrol has been shown to 
affect microRNAs in  the  cardiovascular  system    ( 82 , 83 ). 
Thus, it is possible that regulation of microRNAs by resveratrol
may also contribute to the downregulation of infl ammatory cytokines in aged VSMCs. 
 Taken together, resveratrol in physiologically relevant 
concentrations reverses the proinflammatory properties of 
the VSMC   secretome of aged non-human primates. When 
viewed within the broader context of prior studies, the fi ndings 
presented herein provide additional support for the concept 
that resveratrol confers beneficial effects in the aged cardiovascular
system (and possibly other organs, including the 
skeletal  muscle    ( 7 , 8 )  and  the  brain    [ 84 ])  by  attenuating 
age-associated chronic low-grade infl ammation. These effects 
are likely independent of the effects of resveratrol on life  
 span    ( 40 ).  Future  studies  will     be  necessary  to  elucidate 
the role of resveratrol-sensitive pathways (including Nrf2 
activation) on the regulation of the secretome in the aged 
vasculature, to open new avenues for therapeutic intervention
for the prevention/treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
in  the  elderly   population .
