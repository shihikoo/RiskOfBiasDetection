The homocysteine theory of arteriosclerosis received credence when it was shown that after a methionine load, circulating
homocysteine–cysteine concentrations were higher in cardiovascular disease patients than in healthy controls.
Subsequent studies showing associations between homocysteine and coronary artery disease, stroke and cognitive
impairment, relied on small increases in homocysteine concentration unlike the very high homocysteine seen in the
rare genetic disorders that lead to homocystinuria and much higher homocysteine levels. Subsequent studies in cell
culture, animals, and humans showed that a variety of cardiovascular adverse effects of “high homocysteine” introduced
either as a nonphysiological bolus or as a methionine load led to high homocysteine. We fed apolipoprotein
E–deficient mice diets designed to achieve three conditions: (1) high methionine intake with normal blood homocysteine
, (2) high methionine intake with B vitamin deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia, and (3) normal methionine
intake with both B vitamin deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia. We found that the mice fed methionine-rich diets
had significant atheromatous pathology in the aortic arch even with normal plasma homocysteine levels. Mice fed
B vitamin–deficient diets developed severe hyperhomocysteinemia but without any increase in vascular pathology.
Our findings suggest that even moderate increases in methionine intake are atherogenic in susceptible mice while
high plasma homocysteine is not.

Introduction
Methionine is a sulfur amino acid with essential
roles in intermediary metabolism. In addition to
functioning as a protein building block, methionine
can serve as a precursor for cysteine and glutathione,
and is the precursor of both S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM), the universal methyl donor for over
100 reactions, and of certain polyamines (Fig. 1).
These last two functions render methionine an
essential amino acid, even though the mammals are
capable of its synthesis. In this synthesis, homocysteine
, a product of the SAM-dependent methylation
reactions, is methylated to form methionine, a reaction
catalyzed by two different enzymes: betainehomocysteine
methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.5) that
locates in the liver and to some extent in the
kidney; and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.13), which is
vitamin B12 depedent, is found in all tissues, and is
embryonic lethal if its gene is knocked out.1
The relationship between methionine and
arteriosclerosis was first pointed out by McCully2
in 1969 who noted the high prevalence of early
arteriosclerotic and thromboembolic disease in
patients with congenital homocysinuria. Initially,
this proposal received little attention. Homocysteine
concentrations in these patients with rare
congenital defects leading to homocystinuria were
uncommonly high and were not deemed a public
health risk. However, in 1976, Wilken and Wilken3
published a study showing that after a methionine
load concentrations of homocysteine–cysteine

mixed disulfide were significantly higher in 10%
of the patients (n = 22) compared to age-matched
healthy controls. What was particularly important
about this observation was that concentrations of
the homocysteine–cysteine mixed disulfide in cardiovascular
disease (CVD) patients were far lower
(17 M) than those (>200 M) in patients with
vitamin B12–related or cystathionine synthase–
relatedcongenitaldisorders.Thefactthatthehomocysteine
in CVD patients is only slightly higher than
normal nevertheless became the basis for numerous
studies in cell cultures, animals, and humans. Most
assumed that the slightly higher homocysteine
found in patients with CVD and other diseases was
at least a partial cause of the disease and that this
could be modified by vitamin intake to lower the
exposure to homocysteine. For example, studies in
which cultured cells were incubated with homocysteine
showed a variety of deleterious effects,
including inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis, activation
of factor V, inhibition of protein C activation,
downregulation of thrombomodulin expression,
and blocking the binding of tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA)—but not of plasminogen—to
endothelial cells.4,5 Other toxic effects attributed to
homocysteine include increased platelet adhesion,
impaired regulation of endothelium-derived relaxing
factor and related nitrogen oxides, induction
of tissue factor, suppression of heparin sulfate
expression, stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation
, and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein.
A major limitation of all the above-mentioned
observations is that the pathophysiological significance
of the experimental exposure of cells to high
homocysteine concentrations is indeterminate.
Human plasma contains two sulfur-containing
amino acids, homocysteine and cysteine, at respective
mean normal concentrations of 10 and 240
mol/L. In mild hyperhomocysteinemia, the levels
of homocysteine are on average 30% higher than
normal, in contrast to rare, severe cases of homocystinuria
, where the levels may be as high as 200–
400 mol/L.6,7 As cysteine appears to be harmless
and to bear no relationship to disease, it was inferred
that the putative action of homocysteine on the
blood vessel wall and the coagulation system is stereospecific
, and that it involves the entire molecule
and takes place at low concentrations (in the micromolar
range). However, these crucial considerations
were rarely addressed in studies on mechanism.

Methionine intake and atherogenicity Selhub & Troen
The homocysteine concentrations that were typically
used (1–10 mmol/L) often exceeded the
levels encountered even under the most severe
pathological conditions. Thus, the possibility
that the observed effects were due to nonspecific
reactivity of the sulfhydryl group of the homocysteine
molecule could not be ruled out. Indeed,
in several studies where other thiol-containing
compounds such as cysteine and mercaptoethanol
were tested, the effects were similar to these seen
with homocysteine (for example, see Ref. 8 and also
Refs. 9–12). Thus, it is difficult to know whether
such mechanisms might also mediate the increase in
relative risk found in human observational studies,
where there is a far milder but chronic exposure
of the arterial wall to micromolar increments of
circulating homocysteine.
In an attempt to examine whether such mechanisms
occur in vivo, homocysteine levels can be
experimentally raised by dietary interventions in
both animal models and in humans by depleting
folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6; by direct intake
of homocysteine; and by an oral methionine load.
The methionine load was first introduced to identify
subjects who are heterozygotes for cystathionine
-synthase deficiency13,14 and later routinely used
to identify hyperhomocysteinemic patients that for
some reason or another have higher postload homocysteine
levels.15 Importantly, the methionine load
has consistently been found to impair vascular function.
For example, Bellamy et al.15 showed that
a postmethionine load increase in homocysteine
from 7.9 to 23 M was associated with a substantial
decrease in flow-mediated brachial artery
dilatation (from 0.212 to 0.06 mm). A second study
of 20 healthy individuals by Nappo et al.16 has
shown that a methionine load was associated with
increased homocysteine from 10 to about 23 M
and increased coagulation and circulating adhesion
molecule levels (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, tPA,
F1+2, fibrinopeptide, PAI-1, and D-dimer) and
impaired vascular response to arginine load. What is
interesting in this study is that administration of
vitamins E and C with the methionine prevented
all the vascular outcomes except for homocysteine,
which remained high. This finding raises the possibility
that either the vitamins prevent the toxic
effects of homocysteine by interfering with its reaction
on molecular targets or that homocysteine
is not the effector of toxicity. Some studies have
shown that oral methionine loading is associated
withlowerflow-mediateddilatation(FMD),17while
others have suggested that methionine loading is
associated with a lower FMD in type 2 diabetes.18 In
rats, excess methionine intake was associated with
decreased elasticity of aortic lamina and increased
thickness of the aortic wall.19 Morita et al.20 have
shown that feeding high methionine (1.2–2.0%)
or homocysteine to rats exacerbates neointima formation
after a denuding injury, thereby setting the
stage for more rapid restenosis. Folate could ordinarily
ameliorate the detrimental effects, but not
when rats were fed 2% methionine. Other studies in
rats, rabbits, and mini pigs show similar results.21–23
In the most recent study in healthy humans, an
oral methionine load induced a significant increase
in total plasma homocysteine concentrations and
decreased aortic distensibility within 3 hours. These
were also associated with a significant increase in Tei
index, a measure of myocardial function (P<0.001)
that suggests a worsening compared with baseline
values.24
Taken together, these and other studies show that
oral methionine loading is undoubtedly associated
with adverse outcomes that are closely related to
endothelial cell dysfunction and to increased risk
of CVD. The question remains, however, whether
these effects are the reflection of the increased
homocysteine concentration caused by the high
level of methionine load, by methionine per se,
or by other aspects of its metabolism. According
to Ubbink et al.,25 4 h after a methionine load
of 100 mg/kg body weight, plasma methionine
level reaches about 400mol/L compared to about
25–30 mol/L homocysteine. Many of the studies
that employed the methionine loading test in
humans or prolonged feeding of high homocysteine
in animal models have not controlled for the
possibility that it is the high methionine rather
than the high homocysteine that produced these
effects. Moreover, the theory that circulating homocysteine
is directly atherogenic cannot account for
thefactthatalthoughdeletingthecystathioninebeta
synthase (CBS) and the methylene tetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR) genes in mice both cause severe
hyperhomocysteinemia, neither produce the vascular
pathology seen in human with congenital defects
in these genes.26,27 In addition to their effects on circulating
homocysteine, both these mutations cause
an imbalance of methionine metabolism.

The idea that excess methionine intake is toxic
is not new.28 A typical study published in 1970
showed that feeding guinea pigs a diet with 10 mM/
kg l-methionine per day rapidly leads to a state
characterized by fatty liver, hypoglycemia, and
aminoacidemia and later by hypothermia, profound
hypoglycemia, and death within 60 hours.29 There
was also a substantial decrease in hepatic adenosine
triphosphate most likely due to interaction with
methionine to form SAM.
Homocysteine is a nonprotein-forming amino
acid, which functions as both a product and a
substrate of methionine (Fig. 1). Hyperhomocysteinemia
can therefore occur either as a result of
excessive intake of methionine as in the methionine
loading studies where the homocysteine methylation
machinery is insufficient to remethylate the
large amount of homocysteine produced or in the
absence of vitamins, or in those with congenital
defect in genes that code for enzymes in the one
carbon metabolic pathway.
We took advantage of the biochemical pathways
of homocysteine metabolism to assess whether the
two types of hyperhomocteinemia, one caused by
B vitamin deficiency and one by excess methionine
differwithrespecttotheireffectsonatherogenesis.30
For this purpose, we chose the apolipoprotein
E (ApoE)–deficient mice.31–33 Thesemicedevelop
hypercholesterolemia and spontaneous atherosclerotic
lesions in the aortic root and branch points in a
pattern resembling human atheromas26that include
the accumulation of oxidized lipids34–37and inflammatory
markers.38 Moreover, they develop spontaneous
vascular lesionsin vivo, and can therefore be
used to assess various diets as potential modifiers of
the rate and extent of lesion progression.36,39–44
We allocated young male ApoE-deficient mice to
receive one of four diets: (1) a control diet formulatedwith3.3gmethionine
/kgdiet,(2)highmethionine
(7.7 g methionine/kg diet) in combination with
B vitamin deficiency (less than 10% of control levels
of required B vitamins folate, B12 and B6) (M+B−),
(3) B vitamin deficiency with normal methionine
(B−), and (4) high methionine combined with high
B vitamins at 3× control levels (M+B+).
After 10 weeks, consumption of the B vitamin–
deficient diets (M+B− and B−) was associated with
high degree of hyperhomocysteinemia (Fig. 2) and
lowest levels of the three vitamins.30The most severe
hyperhomocysteinemia resulted from the normal
methionine, B vitamin–deficient (B−) diet (plasma
total homocysteine (243.7 ± 82.0 M). Combining
high methionine and B vitamin deficiency in
the M+B− diet attenuated the rise in plasma homocysteine
that was achieved by B vitamin deficiency
alone. Nevertheless, homocysteine remained significantly
elevated with plasma total homocysteine
(86 ± 25M),inmarkedcontrasttocontrolswith
plasma total homocysteine (5.1 ± 1.0 and 4.6 ±
1.4M, respectively). The basis for this attenuation
is likely due to the allosteric activation of CBS by
SAM. Normally, methionine can be conserved during
B vitamin deficiency by the drop in SAM that
limits CBS, otherwise that would divert methionine
from the methylation cycle to the transsulfuration
pathway. However, even during B vitamin
deficiency, ingested methionine can be converted
to SAM, thereby stimulating the clearance of excess
homocysteine via transsulfuration.45
Dietary methionine enrichment did not affect
plasma methionine concentrations irrespective
of B vitamin status (Table 1). Nevertheless,
methionine-enriched diets significantly increased
aortic lesion area, as shown in Figure 3, which

the B− group had the highest plasma homocysteine levels. In contrast, the lesion area was significantly higher in mice fed the
high-methionine, vitamin-supplemented “M−B−” diet than in controls, despite the fact that homocysteine levels in this group were
normal (Table 1). tHcy, plasma total homocysteine. Bars indicated by different letters (a, b, and c) are significantly different within

B vitamin–deficient diet (B−) and the methioninerich
and B vitamin–deficient diet (M+B−).
The most interesting finding in this study was the
dissociation of the effects of methionine intake from
hyperhomocysteinemia with respect to their relation
to the vascular lesions (Fig. 2). The methioninerich
, B vitamin–deficient diet (M+B−)resultedin
a nearly twofold increase in lesion area compared
with controls where lesion area was 45,923 ±
2804 versus 24 ± 1712 m2, respectively ( P <
0.05). B vitamin enrichment (M+B+) only partially
mitigated this increase despite completely normalizing
homocysteine levels: lesion area was 37,936 ±
1298m2,P<0.05 versus controls. It is particularly
noteworthy that mice with the most severely elevated
homocysteine and normal dietary methionine
(B− diet) showed no increase in lesion area compared
with controls: lesion area was 23,986 ±
1877 m2. Figure 3 illustrates the histological
demonstration of aortic atheromatous plaques in
mice fed the M+B+ and B− diets.
A quantitative analysis of the aortic plaque area
10 weeks after initiation of the diets (Fig. 2) showed
that both groups receiving methionine-enriched
diets have significantly increased area compared
to those from a control diet (C) or a diet with
B vitamin deficiency (B−) and normal methionine.
Curiously, the aortic plaque area was slightly but significantly
higher in mice receiving the high methionine
vitamin B–deficient diet (M+B−) than those on
a diet with excess methionine and excess B vitamin
(M+B+) (Fig. 2). This difference could mean that
under these conditions, some of the lesions could
be prevented by higher than normal vitamin intake.
This interaction between B vitamin and methionine
illustrates the critical importance of metabolic
context for attributing toxicity to a given metabolite
such as methionine or homocysteine. In this
study, the harm caused by the identical intake of
dietary methionine depended on the availability of
B vitamins, presumably by altering fluxes through
their interconnected pathways or by compensating

for methionine-induced vitamin depletion. Indeed,
the dependence of methionine toxicity on the availability
of other nutrients is well documented. For
example,addinghighdietarymethioninetoafolatedeficient
diet can mitigate the cognitive impairment
caused by folate deficiency alone, without
affecting homocysteine.46 Similarly, toxic effects of
excess dietary methionine have long been known to
depend on the balance of other amino acids.47
Although it is difficult to directly translate
these findings from animal studies to humans,
the principle of metabolic context determining
outcomes related to a given level of any single
nutrient is broadly applicable. While methionine
in the normal range of human intake is not acutely
toxic,48 clinical studies in humans clearly show
that the effects of methionine loading depend
on underlying metabolic conditions.49 As a discussion
of clinical trials of B vitamin therapy for
homocysteine-lowering and secondary prevention
of CVD is beyond the scope of this review, it is
noteworthy in this regard that the failure of many
randomized clinical trials to prevent secondary
CVD by “homocysteine-lowering” through B
vitamin supplementation may be due, in part, to
a failure to adequately consider the underlying
metabolic heterogeneity of hyperhomocysteinemia
(i.e., with respect to background B vitamin, protein,
and methionine intake, as well as other factors) in
designing the studies, thereby attenuating the signal
for any benefit in responsive subgroups.50–52 Future
research on the long-term influence of high methionine
intake on cardiovascular health and other
outcomes will need sophisticated approaches to go
beyond homocysteine and evaluate overall protein
intake, protein quality, and dietary patterns.53 Such
efforts will undoubtedly be advanced by employing
new metabolomic techniques in evaluating the relationship
between methionine intake, metabolism,
and disease.54,55
In conclusion, the atherogenic potential of
excess dietary methionine that we and others have
described in the ApoE-deficient mouse model30,56,57
underscores the central role that methionine and
its metabolic products can play in CVD, without
any apparent mediation by circulating homocysteine.
Although micromolar elevations of circulating
homocysteine are frequently described as an
“independent” risk factor for CVD in human observational
studies, this “independence” is strictly in
the epidemiological–mathematical sense of statistical
independence from any of the other observed
covariates included in a multivariable statistical
model, but they do not rule out other plausible
explanations for the association. Biologically, fluctuations
in circulating homocysteine always follow
from changes in flux through the intersecting
metabolic pathways that inseparably link methionine
to homocysteine. Excessive methionine intake
canundoubtedlyperturbthismetabolismwithdeleterious
vascular consequences. However, whether
any specific products of these pathways inflict the
vascular damage remains to be determined. Recognition
of the potent atherogenic potential of excess
methionine intake provides an important point of
departure for such investigations. Understanding
the metabolic events linking methionine excess to
pathology, and their dependence on other underlying
metabolic and pathologic conditions, will
provide crucial insight into the role these important
diet-dependent pathways play in cardiovascular
health and disease.
