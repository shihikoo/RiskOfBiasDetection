Abstract Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI) is harmful to
the cerebral system and causes mitochondrial oxidative stress.
The antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated antioxidant
pathway plays an important role in maintaining the redox
status of the brain. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), combined with
potent AREs in the promoter of HO-1, is a highly effective
therapeutic target for protection against cerebral IRI.
Pterostilbene (PTE), a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol
from blueberries, is a strong natural antioxidant. PTE has
been shown to be beneficial for some nervous system diseases
and may regulate HO-1 signaling. This study was designed to
investigate the protective effects of PTE on cerebral IRI and to
elucidate potential mechanisms underlying those effects.
Mouse brains and cultured HT22 neuron cells were subjected
to IRI. Prior to this procedure, the brains or cells were exposed
to PTE in the absence or presence of the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP
or HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). PTE conferred a
cerebral protective effect, as shown by increased neurological
scores, viable neurons and decreased brain edema as well as a
decreased ion content and apoptotic ratio in vivo. PTE also
increased the cell viability and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) leakage and apoptotic ratio in vitro. ZnPP and
HO-1 siRNA both blocked PTE-mediated cerebral protection
by inhibiting HO-1 signaling and further inhibited two HO-1
signaling-related antioxidant molecules: NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferases
(GSTs), which are induced by PTE. PTE also promoted a
well-preserved mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP),
mitochondria complex I activity, and mitochondria complex
IV activity, increased the mitochondrial cytochrome c level,
and decreased the cytosolic cytochrome c level. However, this
PTE-elevated mitochondrial function was reversed by ZnPP
or HO-1 siRNA treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate
that PTE treatment attenuates cerebral IRI by reducing
IR-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage through the activation
of HO-1 signaling.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the most serious human disorders
leading to long-term disability and high mortality [1].
Thrombolytic agents have been used in ischemic stroke, but
their application is limited due to a narrow time window [2].
Oxidative stress and mitochondrial enzyme dysfunction are
the consequences of cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury

(IRI), and this damage, in turn, aggravates IRI. The triggering
of mitochondrial oxidative damage causes a series of changes
in mitochondrial structure and function, such as mitochondrial
permeability, mitochondrial swelling, the release of proapoptotic
proteins, and the uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation [3]. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction
destroys ionic homeostasis and neurological function
and ultimately causes cerebral apoptosis and necrosis.
Therefore, protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage
could be a rational method for ameliorating cerebral IRI [4].
When applied before ischemia occurs, ischemic preconditioning
(IPC), which consists of brief periods of ischemia alternated
with brief periods of reflow, effectively reduces the cerebral
infarct size in all of the species that have been tested, including
humans [5, 6]. However, the classic IPC procedure may generate
additional injuries in the target tissue. Therefore, alternative
methods that mimic the protective effects of classic conditioning
have been explored, including remote preconditioning
and protective drug delivery prior to ischemia [7, 8].
Pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxystilbene, 4′-[(1E)-
2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethenyl]phenol (PTE)), a natural
dimethylated analog of resveratrol from blueberries, is known
to have diverse pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammation
, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptotic, and analgesic
properties [9, 10]. The dietary administration of high doses
of PTE is not toxic in mice [11]. Under most circumstances,
PTE is either equally or significantly more potent than resveratrol.
PTE may have greater biological activity due to better
bioavailability resulting from the substitution of a hydroxyl
group with a methoxyl group, which increases the molecule’s
lipophilicity [12]. PTE has been shown to be beneficial for
some nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative
diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease) [13–16], learning and
memory impairments [17], anxiety disorders [18], and agerelated
cognitive disorders [19]. Studies have also shown that
resveratrol can attenuate cerebral IRI via multiple mechanisms
[6, 20]. However, the effects of PTE on cerebral IRI and the
mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been
elucidated.
Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate-limiting enzyme required
for the conversion of heme into bilirubin, biliverdin, and carbon
monoxide [21]. Heme exists in two isoforms: HO-1,
which is highly inducible, and HO-2, which is constitutively
present in the brain [22]. HO-1 is a stress response protein,
which is highly inducible in response to pathological stimulation.
Due to the cumulative effects of HO-1 on heme catabolism
and to the generation of biologically active downstream
products, the induction of HO-1 might serve as a protective
mechanism against oxidative injury [23]. The HO-1 signaling
pathway has been shown to be protective in many pathological
conditions associated with the classical antioxidant molecules
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione
S-transferases (GSTs), including cerebral diseases
[24–26]. IPC and resveratrol treatment reduced cerebral IRI
via HO-1 signaling activation [5, 27]. Moreover, the pharmacological effects of PTE can be achieved through the regulation
of HO-1 signaling [28,29]. Additionally, the activation of
HO-1 reduces oxidative stress and maintains mitochondrial
function [30–33].
Above all, this study was designed to evaluate the protective
effect of PTE pretreatment on cerebral IRI and to investigate
the potential effects of PTE on the cerebral mitochondrial
redox state and mitochondrial function. The involvement of
HO-1 signaling in mediating the protective mechanisms of
PTE was also evaluated.
Materials and Methods
This study was performed according to the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, which was published by the
US National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.
All experiments were performed on healthy adult male
C57BL/6 J mice that weighed between 20 and 22 g, which
were obtained from the animal center of the Fourth Military
Medical University. The rats were kept in a pathogen-free
environment with free access to food and water.
Materials
PTE, ZnPP (a specific HO-1 inhibitor), methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium
(MTT), and 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (2′-7′-
DCFH-DA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Antibodies against cytochrome c and β-actin
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA, USA). Control siRNA, HO-1 siRNA, and antibodies
against HO-1, NQO1, and GST were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) kits were purchased from Roche (Mannheim,
Germany). The kit for measuring lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) was purchased from Biovision (San Francisco, CA,
USA). The rabbit anti-goat, goat anti-rabbit, and goat antimouse
secondary antibodies were purchased from the
Zhongshan Company (Beijing, China).
Preparation of Cerebral IR Model In Vivo
Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane (3 %
induction, 1.5 % maintenance, v/v) in 30 % oxygen and
70 % nitrous oxide. Bilateral common carotid arteries were
isolated and occluded with non-traumatic aneurysm clips.
Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by a laser
Doppler flowmeter. After 20-min occlusion, the clips were

removed and skin incision was sutured. Only animals whose
regional cerebral blood flow decreased to 15 % of baseline
value were included in this study. Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37.0±0.5 °C by a feedback-controlled heating
pad. After operation, mice were kept in a warm incubator
(37.0 °C) for 2 h and then returned to cages at room
temperature.
Preparation of HT22 Neuron Cells and SIR Treatment
In Vitro
Murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing
10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and
200 mM streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen) and then maintained
at 90–95%relativehumidityin5%CO
2
at 37 °C. The
culture medium was renewed every 3 days. As described previously
[3], the simulated ischemia reperfusion (SIR) was performed
using concentrations of potassium, hydrogen, and lactate
similar to those that occur in vivo. Briefly, the HT22 cells
(1×105/mL) were exposed to an ischemic buffer containing
the following reagents (in mM): NaCl (137), KCl (12), MgCl
2
(0.49), CaCl
2
·2H
2
O(0.9),andHEPES(4).Thisbufferwas
also supplemented with the following compounds (in mM):
deoxyglucose (10), sodium dithionate (0.75), and lactate (20).
The buffer pH was 6.5, and the cells were incubated for 2 h in
a humidified cell culture incubator (21 % oxygen, 5 % CO
2
,
37 °C). Reperfusion was initiated by returning to normal culture
medium for 6 h.
Experimental Protocol
Step 1: Evaluate the effects of PTE on normal mice brains and
HT22 cells. The mice were randomly divided into control and
PTE (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) groups (n=8); PTE or control
groups (0.05 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) diluted with
0.9 % NaCl were administered intraperitoneally every day
(total 5 days). A full 24 h after the last injection of PTE, further
detections were carried out. The HT22 cells were divided into
control and PTE (1.25, 2.5, or 5 μM) groups (n=8), PTE or
control groups (0.01 % DMSO) which were diluted with
DMEM. After another 24 h of incubation for the PTE group,
further detections were carried out.
Step 2: Investigate whether PTE pretreatment alleviates
cerebral IRI in vivo and in vitro. The mice were randomly
divided into IR and PTE (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg)+IR groups
(n=8). Before IR, the mice were administered intraperitoneally
with PTE per day for 5 days. The HT22 cells were randomly
divided into SIR and PTE (1.25, 2.5, or 5μM)+SIR groups
(n=8). Before SIR, the cells were treated with PTE for 2 h.
Step 3: Investigate the role of HO-1 in cerebral protection
after PTE pretreatment in vivo. The mice were randomly divided
into IR, PTE+IR, PTE+ZnPP+IR, and ZnPP+IR
groups (n=8). Before the IR procedure, PTE was administered
intraperitoneally in doses of 10 mg/kg body weight per day for
5 days. The concentration of ZnPP was selected based on our
previous study [22]; ZnPP (3 mg/kg) diluted with 0.9 % NaCl
was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia.
Further experiments were preformed 24 h after ischemia.
Step 4: Investigate the role of HO-1 in cerebral protection
after PTE pretreatment in vitro. The HT22 cells were randomly
divided into control siRNA+SIR, control siRNA+PTE
(5 μM)+SIR, HO-1 siRNA+PTE (5 μM)+SIR, and HO-1
siRNA+SIR groups (n=8). The cells were transiently
transfected with control siRNA or HO-1 siRNA at 50 pM
for 24 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in OPTI-MEM media
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), then were treated with or withoutPTEfor2h.Furtherexperimentswereperformed6hafter
simulated ischemia.
Neurological Scores Assay In Vivo
The neurological scores assay of each mouse was evaluated
by a previously published scale [8]. After 24-h recovery of
surgery, mice were subjected to a modified neurological evaluation
to assess motor deficits. Briefly, mice were placed on a
10×20 cm screen (grid size 0.2×0.2 cm) that could be rotated
from 0° (horizontal) to 90° (vertical). The mouse was placed
on the horizontal screen, and the screen was then rotated into
the vertical plane. The duration of time that the mouse was
able to hold on to the vertical screen was recorded for a maximum
of 15 s (allowing a total of three points). Next, the
mouse was placed at the center of a horizontal wooden rod
(1.5 cm in diameter), and the time that the mouse was able to
remain balanced on the rod was recorded for a maximum of
30 s (allowing a total of three points). Finally, a prehensile
traction test was administered. The time that the mouse was
able to cling to a horizontal rope was recorded for a maximum
of 5 s. From these tests, a total motor score (TMS) (nine
possible points) was computed. The neurological scores were
detected by observers who were blinded to groups.
Brain Water and Ion Content Assay In Vivo
At 24 h after ischemia, animals were re-anesthetized and the
brains were removed and quickly divided into three parts:
right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and cerebellum. As described
previously [34], right hemisphere and left hemisphere
were obtained for further detection. Tissue samples were immediately
weighed to obtain the wet weight. Samples were
dried in a gravity oven at 95 to 100 °C for 24 h to determine
dry weight. Tissue water content (%) was calculated as ([wet
weight−dry weight] / wet weight)×100 %. Dehydrated brain
samples were digested in 1 mL of 1 N nitric acid for 2 weeks.

The sodium ion content of this solution was measured by
flame photometry and expressed in milli-equivalents.
NeuN and TUNEL Assay
As described previously [35], 24 h after global ischemia, mice
were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and
transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) and followed by ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde
(w/v) in PBS. Brains were removed, placed in the same
fixative at 4 °C overnight, dehydrated with graded concentrations
of alcohol, and then embedded in paraffin. After that,
paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned on a microtome
(Leica, Germany) into 5-μm coronal sections through the entire
dorsal hippocampus (1.4–1.8 mm posterior from bregma
in reference to a mouse brain atlas), and sections were
mounted onto poly lysine-coated slides. The sections were
dewaxed, dehydrated, and treated with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide
(H
2
O
2
) in PBS for 30 min. For antigen retrieval, the
sections were placed in 400-mL jars filled with citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) and boiled for 3 min. Then, they were permeabilized
using 0.4 % Triton X-100-PBS for 10 min and blocked with
10 % normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. The
sections were next incubated with diluted rabbit anti-NeuN
(1:100, Millipore, USA) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, they
were treated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(1:200, Invitrogen, USA) for 2 h at room temperature.
Immunofluorescent images were taken from the hippocampal
CA1 region using a BX51 light microscope (Olympus, Japan).
The number of NeuN-positive CA1 neurons was counted in a
250×250 μm square applied approximately at the center of
the CA1 region in each condition. Cell counts were performed
by an investigator who was blind to treatment groups.
For TUNEL staining, brain sections or HT22 cells were
placed on slides and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture
including enzyme solution (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
) and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled TUNEL-positive
nucleotides in a dark humidified chamber for 1 h at 37 °C,
followed by a final wash for 3×5 min with PBS and then
covered with water-based mounting medium. The captured
images were taken from the hippocampal CA1 region using
a BX51 light microscope (Olympus, Japan). The TUNEL-
positive cells that displayed green nuclear staining and all of
the cells with blue nuclear DAPI staining were counted within
five randomly chosen fields under high power magnification.
The index of apoptosis was expressed as the ratio of positively
stained apoptotic cells to the total number of cells counted×
100 %.
Cell Viability Assay
An MTT assay was performed to assess the viability of the
HT22 cells. After the cells were treated and washed with PBS,
100 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT solution in phenol red-free
DMEM was added to the cells, and the samples were incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C. Finally, 100 μL of N,N-
dimethylformamide was added to each well, and the samples
were shaken for 15 min at 37 °C. The results were analyzed at
490 nm using aspectramax M5 microplate reader (Molecular
Device, USA), and the cell viability was expressed in terms of
the optical density (OD). In addition, the cell morphology was
observed under an inverted/phase contrast microscope, and
images were taken with an Olympus BX61 microscope
(Japan).
Cell Death Assay
Cell death was assessed based on the amount of LDH with the
LDH released. Culture medium was collected for measurement
of LDH leakage. Ten microliters of supernatant was
transferred to a 96-well plate, LDH reaction mix was added
to each well, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. The reaction was stopped, and absorbance was
read at 450 nm. To assess total LDH activity, the cells were
incubated with 100μL of lysis solution per well for 30 min at
37 °C, and then, the lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular
debris. LDH release is expressed as a percentage of total
LDH.
Isolation of Mitochondria and Cytosolic Fraction
Mitochondria were isolated according to the procedure described
previously [36]. The brain regions or HT22 cells were
homogenized in an ice-cold isolation buffer (0.25 mM sucrose
, 1 mM K-EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with a
Teflon pestle. The homogenate was immediately centrifuged
at×2000×g for 3 min, the supernatant was centrifuged again
at×2000×g for 3 min, and the second supernatant was
decanted and centrifuged at×12,000×gfor 8 min. The supernatant
was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation
buffer without K-EDTA. Then, the suspension was centrifuged
at×12,000×gfor 10 min. The resulting brown mitochondrial
pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. The supernatant
represented the cytosolic fraction. The previously
mentioned procedures were all carried out at 0–4 °C. 
Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were stored at −20 °C
until use.
Measurement of MMP
As described previously [37], mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP) was determined using JC-1. Mitochondria samples
(0.5 mg/mL, 1 mL) were incubated with 19 mL JC-1
staining buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). At the end of the experiments
, valinomycin was added as a negative control.

Fluorescent intensity was determined at 37 °C in a fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Tecan, Switzerland). The ratio of
aggregates (red in the web version, 590 nm) to monomer
(green in the web version, 525 nm) was calculated as an indicatorofMMP.
Mitochondrial ROS Production
As described previously [37], mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production was measured using the indicator
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described. Mitochondrial protein was
incubated in a total volume of 200 μL respiration buffer including
5 mM pyruvate and 2.5 mM malate as substrate at
37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 10μM H2DCFDA, which
was made fresh before each use. Negative controls in which
mitochondrial samples were omitted were used for nonspecific
sources of ROS were background subtracted from
all experimental samples. The relative amount of mitochondrial

and free radical production was measured using a
plate reader with 490 nm excitation and 526 nm emission
filters. Wells containing known amounts of H
2
O
2
were used
as positive controls and for linear calibration of each plate.
Mitochondria Complex I Activity Assay
Mitochondria complex I was measured spectrophotometrically
, according to previous reports [38]. This method involves
catalytic oxidation of NADH to NAD+ with the subsequent
reduction of cytochrome c. The reaction mixture contained
0.2 M glycyl glycine buffer pH 8.5, 6 mM NADH in 2 mM
glycyl glycine buffer and 10.5 mM cytochrome c. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of requisite amount of solubilized
mitochondrial sample and followed absorbance
change at 550 nm for 2 min.
Mitochondria Complex IVActivity Assay
Mitochondria complex IV activity was assayed according to
previous report [39]. The assay mixture contained 0.3 mM
reduced cytochrome c in 75 mM phosphate buffer. The reaction
was started by the addition of solubilized mitochondrial
sample, and absorbance change was recorded at 550 nm for
2min.
Western Blot Analysis
The brain or cell samples (total, cytosolic, or mitochondrial)
were homogenized in lysis buffer and 1 % protease inhibitor
cocktail. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000×
g, and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube
and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentrations were determined
using a Bradford protein assay kit, and the proteins
were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in
Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST, pH 7.6) containing
5 % non-fat dry milk and were then incubated overnight at
4 °C with antibodies against HO-1, NQO1, GST (1:500 dilution
) cytochrome c, andβ-actin (1:1000 dilution), followed by
washes with TBST. The membranes were then probed with
appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution) at room
temperature for 90 min and washed with TBST. The protein
bands were detected using a Bio-Rad imaging system (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and quantified using the Quantity
One software package (West Berkeley, CA, USA). The Sham
group or IR (or SIR) group was defined as 100 %.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism-5 statistic software
(LaJolla, CA, USA). All of the values are presented as the
mean±the standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way
ANOVA was conducted across all investigated groups first.
Post hoc tests were then performed using Bonferroni correction
, and all two-group comparisons were made. The data
presented in Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 were determined by twoway
ANOVA. A difference of P<0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

The Effects of PTE on Neurological Scorings, Brain
Edema, and Ion Content in IR-Injured Brains
The values for neurological scores (Fig. 3a), brain edema
(Fig. 3b), and ion content (Fig. 3c) in the IR group were 5.60
±0.66, 80.35±0.48 %, and 316.40±20.72 mEq/kg dry weight,
respectively. PTE (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) treatment significantly
increased the neurological scores and decreased the brain edema
and ion content in a dose-dependent manner (vs. the IR
group, P<0.01). These effects were obvious with 10 mg/kg
PTE, which increased the neurological scores to 7.80±0.60
and decreased the brain edema and ion content to 78.21±
0.25 % and 204.21±10.62 mEq/kg dry weight, respectively.
The Effects of PTE on Neuron Survival and the Apoptotic
Ratio in IR-Injured Brains
As described previously [34], NeuN staining is used to mark
viable neurons, and TUNEL stainingisusedtomarkapoptotic
cells. The number of NeuN-positive cells (Fig. 4a) and TUNEL-
positive cells (Fig. 4b) in the IR group were 15.24±3.16 and
70.59±4.73 %, respectively. After 5 days post-injection, PTE
(2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) treatment significantly increased the number
of NeuN-positive cells and decreased the number of TUNEL-
positive cells (vs. the IR group, P<0.01). These effects were
obvious with 10 mg/kg PTE, which increased the number of
NeuN-positive cells to 62.33±4.41 % and decreased the
TUNEL-positive cells to 32.98±3.38 %.
The Effects of PTE on HO-1, NQO1, and GST Expression
in IR-Injured Brains
As shown in Fig. 5a, PTE treatment significantly increased
HO-1, NQO1, and GST expression (vs. the IR group,
P<0.01). These effects were obvious with 10 mg/kg PTE,
which separately increased the HO-1, NQO1, and GST expression
to 471.90±26.04, 360.75.02±20.13, and 295.32±
17.26 %, respectively.
The Effects of PTE on Mitochondrial Oxidative Damage
Indicators in IR-Injured Brains
A reduction in mitochondrial complex I or IV activity may
lead to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency and may
result in ROS overproduction [34–36]. Compared with the
IR group, PTE treatment significantly increased the MMP
(Fig. 5b), complex I activity (Fig. 5d), complex IV activity
(Fig. 5e), and mitochondrial cytochrome c expression
(Fig. 5a) (vs. the IR group, P<0.01); PTE also decreased
mitochondrial ROS production (Fig. 5c) and cytosolic cytochrome
c expression (Fig. 5a) (vs. the IR group, P<0.01).
These effects were obvious with 10 mg/kg PTE, which separately
increased the MMP, complex I activity, complex IV

Discussion
PTE, a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol from blueberries
, possesses a variety of pharmacological and biological
properties and potentially mediates cerebral protection [13,
14, 17–19, 15, 16]. Chang and colleagues found that at
equivalent and diet-achievable doses, pterostilbene is a more
potent modulator of aging and Alzheimer’s disease than resveratrol
, which is likely driven by increased peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression and increased
lipophilicity due to the substitution of a hydroxy group with a
methoxy group in pterostilbene [13]. Hou and colleagues indicated
that PTE can attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced
learning and memory impairments, which may be associated
with the inhibitory effect of PTE on microglia activation and
the protective effect against neuronal injury [17].
Additionally, PTE has also been demonstrated to be beneficial
for anxiety disorders and age-related cognitive disorders [18,

19]. However, the effects of PTE on cerebral IRI have not
been elucidated. In our study, PTE treatment conferred a cerebral
protective effect, which was demonstrated by increased
neurological scores and neuron viability as well as by decreased
brain edema, ion content, and apoptotic ratio
in vivo. PTE also increased cell viability and decreased
LDH leakage as well as the apoptotic ratio in vitro.
NQO1 is an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the twoelectron
reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. This antioxidant
flavoprotein is highly inducible by many stimuli, including
electrophilic metabolites and oxidative stress [40]. NQO1
has been reported to facilitate protection against renal IRI by
decreasing ROS-producing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity [41]. NQO1 also
plays critical roles in mitochondrial function, including maintaining
the MMP [42], attenuating mitochondrial depolarization
, and preventing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion
[43]. GSTs are best known for their ability to catalyze the
conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic
substrates for detoxification [44]. GST Pi 1 (GSTP1),
the most abundant member of the GST family, has been identified
as a negative regulator of cyclin-dependent kinase-5
(Cdk5), which promotes neuronal death and increases infarctions
following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
[45]. Notably, mitochondrial GSTs display both glutathione
transferase and peroxidase activities that detoxify harmful
products through GSH conjugation or GSH-mediated peroxide
reduction [46]. Recent studies have shown that microsomal
GST1 (MGST1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane
could interact with mitochondrial permeability transition regulators
[47]. HO-1, combined with potent AREs in the HO-1
promoter, is a highly effective therapeutic target for protection
against cerebral IRI. The HO-1 signaling pathway has been
shown to be protective in many pathological conditions associated
with the classical antioxidant molecules NQO1 and
GST [24–26]. The induction of HO-1 protein expression
may contribute to cellular defense against ischemic damage
in brain regions where the potential ability to synthesize HO-1
is retained in ischemia [48]. Furthermore, the overexpression
of HO-1 in transgenic mice is protective against permanent
MCA occlusion [49], whereas reduced HO-1 expression is
associated with more severe neurodegeneration after transient
ischemia induced by cortical compression in diabetic rats [50].
Moreover, various pharmacological treatments that exert beneficial
effects against ischemic damage are associated with
increased HO-1 expression, including resveratrol [27–29].
Interestingly, the pharmacological effects of PTE can be
achieved through the regulation of HO-1 signaling. For example
, Bhakkiyalakshmi and colleagues showed that the therapeutic
potential of HO-1 activation by PTE is a promising
approach to safeguard pancreatic beta-cells against oxidative
damage in diabetes [28]. Another study also confirmed that
PTE is more potent than resveratrol in preventing
azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis via the activation
of the HO-1-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway [29].
However, whether HO-1 signaling mediates the protective
effect of PTE against cerebral IRI has not been clarified. In
this study, PTE treatment significantly increased HO-1,
NQO1, and GST expression, whereas ZnPP and HO-1
siRNA blocked PTE-mediated cerebral protection by
inhibiting HO-1 signaling and further inhibited NQO1 and
GST induced by PTE. Above all, the cerebral protection of
PTE pretreatment is based on the activation of HO-1
signaling.
Studies have demonstrated that HO-1 activation reduces
oxidative stress and maintains mitochondrial function. For
example, soy isoflavone can alleviate oxidative damage and
maintain the redox imbalance in brain mitochondria damaged
by beta-amyloid peptides 1–42 (Aβ1–42). This effect might
result from the regulation of HO-1 signaling [31]. Another
study showed that guanosine protects human neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells against mitochondrial oxidative stress by inducing
HO-1 signaling [33]. It is worth noting that the protective
effects of PTE are ascribed to its strong activity against
mitochondrial oxidative damage. For example, PTE protects
vascular endothelial cells against oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced
apoptosis through preserving MMP and decreasing cytochrome c release [51]. PTE also exhibited strong
antioxidant activity against various free radicals, such as 1,1-
diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-
ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), hydroxyl, superoxide,
and hydrogen peroxide, in a concentration-dependent manner.
PTE conferred protection to proteins, lipids, and DNA in isolated
mitochondrial fractions against tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) and hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative damage
[52]. In this study, we investigated the redox status of
mitochondria in brains or HT22 neuron cells. The results
clearly indicated that PTE treatment resulted in a wellpreserved
MMP, mitochondria complex I activity, mitochondria
complex IVactivity, and mitochondrial cytochrome c expression
and decreased cytosolic cytochrome c expression.
Mitochondrial oxidative damage has been directly implicated
in a variety of pathological situations, including cerebral IRI
[36, 37]. The occurrence of mitochondrial oxidative damage
contributes to an increased loss of efficiency in mitochondrial
function, which further improves mitochondrial oxidative
damage and ultimately aggravates cerebral IRI. However,
the improved mitochondrial function due to PTE treatment
was eliminated by ZnPP or HO-1 siRNA, which indicates that
HO-1 activation by PTE attenuates cerebral IR-induced mitochondrial
oxidative damage.
In summary, our findings in mouse brains and in HT22
neuron cells suggest that PTE treatment exerts a profound
cerebral-protective effect against IRI. This protection appears
to be largely due to the activation of HO-1 signaling and to the
attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative damage. The activation
