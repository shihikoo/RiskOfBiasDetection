Abstract
Cerebrovascular diseases are significant causes of death and disability in humans. Improvements in diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches strongly rely on adequate gyrencephalic, large animal models being demanded for translational
research. Ovine stroke models may represent a promising approach but are currently limited by insufficient knowledge
regarding the venous system of the cerebral angioarchitecture. The present study was intended to provide a
comprehensive anatomical analysis of the intracranial venous system in sheep as a reliable basis for the interpretation of
experimental results in such ovine models. We used corrosion casts as well as contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
venography to scrutinize blood drainage from the brain. This combined approach yielded detailed and, to some extent,
novel findings. In particular, we provide evidence for chordae Willisii and lateral venous lacunae, and report on connections
between the dorsal and ventral sinuses in this species. For the first time, we also describe venous confluences in the deep
cerebral venous system and an ‘anterior condylar confluent’ as seen in humans. This report provides a detailed reference for
the interpretation of venous diagnostic imaging findings in sheep, including an assessment of structure detectability by
in vivo (imaging) versus ex vivo (corrosion cast) visualization methods. Moreover, it features a comprehensive interspeciescomparison
of the venous cerebral angioarchitecture in man, rodents, canines and sheep as a relevant large animal model
species, and describes possible implications for translational cerebrovascular research.

Introduction
Cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke and cerebral
venous thrombosis (CVT) are major causes of mortality and
neurological disabilities in adulthood. Thrombolysis is the most
important and sometimes only therapeutic option for occlusive
cerebrovascular diseases. While the treatment is restricted by a
relatively narrow time window and a number of contraindications
[1] in ischemic stroke, its use for cerebrovascular thrombosis
remains a matter of debate [2,3]. Thus, there is an unmet need for
additional therapeutic options to arise from preclinical research.
Predictive animal models are crucial to assess the safety and
efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches for human patients [4].
During the last decade, large animal models of cerebrovascular
diseases [5,6] and neurosurgical interventions [7] became increasingly
relevant. In particular, a number of sheep models emerged
[8,9] since this species was found highly practicable for translational
research. Among such models, experimental middle
cerebral artery occlusion has been described [10,11] and,
consequently the intracranial ovine arterial angioarchitecture has
been studied in detail [12,13]. However, little is known about the
venous drainage in the sheep although important anatomical
differences to other species including humans may limit the use of
ovine cerebrovascular disease models. Since profound anatomical
knowledge is an important prerequisite for translational research,
the present study aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of the
ovine intracranial venous blood system and its connections to
extracranial veins. Beyond a detailed anatomical description
including hitherto unknown structures in sheep and a comprehensive
inter-species comparison of the venous vasculature, this
study evaluates the applicability and accuracy of clinical imaging
techniques to provide a reliable reference for further translational
research on cerebrovascular pathologies in this species.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement and Vascular Corrosion Casting
All animal experiments (n = 14) were approved by the
responsible federal animal welfare authority at the Regional
Board Saxony, Detachment Leipzig, Department 24: veterinary
affairs and animal welfare (protocol numbers TVV 33/04 and
TVV 26/09) and performed in accordance with the guidelines of
the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate
Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes.
Venous corrosion casts were prepared from Merino ewes (n = 10),
previously subjected to experimental surgery unrelated to the head
and the vascular system. Four additional animals were subjected to
both MRI and CT imaging.
Sheep were sacrificed by an intravenous injection of 20%
hydroxyl-butyramid, 5% mebezonium iodide, and 0.5% tetracaine
hydrochloride (T61, Hoechst Roussel; 0.3 ml/kg body weight).
After confirmed death, animals were decapitated between the
second and third cervical vertebrae. The external jugular veins
were carefully dissected and cannulated with 6-mm metallic bulbheaded
cannulas followed by manual injection of methyl
methacrylate (Kallocryl; Speiko – Dr. Speier GmbH, Germany).
The heads were stored at 4uC for 24 hours to allow polymerisation
of the injected resin. Maceration was performed with pepsinhydrochloric
acid and amylase/protease solution (Biozym SE,
10%) at 50uC until all soft tissues were dissolved. Thereafter, the
skulls were trepanated and two paramedian bone plates of 96 4 cm 
were removed.
Magnetic Resonance and Computed Tomography
Vascular Imaging
Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and computed tomography
venography (CTV) were performed under general anaesthesia
in four additional Merino ewes. Immediately after induction
of anaesthesia, sheep were intubated and mechanically ventilated
(Servo 900 D ventilator, Siemens, Germany). Table 1 provides
details on medication schemes and contrast agents used.
Contrast enhanced MRV was performed using a 3T MRI
Scanner (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
equipped with a surface flex coil. The following imaging
parameters were applied: FLASH 3D, TR 3.25 s, TE 1.4 s, flip
angle 19, slice thickness 1.2 mm, resulting in a voxel size of
0.56 0.56 1.2 mm.

The dorsal sagittal sinus (DSS) was the major cerebral venous drainage
of the dorsal sinus system. Along its course, the DSS received
ethmoidal, cerebral, meningeal, and diploic veins from the skull. Its
superficial profile showed an axial groove over the whole length and
nodular protrusions on the caudal one-third of the DSS (B, arrowheads).
(C) Corrosion cast, lateral left view. The confluences of the dorsal

CTV was performed with a 64 channel MDCT (Brilliance 64,
Philips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany) under the following
imaging parameters: 0.8 mm slice thickness, 0.4 mm increment,
120 kV, 300 mAs, resulting in a voxel size of 0.56 0.56 0.8 mm.
Imaging reconstructions and further processing were conducted
using the Osirix 2.8 freeware (Osirix, Geneva, Switzerland).
Comparison of Structure Detectability
To investigate sensitivity and specificity of corrosion casts and
MRV, a semi-quantitative score system was applied. The
visualization of venous structures was categorized as not detectable
(2), barely visible (+), moderately visible (++) and distinctly visible
(+++). In cases not allowing clear interpretation, CTV was
performed as an independent imaging modality.
Results
All structure designations and abbreviations are given in table
S1, providing termini as used in the Nomina Anatomica
Veterinaria (NAV) and in both the Nomina Anatomica (NA)
and the Terminologia Anatomica (TA).
Morphology of the Dorsal Sagittal Sinus
The dorsal sagittal sinus (DSS, Fig. 1A, 1B) collects blood from
the dorsal parts of the brain and skull. It originates at the crista
galli of the ethmoid bone (Fig. 1B) and runs within the falx cerebri
to the internal occipital protuberance (Fig. 1B, 1C; for MRV see
Fig. 7B). Corrosion casts unveiled a longitudinal median groove
over its entire course. Nodular protrusions were seen in the caudal
third, but not in the rostral part (Fig. 1B). Corrosion casts also
provided evidence of trabecular structures (chordae Willisii) within
the DSS, which prevented a complete filling of the vascular lumen.
Due to those structures, discrete foci of contrast agent filling
defects were detected in axial MRV projections (Fig. 6B). The
DSS received inflow from the ethmoidal veins (EV) (rostrally;
Fig. 1A –1C; for MRV see Fig. 5B and Fig. 6D), the dorsal
cerebral veins (DCV) (laterally; Fig. 1A –1D; for MRV see Fig. 5C
and Fig. 6B) and both diploic and meningeal veins (dorsally). DCV
were connected to lateral, pinhead-size expansions of lateral
venous lacunae (LVLs) of the DSS (Fig. 1A, 1C –1E). The DSS
received the straight sinus (SS) and split into the bilateral
transverse sinus (TrS) (Fig. 1A, 1B). This point of venous
confluence is called confluence of sinus (Fig. 2C, 2D).
Deep Cerebral Venous System
Both thalamostriate veins (TSVs) were identified by their
convergent, dorsally convex course in a rostromedial direction in
corrosion casts and MRV images. It was clearly visible in
corrosion casts that each TSV received further venous input from
the vein of the septum pellucidum (VSP), the choroidal vein (ChV)
and the veins of caudate nucleus (VCN) (Fig. 2A, 2B). The VSP,
running rostroventrally to caudodorsally into the TSV, and the
ChV being characterized by its typical ‘brush-like’ appearance
(numerous short branches) (Fig. 2A, 2B), were clearly identified in
corrosion casts but not by MRV. Likewise, the VCNs were only
visible in corrosion casts where they were found to drain draining
into the TSVs from rostral and lateral directions (Fig. 2A, 2B). The
coalescence of the TSV and the VSP on each side formed the
paired internal cerebral veins (ICV) (Fig. 2A, 2B) at the ‘confluens
venosus rostralis’. TSVs and their continuation into the ICV were
particularly apparent in MRV images (Fig. 7B –7D). After
bending backwards, the ICVs merged into the unpaired great
Figure 2. Deep cerebral venous system. (A) Schematic drawing of corrosion cast, lateral right view. The straight sinus (SS) was the venous
drainage route of the medial cortex, the corpus callosum, the basal ganglia and part of the diencephalon (A–E). (B) Corrosion cast, dorsolateral right
view. The unpaired great cerebral vein (GCV) was formed by both internal cerebral veins (ICV) in the ‘confluens venosus caudalis’ (A, B; white star). The
vein of corpus callosum (VCC) and the lateral vein (LV), with three tributaries, drained into the GCV. The ICVs originated from two distinct converging
branches in the ‘confluens venosus rostralis’ (A, B; white dots): the vein of the septum pellucidum (VSP) and the thalamostriate vein (TSV). The TSVs
received inflow from caudate nucleus veins (VCN; A, B) and from the choroidal vein (ChV; A, B). (C) MRV, sagittal section. (D) MRV, coronal section. The

cerebral vein (GCV) at the ‘confluens venosus caudalis’. Both veins
were clearly visible in corrosion casts as well as in MRV. The
GCV was found to be about 1.5 mm in diameter and between 7.0
and 8.0 mm in length. It runs caudally between the junctions of
the ICVs and the vein of corpus callosum (VCC) (Fig. 2A, 2B).
The GCV received input from the paired lateral veins (LV) of the
lateral ventricle and the unpaired VCC. The VCC was observed
as a large and conspicuous vein of about 4 cm length in corrosion
casts (Fig. 2B). It appeared as a very small vessel in CTV (Fig. 2E)
and was undetectable in MRV (Fig. 7B). Each LV received three
tributaries: a central vein (CeV) taking its course rostrally, a
dorsomedial basilar cerebral vein (DMBCV) running ventrally and
a rostral ventral cerebellar vein (RVCrV) taking its course caudally
(Fig. 2A, 2B). The DMBCV approached the ventral cerebral veins,
but no anastomoses between these vessels were observed in our
study. The fine LV branches could only be discriminated in
corrosion casts, but not by in vivo imaging. After entering the falx
cerebri, the GCV continued as the SS which ventrally joined the
caudal third of the DSS (Fig. 2A –2D; for MRV see Fig. 5F, 5G;
Fig. 7B).
Ventral Cerebral Veins
The basilar cerebral vein (BCV), being situated at the ventral
brain base, received inflow from the rostral cerebral vein (RCV)
and from the middle cerebral vein (MCV). This situation was
clearly visible in corrosion casts (Fig. 3A, 3D), but not in MRV
images. In the further course, the rhinal vein (RV) and the
piriform lobe vein (PLV) formed a main outflow track which
drained to the dorsal petrosal sinus (DPS) together with the BCV
(Fig. 3A, 3B). The RCV arose from fine branches in the rostral
cranial fossa near the ventral part of the crista galli (Fig. 3A, 3D),
run caudally over the orbitosphenoidal crest and merged with the
MCV (Fig. 3A, 3D), forming the BCV. The latter started dorsally
of the optic canal (Fig. 3A, 3C, 3D). Some minor vessels took their
course from the BCV in a ventromedial direction and anastomosed
with the cavernous sinus (CS) (AR2BCV+CS) (Fig. 3A,
Figure 3. Ventral cerebral veins and the anastomoses of the ventral sinus system. (A) Schematic drawing of corrosion cast, dorsal view.
The ventral cerebral veins included the basilar cerebral vein (BCV) and the rhinal vein (RV), which joined the dorsal petrosal sinus (DPS) as the main
drainage system of the ventral cerebral veins,. (B) Corrosion cast, dorsocaudal view. The piriform lobe vein (PLV) drained into the RV (A, B) whereas

3C, for MRV see Fig. 5G) as detected in corrosion casts. The RV
proceeded along the cerebral juga on the temporal brain surface
(Fig. 3A–3C) and ran in a caudally convex arch, receiving input
from the PLV before joining the DPS together with the BCV
(Fig. 3A–3C). Despite being clearly detectable in corrosion casts,
both veins were barely identifiable on MRV images (Fig. 5D, 5F;
Fig. 6F, 6G; Fig. 7C–7G). The pontine vein (PV) and the ventral
cerebellar veins (VCrV) also joined the DPS. The former emerged
at the pontine impression and ran in a caudolateral direction to
reach the DPS (Fig. 3A, 3C) rostrally of the confluence of the
VCrV (Fig. 3A, 3C). The PV and the VCrV could not be
visualized in MRV. The paired DPS joined the ipsilateral
transverse sinus and were well detectable in corrosion casts
(Fig. 3A –3C), and, to a limited extent, in MRV (Fig. 5H; Fig. 6D–
6G; Fig. 7D–7F).
Anastomoses of the Ventral Sinus System
The ventral sinus system encompassed a bilateral system of
three main sinuses in the middle and caudal cranial fossae (from
rostral to caudal): (1) the cavernous sinus (CS), (2) the ventral
petrosal sinus (VPS) and (3) the ventral occipital sinus (VOS)
(Fig. 3E, 3F; for MRV see Fig. 5E–5H, 5K; Fig. 6F–6J; Fig. 7B–
7E). The paired CS displayed a plexiform structure which
extended from the foramen orbitorotundum to the dorsum sellae.
The caudal intercavernous sinus (CIS), a prominent anastomosis
between caudal parts of the CS, was clearly identifiable in
Figure 4. Course of the emissary veins of the temporal sinus and the formation of the anterior condylar confluent. (A) 3D CT

(2) the second emissary vein (EVRF-2) which ran next to a tributary canal, passed a tributary foramen, and joined the profundal temporal vein (PTV).

which drained into the external jugular vein (EJV). (F) 3D CT scan, ventrolateral view. The ACC is a clearly visible structure in the sheep.ACC: anterior

corrosion casts (Fig. 3E, 3F) and MRV (Fig. 5F; Fig. 6J). A rostral
intercavernous sinus could not be detected in any specimen. The
CS emptied via an emissary vein through the foramen orbitorotundum
(EVOrF), connecting the CS to the extracranial
ophthalmic plexus (OP) (Fig. 6I). Another anastomotic branch
between CS and extracranial pterygoid plexus (PP) (AR2CS+PP),
which was also found to run through the foramen orbitorotundum
before turning laterally to the PP, was observed in corrosion casts
(data not shown) as well as in MRV (Fig. 5D; Fig. 6J; Fig. 7D).
This anastomosis has not been reported previously. The emissary
vein of the oval foramen (EVOvF) was connected to the PP as well
(Fig. 3E; for MRV see Fig. 5F, Fig. 6J; Fig. 7C). The CS continued
caudally as the paired VPS which proceeded in a caudo-ventral
direction. Before reaching the jugular foramen, the sinus was
found to connect with its fellow, the anastomotic ramus of the VPS
(AR-VPS) (Fig. 3E, 3F). The small-calibre AR-VPS was situated
within the occipital bone between the pontine and medullary
impressions and only visible in corrosion casts after bone removal.
The VPS tapered and partly emptied into the emissary vein of the
jugular foramen. The paired VOS, representing the caudal
extension of the VPS, were connected by an anastomotic vein
which passed the ventral boundary of the foramen magnum, the
anastomotic ramus of the VOS (AR-VOS) (Fig. 3E, 3F; for MRV
see Fig. 5K; Fig. 6I).
Course of the Emissary Veins of the Temporal Sinus and
Formation of the Anterior Condylar Confluent
On either side, the transverse sinus (TrS) split into a rostral
temporal sinus (TeS) and a caudal sigmoid sinus (SiS), clearly
visible in corrosion casts (Fig. 1A, 1B) and on MRV images
(Fig. 5G –5J; Fig. 6C; Fig. 7E –7H). The TeS entered the temporal
meatus in a rostro-ventral direction where it split into two distinct
vessels which emerged as emissary veins from the retroarticular
foramen. The first emissary vein ran through the main retroarticular
foramen (EVRF-1) and joined the maxillary vein (MV)
near the confluence of the superficial temporal vein (STV) (Fig. 4B,
4C; for MRV see Fig. 6E, 6F; Fig. 7H). The prominent second
emissary vein of the tributary retroarticular foramen (EVRF-2)
was found along the tributary canal inside the temporal fossa and
joined the deep temporal vein (PTV) as seen in both corrosion
casts (Fig. 4B, 4C) and MRV (Fig. 5F; Fig. 6E, Fig. 7H). The SiS
passed the condylar canal (CC) and drained into the VOS
(Fig. 6E). Thus, the SiS connected the dorsal with the ventral sinus
system. The VOS emptied into the internal vertebral venous
plexus and into the emissary vein of the hypoglossal canal which
left the skull through the hypoglossal canal. At the extracranial
opening, the emissary veins of the jugular foramen and of the
hypoglossal canal merged into a conspicuous, plexus-like structure
which was detectable in corrosion casts (Fig. 4B, 4D, 4E) and on
MRV images (Fig. 5J; Fig. 6I, 6J; Fig. 7D–7G). This structure is
described as the anterior condylar confluent (ACC) in humans. It
was located between the occipital condyle and the paracondylar
process of the occipital bone. The ACC was concealed by the
paracondylar process (Fig. 4D) in the lateral view. The ACC
emptied into the emissary vein of the jugular foramen and
hypoglossal canal (EVJFHC). The latter received the anastomotic
ramus of the vertebral vein (AR-VV) prior to continuing as the
craniooccipital vein (COV) which finally connected to the external
jugular vein (EJV, Fig. 4B, 4D –4E).
Detectability of Cerebral Venous Structures by the
Techniques Applied
A synopsis of the visibility of individual vessels in corrosion casts
and by means of MRV is summarized in table 2. In principle,
corrosion casts provide a superior visibility, particularly of very
small structures. CTV could, to some extent, be used to
compensate for occasional lack of detectability on MRV imaging.
Discussion
The major aim of the present study was to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the ovine intracranial venous system
by a combined approach using vascular corrosion casts and noninvasive in vivo imaging techniques. Relevant findings including
hitherto not described anatomical structures are summarized in
Fig. S1.

Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview on the cerebral
venous angioarchitecture in sheep, humans, dogs, and rats.
Significant differences in cerebral arterial blood supply exist
between rodents and humans. For example, numerous interarterial
anastomoses can prevent major cortical infarction after
distal (cortical) middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in most
non-hypertensive rodent strains [4]. These anastomoses are almost
completely missing in humans (and domestic mammals), and
occlusion of the MCA usually has disastrous consequences. Hence,
similar differences may be presumed for the venous system. The
cerebral venous drainage in rats and mice as the predominant
experimental species has not been described in much detail so far.
Some information is available for the Sprague-Dawley rat [14,15]
which was used as a reference in our species comparison. Given
the utmost importance of these species for basic cerebrovascular
research and the lack of literature covering this topic, the rodent
cerebral venous outflow tracks should be explored thoroughly in
further studies.
Canines represent an important model species used in
translational cerebrovascular and neurointerventional research,
since the anatomy of the arterial blood supply to the brain is very
Gadolinium (Dotarem) in comparison to the deep and ventral cerebral veins. Note the completely visible signals of the dorsal sagittal sinus (DSS; B–
G), the transverse sinus (TrS; G–I), the temporal sinus (TeS; G–I), the sigmoid sinus (SiS; I–K), the cavernous sinus (CS; D–G), the ventral petrosal sinus
(VPS; H), the ventral occipital sinus (VOS; K), the anterior condylar confluent (ACC; J), as well as the great cerebral vein (GCV; E, F) and the straight sinus
(SS, F, G). Note the faint signal of the thalamostriate veins (TSV; C, D), the internal cerebral veins (ICV, D), the basilar cerebral vein (BCV), and the dorsal
petrosal sinus (DPS; D, F, H). Two anastomotic rami could be seen in MRV strongly: the anastomotic ramus between cavernous sinus and pterygoid

similar to humans, though rich anastomoses may also exist in this
species [16]. Importantly, dogs lack a rete mirabile, a plexiform
arterial network arising from the maxillary artery and forming the
internal carotid artery, which is common in artiodactyls. Canines
are therefore a preferred species for experimental arterial
intravascular procedures. Anatomical and physiological similarities
of assessed venous structures in comparison to human anatomy
were slightly lower in dogs (16 out of 30) as compared to sheep (19
out of 30). Almost half of the structures (13 out of 30) have not
been described in the rat, indicating a significant lack of knowledge
about the species. Hence, the present study indicates a close
resemblance of the intracranial venous system between sheep and
man. The following paragraphs discuss functional and anatomical
differences in selected venous structures between large animals and
humans in more detail.

Morphology of the Dorsal Sagittal Sinus
The DSS is the main drainage system of the dorsal sinus system.
In Merino sheep, it starts with the fusion of two to three dorsal
rostral cerebral veins and collects blood from the DCV and from
diploic veins [17]. This is similar to the situation in other domestic
ruminants [17] and in humans, where the superior cerebral veins
deliver blood to the superior sagittal sinus [18]. Variants have been
described for dogs [19]. In canines, anastomoses between the
rostral branches of the dorsal cerebral veins with branches of the
RV have been reported [20], but no such variations were seen in
our study. Moreover, some fine branches of ethmoidal veins
delivered blood from the region of the crista galli to the DSS in our
specimens. LVLs of the DSS have been described in humans
[21,22], monkeys [23], and dogs [20]. In humans, the LVLs
collect blood predominantly from the meningeal veins, but not
from the cortical veins [24]. In contrast, the LVL were found to
connect the DCV with the DSS in Merino sheep. Several types of
chordae Willisii have been distinguished by using standard
anatomical methods [21,25]. Our results corroborated these
findings, with chordae displaying a trabecular, longitudinal or
valve-like shape in sheep. Chordae Willisii in the median plane
may functionally form a septum with trabecular and valve-like
formations as seen in MRV. The latter are considered to prevent
reverse blood flows and are also the most frequent type seen in
humans [25]. In animals, the confluence of sinuses comprises the
DSS, SS and TrS, whereas it encompasses the superior sagittal
sinus, straight sinus, occipital sinus and transverse sinus in humans
[26].
Deep Cerebral Venous System
In humans, the SS is connected either with the confluence of
sinuses or, more commonly, with the left TrS [24]. The SS
connected with the confluence of sinuses in Merino sheep, which is
congruent with previous findings [27]. The VCC was very
prominent in ovine corrosion casts, but less prominent in MRV
and CTV, and may easily be confused with the human inferior
sagittal sinus. The LVs, previously undescribed for sheep, joined
the great cerebral vein. This is in contrast to the human anatomy,
were LVs drain into ICVs. Ovine LVs receive inflow from three
tributaries, which directly drain into the GCV in canines [20],
omitting LVs. The human equivalent of the ‘confluens venosus
posterior’ is the ‘confluens venosus caudalis’. The ‘confluens
venosus posterior’ in humans is formed of the GCV of Galen, as a
merge of the internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal
[18]. In contrast, only the ICVs participate in the formation of the
GCV in sheep. This formation has not been described in animals
so far and, with respect to the human situation, may be
denominated as ‘confluens venosus caudalis’. Another formation,

sagittal sinus (DSS) after intravenous injection of Gadolinium (Dotarem)
as a result of the chordae Willisii (B). A better detectability of the deep
and ventral cerebral veins can be observed in the axial slices. The great
cerebral vein (GCV) and the straight sinus (SS) were completely visible
(C–E), the thalamostriate vein (TSV) and the internal cerebral vein (ICV)
were moderately visible (C–F), but no evidence of the vein of septum
pellucidum (VSP) or choroidal veins (ChVs) was found. The visualization
of the basilar cerebral vein (BCV) and the rhinal vein (RV) were barely
visible and the dorsal petrosal sinus (DPS) was moderately conspicuous
in MRV (C–G). The first emissary vein of retroarticular foramen (EVRF-1)
was a moderately visible vein (E, F). The second emissary vein of
retroarticular foramen (EVRF-2) was a noticeable vessel which passed
the tributary canal of the temporal meatus and drained into the
profundal temporal vein (PTV; E–H). The butterfly-shaped cavernous
sinus (CS) could be regarded as a venous crossroad with star-shaped
connections to intra- and extracranial veins (I, J). From rostral to caudal,
these were: (1) the emissary vein of orbitorotund foramen (EVOrF; I)
with the ophthalmic plexus (OP; I); (2) the anastomotic ramus between
cavernous sinus and pterygoid plexus (PP) (AR-CS+PP; J); (3) the
emissary vein of the oval foramen (EVOvF; J) with the PP; (4) the ventral
petrosal sinus (VPS; I) and (5) the caudal intercavernous sinus (CIS; J).

called ‘confluens venosus anterior’ or ‘venous angle’ in humans,
characterizes the confluence of the anterior septal vein with the
TSV, giving rise to the internal cerebral vein [28,29]. Of all
subependymal veins, the TSV is best described since it is most
evident in angiography [30]. The venous angle was formed by the
point of origin of ICV at the thalamic tubercle, as seen in lateral
views of cerebral angiograms by Kilic ¸ & Akakin [29]. These
authors also described anatomical variations regarding subependymal
veins in the region of the foramen of Monro by means of
MR time of flight venography. Here, MRV and CTV were proven
ineffective to visualize the VSP, but C ¸ ims ¸it et al. [28] provided
excellent images of the anterior septal vein by using MR time of
flight which allows the detection of vessels with relatively slow
blood flow.
Ventral Cerebral Veins
The ventral cerebral veins are a group of veins which drain the
rhinencephalon and enter the DPS, whereas the BCV is situated in
the immediate vicinity of the arterial circle of Willis. This also
applies to the RCV and MCV, which accompany the rostral and
middle cerebral artery [17]. Several anastomoses to the more
dorsal sinus system were noted in dogs [20]. In sheep, we found a
correspondence to the RCV and the MCV. The basal vein in dogs
continues on the lateral side of the cerebral peduncle and splits
into dorsomedial and dorsolateral basal veins as described by
Armstrong and Horowitz [20]. These authors also reported
anastomoses between the dorsomedial basal vein and the GCV as
well as between the basal vein and the cavernous sinus.
The first anastomosis could not be detected in our specimens.
However, we found an anastomosis between the BCV and the CS.
The basal vein in humans also commences at the anterior
perforate substance by merging of the anterior cerebral, middle
cerebral and striate veins [31]. The basal vein of each side takes its
course around the midbrain and connects to the ICV or GCV
[32]. The RV is the major vein of the ventral cerebral system and
drains the caudo-ventral part of the hemisphere. The vein is rarely
mentioned in the veterinary anatomy and has not been described
in humans. BCV and RV connected with the DPS as opposed to
the situation in humans, in which the basal vein empties into the
ICV or GCV.
Anastomoses of the Ventral Sinus System
The CS starts at the foramen orbitorotundum in sheep [33], but
at the orbital fissure in dogs [34]. It ends near the CIS. In humans,
the CS extends from the superior orbital fissure to the top of the
petrous pyramid [18]. The rostral intercavernous sinus is usually
absent in sheep [27]. We could not detect a rostral intercavernous
sinus, neither in corrosion casts nor in vivo by contrast-enhanced
MRV or CTV, but found a prominent CIS in all specimens. In
contrast to humans [18], however, no evidence of a completely
‘circular sinus’ was found in sheep. The rostral epidural rete
mirabile is situated in close vicinity to the dura mater and
invaginated into the CS [35,36]. The physiological function of this
formation is thought to be the chilling of arterial blood supply to
the brain. The absence of a rostral intercavernous sinus results in a
horseshoe-shaped conformation of the ventral sinus system in dogs
and sheep [27]. However, our data provide the first evidence for a
strong anastomosis between the CS and PP, unveiling an
additional outflow path from the CS. In our study, no evidence
of a basilar sinus was found and the connection with the ventral
internal vertebral plexus was established through the VOS.

thalamostriate vein (TSV; B, arrowheads) showed a cornu-like course
and drained into the conspicuous internal cerebral vein (ICV; B). The

be identified over a longer distances. BCVs and rhinal veins (RVs)
drained through the dorsal petrosal sinus (DPS; D, E, F) into the
transverse sinus (TrS; E, F, G). The TrS split into the temporal sinus (TeS)
and the sigmoid sinus (SiS; F–H). Note the clear illustration of the TrS,
TeS, SiS and the anterior condylar confluent (ACC; D–G). The ACC

Course of the Emissary Veins of the Temporal Sinus and

routes in Merino sheep. The first is an extracranial drainage from
the TeS to the MV through the main retroarticular foramen,
similar to the situation reported in dogs. The second is a strong
vein connecting the TeS with the PTV through the tributary canal
[17]. An anastomosis between the TeS and the OP, described by
Ko ¨nig [17], was neither seen in corrosion casts nor in MRV nor
CTV. The second emissary pattern may be limited to ruminants
(and horses) featuring a tributary canal of the temporal meatus of
the TeS which is not observed in other species. Another novel
finding in our study was a conspicuous, plexiform structure located
extracranially near the openings of the jugular foramen and
hypoglossal canal. To date, this venous confluent has only been
reported in humans as the ‘anterior condylar confluent’ (ACC)
[38,39]. It constitutes a vascular crossroad between the intracranial
venous sinuses of the caudal cranial fossa and the caudal
cervical outflow tracks. The size of the human ACC ranges from 3
to 5 mm in a longitudinal direction and amounts to approximately
2 mm in its ventro-dorsal extension as seen in MRV.
Anatomical Implications for Translational
Cerebrovascular Research
The anatomical similarity between sheep and humans might
provide a solid basis for translational research on cerebrovascular
diseases of the brain using ovine models. Notwithstanding, some
fundamental differences to the human anatomy and hemodynamic
physiology need to be considered carefully. For example,
encephalic drainage preferentially occurs through vertebral, but
not jugular veins in a physiological prone/upright position in both
sheep and man [39]. In most quadrupeds including sheep, the
longitudinal axes of skull and spine as well as those of major veins
in this area meet at an obtuse angle. This is in contrast to humans
where the longitudinal axes of skull and spine and major veins
meet at a right angle. When lying in a supine position, main
venous outflow shifts to the anterior, jugular tracks. This is a
physiological situation in humans and, due to the right angle in
which the venous vessels meet, does not cause any drainage
problems. However, when animals are placed in a non-physiological
supine position (e.g. for surgery or imaging procedures in
large bore clinical scanners) and/or the head is fixed in a reclined
position, both jugular and vertebral veins may become stretched
and kinked, severely reducing the venous drainage capacity. This
may lead to a significant backlog of venous blood and a
concomitant increase of the intracranial pressure, severely
damaging the brain over time.
Conclusions
Our study revealed novel aspects of the venous angioarchitecture
of ovine intracranial venous sinuses and veins by means of ex
vivo vascular corrosion casts, MRV and CTV. The detailed
anatomical information obtained approves the notion of sheep as a
relevant model species for translational research focussed on the
cerebrovascular system. It also provides important implications for
animal handling during such studies. An interspecies comparison
between sheep, dogs and rats suggests that the cerebral venous
angioarchitecture in large animals is better comparable with the
human anatomy although substantial differences remain.
