Abstract
Background Vasospasm of both large and small parenchymal
arteries may contribute to the occurrence of delayed ischemic
neurological deficits, and nitric oxide(NO) is an important mediators
in the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH). We used a rabbit two-hemorrhage
model to investigate changes in plasma NO after SAH, and
the relationship between NO and brain microcirculation.
Methods SAH was induced in rabbits and a control group was
sham operated. There were 32 rabbits in each group that
survived the second operation, and they were randomly
assigned to four groups of eight rabbits each for follow-up
assessments on Days 1, 4, 7, or 14, respectively. Cerebral
blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean
transit time (MTT) were calculated at six regions of interest
(ROIs): symmetrical areas of the frontal, parietal-occipital,
and temporal lobes. Before the contrast CT scan, blood was
drawn from the central artery of the ear for measurement of
plasma NO.
Results In the control group, there was no difference in CBV,
CBF, and MTT in the six ROIs, and plasma NO was unchanged.
Compared to controls, in the SAH group, CBV
decreased slightly in the six ROIs (P >0.05), frontal lobe
CBF decreased, MTT increased (P <0.05, for both), and NO
plasma levels were significantly lower (P <0.01).
Conclusions There was a significant correlation between the
increase in MTTand the decrease in plasma NO (P <0.05), We
hypothesized that normalization of NO might have a positive
influence on brain microcirculation following SAH.

Introduction
Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) remains one of the main causes for
poor clinical outcomes in patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH) [3]. After a single SAH, CVS often
occurs at three to four days, reaches its maximum incidence
and severity between six and eight days, and usually resolves
within 12 to14 days [1,3]. Angiographic vasospasm occurs in
30 to70 % of patients with SAH, but leads to delayed, clinically
evident ischemic neurological deficits in only 20-30 %
of patients. About half of these patients suffer severe permanent
neurological dysfunction or death [1]. However, the
disturbance of cerebral perfusion after SAH is caused not only
by proximal artery segment vasospasm, but also by vasospasm
of distal arteries and intraparenchymal arterioles [23].
Pennings et al., were the first to report direct visualization
of the responses of the human cerebral microcirculation to
hyperventilation using orthogonal polarization spectral imaging
(OPS)[13]. They observed and quantified alterations in
microvascular diameters, and found that arterioles responded
to hyperventilation by contraction, whereas larger vessels
were unaffected. SAH was associated with increased contractility
of arterioles in patients undergoing early aneurysm surgery
, as indicated by enhanced vasoconstriction in response to
hyperventilation [14]. Microcirculatory dysfunction related to
endothelial damage, microvascular thrombosis, and loss of
auto-regulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
delayed cerebral ischemia [16, 19].

Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of vasomotor tone that may
impact CV development after SAH. Endothelium-derived NO
(eNO) inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion, smooth
muscle proliferation, endothelial cell apoptosis, and leukocyte
adhesion to the endothelium. Decreased bioavailability of
endogenous NO has, thus, been widely accepted as an important
part of the pathogenesis of delayed CVS after SAH in
humans. [2, 15, 21].
Neuschmelting et al., reported that locally reduced NO
availability in basilar arterial plasma is associated with CVS
after SAH in acute animal experiment [11]. Sabri et al., used a
mouse model of SAH and the results suggest that CVS is
associated with activation of eNOS in the brain tissue. This is
accompanied by increased O
2
− and ONOO− but decreased
NO, suggesting that there is eNOS uncoupling, which theoretically
could contribute to secondary complications of SAH
such as vasospasm and microthromboembolism and eventually
, neuronal cell death[17]. Pluta et al., reported that the
subarachnoid blood scavenges NO and stimulates production
of endogenous inhibitors of eNOS, leading to decreased NO
and transient vasoconstriction after SAH [14].
The aim of our study was to assess changes in hemodynamic
parameters in different regions of the brain after SAH,
and to examine the relationship between hemodynamic parameters
and the level of NO using a rabbit as an animal SAH
model.
Materials and methods
Induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage
The ethics Subcommittee for Animal Care of the China
Medical University approved the use of animals and all procedures
followed their guidelines . A total of eighty-five adult
New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–3.5 kg) of either sex
weighing 2.5–3.5 kg were randomly assigned to two experimental
groups, SAH group (n =51), control group (n =34)
randomly. Eighty-five New Zealand white rabbits were initially
anesthetized with 3 %–5 % isoflurane. Intravenous
ketamine (3 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) were given to
maintain anesthesia during intubation [22], SAH was induced
in 51 rabbits and 34 rabbits were sham operated as controls.
Thirty-two rabbits in each group survived the second operation
and were randomly assigned to four groups of eight
rabbits each for follow-up assessments on days 1, 4, 7, or
14, respectively. The SAH group was subjected to percutaneous
puncture into the cisterna magna. There was 1.5 mL/kg of
blood withdrawn from the central ear artery and then was
injected back into the cisterna magna (3–5 minutes). The
animals were placed in a positioning device in the prone
position with the head secured at a downward angle of 30°
to facilitate the formation of a blood clot around the basilar
artery. After 48 hours, the identical operative procedure was
repeated to induce SAH. In sham operated rabbits, 1.5 mL/kg
of PBS solution was injected into the cistern magna instead
of autologous blood. After 48 hours, the same procedure
was done, but the volume of PBS solution was reduced to
1.0 mL/kg. All of the animals were awake within two hours
after the operations [22, 25], similar to the results reported
by the others.
Neurologic assessments
The postoperative neurologic deficit of the animals was
assessed every 24 hours using the scoring system reported
by Strong et al. Posture, gait, and righting reflexes were each
given a score: 0=normal; 1=mild; 2=moderate; and 3=severely
impaired. Front and back reflexes were also scored:
0=normal; 1=brisk; 2=spreading; and 3=clonus. The sum of
the individual observations provided the overall neurologic
score. One individual, blinded to the study design, completed
all neurologic assessments [20].
CT perfusion
The whole brain perfusion method was used to study the
hemodynamic parameters. The rabbits were anesthetized
using intravenous pentobarbital (3 %, 30 mg/kg) injected
through the auricular vein. The animals were placed in a prone
position on a custom designed and custom built device with
their heads secured stationary and parallel to the CTcouch. To
correct the position, a non-contrast CT head scan was performed
before perfusion (80 kV, 100 mA, matrix 512×512,
slice thickness 5 mm). For perfusion imaging, the length of the
scan was 80 mm, and consisted of 16 5-mm sections. The
contrast material (Omnipaque, 300 mg/mL; 1.5 mL/kg, ) was
injected at a rate of 1 mL/s through the auricular vein with an
automatic injector (Urich). Three hundred and twenty images
were collected at each of the 16 section locations while the
couch remained stationary. Scanning took 32 s to complete.
The images were acquired at 0.5-s intervals and 100 kVp and
80 mA, 512×512 image matrix, 120-mm FOV, and 1.0 s per
rotation [5, 20, 25].
Analysis of CBF, CBVand MTT
Functional maps were calculated using CT perfusion software
(Philips, ICT 256). Arterial concentration curves were obtained
from a 2×2 pixel region of interest (ROI) in the internal
carotid artery in the section that showed the earliest arrival of
contrast. We placed a 2×2 pixel ROI in the internal carotid
artery on the section that showed the greatest area under the
curve. The superior sagittal sinus was selected as the venous

outflow function. Six ROIs were located symmetrically in
the frontal, parietal–occipital, and temporal lobes in a bandlike
cortical of the maps. In order to verify the reliability
and mean values of the result, we hand-drew two or three
cines in every ROI and calculated the evaluation value.
Thresholds were applied to limit the effects of large blood
vessels on the tissue measurements (CBV>8.0 mL/100 g;
CBF>250 mL/100 g per minute) [8].
Histology
After CT perfusion, animals were deeply anesthetized using
intravenous ketamine (3 mg/kg), 150 mL PBS solution, and
500 mL 10 % formalin injected via the left ventricle over
30 minutes. Brain tissues located symmetrically in the frontal,
parietal–occipital, and temporal lobes were collected and
stored in 10 % buffered formalin [5, 12].
To confirm the presence and location of neuronal damage
after SAH, we performed perfusion-fixation of the brain at
24 hours. Using a rabbit brain matrix, we cut 4×2 mm sections.
Sections were paraffin-processed and microtomesectioned
into 4-μm thick sections before being stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) to identify neuronal necrosis and
apoptosis.
Nitric oxide content
We analyzed plasma NO using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA, CUSABIO USA, Rabbit NO ELISA
Kit). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.156 nmol/mL. All
the assays were carried out in duplicate. The ELISA 96-
well microtiter plates were analyzed using a microplate
photometer with the maximum absorbance at 450 nm. Before
the contrast CT scan, about 2 mL of arterial blood was
withdrawn from the central artery of the ear with a sterile
syringe. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for
15 minutes to collect about 1 mL of plasma, and stored
at−80°Cuntil analysis.
Statistical analysis
SPSS statistical software version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for analysis. Statistical significance between
two means and multiple means was determined by parametric
one-way ANOVA and T-testing. Multiple linear regression
analysis was used to identify which CT perfusion parameters
(CBF, CBV, or MTT) were significantly correlated with NO.
Statistical significance was considered if the P-value was less
than 0.05 (P <0.05).
Results
Mortality
Total mortality in the SAH and control groups was 37.3 % and
5.9 %, respectively, after the second operation until they were
sacrificed. All of the rabbits survived during the 48 hours after
the first operation. Mortality in every group after the second
operation is shown in Fig.1. In the SAH group, the surviving
rabbits’ clinical status worsened after the second operation,
and, as time went by, mortality increased. In the control group,
although the rabbits’ clinical status was not serious, the operation
also affected survival, Mortality was 11.1 % in both the
7-day and 14-day groups.
Neurologic assessments
There was no statistically significant difference in neurologic
scores among the four control groups at various time points
(P >0.05). Neurologic scores in the SAH groups were significantly
greater than those in the control groups on days 1, 4, 7,
and 14 (P <0.01) (Fig2). In the SAH group, the Day 14 score
was significantly lower than the Day 1 and Day 4 scores,
indicating that the neurological condition was improved in
surviving animals 14 days after SAH (P <0.05).
Histology
Histological analysis was performed on all brain tissue collected
to evaluate the pathological changes in the different
groups. Eosinophilic neurons and an acute inflammatory infiltrate
were found on H&E staining in the parietal-occipital
and temporal lobes of brain (Fig 3A) after SAH in all four
groups, indicating damage of brain tissue. Astrocytes and
scattered macrophages were evident in the parietal-occipital

and temporal lobes at 14 days after SAH (Fig 3B), but were
not found in the other SAH groups. There was no evidence of
damage in the control group (Fig 3C &D)andthefrontal
lobes of the SAH group.
CT perfusion
Between day 1 and 14 after SAH, CBV decreased slightly in
the cortical tissue of the brain compared with the control
groups, but this difference was not significant (P >0.05). The
location of the six symmetrical ROIs in frontal, parietaloccipital
, and temporal lobes and the two or three hand drawn
cine in each one are shown in Fig 4A.Comparedwiththe
control groups, CBF was decreased significantly after SAH
(P <0.01). MTT at the six ROIs increased significantly in
SAH groups compared with the control groups (P<0.01)
(Fig 4B).
Changes in nitric oxide levels following SAH
On average, the level of NO in the SAH group was significantly
lower than in controls at the same time-point (P <0.01,
Fig 5). Within the control group, levels of NO did not differ
significantly. In the SAH group, the NO level at day 14 was
significantly different from the day 1、4and7level,indicating
that the mechanism of NO production was functional in
surviving animals 14 days after SAH (P <0.05).
Correlation of NO with CT perfusion
In order to determine if an increase in MTT in the parietal–
occipital lobes was correlated with a reduced level of NO in
the SAH groups, a correlation analysis was performed, we
made a analysis about the correlation between NO level of
each rabbit and CTP parameters that were collected at dead
time point. We found that SAH caused acute decreases in NO
in the parietal-occipital lobes, and that an increase in MTTwas
significantly correlated with the decrease in NO following
SAH (P <.05, Fig 6). In the other lobes, the change in MTT
also was significantly correlated with the level of NO
(P<.05).
Discussion
Vasospasm is a common complication that follows SAH, and
leads to delayed ischemic neurological deficits in 20-30 % of
those affected. According to Frontera et al., “DCI is a more
clinically meaningful definition than either symptomatic deterioration
alone or the presence of arterial spasm by angiography

or TCD ” [4]. A few reports have suggested disturbances of
microcirculation after SAH aside from known infarct patterns
of delayed CVS. Using orthogonal polarization imaging (OPS),
Pennings et al., found that microvascular tonus was increased in
patients undergoing aneurysm surgery within 48 hours after
bleeding [13]. In a study using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), Weidauer et al., found focal laminar cortical infarcts
after SAH [23]. Others have found a significant correlation
between MTT values and neurovascular findings. Wintermark
et al., reported that MTT was significantly more sensitive, and
CBF and CBV were significantly more specific [24]. Kanazawa
et al., found that patients with significant vasospasm had longer
MTT compared with patients in whom vasospasm was negligible
or absent [7]. Kunze et al., found that repeatedly obaining
PCT is a valuable screening tool to detect vasospasm and to

decide whether a patient should be forwarded to angiography
[9]. Sanellia et al., in their results support the need for
prospective clinical research focused on developing CTP as a
prognostic tool for DCI and poor outcomes, which may provide
valuable information in the management and treatment of
aneurysmal SAH [18].
Multiple mechanisms might be involved in the maintenance
and reversal of microcirculation in brain tissue after
SAH. Alteration of the NO/NOS pathway is one of the molecular
mechanisms that participate in brain injury after SAH.
Other molecular mechanisms include endothelin-1 (ET-1)
release, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death pathways,
and platelet activation and aggregation.
As a mediator of vasomotor tone, NO may impact CVS
development after SAH [2]. Endothelium-derived NO inhibits
platelet aggregation and adhesion, smooth muscle proliferation
, endothelial cell apoptosis, and leukocyte adhesion to the
endothelium. Decreased bioavailability of endogenous NO
has been widely accepted as an important factor in the
pathogenesis of delayed CVS after SAH [11, 17, 21]. Pluta
et al., reported that the subarachnoid blood scavenges NO
and stimulates production of endogenous inhibitors of eNOS,
leading to decreased NO and transient vasoconstriction after
SAH [14].
Alexander et al., found that the endothelial NO synthase
(eNOS) gene may play a role in the outcome following SAH.
Decreased production of this gene leads to decrease NO
formation and an environment favoring the development of
CVS [2]. In another study, wild-type mice were subjected to
hypoxic preconditioning or normoxia followed 24 hours later
by SAH. Hypoxic preconditioning prevented reductions in
NO after SAH and increased NO levels in both shamoperated
and SAH-operated mice [21]. Five days after SAH
induction in a one-hemorrhage rabbit model, other investigators
found that local NO metabolites were lacking in basilar
arterial plasma, and this was associated with CVS after SAH
[11]. In the current investigation, the levels of NO in plasma
were decreased after and consistent with the findings of
others. We were surprised to find that NO tended to increase
over time in the 14-Day group, and was significantly different
compared with the 4-Day and 7-Day groups. We hypothesize
that regulation of NO-generated mechanisms plays a role on
pathophysiology change of brain after SAH.
Jeon H et al., has described methods to create SAH in
animal models [6]. We found that the rabbit was easy to
manipulate and operate. Zhou ML et al., pointed out that the
two-hemorrhage model is more appropriate than the onehemorrhage
model for inducing SAH or cerebral vasospasm
in rabbits since it produces more severe vasospasm with a low
mortality and a time course of vasospasm similar to that in
humans. Therefore, the two-hemorrhage model in rabbits has
been widely accepted in the field for the investigation of the
mechanisms of and therapeutic approaches for cerebral
vasospasm [25]. This, the rabbit double subarachnoid hemorrhage
model is well documented, and shows a biphasic pattern
of early and delayed vasospasm similar to that found in
humans [8]. In our experiment, the rabbits were allowed to
breathe spontaneously and were kept in the head-down position.
The mortality rates in our study corresponded with the
results of other clinical and experimental studies.
On the other hand, there are some limitations of this study.
The reasons of the death of rabbits remains unclear. We failed
to observe the change of CTP and NO level in the same group
at various time points. Leenders et al., has pointed out that that
CTP parameters varied in a large range due to individual
differences[10]. Further studies are needed to clarify the specific
mechanism of action and prove the efficacy of NO
following SAH.
Conclusion
We found that MTTwas the only CT perfusion parameter that
was significantly negatively correlated with the level of NO in
plasma at equivalent time points in the cortical brain after
SAH. Increased MTT and decreased CBF changed significantly
after SAH compared with the sham-operated group at
the same time points. These findings indicate the timedependent
activation of pathological mechanisms that participate
in brain injury after SAH, and lend support to the use of
NO treatments after SAH to reduce the risk of poor outcomes.
However, further studies are needed to prove the efficacy of
NO following SAH.
