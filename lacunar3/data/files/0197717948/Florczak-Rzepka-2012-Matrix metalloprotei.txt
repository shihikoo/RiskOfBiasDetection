on MMP expression in adult patients with spontaneous 
ICH, as well as its relation to radiological and clinical features

were considered. MMP inhibition was reviewed on the 
basis of 11 relevant experimental studies. Also, some relevant

studies provide convincing evidence of a detrimental role of 
MMPs in ICH, stressing their association with neuroinflammation.

critical for hematoma and brain edema growth as well as for 
neuronal death, which are understood as secondary brain 
injury and may have a considerable clinical impact. Although 
data on human spontaneous ICH are scarce and mostly 
based on small populations, they reveal the apparent correlation
between MMPs and clinical and radiological ICH features
as well as the functional outcome, which might rationalize
future therapeutic strategies. However, attempts at

 Abstract 
Background:  In default of a plausible and satisfactory causal
treatment for hemorrhagic stroke, a role of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular
diseases has recently been widely discussed. The wellknown
impact of MMPs on extracellular matrix destruction 
triggered by inflammation as a foundation for several diseases
, including stroke, is very much in evidence. Newly, 
some additional aspects of MMP function considering their 
intracellular activity crucial for neuronal death following 
ischemic brain damage have emerged. The effect of bloodbrain
barrier disruption caused by MMPs on the prognosis in 
patients suffering from spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) has been of interest since it throws a new light 
upon the pathogenesis, course and possible therapeutic approaches
for this least treatable and at the same time most 
life-threatening form of stroke. Hence, we primarily aimed to 
review the current clinical knowledge on the significance of 
metalloproteinase activation in the course of spontaneous 
intracranial hemorrhage in humans. We also provide a brief

 Introduction: New Challenges in the Pathogenesis 
of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage 
 Cerebrovascular research, as yet sparingly focused on 
hemorrhagic stroke, unlike the case of ischemic insults, 
has not established any milestones in the therapy of this 
severe condition. Furthermore, it seems to prove the 
unique and very complex nature of this type of stroke. 
This section is intended to provide a brief summary regarding
recent interest in the course of spontaneous intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH).
  Spontaneous ICH accounts for about 15% of all stroke 
cases, and up to 50% of patients with this condition die 
within 1 month after onset  [1] . Age, intraventricular 
bleeding extension, baseline hematoma size and Glasgow 
Coma Scale score but first and foremost hematoma 
growth within the first 24 h as crucial for the prognosis 
in spontaneous ICH patients were recently intensively 
studied with the hope of achieving a better understanding
of the pathogenesis of spontaneous ICH  [2, 3] .  The 
Factor Seven for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Trial failed 
to confirm clinical benefit of applying recombinant factor
VIIa as early treatment of spontaneous ICH  [4] .  Although
significant hematoma growth reduction was 
shown after recombinant factor VIIa administration, it 
has been pointed out that inadequate patient selection 
could have counterbalanced the primarily promising effects
 [5, 6] .
  Nevertheless, bleeding growth remains an important 
target when considering new therapeutic approaches.
  When discussing the phenomenon of bleeding formation
and enlargement after ICH, the significance of perihematomal
edema (PHE) needs to be raised. Xi et al.  [7]
hypothesized edema formation to be vital in secondary 
brain injury after spontaneous ICH onset, contributing 
to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and hematoma enlargement.
PHE formation was shown to start as soon as 
3 h after spontaneous ICH onset and to increase even up 
to 14 days  [8, 9] . Gebel et al.  [10]  proved relative PHE 
(PHE volume divided by hematoma volume measured on 
baseline brain CT scans) to be an independent predictor 
of poor neurological outcome but not mortality 3 months 
after spontaneous ICH onset. However, the pivotal role in 
edema formation has been assigned to the thrombolytic 
cascade and production of thrombin within 24 h. It is 
worth noting that expression of prothrombin mRNA additionally
by neurons, without opening of the BBB, can 
amplify that effect by directly promoting the development
of edema and enhancing inflammation  [11] .  Thrombin
may also induce brain edema development by influencing
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Michel-Monigadon
et al.  [11]  showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
inhibition reduced brain edema after experimental brain 
hemorrhage.
  Thus, the origin of primary PHE after spontaneous 
ICH is vasogenic and not cytotoxic, as it develops due to 
an increase in the permeability of the BBB after the onset 
of ICH and is triggered by proinflammatory agents  [7] .
  Matrix Metalloproteinases: Profile and Properties 
 Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) together with other
proteases such as serine or cysteine proteases belong to 
the group of endopeptidases. They play a unique role in 
remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) due to their 
ability to splinter its integrity. This makes them important 
contributors in many physiological processes including 
blastocyst implantation, embryonic development, nerve 
growth, endometrial cycling, mammary gland morphogenesis
, bone remodeling, wound healing, angiogenesis 
and apoptosis. Also of the utmost importance is their participation
in a number of pathologic processes; MMPs are 
ubiquitously employed, for example, in cancer invasion 
and metastasis. Moreover, they are assumed to induce tissue
destruction in, for example, aortic aneurysm, rheumatoid
arthritis, gastric ulcer, dilated cardiomyopathy 
and fibrotic lung disease as well as in many diseases of the 
central nervous system  [12–14] . They also promote anoikis
– cell death due to homelessness – as a result of matrix 
disintegration  [14] . Intracellular MMP function has been 
widely studied, providing new insight into the role of this 
enzyme family. MMPs have been shown to invade cells in 
the process of endocytosis and to take part in protein 
cleavage in the cytosol and in some of the organelles  [15] . 
More importantly, as reviewed by Mannello and Medda 
[16]   , some MMPs can enter the cellular nucleus and influence
gene transcription and DNA repair, leading to decreased
function of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 
(PARP-1) and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein-1
, which are responsible for the process of DNA reparation.
This in turn results in apoptosis.

 MMPs in Human Spontaneous ICH Cerebrovasc Dis 2012;34:249–262 251
ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs are also known as 
metizins because of the specific structure of their catalytic
domain containing a zinc atom  [13] .
  In fact, there are three functional domains that form 
the MMPs structure and which determine the idiosyncrasy
of the MMPs, merging these 24 enzymes into one 
superfamily of zinc peptidases. The basic constellation 
comprising a signaling peptide (predomain), propeptide 
(prodomain) and catalytic domain is identical to the 
smallest MMP, called matrilysin (MMP-1). With the 
broadening of knowledge regarding MMPs, the terminology
used to name these enzymes has been changing. 
Nevertheless, the system based on substrate specificity is 
still widely used. It comprises 8 subgroups named after 
their substrates: matrilysins, collagenases, stromelysins, 
gelatinases, convertase-activatable MMPs, membraneassociated
MMPs, MMP-23A and MMP-23B ( fig. 1 ). Altogether
, MMPs are responsible for entire ECM remodeling
 [13] .
  Under normal quiescent conditions, MMPs expression
is very limited and MMPs are detected either in 
small amounts or not at all in tissues or in the circulation.
  Usually MMPs are synthetized as nonactive, latent 
forms called zymogens. Their latency is maintained by

subgroups of MMPs, which are all based on the minimal domain set. The hemopexin domain differs 
slightly among the subgroups, thus determining the substrate specificity. Additional inserts and domains provide
further specificity differentiations between the subgroups (graphic by M. Florczak-Rzepka and A. 
Sułkowska).

main and the SH group of unpaired cysteine in the highly
conserved sequence in the prodomain ( fig. 2 )  [17] .
  Importantly, the activation of MMPs is regulated on 3 
main levels, starting with transcription, through activation
of latent forms and ending up at the inhibition level
 [14] . The next three sections are devoted to these processes.
  MMP  Activation 
 Following signal peptide removal in the process of 
translation, usually inactive MMPs are secreted into the 
extracellular space to be activated there ( fig. 3 ). However, 
recent studies on intracellular MMP activity provide evidence
that the MMP activatory process may also take  
place inside the cell  [15, 16] .
  Crucial for enzymatic activation of MMPs is cleavage 
of the cysteine-zinc bridge (6- to 10-kDa N-terminal propeptide
cleavage) in the process called ‘cysteine switch’. 
This leads to exposure of the zinc atom to water molecules
and the thiol group to a substrate  [17] .  Afterwards, 
the prodomain is cleaved in a process called autocatalysis. 
Thus, the latent MMP form – proform or zymogen – becomes
an active, lower-molecular weight MMP. There are 
at least 3 mechanisms by which the Cys-Zn coordination 
is broken, as reviewed by Cauwe and Opde nakker  [15] . 
The main MMP activatory pathways are schematically 
depicted in  figures 2  and  3  and described below:
  (1) The first of these is proteolytic cleavage, which 
depends on catalytic site opening by proteases. The special
role of serine proteases in this process may be explained
by their involvement in many intra- and extracellular
processes, such as the coagulation cascade. Plasmin
, which belongs to the serine protease family, 
localizes in the vicinity of fibrin deposition or on mobilized
cells, which allows it to take part in diverse processes
such as fibrinolysis and ECM decomposition during
cell migration. This specific localization is guaranteed
by the proenzyme form, plasminogen, but firstly by 
the close proximity to plasminogen activator, which in 
turn depends on the type of plasminogen activator; tissue
plasminogen activator anchors fibrin, whereas urokinase
plasminogen activator sticks to membrane receptors
 [18] .
Fig. 2.  Autocatalysis in the process of 
MMPs activation. Prodomain cleavage 
may occur either extracellularly or inside 
cells as a result of several processes. The 
best known is direct proteolysis mediated 
by serine proteases or other active MMPs. 
Free oxygen or nitrogen radicals (reactive 
oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species) 
may cause disruption of the Cys-Zn interaction.
Allosteric activation causes distortion
of the catalytic site in MMPs. All reactions
are followed by prodomain cleavage, 
which definitely leads to MMP activation. 
All depicted pathways occur extracellularly.
Proteolysis and activation by reactive 
oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species 
can also occur inside cells. More details on 
MMP activation are to be found in the text 
(graphic by M. Florczak-Rzepka and A. 
Sułkowska).

 MMPs in Human Spontaneous ICH Cerebrovasc Dis 2012;34:249–262 253
  Intracellular proteolytic activation depends on furin, 
one of the serine peptidases that was found to cleave some 
MMPs, like MMP-11 and membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP 
in the trans-Golgi apparatus network  [19, 20] .
  The link between serine proteinases and MMP activation
builds up a complicated system of interactions and 
was therefore named the ‘protease web’ or ‘internet’, 
whereby active MMPs activate other MMPs  [21] .
  An example of such a relationship is the MMP-2 activatory
pathway, which is promoted by active MT1-MMP. 
This also applies to gelatinase B (MMP-9) and MMP-13. 
Interestingly, in the process of MMP-2 liberation, binding
to tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 is required  [12, 
14, 22]  ( fig. 3 ).
  (2) Any cell injury may lead to an imbalance between 
the production and disposal of reactive oxygen species or 
reactive nitrogen species, causing oxidative or nitrosative
stress, respectively. Oxygen or nitrogen free radicals 
may interact with the thiol group in the prodomain and 
expose catalytic zinc to bind with water molecules and 
so activate the MMP. An interesting fact is that a low 
concentration of some free radicals may activate some 
zymogens, such as pro-MMP-7  [23] , but at the same 
time, prolonged exposure to free radicals and their persistent
high concentration may, in contrast, inactivate 
some MMPs. Eventually, it was shown that in some cases
there is no ultimate need for prodomain cleavage to 
achieve an active state of MMPs in the presence of free

reticulum (ER) to the cell surface as zymogens devoid of the predomain. Most of the MMPs are secreted, 
and their activation takes place in the extracellular space. MMPs equipped with a transmembrane domain anchor
to the cell membrane and are activated on the cell surface. Pro-MMP-2 binds to the complex molecule 
consisting of an active MT-MMP (transmembrane MMP) and TIMP to form the active MMP-2 form. Further 
information is to be found in the text (graphic by M. Florczak-Rzepka and A. Sułkowska).

radicals. Therefore, the MMP proform is no more equivalent
to the latent form or zymogen. Similar modification
of the thiol group may also occur in the presence of 
nonphysiological agents, like heavy metal ions or alkylating
reagents [15].
  (3) Allosteric activation of MMPs consists of shape 
modification of the catalytic site in the MMP molecule. 
The same effect may be achieved by attaching a substrate, 
mainly nonphysiological agents, to the thiol group and 
disruption of the Cys-Zn coordination.
  All the activatory pathways take place in the extracellular
space  [15] .
  The intracellular MMP activation process, as reviewed 
by Cauwe and Opdenakker  [15] , includes proteolysis and 
oxidative/nitrosative stress but also phosphorylation mediated
by alkaline phosphatase, which was shown in the 
case of MMP-2 activation. Most frequently this process 
occurs in MMPs containing a fibronectin-like domain, 
but it has also been shown in the case of MT1-MMP in its 
cytoplasmatic domain.
  Alternatively to prodomain cleavage, it was found that 
low-molecular weight MMPs lacking signal peptide and 
propeptide may be expressed in a process called alternative
splicing, as in the case of MMP-11  [15] .
  Gene  Expression 
 A wide range of factors can induce MMPs transcription.
Some data based on cancer research indicate the role 
of growth factors, cytokines and oncogene products. Typically
they are released by the matrix or infiltrating host 
defense cells but also by tumor cells themselves. Additionally
, every change in the cell vicinity such as form alterations
of the cell or mechanical stress can also trigger 
MMPs transcription. As yet, there is no single agent that 
has been found to be exclusively responsible for activating 
MMPs gene expression  [13] . Nuclear factor (NF)-  B  and 
other nuclear factors, as well as tumor necrosis factor- 
(TNF-  ), interleukin (IL)-1   and IL-6, are also constantly
involved in the MMPs expression process  [13, 24]   ( f ig. 4 ).

 MMPs in Human Spontaneous ICH Cerebrovasc Dis 2012;34:249–262 255
By virtue of the variability in the promoter of MMP genes, 
another level of MMP diversity opens. Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms may modify the processing of mRNA and 
consequently the activity of expressed proteases. It has 
been reported that a 736-base pair region in the promoter 
sequence of the gene encoding MMP-9 containing a cytosine-adenosine
repeat may vary in length from 13 to up to 
23 repeats in the human population and is associated with 
susceptibility to intracranial aneurysms  [25] . In fact, one 
should consider that a polymorphism is merely a variation 
of the normal sequence, and hence, small-sample studies 
may not have enough power to demonstrate any phenotypic
effect of such a genetic variant.
  M M P   I n h i b i t i o n  
 Attenuation of MMPs activity is crucial to counterbalance
their proteolytic extra- and intracellular activity 
[17] . There are several ways to inhibit MMPs, firstly by 
targeting factors that may possibly induce MMPs gene 
expression and secondly by influencing MMPs activity.
In fact, there are two physiological MMP inhibitors
(MMPIs). Outside tissues, in the plasma,   2-macroglobulin
binds to MMPs, creating an irreversible complex. Inside
tissues, specific TIMPs were found to be mainly responsible
for regulation of MMPs activity  [16] .
  Inhibition is achieved through formation of tight 1:  1 
noncovalent complexes with TIMPs. Four types of these 
natural inhibitors have been described so far, and each 
one is able to interact with any of the MMPs. However, 
there is a clear proclivity towards some combinations between
MMPs and their inhibitors, such as TIMP-1-
MMP-2 and TIMP-2-MMP-9  [17] . It is also worth noticing
at this point that in the case of TIMP-2 and -3, lower 
concentrations can enhance rather than inhibit MMP-2. 
Inversely, at higher concentrations, MT1-MMP is entirely
blocked, which results in a purely inhibitory effect on 
MMP-2  [18, 26]   ( fig. 3 ).
  However, the role of TIMPs is complex and extends 
beyond a strictly inhibitory effect on MMPs, at least in 
the case of cerebral ischemia  [27, 28] .
  What Is the Link between the Function of MMPs and 
the Pathogenesis of ICH? 
 ICH is a massive event, destroying brain tissues by induction
of several mechanisms. Primary brain injury occurs
within minutes after ICH onset and is related to the 
extravasated blood mass itself but also to the cell debris 
and plasma proteins. As described by Aronowski and 
Zhao  [29] , erythrocytes are lysed within 24 h, releasing 
hemoglobin along with its derivatives, including heme 
and iron, which are both capable of evoking oxidative cell 
damage by generating free radicals. It seems that the protective
role of haptoglobin in building complexes with 
free hemoglobin, thus preventing its toxicity, is insufficient
, as its recovery process, mostly by the liver, lasts 5–7 
days. However, there is some evidence that haptoglobin 
may be produced at the site of bleeding. Nevertheless, it 
was also reported by the same group that in the course of 
ICH, endogenous antioxidative mechanisms may be depressed
, such as that mediated by Nrf2. This was confirmed
using Nrf2-knockout mice, which had much more 
extensive brain tissue injury than wild types after induced
ICH  [30] . Fortunately, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-  -induced antioxidative enzyme (catalase
) production was shown to be upregulated in experimental
ICH  [31, 32] .
  The second part of the posthemorrhagic brain injury 
occurs in parallel and starts within hours from the ictus. 
Mediated by adhesion molecules, leukocyte infiltration 
as well as activation of other immune cells (macrophages, 
microglia, astroglia) results in cytokines (e.g. IL-1  , 
TNF-  ) and chemokines overexpression. The main inflammatory
pathway signaling molecule is thought to be 
NF-  B, which affects gene transcription of the abovementioned
key adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines
as well as MMPs ( fig. 4 )  [33–36] .  Secondary 
brain injury results in disruption of the BBB, brain edema 
and massive neuronal death. The role of MMPs in both 
processes seems to be fundamental.
  In the central nervous system, the basement membrane
(BM) has a pivotal role for preserving the function 
of the BBB, which is made up of the following types of 
cells: perivascular endfeet of astrocytes, glia (microglia), 
pericytes, neuronal processes and the basal lamina (BM). 
The latter consists mainly of type IV collagen, laminin, 
fibronectin and elastin ( fig. 5 )  [14, 18, 37] .
  For a better understanding of the association between 
some MMPs and BBB breakdown, some facts need to be 
recalled. The remodeling of ECM in the whole organism 
by MMPs is guaranteed by the affinity of each group of 
MMPs to particular substrates. Interestingly, the ability 
to digest type IV collagen makes gelatinases A and B 
(MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively) unique among other 
proteases and determines their role in BBB damage. In 
this case, binding to the BM is possible due to a fibronectin-binding
region, a unique additional domain in the

structure of this specific group of MMPs ( fig. 1 )  [37] . 
Apart from this extracellular MMP function, there is also 
another, intracellular part.
  Preservation of BBB function is guaranteed by tight 
junction (TJ) protein complexes within the endothelium 
( fig. 5 ). A TJ is a type of connection between two endothelial
cells which limits transfer of substances and water 
through the BBB. The intercellular part of the TJ consists 
of claudins and occludins, which are attached to the intracellular
scaffold made up of zona occludens proteins 
(1, 2, 3) and cingulin anchored in the cytoskeleton. As 
described by Cauwe and Opdenakker  [15] , MMPs were 
shown to attack zona occludens-1, causing its cleavage 
and TJ disruption.
  Moreover, as already mentioned, MMPs may directly 
contribute to cellular death either by anoikis or by their 
intranuclear function. It was found that furin may activate
MMPs inside cell nuclei and active enzymes are able 
to cleave PARP and PARP-activated X-ray repair crosscomplementing
protein-1 – both molecules take part in 
the DNA reparation process following oxidative stress 
damage  [15] .
  Macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) has been found 
to be highly overexpressed in the area around hematoma. 
It was also demonstrated to be a key molecule that correlates
with outcome in experimental ICH. Nevertheless, 
MMP-12 has been widely neglected in recent inquires and 
not yet considered in clinical investigations  [38] .
  Interestingly, Mun-Bryce et al.  [39]  used somatic 
evoked potentials in hemorrhagic stroke to show the depressed
cortical response, also contralateral to the hematoma
site, which was followed by overexpression of MMP-
9 and MMP-2 (gelatinases), implying that neuroinflammation
triggered by blood extravasation in the course of 
ICH is not limited to the directly damaged brain tissue. 
This may suggest that the inflammation in the course of 
ICH is not only localized to the lesion but also involves 
distant areas.

  Moreover, it has been postulated that the inflammatory
cascade in hemorrhagic brain extends beyond it 
and is reflected in increased concentrations of inflammatory
biomarkers in the peripheral blood. This is 
probably due to increased expression of cytokines such 
as TNF-  ,  IL-1   and specifically IL-6, which triggers 
production of acute-phase proteins in the liver such as 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, thus amplifying
inflammation ( fig. 3 )  [40] .
  Summing up, MMPs play a crucial role in secondary 
brain injury following neuroinflammation, leading to 
opening of the BBB, apoptosis and both vasogenic and 
cytotoxic brain edema following ICH.
  MMPs and Human Spontaneous ICH 
 Rosenberg   [41]  was one of the first to describe the 
causative connection between MMPs and stroke in rodents.
Power et al.  [38]  described the activation profile 
and pathogenic aspects of MMP-2, -3, -7, -9 and -12 in the 
course of experimental ICH ( table 1 ).
  Clinically, MMPs have been associated with ischemic 
and hemorrhagic stroke. The MMP-9 concentration was 
found to predict hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral
ischemia. The ability of MMP-9 to cleave the components
of the BBB was proposed as a possible explanation 
for this correlation  [42] .
  To the best of our knowledge, Abilleira et al.  [43]   were 
the first to describe overexpression of MMP-9 in human 
spontaneous ICH. They established the standard values 
for the plasma concentration of MMP-9 and other related 
biomarkers in healthy controls. Subsequently, they 
showed a direct correlation between MMP-9 plasma level
, neutrophil count and relative perifocal edema (relative 
PHE = PHE/baseline spontaneous ICH) in deep hematomas
, as well as neurological worsening measured by 
means of the Canadian Stroke Scale, all measured within 
24 h after spontaneous ICH onset. This provides an important
indication as to the significance of the BBB disruption
of inflammatory origin in the course of spontaneous
ICH. However, unlike in the case of deep hemorrhage
, no significant relationship between the MMP-9 
concentration and the course of lobar bleeding was found, 
probably due to the small sample size.
  Early growth of the intracerebral bleeding in spontaneous
ICH patients 48 h after onset was also proved to be 
associated with higher levels of MMP-9 and such molecular
factors as TNF-  , IL-6 and fibronectin, as well as
the common inflammatory markers leukocytes, platelets 
and fibrinogen  [44] .
  Importantly, MMP-9 and MMP-2 were also detected 
in the perihematomal area in humans within 6 h after 
death, and their concentration was higher in the affected 
than in the contralateral hemisphere  [36, 45] . Wu et al. 
[46]  confirmed the upregulation of MMP-9 in spontaneous
ICH up to 5 days after hemorrhage onset. Additionally
, NF-  B, p65 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2
were overexpressed, showing predominance at the 
hematoma site.
  Another group carried out a prospective controlled 
study in 60 patients with spontaneous ICH who underwent
hematoma evacuation  [47] . The MMP-9 level was 
determined on days 1, 4 and 7 after neurosurgery in blood 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The MMP-9 level was 
higher in patients when compared with healthy controls

in both blood and CSF. Interestingly, there was no MMP-
9 found in normal CSF. Subsequently, these findings correlated
positively with ICH and PHE volume as well as 
with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 
in the studied group of patients.
  Moreover, there is a certain pattern of release of MMP-
2, -3 and -9 after spontaneous ICH and thus also their 
inhibitors TIMP-1 and -2. The blood concentration of 
some of these molecules measured at different time points 
correlated with PHE volume and mortality within 3 
months after spontaneous ICH onset  [48] . Castellazzi et 
al.  [49]  found increasing MMP-9 serum levels in spontaneous
ICH patients within a week from admission. At the 
same time, MMP-2 decreased continuously. Nevertheless
, MMP levels correlated with PHE volume, which in 
turn increased during the observational period  [9] . 
Hence, MMPs are likely to be involved in PHE formation 
and may have an impact on patients’ outcome. Thus, the 
time profile of MMP expression may be pivotal when 
thinking about future therapeutic aspects.
  Yamani et al.  [50]  showed a relation between spontaneous
ICH, enhanced MMP expression and subsequent development
of coronary vasculopathy in patients who underwent
heart transplant from spontaneous ICH donors. 
Increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression was 
found in the donors’ leukocytes and then in heart biopsies 
of the recipients 1 week after the surgical procedure. The 
MMP levels as well as the occurrence of coronary vasculopathy
and myocardial fibrosis were significantly higher 
in patients whose donors died of ICH than in patients 
whose donors died due to trauma. These results provide 
further evidence supporting the important role of neuroinflammation
after spontaneous ICH as a generalized 
process which may influence the outcome after ICH not 
only resulting from the secondary brain injury.
  Wu et al.  [46]  investigated the timing of secondary 
brain damage in patients with spontaneous ICH who underwent
hematoma evacuation. Apart from increased 
levels of MMP-9, they observed overexpression of caspase-3
and proliferation of terminal uridine nick-end labeling-positive
cells as early as 6 h after spontaneous ICH 
onset with the tendency to progression up to 24 h, limited 
by the duration of the observation. This was accompanied
by aggravated cell death and PHE, suggesting that 
secondary brain tissues damage occurs in the first few 
hours, at least up to 24 h after intracerebral bleeding onset
and is primarily enhanced by apoptosis. Thus, the authors
raised again the controversial problem of the relevance
of early hematoma evacuation to improve patient 
outcome.
  Spontaneous ICH is mainly associated with arterial 
hypertension. In a recent population study, arterial hypertension
was found in 72.9% of patients with lobar ICH 
compared with 83.3% of cases presenting deep hemorrhages
 [1] . However, often in elderly spontaneous ICH patients
with no history of arterial hypertension, cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the most likely cause of the 
bleeding. Interestingly, it was found that amyloid, which 
leads to cerebral vessel pathology in CAA, is mainly composed
of   -amyloid (the same as in Alzheimer’s disease) 
and can independently induce MMP-9, thus increasing 
the risk of spontaneous ICH in the elderly  [51] .  Hernandez-Guillamon
et al. [52] studied MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
in patients with CAA-related hemorrhagic stroke 
and in healthy controls. Although there was no difference 
in MMP plasma levels between ICH patients and controls, 
MMPs were upregulated in the perihe matomal area of 
brains in hemorrhagic patients when compared to the 
contralateral site of these brains and nonhemorrhagic 
brains. The authors also showed increased MMP-2 expression
in   -amyloid-damaged vessels, whereas MMP-9 
was found in inflammatory cells.
  An important role of MMPs was also shown in the case 
of moyamoya disease. Fujimura et al. [53] found increased 
MMP-9 serum levels in patients diagnosed with this condition
compared to norma l MMP-9 levels found in hea lt hy 
controls. This finding was not true for MMP-2, which remained
at the same level in both groups. The authors concluded
that this may facilitate pathological vascular processes
and thus cause brain hemorrhages.
  Finally, a deleterious role of MMPs was described
by many authors in the case of subarachnoid bleeding 
(subarachnoid hemorrhage, SAH). Since SAH is mainly 
caused by aneurysm rupture, it is not considered spontaneous
ICH and thus formally exceeds the scope of this 
review. Nevertheless, some most recent facts regarding 
the involvement of MMPs seem worth remarking upon. 
Frösen et al. [54] pointed out the role of inflammation 
and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of intracranial 
aneurysm formation as the main cause of mural cell degeneration
and impairment of endothelial cell function. 
Interestingly, the International Study of Unruptured 
Aneurysms group recently published a report on a possible
protective effect of aspirin in unruptured aneurysms.
In a group of 271 patients, they showed a trend 
toward a lower risk of hemorrhage due to aneurysm rupture
in patients under continuous aspirin therapy (3 
times weekly to daily) [55] . This supports a role of inflammation
in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid bleeding.
Chau et al. [56] studied CSF and blood concentra-

tions of MMP-9 and white blood cell (WBC) counts in 
35 SAH patients over 14 days. It was found that WBC 
and neutrophil count elevation over 2 weeks from SAH 
onset were independently associated with vasospasm. 
Also, WBC count and MMP-9 levels in the blood as well 
as CSF were related to poor clinical outcome (modified 
Rankin Scale score  1 2) within 3 months. They also 
found an association between WBC count and MMP-9 
levels in the blood as well as between blood and CSF 
MMP-9 concentrations. This in turn supports the role 
of leukocyte recruitment but also MMP-9 activation as 
crucial for the neuroinflammatory cascade. Another 
group found a significant relationship between SAH severity
as assessed by means of the World Federation of 
Neurosurgical Societies scale and pro-MMP-9 concentration
in CSF. Also, the MMP-9 preform was remarkably
higher in patients who developed cerebral ischemia 
as a complication of SAH  [57] .
  Summing up, the role of MMPs in spontaneous ICH is 
evident. The early phase of the disease is characterized by 
a rapidly progressing inflammatory cascade, which leads 
to disruption of the BBB and spreads beyond the hematoma.
The enlargement of bleeding along with the formation 
of brain edema determines the extent of the secondary 
brain damage ( table 1 ). Moreover, it seems that the effect 
of the MMP-mediated response in the course of ICH may 
vary according to the MMP type. Prior studies imply that 
MMP-9 is involved in the acute phase, whereas MMP-2 
acts more in the chronic phase, which is compatible with 
results of basic science studies. Moreover, neuroinflammation
and thus MMPs play an important role in the pathogenesis
of subarachnoid bleeding and its complications.
  These data are supported by findings derived from animal
models of spontaneous ICH highlighting the local 
origin of the inflammatory cascade, which disperses afterwards.
In all experimental studies presented in  table 1 , 
either collagenase-induced ICH models or models with 
autologous blood injection into rodent brains were used.
  MMPs as Targets for Therapy 
 Given the unquestionable role of MMPs and foremost 
the gelatinases in the pathology of spontaneous ICH, 
their inhibition becomes an interesting issue regarding 
therapy of spontaneous ICH. So far, MMPs attenuation 
has been studied in a few experimental models of spontaneous
ICH ( table 2 ). Interestingly, most of the inhibitors 
tested are derived from cancer research and were proved 
to act as possible antimetastatic agents. However, they are

mostly unspecific, which may explain their broad spectrum
of function including some inevitable side effects 
mainly related to long-term suppression of the essential 
physiologic processes mediated by MMPs but also to inhibition
of ADAMs and ADAMs with thrombospondin 
motifs  [21] . The most important MMPIs along with their 
brief profile in relation to ICH are listed in  table 2 .
  Wang et al.  [58]  tested GM6001, a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase
inhibitor administered intraperitoneally 
(100 mg/kg) in mice every 24 h for 2 days starting
2 h after ICH induction. They managed to demonstrate a 
significant reduction of the secondary brain damage due 
to leukocyte infiltration, MMP-9 activity and oxygen-derived
free radicals (reactive oxygen species). As a result, 
brain edema, neuronal loss and neurological deficit diminished
on day 3 after ICH onset and treatment application
, confirming the crucial role of MMP-9 in the pathology
of the early deterioration after ICH.
  Lee et al.  [59]  showed a link between MMP-9 but not 
MMP-2 overexpression in mouse brain tissues and vascular
endothelial growth factor-induced brain hemorrhage.
In this model imitating brain arteriovenous malformation-derived
hemorrhage, minocycline suppressed 
ICH evolution, including significant reduction of the 
bleeding. A slightly smaller effect on hematoma was observed
when using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, inhibitor
of NF-  B, an upstream regulator of MMPs. These 
findings confirm that MMP-9 expression due to ICH can 
be regulated through different pathways, which is even 
more challenging in terms of possible inhibitory therapy.
  Quite interesting findings derive from another experimental
study where the authors tested the following nonspecific
and specific MMPIs: BB-1101, BB-94, BB-2983, 
IW499, tetracyclines, steroids and DMSO (a selective 
MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitor). A significant reduction 
in BBB permeability was achieved when using BB-1101, 
BB-94, minocycline and 10% DMSO. Other substances, 
including GM6001 and the sole MMP-2 inhibitor IW499, 
were ineffective and did not reduce the leakage through 
the BBB  [41] .
  On the other hand, Grossetete et al.  [60]  showed BB-94 
to increase hematoma with no effect on PHE. More importantly
, it also enhanced cell death.
  Although so far not considered in the group of
MMPIs, there are some agents that may be worth noting, 
as described below.
  M e m a n t i n e ,  a n  u n c o m p e t i t i v e  N - m e t h y l -  D -aspartate 
receptor antagonist, reduced neuroinflammation, including
MMP-9 levels, and caused hematoma reduction 
by 47%  [61] .
  Sinn et al.  [62]  demonstrated valproic acid to enhance 
alleviation of the inflammatory cascade and significantly
reduce bleeding as well as attenuate cell death in the 
perihematomal area after ICH in rats. The rationale provided
refers to the ability of valproic acid to regulate gene 
expression and thus the possible alteration of the cytokine
profile involved in the pathophysiology of ICH.
  Final Considerations and Conclusions 
 Many data indicate the deleterious role of MMPs in 
the secondary brain damage following spontaneous ICH. 
At present, available clinical studies are scarce, mostly 
based on small populations and thus deliver merely a limited
insight into the topic. However, the important role of 
MMPs in human spontaneous ICH in regard to the clinical
and radiological course of the disease as well as its 
impact on functional outcome seems to be already established.
A great number of rodent ICH studies strengthen 
this thesis by delivering promising data on MMPIs and 
MMP-9 knockout mice  [45] . Still, there are some apparently
inconsistent results from other knockout experiments
suggesting that the total blockade of MMPs may 
not be unquestionably advantageous  [63, 64] .  However, 
some of these data are based on different experimental 
models of ICH, and thus conclusions should be drawn 
very carefully. Another reason for contrary findings may 
be the above-mentioned low specificity of many drugs 
tested for MMP inhibition.
  It should not be forgotten that MMPs as natural molecules
in the human body are involved in a number of 
processes, which comprise other vital functions apart 
from the inflammatory cascade  [14, 24, 27, 65] .
  Hence, when considering blocking MMPs for therapeutic
purposes, one has to be aware of their ubiquitous 
role in the human body and weigh the pros and cons carefully.
The activity of MMPs, though, as crucial for the 
recovery phase after ICH, cannot be irreversibly blocked 
but merely modulated. Therefore, more properly designed
experimental studies are needed to define the critical
point of the MMP-activating cascade before any conclusions
can be transferred to clinical trials.
