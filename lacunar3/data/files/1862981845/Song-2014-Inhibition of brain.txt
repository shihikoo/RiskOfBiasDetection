Infarct size and brain edema following ischemia/reperfusion are reduced by inhibitors of the Na+,K+,2Cl−,andwatercotransporter
NKCC1 and by��
1
-adrenoceptor antagonists. NKCC1 is a secondary active transporter, mainly localized in astrocytes, driven by
transmembrane Na+/K+gradients generated by the Na+,K+-ATPase. The astrocytic Na +,K+-ATPase is stimulated by small increases
in extracellular K+concentration and by the�� -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Larger K+increases, as occurring during ischemia,
alsostimulateNKCC1,creatingcellswelling.Thisstudyshowedno edemaafter3 hrmedialcerebralarteryocclusionbutpronounced

-adrenergic pathways, indicating failure of
K+-mediated, but not��
1
-adrenoceptor-mediated, stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 transport during reoxygenation. Ninety
percent reduction of extracellular Ca2+concentration occurs in ischemia. Ca2+omission abolished K+uptake in normoxic cultures
of astrocytes after addition of 5 mM KCl. A large decrease in ouabain potency on K+ uptake in cultured astrocytes was also
demonstrated in Ca2+-depleted media, and endogenous ouabains are needed for astrocytic K+ uptake. Thus, among the ionic
changes induced by ischemia, the decrease in extracellular Ca2+causes failure of the high-K+-stimulated Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1
ion/water uptake, making��
1
-adrenergic activation the only stimulus and its inhibition effective against edema.
1. Introduction
Cellular edema is a dreaded consequence of ischemic stroke.
On account of the fixed volume of the skull changes in cellular
and extracellular volume can compromise cerebral blood
flow and metabolism or result in compression of vital brain
structures. Novel potential treatment targets for cerebral
edema include the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter NKCC1, a
critical mediator of edema formation [1]. Its specific inhibitor,
bumetanide, inhibits ischemia-reperfusion-induced edema
in experimental stroke after middle cerebral occlusion
(MCAO) followed by reperfusion [2–4], and knock-out of
NKCC1 reduces brain swelling by one-half following 2 hr of
MCAO and 24 hr of reperfusion [5].
Dysregulation of ion homeostasis plays a major role in
the formation of brain edema. Brain slices show pronounced
swelling (edema) during exposure to highly elevated K+
concentrations [6, 7] and the swelling increases with the
extracellular K+ concentration up to∼50mM [8]. Pronounced
increases in extracellular K+concentrations rapidly
occur during brain ischemia together with a massive decrease
in extracellular Ca2+ and a more moderate decrease in
extracellular Na+ [9]. In adult brain NKCC1 is mainly
expressed in astrocytes [10–13]. They are also the cells that
show most swelling after exposure to pathologically elevated
extracellular K+concentration [14–16].
NKCC1 is not an active transporter but its operation
is driven by ion gradients established by Na+,K+-ATPase
activity, making it a secondary active transporter [18–20],
which requires ongoing or preceding Na+,K+-ATPase activity
in order to function. In turn, function of the Na+,K+-
ATPase is critically dependent upon the presence of oxygen

and a metabolic substrate, generally glucose. The astrocytic
Na+,K+-ATPase is normally stimulated by slightly elevated
extracellular K+ concentrations [21–23]. The resulting stimulation
of K+ uptake requires K+-activated signaling by
endogenous ouabains at low nM concentrations, which
includes an increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]
i
) evoked by activation of the IP 
3
receptor [17].
This leads to an uptake of Na +, which is required for 
concomitant stimulation of the intracellular Na+-sensitive
site of the astrocytic Na+,K+-ATPase and compensates for the
absence of astrocytic Na+entryduringneuronalexcitation.In
neurons the effect of low nanomolar ouabain concentrations
on[Ca2+]
i
is known to be abolished by a blocker of the Na+-
Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) [24]. The same authors also showed
ouabain-mediated Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum
in astrocytes but unfortunately no information was providedaboutpotentialeffectsofNCX.Thiswouldhavebeen
important, because inhibition of astrocytic ouabain signaling
and thus Na+,K+-ATPase function by deficient Ca2+ entry
after ischemia/reperfusion-induced depletion of extracellular
Ca2+[9] might inactivate the normally occurring K+-induced
stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity required for NKCC1
function [17]. This would make NKCC1 stimulation dependent
upon�� -adrenergic signaling, which also stimulates
astrocytic, but not neuronal, Na+,K+-ATPase activity [23].
It would mean that following ischemia/reperfusion NKCC1
activity would be selectively dependent upon�� -adrenergic
stimulation. Such dependency might explain the protective
effect of�� -adrenergic antagonists demonstrated in animal
models of CNS ischemia [25–28].
In the present study the increase in brain edema by
unilateral MCAO and its abolishment by an NKCC1 inhibitor
and a��
1
-adrenergic antagonist were confirmed. Moreover,
whether the increase occurred during the ischemic period or
was delayed until after reoxygenation and whether inhibition
of the known pathway for��
1
-adrenergic stimulation of
cultured astrocytes also prevented edema formation were
tested. The inhibitory effect of extracellular Ca 2+ deficiency
on K+ uptake was tested in two different types of experiments.
One of these compared effects of a slightly elevated
extracellular K+ concentration and of the��
1
-adrenergic
agonist dobutamine on uptake of K+ into primary cultures
of astrocytes during incubation in a medium with a normal
Ca2+ concentration and in a Ca2+-depleted medium. The
other showed that the inhibitory effect of �� Mconcentrations
of ouabain on K+ uptake in cultured astrocytes is
much less potent in the absence of Ca2+ in the incubation
medium.
2. Methods
2.1. Materials. Most chemicals, including isoproterenol,
ethacrynic acid, ouabain hydrochloride, the�� -adrenergic
receptor antagonists, betaxolol (4-(2-cyclopropylmethoxyethyl
)-1-phenoxy-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ol)
and ICI118551 (erythro-(±)-1(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-
3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol), the��
1
-adrenergic agonist
dobutamine, pertussis toxin (PTX), and the PKA inhibitor H-
89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide
) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA). The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Tyrphostin
AG 1478 (N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonymethyl)-4-
methyl-pentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide); the
metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM 6001 (1,4-diamino-
2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene); the
MEK inhibitor, U0126, (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis
[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene); and the Src inhibitor,
PP1 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-
d]pyrimidine) were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA,
USA). Horse serum was either drawn from selected animals
(Figure 3) or bought from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
The surfactant polyol Pluronic F-127 and P-1267 PBFI-AM
(124549-23-1/1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4�� -[1,4,10,13-

6,2-benzofurandiyl)]bis-, tetrakis[(acetyloxy)methyl]ester)
used for fluorescence determination of intracellular K+
concentration were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA).42KwasobtainedfromNewEnglandNuclear,
Lachine, Quebec (no longer available). Pentobarbital sodium
was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China).
2.2. MCAO. All experiments were carried out in accordance
with the USA National Institute of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications
number 80-23) revised 1978, and all experimental protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of China Medical University. The experiments
were carried out using rats, because it would have been very
difficult to effectively perform MCAO in mice, used routinely
for our cultures. In general, rats and mice are believed to react
in rather similar manners to brain ischemia. Male Sprague-
Dawley rats, weighing 280–320 g, were housed in cages on
a 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled (23–25∘C)
colony room with free access to food and water. Focal brain
ischemia was induced unilaterally by occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) as previously described by
Longa et al. [29] in animals anaesthetized with pentobarbital
sodium. A 30 mm segment of 4-0 Ethilon monofilament was
gently introduced from the common carotid artery into the
internal carotid artery lumen until a slight resistance was
felt.Thefilamenthadbeencoatedwithpolylysine,andits
tip was rounded by heating. The filament was withdrawn
3 hr after induction of ischemia. The animals were generally
decapitated 8 hr after reperfusion, but in some cases (part of
Figure 1) before reperfusion, and the brains were removed
for measurement of brain edema. Intraventricular injection
of drugs or saline (into the control animals) was made 15
minutes before the occlusion. The drugs were gently injected
intraventricularly, dissolved in 5�� Lphysiologicalsaline,at
the following concentrations: ethacrynic 50 mM; betaxolol
3mM;ICI11855110�� M; H89 500�� M; PTX 20�� M; PP1 1 mM;
AG1478 100�� M; GM6001 1 mM; U0126 1 mM. With a brain
weight in the rat of 1-2 g the intracerebral concentrations are
probably at least 100 times smaller but dependent upon the
distribution, which may vary between the individual drugs.

switching,” which in turn induces an enhancement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The
latter activates Zn-dependent metalloproteinases (MMPs) and leads to shedding of growth factor(s). The released epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor ligand stimulates phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in the same and adjacent cells. The downstream target of the EGF
receptor, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), shown in blue, is phosphorylated via the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. As shown in yellow ovals
the ERK phosphorylation by isoproterenol at high concentration can be inhibited by H-89, an inhibitor of protein-kinase A (PKA); by PTX,
an inhibitor of G
i
protein; by BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator; by GM6001, an inhibitor of Zn-dependent metalloproteinases;
by AG1478, an inhibitor of the receptor-tyrosine kinase of the EGF receptor; by siRNA against�� -arrestin 1 and less completely by siRNA
against�� -arrestin 2; and by U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, which directly phosphorylates ERK. In contrast, at low concentration (100 nM)��
2
-
adrenergic (green arrows) activation of the receptors activates Src via recruitment of�� -arrestin 2. Src in turn stimulates ERK phosphorylation
and phosphorylates EGF receptors at different sites than��
1
-adrenergic stimulation, without involvement of the receptor-tyrosine kinase.
Its ERK
1/2
phosphorylation is secondary to MEK activation, which may be induced by direct activation of Raf or Ras by Src. The ERK
phosphorylation by isoproterenol at low concentration can be inhibited by siRNA against�� -arrestin2;byPP1,aSrcinhibitor;andbythe
MEK inhibitor U0126. The effect of most of these inhibitors on MCAO-induced edema was investigated and tabulated in Table 3.
2.3. Determination of Edema. Wet weights (WW) were separately
measured in right hemispheres (ischemia side) and left
hemispheres (control side) after removal of cerebellum, pons,
and olfactory bulbs. Dry weights (DW) were determined after
24 hr heating at 120∘C as described by Bigdeli et al. [30], and
percentage brain water content in each sample was calculated
as[(WW−DW)/WW]×100. The difference in brain water
content between the ischemic and control sides indicates the
magnitudeoftheinducededema.
2.4. Cell Cultures. Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared
from newborn male or female Swiss mice as previously
described [31,32]. The neopallia of the cerebral hemispheres
were aseptically isolated, freed of meninges, dissociated
by vortexing, filtered twice through nylon meshes, diluted
in culture medium, and planted in 60 mm Falcon culture
dishes. The culture medium [ 32] was Dulbecco’s medium
oraveryslightlymodifiedDulbecco’smedium[ 31], both

Water content was calculated as[(wet weight−dry weight)/wet weight]×100% in rats where MCAO had been performed on the right side. In control rats no
significant change occurred with or without reperfusion. In animals with MCAO in the right hemisphere a small apparent increase in water content in thi s

of 2 weeks, 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP) was
included in the medium. This compound increases intracellular
cyclic AMP and promotes differentiation in astrocyte
cultures derived from newborn brain. Recently the usefulness
of astrocyte cultures has been authoritatively reviewed by
Lange et al. [33]. Close similarities between our cultures
and freshly isolated astrocytes in not only levels but also
development of aralar protein and mRNA expression [34]
andingenechangesintroducedbychronictreatmentwith
fluoxetine [ 35]supporttheirvalidityasmodelsoftheirin
vivo counterparts. Moreover, stimulation of glycogenolysis
by elevated extracellular K+,whichisessentialforitsuptake
intoastrocytes[17],onlyoccursaftertreatmentwithdBcAMP
[36].
2.5.DeterminationofIntracellularK+ Concentration. Determination
of potential increase in intracellular K+concentration
from its control value by an increase in extracellular K+
concentration or by dobutamide was determined as by Xu et
al. [17], using the K+-sensing fluorescent drug PBFI-AM. At
the start of the experiment astrocytes cultured on coverslips
coated with polylysine and placed within a Falcon Primaria
culture dish were loaded with 10�� M PBFI-AM with 0.2%
Pluronic F-127 in phosphate-buffered saline (concentrations

37∘C. After 2 times of wash with similar saline, the coverslip
was superfused with saline solution with or without Ca2+
for 2 min, after which KCl was added. Subsequently the
fluorescence intensity was recorded in each of∼20 individual
cells for 7 min with 20 sec interval at excitation wavelengths
of 340 (F340) and 380 (F380) nm. The ratio F340/F380 is an
arbitrary measurement of the intracellular K+concentration,
and its potential changes during the measurement are an
indication of K+ uptake rates. No calibration was made to
obtain absolute values.
2.6. Ouabain Effect on K+Uptake Rate in Media with and without
Ca2+. Unidirectional net uptake of K+ was determined
by exposing each culture for only 1.00 min (securing initial
uptake rates) to serum-free culturing medium containing
42Kat37∘C. In order to exclude homoexchange between
added42KandintracellularK+,thecultureshadinitially
been depleted for intracellular K+by a 10–15 min incubation
in ice-cold (1∘C) K+-free medium [37]. In order to rapidly
reheat the cultures the 1 min incubation was carried out with
the cultures floating on the surface of a water bath at 37∘C.
When ouabain was used it was present from the start of the
preincubation.
After the 1 min incubation in the presence of 42Kthe
cultures were washed three times with ice-cold 300 mM
sucrose solution. In each wash all adherent fluid in the culture
dish was removed with the aid of a fine nozzle connected to
awater-suctionpump.Thewholewashingprocedurelasted
for approximately 8 s. Such a short washing time is essential
to prevent a significant decrease of 42Kfromthecellsby
passive efflux. The effectiveness of this washing procedure has
previously been shown by very low amounts of potassium
uptake at 1∘C [ 31]. Subsequently, 1.00 mL of 1.0 M NaOH
was added,42K activity was counted in the cultures and
in the incubation media with the aid of a Beckman FL800
gamma counter, and protein content was determined by the
conventional Lowry technique [38].
Uptake rates were calculated from the uptake of42Kinto
the tissues and the specific activities of the media with due
consideration of the rapid decay of42K. The inhibition by
ouabain was determined from the differences in uptake rates
between cultures containing the inhibitor and cultures of
thesamebatchfromwhichitwasabsent.Atendencywas
observed towards a biphasic inhibition by ouabain, reflecting
differences between its effect on the ��
1
and��
2
subunitofthe
Na+,K+-ATPase.
2.7. Statistics. The statistical values of the differences between
individual groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed
by Fisher’s LSD test. The level of significance was set
at��<0.05 . GraphPad Prism 6 analysis of the results shown
inFigure 3was performed assuming a biphasic inhibition.
3. Results
3.1. Edema Occurs after Reperfusion. Table 1 shows brain
swellingintheipsi-andcontralateralhemispheresinducedby
MCAO. The determinations were made either immediately
after the ischemic period (3 hr) or after the tissue had been
reoxygenated for 8 hr. The results show that the edema
appears after the reoxygenation with little, if any, edema
formation during the ischemic period. This probably reflects
insufficient energy to drive the Na +,K+-ATPase during the
ischemic insult per se.

The signaling pathways for both ��

- and ��
2
-adrenergic
signaling H89 have been determined in cultured astrocytes
with the aid of specific inhibitors [ 39]. As shown inFigure 1,
phosphorylationofextracellularregulatedkinase1andkinase
2(ERK
1/2
) by isoproterenol is inhibited by H89, an inhibitor
of protein-kinase A (PKA) and thus of G
s
-mediated signaling
by isoproterenol. Pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of the
G
s
-G
i
switch occurring in the astrocytic signaling pathway
of��
1
-butnot��
2
-adrenergic signaling [39], has a similar
effect. In this pathway G
s
activation is followed by an increase
in[Ca2+]
i
, which in astrocytes leads to metalloproteinasemediated
release of a growth factor that transactivates the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Both the metalloproteinase
inhibitor GM6001 and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478
inhibit ERK
1/2
phosphorylation. So does U0126, an inhibitor
of ERK
1/2
phosphorylation. As can be seen from Table 2
each of these inhibitors also prevents��
1
-adrenergic edema
formationin vivoafter ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, the
SrcinhibitorPP1thatisactiveinthe��
2
-butnot��
1
-adrenergic
signaling [39] had no effect. The consistency between results
obtained in cultured astrocytes and the presentin vivoresults
further supports the validity of the used cultures as models
of theirin situcounterparts. This is important for the studies
described below.
3.4. Ca2+Dependence of K+-Mediated Increase in Intracellular
K+ Concentration. Figure 2 shows that in the presence of
Ca2+in the medium addition of 5 mM KCl causes a relatively
fast increase in intracellular K+ concentration similar in
magnitudetothatpreviouslyobserved[ 17]. In the absence
of extracellular Ca2+no such increase occurs. In contrast the
effect of the��
1
-adrenergic agonist dobutamine is independent
of the presence of Ca2+.
3.5. The Potency of Ouabain Is Reduced in the Absence of
Extracellular Ca2+. Figure 3shows inhibition of42Kuptake
by�� M concentrations of ouabain, expressed as percentage of
the uninhibited rate in cultures incubated either in medium
with a normal Ca2+ concentration (1.8 mM CaCl
2
) or in 
medium without added Ca2+.SincenoCa2+ chelator was
added, this medium is likely to contain traces of Ca2+.The
K+concentrationinthemediumwas5.4mMwith42Kadding
∼0.3 mM. Under control conditions (no ouabain present) the
uptake rates were identical in the presence and absence of
Ca2+ (275, resp., 282 nmol/min per mg protein). However,
the potency of ouabain was drastically reduced by ouabain
as seen fromFigure 3. In both types of media the GraphPad
analysis showed that a minor part of the uptake (∼20%)
is inhibited by the lower ouabain concentrations with high
affinity, and a major part of the uptake is inhibited by
higher ouabain concentrations. Unfortunately the individual
measurements have been lost, preventing calculation of SEM
values.However,somestatisticalinformationcanbeobtained
fromtheGraphPadanalysis,asdiscussedinthelegendofthe
figure, and the statistical significance of the difference with
and without Ca2+is obvious at 100�� Mouabain.Thepotency
ofouabainonthefractionwithloweraffinitywasalways
inhibited by Ca2+deficiency. However, at the lowest ouabain
concentrations there was a tendency towards a negative
inhibition, that is, a stimulation, mimicking the stimulatory
effect on Na+,K+-ATPaseactivitynormallyonlyobservableat
low nanomolar ouabain concentrations [17].

4. Discussion
4.1. Brain Edema and��
1
-Adrenergic Antagonists. This
study has demonstrated that the ionic alterations evoked
by ischemia (increase in extracellular K+ concentration,
decrease in extracellular Ca2+concentration) have profound
effects on edema formation and its inhibition by ��
1
-
adrenergic antagonists. The finding that edema does
not develop during the ischemic period but only after 
reoxygenation is consistent with the energy dependence
of the Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 transport system and
indicates that the MCAO effectively prevented blood
supply. It is in agreement with the observation by Goyagi
et al. [40] that administration of��
1
-adrenergic antagonist
30 min after the onset of a 2-hour-long ischemic period
drastically reduces infarct size and improves neurological
deficit score after 7 days. Iwata et al. [ 27] even found 
that administration of antagonists specifically of the ��
1

adrenoceptor beginning 60 min after 8 min bilateral carotid
artery occlusion combined with hypotension reduced
neuronal injury after forebrain ischemia, although motor
activity was not improved. Goyagi et al. [25,26]alsofound

Figure 3: Ouabain induced inhibition of net influx of 42Kinto

during a 1.00 min incubation, which provides initial uptake rates.
The graph marked by diamonds was obtained in a slightly modified
Dulbecco’s medium containing 1.8 mM Ca2+ (for further details
see Section 2) and that marked by X in a corresponding medium
containing no CaCl
2
. The inhibition was calculated from the ratios
between uptake rates in the absence of ouabain and that at the
ouabain concentration in question. The calculated inhibitions were
analyzed as a function of the ouabain concentration by GraphPad
Prism 6, assuming that they are biphasic, which gave the best fit.
SEM values for inhibition of cultures incubated at 1.8 mM Ca2+were
obtained from the standard errors given in the Graph Pad analysis
for, respectively, high and low affinity. For cultures incubated
without Ca2+SEM value for the lower concentrations (high affinity)
were similarly based on the Graph Pad analysis. A similar procedure
could not be used for the low-affinity component, since the total
inhibition did not approach 100%, and the computed standard error
accordingly was excessively high. Therefore no SEM values are
shown for the two highest concentrations, but they must resemble
those at the lower concentrations, since the original uptake readings
had approximately similar uncertainties at all concentrations. The
apparentstimulationatlowouabainconcentrationsintheabsenceof
Ca2+ reflects an ouabain-mediated stimulation of uptake, normally
occurring at low nanomolar concentrations [17]. In both graphs 6
cultures from 2-3 different batches had been used for each point.
index scores were significantly lower and neuronal survival
was better in rats treated with��
1
-adrenoceptor antagonists
beginning 30 min before 10 min of spinal cord ischemia [28].
Unfortunately, the Goyagi group also found that although the
��
1
-adrenergic antagonists provided long-term improvement
of histological outcome, they had no effect on neurological
outcome and spatial memory retention 14 days later, tested
with administration beginning 30 min before the onset of
ischemia and continuing for 24 hrs [26]. However, this does
not necessarily indicate failure of��
1
-adrenergic antagonists
to improve long-term functional recovery in brain ischemia.
Thisisbecause ��
1
-adrenergic stimulation exerts beneficial
effects, such as the stimulation of glycogenolysis, which is
essential for formation of memory [41–44]. It may therefore
be advantageous to discontinue treatment with��
1
-adrenergic
antagonist as soon as extracellular K+ concentration has
normalized. This will in the presence of ��

antagonist probably mainly be by neuronal uptake. It is
unlikely to require ouabain-mediated signaling, since it in
astrocytes serves to promote Na+ uptake for stimulation of
the intracellular site of the Na+,K+-ATPase [17], whereas
neurons increase intracellular Na+during excitation.
4.2. NKCC1 Antagonists. The demonstrated ability of
ethacrynic acid to abolish ischemia/reperfusion-induced
swelling is consistent with its inhibition of swelling and
uptake of Na+,K+,andCl− induced in monkey brain cortex
slices by a highly elevated K+ concentration [7]. It is an
indication that operation of NKCC1 is by far the dominant
mechanism for removal of highly elevated extracellular
K+ concentrations in brain. This is consistent with the
conclusion by Walz and Hertz [45] that the increase in
intracellular K+ content caused by elevation of extracellular
K+from 5 to 54 mM is entirely carrier mediated. A potential
neuroprotective ability of ethacrynic acid has previously
been studied in a combined trauma/hypoxia model of brain
injury in the cat and in a small clinical trial [46]. Ethacrynic
acid also had toxic side effects, which do not seem to be
shared by furosemide and the very specific NKCC1 blocker
bumetanide [47]. As already mentioned bumetanide inhibits
edema in experimental stroke following middle cerebral
occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent reperfusion [2–4]. In
cultured astrocytes it diminishes cell swelling and Na+,K+,
and Cl− accumulation after oxygen and glucose deprivation
[48]aswellastrauma-inducedastrocyteswelling[49].
4.3. Ca2+ and Ouabain Signaling. The rates for active K +
uptake in the absence of ouabain (∼280 nmol/min per mg
protein) are consistent with previously observed rates of
K+ uptake in similar cultures [31]andthebiphasiceffect
is explained by binding to two different Na+,K+-ATPase
subunits [50]. The drastic decrease in ouabain potency in
the absence of added Ca2+ in the medium (Figure 3) is 
in agreement with observation by Wang et al. [51] that 
a transmitter-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ triggers an
increase in K+ uptake in cultured astrocytes, which was
abolished by the NCX inhibitors SEA0400 and SN-6. The
same astrocyte-specific transmitter also evoked a transient
decrease in extracellular K+ in hippocampal slices. Finally,
glucose utilization in freely behaving rats in the presence
of elevated extracellular K+ concentrations [52] confirms 
a previously observed stimulation of oxygen consumption
rate in brain slices [53, 54]. The threshold concentration
of K+ evoking this effect (20 mM) [ 54] coincides with that
causing swelling in brain slices [8] and the stimulation is
inhibited by ethacrynic acid [55], indications that it is a 
metabolic manifestation of K+-stimulated K+ uptake. In the
present context it is important that the K+-induced metabolic
stimulation is abolished when Ca2+ is excluded from the
medium [54].
Although the present observations together with literature
data thus strongly suggest that extracellular Ca2+
depletion plays a major role by abolishing K+-induced, but
not��
1
-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of the Na+-K+-
ATPase/NKCC1 transport system, additional factors may
also be involved in edema formation. Thus, the cellular
increase in Ca2+, which is the reason for its extracellular
decrease, promotes NADH hyperoxidation and electrical
dysfunction after anoxia in hippocampal slices [ 56]. Not only
neurons are affected by the Ca2+ overload, since cultured
astrocytes rapidly die following anoxia and reperfusion when
the gaseous and interstitial ionic changes of transient brain
ischemia are simulated, and their death required external
Ca2+ [57]. Importantly, brain swelling requires additional
fluid uptake across the blood-brain barrier, which similarly
expresses NKCC1 [58]. To what extent this may have played
a role after the intraventricular injection of ��
1
-adrenergic
agonists (or of ethacrynic acid) used in the present study
is unknown. Finally, it should be noted that prestroke
use of��
1
-blockers in a thorough study was found not
to affect stroke severity or outcome clinically [ 59]. This
could, however, perhaps reflect that patients on continuous
��
1
-blocker treatment might receive doses providing lower
intracerebral concentrations than those employed in this
study and needed for protection against edema. To counteract
edema formation it may be essential to use high doses of��
1
-
adrenergic antagonists until extracellular K+has normalized.
It is unknown how long that takes, but an at least hourlong
increase in extracellular glucose level after seizures [ 60],
which also increase extracellular K+level, might suggest that
thiscouldtakealongtime,especiallywhenastrocyticK+
reaccumulation is inhibited.
5. Conclusions
The beneficial effects of ��
1
-adrenergic inhibition on infarct
size and edema in experimental ischemia/reperfusion are
convincing, even when added after the onset of ischemia.
Thisisagreatadvantageforpotentialclinicaluse,andit
is consistent with the present observation in this study that
most or all of the swelling occurs after reperfusion. The study
also confirmed an antiedema effect of NKKC1 inhibitors
and of��
1
-adrenergic antagonists and signaling inhibitors,
and it presented evidence that abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis
resulting from ischemia is the pathophysiological basis
for the mechanism by which��
1
-adrenergic inhibitors can
inhibit brain edema after anoxia/reperfusion. This seems
to be because Ca2+ deficiency counteracts stimulation of
the Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 transport system by elevated
extracellular K+, which requires signaling by endogenous
ouabains, and is thus dependent on extracellular Ca2+.
Accordingly��
1
-adrenoceptor activity is left as its only astrocytic
stimulus, and it was shown to be independent of
the presence of extracellular Ca2+.Eveninthepresenceof
a��
1
-adrenergic antagonist extracellular K+ will eventually
be reabsorbed by the neuronal Na+,K+-ATPase, which is
unlikely to require extracellular Ca2+,butthiswillnotleadto
swelling in adult brain, where NKCC1 is highly enriched in
astrocytes.
