Abstract The neutrophil collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-
8 (MMP8) is a recently identified member of MMPs that have
important roles in various inflammation-related disorders. Previously
, we identified MMP8 as a new neuroinflammatory
mediator in activated microglia by regulating TNF-α productivity.
Here, we present evidence that MMP8 is a critical
factor for brain damage in transient focal cerebral ischemia
by modulating neuroinflammation likely microglial activation
and TNF-α production. Biochemical analyses showed upregulation
of MMP8 expression at mRNA and protein levels in
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (M/R)-
challenged brains. Furthermore, double immunolabeling
showed that MMP8 expression was upregulated in the activated
microglia of M/R-challenged brains. Assessment of
infarct volume, neurological score, and survival/death of neural
cells revealed that administration of an MMP8 inhibitor
(M8I) immediately after reperfusion reduced brain damage.
Histological analyses showed that microglial activation and
TNF-α expression in ischemic conditions was abrogated by
exposure to M8I, as demonstrated in our previous study using
cultured microglia. These outcomes from a pharmacological
approach were reaffirmed by a genetic approach using a
lentiviral system. Intracerebroventricular microinjection of
MMP8-specific shRNA lentivirus reduced the extent of
ischemia-induced brain damage, as assessed by infarct volume
, neurological score, microglial activation, and TNF-α
expression. These results suggest a novel pathogenetic role
of MMP8 and implicate modulation of its activity as a
tractable strategy for therapies against cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is caused by insufficient blood flow to the
brain. It can lead to brain damage. Brain damage due to
cerebral ischemia can be driven by various pathogenetic factors
: excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation
[1,2]. Of these, neuroinflammation is now being regarded as a
key event for acceleration of brain damage in cerebral ischemia.
It is characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells,
including activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and infiltrated
immune cells, all of which can mediate brain damage
via production of various neurotoxic molecules [1, 3, 4].
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), zinc-dependent endopeptidases
, are well-known neuroinflammatory factors, leading
to brain damage. Current knowledge regarding their roles
in neuroinflammation indicates that upregulated expression of
MMPs has an important role in the pathogenesis of central
nervous system (CNS) disorders. Such increased expression
can lead to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, activation
of microglia and astrocytes in the CNS, and production of

neurotoxic molecules (e.g., free radicals and proinflammatory
cytokines) [5–7]. In this regard, MMP2,
MMP3, and MMP9 are the most important MMPs and have
been therapeutic targets to overcome cerebral ischemia [6,
8–11].
In addition to these well-known MMPs, a recently identified
subtype, MMP8, is believed to mediate a wide range of
inflammatory disorders. MMP8 has been reported to mediate
tissue damage in several peripheral immune disorders, such as
rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary diseases [12]. Recently,
MMP8 has become considered to be a key pathogenetic factor
in CNS damage in sepsis, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord
injury, all of which are featured by neuroinflammation
[13–15]. In addition, our previous studies using cultured microglia
and septic mice have demonstrated that pharmacological
or genetic blockade of MMP8 activity efficiently reduces
neuroinflammatory responses, including activation of microglia
and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [16,17]. In
particular, we demonstrated [17] that MMP8 is directly associated
with processing of TNF-α, a well-known key mediator
of neuroinflammation as well as cerebral ischemia-induced
brain damage [18–20]. Such functions would imply that
MMP8 regulates neuroinflammation in cerebral ischemia
and, more importantly, that MMP8 activity is critical for brain
damage in this disease.
Therefore, the potential roles of MMP8 in cerebral ischemia
need to be clarified, and this led us to investigate the
relationship between MMP8 activity and brain damage in
cerebral ischemia. Using validated pharmacological and genetic
tools to inhibit MMP8 activity [17], we provide evidence
that MMP8 is a new pathogenetic factor for cerebral ischemia
that may act by modulating microglial activation.
Materials and Methods
Animals, Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia,
and Administration of MMP8 Inhibitor
Male ICR mice (7 weeks old) were purchased from Orient
Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Republic of Korea), a branch of Charles
River Laboratories. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
reperfusion (M/R; 90 min of occlusion) as described previously
[21]. Briefly, the right MCAs of anesthetized mice were
occluded by inserting a 9-mm-long 5–0 nylon monofilament
coated with silicon from the bifurcation, and blood flow was
restored 90 min after MCAO by removing the monofilament.
The same surgical procedure was processed for the sham
group except insertion of the monofilament. Mice challenged
with M/R were divided randomly into two groups: vehicle
(1 % DMSO in saline) or MMP8 inhibitor (M8I) (5 mg/kg
body weight, i.p.), which was administered immediately after
reperfusion. All brain samples were obtained 22 h after reperfusion.
The volume of brain infarction was determined by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining followed by analysis
using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA). Neurological score was measured using a well-known
neurological severity score, as described previously [22].
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA (1 μg) isolated from the brain hemisphere where
the surgical procedure was processed for groups of sham and
M/R was reversely transcribed. Synthesized cDNA was used
as a template for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
employing the following primers (forward and reverse, respectively
): MMP8: 5′-CCAAGGAGTGTCCAAGCCAT-3′
and 5′-CCTGCAGGAAAACTGCATCG-3′; β-actin: 5′-
AGCCTTCCTTCTTGGGTATG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGCATC
CTGTCAGCAA-3′. qRT-PCR was undertaken on an
M×3005p system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with Brilliant
III Ultra-Fast SYBR® Green mix. Specific PCR products
were calculated as fold change relative to control after normalization
toβ-actin.
Western Blot Analysis
Proteins isolated from the brain hemisphere where the surgical
procedure was processed for groups of sham and M/R were
separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies
against MMP8 (1:1000) orβ-actin (1:1000). Membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1: 1000) and developed with an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit. Signal intensity was calculated
as fold change relative to control after normalization to
β-actin using ImageJ.
Histological Analyses
After the induction of anesthesia and perfusion with PBS (pH
7.4) followed by ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde, mouse
brains were removed. Brains were incubated in fixative and
30 % sucrose solution, embedded in Tissue-Tek® optimal
cutting temperature compound and frozen on powdered dry
ice. Cryostat brain sections (20μm) were used for histology.
To assess survival of neural cells, tissue sections were
stained with Nissl by incubation in solution with 0.5 % cresyl
violet. Alternatively, sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade®
B (0.001 % Fluoro-Jade B in 0.09 % acetic acid) to assess
death of neural cells. Color or fluorescent images were obtained
using a bright-field or fluorescent microscope equipped
with a DP72 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were
prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS3.

Immunohistochemistry was undertaken to detect MMP8,
activated microglia, and TNF-α by labeling sections with
antibodies against MMP8 (1:100), Iba1 (1:500), and TNF-α
(1:100), respectively. Sections were labeled with appropriate
secondary biotinylated antibodies, incubated in a solution
containing avidin/biotin complex, and developed with 3,3′-
diaminobenzidine. Double immunolabeling was also done to
detect MMP8 in activated microglia. Briefly, sections processed
for MMP8 (brown) were rinsed and blocked with
avidin/biotin followed by 5 % normal donkey serum. Sections
were incubated with an antibody against Iba1, secondary
biotinylated antibody, and avidin/biotin complex. Signals for
Iba1 were visualized using an SG substrate kit (blue-gray).
Color images were obtained using a bright-field microscope
equipped with a DP72 camera (Olympus). Alternatively, double
immunofluorescence was carried out to detect claudin-5
on CD31-positive endothelial cells. Sections were labeled
with antibodies against claudin-5 (1:300) and CD31 (1:300)
followed by labeling with Alexa Fluor®488- and Cy5-
conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections were stained with
DAPI and mounted with VECTASHIELD® Mounting Media.
Fluorescent images were collected using confocal microscopy
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For quantification, three images were
obtained at ×20 magnification from each section using a
bright-field or fluorescent microscope equipped with a DP72
camera (Olympus), and the mean number of MMP8-, Iba1-,
TNF-α-, or claudin-5-positive cells in each group was calculated
from the three images.
Intracerebroventricular Injection of MMP8-Specific
and Control shRNA Lentiviral Particles
Lentiviral particles (3 μL/3 min, i.c.v.) for mouse MMP8-
specific shRNA (MMP8 Mission® shRNA; 1×106 TU/mL;
pLKO.1 vector) or non-target shRNA control (Mission®
pLKO.1 puro non-target shRNA control) were administered
into the right lateral ventricle using stereotaxic coordinates
from an atlas on mouse brains. The sequence for MMP8-
specific shRNA was CCGGGCCTTGATGTACCCAAAC
TATCTCGAGATAGTTTGGGTACATCAAGGCTTTTTG.

Results
MMP8 Expression is Upregulated in the Brain
of M/R-Challenged Mice
To ascertain if MMP8 expression is upregulated in brains with
cerebral ischemia, brains were isolated from sham- and M/R-
operated groups and processed for qRT-PCR, Western blotting
, and immunohistochemistry. Increased expression of
MMP8 mRNA was observed in M/R-challenged brains compared
with brains from sham groups (Fig.1a). This upregulation
was accompanied by changes in the expression of MMP8
protein (Fig.1b, c). Next, we ascertained if MMP8 is localized
in activated microglia, as verified in our previous study, using
double immunolabeling. MMP8 was expressed in activated
microglia after M/R challenge (Fig. 1c; MMP8, brown; Iba1,
blue-gray), which is in accordance with our previous LPS-
challenged in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating activated
microglia as a cell type for MMP8 production [17]. The
present study, demonstrating upregulation of MMP8 expression
in M/R-challenged brains, specifically activated microglia
, suggests that MMP8 may act as a pathogenetic factor for
cerebral ischemia.
Pharmacological Blockade of MMP8 Reduces Brain Damage
in M/R-Challenged Mice
We used a pharmacological approach to ascertain if MMP8
acts as a pathogenetic factor for cerebral ischemia. Mice were
administered vehicle (1 % DMSO in saline) or the MMP8-
specific inhibitor M8I (5 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after reperfusion
, and the therapeutic potential of M8I was examined.
Compared with vehicle treatment, M8I administration significantly
decreased total infarct volume (Fig. 2a, b) and improved
the neurological score (Fig. 2c). This neuroprotective
effect of M8I was confirmed by assessing the survival and
death of brain cells by using staining with Nissl (Fig. 2d)and
Fluoro-Jade B (Fig. 2e), respectively. These data demonstrated
that inhibition of MMP8 reduces brain damage after M/R.
Given the proposed pathogenetic role of MMP8 in
M/R-challenged brains, we determined its relationship
with microglial activation, one of the main events during
cerebral ischemia. M8I administration significantly
reduced the numbers of Iba1-positive cells in the brain
(Fig. 3a), showing a close relationship between MMP8
expression and microglial activation. Next, we determined
TNF-α expression in M/R-challenged brains because
TNF-α is a neurotoxic molecule involved in cerebral
ischemia [18–20] and MMP8 activity is closely

related to its production [17]. M/R increased the number
of cells bearing TNF-α in the brain, which was significantly
reduced by M8I administration (Fig. 3b). Collectively
, MMP8 may play an important role in M/R-
induced cerebral ischemia by modulating microglial activation
and TNF-α expression.
MMP8 Downregulation using its Specific shRNA Reduces
Brain Damage in M/R-Challenged Mice
We identified the role of MMP8 in ischemia utilizing
M8I, which is reaffirmed by a genetic approach using a
validated MMP8-specific shRNA lentivirus that has been
reported to efficiently downregulate MMP8 expression
[17]. To confirm that the lentivirus induces MMP8 knockdown
in M/R-challenged brains, MMP8 expression was
determined by immunohistochemical analyses and compared
between M/R-challenged brains injected with control
shRNA and MMP8-specific shRNA lentiviruses. The number
of MMP8-positive cells was much lower in M/R-
challenged brains injected with MMP8-specific shRNA
lentivirus than those injected with the control virus
(Fig. 4a). This shRNA-induced knockdown of MMP8
significantly reduced brain infarction (Fig. 4b, c) and 
improved the neurological score (Fig. 4d) in M/R-challenged
mice compared with the control virus-infected
group, which is consistent with results from a pharmacological
approach using M8I. MMP8 knockdown also significantly
reduced brain cell death (Fig. 4e, f), microglial
activation (Fig. 5a), and TNF-α expression (Fig. 5b) in 
M/R-challenged brains. Data from a functional genetic
approach independently support a role for MMP8, which
complement results from a pharmacological approach (i.e.,
M8I administration).
Pharmacological and Genetic Blockade of MMP8 Reduces
a Disruption of Claudin-5 in the BBB in M/R-Challenged
Mice
BBB permeability and damage are increased through MMPsmediated
degradation of tight junction proteins (TJPs), such as
claudin-5, during cerebral ischemia, which can be reduced by
inhibiting MMPs [23]. To identify whether MMP8 is also
involved in the disruption, we determined the cellular localization
of endothelial claudin-5 in the infarcted cerebral cortex
by double immunofluorescence labeling when MMP8 activity
was increased. As shown in Fig. 6, claudin-5 signals mostly
appeared to co-localize with endothelial marker CD31-
positive microvessels in sham mice. As expected, claudin-5
expression on endothelial cells was decreased in the brain
cortex of M/R mice, which was consistent with the previous
report [24]. The reduction of claudin-5 expression was reversed
either by the treatment with M8I or infection with
MMP8-specific shRNA lentivirus. These results support that
MMP8 is involved in BBB disruption after cerebral ischemia.
Discussion
Given the proposed novel role of MMP8 in the regulation of
neuroinflammatory responses in activated microglia, we evaluated
MMP8 as a possible therapeutic target to improve
cerebral ischemia. Combined in vivo results utilizing pharmacological
and genetic approaches identified a functional role
for MMP8 as a novel pathogenetic factor for cerebral ischemia
and demonstrated inhibition of MMP8 activity as an efficient
neuroprotective tool against cerebral ischemia. Inhibition of
MMP8 expression after occlusion by a specific inhibitorbased
pharmacological approach results in protection against

cerebral ischemia. In addition, downregulation of MMP8
expression by a shRNA lentivirus-based genetic approach is
associated with prevention of cerebral ischemia. With respect
to prevention and protection, it is obvious that MMP8 modulates
neuroinflammatory events, such as microglial activation
and TNF-αproduction, all of which are critical components of
cerebral ischemia.
The role of MMPs in cerebral ischemia has been studied
extensively. In the ischemic brain, MMPs induce BBB dysfunction
, neuroinflammation, and death of neuronal cells [6,
25, 26]. So far, a dozen MMP inhibitors (most of which
mainly target MMP2, MMP3, and/or MMP9) are in
preclinical/clinical trials for stroke prevention [6, 10, 11].
The present study adds MMP8 as another potential target to
improve cerebral ischemia: MMP8 expression was increased
significantly in M/R-induced mouse brains and specific inhibition
of MMP8 dramatically reduces brain damage. In particular
, M/R-induced brain damage was reduced by M8I even
after occlusion, strongly implying the neuroprotective actions
of M8I. Thus, our findings suggest that MMP8 is not only a
pathological mediator but also a novel target for the treatment
of cerebral ischemia. In particular, M8I can be applied to other
CNSdisorders,suchasmultiplesclerosis,spinalcordinjury,
and traumatic brain injury, in which MMP8 expression is
upregulated [13, 14, 27].
Employed biochemical analysis in this study clearly
showed that MMP8 was upregulated after transient focal
cerebral ischemia at the levels of both mRNA and protein.
However, a recent finding by Lenglet et al. [28] was somewhat
different: there was no change in some of MMPs, including
our target (MMP8), MMP3, and MMP12. In case of MMP8,
its protein expression was not increased after ischemic challenge
even with its upregulation at mRNA level, which was
demonstrated to be possible by miRNA modulation. The
differences between current and the previous [28] studies are
experimental conditions (occlusion time and mouse species:
90 or 60 min occlusion and ICR or 129/Sv mice in our or their
study), which may be conceivable, but not fully explain for the
discrepancy on MMP8 expression after ischemia at this moment.
The discrepancy was not confined to MMP8. It was so
with MMP3. But, many groups have reported MMP3 upregulation
after cerebral ischemia [29–31]. In case of MMP8,
there also have been experimental evidences showing MMP8
upregulation after cerebral ischemia in rodent models and
human patients [30, 32], which is in line with our findings.
In particular, in the latter report, MMP8 upregulation was
detected at protein level in the injured human brains as shown
in the findings here. In view of the importance of relevant
clinical data, MMP8 protein upregulation observed in infarct
brains from human patients [30] may support a critical role of
MMP8 in cerebral ischemia.
Neuroinflammation, a featured pathogenesis of diverse
CNS diseases, including cerebral ischemia, is involved in
augmented damage at lesion sites in the brain [1, 3]. Several
cell types from different systems are involved in this event. In
the CNS, activation of neuroglia (including astrocytes and

microglia) is a key event and produces various inflammatory
molecules, including cytokines, thus inducing tissue damage
[4]. MMP8 activity in cerebral ischemia seems to be closely
associated with neuroinflammation as other types of MMPs,
particularly MMP2 and MMP9 [33,34], and the link between
upregulated MMP8 expression and neuroinflammation in cerebral
ischemia may be detrimental. In the present study,
MMP8 in the brain was upregulated, at least in activated
microglia, and inhibition or genetic suppression of it reduced
or blocked microglial activation in cerebral ischemia. Indeed,
our previous in vitro study demonstrated that MMP8 expression
is upregulated in LPS-stimulated microglia, leading to
production of neurotoxic molecules, including nitric oxide,
IL-6, and TNF-α [17]. In particular, TNF-α activity was
shown to be regulated directly by MMP8. MMP8 itself possesses
TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) activity and its
specific inhibitor, M8I, inhibits TACE activity efficiently
[17]. In accordance with this notion, we observed that M8I
or MMP8 shRNA significantly reduced the number of
TNF-α-immunopositive cells in M/R-challenged brains. In
this regard, microglial activation and increased TNF-α activity
may explain how MMP8 mediated brain damage during
cerebral ischemia in the present study.
Besides modulation of microglial activation and cytokine
production, MMP8 can be associated with BBB disruption
that is a feature of cerebral ischemia [2]. A family of MMPs
has become associated with BBB disruption in CNS disorders.
In particular, some MMPs are known to aggravate brain
damage by eliciting structural changes in components involved
in BBB integrity during cerebral ischemia [25]. In this
regard, MMP2 and MMP9 are the most studied components
for the disruption, and their roles have been linked in facilitation
of infiltration of immune cells into the brain [26,35,36].
MMP9 has been suggested to be associated with severe disruption
of the BBB in cerebral ischemia based on studies
using a rodent model and human subjects: levels of the active
form of MMP9 were elevated markedly in plasma and/or
brain homogenates only at later stages (≈24 h after onset)
[37, 38]. Similarly, in the present study, MMP8 expression
was upregulated markedly in terms of mRNA and protein
levels 22 h after reperfusion, suggesting MMP8 also could

be associated with BBB disruption. In accordance with this
notion, growing evidences have demonstrated that MMP8
acts as a new factor for BBB dysfunction and related inflammatory
responses in bacterial meningitis, multiple sclerosis,
and sepsis [13, 15, 39]. In this study, we also found that
MMP8 inhibition or its knockdown blocked M/R-induced
downregulation of claudin-5 protein, one of well-known TJPs
that maintain the permeability properties of the BBB. Therefore
, the observed neuroprotection by M8I or MMP8-specific
shRNA could come from, at least in part, BBB maintenance.
In this study, we have focused on the detrimental role of
MMP8 in cerebral ischemia, but, it is possible that MMP8
plays beneficial roles as other types of MMPs. In fact, it is a
common knowledge that MMPs have a dual role in the
pathophysiology of CNS diseases. At the early stage of CNS
diseases, MMPs are rapidly upregulated, which, in turn, opens
the BBB, leading to neuronal cell death. At later stages,
however, MMPs are known to be involved in brain repair by
inducing angiogenesis, BBB restoration, axonal growth,
remyelination, etc. [5]. Thus, an early short-term inhibition
of MMPs would have good therapeutic outcomes. In this
regard, the upregulated MMP8 may play detrimental roles at
the acute stage of cerebral ischemia, as observed in this study,
but it may also do beneficial roles at the chronic stage. In fact,
MMP8 could play an important pro-angiogenic role and promote
tissue recovery during the recovery phase after stroke as
reported in atherosclerotic plaque [40]. In contrast, MMP8
upregulation in brain inflammation is involved in BBB disruption
[13–15] and persistent overexpression of MMP8 leads
to insufficient angiogenesis and tissue repair [41]. Therefore,
the inhibition of overexpressed MMP8 at the early stage may
produce beneficial effects for angiogenesis and tissue repair.
In support of this notion, there is a report demonstrating that
early inhibition of MMP activity in ischemic brain promotes
expression of tight junction proteins and angiogenesis during
the recovery phase [42]. We also observed that MMP8 inhibition
at the early stage of cerebral ischemia resulted in BBB
maintenance as determined by claudin-5 expression. Collectively
, MMP8 may have pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic
properties depending on its expression levels and/or stages of
tissue injury. Therefore, fine tuning of MMP8 may be necessary
to get the best outcome for brain recovery after stroke.
In the CNS, aberrant expression of MMPs is linked to
neuroinflammation-related disorders. A recently identified
subtype, MMP8, is believed to mediate neuroinflammation
and has been proposed as a molecular target to overcome
neuroinflammation-associated disorders. The present study
adds cerebral ischemia as a possible disorder for which inhibition
of MMP8 is effective: we demonstrated that inhibition
of MMP8 expression reduces ischemic damage accompanied
by reduced neuroinflammation. In addition, we showed that
MMP8 expression is upregulated in the ischemic brain (including
activated microglia) and that its activity can be
associated with TNF-αexpression. In cerebral ischemia, several
types of MMPs, such as MMP2, 3, and 9, also play crucial
roles, involving BBB breakdown, cerebral edema, hemorrhagic
transformation, and neuroinflammation [10, 29, 33,
34]. Although it is unclear whether MMP8 mediate a unique
pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, it is clear that a specific
inhibition of MMP8 is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia.
Particularly, the latter could be noteworthy in drug development
in view of reduced side effects via targeting a
specific MMP. In addition, it would be interesting to identify
a specific cell type for MMP8 upregulation and functions
because other cell types that have been regarded to be important
in cerebral ischemia, such as neurons and astrocytes, may
possibly produce MMP8. For this, conditional null mutants
for MMP8 will be the best tool if they are available in the
future. Collectively, even though there are many points remain
to be identified, our findings suggest that MMP8 is a
pursuable target against cerebral ischemia and that development
of MMP8-specific inhibitors may provide therapeutic
benefits in treating this disorder.
