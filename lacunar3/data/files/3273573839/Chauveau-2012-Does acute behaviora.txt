Background Models of intraluminal middle cerebral artery
occlusion present an intrinsic variability in infarct size.
Behavioral evaluation is frequently performed during arterial
occlusion to confirm success of surgery.
Aims and/or hypothesis We compared the value of behavioral
testing and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging performed
during arterial occlusion for identifying successfully
operated animals.
Methods Rats were tested with behavioral assessment
(using three scoring scales and the adhesive removal test)
and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (including
magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion-weighted and
perfusion-weighted imaging), both performed during the
two-hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion using the
intraluminal suture model. Behavioral assessment was
repeated 24 h after reperfusion, followed by sacrifice.
Results Acute apparent diffusion coefficient lesion volume
was correlated with both 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
infarct size (r = 0·75, P = 0·02) and behavioral status
(r = 0·66,P = 0·05) on day one. Conversely, no correlation was
found between acute behavioral examination and day one
outcomes (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride infarct
volume, r = 0·40, P = 0·28; behavioral examination, r = 0·39,
P = 0·30). Day zero apparent diffusion coefficient volumes
(P = 0·04), but not behavioral assessment (P = 0·60),
discriminated animals with day one corticostriatal infarcts
from these with subcortical infarcts.
Conclusions Acute behavioral testing performed during
arterial occlusion fails to identify successfully operated
animals. Acute diffusion magnetic resonance imaging may
be more appropriate to assess and reduce infarct size variability
in this model.

Introduction
Over the past decades, neuroprotection in stroke has encountered
a translational roadblock (1); despite promising experimental
results with numerous compounds, none proved
effective in clinical trials (2). The Stroke Therapy Academic
Industry Roundtable initiated a series of recommendations
that stressed the importance of strict quality control in preclinical
studies (3). Several aspects of study design, such as
randomization, blinding, statistical power, and, hence, reproducibility
of results, were scrutinized (4,5), but inclusion/
exclusion criteria for individual animals received less
attention. These criteria, however, are crucial if the interindividual
variations in infarct size inherent to stroke models are
to be taken into account. In intraluminal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) models, interspecies variability and
interlaboratory differences in protocols are the source of significant
variability in success and complications rates, and
lesion volume (6). The expected end-point for intraluminal
procedures is a corticostriatal infarct observed on the day following
surgery, which retrospectively defines the success or
failure of the model.
Behavioral evaluation performed during arterial occlusion
has frequently been used to assess success of surgery (7). On
the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables a
direct measure of acute brain tissue status, highlighting the
developing ischemic injury with diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) and surrounding hypoperfusion with perfusionweighted
imaging (PWI) (8,9).

Aims and/or hypothesis
The evaluation of ischemic animals, whether using behavior
or imaging, benefits neuroprotection studies in which treatment
is administered after ischemia onset, by reducing variability.
We compared the value of behavioral testing and
multimodal MRI performed during arterial occlusion for
identifying successfully operated animals (i.e. with corticostriatal
infarct on day 1), and deciding on their inclusion before
administrating treatment. We hypothesized that the relationship
between behavioral examination and lesion size was
inconsistent during arterial occlusion. In particular, we questioned
the ability of behavioral testing to discriminate
between expected corticostriatal and subcortical infarcts.
Methods
All procedures used in this study were performed after
approval by our institutional review board. Animals were
housed in Plexiglas cages in groups of six in a colony room
maintained on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (07:00–19:00 h).
Overall protocol
On day 0 (D0), Male Sprague Dawley rats (n= 14, Janvier,
France) weighing 250–350 g were anesthetized with isoflurane
(1–2%) in ambient air, and underwent transient MCAO for
120 mins or sham surgery (as detailed later). MRI with DWI
systematically acquired at 40 mins postocclusion, then
scanned animals; after completion of MRI within the first
hour of occlusion, the animals were awoken for the first
session of neurobehavioral examination. This was performed
90 mins to 110 mins after ischemia onset, by an investigator
(M. W.) blind to surgery and MRI results, and was followed by
reanesthesia and reperfusion.
The second session of neurobehavioral examination was
performed by the same investigator at 24 h postreperfusion
(D1), and was immediately followed by animal sacrifice.
Surgery
The intraluminal suture model was used for induction of
focal cerebral ischemia. Surgical procedure was derived from
Longa et al. (10), except that the common carotid artery was
permanently ligated. The external carotid artery was electrocoagulated
and transected to enable insertion of a coated
monofilament (0·37 mm diameter, Doccol Corporation,
Redlands, CA). This was gently advanced until the tip reached
the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The filament
was not advanced to the bifurcation in sham controls (n= 2).
To alleviate pain, animals received 0·05 mg/kg subcutaneous
buprenorphine immediately after reperfusion anesthesia.
During surgery, body temperature was monitored continuously
with a rectal probe and maintained at 37·0 0·5°C by a
feedback-regulated heating pad.
Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI experiments were performed on a Bruker Biospec
7T/12 cm horizontal magnet equipped with Paravision 5.0
(Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). A birdcage head coil of 72 mm
inner diameter was used for radiofrequency transmission, and
a 25 mm-diameter surface coil was used for reception. The
rats were placed in a cradle equipped with a stereotaxic holder,
an integrated heating system to maintain body temperature
at 37 1°C, and a pressure probe to monitor respiration.
Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was
performed using a two-dimensional multislice gradient
echo sequence with matrix= 256¥ 128, field of view (FOV) =
3·7¥ 2·5 cm2, 80 contiguous slices with slice thickness of
0·3 mm and interslice overlap of 0·15 mm, echo time/
repetition time (TE/TR) = 5/25 ms, and two averages.
T2-weighted images were acquired using a RARE sequence
with matrix= 256¥ 256, FOV= 4¥ 4cm 2, seven noncontiguous
slices with slice thickness of 1·5 mm and interslice gap of
0·5 mm, TE/TR= 75/3000 ms, and two averages. DWI echo
planar imaging (EPI) spin-echo images were acquired using
the same FOV and slice characteristics as above, with
matrix= 128¥ 128, TE/TR= 25/2000 ms, and three b-values
(0, 1500, and 3000 s/mm2). PWI was performed with multislice
dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI (DSCMRI
), using an EPI gradient-echo sequence with the same
FOV and slice characteristics (matrix = 96¥ 96 and TE/TR
4·84/100 ms). One hundred consecutive images were acquired
per slice with a time resolution of 0·6 s during which a 0·2-ml
bolus of gadolinium (Dotarem, Guerbet Aulnay-sous-Bois,
France) was injected intravenously after acquisition of the
15th image.
Image analysis
An investigator (F. C.) blind to surgery and behavioral examination
performed image analysis. Maximum intensity projection
analysis of angiography images was used to assess MCA
occlusion. An angiographical score was defined for semiquantitative
analysis:
• 0= undetectable flow along the whole MCA route (complete
occlusion)
• 1= decreased flow signal (partial occlusion), and
• 2= normal flow signal (no occlusion).
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (in mm2/s)
were calculated by fitting MR signal curves to a monoexponential
model function on a pixel-by-pixel basis using
in-house software written in Matlab 2009 (MathWorks,
Natick, MA). Contrast agent-induced signal intensity changes
from DSC-MRI images were converted to changes in the
transverse relaxation rate 1/T2* (i.e. DR2*) according to the
formula DR2*=- 1/TE.lnS(t)/S0, where S0 is the precontrast
baseline signal intensity and S(t) is the signal intensity at time
t. Time-to-peak maps are commonly used clinically to assess
hypoperfusion (11); however, the low temporal resolution

compared to bolus first-pass duration hampered their use in
the present rodent study, and perfusion maps were therefore
generated using the image corresponding to the DR2* timecurve
peak, or maximum peak concentration (MPC) (12).
ADC and MPC maps were then analyzed on MIPAV software
(Medical Image Processing And Visualization, NIH, Bethesda,
MD; http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/). Ipsilateral regions of hypointense
signal (compared to contralateral hemisphere) were
manually delineated on ADC or MPC maps. That on the MPC
map was mirrored onto the contralateral hemisphere to calculate
the ipsi-to-contralateral mean MPC ratio.
Behavioral examination
Behavioral evaluation was performed using three previously
reported scoring scales (‘neuroscores’): 0–3, by Bedersonet al.
(13); 0–9, by Perez-Asensio et al. (14); and 0–20, by van der
Zijden et al. (15). These scales consist in simple sensorimotor
tasks (gait, parachute reflex, lateral resistance, limb placing)
for the assessment of the extent of lateralized neurological
deficits. Higher neuroscores reflect stronger deficits. Evaluation
also included the adhesive-removal test (ART) (16), for
which the animals were trained for two-days before surgery.
Because most animals proved unable to remove adhesives
during the one-minute recording time, the ability to remove
adhesives from both forelimbs was scored on three trials as
follows:
• 0= successful adhesive removal (whatever the recorded
time)
• 1= failed attempt to remove, and
• 2= no attempt.
Final infarct volume
Animals were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital.
Immediately after sacrifice, brains were removed and 3-mmthick
axial sections cut with a brain matrix (Harvard Apparatus
, Les Ulis, France) were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France).
Brains were digitally photographed. An operator blind to
surgery and MRI analysis (M. W.) manually outlined
unstained areas on all sections using ImageJ software (Image
Processing and Analysis in Java, NIH; http://rsb.info.
nih.gov/ij/). Final infarct volumes were measured by integrating
lesion areas with slice thickness.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (Version
15·0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), with statistical significance
threshold set at P < 0·05. Nominal parameters (ADC,
MPC, TTC volumes, and MPC ratios) are reported as
mean standard deviation, while ordinal parameters (neuroscores
and angiography scores) are reported as median (min;
max). Correlations were determined by Spearman’s rho analysis
; correlation robustness was assessed by repeating analysis
after exclusion of the sham-operated animals. One-way analysis
of variance followed by Tamhane’s post hoc paired comparisons
was performed to compare three groups defined as:
• sham-operated animals
• animals with subcortical infarct, and
• animals with corticostriatal infarct.
Results
One of the 14 operated animals died before completion of the
protocol and was excluded from analysis. Thirteen rats were
imaged, functionally examined, reperfused on day 0 (D0), and
reexamined on day 1 (D1). Minor subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) was detected in two after sacrifice and these were
retrospectively excluded from analysis. This left 11 animals
included in the study. Individual behavioral, imaging, and
histological features are available in Table 1.
Final infarct size on TTC staining (Fig. 1)
Five animals (#1 to 5) demonstrated a D1 corticostriatal
infarct as expected for a two-hour MCAO (405 95 mm3).
One (#6) showed a subcortical infarct with a small and atypical
pattern of cortical infarction, encompassing part of the
piriform cortex but sparing sensorimotor areas. One animal
(#7) had a lesion restricted to the striatum. Four (#8–11),
including the two sham-operated animals (#10–11), had no
visible infarct.
MRI (Fig. 1)
Large corticostriatal lesions were detectable on the average
diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of four animals (#1, 3, 4, 5),
all showing typical corticostriatal infarcts at 24 h postreperfusion.
The two sham-operated animals had no visible lesion
on the ADC maps (#10–11), and showed no infarct on day 1.
The five remaining animals (#2, 6, 7, 8, 9) exhibited only
subcortical and/or hypothalamic damage, with no or very
limited cortical involvement (#6, piriform cortex), on ADC
maps. In these five animals, lesion size evolution from D0 to
D1 was heterogeneous: on D1, two had a corticostriatal infarct
(#2 and 6), two completely recovered and showed no visible
infarct (#8 and 9), and one had a lesion restricted to the
striatum (#7).
All rats underwent DSC-MRI, but the EPI dataset could be
exploited in eight cases only, due to susceptibility artifacts at
skull base. All animals showed an extended perfusion defect
(340 90 mm3). MPC ratios were lower (n= 6, 0·39
0·06 mm3) in ischemic animals than in sham controls (n= 2,
0·70 0·06 mm3).
MRA showed a complete occlusion in four animals (score 0:
#3, 4, 5, 7), partial occlusion in three (score 1: #1, 6, 9), and no
occlusion in four (score 2: #2, 8, 10, 11).

Behavioral examination (Fig. 2)
Sham-operated animals (#10 and 11) showed minor behavioral
deficits (3 or less on the 0–20 neuroscore) during occlusion
on D0, but no deficits on D1. They consistently succeeded in
ART.
All other animals (#1 to 9) showed severe deficits and failed
to remove the adhesives during occlusion on D0: median
scores [min; max] were 3 [3; 3] on the 0–3 scale, 7 [5; 9] on the
0–9 scale, 14 [13; 17] on the 0–20 scale, and 2 [1; 2] for the
ART. On D1, severe neurological impairment (13–16/20) as
well as adhesive removal inability persisted in the five animals
showing typical corticostriatal infarct on TTC staining (#1 to
5). Conversely, the three animals with no or striatumrestricted
lesion (#7 to 9) completely recovered (no behavioral
deficits and successful adhesive removal). The animal showing
an atypical infarct (#6) had a moderate deficit (6/20).
Correlations
Sham animals were excluded from the correlation analysis
because those animals with neither lesion nor neurological
deficit bias the results by artificially increasing Spearman’s rho
coefficients for all parameters. Multiple variable interactions
were not studied. Similar correlation coefficients were
obtained whichever score was used (0–3, 0–9, 0–20, or ART
score). Therefore, only results on the 0–20 neuroscore are
reported hereafter.
Significant correlations were found between:
• D1 neuroscores and D1 TTC infarct volumes (r= 0·90,
P= 0·001);
• D0 ADC lesion volumes and D1 TTC infarct sizes (r= 0·75,
P= 0·02, Fig. 3a);
• D0 ADC lesion volumes and D1 neuroscores (r= 0·66,
P= 0·05).
Conversely, no correlation was found between:
• D0 neuroscores and D1 TTC infarct volumes (r= 0·40,
P= 0·28, Fig. 3b);
• D0 neuroscores and D1 neuroscores (r= 0·39, P= 0·30);
and
• D0 neuroscores and D0 ADC lesion volumes (r= 0·53,
P= 0·14, Fig. 4a).
In addition, neither angiography nor perfusion parameters
correlated with another volumetric or behavioral variable
(Fig. 4b).
Comparisons
Three groups were compared:
• animals with the expected corticostriatal infarct on D1
(#1–5, n= 5);
• animals with subcortical infarct and no or minor cortical
involvement (#6–9, n= 4); and
• sham-operated animals (#10–11, n= 2).
Corticostriatal infarcts were larger than subcortical infarcts
(385 98 vs. 41 51 mm3,P= 0·001), and these two groups

vs. 60 44 mm3, P= 0·04). Sham-operated animals had no
D0 or D1 lesion. D1 neuroscores discriminated the corticostriatal
infarcts from subcortical infarcts (13 [11; 16] vs. 0 (0,6),
P= 0·004), but this was not the case for D0 neuroscores (15
[13; 17] vs. 14 [13; 15], P= 0·60). Conversely, sham-operated
animals were discriminated from subcortical infarcts on D0
(2·5 [2; 3] vs. 14 [13; 15],P= 0·004), but not on D1 (0·5 (0,1)
vs. 0 (0,6), P= 0·92). Similar results were obtained using the
other neurological scores.
Discussion
Models of proximal MCAO present substantial interindividual
variability in lesion size, as a result of endogenous (collateral
circulation, MCA diameter, and vulnerability to
ischemia (17,18)) and technical (placement, size, manufacturing
method of occluders (6,19)) factors. Controlling this variability
is crucial for the statistical power and interlaboratory
comparison of neuroprotection studies in cerebral ischemia.
Inclusion criteria are required. We compared the value of

behavioral testing vs. MRI for the acute identification of successfully
operated animals, using the intraluminal suture
model with permanent ligation of the common carotid artery.
All animals were evaluated back-to-back with neurobehavioral
tests and MRI during the two-hour MCAO (day 0, D0).
They were assessed 24 h after reperfusion (day 1, D1) for the
expected sensorimotor deficits and corticostriatal infarcts.
Using histology or MRI as comparators, a wide array of
functional tests has been evaluated for their ability to reflect
infarct size at the subacute stage in intraluminal or other stroke
models. Series of simple sensorimotor tests were found to be
efficient for this purpose (20). Our results, although involving
a small number of animals, showed a significant correlation
between infarct sizes and neuroscores on D1, and are therefore
in agreement with previous data. Conversely, in ischemic
animals (sham-operated excluded), no correlation was found
between D0 neuroscores and D1 outcome measures, whether
it be infarct sizes (Fig. 3b) or neuroscores. Behavioral assessment
performed during arterial occlusion failed to distinguish
between successfully operated animals, with D1 typical corticostriatal
infarcts, and those with smaller infarcts restricted
to striatal/hypothalamic areas. Moreover, acute behavioral
scores showed no correlation with D0 ADC lesion volumes
(Fig. 4a) or hypoperfusion volumes. Severe deficits were
noted in animals showing large corticostriatal ADC lesions
(>200 mm3), but also in those with subcortical ADC lesions
(13 to 109 mm3); only sham-operated animals showed no
or minor deficits during occlusion. The presence of acute
sensorimotor deficits appears as a necessary but insufficient
inclusion criterion to identify successfully operated animals.
Multiparametric MRI, performed during arterial occlusion,
included DWI, DSC-PWI, and MRA. DWI predicted lesion

size at 24 h (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the presence of a corticostriatal
lesion in DWI appears to be a valid inclusion criterion for
preclinical trials of stroke therapies. With the exception of the
sham-operated controls, all animals showed a notable hypoperfusion
(ipsi-to-contralateral mean ratio<50%, Fig. 4b). This
might account for the severe behavioral deficits, without
major DWI lesion, observed in five animals. A possible interpretation
is that hypoperfusion in such animals may lie just
below the penumbra threshold, delaying the development of
the DWI lesion while still causing symptoms. This hypothesis
remains difficult to confirm in rodents, as it would require
absolute quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, electrophysiological
evaluation, or functional MRI. In addition,
monitoring of reperfusion was not performed in this study.
Although a PWI/DWI mismatch was noted in all animals, the
present study was not designed to assess the MRI thresholds
identifying penumbral tissue. Finally, our simple angiographic
score failed to predict the development of a corticostriatal
infarct. This could result from the lack of quantitative measurement
or from the small number of animals. Therefore,
MRA should not be used as sole inclusion criterion.
The three behavioral scoring scales used in this study (0–3
(13); 0–9 (14); 0–20 (15)) showed similar correlation coefficients
with initial (D0) and final (D1) lesion sizes. The 0–14
scale from Chen et al. (21) includes reflex examination, but is
overall very similar to the 0–9 scale used here. The limbplacing
tests, described by De Ryck et al. (22) and adapted by
Belayev et al. (23) to yield a 0–12 scale, are likely to be inappropriate
during occlusion, as all animals except shamoperated
ones showed contralateral forepaw paresis. ART was
not a conclusive functional task during arterial occlusion, as
all animals failed to remove the adhesives. Other functional
tests (cylinder test, grid-walking test, rotarod) may prove
useful to predict the development of a corticostriatal lesion,
but their use has never been reported during arterial occlusion
, presumably because they require more time for analysis.
Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is increasingly used to
assess adequate occlusion in rodents. It was not included in the
present study so as to avoid any interference of additional
surgery on MRI or behavioral examination. Probes are usually
placed over the parietal cortex of rodents where easily accessible
and relatively flat skull makes attachment easy. But such
site samples a varying mixture of MCA and anterior cerebral
artery territory flows. A wide range of relative regional CBF
thresholds has been reported, depending on the position of
the probe or possible craniotomy/bone thinning (24,25).
Formal validation of LDF against MRA was performed using
the embolic MCAO model, and its limitations in discriminating
between medium and large infarcts have been highlighted
(26). This observation supports a complete characterization of
the developing infarct by MRI, a technique that is more relevant
to clinical translation.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that behavioral examination
of ischemic rats, although highly relevant to measure
recovery at the subacute stage, is not an adequate inclusion
criterion at the acute stage. Indeed, behavioral testing performed during arterial occlusion fails to identify successfully
operated animals. DWI, by allowing a direct evaluation of the
ischemic lesion, was strongly correlated with final functional
status and infarct size. Thus, in neuroprotection studies, acute
DWI could be used to ascertain that pretreatment ischemic
lesion volumes are equal in different groups of animals. Acute
MRI during experimental stroke may therefore reduce selection
bias and enhance the statistical power of preclinical evaluation
of neuroprotective drugs. Further studies, using an
actual treatment protocol, are needed to assess the respective
sensitivity and specificity of the two methods, in comparison
with LDF.
