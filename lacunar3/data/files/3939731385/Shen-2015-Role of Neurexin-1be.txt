As an emergency scenario, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) causes severe cases of rupture of cerebral 
blood vessels in the clinic and produces a high mortality and 
disability rate.1–3 Despite the recent progress in microsurgical 
and endovascular surgical techniques, the outcome of patients 
who suffer a SAH remains unsatisfactory.3,4 Cognitive impairment
is the main obstacle for SAH patients to return to normal 
life.5–8 It is well known that synapses are the basic structural 
and functional units of neurotransmission, which is the mechanism
by which cognitive functions are formed.
As a transmembrane protein, neurexin-1β shows widespread
expression in brain and is present in the presynaptic 
membrane of neurons.9 Previous studies demonstrated that 
the combination of neurexin-1β and postsynaptic membrane 
protein neuroligin-1 plays a central role in the formation of 
synapses in the central nervous system.10 Neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 induce synaptic differentiation and regulate the 
transfer of neurotransmitters between neurons.10 In addition, 
it has been reported that neuroligin-1 mutation lacking bind 
site for neurexin-1β failed to induce synapse formation.11 In 
conclusion, the expression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 
and the interaction between them are closely related to cognitive
function. However, until now, no study has investigated 
the contribution of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1, especially 
Background and Purpose—Neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 play an important role in the formation, maintenance, 
and regulation of synaptic structures. This study is to estimate the potential role of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 in 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cognitive dysfunction.
Methods—In vivo, 228 Sprague–Dawley rats were used. An experimental SAH model was induced by single blood injection 
to prechiasmatic cistern. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxyhemoglobin to mimic SAH in vitro. 
Specific small interfering RNAs and expression plasmids for neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 were exploited both in vivo 
and in vitro. Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, neurological scoring, and Morris water maze were 
performed to evaluate the mechanism of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1, as well as neurological outcome.
Results—Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed SAH-induced decrease in the expressions of neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 and the interaction between neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 in neurons. In addition, the interaction between 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 was reduced by their knockdown and increased by their overexpression. The formation of 
excitatory synapses was inhibited by oxyhemoglobin treatment, which was significantly ameliorated by overexpression 
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and aggravated by the knockdown of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1. More importantly, 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 overexpression ameliorated SAH-induced cognitive dysfunction, whereas neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 knockdown induced an opposite effect.
Conclusions—Enhancing the expressions of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 could promote the interaction between them and 
the formation of excitatory synapses, which is helpful to improve cognitive dysfunction after SAH. Neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 might be good targets for improving cognitive function after SAH. (Stroke. 2015;46:2607-2615. DOI:

the interaction between them, to SAH-induced cognitive 
dysfunction.
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and the effect of interaction 
between neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 on cognitive function 
after SAH and to explore the underlying mechanisms of SAH-
induced cognitive impairment.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Two hundred twenty-eight adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 
between 350 and 400 g were purchased from the Animal Center of 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The animal experimental
protocols, including all use, care, and operative procedures, 
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Soochow 
University and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals by the National Institutes of Health. All animal 
experiments were performed in accordance with Animal Research: 
Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Every effort
was made to minimize the number of animals used and their 
suffering.
Rat SAH Model
Experimental SAH model was induced by single blood injection to 
prechiasmatic cistern as reported previously.12
In this model, the inferior basal temporal lobe of SAH group was 
stained with blood (shown as shadow areas in Figure IA in the onlineonly
Data Supplement).
Experimental Design
The in vivo experiments were divided into 2 parts. In experiment 1, 
54 rats (68 rats were used, but only 54 rats survived after the surgery) 
were randomly assigned to 9 groups of 6 rats each, a sham group, 
and 8 experimental groups arranged by time: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 
hours, 1, and 2 weeks after SAH. At the indicated time point after 
SAH, rats were euthanized, and the cortex and hippocampus tissues 
were separated and taken for analysis (Figure IB in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
In experiment 2, 144 rats (160 rats were used, but only 144 
rats were survived) were randomly divided into 9 groups: SAH 
group, SAH+scramble small interfering RNA (siRNA) group, 
SAH+neurexin-1β siRNA group, SAH+neuroligin-1 siRNA group, 
SAH+neurexin-1β siRNA+neuroligin-1 siRNA group, SAH+empty 
vector group, SAH+neurexin-1β plasmid group, SAH+neuroligin-1 
plasmid group, and SAH+neurexin-1β plasmid+neuroligin-1 plasmid
group (n=16 for each group). After the indicated treatments, rats 
were euthanized, the cortex and hippocampus tissues were separated 
and taken for analysis, and Morris water maze task was performed to 
evaluate the cognitive changes of the experimental rats (Figure IC in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
In vitro, primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 20 
µmol/L oxyhemoglobin to mimic the effect of SAH shown in Figure 
ID in the online-only Data Supplement.

was determined by Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) posttest
, and P<0.05 was considered to be a significant difference.
Results
SAH-Induced Decrease in the Expressions of 
Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 and the Interaction 
Between Them in Rat Brain
The results of Western blot demonstrated that when compared with 
the sham group, the expressions of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 
in the brain were reduced significantly from 3 hours after SAH, 
reached the lowest point at 72 hours, and then rebounded gradually
, and the expressions were similar to that in the sham group 
at 1 and 2 weeks (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence assay further
verified the SAH-induced decrease in the expressions of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 in cortical and hippocampal neurons
(Figure 1B and 1C), which is described in detail in Figures 
II and III in the online-only Data Supplement. In addition, SAH 
also decreased the interaction between neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1
at 72 hours after SAH (Figure 1D).

Shen et al Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 Downregulation in SAH 2611
Effects of Knockdown and Overexpression of 
Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 on the Interaction 
Between Them and on Brain Cell Death in SAH 
Rats
Western blot assay showed that the protein levels of neurexin-
1β and neuroligin-1 were significantly decreased by siRNA 
transfection and increased by plasmid transfection (Figure 2A). 
The interaction between neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 was 
also significantly decreased by the knockdown of neurexin-
1β and neuroligin-1 and increased by the overexpression of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 (Figure 2B). In addition, TUNEL 
staining showed that neither the knockdown nor the overexpression
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 could affect cell death 
induced by SAH (Figure 2C; Figure IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Oxyhemoglobin-Induced Decrease in the Expression 
of Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 and the Interaction 
Between Them
Consistent with the in vivo data, Western blot and immunoprecipitation
assay showed that both the protein levels of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and the interaction between 
them were significantly decreased by oxyhemoglobin treatment
(Figure 3).
Effects of Knockdown and Overexpression of 
Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 on the Interaction 
Between Them and on Cell Death in Cultured 
Neurons
The efficiency of siRNA-mediated knockdown, as well as 
expression plasmid-mediated overexpression of neurexin-
1β and neuroligin-1, in cultured hippocampal neurons was 
also verified by Western blot (Figure 4A). Consistently, 
the interaction between neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 
was also significantly decreased by the knockdown of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and increased by the overexpression
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 (Figure 4B). 
In addition, TUNEL staining showed that neither the 
knockdown nor the overexpression of neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 could affect oxyhemoglobin-induced neuron 
apoptosis. (Figure 4C; Figure V in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Critical Role of Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 in 
the Formation of Excitatory Synapses in Cultured 
Hippocampal Neurons Under Oxyhemoglobin 
Treatment
We next observed the effects of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 
knockdown or overexpression on the number of excitatory 
synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons under oxyhemoglobin
treatment (Figure 5). The results showed oxyhemoglobin-induced
decrease in the number of excitatory synapses, as 
defined by synapsin (a presynaptic marker)-positive postsynaptic
density protein 95 clusters, which was aggravated by the 
knockdown of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and ameliorated 
by the overexpression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1. The 
results also showed that there were no significant differences 
between neurexin-1β siRNA+neuroligin-1 siRNA group and 
neurexin-1β siRNA group or neuroligin-1 siRNA group, 
whereas there were significant differences between neurexin-
1β plasmid+neuroligin-1 plasmid group and neurexin-1β
plasmid group or neuroligin-1 plasmid group.
Effects of Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 on SAHInduced
Behavioral and Cognitive Dysfunction in 
Rats
SAH-induced neurological behavior impairment and whether 
knockdown or overexpression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 
affects impairment were tested (Figure 6A). Compared with 
the sham group, neurological score in the SAH group was significantly
higher, suggesting a remarkable neurological defect 
induced by SAH. Scramble siRNA and empty vector treatment
did not affect neurological outcome. Neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 when silenced either individually or simultaneously
could significantly aggravate SAH-induced neurological 
defect. Given the overexpression of neurexin-1β or neuroligin-1
, the neurological behavior impairment was significantly 
reversed, whereas the overexpression of both neurexin-1β and 
neuroligin-1 simultaneously had a greater effect than the overexpression
of neurexin-1β or neuroligin-1 individually.

The water maze performance demonstrated no difference
in swimming speed between the experimental groups, 
which suggested that motor abilities did not grossly differ
between the groups (data not shown). Rats from the 
SAH group showed longer latency and swim path length 
when compared with sham group, whereas no significant 
differences were observed between the SAH group and 
SAH+scramble siRNA group or SAH+empty vector group. 
In addition, SAH-induced increase in latency and swim path 
length was significantly ameliorated by the overexpression 
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and aggravated by the 
silencing of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1. And, the overexpression
of both genes simultaneously had more significant 
effect than the overexpression of the 2 genes individually 
(Figure 6B–6D; Figures VI–VIII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Discussion
In this study, we found that there was no rescue of cells by 
the overexpression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 in SAH-
induced brain cell death. However, the overexpression of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 could increase the interaction 
between them and the formation of excitatory synapses and 
improve SAH-induced cognitive dysfunction, whereas knockdown
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 led to the opposite 
effect. In addition, on the formation of excitatory synapses 
of neurons and the cognitive changes of the experimental 
rats, silencing neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 individually or

Shen et al Neurexin-1β and Neuroligin-1 Downregulation in SAH 2613
simultaneously exerts similar effects, whereas the overexpression
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 simultaneously exerts 
a more powerful effect than the overexpression of neurexin-
1β and neuroligin-1 individually. These results suggested 
that neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 worked cooperatively and 
played a critical role in the formation of excitatory synapses 
under SAH condition. Neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 might 
be potential targets for improving SAH-induced cognitive 
dysfunction.
To our surprise, crystal structures of neuroligin-1 in isolation
and in complex with neurexin-1β have been identified, 
which will help us to relate neurexin-1β/neuroligin-1 complex 
structure to function at the synapse and will provide molecular
insights for understanding how to regulate the interaction 
between them.20,21 In addition, there are commercial fulllength
protein and protein fragment of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1
(such as Abcam products: ab160463, ab132182, and 
ab161450). Based on these researches, new medicines targeting
neurexin-1β/neuroligin-1 complex or protein therapy will 
become available to patients.
Neuronal damage plays a major role in the pathogenesis of 
early brain injury after SAH. We hypothesized that, synapses, 
which are the key structures for transmitting information 
in neurons, were also damaged after SAH. Therefore, we 
focused our attention on changes in neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1
in the brain tissues of rats in a model of experimental
SAH. The expression of both proteins in the brain cortex 
and hippocampus was reduced obviously as expected, as 
determined by Western blot. This suggests that the synaptic
structure in hippocampal neurons might also be affected 
after SAH. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in cognitive
function; thus, we speculate that the downregulation of 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 affects cognitive function. The 
results of Morris water maze experiments are consistent with 
this hypothesis. The current in vitro experiments also suggested
that excitatory synapses were reduced significantly in 
oxyhemoglobin-treated hippocampal neurons. However, the 
overexpression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 increased the 
number of excitatory synapses compared with the oxyhemoglobin-treated
group. This suggested that the overexpression 
of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 might reverse cognitive dysfunction
after SAH, although this should be clarified in future 
studies.
The current study has some limitations. In vitro experiments 
showed that oxyhemoglobin maybe an incentive for the decrease 
in the expressions of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1. However,

2614 Stroke September 2015
because of the lack of studies of the other contents of hematoma, 
this study cannot infer the mechanism underlying SAH-induced 
decrease in the expressions of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1. 
In addition, whether SAH-induced decrease in the expressions 
leads to SAH-induced decrease in the interaction between 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 is also not answered in this study.
Summary
This study demonstrated for the first time that decrease in 
the expressions of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 and in the 
interaction between them occurred after SAH in brain tissues, 
and extraneous overexpression of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1
improved cognitive function. Neurexin-1β/neuroligin-1 
might be a promising treatment target for cognitive dysfunction
after SAH.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL.
Role of neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 in cognitive dysfunction after subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in rats
Supplemental Methods
Rat SAH model
After intraperitoneal anesthesia using chloral hydrate (36mg/100g body weight), the heads of
rats were fastened in a stereotactic frame with the mouthpiece at 0°. The body temperature of 
the animals was maintained at 37.5±0.5°C using an automatic heating pad. The tail artery was 
cannulated to gauge mean arterial blood pressure and to gain blood samples. The animals 
were placed in a stereotaxic frame with the mouthpiece at 0°. A laser Doppler flowmeter was 
used to monitor the cerebral blood flow supplied by the middle cerebral artery in the area of 
the cerebral cortex constantly. To place the LDF probes, a bur hole was bored 5-mm left 
lateral and 1-mm posterior to the bregma without injuring to the dura mater.
Then, experimental SAH model was induced by single blood injection to prechiasmatic 
cistern as reported previously 1. Briefly, a total of 0.3 ml of non-heparinized fresh autologous 
arterial blood from femoral artery was injected evenly into the prechiasmatic cistern over 20 s 
using a syringe pump under aseptic conditions. Sham animals were injected in the same 
manner with 0.3 ml saline. The animals were allowed to recover for 45 min after the 
operation. After the operation, 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl was injected subcutaneously to prevent 
dehydration. It was here observed that the inferior basal temporal lobe of SAH group was
stained with blood (shown as shadow areas in Figure IA).
Transfection of si RNA in Rat Brain
According to the manufacturer’s instructions for Entranster-in vivo RNA transfection reagent 
(Engreen, 18668-11-1), the transfection complex of siRNA was prepared as follows. Briefly, 
500 pmol neurexin-1β siRNA, 500 pmol neuroligin-1 siRNA, 500 pmol neurexin-1β siRNA 
and 500 pmol neuroligin-1 siRNA, and 500 pmol scramble siRNA were respectively 
dissolved in 5 μL RNase-free water. Then, 10 μL Entranster-in vivo RNA transfection 
reagent was added to 5 μL siRNA or 5 μL scramble siRNA immediately. The solution was 
mixed for 15 minutes at room temperature. Finally, 15 μL Entranster-in vivo–siRNA mixture 
was injected intracerebroventricularly 48 h before SAH.
Plasmid transfection in Rat Brain
In vivo plasmid transfection in rat brain wasperformed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions for Entranster-in vivo DNA transfection reagent (Engreen, 18668-11-2). Briefly, 
5 μg neurexin-1β plasmid, 5 μg neuroligin-1 plasmid, 5 μg neurexin-1β plasmid and 5 μg
neuroligin-1 plasmid, and 5 μg empty vector were respectively dissolved in 5 μL 
endotoxin-free water. Then, 10 μL Entranster-in vivo DNA transfection reagent was added to 
5 μL plasmid or 5 μL empty vector immediately. The solution was mixed for 15 minutes at 
room temperature. Finally, 15 μL Entranster-in vivo–plasmid mixture was injected 
intracerebroventricularly 48 h before SAH.
Cell cultures
Briefly, hippocampus pairs were isolated from SD rats at 18 days of gestation, and treated 
with papain (100 mg/ml, Worthington, USA) for 10 min at 37°C. Dissociated neurons were 
plated at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 onto plates (Corning, USA) precoated with 0.1 mg/ml 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.1027596698)

poly-D-lysine (Sigma, USA), cultured in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 2% B-27 
and 0.5 mM GlutaMAX™-I (all from Invitrogen , Grand Island, NY), and maintained at 
37°C under humidified conditions and 5% CO2 for 14–19 days. Half of the media were 
exchanged for fresh media every three days.
Transfection of si RNA and plasmid in cultured neurons
Both si RNA transfection and plasmid transfection in cultured neurons were performed using 
Lipofectamine® 3000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen , Grand Island, NY) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were transfected with scramble siRNA, neurexin-1β 
siRNA, neuroligin-1 siRNA, neurexin-1β siRNA + neuroligin-1 siRNA, empty vector, 
neurexin-1β plasmid, neuroligin-1 plasmid, neurexin-1β plasmid + neuroligin-1 plasmid, 
respectively. Twenty-four hours after tranfection, the cells were stimulated with 20 μmol/L 
oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) for an additional 24 h. After the indicated treatments, cells were 
harvest for further analysis.
Western blot 
The frozen samples or cells were lysed mechanically in lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L 
Tris (pH 7.6), 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl 
fluoride, and 0.11 IU/ml aprotinin (all from Sigma–Aldrich, USA). The lysates were 
centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 min at 4°C, and the concentration was measured by the 
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using enhanced BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China). 
The samples were separated using 10 % SDS–PAGE and electrotransferred onto 
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5 % non-fat 
milk for 1 h at room temperature, and were then incubated with primary antibodies against 
neurexin-1β and neuroligin-1 (Santa cruz, USA) in 5% BSA (in TBS+0.1%Tween 20) 
overnight at 4°C. The GAPDH or β-actin (Santa cruz, USA) was used as a loading control. 
The membranes were washed three times for 5 min each in TBS+0.1%Tween 20, and were 
then incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Santa cruz, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the protein bands were 
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The relative quantity of proteins was 
analyzed using Image J and normalized to that of loading controls.
Immunoprecipitation analysis
Firstly, the brain samples were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China). For 
immunoprecipitation, the lysate was incubated with specific antibodies or rabbit IgG 
(negative control) overnight at 4°C with agitation. Protein A+G Sepharose beads were then 
added to each immune complex and the lysate-bead mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4°C 
with rotary agitation. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were then performed for further 
protein separation and detection.
Immunofluorescence analysis
The brain samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 μm 
sections, and examined by immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, sections were stained with 
primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies as described 2. Normal rabbit IgG 
was used as a negative control for immunofluorescence assay (data not shown). Finally, 
sections were observed by a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50/BX-FLA/DP70; 
Olympus Co., Japan). At least three random sections from each rat were examined. The 
relative fluorescence intensity was analyzed by use of Image J program.

Neurological scoring
At 72 h after SAH, all the rats involved in part 2 of in vivo experiment were examined for 
behavioral impairment using a previously published scoring system and monitored for 
appetite, activity, and neurological defects (Table I). 
Morris water maze
Briefly, rats were trained in the Morris water maze on days 3 to 6 postsurgery (4 trials per 
day). The tank had an altitude of 50 cm, a diameter of 180 cm, and was filled with 20°C to 
22°C water to a height of 30 cm. The platform was placed 2 cm beneath the surface of the 
water. Starting points were changed everyday. Each trial lasted either until the rat found the 
platform or for 90 seconds. After each trial, rats were allowed to rest for 20 seconds on the 
platform. Swimming speed, latency and swim path length were recorded.
