Amyloid- (A) deposition in the cerebral vasculature is accompanied by remodeling which has a profound influence on vascular
integrity and function. In the current study we have quantitatively assessed the age-dependent changes of the cortical vasculature in the
arcA model of cerebral amyloidosis. To estimate the density of the cortical microvasculature in vivo, we used contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance microangiography (CE-MRA). Three-dimensional gradient echo datasets with 60m isotropic resolution were
acquired in 4- and 24-month-old arcAmice and compared with wild-type (wt) control mice of the same age before and after administration
of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. After segmentation of the cortical vasculature from difference images, an automated
algorithm was applied for assessing the number and size distribution of intracortical vessels. With CE-MRA, cerebral arteries
and veins with a diameter of less than the nominal pixel resolution (60m) can be visualized. A significant age-dependent reduction in
the number of functional intracortical microvessels (radii of 20–80m) has been observed in 24-month-old arcAmice compared with
age-matched wt mice, whereas there was no difference between transgenic and wt mice of 4 months of age. Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated strong fibrinogen and Adeposition in small- and medium-sized vessels, but not in large cerebral arteries, of 24-monthold
arcAmice. The reduced density of transcortical vessels may thus be attributed to impaired perfusion and vascular occlusion caused
by deposition of Aand fibrin. The study demonstrated that remodeling of the cerebrovasculature can be monitored noninvasively with
CE-MRA in mice.
Introduction
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from the failure to
eliminate amyloid- (A) and other amyloid peptides from the
cerebral vasculature in aged people and patients with Alzheimer‘s
disease (AD; Glenner et al., 1981; Weller et al., 2008, 2009). A
accumulates predominantly in cerebral microvessels such as capillaries
and arterioles (Fischer at al., 1990; Buee et al., 1994; Miao
et al., 2005; Kouznetsova et al., 2006) where it leads to an impeded
cerebral blood supply, reduced vascular reactivity, and increased
susceptibility to cerebral ischemia (Gilbert and Vinters, 1983;
Cadavid et al., 2000; Haglund et al., 2006; Ryu and McLarnon,
2009). These changes in hemodynamic conditions result in longterm
structural changes known as vascular remodeling. Blood
vessels become tortuous, the composition of the basement membrane
is altered (de la Torre, 1997; Moody et al., 1997), and the
overall vascular density decreases (Lee et al., 2005; Bouras et al.,
2006). Furthermore, changes in the proteolytic microenvironment
lead to impairment of blood–brain-barrier (BBB) integrity
and the occurrence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and intracerebral
hemorrhage (Gilbert and Vinters, 1983; Franceschi et al.,
1995; Ryu and McLarnon, 2009). There is increasing evidence
that vascular remodeling might not only reflect an adaptive process
, but also constitutes an important mechanism in the pathophysiology
of AD and CAA (Weller et al., 2009; Marchesi, 2011).
Cerebrovascular A deposition can be mimicked in mouse
models, which, therefore, have become central for studying the
pathophysiology of CAA and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches
(Calhoun et al., 1999; Herzig et al., 2004; Miao et al.,
2005; Kouznetsova et al., 2006). Recently, the arcA mouse line
has been generated, which shows age-dependent cerebrovascular
dysfunction as reflected by BBB impairment, neurovascular uncoupling
(Merlini et al., 2011), decreased vascular reactivity
(Princz-Kranz et al., 2010), and the occurrence of cerebral mi-

crobleeds (Klohs et al., 2011; Merlini et al., 2011). Based on these
findings, we hypothesized that the arcAmice would show CAA-
related remodeling of the cerebral microvasculature. We used
high-resolution contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography
(CE-MRA) in 4- and 24-month-old arcAmice and agematched
wild-type (wt) control mice to assess age-dependent
changes in the cerebral vasculature. Aged arcAmice exhibited a
significant reduction in density of functional intracortical microvessels
with radii in the range of 20–80m, while large cerebral vessels,
as detected with conventional time-of-flight MRA (TOF-MRA),
werenotaffected.Thisinvivoobservationisinlinewithresultsofthe
immunohistochemistry revealing that A and fibrinogen are predominantly
deposited in small- and medium-sized vessels, but spare
larger cerebral vessels. Hence, the reduced density of intracortical
vessels observed in advanced disease may be attributed to obstruction
of perfusion as a result of abnormal fibrinolysis. In murine
models of cerebral amyloidosis, the remodeling of these vascular
structures can be monitored noninvasively with CE-MRA.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss
Federal Act on Animal Protection. We used arcA transgenic mice of
either sex, which express the human APP 695 containing both the Swedish
and the Arctic mutation under the control of the prion protein promoter
as described previously (Knobloch et al., 2007). Age- and gendermatched
wt littermates served as controls. Mice at the age of 4 months
(arcA,n4; wt,n4) and 24 months (arcA,n6; wt,n5) were
used for the study. Animals were kept at standard housing conditions
(temperature, 20–24°C; relative humidity, minimum 40%; light/dark
cycle, 12 h) providing water and foodad libitum.
Magnetic resonance imaging.Experiments were performed on a Bruker
BioSpec 94/30 (Bruker BioSpin) small animal MR system operating at
400 MHz with a gradient system, capable of a maximum gradient
strength of 400 mT/m with an 80s rise time. A cryogenic quadrature RF
surface coil (Bruker BioSpin) was used for RF signal transmission and
reception (Baltes et al., 2009). Anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane
(Abbott) in a 4:1 air/oxygen mixture and maintained with 1.2% isoflurane.
Mice were endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated
with 90 breaths/min, applying a respiration cycle of 25% inhalation and
75% exhalation (MRI-1 Volume Ventilator, CWI). Temperature was
kept at 36.0  0.5°C using a warm-water circuit integrated into the
animal support (Bruker BioSpin). Body temperature was monitored
with a rectal temperature probe (MLT415, ADInstruments). The tail
veins of the mice were cannulated for administration of contrast agents.
Tri-pilot scans were used for accurate positioning of the animal head
inside the magnet. For high-resolution structural imaging, we used a 2D

to 0.52 mg of Fe; Endorem, Guerbet) as a bolus into the tail
vein.Thepostcontrastimageacquisitionwasstarted1minaftertheinjection
of the contrast agent. The acquisition time was 36 min for each scan.
Determination of contrast-to-noise ratios. Regions of interest (ROIs)
were drawn in vessels and adjacent tissue of precontrast images. A noise
ROI was placed outside the head of the animal. Signal-to-noise (SNR)
ratios were calculated by dividing the signal intensity of the vessel ROI by
the SD of the noise ROI. SNR values were calculated for four regions
separately and then averaged.
Reconstruction of angiograms. For TOF-MRA datasets, angiograms
were generated by maximum intensity projections (MIPs) using Paravision
5.0 (Bruker BioSpin MRI). All angiograms were evaluated by investigators
blinded to the genotype of the mouse. MIPs of TOF-MRA were
inspected from various projection angles. Flow voids were detected when
the signal intensities in an identified blood vessel reached background
level. Distality was counted by assessing the number of visible branches of
the anterior cerebral artery (Fig. 1C,D). Distality count, i.e., the number
of hierarchical levels of vascular branches detected, was only estimated
for MIPs of TOF-MRA data, because for CE-MRA the whole vessel tree
was not covered in the acquisition.
For CE-MRA, difference images were first obtained by subtraction of
the postcontrast image from the precontrast image before MIP generation
using home-written software based on IDL (Interactive Data Language
, version 6.4; ITT Visual Information Solutions).
Assessment of vessel number and vessel radius.For segmentation of the
cerebral cortex, ROIs were drawn for each animal on each 61-m-thick

slice of the 3D dataset. The ROIs were chosen to encompass both hemispheres
of the neocortex over a depth of 430m. To exclude meningeal
vasculature, superficial brain slices to a depth of 350m below the brain
surface were not considered in the ROI analysis. A noise ROI was placed
outside the brain. The selected ROIs were combined to define a volume
of interest (VOI) required for the subsequent 3D vessel analysis. In this
algorithm, vessel structures were identified according to the following
two threshold criteria: A voxel was considered to belong to a vessel, if (1)
the signal of the voxel was higher than the signal threshold (S
Threshold
)as
defined in Equation 1, and (2) the number of connected voxels was equal
to or higher than the connectivity threshold. S

For voxels fulfilling this threshold criterion, a 3D search algorithm was
applied searching for voxels connected along edges or corners. Structures
for which the number of connected voxels exceeded the connectivity
threshold set to 3, 6, and 9 were considered as vessels.
The intensity of a vascular signal depends on the relative voxel volume
taken by the vascular compartment. Correspondingly, evaluation of
these partial volume effects allowed estimating the compartment size and
thus an upper limit for the vessel dimensions. For this purpose we assumed
a perpendicular orientation of the vessel with respect to the imaging
slices. For transcortical vessels oriented radially with regard to the
cortical surface, this approximation appears reasonable. Within each
slice the voxel with the highest signal intensity S

images was assumed to comprise only the vascular compartment. Accordingly

Immunohistochemistry.All animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal

and perfused transcardially with PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie). Brains were then embedded
in paraffin and cut into 10-m-thick horizontal sections. The sections
were pretreated in 85°C Na-Citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.5, in the microwave
), followed by a 5 min submersion in 95% formic acid. Blocking of

orescence staining was visualized using sequential acquisition of each
channel. The pinhole aperture was set to 1.0 Airy unit for each channel.
Stacks of consecutive optical sections (6; 512512 pixels, spaced 0.5m
inz) were acquired. For visual display,Z-sections of both channels were
projected in thez-dimension (maximal intensity), and merged using the
image analysis software Imaris (Bitplane). Cropping of images and adjustments
of brightness and contrast were identical for each labeling and
done using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems).
Quantitative analyses of the vWF-immunoreactivity associated with
the endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature were done on three
different horizontal brain sections obtained from 5 mice per age and
genotype. Two digital images per brain hemisphere were acquired using
a40(NA1.3) objective. The area covered by the immunoreactive signal
was quantified using a threshold algorithm of ImageJ software. The binary
images were segmented and the individual vessels outlined. The
corresponding masks were analyzed with regard to the total area covered
by the anti-vWF immunoreactivity. The different measures were averaged
per animal and included in the statistical analysis.
For the quantitative evaluation of the fibrinogen accumulation and
colocalization with thioflavin S associated with vascular plaques, three
different brain sections per animal (n 5 per age and genotype) were
included. For each hemisphere, one digital tile-scan (1.00.76 mm) was
acquired using a 20Apochromate objective (Zeiss, NA 0.75). First, red
and green channels were individually segmented and then analyzed with
regard to pixel overlap within outlined vessels using a colocalization
plug-in of ImageJ (NIH). The diameter of the vessels showing colocalized
thioflavin S/fibrinogen immunoreactivity was recorded and the cumulative
distribution and frequency calculated as a function of their size.
Statistical analysis.Data are presented as meanSD. Student’sttest,
1-way ANOVA, or repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test
(SigmaStat 3.0, Systat Software) were used for statistical comparison,
where appropriate. The statistical significance level was set top0.05.
Results
Assessment of vessel status with angiograms
To evaluate the effect of Adeposition on major cerebral arteries,
3D TOF angiograms have been recorded in wt and arcAmice at
4 months (n 4 each) and 24 months (n 6 each) of age. In
TOF-MRA the signal arises from fully magnetized blood that has
entered the imaging volume and reached the respective vascular
voxel in a defined time interval (flow encoding time), without the
need of administering a contrast agent (Reese et al., 1999). MIPs
displayed in different orientations allow clear identification of
major intracranial arteries as illustrated for a 24-month-old wt
and arcA mouse (Fig. 1A,B). No apparent flow abnormalities
could be detected in the vessels of wt control and arcA mice at
both ages. The distality count did not reveal any trait-specific
difference at either age, yielding values of 4.20.4 and 4.20.4
for 4-month-old wt and arcAmice and 3.50.4 and 3.50.5
for 24-month-old wt and arcA mice, respectively. The distality
value tended to be slightly lower in aged animals, though the
difference was not significant (Fig. 1C,D). Interestingly, flow
voids were detected in extracranial vessels such as the pterygopalatine
arteries of wt and arcA mice at both ages (for 24 months,
Fig. 1A,B, white arrows). Again, no difference was observed between
wt and arcAmice.
Visualization of vascular structures can be enhanced using
intravascular contrast agents such as iron oxide nanoparticles,
which, due to their large net positive magnetic moments, induce
spin dephasing resulting in a net signal loss (Boxerman et al.,
1995; Bolan et al., 2006). Figure 2 displays representative horizontal
images of the brain of a 24-month-old wt control and
an arcA mouse. Following the administration of Endorem,
transcortical blood vessels became visible as focal signal voids
that could not be discerned on the precontrast image (Fig. 2B,E)
and could be enhanced in difference images, as nonvascular brain
structures were canceling out (Fig. 2C,F). We noticed remarkable
variations in the signal intensity of the vascular structures in the
difference images. This is attributed to partial volume effects.
This intensity information can, in turn, be used to estimate the
size of the vascular compartment within a voxel, from which a
maximum vessel diameter might be deduced (assuming that the
vascular compartment is due to a single vessel crossing the voxel).
Several large circular hypointensities (mean diameter of 242.5
108.1 m) have been observed in the brains of 24-month-old
arcA mice already before the administration of the contrast
agent (Fig. 2D, white arrow). Such structures have not been observed
in the brains of 4-month-old arcA mice and 4- and 24-
month-old wt control mice and represent most likely either large

between arcA mice and wt controls at 4 months of age (mean SD; *p 0.05, repeatedmeasures
ANOVA and Tukey‘s test). There was no significant difference between the number of
vessels in each category among the four groups tested.

iron-containing A plaques (Benveniste et al., 1999) or cerebral
microbleeds (Klohs et al., 2011). These structures disappear in
the difference images, because they are not affected by the administration
of the intravascular contrast agent (Fig. 2F). In addition,
in all animals few foci of reduced signal intensity have been detected
in the precontrast images. These are attributed to venous
structures for which the relatively high concentration of paramagnetic
deoxyhemoglobin leads to decreased blood T

* values
already in the absence of an exogenous contrast agent (Ogawa et
al., 1990; Reichenbach et al., 1997).
For illustration purposes, 3D stacks of difference images have
been constructed for computing of MIPs (Fig. 3). Clearly, these
MIPs provide significantly more detail about the vascular anatomy
than those obtained from TOF angiograms, which essentially
reveal only large arterial structures. While CE-MIPs are
dominated by large vessels running at the brain surface, such as
the transverse and superior sagittal sinus, many transcortical vessels
become apparent (Fig. 3A,B). These can be highlighted by
visualizing a cortical subcube of the full 3D dataset (Fig. 3C–E).
CE-MRA reveals age-dependent decrease in transcortical
vessels
An algorithm was developed which assumes that blood vessels
form a continuous tree structure. Structures that exceeded a userdefined
intensity threshold in the 3D dataset derived from difference
images were counted as vessels provided they fulfilled the
connectivity criterion, which states that the vessel can be observed
over multiple slices within the 3D dataset. The strength of
this criterion could be adjusted. The number of vessels was estimated
for different values of vessel connectivity i.e., 3, 6, and 9
pixels, corresponding to minimal length of a vessel segment of
183, 366, and 546m respectively. Using this algorithm, individual
datasets have been analyzed in a semiautomated fashion. The
quantitative results on vessel counts are illustrated in Figure 4.
We did not observe any difference in vessel count in 4-month-old
wt and arcA mice (Fig. 4A). However, there was a significant
reduction in the number of transcortical vessels in 24-month-old
transgenic compared with wt animals in a volume of11 mm3
(*p 0.05). Vessels were categorized according to their vessel
radius as estimated based on its signal intensity, which is governed
by the fractional volume of the vascular compartment (Fig.
4B). There were no significant differences between the numbers
of vessels in each category among the four groups, though the
mean number of small (20–40m) and medium sized (40–60
m) cortical vessels in the group of 24-month-old arcA mice
tended to be smaller than in the respective group of wt animals.
Abnormal fibrinolysis in small- and medium-sized thioflavin
S-positive vessels
Immunohistochemical assessment of vascular density, A and
fibrinogen accumulation was performed on brain sections of
4- and 24-month-old wt and arcAmice. Confocal analysis identified
endothelial cells (Fig. 5A–C). Additional vWF immunoreactivity
was revealed in thrombus-like structures in microvessels
of 24-month-old arcAmice only (Fig. 5C, white arrow). Quantitative
analysis of vWF immunoreactivity demonstrated no differences
between the four groups investigated.
Thioflavin S-positive Aaccumulation was apparent in cerebral
vessels in sections of 24-month-old arcAmice (Fig. 5C), but
was observed neither in sections of age-matched wt controls (Fig.
5B) nor in 4-month-old transgenic (Fig. 6A) and wt mice (data
not shown). Investigation of different anatomical regions revealed
a high abundance of thioflavin S-positive vessels in cortical
areas of 24-month-old arcAmice, while vessels in the thalamus
showed almost no Adeposition (results not shown). Autofluorescence
of pigment granules were observed in 24-month-old wt

no difference in vWF immunoreactivity between arcAand wt controls at 4 months of age and between arcAand wt controls at 24 months of age (D; meanSD; ttest). Scale bar: 10m.

Fibrinogen accumulation was observed in vessels of 24-
month-old arcA mice (Fig. 6C). The fibrinogen accumulation
was always colocalized by thioflavin S-positive signal (Fig. 6G).
thioflavin S/fibrinogen-immunoreactivity clearly differed between
vessel categories. In small- and medium-sized arteries,
thioflavin S/fibrinogen-positive signal was highly abundant,
whereas in larger vessels it was scarcely visible (Fig. 6D–F). Some
of the small vessels were filled by the fibrinogen deposition, indicating
vessel stenosis (Fig. 6D). Quantitative assessment of immunoreactivity
showed highest thioflavin S/fibrinogen-positive
signal in vessels with a diameter between 20 and 40m (Fig. 6H).
Discussion
Apart from the formation of parenchymal plaques, cerebral amyloidosis
also involves deposition of Apeptides at vessels, which
may lead to vascular remodeling as well as compromised function
of the cerebrovasculature. In the arcAtransgenic mouse model,
age-dependent aberrations in the structure and function of the
cerebrovasculature have been reported (Princz-Kranz et al.,
2010; Klohs et al., 2011; Merlini et al., 2011). We used MRA
techniques to noninvasively assess cerebral vasculature. While
TOF-MRA did not display any pathological changes, CE-MRA
revealed a reduction in the density of the microvasculature in the
arcAmouse during advanced disease state.
TOF-MRA and CE-MRA can be used to assess different levels
of the vascular tree. In TOF-MRA the signal depends on the
blood flow (Lin et al., 1997), confining the method to the visualization
of large cerebral arteries with high blood-flow rates. Highresolution
TOF-MRA has been applied to transgenic mouse
models of AD and CAA, reporting prominent flow voids in the
major arteries of aged APP overexpressing transgenic animals
(Beckmann et al., 2003; Krucker et al., 2004; Thal et al., 2009; El
Tannir El Tayara et al., 2010). In contrast, we did not detect flow
voids in arcAmice. This is not surprising, because immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that A and fibrinogen deposition
prevails in small- and medium-sized cerebral vessels, but effectively
spares larger cerebral vessels. There was a trend toward a

arcAmouse brain sections (C–F) after thioflavin S staining (green) and antifibrinogen immunohistochemistry (red). The white arrows point to autofluorescence caused by lipofuscin aggregates,
which are typical findings in neurons of aged animals. Fibrinogen accumulation was seen only in thioflavin S-positive vessels in 24-month-old arcA mice. Fibrinogen accumulation colocalized
strongly with Adeposition (G; meanSD; *p0.05 Student’sttest). Deposition of Aand fibrinogen were confined to small- and medium-sized arteries and were only scarcely visible in large
vessels (D–F). The histogram depicts the cumulative frequency of the thioflavin S/fibrinogen immunoreactivity according to different categories of vessel diameter (H). Scale bars:A–C,10m;
D–F,30m.

reduced distality count in TOF MRI of 24-month-old compared
with 4-month-old mice, indicating a reduced blood flow in the older
animals. El Tannir El Tayara et al. (2010) observed a reduction in the
length of middle cerebral arteries both in aged APP/PS1 and wt control
mice. This effect can be attributed to a decline in blood flow
velocity due to aging (Vriens et al., 1989; Portman et al., 1992).
An intriguing finding in earlier TOF-MRA studies (Beckmann
et al., 2003; Krucker et al., 2004; Thal et al., 2009; El Tannir El
Tayara et al., 2010) was the observation of flow voids in extracranial
vessels, such as the pterygopalatine artery, in APP overexpressing
mice. As the transgene is expressed under the control of
the Thy-1 promoter, Adeposition should be confined to intracerebral
vessels. In the current study we observed similar flow
voids, however, both in arcA and wt mice of both age groups.
This finding is consistent with earlier reports in APP/PS1 and
age-matched wt mice (El Tannir El Tayara et al., 2010) and indicates
that the flow voids observed are neither linked to the A
pathology nor the genetic trait. Instead, their occurrence might
be attributed to susceptibility effects caused by the proximity of
the tympanic bulba to the petrygopalatine artery (El Tannir El
Tayara et al., 2010). Hence, in TOF-MRA the detectability of a
vessel may be compromised either by reduced blood flow rates
(Lin et al., 1997) or by local flow disturbances (Underwood and
Mohiaddin, 1993). The technique appears of limited value for
studying vascular remodeling in mouse models of CAA that affect
medium-sized to small vessels characterized by low flow rates and
potential abnormalities in flow pattern.
Therefore, we exploited the use of CE-MRA, which is independent
of blood flow rates (Haacke et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1997;
Bolan et al., 2006). As contrast agent we intravenously injected
Endorem, which has a biphasic clearance kinetic (Majumdar et
al., 1990). Approximately 56% of the injected dose was estimated
to remain in the blood pool until the end of the postcontrast acquisition.
Hence, contrast-agent filled blood vessels (both arteries and
veins) could be clearly distinguished from stationary tissue.
By using CE-MRA, blood vessels smaller than the nominal
image resolution can be detected, because the area affected by
extravascular dephasing caused by the susceptibility difference
between vessel and stationary tissue exceeds the vessel dimensions
(Ogawa and Lee, 1990). Thus, significant changes in signal
can be observed even when the vascular compartment comprises
only a fraction of the voxel volume. We have used an algorithm
that counted the vessels in the differences images when they fulfilled
the criteria of Eq. 1. With this method, we found a significantly
reduced number of intracortical vessels (radii of 20–80
m) in a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis, indicating that
noninvasive CE-MRA is sensitive in detecting vascular pathology
affecting the microvasculature. Yet, the resolution of the
method is not sufficient in resolving the status of capillaries with
a diameter of7–10 m. Information about capillary density
may be inferred using stochastic approaches such as vessel size
imaging (Tropre `s et al., 2001).
Semiautomated analysis of CE-MRA datasets revealed a significant
reduction in the number of intracortical vessels in 24-
month-old arcAcompared with aged-matched wt control mice,
whereas there was no difference between transgenic and wt mice
of 4 month of age. For verification of these findings, we investigated
the density of intracortical vessels in corresponding brain
section stained against the endothelial marker vWF. We observed
no differences in expression levels of vWF among all groups,
indicating that intracortical vessels in the 24-month-old arcA
mice have not been lost. However, as the vessels of these mice
show some additional vWF immunoreactivity in nonendothelial
structures, we cannot rule out that this increase in vWF expression
level has masked a potential decrease in immunoreactivity
due to vessel loss.
Vascular accumulation of A has been associated with the
deposition of fibrin which leads to the formation of clots that are
structurally abnormal and, hence, resistant to fibrinolysis (Paul et
al., 2007; Cortes-Canteli et al., 2010). Therefore, we used antifibrinogen
immunohistochemistry to investigate whether the vessels
in the 24-month-old arcA mice were functionally altered.
Aggregation of fibrin(ogen) was evident in cortical vessels of 24-
month-old arcAmice, but not in 4-month-old arcAmice and
in none of the age-matched wt controls. Some of the smaller
blood vessels showed signs of stenosis due to the fibrin(ogen)
accumulation. Furthermore, in the aged arcAmice vWF immunoreactivity
was observed in thrombus-like structures in crosssectioned
blood vessels. As vWF displays also thrombogenic
functions (Ruggeri, 2007) this indicates that the vessels of aged
arAare prone to thrombus formation.
The aggregation of fibrin(ogen) was always coincident with
the vascular deposition of A, as indicated by the strong colocalization
of thioflavin S staining and fibrinogen immunoreactivity.
Vessels without Aaccumulation, e.g., in the thalamus, were also
devoid of fibrinogen. Furthermore, A/fibrinogen deposition
seems to preferentially occur in vessels of a radius of 10–40m.
Despite the fact that the absolute vessel diameter estimates of
vessel diameter differ by factor 2–4 between the two methods
(MRI and histology) due to tissue shrinkage during the histological
preparation (Ratering et al., 2011), these vessels correspond
to the same vessel category, which were found to be significantly
reduced in number in the CE-MRA data. Together, these data
indicate that the reduction of the microvascular density in arcA
mice is due to a lack of perfusion of existing blood vessels as a
result of an altered thrombosis and fibrinolysis following vascular
Adeposition.
In summary, high resolution CE-MRA revealed an agedependent
reduction in the density of functional intracortical
vessels (radii of 20–80m) in the arcA mouse. This class of
vessels is known to be preferentially affected by Aaccumulation
and seems to be prone to the formation of fibrin clots leading
ultimately to vessel stenosis. These results suggest that the mechanism
of fibrin accumulation might present therapeutic targets in
slowing the progression of Apathology. Due to its noninvasive
nature, CE-MRA provides a powerful tool to assess the dynamics
of cerebrovascular remodeling in the course of the disease
process and to evaluate therapeutic interventions in mouse models
of AD and CAA.
