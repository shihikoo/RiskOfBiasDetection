SUMMARY
Aims: Cerebrovascular white matter lesion (WML) is a major subtype of cerebral small vessel
disease. Clinical drugs are not available for WML. We investigated whether peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-c agonist pioglitazone, with properties of vascular protection
and antiinflammation, exerts beneficial effect in hypertensive WML rats.Methods:Strokeprone
renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were treated with pioglitazone for 12 weeks.
Morris water maze experiment was conducted to assess cognition. WML was observed by
Luxol fast blue staining. Smooth muscle actin-alpha, collagen I, collagen IV, glial fibrillary
acidic protein, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in 
brain and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in serum were detected.
Results: Pioglitazone significantly attenuated WML in corpus callosum, caudate putamen,
external capsule, and internal capsule. Cognitive impairment in RHRSP was ameliorated by
pioglitazone. Pioglitazone attenuated arteriolar remodeling and reduced sICAM-1 level
in serum. Pioglitazone decreased the proliferation of microglia and astrocyte and lowered
the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a in the white matter.
Conclusions: Long-term treatment of pioglitazone has beneficial effect on hypertensioninduced
WML and cognition decline, which may partly through its effect on attenuation of
arteriolar remodeling, endothelial activation, and brain inflammation.
Introduction
Cerebrovascular white matter lesion (WML), a major subtype of
cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), is characterized by diffuse
areas of hypodensities on CT scans or hyperintensities on T2-
weighted MRI scans in periventricular or subcortical white matter.
Hypertension and age are key risk factors for WML [1,2]. The
probable mechanisms responsible are chronic hypoperfusion [3],
changes in glial cells [4], disruption of blood-brain barrier [5], and
even gene mutation [6]. Arteriosclerosis is observed in most of the
patients with WML [7] and considered to play a critical role in the
pathogenesis of WML. Structural alterations of small arteries with
reduction in cerebral blood flow cause chronic ischemia which
leads to WML. Glial cells are activated following ischemia [4].
Growing evidence shows that glial activation is involved in the
evolution of WML [8,9]. These imply that suppression of vascular
remodeling and antiinflammation might be beneficial to prevent
pathogenesis of WML.
In the vascular system, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-c (PPAR-c) is expressed in endothelium cells and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Activation of PPAR-c exerts protective
effect on some vascular diseases [10]. PPAR-c agonists are
found to attenuate structural changes of vessels, improve
endothelial function, and prevent upregulation of proinflammatory
cytokines in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive rats
[11]. PPAR-c agonists also showed antiinflammatory properties
in diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke
[12,13], Parkinson’s disease [14], and spinal cord injury [15].
As arteriosclerosis and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis
of WML, we presume that PPAR-c agonists may have
a protective effect on WML. In the present study, the strokeprone
renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were used as an
applicable animal model to determine whether PPAR-c activator
pioglitazone, with the vascular protective and antiinflammatory
properties, exerted beneficial effect on hypertensive
WML.

Methods
Animals and Drug Administration
All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal
Research at Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) and
were conducted under the institutional guidelines for animal
experimentation. A total of 42 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
80–100 g were used to establish the RHRSP model, as
described by Zeng et al. [16]. Briefly, under anesthesia with 10%
chloral hydrate (3 mL/kg, intraperitoneal injection), rats underwent
a median longitudinal incision on abdominal skin and the
renal arteries were exposed. Ring-shaped silver clips (0.3 mm in
diameter) were placed around the roots of both right and left
renal arteries. Additional 6 sham-operated rats (SHAM) were
used as controls. At postoperative week 8, RHRSP were randomly
divided into two groups, vehicle-treated RHRSP (RHRSP/veh)
and pioglitazone-treated RHRSP (RHRSP/pio). RHRSP/pio were
treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride tablets daily (10 mg/kg;
Hangzhou, China) by gastric gavage for 12 weeks. RHRSP/veh
and sham-operated rats were treated with saline. At postoperative
week 20, 6 sham-operated rats, 15 RHRSP/veh, and 15 RHRSP/
pio underwent the next experiment. The remaining 12 rats were
excluded from the experiment due to death. Systolic blood pressure
(SBP) was measured at postoperative weeks 8 (before drug
treatment), 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 by the tail-cuff method
(ML866 Powerlab 4/30; ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW,
Australia).
Morris Water Maze Test
Morris water maze (MWM) test was employed at postoperative
week 20. All rats underwent pretraining the day before the
test. Rats were allowed to swim freely in a pool (120 cm diameter
) for 60 seconds. At the training block, rats were placed in
water from four positions sequentially and latency of escaping
onto the platform was recorded (maximum swimming time
60 second). The same training was conducted consecutively for
5 days. On the sixth day, the platform was removed. Number
of times of crossing the former platform was recorded for
60 seconds. Data were analyzed from videotape recording
(MWM, DMS-2; Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Peking,
China).
Histopathology
At postoperative week 20, after a deep anesthesia with 10% chloral
hydrate (5 mL/kg, intraperitoneal injection), nine rats in
RHRSP/veh and RHRSP/pio and three rats in SHAM were perfused
transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% formaldehyde
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4). The
brain was removed and tissue block was postfixed for 24–48 h at
4°C. Brain blocks were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-um
sections. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the
overall morphology, and Luxol fast blue staining was used to
examine the nerve fibers and myelin. They were stained according
to the standard procedures.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and bovine serum albumin for 1 h
and then stained with the following primary antibodies:a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), collagen
IV (1:250; Abcam), collagen I (1:250; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:100; Boster, Wuhan,
China), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBa-1)
(1:100; Abcam). Thereafter, they were incubated with secondary
antibody. The products of the immunoreaction were visualized in
3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. PBS 0.01 mol/L
replaced the primary antibody in negative controls.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Six rats in RHRSP/veh and RHRSP/pio and three rats in SHAM
were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline.
The white matter tissues were dissected and homogenized to separate
the supernatant. Blood samples were obtained from the tail
vein. Activity of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-a) in white matter supernatant and activity of soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in the blood
serum were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits (IL-1b and TNF-a ELISA kits were obtained from
Multiscience, Zhejiang, China; sICAM-1 ELISA kit was obtained
from Uscn Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China).
Morphometric Analysis
All parameters were investigated in the white matter regions: corpus
callosum, caudate putamen, external capsule, and internal
capsule. Severity of WML was graded in accordance with previous
reports [4]: grade 0 = normal, grade 1 = disarrangement of the
nerve fibers, grade 2 = formation of marked vacuoles, and grade
3 = disappearance of myelinated fibers.
Arterioles with an external diameter between 15 and 80 lm
were analyzed to assess the small vessel pathology. The arterioles
with long axis:short axis ratio <1.5 were chosen as suitable vessels
for the study. To assess vascular remodeling, the ratio of immunoreactive
area to the luminal area for a-SMA, collagen I, and collagen
IV was calculated using Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) using on-screen measurements.
To assess capillary density, collagen IV immunopositive capillaries
were counted in a predefined area (0.0675 mm2). Three areas
from each rat were selected for counting. Any brown-staining capillary
that was clearly separate from adjacent vessels was considered
as a countable capillary. Capillary number was determined
using Image J software.
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean  SEM and analyzed using IBM
SPSS Version 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
SBP and escape latency in MWM were compared by repeatedmeasure
ANOVA. The severity of WML and percentage of immunoreaction
for a-SMA, collagen I, and collagen IV were analyzed
by the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test and subsequently with

Mann–Whitney U-test. Other data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA followed by least significance difference t-test. P < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Effect of Pioglitazone on Blood Pressure
At postoperative week 20, the mortality rate was 34.78% (8/23)
in vehicle-treated RHRSP and 21.05% (4/19) in pioglitazone-treated
RHRSP. No rat died in sham-operated group. At postoperative
week 8, the average SBP of the vehicle-treated RHRSP and pioglitazone-treated
RHRSP was 152.84  4.28 and 147.31  4.38
mmHg before drug administration. The SBP was significantly
higher in the RHRSP than in the sham-operated rats
throughout the treatment (P < 0.001). There was no significant
difference in SBP between vehicle-treated RHRSP and pioglitazone-treated
RHRSP throughout the treatment (P > 0.05) (Figure
1).
Effect of Pioglitazone on WML
Vehicle-treated RHRSP showed obvious WML. Demyelination,
fracture of fibers, and marked vacuoles were observed in corpus
callosum, caudate putamen, and external capsule of vehicle-treated
RHRSP. Pioglitazone significantly ameliorated WML with less
rarefaction in the white matter (Figure 2). Grading scores for
WML were lower in the pioglitazone-treated RHRSP than in the
vehicle-treated RHRSP in corpus callosum, caudate putamen,
external capsule, and internal capsule (Table 1).
Effect of Pioglitazone on Cognition
As shown in Figure 3, escape latencies were decreased following
the 5-day training sessions in all rats. However, vehicle-treated
RHRSP had longer escape latencies than sham-operated rats
(P < 0.01), indicating learning deficit in RHRSP. Pioglitazone
treatment significantly shortened escape latencies in RHRSP
(P < 0.001). The average times of crossing the hidden platform
were 4.56  0.41 in the pioglitazone-treated RHRSP and
5.20  0.51 in the sham-operated rats versus 2.33  0.73 in the
vehicle-treated RHRSP (P < 0.05). These results indicated memory
impairment in RHRSP and the protective effect by pioglitazone.
Effect of Pioglitazone on Small Vessel Lesions
As shown in Figure 4I, obvious small vessel remodeling was
seen in vehicle-treated RHRSP. In thickened small vessels,
increase of positive immunoreactive area for a-SMA, collagen I,
and collagen IV was observed, demonstrating the hyperplasia or
hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the accumulation
of extracellular matrix in RHRSP. The immunoreactive area
/ lumen area ratio for a-SMA (1.99  0.16 vs. 0.49  0.05),
collagen I (0.94  0.10 vs. 0.51  0.06), and collagen IV
(1.42  0.12 vs. 0.55  0.04) was significantly greater in vehicle-treated
RHRSP than those in sham-operated rats. Pioglitazone
significantly ameliorated arteriolar wall thickening.
Pioglitazone-treated RHRSP showed significantly less expression
of a-SMA (0.59  0.04 vs. 1.99  0.16), collagen I (0.55  0.12
vs. 0.94  0.10), and collagen IV (0.57  0.05 vs. 1.42  0.12)
than the vehicle-treated RHRSP. As shown in Figure 5, the
number of capillaries was 16.67  0.82, 11.67  0.46, and
12.44  0.51 per 0.0675 mm2 in sham-operated rats, vehicletreated
RHRSP, and pioglitazone-treated RHRSP, respectively. A
reduction in capillaries density was observed in the vehicle-treated
RHRSP, compared with sham-operated rats. Although it is
not significant (P > 0.05), pioglitazone attenuated the microvascular
rarefaction in RHRSP.
The expression of sICAM-1 showed a 1.3-fold (1.41  0.10 vs.
1.06  0.03 ng/mL) increase in the vehicle-treated RHRSP than
in the sham-operated rats. The increase in the level of sICAM-1 in
RHRSP was significantly attenuated by pioglitazone (1.41  0.10
vs. 1.06  0.06 ng/mL) (Figure 4II).
Effect of Pioglitazone on Brain Inflammation
In corpus callosum of vehicle-treated RHRSP, GFAP-immunopositive
astrocyte and IBa-1-immunopositive microglia were activated
, and expressions of IL-1b and TNF-a were 1.3-fold
(95.28  17.95 vs. 72.30  12.30 pg/mL) and 1.5-fold
(12.49  1.11 vs. 8.17  1.59 pg/mL), respectively, than the
sham-operated rats (Figure 6). Pioglitazone treatment significantly
attenuated the activation of astrocyte and microglia in
RHRSP and subsequently lowered the increasing level of IL-1b
(95.28  17.95 vs. 50.01  10.95 pg/mL) and TNF-a
(12.49  1.11 vs. 5.86  1.25 pg/mL) in the white matter
(Figure 6).

Discussion
The present study indicates that long-term treatment of pioglitazone
attenuated vascular remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, and
brain inflammation as well as stimulated angiogenesis in RHRSP.
Furthermore, pioglitazone provided beneficial effect on hypertensive
WML and cognition decline without affecting arterial blood
pressure.
The PROactive Study (PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial
In macroVascular Events) found that pioglitazone reduced macrovascular
events in patients with type 2 diabetes [17]. Further
animal experiment examined the effect of pioglitazone on incidental
stroke caused by hypertension and found that pioglitazone
significantly protected against hypertension-induced cerebrovascular
injury and stroke by its multiple effects [13]. Even though
pioglitazone is widely investigated in preventing macrovascular
events [12,13,18], few is known about its effects in cerebral small
vessel disease. Our study focused on the effect of pioglitazone on
WML, one of the major subtypes of SVD, and found that pioglitazone
prevented the occurrence and progression of hypertensive
WML, as evidenced by attenuation of demyelination, fracture of
fibers, and marked vacuoles in the white matter. This founding is
in agreement with previous study that activation of PPAR-cby telmisartan
ameliorated WML in mice with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion
[19]. The pathogenesis and pathology of WML in RHRSP
is very similar to that of human WML. Therefore, the observed

beneficial effect of pioglitazone on WML highlights it as a potential
candidate for SVD therapy.
The effect of pioglitazone on cognition was investigated by morris
water maze test. RHRSP showed significant cognitive impairment
resulting from long-term hypertension. Pioglitazone
treatment significantly attenuated the acquisition and retention
deficits in RHRSP. PPAR-cactivation was found to improve hippocampus
cognition in Alzheimer’s disease through its effect of
inflammation suppression and amyloid-b clearance [20]. However
, in hypertensive rats, the cognition decline is not only associated
with hippocampus, but white matter and cerebral cortex
[21]. Evidence has shown that cognitive deficit resulting from
high blood pressure is probably mainly mediated by WML [22].
Therefore, we supposed that pioglitazone restored the cognitive
function in hypertensive rats may be partly by attenuation of
WML.
In previous studies, treatment of PPAR-c agonists was reported
to show small but significant reduction in blood pressure levels
[23]. However, in hypertensive patients or animal models not
associated with metabolic syndrome, the effect of PPAR-c agonist
on blood pressure is still controversial [13,24,25]. In the present
study, pioglitazone at a dose of 10 mg/kg did not alter the blood
pressure levels in RHRSP. The discrepancy may be explained by
difference in diseases, animal models, dose of glitazone, or time of
treatment. Moreover, the consistency of blood pressure in
RHRSP/veh and RHRSP/pio suggested that pioglitazone prevented
cerebralvascular injury and white matter changes independently
of blood pressure.
Vascular remodeling was believed to be ascribed to media and
basement membrane thickening, collagen deposition, and lumen
narrowing [26]. In our study, immunohistochemistry for a-SMA,
collagen I, and collagen IV showed the structural changes of artery

in RHRSP, which are markers for smooth muscle cells, vessel wall
scaring, and basement membrane, respectively. Previous studies
also showed these changes in hypertensive animal model or
humans [7,26]. It was proved that small-artery structural alteration
is a potent predictor of cardiocerebrovascular events [27,28].
Pioglitazone markedly inhibited small vessel remodeling, as
evidenced by decrease of a-SMA, collagen I, and collagen IV in
arteriolar wall. Pioglitazone treatment also significantly attenuated
vascular endothelial activation with reduction of sICAM-1
level, which was supposed to play a causative role in the pathogenesis
of WML [29]. However, Pioglitazone did not prevent
microvascular rarefaction in RHRSP. Previous study showed that

pioglitazone prevented microvascular rarefaction and improved
vascular function in the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME)-
induced hypertensive rats [30]. In our study, we observed a tendency
of increase in capillary number of pioglitazone-treated rats,
although the data did not reach significant difference. We supposed
that the short duration of pathological state (20 weeks after hypertension
) and time of drug administration may count for the difference.
Moreover, pioglitazone ameliorated chronic inflammation in
white matter of RHRSP, which was demonstrated by suppression
of the astrocyte and microglial activation, decrease of inflammatory
cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a level. PPAR-c agonists were reported to
prevent inflammation in transient focal ischemia [12] or traumatic
spinal cord injury [15]. But our study has provided evidence that
PPAR-c agonists also attenuated chronic inflammation in hypertensive
disease. Our study showed that pioglitazone ameliorated
WML, endothelial activation, arteriolar remodeling, and inflammation
and promoted neovascularization. As small vessel pathology
and glial activation [4,31] have been well accepted involving the
evolution of WML, it was presumed that the beneficial effect of
pioglitazone on WML might be attributed to the attenuation of
cerebral vascular injury and inflammation. However, this assumption
needs to be studied in the further research.
In summary, the present study found that pioglitazone ameliorated
WML and cognition decline in hypertensive rats, which may
be partly contributed to its effect on attenuation of endothelial
activation, arteriolar remodeling, and inflammation.
