We proposed that metabolic remodeling in the form of increased
uptake of the myocardial glucose analog 18F-FDG precedes
and triggers the onset of severe contractile dysfunction
in pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. To test
this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) together with PET and assessed serial changes
in cardiac metabolism and function over 7 d.Methods: Scans of
16 C57BL/6 male mice were obtained using a small-animal PET
device under sevoflurane anesthesia. A 10-min transmission scan
was followed by a 60-min dynamic 18F-FDG PET scan with
cardiac and respiratory gating. Blood glucose levels were
measured before and after the emission scan. TAC and sham
surgeries were performed after baseline imaging. Osmotic mini
pumps containing either propranolol (5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone
were implanted subcutaneously at the end of surgery. Subsequent
scans were taken at days 1 and 7 after surgery. A compartment
model, in which the blood input function with spillover
and partial-volume corrections and the metabolic rate constants
in a 3-compartment model are simultaneously estimated, was
used to determine the net myocardial 18F-FDG influx constant,
Ki. The rate of myocardial glucose utilization, rMGU, was also
computed. Estimations of the ejection fractions were based
on the high-resolution gated PET images. Results: Mice undergoing
TAC surgery exhibited an increase in the Ki (580%) and
glucose utilization the day after surgery, indicating early adaptive
response. On day 7, the ejection fraction had decreased by 24%,
indicating a maladaptive response. Average Ki increases were not
linearly associated with increases in rMGU. Ki exceeded rMGU
by 29% in the TAC mice. TAC mice treated with propranolol
attenuated the rate of 18F-FDG uptake, diminished mismatch
between Ki and rMGU (9%), and rescued cardiac function.
Conclusion: Metabolic maladaptation precedes the onset
of severe contractile dysfunction. Both are prevented by
treatment with propranolol. The early detection of metabolic
remodeling may offer a metabolic target for modulation of
hypertrophy.

yocardial hypertrophy is considered initially an
adaptive response to stress. When stress is sustained, however
, hypertrophy becomes maladaptive. Both functional
and structural changes are accompanied by changes in energy
substrate metabolism. A hallmark finding in myocardial
hypertrophy is a shift away from fatty-acid to glucose oxidation
(1). On the basis of earlier work ex vivo, we have
proposed that this metabolic remodeling precedes as well
as triggers left ventricular (LV) structural and functional
remodeling in pressure-overload LV hypertrophy (LVH)
and induces the fetal gene program (2–4). However, this
hypothesis has never been evaluated in vivo. For this purpose,
we used the mouse model of LV pressure overload after
transverse aortic constriction (TAC) as a clinically relevant
model to assess metabolism and function of the heart
subjected to pressure overload using 18F-FDG PET imaging.
A compartmental modeling technique was used to analyze
images obtained dynamically to compute the rate of myocardial 18F-FDG uptake and use. The quantification of these
rates has been limited by the following 2 important factors:
first, the limited spatial resolution of the small-animal PET
scanners (5,6) leading to partial-volume (PV) effects, and
second,thespilloverofradio activity from the blood pool
to the myocardium, and vice versa. A major shortcoming of
the image-derived blood input function (IDIF) method is that
it is susceptible to spillover and PV effects (7).
In this study, a (compartment) model–corrected blood
input function (MCBIF) was optimized, wherein the blood
input function with spillover and PV corrections and the
metabolic rate constants in a 3-compartment model were
simultaneously estimated from ordered-subset expectation
maximization maximum a posteriori (OSEM-MAP)
cardiac and respiration-gated PET images with attenuation

using high-resolution gated PET images, enabling us
to perform a side-by-side comparison of cardiac metabolism
and LV function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Model
Sixteen adult C57BL/6 male mice (age, 9–10 wk) obtained
from Charles River were imaged at baseline using a microPET
Focus-F120 scanner (Siemens, Inc.) under sevoflurane anesthesia
(9). A subset of these mice (n511) was subjected to a TAC surgical
procedure to induce pressure-overload hypertrophy (10). Briefly,
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intubated for ventilation.
A thoracotomy was performed, and a 7-0 silk suture was tied around
the transverse aorta between the proximal and distal carotid arteries
against a 27-gauge needle, after which, the needle was removed.
Osmotic mini pumps containing either propranolol (5 mg/kg/d;
Sigma Aldrich Inc.) (n 5 6) or vehicle alone (n 5 5) were
implanted subcutaneously at the end of surgery. In addition, 5
sham-operated animals were subjected to the same surgical protocol
, without tying off the suture. Before and after surgery, all
mice were kept in an environment of 12-h light/12-h dark. Before
imaging, animals were (11) overnight with access only to water.
PET scans were obtained between 9 AM and 5 PM on anesthetized
animals. All experiments were performed in compliance with
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (12) and
were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia.
Small-Animal PET Imaging
PET imaging for measuring myocardial 18F-FDG uptake and
glucose utilization was performed using 18F-FDG in the sham mice,
TAC mice, and TAC mice treated with propranolol as follows: after the
insertion of a tail-vein catheter, electrocardiograph surface electrodes
(Blue Sensor; Ambu Inc.) were placed on both forepaws and the left
hind paw, and a pneumatic respiratory pillow was placed on the animal
’s chest. Dynamic PET scans (60 min) were obtained under 2.5%
sevoflurane anesthesia in oxygen (9), where data acquisition was initiated
a few seconds before the slow administration of about 29.6 MBq
(800 mCi) of 18F-FDG over 30–60 svia the catheter. A Small Animal
Monitoring and Gating System (model 1025 L; Small Animal Instruments
, Inc.) for PET imaging was used to continuously monitor heart
rate, respiration, and core body temperature (rectal probe). Cardiac gate
signals were generated at the end-expiration phase of the respiratory
cycle to time-stamp the PET scanner data for subsequent retrospective
reordering into heart- and respiratory-cycle–based time bins (13).
Transmission scans using a 57Co point source were obtained for
attenuation correction before 18F-FDG administration. The listmode
data (sorted into 23 time bins [11 · 8, 1 · 12, 2 · 60, 1 ·
180, and 8·400 s] and 3 gates [hence referred to as gated]) were
reconstructed using an OSEM-MAP algorithm (14,15) with attenuation
correction. For comparison the data were also reconstructed
using a filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm (ramp
filter cut off at the Nyquist frequency) with the same spatial resolution
without gating. The images were corrected for radioactive decay
, random coincidences, and dead-time losses using the microPET
Manager (Siemens Inc.). Regions of interest in the area corresponding
to the LV blood pool and the myocardium were drawn in the last
frame and the last gate of the dynamic image data, and time–activity
curves for the LV blood pool and the myocardium were generated
for the whole scan duration of 60 min. Blood samples were also
collected at around 43 and 56 min after 18F-FDG administration
from the tail vein to validate the MCBIF. Three blood samples before
and 3 blood samples after the PET scan were drawn by a tail-vein
nick to measure blood glucose levels using a glucometer (Accu-
Chek; Roche). The average of these blood glucose readings was used
to compute the rate of myocardial glucose utilization (rMGU).
An MCBIF (8,16), based on the simultaneous estimation of the
blood input function with spillover and PV corrections and the
metabolic rate constants, was optimized in this study. The formalism
for MCBIF was used to measure the net myocardial 18F-FDG
influx, Ki, and hence glucose utilization, rMGU, in vivo in the
sham mice, TAC mice, and TAC mice treated with propranolol.
End-systolic volumes (ESV) and end-diastolic volumes (EDV)
were also measured by drawing regions of interest at the end-systolic
and end-diastolic phases of the heart cycle over multiple slices
covering the whole heart from the apex to the base. The volumes
obtained in each phase over multiple slices were summed to obtain
net ESV and EDV in microliters (mL). The LVEF was measured by
the following equation: (EDV2 ESV)/(EDV) · 100%.

The optimization was performed by minimizing the objective
function (Eq. 10) in the MATLAB programming environment using
the function “fmincon,” which is based on an interior-reflective
Newton method. The initial guesses and bounds for the PVaveraging
coefficients (r

and hence Ki along with the

), without the need
for any blood sampling. Simultaneous estimation results in the
blood input function, Equation 9, to be free of spillover contamination
and PV-corrected in a 3-compartment model. The rate of
myocardial glucose utilization can then be computed as:
rMGU5 Ki½Glu=LC; (Eq. 11)
in mmol/g/min, where [Glu] is the average nonradioactive blood
glucose levels measured using a glucometer and LC is the lumped
constant. The LC corrects the difference of affinity between glucose
and 18F-FDG to glucose transporters and the phosphorylating
system. In recent years, the value of the LC has been questioned,
and it is uncertain which value should be used (19–22). In the
3-compartment model of glucose transfer into cells, the LC is a
function of the correlation between the net and the unidirectional
rates of uptake of glucose and glucose tracers such as 18F-FDG. For
the sake of simplicity, we, like many investigators, have used an LC
of 1 (23,24).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.0 (SPSS,
Inc.). Mean values of Ki, [Glu], rMGU, and LVEF were calculated
with SE. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm–Sidak
post hoc tests were used to compare mean values in the sham mice,
TAC mice, and TAC mice treated with propranolol at different time
points. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS

OSEM-MAP Gated Images
Representative IDIFs obtained from OSEM-MAP gated
images and from FBP ungated images with attenuation
correction are shown in Figure 2A. MCBIF applied to IDIF
obtained from OSEM-MAP gated and FBP ungated images
are also shown in the figure. The venous blood samples at 43
and 56 min are shown for comparison. MCBIF applied to the
IDIF obtained from high-resolution gated images correctly
accounted for the washout dynamics of 18F-FDG from the
blood, when compared with the late venous blood samples.
Figure 2B shows MCBIF estimation during the first 5 min of
the scan, indicating improved PV recovery when applied to
IDIF obtained from OSEM-MAP gated images as compared
with that obtained from ungated FBP images.
A residual plot of MCBIF applied to high-resolution
gated images, when compared with the 2 late venous blood
samples obtained from control mice (n5 6), is shown in
Figure 3. The analysis revealed an average difference of
0.017 MBq/cm3. The precision (SD of differences) was
0.13 MBq/cm3. The figure also shows the analysis obtained

Metabolic Remodeling in LVH in Mice in Vivo
Figure 4 shows representative gated transverse PET
images at the last time bin for the sham mice, TAC mice,
and TAC mice treated with propranolol at baseline, day 1,
and day 7 after surgery. All scans are from the same animals.
The images indicate an enlargement in the LV cavity
over a period of 7 d in the TAC mice. The images also show
an increase in 18F-FDG uptake in the TAC mice starting at
day 1 indicative of metabolic adaptation in pressure-overload
LVH.
The measured rate of myocardial 18F-FDG uptake, Ki
(mL/g/min), for the mice in the 3 categories is shown in
Figure 5A over a period of 7 d. The plot shows increased
myocardial 18F-FDG uptake at day 1 after TAC surgery by
580%, indicating an adaptive response with preserved
LVEF (Fig. 5B). Ki increased further at day 7, with a drop
in function by 24%. The blood glucose levels and rMGU
are also shown in Figures 6A and 6B for the 3 categories
over a period of 7 d. We observed a drop in blood glucose
levels at day 1 for the sham mice, TAC mice, and TAC mice
treated with propranolol. Mice treated with propranolol
showed an elevation in blood glucose levels at day 7, significantly
different from day 1 and comparable to the sham
group or mice at baseline. The TAC mice exhibited an insignificant
increase in blood glucose levels between days
1 and 7 (Fig. 6A). The rMGU (Fig. 6B) did not increase
linearly with Ki. Rather, rMGU increased at a much slower
rate than Ki, thereby resulting in a mismatch of 29% between
Ki and rMGU in the TAC mice (Fig. 7). On the other
hand, early treatment with propranolol (25) targeting metabolic
alterations served to attenuate the rate of myocardial
18F-FDG uptake (Fig. 5A) reduce mismatch between Ki and
rMGU to 9%, and rescue cardiac function (Fig. 5B). The
metabolic changes and cardiac function in the TAC mice
treated with propranolol were comparable to those in the
sham group. The in vivo imaging results suggest that early
metabolic remodeling may precede and trigger the onset of
severe contractile dysfunction in LVH in mice.
DISCUSSION
In the normal heart, fatty acid oxidation is the predominant
source (60%–90%) of adenosine triphosphate, with glucose
oxidation and lactate contributing the rest (26). Stress on the
myocardium, such as biomechanical stress from pressure
overload, changes normal myocardial substrate metabolism.
In the case of pressure-overload–induced hypertrophy, the
prevailing notion is that alterations in energy substrate metabolism
adversely affect the response to myocardial ischemic
stresses and contribute to contractile dysfunction. Specifically,
in the hypertrophic heart there is a shift away from fatty acid
oxidation toward glucose metabolism (1). At least initially,

this metabolic remodeling may be considered as adaptive,
most likely because glucose oxidation yields more adenosine
triphosphate per atom of oxygen (2). With time, however, the
adaptive response becomes maladaptive because this shift in
metabolism does not increase adenosine triphosphate production
commensurate with the increased demand for energy
by the heart.
Recently, we have proposed a requirement for hexose 
6-phosphate in mammalian-target-of-rapamycin signaling
and cardiac growth (27). However, in the setting of insulin
resistance, an oversupply of substrate (glucose) may “starve
the heart in the midst of plenty” (28). The hypothesis, however
, has never been tested serially in vivo because of the
limited availability of technologies for studying complex
metabolic parameters and LV function. It is tempting to
speculate that strategies to improve myocardial substrate
use and to improve metabolic flexibility (3,29) in the hypertrophic
heart may improve contractile performance and
preventtheonsetofheartfailure.
During acute pressure overload and inotropic stimulation
(30), glucose oxidation is increased, but it is not yet completely
clear how glucose uptake is related to LV function
during pressure-overload LVH. Studies using SPECT imaging
have demonstrated that the metabolic switch can be
measured in both small animals and human beings (31,32).
However, a serial study on the temporal relationship between
glucose uptake and cardiac function in vivo in mice using
PET has not been done. We demonstrated that MCBIF applied
to an IDIF obtained from high-resolution gated images
with less severe spillover and PV effects is quantitative and
also repetitive as compared with that obtained from lowresolution
ungated images (16). The results of our present
study support the hypothesis that an increase in glucose metabolism
in the form of increased 18F-FDG uptake precedes
and triggers the onset of severe dysfunction of the heart in
LVH. This finding is important because early detection of
metabolic remodeling may lead to early intervention targeting
metabolic changes to prevent the onset of severe contractile
dysfunction and improve patient outcomes clinically.
We also observed that early treatment with propranolol
served to attenuate myocardial glucose uptake and rescue
cardiac function in vivo. Thus, metabolic imaging with
18F-FDG PET may provide an early indication of a beneficial
effect of a therapy, possibly presenting a platform for aggressive
treatment strategies to improve outcomes clinically.
Dietary conditions affect 18F-FDG PET imaging studies
(33). Some clinical studies use glucose load conditions without
fasting to obtain higher-quality images. On the other
hand, fasting can produce similar-quality images. Because
we are interested in 18F-FDG dynamics, a reasonable contrast
between the blood pool and the myocardial tissue
enables us to draw regions of interest and determine rate
of myocardial 18F-FDG influx with spillover and PV corrections.
Moreover, performing glucose clamping in addition to
the TAC surgery in mice is challenging, thus we resort to
overnight fasting for our 18F-FDG PET scans to achieve uniform
metabolic conditions to obtain Ki and rMGU.
The LC is an important parameter in the determination of
the rMGU in a dynamic PET scan. This value may vary,
depending on plasma substrate and hormonal conditions.
Many authors have used a constant value of LC to compute

myocardial glucose utilization in humans with type 2 diabetes
(34). Botker et al. (35) proposed thatLCis a function of rates of
18F-FDG transport and phosphorylation and applied the
method to assess myocardial glucose utilization in humans with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (36). In a study by Herrero et al.
(37), a constant value of LC was used for assessing myocardial
glucose utilization for 18F-FDG PET studies in dogs. However
, they also observed that the correlation between
Fick-derived and PET-derived rMGU has a lower correlation
with the variable LC. The correlation coefficient does not
differ after correcting for an LC of 0.67 for 18F-FDG PET
studies. In addition, they noted that using the variable LC
leads to a significant underestimation of rMGU in large animals.
In the current work, we used an LC of 1 because we
did not measure this constant and there is no consensus on
how to deal with this issue. The concerns expressed earlier
by Botker et al. (35) do not apply because here the metabolic
conditions were the same for all animals and in steady state.
Nevertheless, further studies need to be done to characterize
LC in small-animal PET imaging of the heart.
Our study was not without limitations. First, 18F-FDG
can be considered only as a surrogate marker for glucose
metabolism. Although 18F-FDG indirectly assesses glucose
transport and phosphorylation, the tracer analog is subjected
to changes in the LC (19). Second, although clinically relevant
, the acute nature of the model might have been a limitation
in evaluating the hypothesis of metabolic remodeling
that precedes and triggers cardiac dysfunction in LVH. The
slowly progressive Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rat model
may be more relevant to evaluate metabolic and functional
changes in the heart, in vivo, but the costs for a study such as
the present one would be prohibitive (38). Using the 1-kidney,
1-clip rabbit model of hypertension, we have already shown
by invasive measurements that metabolic remodeling of the
heart precedes hypertrophy (2). Third, we did not consider any
possible differences in plasma substrate or hormone levels,
although all scans were obtained under the same conditions
and any errors would be systematic errors.
CONCLUSION
Noninvasive serial imaging of the heart subjected to
pressure-overload hypertrophy using PET supports the
hypothesis that changes in the glucose analog 18F-FDG
metabolism precede and trigger the onset of severe cardiac
dysfunction in LVH. We found that enhanced uptake of
18F-FDG by the myocardium in mice subjected to pressureoverload
hypertrophy precedes and possibly triggers the
onset of contractile dysfunction. Early intervention with
a standard-of-care treatment prevented maladaptive response
and rescued cardiac function. We speculate that
early detection of metabolic remodeling may offer a metabolic
target for modulation of hypertrophy.

FIGURE 7. Comparison between Ki and rMGU measured in vivo
at day 7. rMGU did not increase linearly with Ki. rMGU increased at
much slower rate than Ki, resulting in mismatch of 29% between Ki
and rMGU in TAC mice. Treatment with propranolol reduced mismatch
to 9% and rescued cardiac function.
