Neuroprotection by Interleukin-6 Is Mediated by Signal
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 and
Antioxidative Signaling in Ischemic Stroke
Joo Eun Jung, PhD; Gab Seok Kim, PhD; Pak H. Chan, PhD
Background and Purpose—Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemic injury.
However, its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role
of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) by IL-6 in the reactive oxygen species defense system after transient focal cerebral
ischemia (tFCI).
Methods—IL-6 was injected in mice before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were
performed for analysis of an IL-6R association after tFCI. Primary mouse cerebral cortical neurons were transfected with
small interfering RNA probes targeted to IL-6R or gp130 and were used for chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay,
luciferase promoter assay, and cell viability assay. Reduction in infarct volumes by IL-6 was measured after tFCI.
Results—IL-6R was disrupted through a disassembly between IL-6R and gp130 associated by protein oxidation after
reperfusion after tFCI. This suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
and finally induced neuronal cell death through a decrease in manganese–superoxide dismutase. However, IL-6
injections prevented disruption of IL-6R against reperfusion after tFCI, consequently restoring activity of STAT3
through recovery of the binding of STAT3 to gp130. Moreover, IL-6 injections restored the transcriptional activity of
the manganese–superoxide dismutase promoter through recovery of the recruitment of STAT3 to the manganese–
superoxide dismutase promoter and reduced infarct volume after tFCI.
Conclusions—This study demonstrates that IL-6 has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury through
IL-6R-mediated STAT3 activation and manganese–superoxide dismutase expression. (Stroke. 2011;42:3574-3579.)
Key Words: cerebral ischemia  IL-6  Mn-SOD  neuroprotection  STAT3
Many studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective
effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in ischemic brain injuries
,1–5 although a few studies suggest that IL-6 has an
injurious effect.6 Continuous injection of IL-6 reduced neuronal
loss after forebrain ischemia,4 and injection of the IL-6
receptor (IL-6R) antibody after middle cerebral artery occlusion
increased cell death and infarct volume.3 However, the
mechanism of neuroprotection by IL-6 in relation to IL-6R in
cerebral ischemia has not been fully elucidated.
The action of IL-6 begins at the cell surface through its
binding to IL-6R,7 which is composed of 2 major subunits, a
ligand binding  subunit (IL-6R) and a  subunit (gp130),
which is a transmembrane glycoprotein with signal transduction
capability.7 The binding of IL-6 to IL-6R induces
homodimerization of gp1307 and consequently recruits the
Janus kinase (JAK) to the cytosolic part of gp130.7 Recruited
JAK becomes phosphorylated and phosphorylates multiple
tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic part of gp130, thereby
creating docking sites for signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3).8 The recruited STAT3 is then
phosphorylated at Y705 residues and phosphorylated STAT3
(p-STAT3; Y705) dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus,
where it binds to the promoter of target genes to regulate
transcription.8
STAT3 is involved in neuroprotection against various
brain injuries, including cerebral ischemia.3,9–11 After brain
ischemia, superoxide anions and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are produced in mitochondria. These ROS induce the
mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways.12,13 These
ROS, however, are removed by manganese-containing superoxide
dismutase (Mn-SOD or SOD2), a primary cellular
defense antioxidant enzyme specific to superoxide.14 STAT3
regulates transcription of the Mn-SOD gene in the mouse
cerebral cortex and cortical neurons.11 In this study, we
elucidated the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection by
IL-6 in relation to IL-6R-mediated STAT3/ROS regulation in
mouse ischemic brains.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All procedures in experiments with animals were performed in
accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were
approved by Stanford University’s Administrative Panel on Laboratory
Animal Care. Male CD1 mice (30–35 g, 2 months old) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).
Heterozygous SOD2 knockout mutant mice (CD1/SV129 background
, backcrossed with CD1 for 10 generations) and their
wild-type (WT) littermates with an identical genetic background
were used. Heterozygous copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase transgenic
(SOD1 TG) mice (SOD1 TGHS/SF-218-3 strain with a CD1
background) and their WT littermates with an identical genetic
background were also used.
Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Forty-five minutes of transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI) were
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. CD1 mice were
anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide and 30%
oxygen using a face mask and maintained with 1.5% isoflurane
during surgery. Rectal temperature was kept at 37°C with a homeothermic
blanket. An 11.0-mm 6-0 surgical monofilament nylon
suture, blunted at the tip, was introduced into the left internal carotid
artery through the external carotid artery stump. After 45 minutes of
middle cerebral artery occlusion, the nylon suture was withdrawn,
restoring blood flow. Sham-operated mice underwent the same
procedure without occlusion of the vessels.
Statistical Analysis
All results were obtained from 3 to 5 independent experiments and
are presented as meanSEM. Data are expressed using Student t
test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a probability
value0.05.
Detailed descriptions of our methods appear in the Supplemental
Material (http://stroke.ahajournals.org). These methods include, primary
cortical neuron culture, oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation
, IL-6 treatments, coimmunoprecipitation assay, immunofluorescence
staining and confocal microscopy, detection of protein
oxidation, small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, Western
blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, luciferase activity assay,
determination of infarction, and cell death assay.
Results
IL-6 Increases p-STAT3 and Mn-SOD Expression
in the Ischemic Brain and Cortical Neurons
To investigate the neuroprotective effect of IL-6, 2 intracerebroventricular
injections of IL-6 (50 ng in 2 L of 
phosphate-buffered saline) were administered 30 minutes
before and 15 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion
in mice. We then examined the change in p-STAT3 and
Mn-SOD expression caused by IL-6 in ischemic cerebral
tissue. Injections of IL-6 significantly recovered p-STAT3
and Mn-SOD expression, which was reduced by 3 hours of
reperfusion in the cerebral ischemic cortex (Figure 1A). The
Mn-SOD mRNA level also recovered after these injections
(data not shown). In addition, recovery of p-STAT3 and
Mn-SOD expression (Figure 1B) and the Mn-SOD mRNA
level (data not shown) was detected after treatment with IL-6
(50 ng/mL) in primary cortical neurons subjected to 2.5 hours
of oxygen–glucose deprivation/4 hours of reoxygenation.
Disruption of IL-6R by Ischemic Reperfusion in
Mouse Cerebral Cortex and Cortical Neurons
To elucidate the neuroprotective role of IL-6R by IL-6 in
cerebral ischemic injury, we first examined the conformational
status of IL-6R using a coimmunoprecipitation assay of
ischemic mouse brain tissue. We found that there was an
interaction between IL-6R and gp130 in IL-6R with sham

surgery under normal physiological conditions in mouse
brain cortices (Figure 1C). The specificity of each antibody
used in this assay was confirmed using normal rabbit IgG as
a negative control (Supplemental Figure IA–B). Interestingly,
this interaction dissociated within 3 hours of reperfusion after
tFCI (Figure 1C). The association between IL-6Rand gp130
subsequently causes phosphorylation of JAK, and phosphorylated
JAK phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues on the
cytoplasmic part of gp130.8 However, the dissociation between
IL-6R and gp130 after reperfusion in cerebral ischemic
injury caused suppression of JAK2 phosphorylation
(Y1007/1008) and then blocked phosphorylation of multityrosine
residues on the cytosolic part of gp130 (Supplemental
Figure IC). This sequential disruption blocked recruitment of
STAT3 to the cytosolic domain of gp130 (Figure 1D) and
then finally blocked phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705; Supplemental
Figure IC). However, IL-6 injections restored the
association between IL-6Rand gp130 and reinstated recruitment
and phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figure 1C–D). The
dissociation of IL-6R after reperfusion after tFCI in vivo and
the recovery of the IL-6R association by IL-6 were also
confirmed using a confocal microscope (Supplemental Figure
II). Moreover, the same disruption of IL-6R was revealed in
cerebral cortical neurons within 4 hours of reoxygenation
after 2.5 hours of oxygen–glucose deprivation (Supplemental
Figure IIIA–B). This disruption of IL-6R suppressed recruitment
of STAT3 to the cytosolic domain of gp130 (Supplemental
Figure IIIC), and treatment with IL-6 restored the
assembly in the IL-6R component (Supplemental Figure III).
We found a continuous association between IL-6R and
gp130 in the mouse cerebral cortex and cortical neurons
under normal conditions (Figure 1C; Supplemental Figures II
and III). This continuous association led to the recruitment of
STAT3 to the cytosolic domain of gp130 and phosphorylation
of STAT3 (Y705), even under normal conditions (Figure
1D; Supplemental Figures IC and IIIC). These results explain
why STAT3 had high activity, even in normal brain tissue
and cortical neurons, in our previous report.11
Oxidation of Each Component of IL-6R Caused by
Reperfusion in the Mouse Cerebral Ischemic
Cortex and Cortical Neurons
To clarify why the association between IL-6R and gp130 is
blocked after reperfusion after tFCI, we examined oxidative
injury caused directly by reperfusion in each component of
IL-6R. Under exposure to ROS, proteins are processed to
oxidative modification, which can lead to conformational
changes in the proteins.15 We measured the quantification of
proteins modified by oxygen free radicals using 2,4-
dinitrophenyl, which specifically reacted with the oxidized
carbonyl residue on the protein samples.16To detect oxidation
of IL-6R or gp130 after reperfusion after tFCI, the oxidized
proteins were immunoprecipitated by an anti-2,4-
dinitrophenyl antibody and then immunoblotted using IL-
6Ror gp130 antibodies. As shown in Figure 2, the oxidation
level of IL-6R or gp130 was significantly increased after 3
hours of reperfusion in the cerebral ischemic cortex (Figure
2A–B). However, oxidation of STAT3 was not detected
(Figure 2C). Interestingly, injections of IL-6 blocked oxidation
of IL-6R and gp130 in the cerebral ischemic cortex.
Also, the oxidation level of IL-6R or gp130 was significantly
increased after 4 hours of reoxygenation in cortical
neurons subjected to 2.5 hours of oxygen–glucose deprivation
, and this oxidation was blocked by IL-6 treatments
(Supplemental Figure IVA–B).
To confirm whether protein oxidation in each IL-6R
component causes a disassociation of IL-6R, we compared
the level of disassociation of IL-6R caused by ischemic
reperfusion between the SOD1 TG mice and the WT mice.
The level of the disassociation between IL-6R and gp130 in
the SOD1 TG mice was lower than in the WT mice
(Supplemental Figure IVD). These results indicate that the
acute influx of oxygen during reperfusion after tFCI induces
the oxidation of IL-6R and gp130 and that these consequently
cause a disassociation of each component of IL-6R.

Gene Silencing of IL-6R Causes a Decrease in
Mn-SOD Expression Through STAT3 Inactivation
in Cerebral Cortical Neurons
IL-6 injections restored the IL-6R association, consequently
leading to the recovery of p-STAT3 (Y705) and Mn-SOD
levels after reperfusion in the cerebral ischemic cortex (Figure
1). These results indicate that IL-6R is an upstream
regulator in STAT3-mediated Mn-SOD expression in the
mouse cerebral cortex. To clarify this, we applied the siRNA
transfection system for knockdown of each component of
IL-6R in mouse cerebral cortical neurons and then examined
STAT3 activity and the Mn-SOD level. As shown in Figure
3, the transfection efficiency of each specific siRNA was
confirmed by quantification of the total protein level for
IL-6R or gp130. Inhibition of IL-6R or gp130 by transfection
with each specific siRNA in cerebral cortical neurons
significantly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation and Mn-SOD
expression. Reduction in Mn-SOD by STAT3 inhibition was
also confirmed using the STAT3 inhibitor, AG490. Moreover
, the level of 3-nitrotyrosine protein nitrosylation was
increased in cortical neurons transfected with IL-6R- or 
gp130-specific siRNA. This result indicates that IL-6R is
involved in the ROS regulation system through upregulation
of STAT3 and Mn-SOD.
IL-6 Recovers STAT3 Recruitment to the
Mn-SOD Promoter in Ischemic Reperfusion
To confirm whether IL-6R regulates STAT3-induced transcriptional
activity of the Mn-SOD promoter, we first examined
recruitment of STAT3 by IL-6 to the mouse Mn-SOD
promoter using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. As
shown in Figure 4A, STAT3 was strongly recruited to the
Mn-SOD promoter in chromatin from sham-operated mouse
brain cortices, and this recruitment was completely blocked
after reperfusion after tFCI. However, IL-6 injections reinstated
the recruitment of STAT3 into the Mn-SOD promoter.

blocked the recruitment of STAT3 into the Mn-SOD promoter
(Figure 4B).
Decreased Transcriptional Activity of the Mn-SOD
Promoter by Knockdown of the IL-6R Component
in Cerebral Cortical Neurons
Using a luciferase assay, we investigated transcriptional
activity of the Mn-SOD promoter in cerebral cortical neurons
transfected with IL-6R- or gp130-specific siRNA. As shown
in Figure 4C, inhibition of IL-6R or gp130 by transfection
with each specific siRNA significantly decreased luciferase
activity in cortical neurons transfected with pGLu-Mn-SOD.
In contrast, treatments with IL-6 significantly increased
luciferase activity.
Cell Death by Knockdown of IL-6R in Cerebral
Cortical Neurons
Our results indicate that IL-6R is the upstream regulator in
STAT3-mediated Mn-SOD expression in cerebral cortical
neurons. This may indicate that sustaining IL-6R at active
status is critical for neuronal survival against oxidative stress
in cerebral ischemic injury. Thus, we measured cell death by
IL-6R inhibition in cerebral cortical neurons. Lactate dehydrogenase
release significantly increased from cortical neurons
transfected with IL-6R- or gp130-specific siRNA for
24 hours (Figure 5A). To confirm whether this cell death was
caused by reduction in Mn-SOD, we measured cell death by
IL-6R inhibition in cerebral cortical neurons from SOD2/
heterozygous knockout mice. As shown in Figure 5B, there
was no significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release
in the cortical neurons transfected with IL-6R- or gp130-
specific siRNA for 24 hours in the SOD2/ group, which
expressed less Mn-SOD compared with the cortical neurons
of WT mice. These results support Mn-SOD as the final
target of IL-6R for neuronal survival through the ROS
defense system in cerebral cortical neurons.
IL-6 Reduces Infarct Volume in the
Ischemic Brain
To confirm the neuroprotective effect of IL-6 in vivo, we
injected IL-6 into mouse brains before and after middle
cerebral artery occlusion and measured infarction volume
after 24 hours of reperfusion. The infarct volumes in the
IL-6-treated mice were significantly smaller (P0.05, n9
per group) than in the vehicle-treated mice using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride staining (Figure 5C–D).
Discussion
This study has clearly elucidated the mechanism of neuroprotection
by IL-6 through the IL-6R-mediated ROS defense
system in mouse cerebral cortex and cortical neurons. Injections
of IL-6 restored the signal transduction of STAT3-
mediated Mn-SOD expression through recovery of the IL-6R
association, which had been blocked by reperfusion after
cerebral ischemia (Figures 1 and 4) and finally protected
neuronal cells against oxidative stress (Figure 5). IL-6R was
disrupted through a disassociation between IL-6R and
gp130 caused by reperfusion after cerebral ischemia (Figure
1). This disruption was the result of the oxidation of each
component of IL-6R by a direct and acute influx of oxygen
during reperfusion after ischemia (Figure 2). However, in
SOD1 TG mice, the disassociation between IL-6R and
gp130 by reperfusion was attenuated compared with SOD1
WT mice (Supplemental Figure IVD). Injection of IL-6 saved
each component of IL-6R from protein oxidation during
reperfusion after ischemia (Figure 2). To explain why IL-6
blocks protein oxidation by reperfusion in cerebral ischemic
injury, further study is needed. There are some reports that
IL-6 upregulates antioxidants.17,18 Thus, IL-6 may accelerate
gene expression or antioxidant activity that can block protein
oxidation against oxidative stress in the ischemic brain. Also,
IL-6 may play a role as an antioxidant molecule in an indirect
way. The direct binding of IL-6 to IL-6R at the cell surface
may serve as a shield from an attack of acute oxygen influx.

Disruption of IL-6R by transfection with IL-6- or gp130-
specific siRNA in cerebral cortical neurons significantly
increased superoxide radical production through Mn-SOD
reduction (Figure 3). This was caused by suppression of the
transcriptional activity of the Mn-SOD promoter through
blockage of STAT3 recruitment to the Mn-SOD promoter
(Figure 4). Moreover, disruption of IL-6R by transfection
with IL-6- or gp130-specific siRNA induced neuronal cell
death (Figure 5A). This cell death was caused by blockage of
the ROS defense system. In cortical neurons from SOD2/
knockout mice, cell death by transfection with IL-6- or 
gp130-specific siRNA was not increased compared with a
significant increase in cortical neurons from the SOD2 WT
mice (Figure 5B).
STAT3 is highly phosphorylated at Y705 in the mouse
brain and in cortical neurons under physiological conditions,
and p-STAT3 (Y705) upregulates Mn-SOD expression.11
However, STAT3 immediately lost its activity after reperfusion
in cerebral ischemic injury.11 Our present study explains
why this happens. The disassembly between IL-6R and
gp130 after ischemic reperfusion makes it impossible to
recruit STAT3 into the cytosolic domain of gp130, and then
STAT3 cannot be phosphorylated through sequential disruption
of JAK2 phosphorylation (Y1007/1008) and phosphorylation
of the cytosolic domain of gp130 (Figure 1C–D;
Supplemental Figure IC). However, injections of IL-6 restored
STAT3 activity through recovery of the IL-6R association
against ischemic reperfusion (Figure 1). Also, enhancement
of IL-6R by IL-6 recovered the pathway of
STAT3-mediated Mn-SOD expression and protected neuronal
cells against ischemic reperfusion (Figures 1, 4, and 5).
Injection of IL-6 significantly reduced infarct volume after 24
hours of reperfusion in the ischemic brain (Figure 5C–D),
although the limitations of the IL-6 effect should be considered
, because the protection afforded by it may be partially
lost with longer reperfusion. Thus, we suggest that IL-6 may
have therapeutic potential against oxidative stress such as
cerebral ischemic reperfusion and stroke.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL 
Primary Cortical Neuron Culture
The procedure was adapted from a previously described protocol.1 Cerebral cortical neurons 
were prepared from brains of 16-day-old mouse embryos. Cerebral cortices were isolated and the 
meninges were carefully removed, after which the tissue was minced and treated with 0.25% 
trypsin in Earle’s balanced salt solution for 1 minute. After centrifugation, cortical neurons were 
isolated and plated on coated dishes with poly-D-lysine, and cultured in minimum essential 
medium (Invitrogen) containing glucose, 5% horse serum, glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 
U/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Two days later, the medium was changed to neurobasal 
medium containing B-27. Neurons were used for each experiment 7-10 days after plating. 
OGD and Reoxygenation
For OGD in primary cortical neurons, the medium was replaced with buffered salt solution 
without glucose, and cortical neurons were placed in a gas-tight humidified anoxic chamber 
(PlasLabs) at 37C for 2.5 hours, after which the cell medium was changed to a neuronal 
medium with glucose and reoxygenated for 4 hours. 
IL-6 Treatment
IL-6 from mouse recombinant was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Two intracerebroventricular 
injections of IL-6 (50 ng in 2 l of PBS) were administered 30 minutes before and 15 minutes 
after MCAO because the half-life of IL-6 in the brain is short.2 Two treatments with IL-6 (50 
ng/ml) were also administered 30 minutes before and after OGD in primary cortical neurons.

Co-IP Assay
A Pierce CO-IP Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used for examination of the change in association 
between IL-6R and gp130 after 3 hours of reperfusion in whole cell extracts from cerebral 
cortices of male mice that were administered two intracerebroventricular injections of the vehicle 
(2 μl of PBS) or IL-6 (50 ng in 2 μl in PBS) 30 minutes before and 15 minutes after 45 minutes 
of MCAO. A Co-IP assay was also performed for analysis of the association between IL-6R
and gp130 after 4 hours of reoxygenation in whole cell extracts from cerebral cortical neurons 
that were administered two treatments of the vehicle or IL-6 (50 ng/ml) before and after 2.5 
hours of OGD. A general procedure was followed using the manufacturer's guidelines. Protein 
extracts were precipitated by an anti-IL-6R or an anti-gp130 antibody, and then immunoblotted 
by an anti-gp130 or an anti-IL-6R antibody. To be certain of the antibody specificity, protein 
extracts of sham samples were precipitated with anti-normal rabbit IgG (a negative control), and 
then immunoblotted with an anti-gp130 antibody or an anti-IL-6R antibody. To analyze for 
recruitment of STAT3 to the cytosolic domain of gp130, protein extracts were precipitated with 
anti-p-STAT3 (Y705) and then immunoblotted with an anti-gp130 antibody. 
Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy
Anesthetized animals were perfused with heparinized (10 U/ml) saline and subsequently with 4% 
formaldehyde in PBS after 3 hours of reperfusion following tFCI. After fixation of brain tissue 
for 24 hours, the brains were sectioned at 50 m using a vibratome and were washed three times 
with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). After using a TBS-blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 
0.2% skim milk, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) for 1 hour, the sections were incubated 
overnight in primary antibodies in TBS-blocking solution on a shaker at 4°C. The primary 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.94583010)

antibodies we used were rabbit anti-IL-6R  (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse antigp130
(1:100; R&D Systems). After washing three times, the sections were incubated in 
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa dyes (1:250; Invitrogen) for 2 hours. The sections 
were mounted and covered with mounting medium containing 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(Vector Laboratories) and were imaged on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). 
Detection of Protein Oxidation
An OxyBlotTM protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon International) was used for 
examination of direct oxidative injury to proteins. A general procedure was followed using the 
manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) reacted specifically with the 
oxidized carbonyl residue on the oxidized protein samples. The DNP-derivatized protein samples 
were immunoprecipitated using an anti-DNP antibody, and then immunoblotted using an anti-IL-
6R antibody, an anti-gp130 antibody, or an anti-STAT3 antibody. 
siRNA Transfection
We obtained siRNA probes targeted to mouse IL-6R or gp130, and non-targeting siRNA for 
use as a control (Qiagen). The target sequences for the mouse-specific IL-6R siRNA mixture 
were as follows: ACGAAGCGTTTCACAGCTTAA (SI00193774), 
CAGCTTCGATACCGACCTGTA (SI00193788), CAGTACGAAAGTTCTACAGAA 
(SI02690478), CCCGGCAGGAATCCTCTGGAA (SI02737336). The target sequences for the 
mouse-specific gp130 siRNA mixture were as follows: ACGACTTAGGACTATCTTAAA 
(SI00193802), CCGCTTTCTTATAGTCACCTA (SI00193809), 
CTCCCTTTGCTCTAAGAGAAA (SI00183816), AAGAAACTGCTTATTATTGAA 
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.94583010)
STROKE/2011/626648 Supplemental Data / 4
(SI02712929). Non-targeting siRNA (SI03650318) was used as a control in all siRNA 
transfection experiments. Primary cortical neurons grown on 24-well plates (1  105 cells/well) 
or 6-mm dishes (1  106 cells/dish) were transfected with 10 nM siRNA per well with HiPerFect 
transfection reagent (Qiagen), and after 24 hours of incubation, were subsequently analyzed for 
various experiments. 
Western Blot Analysis
Whole cell extracts were obtained from the cerebral cortex and caudate putamen (except the 
hippocampus) or were obtained from primary cortical neurons. Briefly, whole cell protein 
extracts were run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene 
difluoride membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies for 24 hours at 4C, and then with 
secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were 
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against p-STAT3 (Y705), phospho-JAK2 (Y1007/1008) 
(1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 3-nitrotyrosine (1:1000; Exalpha Biologicals), -tubulin 
(1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich), IL-6R (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), gp130 (1:5000; Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-tyrosine (1:1000), and Mn-SOD (1:5000; Stressgen). The signal 
was then detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG with the use of a 
chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences). 
ChIP Assay 
Chromatin isolation from mouse brain tissue or mouse primary cortical neurons and a chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assay were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using a 
commercially available kit (EZ-ZymeTM Chromatin prep kit, EZ-ChIPTM; Millipore). After 
(DEMO VERSION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.865110938)

fixation of brain tissue with 1% formaldehyde, each soluble chromatin was digested using EZZyme
enzymatic cocktail and isolated. The diluted chromatin solution was precleared with 
protein G agarose/salmon sperm DNA/preimmune serum. The precleared chromatin solution was 
used for immunoprecipitation assays with a p-STAT3 antibody. After several washes, the 
antibody-protein-DNA complex was eluted from beads. After reversal cross-link incubation, 
protein and RNA were removed by proteinase K and RNase A. Purified DNA was subjected to 
polymerase chain reaction with primer-specific putative STAT3-binding sites up-stream of the 
transcriptional start site.3 The sequences of the polymerase chain reaction primers used were: 
forward, 5'-ACTCAGCCACTGCCTTCTGC-3', reverse, 5'-TGAGACTGGGGTTGCGGACT-3', 
or forward, 5'-AGTCCGCAACCCCAGTCTCA-3', reverse, 5'-
AAATTGGTAGAGGCCGCGTGCTT-3'. 
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay
Primary cortical neurons were cultured on 24-well plates at a density of 1  105/well and were 
transfected with 250 ng of pGLu-Mn-SOD promoter reporter DNA3 per well using 
Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). After 24 hours of transfection, the cells were treated with 50 
μΜ of AG490 or 10 nM of siRNA for IL-6R or 10 nM of siRNA for gp130 or non-targeting 
siRNA per well. Cells were incubated for 2 more days and subsequently analyzed for luciferase 
activity. A Gaussia Luciferase Assay kit (New England BioLabs) was used to detect Gaussia 
luciferase activity from cell culture supernatants, according to the protocol provided by the 
manufacturer. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate and were repeated at least five 
times.

Cell Death Assay
Cell viability of primary cortical neurons was quantified by a standard measurement of LDH 
release using an LDH assay kit (BioVision). The amount of extracellular LDH was measured in 
an aliquot of the medium overlying the cells following the manufacturer's guidelines. 
Determination of Infarction
After 24 hours of reperfusion following tFCI, the mice were killed and the brains were isolated 
and chilled in ice-cold PBS. They were then sliced coronally at 1-mm intervals. Individual slices 
were then incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH adjusted to 
7.4), followed by 3.7% formalin. The infarct area was quantified by Adobe Photoshop (Adobe 
Systems).
