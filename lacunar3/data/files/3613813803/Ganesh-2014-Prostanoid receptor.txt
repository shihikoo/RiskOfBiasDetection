Prostanoid Receptor EP2 as a Therapeutic Target
Miniperspective

ABSTRACT: Cycoloxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction is prevalent in a
variety of (brain and peripheral) injury models where COX-2 levels
correlate with disease progression. Thus, COX-2 has been widely explored
for anti-inflammatory therapy with COX-2 inhibitors, which proved to be
effective in reducing the pain and inflammation in patients with arthritis
and menstrual cramps, but they have not provided any benefit to patients
with chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease. Recently, two COX-2 drugs, rofecoxib and valdecoxib, were withdrawn
from the United States market due to cardiovascular side effects. Thus, future anti-inflammatory therapy could be targeted
through a specific prostanoid receptor downstream of COX-2. The PGE
2
receptor EP2 is emerging as a pro-inflammatory target
in a variety of CNS and peripheral diseases. Here we highlight the latest developments on the role of EP2 in diseases, mechanism
of activation, and small molecule discovery targeted either to enhance or to block the function of this receptor.
■ INTRODUCTION
Inflammation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many
chronic neurodegenerative1,2 and peripheral diseases.3−6 An
acute injury to the brain or to the body induces inflammatory
pathways as an immune response. Common features of
inflammation include upregulation of cytokines and chemokines
, activation of microglia (in the central nervous system) or
macrophages (in the periphery), induction of cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and oxidative
stress.1,2 All of these features are manifested in patients as well
as animal models of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease (AD),7,8 Parkinson’s disease (PD),9,10
epilepsy,11−14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),15 and
traumatic brain injury (TBI).16,17 The inflammatory features
are also evident in patients with other diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA),4 chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD),5 and inflammatory bowel diseases.3 Prolonged
activation of these inflammatory pathways results in a
secondary damage to the neighboring neurons in the brain and
to the cells and tissues in the body, exacerbating the disease
pathology. Thus, inhibition of inflammatory pathways with
small molecule inhibitors should provide benefit to patients by
reducing the severity of the diseases. It is important to note that
the inflammatory responses are critical for survival and
homeostasis. However, more than one inflammatory pathway
or mediator is activated simultaneously during and after an
injury to maintain homeostasis and aid in repair. There is also
cross-talk among some of these inflammatory mediators
(cytokines, iNOS, and COX-2). An important issue that is
often difficult to address is whether these inflammatory
mediators act independently or in concert to fight against
potential pathogens or clearing the debris from the tissue. As a
result, it will be ambitious to comprehend an anti-inflammatory
therapeutic agent that blocks a single inflammatory target or
pathway resulting in alleviation of an entire inflammatory
cascade without interfering with compensatory mechanisms.
However, such a therapeutic agent might mitigate the severity
of the inflammation and disease progression to some extent.
Nonetheless, small molecular agents that block a single
biological target such as COX-2, iNOS, cytokines, and glia
are currently being pursued by investigators for antiinflammatory therapy.
The cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) have
been widely explored for anti-inflammatory therapy.18 COX-1
is constitutively expressed throughout the body and is involved
in a range of physiological functions including cellular
homeostasis and protection of gastrointestinal integrity.19,20
COX-2 is rapidly induced or upregulated after a variety of
stimuli or injuries and remains upregulated in chronic
inflammatory diseases. Both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms
activate prostaglandin signaling (Figure 1). Several COX-1
selective inhibitors (aka nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs)) have been shown to produce on-target mediated
side effects, mainly gastrointestinal tract and renal toxicity.21 It
has been hypothesized that selective inhibition of COX-2 by
small molecules could potentially eliminate COX-1 mediated
toxicities because COX-2 is induced only upon an insult or
injury in inflamed joints and tissues.22,23 Thus, several selective
COX-2 inhibitors were discovered.24,25 For example, celecoxib
(Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and valdecoxib (Bextra) have
been clinically proven as anti-inflammatory and pain relievers
for chronic indications such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis.26,27 Surprisingly, although elevated levels of COX-2
were observed in AD patients and COX-2 levels were
correlated with progression of AD,28 COX-2 inhibitors and
NSAIDs have not shown any cognitive benefits to patients with
AD. The data suggest that COX-2 inhibitors could have an

adverse effect on AD pathogenesis.29,30 Moreover, chronic use
of COX-2 drugs like rofecoxib and valdecoxib for arthritis and
other diseases also resulted in adverse cardiovascular side effects
including myocardial infarction and stroke in a significant
number of patients.31 Consequently, rofecoxib and valdecoxib
were withdrawn from the USA market. These side effects could
impose severe restrictions on the future use of COX-2 drugs,
particularly for elderly patients with AD, who are already at
increased risk for heart disease. It was demonstrated that
inhibition of the prostanoid receptor IP, which is activated by
COX-2 derived prostaglandin PGI
2
(see Figure 1), is
responsible for myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis.32,33 Thus, future generations of anti-inflammatory therapy
should be directed to target specific prostaglandin synthases or
prostanoid receptors downstream of COX-2 rather than the
generic block of the entire COX-2 signaling cascade (Figure 1).
■ COX/PROSTANOID SIGNALING CASCADE
Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
acid into endoperoxide intermediate prostaglandin-H
2
(PGH
2
),
which is then transformed by a variety of cell specific
prostaglandin synthases to produce five prostaglandins
(PGD
2
, PGE
2
, PGF
2
, PGI
2
, and TXA
2
). These natural ligands
activate 11 different G protein-coupled prostanoid receptors
(DP1, DP2, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, FPα,β, IP, and TPα,β).34
These prostanoid receptors are differentially expressed in
various cells and tissues and show a physiological and
pathological role in a variety of conditions.35 On the basis of
structural and functional properties, these prostanoid receptors
are classified into three major groups. The first group, called
relaxant receptors, consists of DP1, EP2, EP4, and IP receptors
because they mediate smooth muscle relaxation through cyclic
AMP (cAMP) production. The second group, known as
contractile receptors, consists of EP1, FP, and TP receptors
because they induce smooth muscle contraction by intracellular
Ca2+ mobilization. The third group, known as inhibitory
receptors, has only two members (EP3 and DP2) that inhibit
the production of cAMP. Activation of the DP2 receptor has
been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels as well (Figure
1). Additional articles regarding the detailed description of
prostanoid receptor properties and function have been
published recently.34,36−38 Thus, in this perspective article, we
focus specifically on the EP2 receptor and the binding of the
natural ligand prostaglandin-E
2
(PGE
2
)39 (1) (Figure 4) and
synthetic analogues. Both a beneficial and deleterious role of
EP2 has been suggested in central nervous system (CNS) and
peripheral diseases by making use of EP2 knockout mouse
models and selective small molecular agonists and antagonists
developed for EP2 (see below).
■ EP2 RECEPTOR IS A TARGET FOR A VARIETY OF
CNS AND PERIPHERAL DISEASES: AN OVERVIEW
The EP2 receptor is widely distributed in the body.40 In the
brain, EP2 is expressed in the cerebral cortex, thalamus,
hypothalamus, spinal cord, hippocampus, and striatum.41,42 At
the cellular level, EP2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and
microglia.41,42 A significant body of evidence shows that the
EP2 receptor plays both protective and deleterious role in brain
injury models. EP2 activation by butaprost (aka TR497943)( 2)
(Figure 4) (a relatively selective EP2 agonist) protects neurons
from glutamate- and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in rat
hippocampal cultures in vitro.42,44 EP2 activation by 2 reduces
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated neurotoxicity in
primary neuronal cultures prepared from rat midbrain.45 An
EP2 selective allosteric potentiator TG3-95-146 (10) (Figure 4)
also displays a neuroprotective effect in vitro against NMDA-
induced excitotoxicity in rat cultures,46 indicating that EP2 is
involved in neuroprotection (see next section for neuroprotection
in EP2 knockout models).
In contrast to the above results, several studies indicate that
EP2 activation promotes inflammation and neurotoxicity in
chronic neurodegenerative disease models. For example,
deletion of EP2 receptors reduces the oxidative damage and
amyloid burden in a model of AD,47 attenuates neurotoxicity by
α-synuclein aggregation in a mouse model of PD,48 and
improves motor strength while extending the survival of ALS
mice (G93ASOD model).41 Mice lacking the EP2 receptor are
less prone to cerebral oxidative damage produced by the
activation of innate immunity.49 Microglia cultures from mice
lacking EP2 are less sensitive to neurotoxicity, indicating that
microglial EP2 is involved in paracrine neurotoxicity.50
Microglia lacking EP2 also show enhanced phagocytosis of
amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which are hallmarks of AD, and
initiate AD progression. Microglia lacking EP2 are also less
sensitive to neurotoxicity when activated by Aβ-peptides,51
suggesting that EP2 plays a key role in AD pathology. PGE
2
(1)
acting on EP2 and EP4 receptors mediates the production of
Aβ-peptides as EP2 knockout mice show reduced amounts of
Aβ peptides in the brain.52 Taken together, these data suggest
that EP2 exacerbates AD by maintaining high levels of Aβ
peptides. Furthermore, EP2 receptor activation increases
expression of iNOS, an enzyme that produces nitric oxide
(NO), which is converted into reactive nitrates and nitrites in
Figure 1. COX/prostaglandin signaling cascade. Arachidonic acid is
converted to PGG
2
and then to PGH
2
by both COX-1 and COX-2
enzymes. Cell specific synthases convert the intermediate PGH
2
into
prostaglandin ligands, which activate one or more G coupledprostanoid
receptors. There are four receptors, DP1, EP2, EP4, and
IP, which promote cAMP production. cAMP then activates PKA- and
Epac-signaling. COX-2 inhibitor (red) would block every prostanoid
receptor type, but an EP2 antagonist (blue) could block only one out
of 11 prostanoid receptors and may avoid COX-2 inhibition mediated
side effects.

cytokine activated astrocytes,53 creating an environment for
oxidative stress that has been shown to damage the brain tissue.
EP2 receptors are also widely distributed in the periphery.
For example, EP2 is highly expressed in retinal tissue, dendritic
cells, endometriotic cells, skin epidermis, and in a variety of
cancer cells.54−56 Studies also indicate that EP2 plays protective
and deleterious roles in the peripheral disease models. EP2
activation by a selective agonist ONO-AE1-259-0157 (5)
(Figure 4) in a rat model of retinal degeneration increases
the retinal arteriolar diameter and fundus blood flow and also
prevents NMDA induced exitotoxic injuries to rat retina,
suggesting that EP2 plays a role in the regulation of ocular
hemodynamics.58,59 An EP2 agonist CP-53353660 (7) (Figure
4) has been shown to accelerate bone healing in a preclinical
canine model of bone fracture.60−62 EP2 activation by 1 also
improves renal function in an HgCl
2
model of renal failure63
and survival of epithelial cells after radiation injury.64
EP2 activation exacerbates symptoms of experimental
inflammatory bowel disease (colitis) by increasing IL-23
expression and reducing both IL-12 and IL-27, causing T-
cells to differentiate to Th17 effectors (Figure 2).55,65
Activation of EP2 also mediates joint inflammation in a
mouse model of collagen induced arthritis.66 EP2 has been
suggested to function in UV-induced skin inflammation, where
loss of EP2 significantly reduces inflammatory cell infiltration
into the local skin and local blood flow after UV exposure.67
EP2 has also been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis by
enhancing endothelial cell motility and opposing apoptosis68,69
and mediating epidermal growth and tumor formation in
response to UV radiation70 or chemical carcinogenesis.56 PGE
2
promotes survival of human endometriotic cells through EP2
and EP4 receptors by activating multiple cell survival signaling
pathways. Selective or combined inhibition of EP2 and EP4
receptors impairs these survival pathways and activates intrinsic
apoptotic pathways, thereby promoting apoptosis of human
endometriotic cells, indicating the potential of nonestrogenic
therapy for the treatment of endometriosis in women using an
EP2 inhibition strategy.54
■ EP2 AGONISM AND ANTAGONISM FOR DRUG
DISCOVERY
The above overview of results indicates the pleotrophic nature
of the EP2 receptor in the CNS and periphery, thus rendering it
as a potential target for medicinal chemistry approaches to
discover treatments for a variety of disease indications (Figure
3). The results also suggest that EP2 receptors play a context
dependent protective and deleterious role. Thus, both EP2
agonistic and antagonistic strategies may be applied for
therapeutic intervention, depending upon the disease and the
role played by EP2 in that setting. So far, there is no small
molecule agent that either activates or inhibits this G proteincoupled
receptor that is approved for clinical use in patients.
However, recent preclinical data using a selective EP2 agonist
in ischemic stroke and glaucoma models, an EP2 antagonist in
seizure and status epilepticus models, suggests that EP2
modulators (agonists and antagonists) should be explored
aggressively in the clinical setting.
EP2 Agonism for Stroke. Stroke affects about 800000
Americans each year. Treatment and disability for ischemic
cerebral injury is estimated to cost about 73 billion/year (Heart
Disease and Stroke Statistics; American Heart Association, 2013,
Update). So far, a significant number of neuroprotective agents,
which have been shown to be effective in preclinical models,
failed to show efficacy in patients in clinical studies.71 Thus
activation of the EP2 receptor may provide neuroprotective
benefits to stroke patients. McCullough et al.42 and Liu et al.72
have demonstrated that mice lacking EP2 show a significantly
larger infarct size and larger stroke volumes compared to wildtype
control mice in models of both transient and permanent
focal ischemia, with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
However, both EP2 knockout and wild-type mice show similar
physiological parameters and vascular anatomy.42,72 Independently
, Ahmad et al.73 also demonstrated that mice lacking EP2
show higher neurologic deficit scores and larger infarct sizes
than those of wild-type controls after MCAO (transient- and
permanent-middle cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO and
pMCAO). Importantly, an injection of a selective EP2 agonist
5 (Figure 4) (1−2 nM) into the right lateral ventricle of mice
prior to tMCAO displayed fewer neurologic deficits and smaller
hemispheric infarct volumes in the brain compared to mice
injected with only vehicle.73 Moreover, Serrano et al.74 have
shown that a single injection of butaprost free acid75 (3)
(Figure 4) immediately after termination of status epilepticus
shows about 50% neuroprotection in the hippocampal CA1.
These groups have chosen to administer EP2 agonists, either 3
or 5, directly into the lateral ventricle. Although this is not the
Figure 2. PGE
2
via EP2 receptor stimulates the differentiation of Th0
to Th17, which exacerbates the disease progression and severity in
peripheral diseases such as arthritis and IBD. Additional EP2 signaling
is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 3. EP2 receptors are involved in a variety of CNS and
peripheral diseases. EP2 receptors shown to play a protective role in
models of stroke, bone fracture, and glaucoma, but mouse models of
cancer, endometriosis, AD, PD, ALS, arthritis, and IBD suggest EP2
promotes inflammatory cascade or exacerbates disease pathology.
Thus EP2 may be targeted for discovery of therapeutics for these
diseases.

method of choice for the dosing of a drug to patients, given the
poor brain penetration properties of these carboxylic acids, this
method of administration may be justified. Thus, it is also
possible that bolus dosing of an EP2 agonist early on could
potentially saturate and desensitize the EP2 receptors by
internalization, as described before for other receptors76−78 and
negatively regulate the deleterious functions of the receptor,
leading to a net neuroprotective effect. However, Desai et al.,79
showed that 1 μM 1 (about 500-fold higher concentration than
its EC
50
for EP2) for 0−60 min does not internalize EP2
receptors expressed on 293-EBNA cell line, but in comparison,
the same dose of 1 internalizes EP4 receptors by 40%. In the
study involving an ischemic stroke model,73 the EP2 agonist 5
was dosed to produce cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) concentrations
of only 1−2 nM, a concentration at its EC
50
for the EP2
receptor (see Table 1). It is less likely that EP2 receptors are
desensitized in this situation. However, in a mouse model of
status epilepticus, Serrano et al., used butaprost free acid 3 at
concentration about 3-fold higher than its EC
50
for EP2.74 In
this case, there is a possibility of receptor desensitization.
Overall, the very weak internalization tendency of EP2
receptors in vitro,77,79 in conjunction with results from mice
lacking EP2 receptors,42 rule out the possibility of receptor
desensitization is the cause of beneficial effects in the stoke
models73,74 and provide a rationale for using EP2 activation as
an attractive strategy for a neuroprotection therapy in ischemic
stroke patients by using a highly selective, orally available, brain
penetrant EP2 agonist. Whether the animal models of tMCAO
and pMCAO, as well as pilocarpine induced status epilepticus
discussed here,42,72−74 are relevant to the human disease or
whether they will translate into the clinical setting is beyond the
scope of this review.
EP2 Agonism for Ocular Disease. Treatments for
lowering intraocular pressure with hypotensive agents that
antagonize β2-adrenergic receptors, or agonize α2-adrenergic
receptors and prostanoid receptor FP are currently marketed.80,81 Recent studies from Pfizer, using an EP2 agonist
taprenepag isopropyl (PF-04217329)82 (9) (Figure 4), suggest
EP2 as an attractive target for open-angle glaucoma and ocular
hypertension therapy. Compound 9 (a prodrug of CP-
54432682 (8)) has been shown to control intraocular pressure
in preclinical models of rabbit, dog, and monkey.82 Moreover,
this compound has been investigated in a phase 2 clinical trial
of 28 days of monotherapy, where it significantly reduced
intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and
ocular hypertension.83,84 Because of the poor aqueous solubility
of 9, it was formulated with a surface active ingredient (1%
Tween-80, 5% Cremophor-L, and 0.02% benzalkonium
chloride in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 5.5) as an ophthalmic
solution. This compound, at a concentration of 0.0025−0.03%,
produced benefits comparable to a 0.005% latanoprost solution
(a current standard of care) in reducing intraocular pressure in
patients.83,84 A point to note is that topical administration of an
EP2 agonist, like 9, is unlikely to be efficacious in treating other
CNS and peripheral diseases. Although it is unknown whether
systemic administration of an EP2 agonist will cause
hypotension, EP2 knockout mice and mice injected with an
EP2 agonist (by intracerebroventricular route) after MCAO
have shown no differences in mean arterial cerebral blood flow
in comparison to control mice.42,73 Nonetheless, long-term oral
treatment with an EP2 agonist may cause hypotension as a side
effect.
EP2 Antagonism for Neurodegenerative Disease.
Chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases such as
epilepsy, AD, PD, and ALS contribute to the mortality and
morbidity of a significant fraction of the population in the USA.
AD and PD are particularly associated with dementia symptoms
in the elderly. However, all of these diseases share a common
feature of overactivated inflammatory pathways.1,2,7 Interestingly
, PGE
2
is a major prostaglandin produced during the
progression of these diseases and has been shown to mediate
proinflammatory functions via EP2 (and to a lesser extent by
EP4) receptors. Recently, Jiang et al.,85 have shown that
administration of a potent and selective EP2 antagonist, TG4-
15585 (12) (Figure 4), substantially blocks neuronal damage in
the hippocampus (>60% in the hilus, 80% in the CA3, and
>90% in the CA1 region) in a pilocarpine model of status
epilepticus. Jiang et al.,86 also showed that another potent EP2
antagonist, TG6-10-186 (13) (Figure 4), suppresses neurodegeneration
, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, and activation of glia in mice following status
epilepticus, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit for an
EP2 antagonist to block epileptogenesis. On the basis of
beneficial effects observed in EP2-knockout mouse models of
AD, PD, and ALS (vide supra),41,47,48 a potent and highly
selective EP2 receptor antagonist may show utility as an adjunct
therapeutic agent for chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative
diseases including epilepsy, AD, PD, and ALS.
■ EFFECTS OF EP2 DELETION IN ANIMAL MODELS
Creation and use of EP2 genetic knockout models provided a
wealth of information regarding the function of EP2 receptor in
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. However, it is
important to note that EP2 knockout mice exhibited significant
cognitive and social memory deficits, impaired spatial learning
and prepulse inhibition, and heightened anxiety, suggesting an
association between the EP2 receptor and long-term hippocampal
depression and learning and memory.87,88 The loss of
EP2 also has functional ramifications for reproduction, as EP2-
lacking mice have decreased ovulation number and fertilization
rate compared to wild-type mice, and EP2 null females produce
lower than normal litter sizes.89 Other functional roles of EP2
identified by genetic manipulation studies in pregnant EP2
mice include arterial dilatation, salt-sensitive hypertension
during pregnancy, and reduced female fertility.90 Reports
such as these may have contributed to the paucity in
antagonistic drug discovery approaches for this receptor.
However, it is unlikely that these developmental compromises
will be observed with small molecule inhibitors. Thus, use of a
highly specific EP2 receptor antagonist for longer periods of
time may provide a definitive answer to whether EP2
antagonism has a therapeutic advantage in comparison to
genetically manipulated mice.
■ EP2-DOWNSTREAM MECHANISMS OF ACTION
A significant body of evidence suggests that EP2 activates
downstream signaling either by a G protein-coupled or by G
protein-independent mechanism.91−95 As shown briefly in 
Figure 5, activation of EP2 by PGE
2
stimulates adenylate
cyclase (via Gαs) resulting in cAMP, which mediates events
either through protein kinase A (PKA)95 or exchange protein
activated (Epac).96,97 PKA activates transcription factors such
as cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which is
involved in neuronal survival and neurogenesis.98,99 Epac

initiates downstream effectors Rap1/2 to regulate neuronal
differentiation, neuronal excitability, learning, memory, and
social interactions.100−102 It has been shown that there is crosstalk
between PKA and Epac and that PKA and Epac work
synergistically to activate CREB. However, more often they
work antagonistically. Generally, it is believed that PKA
activation is associated with neuronal survival, whereas Epac
activation leads to neuronal injury. EP2 also regulates other
downstream effectors independent of G protein-coupling via βarrestin
to promote or exacerbate disease conditions including
cancer proliferation and metastasis (Figure 3 and Figure 5).
Thus, EP2 is a complex target displaying pleotrophic roles
depending on the circumstances. For simplicity, only a few
downstream pathways are described here. However, it is
important to remember that some of the downstream effectors
shown in Figure 5 are also influenced by other G proteincoupled
receptors, like EP4.91−95
■ EP2 STRUCTURE AND BINDING SITE
The EP2 receptor belongs to the seven-transmembrane G
protein-coupled receptor family. Human EP2 encodes a protein
of 488 amino acids with a molecular mass of 53 kDa. The
amino acid sequence identity between human and mouse EP2
is 88%. The difference between these receptors is the presence
of an extra 25 amino acids at the NH
2
terminus of the mouse
EP2 protein and a difference of six consecutive amino acids in
the third extracellular loop. Despite these differences, the
pharmacological properties of human EP2 receptors are similar
to those of mouse EP2 receptors.40 Within the family of
prostanoid receptors, the amino acid identity is limited. The
identity of EP2 amino acids to EP1, EP3, and EP4 is in the
range of 20−30%. However, EP2 is more homologous to DP1,
with a structural identity of 44%, and then to the IP receptor
with 40% identity.103 No 3D structure of the EP2 receptor or
any other prostanoid receptor has yet been solved which might
provide details for the binding of small molecule (natural and
synthetic) EP2 modulators. However, the second extracellular
loop region has shown a highly conserved amino acid sequence
and it is presumed that the ligand-recognition site is located in
this region.34 So far, small molecule discovery (vide infra) has
been carried out only on the basis of intuitive ligand-based
design strategy.
■ IN VITRO BIOACTIVITIES OF EP2 AGONISTS AND
ANTAGONISTS
In comparison to other prostanoid receptors, relatively fewer
efforts have appeared toward discovery and development of
small molecule modulators of EP2.34,38 There are only two
classes of agonists currently available. Representative members
of these classes that are widely used and chemically optimized
are shown in Figure 4. Thefirst class of agonists is composed of
molecules that are structurally related to the endogenous ligand

by a competitive binding assay.75 The synthetic agonist 2
(butaprost) is about 63-fold less potent than 1, with an EP2 K
i
= 2400 nM. The agonist 2 is selective for EP2 over other
prostanoid receptors in receptor binding assays but was equally
effective in activating IP receptors in a functional assay (see
Table 1).75 In a separate study, 2 was shown to be only 3−4-
fold selective for EP2 over EP3 and EP4 receptors but very
selective against the IP receptor in binding assays.104 The ester
group of 2 is unstable and is expected to be cleaved
metabolically to produce acid 3 (Figure 4). The acid 3 is
more potent than 2, with an EP2 K
i
of 73 nM. By comparison,
3 is only 2-fold less potent than 1, however, the free acid 3 has
lost selectivity to EP2 binding over IP receptor binding (IP K
i
=
870 nM). In a potency assay, 3 showed nearly the same activity
for EP2 and IP receptors, with an EC
50
of 32 and 25 nM,
respectively (Table 1).75 The other agonist in the same class
represented as compound 457 (Figure 4) appears very selective
for the EP2 receptor over other prostanoid receptors. The
affinity of 4 to EP2 is nearly 10-fold higher than that of 1 and
20-fold higher than that of 3 (Table 1). However, in functional
assays, it has nearly the same potency as 1and roughly a 10-fold
higher potency than 3.57 Compound 4 is found to be unstable
as the free acid, but its stability is markedly improved when it is
converted to the lysine salt.57 Compound 5 shows a higher
binding affinity for EP2 (K
i
= 1.7 nM), a 22-fold higher affinity
than 1 and 42-fold higher affinity than 3. Compound 5 also
shows ∼700−1500-fold selectivity for EP2 over other
prostanoid receptors such as EP1, EP3, EP4, and IP.57 In a
functional assay, it has about an 18-fold higher potency than 2
and 3 (Table 1). The nonselective EP2 agonist AH-
13205105,106 (6) (Figure 4) is also a member of this class,
but because of its low potency it has not received much
attention.
The second class of EP2 agonists are pyridyl-sulfonamides.
Compound 7 is the initial lead compound in the class and has
high binding affinity to EP2 (K
i
= 50 nM) with high selectivity
for EP2 over other prostanoid receptors (16-fold selectivity
against DP1 and 50−60-fold selectivity against EP1, EP3, EP4,
and IP receptors).60 A related compound in this class, 8, also
displays high binding affinity to EP2 and at least a 270-fold
selectivity against EP1, EP3, and EP4 receptors. The potency of
8 is equal to 1 in a cAMP determination assay (Table 1).
Importantly, a prodrug of 8, taprenepag isopropyl (9) has been
developed as a clinical candidate (vide supra).83 The only class
of EP2-allosteric potentiators reported, represented by 10
(Figure 4), was developed recently at Emory University.
Compound 10 potentiates EP2 receptors with EC
50
= 7.8 μM
in a cAMP assay and also displays selective potentiation of EP2
receptors versus EP4 and β2-AR receptors.46 Allosteric

potentiators are designed to function in the presence of high
PGE
2
concentrations that are expected to be present during
tissue injury. Two drawbacks of these potentiators are that they
are weakly active and poorly water soluble for dosing into
animal models. However, 10 may be useful for in vitro
studies.46
The only EP2 antagonist widely used for probing the roles of
EP2 is AH-6809107 (11) (Figure 4). 11 is commercially
available, but it shows weak antagonistic activity (EP2 K
i
=
1150 nM) and very poor selectivity against other prostanoid
receptors such as EP1, EP3, and DP1 (Table 2).104 Recently,
Pfizer revealed the azetidine-carboxylic acid derivative PF-
04418948108 (15) (Figure 4) as the first of a new class of
selective EP2 antagonists, with an IC
50
of 16 nM and Schild K
B
of 1.8 nM (a concentration required to cause a 2-fold increase
of the EC
50
of PGE
2
).108 This antagonist exhibits >10000-fold
selectivity for the EP2 receptor over other prostanoid receptors
(i.e., EP1, EP3, EP4, DP1, and IP) (Table 2) and does not
show significant effects on a diverse panel of other GPCRs.108
However, brain penetration of this antagonist has not been
disclosed and thus it is unclear whether this compound could
be useful for in vivo evaluation in mouse models of CNS
disease. Nonetheless, 15 has been shown to attenuate
butaprost-induced vasodilatory blood flow in rats, demonstrating
that it has the requisite plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue
penetration to be useful as an in vivo probe for a variety of
peripheral diseases.108
Independently from Pfizer, Emory University identified a
novel cinnamic acid amide class of EP2 antagonists and has
investigated them for proof of concept in mouse models of
status epilepticus.85,86 These compounds are unique in 
structure and do not belong to any other class of agonists or
antagonists previously reported. Importantly, the Emory EP2
antagonists do not possess a carboxylic acid, which is intrinsic
to the majority of the EP2 agonists and antagonists discovered
thus far (Figure 4). Two representatives in this class of EP2
antagonists are 12 and 13, whose structures are shown in
Figure 4.85 The prototype compound 12 has an EP2 Schild K
B
of 2.4 nM and displays 550−4750-fold selectivity for EP2 over
EP1, EP3, EP4, and IP but only 14-fold selectivity against the
DP1 receptor (Table 2).85 Another lead compound in this class
of EP2 receptor antagonists is 13, which has an EP2 Schild K
B
of 17.8 nM and displays greater than 300-fold selectivity against
EP3, EP4, and IP receptors. Compound 13 shows a 100-fold
selectivity against EP1, FP, and TP receptors but only 10-fold
selectivity against the DP1 receptor.86 Moreover, 13 shows a
plasma half-life (t
1/2
) of 1.6 h and brain to plasma ratio of 1.6 in
mice. These two Emory compounds (12 and 13) did not show
significant off-target activity against a diverse panel of 47
enzymes and receptors including COX, NOS, PDE, adrenergic
receptors, serotonin receptors, and cytochrome P450 enzymes.
So far, 12 and 13 have only shown significant off-target activity
at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor with an IC
50
2.6 and 7.5 μM,
respectively.86,109 These IC
50
values far exceed their respective

values (1080-fold higher for 12, 420-fold higher
for 13). The data obtained thus far on these novel EP2 receptor
antagonists suggest that 13 may serve as a valuable probe for
proof of concept studies in CNS and other neurodegenerative
animal models where EP2 receptors may mediate deleterious
effects. Very recently, Emory university group discovered a
second class of antagonists that are carbamothioylacrylamides.110 A lead compound, TG6-129110 (14) (Figure 4),
displayed EP2 potency at low nanomolar concentrations (EP2
Schild K
B
= 8.8 nM). Unlike 12 and 13, compound 14 has
shown high selectivity against DP1 (1660-fold) and EP4 (440-
fold) receptors but only 22-fold selectivity against the IP
receptor. This compound did not cross the blood−brain
barrier, and thus it might be useful as a probe for a variety of
peripheral disease models shown in Figure 3.
■ EP2 ANTAGONISTS REPORTED IN PATENT
LITERATURE
Although very little bioactivity or biology is included in the
patent literature, a brief summary on patented EP2 antagonists
is presented due to the relatively limited number of chemical
scaffolds available so far. Two pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer
and Bayer Schering Pharma, have identified small molecule
antagonists for the EP2 receptor. Representative structures 16−
22 are illustrated in Figure 6. Pfizer has created 3-azetidine
carboxylic acids and 3-azetidine carboxamides (16−17) with
potent EP2 inhibition activity.111 Compound 15 (Figure 4,
Table 2) emerged as a lead compound from the general
structure 16. Bayer Schering Pharma has also developed four
distinct classes of antagonists represented by 18−21,112−115 but
in vivo data is not available for any lead structure from these
scaffolds 18−22. Emory University also created a class of
compounds represented by 22, which display potent EP2
antagonist activity116 from which 13 (Figure 4) has emerged as
a lead compound. Several compounds from each class (16−22)
show EP2 potency in the range of low nanomolar to low
micromolar level (Figure 6) and are available as backups for
development into therapeutically useful compounds. Because of
the large number of EP2 agonists published in the patent
literature and scholarly articles, they are not highlighted
here.122−125
■ CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS
PGE
2
is a major product of increased COX-2 activity in the
brain of rodents and human patients following various insults. It
activates four G protein-coupled receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and
EP4). EP2 receptor is expressed in various parts of the body
and brain and plays context-dependent, beneficial, and
deleterious roles. Thus, concerns are inevitable about whether
EP2 receptor is druggable with small molecules, and if so,
whether activation or inhibition is a better therapeutic strategy.
Recent studies with mouse models of ischemic stroke and
inflammatory neurodegenerative disease model of status
epilepticus (vide supra) suggest both agonism and antagonism
strategies may be explored for therapeutic development. Studies
also suggest that the cell type from which EP2 receptors
originate may affect the role of the receptor. For example, in the
brain, EP2 receptors are expressed in neurons and glia. Thus, it
is also possible that EP2 of neuronal origin may act, mainly
through PKA activation, in an autocrine fashion to protect
neurons from acute brain injury (as in stroke, or just after status
epilepticus). The signaling from dying neurons, in conjunction
with several other proinflammatory mediators produced during
acute brain injury, may activate EP2 receptors in microglia and
astrocytes, which, predominantly via the Epac activation
pathway, may exacerbate paracrine toxicity, leading to neurodegeneration.
Thus, as illustrated in Figure 7, an appropriate
therapeutic approach may be to use an EP2 agonist or an
allosteric potentiator immediately after brain injury to maximize
the beneficial effects. An alternative therapeutic strategy would
be to use an EP2 antagonist, starting several hours to days after
brain insult to break the glia-induced vicious inflammatory
cycle, as afirst line or adjunct therapeutic agent in patients with
neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy, AD, PD, TBI, and
ALS.
As recently described by Weiss et al.,117 it is not always true
that the phenotype of small molecular inhibitors of a target
mimics the phenotype of genetic knockout animals lacking the
same target. There are several receptors and enzymes including
a few kinases (e.g., Aurora B) known to show divergence. EP2
knockout mice were created many years ago and have been
used extensively to explore the role of EP2 in a variety of
disease models. However, EP2 receptor antagonists have been
reported recently and have been explored in limited neurodegenerative
disease models. Thus they should be examined for
on-target mediated effects on healthy mice during chronic
dosing (2−3 months) in order to characterize memory deficits,
fertility complications, formation, and loss of synapses in the
hippocampus (vide supra). This experiment would yield
valuable information to rule in or out whether an antagonism
of EP2 is therapeutically beneficial.
There are several highly characterized EP2 specific agonists
now available (Table 1) but a limited number of selective
antagonists (Table 2) that are useful for CNS and other disease
models. Other than steroids, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors,
currently, there is no other FDA approved anti-inflammatory
therapeutic agent available which works through a specific
inflammatory target. However, selective inhibitors of microsomal
prostaglandin-E-synthase (mPGES)118 and antagonists
of prostanoid receptor EP4119 are currently under preclinical
evaluation. These agents (mPGSE-1 and EP4 inhibitors) may
also alleviate some of the adverse side effects caused by COX-2
inhibitors. However, experiments designed to reduce inflammation
or neurodegeneration (or both) in chronic inflammatory
or neurodegenerative disease models (examples: arthritis,
Figure 7. Two potential therapeutic strategies that may be useful for
EP2 receptor mediated effects in the brain for neuroprotection and for
blocking the neurodegeneration.

AD, epilepsy) using COX-2, and EP2 or EP4 or mPEGS-1
selective inhibitors head-to-head, is worth pursuing.
Although the available EP2 agonists and antagonists are
selective for EP2 in binding and in vitro functional assays
(Table 1, 2), in vivo target-engagement studies120,121 are
lacking to ascertain whether the observed efficacy is mediated
through the binding of EP2 modulators to the receptor in vivo.
Demonstration of target engagement is a formidable task for
EP2 receptor and is complicated by the fact that there is no
specific biomarker produced solely by the EP2 receptor and
lack of available radiolabeled agonists or antagonists that
specifically bind to EP2 in vivo. Nonetheless, this study is very
important, and if target engagement can be demonstrated, it
will strengthen the published results and advance the EP2
receptor as a target for drug discovery.
