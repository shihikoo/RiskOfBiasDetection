SUMMARY
1. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors exert neuroprotection
in both cellular and animal models of ischaemic
stroke. However, which HDAC isoform (or isoforms) mediates
this beneficial effect has not yet been determined.
2. In the present study, gene levels of the HDAC isoforms
were determined in the mouse cortex using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), whereas changes
in the expression of individual zinc-dependent HDAC family
members were evaluated by western blotting, 3, 12, 24 and
48 h after cerebral ischaemia induced by transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion in male Kunming mice.
3. The HDAC isoforms HDAC1–11 were all expressed in
the mouse cortex and differentially affected by cerebral ischaemia.
Notably, there was a substantial increase in HDAC3,
HDAC6 and HDAC11 expression during the early phases of
experimental stroke, indicating their contribution to stroke
pathogenesis. Furthermore, induction of HDAC3 and HDAC6
in cortical neurons by ischaemic stroke was confirmed in vivo
and in vitro using double-labelled immunostaining and
RT-PCR, respectively. Therefore, small hairpin (sh) RNAs
were used to selectively knock down HDAC3 or HDAC6. This
knockdown appreciably promoted the survival of cortical
neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation.
4. The findings of the present study demonstrate the
expression patterns of HDAC isoforms during experimental
ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, HDAC3 and HDAC6 were
identified as potential mediators in the neurotoxicity of
ischaemic stroke, suggesting that specific therapeutic
approaches may be considered according to HDAC subtype.
Key words: histone deacetylase, neuroprotection, stroke.
INTRODUCTION
Protein function can be regulated by the enzymatic addition and
removal of acetyl groups at specific lysine residues. Lysine acetylation
is mediated by two classes of enzymes with opposing functions
: histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases
(HDACs). These enzymes catalyse the addition and removal of
acetyl groups.1 The HDAC isoforms are divided into four groups:
Class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8), Class IIa
(HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9), Class IIb (HDAC6 and
HDAC10) and Class IV (HDAC11).1,2 Although understanding of
the precise functions of individual HDAC isoforms in different
cell types and in different diseases is limited, emerging evidence
suggests that HDAC isoforms are involved in diverse biological
activities, including the cell cycle,3–5 differentiation,6 apoptosis,7,8
cellular stress and inflammation.9–18 Consequently, HDAC inhibitors
have been intensively investigated as potential therapies for
cancer and central nerve system (CNS) disorders.19–21
Ischaemic brain injury is thought to result from a cascade of
events ranging from energy depletion to cell death. Intermediate
factors include an excess of extracellular excitatory amino acids,
free radical formation and inflammation.22–25 Achieving therapeutic
efficacy in ischaemic stroke is one of the biggest challenges
in translational neurobiology. Accumulating experimental
data indicate that HDAC inhibition is a strategy capable of targeting
diverse pathophysiologies of stroke with a wide therapeutic
window.26 It has been reported that HDAC inhibitors significantly
decrease neuronal injury and improve functional outcome
in multiple preclinical models of focal ischaemia.19,27–31 However
, the enthusiasm for pan-HDAC inhibition in treating neurological
conditions is tempered by their toxicity towards a host of
CNS cell types.19,20,32 It may be possible to target a specific
HDAC isoform to elicit the beneficial effects of the HDAC inhibitor
strategy without the toxicity associated with global HDAC
inhibition. Hence, identification of the HDAC isoforms that specifically mediate the beneficial effects of pan-HDAC inhibition
and selective inhibition of specific HDAC or HDACs may be a
novel neuroprotective strategy for ischaemic stroke.
The present study examined changes in the expression of classical
HDAC isoforms after experimental ischaemic stroke in vivo
and in vitro with the aim of providing a basis for future research
into specific HDAC or HDACs-targeted treatment for ischaemic
stroke.

METHODS
Animals and ischaemic model
The animal study was conducted in accordance with the National
Regulations of Experimental Animal Administration (http://www.
lascn.net/policy/law/nationlaw/200805/14.html, accessed 1 April
2012) and all experimental procedures were approved by the
Committee of Experimental Animal Administration of Nanjing
University. Kunming male mice (25–30 g) were provided by the
Animal Centre of Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University
Medical School.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the
mouse was performed as described previously.33 Briefly, mice
were anaesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital (45 mg/kg,
i.p.). A midline cervical incision was made under a dissecting
microscope and the right common carotid artery and external carotid
artery (ECA) were isolated. A 6-0 monofilament nylon
suture with a heat-rounded tip was introduced into a wedgeshaped
incision on the ECA and advanced to obstruct the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. After 90 min occlusion, reperfusion
was initiated by filament withdrawal. Sham-treated mice were
subjected to the same procedure without MCAO. During the procedure
, rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C. The
mortality rate in this study was approximately 10%.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain
reaction
To analyse the mRNA levels of the HDAC isoforms after ischaemic
stroke, three to five mice in each of the sham and MCAO
groups were killed and cortical tissue was dissected from ipsilateral
hemispheres of mice subjected to 90 min MCAO followed by
3, 12, 24 and 48 h reperfusion. Total RNA was extracted using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and was transcribed
into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara,
Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal
amounts of cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). The PCR consisted of incubation for 5 min at 94°C
followed by 35 cycles of incubation at 94°C for 45 s, 57°C for
50 s and 72°C for 50 s. All samples were normalized against the
GAPDH loading control and then normalized against the sham
MCAO control for all semiquantitative comparisons. The primer
sequences for HDAC1–11 are listed in Table 1. The PCR products
were analysed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium
bromide. Gels were visualized using an ultraviolet transilluminator
and photographed. Quantification of digital images of DNA bands
was performed using spot densitometry software (Gel-Pro
Analyser 4.0; Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Western blotting
Tissue sampling was as described above for reverse transcription
–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blotting was performed
as described previously.33,34 Equal amounts of protein
samples were separated and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies
against HDAC1 (1 : 500; BioWorld Technology, St Louis
Park, MN, USA), HDAC2 (1 : 500; BioWorld Technology),
HDAC3 (1 : 500; BioWorld Technology), HDAC5 (1 : 500;
BioWorld Technology), HDAC6 (1 : 500; BioWorld Technology
) and HDAC11 (1 : 500; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
GAPDH (1 : 2000; BioWorld Technology) was used as a loading
control. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and

ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
and exposure to film. All samples were normalized against GAPDH
and then normalized against the sham control group for all
semiquantitative comparisons.
Immunostaining
Mice were perfused intracardially with fresh cold 0.9% saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain tissues were then dissected
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h followed by
immersion in 15% and 25% sucrose in 0.01 mol/L phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS). Cryostat sections (14 lm) were washed
twice in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% PBST (0.1%
TritonX-100 in 0.01 mol/L PBS) three times for 5 min each time.
Sections were incubated sequentially with the primary antibodies
for double immunofluorescent staining. Staining for HDAC3 and
HDAC6 was performed first at 4°C overnight with rabbit anti-
HDAC3 polyclonal antibody (1:50; BioWorld Technology) and
rabbit anti-HDAC6 polyclonal antibody (1:50; BioWorld Technology
), respectively. Sections were then washed in 0.1% PBST
three times for 5 min each time, followed by incubation with the
other primary antibodies against neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:100;
Millipore), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:100; BD Biosciences
, Sparks, MD, USA) and ionized calcium binding adaptor
molecule 1 (Iba1; 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Then,
samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY,
USA) and Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:100; Invitrogen) secondary antibodies at 37°C for 1.5 h in the
dark. Finally, slides were washed five times with 0.1% PBST and
4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to stain the cell nuclei
for 2 min at room temperature. After five washes in 0.1% PBST
for 5 min each time, the slides were mounted and covered. Images
were examined using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) TE200 microscope
with a Spot RT (Tokyo, Japan) digital camera.
Primary cortical neuron culture
Primary cortical neurons were cultured from E16–17 mouse
embryos as described previously.35 Briefly, fetal cortices were
dissected and treated with trypsin to prepare a cell suspension.
Cells were plated at a density of 59 105 cells/mL on 12- or 96-
well poly D-lysine-coated plates. Cells were grown in Neurobasal
medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 25 nmol/L
glutamine at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO
2
incubator.
Plasmid construct and transient transfection
Small hairpin (sh) RNAs were designed to target mouse HDAC3
or HDAC6 and subsequently cloned into pCMV-U6 vector using
Bbsl and BglII (Fermentas, Geln Bumie, MD, USA). A plasmid
expressing scrambled shRNA was used as a negative control.

The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Cortical
cultures were transfected 3 days after plating using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The transfection efficiency for the primary cortical neurons was
approximately 10% in our experiments. Cells were harvested
48 h after transfection for the determination of HDAC3 and
HDAC6 expression by RT-PCR or for oxygen–glucose deprivation
(OGD) treatment.
Oxygen–glucose deprivation
Cortical cultures were subjected to OGD to simulate ischaemia
in vitro.33 Briefly, cultures were switched from a normal culture
medium to an oxygen-depleted, glucose-free medium. Cells were
incubated in a hypoxia chamber flushed previously for 15 min
with 5% CO

at 13.8 kPa. Valves were closed and he
chambers were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Then, cells were
returned to normal culture conditions for later treatment.
3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide assay
Following the treatment described above, neuronal viability was
determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, the cell culture medium
in 96-well plates was aspirated and replaced with fresh neuron
feeding medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT for 4 h at 37°C. The
formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 lL dimethylsulphoxide
and the absorbance was measured using an ELISA plate reader
(TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). Cell survival rates were
expressed as a percentage of the value of cells transfected with
control shRNA but without OGD treatment (normal controls).
In addition, propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to assess
cell apoptosis using a commercially available kit (Cell Apoptosis
PI Detection Kit; KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China). After treatment
, cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol for > 12 h.
The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL Buffer A containing
0.25 mg/mL RNase A for 30 min at 37°C and then incubated for
30 min at 37°C in the dark after the addition of 5 lL PI. The
number of PI-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry.

P < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed
using SIGMASTAT 11.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
Effects of cerebral ischaemia on HDAC1–11 mRNA is
expression in mouse cortex
To investigate the expression of HDAC1–11 in normal mouse
cortex, mRNA levels were determined by semiquantitative RTPCR.
As shown in Fig. 1a, each of the classical HDAC family
members was expressed in the normal mouse cortex at different
levels. Highest expression was noted for HDAC2 and HDAC5,
followed by HDAC11 and HDAC4. The lowest expression was
noted for HDAC9 and HDAC10.
To determine which of the HDACs may be a target for neuroprotection
, the expression levels of each of the HDAC isoforms
was evaluated during ischaemia–reperfusion in a mouse MCAO
model. Diverse expression of HDAC isoforms was seen after
acute cerebral ischaemia. Stroke induced progressive decreases in
cortical mRNA levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC5 and HDAC9,
with most significantly reductions (by 45.6%, 58.1%, 96.7% and
41.0%, respectively; P < 0.05) seen 48 h after MCAO. A transient
increase was seen in HDAC3 mRNA levels after 24 h reperfusion
(upregulated by 22%; P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of
HDAC6 and HDAC11 were significantly increased in MCAO
mice after 3 h reperfusion (by 35.9% and 60.9%, respectively;
both P < 0.05), but then started to decrease, with a substantial
decline seen after 24 h reperfusion compared with that in shamtreated
mice (by 32.6% and 81.2%, respectively; P < 0.05).
In contrast, cerebral ischaemia had no significant effect on
HDAC4 and HDAC8 mRNA levels (Fig. 1b; see also Fig. S1,
available as Supplementary Material for this paper).
Based on the basal and stroke-induced dynamic expression patterns
, HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC5 (high basal expression that
was reduced after ischaemic stroke) and HDAC3, HDAC6 and
HDAC11 (early stoke-induced upregulation in the ischaemic cortex
) were selected for further immunoblotting analysis.
Stroke-induced changes in HDAC expression in the ischaemic
cortex
To validate the mRNA expression data, immunoblotting experiments
were performed on total protein lysates from ischaemic and
non-ischaemic mouse cortex. As shown in Fig. 2 (and Fig. S2),
HDAC1 and HDAC2 levels were downregulated in a time-dependent
manner after acute cerebral ischaemia, in accordance with the
changes in mRNA levels. Expression of HDAC5 was time-dependently
downregulated after 3 h reperfusion and was reduced by
97.3% at 48 h. Notably, early increases in HDAC6 and HDAC11
expression were also observed at 3 h, but these decreased with time
and expression of HDAC6 and HDAC11 was significantly reduced
after 24 h reperfusion (by 32.7% and 82.3%, respectively) and
48 h reperfusion (by 53.8% and 20.2%, respectively). However, in
contrast with the findings regarding HDAC3 mRNA expression,
there were no increase in HDAC3 expression at the protein level.

the ischaemic mouse cortex was confirmed by immunostaining,
based on expression levels demonstrated above (Figs 1,2) and
information in the literature.11,32,36 Distinct expression of
HDAC3 and HDAC6 was seen in the ischaemic cortex of
MCAO mice 24 and 3 h after reperfusion, respectively. In addition
, double labelling was used to identify the cell types in which
HDAC3 and HDAC6 were expressed. Sections were treated with
antibodies against HDAC3 and HDAC6 and selected cell type
markers: antibodies were used to identify neurons (anti-NeuN),
astrocytes (anti-GFAP) and microglia (anti-Iba1). Both HDAC3
and HDAC6 were predominantly found in neurons, with HDAC3
detected predominantly in the nuclear compartment in cortical
neurons of MCAO mice, whereas HDAC6 was located in the cell
bodies of most neurons in the cortex (Fig. 3). No colocalization
of HDAC3 or HDAC6 was observed in astrocytes or microglia
(data not shown).
Effects of targeted knockdown of HDAC3 or HDAC6 on
ischaemic injury in vitro
To investigate whether enhanced levels of HDAC3 and HDAC6
were correlated with neurotoxicity in ischaemic stroke, we first
confirmed the expression patterns of HDAC3 and HDAC6 in cortical
neurons subjected to OGD, a cellular model simulating
ischaemic injury. As expected, the expression of both HDAC3
and HDAC6 increased with time after OGD. As shown in
Fig. 4a,b, HDAC3 mRNA expression in cortical neurons started
to increase 3 h after OGD and was increased even further 24 h
after OGD. In contrast, pronounced augmentation of HDAC6 was
observed in cortical neurons as early as 15 min after OGD,
which peaked at 3 h and then declined significantly by 24 h after
OGD. These results were further confirmed by western blotting
analysis (Fig. 4c,d).
To validate our hypothesis that selective HDAC inhibition may
exert neuroprotection in experimental ischaemic stroke, we used
an shRNA approach to specifically knockdown HDAC3 or
HDAC6. Transfection of cortical neurons with HDAC3 or HDAC6
shRNA resulted in the knockdown of HDAC3 or HDAC6 mRNA
(Fig. 5a). Selective inhibition of HDAC3 expression led to a moderate
increase in neuronal viability (by 8.3%; P < 0.05), whereas
inhibition of HDAC6 appeared more effective in promoting neuronal
survival (by 26.7%; P < 0.05) 3 h after OGD (Fig. 5b). In
addition, inhibition of HDAC3 or HDAC6 significantly decreased
the late apoptotic rate of neuronal cells subject to OGD
(P < 0.05; Figs 5c,S3).
DISCUSSION
The present study represents the first known expression analysis
identifying the HDAC subtypes involved in acute ischaemic
stroke. The investigation was based on studies showing that histone
hypoacetylation is associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative
conditions, including cerebral ischaemia.19 Treatment
with HDAC inhibitors can correct the imbalance of acetylation
and exert neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegenerative
diseases,19,31,37 suggesting the existence of neurotoxic
members in the HDAC family. The present study confirms that
all HDAC isoforms are expressed in the mouse cortex and that
they are differentially induced by experimental ischaemic stroke,
congruent with the diverse biological functions of the HDAC
family members.5,32,38,39 In addition, it is interesting to note that
significant increases were seen in the expression of HDAC3,

HDAC6 and HDAC11 after acute ischaemic stroke, suggesting
that these HDAC isoforms are probably stroke regulated or implicated
in pathological signalling.
Histone deacetylase 3 is a member of the Class I histone
deacetylase family that regulates gene expression by deacetylation
of histones and non-histone proteins. Histone deacetylase 3
activity has been shown to be modulated by its interaction with
the corepressers nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and
silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors
(SMRT) to maintain chromatin structure and genomic stability.40
In addition, HDAC3-dependent transcriptional repression of
c-Jun plays a role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis.41 In
the present study, experimental stroke induced a substantial
increase in HDAC3 expression in the mouse transient MCAO
model. Similar expression patterns of HDAC3 were seen in cortical
neurons subjected to OGD. Accordingly, we surmised that
upregulation of HDAC3 may mediate deleterious effects in
ischaemic stroke. Thus, HDAC3 shRNA was used to specifically
knockdown HDAC3 expression, which resulted in enhanced neuronal
viability. These findings are consistent with recent observations
that identified HDAC3 as a protein with neurotoxic
activity.32 In that study, it was found that forced expression of
HDAC3 induced the death of rat neurons, whereas inhibition of
its expression protected against low potassium-induced neuronal
death.32 These findings define HDAC3 as a potential neurotoxic
mediator and probably a candidate for selective HDAC inhibition
in the treatment of stroke.
Histone deacetylase 6, a Class IIb HDAC, is actively maintained
and functions predominantly in the cytoplasm. It is
regarded as a unique HDAC member, harbouring two catalytic
domains and a C-terminal domain that binds both polyubiquitylated
misfolded proteins and the dynein motor.38,42–44 The present
study demonstrated that experimental ischaemic stroke led to
an early induction of HDAC6 both in vivo and in vitro. Previous
studies have defined HDAC6 as a critical regulator of protective
cell responses to cytotoxic assaults, during which HDAC6 serves
as both a sensor and an effector of stressful stimuli and mediates
appropriate cell responses.11 Simultaneous binding of HDAC6 to
polyubiquitin chains in the aggregates and to the dynein motors
mediates the transport of these aggregates, the formation of an
aggresome and their autophagic degradation.45,46 In addition,
HDAC6 senses proteasome dysfunction and activates heat shock
transcription factor (HSF) 1 transcription factors, leading to the
accumulation of the major chaperones heat shock protein (HSP)
70 and HSP27.47 Furthermore, in Drosophila models of neurodegenerative
disease, HDAC6 was identified as a genetic modifier
of polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration.48 It may be possible
to intervene in neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to
enhance autophagy, which facilitates degradation of potentially
noxious protein substrates and contributes to neuroprotection.48,49
In contrast with these findings, emerging evidence reveals neurotoxic
effects of HDAC6 in oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration.
For example, HDAC6 was induced in neurons subjected
to oxidative stress and selective inhibition of HDAC6 promoted
neuronal survival and regeneration.36 Inhibition of HDAC6
increased cellular anti-oxidant activity and protected against oxidative
insults by acetylating peroxiredoxin-1 and -2 and increasing
resistance to superoxidation.50 Given these observations,
HDAC6 appears to be a key stress regulator and is probably
implicated in stroke development. Therefore, the roles of
HDAC6, whether neuroprotective or neurotoxic, were further
investigated in the present study and it was found that selective
inhibition of HDAC6 significantly promoted neuronal survival
after ischaemic injury, indicating that HDAC6 could be a prospective
target for neuroprotective strategies in ischaemic stroke.
In addition, it is interesting to note that HDAC6 may be involved
in stroke development in a different way to HDAC3, based on

the discrepancy between HDAC3 and HDAC6 expression patterns
and effectiveness of promoting neuronal survival. Further
studies are underway to identify the potential molecules or pathways
that are associated with the neurotoxic effects of HDAC3
or HDAC6 in ischaemic stroke.
Histone deacetylase 11 is the most recently described of the
Class IV HDAC and contains conserved residues in the catalytic
core regions shared by both Class I and Class II HDAC members.
Histone deacetylase 11 is localized predominantly to the
cell nucleus and may be present in protein complexes with
HDAC6.2 Histone deacetylase 11 plays a role in CNS histone deacetylation
and is correlated with the development of oligodendrocytes
and neurons during postnatal development.51 In the
present study, we found that HDAC11, similar to HDAC6, was
significantly upregulated after 3 h reperfusion, with levels starting
to decrease thereafter and declining significantly by 24 h compared
with sham-treated mice. These results correspond with
those of previous studies showing that HDAC11 regulates inflammatory
and immune responses.39,52 Histone deacetylase 11 regulates
the expression of the gene encoding interleukin (IL)-10 in
antigen-presenting cells (APC): overexpression of HDAC11
inhibited IL-10 expression and induced inflammation, whereas
disruption of HDAC11 in APC led to the upregulation of IL-10
expression and impaired antigen-specific T cell responses.39
Thus, the early enhanced expression of HDAC11 in the present
study may be correlated with the initiation and aggravation of
stroke-induced inflammation. Histone deacetylase 11 may be a
potential molecular target for anti-inflammation strategies in acute
ischaemic stroke.
In conclusion, our findings concerning the diverse expression
patterns of HDACs in experimental stroke have implications for
targeting individual HDACs for neuroprotective treatment in
acute ischaemic stroke. Studies are underway to further define the
roles of these HDACs, especially HDAC3, HDAC6 and
HDAC11, in cellular and animal models of brain ischaemia, with
the aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets for acute ischaemic
stroke and facilitating successful translation of experimental
stroke research into clinical application.
