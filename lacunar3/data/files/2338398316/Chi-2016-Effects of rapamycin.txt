Abstract—Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) leads to cell growth and survival. We tested the
hypothesis that inhibition of mTOR would increase infarct
size and decrease microregional O
2
supply/consumption
balance after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. This was
tested in isoflurane-anesthetized rats with middle cerebral
artery blockade for 1 h and reperfusion for 2 h with and without
rapamycin (20 mg/kg once daily for two days prior to
ischemia). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined
using a C14-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique.
Regional small-vessel arterial and venous oxygen saturations
were determined microspectrophotometrically. The
control ischemic-reperfused cortex had a similar blood flow
and O
2
consumption to the contralateral cortex. However,
microregional O
2
supply/consumption balance was significantly
reduced in the ischemic-reperfused cortex. Rapamycin
significantly increased cerebral O
2
consumption and
further reduced O
2
supply/consumption balance in the
reperfused area. This was associated with an increased
cortical infarct size (13.5 ± 0.8% control vs. 21.5 ± 0.9%
rapamycin). We also found that ischemia–reperfusion
increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation, while rapamycin
decreased this phosphorylation in both the control and
ischemic-reperfused cortex. This suggests that mTOR is
important for not only cell survival, but also for the control
of oxygen balance after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.

INTRODUCTION
In focal cerebral ischemia, early restoration of regional
cerebral blood flow is the primary means of treatment. It
is usually beneficial and reduces ischemic brain injury
(Alexandrov, 2010; Gomis and Davalos, 2014). However,
restoration of blood flow may not always improve neurologic
outcome because restoration of blood flow to an
ischemic area may lead to some pathophysiologic
changes in that region (Shi and Liu, 2007). In addition,
cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization and O
2
consumption
may or may not be fully restored after reperfusion
(Martin et al., 2009; Tichauer et al., 2009; Weiss et al.,
2013). Microregional O
2
supply/consumption balance is
heterogeneous and reperfusion shifts this balance lower
and increases its heterogeneity (Weiss et al., 2013).
New agents that increase cell survival and improve oxygen
supply/consumption balance could act to further
reduce the degree of stroke damage (Kaur et al., 2013).
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
protein kinase that promotes cell growth and survival
that might prove to be a viable target for treatment of
the damaged or ischemic brain (Hwang and Kim, 2011;
Don et al., 2012). It is part of two protein complexes,
mTORC1 and mTORC2, and more recently has been
shown to play a central role in the control of cellular metabolism
(Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). The best known
rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 target is S6K1, a protein
kinase that phosphorylates the ribosomal subunit S6 to
control translation initiation. Activation of mTORC1
increases protein synthesis and metabolism (Morita
et al., 2015) whereas inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin
downregulates S6K activation, S6 phosphorylation and
protein synthesis. Prolonged rapamycin treatment can
indirectly inhibit mTORC2 and Akt activation by preventing
the association of mTOR with mTORC2 components
rictor and SIN1 (Sarbassov et al., 2006). There is also evidence
that mTOR can activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(Chen et al., 2012b). This could enhance glycolytic flux
and alter vascular growth or the degree of vasodilation.
Some of these changes could protect the injured brain
(Don et al., 2012).
In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that
inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin would
worsen the damage after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
and also adversely affect microregional O
2
supply/consumption balance in the reperfused region.
This was tested in isoflurane-anesthetized rats
subjected to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and
reperfusion with and without rapamycin treatment. We

found that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin increased the
damage after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, increased
cerebral metabolism and reduced microregional oxygen
balance in the injured rat brain. This suggests that
activation of mTOR might reverse these effects in
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
This investigation was conducted in accordance to US
Public Health Service Guidelines using the Guide for the
Care of Laboratory Animals (DHHS Publication No. 85-
23, revised 1996) and was approved by our Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Sixteen male Fischer
344 rats (3 months) were randomly divided into a
cerebral ischemic-reperfused (n= 8) and rapamycintreated
ischemic-reperfused (n= 8) group. In the
rapamycin-treated animals, 20 mg/kg of rapamycin (LC
Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) dissolved in normal
saline and 10% DMSO was injected ip once a day for
two days. Experiments were conducted 48 h after the
first injection. In the control group, vehicle was injected.
Each rat was used to measure regional cerebral blood
flow and microscopic arterial and venous oxygen
saturations (SvO
2
). The rats were initially anesthetized
with 2% isoflurane in an air and oxygen mixture through
a tracheal tube to maintain the arterial pO
2
at about
100 mmHg. A femoral artery and vein were cannulated.
The venous catheter was used to administer radioactive
tracer. The artery catheter was connected to a pressure
transducer and an Iworx data acquisition system to
monitor heart rate and blood pressure. This catheter was
also used to obtain arterial blood samples for analysis of
hemoglobin, blood gases and pH using a Radiometer
blood gas analyzer. The isoflurane concentration was
decreased to 1.4%. Body temperature was monitored
and maintained at 37C with a servo-controlled rectal
thermistor probe and a heating lamp.
We used the transient occlusion of the MCA using an
intraluminal thread as our technique to study cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion (Longa et al., 1989; Lipsanen and
Jolkkonen, 2011; Weiss et al., 2013). The common carotid
artery was exposed through a midline ventral cervical
incision and carefully separated from the adjacent nerve.
Then a 4.0 monofilament thread with its tip rounded was
inserted into the stump of the external carotid artery and
advanced approximately 1.7 cm into the internal carotid
artery until resistance was felt. The filament was held in
place for 60 min blocking the MCA and then it was
removed, allowing reperfusion, and the external carotid
artery was closed. Measurements were performed after
120 min of reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood flow
and microscopic O
2
saturations of small veins and arteries
were determined in several brain regions in both
groups of animals.
Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by the
14C-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiographic
technique. Briefly, 40lCi of 14C-iodoantipyrine was
infused intravenously. When the isotope entered the
venous circulation, the arterial catheter was cut to
20 mm to minimize smearing. Twenty ll blood samples
were obtained from the arterial catheter approximately
every 3 s during next 60 s. At the moment when the last
sample was obtained the animal was decapitated and
the head was frozen in liquid nitrogen. While frozen, the
brain was sampled from three regions: ischemic cortex,
contralateral cortex and pons. The brain samples were
sectioned (20lm) on a microtome-cryostat and the
sections were exposed to X-ray film to obtain an
autoradiogram. The cerebral 14C-iodoantipyrine
concentrations were determined by reference to
precalibrated standards using the NIH imageJ program.
For each brain region examined, a minimum of eight
optical density measurements were made, each on
different sections. Blood samples were placed in a
tissue solubilizer and 24 h later put in a counting liquid.
These samples were counted on a liquid scintillation
counter and were quench corrected. Regional cerebral
blood flows were then calculated.
Alternate sections from regions of the same brain
(ischemic cortex, contralateral cortex and pons) were
used for the determination of arterial and venous O
2
saturation. The cortical regions were from a5 mm plug
from the parietal cortex over the MCA. Details of this
technique have been published previously (Buchweitz-
Milton and Weiss, 1987; Zhu and Weiss, 1991). Briefly,
the brain sections were cut into wafers at 20C.
Twenty-micron-thick sections were obtained at 35C
under a N
2
atmosphere. The sections were transferred
to precooled glass slides and covered with degassed silicone
oil and a coverslip. These slides were placed on a
microspectrophotometer fitted with an N
2
-flushed cold
stage to obtain readings of optical density at 568, 523
and 560 nm. This three-wavelength method corrects for
the light scattering in the frozen blood. Only vessels cut
in transverse section were studied so that the path of light
traversed only the blood. The size of the measuring spot
was 8lm in diameter. Readings were obtained to determine
O
2
saturation in five arteries and 10 veins (20–
60lm in diameter) in each region. The O
2
content of
blood was determined by multiplying the percent O
2
saturation
by the hemoglobin concentration times 1.36, the
maximal binding capacity of hemoglobin for O
2
per gram.
The difference between the average arterial and venous
O
2
contents (regional O
2
extraction) was then obtained.
Using the Fick principle, we calculated the O
2
consumption
for each region as the product of average flow and
O
2
extraction. This method has been validated in the brain
(Buchweitz-Milton and Weiss, 1987).
An additional four rats in each group were used to
determine the size of the infarct. The brain was
removed and was sliced in coronal sections. There were
typically 3–4 slices of approximately 2–3 mm thickness
of brain tissue each. For tetrazolium staining, a 0.05%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma)
solution in PBS was prepared and warmed to 37C.
The brain slices were placed in the solution and were
incubated for 30 min. The tetrazolium chloride solution
was then poured off and the slices were washed three
times in PBS, 1 min per wash. To keep the slices from
drying out, each slice was placed in a small weighing
boat with PBS. The slides were then scanned and the

scanned images were measured for total and infarcted
areas in the cortex using NIH ImageJ. Cortical infarcted
areas were reported as percent of total cortical area.
In three additional control and rapamycin-treated
animals, brain tissue was lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na
3
PO
4
, 1 mM NaF,
and protease inhibitor cocktail). The lysates were
centrifuged at 16000g for 30 min at 4C. Total extracts
were resolved by SDS–PAGE followed by
immunoblotting. Antibodies to S6, p-S6 (Ser240/244) and
Akt, p-Akt (Ser473) were from Cell Signaling (Danvers,
MA, USA). Western blot analysis was then performed.
Analysis of variance using a repeated measure design
was performed for the various measurements to assess
the difference between the different regions and
treatments examined for hemodynamic, blood gases,
cerebral blood flow, O
2
extraction and O
2
consumption
values. Post hoc testing of multiple comparisons was
performed using Tukey’s procedure. The coefficient of
variation (CV) of SvO
2
was used to compare changes in
heterogeneity. The CV was calculated as 100SD/
mean. A v2 test was used to assess differences in the
distribution of SvO
2
and differences in the number of
low O
2
saturated veins between groups. A value of
P< 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All
values are expressed as mean ± SEM.
RESULTS
Hemodynamic and blood gas parameters in the ischemicreperfused
(1 h MCA occlusion + 2 h reperfusion) and
rapamycin-treated ischemia–reperfusion groups of rats
were within the normal ranges for anesthetized rats
(Table 1). There were no statistically significant
differences in arterial blood pressures between groups.
Heart rates were also similar between the two groups of
rats. Arterial blood gases and pH were controlled and
also were not significantly different between the two
experimental groups.
Cerebral blood flow in the ischemic-reperfused cortex
was not significantly different compared to the
contralateral cortex in the control group, Table 2. In the
rapamycin group, flow in the ischemic-reperfused region
was also similar to the value in the contralateral cortex.
The differences in flow between the control and
rapamycin groups were not statistically significant in
either the ischemic-reperfused and contralateral cortical
regions.
The oxygen extraction of the ischemic-reperfused
cortex was significantly elevated (+17%) compared the
contralateral cortex in the control group, Table 2.
Similarly, the oxygen extraction was also significantly
elevated in the rapamycin group in the ischemicreperfused
region (+37%) compared to the
contralateral cortex. The O
2
extraction in the ischemicreperfused
cortical region of the rapamycin group was
significantly higher in comparison to the same region in
the control group.
Arterial O
2
saturations were similar in all regions and
groups (data not shown). However venous O
2
saturation
was significantly lower in the ischemic-reperfused region
compared to the contralateral cortex in both groups. The
distribution of small-vein (20–60lm diameter) O
2
saturations was heterogeneous in all cortical regions,
Fig. 1. There was a shift to lower values in
the ischemic-reperfused cortex compared to the
contralateral cortex of both experimental groups. The
number of vessels with O
2
saturations below 55% was
significantly greater in the ischemic-reperfused cortex
compared to the contralateral cortex of both groups.
However, the number of low saturation veins was
significantly greater in the rapamycin group (74 of 80)
compared to the control group of rats (34 of 80). The
coefficient of variation (CV = 100 * SD/mean, a
measure of heterogeneity) increased (12.5 vs. 5.5) in
the ischemic-reperfused cortex compared to
contralateral cortex in the control group. However, the
CV did not increase in the ischemic-reperfused region of
the rapamycin group (5.1 vs. 4.9). The ischemicreperfused
cortex of the rapamycin had less very low
saturation veins and a narrower but lower distribution of
O
2
saturations compared to the control group.
Cerebral O
2
consumption in the ischemic-reperfused
cortex was similar to the contralateral cortex in both the
control and rapamycin-treated groups, Fig. 2. However,
cerebral oxygen consumption was significantly higher in

the rapamycin-treated group compared to that observed
in the control group. This was found in both the
rapamycin-treated ischemic-reperfused cortex (+23%)
as well as the contralateral cortex (+28%).
The ratio of O
2
supply to O
2
consumption was lower in
the ischemic-reperfused cortex compared to the
contralateral cortex in both the control and rapamycintreated
groups, Table 2. This ratio was significantly
lower in the ischemic-reperfused cortex of the
rapamycin group compared to the same region in the
control group. The size of cortical infarct measured as
the percentage of total cortical area determined at the
end of the two hour reperfusion period was significantly
greater in the rapamycin-treated group compared to the
control group (control 13.5 ± 0.8% vs. rapamycin 21.5
± 0.9%).
We also examined the effects of ischemia–reperfusion
with and without rapamycin on the phosphorylation of the
mTOR targets, Akt and S6K1,Fig. 3. Neither total Akt nor
S6K1 levels were affected by ischemia–reperfusion or
rapamycin treatment. The level of phosphorylation in the
cortex of both Akt and S6 increased with ischemia–
reperfusion. Prolonged rapamycin treatment decreased
these levels of phosphorylation of Akt and S6 in both
the ischemic-reperfused and contralateral cortex below
control levels.
We also compared the effects of rapamycin on brain
O
2
supply/consumption balance in a remote cerebral
region, the pons. Blood flow (control: 119 ± 10 vs.
rapamycin 152 ± 13 ml/min/100 g) in the pons was
significantly higher in the rapamycin group. The oxygen
extraction (control: 4.6 ± 0.2 vs. rapamycin 4.9
± 0.3 ml O
2
/100 ml) was similar between the two

groups in the pons. However, the oxygen consumption of
the pons was significantly higher in the rapamycin
group (control 5.4 ± 0.5 vs. rapamycin 7.5 ± 0.8 ml
O
2
/min/100 g). The ratio of O
2
supply to O
2
consumption
was not significantly altered in the rapamycin-treated
group (control 2.96 ± 0.05 vs. rapamycin 3.07 ± 0.03).
DISCUSSION
Despite reperfusion of the MCA, there was a significant
area of cell death even though local oxygen
consumption and blood flow were largely restored. The
ratio of O
2
supply to consumption was significantly
reduced and the number of low-saturation small veins
was increased in this area. This was similar to our
previous report (Weiss et al., 2013). The major new finding
of this study was that rapamycin increased both infarct
size and cerebral oxygen consumption. In addition, the
number of low O
2
saturation small veins was significantly
increased despite a reduction in the variance (reduced
numbers of both very low and high saturation veins). This
might imply that activation of mTOR may play a protective
role after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.
With blockage of a cerebral artery, blood flow and O
2
consumption decline (Buchweitz-Milton and Weiss, 1987;
Dirnagl, 2012). Glucose utilization was also depressed in
cerebral ischemia (Martin et al., 2009). Cerebral oxygen
extraction was also increased and venous O
2
saturations
declined in the affected region. This has been observed in
both cats and rats (Buchweitz-Milton and Weiss, 1987;
Chi et al., 2010). Tissue PO
2
also significantly declined
(Shi and Liu, 2007). Deoxyhemoglobin levels may be
increased in humans with stroke (Sakatani et al., 2007).
Without further treatment, large parts of this area will suffer
both loss of function and irreversible damage
(Lipsanen and Jolkkonen, 2011; Dirnagl, 2012). With
reperfusion, blood flow was partially restored and O
2
consumption
returned to the value found in the contralateral
cortex (Weiss et al., 2013). However, the local O
2
supply/-
consumption ratio remained significantly depressed.

rapamycin treatment. The fold increase or decrease in phosphorylation normalized to the control-non-ischemic region is shown. The quantitation of
these changes is also shown (bottom).

Small cerebral vein O
2
saturations were lowered and their
heterogeneity increased compared to the contralateral
cortex, see Fig. 1. This indicated many small regions of
low oxygenation within the reperfused cortical region in
the control group. In addition, we found significant cell
damage within the ischemic-reperfused cortex.
The administration of rapamycin prior to ischemia–
reperfusion significantly increased the size of the
damaged cortical area compared to the control group
(+59%) in our study. It has been suggested that
activation of mTOR should be neuroprotective after
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (Pastor et al., 2009;
Chen et al., 2012a; Chong et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2014). However, other investigators have suggested that
treatment with rapamycin, and therefore inhibition of
mTOR, is neuroprotective (Guo et al., 2014; Qi et al.,
2014; Xie et al., 2014). These differences may depend
on the time or route of administration or the relative importance
of the various multifaceted effects (discussed
below) of mTOR activation.
We found that cerebral oxygen consumption was
increased in all examined regions after rapamycin
treatment, which leads to inhibition of mTOR, Fig. 2.
This is somewhat surprising in that activation of mTOR
usually leads to increased protein synthesis, cell growth
and metabolism (Morita et al., 2015). In certain cases, a
negative feedback loop for rapamycin treatment acting
through PI3K activation could occur, which could lead to
an increased level of cerebral metabolism and protein
synthesis (Harrington et al., 2005). Rapamycin has also
been reported to protect mitochondrial function (Li et al.,
2014), which could be associated with increased cerebral
metabolism.
The mTOR is part of two protein complexes, mTORC1
and mTORC2, and is involved in the control of cell growth
and metabolism (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). Among
the two complexes, mTORC1 is better understood largely
due to the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on this complex.
The most well-characterized rapamycin-sensitive
mTORC1 target is S6K1, a protein kinase that phosphorylates
the ribosomal subunit S6 to control translation initiation.
We saw a decreased activation of S6K1 with
rapamycin, Fig. 3. There is good evidence that activation
of mTOR increases protein synthesis and metabolism
(Morita et al., 2015). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin
downregulates S6K activation and S6 phosphorylation.
These effects should reduce metabolism and protein synthesis.
This may explain the reported beneficial effects of
short-term rapamycin (Guo et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2014;
Xie et al., 2014). Our chronic rapamycin treatment regime
appeared to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2.
The mTORC2 complex, which is not acutely
rapamycin-sensitive, responds to growth factors and
promotes the activation of Akt via phosphorylation (Oh
and Jacinto, 2011). Prolonged rapamycin treatment can
indirectly inhibit mTORC2 and Akt activation by preventing
association of mTOR with mTORC2 components rictor
and SIN1 (Sarbassov et al., 2006). We observed a
decreased Akt signaling after rapamycin. Active Akt
impinges on mTORC1 signaling via negative regulation
of TSC1/2 and consequently relieves suppression of
mTORC1 by TSC1/2 (Huang and Manning, 2008). This
could also affect brain metabolism. Further work is necessary
to determine which of these pathways are responsible
for the rapamycin-induced increases in cerebral
metabolism. Activation of some of these mTOR pathways
has been reported to be neuroprotective after cerebral
ischemia (Papadakis et al., 2013). We observed an
increased level of signaling of both Akt and S6K1 after
ischemia–reperfusion. The effects of mTOR signaling during
ischemia are controversial, but activation has been
suggested to be protective (Hwang and Kim, 2011;
Chen et al., 2012a; Chong et al., 2013).
Our biochemical analysis revealed that both mTORC1
and mTORC2 were inhibited under our conditions. Recent
studies indicate that activation of Akt via phosphorylation
at the mTORC2-targeted site is required for cell
adaptation and survival during metabolic stress (Shin
et al., 2015). Thus, defining the optimal dosage, time
and/or route of administration would be crucial to prevent
mTORC2/Akt inactivation and thus obtain beneficial
effects of mTOR inhibition during ischemia.
We found that the ischemic-reperfused brain had
significantly reduced small-vein O
2
saturations and
increased O
2
extraction. Tissue PO
2
was reported to be
significantly reduced by cerebral ischemia, but only
partially restored by reperfusion (Shi and Liu, 2007). Both
venous O
2
saturation and tissue PO
2
are very heterogeneously
distributed in the ischemic-reperfused brain (Shi
and Liu, 2007; Weiss et al., 2013). Treatment with rapamycin
led to increased oxygen consumption in the
ischemic-reperfused region, with no significant change
in cerebral blood flow. Blood flow maintenance may be
regulated by rapamycin’s effect in increasing nitric oxide
production (Lin et al., 2013). This increase in metabolism
after rapamycin treatment was associated with reduced
average small-vein O

saturation and elevated regional
O
2
extraction in the ischemic-reperfused region below
that of the contralateral cortex as well as control group
values.
Rapamycin significantly reduced average venous O
2
saturation in the ischemic-reperfused cortex. However
the heterogeneity of this distribution was also reduced
as noted by the reduced CV of venous O
2
saturations.
This was associated with lack of very low or high smallvein
O
2
saturations, Fig. 1. The reduced low values may
be linked to the increased cell death we and others
have reported with chronic rapamycin (Chong et al.,
2013). While the reduced high values of venous O
2
saturations
may be associated with areas of increased nitric
oxide production (Lin et al., 2013). Other agents, such
as anesthetics, can also affect the heterogeneity of
small-vein O
2
saturation in the ischemic-reperfused cortex
(Chi et al., 2015).
In summary, there was significant cell death even
though local oxygen consumption and blood flow were
largely restored in the ischemic-reperfused region. The
ratio of O
2
supply to consumption was significantly
reduced and the number of low saturation veins was
increased in this area (Weiss et al., 2013). The major finding
of this study was that rapamycin increased both infarct
size and cerebral oxygen consumption. In addition, the
