SUMMARY
Cerebrovascular complications are rare following viper
bites. A 65-year-old man presented with loss of
consciousness and developed haemiparesis following a
viper bite. Coagulation parameters were severely
deranged. MRI showed acute ischaemic infarction on the
left side in the precentral and postcentral gyrus,
hemipons and cerebellum. Troponin T was elevated and
transient left bundle branch block was seen. The patient
had a good outcome following treatment with Anti
Snake Venom and supportive therapy. Possible
mechanisms of infarction are discussed.
BACKGROUND
Snake bites are a vastly underreported phenomenon
in South East Asia. An estimated 35 000–50 000
people die every year in India due to complications
of snake bites.1 Snake venom is predominantly of
two types—haemotoxic and neurotoxic. The
Viperidae family of snakes has haemotoxic venom.
The most common complications of viper bite
envenomation are haemmorhagic complications.
Cerebrovascular complications have been reported,
although they are uncommon. Acute ischaemic
stroke, especially that involving the posterior circulation
is exceedingly rare following a viper bite.2–5
Myocarditis has not been reported as a consequence
of viper envenomation in humans. We
report myocarditis along with cerebellar, pontine
and lacunar infarcts following a viper bite.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 65-year-old man was found unconscious in a
farm, bleeding from the mouth and left ankle. On
arrival at the emergency triage, his consciousness
had only improved minimally. The history given by
family members was only significant for occasional
alcohol intake. He was a non-smoker. His vitals
were stable. Fang marks were noted over the left
medial malleolus with bleeding from the wound
site. Neurological examination revealed a Glasgow
Coma Scale score of 10/15 (E-4, V-2, M-4). Pupils
were bilaterally equal and reactive. Power was >3/5
in all four limbs, the plantar reflex was flexor bilaterally.
Examination of other systems did not reveal
any abnormalities. Consciousness improved after
admission but the patient was noted to have slurring
of speech and right hemiparesis (power 1+/5
in right upper and lower limbs); he also developed
cellulitis of the left lower limb in a very short duration
of time.
INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory reports were significant for elevated
white cell count (17 900/mm3) and a deranged
coagulation profile (prothrombin time >120 s).
Troponin T was elevated (0.325 ng/mL), as was the
serum urea (88 mg/dL). An ECG was performed
which showed features of a left bundle branch
block (figure 1). An echocardiogram was performed
and it showed septal beaking suggestive of
a left bundle branch block. There were no regional
wall motion abnormalities and no mitral regurgitation.
A CTof the brain did not show any abnormalities.
An MRI of the brain revealed acute ischaemic
infarction on the left side in the precentral and
postcentral gyrus, hemipons and cerebellum
(figures 2–7).
TREATMENT
He was started on equine polyvalent Anti Snake
Venom (Bharat Serum and Vaccines Ltd.

and clindamycin alongside supportive therapy. A total
of four units of fresh frozen plasma were infused. A magnesium
sulfate dressing was applied to the left lower limb. The coagulation
profile began to normalise soon after starting the Anti
Snake Venom—the international normalised ratio had come
down to 1.15 by day 3 of admission. The left bundle branch
block also resolved (figure 8). The patient began physiotherapy
for the affected side. Limb power on the affected side improved
from 1+/5 after admission to 4+/5 at the time of discharge
12 days later.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient had improved clinically and symptomatically at the
time of discharge. There was some residual lower limb swelling
on follow-up 1 month later. He was asymptomatic on review
2 months later.
DISCUSSION
Acute ischaemic stroke following viper bite is rare but well
documented. Del Brutto and Del Brutto6 in their review of
neurological complications of snake bites found 23 documented
cases of cerebral infarction following a viper bite. An overwhelming
majority of the cases reported cortical infarcts, with
only one case of brainstem infarction. Gouda et al3 and Gupta
et al4 reported two different cases of cerebellar infarction following
viper bite. However, this patient developed infarcts in
two different arterial territories, raising questions about the possible
aetiopathogenesis. Among the various theories postulated
to explain ischaemic cerebral infarction following viper bite are

hypotension,7 hypercoagulopathy7–9 and vasculitis due to endothelial
damage.7 10 In this case, hypotension was an unlikely
cause since the location of the infarct was not in a watershed
area. Vasculitis due to the effect of the haemorrhagin toxin on
the endothelium could explain the stroke but the short duration
in which the infarction developed and the unilateral incidence
does not fully support this theory,7 although pre-existing vulnerabilities
may have existed in the affected regions making them
more susceptible to infarction. Hypercoagulopathy due to procoagulant
factors and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation
is supported by the deranged coagulation profile.
While acute myocardial infarction following viper bite has
been well documented, myocarditis following viper envenomation
has only been reported in animals—in dogs11 12 and in
two horses that were injected with venom for antivenom production.13 Myocarditis is hypothesised to occur either due to
direct effects of the toxin on the myocardium9 10 or hypersensitivity
to the venom.14 The patient’s elevated troponin levels
support the diagnosis of myocarditis14 especially since the ECG
and the echocardiogram showed no features to suggest a myocardial
infarction. The resolution of the bundle branch block
following treatment with Anti Snake Venom indicates that the
toxin could indeed have been responsible for the cardiac pathology
in this patient.
Previously reported cases of posterior circulation infarction
following snake bite have usually resulted in fatalities. In one
case the patient survived but had no improvement in neurological
status and was given poor prognosis.5 In the other
case the patient recovered significantly.3 The quick identification
of envenomation, attributing the haemiparesis to the
effects of snake venom and the immediate institution of Anti
Snake Venom therapy along with supportive therapy led to a
wholly positive outcome for this patient. This case underlines
the importance of identifying uncommon complications of
poisonous snake bites and the timely use of Anti Snake
Venom.

Learning points
▸ Acute ischaemic stroke is a very rare complication of viper
envenomation, which usually causes haemorrhagic
manifestations.
▸ The exact mechanism of cerebral ischaemia and myocarditis
is not yet known but direct toxic effects of the venom on
the endothelium and myocardium could be responsible.
▸ This case shows the importance of initiating Anti Snake
Venom therapy as soon as signs of envenomation are noted.
