1. Introduction
Immersion staining of fresh brain slices with 2,3,5-
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) is a simple and popular
method for detecting infarction in experimental stroke models
(Bederson et al., 1986). TTC, a colorless water-soluble dye, is
reduced to a deep red, water-insoluble compound (formazan)
predominantly in the mitochondria of living cells, hence distinguishing between viable and infarcted brain tissue after stroke.
However, immersion TTC-staining has its limitations because it is
often difficult to section unfixed, edematous brains after severe
ischemic injury, especially in newborn rodents. While perfusion
staining of rodent brains by intracardiac injection of TTC solution
was reported, we have found this method to be very inefficient
(see Section 3), and the previous TTC perfusion-labeling method
was rarely adopted in the literature (Isayama et al., 1991). The
lack of a reliable in vivo TTC-labeling method has increased the
workloadofquantifyingtissuedamageinexperimentalstroke,and
uncertainty in distinguishing the core-versus-peri infarct areas for
biochemical analysis.
Interestingly, although intracardiac injection of TTC hardly
labels the brain, it stains the heart efficiently and has been used

widely to detect experimental myocardial infarction. This disparity suggests to us that the entry of TTC dye to central nervous
system may be hindered by the blood–brain-barrier (BBB). To test
thishypothesis,weperformedTTCperfusion-labelingafterosmotic
BBB disruption with mannitol (Rapoport and Thompson, 1973;
Rapoport, 2000), and found a greatly enhanced brain-staining
capacity.HerewereportoptimizationoftheTTCperfusion-labeling

mouse brains. Further, we show that the in vivo TTC-labeling
method is compatible with biochemical analysis and distinguish
betweenviableandinfarctedtissue.Finally,usingthismethod,we

et al., 2005). Additional applications of this new vitality-detection
method are also discussed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal surgery
For adult cerebral hypoxia–ischemia (HI), eight-to-twelve
week-old male CD1 (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) and Thy1-
YFP mice (Jackson Laboratories Stock no. 003782, Bar Harbor, ME)
were challenged by transient cerebral HI, performed as described

previouslywithminormodifications(Adhamietal.,2006;Shereen
et al., 2011). Briefly, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
(IP) injection of avertin, and the right common carotid artery was
ligated by two releasable (Mule) knots of 4-O silt suture. After
carotid ligation, mice were infused with 7.5% O2 balanced by
92.5% N2 through a face-mask for 60min. The body tempeture
of mice was maintained between 37.5 and 38.5 ◦C by Digi-Sense
Benchtop RTD connected with a heating lamp and rectal probe
(EW-89000-10; Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). The knots on
the common carotid artery were released at the end of hypoxic
stress.
For lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-sensititized neonatal cerebral HI,
LPS (0.3mg/kg, Sigma) was IP-injected to 5-day-old CD1 mice
at 72h before cerebral HI, as previously described with minor
modifications (Eklind et al., 2005). At postnatal day 8, mice were
anesthetized by 2% isoflurane and subjected to permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery. Mouse pups recovered for
1.5h and were then exposed to hypoxia in glass chambers containing 10% O2 and 90% N2 in a waterbacth kept at 37 ◦C. After
hypoxic exposure, mice were returned to dams in the animal care
facility. The in vivo TTC-labeling procedure was performed at 48h
recovery. These animal procedures were approved by the InstitutionalAnimalCareandUseCommittee(IACUC)andconformtothe
National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
2.2. In vivo TTC-labeling method
To disrupt BBB, mannitol (0.5–1.4M, Sigma) prepared in PBS at
a temperature of 37 ◦C was IP-injected to animals (∼0.1ml/g body
weight) for 5–180min as indicated in the text. Mice were anesthetized with avertin and transcardially perfused of PBS followed
by10mlof2%2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride(TTC)(Sigma).At
10minaftertranscardialTTCperfusion,thebrainsofanimalswere
removed and placed into 4% paraformaldehyde. Alternatively, the
extractedbrainscanbeincubatedinwarmphosphate-salinebuffer
(PBS)for30mintoenhanceTTC-staining.Forbiochemicalanalysis,
brainswereremovedafterTTC-perfusionanddividedintothecontralateral (the left cortex) and lesion sides (the right cortex) for
protein extraction.
2.3. Quantification of brain infarction
The post-fixed brains after in vivo TTC-labeling were sectioned into 0.8mm thick coronal slices with Vibratome (Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL) and photographed for quantification as previously
described (Yang et al., 2009). Briefly, digital images of 5 slices in
each brain were analyzed using the NIH ImageJ 1.4 software. Brain
damage was expressed as the ratio of the infarcted area (white
area in the right side) to the area of the undamged, contralateral
hemisphere.
2.4. Histology and immunohistochemistry
Thefixedbrainsafter in vivoTTC-labelingweretransferredinto
graded30%sucrosesolutionandfrozeninO.C.T.compoundsforsectioning at 50m-thickness using a sliding microtome (SM2000R,
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). YFP was visualized with an Olympus
epifluorescent microscope (BX-51). For immunohitochemistry,
the following antibodies were used: mouse anti-HSP70 (SPA810;
Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), rabbit anti-DARPP32 (A31656;
Chemicon,Temecula,CA),andmouseanti-microtubule-associated
protein 2 (MAP2; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The immunoreactivity was detected sequentially by biotinylated secondary
antibodies, the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Lab, Burlingame,
CA), and the diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
reaction.
2.5. Cell fractionation and immunoblot analyses
The cortex from fresh brain tissue after in vivo TTC-labeling
was subjected to protein extraction or mitochondrial–cytosol
fractionation, as described previously (Adhami et al., 2006).
For total protein extraction, three part of cortex (contralateral side with red staining and the ipslateral side with or
without red staining) were seperated and homogenized in TLB
buffer [20mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 137mmol/L NaCl, 25mmol/L -
glycerophosphate, 25mmol/L Na-pyrophosphate, 2mmol/L EDTA,
1mmol/LNa3VO4,1%TritonX-100,10%glycerol,1mmol/Lphenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)]. For
mitochondrial–cytosol fractionation, the tissue was homogenized
in cold buffer (20mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 250mmol/L sucrose,
10mmol/LKCl,1.5mmol/LMgCl2,1mmol/LEDTA,1mmol/LEGTA,
0.7% protease inhibitor cocktail, 1mmol/L Na3VO4). The extracted
protein samples were processed for immunoblotting and visualized by HRP-reactive chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham
Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). Primary antibodies were rabbit
anti-cytochrome c (#4272; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), goat anti-
AIF(#sc9416;SantaCruz,SantaCruz,CA),mouseanti-cytochrome
oxidase subunit IV (#A21348; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad
, CA), mouse anti-HSP70, rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (#sc634; Santa
Cruz), rabbit anti-caspase-3 (#9662; Cell Signaling) and mouse
anti--actin (#A544; Sigma).
2.6. Reverse-transcription PCR
The RNA from fresh brain tissues after in vivo TTC labeling was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for RT-PCR analysis,
as described previously (Sun et al., 2010). Brifely, total RNA was
processed with the high-capcacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA) to transcript cDNAs. The
semi-quantitativePCRofmice Hsp70, Caspase-3, Bim-EL, Bcl-xLand
Tspo cDNAs were detected using the following primers, and the
cDNA of a housekeeping gene -actin was measured in parallel
as an internal control: Hsp70, 5-AAGCAGACGCAGACCTTCAC-
3 and 5-AGATGACCTCCTGGCACTTG-3; Caspase-3, 5-CTATCTGGACAGTAGTTACAAAAT-3 and 5-CAGTCAGAGCTCCGGCAGTAG-3;Bim-EL,5-CTACCAGATCCCCACTTTTC-3 and5-ACCCTCCTTGTGTAAGTTTC-3; Bcl-xL, 5-AGGCAGGCGATGAGTTTGAA-3 and
5-TGAAGCGCTCCTGGCCTTTC-3; Tspo, 5-ATGGGGTATGGCTCCTACATAGT-3 and 5-CCACTGACAAGCAGAAGATCG-3; and -
actin, 5-GAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGAT-3 and 5-GAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGAT-3. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Bands were visualized using
an electrophoresis image analysis system (Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, NY).
2.7. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) zymography
MMP-9 and MMP-2 zymogram was performed, as previously
described (Yang et al., 2009). Briefly, MMP-9 and MMP-2 in brain
extracts was pulled-down using the gelatin SepharoseTM 4B beads
(GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and separated by electrophoresis in a poly-acrylamide gel containing 0.15% gelatin.
After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice with 2.5% Triton
X-100 and incubated in reaction buffer (50mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5,
200mmol/L NaCl, 5mmol/L CaCl2) at 37 ◦C overnight. The gel
was stained with Coomassie blue and destained to reveal the
protease activity. Shown are the inverted image of zymogram
gels.

3. Results
3.1. Optimization of TTC perfusion-labeling by mannitol-induced
BBB disruption
First, we compared the ability of intracardiac versus intracarotid artery perfusion of 2% TTC solution to stain the brain
(Isayama et al., 1991; Dettmers et al., 1994). Whereas intra-artery
(IA)injectionofTTCworkedbetterthanintracardiacperfusion,neither method provided strong staining of the brain, despite intense
labelingoftheliver(Fig.1A)andheart(datanotshown).Incontrast,
followingintraperitoneal(IP)injectionof1.4Mmannitol(250mg/g
body weight) that allowed the tail vein-injected Evans blue dye to
labelbrains(Fig.1B),theIA-injectedTTCdyealsostainedthebrain
intensely (Fig. 1A). These results showed that osmotic opening of
BBB by mannitol greatly increases the efficiency of brain-staining
by TTC perfusion-labeling (Rapoport, 2000; Brown et al., 2004;
McCarty et al., 2009; Louboutin et al., 2010).
Tooptimizethenew in vivoTTC-labelingmethod,weexamined
the effects of dosage and timing of mannitol-pretreatment on the
stainingintensitybyintracardiacperfusionofTTC.Thisexperiment
showedadose-dependentenhancementofTTC-stainbymannitolpretreatment (Fig. 1C). Based on these data, we chose 250mg/g
mannitol (equivalent to 0.1ml/g body weight of 1.4M mannitol)
for adult mice, and 312mg/g mannitol (0.125ml/g of 1.4M mannitol
) for newborn mice in subsequent experiments. We found at,
at this concentration, a window of 30–120min mannitol pretreatment provided the most intense and homogeneous brain labeling
by TTC. In less than 30min mannitol-pretreatment, the mouse
cerebral cortex was faintly stained. Longer than 120min, mice
becameenfeebledandbrainstainingwasweakoruneven(Fig.1D).
Hence, we selected an interval of 30min between mannitolpretreatment and TTC-perfusion in the rest of experiments in this
report.

(Adhami et al., 2006). (A and B) The in vivo labeling method detected a region devoid of TTC staining on the caroid artery-ligated hemispehre that was readily discerinible

as, decrease of DARPP32 and MAP2 labeling on the HI-challenged hemisphere (indciated by asterisks), suggetsing that perfusion TTC-staining does not constrict subsequent
immunocytochemistryanalysis.(F–H)50mbrainslicesofHIinjuredThy1-YFPmiceshowedanareaofreducedTTC-staining(astrisk).DirectvisualizationofYFPexpression
in regions with TTC-staining (G) contained numerous neurons in the cerebral cortex (Ctx) and neurites in the corpus callosum (CC) or the striatum (St). In contrast, very few
YFP+ neurons or neurites were present in regions with TTC-staining (H). Shown are typical results in n>5 for each experiment in A–H.
3.2. In vivo TTC-labeling following experimental stroke in adult
mice
Next we tested whether the new in vivo TTC-labeling method
can detect infarction after experimental stroke. To do so, 8–12
week-old male CD1 or Thy1-YFP mice were subjected to thrombotic stroke induced by unilateral cerebral hypoxia–ischemia
(HI) (Adhami et al., 2006). Brains were collected 24h later by
mannitol-facilitated TTC-labeling followed by transcardiac perfusionoffixatives.Thebrainswereremovedfromtheskullonlyafter
cardiac perfusion of fixatives. This procedure revealed a large area
devoidof TTC-stainingon thecarotidartery-occludedsideof brain
(asterisk in Fig. 2A). Since the in vivo TTC-stained brain was postfixed
, they were easily sectioned into 0.8mm-thick slices while
retaining a clear contrast of red (viable) and white (presumably
infracted) color contract (Fig. 2B).
To ensure that the lack of TTC-staining signifies cell injury, we
sectioned the brain into 50m-slices for immunocytochemistry.
The HI-injured hemisphere showed an increase of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) staining, accompanied by reduction of dopamineand cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP32, a striatal neuron marker) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2,
a dendritic marker) staining (Fig. 2C–E). These results show that
in vivo TTC-labeling can be combined with immunocytochemistry
analysis. Yet, because repeated washing in immunocytochemistry
diminished the contrast of TTC-stain, it is difficult to determine
whether the boundary of TTC-stain corresponds to the border of
ischemic cell injury.
To overcome this obstacle, we subjected Thy1-YFP mice – in
which, a subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons express the
yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) – to cerebral HI and in vivo TTC-
labeling,followedbydirectvisualizationofneuronsin50mslices.
This analysis showed that neurons in the region devoid of TTC-
staining(asteriskinFig.2F;therectanglesweremagnifiedinFig.2G
and H) either disappeared or showed severe destruction. This patternsuggeststhattheboundaryofinvivoTTC-labelingcorresponds
to morphological cell injury after experimental stroke.
3.3. In vivo TTC-labeling is compatible with biochemical analysis
of experimental stroke
WhilethetoxicologypropertiesofTTChavenotbeenthoroughly
investigated according to the manufacturer’s material safety data
sheet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), we noticed that systemic administration of 2% TTC invariably kills mice rapidly, even without any
experimental stroke challenge. This observation raised concerns
whether the in vivo TTC-labeling method will alter the cell death
signaling responses to stroke.

Toexaminethisissue,wefirstperformedTTCperfusion-labeling
in unchallenged (UN) or HI-injured mice at 16h recovery, and
collected the brains for mRNA and the mitochondrial protein
distribution analysis (Fig. 3A–D; n=3–5 for each). RT-PCR analysis showed increase of the transcripts encoding Hsp70, Caspase-3
(pro-apoptotic) Bim-EL, and 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a
neuroinflammationmarker(Martinetal.,2010)inTTC-negativetissue
, where reduction of the (anti-apoptotic) Bcl-xL transcripts was
evident(Fig.3AandB).Cell-fractionationfollowedbyimmunoblot
analysis showed that in vivo TTC-labeling per se caused little or
no leakage of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)
from the mitochondria. In contrast, HI-injured and TTC-negative
tissues showed conspicuous redistribution of cytochrome c and
AIF from the mitochondria to cytosol (Fig. 3C and D). Of note,
AIF was shortened from 62kDa in the mitochondria to 57kDa in
the cytosol in TTC-negative regions, similar to a previous report
usingfreshbrainsampleafterfocalischemiaforanalysis(Caoetal.,
2007).
To further examine the suitability of in vivo TTC-labeling for
biochemicalanalysis,wecomparedtheproteinlevelsofHSP70,BclxL
, and pro-Caspase-3 in the unchallenged (UN), the contralateral
hemisphere (L), and peri-infarct (R/TTC+) or core regions (R/TTC−)
at 16h post-HI (Fig. 3E and F; n=3). We found that the peri-infarct
tissue contained a higher level of HSP70 than the core, in accord
with previous reports (Kinouchi et al., 1993). The reduction of
Bcl-xL and pro-Caspase-3 protein levels was also evident in the
HI-injured hemisphere.
Finally, we tested whether the in vivo TTC-labeling procedure
interferedwithgelatinzymographythatdetectscerebralischemiainduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and -2 (MMP-2)
activities (Rosenberg et al., 1998; Park et al., 2009). This experiment showed that HI induced significant MMP-9 and MMP-2
activity only on the carotid artery-ligated hemisphere, in samples
extractedfromfresh(noTTC)orTTC-stainedbrains(Fig.3GandH;
n=4). Together, these results suggest that the in vivo TTC-labeling
procedure is compatible with biochemical analysis of cerebral
ischemia.
3.4. In vivo TTC-labeling of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury in mice
Next,wetestedwhetherthe in vivoTTC-labelingprocedurecan
be used to quantify HI-induced injury in P10 mouse pups, whose
small brain sizes have excluded the use of immersion TTC-labeling
in the past. Further, we used in vivo TTC-labeling to examine
thereportedinjury-sensitizationeffectbylipopolysaccharide(LPS)
pre-exposure at 72h before HI in rodent pups (Eklind et al.,
2005).
WefoundthattheinvivoTTC-labelingmethod(0.125ml/gbody
weight of 1.4M mannitol was used in mouse pups) readily stains

LPS pre-exposure at P5 and HI-insult at P8 (unilateral carotid ligation and 20min 10% oxygen) (Fig. 4A and B). Simple inspection
of TTC-stained brains suggested greater damage in the LPS72h/HI
group. When the TTC-stained brains were post-fixed and sliced
for quantification, we found a threefold increase of infarction by
LPS pretreatment (Fig. 4C; 8.4% in the HI group [n=10] compared
to 26.8% in the LPS72h/HI group [n=14]; asterisk: p<0.05 by ttest
). These results indicated that the new in vivo TTC-labeling
method can be used to quantify infarction in neonatal stroke.
Further, our results support the reported injury-amplification
effect by 72h LPS pre-exposure in newborn rodents, in contrast
to its protective preconditioning effect in cerebral ischemia in
adults (Tasaki et al., 1997; Rosenzweig et al., 2004; Eklind et al.,
2005).

4. Discussion
4.1. Osmotic opening of BBB facilitates TTC perfusion-labeling
The ability to quickly determine the location and extent of
infarction after experimental cerebral ischemia is important for
the investigation of underlying mechanisms and assessment of
new interventions. While immersion TTC-staining is a very useful method to quantify cerebral infarction, it is less applicable to
severely injured, edematous brains or smaller newborn brains in
rodents. The alternative methods, including comparison of neural injury scores or quantification of the area devoid of Nissl or
MAP2 staining, are all either semi-quantitative or labor-intensive.
Hence,inspiredbyrecentreportsofmannitol-facilitatedCNS-entry
of viral vectors (McCarty et al., 2009; Louboutin et al., 2010), we
adaptedthisapproachtodevelopaTTCperfusion-labelingmethod.
The new in vivo TTC-labeling method is simple, fast, and reliable.
Furthermore, it is applicable in both adult and neonatal brains
after experimental stroke, delineates the boundary of ischemic
cell injury, and supports biochemical analysis of experimental
stroke.
Previous studies have established that the mechanism of
mannitol-induced BBB opening is through vasodilatation and the
shrinkage of cerebrovascular endothelial cells that collectively
widen inter-endothelial tight junctions (Rapoport, 2000; Brown
etal.,2004).Ourobservationofmannitol-pretreatmentfacilitating
theCNS-entryofEvanbluedyesuggeststhatTTC,asmall-molecule
chemical, is also bound by larger proteins in the blood and thus
unable to cross BBB. Of note, the TTC perfusion-labeling method
requires a threefold higher dose of mannitol in IP administration
than those used for introducing virus to the CNS. Accordingly,
whilethewindowofmannitol-facilitatedviralentrytothebrainis
less than 20min (McCarty et al., 2009), the TTC perfusion-labeling
methodprovidesalongerdurationof(30toapproximately120min
following mannitol pretreatment) of brain staining. The increased
temporal window in mannitol-facilitated TTC-labeling is useful
when this method is applied to a group of animals at the same
time.
4.2. The limitation of in vivo TTC-labeling method
The new in vivo TTC perfusion-labeling method, however, shall
be considered a terminal procedure for two reasons. First, because
thismethodusesathreefoldgreaterdoseofmannitolpretreatment
thanthatrequiredforvirusentryintheCNS,theosmoticopeningof
BBB may become irreversible. For example, we noticed substantial
brain staining by TTC-labeling even at 3h after mannitol administration(Fig.1).Further,duetothedistressassociatedwithinjection
with high-osmolarity solutions, the tolerable dose of mannitol for
severelyinjuredanimalsmayrequireadjustmentdependingonthe
experimental conditions.
Secondly, while the previous reports of in vivo TTC labeling did
notdescribeanytoxicityofthiscompound,andthemanufacturer’s
material safety data sheet (MDSD) only stated that the toxicology of TTC has not been thoroughly investigated, we have found it
to be highly toxic to animals in systematical administration. Even
in unchallenged healthy mice, intra-artery or intra-cardial injection of 2% TTC invariably led to the death of animals immediately.
TTC is a cell-permeable colorless chemical that is reduced to a
water-insoluble deep-red formazon compound predominantly in
themitochondriaoflivingcells,thusdistinguishingbetweenviable
(red) and non-viable (white) tissue. However, TTC is also a powerful inhibitor of aerobic oxidation in the mitochondria (Sato and
Sato, 1965). Hence, TTC perfusion-labeling is a terminal procedure
and animals shall reach deep anesthesia prior to intracardiac or
intravenous infusion of TTC solution.
4.3. In vivo TTC-labeling supports biochemical analysis of the
ischemic penumbra area
So what are the unique applications by the in vivo TTC-labeling
method in experimental stroke research? First, this method is particularly useful for quantifying infarction in the severely injured,
edematous brain or in research of neonatal cerebral HI, because
it allows post-fixation to produce thin brain slices with clear red
(viable)–white(infarct)colorcontrast.Secondly,byclearlydemarcating live-versus-dead tissue, it can help decipher the signaling
events inside the penumbra area, which is of particular interest
for the development of neuron-salvaging strategies (Sharp et al.,
2000).
In this regard, a recent study has shown that immersion TTC-
staining is compatible with mRNA and protein analysis (Kramer
et al., 2010). Our study further indicates that biochemical analysis
after in vivo TTC-labeling recapitulates many hallmarks of apoptosis in experimental stroke, including the mitochondria leakage of
cytochorme c and cleavage of AIF, as well as, a greater induction
of HSP70 in the peri-infarct area (Fig. 3) (Kinouchi et al., 1993; Cao
et al., 2007). With its ability to demarcate the boundary of infarctionprecisely,invivoTTC-labelingcanassistgenomics–proteomics
analysis of the ischemic penumbra area.
4.4. Age-differential effects of LPS-pretreatment on experimental
stroke
Finally,totesttheutilityof in vivoTTC-labelingmethodinnewborn mice, we confirmed the report that 72h LPS pretreatment
increases HI brain damage in neonates, in contrast to the protective preconditioning effect of 24h LPS pretreatment in neonates
(Eklindetal.,2005;Linetal.,2009)orby24–96hLPSpretreatment
in adults (Tasaki et al., 1997; Rosenzweig et al., 2004). Verification of this finding is important, because although IP injection
of a low-dose LPS (0.3mg/kg) at 4–6h before HI is a popular
paradigm of infection-sensitized neonatal brain injury via the
innateimmunity(Lehnardtetal.,2003),someinvestigatorsremain
critical of the acute LPS-pretreatment paradigm, complaining that
it does not mimic chronic inflammation in intrauterine infection.
By confirming the previous report of intensified HI brain injury
by 72h LPS-pretreatment, our results suggest an additional model
to study the mechanisms and therapies of infection-sensitized HI
brain injury in neonates. However, whether the innate immunity and neonatal inflammatory response remain activated at
72h after LPS pretreatment remains unclear and warrants further
investigation.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, our results demonstrated a mannitol-facilitated
TTC perfusion-labeling method that is a useful alternative to
the ex vivo immersion-labeling method. The in vivo TTC-labeling
method is simple, inexpensive, and particular useful for measuring injury in severely damaged or small newborn brains. This new
vitality-detection method not only simplifies the task of quantifying infarction, but also supports biochemical analysis of the coreand peri-infarct areas in experimental stroke.
