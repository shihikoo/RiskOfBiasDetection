Because of the heterogeneity of human ICH, multiple preclinical models are needed to thoroughly explore pathophysiologic mechanisms and test

Introduction
Intracerebralhemorrhage(ICH)isarelativelycommonformofcerebrovasculardiseasewithapproximately40–50%ofafflictedpatientsdying

1
.Unfortunately,littleimprovementhasbeenmadeinthemortalityrateoverthelast20years
2
. Reports from the National
Institutes of Health 
3
 and guidelines from the American Heart Association 
4
 stressed the importance of developing clinically relevant models of
ICH to extend the understanding of pathophysiology and develop targets for new therapeutic approaches.
Several models exist to mimic human ICH 
5
. As understanding of ICH pathophysiology matures, it has become evident that a variety of models
maybeusedtoexaminedifferentaspectsofthedisease.Previouslyusedmodelsincludemurineamyloidangiopathy

, intraparenchymal

 develop
spontaneous ICH as they age. Study of these animals after ICH development may mimic the disease in the presence of one of the major
comorbidities predisposing humans to ICH. While these other models exist, intrastriatal injection of Clostridial collagenase 
11
 or instrastiatal
injection of autologous whole blood 
12
are,currently,thetwomostcommonmodelsusedinpreclinicalICHresearch.
ICH model selection should be made based on the objective of the experimental question, including species selection and method of inducing
hematoma formation. For instance, pigs are large animals with relatively large white matter brain volumes compared to mice. Thus, porcine

make rodents useful to assess molecular mechanisms of injury and recovery after ICH. Each model has its inherent strengths and weaknesses
(Table 1), which should be carefully considered prior to experimentation.

Representative Results
Duetodifferencesinhematomaformation(Figure 1), ipsilateral turning is shown immediately after wake up for autologous blood injected mice
and within 2 - 4 hr after collagenase injection, as hematoma expansion occurs (Figure 2). Absence of ipsilateral turning should raise concern for
absenceofsignificantinjury.Onthefirstpostinjuryday,miceinbothmodelsshoulddemonstratesignificantneurologicaldeficits(Figure 3). At
24 hr after injection, ipsilateral hemispheres show stable hematoma volumes (Figure 4);further,at24hoursafterinjection,brainwatercontent
should be expected to be 79.8 + 0.34% in collagenase-injected mice and 79.3 + 0.23% in autologous blood-injected mice. Mortality should be
expected to occur between 10 - 25% of collagenase-injected mice and less than 10% of autologous blood-injected mice. Unavoidable death due
to hematoma volume, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure usually occurs within the first 24 - 48 hr after intrastriatal injection.
Death occurring after 72 hr may often be avoided with proper post-injury care (e.g., ready access to softened food and water). Functional
recovery generally begins by post injury day 2 with autologous blood-injected mice recovering significantly faster than collagenase-injected mice.

Discussion
Despite emerging preclinical research and resultant large clinical trials for promising therapeutics 
15-18
, there are no pharmacological
interventions demonstrated to improve outcome in ICH, and care remains largely supportive. Lists of possible therapies may be generated by
high throughput technologies, such as transcriptomic and proteomic work. While these technologies continue to advance our knowledge of
potential therapeutic targets, forward and backward translation of promising targets may be best examined through use of clinically relevant
preclinical models 
19-22
. Such models are useful because they allow rapid throughput of selected candidates, examination of mechanisms in
vivo,inexpensiveinvestigationofdosing,therapeuticwindow,andotherparametersgermanetodevelopingclinicaltrials
23-25
. While obvious
advantages exist in using preclinical models, modeling should occur in the most clinically relevant but logistically feasible system available. While
models exist for 'higher' order animals such as primates, use of mice to model human disease provides an inexpensive, high-throughput, and
powerfultechnologytoexaminingpathologicmechanismsandtherapeuticeffects.Incorporatingtransgenicsystemsallowsforanevenmore
robust evaluation of mechanistic pathways and cell populations involved.
Currently two murine models are in common use: intrastriatal autologous blood or collagenase injection. Both models are versatile and easy
touse,relativetootherstrokemodels.BothmodelscaninduceICHindifferentbrainareas
26
, allowing evaluation of regional responses;
hematoma volume can be controlled and changed, allowing for evaluation of mild, moderate, and severe injury; and clinically relevant physiology
(e.g., blood pressure, temperature, etc.)canbecontrolled.Finally,whileeachmodelwasoriginallydevelopedintherat,bothhavesincebeen
translated into mice to allow the use of transgenic systems 
21,24,25,27
.However,eachmodellendsitselftothestudyofdifferentaspectsofICH,
aseachrepresentsdistinctlydifferentcomponentsofICH.Autologousblood-injectionmayrecreatethebrain'sresponsetointraparenchymal

10,28
.Further,recentmodificationstothismodelhaveresultedintheabilitytomimichematomaexpansion
29,30
.However,thismodeldoesnot
invoke the component of vascular injury and/or hematoma expansion found in the human disease. In contrast, collagenase-injection adds
theelementsofvascularrupture,earlyhematomaexpansion,andenhancedneuroinflammatoryeffect.Whileobviousconcernsexistabout
artifactualcontributionofcollagenasetothisinflammatoryeffect,thereisalackofhardevidenceforthis
31
, and our own (unpublished) data
suggest that collagenase in isolation does not induce a marked inflammatory response in cell culture.
From a procedural standpoint, both models require limited skill with microsurgery and, thus, are easily learned so as to obtain reproducible
effects.Pitfallstobeavoidedinclude:1)invasionoftheduraorcreatingthermalbraininjurywhendrilling,2)orpenetrationoftheventricular
system with needle insertion. Dural injury allows for reflux of injectant, and intraventricular injection results in little to no intraparenchymal
hematomaformation.Further,caremustbetakenuponneedlewithdrawaltonotdisruptnewlyformed/forminghematoma.Mortalityistobe
expected in a certain percentage of mice but is directly related to hematoma size and degree of injury desired; thus, this outcome may be titrated
by injectant volume/concentration.
As with all models, protocols will be optimized for use by specific operators. Due to inherent variability in all in vivo systems, experience with a
particular model as a key factor for success cannot be overstated. A model's distinctive characteristics, operator experience with a given model,
outcome metrics of interest, and logistical factors must all be taken into account when selecting the best possible experimental model.
