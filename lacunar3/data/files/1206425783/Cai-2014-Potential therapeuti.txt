The neurotrophins (NTs) nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT-3, and NT-4/5 are proteins
that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in both the developing and mature central nervous system (CNS) by
binding to two receptor classes, Trk receptors and p75 NTR. Motivated by the broad growth- and survival-promoting effects of these
proteins, numerous studies have attempted to use exogenous NTs to prevent the death of cells that are associated with neurological
disease or promote the regeneration of severed axons caused by mechanical injury. Indeed, such neurotrophic effects have been
repeatedly demonstrated in animal models of stroke, nerve injury, and neurodegenerative disease. However, limitations, including
the short biological half-lives and poor blood-brain permeability of these proteins, prevent routine application from treating human
disease. In this report, we reviewed evidence for the neuroprotective efficacy of NTs in animal models, highlighting outstanding
technical challenges and discussing more recent attempts to harness the neuroprotective capacity of endogenous NTs using small
molecule inducers and cell transplantation.
1. Introduction: Current Challenges in
the Clinical Use of Neurotrophins
Preclinical research over the past 3 decades has described in
immense detail the signaling pathways that lead to neuronal
cell death [1, 2]. Moreover, a plethora of neuroprotective
strategies have been developed for ameliorating brain damage
and preserving or restoring neurological function in
animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson
’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other
neurological disorders [3–5]. Such treatments include the
administration of neurotrophic factors, which are endogenous
proteins critical for proliferation, differentiation, and
survival during development and neuroplasticity throughout
life [6,7]. Indeed, brain delivery of exogenous neurotrophic
factors, such as the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF)
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can reduce
infarct volumes by 60–90% with near total restoration of
behavioral function in experimental stroke models.
Despite this success in the laboratory, there are currently
no broadly effective treatments to reverse or halt the progression
of these diseases in patients.
Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the
failure of neurotrophins in clinical trials, including limited
access of peripherally administered neurotrophins to the
central nerve system (CNS), the short biological half-lives of
neurotrophins, the multimodal nature of disease progression,
and the relatively short temporal window in which such
treatments are effective (at least for acute neural insults such
as stroke) [8]. For example, antistroke therapies must be
instituted within 1–6 h of the event for significant efficacy,
andfewstrokepatientscanbetreatedwithinthistimeframe.
Thus, prophylactic strategies that upregulate endogenous
protective capacity may be needed.

In recent years, methods for delivery of neurotrophins
acrossthebloodbrainbarrier(BBB)haveadvancedrapidly,
as has the development of smaller neurotrophin receptor
(Trk) agonists with significantly longer biological half-lives
and BBB permeability than native neurotrophins like BDNF
(serum half-life of≈10 min) [9]. Perhaps the most difficult
problem is that of delivering these molecules to appropriate
targets, such as astrocyte cells, microglia cells, and vascular
endothelial cells as well as neurons, while limiting exposure
to undamaged brain tissue.
Despitethesechallenges,wemaybeclosetodeveloping
neurotrophin receptor agonists and delivery systems that
allow for rapid brain penetration to protect vulnerable human
neuronsfromcelldeath.Thisgoalmaybefacilitatedbythe
fact that the many distinct pathogenic processes associated
with stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases appear
to converge on several mutually reinforcing final common
pathways: excitotoxicity by excess glutamate receptor stimulation
, intracellular calcium overload, oxidative stress, mitochondrial
failure, and apoptosis. Here, we review evidence
that neurotrophic factors can prevent neuronal death in
acute and chronic brain diseases and highlight the remaining
problems that have thus far prevented clinical application.
2. Neurotrophin-Mediated Protection against
Acute Neural Insult
2.1. Direct Neurotrophin Administration Reduces Stroke Damage. Numerous studies have demonstrated that neurotrophins
, particularly BDNF, reduce infarct volume in rodents
when administered before, during, and/or after experimental
stroke [10]. These studies have used various strategies to
enhancethelevelofBDNFinbrain.Intraventricularinjection
of BDNF for 8 days at the beginning of 24 hours before permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Wistar
rats was found to improve neurological deficits [ 11]. Similarly,
BDNF was delivered into the territory of the MCA by an
osmotic minipump shortly after occlusion reduced cortical
infarct volume by 37% [12]. Infusion of recombinant BDNF
into Sprague-Dawley rat neocortex by an implanted osmotic
minipump 2.5–14 days before, during, and for 2 days following
MCAO reduced infarct volume as measured 2 days after
stroke without affecting cerebral blood flow [ 13]. Continuous
BDNF infusion immediately following 2 h right MCAO in
rats reduced both cortical and subcortical infarct volume as
well as the number of neurons in the ischemic penumbra
expressing the proapoptotic factor Bax, while increasing the
number of neurons expressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 [14]. It was
found that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were rescued
by intraventricular injection of a viral vector encoding
BDNF, as well as similar vectors encoding glial-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF), NGF, insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1), or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 30 min
after the ischemic insult [ 15]. Transplantation of fresh bone
marrow (BM) together with BDNF into the ischemic boundary
zone (IBZ) of the rat brain following MCAO facilitated
functional recovery of sensory and motor functions [16]. The
effects of BDNF on infarct size were synergistic with brain
hypothermia, another well-described antistroke treatment.
Furthermore, postischemic striatal glutamate concentrations
were reduced to a greater extent by combining BDNF and
hypothermia than for either treatment alone [17].
Transplantation of choroid plexus (CP), which is known
to secrete a variety of growth factors including BDNF, GDNF,
and NGF, reduced infarct volume in rats [18]. Injection of
neural progenitors into the hippocampus immediately after
cerebral ischemia increased spatial memory performance in
the Morris water maze (MWM) 12–28 days after cerebral
ischemia and reduced infarct volume. Injection of neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) also reversed the postischemic decline
in BDNF expression [19]. Sodium orthovanadate protected
cortical and hippocampal neurons after experimental subarachnoid
hemorrhage by increasing BDNF and inhibiting
BDNF receptor TrkB inactivation, effects that were abolished
by pretreatment with the TrkB inhibitor K252a [20].
While most of these studies examined infarct formation
or neurological recovery in the early period following
ischemia, a more recent study demonstrated that transplantation
of neural stem cells (NSCs) overexpressing BDNF
improved neurological function as late as 12 weeks after
MCAO [21]. In addition to grey matter damage, BDNF may
also reduce damage caused by lacunar-type stroke in primates
following occlusion of the deep subcortical penetrating
arteries. Moreover, expression of BDNF was stimulated in
the affected white matter following ischemic injury [ 22]. In a
similar study, BDNF did not reduce infarct volume but still
resulted in greater functional recovery following ischemia
compared to controls. In addition, this treatment reduced
astrogliosis, a process that may impede long-term recovery
by blocking regrowth of axons [23].
Conversely,micelackingasingleBDNFalleleorboth
neurotrophin-4 alleles (nt4−/−) exhibited larger cerebral
infarcts than wild-type littermates [24]. Transgenic mice
overexpressing the dominant-negative truncated variant of
the BDNF receptor (TrkB.T1) specifically in cortical and
hippocampal neurons exhibited greater damage in the cortex
but not in regions (striatum) without TrkB.T1 transgene
expression [25]. Infusion of an antisense BDNF oligonucleotide
for 28 days after unilateral cortical ischemia blocked
BDNF mRNA expression and negated the beneficial effects
of motor rehabilitation on the recovery of skilled reaching by
the contralateral limb but had no effect on motor function of
the ipsilateral limb [26].
While neurotrophins are broadly neuroprotective against
experimental stoke, several studies have shown greater efficacy
of one particular neurotrophin over others as well as
superior protection in specific brain regions. Infusion of
BDNF into the substantia nigra (SN) had no effect on survival
of nigrostriatal projection neurons after stroke and even exacerbated
death of some striatal cholinergic and GABAergic
interneurons [27]. Conversely, BDNF may be more effective
than other neurotrophins against stroke-induced damage in
the cortex. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing
either BDNF or GDNF improved functional outcome as
revealed by MRI one and two weeks after MCAO, while
MSCs overexpressing the neurotrophin NT-3 did not [28].
Thus,region-specificadministrationmaybenecessaryforfull

efficacy, and this constitutes a major hurdle for noninvasive
peripheral administration.
2.2. Neurotrophins Mediate the Protective Efficacy of Other
Treatments. The neuroprotective efficacies of many other
manipulations that rescue neurons from stroke damage
are mediated at least in part by enhanced expression of
neurotrophins, particularly BDNF. For example, brief daily
treadmill running for 3 weeks prior to stroke reduced
infarct volumes in the frontoparietal cortex and dorsolateral
striatum, and these effects were correlated with upregulation
of NGF and BDNF in cortical neurons and striatal glia.
In addition, there was a significant increase in microvessel
density in the striatum [29]. The neuroprotective effects of
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) following MCAO may also
be mediated in part by BDNF; FGF-2 null mice exhibited
dramatically larger infarct volumes than wild-type littermates
and a diminished postischemic induction of hippocampal
BDNF and TrkB mRNA [30]. Cortical spreading depression
(SD), which is a wave of depolarization followed by neuronal
quiescence, can induce a preconditioning effect involving
BDNF expression. Induced SD for 6 or 9 days prior to
experimental focal ischemia reduced infarct volume and
resulted in less severe neurological deficits both at one
and 14 days after ischemia. This preconditioning effect was
not observed in heterozygous BDNF-deficient mice [ 31].
Preconditioning can also be achieved by sublethal doses of
N-methyl D-asparate (NMDA), which increased hippocampal
CA1 neuron survival after ischemia, an effect blocked
by the TrkB antagonist K252a [32]. Lithium is another
widely studied neuroprotectant that requires BDNF/TrkB
signaling [33]. Lithium-mediated neuroprotection involves
GSK-3 inhibition, which in turn leads to enhanced BDNF
expression [34]. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) treatment starting
24 h after MCAO also improved functional recovery and
concomitantly increased BDNF expression (as well as VEGF
and VEGFR2) at the ischemic border. In addition, atorvastatin
treatment increased the number of migrating neurons,
synaptophysin-positive cells, and angiogenesis around the
infarct. In vitro, atorvastatin enhanced the migration of 
subventricular zone (SVZ) cells, an effect inhibited by a
BDNF antibody [35].
In addition to invasive methods like cell therapy, brain
concentrations of BDNF can be elevated by orally administered
agents. The rennin-angiotensin system inhibitor
candesartan was found to reduce stroke volume, improve
neurological outcome, and promote TrkB expression [36].
Inhibitors of nitric oxide production may also be effective.
The endothelial cell isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
protected against stroke through BDNF upregulation [37];
eNOS knockout mice exhibited more severe deficits than
wild-type mice following permanent right MCAO, as well
as reduced progenitor cell proliferation and migration from
the SVZ and decreased angiogenesis at the ischemic boarder.
These changes were associated with lower postischemic
BDNF (but no change in VEGF and bFGF expression). Moreover
, neurosphere formation and proliferation and neurite
outgrowth were reduced in cultured SVZ cells derived from
eNOS−/−mice, characteristics reversed by BDNF administration
[37]. Treadmill exercise prior to experimental ischemia
improved motor performance and upregulated BDNF and
TrkB expression in the contralateral hemisphere [38]. Significantly
, enhanced BDNF only occurred following voluntary
exercise, possibly because “forced” exercise enhances serum
corticosterone, which may reduce neurotrophin expression
[39]. Allosteric AMPAR modulators enhanced limb control
when administered several days after stroke, but impaired
recovery when administered immediately. Inhibition of
BDNF function in the cortex preinfarct blocked this motor
rescue [40].
Note,however,thatotherneuroprotectiveeffectsappear
independently of neurotrophin expression. Preconditioning
by sublethal MCAO 3 days prior to (normally) neurotoxic
MCAO protected rats but did not alter expression of most
neurotrophins, though BDNF expression was transiently
reduced [41]. Housing rats in an enriched environment after
experimental stroke was found to enhance recovery, but
this was associated with a decrease in BDNF mRNA and
protein expression, and enriched BDNF(+/−)miceshowed
improved motor function on the rotorod two weeks after
transient MCAO compared to wild-type mice [42]. Enriched
environments thus appear to enhance functional recovery
after ischemic stroke independently of BDNF [ 43].
2.3. Novel Neurotrophin Delivery, Induction, and Targeting
Methods. Several novel delivery systems may allow for noninvasive
neurotrophin administration [44]. A single systemic
administration of BDNF conjugated to the OX26 murine
monoclonal antibody against the transferrin receptor, which
facilitates transport across the BBB via the transferrin receptor
transcytosis system, reduced infarct volume by 70%
(although it had no effect on subcortical stroke volume)
[45].Inanotherstudy,BDNFconjugatedtoatransferrin
receptor antibody reduced infarct volume by 65–70% and
improved rotorod performance [46]. High-voltage electric
potential (HELP) stimulation of adult mice also enhanced
BDNF levels, increased resistance to cerebral infarction,
and improved escape latency in the MWM [47]. BDNF
engineered to bind laminin, which is highly expressed in
the ischemic brain, reduced infarct volume and improved
neurological function as well as neurogenesis in the dentate
gyrus [48]. Intranasal BDNF 2 h after reperfusion reduced
the number of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) neurons (but
not infarct volume). This BDNF application also enhanced
microglial activation (as indicated by OX-42 expression) and
the number of phagocytotic microglia (ED1-positive), suppressed
tumor necrosis factor-�� expression, and enhanced
expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10
[49].
In addition to novel delivery/targeting systems for native
BDNF, there have been extensive efforts to develop small
mimetics with superior pharmacokinetic properties and
BBB permeability [9]. For example, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone,
a high-affinity TrkB agonist, was found to inhibit kainic
acid-induced toxicity, decrease infarct volume following
experimental stroke in a TrkB-dependent manner, and be

neuroprotectiveinananimalmodelofParkinson’sdisease
[50].
2.4. Neuroprotection by Natural Neurotrophin Inducers. Several
natural compounds have demonstrated neuroprotective
efficacy mediated in part by BDNF upregulation. The
plant flavonoids baicalin and jasminoidin in combination
promoted BDNF expression and inhibited the apoptotic
effector caspase-3 [ 51]. Niacin also increased BDNF and
TrkB expression in neurons and reduced infarct volume
in vivo following experimental stroke [52]. Infusion of
galectin-1, an endogenous mammalian lectin, enhanced the
expression and secretion of astrocytic BDNF, reduced the
number of apoptotic neurons at the ischemic boundary,
and improved functional recovery after experimental stroke
[53]. p-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), an active component
of gastrodia elata blume, administered 1 h before MCAO,
decreased infarct volume, promoted functional recovery as
measured by the modified neurological severity score, and
enhanced Nrf2, BDNF, GDNF, and MBP expression levels
[54].
2.5. Mechanisms of Neurotrophin-Mediated Neuroprotection.
Oxidative stress and intracellular-free calcium dysregulation
are mutually reinforcing early events that lead to neuronal
death following stroke [2]. Thus, much stroke research
has focused on developing strategies to reduce free radical
accumulation, augment cellular antioxidant defenses, chelate
intracellular calcium, or interfere with upstream events such
as excess glutamate receptor stimulation (excitotoxicity) in
the ischemic brain [3]. There is an emerging consensus
that inflammation is also critical in stroke pathogenesis [ 5],
indicating that anti-inflammatory drugs are feasible therapeutic
options. It is thus noteworthy that neurotrophins like
BDNF can stabilize intracellular calcium, induce antioxidant
enzyme expression, and suppress the release of proinflammatory
cytokines [4,55]. One mechanism of BDNF-induced
protection relevant to both acute and chronic models of
neurological disease is preservation of mitochondrial function.
BDNF (but not GDNF or NGF) substantially increased
the respiratory control index (RCI, a measure of respiratory
coupling efficiency and ATP synthesis) in synaptosomes [ 56]
but not in pure mitochondria nor in synaptosomes treated
with an inhibitor of complex I, suggesting that activity of
a TrkB-associated signaling pathway is necessary. Indeed,
the effect was also blocked by inhibitors of the MEK-Bcl-
2 pathway, the major pathway implicated in BDNF-TrkB-
dependent neuroprotection [56].
Another possible mechanism for these neuroprotective
effects is enhanced neurogenesis and migration of neural
precursor cells (NPCs) from the SVZ. Daily intravenous
bolus applications of BDNF after stroke resulted in significantly
improved sensorimotor scores 6 weeks after stoke
as well as enhanced neurogenesis in the DG and SVZ
[57]. Continuous intraventricular BDNF infusion for two
weeks enhanced the number of proliferating (doublecortinpositive
) SVZ cells surrounding the lesion 14 and 42 days
after stoke [ 58]. Mobilization of this endogenous cell pool
reduces stroke damage. Blockade of NPC proliferation by
infusion of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) for the first 7
days after brain ischemia enlarged the infarct volume and
exacerbated postischemic neurological deficits. Moreover,
if BDNF and VEGF were inactivated, NSCs cultured in
the ischemic brain conditioned media lost neuroprotective
efficacy [ 59]. Transplantation of human bone marrow stem
cells (BMSCs) in rats after MCAO resulted in elevated BDNF,
NT-3, and VEGF, enhanced endogenous NPC proliferation in
both the SVZ and hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ), and
promoted NPC migration to the ischemic boundary [60].
2.6. Endogenous Signaling Pathways for Neurotrophin Induction. BDNF is widely expressed throughout the CNS and
by most cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia,
and vascular endothelial cells. The classical induction mechanism
involves calcium influx and phosphoactivation of the
transcription factor CREB. CREB can be activated by factors
released by the ischemic brain, thereby coupling BDNF synthesis
and release to metabolic status. The phosphodiesterase
inhibitor cilostazol increased the number of doublecortinpositive
NPCs expressing phosphoactivated CREB (pCREB)
and BDNF-expressing astrocytes in the ipsilateral SVZ and
peri-infarct area [61]. Bone-marrow-derived stem cells cultured
in ischemic brain-conditioned medium for 12 h—
but not BMCs cultured in media from normoxic brain—
were transformed from polygonal to fibroblast-like. This
morphological change was associated with induction of 7
neurotrophic and growth factor genes and 5 receptor genes—
that is, FGF-2, ILG-1, VEGF A, NGFb, and BDNF—and
epidermal growth factor [62].
Therefore, many factors released from the ischemic brain
may be compensatory protective signals that could potentially
be exploited for neuroprotection. Epithelial cells release
neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, in response to these
factors. Conditioned media from cerebral endothelial cells
protected neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation in
vitro, and this effect was blocked when condition medium
was treated with free TrkB-Fc [63]. Human MSCs cultured
in ischemic rat brain extract also exhibited increased
production of BDNF, VEGF, and hepatocyte growth factor
[64]. Stimulated microglial cells are also a source of BDNF;
downregulation of the microglial response to ischemia
by inhibiting the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)
pathway reduced BDNF production as well as markers of
synaptogenesis [65]. Moreover, transplantation of a human
microglial cell line—HMO6—48 hours after MCAO was
found to reduce infarct volume and the number of apoptotic
cells in the penumbra, while also reducing the number of host
microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes. Transplanted
HMO6 microglia also exhibited elevated GDNF, BDNF,
VEGF, BMP7, and anti-inflammatory cytokines [ 66].
2.7. Summary. Enhanced neurotrophin expression in the
CNS is broadly neuroprotective against acute neurological
insults, including ischemia and hemorrhage. Moreover, there
are a plethora of ways to increase brain neurotrophin activity,
including direct infusion, transplantation of cells that express

neurotrophins when exposed to the CNS environment or that
are engineered to overexpress neurotrophins constitutively,
small molecule mimetics, and neurotrophin inducers. The
latter category of molecules presents particularly promising
targets for future research, both to enhance basal ischemic
tolerance and to aid in recovery following transient ischemia.
Extracellular signals released by the ischemic brain also
enhance neurotrophin expression. These as yet unidentified
signaling pathways may also be exploited for neuroprotection.
It should be noted, however, that neuroplastic changes
associated with acute and chronic diseases may reduce the
efficacy of these treatments (see Section 3.2).
3. Neurotrophins for Treatment of
Chronic Neurodegenerative Diseases
There is strong evidence that many of the pathogenic mechanisms
implicated in acute neurodegenerative diseases, such as
oxidative stress and inflammation, are equally involved in the
slower neuronal loss characteristic of chronic neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s
disease (PD), various tauopathies, and Huntington’s disease
(HD). Therefore, the therapeutic promise of neurotrophins
for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases is
based in part on studies demonstrating suppression of these
basic pathogenic mechanisms. Indeed, exogenous application
of neurotrophins protects against neurodegeneration in
animal models of AD, PD, and HD. A multitude of studies
have also demonstrated that expression of neurotrophins
and/or Trk receptors is reduced in the afflicted brain regions
of patients and animal models. In fact, this reduction
may be observed prior to symptom expression, suggesting
that insufficient trophic activity may initiate or accelerate
disease progression. Moreover, neurotrophins often restore
or improve function in animal models in the absence of
observable neuroprotection, indicating that these agents or
mimetics may be therapeutically useful even in patients with
advanced disease.
3.1. Therapeutic Efficacy of NTs, Mimetics, and Inducers
in Animal Models of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disease.
Animal models of chronic neurodegenerative diseases have
demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of neurotrophins, particularly
BDNF. Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form
of age-related dementia, is characterized by accumulation
of extracellular amyloid plaques of beta-amyloids (A�� )and
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated
variants of the cytoskeleton-associated protein
tau. BDNF was found to protect cultured neurons against the
cytotoxic A�� fragments A�� (1–42) and A�� (25–35), and this
protection was inhibited by the TrkB inhibitor K252a [67].
One of the most comprehensive studies on the protective
efficacy of BDNF in animal models of AD found that
injection of a lentivirus vector encoding BDNF into the
entorhinal cortex (EC) improved spatial and fear memory in
J20 transgenic mice expressing the mutant human amyloid
precursor protein (APP), rescued EC neurons in monkeys
subjected to perforant path lesions, and improved learning in
delayed matching object-and-location task in aged monkeys.
In this same study, direct infusion of BDNF into the EC also
improved spatial memory in aged rats [68]. Infection with
a viral vector encoding BDNF was found to enhance BDNF
expression and improve memory deficits in the Tg2576 transgenic
mouse model of AD. Significantly, the vector used—
Sendai virus (SeV)—is highly infective but does not integrate
into the host genome and is nonpathogenic in humans.
Thus, SeV vectors hold great potential for the safe delivery
of neuroprotective peptides to the brain [69]. In addition
to neuroprotection, BDNF may slow disease progression by
inhibiting amyloid production. BDNF was found to induce
the expression of sorting protein-related receptor with A-
type repeats (SORLA), a protein that reduces APP processing
and plaque formation, and no longer reduce A�� in SORLA-
deficient mice [ 70].
In aged 3xTg-AD mice, a model exhibiting amyloid
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and age-associated cognitive
decline, the injection of NSCs into the bilateral hippocampus
improved spatial memory in the MWM but did not reduce
amyloid or tau pathology. Preservation of cognitive function
effect was absent when BDNF expression was knocked down
using a targeted shRNA [71]. The fact that BDNF can improve
cognitive function without reducing neuropathology suggeststhatthisstrategymaybeusefulinadvancedADpatients.
Cognitive dysfunction in AD arises in part from the
loss of septal cholinergic neurons that are project to the
hippocampus. Toxic A�� (1–42) induced the death of septal
neurons in vitro, and this effect was reduced by BDNF 
(as well as by IGF-1and GDNF) and by coculture of 
septal neurons with NSCs overexpressing neurotrophins [72].
The cholinergic neurotoxin (192) IgG-saporin reduced both
MWM performance in rats and BDNF expression, while the
reversal of these effects by the clinical cholinesterase inhibitor
galantamine was associated with enhanced hippocampal
BDNF levels [73].
Transgenic mice overexpressing APP and infected with
a lentiviral BDNF vector at 2 months of age showed significantly
reduced neurodegeneration in the EC and improved
fear memory at 7 months of age [74], indicating that these
therapeutic effects are relatively long-lasting. BDNF may also
preserve neuronal viability and function in AD and other
tauopathies by reducing tau phosphorylation. Indeed, BDNF
reduced phosphorylation at multiple sites, an effect blocked
by inhibition of TrkB, PI-3 kinase, and GSK3�� [75]. The
TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone rescued deficient spatial
working memory in 5XFAD mice and reduced expression
levels of�� -secretase (BACE1), A�� (1–40), and A�� (1–42) [76].
In accord with the aforementioned results on neuroprotective
strategies against stroke-induced neuronal damage,
many potentially effective treatments for AD may be mediated
by enhanced BDNF signaling. A curcumin derivative,
J147, increased BDNF expression and reduced A�� (1–42) and
A�� (1–40) in aged AD mice (APP/swePS1ΔE9). Furthermore,
these changes were associated with enhanced long-term
potentiation, a putative neurocellular mechanism for associativelearning
,andareductioninoxidativestress[ 77]. In
another study, J147 improved both spatial and fear memory
in aged AD mice and upregulated NGF, BDNF, and several
(8.0.0.2542.1106804190 PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSIOn)
6 BioMed Research International
synaptic proteins induced by BDNF, including homer-1, a
protein critical for the trafficking of glutamate receptors. 
Moreover, J147 was shown to be nontoxic at millimolar
serum concentrations while demonstrating neuroprotection
in nanomolar doses in vitro [78]. Elevated A�� reduced the
colocalization of the synaptic marker synaptophysin with
AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR4. As trafficking
of AMPA receptors underlies forms of synaptic plasticity
linked to learning, this disruption may explain the learning
deficits associated with AD. Furthermore, exogenous BDNF
was found to restore synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking
[79].
Sildenafil (Viagra) also rescued cognitive function in
the AD model mice, but without reducing the amyloid
burden [80]. The neuroprotective effects of NPY in vitro
against toxic A�� fragments were also found to be associated
with neurotrophin upregulation [81]. The antidepressant
amitriptyline enhanced BDNF and TrkB expression in the
hippocampus, promoted neurogenesis, and improved spatial
and object recognition memory in aged 3xTg mice [82]. The
multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod phosphate (a sphingosine-
1-phosphate receptor agonist) enhanced BDNF expression
and protected mouse cortical neurons against A�� toxicity,
an effect blocked by inhibition of BDNF-TrkB-ERK signaling
[83]. Neuropep-1 is a new BDNF inducer that rescued spatial
memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. In addition, Neuropep-1
also reduced the A�� burden, possibly by enhancing expression
of the insulin/A�� -degrading enzyme [84]. Sodium
phenylbutyrate (NaPB) induced BDNF and NT-3 expression
in astrocytes by activating the PKC-CREB signaling pathway
and improved spatial learning and memory in a mouse model
of AD [85].
Significant neuroprotective effects of neurotrophins,
particularly BDNF, have also been demonstrated in animal
models of PD. Intrathecal infusion of BDNF suppressed
Parkinsonian signs in monkeys one week after treatment
with the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which selectively destroys
dopaminergic neurons and is widely used to model PD
pathology. Moreover, BDNF infusion reduced neuronal loss
in the SN and the extent of rescue was correlated with the
preservation of function [86]. Transplantation of astrocytes
expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and/or BDNF blocked
6-OHDA-induced degeneration and the effect of TH plus
BDNF was more effective than either alone [ 87]. Injection
ofaBDNFviralvectordidnotincreaseTH-positiveSN
neurons six months after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) injection but did block amphetamine-induced
ipsilateral rotation [88], a PD-like behavior. Transplantation
ofratfibroblastssecretinghumanBDNFneartheSNprior
to striatal MPP+ administration enhanced neuronal survival
compared to transplantation of wild-type fibroblasts [ 89].
Other PD treatment strategies are associated with
BDNF induction. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) rescued DA neurons, improved locomotor function
, and induced expression of BDNF, GDNF, PDNF, and
VEGF in the 6-OHDA model of PD [90]. Similar to results
in stroke models, prior exercise reduced Parkinsonian behavior
(apomorphine-induced rotations), rescued dopaminergic
neurons, and reversed the early reduction in BDNF expression
observed following PD model induction. Neuronal rescue
was reduced by inhibition of BDNF signaling [91]. Prior
exercise (4 weeks) also reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons
and improved motor function following intraperitoneal
injection of the activator of inflammation lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), an effect blocked by a TrkB antagonist and mimicked
by intracerebral perfusion of BDNF [92]. Successful motor
rehabilitation also increased serum BDNF in PD patients
[93]. The therapeutic efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS)
targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), a widely used
PD treatment, may also depend on BDNF induction; STNDBS
increased BDNF but not GDNF expression in the SN,
striatum, motor cortex (M1), and hippocampus—an effect
that was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist [94]. A
diet high in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)
also protected against MPTP-induced death of dopaminergic
neurons and induced striatal expression of BDNF [95].
Pretreatment with the ampakine and BDNF inducer CX614
significantlyreducedMPP(+)-inducedtoxicityinbrainslices,
an effect blocked by an inhibitor of TrkB [ 96]. Another novel
neurotrophin inducer, PYM50028, also reduced the loss of
SN dopaminergic neurons in mice when administered after
MPTP [97].
3.2.IsDysregulationofNeurotrophinInvolvedinthePathogenesis
of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disease? Deficient neurotrophin
signaling has also been implicated in neurodegenerative
disease progression. A�� reduction in neurotrophin
expression in vulnerable brain regions has been widely
reported, while genetic association studies have identified
specific neurotrophin gene alleles as risk factors [ 98]. As
discussed below, however, many of these studies also indicate
that pathogenic processes may interfere with neurotrophin
signaling and thereby reduce the effects of exogenous neurotrophin
administration.
Expression levels of neurotrophins and Trk receptors
are altered in neurodegenerative diseases, but the functional
implications are currently unclear. The large-scale Framingham
Study found a specific association between lowserum
BDNF and dementia/AD risk in elderly women [99].
ReducedBDNFlevelswerealsoobservedinthecortexof
female APdE8 AD model mice [100]. A comparison of several
transgenic AD model mice revealed that cortical BDNF
mRNA expression was reduced in two models—namely,
APP(NLh) and TgCRND8—compared to wild types, and
all models studies exhibited an inverse correlation between
toxic A�� levels and BDNF expression [101]. In aged model
mice, however, BDNF immunoreactivity was elevated around
amyloid plaques [100]. It was suggested that this elevation
could act to sequester BDNF and reduce BDNF-TrkB signaling.
Alternatively, it may represent a reactive response
to damage. In situ hybridization also showed a several-fold
increase in BDNF mRNA around amyloid plaques due to
elevated microglial and astrocytic expression [102].
Despite uncertainties concerning brain neurotrophin
levels during the different phases of neurodegenerative
disorders, there is substantial evidence that neurotrophin
(DEMO PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1212109932)
BioMed Research International 7
signaling is disrupted in AD and PD. For instance, A��
can also alter the expression of TrkB isoforms [103]. In
cultured neurons, sublethal doses of A�� inhibited BDNFMAPK
/ERK and BDNF-PI3-K signaling by interfering with
insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc, two docking proteins
that link TrkB to the activation of downstream kinase cascades
[104]. In addition, A�� treatment increased truncated
TrkB.T1 and decreased full-length TrkB.TK expression in
cultured neurons; furthermore, overexpression of TrkB.T1
in APdE9 mice enhanced cognitive deficits [ 105]. The AD-
linked gene presenilin 1 can also regulate surface expression
of TrkB [106]. Amyloid-�� accumulation also interfered with
CREB activation, while viral delivery of CREB-binding protein
(CBP) restored CREB function and improved memory
deficits in an AD model. These changes were associated with
elevatedBDNFbutnoreductioninA�� or tau pathology [107].
Finally, the Tg2576 mouse exhibited reduced retrograde
axonal transport of BDNF that was mitigated by inhibition of
�� -secretase, implicating A�� accumulation in reduced BDNF-
nuclear signaling. Moreover, the administration of A�� alone
reduced retrograde transport [108]. This deficit may stem
from deficient expression of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase
L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme reduced in AD, as a
UCH-ILinhibitoralsoreducedretrogradetransportofBDNF
[109]. Inhibition of BDNF signaling independent of BDNF
expression levels may be a major impediment to the clinical
application of techniques that only augment endogenous
BDNF or TrkB.
This disruption of neurotrophin signaling could further
exacerbate neuronal injury. AD patients expressing the Met
allele of BDNF showed enhanced atrophy in several brain
regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate
cortex, and precuneus, compared to Val/Val carriers [110].
Several SNPs in the BDNF gene were associated with more
rapid brain atrophy over two years [111]. Carriers of both the
BDNFMetalleleandtheADriskfactorAPOE��4 exhibited
enhanced degeneration in the precuneus, orbitofrontal
cortex, gyrus rectus, and lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as
episodic memory deficits that were correlated with amyloid
burden [112]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of studies on the
BDNF 196A/G polymorphism and AD risk reported a significant
association in females [113]. Carriers of the Met allele
also showed faster cognitive decline and greater brain atrophy
over 36 months compared to Val/Val carriers; however, this
only occurred in elderly adults with high basal A�� at the
start of the study, suggesting that neurotrophin dysregulation
accelerates rather than initiates neurodegeneration in AD
[114].
Deficient BDNF signaling is also implicated in PD and
HD progression. In the substantia nigra of PD patients,
BDNF expression is reduced, even in surviving neurons 
[115,116]. BDNF is also reduced in Huntington’s disease, and
BDNF expression is necessary for the survival of mediumsized
spiny striatal neurons lost during HD progression [117].
Continuous infusion of a BDNF antisense oligonucleotide
into the SN of rats induced Parkinsonian behaviors, including
apomorphine-evoked rotation, and resulted in the loss of TH-
positive neurons and dopamine uptake [118]. Mice lacking
BDNF expression in the mid- and hindbrain demonstrated
motor impairments and reduced numbers of TH-positive
neurons, while no reduction was observed in the calbindinand
calretinin-positive neurons spared in PD [119]. Exercise
mitigated Parkinsonian signs, improved mitochondrial function
, and elevated BDNF/GDNF expression in a mouse PD
model [120].ReducedTrkBexpressionreducedthenumber
of SN neurons in elderly mice (21–23 months old) and
resulted in accumulation of alpha-synuclein in surviving
neurons [121].AgedTrkBhypomorphicmicewerehypersensitive
to MPTP and showed enhanced age-related loss
of dopaminergic neurons in the SN [122]. Finally, nigral
dopaminergic neurons expressing TrkB were more resistant
to MPTP than neurons expressing mainly TrkC [123].
4. Conclusions and Future Directions
These studies indicate that neurotrophins can protect neurons
against a variety of pathological insults, including
ischemia and neurotoxins such as A�� .Moreover,avariety
of innovative methods have been developed to noninvasively
enhance neurotrophin expression in the brain. Despite these
advances, neither neurotrophin delivery nor induction is
used in the clinic as a routine treatment. All of these disorders
are associated with multiple pathogenic processes, so it is
possible that effective treatment will require multiple complementary
strategies. Furthermore, these disorders appear
to disrupt neurotrophin signaling, so future work should
concentrate on the targeted delivery of neurotrophins to
vulnerable tissues and methods of preserving neurotrophin
function in the diseased brain.
