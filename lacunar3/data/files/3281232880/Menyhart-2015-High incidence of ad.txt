Spreading depolarization

Spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur spontaneously in the brain after stroke, exacerbate ischemic
injury, and thus emerge as a potential target of intervention. Aging predicts worse outcome from stroke;
yet, the impact of age on SD evolution is not clear. Cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral common
carotid artery occlusion in young (8e9 weeks old, n ¼ 8) and old (2 year olds, n ¼ 6) anesthetized rats.
Sham-operated animals of both age groups served as control (n¼ 12). Electrocorticogram, direct current
potential, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) variations were acquired via a small craniotomy above the
parietal cortex. SDs were elicited by KCl through a second craniotomy distal to the recording site.
Ischemia and age delayed the recovery from SD. CBF decreased progressively during ischemia in the old
animals selectively, and inverse neurovascular coupling with SD evolved in the old but not in the young
ischemic group. We propose that (mal)adaptation of cerebrovascular function with aging impairs the SD-
related CBF response, which is implicated in the intensified expansion of ischemic damage in the old
brain.

1. Introduction
Aging emerges as a major independent risk factor for the incidence
and prevalence of ischemic stroke and predicts poor patient
outcomes (Chen et al., 2010; Liu and McCullough, 2012). Considering
our aging population, it is becoming ever more urgent to
identify targets for therapeutic intervention to restrain the evolution
of ischemic brain injury and improve stroke outcome. Much of
the primary damage in the acute phase of ischemic stroke may
prove irreversible despite prompt intervention, yet the management
of secondary pathophysiological processes is more feasible
and of fundamental importance to improve the prospect of successful
recovery.
Recurrent spreading depolarizations (SDs) spontaneously occur
in the cerebral cortex for at least over a week after the surgical
intervention for the alleviation of primary injury in subarachnoid
hemorrhage, malignant stroke, and traumatic brain injury patients
(Dohmen et al., 2008; Dreier et al., 2006; Hartings et al., 2009).
Moreover, SD has been recognized to contribute to the progression
of delayed ischemic neurological deficit, and it has become
increasingly clear that the occurrence of SD predicts worse clinical
outcome from neurological casualties (Dreier et al., 2006; Hartings
et al., 2011). SD, therefore, emerges as an important secondary
pathogenic phenomenon in the injured brain as it has a considerable
impact on lesion progression and may become a target of
therapeutic strategies.
SD is a wave of intense depolarization that propagates across the
cerebral gray matter and is typically followed by local changes in
cerebral blood flow (CBF). The characteristic features of SD are a
large, transient negative shift in the slow electrical potential (direct
current potential), and the simultaneous silencing of brain electrical
activity (Hartings et al., 2009; Leão,1944; Strong et al., 2002). At the
level of the nervous tissue, SD is a self-igniting cellular ionic
imbalance of a critical mass of neurons and glia cells, which propagates
across the gray matter at a rate of 2e6 mm/min (Somjen,
2001). When neurovascular coupling is intact, SD is associated
with a CBF response containing an obvious functional hyperemic
element (Hansen et al., 1980). Conversely, when neurovascular
coupling is compromised (e.g., by ischemia), the SD-related hemodynamic
response becomes atypical, shifting to dominant
vasoconstriction (Dreier et al., 1998). This atypical CBF variation
during ischemia is believed to aggravate metabolic supply-demand
mismatch in the tissue (Dreier, 2011; Hoffmann and Ayata, 2013)
and is thought to mediate the SD-related expansion of ischemic
brain injury.

Aging was associated with the increased conversion of penumbra
into infarction in patients (Ay et al., 2005), more severe
ischemia-related neurological impairment in old mice, (Liu et al.,
2009), and accelerated infarct development and neuronal degeneration
in old rats (Popa-Wagner et al., 2007). Although SD may be
implicated in all these events, the impact of aging on SD evolution,
and the potential role SD might play in the age-related worsening of
stroke outcome, have remained largely unexplored (Farkas and
Bari, 2014).
Our group has recently made an important discovery that prolonged
SDs and associated hypoperfusion likely compromise
cortical tissue exposed to focal ischemia in aged rats (Clark et al.,
2014). Following up on our previous work, here, we set out to
determine the impact of age on the evolution of SD and the kinetics
of the associated changes in local CBF in the intact and ischemic rat
brain. We introduce an experimental model in which the degree of
cerebral ischemia is highly reproducible, and SDs can be elicited in a
planned, controlled fashion. These conditions enable the accurate
evaluation of how SD evolves in the old ischemic rat brain with
respect to young control.
As an addition, we introduce a detailed analysis of the electrocorticogram
(ECoG) to identify specific frequency bands that may
be selectively affected by SD, and to test whether spectral analysis
of the ECoG can be used as a predictor for SD causing worse recovery
from ischemia.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Surgical procedures
Experimental procedures were performed with the approval of
the National Scientific Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation
(updated Law and Regulations on Animal Protection: 40/
2013. (II. 14.) Government of Hungary), following the EU Directive
2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific
purposes.
Adult, male Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats of 2 age groups
(2 month olds, and 2 year olds, n ¼ 26) were anesthetized with
halothane or isoflurane (1.5%e2.2%, in N2O:O2/2:1) and allowed to
breathe spontaneously through a head mask. Body temperature
was kept between 37.1C and 37.3 C using a heating pad, feedbackcontrolled
by a flexible rectal probe (Homeothermic Blanket System
, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, USA). The left femoral artery
was cannulated for the continuous monitoring of mean arterial
blood pressure (MABP; RX104A, TSD104A, Biopac Systems, Inc,
Goleta, USA). Both common carotid arteries were exposed through
a ventral cervical incision. A silicone-coated fishing line used as
occluder was looped around each artery for later induction of acute,
incomplete, global forebrain ischemia. Animals were placed into a
stereotactic frame, and 2 craniotomies were prepared on the right
parietal bone (3 mm caudal 5 mm lateral and 7 mm 
caudal 5 mm lateral from bregma) with a high precision dental
drill (Technobox 810, Bien-Air Dental SA, Bienne, Switzerland). The
dura in each craniotomy was carefully incised, and the craniotomies
were regularly irrigated with physiological saline.
2.2. Ischemia induction and SD elicitation
Ischemia induction was preceded by a 10-minute baseline
period, during which all variables were continuously recorded.
Acute global forebrain ischemia was induced by pulling on the
occluder lines looped around the common carotid arteries and
securing them in place (“two-vessel occlusion”, 2VO) in a young
and in an old group of rats (young 2VO, n¼ 8; and old 2VO, n¼ 6).
In an age-matched young group used as control for the surgical
procedures, the occluders were in place but not pulled on (young
control, n ¼ 6). For the old age-matched control group, acute 2VO
was not implemented either; instead, animals had undergone
permanent 2VO produced 1-year prior SD elicitation (old control,
n ¼ 6).
Recurrent SDs in all groups were triggered by placing a 1M KClsoaked
cotton ball on the exposed cortical surface in the caudal
cranial window 10 minutes after 2VO onset. In old rats,1M KCl often
proved insufficient to trigger SD, therefore, either 3M KCl was used,
ordif still inefficientda tiny KCl crystal was placed on the cortical
surface to achieve SD elicitation. Experiments were terminated by
the overdose of the anesthetic agent.
2.3. Electrophysiology
In the rostral craniotomy, slow cortical or direct current (DC)
potential and ECoG were acquired through a glass capillary electrode
(20 mm outside tip diameter) filled with saline, implanted
1e1.2 mm deep into the cerebral cortex. An Ag/AgCl reference
electrode was placed subcutaneously in the neck. DC potential and
ECoG were recorded via a high-input impedance preamplifier
(NL102G, NeuroLog System, Digitimer Ltd Welwyn Garden City,
Hertfordshire, England), connected to a differential amplifier
(NL106, NeuroLog System, Digitimer Ltd) with associatedfilter and
conditioner system (NL125, NL530,Digitimer Ltd, NeuroLog System
). Potential line frequency noise (50 Hz) was removed by a highquality
noise eliminator (HumBug, Quest Scientific Instruments Inc,
North Vancouver, Canada) without any signal attenuation. Signals
were acquired at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Analog to digital
conversion was performed by a dedicated data acquisition system
(MP 150, Biopac Systems, Inc).
Data analysis was assisted by the inbuilt instructions of the
software AcqKnowledge 4.2 for MP 150 (Biopac Systems, Inc). For
each SD, the amplitudes of depolarization and hyperpolarization
were defined as the maximum of the negative and positive shift
relative to baseline in DC potential, respectively and were expressed
in mV. The maximum rates of depolarization and repolarization
were calculated as the respective slopes of the SD-related DC shift
given in mV/s. The duration of SD events was measured at half
amplitude of the SD-related negative DC shift in seconds.
2.4. Monitoring of local CBF
SD-associated changes in local CBF adjacent to the glass capillary
electrode were recorded by using laser-Dopplerflowmetry (LDF). A
stainless steel needle Doppler probe (Probe 403, connected to
Periflux 5000, Perimed UK Ltd, Bury St Edmunds, UK) was positioned
at an angle with a micromanipulator close to the penetration
point of the glass capillary electrode. Care was taken to avoid large
pial vessels. The LDF signal was digitized together with the DC
potential and ECoG as described previously (MP 150, Biopac Systems
, Inc).
All variables (i.e., DC potential, ECoG, LDF signal, and MABP)
were simultaneously acquired, displayed live, and stored using a
personal computer equipped with a dedicated software (Acq-
Knowledge 4.2 for MP 150, Biopac Systems, Inc).
Six types of hemodynamic responses were identified, ranging
from dominating hyperemia to prolonged cortical spreading
ischemia with intermediate forms. The CBF response to each SD was
classified accordingly, and the prevalence of various CBF response
types was determined for each experimental group.
SD-associated relative changes in local CBF were calculated
based on 100% baseline taken shortly before SD occurrence and
residual LDF signal after anesthetic overdose considered as biological
zero. The magnitude of each element of the SD-related CBF

response (i.e., initial hypoperfusion, transient hyperemia, prolonged
oligemia) was expressed relative to baseline (%). The duration
of early hypoperfusion and subsequent transient hyperemia
was measured at half amplitude of the initial hypoemic drop and
hyperemic peak.
2.5. Spectral analysis of ECoGs
The analysis was carried out to reveal whether the dynamics of
SD-related electrical silence of neural activity is selective for specific frequency ranges, and what impact ischemia might exert on
these parameters. Only the young control and young 2VO groups
were included in the analysis because the ECoG of the old animals
was excessively noisy. The 4 conventional frequency ranges (i.e.,
alpha: 8e13 Hz; beta: 13e30 Hz; delta: 0.5e3 Hz; and theta:
3e8 Hz) that covered the full spectrum up to 30 Hz (the effective
edge of low-passfiltering of the ECoG) were treated separately. All
spectral calculations were carried out in a self-developed .NET
environment written in C#. Fast Fourier transforms were calculated
using a .NET wrapper around FFTW (the Fastest Fourier Transform
in the West,http://www.fftw.org/). The Task Parallel Library offered
by .NET was also used to speed up calculations.
The basis of the spectral investigations is the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) of the relevant ECoG sequencefεkgN1

The integrated spectral powers follow a trench-like profile
during an SD episode. These trench profiles were modeled as a
series of straight-line segments. The 4 breakpoints bounding the
downward and upward segments were marked manually, then a
parallel search was carried out in the neighborhood of these initial
breakpoints to find the positions for which the least-squares fitof
these segments provides the least residual sum of squares. The
baseline (first) and recovery (last) segments were always horizontal
and 60 seconds long, representing the mean spectral power
before and after the SD, respectively. Finally, to produce a contiguous
segment sequence, each segment was extended or reduced to
the point where it intersects the neighboring segment. The
parameters obtained from the trench profiles were the following:
➀ level of baseline (the mean spectral power for the 60-second
interval preceding the onset of an SD); ➁ slope of depression
(the slope of the downward segment); ➂ level of depression
(the arithmetic mean between the endpoints of the downward and
upward segments); ➃ duration of depression (expressed in seconds
);➄ slope of recovery (the slope of the upward segment);➅
level of recovery (the mean spectral power for the 60-second interval
following recovery).
Alpha-to-delta ratio (ADR) has been reported to represent
neural activity: lower values were taken as a predictor of worse
recovery from ischemia in patients (Claassen et al., 2004).
Therefore, ADR values were calculated for the 3 horizontal segments
(i.e., baseline, depression, and recovery) as simply the ratio
of the integrated power of the alpha range to that of the delta
range:
ADRs ¼
Pa; s
Pd; s
;
wherein, the index s indicates the segment for which the ADR is
calculated (baseline, depression, or recovery), and P stands for the
integrated alpha or delta power for the given segment (e.g., Pa; 1 is
the level of baseline for the alpha trench profile while Pd; 3
denotes
the level of recovery in the delta trench profile).
2.6. Statistical analysis
Data are given as mean  standard deviation for parametric
data, and median (interquartile range 95%) for nonparametric data.
The software SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) was used for statistical analysis. A one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) paradigm followed by a Fisher post
hoc test was applied for the evaluation of data derived from the DC
potential, and the duration of transient hyperemia. The prevalence
of CBF response types across experimental groups was evaluated
with the nonparametric Fisher’s exact test. The magnitude of the
elements of the CBF response, the SD-related changes in the integrated
power of the 4 frequency ranges of the ECoG, and the temporal
changes in ADR were tested with repeated measures ANOVA.
Data obtained by the spectral analysis of ECoG were tested by a
multivariate ANOVA paradigm, followed by a Fisher post hoc test.
Correlation analysis between the duration of the SD-related negative
shift in DC potential and transient hyperemia was performed
with Spearman correlation analysis. Level of confidence was given
as *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.
3. Results
3.1. Mean arterial blood pressure and CBF variations in the ischemia
model used
Baseline MABP values were similar across all groups (95 
3.6 mm Hg), followed by a slight, 4  11.5 mm Hg increase above
baseline during ischemia, and a small reduction of 4  8.6 mm Hg
below baseline after reperfusion initiation in the ischemic groups,
with no age-related statistical difference.
Ischemia induction by 2VO caused a marked drop of CBF in the
young 2VO and old 2VO groups to 41  9.4% and 38  18.2% of
baseline, respectively. In contrast, CBF taken at the end of the
ischemic period persisted at 4322.1% in the young 2VO group, but
decreased further to 18  13.6% in the old 2VO group, being
significantly lower than CBF in the same group earlier at ischemia
onset (p < 0.024), or CBF in the young 2VO group at the end of
ischemia (p<0.028). Finally, CBF peaked during reperfusion at 83
27.6% and 106  62.1% in the young 2VO and old 2VO groups,
respectively, with no statistically significant difference due to age (p
< 0.366). No CBF variation was observed throughout the experimental
period in the control groups.

3.2. The DC potential signature of SD
The approach of SD elicitation (i.e., placing a KCl-soaked cotton
ball on the exposed cortical surface) induced recurrent SDs at
irregular intervals. In the young groups, SD elicitation with the
topical application of 1M KCl was successful in each experiment; by
contrast, 1M concentration of KCl was insufficient to trigger SD in
the old groupsdinstead, 3M KCl or, when still ineffective, a small
KCl crystal was required for SD generation, indicative of a higher
elicitation threshold for SD in the old animals.
SDs were transient (i.e., transient negative shifts in the DC potential
, Fig. 1A), except for 1 animal in the old 2VO group, in which
the first SD appeared to be terminal (i.e., no recovery of the DC
potential, synchronous with a constant isoelectric ECoG signal till
the termination of the experiment). In general, 2e3 SDs were
recorded in the young 2VO and old 2VO groups during ischemia, in
contrast with 4e5 SDs in the respective nonischemic control groups,
showing a tendency for lower SD frequency during ischemia.
Because recurrent SDs occurred at irregular intervals, often in a
rapid succession that disabled the reliable analysis of the CBF responses
associated with subsequent SDs, the first SD alone was
analyzed comprehensively. As Fig. 1A demonstrates, the most
obvious effect of ischemia was the elongated duration of the SD-
related negative DC shift (e.g., 66.2  22.8 vs. 21.4  4.1 seconds,
young 2VO vs. young control; Fig. 1B), which was augmented
further by age as seen in the old 2VO group (95.8  46.2 seconds,
Fig. 1B). The ischemia-related, elongated duration of SDs was also
reflected in the reduced slopes of depolarization (14.511.4 vs. 4.4
 2.9 mV/s, young 2VO vs. young control; Fig. 1 C) and repolarization
(0.7  0.5 vs. 2.6  0.7 mV/s, young 2VO vs. young control;
Fig. 1D). Old age was associated with a reduced slope of depolarization
, as well (1.9  0.9 vs. 2.6  0.7 mV/s, old control vs. young
control; Fig. 1C). Finally, the amplitude of depolarization and
repolarization tended to be smaller in the ischemic groups (Fig. 1E
and F), and older age was associated with a reduced amplitude of
repolarization (2.9  2.9 vs. 5.1  1.2 mV, old control vs. young
control; Fig. 1F).
3.3. Laser-Doppler recording of CBF response to SD
First, screening all experimental groups and all SDs elicited, 6
types of SD-associated CBF response were determined based on the
kinetics of their laser-Doppler trace. As shown in Fig. 2A, the CBF
response types were ranked from the physiological types (type 1
and type 2) toward those consisting of a decreasing hyperemic and
more obvious hypoemic component (types 3e5), ending with
spreading ischemia (type 6). In addition, a few SDs occurred
without a detectable variation in CBF (i.e., no CBF response).
Because the most important parameter in the spectrum from
normal hyperemic responses to inverse responses is the increasing
duration of the initial hypoperfusion (Dreier et al., 2001; Hoffmann
and Ayata, 2013), its duration was quantified (table in Fig. 2A). As
expected, early hypoperfusion was increasingly more represented
with higher rank CBF response types.
Next, the distribution of the defined CBF response types associated
with the first SD was evaluated across experimental groups
(Fig. 2B). The young control group displayed only the physiological
type 1 (n¼4/6) and type 2 (n¼2/6) responses, while thefirst SD in
the young 2VO animals was coupled with types 3e5 response, type
4 being the most frequent of all (n ¼ 5/8). The old control group

developed a wide spectrum of CBF responses ranging between
types 1e4, including an animal with no CBF response, which displayed
an age-related shift to higher rank types as compared with
the young control group. The first SDs in the old 2VO group were
associated with either type 4 (n ¼ 2/6) or type 6 (n ¼ 4/6) CBF
response, showing a striking share of spreading ischemia (i.e., type
6). Quantitative analysis of the duration of early hypoperfusion
(table in Fig. 2B) indicated that this first element of the CBF
response to SD was elongated during ischemia (36.817.5 vs. 7.9
6.8 seconds, young 2VO vs. young control) and became drastically
longer in the old 2VO group (1344  1047 seconds), due to the
prevalence of spreading ischemia.
The quantitative analysis (Fig. 3) relying on the hyperemic type
1e5 CBF responses (i.e., those containing a transient hyperemic
element) revealed that ischemia reduced the amplitude of hyperemia
in both young (5710.1 vs. 156 47.7%, young 2VO vs. young
control) and old animals (3017.9 vs. 18172.7%, old 2VO vs. old
control). At the same time, ischemia extended the duration of hyperemia
significantly (237 97 vs. 3712 seconds, young 2VO vs.
young control; 12275 vs. 4614, old 2VO vs. old control). Taken
together, the hyperemic CBF responses to SDs were of smaller
amplitude but longer duration under ischemia.
Finally, potential association between the duration of the first
SD-related negative DC shift and transient hyperemia was tested as
shown in Fig. 3D, which revealed a very strong correlation (R ¼
0.824) between the two variables.
3.4. Spectral analysis of ECoGs
Taken the trench profile of the integrated power for each ECoG
frequency range, the delta and theta ranges appeared to be dominating
, while the alpha and delta ranges represented a significantly
lower share in the ECoG during baseline and recovery (Fig. 4A).
The rank of SD (i.e.,first or second) had a marked impact on the
level of depression, which was almost twice as high for SD2 than for
SD1, irrespective of ischemia (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the
duration of ECoG depression doubled during ischemic SDs as
compared with the nonischemic time controls for the alpha (152
70 vs. 73  42 seconds), delta (160  88 vs. 87  65 seconds) and
theta (146  82 vs. 78  50 seconds) frequency ranges (Fig. 4D).
Correspondingly, the slope of recovery during ischemic SDs was
only half of the nonischemic time-control events in all frequency
ranges (Fig. 4C). Finally, ADR was substantially higher during
depression as compared with baseline and recovery, with no impact
of SD rank or ischemia (Fig. 4E).
4. Discussion
4.1. Advantages and limitations of the experimental approach
Experimental studies that set ischemic SDs as their target of
investigation predominantly rely on focal ischemia models, in
which recurrent SDs occur spontaneously; yet, the systematic
analysis of spontaneous SDs remains challenging (Bere et al.,
2014b). Even widely accepted ischemia models, such as middle
cerebral artery occlusion are known to produce quite some variation
in ischemia severity (Duverger and MacKenzie, 1988)d probably
because of the anatomic variation in middle cerebral artery
branching patterns (Fox et al., 1993; Rubino and Young, 1988)d
which, in turn, will cause variations in the site of SD elicitation,
direction of SD propagation, SD type (i.e., short transient or prolonged
), and SD pattern (i.e., single events or clusters). A further,
inherent limitation of this approach is that nonischemic time
control cannot be implemented due to the unpredictable occurrence
of spontaneous SDs. For these reasons, we imposed 2VO,
which produces an immediate, reproducible drop in CBF without
the successive occurrence of spontaneous SDs in adult Sprague-
Dawley rats (Bere et al., 2014a), allowing (1) planned, controlled
SD elicitation during ischemia by the topical application of KCl, and
(2) the design of nonischemic time control experiments.
Despite these major advantages of the model, some shortcomings
have emerged during the progression of the study. First, the
elicitation of SDs by continuous exposure of the brain surface to KCl
(Farkas et al., 2011) produced SDs at a rather high frequency, which
hampered the latter analysis of all SDs triggered, leaving the first
1e2 SDs to be evaluated reliably. Second, the unexpected condition
that 1M KCl will not generate SDs in 2-year-old rats, together with
the necessity to produce SDs to assess age-related features of SD
evolution prompted us to use higher concentration KCl for SD induction
in old rats. This led us to conclude that the SD threshold
must be significantly higher in the aged brain (consistent with
previous observation on brain slices) (Maslarova et al., 2011) but did
not allow the precise quantification of SD threshold. We resolved
both of these issues in a subsequent study of ours.

Finally, the study was conducted with the use of 2 distinct
anesthetic agents and mixed strains of rats due to uncontrollable
external conditions. Still, the acquired data are highly consistent
with our previous findings obtained with the use of halothaneanesthetized
Wistar rats (Clark et al., 2014). Furthermore, we
carefully considered any potential impact of the type of anesthesia
on all the read-outs presented, by including the type of anesthesia
as a factor into the statistical analysis. This approach excluded the

the computation of integrated power for the 4 established ECoG frequency bands (i.e., alpha: 8e13 Hz, beta: 13e30 Hz, delta: 0.5e3 Hz, and theta: 3e8 Hz): level of baseline (➀),
slope of depression (➁), level of depression (➂), duration of depression (➃), slope of recovery (➄), and level of recovery (➅). (A) Trench profiles determined by the time dependence
of the spectral powers for each of the 4 frequency ranges are shown. Each line representing a given frequency range was obtained by taking the mean value for SD1 of 3 young
control animals. In the background, an original, representative ECoG trace taken during SD1 of a young control animal is shown in gray. (B) Bar charts demonstrate the level of
depression during SD1 and SD2 for each frequency range of the ECoG. (C) The slope of recovery is displayed for the young control and 2VO groups for each frequency range of the

assessed apart. Each bar in the charts represents mean  standard deviation. A multivariate analysis of variance paradigm followed by a Fisher post hoc test was used for the

possibility that halothane and isoflurane affected MABP, the DC
potential signature of SD or CBF differently. We did find, however,
an anesthesia-related effect on the variables obtained from spectrum
analysis of the ECoG (i.e., isoflurane systematically reduced
the slope and level of recovery after SD, and elevated ADR, as
compared with halothane), therefore only halothane-anesthetized
rats (n ¼ 15) were included in the final quantitative analysis of
the ECoG data.
4.2. The recovery of resting membrane potential after
depolarization is delayed during ischemia and in old age
We have shown here that SD duration at half DC amplitude and
ECoG depression become significantly longer during ischemia,
together with a considerable reduction in the slopes of depolarization
and repolarization and the recovery of activity as seen on the
ECoG. It has been generally accepted that as the same SD propagates
from ischemic to nonischemic cortex, its duration progressively
decreases toward the nonischemic tissue (Nedergaard, 1996; Shin
et al., 2006).
In the present study, the longer duration of SD in the ischemic
brain is attributed to the collective, lower rate of depolarization
and repolarization, rather than the prolongation of complete depolarization
itself (Bere et al., 2014a). During the depolarization
phase of SD, there is an intense efflux of Kþ to the extracellular
space, parallel with considerable influx of Naþ (Hansen and
Zeuthen, 1981; Somjen, 2001). In ischemia, the concentration
gradient between the intracellular and extracellular compartments
becomes lower than in physiological brain tissue (i.e., [Naþ]e, decreases
from 140 to 80 mM, [Kþ]e increases from 5 to 20e60 mM,
with parallel but opposite changes in intracellular ion composition)
(Dugan and Choi, 1999; Rossi et al., 2007). This results in a
considerably reduced (but still substantial) transmembrane ionic
concentration gradient during SD in the ischemic brain tissue
(Somjen, 2001). Therefore, the driving force for Kþ efflux and Naþ
influx that take place during the depolarization phase of SD may
decrease, which is thought to be reflected in the lower rate of
depolarization as measured here.
The optimal function of Naþ/Kþeadenosine triphosphatase
(ATPase) is essential for the restoration of membrane potential
following SD. During ischemia, oxidative substrate supply declines,
and tissue ATP availability decreases, which lead to the reduction of
Naþ/Kþ-ATPase activity (Dreier, 2011), thereby potentially delaying
the restoration of transmembrane potential.
Old-age aggravated the ischemia-related prolongation of SD
duration: 1 of the 6 animals in the old 2VO group displayed
terminal depolarization, and the duration of transient first SDs
was significantly longer as compared with the young 2VO group.
These results stand in agreement with our previous observation
made in a focal forebrain ischemia model that the cortical surface
involved in prolonged SDs was significantly larger in old as
compared with young rats (Clark et al., 2014). These data
together indicate that the aged ischemic brain has scarcer resources
to recover from an SD event, which reflects the increased
vulnerability of the aged brain to ischemia- and/or SD-related
injury.
Finally, the DC potential signature of SDs revealed that the
amplitude of hyperpolarization in old rats was approximately half
of their young counterparts. Hyperpolarization after SD appears to
be a transient overshoot of either [Naþ]e due to the increased activity
of Naþ/Kþ ATPase, or [Cl]e (Hansen and Zeuthen, 1981).
Aging may have an impact on either of these ion fluxes; yet it remains
uncertain which exact mechanism(s) must be responsible for
the age-related reduction in the amplitude of hyperpolarization
seen in our study.
4.3. The hyperemic response to SD diminishes during ischemia and
becomes inverted in the aged ischemic brain
The SD-coupled CBF response in the physiologically intact rat
cortex consists of at least 3 distinct elements: an initial transient
vasoconstriction, a marked hyperemia, and a long-lasting oligemic
phase (Ayata, 2013). Ischemia shifts this balance toward the
domination of the initial vasoconstrictive (hypoemic) element of
the pattern, possibly as a function of decreasing perfusion pressure
(Bere et al., 2014b; Hoffmann and Ayata, 2013). Matching this
concept, we have identified 6 types of CBF kinetics ranging from
dominating hyperemia to prolonged cortical spreading ischemia
with intermediate forms. The types observed during ischemia have,
coincidentally, a perfect match with those described earlier in the
ischemic cortex of stroke patients (Woitzik et al., 2013).
Major observations of the presented research are as follows: (1)
the SD-coupled CBF response types, in which the hypoemic
component is augmented at the expense of the hyperemic
component, occur more frequently in the aged brain, (2) the combination
of ischemia and old age predisposes the cortex for the
evolution of spreading ischemia (inverse neurovascular coupling),
and (3) the ischemia-related perfusion deficit progressively
deepens in the old brain as opposed to the young. During physiological
aging, unfavorable changes occur in the brain’s microcirculation
, including increased vascular wall stiffness (Farkas and
Luiten, 2001), decreased vascular density (Faber et al., 2011),
impaired microvascular reactivity (Park et al., 2007), and weakened
remodeling potential (Faber et al., 2011). The additive outcome is
lower basal CBF, but more importantly, reduced, suboptimal local
CBF elevation in response to neural activity, which is suggested to
contribute to the shift to less obvious hyperemic and more prominent
hypoemic elements in the SD-associated CBF response.
The high incidence of inverse coupling in the old ischemic rats
(also seen in our previous study concerning focal cerebral ischemia,
Clark et al., 2014) is proposed to be determined by the combination
of vasoconstrictive high [Kþ]e and the restricted availability of the
vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) (Windmüller et al., 2005). Ischemia
itself imposes considerable extracellular Kþ accumulation above
the dilation and/or constriction threshold (20 mM) (Hansen and
Zeuthen, 1981), and NO is quickly eliminated by its reaction with
superoxide yielding peroxynitrite (Warner et al., 2004). Limited NO
availability due to increased free radical production causes
dysfunctional NO-based vasodilation during physiological aging, as
well (Mayhan et al., 2008; Ungvari et al., 2010). Ischemia superimposed
on aging, therefore, is thought to potentiate the impairment
of NO-based vasoregulation in the face of high [Kþ]e, which
may lead to a higher incidence of inverse neurovascular coupling in
the aged ischemic brain. In turn, the resultant spreading ischemia is
suggested to deepen the perfusion deficit imposed by ischemia.
4.4. Perfusion deficit during ischemia deepens progressively in the
aged but not in the young brain
CBF sharply drops after ischemia onset, but compensation
through collaterals or vascular remodeling may contribute to slow
partial recovery of perfusion (Clark et al., 2014; Lapi and Colantuoni,
2015). Our data indicate that in the ischemia model used, perfusion
stabilized and persisted at around 40% till the end of the ischemic
period in young rats, but dropped below 20% in old rats, which falls
below the CBF threshold of electrical failure of the nervous tissue
(Astrup et al., 1977). This was also confirmed by the lasting
depression of ECoG during ischemia in our old rats. Although agerelated
cerebrovascular rarefaction may be held responsible for
the poor flow compensation in aged rats (Faber et al., 2011), we
believe that the ischemia-induced perfusion deficit in our study

was aggravated by the high incidence of inverse neurovascular
coupling with SD in old animals. Thus, SDs associated with
spreading ischemia likely impair the recovery of CBF, thereby
worsening ischemia outcome.
4.5. Spectral analysis of ECoGs reveals equal involvement of all
frequency bands and milder depression with recurrent SDs
The spectral analysis of the ECoG revealed at baseline and recovery
that the weight of low frequency bands in the spectrum (i.e.,
delta and theta) is greater than that of higher-frequency waves (i.e.,
alpha and beta) (Fig. 4A). This mainly reflects an inherent feature of
ECoG spectra: because the ECoG frequency bands represent a power
spectrum, their values will vary exponentially, meaning the
lower-frequency bands will have exponentially greater values than
the higher-frequency bands. In addition, halothane anesthesia may
also accentuate the relative weight of low frequencies, because it
decreases the power of higher frequency waves (i.e., alpha and
beta) (Dougherty et al., 1997).
Spectral analysis of the 4 frequency ranges was implemented to
examine whether the SD-related depression of electrical activity
would appear in a distinct form on the various bands of the power
spectrum. During SD, all 4 frequency ranges depressed synchronously
(Fig. 4A), reached the same level of depression for a given SD
(Fig. 4B), and recovered after a period of depression of similar
duration (a bit over a minute in the nonischemic brain,Fig. 4D). The
only significant difference between the 4 waves concerned the
slopes of depression and recovery (being considerably lower for the
alpha and beta waves, Fig. 4C), but this may not have functional
significance since the shallower slope for the higher frequencies
was generated by the smaller power difference between baseline or
recovery and depression (i.e., lower level of baseline or recovery but
the same level of depression). In summary, SD appeared in a similar
fashion on all 4 frequency ranges of the ECoG under halothane
anesthesia.
The observation that the level of depression for the second SD
remained higher as compared with the first SD appears to be
unique. These data suggest that the electrical silence with the
second SD must be incomplete. Although the difference in the kinetics
of the CBF response to thefirst and second SD in a sequence is
well-known (Obrenovitch et al., 2009), according to the best of our
knowledge this is thefirst evidence to demonstrate variation in the
level of depression with recurrent SDs.
Low ADR value has been reported to represent slow ECoG (i.e.,
higher share of low frequencies) and was taken as a predictor of
worse recovery from delayed cerebral ischemia of subarachnoid
hemorrhage patients (Claassen et al., 2004) and pentobarbitalanesthetized
ischemic rats (Liao et al., 2015). Based on these accounts
, together with the widely accepted notion that SD worsens
ischemic brain injury (Back et al., 1996; Dreier, 2011), we set out to
calculate ADR with the expectation to get lower ADR values after
the passage of an SD as an indication for its injurious potential.
During SD, both alpha and delta waves became depressed to a
similar level, which increased the calculated ADR significantly with
respect to baseline. The high ADR in this case should not be interpreted
as a lower ratio of slow waves (Claassen et al., 2004; Liao
et al., 2015), therefore, it can give no predictions as to functional
outcome. During the phase of recovery from SD, ADR returned to
baseline with no difference between ischemic and nonischemic
tissue, therefore, our hypothesis that ADR following SD in the
ischemic tissue would decrease to indicate worse recovery was not
proven. Because the calculations could not be carried out in the old
groups due to excessive noise on the ECoG recordings and
spreading ischemia was detected in these old animals, it remains
possible that ADR following SDs with inverse neurovascular
coupling would indicate dysfunction. This possibility is to be tested
in our subsequent studies.
