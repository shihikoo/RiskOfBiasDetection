ABSTRACT
Background and purpose The rabbit small clot
embolic model for large vessel occlusion (LVO) is well
established, yet has limitations. Blind introduction of
autologous thrombus often fails to completely occlude a
target vessel and, when successful, the precise timing of
occlusion and revascularization is difficult to control.
Studies of cellular biology and neuroimaging of acute
reversible cerebral ischemia (ie, penumbral tissue) would
benefit from a rabbit model in which LVO can be reliably
induced, easily confirmed, and in which the time of
occlusion and revascularization can be precisely
controlled.
Methods Transfemoral 1.5 F microcatheterization of
the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was performed in
anesthetized rabbits (n=7) using fluoroscopic guidance.
LVO with the wedged microcatheter was maintained for
30–210 min followed by reperfusion. Diffusion-weighted
and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI
was performed 3 h after catheter removal on a 3 T
scanner. Post-mortem histopathologic analysis of brain
tissue was performed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC).
Results Placing of the 1.5 F microcatheter tip in the
PCA was successful in all seven animals. Infarct size on
matched diffusion-weighted and TTC sections was
strongly correlated (r2=0.86). Transient PCA occlusion of
30–60 min resulted in infarction of the ipsilateral
hippocampus and thalamus, sparing the cortex, while
more prolonged occlusion (180–210 min) resulted in
cortical infarction as well.
Conclusions Image-guided microcatheter induction of
PCA occlusion in rabbits can consistently produce timedependent
infarction of cortical and subcortical
structures that is reliably detected by diffusion-weighted
MRI, and thus may be a useful model for therapeutic
studies in acute ischemic stroke.
INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability
in the USA.1 Despite tremendous progress in
understanding the pathophysiology of stroke, there
has been slow translation of this understanding to
the clinic. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
remains the only FDA-approved pharmacologic
therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
While animal models exist for studying AIS, successful
animal trials have not resulted in the
approval of any new pharmacologic therapy since
the approval of tPA in 1995. The rabbit small clot
embolic stroke model (RSCEM), first described by
Zivin et al in 1985,2 remains the only preclinical
model that eventually led to FDA approval as a
stroke therapeutic. The apparent discrepancy
between experimental models and clinical efficacy
has left the field in search of a more suitable animal
model to study AIS.3
In this preliminary study, we propose to develop
an image-guided endovascular catheter approach to
study AIS that aims to resolve many of the lingering
issues currently facing RSCEM. First and foremost,
a guided catheter approach allows for precision in
the location and timing of the occlusion. Currently,
most AIS animal models focus on the anterior circulation
via occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). This has left the posterior circulation,
which is involved in up to 20% of ischemic strokes,
relatively understudied as animal models are fewer
and may be less reproducible than those studying
the anterior circulation.4 5 Additionally, fluoroscopic
image guidance has the advantage of demonstrating
that vessel occlusion and recanalization
have been accomplished using boluses of
intra-arterial contrast media, which enables reliable
timing of experimental ischemia.
METHODS
Surgical procedures
This study was performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approval from IACUC. The studies were conducted
on New Zealand white rabbits (4–5 kg)
(Western Oregon). The animals were pretreated
with subcutaneous buprenorphine 30 min prior to
ketamine-xylazine for induction of anesthesia and
postoperative analgesia, followed by isoflurane
(2%) for maintenance. Continuous physiologic
monitoring was performed throughout the procedure
including blood pressure, temperature, heart
rate, and pulse oximetry. Normotension and
euthermia were maintained throughout the procedure
and in the post-procedure period. The femoral
area was shaved of hair and then prepped with
povidone-iodine solution and incisional bupivacaine.
Transfemoral microcatheterization (1.5 F
Spinnaker; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont,
California, USA) of the posterior cerebral artery
(PCA) was performed using fluoroscopic roadmapped
guidance. Iodinated contrast media
(Omnipaque 350) was used for X-ray fluoroscopic
imaging of the cerebral vessels. No anticoagulants

or vasospasm-relieving agents were used in the experimental
animals. Large vessel occlusion (LVO), achieved by wedging the
tip of the microcatheter in the PCA origin, was maintained for
30 min (n=2), 60 min (n=2), 180 min (n=2) and 210 min
(n=1), followed by microcatheter removal and reperfusion. The
rabbits remained under anesthesia and MRI was performed 3 h
after reperfusion.
MRI
Evaluation of the infarct volume was accomplished using a 3 T
clinical MR scanner (GE, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). MRI
was performed 3–4 h after reperfusion. The following sequences
were used in the current study:
1. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI): TR=200 ms, TE=70 ms,
slice thickness=3 mm, b value=1000 and 2500, FOV
12×12 mm, matrix size=128×128 and 2 NEX=1, and total
scan time ∼4 min. The diffusion-weighted images were transferred
to a workstation where diffusion coefficients were
derived.
2. T2fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR): TR=11 000 ms,
TE=125 ms, TI=2800slice thickness=3 mm, b value=1000,
FOV-160×160 mm, matrix size=512×512 and 2 NEX=1, and
total scan time∼8min.
Postmortem histopathology
At the conclusion of imaging, anesthetized animals were killed
by intravenous injection of saturated potassium chloride (1 ml/
kg). Freshly excised brains were sliced (∼2 mm slice thickness),
weighed, and stained in 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37°C for 30–40 min to visualize the damaged tissue.
Digital images of TTC-stained slices were acquired, converted
to black and white using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe
Systems, USA), and used for measurement of damaged tissue.
MRIs were registered with TTC slices.
Image and statistical analysis
Comparison was made between matching diffusion-weighted
images and TTC-stained brain sections from the same rabbit
(n=7 rabbits). TTC section faces were paired with the best corresponding
diffusion-weighted image from the same rabbit
(n=44 paired sections). Based on the infarct size and location,
three animals each had two consecutive sections and four
animals had three consecutive sections for a total of 18 unique
tissue slices with imaging correlation. Regional signal intensity
of areas of reduced diffusion and remote brain tissue on DWI
and unstained areas on TTC remote brain tissue were determined.
The infarction size on both DWI and TTC slices was
determined using the semi-automatic threshold method,
ImageJ.6 The regions with signal intensity >3SD above the
remote brain were considered infarcted and presented as a percentage
of slice surface area. This semi-automatic threshold
method has been previously established in infarct studies.7
Linear regression analysis was performed comparing DWI
infarct and TTC infarct.
RESULTS
Placing of the 1.5 F microcatheter tip in the PCA was successful
in all seven animals. Figure 1 shows representative fluoroscopic
images of the microcatheter in the right PCA, which was
achieved via the left cervical vertebral and basilar arteries.
Unlike T2-FLAIR MRI, DW-MRI demonstrated the progressive
increase in infarction size as a function of PCA occlusion time.
Infarcted brain tissue was observed on DW-MRI images as a
high signal lesion compared with remote tissue (figure 2). There
was a substantial difference in the diffusion coefficient between

infarcted brain tissue (590 s/mm2) and remote normal tissue
(780 s/mm2).
Furthermore, transient (30–60 min) PCA occlusion resulted
in infarction of the ipsilateral hippocampus and thalamus,
sparing the cortex, while more prolonged occlusion (180–
210 min) resulted in cortical infarction as well. Brain stem
infarction was not observed on any of the DWI scans, suggesting
that the catheter passed though the basilar artery with little to
no damage or occlusion. TTC stained normal brain tissue red,
but not infarcted tissue, and was able to confirm the presence of
infarcted tissue seen on DW-MRI (figures 2 and 3). The percentage
infarct of matched DWI and TTC sections was strongly
correlated (r2=0.85, figure 3).
DISCUSSION
An image-guided microcatheter method was developed that can
consistently induce LVO (PCA) in rabbits. The method can reliably
produce time-dependent infarction of cortical and subcortical
structures, which was confirmed on gold standard
histopathology. The extent of infarction appears to be well captured
on DW-MRI, given its strong correlation with infarct
defined on histochemical TTC stain.
Although a previous microcather model has been described
by Jahan et al,8 the novel use of microcatheter wedged vascular
occlusion allows for direct visualization of successful LVO and
the ability to precisely control the location and duration of
occlusion as well as the timing of reperfusion. DW-MRI on a
3 T clinical MR scanner can be used to reliably quantify infarction
volume, but not T2-FLAIR MRI. There remains wide interest
in the use of rabbit models for translational stroke research,
and recent work continues to characterize the RSCEM
model.9 10 However, studies of cellular biology and neuroimaging
of acute reversible and irreversible cerebral ischemia would
benefit from a rabbit model in which LVO can be induced reproducibly
, easily confirmed, and in which the time of occlusion
and revascularization can be precisely controlled. The presented
model warrants additional study to better evaluate its utility.
In conclusion, image-guided microcatheter induction of PCA
occlusion in rabbits can reliably produce time-dependent infarction
of cortical and subcortical structures that is reliably
detected by DW-MRI and thus may be a useful model for therapeutic
studies in AIS. This model has the potential to be useful
for the study of penumbral cortical tissue and the effects of new
therapies.
