Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has been used by several groups to assess cerebral hemodynamics of cerebral
ischemia in humans and animals. In this study, we combined DOT with an indocyanine green (ICG)-tracking
method to achieve interleaved images of cerebral hemodynamics and bloodflow index (BFI) using two middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat models. To achieve volumetric images with high-spatial resolution, we
first integrated a depth compensation algorithm (DCA) with a volumetric mesh-based rat head model to generate
three-dimensional (3D) DOT on a rat brain atlas. Then, the experimental DOT data from two rat models were
collected using interleaved strategy for cerebral hemodynamics and BFI during and after ischemic stroke, with
and without a thrombolytic therapy for the embolic MCAO model. The acquired animal data were further analyzed
using theintegrated rat-atlas-guided DOT method to form time-evolving 3D imagesof both cerebral hemodynamics
and BFI. In particular, we were able to show and identify therapeutic outcomes of a thrombolytic
treatment applied to the embolism-induced ischemic model. This paper demonstrates that volumetric DOT is
capable of providing high-quality, interleaved images of cerebral hemodynamics and blood perfusion in small
animals during and after ischemic stroke, with excellent 3D visualization and quantifications.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke and animal models
Stroke is an emergency cerebrovascular condition and is the major
leading cause of death in the United States with more than 130,000
deaths and disabilities annually (Kochanek et al., 2011). Stroke occurs
when 1) blood flow to the brain is obstructed (ischemic stroke), or 2)
blood vessels break and blood bleeds into brain tissues (hemorrhagic
stroke).Ofall patients diagnosed with stroke, more than 80% experience
an ischemic stroke. Animal models are often used to help researchers
better understand the pathogenesis of ischemia, to define biochemical
changes in brain tissues during and after ischemia, and to discover
mechanisms involved in the evolution of ischemic injury to the brain,
as well as to examine therapeutic outcomes of new drugs and treatments.
Among animal models, rat ischemic models have been well
developed and widely utilized because the anatomy of arterial supplies
to cerebral hemispheres in rats is essentially similar to that in
humans. In particular, middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke
models are well established in rats mostly through occlusion of MCA
using either the craniotomic or endovascular approach because ischemic
stroke is often caused by occlusion of MCA and/or its branches
in humans.
Non-invasive optical techniques to measure cerebral hemodynamics
Several types of non-invasive imaging techniques, such as computed
tomography (CT) (von Kummer et al., 1997) and magnetic resonance

imaging (MRI), especially diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI
(Neumann-Haefelin et al., 1999), have been used to investigate
stroke and its possible treatments in experimental studies. For the
last decade, researchers have been investigating non-invasive detection
of cerebral hemodynamics using near infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) due to its portability, non-radiation, cost-effectiveness, and
high temporal resolution. Since light in the near-infrared (NIR)
range (600–900 nm) can penetrate a few centimeters into brain tissues
, it can probe changes in oxygenated (HbO
2
) and deoxygenated
(HbR) hemoglobin concentrations in the cerebral regions. Total hemoglobin
concentrations can be quantified by HbT = HbO
2
+HbR,
serving as another hemodynamic contrast in proportion to the
cerebral blood volume.
Specifically, with single or limited source–detector pairs, several
NIRS measurements were performed in investigating cerebral hemodynamics
during cerebral ischemia (Liu et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2007)using
a suture-induced rat MCA occlusion (MCAO) model. With multiple
source–detector pairs and a similar rat MCAO model, researchers
(Chen et al., 2000, 2002) showed two dimensional (2D) topographic
maps of HbT after performing spatial interpolation among the multichannel
NIRS readings. Their results exhibited good correlations with
MR imagesand histological brain slices oftheanimals. Moreover, diffuse
optical tomography (DOT), which utilizes diffusion theory to reconstruct
tomographic images of multi-channel NIRS with a relatively
large number of source–detector pairs, has demonstrated the feasibility
of three dimensional (3D) image reconstruction of cerebral hemodynamics
during cerebral ischemia in rat MCAO (Culver et al., 2003a)or
common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion models (Bluestone et al.,
2004b).
Non-invasive techniques to measure cerebral bloodflow
Assessment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is also important and
useful for understanding and interpreting hemodynamic kinetics
and cerebral physiology of acute ischemic stroke, especially for
embolism-induced ischemia. Continuous observation of regional
CBF (rCBF) for patients receiving thrombolytic treatment is crucial
because ischemic tissues may be non-functional or dying due to different
levels of blood reperfusion, which may cause a severe neurological
and fatal deficit in the brain. Studies have shown that infarct
volume highly depends on reduction of CBF during cerebral ischemia
and perfusion recovery from ischemia (Soriano et al., 1997).
There are several techniques providing rCBF measurements, including
single photon emission tomography (SPECT) (Kwiatek et al.,
2000; Pavics et al., 1999), CT, positron emission tomography (PET)
(Johnson et al., 1999; Tuominen et al., 2004), perfusion-weighted
MRI, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) (Shang et al., 2011;
Zhou et al., 2006), and laser Doppler flowmetry (Liu et al., 2008;
Tonnesen et al., 2005). All of these techniques have been adopted
in human and animal studies.
Furthermore, measurements of rCBF by tracking the kinetics of
an intravenous tracer or contrast, namely, indocyanine green
(ICG), with NIRS have been reported when evaluating reduction of
rCBF for patients with acute ischemic stroke (Terborg et al., 2004).
The ICG-tracking technique allows repetitive and minimally invasive
(due to the injection of ICG solution) measurements in a very
short period of time because of rapid clearance of ICG from the
blood stream. Researchers have shown that a blood flow index
(BFI) derived from ICG kinetics is significantly correlated with the
cortical blood flow (Kuebler et al., 1998), and thus allows rCBF assessment
with good reproducibility (Keller et al., 2003; Wagner
et al., 2003). Using the NIRS topographic technique, researchers
have also shown the feasibility of generating 2D CBF images of infant
patients with infarcts and hemorrhages; those images had good correlation
with SPECT images (Kusaka et al., 2001).
Motivation and organization of this paper
The aim of this study was to investigate changes in cerebral hemodynamics
and CBF kinetics during and after ischemic stroke,
with and without thrombolytic therapy for an embolic MCAO
model, using three-dimensional diffuse optical tomography (3D
DOT). We have achieved interleaved 3D imaging of hemispheric hemodynamic
changes and CBF kinetics after integrating conventional
DOT with our recently developed depth compensation algorithm
(DCA). The novelty of this paper includes 1) design and implementation
of an interleaved method to quantify two sets of changes in
both hemoglobin concentrations and BFI during and after MCAO in
rat, 2) integration of DCA with a volumetric mesh-based rat head
model to generate volumetric DOT on a rat brain atlas, and 3) longitudinal
imaging and quantification of cerebral hemodynamics and
CBF index before, during, and after a thrombolytic therapy for an
embolic MCAO model.
This paper will provide details on several aspects of the study in
the following order: First, we will modify and combine our recently
developed DCA with a volumetric mesh-based rat head model to
generate volumetric DOT on a rat brain atlas/template for improved
depth localization and better visualization of MCAO effects in the rat
brain. Second, we will describe how a suture-induced MCAO rat
model was achieved and measured by a high-density DOT system
one hour during and one hour after MCAO. The suture-induced
MCAO model is studied mainly for validation of our experimental
setup, measurement methodology, and volumetric image reconstruction
as this model has been well established and documented.
Third, we will introduce how our newly established embolisminduced
MCAO rat model was utilized and measured with the same
experimental setup and procedures. Next, interleaved data collection
, analysis and volumetric image reconstruction will be described
for longitudinal monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics and CBF
index during and after MCA embolization. We will also discuss the
effect of thrombolytic treatment. This work will demonstrate the
feasibility of interleaved volumetric DOT to monitor longitudinal
progress of cerebral hemodynamics and blood perfusion during
and after cerebral ischemia in rats with and without therapeutic
treatments. Results will be illustrated through high-quality 3D visualization
and quantifications.
We will also discussthe influence of ICG injectionson thequantification
of hemodynamic variables and effect of thrombolytic treatment.
This work will demonstrate the feasibility and limitation of interleaved
volumetric DOT to monitor longitudinal progress of cerebral hemodynamics
and blood perfusion during and after cerebral ischemia in rats
with and without therapeutic treatments.
Materials and methods
Animal preparation
Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 350–400 g were purchased
from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and housed in a 12 h light and
12 h dark cycle with free access to water and food. All surgical procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Texas at Arlington and the University of North
Texas Health Science Center.
In this study, we created and measured two types of ischemic stroke
rat models: suture-induced (Longa et al., 1989; Xia et al., 2007)and
embolism-induced MCAO model (Ren et al., 2012), respectively. We
briefly describe the procedures here.
1. Suture-induced ischemic model: The rat was anesthetized with
isoflurane (2–2.5%); the left MCA was occluded by monofilament
silicon-coated suture introduced throughout the left internal carotid
artery (ICA), as shown in Xia et al. (2007). The time period for
567 Z.-J. Lin et al. / NeuroImage 85 (2014) 566–582
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.445825815)
occlusion was 60 min. Approximately 60 min after occlusion, the suture
was smoothly withdrawn for reperfusion.
2. Embolism-induced ischemic model (Fig. 1A): Blood clots mixed with
thrombin, fibrinogen, and fresh blood withdrawn from a donor rat
were made 24 h before the stroke induction (Ren et al., 2012). For
surgery of embolic MCAO, the rat was anesthetized with isoflurane
(2–2.5%); the left external carotid artery (ECA) was exposed through
a midlinecervicalskin incision.Blood clotswere then introduced into
the lumen of ECA via the PE-50 tubing (inner diameter = 0.58 mm;
outer diameter = 0.99 mm) with the tip of the catheter close to the
CCA bifurcation for delivering clots toward the brain. One hour after
embolization, the rat received thrombolysis, in which recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), a thrombolytic treatment, was
intravenously injected into the jugular vein at a dose of 5 mg/kg
body weight with a 10% bolus and 90% continuous infusion for
30 min (Ren et al., 2012).
Instrumentation and experimental setup for animal study
DOT measurements on a rat head were performed non-invasively
with a tomographic imaging system, namely, a dynamic near-infrared
optical tomographic instrument, DYNOT (NIRx Medical Technologies,
LLC, NY, USA). Laser lights from each of two laser diodes, with wave
lengths of 760 nmand 830 nm,were sequentially coupled into different
fiber bundles and delivered to various positions on the rat head. Specifically
, a fiber array consisted of 20 bifurcated source–detector probes
(4 rows × 5 columns) that were placed symmetrically on the rat's
scalp above the region of cerebrum with a nearest inter-optode distance
of 5 mm, as shown in Fig. 1B. The full tomographic dataset, involving
20 sources and 20 detectors, contained a total of 380 source–detector
pairs/measurements (i.e., 20 × 19, ignoring the collocationfibers). The
system operated in a continuous-wave mode with a frame rate of
1.81 Hz.
The rat hair was trimmed to ensure betterfiber-skin contact. During
the measurement, the animal was fixed in a rigid platform and kept in
the supine position (Fig. 1C). The reason for having the rats in a supine
position was that it allowed access to midline cervical structure for
MCAO surgery without perturbing the DOT measurement, and it allowed
investigators to keep the locations of optodes unchanged throughout the
entire period of the experiment. During the measurements, the rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane (2–2.5%) in 80% air and 20% O
2
.Bodytemperature
was monitored by a rectal probe and was maintained by a
heating pad between 36.5 °C and 37 °C. Physiological parameters including
heart rate, breath rate, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured
and monitored by a pulse oximeter (MouseOx, STARR Life Sciences Corp.,
MN, USA). Multi-channel NIRS data recorded by DYNOT were preprocessed
for each source–detector pair measurement. A band-pass filter
, with corner frequencies between 0.01 and 0.3 Hz, was applied to remove
the high-frequency instrument noise and low-frequency baseline
drift.
Experimental design to study ischemic stroke in rats
Based on how the ischemic stroke was generated, our experimental
protocols were divided into two major groups: G-I was for the sutureinduced
ischemic model and G-II for embolism-induced ischemic model.
For both models, an ICG-tracking method was also utilized to study
reduction of CBF due to focal cerebral ischemia. ICG powder (Sigma-
Aldrich Co. LLC, St. Louis, Mo) was dissolved and diluted with saline,
having a dosage of 1 mg/kg, approximately 0.4 mg per rat. ICG solution
was further separated into eight small volumes for multiple injections
through the femoral vein at eight different time points during the entire
experiment (seeFig. 2). For ICG injection, a catheter was replaced or imbedded
(Fig. 1D) into the rat's cervical skin incision to minimize the
leakage of ICG solution.
To determine the inter-injection period for ICG, we performed
ICG kinetics measurements on normal rats (n = 3). For each rat,
the ICG solution with an appropriate concentration was injected
three times every 30 min. We observed that the recovery time between
the injection onset and the time when the optical signals
returned to the pre-injection level was 2.2 ± 0.6 min. Based on
this result, the inter-injection period was selected to be 10 min,
which allows enough time for ICG to be cleared from the animal's
blood stream.
It is also noteworthy that the NIRS measurements of absorption
would be interfered by ICG injections. In order to study the effect of
ICG injections on the measured changes of hemodynamic signals
during cerebral ischemia, we compared the hemodynamic measurements
between two sub-groups that were with and without
ICG injection. This comparison was carried out using only sutureinduced
ischemic rat models. The two sub-groups are described
as follows.
1. G-I
no-ICG
(n = 9): In rats selected for MCAO surgery, the left MCA
was occluded by silicon-coated suture for 60 min. followed by reperfusion
after smoothly withdrawing the suture. The NIRS measurements
were not perturbed by ICG injection.
2. G-I
ICG
(n = 6): Rats selected for this procedure underwent MCAO
surgery with the same procedures as that used in G-I
no-ICG
. ICG solution
was injected at the following time points: 30, 40, and 50 min
after the suture was introduced, 10 min after withdrawal of the suture
, and every 10 min thereafter for 1 h.
Furthermore, 12 rats were used for the embolism-induced ischemia
study. Six rats were treated with rtPA, while the other six rats were used
as a control group, receiving a saline injection instead. These two subgroups
are described as follows.

(permanent cerebral ischemia, control group; n = 6):
Rats underwent MCAO surgery; the left MCA was occluded by embolic
clots for 60 min. Saline was administrated for 30 min after
one hour occlusion. ICG solution was also injected at 30, 40, and
50 min after embolization, 10 min after saline administration, and
every 10 min thereafter for 1 h.

Rats were similarly prepared as G-II
ICG_no-rtPA

ICG_no-rtPA
for
appropriate comparison.

depicted or outlined inFig. 2.
Rat head model and forward light modeling
In order to accurately model light propagation in a realistic rat brain,
high-quality co-registration of the optical optodes on a rat brain atlas or
template was essential. Based on a 3D rat head atlas (Fig. 3A) generated
by T2-weighted MRI (Valdes-Hernandez et al., 2011), we identified the
boundaries of three main regions of interest (ROI), namely, the skin/
muscle, skull, and brain, respectively, and further segmented them

using multi-level Otsu's thresholding technique (Liao et al., 2001). Each of
the segmented 2D images was stacked in sequence together to form a 3D
volume model as shown inFigs. 3BtoD.Volumetricfinite element model
(FEM)meshes( Fig. 3E) were then generated by using a MATLAB-based
mesh generator, iso2mesh (http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/
index.cgi). This FEM of a rat head contained 16,118 nodes, corresponding
to 96,389 linear tetrahedral elements. Each node was belonged to and
thus labeled by one of the three ROIs; the node locations were assigned
specific tissue optical properties (Bluestone et al., 2004a). Accordingly,
the absorption coefficients were 0.02 mm−1 for the rat skin/muscle,
0.005 mm−1for the rat skull, and 0.015 mm−1for the rat brain. The corresponding
reduced scattering coefficients were 0.68 mm−1 for the rat
skin/muscle, 2.2 mm−1for the rat skull, and 2.2 mm−1for the rat brain
(Bluestone et al., 2004a).
Next, we needed to achieve a geometric transformation of the rat
head coordinates so that the optode locations measured in the realworld
coordinates could be read and projected on the MRI coordinates.
To do so, we selected four landmarks on the rat head (i.e., the outlet
points of the external auditory meatus and the centers of two eyeballs,
as marked by four arrows inFig. 1B) as references to compute the transformation
matrix, W.Speci fically, the optode locations in a real-world
(RW) coordinates system were measured by a 3D Patriot™ digitizer
(Polhemus Inc., Colchester, VT) (Cazzell et al., 2012). Using the coordinates
of the rat's eyes and ears as reference points, the affine transformation

Eqs. (1) and (2), the optode locations matrix measured by the digitizer

, the optode coordinates in Z axis were quite close to the surface
of the animal head model, but not exactly located on the surface in
most cases. In order to ensure projection of the optodes on the
animal's head surface, the norms of closest surface patches were calculated
and optodes were then projected along the averaged norm of
those patches (Fig. 3F).
Next, forward calculation to model light propagation in the rat
head was performed using a FEM-based MATLAB package, NIRFAST
(Dehghani et al., 2008), to obtain the Jacobian matrix (also called the
sensitivity matrix) J, which represents changes of measured signals on
the boundary due to a small absorption perturbation within the
interrogated volume by the corresponding optode pair. Using the
Rytov approximation (Arridge, 1999), the forward problem for light

To implement DCA in the FEM-based rat brain atlas geometry, we
needed to determineLto be compatible with the rat brain atlas. Numerically

use the minimum of all these distances to define the distance between

Calculation of ICG kinetics and data analysis
The two wavelengths (760 nm and 830 nm) used in the DOT measurements
were all close to the maximal absorption spectral peak of
ICG; thus, we selected the optical signals measured at 760 nm for
reconstructing images associated with ICG concentrations. From each
temporal or longitudinal measurement set per animal, a time series of
volumetric reconstructed images proportional to the ICGconcentrations
were obtained. ICG kinetics was then achieved by extracting the signals
from each voxel alongthetimeaxis. Specifically,theoptical signals were
first corrected or calibrated to the 5-s pre-injection baseline level and
then de-trended to remove any signal drift due to either the instrument
drift or slow hemodynamic drift in the rats during and/or after MCAO.
To quantify the ICG kinetics, several parameters were defined and determined
as follows (Kuebler et al., 1998).
1. Maximum changes of ICG concentration (∆ICG): For most of NIRS
measurements, HbO
2
and HbR are two major chromophores, which
contribute to changes in optical signals. In this study, nevertheless,
ICG was also utilized to study CBF or its index during and after
MCAO. Note that we could not obtain the absolute concentration
changes of ICG due to the limitation of used wavelengths for measurement.
However, we observed significantly large changes or increases
in optical density (more than 10-fold) right after ICG
injectionin theanimals ascompared tothefluctuationsof optical signals
caused by changes of HbO
2
and HbR concentration. Hence,
changes of optical density (∆OD
ICG
) were de fined as∆ICG in this
study (seeFig. 4).
2. Rise time (RT): RT is defined as the time interval when∆OD
ICG
increased
from 10% to 90% of maximum∆ICG,∆ICG
max
; this definition
could avoid the exact temporal selection of start point of ICG bolus.
3. Bloodflow index (BFI):BFIshould be defined as:
BFI ¼
ΔICG
RT
: ð9Þ
As described in Image reconstruction and depth compensation
algorithm section, changes in light absorption (due to either ischemia
or ICG administration) can be reconstructed at each voxel or
node in the rat head model. This allows one to reconstruct tomographic
images of ∆OD
ICG
at different time points when ICG is
injected. Accordingly, volumetric ICG kinetic images are generated
by calculating the corresponding values of∆ICG, RT,andBFI, at each
voxel or mesh node.
4. In general,BFIis directly proportional to CBF. However, several studies
have also reported that BFI can provide accurate, repeatable results
only for intra-subject comparisons, but not for inter-subject
comparisons because of the unknown proportionality or normalization
factor amongdifferentanimals (Wagner et al., 2003). Thus,averaging
individual BFI values across subjects or animals need
validation. In order to remove subject-dependent variation, we
introduced a BFI ratio, Ratio
BFI
, which computes the ratio between
two spatially-averaged BFI values within ROI-2 and ROI-1 for each
individual rat. Mathematically, RatioBFI ¼
BFI
s averaged ROI−2
BFIs averaged ROI−1
, where 
BFI
s _ averaged _ ROI− 1
and BFI
s _ averaged _ ROI− 2
are spatially averaged
over each voxel or node within entire regions of ROI-1 and ROI-2, respectively
, for each animal. We then averaged theBFIratios across all
rats and calculated a group mean of Ratio
BFI
for each time point (see
Inline Supplementary Fig. S1).

Interleaved data acquisition and volumetric images for hemodynamics and
BFI
While the data collection in our animal experiments by the
multi-channel DYNOT system was temporally continuous before,
during, and after MCAO, two different types of optical density
changes (ΔOD), which reflected two types of physiological signals
, were acquired in an interleaved format. In general, ΔOD
values at a selected wavelength in our rat MCAO measurement
should be equal to ΔOD
total
=ΔOD
ICG
+ΔOD
no-ICG
, where ΔOD
ICG
andΔOD
no-ICG
representΔODvalues with and without ICG administration
in the animal. As mentioned in Experimental design to study
ischemic stroke in rats and Calculation of ICG kinetics and data analysis
sections, the clearance time of ICG in the animal was about 2.2 ±
0.6 min, while an increase in ΔOD by ICG could be 10-fold or bigger
right after ICG injection in the animals. Therefore, we designed an interleaved
approach to obtain two phases of data selection/acquisition: One
was to grasp theΔOD values within 3–4 min right after ICG injection so
thatΔOD
total
≈ ΔOD
ICG
; the other was to pick up the optical signals
five minutes after ICG administration so that ΔOD
total
≈ ΔOD
no-ICG
since most of ICG was cleared from the rat blood stream by then.
The former phase measurement during ΔOD
total
≈ ΔOD
ICG
allowed
us to determineBFIreadings as described inCalculation of ICG kinetics
and data analysis section, while the latter phase measurement
during ΔOD
total
≈ ΔOD
no-ICG
resulted in quantification of HbO
2
,
HbR, and HbT.
Specifically, the interleaved protocol is shown inFig. 2.Forhemodynamic
signal (HbO

, HbR, HbT) analysis in all four animal groups
(i.e., G-I
no-ICG
, G-I 
ICG
, G-II
ICG_no_rtPA
, and G-II 
ICG_rtPA
), we selected
the data at specific time windows: 15 min after suture was introduced,
followed by every 10 min thereafter until either the suture was withdrawn
or rtPA/saline was administered. Note that for G-II (i.e.,
embolism-induced MCAO) an extra period of 30 min was added one
hour after MCAO to infuse the rtPA/saline solution for 30-min thrombolytic
/sham treatment (seeFig. 2). On the other hand, forBFIdata acquisition
in three groups (i.e., G-I
ICG
, G-II
ICG_no_rtPA
,andG-II
ICG_rtPA
), ICG
solution was injected 30, 40, and 50 min after the MCAO was introduced
, 10 min after suture withdrawal or rtPA/saline infusion, and
every 10 min thereafter for 1 h (see Experimental design to study
ischemic stroke in rats section and Fig. 2). Note that a time interval of
5 min was given between the ICG injection onset and data grasp for hemodynamic
signals in order tominimizethe crosstalk betweenchanges
in hemoglobin concentrations and the early phase of ICG clearance.
Statistical consideration
All data were expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation). The
significance of differences between group means was determined
using Student's paired t-test. The relationship of hemodynamic changes
between G-I
no-ICG
and G-I
ICG
for each HbO
2
,HbR,andHbTatthesame
time points throughout the entire experiment (before, during, and
after MCAO) was examined by Pearson product–moment correlation.
Any pvalue less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Volumetric DOT measurement sensitivity (MS) shown on a rat brain atlas
Considering the volumetric distributions of DOT sensitivities, we
compared the depth-compensated and depth-uncompensated measurement
sensitivities (MS), namely, J
rh
# versus J
rh
, within cortical
(shown by yellow isosurface in Fig. 5A) and subcortical (shown by
gray isosurface in Fig. 5A) areas. Moreover, since the distributions of
MS depend highly on the arrangement of optodes, we chose three coronal
cross sections to see volumetric sensitivity distributions, asmarked
by three dashed lines inFig. 5B: ~2 mm above the bottom row (crosssection
I), central line (cross-section II), and ~2 mm below the top
row (cross-section III) of the optode array, respectively. Figs. 5CandD
depict the corresponding coronal views of spatial distributions of uncompensated
and compensated MS. Both sets of these figures reveal
that the cortical and upper subcortical areas/volumes (red colored)
have a MS higher than MS
high
(MS
high

max
,whereS
max
is the
maximum sensitivity). Without using DCA,Fig. 5Cshowsthatapproximately
one-third of the cross-sectional cerebral area has a MS lower
than MS
low
(MS

=10%S

), mainly located at the bottom of the
subcortical area. After utilizing DCA, Fig. 5D illustrates that almost all
the cortical and subcortical areas/volumes have a MS above MS
medium
(MS

),demonstrating improved MS indepth for imaging
deeper tissues.
Rat brain atlas-guided DOT images of cerebral hemodynamics in ischemic
rats
Using the procedures given in Rat head model and forward light
modeling and Image reconstruction and depth compensation algorithm
sections,wewereabletoobtainvolumetricDOTimagesreconstructed
on a rat brain atlas for studying cerebral hemodynamics in ischemic
stroke rats. Fig. 6A demonstrates reconstructed images from G-I
no-ICG
rats during MCAO. The upper row of Fig. 6Ashowstheisosurfaceplots
or 3D rendered rat brains with changes in oxygenated (ΔHbO

), deoxygenated
(ΔHbR), and total hemoglobin (ΔHbT) concentrations, averaged

reconstructed tomographic images of ΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR and ΔHbT sliced
along a coronal view, as marked by the thick line across the center of
the probe array in Fig. 6B. The areas shown correspond to the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The isosurface plots inFig. 6A reveal decreases
ofΔHbO
2
andΔHbT and increases inΔHbR during MCAO. These
plots also demonstrate that major hemodynamic changes occurred on
the outer side of the left hemispheres, which matched well near the
MCA territory. The volumetric DOT results were confirmed by histological
analysis [2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining] of this
suture-induced stroke rat model as shown in Fig. 6C. Furthermore, the
coronal views of these images exhibit that major hemodynamic changes
took place on the left (or ipsi-lateral) side of cortical as well as subcortical
regions. Our observation is consistent with a review report (Carmichael,
2005), which documented that most of the animal stroke models produce
substantial damages to many different brain regions, including
those seen in Fig. 6.

Changes of cerebral hemodynamics in suture-induced ischemic stroke
model
To further investigate the hemodynamic changes during MCAO and
reperfusion, we compared the reconstructed DOT images between the
ischemic and non-ischemic side of the rat brain. Two regions of interest
(ROIs) within the reconstructed images were chosen and located on the
outer right side (ROI-1, contralateral control region) and outer left side
(ROI-2, ipsilateral ischemic region) of the rat brain, as shown in Fig. 7
with correct dimensions and locations marked.
Temporal and spatial analysis
For temporal data analysis, all the FEM-based mesh nodes located
within the two ROIs were extracted; the corresponding reconstructed
parameters (e.g.,ΔHbO andΔHbR) were spatially summed and averaged
at each time point for each rat followed by a grand average over nine rats.
Quantitative time traces of hemodynamic changes from these ROIs at different
time periods are plotted in the top panel ofFig. 8.FromFig. 8A, we
observed a significant decrease inΔHbO
2
in ROI-2 while the suture was
introduced (0 min at start of occlusion). In the meantime, a dramatic increase
ofΔHbR could be seen at the start of occlusion (Fig. 8B). As the suture
was withdrawn one hour after MCAO, bothΔHbO
2
andΔHbR values
returned gradually toward the pre-MCAO baseline. However, both
ΔHbO
2
andΔHbR did not completely recover to the pre-surgery baseline.
Regarding the non-ischemic side of the rat brain in ROI-1, smallfluctuations
were found in bothΔHbO
2
andΔHbR, but there was no statistical
significance in either of them as compared to the pre-surgery baselines,
respectively.
Furthermore, statistical analysis was taken to compare respective
hemodynamic parameters (i.e., ΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR, ΔHbT) between the
two ROIs at selected time points (15 min right after MCAO, followed
by every 10 min thereafter), as marked in the top panel of Fig. 8.The
analysis results suggest that there exist significant differences in
ΔHbO
2
andΔHbR between the two ROIs during both periods of occlusion
and reperfusion, respectively. Fig. 8CshowsthatΔHbT in ROI-2
exhibited a similar trend to ΔHbO
2
; however, there was no statistical
difference in ΔHbT between the two ROIs at respective time points,
nor between the pre-MCAO baseline andΔHbT signals before, during,
and after MCAO surgery for each ROI.
For spatialdata analysis, the bottom panel ofFig. 8shows three characteristic
, time-evolving coronal images averaged over nine rats before,
during, and after MCAO (i.e., baseline, 35 min and 95 min after the suture
was introduced). Coronal images were sliced along the location
marked in Fig. 6B. This set of coronal images consistently reveals that
ROI-2 had a much greater decease in ΔHbO and an increase in ΔHbR
throughout most of ROI-2 during MCAO, and that the recoveries in
both parameters started to occur after the suture was removed; however
, recoveries were only partial within ROI-2.
Influence of ICG injection on hemodynamic signals
To investigate possible interference on changes of hemodynamic signals
from ICG injection, we compared hemodynamic changes taken from
both animal groups of G-I
no-ICG
and G-I
ICG
. Quantitative hemodynamic
changes from these two groups were analyzed using the same procedures
as described above. The time points chosen to quantify temporal
hemodynamic signals were interleaved with the time points for ICG administration
(seeInterleaved data acquisition and volumetric images for
hemodynamics and BFI section), so the inference from ICG absorption
should be minimal. Pearson's correlation coefficients between the two
groups (i.e., with and without ICG administration) were calculated
for ΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR, and ΔHbT, respectively, throughout the entire time
course and are shown in Fig. 9. The results demonstrate good positive
correlations between G-I
no-ICG
and G-I
ICG
within ROI-2 in ΔHbO
2
(r =
0.92; p b 0.001), ΔHbR (r = 0.90; p b 0.001) and ΔHbT (r = 0.84;
p b 0.001), as listed in Table 1. Relatively low correlations appear between
the two groups within ROI-1 for all three parameters (r = 0.52
for ΔHbO
2
, 0.54 for ΔHbR, and 0.27 for ΔHbT; p N 0.05; see Table 1
too). We do not expect a high correlation ofΔHbO
2
andΔHbR between
G-I
no-ICG
and G-I
ICG
in ROI-1 since ROI-1 was the no-injury side and had
no consistent pattern of hemodynamic changes observed from each
rat. Also, relatively small hemodynamic fluctuations were found
throughout entire measurements, but the changes were not significant
as compared to the pre-MCAO baseline as shown in Fig. 8. Overall, the

analysis on cerebral hemodynamic changes in the two animal groups
with and without ICG injection confirmed that the injection of ICG did
not significantly affect changes of hemodynamic signals.
Changes of cerebral hemodynamics in embolism-induced ischemic stroke
model
The top panel inFig. 10shows the quantitative time traces of hemodynamic
changes from two embolism-induced ischemia animal groups
of G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
(control group, n = 6) and G-II
ICG_rtPA
(treatment
group, n = 6). After using the same data analysis procedures as given
in Temporal and spatial analysis section, we clearly see that the
embolism-induced MCAO caused decreases ofΔHbO
2
on the ischemic
side of the rat brain (ROI-2) after embolization in both groups (down
to−5.2 ± 1.1 μM in G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
and−4.7 ± 1.3μMinG-II
ICG_rtPA
),
while increases of ΔHbR also occurred (up to 4.8 ± 1.2μM in 
G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
and 3.7 ± 1.2 μMinG-II
ICG_rtPA
). Further statistical analysis
on temporal profiles revealed that in ROI-2, there existed significant differences
inΔHbO
2
(see Fig. 10A) andΔHbR (see Fig. 10B) between the
pre-MCAO and post-MCAO readings during the three periods of occlusion
, treatment, and reperfusion, respectively, for both treated and
untreated groups. In ROI-1, on the other hand, there was no statistically
significant change ofΔHbO
2
(see Fig. 10A) andΔHbR (see Fig. 10B) between
pre- and post-MCAO signals.
In particular, for rtPA-treated rats, we found a trend of signal increases
in ΔHbO
2
(from −4.9 ± 1.3 μM to −3.3 ± 1.1 μM; see
Fig. 10A) and a trend of signal decreases in ΔHbR (from 3.4 ±
1.4 μMto2.2± 0.8μM; see Fig. 10B) in ROI-2 15 min after completion
of rtPA administration; these trends of recovery continued
throughout the entire reperfusion period. For untreated animals,
however, there was no significant change before and after injection
of saline in bothΔHbO
2
andΔHbR signals. During the recovery period
, we especially noticed that within 45 min and 55 min of completed
rtPA infusion, respectively, ΔHbR and ΔHbO
2
started to
show statistically significant differences between treated and
untreated animals, as marked in Fig. 10A. While a similar tendency
of ΔHbT to increase after rtPA infusion was noted in the treated
group,ΔHbT remained no significant changes between the treated
and untreated groups over the entire experimental period. No significant difference was seen between pre- and post-MCAO surgery
either.
For spatial data analysis, the two bottom panels of Fig. 10 show
three characteristic, time-evolving coronal images averaged over
six rats at time points before and during MCAO (i.e., baseline
and 35 min after embolism was introduced), as well as 35 min
after the 30-min rtPA/saline treatment. Images were sliced

across the center of optode array as shown in Fig. 6B. This set of
coronal images consistently reveals that the treated animal
group had a much better improvement than the untreated
group in both ΔHbO
2
and ΔHbR recovery 45–60 min after rtPA
administration, throughout most of ROI-2. However, within this
period of time, the recoveries in both parameters were only partial
within ROI-2.
Spatial distribution maps of ICG kinetics
Based on Fig. 4 and Eq. (9),wewereabletoquantifyvaluesof
∆ICG, RT and thus BFI at each FEM-mesh-based node. We were
then able to form volumetric images of respective ICG kinetic parameters
after obtaining 3D reconstruction of DOT. Fig. 11 shows
coronal views, close to the middle of the animal brain (as marked
in Fig. 6b), of averaged spatial distribution maps of∆ICG, RT and
BFI from normal rats without any occlusion (n = 6) and the rats
(n = 6) during embolism-induced MCAO. These spatial maps
were smoothed using 3 × 3 uniform kernels. Fig. 11Ashowsarelatively
symmetric pattern between the two hemispheres in each
of the ∆ICG, RT and BFI images/maps. Compared to Fig. 11A,
Fig. 11Bshowsalower∆ICG distribution over the entire ischemic
(left) side of rat brain due to the lack of ICG delivery caused by
MCA occlusion. Moreover, the RT map displays increases in the
transit time of ICG on the ischemic side of hemispheres during occlusion.
No such differences between the two hemispheres can be
observed in normal rats. Accordingly, the spatial maps of BFI also
indicate decreases of cerebral blood flow on the ischemic side of 
the rat brain.
ICG kinetics in suture-induced ischemic model
To calculate time-evolving dynamic changes of BFI throughout the
entire measurements before, during and after the suture-induced
MCAO, we obtained the spatial BFI maps at the chosen coronal plane
(see Fig. 6B) at different time points for each of the G-I
ICG
rats and
then normalized their BFI maps individually between their respective
maximum and minimum values. Values of normalized BFI were
extracted at each node and spatially averaged, respectively, within
ROI-1 and ROI-2 (as defined in Fig. 7). As mentioned in Calculation of
ICG kinetics and data analysis section, it is not appropriate to make
intra-subject comparisons of BFI because of unknown normalization
factors among different animals (Wagner et al., 2003). Thus, we introduced
the BFI ratio, Ratio
BFI
,as
BFI
s averaged ROI−2
BFI
s averaged ROI−1
,whereBFI
s _ averaged _ ROI− 1
and BFI
s _ averaged _ ROI− 2
are spatially averaged over each voxel or node
within entire regions of ROI-1 and ROI-2, respectively, for each animal.
Based on this definition, we obtained a temporal profile (top panel of
Fig. 12)ofRatio
BFI
, expressed as a relative reduction of BFI on the occlusion
/stroke side with respect to the control side at different time points.
For inter-subject comparison, BFI ratios at different time points for each
rat were firstly computed and then BFI ratios across the rats were
averaged as a group mean of Ratio
BFI
. To demonstrate the variability in
Ratio
BFI
among rats, more detailed experimental data are given in Supplementary
Material 1. Fig. 12 resulted from an average of six rats; it
clearly demonstrates that much less bloodflow occurred on the ischemic
hemisphere during MCAO, followed by a significant increase after suture
was withdrawn, which is a clear indication of prompt recovery of blood
reperfusion. Quantitatively, the time trace in Fig. 12 illustrates that the
ratio of BFIs between the ischemic and normal side dropped to about
14% (14 ± 11%) during MCAO, recovered to 77% (77 ± 12%) 10 min
after MCAO, and then remained at an average of 79% (79 ± 13%) of BFI
in ROI-1. The bottom panels of Fig. 12 show the corresponding spatial

ICG kinetics in embolism-induced ischemic model
Using the same data processing approach, we analyzed ICG
kinetics of the two embolism-induced ischemic rat models:
namely, G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
and G-II
ICG_rtPA
. The corresponding temporal
curves for the two animal groups are given in Fig. 13. Note 
that rtPA was injected at 60 min after MCAO started, followed
by a 30-min treatment period; then the first ICG injection for
BFI measurement was administered 10 min after the treatment
(i.e., 100 min after MCAO or 40 min after rtPA). A trend of recovery
in BFI on the left hemisphere is revealed in this figure
for G-II
ICG_rtPA
rats after rtPA administration while no obvious
change was found for G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
rats after saline injection.
Specifically, for the untreated group, the normalized Ratio
BFI
in
ROI-2 (the ischemic side) dropped to 41% (41 ± 12%) with respect
to the BFI over ROI-1 30 min after embolization followed
by no changes thereafter. For the rtPA-treated animals, the normalized Ratio
BFI
from ROI-2 decreased to 34% (34 ± 12%) of the
BFI over ROI-1 during occlusion, followed by a gradual return to
59% (59 ± 17%) at 10 min after completion of rtPA administration
(100 min after MCAO) and to 82% (82 ± 18%) at ~60 min
after completion of the treatment (~150 min after MCAO). Statistical
differences between the treated and untreated groups
were found 30 min after completion of rtPA/saline injection; results
remained consistent thereafter.
Moreover, bottom left panels of Fig. 13 show the corresponding
spatial maps of normalized BFI ratios during embolic MCAO
for both treated (Fig. 13C) and untreated (Fig. 13B) rat groups,
exhibiting a similar low Ratio
BFI
on the ischemic side. During reperfusion

of Ratio
BFI
on the ischemic side of the treated rats appeared to
gradually recover throughout the lesion region and exhibit a

Discussion
In this paper, we presented an experimental study of ischemic
stroke using rat MCAO models and high-density DOT measurements.
After utilizing DCA and co-registering the optical probes
on a rat brain template, we were able to obtain rat brain atlasguided
, volumetric DOT. In particular, an interleaved data acquisition
and analysis process was planned and implemented so that
we were able to obtain 3D visualization of hemodynamic changes
and CBF index in the rat brain, with or without a thrombolytic
treatment. Several special aspects of this study are summarized
and discussed below.
Rat brain atlas-guided, volumetric DOT
While DOT suffers from lack of showing anatomical structures,
we could calculate hemodynamic changes and compare corresponding
differences between ROIs based on anatomical locations
if MR images with prior structure information were incorporated.
It is well known that reconstruction performances and spatial resolutions
of DOT can be enhanced by using a priori structural information
(Brooksby et al., 2006; Pogue and Paulsen, 1998), where
imaging volumes can be divided into anatomical regions or contours
, as ROIs, identified from prior images by MRI or CT. Accordingly
, the identified ROIs can be assigned with heterogeneous
optical properties so as to reduce the number of unknown optical
properties in image reconstructions or in spatial constraint
methods (Zhan et al., 2012). However, the key issue of these
methods is that accurate subject-specific prior information needs
to be acquired. In this study, we used the prioranatomical information
to extract ROIs and to project reconstructed volumetric DOT
images on a rat brain atlas. Since we did not have subject-specific
MR images for each rat, the rat brain atlas-guided DOT matched appropriate
anatomical locations only as a group-averaged approximation
, but it still provided us with estimated anatomic views of
in vivo ischemic rat brains non-invasively. Also, the image reconstruction
process described in this study can be easily applied
when subject-specific prior information is available.
Arrangement of optodes may affect the measurement sensitivity
, MS, and quality of image reconstruction. Xu et al. (2003)
presented the improvement of sensitivity and image quality for
deeper tissue structures by adding extra array-opposing fibers,
which provided transmission measurements. In our animal measurements
, fibers were placed on top of the animal's scalp, providing
a back-reflection optode arrangement. It has also been shown
that mathematical compensation algorithms can help greatly improve
accuracy of depth localization for deeper tissue structures.
Such depth compensated methods have been reported to counterbalance
the decrease in measurement sensitivity with increase in
depth, thus benefiting the image quality of DOT. Most of the approaches
have been developed to image human brain activities
(Niu et al., 2010a) or to detect human cancers (Tavakoli and Zhu,
2011; Xu and Piao, 2012). For animal studies, on the other hand,
Culver et al. (2003b) presented an approach using spatially variant
regularization to monitor rat brain activation. In this study, our recently
developed DCA was adopted to compensate the sensitivity
loss in deeper layers and also to reduce the sensitivity on the superficial layer near the optode or measurement surface.
Effects of baseline optical properties and mesh densities on reconstructed
DOT images
It is expected that different baseline optical properties lead to different
values of reconstructed hemodynamic changes (i.e., ΔHbO and

ΔHbR) since the measurement sensitivity matrix, J
rh
, is generated accordingly
based on baseline optical parameters (see Rat head model
and forward light modeling section). Since a large diversity in optical
properties of a rat head has been reported by different research groups,
we investigated in this sub-section the degree of deviation in
reconstructed hemodynamic parameters induced by different baseline
optical properties, which were published by several groups. Table 2
lists several sets of published optical properties of a rat head: Set 1
was used earlier in this paper (see Rat head model and forward light
modeling section and Bluestone et al., 2004a) to obtain reconstructed
hemodynamic images due to suture-induced MCAO (Figs. 6 and 8)
and embolism-induced MCAO with and without rtPA treatment
(Fig. 10). The parameters of Set 2 were introduced by Pogue and
Paulsen (1998), who noted a larger absorption coefficient in the rat
brain tissues than that in the skin/muscle, which was a somewhat different
trend when compared to that in Set 1. Both of these sets list
very similar reduced scattering coefficients.
Besides baseline optical properties, mesh distributions and densities
may affect spatial reconstructions of hemodynamic parameters.
To demonstrate this point, the baseline optical properties of
a rat head in Set 3 had the same homogeneous values of absorption
and reduced scattering coefficients, respectively, for each of the
three layers that were seen in the three-layer model used in Sets
1 and 2. On the other hand, Set 4 assumed only a one-layer homogenous
model, having the same optical properties as those in Set 3
(Schmitz et al., 2005).
Figs. 14A to D show cross-sectionalcontours of reconstructedΔHbO
2
images duringcerebralischemia when four differentsets of baseline optical
properties or mesh distributions were utilized to generate the MS
matrix, J
rh
. Fig. 14A shows a more dramatic decrease in ΔHbO
2
near
the upper regions (due to larger absorption and scattering properties)
but illustrates a more uniformΔHbO
2
distribution in deeper/central regions
, as compared to those in other panels.Figs. 14B to C reveal a similar ΔHbO
2
distribution pattern as most concentration changes are
located on the left side of the rat brain. Fig. 14D, on the other hand,
shows a more diffused and symmetrical/spherical pattern ofΔHbO
2
as
we look into the left side of hemisphere because of its one-layer homogenous
model.
More quantitatively, ascompared to optical properties givenbySet 1
used in this study, we found an averaged 38% increase inΔHbO
2
amplitude
(~30 min afterocclusion within ROI-2) when Set2 was beingused,
a 3% decrease in amplitude when Set 3 was being used, and a 34% decrease
in amplitude when Set 4 was being used. This variation trend is
further illustrated byFig. 14E, which was obtained by comparing the respective
time traces of ΔHbO
2
from ROI-2 when using 4 sets of background
optical properties. High correlations (r = 0.97–0.99; p b 0.05)
are observed between theΔHbO
2
results with Set 1 background properties
and those with the other three sets of background properties (see
Fig. 14E). Overall, this analysis demonstrated that baseline optical properties
do affect reconstructed changes in amplitudes of hemodynamic
parameters, but they will not affect the trend of dynamic changes
throughout the process.
Two types of MCAO rat models
Two rat MCAO models were measured and investigated in this
study. The first model, where focal ischemia was carried out with
suture-introduced intraluminal MCAO, has been well developed and
widely used to investigate stroke physiology and intervention-related
effects by fMRI, PET, and NIRS. Thus, we used it to validate our experimental
setup of high-density DOT, to examine interleaved data acquisition
and analysis process, and to confirm our volumetric reconstruction
methodology. In this part of study, results show statistically significant
differences as evidenced by a decrease of ΔHbO
2
and an increase of
ΔHbR during the occlusion period across the injured brain side, ROI-2
(seeFig. 8). These significant changes started within the early ischemic
period (10–15 min after suture was introduced), followed by the recovery
ofΔHbO
2
andΔHbR in the early period of reperfusion. An indicator
of total blood volume (ΔHbT), however, did not show any statistical difference
in its change as compared to that at the pre-surgery baseline. All
the observations were consistent with previous publications (Culver
et al., 2003a; Liu et al., 2008).
A newly developed embolism-induced ischemic model, which more
closely mimics ischemic stroke in humans than the suture model, was
also measured and investigated in this study. In general, this embolic
stroke model provides more precise lodgment or simulation of clots at
MCA bifurcation, thus improving the reproducibility and similarity of ischemic
injury. Also, treatment of ischemic stroke with rtPA has been
well documented, which helps restore blood flow and oxygen in the
focal stroke region affected by embolism-induced cerebral ischemia in
both humans (Berrouschot et al., 2000) and animals ( Busch et al.,
1998; Haelewyn et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 1998). In this study, we
were able to demonstrate that time-evolving effects or longitudinal
monitoring of thrombolytic therapy with rtPA could be achieved by
non-invasive volumetric DOT using the embolic MCAO rat model. Specifically
, the treated G-II
ICG-rtPA
animal group exhibited gradual recovery in
both cerebral hemodynamics (Fig. 10) and blood reperfusion (Fig. 13),
similar to those seen after withdrawal of the suture in the sutureinduced
MCAO model (Figs. 8 and 12). After recanalization, however,
the recovery of increasingΔHbO
2
and decreasingΔHbR were found to
be slower as compared to those in the suture model since the process
of clot breakdown took time, relatively much slower than withdrawing
a suture. In order to validate our DOTresults, we also performed histology
analysis on the post-surgery animal brains and found small
breaking-down clots at a couple of peripheral branches of MCA, but
only in one of the six rtPA-treated rats; however, no significant effect
was observed when checking for changes in hemodynamic
parameters. Both temporal and spatial results from G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
rats reveal
the outcome of a permanent rat MCAO model, while the hemodynamic
changes reconstructed from G-II
ICG_rtPA
animals represent

Advantages of interleaved data acquisition and analysis
One novelty of this study was to develop and achieve interleaved data
acquisition and analysis (seeFig. 2) in order to obtain both hemodynamic
parameters (ΔHbO
2
andΔHbR) and BFI, or to obtain volumetric DOT
images ofΔHbO
2
,ΔHbR, andBFIduring and after ischemic stroke. Specifically
, we determined and utilized a 10-min inter-injection interval
based on our pilot study, which showed a rapid clearance time of ICG
to be ~5 min or shorter in the blood stream of a living biological system
(such as rats). Then, the measured optical density changes by multichannel
NIRS were temporally interleaved into two categories during
data analysis: 1) the data taken 0–5 min right after ICG administration
was used to derive BFI;and2)thedatacollected5 –10 min after ICG injection
gave rise toΔHbO
2
andΔHbR, with small interference from ICG
absorption. This enabled us to acquire volumetric DOT images of
ΔHbO
2
,ΔHbR, and BFI, before, during, and after MCAO in both ischemic
stroke rat models.
It is known, however, that NIRS or DOT measurements would be
perturbed by multiple ICG injections, potentially by a small amount of
ICG residual, thus leading to possible errors in quantification ofΔHbO
2
andΔHbR. To avoid such faulty outcomes,we carefully studied the effect
of transit ICG injection on changes of hemodynamic parameters (see
Interleaved data acquisition and volumetric images for hemodynamics
andBFIand Influence of ICG injection on hemodynamic signalssections,
and Fig. 9). We found that each of the hemodynamic parameters (i.e.,
ΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR, and ΔHbT) are highly correlated between G-I
no_ICG
and
G-I
ICG
on the ischemic side, indicating no significant effects due to ICG injection
on trends of ΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR, and ΔHbT during and after sutureinduced
MCAO. Also, the body-weight-proportioned ICG concentration
was carefully calculated and diluted several times for injection; we
expected to have minimal ICG accumulation or recirculation. There was
one clear peak found in temporal profiles of optical density changes
per ICG injection, but it did not affect results. De Visscher et al. (2002)
also observed a lack of ICG accumulation or recirculation in related
experiments.
To investigate the reduction of CBF during cerebral ischemia, ICG-
tracking technique was employed in our study. For a suture-induced
MCAO model, it has been well documented that occlusion leads to a decrease
in CBF to approximately 30% to 40% of the pre-ischemic baseline
(Alkayed et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1994). CBF was recovered to approximate
80% of the baseline after reperfusion (Liu et al., 2008). Our results
exhibited thatBFIon the ischemic side dropped to approximately 14% of
that on the control side during occlusion and then returned to 79%. In
terms of the embolism-induced MCAO model, our study shows a
relatively broader range of CBF drop after embolization compared to
the suture-induced MCAO model. rtPA-mediated recanalization also
exhibited a different range of CBF recovery. The reason could be the
complexity of embolic model itself, e.g., length of clots, types of clot,
etc. Our results showed that BFI on the ischemic side dropped to approximately
34% of that on the control side in G-II
ICG-rtPA
after embolization
and then returned to about 82% after rtPA treatment. The BFIratio
decreased to 40% during the occlusion and remained stable with no significant changes after saline injection in G-II
ICG_no-rtPA
. Similar results
were reported consistently byHaelewyn et al. (2010)where rats were
only administered with saline after embolization.
Notice that a large standard deviation is shown in our analysis and
may be caused by the inter-subject variation. Although all procedures
were done by a well-trained surgeon, the differences among animals
still could not be eliminated. Notice that the BFI ratios in this study
were calculated based on the assumption that no significant changes
occurred on the control regions during MCAO and reperfusion for
both rat models. Culver et al. (2003a) showed that CBF on the control
side of animal brain remained relatively stable during occlusion and
reperfusion in rats with the suture-induced ischemic stroke model.
Haelewyn et al. (2010) also presented no significant changes on the
non-ischemic side of rat brain when using the embolism-induced
model. Although ICG-tracking techniques do not allow absolute quantification of CBF, our results demonstrated the feasibility of using
continuous-wave NIRS measurement combined with ICG-tracking
strategy to study the trend of dynamic changes of CBF due to cerebral
ischemia.
Influence of ICG on quantification of hemodynamic variables
InInfluence of ICG injection on hemodynamic signalssection and
Table 1, we showed that the slopes of correlations ofΔHbO
2
,ΔHbR,
and ΔHbTinROI-2betweenG-I
ICG
and G-I
no_ICG
are 0.77, 0.89, and
0.55, while the respective correlation coefficients are high (0.90,
0.92, and 0.84). The implication of this set of results seems that readings
ofΔHbO
2
,ΔHbR, andΔHbT induced by MCAO in the rat brains
are affected by ICG injections. To examine whether an increase in
ICG clearance time between adjacent ICG injections could help increase
the correlation slopes between the two rat groups with and
without ICG interventions, we computed the correlations between
the two groups at 5, 7, and 9 min after ICG injections. Table 3 lists

the corresponding values for all threeΔHbO
2
, ΔHbR, andΔHbT parameters
at three post-injection times. Paired t-tests were
performed between the two groups at each of the three time points
and gave rise to no statistically significant difference between them,
respectively, as given in the table. Furthermore, results from oneway
ANOVA also show no significant differences among three different
time marks for all hemodynamic parameters (p =0.89  for
ΔHbO
2
, p =0.94forΔHbR and p =0.52forΔHbT). In conclusion,
the interference of ICG residuals was not large enough to cause a significant effect in hemodynamic changes during and after ischemic
stroke.
To completely minimize or eliminate the interference of ICG residuals
, there are other approaches. First, we may reduce the concentration
of ICG or injection volume and/or increase the interinjection
period. However, this approach may cause decease in
signal-to-noise ratio for ICG kinetics, leading to quantification errors
during calculations. Also, increasing the inter-injection period will
cause a loss of temporal resolution, which means we collect fewer
temporal points to help determine the dynamic changes of CBF.
Further investigation on how to optimally design the interleaved
temporal data acquisition will help strengthen the proposed methodology.
Ultimately, we wish to separate absorption of ICG from
those of hemoglobin derivatives with minimal cross-talks between
them. This can be achieved by increasing the number of wavelengths
used from two to three or more, so absorption of ICG and
that of hemoglobin species (HbO and HbR) can be quantified simultaneously
and independently.
For the embolism-induced model, we did not particularly study the
interference of ICG injections to validate our methodology. However,
since we have observed and shown similar spatial and temporal
changes in hemodynamic parameters (compare Figs. 8 and 10) and 
Ratio
BFI
patterns (compareFigs. 12 and 13) in the two MCAO rat models,
we expect to have a similar effect of ICG on the signals measured for the
embolism-induced model.
Comparison of ratios of BFI before and after MCAO
As shown inFigs. 11 to 13, increases inBFIandRatio
BFI
are observed
after either suture removal or rtPA treatment. It would be also interesting
to compare Ratio
BFI
values during recovery to the baseline values
obtained before MCAO. Since the baseline values of Ratio
BFI
in MCAO
rats before surgery should be equivalent to those from normal rats
(n = 6) without MCAO surgery, we used Ratio
BFI
values of normal rats
as the baseline for comparison. Specifically, the averaged Ratio
BFI
for 6
normal rats was 98.4 ± 8.2%. We also identified Ratio
BFI
values from
suture-induced MCAO rats (N = 6) at six different time points (with a
10-min temporal interval) after suture removal. As shown in Fig. 11A
in ICG kinetics in suture-induced ischemic model section, a symmetric
pattern ofBFIbetween two hemispheres is clear. After comparing baselineBFIratio with those at different time points after suture removal, as
shown by Inline Supplementary Fig. S2, we obtained several observations
: 1) no obvious changes inBFIratios were found during the period
of reperfusion, meaning that CBF remained a relative stable level during
reperfusion;and 2) themeanBFIratios after suture removal werestatistically
lower than that in baseline, indicating that CBF did not recover
completely to the pre-surgery status although they increased greatly
(see Fig. 12). This observation is consistent with those presented by
Liu et al. (2008), reporting that CBF measured by Laser Doppler
flowmetry did not return to pre-surgery baseline.
Inline Supplementary Fig. S2 can be found online at http://dx.doi.
org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.07.020.
ThedecreaseinCBFontheischemichemisphereafterMCAOcouldbe
due to the MCAO model itself. In our suture-induced ischemic stroke, the
left common carotid artery (CCA) was permanently cauterized during
MCAO surgery. Blood could be supplied only from contralateral side or
the non-ischemic hemisphere for blood circulation. However, somewhat
inconsistent conclusions on CBF recovery after reperfusion were reported
by different research groups. The inconsistency may result from uses of
different measurement modalities as the fundamental physics and data
processing method for each modality are different. Even with the same
modality (Laser Dopplerflowmetry) to measure CBFrecovery after reperfusion
, Tureyen et al. (2004) showed CBF returned to the baseline level
within 20 min while Liu et al. demonstrated CBF did not recover to baseline
even 60 min after suture was withdrawn. Our results provide good
agreement with those by Liu et al., but a definite conclusion on time evolution
of CBF recovery remains to be confirmed by future studies.
Weakness of the study
While we demonstrated in preceding sections that we can combine
DOT with an ICG-tracking method to achieve interleaved 3D images of
cerebral hemodynamics and bloodflow index in two MCAO rat models,
the spatial resolution is still limited by the nature of light scattering in
tissues. With a dense optode array used in this study (see Fig. 1B), the
best spatial resolution that we could achieve is still in a severalmillimeter
range, not permitting to observe detailed structures of occluded
blood vessels. This intrinsic limitation might be improved by
using a photo-acoustic approach (Wang and Hu, 2012), which needs
further exploration and confirmation. Another weakness of the current
method is the requirement for frequentinjectionsof ICG because it is invasive
and is limited by the totalnumber of injections or by themaximal
injected volume of ICG that a subject can tolerate. Further technical development
is necessary in order to solve this problem, but it is beyond
the focus of this study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have utilized a continuous-wave DOT system to
study and image the changes of hemodynamic parameters resulting
from suture-induced and embolism-induced rat stroke models. Meanwhile
, by using the same experimental setup with the ICG-tracking
method, we were able to investigate dynamic changes in cerebral perfusion
at multiple temporal points during and after cerebral ischemia without
extra instrumentation and with little interference of measurements.
Moreover, utilizing DCA to achieve volumetric image reconstruction facilitated
3D hemodynamics (i.e., HbO
2
and Hb) and BFI imaging. The
methodology developed in this study also provided us with an excellent
visualization and quantification tool to gain insight into cerebral changes
at different sites of the rat brain undergoing ischemic stroke or treatment.
Our analyzed results have exhibited consistent patterns of changes
in cerebral hemodynamics and perfusion from both rat models during
occlusion and reperfusion, and they are also in good agreement with previous
studies. Overall, this research demonstrates that the interleaved
imaging approach as shown herein is a useful and feasible tool to study
stroke physiology and can also be used in evaluating the effect of
thrombolysis.
