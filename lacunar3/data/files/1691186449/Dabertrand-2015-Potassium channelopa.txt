Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), caused by dominant mutations
in the NOTCH3 receptor in vascular smooth muscle, is a genetic
paradigm of small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain. Recent studies
using transgenic (Tg)Notch3R169C mice, a genetic model of CADASIL,
revealed functional defects in cerebral (pial) arteries on the surface
of the brain at an early stage of disease progression. Here,
using parenchymal arterioles (PAs) from within the brain, we determined
the molecular mechanism underlying the early functional
deficits associated with thisNotch3mutation. At physiological pressure
(40 mmHg), smooth muscle membrane potential depolarization
and constriction to pressure (myogenic tone) were blunted in PAs
from TgNotch3R169Cmice. This effect was associated with an∼60%
increase in the number of voltage-gated potassium (K
V
) channels,
which oppose pressure-induced depolarization. Inhibition of K
V
1
channels with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or treatment with the epidermal
growth factor receptor agonist heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF),
which promotes K
V
1 channel endocytosis, reduced K
V
current density
and restored myogenic responses in PAs from TgNotch3R169C
mice, whereas pharmacological inhibition of other major vasodilatory
influences had no effect. K
V
1 currents and myogenic responses
were similarly altered in pial arteries from TgNotch3R169C mice, but
not in mesenteric arteries. Interestingly, HB-EGF had no effect on
mesenteric arteries, suggesting a possible mechanistic basis for the
exclusive cerebrovascular manifestation of CADASIL. Collectively,
our results indicate that increasing the number of K
V
1 channels in
cerebral smooth muscle produces a mutant vascular phenotype akin
to a channelopathy in a genetic model of SVD.

Small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain accounts for about
one-fourth of ischemic strokes worldwide and is a leading
cause of cognitive decline and disability (1). Alteration of cerebral
arterioles, capillaries, or venules gives rise to white matter lesions
and subcortical lacunar infarcts (2). A mix of genetic and environmental
factors drives SVD, with both sporadic and inherited
forms identified (1). Despite the importance of SVD, there is no
specific treatment, mainly due to a limited understanding of the
disease pathogenesis. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is
an archetypal SVD that emerges as the most common heritable
cause of stroke and vascular dementia in adults (3). It presents
an autosomal dominant mode of transmission through stereotyped
missense mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of
NOTCH3 (NOTCH3ECD), a transmembrane receptor that undergoes
proteolytic cleavage to release its ECD and an intracellular
fragment, which translocates to the nucleus and acts as
a transcription factor. NOTCH3 is predominantly expressed in
vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and is critically required
for the maturation and function of small vessels (3, 4). Although
mutant NOTCH3 is also expressed in SMCs of peripheral
arteries, clinical manifestations are restricted to the
brain (2, 3).
The NOTCH3ECD contains 34 epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) repeats, each of which contains six cysteine
residues that are presumably critical structural determinants.
Almost all CADASIL-associated NOTCH3 mutations identified
to date involve substitutions that result in one or more EGFR
repeats having an odd number of cysteines (3). A recently developed
transgenic mouse model of CADASIL expressing the
mutant protein NOTCH3(R169C), encoded by one such naturally
occurring CADASIL mutation, has been shown to recapitulate the
preclinical stages of the disease. In CADASIL, white matter lesions
are the most consistent and earliest abnormalities, preceding the
onset of other symptoms by 10–15 y (3). In the transgenic (Tg)
Notch3R169C mouse model, white matter lesions are detectable at
12 mo, but impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF)
and diminished contractile responses to intravascular pressure
(myogenic tone) in isolated pial arteries appear as early as 6 mo (5,
6). Neurovascular coupling (NVC)—the process by which neuronal
activity is linked to the microvasculature to promote the local vasodilation
necessary to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients and
oxygen to active neurons—is also disrupted in young (∼6-mo-old)
TgNotch3R169C mice. Thus, cerebrovascular dysfunction emerges
as an early event in the pathogenesis of SVD (5).
The topology of the brain vasculature creates distinct pathological
predispositions. In contrast to the robust pial and capillary
Significance
Small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain refers to a group of
pathological processes leading to cerebral lesions, cognitive
decline, and stroke. Despite the importance of SVD, there is no
specific treatment, mainly due to a limited understanding of the
disease pathogenesis. Using a recently developed mouse model
of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a hereditary form of SVD, we
determined the basis of altered brain artery function at an early
stage of disease progression. We found that cerebrospecific upregulation
of the voltage-gated potassium channel, K
V
1, prevents
intracerebral arterioles from constricting in response to
physiological levels of intraluminal pressure. This impairment of
a fundamental vascular function is expected to impact cerebral
blood flow autoregulation and local dilation in response to
neuronal activity (functional hyperemia).

networks, which are rich in anastomoses, parenchymal arterioles
(PAs) form a fragile, one-dimensional organization with limited
collateral supply (7). This “stovepiping” creates a bottleneck effect
that makes the column of brain parenchyma served by a given PA
especially vulnerable to insults thataffectflowthroughthatPA(7).
Thus, perhaps not surprisingly, PAs are major sites of vulnerability
during the progression of vascular diseases (8, 9), including
CADASIL and other sporadic forms of SVD (2, 10, 11).
Arteries and arterioles in vivo exhibit myogenic tone, a partially
constricted state that allows further constriction or dilation
in response to moment-to-moment fluctuations in blood pressure
(9, 12). Myogenic tone is an intrinsic and fundamental feature of
small arteries and arterioles that protects capillaries from disruptive
high blood pressure; in the cerebral microcirculation, it provides
the vasodilatory reserve necessary for effective NVC
(13). The myogenic response is initiated by elevation of intravascular
pressure, which causes a graded SMC membrane potential
depolarization that activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
(VDCCs), increasing Ca2+ entry and promoting vasoconstriction
(14–16). Large-conductance, Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK
Ca
) channels
and voltage-gated K+ (K
V
) channels function as negative feedback
elements that, when activated, serve as a brake on pressureinduced
depolarization and constriction (15). Elevations in vasodilatory
influences, such as nitric oxide (NO) and endothelialdependent
hyperpolarization, can also oppose the development
of arteriolar tone (17). Although myogenic tone is reduced in pial
arteries from TgNotch3R169C mice, it is not known whether similar
effects manifest in PAs, the preferential target of the SVD
process. Moreover, it is not known what molecular mechanism
underlies this CADASIL-related vascular defect or why disease
manifestations are restricted to the cerebrovascular circulation.
Here, we sought to determine whether—and how—NOTCH3
(R169C) produces the mutant cerebrovascular phenotype in PAs,
focusing on the myogenic response, and explored the differential
effects of this mutant in the peripheral and brain vasculature.
Results
PAs from TgNotch3R169C Mice Exhibit Diminished Constriction to
Pressure in the Physiological Range. To investigate the effects
of NOTCH3(R169C) expression on cerebrovascular myogenic
responses, we measured changes in the diameter of precapillary
segments of PAs from 6-mo-old TgNotch3R169Cmice in response
to changes in intraluminal pressure (Fig. 1 A and B). Transgenic
mice overexpressing WT NOTCH3 (TgNotch3WT) and 
nontransgenic (Non-Tg) mice were used as controls. Elevation of
intraluminal pressure to 20 mmHg constricted PAs from Non-Tg,

pressures above 30 mmHg. (A) Typical recordings of

TgNotch3WT, and TgNotch3R169Cmice to a similar extent (∼20%).
However, at higher pressures, TgNotch3R169Carterioles constricted
significantly less than control arterioles. At 40 mmHg, the estimated
pressure experienced in vivo by cerebral arterioles of this size
(18), TgNotch3R169C PAs constricted 38% less than controls
(Fig. 1 A and B). These results indicate that the mutant protein
affects a process that it is triggered by elevated pressure. Consistent
with our previous report (5), we found that myogenic response to
elevation of intravascular pressure to 60 mmHg was similarly diminished
in posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) from TgNotch3R169C
mice (Table S1). Myogenic responses in both PCAs and PAs from
TgNotch3WT mice were not significantly different from those in
Non-Tg mice (Table S1 and Fig. 1 A and B), indicating that overexpression
of the WT receptor did not affect myogenic tone.
The development of arteriolar tone, even at lower pressures,
depends on Ca2+ influx via activated VDCCs, a process initiated
by membrane potential depolarization (16, 19, 20). Conversely,
membrane potential hyperpolarization can rapidly dilate cerebral
arteries by deactivating VDCCs. The lack of difference in myogenic
tone at 20 mmHg suggested that VDCC activity was unaltered in
TgNotch3R169C PAs. To confirm this and assess the integrity of the
contractile apparatus, we manipulated the membrane potential by
increasing external K+ concentration ([K+]
o
) and measured arteriolar
diameter. Modest elevations of [K+]
o
(to <20 mM) cause
membrane potential hyperpolarization by activating strong inward
rectifier K+ (K
ir
) channels (21), whereas elevations of [K+]
o
above
25 mM cause membrane potential depolarization. Although there
was an apparent trend toward reduced dilation in TgNotch3R169C
mice, this nonsignificant difference is an artifact, reflecting the presentation
method, which expressed dilation relative to baseline to
allow both constriction and dilation to be shown on the same graphs,
and the fact that PAs from these animals had less tone compared
with controls. When expressed relative to the diameter of fully dilated
vessels, elevation of extracellular K+concentration from 3 mM
to 20 mM caused almost a maximal dilation of arterioles in all
groups. Therefore, at 40 mmHg, the relationship between [K+]
o
and
PA diameter for TgNotch3R169C mice was essentially the same as
that for TgNotch3WT and Non-Tg control mice (Fig. 1 C and D),
indicating that the mutant NOTCH3(R169C) protein does not
affect K
ir
-mediated dilation, VDCC-dependent constriction, or the
contractile response of PAs.
Membrane Potential Hyperpolarization Underlies the Diminished
Arteriolar Tone in TgNotch3R169C Mice. One likely explanation for
the diminished myogenic response in TgNotch3R169C mice is
blunted membrane potential depolarization to pressure. We have
previously shown that the relationship between membrane potential
and diameter/Ca2+ of pial arteries (16) and parenchymal
arterioles (19) is very steep and that membrane depolarization
from −60 mV to −30 mV causes an artery to transition from
full dilation to full constriction. This relationship predicts that a
9-mV hyperpolarization (equivalent to blunting depolarization by
9 mV) could account for the diminished tone in arterioles from
TgNotch3R169Cmice at a pressure of 40 mmHg (19). At a holding
pressure of 10 mmHg, SMC membrane potentials were −54 ±
2 mV, −52 ± 1 mV, and −53 ± 1 mV in isolated PAs from
TgNotch3R169C, TgNotch3WT, and Non-Tg mice, respectively (Fig.
2 A and B), consistent with the similar degree of constriction observed
at this pressure. In contrast, increasing intraluminal pressure
to 40 mmHg depolarized the membrane potential of SMCs in
arterioles of TgNotch3WT and Non-Tg animals by 16.5 mV and
18.3 mV, respectively, but depolarized SMCs in arterioles from
TgNotch3R169C mice by only 9.4 mV—adifferenceveryclosetothe
predicted value. To further examine this relationship, we fitted
a linear regression to the relationship between the percentage of
myogenic tone and membrane potential, using values obtained from
Non-Tg and TgNotch3WT animals (Fig. 2C). At −44.2 mV—the
membrane potential observed in PAs from TgNotch3R169C mice
pressurized to 40 mmHg—this linear equation predicted a myogenic
tone of 24%. Remarkably, the average tone observed in PAs from
TgNotch3R169C mice—22%±2%—was very close to the predicted
value and in fact was contained within the 95% confidence interval
of the linear regression. Therefore, the blunted depolarization to
pressure is sufficient to account for the reduction in myogenic tone.
The Diminished Myogenic Tone in PAs from TgNotch3R169C Mice Is Not
Attributable to Increases in Endothelial Vasodilator Influences or
Smooth Muscle BK Channel Activity. The endothelium exerts a
tonic dilatory influence on the diameter of PAs that is mediated,
in part, by the activity of endothelial small- and intermediateconductance
, calcium-sensitive K+ channels (SK and IK, respectively
) (22). Thus, one potential explanation for the decreased
depolarization to pressure in TgNotch3R169C PAs could be hyperpolarization
of the smooth muscle membrane potential due
to increased SK and/or IK channel activity. However, the vasoconstriction
induced by inhibition of endothelial SK channels
with 100 nM apamin or IK channels with 300 nM charybdotoxin
(in the presence of the BK channel blocker paxilline) was not
different between TgNotch3R169C and control (TgNotch3WT and
Non-Tg) PAs (Fig. 3 A and B). The synthetic IK and SK channel
agonist, NS309 (1 μM), which shifts Ca2+ sensitivity to lower
concentrations, caused a rapid and reversible dilation that was
prevented by inhibition of IK and SK channels (Fig. 3). Vasoconstrictor
responses to inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) with L-NAME (100μM) were similarly unaffected in
TgNotch3R169C PAs (Fig. 3 A and B). Collectively, these results
indicate that elevated endothelial function is not responsible for
the decreased myogenic tone observed in TgNotch3R169C PAs.
Although BK channels exert powerful negative feedback regulation
of membrane potential and tone in pressurized pial
arteries (23), these channels do not appear to play a significant
role in PAs under physiological conditions (22, 24). Consistent
with this, the myogenic response of TgNotch3R169C PAs measured
over a range of intravascular pressures was the same in the
presence and absence of the BK channel blocker paxilline
(1μM) (Fig. 3 C and D), suggesting that a change in BK channel
activity is not likely the common denominator.
PAs from TgNotch3R169C Mice Are Hypersensitive to 4-Aminopyridine.
The compound 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) preferentially blocks
members of the K
V
1 family (25), which exert powerful negative
feedback control over vasoconstriction in pial arteries (26) and
PAs (27). In particular, molecular evidence indicates that K
V
1.2
and K
V
1.5 channels underlie the 4-AP sensitivity of K+ currents,
membrane potential, and tone in arteries (28–32) and PAs (27).
Here, we found that 4-AP (1 mM and 5 mM) induced a concentration-dependent
constriction of PAs from mice of all genotypes
(Fig. 4A, a–c). Importantly, the degree of vasoconstriction
was greater in TgNotch3R169C PAs, suggesting higher K
V
1 activity
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, with K
V
1 activity inhibited (1 mM
4-AP), PAs from all three genotypes constricted to the same
level in response to pressure (40%±2%, 40%±4%, and 46%±
5% for TgNotch3R169C, TgNotch3WT, and Non-Tg mice, respectively
; P = 0.5), indicating that the remaining ionic conductances
likely drive the membrane potential to similar values.
Stromatoxin (20 nM) (33), an inhibitor of K
V
2 channels, did not
significantly constrict PAs from TgNotch3R169Cor Non-Tg mice
(Fig. S1 A and B), further supporting the interpretation that
changes in K
V
1 activity underlie the observed hypersensitivity
of TgNotch3R169C PAs to 4-AP.
The regulation of myogenic tone differs between PAs and
larger pial arteries on the surface of the brain (22, 24). However,
myogenic tone is similarly attenuated in PAs and pial arteries (5)
(Table S1), suggesting a common mechanism. To confirm this, we
applied the pharmacologic approach described above to pressurized

pial arteries from TgNotch3R169C and control (TgNotch3WT and
Non-Tg) mice. Consistent with the findings from PAs, sensitivity to
4-AP (1 mM) was increased in pressurized (60 mmHg) pial arteries
from TgNotch3R169C mice (Fig. S2 Aand B). Furthermore, blocking
BK channels or IK and SK channels, or inhibiting eNOS, had the
same effect in all three genotypes (Fig. 2), and inhibition of K
V
2
channels with stromatoxin (20 nM) constricted pial arteries from
TgNotch3R169C and Non-Tg to the same extent (−14% ± 2%
and−14% ± 3%, respectively; Fig. S1 C and D). Taken together,
these results suggest that K
V
1 channel activity is increased in
both pial arteries and PAs of TgNotch3R169C mice.
K
V
Channel Current Density Is Increased in Cerebral Artery Myocytes
from TgNotch3R169C Mice. An increase in K
V
activity could occur
through a change in channel gating properties, recruitment of new
K
V
channel family members, or an increase in channel number. To
investigate these possibilities, we directly measured K
V
currents in
myocytes freshly isolated from cerebral arteries of TgNotch3R169C
mice, as described in SI Materials and Methods. Currents were
recorded in response to 250-ms voltage steps from −70 mV to
+60 mV (holding potential,−80 mV) in 10-mV increments (Fig. 5A).
Myocytes from TgNotch3R169C, TgNotch3WT, and Non-Tg animals
had similar cell capacitances, indicating a similar membrane
surface area. K
V
current density in myocytes from TgNotch3R169C
mice was significantly greater than that in control cells at all
voltage steps from−30 mV to+60 mV (Fig. 5AandB); at 0 mV,
K
V
current density was∼60% greater in TgNotch3R169Cmyocytes
than in TgNotch3WT myocytes. In contrast, activation time constants
(τ
act
), determined from an exponential fit of individual
voltage-evoked current traces (20-mV increments), were the same
in cerebral myocytes from TgNotch3R169C,TgNotch3 WT,and
Non-Tg mice, suggesting that channel gating was unchanged (Fig.
5C and Table S2). Deactivation time constants (τ
deact
) of the
current decay (“tail currents”) after stepping from a test potential
to−40 mV, obtained by exponential fits, were the same in myocytes
from all three genotypes (Fig. 5D and Table S2). Halfmaximal
activation voltage (V
0.5
) and slope (k), determined by
fitting normalized peak tail currents to the Boltzmann equation,
were similarly indistinguishable among genotypes (Fig. 5E and
Table S2). The absence of a difference in τ
act
, V
0.5
, k,orτ
deact
indicates that the increase in current density in TgNotch3R169C
myocytes is attributable to an increase in the number of channels
rather than a change in their gating properties or subtype composition.
We then compared the effect of 4-AP on the current
density in TgNotch3R169C, TgNotch3 WT, and Non-Tg myocytes.
Consistent with an increase in K
V
1 channel density, 4-AP (1 mM)–
sensitive currents were significantly increased in cerebral SMCs from
TgNotch3R169C myocytes (Fig. S3). Using the Goldman–Hodgkin–
Katz constant field equation and a single-channel conductance of
15 pS (34), we estimated that the average number of functional K
V
channels per myocyte was 4,970 in TgNotch3R169C mice, compared
with 3,275 in TgNotch3WT mice and 3,060 in Non-Tg mice.
Heparin-Binding EGF–Induced Reduction in the Number of Functional
K
V
1 Channels Restores Myogenic Tone in PAs from TgNotch3R169C Mice.
It has previously been reported that K
V
1 channel activity in cerebral
arteries is suppressed by activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase
EGFR with the agonist heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor
(HB-EGF) (35), an effect that reflects enhanced K
V
1 channel
endocytosis (36). To provide further support for the concept that
an increase in K
V
1 channel number in cerebral artery SMCs is responsible
for the impaired myogenic tone in TgNotch3R169C cerebral
microvessels, we tested whether directly reducing the surface
expression of K
V
channels by treatment with HB-EGF restored
myogenic tone in PAs from TgNotch3R169C mice. Consistent with
previous studies in wild-type cerebral arteries, HB-EGF induced a
concentration-dependent vasoconstriction of TgNotch3R169C PAs
(Fig. 6A). Using the relationship between HB-EGF concentration

showing a similar relationship between tone and
membrane potential.

necessary to reach TgNotch3WT levels at 40 mmHg (Fig. 6B). At
this concentration, HB-EGF significantly reduced K
V
current densities
in TgNotch3R169C cerebral myocytes (recorded at +30 mV)
from 24 pA/pF to 19 pA/pF (Fig. 6 C and D), a density not significantly
different from that observed in TgNotch3WT cerebral
myocytes (18 pA/pF; Fig. 5B). Importantly, it also normalized
myogenic tone (Fig. 6E). Collectively, these results confirm that upregulation
of K
V
1 channel number plays a pivotal role in the altered
myogenic phenotype of TgNotch3R169C cerebral arteries/arterioles.
Vascular Function and K
V
Current Densities in Peripheral Resistance
Arteries Are Unaffected by the NOTCH3(R169C) Mutant.NOTCH3 is
expressed by SMCs throughout the vasculature (4), and deposits
of NOTCH3ECD, the pathological hallmark of CADASIL, are
detected in both cerebral and peripheral vessels in patients (37,
38). However, despite this, the clinical manifestations of the disease
are restricted to the central nervous system (3). As a first step
toward identifying differences between the cerebral and peripheral
circulation in CADASIL that might reveal pathological
mechanisms, we compared the effects of the R169C mutation in
the cerebral circulation with those in the systemic circulation, using
third-order branches of mesenteric resistance arteries, which
also express K
V
1andK
V
2 channel family members (31, 39–41).
Immunostaining with an antibody against NOTCH3ECD confirmed
that mesenteric arteries from TgNotch3R169C mice displayed
the characteristic granular accumulation of NOTCH3ECD
at the plasma membrane of SMCs (Fig. S4). However, in contrast
to cerebral arteries, mesenteric arteries from TgNotch3R169Cmice
showed no difference in myogenic response compared with those
from Non-Tg mice (Fig. 7 A and B), and phenylephrine-induced
constriction was also unaltered (Fig. 7 CandD). Moreover, 4-AP
(1 mM and 5 mM) caused a concentration-dependent constriction
of mesenteric arteries that was similar in both genotypes (Fig. 7C
and E). Interestingly, HB-EGF, which effectively suppressed K
V
1
currents in PA myocytes from TgNotch3R169Cmice, did not affect
K
V
current density or promote constriction in mesenteric arteries
from either genotype (Fig. 7 C, F,andG), suggesting that the HBEGF–dependent mechanism of K
V
1 channel regulation does not
operate in mesenteric arteries.

SMCs from cerebral arteries (Table S2). These data, combined
with expression data (31, 39–41) and the functional effects of
4-AP, suggest that the same K
V
channels regulate membrane
potential in cerebral and mesenteric arteries. However, unlike the
case in cerebral arteries, K
V
current density was virtually identical
in mesenteric artery SMCs from Non-Tg and TgNotch3R169C
mice (22 pA/pF at +30 mV; Fig. 7G). Interestingly, K
V
channel
current density in mesenteric myocytes from Non-Tg and
TgNotch3R169C mice was similar to that in cerebral artery myocytes
from TgNotch3R169C mice (24 pA/pF at +30 mV; Fig. 5B).
These results suggest that K
V
channels are already expressed at
elevated levels in SMCs in the peripheral circulation, consistent
with the hypothesized absence of a functional EGFR-mediated
K
V
1 endocytosis mechanism in these peripheral vessels.
Discussion
In this study, we explored the basis of altered brain artery function
in a genetic model of SVD. We found that pressure-induced vasoconstriction
of brain arterioles from a TgNotch3R169C mouse
model of CADASIL is diminished at a very early stage of the
disease (i.e., 6 mo before formation of white matter lesions).
Consistent with this weaker myogenic response, membrane potential
measurements revealed abnormal hyperpolarization in
PAs from these mice. Importantly, we provide to our knowledge
the first insight into the molecular basis of the cerebral artery
dysfunction associated with CADASIL, demonstrating that upregulation
of K
V
1 channel number is responsible for blunted
membrane potential depolarization and diminished myogenic
response at physiological pressures in PAs, as well as pial arteries,
from TgNotch3R169C mice (Fig. 8).
K
V
current density in TgNotch3R169C mice was increased by
∼60% without a change in K
V
kinetics or activation properties,
suggesting that NOTCH3(R169C) expression leads to an increase
in the number of K
V
1 channels in the plasma membrane. Consistent
with this interpretation, functional K
V
1 channel numbers were
estimated to increase by 60% in myocytes from TgNotch3R169C

mice. Moreover, constriction to the preferential K
V
1 channel
blocker, 4-AP, was augmented by NOTCH3(R169C) expression,
with electrophysiology data indicating that the K
V
1.5 subtype is
likely up-regulated. This interpretation is consistent with previous
reports that heteromultimeric K
V
1.2/1.5 channels underlie the effect
of 4-AP on K
V
currents and arterial tone (28–31), and K
V
1.5,
whose current properties most closely match native K
V
currents in
cerebral and mesenteric myocytes (Table S2), is a key player in
myogenic tone regulation (32). In contrast, pharmacological data
and biophysical properties were not consistent with a role for
K
V
2orK
V
7 channels (Table S2). Moreover, vasodilatory influences
of the endothelium (IK/SK, NO) and the BK channeldependent
negative feedback loop were unchanged in both pial
arteries and PAs of TgNotch3R169C mice.
The fact that NOTCH3(R169C) did not affect constriction of
PAs to low intravascular pressure (20 mmHg) or the ability of PAs
to constrict to 60 mM external K+, but greatly reduced constriction
to physiological pressures (40 mmHg) (18) indicates that the
defect emerges in association with increased intravascular pressure
and SMC membrane potential depolarization. The reduced
myogenic tone was not due to a change in the relationship between
membrane potential and myogenic tone. Interestingly, the
greater constriction induced by 4-AP in cerebral arteries/arterioles
from TgNotch3R169C mice eliminated the difference in
myogenic tone, supporting the concept that the abnormal membrane
potential is directly responsible for the difference in tone.
Finally, decreasing K
V
current density in TgNotch3R169Ccerebral
SMCs to the levels measured in TgNotch3WT mice through
HB-EGF–induced K
V
channel endocytosis was sufficient to restore
a WT-like myogenic response in PAs from TgNotch3R169C
mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the elevation in
K
V
channel number resulting from the presence of the R169C mutation
fully accounts for the impaired myogenic response. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of abnormal membrane potential
regulation in CADASIL, specifically, or cerebral SVD generally.
The myogenic response was normal in third-order mesenteric
arteries from TgNotch3R169C mice, and 4-AP–induced constriction
and K
V
channel activity were unchanged in this peripheral
vascular bed, despite expression of the mutated protein and accumulation
of NOTCH3ECD. These observations are consistent
with previous reports that the phenotypic manifestations of
CADASIL are essentially restricted to the cerebral circulation
and reinforce the validity of TgNotch3R169C mice as a preclinical
model of CADASIL. The mechanistic basis of the brain-specific
consequences of NOTCH3(R169C) expression will require
more extensive investigation, but K
V
channel up-regulation is
clearly central to this tissue-restricted phenotype. Although the
NOTCH3 signaling pathway has been reported to regulate K
V
1.5
gene expression (42), it seems unlikely that this mechanism could
account for the cerebrovascular specific manifestations of the
NOTCH3(R169C) mutant because this mutant would be expected
to have a global effect on the vasculature, yet K
V
current
densities were unchanged in mesenteric artery myocytes. More
importantly, HB-EGF completely normalized K
V
current density
and myogenic tone in cerebral arteries, implying that altered

membrane trafficking of K
V
1.5 is capable of fully accounting for
the up-regulation of K
V
channels in TgNotch3R169C mice. The
similar biophysical properties of K
V
channels in cerebral and
peripheral vasculature (Table S2) also argue that differences in
subunit composition are not responsible for the differential
effects of the NOTCH3(R169C) mutant in the two vascular beds,
an argument buttressed by a pharmacological profile consistent
with a K
V
1.2/1.5 channel subtype and literature support for the
expression of K
V
1 family members in both cerebral and mesenteric
arteries (28–31, 39–41). Differences in the caliber of PAs and
mesenteric arteries are also not likely a factor insofar as the
effects of NOTCH3(R169C) expression on pial arteries, which
have an internal diameter similar to that of the third-order mesenteric
arteries used here, were essentially identical to those on
PAs. However, the fact that HB-EGF normalized K
V
current
density and restored myogenic tone in cerebral arteries from
TgNotch3R169C mice, but had no effect on mesenteric arteries
from these mice, suggests a possible mechanistic rationale for the
cerebrovascular-specific effects of CADASIL. According to this
scenario, the peripheral vasculature does not respond to HBEGF
because it lacks the EGFR-mediated pathway that promotes
K
V
channel endocytosis in cerebral arteries. This formulation can
be extended to account for up-regulation of K
V
channels in SMCs
of pial arteries and PAs in TgNotch3R169C mice by postulating
that expression of NOTCH3(R169C) suppresses the EGFR
pathway in these cells, resulting in decreased EGFR-mediated
endocytosis (and thus increased surface expression) of K
V
channels.
In the context of animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH), where this EGFR-mediated endocytosis pathway
was first characterized (35, 36), K
V
channels are down-regulated
due to increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated cleavage
of pro–HB-EGF and enhanced shedding of HB-EGF. Interestingly
, Joutel and coworkers recently reported (43) increased
levels and activity of the MMP inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) in the characteristic NOTCH3ECD
aggregates that accumulate around small cerebral vessels in
CADASIL patients and TgNotch3R169C mice early in the progression
of the disease, a finding that would be consistent with diminished
HB-EGF shedding and the postulated suppression of
EGFR-mediated K
V
channel endocytosis. Indeed, TIMP3 specifically
inhibits ADAM17 (44), also known as TNFα-converting enzyme
(TACE), which is involved in the shedding of several EGFR
ligands, including HB-EGF (45, 46).
The defect in myogenic tone appears in both pial arteries and
parenchymal arterioles of TgNotch3R169Cmice, but the pathological
issues that present with SVD in patients occur preferentially in

arterioles within the brain (1, 9). Although it is difficult to predict
the consequences of an“early”defect in myogenic tone in PAs, the
intraparenchymal circulation clearly constitutes a unique vascular
bed with specific features—shared by human and rodent brains
(47, 48)—that might contribute to later manifestations of SVD.
Notable in this context, the limited collateral blood supply between
PAs creates a “bottleneck” effect (7) that segregates perfused
territories and therefore worsens the impact of PA lesions on
nervous tissue (8, 9). Moreover, because PAs are the last vessels
upstream of the capillary bed, the decreased resistance created by
the reduction in myogenic tone would ultimately hamper the ability
of PAs to protect capillaries from disruptive effects of acute elevations
of arterial pressure. Our observations may also help account
for other aspects of the CADASIL phenotype observed in
the TgNotch3R169C mouse model (5). For example, the less constricted
basal state of PAs in this model implies a diminution in
the vasodilatory reserve, potentially decreasing NVC efficiency.
A substantial part of this hemodynamic response is mechanistically
linked to PA dilation (13), which is preconditioned by the resting
tone of the vessel (49, 50). Thus, the diminished myogenic responsiveness
of the cerebral microvasculature of TgNotch3R169C
mice—a direct consequence of K
V
1 channel up-regulation—would
be expected to impair NVC. This is in fact the case (5).
Our results support the concept that the level of myogenic
tone depends on surface expression of the K
V
channel—a major
negative feedback element that controls vascular smooth muscle
membrane potential. The fact that altered surface membrane
expression of K
V
channels in cerebral arteries is the key feature
underlying disparate pathologies—CADASIL (present study)
and SAH (35, 36)—suggests a high degree of plasticity in K
V
channel regulatory mechanisms. In both pathologies, a change in
the gain of the K
V
1-mediated negative feedback circuit would be
expected to affect CBF and the responses of arteries to pressure
fluctuations. Importantly, because no other features of smooth
muscle or endothelial cells appeared to be altered in the
TgNotch3R169C mouse model of SVD, our findings suggest that upregulation
of K
V
1 channels is directly responsible for the observed
cerebrovascular dysfunction. Others have previously reported
channelopathies in which the identified channel mutation altered
cell surface expression without affecting the intrinsic properties of
the channel (51). Our current results, taken together with these
previous observations, argue that the concept of channelopathy
should be broadened to include mutations in nonchannel proteins
that produce pathologies by altering the number of functional
channels without affecting their intrinsic properties. Our findings
further suggest that the K
V
1 channel and the pathways that regulate
its surface expression are potential therapeutic targets in SVD.
Materials and Methods
Animal Model. The Tg mouse lines, TgNotch3WT and TgNotch3R169C, have
been previously described (5). Non-Tg mice are nontransgenic littermates
obtained during breeding of TgNotch3WT and TgNotch3R169C mice and were
used as wild-type mice. Six-month-old animals were euthanized by i.p. injection
of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) followed by rapid decapitation.
We focused on mice at this age because this is well in advance (6 mo) of the
development of significant white matter lesion burden and for comparison
with our previous study (5, 6). TgNotch3WT and TgNotch3R169C mice (on an
FVB/N background) overexpress rat wild-type NOTCH3 and the CADASIL-
causing NOTCH3(R169C) mutant protein, respectively, to a similar degree
(approximately fourfold) compared with the levels of endogenous NOTCH3
in Non-Tg mice (5). Expression of CADASIL-causing mutations at normal endogenous
levels does not produce a CADASIL-like phenotype, likely because the
slowly developing mutant phenotype is unable to manifest during the short
lifespan of a mouse (52). Overexpression of the mutant protein overcomes this
constraint and is thus a key feature of this model. All experimental protocols
used in this study were in accord with institutional guidelines approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Vermont.
Diameter Measurements. Precapillary segments of PAs that arise from the
middle cerebral artery M1 region and perfuse the neocortex, PCAs, and thirdorder
mesenteric arteries (∼100μm internal diameter) were dissected free of
surrounding tissue, cannulated on glass micropipettes (with one end occluded
for PAs) in an organ chamber (University of Vermont Instrumentation
and Model Facility), and pressurized using an arteriograph system (Living
Systems Instrumentation). Vessel internal diameter was continuously monitored
using a CCD camera and edge-detection software (IonOptix). Drugs
were applied by addition to the superfusate.
Arteriolar Smooth Muscle Membrane Potential Recordings.PAs were pressurized
as described above. Membrane potential was recorded in myocytes, using glass
microelectrodes filled with 0.5 M KCl (tip resistance, 150–250 MΩ)(19).
SMC Isolation and Perforated Patch-Clamp Experiments. Single SMCs were
isolated from cerebral arteries (anterior, middle, and posterior) and third-order
mesenteric arteries by enzymatic digestion followed by gentle trituration.
Outward K+currents were recorded from single cells, using the perforated-cell
configuration of the patch-clamp technique, in the presence of 1μMpaxilline
to block BK currents. The relationship between myocyte membrane voltage
and the amplitudes of the tail currents (I) was fitted to a Boltzmann equation,
I=
Imax

,
where I

is the measured peak tail current, to allow determination of the

The significance of differences between two means was determined using
Student’sttest. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by one-way analysis of
