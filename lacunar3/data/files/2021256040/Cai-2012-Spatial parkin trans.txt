Summary
Mitochondria are essential for neuronal survival and function.
Proper degradation of aged and damaged mitochondria
through mitophagy is a key cellular pathway for mitochondrial
quality control. Recent studies have indicated that
PINK1/Parkin-mediated pathways ensure mitochondrial
integrity and function [1–8]. Translocation of Parkin to
damaged mitochondria induces mitophagy in many nonneuronal
cell types [9–16]. However, evidence showing
Parkin translocation in primary neurons is controversial
[9, 15, 17, 18], leaving unanswered questions as to how
and where Parkin-mediated mitophagy occurs in neurons.
Here, we report the unique process of dissipating mitochondrial Dc
m
-induced and Parkin-mediated mitophagy in
mature cortical neurons. Compared with nonneuronal cells,
neuronal mitophagy is a much slower and compartmentally
restricted process, coupled with reduced anterograde
mitochondrial transport. Parkin-targeted mitochondria are
accumulated in the somatodendritic regions where mature
lysosomes are predominantly located. Time-lapse imaging
shows dynamic formation and elimination of Parkin- and
LC3-ring-like structures surrounding depolarized mitochondria
through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the soma.
Knocking down Parkin in neurons impairs the elimination
of dysfunctional mitochondria. Thus, our study provides
neuronal evidence for dynamic and spatial Parkin-mediated
mitophagy, which will help us understand whether altered
mitophagy contributes to pathogenesis of several major
neurodegenerative diseases characterized by mitochondrial
dysfunction and impaired transport.
Results and Discussion
Mitochondrial Depolarization Induces Slower Parkin
Translocation in Mature Neurons
To examine whether mitochondrial depolarization induces
Parkin translocation in neurons, we performed three lines of
experiments. First, we treated mouse cortical neurons expressing
YFP-Parkin and Discosoma species red fluorescent
protein (dsRed)-Mito at 9–10 days in vitro (DIV) for 24 hr with
vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control, 10 mM
carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP; a Dc
m
dissipating reagent), or 10mM CCCP with lysosomal inhibitors
(LIs; 10mM pepstatin A and 10mM E64D). Although YFP-Parkin
was diffuse in the cytosol of DMSO-treated control neurons
(n = 435), it redistributed to mitochondria in 26.67%6 4.46%
of neurons (n = 420) treated with CCCP and in 55.87% 6
6.57% of neurons treated with CCCP/LIs (n = 570) (Figures
1A and 1B). Treatment with CCCP/LIs doubled the percentage
of neurons with Parkin translocation relative to CCCP alone
(p < 0.001), suggesting that lysosomal degradation capacity
has a significant impact on the clearance of Parkin-targeted
mitochondria via mitophagy in neurons. Second, we coimmunostained
similarly treated neurons with antibodies against
neuronal marker MAP2 and mitochondrial markers TOM20
(an outer membrane protein) or cytochromec(a dynamic intermembrane
space protein). YFP-Parkin was recruited to mitochondria
labeled with TOM20 or cytochrome c (Figure 1C) in
CCCP-treated neurons, but not in DMSO controls. To examine
Parkin translocation kinetics, we imaged neurons at various
time points during CCCP treatment. Parkin translocation
between 0.5–6 hr was exceptionally rare. Parkin-ring-like
structures surrounding fragmented mitochondria were occasionally
observed at as early as 12 hr and became increasingly
frequent after 18 hr of CCCP treatment (Figure 1D).
To determine whether endogenous Parkin undergoes
similar translocation after depolarization, we immunostained
cortical neurons at DIV10 with an anti-Parkin antibody
following 24 hr CCCP/LIs treatment. Whereas endogenous
Parkin appears as a diffuse pattern or as small puncta not
colocalized with mitochondria in DMSO-treated neurons,
treatment with CCCP/LIs induces endogenous Parkin recruitment
to mitochondria (Figure 1E). Alternatively, we isolated
the mitochondria-enriched membrane fraction from cultured
cortical neurons at DIV13 following the same treatment.
Although the majority of Parkin was in the cytosolic fraction,
treatment with CCCP/LIs induced endogenous Parkin to
associate with the mitochondria-enriched membrane (Figure
1F). Quantitative analysis showed a 2-fold (2.28 6 0.31)
increase in Parkin intensity in the mitochondrial fractions
following treatment with CCCP/LIs compared with DMSO
(p = 0.0014, n = 3). We also observed elevated levels of the autophagic
markers LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 associated with the
mitochondria-enriched membrane fraction. Altogether, these
results indicate that mitochondrial depolarization can induce
the recruitment of both exogenous and endogenous Parkin
in mature neurons.
A gradual but slow increase in Parkin translocation during
prolonged CCCP treatment argues against the possibility
that CCCP becomes less effective over time in medium.
Spiked CCCP media, which had been incubated with neurons
for 24 hr, were still effective and sufficient to induce 23.95%6
2.49% of cultured neurons (fresh) to display Parkin translocation
, a percentage close to that when using fresh CCCP
(26.67%6 4.46%) at the same concentration (see Figure S1
available online). These results suggest that Parkin-mediated
mitophagy in neurons is a much slower process than in
other cell types reported. Treating HeLa cells with 10 mM

association with mitochondria inw80% of cells within 1–2 hr
[9–11, 17].
Parkin Is Selectively Recruited to Depolarized
Mitochondria
To examine whether Parkin-targeted mitochondria display
dissipated Dc
m
, we pulsed live neurons expressing YFPParkin
and CFP-Mito with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
(TMRE), aDc
m
-dependent dye. Active or healthy mitochondria
will accumulate TMRE to have higher TMRE intensity. In
DMSO-treated neurons or neurons recovered from CCCP
treatment (no Parkin translocation), the majority of CFPMito-labeled
mitochondria were colabeled by TMRE, reflecting
their electrochemically active status (Figure 2A). In
contrast, somatic mitochondria with YFP-Parkin translocation
displayed reduced or no TMRE staining, suggesting that
YFP-Parkin is selectively recruited to depolarized mitochondria
(Figures 2A and 2B). We quantified the TMRE mean intensity
in somas and normalized to that in DMSO control neurons
(Figure 2C). Neurons with Parkin translocation exhibited a
48.3% 6 4.7% (n = 17; p < 0.001) reduction in the TMRE
mean intensity relative to recovered neurons (95.9%6 5.3%
n = 16) and DMSO-treated controls (n = 16). Time-lapse
TMRE imaging in live cortical neurons demonstrates that acute
incubation with 10 mM CCCP during an 11 min recording is
sufficient to globally depolarize Dc
m
(Figure S2B). Furthermore
, Parkin was gradually recruited to mitochondria in the
soma during a 52 min recording time (Figure 2D; Movie S1).
To determine whether endogenous Parkin is critical for
eliminating mitochondria with dissipatedDc
m
, we suppressed
Parkin expression using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach.
Cortical neurons were transfected with Parkin small interfering
RNA (siRNA) or control siRNA at DIV0 and endogenous
Parkin levels were then assessed by immunoblot. ParkinsiRNA
specifically and efficiently reduced endogenous Parkin
expression to 26.10%6 7.96% (n = 3) of control levels (Figure
2E). Knocking down Parkin impaired the elimination of
dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to accumulation of mitochondria
with reduced TMRE intensity (Figures 2F and 2G).
After 24 hr CCCP treatment, 66.91% 6 2.00% of control
neurons (n = 130) recovered mitochondrial TMRE intensity,
versus 19.27%6 2.01% (n = 97, p < 0.001) of Parkin loss-offunction
neurons (Figure 2G). These results support our
hypothesis that Parkin-mediated mitophagy is one of the
unique neuronal mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial integrity
and function in response to dissipating Dc
m
. Our RNAi
data are consistent with a previous report demonstrating
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in Parkindeficient
mice [2].
Previous reports noted an absence of Parkin translocation
after acute CCCP treatment of primary cortical neurons [15]

and in dopaminergic neurons with the loss of mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) [18]. The latter study suggests two different
neuronal responses to damaged mitochondria: one for acute
Dc
m
dissipation by depolarizing reagents and one for slow
progressive deterioration of mitochondrial function by deleting
mtDNA in vivo. Thus, Parkin-mediated mitophagy likely serves
to ensure neuronal mitochondrial integrity by eliminating
severely damaged mitochondria with lostDc
m
[18]. Our study
reveals that neuronal mitophagy is a slower process. In
response to 24 hr CCCP treatment, only a small percentage
of neurons displayed detectable Parkin translocation, whereas
mitochondria in the majority of neurons recover Dc
m
. In 
addition, the efficacy of Parkin-mediated mitophagic flux in
neurons is controlled by lysosomal degradation capacity. It
is unclear how neurons recover theirDc
m
following prolonged
CCCP treatment in culture. Unlike most cells, neurons are
wholly dependent upon mitochondrial respiration, thus special
mechanisms are required to recover damaged mitochondria
after global depolarization. We propose that lysosomal function
, proper Parkin expression, slow Parkin translocation,
and the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria are important
factors for Dc
m recovery. In addition, the quality of the
neuronal culture is critical to create optimal survival conditions
following CCCP treatment; if not met, the uncoupled mitochondria
may quickly initiate an apoptotic process before
Parkin translocation can be observed. We have established
a high neuronal culture quality to meet our live neuron imaging
standards with minimal enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, and
oxidative damage [19, 20] (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
Parkin-Targeted Mitochondria Accumulate in the
Somatodendritic Regions
We examined the distribution of Parkin-targeted mitochondria
in neurons treated with CCCP/LIs. Translocated YFP-Parkin
forms typical ring-like structures surrounding fragmented
mitochondria, which predominantly accumulate in the soma
and proximal dendritic regions but are hardly detectable in
axons and the distal dendritic processes (Figure 3A), suggesting
that depolarized mitochondria are selectively accumulated
in the somatodendritic regions after prolonged CCCP treatment.
Such unique compartmental restriction was consistently
observed in neurons treated with a second Dc
m dissipating
reagent antimycin A (1mM) or the selective ATP synthase inhibitor
oligomycin (1mM) (Figures S2C, S2D, and S3).
This unique distribution pattern suggests that depolarized
mitochondria undergo altered transport following prolonged
CCCP treatment. To test this possibility, we examined relative
mitochondrial mobility following 24 hr CCCP treatment. We
selected axons for measuring mitochondrial mobility due to
their uniform microtubule organization and polarity. Axonal
processes were selected as we previously reported [19, 20]
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Kymographs were
used to quantify relative mobility. In DMSO-treated neurons,
42.7% 6 2.3% (mean 6 SEM) of axonal mitochondria are
stationary and 57% of mitochondria are mobile, where
35.9% 6 2% undergo anterograde transport and 21.3% 6
2% undergo retrograde transport. In contrast, in neurons
with Parkin translocation, anterograde transport was reduced
to 13.3%62% (p < 0.001), whereas retrograde transport was
relatively increased (36.12%6 3.67%, p = 0.002), accompanied
by reduced velocity and altered flux of axonal mitochondria
(Figures 3B–3D). In recovered neurons without Parkin
translocation after CCCP treatment, mobility parameters
were similar or slightly changed compared to those in
DMSO-treated neurons.
Altered mitochondrial mobility may be protective for neurons
under stressful conditions, where healthy mitochondria
remain distally, whereas damaged mitochondria return to the
soma for degradation. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed
syntaphilin (SNPH), a neuronal mitochondria docking
protein that anchors mitochondria to microtubules, to artificially
immobilize mitochondria in distal processes [19]. To
our surprise, the distribution of Parkin-targeted mitochondria
in neurons changed strikingly following CCCP treatment;
Parkin was recruited to arrested mitochondria in distal neuronal
processes (Figure 3E). This artificial phenotype suggests
that once distal mitochondria are immobilized, they will eventually
recruit Parkin. Thus, somatodendritic accumulation of
Parkin-targeted mitochondria may be coordinately attributed
to several factors including (1) reduced anterograde and
relatively enhanced retrograde transport leading to more depolarized
mitochondria accumulated in the somatodendritic
regions during prolonged CCCP treatment and (2) immobilization
of mitochondria after slow Parkin translocation, resulting
in reduced anterograde flux of damaged mitochondria
into distal processes (Figures 3C and 3D). Therefore, a
Parkin-mediated process prevents dysfunctional mitochondria
from traveling peripherally. Consistently, we observed
that Parkin-targeted mitochondria in the soma remain
stationary throughout time-lapse recording. This hypothesis
is consistent with previous studies showing reduced levels
of motor and adaptor proteins upon CCCP-induced mitophagy
[12, 13] and a recent report showing that Parkin-dependent
degradation of Miro arrests mitochondrial movement [21].
The correlation between Dc
m
and mitochondrial mobility is
controversial, especially following acute treatment of neurons
with high concentrations ofDc
m
dissipating reagents [22, 23].
In one study with JC-1 staining and acute depolarization with
much higher concentrations of antimycin A (100 mM), 90% of
mitochondria with high Dc
m
moved in the anterograde direction
, whereas 80% with low Dc
m
moved in the retrograde
direction [22]. Interestingly, acutely applying a much higher
concentration of CCCP (1mM) blocks mitochondrial transport.
Another study with TMRM staining showed no correlation
between Dc
m
and the direction of axonal mitochondrial
transport in sensory neurons [23]. In our study, we instead
examined mitochondrial mobility after neuron recovery from
24 hr treatment with a lower concentration of CCCP (10 mM),
allowing us to assess the correlation between mobility and
slow Parkin translocation. Prolonged Dc
m
dissipation may
allow the proceeding slow events to induce mobility changes
in neurons, which is supported by our observations that
only neurons with Parkin translocation displayed reduced
anterograde movement.
Parkin-Targeted Mitochondria Are Eliminated through
the Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway in Somas
To determine whether Parkin-targeted mitochondria are
degraded via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, we labeled
autophagic vacuoles with GFP-LC3 [20]. In DMSO-treated
conditions, GFP-LC3 was cytosolic (Figure 4A). However,
CCCP treatment resulted in LC3-labeled ring-like structures
surrounding fragmented mitochondria in the somatodendritic
regions. Treating neurons with both CCCP and LIs produced
more LC3-labeled mitochondria (yellow) and other autophagic
vacuoles (green). These imaging results are consistent with our
biochemical observations showing elevated LC3-II and p62

levels in the mitochondria-enriched fraction following depolarization
(Figure 1F). To determine whether depolarized mitochondria
were retained within lysosomal organelles upon
lysosomal inhibition, we expressed GFP-LAMP1, a lysosomal
membrane protein. In DMSO-treated neurons, there was little
colocalization (2.72% 6 0.31%) between mitochondria and
lysosomes (Figure 4B). In contrast, treatment with CCCP/LIs
significantly enhanced the recruitment of mitochondria to

LAMP1-labeled lysosomes in the soma (32.10% 6 2.17%,
p < 0.001). This indicates that proper lysosomal function is
required to efficiently eliminate damaged mitochondria.
We next examined Parkin and LC3-labled mitochondrial
dynamics in the somatodendritic regions (Figure 4C). During
a 25 min time-lapse recording of the soma, ring-like vesicular
structures colabeled with GFP-LC3 and mCherry-Parkin
disappeared, whereas new puncta emerged. Furthermore,
a ring-like Parkin-associated mitochondrion, as opposed to
the Parkin-negative mitochondria in the same image, disappeared
over a 38 min time-lapse recording period (Figure 4D;
Movie S2). Both the Parkin-ring structure and the mitochondrion
were eliminated, whereas the Parkin-unlabeled mitochondrion
remained. Thus, our study provides live neuronal
evidence showing degradation of Parkin-targeted mitochondria
through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway.
Although somatodendritic Parkin-mediated mitophagy is
readily and consistently detected in our cultures, it was hardly
detectable along distal axonal processes. Alternatively, GFPLC3
in cortical neurons was recruited to axonal mitochondria
following 24 hr treatment with CCCP/LIs (Figure S4). Thus,
axonal mitochondria may undergo either Parkin-mediated mitophagy
at undetectable Parkin signals or Parkin-independent
mitophagy. Further investigation is required to determine the
main mechanism for axonal mitochondrial quality control.
Dysfunctional mitochondria not only produce energy less
efficiently, but also release harmful reactive oxygen species
and initiate apoptotic signaling cascades, all linked to the
pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative disorders [24–28].
Sequestration and elimination of aged and damaged mitochondria
is an important but poorly characterized neuronal
mechanism. In the current study, we reveal several unique
features of Parkin-mediated mitophagy in mature cortical
neurons. First, Parkin translocation onto mitochondria is
slower than in nonneuronal cells. Second, Parkin is selectively
recruited to depolarized mitochondria to form ring-like
structures. Third, following 24 hr CCCP incubation, Parkin
translocation only occurs in a small percentage of neurons.
Lysosomal degradation is critical for the efficacy of Parkinmediated
mitophagy. Fourth, Parkin translocation is restricted
to the somatodendritic regions, where mature and acidic
lysosomes are predominantly localized [20, 29, 30]. This
spatial and dynamic process allows neurons to efficiently
eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. Therefore, our study,
for the first time, shows selective and dynamic Parkin translocation
to depolarized mitochondria and subsequent degradation
via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in live neurons.
