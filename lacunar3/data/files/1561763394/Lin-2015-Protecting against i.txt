ABSTRACT
Background Exercise preconditioning (EP+) has been widely accepted as a being of safe and effective preventive
measure for stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether EP+ improves outcomes of
ischaemic stroke by promoting neuronal and glial expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 20.
Materials and methods Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (288 in number) were used to investigate the contribution
of HSP20-containing neurons and HSP20-containing glial cells in the exercise-mediated neuroprotection
in the stroke condition using middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Results Exercise preconditioning, in addition to increasing the numbers of both the HSP20-containg neurons
(88  8 vs. 43  4; n = 8 each group; P < 005) and the HSP20-containg astrocytes (102  10 vs. 56  5;
n = 8; P < 005) significantly attenuated stroke-induced brain infarct (140  9 vs. 341  20 mm3; n = 8 per
group; P < 001), neuronal apoptosis (20  5 vs. 87  7; n = 8 per group; n = 8; P < 001), glial apoptosis
(29  5 vs. 101  4; n = 8; P < 001), and neurological deficits (66  03 vs. 117  08; n = 8 per group;
P < 001). Reducing the numbers of both HSP20-containing neurons and HSP20-contaiing glia by intracerebral
injection of pSUPER small interfering RNAί expressing HSP20 significantly reversed the beneficial effects of
EP+ in attenuating stroke-induced cerebral infarct, neuronal and glial apoptosis, and neurological deficits.
Conclusions The numbers of both the HSP20-containing neurons and the HSP20-containing glia inversely
correlated with the outcomes of ischaemic stroke. In addition, preischaemic treadmill exercise improves outcomes
of ischaemic stroke by increasing the numbers of both the HSP20-containing neurons and the HSP20-
containing glia.

Introduction
According to the guidelines for the primary prevention of
stroke published by the American Heart Association/American
Stroke Association, finding out an effective prevention of stroke
is particularly important [1]. Exercise preconditioning (EP+) has
been widely accepted as a kind of safe and effective preventive
measure for stroke. In particular, it has been promoted that EP+
may provide protection for people who undergo a transient
ischaemia attack are highly likely to experience a subsequent
ischaemic stroke [2]. Preischaemic EP+ has been shown to be
effective in improving behavioural and neuropathological
indices after cerebral ischaemia [3]. However, the exact
neuroprotective mechanism of preischaemic EP+ against
ischaemic stroke injury has not been elucidated clearly.
A recent study has shown that EP+ reduces neuronal apoptosis
in ischaemic stroke by up-regulating heat shock protein
(HSP) 72 and extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/
2) in rats [4]. The small HSP 20, also referred to as P20/HSP B6,
is expressed in the brain, stomach, liver, lung, kidney, blood,
smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue [5].
Increased HSP 20 expression in the heart has been shown to
protect against ischaemic heart injury [6]. However, whether
EP+ increases HSP 20 expression in brain and whether
appearance of brain HSP 20 prior to ischaemic stroke plays a
role in the exercise-based neuroprotection remains unknown.
To better understand EP+-based neuroprotection, the present
study first elucidates whether neuronal and glial expression of 1C.-M. Lin and C.-K. Chang contributed equally to this study.

HSP 20 can be up-regulated by preischaemic EP+ in rats. Secondly
, it describes the contributions of EP+-mediated neuronal
and glial overexpression of HSP 20 to functional recovery and
neuronal and glial survival in an ischaemic stroke model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats.
Methods
Animals and stroke model
Two hundred and eighty-eight adult male Sprague–Dawley
rats (weight, 251  11 g) were housed under controlled environmental
conditions with ambient temperature of 22  1 °C,
relative humidity of 65% and 12-h light/dark cycle, with free
access to food and water. Brain focal ischaemia was induced by
MCAO in rats by intraluminal filaments, using the relatively
noninvasive technique detailed previously [7,8]. The protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Animal
Care and Use (Assurance Number: 100120751).
Recombinant pSUPER plasmid expressing HSP 20
siRNA construction
pSUPER vector (Oligo Engine, Seattle, WA, USA), which contains
polymerase-III H1-RNA gene promoter, can direct the
synthesis of siRNA-like transcripts. The target sequence for
HSP 20 (Gen Bank Accession No. NM-0319712) was chemically
synthesized (Tri-1 Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) as complementary
olgonucleotides [9]. ABLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi) search of the human genome database was done to
ensure that the sequence did not target other gene transcripts.
The synthetic oligonucleotide HSP 20:

was annealed and cloned downstream of H1 promoter to
construct recombinant pSUPER plasmid expressing HSP 20
small interfering RNA (siRNA-HSP 20). The cloned HSP 20
target sequence was sequence-confirmed using a DNA
sequencer (ABI Prism 377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA).
During MCAO surgery, an acute dose of siRNA-HSP 20
(5 lg/rat) in 5 lL of pSUPER small interfering RNAί delivery
media (siRNA-vector) was injected into the injured cerebral
cortex at 05 lL/min using a microinfusion pump (type ESP-32;
Eicom Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a 10-lL microsyringe
(Hamilton Company, Tokyo, Japan). After the infusion was
complete, the cannula was left in place for 5 min and then
removed at 1 mm/min. A single 28 gauge stainless steel injection
cannula (Eicom, Kyoto, Japan) was lowered into the right
cerebral cortex (coordinates; 12 mm anterior to bregma, 46mm
lateral to midline and 30 mm ventral to the skull surface) [10].
Exercise training protocol
Animals were trained on a treadmill 5 days a week for 3 weeks.
Initially, animals were acclimatized to run for 15 min at 20 m/
min, 0% slop for 3 days. Then, the animals were running for
30 min at 20 m/min, 30 min at 30 m/min and 60 min at 30 m/
min after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of training, respectively. Not-exercise
preconditioned controls (EP) were placed daily on a stationary
treadmill and were given electrical stimulation in a
manner identical with that used for the EP+ group.
Experimental groups and procedures
The rats were randomly assigned to one of eight groups (n = 8
for each group): (i) (EP + MCAO) group, (ii)
(EP+ + MCAO) group, (iii) (EP + MCAO+) group, (iv)
(EP+ + MCAO+) group, (v) EP+ + intracerebral injection of
siRNA-vector + MCAO+ (EP+ + siRNA-vector+ + MCAO+),
(vi) EP+ + intracerebral injection of siRNA-HSP 20 + MCAO+
(EP+ + siRNA-HSP 20+ + MCAO+), (vii) EP + MCAO + siR
NA-20 and (viii) EP + MCAO + siRNA-vector.
In Experiment 1, the optical density values of cerebral HSP 20
were determined 3 days after the MCAO or sham operation in
all groups. RNAί was also used for non MCAO group rats.
In Experiment 2, the neurological severity score (NSS) values
for all groups were determined 1 day before, and 3 days after
the MCAO or sham operation.
In Experiment 3, the infarction volumes of cerebral cortex in
all groups were determined 3 days after the MCAO or sham
operation.
In Experiment 4, immunofluorescence staining was used to
count the numbers of colocalization of NeuN-TUNEL-HSP 20
or GFAP-TUNEL-HSP 20 specific marker cells in the
ipsilateral cerebral cortex 3 days after MCAO or sham
operation.
In Experiment 5, immunofluorescence staining was used to
count the numbers of colocalizations of NeuN-HSP 20-DAPI or
GFAP-HSP 20-DAPI specific marker cells in the ipsilateral
cerebral cortex 3 days after MCAO or sham operation.

NSS and motor function test
Acute neurological injury was assessed in all rats the day before
and 7 days after surgery using a NSS, a composite of the motor,
sensory, and reflex test scores [11]. The inclined plane was used
to measure limb strength as detailed previously [12].
Cerebral infarction assessment
Rats were with deep anaesthesia and were transcardially perfused
with heparinized 005 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) followed by ice-cold 15% sucrose in PBS. The brains were
rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then sectioned
for immunohistochemistry [7,8]. Brain slices were
stained by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as detailed
previously [13]. The infarct volume (mm3), as revealed by
negative TTC stains indicating dehydrogenase-deficience tissue
, was measured in each slice and summed using computerized
planimetry [14]. We also made correction of the
distortion of infarct volume caused by brain oedema in reference
to the report of Lin et al. [15].
Protein analysis and quantification
Western blotting of the brain tissue samples was done 3 days
after MCAO. Samples were sonicated and spun at 14 k for
30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at
80 °C for Western blotting. The samples were boiled in standard
Laemmli sample buffer for 2 min. Equal amounts of total
protein were dissolved in 10% SDS–PAGE gels and transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Each nitrocellulose replica was incubated with primary
antibody and then incubated with the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody.
Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP 20 (1 : 1000) (Cell Signaling
, Beverly, MA, USA) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were used to detect corresponding proteins on the same

membrane. AS a final step, membranes were probed with
mouse monoclonal anto-actin antibody (1 : 5000) (AC15;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to confirm comparable
protein loading for each lane. Immunoreactive bands were
detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The optical densities of
immunopositive bands were determined (Gene Tools analysis
software; Syngene Europe, Cambridge, UK), and values for
each ample were normalized to actin.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated and
dUTP-biotin nick end-labelling (TUNEL) staining and
immunostaining
Seven days after MCAO, rat brains were prepared as
described above. Serial 10-lm coronal sections were selected
and used for TUNEL-staining with a TUNEL reaction mixture
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For double labelling,
antibodies (1 : 200) specific to neurons (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA), astrocytes (Abcam), and HSP 20 (Abcam) were
used. Nuclei were labelled with DAPI (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA). Sections were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies in PBS containing 05% normal bovine
serum at 4 °C; secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h
at room temperature. The antibodies were, sequentially,
mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (1 : 200) (Abcam), mouse
monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody
(1 : 200) (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP 20 antibody
(1 : 200) (C-Term), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse IgG antibody (1 : 400) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), and DyLight 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG
antibody (1 : 400) (Abcam). The sections were cover-slipped
with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark
). The labelled cells were calculated in five coronal sections
from each rat and expressed as the mean number of
cells per section. Serial sections were also stained (1 : 200)
with mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN neuron-specific antibody
(Abcam) for histological analysis.
Statistical analysis
Data are means  SD. Statistical analysis was done using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher’s post hoc
test. Analyses for behavioural variables used Student’s
unpaired t test to compare variables between groups.
Bonferroni analysis was then used when appropriate to
determine post hoc significance at individual time points.
Statistica 120 (StatSoft Holdings, Inc. Taiwan Branch, New
Taipei City, Taiwan) was used to analyse all data.
Significance was set at P < 005.
Results
Cerebral HSP 20 was higher in EP+ rats
Western blotting revealed that cerebral HSP 20 levels of
(EP+ + MCAO-) group rats were significantly higher than those
of (EP- + MCAO-) group rats (P < 005; 175  19% vs.
100  11%). Again, in the (EP+ + MCAO+) group rats, cerebral
levels of HSP 20 were significantly higher than those for
(EP- + MCAO+) group rats (186  12% vs. 125  9%, P < 001,

Fig. 1a, B vs. A). Compared to those of (EP+ + MCAO+) group
rats, (EP+ + MCAO+ + siRNA-HSP 20) group rats, but not
(EP+ + MCAO+ + siRNA-vector) group rats, had significantly
lower levels of cerebral HSP 20 than did (EP+ + MCAO+) group
rats (P < 005, 95  8% vs. 175  19%, C vs. B, Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b
demonstrated that the cerebral levels of HSP 20 in the
EP + MCAO group were significantly decreased by siRNAHSP
20 (P < 005, 46  5% vs. 100  4% C vs. A), but not by
siRNA-vector (P > 005, 100  4% vs. 100  5%, B vs. A). It
should be stated that the siRNA-vector apparently did not
reduce HSP20 compared to the control.
Functional recovery after MCAO
Both (EP + MCAO) and (EP+ + MCAO) group rats displayed
normal neurological motor function evidenced with ‘0’
mNSS and 55°maximal angles. (EP+ + MCAO+) group rats had
significantly (P < 001) lesser neurological severity scores
(66  03% vs. 117  08%; Fig. 2a, B vs. A) but higher maximal
degrees (48  1ovs. 39  1o; Fig. 2b, B vs. A) than did EP
controls. The beneficial effects of EP+in promoting neurological
motor recovery following MCAO were significantly reversed
by siRNA-HSP 20 (P < 005) (Fig. 2a, C vs. B and b, C vs. B), but
not by siRNA-vector (P > 005) (Fig. 2a, D vs. B and b, D vs. B).
Cerebral infarction after MCAO
The cerebral infarct volumes for both (EP + MCAO) and
(EP+ + MCAO) group rats were negligible. Rats in the
(EP+ + MCAO+) group had significantly less infarction than did
the rats in the (EP + MCAO+) group (140  9 vs.
341  20 mm3,P < 001 for B vs. A) (Fig. 3). Rats in
(EP+ + siRNA-HSP 20 + MCAO+) group had significantly more
cerebral infarction than did rats in the (EP+ + MCAO+) group
(420  18 vs. 141  9mm 3,P < 001 for C vs. B) (Fig. 3). However
, infarct volumes of (EP+ + MCAO+ + siRNA-vector)
groups were not significant from those of(EP+ + MCAO+) group
rats (Fig. 3, D vs. B) (152  16 vs. 141  9mm 3,P > 005).

rats were negligible. Neuronal and astroglial apoptosis were
verified using (NeuN + TUNEL + HSP20) (Fig. 4a) and
(GFAP + TUNEL + HSP20) (Fig. 4b) triple stains, respectively,
3 days post-MCAO. The numbers of apoptotic neurons (20  5
vs. 87  7,P < 001; Fig. 4a, B vs. A) and apoptotic glia (29  5
vs. 101  4,P < 001; Fig. 4b, B vs. A) were significantly lower in
the EP+ + MCAO+group than those in the EP + MCAO+
group. Rats in EP+ + siRNA-HSP 20 + MCAO group had significantly
higher apoptotic neurons (92  11 vs. 22  5,
P < 001; Fig. 4a, C vs. B) and higher apoptotic glia (120  9 vs.
21  5,P < 001; Fig. 4b, C vs. B) than did EP+ + siRNA-
vector + MCAO+group rats or EP+ + MCAO+group, rats
(P < 001).
Post-MCAO increased numbers of both HSP-20
containing neurons and HSP20-containing glial cells
in ipsilateral frontal cortex were significantly higher
in the EP+ group rats
The numbers of NeuN + SP20 + DAPI specific stained cells for
(EP + MCAO) and (EP+ + MCAO) group rats were 43  4
and 88  8, respectively, in ipsilateral frontal cortex. The
numbers of GFAP + HSP20 + DAPI specific stained cells in
ipsilatersl cortex for (EP + MCAO) and (EP+ + MCAO)
group rats were 56  5 vs. 102  10, respectively. The number
of NeuN + HSP 20 + DAPI (Fig. 5a) and GFAP + HSP-
20 + DAPI (Fig. 5b) triple-positive cells were calculated and
summed 3 days post-MCAO. EP+ + MCAO+ group rats also
had significantly more NeuN + HSP 20 + DAPI (62  11 vs.
25  3, P < 005) and more GFAP + HSP 20 + DAPI (156  8
vs. 94  14, P < 005) triple-positive cells than did the
EP + MCAO+ group rats (Fig. 5a and b, B vs. A). The
increased numbers of HSP-20-containing neurons (Fig. 5a, C vs.
B) and glial cells (Fig. 5b, C vs. B) were significantly reduced by
siRNA-HSP 20 (P < 001; C vs. B) but not by siRNA-vector
(P > 005; D vs. B).
Discussion
Gene silencing by RNA interference has emerged as a promising
method of inhibiting the expression of target genes and
inducing knockdown of associated proteins [16,17]. Topical
injection of naked small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been
used successfully to induce gene silencing surrounding the
injection site [18]. We have shown that microinjection of pSUPER
plasmid expressing HSP 72 small interfering RNA into the
spinal cord intraoperatively significantly inhibits HSP 72
expression in spinal cord [19]. In the present study, we further
show that intracerebral injection of pSUPER plasmid expressing
HSP 20 small interfering RNA (siRNA-HSP 20) also inhibits
HSP 20 expression in frontal cortex. Overexpression of HSP 20
in frontal cortex caused by EP+ is also significantly inhibited by
siRNA-HSP 20 but not its delivery media (siRNA vector)
microinjected intracerebrally and intra-operatively.
Here we report that, in a ischaemic stroke of MCAO, exercised
rats (given pre-MCAO exercise) had significantly higher
numbers of both the HSP20-containing neurons and HSP20-
containing glial cells, lower neurological motor deficit, fewer

cerebral infarction, and fewer neuronal and glial apoptotic cells
than did nonexercised rats. pSUPER plasmid expressing HSP
20 microinjected into the injured cerebral cortex intraoperatively
, in addition to reducing the numbers of both the HSP-
20 containing neurons and the HSP20-containing glia, significantly
attenuate the beneficial effects of EP+ in reducing
MCAO-induced functional deficits, cerebral infarction, and
neuronal and astroglial apoptosis. An inversed correlation
exists between the outcomes of ischaemic stroke and the
exercise-based neuroprotection. The data indicate that
neuronal and glial HSP 20-mediated EP+ is a promising
strategy for people who undergo a transient ischaemic
attack [2].
Data from exercise studies show that long-term on intense
exercise induces HSP 72 [20], HSP 60 and HSP 8 [21], HSP 27
and a-b-crystallin [22]. Our present study demonstrates that
overexpression of brain HSP 20 can be induced by long-term
moderate exercise in rats. In the brain, a-b-crystallin is
expressed primarily in oligodendrocytes and to a lesser degree
in astrocytes, and plays a role in protection of intermediate
filament systems from abnormal aggregation [23]. Our present
results further demonstrates that overexpression of neuronal
and glial HSP 20 can be induced by EP+ and plays a role in
attenuating both neuronal and glial apoptosis caused by
ischaemia and reperfusion in a transient ischaemic stroke
model.
Chronic exercise elicits adaptations in the heart that improve
pump function and confer cardioprotection [24]. Exercise
training also causes increased abundance of HSP 20 in the rat
heart [24]. Of interest, several findings have demonstrated that
sustained b-adrenergic stimulation results in expression and
phosphorylation of cardiac HSP 20. Moreover, HSP 20 overexpression
enhances cardiac function and renders cardioprotection
against b-agonist-mediated apoptosis and ischaemiareperfusion
injury ex vivo and in vivo [6]. These investigators
implicate HSP 20 as a potential therapeutic target not only for
ischaemic brain disorder (present findings) but also for
ischaemic heart diseases.
According to the findings of Liebelt et al. [4], significant
(P < 005) up-regulation of HSP 70 and pERK 1/2 after 3 weeks
of exercise coincided with significant (P < 005) reduction in
neuronal apoptosis and brain infarct volume in the rats with
MCAO. Inhibition of either one of these two factors showed a
significant (P < 005) reversal in the neuroprotection. Our present
results also showed inhibition of brain HSP 20 had a
significant (P < 005) reversal in the EP+-mediated neuroprotection
in MCAO rats. Thus, it appears that exercise-induced
neuroprotection could provide a remedy in which up-regulated
HSP 20, HSP 70, pERK 1/2, and other molecules simultaneously
interrupt cell death and promote survival signals.
Glial cells including astrocytes are believed to play possible
roles in exacerbating secondary brain injury after a neurotrauma
[25]. On the other hand, other evidence shows that
astrocytes regulate brain homeostasis and limit brain injury by
providing recovery in brain [6]. In the present study, we
observed that the increased numbers of GFAP-HSP20-DAPI
specific stained cells by MCAO in rats could be significantly

protective role of overexpression of the HSP20-containing glial
cells in ischaemic brain tissues.
Finally, it should be mentioned that MCAO, in addition to
inducing brain infarct in the ipsilateral hemisphere, may cause
a remote lesion in the contralateral hemisphere, (as shown in
Fig. 3). The reason for this event should be explored in futural
studies.
In conclusion, significant (P < 005) increase of the numbers
of both the HSP20-containing neurons and HSP20-containing
glial cells after 3 weeks of exercise coincided with significant
(P < 005) reduction in both neuronal and astroglial apoptosis,
brain infarct and neurological deficits in ischaemic stroke rats.
Reduction of the numbers of both HSP20-containing neurons
and HSP20-containing glial cells by PSUPER small interfering
RNAί showed a significant (P < 005) reversal in the neuroprotection.
Our results indicate an inversed correlation between
the exercise-mediated up-regulating neuronal and glial
expression of HSP20 and outcomes of ischaemic stroke. Thus,
HSP 20 may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for ischaemic
stroke-induced neuronal and astroglial apoptosis.
