Abstract—This study aims to develop a transient ischemic
attack (TIA) model in conscious animals and uses this
model to investigate the effect of TIA on subsequent permanent
ischemia. TIA was induced by injecting designed temperature-sensitive
melted solid lipid microparticles with a
melting point around body temperature into male Wistar rats
via arterial cannulation. Neurologic deficit was monitored
immediately after the injection without anesthesia. According
to the clinical definition of TIA, rats were divided into
neurologic symptom durations <24-h, 24–48-h andP48-h
groups. The lipid microparticle-induced infarct volumes
were small in the <24-h and 24–48-h groups, while the volumes
were five times larger in theP48-h group. Permanent
ischemic stroke was induced 3 d after the induction of TIA
by injecting a different kind of embolic particle manufactured
by blending chitin and PLGA. The <24-h group had
less severe neurologic deficits and smaller infarct volumes
than that of 24–48-h and control (without prior lipid microparticle
treatment) rats. Taken together, we successfully
develop a TIA animal model which allows us to monitor
the neurologic deficit in real-time. By adopting this model,
we validate that TIA (<24 h) preconditioning protects the
brain from subsequent permanent ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is the sudden onset of
transient neurologic deficit with full recovery within 24 h
(Easton et al., 2009). TIA has been recognized as a risk
factor for permanent ischemic stroke (Easton et al.,
2009). However, in the animal model that TIA is induced
by transient occlusion of ipsilateral cerebral arteries,
ischemic preconditioning has been recognized as a beneficial
factor for ischemic stroke (Perez-Pinzon et al., 1997;
Kitagawa et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008). Several clinical
studies also support the premise that prodromal TIA may
reduce the severity of permanent ischemic stroke and
decrease the infarct size as detected in the perfusion
scan of magnetic resonance imaging (Weih et al., 1999;
Moncayo et al., 2000). However, it has been argued that
the latter studies were retrospective in nature, with most
of the information (relationship between TIA and a following
permanent ischemic stroke) being culled from medical
histories or descriptions from family members of patients.
A more recent study investigating a much larger cohort
failed to find the protective effects of preceded TIA on permanent
ischemic stroke (Johnston, 2004). The effect of
preceded TIA on ischemic stroke deserves further
characterization.
A major drawback of previous studies in
characterizing the effect of TIA preconditioning on
permanent stroke severity is that they were unable to
evaluate the exact temporal relationship between TIA
and neurologic deficit. In clinical studies, it has been
demonstrated that the duration of TIA-induced
neurologic deficit is closely related to the incidence of
stroke. For example, TIA symptoms lasting more than
one h increase the incidence of stroke or stroke
recurrence (Giles et al., 2006; Ois et al., 2008; Sciolla
and Melis, 2008). However, few animal studies focused
on the duration of neurologic deficit induced by TIA,
because in most animal studies TIA was induced by transient
occlusion of brain circulation under anesthesia. It is
impossible to evaluate the onset time of neurologic deficit
secondary to TIA until hours after recovering from anesthesia.
Therefore, an animal model that permits inspection
of the behavior immediately after the induction of

TIA is essential to examine the association of preceded
TIA and the severity of the following ischemic stroke.
The objectives of this study are to develop a TIA
animal model that allows us to evaluate the TIA-induced
neurologic deficit in real-time and to evaluate the effect
of TIA on the neurologic outcomes of subsequent
permanent ischemic stroke. We develop the TIA animal
model by injecting artificial emboli which were designed
to melt in vivo after injection into the brain circulation.
Lipid microparticles, especially solid lipid microparticles,
have been used for drug delivery carriers because of
their ideal characteristics of homogenous sphere
appearance and rapid and consistent dissolvability
(Jannin et al., 2008). By taking these advantages, we
designed solid lipid microparticles that melt at body temperature
to produce artificial emboli. The injection of
melted solid lipid microparticles was performed without
anesthesia, so the TIA-induced neurologic deficit could
be evaluated immediately from the onset of neurologic
symptoms. After completely recovering from neurologic
deficit, a different type of artificial particle emboli,
manufactured by chitin and poly(D,L-Lactide-co-glycolide)
(chitin/PLGA)-blended microparticles, were injected to
induce permanent ischemic stroke (Tsai et al., 2011).
Neurologic deficit was evaluated immediately after the
injection of chitin/PLGA microparticles. Regional cerebral
blood flow was determined before, during, and after the
injection of microparticles. Brain infarction was assessed
by Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) stain.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials
Gelucire 33/01 and Gelucire 43/01 were purchased from
Gattefosse Co. (St-Priest, France). PLGA 50/50 (MW:
40 dDa, Lactide/glicolide ratio: 50/50) was obtained from
Sigma–Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Chitin was
purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. (Tokyo,
Japan). Tetrazolium Red (2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium
Chloride) was obtained from Alfa Aesar Co. (Ward Hill,
MA). All other chemicals and solvents were of analytical
grade and purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co.
Preparation of melted solid lipid microparticles for
TIA
The solid lipid microparticles were made by adding the oil
phase into the water phase containing hydrophilic
surfactant. The preparations were manufactured with
the rationale that the used lipids and surfactant would
be biocompatible and biodegradable. Gelucires have
been used as surfactants, co-surfactants and lipid
matrixes in drug delivery systems and are generally
recognized as safe (Shimpi et al., 2005). The oil phase
was prepared by mixing Gelucire 43/01 (melting point of
43C/hydrophile–lipophile balances of 1) and Gelucire
33/01 (melting point of 33C/hydrophile-lipophile balances
of 1). Gelucires are solid lipid materials composed
of mono-, di-, and triglycerides and mono- and di-fatty
acid esters of polyethylene glycol (Jannin et al., 2008).
A ratio of 1:1 between Gelucire 43/01 and Gelucire
33/01 was used to produce solid lipid microparticles that
have a melting point of 38C, which was verified using
a melting point apparatus (Mel-Temp II, Laboratory
Devices, Inc., Tarzana, CA, USA). The blended oil phase
was homogenously mixed by heating the Gelucire lipids
above their melting point. The water phase was prepared
by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate in purified water to get a
final concentration of 1%. Both the oil phase and water
phase were kept at 70C and were mixed by slowly
dripping the oil phase directly into the water phase while
stirring at the speed of 300 rpm for 5 min. The temperature
was then allowed to slowly cool down to room
temperature. The gelled lipid microparticles were allowed
to harden in the cool water phase while stirring at the
same speed for another 24 h. After hardening, the microparticles
were filtered and rinsed with deionized water and
the particles were sieved by standard U.S. size meshes
from 20 to 355 mesh (Analytical Test, Retsch, Germany)
before drying overnight. The finished microparticles were
kept at 4C in the refrigerator. The particle size of
75–90lm was used as emboli for inducing transient brain
ischemia.
Differential scanning calorimetry of melted solid lipid
microparticles
The thermal transitions of the lipid microparticles were
analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The
melted solid lipid nanoparticles were freeze-dried before
the measurement. The differential scanning calorimetry
was performed by a PerkinElmer DSC calorimeter
(DSC7, Waltham, MA, USA). Solid lipid nanoparticles
(5 mg) were put in aluminum pans and the thermal
profiles were obtained as the temperature increased
from 10 to 55C at a rate of 5C/min under nitrogen.
Scanning electronic microscopy of melted solid lipid
microparticles
This method has been described previously (Tsai et al.,
2012). The melted solid lipid microparticles were attached
onto double-sided adhesive tape and fixed to an aluminum
stage. The microparticles were sputter-coated with
gold using a Hitachi coating unit and the surface of the
microparticles were examined using a Hitachi S-2300
Scanning electronic microscopy (Japan).
Preparation of chitin/PLGA microparticles for
ischemic stroke
The detailed procedure to prepare chitin/PLGA
microparticles has been described elsewhere (Tsai
et al., 2011). Briefly, chitin powder was dissolved in
dimethylacetamide solution containing 5% LiCl to make
1% chitin solution. Chitin/PLGA 50/50 mixed solution
was formulated by directly suspending the PLGA 50/50
powder in the prepared chitin solution in 1:1 ratio. To
produce microparticles, chitin/PLGA 50/50 mixed solution
maintained at 70C was dropped through a syringe (27
gauge) into 1% sodium lauryl sulfate solution bath maintained
at 25C, and then allowed to harden the blended
microparticles for 12 h. Finished microparticles were

sieved by standard U.S. size meshes from 40 to 400
mesh (Analytical Test, Retsch, Germany).
Animal model
All experimental protocols were performed according to
National Institutes of Health Guideline for animal
research (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals) and approved by the Kaohsiung Medical
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Male Wister rats (3-month-old, 300–350 g) were used in
this study. All animals were housed in a temperaturecontrolled
animal care facility under diurnal lighting and
given free access to food and water.
The surgical procedures have been described
previously (Tsai et al., 2011). In short, all animals were
made to fast overnight and were anesthetized by an
intra-peritoneal injection of 300-mg/kg choral hydrate.
During operation, the body temperature was maintained
at 37C by an automated temperature regulation system.
The hair of the rat was cut and head skin was excised
from the midline to expose the skull. Povidone–iodine
(10%) was used for local sterilization. The skull was
thinned and two miniature probe-holders of the Laser
Doppler instrument (MBF3D, Moor Instruments, Ltd.,
Axminster, UK) were fixed on the skull, 3 mm lateral and
0.5 mm posterior to the bregma on both hemispheres.
The skin was then sutured with miniholder exposed. Tetracyclin
HCl (1%) ointment was applied to the wound 2–3
times per day to prevent infection.
The rat was then fixed in supine position on an
operation plate and midline excision of ventral neck was
made to expose the bifurcation of right carotid artery.
The PE-10 catheter (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) was
inserted through the external carotid artery (ECA) to the
bifurcation of the common carotid artery (CCA), while
the four ipsilateral collateral cerebral arteries were
ligated. The PE-10 catheter was then secured by one
end fixed to the ECA and the other end exposed on the
neck as an indwelling injection tube after the closure of
the surgical wound. Fifty microliters of heparin solution
(50 I.U./ml) was administered in order to prevent clotting
on the PE-10 tube. Surgical wounds were carefully
cleaned to prevent infection.
After recovery from the operation, all rats received a
neurologic evaluation. If any neurologic deficits were
noticed, the rats would be excluded from further studies.
We induced TIA and ischemic stroke without anesthesia
by injecting artificial emboli through the secured PE10
tube.
Laser Doppler instrument for monitoring cerebral
blood flow
Local cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery was
initially monitored before and after the insertion of PE-10
tube. After recovery from the surgery, regional cerebral
blood flow was recorded immediately before the
injection of microparticles and then again after injection
at the following time points: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min
and 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 h. Throughout the entire
monitoring process, the rat was awake without
anesthesia.
Estimation of the duration of ischemia-induced
neurologic deficit
For inducing transient brain ischemia, we injected 0.5 mg
of melted solid lipid microparticles (75–90lm in diameter)
via the indwelling PE10 tube without anesthesia.
Neurologic deficit was evaluated immediately after the
injection (0 min) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 36
and 48 h post injection. We graded the neurologic deficit
of the rats using the following criteria: 0 – no neurologic
defect, 1 – one-paw clumsiness or clasping during tail
suspension, 2 – tilt, 3 – rounding in only a unilateral
circle, 4 – akinesia, 5 – seizure, 6 – stupor or lack of
any spontaneous movement, 7 – death. The rats that
died within 3 h after surgery were withdrawn from the
study. All rats were evaluated randomly by the same
investigator.
Permanent ischemic stroke was induced 3 days later
after full recovery from transient ischemia-induced
neurologic deficit. We injected 0.5 mg of Chitin/PLGA
blended particles (75–90lm in diameter) via the
indwelling PE 10 tube to induce ischemic stroke as
described previously (Tsai et al., 2011). The time durations
of evaluating neurologic deficit from ischemic stroke
were the same as transient brain ischemia.
Calculation of the infarction volume of the rat brain
The procedure for calculation of infarction volume has
been described elsewhere (Tsai et al., 2011). In short,
the rat brains were removed and positioned in a rat brain
matrix (Activational Systems, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) after
deep anesthesia. Each brain was cut, from the tip of olfactory
bulb to the caudal end of the cerebellum, into 12 coronal
sections, 2 mm thick. The sections were stained by
0.05% TTC solution for 30 min and fixed in 4% formaldehyde
solution for 24 h. The infarct areas were traced and
quantified by an image analysis system (ImageJ v. 1.36b
version, NIH, USA). For interpreting the infarction volume
of different functional areas, the infarct area of each functional
area including the cortex, basal ganglia & thalamus,
hippocampus, and cerebellum & brain stem were calculated
separately. We obtained final infarct volume after
correcting with cerebral edema.
Statistical analyses
All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. The behavior
score of the four different symptom duration groups or
the four pretreatment groups were assayed using
repeated measures (mixed-model) analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with post-injection time as within-subject factor
and group as between subject factor. Bonferroni
posttest was used to compare between subject factors
at each time point. The results of infarct volume in four
different groups were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA
followed by the Bonferroni posttest.

RESULTS
Physicochemical characteristics of the melted solid
lipid microparticles
The solid lipid microparticles were produced by
emulsifying the oil phase, prepared from a mixture of
different melting points of Gelucire, and the water
phase, containing hydrophilic surfactant. We mixed
Gelucire 33/01 and Gelucire 43/01 at a ratio of 1:1 to
form solid lipid microparticles with a melting point of
38C and hydrophile–lipophile balances of 1 (38/01).
Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the
melting process took place with a maximum peak at
34.8C for Gelucire 43/01 and 20.8C for Gelucire 33/
01 with a shoulder peak at 24.5C ( Fig. 1A). The
thermograms of blended Gelucires (38/01) revealed a
large endothermic event from 13.8C to 42.3C with
two distinct polymorphs melting at different temperatures.
Gradation sieving of the solid lipid microparticles
yielded 15 size fractions ranging from 20lm to 
>355lm ( Fig. 1B). The distribution of the amount of
each size fraction was skewed; more than half of the
particles produced by our method were ofsizes between
106 and 180lm. The blended Gelucire (38/01) solid
lipid microparticles had uniform round shapes with a
porous surface (Fig. 1C).
An animal model of TIA induced by melted lipid
microparticle embolization
Thirty-one rats received a PE-10 tube catheterization in
the neck and two miniature probe-holders on the
thinned skull windows. Three rats were excluded from
the study due to failure of PE-10 catheter insertion
during anesthesia or catheter misplacement. To induce
TIA, 0.5 mg of blended Gelucire (38/01) melted solid
lipid microparticles within the range of 75–90lm (lipid
particles
75–90 lm
) were delivered to the PE-10 tube
without anesthesia. We chose the Gelucire (38/01)
melted solid lipid particles
75–90 lm
because of their
ability to melt quickly at body temperature. We used the
particle size of 75–90lm to induce embolic ischemia
because previously we have demonstrated that particles
of these size ranges induced a unique pattern of
infarction resembling lacunar infarcts (Tsai et al., 2011).
Neurologic deficit was evaluated immediately after the
injection of lipid particles
75–90 lm
until the ischemia-associated
behavior was no longer evident. All 28 rats showed
signs of neurologic deficit with different durations. Based
on the symptom duration (the latest time to observe any
neurologic deficit), the 28 rats were divided into three
groups (Fig. 2A): (1) 12 rats fully recovered from neurologic
deficit within 24 h (<24 h), (2) 10 rats fully recovered
between 24–48 h (24–48 h) and (3) six rats still showed
signs of neurologic deficit at 48 h (P48 h). We did not
notice any change in body temperature (Fig. 2B).
Laser Doppler flowmetry showed that the blood flows
of both hemispheres were unchanged after the insertion
of the PE-10 tube (Fig. 3). Injection of lipid particles
75-90
lm
reduced cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral
hemisphere with different patterns (Fig. 3A). Mixed
model ANOVA revealed that there were significant
effects of duration group (F=43.3, d.f. 2/84,
p<0.001) and post-injection time (F= 3.8, d.f. 11/84,
p<0.001) on the blood flow with no significant
interaction between these two factors (F= 1.3, d.f. 22/84,
p= 0.473). Bonferroni’s post hoc tests showed
significant changes in cerebral blood flow between <24-h
and P48-h groups (Fig. 3B). No difference between
24–48-h and <24-h groups or 24–48-h and P48-h
groups was found. On the average, the blood flow of the
<24-h group was completely restored in about 1 h and
the 24–48-h group in about 4 h after the injection of lipid
particles
75–90 lm

successfully ensued after embolization. Reduction of
cerebral blood flow was still noticeable 48 h after the
injection in theP48-h group (Fig. 3B).
Neurologic deficits in rats with different durations of
brain ischemia
The average neurologic scores of the three groups were
shown in Fig. 4A. Except some rats in the <24-h group,
all rats showed some signs of neurologic deficit within
1 min after the injection of lipid particles
75–90 lm
. Mixed
model ANOVA revealed that there were significant
effects of duration group (F=269.6, d.f. 2/700,
p<0.001) and post-injection time (F= 10.3, d.f. 27/
700, p<0.001) on the behavior score (Fig. 4A). A
significant interaction between these two factors
(F= 1.8, d.f. 54/700, p< 0.001) was evident,
suggesting that symptom duration groups have different
effects on behavior score. Bonferroni’s post hoc tests
showed that the <24-h group had lower behavior
scores (less severe) than that of 24–48-h and P48-h
groups, whereas, the 24–48-h and P48-h groups had
comparable behavior scores except at the 36- and 48-h
post-injection time points (Fig. 4A).

Lipid particles
75–90 lm
injection induced lacuna-like
small infarctions primarily in the cortex and basal
ganglia & thalamus regions; occasionally, infarctions
were observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum &
brain stem regions (Fig. 4B). Two-way ANOVA revealed
that there were significant effects of duration group
(F=27.2, d.f. 2/125, p<0.001) and brain region
(F= 12.5, d.f. 4/125, p<0.001) on the infarct volume
(Fig. 4C). A significant interaction between these two
factors (F= 5.1, d.f. 8/125, p< 0.001) was evident,
suggesting that symptom duration groups have different
effects on infarct volume. Bonferroni’s post hoc test
showed that the >48-h group had larger infarct volume
in the whole brain and cortex than that of the <24-h
and 24–48-h groups (Fig. 4C). No difference in infarct
volume could be found in any brain region between the
<24-h and the 24–48-h groups.
Different durations of preceded brain ischemia
induce differential protection against permanent
ischemic stroke
We then investigate the effect of preceded brain ischemia
on the severity of neurologic deficit of the following
permanent ischemic stroke in a different batch of 59
rats. Among them, nine rats were excluded from the
study because of PE-10 catheter insertion failure during
anesthesia, catheter drop or death due to anesthesia.
The remaining 50 rats were divided into two groups: 12
rats served as saline controls, while the other 38 rats
were subjected to TIA induction. Immediately after the
lipid particles
75–90 lm
injection, all 38 rats displayed
neurologic signs: 21 rats fully recovered from neurologic
deficit within 24 h (<24 h), nine rats fully recovered
between 24 and 48 h (24–48 h) and eight rats still
showed signs of neurologic deficit at 48 h (P48 h). We
excluded the P48-h group from the following studies
because these animals showed an extended duration of
neurologic symptoms and large infarct volume that
would interfere with the evaluations of the following
ischemic stroke. Permanent ischemic stroke was
induced in all 42 rats (control group 12 rats, <24-h
group 21 rats and 24–48-h group 9 rats), 72 h after the
injection of lipid particles
75–90 lm
, by chitin/PLGA
microparticle
75–90 lm
embolization as described
previously (Tsai et al., 2011).
Laser Doppler flowmetry showed that saline injection
did not alter the cerebral blood flow (Fig. 5A), while the
changing patterns of cerebral blood flow of the <24-h
and 24–48-h groups were similar to those shown in
Fig. 3B. At 72 h after the first injection of lipid
particles75–90lm, a second injection of the chitin/
PLGA microparticle75–90lm was given to the rats.
Within 5 min after the second injection, the cerebral
blood flow levels reduced to less than 50% in all three
groups and lasted for more than 4 h (Fig. 5B). Cerebral
blood flow levels in the <24-h group were completely
recovered and significantly higher than that of the saline
injected control group at 24 h after the injection of the
chitin/PLGA microparticle75–90lm( Fig. 5B).
Almost immediately after the injection of chitin/PLGA
microparticle
75–90 lm
, rats exhibited signs of neurologic
deficits. The severity of the neurologic symptom of the
control group gradually increases in the first 4 h after
the injection of the chitin/PLGA microparticle
75–90 lm

score, with a significant interaction (F= 2.7, d.f. 50/
1014, p<0.001) between these two factors. However,
this interacting effect was mainly due to the increased
neurologic symptoms in the control group as compared
with the unchanged neurologic symptoms in the two
transient ischemia groups over time (F= 0.4, d.f. 24/
700, p>0.5) (Fig. 6A). Bonferroni’s post hoc test
showed that the <24-h group had less severe
neurologic symptoms than that of the control group
since 20-min post-injection time; while no such
protection was noticed in the 24–48-h group (Fig. 6A).
The TTC-negative infarction regions, induced by the

(Fig. 6C). Bonferroni’s post hoc test showed that the
<24-h group had less total and cortical infarct areas
than those of controls; whereas, the 24–48-h and
control groups had similar infarct volumes in all
investigated brain regions (Fig. 6C).
The American Heart Association/American Stroke
Association Stroke Council defines TIA as a transient
episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal
brain ischemia without acute infarction (Easton et al.,
2009). In this study, we used the ‘‘a priori’’ experimental
design and classified the rats with symptom duration
<24-h as TIA without knowing the infarct volume. As clinically
TIA is indistinguishable from cerebral infarction with
transient signs (CITS), which is characterized by symptoms
and signs resolving within 24 h despite residual
brain infarction, the <24-h group may contain rats of both
true TIA and CITS. Indeed, ‘‘a posteriori’’ analysis
revealed that there was a group of rats that fully recovered
from neurologic deficit in less than 5 h (hereafter
designated as <5-h group). The <5-h rats restored their
blood flow in less than 30 min and no infarct could be
detected in any of the four brain areas. Furthermore, in
the chitin/PLGA microparticle-induced permanent ischemic
stroke, the <5-h group had less severe neurologic
symptoms than those of the rest of the <24-h (hereafter
designated as 5–24 h) rats (Fig. 6D). Marginal differences
(p= 0.07) in the chitin/PLGA microparticle-induced
infarct areas were also evident between the <5-h and
5–24-h groups. By comparing the neurologic symptoms
of the <5-h, 5–24-h and 24–48-h groups, we found that
the severity of neurologic symptoms increased by
increasing the TIA duration (Fig. 6D). These results suggest
, within the 24-h critical window, the shorter the TIA
duration, the stronger the protection against subsequent
ischemic stroke.
DISCUSSION
It has been suggested that TIA may improve the
outcomes of following ischemic stroke in animals.
However, the benefits of TIA preconditioning are still
unclear in clinical studies. One possible reason for such
discrepancy is the unknown association between the
duration of TIA and the outcome of permanent ischemic
stroke – most animal and clinical studies were unable to
get exact duration of neurologic deficit induced by TIA.
To target this question, we designed an animal model
that allowed us to monitor the neurologic behavior in
real-time after the injection of emboli. Most of the
previous animal models could only evaluate permanent
disability as a research target, because animals take
hours to completely recovery from the surgery. In
contrast, our model evaluates the functional recovery in
neurologic deficiency immediately after transient
ischemia occurred in the brain. Furthermore, our model
allows us to track a process of functional recovery in a
very mild brain injury secondary to ischemia that may
gain complete recovery shortly after a stroke occurs.
These mildly injured animals are often ignored or go
undetected in previous models because these animals
may not demonstrate permanent disability or infarction
assessed by TTC stain. Therefore, our paradigm is an
original and novel model because it provides the

opportunity to evaluate functional recovery in real-time
secondary to transient ischemia.
We developed thermo-sensitive solid lipid
microparticles that are ready-to-melt in body temperature
as emboli to induce transient brain ischemia. The
chemical and physical characteristics of the lipid
microparticles imitate the clinical emboli. In clinical
situations, microembolism is recognized as an important
cause of TIA (de Bruijn et al., 2006), and lipid-rich emboli
derived from the heart with atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis
are the major source of microembolism. Furthermore
, our model created conditions very similar to the
clinical definition of TIA. The lipid microparticle-induced
reduction of blood flow restored within a few hours in most
treated animals (78.5% of rats in <24-h and 24–48-h
groups), indicating the melting of microparticles successfully
ensued after embolization. These animals developed
symptoms of transient brain ischemia while the rats were
not under the effects of anesthesia. In contrast to most
animal studies that only estimate the duration of occlusion
of cerebral circulation reflecting the state of impairment of
blood supply to the focal brain region, we estimate the
duration of neurological symptoms reflecting the state of
neurologic function recovery. Compared with the occlusion
time, the duration of neurological deficits resembles
better to the real situation of clinical TIA. Furthermore,
both the <24-h and 24–48-h groups had only a small volume
of infarct area (<20 mm3), very similar to the pathologic
findings in the clinical TIA/CITS patients, in which up
to 50% of TIA/CITS patients having abnormal brain image
findings only showed minor degree of cerebral infarction
(Easton et al., 2009). Taken together, our animal model
of transient brain ischemia not only mimics the real situation
of TIA in humans, but also resembles well to the pathogenesis
of TIA.
The primary objective of this study was to develop a
TIA animal model allowing us to monitor neurologic
deficit in real-time. We then used this model to validate

the effect of TIA on the severity of subsequent permanent
ischemic stroke. Although TIA preconditioning seems
unlikely to be adopted in clinical application, this
reproducible model offers a platform upon which we can
study the mechanisms that underlie the protective effect
of TIA preconditioning. Previous studies have suggested
that repair mechanisms of the body may play key roles
in the effect of preconditioning, similar to the ‘‘hormesis’’
effect observed in toxicology (Mattson, 2008; Ristow
et al., 2009). Both preconditioning and hormesis suggest
that stressor/toxin when given at a level below its harmful/
toxic threshold may activate or upregulate defense mechanisms.
The harmful threshold varies from stressor to
stressor and depends on the body’s defense capacity.
Importantly, upregulated defense mechanisms not only
fix the stressor-induced injuries, but also protect damages
subsequently caused by other similar stressors (Mattson,
2008). For example, exercise induces energy crisis,
hypoxia, hyperthermia, dehydration and oxidative stress;
all are potentially harmful to the body. However, regular
exercise at moderate intensity increases the body’s
defense capacity at multiple levels, such as anti-oxidation,
energy reserves, trophic factors, etc. Thus, regular exercise
can also be considered as a kind of preconditioning
(Mattson, 2008; Ristow et al., 2009). Any reagent or treatment
that induces similar biological responses as in TIA
preconditioning could potentially benefit the brain, especially
in those who are at risk of ischemic attack. The idea
of hypoxia preconditioning has been employed to
enhance cardiac function in humans. When humans were
subjected to hypoxic exercise training, the functions of
cardiac/muscular hemodynamic adaptations and circulating
progenitor cells were enhanced (Wang et al., 2014).
The levels of angiogenic factors were also increased by
hypoxic exercise training (Wang et al., 2014). The intermittent
hypoxic intervention regimen may induce similar
responses as TIA and become a beneficial means to lessen
the severity of ischemia-induced injuries in the brain.
It is interesting to note that although the rats of 24–48-
h group had more severe neurologic symptoms than that
of the <24-h group, the total infarct volumes of these two
groups were comparable. Detailed analysis revealed a
differential distribution of infarct area in these two
groups. In the <24-h group, more than 90% of infarct
area was located in the cortex; whereas, in the 24–48-h
group, only about 60% of infarct area was in the cortex
(Fig. 3B, C). The other major (35%) infarct area was
in the basal ganglia & thalamus. Similar distribution
pattern (involving the subcortical area) was also noticed
in theP48-h group whose cortical area also occupied
60% of the total infarct area. As basal ganglia and
thalamus are involved in motor execution, it is not
surprising to see that infarction occurring in these two
areas gives a more severe motor-related neurologic
symptom than that occurring in the cortical area.
Whether the differential distribution of the infarct area
determines the precondition-associated protection, as
observed in Fig. 4, awaits further investigation.
Nonetheless, our results indicate that the duration of
TIA is an important determining factor to predictor the
outcomes of subsequent permanent ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION
We have developed an animal model that allows us to
monitor the neurologic symptoms immediately after the
injection of emboli. This animal model also allows us to
evaluate the influence of the neurologic symptom
duration on the outcome of the following ischemic stroke.
Furthermore, our model allows us to track a process of
functional recovery in a very mild brain injury that may
gain complete recovery shortly after a stroke occurs.
When neurologic deficit of transient ischemia is
recovered within 24 h, transient occlusion of cerebral
circulation prior to ischemic stroke is beneficial to the
outcome of ischemic stroke. If the neurologic symptom of
transient ischemia lasts longer than 24 h, there is no
protection against following ischemic stroke.
Furthermore, within the 24-h window, the duration of
preceded transient ischemia-induced neurological deficits
is reversely related to the outcome of subsequent
ischemic stroke. This animal model would provide a
better platform to investigate the underlying mechanism
of TIA-induced ischemic tolerance.
