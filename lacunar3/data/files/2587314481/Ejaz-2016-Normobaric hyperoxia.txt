‘True’ transient ischaemic attacks are characterized not only clinically, but also radiologically by a lack of corresponding changes
on magnetic resonance imaging. During a transient ischaemic attack it is assumed that the affected tissue is penumbral but rescued
by early spontaneous reperfusion. There is, however, evidence from rodent studies that even brief focal ischaemia not resulting in
tissue infarction can cause extensive selective neuronal loss associated with long-lasting sensorimotor impairment but normal
magnetic resonance imaging. Selective neuronal loss might therefore contribute to the increasingly recognized cognitive impairment
occurring in patients with transient ischaemic attacks. It is therefore relevant to consider treatments to reduce brain damage
occurring with transient ischaemic attacks. As penumbral neurons are threatened by markedly constrained oxygen delivery, improving
the latter by increasing arterial O
2
content would seem logical. Despite only small increases in arterial O
2
content,
normobaric oxygen therapy experimentally induces significant increases in penumbral O
2
pressure and by such may maintain
the penumbra alive until reperfusion. Nevertheless, the effects of normobaric oxygen therapy on infarct volume in rodent models
have been conflicting, although duration of occlusion appeared an important factor. Likewise, in the single randomized trial
published to date, early-administered normobaric oxygen therapy had no significant effect on clinical outcome despite reduced
diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth during therapy. Here we tested the hypothesis that normobaric oxygen therapy prevents
both selective neuronal loss and sensorimotor deficits in a rodent model mimicking true transient ischaemic attack. Normobaric
oxygen therapy was applied from the onset and until completion of 15 min distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously
hypertensive rats, a strain representative of the transient ischaemic attack-prone population. Whereas normoxic controls showed
normal magnetic resonance imaging but extensive cortical selective neuronal loss associated with microglial activation (present both
at Day 14 in vivo and at Day 28 post-mortem) and marked and long-lasting sensorimotor deficits, normobaric oxygen therapy
completely prevented sensorimotor deficit (P50.02) and near-completely Day 28 selective neuronal loss (P50.005). Microglial
activation was substantially reduced at Day 14 and completely prevented at Day 28 (P = 0.002). Our findings document that
normobaric oxygen therapy administered during ischaemia nearly completely prevents the neuronal death, microglial inflammation
and sensorimotor impairment that characterize this rodent true transient ischaemic attack model. Taken together with the available
literature, normobaric oxygen therapy appears a promising therapy for short-lasting ischaemia, and is attractive clinically as it
could be started at home in at-risk patients or in the ambulance in subjects suspected of transient ischaemic attack/early stroke. It
may also be a straightforward adjunct to reperfusion therapies, and help prevent subtle brain damage potentially contributing to
long-term cognitive and sensorimotor impairment in at-risk populations.

Introduction
According to their new tissue-based definition, transient ischaemic
attacks (TIAs) are characterized both clinically by
focal neurological symptoms of ischaemic origin lasting
524h, and radiologically by a lack of topographically congruent
changes on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI performed
within 2 weeks of the clinical event (Saver, 2008). Such
‘true’ TIAs account for 20–50% of all clinically-diagnosed
TIAs (Brazzelli et al., 2014). The vast majority of TIAs are
believed to be secondary to transient arterial occlusion from
an upstream blood clot with rapid spontaneous fibrinolysis.
During a TIA it is assumed that tissue perfusion is reduced
below the penumbra threshold, causing the focal symptoms,
but that early spontaneous reperfusion salvages the penumbra
in whole or in large part, causing full clinical recovery
within 24h either with no MRI sequelae or with a very
small asymptomatic DWI lesion that sometimes disappears
secondarily (Oppenheim et al., 2006).
There is however recent evidence from rat studies that
even brief middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion not resulting
in tissue infarction can cause variably extensive selective
neuronal loss (SNL) affecting both the striatum and
the cortex or only the latter in case of proximal or distal
occlusion, respectively (see Baron et al., 2014 for review),
associated with significant and long-lasting sensorimotor
impairment (Sicard et al., 2006; Ejaz et al., 2015a). SNL
is characterized by patchy and/or layer-wise partial loss of
neurons without loss of glial cells, other tissue constituents
and extracellular matrix, and with normal standard MRI
after the ischaemic event, and as such strikingly differs
from infarction (Baron et al., 2014). Although there is no
direct evidence that it occurs after a TIA in humans, SNL
has been documented in patients with full/nearly-full clinical
recovery following early reperfusion for severe stroke
(Saur et al., 2006; Guadagno et al., 2008; Carrera et al.,
2013), as well as in patients with permanent internal carotid
artery occlusion or MCA occlusion and repeated TIAs
(Yamauchi et al., 2007, 2009, 2011). It has been suggested
that SNL, which is consistently accompanied by topographically
congruent microglial activation lasting several weeks
(Baron et al., 2014), may contribute to the increasingly
recognized subtle cognitive impairment occurring in patients
with TIAs, which can be temporary or long lasting
(Pendlebury et al., 2011; Sivakumar et al., 2014; van Rooij
et al., 2014). It has thus been suggested that accumulating
SNL resulting from symptomatic (i.e. TIAs) or asymptomatic
small emboli (e.g. lodging in non-eloquent brain areas)
reduces the cognitive reserve in such patients, possibly ultimately
contributing to cognitive decline, in association or
not with mild Alzheimer pathology (Baron et al., 2014). If
this is correct, TIAs should no longer be just considered as
potential heralds of imminent stroke (Rothwell et al.,
2011), but also as events causing ‘hidden’ tissue damage
and hence facilitating permanent behavioural impairment in
the longer-term. Given this paradigm shift, it is in turn
important to consider treatments aiming to reduce brain
damage from TIAs.
Given the inference of spontaneous recanalization, preventing
tissue damage from TIAs should target penumbral
protection until reperfusion occurs, so-called ‘penumbra
freezing’ (Fisher and Saver, 2015). Neurons in the penumbra
being at risk from constrained oxygen delivery, increasing
arterial O2
content seems a logical approach.
Hyperbaric oxygen as a potential therapy for ischaemic
stroke has been tested in 11 small-scale randomized controlled
trials but shown in one recent meta-analysis to have
no significant benefit on mortality and no consistent effect
on functional scales (Bennett et al., 2014). Accordingly,
normobaric oxygen therapy (NBO) has been tested both
in rodent models and in small-scale clinical trials.
Critically, the extremely low levels of tissue oxygen pressure
in the penumbra (Crockard et al., 1976; Harris et al.,
1987; Hoffman et al., 1996, 1999; Liu et al., 2004; Hou
et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; Baskerville et al., 2011) are
significantly improved by NBO despite the only mild increase
in total arterial O
2
content (Liu et al., 2004, 2006;
Shin et al., 2007; Baskerville et al., 2011). In turn, this
could maintain the penumbra alive until reperfusion
occurs. Accordingly, beneficial effects of NBO on infarct
volume have been repeatedly reported in rodent models
(Flynn and Auer, 2002; Singhal et al., 2002a; Kim et al.,
2005; Liu et al., 2006; Henninger et al., 2007; Shin et al.,
2007; Esposito et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2013). However, in
some studies the beneficial effect was only marginal

(Henninger et al., 2007, 2009), while lack of benefit has
also been repeatedly reported (Kim et al., 2005; Beynon
et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2007; Fujiwara et al., 2009;
Liang et al., 2015). Consequently, there is currently no
clear consensus on the benefits of NBO in rodent stroke
models, although one caveat when critically assessing this
literature is lack of, or too delayed, reperfusion in some
reports. Indeed, it has recently become clear that significant
protection of the penumbra cannot be efficient unless early
reperfusion also occurs (Fisher, 2011). This factor may in
turn explain the limited benefit from early-administered
NBO on 3-month clinical outcome despite reduced DWI
lesion growth during therapy in the single randomized
trial published to date (Singhal et al., 2005). Thus, testing
the effects of NBO in very brief MCA occlusion mimicking
true TIA is worth considering, but has not been reported so
far. NBO is a particularly attractive therapy because it is
clinically translatable and could be started at home or in
the ambulance in appropriate patients.
Applying this straightforward mechanistic reasoning, we
therefore carried out a translational study in spontaneously
hypertensive rats, a strain representative of the TIA-prone
population, specifically to test the hypothesis that NBO
given right from the onset of brief MCA occlusion mimicking
true TIA and until recanalization prevents SNL and
sensorimotor impairment, and associated tissue inflammation.
This was designed as a pragmatic, clinically-orientated
study assessing these three major variables only, not the
whole gamut of possible tissue damage subtypes and behavioural
processes.
To this end, we assessed here the effects of NBO on
SNL—a temporally stable process—by means of NeuN immunofluorescence
at 28 days, while the effects on microglial
activation—a time-dependent process (Benavides et al.,
1990; Hu et al., 2012)—were assessed at two time points
in the same animals, first at Day 14 in vivo using
11C-PK11195, a reliable PET tracer for mapping microglial
activation after temporary MCA occlusion in the rat
(Hughes et al., 2012), and again post-mortem at Day 28
using IB4 immunofluorescence. Sensorimotor effects were
assessed serially using both simple neurological observation
and a behavioural task sensitive to subtle impairments.
Finally, standard MRI sequences were obtained both immediately
after reperfusion and at the time of killing.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the University of Cambridge
Ethical Review Panel. In accordance with the legislation of
UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986, the Ethical
Review Board required that the study be designed so as to
keep the number of animals used to a minimum, yet sufficient
to obtain meaningful results. Accordingly, we estimated that
the study should involve 12 subjects, six in the normoxia control
group and six in the hyperoxia group. All surgical and
imaging procedures were performed on anaesthetized 3–
6-month-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (300 g
body weight). Subjects were randomized into the two
groups, and all the animals used in this study will be reported
below. The findings in the control group, which also served to
validate our previously reported model of pure cortical SNL in
spontaneously hypertensive rats (Ejaz et al., 2015b), have been
reported (Ejaz et al., 2015a), showing normal in vivo MRI,
sensorimotor impairment still incompletely recovered 4 weeks
after the insult, and cortical SNL and microglial activation but
no infarcts at post-mortem (Ejaz et al., 2015a).
Anaesthesia
Experiments were performed in freely breathing animals.
Anaesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane administered in
a 0.3 l/min O
2
and 0.7 l/min N
2
O mix and maintained with
2% isoflurane during surgical procedures. Body temperature of
the animals was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained
at 37.0 0.5C using a heated pad throughout all surgical
procedures. Blood oxygen saturation and heart beat were continuously
monitored using a pulse-oximeter and remained
within normal ranges throughout. In the hyperoxia group,
the gas mixture administered via a nose cone was switched
to 1 l/min pure oxygen on MCA occlusion time (see below).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Microclip distal temporary MCA occlusion was performed
using the method described by Buchan et al. (1992) as implemented
in our laboratory and detailed previously
(Supplementary material) (Takasawa et al., 2007, 2011;
Hughes et al., 2010, 2012; Ejaz et al., 2013, 2015a). The
MCA clip was removed after 15min and the wound was
closed. MCA reperfusion, visually evident on clip removal as
immediate reflow distal to the clip (Hughes et al., 2010), was
present in all 12 rats of this study.
In the hyperoxia treated group, the O
2
flow was increased to
1 l/min with no N
2
O at the same time as MCA occlusion and
was maintained until clip release, while the protocol was left
unchanged (0.3l/min O
2
and 0.7 l/min N
2
O mix) for the animals
of the normoxia group.
11C-PK11195 PET
At Day 14 post-MCA occlusion, all 12 rats underwent
11C-[R]-PK11195 PET applying the same procedures as previously
reported (Hughes et al., 2012), except for using an improved
scanner (Supplementary material).
Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI was carried out at Day 14 of reperfusion immediately
after PET scanning, and included T
2
-weighted and DWI
sequences, as previously detailed (Ejaz et al., 2015a)
(Supplementary material). Given the previously reported
100% recanalization rate on magnetic resonance angiography
in temporary distal microclip MCA occlusion as implemented
in our lab (Ejaz et al., 2013, 2015a), magnetic resonance angiography
was not performed in this study.

Behavioural testing
Animals were single-housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle and had
free access to water and standard rodent chow. Training/testing
was performed in the light phase and animals were left in
their housing cages during sessions. Animals received daily
handling for at least 4 days before baseline testing to ensure
accurate behavioural results. Neurological examination was
carried out the day before surgery and at postoperative Days
1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 using Garcia’s Neuroscore. The modified
Sticky Label Test was performed 1 day before surgery and
postoperatively on Days 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28,
blind to the subject’s belonging to the control or NBO group.
Garcia’s Neuroscore consists of motor, sensory, reflex, and
observational tests to evaluate neurological deficits following
MCA occlusion in rats (Garcia et al., 1995). It is scored on a
scale from 3 to 18 (normal: 18; maximal deficit: 3), i.e. the
lower the score the worse the deficit.
Subtle sensorimotor dysfunction following MCA occlusion
was assessed using the modified Sticky Label test as previously
described (Sughrue et al., 2006; Komotar et al., 2007). This
test is sensitive to subtle ischaemic damage even when the
Neuroscore is normal (Sicard et al., 2006; Freret et al.,
2009) and, contrary to the standard version, uses a non-removable
tape. As a result, non-stroked rats spend most of the
30-s sessions trying to remove it, with no habituation effect
over time (Sughrue et al., 2006; Komotar et al., 2007). A small
patch of paper tape (2.5-cm long, 1.0-cm wide) is wrapped
around the animal’s wrist contralateral to the ischaemic
insult such that the tape sticks to itself and that the fingers
protrude from the sleeve formed. The rat is placed in its home
cage and the time spent attending to the stimulus, be it using
the teeth or contralateral paw, is recorded. Animals are given
five sessions per day, each observation period lasting for a
maximum of 30s. After each trial the tape is removed and
animals are given a resting time of53 min. Modified Sticky
Label Test performance is calculated by dividing the time attending
to the stimulus by 30s, expressing the fraction of the
observation period that the animal spends attending to the
tape. The best two ratios on each day were averaged. To
reduce noise, all daily time points for each week were collapsed
into a single value. The results of the final day of
presurgery training served as baseline for assessment of post-
MCA occlusion performance. Following stroke, sensorimotor
deficits make the rat spend less time attending to the tape than
normal (Freret et al., 2009). Deficits on the SLT are thought to
reflect a mix of subtle sensorimotor impairments including
hemi-sensory neglect and extinction, forepaw motor deficit
and impaired somatosensory integration (Schallert et al.,
1982; Komotar et al., 2007; Bouet et al., 2009; Freret et al.,
2009).
Immunofluorescence
On Day 28, the subject was perfusion-fixed, and brains
removed, fixed, coronally sectioned and stained with NeuN
and IB4 as described in detail elsewhere (Ejaz et al., 2013;
Williamson et al., 2013) (Supplementary material).
Evaluation of ischaemic damage
To quantitate the extent of ischaemic changes, we used the
method described in detail elsewhere (Ejaz et al., 2015a).
Briefly, on each digitized whole-brain section, two independent
raters blinded to the subject’s experimental group manually
traced any area with lack of NeuN-immunoreactivity or
increased IB4 binding, using a computer mouse. For this analysis
, eight coronal sections spanning the MCA territory were
selected at bregmas 2.70mm, 1.00mm,0.26mm,0.92mm,
2.12mm,3.14mm,4.52mm and6.04mm, and the sections
for the different rats were presented in randomized order
across groups (treated and controls) to the blind observers.
ImageJ software was used to measure the cross-sectional surface
area enclosed within the traced regions of interest on each
section. Lesion volumes (mm3) were then calculated using
Cavalieri’s principle (Cotter et al., 1999), and summed across
all regions of interest for each rat (to be referred to as ‘Voltotal
’ below). As previously detailed (Ejaz et al., 2015a), the
inter-rater agreement for lesion volume determination between
the two independent raters was excellent, indicating strong
reliability. Based on this, consensus regions of interest were
agreed.
PET data postprocessing
The basic procedures have been detailed previously (Hughes
et al., 2012) (Supplementary material).
Parametric images of 11C-PK11195 non-displaceable binding
potential (BP
ND
) were produced using the basis function version
of the simplified reference tissue model (Gunn et al.,
1997). The ipsilateral cerebellum, manually defined on a symmetric
spontaneously hypertensive rat MRI template (Hughes
et al., 2012) and inverse warped to each individual
T
2
-weighted MRI using SPM5 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm),
was used as the reference tissue (Gerhard et al., 2005; Price
et al., 2006). Each individual T
2
-weighted MRI was warped to
the MRI template using SPM5 and this transformation was
applied to the co-registered BP
ND
map to bring it to template
space for regional analysis. Note that this method may generate
negative BP
ND
values, which simply represent lower specific
binding than in cerebellum.
An automated method for data analysis was then applied to
the entire dataset without knowledge of the subjects’ group
until after statistical analysis was complete. To this end, regions
of interest delineated on the magnetic resonance template
were used to obtain 11C-PK11195 BP
ND
values from the BP
ND
maps (Fig. 3). The eight coronal cuts of the MRI template
matching as precisely as possible the eight Paxinos sections
used for the immunofluorescence image analysis were first selected.
Then, a set of 44 symmetrical regions of interest defined
according to Paxinos and Watson’s (1996) cytoarchitectonic
atlas covering the grey matter of the eight coronal sections
(per hemisphere: 39 cortical regions of interest, four caudate/
putamen regions of interest and one thalamic region of interest
) were used, as detailed previously (Ejaz et al., 2013;
Hughes et al., 2010, 2012). This region of interest template
was then projected onto the corresponding slices of the coregistered
BP
ND
maps to obtain the mean BP
ND
value for
each region of interest. Then, for each pair of symmetrical

regions of interest the (affected – unaffected) difference in
BP
ND
was calculated. A mean standard deviation (SD) (affected
– unaffected) BP
ND
difference across all 44 regions of
interest, weighted by the region of interest volume, was then
calculated for each rat and then across the six rats of each
group. Finally, we also computed the mean BP
ND
difference
for each region of interest across the six rats.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 15,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) software. The modified Sticky
Label Test data were analysed using one-way repeated measures
ANOVA within each group assessing the effects of Time,
followed if significant by Holm-Bonferroni post hoc tests corrected
for multiple tests to assess each time-point relative to
baseline. Then, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was
used to compare the NBO to the normoxic group, with
again post hoc tests if a significant difference emerged.
Regarding the PET data, the weighted mean BP
ND
(affected
– unaffected) difference within each group was compared to
neutral (i.e. zero, assuming no difference in PK11195 binding
between the two hemispheres) by paired t-test, and then the
two groups were compared using two-sample t-test. Also, the
weighted mean BP
ND
difference across the 44 regions of interest
for each rat was tested against neutral to determine individual
statistical significance. Finally, each region of interest’s
mean BP
ND
across the six rats was tested against neutral to
assess the particular region of interest’s statistical significance
within each group. Regarding the immunofluorescence data,
the presence of lesions on NeuN or IB4 was tested both
within- and between-groups using non-parametric tests, while
lesion volumes were tested using t-tests. Pearson’s correlation
coefficient was used to assess for relationships between modified
Sticky Label Test performance and NeuN- or IB4-labelled
lesion volumes. Results were considered statistically significant
if two-tailed P50.05.
Arterial PO
2
measurements
In addition to the above experiments, and to determine the
effects of NBO on PaO
2
levels, PaO
2
was measured in two
additional spontaneously hypertensive rats in both the normoxic
and hyperoxic conditions. PaO
2
was 121.5 mmHg
( 16; n= 9 measurements) and 478.5 mmHg ( 18; n=6)
in normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively, i.e. a 4-fold increase
during NBO. Corresponding values for SaO
2
were
98.7% ( 0.5%) and 100% ( 0%), respectively.
Results
All 12 rats entered in the study completed the protocol
without any complication or early death until the 28-day
termination.
MRI: Day 14
No DWI or T
2
-weighted changes were observed in any rat
(Fig. 5).
Neurological score and behavioural
testing
Neuroscore
The Neuroscore was zero, i.e. normal, in both groups at all
times, indicating no detectable neurological impairment.
Modified Sticky Label Test
The modified Sticky Label Test data and detailed statistical
findings are shown in Fig. 1. Following temporary MCA
occlusion, control animals demonstrated highly significant
(P50.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) impairment in
modified Sticky Label Test performance still present but
recovering at the last assessment at 28 days. In contrast,
NBO animals did not demonstrate any detectable modified
Sticky Label Test deficit (nil significant, repeated measures
ANOVA). Compared to controls, the NBO group was significantly
less impaired for all post-MCA occlusion timepoints
(P= 0.02). On post hoc tests, there was no significant
difference between the two groups at baseline, but the
performance was significantly better (P range: 0.045–0.015)
in the hyperoxia group for all time points until the end of
the experiment.
11C-PK11195: Day 14
In the control group, the individual weighted mean BP
ND
(affected – unaffected) difference ranged from +0.033 to
+ 0.074, with a mean of +0.052 0.015 (n =6), significantly
higher than neutral (t =6.054,P50.005). In the
hyperoxia group, the weighted mean BP
ND
(affected –
unaffected) difference ranged from + 0.018 to +0.075,
with a statistically significant weighted mean difference,
though less so than controls (+ 0.040 0.023; t =3.932,
P50.02), with no significant difference between the two
groups (t =1.078, P = 0.31). Figure 2 illustrates these
data.
When tested individually for a significant difference between
the two hemispheres, 5/6 rats were individually significant
in the control group versus 3/6 in the hyperoxia
group, again pointing to a small difference in favour of
NBO. Likewise, when testing individual regions of interest
for significant difference between the two hemispheres
across the six rats, 19/44 were significant in the control
group versus 4/44 in the hyperoxia group (located in the
insula and primary somatosensory area), a significantly
reduced proportion (P= 0.002; 2). Overall therefore,
there was significant though mild microglial activation in
the affected hemisphere in both groups at Day 14, with a
clear trend for reduced microglial activation in the hyperoxia
group.
Figure 3 illustrates typical 11C-PK11195 images in one
control and one hyperoxia rat, together with the corresponding
MRI and region of interest templates.

Immunofluorescence: Day 28
Abnormal areas were delineated by the two observers exclusively
in the MCA occlusion hemisphere. In the affected
hemisphere, areas showing loss of NeuN or high IB4 were
consistently topographically congruent and were present in
5/6 normoxic animals. In contrast, in NBO rats a very
small patch of absent NeuN binding was present in 1/6
rats, and increased IB4 areas in 0/6 rats. This difference
in occurrence of lesions between the two groups was statistically
different for IB4, and showed a trend for NeuN
(P= 0.015 and 0.08, respectively; Fisher’s test).
Regarding lesion volumes, the mean ( SD) Vol-Total
values for NeuN and IB4 in controls were 1.41 1.79
mm3 and 1.33 1.7 mm3, respectively, and 0.01 0.02
mm3 and 0.0 0.0 mm3 in NBO rats, respectively, a
highly significant difference from the control group
(P= 0.005 and 0.002 for NeuN and IB4, respectively).
Figure 4 illustrates these findings. Overall, therefore, these
results indicate a near-total and total lack of SNL and
microglial activation, respectively, at 28 days in the hyperoxia-treated
group.

impaired across the time course [F(1,4) = 13.5, P = 0.02]. On post hoc tests, there was no significant difference between the two groups at

both subjects.
Relationship between sensorimotor
scores and selective neuronal loss
To assess if the behavioural impairment in this model is
related to cortical SNL, we examined the relationship between
NeuN total lesion volume and modified Sticky Label
Test performance across the control and NBO groups
(n= 12 rats). There was a significant correlation between
NeuN Vol-Total data and peak modified Sticky Label Test
deficit, which was relatively weak ( = 0.47, P50.05) but
in the expected biological direction, i.e. a greater behavioural
deficit with greater neuronal loss (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Similar findings emerged for IB4 (data not shown).
Discussion
One strength of this proof-of-principle mechanistic study is
that each rat underwent an extensive protocol involving
serial sensorimotor assessments, Day 14 PET and full
post-mortem immunofluorescence, affording considerable
power. Accordingly, despite the relatively small samples,
the striking between-group differences in both tissue
damage and sensorimotor deficit seem beyond chance
finding.
This is the first study to document that, as per our hypothesis
, NBO applied during very brief MCA occlusion
mimicking ‘true’ TIA is able to almost completely prevent
selective neuronal death. Consistent with this neuronal protection
, NBO completely prevented the marked sensorimotor
deficits present in normoxic control rats. Regarding
microglial activation, another sequelae of ischaemic injury
that may have deleterious effects on brain function and
outcome independently of SNL (Terasaki et al., 2014), it
was partly prevented on Day 14 based on PET data, and
completely abolished at Day 28 based on post-mortem assessment
in the same subjects. This was confirmed post hoc
by lack of significant microglial activation on formal cell
counting in the four regions of interest showing significantly
increased PK11195 binding at Day 14 (data not
shown). Thus, in contrast to normoxic rats, the mild microglial
activation still present at Day 14 in NBO rats had
completely resolved on post-mortem at Day 28, indicating
NBO accelerated the expected post-injury resolution of
microglial activation. Such a mild and transient microglial

activation without SNL or sensorimotor counterpart in the
NBO-treated rats may be explained for instance by isolated
dendritic damage known to be present following brief
MCA occlusion (Tomimoto and Yanagihara, 1992;
Zhang et al., 2005). Overall, therefore, NBO was able to
almost entirely prevent both the tissue damage and sensorimotor
deficits characterizing control rats.
Before addressing our findings in detail, some methodological
points deserve a brief note. First, NBO increased
arterial PO
2
nearly 4-fold in our model, similar to data
reported by other groups (Kim et al., 2005; Beynon
et al., 2007; Fujiwara et al., 2009; Baskerville et al.,
2011; Sun et al., 2011). Second, we used spontaneously
hypertensive rats as this strain is particularly relevant to
the population at risk of TIA, because of chronic hypertension-related
cerebrovascular changes such as increased arteriolar
stiffness, impaired autoregulation and less efficient
pial anastomoses (Coyle and Heistad, 1986; Amenta et al.,
2010; Leoni et al., 2011). Because of these changes, spontaneously
hypertensive rats have higher vulnerability to
brain ischaemia (Coyle, 1986; Duverger and Mackenzie,
1988; McCabe et al., 2009; Letourneur et al., 2012), and
might therefore benefit more from NBO than their normotensive
counterparts. It will therefore be important to assess
whether NBO has the same beneficial effects in normotensive
rats as in spontaneously hypertensive rats in TIA
models. Third, that 11C-PK11195 PET was able to detect
in vivo the small, albeit highly significant, amount of microglial
activation present in this TIA model indicates it has
excellent sensitivity, expanding on our previous findings in
a 45min MCA occlusion model (Hughes et al., 2012).
Fourth, although PK11195 has affinity for activated astrocytes in vitro, this is5-fold lower than for microglial cells
(Banati, 2003), is hardly detectable on post-mortem brain
tissue (Banati et al., 1997; Venneti et al., 2009; Maeda
et al., 2011) including after focal ischaemia (Myers et al.,
1991; Stephenson et al., 1995; Rojas et al., 2011), and
seems even lower in vivo especially when using the R-enantiomer
as done here (Banati, 2003). Accordingly, most
authorities are of the opinion that in vivo 11C-PK11195
binding almost exclusively maps to activated microglia/
macrophages (Stephenson et al., 1995; Banati, 2003).
Partly unpublished data from our previous study comparing 11C-PK11195 to OX42 immunohistochemistry (a selective
microglial activation marker), both obtained 14
days following 45min MCA occlusion in spontaneously
hypertensive rats (Hughes et al., 2012), further support this
idea. Thus, 11C-PK11195 binding highly significantly
(r2= 0.656, P50.0001) correlated to OX42 staining density
, but less strongly so (r2= 0.541) to GFAP (a marker of
astrocytosis; both immunostains obtained from same subjects
and regions of interest), and the latter correlation was
not significant anymore (r2= 0.060, P= 0.115) after adjusting
for OX42 binding, indicating it was largely due to the
underlying strong OX42–GFAP topographical and statistical
relationship (r2= 0.646; conversely, the 11C-PK11195
versus OX42 correlation remained significant after adjusting
for GFAP: r2= 0.294, P50.0001). Taken together, all
of the above therefore strongly suggest that our findings of
increased 11C-PK11195 binding at Day 14 in both the
normoxic and hyperoxic rats almost exclusively reflect
microglial activation. Fifth, as detailed in the
Introduction, this was a pragmatic translational study designed
to test a simple and clinically-orientated question,
namely whether NBO is able to prevent the SNL and sensorimotor
impairment as well as the associated microglial
activation that characterize our rodent TIA model.
Accordingly, we did not investigate the whole spectrum
of potential tissue and behavioural changes, and specifically
cannot exclude that NBO may not for instance prevent
mild astrocytosis, damage to dendritic trees and/or subtle
cognitive impairment. Likewise, to quantitatively assess the
effects of NBO on SNL and microglial activation across the
ischaemic territory, we applied our previously validated
template of eight 0.9 mm-apart coronal sections covering
the MCA territory (Hughes et al., 2010, 2012; Ejaz
et al., 2013, 2015b), which based on independent visual
assessment by two experienced readers blinded to subject
group, disclosed a highly significant reduction in both SNL
and microglial activation in NBO-treated versus normoxic
rats. Again, we cannot exclude that some additional pathology
may have been present in intermediate slices.
However, post hoc assessment of intermediate coronal

slices revealed no additional SNL or microglial activation in
the treated rats, further supporting our findings.
To date, NBO has not gained widespread recognition as
a promising therapy for acute stroke. This likely relates to
the observation that in rodent models it does not invariably
result in significant infarct volume reduction and alleviation
of behavioural impairments, an impression reinforced by
the largely negative single pilot randomized clinical trial

higher magnification images of the inserts are also shown to illustrate the changes at finer resolution. While the MRI showed no changes in either
subject, immunofluorescence revealed typical patchy selective neuronal loss on NeuN staining and microglial activation on IB4 staining, affecting
the same cortical areas (arrows), in the normoxic rat; these appearances also affected most other coronal sections (not shown). No evidence of
SNL or microglial activation was present in the hyperoxic rat in this and other sections. The far right images in rows C and D represent the

of early NBO therapy, reporting transient clinical and imaging
improvements but no benefit on 3-month outcome
(Singhal et al., 2005, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2010).
Furthermore, the only other trial of NBO, the Stroke
Oxygen Supplementation Study, was also negative (Ali
et al., 2014; Roffe, 2014), although it has to be noted
that its aim was not to prevent acute damage but to compensate
for the hypoxic episodes that may occur in the first
days following stroke, and accordingly NBO was started
within 24h of onset and strokes of any type, including
haemorrhagic, were recruited. However, as will be seen
below, in-depth scrutiny of the literature in fact reveals
that the marginal overall benefit in rodent models is
partly due to heterogeneity of effects with duration of the
ischaemic insult. Thus, rather than adding to the confusion,
our strongly positive findings with a brief MCA occlusion
are largely consistent with the literature, and serve to emphasize
the key point that the benefits from NBO are to be
expected only in situations of rapidly occurring reperfusion.
Of the three studies that investigated the effects of NBO
on infarct volume in permanent MCA occlusion, two found
no significant effect (Singhal et al., 2002a; Kim et al., 2005)
and one a marginal though significant effect (Henninger
et al., 2007). Likewise, no consistently significant effect of
NBO was observed in rats subjected to 54h temporary
MCA occlusion (Kim et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2015),
which is considered equivalent in terms of infarct size to
permanent occlusion. Similarly, using an embolic MCA occlusion
model causing stable ischaemia, NBO started 30
min or 1h after occlusion did not reduce infarct size
(Fujiwara et al., 2009) or did so, but only marginally
(Henninger et al., 2009). In contrast with this universal
lack of significant benefit from NBO in permanent or
long-lasting occlusion, NBO showed equipoise in rats subjected
to 2 or 3h MCA occlusion, with three studies reporting
beneficial effects (Singhal et al., 2002b; Kim et al.,
2005; Henninger et al., 2007) and three no effect (Beynon
et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2015). Finally,
all six published studies with occlusion times of 60 to
90min reported significant infarct volume reductions, narrowly
ranging from 35 to 50% (Flynn and Auer, 2002;
Kim et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2007; Esposito et al., 2013;
Jin et al., 2013). Our study is the first to report the effects
of NBO for occlusion times560 min. That the effects were
near-complete in our model would be in line with the
above infarct volume reductions with MCA occlusion duration
of 60–90min. Interestingly, a similar dependence of
effects from hyperbaric oxygen therapy on MCA occlusion
duration has also been reported (Lou et al., 2004).
These benefits from NBO with transient MCA occlusion
43 h, and particularly490min, are in fact entirely consistent
with an extensive literature reporting strongly positive
effects of NBO on early markers of tissue hypoxia/
ischaemia. As already noted, in rodent MCA occlusion
models NBO has been shown to immediately and markedly
increase the very low tissue oxygen levels prevailing in the
penumbra in normoxic conditions (Liu et al., 2004, 2006;
Shin et al., 2007; Baskerville et al., 2011). Contrary to
previous beliefs, NBO does not induce vasoconstriction in
the ischaemic brain (Singhal et al., 2002a; Henninger et al.,
2007) and may even mildly improve penumbral perfusion
(Shin et al., 2007; Baskerville et al., 2011). Consistent with
these effects, NBO improves ATP stores (Sun et al., 2011),
‘freezes’ the perfusion/diffusion mismatch and DWI lesion
growth (Singhal et al., 2002a; Henninger et al., 2007), and
dampens ischaemic tissue acidosis (Sun et al., 2011), without
increasing oxidative stress or tissue levels of oxygen
radicals or metalloproteinase-9 (Singhal et al., 2002b;
Kim et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006). NBO also reduces the
frequency of peri-infarct depolarizations (Shin et al., 2007),
which strongly contribute to the demise of the penumbra.
Finally, consistent with our findings, Esposito et al. (2013)
reported that NBO reduced the expression of IBA1, a
marker of microglial activation, and improved sensorimotor
function 14 days after 100 min transient MCA
occlusion.
Our findings suggest that NBO administered from the
onset of a TIA, or by extension in subjects who recanalize
early after stroke onset—be it spontaneously or following
reperfusion therapy—could prevent or limit brain damage.
This contention is supported by findings from the previously
mentioned clinical trial that reported that, relative
to normoxia, NBO prevented initial DWI lesion growth
and occasionally resulted in lesion reversal; maintained
the DWI/PWI mismatch; and prevented early tissue lactate
rises, together with transient clinical improvement (Singhal
et al., 2005, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012).
That NBO did not result in long-term functional benefits in
this small-scale trial on patients not eligible for recanalization
therapies may result from the fact that none of the
nine NBO-treated patients spontaneously reperfused based
on a 4-h follow-up MRI (Singhal et al., 2005). As already
pointed out, therapies to ‘freeze’ the penumbra (Fisher and
Saver, 2015) can be truly beneficial only if reperfusion
occurs early enough (Fisher, 2011), and NBO is no exception
to this general rule.Whether SNL and microglial activation
are present in humans after a single true TIA is not
known, but both processes have been reported in acutely
penumbral but eventually surviving peri-infarct areas in
stroke patients enjoying early recanalization and good-toexcellent
clinical recovery (Price et al., 2006; Saur et al.,
2006; Guadagno et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2012; Carrera
et al., 2013). Furthermore, in such patients SNL was found
to effectively interfere with neuronal function in the chronic
stage (Carrera et al., 2013). Furthermore, cortical SNL
without associated magnetic resonance changes prevails in
patients with chronic symptomatic carotid or MCA occlusion
/severe stenosis (Yamauchi et al., 2007, 2009, 2011),
where TIAs are thought to be predominantly caused by
embolic events exacerbating permanent haemodynamic insufficiency
(Moustafa et al., 2010, 2011). Overall, our findings
are relevant to TIA and quickly recovering stroke, and
NBO could be an important new therapeutic approach in
this clinical scenario. In turn, by preventing subtle brain

damage, NBO could maintain the brain’s ‘cognitive reserve’
and reduce the risk of eventual cognitive decline in this
category of patients. Temporary (Pendlebury et al., 2011;
Sivakumar et al., 2014) or persistent (van Rooij et al.,
2014) cognitive deficits have been reported in TIA patients,
who appear particularly at risk of cognitive decline in the
longer term.
Regarding potential clinical translation, one major point
raised by our findings is: How early should NBO be started
after TIA onset? In the present proof-of-concept study, we
opted to start NBO as soon as the occlusion was completed
, in order to maximize any potential benefit from
this therapy. Although it is not unrealistic that, if properly
trained, patients at high risk of TIA or their relatives carry
a small oxygen bottle and use it at once in case a TIA
occurs, in the real world at least a few minutes would
elapse before oxygen therapy could be started.
Accordingly, it would be critical to assess in rodent TIA
models the effects of NBO started, for example, 5–10 min
post-MCA occlusion. Few studies have so far looked at the
effects of NBO as a function of time of administration.
Using a 2h MCA occlusion rat model, Singhal et al.
(2002a) reported declining benefits from NBO when started
at 30min post-MCA occlusion relative to 15min, and no
benefit if started at 45min. These findings not only emphasize
the importance of the timing of NBO but also indicate
that, consistent with our findings, the benefits from NBO in
the clinical setting are likely to be significant only if administered
within 45min of clinical onset, and the earlier the
larger the expected effects. Another point worth noting regarding
our study’s clinical implications regards the intravenous
administration of new-generation perfluorocarbons,
which are reported to enhance oxygen content within the
penumbra over and above NBO (Deuchar et al., 2013), as
well as reduce final infarct size if started immediately
(Woitzik et al., 2005) or 1h (Brown et al., 2014) after
permanent MCA occlusion (Seiffge et al., 2012), and
might therefore constitute an alternative or additional therapy
to NBO in future trials.
In the scenario of NBO administered at or soon after
stroke onset, however, the ischaemic or haemorrhagic
nature of the event is generally unknown, raising the question
whether NBO might be detrimental in case of haemorrhagic
stroke. This has been assessed in two rodent
studies, both showing no haematoma enlargement and no
increase, or even a decrease in peri-haematoma oedema and
blood–brain barrier disruption (Fujiwara et al., 2011; Zhou
et al., 2015). Likewise, if NBO is started soon after onset of
neurological deficit, it might be deleterious if continued into
the reperfusion stage, by e.g. enhancing oxidative stress or
haemorrhagic risk. However, one study has reported no
deleterious effects of NBO in this scenario (Singhal et al.,
2002b). Also, NBO started during the reperfusion phase
has not been found to have any deleterious effect
(Eschenfelder et al., 2008; Geng et al., 2013), and may in
fact be beneficial (Flynn and Auer, 2002). Finally, might
NBO interfere with t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator)
and/or increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation
and haematoma? In three studies, NBO did not interfere
with the beneficial effects of, and actually showed synergism
with t-PA in reducing infarct volumes (Fujiwara et al.,
2009; Henninger et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2015), while
also showing protective effects against the deleterious effects
of t-PA on the neurovascular unit including the
blood–brain barrier (Liang et al., 2015). Likewise,
Henninger et al. (2009) found no increase in haematoma
volume or petechial incidence in rats given both NBO and
t-PA in an embolic model, and two additional similar studies
found that NBO in fact reduced post-thrombolytic
intracerebral haemorrhage (Liu et al., 2009; Sun et al.,
2010). Thus, the safety profile of NBO seems reassuring
in most realistic clinical situations, although further studies
would be required to confirm this.
In conclusion, our findings document that NBO administered
during brief MCA occlusion in a clinically-relevant
rat model of ‘true’ TIA near-completely prevented neuronal
death and microglial inflammation as well as sensorimotor
impairment. Further studies using our model should assess
delayed NBO and NBO continued after reperfusion, rat
strains less vulnerable to ischaemia, and additional markers
of tissue damage and behavioural impairment. Taken together
with the available literature, our findings point to
NBO appearing extremely promising for brief MCA occlusions.
The particular attractiveness of NBO is its potential
clinically translatability as a straightforward adjunct to
reperfusion therapies, e.g. it could easily be administered
in the ambulance in acute-onset focal neurological deficits
suspected of stroke. Furthermore, patients at-high risk of
TIAs/stroke could be equipped and trained (or their relatives
) to immediately administer oxygen through a face
mask in case of acute-onset focal symptoms. Randomized
trials comparing the clinical and tissue outcome of subjects
starting NBO versus room air could ultimately test this
hypothesis.
