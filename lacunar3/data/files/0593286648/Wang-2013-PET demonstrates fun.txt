The purpose of this study was to determine the functionality of
the transplanted induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a rat model of cerebral ischemia
with use of 18F-FDG small-animal PET imaging.Methods: Middle
cerebral artery occlusion was used to establish cerebral ischemia.
Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups:
iPSC treatment, ESC treatment, and the control phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) injection. After neurologic function tests and
baseline 18F-FDG small-animal PET had been performed, 1.0 ·
106 suspended iPSCs or ESCs were injected stereotactically into
the left lateral ventricle. The treatment response was evaluated
weekly by 18F-FDG PET scans and neurologic function tests.
Histologic analyses and autoradiographic imaging were performed
4 wk after stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared
with the PBS injection group, higher 18F-FDG accumulation in the
ipsilateral cerebral infarction was observed in both the iPSC and
the ESC treatment groups during the 4-wk period (P, 0.05). 18FFDG
accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction increased
steadily over time in the iPSC treatment group. At 1 and 2 wk after
stem cell transplantation, significant recovery of glucose metabolism
was found in the ESC treatment group (P, 0.05) and then
decreased gradually. The neurologic score in both stem cell–
treated groups was significantly lower than that in the PBS
group, indicating functional improvement. Immunohistochemical
analysis demonstrated that transplanted stem cells survived
and migrated close to the ischemic region, and most of
the stem cells expressed protein markers for cells of interest.
Conclusion: 18F-FDG small-animal PET demonstrated metabolic
recovery after iPSC and ESC transplantation in the rat
model of cerebral ischemia. iPSCs could be considered a potentially
better therapeutic approach than ESCs and are worthy of
further translational investigation.

schemic stroke is the second leading cause of death in
industrialized countries (1). Current therapeutic strategies
to improve neural function such as pharmacotherapy, interventional
procedures, and surgery are limited because of the
inability to replace damaged or lost neural cells. Recently,
cell-based therapy using adult or embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
has provided hope for enhancing tissue repair and functional
recovery after ischemic stroke. In contrast to adult stem cells,
which lack the potency to differentiate into multiple functional
neural cell types, ESCs can give rise to many different types
of cells of the whole body and hold the greatest potential for
therapeutic applications. Over the past 10 y, although ESC
therapy has been confirmed for the improvement of neural
function in animal models (2,3), its clinical application
has been greatly limited because of the risk of immune
rejection and ethical controversy. Hence, it is necessary to
find an alternative source of pluripotent cells to replace
ESCs.
Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were
introduced as a new source of stem cells that can avoid the
risk of immune rejection and ethical issues. iPSCs can be
generated by transduction of defined transcription factors
from adult somatic cells through reprogramming (4) and 
have been differentiated in vitro into the early neural stem
cell stage or the neural lineage, including neurons and glial
cells (5–7). More recently, iPSCs have been applied to a variety
of nervous system disease models, including Parkinson
disease (8), spinal cord injury (9,10), and stroke (11–14), and
were found to improve neural function (11,13,15). However,
to better understand the in vivo behavior and efficacy of
iPSCs, a noninvasive, sensitive, and clinically applicable

approach for tracking the transplanted iPSCs and monitoring
the therapeutic responsein living subjects is warranted.
PET is one of the best-suited modalities to evaluate stem
cell therapy, since it can be used in patients clinically for both
cell trafficking and monitoring the response to therapy
(16,17). PET with 18F-FDG, a powerful tool with which to
study the etiopathogenesis and progression of neurologic
diseases, has recently been applied to detect the subtle changes
of glucose metabolism in vivo after stem cell therapy in various
neurologic disease models, including traumatic brain injury
(18), Parkinson disease (19–21), and Huntington disease
(22).
Although ESCs and iPSCs have been able to improve
functional recovery in the compromised central nervous 
system (18,21,22), no direct comparison had been made
of these 2 different cell types in a single animal model of
cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we wanted to directly compare
the therapeutic effect of ESCs and iPSCs. For that,
iPSCs and ESCs were transplanted into a rat model of cerebral
ischemia, and the metabolic recovery of the cerebral
infarction area was evaluated by 18F-FDG small-animal PET,
histologic analyses, and neurologic function tests.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Design and Animal Groups
Each of 24 adult Sprague–Dawley male rats (body weight,
240–270 g) was randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 experimental
groups (8 per group): the iPSC transplantation group, the
ESC transplantation group, and the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
injection group. All experimental animals underwent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO), and reperfusion was performed
90 min after MCAO. The stem cell transplantation or PBS injection
wasperformed3dafterreperfusion.Beforestemcelltransplantation
and at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 after cell transplantation, all
rats underwent neurologic function testing followed by 18F-FDG
small-animal PET scanning. Autoradiographic detection and immunohistochemical
staining were done after the last 18F-FDG smallanimal
PET scan (Supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental materials are
available online only at http://jnm.snmjournals.org).
All procedures associated with the care of animals were performed
according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (23) and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Induction of Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Animal preparation and induction of anesthesia for the MCAO
procedure and stem cell transplantation followed the institutional
guidelines and the advice of veterinary staff. Briefly, after initial
induction of anesthesia with a ketamine–xylazine mixture (a 60
mg/kg dose of ketamine plus a 10 mg/kg dose of xylazine, intraperitoneally
) (24), the rat was shaved, transported to the surgery
table in a dedicated surgery room, and fixed on the platform
with a warm pad (model 69001; RWD Life Science) to maintain
the body temperature throughout the procedure. The animal received
an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg) (24).
Focal brain ischemia was induced by the intraluminal suture technique.
The midline skin incision was made in the neck with subsequent
exploration of the left common carotid artery, the external
carotid artery, and the internal carotid artery. MCAO was achieved
by advancing a 3-0 monofilament nylon suture with a rounded tip to
the left internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until
slight resistance was felt. After 90 min of MCAO, reperfusion was
performed by withdrawal of the suture until the tip cleared the internal
carotid artery, and the wound was closed. The animals were
allowed to recover until awake and were returned to their cages. Rats
were treated for pain for the first 24 h after operation, by receiving
an injection of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously) every
8–12 h (25). More detailed postoperative care is described in the
supplemental data. The rats were housed 3 per cage in environmentally
enriched conditions under a 12-h light–dark cycle throughout
the experiments and were allowed free access to food and water.
Stem Cell Preparation
Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–labeled mouse
iPSCs and ESCs were cultured as described previously (4). Briefly,
mouse iPSCs and ESCs were maintained on a mitotically inactivated
(mitomycin C) (Roche) mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layer in
knockout Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Gibco) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10% knockout serum replacement
(Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen),·100 nonessential
amino acids (Invitrogen), ·1,000 b-2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen),
50 units of penicillin and a 50 mg/mL dose of streptomycin (Invitrogen
), and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (Invitrogen). Before
stem cell transplantation, iPSC and ESC colonies were passaged up
to 4 times without feeder cells on 60-mm culture dishes coated with
0.1% gelatin to eliminate contamination of the mouse embryonic
fibroblasts.
Transplantation Procedure
After all the rats had been prepared, they were placed in
a stereotactic instrument. A midline skin incision was made in the
skull, with subsequent drilling for a burr hole. About 1.0 · 106
suspended iPSCs, ESCs, or PBS was stereotactically injected into
the left lateral ventricle (0.9 mm anterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm
lateral to the midline, and 3.5 mm beneath the dura) in a volume of
20mL over 10 min with the use of a Hamilton microsyringe (26).
The needle was left in place for an additional 10 min and then
removed slowly. All surgical procedures were conducted under
aseptic conditions. Postoperative pain control and care were performed
as described in the section on the MCAO procedure.
Neurologic Function Tests
Testing of the Modified Neurologic Severity Score (mNSS) was
performed before and after MCAO; at 3 d (immediately before
stem cell transplantation); and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk after cell
transplantation by the same investigator, who was masked to the
experimental groups, as described previously (27). Neurologic
function was graded on a scale of 0–18 (05 normal score; 185
maximal deficit score). The mNSS is a composite of motor, sensory,
reflex, and balance tests. In the severity scores of injury, 1 score
point is awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of
a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the injury.
In Vivo PET Study and Image Analysis
At 3 d after reperfusion and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk after stem cell
transplantation, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and
injected with approximately 18.5 MBq (500mCi) of 18F-FDG via
the tail vein. At 40 min after 18F-FDG injection, the rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and positioned prone in the
microPET R4 scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions) for a 10-min
static acquisition with the mid skull in the center of the field of

view. The images were reconstructed with use of a modified backprojection
algorithm. 18F-FDG uptake was calculated as the percentage
injected dose per gram of tissue using the AMIDE software
package (version 9.2; Stanford University). In each image plane,
3-dimensional regions of interest 2 mm in diameter were drawn over
the infarcted area of the cerebral cortex and the contralateral normal
tissue, and the mean percentage injected dose per gram of tissue was
averaged. The lesion-to-normal homologous contralateral (L/N)
ratio was used for semiquantitative analysis. The L/N ratio was
calculated with use of the following formula: L/N ratio5 mean
counts per pixel of lesion region of interest/mean counts per
pixel of contralateral normal area. The average radioactivity concentration
within the infarcted area was obtained from the mean pixel
values, normalized to that of nonischemic cortex, and expressed as
a percentage.
Autoradiographic Imaging
Immediately after the last small-animal PET study, 6 animals
(2 per group) were decapitated under deep anesthesia; the brains
were removed rapidly into a rodent brain matrix and placed
into the cryostat (Bright Instrument Co. Ltd.) for about 60 min
at220C. Coronal brain slices (1-mm thick) were cut and kept
in contact with an imaging plate (BAS-IP MS 2040; Fujifilm)
for 20 min. The exposed plates were scanned with a bioimaging
analyzer (FLA-7000; Fujifilm), and the images were displayed
with a Dell computer (Image Reader FLA-7000, version 1.12;
Fujifilm) for qualitative evaluation.
Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescent
Staining
After the last small-animal PET scan, 18 animals (6 per group)
were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 200 mL of
4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer under deep anesthesia
(supplemental data). The brains were dissected and fixed in paraformaldehyde
for 6–8 h and then dehydrated with 30% sucrose in
0.1 M PBS for 2 d. The brains were frozen on powdered dry ice, and
then coronal sections (20mm thick) were processed with a cryostat
(Leica) at 20C throughout the entire ischemic damaged
brain.
For immunohistochemical staining, the sections were permeabilized
with 0.04% Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% normal
goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and
then treated overnight at 4C with primary antibodies: Rabbit
polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(1:300 dilution; Abcam), mouse monoclonal antibody against neuronal
nuclei (NeuN) (1:200 dilution; clone: A60, Millipore), or rabbit
polyclonal antibody against von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1:200
dilution; DAKO). The sections were washed 3 times in PBS for
10 min each and incubated in biotinylated secondary antiserum
(Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Lab) for 30 min at room temperature.
The sections were rinsed and incubated in ABC reagents (Vectastain
ABC kit) for 30 min and then washed thoroughly and incubated in
0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.03% H
2
O
2
for 3–5 min until
a brown reaction product was observed.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed to determine
whether transplanted stem cells can induce neurogenesis and angiogenesis.
NeuN was used as a mature neuronal marker, GFAP as the
mature astrocyte marker, and vWF as the endothelial cell marker.
We counted the number of cells positively stained with NeuN or
vWF and calculated the mean values and SDs. The number of
positively stained cells with NeuN or vWF in 3 different microscopic
fields (·200 magnification) was calculated. To evaluate the average
integral optical density (IOD) of GFAP, the hot spots of the section
were selected with the use of a microscope (·100 magnification).
Individual counts were then made in ·200 fields (BX60; Olympus).
Sections (3 microscopic fields per slice, 1 slice per animal) were
digitized with the use of a camera. The IOD of GFAP was obtained
using Image-ProPlus 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics).
To follow up on the fate of EGFP-labeled transplanted cells,
some sections were processed for immunofluorescent analysis of
the cell implants. Sections were blocked and incubated overnight
at 4C with primary antibodies as mentioned above; the dilution of
all primary antibodies was 1:100. After washes in PBS, sections
were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 568, 1:500; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.
Sections were washed and counterstained with the nuclear dye 4,6-
diamino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence-labeled sections were viewed
with use of a confocal microscope (Olympus).
Statistical Analyses
The data were expressed as mean6 SD. A difference between
groups was considered statistically significant if the P value was
less than 0.05. The Studentttest was used to compare body weight
between treatment group and control group after MCAO. ANOVA
was used when the groups numbered 3. Statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS software (version 15.0, SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS
Neurologic Assessment After iPSC and
ESC Transplantation
To determine whether the transplantation of iPSCs and
ESCs can improve sensorimotor deficit in ischemic brain
injury, neurologic tests were performed and compared with
each other by the same investigator, who was masked to the
experimental groups (8 per group at each time point). No
significant differences in mNSS scores were detected among
the 3 experimental groups at 3 d after reperfusion (immediately
before stem cell transplantation). The mNSS scores
in the iPSC and ESC groups, starting 1 wk after reperfusion,
were significantly lower at each time point than were those
of the PBS group (P, 0.05). At each time point, no significant
differences in mNSS scores were detected between the
iPSC group and the ESC group (P. 0.05). These results
suggested that transplantation of iPSCs and ESCs improved
neurologic function recovery (Fig. 1).
18F-FDG PET Evaluation
To document that a stem cell implant corresponds to
enhanced glucose metabolic activity, the rats were studied
by 18F-FDG small-animal PET. The 18F-FDG PET scans
allowed the visualization and quantification of glucose metabolism
throughout the brain at each time point (Fig. 2A).
Semiquantitative measurement of 18F-FDG radioactivity in
the ischemic area demonstrated no significant differences in
the L/N ratio among the 3 experimental groups at 3 d after
reperfusion (immediately before stem cell transplantation)
(Fig. 2B). However, the L/N ratios were significantly increased
in both the iPSC-treated and the ESC-treated
groups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk after stem cell transplantation
(P, 0.001), indicating that transplantation of iPSCs and
ESCs increased glucose metabolism in the cerebral ischemic

area. Furthermore, in the ESC-treated group, the L/N ratio
increased the most at 1 wk after transplantation and was significantly
higher at that time than that of the iPSC-treated
group (P, 0.05); after that, the ratio decreased gradually
until it became lower than that of the iPSC-treated group
at 4 wk after transplantation (P, 0.05). At 3 wk after stem
cell transplantation, no significant difference was found between
the ESC-treated group and the iPSC-treated group
(P5 0.97).
In addition, there was no focal abnormal increase in
glucose metabolism in the cerebral ischemic area, thus indicating
no tumor or teratoma formation at 4 wk after stem cell
transplantation.
Autoradiographic Imaging
The autoradiographic results demonstrated that the level
of 18F-FDG radioactivity detected was similar to that
detected by 18F-FDG small-animal PET in the same brain
regions, as expected. Also as expected, activity distribution
was similar but not identical (because of technical
and physical differences) (Fig. 3), indicating a significant
correlation between in vivo small-animal PET images
and in vitro autoradiographic measurements.
Immunohistochemical Findings
Immunohistochemical studies were performed to determine
whether transplanted stem cells can induce neurogenesis
and angiogenesis. NeuN was used as a mature neuronal
marker, GFAP as the mature astrocyte marker, and vWF
as the endothelial cell marker. We counted the number of
NeuN or vWF cells immunostaining positively and calculated
the meanvalues and SDs. In the iPSC-treated animals, the 
number of NeuN-positive cells was significantly higher than
that in the PBS-injected group (56.56 13.88 vs. 36.75 6
2.06; P, 0.05) and was higher than that in the ESC-treated
group, but not to a statistically significant extent (56.5 6
13.88 vs. 45.886 7.64; P5 0.138). There was no statistically
significant difference between the ESC-treated group
and the PBS-injected group (45.886 7.64 vs. 36.756 2.06;
P5 0.195) (Fig. 4). The number of vWF-positive cells in
both the iPSC-treated group and the ESC-treated group was
significantly higher than that in the PBS-injected group
(10.56 1.29 vs. 7.386 1.38 [P5 0.022] and 106 1.31
vs. 7.38 6 1.38 [P 5 0.046], respectively). However,
there was no statistically significant difference between
the iPSC-treated group and the ESC-treated group (10.56
1.29 vs. 106 1.31; P5 0.67) (Fig. 5).
The IOD of GFAP in the iPSC-transplanted group was
significantly higher than that in either the ESC-transplanted
group (4,552.25 6 401.85 vs. 3,322.59 6 352.73; P 5
0.001) or the PBS-injected group (4,552.256 401.85 vs.
2,600.91 6 363.04; P , 0.001). Meanwhile, the IOD of
GFAP in the ESC-transplanted group was significantly
higher than that of the PBS-injected group (3,322.59 6
352.73 vs. 2,600.916 363.04; P5 0.023) (Fig. 6).
Four weeks after transplantation, tracing of EGFP-
labeled cells showed that the transplanted cells survived
and integrated into the area close to the infarction. Double
labeling of EGFP with NeuN, GFAP, or vWF showed that
most of the grafted cells were NeuN1,GFAP 1, or vWF1,
which indicated the differentiation of iPSCs and ESCs into
mature nerve cells (astrocytes and neurons) and angiogenic
cells in vivo (Fig. 7).

Moreover, we did not observe nonneuronal or noncortical 18F-FDG–avid tissue formation (tumor or teratoma
) in the transplant recipients at 4 wk after iPSC and
ESC transplantation.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the potential therapeutic effects of iPSCs
and ESCs were evaluated and compared by serial 18F-FDG
small-animal PET scans combined with 2 other complementary
approaches: neurologic function testing and immunohistochemical
examination. To the best of our knowledge, this
was the first study to use serial 18F-FDG PET to evaluate the
metabolic recovery of cerebral ischemia in rats after iPSC
treatment. By using a rat model of cerebral ischemia, we
were able to find increased glucose metabolic activity in
the cerebral infarction area and improved neurologic function
during the 4-wk period after iPSC and ESC transplantation.
Immunohistologic analysis also confirmed the excellent
survival of iPSCs and ESCs in these animals at 4 wk after
stem cell transplantation. We observed that iPSCs and
ESCs migrated to the area close to the infarction, where they
expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, the mature
astrocyte marker GFAP, and the endothelial cell marker vWF.
In this study, serial 18F-FDG PET was used to evaluate
cerebral glucose metabolism after iPSC and ESC treatment.
Compared with the PBS control group, the higher 18F-FDG
accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction was
observed in both the iPSC and the ESC treatment groups
at 1–4 wk after stem cell transplantation. In earlier stages
(at 1 and 2 wk after stem cell transplantation), significantly
better metabolic recovery was found in the ESC treatment
group, but in later stages (from 3 wk after transplantation),
the iPSC treatment group had higher 18F-FDG accumulation
than did the ESC group. These results indicated that iPSCs
and ESCs transplanted into the brain might have improved
the rats’ recovery from experimental cerebral ischemia. Most

interestingly, the iPSC-treated group demonstrated steadily
increasing 18F-FDG accumulation during the 4-wk period,
whereas the ESC group showed higher accumulation only in
the earlier stage, indicating that iPSC treatment may produce
a more stable therapeutic response than that of the ESC group.
What are the mechanisms or factors that promote reduced
deficits with iPSC and ESC transplantation after stroke? One
possibility is that the transplanted stem cells integrate into the
tissue, replace damaged cells, and reconstruct the neural
circuitry. In the present study, immunohistochemical analyses
indicated that many transplanted cells survived and integrated
close to the ischemic region and that most of the cells
expressed protein markers for parenchymal cells. Quantitative
analyses revealed that the numbers of neurons, astrocytes, and
endothelial cells were higher in the iPSC treatment group
than in the ESC treatment group, as was consistent with the
recovery of glucose metabolism in cerebral infarction
evaluated by our 18F-FDG PET scan. These changes indicate
that iPSC transplantation–induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis
play an important role during recovery.
Another reasonable explanation is that changes in the
microenvironment may contribute to tissue protection and
repair (28) or that the interaction of grafted stem cells with
the host brain may lead to production of trophic factors
(29). Previous reports demonstrated that transplantation
of human microglial cells into the ischemic brain induced
a significant upregulation in expression of glial cell line–
derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth
factor in the ischemic penumbra (30). The presence of upregulated
glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor and vascular
endothelial growth factor in the rat brain might be an explanation
for the neuronal recovery because those factors can support
neuronal survival and attenuate neuronal apoptotic death (31).
The reason for the neuronal recovery remains elusive, but
various factors including the apoptotic signal pathway,
necrosis, and the repair process may affect it. A few studies
have reported that transplantation of gene-modified stem
cells overexpressing glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor
, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or vascular endothelial
growth factor after cerebral ischemia reduced infarct volume
and ameliorated neurologic deficits (32–34). However,
whether the iPSCs and ESCs themselves function in this
way, or whether their differentiated cells have the corresponding
functions, needs to be further investigated.
Despite the clear advantages of pursuing iPSC technology
, ESCs remain the only pluripotent cells that can be
considered genetically unmodified and still hold the greatest
potential for useful therapeutic applications. This is why
we used ESCs as the gold standard in terms of pluripotency
in the present study. In addition, there are several
similar properties between iPSCs and ESCs, such as their
morphology, self-renewal, differentiation capacity, and
cell surface antigens (35).
However, there are still differences between the 2 cell
types, such as their gene expression profiles. Studies have
identified more than 1,200 gene differences between iPSCs
and ESCs (36). Another report demonstrated that residual
gene expression of the donor cell type contributes significantly
to the differences between human iPSCs and human
ESCs (37). The time course during neuroectodermal differentiation
was also different in iPSCs and ESCs. For example,
2 recent studies compared the capacity of human iPSCs and
human ESCs to differentiate into neural cells (neurons and
glia) and found that iPSC-derived neural cells had greater
variation and lower efficiency in neuronal differentiation.
However, once iPSCs were specified to a neural lineage, they
could be differentiated to form motor neurons with efficiency
similartothatofhumanESCs( 6,38).
Until now, only a few studies have directly compared the
efficacy of treatment for cerebral ischemia between iPSCs
and ESCs. In the present study, we directly compared these
2 types of stem cells and found differences in the recovery
of glucose metabolism and in neurogenesis and angiogenesis
that were induced by iPSC and ESC transplantation.
However, whether the metabolic and functional changes
observed in this study resulted from the neurologic differentiation
in vivo between iPSCs and ESCs in the different time
courses remains unclear and needs to be determined in future
studies.
The present study had several limitations. One was that
the study was performed for only 4 wk after stem cell
transplantation. We therefore could not form conclusions
about longer-term therapeutic response after iPSC transplantation
, including potential tumor formation, although
we did not find any tumor formation in this study. The second
limitation is that we did not use the direct cell labeling or
transgenic cell labeling technique to track the transplanted
stem cells. However, direct monitoring of metabolic recovery
by 18F-FDG PET did have certain advantages. For example,
it did not interfere with the normal stem cell potential for
life, and this technique can easily be translated and applied

GFAP-positive cells (brown cells) in cerebral ischemic region in
iPSC-treated and ESC-treated animals or PBS-injected animals.
IOD of GFAP was significantly higher in both iPSC-transplanted
and ESC-treated groups. IOD of GFAP was also higher in iPSC-
transplanted animals than in ESC-treated animals.

widely in clinical practice. The third limitation is that complete
kinetic modeling has not been performed to confirm
the true dynamic of glucose metabolism after injection of
18F-FDG. This modeling should be conducted in the further
investigations.
CONCLUSION
Serial 18F-FDG small-animal PET demonstrated metabolic
recovery after iPSC and ESC transplantation in a rat
model of cerebral ischemia. iPSCs can be considered a potentially
better therapeutic approach than ESCs and are
worthy of further translational investigations.
