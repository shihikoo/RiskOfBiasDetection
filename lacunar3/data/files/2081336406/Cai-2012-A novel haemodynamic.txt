Cerebral aneurysms of traditional animal models are usually too small to be imaged in vivo. A novel rat
model induced by ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery and contralateral pterygopalatine and
external carotid arteries was investigatid. To evaluate the morphological changes of the cerebral arteries,
synchrotron radiation angiography was utilised at 1 month, 2 months and 3 months after induction.
Cerebral aneurysms and expansion of anterior cerebral arteries in these rats were identified when the
animals were alive. This novel model is useful for cerebral aneurysm research.

1. Introduction
The most widely used experimental cerebral aneurysm (CA) rat
model was reported by Hashimoto et al.,1 which was induced by
unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery (CCA) and bilateral
ligation of the posterior renal arteries. The aneurysms produced by
this model were morphologically similar to human saccular cerebral
aneurysms,2 and were primarily analysed with terminal
modalities (pathological evaluation and scanning electron microscope
mapping).3–5 However, the small size of these aneurysms
rendered this model inappropriate for testing endovascular intervention
,6 and Hoshimoto et al.’s model has not yielded sufficient
information on the formation, development and rupture of CA.
The morbidity and mortality of this disease has necessitated the
development of a CA model that can be detected and observed
in vivo.
We designed a haemodynamic model in rats based on Hashimoto
et al.’s model that overcame some disadvantages of the previous
model.
2. Materials and methods
All animal procedures were approved by the institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Sprague-Dawley rats (15 male, 8 weeks old) were used. The animals
were anaesthetised using an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine
(100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A heating pad (RWD Life Science
; Shenzhen,China) was used to maintain animal temperature at
37.0 ± 0.5C. After anaesthesia, the rats were placed in a supine position
, and a midline incision was made on the neck under an operating
microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). The right CCA and
external carotid artery (ECA) were isolated and the ECA was ligated
and dissected. Then, the right pterygopalatine artery (PPA) was exposed
, isolated and ligated. Finally, the left CCA was isolated and ligated
(Fig. 1a). After waking, all animals had free access to food and
water until synchrotron radiation angiography (SRA). The rats were
divided equally and randomised into three groups of five rats each
(1-month, 2-month, 3-month) for SRA.
At 1 month, 2 months and 3 months after induction, systolic
blood pressures of the rats in each group were measured with an
automatic sphygmomanometer (Softron, Tokyo, Japan) using the
tail cuff technique while the animals were restrained, and compared
to the blood pressures of same-age normal rats (n= 5). At
these times, the rats from each group (five, four, four rats, respectively
) were then transferred to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation
Facility (SSRF) for SRA and the images were compared to
normal rats (n= 5). SSRF is a newly established third-generation
synchrotron radiation (SR) light source with an accelerator of
3.5 GeV.7,8 After anaesthesia, a midline incision was made on the
neck under an operating microscope and a PE-10 tube was inserted
into the right CCA. After catheterisation, rats were placed on their
sides, vertical to the SRA beam and a 13-lm-resolution chargecoupled
device (CCD) camera (Photonic-Science, East Sussex, UK)
(Fig. 1b). A contrast medium, non-ionic iodine (Omnipaque; GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) was injected into the cerebral
circulation through the PE-10 tube. The injection speed and

volume of iodine were controlled by an injecting pump at 3 mL/
min and 150lL (Baoding Longer Precision Pump, Baoding, China).
After the SRA images were collected, the Image-Pro Plus program
6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to measure
the diameter of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) at the bifurcation
of the ACA and the olfactory artery (OA). The diameter of the ACA
of same-age normal rats subjected to SRA (n= 5) was also measured
and compared to CA rats. For catheterisation of normal rats,
a PE-10 tube was inserted into the ECA and advanced until reaching
the bifurcation of the ECA and internal carotid artery (ICA).
After SRA, the rats in each group and their controls were incised
to expose the right atrium and perfused through the left cardiac
ventricle with 50 mL physiological saline, followed by 50 mL of
Microfil (Flow Tech, MA, USA). Four hours after perfusion, the
brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h.
The brains were examined with a stereomicroscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany) and a Micro-XCT scanner (Xradia, CA, USA).
The means ± standard errors of the means of the blood pressures
and ACA diameters of CA model rats and normal rats were
compared at each sampling time by a paired t-test using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences software version 16.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). A p< 0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
There were no significant differences between the blood pressures
of the CA rats in each group and normal rats (p> 0.05). After
CA induction one rat in the 2-month group died on day 47
(unknown cause), and one rat in the 3-month group died on day
72 from a blood clot on the basal cerebrum.
A typical SRA image of the major cerebral arteries around the
circle of Willis in a normal rat is displayed inFig. 2a. The SRA technique
revealed three rats with CA in the CA model groups (one
from the two-month group and two from the 3-month group) as
well as changes in the cerebral arteries in all rats from the CA model
groups. A CA located in the right ACA of a rat in the 3-month
group was identified with SRA imaging, stereomicroscope observation
and Micro-XCT scanning techniques (Fig. 2b–d). The changes
in ACA diameters in the CA and normal groups are shown inFig. 2e.
4. Discussion
The PPA of a normal rat (Fig. 2a) is larger than the ICA, and
therefore we postulated that blood flow in the PPA was greater
than that in the ICA. Therefore, unilateral ligation of the ECA and
PPA and contralateral CCA would significantly increase the blood
flow of cerebral circulation through the remaining ICA. The PPA
could not be exposed and isolated without ipsilateral ligation
and dissection of the ECA (Fig. 1a). The changes of diameter in
the ACA (Fig. 2e) suggested that the blood flow of the cerebral circulation
notably increased after induction of the CA model.
Hashimoto et al. reported an experimental CA rat model in
1978,1 which has been the most widely used CA model. Unilateral
ligation of the CCA was the haemodynamic model. To induce

secondary hypertension, the posterior renal arteries were ligated
bilaterally, and the animals were fed with 1% saline water.9 In
addition, to make vessels fragile, b-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)
was introduced.10 Bilateral ligation of the posterior renal arteries
plus ingestion of saline water and toxic BAPN inevitably increased
complications and mortality in this model. By avoiding bilateral
ligation of the posterior renal arteries and the altered diet, we believed
that the techniques we used to induce CA were simpler and
safer. However, two rats died after induction. We believe that the
rat with a blood clot on the basal cerebrum died from a CA rupture
and that the other rat died of cerebral ischemia or another unknown
cause.
Saccular CA is extremely rare in animals.10 In this study, saccular
cerebral aneurysms in one rat from the 2-month group and two
rats from the 3-month group were revealed with SRA when the
animals were alive. Therefore, our model is useful for CA research.
Synchrotron radiation (SR) is a unique tool to visualise pathophysiological
changes of small arteries.11 SRA, however, is an invasive

technique involving high doses of radiation, and in particular,
catheterisation using a PE-10 tube into the only CCA–ICA for angiographic
imaging is likely to result in death of the experimental animal.
In the near future, we will perform SRA using intravenous
injection, which is routinely applied in CT angiography and magnetic
resonance angiography. With the development of irradiation-proofing
, the radioactivity of SR at SSRF will become
tolerable for use on humans as conducted by the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility.12
5. Conclusion
This novel CA model in rats with unilateral ligation of the CCA
and the contralateral PPA and ECA is useful for CA research.
