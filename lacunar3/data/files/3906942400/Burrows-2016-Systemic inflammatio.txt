Reperfusion after stroke is critical for improved patient survival and recovery and can be achieved clinically
through pharmacological (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or physical (endovascular intervention)
means. Yet these approaches remain confined to a small percentage of stroke patients, often with incomplete reperfusion
, and therefore there is an urgent need to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the no-reflow
phenomenon that prevents restoration of adequate microvascular perfusion. Recent evidence suggests systemic
inflammation asanimportant contributortono-reflowand tofurther investigatethishere we inject interleukin 1
(IL-1) i.p. 30 min prior to an ischaemic challenge using a remotefilament to occlude the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) in mice. Before, during and after the injection of IL-1 and occlusion we use two-dimensional optical imaging
spectroscopy to record the spatial and temporal dynamics of oxyhaemoglobin concentration in the cortical
areas supplied by the MCA. Our results reveal that systemic inflammation significantly reduces oxyhaemoglobin
reperfusion as early as 3 h afterfilament removal compared to vehicle injected animals. CD41 immunohistochemistry
shows a significant increase of hyper-coagulated platelets within the microvessels in the stroked
cortex of the IL-1 group compared to vehicle. We also observed an increase of pathophysiological biomarkers
of ischaemic damage including elevated microglial activation co-localized with interleukin 1α(IL-1α), increased
blood brain barrier breakdown as shown by IgG infiltration and increased pyknotic morphological changes of
cresyl violet stained neurons. These data confirm systemic inflammation as an underlying cause of no-reflow
in the post-ischaemic brain and that appropriate anti-inflammatory approaches could be beneficial in treating
ischaemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality with
treatment options limited to reperfusion through thrombolysis or
thrombectomy. Ischaemic stroke accounts for 85% of all human strokes
and is mainly caused by occlusion of themiddle cerebralartery (MCA), a
major arterial branch supplying blood to the brain (Doyle et al., 2008,
Lloyd, 2010; Rosamond, et al., 2008). The resulting occlusion results in
hypoperfusion of brain tissue creating an energy depleted state within
the infarct core, triggering acute pathophysiological processes which
result in neuronal injury (Ankolekar et al., 2012, Cramer et al., 2003,
Semenza, 2009). Hypoperfusion starves tissue of glucose resulting in
neuronal dysfunction and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(Mori et al., 1992, Vila et al., 2000). Future successful treatment of
ischaemic stroke requires a comprehensive understanding of the
pathophysiological changes that occur within the acute phase of cerebral
ischaemia.
Despite promising results in experimental studies of stroke in animal
models there has been a lack of translation to clinical success (Ankolekar
et al., 2012, Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b). Pre-clinical studies of ischaemic
stroke to date have largely failed to take into account relevant
co-morbidities for stroke, which experimentally we have shown can
dramatically exacerbate ischaemic injury (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b,
McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, McColl, 2008). A key hallmark of stroke
co-morbidities is systemic inflammation and it is now well accepted
that inflammatory processes are a major contributor to cerebral ischaemia
(Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, McColl,
2009; McColl, 2008; McColl et al., 2010; Maysami et al., 2015). The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in particular has been identified as a key mediator of neuronal injury. Experimental models of stroke
have found that IL-1 signalling on endothelial cells, microglia, astrocytes
and neutrophils stabilizes mRNA for pro-inflammatory mediator expression
(Brandolini et al., 1997, Ericsson et al., 1995). Furthermore IL-1 acts
on cerebral microvasculature endothelial cells, upregulating adhesion
molecule expression and subsequent neutrophil transmigration
(Brandolini et al., 1997). IL-1 has also been shown as the main driver in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated worsening of damage (Denes et al.,
2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b). Recentfindings demonstrate

that systemic IL-1 prevents microvascular reperfusion post-stroke
through endothelin-dependent mechanisms (Murray et al., 2013). Furthermore
we have previously shown that preceding pneumonia infection
worsens stroke outcome via IL-1 and platelet dependent
mechanisms (Denes et al., 2014). Patients with underlying
inflammation-related co-morbidities for stroke, including obesity, diabetes
, arthritis and smoking often have worse outcomes following a cerebral
ischaemic event (Bottcher and Falk, 1999; Herz et al., 2015, Pinto
et al., 2004). In human trials IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) limits
the action of IL-1, improving patient outcome by reducing the pathophysiological
activity including reduction in neutrophil numbers
(Emsley, et al., 2005; Emsley et al., 2008, Smith et al., 2004). Therefore
we have identified IL-1 as a very relevant cytokine to co-administer
with cerebral ischaemia. Despite these data supporting a key role of IL-
1 in ischaemic brain injury it remains to be fully defined how IL-1 affects
reperfusion post-stroke. To investigate this further we combine systemic
administration of IL-1 with a remotefilament model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) (Burrows et al., 2015), using two-dimensional
optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS), to confirm the effects of IL-1 on
cortical oxyhaemoglobin dynamics during reperfusion after stroke in
mice.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals
All animal procedures were performed under an appropriate Home
Office Licence and adhered to regulations as specified in the Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Studies were performed in accordance
with ARRIVE guidelines, with appropriate randomisation and
blinding procedures in place, and ethical approval by the local ethics
committee of the University of Manchester. Mice were kept at 21 °C
and 65% humidity with a regulated12-h light–dark cycle and free access
to food and water. Twenty-nine male C57/BL6 mice (Harlan Laboratories
, UK) weighing between 30 and 36 g (age 18 to 25 weeks) were
used in this study. Ten C57/BL6 male mice underwent i.p. injection of
20 ng/kg mouse recombinant IL-1β (R&D systems, UK) in sterile PBS
and 0.5% low endotoxin BSA, 30 min prior to a 30 min MCAo with 6 h
reperfusion; the remaining ten mice underwent i.p. injection of sterile
PBS with 0.5% low endotoxin BSA alone (vehicle), 30 min prior to a
30 min ischaemic insult with 6 h reperfusion. In addition four C57/BL6
mice underwent the IL-1 protocol andfive C57/BL6 mice underwent
the vehicle protocol but were sacrificed 10 min after removal of the
MCAofilament (i.e. 70 min after injection) for further immunohistochemical
analysis. Though IL-1βwas injected in the interest of brevity
the rest of the manuscript will simply refer to IL-1.
2.2. Remotefilaments
Filament preparation was performed as described in (Burrows et al.,
2015) producing 5 cm remotefilaments with a Xantopren M Mucosa
and Activator NF Optosil (Heraeus, GER) mix for tip coating, first
described by (Engel et al., 2011). A 2 cm length of clear i.v. catheter
tubing (Portex, Kent UK) was used to aid stability during insertion of
thefilament.
2.3. Surgical preparation
Anaesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane (Abbott, Berkshire, UK)
in room air. Once the animals were unconscious with lack of pedal
reflex, they were maintained under 2% isoflurane via a face mask for
surgery and, once a tracheal cannula had been inserted, 1% to 1.5%
isoflurane for the remainder of the experiment. MCAo was performed
by advancing the custom madefilament through the external carotid
artery (ECA) up to the internal carotid artery to a point just before the
MCA branch (Burrows et al., 2015). For imaging experiments, animals
were fixed in a stereotactic frame (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with ear
bars, mouth bar and a dorsal head post to prevent movement. Animals
were artificially ventilated with 1% to 1.5% isoflurane in room air via
a Zoovent Jetsys ventilator (Universal Lung Ventilators Ltd., Milton
Keynes, UK). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C via a heating
blanket controlled with a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK),
and the heart rate was monitored via ECG throughout the experiment.
The scalp was dissected down the midline to expose the skull. The
bone over the area of the somatosensory cortex supplied by the MCA
in the stroked hemisphere was kept translucent with a saline filled
paraffin well closed by a circular cover slip.
2.4. Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy
Two-dimensional spectroscopic imaging data were collected
through the imaging window over the intact skull using a high signalto-noise
charged coupled device (CCD) camera (Pantera 1M30, DALSA,
Munich, Germany). The region of interest was illuminated sequentially
by four different wavelengths of light (550 ± 10 nm, 560 ± 10 nm,
577 ± 10 nm, and 700 ± 10 nm) using a Lambda DG-4 high-speedfilter
changer (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Camera data collection
was synchronized with the filter changer so that each image frame
was recorded with one of the four different cortical illumination wavelengths
in a sequential manner at a rate of 28 Hz. A ceramic attenuator
(PI Instruments, Bedford, UK) was attached to a single whisker on the
right whisker pad to enable computer-controlled mechanical stimulation
of the barrel cortex throughout the experiment. A single imaging
experiment consisted of a continuous recording of 30 trials. Each trial
was 16 s long and contained a 4-s pre-stimulus period; 4 s of 8 Hz
mechanical whisker stimulation and an 8-s recovery time. These 8-min
experiments were recorded before injection, post injection, during, and
after MCAo for both experimental groups as shown inFig. 1.
2.5. Imaging protocol
A region of interest (ROI) for imaging was chosen to include the
main branches of the MCA and the barrel cortex as identified by
localized functional activity from mechanical whisker stimulation.
Three sets of trials were recorded for baseline comparison after
which the animals underwent i.p. injection with 20 ng/kg IL-1β or vehicle
treatment (Fig. 1). Post injection of IL-1β or vehicle, a further
three sets of trials were recorded during the 30 min prior to filament
advancement. Then the remotefilament was advanced ~2 to 4 mm to
induce a 30 min occlusion of the MCA. During the MCAo three further
trials were recorded. The remote filament was then retracted
back 6 mm to allow full reperfusion of the MCA. Trials were then recorded
every 30 min for 6 h after reperfusion. After 6 h reperfusion,
the animal was transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution
containing 0.5% sodium nitrate followed by 2% paraformaldehyde
solution. After fixing, the brain was removed, stored in 2% paraformaldehyde
for 24 h and submerged in a 30% sucrose solution for a
further 24 h.
2.6. Tissue processing
Coronal brain sections(30μm thick) were cut on a sledge microtome
(Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) with freezing stage (Bright Instruments,
Huntingdon, UK). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution (30%
ethylene glycol and 20% glycerol (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) in phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS)) at−20 °C, before histological staining.
2.7. Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections were pre-mounted on charged slides (Fisher Scientific
, USA) before antigen-retrieval, where slides were submerged in
citrate buffer (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in distilled water or 10%

(Sigma, UK) in PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for IL-1 staining. A 1 h blocking
step was performed using 2% of normal donkey or rabbit serum (Vector
Labs, Peterborough, UK) in primary diluent (PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100; Sigma) or 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with 5% normal
rabbit serum (Vector Labs, UK) for IL-1 staining. Sections were incubated
overnight with primary antibodies as follows: mouse monoclonal
anti-CD41/integrin alpha 2b antibody (platelets) (1:100, BD, NJ, USA),
rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) and an immuno doublestain
of rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) with goat anti-
IL-1α(IL-1αco-localisation) (1:100 R&D Systems, USA), primary goat
anti-mouse IL-1β IgG antibody (1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Sections were further incubated with secondary antibodies
conjugated to Alexa 488 nm or Alexa 594 nmfluorochromes (1:500,
Invitrogen, UK) for 2 h at room temperature or biotinylated rabbit
anti-goat antibody (1:500, Vector Labs) for 2 h followed by nickel

significantly worse decrease in HbO2. At 360 min postfilament removal we have a continued decrease in∆HbO2 in the vehicle injected group often to levels below those during the
ischaemic event. This late reperfusion deficit is even worse in IL-1 injected animals. The third column shows the masks drawn to exclude major vessels from quantitative analysis,

ammonia diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining procedure (for further details
see (Brown et al., 2004, Burrows et al., 2015, Lu and Partridge,
1998; Nielsen et al., 1987) for IL-1 staining. Afinal wash was performed
in PBS before application of Prolong Gold antifade reagent (with or
without DAPI; Invitrogen, USA) used as the mounting medium for
glass coverslips or DPX mounting medium (Agar Scientific, Stansted,
UK). Images for analysis were captured using an Olympus widefield
BX51 upright microscope with filter sets matching the fluorescence
markers. Equivalent areas of the cerebral cortex at the same magnification
(×20) were imaged across both groups for each specific marker.
Structural images for CD41 platelets and Iba-1 changes were collected
on a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS upright confocal microscope. When it was
not possible to eliminate cross-talk between channels, the images
were collected sequentially. The maximum intensity projections of
these 3D stacks are shown in the results. Images were taken at ×40
magnification. IL-1 IHC staining was captured using a brightfield
Olympus S2X9 microscope to gain full-slice images.
IgG immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the leakage of
endogenous IgG into the brain parenchyma as a measure of BBB breakdown.
Sections were washed with PBS followed by incubation with a
second blocking agent, consisting of 5% normal horse serum (Vector
Labs) and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X-
100 (Sigma) was applied for 1 h. Sections were incubated with biotinylated
horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500, Vector Labs). DAB staining
protocol, as described above, was performed prior to coverslipping
with DPX mounting medium.
Cresyl Violet (CV) stained brain sections were mounted on gelatinized
slides and initially soaked in alcohol of increasing concentrations 50%,
70%, 90%, and 100% followed by descending order (4 min each concentration
) to remove lipids andfixation chemicals from the tissue. Sections
were then submerged with 1.5% CV staining solution. Ultraclear
(4 min) was used as a clearing agent, making unstained parts of the
tissue transparent followed by coverslipping with DPX mounting
medium.
2.8. Data analysis
2.8.1. Immunohistochemistry
Images of the cerebral cortex were collected fromfive evenly spaced
sections spanning the somatosensory cortex from both hemispheres for
comparison. IgG and IL-1βwere quantified by measuring the mean grey
value (pixel density) of each hemisphere, the value of which was
subtracted from the absolute white value (max), and comparing interhemispheric
values. Activated microglial (Iba-1) and platelet cells
(CD41) were double-blinded to eliminate bias and then counted manually
and in each hemisphere in a 0.46 × 0.34 mm size region of the
somatosensory cortex. CV cells for cortex counts were centred on
layer IV with a 0.3 × 0.3 mm region of interest for all animals.
2.9. Calculation of oxyhaemoglobin concentration
Changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentrations were calculated
by spectroscopic analysis with a pathlength scaling Beer Lambert
algorithm (Berwick et al., 2005) between the sets of four wavelengths
at different time points within the experiment. Baseline variability in
cortical HbO
2
levels was deduced from comparison of an image set recorded
before injection with an image set recorded after injection but
before occlusion. To establish the extent of the decrease in HbO
2
during
occlusion, we compared the set before occlusion (but after injection)
with those at the end of the 30 min occlusion. Once these maps were
created, we produced a single mask for each animal to exclude the
large arteries and veins from further analysis. This approach allowed
the calculation ofμmolar changes in∆HbO
2
concentration in the area of
microvascular perfusion of the parenchyma before, during and after occlusion
, as well as comparisons between groups. For the visualization of
ΔHbO
2
we created aμmol colour scale, with blue for a decrease, red an
increase and with green colours indicating little change compared with
the reference time point (Fig. 2). For statistical evaluation, the mean
pixel values of the regions outside the masks ofΔHbO
2
maps were calculated.
Due to a slight variability of carrying out the complex experiment,
the timing within the groups for the data acquisition during early reperfusion
ranged from 8 to 12 min after block removal and later reperfusion
ranged from 350 to 360 min. The timing of baseline recordings and recordings
during occlusion was precise up to the minute (Fig. 2).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Animals were randomized for experiments and quantitative analyses
were double-blinded across all groups; vehicle group n = 10, IL-
1βgroup n = 10. Past experience and review of referenced publications
(Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b) have shown
that a group size of 10 provides reasonable assurance of statistical
power for this type of study. One-way ANOVA was used to compare
mean HbO
2
concentration change inμmolar values outside the masked
regions in the imaging data and to compare between the two groups for
the immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence marker staining,
coupled with Bonferroni multiple comparison test in histology data to
indicate differences between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
, calculated and displayed as mean values with error (±)
displayed by standard deviation. The nine animals that were sacrificed
70 min after injection were analysed separately and not compared to
the animals that had undergone 6 h reperfusion.
3. Results
3.1. IL-1 treatment increases reperfusion deficit
In order to establish that the i.p. injections themselves do not cause a
change of the HbO
2
concentrations, we compared recordings before and
after the injection. Baseline recordings from the two experimental
groups show non-significantfluctuations between trials recorded preinjection

On MCA occlusion there was a 5-to-6-fold decrease in∆HbO
2
in the
IL-1 and vehicle injected groups within the stroked hemisphere, with no
significant difference between the two treatments (Fig. 3). After 30 min
of occlusion, when the filament was retracted, there is an instant

end of the MCAo (Fig. 3).
3.2. Increase in biomarkers of ischaemic damage after IL-1 treatment
Hyper-coagulated platelets were observed within the cerebral microvasculature
of the stroked hemisphere in IL-1 injected mice compared to
vehicle injected (Fig. 4). Platelet clusters were determined by size; small
clusters ranged b10 μm2, medium clusters 10–30 μm2 and hypercoagulated
clusters N30 μm2, based on the work of (Murray et al.,
2013). Systemic injection of IL-1 coupled with 30 min MCAo induced a
48.1% increase of platelet aggregates b10 μm2 (P b 0.01) as well as a
34.3% increase in aggregatesN30μm2(Pb0.001) within the stroked cerebral
cortex compared to the same region within the vehicle injected
group (Fig. 4). Morphological changes in platelet aggregation were apparent
between the two groups with the IL-1 injected mice displaying large

aggregates whichfill the diameter and length of larger microvessels. The
aggregates themselves appear to show cellular clusters, which could indicate
platelet:leukocyte interactions (Fig. 4 (I + II)).
In order to investigate that these platelet aggregates do not appear
early before any reperfusion delay we processed the brain tissue that
was perfused 70 min after IL-1 (n = 4) or vehicle (n = 5) injection in
the same manner. The mean count for any of the three platelet cluster
sizes in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of both groups
was b3 demonstrating the absence of an early aggregation (Fig. 5).
In order to determine BBB breakdown leakage of systemic protein
IgG into the stroked brain hemisphere was quantified. IgG was localized
mainly to the ipsilateral hemisphere and was elevated by 35.3%
(Pb0.05) with IL-1 treatment when compared with the vehicle injected
group (Fig. 6) Systemic IL-1 injection also increased the number of
activated Iba-1+ microglia within the stroked 39.2% (P b 0.001) and
contralateral 58.5% (Pb0.001) cerebral cortex compared to the equivalent
regions within the vehicle injected group (Fig. 6B). Microglia were
considered ‘activated’upon identification of a bushy rod or amoeboid
morphological appearance (Fig. 6B (II + III)).
IL-1α co-localized to Iba-1 stained microglia was not significantly
different between the two groups comparing the ipsilateral hemisphere
of the vehicle and IL-1β injected group (Fig. 7). Cresyl violet staining
revealed a reduction (26.8%, Pb0.05) in the number of healthy neurons
in the cortex of the IL-1 treated group, cells being darker stained with
angular cell bodies, indicative of pyknotic morphology (Fig. 8).
4. Discussion
Our findings show that systemic IL-1 administration just prior to
MCAo significantly reduces reperfusion of the cerebral microvasculature
when compared to vehicle treated animals, potentially through hypercoagulation
of CD41+ platelets and leukocytes within the cerebral
microvessels.
Infection and inflammation-related co-morbidities increase the risk
and worsen outcome in stroke patients (Bottcher and Falk, 1999; Grau
et al., 1995, Herz et al., 2015, Pinto et al., 2004, Smeeth et al., 2004). IL-
1 mimics aspects of infection and has been shown to exacerbate brain
damage and neuronal deficit similar to the effects of bacterial endotoxin
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Denesetal.,2010a,2010b,Denesetal.,2011,
McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b). Furthermore recent data show that infection
worsens outcome in experimental stroke via IL-1 dependent mechanisms
(Denes et al., 2014). This adds to the already extensive data
suggesting IL-1 as a key mediator of ischaemic injury (Murray et al.,
2015).The mechanisms by which systemic inflammation exacerbates
ischaemic brain damage remain to be fully determined; though effects
on the BBB and microvascular reperfusion have all been suggested to
have a role (McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, Murray et al., 2013). Chronic
systemic inflammation is associated with increased platelet aggregation
after MCA occlusion (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b) and here we show a
direct effect of systemic inflammation on haemodynamic parameters,
establishing a pro-coagulant state in which CD41+ platelets hypercoagulate
within the microvasculature in a synergistic response to exacerbated
microglial activation. We have also demonstrated that those
platelet aggregates do not form early after the ischaemic event,
i.e. 10 min after MCAo. Platelet aggregation promotes microvascular
dysfunction through activation and release of mediators whichpromote
leukocyte:platelet accumulation (Afshar-Kharghan and Thiagarajan,
2006). Physical obstruction of microvessels compromises collateral
blood flow and contributes towards infarct expansion (Del Zoppo
et al., 1991). Hyper-coagulated platelet microthrombi could be

contributing to the lack of sustained reperfusion within the IL-1 injected
group through physical and pathological mechanisms. Platelets bound
to the wall of the endothelium become activated, stimulating the
release of potent cytokines IL-1αand TNF-αwhich induce endothelial
adhesion molecule upregulation, mediating leukocyte transmigration
in to the brain parenchyma (Afshar-Kharghan and Thiagarajan, 2006).
Although a definitive role for hyper-coagulated platelets has not been
investigated here, in human studies it has been found that a strong systemic
platelet activation is associated with thrombin generation, leading
to platelet:platelet interactions as opposed to platelet:leukocyte interactions
in different subtypes of cerebral ischaemia (Turgut et al., 2011). Experimental
studies have found that LPS increases large heteroconjugates
of platelets and CD45-positive leukocyte subpopulations (Mirlashari
et al., 2002). Systemic IL-1 could be promoting platelet:leukocyte
heteroconjugation over platelet:platelet aggregation leading to secondary
micro-occlusions within the larger microvessels following an ischaemic
challenge. Platelets have also been shown to induce monocyte
chemotactic protein (MCP-1) and expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial
cells at sites of vascular injury via an IL-1 dependent mechanism
(Gawaz et al., 2000). ThesefindingssuggestthatsystemicIL-1couldbe
exacerbating the coagulation cascade in response to an induced ischaemic
event and thus promoting an exaggerated platelet:leukocyte adhesion
and coagulation, increasing aggregate size. Confocal images from
our immunofluorescence investigations revealed large platelet clusters
and cellular morhphological aggregates clogging the lumen and large
portions of larger microvessels. Without further markers we were unable
to identify if these cellular shapes where in fact leukocytes and further
research to specifically delineate the mechanisms by which IL-1βcould
increase platelet adhesion with other platelets or leukocytes needs to
be undertaken.
IL-1αco-localized to Iba-1-positive microglia was more prevalent in
the IL-1β injected somatosensory cortex compared to the vehicle
injected however these values were not significant. IL-1α activates
microvessel endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecules; ICAM-
1, VCAM-1 and CXCL1, which facilitate transendothelial migration of
leukocytes into the brain parenchyma, contributing to BBB breakdown
and ischaemic damage (McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, Thornton et al.,
2010). Here we also saw that BBB dysfunction was exacerbated with

acute systemic IL-1 administration, agreeing with previous studies
where IL-1 was shown to result in loss of tight junctions as a result of
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release from neutrophils, leading
to proteolytic breakdown of the BBB (McColl, 2008). Other studies
confirm that IL-1 driven leukocyte transmigration results in the release
of neurotoxic mediators from neutrophils that can exacerbate neuronal
damage (Allen et al., 2012).
In conclusion, we show for thefirst time that, within 3 h offilament
removal, a systemic inflammatory challenge with IL-1 significantly
exacerbates reperfusion deficits following a 30 min focal ischaemic
event in the brain, highlighting the adverse effects co-morbidity can
have on the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke. These findings reiterate
the importance of including clinically relevant co-morbidities
in preclinical stroke research to improve the potential for translational
success.
