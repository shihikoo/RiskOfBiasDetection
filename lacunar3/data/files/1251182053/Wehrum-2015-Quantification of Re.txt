ratio  was an independent predictor of retrograde pathline 
length (r = 0.44; p = 0.002). ROC analysis identified a VTI ratio
threshold value of 0.6012 with a sensitivity of 0.5, a specificity
of 0.92, and positive and negative predictive values of 
0.84 and 0.68, respectively. Accordingly, 11 (22.91%) patients

independent predictors of DAo flow reversal in large-scale 
studies. However, TEE is only of limited value as a screening

 Introduction 
 Complex atheromatous plaques (i.e.  ≥ 4 mm thick, ulcerated
or containing thrombi) of the thoracic aorta are 
considered a major source of stroke if they are located 
proximal to the outlets of the brain-supplying arteries  [1] . 
These plaques can be identified with high reliability using 
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)  [1] ,  computed 
tomography (CT)  [2, 3] , and aortic magnetic resonance

 Abstract 
Background:  Retrograde diastolic blood flow in the proximal
descending aorta (DAo), which connects plaques 
 ≥ 4  mm  thickness with brain-supplying arteries, has previously
been identified as a possible source of brain embolism. 
Currently, only 4D flow MRI is able to visualize and quantify 
potential retrograde embolization pathways in the DAo invivo.
Hence, it was our aim to test if the extent of retrograde 
flow could be estimated by routine 2D transesophageal 
echocardiography (TEE).  Methods:  Forty-eight acute stroke 
patients were prospectively included and they underwent 
Doppler examinations of the transition zone between the 
aortic arch and the DAo using a 20 mm 2D sample volume in 
longitudinal section at 90–140° Doppler angle during routine
TEE. Velocity-time-integrals (VTI) were studied for antegrade
and retrograde velocities and the ratio (VTI ratio )  was 
calculated and correlated with the length of retrograde 
pathlines at that site, which were visualized using 4D flow 
MRI at 3-Tesla. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve was used to evaluate a threshold value of VTI ratio  in differentiating
large ( ≥ 3 cm) from small (<3 cm) retrograde flow 
extent.  Results:  At the TEE measurement site, the mean VTI-
ratio  was 0.53 ± 0.16 and the mean length of retrograde path-

imaging (MRI)  [4–6] . Thereby, most complex aortic 
plaques are found in the proximal descending aorta 
(DAo) (i.e. distal aortic arch) behind the outlet of the left 
subclavian artery (LSA). Some of these plaques may constitute
a potential stroke mechanism in case of occurrence 
of diastolic retrograde blood flow connecting complex 
plaques with the LSA, the left common carotid artery, 
and/or the brachiocephalic trunk  [7] . In previous studies, 
the extent of such DAo blood flow reversal and thus the 
existence of potential retrograde embolization pathways 
was assessed in vivo using 4D flow MRI  [6–9],  which requires
a comprehensive infrastructure and is also very 
time consuming  [9] . 
  Hence, the purpose of this study was to test if the extent
of DAo flow reversal as visualized by 4D flow MRI 
can also be predicted by 2D pulsed-wave Doppler measurements
in TEE, which is commonly used in clinical 
routine  [10] . Accordingly, TEE alone would be sufficient 
to both detect complex DAo atheroma and assess the risk 
of retrograde brain embolization in individual patients.
  Methods 
 Patients 
 During a nine-month period in 2011, 485 consecutive ischemic 
stroke patients  ≥ 18 years of age admitted to our hospital which 
underwent routine diagnostics (brain CT, MRI or both, Doppler 
ultrasound of extra- and intracranial arteries, transthoracic echocardiography
, 12 lead and Holter ECG, routine laboratory tests 
and additionally factor V Leiden mutation, decreased antithrombin
III, protein C and S, and increased antiphospholipid antibody 
titer in patients <60 years of age) were enrolled for TEE examination.
Of these, 48 patients were randomly selected on a weekly basis
using www.randomization.com and underwent additional 4D 
flow MRI. Cardiovascular risk factors, stroke etiology and severity 
of stroke on admission were prospectively documented as described
previously  [6] . The study was approved by the University 
of Freiburg ethics committee and informed consent was obtained 
from all participants.
  TEE of the Aorta 
 TEE examinations of the aorta were performed by one experienced
cardiologist using a Philips iU22 (Philips Healthcare, Best, 
The Netherlands) ultrasonic device and a 2–7 MHz ultrasound 
probe (S7-2t Omni Sector transesophageal phased array; 180 degrees
electronic rotation, field of view: 90°, electrocautery suppression
). After routine TEE examination (i.e. evaluation of the heart 
and detection of aortic plaques), the transducer was rotated in order
to visualize the DAo in transverse (0°) section. The transition 
zone between the arch curvature and the straight DAo was located 
by the retraction of the probe in cross-sectional view until the 
round lumen of the straight DAo became oval. In this area the 
blood flow profile was studied using color-guided 2D pulsed-wave 
spectral Doppler velocities using a 20 mm sample volume in longitudinal
section at 90–140° Doppler angle ( fig. 1 ). Color-guided 
pulse wave spectral Doppler velocities were obtained as parallel to 
the flow as possible by rotation and angulation of the TEE probe 
( ∼ 30° from the transducer and  ∼ 60° from axial flow in the descending
aorta). Measurements were recorded and quantifications 
were made offline on the ultrasound platform. Flow profiles in 
both systole and diastole were outlined manually to measure velocity-time
integrals (VTI). Each measurement was performed 
over three consecutive heart beats and mean diastolic/systolic ratio 
was considered for further analysis. 
  MRI of the Aorta 
 All MRI examinations were conducted using a 3-Tesla MRI 
system (TIM Trio, Siemens Healthcare AG, Erlangen, Germany). 
4D flow MRI (echo time/repetition time (TE/TR) = 2.6 ms/5 ms, 
flip angle = 7°, temporal resolution = 20 ms, spatial resolution = 
2.0 × 1.7 × 2.2 mm 3 ) was performed in order to acquire time-resolved
and three-dimensional blood flow parameters with a velocity
sensitivity (venc) of 150 cm/s. Experiments were ECG-synchronized
and respiration-controlled using navigator-gating  [11] .  4D 
flow MRI datasets were further analyzed using MEVISFlow software
(Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany) (for technical details
see  [9] ). Maximum retrograde flow in cm (rounded down to 
the next integer, range: 0–6 cm) based on pathlines emitted from 
an analysis plane with a position of 3 cm distal to the LSA and corresponding
to the TEE measurement site ( fig. 1 ) was assessed by 
one observer on a visual basis  [6, 9, 11] . Retrograde distances were 
measured along the aortic centerline because it proved to be a reliable
indicator of maximum retrograde flow previously  [6–8] . 
  Statistical  Analysis 
 Data are presented as mean (±standard deviation) or median 
(interquartile range) for continuous, absolute, and relative frequencies
for categorical variables. Correlations of the mean diastolic
/systolic VTI ratio (VTI ratio ) with retrograde pathline length 
as quantified by 4D flow MRI were studied using Pearson’s correlation.
Retrograde flow with an extent of  ≥ 3 cm was able to reach 
the outlet of the LSA from the measurement site. Therefore, datasets
were classified in large ( ≥ 3 cm) and small (<3 cm) extent of 
flow reversal. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
performed to evaluate the threshold value of VTI ratio  in differentiating
large from small retrograde flow extent. The optimal cutpoint
was determined by maximizing the Youden-index. 0.05 was 
used as the level of statistical significance. Statistical analyses were 
performed using IBM-SPSS Statistics version 19.0.1.

  Quantification of Retrograde Flow in the Proximal 
Descending Aorta 
 Diastolic retrograde blood flow within the DAo was 
observed in all 48 patients by retrograde pathline visualization
using 4D flow MRI and by the detection of diastolic
negative (i.e. retrograde) VTIs in TEE. The means 
of TEE measures (i.e. VTI antegrade ,  VTI retrograde ,  and 
 VTI ratio ) at the TEE measurement site within the proximal
DAo and the 4D flow MRI target parameters are given
in  table 2 . 
  Identification of Patients with High Retrograde Flow 
by VTI Analysis 
 VTI antegrade  values correlated positively with 
 VTI retrograde  (r = 0.58; p < 0.001). However, high 
 VTI antegrade  values coincided with proportionally higher 
VTI retrograde , resulting in a higher VTI ratio  (r = 0.62; p < 
0.001) with increasing VTI retrograde .  VTI ratio  was believed 
to be the best estimator for retrograde DAo blood flow 
and its increase significantly explained the increase of 
retrograde pathline length as visualized by MRI (r = 0.44; 
p = 0.002). Patients were grouped into 22 patients (45.8%) 
with large ( ≥ 3 cm) and 26 patients (54.2%) with small 
retrograde flow (<3 cm) (see  fig. 2 ). A receiver-operatorcharacteristic
(ROC) ( fig.  3 ) curve analysis was performed
using the VTI ratio  values and this analysis revealed
an area under the curve of 0.68 at p = 0.031 and a 
95% confidence interval of 0.52 to 0.85. When choosing 
a VTI ratio  cutoff value of 0.6012, the sensitivity was 0.5 
with a specificity of 0.92. The positive predictive value 
was 0.84 and the negative predictive value was 0.68. 
 Actually, 11 (22.91%) of all 48 patients had a VTI ratio   cutoff
value  ≥ 0.6012. Only 2 patients had a VTI ratio   cutoff 
value  ≥ 0.6012, but flow extent in MRI was <3 cm.
  Discussion 
 Our study enrolled unselected ischemic stroke patients
scheduled for TEE. We measured VTIs at the transition
zone between the arch curvature and the straight 
descending aorta in longitudinal-section to evaluate the 
retrograde blood flow in the DAo by TEE. Diastolic retrograde
blood flow within the proximal DAo was observed
in all 48 patients irrespective of whether MRI or 
TEE was used for its detection; this is in accordance with 
a previous study  [6] . The maximum extent of retrograde 
flow (i.e. length of pathlines) on MRI showed a great inter-individual
variability. Actually, 98% of the subjects 
had a retrograde flow extent of  ≥ 1 cm, 73% of  ≥ 2 cm, and 
45.8% of  ≥ 3 cm. This information in conjunction with 
data from a previous study  [6]  suggests that especially 
plaques within the first cm of the DAo are prone to flow 
reversal reaching the LSA or even the left common carotid
artery and the brachiocephalic trunk.
  Our goal was to give a TEE-based estimation if a patient
would have a large ( ≥ 3 cm) or small (<3 cm) extent 
of retrograde flow. We used a 20 mm sample volume in 
central position and longitudinal section because it 
proved to be a reliable estimator of retrograde flow in a 
previous study  [10] . It was not possible to identify the exact
individual corresponding site for MRI measures because
the position of the transition zone between the arch 
curvature and the DAo varied among individuals and its 
distance to the LSA could not be precisely determined by 
TEE. However, previous data suggested  [6]  that variation 
of retrograde flow extent was little among different planes 
in the DAo and the position of the plane 3 cm distal to the 
LSA was supposed to plausibly approximate to the TEE 
measurement site. This plane was therefore used in our 
approach to define a cutoff value for high extent of retrograde
flow. Our ROC analysis revealed an area under 
the curve of 0.68 with a broad 95% confidence interval of 
0.52 to 0.85, which was due to the small sample size of 
only 48 subjects. Our cutoff value (0.6012) coincided with 
a high specificity, which seems reasonable in a setting 
where one wants to identify only patients with a high 
probability of retrograde embolization. 
  Limitations of this study were the small sample size 
and the lack of 3D aortic coverage using 2D TEE. Further-

more, an exact quantification of axial antegrade and retrograde
velocities was not possible due to the anatomical 
situation even though color-guided pulse wave spectral 
Doppler velocities were obtained as parallel to the flow as 
possible. To account for this error, we used the VTI ratio   to 
estimate retrograde flow extent. High inter-individual 
differences in retrograde flow extent, and the fact that retrograde
flow seems to be common to a certain extent in 
all studied patients  [6]  resulted only in moderate correlation
coefficients. 
  Nevertheless, TEE has the advantage of being used as 
a routine tool in the workup of stroke and allows examination
of many subjects in short time, which may facilitate
the identification of independent predictors of 
DAo flow reversal. In addition, we have shown that TEE 
enables the estimation of retrograde flow extent. Hence, 
we make the following suggestions: potential retrograde 
embolization to the LSA can be assumed with high certainty
as soon as a complex plaque is detected by TEE, 
MRI or CT within the first 2 cm of the proximal descending
aorta. If a complex plaque is located more distal (i.e. 
3 cm) or a retrograde embolization via the left common 
carotid artery or the brachiocephalic trunk is suspected, 
screening for high retrograde flow extent using TEE 
seems reasonable. However, only 22% of patients can be 
spared 4D flow MRI by applying TEE as a screening 
method. Therefore, 4D flow MRI remains indispensable 
for the exact assessment of individual embolization pathways
from plaques of the DAo in vivo and should be performed
in case of uncertainty.
