Pyruvate Protects the Brain Against Ischemia–Reperfusion
Injury by Activating the Erythropoietin Signaling Pathway
Myoung-Gwi Ryou, PhD; Ran Liu, MD; Ming Ren, MD; Jie Sun, BS;
Robert T. Mallet, PhD; Shao-Hua Yang, MD, PhD
Background and Purpose—Pyruvate is known to be cytoprotective through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
We tested the hypothesis that pyruvate protects the brain against ischemia–reperfusion injury by inducing
endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) expression.
Methods—Pyruvate’s protective effect was evaluated in C6 glioma cells and HT22 neuronal cells subjected to transient
oxygen glucose deprivation. Cell viability (calcein AM assay) and expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1, EPO, Akt
and Erk (immunoblot), and EPO receptor (reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) were analyzed. Transient
focal cerebral ischemia in rats was induced by 2 hours middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24 hours
reperfusion. Pyruvate or saline was infused from 60 minutes occlusion until 30 minutes reperfusion. Lesion volume and
DNA fragmentation were assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated
dUTP nick end-labeling assay, respectively. Immunoblots were conducted to determine cerebral EPO contents.
Results— Pyruvate increased cell viability, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, EPO, and Akt phosphorylation. Small interfering
RNA suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and EPO abolished pyruvate-induced cytoprotection. In the rat stroke
model, pyruvate reduced lesion volume by 84% and DNA fragmentation by 77% versus controls; increased EPO content
paralleled these cerebroprotective actions of pyruvate.
Conclusions— Pyruvate activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1–EPO signaling cascade in neurons and glia could
protect the brain from ischemia–reperfusion injury. (Stroke. 2012;43:1101-1107.)
Key Words: brain recovery  erythropoietin  focal ischemia  hypoxia-inducible factor  pyruvate  stroke care
Despite decades of research and promising results from
animal studies, effective treatments to protect the brain
from ischemic stroke have proven elusive. Erythropoietin
(EPO) has been found to be neuroprotective in stroke models.1 However, because the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits
EPO entry into the brain parenchyma,2 high doses are
required that can produce untoward side effects including
hypercoagulability and polycythemia in clinical practice.3,4
Strategies to lower the EPO dosages necessary to protect the
ischemic brain merit investigation.
Preclinical studies have shown that the mammalian brain
can synthesize substantial amounts of EPO.5,6 Astrocytes6
and neurons7 are the major sources of EPO in the brain.
Moreover, EPO’s membrane receptors (EPOR) are expressed
in the brain.8 Therefore, alternative approaches that induce
endogenous EPO production in the brain might obviate the
detrimental side effects of EPO.
Pyruvate has proven to be protective in cerebropathological
conditions,9,10 but its mechanisms remain unclear. We
demonstrated that pyruvate-enriched cardioplegia induced
EPO mRNA and protein expression in swine myocardium
undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.11 Moreover, monocarboxylate
transporters in the BBB12 and plasma membranes13
efficiently deliver circulating pyruvate to the brain
parenchyma.
Erythropoietin is the first identified target gene induced by
hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a key transcription factor
for cellular responses to hypoxia.14 Pyruvate stabilizes the
O
2
-regulated subunit of HIF-1, HIF-1, by inhibiting its
proteosomal degradation.15 Accordingly, pyruvate-enriched
cardioplegia increased myocardial HIF-1.11
This study tested the hypotheses that pyruvate induces
EPO signaling, and interference with EPO’s signaling pathways
abrogates pyruvate-induced protection in neuronal and
glial cells, thereby implicating EPO as a pivotal mediator of
pyruvate cerebroprotection. Additionally, we determined
whether exogenous pyruvate can protect the rat brain from
ischemic stroke and whether this protection parallels EPO
induction within the brain.

Materials and Methods
Hypoxia–Reoxygenation of Neuronal and
Glial Cells
Glia and neurons are the major cell types in the brain; therefore,
delineating cytoprotective signaling cascades in these cells can
provide crucial information regarding pyruvate’s protective mechanisms
against ischemic stroke. Mouse neuronal HT22 cells were a
gift from Dr David Schubert, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA, and glial
fibrillary acidic protein-positive rat C6 glioma cells were obtained
from ATCC (Rockville, MD). For hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R),
cells were switched to glucose- and fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco
modified Eagle medium containing 0, 5, or 10 mmol/L
pyruvate and incubated in a hypoxic atmosphere (0.5% O
2
) for 12
hours followed by 24 hours of reoxygenation and renewedD-glucose
(11 mmol/L) availability.
Cell Viability
Cell viability was determined with calcein AM assay. C6 glial and
HT22 neuronal cells were assigned to control or pyruvate groups of
6 independent trials, each in sextuplicate. Cells were incubated with
1 mol/L calcein AM at 37°C for 10 minutes. Fluorescence was
measured with excitation/emission at 485/530 nm.
Immunoblot of Hypoxia-Responsive Proteins
Contents of HIF-1, EPO signaling pathway components, and actin
were analyzed by immunoblotting of brain extracts and cell lysates.
Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay16 to
ensure equal loading of 30 g/lane. Primary antibodies were mouse
monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1, EPO, Erk/p-Erk, Akt/p-Akt,
and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat antimouse secondary
antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove,
PA). Protein bands were quantified (Ultraviolet Products, Upland,
CA) and normalized to actin.
Real Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase
Chain Reaction Measurements of mRNA
Real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was used
to assess abundances of EPOR and actin mRNA in HT 22 neuronal
cells. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen).
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with Taqman reverse
transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). EPOR and
-actin cDNA were amplified in a Smart Cycler II (Cepheid,
Sunnyvale, CA) by a SYBR Green Polymerase Chain Reaction
Master Mix (Promega) and an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction System. Two-step real-time polymerase
chain reaction was performed (95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 60
seconds extension and detection, 40 cycles) with specific primers for
EPOR (forward: 5-GTAGGGGCCGTCAGATGAGT-3; reverse:
5-CCTTTTCCTGCTCTGTTTGG-3) and -actin (forward: 5-
TCTTTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCTTG-3; reverse: 5-GCACTGTGTTGGCATAGAGGTC-3). Abundances of amplified genes were
assessed by analysis of cycle threshold.
Small Interfering RNA Silencing of HIF-1
HIF-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was performed
with siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according
to the manufacturer’s protocols. HIF-1 siRNA (2 nmol/L) was

mixed with a transfection reagent added to neuronal cells (n6/
group) and equivalent concentrations of scrambled sequence siRNAs
were transfected for negative control. Silencing of HIF-1 transcription
was confirmed by immunoblot.
EPO Pathway Inhibition
To interrogate the involvement of EPO signaling in pyruvateinduced
cytoprotection, soluble EPOR (Sigma) was applied to HT22
neuronal (n15/group) and C6 glial (n10/group) cells and pretreated
for 6 hours.17 After H/R, cell viability was determined as
described previously.
Surgical Preparation for Rat Stroke Experiments
Animal experimentation was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of University of North Texas Health
Science Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (275–300 g; Charles
River, Wilmington, MA) were housed under 12-hour light:dark
cycles and consumed food and water ad libitum. Rats were anesthetized
with 1.5% isoflurane and temperature was maintained at
37.00.5°C with an electric heating pad. Ventilatory frequency,
heart rate, and SpO2
were monitored. The right jugular vein was
cannulated for pyruvate or normal saline infusion.
Pharmacokinetics of Infused Pyruvate
Circulating pyruvate concentrations during pyruvate infusion and
washout were determined colorimetrically18 in a Shimadzu dualwavelength
spectrophotometer (337/417 nm, 5.65 mol/
L1  cm1). Plasma (300 L) was sampled at 10-minute intervals
before, during, and after 30 minutes pyruvate infusion
(0.05 mmol  kg1  min1), flash-frozen in liquid N
2
, and extracted
in 1 vol 0.6 N HClO
4
.
Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion–Reperfusion Protocol
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion,19 in which the left middle cerebral artery was
occluded by a 3-0 monofilament suture for 2 hours and then
reperfused for 24 hours by withdrawing the suture. Rats were
randomly assigned to control (normal saline, n8) or pyruvate
(n12) treatments. Sodium pyruvate (1 mol/L) prepared in sterile
water was infused at 0.05 mmol  kg1  min1 for 90 minutes from
60 minutes occlusion until 30 minutes after reperfusion.
At 24 hours postreperfusion, brains were harvested, divided into
slices at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 mm posterior to the olfactory bulb,
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and planimetrically
analyzed (Image-Pro Plus 4.1; Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, MD) to determine lesion volume. In another 18 rats (9
control, 9 pyruvate), the cerebral hemispheres were harvested at 24
hours reperfusion, and the cortex and subcortex were separated,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and extracted in buffer containing
phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktail. Proteins were analyzed by
immunoblot as described previously.
Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated
dUTP Nick-End Labeling Detection of
DNA Fragmentation
Paraffin-embedded brain sections (8 m) were stained for terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelingpositive
cells with the Dead END Fluorescent kit (Promega, Madison
, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then
counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
nuclear stain. The fluorescent signal was visualized and photo-

were counted in 20 microscope fields from a single section for
each animal using a CAST-Grid system (Nikon, Inc). Seven microscope

as previously described.20
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean valuesSEM. Single comparisons
between 2 groups used Student t test. Multiple comparisons between
hypoxia groups and with the normoxic control was accomplished by
2-way analysis of variance combined with Tukey multiple comparison
test to identify statistically significant differences. Plasma
pyruvate concentrations before and after pyruvate infusion were
compared by single-factor analysis of variance followed by Tukey
multiple comparison test. Probability values 0.05 were taken to
indicate statistically significant effects.
Results
Cytoprotection by Pyruvate Against
Hypoxia–Reoxygenation
Pyruvate-induced cytoprotection was tested in C6 glioma
and HT22 neuronal cell lines subjected to H/R. Twelve
hours of hypoxia and 24 hours reoxygenation killed50%
of C6 cells (Figure 1A). Five and 10 mmol/L pyruvate
increased viability of these cells by 39% and 81%, respectively
(Figure 1A–B). A similar response was detected in
HT22 cells: 10 mmol/L pyruvate increased viability by
40% versus control (Figure 1C).
Pyruvate-Induced EPO Signaling
Components of the EPO signaling cascade were examined in
HT22 neuronal and C6 glioma cells to determine if pyruvate can
activate cytoprotective signaling. Relative to control, 10 mmol/L
pyruvate increased HIF-1nearly 3- and 2-fold in HT22 and C6
cells, respectively. Pyruvate increased EPO contents 2-fold in
HT22 cells (Figure 2A–B) and 2.5-fold in C6 cells (Supplemental
data; http://stroke.ahajournals.org). Because EPOR primary
antibody reportedly crossreacts with heat shock protein,21
EPOR mRNA expression was analyzed. Pyruvate increased
EPOR mRNA abundance in HT22 cells approximately 20-
fold both before and after H/R (Figure 2C). Pyruvate increased
Akt phosphorylation 4- and 2.5-fold in HT22 neuronal
and C6 glioma cells, respectively (Figure 2A–B;
Supplemental Figure I) but did not alter Erk-1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 2A–B).
To interrogate the roles of HIF-1 and EPO in pyruvateinduced
neuroprotection, HT22 cells were transfected with
HIF-1 siRNA, which lowered H/R-induced HIF-1 expression
50% (Figure 3A). HIF-1 siRNA abrogated the cytoprotection
of 5 and 10 mmol/L pyruvate (Figure 3B). To
further define EPO’s role in protection, HT22 neuronal and
C6 glioma cells were incubated with soluble EPOR to bind
EPO originating in the cells. This strategy blunted pyruvateinduced
protection of HT22 neuronal (Figure 3C–D) and C6
glioma (Supplemental Figure II) cells subjected to H/R.
Pyruvate Cerebroprotection in an In Vivo
Stroke Model
The impact of pyruvate infusion on circulating pyruvate was
evaluated. Venous pyruvate concentration rapidly increased
at the onset of infusion, stabilized at approximately
0.7 mmol/L within 10 minutes, and then subsided after
pyruvate infusion was discontinued (Figure 4A). Next, the
cerebroprotective effects of pyruvate infusion were examined
in rats subjected to 2 hours occlusion and 24 hours reperfusion
of the middle cerebral artery occlusion. Pyruvate or
normal saline was infused intravenously for 90 minutes, from
60 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion until 30 minutes
reperfusion. Pyruvate sharply attenuated lesion volume by
84% versus control (Figure 4B).

The effect of pyruvate on ischemia–reperfusion-induced
DNA fragmentation was examined. In control rats, DNA
fragmentation in the subcortex and cortex was sharply increased
versus the nonischemic contralateral hemisphere.
Pyruvate decreased DNA fragmentation by 80% versus the
control (Figure 4C). A significant correlation (r20.80)
emerged between DNA fragmentation and lesion volume at
24 hours reperfusion (Figure 4D).

Erythropoietin contents in the ischemic cortex and subcortex
were approximately 4-fold increased versus contralateral nonischemic
regions (Figure 5). Pyruvate appreciably increased EPO

respective controls. Interestingly, pyruvate did not increase renal
EPO content (Supplemental Figure III).

Discussion
This study tested the hypothesis that pyruvate treatment
protects the brain from ischemia/reperfusion injury by evoking
EPO synthesis and cytoprotective signaling. In vivo
and in vitro results demonstrated that pyruvate treatment (1)
increased HIF-1 and EPO; (2) activated Akt; (3) enhanced
cell viability; (4) decreased lesion volume; and (5) suppressed
DNA fragmentation.
A pivotal transcription factor, HIF-1, mediates cellular
adaptations to hypoxia.22,23 Transcriptional activity of HIF-1
is controlled by regulating cellular content of its subunit. In
the presence of -ketoglutarate, Fe2, and normal intracellular
O
2
concentrations, prolyl residues in HIF-1 are hydroxylated
by prolyl hydroxylase, leading to proteosomal degradation
and, thus, preventing assembly of HIF-1
heterodimers.22,23 Pyruvate inhibits prolyl hydroxylase by
competing with -ketoglutarate for access to the enzyme’s
catalytic domain.15 Recently, we demonstrated pyruvateenriched
cardioplegia increased HIF-1, EPO, and EPOR
contents and suppressed postbypass inflammation and edema
in the myocardium of pigs maintained on cardiopulmonary
bypass.11In the brain, astrocytes6and neurons7can synthesize
EPO,24 EPOR are present in the brain parenchyma,8 and
pyruvate readily traverses the BBB.12 Because preclinical
studies have shown exogenous EPO to be cerebroprotective,
pyruvate induction of endogenous cerebral EPO production
could be powerfully cerebroprotective. In accordance with
this hypothesis, pyruvate afforded significant protection in
the rat stroke model, manifest as marked reductions in
ischemic lesion volume and DNA fragmentation. Moreover,
pyruvate sharply increased EPO contents in both the ischemic
and nonischemic brain.
Two strategies were used to interrogate the cytoprotective
actions of the pyruvate-induced HIF-1/EPO axis. First, transfection
of cultured neuronal cells with siRNA against the
HIF-1 gene abrogated pyruvate-induced cytoprotection
against oxygen–glucose deprivation. Second, incubation with
soluble EPOR to bind EPO attenuated pyruvate’s cytoprotective
effect, although some residual cytoprotection was noted.
These results substantiate the hypothesis (Figure 6) that
HIF-1 stabilization and, consequently, EPO induction were
pivotal to the pyruvate-induced cerebroprotection.
Soluble EPOR did not completely block pyruvate-induced
cytoprotection, suggesting the involvement of additional,
EPO-independent mechanisms. Indeed, HIF-1 activates expression
of a variety of protective factors,25,26 that enable
cells to survive hypoxic or ischemic insults. Conceivably,
these proteins may confer some cytoprotection even when
EPO signaling is disabled. Furthermore, a neuronal EPOR
isoform, which forms heterodimers with CD131, has been
shown to mediate cytoprotection but not hematopoiesis.27
Because EPO is a ligand of both classical and neuronal EPOR
isoforms, the use of soluble EPOR to bind EPO cannot
differentiate the potential contributions of the 2 EPOR isoforms
to pyruvate’s cytoprotection.
Although mounting evidence of EPO’s cerebroprotection
has been documented in stroke models, EPO’s limited ability
to cross the BBB necessitates high dosages for stroke treatment
, which might impose hypercoagulability and increased
blood viscosity.3,4 Pyruvate readily traverses the BBB and
enters the brain parenchyma through monocarboxylate transporters
in the BBB12and plasma membranes.13In rats, middle
cerebral artery occlusion induced a rapid and substantial
increase of monocarboxylate transporters in neurons, astrocytes
, and vascular endothelium, which could increase the
capacity for pyruvate uptake.28 On entering the brain parenchyma
, pyruvate may stabilize HIF-1 in both neurons and
astrocytes, thereby driving endogenous EPO synthesis. The
endogenous EPO could then activate EPOR in a paracrine or
autocrine fashion,29avoiding the rheological consequences of
high doses of exogenous EPO.
Induction of EPO signaling might not be pyruvate’s sole
neuroprotective mechanism. A natural intermediary metabolite
, pyruvate could function as an energy-yielding fuel for
adenosine triphosphate production and as an antioxidant that
neutralizes reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates30 and
enhances reducing power of the glutathione antioxidant
system.31 Given the tight coupling between cerebral blood
flow and cerebral metabolism, it is conceivable that the
vascular component of the neurovascular unit could also be
involved in the protective mechanisms of pyruvate against
ischemic stroke. Other pharmacological antioxidants that
traverse the BBB also have been found to decrease lesion
volume in rodent focal cerebral ischemia.32,33 Nevertheless,
the fact that HIF-1 siRNA and soluble EPOR abrogated

pyruvate cytoprotection implicates EPO as an essential component
of the protective mechanism and suggests that, without
EPO, pyruvate’s energy-yielding and antioxidant properties
may not be sufficient to defend the brain from severe
ischemia or hypoxia.
Limitations
In this study, the longer-term effects of pyruvate on neuroprotection
were not examined. In this regard, intravenous
pyruvate administration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
afforded substantial neuroprotection 3 days later34 and
protracted pyruvate-induced protection against focal cerebral
ischemia was reported.35 Other HIF-1-activated cytoprotective
proteins could act independently of or in collaboration
with EPO to protect the brain from ischemia–reperfusion.

Supplement materials and methods
Immunoblot of hypoxia-responsive proteins. Contents of HIF-1α, EPO, Akt/pAkt, and actin were 
analyzed by immunoblotting of brain extracts and/or cell lysates. Primary antibodies were mouse 
monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α, EPO, Akt/p-Akt, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 
Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, 
PA). Protein bands were quantified (Ultraviolet Products, Upland, CA) and normalized to actin. 
EPO pathway inhibition. To interrogate the involvement of EPO signaling in the pyruvate 
cytoprotection, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR, Sigma) was applied to C6 glial cells (n=10/group) 
cells. Cells were pretreated for 6h with sEPOR. After H/R, cell viability was determined with 
calcein AM assay.
