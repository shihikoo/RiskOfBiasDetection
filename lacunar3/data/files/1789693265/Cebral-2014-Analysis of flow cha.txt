SUMMARY
Understanding the flow alteration in side branches during flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms
is important to prevent ischemic complications and improve device designs. Flow diverters were placed in
the aorta of four rabbits crossing the origin of side arteries. Subject-specific computational models were
constructed from 3D angiographies and Doppler ultrasounds (DUSs). Flow simulations were run before and
after virtually deploying the flow diverters, assuming distal resistances remained unchanged after treatment.
All jailed arteries remained patent angiographically 8 weeks after treatment. The computational models
estimated decreases compared to pretreatment in the mean flow rates between 2% and 20% and in peak
flow rates between 5% and 36%. The major changes were observed during systole. Flow patterns did not
exhibit recirculation zones before treatment. Implantation of the flow diverters altered the flow structure
only locally near the device wires. No major recirculation regions were created or destroyed. Flow diverters
seem safe with respect to perforator or side branch occlusion. Relatively small changes in flow rates through
jailed arteries are expected, even for moderate to large degrees of coverage of their origins. These results
seem consistent with previous clinical experiences where no or very few complications related to perforator
occlusion have been reported. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
Flow diversion (FD) is increasingly being considered for many complex aneurysms for two main
reasons. On one hand, segmental wide necked aneurysms can be very difficult to treat by either surgical
clipping or endovascular coiling, and on the other hand, many large or giant aneurysms exhibit
a large rate of coil compaction and recanalization. The deployment of a flow diverter is a relatively
simple procedure that has enabled the treatment of aneurysms previously considered untreatable
or very difficult to treat [1, 2]. Deployment of flow diverters or other intracranial stents to assist
aneurysm coiling has substantially reduced the rate of coil compaction and aneurysm recanalization
, presumably by creating a more stable and favorable hemodynamic environment for thrombosis
and aneurysm occlusion [3–6]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that FD may provide higher
aneurysm occlusion rates than coiling with no additional morbidity, similar clinical outcomes and
fewer retreatments [7].

ANALYSIS OF FLOW CHANGES IN SIDE BRANCHES JAILED BY FLOW DIVERTERS 989
The goal of FD is to create an intrasaccular hemodynamic environment that induces organized
and stable thrombus formation as well as to promote endothelialization and reconstruction of the
parent artery [8–10]. Thus, the ideal flow diverter would be a covered device that completely blocks
the blood flow into the aneurysm. However, this is not a viable option because it would occlude
perforators and other arteries in the vicinity of the aneurysm that may be crossed by the device.
Thus, most flow diverters are designed as self-expandable porous metallic meshes with the goal of
disrupting and reducing the blood flow into the aneurysm while maintaining adequate flow in jailed
side branches.
The main concerns with current FD devices include (i) complications associated with delayed
bleeding after treatment, possibly associated to unstable or disorganized thrombosis and lack of protection
of the aneurysm wall for a prolonged period [11, 12]; (ii) complications associated to the
anticoagulation regime prescribed to prevent in-stent thrombosis; (iii) complications associated to
in-stent stenosis or thrombosis; and (iv) complications associated to the occlusion of perforators or
other arteries jailed by the FD devices [13]. Although many difficult aneurysms have been successfully
treated by FD, many of these concerns remain. This study focuses on the latter issue, that is,
possible occlusion of side branches. The rate of perforator occlusion has been estimated at 3% in
a recent meta-analysis study [14]. In this study, a larger significantly lower incidence of perforator
occlusion was observed in aneurysms located in the anterior circulation compared to those in the
posterior circulation. Previous clinical experiences suggest that jailed arteries tend to remain patent
with adequate flow [1, 15–17].
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used to study the effects of flow diverters
on the hemodynamics of intracranial aneurysms [18–21]. Most of these studies focused on the
intrasaccular flow dynamics and did not consider possible effects on side branches and perforators.
Furthermore, most of these CFD studies used outflow boundary conditions (traction free conditions
or prescribed flows) that are not adequate for modeling flow changes in jailed branches. Only few
previous CFD and in vitro studies have focused on the effects of flow diverters on side branches and
perforators [22–24]. One study based on image-based CFD models suggested that reductions in the
flow rates through jailed arteries may be small even for large percent occlusion of the branch origin
[22]. This previous study however did not include subject-specific flow conditions, used somewhat
idealized stent geometries, and did not relate the calculated flow reductions to follow up exams. The
purpose of our study was to analyze the flow alteration produced by flow diverting devices placed
across the origin of side arterial branches in rabbit models and its relationship to the subsequent
patency of these branches.
2. METHODS
The alterations in the blood flow through arteries that have been jailed by flow diverting devices
were studied using image-based CFD in rabbit models. CFD models were created using subjectspecific
vascular geometries reconstructed from 3D anatomical images and physiologic conditions
derived from DUS velocity measurements. Blood flow simulations were carried out before and after
implantation of flow diverter models to quantify the hemodynamic changes in jailed arteries. The
methodology is schematically presented in Figure 1, and details are provided in what follows.
2.1. Animal models and imaging
A total of four rabbit models [25] were used to investigate the effects of flow diverting devices on
the flow in jailed side branches. A flow diverter (Pipeline Embolization Device, Covidien Inc., CA)
was deployed in the aorta across the origin of the lumbar arteries. Two days before treatment, the
subjects were premedicated with aspirin (10 mg/kg PO) and clopidogrel (10 mg/kg PO). This medication
regime was continued for 1 month after treatment. Three-dimensional rotational angiography
(3DRA) images were acquired before and after implantation of the flow diverting devices. Before
treatment, the flow velocity was measured with DUS in the aorta at locations proximal and distal to
the location of the flow diverter as well as in the jailed side branches. No flow measurements were
available after treatment. The subjects were observed for 8 weeks and subsequently sacrificed with

a lethal injection of pentobarbital. Immediately prior to sacrifice, digital subtraction angiography
images were acquired to determine the position of the flow diverter and whether the jailed branches
were still open and adequately perfused. Immediately after sacrifice, the portion of the aorta containing
the flow diverter was harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The rabbits
employed in this study were used as part of another investigation, where aneurysms were created in
the innominate artery and subsequently treated with flow diverters.
2.2. Scanning electron microscopy
After fixation, the flow diverter implanted arteries were gently opened to expose the ostium of the
lumbar artery and processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the patency of lumbar
arteries was analyzed with a JEOL 6400 SEM (JEOL, Ltd).
2.3. Vascular and device modeling
Subject-specific models of the aorta and its major side branches were constructed from the 3DRA
images acquired prior to FD deployment using previously described methods [26]. The vascular
models were manually edited using itksnap (www.itksnap.org) to ensure proper representation of
the topology and geometry of the arteries. The models were then smoothed [27] and truncated
perpendicularly to the vessel axes keeping as much as possible of the proximal parent artery [28].
All outlets were extruded five vessel diameters in order to model the resistance of the distal vascular
beds (see later). Unstructured grids were then generated with a minimum resolution of 0.2 mm
resulting in a total of 2.0 million to 2.5 million linear tetrahedral elements. These grids were used to
compute the flow dynamics before treatment and are denoted ‘pre-Tx’ grids.

ANALYSIS OF FLOW CHANGES IN SIDE BRANCHES JAILED BY FLOW DIVERTERS 991
Computer models of FD devices deployed in each subject were created and placed within the
vascular model of each subject. The method used to perform the virtual deployment of the FD
devices consists of the following steps [29]: (i) extraction of the vessel centerline from the vascular
model; (ii) creation of a cylindrical surface along the vessel centerline completely contained within
the vessel; (iii) expansion of this cylindrical surface until it contacts the vessel walls or reaches the
device reference diameter; and (iv) mapping of the device design onto the deformed cylindrical surface
taking into account foreshortening effects due to possible device oversizing [30]. The devices
deployed consisted in 48 wires braided into rhomboidal cells with an angle of 150o in its reference
configuration. Once the devices were placed within the vascular models, the computational grids
were adaptively refined around the wires. Four levels of h-refinement were applied to mesh elements
crossed by the wire surface. The resulting grids contained between 17 million and 25 million tetrahedral
elements. These grids were used to compute the flow dynamics after FD treatment and are
denoted ‘post-Tx’ grids.
2.4. Blood flow modeling
The blood flow dynamics was mathematically modeled with the 3D unsteady Navier–Stokes
equations [31]. Blood was modeled as an incompressible Newtonian fluid with density
p D 1:0 g/cm3 and viscosity  D 0:04 Poise. The governing equations were discretized in space
using a second order upwind finite element formulation on unstructured grids and integrated in time
using a fully implicit scheme [32]. The discretized pressure equation was numerically solved with
a preconditioned deflated conjugate gradients algorithm designed to increase the efficiency of the
solver in tubular domains [33]. For each model, two calculations were carried out to represent the
flow dynamics before and after deployment of the FD devices across the side branches. In the post-
Tx cases, an immersed unstructured grids method was employed to compute the flow around the
device wires on the adaptively refined grids [34].
2.5. Flow measurements
Subject-specific physiologic flow conditions were derived from pretreatment DUS velocity measurements.
The inflow waveform was reconstructed from a corresponding DUS measurement
obtained in the aorta proximally from the jailed side branch. The peak velocity was obtained from
the envolvent curve of the DUS profile and the flow rate by assuming a parabolic profile and multiplying
by the vessel cross-sectional area. The flow rates through the branches that were later jailed
during treatment were similarly calculated from DUS measurements performed in those arteries.
The pretreatment flow division from the aorta to the side branch was calculated as the ratio of
mean flow in the jailed branch and the aorta. Before treatment, the flow through the side branch
was approximately between 1% and 3% of the aortic flow. Flow divisions between the aorta and
other branches in the model, where flow measurements were not available, were approximated by
the ratio of the vessel areas to the 2/3 power, which corresponds to the principle of minimum work
(Murray’s law [35]).
2.6. Boundary conditions
At the model inlet, the measured pulsatile flow rate was prescribed using the Womersley velocity
profile [36]. The resistances of the distal vascular beds were modeled as a porous region added at the
end of each branch by extrusion. The porosity values were calculated to reproduce the pretreatment
flow divisions. At the model outlets (after extrusion), the pressure was set to zero, approximating
the pressure of the distal venous system.
Physiologically, flow divisions are determined by the ratio of flow resistances Q0=Qi D Ri=R0,
where Q0 is the mean aortic flow rate, while Qi is the mean flow rate through branch i, R0 is
the resistance of the vascular bed distal of the aorta, and Ri is the resistance of the vascular bed
distal of branch i. The distal aortic resistance R0 was estimated from the measured mean aortic
flow rate Q0 and by assuming a mean pressure in the aorta of approximately 100 mmHg [37]:
P D Q0  R0, where P is the pressure drop from the aorta to the distal capillary bed. The

resistances of all other branches were then calculated from the corresponding pretreatment flow
divisions: Ri D Q0=Qi  R0.
In order to model the resistance of the distal vascular bed corresponding to each model outlet, the
computational domain was extended by extruding each outlet. Each of these cylindrical domains
was considered as a porous material. The corresponding porosity was calculated in order to match
the desired resistance assuming a pressure drop from the aorta to the capillary bed of 100 mmHg
[37], Pi D Qi  Ri, and using Darcy’s law [38]: i D Ri  Li=Ai, where i is the porosity, Ai
is the outlet area, and Li is the extrusion length (taken as five times the outlet diameter).
In order to estimate the change in the flow rate through the jailed branch after implantation of
the FD device, the inflow rate and distal flow resistances were kept at the pretreatment values.
This assumes that the physiologic conditions and the distal resistances do not significantly change
after FD treatment. However, the flow rate through the jailed branch after treatment will change
because of the added resistance provided by the FD wire mesh at the origin of the jailed branch.
The assumption of no change in the resistance of the distal vascular bed implies no autoregulation.
If autoregulation mechanisms are at play, they would tend to lower the distal resistance in order to
increase the flow through the jailed branch [39]; therefore, the assumption of equal resistances after
treatment corresponds to a worst case scenario.
3. RESULTS
Numerical simulations of the blood flow in jailed arteries of four rabbit models were successfully
carried out using porous materials to approximate the resistances of the distal vascular beds, thus
allowing the calculation of flow alterations in these branches. The vascular models constructed
from 3DRA images of each rabbit are presented in Figure 2. This figure shows the geometry of the
reconstructed vessels and the FD devices deployed across side branches (left column), the geometry
of the FD devices after virtual deployment into the vascular models (center column), and ex vivo
gross anatomy pictures of the portion of the aorta containing the flow diverter and the jailed branch
(right column). In one case (subject 2), compaction of the FD device was observed angiographically
during the treatment (images not shown). This resulted in a denser mesh near the origin of the side
branch, as can be observed in the corresponding ex vivo images. Thus, the virtual deployment in
this case was adjusted. The length of the portion of the stent that compacted was measured on the
angiography and ex vivo images and the cell angles of the computational model were adjusted to
account for the corresponding foreshortening. Cell angles were changed from 150o of the reference
design to 172o in the deployed model.
Cell angles were measured on the computational models, the ex vivo gross anatomy images, and
SEM image (Figure 6), using the freeware software tool MB-Ruler (http://www.markus-bader.de/
MB-Ruler/index.php). The results are presented in Table I. These results indicate that in general,
the cell geometries obtained in the computational models with the virtual deployment are in good
agreement with the cell geometries observed ex vivo. The largest differences (about 25%) were
observed for case 1 where the ex vivo images showed lower cell angles. This could be due to
expansion of the artery diameter due to the FD implantation or to changes in the vessel and device
geometry when harvesting the sample. In the other three cases, the differences were below a few
percent.
Visualizations of the blood flows in the vicinity of the jailed branches before and after treatment
are presented in Figure 3. This figure presents from top to bottom: iso-velocity surfaces
(v D 10 cm/s) before and after treatment, peak systole flow streamlines before and after treatment,
and peak systole velocity contours on a cut-plane before and after treatment. Different subjects are
shown in each column. It can be seen that the deployment of the FD devices caused relatively small
reductions in the blood flow speed in the jailed branches. Additionally, before treatment, the
flow patterns into the side branches were smooth with no recirculation regions. After treatment,
the flow patterns remained smooth with no new major recirculation regions. Small perturbations of
the flow structure were observed near the device wires, and in particular, small regions of flow acceleration
were observed at the device cells. No regions of disturbed flows that could induce thrombus
formation were observed.

DUS velocity measurements performed in the side branches. These graphs show that the flow rates
were quite similar during diastole and that the maximum reductions occurred near the systolic peak.

The percent area occlusion of the jailed branch was geometrically estimated by calculating the area
of the cylinder used for the virtual deployment covered by the device wires, taking into account the
wire diameter, the cell size and angle, and discounting the intersection between wires. Relatively
modest reductions of the mean flow rates (between 9% and 20%) and peak flows (between 15% and

4. DISCUSSION
One of the major concerns with the use of flow diverting devices to treat intracranial aneurysms
is the possible occlusion of perforators or other arteries and subsequent infarction of the portion
of the brain fed by these arteries. This is the main reason why flow diverting devices need to be
porous. Their design should be able to significantly disrupt the blood flow into the aneurysm and
promote its complete thrombosis while at the same time maintain adequate blood flow through jailed
side branches. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of currently available flow
diverters on the blood flow in side branches using rabbit models.
The results of this study showed that jailed branches remained patent 8 weeks after implantation
of the FD. Angiographically, these branches exhibited adequate filling with contrast material.
However, it is unknown if they underwent through a stage of occlusion followed by recanalization,
or if thrombo-embolic events were generated, which could potentially lead to stroke when treating
cerebral aneurysms in humans. SEM images demonstrated partial coverage of the ostia of the jailed
side branches with endothelial tissue. Image-based CFD models that used both subject-specific vascular
geometries and physiologic flow conditions predicted relatively small or moderate reductions
in the flow rate through the jailed branches. This was observed even for large blockage of the orifice
where these branches originate.
Small reductions in the flow through jailed branches could be explained by the large resistances
of the distal vascular beds. In order to significantly alter the flow rate through a jailed branch, a
resistance comparable to the distal resistance (which could be thought of as resistors in series) needs
to be created by the flow diverter at the origin of the branch. This only happens when the FD covers a
significant portion of the area of the orifice [22]. In aneurysms, the situation is different because the
wire mesh of the flow diverter covers the opening of a closed cavity, thus significantly affecting the

intrasaccular flow and creating stagnation conditions that, together with the presence of the metallic
mesh, induce thrombus formation and subsequent aneurysm occlusion.
Clinical reports of branch artery occlusion following FD treatment are relatively rare. Puffer
et al. [40] demonstrated that one fourth of ophthalmic arteries covered by single or multiple PED
ultimately occluded but were not associated with clinical symptoms. Case reports of symptomatic
branch artery occlusions following PED therapy are rare [41]. Ischemic complications in the posterior
circulation appear to be higher than that in the anterior circulation, which might be related to
perforator ischemia [14]. It is noteworthy, however, that reports of anterior choroidal territory infarction
following jailing of that vessel with flow diverters remain absent from the literature, suggesting
that the preclinical findings of our study are concordant with clinical experience. A recent metaanalysis
of FD treatment of intracranial aneurysms reported a perforator infarction rate of 3%, with
a significantly lower incidence among patients with cerebral aneurysms in the anterior circulation
than those in the posterior circulation [14].
There are a number of limitations and approximations that could affect the results of this study
and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings presented here. First, the flow
diverters were implanted in the rabbit aorta, which has similar size as human intracranial arteries
, but the jailed branches are not as small as human perforating arteries. In the current study, all
side branches had similar sizes. However, it is possible that in branches of smaller caliber or with
lower distal resistances, larger flow reductions may be obtained. Second, because the animal models
were created for other purposes, no flow measurements were performed after implantation of the
FD devices; thus, it was not possible to compare the results of the CFD models directly to in vivo
measurements. Third, only hydrodynamic effects were included in the models; other effects such as
thrombosis or thrombo-embolic complications were not studied. The results of this study suggest
that complications related to flow reductions may not be the most important. Other effects related
to tissue growth across the FD device or clotting and thrombosis may be more important sources of
complications. Fourth, in this small series, none of the jailed branches occluded after treatment; thus,
it was not possible to determine the conditions under which jailed branches are likely to occlude.
This study only provides information about hemodynamic conditions under which these branches
are likely to remain patent, which include typical clinical scenarios. Future studies should consider
larger percent occlusions of the branch origin, for example by deployment of several devices and/or
jailing smaller branches. Fifth, the geometries of the FD were approximated with a virtual deployment
technique. Although this technique accounts for foreshortening effects due to oversizing, it
does not take into account possible device compaction or stretching due to catheter manipulations
performed by the operator when releasing the actual devices. High vessel curvatures, tapering, and
tortuosity can also affect the final geometry of the device cells once deployed. Other virtual deployment
techniques may overcome some of these limitations [42, 43]. Finally, the computer models
make several approximations and assumptions including fully developed velocity profiles were used
to impose inflow boundary conditions, flow rate waveforms were derived from peak velocity measurements
performed with DUS, and distal resistances were estimated from measured flow divisions
and prescribed using porous materials. Our models assumed rigid walls; therefore, the key parameters
to determine the flow through each branch were the resistances of the distal vascular beds. Using
porous media to model the distal resistances may introduce inertia effects in the extruded regions.
These effects can induce phase differences between the waveforms through the different branches
of the model. In our simulations, these differences were not significant because the porous regions
were relatively small (5-diameter extrusions), thus adding only small inertia effects. Nevertheless, it
was verified that our choice of boundary conditions and porosity parameters was able to reproduce
the flow velocities measured in vivo prior to treatment. Despite all these limitations, the computational
models predicted relatively small reductions of the flow rates in the jailed arteries, consistent
with angiographic observations that showed that these vessels remained open with adequate filling.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Flow diverting devices seem to be safe with respect to perforator or side branch occlusion. Relatively
small changes in the flow rate through jailed arteries are expected even for moderate to large block-

clinical observations and experiences where no or very few complications related to perforator
occlusion have been reported.
