ABSTRACT. This study examined the effects of N-ethylmaleimidesensitive
factor (NSF) small interfering RNA (siRNA) on cardiac 
function following myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Thirty-six adult 
Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three equivalent groups. 
An acute MI model was established by ligating the anterior descending 
branch of the left coronary artery and confirmed by electrocardiogram. 
Recombinant NSF-siRNA adenovirus (experimental), negative 
adenovirus (control), and normal saline were injected near the infarcted 
area of the left ventricle in each respective group. The left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with a noninvasive ultrasonic 
cardiogram. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and the 
maximum rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (+dp/dt max) were 
measured using the BL-420 Biological Functional Experimental 
System. Hearts were sectioned and stained with 2,3,5,-triphenyl 
tetrazolium chloride (TTC) to observe the MI area. Two weeks after

surgery, LVEF in the experimental group (46.0 ± 7.5%) was higher than 
control (34.0 ± 6.0%) and saline (37.5 ± 4.5%) group LVEFs (P < 0.05), 
whereas LVEDP was the lowest in the experimental group (18.51 ± 
6.87 vs 29.47 ± 9.94 and 26.58 ± 8.97 mmHg, respectively) (P < 0.05). 
The +dp/dt max was also higher in the experimental group (9.74 ± 1.16 
vs 4.33 ± 1.19 and 5.24 ± 1.53 mmHg/s x 103, respectively) (P < 0.05); 
however, the MI area did not differ significantly between groups. Local 
injection of an adenovirus-mediated NSF-siRNA expression vector 
near infarcted areas improved cardiac function two weeks after MI, but 
had no impact on the MI area.

INTRODUCTION
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is an important protein in endothelial cells 
that might mediate the merging of Weibel Palade bodies (WPBs) with the endothelial cell 
membrane. This juncture results in exocytosis and the release of WPB contents, primarily 
consisting of vasoactive substances such as von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, endothelin-1, 
and interleukin-8. These substances are released in the early stage of vascular injury. During 
this stage, neutrophils adhere to the blood vessel endothelium, and platelet aggregation occurs
along with a series of inflammatory responses on the vascular wall such as vasospasms. 
These factors are closely related to the occurrence of atherosclerosis and of acute coronary 
syndrome (Lowenstein et al., 2005; Lowenstein and Tsuda, 2006). Our research group has 
studied the mechanism and regulation of WPB release (Yang et al., 2004), and we have successfully
cloned the NSF gene of human aortic endothelial cells and constructed a recombinant 
adenovirus vector containing an NSF small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets the region of 
the gene encoding the NSF protein N-terminal functional domain in human aortic endothelial 
cells. After DNA sequencing and viral titering, we transfected the recombinant adenovirus 
NSF-siRNA vector into human aortic endothelial cells. Expression of NSF mRNA and protein 
was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot technology at different 
time points. We found that NSF-siRNA induced a reduction in NSF mRNA expression and 
decreased NSF protein synthesis, thus restraining the release of WPBs.
Based on previous studies, we established a myocardial infarction (MI) model in rats, 
and injected the recombinant adenovirus NSF-siRNA vector at multiple sites around the area 
of MI. We then observed the cardiac function and MI area after two weeks to evaluate the effects
of NSF-siRNA on hearts following MI.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Material
We purchased 36 specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 180-
220 g from the Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) 
(qualification certificate No.: 11400700010718; laboratory animal application license No.:

SCXK [J.] 2012-0001). The rats were fed with dedicated feed (Beijing Vital River Laboratory 
Animal Technology Co., Ltd.) in a sterilized moist cage with a barrier system.
Methods
Construction and preparation of the adenovirus NSF small hairpin RNA
(Adv-NSF-shRNA) vector
The NSF gene sequence was selected from GenBank (accession No. NM_021748.1). 
Using the software siRNA Target Designer version 1.51, interfering oligonucleotide sequences 
targeting the N-terminal region of the NSF gene were designed, along with the positive-sense 
and antisense strands of the siRNA. The sequences were connected with a looped oligonucleotide
(10 nt) to constitute a short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
It is thought that the synthesis of two single strands of a DNA template encoding 
a shRNA might help achieve a DNA double-strand template of shRNA by single-strand 
annealing. An RNA III polymerase transcription termination site was connected to the 
template strand. MluI and HindIII enzyme cleavage sites were designed into the two termini
, which were utilized to clone the shRNA molecule between the MluI and HindIII 
restriction sites of the multi-cloning site on the siRNA adenovirus pRNAT-H1.1/Adeno 
(SD1219) vector.
Following double digestion of the SD1219 vector with MluI and HindIII, the linear 
vector was obtained by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The linear vector was then connected 
to the NSF-shRNA DNA template via the corresponding restriction sites on both termini via 
T4 ligase. DH5α competent bacteria were transfected by the ligated product, and inoculated 
into Luria-Bertani-kanamycin culture medium at 37°C and cultivated overnight. Bacteria were 
isolated, and plasmid DNA was extracted using a plasmid extraction kit (Shanghai Shinegene 
Company, Shanghai, China) and labeled for cryopreservation after digestion and sequencing 
identification with MluI and HindIII. The purification and identification of Adv- NSF-shRNA 
were achieved as previously described (Ming, 2011). Viral titering was conducted using the 
50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) method.
MI modeling
The MI model was established by ligating the anterior descending branch of the coronary
artery in rats, as previously reported (Chen et al., 2010). For this study, thirty-six Sprague-
Dawley rats were weighed, sorted according to their weight, and randomly divided into the 
experimental group (injected with recombinant adenovirus), the control group (injected with 
negative recombinant adenovirus), and the normal saline group (N = 12 in each group). Each 
group was caged together.
A concentration of 0.4 mL/100 g 1% pentobarbital sodium was applied for abdominal
anesthesia, and the BL-420 Biological Functional Experimental System (Beijing Loled 
Science Traffic Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) was attached onto the subject animal to record 
the electrocardiogram. Using a tracheal cannula, a thoracotomy was conducted between 
the fourth and fifth left ribs. The HX-300S respirator (Chengdu Technology & Market Co., 
Ltd., Chengdu, China) was then connected, with a breathing frequency of 80 times/min, a 
2:1 respiratory quotient, and 7-10 mL tidal volume which was adjusted according to the

inflation of the lungs. The anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was tied 
with 8-0 noninvasive silk thread by inserting a needle to a depth of 0.2-0.4 mm. After the 
branch had been tied off, the antetheca and apex of the left ventricle turned pale. By electrocardiographic
monitoring, observation of ST segment elevation in the V1 lead suggested 
that successful ligation had occurred.
After successful modeling, the experimental group was injected with 1.2 x 109 TU/
mL NSF-siRNA adenovirus at the top, bottom, and right and left sides of the left ventricular 
free wall, with 50 μL injected at each point for a 200-μL total injection volume. The negative
control and normal saline groups were administered the same amount of negative control 
adenovirus and 0.9% NaCl, respectively. After dosing, the chest was sewn with 0 silk thread 
sutures, and residual blood was extracted. Negative pressure was maintained in the chest as the 
breathing machine was removed, and the muscle and skin were stitched. The tracheal cannula 
was reserved for preventing blockage of the airway after surgery. Furthermore, warm light and 
a hot-water bottle were used to maintain the body temperature of the rats. After revival from 
anesthesia, a small amount of clean water was provided to the rats, and the tracheal cannula 
was removed. Rats in the same experimental group were returned to their shared cage, and 
observed for 4 h after surgery. Penicillin was injected into the muscle 5 days after surgery to 
prevent infection.
Measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with ultrasonic cardiogram
The rats were weighed again after 2 weeks, 0.4 mL/100 g 1% pentobarbital sodium 
was applied for abdominal anesthesia, and the electrocardiogram was recorded. After anesthesia
, the LVEF values of the rats were measured with an ultrasonic cardiogram.
Measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and the maximum 
rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (+dp/dt max)
LVEDP and +dp/dt max were measured using the BL-420 Biological Functional Experimental
System. After anesthesia, the rats were placed on their backs. Tubing was placed 
into the left ventricular space through the right external carotid artery, and this tubing was 
filled with 1250 0U/L heparin sodium normal saline diluent. The tubing was then connected 
to the Biological Functional Experimental System, and the LVEDP and +dp/dt max values 
of the left ventricles of the rats were measured. A pressure transducer was placed at the same 
level as the left ventricle, and a zero setting was used before and after measurements to ensure 
reliability of the data.
TTC staining
Following determination of cardiac function outcome measurements, the rats were 
sacrificed and their hearts were dissected and washed repeatedly with ice brine. The connec -
tive tissue on the surface of the heart was removed, and then serial sections were cut. The sections
were stained with 2% TTC solution for 20 min in the dark in a shaking water bath with 
constant temperature (37°C). The sections were photographed and the software ImageJ was 
used to determine the MI area.

Statistical analysis
Data are reported as means ± standard deviation. A homogeneity test of variance was 
conducted with the SPSS 16.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). If the variances 
were not even, variable conversion was performed to reach homogeneity. The t-test was used 
for inter-group comparisons and P < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Construction and preparation of Adv-NSF-shRNA
The oligonucleotide sequence used to target the N-terminal region of the NSF gene 
was 5'-TAG GAC TGG TCG TTG GAA ACA-3' (21 nt) (Figure 1). The viral titer calculated 
using TCID50 was 1.2 x 1010 TU/mL.
Figure 1. shRNA sequence diagram. An extra “G” (green arrow) was added to the beginning of the construct, as 
RNA Polymerase III prefers to initiate transcription with a purine.
MI modeling results
An electrocardiogram was used to monitor the arterial ligation operation. First, the normal
V1 lead was recorded (Figure 2A). During the operation, ST segment elevation in the V1 
lead indicated successful ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery 
(Figure 2B). Two weeks later, a pathological Q wave was observed in the V1 lead (Figure 2C).

A total of 36 rats with acute MI were prepared for the monitoring experiments. During
surgery, six died from arrhythmia, and 3 days after the surgery, eight died from malignant 
arrhythmia. Only 22 rats survived until the end of the experiment. Of these, 8 rats survived in 
the normal saline group, and 7 rats survived in each of the control and experimental groups. 
The survival rate was 61.1%, and none of the rats became infected after the surgery. After 
the experiment, failure of MI modeling was confirmed in two rats by hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) staining. Therefore, these animals (1 rat each in the normal saline and the experimental 
groups) were excluded from the study. Among the rats that survived surgery, the success rate 
of MI modeling was 90.9%.
LVEF values
There were significant differences in LVEF among the groups (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
Currently, the morbidity of acute MI is showing an increasing trend across the world. 
As chronic heart failure often occurs after MI, the protection of cardiac function after MI has 
become an important clinical research topic.
As previously mentioned, various studies have shown that NSF plays a vital role 
in thrombogenesis, inflammatory responses, and vasospasm (Lowenstein et al., 2005; Low -
enstein and Tsuda, 2006). The function of NSF and its regulation have been well studied 
(Matsushita et al., 2005; Cipriano et al., 2013). NSF-siRNA can induce a decrease in NSF
mRNA expression and decrease the synthesis of NSF protein, thus restricting the release of 
WPBs in endothelial cells. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which genes are silenced 
by short oligonucleotides complementary to the target region, most commonly through posttranscriptional
interactions with mRNA. RNAi technology is an emerging strategy to block 
gene production. Experimentally, long double-stranded RNA molecules are split into siRNA 
oligonucleotides by the endogenous Dicer enzyme after being imported into the cell. These 
efficiently combine with the target gene mRNA molecules and interfere with protein transla -
tion; thus, siRNAs have been used for such diverse functions as curing disease or investigating
the function of a target gene. Compared to technologies such as targeted gene knockout 
or the use of pharmaceutical agents, which often have non-specific effects, RNAi offers many 
advantages for the research of functional gene groups and related aspects (Matsushita et al., 
2005; Cipriano et al., 2013). Based on previous studies, we established MI modeling in rats 
and injected the recombinant adenovirus NSF-siRNA around the infarcted area. Two weeks 
after MI, we found that the cardiac function indices of the experimental group were signifi -
cantly superior to those in the control and the normal saline groups. The mechanism involved 
might be related to the local injection of NSF-siRNA after MI, a restriction of NSF target 
gene expression, a decreased release of WPBs, a decline in thrombus and inflammatory factor 
levels, weakening of myocardial stunning, or myocardial hibernation effects, as well as to the

preservation of cardiac function in semi-infarcted areas. The results suggest that RNAi technology
has great value in research and for future applications for the prevention and treatment 
of diseases of the cardiovascular system such as atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome. 
In this experiment, no distinct statistical differences in the MI area of each group were 
identified, which might be related to the method used to establish the MI model. Since the liga -
tion of the anterior descending branch is an acute mechanical ligation, the effective collateral 
circulation cannot be established within a short period, which might result in the treatment 
being insufficient to decrease the MI area.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that adenovirus vector-mediated RNA interference
effectively improved cardiac function in rats following MI. This result might contribute 
to the development of a micro-molecule RNA drug. RNAi might also constitute a new approach
for treating cardiovascular disease in the future. However, some of the components 
of recombinant vectors might give rise to host immunoreaction; in addition, various other 
factors need to be determined prior to clinical use of this technology such as the time of active 
duration, ideal selection of a vacant vector, selection of helper virus qualities, viral purifica -
tion, and biological security. Therefore, RNAi as a clinical treatment measure still has many 
problems that need to be overcome (Sioud, 2011; Hsu and Yang, 2014). The solution to these 
problems might be reliant upon further basic and clinical research in the future.
