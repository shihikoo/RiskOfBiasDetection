ABSTRACT
A large number of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke have large artery intracranial
occlusions, and timely recanalization of these occlusions often leads to improved neurologic outcome.
Starting with the widespread use of IV tissue plasminogen activator, a wide variety of
pharmacologic and mechanical methods have been introduced to improve vessel recanalization
and clinical outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke, which include endovascular therapies
such as intra-arterial thrombolytics and mechanical thrombectomy devices. One of the potential
therapies is angioplasty and stenting, and this has been evaluated in multiple case reports and
small series published by various centers regarding its use in this setting. In this article, we review
the current literature on stenting with and without angioplasty, used alone or as a part of multimodal
therapy for recanalization for acute cerebrovascular occlusions. Neurology® 2012;79

Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States, affecting 700,000 people
each year.1 Approximately 87% of these strokes are ischemic, in which a critical reduction in
cerebral blood flow leads to brain infarction.1 A majority of patients presenting with acute
ischemic stroke (AIS) have large artery intracranial occlusions, and timely recanalization of
these occlusions often leads to improved neurologic outcome. Starting with the widespread use
of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a wide variety of pharmacologic and mechanical
methods have been introduced to improve vessel recanalization and clinical outcome of patients
with AIS, which include endovascular therapies such as intra-arterial (IA) thrombolytics
and the Merci and Penumbra systems.1–7 One of the potential therapies is angioplasty and
stenting, and this has been evaluated in multiple case reports and small series published by
various centers regarding its use in this setting. Here we review the current literature on
stenting, with and without angioplasty, used alone or as a part of multimodal therapy for
recanalization for acute cerebrovascular occlusions.
METHODSWe performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search of the English-language literature (key words: intracranial stenting, AIS,
self-expanding intracranial stent, endovascular therapy, multimodal therapy, mechanical recanalization, stenting and angioplasty,
acute cerebrovascular occlusion) and reviewed relevant publications from the period January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2011. The literature
search yielded a total of 717 abstracts. For further analysis, we excluded abstracts that dealt with extracranial carotid stenting,
mechanical methods except stenting, and stenting when it was done beyond 24 hours of symptom onset for preocclusive or occlusive
lesions. Using these criteria, we selected 26 articles for further analysis. After further review, we excluded articles with multimodal
therapy in which separate data for angioplasty and stenting were not available. A total of 8 articles were included in our review, with
data available for the following: NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time of intervention, type of stent used, periprocedural intracerebral
hemorrhage, mortality, and favorable clinical outcome.

RESULTS Demographics and lesion characteristics.
A total of 127 patients were included, of which 59
(46.4%) were men. Mean age (SD) was 66.15.5
years. Mean time to intervention was 320  129
minutes. Mean or median NIHSS scores were reported
in the range of 14–19. Anterior circulation
was involved in 105 cases (82.7%) and posterior circulation
in 22 cases (17.3%) (table 1).
Procedural details.IV, IA, or combined thrombolytic
therapy (tPA or urokinase) was used in 75 patients
(59%). A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide
or abciximab) was used for 88 (69.3%) of the 127
reported. Prior manipulation with other mechanical
therapies, such as the Merci retriever (Concentric
Medical, Mountain View, CA), snare devices, an aspiration
catheter (Vasco35, Balt, Montmorency,
France), or the Catch thromboembolectomy system
(Balt), was used in 43 (33.8%) of the 108 patients
reported (not reported in 1 article; see table 1). Preprocedural
or postprocedural balloon angioplasty
was performed in 54 (50%) of the 108 patients reported
(not reported in 1 article; see table 1). Stent
systems used included balloon-mounted coronary
stents in 23 patients (18.1%), Wingspan in 50
(39.4%), Neuroform (Boston Neurovascular, Fremont
, CA) in 32 (25.2%), and Enterprise (Codman
Neurovascular J and J, Boston, MA) in 22 (17.3%)
(table 1).
Successful recanalization, defined as postprocedural
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI)
grade 2–3, was achieved in 113 patients (89%),
whereas 14 patients (11%) had a residual TIMI
grade of 0–1. A total of 26 procedures (20.5%) had
hemorrhagic complication (parenchymal/subarachnoid
), of which 12 (9.4%) were reported as symptomatic.
Overall mortality was 29.9% (38/127)
(table 2).
Outcome data. Clinical outcome data in these 8 articles
were reported as follows: modified Rankin
Scale (mRS) score at discharge or at 30 days, mRS
score at 90 days, or NIHSS score improvement
4. An mRS score3 at discharge or 30 days was
reported in 5 articles, and 48.8% of the 86 patients
had a good outcome. An mRS score3at
90 days was reported in 3 articles, in a total of 16
(41%) of 39 patients. One article reported NIHSS
score improvement4 occurred in 15 (75%) of
20 patients (table 2).
DISCUSSION The combination of angioplasty and
stenting has been successfully used for treatment of
occlusive coronary lesions in both elective and acute
settings.8 However, its use in the intracranial circulation
is only a decade old, and it has mostly been
studied for the treatment of severe intracranial atherosclerotic
disease.9 The use of intracranial stenting
for AIS was introduced as part of multimodal therapy
for lesions that were resistant to treatment by other
methods of mechanical revascularization. Since then,
there have been several case series that have studied
the use of this technique in this setting, revealing
good recanalization rates, especially for proximal lesions
such as carotid T lesions, which are recalcitrant
to recanalization.
Time window. It has been well-established that time
to recanalization is one of the most important predictors
for improved mortality and morbidity in stroke
patients.10Since the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial, IV tPA has

been the cornerstone of therapy in AIS.10 However,
even after 15 years of implementation, few AIS patients
receive IV tPA.11The recent extension of the time window
for administering IV tPA to 4.5 hours will possibly
help in increasing the access to this therapy,12 but the
clinical impact of this extended time window still remains
to be seen. Following the NINDS trial, several IA
trials (Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism
[PROACT] I and II)2,3 and trials of combined IA and
IV thrombolytics (Interventional Management of
Stroke [IMS I and II])4 were conducted, extending the
time window of ischemic stroke treatment to 6 hours.
Median time to therapy for PROACT II was 5.3 hours,
whereas mean time to therapy for the IMS I trial was
217 minutes, or 3 hours and 37 minutes.13 Thereafter,
mechanical means of recanalization for acute cerebrovascular
occlusions such as the Merci retriever5,6and the
Penumbra7,13 systems further extended the time window
for recanalization to 8 hours for the anterior circulation.
Median time to recanalization for the pooled
data of Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia
(MERCI) and Multi-MERCI trials was reported
to be 4.3 hours for a total of 305 patients.5–7,13 In our
pooled data for 127 patients, the mean time to recanalization
was 320 minutes, or 5 hours and 20 minutes,
putting stenting well within the range of the 8-hour
window. Current studies are trying to extend this time
window for a certain subset of patients, based on the
advanced imaging protocol.14 As the science of perfusion
imaging advances, these windows are bound to advance
, which will significantly improve access to
thrombectomy therapy for a significant number of
stroke patients.
Recanalization rates. Following an acute stroke, recanalization
along with the presenting NIHSS score
is the best predictor for a good outcome.15 Even
though IV tPA is the primary mode of therapy for
strokes presenting in the first 4.5 hours, recanalization
rates with IV thrombolytics have been reported
to be only about 10% in proximal internal carotid
artery occlusions and 30% in middle cerebral artery
occlusions.13 The use of IA therapy in PROACT I
and II advanced these rates to 57.7% for middle cerebral
artery M1 and M2 lesions.7,13,16 However, the use
of IA thrombolytics in PROACT I and II was limited
to only middle cerebral artery lesions.2,3 Combination
therapy in IMS I and II achieved rates of thrombolysis
in cerebral infarction grade 2–3 in 61.3% of cases.7,13,16
Use of the Merci retriever with adjunctive therapy further
advanced the recanalization rates to 64.6%, and
even in lesions of the proximal internal carotid artery the
rates were 62.6%. A major gain in the recanalization rates
was shown in the use of the Penumbra system, where rates
of 81.6% were observed with the adjunctive use of IA
thrombolytic therapy. In our analysis, 89% of the lesions
treated had a recanalization TIMI grade of 2–3, and in
studies published after 2008, this rate was as high as
92.5%, suggesting the possibility that stenting might be
superior to other methods of endovascular recanalization.
Postprocedural morbidity and mortality. When compared
to the placebo group with a symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage rate of 0.6%, patients receiving
IV tPA had a hemorrhage rate of 6.4%.10 The rate
following use of IA prourokinase in the PROACT II
trial was 10.9% in the treatment group,3,13 whereas
in the combined groups of the IMS I and II trials the
rates were 6.3% to 9.9%.4 Data from the MERCI
and Multi-MERCI trials had symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage rates of 7.8% to 9.8%, and this rate
increased to 11.2% with use of the Penumbra Aspira-

tion System.13 In the current pooled analysis we
found that this rate was 9.4%.
Another important outcome measure reported in
these studies was mortality. The mortality at 3 months
for the NINDS placebo group was 24%.16 The mortality
rates for various chemical thrombolysis groups, namely, IV
tPA, PROACT I, PROACT II, and the IMS I and II trial
groups, were 21%, 26.9%, 25%, and 16%, respectively.7,13,16 For the mechanical means the data were reported
to be 43.5%, 34%, and 32.8% for the MERCI,
Multi-MERCI, and Penumbra systems, respectively.13
Mortality in our study group was 30%, comparable to that
with other mechanical methods of recanalization.
Favorable clinical outcome. The studies we included
did not all report the same outcome variable for clinical
outcome, which made comparison to data from
other studies difficult. Also, a good functional outcome
in most of these studies was defined by an mRS
score of3, whereas in all studies including NINDS
it was defined by an mRS score2. Three studies
reported data on mRS scores3 only at discharge or
30 days, and in these studies this outcome was
achieved in 49% of patients. Three other studies reported
data for the 3-month follow-up, and their
pooled results showed an mRS score3 in 41% of
patients. One study reported only a change in
NIHSS score by4 points at time of discharge as
the good functional outcome measure, and this finding
was seen in 75% of cases in that study. Whereas
in the NINDS trial only 33% of patients had a good
functional outcome (mRS scores 2),10 in the IA
trials (PROACT and IMS), good functional outcome
(mRS scores2) was achieved in 40% to 46%
of patients.7,16 Rates from the Multi-MERCI and
Penumbra trials were lower; good outcomes (mRS
scores2) were seen in only 36% and 25% of patients
, respectively.7
The only available prospective trial in our series,
the SARIS study by Levy at al.,17 reveals that a good
outcome was noted in 60% of patients. In a recent
article, the study investigators reported 6-month outcome
data. A favorable outcome of mRS score3
was seen in 60% of patients, and an mRS score2in
55%; mortality at the end of 6 months was 35%.18
Stenting beyond 8 hours (subacute). Recent reports
have shown that endovascular therapy including
stenting can be done in patients presenting with AIS
beyond 8 hours chosen carefully on the basis of diffusion-perfusion
–based protocols.14,19 These are based
on reports that there is salvageable penumbra sustained
by collateral support. The recanalization rates
reported vary between 90% and 100%, higher than
with most mechanical or chemical methods.20,21 Favorable
outcomes (mRS score3) were observed in
50% to 66% at 3 months, with postprocedure intracranial
hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemorrhage rates
of 10% to 25%.20,21 It is possible that the lesions
treated had an underlying atherosclerotic nidus and
that stenting helped in stabilizing the endothelium
and providing quick and sustained recanalization.
Thus, it appears that stenting can be done beyond 8
hours with reliable safety and efficacy in a carefully
selected population of patients (figures 1 and 2).
Limitations. There are several important limitations
in this review. Most of the studies included are retrospective
case series with few patients, except one. We
excluded the articles and series where stenting was
used as part of multimodal therapy but the role of
stenting/angioplasty was not specified separately.
Figure 1 A 71-year-old man presented with dysarthria, imbalance,
and weakness
NIH Stroke Scale score was 12 on presentation. Angiography showed trickle flow in distal
basilar artery, with occluded distal vertebral artery (A). Revascularization was done with
use of 3.5  12–mm multilink vision and poststenting thrombolysis in cerebral infarction
flow was restored to grade 3 (B). Modified Rankin Scale score was 0 at 3 months.
Figure 2 A 42-year-old man presented with right upper- and
lower-extremity weakness
NIH Stroke Scale score was 9. Angiography revealed complete occlusion of left middle
cerebral artery M1 (A). Poststenting imaging revealed thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3
flow grade restoration (B). Modified Rankin Scale score was 0 at discharge.

Even in the articles included in our analysis, stents
were used after multiple chemical and mechanical
therapies, which makes it difficult to analyze the solitary
impact of stenting. Another limitation was that outcome
measures defined by these studies were often different
, making it difficult to compare these data with
other, historical study data. Most of the lesion treatments
with stents were done as salvage therapy. This
introduces a selection bias in choosing lesions that
would be less amenable to other conventional therapies,
thus influencing the radiologic and possibly the clinical
outcome. In addition, multiple types of stents with different
mechanical properties were included, which in
turn might have influenced the rates of recanalization
and hemorrhage independently.
CONCLUSION A pooled analysis of these data reveals
that stenting with angioplasty can be done
within a reasonable time and often yields recanalization
rates that are quite high. Though incidence of
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was modest,
mortality still continued to be high. We currently
find it difficult to pool data on functional outcomes,
but most studies report an mRS score 3 at discharge
or at 1–3 months for about 41% to 49% of
patients.
