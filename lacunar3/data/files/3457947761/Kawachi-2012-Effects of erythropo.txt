Abstract Erythropoietin (EPO) has recently been shown
to confer cardioprotective effects via angiogenesis and
antiapoptosis. The administration of EPO after myocardial
infarction (MI) reduces infarct size and improves cardiac
function in small animals. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the protective effects of EPO in porcine MI.
Each animal in the EPO group received four injections of
recombinant human EPO (rhEPO; 6000 U per injection) at
2-day intervals, starting after coronary occlusion. Animals
in the control group received saline. Left ventriculography
was performed just after coronary occlusion and at 28 days.
Time-course changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were measured.
The number of vessels was calculated, and the mRNA
expressions of VEGF and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
were examined. Left ventricular function was similar
between the groups. The numbers of cells positive for antia-smooth muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, and c-kit
were significantly higher in the EPO group than in the
controls (P\0.05). The EPO group exhibited significantly
higher HGF and FGF concentrations (P\0.05) and higher
expression of VEGF and IGF mRNA (P\0.05) compared
with the controls. In conclusion, EPO accelerates angiogenesis
via the upregulation of systemic levels such as
HGF and FGF, and the local expression of VEGF and IGF,
in porcine MI.

Introduction
Erythropoietin (EPO) promotes the proliferation and differentiation
of erythroid precursor cells [1] and is widely
used as a hematopoietic growth factor for the treatment of
anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [2].
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidney in response to
hypoxia, and stimulates erythroid progenitor cells to
increase the number of mature red blood cells [3]. It exerts
its action through its specific receptor (EPO-R), a member
of the cytokine receptor superfamily [4]. Importantly, the
EPO-R is expressed in smooth muscle cells, endothelial
cells, and cardiomyocytes [5], providing a potential role for
EPO in myocardial regulation.
In addition to its hematopoietic effect, EPO has been
shown to confer protective effects in the brain [6], skeletal
muscle [7], and the myocardium [8]. The time-dependent
increase of serum EPO in patients with myocardial
infarction (MI) after coronary intervention has been
reported, and this indicates its possible contribution to
cardioprotective effect in the chronic phase [9]. Cardioprotective
effects of rhEPO in preserving cardiac function
and reducing infarct size have been reported in permanent
occlusion [10–12] and ischemia/reperfusion [8, 13–15] in 
small animal and canine models [16] of MI. The effects of
EPO may prevent acute myocardial death in the acute
phase and prevent postinfarction remodeling in the chronic
phase. Even in the chronic MI model, EPO treatment using

gelatin hydrogel sheets improved left ventricular (LV)
function without inducing polycythemia in a rat [17]. One
proposed cardioprotective mechanism after MI is the
inhibition of apoptosis [8, 10, 18] via Akt [11, 13] and ERK
activation [11], and the phosphaticylinositol-3 kinasedependent
pathway [19]. Another possible mechanism
behind the improved cardiac function in the chronic phase
is enhanced neovascularization [12, 16], a process initiated
through endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization
[16]. More recently, the EPO-induced increase of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression has been
proposed as the mechanism behind the angiogenesis after
ischemic insult via the recruitment of EPCs [20, 21] and
upregulation of the VEGF/VEGF receptor system [21]. The
contribution of other growth factors, such as hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and
insulin-like growth factor (IGF), in EPO-induced angiogenesis
after MI, especially in large animal models, has not
been elucidated. Furthermore, it remains unclear as to how
these cytokines and other growth factors contribute to
angiogenesis after EPO administration in MI models.
In the present study, we investigated whether EPO
administration improves cardiac function after MI without
reperfusion in the chronic phase in a porcine model. We
also examined the involvement of VEGF, HGF, FGF, and
IGF in angiogenesis.
Materials and methods
Porcine MI model and erythropoietin treatment
The current study was performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published
by the US National Institutes of Health. The experimental
protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Showa University. The experiments were
performed using 12 female domestic pigs ranging in age
from 2 to 4 months and weighing an average of about 30 kg.
Each animal received an intramuscular injection of ketamine
(2 mg/kg) and atropine (60 lg/kg), followed by continuous
administration of 2% halothane and oxygen to
maintain general anesthesia. Continuous electrocardiographic
monitoring was maintained throughout the procedure.
To prepare the animals, an introducer was inserted via
the right cervical artery and two or three beads were fed
through the guide wire between the first and second diagonal
branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The animals were randomly classified into an EPO group
and a control group. Each animal in the EPO group (n = 6) 
received four subcutaneous injections of rhEPO (Epoetin b,
6000 U; Chugai, Tokyo, Japan) at 2-day intervals, and each
animal in the control group (n = 6) received the same
volume of saline at the same time points. Left ventriculography
was performed to measure cardiac function during
acute MI and at 28 days after MI. Upon the completion of
follow-up coronary angiography and left ventriculography
at 28 days after MI, the animals were euthanized with an
overdose of pentobarbital and their hearts were harvested.
Blood sampling and cytokine measurements
Blood samples were collected before and at 1, 4, 6, and 28
days after MI. The hemoglobin concentration was measured
in both groups before MI and at 28 days after MI. Serum
levels of creatine kinase (CK) were measured before MI and
at 1, 4, and 6 days after MI. Serum levels of EPO, VEGF,
HGF, and FGF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Evaluation of cardiac function
Left ventriculography and coronary angiography were
performed just after coronary occlusion and at 28 days after
MI. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left
ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured
from tracings of the diastolic and systolic shapes by left
ventriculography. All measurements were taken by three
observers who were blinded to the treatment group.
Histological and immunohistochemical analysis
Some of the samples were collected from each of three
areas in each excised heart (infarcted area, border area, and
remote area), and were frozen in liquid nitrogen for
extraction of mRNA. Others were fixed in a 10% formalin
solution for 24 h and embedded in paraffin for morphometric
analysis. These paraffin-fixed samples were cut out
from a section 1 cm distal from the beads at the occlusion
point of the left anterior descending artery. Sequential
traverse sections of 4–5 lm in thickness were cut out,
affixed to glass slides, and stained by Azan staining.
The histological sections were examined to determine the
wall thickness (thickness of the infarcted area/remote area)
and fibrotic area (infarcted area/LV myocardium area).
Images of the Azan-stained sections were recorded, digitized
, and analyzed by Win ROOF image analysis software
(Mitani, Fukui, Japan) to calculate the wall thickness and
fibrotic area. Five low-power fields were randomly chosen in
each animal to count the wall thickness and fibrotic area (n =
6, each group). The sections were deparaffinized and subjected
to a three-step immunostaining procedure using a
streptavidin–biotin complex with horseradish peroxidase.
Horseradish peroxidase activity was visualized with a
diaminobenzidine substrate, and the sections were faintly
counterstained with hematoxylin. The primary antibodies

were anti-a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) at a 1:300 dilution
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for small arteries and anti-von
Willebrand factor (vWF) at a 1:400 dilution (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for capillaries. Ten
high-power fields (9400) were randomly chosen from
remote, border, and infarcted areas in each animal to count
the numbers of vessels (n = 6, each group). The c-kit-positive
cells were also counted in each area. The primary c-kit
antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
). The analysis was performed by an investigator
blinded to the treatment group.
RT-PCR analysis
Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR
) analyses were performed for VEGF and IGF in the
infarcted, border, and remote areas. Total RNA was
extracted from frozen samples by the modified acid guanidinium
thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method. The RNA
concentration and purity were estimated spectrophotometrically
, and the quality was further assessed using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR
analysis. cDNA was synthesized from RNA by the following
method. Total RNA (1 lg), random hexamer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and the
manufacturer’s recommended buffer were mixed and
incubated at 95C for 2 min, cooled to 37C, and incubated
with Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10
mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmol/l of each dNTP, and 20U
RNAs (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 42C for 50 min.
Previously described methods were used to prepare the
primer sequences for PCR and to perform the PCR itself.
The PCR primers were as follows: VEGF, forward 50-AT
GCGGATCAAACCTCACC-30 and reverse 50-ATCTGGT
TCCCGAAACGCTG-30; IGF-1, forward 50-ACATCTCC
CATCTCTCTGGATTTCCTTTTTGC-30 and reverse 50-C
CCTCTACTTGCGTTCTTCAAATGTACTTCC-30; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forward
50-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-30 and reverse 50-CA
CAATGCCGAAGTGGTCGT-30.
The sizes and quantities of the PCR products were
detected by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer sizes and quantitates 12 samples on a disposable
glass microchip in about 30 min. Each microchip holds
16 wells interconnected via a network of microchannels
filled with a gel–dye mix. Twelve of the 16 wells are used for
experimental samples and 1 is used for a sizing standard
(ladder). The chip was prepared and the samples were loaded
as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, 9 ml of geldye
mix was fed into each of the 16 wells and then forced
into the microchannel network. Two buffer wells were also
filled with 9 ml of the gel–dye mix, and the sample and
ladder wells were filled with 5 ml of marker mix followed by
1 ml of DNA sizing ladder and sample, respectively. The
microchip thus prepared was vortexed and placed into the
bioanalyzer for analysis. All of the experiments were performed
using Agilent biosizing software (Version A.02.12).
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean ± SEM. The means were
compared by the unpaired Student’s t test between the
groups. A probability value of P\0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
Results
Blood data and cytokine measurements
The baseline hemoglobin concentration in the animals was
similar between the controls (9.1 ± 0.2 g/dl) and the EPO
group (9.3 ± 0.7 g/dl, P = not significant (NS)). There was
no significant difference in the percent increase of hemoglobin
between the controls (105.8% ± 8.6%) and the EPO
group (111.1% ± 1.3%, P = NS) at 28 days after MI.
Creatine kinase peaked at 1 day (3571 ± 1292 IU/ml
(control) vs 4368 ± 2158 IU/ml (EPO), P = NS) in both
groups, then returned to the baseline at 4 days. There was
no significant difference between the groups in the serum
EPO concentration at baseline. The EPO concentration was
significantly higher in the EPO group (522.1 ± 348.7 mU/
ml) than in controls (11.6 ± 4.6 mU/ml) at 1 day after MI
(P\ 0.05). Figure 1 shows the time course of changes in
serum levels of VEGF (Fig. 1a), HGF (Fig. 1b), and FGF
(Fig. 1c). Serum VEGF rose significantly in both control
and EPO groups, peaking at 1 day (P \ 0.05) and then
returning to the pre-MI level at 28 days. The serum levels
of FGF and HGF in the EPO group were significantly
higher at day 1 compared with the pre-MI levels (P \
0.05), and significantly higher compared with the levels
measured in the controls (P\ 0.05).
Evaluation of cardiac function
There was no significant difference in cardiac performance
between the controls (LVEF 52.3% ± 2.0%, LVEDV 37.9
± 1.7 ml) and EPO group (LVEF 54.2% ± 2.9%, LVEDV
37.0 ± 3.2 ml) just after coronary occlusion. The LVEF in
the controls tended to be lower at 28 days (47.0 ± 1.0%)
than that at just after coronary occlusion. The LVEF at just
after coronary occlusion was similar to that at 28 days in
the EPO group (54.9 ± 3.8%), and the percent increase of
LVEF in the EPO group (1.0% ± 2.3%) tended to be larger
than that in the controls (-9.5% ± 3.2%) (Fig. 2a). The

LVEDV in the controls tended to be larger at 28 days
(42.5 ± 1.7 ml) than that at just after coronary occlusion.
The LVEDV at just after coronary occlusion was similar to
that at 28 days in the EPO group (38.7 ± 3.1 ml), and the
percent increase of LVEDV in the EPO group (6.6% ±
8.6%) tended to be smaller than that in the controls
(13.5% ± 6.4%) (Fig. 2b).
Histological analysis
The LV wall thickness in the infarcted area of the controls
tended to be thinner than that in the EPO group (41.3% ±
12.4% (control) vs 50.4% ± 19.4% (EPO), P = NS) (Fig.
3a), and the fibrotic area of the control group tended to be
larger (27.8% ± 7.0% (control) vs 25.0% ± 5.2% (EPO),
P = NS) (Fig. 3b). Neither of the differences was statistically
significant.
Immunohistochemical analysis
a-SMA-positive and vWF-positive vessels were counted in
each area. The EPO group had significantly greater

after the administration of EPO in the porcine MI model.

The EPO group exhibited significantly larger numbers of
vessels in the vWF and a-SMA stainings. This meant that
the EPO treatment induced angiogenesis at the small
arterial levels as well as the microcapillary levels. The
beneficial effects of EPO may be associated with the
upregulation of cytokines such as HGF and FGF systemically
, and the upregulation of cytokine production of
VEGF and IGF in the border and infarct areas. Acceleration
of angiogenesis by growth factors is one of the
important mechanisms of EPO used in MI as well as the

inhibition of apoptosis and EPC mobilization. This is the
first report to demonstrate the involvement of HGF, FGF,
and IGF, together with that of VEGF, in angiogenesis after
EPO-treated MI.
Angiogenesis
The administration of EPO before or shortly after the onset
of ischemia enhances the neovascularization of ischemic
areas [12, 16, 18, 20]. Erythropoietin works powerfully as a
mobilizer of bone marrow cells to the peripheral circulation
, and this behavior partially accounts for its proangiogenic
properties [22]. Endothelial progenitor cells in the
peripheral circulation differentiate into mature endothelial
cells, and promote postnatal angiogenesis and vasculogenesis
[23]. Among patients with unstable coronary artery
disease, the percentage of circulating EPCs was significantly
related to the severity of coronary artery disease
[24]. Endothelial progenitor cell mobilization induced by
EPO into the ischemic region after MI promotes myocardial
angiogenesis [16, 20]. Hirata et al. [16] have shown
that EPO administration after coronary ligation increases
circulating CD34? mononuclear cells, which in turn
increases both the capillary density and myocardial blood
flow in the ischemic region. CD34 was unsuitable for the
evaluation of bone marrow cell mobilization in our study,
as it has not been established as a marker for EPC in
porcine models. Thus, we evaluated the cell mobilization
using c-kit immunoreactivity with histological samples
instead.
c-kit is used a marker of bone marrow progenitor cells,
and EPO has been demonstrated to mobilize bone marrow
cells, including c-kit-positive populations [25]. c-kit-Positive
cells are pluripotent cells that differentiate into endothelial
cells and smooth muscle cells. A recent study has
suggested that a robust cardiomyocyte regeneration and
restoration of cardiac function can be attained by directly
implanting c-kit hematopoietic stem cells into infarcted
myocardium or by mobilizing the cells with stem cell
factor [26, 27]. Our group observed a significantly larger
number of c-kit-positive cells in the border and infarcted
areas of the EPO group compared with the corresponding
areas of the controls. This can be taken as firm evidence
that EPO administration augments the mobilization of bone
marrow cells.
The importance of angiogenic growth factor to obtain
therapeutic angiogenesis and prevent myocardial death has
been reported in various models of tissue and cell
implantation, including bone marrow [28, 29]. In patients
with peripheral artery disease, and particularly those with
critical ischemia, their symptoms were improved when
treated with angiogenic gene with acceptable tolerability
[30]. Bone marrow mononuclear cells have been reported
to include many angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF,
HGF, FGF, and IGF. Vascular endothelial growth factor,
basic FGF, and IGF-1 have reportedly been detected in the
supernatant of bone marrow mononuclear cells under both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions [31]. Enhanced mobilization
of bone marrow mononuclear cells by EPO increases
the total amount of angiogenic cytokines and promotes
the development of angiogenesis in the chronic phase of
MI. In addition to the mobilization of EPC into the
ischemic region [16, 20], increased expression of VEGF
with EPO by direct stimulation of endothelial cells [20] has
recently been proposed as a mechanism of angiogenesis.
Serum VEGF levels in the present study were initially
elevated, peaking at 1 day after MI and returning to

baseline by 4 days. These levels were not, however,
affected by the administration of EPO. Yet when we
measured the expressions of VEGF mRNA in the infarcted
and border areas of the EPO group, the levels were significantly
higher at 28 days after MI in comparison with
those of the control group. Westenbrink et al. [20] found
that the plasma levels of VEGF were similar in MI rats and
MI rats treated with EPO, while the myocardial expression
of VEGF was significantly higher in EPO-treated rats than
in the MI rats. The expression of VEGF is strongly correlated
with new capillary growth [20]. The local expression
of VEGF apparently plays a very important role in the
induction of angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium.
Left ventricular function
Several experimental studies have confirmed the effectiveness
of EPO in improving LV function and preventing
LV remodeling after MI [8, 10–15, 16, 19). Few of the
earlier studies have been similar to the actual clinical setting
, as they have used small animal models [8, 10–15].
Our use of a large animal model to closely simulate the
actual clinical setting after MI is a rare approach. The LV
function and infarct size in our EPO-treated pigs were
superior to those of the controls. Yet despite the accelerated
angiogenesis and decreased fibrosis in these animals,
the improvements were not statistically significant.
One of the possible explanations for this discrepancy is
the different doses of EPO used. In several of the studies
with small animal models, cardioprotection was conferred
by administering an EPO dose of 3000–5000 U/kg body
weight by single or multiple injections [8, 10, 11, 13–15].
This dose is considerably higher than the therapeutic range
of 50–300 U/kg used to increase hematocrit for renal
anemia, and it has not been used clinically. The EPO pigs
in our study were administered EPO 800 U/kg (200 U/kg
each, four times) after MI, a dose used in the clinical setting
in humans.
The other explanation is attributable to the use of EPO at
different time points. In experiments with a dog model,
Hirata et al. [16] found that a single administration of EPO,
1000 U/kg just after left anterior descending artery ligation
improved cardiac function at 90 min after MI, probably
because of the infarct size reduction, and subsequently
prevented the development of cardiac dysfunction in the
chronic phase. In the first in vivo study by Calvillo et al.
[8], a dramatic reduction of cardiomyocyte loss and a
normalization of cardiac function were observed after daily
injections of EPO. Yet their animals also exhibited an
increase of hematocrit by 20%–30% by the end of the
study, a change which in itself can improve cardiac function
merely by augmenting the oxygen delivery. Another
group, meanwhile, has reported that repeated low doses of
EPO after MI improve LV function, whereas high EPO
doses reduce LV function and aggravate remodeling [32].
Our group administered EPO, 200 U/kg in four injections
every other day, a dose that leaves hemoglobin concentrations
unchanged in our preliminary data of pig model.
Further studies should be conducted to compare the effects
of EPO at different doses and different time points in MI
models.
Strategy for the future
Recently, we have reported the preliminary data of EPO
administration in patients with acute MI, which is a randomized
controlled pilot trial (EPO/AMI-I study) [33].
Single low-dose intravenous administration of 12 000 IU
recombinant EPO increased LVEF, but saline in the control
group did not increase LVEF, indicating the possibility of
EPO as a promising treatment for patients with acute MI.
The hematopoietic effect of EPO hampers the chronic
administration of the agent at extremely high doses for
tissue protection, as the resulting increase of red blood cells
may cause thrombotic events [34]. Rapid rates of hemoglobin
elevation have been associated with a higher incidence
of cardiovascular events such as vascular access
thrombosis, stroke, and MI [35]. The elevated rate of
thrombosis in patients on EPO therapy has been attributed
to various mechanisms, such as increased blood viscosity
[36] or the enhancement of platelet attachment to the
subendothelium [37] after rhEPO therapy. One promising
strategy to avoid thrombosis is to administer a nonhematopoietic
form of EPO, such as asialoerythropoietin or a
carbamylated EPO derivative. Asialoerythropoietin is a
desialylated EPO, which has nonhematopoietic properties
but retains the extrahematopoietic effects of normal EPO.
It has several unique characteristics, including a shorter
plasma half-life, more rapid clearance from the systemic
circulation, and higher affinity for the EPO receptor in
comparison with EPO [38]. The cardioprotective and
neuroprotective effects of asialoerythropoietin have been
reported to equal or exceed those of EPO [39]. Carbamylated
erythropoietin is one of the EPO analogs, which lacks
erythropoietic activity and does not bind to the dimeric
EPO receptor. Treatment with carbamylated EPO did not
increase the hematocrit, although it did prevent LV function
after MI [40]. Nonhematopoietic EPO may be used in
the future to confer cardioprotective effects after acute MI
without any risk of thrombotic events.
Study limitations
There were some limitations of the present study.
Regarding the methodology used to measure the infarcted
area and cardiac function, the percent fibrous area and
86 Heart Vessels (2012) 27:79–88

percent wall thickness were the only methods used to
evaluate the infarcted area. Our evaluation of cardiac
function was based solely on measurements of the global
EF and LVEDV, as the software for the analysis of the left
ventriculography in humans was incapable of correctly
measuring the regional wall motion in the porcine model.
The quality of the data may be improved by adopting other
methods for the evaluation of infarct size, such as triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride staining and weighing of the infarcted
area, and other methods for evaluating cardiac function,
such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance
imaging.
Conclusion
Recombinant human EPO accelerates angiogenesis via the
upregulation of systemic levels of cytokines such as HGF
and FGF, and the local expression of VEGF and IGF, in
porcine MI.
