Mitochondria dysfunction is implicated in diverse conditions, including metabolic and neurodegenerative
disorders. Mitochondrial dynamics has attracted increasing attention as to its relationship with
mitochondria autophagy, also known as mitophagy, which is critical for degradation of dysfunctional
mitochondria maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial fission and its role in clearance of
injured mitochondria in acute ischemic injury, however, have not been elucidated yet. Here we showed
that hypoxic/ischemic conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and induction of mitophagy in
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rats and oxygeneglucose deprivation (OGD)
PC12 cells. Inhibition of Drp1 by pharmacologic inhibitor or siRNA resulted in accumulation of damaged
mitochondria mainly through selectively blocking mitophagy without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis
and non-selective autophagy. Drp1 inhibitors increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological
deficits in a rat model of pMCAO. We demonstrated that the devastating role of disturbed
mitochondrialfission by inhibiting Drp1 contributed to the damaged mitochondria-mediated injury such
as ROS generation, cyt-c release and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, we proved that under
hypoxic/ischemic stress a Drp1-dependent mitophagy was triggered which was involved in the removal
of damaged mitochondria and cellular survival at the early stage of hypoxic/ischemic injury. Thus, Drp1
related pathway involved in selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is proposed as an efficient
target for treatment of cerebral ischemia.

1. Introduction
Mitochondria are now recognized as a unique and irreplaceable
organelle in eukaryotic cells, which not only act as a plant for energy
production, but also play important roles in cell death and survival,
especially in the condition of hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) injury (Hagberg,
2004; Sas et al., 2007). Mitochondria are the main sources for ROS,
Ca2þand pro-apoptosis factors in cells, and the immediate targets of
intracellular and extracellular insults as well. H/I stress is known to
induce mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes,
mitochondrion fragmentation and dysfunction, which further exaggerate
the injury. Many researchers reported that the damaged
mitochondria accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress, suggesting
that maintaining a pool of healthy mitochondria is crucial for
protecting against injury (Lee et al., 2005, 2006).
The researches in the past years have put the emphasis on
dysfunctional mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway. In stroke,
the therapeutics that have been developed primarily target prodeath
signaling pathways up/down-stream of mitochondrial
damage, such as death-execution effectors and reactive oxygen
species (ROS). However people ignored mitochondria as a whole
are dynamic organelles which constitute a dynamic interconnecting
network. Mitochondrial functions vary with their changes in
morphology (fusion and fission) and abundance (biogenesis and
mitophagy) in a variety of diseases (Zorzano et al., 2009a),

including cardiovascular disease (Lavandero et al., 2011), metabolic
disorders (Yoon et al., 2011; Zorzano et al., 2009b) and neurological
diseases (Chen and Chan, 2009). These facts bring up the possibility
that novel therapeutics may be designed by better understanding
the roles of equilibrium of a healthy mitochondria pool and the
mechanism thereof in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this regard,
efficient and timely clearance of damaged mitochondria is expected
to prevent activation of mitochondria-mediated death pathways,
protect against ROS burst and preserve efficient supply of ATP
(Thomas and Gustafsson, 2013).
Mitochondria can be degraded by non-selective autophagy, as
well as by mitophagy, a selective pattern of autophagy. Nonselective
autophagy and mitophagy have been shown to be triggered
in response to nutrition deprivation, starvation or rapamycin
(Lee et al., 2012; Scherz-Shouval et al., 2007; S€ oren M et al., 2012).
Mitochondria engulfed by autophagosome is observed under

starvation (Lyamzaev et al., 2004; Priault et al., 2005) and
numerous other conditions, particularly when mitochondrial
normal function is compromised (Kim et al., 2007; Rodriguez-
Hernandez et al., 2009). Several studies have shown that mitophagy
plays a major role in the specific recognition and removal of
damaged mitochondria in order to ensure mitochondrial quality
control (Okamoto and Kondo-Okamoto, 2012). Autophagy is also
reported to be involved in OGD cell models (Grishchuk et al., 2011;)
or in cerebral ischemia animal models (Sheng et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2012a, b). However, whether mitochondria are targeted by
autophagy after brain ischemia is unclear yet.
A number of factors that are responsible for mitophagy initiation
have been identified such as Atg32 (Kanki et al., 2009), Uth1p
(Kissova et al., 2004), Atg32 (Kanki et al., 2009) and Aup1p (Tal
et al., 2007). Studies showed that Parkin, a kinase, and PINK1, an
E3-ubiquitin ligase, play key roles in pathologic process of Parkinson's
disease (PD), because recruiting Parkin to the impaired
mitochondria leads to its autophagy in eukaryotic cells (Karbowski
et al., 2007). In reticulocytes, BNIP3L, a Bcl-2-related protein, is
reported to act as a mitochondrial receptor required for mitochondrial
clearance (Novak et al., 2010). Here an open question is
how dysfunctional mitochondria are distinguished from the
healthy ones after H/I injury once the mitophagy has occurred. It
has been hypothesized that there exists a mechanism capable of
separating the dysfunctional mitochondria from the functional
ones for removal of damaged mitochondria after ischemic-hypoxic
injury. The dynamic characteristic of mitochondrial morphology
has been reported to be involved in this process (Bereiter-Hahn and
V€ oth, 1994). Current investigations indicate that mitochondrial
fission/fusion is kept under tight control of conserved dynaminrelated
GTPases (Westermann, 2010). Among these ones,
dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a critical regulator of mitochondrial fission which brings into play after translocating to
mitochondrial outer-membrane from cytoplasm. On the contrary
fusion is controlled by mitofusin-1/2 (Mfn-1/2) (Lackner and
Nunnari, 2008). It has been proved in in vitro studies that during
starvation (Rambold et al., 2011) or normal (Parone et al., 2008)
conditions, mitophagy is blocked when mitochondrial fission is
interrupted. Mitochondrial fission enhancement by hFis1 overexpression
is reported to promote mitophagy (Gomes and
Scorrano, 2008). On the other hand, some studies have produced
conflicting evidences regarding the role of mitochondrial profission
factors in mitophagy. For example, it was reported that
starvation-stimulated mitophagy is uninfluenced in a condition
lacking the mitochondrial pro-fission factors such as Mdv1, Fis1 or
Caf4 (Kanki et al., 2009). Thus, it is until now obscure whether
mitochondrial fission is involved in the clearance of dysfunctional
mitochondria under H/I conditions and other conditions.

H/I injury induced by pMCAO in rats or OGD in vitro leads to
bulk autophagy that is known to remove mitochondria either.
However, it is not known whether in these cases mitochondrial
fission allows induction of mitophagy while non-selective autophagy
is not triggered or changed simultaneously.
In the present study, mitophagy was investigated in a rat model
of pMCAO and PC12 cells exposed to oxygeneglucose deprivation
(OGD). Using immunofluorescence staining and electron microcopy
, we showed that H/I injury leads to the induction of mitophagy
as well as mitochondrial fragmentation. We also provided
evidence by inhibition of Drp1 that mitochondrial fission is
necessary for the induction of mitophagy while without affecting
non-selective autophagy. Drp1 inhibitors were found to exaggerate
neurological deficits and increase the infarct volume in pMCAO by
promoting mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Rat pMCAO model and drug administration
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 260e280 g were purchased from
VITAL RIVER Laboratories, Beijing, China. All animal experiments were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Peking Union Medical
College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and were in accordance with the
principles outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Permanent cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) for 1 (M1), 3 (M3), 6 (M6), 12 (M12) or 24 (M24) hrs. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate intraperitoneally (350 mg/kg, i.p.). The internal
carotid artery (ICA) and pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were carefully isolated. The
right external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated as far away from the bifurcation. To
occlude the ICA, a 0.38 mm nylonfilament (Sunbio Biotech CO., Beijing) was inserted
from the right ECA to the ICA through a small incision and then advanced approximately
18 mm into the Circle of Willis until a faint resistance was felt. Successful
pMCAO (at least 70% reduction of MCAflow compared to baseline) was confirmed by
laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000; Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).
Sham-operated rats underwent the same surgical procedure except for suture
insertion. For the rats treated with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA was
administrated by intracerebral ventricle injection (300 nmol, Sigma) immediately
after the onset of pMCAO. The animals treated with Mdivi1 (Drp1 inhibitor, 1 mg/kg
BW, Sigma) was given Mdivi1 once daily until the end of each experiment with the
first dose administrated before the onset of pMCAO. Stereotaxic coordinates for
injection were bregma posterior 1 mm; lateral ±1.5 mm; and ventral 4.0 mm
from the dura, with the tooth bar set at 0 mm. 3-MA was purchased from Sigma and
was dissolved in normal saline (300 nmol) by heating solution to 60e70 C
immediately before injection. Mdivi1 was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in
DMSO. Control animals received an intracerebral ventricle injection of DMSO (3 ml).
2.2. Evaluation of neurological deficit
Neurological deficit was blindly scored at 12 and 24 h after pMCAO, respectively,
with the method of Ludmila Belayev Scores (Belayev et al., 1996) based on the behaviors
with 0 point representing normal function and 12 points representing the
most severe deficit. The scores were used to estimate posture of forelimb and
comprehensively evaluate the sensory motor ability in response to tactile, visual or
proprioceptive stimulus.
2.3. Infarct volume by TTC staining
2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium-chloride (TTC, Sigma) staining was used for determining
the infarct volumes as previously described (Ravikumar et al., 2006). Brains
were removed instantly and consecutive coronal slices (2 mm) were prepared and
stained with 1.5% TTC in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and thenfixed
in 4% formaldehyde overnight. The infarct volumes (white parts) were calculated by
multiplying the thickness by the area and presented as a percentage of the whole
volume of the cortex with IPP Software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA).
2.4. OGD in PC12 cells and Drp1 silencing
In the sham group, PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5%
FBS and 10% ES (Gibco, USA). In the oxygeneglucose deprivation (OGD) group,
PC12 cells were cultured in glucose-free Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented
with 20 mM Na2S2O4 for 0.5, 1 and 2 h.
The PC12 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA against Drp1 synthesized
by GeneParma using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) before OGD. The
scrambled sequence was used as a negative control. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Germany) and Drp1 siRNA were dissolved separately in Optimem I (Invitrogen).
After standing at room temperature for 10 min, each RNA solution was added with
the Lipofectamine 2000, and mixed for 20 min gently allowing formation of siRNA
liposomes at room temperature. Then the mixture was added to the DMEM (antibiotic-free
) to a final concentration of 60 nmol or 80 nmol RNA separately and 2 ml/
ml lipofectamine. The OGD was performed 48 h after transfection.
2.5. Electron microscopy
Electron microcopy (EM) was performed as previously described (Jasinska et al.,
2006). In brief, SD rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with pre-cooled PBS.
The brains were then removed and the selected MCA areas were cut into small
blocks (1 mm3). The blocks werefixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, washed by
0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), and then processed by post-fixation in 1% osmium tetraoxide for
2 h. After dehydrated by graded alcohols, the blocks were embedded in Epon.

(M12) or 24 (M24) hrs. Data are represented as mean± SEM, n¼ 3. One way ANOVA followed by Turkey test. *p< 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. sham.

Randomly selected ultrathin sections were then poststained with lead citrate and
uranyl acetate, and viewed through a transmission EM (H-7650, HITACHI, Tokyo,
Japan). Images were quantified by counting the percentage of damaged mitochondria
per image or by measuring the mitochondrial diameter per image (n¼ 6).
2.6. Immunofluorescence staining
The brain samples were fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and then
embedded in paraffin. A series of 4mm-slices were prepared. After de-paraffinized in
dimethyl benzene and rehydrated with gradient alcohols, slices were incubated in
sodium citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) and treated with microwave for antigen
retrieval. After naturally cooling, slices were washed in PBST for 3 times and blocked
in normal donkey serum (ImmunoReagents, Inc) for 1 h. Slices were incubated at
4 C overnight with rabbit anti-LC3B polyclonal antibody (1:50; Sigma) or rabbit
anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (1:50; Abcam) or mouse anti-COX4 polyclonal
antibody (1:50; Abcam). After washed with PBST, slices were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with Alexa Flour 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary
antibody or Alexa Flour 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA, USA). Images
were acquired in the MCA territory of ischemic regions with a fluorescence

microscope (Eclipse TE2000e). Quantification was conducted by averaging the unbiased
global Pearson's coefficients (10 microscopic images for each sample) using
ipp software (n¼6). In another experiment, slices were incubated with rabbit anti-
AIF polyclonal antibody (1:100) and then nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342
(1:100, Dojindo Laboratories, Japan).
To visualize mitophagy in PC12 cells, cells were incubated with 100 nmol
Mitotracker Green FM (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and anti-LC3 antibody
(1:100) for 30 min at 37 C, followed by incubation with 594-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200). The secondary antibody was replaced by
fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 10% ES. The fluorescent images of
autophagic vacuoles were counted with a fluorescence microscope.
2.7. Immunoblotting
At the indicated time after pMCAO, rats were transcardially perfused with icecold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the brain tissues of the right ischemic
cortex and the corresponding cortexof sham operated rats were dissected for further
homogenization. To prepare cell lysates, PC12 cells were harvested and rinsed twice
with ice-cold PBS for 2 times and homogenized in lysis buffer. After then, the homogenates
were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4C. The protein concentration
was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (PPLYGEN, China).
The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and then transferred to PVDF membranes
(Millipore, Temecula, CA) for immunoblotting. The membranes were incubated
in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris
buffer saline, TBST) for 2 h in room temperature and followed by an incubation with
primary antibody in TBST overnight at 4 C. Next day, we washed the membranes 3
times in PBST and incubated them with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature.
Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-LC3 (1:1000, Sigma), anti-
Beclin1 (1:1000, Sigma), anti-p62 (1:1000, Sigma), anti-Mfn1 (1:1000, santa cruz),
anti-Drp1 (1:1000, santa cruz), anti-TIM23 (1:1000, santa cruz), anti-TOM20 (1:1000,
BD Biosciences), anti-VDAC1 (1:1000, santa cruz), anti-peroxisome proliferatoractivated
receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a, 1:1000, santa cruz), antimitochondrial
transcription factor A (mtTFA, 1:500, santa cruz), anti-caspase-3
(1:1000, santa cruz), anti-cyt-c (1:1000, santa cruz), anti-ubiquitin (1:1000,
Abcam),anti-COX4 (1:1000, Abcam),anti-caspase-8 (1:1000,Abcam), anti-caspase-9
(1:1000, Abcam) and anti-b-actin (sigma, 1:1000). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
used were goat anti-rat IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, KPL, Gaithersburg
, MD). The level of b-actin or COX4 in the same membrane was simultaneously
assessed as the internal reference. The predicted bands were detected by using
chemicalluminescence(PPLYGEN,China).Thesignalproteinbandswerescannedand
analyzed with Gel-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics).
2.8. Measurement of mitochondrial ROS
Generation of ROS was measured using a membrane-permeable probe 2',7'-
dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma, USA). A total of 40 mg of mitochondrial
proteins were incubated with 200 ml DCFH-DA buffer (20 mM Mops, 250 mM
sucrose, 10 mM Tris, 0.5 mM Mg2þ, 0.1 mM Pi(Kþ), 1.0 mM cyclosporine A, and
10 mM DCFH-DA, pH 7.0, 50mM ethylene glycol bis (2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-
tetraacetic acid). Malate and glutamate were added 1 h later. Fluorescence was
determined at a 488 nm-excitation wavelength and a 525 nm-emission wavelength.
3. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of one way
or two-way ANOVA. Tukey's post hoc test was used for multiple
comparisons. T-test was used for testing between two groups. Differences
were considered significant ifPvalues were less than 0.05.
4. Results
4.1. Mitochondrial autophagy is induced by pMCAO injury
Beclin-1 and LC3B are involved in the formation of autophagolysosomes
, while p62 can constantly be degraded byautophagy. The
pMCAO model used for H/I stress was well known to induce autophagy
(Qietal.,2012).Inourstudy,theresultsshowedthatthelevels
of LC3B and Beclin-1 were increased in the ischemic cortex, peaking
at 3 h and 1 h, respectively (Fig. 1AeC,p<0.01). A reduction in p62
protein levels was observed with a minimum level at 3 h after
pMCAO (Fig.1A, D,p<0.01), which further proved the activation of
non-selective autophagy induced by pMCAO. As previous studies
have showed that damaged mitochondria were removed mainly
through autophagy pathway in other conditions (Wang and
Klionsky, 2011), we were interested in determining mitophagy after
ischemic stress. The amount of mitochondria undergoing autophagy
was measured by using double staining immunofluorescence
techniques. We determinedthe numberof mitochondria(labeled by
COX4) colocalizing with LC3 puncta after 1 h-pMCAO. LC3 puncta
decorating autophagic vesicles are commonly used to monitor
autophagy (Geisler et al., 2010). Only the mitochondria that were
clearly surrounded by LC3B puncta signals were recognized to undergo
mitophagy. The levels of colocalization of LC3 with mitochondriawereenhancedinmodelgroupsbutstronglyreducedby3-

MA. We could see a dramatic increase in the colocalization of COX4
and LC3 puncta in the 1 h-pMCAO group (Fig. 2A, C, P < 0.01).
Treatment with 3-MA significantly decreased the total level of bulk
autophagy (Fig. 2A, B, NS)as well as mitochondrial autophagy in
response to 1 h-pMCAO (Fig. 2A, C).
We further performed EM at different times after pMCAO
(Fig. 3). With EM, the healthy mitochondria had clear and complete
double membrane and crista structures in sham group (Fig. 3A, D).
In the pMCAO group, in contrast, numerous damaged mitochondria
emerged with vague cristae and dense membranous material
(Fig. 3B, C and H, stars) (Kukat et al., 2008). We also observed a
considerable amount of autophagosomes containing mitochondria
and autolysosomes with partially degraded mitochondria after 1 hpMCAO
(Fig. 3E, F, arrows). Taken together, mitophagy was induced
by pMCAO in rats independent on non-selective autophagy.
4.2. pMCAO induces dyshomeostasis of mitochondrial morphology
Interestingly, by 3 h pMCAO, we scarcely saw mitochondrial
autophagy but observed a great number of hyperdense
membranous material (Fig. 3C, H, stars, P<0.01) implying that the
deficit of mitophagy might lead to the accumulation of injured
mitochondria (Fig. 3C, stars). Quantitative evaluation revealed a
significantly greater number of mitochondria of large diameter in
3 h-pMCAO group than in other groups, demonstrating a fission
abnormality of the mitochondria (Fig. 3G, I, arrow head, P<0.001).
Next we examined the expression of fission-related protein Drp1
and fusion-related protein Mfn1. No significant change was detected
in the expression of fusion-related protein Mfn1 after pMCAO
(Fig. 4A, B). In contrast, the expression of fission-related protein
Drp1 in cytoplasm decreased at 1 h after pMCAO, and then steadily
increased with time (Fig. 4C, E, P<0.05). The expression of Drp1 in
mitochondria underwent exactly an opposite alteration, with
transiently increasing at 1 h after pMCAO, and decreasing gradually
with time thereafter (Fig. 4D, F, P < 0.01, P < 0.05), implying that
mitochondria began to fission transiently in response to ischemia,
but the translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria was disrupted subsequently.
The results suggested that the mitochondria autophagy
induced by pMCAO was accompanied by the fragmentation of

mitochondrial morphology were involved in mitochondrial
autophagy.
4.3. Inhibition of Drp1 prevents induction of selective mitophagy
after pMCAO
Mdivi1 is a selective inhibitor of Drp1 (Maria et al., 2012). Our
data suggested that Mdivi1 effectively prevented Drp1 translocation
from cytoplasm to mitochondrion (Fig. 5AeC, P < 0.05).
Ubiquitination of the outer membrane proteins in mitochondria is
considered to selectively cause the degradation of injured mitochondria
(Geisle et al., 2010). We observed a significant decrease in
the colocalization of LC3 puncta with COX4 in the group of ischemia
plus Mdivi1 without affecting general autophagy as indicated by
the conversion of LC3 puncta (Fig. 5DeF, P<0.01). The same results
were observed in colocalization of LC3 puncta with COX4
(Fig. 5GeI). As a consequence, Mdivi1 caused an accumulation of
damaged mitochondria, as shown in Fig. 6BeE ( P < 0.01). The
impairment of fission by Mdivi1 led to the interruption of mitochondrial
autophagy induced by 1 h-pMCAO (Fig. 6AeC).
We next determined whether mitochondrial mass was
increased after inhibiting Drp1. For this, we quantified the
expression of overall mitochondrial proteins (TOM20 and VDAC1
for outer membrane, TIM23 for inner membrane) in different
conditions. The mitochondrial proteins were increased by treatment
of Mdivi1 (Fig. 7A, B, p < 0.05), while PGC-1a and mtTFA
(mitochondrial biogenesis marker) expressions were not changed
(Fig. 7C, D). This result indicates that Mdivi1 led to a significant
increase in mitochondrial mass by blocking mitochondrial autophagy
without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis.
We further tested whether inhibition of mitochondrial fission
blocked mitophagy specifically or disturbed non-selective autophagy
either. We revealed that Mdivi1 did not influence the total
ratio of LC3B/LC3A (Fig. 7E, F), nor the degradation of p62 (Fig. 7G,
H), indicating that the decreased mitochondrial autophagy by
Mdivi1 was not the result of changes in bulk autophagicflux but a
decrease in selective mitophagy. The defects in the recruitment of
Drp1 caused by morphological changes in mitochondria could
selectively inhibit mitochondrial autophagy.
4.4. Inhibition of Drp1 prevents induction of selective mitochondrial
autophagy after OGD in PC12 cells
We further tested whether inhibition of Drp1 could influence
mitochondrial autophagy specifically in PC12 cell cultures exposed
to mild OGD stress conditions that were insufficient to trigger nonselective
autophagy in vitro. The relative accumulation of LC3-II
was most pronounced when cells underwent OGD for 1e2 h as 
compared to control cells (Fig. 8A, P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Moreover,
mild 0.5 h-OGD stress did not appear to affect autophagic flux
(Fig. 8A). Drp1 siRNA significantly reduced Drp1 protein levels in
the PC12 cells (Fig. 8B, P<0.01). The mitochondrial autophagy was
measured by Mitotracker Green FM, a dye that does not depend on
the transmembrane potential and LC3 at 0.5 h of OGD. Strikingly,

although the majority of the cells transfected with Drp1 siRNA had
a normal reticulum of mitochondria, nearly half of the cells in
model group transfected with control siRNAs had fragmented
mitochondria (Fig. 8C), which was in accordance with previous
reports in pMCAO model. The extent of mitophagy was also
significantly decreased in cells transfected with Drp1 siRNAs
compared to the model group in PC12 cells, a shown by the
decreased the colocalization of Mitotracker Green FM and LC3
(Fig. 8C, D, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the level of LC3B was not
changed upon different times of OGD stress between the groups
with the presence and absence of Drp1 (Fig. 8A). Taken together, we
concluded that mitochondrial fission was required for the specific
induction of mitophagy under OGD stress but not for non-selective
autophagy, which further proved that inhibition of Drp1 selectively
impaired mitochondrial autophagy.
4.5. Pharmacological Drp1 inhibition aggravates mitochondriamediated
ischemic brain damage in pMCAO rats
To address the role of autophagy in ischemic injured brain, cerebral
infarction was assessed by TTC staining at 24 h after pMCAO
in various conditions (Fig. 9A). Remarkably, Mdivi1 increased the
mean infarct volume by 30% and 10% compared with model group
and 3-MA group, respectively (Fig. 9B, P < 0.01). Similarly, the
Ludmila Belayev's neurological scores revealed that Mdivi1 significantly
deteriorated neurological function (Fig. 9C, P< 0.05) at 12
and 24 h after pMCAO implying a detrimental effect of Drp1 inhibition
on rats after pMCAO. Interestingly, the infarct volume in
Mdivi1 group was larger than that in the 3-MA group implying that
selective mitochondrial autophagy might be a more promising
target for early treatment of cerebral ischemia (Fig. 9A, B,P<0.05).
In western blotting assays, the pMCAO model group showed a
significant cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation in peri-infarct
region (Fig. 10AeD, P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Mdivi1 treatment led to
an earlier onset of apoptosis (Fig. 10AeD). To test if mitophagy was
generally protective or just under exceptional cases (e.g., pMCAO as
in our experiment), we conducted an additional experiment. The
data of western blots showed that Mdivi1 itself could not exert any
effect on caspase-3 activation and cyt-c release (Fig. 10EeG). To
further investigate the role of Mdivi1 in apoptosis, we examined
the expression of caspase-8 (a marker of death receptor-mediated
apoptosis) and caspase-9 (a marker of mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis) in pMCAO with or without Mdivi1 application. The
data showed that there was a significant increase in caspase-9
expression after Mdivi1 treatment compared to model (Fig. 10J, K,
P < 0.05), but no significant changes in caspase-8 (Fig. 10H, I),
implying that decreased mitochondrial autophagy had an effect on
mitochondria-related apoptosis but not on the death receptormediated
apoptosis. With the aid of immunofluorescence, we
observed that Mdivi1 intervention promoted the translocation of
AIF into the nucleus (Fig. 11AeB, P < 0.01) and increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production (Fig. 11C, P< 0.01). Therefore, we
speculate that pro-survival mitophagy was switched to apoptosis
after Drp1 inhibition. Accumulated damaged mitochondria could
lead to mitochondria-related injury in the pMCAO brain.
5. Discussion
Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked with aging (Wang et al.,
2013) and various CNS diseases such as PD (Ziviani et al., 2010).
The molecular mechanisms for removal of dysfunctional mitochondria
are thought of as crucial. However, the specific mechanism
responsible for mitochondrial selective mitophagy and
dynamics remains elusive. For example, which conditions induce
mitophagy specifically? Are the mechanistic details for mitophagy
identical to that for the bulk autophagy? Can mitophagy occur
independently of non-selective autophagy? Do mitophagy and
non-selective autophagy occur simultaneously or not?

Our study demonstrated that mitophagy specifically occurred
after mild OGD in vitro and at early stage of pMCAO in vivo.
Mitophagy was likely induced and could proceed in a selective
manner without detectable activity in non-selective autophagy
under these conditions. Earlier studies showed the possibility that
mitophagy can be induced without simultaneous induction of bulk
autophagy in yeast. For example, one study reported that in yeast
mitophagy occurred after nitrogen deprivation could be inhibited
selectively by interfering glutathione levels (Deffieu et al., 2009). All
these findings together with ours strongly supported that mitochondria
could be either targeted by non-selective autophagy or
that could be removed in a more sensitive and specific pathway.
The present study showed that rat brain and PC12 cells had a selfrepairing
capability to clear dysfunctional mitochondria specifically
without extensively inducing bulk autophagy at the early stage of
ischemic-hypoxic injury. However, we could not rule out the

possibility that bulk autophagy was also induced, but to a lesser
extent. We speculate that mitochondria are more sensitive to
ischemic-hypoxic stress. A small portion of mitochondria were
impaired after the ischemic onset, it would not stimulate the bulk
autophagic pathway very grossly. Timely and selective removal of
damaged mitochondria may protect neurons from further injury,
which could explain the observed brain recovery after restoring the
blood supply to the ischemic area in a short time (Jendrach et al.,
2008). These observations are also consistent with the facts that
the sooner reperfusion was established, the better recovery was
obtained with minimal ROS risk (Scherz-Shouval and Elazar, 2011).
That is because mitophagy acts as a mechanism to reduce
mitochondria-derived ROS by removing the injured mitochondria.
Apparently, our results were not conflict with the view that prolonged
H/I injury also triggered bulk autophagy. When subjected to
more serious H/I injury, the mitochondrial quality control systems
might be overloaded, resulting in irreversible and permanent
damages (Jendrach et al., 2008). Nevertheless, these findings promoted
a reevaluation of the different roles and mechanisms between
selective mitophagy and non-selective autophagy after
cerebral ischemia.
It has been reported that mitochondrial fission was responsible
for mitophagy under normal conditions (Twig et al., 2008), after
deletion of PINK1 (Dagda et al., 2009) and during starvation
(Rambold et al., 2011). Our results revealed a transiently increased
translocation of Drp1 from cytoplasm to mitochondria. Interestingly
, mitophagy was scarcely observed at 3 h after pMCAO,
accompanied by the emergence of large mitochondria. Other
studies showed that mitochondrion undergoingfission would have
shorter length when compared to mitochondrion that were undergoing
fusion (Chen and Chan, 2005). The morphology of large
mitochondria observed under EM in our study was in accordance
with the morphology observed which were deficient in fission
(Mopert et al., 2009). The inhibition of Drp1 using Mdivi1 or siRNA
showed that mitochondrial fission was required for the induction of
mitophagy under mild H/I injury. Noteworthy, mitochondrial
biogenesis was not affected by mitochondrial fission apparently at
early stage of ischemic-hypoxic injury. These data further
confirmed that the increase of mitochondrial mass after inhibition
of Drp1 was due to defects in mitophagy. Treatment with Mdivi1
also did not affect the autophagy flux for the LC3B/LC3A ratio and
P62 expressions were not changed. Other studies also reported that
mitochondria underwent fission in response to stress (McBride
et al., 2006). These data implied that damaged mitochondria
were initially distinguished from the functional ones by enhanced
fission and then selectively cleared by recruiting the proautophagic
factors. The role of mitochondrial fission in mitophagy
not only depends on the stimulated condition used but also depends
on the organism studied. Some of the studies with
Drosophila reported that mitophagy is affected by interfering in
mitochondrial dynamics (Park et al., 2010). In mammal cells,
studies showed that Parkin and PINK1 contributed to mitochondrial
fission and partially promoted the recovery of mitochondrial
function through Drp1 phosphorylation (Taguchi et al., 2007) or 
ubiquitination (McBride et al., 2006). On the contrary, another
research recently proved that fission is dispensable for mitophagy
induced by rapamycin, a non-selective autophagy activator (Mendl
et al., 2011). Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to
clarify whether fission is required for mitophagy in common, or
only in specific subject or under special circumstances such as H/I
injury.
Cyt-c is found mainly in the mitochondrial intermembrane
space. A great release of cyt-c, AIF and ROS burst occurred due to
mitochondrial dysfunction (Takeshige et al., 1992). Therefore,
elimination of damaged mitochondria would be critical to protect
cells from the release of pro-apoptotic molecules by dysfunctional
mitochondria. In line with this notion, the observation of our study
demonstrated the protective role of Drp1 inhibitors in a rat model
of pMCAO. The results that cyt-c was higher in cytosolic fraction of
animals exposed to Mdivi1 suggested that cyt-c together with its
mitochondria were cleared even before they could be released to
the cytoplasm, and thus may further prevent the damage caused by
activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway initiated via cytc.
In addition, it has been proved that Mdivi1 is efficacious in renal

damage induced by cisplatin in rodent models, suggesting a therapeutic
potential for targeting Drp1 (Brooks et al., 2009). Earlier
studies using Drp1K38A, a dominant negative mutant, confirmed
Drp1 as a promising therapeutic target in neurological disease
(Reddy et al., 2011). Similarly, another protein DJ-1 involved in the
regulation of mitochondrial dynamics was reported to exert neuroprotective
role in ischemic stroke, further confirming the
importance of mitochondrial quality control (Kaneko et al., 2014a,
b; Wang et al., 2012a, b). On the other hand, some articles
showed that enhanced Drp1 activity caused harmful mitochondrial
fragmentation in Huntington's disease and other chronic CNS diseases
(Song et al., 2011). These discrepancies may be because of the
differences in the models adopted or the severity of injury. Typically
, the period and the intensity of treatment or injury determine
what kind of reaction mode the cells choose for adjusting physiological
state to minimize damage.
In conclusion, our research demonstrates that mitophagy can be
induced selectively by mild ischemic-hypoxic injury in a Drp1-
dependent manner. Our data provide further evidence for the
opinion that mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy are a part of
the complicated mechanisms ensuring the mitochondrial functionality
after cerebral ischemia. Selective removal of the damaged
mitochondria is proposed as an efficient target for treatment of
cerebral ischemia.
