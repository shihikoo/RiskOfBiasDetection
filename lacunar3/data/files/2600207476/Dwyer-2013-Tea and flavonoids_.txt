Childhood obesity and adult morbidities1–4
Frank M Biro and Michelle Wien
ABSTRACT
The prevalence and severity of obesity have increased in recent years,
likely the result of complex interactions between genes, dietary intake
, physical activity, and the environment. The expression of genes
favoring the storage of excess calories as fat, which have been selected
for over many millennia and are relatively static, has become
maladaptive in a rapidly changing environment that minimizes opportunities
for energy expenditure and maximizes opportunities for
energy intake. The consequences of childhood and adolescent obesity
include earlier puberty and menarche in girls, type 2 diabetes and
increased incidence of the metabolic syndrome in youth and adults,
and obesity in adulthood. These changes are associated with cardiovascular
disease as well as with several cancers in adults, likely
through insulin resistance and production of inflammatory cytokines.
Although concerns have arisen regarding environmental exposures,
there have been no formal expert recommendations. Currently, the
most important factors underlying the obesity epidemic are the current
opportunities for energy intake coupled with limited energy
expenditure. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;91(suppl):1499S–1505S.
INTRODUCTION
From the perspectives of classification and terminology,
prevalence, and recognized consequences, obesity in childhood
and youth has been in a state of flux. Currently, “overweight” is
defined by a body mass index (BMI)–for-age of85th percentile
but,95th percentile in children and adolescents, and “obesity”
is defined as a BMI-for-age of95th percentile (1).
The prevalence and severity of obesity have been increasing in
children and adolescents, as well as in adults (2–4), and it is
estimated that by 2015.40% of US adults will be obese (4).
The rising prevalence of obesity in this (and other) countries has
been identified as the “obesity epidemic.” Data on the rising
prevalence of obesity in adults, by state, over the past 2 decades
are provided in Figure 1. Adult obesity is linked to comorbidities
that have been attributed to estimates as low as 26,000 (6)
and as high as 365,000 (7) deaths annually in the United States,
with most estimates typically in the range of 100,000–200,000
(8–11). In 2 longitudinal analyses adjusted for smoking status,
annual death risk among nonsmokers increased by 12–40%
among overweight and by 50–150% among those who were
obese (12, 13). In addition, obesity was the second leading cause
of preventable, premature death in the United States after
smoking (7), and in high-income countries smoking, alcohol
consumption, and obesity are the most important causes of
cancer (14). Obesity has been estimated to decrease life expectancy
by as little as 0.8 (6) to as much as 7 y (11, 15).
Multiple studies have shown the association of pediatric and
adolescent obesity with obesity in adults. Overweight children
are more prone to becoming overweight adults, especially at
higher BMIs (16) or if they have an obese parent (17). Almost
half of overweight adults were overweight as children, and twothirds
of children in the highest BMI quartile transitioned into the
highest BMI quartile as young adults (18). Obesity during the
adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences
(14, 19, 20), and dietary habits, physical inactivity, and
rates and degree of obesity become worse with the transition from
the teen years into the young adult years (21). Adolescents with
a higher BMI experienced 30% higher rates of mortality as young
and middle-aged adults, although the persistence of higher BMIs
into adulthood accounted for much of the association (22). In
addition, Must et al (23) showed that being an obese adolescent
was associated with an increased risk of multiple comorbidities in
adulthood even if the obesity did not persist.
This article reviews potential factors contributing to the
obesity epidemic, the effect of childhood and adolescent obesity
on health, and recommendations that health care providers may
consider when working with children, their parents, and their
communities.
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE OBESITY
EPIDEMIC IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS
The increasing prevalence of obesity in children is due to
complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.
The expression of genes favoring the storage of excess calories as
fat—genes that have been selected for over many millennia and
are relatively static—becomes maladaptive in a rapidly changing
environment that minimizes the opportunities for energy expenditure
and maximizes the opportunities for energy intake (24).

hundreds of potential gene loci that affect body weight and
adiposity in humans and the mouse model (25), and many believe
that the heritability of body fatness is best considered a polygenic,
non-Mendelian pattern. However, there are rare syndromes in
children that are associated with obesity that are inherited in
a Mendelian manner, including leptin deficiency, MC4R polymorphisms
, and polymorphisms of the FTO gene (26). A review
of the genetics of mouse obesity models is beyond the scope of
this article, but the reader may find Leibel’s review informative
(27). Both early and late feeding practices of infants may have
a greater effect on later adiposity than previously thought
(28) because premature infants and infants born small-forgestational-age
or large-for-gestational-age are at an increased
risk of obesity and its comorbidities (ie, they may develop comorbidities
at a lower level of body fatness than appropriate for
their gestational age). Being an infant of a mother with diabetes,
even if not large for gestational age, conveys an additional risk (29).
Although increasing attention is being paid to the genetic
contribution to obesity, the vast majority of studies have examined
the effect of environmental and behavioral factors. Recent
changes in nutritional and physical activity patterns are
considered to have produced changes in the fatness of children.
Increased consumption of snacks has contributed disproportionately
to energy intake when comparing dietary patterns 12 y
apart. For example, snacks contributed 18% of total energy
consumed among children aged 6 to 11 y old in 1977, which rose
to 24% in 1996; in a similar fashion, snacks contributed to 21% of
total energy among youth aged 12 to 18 y old in 1977, which rose
to 25% of total energy in 1996 (30). In addition, portion size
accounts for 17–19% of the variability in energy intake (31). One
study noted that nearly one-third of children and adolescents
consumed fast food, and at those encounters they ate a greater
number of calories with a greater caloric density than food from
other sources; the authors estimated that this pattern would lead
to an additional 57 kcal in the daily diet of the average US child
and could account for 6 lb weight gain per child per year (32). A
recent review of efforts to prevent obesity noted that there was
“probable” evidence that consumption of low-energy-dense
foods would help decrease the risk of obesity, whereas the
consumption of sweetened beverages and the frequency or large
portions of energy-dense foods would increase the risk (33). As
suggested earlier, fast-food restaurants have a relative abundance
of energy-dense foods and sweetened beverages. Increased
calcium intake has also been associated with a lower risk of
obesity, but this association may represent an overall healthier
lifestyle and better diet (34).
There is convincing evidence that increased levels and frequency
of physical activity are associated with a decreased risk of
obesity (33). Multiple studies have documented physical inactivity
by youth (35, 36). Associated with decreased levels of
physical activity are increased levels of sedentary activities, such
as television viewing, playing video games, and computer activities.
A comprehensive review reported that most studies noted
a relation between television viewing and adiposity, but that the
effect size was very small (37). However, a longitudinal study
published later that year reported that the attributable fraction
from television viewing.2 h/d was 17% on overweight status
[defined in this study population as a BMI (in kg/m2).25], and
15% on poor fitness, which suggests an important effect on the
population (38). About 60% of children’s television commercials
are food-related, and TV viewing promotes both decreased
energy expenditure and increased energy intake (39). Notably,
greater changes in dietary habits and physical inactivity occur
during the transition between adolescence and adulthood than
during other transition periods (21).
Environmental exposures may affect the risk of obesity. A
recent editorial reviewed the potential effect of both environmental
chemicals and family environment, with potential genetic
interaction, on the health outcomes and the timing of puberty in
girls (40). For example, phthalate urine concentrations were
shown to be associated with central adiposity and insulin resistance
in a cross-sectional study of adult males (41), and
bisphenol Awas shown to inhibit adiponectin release from human
adipocytes (42). There are some examples of environmental
enablers that favor the gain of body fat, and the reader is encouraged
to read the article by Elobeid and Allison (43) for
additional information. Abuse, anxiety, depression, and family
stress may be associated with obesity, potentially through the
adrenal axis and/or stress-related eating patterns (44).
In the United States, as in many other countries, obesity
disproportionately affects those with limited economic resources.
In a recent systematic review of the literature, minority and lower
socioeconomic groups were disproportionately affected by obesity
, but the relation was complex (5). Socioeconomic status is
linked to other factors, which include parental education, number
of parents in the home, parent’s age, race-ethnicity, residential
and geographical location, and availability of safe recreational
areas. Lower socioeconomic status is associated with a reduction
of quality-adjusted life years (11), in part mediated through
behavioral risk factors such as obesity, smoking, sedentary
lifestyle, and alcohol. More specifically, obese 18-y-olds in the
US population can expect to live’47 quality-adjusted life-years
in contrast to 43 quality-adjusted life-years for obese 18-y-olds
living under the poverty threshold (11). However, the risk of
mortality is greater in the lowest income groups, even after
adjustment for those behaviors (45). The disparities in risk of
overweight and obese status among those with limited economic
resources has persisted and even increased; indigent adolescent
males, for example, are more likely to remain overweight, and
indigent adolescent females are more likely to become overweight
, than their peers with greater economic resources (46).
Factors in the built environment may contribute to the relation
between lower socioeconomic status and obesity; these factors
may include walkability of the neighborhood (47) and a greater

number of fast-food restaurants. Individuals who reside in
neighborhoods with a greater density of fast-food restaurants are
associated with less healthy lifestyles and with increased risk of
obesity (48).
EFFECT OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT OBESITY
As noted earlier, obesity during the teen years is associated
with many adverse health consequences (see discussion below),
which include greater rates of mortality as young adults (22).
The adolescent years are a time of change in body composition,
as well as changes in insulin sensitivity and in concentrations of
the adipokines (chemicals produced by the fat cell) such as
leptin and adiponectin. Puberty is associated with increases
in lean body mass as well as fat mass, with a greater increase in
fat mass in girls compared with boys (49). Girls experience
a greater increase in fat mass throughout childhood and puberty
than boys, and heavier girls experience a greater increase in fat
mass during puberty than other girls (50–53). There is a rise in
insulin resistance during puberty (54, 55), as well as a worsening
of various components of the metabolic syndrome, and concurrently
, changes in leptin and adiponectin (56–58). However,
pubertal changes in leptin are sex-dependent, and increased
concentrations of androgens in males can lead to a decrease in
leptin concentrations (59). As previously described, the likelihood
of an obese child becoming an obese adult increases with
the age of the child independently of the duration of time that
the child has been obese (16–18). Childhood obesity is associated
with earlier pubertal maturation in girls, and early maturing
girls tend to have higher BMIs and body fat at the time of
menarche (36, 60–66). However, most girls increase their body
fat as they progress through puberty, and therefore a causal relation
has not been established. A longitudinal study noted that
adult obesity was more strongly associated with childhood
obesity than with the timing of puberty (67), which suggests that
childhood obesity is the underlying factor for both age of onset
of puberty and adult obesity.
Many of the comorbidities associated with obesity are related
to several abnormal anthropometric and metabolic changes that
tend to cluster and are termed the metabolic syndrome (68).
Several definitions have been proposed for the metabolic syndrome
in adults; the 2 most commonly used definitions in
children and adolescents are modified from the adult criteria and
may include the criteria of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
The definitions proposed by Cook et al (69) define metabolic
syndrome as the presence of 3 criteria that include elevated
triglycerides (.110 mg/100 mL), low HDL (,40 mg/100 mL),
abdominal circumference .90th percentile by sex, elevated
fasting glucose (.110 mg/100 mL), and high blood pressure
(.90th percentile). The criteria proposed by de Ferranti et al
(70) uses3 of 5 criteria: high blood pressure (.90th percentile
for age, sex, height), central obesity (waist circumference.75th
percentile for age and sex), low HDL (1.3 mmol/L in girls), high
fasting glucose (.6.1 mmol/L), and hypertriglyceridemia (.1.1
mmol/L). These definitions, although similar, lead to slightly
different outcomes.
Abdominal obesity is the most commonly observed metabolic
syndrome phenotype, the one best correlated with other metabolic
syndrome phenotypes (71) and the most predictive of the
risk of developing the syndrome in children over a 15 y period
(72). Thus, it is likely that abdominal obesity that promotes
insulin resistance is the most central factor underlying the
metabolic syndrome in genetically predisposed individuals due to
the increased flux of free fatty acids, increased gluconeogenesis,
and decreased insulin clearance by the liver. Alternatively, in
a multisite study in adults, insulin resistance as well as fat mass
and distribution were independently associated with metabolic
risk (73). There has been an increase in the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome (74), with increases in hypertension, waist
circumference, and hypertriglyceridemia, which account for
much of the increased prevalence compared with fasting hyperglycemia
and low HDL concentrations (75).
Cook et al (69) noted that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome
using the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) data set was 28.7% among adolescents
with BMIs.95th percentile. This contrasts to a prevalence of
31.2% using the de Ferranti criteria (70) in the same data set.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome appears to be increasing,
with 4.2% prevalence overall in the NHANES III, rising to 6.4%
in the NHANES 1999–2000 data (76), and, most recently to
8.6% (77). Earlier studies noted a similar temporal trend in
obesity, which suggests that longitudinal changes in the variables
associated with metabolic syndrome are due, in part, to the
rising prevalence and severity of obesity (78) and that childhood
overweight and obesity are most strongly associated with adult
clustering of variables associated with the metabolic syndrome
(72). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adolescents increases
with higher BMIs; the odds of metabolic syndrome were
1.55 greater for every half-unit increase in BMIzscore (79). The
prevalence of metabolic syndrome appears to be greater in male
than in female adolescents and in Hispanics and whites when
contrasted to blacks (77).
Several studies note the increased risk of several cancers with
obesity. An increase of BMI by 5 was associated in men with an
increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma [relative risk (RR):
1.52], as well as thyroid (RR: 1.33), colon (RR: 1.24), and renal
(RR: 1.24) cancers, and, in women, of endometrial (RR: 1.59),
gallbladder (RR: 1.59), and esophageal (RR: 1.51) adenocarcinomas
, and renal (RR: 1.34) cancer. There was a reduced risk of
premenopausal breast cancer with obesity but an increased risk of
postmenopausal breast cancer (80). Therefore, the links between
childhood and adolescent obesity and adult diseases, specifically
cancer and cardiovascular diseases, are noted within this article.
A recent review examining the potential links between obesity
and cardiovascular disease included fetal origins, epigenetic
regulation, metabolic programming, and inflammatory changes
whereas other authors have suggested fat patterning, with increased
central adiposity, as a link (81).
The “thrifty gene hypothesis,” as proposed by Hales and Barker
(82), suggests that malnutrition during fetal and early postnatal
life leads to modifications in physiologic functions to improve
early survival. The thrifty gene hypothesis should not be confused
with the “catch-up growth” hypothesis as described by Cianfarani
et al (83) regarding the effects of poor fetal growth on obesity and
comorbidity risk. These physiologic and metabolic changes may
predispose to later disease, consistent with a longitudinal study
that showed that those with coronary artery disease, as well as type
2 diabetes, grew slowly in infancy and fetal life, but increased
their BMI rapidly during childhood (84). Epigenetic regulation
(changes in gene expression through DNA methylation or histone

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/
modification) (85) may affect pre- and postnatal growth patterns
and mediate metabolic programming. These links between obesity
and cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes can be extended
to obesity and cancer. For example, several studies
describe associations between obesity and breast cancer and the
potential contribution of insulin resistance and adipokines (86,
87). There is increasing recognition that fat tissue is a regulator of
inflammation (88) and that enlarged adipocytes promote inflammation
(89). At a molecular level, leptin and proinflammatory
cytokines lead to the induction of aromatase activity, and subsequently
, to the production of estrogen (90, 91) as well as insulin
resistance. Alternatively, adiponectin resistance in transgenic/
knockout mice (genetic models of resistance to insulin’s indirect
effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis) was shown to exacerbate
insulin resistance (92), which implies that adiponectin is a cause
rather than a result of insulin resistance. Adiponectin expression is
down-regulated by greater insulin concentrations, and several
studies have noted an inverse relation between adiponectin
concentrations and breast cancer risk (93–96).
Obesity is associated with lower serum vitamin D concentrations
; however, it is possible that obese individuals simply store
more of this fat-soluble vitamin in a bioinactive form as a result of
their adiposity. Low serum vitamin D concentrations were observed
in 74% of obese adolescents and 32% of controls. In this
study, vitamin D status was influenced by dietary intake of vitamin
D, season, race and ethnicity, and degree of adiposity (97).
Measures of adiposity, such as BMI and waist circumference,
were modestly associated with vitamin D (98). The relation
between obesity and vitamin D appears to be related to both
dietary factors and decreased subcutaneous conversion (99). The
relation between obesity and cancer may also be mediated through
vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is noted as relating to cancer as
well as to other disorders (100, 101). Finally, circulating concentrations
of vitamin D have shown an inverse correlation with
insulin sensitivity, the incidence of type 2 diabetes, body fatness,
and other phenotypes associated with the metabolic syndrome (eg,
dyslipidemia) in adults and adolescents (97, 102, 103).
Two factors related to obesity, dietary intake and physical
activity, may also affect the risk of cancer. In a review of prospective
studies, the only dietary factors strongly associated with
cancer were alcohol consumption, obesity, and weight gain (104).
In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) study, there was a decreased incidence of cancers
among vegetarians when contrasted to meat eaters (105). Several
studies have examined the relation between cancer and physical
activity, with many examining the relation between breast cancer
and physical activity. Lifetime physical activity was associated
with decreased risk of breast cancer; in one study, recreational
activity, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood, was
protective (106). Other studies also documented the relation
between recreational activity and breast cancer (107, 108). One
additional study noted that forms of physical activity such as
household or occupational activities reduced risk, but recreational
activities did not affect the risk of developing breast cancer
(109).
RECOMMENDATIONS
Primary prevention through lifestyle and environmental interventions
has been suggested as the best approach for addressing
cancer worldwide (14), and this approach may serve as the best
advice to address the obesity epidemic and the health consequences
associated with obesity. However, the health care
provider needs to deliver this message in a fashion that does not
encourage disordered eating and eating disorders (110). One
expert group recommends that health care providers should intervene
whenever a child (or adolescent) reaches a BMI above the
85th percentile (111). A comprehensive review noted that promotion
of physical activity and reduced television viewing time
appears to be helpful to prevention. And there is evidence that
school programs while in place may improve physical activity
and improve diet behaviors by promoting increased fruit and
vegetable consumption (33).
The American Academy of Pediatrics has produced a supplement
to address the pediatric and adolescent obesity epidemic,
and the following recommendations are adapted from the
American Academy of Pediatrics (34, 112). Families should limit
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages as well as limit meals
at fast-food restaurants, and families should be encouraged to eat
meals together and to eat breakfast. Children and adolescents
should limit screen time to 2 h daily, and parents should remove
televisions and computers from bedrooms. The American
Academy of Pediatrics, as well as other national organizations,
recommend 60 min of physical activity daily. In addition to these
recommendations, it would be prudent to consider familial
growth patterns and history of comorbidities and other risk
factors. Pediatricians should become concerned with children at
lower levels of body fatness with a strong family history of
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or other metabolic syndrome or
cardiovascular comorbidities or with children who were small
for gestational age due to their higher probability of developing
comorbidities at lower levels of body fatness. In addition, the
association of calcium intake with lower weight may be mediated
through the association of greater calcium intake with overall
better diet (34); there may be a modest effect of fruit and vegetable
consumption on preventing obesity (34).
Although there has been concern regarding environmental
exposures, the scientific justification is not strong enough at this
time, and there have been no formal expert recommendations. If
the consumer is interested in reducing exposures to potential
endocrine disruptors, products are available through several
resources, eg, at http://www.ewg.org/reports/nottoopretty (cited
9 September 2009) and http://www.safecosmetics.org (cited 9
September 2009). An additional approach to minimizing potential
endocrine disruptors is the use of organic foods. Organic
foods are typically more expensive than nonorganic foods, the
purchase of which might be challenging for the budget-minded
consumer. In a case in which a decision had to be made about
which fruit and vegetables should be organic and which ones need
not be, consumer groups such as the Environmental Working
Group recommend buying only organic when purchasing foods
that contain the highest concentrations of pesticides, otherwise
known as “the dirty dozen”: peaches, strawberries, nectarines,
apples, spinach, celery, pears, sweet bell peppers, cherries, potatoes
, lettuce, and imported grapes (cited 9 September 2009 from
http://www.foodnews.org). However, the biggest environmental
exposure that one should be concerned about is the ready
availability of energy-dense foods at a lower cost per calorie than
healthful foods and the ready availability of “competitive foods”
in schools. These competitive foods are sold or served in schools

in cafeterias and vending machines. In a recent study, students
who ate school lunches consumed fewer calories from competitive
foods when contrasted with those who consumed competitive
foods but did not eat a school lunch (113).
CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence and severity of obesity has increased in recent
years and is likely the result of complex interactions among
genes, dietary intake, physical activity, and the environment. The
consequences of childhood and adolescent obesity include
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in youth and in adulthood
and the development of obesity in adulthood. Many of the
metabolic, cardiovascular, and oncologic consequences are likely
mediated through insulin resistance and production of inflammatory
adipokines. The most important factors underlying
the obesity epidemic are the current opportunities of energy
intake coupled with limited energy expenditure.
