Severity of neural injury including stroke in human patients, as well as recovery from injury, can be assessed
through changes in gait patterns of affected individuals. Similar quantification of motor function deficits has
been measured in rodent animal models of such injuries. However, due to differences in fundamental structure
of human and rodent brains, there is a need to develop a large animal model to facilitate treatment development
for neurological conditions. Porcine brain structure is similar to that of humans, and therefore
the pig may make a more clinically relevant animal model. The current study was undertaken to determine
key gait characteristics in normal biomedical miniature pigs and dynamic changes that occur post-neural
injury in a porcine middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke model. Yucatan miniature
pigs were trained to walk through a semi-circular track and were recorded with high speed cameras to detect
changes in key gait parameters. Analysis of normal pigs showed overall symmetry in hindlimb swing
and stance times, forelimb stance time, along with step length, step velocity, and maximum hoof height
on both fore and hindlimbs. A subset of pigs were again recorded at 7, 5 and 3 days prior to MCA occlusion

and spatial variables. Pigs exhibited lower maximum front hoof height on the paretic side, as well as shorter
swing time and longer stance time on the paretic hindlimb. These results support that gait analysis of stroke
injury is a highly sensitive detection method for changes in gait parameters in pig.

1. Introduction
Neurological injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI)
or degenerative diseases including Parkinson's and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) affect millions of patients worldwide from infants to the
elderly [1–5]. Due to the loss of mobility, limb movement and other
motor functions, patients with neurological disorders often need extensive
long term care, experience a significant loss in productivity and an
overall decrease in quality of life [1]. Helping patients gain lost motor
function is a critical component of almost all treatment and rehabilitation
programs with changes in gait often being an important parameter
in measuring longitudinal changes and improvement[2–5]. Quantitative
gait analysis approaches are used to characterize pathologies of

motor control, injury and disease progression and to evaluate treatments.
This approach enables quantitative measurements of
changes in gait velocity, stride length, limb support and other key
gait characteristics that are often affected by neurological disorders.
Gait analysis is regularly performed in clinical settings, however
its use in pre-clinical animal models may potentially serve as
an additional tool to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments
before testing in humans [6–8].Thisisofparticularimportancein
testing the efficacy of drug or cell therapy treatments that must undergo
extensive testing in animal models before being utilized in
patients.
Gait analysis has been performed in rodent animal models of
stroke, ALS, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases with encouraging
results [6–9]. These studies found significant differences in
multiple gait parameters that were similar to deficits observed
in human patients. These studies showed high levels of repeatability
and sensitivity for gait changes [6]. Rodent models of 
neurological conditions have led to significant advances, however
they have proven to be limited in some respects because of
physiological and anatomical differences between rodents and
humans. The human brain is fundamentally different than the rodent
brain being gyrencephalic, possessing significantly higher
levels of white matter and being much larger in size [10,11].
These differences have been highlighted as a significant limitation
in the development of therapies for a number of neurological conditions
and have led to the development of large animal pig
models of stroke, TBI, spinal cord injury (SCI) and Parkinson's disease
to name a just a few [10,12–19].However,quantitativegait
analysis has not been assessed for its potential biomedical application
in the pig, testing for clinically relevant gait parameter
changes that would be pertinent in human neurological disorder
patients.
In this study we utilize a computer based quantitative gait analysis
system to determine gait symmetry and important baseline gait
parameters in Yucatan miniature pigs including swing and stance
time of the limb, velocity, step length, maximum step height and
limb support phases. We then use the developed system to perform
gait analysis on two animals with surgically induced neural injury.
This study demonstrates that significant gait changes in pigs with ischemic
stroke injuries can be detected with a high level of sensitivity
and that this system is a viable option for studying pre-clinical pig
injury and disease models.
2. Materials and methods
All work performed in this study was done in accordance with the
University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines.
2.1. Gait analysis
2.1.1. Gait study
Eight Yucatan pigs were video recorded on three dates within a
10 day period (4 d between recording sessions). Pigs were individually
walked to a separate climate controlled room to conduct gait
data collection. Pigs were walked through a semi-circular track as
described below. Pigs were familiarized and trained to walk through
the chute three times per week for the two weeks prior to data
collection.
2.1.2. Pre and post-stroke data collection
Each of two Yucatan pigs was video recorded on days 7, 5, and 3
prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion as described below. Pigs
were evaluated following experimental stroke surgery again on days
1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 post surgery.
2.1.3. Video recording methods
Two high speed GigEye Ethernet Cameras (IDS Imaging Development
Systems, Obersulm, Germany) set to capture footage (70 frames
per second) of each side of the pig in profile view were synchronized
through an IDS computer driver. Pigs were video recorded as they
walked through a semi-circular chute measuring 4 m in diameter.
Pigs exited the circular chute into a straight chute, 0.6 m in width,
where they were video recorded as they moved perpendicular to
two synchronized cameras recording each side of the pig. The
straight portion of the chute consisted of a 2.4 m prerecording
distance followed by a 2.4 m recording frame, and then a 1.7 m
postrecording distance. Cameras were placed 3 m from the recording
chute on either side of the pig with camera height set at 24 cm.
The chute was constructed of commercial hog panel bolted to the
floor, which tied into a 2.4 m recording frame constructed of the
same hog panel, which was raised 26.5 cm off the ground to allow
visibility of the hooves as the pig walked through the recording
frame. Theflooring was level and smooth with granulation to ensure
a high level of traction.
Pigs were encouraged to walk by a handler walking behind them
through the chute. During preliminary gait data collection, pigs
were not timed as they walked through the chute. For pre- and
post-stroke pig data, pigs were timed using electrical timers
(Farmtek, Wylie, TX) as they walked through the recording frame.
After 10 repetitions, the mean was calculated and any repetition
that fell outside of 10% on either side of the mean was eliminated.
Pigs were recorded until 10 usable repetitions were achieved
(b20 min/pig).
Video data was captured into the program Equinetec (Monroe,
GA, USA). Videos were calibrated using a known calibration video,
and were then analyzed for swing time (frame where hoof first
leaves the ground to frame where hooffirst contacts ground), stance
time (frame where hoof first contact ground tofirst frame where
hoof is off ground), step length (distance that each hoof makes between
sequential footfalls), step velocity, and maximum step height
(peak height achieved by the toe of the hoof through the swing
phase).
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) ischemic stroke injury
Ischemic injury was surgically induced in 2 male Yucatan
miniature pigs by performing a right sided rostrotentorial
craniectomy. A curvilinear skin incision was made between the
ear and eye. This exposed the branches of the superficial temporal
artery and the associated vein. Vessels were occluded using high
frequency bipolar forceps. Following resection of a portion of

overlying zygomatic arch, the temporalis muscle was identified
and elevated dorsally off the parietal bone. A craniectomy window
was generated in the exposed skull bone surface using a pneumatic
drill and burr; the craniectomy was extended into the medial
portion of the orbital bone following resection of the orbital ligament.
The local underlying dura mater was incised, and the
proximal MCA was then permanently occluded utilizing bipolar
electrocautery forceps following its identification distal to the Circle
of Willis. The exposed brain was then covered with a sterile
biograft made of porcine small intestine submucosa; the
temporalis muscle was replaced over the defect prior to routine
closure of the subcutaneous tissues and the skin.

(ADC) maps of the DW images were analyzed using Osirix (R)
software for presence of cerebral infarction.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed with SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC) using Proc GLM
with side of pig and timebeingthevariablesofinterest. A time ∗ sideinteraction
was run to determine significance at each time point. p values
of p b 0.05 were considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. Normal pigs demonstrate gait symmetry
Overall effects for all time points averaged showed no statistical
differences between the right and left limbs of the pig for step length,
step velocity, maximum hoof heights, or stance time for the front and
hindlimbs (Table 1). Differences were observed between the right
and left forelimb swing time with an overall difference of approximately
0.01 s (p b 0.01). When each time point was examined individually
, forelimb maximum hoof height for the eight pigs showed
asymmetries at two of the three time points, measuring less than
0.5 cm difference between the left and right sides (Fig. 1). Hindlimb
maximum hoof height did not show this asymmetry (Fig. 1).
Hindlimb swing and stance times, as well as forelimb stance time,
showed symmetry at all time points recorded (Fig. 1). Forelimb
swing time, however, showed an approximate 0.02 s longer swing
time on the right forelimb at two of the three time points recorded
(Fig. 1). Forelimb step lengths showed alternating asymmetries of
approximately 2 cm at two of the three recorded time points
(Fig. 2), while hindlimb step lengths showed an asymmetry of approximately
2.5 cm at one of the three time points (Fig. 2). Hindlimb
velocities showed close symmetry (Fig. 2), while forelimb velocities
showed a difference of 0.05 m/s at one of the three time points
(Fig. 2). These results indicate that most gait parameters are symmetrical
or close to symmetrical in normal pigs and that gait analysis
is highly sensitive and can detect subtle differences in gait.
3.2. Stroked pigs show significant loss of gait symmetry
Two animals were selected to undergo MCAO stroke surgery. After
24 h post-MCAO surgery, the changes on the DW and ADC images
were consistent with a stroke. Specifically, a territorial area of abnormal

height of forelimb post-stroke with the left leg (paretic limb) achieving lower height while showing no asymmetry pre-stroke (A, B). Hindlimb maximum hoof height Pig 1 was inconsistent
(C) and Pig 2 showed consistently higher hoof height on the right side (D).

hyperintensity was present in the right cerebral hemisphere in the region
of parenchyma supplied by the MCA. On the DWI and ADC maps,
this territorial lesion was hyperintense and hypointense, respectively,
consistent with restricted water diffusion and therefore an infarction
(Fig. 3).
Gait analysis was performed pre-stroke at 7 d, 5 d, and 3 d and
post-stroke at 1 d, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 30 d. Gait analysis showed significant asymmetry in maximum hoof height of the front legs in both
pigs post-stroke with the left leg (contralateral to occlusion of MCA)
achieving a lower height at 1 d, 14 d, and 30 d post-stroke for the
first stroked pig (Pig 1) and at 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 30 d post-stroke
for the second stroked pig (Pig 2), while having shown no asymmetry
pre-stroke (Fig. 4). Hindlimb hoof heights did not show the same
consistent differences with Pig 1 showing inconsistent differences in
hoof height symmetry throughout both pre and post-stroke data collection
and Pig 2 showing a consistently higher right hindlimb hoof
height at all but one time point pre and post-stroke (Fig. 4). Swing
times of forelimbs showed no asymmetries (Fig. 5). However,
swing time of the left hindlimb was shown to be shorter than the
rightattimes3d,7d,and14dpost-strokeforPig1andattimes
1 d, 3 d, 7 d, and 14 d post-stroke for Pig 2 (Fig. 5). Hindlimb stance
time showed similar asymmetries with the left limb showing longer
stance times at 3 d, 7 d, and 14 d post-stroke for Pig 1 and at 3 d and
14 d post-stroke for Pig 2 (Fig. 6). No difference in stance time
between the right and left forelimbs was observed at any time
point (Fig. 6). Additionally, hindlimb step length of the left limb
was found to be shorter as compared to the contralateral limb at
time points 7 d, 14 d, and 30 d post-stroke for Pig 1, but this difference
was only observed at 30 d post-stroke for Pig 2 (Fig. 7). Front
limb step length of the left limb showed a similar tendency in Pig 1
with shorter step lengths at times 1 d and 30 d post-stroke (Fig. 7)
leading to slower step velocities (Fig. 8). However, a slightly longer
front limb step length on the left side was noted for Pig 2 at times
14 d and 30 d post stroke with no accompanying change in stride velocity
(Fig. 8). Hindlimb step velocity showed no asymmetry poststroke
for Pig 1 (Fig. 8), but Pig 2 was significantly faster on the left
hindlimb at times 1 d, 3d, 7 d, and 14 d post-stroke. These data demonstrate
that significant differences in gait characteristics occur after
MCA stroke in the Yucatan pig and that such differences vary between
individuals.
4. Discussion
In this study we demonstrate that gait analysis can be a highly
sensitive approach with a high signal to noise ratio, detecting
small, significant and consistent changes in movement in a pig
MCAO ischemic stroke model. Majorfindings of this study are consistent
asymmetries of a lower front hoof height, reduced hind swing
Fig. 5.Asymmetry in hindlimb swing time in stroked pigs. Swing time of the forelimb in stroked Pigs 1 and 2 was consistently symmetric (A, B). However, hindlimb swing times were
asymmetric at 3 and 4 time points for Pigs 1 and 2 respectively post-stroke (C, D). (** = p-value b 0.01; * = p-value b 0.05).

time and increased hind stance time post stroke on the side contralateral
to MCA occlusion. Human stroke patients have been shown
to display alterations in gait, often times manifested as both a decreased
walking velocity as well as asymmetry of the lower limbs,
and that improvements in these parameters may be used to gauge
recovery from stroke[20,21].Specifically, stroke patients have been
shown to have a greater degree of temporal gait asymmetry as the
severity of stroke increases, with severe stroke patients tending to
exhibit longer swing times and shorter stance times on the paretic
limb (contralateral to stroke) [20]. Pigs in this study displayed the
opposite finding, showing an increased stance time and reduced
swing time on the contralateral hindlimb. However, an important
consideration is that in humans the swing phase of the paretic limb
coincides with the stance phase of the non-paretic limb, and therefore
the forward movement of the paretic limb comes from balance
and propulsion of the non-paretic limb, and vice versa [22].Pigsare
quadrupeds as opposed to bipeds, and therefore their gait must be
examined differently. The two animals examined post-stroke demonstrate
the same main asymmetries of a lower front hoof height
as well as a reduced hind swing time and increased hind stance
time on the side contralateral to MCA occlusion. Argument for the
contralateral side being the side affected by paresis post-stroke can
be derived from the function of each limb. Front limbs exhibit higher
vertical ground reaction forces [23]; therefore, if the left side is affected
by paresis post-stroke and thereby less able to exert force,
this would be manifested as a decrease in maximum hoof height
achieved through the swing phase of the front hoof of the affected
limb. Likewise, the hindlimb may be compensating by decreasing
the swing time and increasing the stance time for multiple reasons.
First, in a lateral sequence walk, as the left hindlimb leaves the
ground, the weight of the left (paretic) side of the pig is now borne
more over the affected forelimb, and thus the swing time of the
hindlimb may be shortened in an effort to hasten ground contact
and help stabilize weight distribution on the affected side. Another
plausible explanation may be that the affected hindlimb does not
exert the same propulsive forces as the unaffected side and thereby
has a reduction in time spent off the ground. Increased stance time
of the affected hindlimb may help to distribute weight of the pig on
the affected side as well as stabilize the mediolateral balance of the
pig.
Previous studies have examined locomotor patterns in pigs as related
toflooring surfaces [24,25] andflooring cleanliness [26] providing
basic stride characteristics (stride length and velocity, swing and stance
time). However, no research has been conducted on miniature pig
Fig. 6.Asymmetry in hindlimb stance time in stroked pigs. Stance time of the forelimb in both stroked Pigs 1 and 2 was consistently symmetric (A, B). However, hindlimb swing times
showed significant (** = p-value b 0.01; * = p-value b 0.05) asymmetries at 3 and 2 time points for Pigs 1 and 2 respectively post-stroke (C, D).

breeds to establish parameters of relevance for future biomedical testing.Thisisthefirst study that describes gait parameter symmetry between
the right and left sides in pigs. This information is critical if gait
analysis is to be used in future studies to establish the pig as a large animal
stroke model to test responses to potential treatments given that
gait symmetry is a commonly affected parameter in stroke patients. Results
of this study indicate that overall, non-stroked pigs have a symmetrical
gait in the parameters of step length and velocity, maximum
hoof height, stance time on both the front and hindlimbs, and swing
time of the hindlimb. Swing and stance time of the hindlimb showed
the most consistent symmetry, with no time points showing differences
between sides of the pig. Hoof height, step length, and stride velocity
showed some asymmetry at individual time points, but differences
were small and of questionable biological significance. Of particular interest
, maximum hoof height of the front limbs showed consistent
changes post-stroke in both pigs, while there were no asymmetries
noted in these pigs at the pre-stroke time points. Non-stroked pigs did
show asymmetries in maximum hoof height, however differences of
symmetry were ≤0.5 cm whereas post-stroke differences were of
much higher magnitude (up to 2.5 cm). These findings suggest that
the pig gait is symmetrical and may be used as an assessment tool in
stroke model testing.
5. Conclusion
Results of this study indicate that Yucatan miniature pigs exhibit
overall gait symmetry in both temporal and spatial parameters that
may be readily analyzed in the pig at walking speeds. Stroke induced
by MCA occlusion resulted in asymmetries in temporal parameters
of the hindlimb as well as maximum front hoof height.
These changes can be compared to asymmetries exhibited by
human stroke patients when results are put in context of quadruped
walking patterns.
