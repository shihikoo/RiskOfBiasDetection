Abstract—High molecular weight (HMW) glycosaminoglycanes
of the extracellular matrix have been implicated in tissue
repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate if small
synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides with different degrees
of sulfation (methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(b-D-glucopyranosyluronic
acid)-O-sulfo-a-D-glucopyranoside, sodium
salt (di0S), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(b-d-glucopyranosyluronic
acid)-6-di-O-sulfo-a-d-glucopyranoside,
disodium salt (di6S) and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-
(b-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-a-D-glucopyranoside
, trisodium salt (di4,6S)) could improve cell survival
in in vitro and in vivo brain ischemia-related models. Rat
hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose
deprivation and a photothrombotic stroke model in mice
were used. The three hyaluran disaccharides, incubated
during the oxygen and glucose deprivation (15 min) and
re-oxygenation periods (120 min), reduced cell death of
hippocampal slices measured as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, being the
most potent di4,6S; in contrast, high molecular hyaluronan
was ineffective. The protective actions of di4,6S against oxygen
and glucose deprivation were related to activation of the
PI3K/Akt survival pathway, reduction of p65 translocation to
thenucleus,inhibitionofinduciblenitricoxideoxidaseinduction
and reactive oxygen species production, and to an
increase in glutathione levels. Administered 1 h post-stroke,
di4,6S reduced cerebral infarct size and improved motor
activity in the beam walk test. In conclusion, di4,6S affords
neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic
neuronal damage. Our results suggest that its neuroprotective
effect could be exerted through its capability to reduce
oxidative stress during ischemia. Its small molecular size
makes it a more potential druggable drug to target the brain
as compared with its HMW parent compound hyaluronan.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is the third leading cause of death, behind
cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and is a leading
cause of serious, long-term disability. Although
treatments for ischemic stroke have been rigorously
investigated for two decades, up to now there is only
one approved pharmacological treatment, the
intravenous thrombolytic recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (Jahan and Vinuela,
2009). Despite the fact that thrombolytic rt-PA has
demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with
thrombotic stroke, the short time window, the risk of
hemorrhage and the requirement for computed
tomography scan before the initiation of treatment
reduces the number of patients (around 4%) actually
receiving the drug; consequently, other approaches to
treat stroke are urgently needed.
The use of neuroprotective agents to preserve
neurons following an acute cerebral ischemic insult has
provided so far disappointing results (Green, 2008).
Despite the testing of over 1000 compounds with
different chemical structures and mechanisms of action,
several of which have proven to be efficacious in animal
models of stroke, none has demonstrated efficacy in

patients in over 100 clinical trials conducted (Green,
2008). This includes, NXY-059 (Shuaib et al., 2007),
which was developed in accordance with the guidelines
proposed by the academic-industry roundtable group
(STAIR II 2001; Kahle and Bix, 2012). In spite of this
rather obscure panorama, there is agreement that the
search of new agents for effective treatment of stroke
patients should continue with even greater effort. A
potential target to develop new neuroprotective
compounds is the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the
perineuronal nets (PNNs).
In the adult brain, ECM is mainly present in the
intercellular spaces between neurons and glial cells.
Whereas most of this matrix is amorphous, there are
specialized structures of dense organized matrix called
PNNs around many neurons with holes at the sites of
synaptic contacts (Hockfield and McKay, 1983; Celio
et al., 1998). PNNs are composed of chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans (CSPGs), such as versican, brevican,
neurocan, aggrecan, phosphocan, hyaluronan, tenascin-
C, tenascin-R and linked proteins (Jaworski et al., 1994;
Asher et al., 1995; Yamaguchi, 2000; Bekku et al.,
2003; Carulli et al., 2006). There is evidence that these
structures are involved in the regulation of neuronal
plasticity (Hockfield et al., 1990; Pizzorusso et al.,
2002), in neuroprotection (Bruckner et al., 1999;
Morawski et al., 2004), and in the support of ion
homeostasis around highly active neurons (Bruckner
et al., 1993; Hartig et al., 1999).
Hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid (HA) is a straight chain
glycosaminoglycan polymer composed of repeating units
of the disaccharide [-D-glucuronic acid-b1–3-N-acetyl-D-
glucosamine-b1–4-]. In contrast to other
glucosaminoglicans found in nature, hyaluronan
disaccharides are not sulfated. Hyaluronan is
synthesized in mammals by at least three synthases
with products of varying chain lengths. At the cellular
level, it is degraded progressively by a series of
enzymatic reactions that generate polymers of
decreasing sizes. Despite their exceedingly simple
primary structure, hyaluronan fragments have an
extraordinarily wide-range and often opposing biological
functions. There are large hyaluronan polymers that are
space-filling, anti-angiogenic, immunosuppressive, and
that impede differentiation, possibly by suppressing
cell–cell interactions, or ligand access to cell surface
receptors. High molecular weight (HMW) hyaluronan
chains, which can reach 2104kDa in size, are
involved in ovulation, embryogenesis, protection of
epithelial layer integrity, wound repair, and regeneration.
On the other hand, low molecular weight (LMW)
fragments are pro-inflammatory, immuno-stimulatory
and angiogenic. They can also compete with larger
hyaluronan polymers for receptors. LMW polymers
appear to function as endogenous ‘‘danger signals’’,
while even smaller fragments can ameliorate these
effects (Stern et al., 2006).
In stroke patients, the production of total hyaluronan
and LMW 3–10 disaccharides of hyaluronan are
increased in post-mortem tissue and in the serum of
patients 1, 3, 7 and 17 days after ischemic stroke, as a
consequence of up-regulation of HA synthases and
hyaluronidases in inflammatory cells from both stroke
and peri-infarcted regions (Al’Qteishat et al., 2006).
Similar results have also been found in rats subjected to
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (Al Qteishat
et al., 2006). However, there is still little and
controversial information about which could be the
actions of hyaluronan disaccharides during brain
ischemia.
In nature, hyaluronan disaccharides are not sulfated,
although in the case of some GAGs like chondroitin it
has been observed that sulfation modulates its activity.
In this study we have used synthetic hyaluronan
disaccharides with different degrees of sulfation (methyl
2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(b-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-
O-sulfo-a-D-glucopyranoside, sodium salt (di0S), methyl
2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(b-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-
6-di-O-sulfo-a-d-glucopyranoside, disodium salt (di6S)
and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(b-D-glucopyranosyluronic
acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-a-D-glucopyranoside,
trisodium salt (di4,6S)) with the idea of exploring their
capacity to improve cell survival in brain ischemia
models. For this purpose we have tested their effects on
rat hippocampal slices subjected to OGD and on an
in vivo model of photothrombotic stroke. Our results
indicate that all disaccharides were able to protect
hippocampal slices from OGD although di4,6S was the
most potent. In this model, the parent unsulfated HMW
GAG, HA, was ineffective. Of interest is the observation
that the neuroprotective action of di4,6S (Fig. 1) was also
exhibited in an in vivo stroke model in mice when
administered 1 h post-photothrombosis. The protective
actions of di4,6S were related to its anti-inflammatory
and antioxidative actions. Therefore, these small
disaccharides with a smaller molecular weight, compared
to hyaluran, could be of potential interest in brain
ischemia conditions.

(Madrid, Spain).
Animals
The experimental procedures were performed following
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and were previously approved by the ethics committee
for the care and use of animals in research of the
Universidad Auto ´ noma de Madrid in accordance with
the European guidelines for the use and care of animals
for research in accordance with the European Union
Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/UE) and with
the Spanish Royal Decree of 1 February 2013 (53/
2013). All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering and to reduce the number of animals used in
the experiments. Rats and mice were housed under
controlled temperature and lighting conditions with food
and water provided ad libitum.
Preparation of rat hippocampal slices and induction
of oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation
(OGD/Reox)
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (275–325 g) from a
colony of our animal quarters were employed. The
protocol was the same as that used by Egea and coworkers
(Egea et al., 2007). Briefly, rats were quickly
decapitated under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia
(60 mg/kg, i.p.), forebrains were rapidly removed from
the skull and placed into ice-cold Krebs-bicarbonate
dissection buffer (pH 7.4), containing (in mM): NaCl 120,

gas mixtures, for at least 45 min before slice

hippocampi were quickly dissected, and slices (350-lmthick
) were rapidly prepared using a McIlwain tissue
chopper, separated in Krebs buffer at 4C, and allowed
to recover from slicing trauma before starting the
experiments for 60 min in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer at
34C (equilibration period). After an initial pre-incubation
period of 30 min, the slices corresponding to the control
group were incubated for 15 min in a Krebs-bicarbonate
solution with the following composition (in mM): NaCl

glucose-free Krebs solution, equilibrated with a 95% N

gas mixture; glucose was replaced by 2-
deoxyglucose. After this OGD period, the slices were
returned back to an oxygenated normal Krebs solution
containing glucose (re-oxygenation period) for 120 min.
Experiments were performed at 37C. Control and OGD
groups were run in parallel in all experiments and three
drug concentrations were tested in each experiment.
When treated, OGD-reoxygenated (OGD/Reox) slices
received the disaccharides or hyaluronic acid during the
30-min pre-incubation period and remained there during
the OGD/Reox period.
Quantification of viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in
hippocampal slices
Hippocampal cell viability was determined through the
ability of the cells to reduce MTT (Denizot and Lang,
1986). Hippocampal slices were collected immediately
after the re-oxygenation period and were incubated with
MTT (0.5 mg/ml) in Krebs-bicarbonate solution for
30 min at 37C. The tetrazolium ring of MTT can be
cleaved by active mitochondrial dehydrogenases in
order to produce a precipitated formazan derivative. The
formazan produced was solubilized by adding 200ll
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), resulting in a colored
compound whose optical density was measured in an
ELISA reader at 540 nm. Fluorescence in basal
conditions was taken as 100 and experimental variables
were normalized with respect to this value.
Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in hippocampal slices
To measure cellular ROS, we have used the molecular
probe 20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(H
2
DCFDA) (Bekku et al., 2003) which diffuses through
the cell membrane and is hydrolyzed by intracellular
esterases to the non-fluorescent form dichlorofluorescein
(DCFH). DCFH reacts with intracellular H
2
O
2
to form
dichlorofluorescin (DCF), a green fluorescent dye.
Immediately after chopper sectioning, 200-lm-thick
hippocampal slices were loaded with 80lM H 
2
DCFDA
for 45 min in Krebs-bicarbonate solution. Subsequently,
slices were washed twice with Krebs-bicarbonate
solution and kept for 15 min before the beginning of the
experiment. Fluorescence was measured in a
fluorescence inverted NIKON eclipse T2000-U
microscope. Wavelengths of excitation and emission
were 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Images were taken
at CA1 at magnifications of 100. Fluorescence analysis
was performed using the Metamorph programme version
7.0. Fluorescence in basal conditions was taken as 1 and
experimental variables were normalized with respect to
this value.
Intracellular measurement of reduced glutathione
(GSH)
To quantify free reduced GSH we used
monochlorobimane, a fluorescent dye that is not
fluorescent by itself until it reacts with GSH to form a
highly fluorescent adduct (Fernandez-Checa and
Kaplowitz, 1990), which is mediated by glutathione S-
transferase (Kamencic et al., 2000). Hippocampal slices
were suspended in 50lL potassium phosphate buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.4) and mechanically disaggregated by
sonication (3–10 s, power 2) in ice. The reaction started
by the addition of monochlorobimane (100lM) and
glutathione S-transferase (0.5 U/ml) in a final volume of
100ll of potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4).
The reaction was monitored in a FLUOstar Optima
microplate reader (BMG technologies, Germany) at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 410 and 485 nm
J. Egea et al./Neuroscience 265 (2014) 313–322 315
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-852588855)
respectively over 1 h at room temperature. All
measurements were done in triplicate in slices from
three different animals. In the absence of glutathione
S-transferase, the rate of adduct formation was very
slow, therefore, the use of glutathione S-transferase
eliminates the interference of free thiol groups present in
other proteins due to its high selectivity for GSH.
Preparation of nuclear and cytosolic extracts
Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as
previously described (Rojo et al., 2006) with slight
modifications. Briefly, hippocampal slices were
mechanically disaggregated in three volumes of cold
buffer A (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.0; 0.15 mmol/L EDTA,
0.015 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40,
1lg/ml leupeptin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride). The homogenates were placed in ice for
10 min. Then, the homogenates were centrifuged at
2300 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant, corresponding to
the cytosolic fraction, was resolved in sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and blotted. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in five
pellet volumes of cold buffer B (10 mmol/L HEPES, pH
8.0; 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mol/L NaCl,
1lg/ml leupeptin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride). After centrifugation in the same conditions
indicated above, the nuclei were resuspended in two
pellet volumes of hypotonic cold buffer A. Nuclear debris
were removed by centrifugation at 2300 rpm for 5 min at
4C. The supernatant corresponding to the nuclear
fraction was resolved in SDS–PAGE and blotted.
Western blot analysis
At the end of the experiments, slices of each group were
lysed in 100ll ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40,
10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
1lg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
20 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM
Na
3
VO
4
). A tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (complete
Mini, Roche) was added for each 10 ml of buffer A.
Proteins (30lg) from these lysates were resolved by
SDS–PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore Corp.). Membranes were incubated with antiiNOS
(1:1000), anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000), anti-Akt
(1:1000), anti-p65 (1:1000) and b-actin (1:10,000).
Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:10,000) were used to detect proteins by enhanced
chemiluminescence. Optical density was quantified using
the program Scion Image Alpha 4.0.3.2. Control
conditions were taken as 1 and experimental variables
were normalized with respect to this value.
Photothrombotic stroke model
Adult male Swiss mice (12–14 weeks old, weighing
35–40 g; Charles River, Barcelona, Spain) were used.
Animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in
oxygen under spontaneous respiration. Mice were then
placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments,
Tujunga, CA, USA) and body temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5C using a servo-controlled rectal
probe heating pad (Cibertec, Madrid, Spain). A midline
scalp incision was made, the skull was exposed with
removal of the periosteum, and both bregma and lambda
points were identified. A cold-light (Zeiss KL 1500 LCD,
Jena, Germany) was centered using a micromanipulator
at 0.2 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma on the
right side using a fiber optic bundle 2 mm in diameter.
According to the Paxinos mouse brain atlas, the primary
motor cortex, secondary motor cortex and primary
somatosensory cortex (hind limb and forelimb) are lying
beneath this stereotaxic position. One milligram (0.1 ml)
of the photosensitive dye Rose Bengal (Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in sterile saline was
injected i.p. and 5 min later the brains were illuminated
through the intact skull for 20 min. After completion of
the surgical procedures, the incision was sutured and
the mice were allowed to recover.
Drug administration protocol
Mice were randomly divided into three groups: (i) subjected
to ischemia and treated with 0.9% NaCl sterile saline
solution (ischemia control group), (ii) treated with 3 mg/kg
di4,6S and (iii) treated with 10 mg/kg di4,6S. Di4,6S, was
dissolved in saline and given i.p. 1 h after induction of
photothrombosis (see protocol on top ofFig. 5).
Measurement of infarct volume
Miceweresacrificedbydecapitation24 haftertheischemic
insult. The brains were quickly removed and coronally
sectioned into 1-mm-thick slices. For delineation of infarct
area, the brain slices were incubated in a 2% solution of
triphenyltetrazolium chloride and then fixed in a buffered
formalin solution; the unstained area was defined as
infarcted tissue. Morphometric determination of cortical
infarct volume was obtained using an unbiased
stereological estimator of volume based on Cavalieri’s
principle (Avendano et al., 1995).
Beam walk test
Motor coordination of mice was evaluated before and 24 h
after the photothrombotic stroke by measuring the
number of contralateral hind paw slips in the beam walk
apparatus (Quinn et al., 2007; Luong et al., 2011). This
test takes place over three consecutive days: 2 days of
training and 1 day of testing. In the beam walk test,
mice have to go through a 520-mm beam with a flat
surface of 10-mm width, resting 50 cm above the table
top on two poles. A black goal box (150 mm
150 mm 150 mm) is placed at the end of the beam
as the end point. The number of hind paw slips were
counted along the beam walk test.
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical
differences were determined with the analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test followed by Bonferroni post hoc
using GraphPad Prism 5.00. Statistical significance was
set at p< 0.05.

RESULTS
Effect of different sulfated disaccharides of
hyaluronan against OGD/Reox in rat hippocampal
slices
Rat hippocampal slices subjected to 15-min oxygen and
glucose deprivation followed by 2-h re-oxygenation
(OGD/Reox) underwent 30–40% reduction of cell viability
measured as MTT reduction. Under these experimental
conditions, slices were incubated with increasing
concentrations of disaccharides (1, 3 and 10lM) 30 min
before, and during the OGD/Reox periods (see protocol
in Fig. 2A). The three disaccharides offered significant
protection against OGD/Reox at all the concentrations
tested (Fig. 2B–D). Maximal protections were achieved
at 10lM for non-sulfated disaccharide di0S (61%), at
3lM for di6S (60%) and at 1lM for di4,6S (77%). N-
acetyl cystein was used as a reference compound; at the
concentration of 10 mM it caused 47% protection.
However, high molecular hyaluronic acid did not provide
significant protection at any of the concentrations tested
(Fig. 2E). Since di4,6S offered the best neuroprotective
profile, it was selected to perform the following in vitro
and in vivo experiments.
Implication of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the
neuroprotective mechanism of di4,6S in rat
hippocampal slices subjected to OGD/Reox
The serine/threonine kinase PI3K/Akt is a key component
in survival signaling pathways (Manning and Cantley,
2007). We have studied its possible participation in the
Fig. 2. Concentration-dependent effect of di0S, di6S, di4,6S and HA on cell viability of rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose
deprivation (OGD) followed by re-oxygenation. (A) Experimental protocol used. After 30 min in control medium, cells were exposed to OGD solution
bubbled with 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
for 15 min and thereafter, slices were exposed to control solution bubbled with 95% O
2
and 5% CO
2
for 2 h
(Reox). At the end of this re-oxygenation period, cell viability was evaluated by MTT (see Experimental procedures for more details). The protective
compounds were incubated during the OGD and re-oxygenation periods. (B–D) Concentration response effects of non-sulfated hyaluronan
disaccharide (di0S), hyaluronan disaccharide sulfated in position 6 (di6S) and 4, 6 (di4,6S) and high molecular hyaluronan (HA) on cell death
caused by OGD-reoxygenation in rat hippocampal slices following the protocol described in A, N-acetylcystein (NAC) at 10 mM was used as a
positive reference compound. Basal condition corresponds to slices not subjected to OGD; this value was considered 100% viability. Data
correspond to the mean and s.e.m. of six experiments. ###p< 0.001 respect to basal condition. ⁄p< 0.05, ⁄⁄p< 0.01 and ⁄⁄⁄p< 0.001 respect to
OGD in the absence of the protective compounds.

neuroprotective effects of di4,6S by using the PI3K/Akt
inhibitor, LY294002. Incubation of hippocampal slices
with LY294002 alone did not modify cell death caused
by OGD/Reox; however, it blocked the protective effect
afforded by di4,6S (Fig 3A). We also evaluated if the
MAPK ERK1/2 pathway could be participating in the
protective effect of di4,6S by using its inhibitor PD98059;
as shown in Fig. 3A, the protective effect of di4,6S
against OGD was not modified by PD98059.
To further analyze the involvement of the PI3K/Akt
signaling cascade in the mechanisms underlying the
neuroprotective effects of di4,6S, in another set of
experiments we measured p-Akt by western blot.
Phosphorylation of Akt results in activation of PI3K which
is linked to neuroprotection, while dephosphorylation of
Akt results in its inactivation. As shown in Fig 3B,
incubation of hippocampal slices for 30 min with 1lM
di4,6S doubled the phosphorylation of Akt. This result
together with the reversion of its protective effect with
LY294002 reinforces the participation of the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway in the protective effect of di4,6S.
Effect of di4,6S on NFjB translocation to the nucleus
induced by OGD/Reox in rat hippocampal slices
Because certain glucosamimoglycanes like chondroitin
sulfate (CS) have demonstrated anti-inflammatory
actions by inhibiting the translocation of p65 to the
nucleus (Canas et al., 2010; Martin-de-Saavedra et al.,
2011) we thought of interest to investigate if this
mechanism was also participating in the protective effect
of di4,6S in the OGD/Reox model. Hippocampal slices
subjected to OGD/Reox underwent an augmentation of
p65 to the nucleus of 1.5-fold. In parallel slices treated
with 1lM di4,6S, such enhanced translocation was
completely abolished (Fig. 4A).
Effect of di4,6S on iNOS induction and production of
free radical oxygen species in hippocampal slices
subjected to OGD/Reox
Nitric oxide released by inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), secondary to an ischemic condition, is known to
contribute to brain damage. Also, the promoter
sequence of iNOS contains a binding site for the
transcription factor NFjB ( Mattson and Meffert, 2006).
We therefore measured iNOS expression in our
experimental conditions. OGD/Reox increased iNOS
expression by over twofold; however, its expression was
significantly reduced in slices treated with 1lM di4,6S
(Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, we measured ROS production in CA1 to
determine if di4,6S could be modifying oxidative stress
caused by OGD/Reox. Under OGD/Reox conditions,
ROS production increased by 2.3-fold; in parallel slices
treated with 1lM di4,6S, ROS production was
significantly reduced to 1.5-fold (Fig. 4C). The PI3K/Akt
antagonist LY294002, impeded the ROS reduction
elicited by di4,6S (data not shown), further supporting
the participation of this pathway in the protective
mechanism of this disaccharide.
Effect of di4,6S on intracellular GSH levels under
OGD/Reox conditions
GSH is the most abundant cellular non- thiol protein,
playing a central role in maintaining cellular redox status
and protecting against oxidative damage (Circu and Aw,
2008). We measured GSH levels in hippocampal slices
subjected to 15-min OGD followed by 2 h
re-oxygenation. As shown in Fig. 4D, cellular GSH
decreased by 36% in hippocampal slices subjected to
OGD/Reox respect to control hippocampal slices.
Interestingly, application of di4,6S at the concentration
of1lM during the OGD/Reox period prevented such
reduction in GSH levels.
Effect of di4,6S in animals subjected to
photothrombotic stroke
Since di4,6S proved an interesting neuroprotective profile
in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD/Reox, we
decided to evaluate its actions in an in vivo brain
ischemia model when administered 1 h post-stroke.
Fig. 3. The neuroprotective effect exerted by di4,6S was dependent
on the PI3K/Akt pathway. (A) Reduction of cell damage induced by
di4,6S (1lM) in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD was prevented
by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY 294002 (10lM) but not by the ERK1/2
inhibitor PD 98059 (20lM). Data correspond to the mean and s.e.m.
of six experiments. ###p< 0.001 respect to basal condition;

Animals in all groups showed no visible neurological or
behavioral damage and none of the animals died.
In control mice treated i.p. with saline, cortical infarct
volume amounted to 19.1 ± 1.7% 24 h after stroke
induction (see protocol in Fig. 5A). Administration of
3 mg/kg of di4,6S i.p., 1 h post-stroke, reduced by 14%
infarct volume, although such reduction was not
significant; however, this dose was able to improve
significantly the motor activity of the animals measured
as the number of slips in the beam-walk test. When the
dose of di4,6S was increased to 10 mg/kg, significant
reductions of infarct volumes (25%), edema (10%) and
number of slips (59%) were achieved (Fig. 5B–D).
DISCUSSION
Central to this investigation is the double finding di4,6S
mitigated on the one hand the neuronal damage
produced by OGD/Reox in rat hippocampal slices and
on the other, the compound significantly reduced the
cortical infarct volume and improved the neurological
deficit elicited by photothrombosis in mice. Secondary
findings suggest that those neuroprotective effects are
associated to anti-oxidative effects of di4,6S as well as
to the activation of the survival signaling pathway PI3K/
Akt.
Serine/threonine kinases such as Akt are key
regulators of neuronal cell death and survival after brain
ischemia (Noshita et al., 2003). Akt can promote cell
survival by different mechanisms; it can phosphorylate
BAD and obviate its inhibitory effects on Bcl-X
L
, and
thereby inhibit cytochrome-c release (White et al.,
2000). Akt can also block the proteolytic activity of
caspase-9 by phosphorylating serine-196, and
translocate to the nucleus to inactivate a pro-apoptotic
member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors
by phosphorylation, and consequently inhibit activation
of the Fas pathway of apoptosis (Berwick et al., 2002).
In the case of di4,6S, although we do not know its exact
molecular target at the cytoplasmic membrane, our
Fig. 4. Di4,6S prevents translocation of NFjB, reduces iNOS induction and ROS production, and restores GSH levels in rat hippocampal slices
subjected to OGD/Reox. (A) The top part of the figure shows immunoblots against p65 in cytosolic and nuclear fractions from hippocampal slices
exposed to basal solution (basal), OGD-reoxygenation (OGD) and OGD-reoxygenation plus 1lM di4,6S (di4,6S). The bottom part shows the
relative p65 levels (density nuclear band/density in cytosolic band) in each of the experimental conditions indicated above. (B) OGD-reoxygenation
doubled the induction of iNOS measured by western blot, and di4,6S reduced its induction. (C) ROS production measured with the fluorescent dye
DCFDA at the end of the experiment increased by almost 2.5-fold the fluorescence in OGD respect to basal slices. Slices treated with di4,6S (1lM)
reduced fluorescence. (D) OGD/Reox reduces GSH levels and di4,6S restored them. The results are normalized with respect to slices not exposed
to OGD/Reox (basal). Data in all figures correspond to the mean and s.e.m. of four experiments. #p< 0.05, ##p< 0.01 compared to basal;

observations indicate that it can activate the PI3K/Akt
pathway (Manning and Cantley, 2007). This assumption
is supported by the observations that di4,6S was able to
increase Akt phosphorylation, implying its activation,
and that the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 counteracted
the ability of di4,6S to mitigate excessive ROS
production (data not shown) and impaired the protective
effects of di4,6S in hippocampal slices stressed with
OGD/Reox (Fig. 3).
Significant amounts of oxygen-free radicals are
generated during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (Chen
et al., 2011). The brain is especially prone to free
radical damage for several reasons: it is very rich in
polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are particularly
vulnerable to free radical-induced peroxidation and it
has a low content of antioxidant enzymes, such as
catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In this context,
di4,6S was able to reduce the induction of iNOS and the
elevation of ROS elicited by OGD/Reox in rat
hippocampal slices (Fig. 4B, C). Additionally, di4,6S
restored GSH levels under OGD/Reox conditions (Fig. 4
D). These results suggest that di4,6S is able to restore
the redox balance under OGD/Reox conditions and
these actions could participate in its neuroprotective
profile. These findings keep pace with others suggesting
that GAGs and some of their LMW derivatives exhibit
antioxidant properties. This is the case, for instance,
for CS that also decreased ROS production elicited
by OGD/Reox in rat hippocampal slices (Martinde-Saavedra
et al., 2011).
Solid evidence supports the view that after an
ischemic episode an inflammatory reaction contributes
to infarct expansion and greater brain injury (Iadecola
and Anrather, 2011). Central stage in this reaction is the
transcription factor NFjB, its gene products, such as
TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, iNOS, and matrix metalloproteinase
9 mediate post-ischemic inflammatory response, blood–
brain barrier disruption, and secondary neuronal injury
(Ridder and Schwaninger, 2009). Compound di4,6S was
able to suppress enhanced p65 translocation to the
nucleus and iNOS induction upon OGD/Reox exposure
of hippocampal slices, denoting NFjB inhibition

(Fig. 4A). By inhibiting NFjB activation, compound di4,6S
could contribute to mitigate the neuroinflammatory
reaction that would explain the mechanism by which this
disaccharide is diminishing the loss of neuronal viability
in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD/Reox, as well
as the reduction of infarct size and brain edema in mice
undergoing cortical-cerebral ischemia (Fig. 5B, C).
In the photothrombotic stroke model, reduction of
infarct volume and edema was only significant at the
dose of 10 mg/kg; however functional outcomes of the
animals were also improved at the lower dose used, i.e.
3 mg/kg. We do not have a clear explanation for this
finding although we could speculate that the compound
could be improving brain perfusion or synaptic
transmission. Further studies would have to be
performed to resolve this issue.
Two additional questions are worth a comment. They
are linked to whether the properties of GAGs are related
to their molecular size and to their degree of sulfation.
Concerning the size, it seems clear that HMW and LMW
GAGs can share some of the properties here described
for di4,6S. For instance, HMW CS also inhibits the
translocation of p65 to the nucleus in astrocytes
stimulated with LPS (Canas et al., 2010) and in rat
hippocampal slices subjected to OGD/Reox (Martin-de-
Saavedra et al., 2011). Other GAGs such as enoxaparin
or O-desulfated heparin have proven efficacy in
reducing the infarct volume size in the middle cerebral
artery occlusion stroke model (Mary et al., 2001; Mocco
et al., 2007). However, not all HMW GAGs afford
neuroprotection; for example in this study, HMW
hyaluronan exhibited no protection in hippocampal slices
exposed to OGD/Reox (Fig 2E). It is also notable that
LMW disaccharides obtained through degradation of
CSPG with chondroitinase ABC, decreased the
secretion of TNF-a, blocked NFjB translocation to the
nucleus, alleviated the clinical symptoms and protected
against neuronal loss in an experimental model of
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Rolls et al., 2004,
2006). It seems, therefore, that the molecular weight is
not determining the antioxidant, the anti-inflammatory
and neuroprotective properties of some GAGs. Also, not
all GAGs do exhibit these properties. The degree of
sulfation may condition the activity and/or potency of
GAGs. Although hyaluronan, that is not sulfated in
nature, had no protective effects (Fig. 2E), the nonsulfated
hyaluronan dimer Di0S did offer neuroprotection
(Fig. 2A), although the di-sulfated disaccharide was
about 10-fold more potent that the un-sulfated
disaccharide. Thus, it seems that sulfation augments the
activity of LMW hyaluronan disaccharides.
A last pharmacokinetic aspect deserves attention. To
target the brain, when administered systemically, a
molecule should have a small MLW and should also
exhibit hydrophobic properties. Di4,6S is small in size
but has three OH groups that may preclude its crossing
through the blood–brain-barrier (BBB). However, it
should be considered that soon after a stroke accident,
the BBB is broken and thus, many molecules can reach
the brain under these circumstances. It is plausible that
the substitution of those OH groups with, for instance,
methoxy groups could enhance the lipophilicity of
di4,6S, thus facilitating its passage through an intact
BBB, yet preserving its pharmacological profile here
described.
CONCLUSION
We report here that LMW di4,6S is a novel synthetic
compound exhibiting neuroprotective properties in
in vitro and in vivo models related to cerebral ischemia.
Such neuroprotection is exerted at low micromolar
concentrations by a mechanism that involves restoring
the altered redox balance that occurs during an
ischemic episode. LMW GAG derivatives may constitute
a promising research area in searching for new
neuroprotective compounds to treat cerebrovascular and
neurodegenerative diseases.
