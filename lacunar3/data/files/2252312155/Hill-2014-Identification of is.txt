Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and treatment options are limited. A promising approach to accelerate the
development of new therapeutics is the use of high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Using a cell-based highthroughput
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model, we evaluated 1,200 small molecules for repurposed application in
stroke therapy. Isoxsuprine hydrochloride was identified as a potent neuroprotective compound in primary neurons
exposed to OGD. Isoxsuprine, a b
2
-adrenergic agonist and NR2B subtype-selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonist, demonstrated no loss of efficacy when administered up to an hour after reoxygenation in an in vitro stroke
model. In an animal model of transient focal ischemia, isoxsuprine significantly reduced infarct volume compared to vehicle
(137618 mm3 versus 279625 mm3, p,0.001). Isoxsuprine, a peripheral vasodilator, was FDA approved for the treatment of
cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease. Our demonstration of the significant and novel
neuroprotective action of isoxsuprine hydrochloride in an in vivo stroke model and its history of human use suggest
that isoxsuprine may be an ideal candidate for further investigation as a potential stroke therapeutic.

Introduction
On average, every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has
a stroke and every 4 minutes someone dies from a stroke [1].
Stroke accounted for 1 of every 19 deaths in 2009 and, when
considered separately from other cardiovascular diseases, ranks
number 4 among all causes of death [1]. Accordingly, there is
much interest in therapeutic intervention to decrease neurological
damage and prevent death after stroke. Despite the prevalence of
stroke, currently, the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of
stroke is the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) [2]. tPA use is severely limited by the need to use
the drug within 4.5 hours after stroke to be effective. Even if used
within the therapeutic window, tPA has a risk of symptomatic
intracerebral hemorrhage [2]. New treatment options are critically
needed to extend the therapeutic window for thrombolysis and
provide neuroprotection to slow cell death after stroke.
Currently, it takes an average of 15 years and $800 million
dollars to bring a new drug to market [3]. Each year, the FDA
approves 20–30 new drugs for human use. At that rate, it will take
approximately 300 years for the number of drugs currently in use
to double. It follows that the repurposing of existing drugs for
novel applications may represent a more fruitful approach to drug
discovery than the discovery of a new drug. The use of highthroughput
screening for the repurposing of characterized agents
with a history of human use is an important part of the National
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences roadmap to enhance
the path from drug to patient [4].
To date, two high-throughput screening studies for novel stroke
drugs have been reported. In one study, organotypic rat brain
slices were used to evaluate the effects of small molecules on
neuronal survival in an OGD stroke model. The study identified
neriifolin, a cardiac glycoside, as a candidate stroke drug in the
OGD model and confirmed in vivo functionality of the molecule
in an animal model of stroke [5]. In another study, a combination
of primary neurons and hippocampal brain slices were used to
screen a chemical library for neuroprotective compounds. The
study identified carbenoxolone as a neuroprotectant and demonstrated
neuroprotection by the compound in an animal stroke
model [6].
Here, we report the identification of isoxsuprine hydrochloride
as a potent neuroprotectant against ischemia via cell-based highthroughput
screening. Isoxsuprine was identified as a top
neuroprotectant among 1,200 compounds in the Prestwick
Chemical Library, which contains diverse, mostly FDA-approved
and off-patent compounds, and its neuroprotective function was
confirmed in transient ischemic injury in animals.

Materials and Methods
Primary cortical neuron culture
Cortical neurons were obtained from Spraque-Dawley rat
embryos at day 18 of gestation. Cortices were triturated and
digested with 0.025% trypsin in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for
10 minutes. Digestion was stopped by the addition of Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Trypsinized cells were filtered using 70 mM
disposable cell filters (Becton-Dickinson), washed twice with
Neurobasal medium (Gibco) containing 4% FBS, and preplated
4 times for 30 minutes in 150 mm vacuum-plasma treated dishes
(Becton-Dickinson). During these preplating steps, primarily nonneuronal
cells adhere to the dish, thereby enriching the neuronal
population. Enriched neurons were plated at a density of 506103/
cm2 in Neurobasal medium containing 4% FBS, 0.5 mM
Glutamax (Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) in white
clear-bottomed 96-well plates (353377) or 24-well plates (353226)
(Becton-Dickinson) coated overnight with 50 mg/ml poly-D-lysine.
At plating, spaces between wells in 96-well plates were filled with
50 ml sterile water to minimize evaporation of medium at the
edges of the dish. Twenty-four hours later (1 day in vitro, 1 DIV),
50% of the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium, 2%
B27 (Gibco), and 4 mM cytosine arabinoside (AraC) (2 mM AraC
final). At 5 DIV, 50% of the medium was replaced with
Neurobasal, 2% B27. At 7 DIV, cortical cultures were 98%
neurons as assessed by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)
antibody labeling and flow cytometry analysis (data not shown).
High-throughput oxygen-glucose deprivation model of
stroke
The Prestwick Chemical Library (Prestwick Chemical) was
screened for neuroprotection in OGD by pretreating 7 DIV
cortical neurons in 120 ml medium in 96-well dishes with 10 mM
compounds for 30 minutes. All liquid handling was automated and
performed by a Beckman Coulter Biomek NX multichannel
pipettor to eliminate potential manual pipetting bias. The
pretreatment medium was transferred to a clean plate for storage
and was kept at 37uC in a 5% CO
2
environment during the OGD
exposure. After pretreatment, cells were washed 3 times with
200 ml deoxygenated glucose-free Hank’s buffered saline solution
(HBSS), pH 7.4, to remove glucose and oxygen and were covered
with 100 ml deoxygenated glucose-free HBSS. HBSS was deoxygenated
in a gas washing bottle with 60 liters of 95% nitrogen, 5%
CO
2
per 250 ml HBSS. HBSS was maintained at 37uC during
deoxygenation in a water bath. Compounds were added to wells
and plates were sealed with sealing tape and placed in a 37uC
incubator for 2 hours (OGD). Eight wells per dish were used as
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated vehicle-only controls. After
2 hours, HBSS was removed and 100 ml pretreatment medium
was returned to the wells. After 24 hours, neuronal death (dead/
live cell protease ratio) was quantified using CytoTox-Glo reagents
(Promega) and a Victor3 V luminometer (Perkin Elmer) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Z-scores were calculated as
previously described [7]. Compounds producing a z-score of at
least 3 were considered hits [7] and underwent secondary
screening.
Secondary screening of primary hits
Neuroprotection by candidate compounds identified in the
primary screen was assayed by measurement of apoptosis using
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) reagents as described previously [8]. At 7 DIV, primary
neurons grown on poly-D-lysine-coated 22 mm-diameter cover
slips in 24-well plates underwent 2 hours of OGD and were
treated with a range of doses of each compound at reoxygenation.
Compounds providing greater than 2-fold protection over vehicle
were then administered at the optimal dose after OGD at intervals
of 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes post-reoxygenation. In vitro
experiments were performed in quadruplicate and results are
shown as means with standard deviation.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
All animal procedures were approved by the University of New
Mexico Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were
in compliance with federal guidelines. Male spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR) weighing 290–300 g were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories. Animals were anesthetized with 2%
isoflurane inhalant during all surgical procedures. The right
common carotid artery (CCA) was ligated approximately 6 mm
caudal to the bifurcation of the external and internal carotid
arteries. With a vascular clamp in place on the CCA immediately
caudal to the bifurcation, a punctate incision was made in the
CCA 5 mm caudal to the clamp and a 4-0 nylon suture (Doccol
Corporation) 30 mm in length with a 2–3 mm silicone coated tip
(0.39 mm diameter) was advanced into the CCA lumen and
secured in place with 2 4-0 silk sutures spaced 3 mm apart and tied
around the CCA caudal to the clamp. The clamp was removed
and the suture advanced into the internal carotid artery until
resistance was felt. In this position, the filament occludes the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) origin and MCA territory becomes
ischemic. The suture was secured with the 2 silk sutures around
the CCA. The wound was closed and the animal was allowed to
recover during the 90-minute occlusion period. After 90 minutes,
the suture was removed and the CCA ligated rostral to the
incision. At reperfusion, animals received 0.5 ml of vehicle (0.6%
DMSO in normal saline) or 1 mg/kg isoxsuprine hydrochloride by
intravenous (IV) injection through the lateral tail vein. All animals
received 3 ml of subcutaneous saline after surgery to prevent
dehydration. After 24 hours reperfusion, animals were sacrificed,
brains were sectioned into 4 mm-thick quadrants, and infarcted
tissue was identified by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining. Edema-corrected infarct volume was calculated by
subtracting the area of non-infarcted tissue in the ipsilateral
hemisphere from the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere.
Infarct volume was quantified using Image J software.
Statistical analyses
Statistically significant differences between in vitro drug
treatment groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Comparison
of infarct volumes between animals receiving vehicle or
isoxsuprine hydrochloride was performed using a two-tailed
unpaired t-test. Differences between experimental groups were
considered statistically significant if p,0.05 with a 95% confidence
interval.
Results
High-throughput screening
We identified 16 compounds with a z-score of 3 or greater. Of
these 16 compounds, 10 compounds have not been previously
reported to have efficacy in animal models of ischemia and
underwent secondary screening (Table 1).
Secondary screening
The neuroprotective function of the 10 compounds identified in
the high-throughput screening OGD model was evaluated using

the TUNEL assay, a direct measure of apoptosis. In the secondary
screen, compounds were administered at reoxygenation in doses
ranging from 0.1 to 100 mM. Compounds providing at least a 2-
fold increase in survival over vehicle included isoxsuprine
hydrochloride, etilifrine hydrochloride, and chlorphenesin carbamate
(Figure 1). The optimal dose for these 3 compounds was
determined by treating neurons with 0.01 to 100 nM compound
for isoxsuprine and etilifrine and 100 to 300 mM compound for
chlorphenesin carbamate at reoxygenation. The doses providing
maximum neuroprotection against OGD-induced apoptosis were
1 nM for isoxsuprine and etilifrine and 200 mM for chlorphenesin
carbamate (Figure 2 A). Of particular interest was determining if
any of these active compounds could mediate neuroprotective
effects when administered after reoxygenation. Using the optimal
dose, compounds were then administered to neurons 0, 15, 30,
and 60 minutes after the onset of reoxygenation after 2 hours of
OGD. Isoxsuprine and chlorphenesin carbamate demonstrated no
loss of neuroprotection when administered up to an hour after
reoxygenation while a significant decrease in neuroprotection by
etilifrine was observed with treatment at 60 minutes (Figure 2 B).

the optimal dose for chlorphenesin carbamate was 200 mM versus
1 nM for isoxsuprine. Thus, an effective dose of chlorphenesin
carbamate may be difficult to attain or exhibit toxicity in vivo. To
evaluate neuroprotection by isoxsuprine in vivo, an exploratory
dose of 1 mg/kg isoxsuprine was administered by IV injection at
reperfusion after a 90-minute occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion onset, total
edema-corrected infarct volume in the right hemisphere was
calculated and compared between vehicle- and isoxsuprine-treated
animals. Total infarct volume in vehicle-treated animals was
279625 mm3 compared to 137618 mm3 in isoxsuprine-treated
animals (Figure 3).
Discussion
The goal of this study was to utilize a cell-based highthroughput
screening model to facilitate the identification of drugs
with a history of human use which may have novel therapeutic
uses in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Utilizing our highthroughput
OGD stroke model, we identified isoxsuprine hydrochloride
as a neuroprotectant and demonstrated efficacy of the
molecule in stroke in animals.
The OGD in vitro ischemia model has been used extensively in
the identification and evaluation of potential stroke therapeutics.
The ease of use and reproducibility of the system, along with a low
cost of implementation, contribute to its being amenable to
preliminary experiments aiming to demonstrate biological activity
of molecules before moving on to more costly and time consuming
experiments in animal stroke models. OGD may be performed in
organotypic brain slices, where the 3-dimensional arrangement of
neurons, glial cells, and extracellular matrix is partially preserved,
or in neuronal cultures which may consist of purified neurons, as
in this study, or mixed populations of neurons, glial cells, and
endothelial cells. While organotypic slices may most closely
represent intact brain tissue, the method is labor- and timeintensive
and expensive since numerous animals are required to
manually prepare sufficient tissue sections needed to screen a
chemical library which may contain thousands of compounds.
Further, since multiple cell types are present, the establishment of

versus time 0 (*, p,0.01).

neuron-specific cell death measures can be complex and complicates
high-throughput screening efforts which typically benefit
from rapid, easily implemented measures of cell survival.
In vivo, activation of glial cells and infiltration of immune cells
at infarct sites during ischemia/reperfusion is believed to facilitate
neuronal death. To approximate this situation, neurons may be
co-cultured with astrocytes or microglia and subjected to OGD. In
this mixed culture model, compounds that are neuroprotective
may exert their effects through glial cells or directly on neurons.
This latter possibility may be verified by comparing neuroprotection
by a compound during OGD in mixed cultures and in pure
neurons. To examine direct neuroprotection by a compound, a
pure neuronal population may be used. Use of an enriched
neuronal population eliminates possible confounding effects
introduced by the presence of glial cells, such as astrocytes and
microglia, which are typically activated ex vivo and may influence
neuronal survival and responses to stressors in ways not reflective
of an in vivo ischemia/reperfusion scenario. Additionally, the
primary neurons obtained from the embryonic pups of a single
animal can be sufficient to screen an entire chemical library.
Further, since only one cell type is present in enriched neurons,
any cell death observed can be specifically attributed to neurons
without performing additional experiments. These latter advantages
particularly favor the use of pure neuronal populations in
streamlined preliminary high-throughput screening studies.
Our cell-based model was validated by the identification of
MK-801 as the top hit in a high-throughput screen, along with 5
other compounds with previously reported efficacy in ischemic
models. MK-801 is a potent neuroprotectant and the highest
affinity NMDA receptor antagonist known. Although highly
protective in animal and in vitro ischemia models, MK-801 has
a limited therapeutic window and causes severe neurological side
effects, including psychosis. Pretreatment with compounds was
used to validate our assay and increase sensitivity in the highthroughput
primary screen. As our results show, the number 2 hit,
mianserine hydrochloride, was highly protective when used as a
pretreatment but ineffective when given at reoxygenation in the
secondary screen. Similar results were reported with MK-801,
which was neuroprotective during OGD when used as a
pretreatment but significantly decreased in effectiveness when
administered as few as 5 minutes after the onset of reoxygenation
[5]. Thus, while pretreatment with compounds is reasonable
during high-throughput screening, a secondary screen with
compounds given at or after reoxygenation in vitro or reperfusion
in vivo should be employed as pretreatment scenarios may not be
clinically relevant to the treatment of acute stroke. Additionally, as
the measures of neuronal survival employed may significantly
influence screening outcome, a secondary assay and direct
measure of neuronal apoptosis such as TUNEL should be used
to confirm neuroprotection observed in high-throughput assays.
Our identification of isoxsuprine hydrochloride, a well-characterized b
2
-adrenergic agonist and peripheral vasodilator, as a
potent neuroprotectant in vitro and confirmation of its action in an
animal stroke model both further validate the high-throughput
screening assay and suggest a significant effect of adrenergic
receptor activation in promoting neuronal survival in ischemic
stroke. This latter possibility is supported by several studies
demonstrating neuroprotection by b-agonists in animal and in
vitro models of ischemia [9–11]. Clenbuterol, ab
2
-adrenoreceptor
agonist, is protective during OGD in mixed neuronal cultures and
in animal stroke models. Clenbuterol is believed to exert
neuroprotection by activating astrocytes and stimulating the
production of nerve growth factors (NGFs) which promote
neuronal survival [10]. Interestingly, clenbuterol is present in the
Prestwick Chemical Library but was not identified as a neuroprotective
compound in our high-throughput screening assay utilizing
pure cortical neurons (z-score of 0). This is consistent with the
reported effects of clenbuterol on astrocyte-mediated NGF
production. Thus, whether the ‘‘hits’’ emerging from a cell-based
high-throughput screen target neurons, glial cells, or both may
depend highly upon the in vitro OGD model utilized. While there
is clear and significant involvement of adrenergic receptor
activation in neuronal survival decisions in ischemic injury, the
underlying mechanisms remain to be further characterized.
In an animal stroke model, co-administration of clenbuterol and
memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, was shown to be more
effective than administration of either compound individually,
extended the therapeutic window for clenbuterol treatment, and
has been proposed to be a potential clinical approach to stroke
therapy [12]. Ifenprodil, an NR2B subtype-selective NMDA
receptor antagonist and known neuroprotectant in stroke models
[13], was neuroprotective in our primary screen but was just below

the cutoff for being considered a hit (z-score of 2.916). The
remarkable neuroprotection provided by isoxsuprine hydrochloride
in the MCAO model may be related to the fact that
isoxsuprine possess both b
2
-adrenoreceptor agonist [14] and
NR2B subtype-selective NMDA receptor antagonist [15] functions
in a single molecule. Isoxsuprine also possesses significant a
1
-
adrenoreceptor antagonist activity [16,17] which may further
promote neuroprotection by enhancing b
2
-agonism-mediated
cerebral vasodilation and inhibiting vasoconstriction in ischemic
injury. Thus, isoxsuprine may synergistically exploit at least two
known neuroprotective pathways while simultaneously increasing
circulation to the fragile penumbral region after ischemia and
preventing evolution of the infarct core.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate the identification of a potential stroke
therapeutic through cell-based high-throughput screening of a
chemical library. Isoxsuprine is of particular interest as a stroke
therapeutic because of its extensive history of use in humans for
the treatment of numerous indications, including cerebrovascular
insufficiency, hypertension, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and suppression
of premature labor [18–21]. Our finding of the potent
neuroprotective effects of isoxsuprine hydrochloride in ischemic
stroke warrants further investigation.
