To explore whether human albumin (Alb) administration prior to thrombolysis with
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) can eliminate brain damage induced by
this treatment given after the effective and safe window of 3 h after stroke onset. Rats
were subjected to embolic stroke by unilateral embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Three or six hours after the onset of stroke, rats were administered
intravenously with saline (control), rt-PA (thrombolysis) or rt-PA+Alb (additional Alb 3 h
after MCAO, combination). Cerebral blood flow, infarct volume, space-occupying effect
and blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) were
assessed dynamically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 h, 7 and 14 days after
treatment. BBB leakage of both fluoro-isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) and erythrocytes
was also evaluated 14 days after treatment. The space-occupying effect in the combination
group at 7 days after treatment declined significantly compared with that at 24 h
after treatment (P<0.05), but additional Alb treatment failed to reduce the infarct volumes
or improve cerebral blood volume. Furthermore, BBB leakage of both small (Gd-DTPA) and
large (FITC-dextran and erythrocytes) molecules decreased significantly in the combination compared
to the saline or thrombolysis groups (P<0.05). Alb administration prior to thrombolysis (3 h
after stroke) can reduce delayed rt-PA treatment-induced brain edema and BBB permeability.

1. Introduction
Early thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (rt-PA) within 3 h of onset of ischemic
stroke leads to improvement of clinical outcomes. In actual
clinical practice, only a small proportion of patients with
acute ischemic stroke receive rt-PA treatment, because they
cannot reach the hospital in time to benefit from safe thrombolysis.
Delayed treatment with rt-PA alone has been shown
to exacerbate brain injury and neurological deficits, and to
lead to increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation
(Dijkhuizen et al., 2001, 2002). Therefore, experimental studies
with different emerging strategies aiming at extending the
therapeutic window for thrombolysis have been reported,
and these studies targeted platelet aggregation, cyclindependent-kinase
, hemorrhagic transformation, inflammation
effects, and the extravascular neurotoxic effect of rt-PA
(Adams et al., 2008; Copin et al., 2008; Molina and Saver,

2005; Zhang et al., 2004, 2007). Special attention has been paid
to albumin (Alb) since moderate- to high-dose Alb therapy has
shown to be highly neuroprotective in animal models of both
cerebral ischemia and hematoma (Belayev et al., 1997, 2001,
2005). In focal ischemia, Alb given intravenously (i.v. dose
1.25 g/kg) diminished total infarct volume by two-thirds and
reduced brain edema by three-quarters or more, with a therapeutic
window of full efficacy extending to 4 h (Belayev et al.,
2001). Additionally, the use of the standard-of-care intravenous
t-PA combination with Alb suggested positive synergistic
effect (Palesch et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2009). To date,
delayed rt-PA treatment (more than 3 h after onset of stroke)
combination with Alb has not been reported.
Alb, as a promising neuroprotectant, can markedly improve
neurological function, reduce brain swelling and blood
brain barrier permeability (Belayev et al., 1997, 2001, 2005;
Tang et al., 2009). We hypothesized that prompt Alb therapy
(within 3 h after stroke) could reduce brain edema or eliminate
late rt-PA treatment-induced damage. Therefore, we investigated
the development of brain edema, microvascular
permeability as well as incidence of hemorrhage in rats with
delayed rt-PA treatment with or without Alb and explored
whether Alb administration prior to rt-PA could eliminate
delayed rt-PA treatment-induced brain damage.
2. Results
Rats that died during the procedure because of massive bleeding
from surgical wound or respiratory arrest (n=4) were excluded
and replaced. Rats with no neurological deficit (n=5),
or no lesion on T2WI 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) (n=4) or with additional lesion in the contralateral
hemisphere (n=3) were also excluded and replaced.
Neurological deficits were observed in the other rats 2 h after
MCAO. Before treatment, the neurological scores were 9±0,
9±0, 8.7±0.3 for the thrombolysis, combination and saline
groups, respectively, and no difference was found between
these groups. Sham-operated animals (n=5) showed no evidence
of lesions (neurological score=0).
2.1. Infarct volume and space-occupying effect
Brain infarctions were located both in the left parietal cortex
and striatum (Fig. 1), and statistical analysis indicated that
the hemispheric ischemic lesion volume (%HLVe) was significantly
smaller at 7 and 14 days after treatment compared
with 1 day after treatment (P<0.01). The combination of rt-PA
with Alb failed to reduce the %HLVe compared with that in
the saline-/rt-PA treated groups (P>0.05). In the therapeutic
window study, treatment with the rt-PA/Alb combination
with Alb exhibited a reduction of %HLVe by a mean of 13%
when treatment was initiated at 3 h and by 6% at 6 h, but no
significant difference was found between them (P>0.05)
(Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the %HLVe of the rats that died within
24 h after treatment (because of larger ipsilateral hemispheric
infarct volume and brain edema, 4 rats in the saline group, 4
rats in the thrombolysis group and 5 rats in the combination
group, Table 1) were significantly larger than those which survived
the procedure (mean % HLVe was 41.2% in dead rats
and 19.1%, 20.9% and 19.3%, respectively, in the saline group,
thrombolysis and combination groups) (P<0.01).
However, the space-occupying effect (%SOE) in the combination
group at 7 days after treatment declined compared
with that at 24 h after treatment (P<0.05), although the
space-occupying effect declined more remarkably when treatment
was performed 3 h after onset of MCAO, and no significant
difference was found among the subgroups when
treatment was initiated at different time points (by a mean
of 1.7% when initiated at 3 h; by 3.1% at 6 h, P>0.05). In addition
, 14 days after treatment, the residual space-occupying effect
was found in the saline and thrombolysis groups, while a
negative space-occupying effect was found in the combination
groups. On the other hand, the %SOE in saline group or
thrombolysis group declined over time with no significant difference
at different time points (P>0.05). (Fig. 3).
2.2. Cerebral blood volume
Twenty four hours after thrombolysis with or without Alb, the
cerebral blood volume both in the striatum and cortex was
slightly higher than that treated with saline, with no significant
difference among different groups (P>0.05). Seven days
and 14 days later, the cerebral blood volumes in both striatum
and cortex were not significantly different than at 1 day after
treatment (Table 2). These results indicated that delayed
treatment did not result in an improvement of cerebral
blood volume improvement even when combined with Alb.
2.3. BBB leakage based on Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI
Gd-DTPA-enhancement on post-contrast T1WI was within
the ischemic region, BBB leakage for Gd-DTPA lasted 14 days
after MCAO in the saline group, and the enhancement became
heavier when rats treated with rt-PA were compared to those
treated with saline, but no significant difference was found
between them (P>0.05). However, the enhancement decreased
significantly in the combination group compared to
that in the saline or thrombolysis group even when treatment
was initiated at 6 h after MCAO (P<0.05), although the
Gd-DTPA-enhancement decreased remarkably in rats when
treatment was initiated at 3 h after MCAO. No significant difference
was found between treatments which were initiated
at 3 and 6 h post MCAO (P>0.05). In addition, the enhancement
decreased remarkably over time in the combination
group, but no significant difference was found between different
time points (P=0.054) (Figs. 1, 4). The sham animals did not
show any Gd-DTPA-mediated enhancement.
2.4. BBB leakage based on FITC-dextran extravasation
The microvessels of the ischemic area in both cortex and striatum
in the saline group were partially perfused with FITC-
dextran, with FITC-dextran leakage in the ischemic areas,
but no remarkable change was found when treatment was initiated
at 3 or 6 h after MCAO. By contrast, the microvessels
were well perfused by FITC-dextran in ischemic areas in the
thrombolysis group, with slightly dilatation, and FITC-
dextran leakage became more diffuse when the rats underwent
a longer period of MCAO. Although FITC-dextran leakage

albumin exacerbate brain edema, and the infarct volume becomes significantly smaller 14 days after treatment compared with
that of 1 day after treatment with no significant difference found among different groups (P>0.05). However, the enhancement
decreases significantly in the combination group compared to the saline or thrombolysis group.

was also found in the combination group, it appeared local and
concentrated mostly in the central region of the ischemic area
(Fig. 5). Sham-operated animals and normal (non-operated)
hemispheres did not show any FITC-dextran leakage.
2.5. BBB leakage based on incidence of
cerebral hemorrhages
Petechial hemorrhages were found in rats when treatment was
initiated 3 h after MCAO (9.1% in both saline and combination
groups; 18.2% in thrombolysis group), and gross hemorrhage

gross hemorrhage was found in the combination group (Table 2).
3. Discussion
In this study we focused on the potential effect of Alb to reduce
delayed thrombolysis-induced damage. Our findings indicated
that in a rat embolic stroke model Alb administration prior to
thrombolysis significantly decreased BBB leakage of small and
large molecules with delayed rt-PA treatment and reduced
the space-occupying effect caused by brain edema, although
there was no apparent reduction in the infarct volumes. Our results
suggest a synergistic effect between Alb and late rt-PA
treatment by reducing brain edema and BBB permeability,
which provides a working strategy for extending the therapeutic
windows for thrombolysis beyond the current 3-hour limit.
Previous studies have focused on extending the thrombolytic
timewindowbyusingabciximab, MMPinhibitor,polynitroxyl albumin
and Alb (Adams et al., 2008; Belayev et al., 1996, 2001;
Dijkhuizen et al., 2002; Gerriets et al., 2004; Pfefferkorn and
Rosenberg, 2003; Sugawara et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2004).
Among these approaches, only abciximab and Alb were evaluated
in clinical trials. However, the phase III trial of intravenous administered
abciximab was terminated prematurely because it
did not demonstrate either safety or efficacy, even though the
dose escalation pilot study and the confirmatory phase II trial
showed potential (Adams et al., 2008). Meanwhile, Alb isa promising
neuroprotective because of its long half-life in circulation
and no side effects to human beings compared to other neuroprotective
agents. Moderate-dose Alb therapy significantly improved
the neurological score and reduced the total infarct
volume when Alb therapy was initiated as late as 4 h after
onset of MCAO (Belayev et al., 2001). Furthermore, experimental
studies and the ALIAS Pilot Clinical Trial supported that tPA
combined with Alb can attenuate the deleterious effect of tPA
and exhibit synergistic effects on thrombolysis initiated within
3 h of stroke onset (Palesch et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2009). To

date, no study has focused on possible synergistic effects between
Alb and late rt-PA treatment (beyond 3 h of stroke
onset). Given that delayed post-ischemic Alb treatment (when
administered as late as 19 h after onset of stroke), while ineffective
, failed to show adverse effects (Belayev et al., 2004), we
attempted to explore whether Alb administration prior to
thrombolysis could eliminate late rt-PA treatment-induced
brain damage. In our study, Alb, administered 3 h after MCAO,
significantly reduced late (3–6 h after stroke) rt-PA treatmentinduced
brain edema and BBB permeability, although the
protective effect was more remarkable when thrombolysis
started 3 h after the onset of MCAO.
After MCAO, brain edema formation is due mainly to an
impaired BBB, resulting in a shift of water from the intravascular
to the extravascular compartments. Massive brain
edema inducing significant midline shift has been detected
in MCAO-induced animals as early as 20–45 min after MCAO,
with the shift continuing to increase linearly thereafter
(Gerriets et al., 2009) and peaking at 24 h after MCAO
(Walberer et al., 2008). In our study we used the MR imaging
technique to monitor the midline shift dynamically at longer
time intervals, and the results indicated that the midline
shift peaked at 24 h after MCAO and was still present at 7
and 14 days after MCAO. Alb and rt-PA combination treatment
led to a significant decline in the space-occupying effect at
24 h, 7 days and 14 days compared to the saline/rt-PA treatment.
However, additional Alb could not prevent or decrease
the incidence of death of rats (16.7%) with delayed thrombolysis
because of the large region of infarction and severe brain
edema, which is similar to previous study (11.1% of rats died
at 24 h after MCAO even when Alb was administered as early
as 2 h after MCAO) (Belayev et al., 1997). Clots flushed into

the ICA in our study mainly obstructed the middle cerebral
artery and distal part of ICA, which caused large territorial
infarction. In this kind of “malignant” stroke, the spaceoccupying
effect is caused by volume expansion of the
affected hemisphere. In other words, brain edema can raise
intracranial pressure and cause lateral and vertical displacement
of brain tissue, leading to midbrain compression, cerebral
herniation, and death (Belayev et al., 2004). The fact that
Alb could reduce the space-occupying effect but failed to
prevent the death of the minor subset of rats in this study
may be due to irreversibly damaged tissue caused by early
herniation even though the midline shift later declined; this
contradiction reflects the fact that the efficacy of Alb on
reducing brain edema is not an elimination of the spaceoccupying
effect. Furthermore, this result suggested that Alb
cannot prevent cerebral herniation with occurrence of large
territory infarction, and additional bilateral craniotomy
should be used to eliminate increased intracranial pressure
(Walberer et al., 2008). Of course, the majority of rats survived
theexperimentinbothourstudyandapreviousonemaybe
due to the residual cortical cerebral blood flow during ischemia,
based on which Alb plays a neuroprotective role in acute stroke
treatment (Chen et al., 2009).
Microvascular barriers are mainly composed of a BBB and
basal lamina. The BBB is formed by interendothelial tight
junctions that allow selective transport, and the basal lamina

rt-PA, with no significant difference between them. However, the enhancement decreases significantly in the combination
group compared to the saline or thrombolysis group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the enhancement decreases remarkably over time
in the combination group especially when treatment was initiated 6 h after MCAO, with no significant difference at different
time points (P=0.054).

is a structural barrier that prevents cellular blood elements
from extravasating from the microvessels (Dijkhuizen et al.,
2002). In our study, BBB leakage of Gd-DTPA after 180- or
360-min MCAO was detected at 24 h, 7 day and 14 days, and
delayed thrombolysis exacerbated this leakage, which was
consistent with previous studies (Dijkhuizen et al., 2001,
2002). BBB leakage for small molecule (Gd-DTPA) and large
molecules (Evans blue and erythrocytes) significantly decreased
in the combination group compared to those in the
saline-/rt-PA-treated group in our study, suggesting that Alb reduced
the BBB permeability with delayed treatment. Previous
studies in a rat model of neonatal stroke also indicated that
Alb could reduce BBB permeability (Wang et al., 2007). The potential
roles of Alb, including inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis
, maintenance of normal endothelial and astrocytic
function, or other unknown mechanisms may contribute to
the reduced BBB permeability (Wang et al., 2007).
Previous research showed that treatment with Alb within
4 h after onset of MCAO significantly reduced the total infarct
volume (Belayev et al., 2001). In our study, however, treatment
with rt-PA combined with Alb resulted in reduced infarct volumes
by a mean of 13% when administered at 3 h after MCAO
and by 6% at 6 h, with no significant differences in the effects
at these times. The difference between the previous study and
ours may be due to the difference in the duration of occlusion
and subsequent thrombolysis. In contrast to a previous study
(Belayev et al., 2001) in which rats were treated 2-hour after
MCAO, treatment for the rats in our study was delayed for 3
or 6 h after MCAO. Over longer periods after MCAO, other effects
such as oxidative stress become involved in the development
of the neural lesion, and Alb alone would fail to reduce
the infarct volume, while antioxidants such as polynitroxyl albumin
can be more effective (Sugawara et al., 2001).
Within 3 h after the onset of MCAO, previous studies have
indicated that rats treated with Alb or Alb in conjunction with
rt-PA had increased CBF compared with those treated with saline
(Belayev et al., 2002; Park et al., 2008; Prado and Ginsberg,
2008). In the current study, however, delayed rt-PA treatment
in conjunction with Alb did not resulted in clear blood volume
improvement. The difference may be due to different measurement
techniques and duration of MCAO. LSCM directly
monitors the peripheral CBF of the ischemic area, whereas
the MRI measures the CBV indirectly and covers both ischemic
core and peripheral area, which could cause the bias in
CBV measurement. Furthermore experiencing longer time period
(more than 3 h) of ischemia, progressive swelling both of
endothelial cells and astrocytes, intravascular thrombi formation
and vasoconstriction may cause microvasculature lumen
compression, which results in hypoperfusion in the ischemic
area. This difference highlights the need to calculate the CBF
directly in further studies.
There are some limitations in this study. In the embolic
stroke model induced by using flushing clots into the ICA,
some clots may have spontaneous dissolved, or failed to occlude
the MCA, and as a result, no neurological deficit, lesion
in the ipso-lateral hemisphere or additional lesion in the contralateral
hemisphere would be observed after MCAO. Therefore
, MRI rather than neurological deficits score must be
used to identify animals which need to be excluded from the
study. The use of a PE-50 catheter was shown to be helpful
in producing precise occlusion of the MCA (Dijkhuizen et al.,
2001), but the insertion of the PE-50 catheter into the orifice
of the MCA can increase the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Furthermore, since partial clot fragmentation after
thrombolysis may occur and lead to the lodging of clot fragments
into smaller downstream arteries and embolize the peripheral
vasculature, this incomplete reperfusion cannot be
differentiated by MRI, and laser Doppler flowmetry is warranted
in our future studies. In addition, both the spaceoccupying
effect and BBB leakage of small molecules were
monitored dynamically, but BBB leakage of large molecules
was evaluated only at one time point after the experiment.
Therefore, we could not obtain any information on Albmediated
reduction of BBB leakage of large molecules dynamically
, and therefore, a large-diameter contrast agent is warranted
in our future studies.
4. Conclusion
In summary, our preliminary study showed that Alb when administered
prior to thrombolysis (3 h after stroke) could decrease
delayed rt-PA treatment -induced brain edema and BBB
permeability. The present findings may provide a basis for the
studyoftheAlb asa pre-hospitalization interventionintheclinical
treatment of stroke patients who missed the effective time
window of thrombolytic therapy. However, randomized clinical
studies focusing on functional outcomes are required before
implementing this strategy as a standard practice.
5. Experimental procedures
5.1. Preparation
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (350 to 400 g) were subjected to embolic
middle cerebral artery occlusion. The experimental protocol
was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the Affiliated Sixth Hospital of Shanghai Jiao
Tong University. All rats had free access to food and water before
the experiment, and their rectal temperatures were monitored
with probes and maintained at 37 °C using a heating
pad. The right and left femoral veins were catheterized for administration
of therapeutic drug and MR contrast agent,
respectively.
5.2. Embolus preparation
The protocol for embolus preparation used herein was modified
from a protocol originally described by Copin et al.
(2008). The femoral artery of the donor rat was catheterized,
blood (0.6 mL) was withdrawn and promptly mixed with
0.15 mL of human thrombin (20 U/mL) within 5 s, a small portion
of this mixture was transferred into an microcatheter
(ExcelsiorTM SL10, Boston Scientific/Target, inner diameter
less than 0.3 mm) and allowed to clot at 37 °C for 2 h. The
clot was subsequently refrigerated for 24 h at 4 °C prior to
use. Then the clot was expelled from microcatheter into a
Petri dish containing deionized water, incubated for 5 min at
room temperature, thereafter transferred into a solution of
81 BRAIN  RESEARCH  1438  (2012)  75– 84
(EVAL PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542-1280232514)
isotonic saline and dissected into 0.8 to 1 mm in length. Finally
, 10 fibrin-rich clots were collected and transferred into
microcatheter connecting to a 1-mL-syring in a volume of
200μL saline for embolism, as they were found to be the optimal
length and number for producing stable ischemia in our
pre-experiment study.
5.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
After the rat was anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
5 mg/kg ketamine chloride, the left common carotid artery
(CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery
(ECA) and pterygopalatine artery (PA) were exposed under the
operating microscope via a midline cervical incision. An approximately
1.0-cm length of the left ECA was tied off. The surgical
and embolization steps proceeded precisely as follows:
1) The left PA was clamped with a 10-mm microaneurysm
clamp; 2) The left CCA was clamped with a 10-mm clamp proximal
to the carotid bifurcation; 3) The left ICA was similarly
clamped between the carotid bifurcation and the PA; 4) The
microcatheter containing the 10 clots was introduced approximately
5 mm into the proximal of left ECA and tied in place
with suture; 5) The left ICA clamp was removed; 6) The 10 emboli
were flushed into the left ICA over a period of approximately
5 s; 7) The left CCA clamp was removed; 8) About 30 s after
the removal of the left CCA clamp, the left PA clamp was removed
, and the rat was left in this condition for 15 min; 9) During
this period, the catheter was removed from the left ECA
stump and tied off on an unperturbed portion of ECA close to
the bifurcation; 10) At the end of the 15-minute period, the incision
was closed. During the operation, rat rectal temperature
was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad. Sham-operated
animals underwent all procedure expect for blocking the middle
cerebral artery. Animals were left on heating pad until
awakening from anesthesia. Two hours after embolic procedure
, rats were tested on a standardized neurobehavioral battery
to quantify the presence of neurological deficit to confirm
the success of MCAO (Belayev et al., 1996).
5.4. Treatment
After successful MCAO, animals were randomly assigned to 1
of 3 groups: 1) thrombolysis group, rt-PA (Behring GmbH, Germany
) were administered intravenously at 3 or 6 h after
MCAO (10 mg/kg, 10% bolus and the remainder continuously
infused over 20 min); 2) combination group, human albumin
(CSL Behring GmbH, Germany) was administered intravenously
(20% solution, 2.5 g/kg, over 10 min) at 3 h after onset
of stroke, thereafter, rt-PA (10 mg/kg) administered intravenously
either at 3 or 6 h after onset of stroke; 3) saline group,
saline was administered intravenously either at 3 or 6 h after
onset of stroke(5 mL/kg). After the treatment, the animals
were allowed to wake from anesthesia on heating pad, then
and have free access to water and food.
5.5. MRI studies
MRIwasperformedineachanimalbyusingaGESigna1.5Tsystem
at 24 h, 7 and 14 days after treatment. During MRI examination
, all rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration
of 5 mg/kg ketamine chloride. A quadrature body coil was used as
a transmitter, and a specially designed 4-cm-diameter cage-like
coil was used as a receiver to provide high -resolution brain images.
T1-(repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]=400/11 ms,) and
T2- (TR/TE=3500/108 ms) weighted images(T2WI) were obtained
using a 3-mm thick section and 0.5 mm intersection space with a
256×160 data matrix, 8×6 mm2field of view. Diffusion-weighted
images (TR/TE=8000/97.8 ms) were acquired with b value of
1000 s/mm2. Dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion MRI (DCE
pMRI, gradient-echo planar sequence, TR/TE=1000 ms/34.7 ms)
in combination with intravenous bolus injection gadopentetate
dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA, 0.2 mmol/kg) was used to check the efficiency
of reperfusion. After DCE pMRI, additional T1WI was performed
as post-contrast T1WI. To avoid image deformity and
improve the signal-to-noise ratio, both DWI and DCE pMRI were
acquired with a matrix 64×64, field of view (FOV) 5×5, thickness
3 mm, and intersection space 0.5 mm.
5.6. Relative cerebral blood volume measurement
To quantify DCE pMRI, regions of interest (ROIs; 2 mm2) were
hand-drawn to cover the parietal cortex and striatum, as
well as homologous areas on the contralateral side. A signal
intensity time curve was obtained over each ROI. The cerebral
blood volume was calculated automatically at the workstation
(SUN Microsoft Ultra 60) using commercially available postprocessing
software (Functool 2.5.36d, GE Medical Systems).
The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was produced
using the following formulas: rCBV=CBV on the ipsilateral
side/CBV on the contralateral side.
5.7. Measurement of ischemic lesion volumes and
space-occupying effect
T2 weighted images at different time points after treatment
were examined to map lesion and hemispheric volumes. All
these T2 weighted images were transferred to a personal computer
with imaging analysis software (LEICA Qwin imaging
analysis system, Germany).The position of brain midline was
determined using neuroanatomic landmarks, such as cerebral
falx, corpus pineale, cerebral longitudinal fissure, 3rd ventricle
, and aqueductus mesencephalii. Lesions were determined
by computer-aided manual tracing of the hyperintense lesion
on each T2WI. Two investigators (Lu, HT, and Li YD) blinded to
the experimental groups outlined the zones of infarction as
well as the left-and right-hemisphere contours at each level.
Volumes of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
and volumes of the lesion were calculated by summing up
the volumes from each slice. Hemispheric ischemic lesion
volumes (not corrected for brain edema, % HLVu), hemispheric
ischemic lesion volumes corrected for brain edema (% HLVe)
were calculated using the following equation:
%HLVu¼ 2LV= HVcþHVi ð Þ ð Þ 100;
%HLVe¼ HVc−HViþLV ð Þ =HVc ð Þ 100:
Where HVc and HVi are, respectively, the contralateral and
ipsilateral hemispheric volume, and LV, the lesion volume.
The space-occupying effect due to brain edema (% SOE,
expressed as the volume increase of the affected hemisphere)

was calculated as follows: % SOE=%HLVU−%HLVe, as previously
described (Belayev et al., 1996).
5.8. Evaluation of BBB leakage by MRI
Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI has previously been used for assessment
of BBB leakage, in our study post-contrast T1WI
was performed at 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after treatment
to evaluate the BBB leakage dynamically. To quantify the
BBB leakage, two investigators (Lu HT, and Li YD) blinded
to the experimental groups delineated the zones of enhancement
on T1WI. The enhancement score (semi-quantification
of the BBB leakage) was marked as 1 or 2 when
enhancement located in parietal cortex or striatum, or
both parietal cortex and striatum respectively, whereas, no
enhancement was found on T1WI, the enhancement score
was labeled as 0.
5.9. Evaluation of BBB leakage by FITC-dextran
Fourteen days after MCAO, fluoro-isothiocyanate dextran
(FITC-dextran, SIGMA, USA; 1 mL at of 50 mg/mL preparation)
was administered intravenously to animals in each group.
After the FITC-dextran had circulated for 1 min, the brains
were rapidly removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
4 °C for 24 h. Their brains were coronally sectioned (2 mm
thick interval), and the sections containing parietal cortex and
striatum (both of which are usually affected in the MCAO
model) were further cut (50μm thick) on a vibration microtome
for BBB leakage study. All these sections were analyzed by laser
scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM; LSM510-Zeiss, Germany),
and the green fluorochromes in each section were excited by a
laser beam at 488 nm. Using tissue samples from each rat, 10
sections at 2 mm intervals were scanned under 5× objective
lens to find the areas of FITC-dextran leakage. After scanning,
each section was assessed using the LEICA Qwin imaging analysis
system (Germany).
5.10. Evaluation of BBB leakage by cerebral hemorrhage
The remainder of the brain was stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (HE) for evaluation of hemorrhages. Hemorrhages on
histological sections were classified as gross hemorrhage
(GH, defined as blood evident to the unaided eye on the
H&E-stained coronal sections), petechial hemorrhage (PH, defined
as a cluster of red blood cells outside of the lumen of
blood vessels) or no hemorrhage (NH).
5.11. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means±SD, the infarct volumes, spaceoccupying
effect and rCBV within groups between different
time points were estimated with the General Linear Model Univariate
test, and the post-hoc Least-Significant-Difference test
was used to perform all pairwise comparison. The difference
of the enhancement score between the different groups over
time was assessed by using Chi-square test. The statistical
tests were performed by using software (SPSS, version 13.0;
SPSS Chicago, Ill), and P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically
significance difference.
