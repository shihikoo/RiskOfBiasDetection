Abstract
Cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in rodents has been proposed
as  an  experimental  model  of  white  matter  damage  and  vascular  dementia.  However,  the  histopathological  and
behavioral alterations reported in this model are variable and a full characterization of the dynamic alterations is not
available. Here we implemented a longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) design, including timeof-flight
angiography, high resolution T1-weighted images, T2 relaxometry mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and
cerebral blood flow measurements up to 12 weeks after BCCAo or sham-operation in Wistar rats. Changes in MRI
were  related  to  behavioral  performance  in  executive  function  tasks  and  histopathological  alterations  in  the  same
animals. MRI frequently (70%) showed various degrees of acute ischemic lesions, ranging from very small to large
subcortical infarctions. Independently, delayed MRI changes were also apparent. The patterns of MRI alterations
were related to either ischemic necrosis or gliosis. Progressive microstructural changes revealed by diffusion tensor
imaging in white matter were confirmed by observation of myelinated fiber degeneration, including severe optic tract
degeneration.  The  latter  interfered  with  the  visually  cued  learning  paradigms  used  to  test  executive  functions.
Independently of brain damage, BCCAo induced progressive arteriogenesis in the vertebrobasilar tree, a process
that was associated with blood flow recovery after 12 weeks. The structural alterations found in the basilar artery
were compatible with compensatory adaptive changes driven by shear stress. In summary, BCCAo in rats induces
specific signatures in multimodal MRI that are compatible with various types of histological lesion and with marked
adaptive arteriogenesis.

Introduction
Cerebrovascular  pathology  is  involved  in  several  forms  of
dementia.  Vascular  changes  such  as  arterial  stiffness,
arteriolosclerosis,  endothelial  degeneration,  and  blood-brain
barrier dysfunction are often associated with chronic cerebral
hypoperfusion in disorders of the aging human brain [1]. On an
etiological  basis,  several  subtypes  of  vascular  cognitive
impairment have been proposed [2], the most prominent being
multi-infarct  dementia,  mixed  cortical  and  subcortical  infarct
dementia, small vessel disease, subcortical ischemic vascular
disease,  and  CADASIL  (Cerebral  Autosomal  Dominant
Arteriopathy  with  Subcortical  Infarcts  and
Leukoencephalopathy).  Affecting  deep  penetrating  arteries,
small vessel disease causes lacunar infarcts and diffuse white
matter  lesions,  and  it  is  associated  with  vascular  cognitive

impairment  [3].  Given  the  prevalence  of  subcortical  ischemic
vascular disease, there are considerable research efforts focus
on  this  condition.  Indeed,  chronic  hypoperfusion,  for  instance
resulting from atherosclerosis, can lead to complete (lacunae)
or  incomplete  stroke.  The  latter  manifests  as  diffuse  white
matter lesions (leukoaraiosis) that typically affect the prefrontosubcortical
 circuits,  which  may  explain  some  of  the  cognitive
deficits often associated with executive functions.
In experimental animals, cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates
cerebral amyloid angiopathy, promotes cortical microinfarcts in
a mouse model [4], and induces cognitive deficits at an early
stage  of  amyloid  pathology  in  a  transgenic  mouse  model  of
Alzheimer’s  disease  [5].  Bilateral  common  carotid  artery
occlusion (BCCAo) in rats has been proposed as a model of
vascular  dementia  and  has  been  widely  used  over  recent
years. However, the studies performed to date show variable
results [6,7,8,9] because of the different structures addressed
and  the  different  time  points  and  techniques  used.  Overall,
brain  damage  is  characterized  by  white  matter  lesions,  with
vacuolation  of  myelin,  axonal  damage,  and  demyelination  in
the  corpus  callosum,  internal  capsule,  and  caudate/putamen
[8].  BCCAo-induced  oligemia  has  a  transient  effect  on  the
neocortex and a long-lasting effect on white matter structures
[10]. Gradual hippocampal injury coursing with astrogliosis and
microglial activation has been observed in animals at several
time  points  after  BCCAo.  Nonetheless,  some  of  these
histopathological  changes  after  BCCAo  in  rats  are  straindependent
[6].
Cerebral  blood  flow  (CBF)  after  BCCAo  shows  an  acute
ischemic phase lasting 2-3 days, followed by a chronic oligemic
phase of approximately 3 months, after which the blood flow is
restored to normal levels [11,12]. This latter effect is attributed
to a key vascular remodeling phenomenon that accompanies
long-lasting hypoperfusion. Thus, the occlusion of one carotid
artery and both vertebral arteries leads to the enlargement of
the  ipsilateral  posterior  cerebral  artery  3  weeks  after  the
surgery  [11].  Along  the  same  line,  Choy  et  al.  [12]
demonstrated  an  increased  diameter  of  various  cerebral
arteries 6 months after BCCAo, as assessed by post-mortem
India ink angiograms. The dilation and enlargement of some of
these  arteries  was  confirmed  1  month  after  BCCAo  by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography [13]. However,
the temporal pattern of arteriogenic and parenchymal changes
after BCCAo has not been described to date. Here we used a
non-invasive quantitative method to assess the progression of
morphological alterations of the main cerebral arteries in living
rats  subjected  to  BCCAo  and  carried  out  longitudinal  MRI
studies  to  identify  structural  and  microstructural  brain
alterations, followed by histological validation of tissue damage.
The arterial MRI changes induced by BCCAo were related to
CBF  and  to  vascular  structural  integrity,  as  assessed  in
dissected arteries. In addition, several cognitive executive skills
were  tested  longitudinally  in  these  animals  using  an  operant
conditioned paradigm, and the results were correlated with the
alterations observed by MRI and histology.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Experiments  were  performed  in  adult  male  Wistar  rats,
weighing 300–320 g at the beginning of the study. Rats were
housed in cages under controlled temperature (21 ± 1°C) and
humidity  (55  ±  10%),  with  a  12-h  light/12-h  dark  cycle  (light
between  8:00  AM  and  8:00  PM).  Food  and  water  were
available ad  libitum  during  all  experiments.  Animal  work  was
performed  following  the  local  legislation  (Decret  214/1997  of
July  30th  by  the  ‘Departament  d’Agricultura,  Ramaderia  i
Pesca de la Generalitat de Catalunya’) under the approval of
the Ethical Committee of the University of Barcelona (CEEA),
and in compliance with European legislation.
Surgery
Rats were anaesthetized under 4% isofluorane in a mixture
of  30%  O
2
  and  70%  N
2
O,  and  then  maintained  under  1.5%
isofluorane.  They  were  allowed  to  breath  spontaneously
throughout surgery. Body temperature was monitored using a
rectal  probe  and  maintained  between  36.5°C  and  37.5°C.
Animals  were  randomly  selected  for  BCCAo  (n=17)  or  sham
(n=13) surgery. A ventral midline incision was made to expose
the  common  carotid  arteries,  which  were  carefully  separated
from the vagus nerves. Both common carotid arteries were tied
off  with  two  3-0  sutures  (Suturas  Aragó,  Barcelona,  Spain)
before the bifurcation of the internal and the external carotids.
The  first  carotid  to  be  occluded,  either  right  or  left,  was
alternated  throughout  the  experiment.  Sham  animals
underwent  the  same  surgical  procedure  except  for  the
occlusion of the two carotids.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI experiments were conducted on a 7.0 T BioSpec 70/30
horizontal  animal  scanner  (Bruker  BioSpin,  Ettlingen,
Germany), equipped with an actively shielded gradient system
(400 mT/m, 12 cm inner diameter). The receiver coil was a 4-
channel  phased-array  surface  coil  for  the  rat  brain.  Animals
were placed in supine position in a Plexiglas holder with a nose
cone for administering anaesthetic gases (1.5% isofluorane in
a  mixture  of  30%  O
2
  and  70%  CO
2
)  and  were  fixed  using  a
tooth bar, ear bars and adhesive tape. Tripilot scans were used
to ensure accurate positioning of the head in the isocenter of
the magnet.
For  the  quantification  of  the  vascular  remodeling  timecourse
,  time-of-flight  (TOF)  angiography  with  a  threedimensional
(3D) Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) method was
acquired before the surgery (pre-occlusion) and 2 h, 24 h, 10
days  and  3,  7  and  12  weeks  after  BCCAo  (n=10)  or  shamoperation
 (n=6).  The  scan  parameters  were  as  follows:  echo
time (TE) = 2.5 ms, repetition time (TR) = 15 ms, field of view
(FOV) = 35 x 35 x 50 mm, matrix size = 256x 256 x 128 pixels,
resulting in a spatial resolution of 0.137 x 0.137 x 0.39 mm.
At  the  same  time  points,  brain  lesions  were  evaluated
longitudinally by T2 mapping of coronal slices acquired with a
multislice-multi-echo  (MSME)  sequence  by  applying  16  TEs,
from  11  to  176  ms,  TR  =  4764  ms,  slice  thickness  =  1  mm,
number of slices = 18, FOV = 40 x 40 mm, and matrix size =

256x  256  pixels,  resulting  in  a  spatial  resolution  of  0.156  x
0.156 mm in 1.00 mm slice thickness.
For registration purposes and longitudinal evaluation of other
structural  alterations  that  were  not  observable  in  T2
relaxometry  maps,  high  resolution  3D  Modified  Driven
Equilibrium Fourier Transform (MDEFT) images were acquired
at the same time points, as above. The scan parameters were
as follows: TE = 3.5 ms, TR = 4000 ms, 8 segments and the
same geometry as T2 maps except for slice thickness, which
was 0.5 mm.
To study microsctructural changes, Diffusion Tensor Imaging
(DTI) was performed 7 weeks after BCCAo or sham surgery,
using an echo planar imaging DTI sequence with TR = 14500
ms,  TE  =  30.85  ms,  four  segments,  b-value  =  1000,  126
diffusion  directions,  five  B0  images,  FOV  =  22.23  x  22.23  x
17.92  mm,  matrix  size  =  72x  72  x  58  pixels,  resulting  in  an
isometric spatial resolution of 0.309 x 0.309 x 0.309 mm and an
acquisition time of 2 h 6 min.
For  cerebral  perfusion  measurements  12  weeks  after
BCCAo, a T2 * sensitive version of the Echo Planar Imaging
(EPI) sequence was used, TE = 18.7 ms, TR = 160 ms, slice
thickness = 1 mm, number of slices = 18, FOV = 30 x 30 mm,
matrix size = 234x 256 pixels, resulting in a spatial resolution of
0.234  x  0.234  mm  in  2.00  mm  slice  thickness,  and  2100
repetitions  were  recorded  consecutively  within  a  total
acquisition  time  of  5  min  36  s.  Thus,  the  recording  time  per
volume was 0.16 s. Gadolinium bolus track experiments were
performed in 3 coronal planes. The first 2 min (750 volumes)
were  used  as  baseline,  then  a  bolus  of  0.5  mmol/kg  of
gadodiamide (Omniscan™, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, S.A.,
Madrid, Spain) was injected into the femoral vein over a 20-s
interval  (125  volumes),  and  the  experiment  finished  with  an
additional 3 min 36 s of recording (1350 volumes).
A scheme of the timeline for the whole experimental design
is shown in Figure S1.
Image processing
The images resulting from TOF angiography were subjected
to  a  post-processing  procedure  performed  with  specific
software  for  scientific  image  processing  and  visualization
(Amira, Visage Image, Inc). The procedure consisted of several
steps, namely signal intensity correction (for the signal decay
induced  by  the  surface  coil),  brain  masking,  skull  stripping,
background  removal,  semi-automatic  segmentation  of  the
vertebro-basilar  artery,  right  and  left  middle  cerebral  arteries,
and  azygos-pericallosal  artery  and,  finally,  skeletonization  of
the segmented arteries. The images acquired after BCCAo or
sham-operation were affine-registered to their respective preocclusion
 scan  so  that  the  same  brain  mask  and  artery
segmentation  could  be  applied  to  all  time  points  with  minor
manual  editing.  Subsequently,  arterial  length  and  arterial
tortuosity  were  measured  from  the  artery  skeleton.  For
vertebro-basilar  arteries,  the  ratio  between  the  hypothetical
minimum  length  and  the  true  length  was  expressed  as  the
arterial  tortuosity.  A  third  parameter  related  to  vascular
remodeling  was  calculated  from  the  Maximal  Intensity
Projection (MIP) of the cropped base of the brain (Figure S2).
The ratio between the area occupied by the projected arteries
and  the  area  of  the  brain  projection  were  calculated  for  all
acquired time points in sham and BCCAo animals.
T2  maps  and  MDEFT  images  were  reconstructed  with
Paravision  5.0  software  (Bruker  Biospin,  Etlingen,  Germany)
and custom-made programs written in Matlab (The MathWorks,
Inc.,  Natick,  MA,  USA).  The  volume  of  focal  lesions  was
estimated in the T2 maps after manual delineation of the region
showing  increased  T2  values  (range  used:  20-150  ms).  The
areas were then integrated to calculate the volume. Moreover,
the presence and number of hyperintense areas in the striatum
and  the  cortex  on  MDEFT  images  were  determined  for  each
animal  at  each  acquired  time  point.  All  analyses  were
performed  blinded  to  the  treatment  and  by  the  same
experimenter in order to avoid inter-individual differences.
DTI images were studied using a voxel based analysis (VBA)
approach as previously described in [14]. Briefly, all rat brains
were  registered  to  a  reference  brain  by  means  of  an  affine
registration  that  maximized  mutual  information  of  fractional
anisotropy (FA) volume followed by an elastic warping based
on  diffeomorphic  demons  [15]  available  in  MedINRIA  1.9.4
software. Registered volumes were smoothed with a Gaussian
kernel of 3 x 3 x 3 voxels with a standard deviation of one voxel
to  compensate  for  possible  misregistrations.  Voxel-wise
statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) was performed, obtaining
the voxels with a statistically significant different distribution of
diffusion-  related  parameters  between  sham  and  BCCAo
animals.  Note  that  the  results  may  be  biased  by  this  choice
since VBA requires the definition of a reference brain. In order
to avoid such bias and increase the reliability of the results, the
VBA  procedure  was  repeated  taking  all  animals  as  template,
and only the regions where differences appeared consistently
among the different templates were considered. In this way, the
variability  produced  by  the  arbitrary  choice  of  the  reference
template was discarded.
For  cerebral  perfusion  imaging,  three  regions  of  interest
(ROI)  were  drawn  in  each  hemisphere  from  T2*-EPI  images
(medial  prefrontal  cortex,  caudate-putamen  and  retrosplenial
cortex, Figure S3). The time-course of the signal intensity was
calculated  for  each  pixel,  and  the  average  values  were
calculated  for  each  ROI.  Data  were  processed  with  custommade
programs written in Matlab as previously described [16]
with minor modifications. Briefly, in order to obtain relative brain
perfusion  parameters,  we  calculated  the  following:  the
maximum  of  the  signal  intensity  curve;  the  time  interval  from
reaching  the  gadolinium  to  the  moment  of  the  maximum
concentration, or time to peak (TTP); the area under the curve
(AUC),  which  provides  an  estimation  of  the  relative  cerebral
blood volume (relCBV); and the estimated mean transit time,
calculated  as  the  full  width  of  the  curve  at  half  maximum
(FWHM).  Relative  CBF  (relCBF)  was  obtained  from  the  ratio
relCBV/FWHM.
Reversal learning and set-shifting behavioral tasks
A separate group of animals was used for behavioral testing
(sham n= 7, BCCAo n=7).
Apparatus.  Behavioral testing took place within two operant
conditioning chambers (30 cm×24 cm×30 cm; Med Associates,
Georgia, VT), each placed in a sound-attenuating wooden box

fitted  with  a  fan  for  ventilation  and  masking  of  extraneous
noise.  Each  chamber  was  fitted  with  two  levers  located  on
either side of a centrally positioned food magazine, into which
an  external  pellet  dispenser  delivering  45-mg  pellets  was
placed  (Noyes  dustless  pellets;  Rodent  grain-based  diet;
BioServ,  Phymep,  Paris,  FR).  Each  chamber  had  a  lightemitting
diode (LED) positioned centrally above each lever, a
magazine  light,  and  a  house  light.  Magazine  entry  was
detected  by  an  infrared  photocell  beam  located  horizontally
across  the  entrance.  The  apparatus  was  controlled  by
MEDPCIV software.
Behavioral  training  and  testing.    The  operant  training
protocols  were  based  on  those  described  in  [17]  with  minor
modifications.  Rats  underwent  a  pre-training  phase  prior  to
sham or BCCAo surgery to allow familiarization with the testing
apparatus. Animals were trained under a fixed ratio of 1 and 3
schedules on each lever separately, followed by the acquisition
of  a  two-lever  spatial  discrimination  task  as  previously
described [18]. Each rat had one training session per day and
was  trained  to  reach  a  criterion  of  nine  correct  trials  in  two
consecutive blocks of 10 trials (binomial distribution p < 0.01,
likelihood  of  attaining  criterion  in  a  10-trial  block).  Once  the
criterion  was  reached,  the  initial  discrimination  phase  was
considered complete, and the animal was returned to the home
cage.  If  the  criterion  was  not  achieved,  this  phase  was
repeated the next day until criterion achievement.
After this training period, animals were randomly separated
into groups and subjected to sham or BCCAo surgery. After 10
days  of  recovery  (and  acquisition  of  the  second  MRI  scans),
rats were retested on discrimination and once the criterion was
achieved  the  reversal  phase  started.  This  process  was
repeated after each subsequent scan time, namely at 3 and 7
weeks after BCCAo or sham surgery.
Set-shifting  task.    Twelve  weeks  after  BCCAo  or  sham
surgery,  animals  underwent  a  final  spatial  response  rediscrimination
 step,  and  the  set-shifting  task  was  tested  as
follows.  This  task  required  the  animal  to  cease  following  an
egocentric spatial response strategy and instead use a visualcue
 discrimination  strategy  to  obtain  food  reward  [19].  The
previous  random  light  presented  over  the  levers  during  the
response  interval  was  now  the  conditioned  stimulus,  which
indicated the active lever. Trials were performed in a manner
identical  to  the  initial  spatial  response  discrimination  ones.
Trials continued until the rat performed nine correct trials in two
consecutive blocks of 10 trials. Again, when an animal did not
achieve the criterion on the first day of training, it received an
identical  session  of  visual-cue  discrimination  training  on  the
following day.
Tissue preparation, histochemical and
immunohistochemical studies
After  the  last  MRI  acquisition  (12  weeks),  animals  were
anesthetized with isofluorane and transcardially perfused with
saline  followed  by  4%  paraformaldehyde  in  0.1M  phosphatebuffered
 saline  (PBS)  (pH=7.4).  Afterwards,  the  brains  were
removed  and  the  basilar  (BA)  and  middle  cerebral  (MCA)
arteries  were  isolated.  Brains  were  postfixed  overnight  in  the
same fixative at 4 °C, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin.
The brains were cut (5 µm) in coronal slices at different levels
from Bregma (Bregma +3.7, +0.2, and -3.14) following the atlas
of Paxinos and Watson (1996) and using a microtome (Leica,
Microsystems,  Wetzelar,  Germany).  Cellular  damage  was
assessed  by  hematoxylin  and  eosin  (HE)  staining.  Klüver-
Barrera Luxol fast blue (Luxol) staining was used to evaluate
myelin  damage.  Immunohistochemistry  against  glial  fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP, a specific marker of astroglial cells) and
against  Iba-1  (a  specific  marker  of  reactive  microglia/
macrophages) was carried out to reveal signs of glial reaction.
The  rabbit  polyclonal  antibodies  against  GFAP  and  Iba-1
(Dako,  Dakopats,  USA)  were  diluted  at  1:500  in  PBS
containing  0.3%  Triton-X100  and  0.2%  gelatin.  The
immunocytochemical procedure has been described elsewhere
[20]. Briefly, sections were rehydrated and incubated overnight
with  the  corresponding  primary  antibody  in  a  humidified
chamber  at  4  °C  and  then  incubated  for  1  h  at  room
temperature  with  the  appropriate  biotinylated  second
antibodies,  diluted  1:200  (goat  anti-rabbit  IgG)  (Vector
Laboratories,  USA).  All  sections  were  incubated  with  avidinbiotin-horseradish
 peroxidase  complex  1:100  (ABC  kit,
Vectastain,  Vector  Laboratories)  for  1  h.  Peroxidase  labeling
was  visualized  with  a  solution  containing  0.025%
diaminobenzidine  (Sigma  Aldrich)  and  0.03%  H
2
O
2
(Sigma
Aldrich) in PBS. In each experiment, a tissue section was also
processed in parallel without the primary antibody as a control
for non-specific staining.
For  quantitative  analysis,  images  of  the  corpus  callosum
(CC)  and  of  the  optic  tract  were  taken  though  an  optical
microscope with a x 40 objective connected to a digital camera,
and the analyses were performed using NIH ImageJ software.
Myelin fiber density was determined using a threshold that was
fixed  for  all  images,  and  values  were  expressed  as  percent
density  of  myelin  fibers  per  field.  The  number  of  Iba1-
immunopositive cells was counted in fields of 0.075 mm2. The
quantification was performed in at least 3 representative fields
per region and rat, and the numbers were averaged and the
values expressed as the mean ± SEM.
The dissected arteries were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 45
min  and  washed  in  three  changes  of  PBS.  After  cleaning,
vessels were placed overnight in PBS containing 30% sucrose.
They  were  then  transferred  to  a  cryomold  (Bayer  Química
Farmacéutica,  Barcelona,  Spain)  containing  Tissue  Tek  OCT
embedding  medium  (Sakura  Finetek,  Europe,  The
Netherlands) for 20 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen
transverse  sections  (14µm)  of  BA  and  MCA  were  cut  onto
gelatin-coated  slides  and  air-dried  for  at  least  90  min.  After
blockade,  sections  were  incubated  with  a  rabbit  polyclonal
antibody  against  collagen  I/III  (1:30;  Calbiochem,  Pacific
Center  Court,  San  Diego,  CA,  USA)  in  PBS  containing  2%
bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  for  1  h  at  37°C  in  a  humidified
chamber.  After  washing,  rings  were  incubated  with  the
secondary  antibody,  a  donkey  anti-rabbit  IgG  conjugated  to
CyTM3  (1:200;  Jackson  Immunoresearch  Laboratories  Inc.,
West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37°C in a humid chamber.
After  washing,  sections  were  stained  with  the  nuclear  dye
Hoechst 33342 (0.01 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 15 min followed
by 3 washes in PBS. Immunofluorescent signals were viewed

microscope  with  an  oil  immersion  lens  (x20).  CyTM3-labeled
antibody was visualized by excitation at 568 nm and detection
at 600-700 nm. The specificity of collagen I/III immunostaining
was  evaluated  by  omission  of  the  primary  antibody  and
processed as above. Under these conditions, no staining was
observed  in  the  vessel  wall  in  any  experimental  condition.
Quantitative analyses of collagen I/III fluorescence and nuclei
number  were  performed  with  MetaMorph  4.6  Image  Analysis
Software  (Universal  Imaging,  Molecular  Devices,
Downingtown,  PA,  USA).  The  intensity  of  fluorescence  per
area  was  calculated  in  three  rings  of  each  animal,  and  the
results  were  expressed  in  arbitrary  units.  To  evaluate  the
number of smooth muscle cells/ring the autofluorescence of the
elastic laminae was used to identify the media. In addition, the
nuclear shape of the different cell types, visualized by Hoesch
33342,  confirms  the  presence  of  smooth  muscle  cells  in  the
media (see Figure S4). The number of nuclei was counted in
three rings of each animal, and the results were expressed as
cell  density.  All  measurements  were  conducted  in  a  blind
fashion.
Vessel morphometry
Morphometric  assessment  of  the  lumen,  media  and  vessel
areas  was  performed  in  coronal  sections  of  the  dissected
arteries  using  MetaMorph  4.6  Image  Analysis  Software,  as
previously described [21]. To determine the luminal area, the
cross-sectional  area  enclosed  by  the  internal  elastic  lamina
was corrected to a circle by applying the form factor l2/4π to
the measurement of the internal elastic lamina, where l is the
length of the lamina. The vessel area was determined by the
cross-sectional  area  enclosed  by  the  external  elastic  lamina
corrected to a circle by applying the same form factor (l2/4π) to
the  measurement  of  the  external  elastic  lamina.  Internal  and
external  diameters  were  calculated  from  luminal  and  vessel
areas,  respectively.  Structural  parameters  were  calculated  as
follows:  cross-sectional  area  (CSA)  =  le  –  li;  wall  thickness
(WT) = (De - Di)/2 and wall/lumen (W/L) ratio = WT/Di, where
le  is  the  vessel  area,  li  the  luminal  area,  De  the  external
diameter,  and  Di  the  internal  diameter.  Mean  values  were
obtained  from  three  sections  of  each  dissected  artery  from
BCCAo (n=6) and sham (n=5) animals.
Statistical analysis
The  length  and  tortuosity  of  the  arteries  and  vascular
network quantification were analyzed using a two-way analysis
of  variance  (ANOVA),  with  treatment  (BCCAo-  or  shamoperated
animals) as the ‘between’ factor and time (days) as
the ‘within-subject’ factor. When significant overall interactions
were found, further analyses of partial interactions were carried
out.  Post-hoc  analyses  for  intergroup  comparisons  were
performed with Fisher’s least significant differences (LSD) test
when the initial p value was significant. All data were analyzed
using  Statistica  software  (StatSoft  Inc.,  France).  Differences
were  considered  significant  when P<  0.05.  All  results  are
expressed  as  mean  ±  SEM.  Data  from  arteries  and  brain
histology  and  immunohistochemistry,  and  gadolinium  bolus
track  measurements  and  behavior  were  analyzed  using  an
unpaired Student’s t-test and two-way ANOVA, respectively. In
all cases, data analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism
4 Software. A value of P< 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Tissue alterations assessed with MRI
The presence of acute ischemic focuses was evaluated with
T2 relaxometry mapping 24 h after BCCAo or sham-operation.
In  70%  of  the  rats,  BCCAo  induced  unilateral  focal  acute
damage manifested as areas of increased T2 values located in
the striatum with widely variable sizes ranging from 1.7 mm3to
27.13  mm3.  Acute  lesions  tended  to  be  more  frequent  in  the
right  (6  out  of  10)  than  in  the  left  (3  out  of  10)  striatum,  but
differences were not statistically significant (Chi-square test =
1.82, P>  0.05).  Figure  S5  shows  an  incidence  map  of  all
ischemic  lesions  observed  24  h  after  BCCAo.  The  same
lesions were observed as hypointense zones in the 3D MDEFT
T1-weighted  images.  Coronal  sections  of  two  representative
BCCAo  animals  illustrating  the  largest  and  smallest  tissue
lesion are shown in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively, at several
time points and with the MRI modalities used in this study. In
the  MDEFT  images,  acute  damage  was  observed  as  a
hypointense zone while adjacent areas and secondary injuries
were seen as hyperintense zones (Figure 1). The size of the
acute MDEFT hypointense areas decreased with time and was
progressively  substituted  by  hyperintense  signals  that
surrounded the hypointense core. MDEFT provided a contrast
superior than that obtained in T2-weighted images and maps
for the progressive evolution of the tissue lesion.
Bilateral striatal increases in T2 values were not observed 24
h after BCCAo; however, in 20% of the rats, bilateral alterations
became  apparent  at  day  10.  These  delayed  MRI  alterations
were  manifested  as  hyperintensities  in  MDEFT  from  day  10
onwards,  corresponding  with  decreased  T2  values  in  regions
showing no apparent T2 alterations at 24 h (see left striatum at
24  h  in  upper  and  middle  row  of  Figure  1A).  These  lesions
were therefore more delayed than the acute ischemic lesions.
In  addition,  they  showed  distinct  MRI  features  to  those
observed  in  the  acute  ischemic  zones  and  were  found  in
subcortical regions (striatum).
DTI  identified  alterations  in  multiple  grey  and  white  matter
areas (Figure 2). Indeed, VBA showed a significant decrease in
FA values in BCCAo compared to sham animals in structures
such  as  the  piriform,  frontal  and  insular  cortical  regions,
hippocampus,  thalamus,  and  optical  nerve  and  tract,  while
significant  increase  in  FA  values  was  observed  in  the  lateral
striatum (Figure 2, FA). Mean and radial diffusivities (Figure 2,
MD  and  RD)  were  significantly  reduced  in  the  cingulum  and
increased in the lateral striatum of BCCAo versus sham rats.
Furthermore, axial diffusivity (AD) was significantly increased in
the striatum of BCCAo compared to sham rats, possibly as a
result of the multiple focal lesions previously described in some
animals (Figure 2, AD). The means of the four DTI indexes for
the above-described areas are shown in Table S3.

Immunohistochemical evaluation of brain tissue
alterations
Relation  of  MRI  changes  and  histological
damage.    Necrotic  zones  (hematoxylin-eosin)  with  activated
microglia/macrophages  (Iba-1+)  surrounded  by  an  astroglial
scar (GFAP+) (Figure 3A-D) were observed at 12 weeks in the
striatum  of  all  BCCAo  rats  previously  showing  an  acute
increase  of  T2  values  (hypointensities  in  MDEFT  images).
Histological  alterations  were  not  detected  in  sham-operated
rats.  The  anatomical  distribution  of  the  areas  showing  glial
reaction matched those affected in MRI. In an attempt to relate
hyper-  and  hypo-intensities  in  MRI  images  with  the  type  of
histological changes, we show the same rat in Figure 1A and
Figure 3. The zone that was hypointense in the right striatum in
MDEFT  (Figure  1A)  at  12  weeks  (time  of  postmortem
histological  study)  corresponds  to  a  necrotic  core  that  was
surrounded  by  a  strong  glial  reaction  (Figure  3C-D,  I-L)
manifested  as  a  hyperintense  ring  in  MDEFT  images
(decreased T2 values in relaxometry maps) (e.g. right striatum
in  Figure  1A  highlighted  in  the  box).  In  addition  to  the  acute
MRI  alterations,  delayed  MRI  changes  manifested  as
Figure 1. Longitudinal multimodal MRI.  Representative coronal section of two BCCAO animals (A, B) are shown at different time
points.  BCCAO  induced  variable  degrees  of  focal  acute  ischemic  lesions  (see  right  striatum  at  24  h  in  A  and  B)  and  delayed
damage (see left striatum from day 10). For both animals (A, B), images in first row are T2-weighted (T2W), second row are T2
relaxometry map (T2R) and third row are 3D MDEFT T1-weighted (MDEFT) images. The box highlights MDEFT alterations at 12
weeks in the same animal shown in Figure 3 for histological damage. Color scale represents T2 relaxometry time (ms) for images
shown in second row of panels A and S (T2R).

hyperintense  signals  in  3D  MDEFT  T1  images  (e.g.  left
striatum  in  Figure  1A  in  the  section  highlighted  in  the  box)
(decreased T2 values in relaxometry maps) in the absence of
acute T2 alterations were seen in some animals. These MRI
changes  corresponded  to  zones  of  abundant  gliosis  at  12
weeks. The presence of gliosis in zones lacking signs of acute
infarction is compatible with progressive neuronal death and/or
axonal  degeneration  subsequent  to  insufficient  blood  supply
after BCCAo.
White matter alterations.  Alterations in the white matter, as
assessed  with  Luxol  Fast  blue  myelin  staining,  were
manifested  by  the  disarrangement  of  the  nerve  fibers,  the
formation  of  marked  vacuoles,  and  the  disappearance  of
myelinated  fibers  (Figure  3G,  H,  S).  These  pathological
changes were accompanied by astrogliosis (Figure 3I, J) and
microgliosis (Figure 3K, L) and were seen in all striatal regions
showing  acute  MRI  changes  (e.g.  Figure  3H,  J,  L  vs. Figure
1A-right  striatum),  in  agreement  with  the  DTI  changes
observed  at  the  same  level  (Figure  2,  decrease  in  FA  and
increased AD in the striatum). To a lower extent, astrogliosis
and  microgliosis  were  also  detected  in  regions  that  did  not
show acute MRI alterations (Figure 3G, I, K vs. Figure 1A-left
striatum).  Regions  showing  severe  white  matter  alterations
included  the  optic  tract  (manifested  in  all  BCCAo  rats,  see
Figure  2. Statistical  maps  showing  Diffusion  Tensor  Imaging  (DTI)  indexes.    Regions  showing  statistically  significant
differences of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), between sham and
BCCAo animals 7 weeks after surgery. Background images are the corresponding averaged DTI index calculated for the sham
group (left: coronal, middle: sagittal, and right: axial slices). Red areas (sham > BCCAo) have a significance of P <0.05 (Mann-
Whitney U test). Blue areas (sham < BCCAo) have a significance of P<0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test). The slices show representative
anatomical structures (see Results section for details).

BCCAo rats), and –with less intensity- the CC. Densitometric
analysis  in  the  genus  of  the  CC  showed  a  statistically
significant  reduction  in  myelin  fiber  density  (P<  0.01)  (Figure
3t).  These  histological  results  are  in  agreement  with  the
decreased FA observed in the optic tract and nerve (Figure 2).
Optic tract degeneration.  Twelve weeks after surgery, all
BCCAo rats showed macroscopic signs of optic nerve damage
with  varying  degrees  of  degeneration  affecting  the  total  or
partial  length  of  the  tract.  Figure  4A  shows  macroscopic
images  of  representative  perfused  brains  (ventral  view)  of
sham-operated  rats  showing  preserved  optic  tracts  and  of
BCCAo rats showing complete and partial degeneration of the
optic  nerves  before  and  after  the  optic  chiasm.  At  the
microscopic level, the optic tract of all animals that underwent
BCCAo showed reduced fiber density and vacuolization (Figure

Behavioral alterations
Both  sham  and  BCCAo  groups  performed  the  reversal
learning  task  in  a  similar  manner.  There  was  no  significant
difference  in  the  ability  of  the  two  groups  to  remember  the
previously  learned  discrimination  at  any  time  point  (data  not
shown).  Nor  was  there  a  difference  in  the  number  of  trials
required to reach the reversal learning acquisition criterion at
any  time  tested  (F
2,24
  =  0.6718;  ns)  (Figure  4D).  However,
regarding  the  shift  of  animals  from  an  egocentric  spatial
response  strategy  to  a  visual-cue  discrimination  strategy  to
obtain  food  reward  (set-shifting  task),  the  BCCAo  rats  were
unable  to  achieve  the  acquisition  criterion  (Figure  4C).  Twoway
ANOVA showed time effect: F
5,40
 = 6.40; P< 0.001, surgery
effect: F
3,40
 = 40.75; P< 0.01, and a significant interaction (F
5,40
=  33.87; P<  0.001).  Indeed,  after  4  weeks  of  set-shifting
training  sessions,  sham  animals  started  to  give  more  correct
than incorrect responses, and the number of correct responses
was significantly different after 6 weeks (P< 0.01). Significant
differences between groups were also observed 6 weeks after
the beginning of the set-shifting training (P< 0.01).
MRI longitudinal quantification of arteriogenesis after
BCCAo
The  temporal  pattern  of  arterial  changes  after  BCCAo  was
quantified  in  the  main  craniocerebral  arteries:  1)  the
vertebrobasilar system, including both vertebral arteries, from
its insertion at the dura mater, until the most anterior end of the
basilar artery, right at its bifurcation with the posterior cerebral
arteries; 2) the left and right middle cerebral arteries; and 3) the
azygos-pericallosal  artery,  which  corresponds  to  the
intracerebral  segment  of  the  unified  anterior  cerebral  arteries
[22].  Notably,  the  length  and  tortuosity  of  the  vertebrobasilar
system  were  strongly  altered  after  BCCAo  (Fig.  5A).  The
results of the statistical analyses (two-way ANOVA) are shown
in  Table  S1  for  each  artery.  Significant  effects  of  surgery
(BCCAo vs. sham-operation or vs. pre-occlusion data from the
same rats) were observed for both the length and tortuosity of
the vertebrobasilar artery. Compared to pre-occlusion data, a
significant  increase  in  the  vertebrobasilar  length  was  found
from  day  23  after  BCCAo  (P<  0.01)  (Fig.  5B).  Compared  to
sham-operated rats, significant differences were also found at
7 and 12 weeks after BCCAo (P< 0.01). Similar results were
observed  for  the  increase  in  vertebrobasilar  artery  tortuosity
(Fig.  5C).  However,  BCCAo  did  not  affect  the  length  or
tortuosity  of  the  middle  cerebral  and  the  azygos-pericallosal
arteries (Figure S6). These results support the notion that the
obstruction  of  blood  flow  in  the  carotid  arteries  promotes
compensatory adaptive changes in the vertebrobasilar system,
in  agreement  with  previous  reports  [6,7].  Using  MRI
arteriography, here we demonstrate that arterial changes were
already present one week after BCCAo, they persisted for at
least  12  weeks,  and  they  were  most  abundant  in  the
vertebrobasilar tree. Significant differences were not detected
in  arterial  branches  of  the  internal  carotid  tree,  although  we
cannot exclude small changes.
In addition, after BCCAo, the presence of new arteries was
detected, especially at the base of the brain (Figure 6A). The
temporal characterization of the arteriovascular area revealed a
significant effect of BCCAo versus sham-operation (or versus
pre-occlusion data) that was time-dependent two-way ANOVA,
time  effect:  F
5,40
  =  16.160; P<  0.001,  surgery  effect:  F
1,8
=
32.749; P< 0.001, and a significant interaction (F
5,40
= 16.295;
P< 0.001). Subsequent post-hoc analyses revealed significant
differences  between  the  two  experimental  groups  at  all  time
points (P< 0.01 for all cases), and between pre-occlusion data
and  certain  time  points  (10  days,  23  days,  7  weeks  and  12
weeks after BCCAo) (Figure 6B).
Structural alterations of the basilar artery 12 weeks
after BCCAo
The  post-mortem  morphometric  study  of  the  basilar  artery
(BA) 12 weeks after surgery showed a significant increase (P<
0.001)  in  vessel  (sham:  1147.25  ±  90.42  µm,  n=5;  BCCAo:
2177.8  ±  102,  n=6)  and  lumen  (sham:  942.16  ±  78.78,  n=5;
BCCAo: 1929.9 ± 92.5 n=6) diameters, which lead to a greater
(P< 0.001) cross-sectional area (CSA; Figure 7B) and a smaller
(P< 0.05) wall/lumen ratio (sham: 95.9±5.01 µm, n=5; BCCAo:
123.98±6.8  µm;  n=6).  These  changes  were  paralleled  by  an
increase (P< 0.001) in the total number of smooth muscle cells
per ring (Figure 7C). This observation suggests smooth muscle
cell  proliferation  and  is  compatible  with  circumferential  wall
stress  caused  by  artery  occlusion  [23].  Moreover,  these
changes  were  accompanied  by  a  decrease  (P<  0.05)  in
collagen I/III fluorescence intensity/µm2 in BCCAo rats (35.1 ±
6.3, n=6 vs. 97.48 ± 16.9, n=5 in sham-operated respectively).
Taken  together,  these  findings  are  compatible  with  outward
hypertrophic remodeling [24] of the BA after BCCAo. However,
differences  in  the  MCA  were  not  statistically  significant  (see
Figure S7).
Dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging for evaluation
of cerebral perfusion
Measures  of  relative  CBF  (relCBF)  (Figure  8B)  that  were
carried  out  by  dynamic  susceptibility  contrast  imaging
demonstrated that cerebral hypoperfusion was not present 12
weeks  after  BCCAo.  On  the  contrary,  a  subtle  cerebral
hyperperfusion was apparent at this time in the BCCAo group,
since  two-way  ANOVA  by  type  of  surgery  and  brain  region
showed  a  significant  effect  of  surgery  (F
54,1
=14.97; P<  0.01),
whereas  no  regional  effect  (F
54,2
=5.91;  n.s)  or  interaction
between  these  two  factors  (F
54,2
=1.82;  n.s)  was  observed
(Figure 8B). The statistical analysis for maximum gadoliniuminduced
signal enhancement, TTP, relCBV (AUC) and FWHM
are  shown  in  Table  S2.  Briefly,  significant  effects  of  BCCAo
were  demonstrated  in  various  structures  for  maximum
gadolinium-induced  signal  enhancement,  TTP  and  FWHM
(respectively Figure 8C, D and F). Taken together, our results
show that the hypoperfusion induced by BCCAo was transient
since it was no longer observed 12 weeks after surgery.
Discussion
Here  we  describe  the  dynamics  of  brain  tissue  alterations
and the phenomenon of arteriogenesis arising after BCCAo in
rats,  as  assessed  non-invasively  by  longitudinal  multimodal
MRI.  The  MRI  results  were  found  to  be  related  to  specific

observed in length and 24% of the effect observed in the tortuosity accounts for BCCA occlusion. White and black circles represent

histopathological  and  behavioral  alterations.  BCCAo  induced
variable degrees of acute ischemia in brain tissue, with some
animals  showing  clear  signs  of  acute  ischemic  damage  that
were  absent  in  other  animals.  Furthermore,  damage  ranged
from small subcortical lesions, which might have some features
resembling  lacunar  infarctions,  to  extensive  infarctions
involving  most  of  the  striatum.  This  variability  might  not  be
merely  a  feature  of  the  experimental  animal  model  since,  to
some  extent,  it  is  reminiscent  of  that  seen  in  the  clinical
evolution  of  patients  with  internal  carotid  artery  occlusion.  In
these  cases,  some  individuals  remain  asymptomatic  while
others  suffer  recurrent  transient  ischemic  attacks  (TIA)  or
various  types  of  stroke  [25].  BCCAo  in  rodents  has  been
proposed as an experimental model of vascular dementia and
small vessel disease [26,27,28] induced by progressive brain
damage.  However,  the  variability  in  acute  tissue  damage
precludes its use for studying these diseases unless animals
were  selected  in  the  acute/sub-acute  phase  with  predefined
MRI criteria, i.e. including animals with very small subcortical
lesions or with no detectable acute lesions, but excluding those
with  large  acute  infarctions.  Acute  brain  lesions  in  this
experimental model are attributable to the sharp drop in CBF
caused  by  sudden  BCCAo  [12,29].  Novel  implementations  to
the BCCAo model through the application of constrictor devices
that  induce  a  progressive  rather  than  a  sharp  drop  in  CBF
might  be  advantageous  [29],  providing  that  the  degree  and
dynamics of hypoperfusion can be standardized in the animals.
Acute  ischemic  lesions  after  BCCAo  tended  to  be  more
frequent in the right than in the left striatum. This effect might
be  attributable  to  interhemispheric  differences  in  vascular

anatomy  and/or  neuroanatomical  and  neurochemical
properties.  Several  experimental  evidences  support  the  latter
possibility. For instance, more GABA binding sites have been
reported  in  the  left  than  in  the  right  striatum  [30].  Likewise,
dopamine  D2  receptors  are  more  abundant  in  the  left
compared  to  the  right  striatum  in  adult  male  rats  [31].  In  a

rats, the inhibitory synaptic transmission was stronger in the left
than in the right striatum [32]. Therefore, it is possible that the
left  striatum  has  richer  GABAergic  activity  than  the  right
striatum in the rat. This and other functional asymmetries might
underlie a higher neuronal vulnerability to ischemia in the right
striatum  and  might  contribute  to  explain  the  tendency  for  a
higher incidence of acute infarction in the right than in the left
striatum after BCCAo in rats.
Acute brain lesions after BCCAo must be distinguished from
the alterations caused by long-lasting hypoperfusion, which is
associated  with  changes  in  the  white  matter  that  evolve  with
blood vessel rarefaction, axonal loss, myelin vacuolization and
demyelinization [33], with damage to myelin preceding that to
the  axon  [34].  More  recent  data  disclosed  the  rapid  effect  of
hypoperfusion  (3  days),  disrupting  proteins  involved  in  the
stability  of  axon-glial  connection  and  causing  damage  first  to
the paranodal septate-like junctions and later to the septate-like
junctions  [35].  White  matter  alterations  are  preceded  by
changes  in  blood  vessel  structure  and  blood-brain  barrier
(BBB) permeability [36]. The latter variations approximate BBB
alterations described in aged humans that might contribute to
small vessel disease [37,38]. The small white matter content in
rodents, together with the small size of the brain, precludes an
imaging parallelism in animals for leukoaraiosis. Nonetheless,
white  matter  lesions  in  this  experimental  animal  model  have
some  histological  features  that  may,  to  some  extent,
correspond to the radiological signs of leukoaraiosis in humans
[2].  Also,  chronic  BBB  alterations  with  accumulation  of  toxic
components of amyloid precursor protein have been described
in the perivascular space of the periventricular white matter of
rats  after  cardiac  arrest  [39].  Indeed,  we  have  demonstrated
that  DTI  has  is  able  to  either  show  the  signs  of  acute  focal
lesions (i.e. increase of AD in striatum, Figure 2) which might
reflect  the  glial  scar  formation  previously  reported  by  others
[40].  Moreover,  DTI  reflected  diffused  white  and  grey  matter
damage (i.e. decrease FA in the optic tract, decreased MD and
RD  in  the  cingulum,  Figure  2).  Our  results  strengthen  the
hypothesis  that  diffusion  weighted  imaging  techniques  are
promising tools to improve the diagnostic of neurodegenerative
diseases that present diffuse neuronal damage. In this regard,
DTI  is  a  highly  sensitive  marker  of  white  matter  damage  in
small  vessel  disease  and  has  been  proposed  as  a  potential
outcome  measure  (or  biomarker)  in  clinical  trials  for  drugs
designed  to  treat  vascular  cognitive  impairment  (VCI)  [41].
Thus, future experimental studies in animal models of vascular
dementia  by  means  of  DTI  and  cognitive  function  correlation
will  be  of  great  relevance.  In  addition,  in  our  study,  delayed
imaging  alterations  related  to  gliosis  were  identified  by  MRI
using  the  MDEFT  sequence.  Therefore,  this  sequence  might
be  useful  to  image  brain  alterations  in  chronic  experimental
models  of  neurodegenerative  diseases  that  are  accompanied
by gliosis.
One  discriminatory  symptom  between  Alzheimer’s  and  VCI
patients  is  impaired  executive  function  since  both  diseases
show memory deficits. In this regard, rodents with partial [42] or
complete  BCCAo  [29,43]  show  impaired  spatial  working
memory. Here we addressed reversal learning and set-shifting,
two components of executive function [19], in order to assess

whether  BCCAo  impaired  this  function  in  rats.  These
behavioral  animal  studies  required  tasks  involving  visual
recognition.  However,  we  show  that  BCCAo  in  rats  causes
optic nerve degeneration and visual dysfunction, in agreement
with previous observations [44,45,46]. The main arterial blood
supply to the optic nerve in the rat comes from the ophthalmic
artery, which then trifurcates into the central retinal artery and
two  posterior  ciliary  arteries  [47].  The  ophthalmic  artery  is  a
branch of the palatine artery derived from the pterygopalatine
artery,  which  is  in  turn  a  large  branch  of  the  internal  carotid
artery  [48].  Therefore,  BCCAo  in  the  rat  causes  a  strong
impairment  of  blood  supply  to  these  branches  of  the  internal
carotid artery, causing consistent optic nerve degeneration. In
agreement  with  these  findings,  visual  alterations  have  also
been  reported  in  patients  after  carotid  artery  occlusion  [49].

in the retina show degeneration and loss of retinal neurons, a
reduction  of  retinal  nerve  fibers,  an  increase  in  optic  disc
cupping,  retinal  vascular  tortuosity  and  thinning,  and  visual
functional  impairment  [50].  All  together,  these  observations
suggest  that  optic  nerve  and  retinal  degeneration  following
vascular  pathology  might  be  useful  to  study  the  mechanisms
underlying  neuronal  degeneration  associated  with  dementia.
Although  visual  dysfunction  may  be  part  of  the
neurodegenerative  disorder,  assessing  cognitive  function  in
animals with tests involving visually cued tasks may not be fully
conclusive since visual alterations in the absence of memory or
executive function alterations cannot be excluded. Indeed, our
results show that that animals subjected to BCCAo “remember”
the position of the levers in the box and preserve the capacity
to  properly  perform  the  spatial-response  tasks.  However,
BCCAo  rats  showed  worst  performance  than  the  shamoperated
group when visual cues were required to perform the
executive function learning task. This effect was related to the
observed  optic  nerve  degeneration,  which  impaired  visual
function. Importantly, this result questions the validity of some
behavioral  studies  using  this  experimental  model  [51,52,53],
since  BCCAo  rats  may  not  correctly  perform  visually  cued
tasks,  such  as  the  Morris  water  maze.  To  overcome  this
technical issue, Kalesnykas and colleagues [54] proposed the
use  of  non-visual  learning  paradigms  to  test  memory
dysfunction after BCCAo in rodents.
BCCAo  also  triggered  a  progressive  process  of  vascular
remodeling,  causing  potent  arteriogenesis  in  the
vertebrobasilar  tree  that  was  already  detected  at  day  7  and
increased until the end of the study (12 weeks). Here we used
a  new  non-invasive  quantitative  method  to  assess  the
progression  of  morphological  alterations  of  the  main  cerebral
arteries in living animals. These vascular alterations in arteries
that  are  not  directly  affected  by  the  occlusion  could  be
attributable to the recovery of blood flow that we observed 12
weeks after BCCAo and that may take place even earlier [55].
Recovery  from  the  induced  hypoperfusion  is  compatible  with
compensatory adaptive changes triggered by arteriogenesis, in
agreement with previous findings [6,7,13]. Structural changes
in the basilar artery included an increase in the cross-sectional
area,  and  they  are  globally  compatible  with  outward
hypertrophic  remodeling,  which  is  caused  mainly  by  smooth
muscle hyperplasia. In contrast, in the middle cerebral artery,
which  is  affected  by  hypoperfusion,  BCCAo  induces
hypotrophic  remodeling  by  a  mechanism  that  involves  a
reduction of collagen I/III in association with increased MMP-1
and MMP-9 and consequent decrease in myogenic tone [51].
Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  vascular  changes  seen  in
branches of the occluded vessels differ from those occurring in
other  vascular  trees.  The  mechanisms  involved  in  BCCAoinduced
brain arteriogenesis are not fully understood, and the
contribution  of  tissue  ischemia  to  this  process  is  not  known.
Notably, the phenomenon of vertebrobasilar arteriogenesis was
homogeneous across animals, in strong contrast to the variable
degree  of  acute  ischemic  damage,  and  this  process  was  not
detected  in  hypoperfused  branches  of  the  internal  carotid
artery.  These  findings  are  in  agreement  with  the  notion
acquired in other vascular beds that, contrarily to angiogenesis,
arteriogenesis is not induced by ischemia but results from the
increased fluid shear stress derived from vessel occlusion [23].
Among  the  molecular  determinants  of  arteriogenesis,
expression  of  growth  factors,  adhesion  molecules  and
chemokines,  such  as  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1,  in
vascular smooth muscle cells have been identified as a critical
factor  for  the  initiation  of  arteriogenesis  [56,57,58],  together
with  monocyte  recruitment  to  the  arteries  [59].  These  effects
promote vascular remodeling and are thought to be beneficial
by  restoring  blood  flow  after  arterial  occlusion  [60].
Understanding  the  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  this
process may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies
to improve blood flow after chronic hypoperfusion.
In  conclusion,  our  multimodal  and  longitudinal  imaging
approach  to  characterize  the  BCCAo  model  demonstrated in
vivo a variable degree of acute ischemic lesions and delayed
subcortical  neurodegeneration,  and  also  consistent  white
matter  degeneration  and  arteriogenesis.  We  show  that  the
BCCAo  model  is  suitable  for  studying  progressive  brain
degeneration  caused  by  insufficient  blood  supply,  taking  into
account  that  visually  cued  behavioral  tasks  might  not  be
performed in correlation as a result of optic tract degeneration.
In  addition,  we  provide  a  new  analytical  method  to  assess
physical  alterations  in  main  cerebral  arteries in  vivo.  This
approach  could  be  used  to  monitor  the  development  of
structural  cerebrovascular  abnormalities  and  the  effect  of
treatments that seek to facilitate vascular adaptive responses
to chronic brain hypoperfusion.
