Available online 8 December 2011
A pivotal role of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) on neuronal apoptosis has been demonstrated
in a rodent stroke model. MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is an archetypal member of
the dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP) family, which inactivates mitogenactivated
protein kinase (MAPK) including JNK through dephosphorylation. MKP-1, one of
immediate early genes in stress conditions, was induced at transcriptional level in hypoxia
/re-oxygenation (H/R) in neuroblastoma N1E115 cells, however the activation of JNK was
not suppressed in the acute phase of re-oxygenation. Small interference RNA-mediated
knock-down ofMKP-1enhanced phospho-JNK and neuronal death that is rescued by JNK inhibitor
in H/R. Conversely, conditional over-expression of MKP-1 suppressed phospho-JNK,
the expression of proapoptotic genes, and neuronal death in H/R. Further the immunoreactivity
of MKP-1 was detected in the neurons and partially co-localized with that of phospho-
JNK in the surrounding zone of ischemia in rat MCA-O (middle cerebral artery occlusion) reperfusion
model. These findings indicate that over-expression of MKP-1 could suppress
neuronal death possibly through regulating JNK signaling in vitro and be a prominent neuroprotective
target for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and one of the leading
causes of adult disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke accounts
for 60–80% of the total (Donnan et al., 2008; Legos et al., 2002).
At present, intravenous administration of recombinant tissueplasminogen
activator (rt-PA) is the only approved therapy to
improve outcomes of acute ischemic stroke patients. However,
this application has been approved only in the first 3–4.5 h
after the onset of symptoms because of the possible risk of
bleeding (Hacke et al., 2004; Lansberg et al., 2009). Therefore,
novel neuroprotective therapies have been expected to treat
stroke patients in the acute or sub-acute phase after the onset.
Although necrosis is more dominant in neuronal death in the
central lesion (core) of the ischemic brain, apoptosis occurs particularly
within the peri-ischemic area (penumbra) in a rodent
focal ischemic model and human stroke (Charriaut-Marlangue
et al., 1996; Garcia et al., 1995; Li et al., 1995; Linnik et al.,

1993; Lipton, 1999; Smith, 2004). Cumulative evidence from the
experiments using JNK knockout mice or JNK inhibitor revealed a
pivotal role of JNK in neuronal apoptosis and a benefit of the inhibitor
in focal stroke model (Guan et al., 2006; Okuno et al.,
2004; Pirianov et al., 2007).
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are inactivated
by a family of dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DUSPs)
that differ in their substrate specificity, tissue distribution, inducibility
by extracellular stimuli, and cellular localization.
MKP-1, an archetypal member of the family, has broad substrate
specificity toward p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and stressactivated
protein kinase/JNK (Owens and Keyse, 2007; Sun et
al., 1993). MKP-1 knockout mice have an exacerbated response
to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with elevated cytokine levels in
serum and prolonged activation of p38 and JNK in macrophages
, suggesting that MKP-1 preferentially inactivates p38
and JNK in vivo (Wang et al., 2007). Recent reports showed expression
of MKP-1 is increased in the hippocampal regions of
major depressive disorder patients (Duric et al., 2010) and that
MKP-1 regulates BDNF-induced axon branching (Jeanneteau et
al., 2010), indicating the critical roles of MKP-1 in the nervous
system. However, the role of MKP-1 and the regulatory mechanism
of activated JNK in brain stroke remain poorly understood.
In the present study, we investigated the mechanism in
which neuronal cells respond to H/R and found that MKP-1
could play a critical role on neuronal death through regulating
JNK signaling in brain ischemia/reperfusion.
2. Results
2.1. MKP-1 and JNK cascade are induced in H/R in
neuroblastoma N1E115 cells and primary cultured neurons
To elucidate the mechanism underlying neuronal response to
H/R, we performed a differential display analysis to identify H/
R-induced genes in neuron as previously described
(Yamaguchi et al., 1999, 2002). MKP-1was one of the genes induced
in H/R. Since JNK, one of the substrates for MKP-1, plays
a pivotal role in neuronal apoptosis in rodent stroke model
(Kuan et al., 2003; Pirianov et al., 2007), we focused on the
functional interaction between JNK and MKP-1 in H/R. First,
to assess the temporal profile of MKP-1 mRNA expression in
H/R, we performed a real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis in neuroblastoma N1E115 cells that were
allowed to experience neural differentiation by serum starvation
prior to H/R (Fig. 1A). MKP-1 mRNA expression was
induced 2–3 folds in H/R compared with control (normoxia)
(C versus R1, p=0.000107, n=3). Although MKP-1 is induced at
transcriptional level in H/R, MKP-1 protein levels were not

increased at 1 h and 2 h after re-oxygenation (C versus R1 or
R2, p=0.1022 or 0.2228 respectively, n=6) (Fig. 1B, middle)
and the phosphorylation of JNK (activated JNK) was not suppressed
at this time points (C versus R1 or R2, p=0.049 or
0.0441 respectively, n=6) (Fig. 1B, bottom). We then tested
whether JNK inhibitor SP600125 or caspase inhibitors (DEVDCHO
, z-VAD-fmk) suppress neuronal death using lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with
SP600125 or caspase inhibitors suppressed the LDH release
in H/R compared with control, indicating that JNK signaling
and caspases are implicated in neuronal death in this experimental
system (Cont versus SP600125, DEVD or z-VAD,
p=0.0014, 2.43E-09 or 2.06E-17 respectively, n=12).
To strengthen the results in N1E115 cells, we performed assays
using rat primary cultured cortex neurons. We first investigated
whether MKP-1 mRNA levels and JNK cascade
were induced in this H/R model by real-time PCR and western
blot analysis.MKP-1mRNA expression was induced 6.8 fold at
1 h after re-oxygenation compared with control (normoxia) (C
versus R1, p=0.0076, n=6) (Fig. 2A), however MKP-1 protein
levels were not increased (C versus R1 or R2, p=0.1956 or
0.2648 respectively, n=4) (Fig. 2B, middle). In addition, activation
of JNK (phospho-JNK) was not suppressed at 1 h and 2 h
after re-oxygenation (C versus R1 or R2, p=0.0083 or 0.0025 respectively
, n=4) (Fig. 2B, bottom). Pretreatment with SP600125
or caspase inhibitors suppressed the LDH release in H/R
compared with control (Cont versus SP600125, DEVD or z-
VAD, p=0.0053, 0.010 or 0.0016 respectively, n=12) (Fig. 2C).
These results in primary cultured neurons are consistent
with those in N1E115 cells.
2.2. MKP-1 is induced in the brain of rat MCA-O
reperfusion model
We investigated whether MKP-1 and JNK pathways are implicated
in brain ischemia/reperfusion using rat MCA-O reperfusion
(MCAO-R) model. Real-time PCR assay using RNA from
ipsilateral brain hemisphere showed a rapid induction at 1 h
and 2 h after reperfusion (C versus R1 or R2, p=0.000026 or
0.0046 respectively, n=3) (Fig. 3A). This trend is similar to
that of c-fos, which is induced in rodent focal stroke model
(Cho et al., 2001). We then performed western blot analysis
using brain homogenates from sham-operated or MCAO-R
(1 h after reperfusion) hemisphere (Fig. 3B, top). MKP-1 expression
was also induced at protein level at 1 h after reperfusion
in MCAO-R brain (Sham versus MCAO-R, p=0.025,
n=5) (Fig. 3B, middle), however the activation of JNK was
not suppressed at this time point [Sham versus MCAO-R,
p=0.042 (46 kD p-JNK) or p=0.035 (54 kD p-JNK) respectively,
n=5] (Fig. 3B, bottom). The immunoreactivity of MKP-1 was
co-localized partially with that of phospho-JNK and with
that of neuronal marker NeuN in the bordering zone around

ischemic core, indicating MKP-1 could be implicated in the
stress response of ischemic neurons (Fig. 3C). No immunoreactivity
of phospho-JNK was observed in the corresponding
region on the contralateral side.
2.3. Effect of conditional over-expression or small
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock-down of MKP-1
in neuroblastoma N1E115 cells
We then investigated the direct effect of MKP-1 on phospho-
JNK and neuronal death in NIE115 cells. First we performed
siRNA-mediated knock-down of MKP-1. MKP-1 siRNA accelerated
the activation of the phospho-JNK 1.5 fold compared
with controls in H/R by western blot analysis (Cont siRNA versus MKP-1 siRNA, p=0.000497, n=3) (Fig. 4A). LDH release
assay showed that MKP-1 siRNA significantly increased neuronal
death in H/R compared with the control, which is abolished
by SP600125 (Cont siRNA versus MKP-1 siRNA,
p=0.0103, n=24) (Fig. 4B). MKP-1 siRNA also significantly increased
apoptotic cell death in H/R compared with the control
by Hoechst 33342 staining (Cont siRNA versus MKP-1 siRNA,
p=0.0402, n=3) (Fig. 4C). Then to examine the effect of MKP-1
over-expression, tetracycline-inducible expression (Tet-On)
lines were established in neuroblastoma N1E115. These lines
over-express HA-tagged MKP-1 on the application of tetracycline
(1μg/ml). The N1E115 cells, allowed to experience neural
differentiation by serum starvation, were applied with tetracycline
or mock and exposed to H/R. The N1E115 cells overexpressed
MKP-1 protein approximately 3–4 folds in total
compared with the control [C(tet−) versus C(tet+) or H/R(tet−)
versus H/R(tet+), p=0.0471 or 0.02144 respectively, n=5]
(Fig. 4D). MKP-1 over-expression suppressed the phosphorylation
of JNK in H/R [H/R(tet−) versus H/R(tet+), p=0.0336, n=3]
(Fig. 4D). LDH release assay showed that MKP-1 overexpression
as well as the pretreatment with SP600125 suppresses
the neuronal death in H/R [DMSO(tet−) versus
SP600125(tet−) or DMSO(tet+),p=0.0097 or 0.0105 respectively,
n=12] (Fig. 4E). Various proapoptotic genes, including Bim,
DP5, and FasL are induced downstream of JNK signaling in
neuronal cells under stress conditions (Kristiansen et al.,
2010). MKP-1 over-expression partially inhibited the induction
of proapoptotic genes includingBim,DP5andFasLin H/R compared
with controls (Fig. 4F), which is consistent with the previous
report that MKP-1 over-expression suppresses these
proapoptotic genes in the NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis
of sympathetic neurons (Kristiansen et al., 2010).
3. Discussion
The present study showed that MKP-1 was induced at transcriptional
level in H/R in neuronal differentiated N1E115
cells and primary cultured neurons. However, the activation
of JNK was not suppressed in the acute phase of reoxygenation.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MKP-1increased
the activation of JNK and neuronal death in H/R in N1E115
cells. Further, neuronal death induced byMKP-1siRNA is abolished
by JNK inhibitor in H/R. Conversely, conditional overexpression
of MKP-1 suppressed phospho-JNK and neuronal
death in H/R.
MKP-1, one of immediate early genes, is rapidly induced in
various stress conditions (Kim et al., 2005; Owens and Keyse,
2007; Xu et al., 2004). The expression and activity of MKP-1
are tightly regulated (Zhou et al., 2006). MKP-1 is induced at
transcriptional level through Jak2, p44/42 MAPK, and p53
(Hamdi et al., 2005; Sandberg et al., 2004). MKP-1 mRNA stabilization
and translation are regulated by RNA-binding proteins
such as HuR and NF90 in HeLa cells (Kuwano et al.,
2008). In addition, MKP-1 protein is phosphorylated by p44/
42 MAPK in its carboxy-terminal region, inhibiting MKP-1
degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
(Brondello et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2003). Thus, whether MKP-1
is induced at translational or post-translational level would
be dependent on the cellular context including cell types,
stress conditions, and experimental conditions. In the present
study, MKP-1 was induced 2–3 folds in H/R at transcriptional
level, however MKP-1 protein levels were not
increased in N1E115 cells. Since global protein synthesis is
suppressed in stress condition (Liu and Simon, 2004), translational
induction of MKP-1 would be repressed despite the
transcriptional up-regulation in H/R. In the conditional overexpression
state, the protein levels of MKP-1 were upregulated
approximately 3–4 folds compared with control,
leading to the partial inhibition of JNK phosphorylation.
These findings raise the possibility the induction levels or
its activity of MKP-1 are not enough to suppress JNK activation
in NIE115 cells in H/R. In addition, MKP-1 activity in H/R could
be regulated through unknown modifications, including
acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation. In fact,
MKP-1 protein stability through phosphorylation at Serine 359 is
critical for regulating its phosphatase activity (Brondello et al.,
1999). Such a complex regulatory mechanism of MKP-1 activity
and stabilization in stress condition remains to be clarified in
the present study.
In contrast to the results in in vitro H/R model using N1E115
cells and primary cultured neurons, MKP-1 is induced at protein
level in the brain of rat MCAO-R model. One simple explanation
for this discrepancy is; brain lysates for western blot analysis
consist of not only neurons but also non-neuronal cells, including
glial cells. It is well known that astrocytes have a higher antioxidant
potential in comparison to neurons (Lucius and
Sievers, 1996; Raps et al., 1989). Therefore MKP-1 protein expression
could be induced in non-neuronal cells in reperfusion state
of MCAO-R model, which might enhance the capability of nonneuronal
cells to adapt to oxidative stress.
Neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra is considered to be a
promising target for the treatment in acute cerebral infarction,
in which the complex signaling pathways are implicated
(Mehta et al., 2007; Nakka et al., 2008). Previous studies showed
that the neural-specific JNK3 isoform exclusively contributes
to ischemic apoptosis in focal stroke model (Kuan et al., 2003;
Pirianov et al., 2007). In the present study, MKP-1 overexpression
repressed the JNK phosphorylation and neuronal
death in H/R, raising the possibility that MKP-1 overexpression
could suppress neuronal death in penumbra
through regulating JNK activity. However, whether MKP-1
over-expression inactivates especially JNK3 isoform or all JNK
isoforms in H/R remains unclear. Both caspase-dependent
and -independent signaling pathways could contribute to neuronal
apoptosis in the penumbra following adult rodent MCA-

O(Ferrer et al., 2003; Nakka et al., 2008). Recently, necroptosis,
an alternative form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death, was
also proposed as a potential therapeutic target for brain ischemia
(Degterev et al., 2005). In addition, the basal functions of
JNK are critical for neural activities including differentiation
and plasticity (Waetzig et al., 2006), suggesting complete
block of JNK cascade could deteriorate the basal functions. Although
it is unclear whether MKP-1 over-expression inactivates
all JNK isoforms, the inhibition of all JNK isoforms
could negate the beneficial effects of MKP-1 on neuronal
death in H/R.
Recent reports showed increased expression of hippocampal
MKP-1 in the major depressive disorder patients has negative
effects on neurons through disrupting the MAPK
pathways such as ERK (Duric et al., 2010). We found that
MKP-1 over-expression in N1E115 cells also suppress the activation
of ERK as well as JNK in H/R (data not shown). Therefore
it is possible that sustained activation of MKP-1 could
cancel its survival effect of acute phase thorough disrupting
ERK-mediated survival cascades in stroke brain.
In summary, the present study indicates that overexpression
of MKP-1 could suppress neuronal death possibly
through regulating JNK signalingin vitroand be a promising target
for neuroprotective treatment strategy for acute ischemic
stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that
over-expression or inhibition of MKP-1 could regulate neuronal
death in H/R through modulating JNK signaling cascade.
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. Animals with focal ischemia
Unilateral MCA-O (middle cerebral artery occlusion) was performed
in male Wistar rats (250–300 g) as described previously
with minor modification (Longa et al., 1989). Briefly, rats were
deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-
Tribromoethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd, Japan)
(240 mg/kg). The external carotid and common carotid arteries
were ligated. A 4–0 monofilament nylon suture with rounded
tip and coated with poly-L-lysine was inserted up to 17 mm
through the internal carotid artery. After 1 h occlusion,
reperfusion was initiated by suture withdrawal. A similar
procedure was performed in the sham-operated group except
for the suture occlusion and reperfusion.The bodytemperature
was controlled during the operation byheating pad.The animal
care and use protocol (#A21-131) was approved by the Chiba
University Animal Care and Use Committee.
4.2. TTC staining
Coronal brain sections were cut in a thickness of 2 mm and
immersed in 2% solution of 2,3,7-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for 15 min at 37 °C. The normal
tissue stains red and infarct tissue appears white.
4.3. Cell culture and hypoxia/re-oxygenation
Neuroblastoma N1E115 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
2
and 95% room air. N1E115 cells were allowed to experience
neural differentiation by serum starvation (DMEM with 2%
FBS) as previously described (Tanaka et al., 2002). In hypoxia/
re-oxygenation (H/R) assay, N1E115 cells were subjected to
serum starvation for 5 h (12 h for tet-on inducible system),
and placed in hypoxia chamber which maintained low oxygen
tension (pO2, <10 Torr) for 14 h (24 h for LDH assays) as described
previously (Matsuo et al., 1997; Yamaguchi et al.,
1999). Where indicated, after exposure to hypoxia cultures
were returned to the ambient atmosphere (re-oxygenation)
for the indicated time. In experiments with reagents, cells
were pretreated with 9μM (2 μg/ml) JNK inhibitor SP600125
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan), 10μM MEK inhibitor
U0126 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan),
10μM inhibitor of caspase-3/7N-Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO
(Ac-DEVD-CHO) (Peptide Institute, Inc., Japan), 10μM pancaspase
inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-
fmk) (Peptide Institute, Inc., Japan) or vehicle (DMSO) for
30 min before (pre-treatment) or after (post-treatment) exposing
to hypoxia as indicated.
Cortex neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 Wistar
rat embryos, as described previously (Yamaguchi et al.,
2002). Briefly, fetal cortex were dissected and digested with
0.25% trypsin for 20 min at room temperature in calcium/
magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tissues
were further dissociated by repeated trituration. The cells
were seeded at a density of 1×106cells/cm2 on plates coated
with poly-L-lysine (10μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and grown
in DMEM containing B27 supplement (GIBCO, cat # 17504044)
and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
2
and 95% room air. All
experiments were performed in 8 day-old cultures (8 DIV).
4.4. Assessment of cell viability
Cell viability was assessed by determining the release of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium thereby
indicating a loss of membrane integrity and cell death. LDH
activity was measured using a commercial kit (Roche) in
which a colorimetric assay measures the pyruvate-mediated
conversion of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine into a visible hydrazone
precipitate. % LDH release was expressed as (experimental
value/maximum release)×100, where the maximum
release was obtained after exposure of untreated control cultures
to detergent (1% TritonX-100) for 15 min at 37 °C.
4.5. Western blot analysis
Cell extracts or brain homogenates for western blot analysis
were prepared by lysing them in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics
)]. The samples were boiled for 5 min before subjecting
30μg aliquots to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels.
After the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), the membrane was
incubated in blocking buffer [phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% nonfat
dried milk] for 1 h at room temperature and then probed
143 BRAIN  RESEARCH  1436  (2012)  137– 146
(EVALUATION PDF Extractor SDK 8.0.0.2542.2083820539)
with a primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.
The membrane was washed three times in PBS-T, probed
with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antimouse
or -rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Biotechnologies
) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and
washed again in PBS-T. Detection of signal was performed
with ECL chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare Ltd).
The primary antibodies used were anti-MKP-1 (sc-1199)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti phospho-JNK (#4668) (Cell
Signaling Technologies), anti-JNK (#9258) (Cell Signaling
Technologies), anti-phospho-c-Jun (ser63) (# 9261) (Cell Signaling
Technologies), anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175)
(#9661) (Cell Signaling Technologies) and anti-alpha-tubulin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies).
4.6. Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and GenE-
lute mRNA miniprep Kits (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) according to
the manufacturers' instructions. RNA (1μg) was reverse transcribed
to produce cDNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was
performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). All real-time PCR assays were performed in triplicate
using a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems
) as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles
at 95 °C for 20 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. Primers for Bim, DP5,
FasL, GAPDH, MKP-1 were described previously (Engelbrecht
et al., 2003; Gurzov et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2004; Xiong et
al., 2009). For standardization of relative mRNA expression,
GAPDH primers were used. The results of cycle threshold
values (Ct values) were calculated by the ΔΔCt method to obtain
the fold differences.
4.7. Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min
and then washed by PBS three times. Cells were permeabilized
and non-specific sites were blocked by incubating with
blocking solution [PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and 3% goat serum]. The cells
were incubated with antibodies diluted in a blocking solution
overnight at 4 °C. Then, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated
with Alexa488 or Alexa568 conjugated secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Then slides
were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole) and
mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation
). Images were obtained using fluorescence microscopy
(Nikon, E600).
4.8. Immunohistochemistry
The rats were intracardially perfused with 4% PFA. Brains
were harvested and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C,
followed by sucrose replacement. Brains were embedded in
Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound on a metal
block in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen sections
were cut in 20μm-thick sections with a cryocut (Microm HM
500 OM, Walldorf, Germany). Antigen retrieval was performed
by microwave-heated incubation in citrate buffer (10 mM
Citric Acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min, followed by incubation with antibodies
diluted in a blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Then,
the slides were washed in PBS and incubated with Alexa488 or
Alexa568 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h
at room temperature. Slides were mounted with a fluorescent
mounting medium (DakoCytomation). Images were obtained
using fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, E600). The primary antibodies
used were anti-MKP-1 (Sigma-Aldrich), antiphospho-JNK
(#sc-6254) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CA,
USA), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Promega) and anti-NeuN antibody
(Chemicon).
4.9. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) assay
siRNA targeting MKP-1 (sc-35938) was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies. A non-targeting control siRNA (sc-
37007) was used as a negative control. Transfection of siRNA
at 40 nM of final concentration was performed by Lipofectamine™2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacture's protocol.
4.10. Tetracycline-inducible expression system
Tetracycline-inducible MKP-1 over-expressing cells were
established by T-Rex System (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, N-terminal HA-tagged
mouse MKP-1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA4/TO plasmid
(pcDNA4/TO-HA-MKP-1). N1E115 cells were co-transfected
with pcDNA4/TO-HA-MKP-1 and pcDNA6/TR and then selected
by cultivation in 100μg/ml blastcidine S and 100μg/ml Zeocin
(Invitrogen). Four cell lines that induce HA-MKP-1
expression with 1μg/ml tetracycline were established, and
two lines were used in the experiments.
4.11. Hoechst33342 staining and apoptotic cell death assay
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature,
washed by PBS, stained with Hoechst 33342 (5μg/ml) (Sigma-
Aldrich Co.) for 20 min at room temperature, and then stored
at 4 °C until quantification by fluorescence microscopy. Cells
harboring nuclear condensation or fragmentation were
counted as apoptotic cell death. Three dishes were used per
experimental group, with at least 200 cells in four random
fields being counted on each trial. Each experiment was repeated
in biological duplicate.
4.12. Densitometry analysis
Densitometry was determined with ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health) with normalization to the corresponding
controls (Tubulin or total JNK).
4.13. Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were analyzed with analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's post hoc test or Fisher's PLSD
between individual groups. Values of p<0.05 were considered
significant. Data were expressed as means±S.E. or ±S.D. as indicated.
Where indicated, data sets were analyzed by the Student's t-test, with p-values less than 0.05 considered as
statistically significant.
