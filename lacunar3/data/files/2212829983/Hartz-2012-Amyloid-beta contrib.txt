Transgenic Human Amyloid Precursor Protein Mice and in
Humans With Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy

Background and Purpose—Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a degenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-
(A) deposition in the blood–brain barrier (BBB). CAA contributes to injuries of the neurovasculature including lobar
hemorrhages, cortical microbleeds, ischemia, and superficial hemosiderosis. We postulate that CAA pathology is
partially due to A compromising the BBB.
Methods—We characterized 19 patients with acute stroke with “probable CAA” for neurovascular pathology based on
MRI and clinical findings. Also, we studied the effect of A on the expression of tight junction proteins and matrix
metalloproteases (MMPs) in isolated rat brain microvessels.
Results—Two of 19 patients with CAA had asymptomatic BBB leakage and posterior reversible encephalopathic
syndrome indicating increased BBB permeability. In addition to white matter changes, diffusion abnormality suggesting
lacunar ischemia was found in 4 of 19 patients with CAA; superficial hemosiderosis was observed in 7 of 9 patients.
A

decreased expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5 and increased expression of MMP-2
and MMP-9. Analysis of brain microvessels from transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein
revealed the same expression pattern for tight junction and MMP proteins. Consistent with reduced tight junction and
increased MMP expression and activity, permeability was increased in brain microvessels from human amyloid
precursor protein mice compared with microvessels from wild-type controls.
Conclusions—Our findings indicate that A contributes to changes in brain microvessel tight junction and MMP expression,
which compromises BBB integrity. We conclude that A causes BBB leakage and that assessing BBB permeability could
potentially help characterize CAA progression and be a surrogate marker for treatment response. (Stroke. 2012;43:514-523.)
Key Words: amyloid-  blood–brain barrier  cerebral amyloid angiopathy  neuroimaging
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a degenerative
neurovascular disease that affects most patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and approximately 30% of elderly
people.1 The main characteristic of CAA is deposition of
amyloid- (A) proteins in leptomeningeal and cortical
blood vessels in the brain that contribute to cortical cerebral
brain hemorrhage. Because CAA is a disease of the elderly, it
overlaps with a variety of cardiovascular risk factors (eg,
hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia) that could contribute
to CAA pathology, in particular white matter lesions.2,3 Recent findings suggest that elevated levels of 2
transcription factors, serum response factor and myocardin,
contribute to CAA phenotype. Both serum response factor
and myocardin regulate differentiation of mural vascular cells
in response to hypoxia and lead to the development of CAA
and hypercontractile arterial phenotype with brain hypoperfusion
in patients with AD and mouse models, thus aggravating
white matter lesions.3,4 Cortical cerebral brain hemorrhage
is the main criterion for CAA diagnosis and causes
and/or contributes to neurodegeneration with dementia and
cognitive impairment that overlaps with AD. However, CAA
also exhibits acute phases with neurovascular injury that
show symptoms ranging from headache, weakness, sensory
loss, visual changes, or speech problems.2
CAA is diagnosed according to the Boston criteria that
distinguish 4 categories.5 Diagnoses of “definite CAA” and
“probable CAA with supporting pathological evidence” require
histopathologic evidence from postmortem tissue or
evidence of amyloid deposition in pathological tissue in
addition to clinical criteria. Diagnosis of “probable CAA”

requires clinical and radiological evidence showing at least 2
lobar hemorrhagic lesions due to CAA. The same criteria
apply to “possible CAA,” but radiological evidence of only 1
hemorrhage is required.
A reliable CAA diagnosis solely based on neurological
signs and cognition is difficult. However, MRI with gradientecho
sequences now allows detection of small cortical and
subcortical hemorrhages and thus, diagnosis of different CAA
phenotypes including hemosiderosis (SH), acute cerebral
ischemia, and superficial and posterior reversible encephalopathic
syndrome (PRES). For the diagnosis of the latter,
diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery imaging (FLAIR)6–9 are required.
In the present study, we used MRI to classify CAA in 19
patients who were admitted to our stroke unit with acute
stroke symptoms, and phenotyped these patients with CAA
based on symptoms of neurovascular damage, that is, blood–
brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Recent evidence suggests that
BBB leakage observed in patients with CAA is, at least in
part, due to Aaccumulation in cerebral microvessels.10,11To
test this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments in
which we exposed isolated rat brain microvessels to human
A
40
and determined the effect of A on proteins of the tight
junction (TJ) complex and on matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)
that are responsible for degradation of the microvessel basal
membrane. We also measured barrier integrity in isolated brain
microvessels from 9-month-old transgenic human amyloid precursor
protein (hAPP)-overexpressing mice (Tg2576) that are a
well-established CAA animal model.12,13
Methods
Animals
Animal protocols were approved by the University of Minnesota
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance
with Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care International regulations and the US Department of
Agriculture Animal Welfare Act. Male CD IGS Sprague-Dawley rats
(275–300 g) were from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).
Male transgenic hAPP mice (Tg2576 strain, 129S6.Cg-Tg[APPSWE]
2576Kha) and wild-type mice from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY)
were 9 months old at the time of the experiments. Animals were housed
under controlled conditions (23°C, 35% relative humidity, 12-hour
dark/light cycle) with free access to water and food.
Chemicals
ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-5 antibodies were from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA). MMP-2, MMP-9,-actin antibodies, and MMP-9
protein were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Human A40 was from
EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ).
Brain Microvessel Isolation
Brain microvessels were isolated as described previously.14,15 Animals
were euthanized with CO
2
and decapitated. Brains were
removed, dissected, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline.
Ficoll (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was added to a final concentration of
15% and the homogenate was centrifuged (5800 g, 20 minutes, 4°C).
After resuspending the pellet in 1% bovine serum albumin, the
suspension was passed over a glass bead column. Microvessels were
collected in 1% bovine serum albumin, washed with phosphatebuffered
saline, and used for experiments.
Brain Microvessel Membrane Isolation
Brain microvessels were homogenized in lysis buffer (Sigma) containing
Complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).14,15
Samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g (15 minutes, 4°C) and the
resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100 000 g (90 minutes, 4°C).
Brain microvessel membranes were resuspended and stored at80°C.
Western Blotting
Brain microvessel membranes were analyzed by Western blotting as
described previously.14,16 Western blots were performed with the
Invitrogen NuPage Bis-Tris electrophoresis/blotting system (Invitrogen
, Carlsbad, CA). After protein transfer, membranes were blocked
and incubated with primary antibody. Membranes were washed and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ImmunoPure secondary
IgG (1:15 000; Pierce, Rockford, IL). Proteins were detected
with SuperSignal West Pico Chemoluminescent Substrate (Pierce)
and visualized using a BioRad Gel Doc 2000system (BioRad,
Hercules, CA). Western blots were quantitated by densitometric
analysis using QuantityOne 1-D Version 4.6.5 software (BioRad
Laboratories). Data were normalized to -actin loading controls.
Texas Red Efflux
Microvessels were transferred to glass cover slips and loaded with
2 mol/L Texas red (sulforhodamin101-free acid, 1 hour, 25°C).
After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, Texas red efflux from
microvessels was monitored with confocal microscopy (Nikon C1,
Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope, 40 oil objective, NA 1.3, 543
nm HeNe laser; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Mannitol
(100 mmol/L) was used as a positive control for barrier opening and
maximum permeability marker. For each treatment, 7 confocal
images were acquired and luminal fluorescence was measured using
Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).17 First-order
Texas red efflux rate constants were calculated by nonlinear regression
(Prism 4; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Zymography
Brain capillary lysate was incubated with Gelatin Sepharose 4B (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 90 minutes. After centrifugation
(500 g, 2 minutes) and washing with phosphate-buffered saline/
Tween20, MMPs were eluted with Novex Tris-Glycine SDS sample
buffer (1). The eluate was loaded on Novex 10% Zymogram
gelatin gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electrophoresis was
performed. Gels were stained with BioRad Coomassie Brilliant Blue
R-250 staining solution and clear bands indicating protease activity
were visualized using a BioRad Gel Doc 2000 system (BioRad,
Hercules, CA). Band intensity representing MMP activity was
determined by densitometric analysis.
Patient Selection and Phenotyping
Our patient study (study period: June 2010 to March 2011) was
approved by the University of Regensburg ethics committee according
to the declarations of Helsinki (1995) and Tokyo (1998). All
patients admitted to the study were identified in the Stroke Unit of
the Bezirksklinikum Regensburg, University of Regensburg, Germany
, and underwent routine cerebral CT. Patients presented with
atypical intracerebral hemorrhage or SH with symptoms attributed to
either direct brain damage or secondary symptoms such as focal
epileptic seizures. Patients 55 years with atypical or multiple
hemorrhages were screened for CAA. Risk factors for white matter
disease, particularly hypertension and diabetes, were documented
and classified.18
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI was performed using a 1.5-T MR system (Siemens Symphony,
Erlangen, Germany). The following MR sequences were applied:
axial T2, T1, FLAIR (repetition time 7530, inversion time 2300,
echo time 110), diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion
coefficient, high-resolution sagittal magnetization prepared rapid
gradient echo-T1 (MPRAGE-T1), time-of-flight MR angiography,
and axial T2* fast low-angle shot sequences (FLASH). The MRI

sequences had 21 slices of 5-mm thickness and an interslice gap of
1 mm with an in-plane voxel size of 11 and field of view of
250 mm. Sequence details included: axial T2* FLASH800, echo

repetition time7530 ms, inversion time2300 ms, and flip angle180°; diffusion-weighted imaging repetition time4900 ms,
echo time108 ms, b-value1000 and flip angle90°” T1 pre-/
postcontrast repetition time511 ms, echo time12 ms, and flip
angle90°. Additional sequences included venous time-of-flight
MR angiography and postcontrast MRI (0.01 mmol/kg, Magnevist;
Schering, Berlin, Germany) and were applied in cases of contrast
agent contraindications or when considered appropriate by the
neuroradiologist.
The following criteria were used for MRI image analysis. Using a
single reader (F.S.) from FLAIR sequences, white matter changes
(WMCs) were categorized into 3 classes according to Verdelho et
al19: “mild” WMCs were defined as single lesions10 mm and/or
areas of grouped lesions20 mm in diameter; “moderate” WMCs
were defined as single lesions between 10 and 20 mm and/or areas
of grouped lesions 20 mm in diameter; “severe” WMCs were
defined as single lesions or confluent areas of hyperintensity
20 mm in diameter. Microbleeds were only diagnosed when
2 mm and 10 mm in diameter and localized in cortical/
corticosubcortical regions excluding hemorrhage in basal ganglia,
thalamus, pons, or cerebellum. SH was diagnosed when located
distal to lobar hemorrhage. PRES was diagnosed from initial FLAIR
images when lesions had disappeared on follow-up examinations.
Contrast-enhancing lesions suggesting BBB leakage were diagnosed
using T1 and postcontrast T1 sequences.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as meanSEM. A 2-tailed unpaired Studentttest
was used to evaluate differences between groups. Two-way analysis
of variance was performed for Texas red efflux rates. Differences
were considered statistically significant when P0.05. Due to the
lack of a standardized design and a control patient group, descriptive
analysis was performed for the clinical study.
Results
CAA and BBB Dysfunction
Over a period of 1 year, 19 patients fulfilled the criteria for
“probable CAA” (9 female, 10 male, average age: 75 years;
age range: 61–84 years; 19 patients represent approximately
3% of all admissions to our unit within 12 months). No
patient was diagnosed with “definitive or probable CAA with
supporting evidence.” Details of patient data are summarized
in the Table.
Twelve of 19 patients (63%) had a history of hypertension.
At the time of discharge, 18 out of 19 patients (95%) were on
antihypertensive medication to treat blood pressure-induced
cerebral hemorrhage or to minimize the risk of hemorrhage
recurrence. Four patients were diabetic. Six patients were
diagnosed with severe WMCs, 2 of which were identified
with PRES and reversible contrast-enhancing lesions due to
BBB leakage. Five other patients were diagnosed with
moderate WMCs; the remaining 8 patients had mild WMCs.
The most common findings within the patient population
included lobar hemorrhage in 13 of 19 (68%) patients,
cortico/corticosubcortical microbleeds in 17 of 19 (89%)
patients, SHs in 7 of 19 (37%) patients, acute lacunar
ischemic infarcts at atypical sites in 4 of 19 (21%) patients,
and both PRES and reversible BBB leakage in 2 of 19 (10%)
patients (Figures 1 and 2). In these 2 patients we also
observed severe WMCs.
Human A
40
Decreases TJ Proteins and
Increases MMPs
To test the hypothesis that A compromises BBB integrity,
we exposed isolated rat brain microvessels to human A
40
(hA
40
) for 6 hours and determined protein expression of 4
major TJ proteins and 2 matrix-degrading MMPs by Western
blotting of microvessel membranes. Figure 3A shows that
hA
40
exposure decreased claudin-1 and claudin-5 protein
expression in brain microvessel membranes in a concentrationdependent
manner (claudin-1: control: 100%, 10 nmol/L A:
115%, 50 nmol/L A: 96%, 100 nmol/L A: 69%; claudin-5:
control: 100%, 10 nmol/L A: 118%, 50 nmol/L A: 92%, 100
nmol/L A: 81%; determined by densitometric analysis; data are
normalized to -actin-loading controls). Protein expression of
ZO-1 and occludin remained unchanged. In contrast, expression
of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was elevated with increasing hA
40
concentration (Figure 3B; MMP-2: control: 100%, 10 nmol/L
A: 175%, 50 nmol/L A: 224%, 100 nmol/L A: 194%;
MMP-9: control: 100%, 10 nmol/L A: 120%, 50 nmol/L A:
158%, 100 nmol/L A: 163%). Consistent with this, zymography
revealed a 2.4-fold increase of MMP-9 activity in brain
microvessels treated with hA
40
(Figure 3C; control: 100%,
hA
40
: 239%72%); MMP-2 activity was undetectable by
zymography.
We also analyzed TJ protein and MMP expression in brain
microvessels from 9-month-old transgenic hAPP mice (Tg2576
strain; hAPP gene with Swedish mutation). hAPP mice overexpress
hAPP resulting in Aoverproduction. At 9 months, hAPP
mice exhibit substantial cerebrovascular hA accumulation and
are therefore a model for CAA.20 Consistent with our data from
rat brain microvessels, claudin-1 and claudin-5 expression was
decreased in microvessels from hAPP mice compared with
microvessels from wild-type mice; ZO-1 and occludin expression
were unchanged (Figure 4). Densitometric analysis revealed
that claudin-1 expression was decreased by 84%10% and
claudin-5 expression was decreased by 43%1%. As in our A
experiments with microvessels, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression
was increased in microvessels from transgenic hAPP mice
compared with those from wild-type mice by 90%12% and
145%7%, respectively.
Our results demonstrate that hA
40
reduces expression of 2
major TJ proteins and increases expression of 2 matrixdegrading
enzymes in brain microvessels ex vivo and in brain
microvessels of hAPP mice in vivo. These findings suggest
that A triggers BBB leakage observed in CAA.
Increased BBB Permeability in Transgenic
hAPP Mice
To test the extent to which decreased claudin-1 and claudin-5
expression and increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression affect
BBB integrity, we measured the permeability of isolated brain
microvessels from wild-type and hAPP mice using a previously
established assay.15 In this assay, isolated brain microvessels are
loaded in a solution of fluorescent Texas red dye (641 Da,
2mol/L, 1 hour). After washing with buffer, Texas red efflux
from microvessel lumens is monitored by live cell imaging using
confocal microscopy; afterward, luminal Texas red fluorescence
is quantitated using image analysis software.

As previously described, we used a 100-mmol/L hypertonic
mannitol solution as a positive control to osmotically
increase microvessel permeability.17 Figure 5 shows that
Texas red efflux from microvessels from hAPP mice was
faster compared with efflux from microvessels from wildtype
mice; addition of mannitol increased Texas red efflux to
the maximum effect. Texas red efflux rates over the entire
time course were calculated as 0.2650.04 minutes1 (wildtype
), 0.3970.05 minutes1 (hAPP; P0.001 compared
with wild-type), 0.3360.05 minutes1(wild-type with mannitol
; P0.001 compared with wild-type), and 0.3560.03
minutes1 (hAPP with mannitol; P0.001 compared with
wild-type). Thus, Texas red efflux in microvessels from
hAPP mice was 1.5-fold that of microvessels from wild-type
mice indicating higher permeability. Note that luminal Texas
red fluorescence in microvessels from hAPP mice did not
reach the same levels as in microvessels treated with mannitol
(positive control for maximum barrier opening). This observation
argues for barrier leakage rather than full disruption.
Discussion
CAA is a multifaceted disorder resulting from A deposition
in brain microvessels that causes injury to the neurovascular
unit especially in the elderly. Here, we demonstrate in brain

microvessels from rats that hA
40
decreases expression of the
TJ proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5 and increases expression
and activity of the matrix-degrading enzymes MMP-2 and
MMP-9. We confirmed our results in microvessels from
transgenic hAPP mice that overproduce human A. Consistent
with these findings, we show increased Texas red efflux
in brain microvessels from hAPP mice compared with microvessels
from wild-type mice.
Our findings suggest that A contributes to loss of BBB
integrity that could be responsible for BBB dysfunction, cognitive
decline observed in patients with CAA, and additional
cerebrovascular pathology including SH, PRES, lacunar cerebral
ischemia, and BBB leakage. Indeed, in a group of 19 patients
with “probable CAA,” we identified 2 patients with BBB
leakage for MRI contrast agents, and 1 of the 2 patients already
presented with PRES 10 months earlier. Both contrast leakage
and PRES are likely due to increased BBB permeability, which
underscores the relevance of our animal data.
A Contributes to Loss of BBB Integrity
The effect of Aon BBB integrity has been studied in several
cell culture models. Gonzalez-Velasquez et al showed that
treatment of cultured human brain endothelial cells with 2.5
to 10 mol/L A
40
triggered the TJ protein ZO-1 to retreat
from the plasma membrane, which was accompanied by
decreased transendothelial electric resistance.11 Marco and
Skaper demonstrated that exposing rat brain endothelial cells
to 20 mol/L A
42
triggered ZO-1 and claudin-5 relocation
from the plasma membrane, a decrease in occludin expression
, and an increase in claudin-1 expression.21 Tai et al
demonstrated that A
40
activated microtubule-associated protein
kinase, which decreased occludin expression and increased
permeability in human brain endothelial cell cultures,
whereas claudin-5 and ZO-1 remained unchanged.22 Carrano
et al analyzed postmortem CAA patient brain slices for TJ
protein and observed a loss of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1
in brain microvessels.23 We show that hA
40
decreased rat
brain microvessel expression of claudin-1 and claudin-5,
whereas ZO-1 and occludin expression was not affected.
The discrepancies in our observations and those mentioned
are likely due to several factors. First, the A species were
different (hA
40
versus A
40
aggregates versus A
42
). We
used monomeric hA
40
, which is 1 main A species in AD
and CAA. Second, the A concentrations were different
(nanomolar versus micromolar). We used hA
40
at 100
nmol/L, which is comparable to A
40
levels found in brain
tissue from patients with AD, whereas micromolar A
concentrations do not reflect AD or CAA and probably lead
to acute toxicity.24 Third, the experimental models in the
mentioned studies were in vitro cultures of rat, mouse, or
immortalized human endothelial cells. In contrast, we used
intact, living brain capillaries ex vivo that were isolated from
rats and confirmed our data with microvessels from hAPP
mice (Tg2576). These mice overexpress the Swedish mutation
of the human APP gene (APPswe) and show progressive
A accumulation in brain and brain microvessels, A brain
aggregates similar to “senile plaques” in human AD, and
cognitive deficits that correlate with Abrain load.20In hAPP

mice, A also accumulates in brain microvessels, impairs
vascular smooth muscle function, and causes cell death, all of
which are CAA characteristics.25 Therefore, hAPP mice are a
well-established CAA model to study the A effect on the
neurovasculature and the mechanisms of these effects.13
Reports also show that expression of matrix-degrading
MMPs is changed in the CAA brain and that increased MMPs
contribute to BBB dysfunction. Lee et al found A-mediated
upregulation of MMP-9 in mouse endothelial cells and a
mouse CAA model (APPsw mice).26 These data are consistent
with our findings in microvessels exposed to A and
microvessels from hAPP mice showing increased MMP-2
expression and increased MMP-9 expression and activity. In
this regard, Taskanen et al performed microarrays with
human brain tissue and found an association between increased
MMP-19 expression and CAA with intracerebral
hemorrhage as well as an association between increased
MMP-26 expression and CAA alone.27
Together, our data suggest that A contributes to the loss
of barrier integrity in CAA by decreasing TJ protein expression
and increasing MMP expression and activity. Likely
consequences are barrier leakage and cortical cerebral hemorrhage
, which are consistent with our observations in patients
with CAA.

Amyloid- Brain Clearance
In the diseased brain, A accumulates in the pericapillary
space or in capillary membranes, which is a CAA hallmark.
A is mainly produced in neurons and astrocytes and then
released into brain interstitial fluid.28 Recent evidence suggests
that the BBB is critical for A brain clearance and that
this process involves 2 steps.29 Studies indicate that lowdensity
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 is responsible
for the first step—A uptake from the brain into endothelial
cells.30–32 In CAA, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 is
downregulated by serum response factor and myocardin,
which reduces lipoprotein receptor-related protein-mediated
clearance of A.33 Both transcription factors, serum response
factor and myocardin, have been shown to be overexpressed
in patients with AD and mouse models and are thought to be
involved in the development of CAA and the hypercontractile
arterial phenotype that is associated with brain hypoperfusion.4 The second step—A efflux from the endothelium into
blood—seems to be mediated by the efflux transporter
P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1).34,35 This was first demonstrated
by Cirrito et al who showed reduced A brain
clearance in P-gp-null mice.36 With regard to CAA, Vogelgesang
et al reported P-gp upregulation in human brain
microvessels in early CAA suggesting a compensatory mechanism
to increase A brain clearance. However, in later
stages of CAA, vessels with high A load showed no P-gp
expression.37 We recently demonstrated that P-gp is decreased
in brain microvessels from hAPP mice. Treating
these mice with pregnenolone–carbonitrile restored P-gp,
decreased A brain levels, and significantly reduced A
deposition in microvessels.14
Our data from brain microvessels suggest that A
40
contributes
to BBB dysfunction and our patient data indicate that
CAA is accompanied by multiple injuries, of which only
lobar hemorrhage and cognitive decline attributed to AD are
clinically relevant. It has been shown that neurovascular
injury in CAA results from amyloid aggregation when cerebrovascular
occlusive disease and inflammation are also
present.7 In this regard, it has been shown that soluble A
40
can cause inflammation with monocyte transmigration
through endothelial cells, decreased transendothelial electric
resistance, and TJ redistribution, all of which contribute to
BBB dysfunction.11 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
soluble A
40
generates reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory
cytokines, which can induce MMPs that promote
cerebral hemorrhage through basal membrane degradation.10
Finally, A
40
-mediated injury to the neurovasculature unit
could have profound effects on neuroendocrine crosstalk
among neurons, astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and endothelial
cells ultimately resulting in BBB breakdown. Postmortem
analysis of brains from patients with advanced AD
demonstrated that thinning and discontinuities of the vascular
basal membrane are associated with BBB leakage and brain
penetration of the plasma protein prothrombin.38 However,
BBB leakage, especially in the elderly, could also be due to other
diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and inflammation.39,40
Clinical Findings
Noninvasive neuroimaging is critical to diagnose CAA.
Imaging can be indirect, for example, cerebral CT and MRI,

to visualize hemorrhage indicative of CAA, or direct, for
example, positron emission tomography, to visualize deposition
of A labeled with the Pittsburgh Compound B.41,42 We
used MRI to characterize 19 patients with “probable CAA”
for neurovascular pathology. We found the following 3 main
characteristics.
Superficial Hemosiderosis
SH in the context of CAA appears to be more frequent than
previously described and occurred in 7 of 19 patients with
CAA, who became symptomatic with acute cephalgia. SH is
characterized by distinct symptoms such as absent headache,
focal seizures mimicking transient ischemic attacks, and
migraine aura-like symptoms.43 SH can only be diagnosed in
patients with at least “probable CAA” and after exclusion of
vasculitis, arterial dissection, dural arteriovenous fistulas, or
cortical venous thrombosis. Finelli reported of 4 patients with
CAA with SH and included a summary of 7 previously
published cases in the report.41 Raposo et al reanalyzed MRI
data from 10 patients with SH according to the Boston criteria
and reclassified 8 of 10 patients as SH with probable CAA
and 2 of 10 patients as SH with “possible CAA.”8 Note that
at this point we cannot rule out if additional factors such as
hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia could have
potentially contributed to CAA in these patients.
Ischemic Lacunar Infarction, WMCs, and CAA
Menon and Kidwell reported on 1 patient with evolving small
vessel ischemic injury detected by diffusion-weighted imaging.7 We observed this phenomenon in 4 of 19 patients, none
of whom displayed symptoms such as transitory ischemic
attacks or stroke. Without autopsy data, one could speculate
that endothelial dysfunction leads to small vessel occlusion
and silent brain infarcts that could contribute to WMC and
cognitive decline, which may contribute to the development
of dementia.44 Again, given our patient collective with acute
neurological symptoms, the true incidence of these ischemic
lesions may be overestimated.
PRES and CAA-Induced Inflammation
Symptoms of PRES are diverse and include headache, confusion
, seizures, and vision loss. In 1 patient, Kofler et al
linked PRES to CAA based on MRI evidence FLAIR.
Additional evidence from a brain biopsy included endothelial
cell activation, T-cell trafficking, and increased expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor, all indicating inflammation.6 The authors concluded that PRES was triggered by
inflammation from an upper respiratory infection the patient
had earlier. In contrast, Bernstein and colleagues interpreted
a similar finding as CAA-induced inflammation (CAA-I) and
stated that the resolution of symptoms was due to successful
steroid treatment.45 In a recent review, Chung et al described
overlapping CAA-I symptoms with those of PRES, including
headaches, cognitive and behavioral changes as well as
seizures and focal neurological deficits.9 In addition, histopathologic
evidence of CAA-I includes either focal spots with
inflammatory cells such as multinucleated giant cells and
macrophages or infiltration by epithelioid cells adjacent to
amyloid-loaded microvessels. The majority of reports describe
CAA-I diagnosis using FLAIR-MRI and only rarely
using postcontrast-enhanced MRI.
In our study, PRES was diagnosed in 2 of 19 patients
(10%) and reversible BBB leakage was also diagnosed in 2 of
19 patients. With the proposed criteria, all 4 of these patients
would be classified as probable CAA-I. In our patients, PRES
was found in brain areas with microbleeds that are a potential
trigger for edema due to reduced expression of the TJ proteins
claudin-1 and claudin-5.
Classic PRES etiology is not fully understood but could
result from vasogenic edema with decreased serum albumin
levels and increased BBB permeability.46 PRES is often
associated with hypertension and medically induced immunosuppression.
Note that CAA-I has a similar pathophysiological
background and that hemorrhage can also be caused
by immunosuppression.47However, PRES and CAA-I clearly
differ in their inflammatory response and endothelial activation.
In addition, increased BBB permeability seen in both
states could differ and be due to paracellular or transcellular
barrier opening. For example, reduced expression of TJ
proteins could increase paracellular BBB permeability allowing
MRI contrast agents to enter the brain.48 Indeed, Carrano
et al recently showed that A reduced claudin-5, occludin,
and ZO-1 expression in human brain microvessels.23 We did
not observe reduced occludin and ZO-1 expression but found
reduced claudin-1 and claudin-5 expression in A-treated rat
brain microvessels and in microvessels from hAPP mice.
Consistent with this, paracellular BBB permeability was
increased in brain microvessels from hAPP mice. Alternatively
, edema could be caused by increased transcellular
permeability due to changes in plasma membrane proteins
that are involved in maintaining central nervous system
water/electrolyte homeostasis. Whether or not this is the case
in CAA is unclear.
Together, it remains to be shown if PRES and CAA-I are
linked and contribute to overall CAA pathology.
Study Limitations
This study has 3 limitations: (1) recruitment of patients with
CAA was performed in the stroke unit setting as opposed to
a memory clinic with focus on acute therapy and diagnostics.
Therefore, a standard stroke MRI protocol was used and
contrast agents were only given when deemed necessary by
the attending neuroradiologist. Neuropsychological testing or
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was not performed, which is
important for dementia work-up but not acute stroke therapy.
Patient control groups with other underlying factors (eg,
PRES or SH) were not included in our study and brain biopsy
or histopathologic verification was not performed. Therefore,
the patients with CAA included in our study may differ
significantly from patients in other studies. Future prospective
and longitudinal studies should link neurological, neuroradiological
, and neuropsychological findings in acute stroke
and neurodegenerative neurology to better characterize CAA;
(2) the sensitivity of gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents
(approximately 600 Da) to detect BBB leakage is dependent
on the MRI field strength, the MRI sequence, and the timing
after administration of contrast agents; and (3) the animal
model used here (hAPP mice) resembles the genetic variants

of CAA, and thus, our findings likely do not apply to patients
with spontaneous CAA. Small animal MRI with high field
strength to visualize cortical microbleeds may further help to
characterize hAPP mice with respect to CAA.
Experimental Therapy of AD/CAA
Two strategies that increase Abrain clearance and lower A
brain levels have been proposed to treat CAA/AD.49,50 One
approach, A immunotherapy, capitalizes on antibodies that
bind and clear plasma A, thereby creating a peripheral
“sink” that accelerates removal of soluble A from the
brain.51 In a recent study, passive immunization was used in
patients with AD who were treated with the A antibody
bapineuzumab,38 and treatment with this antibody at the
highest dose led to mild symptomatic and reversible vasogenic
edema in 2 of 19 patients (10%). Clinical symptoms
were similar to those observed in PRES and CAA-I indicating
that the cerebral endothelium is the target of this therapy and
thus, likely an interesting target for AD and CAA. This
approach—passive immunization with an A antibody—represents
a case of “life imitating art” in which therapeutically
administered antibodies mimic naturally occurring anti-A
antibodies.52 A similar approach is based on using recombinant
, soluble lipoprotein receptor-related protein that also
binds A has thus far only been tested in mice.49 Another
strategy to treat CAA and AD targets the efflux transporter
P-gp at the BBB.49P-gp has been shown to be involved in A
brain clearance but its expression is reduced in AD.14,44,53,54
Therefore, in this approach, P-gp is restored through activation
of the nuclear receptor PXR to improve A brain
clearance. Given that a large number of drugs are P-gp
substrates that could act as competitive P-gp inhibitors,
modulation of P-gp could result in drug–drug interactions.
Such complications should be considered when treating
elderly patients with AD using multiple medications and
could limit the therapeutic benefit of BBB P-gp induction.
Conclusions
Reduced A brain-to-blood clearance through the BBB,
compromised BBB integrity, and increased BBB permeability
could all contribute to WMCs and mental decline in
CAA/AD. Indeed, our patient and animal data suggest amyloid
deposition in the neurovasculature contributes to dynamic
multifocal endothelial dysfunction in CAA. Our study
further suggests that the Boston criteria for the diagnosis of
CAA might need to be refined to include SH, ischemia, and
CAA-I with MRI findings of PRES and BBB leakage.
Future studies should focus on serial neuroimaging, BBB
and inflammatory biomarkers, other cerebrovascular risk
factors, and treatment to identify the events that trigger BBB
dysfunction. A prospective and longitudinal study should be
conducted to investigate the overall incidence of SH, ischemia
, and CAA-I with MRI findings of PRES and BBB
leakage in acute and chronic phases of the disease; the
findings should be correlated with the Boston criteria.
Together, our findings suggest that the BBB plays a crucial
role in CAA/AD pathology. Novel therapeutic strategies that
prevent A-mediated BBB leakage and restore BBB function
could help improve CAA/AD treatment.

Abstract
背景および目的：脳アミロイド血管症（CAA）は血液脳関
門（BBB）内のアミロイドβ（Aβ）沈着を特徴とする変性疾
患である。CAA は，脳葉出血，皮質微小出血，虚血，お
よび脳表ヘモジデリン沈着症を含む神経血管構造の損傷
の一因となる。我々は，Aβが BBB を損なうことが CAA
病理の一因であると仮定した。
方法：「CAA の可能性が高い」急性脳卒中患者 19 例につい
て，MRI および臨床所見に基づく神経血管病理の特徴を明
らかにした。また，摘出したラットの脳微小血管における
密着結合（tight junction）蛋白およびマトリックスメタロプ
ロテアーゼ（MMP）の発現に対する A βの影響を調べた。
結果：19 例の CAA 患者のうち 2 例に，BBB 透過性の上
昇を示す無症候性の BBB 漏出および後部可逆性脳症症候
群が認められた。白質の変化に加えて，ラクナ虚血を示唆
する拡散異常が CAA を有する 19 例のうち 4 例に認められ
た。また，脳表ヘモジデリン沈着症が 19 例中 7 例に認め
られた。Aβ

は密着結合蛋白クローディン -1（claudin-1）
およびクローディン -5 の発現を減少させ，MMP-2 および
MMP-9 の発現を増加させた。ヒトアミロイド前駆体蛋白
を過剰発現するトランスジェニックマウスの脳微小血管の
解析で，密着結合蛋白および MMP 蛋白について同じ発現
パターンが明らかになった。密着結合の発現および活性の
低下ならびに MMP の発現および活性の上昇と一致して，
ヒトアミロイド前駆体蛋白マウスの脳微小血管では野生型
対照の微小血管と比べて透過性が上昇していた。
結論：本研究の所見は，Aβが脳微小血管における密着
結合およびMMPの発現の変化の一因となり，その結
果 BBB の健全性が損なわれることを示している。我々
は，Aβは BBB 漏出の原因となり，BBB 透過性の評価は
CAA 進行の特徴を明らかにするのに役立ち，治療効果の
代替マーカーとなる可能性があると結論づける。
