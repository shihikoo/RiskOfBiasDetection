Abstract
This study investigated the effects of 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamido
) acetic acid (IOX3), a selective
small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl
hydroxylases, on mouse brains subject to transient focal
cerebral ischaemia. Male, 8- to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice
were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) either immediately or 24 h after receiving IOX3. Mice
receiving IOX3 at 20 mg/kg 24 h prior to the MCAO had better
neuroscores and smaller blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption
and infarct volumes than mice receiving the vehicle, whereas
those having IOX3 at 60 mg/kg showed no significant
changes. IOX3 treatment immediately before MCAO was not
neuroprotective. IOX3 up-regulated HIF-1a, and increased
EPO expression in mouse brains. In an in vitro BBB model
(RBE4 cell line), IOX3 up-regulated HIF-1a and delocalized
ZO-1. Pre-treating IOX3 on RBE4 cells 24 h before oxygen–
glucose deprivation had a protective effect on endothelial
barrier preservation with ZO-1 being better localized, while
immediate IOX3 treatment did not. Our study suggests that
HIF stabilization with IOX3 before cerebral ischaemia is
neuroprotective partially because of BBB protection, while
immediate application could be detrimental. These results
provide information for studies aimed at the therapeutic
activation of HIF pathway for neurovascular protection from
cerebral ischaemia.

The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription
factors that regulate gene expression in response to cellular
hypoxia (Semenza 1999; Pugh and Ratcliffe 2003; Kaelin
and Ratcliffe 2008; Greer et al. 2012). A mechanism by
which the human HIFs ‘sense’ oxygen levels is enabled by
four oxygen-sensitive hydroxylases: three prolyl hydroxylases
(PHDs) and one asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor
inhibiting HIF (FIH) (Schofield and Ratcliffe 2004). In
normoxia, hydroxylation of either of two prolyl residues in
the oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a
promotes its interaction with the von Hippel–Lindau
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Thereafter, HIF-1a is targeted

for ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation
(Semenza 1999; Pugh and Ratcliffe 2003; Kaelin and
Ratcliffe 2008; Greer et al. 2012). In addition, hydroxylation
of an asparaginyl residue in the C-terminal transcriptional
activation domain (CAD) of HIF-1a reduces the association
of HIF-1a with transcriptional coactivator proteins, thus
inhibiting HIF-mediated transcription (Lando et al. 2002). In
hypoxia, activity of the HIF hydroxylases is reduced, and
levels of transcriptionally active HIF rise, causing induction
of a gene array that contributes to cell protection via multiple
mechanisms, including angiogenesis, vascular remodelling,
metabolic regulation and erythropoiesis (Manalo et al.
2005). Inhibition of HIF hydroxylases has been shown to
activate HIF and protect the adult rat kidney, mouse bowel
and heart, rat and mouse brain from ischaemic and oxidative
stress-induced injury without toxic effects upon systemic
administration (Siddiq et al. 2005; Bernhardt et al. 2006,
2010; Baranova et al. 2007; Fraisl et al. 2009).
We have previously applied dimethyl-oxalylglycine
(DMOG), a prodrug diester form of the broad-spectrum 2-
oxoglutarate (2-OG) oxygenase inhibitor (N-oxaylglycine),
to rats subjected to focal cerebral ischaemia (Nagel et al.
2011). We found that DMOG protected the rat brains from
ischaemia/reperfusion injury and up-regulated a number of
HIF-regulated genes and proteins, but that the observed
protection was probably not simply related to HIF-1a levels
present at the time animals were killed (Nagel et al. 2011).
The liberated form of DMOG, N-oxaylglycine, inhibits many
2-OG-dependent enzymes (including chromatin-modifying
enzymes) (Rose et al. 2012) and may therefore affect other
signalling pathways and important cellular processes, e.g. the
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related pathway for activating
antioxidant gene expression in microvascular endothelial
cells (Natarajan et al. 2009).
The above study prompted us to undertake further
research employing a much more selective inhibitor of the
HIF PHDs in a mouse model of ischaemic stroke to evaluate
its effects on cerebral ischaemia. 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamido
) acetic acid (IOX3) (Thalhammer
et al. 2012) is a member of a novel class of potent small
molecules that inhibit HIF PHDs (Stubbs et al. 2009; Tian
et al. 2011). The molecular structure of IOX3 (mass
280.66 Da) is believed to be identical to that of FG-2216
(Rose et al. 2011). FG2216 induces erythropoietin (EPO)
production in mice and rhesus macaques (Hsieh et al. 2007),
as well as in healthy human subjects and haemodialysis
patients (Bernhardt et al. 2010). This compound has been
studied under different names [bicyclic isoquinolinyl
inhibitor (BIQ or BIC), 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-
3-carboxamido) acetate] by different research groups (Stubbs et al. 2009; Leung et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2012). The
aim of our study was to define the effects of IOX3 on mouse
brain following transient focal cerebral ischaemia, and to
investigate the molecular mechanisms for these effects.
Methods
Synthesis of IOX3
IOX3 was synthesized as reported in Stubbset al.(2009). IOX3 was
dissolved first in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then in Fisher
Scientific Buffer (Fisher scientific UK Ltd, Loughborough, UK) pH
7.0 (5% DMSO/buffer).
In vivo transient focal cerebral ischaemia
Transient focal ischaemia
A single dose of IOX3 (20 or 60 mg/kg) or vehicle (5% DMSO/
buffer) was given to male, 8- to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice through a
tail vein injection. One day or immediately after IOX3 injection, the
mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) under anaesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane in O
2
/N
2
O (1 : 3) as
described (Chenet al.2012). Briefly, underthe operating microscope,
the right common carotid artery, the right external carotid artery
(ECA) and the right internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. A
silicone rubber-coated monofilament (Doccol Corp., Redlands, CA,
USA) was introduced into the ECA and pushed up the ICA until
resistance was felt, effectively blocking the middle cerebral artery.
Transcranial measurements of cerebral bloodflow (CBF) were made
by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) (Oxford Optronix, Oxfordshire,
UK). The surgical procedure was considered adequate if ≥ 70%
reduction in regional CBF (rCBF) occurred immediately after
placement of the intraluminal occluding suture; otherwise, mice were
excluded. The suture remained inserted for 45 min, after which it was
removed to allow reperfusion over the ICA and the circle of Willis and
the ECA was permanently tied. Sham-operated (SO) mice underwent
the same anaesthesia and surgical regime; however, the monofilament
was only temporarily inserted into the intracranial portion of the
internal carotid and withdrawn immediately to control for direct
damage of the arterial intima. All procedures were in accordance with
the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Temperature regulation
Mice were implanted with intraabdominal radiofrequency probes
(TA10TA-F20; DSI, St. Paul, MN, USA) 7 days before MCAO. Core
temperature was sampled every 20 s using receivers (RLA-1020;
Data Sciences Int., St. Paul, MN, USA) interfaced to a computer
running ART 2.2 (DSI). This telemetry system allows temperature
monitoring/control in the freely moving animal (Chen et al. 2012).
Behaviour
Twenty four hours after the surgery, mouse behaviour was assessed
as described (Chen et al. 2012). Behavioural assessment consisted
of scoring: forelimb flexion, reduced resistance to lateral push, gait
towards the paretic side and rotational behaviour (Bederson et al.
1986; Barber et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2012). Scoring was performed
by a trained individual unaware of treatment allocation.
Tissue processing
Mice were given sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg intraperitoneally)
24 h after MCAO, and were perfused with chilled (4°C) phosphatebuffered
saline (PBS), followed by 4% formalin (in PBS). The
brains were then removed and stored in chilled (4°C) 10% formalin
(in PBS) before embedding in paraffin wax. Representative coronal

6- and 10-lm sections were cut from each 1-mm slice of embedded
brain along the rostral-caudal axis using a microtome.
Infarction volume measurement
Nissl stain of 10-lm sections from each 1 mm of brain slice was used
for assessing infarction volume (Chenet al.2012). Photomicrographs
were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E110M microscope (Nikon,
Surrey, UK). Areas of infarction were delineated by a blinded
investigator using a NIS elements imaging software (Nikon). The
infarction volume was calculated as the sum of section volumes made
by multiplying the area of infarction on each section by the thickness
of the corresponding slice. The infarction volume was corrected for
oedema using the following equation: corrected infarct volume = total infarct volume  [(right (ipsilateral) hemisphere volume left (contralateral) hemisphere volume)]. The infarction
volume was presented as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.
TUNEL assay for the detection of apoptotic cells
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay was performed on neighbouring 6-lm sections using
an ApopTag Plus Fluorescein in situ Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The sections were mounted with medium containing 4,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough
, UK) as a counter-stain. Fluorescence was detected using a
Nikon Eclipse E110M fluorescent microscope (Nikon) and images
were processed using the NIS elements imaging software (Nikon).
Four standard non-overlapping high powerfields from the ischaemia
boundary and two in the ischaemic core were counted. The ratio of
TUNEL-positive cells to DAPI-positive nuclei was determined.
Blood–brain barrier disruption measurement
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption was analysed using mouse
IgG immunohistochemistry on 6-lm sections (Chen et al. 2012).
Briefly, sections were de-waxed, rehydrated and the antigen binding
sites were exposed. Both endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific binding sites were blocked before incubating in biotinylated
anti-mouse IgG antibody (1 : 100; Vector Laboratories) for 2 h at
room temperature (20°C). Immunohistochemical staining was
performed following the protocol of the ABC staining kit (Vector
Laboratories). Photomicrographs were obtained with a Nikon
Eclipse E110M microscope (Nikon). Areas of BBB disruption were
delineated by a blinded investigator using a NIS elements imaging
software (Nikon). The BBB disruption volume was calculated as the
sum of section volumes made by multiplying the area of mouse IgG
extravasation on each section by the thickness of the corresponding
slice. BBB disruption volume was corrected for oedema and
presented as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.
HIF-1a immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Neighbouring 6-lm sections were treated as above for HIF-1a
immunohistochemistry and without blockage of endogenous
peroxidase activity for HIF-1a immunofluorescence. Sections
were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal HIF-1a antibody
(1 : 100; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) at 4°C overnight
followed by appropriate secondary antibodies, at room temperature
(20°C) for 2 h. Immunostaining was detected and images were
processed as above.
RT-PCR
In separate mouse groups, at 6 and 24 h after receiving IOX3
through tail veins, mice were killed with sodium pentobarbital
(70 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The brain and kidney were rapidly
removed, rinsed in cold PBS and immediately snap-frozen in liquid
N
2
and stored at 80°C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using Agilent
Technologies’ (Santa Clara, CA, USA) AffinityScript cDNA
synthesis kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was
used to carry out real-time PCR for genes of interest using Agilent
Technologies’ Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for nine HIF-regulated
genes were designed in exons only and were designed to be of
different sizes for genomic DNA and cDNA (Table S1). The relative
gene expression was calculated using the efficiency-corrected
calculation model (Pfaffl 2001).
In vitro brain endothelial cell culture
Cell culture
The rat brain endothelial cell line RBE4 was cultivated in 50 : 50
a-minimal essential medium/Ham’s F-10 medium mixture (Gibco,
Zug, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
300 lg/mL Geneticin (Gibco) and 1 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth
factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) on rat tail collagen-coated
Petri dishes and coverslips as described (Al Ahmad et al. 2009). For
hypoxia exposure, O
2
concentration was constantly monitored and
maintained at 1% in a purpose-built hypoxic glove-box chamber
(InVivO
2
400; Ruskinn Technologies, Pencoed, UK). Immediately
prior to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD), maintenance media were
replaced with glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(Gibco) containing all other supplements. OGD experiments were
carriedoutinthehypoxicchamberat1%O

,5%CO

and37°C for 24 h.
Drug administration
IOX3 was prepared as described above. Ten or 50 lM IOX3 or
vehicle (5% DMSO/buffer) was added to the culture media under
either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. For preconditioning experiments
, 10 or 50 lM IOX3 or vehicle (5% DMSO/buffer) was
added to the maintenance culture media 24 h prior to the OGD. For
immediate exposure, drug was added directly to OGD media at the
start of the experiment.
Microscopy
Micrograph pictures of fluorescence immunocytochemistry for
zonula occludens (ZO)-1 (rabbit anti-ZO-1, 1 : 100; Invitrogen,
Basel, Switzerland) were taken using an inverted fluorescence
microscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland) coupled
to an 8-bit CCD camera (Axiocam HR; Zeiss). DAPI was used as a
counter-stain.
Permeability assay
Barrier function was assessed by paracellular permeability of RBE4
monolayers grown on rat tail collagen-coated TranswellsTM
(Corning, Schiphol, The Netherlands) to sodium fluorescein
(376 Da) as described previously (Al Ahmad et al. 2009). All
obtained measurements were normalized to the 0-h time point of the

corresponding treatment. A clearance slope was established from the
measurements obtained at the different time points and used to
calculate permeability values (Pe) (Rist et al. 1997).
MTT assay
Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, 15 000
RBE4 cells were seeded and cultured on 96-well culture plates in
different conditions for 48 h (i.e. to confluency). Cells were then
exposed to MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) for 1 h. Subsequently, the
medium was removed and 1/10 volume of DMSO was added to
the wells for 5 min to dissolve the dye incorporated in the cells. The
absorbance was then measured at 570 nm with background
subtraction performed at 630 nm.
Immunoblots
Confluent monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and homogenized
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) supplemented with a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Accurate
protein concentration was determined using Pierce (Rockford, IL,
USA) bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Thirty micrograms of total protein were
separated by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk
dissolved in Tris-buffered saline followed by incubation at 4°C
overnight in the presence of antibodies directed against b-actin
(1 : 5000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or HIF-1a(1 : 1000;
Novus Biologicals). Membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween-20 in
Tris-buffered saline and incubated in the presence of horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
, Suffolk, UK). Band detection was performed by enhanced
chemiluminescent substrate and visualized using luminescent image
analyser LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Dielsdorf, Switzerland). Blot quantification
was performed using ImageJ software (ImageJ; NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA). Immunoreactivity was correct for loading using the betaactin
quantification.
Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean SEM or median with interquartile
range where appropriate. Parametric data were analysed using
Student’s t-test for single comparisons or one-way ANOVA followed
by the Bonferroni’s test for multiple comparisons. Non-parametric
data were assessed using a Mann–Whitney test or the Kruskal–
Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Continuous data
of body temperature, activity and rCBF were analysed by ANOVA for
repeated measurements (rm-ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc
comparisons. Mortality rates were compared with the Fisher’s exact
test. Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationships
among histology data. Statistical analyses were performed using the
SPSS for Windows program (version 17). A p-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Intravenous injection of IOX3 and vehicle caused no
apparent physiological changes (e.g. temperature, behaviour,
weight), while MCAO resulted in a greater than 70%
reduction in rCBF from baseline in each mouse of all
experimental groups as required by the protocol. The
reduction of rCBF in IOX3 and vehicle groups was
statistically indistinguishable, nor was the return of rCBF
during reperfusion (Figure S1). The core temperature was
reduced in all mice after the surgery but rapidly returned to
the normal range with the aid of the telemetric temperature
control system (Figure S2). No significant differences were
observed in mortality following MCAO, which were about
10% in all animals. There was similar loss of body weight in
the IOX3 and vehicle-treated groups 24 h after MCAO,
which ranged from 8% to 15% of baseline bodyweight
(Table S2).
Behavioural tests assessed at 24 h after reperfusion
showed that the mice treated with IOX3 at 20 mg/kg 1 day
before (preIOX3-20) had significantly better neuroscores
than those with vehicle (preVEH-20) (Fig. 1b). Although
there was some apparent improvement with preIOX3-60
compared to preVEH-60, it did not reach statistical significance
(Fig. 1b). There were no significant differences in
neuroscores between mice when the drug was given
immediately before MCAO (immIOX3) and those having
the vehicle (immVEH) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, immIOX3-60
had significantly worse neuroscores than immIOX3-20
(Fig. 1a). Further TUNEL assay analyses indicated that
there was no significant difference in the apoptotic ratio
between these two groups (Figure S3).
Nissl staining showed clear infarct areas in brain sections
of mice having MCAO and no infarction in SO mice
(Fig. 2a). The infarct volume of preIOX3-20 was significantly
less than preVEH-20, while there were no differences
between preIOX3-60 and preVEH-60 (Fig. 2c), and between
immIOX3 and immVEH (Fig. 2b).
Mouse IgG extravasation, an index of BBB disruption,
was seen in brain sections of mice having MCAO but was
not seen in brain sections of SO mice (Fig. 3a). The volume
of BBB disruption in preIOX3-20 was significantly smaller
than in preVEH-20 (Fig. 3c), while no significant difference
was found in other comparisons (Fig. 3b and c).
HIF-1a was not observed in brain sections of SO mice
receiving the vehicle (Fig. 4a), but was detected in brain
sections of SO mice receiving IOX3 24 h prior to the SO
operation (Fig. 4b). In the MCAO mice, HIF-1a was upregulated
in the ipsilateral hemisphere of mice either
receiving the vehicle (Fig. 4c) or IOX3 (Fig. 4d) 24 h prior
to the MCAO operation.
RT-PCR was performed with nine representative HIF
target genes on mouse brains and kidney in separated mouse
groups. There was substantial up-regulation of the EPO gene
in both brain and kidney of mice receiving IOX3 compared
to those that received vehicle only (Fig. 5). There was no
significant up-regulation in eight other HIF target genes (data
not shown).

To further investigate the direct effects of IOX3 on BBB
morphology and function, we then applied IOX3 in an in
vitro BBB model. IOX3 at 10 and 50 lM significantly upregulated
HIF-1ain the RBE4 cells under both normoxia and
hypoxia (Fig. 6).
Under normoxic conditions without IOX3 treatment, ZO-1
staining was continuous at cell–cell borders throughout the
monolayer. When exposing to 10 lM IOX3, the monolayer
remained largely intact, whereas exposure to 50 lM IOX3
induced disruption of ZO-1 localization with loss of staining
between some cells (Fig. 7). Under hypoxic conditions, gap
formation at cell–cell borders was visible and exposure to
50 lM IOX3 further exaggerated the hypoxic effect with
significant delocalization of ZO-1 from endothelial cell
junctions (Fig. 7).
Glucose deprivation disrupted ZO-1 localization resulting
in the appearance of stretched staining at the contacts and
gaps (Fig. 8). Hypoxia further exaggerated this response
with a more obvious loss of ZO-1 at cell junctions
particularly when glucose was simultaneously withdrawn
(Fig. 8). Exposure to IOX3 prior to OGD clearly improved
ZO-1 localization and prevented the effects of OGD (Fig. 8).
In contrast, exposure to IOX3 immediately prior to OGD did
not improve ZO-1 localization and, in some cases, seemed to
aggravate the condition with the majority of cells still
exhibiting widespread loss of expression at cell–cell contacts
with frayed staining and clumping frequently observed
(Fig. 8).
Combined oxygen and glucose withdrawal (OGD) significantly
increased barrier permeability by two to threefold
(Fig. 9). Pre-treatment of the cells with IOX3 for 24 h before
OGD prevented the cells from barrier dysfunction, while
immediate exposure to the drug and OGD had no such
protection (Fig. 9).
To rule out the possibility that the changes observed
were because of alterations in cell survival, an MTT assay
was performed. Endothelial survival was reduced when
cells were exposed to hypoxia and further impaired when
glucose was withdrawn from the media. However, drug
treatment did not affect cell survival at either concentration
during preconditioning or immediate exposure
(Figure S4).

Discussion
In this study, we found that (at 20 mg/kg) IOX3, a reported
selective inhibitor of the HIF PHDs, only exerts neuroprotective
properties in a mouse model of focal cerebral
ischaemia, when given 24 h prior to the ischaemic insult.
Immediate treatment with IOX3 before the onset of MCAO
was ineffective. Moreover, higher doses of IOX3 (60 mg/kg)
with pre-treatment failed to show this neuroprotective effect.
One potential downstream mediator of the observed protective
effect was EPO, which showed an elevated expression
profile in the brain and the kidney. Further in vitro studies on
endothelial brain cells revealed that one potential mechanism
of the abolished protection at 60 mg/kg might be increased
BBB permeability. In the in vitro studies, in correction with
significant delocalization of ZO-1 from endothelial cell
junctions, HIF-1a was up-regulated by IOX3. Pre-treating
IOX3 on RBE4 cells 24 h before OGD had a protective
effect on BBB integrity with ZO-1 being better localized,
while simultaneous IOX3 treatment did not.
Hypoxia/ischaemic preconditioning is considered the next
most powerful experimental neuroprotective strategy after
hypothermia (Dirnagl et al. 2009). HIF is of central importance
in the response to hypoxia/ischaemia, and is essential
for cerebral ischaemia tolerance induced by hypoxic preconditioning
(Ratan et al. 2004). The HIF-a isoforms act as
transducers of the response to hypoxia, whereas the HIF
hydroxylases (PHDs) are responsible for regulating HIF
activity in an oxygen-dependent manner (Fraisl et al. 2009).
Pharmacological inhibition of HIF PHDs can act as mimics
of hypoxic/ischaemic conditioning (Li et al. 2008; Nagel
et al. 2011; Wacker et al. 2012; Engelhardt et al. 2014).
Analogues of 2-OG such as DMOG inhibit the PHDs but
they are not specific for HIF PHDs and may affect other
signalling pathways (Loenarz and Schofield 2008; Nigel
et al. 2011; Rose et al. 2012). IOX3 has been reported to

specifically inhibit the HIF PHDs over FIH, and likely, at
least some other human 2-OG oxygenases (Tian et al. 2011),
including the fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO)
(Aik et al. 2013).
Hypoxic/ischaemic preconditioning has two time windows
of protection, an immediate one mediated mostly by local
factors, including adenosine and the ATP-sensitive potassium
channel, and a later one lasting for 1–3 days which is
mediated by genetic reprogramming (Dirnagl et al. 2009).
For pharmacological preconditioning through HIF PHD
inhibition, only the latter one can be assumed to be effective,
unless the applied drug has some HIF-unrelated protective
effects. To the best of our knowledge, no direct neuroprotective
effects of IOX-3 have been reported to date. IOX3
treatment immediately before MCAO had no neuroprotective
effects at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia in vivo. Similarly, in
the in vitro experiments, IOX3 did not improve the barrier
function when added to RBE4 cells immediately before the
OGD; however, IOX3 improved ZO-1 localization and
prevented the effects of OGD when given 24 h prior to the
OGD. This is consistent with a recent study on neurons, in
which preconditioning with DMOG for 24 h prior to OGD
induces protein stabilization of HIF-1a, and significantly
reduces OGD-induced neuronal death (Ogle et al. 2012).
Notably, a single post-treatment of FG 4497 was sufficient to
decrease tissue damage at a later time point (i.e. 7 days) after
permanent MCAO (Reischl et al. 2014). It will be interesting
to further study the effects of IOX3 treatment started in the
pivotal therapeutic time window after onset of ischaemic
stroke at some later time points (e.g. 3 or 7 days).
To detect putative protective downstream targets acting as
effectors of the HIF response, we analysed a set of nine HIF-
regulated genes. Interestingly, within the limits of detection,
only EPO showed a significant up-regulation in the brain and
the kidney. Although this was a little surprising, the factors
that up-regulate the sets of HIF target genes in given cell
types/contexts are only at early stage of being identified, and
it appears that factors other than limitation of PHD activity
may be important in the context of our investigations. HIF is
a highly pleiotropic transcription factor, likely regulating 500
genes directly and many others indirectly (Geiger et al.
2011). It is important to note that the sets of HIF target genes

that are up-regulated are highly context dependent, depending
on factors such as HIF-1a/HIF-2a levels, the PHD
isoform present and whether the C-terminal transcriptional
activating domain of HIF-a cofactors is hydroxylated (Mole
et al. 2009). Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the
activity of the HIF hydroxylase can be regulated by factors
other than oxygen availabilities, e.g. tricarboxylic acid cycle
intermediate levels (Tannahill et al. 2013). IOX3 specifically
inhibits PHDs over the FIH, as shown in cellular studies
(Tian et al. 2011). Since FIH is reported to have a
Fig. 7 Effects of IOX3 on ZO-1 localization in BRE4 cells. Immunocytochemistry
showed that the localization of ZO-1 (green) at cell–cell
borders was continuous under normoxic conditions without IOX3
treatment. On exposure to 10 lM IOX3 under normoxic conditions, the
monolayer remained largely intact, whereas in contrast, exposure to
50 lM IOX3 resulted in increased ZO1 disruption with stretched
appearance of staining between cells (denoted by arrows). Under
hypoxic conditions ZO-1 disruption at cell–cell borders was evident but
not further influenced by 10 lM IOX3 (denoted by arrows). On the
contrary, exposure to 50 lM IOX3 further exaggerated the hypoxic
effect with significant delocalization of ZO-1 from endothelial cell
junctions, i.e. frequent loss of cell–cell border staining and gap
formation (denoted by arrows). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)

Additional oxygen deprivation (OGD)
resulted in dramatic disruption of ZO-1 with

with IOX3 significantly improved
ZO-1 stability and localization. On the

comparatively smaller effect on HIF-2a than HIF-1a (at least
in some contexts) (Koivunen et al. 2004; Bracken et al.
2006), it is possible that IOX3 could induce production of
more active HIF-2a than HIF1-a. Notably, it is HIF2 (rather
than HIF1) that is reported to regulate EPO expression in the
brain (Yeo et al. 2008; Kunze et al. 2012). Although further
studies must be performed to confirm this, the strong upregulation
of EPO upon hypoxia/ischaemia in mouse brains
indicates that EPO plays an important role in neurovascular
protection from ischaemia (Kunze et al. 2012). EPO
increases neuronal survival, fosters ischaemic tolerance
(Ruscher et al. 2002; Kumral et al. 2004; Ogunshola and
Bogdanova 2013) and increases neurogenesis and oligodendrogliosis
of subventricular zone precursor cells after
ischaemic stroke (Gonzalez et al. 2013). EPO preserves
endothelial cell integrity (Chong et al. 2002), promotes
angiogenesis (Wang et al. 2004) and protects BBB from
disruption during injury and maintains the establishment of
cell–cell junctions (Mart ınez-Estrada et al. 2003). However,
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized German
Multicentre EPO Stroke Trial (Phase II/III; ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT00604630), ischaemic stroke patients receiving
EPO did not show favourable effects (Ehrenreich et al.
2009). Therefore, unless other HIF-mediated mediators of
neuroprotection for IOX3 are detected in further studies (and
given the number of HIF target genes this is a possibility),
the observation of EPO up-regulation in isolation cannot be
used to advocate testing IOX3 as a neuroprotectant in a
clinical setting at this point in time.
Our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal similar but not
identical outcomes using IOX3 at different concentrations.
This could reflect the limited extent of our studies, or the
highly pleiotropic HIF system, or inhibition of other enzymes
in addition to the PHDs, including those inhibiting nucleic
acid demethylation (Aik et al. 2013). It is difficult to match
IOX3 concentration in vivo with that in vitro, as the former is
affected by numerous factors, including context-dependent
pharmacokinetics. Notably, 60 mg/kg is the maximal amount
of IOX3 that can be given in a single injection to a mouse
when considering the maximal volume being injected as well
as maximal concentration of the drug being dissolved. Both
the in vivo and in vitro data agree that drug application
immediately after cerebral ischaemia should be avoided.
IOX3 pre-treatment is neuroprotective partially because of
better maintaining BBB integrity during ischaemia. BBB
function and integrity contribute substantially to neuroprotection
(Gidday 2006). The BBB is rapidly affected by
ischaemia/reperfusion, and has been shown to precede
neuronal damage (Latour et al. 2004). BBB disruption in
ischaemic stroke leads to haemorrhagic transformation with
enhanced brain injury in both animals and humans (Jickling
et al. 2014). Our study suggests that HIF stabilization with
IOX3 before cerebral ischaemia is neuroprotective partially
because of BBB protection, while immediate application
could be detrimental. Indeed, we have recently shown that
immediate HIF stabilization leads to delocalization and
decreased phosphorylation of tight junctions, and compromises
barrier function (Engelhardt et al. 2014).
In vivo mouse models of cerebral ischaemia are very
sensitive to confounding changes in physiological variables
like body temperature and cerebral blood flow. Both
variables were very well controlled in our experiments,
which is the strength of the study. We did not observe any
differences in rCBF during ischaemia and reperfusion
between IOX3 and vehicle groups. While our previous study
on PHD isoform genetic modified mice found that PHD2+/
mice (PHD2 is the most important human isoform of PHD)
have more rapid rCBF return during reperfusion than wildtype
mice (Chen et al. 2012). This indicates that mechanisms
of neuroprotection in PHD2+/ mice and by IOX3 treatment
are different. This observation is important since we and
others have previously found that PHD2+/ mice have
Fig. 9 Effects of IOX3 on RBE4 monolayer
permeability. Exposure of RBE4 cells to
hypoxia (Hx+G) caused only a moderate
change in RBE4 monolayer integrity,
whereas oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD, Hx-G) significantly increased
paracellular flux by two to threefold
compared to normoxia (Nx+G). Twentyfour-hour
pre-treatment with IOX3
abrogated barrier disruption during OGD
significantly at 50 lM compared to Hx-G,

increased vessel density in organs including the brain by a
long-term response through genetic reprogramming, which
enables the body to form collateral arteries (Takeda et al.
2011; Chen et al. 2012). After MCAO, mice had hypothermia.
Hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate,
reduces infarct volume, improves neurological recovery and
hence is neuroprotective (Yenari and Han 2012). Previously,
we have reported that temperature-regulated mice had larger
infarct volumes, and worse histological and behavioural
scores compared to non-temperature-regulated mice (Barber
et al. 2004). To reduce variables that may affect the
outcomes, we have controlled the temperature through a
telemetric feedback regulated system in this study.
In conclusion, we have found that a selective HIF PHD
inhibitor, IOX3, at low concentrations protects the brain from
ischaemia/reperfusion damage when given preconditionally.
Immediate treatment before the ischaemic insult is ineffective
possibly because there is not enough time for ‘genetic
reprogramming’ which occurs on a timescale of hours to
days (Dirnaglet al.2009). Out of nine measured HIF-targets,
only EPO was found to be a potential protective effector
gene, although in addition to EPO, other HIF target genes are
likely up-regulated. IOX3 up-regulates HIF-1ain RBE4 cells
and causes significant delocalization of ZO-1 from endothelial
cell junctions with rising doses. Pre-treatment of IOX3 on
RBE4 cells prevents barrier disruption from a subsequent
OGD, while immediate application does not have the
protection. Pharmacological preconditioning with HIF PHD
inhibitors remains a promising strategy; however, further
experiments on the detailed mechanisms of neuroprotection
are needed before IOX3 is tested in a clinical setting for
prevention of ischaemic strokes. The fine regulation of the
HIF system during permanent cerebral ischaemia or ischaemia
followed by reperfusion in the setting of simultaneous
application of HIF manipulating drugs is still only poorly
understood. In the absence of a detailed molecular understanding
, one way forward will be to vary the nature and
dose of the HIF hydroxylase inhibitors used.
