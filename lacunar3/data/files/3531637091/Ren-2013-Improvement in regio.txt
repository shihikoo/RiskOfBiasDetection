Abstract
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of L-serine, permanent focal cerebral ischemia was
induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery while monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF). Rats were divided into
control and L-serine-treated groups after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neurological deficit score and brain
infarct volume were assessed. Nissl staining was used to quantify the cortical injury. L-serine and D-serine levels in the
ischemic cortex were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography. We found that L-serine treatment: 1)
reduced the neurological deficit score, infarct volume and cortical neuron loss in a dose-dependent manner; 2)
improved CBF in the cortex, and this effect was inhibited in the presence of apamin plus charybdotoxin while the
alleviation of both neurological deficit score and infarct volume was blocked; and 3) increased the amount of L-serine
and D-serine in the cortex, and inhibition of the conversion of L-serine into D-serine by aminooxyacetic acid did not
affect the reduction of neurological deficit score and infarct volume by L-serine. In conclusion, improvement in regional
CBF by L-serine may contribute to its neuroprotective effect on the ischemic brain, potentially through vasodilation
which is mediated by the small- and intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels on the cerebral blood vessel
endothelium.

Introduction
L-serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a critical role in
neuronal development and function in the central nervous system.
As well as a building block of proteins, L-serine is a crucial
neurotrophic factor and a precursor for phosphatidyl-L-serine, L-
cysteine, nucleotides, sphingolipids, and neurotransmitters such as
D-serine and glycine [1]. L-serine treatment has been used to
manage depression, schizophrenia, and chronic fatigue syndrome,
and to prevent psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, and
seizures found in people with rare congenital defects of L-serine
biosynthesis [1]. Interestingly, our previous study showed that L-
serine exerted a neuroprotective effect that was potentially
mediated by activating glycine receptors in the ischemicreperfused
brain of rats [2].
L-serine has also been shown to induce a reduction in mean
arterial pressure via endothelium-dependent vasodilatation
through the activation of apamin and charybdotoxin-sensitive
Ca2+-activated K+ (K
Ca
) channels present on the endothelium
[3,4]. Although, this vasodilating action of L-serine has not been
identified in cerebral blood vessels. However, we recently found an
elevating action of L-serine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat
after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. The present study was
carried out to clarify whether the elevation of regional CBF (rCBF)
by L-serine is mediated through the activation of apamin- and
charybdotoxin-sensitive K
Ca
channels on the endothelium and
subsequent dilation of cerebral blood vessels. We also examined
whether this vasodilating action would contribute to its neuroprotective
effect on the brain after permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) in rats.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Chemicals
Two hundred and eighty six male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighting 270610 g were used in the present study (obtained
from the Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University,
Nantong, China). All procedures were in accordance with the
institutional guidelines of Nantong University, which comply with

(BY PDF Extractor SDK TRIAL VERSION)
international rules and policies. Ethics in accordance with the
ARRIVE guidelines were followed in animal experiments and
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nantong
University, Nantong, China.
L-serine, D-serine, charybdotoxin (ChTx), orthophthalaldehyde
(OPA), aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), apamin and strychnine
hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation
(Saint Louis, MO, USA); 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC), methanol and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) from Merck
Corporation (Darmstadt, Germany); and dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) from Shenhe Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All other chemicals were from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) or Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd.
(Guangzhou, China).
Drug Administration
L-Serine was dissolved in normal saline, and used intraperitoneally
(i.p.) at an interval of 12 h for 3 days. To determine the
dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of L-serine, rats were
randomly divided into 5 groups: sham-operated, vehicle, and L-
serine 56 mg/kg, 168 mg/kg and 504 mg/kg. L-serine was
initially used at 3 h after pMCAO. The vehicle group was treated
with isodose saline. To investigate the time-window of L-serine
efficacy, rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: vehicle and 5
L-serine treated groups. Onset of L-serine use (168 mg/kg, i.p.)
was respectively at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after pMCAO.
To determine the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective
effect exerted by L-serine on the ischemic brain, L-serine
168 mg/kg was intraperitoneally used 3 h after pMCAO. A
combination of apamin and charybdotoxin (75 mg/kg of each)
were slowly infused through the internal jugular vein over a 10-
min period and 45 min before the L-serine injection to ensure that
the small- and intermediate-conductance K
Ca
(SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
)
channels were blocked. In addition, strychnine (0.42 mg/kg, i.p.),
or DMSO as a control, were used 5 min ahead of L-serine.
Strychnine was dissolved with saline containing 0.1% DMSO.
For the measurement of D-serine and L-serine concentrations,
L-serine 168 mg/kg was used intraperitoneally 3 h after pMCAO,
and the samples were obtained at different time points: 0 h
(control group, without use of L-serine), 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h
and 12 h after L-serine injection. For the observation of the
influence of AOAA on L-serine efficacy, AOAA was intraperitoneally
used at 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg 45 min ahead of the L-
serine injection.
MCAO Surgery
Rats were fasted overnight with free access to water. All animals
were anesthetized first with 2 mL enflurane and anesthetization
was maintained with 10% chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.).
Permanent MCAO was induced as reported previously [5].
Briefly, after a midline neck incision, the right common carotid
artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid
artery (ECA) were exposed, and the proximal ECA and CCA were
then ligated. The vagus nerve was carefully preserved as far as
possible. A specialized nylon suture of 0.24 mm diameter (Beijing
Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) was introduced from the lumen
of the distal CCA just before bifurcation into the ICA until
resistance was felt. Thus the origin of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was occluded by the nylon suture. The average depth of
filament insertion was 18.560.5 mm away from the bifurcation.
Then, the exposed vessels were carefully ligated to prevent
bleeding, and the incision was closed aseptically. Sham-operated
animals were subjected to the same surgical procedure, but the
suture was not advanced beyond the internal carotid bifurcation.
A laser Doppler perfusion monitor (PeriFlux System 5010,
Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to monitor rCBF
throughout the study. The ischemic model was considered
successful if about 75% reduction in CBF was induced immediately
after placement of the suture [6], otherwise the animals were
excluded. Rectal temperature of the rats was maintained at
3760.5uC using a temperature-regulated heating pad throughout
the anesthetic period including surgical preparation. After revival
from anesthesia, the animals were put back into cages with the
room temperature maintained at 2562uC. Some of the rats died
during the experiment, the mortality during the first 24 h after
pMCAO operation was 18.8% and 16.9%, and the additional
mortality until end-point was 5.5% and 5.0% respectively in the
vehicle and L-serine treated groups. Data from these animals were
excluded.
Neurological Evaluation
Neurological function was evaluated at 72 h after pMCAO and
scored on a 6-point scale [7]: 0, no neurological deficit; 1, failure to
extend left forepaw fully; 2, circling to the left; 3, inability to bear
weight on the left; 4, no spontaneous walking with depressed level
of consciousness; and 5, death.
Assessment of Infarct Size
Cerebral infarct size was assessed using the TTC staining
method [8]. Animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(500 mg/kg, i.p.) 72 h after pMCAO, and their brains were
removed and sectioned into consecutive 2 mm-thick coronal slices
using a mould (RBM-4000C, ASI Instruments, Warren, MI,
USA). The slices were immediately immersed into 1% TTC
medium at 37uC for 15 min and then turned over for another
15 min. The stained slices were washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 5 min and then fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde
solution for 24 h. At the end of staining and fixation, color images
of these slices were captured using a video camera (PowerShot
S60, Canon, Tokyo, Japan). The infarct volume was analyzed
using Image Pro Plus software. Percentage infarct volume was
calculated as follows: [(V
C
–V
L
)/2V
C
]6100, where V
C
is the
volume of control hemisphere (left side), V
L
the volume of noninfarcted
tissue in the lesioned hemisphere (right side).
Nissl Staining
72 h after pMCAO, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate (500 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused with 250 mL of normal

0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). Rat brain was removed and then post-fixed
for 24 h in the same fixative. The post-fixed brain tissue was cryoprotected
in 20% then 30% sucrose in PBS. The brain tissue was
then sectioned coronally 20 mm in thickness with a cryostat slicer
(CM1900, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). The sections from bregma
22.60 mm to 23.2 mm were prepared, mounted with neutral
balata (Shanghai Specimen and Model Factory, Shanghai, China)

and blotted onto slides, and then covered with a coverslip after
Nissl staining, which was performed as reported previously [2].
After Nissl staining, neuronal cells in the cortex of the infarct
area were identified under a high-magnification (6400) light
microscope and counted by an investigator blinded to the
grouping. For each rat, the mean number of neurons was
obtained by examining three serial coronal sections. In each
section, the number of neurons was averaged from three different
vision fields of the cortex. Only intact neurons with a clearly
defined cell body and nucleus were counted.
High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
Analysis
We used the method described by Kiya et al. [9]. Rats were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg). Blood drawn
from right ventricle was dissolved in physiological saline containing
1.12 mg/mL ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid-2Na (EDTA-
2Na), the volume of which was nine times as much as blood. The
blood samples were then centrifuged at 15,0006g for 10 min at
4uC to obtain the plasma. At the same time, the ischemic cortex
was rapidly harvested and frozen at 280uC together with the
plasma. The cortex was homogenized in methanol on ice using an
ultrasonic cell crusher. The volume (mL) of methanol added was
equivalent to the weight (mg) of the brain. The plasma was diluted
99-fold in methanol. The brain homogenates and diluted plasma
were then centrifuged at 15,0006g for 10 min at 4uC. The
supernatants were mixed with isometric 5 mM OPA/NAC
solution. After standing at room temperature for 2 min, 20 mlof
the reaction mixture was injected into an HPLC system
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Samples and standard solutions were
automatically derivatized and injected onto the HPLC system.
Diastereomeric derivatives of D-serine and L-serine in OPA/NAC
were separated on a C18 chromatographic column, and the
fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of
340 nm and an emission wavelength of 445 nm. A mixture of 18%
(v/v) methanol and 82% (v/v) 0.1M PBS (pH 6.0) containing
5 mg/L EDTA-2Na was used as the mobile phase. After elution of
D- and L-serine derivatives, late eluting peaks were flushed out
with a mixture of 80% methanol and 20% 0.05M PBS (pH 6.0)
containing 5 mg/L EDTA-2Na. The mobile phase flow rate was
set at 1 mL/min, and the column temperature was set at 30uC.
Measurement of rCBF and Other Physiological
Parameters
According to the literature [6], CBF and brain tissue oxygen
saturation (SbtO
2
) were continuously monitored with a laser
Doppler perfusion monitor (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed) and
the moorVMS-OXYTM system (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK).
Briefly, a sagittal skin incision about 1.5 cm long was made.
Scanning probes (407-1, Perimed; CP2T-1000, Moor Instruments)
were carefully placed on the skull ipsilateral to the pMCAO under
a stereotaxic device (51653, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA)
with its center at 5 mm lateral to midline and 1 mm posterior to
bregma, thus avoiding any large vessel. After successful operation,
the rats were continually kept anesthetized to detect the influence
of L-serine on CBF and SbtO
2
in the ischemic cortex. The basal
level of rCBF prior to pMCAO was assigned a value of 100%, and
the rCBF levels under other conditions were calculated as percent
values relative to the basal level. Mean values of SbtO
2
were
obtained by calculating the average level of 5 min monitoring
before pMCAO, 30 min after pMCAO and 30 min after use of L-
serine or vehicle.
To verify the change in rCBF detected with the laser Doppler
perfusion monitor, cerebral perfusion imaging of rat brain was
performed using computed tomograph (CT) perfusion imaging
technique. The anesthetization of rats was maintained with 10%
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.). L-serine (168 mg/kg) or the
equal volume of vehicle (normal saline) was injected intraperitoneally
30 min after pMCAO. One hour later, non-enhanced CT
scans were continuously carried out using the Philips Brilliance 64
CT scanner (Royal Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, Netherlands)

with a bolus injection of 2 ml ioversol 320 through tail vein at a
rate of 0.3 ml/s at the start of scan (slice thickness 2.5 mm, 80 kV,
100 mA, scan speed 1 slice/s). The layer with maximal ischemic
area was selected for the comparison of CBF relative to the nonischemic
side of the brain. Relative CBF of the region of interest
was calculated by the software of the CT system. Other three
parameters of relative cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit
time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) were simultaneously obtained
according to the literature [10,11].
During the measurement of rCBF, transcutaneous partial
pressure of O
2
(tcPO
2
) was simultaneously monitored from the
hip skin of the rat using a probe (E5250, Perimed) [12]. Blood
pressure and heart rate were simultaneously measured with a
caudal artery pressure measuring system (Alcott Biotech Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai, China).

Statistics
Data are presented as the mean6 standard error. Neurological
deficit score data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis ranksum
test and the Extended t-test for post hoc comparisons. Data
from multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and
Scheffe ´’s test for post hoc comparisons. Data of cerebral L-serine
and D-serine content were analyzed using two-way ANOVA
followed by one-way ANOVA for the same treatments, and
Student’s t-test for two different treatments at the same time point.
Differences with P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Monitoring Physiological Parameters
Blood pressure, heart rate and tcPO
2
were monitored; however,
no notable influence was observed after the use of L-serine,
apamin plus ChTx, or a combination of L-serine and apamin plus
ChTx (Table 1).
Dose-dependent Neuroprotective Effect of L-serine
A dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of L-serine was
examined in rats 72 h after pMCAO. The neurological function
72 h after pMCAO was reduced with an elevation in the
neurological deficit score (Fig. 1A), and an infarct was induced
with a volume of 410.668.6 mm3 (Fig. 1B–C). However, L-serine
treatment alleviated the neurological deficit score and infarct
volume in a dose-dependent manner: i.e. L-serine at 56 mg/kg
had no affect (p.0.05); at 168 mg/kg, the neurological deficit
score was significantly reduced by L-serine from the control value
of 2.5060.22 to 1.1760.31 (p,0.01), and the infarct volume from
29.060.8% to 21.461.5% (p,0.01). A higher dose of L-serine
(504 mg/kg) further reduced the neurological deficit score and
infarct volume, but the reductions were not significantly different
from those of the 168 mg/kg group (p.0.05, Fig. 1A–B).
Using Nissl staining, a severe neuronal loss in the parietal cortex
ipsilateral to pMCAO was found (2063.4 vs. 10965.0 for shamoperated
rats, Fig. 1D and E). L-Serine treatment after pMCAO
significantly inhibited the decrease in neuronal number; the mean
value was increased to 6869.0 and 7067.0 in the 168 mg/kg and
504 mg/kg groups respectively (p,0.01, Fig. 1D). No noticeable
differences in the number of neurons were noted between these
two doses (p.0.05, Fig. 1D). Therefore, we selected the 168 mg/
kg dose for the following experiments.
Time-window of L-serine Efficacy
To observe the time window of L-serine efficacy, L-serine
(168 mg/kg, i.p.) was used at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h or 24 h after
pMCAO and repeated every 12 h for 3 days. The neurological
function and infarct volume were determined 72 h after pMCAO.
As shown in Fig. 2, first treatment of L-serine conducted at 1 h,
3 h or 6 h after pMCAO exerted a prominent neuroprotective
effect in contrast to that at 12 or 24 h after pMCAO: i.e. first
treatment of L-serine at 1 h, 3 h or 6 h after pMCAO decreased
both the neurological deficit score and infarct volume notably
(p,0.01 or 0.05), but that at 24 h after pMCAO did not (p.0.05).
First use of L-serine at 12 h after pMCAO reduced only the
neurological deficit score (p,0.01), but not the infarct volume
(p.0.05, Fig. 2).
Increase in rCBF by L-serine and the Underlying
Mechanisms
To investigate the potential mechanism of the neuroprotective
effect exerted by L-serine, we measured the CBF of the cortex with
the laser Doppler perfusion monitor. L-serine treatment (168 mg/
kg) did not change CBF of the cortex ipsilateral to the ischemic
side in the sham-operated rat (Fig. 3A–a), but elevated CBF of the
ischemic cortex in the pMCAO rat (Fig. 3A–c); the mean value
increased from 23.560.9% to 37.761.6% (p,0.01, Fig. 3B).
Similar increase in the rCBF of the ischemic side of rat brain
after use of L-serine (168 mg/kg) was also detected by CT
perfusion imaging technique (p,0.05, Fig. 3C and D). Moreover,
the influence of L-serine on rCBF in a mouse pMCAO model was
investigated using the laser speckle technique (see ). Likewise,
intraperitoneal use of L-serine (268 mg/kg) increased rCBF of the
ischemic brain of mice at 55 min after pMCAO (p,0.01, see
Figure S1).
Similar to change in the rCBF, cortical SbtO
2
was reduced
markedly in the rat after pMCAO (Table 2). However, SbtO
2
was
increased by 16.162.97% after the use of L-serine (168 mg/kg,
i.p., p,0.01, Table 2).
To investigate whether elevation of rCBF by L-serine was
mediated through opening SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels on the
vascular endothelium, we infused apamin plus ChTx (both 75 mg/
kg) to block these channels in vivo [3,4]. Intravenous use of apamin
and ChTx did not exert significant influence on rCBF by
themselves (Fig. 4A–b), but blocked the elevating effect of L-serine
on rCBF (Fig. 4A–d). The mean value of rCBF was reduced from
36.861.0% in the L-serine group to 26.361.4% in the
apamin+ChTx+L-serine group (p,0.01, Fig. 4B).
To exclude the possibility that the effect of L-serine on rCBF
was mediated through activating glycine receptors, we used
strychnine (i.p.), a glycine receptor antagonist, at a subconvulsant
dose of 0.42 mg/kg [13,14]. As shown in Fig. 5A, strychnine did
not exert any significant influence on the effect of L-serine. Mean
values of rCBF in L-serine, DMSO and strychnine groups were
37.661.5%, 35.661.2% and 37.561.9%, respectively (p.0.05,
Fig. 5B).
Blunting of the Neuroprotective Effect of L-serine by
Apamin Plus ChTx
To verify the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect
of L-serine in rats, we carried out further studies using apamin and
ChTx. The neurological deficit score in the apamin+ChTx group
was a little higher than that of the vehicle group, but not significant
(p.0.05, Fig. 6A). However, pretreatment of apamin and ChTx
blunted the reducing effect of L-serine on the neurological deficit
score (Fig. 6A). A similar result was detected for the infarct volume
(Fig. 6B and 6C); i.e. in the presence of apamin and ChTx, the
reducing effect of L-serine on the infarct volume was also blunted,
the mean value of which was raised from 23.761.0% to
29.161.1% (p,0.05, Fig. 6B).

Measurement of L-serine and D-serine Concentrations in
the Brain
Ischemic rats were injected with L-serine (168 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 h
after MCAO. Normal rats received the same treatment. Samples
of blood and ischemic cortex were harvested at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h,
3 h, 6 h and 12 h after L-serine injection.
As shown in Fig. 7A, after L-serine treatment, the concentration
of L-serine in the blood raised rapidly; the peak level
(19.5960.88 mmol/mL) appeared at 1 h after L-serine injection
(p,0.01), and then the concentration of L-serine decreased with
time.
The concentration of L-serine in the ischemic cortex significant
increased, similar to that seen in blood. After 1-h delay, the peak
level was reached at 2 h after L-serine injection, being several
times more than the vehicle group (0 h) (6.8560.30 vs.
1.5260.04 mmol/g, p,0.01, Fig. 7B). The L-serine level at 12 h
after injection (3.5660.22 mmol/g) was still significantly higher
than that of the vehicle group (p,0.01). However, L-serine levels
in the brain of normal rats increased slowly; the peak level was
reached at 3 h after L-serine injection (2.8360.09 mmol/g,
p,0.05), and then the concentration of L-serine decreased rapidly
to the basal level (Fig. 7B).
Moreover, the concentration of D-serine in the ischemic cortex
was also increased after L-serine treatment, but in a different
pattern (Fig. 7C); i.e. D-serine level increased gradually with a
peak concentration at 6 h after L-serine injection (0.7560.04 vs.
0.3260.01 mmol/g of vehicle group, p,0.01). However, the D-
serine level in normal rats was not markedly increased after L-
serine treatment (p.0.05, Fig. 7C).
Influence of AOAA on the Neuroprotective Effect of L-
serine
It has been reported that pyridoxal 59-phosphate-dependent
serine racemase converts L-serine into D-serine [15] which is a
potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor co-agonist [16].
AOAA is a potent inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent
enzymes [17]. Because the above HPLC results showed that L-
serine was partly converted into D-serine, AOAA was used ahead
of the L-serine injection to see whether converted D-serine would
affect the neuroprotective effect of L-serine. Nevertheless, the
effects of L-serine on both the neurological deficit score and infarct
volume were not altered significantly by AOAA (p.0.05, Fig. 8A–
C).
Discussion
The present study found that L-serine used after pMCAO
reduced the neurological deficit, infarct volume and cortical
neuronal loss in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting
that L-serine can exert a neuroprotective effect on the brain in
permanent cerebral ischemic rats. These results extend and are
consistent with our previous observation on the effect of L-serine
in ischemic/reperfused rat after MCAO [2].
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective
effect of L-serine, rCBF was monitored before and after pMCAO
and after use of L-serine. Surprisingly, we found that L-serine did
not influence CBF of normal rats, but improved CBF and oxygen
saturation of the ischemic cortex in pMCAO rats. This increase in
the CBF of ischemic brain after L-serine treatment was also
detected in the pMCAO mice. We suggest that the neuroprotective
effect of L-serine may be mediated, at least partly, by
improving CBF of the ischemic brain, a finding which has not
been reported previously. This is a novel mechanism of the
neuroprotective effect of L-serine apart from the glycine receptormediated
mechanism we reported previously [2].
Because glycine receptors were involved in mediating the
neuroprotective effect of L-serine, as we reported previously [2],
strychnine, an antagonist of glycine receptors, was applied before
using L-serine. The elevating effect of L-serine on rCBF was not

rCBF is not mediated by glycine receptors.
The vascular endothelium controls vessel tone by releasing
nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, as well as by a third pathway
involving endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF)
[16]. EDHF-mediated processes involve an increase in the
intracellular calcium concentration, opening of the endothelial
SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels and hyperpolarization of the endothelial
cells [18]. The role of EDHF is negligible in the aorta, accounts for
about half of the total vasodilatory response in carotid arteries with
a diameter less than 500 mm, and seems to be predominant in
arterioles (,100 mm) [18,19]. McNeish et al. have confirmed
SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels present on the endothelium of the rat
MCA, and both IK
Ca
and SK
Ca
channels are involved in the
hyperpolarizing responses of the rat MCA [20]. Cipolla et al. have
found that SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channel activity could diminish the
basal tone of the cerebral parenchymal arterioles (PA), but not
MCA, and the EDHF responsiveness of PA after ischemia/
reperfusion may be preserved and have an important role in
vasodilation under the conditions when NO synthase has been
inhibited [19]. Moreover, Hannah et al. have reported that both
SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels conduct the outward current in isolated
PA endothelial cells, and blockade of SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels in
PA will decrease the resting cortical CBF by,15% while opening
the channels increased CBF by ,40% [21]. Similarly, Mishra
et al. have found that L-serine could evoke a rapid, reversible,
dose-dependent vasodilatation of the third-order branches of
mesenteric arterioles by activating SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels
without increasing the heart rate, and this effect is more
pronounced in NO synthase-blunted rats than in control rats
[3]. In areas where ischemic CBF is,30% of pre-occlusion values,
auto-regulation is completely lost, but the EDHF-mediated
mechanism continues to function [22]. We did not detect any
significant effect of L-serine on CBF in normal rats, possibly
because normal auto-regulation keeps CBF constant in nonischemic
rats.
For these reasons, we supposed that L-serine might improve
CBF in the ischemic area through opening SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels. In order to confirm this, we carried out further studies.
According to the method described by Mishra et al. [3,4], we used
apamin and ChTx to block both SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels.
Surprisingly, the effect of L-serine enhancing blood flow in the
ischemic cortex was blocked, suggesting that L-serine may induce
vasodilation in ischemic brain tissue to elevate rCBF through
SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels on the endothelial cells of cerebral blood
vessels.
To clarify whether this vasodilating action contributes to the
neuroprotective effect of L-serine, an additional experiment was
carried out. With pretreatment of SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels
blockers, the reducing effect of L-serine on the neurological deficit
score and infarct volume was significantly reduced, suggesting that
the neuroprotective effect of L-serine may be partly due to an
increase in rCBF in the ischemic brain through a vasodilating
action mediated by SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels.
D-serine is an important co-agonist for NMDA receptors at the
glycine-binding site and necessary for glutamatergic neurotransmission
in many neurophysiological processes [16]. Overstimulation
of NMDA receptors causing neuronal damage contributes to
many neuropathological conditions, including acute cerebral
ischemia [23,24]. Hardingham et al. have identified that the
synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors have the opposite
effects on cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elementbinding
protein function, gene regulation and neuronal survival
[25]. Activation of the synaptic NMDA receptors has antiapoptotic
activity, whereas stimulation of the extrasynaptic

NMDA receptors causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
and cell death [25].
To exclude an involvement of D-serine-related mechanisms in
the neuroprotective effect of L-serine, the concentrations of L-
serine and D-serine in the ischemic cortex and blood were
measured. After intraperitoneal injection of L-serine, the blood
level increased rapidly; after a 1 h delay the cortical level of L-
serine in the ischemic side also reached a peak that was several
times higher than the control. However, L-serine levels in the
cortex of normal rats were not significantly elevated. The bloodbrain
barrier may be more permeable to L-serine under ischemic
conditions. Therefore, with the help of serine racemase, D-serine
levels in the ischemic cortex was elevated after injection of L-
serine, although the peak level was reached with an additional 4 h
delay and the amplitude was smaller than that seen with L-serine.
These results are consistent with previous reports [26,27].
However, we found that pretreatment of AOAA did not affect
the recovery of neurological behaviors and the infarct volume of
the brain in pMCAO rats treated with L-serine, suggesting that
conversion of L-serine into D-serine by serine racemase in the
brain may be not involved in the neuroprotective effect of L-
serine.
In conclusion, L-serine treatment in pMCAO rats exerted a
neuroprotective effect on the ischemic brain, at least partly due to
an increase in rCBF through vasodilation mediated by the SK
Ca
and IK
Ca
channels on cerebral blood vessel endothelial cells.
Activation of glycine receptors was not involved in this vasodilating
action of L-serine, and neither was the neuroprotective effect
of L-serine related to the conversion of L-serine into D-serine by
serine racemase (Fig. 9).

mixture under spontaneous breathing. With the mouse in a prone
position fixed in a head holder (SG-4N, Narishige Co., Ltd.), the
scalp was shaved and cut meticulously with a surgical knife to
expose the thin skull over the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar
hemispheres without causing brain trauma. The baseline CBF
values were recorded for 5 minute by using the laser speckle
technique (Stetler et al., 2012). Briefly, a CCD camera (PeriCam
PSI System; Perimed) was positioned above the head, and a laser
diode (785 nm) illuminated the intact skull surface to allow
penetration of the laser in a diffuse manner through the brain.
Speckle contrast (defined as the ratio of the SD of pixel intensity to
the mean pixel intensity) was used to measure CBF as it is derived
from the speckle visibility relative to the velocity of the lightscattering
particles (blood). This was then converted to correlation
time values, which are inversely and linearly proportional to the
mean blood velocity. The mouse was then placed supine, and
ischemia was induced. The rectal temperature was controlled at
37.060.5uC during surgery with a feedback regulated heating pad.
After exposing the right carotid artery, a 5-0 silk suture was
advanced into the internal carotid artery 12 mm from the lumen
of the external carotid artery. The ipsilateral common carotid
artery was occluded with a small surgical clip immediately after
suture blockade. The animals underwent MCA occlusion
permanently. L-serine of 268 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected
30 min after pMCAO. Laser speckle perfusion images were
obtained every 7.5 s, continuing throughout 90 min after
pMCAO. CBF was analyzed two dimensionally over time by
quantifying the area of infarct. The relative CBF was then
reported as the ratio of baseline for each animal. Student’s t-test
was used for the statistical analysis of results from vehicle group
and L-serine treated group (6 mice for each group).
