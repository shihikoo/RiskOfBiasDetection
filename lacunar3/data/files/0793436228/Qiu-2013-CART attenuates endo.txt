a b s t r a c t 
Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART), a neuropeptide, has shown strong neuroprotective
effects against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo and in vitro. Here, we report a
new effect of CART on ER stress which is induced by cerebral I/R in a rat model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) or by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in cultured cortical neurons, as well as a
new functionality of BDNF in the neuroprotection by CART against the ER stress in cerebral I/R. The
results showed that CART was effective in reducing the neuronal apoptosis and expression of ER stress
markers (GRP78, CHOP and cleaved caspase12), and increasing the BDNF expression in I/R injury rat cortex
both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the effects of CART on ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis and
ER stress were suppressed by tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) IgG, whereas the effects of CART on BDNF
transcription, synthesis and secretion were abolished by CREB siRNA. This work suggests that CART is
functional in inhibiting the cerebral I/R-induced ER stress and neuronal apoptosis by facilitating the transcription
, synthesis and secretion of BDNF in a CREB-dependent way.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common
pathophysiological process in stroke [1]. Growing evidences demonstrate
that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, glucoseregulated
protein 78 (GRP78), CATT/EBP homologous protein
(CHOP), eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and caspase12 are
remarkably activated after cerebral I/R injury[2–6], and the inhibition
of ER stress, either deletion of CHOP [7] or inhibition of eIF2a
dephosphorylation [8], can attenuate the cerebral I/R injury.
A neuropeptide, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript
(CART) is proven to show strong neuroprotective effects against
the cerebral ischemic injury both in vivo and in vitro [9–12]. However
, it has not been yet investigated whether CART can attenuate
the ischemic neuronal injury by inhibiting the ER stress.
Our previous data have demonstrated that brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) can mediate the functioning of CART on the
survival of primary cultured hippocampal neurons [13], while it
still remains unclarified whether BNDF can contribute to the neuroprotective
effect of CART against ER stress response during cerebral
I/R.
In this study, we investigated the effect of CART on the ER stress
induced by cerebral I/R in rat or oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD) in cultured cortical neurons, and explored the role of BDNF
in neuroprotection of CART against the cerebral I/R-induced ER
stress.

2.2. Animals
Pregnant Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats and SD male rats (280–
300 g) were obtained from the Department of Laboratory Animal
Science of Peking University Health Science Center (Beijing, China).
All animal care and use protocols as set out in the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University were
followed.
2.3. Transient MCAO model and measurement of infarct volume
The transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model
was performed using the intraluminal suture technique as previously
described [18]. The CART, dissolved in 0.5 ml normal saline
and dosed by 1 nM/kg, was administered through vena caudalis
after onset of ischemia. Normal saline was given to sham and
MCAO rats. The infarct volume is expressed as the percentage of
(volume of unlesion hemisphereuninfarct volume of lesion
hemisphere) per volume of unlesion hemisphere.
2.4. Primary cortical neuron cultures
Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from the
cortex of E18 rat embryos following previously described with
minor modification[13]. The cells were plated on the poly-L-lysine
coated dishes at the density of 70,000 cells/cm2 and cultured at
37C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO
2
. After
4 h of attachment, the medium was totally changed to neurobasal
medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 1% L-glutamine. Afterwards
, the medium was half replaced by neurobasal medium supplemented
with B27 and L-glutamine every 3 days. Cultures were
used at Day 7 in vitro.
2.5. Oxygen and glucose deprivation
Cultured rat cortical neurons were incubated with DMEM without
glucose at 37C for 4 h in an anaerobic jar (UniTech Bioscience,
Guangzhou) that is supplemented with a humidified gas mixture
containing 95% N
2
and 5% CO
2
. After 4 h of OGD, the medium
was replaced by neurobasal medium and cells were further incubated
at 37C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO
2
with different
times of reoxygenation for individual experiments. For control
experiments, cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS in a normoxic
(21% O
2
) environment at 37C and replaced by neurobasal
medium after 4 h. The CART and the antagonists were maintained
before and during the OGD injury, depending on each experiment.
2.6. siRNA transfection
Seven days after plating, the cell culture medium was replaced
by the OPTI-MEM I medium for 12 h and the neurons were
transfected with siRNA in a final concentration of 50 nM using Turbofect
siRNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The rat CREB siRNA was purchased from GenePharma
(Shanghai), with the oligonucleotide sequences as follows: CREB
siRNA, sense 50-GCCAAGGAUUGAAGAAGAATT-30, antisense 50-UUCUUCUUCAAUCCUUGGCTT-30; scrambled siRNA, sense 50-UUCUCC
GAACGUGUCACGUTT-30, antisense 50-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-30.
2.7. Measurement of cell apoptosis by flow cytometry
Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using dead cell
apoptosis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After the
treatment as indicated in each experiment, which was followed
by OGD for 4 h and reoxygen for 24 h, the neurons were harvested
and incubated with annexin V and PI. Then stained cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
2.8. Western blotting analysis
The cortex tissue in peri-infarct (penumbra) or cortical neurons
were harvested on ice in a lysis buffer plus 1 mM PMSF and 1:100
volume of halt protease inhibitor cocktail. The protein (25lg) was
separated by SDS–PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The
membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris buffer saline
(TBS) Tween-20 for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4C with
the primary antibody. The blots, after being washed with TBST,
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:6000) for 1 h at room temperature, whereas
ECL reagent kits were used for protein detection. The signals were
quantified using quantity one (Bio-Rad), and the values were normalized
to a-tubulin signal and presented as the mean ± SEM.

3. Results
3.1. CART attenuates ER stress response, reduces infarct volume and
promotes BDNF expression in rat brain of MCAO
The ER stress response, BDNF expression and neuroprotective
effect of CART were observed in rat brain during I/R injury. Western
blotting results indicated that MCAO significantly increased
the expression of GRP78, CHOP and cleaved-caspase12 compared
with Sham group. However, treatment with CART inhibited the
high expression of these three ER molecules (Fig. 1A). With regards
to the cerebral infarct volume, it was induced in MCAO group
(63.29% ± 3.03%, P< 0.001 vs. Sham). CART treatment dramatically
decreased the volume induced by MCAO (29.24% ± 3.49%, P< 0.001
vs. MCAO) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, an increase in BDNF expression was
observed in cortical tissues in both of the MCAO (2.15 ± 0.75-fold,
P< 0.05) and the CART group (3.44 ± 0.69-fold, P< 0.01) compared
with Sham group, but the expression between the CART and the
MCAO group reached significantly difference (P< 0.05, Fig. 1C).
3.2. CART attenuates ER stress response, inhibits apoptosis and
promotes BDNF expression in OGD treated rat cortical neurons
To investigate the neuroprotective effect of CART on OGD induced
injury, cortical neurons were treated with different doses

of CART for 30 min, followed by exposure to OGD for 4 h and reoxygen
for 24 h. The MTT results showed that cell viability was significantly
reduced by OGD, which was inhibited by both 1 and 10 nM
CART (data not shown). Therefore, the 10 nM of CART was used in
the subsequent experiments. Western blotting results showed that
OGD induced a higher expression of GRP78, CHOP and cleaved-caspase12
, while the CART pretreatment attenuated the expression of
three ER stress markers (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the neuronal apoptosis
was significantly induced by OGD, but inhibited by CART pretreatment
(Fig. 2B). In addition, the BDNF expression was much higher
in CART pretreated group than in OGD group (Fig. 2C).
3.3. BDNF mediates the inhibitory effects of CART on OGD-induced ER
stress and apoptosis
To verify the role of BDNF on the ER stress inhibition by CART,
the BDNF receptor (tyrosine receptor kinase B) antibody (TrkB
IgG, 5lg/ml) was used to block the function of BDNF receptor.
The results showed that CART treatment inhibited the expression
of ER stress markers, which was blocked by TrkB IgG (Fig. 3A),
and the anti-apoptosis effect of CART was also abolished by TrkB
IgG (Fig. 3B).
3.4. CREB mediates the effect of CART on BDNF upregulation
CREB siRNA or scrambled siRNA were transfected into neurons,
aiming to verify whether cAMP-response element binding protein
(CREB) mediated the BDNF upregulation induced by CART or not. In
our previous work, BDNF mRNA reached the peak at 8 h and BNDF
protein at 12 h after treatment of CART. Therefore, the mRNA was
collected after treatment of OGD for 4 h and reoxygen for 4 h, and
the protein and the culture medium were harvested after

treatment of OGD for 4 h and reoxygen for 8 h, the same as previous
work. The data revealed that the protein level of CREB was
inhibited by CREB siRNA (Fig. 4B). Besides, the BDNF mRNA level
(Fig. 4A) and protein level both in cells (Fig. 4B) and medium
(Fig. 4C) were decreased in CREB siRNA transfected neurons with
or without CART treatment, while scrambled siRNA had no effect.
4. Discussion
The ER stress is a pathological process of imbalance in ER
homeostasis and physical function disorder [14]. The three ER
stress markers, GRP78, CHOP, and caspase12, are activated during
ER stress [15]. A growing body of evidence suggested that the ER
stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury [2,6,8,16]. In present study, we found that CART significantly
downregulated the expression of GRP78 and CHOP, and inhibited
the cleavage of caspase12 both in vivo and in vitro. Our results
strongly support the finding that CART inhibited ER stress response
and reduced neuronal apoptosis during cerebral I/R. It has been
known that BDNF, a member of neurotrophin family, plays a beneficial
role in stroke [17–19]. Recent studies indicate that CART
promotes the survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation
through BDNF upregulation [13,20–22]. However, it has not been
investigated as to whether the BNDF mediated the protective effect
of CART against ER stress during cerebral I/R. Our results showed
that CART significantly promoted the expression of BDNF in vivo
andin vitro. Although the expression of BDNF was lightly increased
in rat brain with MCAO and OGD-treated neurons, it was not enough
to provide neuroprotection against neuronal injury. The present
results also indicated that the inhibitory effects of CART on
OGD-induced ER stress and apoptosis in cortical neurons were
blocked by antibody to the BDNF receptor (TrkB). These data suggest
that BDNF mediated the neuroprotective effect of CART. Since
the transcription factor CREB is involved in BDNF production in
neurons [23,24], it is possible that the BDNF upregulation by CART
is CREB-dependent. Our results indicate that pre-treatment with
CREB siRNA significantly suppressed CART-induced BDNF in cultured
cortical neurons.
Taken together, the present data suggest that CART inhibited
cerebral I/R-induced ER stress and neuronal apoptosis by upregulating
BDNF in a CREB-dependent way. These findings have provided
a new sight in molecular mechanism on the
neuroprotective effect of CART on brain ischemia.
