Background Intracranial pressure elevation, peaking three to
seven post-stroke is well recognized following large strokes.
Data following small–moderate stroke are limited. Therapeutic
hypothermia improves outcome after cardiac arrest, is strongly
neuroprotective in experimental stroke, and is under clinical
trial in stroke. Hypothermia lowers elevated intracranial pressure
; however, rebound intracranial pressure elevation and
neurological deterioration may occur during rewarming.
Hypotheses (1) Intracranial pressure increases 24 h after moderate
and small strokes. (2) Short-duration hypothermiarewarming
, instituted before intracranial pressure elevation,
prevents this 24 h intracranial pressure elevation.
Methods Long-Evans rats with two hour middle cerebral
artery occlusion or outbred Wistar rats with three hour middle
cerebral artery occlusion had intracranial pressure measured at
baseline and 24 h. Wistars were randomized to 2·5 h hypothermia
(32·5°C) or normothermia, commencing 1 h after stroke.
Results In Long-Evans rats (n = 5), intracranial pressure
increased from 10·9 ± 4·6 mmHg at baseline to 32·4 ±
11·4 mmHg at 24 h, infarct volume was 84·3 ± 15·9 mm3. In 
normothermic Wistars (n = 10), intracranial pressure increased
from 6·7 ± 2·3 mmHg to 31·6 ± 9·3 mmHg, infarct volume was
31·3 ± 18·4 mm3. In hypothermia-treated Wistars (n = 10), 24 h
intracranial pressure did not increase (7·0 ± 2·8 mmHg,
P < 0·001 vs. normothermia), and infarct volume was smaller
(15·4 ± 11·8 mm3, P < 0·05).
Conclusions We saw major intracranial pressure elevation 24 h
after stroke in two rat strains, even after small strokes. Shortduration
hypothermia prevented the intracranial pressure rise,
an effect sustained for at least 18 h after rewarming. The
findings have potentially important implications for design of
future clinical trials.

Introduction
Stroke remains the third leading cause of death and a major cause
of morbidity worldwide (1). Clearly, better widely applicable
acute therapies are needed. Catastrophic intracranial pressure
(ICP) elevation has been associated with death in large acute
stroke (2,3). However, the association between size of stroke and
degree of ICP elevation is not strong (4). Typically in large strokes,
ICP peaks between two to five days post-stroke (2). Data on ICP
in small stroke in humans are not available. In experimental
stroke, there are surprisingly little data available on ICP changes;
however, the work of Kotwica et al. (1991) (5) suggests that an
initial ICP peak at 24 h is seen after both medium and large
strokes (relative infarct size, % hemisphere, in large stroke:
25–36%, in small stroke: 9–15%). In the larger strokes, ICP had a
secondary peak at three to four days, whereas in the mediumsized
strokes, it normalized over this period.
Hypothermia results in reduction of ICP, and it has been used
to achieve therapeutic ICP reduction in stroke, traumatic brain
injury, and hepatic encephalopathy (6–8). A major limitation to
hypothermia therapy is that rewarming after 12–72 h of cooling,
often results in rebound ICP elevation with subsequent neurological
deterioration. This is more prevalent with rapid rewarming
(9). Consequently, most protocols rewarm over ≥12 h (10,11).
However, prolonging the duration a patient is exposed to hypothermia
increases the risk of adverse effects such as immunosuppression
and pneumonia (9).
Therapeutic mild–moderate hypothermia is also a proven neuroprotective
therapy in human global brain ischemia – post
cardiac arrest and neonatal hypoxia ischemia (12–14); however,
benefit has not yet been proven in focal brain ischemia (stroke).
Importantly, hypothermia appears to have the strongest evidence
base of any neuroprotective strategy in experimental stroke (15).
However, clinical trials have been hampered by the logistical challenges
of prolonged cooling (12–72 h) in stroke patients and concerns
about iatrogenic complications (16). This extensive cooling
period largely limits its use to centers with available intensive care
facilities. In stark contrast to the clinical literature, the majority of
studies in experimental stroke induce hypothermia for three
hours or less (17). Somewhat surprisingly, there are very little data
regarding the effect of hypothermia on ICP in experimental
stroke.
Preliminary studies in our laboratory to investigate rebound
ICP elevation following hypothermia treatment of stroke revealed
some unanticipated results, leading to the hypotheses that:
(1) ICP rises consistently at 24 h after any stroke, not only after
large hemispheric stroke, and (2) a brief period of body cooling
commenced soon after stroke may prevent subsequent ICP

elevation. Our aims were to measure ICP 24 h after stroke in two
different rat strains and to determine the effect of a short duration
of moderate hypothermia on ICP, and infarct and edema volumes
24 h post-stroke.
Materials and methods
Animals
Surgery was performed on male Long-Evans (n = 6, Client Service
Centre, Monash University) and outbred Wistar rats (n = 37,
Animal Services Unit, University of Newcastle) weighing 290–
450 g. All experimental animal procedures used in this project
were in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the
Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and were
approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University
of Newcastle.
Experimental protocols
A small study (Part I) was conducted in Long-Evans rats, a strain
that has large infarcts with this model, to investigate the effect of
two hour temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) on
ICP. Since similar ICP effects were seen with small and large
infarcts, for ethical reasons, we conducted pilot studies in Wistar
rats, which have much smaller strokes. These data showed a
similar dramatic ICP rise with smaller strokes than the Long-
Evans (data not shown). Because similar results were obtained in
Wistars, the prospective studies of the effects of hypothermia on
ICP were performed in this strain (Part II).
ICP was monitored at baseline, during stroke surgery, and
again at 24 h post-stroke before sacrifice for histology. Infarct
volume in Wistar rats is known to be dependent on the supplier
(18–20), and our previous data show small lesion sizes using rats
from our supplier, even with permanent arterial occlusion
(114 ± 50 mm3) (20,21). Therefore, this strain was used to determine
ICP following small strokes and the effects of shortduration
hypothermia. Randomization to hypothermia, or
normothermia under anesthetic, was performed one hour after
stroke surgery in Wistar rats.
Anesthesia and monitoring
Anesthetic and surgical protocols were as previously reported
(21). In brief, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction
, 2% maintenance) in 60: 40%, N
2
:O
2
. Incision sites were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 2 mg/kg 0·05% Bupivacaine
(Pfizer, Sydney, Australia). Core body temperature was regulated
via a thermocouple rectal probe (RET-2, Physitemp Instruments
Inc, Clifton, New Jersey, USA) and warming plate (HP-1M,
Physitemp Instruments Inc). Temperature was also recorded every
five minutes for 24 h post-stroke using a datalogger (SubCue,
Calgary, Canada) inserted into the peritoneal cavity at the beginning
of the surgery. Blood gases were monitored periodically from
0·1 ml blood samples taken from a right femoral arterial line. This
line was also used for arterial blood pressure monitoring. Prior to
recovery, an additional Bupivacaine injection (0·3 ml 0·05%, s.c)
and rectal Panadol (250 mg/kg; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK)
were administered for overnight pain relief and saline was administered
(2 × 2·5 ml, s.c.) to replace fluid losses. Following surgery,
the animals were returned to their cages with free access to food
and water, with cages placed half over a heat mat to allow animals
to self-thermoregulate during recovery.
ICP measurement
ICP was measured using a SAMBA microcatheter (SAMBA
Sensors, Gothenburg, Sweden), as previously described (22). In
brief, the catheter was sealed in an epidural position inside a
fluid-filled hollow screw inserted in the parietal bone. Correct
positioning was confirmed by observation of pulse and respiratory
wave amplitudes and ICP response to abdominal compression.
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated using the
formula CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure – Mean ICP. At 24 h post-
MCAo, animals were re-anesthetized for one hour of ICP recording
prior to sacrifice. The left femoral artery was cannulated,
physiological monitoring equipment was reattached, and the ICP
catheter was reinserted and sealed.
Experimental stroke and hypothermia
Thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was performed
using a silicone-tipped monofilament passed via the external
carotid artery, according to our established method (21,23), with
a minor variation to shorten the length of the silicone tip of the
occluding thread to 3–4 mm.
After one hour of MCAo, Wistars were randomized by
sealed numbered envelope to hypothermia or normothermia.
Hypothermia-treated animals were cooled to 32·5°C using 70%
ethanol evaporation with a sprayer and a fan. Hypothermia was
maintained for 2·5 h, followed by controlled rewarming to 37°C
over 2·5 h. Normothermic animals were maintained at 37°C
under anesthesia for the same time intervals.
Neurological testing
Prior to 24 h post-stroke monitoring, animals were tested for
stroke-induced neurological deficits. The forelimb flexion, torso
twist, and lateral push tests were used to assess this and a total
neurological deficit score given out of six (higher score indicating
greater deficit) (24,25).
Histological analysis
At 25 h, brains were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining
and histological analysis of infarct and edema volumes using standard
methodology (21). Images were scanned at high resolution
using a digital slide scanner (Aperio,Vista, CA, USA) and analyzed
by an investigator blind to treatment.Infarct (corrected for edema)
was calculated by subtracting the measured interhemispheric
volume difference (edema volume, ipsilateral–contralateral) from
the measured infarct volume for each slice. Edema was calculated
by infarct volume minus the corrected infarct volume.
Exclusions and statistical analysis
Sample size calculations were performed using spss v21·0 (IBM,
Armonk, New York, USA) prior to the commencement of the
Long-Evans study (for a 15 mmHg difference in ICP) and the
Wistar study (for a 30% difference in infarct volume) based on
pilot data. Animals were excluded prior to randomization if there
were major deviations from the protocol, such as significant intraoperative
oxygen desaturation, blood loss, or temperature fluctuations.
Additionally, evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) upon brain removal after perfusion fixation was a pre-

specified exclusion criterion, because this may alter both stroke
outcome and ICP. Animals that died before final ICP measurement
were by necessity excluded from outcome analyses but are
fully reported. All physiological and histological data were analyzed
by an investigator blinded to treatment allocation.
Analysis of covariance was performed using stata/ic 11·1 for
Windows (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) to test whether
treatment had a significant overall effect on the primary outcome
of change in ICP at 24 h, and on the secondary outcome of CPP,
adjusting for baseline values. Other statistical tests were performed
using GraphPad PrismTM version 4·02 for Windows
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Student’s t-tests were
used to compare differences in infarct volumes and edema
volumes between groups. Significant differences were accepted at
the P < 0·05 level. Student’s t-tests were also performed on physiological
parameters for illustrative purposes to highlight changes
from baseline and between treatment groups; P values are
reported with no correction for multiple comparisons. Unless
otherwise stated, data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
Results
A total of 5 Long-Evans, 10 each of hypothermia-treated and
normothermic control, and 2 normothermic sham surgical
Wistar rats were included. A total of 16 animals were excluded:
eight pre-randomization, six due to SAH detected at postmortem
(one Long-Evans), and two post-randomization due to malfunction
of homeothermic heat mat (one hypothermia and one normothermia
Wistar). Of the six SAH animals, three normothermic
animals died, and SAH was detected at postmortem (including
the excluded Long-Evans rat). Three hypothermic-treated
animals survived at 24 h; however, SAH was detected at postmortem.
In these animals, there was no significant difference in ICP
at 24 h compared with baseline values (8·3 ± 2·9 mmHg vs.
10·5 ± 4·7 mmHg, respectively).
Infarct volume and ICP 24 h post-stroke
In Long-Evans rats (n = 5), mean edema-corrected infarct volume
was 84·3 ± 15·9 mm3 (range 61–105 mm3). ICP increased from
10·9 ± 4·6 mmHg at pre-MCAo baseline to 32·4 ± 11·4 mmHg at
24 h (Fig. 1). In normothermic Wistar rats, edema-corrected
infarct volume was 31·3 ± 18·4 mm3(Fig. 2a). ICP increased from
6·7 ± 2·3 mmHg at baseline to 31·6 ± 9·3 mmHg at 24 h (Fig. 3b).
Short-duration hypothermia to 32·5°C prevents
delayed ICP rise
Accurate temperature regulation was maintained in
hypothermia-treated animals and controls (Fig. 3a). Heart rate
and respiratory rate were lower during hypothermia (Table 1).
ICP traces revealed consistent pulse and respiratory waveforms.
There were no major changes in ICP during the initial six hour
monitoring, including during hypothermia. One animal had an
8·0 mmHg ICP rise during rewarming, to 15·5 mmHg at 6 h. At
24 h, its ICP was 4·6 mmHg. There were dramatic increases in
ICP at 24 h in all normothermic animals. ICP increased from
6·7 ± 2·3 mmHg at baseline to 31·6 ± 9·3 mmHg at 24 h, whereas
the ICP in hypothermia-treated animals was 5·4 ± 2·1 mmHg at
baseline and 7·0 ± 2·8 mmHg at 24 h. There was a significant
main effect of treatment group, F(2,17) = 31·87, P < 0·0001
(Fig. 3b). There was no overlap in final ICP values between the
two groups. This was despite equivalent core temperatures in the
two groups at 24 h and for the preceding 18 h (Fig. 3a). Sham
surgical animals showed no elevation of ICP.
There was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure
between groups (Table 1). Therefore, as predicted, there was a
significant main effect of treatment group on CPP at 24 h,
F(2,16) = 14·73, P = 0·0002 (Fig. 3c). There was significantly

smaller mean edema-corrected infarct volume in hypothermiatreated
animals compared to normothermics (15·4 ± 11·8 mm3
vs. 31·3 ± 18·4 mm3, P = 0·03). However, among the normothermia
animals, there was no clear association between infarct
volume and ICP. Edema volumes calculated from histological
sections showed a non-significant trend to be lower in the
hypothermia-treated animals (2·8 ± 4·6 mm3 vs. 17·1 ± 24·2 mm3
in normothermic animals, P = 0·08). Neurological deficit
scores also showed a non-significant trend to be lower in the
hypothermia-treated animals (2·5 ± 1·6 vs. 2·2 ± 1·2 in normothermic
animals,P > 0·05) (Fig. 2b); however, there was no association
between neurological deficit scores and ICP (Fig. 4).
Discussion
ICP is known to rise after large stroke, and hypothermia is well
known to lower ICP (6). However, this study has revealed several
important novel results. First, quite dramatic elevations in ICP
were seen following only small stroke in normothermic animals.
Second, a short period of hypothermia early post-stroke had a
prolonged effect moderating subsequent ICP long after rewarming.
Hypothermia treatment completely abolished the dramatic
rise in ICP seen at 24 h in the normothermic animals, although
no differences were seen between groups during the hypothermic
interval.
The dramatic ICP elevations in normothermic animals were
seen despite their small stroke sizes. Infarct and edema volumes
resulting from temporary MCAo were approximately 1/6 of the
maximal volume that can result from permanent occlusion in our
hands, yet ICP elevation in the normothermic animals was dramatic.
As already alluded to, we have been unable to find data
reporting ICP measurement 24 h after small strokes, in either
experimental animals or humans. Others have shown ICP elevation
after moderate–large stroke in rat stroke models, peaking at
24–72 h (5,26). Baseline and post-stroke ICP values were similar
to our results in the study that also monitored over the ipsilateral
cortex (26) but lower in the study using infratentorial monitoring
(5). ICP gradients between different cerebral compartments have
been reported (27), so this may explain the apparent differences in
measured pressures. Silasiet al. (26) reported ICP only in animals
with massive infarction (228 ± 36 mm3). Kotwicaet al. (5) studied
a mixture of infarct volumes, although even the group with the
smallest strokes in their study had reported hemispheric lesion
volumes larger than those calculated from our data. Interestingly,
Kotwica et al. (5) reported similar ICPs at 24 h in the smaller and
larger stroke groups, although some of the animals with larger
strokes had a second, higher ICP peak at three to four days. The
findings of the current study raise the question of whether the
small volume of edema seen could be responsible for such dramatic
ICP elevation in the normothermic animals.
Edema may have effects by increasing ICP post-stroke but may
also have important effects through local swelling and mass effect,
which may be associated with brain herniation and death after
stroke (4). Schwab et al. (4) studied 48 patients with large hemispheric
stroke and reported that although significantly elevated,
ICP (>35 mmHg) reliably predicted death; clinical signs of brain
herniation preceded ICP elevation in all 39 nonsurviving patients
in their study. This suggests that in patients with large strokes,
dramatic ICP elevation may be secondary to brain herniation
(because of mass effect), not its primary cause. One may then ask,
if ICP elevation does not cause brain herniation, is it important?

We believe so, primarily because of potential effects on CPP: the
difference between arterial pressure and ICP. Perfusion of periinfarct
regions supplied by collateral vessels is already compromised
and normal autoregulation impaired, such that perfusion
of the penumbra is CPP dependent. Because of its effect on CPP,
ICP elevation post-stroke could well be the mechanism for secondary
‘collateral failure’ and stroke-in-progression. Clearly, this
possibility requires further investigation.
Our second key finding was that a brief period of hypothermia
exerts a prolonged effect on ICP. This is not an intuitive concept
and has not previously been investigated. Studies in other brain
injury models have shown minimal effect of hypothermia on ICP
in the early phase post-injury (28), as also seen in our study.
However, ICP was not measured at later times after rewarming.
The effect of short-duration hypothermia that we observed
appears to be a ‘switch-like’ mechanism, which completely
prevented ICP elevation at 24 h. The exact mechanism has not
yet been elucidated; however, it has obvious potential clinical
importance.
The results raise the intriguing possibility that for the use of
hypothermia after stroke, ‘less may be more’. Therapeutic hypothermia
in patients has traditionally been administered for
12–72 h and carries significant logistical and technical challenges.
Rebound ICP elevation can be a significant problem, and prolonged
rewarming protocols have been instituted in many studies
to try to avoid this. Prolonged hypothermia is associated with a
degree of immunosuppression. This and the sedative effects of
shivering suppressant medication may be a particular problem in
stroke patients because of their increased risk of pneumonia. A
recent early phase trial reported very high rates of pneumonia in
hypothermia-treated patients cooled for 24 h plus 12 h rewarming
(11). Shorter duration cooling may reduce such complications
, and most of the supportive experimental studies have
shown neuroprotection with short-duration cooling (29). There
is a wealth of data showing that infarct size and functional
outcome are significantly improved by short-duration hypothermia
at both early (24 h) and later (three days post-stroke) (30).

hypothermia studies, of 145 experiments, the median cooling
duration was 180 min. Interestingly, in that study, a post hoc
analysis indicated that shorter duration cooling may be associated
with better neuroprotection (17). Despite being the only paradigm
tried in human studies, prolonged hypothermia has only
been investigated in relatively few experimental focal ischemia
studies, and there are little easily interpretable data directly comparing
short vs. long duration hypothermia. Yamamotoet al. (31)
showed neuroprotection with either 3 h or 22 h cooling but only
when this was begun prior to stroke induction (31,32). Colbourne
et al. (32,33) have conducted several studies showing effectiveness
of long-duration cooling, and one showing long-duration cooling
was more effective than short; however, in that study, the shortduration
group were cooled for 12 h, significantly longer than in
the great bulk of experimental hypothermia research (33). In
contrast, Markarian et al. (34) found greater neuroprotection
with longer durations of hypothermia; however, the longest durations
tested were three to four hours. The findings of the current
study suggest that short-duration hypothermia, the dominant
paradigm used in successful experimental studies, should perhaps
be subject to trial in patients.
There were some unavoidable limitations to this study. There
were differences in intraoperative physiological variables (particularly
reduced heart and respiratory rates) during the cooling
phase. This is largely unavoidable in hypothermia because heart
and respiratory rates and anesthetic requirement drop considerably
during this therapy. However, there is no known way these
factors could account for the dramatic differences seen in final
ICP. The measurement of ICP beyond 24 h, although desirable,
was beyond the scope of this study and will be the focus of future
investigations.
In conclusion, short-duration, moderate hypothermia commenced
shortly after onset of experimental stroke had a profound
, sustained, neuroprotective effect, preventing subsequent
ICP elevation. This approach would be easier to apply in patients
than most currently used protocols and would potentially avoid
the problem of rewarming-induced ICP elevation. Further preclinical
testing is required before clinical proof of concept studies.
However, perhaps in the case of hypothermia following neurological
injury, less is more?
