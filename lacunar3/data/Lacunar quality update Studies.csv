The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that temporal changes in LV function and regional perfusion after cell therapy can be assessed in mice using echocardiographic imaging. METHODS: Wild-type mice (n = 25) were studied 7 and 28 days after permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Animals were randomized to receive closed-chest ultrasound-guided intramyocardial delivery of saline (n = 13) or 5 x 10(5) multipotential adult progenitor cells (MAPCs; n = 12) on day 7. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, LV ejection fraction, and stroke volume were measured using high-frequency echocardiography. Multiplanar assessments of perfusion and defect area size were made using myocardial contrast echocardiography. RESULTS: Between days 7 and 28, MAPC-treated animals had 40% to 50% reductions in defect size (P < .001) and 20% to 30% increases in total perfusion (P < .01). Perfusion did not change in nontreated controls. Both LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased between days 7 and 28 in both groups, but LV end-systolic volume increased to a lesser degree in MAPC-treated compared with control mice (+4.2 +/- 7.9 vs +19.2 +/- 22.0 muL, P < .05). LV ejection fraction increased in the MAPC-treated mice and decreased in control mice (+3.0 +/- 4.3% vs -5.6 +/- 5.9%, P < .01). There was a significant linear relation between the change in LV ejection fraction and the change in either defect area size or total perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency echocardiography and myocardial contrast echocardiography in murine models of ischemic LV dysfunction can be used to assess the response to stem cell therapy and to characterize the relationship among spatial flow, ventricular function, and ventricular remodeling.",2014,Journal Article,J Am Soc Echocardiogr,Y.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether RIPostC attenuates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by abating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. CHOP, a multifunctional transcription factor in ER stress, regulates the expression of genes related to apoptosis, such as Bim and Bcl-2. Male SD rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion, and RIPostC was induced by three cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion on bilateral femoral arteries immediately after ischemia. CHOP siRNA (CHOPi) and control siRNA (Coni) were injected into the right lateral ventricle 30 min before the beginning of ischemia. RIPostC, CHOPi, or RIPostC + CHOPi application reduced infarct volume, improved the neurological function, and decreased cell apoptosis. RIPostC increased the protein level of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and decreased the protein level of phosphorylated-EIF2alpha, caspase-12, and CHOP. Furthermore, the expression of CHOP, Bim and cleaved-caspase-3 was decreased, while Bcl-2 expression was increased in response to application of RIPostC, CHOPi, or RIPostC + CHOPi. In sum, RIPostC protects against ischemia-reperfusion brain injury in rats by attenuating ER stress response-induced apoptosis.",2014,Journal Article,Transl Stroke Res,X.

Pro-GLP-1 was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice once a day for 7days before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. The neurological deficit score and TTC staining were determined 24h after ischemia. The results demonstrated that Pro-GLP-1 was slowly degraded in the plasma and brain of the mice, and GLP-1 could be detected even 12h after administration. Pro-GLP-1 was significantly neuroprotective in C57BL/6 mice subjected to MCAO. In cultured cortical neurons, treatment with Pro-GLP-1 attenuated apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The neuroprotective effects of Pro-GLP-1 were blocked by a selective GLP-1 receptor antagonist and knockdown of GLP-1 receptor with shRNA. However, Pro-GLP-1 had no effect on blood glucose and insulin levels which indicated that neuroprotection was mediated by the activation of GLP-1 receptor in the brain. Pro-GLP-1 repaired the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and decreased the expression of caspase-3. The anti-apoptotic effect was mediated by the cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt pathway.

A promising approach to accelerate the development of new therapeutics is the use of high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Using a cell-based high-throughput oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model, we evaluated 1,200 small molecules for repurposed application in stroke therapy. Isoxsuprine hydrochloride was identified as a potent neuroprotective compound in primary neurons exposed to OGD. Isoxsuprine, a beta2-adrenergic agonist and NR2B subtype-selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, demonstrated no loss of efficacy when administered up to an hour after reoxygenation in an in vitro stroke model. In an animal model of transient focal ischemia, isoxsuprine significantly reduced infarct volume compared to vehicle (137 +/- 18 mm3 versus 279 +/- 25 mm3, p < 0.001). Isoxsuprine, a peripheral vasodilator, was FDA approved for the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease.

Here we report that stress impairs neurovascular coupling (NVC), the process that matches neuronal activity with increased local blood flow. A stressed phenotype was induced in male rats by administering a 7-d heterotypical stress paradigm. NVC was modeled by measuring parenchymal arteriole (PA) vasodilation in response to neuronal stimulation in amygdala brain slices. After stress, vasodilation of PAs to neuronal stimulation was greatly reduced, and dilation of isolated PAs to external K(+) was diminished, suggesting a defect in smooth muscle inwardly rectifying K(+) (KIR) channel function. Consistent with these observations, stress caused a reduction in PA KIR2.1 mRNA and smooth muscle KIR current density, and blocking KIR channels significantly inhibited NVC in control, but not in stressed, slices. Delivery of corticosterone for 7 d (without stressors) or RU486 (before stressors) mimicked and abrogated NVC impairment by stress, respectively. We conclude that stress causes a glucocorticoid-mediated decrease in functional KIR channels in amygdala PA myocytes. This renders arterioles less responsive to K(+) released from astrocytic endfeet during NVC, leading to impairment of this process. Because the fidelity of NVC is essential for neuronal health, the impairment characterized here may contribute to the pathophysiology of brain disorders with a stress component.",2014,Journal Article,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,T.

The progressive remodeling of brain microvessels due to arterial hypertension or other vascular risk factors causes subtle, but constant cognitive decline through to manifest dementia and substantially increases the risk for stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests the contribution of the immune system to disease initiation and progression, but a more detailed understanding is impaired by the unavailability of appropriate animal models. Here, we introduce the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model for early onset cSVD and unveiled substantial immune changes in conjunction with brain abnormalities that resemble clinical findings. RESULTS: In contrast to age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, male SHR exhibited non-spatial memory deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain atrophy and a reduction of white matter volumes in SHR. Histological analyses confirmed white matter demyelination and unveiled a circumscribed blood brain barrier dysfunction in conjunction with micro- and macrogliosis in deep cortical regions. Flow cytometry and histological analyses further revealed substantial disparities in cerebral CD45high leukocyte counts and distribution patterns between SHR and WKY. SHR showed lower counts of T cells in the choroid plexus and meningeal spaces as well as decreased interleukin-10 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the other hand, both T and NK cells were significantly augmented in the SHR brain microvasculature.

However, little's known about the underlying mechanism. Here, a cerebral artery occlusion (MACO)/reperfusion rat model and rat primary cortical neuron culture exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were established to evaluate the effect of baicalin on ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis. We found baicalin can significantly less neurological deficit and reduced infarct volume in vivo. And it efficiently inhibited neuronal apoptosis in vivo and vitro, which was especially characterized by the enhancing of transcription and expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Baicalin markedly increased myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) level either in ischemic hemisphere or in primary cortical neuron cultures, whiles the anti-apoptosis effect of baicalin was significantly inhibited by transfected with the small interfering RNA of MRTF-A (MRTF-A siRNA) in primary cortical neuron cultures. The luciferase assays also indicated baicalin enhanced the transactivity of MCL-1 and BCL-2 promoter by activating the key CArG box (CC [A/T] 6GG) element, which was reduced by MRTF-A siRNA, suggesting MRTF-A may participate the anti-apoptosis effect of baicalin, and MRTF-A was involved in the transcriptional activity of MCL-1 and BCL-2 that was induced by baicalin. LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) and PD98059 (extracellular signal regulates kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor) obviously reduced baicalin-induced MRTF-A expression and transactivity and expression of MCL-1 and BCL-2, which further abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of baicalin on neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, our data provided the evidence demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of baicalin partially due to MRTF-A-mediated transactivity and expression of MCL-1 and BCL-2 by triggering the CArG box, which might be controlled by the activation of PI3K and ERK1/2.",2015,Journal Article,Eur J Pharmacol,W.

Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific proteases 3 (SENP3), a member of the SUMO-specific protease family, was identified as an isopeptidase that deconjugates SUMOylation (The covalent modification by SUMO) of modified protein substrates. It is reported that SUMO-2/3 conjugation, a member of SUMOylation, presented neuroprotection. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of SENP3 and to explore its role potential role in SAH. A total of 95 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group and SAH groups at 6, 12, 24, 48 h, day 3, day 5, and day 7. SAH groups suffered experimental SAH by injection with 0.3 ml nonheparinized autoblood into the prechiasmatic cistern. SENP3 expression is surveyed by western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The levels of cleavage caspase-3 were determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry. SENP3 protein expression was significantly up-regulated after SAH which peaked at 24 h; however, the mRNA expression of SENP3 remained unchanged. Meanwhile, the level of cleaved caspase-3 was also increased after SAH. There is a highly positive correlation between cleavage caspase-3 and SENP3 in protein level.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: First, rat subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) models were produced by endovascular perforation and examined for tenascin-C (TNC) and osteopontin (OPN) induction (representatives of MCPs) in vasospastic cerebral arteries using immunostaining. Second, recombinant TNC (r-TNC), recombinant OPN (r-OPN), or both were injected into a cisterna magna in healthy rats, and the effects on the diameter of basilar arteries were determined using India ink angiography. RESULTS: In SAH rats, TNC immunoreactivity was markedly induced in the smooth muscle cell layers of spastic cerebral arteries on day 1 but not in control animals. The TNC immunoreactivity decreased on day 3 as vasospasm improved: OPN immunoreactivity, on the other hand, was more induced in the arterial wall on day 3. r-TNC injections caused prolonged contractions of rat basilar arteries, which were reversed by r-OPN, although r-OPN itself had no effect on the vessel diameter.

We investigated whether ubiquitin conjugase 9 (Ubc9), the E2 conjugase for SUMOylation, is associated with neuroprotection induced by isoflurane preconditioning (IsoPC). In vitro, Ubc9 protein expression was evaluated at 4 and 24 h after reoxygenation. The role of Ubc9 in the neuroprotective effect was assessed in the presence or absence of Ubc9 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo, rats were preconditionally exposed for 1 h to 2% isoflurane for five consecutive days followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurobehavioral scores and infarction volume were determined at different times after reperfusion. The role of Ubc9 in ischemic tolerance was evaluated by intracerebroventricular microinjection with the Ubc9 siRNA. We showed that isoflurane preconditioning improved the cell viability of the SH-SY5Y cells that were challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation. It also reduced brain infarct volumes and improved neurologic outcomes in the focal cerebral ischemic rat. The expression of Ubc9 was upregulated by isoflurane preconditioning. Knockdown of Ubc9 significantly attenuated the isoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotective effects. Isoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotection against ischemic injuries is mediated by Ubc9.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been associated with aneurysms, but potential mechanisms are unclear. Cultured rat cerebral SMCs overexpressing myocardin induced expression of key SMC contractile genes (SM-alpha-actin, SM-22alpha, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), while dominant-negative cells suppressed expression. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment inhibited this contractile phenotype and induced pro-inflammatory/matrix-remodeling genes (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-9, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-1 beta). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased expression of KLF4, a known regulator of SMC differentiation. Kruppel-like transcription factor 4 (KLF4) small interfering RNA abrogated TNF-alpha activation of inflammatory genes and suppression of contractile genes. These mechanisms were confirmed in vivo after exposure of rat carotid arteries to TNF-alpha and early on in a model of cerebral aneurysm formation. Treatment with the synthesized TNF-alpha inhibitor 3,6-dithiothalidomide reversed pathologic vessel wall alterations after induced hypertension and hemodynamic stress. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that TNF-alpha promotes epigenetic changes through KLF4-dependent alterations in promoter regions of myocardin, SMCs, and inflammatory genes. In conclusion, TNF-alpha induces phenotypic modulation of cerebral SMCs through myocardin and KLF4-regulated pathways. These results demonstrate a novel role for TNF-alpha in promoting a pro-inflammatory/matrix-remodeling phenotype, which has important implications for the mechanisms behind intracranial aneurysm formation.",2013,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,M.

However, replacement of lost oligodendrocytes may not be the only mechanism for white-matter recovery. Emerging data now suggest that coordinated signaling between neural, glial, and vascular cells in the entire neurovascular unit may be required.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors exert neuroprotection in both cellular and animal models of ischaemic stroke. However, which HDAC isoform (or isoforms) mediates this beneficial effect has not yet been determined. 2. In the present study, gene levels of the HDAC isoforms were determined in the mouse cortex using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), whereas changes in the expression of individual zinc-dependent HDAC family members were evaluated by western blotting, 3, 12, 24 and 48 h after cerebral ischaemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male Kunming mice. 3. The HDAC isoforms HDAC1-11 were all expressed in the mouse cortex and differentially affected by cerebral ischaemia. Notably, there was a substantial increase in HDAC3, HDAC6 and HDAC11 expression during the early phases of experimental stroke, indicating their contribution to stroke pathogenesis. Furthermore, induction of HDAC3 and HDAC6 in cortical neurons by ischaemic stroke was confirmed in vivo and in vitro using double-labelled immunostaining and RT-PCR, respectively. Therefore, small hairpin (sh) RNAs were used to selectively knock down HDAC3 or HDAC6. This knockdown appreciably promoted the survival of cortical neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation. 4.

Despite its frequent induction in pathologic states, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that regulate p75(NTR) expression after injury. Here, we show that after focal cerebral ischemia in vivo or oxygen-glucose deprivation in organotypic hippocampal slices or neurons, p75(NTR) is rapidly induced. A concomitant induction of proNGF, a ligand for p75(NTR), is also observed. Induction of this ligand/receptor system is pathologically relevant, as a decrease in apoptosis, after oxygen-glucose deprivation, is observed in hippocampal neurons or slices after delivery of function-blocking antibodies to p75(NTR) or proNGF and in p75(NTR) and ngf haploinsufficient slices. Furthermore, a significant decrease in infarct volume was noted in p75(NTR)-/- mice compared with the wild type. We also investigated the regulatory mechanisms that lead to post-ischemic induction of p75(NTR). We demonstrate that induction of p75(NTR) after ischemic injury is independent of transcription but requires active translation. Basal levels of p75(NTR) in neurons are maintained in part by the expression of microRNA miR-592, and an inverse correlation is seen between miR-592 and p75(NTR) levels in the adult brain. After cerebral ischemia, miR-592 levels fall, with a corresponding increase in p75(NTR) levels. Importantly, overexpression of miR-592 in neurons decreases the level of ischemic injury-induced p75(NTR) and attenuates activation of pro-apoptotic signaling and cell death.

Multiple pathways of oxidant stress, inflammation, and excitotoxicity lead to cell damage and death, including caspase-dependent apoptosis. Caspase-2 (Casp2; Nedd-2, Ich-1) is a developmentally regulated initiator caspase, which poorly cleaves other caspases but can initiate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. We have investigated if Casp2 could mediate perinatal ischemic brain damage. METHODS: Casp2 expression in human neonatal brains and developmental patterns in rats and mice were evaluated. Casp2-deficient (Casp2(-/-)), wild-type (WT), and heterozygous (Casp2(+/-)) newborn C57BL/6 mice were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (unilateral carotid occlusion + exposure to 10% oxygen for 50 minutes) or intracerebral injection of the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor agonist ibotenate. In addition, Casp2 specific siRNAs were preinjected into the brain of WT newborn mice 24 hours before ibotenate treatment. Brain tissues were examined by immunohistochemical staining (cresyl violet, MAP2, NF68, Casp2, Casp3) and Western blotting. Lesion volumes and injury in the cortical plates and white matter were quantified together with activated Casp3. RESULTS: Casp2 is highly expressed in the neonatal brain. Casp2-deficient mice subjected to hypoxia-ischemia at postnatal day 9 present significantly lower cerebral infarction, reduced white matter injury, and reduced Casp3 activation in the thalamus and hippocampus. Both Casp2(-/-) mice and siRNA-administered WT mice conferred reduction of gray and white matter injury after excitotoxic insult at postnatal day 5.

Genetically engineered mice deficient in Lck, gene silencing using siRNA, and pharmacological approaches were used.

Lck gene silencing using siRNA abolished tolerance against both stimuli. Lck-/- mice or neurons isolated from Lck-/- mice did not exhibit PC-induced tolerance. An Lck antagonist administered to wild-type mice significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effect of PC in the mouse focal ischemia model. Using pharmacological and gene silencing strategies, we also showed that PKCepsilon is an upstream regulator of Lck, and Fyn is a downstream target of Lck. We have discovered that Lck plays an essential role in PC in both cellular and animal models of stroke. Our data also show that the PKCepsilon-Lck-Fyn axis is a key mediator of PC.

MMPs belong to the zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases which are involved in the proteolytic degradation of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but also are capable of processing and releasing bioactive molecules such as growth factors, proteinase inhibitors, and cytokines. Locally increased levels of activated MMPs modulate and contribute to the progression of various diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, arthritis, and others. Therefore, activated MMPs are suitable biological targets for the specific and noninvasive visualization of aforementioned pathologies in vivo.

However, its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) by IL-6 in the reactive oxygen species defense system after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). METHODS: IL-6 was injected in mice before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed for analysis of an IL-6R association after tFCI. Primary mouse cerebral cortical neurons were transfected with small interfering RNA probes targeted to IL-6Ralpha or gp130 and were used for chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay, luciferase promoter assay, and cell viability assay. Reduction in infarct volumes by IL-6 was measured after tFCI. RESULTS: IL-6R was disrupted through a disassembly between IL-6Ralpha and gp130 associated by protein oxidation after reperfusion after tFCI. This suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and finally induced neuronal cell death through a decrease in manganese-superoxide dismutase. However, IL-6 injections prevented disruption of IL-6R against reperfusion after tFCI, consequently restoring activity of STAT3 through recovery of the binding of STAT3 to gp130. Moreover, IL-6 injections restored the transcriptional activity of the manganese-superoxide dismutase promoter through recovery of the recruitment of STAT3 to the manganese-superoxide dismutase promoter and reduced infarct volume after tFCI. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that IL-6 has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury through IL-6R-mediated STAT3 activation and manganese-superoxide dismutase expression.",2011,Journal Article,Stroke,J.

DESIGN: Multi-institutional, retrospective study. ANIMALS: 21 dogs. PROCEDURES: Medical records (including diagnostic testing results) and MRI images of the brain were reviewed for Greyhounds with ischemic stroke that had been evaluated at 4 institutions. The proportion of Greyhounds with ischemic stroke was compared with the proportion of non-Greyhound dogs with ischemic stroke. Demographic information for dogs evaluated at each institution was obtained to determine the proportion of Greyhounds in the hospital populations. RESULTS: 21 Greyhounds with ischemic stroke were identified. Abnormalities in coagulation were not identified in the 14 Greyhounds that underwent such testing. Systemic hypertension was identified in 6 of 14 Greyhounds that underwent such testing. No other abnormalities were identified by means of other routine diagnostic tests for Greyhounds. For all institutions combined, the prevalence of ischemic stroke in Greyhounds was 0.66% (21/3,161 Greyhounds). Greyhounds were significantly more likely to be evaluated because of ischemic stroke, compared with all other dog breeds combined (OR, 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 10.2). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of this study suggested that Greyhounds were predisposed to ischemic stroke, compared with all other breeds combined. Coagulation abnormalities did not seem to contribute to ischemic stroke. Hypertension may have contributed to the development of ischemic stroke.

Although epidemiological studies of CADASIL in Japan have been limited, more than 100 cases of this condition have been diagnosed in Japan. In our laboratory, we diagnosed 37 CADASIL cases genetically and identified three features common to Japanese cases. One is the wide distribution of onset age for clinical symptoms other than migraine, with the onset of symptoms being later than age 60 in 22% of cases. Second, the majority (65%) of Japanese CADASIL cases have stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking. Third, in 22% cases there was no definite family history of stroke. However, the previous diagnostic criteria proposed by Dabous excluded several definite cases in our cohort. Therefore, to avoid missing undiagnosed cases of CADASIL, we have generated new diagnostic criteria for Japanese CADASIL based on the knowledge accumulated during the past 10 years, and compared sensitivity of two criteria. In our diagnosed Japanese CADASIL cases, the sensitivity of the new criteria was 19% and 78% for probable and possible cases, respectively, and only one case was (Fig. 3) missed when using the new criteria.

The well-known impact of MMPs on extracellular matrix destruction triggered by inflammation as a foundation for several diseases, including stroke, is very much in evidence. Newly, some additional aspects of MMP function considering their intracellular activity crucial for neuronal death following ischemic brain damage have emerged. The effect of blood-brain barrier disruption caused by MMPs on the prognosis in patients suffering from spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been of interest since it throws a new light upon the pathogenesis, course and possible therapeutic approaches for this least treatable and at the same time most life-threatening form of stroke. Hence, we primarily aimed to review the current clinical knowledge on the significance of metalloproteinase activation in the course of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in humans. We also provide a brief characterization of the MMP enzyme family and report on the latest findings on issues arising from experimental studies. METHODS: A Medline search using the following key words was performed: matrix metalloproteinases + spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage/intracranial hemorrhage/bleeding/hemorrhagic stroke. We accepted studies reporting on MMP expression in adult patients with spontaneous ICH, as well as its relation to radiological and clinical features and patients' outcome. For the final review, 18 clinical studies were considered. MMP inhibition was reviewed on the basis of 11 relevant experimental studies. Also, some relevant reports on the biology of MMPs and their pathophysiology in ICH were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Many studies provide convincing evidence of a detrimental role of MMPs in ICH, stressing their association with neuroinflammation. The role of MMPs in hemorrhagic stroke appears critical for hematoma and brain edema growth as well as for neuronal death, which are understood as secondary brain injury and may have a considerable clinical impact. Although data on human spontaneous ICH are scarce and mostly based on small populations, they reveal the apparent correlation between MMPs and clinical and radiological ICH features as well as the functional outcome, which might rationalize future therapeutic strategies. However, attempts at MMP inhibition in spontaneous ICH have solely been made under experimental conditions and were associated with a wide range of possible side effects. Therefore, further comprehensive, elucidating investigations in this field are vital before any conclusions could be translated to humans.",2012,Journal Article,Cerebrovasc Dis,M.

We previously showed that mice deficient in the beta2AR (beta2KO) had smaller infarcts compared with WT (wild-type) mice (FVB) after MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion), a model of stroke. To elucidate mechanisms of this neuroprotection, we evaluated changes in gene expression using microarrays comparing differences before and after MCAO, and differences between genotypes. Genes associated with inflammation and cell deaths were enriched after MCAO in both genotypes, and we identified several genes not previously shown to increase following ischaemia (Ccl9, Gem and Prg4). In addition to networks that were similar between genotypes, one network with a central core of GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) and including biological functions such as carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and inflammation was identified in FVB mice but not in beta2KO mice. Analysis of differences between genotypes revealed 11 genes differentially expressed by genotype both before and after ischaemia. We demonstrate greater Glo1 protein levels and lower Pmaip/Noxa mRNA levels in beta2KO mice in both sham and MCAO conditions. As both genes are implicated in NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) signalling, we measured p65 activity and TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) levels 24 h after MCAO. MCAO-induced p65 activation and post-ischaemic TNFalpha production were both greater in FVB compared with beta2KO mice. These results suggest that loss of beta2AR signalling results in a neuroprotective phenotype in part due to decreased NF-kappaB signalling, decreased inflammation and decreased apoptotic signalling in the brain.",2012,Journal Article,ASN Neuro,R.

This study aimed to investigate how P2X7R functions in ICH-induced inflammatory injury and how the receptor interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome. METHODS: Rats were treated with P2X7R small interfering RNA (siRNA) 24 h before undergoing collagenase-induced ICH. A selective P2X7R inhibitor (blue brilliant G, BBG) or a peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) decomposition catalyst (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron(III) [FeTPPS]) was injected 30 min after ICH. Brain water content, hemorrhagic lesion volume, and neurological deficits were evaluated, and western blot, immunofluorescence, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were carried out. RESULTS: Striatal P2X7R and NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated after ICH. Gene silencing of P2X7R suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1beta/IL-18 release and significantly ameliorated brain edema and neurological deficits. Additionally, enhanced NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2, gp91(phox)) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as their cytotoxic product (ONOO(-)) were markedly attenuated by BBG treatment following ICH. This was accompanied by downregulations of the inflammasome components, IL-1beta/IL-18 and myeloperoxidase (MPO, a neutrophil marker). Most importantly, inflammasome activation and IL-1beta/IL-18 release were significantly inhibited by ONOO(-) decomposition with FeTPPS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate that P2X7R exacerbated inflammatory progression and brain damage in ICH rats possibly via NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1beta/IL-18 release and neutrophil infiltration. ONOO(-), a potential downstream signaling molecule of P2X7R, may play a critical role in triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",2015,Journal Article,J Neuroinflammation,L.

Development of neuroprotective therapies is contingent upon understanding the permeability of intravenously delivered medications through the blood brain barrier (BBB). In a model of pediatric CA we sought to characterize BBB permeability to small and large molecular weight substances. Additionally, we measured the percent brain water after CA. Asphyxia of 9 min was induced in 16-18 day-old rats. The rats were resuscitated and the BBB permeability to small (sodium fluorescein and gadoteridol) and large (immunoglobulin G, IgG) molecules was assessed at 1, 4, and 24 h after asphyxial CA or sham surgery. Percent brain water was measured post-CA and in shams using wet-to-dry brain weight. Fluorescence, gadoteridol uptake, or IgG staining at 1, 4h and over the entire 24 h post-CA did not differ from shams, suggesting absence of BBB permeability to these solutes. Cerebral water content was increased at 3h post-CA vs. sham. In conclusion, after 9 min of asphyxial CA there is no BBB permeability over 24h to conventional small or large molecule tracers despite the fact that cerebral water content is increased early post-CA indicating the development of brain edema.

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) administration could mediate oligodendrogenesis and remyelination after white matter injury in subcortical stroke. METHODS: Ischemia was induced in rats by injection of endothelin-1. At 24 hours, 0.4 mug/kg of BDNF or saline was intravenously administered to the treatment and control groups, respectively. Functional evaluation, MRI, and fiber tract integrity on tractography images were analyzed.

However, little is known about the effects of post-treatment with CART during the neuronal recovery after OGD and reoxygenation in cultured primary cortical neurons. The present study was to investigate the role of CART treated after OGD injury in neurons. Primary mouse cortical neurons were subjected to OGD and then treated with CART. Our data show that post-treatment with CART reduced the neuronal apoptosis caused by OGD injury. In addition, CART repaired OGD-impaired cortical neurons by increasing the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which promotes neurite outgrowth. This effect depends on pleiotrophin (PTN) as siRNA-mediated PTN knockdown totally abolished the increase in CART-stimulated GAP43 protein levels.

Numerous algorithms are available for evaluating this critical value, but a major limitation of current algorithms is that brain swelling is not appropriately considered. The model by Lin et al. is widely used, but overestimates swelling within the infarction, yielding infarct volumes which do not reflect the true infarct size. Herein, a new infarct volume algorithm is developed to minimize the effects of both peri-infarct and infarct core swelling on infarct volume measurement. 2,3,5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride-stained brain tissue of adult rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion was used for infarct volume analysis. When both peri-infarct swelling and infarction core swelling are removed from infarct volume calculations, such as accomplished by our algorithm, larger infarct volumes are estimated than those of Lin et al.'s algorithm. Furthermore, the infarct volume difference between the two algorithms is the greatest for small infarcts (<10% of brain volume) when peri-infarct swelling is the greatest. Finally, using data from four published studies, our algorithm is compared to Lin et al.'s algorithm. Our algorithm offers a more reliable estimation of the infarct volume after ischemic brain injury, and thus may provide the foundation for comparing infarct volumes between experimental studies and standardizing infarct volume quantification to aid in the selection of the best candidates for clinical trials.",2015,Journal Article,Transl Stroke Res,D.

CADASIL is caused by a cysteine residue-related mutation in the EGF-like repeat on the extracellular domain of Notch3. Pathological examination of a CADASIL brain indicated abnormal accumulation of the extracellular domain of Notch3 with extracellular matrix proteins, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 and vitronectin, around vascular smooth muscle cells. CARASIL is caused by a mutation in HTAR1, a serine protease that regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. The mutation in HTAR1 related to CARASIL fails to repress TGF-beta signaling and induces the accumulation of extracellular matrix, including the extra domain-A region of fibronectin and versican. The individual and common pathomechanisms of hereditary cerebral small vessel disease are discussed in this review.",2015,Journal Article,Brain Nerve,T.

We have previously reported that activation of Etk leads to apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of Etk in neuronal injury induced by H(2)O(2) or ischemia. Using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we found that treatment with H(2)O(2) significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Etk and its downstream signaling molecule Stat1 in primary cortical neurons. Inhibiting Etk activity by LFM-A13 or knocking down Etk expression by a specific shRNA increased the survival of primary cortical neurons. Similarly, at 1 day after a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in adult rats, both phosphorylated Etk and Stat1 were coexpressed with apoptotic markers in neurons in the penumbra. Pretreatment with LFM-A13 or an adenoviral vector encoding the kinase deletion mutant Etkk attenuated caspase-3 activity and infarct volume in ischemic brain.

The potential to treat arterial thrombosis with plasmin was recognized, but it was not until 1958 that its first use in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) was described. However, since computer tomography (CT) was not available until the mid 1970s, optimal selection of patients was not possible. Early studies with streptokinase in AIS showed an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage and lack of efficacy, which was associated with low fibrin specificity. The search for new agents with a better risk-benefit profile continued until 1979 when tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was discovered. In 1983 it became possible to produce recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) by expression of a cloned gene which enabled clinical trials to be started, mainly for coronary thrombolysis. In 1995, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study showed that rt-PA was an effective treatment for AIS, nowadays for use up to 4.5 h after onset. However, rt-PA still often fails in achieving rapid reperfusion, has relatively low recanalization rates and is associated with an increased bleeding risk. Several attempts have been made to develop thrombolytics with a better risk-benefit profile than rt-PA, but no real impact on clinical practice was observed. In 1994, it was shown that tenecteplase (rt-PA-TNK) had a higher fibrin specificity than rt-PA, but its clinical use in AIS was described only in 2005. The recently reported results of a small phase 2B trial showed significantly better reperfusion and clinical outcome with rt-PA-TNK compared to rt-PA; patients were selected by CT perfusion and angiography, and treated within 6 h after stroke onset. Currently, a phase 3 trial of rt-PA-TNK versus rt-PA is being planned in patients at an onset up to 4.5 h. The most fibrin-specific recombinant plasminogen activator desmoteplase originates from 1991, and its clinical development in AIS started in 2005. Desmoteplase is in phase 3 development for the treatment of AIS between 3 and 9 h after onset in AIS patients presenting with occlusion or high-grade stenosis.",2013,Journal Article,Cerebrovasc Dis,J.

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies focusing on neuroprotection are under review, among which, inhibition of the proteasome is attractive, as it affects multiple cellular pathways. As proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib have severe side effects, we applied the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118, which is putatively better tolerated, and analysed its therapeutic potential in a mouse model of cerebral ischaemia. Stroke was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion model. BSc2118 was intrastriatally injected 12 h post-stroke in mice that had received normal saline or recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator injections during early reperfusion. Brain injury, behavioural tests, western blotting, MMP9 zymography and analysis of angioneurogenesis were performed for up to 3 months post-stroke. Single injections of BSc2118 induced long-term neuroprotection, reduced functional impairment, stabilized blood-brain barrier through decreased MMP9 activity and enhanced angioneurogenesis when given no later than 12 h post-stroke. On the contrary, recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator enhanced brain injury, which was reversed by BSc2118. Protein expression of the transcription factor HIF1A was significantly increased in saline-treated and recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-treated mice after BSc2118 application. In contrast, knock-down of HIF1A using small interfering RNA constructs or application of the HIF1A inhibitor YC1 (now known as RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 1 (RBMS1)) reversed BSc2118-induced neuroprotection. Noteworthy, loss of neuroprotection after combined treatment with BSc2118 and YC1 in recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-treated animals was in the same order as in saline-treated mice, i.e. reduction of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator toxicity through BSc2118 did not solely depend on HIF1A. Thus, the proteasome inhibitor BSc2118 is a promising new candidate for stroke therapy, which may in addition alleviate recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator-induced brain toxicity.",2012,Journal Article,Brain,T.

Based on the lead, a series of tricyclic diterpene derivatives was designed and synthesized, and their neuroprotective effects were further evaluated against glutamate-, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)- and nutrient deprivation-induced neuronal injury using cell-based assays. To our delight, most of these synthetic compounds exhibited increased neuroprotective effects and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability without cellular toxicity. The most potent compound, compound 30, showed significantly improved neuroprotection against neuronal injury in primary neurons. Furthermore, compound 30 exhibited remarkable neuroprotection in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rats by reducing their infarct sizes and neurological deficit scores. A mechanistic exploration using in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the neuroprotection of these compounds was at least partly mediated by improving the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein.

Spontaneously hypertensive/stroke prone rats (SHR/SP) with unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) and a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) have white-matter (WM) damage similar to that seen in VCI. We hypothesized that WM injury was due to hypoxia-mediated, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Twelve-week-old SHR/SP had UCAO/JPD and were studied with immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Morris water maze (MWM) testing. One week after UCAO/JPD, WM showed a significant increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which increased further by 3 weeks.

Infiltrating T cells and neutrophils appeared around endothelial cells from 1 to 3 weeks after UCAO/JPD, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) colocalized with inflammatory cells. At 3 weeks, WM immunostained for IgG, indicating BBB leakage. Minocycline (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was given every other day from weeks 12 to 20.

Here, we aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect in stroke and studied p66(Shc) gene regulation in human ischaemic stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ischaemia/reperfusion brain injury was induced by performing a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery on wild-type mice. After the ischaemic episode and upon reperfusion, small interfering RNA targeting p66(Shc) was injected intravenously. We observed that post-ischaemic p66(Shc) knockdown preserved blood-brain barrier integrity that resulted in improved stroke outcome, as identified by smaller lesion volumes, decreased neurological deficits, and increased survival. Experiments on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells demonstrated that silencing of the adaptor protein p66(Shc) preserves claudin-5 protein levels during hypoxia/reoxygenation by reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species production. Further, we found that in peripheral blood monocytes of acute ischaemic stroke patients p66(Shc) gene expression is transiently increased and that this increase correlates with short-term neurological outcome. CONCLUSION: Post-ischaemic silencing of p66(Shc) upon reperfusion improves stroke outcome in mice while the expression of p66(Shc) gene correlates with short-term outcome in patients with ischaemic stroke.",2015,Journal Article,Eur Heart J,R.

We compared effects of intravenous tPA alone (10 mg/kg) versus a combination of low-dose tPA (5 mg/kg) plus 10 mg/kg rA2. Totally 152 rats were used. Our results showed that: (1) at 24 h after stroke, the combination slightly reduced brain infarction compared to saline (9.2% reduction), and tPA (7.4% reduction), although the reductions did not reach statistical significance; while the combination significantly reduced (22.2% reduction) the conventional tPA-elevated intracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) transformation; (2) at 7 days after stroke, the combination significantly attenuated conventional tPA alone-elevated iron deposition at peri-lesion area (68.2% reduction); (3) at 28 days after stroke, the combination significantly improved performance of adhesive tape-removal test, which was accompanied by a significantly higher micro vessel density at peri- infarct areas compared to conventional tPA alone group.In conclusion, compared to conventional tPA alone, when treated at delayed 4-hour after stroke, the combination of low-dose tPA plus rA2 therapy provides a safer profile by lowering risk of ICH transformation and improves neurological function recovery after stroke.",2015,Journal Article,Neurosci Lett,Y.

Moreover, the striatum, both dorsal and ventral, is a vital regulator of stress perception and associated physiological responses. This study investigates potential synergistic effects of focal stroke in the ventrolateral striatum and restraint stress on motor and spatial performance. Adult male Long-Evans rats were pre-trained in a skilled reaching task and randomly assigned to sham, stroke-only, stress-only and stroke+stress conditions. Ventrolateral striatal focal ischemia was induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) infusion. Rats in stress-only and stroke+stress groups received 21 days of mild restraint stress after stroke. All rats were tested in the skilled reaching task and the ziggurat task (ZT) for post-stroke motor and spatial performance. There was no effect of ventrolateral striatal ischemia or stress alone on motor and spatial performance. Notably, stroke and stress interacted synergistically to reduce reaching success and to disrupt qualitative aspects of movement performance in the absence of histological differences in lesion size. Thus, stress can precipitate behavioural deficits after focal ischemia even in the absence of significant functional deficits on its own.

However, systemic alteration of oxidative stress-related gene expression in normal brains and in brains with a high-glucose status after ischemic-reperfusion has not been explored. Using a polymerase chain reaction array system, we demonstrate that thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is induced by both oxidative stress and glucose. We found that Txnip mRNA is induced by ischemic-reperfusion injury and that Txnip is located in the cytoplasm of neurons. Moreover, in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and subsequent reoxygenation without glucose and in vivo administration of 3-nitropropionic acid also promoted an increase in Txnip in a time-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress without glucose can induce Txnip expression in the brain. However, calcium channel blockers inhibit induction of Txnip after OGD and reoxygenation. Using the polymerase chain reaction array with ischemic and hyperglycemic-ischemic samples, we confirmed that enhanced expression of Txnip was observed in hyperglycemic-ischemic brains after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Finally, transfection of Txnip small interfering RNA into primary neurons reduced lactate dehydrogenase release after OGD and reoxygenation.

This study is to investigate a potential role of HIOC on ameliorating early brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One hundred and fifty-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation. TrkB small interfering RNA (siRNA) or scramble siRNA was injected intracerebroventricularly 24h before SAH. HIOC was administrated intracerebroventricularly 3h after SAH and compared with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). SAH grade and neurologic scores were evaluated for the outcome study. For the mechanism study, the expression of TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB), phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) was detected by Western blots, and neuronal injury was determined by double immunofluorescence staining of neuronal nuclei and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling. Knocking down of TrkB decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and aggravated neurologic deficits 24h after SAH. HIOC activated TrkB/ERK pathway, decreased neuronal cell death, and improved neurobehavioral outcome, and these effects were abolished by TrkB siRNA. HIOC was more potent than BDNF in reduction of apoptosis 24h post-SAH. Thus, we conclude that administration of HIOC activated TrkB/ERK signaling cascade and attenuated early brain injury after SAH.

These reagents were used in immunohistochemical experiments to detect epitopes in post-mortem CADASIL brains (n=8), control brains, and cells overexpressing NOTCH3. To determine the biochemical nature of NOTCH3 epitopes, we used these antibodies to probe pure NOTCH3-Fc fusion proteins treated with acid, urea, guanidinium, ionic detergents, acrylamide, and thiol- and phosphorus-based reductants. All antibodies avidly stained arteries in 8 of 8 CADASIL brain samples. The most prominent staining was in degenerating media of leptomeningeal arteries and sclerotic penetrating vessels. Normal appearing vessels from control brains were not reactive. Antibodies did not react with cultured cells overexpressing NOTCH3 or with purified NOTCH3-Fc protein. Furthermore, treatment of pure protein with acid, chaotropic denaturants, alkylators, and detergents failed to unmask N-terminal NOTCH3 epitopes.

Characterization of the SUMO-modified proteome is pivotal to define the mechanistic link between SUMO conjugation and such diseases. This is particularly evident for SUMO2/3 conjugation, which is massively activated after brain ischemia/stroke, and is believed to be a protective response. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of the SUMO3-modified proteome regulated by brain ischemia using a novel SUMO transgenic mouse. METHODS: To enable SUMO proteomics analysis in vivo, we generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing tagged SUMO1-3 paralogues. Transgenic mice were subjected to 10 minutes forebrain ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. SUMO3-conjugated proteins were enriched by anti-FLAG affinity purification and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Characterization of SUMO transgenic mice demonstrated that all 3 tagged SUMO paralogues were functionally active, and expression of exogenous SUMOs did not modify the endogenous SUMOylation machinery. Proteomics analysis identified 112 putative SUMO3 substrates of which 91 candidates were more abundant in the ischemia group than the sham group. Data analysis revealed processes/pathways with putative neuroprotective functions, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling, RNA processing, and SUMOylation-dependent ubiquitin conjugation. CONCLUSIONS: The identified proteins/pathways modulated by SUMOylation could be the key to understand the mechanisms linking SUMOylation to neuroprotection, and thus provide new promising targets for therapeutic interventions.

Stroke is responsible for 10% of deaths worldwide and is one of the leading causes of disability. MiRNAs are involved in stroke risk factors including hypertension, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes and dyslipidemia. The role of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of stroke has been the subject of more recent investigations. Animal studies, which dominate the field, have demonstrated the differential expression of miRNAs in brain and blood following ischemic or hemorrhagic insult and the potential use of miRNA antagonists to reduce focal cerebral damage. In particular, antagomirs to miR-145, -497, -181a, -1 and let-7f have been found to be neuroprotective in vivo.

The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathways have been considered molecular targets in pharmacologic intervention for ischemic diseases. Andrographolide, a labdane diterpene, has received increasing attention in recent years because of its various pharmacologic activities. We determined that andrographolide modulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling cascade in primary cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) to provide positive protection against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke in rats. In the present study, andrographolide (10 muM) increased HO-1 protein and messenger RNA expressions, Nrf2 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation in CECs, and these activities were disrupted by a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, but not by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD98059 or c-Jun amino-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125. Similar results were observed in confocal microscopy analysis. Moreover, andrographolide-induced Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions were significantly inhibited by Nrf2 small interfering RNA. Moreover, HO-1 knockdown attenuated the protective effect of andrographolide against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced CEC death. Andrographolide (0.1 mg/kg) significantly suppressed free radical formation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and brain infarction in MCAO-insulted rats, and these effects were reversed by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX. The mechanism is attributable to HO-1 activation, as directly evidenced by andrographolide-induced pronounced HO-1 expression in brain tissues, which was highly localized in the cerebral capillary. In conclusion, andrographolide increased Nrf2-HO-1 expression through p38 MAPK regulation, confirming that it provides protection against MCAO-induced brain injury. These findings provide strong evidence that andrographolide could be a therapeutic agent for treating ischemic stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.",2016,Journal Article,Transl Res,T. L.

The current knowledge of the matrisome of small brain vessels is reviewed with a focus on the basement membrane (BM), a specialized form of ECM located at the interface between endothelial cells, contractile cells (smooth muscle cells and pericytes), and astrocyte endfeet-a very strategic location in the communication pathway between the cerebral microcirculation and astrocytes.

Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected neural stem cells (NSCs) in newborn rats with cerebral palsy (CP). Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation (control group), PBS transplantation (PBS group), VEGF+NSCs transplantation (transgene NSCs group) and NSCs transplantation groups (NSCs group). PBS, Transgene NSCs and NSCs groups respectively received stereotactic injections of PBS, lentiviral vector (pGC-FU-VEGF) infected NSCs or a NSCs suspension in the left sensory-motor cortex 3 days after CP model was established. The NSCs activity, their impacts on neural cell growth and apoptosis, brain development and animal behaviors were examined on the animals up to age 35-days. As expected, unilateral carotid artery occlusion plus hypoxia (cerebral palsy model) resulted in severe neural developmental disorders, including slowed growth, increased in cortical neuron apoptosis, decreased cerebral cortex micro-vessel density and retarded behavior developments. Transplantation of NSCs not only resulted in increases in VEGF protein expression in rat brains, but also largely prevented the behavioral defects and brain tissue pathology that resulted from cerebral palsy procedure, with animals received VEGF transfected NSCs always being marginally better than these received un-transfected cells.

RNA-mediated gene silencing presents a new therapeutic approach for treating such diseases, but major challenge is to ensure minimal toxicity and target delivery of siRNA to injured BMECs. Injured BMECs overexpress tissue factor (TF), which the fusion protein EGFP-EGF1 could be targeted to. In this study, TNF alpha (TNF-alpha) was chosen as a stimulus for primary BMECs to produce injured endothelium in vitro. The EGFP-EGF1-PLGA nanoparticles (ENPs) with loaded TF-siRNA were used as a new carrier for targeted delivery to the injured BMECs. The nanoparticles then produced intracellular RNA interference against TF. We compared ENP-based transfections with NP-mediated transfections, and our studies show that the ENP-based transfections result in a more efficient downregulation of TF. Our findings also show that the TF siRNA-loaded ENPs had minimal toxicity, with almost 96% of the cells viable 24 h after transfection while Lipofectamine-based transfections resulted in only 75% of the cells. Therefore, ENP-based transfection could be used for efficient siRNA transfection to injured BMECs and for efficient RNA interference (RNAi).

The results showed that RIPC treatment significantly improved neurological deficits and decreased infarct volume.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether EP(+) improves outcomes of ischaemic stroke by promoting neuronal and glial expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 20. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (288 in number) were used to investigate the contribution of HSP20-containing neurons and HSP20-containing glial cells in the exercise-mediated neuroprotection in the stroke condition using middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: Exercise preconditioning, in addition to increasing the numbers of both the HSP20-containg neurons (88 +/- 8 vs. 43 +/- 4; n = 8 each group; P < 0.05) and the HSP20-containg astrocytes (102 +/- 10 vs. 56 +/- 5; n = 8; P < 0.05) significantly attenuated stroke-induced brain infarct (140 +/- 9 vs. 341 +/- 20 mm(3) ; n = 8 per group; P < 0.01), neuronal apoptosis (20 +/- 5 vs. 87 +/- 7; n = 8 per group; n = 8; P < 0.01), glial apoptosis (29 +/- 5 vs. 101 +/- 4; n = 8; P < 0.01), and neurological deficits (6.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 11.7 +/- 0.8; n = 8 per group; P < 0.01).

In vitro experiments and gene-knock out technique have suggested that HPX may have a neuroprotective effect. However, the expression of HPX in the brain was not well elucidated and its expression after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was also poorly studied. Furthermore, no in vivo data were available on the effect of HPX given centrally on the prognosis of focal cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: In the present study, we systematically investigated expression of HPX in normal rat brain by immunofluorescent staining. The results showed that HPX was mainly expressed in vascular system and neurons, as well as in a small portion of astrocytes adjacent to the vessels in normal rat brain. Further, we determined the role of HPX in the process of focal cerebral ischemic injury and explored the effects of HPX treatment in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. After 2 h' middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h' reperfusion, the expression of HPX was increased in the neurons and astrocytes in the penumbra area, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques. Intracerebroventricular injection of HPX at the onset of reperfusion dose-dependently reduced the infarct volumes and improved measurements of neurological function of the rat subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of HPX sustained for up to 7 days after experiments.

In this study, we aimed to demonstrate for the first time that protein level of PDCD5 are related to autophagic activity after focal ischemic brain injury in rats. One hundred and twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats (male) were randomly divided into the following groups: Sham operated, Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAO), MCAO+Control siRNA and MCAO+PDCD5 siRNA. Outcome measurements include neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, brain water content, BBB disruption, MRI and double fluorescence labeling. Western blot and histopathophysiological techniques were used to measure the expression of PDCD5 and some pro-autophagic proteins such as Beclin 1 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. The study found that decreased PDCD5 expression via intracerebroventricular injection of PDCD5 siRNA significantly improved the neurobehavioral outcome, reduced the infarct ratio, cerebral edema and BBB disruption. These results were associated with decreased expression of Beclin 1 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the penumbra area. Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, partially weakened the effect of PDCD5 siRNA.

The enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), controls glycolytic flux. Furthermore, APC/C-Cdh1 plays a crucial role in brain metabolism by regulating PFKFB3 expression. Previous studies have defined the roles of PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis in pathological angiogenesis, cell autophagy, and amyloid plaque deposition in proliferating cells. However, the role of PFKFB3 in reactive astrocyte proliferation after cerebral ischemia is unknown. In this study, we cultured rat primary cortical astrocytes and established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model to mimic cerebral ischemia in vivo. Astrocyte proliferation was measured by western blotting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and by EdU incorporation. We found that OGD/R up-regulated PFKFB3 and PFK1 expression, which was accompanied by reactive astrocyte proliferation. Knockdown of PFKFB3 by siRNA transfection significantly inhibited reactive astrocyte proliferation and lactate release, an indicator of glycolysis. We found that PFKFB3 and PFK1 expression were down-regulated and lactate release was decreased when OGD/R-induced astrocyte proliferation was inhibited by a Cdh1-expressing lentivirus. Thus, reactive astrocyte proliferation can be effectively suppressed by down-regulation of PFKFB3 through control of glycolytic flux, which is downstream of APC/C-Cdh1.",2015,Journal Article,Neurochem Int,Y.

Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTCs) were previously shown to have protective and regenerative effects in animal models of stroke and retinal degeneration, but the underlying therapeutic mechanisms are unknown. Because synaptic dysfunction, synapse loss, degeneration of neuronal processes, and neuronal death are hallmarks of neurological diseases and retinal degenerations, we tested whether hUTCs contribute to tissue repair and regeneration by stimulating synapse formation, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival. To do so, we used a purified rat retinal ganglion cell culture system and found that hUTCs secrete factors that strongly promote excitatory synaptic connectivity and enhance neuronal survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that hUTCs support neurite outgrowth under normal culture conditions and in the presence of the growth-inhibitory proteins chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, myelin basic protein, or Nogo-A (reticulon 4). Furthermore, through biochemical fractionation and pharmacology, we identified the major hUTC-secreted synaptogenic factors as the thrombospondin family proteins (TSPs), TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4. Silencing TSP expression in hUTCs, using small RNA interference, eliminated both the synaptogenic function of these cells and their ability to promote neurite outgrowth. However, the majority of the prosurvival functions of hUTC-conditioned media was spared after TSP knockdown, indicating that hUTCs secrete additional neurotrophic factors. Together, our findings demonstrate that hUTCs affect multiple aspects of neuronal health and connectivity through secreted factors, and each of these paracrine effects may individually contribute to the therapeutic function of these cells. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTC) are currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. These cells show great promise for the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the therapeutic effects of these cells on CNS neurons are not fully understood. Here we provide compelling evidence that hUTCs secrete multiple factors that work synergistically to enhance synapse formation and function, and support neuronal growth and survival. Moreover, we identified thrombospondins (TSPs) as the hUTC-secreted factors that mediate the synaptogenic and growth-promoting functions of these cells. Our findings highlight novel paracrine effects of hUTC on CNS neuron health and connectivity and begin to unravel potential therapeutic mechanisms by which these cells elicit their effects.",2015,Journal Article,J Neurosci,S.

Without emergency treatment, the victim lapses into a coma and death soon follows. The study presented was conducted with a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) setup to assess the effects of brain dysfunction that occurred during heatstroke in mice model (n=6). It was hypothesized that DRS can be utilized in small animal studies to monitor change in internal brain tissue temperature during heatstroke injury since it induces a sequence of pathologic changes that change the tissue composition and structure. Heatstroke was induced by exposure of the mice body under general anesthesia, to a high ambient temperature. A type of DRS in which the brain tissue was illuminated through the intact scalp with a broadband light source and diffuse reflected spectra was employed, taking in the spectral region between 650 and 1000 nm and acquired at an angle of 90 deg at a position on the scalp approximately 12 mm from the illumination site. The temperature at the onset of the experiment was approximately 34 degrees C (rectal temperature) with increasing intervals of 1 degrees C until mouse death. The increase in temperature caused optical scattering signal changes consistent with a structural alteration of brain tissue, ultimately resulting in death. We have found that the peak absorbance intensity and its second derivative at specific wavelengths correlate well with temperature with an exponential dependence. Based on these findings, in order to estimate the influence of temperature on the internal brain tissue a reflectance-temperature index was established and was seen to correlate as well with measured temperature. Overall, results indicate variations in neural tissue properties during heatstroke and the feasibility to monitor and assess internal temperature variations using DRS. Although several approaches have described the rise in temperature and its impact on tissue, to the best of our knowledge no information is available describing the ability to monitor temperature during heatstroke with DRS.

Although the mechanisms of neuroprotection induced by FNS are not entirely understood, important data have been presented in the past two decades. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered group of non-coding small RNA molecules that negatively regulate target gene expression and are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. To date, no studies have demonstrated whether miRNAs can serve as mediators of the brain's response to FNS, which leads to endogenous neuroprotection. Therefore, this study investigated the profiles of FNS-mediated miRNAs. Using a combination of deep sequencing and microarray with computational analysis, we identified a novel miRNA in the rat ischemic cortex after 1 h of FNS. This novel miRNA (PC-3p-3469_406), herein referred to as rno-miR-676-1, was upregulated in rats with cerebral ischemia after FNS. In vivo observations indicate that this novel miRNA may have antiapoptotic effects and contribute to neuroprotection induced by FNS. Our study provides a better understanding of neuroprotection induced by FNS. MicroRNA (miRNA) is defined as a small non-coding RNA that fulfills both the expression and biogenesis criteria.

MATERIAL/METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (total n=160) preconditioned through transfection with either PPARgamma small interfering RNA (siRNA) or lentiviral vector without siRNA and surgically subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion subsequently received VNS treatment at 30 min post-occlusion. The expression of PPARgamma after VNS treatment was measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting, also supported by immunofluorescence staining. Subsequently, the neurological deficits scores, the infarct volume, and the brain histopathology were all evaluated. Additionally, the influence on the pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and neuro-immune cells activation was determined by ELISA and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: We found that VNS upregulated expression of PPARgamma in ischemia penumbra, diminished the extent of ischemic infarct, alleviated neuronal injury, and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and immune cell activation (P<0.05). However, rats with PPARgamma silencing failed to manifest significant neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effect induced by VNS treatment (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PPARgamma may participate in the process by which VNS modulates the neuro-inflammatory response following ischemia/reperfusion in rats.",2015,Journal Article,Med Sci Monit,Y.

Homer is the newly identified scaffolding protein located at PSD and regulates synaptic function. Homer1a, an immediate early gene, has been shown to be induced by several stimulations, such as glutamate, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and trauma. However, whether acidosis mediated by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and hypoxia during cerebral ischemia can change Homer1a expression remains to be determined. RESULTS: We investigated that acidosis and hypoxia selectively and rapidly upregulated Homer1a expression, but not Homer1b/c in cultured cortical neurons. We also found that Homer1a exhibited induction expression in brain cortex of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Additionally, acid-evoked Homer1a mRNA induction depended on extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt activity, and ASIC1a-mediated calcium influx whereas hypoxia depended only on ERK1/2 activity. Also, we demonstrated that continuous acidosis and hypoxia resulted in pronounced cell injury and Homer1a knockdown with small interfering RNA aggravated this damage induced by 3 h acid and hypoxia incubation in neuro-2a cells. CONCLUSION: Homer1a might act as an activity-dependent regulator responding to extracellular stimuli during cerebral ischemia.",2014,Journal Article,CNS Neurosci Ther,J. J.

This in vivo study in mice investigated the effect of NT-1 hyperexpression on focal angiogenesis and long-term functional outcome after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). METHODS: Adeno-associated viral vectors carrying either the NT-1 gene (AAV-NT-1) or GFP (AAV-GFP) were generated and injected into the brains of separate groups of 93 mice. Seven days later, tMCAO followed by 7-28 days of reperfusion were carried out. Histological outcomes and behavioral deficits were quantified 7-28 days after tMCAO. Small cerebral vessel network and angiogenesis were assessed 28 days after tMCAO, using synchrotron radiation microangiography and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed that on the day of tMCAO, NT-1 hyperexpression had been achieved in both normal and ischemic hemispheres. Immunofluorescence imaging showed that NT-1 expression was primarily in neurons and astrocytes. Ischemia-induced infarction in the NT-1 hyperexpression group was attenuated in comparison to saline or AAV-GFP-treated groups (P<0.01). Similarly, neurological deficits were greatly improved in AAV-NT-1-treated mice compared with mice in saline or AAV-GFP-treated groups (P<0.05). In addition, angiogenesis was increased in AAV-NT-1-treated mice compared with the other 2 groups (P<0.05). In vivo synchrotron radiation microangiography 28 days after tMCAO revealed more branches in AAV-NT-1-treated mice than in other groups. CONCLUSIONS: AAV-NT-1 induced NT-1 hyperexpression before tMCAO reduced infarct size, enhanced neovascularization, and improved long-term functional recovery.",2012,Journal Article,Stroke,H.

Yet the mammalian brain appears to have an impressive tolerance to experimental microembolization with ischemia occurring only after the injection of large numbers of particulates. Potential explanations could be that the majority of these particulates marginate along the pial vasculature or escape the cerebral circulation via arteriovenous (AV) fistulae. METHODS: To test these theories, we first established the level of injury created by the injection of 20, 45, and 90 mum fluorescent microspheres in Sprague-Dawley rats. Brains were examined by immunohistochemistry for injury and for infarction. We then injected 1000 size 20 mum, 500 size 45 mum, and 150 size 90 mum and harvested the brains and lungs for assays of fluorescence. The location of microemboli within the brain was established by determining the percent of 20 and 45 mum fluorescent microspheres entering the superficial versus deeper layers of the brain. The location of larger microemboli was established by 2T-MRI after injection of 60-100 mum microthrombi labeled with supraparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles. RESULTS: With 20 mum microspheres there were no areas of injury or infarction after injection of 500 and rare areas of injury and no infarctions after injection of 1000 microspheres. With either 250 or 500 size 45 mum microspheres there were a few (</= 6) small areas of injury per animal with </= 2 areas of infarction. After injection, 93%-96% of injected microspheres remained in the brain. Approximately 40% of either fluorescent or SPIO labeled microthrombi were found on the brain surface. CONCLUSIONS: As in humans, the rat brain has an impressive tolerance to microemboli, although this clearly varies with emboli size and number. Wash out of particulates through AV connections is not a major factor in brain tolerance in this model. Approximately 40% of microemboli remain in the larger pial vasculature where the more extensive collateralization may limit their effects on distal perfusion.

Proper degradation of aged and damaged mitochondria through mitophagy is a key cellular pathway for mitochondrial quality control. Recent studies have indicated that PINK1/Parkin-mediated pathways ensure mitochondrial integrity and function. Translocation of Parkin to damaged mitochondria induces mitophagy in many nonneuronal cell types. However, evidence showing Parkin translocation in primary neurons is controversial, leaving unanswered questions as to how and where Parkin-mediated mitophagy occurs in neurons. Here, we report the unique process of dissipating mitochondrial Deltapsi(m)-induced and Parkin-mediated mitophagy in mature cortical neurons. Compared with nonneuronal cells, neuronal mitophagy is a much slower and compartmentally restricted process, coupled with reduced anterograde mitochondrial transport. Parkin-targeted mitochondria are accumulated in the somatodendritic regions where mature lysosomes are predominantly located. Time-lapse imaging shows dynamic formation and elimination of Parkin- and LC3-ring-like structures surrounding depolarized mitochondria through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the soma. Knocking down Parkin in neurons impairs the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria. Thus, our study provides neuronal evidence for dynamic and spatial Parkin-mediated mitophagy, which will help us understand whether altered mitophagy contributes to pathogenesis of several major neurodegenerative diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired transport.",2012,Journal Article,Curr Biol,Q.

Biologic TNF inhibitors (TNFIs), such as the etanercept, cannot be developed as new stroke treatments because these large molecule drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI was engineered by fusion of the type II human TNF receptor (TNFR) to each heavy chain of a genetically engineered chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the mouse transferrin receptor (TfR), designated as cTfRMAb-TNFR fusion protein. The cTfRMAb domain of the fusion protein acts as a molecular Trojan horse to deliver the fused TNFR across the BBB. Etanercept or the cTfRMAb-TNFR fusion protein (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously in adult mice subjected to 1-hour reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion up to 90 minutes after the occlusion. Neuroprotection was assessed at 24 hours or 7 days after occlusion. The cTfRMAb-TNFR fusion protein treatment caused a significant 45%, 48%, 42%, and 54% reduction in hemispheric, cortical, and subcortical stroke volumes, and neural deficit, respectively.

NFI has been successfully applied in a number of animal disease models including cancer, arthritis, and stroke. Furthermore, several applications in humans have been described. NFI is widely available in research laboratories because it has a number of advantages: It uses non-ionizing radiation and requires comparably simple, inexpensive instrumentation, and easy to handle. Fluorochromes can be detected with high sensitivity, and image acquisition time is relatively short. Furthermore, a plethora of fluorescent imaging agents is available including unspecific, target-specific, and activatable imaging probes. With these probes, biological processes such as inflammation, cell death or enzyme activity, and many others can be visualized in living animals.

We hypothesized that imaging thrombus directly would allow this variability to be controlled. METHODS: We optically labeled thrombi with a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probe C15 that is covalently linked to fibrin by factor-XIIIa. Labeled thrombus was injected into the left distal internal carotid artery (ICA) of C57/BL6 mice (n=47), near its bifurcation, and laser-Doppler cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) was assessed for 30 minutes. NIRF thrombus imaging was done ex vivo at 24 hours. RESULTS: CBF variably decreased to 43.9+/-17.3% at 5 minutes (rCBF; 11.2 approximately 80.4%). NIRF thrombus imaging at 24 hours showed variability in distribution (ICA bifurcation, adjacent and/or remote areas) and burden (2279+/-1270 pixels; 0 approximately 5940 pixels). Final infarct size was also variable (21.0+/-10.3%; 4.7 approximately 60.3% of the bihemispheric volume). Despite this heterogeneity, a strong thrombus-infarct correlation was maintained. The left hemispheric target infarct size (% of the hemisphere) correlated with thrombus burden, as a stronger predictor of infarct volume (P<0.001, r=0.50) than rCBF (P=0.02, r=-0.34). The infarct size was best predicted by a combination of thrombus imaging and CBF: left-hemispheric big-thrombi (>1865 pixels)/low-rCBF (</=42%) had an infarct volume of 56.9+/-10.4% (n=12), big-thrombi/high-rCBF had 45.9+/-23.5% (n=11), small-thrombi/low-rCBF 35.7+/-17.3% (n=11) and small-thrombi/ high-rCBF 27.3+/-16.4% (n=12).

Cerebral ischemia initiates a complex cascade of events at genomic, molecular, and cellular levels, and inflammation is important in this cascade. In 1993 for For the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), Adams et al] conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded study of the low-molecular-weight heparinoid given to patients within 24 hours after stroke and developed a system for diagnosis of subtype of ischemic stroke that uses components of existing diagnostic schemes. The type of acute ischemic stroke was classified according to the TOAST classification: 1) Large Artery AtheroSclerosis (LAAS); 2) CardioEmbolic Infarct (CEI); 3) LACunar infarct (LAC); 4) stroke of Other Determined Etiology (ODE); 5) stroke of UnDetermined Etiology (UDE) (see Fig. (1)). On the basis of pathophysiologic differences of each stroke subtype it's possible to hypothesize a different pattern of immuno-inflammatory activation in relation of ischemic stroke subtype. A nonspecific systemic inflammatory response occurs after both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, either as part of the process of brain damage or in response to complications such as deep venous thrombosis. Several studies have reported that higher levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with worse outcome after ischemic stroke. Our group reported that patients with cardioembolic subtype showed significantly higher median plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta whereas the lacunar subtype showed significantly lower median plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta. Our findings underlined the significant association was noted between the severity of neurological deficit at admission, the diagnostic subtype and some inflammatory variables.",2012,Journal Article,Curr Pharm Des,A.

However, physiologic and connectional plasticity of sensory maps during long-term functional recovery in the mouse have not been determined. Using a photothrombotic stroke model, we targeted the motor cortex, which we show results in lasting behavioral deficits on the grid-walking and in the cylinder tasks out to 8 weeks after stroke. Mice recovered performance in a skilled reaching task, showing no deficit from week 2 after stroke. Long-term optical intrinsic signal imaging revealed functional reorganization of sensory cortical maps for both forelimb and hindlimb, with more diffuse sensory physiologic maps. There was a small but significant increase in motor neuron projections within the areas of functional cortical reorganization as assessed using the neuroanatomic tracer biotinylated dextran amine. These findings show that the sensorimotor cortex undergoes remapping of cortical functions and axonal sprouting within the same regions during recovery after stroke.

D-serine signaling represents an important pharmacological target for treating these diseases; however, the biochemical mechanisms controlling extracellular D-serine levels in vivo are still unclear. D-serine heteroexchange through small neutral amino acid transporters has been shown in cell cultures and brain slices and could provide a biochemical mechanism for the control of D-serine extracellular concentration in vivo. Alternatively, exocytotic D-serine release has also been proposed. In this study, the dynamics of D-serine release and clearance were explored in vivo on a second-by-second time scale using microelectrode biosensors. The rate of D-serine clearance in the rat frontal cortex after a microionophoretic injection revealed a transporter-mediated uptake mechanism. D-serine uptake was blocked by small neutral l-amino acids, implicating alanine-serine-cysteine (ASC) transporters, in particular high affinity Asc-1 and low affinity ASCT2 transporters. Interestingly, changes in alanine, serine, or threonine levels resulted in D-serine release through ASC transporters. Asc-1, but not ASCT2, appeared to release D-serine in response to changes in amino acid concentrations. Finally, neuronal silencing by tetrodotoxin increased D-serine extracellular concentration by an ASC-transporter-dependent mechanism. Together, these results indicate that D-serine heteroexchange through ASC transporters is present in vivo and may constitute a key component in the regulation of D-serine extracellular concentration.",2013,Journal Article,ACS Chem Neurosci,C.

DATA SYNTHESIS: When reviewing the literature for appropriate studies it turned out that vascular involvement in MIDs includes primary or secondary micro- or macroangiopathy of the cerebral, cervical, and retinal arteries, the aorta, the iliac arteries, the brachial arteries, or the muscular arteries. Arteriopathy in MIDs manifests as atherosclerosis, stenosis, occlusion, dissection, ectasia, aneurysm formation, or arteriovenous malformation. Direct evidence for primary cerebral microangiopathy comes from histological studies and indirect evidence from imaging and perfusion studies of the brain. Microangiopathy of the retina is highly prevalent in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Macroangiopathy of the carotid arteries may be complicated by stroke. Arteriopathy of the aorta may result in ectasia, aneurysm formation, or even rupture. Further evidence for arteriopathy in MIDs comes from the frequent association of migraine with MIDs and the occurrence of premature atherosclerosis in MID patients without classical risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial arteriopathy most frequently concerns the cerebral arteries and may result from the underlying metabolic defect or secondary from associated vascular risk factors.

In our previous studies, leucocyte filtration during cardiopulmonary bypass reduced cerebrocortical adherent leucocyte count and mitigated cerebral damage after hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) in piglets. This study aimed to obtain and assess direct visual data of leucocyte behaviour in cerebral vessels after hypothermic circulatory arrest following remote ischaemic preconditioning. METHODS: Twelve native stock piglets were randomized into a remote ischaemic preconditioning group (n = 6) and a control group (n = 6). The intervention group underwent hind-leg ischaemia, whereas the control group received a sham-treatment before a 60-min period of hypothermic circulatory arrest. An intravital microscope was used to obtain measurements from the cerebrocortical vessel in vivo. It included three sets of filters: a violet filter to visualize microvascular perfusion and vessel diameter, a green filter for visualization of rhodamine-labelled leucocytes and an ultraviolet filter for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analysis. The final magnification on the microscope was 400. After the experiment, cerebral and cerebellar biopsies were collected and analysed with transmission electron microscope by a blinded analyst. RESULTS: In the transmission electron microscope analysis, the entire intervention group had normal, unaffected rough endoplasmic reticulum's in their cerebellar tissue, whereas the control group had a mean score of 1.06 (standard deviation 0.41) (P = 0.026). The measured amount of adherent leucocytes was lower in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group. The difference was statistically significant at 5, 15 and 45 min after circulatory arrest. Statistically significant differences were seen also in the recovery phase at 90 and 120 min after reperfusion. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide autofluorescence had statistically significant differences at 10 min after cooling and at 120 and 180 min after hypothermic circulatory arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Remote ischaemic preconditioning seems to provide better mitochondrial respiratory chain function as indicated by the higher NADH content. It simultaneously provides a reduction of adherent leucocytes in cerebral vessels after hypothermic circulatory arrest.

During a transient ischaemic attack it is assumed that the affected tissue is penumbral but rescued by early spontaneous reperfusion. There is, however, evidence from rodent studies that even brief focal ischaemia not resulting in tissue infarction can cause extensive selective neuronal loss associated with long-lasting sensorimotor impairment but normal magnetic resonance imaging. Selective neuronal loss might therefore contribute to the increasingly recognized cognitive impairment occurring in patients with transient ischaemic attacks. It is therefore relevant to consider treatments to reduce brain damage occurring with transient ischaemic attacks. As penumbral neurons are threatened by markedly constrained oxygen delivery, improving the latter by increasing arterial O2 content would seem logical. Despite only small increases in arterial O2 content, normobaric oxygen therapy experimentally induces significant increases in penumbral O2 pressure and by such may maintain the penumbra alive until reperfusion. Nevertheless, the effects of normobaric oxygen therapy on infarct volume in rodent models have been conflicting, although duration of occlusion appeared an important factor. Likewise, in the single randomized trial published to date, early-administered normobaric oxygen therapy had no significant effect on clinical outcome despite reduced diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth during therapy. Here we tested the hypothesis that normobaric oxygen therapy prevents both selective neuronal loss and sensorimotor deficits in a rodent model mimicking true transient ischaemic attack. Normobaric oxygen therapy was applied from the onset and until completion of 15 min distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, a strain representative of the transient ischaemic attack-prone population. Whereas normoxic controls showed normal magnetic resonance imaging but extensive cortical selective neuronal loss associated with microglial activation (present both at Day 14 in vivo and at Day 28 post-mortem) and marked and long-lasting sensorimotor deficits, normobaric oxygen therapy completely prevented sensorimotor deficit (P < 0.02) and near-completely Day 28 selective neuronal loss (P < 0.005). Microglial activation was substantially reduced at Day 14 and completely prevented at Day 28 (P = 0.002). Our findings document that normobaric oxygen therapy administered during ischaemia nearly completely prevents the neuronal death, microglial inflammation and sensorimotor impairment that characterize this rodent true transient ischaemic attack model. Taken together with the available literature, normobaric oxygen therapy appears a promising therapy for short-lasting ischaemia, and is attractive clinically as it could be started at home in at-risk patients or in the ambulance in subjects suspected of transient ischaemic attack/early stroke.

The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the efficacy of acute antiplatelet loading on stroke outcome in the rabbit small clot embolic model. METHODS: Sixty male New Zealand white rabbits were embolized via small clots into the middle cerebral artery. Two hours later, animals were treated with (1) aspirin (5 mg/kg; n=20); (2) usual dual antiplatelet loading (aspirin 10 mg/kg+clopidogrel 10 mg/kg; n=20); or (3) high-dose dual antiplatelet loading (aspirin 10 mg/kg+clopidogrel 30 mg/kg; n=20). The coprimary outcomes were as follows: (1) platelet inhibition and (2) behavioral outcome as measured by the P50 (milligrams of clot that leads to neurological dysfunction in 50% of animals in a group). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in 3-hour arachidonic acid and ADP (P<0.011); 6-hour collagen and ADP (P<0.01, P<0.01); and 24-hour collagen, arachidonic acid, and ADP (P=0.02, P<0.01, P<0.01) platelet inhibition. The behavioral outcome was significantly better in the usual dual antiplatelet loading versus aspirin group (P=0.02).

The present study was designed to identify whether miR376b5p is involved in angiogenesis following cerebral ischemia and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. A rat MCAO model was established and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the mRNA expression level of miR376b5p for 1 to 7 days. In addition, the density of microvessels and the relative mRNA and protein levels of hypoxiainducible factor1 alpha (HIF1alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Notch1 were measured. The miR376b5p mimic or the miR376b5p inhibitor were transfected into hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the proliferation, migration and tube formation were measured. To further examine the underlying mechanisms, shRNA was transfected into cells to knock down HIF1alpha, and angiogenesis and the expression of associated molecules, including HIF1alpha, VEGFA and Notch1 were compared between each group. Our results demonstrated that miR376b5p repressed angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and miR376b5p inhibited angiogenesis in HUVECs by targeting the HIF1alphamediated VEGFA/Notch1 signaling pathway.

CSVD leads to slowly increasing cognitive and functional deficits but may also cause stroke-like symptoms, if vessels in critical brain areas are affected. Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) exhibit several vascular risk factors, develop infarcts and hemorrhages and therefore represent a relevant model for the study of CSVD. Using this animal model, we recently demonstrated that intravasal accumulations of erythrocytes, we interpreted as stases, stand at the beginning of a pathological vascular cascade. After stases microbleeds occur, which are followed by reactive microthromboses. Bleeds and thromboses finally cause hemorrhagic infarcts. Immunohistochemical stainings show, that plasma proteins like IgG are deposited in the walls of vessels affected by stases. Further, we found small clots and thread-shaped aggregations of thrombocytes as well as thread-shaped structures of von Willebrand-Factor within stases. Thus, we conclude that blood-brain barrier damages occur in the neighborhood of stases and stases seem to be associated with a restricted activation of blood coagulation without formation of obstructive thromboses.

METHODS: We used 41 C57BL/6J mice for the experiment. Fourteen mice were used as sham group (no ischemia and reperfusion, no medication); an ischemia (induced by 15-minute occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries) and reperfusion (I/R) group (n = 17); and an I/R + cilostazol (I/R + CZ) group (receiving 30 mg/kg of cilostazol orally at 30 minutes before ischemia) (n = 10). A cranial window was prepared in the right parietal region. Platelets obtained from donor mice were labeled with a fluorescent dye (carboxyfluorescein iodoacetate succinimidyl ester) in vitro. Labeled platelets were intravenously administered at 3 or 6 hours after reperfusion, and then platelet behavior (rolling and adhesion) in the brain microvessels was observed. The numbers of rolling and adhering platelets in the arteriole and venule were calculated.

Clinical drugs are not available for WML. We investigated whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone, with properties of vascular protection and antiinflammation, exerts beneficial effect in hypertensive WML rats. METHODS: Stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) were treated with pioglitazone for 12 weeks. Morris water maze experiment was conducted to assess cognition. WML was observed by Luxol fast blue staining. Smooth muscle actin-alpha, collagen I, collagen IV, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in brain and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in serum were detected. RESULTS: Pioglitazone significantly attenuated WML in corpus callosum, caudate putamen, external capsule, and internal capsule. Cognitive impairment in RHRSP was ameliorated by pioglitazone. Pioglitazone attenuated arteriolar remodeling and reduced sICAM-1 level in serum. Pioglitazone decreased the proliferation of microglia and astrocyte and lowered the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the white matter.

However, differences in genetic background cause wide variation in collateral number and diameter in mice, resulting in large variation in protection. Indirect estimates of collateral perfusion suggest that wide variation also exists in humans. Unfortunately, methods used to obtain these estimates are invasive and not widely available. We sought to determine whether differences in genetic background in mice result in variation in branch patterning of the retinal arterial circulation, and whether these differences predict strain-dependent differences in pial collateral extent and severity of ischemic stroke. Retinal patterning metrics, collateral extent, and infarct volume were obtained for 10 strains known to differ widely in collateral extent. Multivariate regression was conducted, and model performance was assessed using K-fold cross-validation. Twenty-one metrics varied with strain (p<0.01). Ten metrics (e.g., bifurcation angle, lacunarity, optimality) predicted collateral number and diameter across seven regression models, with the best model closely predicting (p<0.0001) number (+/-1.2-3.4 collaterals, K-fold R2=0.83-0.98), diameter (+/-1.2-1.9 mum, R2=0.73-0.88), and infarct volume (+/-5.1 mm3, R2=0.85-0.87). An analogous set of the most predictive metrics, obtained for the middle cerebral artery (MCA) tree in a subset of the above strains, also predicted (p<0.0001) collateral number (+/-3.3 collaterals, K-fold R2=0.78) and diameter (+/-1.6 mum, R2=0.86). Thus, differences in arterial branch patterning in the retina and the MCA trees are specified by genetic background and predict variation in collateral extent and stroke severity. If also true in human, and since genetic variation in cerebral collaterals extends to other tissues at least in mice, a similar ""retinal predictor index"" could serve as a non- or minimally invasive biomarker for collateral extent in brain and other tissues.

Finding novel molecules to regulate neuroinflammation is of significant clinical value. We have previously shown that adjudin, a small molecule compound known to possess antispermatogenic function, attenuates microglia activation by suppression of the NF-kappaB pathway. In this study we continued to explore whether adjudin could be neuroprotective by using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. Adjudin treatment after reperfusion significantly decreased the infarction volume and neuroscore compared to the vehicle group. Staining of CD11b showed that adjudin markedly inhibited microglial activation in both the cortex and the striatum, accompanied by a reduction in the expression and release of cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. Concomitantly, adjudin noticeably prevented BBB disruption after ischemia and reperfusion, as indicated by the reduction of IgG detection in the brain cortex and striatum versus the vehicle group. This finding was also corroborated by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting of tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, JAM-A and Occludin, where the reduction of these proteins could be attenuated by adjudin treatment. Moreover, adjudin obviously inhibited the elevated MMP-9 activity after stroke.

The only stroke trial for neuroprotectants that showed benefit to patients targeted this ternary complex. NOS1AP/nNOS interaction regulates small GTPases, iron transport, p38MAPK-linked excitotoxicity, and anxiety. Moreover, the nos1ap gene is linked to disorders from schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and autism to cardiovascular disorders and breast cancer. Understanding protein interactions required for NOS1AP function, therefore, has broad implications for numerous diseases. Here we show that the interaction of NOS1AP with nNOS differs radically from the classical PDZ docking assumed to be responsible. The NOS1AP PDZ motif does not bind nNOS as measured by multiple methods. In contrast, full-length NOS1AP forms an unusually stable interaction with nNOS. We mapped the discrepancy between full-length and C-terminal PDZ motif to a novel internal region we call the ExF motif. The C-terminal PDZ motif, although neither sufficient nor necessary for binding, nevertheless promotes the stability of the complex. It therefore potentially affects signal transduction and suggests that functional interaction of nNOS with NOS1AP might be targetable at two distinct sites. We demonstrate that excitotoxic pathways can be regulated, in cortical neuron and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from rat, either by the previously described PDZ ligand TAT-GESV or by the ExF motif-bearing region of NOS1AP, even when lacking the critical PDZ residues as long as the ExF motif is intact and not mutated. This previously unrecognized heterodivalent interaction of nNOS with NOS1AP may therefore provide distinct opportunities for pharmacological intervention in NOS1AP-dependent signaling and excitotoxicity.",2015,Journal Article,J Neurosci,L.

We hypothesized that recombinant FSTL1 attenuates neuronal apoptosis through its receptor disco-interacting protein 2 homolog A (DIP2A) and the Akt pathway after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. METHODS: One hundred forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 hours of MCAO followed by reperfusion. In a subset of animals, the time course and location of FSTL1 and DIP2A were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence double staining. Another set of animals were intracerebroventricularly given either recombinant FSTL1 1 hour after reperfusion or FSTL1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) 48 hours before reperfusion. Additionally, DIP2A was knockdown by siRNA in some animals. Infarction volume and neurological deficits were measured, and the expression of FSTL1, DIP2A, phosphorylated Akt, cleaved caspase-3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling were quantified using Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of FSTL1 and DIP2A was increased in neurons and peaked 24 hours after MCAO. Recombinant FSTL1 reduced brain infarction and improved neurological deficits 24 and 72 hours after MCAO via activation of its receptor DIP2A and downstream phosphorylation of Akt. These effects were reversed by DIP2A-siRNA and FSTL1-siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant FSTL1 decreases neuronal apoptosis and improves neurological deficits through phosphorylation of Akt by activation of its receptor DIP2A after MCAO in rats.

Evidence-based data demonstrate the benefits and safety of statin therapy and help to guide clinicians in the management of populations at high risk of CVD. Nevertheless, clinical trials, meta-analyses and observational studies highlight a 10-12% increase in new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) among patients receiving statins. The risk further increases with intensive therapy and among individuals with known risk factors for NODM. Mechanisms underpinning this effect are not yet fully understood; however, Mendelian randomization studies suggest that they are related to lowered activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the target of statin therapy. In vitro research indicates that statins potentially impair beta-cell function and decrease insulin sensitivity but how these findings relate to patients is unknown. In the clinic, statins should be prescribed on the basis of CVD risk and individual patient characteristics. In addition, diet and lifestyle interventions should be emphasized to help mitigate the risk of NODM. Individuals who develop NODM while taking statins do not exhibit increased microvascular disease, which is reassuring.

We aimed to explore the effects of chronic low-mercury concentration on vascular function in cerebral arteries and the mechanisms involved. Basilar arteries from control (vehicle-saline solution, im) and mercury chloride (HgCl2)-treated rats for 30 days (first dose 4.6mug/kg, subsequent dose 0.07mug/kg/day, im, to cover daily loss) were used. Vascular reactivity, protein expression, nitric oxide (NO) levels and superoxide anion (O2(-)) production were analyzed. HgCl2 exposure increased serotonin contraction and reduced the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to bradykinin. After NO synthase inhibition, serotonin responses were enhanced more in control than in mercury-treated rats while bradykinin-induced relaxation was abolished. NO levels were greater in control than Hg-treated rats. Tiron and indomethacin reduced vasoconstriction and increased the bradykinin-induced relaxation only in HgCl2-treated rats. Vascular O2(-) production was greater in mercury-treated when compared to control rats. Protein expressions of endothelial NO synthase, copper/zinc (Cu/Zn), Manganese (Mn) and extracellular-superoxide dismutases were similar in cerebral arteries from both groups. Results suggest that Hg treatment increases cerebrovascular reactivity by reducing endothelial negative modulation and NO bioavailability; this effect seems to be dependent on increased reactive oxygen species and prostanoids generation.

NOTCH3 loss of function has been demonstrated for few mutations. However, whether this finding applies to all mutations and whether a loss-of-function mechanism drives the manifestations of the disease remain yet unknown. This study investigated the in vivo functionality of the Arg169Cys archetypal mutation. METHODS: We used mice with constitutive or conditional reduction of NOTCH3 activity, mice harboring the Arg169Cys mutation at the endogenous Notch3 locus (Notch3Arg170Cys), and mice overexpressing the Arg169Cys NOTCH3 mutant (TgPAC-Notch3R169C) on either a Notch3 wild-type or a null background. NOTCH3 activity was monitored in the brain arteries by measuring the expression of NOTCH3 target genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Notch3ECD deposits were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Brain parenchyma was analyzed for vacuolation and myelin debris in the white matter and infarcts. RESULTS: We identified a subset of genes appropriate to detect NOTCH3 haploinsufficiency in the adult. Expression of these genes was unaltered in Notch3Arg170Cys mice, despite marked Notch3ECD deposits. Elimination of wild-type NOTCH3 did not influence the onset and burden of white matter lesions in 20-month-old TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice, and 20-month-old Notch3-null mice exhibited neither infarct nor white matter changes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide strong evidence that cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy can develop without impairment of NOTCH3 signaling and argue against a loss of NOTCH3 function as a general driving mechanism for white matter lesions in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy.",2014,Journal Article,Stroke,E.

The present study investigated the impact of age and sex on miRNA expression following ischaemic stroke in an animal model. Adult (6 month) and middle-aged (11-12 months) female and male rats were subject to MCAo (middle cerebral artery occlusion) using ET-1 (endothelin-1). Circulating miRNAs were analysed in blood samples at 2 and 5 days post-stroke, and brain miRNAs were analysed at 5 days post-stroke. Although stroke-associated infarction was observed in all groups, infarct volume and sensory-motor deficits were significantly reduced in adult females compared with middle-aged females, adult males or middle-aged males. At 2 days post-stroke, 21 circulating miRNAs were differentially regulated and PCA (principal component analysis) confirmed that most of the variance was due to age. At 5 days post-stroke, 78 circulating miRNAs exhibited significantly different regulation, and most of the variance was associated with sex. A small cohort (five) of miRNAs, miR-15a, miR-19b, miR-32 miR-136 and miR-199a-3p, were found to be highly expressed exclusively in adult females compared with middle-aged females, adult males and middle-aged males. Predicted gene targets for these five miRNAs analysed for KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways revealed that the top ten KEGG pathways were related to growth factor signalling, cell structure and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling.

However, current hormone therapies cannot be used safely to treat these conditions commonly associated with menopause because of detrimental side effects in the periphery. The latter also prevents the use of the hormone for neuroprotection. We show that a small-molecule bioprecursor prodrug, 10beta,17beta-dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED), converts to 17beta-estradiol in the brain after systemic administration but remains inert in the rest of the body. The localized and rapid formation of estrogen from the prodrug was revealed by a series of in vivo bioanalytical assays and through in vivo imaging in rodents. DHED treatment efficiently alleviated symptoms that originated from brain estrogen deficiency in animal models of surgical menopause and provided neuroprotection in a rat stroke model. Concomitantly, we determined that 17beta-estradiol formed in the brain from DHED elicited changes in gene expression and neuronal morphology identical to those obtained after direct 17beta-estradiol treatment. Together, complementary functional and mechanistic data show that our approach is highly relevant therapeutically, because administration of the prodrug selectively produces estrogen in the brain independently from the route of administration and treatment regimen. Therefore, peripheral responses associated with the use of systemic estrogens, such as stimulation of the uterus and estrogen-responsive tumor growth, were absent. Collectively, our brain-selective prodrug approach may safely provide estrogen neuroprotection and medicate neurological and psychiatric symptoms developing from estrogen deficiency, particularly those encountered after surgical menopause, without the adverse side effects of current hormone therapies.",2015,Journal Article,Sci Transl Med,L.

We recently described that ischemic brain injury decreases cerebral GRK2 levels. Here we studied the effect of astrocyte GRK2-deficiency on neonatal brain damage in vivo. As astrocytes protect neurons by taking up glutamate via plasma-membrane transporters, we also studied the effect of GRK2 on the localization of the GLutamate ASpartate Transporter (GLAST). Brain damage induced by hypoxia-ischemia was significantly reduced in GFAP-GRK2(+/-) mice, which have a 60% reduction in astrocyte GRK2 compared to GFAP-WT littermates. In addition, GRK2-deficient astrocytes have higher plasma-membrane levels of GLAST and an increased capacity to take up glutamate in vitro. In search for the mechanism by which GRK2 regulates GLAST expression, we observed increased GFAP levels in GRK2-deficient astrocytes. GFAP and the cytoskeletal protein ezrin are known regulators of GLAST localization. In line with this evidence, GRK2-deficiency reduced phosphorylation of the GRK2 substrate ezrin and enforced plasma-membrane GLAST association after stimulation with the group I mGluR-agonist DHPG. When ezrin was silenced, the enhanced plasma-membrane GLAST association in DHPG-exposed GRK2-deficient astrocytes was prevented. In conclusion, we identified a novel role of astrocyte GRK2 in regulating plasma-membrane GLAST localization via an ezrin-dependent route. We demonstrate that the 60% reduction in astrocyte GRK2 protein level that is observed in GFAP-GRK2(+/-) mice is sufficient to significantly reduce neonatal ischemic brain damage. These findings underline the critical role of GRK2 regulation in astrocytes for dampening the extent of brain damage after ischemia.",2013,Journal Article,Neurobiol Dis,C. H.

METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomized equally into ischemia and sham-operated groups, and right middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in the former group. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells and Foxp3 expression, respectively, in the peripheral blood and brain tissue at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after modeling. The behavioral changes of the rats were evaluated using an improved NSS neurological functional scoring system. RESULTS: The neurological function scores of the two groups both gradually declined after the operation, and showed significant differences between the two groups at all the time points of measurement (P<0.01). The CD4(+)CD25 T cells in the peripheral blood were similar between the two group at 1 and 3 days after the operation (P>0.05), but increased significantly in the ischemia group at 7 and 14 days (P<0.05) with an inverse correlation to the neurological scores (r=-0.68, P=0.01). Immunohistochemistry detected the presence of Foxp3 primarily in the ischemic region of the brain tissue 1 day after cerebral ischemia; the contralateral hemisphere also showed a small quantity of Foxp3 expression. No Foxp3 expression was detected in the brain tissue of the sham-operated group.

The LPS response gene (Lrg) is a recently identified gene in human dental pulp cells treated with LPS. However, the role and mechanism of Lrg in brain ischemia injury have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we sought to determine whether Lrg participates in LPS preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury. The Lrg protein accumulates in brain tissue after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Furthermore, knockdown of Lrg by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly increased the infarct size of brain injury. In addition, we investigated the mechanism of Lrg in brain ischemia injury. Lrg-siRNA could regulate inflammatory cytokine expression. Moreover, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 protein levels were significantly increased by Lrg-siRNA in mice after MCAO. Conversely, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) protein level was decreased by Lrg-siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that Lrg regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS preconditioning-induced brain ischemia injury via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway.

However, the source of age-related chronic vascular inflammation remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that cell-autonomous mechanisms contribute to the proinflammatory changes in vascular phenotype that accompanies advancing age, we analyzed the cytokine secretion profile of primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from young ( approximately 13 years old) and aged ( approximately 21 years old) Macaca mulatta. Aged VSMCs cultured in the absence of systemic factors exhibited significantly increased secretion of interleukin-1beta, MCP-1, and tumor necrosis factoralpha compared with young control cells. Secretion of interleukin-6 also tended to increase in aged VSMCs. This age-associated proinflammatory shift in the cellular secretory phenotype was associated with an increased mitochondrial O(2)(-) production and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activation. Treatment of aged VSMCs with a physiologically relevant concentration of resveratrol (1 muM) exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects, reversing aging-induced alterations in the cellular cytokine secretion profile and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells. Resveratrol also attenuated mitochondrial O(2)(-) production and upregulated the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in aged VSMCs. Thus, in non-human primates, cell-autonomous activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and expression of an inflammatory secretome likely contribute to vascular inflammation in aging. Resveratrol treatment prevents the proinflammatory properties of the aged VSMC secretome, an effect that likely contributes to the demonstrated vasoprotective action of resveratrol in animal models of aging.",2012,Journal Article,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,A.

Post-treatment of DMBC still produced neuroprotective effects even when administered at 6h after ischemia. In the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced astrocytes or HT22 cell injury, DMBC treatment decreased the OGD-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and increased the GFAP levels in astrocytes. In addition, Annexin-V-Fluos staining analysis revealed that DMBC treatment attenuated both OGD-induced apoptosis and necrosis in astrocytes. Western blotting analysis showed DMBC treatment inhibited the ischemia or OGD-induced increases in active cathepsin B in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes or HT22 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that DMBC treatment blocked the ischemia or OGD-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes or HT22 cells.

The focal cerebral ischemia rat models were produced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. The MCAO group was further equally divided into five subgroups at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr, and the sham operated rats were used as controls.

The neurologic scores were 0 for all the rats in the control group and 2-3 for those in the MCAO group, suggesting that rat models were established successfully. The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, the impelling force in MCAO rats was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), reaching the lowest level at 24 hr. Damage to the intestinal mucosa, including villus intestinalis, vacuolar degeneration of organelles, widened cell-cell junctions, and apoptotic cells could be found under the light and electron microscopy.

Significant success has recently been reported with compounds such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and more recently in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). The success these agents have demonstrated is now being reflected by a narrowing of new FXa patents over the past few years. The new patents appear to be structural modifications of previously published, small molecule inhibitors and bind in a similar manner to the FXa enzyme.

The immunoreactivity of low molecular mass peptide 2 (LMP2) and low molecular mass peptide 7 (LMP7) was evident in the ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex and striatum following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Both LMP2 and LMP7 increased as early as 4 h after the MCAO, further increased at 24 h, peaked at 72 h and decreased 7 days later. LMP2 and LMP7 were mainly present in astrocytes and microglia/macrophage cells, respectively. LMP2 knockdown by shRNA (short hairpin RNA) markedly reduced the levels of LMP2 and LMP7 protein and caused 75.5 and 78.6% decrease in the caspase-like (C-L) and chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activities, respectively. Compared with cont-shRNA group (39.7%, infarction volumes/total ipsilateral hemisphere), the infarction volumes were reduced to 22.5% in LMP2-shRNA group. Additionally, LMP2 knockdown significantly reduced activated astrocytes and microglia, the expression nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and caused less accumulation of ischemia-induced protein ubiquitination compared with MG132.

Mice were injected with indocyanine green (ICG) via tail-vein catheterization. Time-series near-infrared fluorescence signals excited by 760 nm light-emitting diodes were imaged overhead by a charge-coupled device coupled with an 830 nm bandpass-filter. We calculated four CBF parameters including arrival time, rising time and mean transit time of a bolus and blood flow index based on time and intensity information of ICG fluorescence dynamics. CBF maps were generated using the parameters to estimate the status of CBF, and they dominantly represented intracerebral blood flows in mice even in the presence of an intact skull and scalp. We demonstrated that this noninvasive optical imaging technique successfully detected reduced local CBF during middle cerebral artery occlusion. We further showed that the proposed method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the differences between CBF status in mice anesthetized with either isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine, and monitor the dynamic changes in CBF after reperfusion during transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.

METHODS: Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 - 300 g) were arbitrarily assigned to one of two groups - SAH or saline control. Rat subarachnoid hemorrhage in the SAH group (n=15) was induced by double injection of autologous blood, 48 hr apart, into the cisterna magna. Similarly, normal saline (n=13) was injected into the cisterna magna of the saline control group. Rats were sacrificed on day five after the second blood injection and the brains were preserved for histological analysis. The degree of vasospasm was measured using sections of the basilar artery, by measuring the internal luminal cross sectional area using NIH Image-J software. The significance was tested using Tukey/Kramer's statistical analysis. RESULTS: After analysis of histological sections, basilar artery luminal cross sectional area were smaller in the SAH than in the saline group, consistent with cerebral vasospasm in the former group. In the SAH group, basilar artery internal area (.056 mum +/- 3) were significantly smaller from vasospasm five days after the second blood injection (seven days after the initial blood injection), compared to the saline control group with internal area (.069 +/- 3; p=0.004). There were no mortalities from cerebral vasospasm. CONCLUSION: The rat double SAH model induces a mild, survivable, basilar artery vasospasm that can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral vasospasm in a small animal model. A low and acceptable mortality rate is a significant criterion to be satisfied for an ideal SAH animal model so that the mechanisms of vasospasm can be elucidated.

CADASIL is an inherited small vessel disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations including vasculopathy, neurodegeneration and dementia. Here we report two mutations in the zebrafish notch3 gene, one identified in a previous screen for mutations with reduced expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and another caused by a retroviral insertion. Reduced mbp expression in notch3 mutant embryos is associated with fewer oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Despite an early neurogenic phenotype, mbp expression recovered at later developmental stages and some notch3 homozygous mutants survived to adulthood. These mutants, as well as adult zebrafish carrying both mutant alleles together, displayed a striking stress-associated accumulation of blood in the head and fins. Histological analysis of mutant vessels revealed vasculopathy, including: an enlargement (dilation) of vessels in the telencephalon and fin, disorganization of the normal stereotyped arrangement of vessels in the fin, and an apparent loss of arterial morphological structure. Expression of hey1, a well-known transcriptional target of Notch signaling, was greatly reduced in notch3 mutant fins, suggesting that Notch3 acts via a canonical Notch signaling pathway to promote normal vessel structure. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of dilated vessels in notch3 mutant fins and revealed that the vessel walls of presumed arteries showed signs of deterioration. Gaps in the arterial wall and the presence of blood cells outside of vessels in mutants indicated that compromised vessel structure led to hemorrhage. In notch3 heterozygotes, we found elevated expression of both notch3 itself and target genes, indicating that specific alterations in gene expression due to partial loss of Notch3 function might contribute to the abnormalities observed in heterozygous larvae and adults.

These patients harbored a total of 35 aneurysms, which were located on the same side of the ICA occlusion in five cases, on the contralateral side in 20 cases, while in ten cases the aneurysm had a midline location (AcomA 9, Basilar tip 1). Treatment consisted of surgery for eight aneurysms and endovascular embolization for 13 aneurysms. No invasive treatment was recommended for 14 aneurysms (eight patients with single aneurysm). No permanent perioperative or periprocedural complications occurred in the selected group of patients undergoing invasive treatment. At a mean follow-up of 57 months (range, 3-203), no patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and three patients had died of causes not related to the aneurysm. CONCLUSION: Surgical and endovascular treatment can be accomplished safely in selected patients with coexistent ICA occlusion and intracranial aneurysms. Conservative treatment is a valid alternative, especially in elderly patients or in patients with very small aneurysms, especially if not located along the collateral pathway.",2013,Journal Article,Acta Neurochir (Wien),E.

Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) has recently been demonstrated as a candidate plasticity-related gene, making it an excellent candidate molecule that has therapeutic potential. Here, we examine whether in vivo blockage of Gadd45b affects axonal plasticity and subsequent functional recovery after focal brain infarction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We adopted RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by a lentiviral vector (LV) as a means of suppressing the expression of Gadd45b. Functional recovery was assessed with a battery of tests that measured skilled forelimb reaching and forelimb balance controlling. Axonal reorganization at the level of the red nucleus was revealed by anatomical studies. Axonal regeneration was measured by elevated expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43). The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic AMP (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), and Rho-kinase (ROCK) were determined. Gadd45b-RNAi significantly inhibited axonal plasticity (axonal regeneration and axonal reorganization) after MCAO. This inhibition was paralleled by worse functional recovery performance on several behavioral measures. Gadd45b-RNAi also significantly decreased the expression levels of both BDNF and cAMP/PKA/phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) pathway and promoted ROCK expression. We conclude that Gadd45b stimulates recovery after stroke by enhancing axonal plasticity required for brain repair.

Ischemia-induced stimulation of the bumetanide-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of experimental stroke, but the mechanism of its regulation in this context is unknown. Here, we investigated the WNK3-SPAK/OSR1 pathway as a regulator of NKCC1 stimulation and their collective role in ischemic brain damage. METHOD: Wild-type WNK3 and WNK3 knockout mice were subjected to ischemic stroke via transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume, brain edema, blood brain barrier damage, white matter demyelination, and neurological deficits were assessed. Total and phosphorylated forms of WNK3 and SPAK/OSR1 were assayed by immunoblotting and immunostaining. In vitro ischemia studies in cultured neurons and immature oligodendrocytes were conducted using the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation method. RESULTS: WNK3 knockout mice exhibited significantly decreased infarct volume and axonal demyelination, less cerebral edema, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery compared with WNK3 wild-type mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neuroprotective phenotypes conferred by WNK3 knockout were associated with a decrease in stimulatory hyperphosphorylations of the SPAK/OSR1 catalytic T-loop and of NKCC1 stimulatory sites Thr(203)/Thr(207)/Thr(212), as well as with decreased cell surface expression of NKCC1. Genetic inhibition of WNK3 or small interfering RNA knockdown of SPAK/OSR1 increased the tolerance of cultured primary neurons and oligodendrocytes to in vitro ischemia.

The complement cascade, especially the degradation products of complement component 3, is a key inflammatory mediator of cerebral ischemia.

In this study, we investigated whether up-regulation of complement component 3 is directly related to oxidative stress after transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation in brain cells. Persistent up-regulation of complement component 3 expression was reduced in copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase transgenic mice, and manganese-superoxide dismutase knock-out mice showed highly increased complement component 3 levels after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Antioxidant N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone treatment suppressed complement component 3 expression after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Accumulation of complement component 3 in neurons and microglia was decreased by N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone, which reduced infarct volume and impaired neurological deficiency after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in mice.

Antibodies directed predominantly against the alpha(1)-adrenergig receptor were detected in patients suffering from widespread diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Their deleterious action has been demonstrated for peripheral organs. We postulate that antibodies to the alpha(1)-adrenergig receptor are relevant pathomolecules in diseases of the central nervous system associated with vascular impairments. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a rat model we studied the long-term action of antibodies against the alpha(1)-adrenergig receptor either induced by immunization with a receptor peptide or applied by intravenous injection. The vasculature in the rat brains was investigated by time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography using a 9.4 Tesla small animal MR imaging system. Visual examination of maximum-intensity-projections (MIPs) of brain angiographs revealed the development of vascular defects in antibody- exposed animals between three and eight months of treatment. Relative vascular areas were derived from representative MIP image sections by grayscale analysis and used to form an index of vascular circulation. Animals exposed to the action of alpha(1)-adrenergig receptor antibodies showed significantly reduced vascular areas (p<0.05). Calculated index values indicated attenuated blood flow in both antibody-treated cohorts compared to their respective controls reaching with (relative units +/- standard error, n = 10) 0.839 +/- 0.026 versus 0.919 +/- 0.026 statistical significance (p<0.05) for peptide-immunized rats.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was induced for 2 hours with 30 minutes reperfusion in male Wistar rats and compared with ischemia alone (permanent MCAO (pMCAO); 2.5 hours) or sham controls. Changes in lumen diameter of isolated and pressurized PAs were compared. Quantitative PCR was used to measure endothelin type B (ETB) receptors. Constriction to intravascular pressure ('basal tone') was not affected by tMCAO or pMCAO. However, constriction to inhibitors of endothelial cell, small- (SK) and intermediate- (IK) conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels (apamin and TRAM-34, respectively) were significantly enhanced in PAs from tMCAO compared with pMCAO or sham. Addition of the ETB agonist sarafotoxin caused constriction in PAs from tMCAO but not from sham animals (21 +/- 4% versus 3 +/- 3% at 1 nmol/L; P<0.01) that was inhibited by the peroxynitrite scavenger FeTMPyP (5,10,15,20-tetrakis (N-methyl-4'-pyridyl) porphinato iron (III) chloride) (100 mumol/L). Expression of ETB receptors was not found on PA smooth muscle, suggesting that constriction to sarafotoxin after tMCAO was due to peroxynitrite and not ETB receptor expression.

With reperfusion, blood flow is partially restored. We examined the effects of ischemia-reperfusion on the heterogeneity of local venous oxygen saturation in rats in order to determine the pattern of microregional O2 supply/consumption balance in reperfusion. METHODS: The middle cerebral artery was blocked for 1 hour using the internal carotid approach in 1 group (n=9) and was then reperfused for 2 hours in another group (n=9) of isoflurane-anesthetized rats. Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C(14)-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small vessel arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. RESULTS: After 1 hour of ischemia, local cerebral blood flow (92+/-10 versus 50+/-10 mL/min per 100 g) and O2 consumption (4.5+/-0.6 versus 2.7+/-0.5 mL O2/min per 100 g) decreased compared with the contralateral cortex. Oxygen extraction increased (4.7+/-0.2 versus 5.4+/-0.3 mL O2/100 mL) and the variation in small vein (20-60 mum) O2 saturation as determined by its coefficient of variation (=100xSD/mean) increased (5.5 versus 10.5). With 2 hours of reperfusion, the blood flow decrement was reduced and O2 consumption returned to the value in the contralateral cortex. Oxygen extraction remained elevated in the ischemic-reperfused area and the coefficient of variation of small vein O2 saturation increased further (17.3). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated continued reduction of O2 supply/consumption balance with reperfusion.

In humans, cerebral infarcts are typically smaller in premenopausal females than in age-matched males. In the current study, we confirmed smaller infarcts in female vs. male mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 96 h of reperfusion. Moreover, we explored immunological alterations related to this difference and found that the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in spleens in males than females, with increased expression of the activation markers, CD69 and CD44. In contrast, the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly higher in spleens of females than males, leading to the identification of a small but distinct population of IL-10-secreting CD8+CD122+ suppressor T cells that were also increased in females. Finally, we observed that males have a greater percentage of activated macrophages/microglia in the brain than females, as well as increased expression of the VLA-4 adhesion molecule in both brain and spleen.

Once considered inert scaffolds, basement membranes are now viewed as dynamic and versatile environments that modulate cellular behaviors to regulate tissue development, function, and repair. Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to providing structural support to neighboring cells, basement membranes serve as reservoirs of growth factors that direct and fine-tune cellular functions. Type IV collagens are a major component of all basement membranes. They evolved along with the earliest multicellular organisms and have been integrated into diverse fundamental biological processes as time and evolution shaped the animal kingdom. The roles of basement membranes in humans are as complex and diverse as their distributions and molecular composition. As a result, basement membrane defects result in multisystem disorders with ambiguous and overlapping boundaries that likely reflect the simultaneous interplay and integration of multiple cellular pathways and processes. Consequently, there will be no single treatment for basement membrane disorders, and therapies are likely to be as varied as the phenotypes.

Two hours middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) or sham surgery was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits were measured over 10 weeks included: (1) sensory, motor, beam balance, reflex/abnormal responses, hindlimb placement, forepaw foot fault and cylinder placement tests, and (2) complex active place avoidance learning (APA) and simple passive avoidance retention (PA). Electroretinogram (ERG), hemispheric loss (infarction), hippocampus CA1 neuronal loss and myelin (Luxol Fast Blue) staining in several fiber tracts were also measured. In comparison to Sham surgery, tMCAO surgery produced significant deficits in all behavioral tests except reflex/abnormal responses. Acute, short lived deficits following tMCAO were observed for forelimb foot fault and forelimb cylinder placement. Persistent, sustained deficits for the whole 10 weeks were exhibited for motor (p<0.001), sensory (p<0.001), beam balance performance (p<0.01) and hindlimb placement behavior (p<0.01). tMCAO produced much greater and prolonged cognitive deficits in APA learning (maximum on last trial of 604+/-83% change, p<0.05) but only a small, comparative effect on PA retention.

METHODS: Thirty-seven C57Bl/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the length of coating over the tip of the suture (1, 2, 3, or 4 mm) and subjected to transient MCAO for 2 hours. Real-time topographical cerebral blood flow was monitored over both hemispheres by laser speckle flowmetry. After 24 hours of reperfusion, the infarct territories and volumes were evaluated.

In the 3- and 4-mm coating groups, 62.5% and 75% of mice, respectively, showed lesions in both the MCA and the PCA territories and other lesions in the MCA territory. Mice in the 1- and 2-mm coating groups had significantly smaller infarct volumes than the 3- and 4-mm groups. Laser speckle flowmetry was useful to distinguish whether the PCA territory would undergo infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Small changes in the coating length of the intraluminal suture may be critical, and 1-2 mm of coating appeared to be optimal to produce consistent MCAO without involving the PCA territory.

Mice harbouring mutations in either Col4a1 or Col4a2 suffer from porencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral and ocular bleeding and developmental defects. We observed porencephaly and white matter lesions in members from two families that lack COL4A1 mutations. We hypothesized that COL4A2 mutations confer genetic predisposition to porencephaly, therefore we sequenced COL4A2 in the family members and characterized clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical phenotypes. Genomic sequencing of COL4A2 identified the heterozygous missense G1389R in exon 44 in one family and the c.3206delC change in exon 34 leading to frame shift and premature stop, in the second family. Fragmentation and duplication of epidermal basement membranes were observed by electron microscopy in a c.3206delC patient skin biopsy, consistent with abnormal collagen IV network. Collagen chain accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been proposed as cellular mechanism in COL4A1 mutations. In COL4A2 (3206delC) fibroblasts we detected increased rates of apoptosis and no signs of ER stress. Mutation phenotypes varied, including porencephaly, white matter lesions, cerebellar and optic nerve hypoplasia and unruptured carotid aneurysm.

CeVD is a complex and multifactorial disease caused by the interaction of vascular risk factors, environment, and genetic factors. In the present article, we discussed genetic susceptibility to CeVD, with particular emphasis on genetic studies of the associations between lipid traits and CeVD. RECENT FINDINGS: Several animal and clinical studies clearly defined genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis and CeVD, and particularly to ischemic stroke. Recent evidence has shown that traditional vascular risk factors explain only a small proportion of variance in atherosclerosis, suggesting that additional nontraditional factors and novel genetic determinants impact CeVD. With the help of genome-wide technology, novel genetic variants have been implicated in CeVD and lipid metabolism such as those in protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene in stroke and familial hypercholesterolemia. These studies are important as they contribute to our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying CeVD and to developing more effective CeVD prevention strategies. SUMMARY: CeVD is a complex and multifactorial disease and genetics likely plays an important role in its pathogenesis. The gene-gene and gene-environment interactions of genes involved in biology of vascular disease, including the lipid metabolism are important factors for individual susceptibility to CeVD.

Mitochondrial dynamics has attracted increasing attention as to its relationship with mitochondria autophagy, also known as mitophagy, which is critical for degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Mitochondrial fi ssion and its role in clearance of injured mitochondria in acute ischemic injury, however, have not been elucidated yet. Here we showed that hypoxic/ischemic conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and induction of mitophagy in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) PC12 cells. Inhibition of Drp1 by pharmacologic inhibitor or siRNA resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria mainly through selectively blocking mitophagy without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and non-selective autophagy. Drp1 inhibitors increased the infarct volume and aggravated the neurological de fi cits in a rat model of pMCAO. We demonstrated that the devastating role of disturbed mitochondrial fission by inhibiting Drp1 contributed to the damaged mitochondria-mediated injury such as ROS generation, cyt-c release and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, we proved that under hypoxic/ischemic stress a Drp1-dependent mitophagy was triggered which was involved in the removal of damaged mitochondria and cellular survival at the early stage of hypoxic/ischemic injury. Thus, Drp1 related pathway involved in selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is proposed as an efficient target for treatment of cerebral ischemia.",2014,Journal Article,Neuropharmacology,W.

In neurodegenerative diseases, pathologically activated astrocytes show astrogliosis, which is clinically characterized by an abnormal cell morphology and excessive astrocyte proliferation. Thrombin, a crucial factor for brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage, activates astrocytic Ca2+ signaling through a specific subtype of the thrombin receptor, termed the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR). In this study, we demonstrate a novel pathophysiological role for transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels in thrombin-activated astrocytes. In 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells and cultured rat cortical astrocytes, thrombin induced heterogeneous Ca2+ responses with asynchronous repetitive peaks. These oscillations were found to be the result of repetitive Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by replenishment of the stores with Ca2+ from the extracellular region. The oscillations occurred without a direct [Ca2+]i increase and were inhibited by the selective TRPC3 inhibitor pyrazole-3. Pharmacological manipulation with BAPTA-AM, cyclopiazonic acid, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and pyrazole-3 indicated that Ca2+ mobilization through TRPC3 was involved in thrombin-induced changes in the morphology of astrocytes. Moreover, thrombin-induced upregulation of S100B, a marker of reactive astrocytes, at 20 h and increased astrocytic proliferation at 72 h were inhibited by Ca2+ signaling blockers and knockdown of TRPC3 with specific siRNA.

The two protein expression in cerebral vessels changed dynamically, peaking at 1-2 weeks after treatment, and decreasing as treatment continued. These results suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may play a significant role in blood-brain barrier disruption after alcohol abuse.

Lipids, on the other hand, are the most abundant molecules in the brain and readily cross the blood-brain barrier. We previously showed that certain sphingolipid (SL) species are highly specific to the brain. Here we examined the feasibility of using SLs as biomarkers for acute brain injury. A rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a mouse model of stroke were used to identify candidate SL species though our mass-spectrometry based lipid profiling approach. Plasma samples collected after TBI in the rat showed large increases in many circulating SLs following injury, and larger lesions produced proportionately larger increases. Plasma samples collected 24 hours after stroke in mice similarly revealed a large increase in many SLs. We constructed an SL score (sum of the two SL species showing the largest relative increases in the mouse stroke model) and then evaluated the diagnostic value of this score on a small sample of patients (n = 14) who presented with acute stroke symptoms. Patients with true stroke had significantly higher SL scores than patients found to have non-stroke causes of their symptoms. The SL score correlated with the volume of ischemic brain tissue. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using lipid biomarkers to diagnose brain injury. Future studies will be needed to further characterize the diagnostic utility of this approach and to transition to an assay method applicable to clinical settings.",2015,Journal Article,PLoS One,S.

Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC), containing various stem and progenitor cells, have been used to treat various brain genetic conditions. In small animal experiments, HUCBC have improved outcomes after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. Clinical trials using HUCBC are underway, testing feasibility, safety and efficacy for neonatal injury as well as CP. We tested HUCBC therapy in a validated rabbit model of CP after acute changes secondary to HI injury had subsided. Following uterine ischemia at 70% gestation, we infused HUCBC into newborn rabbit kits with either mild or severe neurobehavioral changes. Infusion of high-dose HUCBC (5 x 10(6) cells) dramatically altered the natural history of the injury, alleviating the abnormal phenotype including posture, righting reflex, locomotion, tone, and dystonia. Half the high dose showed lesser but still significant improvement. The swimming test, however, showed that joint function did not restore to naive control function in either group. Tracing HUCBC with either MRI biomarkers or PCR for human DNA found little penetration of HUCBC in the newborn brain in the immediate newborn period, suggesting that the beneficial effects were not due to cellular integration or direct proliferative effects but rather to paracrine signaling.

To correlate them with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients presenting NPSLE undergoing brain MRI within 6 months after onset between 2003 and 2012. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. MRI findings were defined as inflammatory-like, large-vessel disease (LVD), and small-vessel disease (SVD); SVD was classified as white-matter hyperintensities (WMH), recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. RESULTS: We included 108 patients (mean 40.6 +/- 14.2 years; range 14-77), 91.7% women. The most frequent syndromes were headache (28.5%), cerebrovascular disease (15.5%), seizure (15.5%), and cognitive dysfunction (11.4%). Brain abnormalities were found in 59.3%. SVD was the most common (55.6%), followed by LVD (13%) and inflammatory-like lesions (6.5%). The most frequent SVD findings were WMH (53.7%), atrophy (18.5%), microbleeds (13.7%) and lacunes (11.1%). Cerebrovascular syndrome correlated with LVD (p = 0.001) and microbleeds (p = 0.002), cognitive dysfunction with WMH (p = 0.045) and myelopathy with inflammatory-like lesions (p = 0.020).

It is also becoming increasingly evident that miRNAs are involved in the etiology of several neurological disorders. Mounting evidence indicates that miRNAs have the ability to regulate the expression profiles of genes in signaling pathways associated with cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and vascular dementia. For instance, miR-21 is involved in ischemic stroke pathology through atherosclerosis and provides neuroprotection by its anti-apoptotic features. miR-497 induces neuronal death and miR-210 is upregulated in hypoxic cells. Deregulated expression of miRNAs in response to ischemic stroke has enabled the use of miRNA as an efficient non-invasive biomarker. Antagomirs are often effective against neuronal apoptosis and can induce neuroregeneration following ischemia. Moreover, the advent of systems biology has introduced novel computational tools to identify the link between miRNAs, target genes and transcription factors involved in the stroke pathology and its treatment.

We report here that BTA-EG4 decreases Abeta levels, alters cell surface expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and improves memory in wild-type mice. Interestingly, the BTA-EG4-mediated behavioral improvement is not correlated with LTP, but with increased spinogenesis. The higher dendritic spine density reflects an increase in the number of functional synapses as determined by increased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency without changes in presynaptic parameters or postsynaptic mEPSC amplitude. Additionally, BTA-EG4 requires APP to regulate dendritic spine density through a Ras signaling-dependent mechanism.

We hypothesized that monkeys with stronger hand preference would exhibit poorer recovery of skilled hand use after such brain injury. Degree of handedness was assessed using a standard dexterity board task in which subjects could use either hand to retrieve small food pellets. Fine hand/digit motor function was assessed using a modified dexterity board before and after the M1 and LPMC lesions in ten monkeys. We found a strong negative relationship between the degree of handedness and the recovery of manipulation skill, demonstrating that higher hand preference was associated with poorer recovery of hand fine motor function. We also observed that monkeys with larger lesions within M1 and LPMC had greater initial impairment of manipulation and poorer recovery of reaching skill. We conclude that monkeys with a stronger hand preference are likely to show poorer recovery of contralesional hand fine motor skill after isolated brain lesions affecting the lateral frontal motor areas. These data may be extended to suggest that humans who exhibit weak hand dominance, and perhaps individuals who use both hands for fine motor tasks, may have a more favorable potential for recovery after a unilateral stroke or brain injury affecting the lateral cortical motor areas than individuals with a high degree of hand dominance.",2013,Journal Article,Exp Brain Res,W.

Despite emerging evidence of a substantial impact on physical disability and dementia, little attention has been paid to the development of specific treatments. The optimal use of the animal models of lacunar stroke used to test candidate interventions is not known. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies testing candidate interventions in animal models of lacunar stroke. We used random-effects meta-analysis to assess the impact of study characteristics and trim and fill to seek evidence of publication bias. RESULTS: The efficacy of 43 distinct interventions was described in 57 publications. The median number of quality checklist items scored was 3 of 8 (interquartile range, 2-4). Many models reflected mechanisms of limited relevance to lacunar stroke. Meta-analysis of results from 27 studies showed that on average, infarct size and neurobehavioral outcome were improved by 34.2% (24.1-44.2) and 0.82 standardized mean difference (0.51-1.14), respectively. Four interventions improved both infarct size and neurobehavioral outcome but there were insufficient data for this finding to be considered robust. For infarct size, efficacy was lower in studies reporting blinding and higher in studies reporting randomization. For neurobehavior, efficacy was lower in randomized studies. For infarct size there was evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: No intervention has yet been tested in sufficient range and depth to support translation to clinical trial.

However, little is known about the severe pathological condition and dementia that occur as a result of the comorbid occurrence of this vascular risk factor and Abeta toxicity. Clinical studies have indicated that small ischemic lesions in the striatum are particularly important in generating dementia in combination with minor amyloid lesions. These cognitive deficits are highly likely to be caused by changes in the cortex. In this study, we examined the viability and morphological changes in microglial and neuronal cells, gap junction proteins (connexin43) and neuritic/axonal retraction (Fer Kinase) in the striatum and cerebral cortex using a comorbid rat model of striatal injections of endothelin-1 (ET1) and Abeta toxicity. The results demonstrated ventricular enlargement, striatal atrophy, substantial increases in beta-amyloid, ramified microglia and increases in neuritic retraction in the combined models of stroke and Abeta toxicity. Changes in connexin43 occurred equally in both groups of Abeta-treated rats, with and without focal ischemia.

Cell death following cerebral ischemia is mediated by a complex pathophysiological interaction of various mechanisms. During an ischemic insult, not only neurons but all of the components of the neurovascular unit, such as glia, endothelia, pericytes and basal membranes, are destroyed. Previous studies have shown that excessive stimulation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is crucial for cerebral injury after ischemic insult, which is an important cause of cell death in all cell types within the neurovascular unit. To investigate whether PARP-1 plays an important role in protecting the neurovascular unit following cerebral ischemia, we evaluated neurobehavioral deficits, PARP-1 activity, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neurovascular unit deficits using Western blot analysis, TTC staining and electron microscopy in an MCAO rat model. The results revealed that PARP-1 enzymatic activity was dramatically increased after ischemia. Inhibition of PARP-1 significantly reduced the extent of both cerebral infarction and edema, improved neurological scores, and attenuated the damage to the neurovascular unit in cerebral ischemia.

However, the contribution of each SGLT isoform in cerebral ischemia is still unclear. SGLT-1, -3, -4, and -6 have been reported to be expressed in various brain regions. Among these isoforms, only SGLT-3 does not transport glucose, but depolarizes the plasma membrane when glucose is bound, suggesting that SGLT-3 is a glucose sensor. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the involvement of cerebral SGLT-3 in the development of ischemia. The mouse model of focal ischemia was generated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was assessed by histological and behavioral analyses. Fasting blood glucose levels on day 1 after MCAO were not affected in SGLT-3 siRNA-mediated knockdown of SGLT-3.

Anti-SDF-1 blocking antibody was given to mice and compared with control (vehicle)-administered mice for its effects on the walls of carotid aneurysms and the development of intracranial aneurysms. RESULTS: Human aneurysms, murine carotid aneurysms, and murine intracranial aneurysms all expressed SDF-1, and mice with developing carotid or intracranial aneurysms had increased progenitor cells expressing CXCR4, the receptor for SDF-1 (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Human aneurysms and murine carotid aneurysms had endothelial cells, macrophages, and capillaries in the walls of the aneurysms, and the presence of capillaries in the walls of human aneurysms was associated with the presence of macrophages (p = 0.01). Stromal cell-derived factor-1 promoted endothelial cell and macrophage migration (p < 0.01 for each), and promoted capillary tube formation (p < 0.001). When mice were given anti-SDF-1 blocking antibody, there was a significant reduction in endothelial cells (p < 0.05), capillaries (p < 0.05), and cell proliferation (p < 0.05) in the aneurysm wall. Mice given anti-SDF-1 blocking antibody developed significantly fewer intracranial aneurysms (33% vs 89% in mice given control immunoglobulin G, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest SDF-1 is associated with angiogenesis and inflammatory cell migration and proliferation in the walls of aneurysms, and may have a role in the development of intracranial aneurysms.",2014,Journal Article,J Neurosurg,B.

Here we used a rat model of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to examine whether matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a zinc endopeptidase that regulates growth factor levels during recovery from brain injury, is involved in neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH.

Actovegin is an ultrafiltrate of calf blood, composed of more than 200 biological substances. The drug is used for a broad spectrum of diseases, including disturbances of peripheral and cerebral blood circulation, burns, impaired wound healing, radiation-induced damage and diabetic polyneuropathy. Actovegin is composed of small molecules present under normal physiological conditions, therefore pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to determine its active substance are not feasible. Preclinical data have revealed that it improves metabolic balance by increasing glucose uptake and improving oxygen uptake under conditions of ischemia. Actovegin also resists the effects of gamma-irradiation and stimulates wound healing. More recent preclinical studies have suggested that anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic mechanisms of action specifically underlie the neuroprotective properties of Actovegin. The drug has been found to exert these beneficial effects experimentally, in primary rat hippocampal neurons and in an STZ-rat model of diabetic polyneuropathy, while also providing evidence that it positively affects the functional recovery of neurons. Latest data suggest that Actovegin also has a positive influence on the NF-kappaB pathway, but many molecular and cellular pathways remain unexplored. In particular, Actovegin's influence on neuroplasticity, neurogenesis and neurotrophicity are questions that ideally should be answered by future research. Nevertheless, it is clear that the multifactorial and complex nature of Actovegin underlies its pleiotropic neuroprotective mechanisms of action and positive effect on clinical outcomes.",2012,Journal Article,J Neurol Sci,F.

Currently, treatment of ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolytic therapy with a narrow time window of administration. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway has a fundamental role in the central nervous system development, but its impact on neural cell survival and tissue regeneration/repair after ischemic stroke has not been well investigated. Here we report the neuroprotective properties of a small-molecule agonist of the Shh co-receptor Smoothened, purmorphamine (PUR), in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke. We found that intravenous administration of PUR at 6 h after injury was neuroprotective and restored neurological deficit after stroke. PUR promoted a transient upregulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator in injured neurons, which was associated with a reduction of apoptotic cell death in the ischemic cortex. We also observed a decrease in blood-brain barrier permeability after PUR treatment. At 14 d postinjury, attenuation of inflammation and reactive astrogliosis was found in PUR-treated animals. PUR increased the number of newly generated neurons in the peri-infarct and infarct area and promoted neovascularization in the ischemic zone. Notably, PUR treatment did not significantly alter the ischemia-induced level of Gli1, a Shh target gene of tumorigenic potential. Thus our study reports a novel pharmacological approach for postischemic treatment using a small-molecule Shh agonist, providing new insights into hedgehog signaling-mediated mechanisms of neuroprotection and regeneration after stroke.",2014,Journal Article,Cell Death Dis,O.

However, the upstream mediator(s) that triggers the process has not been identified. Previously, we showed that the expression of CD36, an inflammatory mediator, occurs in a subset of astcotyes in the peri-infarct area where the glial scar forms. This study investigates a role for CD36 in astrocyte activation and glial scar formation in stroke. We observed that the expression of CD36 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) coincided in control and injured astrocytes and in the brain. Furthermore, GFAP expression was attenuated in CD36 small interfering RNA transfected astrocytes or in the brain of CD36 knockout (KO) mice, suggesting its involvement in GFAP expression. Using an in-vitro model of wound healing, we found that CD36 deficiency attenuated the proliferation of astrocytes and delayed closure of the wound gap. Furthermore, stroke-induced GFAP expression and scar formation were significantly attenuated in the CD36 KO mice compared with wild type. These findings identify CD36 as a novel mediator for injury-induced astrogliosis and scar formation.

This so-called periventricular venous collagenosis is an expected mechanical consequence of the age-related changes in arterial pulsations and the mechanical fatigue of vascular smooth muscles. Unlike arteriolar mechanical stress, venular mechanical stress depends on both the blood pulse wave amplitude and the mechanical properties of the environment tissue. Thereby, there is a preferential periventricular location of venous collagenosis and a mechanistic link between venous collagenosis and foci of white matter rarefaction or leukoaraiosis. The recent concept of pulse wave encephalopathy also helps understanding the widening of retinal venules, the ""mirror"" of cerebral venules, in various manifestations of pulse wave encephalopathy, including progressive leukoaraosis, lacunar and hemorrhagic ""pulse wave"" strokes, and dementia. Indeed, the age-related chronic increase in arterial pulsations explains subsequent arteriolar myogenic ""fatigue"", marked attenuation in the arteriolar myogenic tone and abnormal penetration of the insufficiently dampened arterial pulse wave into the venules. Thus, retinal venular widening, a biomarker of advanced pulse wave encephalopathy, is also increasingly recognized as a biomarker for high cardiovascular risk. All these data support a shift in the concept of chronic cerebrovascular disease, from the classical model which is restricted to steno-occlusive cerebrovascular diseases to an enlarged model which would include the pulse wave encephalopathy concept. Thereby, preventing damage to the cerebral microvasculature by an undampened arterial pulse wave will become a logical target for the prevention and treatment of late-onset cognitive decline.",2012,Journal Article,Curr Aging Sci,M.

Memory symptoms in CADASIL, the most common hereditary form of vascular dementia, are usually thought to be primarily due to vascular degeneration and white matter lacunes. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process essential for the integration of new spatial memory occurs in a highly vascularized niche, we considered dysregulation of adult neurogenesis as a potential mechanism for the manifestation of dementia in CADASIL. Analysis in aged mice overexpressing Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation, revealed vascular deficits in arteries of the hippocampal fissure but not in the niche of the dentate gyrus. At 12 months of age, cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons were reduced not only in CADASIL mice but also in transgenic controls overexpressing wild type Notch3. At 6 months, hippocampal neurogenesis was altered in CADASIL mice independent of overt vascular abnormalities in the fissure. Further, we identified Notch3 expression in hippocampal precursor cells and maturing neurons in vivo as well as in cultured hippocampal precursor cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that Notch3 signaling negatively regulated precursor cell proliferation. Notch3 overexpression also led to deficits in KCl-induced precursor cell activation. This suggests a cell-autonomous effect of Notch3 signaling in the regulation of precursor proliferation and activation and a loss-of-function effect in CADASIL. Consequently, besides vascular damage, aberrant precursor cell proliferation and differentiation due to Notch3 dysfunction might be an additional independent mechanism for the development of hippocampal dysfunction in CADASIL.",2015,Journal Article,Neurobiol Dis,F.

Delivery of drugs to the CNS is complicated by the blood-brain barriers that protect the brain from the unregulated leakage and entry of substances, including proteins, from the blood. Yet proteins represent one of the most promising classes of therapeutics for the treatment of CNS diseases. Many strategies for overcoming these obstacles are in development, but the relatively straightforward approach of bypassing these barriers through direct intrathecal administration has been largely overlooked. Originally discounted because of its lack of usefulness for delivering small, lipid-soluble drugs to the brain, the intrathecal route has emerged as a useful, in some cases perhaps the ideal, route of administration for certain therapeutic protein and targeted disease combinations. Here, we review blood-brain barrier functions and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and their relevance to drug delivery via the intrathecal route, discuss animal and human studies that have investigated intrathecal delivery of protein therapeutics, and outline several characteristics of protein therapeutics that can allow them to be successfully delivered intrathecally.",2014,Journal Article,Pharmacol Ther,P.

These results indicate that MVECs have a survival effect on OPCs, and this effect might contribute to the recovery of the white matter infarct. The conditioned-medium from cultured MVECs reduced apoptosis of cultured OPCs, while the conditioned medium from cultured fibroblasts did not show such effect.

Here, we first provide a platform for further studies by showing that middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male C57BL/6 mice robustly enhances neurogenesis in the SVZ only under very specific conditions, i.e., 14days after a 30min occlusion. CNTF expression paralleled changes in the number of proliferated, BrdU-positive, SVZ cells. Stroke-induced proliferation was absent in CNTF-/- mice, suggesting that it is mediated by CNTF. MCAO-increased CNTF appears to act on C cell proliferation and by inducing FGF2 expression but not via EGF expression or Notch1 signaling of neural stem cells in the SVZ. CNTF is unique, as expression of other gp130 ligands, IL-6 and LIF, did not predict SVZ proliferation or showed no or only small compensatory increases in CNTF-/- mice. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which can inhibit neurogenesis, and the presence of leukocytes in the SVZ were inversely correlated with neurogenesis, but pro-inflammatory cytokines did not affect CNTF expression in cultured astrocytes. These results suggest that slowly up-regulated CNTF in the SVZ mediates stroke-induced neurogenesis and is counteracted by inflammation. Further pharmacological stimulation of endogenous CNTF might be a good therapeutic strategy for cell replacement after stroke as CNTF regulates normal patterns of neurogenesis and is expressed almost exclusively in the nervous system.",2013,Journal Article,Neurobiol Dis,S.

METHODS: SAH was induced in rabbits and a control group was sham operated. There were 32 rabbits in each group that survived the second operation, and they were randomly assigned to four groups of eight rabbits each for follow-up assessments on Days 1, 4, 7, or 14, respectively.

RESULTS: In the control group, there was no difference in CBV, CBF, and MTT in the six ROIs, and plasma NO was unchanged.

Therapeutic options are very limited. We assessed the effects of D-JNKi, a small peptide c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase inhibitor, on neuroinflammation, mitochondrial integrity and neuronal damage in a neonatal rat model of ischemic brain damage. Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced in postnatal-day 7 rats by unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia, and was followed by intraperitoneal D-JNKi treatment. We demonstrate here for the first time that a single intraperitoneal injection with D-JNKi directly after HI strongly reduces neonatal brain damage by >85% with a therapeutic window of at least 6h. D-JNKi treatment also restored cognitive and motor function as analyzed at 9weeks post-insult. Neuroprotective D-JNKi treatment inhibited phosphorylation of nuclear c-Jun (P-c-Jun), and consequently reduced activity of the AP-1 transcription factor and production of cerebral cytokines/chemokines as determined at 3 and 24h post-HI. Inhibition of P-c-Jun by D-JNKi is thought to be mediated via inhibition of the upstream phosphorylation of cytosolic and nuclear JNK and/or by preventing the direct interaction of phosphorylated (P-)JNK with c-Jun. Surprisingly, however, HI did not induce a detectable increase in P-JNK in cytosol or nucleus. Notably, we show here for the first time that HI induces P-JNK only in the mitochondrial fraction, which was completely prevented by D-JNKi treatment. The hypothesis that mitochondrial JNK activation is key to HI brain injury was supported by data showing that treatment of rat pups with SabKIM1 peptide, a specific mitochondrial JNK inhibitor, is also neuroprotective. Inhibition of HI-induced mitochondrial JNK activation was associated with preservation of mitochondrial integrity as evidenced by prevention of ATP loss and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The HI-induced increase in apoptotic markers (cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation) as analyzed at 24h post-HI were also strongly reduced by D-JNKi and the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were upregulated. Neuroprotection was lost after repeated 0+3h D-JNKi treatment which was associated with complete inhibition of the second peak of AP-1 activity and disability to upregulate mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. We show here for the first time that D-JNKi treatment efficiently protects the neonatal brain against ischemic brain damage and subsequent cognitive and motor impairment. We propose that inhibition of phosphorylation of mitochondrial JNK is a pivotal step in preventing early loss of mitochondrial integrity leading to reduced neuroinflammation and inhibition of apoptotic neuronal loss.

For acute ischemic stroke, fibrinolysis is the only treatment option with a very narrow therapeutic window. Clinically approved thrombolytics have significant drawbacks, including bleeding complications. Thus their use is highly restricted, leaving many patients untreated. OBJECTIVE: We developed a novel targeted fibrinolytic drug that is directed against activated platelets. METHODS AND RESULTS: We fused single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scuPA) to a small recombinant antibody (scFvSCE5), which targets the activated form of the platelet-integrin glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Antibody binding and scuPA activity of this recombinant fusion protein were on par with the parent molecules. Prophylactic in vivo administration of scFvSCE5-scuPA (75 U/g body weight) prevented carotid artery occlusion after ferric chloride injury in a plasminogen-dependent process compared with saline (P<0.001), and blood flow recovery was similar to high-dose nontargeted urokinase (500 U/g body weight). Tail bleeding time was significantly prolonged with this high dose of nontargeted urokinase, but not with equally effective targeted scFvSCE5-scuPA at 75 U/g body weight. Real-time in vivo molecular ultrasound imaging demonstrates significant therapeutic reduction of thrombus size after administration of 75 U/g body weight scFvSCE5-scuPA as compared with the same dose of a mutated, nontargeting scFv-scuPA or vehicle. The ability of scFvSCE5-scuPA to lyse thrombi was lost in plasminogen-deficient mice, but could be restored by intravenous injection of plasminogen. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting of scuPA to activated glycoprotein IIb/IIIa allows effective thrombolysis and the potential novel use as a fibrinolytic agent for thromboprophylaxis without bleeding complications.",2014,Journal Article,Circ Res,X.

Improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches strongly rely on adequate gyrencephalic, large animal models being demanded for translational research. Ovine stroke models may represent a promising approach but are currently limited by insufficient knowledge regarding the venous system of the cerebral angioarchitecture. The present study was intended to provide a comprehensive anatomical analysis of the intracranial venous system in sheep as a reliable basis for the interpretation of experimental results in such ovine models. We used corrosion casts as well as contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography to scrutinize blood drainage from the brain. This combined approach yielded detailed and, to some extent, novel findings. In particular, we provide evidence for chordae Willisii and lateral venous lacunae, and report on connections between the dorsal and ventral sinuses in this species. For the first time, we also describe venous confluences in the deep cerebral venous system and an 'anterior condylar confluent' as seen in humans. This report provides a detailed reference for the interpretation of venous diagnostic imaging findings in sheep, including an assessment of structure detectability by in vivo (imaging) versus ex vivo (corrosion cast) visualization methods.

The changes in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism associated with stroke play an important role in pathophysiology study. But the changes were difficult to describe with a single imaging modality. Here the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and oxygen saturation (SO2) were yielded with laser speckle imaging (LSI) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) during and after 3-h acute focal ischemic rats. These hemodynamic measures were further synthesized to deduce the changes in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). The results indicate that all the hemodynamics except CBV had rapid declines within 40-min occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO). CBV in arteries and veins first increased to the maximum value of 112.42 +/- 36.69% and 130.58 +/- 31.01% by 15 min MCAO; then all the hemodynamics had a persistent reduction with small fluctuations during the ischemic. When ischemia lasted for 3 h, CBF in arteries, veins decreased to 17 +/- 14.65%, 24.52 +/- 20.66%, respectively, CBV dropped to 62 +/- 18.56% and 59 +/- 18.48%.

Magnetic resonance imaging methods may be capable of detecting a number of the pathoanatomical and pathophysiological consequences of focal and diffuse traumatic brain injury. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) detects heme iron and reveals even small venous microhemorrhages occurring in diffuse vascular injury. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals axonal injury by detecting alterations in water flow in and around injured axons. The overarching hypothesis of this paper is that newer, advanced MR imaging generates sensitive biomarkers of regional brain injury which allows for correlation with clinical signs and symptoms. METHODS: Studies involving subjects with a history of traumatic brain injury as well as healthy, non-trauma controls were used. Analysis involved comparison of TBI patients' imaging results with healthy controls as well as correlation of imaging findings with clinical measures of injury severity. An additional animal study of Sprague-Dawley albino rats compared imaging results with histopathological findings after the animals were sacrificed and stained for b-APP. RESULTS: SWI revealed small foci of hemosiderin for some patients while aggregate lesion volume on SWI correlated with clinical injury severity indices. Similarly, DTI showed striking group differences for fractional anisotropy over the white matter globally, while tract and voxel-based regional results colocalized with SWI and FLAIR lesions in some cases and correlated with clinical deficits. For the rats, correlations were seen between imaging findings and staining of axonal injury. DISCUSSION: Animal data gave important tissue correlations with imaging results. SWI and DTI are commercially available sequences that can improve the diagnostic and prognostic ability of the trauma clinician. These biomarkers of regional brain injury which are present in imaging shortly after acute injury and persist indefinitely can inform clinicians and researchers about not only injury severity but also which neurobehavioral systems were injured. Analogous to stroke rehabilitation, having an understanding of the distribution of brain injury should ultimately allow for development of more effective rehabilitation strategies and more efficient clinical interventional trials.",2012,Journal Article,NeuroRehabilitation,R.

IN THE FIRST 14 DAYS: Natural history studies suggest that 8-15% of patients with 50-99% stenoses will suffer a stroke within 72 hours of their index symptom. Currently, there are insufficient validated data to identify highest-risk patients for emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEA), but an increased risk of stroke appears to be predicted by (i) an ABCD(2) score of 4-7; (ii) the presence of acute cerebral injury on CT/MRI; (iii) Gray Scale Median (GSM) <15, (iv) spontaneous embolisation on Transcranial Doppler (TCD); and (v) increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the carotid plaque on positron emission tomography (PET). A future goal must be to develop predictive algorithms (based on accessible imaging strategies) for identifying acutely symptomatic patients with highly unstable plaques for emergency CEA. MEDIUM TO LONG TERM: In the randomised trials, about 70% of patients with symptomatic 70-99% stenoses were stroke-free on ""best medical therapy"" at 5 years. Clinical predictors of increased stroke risk include (i) male gender; (ii) age >75; (iii) hemispheric symptoms; and (iv) increasing comorbidity. Imaging features associated with increased stroke risk include (i) irregular stenoses; (ii) contralateral occlusion; (iii) increasing stenosis severity, but not subocclusion; (iv) tandem intracranial disease; (v) a failure to recruit intracranial collaterals; (vi) low GSM; (vii) MR diagnosis of intra-plaque haemorrhage; (vii) spontaneous embolisation on TCD; and (viii) increased FDG uptake in the carotid plaque on PET. Clinical/imaging parameters associated with a lower risk of stroke include (i) female gender, especially those with 50-99% stenoses; (ii) ocular symptoms/lacunar stroke; (iii) smooth stenoses; and (iv) chronic subocclusion.",2015,Journal Article,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,A.

This has been attributed, albeit controversially, to the infiltration of iron-laden blood-borne macrophages. The properties of nanoparticles that render them most suitable for phagocytosis is a matter of debate, as is the most relevant timepoint for administration. Both of these questions are examined in the present study. Imaging experiments were performed in mice with 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Iron oxide nanoparticles with different charges and sizes were used, and mice received 300 mumol Fe/kg intravenously: either superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs), ultrasmall SPIOs, or very small SPIOs. The particles were administered 7 days before MCAO, at the time of reperfusion, or 72 hours after MCAO. Interestingly, there was no observable signal change in the ischemic brains that could be attributed to iron. Furthermore, no Prussian blue-positive cells were found in the brains or blood leukocytes, despite intense staining in the livers and spleens. This implies that the nanoparticles selected for this study are not phagocytosed by blood-borne leukocytes and do not enter the ischemic mouse brain.",2013,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,C.

Reorganizations of the platelet cytoskeleton are crucial for platelet shape change and secretion and are thought to involve activation of the small GTPase RhoA. In this study, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo consequences of megakaryocyte- and platelet-specific RhoA gene deletion in mice. We found a pronounced macrothrombocytopenia in RhoA-deficient mice, with platelet counts of approximately half that of wild-type controls. The mutant cells displayed an altered shape but only a moderately reduced life span. Shape change of RhoA-deficient platelets in response to G(13)-coupled agonists was abolished, and it was impaired in response to G(q) stimulation. Similarly, RhoA was required for efficient secretion of alpha and dense granules downstream of G(13) and G(q). Furthermore, RhoA was essential for integrin-mediated clot retraction but not for actomyosin rearrangements and spreading of activated platelets on fibrinogen. In vivo, RhoA deficiency resulted in markedly prolonged tail bleeding times but also significant protection in different models of arterial thrombosis and in a model of ischemic stroke.

It is associated with diffuse white matter abnormalities and small deep cerebral ischemic infarcts. The molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of SVD are unclear. As hypertension is a major risk factor for developing SVD, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) are considered an appropriate experimental model for SVD. Prior work suggested an imbalance between the number of blood microvessels and astrocytes at the level of the neurovascular unit in 2-month-old SHR, leading to neuronal hypoxia in the brain of 9-month-old animals. To identify genes and pathways involved in the development of SVD, we compared the gene expression profile in the cortex of 2 and 9-month-old of SHR with age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats using microarray-based technology. The results revealed significant differences in expression of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolisms, mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress and ischemic responses between both groups. These results strongly suggest that SHR suffer from chronic hypoxia, and therefore are unable to tolerate ischemia-like conditions, and are more vulnerable to high-energy needs than WKY.

Structural changes in small arterioles and adjacent tissue were studied using antibodies to investigate different components of the neurovascular unit. We quantified staining in three standard regions, at two coronal levels. RESULTS: Immunostaining for claudin-5, a marker of endothelial tight junctions, was reduced in SHRSP at all ages compared to age-matched WKY controls. Smooth muscle actin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 were increased in SHRSP vs. WKY by 16 weeks. Additionally, 21-week-old WKY and SHRSP rats fed a high-salt diet showed differences in claudin-5, glial fibrillary acidic protein and matrix metalloproteinase 9 staining compared to those fed a normal diet.

In cerebral ischemia, vascular permeability in the brain is an important issue because regulation failure of it results in edema formation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. To determine the role of ASK1 on vascular permeability and edema formation following cerebral ischemia, we first investigated ASK1-related gene expression using microarray analyses of ischemic brain tissue. We then measured protein levels of ASK1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in brain endothelial cells after hypoxia injury. We also examined protein expression of ASK1 and VEGF, edema formation, and morphological alteration through cresyl violet staining in ischemic brain tissue using ASK1-small interference RNA (ASK1-siRNA). Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed to examine VEGF and aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) expression in ischemic brain injury.

There is a lack of randomized controlled trial data in this field. Case series suggest that patients who are recanalized have much better outcomes than those who are not, and it is generally accepted that intra-arterial techniques achieve high rates of recanalization. Controversially, several studies, including a meta-analysis and registry-based investigation, that have compared intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial treatment suggest similar outcomes. However, there are many potential sources of bias in each of these studies, precluding a firm conclusion. Indeed, there are many confounding factors that can influence the outcome including severity of presentation, site of occlusion, clot load, degree of collateral flow, timing of therapy, agent used for recanalization and dose of thrombolytic agent. Additionally, pretreatment infarct core imaging using diffusion-weighted imaging and the posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS) scoring systems have been shown to predict outcome and therefore may be useful in selecting patients for aggressive therapy. Protocols combining intravenous agents such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists or thombolytics agents with intra-arterial techniques ('bridging' therapy) have shown encouraging improvements in neurological outcome and survival. Furthermore, initial case series describing the use of mechanical clot extraction devices or aspiration catheters suggest high rates of recanalization.

Whether blood flow is controlled solely by arteriole smooth muscle, or also by capillary pericytes, is controversial. We demonstrate that neuronal activity and the neurotransmitter glutamate evoke the release of messengers that dilate capillaries by actively relaxing pericytes. Dilation is mediated by prostaglandin E2, but requires nitric oxide release to suppress vasoconstricting 20-HETE synthesis. In vivo, when sensory input increases blood flow, capillaries dilate before arterioles and are estimated to produce 84% of the blood flow increase. In pathology, ischaemia evokes capillary constriction by pericytes. We show that this is followed by pericyte death in rigor, which may irreversibly constrict capillaries and damage the blood-brain barrier. Thus, pericytes are major regulators of cerebral blood flow and initiators of functional imaging signals.

Only very limited therapeutical options are available for a small proportion of stroke patients in the acute phase.

These delayed mechanisms include important pathophysiological pathways such as post-stroke inflammation, angiogenesis, neuronal plasticity and regeneration. In order to analyze these mechanisms and to subsequently evaluate novel drug targets, experimental stroke models with clinical relevance, low mortality and high reproducibility are sought after. Moreover, mice are the smallest mammals in which a focal stroke lesion can be induced and for which a broad spectrum of transgenic models are available.

Although a protective effect of melatonin (ML) has been reported for ICH, its detailed mechanisms and effects on remote brain injury remain unclear. To clarify the mechanism of indirect neuroprotection after ICH, we first investigated whether ML improved motor function after ICH and then examined the underlying mechanisms. The ICH model rat was made by collagenase injection into the left globus pallidus, adjacent to the internal capsule. ML oral administration (15 mg/kg) for 7 days after ICH resulted in significant recovery of motor function. Retrograde labeling of the corticospinal tract by Fluoro-Gold revealed a significant increase in numbers of positive neurons in the cerebral cortex. Immunohistological analysis showed that ML treatment induced no difference in OX41-positive activated microglia/macrophage at day 1 (D1) but a significant reduction in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosin-positive cells at D7. Neutral red assay revealed that ML significantly prevented H2 O2 -induced cell death in cultured oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not in neurons. Electrophysiological response in the cerebral cortex area where the number of Fluoro-Gold-positive cells was increased was significantly improved in ML-treated rats.

This study extended the investigation to determine CNPase expression in activated microglia derived from cell culture and animal models of brain injury with the objective to clarify its putative functions. METHODS: Three-day-old Wistar rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to induce microglial activation, and the rats were killed at different time points. Along with this, primary cultured microglial cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and expression of CNPase was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR and immunofluorescence. Additionally, siRNA transfection was employed to downregulate CNPase in BV-2 cells. Following this, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were determined at mRNA and protein levels. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were also assessed by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay, respectively. In parallel to this, CNPase expression in activated microglia was also investigated in adult rats subjected to fluid percussion injury as well as middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: In vivo, CNPase immunofluorescence in activated microglia was markedly enhanced after lipopolysaccharide treatment. A similar feature was observed in the rat brain after fluid percussion injury and middle cerebral artery occlusion. In vitro, CNPase protein and mRNA expression was increased in primary microglia with lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Remarkably, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide were significantly upregulated in activated BV-2 cells with CNPase knockdown. siRNA knockdown of CNPase increased microglia migration; on the other hand, microglial cells appeared to be arrested at G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: The present results have provided the first morphological and molecular evidence that CNPase expression is increased in activated microglia. CNPase knockdown resulted in increased expression of various inflammatory mediators. It is concluded that CNPase may play an important role as a putative anti-inflammatory gene both in normal and injured brain.",2014,Journal Article,J Neuroinflammation,L.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (270-330 g) underwent permanent MCAo. Neurological function was evaluated on days 1, 2 and 3 after MCAo. We studied six groups: DHA (5 mg/kg), Alb (0.63 or 1.25 g/kg), DHA-Alb (5 mg/kg+0.63 g/kg or 5 mg/kg+1.25 g/kg) or saline. Treatment was administered i.v. at 3 h after onset of stroke (n = 7-10 per group). Ex vivo imaging of brains and histopathology were conducted on day 3. Saline- and Alb-treated rats developed severe neurological deficits but were not significantly different from one another. In contrast, rats treated with low and moderate doses of DHA-Alb showed improved neurological score compared to corresponding Alb groups on days 2 and 3. Total, cortical and subcortical lesion volumes computed from T2 weighted images were reduced following a moderate dose of DHA-Alb (1.25 g/kg) by 25%, 22%, 34%, respectively, compared to the Alb group. The total corrected, cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were reduced by low (by 36-40%) and moderate doses (by 34-42%) of DHA-Alb treatment compared to the Alb groups. In conclusion, DHA-Alb therapy is highly neuroprotective in permanent MCAo in rats.

We previously showed that the IL-23/IL-17 axis aggravates immune injury after cerebral infarction in mice. However, IL-23 might activate other cytokines and transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) production in cerebral ischemia. We aimed to determine whether IL-23p19 knockdown prevents cerebral ischemic injury by reducing ischemic-induced inflammation. METHODS: Ischemic stroke models were established by permanent middle cerebral arterial occlusion (pMCAO) in male C57BL/6 mice. In vivo gene knockdown was achieved by intravenous delivery of lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding IL-23p19 short hairpin RNA (LV-IL-23p19 shRNA). Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed inhibitory efficiency. Behavioral deficits were evaluated by adhesive-removal somatic-sensory test. Brain infarct volume was measured at day 5 after pMCAO by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Expression of IL-17, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-gamma and Foxp3 in ischemic brain tissues were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining located cytokines in ischemic brain tissues. RESULTS: RNA interference knockdown of IL-23p19 resulted in improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume. IL-23p19 knockdown suppressed IL-17 gene and protein expression. Moreover, IL-23p19 deficiency enhanced IFN-gamma and Foxp3 expressions in delayed cerebral ischemic mice, and did not impact IL-4 expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IL-17, IL-4, IFN-gamma and Foxp3-positive cells were located around ischemic lesions of the ipsilateral hemisphere.

An imaging method with structural and functional information is necessary for diagnosis of stroke. This study applies QSM-mMRV (quantitative susceptibility mapping-based microscopic magnetic resonance venography) for noninvasively detecting small cerebral venous vessels in rat stroke model. First, susceptibility mapping is optimized and calculated from magnetic resonance (MR) phase images of a rat brain. Subsequently, QSM-mMRV is used to simultaneously provide information on microvascular architecture and venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), both of which can be used to evaluate the physiological and functional characteristics of microvascular changes for longitudinally monitoring and therapeutically evaluating a disease model. Morphologically, the quantification of vessel sizes using QSM-mMRV was 30% smaller than that of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which eliminated the overestimation of conventional SWI. Functionally, QSM-mMRV estimated an average SvO2 ranging from 73% to 85% for healthy rats. Finally, we also applied QSM to monitor the revascularization of post-stroke vessels from 3 to 10 days after reperfusion.

Various members of the sirtuin class have been found to be involved in processes related to longevity, regulation of inflammation, and neuroprotection. Induction of Sirt2 mRNA was found in the whole hemisphere after experimental stroke in a recent screening approach. Moreover, Sirt2 protein is highly expressed in myelin-rich brain regions after stroke. To examine the effects of Sirt2 on ischemic stroke, we induced transient focal cerebral ischemia in adult male Sirt2-knockout and wild-type mice. Two stroke models with different occlusion times were applied: a severe ischemia (45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)) and a mild one (15 minutes of MCAO), which was used to focus on subcortical infarcts. Neurological deficit was determined at 48 hours after 45 minutes of MCAO, and up to 7 days after induction of 15 minutes of cerebral ischemia. In contrast to recent data on Sirt1, Sirt2(-/-) mice showed less neurological deficits in both models of experimental stroke, with the strongest manifestation after 48 hours of reperfusion. However, we did not observe a significant difference of stroke volumes or inflammatory cell count between Sirt2-deficient and wild-type mice.

However, the temporal relationship between performance gains and map plasticity is not clear. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the effects of rehabilitative training on the temporal dynamics of behavioral and neurophysiological endpoints in a rat model of focal cortical infarct. METHODS: Eight days after an ischemic infarct in primary motor cortex, adult rats received either rehabilitative training or were allowed to recover spontaneously. Motor performance and movement quality of the paretic forelimb was assessed on a skilled reach task. Intracortical microstimulation mapping procedures were conducted to assess the topography of spared forelimb representations either at the end of training (post-lesion day 18) or at the end of a 3-week follow-up period (post-lesion day 38). RESULTS: Rats receiving rehabilitative training demonstrated more rapid improvement in motor performance and movement quality during the training period that persisted through the follow-up period. Motor maps in both groups were unusually small on post-lesion day 18. On post-lesion day 38, forelimb motor maps in the rehabilitative training group were significantly enlarged compared with the no-rehab group, and within the range of normal maps. CONCLUSIONS: Postinfarct rehabilitative training rapidly improves motor performance and movement quality after an ischemic infarct in motor cortex.

Here, we focus on cerebral abnormalities preceding lesions detectable by MRI. METHODS: Longitudinal assessment of brain histology was performed in salt-loaded male SHRSPs (n = 26) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive control animals (n = 27). Groups of rats were sacrificed at different time points: Time 0, before the salt diet administration; Time 1, when proteinuria achieved 40 mg/day; Time 2, when proteinuria exceeded 100 mg/day. RESULTS: At Time 0, no brain lesions were observed. At Time 1, changes of the cortical penetrating arteries, vasogenic oedema, lacunae and focal cell loss appeared in SHRSPs and worsened at Time 2, although no lesions were yet detected by MRI. Staining for proliferation markers revealed a significant boost of cellular mitosis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of SHRSPs. Moreover, we observed higher immunopositivity for nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and doublecortin (markers for neural stem cells, astrocytes and immature neurons, respectively). At Time 2, apoptotic caspase-3 as well as 4-hydroxynonenal-positive neurons were associated to decreased nestin and doublecortin staining. High expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were maintained in the SVZ. No comparative alterations and SVZ activation were recorded in WKYs. CONCLUSION: Appearance of vascular changes in SHRSPs, before any MRI-detectable brain lesion, is coupled to active neural proliferation in the SVZ.

We present a technique for visualizing the changing distribution of iodine in the cardiac cycle with dual source micro-CT. METHODS: The approach entails a retrospectively gated dual energy scan with optimized filters and voltages, and a series of computational operations to reconstruct the data. Projection interpolation and five-dimensional bilateral filtration (three spatial dimensions + time + energy) are used to reduce noise and artifacts associated with retrospective gating. We reconstruct separate volumes corresponding to different cardiac phases and apply a linear transformation to decompose these volumes into components representing concentrations of water and iodine. Since the resulting material images are still compromised by noise, we improve their quality in an iterative process that minimizes the discrepancy between the original acquired projections and the projections predicted by the reconstructed volumes. The values in the voxels of each of the reconstructed volumes represent the coefficients of linear combinations of basis functions over time and energy. We have implemented the reconstruction algorithm on a graphics processing unit (GPU) with CUDA. We tested the utility of the technique in simulations and applied the technique in an in vivo scan of a C57BL6 mouse injected with blood pool contrast agent at a dose of 0.01 mlg body weight. Postreconstruction, at each cardiac phase in the iodine images, we segmented the left ventricle and computed its volume. Using the maximum and minimum volumes in the left ventricle, we calculated the stroke volume, the ejection fraction, and the cardiac output. RESULTS: Our proposed method produces five-dimensional volumetric images that distinguish different materials at different points in time, and can be used to segment regions containing iodinated blood and compute measures of cardiac function.

Flow simulations were run before and after virtually deploying the flow diverters, assuming distal resistances remained unchanged after treatment. All jailed arteries remained patent angiographically 8 weeks after treatment. The computational models estimated decreases compared to pretreatment in the mean flow rates between 2% and 20% and in peak flow rates between 5% and 36%. The major changes were observed during systole. Flow patterns did not exhibit recirculation zones before treatment. Implantation of the flow diverters altered the flow structure only locally near the device wires. No major recirculation regions were created or destroyed. Flow diverters seem safe with respect to perforator or side branch occlusion.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been in clinical use for the treatment of diabetes and also been reported to be neuroprotective in ischemic stroke. The quinoxaline 6,7-dichloro-2-methylsulfonyl-3-N-tert- butylaminoquinoxaline (DMB) is an agonist and allosteric modulator of the GLP-1R with the potential to increase the affinity of GLP-1 for its receptor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of DMB on transient focal cerebral ischemia. In cultured cortical neurons, DMB activated the GLP-1R, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels with an EC50 value about 100 fold that of exendin-4. Pretreatment of neurons with DMB protected against necrotic and apoptotic cell death was induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The neuroprotective effects of DMB were blocked by GLP-1R knockdown with shRNA but not by GLP-1R antagonism. In C57BL/6 mice, DMB was orally administered 30 min prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. DMB markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficits caused by MCAO and reperfusion. The neuroprotective effects were mediated by activation of the GLP-1R through the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway. DMB exhibited anti-apoptotic effects by modulating Bcl-2 family members. These results provide evidence that DMB, a small molecular GLP-1R agonist, attenuates transient focal cerebral ischemia injury and inhibits neuronal apoptosis induced by MCAO.

We examined whether the silence of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by siRNA protects brain tissues from ischemic injury. In three groups of Wistar rats, their lateral ventricles received the injections of lentiviral vectors carrying siRNA for PAR1, small RNA in mismatching PAR1 or saline. A week after the injections, these rats were treated by one side of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The scores of neurological deficits, the volume of ischemic infarction and the expressions of PAR-1, HSP-70 and MAP-2 were measured in 24h of MCAO.

The lesions prone to result in such clinical events are termed vulnerable or high-risk plaques, and their identification may lead to the development of pharmacological and mechanical intervention strategies to prevent such events. Autopsy studies from patients dying of acute myocardial infarction or sudden death have shown that such events typically arise from specific types of atherosclerotic plaques, most commonly the thin-cap fibroatheroma. However, the search in human beings for vulnerable plaques before their becoming symptomatic has been elusive. Recently, the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree) study demonstrated that coronary plaques that are likely to cause future cardiac events, regardless of angiographic severity, are characterized by large plaque burden and small lumen area and/or are thin-cap fibroatheromas verified by radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound imaging. This study opened the door to identifying additional invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities that may improve detection of high-risk atherosclerotic lesions and patients.

On a clinical electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronized 1.5 T MRI scanner we therefore studied cardiac function parameters of mice with chronic virus-induced cardiomyopathy. Thus, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) could be verified compared to healthy controls. However, our results showed a high variability. First, anesthesia with medetomidine, midazolam and fentanyl (MMF) led to depressed cardiac function parameters and more variability than isoflurane gas inhalation anesthesia, especially at high concentrations. Furthermore, calculation of an average ejection fraction value from sequenced scans significantly reduced the variance of the results. To sum up, we introduce the clinical 1.5 T MRI device as a new tool for effective analysis of left ventricular function in mice with cardiomyopathy.

Neurological deficits, as evaluated by the corner test, were less severe in the MOMC-transplanted rats than in macrophage-transplanted or mock-treated rats. Histological evaluations revealed that the number of microvessels that had formed in the ischemic boundary area by 4 weeks after transplantation was significantly greater in the MOMC-transplanted rats than in the control groups. The blood vessel formation was preceded by the appearance of round CD31(+) cells, which we confirmed were derived from the transplanted MOMCs. Small numbers of bloodvessels incorporating MOMC-derived endothelial cells expressing a mature endothelial marker RECA-1 were detected at 4 weeks after transplantation.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40) underwent either sham surgery or bilateral endothelin-1 injections in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus or in the medial prefrontal cortex. Executive function was assessed using a rodent attention set shifting test that requires animals to shift attention to stimuli in different stimulus dimensions. Medial prefrontal cortex ischemia impaired attention shift performance between different stimulus dimensions while sparing stimulus discrimination and attention shifts within a stimulus dimension, indicating a selective attention set-shift deficit. Rats with mediodorsal thalamic lacunar damage did not exhibit a cognitive impairment relative to sham controls. The selective attention set shift impairment observed in this study is consistent with clinical data demonstrating selective executive disorders following stroke within specific sub-regions of frontal cortex.

HO-1 is an inducible isoform whereas HO-2 is constitutive. Stroke strongly induces HO-1 expression but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Cytokines that are up-regulated after ischemia, like interleukin (IL)-10, can induce HO-1 gene expression, which is positively regulated by the transcriptional activator nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) associated C-terminal helicase 1 (Bach-1). While Nrf2 is activated after ischemia and drugs promoting Nrf2 activation increase HO-1 and are beneficial, the involvement of Bach-1 is unknown. Here we investigated mechanisms involved in HO-1 induction and evaluated the effects of HO activity inhibition in mouse permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). HO-1 was induced after ischemia in IL-10-deficient mice suggesting that post-ischemic HO-1 induction was IL-10-independent. Attenuation of Bach-1 gene repression after ischemia was associated to enhanced HO-1 induction. Administration of the HO activity inhibitor zinc proto-porphyrin IX (ZnPP) i.p. 24h before pMCAO exacerbated ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1beta, nitro-oxidative stress, and the presence of neutrophils at 8h, and increased infarct volume at day 4. However, ZnPP did not worsen ischemic damage when given 30min before pMCAO. ZnPP induced HO-1 expression in the cerebral vasculature at 24h, when it was still detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in plasma. While ZnPP was not found in brain tissue extracts of controls, it could be detected after ischemia, supporting that a small fraction of the injected drug can reach the tissue following blood-brain barrier breakdown. The deleterious effect of inhibiting HO activity in ischemia became apparent in the presence of ZnPP-induced HO-1, which is known to exert effects independent of its enzymatic activity. In conclusion, HO-1 induction after ischemia was associated to down-regulation of transcriptional repressor Bach-1, and induction of HO-1 when HO enzymatic activity was inhibited was related to worst outcome after brain ischemia.",2013,Journal Article,Neuroscience,I.

Within 3 weeks, this lesion develops into a single lacuna-like cavity, which is fluid-filled and encapsulated by reactive astrocytes. Minocycline treatment that commences 1 hr after lesion and continues for 6 days prevents the cavitation and causes a filling of the lesion with reactive astrocytes and no barrier. Here, we determined whether inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMPs) mediates this minocycline action. Confocal microscopy revealed increased punctate staining of MMPs inside the lesion sites after 2 days of PVD. Astrocytes lined the lesion border but showed sparse localization inside the lesion. In contrast, increased MMP levels inside the lesion coincided with increased ED1 or OX-42 immunostaining, suggesting that MMP elevation reflected increased secretions from microglia/macrophages. Imaging analyses also revealed that minocycline administered for 2 days before animal euthanasia, significantly decreased MMP levels within the lesion. Moreover, Western blot analysis of cortical tissue extracts showed a significant 30-40% upregulation of MMPs 2 days after lesion. Minocycline administered 2 hr before the lesion significantly inhibited both MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels by approximately 40%. In contrast, minocycline administered 1 hr after the lesion only decreased MMP-9 levels by approximately 30%. Because MMP inhibition with batimastat injection also prevented cavity formation at 21 days, we conclude that minocycline prevented the creation of a lacuna-like cyst in the cerebral cortex by inhibiting the MMP secretion from microglia in the affected tissue.",2013,Journal Article,J Neurosci Res,F.

This study was performed to evaluate the endothelial status when using a Solitaire system in a canine arterial occlusion model. Thromboembolic occlusion of both internal maxillary arteries was achieved in five mongrel dogs. In each animal, the Solitaire system (ev3, Irvine, CA, USA) was used for primary thrombectomy on the right side and for temporary stenting on the left side. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the recanalization rates, and safety was assessed using angiographic and microscopic assessments. Endothelial injuries were evaluated with light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Successful revascularizations were observed following primary thrombectomy in all five animals (100%) and after temporary stenting in two (40%). There was no incidence of vasospasm or vessel perforation in either group. Distal migration of the clot occurred in two animals that underwent primary thrombectomy. Endothelial injury was seen after primary thrombectomy in two animals (40%) and after temporary stenting in one (20%). The lesions presented as defects of the internal elastic lamina on LM and denudation of the wavy endothelial surface on SEM. During mechanical thrombectomy, the Solitaire system can cause endothelial injury both in primary thrombectomy and temporary stenting.

The pathophysiology of SVD is not well understood and is hampered by a limited range of relevant animal models. Here, we describe gliovascular alterations and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of sustained cerebral hypoperfusion with features of SVD (microinfarcts, hemorrhage, white matter disruption) induced by bilateral common carotid stenosis. Multiple features of SVD were determined on T2-weighted and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed by pathologic assessment. These features, which were absent in sham controls, included multiple T2-hyperintense infarcts and T2-hypointense hemosiderin-like regions in subcortical nuclei plus increased cerebral atrophy compared with controls. Fractional anisotropy was also significantly reduced in several white matter structures including the corpus callosum. Investigation of gliovascular changes revealed a marked increase in microvessel diameter, vascular wall disruption, fibrinoid necrosis, hemorrhage, and blood-brain barrier alterations. Widespread reactive gliosis, including displacement of the astrocytic water channel, aquaporin 4, was observed. Hypoperfused mice also demonstrated deficits in spatial working and reference memory tasks.

Brain ischemia induces the expression of Gadd45b, which stimulates recovery after stroke and may play a protective role in cerebral ischemia. However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms of how Gadd45b expression regulated and the down-stream targets in brain ischemia. Here, using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) model, we identified Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1, a HECT domain containing ubiquitin ligase, involved in the control of Gadd45b protein level. In this study, we also investigated the role of Huwe1-Gadd45b mediated pathway in BDNF methylation. RESULTS: We found that the depletion of Huwe1 by lentivirus shRNA mediated interference significantly increased the expression of Gadd45b and BDNF at 24 h after OGD. Moreover, treatment with Cycloheximide (CHX) inhibited endogenous expression of Gadd45b, and promoted expression of Gadd45b after co-treated with lentivirus shRNA-Huwe1. Inhibition of Gadd45b by lentivirus shRNA decreased the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) pathway, while inhibition of Huwe1 increased the expression levels of BDNF and p-CREB. Moreover, shRNA-Huwe1 treatment decreased the methylation level of the fifth CpG islands (123 bp apart from BDNF IXa), while shRNA-Gadd45b treatment increased the methylation level of the forth CpG islands (105 bp apart from BDNF IXa). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that Huwe1 involved in the regulation of Gadd45b expression under OGD/R, providing a novel route for neurons following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. It also indicated that the methylation of BDNF IXa was affected by Gadd45b as well as Huwe1 in the OGD/R model.",2015,Journal Article,Mol Brain,G. Q.

Currently, only 4D flow MRI is able to visualize and quantify potential retrograde embolization pathways in the DAo in-vivo. Hence, it was our aim to test if the extent of retrograde flow could be estimated by routine 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). METHODS: Forty-eight acute stroke patients were prospectively included and they underwent Doppler examinations of the transition zone between the aortic arch and the DAo using a 20 mm 2D sample volume in longitudinal section at 90-140 degrees Doppler angle during routine TEE. Velocity-time-integrals (VTI) were studied for antegrade and retrograde velocities and the ratio (VTIratio) was calculated and correlated with the length of retrograde pathlines at that site, which were visualized using 4D flow MRI at 3-Tesla. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate a threshold value of VTIratio in differentiating large (>/=3 cm) from small (<3 cm) retrograde flow extent. RESULTS: At the TEE measurement site, the mean VTIratio was 0.53 +/- 0.16 and the mean length of retrograde pathlines reaching back into the aortic arch was 3.1 +/- 1.4 cm. VTIratio was an independent predictor of retrograde pathline length (r = 0.44; p = 0.002). ROC analysis identified a VTIratio threshold value of 0.6012 with a sensitivity of 0.5, a specificity of 0.92, and positive and negative predictive values of 0.84 and 0.68, respectively. Accordingly, 11 (22.91%) patients had a VTIratio cutoff value >/=0.6012 and corresponding retrograde pathline length >/=3 cm in 4D flow MRI. CONCLUSIONS: TEE allows predicting the length of retrograde pathlines. Hence, it may offer a cost-effective way to investigate independent predictors of DAo flow reversal in large-scale studies. However, TEE is only of limited value as a screening tool for high retrograde flow in a clinical setting, as only approximately 23% of patients can be spared 4D flow MRI, which remains indispensable for the exact assessment of individual embolization pathways from plaques of the DAo in-vivo.",2015,Journal Article,Cerebrovasc Dis,T.

Past work has shown that occlusion of individual cortical microvessels as well as large-scale hemorrhages can lead to degeneration of neurons and increased inflammation. Using two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy in anesthetized mice, we characterized the acute and chronic dynamics of vessel bleeding, tissue compression, blood flow change, neural degeneration, and inflammation following a microhemorrhage caused by rupturing a single penetrating arteriole with tightly-focused femtosecond laser pulses. We quantified the extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) and blood plasma into the brain and determined that the bleeding was limited by clotting. The vascular bleeding formed a RBC-filled core that compressed the surrounding parenchymal tissue, but this compression was not sufficient to crush nearby brain capillaries, although blood flow speeds in these vessels was reduced by 20%. Imaging of cortical dendrites revealed no degeneration of the large-scale structure of the dendritic arbor up to 14 days after the microhemorrhage. Dendrites close to the RBC core were displaced by extravasating RBCs but began to relax back one day after the lesion. Finally, we observed a rapid inflammatory response characterized by morphology changes in microglia/macrophages up to 200 microm from the microhemorrhage as well as extension of cellular processes into the RBC core. This inflammation persisted over seven days. Taken together, our data suggest that a cortical microhemorrhage does not directly cause significant neural pathology but does trigger a sustained, local inflammatory response.",2011,Journal Article,PLoS One,N.

We have reported that CysLT2R is involved in neuronal injury, astrocytosis, and microgliosis, and that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the selective CysLT2R antagonist HAMI 3379 protects against acute brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. In the present study, we clarified features of the protective effect of intraperitoneally-injected HAMI 3379 in rats. We found that HAMI 3379 attenuated the acute brain injury 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with effective doses of 0.1-0.4 mg/kg and a therapeutic window of approximately 1h. It attenuated the neurological deficits, and reduced infarct volume, brain edema, and neuronal loss and degeneration 24 and 72h after MCAO. RNA interference with i.c.v. injection of CysLT2R short hairpin RNA (shRNA) attenuated the acute injury as well. Also, HAMI 3379 inhibited release of the cytokines IL-1beta, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) into the serum and cerebrospinal fluid 24h after MCAO. Moreover, HAMI 3379 ameliorated the microglial activation and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic regions, but did not affect astrocyte proliferation 72h after MCAO. In comparison, the CysLT1R antagonist pranlukast did not affect microglial activation and IFN-gamma release, but inhibited astrocyte proliferation and reduced serum IL-4. Thus, we conclude that HAMI 3379 has a protective effect on acute and subacute ischemic brain injury, and attenuates microglia-related inflammation.

METHODS: We used the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP), the closest spontaneous experimental model of human SVD, and age-matched control rats kept under identical, non-salt-loaded conditions, to perform a blinded analysis of mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR and pathway analysis in two brain regions (frontal and mid-coronal) commonly affected by SVD in the SHRSP at age five, 16 and 21 weeks.

All were present at age 5 weeks thus predating blood pressure elevation. 'Neurological' and 'inflammatory' pathways were more affected than 'vascular' functional pathways.

Male, 8- to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) either immediately or 24 h after receiving IOX3. Mice receiving IOX3 at 20 mg/kg 24 h prior to the MCAO had better neuroscores and smaller blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and infarct volumes than mice receiving the vehicle, whereas those having IOX3 at 60 mg/kg showed no significant changes. IOX3 treatment immediately before MCAO was not neuroprotective. IOX3 up-regulated HIF-1alpha, and increased EPO expression in mouse brains. In an in vitro BBB model (RBE4 cell line), IOX3 up-regulated HIF-1alpha and delocalized ZO-1. Pre-treating IOX3 on RBE4 cells 24 h before oxygen-glucose deprivation had a protective effect on endothelial barrier preservation with ZO-1 being better localized, while immediate IOX3 treatment did not. Our study suggests that HIF stabilization with IOX3 before cerebral ischaemia is neuroprotective partially because of BBB protection, while immediate application could be detrimental. These results provide information for studies aimed at the therapeutic activation of HIF pathway for neurovascular protection from cerebral ischaemia. We show that IOX3, a selective small molecule (280.66 Da) HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, could up-regulate HIF-1alpha and increase erythropoietin expression in mice.

Despite improvements in the field of diagnostic imaging, options for prevention and medical treatment-primarily with the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine or hemodynamic manipulations-are insufficient. Previous studies have suggested that heme and bilirubin oxidation end products, originating from degraded hemoglobin around ruptured blood vessels, are involved in the development of vasospasm by inhibiting large conductance BKC a potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study, we identify individual heme degradation products regulating arteriolar diameter in dependence of BKC a channel activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using differential interference contrast video microscopy in acute brain slices, we determined diameter changes of intracerebral arterioles in mouse visual cortex. In preconstricted vessels, the specific BKC a channel blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin as well as iron-containing hemin caused vasoconstriction. In addition, the bilirubin oxidation end product Z-BOX A showed a stronger vasoconstrictive potency than its regio-isomer Z-BOX B. Importantly, Z-BOX A had the same vasoconstrictive effect, independent of its origin from oxidative degradation or chemical synthesis. Finally, in slices of Slo1-deficient knockout mice, paxilline and Z-BOX A remained ineffective in changing arteriole diameter. CONCLUSIONS: We identified individual components of the oxidative bilirubin degradation that led to vasoconstriction of cerebral arterioles.

At 2 h after EA pretreatment, focal cerebral ischemic injury was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 min in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of Mn-SOD in the penumbra was assessed by Western blot and immunoflourescent staining at 2 h after reperfusion. In the presence or absence of Mn-SOD small interfering RNA (siRNA), the neurological deficit score, the infarct volume, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and oxidative stress were evaluated. Furthermore, the Mn-SOD protein expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 were also determined in the presence and absence of CB1R antagonists (AM251, SR141716) and CB1R agonists (arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA), WIN 55,212-2). EA pretreatment upregulated the Mn-SOD protein expression and Mn-SOD-positive neuronal cells at 2 h after reperfusion. EA pretreatment also attenuated oxidative stress, inhibited cellular apoptosis, and induced neuroprotection against ischemic damage, whereas these beneficial effects of EA pretreatment were reversed by knockdown of Mn-SOD. Mn-SOD upregulation and STAT3 phosphorylation by EA pretreatment were abolished by two CB1R antagonists, while pretreatment with two CB1R agonists increased the expression of Mn-SOD and phosphorylation level of STAT3.

Transplantation of subventricular zone (SVZ) derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is a promising strategy for promotion of neurological recovery. Yet, fundamental questions including the optimal cell delivery route still have to be addressed. Consequently, male C57BL6 mice were exposed to transient focal cerebral ischemia and allowed to survive for as long as 84 days post-stroke. At 6h post-stroke, NPCs were grafted using six different cell delivery routes, i.e., intravenous, intraarterial, ipsilateral intrastriatal, contralateral intrastriatal, ipsilateral intraventricular and ipsilateral intracortical injection. Control mice received PBS only using the aforementioned delivery routes. Intralesional numbers of GFP(+) NPCs were high only after ipsilateral intrastriatal transplantation, whereas other injection paradigms only yielded comparatively small numbers of grafted cells. However, acute neuroprotection and improved functional outcome were observed after both systemic (i.e., intraarterial and intravenous) and ipsilateral intrastriatal transplantation only. Whereas systemic cell delivery induced acute and long-term neuroprotection, reduction of brain injury after ipsilateral intrastriatal cell grafting was only temporary, in line with the loss of transplanted NPCs in the brain. Both systemic and ipsilateral intrastriatal NPC delivery reduced microglial activation and leukocyte invasion, thus reducing free radical formation within the ischemic brain. On the contrary, only systemic NPC administration stabilized the blood-brain-barrier and reduced leukocytosis in the blood. Although intraarterial NPC transplantation was as effective as intravenous cell grafting, mortality of stroke mice was high using the intraarterial delivery route. Consequently, intravenous delivery of native NPCs in our experimental model is an attractive and effective strategy for stroke therapy that deserves further proof-of-concept studies.",2015,Journal Article,Exp Neurol,T.

These strategies most often employ (super)paramagnetic contrast agents, such as (ultra)small particles of iron oxide and gadolinium chelates, for MRI-based detection of specific leukocyte populations or molecular inflammatory markers that are involved in the pathophysiology of stroke or plasticity. In this review we describe achievements, limitations and prospects in the field of cellular and molecular MRI of neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical stroke. Several studies in rodent stroke models have demonstrated the application of MRI contrast agents for imaging of monocyte infiltration, which served as the foundation for pilot (small-scale proof-of-concept) cellular MRI studies in stroke patients. This may be achieved with isolated cells that are loaded with contrast agent through in vitro incubation prior to systemic administration. Alternatively, superparamagnetic iron oxide particles may be directly injected into the circulation to allow in vivo uptake by phagocytic cells. Both strategies have been successfully employed to measure the spatiotemporal profile of invasion of monocytes in and around cerebral ischemic lesions in experimental stroke models. Molecular MRI studies with target-specific contrast agents have shown the capability for in vivo detection of molecular markers after experimental stroke. For example, (super)paramagnetic micro- or nanoparticles that are functionalized with a ligand (e.g. an antibody) for specific cell adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), can target inflamed, activated endothelium, whose presence can subsequently be detected with MRI. Present applications remain limited as most of the currently available contrast agents provide relatively poor contrast enhancement, which is not easily discriminated from endogenous sources of tissue contrast. Nevertheless, current developments of more efficient particles, such as biocompatible liposomes, micelles and nanoemulsions that can contain high payloads of (super)paramagnetic material as well as other substances, such as dyes and drugs, may open a window of opportunities for promising translational multimodal imaging strategies that enable in vivo assessment of (neuroinflammatory) disease markers, therapeutic targets as well as drug delivery after stroke.",2012,Journal Article,Cerebrovasc Dis,L.

In the current study we have quantitatively assessed the age-dependent changes of the cortical vasculature in the arcAbeta model of cerebral amyloidosis. To estimate the density of the cortical microvasculature in vivo, we used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance microangiography (CE-muMRA). Three-dimensional gradient echo datasets with 60 mum isotropic resolution were acquired in 4- and 24-month-old arcAbeta mice and compared with wild-type (wt) control mice of the same age before and after administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. After segmentation of the cortical vasculature from difference images, an automated algorithm was applied for assessing the number and size distribution of intracortical vessels. With CE-muMRA, cerebral arteries and veins with a diameter of less than the nominal pixel resolution (60 mum) can be visualized. A significant age-dependent reduction in the number of functional intracortical microvessels (radii of 20-80 mum) has been observed in 24-month-old arcAbeta mice compared with age-matched wt mice, whereas there was no difference between transgenic and wt mice of 4 months of age. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong fibrinogen and Abeta deposition in small- and medium-sized vessels, but not in large cerebral arteries, of 24-month-old arcAbeta mice. The reduced density of transcortical vessels may thus be attributed to impaired perfusion and vascular occlusion caused by deposition of Abeta and fibrin. The study demonstrated that remodeling of the cerebrovasculature can be monitored noninvasively with CE-muMRA in mice.",2012,Journal Article,J Neurosci,J.

We sought to assess whether pharmacological inhibition of PLD activity affects hemostasis, thrombosis, and thrombo-inflammatory brain infarction in mice. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Treatment of platelets with the reversible, small molecule PLD inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI), led to a specific blockade of PLD activity that was associated with reduced alpha-granule release and integrin activation. Mice that received FIPI at a dose of 3 mg/kg displayed reduced occlusive thrombus formation upon chemical injury of carotid arteries or mesenterial arterioles. Similarly, FIPI-treated mice had smaller infarct sizes and significantly better motor and neurological function 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. This protective effect was not associated with major intracerebral hemorrhage or prolonged tail bleeding times.

Drugs to prevent atherosclerosis complication such as thrombotic strokes, should be drugs able to prevent the accumulation of intravascular fat, reduce vascular proliferation, decrease blood pressure levels with the resulting shear stress, reduce platelet aggregation, and possibly partially or totally reverse carotid plaques. Any of the commonly used antihypertensive drugs lower the incidence of stroke, with larger reductions in BP resulting in larger reductions in risk. Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may have beneficial effects beyond the lowering of blood pressure to reduce stroke incidence. In clinical trials, statins consistently reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with or without CHD whereas the data on the effects of other lipid modifying drugs on stroke risk are limited. Approximately 25% of strokes are recurrent. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of noncardioembolic minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although clinicians may choose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as first-line therapy for secondary prevention, clinical guidelines and evidence from trials suggest that ASA may not be the most effective strategy. A recent review discussed results from clinical trials that have compared the efficacy of ASA monotherapy versus ASA + extended release dipyridamole in secondary stroke prevention. Therefore it is difficult to extrapolate the real benefit of pharmacological prevention strategies against atherothrombotic subtype for excellence in the TOAST classification subtype that is represented by the LAAS and also with regard to lacunar subtype as an expression of lipohyalinosis process which is a further aspect of atherosclerosis.",2013,Journal Article,Curr Vasc Pharmacol,A.

Indeed, atherosclerotic angiogenesis may be a promising marker of inflammation. In this study, an engineered integrin alphavbeta3-targeting PET probe, (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A, derived from a divalent knottin miniprotein was evaluated in a mouse model for carotid atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques in BALB/C mice, maintained on a high-fat diet, were induced with streptozotocin injection and carotid artery ligation and verified by MR imaging. Knottin 3-4A was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis chemistry and coupled to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) before radiolabeling with (64)Cu. PET probe stability in mouse serum was evaluated. Mice with carotid atherosclerotic plaques were injected via the tail vein with (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A or (18)F-FDG, followed by small-animal PET/CT imaging at different time points. Receptor targeting specificity of the probe was verified by coinjection of c(RGDyK) administered in molar excess. Subsequently, carotid artery dissection and immunofluorescence staining were performed to evaluate target expression. RESULTS: (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A was synthesized in high radiochemical purity and yield and demonstrated molecular stability in both phosphate-buffered saline and mouse serum at 4 h. Small-animal PET/CT showed that (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A accumulated at significantly higher levels in the neovasculature of carotid atherosclerotic plaques (7.41 +/- 1.44 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.23 percentage injected dose/gram, P < 0.05) than healthy or normal vessels at 1 h after injection. (18)F-FDG also accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions at 0.5 and 1 h after injection but at lower plaque-to-normal tissue ratios than (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A. For example, plaque-to-normal carotid artery ratios for (18)F-FDG and (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A at 1 h after injection were 3.75 and 14.71 (P < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, uptake of (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A in atherosclerotic plaques was effectively blocked ( approximately 90% at 1 h after injection) by coinjection of c(RGDyK). Immunostaining confirmed integrin alphavbeta3 expression in both the infiltrating macrophages and the neovasculature of atherosclerotic plaques. CONCLUSION: (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A demonstrates specific accumulation in carotid atherosclerotic plaques in which macrophage infiltration and angiogenesis are responsible for elevated integrin alphavbeta3 levels. Therefore, (64)Cu-NOTA-3-4A may demonstrate clinical utility as a PET probe for atherosclerosis imaging or for the evaluation of therapies used to treat atherosclerosis.",2015,Journal Article,J Nucl Med,L.

PAs were studied isolated and pressurized from 18-wk-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY18; n = 8) and spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone (SHRSP18; n = 8) and 5-wk-old prehypertensive (SHRSP5; n = 8) rats. In separate groups, unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAo) was performed for 4 wk to cause chronic hypoperfusion in 18-wk-old WKY (WKY18-CH; n = 8) and SHRSP (SHRSP18-CH; n = 8). UCCAo caused PAs to have significantly diminished myogenic tone (31 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 6% at 60 mmHg; P < 0.05) and reactivity to pressure from WKY18-CH vs. WKY18 animals. The effect of UCCAo was limited to normotensive animals, as there was little effect of chronic hypoperfusion on vascular reactivity or percent tone in PAs from SHRSP18 vs. SHRSP18-CH animals (53 +/- 4 vs. 41 +/- 3%; P > 0.05). However, PAs from SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 animals had significantly greater tone compared with WKY18, suggesting an effect of strain and not hypertension per se on PA vasoconstriction. Structurally, PAs from SHRSP18 and SHRSP5 animals had similar sized lumen diameters, but increased wall thickness and distensibility compared with WKY18. Interestingly, chronic hypoperfusion did not affect the structure of PAs from either WKY18-CH or SHRSP18-CH animals. Thus PAs responded to UCCAo with active vasodilation, but not structural remodeling, an effect that was absent in SHRSP. The increased tone of PAs from SHRSP animals, combined with lack of response to chronic hypoperfusion, may contribute to the propensity for ischemic lesions and increased perfusion deficit during hypertension.",2015,Journal Article,J Appl Physiol (1985),J.

Dissection was used to determine the distribution of [(18)F]FEBMP in mice, while small-animal PET and metabolite analysis were used for a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. [(18)F]FEBMP showed high radioactivity uptake in mouse peripheral organs enriched with TSPO, and relatively high initial brain uptake (2.67 +/- 0.12% ID/g). PET imaging revealed an increased accumulation of radioactivity in the infarcted striatum, with a maximum ratio of 3.20 +/- 0.12, compared to non-injured striatum. Displacement with specific TSPO ligands lowered the accumulation levels in infarcts to those on the contralateral side. This suggests that the increased accumulation reflected TPSO-specific binding of [(18)F]FEBMP in vivo. Using a simplified reference tissue model, the binding potential on the infarcted area was 2.72 +/- 0.27. Metabolite analysis in brain tissues showed that 83.2 +/- 7.4% and 76.4 +/- 2.1% of radioactivity was from intact [(18)F]FEBMP at 30 and 60 min, respectively, and that this ratio was higher than in plasma (8.6 +/- 1.9% and 3.9 +/- 1.1%, respectively).

We asked whether the structure and function of the BBB is disrupted differently in neonatal and adult rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. In adult rats, albumin leakage into injured regions was markedly increased during 2-24 h reperfusion but leakage remained low in the neonates. Functional assays employing intravascular tracers in the neonates showed that BBB permeability to both large (70 kDa dextran) and small (3 kDa dextran), gadolinium (III)-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid tracers remained largely undisturbed 24 h after reperfusion. The profoundly different functional integrity of the BBB was associated with the largely nonoverlapping patterns of regulated genes in endothelial cells purified from injured and uninjured adult and neonatal brain at 24 h (endothelial transcriptome, 31,042 total probe sets). Within significantly regulated 1266 probe sets in injured adults and 361 probe sets in neonates, changes in the gene expression of the basal lamina components, adhesion molecules, the tight junction protein occludin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were among the key differences. The protein expression of collagen-IV, laminin, claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens protein 1 was also better preserved in neonatal rats. Neutrophil infiltration remained low in acutely injured neonates but neutralization of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 in the systemic circulation enhanced neutrophil infiltration, BBB permeability, and injury.

However, endogenous choline and ACh have not been regarded as potent neuroprotective agents because physiological levels of choline/ACh do not produce neuroprotective levels of alpha7 activation. This limitation may be overcome by the use of type-II positive allosteric modulators (PAMs-II) of alpha7 nAChRs, such as 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-urea (PNU-120596). This proof-of-concept study presents a novel neuroprotective paradigm that converts endogenous choline/ACh into potent neuroprotective agents in cerebral ischaemia by inhibiting alpha7 nAChR desensitization using PNU-120596. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: An electrophysiological ex vivo cell injury assay (to quantify the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to acute injury by complete oxygen and glucose deprivation; COGD) and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischaemia were used in rats. KEY RESULTS: Choline (20-200 muM) in the presence, but not absence of 1 muM PNU-120596 significantly delayed anoxic depolarization/injury of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, but not CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons, subjected to COGD in acute hippocampal slices and these effects were blocked by 20 nM methyllycaconitine, a selective alpha7 antagonist, thus, activation of alpha7 nAChRs was required. PNU-120596 alone was ineffective ex vivo. In in vivo experiments, both pre- and post-ischaemia treatments with PNU-120596 (30 mg.kg(-1) , s.c. and 1 mg.kg(-1) , i.v., respectively) significantly reduced the cortical/subcortical infarct volume caused by transient focal cerebral ischaemia. PNU-120596 (1 mg.kg(-1) , i.v., 30 min post-ischaemia) remained neuroprotective in rats subjected to a choline-deficient diet for 14 days prior to experiments.

This study investigates the role of N-myc downstream-regulated gene-2 (NDRG2) in the neuroprotection of sevoflurane preconditioning in ischemic model both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: At 2 h after sevoflurane (2%) preconditioning for 1 h, rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 120 min. Neurobehavioral scores (n = 10), infarct volumes (n = 10), cellular apoptosis (n = 6), and NDRG2 expression (n = 6) were determined at 24 h after reperfusion. In vitro, cultural astrocytes were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 4 h. Cellular viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and NDRG2 expression (n = 6) were evaluated in the presence or absence of NDRG2-specific small interfering RNA or NDRG2 overexpression plasmid. RESULTS: Sevoflurane preconditioning decreased apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick-end labeling-positive cells reduced to 31.2 +/- 5.3% and cleaved Caspase-3 reduced to 1.42 +/- 0.21 fold) and inhibited NDRG2 expression (1.28 +/- 0.15 fold) and nuclear translocation (2.21 +/- 0.29 fold) in ischemic penumbra. Similar effects were observed in cultural astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation. NDRG2 knockdown by small interfering RNA attenuated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injury (cell viability increased to 80.5 +/- 4.1%; lactate dehydrogenase release reduced to 30.5 +/- 4.0%) and cellular apoptosis (cleaved Caspase-3 reduced to 1.55 +/- 0.21 fold; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick-end labeling-positive cells reduced to 18.2 +/- 4.3%), whereas NDRG2 overexpression reversed the protective effects of sevoflurane preconditioning.

We describe two complementary methods that enable targeted occlusion of any single blood vessel within the upper 500 microm of adult rodent neocortex. Our goal is to generate highly localized regions of ischemia by blocking penetrating arterioles and ascending venules, which are bottlenecks of flow in the cortical angioarchitecture. One method, termed photothrombosis, makes use of linear optical absorption by a photosensitizer, transiently circulated in the blood stream, to induce a clot in a surface or near-surface segment of a vessel. The second method, termed plasma-mediated ablation, makes use of nonlinear optical interactions, without the need to introduce an exogenous absorber, to induce clots in subsurface segments of penetrating vessels, as well as subsurface microvessels and capillaries. The choice of the method for occlusion of individual vessels depends on the location of the vessels being studied and the objectives of the study.

Cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and Marfan syndrome are two neurovascular disorders that affect smooth muscle cells through accumulation of granule and osmiophilic materials and defective elastic fiber formations respectively. Moyamoya disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II), and Fabry's disease are disorders that affect the endothelium cells of blood vessels through occlusion or abnormal development.

Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF) is a small heat-stable pentapeptide produced by Entamoeba histolytica in axenic culture, which is supposed to protect the brain from ischemic injury; the mechanism, however, remains unknown. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism underlying the protective role of MLIF in brain ischemia. METHODS: A middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats was used for detecting the effect of MLIF in the brain ischemia in vivo. To identify targets of MLIF in brain endothelial cells, we performed immunoprecipitation of biotin-conjugated MLIF and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MLIF can protect the brain from ischemic injury in vivo, yielding decreased ischemic volume, prolonged survival, and improved neurological outcome. In vitro studies showed that MLIF displayed protective effects through inhibition of expression of pathological inflammatory adhesion molecules and enhancing endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide release in the cerebrovascular endothelium. The target screening experiments demonstrated binding of MLIF to the ribosomal protein translation elongation factor eEF1A1. MLIF enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression through stabilization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA, and eEF1A1 was shown to be necessary for this enhanced expression. Knockdown of eEF1A1 or inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase attenuated MLIF-mediated inhibition of adhesion molecule expression. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a new potential pharmacologically targetable mechanism underlying MLIF's protective effects in brain ischemia through the eEF1A1/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway.",2012,Journal Article,Stroke,Y.

Sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1), an endogenous antioxidant protein, exhibits neuroprotective effects. Although the mechanism by which Srxn1 negatively regulates oxidative and apoptotic pathways has been extensively characterized, the impact of Srxn1 on inflammation has not been well studied. In this study, we used oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by recovery (OGD/R) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic stress from cerebral ischemic damage on primary cultured astrocytes. We found that knockdown of Srxn1 by two shRNAs resulted in decreased cell viability of astrocytes. Decreased level of Srxn1 also correlated with excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-alpha, MPO, IL-1beta, and IL-6. In addition, Srxn1 appeared to influence the strength of TLR4 signaling pathway; the expression of COX-2, IL-6, and NOS2 were strongly induced by OGD/R and H2O2 in astrocyte cultures with Srxn1-shRNAs. Our results suggested that loss of Srxn1 expression in astrocytes may cause excessive activation of inflammatory responses which contribute to OGD/R- and H2O2-induced cell death.

To date, both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated for pathogenesis of MMD. Allelic variations in RNF213 are known to confer the risk of MMD; however, functional roles of RNF213 remain to be largely elusive. We herein report that pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFNG and TNFA, synergistically activated transcription of RNF213 both in vitro and in vivo. Using various chemical inhibitors, we found that AKT and PKR pathways contributed to the transcriptional activation of RNF213. Transcriptome-wide analysis and subsequent validation with quantitative PCR supported that endogenous expression of cell cycle-promoting genes were significantly decreased with knockdown of RNF213 in cultured endothelial cells. Consistently, these cells showed less proliferative and less angiogenic profiles. Chemical inhibitors for AKT (LY294002) and PKR (C16) disrupted their angiogenic potentials, suggesting that RNF213 and its upstream pathways cooperatively organize the process of angiogenesis. Furthermore, RNF213 down-regulated expressions of matrix metalloproteases in endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts or other cell types.

Data following small-moderate stroke are limited. Therapeutic hypothermia improves outcome after cardiac arrest, is strongly neuroprotective in experimental stroke, and is under clinical trial in stroke. Hypothermia lowers elevated intracranial pressure; however, rebound intracranial pressure elevation and neurological deterioration may occur during rewarming. HYPOTHESES: (1) Intracranial pressure increases 24 h after moderate and small strokes. (2) Short-duration hypothermia-rewarming, instituted before intracranial pressure elevation, prevents this 24 h intracranial pressure elevation. METHODS: Long-Evans rats with two hour middle cerebral artery occlusion or outbred Wistar rats with three hour middle cerebral artery occlusion had intracranial pressure measured at baseline and 24 h. Wistars were randomized to 2.5 h hypothermia (32.5 degrees C) or normothermia, commencing 1 h after stroke. RESULTS: In Long-Evans rats (n = 5), intracranial pressure increased from 10.9 +/- 4.6 mmHg at baseline to 32.4 +/- 11.4 mmHg at 24 h, infarct volume was 84.3 +/- 15.9 mm(3) . In normothermic Wistars (n = 10), intracranial pressure increased from 6.7 +/- 2.3 mmHg to 31.6 +/- 9.3 mmHg, infarct volume was 31.3 +/- 18.4 mm(3) . In hypothermia-treated Wistars (n = 10), 24 h intracranial pressure did not increase (7.0 +/- 2.8 mmHg, P < 0.001 vs. normothermia), and infarct volume was smaller (15.4 +/- 11.8 mm(3) , P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We saw major intracranial pressure elevation 24 h after stroke in two rat strains, even after small strokes.

The results showed that CART was effective in reducing the neuronal apoptosis and expression of ER stress markers (GRP78, CHOP and cleaved caspase12), and increasing the BDNF expression in I/R injury rat cortex both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the effects of CART on ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis and ER stress were suppressed by tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) IgG, whereas the effects of CART on BDNF transcription, synthesis and secretion were abolished by CREB siRNA.

METHODS: Rats were subjected to 1 hour middle cerebral artery occlusion and a 2-hour reperfusion. During reperfusion, normal saline (n = 14) or dexmedetomidine 1 mug/kg/minute (n = 14) was infused intravenously. At 2 hours of reperfusion, regional cerebral blood flow using (14)C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography, microregional arterial and venous (20-60 mum in diameter) O2 saturation (SvO2) using cryomicrospectrophotometry, and the size of cortical infarction were determined. RESULTS: Ischemia-reperfusion decreased microregional SvO2 (52.9 +/- 3.7% vs. 61.1 +/- .6%, P < .005) with increased variation or heterogeneity (P < .0001) with similar regional cerebral blood flow and O2 consumption. Dexmedetomidine during reperfusion decreased the heterogeneity of SvO2 that was analyzed with an analysis of variance (P < .01) and reported as coefficient of variation (100 x standard deviation/Mean) (11.8 vs. 16.4). The number of veins with O2 saturation less than 50% decreased with dexmedetomidine (13/80 vs. 27/81, P < .01).

Primary cultured cortical neuronal cells subjected to combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were used as an in vitro recurrent ischemic model. RSV administration significantly reduced infarct volumes, improved behavioral deficits and protected neuronal cells from cell death in recurrent ischemic stroke models in vivo and in vitro. RSV treatments significantly increased the intracellular NAD(+) /NADH ratio, AMPK and SIRT1 activities, decreased energy assumption and restored cell energy ATP level. SIRT1 and AMPK inhibitors and specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) for SIRT1 and AMPK significantly abrogated the neuroprotection induced by RSV. AMPK-siRNA and inhibitor decreased SIRT1 activities; however, SIRT1-siRNA and inhibitor had no impact on phospho-AMPK (p-AMPK) levels.

Microparticles (MPs) are small vesicles released from cells upon apoptosis or activation. Microparticles are present in blood of healthy individuals. Studies showing a modification of their concentrations in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and after cardiovascular events identify MPs as potential biomarkers of disease. Moreover, the pathophysiological properties of MPs may contribute to atherosclerosis development. In addition, pharmacological compounds, used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, can reduce plasma MP concentrations. Nevertheless, numerous issues remain to be solved before MP measurement can be applied as routine biological tests to improve cardiovascular risk prediction.

Group 3 included 3 subgroups, related to testing the model in various experimental conditions: The neck was clipped in 3 animals; venous pouches lacked an endothelial lining in 4 animals; and 7 were control animals. Animals were followed until rupture, or for 1-4 weeks. Angiography was performed postoperatively and before euthanasia. We studied lesion pathology, paying attention to thrombosis, recanalization, wall composition, and perianeurysmal hemorrhage. RESULTS: Groups differed significantly in aneurysm dimensions and aspect ratio (P = .002). Ruptures occurred more frequently in animals with untreated giant aneurysms (7/7) than in animals with small wide-neck (0/6) or small-neck (2/4) aneurysms (P = .002). Ruptures occurred only in animals with thrombosed aneurysms. Lesions lacking an endothelial lining and 5 of 6 clipped venous pouches thrombosed but did not rupture.

To determine whether aging exacerbates hypertension-induced CMHs young (3 months) and aged (24 months) mice were treated with angiotensin II plus L-NAME. We found that the same level of hypertension leads to significantly earlier onset and increased incidence of CMHs in aged mice than in young mice, as shown by neurological examination, gait analysis, and histological assessment of CMHs in serial brain sections. Hypertension-induced cerebrovascular oxidative stress and redox-sensitive activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were increased in aging. Treatment of aged mice with resveratrol significantly attenuated hypertension-induced oxidative stress, inhibited vascular MMP activation, significantly delayed the onset, and reduced the incidence of CMHs.

Platinum coils are prone to compaction, and currently used liquid embolics are delivered with angiotoxic agents. This work presents initial in vivo studies of a novel liquid-to-solid gelling polymer system (PPODA-QT), focusing on biocompatibility and effective delivery strategies. METHODS: PPODA-QT was used to embolize surgically created lateral wall carotid artery aneurysms in swine using three delivery strategies. Group 1 aneurysms were completely filled with PPODA-QT (n = 5), group 2 aneurysms were subcompletely (80%-90%) filled (n = 3), and group 3 aneurysms underwent three-dimensional coil placement followed by polymer embolization (n = 3). The study was designed such that three animals per treatment group survived to 1 month. RESULTS: The group 1 delivery strategy (100% filling) resulted in survival of 3/5 animals. This strategy led to aneurysm stretching, which resulted model failure in 2/5 animals. Group 2 aneurysms, although initially <100% filled with the polymer, displayed robust neointimal tissue coverage and complete obliteration after 1 month. Group 3 aneurysms showed less prominent neointimal tissue coverage as well as two instances where excess polymer was found in the parent vessel. The PPODA-QT material showed good biocompatibility with vascular tissue in all animals at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: This small-scale pilot study highlighted first-time in vivo use of PPODA-QT as an embolic agent for aneurysm treatment. Filling aneurysms to 80% to 90% capacity proved to be a safe and effective delivery strategy, and PPODA-QT showed excellent biocompatibility.

This new technique combines immediate flow restoration after stent deployment with high recanalization rates. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of the new Aperio clot-removal device was tested in comparison with the Solitaire AB device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiments were performed in swine with a weight of 35-50 kg following established models. The experimental thrombi were prepared by using a new flow model (Thrombus Loop) to produce radiopaque thrombi. Thrombi were cut into lengths of 10 mm and injected into the target vessel. The occlusion was verified by DSA and rated with the help of the TICI score. A microcatheter was placed distal to the thrombus. The devices were placed with the proximal third within the thrombus and were retrieved under continuous aspiration in their released state into the guiding sheath. We performed 23 procedures with the Aperio device and 18 procedures with the Solitaire AB and FR devices. Control angiograms were obtained 3 and 5 minutes after device deployment to evaluate the flow restoration. The number of attempts to reach a TICI 2/3 score was recorded as well as the time to recanalization and the device-related complications. Vasospasm, vascular perforation, intramural arterial dissection, or embolization of a previously uninvolved territory was defined as a device-related complication. RESULTS: Defined radiopaque thrombi from whole blood could reliably be created by using the Thrombus Loop. Both devices demonstrated a high recanalization rate of 100% (TICI 3) in the target vessel with no device-related complications. No significant differences were found between the 2 devices. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, we could show that radiopaque thrombi of whole blood with a defined diameter could be reliably created by using the Thrombus Loop.

From the results of Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we obtained a significant up-regulation of CHMP4B in neurons adjacent to the hematoma following ICH. Increasing CHMP4B level was found to be accompanied by the up-regulation of Fas receptor (Fas), Fas ligand (FasL), active caspase-8, and active caspase-3. Besides, CHMP4B co-localized well with Fas and active caspase-3 in neurons, indicating its potential role in neuronal apoptosis. What's more, our in vitro study, using CHMP4B RNA interference in PC12 cells, further confirmed that CHMP4B might exert its pro-apoptotic function on neuronal apoptosis through extrinsic pathway.

Infection of susceptible mouse-strains with this parasite strain results in the induction of experimental cerebral malaria, a neurologic syndrome that recapitulates certain important aspects of Plasmodium falciparum-mediated severe malaria in humans. Mature forms of blood-stage malaria express parasitic proteins on the surface of the infected erythrocyte, which allows them to bind to vascular endothelial cells. This process induces obstructions in blood flow, resulting in hypoxia and haemorrhages and also stimulates the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the site of parasite sequestration. Unlike other infections, i.e neutrotopic viruses, both malaria-parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) as well as associated inflammatory leukocytes remain sequestered within blood vessels rather than infiltrating the brain parenchyma. Thus to avoid contamination of sequestered leukocytes with non-inflammatory circulating cells, extensive intracardial perfusion of infected-mice prior to organ extraction and tissue processing is required in this procedure to remove the blood compartment. After perfusion, brains are harvested and dissected in small pieces. The tissue structure is further disrupted by enzymatic treatment with Collagenase D and DNAse I. The resulting brain homogenate is then centrifuged on a Percoll gradient that allows separation of brain-sequestered leukocytes (BSL) from myelin and other tissue debris. Isolated cells are then washed, counted using a hemocytometer and stained with fluorescent antibodies for subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. This procedure allows comprehensive phenotypic characterization of inflammatory leukocytes migrating to the brain in response to various stimuli, including stroke as well as viral or parasitic infections.

For treatment, the first action is to restore CBF by thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Although rt-PA benefits clinical outcome, its application is limited by short therapeutic time window and risk of brain hemorrhage. Different to thrombolytic agents, neuroprotectants reduce neurological injuries by blocking ischemic cascade events such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Nano-neuroprotectants demonstrate higher therapeutic effect than small molecular analogues due to their prolonged circulation lifetime and disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic region. Even enhanced BBB permeability in ischemic territories is verified, the pore size of ischemic vasculatures determining how large and how efficient the therapeutics can pass is barely studied. In this work, nanoprobes (NPs) with different diameters are developed. In vivo multimodal imaging indicates that NP uptakes in ischemic region depended on their diameters and the pore size upper limit of ischemic vasculatures is determined as 10-11 nm. Additionally, penumbra defined as salvageable ischemic tissues performed a higher BBB permeability than infarct core.

The capability of volumetric scanning and a high resolution in time and space enables whole organ perfusion studies. We aimed to assess feasibility and validity of fpVCT in cerebral perfusion measurement with impaired hemodynamics by evaluation of three well-established rat stroke models for temporary and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to temporary (group I: suture model) and permanent (group II: suture model; III: macrosphere model) MCAO and to a control group. Perfusion scans with respect to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV) were performed 24h post intervention by fpVCT, using a Gantry rotation time of 1s and a total scanning time of 30s. Postmortem analysis included infarct-size calculation by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Infarct volumes did not differ significantly throughout intervention groups. After permanent MCAO, CBF significantly decreased in subcortical regions to 78.2% (group II, p=0.005) and 79.9% (group III, p=0.012) and in total hemisphere to 77.4% (group II, p=0.010) and 82.0% (group III, p=0.049). CBF was less impaired with temporary vessel occlusion. CBV measurement revealed no significant differences. Results demonstrate feasibility of cerebral perfusion quantification in rats with the fpVCT, which can be a useful tool for non-invasive dynamic imaging of cerebral perfusion in rodent stroke models.

Linked to autosomal dominant mutations in diverse genes that encode cell-surface receptors (i.e., amyloid precursor protein in CAA and NOTCH3 in CADASIL), both diseases are associated with accumulation of abnormal material around cerebral vessels, such as amyloid in CAA or granular osmiophilic material in CADASIL. Both CAA and CADASIL share clinical features of white matter degeneration and infarcts, and vascular dementia in the human adult; microbleeds occur in both CADASIL and CAA, but large intracerebral hemorrhages are more characteristic for the latter. While the mechanisms are poorly understood, wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and eventual loss of vascular smooth muscle cells are overlapping pathologies involving leptomeningeal, and pial or penetrating small arteries and arterioles in CAA and CADASIL. Dysregulation of cerebral blood flow and eventual hypoperfusion are believed to be the key pathophysiological steps in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Although animal models expressing CAA or CADASIL mutations have partially reproduced the human pathology, there has been marked heterogeneity in the phenotypic spectrum, possibly due to genetic background differences among mouse models, and obvious species differences between mouse and man.

In the present work, the model neurotrophin is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and the model anti-inflammatory agent is the type II tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) decoy receptor. Both the GDNF and the TNFR are large molecules that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is intact in the early hours after stroke when neural rescue is still possible. The GDNF and the TNFR decoy receptor were re-engineered for BBB transport as IgG fusion proteins, wherein the GDNF or the TNFR are fused to the heavy chain of a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the mouse transferrin receptor (TfR), and these fusion proteins are designated cTfRMAb-GDNF and cTfRMAb-TNFR, respectively. Mice were treated intravenously with (a) saline, (b) GDNF alone, (c) the cTfRMAb-GDNF fusion protein alone, or (d) the combined cTfRMAb-GDNF and cTfRMAb-TNFR fusion proteins, following a 1-h reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).

Few animal models have been developed to study this problem. The objectives of this study were to evaluate different modalities of pain in a central neuropathic pain rat model and to assess the effects of ketamine administered at different doses. Animals were evaluated on the rotarod, Hargreaves, Von Frey and acetone tests. A very small hemorrhage was created by injecting a collagenase solution in the right ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus. Following the establishment of the neuropathy, ketamine was evaluated as a therapeutic drug for this condition. RESULTS: Histopathological observations showed a well localized lesion with neuronal necrosis and astrocytosis following the collagenase injection that was localized within the VPL. No significant change in motor coordination was observed following surgery in either the saline or collagensae groups. In the collagenase group, a significant decrease in mechanical allodynia threshold was observed. A sporadic and transient cold allodynia was also noted. No thermal hyperalgesia was seen following the collagenase injection. Ketamine was then tested as a potential therapeutic drug. A significant decrease in motor coordination was seen only following the administration of 25 mg/kg of ketamine in both groups. An alleviation of mechanical allodynia was achieved only with the high ketamine dose. The minimal effective ketamine serum concentration (150 ng/mL) was only achieved in animals that received 25 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: An intrathalamic hemorrhage induced a bilateral mechanical allodynia in rats. Cold hyperalgesia was observed in 60% of these animals.

One hundred and fifty six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham, MCAO, MCAO+control siRNA, MCAO+TMEM166 siRNA. Outcomes were measured including mortality rate, brain edema, BBB disruption, and neurobehavioral testing. Western blotting techniques measured the expression of key pro-autophagic and apoptotic proteins such as TMEM166, Beclin-1, cleaved casepase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax. The study found that TMEM166 siRNA treatment significantly reduced the mortality rate, cerebral edema, neurobehavioral deficits, and BBB disruption as measured by Evan's blue assay following MCAO injury. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting analysis demonstrated an increased expressions of TMEM166, Beclin-1, LC3, cleaved casepase-3 and Bcl-2/Bax in the infarcted areas. This study suggests that TMEM166 induces autophagy and apoptosis may in fact play a significant role in cell death following MCAO injury and its mediation may be through the crosstalk of Bcl-2.

Mice, displaying PCs of ~1000 platelets/nL, are widely used to assess platelet function in (patho-)physiology, but also in this species, the significance of PC for hemostasis and thrombotic disease is not established. We reduced PCs in mice to defined ranges between 0 and 1000 platelets/nL by platelet-depleting antibodies and challenged them in different arterial thrombosis models: the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) stroke model and tail bleeding experiments. We show that thrombotic occlusion of the injured aorta and the carotid artery were partially impaired when PCs were reduced by 70% or 80%, respectively. In contrast, tail bleeding times and thrombus formation in small arterioles were largely unaffected by reductions of PC up to 97.5%. Similarly, infarct growth and neurological deficits after tMCAO were unaffected by reductions of PCs up to 90%, whereas a further reduction was protective.

The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of an antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel) on the process of laser-induced thrombus formation in mice using intravital fluorescence microscopy. C57 BL/6J mice (n = 19) were anesthetized using chloral hydrate. The head of each mouse was fixed with a head holder, and a cranial window was made in the parietal region. Platelets were labeled in vivo by intravenous administration of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester. Clopidogrel (1 mg/kg, n = 6; 10 mg/kg, n = 6) was administered orally for 2 days before the experiment. Another seven mice were used as controls. Laser irradiation (1,000 mA, 9.8 mW, diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser 532 nm) was directed for 4 s at pial arteries to induce thrombus formation. Labeled platelets and thrombus were observed continuously under fluorescence microscopy. We recorded the area of thrombus after 30 min and determined the complete occlusion rate. After laser irradiation to the pial artery, complete occlusion rate was significantly lower in the clopidogrel (10 mg/kg) group (16%, 4/25 vessels) than in the control group (60%, 12/20 vessels) or clopidogrel (1 mg/kg) group (55%, 11/20 vessels).

Previously, we reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of the long-pentraxin family, following HI injury in neonatal brain. Here, we report that genetic deletion of NP1 expression prevents HI injury in neonatal brain. Elevated expression of NP1 was observed in neurons, not in astrocytes, of the ipsilateral cortical layers (I-IV) and in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas of WT brains following hypoxia-ischemia; brain areas that developed infarcts (at 24-48 h), showed significantly increased numbers of TUNEL-(+) cells and tissue loss (at 7 days). In contrast, NP1-KO mice showed no evidence of brain infarction and tissue loss after HI. The immunofluorescence staining of brain sections with mitochondrial protein COX IV and subcellular fractionation analysis showed increased accumulation of NP1 in mitochondria, pro-death protein Bax activation and NP1 co-localization with activated caspase-3 in WT, but not in the NP1-KO brains; corroborating NP1 interactions with the mitochondria-derived pro-death pathways. Disruption of NP1 translocation to mitochondria by NP1-siRNA in primary cortical cultures significantly reduced ischemic neuronal death. NP1 was immunoprecipitated with activated Bax [6A7] proteins; HI caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bax, thereby, facilitating Bax translocation to mitochondrial and neuronal death. To further delineate the specificity of NPs, we found that NP1 but not the NP2 induction is specifically involved in brain injury mechanisms and that knockdown of NP1 only results in neuroprotection. Furthermore, live in vivo T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping showed no sign of delayed brain injury or tissue loss in the NP1-KO mice as compared to the WT at different post-HI periods (4-24 weeks) examined; indicating a long-term neuroprotective efficacy of NP1 gene deletion.

In particular, a recently developed, cell permeable lanthionine derivative known as LKE (lanthionine ketimine 5-ethyl ester) promotes neurite growth at low nanomolar concentrations. LKE also has neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its therapeutic potential in cerebral ischemia and its mechanisms of neurotrophic action remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective actions of LKE could result from induction or modulation of CRMP2. We found that treating primary cultured mouse neurons with LKE provided significant protection against t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced neuronal death possibly through CRMP2 upregulation. Similarly, in vivo studies showed that LKE pre and/or post-treatment protects mice against permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (p-MCAO) as evidenced by lower stroke lesions and improved functional outcomes in terms of rotarod, grip strength and neurologic deficit scores in treated groups. Protein expression levels of CRMP2 were higher in brain cortices of LKE pretreated mice, suggesting that LKE's neuroprotective activity may be CRMP2 dependent. Lower activity of cleaved PARP-1 and higher activity of SIRT-1 was also observed in LKE treated group suggesting its anti-apoptotic properties.

Aging predicts worse outcome from stroke; yet, the impact of age on SD evolution is not clear. Cerebral ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in young (8-9 weeks old, n = 8) and old (2 year olds, n = 6) anesthetized rats. Sham-operated animals of both age groups served as control (n = 12). Electrocorticogram, direct current potential, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) variations were acquired via a small craniotomy above the parietal cortex. SDs were elicited by KCl through a second craniotomy distal to the recording site. Ischemia and age delayed the recovery from SD. CBF decreased progressively during ischemia in the old animals selectively, and inverse neurovascular coupling with SD evolved in the old but not in the young ischemic group. We propose that (mal)adaptation of cerebrovascular function with aging impairs the SD-related CBF response, which is implicated in the intensified expansion of ischemic damage in the old brain.",2015,Journal Article,Neurobiol Aging,A.

Formation of a glial scar can block the neuronal outgrowth that is required for restoration of damaged tissue. Therefore, regulation of astrocyte activation is important; however, the mediator of this process has not been fully elucidated. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is an early responder to oxidative stress, and plays a pivotal role in the intracellular signalling pathway of apoptosis, inflammation, and differentiation. To confirm whether ASK1 mediates astrocyte activation and leads to glial scar formation after cerebral ischaemia, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, and astrocyte cultures were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation. After silencing of ASK1 , astrocyte-associated genes were downregulated, as seen with the use of microarrays. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level was decreased, and correlated with the reduction in the ASK1 level. In astrocytes, reduction in the ASK1 level decreased the activity of the p38 pathway, and the levels of transcription factors for GFAP and GFAP transcripts after hypoxia. In the chronic phase, ASK1 depletion reduced glial scar formation and conserved neuronal structure, which may lead to better functional recovery. These data suggest that ASK1 may be an important mediator of ischaemia-induced astrocyte activation and scar formation, and could provide a potential therapeutic target for treatment after ischaemic stroke.",2016,Journal Article,Eur J Neurosci,S.

They are thought to be involved in the trafficking and hence processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, APP. In this study we set out to obtain in vivo confirmation of a link between flotillins and cleavage of APP to release amyloidogenic Abeta peptide, and to generate tools that would allow us to ask whether flotillins are functionally redundant. We used a mouse model for Abeta-dependent cerebral amyloidosis, APPPS1 mice, combined with deletion of either flotillin 1 singly, or flotillin 1 and flotillin 2 together. There was a small but significant reduction in Abeta levels, and the abundance of congo-red stained plaques, in brains of 12 week old mice lacking flotillin 1. A similar reduction in Abeta levels was observed in the flotillin 1-/-, flotillin 2-/- double knockouts. We did not observe large effects on the clustering or endocytosis of APP in flotillin 1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We conclude that flotillins are likely to play some role in APP trafficking or processing, but the relevant cellular mechanisms require more investigation.

However, treatment options to date are very limited. To meet the need for validating the novel therapeutic approaches and understanding the physiopathology of the ischemic brain injury, experimental stroke models were critical for preclinical research. However, commonly used embolic stroke models are reluctant to mimic the clinical situation and not suitable for thrombolytic timing studies. In this paper, we established a standard method for producing a rat embolic stroke model with autologous thrombus formed within the common carotid artery (CCA) by constant galvanic stimulation. Then the thrombus was shattered and channeled into the origin of the MCA and small (lacunar) artery. To identify the success of MCA occlusion, regional cerebral blood flow was monitored, neurological deficits and infarct volumes were measured at 2, 4 and 6h postischemia. This model developed a predictable infarct volume (38.37 +/- 2.88%) and gradually reduced blood flow (20% of preischemic baselines) within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The thrombus occluded in the MCA was able to be lysed by a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) within 4h postischemia.

To date, no study has examined the role of T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) in IPostC-afforded neuroprotection. We explored the molecular mechanism related with TOPK in antioxidant effect of IPostC against ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS: Focal ischemia was induced in rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Reactive oxygen species production in the peri-infarct cortex was detected using dihydroethidium. Malondialdehyde, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and 3-nitrotyrosine, as a marker of protein oxidation, were detected by ELISA. The expression or location of antioxidant proteins and signal molecules TOPK, phosphatase, and tensin homolog, and Akt was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Our results revealed that IPostC relieved transient middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced oxidative damage by reducing reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation in the peri-infarct cortex and raised levels of antioxidants perioxiredoxin-1, peroxiredoxin-2, and thioredoxin-1. In addition, IPostC increased p-AKT and p-TOPK levels, which colocalized in neural cells. In vitro TOPK knockdown by small interfering RNA decreased the levels of antioxidants peroxiredoxin-1, thioredoxin, and manganese superoxide dismutase activity in PC12 cells. In vivo intracerebroventricular injection of TOPK small interfering RNA reversed IPostC-induced neuroprotection by increasing infarct volume and nitric oxide content and reducing manganese superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, IPostC-evoked Akt activation was blocked by TOPK small interfering RNA in vivo, but the decreased phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog level in ischemia/reperfusion was not influenced by IPostC or by TOPK small interfering RNA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antioxidative effects of TOPK/Akt might contribute to the neuroprotection of IPostC treatment against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.",2014,Journal Article,Stroke,H.

C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) orchestrates apoptosis in a variety of cell types in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, implicated in the brain injury after SAH. However, the role of CHOP in the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after SAH remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CHOP silencing on endothelial apoptosis and CVS following subarachnoid hemorrhage in the rat. The study was conducted on 65 rats and employed endovascular perforation model of SAH. CHOP siRNAs were injected 24 h prior to the hemorrhage. At 72 h after SAH brains with basilar arteries (BA) were collected from euthanized rats for laboratory investigations. Triple fluorescence stain revealed expression of CHOP in cerebral vascular endothelia after SAH. Marked reduction of CHOP protein and the reduction of its downstream signaling effectors, bim and caspase-3, were found in BA with Western blot analysis. CHOP silencing reduced number of apoptotic endothelial cells in BA, and increased BA diameter after SAH. The amelioration of CVS was associated with reduced neuronal injury in cerebral tissues.

AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS: Our goal was to study the reproducibility of outcomes obtained in five rat models of middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation in order to identify the optimal model for the preclinical studies. METHODS: In Part 1 of the experiments, systolic blood flow velocity (sBFV) and cerebral area at risk (AR) were determined immediately after the onset of brain ischemia induced in different ways in Wistar rats. After that, another set of experiments was performed (Part 2 of the experiments), now aimed at the assessment of the delayed outcome of five different models of cerebral ischemia designated as Versions 1-5. The versions were: Version 1 - 40-minute left MCA (LMCA) occlusion with reperfusion; Version 2 - permanent LMCA ligation; Version 3 - permanent ligation of both LMCA and left common carotid artery (CCA); Version 4 - permanent LMCA and bilateral CCA (bCCA) ligation; Version 5 - permanent LMCA ligation and 40-minute bCCA occlusion. The infarct size (IS) was quantified using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The severity of neurological deficit was assessed by the Garcia score. The extent of brain edema was determined by calculating the difference in volumes of affected and contralateral hemispheres. RESULTS: Within a relatively big AR, Versions 1 and 2 resulted in a small IS [0.2 (0.0; 0.4)% and 0.3 (0.0; 0.7)%, respectively, P > 0.05]. Unlike that and comparable with AR, Version 3 resulted in a greater, albeit more variable IS [5.9 (2.1; 8.3)%, P < 0.0001 vs. Version 2]. Also comparable with AR, Versions 4 and 5 produced greatest values of IS [14.5 (11.4; 17.9)% and 11.3 (10.1; 14.2)%, respectively]; this parameter was most reproducible in Version 5. A significant decrease in neurological deficit score was found in Versions 4 and 5. Again, the reproducibility of the data on neurological outcome was higher in Version 5 versus Version 4.

We here investigated the combination of two imaging modalities in the chronic phase after cerebral ischemia: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using intravenously applied ultra small supraparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer [(11)C]PK11195. METHODS: Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) by the macrosphere model and monitored by MRI and PET for 28 or 56 days, followed by immunohistochemical endpoint analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing USPIO-MRI data in the chronic phase up to 8 weeks after stroke. RESULTS: Phagocytes with internalized USPIOs induced MRI-T2( *) signal alterations in the brain. Combined analysis with [(11)C]PK11195-PET allowed quantification of phagocytic activity and other neuroinflammatory processes. From 4 weeks after induction of ischemia, inflammation was dominated by phagocytes. Immunohistochemistry revealed colocalization of Iba1+ microglia with [(11)C]PK11195 and ED1/CD68 with USPIOs. USPIO-related iron was distinguished from alternatively deposited iron by assessing MRI before and after USPIO application. Tissue affected by non-phagocytic inflammation during the first week mostly remained in a viably vital but remodeled state after 4 or 8 weeks, while phagocytic activity was associated with severe injury and necrosis accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combined approach of USPIO-MRI and [(11)C]PK11195-PET allows to observe post-stroke inflammatory processes in the living animal in an intraindividual and longitudinal fashion, predicting long-term tissue fate.

To model ischemia-like conditions in vitro, primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Treatment of AKBA significantly reduced infarct volumes and apoptotic cells, and also increased neurologic scores by elevating the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain tissues in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats at 48 hours post reperfusion. In primary cultured neurons, AKBA increased the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against OGD-induced oxidative insult. Additionally, AKBA treatment increased Nrf2 binding activity to antioxidant-response elements (ARE). The protective effect of AKBA was attenuated by knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1.

To improve the translation of treatment efficacy from bench to bedside, we have performed a preclinical randomized controlled multicenter trial (pRCT) to test a potential stroke therapy under circumstances closer to the design and rigor of a clinical randomized control trial. Anti-CD49d antibodies, which inhibit the migration of leukocytes into the brain, were previously investigated in experimental stroke models by individual laboratories. Despite the conflicting results from four positive and one inconclusive preclinical studies, a clinical trial was initiated. To confirm the preclinical results and to test the feasibility of conducting a pRCT, six independent European research centers investigated the efficacy of anti-CD49d antibodies in two distinct mouse models of stroke in a centrally coordinated, randomized, and blinded approach. The results pooled from all research centers revealed that treatment with CD49d-specific antibodies significantly reduced both leukocyte invasion and infarct volume after the permanent distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, which causes a small cortical infarction. In contrast, anti-CD49d treatment did not reduce lesion size or affect leukocyte invasion after transient proximal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, which induces large lesions. These results suggest that the benefits of immune-targeted approaches may depend on infarct severity and localization.

Here, we have investigated the interrelationship between stress-responsive heme oxygenase (HO)-1 isoenzyme and TLR4 during chronic brain hypoperfusion. The right unilateral common carotid artery occlusion was performed by ligation of the right common carotid artery in C57BL/6J mice. The brain cortex or hippocampus was removed for western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence analysis. The link between HO-1 and TLR4 was further examined by silencing TLR4 and pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 in primary cultured cortical neurons. Cognitive dysfunction and decrease in cerebral blood flow in mice were observed 4 weeks after the occlusion. Our data further show that common carotid artery occlusion induced an increase in TLR4 and HO-1 protein levels. Although the administration of CoPP (10 mg/kg), HO-1 agonist, improved the cognitive dysfunction in a mice model of occlusion, western blot analysis in primary cultured cortical neurons showed that HO-1 was upregulated after lipopolysaccharide treatment; this was partially abolished by the TLR4 siRNA interference. The flow cytometry analysis showed that pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 by ZnPP (100 muM) further exaggerated lipopolysaccharide-induced neuronal cell death. Hence, stress-responsive HO-1 isoenzyme participates in TLR4-induced inflammation during chronic brain ischemia.

NKCC1 is a secondary active transporter, mainly localized in astrocytes, driven by transmembrane Na+/K+ gradients generated by the Na+,K+-ATPase. The astrocytic Na+,K+-ATPase is stimulated by small increases in extracellular K+ concentration and by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Larger K+ increases, as occurring during ischemia, also stimulate NKCC1, creating cell swelling. This study showed no edema after 3 hr medial cerebral artery occlusion but pronounced edema after 8 hr reperfusion. The edema was abolished by inhibitors of specifically beta1-adrenergic pathways, indicating failure of K+-mediated, but not beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated, stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 transport during reoxygenation. Ninety percent reduction of extracellular Ca2+ concentration occurs in ischemia. Ca2+ omission abolished K+ uptake in normoxic cultures of astrocytes after addition of 5 mM KCl. A large decrease in ouabain potency on K+ uptake in cultured astrocytes was also demonstrated in Ca2+-depleted media, and endogenous ouabains are needed for astrocytic K+ uptake. Thus, among the ionic changes induced by ischemia, the decrease in extracellular Ca2+ causes failure of the high-K+-stimulated Na+,K+-ATPase/NKCC1 ion/water uptake, making beta1-adrenergic activation the only stimulus and its inhibition effective against edema.",2014,Journal Article,Biomed Res Int,D.

CAA contributes to injuries of the neurovasculature including lobar hemorrhages, cortical microbleeds, ischemia, and superficial hemosiderosis. We postulate that CAA pathology is partially due to Abeta compromising the BBB. METHODS: We characterized 19 patients with acute stroke with ""probable CAA"" for neurovascular pathology based on MRI and clinical findings. Also, we studied the effect of Abeta on the expression of tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in isolated rat brain microvessels. RESULTS: Two of 19 patients with CAA had asymptomatic BBB leakage and posterior reversible encephalopathic syndrome indicating increased BBB permeability. In addition to white matter changes, diffusion abnormality suggesting lacunar ischemia was found in 4 of 19 patients with CAA; superficial hemosiderosis was observed in 7 of 9 patients. Abeta(40) decreased expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5 and increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Analysis of brain microvessels from transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein revealed the same expression pattern for tight junction and MMP proteins. Consistent with reduced tight junction and increased MMP expression and activity, permeability was increased in brain microvessels from human amyloid precursor protein mice compared with microvessels from wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Abeta contributes to changes in brain microvessel tight junction and MMP expression, which compromises BBB integrity. We conclude that Abeta causes BBB leakage and that assessing BBB permeability could potentially help characterize CAA progression and be a surrogate marker for treatment response.",2012,Journal Article,Stroke,A.

This size range is large enough to allow diffusion of signaling molecules, nutrients, and metabolic waste products, but too small to allow efficient penetration of most particulate drug delivery systems and viruses carrying therapeutic genes, thereby limiting effectiveness of many potential therapies. We analyzed the movements of nanoparticles of various diameters and surface coatings within fresh human and rat brain tissue ex vivo and mouse brain in vivo. Nanoparticles as large as 114 nm in diameter diffused within the human and rat brain, but only if they were densely coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Using these minimally adhesive PEG-coated particles, we estimated that human brain tissue ECS has some pores larger than 200 nm and that more than one-quarter of all pores are >/= 100 nm. These findings were confirmed in vivo in mice, where 40- and 100-nm, but not 200-nm, nanoparticles spread rapidly within brain tissue, only if densely coated with PEG. Similar results were observed in rat brain tissue with paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles of similar size (85 nm) and surface properties. The ability to achieve brain penetration with larger nanoparticles is expected to allow more uniform, longer-lasting, and effective delivery of drugs within the brain, and may find use in the treatment of brain tumors, stroke, neuroinflammation, and other brain diseases where the blood-brain barrier is compromised or where local delivery strategies are feasible.",2012,Journal Article,Sci Transl Med,E.

A possible method of overcoming these limitations is stimulation of thrombosis by using vascular targeting. Using an animal model of AVM, the authors examined the durability of the thrombosis induced by the vascular-targeting agents lipopolysaccharide and soluble tissue factor conjugate (LPS/sTF). METHODS: Stereotactic radiosurgery or sham radiation was administered to 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats serving as an animal model of AVM; 24 hours after this intervention, the rats received an intravenous injection of LPS/sTF or normal saline. The animals were killed at 1, 7, 30, or 90 days after treatment. Immediately beforehand, angiography was performed, and model AVM tissue was harvested for histological analysis to assess rates of vessel thrombosis. RESULTS: Among rats that received radiosurgery and LPS/sTF, induced thrombosis occurred in 58% of small AVM vessels; among those that received radiosurgery and saline, thrombosis occurred in 12% of small AVM vessels (diameter < 200 mum); and among those that received LPS/sTF but no radiosurgery, thrombosis occurred at an intermediate rate of 43%. No systemic toxicity or intravascular thrombosis remote from the target region was detected in any of the animals. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular targeting can increase intravascular thrombosis after radiosurgery, and the vessel occlusion is durable. Further work is needed to refine this approach to AVM treatment, which shows promise as a way to overcome the limitations of radiosurgery.",2014,Journal Article,J Neurosurg,R.

NEW METHOD: We investigated the dynamic recovery of infarct regions in ischemia-injured brains using indocyanine green (ICG), which is inexpensive and readily available. This dye was used to visualize blood vessels and infarct area, and to measure blood flow after a photothrombotic ischemic operation (PIO). Mice were injected with ICG via the tail vein, and a time-series of fluorescence signal images was acquired before and after PIO. We then applied color codes to arteries and veins in the images and analyzed ICG intensity and dynamics. RESULTS: These time-series stacked images showed changes in pial vessel morphology after PIO. Further, a map of maximum fluorescence intensity showed an infarct in the dorsal cortical region. Changes in the blood flow index and mean transit time were also observed in the infarct region after PIO. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Our application of ICG imaging provided a range of information on PIO-induced infarcts in mice with relative ease and in a cost-effective manner.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if small synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides with different degrees of sulfation (methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-O-sulfo-alpha-d-glucopyranoside, sodium salt (di0S), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-6-di-O-sulfo-alpha-d-glucopyranoside, disodium salt (di6S) and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-alpha-d-glucopyranoside, trisodium salt (di4,6S)) could improve cell survival in in vitro and in vivo brain ischemia-related models. Rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation and a photothrombotic stroke model in mice were used. The three hyaluran disaccharides, incubated during the oxygen and glucose deprivation (15min) and re-oxygenation periods (120min), reduced cell death of hippocampal slices measured as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, being the most potent di4,6S; in contrast, high molecular hyaluronan was ineffective. The protective actions of di4,6S against oxygen and glucose deprivation were related to activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, reduction of p65 translocation to the nucleus, inhibition of inducible nitric oxide oxidase induction and reactive oxygen species production, and to an increase in glutathione levels. Administered 1h post-stroke, di4,6S reduced cerebral infarct size and improved motor activity in the beam walk test. In conclusion, di4,6S affords neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic neuronal damage. Our results suggest that its neuroprotective effect could be exerted through its capability to reduce oxidative stress during ischemia. Its small molecular size makes it a more potential druggable drug to target the brain as compared with its HMW parent compound hyaluronan.",2014,Journal Article,Neuroscience,J.

We tested the hypothesis that pyruvate protects the brain against ischemia-reperfusion injury by inducing endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) expression. METHODS: Pyruvate's protective effect was evaluated in C6 glioma cells and HT22 neuronal cells subjected to transient oxygen glucose deprivation. Cell viability (calcein AM assay) and expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, EPO, Akt and Erk (immunoblot), and EPO receptor (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were analyzed. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats was induced by 2 hours middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24 hours reperfusion. Pyruvate or saline was infused from 60 minutes occlusion until 30 minutes reperfusion. Lesion volume and DNA fragmentation were assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay, respectively. Immunoblots were conducted to determine cerebral EPO contents. RESULTS: Pyruvate increased cell viability, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, EPO, and Akt phosphorylation. Small interfering RNA suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and EPO abolished pyruvate-induced cytoprotection. In the rat stroke model, pyruvate reduced lesion volume by 84% and DNA fragmentation by 77% versus controls; increased EPO content paralleled these cerebroprotective actions of pyruvate.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated inflammation may be involved in the white matter damage with oligodendrocyte (Ol) death. Therefore, we used spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats to study the role of neuroinflammation in white matter damage. METHODS: Permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion was performed at 12 weeks of age in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats. Following surgery, rats were placed on a Japanese permissive diet and received 1% NaCl in drinking water. MRI, histology, biochemistry, and ELISA characterized white matter lesions, and cognitive impairment was tested by Morris water maze. RESULTS: White matter damage was observed 4 to 5 weeks following permanent unilateral carotid artery occlusion/Japanese permissive diet. Immunoblotting showed marked reduction in myelin basic protein and upregulation of immature Ols. Mature Ols underwent caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Morris water maze showed cognitive impairment. Abnormally appearing vessels were observed and surrounded by inflammatory-like cells. IgG extravasation and hemorrhage, indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, was closely associated with MMP-9 expression. Lesions in white matter showed reactive astrocytosis and activated microglia that expressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha. MMP-3 and MMP-9 were significantly increased, and MMP-2 was reduced in both astrocytes and Ol. CONCLUSIONS: We found apoptosis of mature Ols with an increase in immature Ols. Increased MMP-3, MMP-9, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were associated with myelin breakdown and BBB disruption.

PUMA has been invovled in the onset and progress of several diseases, including cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and ischemic brain disease. Although many studies have shown that ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) can induce the apoptosis of astrocytes, the role of PUMA in I/R-mediated apoptosis of cerebral astrocyte apoptosis remains unclear. To mimic in vivo I/R conditions, primary mouse cerebral astrocytes were incubated in a combinational cultural condition of oxygen, glucose, and serum deprivation (OSGD) for 1 h followed by reperfusion (OSGD/R). Cell death determination assays and cell viability assays indicated that OSGD and OSGD/R induce the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. The expression of PUMA was significantly elevated in primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD/R. Moreover, targeted down-regulation of PUMA by siRNA transfection significantly decreased the OSGD/R-induced apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. We also found that OSGD and OSGD/R triggered the release of cytochrome c in astrocytes, indicating the dependence on a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was extremely generated during OSGD and OSGD/R, and the elimination of ROS by treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) remarkably inhibited the expression of PUMA and the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. The activation of Caspase 3 and Caspase 9 was extremely elevated in primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD.

In the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery was investigated in the postischemic rat brain.

The radioactivity concentration of (15)O rapidly achieved equilibrium in the blood and whole brain at about 2 minutes after H(2)(15)O and (15)O(2)-HbV administration, which was stable during the scans. The whole brain mean values of CBF, CBV, and CMRO(2) were 54.3+/-2.0 mL per 100 g per minute, 4.9+/-0.4 mL/100 g, and 2.8+/-0.2 mumoL per g per minute (6.2+/-0.4 mL per 100 g per minute) in the normal rats, respectively. In the MCAO model rats, all hemodynamic parameters of the infarction area on the occlusion side significantly decreased.

The pathophysiological mechanisms within the white matter accounting for cognitive dysfunction remain unclear. With the hypothesis that gliovascular interactions are impaired in subjects with high burdens of white matter hyperintensities, we performed clinicopathological studies in post-stroke survivors, who had exhibited greater frontal white matter hyperintensities volumes that predicted shorter time to dementia onset. Histopathological methods were used to identify substrates in the white matter that would distinguish post-stroke demented from post-stroke non-demented subjects. We focused on the reactive cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to study the incidence and location of clasmatodendrosis, a morphological attribute of irreversibly injured astrocytes. In contrast to normal appearing GFAP+ astrocytes, clasmatodendrocytes were swollen and had vacuolated cell bodies. Other markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member L1 (ALDH1L1) showed cytoplasmic disintegration of the astrocytes. Total GFAP+ cells in both the frontal and temporal white matter were not greater in post-stroke demented versus post-stroke non-demented subjects. However, the percentage of clasmatodendrocytes was increased by >2-fold in subjects with post-stroke demented compared to post-stroke non-demented subjects (P = 0.026) and by 11-fold in older controls versus young controls (P < 0.023) in the frontal white matter. High ratios of clasmotodendrocytes to total astrocytes in the frontal white matter were consistent with lower Mini-Mental State Examination and the revised Cambridge Cognition Examination scores in post-stroke demented subjects. Double immunofluorescent staining showed aberrant co-localization of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in retracted GFAP+ astrocytes with disrupted end-feet juxtaposed to microvessels. To explore whether this was associated with the disrupted gliovascular interactions or blood-brain barrier damage, we assessed the co-localization of GFAP and AQP4 immunoreactivities in post-mortem brains from adult baboons with cerebral hypoperfusive injury, induced by occlusion of three major vessels supplying blood to the brain. Analysis of the frontal white matter in perfused brains from the animals surviving 1-28 days after occlusion revealed that the highest intensity of fibrinogen immunoreactivity was at 14 days. At this survival time point, we also noted strikingly similar redistribution of AQP4 and GFAP+ astrocytes transformed into clasmatodendrocytes. Our findings suggest novel associations between irreversible astrocyte injury and disruption of gliovascular interactions at the blood-brain barrier in the frontal white matter and cognitive impairment in elderly post-stroke survivors. We propose that clasmatodendrosis is another pathological substrate, linked to white matter hyperintensities and frontal white matter changes, which may contribute to post-stroke or small vessel disease dementia.",2016,Journal Article,Brain,A.

The success of the hypoxia-ischemia-induced piglet model was confirmed by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. AQP4 knockdown led to reduced brain edema accompanied by a higher apparent diffusion coefficient value, compared to the control group injected with a plasmid containing scrambled siRNA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that AQP4 siRNA significantly reduced AQP4 mRNA and protein expression. Finally, neurological function analysis revealed that AQP4 knockdown significantly improved neurobehavioral manifestation of the piglets after exposure to hypoxia-ischemia.

Animal studies have revealed the molecular cascades that are initiated with hypoxia/ischemia in the cells forming the neurovascular unit and that contribute to cell death. Matrix metalloproteinases cause reversible degradation of tight junction proteins early after the onset of ischemia, and a delayed secondary opening during a neuroinflammatory response occurring from 24 to 72 hours after. Cyclooxygenases are important in the delayed opening as the neuroinflammatory response progresses. An early opening of the BBB within the 3-hour therapeutic window for tissue-type plasminogen activator can allow it to enter the brain and increase the risk of hemorrhage. Chronic hypoxic hypoperfusion opens the BBB, which contributes to the cognitive changes seen with lacunar strokes and white matter injury in subcortical ischemic vascular disease.

METHOD: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed to mice for 30 minutes to establish the model. The rats were divided into sham group, model group, BYHWD group and endostatin group. BYHWD (20 g x kg(-1), ig) and endostatin (10 mug, sc) were administered 24 h after ischemia once a day for consecutively 14 days. At 14 d after ischemia, the density of micro-vessel and the number of neuroblasts in the ischemia border zone were determined by immunofluorescence staining. The mRNA and protein expression of cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) were examined by real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULT: Compared with the model group, BYHWD significantly increased the density of micro-vessel and the number of DCX positive cells in the ischemia border zone (P < 0.01), and significantly increased the SDF-1 and BDNF mRNA and protein expression (P < 0.01). Compared with BYHWD group, endostatin significantly reduced the density of micro-vessel and the number of DCX positive cells in the ischemia border zone (P < 0.01), as well as the SDF-1, BDNF mRNA and protein expression (P < 0.01).

The objective of this study was to investigate the capability of (99m)Tc-labeled duramycin in detecting ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. METHODS: Ischemic cerebral injury was induced in ten rats by vascular insertion of a nylon suture in the left MCA for 3 hr followed by 21-24hr reperfusion. After i.v. injection of (99m)Tc-duramycin (1.0-3.5 mCi), dynamic cerebral images were acquired for 1 hr in six rats using a small-animal SPECT imager. Four other rats were imaged at 2 hr post-injection. Ex vivo images were obtained by autoradiography after sacrifice. Histologic analyses were performed to assess cerebral infarction and apoptosis. RESULTS: SPECT images showed that (99m)Tc-duramycin uptake in the left cerebral hemisphere was significantly higher than that in the right at 1 and 2 hr post-injection. The level of radioactive uptake in the ischemic brain varied based on ischemic severity. The average ratio of left cerebral hot-spot uptake to right hemisphere radioactivity, as determined by computerized ROI analysis, was 4.92+/-0.79. Fractional washout at 1 hr was 38.2+/-4.5% of peak activity for left cerebral hot-spot areas and 80.9+/-2.0% for remote control areas (P<0.001). Based on triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and autoradiograph image data, the hotspot uptake may be associated primarily with the ischemic penumbra, in which high apoptotic activity was observed by cleaved caspase-3 immunocytochemical staining.

However, a complete understanding of the origin and fate of the endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs) in vivo is missing. Tools and technology that allow non-invasive imaging and tracking of eNSCs in living animals will help to overcome this hurdle. In this study, we aimed to monitor eNSCs in a photothrombotic (PT) stroke model using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In a first strategy, inducible transgenic mice expressing firefly luciferase (Fluc) in the eNSCs were generated. In animals that received stroke, an increased BLI signal originating from the infarct region was observed. However, due to histological limitations, the identity and exact origin of cells contributing to the increased BLI signal could not be revealed. To overcome this limitation, we developed an alternative strategy employing stereotactic injection of conditional lentiviral vectors (Cre-Flex LVs) encoding Fluc and eGFP in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of Nestin-Cre transgenic mice, thereby specifically labeling the eNSCs. Upon induction of stroke, increased eNSC proliferation resulted in a significant increase in BLI signal between 2days and 2weeks after stroke, decreasing after 3months. Additionally, the BLI signal relocalized from the SVZ towards the infarct region during the 2weeks following stroke. Histological analysis at 90days post stroke showed that in the peri-infarct area, 36% of labeled eNSC progeny differentiated into astrocytes, while 21% differentiated into mature neurons. In conclusion, we developed and validated a novel imaging technique that unequivocally demonstrates that nestin(+) eNSCs originating from the SVZ respond to stroke injury by increased proliferation, migration towards the infarct region and differentiation into both astrocytes and neurons. In addition, this new approach allows non-invasive and specific monitoring of eNSCs over time, opening perspectives for preclinical evaluation of candidate stroke therapeutics.",2014,Journal Article,Neurobiol Dis,C.

The lack of animal models consistently replicating WM infarct damage may partially explain why many neuroprotective drugs for ischemic stroke or VCI have failed clinically, despite earlier success in preclinical experiments. Here, we report a novel animal model of WM infarct damage with cognitive impairment can be generated by surgical implantation of different devices to the right and left common carotid artery (CCA) in C57BL/6J mice. Implantation of an ameroid constrictor to the right CCA resulted in gradual occlusion of the vessel over 28 d, whereas placement of a microcoil to the left CCA induced approximately 50% arterial stenosis. Arterial spin labeling showed a gradual reduction of cerebral blood flow over 28 d post operation. Such reductions were more marked in the right, compared with the left, hemisphere and in subcortical, rather than the cortical, areas. Histopathological analysis showed multiple infarct damage in right subcortical regions, including the corpus callosum, internal capsule, hippocampal fimbria, and caudoputamen, in 81% of mice.

Blind introduction of autologous thrombus often fails to completely occlude a target vessel and, when successful, the precise timing of occlusion and revascularization is difficult to control. Studies of cellular biology and neuroimaging of acute reversible cerebral ischemia (ie, penumbral tissue) would benefit from a rabbit model in which LVO can be reliably induced, easily confirmed, and in which the time of occlusion and revascularization can be precisely controlled. METHODS: Transfemoral 1.5 F microcatheterization of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was performed in anesthetized rabbits (n=7) using fluoroscopic guidance. LVO with the wedged microcatheter was maintained for 30-210 min followed by reperfusion. Diffusion-weighted and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI was performed 3 h after catheter removal on a 3 T scanner. Post-mortem histopathologic analysis of brain tissue was performed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). RESULTS: Placing of the 1.5 F microcatheter tip in the PCA was successful in all seven animals. Infarct size on matched diffusion-weighted and TTC sections was strongly correlated (r(2)=0.86). Transient PCA occlusion of 30-60 min resulted in infarction of the ipsilateral hippocampus and thalamus, sparing the cortex, while more prolonged occlusion (180-210 min) resulted in cortical infarction as well. CONCLUSIONS: Image-guided microcatheter induction of PCA occlusion in rabbits can consistently produce time-dependent infarction of cortical and subcortical structures that is reliably detected by diffusion-weighted MRI, and thus may be a useful model for therapeutic studies in acute ischemic stroke.",2015,Journal Article,J Neurointerv Surg,J.

Furthermore, we will focus on two chemokines that recently have been associated with atherogenesis, CXCL12, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Both chemokines play a crucial role in leukocyte recruitment and arrest, a critical step in atherosclerosis development. MIF has shown to be a more pro-inflammatory and thus pro-atherogenic chemokine, instead CXCL12 seems to have a more protective function.

Small (< 5 mm(3)) lesions produced 24 hours before permanent focal ischemia were protective, without impacting baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism. Prior CL reduced infarct volume, associated with improved penumbral CBF as previously showed for ischemic preconditioning. The brief initial procedure avoided sham effects on infarct volume after subsequent occlusion under brief anesthesia. However, under prolonged isoflurane anesthesia for perfusion monitoring both sham and CL rats showed reduced PID incidence relative to naive animals. This anesthesia effect could be eliminated by using alpha-chloralose during perfusion imaging. As an additional methodological concern, blood glucose was frequently elevated at the time of the second surgery, reflecting buprenorphine-induced pica and other undefined mechanisms. Even modest hyperglycemia (>10 mmol/L) reduced PID incidence. In normoglycemic animals CL preconditioning reduced PID number by 50%, demonstrating associated effects on PID incidence, penumbral perfusion, and infarct progression. Hyperglycemia suppressed PIDs without affecting the relationship between CBF and infarction. This suggests that the primary effect of preconditioning is to improve penumbral perfusion, which in turn impacts PID incidence and infarct size.",2015,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,L.

This is an important issue because impaired vasoreactivity has been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, elevated overall cardiovascular risk and cognitive impairment. METHODS: To test whether dysregulation of CBF might be due to virally-induced neuroinflammation, we used a well-defined animal model (GFAP-driven, doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic (Tat-tg) mice). We then exposed the mice to a brief hypercapnic stimulus, and assessed cerebrovascular reactivity by measuring 1) changes in cerebral blood flow, using laser Doppler flowmetry and 2) changes in vascular dilation, using in vivo two-photon imaging. RESULTS: Exposure to brief hypercapnia revealed an underlying cerebrovascular pathology in Tat-tg mice. In control animals, brief hypercapnia induced a brisk increase in cortical flow (20.8% above baseline) and vascular dilation, as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and in vivo two-photon microscopy. These responses were significantly attenuated in Tat-tg mice (11.6% above baseline), but cortical microvascular morphology and capillary density were unaltered, suggesting that the functional pathology was not secondary to vascular remodeling. To examine the mechanistic basis for the diminished cerebrovascular response to brief hypercapnia, Tat-tg mice were treated with 1) gisadenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor and 2) tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Gisadenafil largely restored the normal increase in cortical flow following hypercapnia in Tat-tg mice (17.5% above baseline), whereas BH4 had little effect. Gisadenafil also restored the dilation of small (<25 mum) arterioles following hypercapnia (19.1% versus 20.6% diameter increase in control and Tat-tg plus gisadenafil, respectively), although it failed to restore full dilation of larger (>25 mum) vessels.

How do motors do this? Here we discuss mechanisms of motor force transduction, based on their mechanochemical cycles and conformational changes observed in crystal structures. Distortion or twisting of the central beta-sheet - proposed to trigger actin-induced Pi and ADP release by myosin, and microtubule-induced ADP release by kinesins - is shown in a movie depicting the transition between myosin ATP-like and nucleotide-free states. Structural changes in the switch I region form a tube that governs ATP hydrolysis and Pi release by the motors, explaining the essential role of switch I in hydrolysis. Comparison of the motor power strokes reveals that each stroke begins with the force-amplifying structure oriented opposite to the direction of rotation or swing. Motors undergo changes in their mechanochemical cycles in response to small-molecule inhibitors, several of which bind to kinesins by induced fit, trapping the motors in a state that resembles a force-producing conformation. An unusual motor activator specifically increases mechanical output by cardiac myosin, potentially providing valuable information about its mechanism of function.

Degradation of intracellular proteins via the UPS is a tightly regulated process initiated by tagging a target protein with a specific ubiquitin chain. Neurons are particularly vulnerable to any change in protein composition, and therefore the UPS is a key regulator of neuronal physiology. Alterations in UPS activity may induce pathological responses, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. Brain ischemia triggers a complex series of biochemical and molecular mechanisms, such as an inflammatory response, an exacerbated production of misfolded and oxidized proteins, due to oxidative stress, and the breakdown of cellular integrity mainly mediated by excitotoxic glutamatergic signaling. Brain ischemia also damages protein degradation pathways which, together with the overproduction of damaged proteins and consequent upregulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, contribute to the accumulation of ubiquitin-containing proteinaceous deposits. Despite recent advances, the factors leading to deposition of such aggregates after cerebral ischemic injury remain poorly understood. This review discusses the current knowledge on the role of the UPS in brain function and the molecular mechanisms contributing to UPS dysfunction in brain ischemia with consequent accumulation of ubiquitin-containing proteins. Chemical inhibitors of the proteasome and small molecule inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes, which promote the degradation of proteins by the proteasome, were both shown to provide neuroprotection in brain ischemia, and this apparent contradiction is also discussed in this review.",2014,Journal Article,Prog Neurobiol,M.

We discovered a unique compound TM6008, which inhibited PHD and stabilized HIF activity in vitro. Oral administration of TM6008 protected neurons in forebrain as well as focal ischemia. The protection was associated with amelioration of apoptosis but independent of enhanced angiogenesis. Next, elevating Akt activation is an obvious clinical strategy to prevent progressive neuronal death in neurological diseases. We identified a small molecule SC79 that inhibits Akt membrane translocation, but paradoxically activates Akt in the cytosol. SC79 specifically binds to the PH domain of Akt. SC79-bound Akt adopts a conformation favorable for phosphorylation by upstream protein kinases. In a hippocampal neuronal culture system and a mouse model for ischemic stroke, the cytosolic activation of Akt by SC79 is sufficient to recapitulate the primary cellular function of Akt signaling, resulting in augmented neuronal survival.

Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is an endogenous antioxidant protein that has neuroprotective effects. We hypothesized that Trx-1 plays a crucial role in regulating cerebral I/R injury. To be able to test this, 190 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) with Trx-1 siRNA (small interference RNA) injected 24 h prior to ischemia. At 24 h after tMCAO, we measured neurological deficits, infarct volume, and brain water content, and found that neurological dysfunction, brain infarct size, and brain edema were worse in the Trx-1 siRNA group than in the control group. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde level. The levels of Trx-1 and its cofactor, peroxiredoxin (Prdx), were significantly decreased after Trx-1 down-regulated. However, there is no significant difference in the Prdx mRNA level after administration of Trx-1 siRNA. In contrast, Prdx-SO3 protein levels were significantly increased in the Trx-1 siRNA group. We also investigated the specific role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Trx-1 induction by knocking down Nrf2. Nrf2 siRNA injection decreased Trx-1 mRNA and protein expression. Our results suggest that the exacerbation of brain damage was associated with enhanced cerebral peroxidation in brain tissues.

The objective of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-29 in neurodegeneration associated with acute ischemic stroke. Neural cell death caused by arachidonic acid insult of glutathione-deficient cells was preceded by a 12-lipoxygenase-dependent loss of miR-29b. Delivery of miR-29b mimic to blunt such loss was neuroprotective. miR-29b inhibition potentiated such neural cell death. 12-Lipoxygenase knockdown and inhibitors attenuated the loss of miR-29b in challenged cells. In vivo, stroke caused by middle-cerebral artery occlusion was followed by higher 12-lipoxygenase activity and loss of miR-29b as detected in laser-captured infarct site tissue. 12-Lipoxygenase knockout mice demonstrated protection against such miR loss. miR-29b gene delivery markedly attenuated stroke-induced brain lesion. Oral supplementation of alpha-tocotrienol, a vitamin E 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor, rescued stroke-induced loss of miR-29b and minimized lesion size.

Here we investigated the roles and possible targets of circulating microRNA-223 in human ischemic stroke within the first 72 hours. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients within 72 hours after cerebral ischemia (n = 79) and compared with healthy control samples (n = 75). The level of possible downstream factors of microRNA-223 including insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and interleukin-6 was examined by ELISA assay. The relationship between the microRNA-223 level and NIHSS scores, TOAST subtypes, and infarct volume was analyzed respectively. In addition, twelve adult male CD-1 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion using the suture technique. Circulating blood and brain tissue in the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere were collected at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. microRNA-223 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reactions. RESULTS: microRNA-223 levels in the circulating blood of acute ischemic stroke patients were greatly increased compared to the control (p < 0.05). microRNA-223, which were negatively correlated with NIHSS scores (r = -0.531, p < 0.01) and infarct volume (r = -0.265, p = 0.039), was significantly up-regulated in large artery and small artery strokes. The plasma level of insulin-like growth factor-1 was positively associated with that of microRNA-223 (r = 0.205, p = 0.022). Moreover, microRNA-223 in blood and brain were positively correlated (r = 0.834, p < 0.05), and they were up-regulated significantly in mice that underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (p < 0.05).

In recent years, SIRT2 inhibition has emerged as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. However, to date, there is no evidence of a specific role for SIRT2 in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We investigated the effects of SIRT2 inhibition on experimental TBI using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model. Adult male mice underwent CCI or sham surgery. A selective brain-permeable SIRT2 inhibitor, AK-7, was administrated 30 min before injury. The volume of the brain edema lesion and the water content of the brain were significantly increased in mice treated with AK-7 (20 mg/kg), compared with the vehicle group, following TBI (p < 0.05 at 1 day and p < 0.05 at 3 days, respectively). Concomitantly, AK-7 administration greatly worsened neurobehavioral deficits on days 3 and 7 after CCI. Furthermore, blood-brain barrier disruption and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 activity increased following SIRT2 inhibition. AK-7 treatment increased TBI-induced microglial activation both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by a large increase in the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, SIRT2 inhibition increased both K310 acetylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65, leading to enhanced NF-kappaB activation and up-regulation of its target genes, including aquaporin 4 (AQP4), MMP-9, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these data demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition exacerbates TBI by increasing NF-kappaB p65 acetylation and activation. Our findings provide additional evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of SIRT2. SIRT2 is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. Our study suggests that the SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 exacerbates traumatic brain injury (TBI) via a potential mechanism involving increased acetylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65, resulting in up-regulation of NF-kappaB target genes, including aquaporin 4 (AQP4), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Accordingly, endothelial dysfunction underpins many cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Herein, we evaluated mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Nppc, which encodes C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and determined that this mediator is essential for multiple aspects of vascular regulation. Specifically, disruption of CNP leads to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, atherogenesis, and aneurysm. Moreover, we identified natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) as the cognate receptor that primarily underlies CNP-dependent vasoprotective functions and developed small-molecule NPR-C agonists to target this pathway. Administration of NPR-C agonists promotes a vasorelaxation of isolated resistance arteries and a reduction in blood pressure in wild-type animals that is diminished in mice lacking NPR-C. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association studies that have linked the NPR-C (Npr3) locus with hypertension by demonstrating the importance of CNP/NPR-C signaling in preserving vascular homoeostasis.

A silent stroke may indicate elevated susceptibility to recurrent stroke, which may eventually result in apparent and lasting impairments.

Adult male rats with focal ischemia received single focal ischemic mini-lesions in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) or the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), or multiple lesions affecting both SMC and DLS. The time course and outcome of motor compensation and recovery were determined by quantitative and qualitative assessment of skilled reaching and skilled walking. Rats with SMC or DLS lesion alone did not show behavioral deficits in either task. However, the combination of focal ischemic lesions in SMC and DLS perturbed skilled reaching accuracy and disrupted forelimb placement in the ladder rung walking task.

Specifically, ICH was induced in 5 healthy beagles by injecting 500 U of bacterial collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum, which was delivered into the parietal lobe over 5 min by using a microinfusion pump. T1- and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, gradient-echo (GRE), and diffusion-weighted (DWI) imaging and measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed serially at 6 different time points (before and 12 h, 3 d, 5 d, 10 d and 24 d after hemorrhage) by using a 3-T MR system. The temporal changes of T1 signal intensity (SI) corresponded well with the reported human data. The temporal changes of T2 and GRE sequences, with the exception of T2 and GRE hyperintensities at the early subacute stage, also matched.

Following illumination, the dye is activated and produces singlet oxygen that damages components of endothelial cell membranes, with subsequent platelet aggregation and thrombi formation, which eventually determines the interruption of local blood flow. This approach, initially proposed by Rosenblum and El-Sabban in 1977, was later improved by Watson in 1985 in rat brain and set the basis of the current model. Also, the increased availability of transgenic mouse lines further contributed to raise the interest on the photothrombosis model. Briefly, a photosensitive dye (Rose Bengal) is injected intraperitoneally and enters the blood stream. When illuminated by a cold light source, the dye becomes activated and induces endothelial damage with platelet activation and thrombosis, resulting in local blood flow interruption. The light source can be applied on the intact skull with no need of craniotomy, which allows targeting of any cortical area of interest in a reproducible and non-invasive way. The mouse is then sutured and allowed to wake up. The evaluation of ischemic damage can be quickly accomplished by triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride or cresyl violet staining. This technique produces infarction of small size and well-delimited boundaries, which is highly advantageous for precise cell characterization or functional studies.

For the first time, isoquercetin is described as a neuroprotective agent that potentially explains the alleviation and prevention from OGD/R-induced injury in neurons.

Neurochem. (2012) 123, 226-238. ABSTRACT: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single genetic cause of mental retardation and autistic spectrum disease, occurs when FMR1 gene is mutated. FMR1 encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) which regulates translation of mRNAs playing important roles in the development of neurons as well as formation and maintenance of synapses. To examine whether FMRP regulates cell viability, we induced apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons with glutamate in vitro and with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in striatal neurons in vivo. Both conditions elicited a rapid, but transient FMRP expression in neurons. This up-regulated FMRP expression was abolished by pre-treatment with PI3K and Protein Kinase B (Akt) inhibitors: LY294002, Akt inhibitor IV, and VIII. Reduced FMRP expression in vitro or in vivo using small hairpin Fmr1 virus exacerbated cell death by glutamate or MCAO, presumably via hypophosphorylation of Akt and reduced expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). However, over-expression of FMRP using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-FMRP constructs alleviated cell death, increased Akt activity, and enhanced Bcl-xL production. The pro-survival role of Akt-dependent up-regulation of FMRP in glutamate-stimulated cultured neuron as well as in ischemic brain may have a clinical importance in FXS as well as in neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic brain injury.",2012,Journal Article,J Neurochem,S.

We investigated the association between plasma phospholipid omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), objective biomarkers of exposure, and subclinical brain abnormalities on MRI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the community-based Cardiovascular Health Study, 3660 participants aged >/= 65 underwent brain MRI in 1992-1994, and 2313 were rescanned 5 years later. MRIs were centrally read by neuroradiologists in a standardized, blinded manner. Participants with recognized transient ischemic attacks or stroke were excluded. Phospholipid PUFAs were measured in stored plasma collected in 1992-1993 and related to cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI findings. After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratio for having a prevalent subclinical infarct was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.82; P for trend = 0.001) in the highest versus lowest long-chain omega-3 PUFA quartile. Higher long-chain omega-3 PUFA content was also associated with better white matter grade, but not with sulcal or ventricular grades, markers of brain atrophy, or with incident subclinical infarcts. The phospholipid intermediate-chain omega-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid was associated only with modestly better sulcal and ventricular grades. However, this finding was not supported in the analyses with alpha-linolenic acid intake. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, higher phospholipid long-chain omega-3 PUFA content was associated with lower prevalence of subclinical infarcts and better white matter grade on MRI. Our results support the beneficial effects of fish consumption, the major source of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, on brain health in later life.

TIMP3 and vitronectin are 2 extracellular matrix proteins that abnormally accumulate in Notch3(ECD) -containing deposits on brain vessels of mice and patients with CADASIL. Herein, we investigated whether increased levels of TIMP3 and vitronectin are responsible for aspects of CADASIL disease phenotypes. METHODS: Timp3 and vitronectin expression were genetically reduced in TgNotch3(R169C) mice, a well-established preclinical model of CADASIL. A mouse overexpressing human TIMP3 (TgBAC-TIMP3) was developed. Disease-related phenotypes, including cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits, white matter lesions, and Notch3(ECD) deposition, were evaluated between 6 and 20 months of age. RESULTS: CBF responses to neural activity (functional hyperemia), topical application of vasodilators, and decreases in blood pressure (CBF autoregulation) were similarly reduced in TgNotch3(R169C) and TgBAC-TIMP3 mice, and myogenic responses of brain arteries were likewise attenuated. These defects were rescued in TgNotch3(R169C) mice by haploinsufficiency of Timp3, although the number of white matter lesions was unaffected. In contrast, haploinsufficiency or loss of vitronectin in TgNotch3(R169C) mice ameliorated white matter lesions, although CBF responses were unchanged. Amelioration of cerebrovascular reactivity or white matter lesions in these mice was not associated with reduced Notch3(ECD) deposition in brain vessels.

This study reported that the active core peptide sequence P30 (amino acids 49-78) of ProTalpha exerts its full survival effect in cultured cortical neurons against ischemic stress. Our in vivo study revealed that intravitreous administration of P30 at 24 h after retinal ischemia significantly blocks the ischemia-induced functional damages of retina at day 7.

Currently, we are missing appropriate methodology to study micro-strokes in experimental animals.

Cerebral white matter changes are a consistent manifestation of SVD on neuroimaging, progressing silently for many years before becoming clinically evident. The pathogenesis of these changes remains poorly understood, despite their importance. In particular, their pathological correlate at early stages remains largely undefined. Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), caused by dominant mutations of the NOTCH3 receptor, is regarded as a paradigm for the most common form of sporadic SVD. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy, together with qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess oligodendroglial, axon and myelin damage in TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice, a model of preclinical CADASIL. RESULTS: The principal cerebral white matter changes in TgPAC-Notch3R169C mice are microvacuoles (</= 1 mum diameter) in the myelin sheaths associated with focal myelin degradation and occurring in the absence of oligodendrocyte loss. Half the damaged myelin sheaths still contain an apparently intact axon. Clearance of myelin debris appears inefficient, as demonstrated by the significant but mild microglial reaction, with occasional myelin debris either contacted or internalized by microglial cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that segmental intramyelinic oedema is an early, conspicuous white matter change in CADASIL. Brain white matter intramyelinic oedema is consistently found in patients and mouse models with compromised ion and water homeostasis. These data provide a starting point for novel mechanistic studies to investigate the pathogenesis of SVD-related white matter changes.",2014,Journal Article,Acta Neuropathol Commun,E.

Epileptiform discharges are thought to exacerbate postischemic brain function. The aim of this study was to develop an in vivo focal stroke model in rats to characterize epileptiform activity. METHODS: The authors developed a parasagittal 8-channel intracortical microelectrode array to obtain recordings of cortical oscillations of local field potentials following partial middle and anterior cerebral artery occlusion. All experiments were done in urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. RESULTS: Theta runs (TRs), ranging in duration from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, were observed in 62% of animals within 1 hour of occlusion. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the high gamma range (80-120 Hz) were observed 5-15 seconds before each TR and terminated at the onset of the discharge. Periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) were detected in 54% of rats following ischemia. The PEDs consisted of an early negative slow wave, a high-amplitude positive spike, and a short negative slow wave. Transient HFOs in the low gamma range (30-70 Hz) occurred during the first negative wave and the rising phase of the positive spike of the PED. CONCLUSIONS: These recordings provide the first intracortical evidence of a high-frequency component that could be an important element for diagnosis and intervention in postischemic epileptogenic activity. The early onset also suggests that HFOs could serve as a reliable method of detecting small epileptiform events and could be used as a consideration in deciding whether antiepileptic medications are appropriate as part of a patient's poststroke care.",2013,Journal Article,J Neurosurg,L.

When placed in the cylinder, rodents explore by rearing and touching the walls of the cylinder with their forelimb paws for postural support. Following ischemic injury to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, rats rely more heavily on their unaffected forelimb paw for postural support resulting in fewer touches with their affected paw which is termed forelimb asymmetry. In contrast, focal ischemic damage in the mouse brain fails to result in comparable consistent deficits in forelimb asymmetry. While forelimb asymmetry deficits are infrequently observed, mice do demonstrate a novel behaviour post stroke termed ""paw-dragging"". Paw-dragging is the tendency for a mouse to drag its affected paw along the cylinder wall rather than directly push off from the wall when dismounting from a rear to a four-legged stance. We have previously demonstrated that paw-dragging behaviour is highly sensitive to small cortical ischemic injuries to the forelimb motor cortex. Here we provide a detailed protocol for paw-dragging analysis. We define what a paw-drag is and demonstrate how to quantify paw-dragging behaviour. The cylinder test is a simple and inexpensive test to administer and does not require pre-training or food deprivation strategies. In using paw-dragging analysis with the cylinder test, it fills a niche for predicting cortical ischemic injuries such as photothrombosis and Endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced ischemia--two models that are ever-increasing in popularity and produce smaller focal injuries than middle cerebral artery occlusion. Finally, measuring paw-dragging behaviour in the cylinder test will allow studies of functional recovery after cortical injury using a wide cohort of transgenic mouse strains where previous forelimb asymmetry analysis has failed to detect consistent deficits.",2015,Journal Article,J Vis Exp,R.

Starting with the widespread use of IV tissue plasminogen activator, a wide variety of pharmacologic and mechanical methods have been introduced to improve vessel recanalization and clinical outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke, which include endovascular therapies such as intra-arterial thrombolytics and mechanical thrombectomy devices. One of the potential therapies is angioplasty and stenting, and this has been evaluated in multiple case reports and small series published by various centers regarding its use in this setting.

The glutathione (GSH) system plays a pivotal role in combating oxidative stress in various cell types. To determine whether oral GSH administration elicits anti-oxidative effects, we assessed its potential neuroprotective effects in transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) mice. In naive mice, acute oral administration of GSH significantly increased GSH levels by 1h in the cortex and hippocampus. Eleven days after BCCAO, untreated mice showed significantly decreased GSH levels and an inverse elevation of glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) levels in both the cortex and hippocampus. Oral administration of GSH (100 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) for 10 consecutive days after ischemia restored reduced GSH levels and inhibited GSSG elevation. Notably, post-administration of GSH (100 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) significantly prevented neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 region in BCCAO mice, an effect closely correlated with decreased levels of oxidative markers such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and nitrotyrosine in that region. Finally, GSH administration for 10 days improved memory deficits observed in BCCAO mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that the anti-oxidative effect of oral GSH administration ameliorates post-ischemia neuronal cell death and, in turn, may improve memory.",2013,Journal Article,Neuroscience,Y.

The standard method of corticosterone quantification often requires the collection of a relatively large volume of blood, followed by the extraction of the blood plasma. An alternative blood sampling method requires the collection of only a drop of blood on paper (the 'drop' method), minimizing handling of the animals, and does not require plasma extraction. The authors aimed to validate the drop method of blood sampling for use in corticosterone quantification. They induced stress in rats by cerebral ischemia, collected blood samples at various intervals using both the drop method and the plasma extraction method and then quantified corticosterone by radioimmunoassay. Corticosterone levels of the ischemic rats were compared with those of sham-operated rats and those of ischemic rats that had been given metyrapone, a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, prior to vessel occlusion. Blood corticosterone levels in the samples obtained from the same animal using the two different methods were highly correlated for all rats. The authors further provide a regression model that can be used to predict plasma corticosterone values from those obtained from the drop blood samples.

Previously, we identified MMP8 as a new neuroinflammatory mediator in activated microglia by regulating TNF-alpha productivity. Here, we present evidence that MMP8 is a critical factor for brain damage in transient focal cerebral ischemia by modulating neuroinflammation likely microglial activation and TNF-alpha production. Biochemical analyses showed upregulation of MMP8 expression at mRNA and protein levels in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (M/R)-challenged brains. Furthermore, double immunolabeling showed that MMP8 expression was upregulated in the activated microglia of M/R-challenged brains. Assessment of infarct volume, neurological score, and survival/death of neural cells revealed that administration of an MMP8 inhibitor (M8I) immediately after reperfusion reduced brain damage. Histological analyses showed that microglial activation and TNF-alpha expression in ischemic conditions was abrogated by exposure to M8I, as demonstrated in our previous study using cultured microglia. These outcomes from a pharmacological approach were reaffirmed by a genetic approach using a lentiviral system. Intracerebroventricular microinjection of MMP8-specific shRNA lentivirus reduced the extent of ischemia-induced brain damage, as assessed by infarct volume, neurological score, microglial activation, and TNF-alpha expression.

Thus, the development of a new strategy to combat inflammation during thrombolysis is an urgent demand. The small molecule thrombolytic SMTP-7 effectively treats ischemic stroke in several animal models with reducing cerebral hemorrhage. Here we revealed that SMTP-7 targeted soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to suppress inflammation. SMTP-7 inhibited both of the two sEH enzyme activities: epoxide hydrolase (which inactivates anti-inflammatory epoxy-fatty acids) and lipid phosphate phosphatase. SMTP-7 suppressed epoxy-fatty acid hydrolysis in HepG2 cells in culture, implicating the sEH inhibition in the anti-inflammatory mechanism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Copper stents were implanted in the left descending coronary arteries of 64 pigs to induce anterior wall myocardial infarction. The pigs were assigned randomly to group A (n=8; killed at 1 week), group B (n=8; killed at 2 weeks), group C (n=16; killed at 4 weeks), group D (n=16; killed at 3 months), and group E (n=16; killed at 6 months). The control group included six pigs that were subjected to the same procedures but without implantation of copper stents. The wall area (WA) and lumen area (LA) of small intramyocardial coronary arteries (SIMCA) distal to occlusions were measured and the ratios of WA/LA and LA/total vessel area (%L) were calculated. The composition of the arterial wall was determined by Masson's trichrome stain, transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: A significant increase in WA/LA and decrease %L in SIMCA were observed in group B (P<0.05), group C (P<0.01), group D (P<0.01), and group E (P<0.01) compared with the control. There was increased area of collagen fiber in the thickened arterial wall in group C (P<0.05), group D (P<0.01), and group E (P<0.01) compared with the control group, group A, and group B. A significantly increased ratio of the synthetic phenotype vascular smooth muscle cells were found in group B (P<0.05), group C (P<0.01), group D (P<0.01), and group E (P<0.01) compared with the control group.

Experiments on small animals using automated morphometric methods usually require expensive measurements with ultra-high field dedicated animal MRI systems.

A landmark-based transformation of our customized reference brain into the coordinates of the widely used rat brain atlas from Paxinos and Watson (Paxinos Atlas) guarantees the comparability of results to other studies. For cross-sectional data, we warped images onto the reference brain using the low-dimensional nonlinear registration implemented in the MATLAB software package SPM8. For the analysis of longitudinal data sets, we chose high-dimensional registrations of all images of one data set to the first baseline image which facilitate the identification of more subtle structural changes. Because all deformations were finally used to transform the data into the space of the Paxinos Atlas, Jacobian determinants could be used to estimate absolute local volumes of predefined regions-of-interest. Pilot experiments were performed to analyze brain structural changes due to aging or photothrombotically-induced cortical stroke.

Its efficacy, however, might be limited because of massive grafted-cell death after transplantation, and its insufficient capability for tissue repair. Interleukin 6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. Paradoxically, interleukin 6 promotes a pro-survival signalling pathway through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. In this study, we investigated whether cellular reprogramming of neural stem cells with interleukin 6 facilitates the effectiveness of cell transplantation therapy in ischaemic stroke. Neural stem cells harvested from the subventricular zone of foetal mice were preconditioned with interleukin 6 in vitro and transplanted into mouse brains 6 h or 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Interleukin 6 preconditioning protected the grafted neural stem cells from ischaemic reperfusion injury through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-mediated upregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase, a primary mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme. In addition, interleukin 6 preconditioning induced secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor from the neural stem cells through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, resulting in promotion of angiogenesis in the ischaemic brain. Furthermore, transplantation of interleukin 6-preconditioned neural stem cells significantly attenuated infarct size and improved neurological performance compared with non-preconditioned neural stem cells. This interleukin 6-induced amelioration of ischaemic insults was abolished by transfecting the neural stem cells with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 small interfering RNA before transplantation. These results indicate that preconditioning with interleukin 6, which reprograms neural stem cells to tolerate oxidative stress after ischaemic reperfusion injury and to induce angiogenesis through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, is a simple and beneficial approach for enhancing the effectiveness of cell transplantation therapy in ischaemic stroke.",2012,Journal Article,Brain,H.

As spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) may be a valid model of some aspects of human CSVD, we aimed to identify whether those changes occur in definite temporal stages and whether there is an initial phenomenon beyond those common vascular alterations. Groups of 51 SHRSP were examined simultaneously by histologic (Hematoxylin-Eosin, IgG-Immunohistochemistry, vessel diameter measurement) and imaging methods (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 201-Thallium-Diethyldithiocarbamate/99m-Technetium-HMPAO Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography conducted as pilot study) at different stages of age. Vascular pathology in SHRSP proceeds in definite stages, whereas an age-dependent accumulation of erythrocytes in capillaries and arterioles represents the homogeneous initial step of the disease. Erythrocyte accumulations are followed by BBB disturbances and microbleeds, both also increasing with age. Microthromboses, tissue infarctions with CBF reduction, and disturbed potassium uptake represent the final stage of vascular pathology in SHRSP. Erythrocyte accumulations--we parsimoniously interpreted as stases--without cerebral tissue damage represent the first step of vascular pathology in SHRSP.

Inflammation is believed to be an important contributing factor to these injuries. The aim of this study was to examine the immune response in a postnatal day (PND) 5 mouse model of preterm brain injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI) that is characterized by focal white and gray-matter injury. METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice at PND 5 were subjected to unilateral HI induced by left carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 10% O2 for 50 minutes, 70 minutes, or 80 minutes. At seven days post-HI, the white/gray-matter injury was examined. The immune responses in the brain after HI were examined at different time points after HI using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: HI for 70 minutes in PND 5 mice induced local white-matter injury with focal cortical injury and hippocampal atrophy, features that are similar to those seen in preterm brain injury in human infants. HI for 50 minutes resulted in a small percentage of animals being injured, and HI for 80 minutes produced extensive infarction in multiple brain areas. Various immune responses, including changes in transcription factors and cytokines that are associated with a T-helper (Th)1/Th17-type response, an increased number of CD4+ T-cells, and elevated levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) and its adaptor protein DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) were observed using the HI 70 minute preterm brain injury model. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a reproducible model of HI in PND 5 mice that produces consistent local white/gray-matter brain damage that is relevant to preterm brain injury in human infants. This model provides a useful tool for studying preterm brain injury. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are observed after HI, and these show a strong pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17-type bias. Such findings provide a critical foundation for future studies on the mechanism of preterm brain injury and suggest that blocking the Th1/Th17-type immune response might provide neuroprotection after preterm brain injury.",2014,Journal Article,J Neuroinflammation,A.

Thioredoxin-1(Trx-1) protein has been reported to have anti-apoptotic effects in a variety of cell types, and it has been implicated in brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Thus, we studied the effects of Trx1 silencing after MCAO in rats and examined whether inhibition of endogenous Trx1 could increase tissue levels of apoptosis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=170) were subjected to 1h of middle cerebral arterial occlusion followed by 24h of reperfusion. Trx1 siRNAs were injected into rat brains 24h prior to MCAO. Then, 24h after MCAO, brains were collected from euthanized rats for investigation. Treatment with Trx1 siRNA significantly increased mortality, behavioral deficits, and cerebral infarction volume and exacerbated neuronal cell apoptotic death after MCAO injury. Western blot revealed increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as P-ASK1, P-JNK, P-p38, cleaved caspase-3 and increased the level of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction in the Trx1 siRNA-treated group. Co-immunoprecipitation assay suggested an interaction between Trx1 and ASK1 in normal rat brains and Trx1 siRNA dissociated ASK1-Trx1 binding complex. Our data suggest that Trx1 siRNA increases apoptotic stress-induced ASK1 activation and this represents further evidence that Trx1 is an endogenous anti-apoptotic molecule that diminishes focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

However, only a small fraction of the neural stem/progenitor cells survives. In this report, the effects of methylprednisolone (MP) on proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural progenitor cells were explored through early MP administration after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo). Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in Sprague Dawley male rats. One hour, 1 day, 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days after MCAo, neurological examination was performed to evaluate the neurological deficit. MCAo rats were randomly divided into two groups, MP-group was injected MP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) at 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h after MCAo, and vehicle group was injected equal saline (i.p.). Animals were sacrificed at 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days after MCAo. MP was found to decrease apoptosis and TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression at 3 days after MCAo in the ipsilateral striatum. Moreover, MP significantly increased the migrated new neurons (BrdU+/ DCX+) and immature neurons (BrdU+/Tuj1+) at day 14 after MCAo in the ipsilateral striatum. Likewise, MP increased the number of mature neurons (BrdU+/MAP2+) at 28 days after MCAo. However, MP did not affect the progenitor cell proliferation (BrdU+ and Nestin+) at day 3 after MCAo in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but improved the neurological deficit at day 1 and day 3 after MCAo.

The antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated antioxidant pathway plays an important role in maintaining the redox status of the brain. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), combined with potent AREs in the promoter of HO-1, is a highly effective therapeutic target for protection against cerebral IRI. Pterostilbene (PTE), a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol from blueberries, is a strong natural antioxidant. PTE has been shown to be beneficial for some nervous system diseases and may regulate HO-1 signaling. This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of PTE on cerebral IRI and to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying those effects. Mouse brains and cultured HT22 neuron cells were subjected to IRI. Prior to this procedure, the brains or cells were exposed to PTE in the absence or presence of the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP or HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). PTE conferred a cerebral protective effect, as shown by increased neurological scores, viable neurons and decreased brain edema as well as a decreased ion content and apoptotic ratio in vivo. PTE also increased the cell viability and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and apoptotic ratio in vitro. ZnPP and HO-1 siRNA both blocked PTE-mediated cerebral protection by inhibiting HO-1 signaling and further inhibited two HO-1 signaling-related antioxidant molecules: NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are induced by PTE. PTE also promoted a well-preserved mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondria complex I activity, and mitochondria complex IV activity, increased the mitochondrial cytochrome c level, and decreased the cytosolic cytochrome c level.

This review examines critically the safety of MPA in terms of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease risk, and its effects on brain function. Research into mechanisms by which MPA might cause adverse effects in these areas, combined with the available clinical evidence, suggests a small increase in relative risk for breast cancer and stroke, and a decline in cognitive function, in older women using MPA with an estrogen for postmenopausal HT. However, short-term (less than 5 years) use of MPA with an estrogen in the years immediately after the onset of menopause for the management of vasomotor symptoms does not appear to be associated with any increased risk of these disorders.",2014,Journal Article,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,F.

Information about remaining viable tissue as measured with perfusion imaging is crucial for proper patient selection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perfusion imaging with C-arm CT in the angiography suite is feasible and provides measurements comparable with ones made by CTP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MCA was occluded surgically in 6 sheep. Perfusion studies were performed before surgery, immediately after, and at 3 hours after MCA occlusion by using a robotic flat panel detector C-arm angiographic system. For comparison, conventional CTP was performed at the same time points. Two different protocols with the C-arm CT were tested. Images were analyzed by 2 readers with regard to the presence and size of perfusion abnormalities. RESULTS: With C-arm CT, perfusion abnormalities were detected with a high sensitivity and specificity when vessel occlusion was confirmed by criterion standard DSA. No difference was found between lesions sizes measured with the 2 C-arm CT protocols and CTP. Growth of the CBV lesions with time was captured with C-arm CT and CTP.

Recently, we were the first to report that orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77 is a critical mediator of angiogenesis and its associated microvessel permeability. Tumor growth and angiogenesis induced by VEGF-A, histamine, and serotonin are almost completely inhibited in Nur77 knockout mice. However, it is not known whether TR3/Nur77 plays any roles in wound healing. In these studies, skin wound-healing assay was performed in 3 types of genetically modified mice having various Nur77 activities. We found that ectopic induction of Nur77 in endothelial cells of mice is sufficient to improve skin wound healing. Although skin wound healing in Nur77 knockout mice is comparable to the wild-type control mice, the process is significantly delayed in the EC-Nur77-DN mice, in which a dominant negative Nur77 mutant is inducibly and specifically expressed in mouse endothelial cells. By a loss-of-function assay, we elucidate a novel feed-forward signaling pathway, integrin beta4 --> PI3K --> Akt --> FAK, by which TR3 mediates HUVEC migration. Furthermore, TR3/Nur77 regulates the expression of integrin beta4 by targeting its promoter activity. In conclusion, expression of TR3/Nur77 improves wound healing by targeting integrin beta4. TR3/Nur77 is a potential candidate for proangiogenic therapy. The results further suggest that TR3/Nur77 is required for pathologic angiogenesis but not for developmental/physiologic angiogenesis and that Nur77 and its family members play a redundant role in normal skin wound healing.",2015,Journal Article,FASEB J,G.

Parecoxib is clinically used for short-term management of postoperative pain. Administration of parecoxib in rats has been reported to protect against the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of parecoxib is still largely unknown. In this study, we found parecoxib could protect against neurotoxicity induced by 4 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) plus reoxgenation for 20 h, a widely used in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, we characterized the molecular mechanism of parecoxib's neuroprotection. We found parecoxib was able to activate CREB, and subsequently maintained the expression of Bcl-2, which is an important mitochondria-associated protein. Inhibition of endogenous Bcl-2 expression by transfection of Bcl-2-shRNA significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effects of parecoxib treatment. Furthermore, ATP production assay and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) assay suggested that parecoxib exerted neuroprotective effect against OGD/R by maintaining the function of mitochondria.

But, recent findings suggest that HMGB1 can play a surprisingly beneficial role during stroke recovery by promoting endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function and vascular remodeling in cortical gray matter. Here, we ask whether HMGB1 may also influence EPC responses in white matter injury. The standard lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) injection model was used to induce focal demyelination in the corpus callosum of mice. Immunostaining showed that within the focal white matter lesions, HMGB1 was up-regulated in GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes, along with the accumulation of Flk1/CD34-double-positive EPCs that expressed pro-recovery mediators such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Astrocyte-EPC signaling required the HMGB1 receptor RAGE as treatment with RAGE-neutralizing antibody significantly decreased EPC accumulation. Moreover, suppression of HMGB1 with siRNA in vivo significantly decreased EPC numbers in damaged white matter as well as proliferated endothelial cell numbers. Finally, in vitro cell culture systems confirmed that HMGB1 directly affected EPC function such as migration and tube formation. Taken together, our findings suggest that HMGB1 from reactive astrocytes may attract EPCs to promote recovery after white matter injury.",2013,Journal Article,J Neurochem,K.

A possible explanation for 'collateral failure' and infarct expansion after ischemic stroke,"Recent human imaging studies indicate that reduced blood flow through pial collateral vessels ('collateral failure') is associated with late infarct expansion despite stable arterial occlusion. The cause for 'collateral failure' is unknown. We recently showed that intracranial pressure (ICP) rises dramatically but transiently 24 hours after even minor experimental stroke. We hypothesized that ICP elevation would reduce collateral blood flow. First, we investigated the regulation of flow through collateral vessels and the penetrating arterioles arising from them during stroke reperfusion. Wistar rats were subjected to intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAo). Individual pial collateral and associated penetrating arteriole blood flow was quantified using fluorescent microspheres. Baseline bidirectional flow changed to MCA-directed flow and increased by >450% immediately after MCAo. Collateral diameter changed minimally. Second, we determined the effect of ICP elevation on collateral and watershed penetrating arteriole flow. Intracranial pressure was artificially raised in stepwise increments during MCAo. The ICP increase was strongly correlated with collateral and penetrating arteriole flow reductions. Changes in collateral flow post-stroke appear to be primarily driven by the pressure drop across the collateral vessel, not vessel diameter. The ICP elevation reduces cerebral perfusion pressure and collateral flow, and is the possible explanation for 'collateral failure' in stroke-in-progression.",2015,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,D.

Rac1 GTPase is involved in cellular protection from IR injury. However, the mechanism of protection and the molecules affected by Rac1 remain to be defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1h, followed by 24-h reperfusion. In this in vivo model of cerebral IR injury, mice treated with the Rac GTPase inhibitor NSC23766 or Rac1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) had better short-term (72 h) neurologic scores, less infarction volume, higher production of antioxidant enzymes, lower lipid peroxide, and reduced apoptosis compared with a vehicle-treated group or a control-siRNA group. However, long-term (14 day) neurologic scores were worse for the two treatments compared to controls. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that Notch2 was downregulated under NSC23766 treatment. Notch2 protein levels decreased with NSC23766 and Rac1 siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Cell survival increased with the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT or Notch2 siRNA and NICD2 attenuated the NSC23766 effect. In addition, immunoblotting showed that DAPT and Notch2 siRNA changed the levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins. NFkB mediated Rac1, which regulated Notch2 in an oxygen glucose deprivation model. Both inhibitors of Notch2 and Rac1 enhanced neural stem cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the importance of Rac1 regulation of Notch2 in mediating cerebral IR-induced production of injurious reactive oxygen species and cell death in vitro and in vivo in the short term.

However, the upstream events that initiate inflammatory responses following ICH remain elusive. Our previous studies suggested that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be the upstream signal that triggers inflammatory injury in ICH. In addition, recent clinical findings indicated that both TLR2 and TLR4 may participate in ICH-induced brain injury. However, it is unclear how TLR2 functions in ICH-induced inflammatory injury and how TLR2 interacts with TLR4. METHODS: The role of TLR2 and TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization in ICH-induced inflammatory injury was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH. RESULTS: TLR2 mediated ICH-induced inflammatory injury, which forms a heterodimer with TLR4 in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH. Hemoglobin (Hb), but not other blood components, triggered inflammatory injury in ICH via assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), but not TRIF (Toll/IR-1 domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta), was required for ICH-induced TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization. Mutation of MyD88 Arg196 abolished the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that a novel TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer induced by Hb initiates inflammatory injury in ICH.

To resolve these issues, focal brain cooling (FBC) has recently drawn attention as a less-invasive treatment for brain injuries. Therefore, we investigated whether FBC has a favorable effect on focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Male-adult-Wistar rats were used. Under general anesthesia, a small burr hole was made and FCI was induced in the primary sensorimotor area (SI-MI) using photothrombosis. An additional craniotomy was made over the SI-MI and FBC was performed at a temperature of 15 degrees C for 5h. Electrocorticograms (ECoG) were recorded on the border cortex of the ischemic focus. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed and the infarct area was measured. In another experiment, rats were allowed to recover for 5 days after cooling and neurobehavioral function was evaluated. FBC suppressed all ECoG frequency bands during and after cooling (p<0.05), except for the delta frequency band in the precooling versus rewarming periods. The injured areas in the cooling and non-cooling groups were 0.99+/-0.30 and 1.71+/-0.54 mm(2), respectively (p<0.03). The grip strength at 2 days after surgery was preserved in the cooling group (p<0.05).

METHODS: Thirty-six elastase-induced aneurysms in rabbits were treated with flow diverting devices. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed angiographically immediately before they were sacrificed at 1 (n=6), 2 (n=4), 4 (n=8) or 8 weeks (n=18) after treatment. The aneurysms were classified into a fast occlusion group if they were completely or near completely occluded at 4 weeks or earlier and a slow occlusion group if they remained incompletely occluded at 8 weeks. The immediate post-treatment flow conditions in aneurysms of each group were quantified using subject-specific computational fluid dynamics and statistically compared. RESULTS: Nine aneurysms were classified into the fast occlusion group and six into the slow occlusion group. Aneurysms in the fast occlusion group were on average significantly smaller (fast=0.9 cm, slow=1.393 cm, p=0.024) and had smaller ostia (fast=0.144 cm2, slow=0.365 cm2, p=0.015) than aneurysms in the slow occlusion group. They also had a lower mean post-treatment inflow rate (fast=0.047 mL/s, slow=0.155 mL/s, p=0.0239), kinetic energy (fast=0.519 erg, slow=1.283 erg, p=0.0468), and velocity (fast=0.221 cm/s, slow=0.506 cm/s, p=0.0582). However, the differences in the latter two variables were only marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic conditions after flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms in rabbits are associated with the subsequent aneurysm occlusion time.

In particular, the assessment of long-term outcome, a primary end point in clinical practice, has been challenging due to mild deficits and the rapid and often complete recovery in most experimental models. We, therefore, sought to develop a focal white-matter infarction model that can mimic the lasting neurologic deficits commonly observed in stroke patients. The potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (n=24) or vehicle (n=9) was stereotactically injected into the internal capsule at one of three antero-posterior levels (1, 2, or 3 mm posterior to bregma) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Endothelin-injected animals showed highly focal (~1 mm(3)) and reproducible ischemic infarcts, with severe axonal and myelin loss accompanied by cellular infiltration when examined 2 and 4 weeks after injection. Only those rats injected with endothelin-1 at the most posterior location developed robust and pure-motor deficits in adhesive removal, cylinder and foot-fault tests that persisted at 1 month, without detectable sensory impairments.

Loss of its activity causes cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), an inherited form of cerebral small vessel disease leading to early-onset stroke and premature dementia. Dysregulated TGF-beta signaling is considered to promote CARASIL pathogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we present evidence from mouse brain tissue and embryonic fibroblasts as well as patient skin fibroblasts for a facilitating role of HtrA1 in TGF-beta pathway activation. We identify latent TGF-beta binding protein 1 (LTBP-1), an extracellular matrix protein and key regulator of TGF-beta bioavailability, as a novel HtrA1 target.

Although epidemiological data from twin and family studies provide substantial evidence for a genetic basis for stroke, the contribution of genetic factors identified so far is small. Large progress has been made in single-gene disorders associated with ischemic stroke, particularly at young age. The identification of NOTCH3 mutations in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and of TREX1 mutations in retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL) have led to new insights on lacunar stroke and small-vessel disease. Studies of sickle-cell disease have drawn attention to the importance of modifier genes and of gene-gene interactions in determining stroke risk, while there is now evidence that Fabry disease is an underdiagnosed cause of stroke. Furthermore, stroke is a well-known complication of several heritable connective tissue disorders, including Marfan's syndrome (FBN1 mutations) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (COL3A1 mutations), which predispose to cervical artery dissection, the most frequent cause of cerebral ischemia at young age. By contrast, little is known about the genes associated with multifactorial stroke. The reported genome-wide association studies of ischemic stroke have shown that no single common genetic variant imparts major risk. Pharmacogenomic studies have uncovered genetic determinants of response to warfarin, statins and clopidogrel. Larger studies with samples numbering in the thousands are ongoing to identify common variants with smaller effects on risk.

Recent studies using transgenic (Tg)Notch3(R169C) mice, a genetic model of CADASIL, revealed functional defects in cerebral (pial) arteries on the surface of the brain at an early stage of disease progression. Here, using parenchymal arterioles (PAs) from within the brain, we determined the molecular mechanism underlying the early functional deficits associated with this Notch3 mutation. At physiological pressure (40 mmHg), smooth muscle membrane potential depolarization and constriction to pressure (myogenic tone) were blunted in PAs from TgNotch3(R169C) mice. This effect was associated with an approximately 60% increase in the number of voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, which oppose pressure-induced depolarization. Inhibition of KV1 channels with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor agonist heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), which promotes KV1 channel endocytosis, reduced KV current density and restored myogenic responses in PAs from TgNotch3(R169C) mice, whereas pharmacological inhibition of other major vasodilatory influences had no effect. KV1 currents and myogenic responses were similarly altered in pial arteries from TgNotch3(R169C) mice, but not in mesenteric arteries. Interestingly, HB-EGF had no effect on mesenteric arteries, suggesting a possible mechanistic basis for the exclusive cerebrovascular manifestation of CADASIL.

However, the temporal profile of vascular changes after stroke is still poorly understood. Here, we optimized steady-state contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (SSCE MRI) and followed the dynamic changes in vascular architecture for up to 4 weeks after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Using MRI diffusion measurements and the changes of transversal relaxation rates DeltaR2 and DeltaR2* after injection of a superparamagnetic contrast agent, SSCE MRI provided several hemodynamic parameters: relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), rCBV in small vessels, microvascular density, and relative vessel size. Six rats underwent SSCE MRI before MCAO and at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after surgery. 5-Bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected between days 2 and 7 to label proliferating cells during this time. SSCE MRI depicted a decrease in microvessel density and an increase in vessel size in the ischemic striatum after stroke. A persistently decreased MRI vessel density was confirmed with histology at 28 days. BrdU + endothelial cells were found in regions close to the infarct indicating endothelial cell proliferation during the first week after MCAO; however, late-stage angiogenesis, as would be reflected by increased vessel density, was not detected.

Automated gait analysis provides a sensitive tool to examine locomotion and limb coordination in small rodents. Comparing mice before and 10 days after experimental stroke (60 min MCAo) we observed a significant decrease in maximum contact area, stride length and swing speed in the hind limbs, especially the contralateral one. Mice showed a disturbed interlimb coordination represented by changes in regularity index and phase dispersion. To assess whether gait analysis is applicable to assess improvements by neuroprotective compounds, we applied a model calculation and approached common statistical problems.

However, the effect of minocycline in hypoxia-induced BBB damage is unclear. Here, we have investigated the effect of minocycline under hypoxia and explored its possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The effect of minocycline was examined in vitro in Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HBMECs) using Trans Epithelial Electric Resistance (TEER). Protein and mRNA expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and tight junction proteins (TJs) were detected by using Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The translocation and transcription of HIF-1alpha were detected by using immunocytochemistry and luciferase reporter assay. In vivo, to adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats under hypobaric hypoxia were administered minocycline for 1h and BBB permeability was tested by using Evans Blue and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Also, reduction of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT-3)/proline hydroxylase-2 (PHD-2) signaling pathway was evaluated. RESULTS: Minocycline increased TEER in HBMECs after hypoxia (P<0.05), and reduced the extravasation of Evans Blue (P<0.05) and colloidal gold nanoparticles in rats. Minocycline administration significantly reduced HIF-1alpha expression, protein and mRNA expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) (P<0.05), and increased TJs (ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding) (P<0.05) in HBMECs after hypoxia. Furthermore, minocycline reversed the hypoxia-induced reduction of PHD-2 (P<0.05) and SIRT-3 (P<0.05). Effects of minocycline were abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT-3 in the brain.

METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was established by the middle cerebral artery occlusion approach. Thirty-six male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 groups: control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Chinese patent medicine (Qing-kai-ling [QKL]), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), combination of iPSCs and QKL, neuronal stem cells (NSCs), and combination of NSCs and QKL. Serial (18)F-FDG small-animal PET imaging and neurofunctional tests were performed weekly. Autoradiographic imaging and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses were performed at 4 wk after stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Compared with the PBS control group, significantly higher (18)F-FDG accumulations in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction were observed in 5 treatment groups from weeks 1-4. Interestingly, the most intensive (18)F-FDG accumulation was found in the NSCs + QKL group at week 1 but in the iPSCs + QKL group at week 4. The neurofunctional scores in the 5 treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the PBS group from week 3 to 4. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the PET imaging findings and neurofunctional recovery (P < 0.05) or glucose transporter-1 expression (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies found that transplanted iPSCs survived and migrated to the ischemic region and expressed protein markers for cells of interest.

The causative gene for CARASIL is HTRA1 (high-temperature requirement A1). HTRA1 is a serine protease and inhibits TGF-beta signaling in their protease activity-dependent manner. The CARASIL-associated mutant HTRA1s lost their protease activity and increase the TGF-beta family signaling. However the precious molecular mechanism for inhibition of TGF-beta signaling by HTRA1 has not been elucidated. We have found that HTRA1 aberrantly cleaved pro-TGF-beta in an endoplasmic reticulum and the cleaved products were degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. The result reconfirms the importance of HTRA1 for TGF-beta signaling. The study for Marfan syndrome, which is caused by the increasing TGF-beta signaling in aortic artery, indicates that the angiotensin I receptor antagonist, a drug already in clinical use for hypertension, inhibits TGF-beta signaling and ameliorates the disease progression in model mouse as well as patients with Marfan syndrome. In human brain, angiotensin I receptor antagonist also inhibits TGF-beta signaling.

However, the mechanism underlying functional recovery after stem cell transplantation has not been fully established and there is still a need to determine the ideal subset of stem cells for such therapy. We herein reviewed the recent evidences showing the underlying mechanism of functional recovery after cell transplantation, focusing on endogenous brain repair. First, angiogenesis/neovascularization is promoted by trophic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor secreted from stem cells, and stem cells migrated to the lesion along with the vessels. Second, axonal sprouting, dendritic branching, and synaptogenesis were enhanced altogether in the both ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere remapping the pyramidal tract across the board. Finally, endogenous neurogenesis was also enhanced although little is known how much these neurogenesis contribute to the functional recovery. Taken together, it is clear that stem cell transplantation provides functional recovery via endogenous repair enhancement from multiple ways.

The results showed that all 12 mice were carried on successfully the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, and the placement of the microcatheter and the mNSCs perfusion were completed smoothly without exception.

The spectrum of neuroradiological manifestations associated with SVD is wide and may result from chronic and diffuse or acute and focal ischemia (leukoaraiosis and lacunar infarction) as well as from small-vessel rupture (cerebral microbleeds and intracerebral hemorrhage). Several lines of evidence from family and twin studies support the hypothesis that genetic factors may contribute to SVD pathogenesis. Identification of genetic susceptibility factors for SVD may improve our knowledge of SVD pathogenesis and help to identify new therapeutic targets to reduce the burden of SVD-related cognitive decline and stroke disability. A number of monogenic conditions presenting with clinical features of SVD have been described. Although monogenic disorders account for only a small proportion of SVD, study of these diseases may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of SVD. In most cases, however, SVD is thought to be a multifactorial disorder. Several genetic association studies, conducted using the candidate gene and, more recently, the genome-wide approach, have so far failed to demonstrate a convincing association between SVD and genetic variants. Methodological issues, particularly related to inaccurate or heterogeneous phenotyping and insufficient sample sizes, have been invoked as possible reasons for this.

Their extent (number and diameter) varies widely among mouse strains and healthy humans. We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7 (Canq1, LOD = 29) responsible for 37% of the heritable variation in collateral extent between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. We sought to identify candidate genes in Canq1 responsible for collateral variation in the cerebral pial circulation, a tissue whose strain-dependent variation is shared by similar variation in other tissues. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Collateral extent was intermediate in a recombinant inbred line that splits Canq1 between the C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains. Phenotyping and SNP-mapping of an expanded panel of twenty-one informative inbred strains narrowed the Canq1 locus, and genome-wide linkage analysis of a SWRxSJL-F2 cross confirmed its haplotype structure. Collateral extent, infarct volume after cerebral artery occlusion, bleeding time, and re-bleeding time did not differ in knockout mice for two vascular-related genes located in Canq1, IL4ra and Itgal.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes affects both large and small vessels in the brain, but the dynamic process and mechanism are unclear. METHODS: We investigated the structural and functional changes of brain vasculature in living hyperglycemic rats and their impact on stroke outcomes via a novel technique: synchrotron radiation angiography. We also examined the effect of prolonged fasudil treatment on arterial reactivity and hemorrhagic transformation. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated by streptozotocin to induce type 1 diabetes. These hyperglycemic rats received fasudil pretreatment and then underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: We found that diabetes caused arteries narrowing in the circus Willis as early as 2 weeks after streptozotocin injection (P < 0.05). These vessels were further constricted after middle cerebral artery occlusion. L-NAME could induce regional constrictions and impaired relaxation in hyperglycemic animals. Furthermore, hemorrhagic transformation was also increased in the hyperglycemic rats compared to the control (P < 0.05). In fasudil-treated rats, the internal carotid artery narrowing was ameliorated and L-NAME-induced regional constriction was abolished. Importantly, stroke prognosis was improved in fasudil-treated rats compared to the control (P < 0.05).

Here, we examine tissue and functional outcome after an ischemic lesion within corpus callosum in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice null for a gene, NOTCH3, linked to white matter ischemic injury in patients. METHODS: WT and NOTCH3 knockout mice were subjected to stereotactic microinjections of the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 at the level of periventricular white matter to induce a focal ischemic lesion. Infarct location was confirmed by MRI, and brains were examined for lesion size and histology; behavioral deficits were assessed </=1 month in WT mice. RESULTS: Ischemic damage featured an early cerebral blood flow deficit, blood-brain barrier opening, and a lesion largely confined to white matter. At later stages, myelin and axonal degeneration and microglial/macrophage infiltration were found. WT mice displayed prolonged cognitive deficit when tested using a novel object recognition task. NOTCH3 mutants showed larger infarcts and greater cognitive deficit at 7 days post stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data show the usefulness of microinjections of endothelin-1 into periventricular white matter to study focal infarcts and cognitive deficit in WT mice.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can repress inflammatory cytokines and show great potential for ischemic stroke therapy. However, the effect of MSCs regarding the protection of ischemia-induced BBB break down is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We test whether MSCs therapy protects BBB integrity and explore the molecular mechanisms of aquaporin-4 on BBB integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight adult CD1 male mice underwent 90 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and received 2 x 10(5) MSCs intracranial transplantation. The neurological severity score was improved and both ischemia-induced brain edema and BBB leakage were reduced in MSC-treated mice. MSCs therapy reduced astrocyte apoptosis and inhibited ischemia-induced aquaporin-4 upregulation. In addition, small-interfering RNA knockdown of aquaporin-4 after cerebral ischemia effectively reduced aquaporin-4 expression, brain edema, BBB leakage, and astrocyte apoptosis. Conditional medium from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia enhanced aquaporin-4 expression, p38 and JNK phosphorylation, and apoptosis of cultured astrocytes. MSC treatment reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-activated microglia, and subsequently reduced aquaporin-4 expression and apoptosis of astrocytes. Knockdown of aquaporin-4 in cultured astrocytes also reduced apoptosis. Treatment with p38 and JNK inhibitors showed that p38, but not the JNK signaling pathway, was responsible for the aquaporin-4 upregulation. CONCLUSION: MSCs protected BBB integrity by reducing the apoptosis of astrocytes after ischemic attack, which was due to the attenuation of inflammatory response and downregulation of aquaporin-4 expression via p38 signaling pathway.",2014,Journal Article,Stem Cells,G.

The disease is caused by highly stereotyped mutations within the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3 receptor (Notch3(ECD)) that result in an odd number of cysteine residues. While CADASIL-associated NOTCH3 mutations differentially affect NOTCH3 receptor function and activity, they all are associated with early accumulation of Notch3(ECD)-containing aggregates in small vessels. We still lack mechanistic explanation to link NOTCH3 mutations with small vessel pathology. Herein, we hypothesized that excess Notch3(ECD) could recruit and sequester functionally important proteins within small vessels of the brain. We performed biochemical, nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical analyses, using cerebral and arterial tissue derived from patients with CADASIL and mouse models of CADASIL that exhibit vascular lesions in the end- and early-stage of the disease, respectively. Biochemical fractionation of brain and artery samples demonstrated that mutant Notch3(ECD) accumulates in disulphide cross-linked detergent-insoluble aggregates in mice and patients with CADASIL. Further proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses identified two functionally important extracellular matrix proteins, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) and vitronectin (VTN) that are sequestered into Notch3(ECD)-containing aggregates. Using cultured cells, we show that increased levels or aggregation of Notch3 enhances the formation of Notch3(ECD)-TIMP3 complex, promoting TIMP3 recruitment and accumulation. In turn, TIMP3 promotes complex formation including NOTCH3 and VTN. In vivo, brain vessels from mice and patients with CADASIL exhibit elevated levels of both insoluble cross-linked and soluble TIMP3 species. Moreover, reverse zymography assays show a significant elevation of TIMP3 activity in the brain vessels from mice and patients with CADASIL. Collectively, our findings lend support to a Notch3(ECD) cascade hypothesis in CADASIL disease pathology, which posits that aggregation/accumulation of Notch3(ECD) in the brain vessels is a central event, promoting the abnormal recruitment of functionally important extracellular matrix proteins that may ultimately cause multifactorial toxicity. Specifically, our results suggest a dysregulation of TIMP3 activity, which could contribute to mutant Notch3(ECD) toxicity by impairing extracellular matrix homeostasis in small vessels.",2013,Journal Article,Brain,M.

Lack of effective treatment and failure of large clinical trials aimed at hemostasis and clot removal demonstrate the need for further mechanism-driven investigation of ICH. This research may be performed through the framework provided by preclinical models. Two murine models in popular use include intrastriatal (basal ganglia) injection of either autologous whole blood or clostridial collagenase. Since, each model represents distinctly different pathophysiological features related to ICH, use of a particular model may be selected based on what aspect of the disease is to be studied. For example, autologous blood injection most accurately represents the brain's response to the presence of intraparenchymal blood, and may most closely replicate lobar hemorrhage. Clostridial collagenase injection most accurately represents the small vessel rupture and hematoma evolution characteristic of deep hemorrhages. Thus, each model results in different hematoma formation, neuroinflammatory response, cerebral edema development, and neurobehavioral outcomes. Robustness of a purported therapeutic intervention can be best assessed using both models. In this protocol, induction of ICH using both models, immediate post-operative demonstration of injury, and early post-operative care techniques are demonstrated. Both models result in reproducible injuries, hematoma volumes, and neurobehavioral deficits.

A retrospective study of dogs with a previous diagnosis of ischaemic stroke diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The association between survival and the hypothesised risk factors was examined using univariable exact logistic regression. Survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Twenty-two dogs were identified. Five dogs (23%) died within the first 30days of the stroke event. Median survival in 30-day survivors was 505days. Four dogs (18%) were still alive by the end of the study. Right-sided lesions posed a significantly increased risk of mortality with a median survival time in dogs with right-sided lesions of 24days vs. 602days in dogs with left sided lesions (P=0.006). Clinical outcome was considered excellent in seven of 17 (41%) 30-day survivors. Another seven 30-day survivors experienced new acute neurological signs within 6-17months of the initial stroke event; in two of those cases a new ischaemic stroke was confirmed by MRI. In conclusion, dogs with ischaemic stroke have a fair to good prognosis in terms of survival and clinical outcome. However, owners should be informed of the risk of acute death within 30days and of the possibility of new neurological events in survivors.

The majority of all strokes result from an interruption in blood flow (ischemia). Middle cerebral artery (MCA) delivers a great majority of blood to the lateral surface of the cortex, is the most common site of human stroke, and ischemia within its territory can result in extensive dysfunction or death. Survivors of ischemic stroke often suffer loss or disruption of motor capabilities, sensory deficits, and infarct. In an effort to capture these key characteristics of stroke, and thereby develop effective treatment, a great deal of emphasis is placed upon animal models of ischemia in MCA. Here we present a method of permanently occluding a cortical surface blood vessel. We will present this method using an example of a relevant vessel occlusion that models the most common type, location, and outcome of human stroke, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). In this model, we surgically expose MCA in the adult rat and subsequently occlude via double ligature and transection of the vessel. This pMCAO blocks the proximal cortical branch of MCA, causing ischemia in all of MCA cortical territory, a large portion of the cortex. This method of occlusion can also be used to occlude more distal portions of cortical vessels in order to achieve more focal ischemia targeting a smaller region of cortex. The primary disadvantages of pMCAO are that the surgical procedure is somewhat invasive as a small craniotomy is required to access MCA, though this results in minimal tissue damage. The primary advantages of this model, however, are: the site of occlusion is well defined, the degree of blood flow reduction is consistent, functional and neurological impairment occurs rapidly, infarct size is consistent, and the high rate of survival allows for long-term chronic assessment.",2013,Journal Article,J Vis Exp,M.

METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion was used to establish cerebral ischemia. Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: iPSC treatment, ESC treatment, and the control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection. After neurologic function tests and baseline (18)F-FDG small-animal PET had been performed, 1.0 x 10(6) suspended iPSCs or ESCs were injected stereotactically into the left lateral ventricle. The treatment response was evaluated weekly by (18)F-FDG PET scans and neurologic function tests. Histologic analyses and autoradiographic imaging were performed 4 wk after stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Compared with the PBS injection group, higher (18)F-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction was observed in both the iPSC and the ESC treatment groups during the 4-wk period (P < 0.05). (18)F-FDG accumulation in the ipsilateral cerebral infarction increased steadily over time in the iPSC treatment group. At 1 and 2 wk after stem cell transplantation, significant recovery of glucose metabolism was found in the ESC treatment group (P < 0.05) and then decreased gradually. The neurologic score in both stem cell-treated groups was significantly lower than that in the PBS group, indicating functional improvement. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that transplanted stem cells survived and migrated close to the ischemic region, and most of the stem cells expressed protein markers for cells of interest. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG small-animal PET demonstrated metabolic recovery after iPSC and ESC transplantation in the rat model of cerebral ischemia. iPSCs could be considered a potentially better therapeutic approach than ESCs and are worthy of further translational investigation.",2013,Journal Article,J Nucl Med,J.

Presently, we induced two lesions of different extents, to assess the consequences of stroke on motor function, locomotion and possible correlations to morphological changes. Behavioral tests sensitive to sensorimotor changes were used; locomotion expressed as distance moved in the open field was monitored and histological changes were also assessed. Outcomes depicted two kinds of lesions of different shapes and sizes, relative to laser illumination. Motor performance of rats submitted to stroke was poor when compared to controls; a difference in motor performance was also noted between rats with small and large lesions.

Pathological changes associated with type II diabetes were investigated using a rat model. Pathophysiological changes in diabetic brain tissue were also investigated to confirm cerebral compliance by analyzing intracranial pressure waveforms. Pathologic findings revealed thickening of the basement membrane and fibrous collagen infiltration into the inner basement membrane of the brain microvasculature in diabetes mellitus. Analysis of intracranial pressure waveforms revealed that the P2 portion increased in diabetic rats compared to the control and was increased further with the increase in intracranial pressure. Analysis of the differential pressure curve, with respect to time, demonstrated that intracranial elasticity showed a concomitant increase.

To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) together with PET and assessed serial changes in cardiac metabolism and function over 7 d. METHODS: Scans of 16 C57BL/6 male mice were obtained using a small-animal PET device under sevoflurane anesthesia. A 10-min transmission scan was followed by a 60-min dynamic (18)F-FDG PET scan with cardiac and respiratory gating. Blood glucose levels were measured before and after the emission scan. TAC and sham surgeries were performed after baseline imaging. Osmotic mini pumps containing either propranolol (5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone were implanted subcutaneously at the end of surgery. Subsequent scans were taken at days 1 and 7 after surgery. A compartment model, in which the blood input function with spillover and partial-volume corrections and the metabolic rate constants in a 3-compartment model are simultaneously estimated, was used to determine the net myocardial (18)F-FDG influx constant, Ki. The rate of myocardial glucose utilization, rMGU, was also computed. Estimations of the ejection fractions were based on the high-resolution gated PET images. RESULTS: Mice undergoing TAC surgery exhibited an increase in the Ki (580%) and glucose utilization the day after surgery, indicating early adaptive response. On day 7, the ejection fraction had decreased by 24%, indicating a maladaptive response. Average Ki increases were not linearly associated with increases in rMGU. Ki exceeded rMGU by 29% in the TAC mice. TAC mice treated with propranolol attenuated the rate of (18)F-FDG uptake, diminished mismatch between Ki and rMGU (9%), and rescued cardiac function. CONCLUSION: Metabolic maladaptation precedes the onset of severe contractile dysfunction. Both are prevented by treatment with propranolol.

Previous studies have suggested that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) is a potential useful tool for cerebral ischemic treatment. However, the protective mechanism of RIPC is not very clear. This study verified the hypothesis that, in remote post-conditioning of cerebral ischemic rats, down-regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is an important player for water hemostasis in astrocytes, could attenuate cerebral damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this study, RIPC model was established after MCAO. Each hind limb of rat was clamped by small rubber tubes for 10 min, and then the tubes were opened for 10 min. The clamping and opening were operated for a total of three cycles to block the hind limbs blood flow. The results showed that, RIPC could significantly improve neurological function, decrease the percentage of the infarct volume and edema, and elevate the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the numbers of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were significantly lower in the RIPC group. Moreover, we found that AQP4 expression decreased in response to ischemia/reperfusion in the RIPC group. Our findings indicated that RIPC could attenuate focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the neuroprotective mechanism was related with the down-regulation of AQP4 in astrocytes.",2015,Journal Article,Behav Brain Res,S.

To gain insight how this lesion influences the motor outcome and responds to rehabilitative training, we used circumscribed photothrombotic capsular infarct models on 36 Sprague-Dawley rats (24 experimental and 12 sham-operated). We used 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-D-glucose-micro positron emission tomography (FDG-microPET) to assess longitudinal changes in resting-state brain activity (rs-BA) and daily single-pellet reaching task (SPRT) trainings to evaluate motor recovery. Longitudinal FDG-microPET results showed that capsular infarct resulted in a persistent decrease in rs-BA in bilateral sensory and auditory cortices, and ipsilesional motor cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus (P<0.0025, false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05). The decreased rs-BA is compatible with diaschisis and contributes to manifest the malfunctions of lesion-specific functional connectivity. In contrast, capsular infarct resulted in increase of rs-BA in the ipsilesional internal capsule, and contralesional red nucleus and ventral hippocampus in recovery group (P<0.0025, FDR q<0.05), implying that remaining subcortical structures have an important role in conducting the recovery process in capsular infarct.

Nissl staining was used to quantify the cortical injury. L-serine and D-serine levels in the ischemic cortex were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography. We found that L-serine treatment: 1) reduced the neurological deficit score, infarct volume and cortical neuron loss in a dose-dependent manner; 2) improved CBF in the cortex, and this effect was inhibited in the presence of apamin plus charybdotoxin while the alleviation of both neurological deficit score and infarct volume was blocked; and 3) increased the amount of L-serine and D-serine in the cortex, and inhibition of the conversion of L-serine into D-serine by aminooxyacetic acid did not affect the reduction of neurological deficit score and infarct volume by L-serine.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate CB(1) and CB(2) receptor binding over time in vivo in a rat photothrombotic stroke model using PET. METHODS: CB(1) and CB(2) microPET imaging was performed at regular time-points up to 2 weeks after stroke using [(18)F]MK-9470 and [(11)C]NE40. Stroke size was measured using MRI at 9.4 T.

RESULTS: [(18)F]MK-9470 PET showed a strong increase in CB(1) binding 24 h and 72 h after stroke in the cortex surrounding the lesion, extending to the insular cortex 24 h after surgery. These alterations were consistently confirmed by CB(1) immunohistochemical staining. [(11)C]NE40 did not show any significant differences between stroke and sham-operated animals, although staining for CB(2) revealed minor immunoreactivity at 1 and 2 weeks after stroke in this model. Both CB (1) (+) and CB (2) (+) cells showed minor immunoreactivity for CD68.

Thus our goal was to examine whether modest ExT could influence transient focal ischemia-induced brain injury along with nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent dilation of cerebral (pial) arterioles during T1D. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: nondiabetic sedentary, nondiabetic ExT, diabetic (streptozotocin; 50 mg/kg ip) sedentary, and diabetic ExT. In the first series of studies, we measured infarct volume in all groups of rats following right MCA occlusion for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. In a second series of studies, a craniotomy was performed over the parietal cortex, and we measured responses of pial arterioles to an endothelial NOS (eNOS)-dependent, a neuronal NOS (nNOS)-dependent, and a NOS-independent agonist in all groups of rats. We found that sedentary diabetic rats had significantly larger total, cortical, and subcortical infarct volumes following ischemia-reperfusion than sedentary nondiabetic, nondiabetic ExT, and diabetic ExT rats. Infarct volumes were similar in sedentary nondiabetic, ExT nondiabetic, and ExT diabetic rats. In contrast, ExT did not alter infarct size in nondiabetic compared with sedentary nondiabetic rats. In addition, ExT diabetic rats had impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent, but not NOS-independent, vasodilation that was restored by ExT. Thus ExT of T1D rats lessened ischemic brain injury following middle cerebral artery occlusion and restored impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent vascular function.

Patients with COL4A1 or COL4A2 mutations suffer from diverse cerebrovascular diseases, including cerebral microbleeds, porencephaly, and fatal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown, and there is a lack of effective treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutant mouse models, we investigated the genetic complexity and cellular mechanisms underlying the disease. We found that Col4a1 mutations cause abnormal vascular development, which triggers small-vessel disease, recurrent hemorrhagic strokes, and age-related macroangiopathy. We showed that allelic heterogeneity, genetic context, and environmental factors such as intense exercise or anticoagulant medication modulated disease severity and contributed to phenotypic heterogeneity. We found that intracellular accumulation of mutant collagen in vascular endothelial cells and pericytes was a key triggering factor of ICH. Finally, we showed that treatment of mutant mice with a US Food and Drug Administration-approved chemical chaperone resulted in a decreased collagen intracellular accumulation and a significant reduction in ICH severity.

The accumulation is systemic but most pronounced in the brain vasculature where it leads to clinical symptoms of recurrent stroke and dementia. There is no therapy for CADASIL, and therapeutic development is hampered by a lack of feasible clinical outcome measures and biomarkers, both in mouse models and in CADASIL patients. To facilitate pre-clinical therapeutic interventions for CADASIL, we aimed to develop a novel, translational CADASIL mouse model. RESULTS: We generated transgenic mice in which we overexpressed the full length human NOTCH3 gene from a genomic construct with the archetypal c.544C > T, p.Arg182Cys mutation. The four mutant strains we generated have respective human NOTCH3 RNA expression levels of 100, 150, 200 and 350 % relative to endogenous mouse Notch3 RNA expression. Immunohistochemistry on brain sections shows characteristic vascular human NOTCH3 accumulation in all four mutant strains, with human NOTCH3 RNA expression levels correlating with age at onset and progression of NOTCH3 accumulation. This finding was the basis for developing the 'NOTCH3 score', a quantitative measure for the NOTCH3 accumulation load. This score proved to be a robust and sensitive method to assess the progression of NOTCH3 accumulation, and a feasible biomarker for pre-clinical therapeutic testing. CONCLUSIONS: This novel, translational CADASIL mouse model is a suitable model for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying or reversing NOTCH3 accumulation, using the NOTCH3 score as a biomarker.",2015,Journal Article,Acta Neuropathol Commun,J.

T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with a T2*oxygen challenge (T2*OC) is being developed to detect penumbra based on changes in blood deoxyhemoglobin. Using 100% O2, T2*OC-defined penumbra exhibits ongoing glucose metabolism and tissue recovery on reperfusion. However, potential limitations in translating this technique include a sinus artefact in human scans with delivery of 100% OC and relatively small signal changes. Here we investigate whether an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion can enhance the sensitivity of the technique, enabling penumbra detection with lower levels of inspired oxygen. Stroke was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=17) with ischemic injury and perfusion deficit determined by diffusion and perfusion MRI, respectively. T2* signal change was measured in regions of interest (ROIs) located within ischemic core, T2*OC-defined penumbra and equivalent contralateral areas during 40% O2+/-prior PFC injection. Region of interest analyses between groups showed that PFC significantly enhanced the T2* response to 40% O2 in T2*-defined penumbra (mean increase of 10.6+/-2.3% compared to 5.6+/-1.5% with 40% O2, P<0.001). This enhancement was specific to the penumbra ROI. Perfluorocarbon emulsions therefore enhances the translational potential of the T2*OC technique for identifying penumbra in acute stroke patients.",2013,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,G. A.

We introduce a new mCT imaging technique with improved sensitivity for the dynamic spatial and temporal characterization of poststroke blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in small animals in vivo. METHODS: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced for 1 hour in 10- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice (n=35). At 4, 24, and 48 hours after ischemic stroke, serial in vivo mCT imaging was performed 5 minutes after intravenous infusion (n=3) or intracarotid infusion of iopromide (240 muL) for 5 minutes (n=32). After intravenous injection of 2% Evans blue, we performed ex vivo near-infrared fluorescent imaging of parenchymal Evans blue leakage, visual assessment of poststroke parenchymal hematoma, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of the brain tissue, and quantitative mapping of stroke-related brain lesions. RESULTS: Infarct-related BBB dysfunction could be demonstrated with intra-arterial but not with intravenous infusion of iopromide. Iopromide leakage across the dysfunctional BBB showed a monophasic (not biphasic) course for 48 hours after ischemic insult in both the parenchymal hematoma (n=5) and the non-parenchymal hematoma (n=24) groups, with relatively severe leakiness and greater hemispheric midline shift in animals with hemorrhage. Parenchymal staining on in vivo mCT overlapped with ex vivo fluorescent staining because of Evans blue. Multivariable analyses showed that midline shift and the amount of iopromide leakage at each of the 3 time points predicted the final infarct size at 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The new mCT BBB imaging technique, based on the intra-arterial infusion of clinically available iopromide, allows serial quantitative visualization of poststroke BBB dysfunction in mice, with high resolution and in a sensitive manner.",2014,Journal Article,Stroke,J.

BACKGROUND: Derangement of miRNAs is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Because the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway plays a regulatory role in endothelial functions, miRNAs targeted at TGF-beta signal cascade might affect vascular health. METHODS: Bioinformatics software predicted that Let-7g can influence the TGF-beta pathway by targeting 3 genes. The Let-7g's effects on multiple endothelial functions were first tested in endothelial cells (ECs) and then in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Blood samples from lacunar stroke patients were also examined to further support Let-7g's effects on human subjects. RESULTS: Let-7g was experimentally confirmed to knock down the THBS1, TGFBR1, and SMAD2 genes in the TGF-beta pathway. PAI-I, one of the downstream effectors of the TGF-beta pathway, was also down-regulated by Let-7g. Let-7g decreased EC inflammation and monocyte adhesion and increased angiogenesis via the TGF-beta pathway. Furthermore, Let-7g reduced EC senescence through increasing SIRT-1 protein. Venous injection of Let-7g inhibitor into apolipoprotein E knockout mice caused overgrowth of vascular intima-media, overexpression of PAI-1, increased macrophage infiltration, and up-regulation of TGF-beta downstream genes in the carotid arteries. Let-7g's beneficial effects on EC were reduced, whereas the TGF-beta pathway was suppressed by ribonucleic acid interference. Restoration of the TGF-beta pathway also attenuated the effects of Let-7g overexpression. Low serum levels of Let-7g were associated with increased circulating PAI-1 levels.

METHODS: Dogs were assigned to a heat stroke (control) or heat stroke + hemofiltration (HF) group (n = 8 each group). After heat stroke induction, dogs in the HF group received HF for 3 h. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were measured at baseline and 1, 2, and 3 h after heat stroke. Clearance rates of solutes were determined 1, 2, and 3 h after the start of HF. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of all solutes tended to increase with time after heat stroke in the control group, but decreased (BUN, creatinine) or remained relatively unchanged (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10) with time in the HF group. Concentrations of all solutes were significantly lower in the HF group compared with the control group at 2 and 3 h (P < 0.05). Clearance rates for small molecular weight solutes were high, while those for larger molecular weight solutes were low.

The present study analyses whether TREK-1, a two-pore domain K(+) channel and target for volatile anaesthetics, plays a role in mediating neuroprotection by sevoflurane. METHODS: Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were preconditioning with sevoflurane and challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Cell viability and expression of caspase-3 and TREK-1 were evaluated. Rats that were preconditioned with sevoflurane were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the expression of TREK-1 protein and mRNA was analysed. Neurological scores were evaluated and infarction volume was examined. RESULTS: Sevoflurane preconditioning reduced cell death in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells challenged by OGD. Sevoflurane preconditioning reduced infarct volume and improved neurological outcome in rats subjected to MCAO. Sevoflurane preconditioning increased levels of TREK-1 mRNA and protein. Knockdown of TREK-1 significantly attenuated sevoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo.

Different mechanisms contribute to secondary neuronal injury after ICH. This multimodal monitoring study investigated early changes in the PHZ of ICH. METHODS: Twenty-four swine were anesthetized, ventilated, and underwent monitoring of vital parameters. Next to an intracranial pressure-probe (ICP), microdialysis (MD), thermodiffusion cerebral blood flow (td-CBF), and oxygen probes (PbrO2) were placed into the gray white matter junction for 12 h of monitoring. ICH was induced using the autologous blood injection model. Pre-defined volumes were 0 ml (sham), 1.5 ml ipsilateral (1.5 ml), 3.0 ml ipsilateral (3.0 ml), and 3.0 ml contralateral (3.0 ml contra). RESULTS: ICP equally increased in all groups after ICH. In the 3.0 ml group tissue oxygenation decreased to ischemic values of 9 +/- 7 mmHg early after 6 h of monitoring. This decrease was associated with a significant perfusion reduction from 36 +/- 8 ml/100 g/min to 20 +/- 10 ml/100 g/min. MD correlated with a threefold lactate/pyruvate ratio increase. Measurements in all other groups were unchanged.

Stroke may directly damage limbic circuitry resulting in an impaired stress response, however the possibility that this may in part explain the prevalence of stroke comorbidity with mood disorders has yet to be determined. Here we systematically examine psychosocial consequences of prefrontal lesions targeting the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using hormone assays and a behavioral test battery in adult rats to probe whether a small stroke could alter stress behavior or response to psychosocial stress (chronic mild stress (CMS) or subordination stress). Minor stroke produced chronic hyperactivity in an open field but did not alter fear-related inhibition in the elevated plus maze. Novelty-induced defecation was increased by the combination of CMS, subordination and stroke. Anterior cingulate lesions alone increased distress vocalizations in the water maze. Interestingly, ACC stroke caused hyper-secretion of porphyrin and long-term hormonal alterations that resulted in adrenal hypertrophy and enhanced dexamethasone suppression of the HPA axis. We propose that this behavioral profile is consistent with an animal model of post-stroke distress-like syndrome which could be useful in understanding how stroke affects the capacity to cope with psychological stress.",2014,Journal Article,Exp Neurol,K.

We hypothesized that spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR/SP) fed a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) and subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO), a model to study VCI, would lead to reduced tissue oxygen (pO(2)) in the deep WM. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring WM tissue pO(2) using in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry in SHR/SP rats over weeks before and after JPD/UCAO. The SHR/SP rats experienced an increase in WM pO(2) from 9 to 12 weeks with a maximal 32% increase at week 12, followed by a dramatic decrease in WM pO(2) to near hypoxic conditions during weeks 13 to 16 after JPD/UCAO. The decreased WM pO(2) was accompanied with WM damage and hemorrhages surrounding microvessels.

This includes activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of this study was to investigate the very early responses of these systems. METHODS: A porcine animal model of aneurysmal SAH was used. In this model, blood is injected slowly to the basal cisterns above the anterior skull base until the cerebral perfusion pressure is 0 mm Hg. Sampling was done from blood and urine at -10, +15, +75 and +135 minutes from time of induction of SAH. Analyses of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, aldosterone, catecholamines and chromogranin-A were performed. RESULTS: Plasma ACTH, serum cortisol and plasma aldosterone increased in the samples following induction of SAH, and started to decline after 75 minutes. Urine cortisol also increased after SAH. Urine catecholamines and their metabolites were found to increase after SAH. Many samples were however below detection level, not allowing for statistical analysis. Plasma chromogranin-A peaked at 15 minutes after SAH, and thereafter decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The endocrine stress response after aneurysmal SAH was found to start within 15 minutes in the HPA axis with early peak values of ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone. The fact that the concentrations of the HPA axis hormones decreased 135 minutes after SAH may suggest that a similar pattern exists in SAH patients, thus making it difficult to catch these early peak values. There were also indications of early activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but the small number of valid samples made interpretation difficult.",2016,Journal Article,PLoS One,C.

The existing controversies include whether the embolisms can indeed cause lacunar stroke in humans or animal models. We hypothesized that lacunar infarction can be induced by the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) segmental occlusion involving the orifices of lenticulostriate arteries in animal models, which have abundant distal cerebral collateral anastomosis. Our work here establishes a proximal MCA occlusion model using thrombi (autologous blood clots about 1.7 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length) in 8 beagle dogs, evaluates the progression of ischemic lesions at 30 min interval within 6 h after embolization using the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and discusses the potential mechanisms of lacunar infarction. Our results indicate that the left proximal MCAs can be successfully occluded in all dogs using interventional single-thrombus method. The small solitary or multiple ischemic lesions shown in DWI were observed in the deep brain area, with the mean detecting time of 1.21 +/- 0.45 h using DWI and diameter of 6.62 +/- 0.60mm in 6h-DWI after procedure.

OBJECTIVE: To increase basic understanding of robot-mediated neurorehabilitation by performing experiments on a rodent model of stroke. METHODS: Mice were trained to pull back a handle on a robotic platform and their performances in the task were evaluated before and after a focal cortical ischemic stroke. The platform was designed for the quantitative assessment of forelimb function via a series of parameters (time needed to complete the task, t-target; average force; number of sub-movements). RESULTS: The animals rapidly learned the retraction task and reached asymptotic performance by the fifth session of training. Within 2 to 6 days after a small, endothelin-1-induced lesion in the caudal forelimb area, mice showed an increase in t-target and number of sub-movements and a corresponding decrease in the average force exerted. These parameters returned to baseline, pre-lesion values with continued platform training (10-14 days after stroke).

CMBs on paramagnetic-sensitive magnetic resonance sequences correspond pathologically to clusters of hemosiderin-laden macrophages and have emerged as an important new imaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The prevalence of CMBs varies according to the specific disease settings (stroke subtypes and dementing disorders) and is highest (60%) in ICH patients. The associations of CMBs with aging, hypertension and apolipoprotein E genotype are consistent with the two major underlying pathogeneses of CMBs: hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The distributional patterns of CMBs might help us to understand the predominant small vessel disease pathogenesis in the brain; the strictly lobar type of CMBs often reflects the presence of advanced CAA, while the other types of CMBs, such as 'deep or infratentorial CMBs', including the mixed type, are strongly associated with hypertension. CMBs might be associated with cognitive function (especially executive function), gait performance, and cerebrovascular events (spontaneous, antithrombotic drug-related or post-thrombolysis ICH).

We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of mTOR would increase infarct size and decrease microregional O2 supply/consumption balance after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. This was tested in isoflurane-anesthetized rats with middle cerebral artery blockade for 1h and reperfusion for 2h with and without rapamycin (20mg/kg once daily for two days prior to ischemia). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C(14)-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small-vessel arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. The control ischemic-reperfused cortex had a similar blood flow and O2 consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O2 supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic-reperfused cortex. Rapamycin significantly increased cerebral O2 consumption and further reduced O2 supply/consumption balance in the reperfused area. This was associated with an increased cortical infarct size (13.5+/-0.8% control vs. 21.5+/-0.9% rapamycin). We also found that ischemia-reperfusion increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation, while rapamycin decreased this phosphorylation in both the control and ischemic-reperfused cortex.

The complex mechanisms via which blast injury causes impairment of cognition and other symptoms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of varying degrees of primary blast overpressure (BOP; 80 and 200 kPa) on the pathophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes and neurocognitive performance as assessed by the monkey Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (mCANTAB) in non-human primates (NHP). The study aimed to examine the effects of neurobehavioral and histopathological changes in NHP. MRI and histopathology revealed ultrastructural changes in the brain, notably in the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, which were most vulnerable to the blast. The results correlated well with the behavioral changes and changes in motor coordination and working memory of the affected monkeys. In addition, there was white matter damage affecting myelinated axons, astrocytic hypertrophy, and increased aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) expression in astrocytes, suggesting cerebral edema.

TIA was induced by injecting designed temperature-sensitive melted solid lipid microparticles with a melting point around body temperature into male Wistar rats via arterial cannulation. Neurologic deficit was monitored immediately after the injection without anesthesia. According to the clinical definition of TIA, rats were divided into neurologic symptom durations <24-h, 24-48-h and >/=48-h groups. The lipid microparticle-induced infarct volumes were small in the <24-h and 24-48-h groups, while the volumes were five times larger in the >/=48-h group. Permanent ischemic stroke was induced 3d after the induction of TIA by injecting a different kind of embolic particle manufactured by blending chitin and PLGA. The <24-h group had less severe neurologic deficits and smaller infarct volumes than that of 24-48-h and control (without prior lipid microparticle treatment) rats. Taken together, we successfully develop a TIA animal model which allows us to monitor the neurologic deficit in real-time.

SUMO-specific proteases 3 (SENP3), a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier specific protease family, was identified as an isopeptidase that deconjugates SUMOylation (The covalent modification by SUMO) of modified protein substrates. It is reported that SUMO-2/3 conjugation, a member of SUMOylation, presented neuroprotection. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of SENP3 and to explore its potential role in SAH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 108 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 2 parts experiment and 9 subgroups (part 1:Sham group, SAH group, SAH+NAC group, SAH+vehicle group; part 2: Sham group, SAH group, SAH+lv-SENP3 group, SAH+lv-null group, SAH+NS group). 7 days before SAH, lentivirus was administrated into rats left lateral ventricle to down-regulate SENP3. Experimental SAH was imitated by injection with 0.3ml nonheparinized autoblood into the prechiasmatic cistern. MDA levels, SOD activities, and GSH contents were detected to evaluate oxidative stress level. SENP3 and cleaved caspase 3 were detected by western blot, apoptosis was observed by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: High oxidative stress level following SAH induced rising of SENP3. And inhibition of SENP3 by lentivirus induces suppression of apoptosis in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats.

Despite this prevalence, mechanisms of long-term injury and repair within the ischemic brain are still understudied. Sterile inflammation occurs in the injured brain after stroke, with damaged tissue exposing central nervous system (CNS)-derived antigen that could initiate potential autoimmune responses. We used a standard immunology-based recall response assay for murine immune cells, isolated from the cervical lymph nodes and spleen after transient stroke, to determine if stroke induces autoreactivity to CNS target antigens. Our assays included novel neuronal peptides, in addition to myelin-, nuclear-, glial-, and endothelial-derived peptides. Autoimmune responses to an antigen were considered positive based on proliferation and activation over non-stimulated conditions. Stroke induced a significant increase in autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as autoreactive CD19+ B cells, as early as 4 days after stroke onset. Mice with large infarct volumes exhibited early T and B cell autoreactivity to NR2A, an NMDA receptor subunit, in cells isolated from lymph nodes but not spleen. Mice with small infarct volumes exhibited high autoreactivity to MAP2, a dendritic cytoskeletal protein, as well as myelin-derived peptides. This autoimmunity was maintained through 10 days post-stroke in both lymph nodes and spleen for all lymphocyte subsets. Sham surgery also induced early autoreactive B cell responses to MAP2 and myelin. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that stroke induces a secondary, complex, and dynamic autoimmune response to neuronal antigens with the potential to potentiate, or perhaps even ameliorate, long-term neuroinflammation.",2015,Journal Article,Discov Med,S.

Endothelin-1 was used to create a focal lesion in the shoulder/elbow representation of left primary motor cortex (M1) of two adult female macaques. Repetitive microstimulation was used to map upper limb motor outputs from right and left cortical motor areas and from the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF). In subject 1 with a small lesion and spontaneous recovery, reaching was mildly impaired. Changes were evident in the shoulder/elbow representations of both the lesioned and contralesional M1, and there appeared to be fewer than expected upper limb responses from the left (ipsilesional) PMRF. In subject 2 with a substantial lesion, reaching was severely impaired immediately after the lesion. After 12 weeks of intensive rehabilitative training, reach performance recovered to near-baseline levels, but movement times remained about 50% slower. Surprisingly, the shoulder/elbow representation in the lesioned M1 remained completely absent after recovery, and there was a little change in the contralesional M1. There was a definite difference in motor output patterns for left versus right PMRF for this subject, with an increase in right arm responses from right PMRF and a paucity of left arm responses from left PMRF.

In this prospective study we employed MICROFIL(R), a polymer, which was used to fill the entire arterial tree, to examine the incidence of microaneurysm formation following right common carotid artery (RCCA) ligation in rabbits. METHODS: RCCA ligation was performed in 18 New Zealand White rabbits for 0 day (n = 2), 3 weeks (n = 6), or 16 weeks (n = 10). Three control rabbits without carotid surgery were sacrificed at 4 weeks. At the time of sacrifice, MICROFIL(R) MV-122 yellow was injected through left CCA to fill cerebral vasculature. After gross photographs were taken, specimens were embedded, sectioned, and stained for histopathological evaluation. Tissue and sections were carefully evaluated for microaneurysm formation, defined as a localized dilatation of the vessel wall, associated with fragmentation or complete loss of the internal elastic lamina (IEL), and/or medial degeneration. RESULTS: Gross examination with MICROFIL(R) opacification demonstrated no evidence of saccular aneurysm formation, but prominent perforating vessels were present in all 19 cases at, or adjacent to, the basilar terminus. Branches noted upon gross examination corresponded histologically to small, saccular contour defects, which demonstrated apparent loss of the IEL and apparent medial thinning. These observations, however, were a consequence of sectioning through the bases of perforating arteries, which simulated microaneurysm formation. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral carotid ligation does not induce microaneurysm formation at the basilar terminus in rabbits. Prominent perforating arteries as well as tissue injury from the processing may simulate ""aneurysms"" histologically.",2013,Journal Article,Neuroradiology,D.

This study aimed to characterize the model by multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate its potential role for the future stroke research. METHODS: The left proximal MCA was embolized with an autologous thrombus in six beagles. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) were performed every half hour during the first six hours after occlusion, followed by three time points at 12 hours, 24 hours, and one week. Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were carried out at six hours, 24 hours and one week. The PWI-DWI mismatch ratio was defined as (PWI-DWI)/DWI ischemic volume. RESULTS: Lacunar infarcts induced by MCA occlusion were located in the left caudate nucleus and internal capsule. All the lesions could be detected within two hours by DWI. Lesion volume on DWI increased in a time dependent manner, from (87.19 +/- 67.16) mm(3) at one hour up to (368.98 +/- 217.05) mm(3) at 24 hours (P = 0.009), while that on PWI gradually decreased from (7315.00 +/- 2054.38) mm(3) at six hours to (4900.33 +/- 1319.71) mm(3) at 24 hours and (3334.33 +/- 1195.11) mm(3) at one week (P = 0.002). The mismatch ratio was 41.93 +/- 22.75 at six hours after ischemia, showing ""extensive mismatch"", and decreased to 18.10 +/- 13.74 at 24 hours (P = 0.002). No MCA recanalization was observed within 24 hours after MCA occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Lacunar infarction induced by proximal MCA occlusion could be detected early by DWI and was characterized by extensive PWI-DWI mismatch. Multimodal MRI is useful to demonstrate the natural evolution of PWI-DWI mismatch.

Pathology is manifested in small- and middle-sized arteries throughout the body, though primarily in cerebral white matter. Hemodynamics is altered in CADASIL and NOTCH3 is suggested to regulate actin filament polymerization and thereby vascular tone. We analyzed NOTCH3 expression and morphology of actin cytoskeleton in genetically genuine cultured human CADASIL vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (including a cell line homozygous for p.Arg133Cys mutation) derived from different organs, and in control VSMCs with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-silenced NOTCH3. NOTCH3 protein level was higher in VSMCs derived from adult than newborn arteries in both CADASIL and control VSMCs. CADASIL VSMCs showed altered actin cytoskeleton including increased branching and node formation, and more numerous and smaller adhesion sites than control VSMCs. Alterations in actin cytoskeleton in shRNA-silenced VSMCs were similar as in CADASIL VSMCs. Severity of the alterations in actin filaments corresponded to NOTCH3 expression level being most severe in VSMCs derived from adult cerebral arteries. These observations suggest that hypomorphic NOTCH3 activity causes alterations in actin organization in CADASIL. Furthermore, arteries from different organs have specific characteristics, which modify the effects of the NOTCH3 mutation and which is one explanation for the exceptional susceptibility of cerebral white matter arteries.",2012,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,S.

Therefore, we investigated the role of TOPK in experimental stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and reperfusion, and TOPK small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered by intracerebroventricular injection at the beginning of MCAO. After TOPK overexpression and H2O2 stimulation in PC12 neuronal cells, antioxidative proteins, apoptosis-related proteins and signal pathways were detected by western blot analysis, the levels of the peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine) were measured with ELISA. Phosphorylation of TOPK was increased in rat cortical neurons following tMCAO. TOPK overexpression in PC12 cells augmented levels of antioxidative proteins (peroxiredoxin 1 and 2, heme oxygenase 1 and manganese superoxide dismutase), as well as total superoxide dismutase activity, along with inhibition of malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine upon H2O2 stimulation. TOPK overexpression increased cell viability and reduced expression of caspase 3 and caspase 12 in PC12 cells in response to H2O2 . The p-ERK level was increased by TOPK overexpression, and antioxidative protection afforded by TOPK was abolished by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells. TOPK siRNA increased the infarct volume and reduced total superoxide dismutase activity in the cortex in vivo after MCAO. These data reveal that activating TOPK confers neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by antioxidative function, in part through activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.",2014,Journal Article,FEBS J,H.

MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is an archetypal member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP) family, which inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) including JNK through dephosphorylation. MKP-1, one of immediate early genes in stress conditions, was induced at transcriptional level in hypoxia/re-oxygenation (H/R) in neuroblastoma N1E115 cells, however the activation of JNK was not suppressed in the acute phase of re-oxygenation. Small interference RNA-mediated knock-down of MKP-1 enhanced phospho-JNK and neuronal death that is rescued by JNK inhibitor in H/R. Conversely, conditional over-expression of MKP-1 suppressed phospho-JNK, the expression of proapoptotic genes, and neuronal death in H/R. Further the immunoreactivity of MKP-1 was detected in the neurons and partially co-localized with that of phospho-JNK in the surrounding zone of ischemia in rat MCA-O (middle cerebral artery occlusion) reperfusion model.

They have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders making them an attractive drug target. However, due to considerable side effects, the agonist baclofen is so far the only drug on the market targeting GABAB receptors, primarily for the treatment of spasticity. Because GABAB receptors are involved in a variety of brain functions it is rather unlikely to avoid unwanted effects with systemically administered drugs directly addressing ligand binding sites of the receptor. To minimize side effects, it would be desirable to target only those receptors involved in a given pathological state. This commentary discusses the idea that restoring impaired GABAB receptor function in diseased neurons by interfering with receptor-protein interactions may be an approach to specifically target only those receptors involved in the pathological state. Two recently discovered mechanisms that down-regulate the level of functional GABAB receptors most likely contribute to cerebral ischemia and neuropathic pain, respectively. In both mechanisms, small interfering peptides disrupting protein-protein interactions may offer a highly specific means to restore normal receptor function selectively at the site of malfunction. If restored functional GABAB receptor expression in these diseases has beneficial effects, this may serve as a starting point for the development of a highly specific therapeutic interventions. Such an approach is expected to minimize side effects because it promises to leave those GABAB receptors unaffected which are not involved in the dysfunction.",2013,Journal Article,Biochem Pharmacol,D.

In search for new therapeutic drugs, the herbs used in traditional medicines for neurogenesis are promising candidates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected a total of 45 natural compounds from Traditional Chinese herbal medicines which are extensively used in China to treat stroke clinically, and tested their proliferation-inducing activities on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). The screening results showed that salvianolic acid B (Sal B) displayed marked effects on the induction of proliferation of NSPCs. We further demonstrated that Sal B promoted NSPCs proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners. To explore the molecular mechanism, PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and Notch signaling pathways were investigated. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that Ly294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor), but neither U0126 (ERK inhibitor) nor DAPT (Notch inhibitor) inhibited the Sal B-induced proliferation of cells. Western Blotting results showed that stimulation of NSPCs with Sal B enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, and Ly294002 abolished this effect, confirming the role of Akt in Sal B mediated proliferation of NSPCs. Rats exposed to transient cerebral ischemia were treated for 4 weeks with Sal B from the 7th day after stroke. BrdU incorporation assay results showed that exposure Sal B could maintain the proliferation of NSPCs after cerebral ischemia. Morris water maze test showed that delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats. SIGNIFICANCE: Sal B could maintain the NSPCs self-renew and promote proliferation, which was mediated by PI3K/Akt signal pathway. And delayed post-ischemic treatment with Sal B improved cognitive impairment after stroke in rats.

In humans, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) initiates fibrinolysis and activates endoluminal-endothelial receptors; dysfunction of the t-PA inhibitor (PAI-1) results in recurrent hemorrhages. We used PAI-1 knockout (PAI-1) mice to examine the role of t-PA in age-dependent intracranial hemorrhages as a possible model of preterm ICH/IVH. Intracortical injection of 2 muL of phosphate-buffered saline produced a small traumatic injury and a high rate of hemorrhage in PAI-1 pups at postnatal day 3 (P3) or P5, whereas it had no effect in wild-type neonates. This resulted in white matter and cortical lesions, ventricle enlargement, hyperlocomotion, and altered cortical levels of serotonin and dopamine in the adult PAI mice. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers, plasmin- and matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors reduced hemorrhage and tissue lesions. In contrast to P3 to P5, no significant hemorrhages were induced in P10 PAI-1 pups and there were no behavioral or neurochemical alterations in adulthood. These data suggest that microvascular immaturity up to P5 in mice is a determinant factor required for t-PA-dependent vascular rupture.

More than half of the world's population are living in areas associated with high environmental heat especially during the summer seasons. Thus, new research is needed using novel drug targets to achieve neuroprotection in heat-induced brain pathology. Previous research from our laboratory showed that the pathophysiology of brain injuries following heat stroke are exacerbated by chronic intoxication of engineered nanoparticles of small sizes (50-60 nm) following identical heat exposure in rats. Interestingly, in nanoparticle-intoxicated animals the known neuroprotective agents in standard doses failed to induce effective neuroprotection. This suggests that the dose-response of the drugs either requires modification or new therapeutic agents are needed to provide better neuroprotection in nanoparticle-intoxicated animals after heat stroke. This review is focused on the use of cerebrolysin, a mixture of several neurotrophic factors and active peptide fragments, in relation to other neuroprotective agents normally used to treat ischemic stroke in clinics in nanoparticle-induced exacerbation of brain damage in heat stroke. It appears that cerebrolysin exerts the most superior neuroprotective effects in heat stress as compared to other neuroprotective agents on brain pathology in normal rats. Interestingly, to induce effective neuroprotection in nanoparticle-induced exacerbation of brain pathology a double dose of cerebrolysin is needed. On the other hand, double doses of the other drugs were quite ineffective in reducing brain damage. These observations suggest that the drug type and doses are important factors in attenuating nanoparticle-induced exacerbation of brain pathology in heat stroke.

Sumoylation enzymes and substrates are expressed also at the plasma membrane level. Among the numerous plasma membrane proteins controlling ionic homeostasis during cerebral ischemia, 1 of the 3 brain sodium/calcium exchangers (NCX3), exerts a protective role during ischemic preconditioning. In this study, we evaluated whether NCX3 is a target for sumoylation and whether this posttranslational modification participates in ischemic preconditioning-induced neuroprotection. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed (1) SUMO1 conjugation pattern after ischemic preconditioning; (2) the effect of SUMO1 knockdown on the ischemic damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and ischemic preconditioning, (3) the possible interaction between SUMO1 and NCX3 and (4) the molecular determinants of NCX3 sequence responsible for sumoylation. METHODS: Focal brain ischemia and ischemic preconditioning were induced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion. SUMOylation was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry. SUMO1 and NCX3 interaction was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: We found that (1) SUMO1 knockdown worsened ischemic damage and reduced the protective effect of preconditioning; (2) SUMO1 bound to NCX3 at lysine residue 590, and its silencing increased NCX3 degradation; and (3) NCX3 sumoylation participates in SUMO1 protective role during ischemic preconditioning. Thus, our results demonstrate that NCX3 sumoylation confers additional neuroprotection in ischemic preconditioning.

Among potential neuroprotective molecules, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is a strong cell death suppressor. To assess the neuroprotective effects of HSP27 in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we purified a ""physiological"" HSP27 (hHSP27) from normal human lymphocytes. hHSP27 differed from recombinant HSP27 in that it formed dimeric, tetrameric, and multimeric complexes, was phosphorylated, and contained small amounts of alphabeta-crystallin and HSP20. Mice received intravenous injections of hHSP27 following focal cerebral ischemia. Infarct volume, neurological deficit scores, physiological parameters, and immunohistochemical analyses were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion. Intravenous injections of hHSP27 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct size and improved neurological deficits. Injected hHSP27 was localized in neurons on the ischemic side of the brain. hHSP27 suppressed neuronal cell death resulting from cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27), which was artificially expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and dephosphorylated hHSP27 did not have brain protective effects, suggesting that the phosphorylation of hHSP27 may be important for neuroprotection after ischemic insults.

We have recently shown that acute brain injury, such as neurotrauma and stroke, results in perivascular accumulation of the neuropeptide, substance P. This accumulation is associated with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and formation of vasogenic edema. Administration of a substance P antagonist targeting the tachykinin NK1 receptor profoundly reduced the increased blood-brain barrier permeability and edema formation, and in small animal models of acute brain injury, improved functional outcome. In a large, ovine model of experimental traumatic brain injury, trauma resulted in a significant increase in ICP. Administration of an NK1 antagonist caused a profound reduction in post--traumatic ICP, with levels returning to normal within 4 h of drug administration.

This study is to estimate the potential role of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: In vivo, 228 Sprague-Dawley rats were used. An experimental SAH model was induced by single blood injection to prechiasmatic cistern. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxyhemoglobin to mimic SAH in vitro. Specific small interfering RNAs and expression plasmids for neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 were exploited both in vivo and in vitro. Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, neurological scoring, and Morris water maze were performed to evaluate the mechanism of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1, as well as neurological outcome. RESULTS: Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed SAH-induced decrease in the expressions of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 and the interaction between neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 in neurons. In addition, the interaction between neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 was reduced by their knockdown and increased by their overexpression. The formation of excitatory synapses was inhibited by oxyhemoglobin treatment, which was significantly ameliorated by overexpression of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 and aggravated by the knockdown of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1. More importantly, neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 overexpression ameliorated SAH-induced cognitive dysfunction, whereas neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 knockdown induced an opposite effect. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the expressions of neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 could promote the interaction between them and the formation of excitatory synapses, which is helpful to improve cognitive dysfunction after SAH. Neurexin-1beta and neuroligin-1 might be good targets for improving cognitive function after SAH.",2015,Journal Article,Stroke,H.

We currently show that focal ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult mice significantly induces cortical protein ISGylation between 6 and 24 hours reperfusion. With two-dimensional western blotting, 45 proteins were observed to be significantly increased in ISGylation (by 1.8- to 9.7-fold) after focal ischemia compared with sham control. Immunochemistry showed that ISGylated proteins are localized in neurons within the ipsilateral striatum and in astroglia within the peri-infarct cortex of ischemic mice. When subjected to transient MCAO, ISG15(-/-) mice showed increased mortality, exacerbated infarction, and worsened neurologic recovery than did wild-type controls. In addition, mice lacking UBE1L (ub-activating enzyme E1-like protein, the first enzyme of the ISGylation cycle) also showed bigger infarcts when subjected to transient MCAO. Regional cerebral blood flow or other physiologic parameters were not significantly different in both knockouts compared with wild-type controls.

Histamine showed neuroprotection at early stage after cerebral ischemia, however, its long-term effect, especially on glial scar formation, hasn't been characterized. With various administration regimens constructed for histidine, a precursor of histamine, we found that histidine treatment at a high dose at early stage and a low dose at late stage demonstrated the most remarkable long-term neuroprotection with decreased infarct volume and improved neurological function. Notably, this treatment regimen also robustly reduced the glial scar area and facilitated the astrocyte migration towards the infarct core. In wound-healing assay and transwell test, histamine significantly promoted astrocyte migration. H2 receptor antagonists reversed the promotion of astrocyte migration and the neuroprotection provided by histidine. Moreover, histamine upregulated the GTP-bound small GTPase Rac1, while a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, abrogated the neuroprotection of histidine and its promotion of astrocyte migration. Our data indicated that a dose/stage-dependent histidine treatment, mediated by H2 receptor, promoted astrocyte migration towards the infarct core, which benefited long-term post-cerebral ischemia neurological recovery.

Thrombectomy is also increasingly used to treat proximal occlusions of the cerebral arteries, but has not shown superiority over systemic thrombolysis with alteplase. Many patients with acute ischaemic stroke are pretreated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, which can increase the bleeding risk of thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Pretreatment with aspirin monotherapy increases the bleeding risk of alteplase in both observational and randomised trials with no effect on clinical outcome, and the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage is increased with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. Antiplatelet drugs should not be given in the first 24 h after alteplase treatment. Data from pooled randomised trials and a large observational study show that thrombolysis can probably be done safely in patients given vitamin-K antagonists if the international normalised ratio is less than 1.7, although bleeding risk is slightly raised. Almost no data are available for the safety of alteplase in patients with atrial fibrillation who have been given novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) for stroke prevention.

However, this endeavor has been hindered because of the lack of specific Akt activators. Here, from a cell-based high-throughput chemical genetic screening, we identified a small molecule SC79 that inhibits Akt membrane translocation, but paradoxically activates Akt in the cytosol. SC79 specifically binds to the PH domain of Akt. SC79-bound Akt adopts a conformation favorable for phosphorylation by upstream protein kinases. In a hippocampal neuronal culture system and a mouse model for ischemic stroke, the cytosolic activation of Akt by SC79 is sufficient to recapitulate the primary cellular function of Akt signaling, resulting in augmented neuronal survival. Thus, SC79 is a unique specific Akt activator that may be used to enhance Akt activity in various physiological and pathological conditions.",2012,Journal Article,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,H.

METHODS: Monkeys were either subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) distal to the M1 branch (n = 17) or sham operation (n = 7). Neurological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before and 1 week after operation. RESULTS: After MCAO, six monkeys showed occlusion of the distal M1 segment and infarcts predominantly in the cortical and subcortical regions, without hippocampal and thalamic involvement. They had obvious neurological deficits. The other 11 monkeys showed blockage of the main trunk of the MCA, with infarcts extending into the hippocampus and thalamus, but no substantia nigra involvement. Their infarct volume were larger and neurological deficits were more severe than those after distal M1 occlusion. All sham-operated monkeys displayed normal behavior; however, MRI revealed small infarcts in three animals. CONCLUSIONS: MCAO or even sham operations might cause cerebral infarction in NHPs.

White matter lesions, a common pathology in cerebral small vessel disease, are a major cause of vascular dementia. We investigated whether apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) might be a key molecule in cerebral hypoperfusion, associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown and white matter lesions. APPROACH AND RESULTS: A mouse model of cognitive impairment was developed by inducing chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in white matter including the corpus callosum via bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery. BCAS-induced white matter lesions caused cognitive decline in C57BL/6J (wild-type) mice but not in ASK1-deficient (ASK1(-/-)) mice. Phosphorylated ASK1 increased in wild-type mouse brains, and phosphorylated p38 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression increased in corpus callosum cerebral endothelial cells after BCAS in wild-type mice but not in ASK1(-/-) mice. BCAS decreased claudin-5 expression and disrupted blood-brain barrier in the corpus callosum of wild-type but not ASK1(-/-) mice. Cerebral nitrotyrosine was increased in wild-type and ASK1(-/-) BCAS mice. Cerebral phosphorylated ASK1 did not increase in wild-type mice treated with NADPH-oxidase inhibitor. A p38 inhibitor and NADPH-oxidase inhibitor mimicked the protective effect of ASK1 deficiency against cognitive impairment. Specific ASK1 inhibitor prevented cognitive decline in BCAS mice. In vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation caused the disruption of endothelial tight junctions from wild-type mice but not ASK1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress-ASK1-p38 cascade plays a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, through blood-brain barrier breakdown via the disruption of endothelial tight junctions.

Although most animal models have focused on the impact of arteriole occlusions, clinical evidence indicates that venule occlusions may also be important. We used two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy to quantify changes in blood flow and vessel diameter in capillaries after occlusion of single ascending or surface cortical venules as a function of the connectivity between the measured capillary and the occluded venule. Clotting was induced by injuring the target vessel wall with femtosecond laser pulses. After an ascending venule (AV) occlusion, upstream capillaries showed decreases in blood flow speed, high rates of reversal in flow direction, and increases in vessel diameter. Surface venule occlusions produced similar effects, unless a collateral venule provided a new drain. Finally, we showed that AVs and penetrating arterioles have different nearest-neighbor spacing but capillaries branching from them have similar topology, which together predicted the severity and spatial extent of blood flow reduction after occlusion of either one.

We directly assessed the involvement of TRPM2 channels in ischemic brain injury using pharmacological inhibitors and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TRPM2 expression. Each of the four TRPM2 inhibitors tested provided significant protection to male neurons following in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD), while having no effect in female neurons. Similarly, TRPM2 knockdown by TRPM2 shRNA resulted in significantly reduced neuronal cell death following OGD only in male neurons. The TRPM2 inhibitor clotrimazole reduced infarct volume in male mice, while having no effect on female infarct volume. Finally, intrastriatal injection of lentivirus expressing shRNA against TRPM2 resulted in significantly smaller striatal infarcts only in male mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion, having no significant effect in female mice.

Survivors are often afflicted with long-term neurological sequelae, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, hydrocephalus, and psychiatric disorders. Blood clots disrupting normal cerebrospinal fluid circulation and absorption after germinal matrix hemorrhage are thought to be important contributors towards post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus development. We evaluated if upregulating CD36 scavenger receptor expression in microglia and macrophages through PPARgamma stimulation, which was effective in experimental adult cerebral hemorrhage models and is being evaluated clinically, will enhance hematoma resolution and ameliorate long-term brain sequelae using a neonatal rat germinal matrix hemorrhage model. PPARgamma stimulation (15d-PGJ2) increased short-term PPARgamma and CD36 expression levels as well as enhanced hematoma resolution, which was reversed by a PPARgamma antagonist (GW9662) and CD36 siRNA.

Pericytes, perivascular cells involved in microvascular function, express Notch3. Therefore, we hypothesize that these cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of CADASIL. METHODS: Two-, 7-, and 12-month-old CADASIL mutant mice (TgNotch3(R169C) ) and wild-type controls were examined regarding Notch3 aggregation in pericytes, the coverage of cerebral vessels by pericytes, pericyte numbers, capillary density, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, astrocytic end-feet, and the expression of astrocytic gap junction and endothelial adherens junction protein using immunostaining and Western blot analysis. In addition, we examined cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity using laser Doppler fluxmetry and in vivo microscopy. RESULTS: With increasing age, mutated Notch3 aggregated around pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Notch3 aggregation caused significant reduction of pericyte number and coverage of capillaries by pericyte processes (p < 0.01). These changes were associated with detachment of astrocytic end-feet from cerebral microvessels, leakage of plasma proteins, reduction in expression of endothelial adherens junction protein, and reduced microvascular reactivity to CO2 . Smooth muscle cells were not affected by Notch3 accumulation. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that pericytes are the first cells affected by Notch3 aggregation in CADASIL mice.

There are a number of challenges in translating the growing evidence implicating epigenetics in atherosclerosis to improved therapies for patients. These include the small therapeutic window in conditions such as acute stroke and critical limb ischaemia, since interventions introduced in such patients need to act rapidly and be safe in elderly patients with many co-morbidities.

Cerebral microvessels are formed by endothelial cells (ECs), which are connected through tight junctions, adherens junctions, and stabilizing basement membrane structures. These endothelial connections ensure both vessel stability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions, the latter enabling selective exchange of ions, bioactive molecules, and cells between the bloodstream and brain tissue. Srf(iECKO) mice, permitting conditional EC-specific depletion of the transcription factor Serum Response Factor (SRF), suffer from loss of BBB integrity and intracerebral hemorrhaging. Cerebral microbleeds and larger hemorrhages developed upon postnatal and adult depletion of either SRF or its cofactors Myocardin Related Transcription Factor (MRTF-A/-B), revealing essential requirements of ongoing SRF/MRTF activity for maintenance of cerebral small vessel integrity. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging allowed detection, localization, and time-resolved quantification of BBB permeability and hemorrhage formation in Srf(iECKO) brains. At the molecular level, direct and indirect SRF/MRTF target genes, encoding structural components of tight junctions (Claudins and ZO proteins), adherens junctions (VE-cadherin, alpha-Actinin), and the basement membrane (Collagen IV), were down-regulated upon SRF depletion.

In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes of TLR9 expression and the expression of TLR9 in neurons and glial cells after cerebral ischemia reperfusion in mice. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min in male C57BL/6 mice. The TLR9 expression levels in the tissue surrounding the infarct were detected by Western Blot at 6 h, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d after reperfusion. The expression of TLR9 in neurons and glial cells was observed by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: The expression of TLR9 protein first increased and then decreased, with the peak observed at 14 d-21 d. Only small punctate intracellular TLR9 was occasionally observed in the neurons at each time point, and the TLR9-positive rate showed no difference at different time points. By contrast, the activated microglia gathered at the margin of the infarct, and the intracellular TLR9 changed from scattered small punctate to coarse and lumpy. The TLR9-positive rate of microglia was first increased and then decreased with time, with the peak observed at 3 d. No positive TLR9 staining was found in the astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

Obstructive sleep apnea was modeled by intermittent inflations of a chronically implanted tracheal balloon to occlude the airway during the sleep cycle (termed OSA) in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHRSP) rats, a model of cerebral small vessel disease. SHRSP rats and their parent strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, were exposed to OSA for 2 weeks (from 9 to 11 or from 18 to 20 weeks). At 9 weeks, hypertension was developing in the SHRSP rats and was firmly established by 18 weeks. OSA exposure increased systolic blood pressure in SHRSP rats by approximately 30 mm Hg in both age groups compared with shams that were surgically prepared but not exposed to OSA (P<0.05). OSA exposure also increased systolic blood pressure in WKY rats by 20 and 37 mm Hg at 11 and 20 weeks, respectively (P<0.05). OSA exposure in SHRSP rats compromised blood-brain barrier integrity in white matter at both 11 and 20 weeks of age when compared with SHRSP sham rats (P<0.05). Microglia were activated in SHRSP rats exposed to OSA but not in sham rats at 11 weeks (P<0.05). At 20 weeks, microglia were activated in sham SHRSP rats (P<0.05) compared with WKY sham rats and were not further activated by OSA.

According to our previous study, microRNA-134 (miR-134) could target HSPA12B by binding to its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). However, the regulation of miR-134 on HSPA12B and their role in protecting neuronal cells from ischemic injury are unclear. In this study, the miR-134 expression level was manipulated, and the HSPA12B protein levels were also determined in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated primary cultured neuronal cells in vitro and mouse brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke in vivo. The results showed that miR-134 expression levels increased in primary cultured neuronal cells and mouse brain from 12h to 7 day reoxygenation/reperfusion after 1h OGD or 1h MCAO treatment. miR-134 overexpression promoted neuronal cell death and apoptosis by decreasing HSPA12B protein levels. Conversely, downregulating miR-134 reduced neuronal cell death and apoptosis by enhancing HSPA12B protein levels. Also, HSPA12B siRNA could block miR-134 inhibitor-mediated neuroprotection against OGD-induced neuronal cell injury in vitro. Taken together, miR-134 might influence neuronal cell survival against ischemic injury in primary cultured neuronal cells and mouse brain with ischemic stroke by negatively modulating HSPA12B protein expression in a posttranscriptional manner.",2014,Journal Article,Brain Res,W.

The only treatment today for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborns is hypothermia, which has limited clinical benefit. We have studied changes to the blood-brain barriers (BBB) as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a neonatal model of HIE to further understand the underlying pathologic mechanisms. Nine-day old mice pups, brain roughly equivalent to the near-term human fetus, were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia. Hypoxia-ischemia increased BBB permeability to small and large molecules within hours after the insult, which normalized in the following days. The opening of the BBB was associated with changes to BBB protein expression whereas gene transcript levels were increased showing direct molecular damage to the BBB but also suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Brain pathology was closely related to reductions in rCBF during the hypoxia as well as the areas with compromised BBB showing that these are intimately linked. The transient opening of the BBB after the insult is likely to contribute to the pathology but at the same time provides an opportunity for therapeutics to better reach the infarcted areas in the brain.",2015,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,C.

Although once considered to be a small vessel disease with a favorable outcome, recent studies have reported relatively poor long-term prognoses following small subcortical infarcts. Limited pre-clinical modeling has hampered understanding of the etiology and development of treatments for this disease. Therefore, we attempted to develop a new experimental model of small subcortical infarcts in mice to investigate pathophysiological changes in the corticospinal tract and assess long-term behavioral performance. The vasoconstrictor peptide, endothlin-1 (ET-1), in combination with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), were injected into the internal capsule of mice. Histological and behavioral tests were performed 0-8 weeks after the injection. The ET-1/l-NAME injection resulted in severe neurological deficits that continued for up to 8 weeks. The loss of axons and myelin surrounded by reactive gliosis was identified in the region of the injection, in which the vasoconstriction of microvessels was also observed. Moreover, a tract-tracing study revealed an interruption in axonal flow at the internal capsule. The present model of small subcortical infarcts is unique and novel due to the reproduction of neurological deficits that continue for a long period, up to 8 weeks, as well as the use of mice as experimental animals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined ovine mesenchymal stem cells labeled with VSOP in agarose layer phantoms. The experiments were performed in 2 different groups, with quantities of 0-100,000 labeled cells per layer. 15 different SWI- and T2*-weighted sequences and 3 RF coils were used. All measurements were carried out on a clinical 3T MRI. Images of Group A were analyzed by four radiologists blinded for the number of cells, and rated for detectability according to a four-step scale. Images of Group B were subject to a ROI-based analysis of signal intensities. Signal deviations of more than the 0.95 confidence interval in cell containing layers as compared to the mean of the signal intensity of non cell bearing layers were considered significant. RESULTS: GROUP A: 500 or more labeled cells were judged as confidently visible when examined with a SWI-sequence with 0.15 mm slice thickness. Group B: 500 or more labeled cells showed a significant signal reduction in SWI sequences with a slice thickness of 0.25 mm.

In the present study, we attempted to investigate the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key mitochondrial fission protein, in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Using Drp1 siRNA or Mdivi-1, a small molecule inhibitor of Drp1, we examined the effect of Drp1 knockdown or inhibition on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and death of SH-SY-5Y cells. Cell death and viability were evaluated with LDH and MTT assays, respectively, and mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), and ATP production were assessed using epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and HPLC, respectively. Moreover, to examine the effect of Drp1 inhibition on ischemic brain injury, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice were injected (i.p.) with Mdivi1, and blood-brain barrier permeability, brain water content, and cell apoptosis were assessed. RESULTS: Knockdown or inhibition of Drp1 by Mdivi-1 significantly attenuated OGD-induced cell death in SH-SY-5Y cells, associated with reduced morphological change of mitochondria and attenuated Bax insertion,oligomerization. Moreover, treatment of the MCAO mice with Mdivi-1 remarkably reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner, associated with marked reduction of mitochondrial fragmentation and BAX expression.

Thus, it is important to identify mechanisms by which BBB integrity can be maintained in the face of ischemic injury in experimental stroke. We previously demonstrated that the phylogenetically conserved small heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) protects against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Here we show that HSP27 transgenic overexpression also maintains the integrity of the BBB in mice subjected to tMCAO. Extravasation of endogenous IgG antibodies and exogenous FITC-albumin into the brain following tMCAO was reduced in transgenic mice, as was total brain water content. HSP27 overexpression abolished the appearance of TUNEL-positive profiles in microvessel walls. Transgenics also exhibited less loss of microvessel proteins following tMCAO. Notably, primary endothelial cell cultures were rescued from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) by lentiviral HSP27 overexpression according to four viability assays, supporting a direct effect on this cell type. Finally, HSP27 overexpression reduced the appearance of neutrophils in the brain and inhibited the secretion of five cytokines. These findings reveal a novel role for HSP27 in attenuating ischemia/reperfusion injury - the maintenance of BBB integrity. Endogenous upregulation of HSP27 after ischemia in wild-type animals may exert similar protective functions and warrants further investigation. Exogenous enhancement of HSP27 by rational drug design may lead to future therapies against a host of injuries, including but not limited to a harmful breach in brain vasculature.",2013,Journal Article,CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets,R.

Changes in MRI were related to behavioral performance in executive function tasks and histopathological alterations in the same animals. MRI frequently (70%) showed various degrees of acute ischemic lesions, ranging from very small to large subcortical infarctions. Independently, delayed MRI changes were also apparent. The patterns of MRI alterations were related to either ischemic necrosis or gliosis. Progressive microstructural changes revealed by diffusion tensor imaging in white matter were confirmed by observation of myelinated fiber degeneration, including severe optic tract degeneration. The latter interfered with the visually cued learning paradigms used to test executive functions. Independently of brain damage, BCCAo induced progressive arteriogenesis in the vertebrobasilar tree, a process that was associated with blood flow recovery after 12 weeks. The structural alterations found in the basilar artery were compatible with compensatory adaptive changes driven by shear stress.

Yet these approaches remain confined to a small percentage of stroke patients, often with incomplete reperfusion, and therefore there is an urgent need to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the no-reflow phenomenon that prevents restoration of adequate microvascular perfusion. Recent evidence suggests systemic inflammation as an important contributor to no-reflow and to further investigate this here we inject interleukin 1 (IL-1) i.p. 30 min prior to an ischaemic challenge using a remote filament to occlude the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in mice. Before, during and after the injection of IL-1 and occlusion we use two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy to record the spatial and temporal dynamics of oxyhaemoglobin concentration in the cortical areas supplied by the MCA. Our results reveal that systemic inflammation significantly reduces oxyhaemoglobin reperfusion as early as 3h after filament removal compared to vehicle injected animals. CD41 immunohistochemistry shows a significant increase of hyper-coagulated platelets within the microvessels in the stroked cortex of the IL-1 group compared to vehicle. We also observed an increase of pathophysiological biomarkers of ischaemic damage including elevated microglial activation co-localized with interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), increased blood brain barrier breakdown as shown by IgG infiltration and increased pyknotic morphological changes of cresyl violet stained neurons.

Monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins have revolutionized anti-inflammatory therapies in the last two decades, allowing the specific targeting of single cytokines. They are very effective in extinguishing inflammation from outside the cell, even with the risk of an excessive and prolonged immunosuppression. Small molecules can enter the cell and shutdown the valve of inflammation by directly targeting signal proteins involved in cytokine release or in response to cytokines. They are orally-administrable drugs whose dosage can be easily adjusted to obtain the desired anti-inflammatory effect. This could make these drugs more suitable for a wide range of diseases as stroke, gout, or neurological impairment, where inflammatory activation plays a pivotal role as trigger.

Both placebo-controlled studies tested neuroprotection by Tat-NR2B9c, a prospective therapeutic compound, in anesthetized subjects.

Pericytes show biochemical and physiologic features similar to VSMC, usually containing smooth muscle actin fibers and rich endoplasm reticulum. Studies have indicated that degeneration of VSMCs due to Notch3 mutations is the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). However, it remains unclear whether the Notch3 mutation also affects cerebral cortex capillary pericytes. In this ultrastructural morphologic study, the authors have observed pathological changes in the cerebral cortex capillary pericytes in aged mice that carry human mutant Notch3 genes. The number of abnormal pericytes in the cerebral cortex in Notch3 gene mutant mice was slightly increased when compared to an age-matched control group. Morphologically, the pericytes in the brains of Notch3 gene mutant mice showed more severe cellular injury, such as the presence of damaged mitochondria, secondary lysosomes, and large cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition, morphologic structures related to autophagy were also present in the pericytes of Notch3 gene mutant group. These ultrastructural morphologic alterations suggest that Notch3 mutation precipitates age-related pericytic degeneration that might result in cellular injury and trigger autophagic apoptosis.

Our understanding, however, of the contribution of individual HDAC isoforms to neuronal death is limited. In this study, we used selective chemical probes to assess the individual roles of the Class I HDAC isoforms in protecting Mus musculus primary cortical neurons from oxidative death. We demonstrated that the selective HDAC8 inhibitor PCI-34051 is a potent neuroprotective agent; and by taking advantage of both pharmacological and genetic tools, we established that HDAC8 is not critically involved in PCI-34051's mechanism of action. We used BRD3811, an inactive ortholog of PCI-34051, and showed that, despite its inability to inhibit HDAC8, it exhibits robust neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, molecular deletion of HDAC8 proved insufficient to protect neurons from oxidative death, whereas both PCI-34051 and BRD3811 were able to protect neurons derived from HDAC8 knock-out mice. Finally, we designed and synthesized two new, orthogonal negative control compounds, BRD9715 and BRD8461, which lack the hydroxamic acid motif and showed that they stably penetrate cell membranes but are not neuroprotective. These results indicate that the protective effects of these hydroxamic acid-containing small molecules are likely unrelated to direct epigenetic regulation via HDAC inhibition, but rather due to their ability to bind metals.

The aim of this study was to investigate white matter repair after adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) administration in an experimental model of subcortical stroke. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze the ADMSC secretome and whether this could be implicated in this repair function. METHODS: An animal model of subcortical ischemic stroke with white matter affectation was induced in rats by injection of endothelin-1. At 24 hours, 2 x 10(6) ADMSC were administered intravenously to the treatment group. Functional evaluation, lesion size, fiber tract integrity, cell death, proliferation, white matter repair markers (Olig-2, NF, and MBP) and NogoA were all studied after sacrifice (7 days and 28 days). ADMSC migration and implantation in the brain as well as proteomics analysis and functions of the secretome were also analyzed. RESULTS: Neither ADMSC migration nor implantation to the brain was observed after ADMSC administration. In contrast, ADMSC implantation was detected in peripheral organs. The treatment group showed a smaller functional deficit, smaller lesion area, less cell death, more oligodendrocyte proliferation, more white matter connectivity and higher amounts of myelin formation. The treated animals also showed higher levels of white matter-associated markers in the injured area than the control group. Proteomics analysis of the ADMSC secretome identified 2,416 proteins, not all of them previously described to be involved in brain plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: White matter integrity in subcortical stroke is in part restored by ADMSC treatment; this is mediated by repair molecular factors implicated in axonal sprouting, remyelination and oligodendrogenesis. These findings are associated with improved functional recovery after stroke.",2015,Journal Article,Stem Cell Res Ther,L.

While cell replacement and axonal pathfinding strategies are often explored independently, there is no strategy capable of simultaneously replacing lost neurons and re-establishing long-distance axonal connections in the central nervous system. Accordingly, we have created micro-tissue engineered neural networks (micro-TENNs), which are preformed constructs consisting of long integrated axonal tracts spanning discrete neuronal populations. These living micro-TENNs reconstitute the architecture of long-distance axonal tracts, and thus may serve as an effective substrate for targeted neurosurgical reconstruction of damaged pathways in the brain. Cerebral cortical neurons or dorsal root ganglia neurons were precisely delivered into the tubular constructs, and properties of the hydrogel exterior and extracellular matrix internal column (180-500 mum diameter) were optimized for robust neuronal survival and to promote axonal extensions across the 2.0 cm tube length. The very small diameter permits minimally invasive delivery into the brain. In this study, preformed micro-TENNs were stereotaxically injected into naive rats to bridge deep thalamic structures with the cerebral cortex to assess construct survival and integration. We found that micro-TENN neurons survived at least 1 month and maintained their long axonal architecture along the cortical-thalamic axis. Notably, we also found neurite penetration from micro-TENN neurons into the host cortex, with evidence of synapse formation. These micro-TENNs represent a new strategy to facilitate nervous system repair by recapitulating features of neural pathways to restore or modulate damaged brain circuitry.",2015,Journal Article,Tissue Eng Part A,L.

The administration of EPO after myocardial infarction (MI) reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function in small animals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of EPO in porcine MI. Each animal in the EPO group received four injections of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO; 6000 U per injection) at 2-day intervals, starting after coronary occlusion. Animals in the control group received saline. Left ventriculography was performed just after coronary occlusion and at 28 days. Time-course changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were measured. The number of vessels was calculated, and the mRNA expressions of VEGF and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) were examined. Left ventricular function was similar between the groups. The numbers of cells positive for anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, and c-kit were significantly higher in the EPO group than in the controls (P < 0.05). The EPO group exhibited significantly higher HGF and FGF concentrations (P < 0.05) and higher expression of VEGF and IGF mRNA (P < 0.05) compared with the controls. In conclusion, EPO accelerates angiogenesis via the upregulation of systemic levels such as HGF and FGF, and the local expression of VEGF and IGF, in porcine MI.",2012,Journal Article,Heart Vessels,K.

Recently analysis of human connexin43 (Cx43) DNA sequences has revealed a number of different missense, duplication and frame shift mutations resulting in this phenotype. A mouse model of this disorder has been created with a missense point mutation of the glycine amino acid at position 60 to serine (G60S). Heterozygote +/G60S mice exhibit a similar ODDD phenotype as observed in humans. In addition to the malformations listed above, ODDD patients often have neurological findings. In the brain, Cx43 is highly expressed in astrocytes and has been shown to play a role in neuroprotection. We were interested in determining the effect of the +/G60S mutation following stroke. Four days after middle cerebral artery occlusion the volume of infarct was larger in mice with the +/G60S mutation. In astrocyte-neuron co-cultures, exposure to glutamate also resulted in greater cellular death in the +/G60S mutants. Protein levels of Cx43 in the mutant mouse were found to be reduced when compared to the normal tissue. Cx43 protein was observed as a continual line of small punctate aggregates in the plasma membrane with increased intracellular localization, which is distinct from the larger plaques seen in the normal mouse astrocytes. Functionally, primary +/G60S astrocytes exhibited reduced gap junctional coupling and increased hemichannel activity, which may underlie the mechanism of increased damage during stroke.

Few models of focal white matter stroke exist and this lack of appropriate models has hampered understanding of the neurobiologic mechanisms involved in injury response and repair after this type of stroke. The main limitation of other subcortical stroke models is that they do not focally restrict the infarct to the white matter or have primarily been validated in non-murine species. This limits the ability to apply the wide variety of murine research tools to study the neurobiology of white matter stroke. Here we present a methodology for the reliable production of a focal stroke in murine white matter using a local injection of an irreversible eNOS inhibitor. We also present several variations on the general protocol including two unique stereotactic variations, retrograde neuronal tracing, as well as fresh tissue labeling and dissection that greatly expand the potential applications of this technique.

We detected the expression of Cx43 and phosphorylation of Cx43 (p-Cx43) at 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Meanwhile, we examined the effects of EPO on NVU injuries including neuronal survival, astrocyte activation and regeneration of endothelial cells as well as whether the effects were Cx43 dependent by using multiple inhibitors. We found EPO highly increased p-Cx43, but not total Cx43 at all chosen times. Importantly, EPO led to neurological and blood-brain barrier functions improvement by associating with promotion of angiogenesis as well as reduction of neuronal death, astrocyte activation and neurotoxic substances levels. Moreover, these effects were significantly weakened by the inhibitors blocking GJIC, Cx43 communicative function, phosphorylation and expression, only Cx43 redistribution inhibitor excluded.

Here, we investigated whether NLRP3 knockdown decreases neutrophil infiltration, reduces brain edema, and improves neurological function in an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mouse model. We also determined whether mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) governed by mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) would trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation following ICH. METHODS: ICH was induced by injecting autologous arterial blood (30mul) into a mouse brain. NLRP3 small interfering RNAs were administered 24 hours before ICH. A mPTP inhibitor (TRO-19622) or a specific mitochondria ROS scavenger (Mito-TEMPO) was coinjected with the blood. In naive animals, rotenone, which is a respiration chain complex I inhibitor, was applied to induce mitochondrial ROS production, and followed by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO treatment. Neurological deficits, brain edema, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, in vivo chemical cross-linking, ROS assay, and immunofluorescence were evaluated. RESULTS: ICH activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 knockdown reduced brain edema and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels at 24 hours, and improved neurological functions from 24 to 72 hours following ICH. TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO reduced ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and MPO levels following ICH. In naive animals, rotenone administration induced mPTP formation, ROS generation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which were then reduced by TRO-19622 or Mito-TEMPO. INTERPRETATION: The NLRP3 inflammasome amplified the inflammatory response by releasing IL-1beta and promoting neutrophil infiltration following ICH. Mitochondria ROS may be a major trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The results of our study suggest that the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome may effectively reduce the inflammatory response following ICH.ANN NEUROL 2014;75:209-219.",2014,Journal Article,Ann Neurol,Q.

The present study aims to identify new transcription factors (TFs) following focal cerebral ischaemia in rat as potential therapeutic targets. A transient focal cerebral ischaemia model was used for TF-binding activity and TF-TF interaction profile analysis. A permanent focal cerebral ischaemia model was used for the transcript gene analysis and for the protein study. The identification of TF variants, mRNA analysis, and protein study was performed using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), qPCR, and Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. Rat cortical neurons were transfected with small interfering RNA against the TF in order to study its role. The TF-binding analysis revealed a differential binding activity of the octamer family in ischaemic brain in comparison with the control brain samples both in acute and late phases. In this study, we focused on Oct-2 TF. Five of the six putative Oct-2 transcript variants are expressed in both control and ischaemic rat brain, showing a significant increase in the late phase of ischaemia. Oct-2 protein showed neuronal localisation both in control and ischaemic rat brain cortical slices. Functional studies revealed that Oct-2 interacts with TFs involved in important brain processes (neuronal and vascular development) and basic cellular functions and that Oct-2 knockdown promotes neuronal injury. The present study shows that Oct-2 expression and binding activity increase in the late phase of cerebral ischaemia and finds Oct-2 to be involved in reducing ischaemic-mediated neuronal injury.",2014,Journal Article,Neuromolecular Med,S.

Here we investigated the formation of microgliosis and infiltration of circulating cells in a photothrombosis stroke model by taking advantage of parabiosis and two-photon microscopy. We found that a small population of blood-derived CX3CR1(GFP/+) cells infiltrated the cerebral parenchyma, but these cells did not proliferate and were phenotypically distinguishable from resident microglia. CX3CR1(GFP/+) infiltrating cells also displayed different kinetics from reactive microglia. The number of CX3CR1(GFP/+) infiltrating cells peaked on Day 5 after stroke and then decreased. The decline of these infiltrating cells was associated with an active apoptotic process. In contrast, reactive microglia were recruited to the ischaemic area continuously during the first week after stroke induction. Immunohistology and in vivo two-photon imaging revealed that cells involved in the process of microgliosis were mainly derived from proliferating resident microglia. Expansion of microglia exhibited a consistent pattern and our in vivo data demonstrated for the first time that microglia underwent active division in regions surrounding the ischaemic core. Together, these results indicated that CX3CR1(GFP/+) infiltrating cells and reactive microglia represented two distinct populations of cells with different functions and therapeutic potentials for the treatment of stroke.",2013,Journal Article,Brain,T.

Excitatory glutamate transporter subtype 2 (GLT-1) carries bulk of glutamate reuptake in cerebral ischemia. Although GLT-1 expression fluctuates during the period of ischemia, little is known about its regulatory mechanism. Here we show an up-regulation of GLT-1 via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-Akt-nuclear factor-small ka, CyrillicB (NF-small ka, CyrillicB) signaling cascade in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that brief rapamycin treatment significantly increased GLT-1 expression in cultured astrocytes. Rapamycin increased phosphorylation of raptor at Ser792 and decreased phosphorylation of rictor at Thr1135, suggesting that both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are involved in GLT-1 expression. This conclusion was further confirmed by raptor and rictor disruption experiments. Akt was activated by mTORC1 inhibition and required for GLT-1 expression because triciribine, a specific inhibitor of Akt, blocked the increase of GLT-1 expression. mTOR-Akt cascade then activated NF-small ka, CyrillicB and increased small ka, CyrillicB-motif-binding phosphoprotein (KBBP) expression and GLT-1 transcription. We next demonstrated that mTOR-Akt-NF-small ka, CyrillicB cascade was activated in OGD and subsequently caused the upregulation of GLT-1. Supporting evidence included: (1) inhibition of Akt or NF-small ka, CyrillicB occluded OGD-induced GLT-1 upregulation; (2) Raptor knock-down plus OGD did not add to the increase of GLT-1 expression; (3) Intact mTORC2 was required for GLT-1 enhancement.

CNTF increases rapidly and greatly following traumatic or ischemic injury. Understanding the underlying mechanisms would help to design pharmacological treatments to increase endogenous CNTF levels for neuroprotection. Here, we show that astroglial CNTF expression in the adult mouse striatum is increased twofold within 1 h and increases up to >30-fold over 2 weeks following a focal stroke caused by a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Selective neuronal loss caused by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid resulted in a comparable increase. Cocultured neurons reduced CNTF expression in astrocytes, which was prevented by light trypsinization. RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) blocking peptides induced CNTF expression, which was dependent on transcription. Astroglial CNTF expression was not affected by diffusible neuronal molecules or by neurotransmitters. The transient ischemia does not seem to directly increase CNTF, as intrastriatal injection of an ischemic solution or exposure of naive mice or cultured cells to severe hypoxia had minimal effects. Inflammatory mechanisms were probably also not involved, as intrastriatal injection of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNgamma, IL6) in naive mice had no or small effects, and anti-inflammatory treatments did not diminish the increase in CNTF after MCAO. CNTF-/- mice had more extensive tissue loss and similar astrocyte activation after MCAO than their wild-type littermates.

Similar quantification of motor function deficits has been measured in rodent animal models of such injuries. However, due to differences in fundamental structure of human and rodent brains, there is a need to develop a large animal model to facilitate treatment development for neurological conditions. Porcine brain structure is similar to that of humans, and therefore the pig may make a more clinically relevant animal model. The current study was undertaken to determine key gait characteristics in normal biomedical miniature pigs and dynamic changes that occur post-neural injury in a porcine middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke model. Yucatan miniature pigs were trained to walk through a semi-circular track and were recorded with high speed cameras to detect changes in key gait parameters. Analysis of normal pigs showed overall symmetry in hindlimb swing and stance times, forelimb stance time, along with step length, step velocity, and maximum hoof height on both fore and hindlimbs. A subset of pigs were again recorded at 7, 5 and 3 days prior to MCA occlusion and then at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days following surgery. MRI analysis showed that MCA occlusion resulted in significant infarction. Gait analysis indicated that stroke resulted in notable asymmetries in both temporal and spatial variables. Pigs exhibited lower maximum front hoof height on the paretic side, as well as shorter swing time and longer stance time on the paretic hindlimb. These results support that gait analysis of stroke injury is a highly sensitive detection method for changes in gait parameters in pig.",2014,Journal Article,Physiol Behav,K. J.

METHODS: Rats were subjected to photothrombotic infarct. The large stroke (LS) and small stroke (SS) groups were subdivided and task-specific training (TST) was initiated at 1, 5, or 14 days poststroke. Behavioral tests were performed at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days poststroke. The differences of axonal sprouting in the cortex, red nucleus, cerebral peduncle, and pyramid level were compared by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SS groups with TST starting at 1 day and 5 days showed significantly better recovery in the behavioral tests. LS group with TST starting at 5 days showed better recovery, while those with TST starting at 1 day showed worse recovery. Contralesional axonal sprouting was increased in both groups with TST starting at 5 days. However, it was decreased in the LS group with TST starting at 1 day. Transcallosal axonal sprouting from the contralesional motor cortex was increased in the LS group with TST starting at 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Functional recovery after stroke may vary, depending on the lesion size and the timing of rehabilitation. The underlying mechanism may involve contralesional CST plasticity and transcallosal axonal sprouting.",2013,Journal Article,Restor Neurol Neurosci,K. H.

Using Thy1-GFP transgenic mice, we visualized the impact of microocclusions on neuronal structure. Microocclusions in the hippocampus produce cell loss or neuronal atrophy (~7% of lodged microspheres led to microinfarcts), while axons within white matter tracts, as well as the striatum and thalamus became blebbed or disrupted. Although the neocortex contained more occlusions than other structures, labeled layer 5 neurons were relatively resistant to structural damage, with <2% of the lodged microspheres producing obvious neuronal damage.",2015,Journal Article,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,G.

Here, we have investigated whether reprogramming NSCs with minocycline, a broadly used antibiotic also known to possess cytoprotective properties, enhances survival of grafted cells and promotes neuroprotection in ischemic stroke. NSCs harvested from the subventricular zone of fetal rats were preconditioned with minocycline in vitro and transplanted into rat brains 6 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Histological and behavioral tests were examined from days 0-28 after stroke. For in vitro experiments, NSCs were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation. Cell viability and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed. Minocycline preconditioning protected the grafted NSCs from ischemic reperfusion injury via upregulation of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. Additionally, preconditioning with minocycline induced the NSCs to release paracrine factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, transplantation of the minocycline-preconditioned NSCs significantly attenuated infarct size and improved neurological performance, compared with non-preconditioned NSCs. Minocycline-induced neuroprotection was abolished by transfecting the NSCs with Nrf2-small interfering RNA before transplantation. Thus, preconditioning with minocycline, which reprograms NSCs to tolerate oxidative stress after ischemic reperfusion injury and express higher levels of paracrine factors through Nrf2 up-regulation, is a simple and safe approach to enhance the effectiveness of transplantation therapy in ischemic stroke.",2012,Journal Article,J Neurosci,H.
