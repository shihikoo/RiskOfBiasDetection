Abstract—Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to promote
post-stroke angiogenesis and long-term functional recovery; however, whether IL-6 could promote post-stroke neurogenesis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate
the eﬀects of IL-6 on neurogenesis after ischemic stroke.
We also investigated whether pair housing (PH) could
improve the experimental stroke outcome through IL-6.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was
induced in mice treated with recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) or
anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-6 mAbs). Another
set of mice were pair-housed (PH; male and ovariectomized
female) for 2 weeks, subjected to tMCAO and then assigned
to a housing condition (isolated or PH). Pair-housed mice
were treated with anti-IL-6 mAbs. Behavioral assessments
were made 3 days before tMCAO and after 28 days of reperfusion. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) at 14 days post-ischemia
were treated with rIL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R).
The eﬀects of IL-6 on the proliferation and diﬀerentiation
of NPCs were examined in vivo and in vitro. The role and
mechanism of IL-6 in PH-mediated enhancement of NPC
proliferation and functional recovery were investigated
in vivo. We found that anti-IL-6 mAbs signiﬁcantly reduced
the proliferation and neuronal diﬀerentiation of NPCs in
the ipsilateral SVZ, as well as functional recovery; whereas

occlusion, neural progenitor cells, pair housing.

INTRODUCTION
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as ciliary neurotrophic factor
(CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), belong to
the family of glycoprotein 130 (gp130)-activating
cytokines. IL-6 acts on target cells through a membrane
glycoprotein, gp130, which associates with IL-6 receptor
(Heinrich et al., 2003). Alternatively, IL-6 can also signal
through a soluble IL-6 receptor. Depending on the cellular
context, IL-6 may exert an array of diverse and competing
eﬀects including anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative and
diﬀerentiation-inducing eﬀects. It has been shown that
IL-6 could promote neuronal diﬀerentiation of neural
stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) dissociated from normal
adult mice (Barkho et al., 2006). Under physiological conditions, adult IL-6 knockout mice exhibit signiﬁcantly lower
neural progenitor cell (NPC) survival and proliferation in
the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ)
(Bowen et al., 2011). A recent study showed that IL-6 produced locally by resident brain cells promotes angiogenesis in the delayed phases of stroke recovery (Gertz et al.,
2012). However, it is unclear whether IL-6 could aﬀect
post-stroke neurogenesis, which has been shown to be
coupled with angiogenesis in brain tissue repair and
remodeling after stroke (Kojima et al., 2010).
Research suggests that stroke survivors often
experience social isolation. Social interaction could
improve quality of life and decreases mortality after
stroke (Boden-Albala et al., 2005; Hinojosa et al., 2011).
In order to discover the biological mechanisms underlying
the beneﬁts of social interaction, development of preclinical animal studies are required. Pair housing (PH) of
mice could well reproduce social interaction in animal
studies, and social companionship provided by PH
encourages social interaction (Craft et al., 2005; Venna
et al., 2014). In recent years, increasing evidences have

shown that PH could decrease infarct size and brain atrophy, and increase neurogenesis and long-term functional
recovery after ischemic stroke (Craft et al., 2005; Karelina
et al., 2009; O’Keefe et al., 2014; Venna et al., 2014;
Verma et al., 2014). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. A previous study showed
that PH increases central levels of IL-6 in the acute phase
of stroke, and treatment with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody increases infarct volume and eliminates the eﬀect
of PH on infarct size (Karelina et al., 2009). However, it
is still unclear whether PH could increase central expression of IL-6 and improve long-term functional recovery
through IL-6 in the later phases of stroke recovery.
Here we initially investigated the eﬀects of IL-6 on the
post-stroke neurogenesis using experimental stroke
models and primary NPC cultures obtained from the
ipsilateral SVZ at 14 days post-ischemia. Our results
indicated that IL-6 played important roles in the
maintenance and augment of ischemia-induced
proliferation and neuronal diﬀerentiation of SVZ NPCs,
as well as long-term functional recovery. In addition, we
went on to investigate the role of IL-6 in PH-mediated
eﬀects on the proliferation of NPCs and long-term
functional recovery. We found that PH increased the
expression of IL-6 in the ipsilateral hemisphere through
inhibition of calpain activity during stroke recovery. PH
improved the proliferation of SVZ NPCs and long-term
functional recovery; anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies
abrogated the eﬀects. Our results suggest that IL-6 is
essential for the promoting eﬀects of social interaction
on the neurogenesis and long-term outcome after
ischemic stroke.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old, 23–25 g) were
purchased from Wuhan University Laboratory Animal
Center. All experimental protocols and animal handling
procedures were performed in accordance with the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23)
revised 1996 and the experimental protocols were
approved by the committee of experimental animals of
Tongji Medical College.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of
focal ischemia
The animals were maintained at constant room
temperature (23.0 ± 1.0 °C), humidity 55–65% and 12-h
light–dark cycle. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of
the right middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) with a 6–0
silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament, as previously
described (Hata et al., 1998). Brieﬂy, under the operating
microscope, the right common carotid artery (CCA), the
right external carotid artery (ECA), and the right internal
carotid artery (ICA) were isolated and a 6–0 suture was

161

tied at the origin of the ECA and at the distal end of the
ECA. The right CCA and ICA were temporarily occluded.
The silicon-coated nylon suture was introduced into the
ECA and pushed up the ICA until resistance was felt
and the ﬁlament was inserted about 9 to 10 mm from
the carotid bifurcation, eﬀectively blocking the middle
cerebral artery (MCA). The diameter of the tip of coated
suture was considered acceptable between 180 and
220 lm. The suture remained inserted for 60 min, after
which it was removed and the ECA was permanently tied.
In the sham controls, the arteries were visualized but not
disturbed. Occlusion was conﬁrmed by laser-Doppler
ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system 5000, PERIMED, Stockholm,
Sweden) with a probe placed on thinned skull over the lateral parietal cortex (Zhang et al., 2014). Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with a feed-back
temperature control unit until the mice had recovered from
surgery. Subcutaneous normal saline (0.9%) was administered daily, adjusting the volume according to the animal’s weight loss. After mice had recovered from
surgery, an 18-point scoring system was used to evaluate
the sensorimotor deﬁcits (Zhang et al., 2014). The number of animals used for each experimental group is provided in the ﬁgure legends and summarized in Table 1.
In experiment 1, C57BL/6 mice were subject to sham
or 60-min ischemia followed by 1, 3, 6, 14, 21, 28, and
42 days of reperfusion to measure the expression
patterns of IL-6 (Fig. 1A).
In experiment 2, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided
into ﬁve groups: (1) Cerebral I/R group (MCAO) (60 min
ischemia followed by 28 days reperfusion); (2–3) IL-6
neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-6 mAbs) treatment group:
Intracerebroventricular cannulation was performed
according to previously established protocols (Karelina
et al., 2009). Mice received intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
either anti-IL-6 mAbs (10 ng in 2 ll aCSF) (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) or 2-ll aCSF. This dose has been
used successfully to neutralize IL-6 signaling in mice
(Meagher et al., 2007); (4–5) recombinant mouse-IL-6
(rIL-6) treatment group: A sterile 26-G Hamilton microsyringe (80330; Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) was
used to intranasally administer 2-ll drops of rIL-6 (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) diluted in PBS (0.01 lg/ll)
or its vehicle (PBS) to alternating nostrils with a 2-min
interval between applications. Drops were placed at the
opening of the nostril, allowing the mice to snort each drop
into the nasal cavity. A total of 10 ll of dose solution, containing 0.1 lg rIL-6 was delivered over a course of 5 min.
The injection of anti-IL-6 mAbs (or aCSF) or rIL-6 (or vehicle) was repeated every 24 h for 2 week starting at 14dpi
(Fig. 1B).
Experiment 3 was designed to test the role of IL-6 in
mediating the eﬀects of social interaction on stroke
outcome. C57BL/6 mice were housed either individually
(socially isolated) or with an ovariectomized female (PH)
for a period of 2 weeks before surgery and throughout
the reperfusion period. Anti-IL-6 mAbs (10 ng in 2 ll
aCSF) or 2-ll aCSF was administrated i.c.v. to pairhoused mice for 2 weeks starting at 14dpi. Calpain

5-Bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling
Mice were treated twice with BrdU (dissolved at 10 mg/ml
in saline, 50 mg/kg per injection; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) with an 8-h interval between injections at 27dpi;
on the following day, the animals were humanely killed
to analyze BrdU labeling of dividing cells.
Functional assays
All the behavioral studies were performed in a doubleblind, randomized manner. The elevated body swing
test (EBST) was used to test asymmetrical motor
behavior. The rotarod test and pole test were used to
assess locomotor balance and coordination. EBST and

rotarod test were performed as described at 28dpi (Sun
et al., 2012). The pole test was performed as described
previously at 28dpi (Gertz et al., 2012).

Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) measurements of mRNA
RT-PCR was used to assess abundances of IL-6 mRNA
in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Total RNA was isolated
using TrizolTM Regent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with Taqman
reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). IL-6 and b-actin cDNA were ampliﬁed using
Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Two-step real-time PCR was performed (95 °C for
15 s, 60 °C for 60 s extension and detection, 40 cycles)
with speciﬁc primers for IL-6 (forward: 50 - GAGGATAC

value is expressed as 2DCt, where DCt is the diﬀerence
between

Western blotting
Total protein extraction from the ipsilateral hemisphere
was performed according to a commercially available kit
(KGP250; Nanjing Keygen Biotech Co. Ltd., Nanjing,
China). Equal amounts of total protein extracts were
separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore) by
electrophoresis, and membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 1 h at
room temperature. Membranes were then incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against IL-6
(1:500; Abclonal, Shanghai, China), aII-spectrin (1:500;
Abclonal, Shanghai, China), b-actin (1:2000; Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) followed by horse radish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000;
Proteintech Group, Inc., Wuhan, Hubei, China). Labeled
proteins were detected with the ChemiDocXRS
+ chemiluminescence
imaging
system
(Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Protein bands were quantiﬁed by
Image LabTM image acquisition and analysis software.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains were embedded with paraﬃn.
Brains were cut into 4-lm-thick coronal sections. Cell
cultures were ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 min. For both sections and cells, nonspeciﬁc binding
was blocked using normal goat serum. Immunoassays
were performed using the following antibodies at
concentrations (and using protocols) recommended by
the respective manufacturers: BrdU (1:500; Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), doublecortin
(DCX; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), Tuj-1 (1:500;
Cell Signaling Technology) and GFAP (1:500; Cell
Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies were detected
with cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Abbkine, CA,
USA), dylight 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (1:200; Abbkine). Images were acquired from
ﬁve random slides each brain, with each slide containing
eight ﬁelds view.
Neurosphere cultures
Ipsilateral SVZ cells were dissociated from ipsilateral
brains at 14dpi. After digestion, the cells were cultured in
cell proliferation medium (DMEM/F-12 medium (Thermo
Scientiﬁc HyClone, Beijing, China) supplemented with
1% penicillin plus streptomycin (Solarbio Science &
Technology, Beijing, China), 2 lg/ml heparin (StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 1% insulintransferrin-selenium (ITS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA),
2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen/Gibco, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF;
PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and 20 ng/ml basic

ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF; PeproTech) at a
concentration of 5  104 cells/ml. Cells were maintained
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in an incubator with high humidity.
The medium was changed twice per week. After 7–
10 days of culture, primary neurospheres of 100–150 lm
in diameter could be collected without disturbing the
attached cells and were passaged into fresh cell
proliferation medium. Passage 2 SVZ neurospheres
were dissociated to single cells and placed onto a poly-Lornithine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)- and laminin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)-coated coverslip in cell
proliferation medium. At 18 h post-plating, medium was
changed into diﬀerentiation medium (DMEM/F-12
medium supplemented with 1% penicillin plus
streptomycin, 1% ITS, 2% B27 supplement, 1% FBS
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA)) and diﬀerentiated for 7 days.
Assessment of neurosphere formation and
proliferation
Passage 2 neurospheres were dissociated to single cells
and were passaged into 24-well plates and cultured in
fresh cell proliferation medium. 2 h after the passage,
the proliferation medium was supplemented with rIL-6
(20 ng/ml) plus soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R, 100 ng/ml)
every 24 h for 7 days. The neurosphere number was
counted on day 8.
Assessment of neural precursor cell (NPC)
diﬀerentiation
At 2 h after diﬀerentiation induction, the diﬀerentiation
medium of passage 2 neurospheres was supplemented
with rIL-6 (20 ng/ml) plus sIL-6R (100 ng/ml) every 24 h
for 7 days. Diﬀerentiated cells were collected by ﬁxation
using 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical
staining using cell lineage-speciﬁc antibodies.
Statistical analyses
Multiple comparisons were performed by a one-way
ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison
tests
(GraphPad
PrismVersion
5.0,
GraphPad
Software). Two groups were compared by two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Behavioral data were analyzed by a
two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by
post hoc multiple comparison tests. All data are
presented as mean ± SEM, P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
IL-6 increases after cerebral I/R injury
First, we sought to establish the temporal expression
proﬁle of IL-6 in the ipsilateral hemisphere after transient
focal ischemia. We found that IL-6 messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression
increased signiﬁcantly at 1 (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05,
respectively), 3 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively)
and 28 days post-ischemia (dpi) (P < 0.05 and
P < 0.01, respectively) compared with the sham group
(Fig. 2A, B, n = 5/group).

Fig. 2. The increased levels of IL-6 during stroke recovery promoted the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the production of
neuroblasts in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Ischemia was induced by MCAO for 1 h. Levels of IL-6 were measured by real-time PCR (A) and
western blotting (B) in the ipsilateral hemisphere after 60 min of ischemia and reperfusion for diﬀerent times (n = 5/group). IL-6 messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression signiﬁcantly increased at 1, 3 and 28 days post-ischemia (dpi). (C) Immunoﬂuorescence imaging for

IL-6 blocking inhibits, whereas rIL-6 enhances the
proliferation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) and the
production of neuroblasts
We assessed cell proliferation by treating 27dpi mice
twice with S-phase marker BrdU with an 8-h interval
between injections; on the following day, the animals
were humanely killed to analyze BrdU labeling of
dividing cells in the ipsilateral SVZ. Results showed that
anti-IL-6 mAbs treatment group had signiﬁcantly fewer

BrdU-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ at 28dpi
compared with the aCSF treatment group (P < 0.05),
whereas rIL-6 treatment conferred the opposite eﬀects
(P < 0.05). The number of BrdU/DCX double-positive
migrating neuroblast cells in the ipsilateral SVZ at 28dpi
of anti-IL-6 mAbs treatment group was signiﬁcantly
decreased compared with the aCSF treatment group
(P < 0.05), whereas rIL-6 treatment also had the
opposite eﬀects (Fig. 2C, D, P < 0.05, n = 5/group).

this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

IL-6 promotes the neuronal diﬀerentiation of NPCs in
culture
To further investigate the direct function of IL-6 in the
neuronal diﬀerentiation of NPCs, we prepared
neurosphere cultures from the SVZ of ischemic mice at
14dpi. We ﬁrst investigate the eﬀects of IL-6 on
neurosphere formation in vitro, the neurosphere number
was measured 24 h after the treatment of rIL-6 plus sIL6R. The neurosphere formation was signiﬁcantly
promoted by the treatment with rIL-6 plus sIL-6R
(Fig. 3A, B, P < 0.05, n = 3). We next analyzed the
role of IL-6 activation in NPC diﬀerentiation,
immunoﬂuorescent staining with antibodies against
b3-tubulin and GFAP was performed on NPCs after
7 days of diﬀerentiation. As expected, treatment with
rIL-6 plus sIL-6R signiﬁcantly increased the percentage
of b3-tubulin-positive neurons and reduced the percentage
of GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 3C, D, P < 0.05, n = 3).
IL-6 blocking worsens, whereas rIL-6 improves
functional outcome after stroke
We found that deﬁcits in the EBST (Fig. 4A, P < 0.05,
n = 12/group), the rotarod test (Fig. 4B, P < 0.05,
n = 12/group) and the pole test (Fig. 4C, D, P < 0.01
and P < 0.05, respectively, n = 12/group) were worse
in the anti-IL-6 mAbs-treated mice tested at 28dpi,

compared to aCSF-treated mice. However, the deﬁcits
in the rotarod test (Fig. 4B, P < 0.05, n = 12/group)
and the pole test (Fig. 4C, D, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05,
respectively, n = 12/group) were better in the rIL-6treated WT mice, compared to vehicle-treated WT mice,
suggesting that IL-6 improves functional outcome
associated with physical activity after focal ischemia.

PH promotes the proliferation of SVZ NPCs and
functional recovery through IL-6
To examine whether post-stroke housing manipulation
inﬂuences stroke outcome, all mice were initially pair
housed for two weeks prior to a 60-min MCAO and
assigned to one of the two housing conditions: (1)
Housed in a cage individually (ISO), (2) paired with
ovariectomized female not subjected to stroke surgery
(PH). Results showed that pair-housed mice had
signiﬁcantly more BrdU+ (P < 0.05) and BrdU+/DCX+
cells (Fig. 5A, B, P < 0.05, n = 5/group) at 28dpi
compared with ISO cohorts in the ipsilateral SVZ.
Functional outcome analysis showed that deﬁcits in the
EBST (Fig. 6A, P < 0.05, n = 12/group), the rotarod
test (Fig. 6B, P < 0.05, n = 12/group) and the pole test
(Fig. 6C, D, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively,

swing test (EBST) (A), rotarod test (B), and pole test (time to turn completely head down (C) and time to reach the ﬂoor (D)). Anti-IL-6 mAbs
treatment signiﬁcantly worsened the deﬁcits in the EBST, rotarod test and pole test; whereas rIL-6 treatment signiﬁcantly improved the deﬁcits in the
rotarod test and pole test at 28dpi. anti-IL-6: anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies; rIL-6: recombinant mouse IL-6. Data represent mean ± SEM
(n = 12/group). #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01.

Next, we investigated the function of IL-6 in PHmediated enhancement of NPC proliferation and
functional recovery. We observed that anti-IL-6 mAbs
signiﬁcantly abrogated the promoting eﬀects of PH on
the number of BrdU+ (P < 0.05) and BrdU+/DCX+
cells (Fig. 5A, B, P < 0.05, n = 5/group) in the
ipsilateral SVZ at 28dpi. The deﬁcits in the EBST
(Fig. 6A, P < 0.05, n = 12/group), the rotarod test (Fig. 6B,
P < 0.05, n = 12/group) and the pole test (Fig. 6C, D,
P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively, n = 12/group)
were worse in anti-IL-6 mAbs-treated pair-housed mice
tested at 28dpi, compared to aCSF-treated pair-housed
mice.
PH increases the expression levels of IL-6 through
the inhibition of calpain activity after stroke
Having established that PH promoted NPC proliferation
and functional recovery during stroke recovery, we next

sought to explore the underlying mechanisms. The
protein expression of calpain-speciﬁc aII-spectrin
breakdown products of 145 kDa (SBDP145) (Nath et al.,
1996; Wang, 2000) or IL-6 in the ipsilateral hemisphere
was signiﬁcantly increased at 28dpi in both pair-housed
mice (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) and ISO mice
(Fig. 7A, B, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively, n = 5/
group) compared with corresponding sham-operated
mice. Compared to ISO mice, pair-housed mice had signiﬁcantly decreased expression of SBDP145 at 28dpi
(Fig. 7A, P < 0.05, n = 5/group). However, PH markedly
increased IL-6 levels at 28dpi compared with ISO cohorts
(Fig. 7B, P < 0.05, n = 5/group). Calpain inhibitor calpeptin treatment showed a signiﬁcant increase in
IL-6 expression at 28dpi in pair-housed mice (Fig. 7C,
P < 0.05, n = 5/group). Taken together, our results
suggest that PH increases the IL-6 levels through the
inhibition of calpain activity in our stroke recovery
model.

DISCUSSION
Stroke is the second most common cause of death and
major cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide
(Donnan et al., 2008; Go et al., 2014) due to its limited
spontaneous recovery (Thored et al., 2006). Stroke survivors are at a risk of social isolation, often because of
their limited functional mobility. Evidences have shown
that social interaction is one of the most recognized psychological factors inﬂuencing mortality and recovery from
disease including stroke (Morris et al., 1990; Hinojosa
et al., 2011; Steptoe et al., 2013). Mice pair housed prior
to ischemic stroke have a 100% survival rate after 7 days
in contrast to a 40% survival rate among isolated mice
(Karelina et al., 2009). Through analyzing the long-term
eﬀects of social interaction on stroke outcome, Verma
et al. found that PH could signiﬁcantly reduce cerebral
atrophy and improve functional recovery 6 weeks after
onset of stroke (Verma et al., 2014). The beneﬁcial eﬀects
of social interaction on infarct volume and behavioral
recovery were evident in both sexes (Venna et al.,
2012). Our present study conﬁrmed the beneﬁcial eﬀects
of social interaction on neurogenesis and long-term functional recovery after ischemic stroke (Venna et al., 2014).
We found that PH signiﬁcantly increased the proliferation
of NPCs and the production of neuroblasts, as well as the
functional recovery in the later phases of stroke recovery.
However, the mechanisms underlying the promoting
eﬀects of PH on stroke outcome is poorly understood. In
the present study, we showed for the ﬁrst time that social
interaction improved functional recovery through the

elevation of the expression of IL-6, as demonstrated by
the inhibition of NPC proliferation and functional recovery
in the ipsilateral SVZ after the treatment with anti-IL-6
mAbs in pair-housed mice.
IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, is the archetypal member
of the gp130-related cytokine family, which also includes
CNTF, LIF, IL-11, IL-27, OSM, CT-1, and CLC. The IL-6
receptor consists of two polypeptide chains which exist
in transmembrane and soluble forms (Kishimoto, 2006).
IL-6 induces intracellular signaling pathways after binding
to its membrane bound receptor (IL-6R) and subsequent
association with the membrane bound gp130, through
which IL-6 principally exerts its homeostatic functions.
IL-6 can also bind to soluble forms of the IL-6R (sIL-6R)
and in principle activate all cells due to the uniform
expression of gp130 (Wolf et al., 2014). It is worth noting
that all cells in the body express gp130, whereas only few
cells express IL-6R. In NPCs, IL-6 induces intracellular
signaling pathways through binding to sIL-6R and then
activating gp130 due to the absence of IL-6R in the membrane (Islam et al., 2009). Previous study has shown that
IL-6 could promote neuronal diﬀerentiation of NPCs
obtained from normal adult mice (Barkho et al., 2006).
Under physiological conditions, adult IL-6 knockout significantly decreases NPC survival and proliferation in the DG
and SVZ (Bowen et al., 2011). Gertz et al. shows that IL-6
produced locally by resident brain cells promotes angiogenesis and functional recovery (Gertz et al., 2012). Neurogenesis is shown to be coupled with angiogenesis in
brain tissue repair and remodeling after stroke (Kojima
et al., 2010). Our results further validated this view in

Fig. 6. Pair housing promoted functional recovery through IL-6 at 28 days post-ischemia (dpi). Behavioral tests were assessed at 28dpi, including
the elevated body swing test (EBST) (A), rotarod test (B), and pole test (time to turn completely head down (C) and time to reach the ﬂoor (D)). Pair
housing signiﬁcantly improved the deﬁcits in the EBST, rotarod test and pole test, whereas anti-IL-6 mAbs treatment eliminated the eﬀect of pair
housing on the deﬁcits in the EBST, rotarod test and pole test. ISO: isolated cohorts; PH: pair housing; anti-IL-6: anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies.

the present study. We showed for the ﬁrst time that inhibiting IL-6 with anti-IL-6 mAbs signiﬁcantly decreased
ischemia-induced proliferation of NPCs and the production of neuroblasts in the ipsilateral SVZ at 28dpi, whereas
rIL-6 had the opposite eﬀects, indicating that IL-6 plays
key roles in the maintenance and augment of neurogenesis in the later phases of stroke recovery.
Calpains are ubiquitous proteases involved in cell
proliferation, adhesion and motility. A recent study
showed that calpains play important roles in the
negative regulation of post-stroke neurogenesis, genetic
deletion of the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin
impairs both NPC proliferation and neuroblast migration,
whereas treatment with calpain inhibitor calpeptin
increases NPC proliferation, migration speed and
migration distance in cells from the ipsilateral SVZ

(Machado et al., 2015). In this study, PH signiﬁcantly
decreased the activity of calpains during stroke recovery.
A previous study showed that PH increases central levels
of IL-6 in the acute phase of stroke, and treatment with the
anti-IL-6 mAbs increases infarct volume and eliminates
the eﬀect of PH on infarct size (Karelina et al., 2009).
Our data further demonstrated that, in addition to the promoting eﬀects on IL-6 levels in the acute phase, PH could
also increased the expression of IL-6 in the ispilateral
hemisphere and improved neurogenesis and functional
recovery via IL-6 in the later phases of stroke recovery.
Furthermore, our results showed that inhibition of calpains
with calpeptin signiﬁcantly increased IL-6 levels in the
ispilateral hemisphere in pair-housed mice, suggesting
that PH promotes neurogenesis and functional recovery
through inhibition of calpain activity and subsequent

SDS–PAGE gel (6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel). b-actin was used as an internal reference. A 145-kDa band corresponding to SBDP145

elevation of the expression of IL-6 in the ispilateral hemisphere in the later phases of stroke recovery.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results provide a better insight into the mechanism by
which PH improves stroke outcome. In this mechanism,
PH may promote neurogenesis and functional recovery
through the reduction of calpain-mediated inhibition of
IL-6 levels in the later phases of stroke recovery.
Calpain-IL-6 pathway is a key point in controlling
PH-induced functional recovery. Our observations may
have important therapeutic implications, and may help
translate targeted social interventions to enhance
recovery after ischemic stroke.
