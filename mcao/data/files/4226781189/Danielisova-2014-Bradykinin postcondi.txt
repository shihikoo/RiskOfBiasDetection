The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of bradykinin (BR) postconditioning on cerebral ischemic injury. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by 60 min of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), followed by 3 days of reperfusion. BR as a postconditioner at a dose of 150 lg/kg
was applied intraperitoneally 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after MCAO. BR postconditioning signiﬁcantly reduced
total infarct volumes if applied 3 h after MCAO by 95%, 6 h after MCAO by 80% and 24 h after MCAO
by 70% in versus vehicle group. Neurological functions were a marked improvement in the BR groups
compared to the ischemia group. The number of degenerated neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region
was also signiﬁcantly lower in BR-treated ischemic groups compared to vehicle group. BR postconditioning prevented the release of MnSOD from the mitochondria and reduced the activity of the total SOD and
CAT if it is administrated short time after stroke. Our data proves the ischemic tolerance in the brain
induced by BR postconditioning resulted as effective agent against as strong an attack as 60 min MCAO
even when used many hours after ischemia.

1. Introduction
Bradykinin (BK) is considered an important mediator of the
inﬂammatory response in both the peripheral and central nervous
system, and has attracted recent interest as a potential mediator of
brain injury following stroke (Sobey, 2003; Zausinger et al., 2002).
These characteristics suggest that bradykinin can be effectively
used as a stressor inducing ischemic tolerance after parenteral
application. Numerous reports have conﬁrmed the effect of bradykinin as pre-conditioner and postconditioner in protection of the
heart (Lim et al., 2007; Penna et al., 2007) as well as the brain
(Danielisova et al., 2008, 2012, 2009; Lehotsky et al., 2009).
Bradykinin is a physiologically active nonapeptide with a lot of
functions in the body, synthesized by kallikreins acting on kinogen
precursor molecules. The examinations of cerebral ischemia

demonstrated that an activation of B2 receptor resulted in activation of protein kinase C associated with release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, stimulation of other inﬂammatory mediators, and
release of excitatory amino acids which led to brain damage after
cerebral ischemia (Zausinger et al., 2002). Bradykinin combined
with B2 receptor, subsequently activated protein kinase, accelerated production of NO, and induced mitochondria ATP-sensitive
K+ channel opening to protect the ischemic myocardium. It seems
plausible that bradykinin acts as a primary trigger of delayed preconditioning, and that this effect is mediated by generation of NO
as a signalling intermediate (Baxter and Ebrahim, 2002). Also bradykinin induces ROS, especially superoxide anion generated as a
result of mitochondrial uncoupling through a pathway that
involves activation of protein kinase C isoenzymes, tyrosine
kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (Baxter and
Ebrahim, 2002).
Ischemic tolerance (preconditioning/postconditioning) is the
strongest endogenous neuroprotectant against brain injury after
cerebral ischemia (Gidday, 2006; Perez-Pinzon, 2007). Our previous results show that delayed neuronal death in a model of transient forebrain ischemia simulating cardiac arrest as well as
kainate intoxication can be prevented by postconditioning 2 days
after ischemia. As postconditioners, we used short ischemia,
3-nitropropionic acid, norepinephrine and bradykinin (Burda
et al., 2005, 2009, 2006; Danielisova et al., 2006). It was recently

V. Danielisova et al. / Neurochemistry International 72 (2014) 22–29

demonstrated that ischemic postconditioning protects against
transient focal ischemia simulating stroke (Gao et al., 2008a,b;
Ren et al., 2008, 2009; Zhao et al., 2006), in which ischemic postconditioning is conducted by a series of brief occlusion and release
of the bilateral common carotid arteries after reperfusion. Ideally,
the clinical application of this method of ischemic postconditioning requires that the treatment be applied after the onset of stroke
(Zhao, 2009). Our most recent results documented the efﬁcacy of a
combination of both of these methods of postconditioning (immediate applied just on the onset of reperfusion and delayed applied
2 days after ischemia) in a four-vessel occlusion model of ischemia
(Danielisova et al., 2012).
Transient forebrain ischemia induces delayed neuronal death in
the hippocampal CA1 region. Oxygen free radicals have been suggested to play a signiﬁcant role in this neuronal death (Kim et al.,
1999; Song et al., 2007). In particular, superoxide generated during
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion is implicated. Overexpression of
copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) minimises superoxide toxicity, resulting in a reduction of cell death (Sugawara et al.,
2002). Thus, understanding radical generation and the subsequent
toxicity can lead to therapeutic tools to prevent brain injury
including ischemic insult (Choi et al., 2007).
In this study we examined bradykinin’s ability to induce ischemic tolerance against neuronal injury in a model of transient focal
ischemia. Specially we investigated efﬁcacy of postconditioning if
delayed several hours up to one day. We decided to determine
whether the application of BR postconditioning reduces infarct volume, improvements neurological score and also reduces the activity of total SOD and CAT in the infarct area and penumbra, as well
as in two regions of the hippocampus, the selective vulnerable CA1
region and the relative resistant dentate gyrus in the ipsilateral
hemispheres.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals
Seventy adult male albino Wistar rats weighing 270–300 g were
group-housed and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, with
ad libitum access to water and rodent chow. The experiments were
carried out in accordance with the protocol for animal care
approved by both the Slovak Health Committee (1998) and the
European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC). The animals were randomly subdivided as follows: 4 controls, 6 shamoperated and 60 ischemic.
2.2. Surgical procedures
Transient focal ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal ﬁlament technique
(Longa et al., 1989). Rats were anaesthetised with 4% halothane
in an anaesthetic chamber and maintained during surgery at 1.5%
halothane using a rodent mask. Body temperature was maintained
at 37 °C with a heat pad. MCAO was carried out for 60 min by
inserting a 4–0 nylon monoﬁlament (Lorca Marin, Spain) via the
right external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery to
block the origin of the MCA. Sham-operated controls were treated
similarly to the ischemic group, but the middle cerebral artery was
not occluded.
The Severity of MCA occlusion was conﬁrmed by measuring of
local cerebral blood ﬂow (LCBF) using a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter
(PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed AB, Sweden). A 407 probe with
an adequate holder was situated on the skull over the MCA location
(5 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to bregma). Only rats with blood
ﬂow reduced by more than 80% were used for experiments (data
not shown).

23

In the ischemic group, MCA occluded rats (n = 6) received an
injection (1 ml/kg i.p.) of normal saline as a vehicle. The treated
groups (n = 6 each) were MCA-occluded rats receiving an i.p. injection of 150 lg/kg bradykinin (Sigma–Aldrich Chemie Gmbh, Germany) administered 3, 6, 24 or 48 h after MCA occlusion.
Animals were euthanised for immunochemical studies 3 days after
ischemia.
2.3. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcits
Neurological deﬁcit was assessed in each animal on a numerical
scale of 0–4 at 60 min after MCAO termination and every 24 h
afterwards. The scoring system of Bederson (Bederson et al.,
1986b) was used: 0, no detectable deﬁcits; 1, forelimb ﬂexion
and turning of torso to the contralateral side when lifted by the
tail; 2, same behaviour as grade 1 and decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, same behaviour as grade 2 with unilateral circling;
and 4, no spontaneous walking and a depressed level of consciousness. Rats with a neurological deﬁcit lower than 2 were excluded
from the study.
2.4. Determination of infarct volume
The animals were decapitated under chloral hydrate anaesthesia after 3 days of reperfusion. The brains were rapidly dissected
out and the forebrains were cut into ﬁve coronal sections, 2 mm
thick, using a rat brain matrix (Activational Systems, MI, USA).
Analysis of cerebral ischemic damage was carried out by using
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) (Bederson et al.,
1986a). The sections were stained by incubating them in a solution
of 1% TTC at 37 °C for 15 min and ﬁxed in 10% formalin. For imaging, the sections were scanned by a high-resolution scanner (Hewlett Packard Scanjet). The non-ischemic hemisphere, ischemic
hemisphere and infarct area of each brain section was measured
in a blinded manner, using Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). The average infarct area
(mm2) was calculated by the formula: (infarct area on the anterior
surface + infarct area on the posterior surface):2. The corrected
infarct area in a slice was calculated to compensate for brain
edema (Swanson et al., 1990). Corrected infarct volumes (mm3)
were calculated by multiplying the corrected area by the slice
thickness and summing the volume.
2.5. Fluoro-Jade B staining
Two millimetre coronal sections after TTC staining were transferred to 20% sucrose (w/v) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) until
equilibrated. The tissue was then frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT mounting medium and 10 lm coronal sections were cut and subsequently mounted on gelatinised microscope slides; these were
allowed to air dry, and were then placed in 70% ethanol and ultrapure water for 3 min. The sections were oxidised by soaking in a
solution of 0.06% KMnO4 for 15 min then washed 3 times in ultrapure water for 1 min each and stained in 0.001% Fluoro-Jade B
(Histo-Chem Inc., USA) in 0.1% acetic acid for 20 min. Two millimetre coronal sections after TTC staining were transferred to 20%
sucrose (w/v) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) until equilibrated.
10 lm coronal sections were stained in 0.001% Fluoro-Jade B
(Histo-Chem Inc., USA) by method Schmued and Hopkins
(Schmued and Hopkins, 2000). The slides were subsequently
washed 3 times in ultrapure water for 1 min each wash and dried
overnight at room temperature. The dried sections were cleared by
xylol and cover-slipped with DPX Mountant for histology (Fluka
Chemie AG, Switzerland). The slides were examined using an
Olympus BX 51 microscope with a digital camera DP 50 (Olympus
Optical CO. LTD, Japan). Fluoro-Jade B (FJ-B) positive count was

24

performed by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment
conditions, using Image tool software (UTHSCSA, San Antonio,
USA).
2.6. NeuN immunohistochemistry
Brains were prepared and sectioned as described previously
(see Fluoro-Jade B staining). Cryostat sections (10 lm) at the
level of the dorsal hippocampus were collected onto gelatinised
slides and processed for immunohistochemistry. Air-dried sections were hydrated by soaking in PBS and then incubated in
50% methanol with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS. After washing with PBS
(3 times for 5 min), slides were blocked and permeabilised in
0.1 M PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 4% horse serum
for 1 h. Mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (2 lg/ml; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was applied overnight at room temperature and a secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody was applied for
1 h at room temperature followed by washes in 0.1 M PB. ABC
Elite (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) was applied for
90 min, and then the slides were rinsed with PBS followed by
Tris buffer (pH 7.6), and reacted with DAB Substrate (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH).
2.7. Assay procedure for SOD and CAT activity
Regions from the right (ipsilateral) hemispheres, corresponding to the ischemic core (Ashwal et al., 1998) was separated from
the penumbra by a transverse diagonal cut at approximately the
‘‘2 o’clock’’ position and the ‘‘5 o’clock’’ position. The hippocampus was removed from the brain and immediately cooled to
4 °C, before being transversally split into 200 lm parts, which
were then dissected under a microscope along the hippocampal
ﬁssure into CA1 and DG subregions. Infarct area and penumbra
(distant region), hippocampal CA1 region and gyrus dentate
(DG) were homogenised in the extraction medium containing
0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.8 and then centrifuged at 12,000g
for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the post-mitochondrial supernatant.
The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assay by Sun et al.
(1988). Xanthine–xanthine oxidase was utilised to generate
superoxide ﬂux. The absorbance obtained from nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, p-nitrotetrazolium blue grade III, Sigma) reduction to
blue formazan by superoxide was determined spectrophotometrically at 560 nm at room temperature. The SOD in the sample
competes for superoxide, inhibiting the reaction rate of superoxide with NBT. The rate of NBT reduction in the absence of tissue
was used as the reference rate (0.020 ± 0.005 absorbance/min).
The standard assay substrate mixture contained (in 200 ll): 1 M
xanthine, 0.1 M EDTA, 5.6  10 2 M NBT and 1 M BSA (bovine
serum albumin) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.8). The data
were plotted as percentage inhibition versus protein concentration. One unit (U) of SOD activity was deﬁned as the amount that
reduced the absorbance change by 50%, and results were normalised on the basis of total protein content (U/mg protein). Copper–
zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) was differentiated from
manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) by the addition of
2 mM sodium cyanide to inhibit the activity of CuZnSOD. CuZnSOD activity was calculated as the difference between total SOD
and MnSOD activity.
The catalase activity (CAT) was determined by Goth’s spectrophotometric method (Goth, 1991) in which the supernatant was
incubated with hydrogen peroxide used as the substrate and enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 32 mM ammonium
molybdate. The intensity of the yellow complex formed by molybdate and hydrogen peroxide was measured at 405 nm. CAT activity
is given in U/mg protein.

2.8. Protein assay
Total protein concentrations were determined using the
method described by Bradford (Bradford, 1976) and analyticalgrade bovine serum albumin was used to establish a standard
curve.
2.9. Cell-counting procedure
Positive cell count was performed by an investigator who was
unaware of the treatment conditions, using Image Tool software
(UTHSCSA, San Antonio, USA). Quantiﬁcation of NeuN and Fluoro
Jade positive cells were conducted in the middle of the linear part
of the CA1 ( 3.3 ± 0.2 mm posterior of the bregma). Cells were
counted in the ten hippocampal region slices of each animal and
expressed as the average of positive pyramidal neurons per
1 mm of CA1 length.
2.10. Statistical analysis
The results were represented as mean ± SD. One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test was performed by using GraphPad 3.0 software. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered to be signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of bradykinin on infarct volume and neurological score
Brain sections obtained from MCAO group showed detectable
lesions as white patches in the areas that are supplied by the
MCA. The lesions were present in both the lateral striatum and
the overlying cortex after MCAO (Fig. 1A). Infarct volume was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the BR treated groups 3, 6 and 24 h
after MCAO (Fig. 1B). Neurological scores after MCAO with the
application of BR improved over time during reperfusion and were
signiﬁcantly better in the 3 and 6 h BR groups (P < 0.05) compared
to the 24 and 48 h BR groups or ischemia alone (Fig. 1C).
3.2. Effect of bradykinin on SOD and CAT activities in core and
penumbra
The enzymatic activities of total SOD, CuZnSOD, MnSOD and
CAT were measured 3 days after MCAO treated without or with
the application of BR 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after stroke. Samples were
collected from core (infarct area) and surrounding penumbra of
the brain (Fig. 2). The total SOD activity was signiﬁcantly increased
3 days after 60 min of occlusion in all BR groups compared to control (P < 0.05). However, the application of BR (3, 6 and 24 h after
ischemia) signiﬁcantly prevented an increase of total SOD compared to the ischemic group. A similar situation was also seen for
CuZnSOD enzymatic activity in the brain. The ischemia with and
without BR application signiﬁcantly increased MnSOD activity
compared to control rats, but the application of BR (3 and 6 h) after
MCAO prevented an increase of MnSOD activity in comparison to
the ischemic group of the brain. The changes in the activity of
another important endogenous antioxidant enzyme, CAT, were signiﬁcant and very similar to changes in total SOD (Fig. 2).
3.3. Effect of bradykinin on damaged and surviving neurons in CA1
region
Positive FJ-cells were localised to the pyramidal cell layer of
CA1 (Fig. 3A) of the hippocampus. The application of BR 3, 6 and
24 h after occlusion caused a signiﬁcant decrease in the number

treated animals. Panel B – infarct volume measurement (mm3 ± SD). Note the reduction of volume after BR treatment (n = 6 animals in each group). Panel C – neurological

animals, I – 60 min MCAO + 3 days of reperfusion, I + BR (3, 6, 24, 48 h) – 60 min MCAO + 3 days of reperfusion + BR treatment at signed hours, (⁄P < 0.05).

of positive neurons in comparison to the ischemic group in the hippocampus (Fig. 3B). A massive decrease in the number of NeuN
positive cells was noted in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus after MCAO and 3 days of reperfusion (Fig. 3C). Rats
with BR administration 3, 6 and 24 h later demonstrated a signiﬁcantly increased number of NeuN positive cells in the pyramidal
layer of the CA1 region after MCAO (Fig. 3D) in the hippocampus.
The same number of NeuN positive cells in the pyramidal layer

of the CA1 region was achieved after MCAO and 3 days of reperfusion and after applying BR following 48 h of reperfusion in the hippocampus (Fig. 3C and D).
3.4. Effect of bradykinin on SOD and CAT activities in hippocampus
The enzymatic activities of total SOD, CuZnSOD, MnSOD and
CAT were measured 3 days after MCAO treated without or with

26

increased by 25% in all ischemic groups with or without bradykinin
treatment compared to the control. The activity of CuZnSOD was
markedly increased in the ischemic group and the groups with
the application of BR 24 and 48 h after occlusion in the CA1 region
versus the control, but signiﬁcantly lowers in the groups with the
application of BR 3 and 6 h after occlusion in the CA1 region compared to the ischemic group (Fig. 4). The activity of MnSOD was
markedly increased in all ischemic groups with or without BR
treatment in the CA1 region compared to the control, but only
the application of BR 3 and 6 h after prevented an increase in activity compared to the ischemic group. CuZnSOD and MnSOD activities remained unchanged in the DG after occlusion and the
application of BR. In the case of CAT activity, a signiﬁcant increase
was observed in all ischemic groups with or without BR application
in both regions of the hippocampus compared to the control. The
application of BR 3 or 6 h signiﬁcantly prevented an increase of
CAT (Fig. 4).

3 days of reperfusion without or with the application of bradykinin (BR) at a dose of
150 lg/kg i.p. 3, 6, 24 or 48 h after MCAO. Activity is expressed as international
units per milligram of protein (U/mg). Data are expressed as mean ± SD of six
animals in each group. C – Sham-operated animals, I – 60 min MCAO + 3 days of

the application of BR 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after stroke in the selective
vulnerable CA1 region and the relative resistant dentate gyrus (DG)
of hippocampus (Fig. 4). Signiﬁcantly increased SOD activities were
determined in CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to the
control (P < 0.05). Application of BR 3, 6 and 24 h after ischemia
signiﬁcantly prevented an increase in SOD activity compared to
the ischemic group (Fig. 4). In the DG, the activity of SOD was

Infarction volume in the brain is an important determinant
when assessing the consequences of ischemic stroke, which leads
to severe neuronal damage in the different brain parts with subsequent neurological impairment. The TTC method has been used to
detect infarct areas after ischemic injury. In the present study, the
MCAO group showed a prominent infarct area along with signiﬁcantly altered behavioural outputs. BR treatment (3 and 6 h after
ischemia) not only reduced the infarct area but also improved
behavioural deﬁcits in the MCAO group. Our experiment indicates
that BR administered after cerebral ischemia is effective in reducing infarct volume and leads to improvements in neurological
outcomes.
Injured neurons were identiﬁed using Fluoro-Jade B, a recently
developed ﬂuorescent marker of neuronal degeneration. In the
selective vulnerable CA1 region of the hippocampus, the number
of Fluoro-Jade B positive neurons was signiﬁcantly increased in
the core and penumbra, but BR, as a postconditioner, used 3 or
6 h after occlusion, effectively protected pyramidal CA1 cells
against damage. Histological damage, as measured by Fluoro-Jade
B, reached its peak 24 h after stroke in a reperfusion model of
MCAO in mice (Liu et al., 2009). To quantify the number of surviving neurons, NeuN immunohistochemistry was used. Immunoreactivity for NeuN has been reported to decrease dramatically
following MCAO (Liu et al., 2009). NeuN visualisation demonstrated a massive decrease of surviving neurons in the CA1 region
of the hippocampus 3 days after MCAO. However, BR treatment
early after occlusion (3 or 6 h) prevented the decrease in NeuN
immunoreactivity.
Under physiological conditions, ROS are generated at low levels,
and are controlled by endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and CAT. It is well established that
cerebral ischemia can induce both necrotic and apoptotic cell
death. The mechanisms of cell death after cerebral ischemia
remain unclear; mitochondria play an important role by activating
signalling pathways through ROS production or by regulating
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways. A similar pattern
of post-ischemic SOD activity in the hippocampus and parietal cortex after focal ischemia was observed (Mrsic-Pelcic et al., 2012);
however, a longer time of ischemia could contribute to the slight
variation. Data about the reduced activity of SOD one day after
MCAO in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was published in
the same model (Ashafaq et al., 2012).
Mechanism BR action is through activation of bradykinin-2
(BR2) receptors which can to play a role in ischemic preconditioning. In cascade of its action is couple to protein kinase C (PKC),
nitric oxide production and ROS signalling (Penna et al., 2007).

(SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured in the infarct area and
penumbra, and also in two regions of the hippocampus, the selective vulnerable CA1 region and the relative resistant dentate gyrus
(DG) in the ipsilateral hemispheres. BR application 3 and 6 h after
the end of occlusion prevented the release of MnSOD from the
mitochondria and reduced the activity of total SOD and CAT. All
of these changes were more pronounced if BR was used sooner
after possible occlusion. Signiﬁcantly elevated levels of several proteins in the hippocampus of the MCAO rat model of brain ischemia
on the ﬁrst and third day after insult, including enhanced protein
levels of the CuZn and Mn isoforms of the SOD enzyme, were
detected (Uchida et al., 2010). The role of MnSOD in neural apoptosis prevention and reduced ischemic injury (Huang et al., 2012;
Keller et al., 1998), the extremely elevated MnSOD activity in the
cytoplasm of penumbra cells observed one day after insult is probably connected to progressive neurodegeneration and spread of the
infarct.
Cell death in the penumbra seems to be similar to delayed neuronal death in ischemia selective vulnerable neurons (Du et al.,
1996), which could also be supported by a reduction in the ischemic lesion using stimuli to induce the activation of endogenous
protective mechanisms, known as ischemic tolerance (Zhao,
2009; Zhao et al., 2012).
From the perspective of clinical applications, the utilisation of
immediate postconditioning is practically unusable. Outside of
the hospital it can be impossible and in the clinic very difﬁcult to
identify the exact end of the ischemia. Moreover, there is only an
extremely short therapeutic time window, a few minutes after
the onset of reperfusion. Ren et al. (2008) documented that delayed
postconditioning performed 3 and 6 h after stroke robustly
reduced infarct size, with the strongest protection achieved by
postconditioning with 6 cycles of 15 min occlusion/15 min release.
However, the application of ischemic postconditioning consisting
of brief occlusion/reperfusion patterns on human beings is
unacceptable.
Data from the experimental results show that BR is a powerful
activator of an endogenous defence mechanism known as ischemic
tolerance. Our results conﬁrm that BR postconditioning, if used at
the right time, can prevent the process of delayed neuronal death.
Its effect depends on the severity of ischemic insult; in long-lasting
transient focal ischemia, BR is surprisingly effective if it is used in
the ﬁrst few hours after ischemia. In the shorter (up to 10 min)
transient global ischemia, BR is able to prevent/reverse delayed
neuronal death up to 48 h after ischemia; this is also true for some
models of intoxication (Burda et al., 2009; Danielisova et al., 2009).
Moreover, delayed BR postconditioning can be effectively combined with immediate ischemic postconditioning to prevent apoptosis after global ischemia lasting 15 min (Danielisova et al., 2012).
5. Conclusion
Fig. 4. Enzymatic activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper–zinc
superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
and catalase (CAT) measured spectrophotometrically (optical density 560 nm) in
the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus after 60 min of MCAO
and 3 days of reperfusion with application of bradykinin (BR) at a dose 150 lg/kg
i.p. 3, 6, 24 or 48 h after MCAO. Activity is expressed as international units per
milligram of protein (U/mg). Data are expressed as mean ± SD of six animals in each
group. C – Sham-operated animals, I – 60 min MCAO + 3 days of reperfusion, I + BR
(3, 6, 24, 48 h) – 60 min MCAO + 3 days of reperfusion + BR treatment at signed
hours, ⁄P < 0.05 compared to control; #P < 0.05 compared to ischemia.

Participation of ROS supports also evidence that antioxidants or
ROS scavengers completely block the tolerance acquisition
(Puisieux et al., 2004; Burda et al., 2009). Searching for mechanisms of protection, we measured the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in post-mitochondrial supernatants (PMS).
Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BR administration,
if applied before the onset of irreversible neurodegenerative
changes, induced neuroprotection against ischemic injury. The
ischemic tolerance in the brain induced by BR postconditioning
resulted in a reduction of infarct volume, led to improvements in
neurological score, promoted the survival of ischemic neurons,
prevented the release of MnSOD from the mitochondria and
reduced the activity of the total SOD and CAT.
