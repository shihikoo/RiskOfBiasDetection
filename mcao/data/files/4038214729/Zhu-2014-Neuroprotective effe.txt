Abstract
Stroke is the major cause of death and disability worldwide, and the thrombolytic therapy currently available was
unsatisfactory. 14-3-3e is a well characterized member of 14-3-3 family, and has been reported to protect neurons against
apoptosis in cerebral ischemia. However, it cannot transverse blood brain barrier (BBB) due to its large size. A protein
transduction domain (PTD) of HIV TAT protein, is capable of delivering a large variety of proteins into the brain. In this study,
we generated a fusion protein TAT-14-3-3e, and evaluated its potential neuroprotective effect in rat focal ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) model. Western blot analysis validated the efficient transduction of TAT-14-3-3e fusion protein into brain
via a route of intravenous injection. TAT-14-3-3e pre-treatment 2 h before ischemia significantly reduced cerebral infarction
volume and improved neurologic score, while post-treatment 2 h after ischemia was less effective. Importantly, pre- or postischemic treatment with TAT-14-3-3e significantly increased the number of surviving neurons as determined by Nissl
staining, and attenuated I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis as showed by the decrease in apoptotic cell numbers and the
inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Moreover, the introduction of 14-3-3e into brain by TAT-mediated delivering reduced the
formation of autophagosome, attenuated LC3B-II upregulation and reversed p62 downregulation induced by ischemic
injury. Such inhibition of autophagy was reversed by treatment with an autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP), which also
attenuated the neuroprotective effect of TAT-14-3-3e. Conversely, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibited I/
R-induced the increase in autophagic activity, and attenuated I/R-induced brain infarct. These results suggest that TAT-14-33e can be efficiently transduced into brain and exert significantly protective effect against brain ischemic injury through
inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and autophagic activation.

Over-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and BclxL have been shown to promote cell survival after focal cerebral
ischemia [16], [17], whereas Bcl-2 knockout exacerbated brain
damage in stroke [18]. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated
that Bcl-xL protein fusing to the protein transduction domain
(PTD) of HIV TAT was protective in ischemia models [19], [20].
Therefore, targeted inhibition of apoptotic pathways may provide
an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic
brain injury.
14-3-3e is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which bind to
proteins and modulate interaction between proteins involved in
various cellular functions such as intracellular signaling, cell
cycling, apoptosis and transcriptional regulation [21], [22].
Proteomic analysis showed that 14-3-3e expression is decreased
approximately 50% in brain of a neonatal rat hypoxia/ischemia
model [23], and the up-regulation of 14-3-3e protein in brain
protects cells against apoptosis [24]. 14-3-3e is able to inhibit
apoptosis by binding and sequestering phosphorylated Bad in the
cytoplasm, thus preventing Bad translocation to mitochondria and
interaction with Bcl-xL [24], [25]. Therefore, 14-3-3e
may function as an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis, and its

Introduction
Stroke is responsible for more than 5 million deaths each year
worldwide, making it the second leading cause of death and a
major cause of disability [1]. This situation is becoming worse in
the aged due to the increasing prevalence of some risk factors, like
hypertension, coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis [2], [3].
Thrombolytic therapy is the only approved treatment for acute
ischemic stroke [4], [5]. However, restoration of blood flow
following thrombolytic treatment may aggravate the initial injury
and lead to a second damage called I/R injury [6]. Neuroprotective approaches, as prospective newer treatments for stroke,
have shown promise in animal models in recent decades, but their
efficacies in patients remain limited [7]. Hence, there is an urgent
need to develop effective neuroprotective agents to prevent and
treat stroke.
Apoptosis has been suggested to be one of the main contributors
to neuronal death in acute ischemic stroke [8], [9]. Strong
evidence for neuronal apoptosis is seen in numerous I/R animal
models [10], [11]. Moreover, apoptosis is evident in patients
suffering from ischemic stroke [12], [13]. During stroke, a number
of apoptosis regulatory gene products are activated [14], [15].

TAT-14-3-3e Protein on Ischemic Stroke

over-expression may be a promising strategy for treating ischemic
stroke.
However, 14-3-3e is unable to cross the BBB due to its large
molecular weight of 30-kDa [21]. Protein transduction across BBB
through PTDs is emerging as an attractive drug delivery strategy
in various diseases or injuries [26]. The PTD sequence derived
from HIV TAT protein is capable of delivering a large variety of
proteins or peptides into the brain [27]. A number of TAT fusion
proteins, such as TAT-Bcl-xL [19], [20], TAT-GDNF [28], TatHsp70 [29], TAT-XIAP [30], TAT-neuroglobin [31], TATPARK7 [32], TAT-SOD [33] and TAT-NBD [34], [35], have
been shown to efficiently cross the BBB after systemic administration and exhibit neuroprotective efficacy in cerebral ischemia
animal models.
Autophagy, a cellular lysosome-mediated process, degrades and
recycles subcellular organelles [36]. Increasing findings suggest
that autophagy is activated following cerebral ischemia, but the
contribution of autophagy to neuronal death/survival is still under
debate [37], [38], [39], [40]. Recent studies have reported that 143-3e is involved in the down-regulation of autophagy [41], [42].
However, little is known whether the regulation of autophagy by
14-3-3e has protective or detrimental effects on ischemic brain
injury.
Whether 14-3-3e can be delivered into brain by TAT and TAT14-3-3e fusion protein has a protective effect against cerebral I/R
injury is not known. In the present study, we prepared a TAT-143-3e fusion protein, and evaluated its ability to cross BBB and
transduce into the brain. We further examined the neuroprotective
effect of TAT-14-3-3e against rat transient focal cerebral ischemia.
We demonstrated for the first time that systemic delivery of TAT14-3-3e protein results in a significant neuroprotection, indicating
that TAT-14-3-3e could be developed as a potential therapeutic
agent in brain ischemic injury.

Construction of TAT–14-3-3e Fusion Protein Expression
Vectors
The 855 bp coding sequence of TAT-14-3-3e fusion protein,
which contains a 66histidine tag leading sequence, followed by
11-amino-acid TAT-PTD and 14-3-3e, was obtained by PCR. An
oligonucleotide coding for a flexible spacer Gly-Gly-Ser was
inserted to flank TAT 59 and 39, respectively. Restriction sites were
added into the PCR primers to give the PCR products containing
59 end NdeI and 39 end BamHI sites. The PCR product was
subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI digested pET-30a(+) plasmid
(Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) resulting in recombinant expression vector pET-TAT-14-3-3e. In addition, another plasmid pET14-3-3e coding for a 14-3-3e control protein was constructed in a
similar way. The insert in all the constructs was verified by DNA
sequencing.

Expression and Purification of TAT–14-3-3e/14-3-3e
Fusion Proteins
The plasmid pET-TAT-14-3-3e/pET-14-3-3e was transformed
into the E. coli BL21(DE3). A single clone was grown for 8 h at
37uC in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin.
These cultures were diluted 50-fold with fresh LB media and
cultured at 37uC to OD600 = 0.8. The expression of TAT-14-3-3e
and 14-3-3e were induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) for 10 h at 28uC. The bacterial cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 10,0006g, and then resuspended in
pre-cooled binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl and
20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) and lysed by sonication on ice.
The supernatant containing target protein was collected by
centrifugation 15,0006g for 20 min at 4uC and loaded onto a
Ni2+-NTA resin column (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with binding
buffer. The proteins were then eluted by a stepwise imidazole
gradient in elution buffers (20 mM Na3PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 50–
500 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Eluted fractions were analyzed by
12% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining.
Fractions that contained target protein were then pooled and
dialyzed against water using a 5 kDa molecular weight cutoff
dialysis membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) at 4uC thoroughly.
The purified proteins were lyophilized and kept at 280uC. The
proteins were dissolved in normal saline (NS) and the protein
concentrations were estimated by BCA protein assay (M&C Gene
Technology, Beijing, China) before used, and the protein purity
was also evaluated by SDS/PAGE. The purified recombinant
proteins were confirmed by Western blot using anti-His-tag
antibody (1:1000, Abgent, CA, USA) and anti-14-3-3e antibody
(1:3000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The experimental designs and all procedures were in accordance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals approved by Beijing Committee on Animal Care and
Use. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics
of Animal Experiments of the Peking University Health Science
Center (Permit Number: LA2013-69). Efforts were made to reduce
the number of animals used and their suffering.

Codon Optimization and Cloning of Human 14-3-3e Gene
The sequence encoding human 14-3-3e gene (GenBank
accession number NR_024058) was generated by PCR. In order
to facilitate the protein expression in E. coli, we modified the least
preferred codons into the most preferred ones without changing
amino acid sequence, according to the codon usage in E. coli [43].
A two-step strategy combining assembly PCR and overlap
extension PCR process was used. A long codon-optimized DNA
sequence was divided into three fragments with size from 200 to
350 bp, which was assembled via PCR reactions using 45 and 60
mer oligonucleotides (Table S1). There was a 15–20 bp overlap
for each of the oligonucleotides used. These three fragments were
assembled into a full-length DNA sequence by overlap extension
PCR. The 768 bp fragments was ligated into the pEASY-T1
cloning vector (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) by TA cloning
and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) using the intraluminal
filament technique as described previously [48]. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.), and the body
temperature of rats was maintained at around 37uC with a heating
pad and monitored by a rectal thermometer during surgery. The
right common, external, and internal carotid arteries were exposed
and common and external carotid arteries were permanently
ligated with sutures. A 4-0 monofilament nylon suture with a
rounded tip was introduced into the internal carotid artery
through an incision in the common carotid artery and advanced
20–21 mm gently until the rounded tip reached the entrance to
the right MCA. The monofilament was gently removed after 2 h
to allow reperfusion of MCA, and the external carotid arteries was
permanently ligated. Sham-operated rats were subjected to the

same experimental procedures without the occlusion of MCA.
After the surgery animals were returned to their home cages and
closely monitored for 4–6 h.

Evaluation of Neurological Deficit
The animals were subjected to a neurological examination after
24 h reperfusion using an established scoring system [49], and the
observer was blinded to the identity of the treatment groups.
Neurological deficit was scored on a 5-point scale (0, no
neurological deficit; 1, failure to extend right paw fully; 2, circling
to right; 3, falling to right; 4, unable to walk spontaneously and
having depressed levels of consciousness).

Animals and Experimental Groups
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g, Department of
Laboratory Animal Science of Peking University, Beijing, China)
were given free access to food and water. Rats were randomly
assigned to five groups: sham operated group, vehicle group (NS
treated), 14-3-3e treated group, and TAT-14-3-3e treated group
before or after ischemia (group I–V, respectively). Animals were
sacrificed at 24 h of reperfusion after 2 h transient cerebral
ischemia. Both 14-3-3e and TAT-14-3-3e were dissolved in NS.
Intravenous injection of 0.3 ml NS (vehicle group), or 10 mg/kg
14-3-3e (14-3-3e treated group), or 10 mg/kg TAT-14-3-3e (TAT14-3-3e pre-ischemic treated group) was performed 2 h before
MCAO. In group V (post-ischemic treated group), 10 mg/kg
TAT-14-3-3e was intravenously injected at the end of ischemia.
In addition, the transduction of TAT-fusion protein across BBB
often exhibits a significant increase at 4 h after administration
[19], [28], [31], [44]. In order to corroborate the transduction of
TAT-14-3-3e, additional rats were injected intravenously with
10 mg/kg TAT-14-3-3e or 14-3-3e. At 4 h after injection, these
animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with NS,
and the cerebral hemispheres were quickly removed for Western
blot analysis.
To determine whether the protective effects of TAT-14-3-3e
against transient focal cerebral ischemia is related to autophagy
inhibition, rats were randomly assigned to the sham, vehicle, 3MA and RAP + TAT-14-3-3e groups. The treatment protocols
and dosages of 3-MA and rapamycin were selected according to
published studies [45], [46], [47]. The 3-MA (600 nmol, 5 ml,
Sigma, M9281) or vehicle (normal saline, 5 ml) was administered
using a single intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.) injection at the onset
of reperfusion. 3-MA was dissolved in normal saline by heating
solution to 60–70uC and cooled to room temperature immediately
before treatment. Rapamycin (35 pmol, 5 ml, i.c.v.) combined with
TAT-14-3-3e (10 mg/kg, i.v.) was delivered 2 h before MCAO,
and then followed by 24 h reperfusion. Rapamycin (Sigma,
R0395) was first dissolved in ethanol and then diluted in normal
saline solution (the final ethanol concentration ,2%).

Infarct Volume Analysis
After scoring neurological function, the animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially
perfused with NS. Brains were collected rapidly and sectioned into
five 2-mm-thick coronal slices, and stained with 1% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) (Amresco, Solon, CA, USA)
at 37uC for 30 minutes. The slices were fixed in 4% formalin
overnight and then photographed with a digital camera (PowerShot G12, Canon). Unstained areas (pale color) were defined as
ischemic lesions. The areas of the infarction were analyzed using
Image J software (NIH Image), by measuring the surface of each
slice and numerically integrated across the thickness of the slice to
obtain the infarct volume. Volumes from all five slices were
summed to calculate total infarct volume over the entire
hemisphere, expressed as mm3. To compensate for the effect of
brain edema, the corrected infarct volume was calculated as
follows: the corrected infarct volume = volume of contralateral
hemisphere – (volume of ipsilateral hemisphere – volume of
infarct) [50].

TUNEL staining
Rats were anesthetized deeply with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
(n = 3). Then brains were removed and fixed in 10% buffered
formalin solution for 48 h, and then embedded in paraffin.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to investigate the
apoptosis according to the protocol of in situ apoptosis detection kit
(KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China). Brains were cut into 10 mm
thick coronal sections at the level of the bregma, and then
incubated with a TUNEL mixture containing 0.5 U/ml TDT,
0.2 nmol biotin-11-dUTP, followed by streptavidin-FITC. TUNEL staining was detected under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus IX71). Three sections from each animal were viewed by
two observers blinded to the origin of the slides. For each section,
the TUNEL positive cells were counted in 10 non-overlapping
high-power fields (6200) covering the majority of striatum.

Western Blot Analysis for In Vivo Transduction
Transduction of the TAT-14-3-3e fusion protein was verified
using Western blot analysis. Proteins were extracted from the
cerebral hemisphere in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% C24H40O4?Na, 0.1% SDS,
2 mM Na4P2O7, 25 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4
and 1 mM PMSF) 4 h after intravenous injection of TAT-14-3-3e
or 14-3-3e. Equal amounts of protein (40 mg) were diluted in
66sample buffer, boiled and separated by 12% (wt/vol) SDS/
PAGE, and then blotted onto PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). The membrane was then immersed in
blocking solution [5% milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 + TBS)] for
2 h at room temperature, followed incubated with a monoclonal
rabbit anti-14-3-3e antibody (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
rabbit anti-His-tag antibody (1:1000, Abgent, CA, USA) or rabbit
anti-b-actin antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA,
USA) overnight at 4uC. Subsequently, membranes were incubated
with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), followed
by ECL detection (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The density of
each band was quantified using the Quantity One software.

Caspase-3 Activity Assay
The activity of caspase-3 was detected using a Caspase-3
Colorimetric Assay Kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China)
following the manufacturer’s instruction. Proteins were extracted
from fresh right cortical samples 24 h after MCAO (n = 4). Tissues
were homogenized in cold lysis buffer containing 25 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton 100, 2 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM PMSF. The homogenates were
centrifuged at 13,000 6g for 30 min at 4uC, and the supernatants
were collected. The protein concentration was determined by
BCA assay (M&C Gene Technology, Beijing, China) and adjusted
to 2 mg/ml. Then 100 mg proteins were added to 50 ml 26Reaction Buffer supplement with 5 ml Caspase-3 Substrate and then
incubated at 37uC away from light for 4 h. Caspases-3 activities
were quantified spectrophotometrically at a wave length of
405 nm in a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,

antibody (1:500, Abgent, CA, USA) were used for immunoreactivity detection.
TEM was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes. After
24 h of reperfusion, rats were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed
by transcardial perfusion with 50 ml NS followed by 50 ml of
fixative (2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde). Next, the
cerebral fragments were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution
overnight at 4 uC, followed by immersion in 1% osmium tetroxide
in 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h. The tissues were
dehydrated in ascending series of ethanol before embedding
samples in araldite. The ultrathin sections were cut and doubly
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a
JEM-1400 type transmission electron microscope (Electron Co,
Japan) and photographed.

14-3-3e protein was detected. The results suggest that TAT-14-33e efficiently crosses intact BBB and transduces into brain after
administrated intravenously and wild-type 14-3-3e without TAT
cannot cross BBB. Next, the levels of total 14-3-3e protein in the
ischemic brain were examined by Western blotting, and the results
showed that the levels of exogenous 14-3-3e protein were
increased in TAT-14-3-3e treated rats (Figure 2C). We further
confirmed that there was no significant difference of the
transduction of TAT-14-3-3e in the brain between TAT-14-3-3e
pre-treated 2 h before ischemia and post-ischemic treatment at the
end of ischemia (Figure 2D).

Protection of TAT-14-3-3e Fusion Protein against Focal
Ischemic Injury
To determine whether the increased 14-3-3e protein levels in
the brain can protect neurons against ischemic damage, we
examined infarct volume and neurological deficits after treatment
with recombinant 14-3-3e proteins in rat focal cerebral I/R
model. We first detected the function of TAT-14-3-3e at three
doses (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) (Figure 3B). A significant reduction of
infarct volume was reached at 10 mg/kg, and less reduction at
5 mg/kg. Additional increase in the dose to 20 mg/kg did not
result in an additional significant protection against the focal
ischemic damage. Thus the following experiments were performed
at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The animals treated with vehicle or control
14-3-3e protein developed severe infarct involving the cerebral
cortex and striatum, and the brain infarct volumes and neurological deficits showed no significant difference between them
(Figure 3). In contrast, pre-treatment with TAT-14-3-3e 2 h
before ischemia significantly reduced infarct volumes (Figure 3A
and B). In addition, post-ischemic treatment of the animals with
TAT-14-3-3e at the end of ischemia reduced brain infarct volume,
but the protective effect appeared not as strong as that in pretreatment. Similarly, animals pre-treated with TAT-14-3-3e
showed a significant improvement in neurological functions
(Figure 3C), indicating a consistent and significant correlation
with the infarct size. There was also a trend towards a reduction of
neurological deficits in TAT-14-3-3e post-treatment group. We
examined the neuronal survival by cresyl violet (Nissl) staining.
Accordingly, the number of surviving neurons in the striatum was
significantly increased in either TAT-14-3-3e treatment groups
versus vehicle or control 14-3-3e groups (Figure 4A and B). Taken
together, pre-treatment with TAT-14-3-3e significantly protects
against focal cerebral ischemic injury and improves neuronal
survival.

Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as means 6 SD. The one way ANOVA
was used to test for differences among groups, followed by post hoc
Scheffe’s tests. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Generation of Pure TAT-14-3-3e and 14-3-3e Fusion
Proteins
Codon-optimized 14-3-3e DNA sequence was generated by a
two-step PCR strategy as shown in Figure 1A, and has been
deposited in the GeneBank (accession number KC733246). We
constructed TAT-14-3-3e fusion protein, in which 14-3-3e was
fused in frame with TAT-PTD domain and 66His-tag, and 14-33e fused to His-tag alone as a negative control (Figure 1B). Both
protein-coding sequences were cloned into pET-30a(+) vector for
protein expression. The recombinant fusion proteins were
expressed mainly in soluble form when induced by IPTG at
28uC (Figure 1C). After purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, only one single band appeared for both TAT-14-3-3e
and 14-3-3e protein, as determined by Coomassie brilliant blue
stained SDS/PAGE (Figure 1C). Recombinant TAT-14-3-3e and
14-3-3e proteins showed a molecular mass of approximately
31 kDa and 29 kDa, respectively. The purified fusion proteins
were further corroborated by Western blot analysis with anti-Histag and anti-14-3-3e antibodies (Figure 1D).

Efficient Transduction of TAT-14-3-3e Fusion Protein into
Brain In Vivo
Western blot analysis using anti-14-3-3e antibody showed that
the expression levels of endogenous 14-3-3e protein in brain tissues
of I/R rats were decreased by half (Figure 2A), confirming
previous report [23]. To detect whether the TAT-14-3-3e could
pass BBB, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-14-3-3e
and anti-His-tag antibodies. At 4 h after intravenous injection of
TAT-14-3-3e or 14-3-3e (both His-tagged), the brain was
thoroughly flushed with NS by perfusion to exclude the potential

immunoreactivity was detected in the brain lysate after intravenous injection of TAT-14-3-3e, and 14-3-3e treated animals did
not show specific His-tag immunoreactivity (Figure 2B). In TAT14-3-3e-treated animals, two visible bands were detected in the
brain using anti-14-3-3e antibody, and the upper robust band
exhibited virtually identical to TAT-14-3-3e, with a molecular
mass of 31 kDa, and the lower band was endogenous 14-3-3e
protein. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the relative intensities
of each band indicated that the exogenous TAT-14-3-3e level was
about 3 times higher than the endogenous 14-3-3e protein.
However, in 14-3-3e-treated control animals, only the endogenous

Effect of TAT-14-3-3e on Neuronal Apoptosis in Ischemic
Brain
To explore the cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective efficacy of TAT-14-3-3e, we examined the apoptotic death
by using TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity colorimetric
assay. The number of apoptotic cells in the striatum zone was
significantly reduced in both pre-treatment and post-ischemic
treatment groups with TAT-14-3-3e, as compared with vehicle or
control 14-3-3e protein treated group (Figure 5A and B). The
caspase-3 activity in both TAT-14-3-3e treated groups was also
found to be significantly decreased, as compared with that in
vehicle or control 14-3-3e treated animals. Besides, both the
apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activity in TAT-14-3-3e pretreatment animals were significantly less than that in TAT-14-33e post-treatment group, implying that pre-ischemic treatment
with TAT-14-3-3e more effectively protects against neuronal

apoptosis before it occurs. These data collectively demonstrate that
TAT-14-3-3e attenuates I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis.

The protein expression levels of the membrane-bound form
LC3B-II were significantly increased in the ischemic cerebral
hemisphere 24 h after I/R as compared with sham control group.
Pretreatment with TAT-14-3-3e significantly but partially blocked
ischemic injury-induced up-regulation of LC3B-II (Figure 6B and
C). The protein levels of Beclin-1, a positive regulator of
autophagy [51], [52], were significantly increased at 24 h after
ischemic brain injury. Pretreatment with TAT-14-3-3e did not
produce any significant effect on ischemia-induced up-regulation
of Beclin-1 expression (Figure 6B and E). Accordingly, treatment
with TAT-14-3-3e increased the levels of p62 (Figure 6B and D), a
protein selectively degraded by autophagy [53]. These results
indicated that increased 14-3-3e protein in the brain inhibits I/Rinduced autophagy.
We further tested whether the regulation of TAT-14-3-3e on
autophagy contributed to the neuroprotective effect of TAT-14-33e in ischemic stroke. First, we determined the effect of autophagy
on ischemic injury in a rat model using autophagy inhibitor 3-MA.
Rats were subjected to 2 h MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion.

Effect of TAT-14-3-3e on Autophagy in Cerebral Ischemia
To further delineate the neuroprotective mechanisms of TAT14-3-3e in ischemic brain damage, we examined the effect of
TAT-14-3-3e on I/R-induced autophagy by TEM analysis and
Western blot analysis with autophagy specific antibodies against
microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 3 (LC3), autophagerelated gene 6 (Atg-6)/Beclin-1 and p62/SQSTM1. Ultrastructural analysis (Figure 6A) with TEM showed that neuronal
morphology appeared to be normal in the sham group. At 24 h
after I/R, cell shrinkage, loss of cellular organelles and formation
of autophagosomes were observed in the ischemic penumbra of
cerebral cortex. However, most of the neurons and their organelles
appeared to be normal in the TAT-14-3-3e treated group, with a
less neuronal damage. In addition, autophagosomes were less
frequently observed than that in I/R groups. Concurrent increase
of both LC3 and Beclin-1 represents activation of autophagy [51].

recombinant protein expression/purification technology. TAT-143-3e readily crossed BBB and effectively transduced brain
following intravenous injection even under intact BBB conditions.
Pre- or post-ischemic treatment with TAT-14-3-3e significantly
reduced cerebral infarct size and improved neurologic outcomes in
a rat focal cerebral I/R model. Such neuroprotection is attributed
to the improved neuronal survival due to the significant reduction
of neuronal apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 activity, and the
inhibition of autophagy. These data confirm the neuroprotective
effect of 14-3-3e via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis in vivo [24], [54],
and provide first evidence that engineered TAT-14-3-3e fusion
protein could be developed as a novel therapeutic agent for the
treatment of stroke and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.
TAT-mediated transduction is able to cargo large molecules
such as proteins across cell membranes, and is becoming a
promising tool for the therapy of many diseases [27], [55]. In
ischemic stroke, therapeutic drugs are required to enter the central
nervous system. Thus TAT-mediated delivery is of particular

down-regulated (Figure 8A, B and D) and p62 expression was upregulated in the 3-MA group (Figure 8A and C), which confirmed
that 3-MA block the autophagy activation in cerebral I/R [45],
[46], [47]. However, there was no significant difference in the
expression of LC3B-II, Beclin-1 and p62 among the vehicle and
RAP + TAT-14-3-3e groups, suggesting that the inhibition of
autophagy activation in ischemic brain mediated by pretreatment
with TAT-14-3-3e was partly reversed by autophagy inducer
rapamycin (Figure 8). The present study further demonstrates
that the neuroprotection induced by TAT-14-3-3e pretreatment,
at least partly, mediated by inhibition of autophagy activation in
a rat I/R model.

Discussion
The salient finding in this study is the significant neuroprotection of TAT-14-3-3e against focal cerebral ischemia. We prepared

can be very meaningful. TAT conjugated proteins can enter
primary neurons, astrocytes and cultured neuronal cell lines in
vitro, such as TAT-Bcl-2gloop [59], TAT-Hsp70 [29] and TATDJ-1[60]. Others have observed that TAT-Bcl-xL [19] and TATXIAP [30] were detected both in a large number of neurons and
some astrocytes in vivo. Besides, there were still many TAT fusion
proteins showing effect in animal model, but the cellular
distribution of these proteins was not yet analyzed, such as
TAT-GDNF [28] and TAT-NEP1-40 [61]. As TAT proteins
enter various cell types in a non-selective manner with high
efficiency [62], we speculate that TAT-14-3-3e protein may be
transduced into all cells in brains, including neurons, astrocytes,

significance, due to its high efficiency in crossing intact BBB [56],
[57], [58] and easy transduction in cells. In this study, the fusion
protein contains a His-tag, which allows immunodetection of the
transduced protein to be distinguished from endogenous 14-3-3e.
The exogenous 14-3-3e fused to TAT-PTD was delivered
efficiently into the intact brain when administrated peripherally,
as confirmed by Western blot analysis showing 3-fold increase of
14-3-3e in brain at 4 h after intravenous injection. The efficient
transduction of TAT-14-3-3e fusion protein supports previous
reports showing that transduction of TAT-Bcl-xL [19] and TATNeuroglobin [31] into the intact brain peaks at 4 h after
administration. Therefore, TAT-14-3-3e holds high potential for
clinical applications. Figuring out the target cells of TAT-14-3-3e

transduction of TAT-14-3-3e provides a strong neuroprotective
effect. In addition, post-ischemic treatment with TAT-14-3-3e also
exhibits a protection against brain ischemia, although it is less
effective. As there is no significant difference in the transduction of
TAT-14-3-3e in the brain under ischemic and non-ischemic
conditions, the data suggest that less effective of post-ischemic
TAT-14-3-3e treatment is not due to the possibility of lower levels
of delivered TAT-14-3-3e in the injured brain tissues. Neurons are
highly sensitive to ischemia and hypoxia injury, so the earlier
intervention in the pathological process begins, the better
therapeutic effect is obtained. The inferior effectiveness of TAT14-3-3e post-ischemia treatment is most probably due to ongoing
loss of Neurons. However, the underlying mechanisms need
further investigation.
Accumulating evidences suggest that 14-3-3e displays important
anti-apoptotic characteristics [21], [63], [64]. Our results showed
that TAT-14-3-3e reduced the TUNEL-positive cells significantly,
implying that TAT-14-3-3e could prevent the apoptotic modes of
neuronal cell death in rats. Previous studies have demonstrated
that 14-3-3e binds to p-Bad, resulting in retention of p-Bad in the
cytoplasm and preventing Bad from entering mitochondria, and
thus prevent the subsequent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
[21], [24], [25]. Caspase-3 is an important and common effector
in the process of apoptosis, and its inhibition can block apoptotic
cell death [65]. Our study proves that intravenous administration
of TAT-14-3-3e decreased caspase-3 activity in brain I/R, by both
pre-ischemic and post-ischemic treatments. Taken together, these
results indicate that TAT-14-3-3e can exert neuroprotective effect
in ischemic brain through inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.
Autophagy has a beneficial role or adverse effect in cerebral
ischemia, depending on various pathological conditions [39], [40].
There is, however, robust evidence that excessive autophagy leads
to neuronal death in cerebral ischemia [66], [67], and downregulation of autophagy can attenuate damage in rat focal
ischemic brain and oxygen-glucose deprived astrocytes [52],
[46], [47], [68]. In this study, we observed that blockade of
autophagy by 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, could partly protect
brains from I/R-induced Injury, suggesting that inhibition of
autophagy seems to be neuroprotective in a rat model of 2 h
ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. Recent investigations showed that
14-3-3 family proteins are also regulators of autophagy [41], [42].
However, the role of each 14-3-3 isoform in autophagy is not
clear. Herein we report for the first time that pharmacological
elevation of 14-3-3e in the brain attenuates ischemia-induced upregulation of autophagic activity, which is consistent with the latest
reports showing that 14-3-3e may be involved in autophagy downregulation in HeLa [41] and gliocytoma U251 cells [69].
Moreover, we found that TAT-14-3-3e treatment plus rapamycin,
a widely used chemical to induce autophagy [70], increased infarct
size, and enhanced the autophagic activity when compared with
TAT-14-3-3e-only treatment, suggesting that rapamycin attenuates the neuroprotective effect of TAT-14-3-3e and inhibition of
autophagy is involved in the mechanism of TAT-14-3-3e.
However, TAT-14-3-3e attenuated LC3B-II upregulation induced
by ischemic injury but had no effect on injury-induced upregulation of Beclin-1. Such a different effect of TAT-14-3-3e on LC3BII and Beclin-1 may reflect different signal pathways for autophagy
in rat ischemia model. 14-3-3e was shown to bind to both Beclin-1
and intermediate filament proteins [41]. 14-3-3e is also found to
interact with chloride intracellular channel protein 4, which then
binds to and retains Beclin-1 [69]. The free Beclin-1 binds to
vacuolar sorting protein (VPS34), a class III phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K), and forms a core kinase complex which is
essential for the induction of autophagy [71]. Since 14-3-3e

oligodendrocytes, microglia/macrophages, neural stem/progenitor cells, endothelial cells and ependymal cells.
Consistent with previous reports [23], [24], there is a half
reduction in 14-3-3e expression after ischemic brain injury in the
present animal models, and the increase of 14-3-3e in brain
significantly protects against ischemic damage [24]. So it would be
attractive and beneficial to rapidly achieve a high and therapeutic
level of 14-3-3e in the ischemic brain. The present results
demonstrated that pre-ischemic administration of TAT-14-3-3e
significantly reduces the brain ischemic infarct volume, improves
neurologic scores and increases neuronal survival, suggesting the

strongly binds to Beclin-1, this binding may effectively reduce the
levels of free Beclin-1 (available for autophagy induction) and
sequester Beclin-1 away from the complex, leading to inhibition of
autophagy and thus contributes to the neuroprotective effect of
TAT-14-3-3e. Further investigations are needed to precisely reveal
the mechanisms of 14-3-3e in autophagy.
In summary, TAT-14-3-3e was prepared and transduced into
the brain efficiently, and it exhibited significant protective effect
against cerebral I/R injury in rats. The mechanisms underlying
the neuroprotection of TAT-14-3-3e in brain ischemia may be
attributed to its inhibition on neuronal apoptosis and autophagy.
TAT-14-3-3e might be a new pharmaceutical target for the

treatment of not only stroke but potentially other human injuries
and diseases.
