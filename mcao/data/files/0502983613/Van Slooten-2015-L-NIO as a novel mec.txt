Background: Ischemic stroke is the most frequent cause of persistent neurological disability in Western societies. New treatment strategies are required and effective in vivo models are crucial to their
development.
New method: The current study establishes a novel in vivo rat model of focal striatal ischemia using the
vasoconstrictive agent N5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (l-NIO). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received
a unilateral intrastriatal infusion of l-NIO in combination with jugular vein occlusion.
Results: l-NIO infusion was associated with zero mortality, low surgical complexity and a reproducible
infarct, providing advantages over established models of focal ischemia. The mean infarct volume of
8.5 ± 5.3% of the volume of the contralateral striatum resulted in blood–brain barrier dysfunction, neuronal hypoxia and ongoing neurodegeneration. Further characteristics of ischemic stroke were exhibited,
including robust microglia/macrophage and astroglial responses lasting at least 35 days post-ischemia,
in addition to chronic motor function impairment.
Comparison with existing methods: When compared to other models such as the MCAo models, the consistency in regions affected, high success rate, zero mortality, reduced surgical complexity and minimal
welfare requirements of the l-NIO model make it ideal for initial high-throughput investigations into
preclinical efﬁcacy and proof of principle studies of acute ischemic stroke interventions.
Conclusion: We propose that the l-NIO rat model of focal striatal ischemia does not replace the use of other
ischemic stroke models. Rather it provides a new, complementary tool for initial preclinical investigations
into the treatment of ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects 17 million people globally every year (Feigin et al., 2014). Intravenous

recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only
approved pharmacological treatment available for acute ischemic
stroke. However the strict criteria for treatment, including a 4.5 h
therapeutic window from onset of symptoms, means that few
patients are eligible to receive rtPA (Lees et al., 2010). The high
prevalence of stroke, together with the associated social and economic burden, necessitates the development of novel therapies to
reduce cell loss, promotes brain repair and enhances functional
recovery. Effective in vivo models of ischemic stroke play a crucial role in the development of new therapeutic strategies. As such,
there is a need for high-throughput, reliable models of ischemic

stroke that produce focal infarcts commonly found in surviving
human patients with the potential for recovery (Carmichael, 2005).
The most widely used in vivo model of focal ischemic stroke
is the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model, of which
there are several versions (Howells et al., 2010). While occlusion
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) can result in a high rate of
successful infarct induction with low mortality and good reproducibility, this approach can be technically challenging, requiring
signiﬁcant surgical skill, as well as being time-consuming, therefore reducing throughput (Carmichael, 2005; Howells et al., 2010).
The MCAo model also has the signiﬁcant disadvantage of damaging
multiple brain regions including the hypothalamus, which interferes with temperature regulation and hampers the assessment of
regional drug-effects (Gerriets et al., 2003). In addition, embolic or
thrombotic models produce variable results, due to limited control over clot formation or the timing and extent of reperfusion
(Beech et al., 2001). Alternatively, intracerebral injection of a vasoconstrictive agent, such as endothelin-1, can produce consistent
ischemic lesions without the requirement for extensive and technical surgical manipulation (Fuxe et al., 1992). Targeted intracerebral
injection of endothelin-1 can be used to mediate vasoconstriction
of either the MCA or a particular tissue target, resulting in focal
ischemia (Fuxe et al., 1992; Sharkey and Butcher, 1995). However, a major concern regarding the use of endothelin-1 is potential
receptor-mediated effects on endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes that are involved in both the pathophysiology of stroke and repair processes (Carmichael, 2005; Gadea et al.,
2009; Hammond et al., 2014).
An alternative vasoconstrictive agent, N5-(1-iminoethyl)-lornithine (l-NIO), has recently been used to induce focal ischemia
in the subcortical white matter of the mouse (Hinman et al., 2013;
Rosenzweig and Carmichael, 2013). l-NIO is a potent non-selective
inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (Alderton et al., 2001;
Rees et al., 1990) that induces local vasoconstriction at the site of
infusion. Intravenous administration of l-NIO has been shown to
increase mean arterial blood pressure and decrease regional cerebral blood ﬂow in adult rats (Alderton et al., 2001; Rees et al., 1990;
Oyama et al., 2010). Moreover, l-NIO increases infarct volume when
administered to rats prior to MCAo (Greco et al., 2011). While l-NIO
has been used to induce white matter stroke in the corpus callosum
of mice (Hinman et al., 2013; Rosenzweig and Carmichael, 2013), to
date it has not been examined whether an intrastriatal infusion of lNIO can induce focal ischemia in the striatum of the adult rat brain.
Different brain regions exhibit differing sensitivities to ischemia,
for example, cortex versus striatum (Skelding et al., 2012).
We therefore proposed that intrastriatal infusion of l-NIO could
be used to induce a consistent focal ischemic infarct in rats, exhibiting characteristics seen in currently available models of stroke,
including blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage, hypoxia, neuronal
degeneration, glial cell activation, functional impairment and the
potential for neuroprotection. Generation of a NOS inhibitor model
of focal cerebral ischemia would provide an alternative mechanism
by which to identify and trial new therapeutic agents. The ability to
establish a highly reliable model requiring minimal surgical manipulation would also allow for high-throughput production and drug
screening, aiding in the advancement of stroke research.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Experimentation was performed in strict compliance with the
University of Auckland Animal Ethics Guidelines, in accordance
with the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act 1999, and conformed
to international guidelines on the ethical use of animals. All efforts

45

were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–350 g) were used in
these studies. The animals were housed in groups (n = 5 per cage)
in a temperature and humidity-controlled room that was kept on
a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum
throughout.
2.2. l-NIO model surgical procedures
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by unilateral permanent
ligation of the external jugular vein and stereotaxic infusion of
l-NIO into the striatum. Anesthesia was induced using 5% isoﬂurane in oxygen gas at a ﬂow rate of 4 L/min and maintained at
1.5–3.5% isoﬂurane, 0.8 L/min. Body temperature was maintained
during surgery via a rectal probe and homeothermic feedback system set to 37 ◦ C (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Heart
rate and oxygen saturation were measured and recorded throughout the surgery using a veterinary pulse oximeter (L.R. Instruments,
Melbourne, Australia). The right external jugular vein was permanently ligated with 5–0 silk suture (Resorba, Nuremberg, Germany)
through a ventral incision. The animal was then placed dorsal side
up in a stereotaxic frame. l-NIO was injected directly into the striatum through a small craniotomy, using a Hamilton syringe with
a 32 gauge needle (Hamilton, NV, USA), at a rate of 500 nl/min.
Sham surgery consisted of the same surgical procedures with sterile
saline (0.9%) injected in place of l-NIO.
2.3. l-NIO dose determination
N5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (l-NIO; Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile saline at the required concentration. A range of
doses of l-NIO from 0.04 to 2.0 ␮mol per rat, in volumes from
3.0 to 5.0 ␮l (n = 3–6/group) were trialed in either single or double site injection paradigms (single site: anterior–posterior (AP)
+0.7 mm, medial–lateral (ML) −3.2 mm and dorsal–ventral (DV)
−5.5 mm relative to Bregma; double site; AP +1.0 mm, ML −3.2 mm,
DV −5.5 mm and AP +0.5 mm, ML −3.2 mm, DV −5.5 mm relative to Bregma). Sham-lesioned animals (n = 3/group) were used
for comparison. The ﬁnal dose used for histological and functional
characterization of the model over time was 2.0 ␮mol of l-NIO
in 5 ␮l sterile saline at each site. Treatment groups included animals that had undergone l-NIO-induced ischemia or sham surgery,
culled between 1.5 h and 35 days post-ischemia.
2.4. MK801 injections
On the day of injection, (+)-MK801 hydrogen maleate powder (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline
at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and ﬁlter-sterilized. Intraperitoneal
injections of MK801 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle were performed 30 min
prior to the commencement of l-NIO infusion for pre-treatment
paradigms and 10 min or 1 h following the l-NIO infusion for posttreatment paradigms (n = 3–5/group). Animals were culled 3 days
following surgery.
2.5. Motor function
Rotarod and cylinder tests were performed on rats that had
undergone focal ischemia or sham surgery and normal control rats
that had not undergone surgery (n = 7–9/group). Both tests were
performed 1 week prior to surgery (baseline), 1 week post-surgery
(acute) and 4 weeks following surgery (chronic). Animals were
culled 5 weeks post-surgery. All procedures were performed in the
12 h dark cycle and the light cycles were synchronized between
housing and testing areas. The rotarod paradigm included a 3 day
training regime of 3 trials per day on the rotarod (IITC Life Science

46

A.R. Van Slooten et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 245 (2015) 44–57

Inc., CA, USA) at 12 rpm and a 2 day testing regime of 2 trials per
day with the rod accelerating from 4 rpm to 40 rpm. For the cylinder test, animals were placed in a plexiglas cylinder (30 cm high and
20 cm internal diameter) and were left alone to explore for 5 min
while being videotaped. Mirrors were placed so that animals could
be ﬁlmed from all angles. An investigator blinded to the treatment
group later recorded the number of times each forepaw was used
to initiate weight-shifting movements including rearing, wall contact and landing. The use of both paws together was scored as both
a left and a right paw movement. Ipsilateral asymmetry was determined as the percentage of occasions where the right, unaffected
ipsilateral paw was used to initiate the movement.

−0.54 mm relative to Bregma). The infarct volume was estimated
by (1) multiplying the distance between the sections by the sum of
the cross-sectional area of the infarct across all sections; (2) multiplying this volume by the ratio between left and right striata to
correct for edema; and (3) expressing the volume as a percentage
of the contralateral striatum to correct for differences between animals and tissue processing (Golanov and Reis, 1995; Swanson et al.,
1990). Edema was calculated by expressing the difference in volume between striata as a percentage of the contralateral striatum
volume (Golanov and Reis, 1995).

2.6. Tissue processing

DAB–nickel sulfate immunohistochemistry was performed to
analyze the expression of GFAP and Iba1 on six consecutive sections
per animal that encompassed the infarct core (+1.38, +1.06, +0.74,
+0.42, +0.10, and −0.22 mm relative to Bregma). Virtual images of
the ipsilateral striatum were created using a 10× objective lens
and the striatum was manually outlined using ImageJ. The area of
immunoreactivity as a percentage of the total area of the striatum
was calculated for each section and results were expressed as the
mean percentage area of immunoreactivity. For GFAP, the area of
the GFAP-devoid core was subtracted from the area of the striatum,
and the area of GFAP was presented as a percentage of this reduced
area outside the infarct core. The area of the GFAP-devoid core was
also presented as a percentage of the area of the striatum.

Rats were culled by an overdose of sodium pentobarbitone
(60 mg/ml) and were transcardially perfused with ice-cold sterile saline, followed by freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were extracted and ﬁxed overnight
in 4% paraformaldehyde, then transferred to 30% sucrose solution for sectioning. Coronal sections (40 ␮m) were cut on a sliding
microtome. Eight sets of sections were collected from each brain
(320 mm between consecutive sections). Immunohistochemistry
with either DAB–nickel sulfate or ﬂuorescent imaging was performed on free-ﬂoating sections using antibodies against NeuN
(Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), DARPP-32 (Merck Millipore),
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Merck Millipore), parvalbumin
(Swant, Marly, Switzerland), neuronal NOS (nNOS; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), calretinin (Swant), RECA-1 (AbD Serotec,
Oxford, United Kingdom), serum albumin (AbD Serotec), HIF1␣ (Merck Millipore), Iba1 (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom)
or GFAP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). A Nikon Eclipse E800 was
used to obtain images of DAB–nickel sulfate-treated sections and
confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000) was used for imaging ﬂuorescent labels. Sequential scanning was used to minimize overlap
between signals from multiple channels during acquisition of confocal images.
For the TTC assay, fresh brain tissue was sectioned coronally at
1 mm thickness using a brain matrix. The slices were soaked in a
2% TTC solution for 25–30 min at room temperature. The tissue was
then ﬁxed by removing the TTC solution and adding 10% formalin.

2.9. Semi-quantitative analysis of glial cell activation

2.10. Exclusion criteria
A priori exclusion criteria for these studies included: premature mortality due to the surgical procedures (n = 0); surgical miss
(no detectable infarct or an infarct equivalent to or smaller than the
sham infarct; n = 4); infarct volume greater than two standard deviations from the mean of the treatment group (n = 0); and injury to
the contralateral hemisphere (n = 0). Animals were excluded from
the rotarod analysis if their latency to fall off the rotarod during the
testing phase was more than two standard deviations outside the
mean on more than one trial (n = 1) and from the cylinder analysis
if they reared ﬁve or fewer times during the 5-min period analyzed
(n = 3; one from each treatment group).
2.11. Statistics

2.7. Fluoro-Jade C staining for neurodegeneration
Fluoro-Jade C staining was performed on coronal sections containing the striatum (n = 3 sections per animal: anterior, center
and posterior striatum). Sections were mounted onto polylysine
slides which were oven-dried at 50 ◦ C, rehydrated in distilled water,
and placed in 0.06% potassium permanganate (Sigma–Aldrich) for
10 min. Sections were then stained with a 0.0001% solution of
Fluoro-Jade C (Merck Millipore). The number of Fluoro-Jade Clabeled neurons per section was counted using a counting frame
on a ﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE-2000) under 40×
magniﬁcation.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics
v21 (IBM Corporation, NY, USA). Levene’s test for equality of variances was performed on all data. For comparison of two groups, an
independent samples two-tailed t-test was used. For comparisons
between more than two groups, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed
for motor function results. Post hoc analyses were performed with
either Tukey’s test or the Games–Howell test if non-equal variances
were found. Non-equal variances and non-parametric tests were
used where appropriate. All data are presented as mean ± standard
deviation. Results were considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05.

2.8. Quantiﬁcation of ischemic infarct

3. Results

DAB–nickel sulfate immunohistochemistry was performed for
quantiﬁcation of the ischemic infarct. The area of the infarct was
delineated as a region of decreased NeuN immunoreactivity. Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience Inc., VT, USA) was used to create
virtual sections from images taken using a 4× objective lens on a
Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. ImageJ software was used to manually outline the ischemic infarct, right ipsilateral striatum and
left contralateral striatum through the anterior–posterior extent
of the striata (+1.70, +1.38, +1.06, +0.74, +0.42, +0.10, −0.22, and

3.1. l-NIO dose determination
This study aimed to establish an l-NIO model of focal ischemia
that produced a consistent, moderate infarct contained within
the rat striatum and resulted in a measurable functional deﬁcit.
NeuN immunohistochemistry was used to delineate the area of
neuronal injury and thus determine infarct volume. No infarct
was detected with a single infusion of l-NIO within the dose
range of 0.04–0.150 ␮mol (n = 3–6/group, data not shown) 3 days

A.R. Van Slooten et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 245 (2015) 44–57

post-surgery. Consequently, the dose was increased (0.5–2.0 ␮mol
l-NIO) and the delivery sites altered to a double infusion paradigm
(n = 3–5/group). The highest l-NIO dose of 2.0 ␮mol was the only
dose that produced an infarct signiﬁcantly different in volume from
sham animals (8.5 ± 5.3% of the contralateral striatum compared to
the sham volume of 0.7 ± 0.3%; Fig. 1A and E).
The response of microglia/macrophages to intrastriatal infusion
of l-NIO was investigated by analyzing Iba1 immunoreactivity. In
accordance with infarct volume, only the highest dose of l-NIO
(2.0 ␮mol) produced a microglial/macrophage response that was
signiﬁcantly different from that of sham animals (5.9 ± 2.4% of the
striatal area compared to 1.8 ± 0.6% for sham; Fig. 1B).
Tissue sections were also analyzed for GFAP immunoreactivity to investigate reactive astrogliosis. All three l-NIO doses
(0.5–2.0 ␮mol) induced a signiﬁcant astroglial response, with the
greatest extent of GFAP immunoreactivity observed at the lowest
dose of l-NIO (0.5 ␮mol), where GFAP immunoreactivity covered
11.0 ± 2.0% of the striatal area outside the lesion core compared
to 3.9 ± 1.5% in sham animals (Fig. 1C). A core area devoid of GFAP
immunoreactivity was also evident in the center of the l-NIO infarct
that was not apparent in sham animals. The mean area of the GFAPdevoid core was signiﬁcantly different between the highest l-NIO
dose and the sham group, with an area of 18.8 ± 13.0% of the striatum in l-NIO treated animals compared to 0% for shams (Fig. 1D).
The two lower l-NIO doses also produced a core area devoid of GFAP
(approximately 3.0–5.0%).

3.2. Physiological monitoring
Based on these results, 2.0 ␮mol of l-NIO in 5 ␮l of sterile saline
was injected at two sites in the striatum in all further investigations.
To document the physiological parameters during l-NIO surgery,
data from all animals in the current study that underwent l-NIO
or sham surgery were pooled (l-NIO n = 25, sham n = 17). To this
end, rectal temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation were
measured at intervals throughout the surgery (Table 1). The only
parameter that was signiﬁcantly different between the l-NIO and
sham groups was the rectal temperature at the start of surgery. At
this point l-NIO had not yet been injected, and the values were
no longer different at the ﬁnish of surgery just after l-NIO infusion, therefore this difference is unlikely to have inﬂuenced the
outcome of l-NIO-induced ischemia. Oxygen saturation was close
to 97% in both groups at both time points. Heart rate and oxygen saturation did not vary between groups or across time points.
Animals that received l-NIO lost a mean 2.3 ± 2.3% of their body
weight in the 24 h following surgery; a value that was not significantly different to sham animals (Suppl. Fig. 1). They rarely lost
any further weight and tended to increase in weight from 24 h
onwards.

3.3. Mortality and success rate
There was zero mortality associated with focal ischemia induced
by l-NIO infusion. No animals had to be removed from the immunohistochemical analysis due to the a priori exclusion criteria of
premature mortality, infarct volume outside two standard deviations from the mean or damage in the contralateral hemisphere.
Exclusions were made only on the basis of rare surgical misses
occurring in 4 out of the 152 animals on which this procedure was
performed. The rate of successful induction of l-NIO ischemia can
therefore be estimated at 97%.

47

3.4. l-NIO infarct volume
Using the 2.0 ␮mol dose of l-NIO, we characterized the temporal
proﬁle of lesion development following local intrastriatal infusion
of l-NIO. We observed that the infarct was consistently restricted to
the striatum, apart from partial extension into the adjacent globus
pallidus in 6 out of 25 animals. This was conﬁrmed using a TTC
assay at 24 h and 3 days post-lesion (Suppl. Fig. 3). The infarct core
3 days post-ischemia spanned a range of 1 mm (+0.75 to −0.25 mm
relative to Bregma; Fig. 1E). Assessment of infarct volume 3 days
post-ischemia revealed an infarct of 8.5 ± 5.3% of the volume of the
contralateral striatum, signiﬁcantly greater than the sham infarct
volume (0.7 ± 0.3%; Fig. 1F). There was no signiﬁcant difference
in infarct volume from 3 to 35 days post-ischemia, however, 35
days post-ischemia 12.3 ± 8.0% of the striatal volume had been lost
in animals that had undergone l-NIO-induced ischemia compared
to 4.1 ± 2.1% in sham animals (Fig. 1G). This suggests that tissue
volume was progressively lost over time, and supporting this, we
observed changes in infarct morphology over time course (Fig. 1H).
The pale region devoid of NeuN immunoreactivity appeared to condense in area from 7 to 35 days, coincident with the loss of tissue
volume.
Finally, we investigated whether jugular occlusion was necessary in the l-NIO model. Interestingly we observed that there was
no difference in infarct volume or striatal tissue volume when l-NIO
injections were performed without jugular vein occlusion when
compared to l-NIO injected animals that received a jugular vein
occlusion (Suppl. Fig. 2) indicating the lesion effect is primarily due
to l-NIO-induced vasoconstriction.

3.5. BBB leakage
Blood leakage from vessels in the striatum was investigated at
acute time points, 1.5 and 6 h post-ischemia, using immunohistochemistry for rat endothelial cell antigen 1 (RECA-1) and serum
albumin. At 1.5 h post-ischemia, serum albumin leakage into the
brain parenchyma was observed in the vicinity of the needle tract
only (Fig. 2A). However, 6 h following ischemia, extensive leakage of serum albumin, at least 500 ␮m from the needle tract,
was observed. Accumulated leakage of serum albumin was also
observed from 24 h to 14 days post-ischemia (results not shown).
No serum albumin was detected within the contralateral striatum
at any time point (Fig. 2A). These observations suggest that leakage
through the BBB begins between 1.5 and 6 h post-ischemia.

3.6. Hypoxia
Cellular hypoxia was examined using immunohistochemistry
for the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1␣). HIF-1␣ was detected at very low levels within the ipsilateral
striatum both 1.5 and 6 h following ischemia, and was noticeably
increased when assessed 24 h post-ischemia (Fig. 2B). When HIF1␣ was co-labeled with the neuronal nuclei marker NeuN, close to
100% of the identiﬁed HIF-1␣-positive cells were also positive for
NeuN (Fig. 2C). Some of the NeuN/HIF-1␣ co-labeled cells appeared
to be more irregular in shape than HIF-1␣ negative, NeuN-positive
cells, suggesting that only injured neurons, or possibly phagocytic
cells, initiate the HIF-1␣-induced cellular response to hypoxic conditions within 24 h of ischemia. Interestingly, not all neurons in the
infarct site appeared hypoxic even after 24 h. HIF-1␣ immunoreactivity was not observed in the contralateral striatum.

3.7. Neuronal degeneration and loss
Fluoro-Jade C was used to identify the presence of neurodegeneration following ischemia. Fluoro-Jade C was present in very
low levels 1.5 and 6 h post-ischemia and only in the immediate
vicinity of the needle tract (data not shown). However, after 24 h,
Fluoro-Jade C could be detected throughout the infarct, becoming
prominently expressed from 3 days post-ischemia (Fig. 3A) and
remaining so until 35 days post-ischemia. The maximum number of
Fluoro-Jade C positive cells occurred 7 days post-ischemia (Fig. 3C).
A low level of Fluoro-Jade C staining was also seen in the shamlesioned animals (Fig. 3D), however, at all time points the number
of Fluoro-Jade C positive cells in l-NIO lesioned animals was signiﬁcantly greater than in sham (Fig. 3B). Fluoro-Jade C staining was not
observed in the contralateral hemisphere. These ﬁndings indicate
that neurodegeneration continues for at least 35 days following
l-NIO-induced focal ischemia.
We investigated the presence of DARPP-32-positive medium
spiny striatal neurons as well as striatal interneurons within the
l-NIO lesioned striatum in order to deﬁne the sub-types of neurons affected by focal ischemia. Seven days following ischemia,
there was an obvious region of pallor indicating an absence of
DARPP-32 within the infarct, similar to that observed with NeuN
immunoreactivity This loss of DARPP-32 expression was still evident within the infact 35 days following ischemia, indicating that
medium spiny neurons are sensitive to l-NIO lesioning (Suppl.
Fig. 4A). Parvalbumin- and calretinin-positive interneurons were
also affected by l-NIO-induced ischemia, with a reduction in both
cell populations observed in the lesioned striatum 7–35 days following l-NIO administration (Suppl. Figs. 4B and 2C). In addition,
nNOS interneurons also exhibited susceptibility to l-NIO-induced
ischemia, but with a delayed response, with loss of nNos not
detected until 35 days following ischemia (Suppl. Fig. 4D). In contrast, we observed only a moderate loss of cholinergic interneurons
by 35 days post-ischemia (Suppl. Fig. 4E).

3.8. Inﬂammatory response to ischemia: glial cell activation
Glial cell activation plays a major role in propagating the inﬂammatory response to cerebral ischemia. By 1.5 h following focal
ischemia, we observed that Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages
immediately adjacent to the infarct had changed in morphology
and undergone hypertrophy, indicating a response to ischemic
injury (Fig. 4A). After 3 days, microglia/macrophages were clearly
present in the core of the infarct, as indicated by up-regulation of
Iba1 in comparison to the contralateral striatum and sham animals (Fig. 4A and B). A ramiﬁed morphology was observed for
Iba1-positive cells in the contralateral striatum, in the infarct of
sham animals and some regions of the ipsilateral striatum (at early
time points and/or distant from the infarct core; Fig. 4C), whereas
Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages within the l-NIO infarct had
an amoeboid or phagocytic morphology (Fig. 4D). Three days

post-ischemia, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in the striatal
area covered by Iba1 immunoreactivity in l-NIO lesioned animals
compared to sham-lesioned animals (5.9 ± 2.4% versus 1.8 ± 0.6%;
Fig. 4E). Even after 35 days, Iba1 immunoreactivity was still signiﬁcantly elevated in l-NIO animals compared to sham. Thus there
is a distinct microglial/macrophage response speciﬁcally to l-NIOinduced ischemia that lasts at least 35 days following ischemia.
3.9. Reactive astrogliosis
Reactive astrogliosis was investigated by analyzing GFAP
expression following ischemia. GFAP expression appeared to
decrease in the infarct core 6–24 h following ischemia, while
increasing in the region surrounding the core from approximately 3 days post-ischemia, compared to sham controls (Fig. 5A
and B). Astrocytes in the contralateral striatum were bushy and
globe-shaped with ﬁne processes (Fig. 5C). In contrast, astrocytic
processes in the ipsilateral l-NIO lesioned striatum, and those close
to the sham infarct, appeared to have undergone hypertrophy from
1.5 h post-ischemia (Fig. 5A and D). Polarization of peri-infarct
astrocytic processes toward the infarct core was also observed
(Fig. 5E).
A signiﬁcant change in the extent of GFAP immunoreactivity was
seen 3–35 days post-ischemia compared to sham controls (Fig. 5F).
Three days following ischemia, GFAP immunoreactivity covered
7.9 ± 2.5% of the ipsilateral striatum, peaking at 12.5 ± 3.5% 7
days post-ischemia, but remaining elevated 35 days post-ischemia.
This indicates the presence of a chronic post-ischemic astroglial
response that appears to be maximal 1 week following ischemia.
Consistent with an evolving astroglial response, there was a large,
distinct core area devoid of GFAP immunoreactivity 3 days postischemia that declined in size over time (Fig. 5A and G) and was
absent in sham animals.
3.10. Functional impairment resulting from the l-NIO infarct
For a model of stroke to be relevant to the clinical situation, it is
imperative that a deﬁcit in function is identiﬁed that can potentially
be improved by experimental stroke therapies. The signiﬁcant role
of the striatum in motor function suggests that any deﬁcit from
a striatal infarct is likely to have a motor component. Therefore,
two different functional paradigms were used to evaluate motor
performance.
Rotarod test: The rotarod test was used to identify whether
animals developed a motor impairment affecting their ability to
run. No impairment was identiﬁed on the rotarod test between
treatment groups (Fig. 6A). However, there was a signiﬁcant difference between time points for each group individually (p = 0.033;
Fig. 6B). The sham group declined in performance immediately
post-surgery, demonstrating a signiﬁcant decrease in fall latency
from 88 ± 32 s at baseline to 45 ± 30 s 1 week post-surgery (Fig. 6B).
This may be related to the anesthetic and/or surgical intervention, as they did not decline further. Interestingly, the group that
received l-NIO infusions declined signiﬁcantly in performance 4
weeks post-ischemia (fall latency of 81 ± 28 s at baseline versus

46 ± 26 s 4 weeks post-ischemia). This suggests that there may be a
long-term functional deﬁcit that warrants further investigation on
a more sensitive test of motor function.
Cylinder test: Forelimb use during spontaneous exploration was
investigated using the cylinder test (Schallert et al., 2000). A signiﬁcant difference was found between the treatment groups over
time in use of the unaffected, ipsilateral forelimb when all types
of weight-shifting movements (rearing, ﬁrst wall contact and landing) were combined (p = 0.037, Fig. 6C). The ipsilateral limb was
used to initiate movement signiﬁcantly more often in the l-NIO
group compared to the no surgery control group 1 week postsurgery (64.6 ± 17.7% versus 40.6 ± 10.7%, respectively). However,

this difference was no longer present 4 weeks post-surgery. A
longer-lasting deﬁcit was found when the forelimb used to ﬁrst
contact the wall upon rearing was analyzed separately from rearing
and landing movements (Fig. 6D). There was a signiﬁcant difference
between treatment groups over time (p = 0.041), with ipsilateral
forelimb use increasing in the l-NIO group compared to the no
surgery control group from 1 week post-ischemia (74.8 ± 25.4%
versus 34.3 ± 27.3%, respectively) and remaining signiﬁcantly elevated for at least 4 weeks post-ischemia. When rearing and
landing movements were analyzed individually, no differences
were detected between treatment groups (Fig. 6E and F). These data
suggest that there is a chronic functional deﬁcit induced by l-NIO

movements.
3.11. Neuroprotection
With the exception of rtPA, no compounds have yet translated
from preclinical studies into the clinic. Neuroprotective compounds

that have shown promise preclinically have been shown to do
so using animal models that have large infarcts extending into
multiple brain regions. Few studies have shown promise at minimizing damage to the striatum; therefore we assessed the potential
of MK801 to induce neuroprotection following a striatal stroke.
Neuroprotection has been shown previously in rodent models of
focal ischemia when compounds are given just prior to and/or
just following ischemia (Shuaib and Hussain, 2008). We therefore

investigated whether the l-NIO model was amenable to neuroprotection with either pre- or post-ischemic administration of the
NMDA receptor antagonist MK801.
Pre-treatment with MK801 30 min prior to infusion of l-NIO
produced no signiﬁcant difference in infarct volume between
treatment groups (Fig. 7A). However, a signiﬁcant difference was
found in infarct volume between treatment groups when MK801
was administered following ischemia (p = 0.002). Administration
of MK801 10 min post-ischemia resulted in a signiﬁcant increase
in infarct volume in l-NIO lesioned animals (31.5 ± 14.4%) compared to untreated l-NIO lesioned and sham-lesioned animals
(8.5 ± 5.3%; Fig. 7B and C) suggesting an interaction of MK-801
with l-NIO, or the induction of hypertension in anaesthetized animals. However, there was no difference in infarct volume between
vehicle-treated l-NIO lesioned animals and l-NIO lesioned animals administered MK801 10 min following ischemia. In contrast,
treatment with MK801 1 h following l-NIO infusion resulted in
a signiﬁcant decrease in infarct volume (1.6 ± 1.9%) compared to
the group that received MK801 10 min post-ischemia (Fig. 7B and
C). However, post-treatment with MK-801 1 h following l-NIOinduced ischemia did not reduce infarct volume when compared to
vehicle-treated l-NIO lesioned or untreated l-NIO lesioned animals.
4. Discussion
We have described the characterization of an ischemic
infarct produced by stereotaxic infusion of the NOS inhibitor lNIO into the rat striatum. l-NIO-induced ischemia resulted in

acutely compromised BBB function and hypoxia, in addition to
chronic neurodegeneration and inﬂammation as demonstrated
by microglial/macrophage and astroglial responses. A subtle but
chronic impairment in forelimb use was also demonstrated postischemia.
Infusion of l-NIO into the striatum, combined with ipsilateral
jugular vein occlusion, consistently generated a moderate-sized
infarct within the lateral striatum with occasional incorporation of
the globus pallidus. Unlike the MCAo models, there was no involvement of the amygdala, thalamus, cortex, or hypothalamus, reducing
the likelihood of interfering with temperature regulation (Gerriets
et al., 2003) and potentially making the assessment of regional
drug-effects easier. The l-NIO model was also associated with zero
mortality, a high success rate and good recovery. Furthermore, the
l-NIO model may offer an advantage over the closely related ET-1
model of ischemia due to the potential receptor-mediated effects
of ET-1 on multiple cell types involved in the pathophysiology of
stroke and repair processes (Carmichael, 2005; Gadea et al., 2009;
Hammond et al., 2014). We observed no signiﬁcant variation in
infarct volume over 35 days following ischemia. This suggests that
the majority of cell death contributing to the infarct volume has
occurred by 3 days post-ischemia, though inﬂammation may contribute to ongoing tissue injury. In support, tissue atrophy was
observed long-term.
The effect of l-NIO administration on BBB leakage was investigated to assess acute ischemic pathophysiology. The BBB appeared
to become compromised between 1.5 and 6 h following ischemia,
as demonstrated by extensive extravasation of serum albumin from

56

A.R. Van Slooten et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 245 (2015) 44–57

the vasculature into the brain parenchyma 6 h, but not 1.5 h, postischemia. ET-1 induced focal ischemia in the striatum does not
appear to result in BBB disruption (Hughes et al., 2003) demonstrating another advantage the l-NIO model may provide over the
ET-1 model.
We also investigated the occurrence of hypoxia following l-NIO
infusion. The transcription factor HIF-1␣, which regulates cellular
adaption to hypoxia (Lenihan and Taylor, 2013), was abundantly
expressed preferentially in ipsilateral striatum neurons from 24 h
onwards. In order to determine whether neuronal degeneration
continued long term, degenerating neurons were identiﬁed by
staining for Fluoro-Jade C. Fluoro-Jade C was expressed within the
infarct from 24 h, becoming prominent from 3 to 35 days following ischemia, indicating that neurodegeneration occurs long term
following l-NIO-induced ischemia. We further examined which
neuronal sub-types were speciﬁcally affected in the l-NIO model
and found that DARRP-32 medium spiny neurons in the striatum
were lost by 7 days following ischemia, as has also been found following ET-1-induced striatal ischemia (Fuxe et al., 1992). nNOS,
parvalbumin and calretinin interneurons were also susceptible to
l-NIO-induced ischemia with only ChAT interneurons exhibiting
a resistance to ischemic injury. These results are consistent with
reports that striatal interneurons are more resistant to ischemia
than striatal projection neurons (Satoshi et al., 1993).
Consistent with other models of focal ischemia, l-NIO
induced a chronic microglial/macrophage and astroglial response.
Changes in the morphology and location of Iba1-positive
microglia/macrophages were evident within hours of ischemia
and Iba1 immunoreactivity was consistently elevated from 3 to
at least 35 days following l-NIO administration. Early changes in
morphology and location, and the increase in expression of Iba1
are consistent with previous reports of microglia being the most
numerous glial cell type in the ﬁrst 24 h following MCAo in mice
(Gelderblom et al., 2009) and responding to injury earlier than
astrocytes (Sozmen et al., 2009). The inﬂammatory response thus
clearly begins in the hours following l-NIO-induced ischemia and
continues long-term. GFAP-positive astrocytes were lost in the core
region from around 6 h following ischemia. Conversely, from 24 h,
GFAP immunoreactivity increased in the peri-infarct region, to form
a border indicative of reactive gliosis that was obvious 3 days postischemia. The astroglial border was so distinct that it may provide
an alternative means of quantifying infarct volume. ET-1 induced
white matter stroke shows a very similar time course of astrocytic
activation (Sozmen et al., 2009). The astroglial response observed
is also consistent with results from Schroeter et al. (1995), who
observed formation of a distinct GFAP-positive ring around the
lesion infarct and a remote increase in GFAP immunoreactivity 3
days following photothrombotic focal ischemia. Chronic astrogliosis and the formation of an astroglial border has also been observed
in the striatum following both ET-1 and MCAo-induced ischemia
(Fuxe et al., 1992; Clark et al., 1994). We observed the core area bordered by astrocytes decreased in size until it was no longer present
after 35 days. It is not possible to say from this data whether the
reduction in the core area is due to tissue loss, migration of astrocytes or proliferation of endogenous astrocytes. Recent research
suggests that astrocytes may not migrate in response to injury
but proliferate and relocate their processes to form glial borders
(Bardehle et al., 2013; Wanner et al., 2013).
We investigated the potential for neuroprotection following lNIO-induced ischemia by administration of the NMDA receptor
antagonist MK801. MK801 has been shown to have different effects
depending on whether animals are anesthetized or not; it may
cause hypotension in conscious animals but hypertension in anesthetized animals (Park et al., 1988). Therefore the ischemic infarct
could have been exacerbated by the 10 min injection paradigm
because animals were still anaesthetized, whereas 1 h later the

animals received injections when they were conscious. Studies
using MCAo models have typically found that neuroprotection
declines over time but protection has been shown with MK801 as
late as 1 h following permanent MCAo (Hatﬁeld et al., 1992). The
lack of MK801-induced neuroprotection in the l-NIO model may
have been a result of the small infarct volume or the differing sensitivities to ischemia between brain regions (Skelding et al., 2012).
An important next step would be to investigate alternative neuroprotective agents in this model to conﬁrm if neuroprotection can
be induced following striatal stroke through other mechanisms.
In conclusion, we have introduced a novel rat model of striatal
focal ischemia. When compared to other models with similar histological and inﬂammatory proﬁles such as the MCAo models, the
consistency in regions affected, high success rate, zero mortality,
reduced surgical complexity and minimal welfare requirements of
the l-NIO model make it ideal for initial high-throughput investigations into preclinical efﬁcacy and proof of principle studies of
acute ischemic stroke interventions. For better generalization to
the clinical condition, it is important to test putative therapeutic
strategies in a range of focal ischemia models. We therefore propose
the l-NIO model does not replace the use of other ischemic stroke
models in the preclinical phase, rather it is complementary. The
l-NIO model may provide a useful initial in vivo model, followed
by thromboembolic models that are closer to the human etiology
but are more difﬁcult to generate. It has been suggested that MCAo
models represent malignant infarction and not the smaller, more
treatable infarcts which are most common in humans; therefore
small, focal models such as the l-NIO model are also important for
clinical translation (Carmichael, 2005). Involvement of the striatum
in human stroke has been demonstrated in approximately 24% of
patients and a predominantly striatal infarct associated with mild
neurological deﬁcits has been shown in 8% of patients (Delavaran
et al., 2013). Therefore, the striatal location of the l-NIO-induced
infarct and associated subtle functional deﬁcit are relevant to types
of human stroke. As such, use of the l-NIO model of focal ischemic
stroke provides an alternative strategy to aid in the advancement
of stroke research.
