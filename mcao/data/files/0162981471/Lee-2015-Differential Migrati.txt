To evaluate the optimal timing of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation following
stroke, rats were transplanted with MSCs at 1 (D1), 4 (D4), and 7 days (D7) after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Rats in the D1 group showed a better functional recovery
than those in the D4 or D7 groups after MCAo. MSCs preferentially migrated to the cortex in
the D1 group, while the MSCs in the D4 or D7 groups preferentially migrated to the striatum.
Interestingly, the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the cortex was highest
at 1 day after MCAo, while the level of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the striatum
was lowest at 1 day after MCAo and then increased over time. The pattern of MCP-1 and
SDF-1 level changes according to the time after MCAo was consistent with in vivo and in
vitro migration patterns of MSCs. The results suggest that an earlier MSC transplantation
is associated with a better functional recovery after stroke, which could be explained by
the preferential migration of MSCs to the cortex in the early transplantation group. The
time-dependent differential expression of MCP-1 and SDF-1 between ischemic regions
seemed to mediate the differential migration of MSCs. Highest level of MCP-1 at one day of
stroke may induce preferential migration of MSCs to the cortex, then better functional
improvement.

Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been viewed as potential candidates for cell therapy in
cases of ischemic stroke since it was known that MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM) can
differentiate into neuronal and glial lineage cells [1]. Researches has indicated that transplanting MSCs after cerebral ischemia induction can reduce infarct size and improve functional
outcomes in animal cerebral ischemia models [2–4]. The proposed mechanisms for these

beneficial effects of MSCs include neuroprotection, angiogenesis, and stimulation of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis [5–8].
Investigators have explored the effect of MSC transplantation on functional recovery in animal models at various time points after stroke [9–11]. In the first clinical study by Bang et al.,
patients were transplanted with autologous BM-derived MSCs at 4–5 and 7–9 weeks after the
onset of stroke [12]. Patients who were given MSC transplants showed a greater functional
recovery than the control group, and there were no deaths, stroke recurrences, or serious
adverse effects in the treatment group. In this trial, BM-derived plastic-adherent cells had to be
expanded in culture for long time to get the target cell number (1 × 108 cells/patient). The time
interval between the onset of stroke and MSC transplantation may be important in terms of
the efficacy of MSC transplantation for stroke. However, there has been no consensus for the
optimal time of MSC transplantation following a stroke. For this reason, this study evaluated
whether there were a significant time-dependent differences in the efficacy of MSC transplantation after an ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
MSC Preparation
MSCs were obtained from bone marrow of adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 20).
Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirates using Ficoll-Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were seeded at
a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; No. 11885,
GIBCO Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; No.
26140, GIBCO Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. The cells were
incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2 and the medium was changed
every 3 to 4 days until the adherent fibroblast-like cells reached confluence. Plastic-adherent
MSCs were collected and resuspended in fresh culture medium and transferred to new flasks
and then sub-cultured. These cells were uniformly positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90,
CD105 and CD166. In contrast, they were negative for the hematopoietic lineage markers
CD34, CD45, CD14 and HLA–DR as confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of expressed surface antigens. These MSCs differentiate into cells for osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic
lineages. The MSCs used in the present study were harvested at passage 5.

Animal Model Surgical Preparation
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Samsung Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI) (permit number: C-B1-113-2) and
performed in accordance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (ILAR) guide. All
animals were maintained in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC #001003). SD rats (8 weeks old,
270–300 g) were initially anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.0–2.0% isoflurane in 2:1 N2O:O2 using a face mask. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
was induced using an intraluminal vascular occlusion method [13]. To detect the occlusion or
reperfusion and the unintentional generation of subarachnoid hemorrhage during thread
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, a single laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF, Probe 418, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) probe was positioned over the ipsilateral cortex. One and a half
hours after MCAo, the animals were reanesthetized with isoflurane and reperfusion was performed by withdrawing the suture. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) dye test was performed to confirm the presence of infarction in randomly selected rats. Rats with 9–12 points
of the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) on both day 0 and day 1 of stroke were

used in this study. A sham-operated control group was treated in an identical fashion with the
omission of vascular occlusion. The mortality rate of rats was 30% during the operation.

MSC Transplantation
Approximately 3 × 106 MSCs in 600 μL total fluid volume were given via intravenous injection
using multi-syringe infusion/withdrawal pump (KDS 230, Seoul, Korea, 200 μL/min) to the
experimental groups at 1, 4, and 7 days after MCAo. Each of these three groups were referred
to as the D1, D4, and D7 groups (n = 7 per group). One mL PBS was given as an injection to
the PBS control group at 1 day after MCAo. The mortality rate of rats was 30% during the
transplantation. The study design is shown in Fig 1.

Neurological Function Tests
A battery of functional tests was performed prior to MCAo and at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days
after the MCAo procedure. The mNSS was used to assess the procedures, and neurological
function was graded on a scale of 0 to 14 (normal score 0, maximal deficit score 14). Originally,
NSS is determined as a composite of motor, sensory, reflexes, and balance tests [14]; however,
this study did not score the NSS reflex responses to exclude ambiguous determination. Rats
with 9–12 mNSS points on both day 0 and day 1 of stroke were used in this study.

Vital Fluorescent Imaging
Chloromethylbenzamido-1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate
(CM-DiI; No. C-7000, CellTracker, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. MSCs were stained for 5 minutes at 37°C in CM-DiI working
solution and then for an additional 15 minutes at 4°C. As a control, unstained MSCs went
through the same process without the use of the CM-DiI working solution. Both stained
and unstained MSCs were then resuspended in 600 μL PBS and 3 × 106 MSCs were intravenously transplanted at 1, 4, and 7 days after MCAo (n = 5 for each group). Unstained MSCs
were also transplanted at 1 day after MCAo (n = 2). Rats were sacrificed 3 days after MSC

transplantation and CM-DiI fluorescent signals were analyzed both on the whole brain surface
and with 2 mm thickness slices using a Xenogen IVIS system (Xenogen Corporation, Alameda,
CA). Rats were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After
decapitation, the brains were removed and kept in 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at
4°C, and then placed in 30% sucrose solution. The brains were cut into 20-micron cryostat sections. The tissues were mounted in Vectashield mounting media with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed using the Carl Zeiss LSM
700 confocal microscopy system (Jena, Germany), operated with appropriate wavelengths to
detect DAPI staining of nuclei and CM-DiI-labeled MSCs. Confocal images were analyzed
using LSM 700 Zen software.

In Vitro Migration Assay
Rats were sacrificed at 1, 4, and 7 days after MCAo (n = 5 at each time point) and the ischemic
cortical and striatal regions were immediately extracted. The brain segments were homogenized by adding DMEM (150 mg tissue/mL DMEM) and were incubated on ice for 10 minutes.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was
stored at −70°C until the beginning of the experiment. Brain extract was diluted to 20% in
serum-free DMEM immediately prior to use.
In vitro migration was evaluated using a 24-well plate and a transwell system (8 μm pore,
Corning Life Sciences) [15]. For migration assays, the lower side of the transwell filter was
coated with 50 μg/mL fibronectin (Sigma) for 1 hour at 37°C. After a 6-hour starvation in
serum-free DMEM, 5 × 104 MSCs resuspended in 100 μL serum-free DMEM were placed in
the upper chamber and 600 μL of serum-free DMEM with or without 20% brain extract were
placed in the lower chamber. After a 4-hour incubation period, the transwell filter was removed
and washed with PBS. After cleaning the upper face of the transwell filter with a cotton swab,
MSCs in the lower face of filter were stained with hematoxylin (MHS16; Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
and eosin (HST110216; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (H&E). The number of stained MSCs was
counted manually in 5 fields under a light microscope with 100-fold magnification.

ELISA
Quantitative immunoassays using ELISA (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) were performed to analyze the expression level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in brain extracts obtained from ischemic cortical and striatal
regions at 1, 4, and 7 days after MCAo (n = 4 for each group). The brain extracts from shamoperated rats were used as a control. The samples were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then the optical density (OD) was read on a spectrophotometer and the
experimental data that were obtained were compared with a standard MCP-1 and SDF-1 curve
using a SoftMax pro 4.8 program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Statistical Analysis
All data from functional tests, imaging, migration assays, and ELISA were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance
and unpaired Student’s t-test in SPSS version 16, if they have normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirov test, P > 0.05). Two-tailed probability values of < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Neurological Function Test
No difference was observed in the mNSS evaluation between groups at day 0 and day 1 of
MCAo. Prominent functional improvement was observed in the D1 group compared to the
control (PBS group), D4, or D7 groups at each time point 14 days after MCAo (Fig 2). The D4
and D7 groups also showed a functional improvement trend compared to the control group;
however, it was not statistically significant (n = 7 per group).

MSC Distribution According to Time of Transplantation
Vital fluorescent dye staining with CM-Dil did not affect the viability and morphology of the
MSCs (Fig 3A). The vital fluorescent imaging study indicated that the fluorescent signals on
the cortex were stronger in the D1 group than in the D4 or D7 groups. However, fluorescent
signals on the striatum were weaker in the D1 group than in the D4 or D7 groups (Fig 3B). The
quantification of MSCs by photon emission (photons/s/cm2/sr) also showed that the fluorescent intensity in the cortex was highest in the D1 group. In comparison, in the striatum, the
intensity was highest in the D4 group (Fig 3C). Similarly, the microscopic examination of
MSCs stained with CM-DiI indicated that the MSCs were predominantly observed at the cortex in the D1 group, but were predominantly observed at the striatum in the D4 and D7 groups
(Fig 3D). CM-DiI labelled MSCs maintained their regular cellular morphology (Fig 3D).

In Vitro Migration Assay
We hypothesized that MSCs preferentially migrate to the ischemic cortical region in the relatively early period after stroke, but then migrate to the ischemic striatal region in the relatively
late period after stroke, and that any time-dependent differences in chemotactic signals after
stroke might result in differential MSC migration. To better evaluate this hypothesis, an in
vitro migration assay was performed. The results indicated that transwell migration of MSCs
was more prominent with tissue extract from cortex obtained 1 day after MCAo than with
extracts that were obtained at 4 and 7 days after MCAo. However, in the striatum, MSC migration was more prominent in tissue extracts obtained at 4 or 7 days after MCAo than in extracts

obtained 1 day after MCAo (Fig 4). The migration assay results were consistent with the fluorescent imaging results which indicated that MSCs were primarily localized to the cortex in the
D1 group and to the striatum in the D4 and D7 groups.

MCP-1 and SDF-1 Concentrations in Ischemic Regions
The MCP-1 and SDF-1 concentrations were analyzed with an ELISA to investigate factors that
could affect the differential migration of MSCs to ischemic regions based on the time of transplantation. The results showed that the level of MCP-1 was higher in both the cortex and striatum 1 day after MCAo than at 4 or 7 days after the MCAo. In comparison, the level of SDF-1
was higher 4 or 7 days after MCAo than 1 day after MCAo in the striatum. However, no difference was observed in the level of SDF-1 in the cortex after the MCAo procedure (Fig 5).

achieving the best outcome after MSC therapy, there has been no consensus to date regarding

Optimal Timing of MSC Transplantation in Stroke

the optimal time to transplant MSCs after stroke. Some studies have indicated that an immediate MSC transplantation following a stroke improved cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier permeability, and significantly reduced infarction volume [9,16]. However, in other
studies, MSC administration 1 day, 7 days, or even at 1 month after stroke also had a positive
effect on functional recovery, but it did not significantly decrease the area of infarction
[7,10,17]. For this reason, the present study evaluated if there was a significant difference in the
efficacy of MSC treatment based on the amount of time that elapsed between stroke and MSC
transplantation. The results suggest that an earlier MSC transplantation may be associated
with better functional recovery after stroke and are consistent with results of the recent studies
addressing optimal timing for MSCs transplantation in stroke [18–20]. The efficacy of MSCs
transplanted during the early period following a stroke may be associated with the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs rather than with neurogenesis or brain remodeling. This is
because MSCs may decrease the inflammatory process induced by ischemia in the early period
of a stroke. In addition, growth and trophic factors released from MSCs may also reduce cellular apoptosis after stroke [2,21–23]. In addition, the present study found that the preferential
migration of MSCs to the ischemic cortical region, which modulates motor function. Our
results also suggest that the time-dependent differential expression of MCP-1 and SDF-1
between ischemic regions could mediate the differential migration of MSCs.
Brain ischemia initiates an inflammatory reaction that produces various chemokines such
as interleukin-8, MCP-1, SDF-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1. Specific chemokines, such as MCP-1 and SDF-1 have been suggested to act as key factors that stimulate MSC
migration towards the ischemic region [24–26]. Previous studies demonstrated that the level of
MCP-1 in the ischemic brain tissue extracts increased at 6 hours after MCAo, peaked at 48
hours, and decreased after 7 days. In addition, in regards to MSCs, the chemotactic activity of
MCP-1 peaked at 24 hours after MCAo. In contrast, SDF-1 expression was transiently downregulated at 6 hours, increased at 2 and 4 days, and then peaked within 7 days after ischemic
injury [24,27]. These findings are consistent with the research findings of this study. However,
in the recent study, the basic fibroblast growth factor and SDF-1 induced by cell transplantation play a role in MSC efficacy after stroke [20]. In the present study, MCP-1 and SDF-1 were
differentially expressed over time in ischemic brain cortex and striatum after MCAo. MCP-1
levels were highest at one day of ischemia and appeared to play a pivotal role in the promotion
of preferential MSC migration to the ischemic cortical region in the D1 group. In comparison,
the MSC migration to the ischemic striatal region in the D4 and D7 groups appeared to be
mainly supported by SDF-1. Although MCP-1 and SDF-1 levels were only measured in the
present study, the data suggest that differential MSC migration after stroke could be mediated
by the time-dependent differential expression of chemokines, including MCP-1 and SDF-1
after stroke. Specifically, the more prominent MSC migration to the cortex and better functional improvement seen in earlier MSC transplantation could be related to the increased
expression of MCP-1 in the early phase after an ischemic stroke. Additional studies are needed
to elucidate the time-dependent differential migration mechanism of MSCs.
Results of this study are in agreement with a few recent reports that investigated the optimal
timing for MSC transplantation in consideration of the fact that an earlier transplantation
could be associated with better outcomes than a later transplantation [19,28,29]. However, a
few clinical studies which investigated the feasibility and efficacy of MSCs for stroke patients,
used BM-derived, ex vivo expanded autologous MSCs for transplantation. It was not possible
to transplant autologous MSCs within an optimal time window after the onset of stroke, since
it required a minimum of several weeks to expand the MSCs beyond the target cell number
[12,30]. Therefore, our results suggest that a clinical strategy using the allogeneic MSCs might
be more optimal than the strategy using autologous MSCs for the stroke treatment. In general,

Optimal Timing of MSC Transplantation in Stroke

MSCs are considered to have relatively low immunogenicity, in spite of constitutive HLA-class
I expression and IFN-γ inducible HLA-class II expression [31]. Preclinical models and clinical
trials using allogeneic MSCs have demonstrated that no adverse events were associated with
allogeneic MSC transplantation [32,33]. Furthermore, several clinical studies that used thirdparty MSCs suggested that third-party MSC infusion is also feasible [32,34]. Altogether, these
findings suggest that an early transplantation with allogeneic MSCs following a stroke could
prove to be a better option for stroke treatment than delayed transplantation with autologous
MSCs. In addition, another alternative option for early MSC transplantation would be to use
autologous MSCs which were pre-cryopreserved after ex vivo expansion before the onset of
stroke in patients who exhibited high-risk factors for stroke.
In conclusion, our results suggest that an earlier MSC transplantation could be associated
with a better functional recovery after stroke, which can be explained by the preferential migration of MSCs to the ischemic cortical region which was observed in the group that received
early transplantation. The time-dependent differential expression of MCP-1 and SDF-1
between ischemic regions (cortex vs. striatum) after stroke seemed to mediate the differential
migration of the MSCs. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the optimal timing of transplantation and the optimal source of MSCs to achieve the best outcomes.
