Introduction
Summary. Background: Platelet activation and aggregation
are crucial for primary hemostasis, but can also result in
occlusive thrombus formation. Agonist-induced platelet activation involves diﬀerent signaling pathways leading to the
activation of phospholipases, which produce second messengers. The role of phospholipase C (PLC) in platelet activation is
well established, but less is known about the relevance of
phospholipase D (PLD) . Objective and methods: The aim of
this study was to determine a potential function of PLD2 in
platelet physiology. Thus, we investigated the function of PLD2
in platelet signaling and thrombus formation, by generating
mice lacking PLD2 or both PLD1 and PLD2. Adhesion,
activation and aggregation of PLD-deﬁcient platelets were
analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Results: Whereas the absence of
PLD2 resulted in reduced PLD activity in platelets, it had no
detectable eﬀect on the function of the cells in vitro and in vivo.
However, the combined deﬁciency of both PLD isoforms
resulted in defective a-granule release and protection in a
model of FeCl3-induced arteriolar thrombosis, eﬀects that were
not observed in mice lacking only one PLD isoform. Conclusion: These results reveal redundant roles of
PLD1 and PLD2 in platelet a-granule secretion, and indicate
that this may be relevant for pathologic thrombus formation.
Keywords: degranulation, phospholipase D, platelet, signaling,
thrombosis.

Blood platelets ÔmonitorÕ the integrity of the vascular system,
and, in response to altered vascular surfaces, e.g. at sites of
traumatic injury or pathologic alteration of the endothelial
layer, they rapidly become activated. This activation causes a
morphologic change of the cells from a discoid to a spherical
shape, their ﬁrm adhesion and spreading on the reactive
surface, the exocytosis of a-granules and dense granules, and
platelet–platelet interactions. This multistep process, which
involves multiple membrane receptors and intracellular signaling pathways [1], is crucial to form a platelet plug that seals the
wound site and thereby limits blood loss after tissue trauma.
However, in diseased arteries, these events may lead to
thrombotic vessel occlusion and ischemic tissue damage [2],
such as in myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke [3,4].
At sites of injury, exposure of subendothelial collagens
triggers platelet activation via tyrosine phosphorylation cascades downstream of glycoprotein (GP) VI, with its associated
immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) [5]. Activated platelets release the soluble agonists thromboxane A2
(TxA2) and ADP, which – together with locally generated
thrombin – stimulate receptors that couple to heterotrimeric Gprotein-coupled receptors and induce distinct downstream
signaling pathways [6]. Stimulation of Gq or ITAM-coupled
receptors induces the activation of phospholipase C (PLC)
family proteins, which trigger calcium mobilization and the
activation of protein kinase C (PKC) via diacylglycerol
(DAG). All of these signaling events converge in the Ôﬁnal
common pathwayÕ of platelet activation, the functional upregulation of integrin adhesion receptors, most notably aIIbb3
integrin. This so-called Ôinside-outÕ activation enables integrins
to efﬁciently bind their ligands [7], thus promoting ﬁrm
adhesion and platelet aggregation by binding to ligands such
as von Willebrand factor (VWF), ﬁbronectin, or ﬁbrinogen.
Furthermore, platelets secrete their granule contents upon
activation, and thereby reinforce the local thrombotic activity.
Dense granules contain predominantly small molecules, such as
ADP and serotonin, whereas a-granules contain a vast array of

2362 I. Thielmann et al

proteins, ranging from adhesion molecules and coagulation
factors to chemokines and cytokines [8].
Phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms also become activated
downstream of major platelet signaling pathways. PLD is a
widely distributed enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine
to choline and phosphatidic acid (PA) [9]. PA, as well as its
metabolites DAG and lysoPA, are important intracellular
messengers that have critical roles in several cellular functions
[9]. In the presence of a primary alcohol, the alcohol, and not
water, is the preferred substrate, leading to the generation of
phosphatidyl alcohol instead of PA. This transphosphatidylation is unique to PLD, and is commonly used in assays to
measure the activity of the enzyme [10]. Two mammalian PLD
isoforms exist, and are ubiquitously expressed: PLD1 [11] and
PLD2, which share  50% sequence homology [12]. PLD1 is
believed to be activated by PKC and GTPases of the ADP
ribosylation factor and Rho families [13–15]. The regulation of
PLD2 is still a matter of debate. Because of the high basal
activity of PLD2 in vitro [16], it has been speculated that its
activity is not inducible, but others have shown that it increases
upon stimulation [17,18]. In platelets, both PLD isoforms are
present, and PLD activity has been reported to be upregulated
upon platelet activation by collagen, thrombin, and the TxA2
analog U46619 [19,20]. It has been suggested that PLD is
required for the secretion of dense granules [21] and lysosomes
[20]. However, until recently [22–24], no PLD-deﬁcient mice
were reported, and potential downstream targets of PLD were
identiﬁed mostly by correlation studies (linking PLD activity to
simultaneously occurring cellular events) or by inhibiting PA
generation with 1-butanol to divert PLD activity. Yet, primary
alcohols only partially prevent PA production, even at the
maximal applicable concentrations, and have off-target effects
on cell behavior that may confound interpretation of the
obtained results [25]. We recently reported the analysis of
Pld1)/) platelets, and revealed that PLD1 is required for proper
integrin activation in response to weak agonist signals.
Consequently, mice lacking PLD1 were protected against
arterial thrombosis and ischemic stroke [23]. A very recent
study, which used a PLD inhibitor, suggested a role of PLD2 as
negative regulator of platelet secretion [26]. However, by using
Pld2)/) and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice, we show that the isolated
loss of PLD2 has no effect on platelet activation, whereas the
combined deﬁciency of both PLD isoforms results in a defect in
a-granule release and protection from ferric chloride-induced
thrombosis.

Male chimeric mice originating from the injection of ES cells
into albino C57Bl/6 blastocyts were bred to C57Bl/6 females to
generate Pld2)/) mice, which were intercrossed to produce
Pld2)/) mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR, with 5¢AAGCAACACCACACATTCCA-3¢ and 5¢-CTTCCCGACT
CACAGCTTTC-3¢ for the wild type, and 5¢-TCATTCTCAGTATTGTTTTGCC-3¢ and 5¢-GGAGGAAGAGTGAGATGAAG-3¢ for the Pld2-null allele. Pld2)/) mice were
intercrossed with Pld1)/) mice [23], which had meanwhile been
backcrossed with a C57Bl/6 background, to generate Pld1)/)/
Pld2)/) mice.
Chemicals and antibodies

The anesthetic drugs used included medetomidine (Pﬁzer,
Karlsruhe, Germany), midazolam (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen,
Germany), and fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany). To
reverse anesthesia, atipamezol (Pﬁzer) and ﬂumazenil and
naloxon (both from Delta Select, Dreieich, Germany) were
used according to local authority regulations. ADP was from
Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany), protease-activated
receptor 4 (PAR4)-activating peptide was from Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc (Dreieich, Germany), U46619 was from Alexis
Biochemicals (San Diego, CA, USA), thrombin was from
Roche, collagen (Kollagenreagent Horm) was from Nycomed
(Munich, Germany), apyrase type III was from GE Healthcare
(Chalfont St. Giles, UK), human ﬁbrinogen, high molecular
weight heparin and rabbit anti-PLD2 (P5993) were from
Sigma-Aldrich, rabbit anti-tubulin (MAB1864) was from
Chemicon (Hofheim, Germany), and anti-rabbit IgG–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was from Dako Cytomation (Hamburg, Germany). Indomethacin was purchased from a local
pharmacy. All monoclonal anti-platelet GP antibodies conjugated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin or
DyLight 488 were obtained from Emfret Analytics (Eibelstadt,
Germany). Collagen-related peptide (CRP) was generated as
previously described [27].
RT-PCR analysis

Murine platelet mRNA was isolated with Trizol reagent and
detected by RT-PCR, according to the manufacturerÕs protocol
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The following primers were
used to detect the Pld2 transcript: 5¢-GTGCCACTGTGCAG
GTCTTGAGG-3¢ and 5¢-GCAGAATAGCCTGGATG
GAG-3¢.

Materials and methods
Immunoblotting
Animals

Animal studies were approved by the district government of
Lower Franconia (Bezirksregierung Unterfranken). Pld2)/)
mice were generated as follows. A VGB6 embryonic stem (ES)
cell clone (BD1) in which the Pld2 gene was deleted and
replaced with a lacZ-ﬂanked and loxP-ﬂanked neocassette was
obtained from KOMP Repository (http://www.komp.org).

Proteins of lysed platelets were separated by SDS-PAGE and
blotted onto poly(vinylidene diﬂuoride) membranes. After
blocking, the membrane was incubated with antibody overnight at 4 C. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were

PLD1 and PLD2 function in platelets 2363
Platelet preparation and PLD activity measurements

Washed platelets were prepared as previously described [28].
To determine PLD activity, the formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]Ptd-EtOH) was measured with standard
protocols [10,20]. Washed platelets were adjusted to a ﬁnal
concentration of · 108 platelets mL)1, and were labeled with
3.7 kBp mL)1 [3H]palmitic acid (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau,
Germany) at 37 C for 1 h. Aliquots of 80 lL were preincubated with 0.5% ethanol for 10 min, and then stimulated with
thrombin (0.1 U mL)1) or CRP (10 lg mL)1) in the presence
of 2 mM CaCl2. Reactions were stopped by adding 500 lL of
ice-cold chloroform/methanol and placing on ice. To extract
the lipids, 500 lL of ice-cold chloroform and 350 lL of water
were added; the lipids were then collected in the organic phase,
and separated by TLC. [3H]Ptd-EtOH bands were identiﬁed
through comigration with standards, and quantiﬁed by scintillation. PLD activity is depicted as percentage of phosphatidylethanol of total H3-labeled phospholipids.
Platelet aggregation/ATP release and flow cytometry

Washed platelets (160 lL with 1.56 · 108 platelets mL)1) were
analyzed in the presence of 70 lg mL)1 human ﬁbrinogen.
Transmission was recorded on a four-channel aggregometer
(Fibrintimer; APACT, Hamburg, Germany) for 10 min, and
was expressed in arbitrary units, with buffer representing 100%
transmission. ATP secretion was measured with CHRONOLUME reagent, according to the manufacturerÕs protocol, on a
Chronolog aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown,
PA, USA). Luciferase (25 lL) was added directly to the
platelets (0.5 · 106 platelets lL)1) under constant stirring, and
the indicated concentrations of various agonists were added to
study ATP release. The luminescence intensity was measured at
a setting of · 0.01. For ﬂow cytometry, heparinized whole
blood was diluted 1 : 20, incubated with the appropriate
ﬂuorophore-conjugated mAbs for 15 min at room temperature, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson,
Heidelberg, Germany).
Measurement of VWF and platelet factor 4 (PF4) release

Washed platelets were adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of
0.5 · 106 platelets lL)1, and activated in the presence of
1.4 lM indomethacin and 2 U mL)1 apyrase with the indicated
agonists for 15 min at 37 C. Platelets were immediately
centrifuged. VWF in the supernatant was quantiﬁed by ELISA,
with unconjugated and HRP-conjugated anti-human VWF
(hVWF) antibodies (DakoCytomation). The amount of
secreted PF4 was quantiﬁed with a PF4 ELISA (RayBiotech,
Norcross, GA, USA).
Adhesion under flow conditions

Rectangular coverslips (24 · 60 mm) were coated with
0.2 mg mL)1 ﬁbrillar type I collagen (Nycomed) or rabbit
 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis

anti-hVWF antibody (1 : 500; AOO82; DakoCytomation) for
1 h at 37 C, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. For
ﬂow adhesion experiments on VWF, blocked coverslips were
incubated with murine plasma for 2 h at 37 C to allow binding
of VWF to immobilized anti-VWF antibody. Heparinized whole
blood was labeled with a DyLight 488-conjugated anti-GPIX Ig
derivative at 0.2 lg mL)1, and perfusion was performed as
previously described [29]. Image analysis was performed off-line
with METAVUE software (Visitron, Munich, Germany). Thrombus formation was expressed as the mean percentage of total area
covered by thrombi, and as the mean integrated ﬂuorescence
intensity per square millimeter. Platelet adhesion on the VWF
matrix was analyzed by counting adhesive platelets per visual
ﬁeld.
Intravital microscopy of thrombus formation in FeCl3-injured
mesenteric arterioles

Four-week-old mice were anesthetized, and the mesentery was
exteriorized through a midline abdominal incision [30]. Arterioles (35–60 lm diameter) were visualized with a Zeiss
Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (· 10/0.3 NA objective)
(Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a 100-W
HBO ﬂuorescent lamp source, and a CoolSNAP-EZ camera
(Visitron). Digital images were recorded and analyzed off-line
with METAVUE software. Injury was induced by topical
application of a 3-mm2 ﬁlter paper saturated with FeCl3
(20%) for 10 s. Adhesion and aggregation of ﬂuorescently
labeled platelets (Dylight-488-conjugated anti-GPIX Ig derivative) in arterioles were monitored for 40 min or until complete
occlusion occurred (blood ﬂow stopped for > 1 min).
Aorta occlusion model

A longitudinal incision was used to open the abdominal cavity
and expose the abdominal aorta of anesthetized mice. An
ultrasonic ﬂow probe was placed around the vessel, and
thrombosis was induced by a single ﬁrm compression with
forceps. Blood ﬂow was monitored for 30 min.
Transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (tMCAO)
model

Experiments were conducted on 8–10-week-old mice according
to previously published recommendations for research in
mechanism-driven basic stroke studies [31]. tMCAO was
induced under inhalation anesthesia with the intraluminal
ﬁlament (Doccol Company, Sharon, VT, USA) technique [32].
After 60 min, the ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion.
For measurements of ischemic brain volume, mice were killed
24 h after induction of tMCAO, and brain sections were
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (SigmaAldrich). Brain infarct volumes were calculated and corrected
for edema [32]. Neurologic function and motor function were
assessed by two independent and blinded investigators 24 h
after tMCAO, as previously described [32].

Statistics

Results from at least three experiments per group are
presented as means ± standard deviations. Differences
between two groups were assessed with the Mann–Whitney
U-test. For the stroke model, infarct volumes and functional
data were tested for Gaussian distribution with the DÕAgostino and Pearson omnibus normality test, and then
analyzed with the two-tailed StudentÕs t-test. For statistical
analysis, PRISMGRAPH 4.0 software (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA, USA) was used. Differences between more
than two groups were analyzed with one-way ANOVA with
DunnettÕs T3 as post hoc test, with SPSS 20. A P-value of
< 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Generation of Pld2)/) mice

To directly test the function of PLD2 in platelet activation and
thrombus formation, we disrupted the Pld2 gene in mice. In
line with a previous report [24], mice heterozygous for Pld2-null
mutation and Pld2)/) mice were born in the expected
Mendelian ratio, developed normally, and were viable and
fertile. The mice appeared to be healthy, and did not show any
signs of spontaneous bleeding. RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and western
blot analysis (Fig. 1B) conﬁrmed the absence of PLD2 in
platelets and other tissues. Pld1 mRNA expression was
unaltered in Pld2)/) platelets, indicating that Pld1 mRNA
expression is not upregulated upon Pld2 gene deletion. Blood
cell counts, mean platelet volume, platelet lifespan and the
expression of prominent surface GP receptors were similar
between wild-type and Pld2)/) mice (Table S1 and data not
shown). Together, these results indicate that megakaryopoiesis
and platelet formation occur independently of PLD2.
To assess the effect of PLD2 deﬁciency on platelet PLD
activity, a widely accepted in vivo PLD assay was used that
detects phosphatidylethanol, a non-degradable product of
PLD. Only low basal PLD activity was detected in wild-type
platelets ( 5% of maximal activity, Fig. 1C), but platelet
activation with classic agonists, such as thrombin or CRP,
resulted in a pronounced increase in PLD activity. Remarkably, PLD activity detected at early time points was reduced in
Pld2)/) platelets (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that PLD activity in
platelets is tightly regulated and that PLD2 signiﬁcantly
contributes to the total PLD activity in these cells. However,
the high residual inducible PLD activity in Pld2)/) platelets,

platelets at late time points, conﬁrmed the previous notion that
PLD1 is the dominant isoform in these cells [23].
Absence of PLD2 has no effect on platelet activation in vitro

We investigated whether reduced PLD activity in Pld2)/)
platelets inﬂuences agonist-induced platelet activation. Flow
cytometric analysis of aIIbb3 activation and degranulation,
determined as the surface expression of P-selectin (Fig. 2A)
and ATP release (not shown), yielded indistinguishable
results for Pld2)/) and wild-type platelets in response to all
tested agonists at all concentrations. Similarly, no differences in reactivity were noted between Pld2)/) and wild-type
platelets in standard aggregometry with different agonists
(Fig. 2B). Our recent study of Pld1)/) platelets [23] revealed
a signaling role for PLD1 downstream of GPIb, which is
difﬁcult to assess under static conditions. Consequently, ﬂow
adhesion assays were performed in which whole blood was
perfused over a collagen-coated or VWF-coated surface at

Pld2)/) platelets spread to a similar extent and with the same

kinetics as wild-type platelets (Fig. S1). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that the absence of PLD2 has no effect on platelet
activation in vitro.

Normal hemostasis and occlusive thrombus formation in
Pld2)/) mice

Next, we analysed the effect of PLD2 deﬁciency on platelet
function in hemostasis and thrombosis. Bleeding times after
amputation of the tail tip of wild-type and Pld2)/) mice were
similar (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the application of 20% FeCl3 on
the exteriorized mesenteric arterioles of Pld2)/) mice resulted in
fast platelet adhesion and thrombus growth leading to
irreversible vessel occlusion after 14.2 ± 4.1 min, which was
similar to the kinetics of thrombus formation observed in wildtype mice (13.8 ± 3.4 min; Fig. 3B,C). As Pld1)/) mice have
been shown to be protected in another in vivo model, in which

monitored with an ultrasonic perivascular Doppler ﬂowmeter
[23], Pld2)/) mice were also subjected to this model. However,
also in this system, no difference between wild-type and Pld2)/)
mice was observed (Fig. 3D).
To test for a potential role of PLD2 in focal cerebral
ischemia, the development of neuronal damage in Pld2)/) mice
following tMCAO was studied. For this, a thread was
advanced through the carotid artery into the MCA, reducing
regional cerebral ﬂow by > 90% to induce cerebral ischemia,
and was removed after 1 h to allow reperfusion [32,34]. At 24 h
after reperfusion, both infarct volumes (Fig. 3E) and neurologic scores (not shown) were indistinguishable between wildtype and Pld2)/) mice.
Together, these results demonstrate that thrombus formation, hemostasis and ischemic brain infarct development occur
independently of PLD2.
Partially redundant function of PLD1 and PLD2 in platelet
degranulation

PLD1 and PLD2 share a high degree of sequence homology,
making it likely that one isoform is able to compensate, at least
partially, for the loss of the other. In order to address this
question, Pld2)/) mice were intercrossed with Pld1)/) mice [23]
to obtain mice lacking both PLD isoforms. The combined
deﬁciency of PLD1 and PLD2 completely abolished agonistinduced PLD activity in platelets (Fig. 4A). Nevertheless,
Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice developed normally, were viable, were
fertile, and appeared to be healthy. Blood cell counts, mean
platelet volume and the expression of prominent surface GP
receptors were similar between wild-type and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/)
mice, apart from slightly elevated white blood cell counts and
increased b1 integrin levels on the platelet surface (Table S2).
Together, these results indicate that PLD activity is dispensable
for megakaryopoiesis and platelet production.
Next, we tested whether the absence of PLD activity
inﬂuences agonist-induced platelet activation. As the lack of
PLD1 alone results in mild defects in platelet integrin activation
[23], ﬂow cytometric analyses were performed with wild-type,
Pld1)/) and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) platelets, to enable direct comparison of single-deﬁcient and double-deﬁcient cells. Degranulation
was indistinguishable between wild-type and Pld1)/) platelets,
 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis

but Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) platelets showed reduced a-granule release
upon stimulation of PAR4 with either thrombin or PAR4activating peptide, as determined by the levels of surfaceexposed P-selectin (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the secretion of the
a-granular proteins VWF and PF4 was decreased in Pld1)/)/
Pld2)/) platelets as compared with wild-type platelets
(Fig. 4C,E), whereas platelets lacking only one PLD isoform
did not show a defect in secretion of VWF (Fig. S2). In order to
exclude the possibility that this defect results from defective agranule biogenesis in Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) platelets, we performed
transmission electron microscopy. Microscopic analyses showed
that the amount and localization of a-granules in Pld1)/)/Pld2)/)
platelets were similar to those in wild-type platelets (Fig. S3). To
test whether the secretion defect was speciﬁc for a-granules, we
assessed ATP release as a measure of dense granule secretion.
Remarkably, agonist-induced ATP release was indistinguishable between wild-type and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) platelets (Fig. 4F).
No ATP secretion was detectable in platelets of either genotype
at lower thrombin concentrations (not shown). This indicated
that PLD1 and PLD2 have redundant functions in the secretion
of a-granules upon weak stimulation of platelet PAR4. In
Pld1)/) platelets, integrin activation was slightly reduced upon
stimulation with low and intermediate concentrations of
thrombin or PAR4-activating peptide, conﬁrming previous
results [23]. This defect was even more pronounced in platelets
lacking both PLD isoforms (Fig. 4D).
Despite these defects in integrin activation and degranulation, no differences in reactivity were noted between Pld1)/)/
Pld2)/) and wild-type platelets in aggregometry (Fig. 4G). This
supports previous reports stating that robust aggregation can
occur in this assay under conditions of suboptimal integrin
activation [35,36].
Absence of both PLD isoforms protects mice from FeCl3induced arteriolar thrombosis

In vivo, platelet activation and thrombus formation occur in
ﬂowing blood, where locally produced soluble mediators are
rapidly diluted. Under these conditions, subtle defects in
integrin activation may translate into reduced thrombus
formation. Thus, we investigated the effect of PLD double
deﬁciency in a model of arteriolar thrombosis. We have
previously shown that Pld1)/) mice are protected in arterial
thrombosis models induced by chemical injury of the carotid
artery or mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta [23].
Therefore, we chose the FeCl3-induced mesenteric arteriole
injury model to investigate a potential redundant function of
the two PLD isoforms. The application of 20% FeCl3 on the
exteriorized mesenteric arterioles of Pld1)/) mice resulted in
fast platelet adhesion and thrombus growth leading to
irreversible vessel occlusion after 19.4 ± 4.1 min, which was
similar to the kinetics of thrombus formation observed in wildtype mice (20.8 ± 3.6 min; Fig. 5A,B). In contrast, although
initial platelet adhesion in Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice was similar to
that in wild-type or Pld1)/) mice, the ﬁnal outcome was more
variable. In 12 of 34 Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) vessels, no full occlusion

four of 38 wild-type vessels remained open. In the cases in
which full occlusion of the vessels was observed, time to full
occlusion was signiﬁcantly prolonged in Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice

functions that are relevant for thrombus formation in vivo.

in Pld1)/) mice [23], suggesting that PLD2 made only a very
minor contribution to infarct growth in this model.
To test whether the reduced thrombus stability in Pld1)/)/
Pld2)/) mice impaired hemostasis, tail bleeding experiments
were performed. No signiﬁcant differences in bleeding times
were found between wild-type and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice
(Fig. 6D), demonstrating that PLD activity is dispensable for
normal hemostasis.

Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice are protected from ischemic stroke
while having unaltered hemostasis

Discussion

Next, we analyzed the effect of the combined deﬁciency of both
PLD isoforms on the outcome after cerebral ischemia.
Wild-type and Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice were subjected to the
tMCAO model. In Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice, infarct volumes 24 h
after reperfusion were reduced to  60% as compared with the
infarct volumes of wild-type mice (87.0 ± 24.8 mm3 vs.
51.5 ± 31.0 mm3; Fig. 6A). Reduction of infarct size was
functionally relevant, as the Bederson score, which assesses
global neurologic function, was signiﬁcantly better in Pld1)/)/
Pld2)/) mice (2.9 ± 0.6 vs. 1.9 ± 0.9; Fig. 6B). The grip test,
which speciﬁcally measures motor function and coordination,
showed a similar tendency, although the difference was not
signiﬁcant (3.9 ± 1.6 vs. 4.6 ± 0.5, data not shown). The
protection of Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) mice was similar to that observed

Our results show, for the ﬁrst time, that PLD2 is dispensable
for platelet production and function. However, combined
deﬁciency of PLD1 and PLD2 resulted in a selective defect in agranule secretion in response to submaximal thrombin stimulation and protection in a model of arterial thrombosis, making
PLDs attractive targets for safe antithrombotic treatments.
PLD has been implicated in many elementary cell functions,
leading to the assumption that the enzyme might be required
for development [9]. In line with this assumption, the ﬁrst
reports on Pld knockout mice led to the hypothesis that the
absence of one PLD isoform can be compensated for by the
other [23,37]. However, the present study, which is the ﬁrst
report on mice lacking both PLD isoforms, shows that these
animals do not display obvious defects, indicating that PLD is

not required for normal development. Most previous studies
on the potential role of PLD were performed with inhibitors,
mostly primary alcohols, which might have off-target effects
and thereby lead to an overestimation of the signiﬁcance of
PLD. Thus, previous results obtained with inhibitors should be
carefully re-evaluated, making use of knockout mice.
Previously, high constitutive PLD activity has been reported
in platelets [20] and attributed to PLD2, owing to its high basal
activity in vitro [16]. In contrast to this, an older study showed
negligible basal PLD activity [19], which we also observed
(Fig. 1A). This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that
the authors of the former study used [3H]arachidonic acid to
measure PLD activity, which might have caused platelet
activation via the thromboxane receptor triggering PLD
activity [19]. In our analyses, PLD activity upon platelet
stimulation in Pld2)/) platelets was decreased as compared
with PLD activity in wild-type platelets, demonstrating that
both PLD isoforms are inducible upon platelet stimulation but
that, in line with previous reports [20,23], PLD1 appears to be
the major PLD isoform in platelets.

Our results show that the decreased PLD activity resulting
from the absence of PLD2 alone does not alter platelet
function, at least under the experimental conditions used in this
study. Thus, we generated mice lacking both PLD isoforms to
determine potential redundant functions of the two enzymes.
In our initial report on Pld1)/) mice [23], we observed a slight
defect in integrin activation upon submaximal platelet activation with thrombin/PAR4-activating peptide or CRP. In the
present study, we did not detect reduced CRP responses in
Pld1)/) mice (Fig. 4B,D), whereas the defect downstream of
thrombin or GPIb (as assessed by ﬂow adhesion experiments
with a VWF-coated surface) persisted (Fig. 4B,D and data not
shown). It is of note that, in contrast to our initial report, for
which we used mice on an Sv129 · C57Bl/6 mixed background, for this study we used mice on a pure C57Bl/6
background. The different genetic background of the mice
might affect GPVI responses to CRP, e.g. by slight alterations
of GPVI surface expression levels. Previously, it has been
demonstrated that, especially, CRP responses depend to a great
extent on GPVI expression levels [38], providing a possible
explanation for this discrepancy between this study and our
previous report [23]. Alternatively, GPVI signaling could be
inﬂuenced by modiﬁer genes that differ between the two mouse
strains. Such a strong impact of modiﬁers was reported to be
the reason for variable in vivo results with Gp6)/) mice [39].
The direct comparison of Pld1)/) with Pld1)/)/Pld2)/)
platelets (Fig. 4) revealed a strong defect in integrin activation
and a-granule release downstream of submaximal stimulation
with thrombin, which was not observed in either singleknockout platelet population. Our observation of reduced
secretion in PLD-deﬁcient platelets contradicts a recently
proposed model suggesting that PLD2 is a negative regulator
of platelet degranulation [26]. However, the authors of that
study used an inhibitor (5-ﬂuoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide [FIPI]) that not only blocks both PLD isoforms but might
also have off-target effects. This is especially problematic in
that particular case, as the FIPI concentration was titrated until
effects on platelet degranulation (not on PLD activity) could be
observed. Consequently, the inhibitor concentration used by
Elvers et al. was 100-fold higher than that necessary to
abrogate PLD activity [25], suggesting that this may not have
been the optimal approach to study PLD function. The agranule release defect in platelets lacking both PLD isoforms
might at least partially explain the more pronounced defect in
integrin activation, as reduced a-granule secretion results in
reduced mobilization of intracellularly stored aIIbb3 to the
platelet surface.
A role for PLD in secretion and secretory vesicle formation
has been described for several cell types [9], including platelets
[19,20]. However, degranulation of a-granules or dense granules was not affected in platelets lacking only one PLD isoform,
whereas the combined deﬁciency resulted in defective a-granule
secretion downstream of submaximal thrombin stimulation.
PKC is essential for granule secretion [40], and PLD and PKC
regulate each other via a positive feedback loop [41]. However,
it is difﬁcult to explain why an effect of PLD on PKC would
 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis

PLD1 and PLD2 function in platelets 2371

affect secretion from a-granules but not from dense granules.
Nevertheless, the absence of dense granules but not of agranules in platelets lacking PKCa [42] demonstrates that one
PKC isoform does have differential effects on the release of the
major granule subtypes. Thus, one could speculate that the
selective a-granule defect observed in platelets lacking PLD
results from differential regulation of PKC isoforms. Another
explanation might be that PLD, or its product PA, regulates agranule cargo proteins and thereby the ﬁnal steps of vesicle
membrane fusion. It has been demonstrated that the Nethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein
receptors (SNAREs) syntaxin 4 and VAMP-8 are crucial for
a-granule secretion [8,43]. In vitro studies with syntaxin 4
vesicles have demonstrated that addition of PA enhances the
rate of fusion [44]. Via this mechanism, PLD might promote
the degranulation of platelet a-granules. Stimulation with other
agonists or higher thrombin doses results in degranulation of
Pld1)/)/Pld2)/) platelets similar to that observed in wild-type
platelets (Fig. 4), demonstrating that PLD is not strictly
required for platelet secretion. Further studies will be required
to reveal the exact mechanism whereby PLD contributes to
platelet degranulation.
In conclusion, we have shown that PLD1 and PLD2 have
redundant functions in platelet a-granule secretion downstream
of protease-activated receptors. Considering that current PLD
inhibitors are isoform-selective at best, but deﬁnitively not
speciﬁc, the observation that mice lacking both PLD isoforms
display no obvious hemostatic defect is of signiﬁcant interest.
Thus, interfering with PLD activity and thereby dampening
GPIb-triggered integrin activation [23] and platelet degranulation might be a promising and safe strategy for antithrombotic
therapy.
