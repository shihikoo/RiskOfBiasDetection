Abstract
Background: our objective was to examine the plasma levels of three biological markers involved in cerebral
ischemia (IL-6, glutamate and TNF-alpha) in stroke patients and compare them with two different rat models of
focal ischemia (embolic stroke model- ES and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion ligation model-pMCAO)
to evaluate which model is most similar to humans. Secondary objectives: 1) to analyze the relationship of these
biological markers with the severity, volume and outcome of the brain infarction in humans and the two stroke
models; and 2) to study whether the three biomarkers are also increased in response to damage in organs other
than the central nervous system, both in humans and in rats.
Methods: Multi-center, prospective, case-control study including acute stroke patients (n = 58) and controls (n = 19) with
acute non-neurological diseases Main variables: plasma biomarker levels on admission and at 72 h; stroke severity (NIHSS
scale) and clinical severity (APACHE II scale); stroke volume; functional status at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]
and Barthel index [BI]). Experimental groups: ES (n = 10), pMCAO (n = 6) and controls (tissue stress by leg compression)
(n = 6). Main variables: plasma biomarker levels at 3 and 72 h; volume of ischemic lesion (H&E) and cell death (TUNEL).
Results: in stroke patients, IL-6 correlated significantly with clinical severity (APACHE II scale), stroke severity (NIHSS scale),
infarct volume (cm3) and clinical outcome (mRS) (r = 0.326, 0.497, 0.290 and 0.444 respectively; P < 0.05).
Glutamate correlated with stroke severity, but not with outcome, and TNF-alpha levels with infarct volume. In
animals, The ES model showed larger infarct volumes (median 58.6% vs. 29%, P < 0.001) and higher inflammatory
biomarkers levels than pMCAO, except for serum glutamate levels which were higher in pMCAO. The ES showed
correlations between the biomarkers and cell death (r = 0.928 for IL-6; P < 0.001; r = 0.765 for TNF-alpha, P < 0.1;
r = 0.783 for Glutamate, P < 0.1) and infarct volume (r = 0.943 for IL-6, P < 0.0001) more similar to humans than pMCAO.
IL-6, glutamate and TNF-α levels were not higher in cerebral ischemia than in controls.
Conclusions: Both models, ES and pMCAO, show differences that should be considered when conducting
translational studies. IL-6, Glutamate and TNF-α are not specific for cerebral ischemia either in humans or in rats.

Introduction
Experimental focal cerebral ischemia models have
been developed in rats to mimic human stroke and
serve as an indispensable tool in the stroke research
field [1,2]. However, although rats are ideal animals
for mimicking human stroke due to the close similarities of their cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology with humans [3-5], numerous drugs have
demonstrated efficacy in preclinical assessments but
not in clinical trials in humans [2]. This failure of
translation could be explained, at least in part, by
differences in the ischemic response between animals
and humans.
Ischemic injury trigger inflammatory cascades and
changes in the neurotransmitters in the brain parenchyma
that may further amplify the tissue damage. Interleukin-6
(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are
some of the most studied cytokines in stroke-related
inflammation [6-10]. In stroke patients, IL-6 has
been linked to early neurological deterioration (END)
[6], greater infarct volumes [7] and poorer long-term
outcome [8]. High levels of TNF-α in plasma also
correlate also with infarct volume and neurological
function in models of cerebral ischemia [9-11]. Moreover, glutamate (Glu) is an excitotoxic amino acid
(EAA) that has been associated with post-ischemia
brain damage in animals as well as with progression
of ischemic stroke, END and infarct growth in
humans [12-14].
Two widely used animal models to human brain
ischemia are the embolic stroke (ES) and the permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAO)
models in rats [3,15-17]. However, there are no comparative analyses of the inflammatory and excitotoxic
response after brain ischemia between focal ischemia
rat models and stroke patients in clinical practice. Increasing the knowledge about the differences and
similarities between experimental stroke models and
stroke in humans could allows for choosing the
model that better resembles human for the translational
research.
Our primary objective was to study the plasma level
profile of TNF-α, IL-6 and Glu in patients with acute
cerebral infarction (CI) and compare them with the levels
of TNF-α, IL-6 and Glu in two different models of focal
ischemia (ES and pMCAO) in order to determine
which model is more similar to human. The secondary
objectives were: 1) to analyze the relationship of these
biological markers with the severity, volume and
outcome of the brain infarction in humans and the
two stroke models; and 2) to study whether the three
biomarkers are also increased in response to damage
in organs other than the central nervous system both
in humans and in rats.

Experimental procedures
Patients
Design

This was a prospective case-control study (3:1) whose
inclusion criteria for the stroke group (cases) were:
patient of any age, symptoms of non-lacunar brain
infarction within the previous 12 hours and a brain CT
that ruled out any other cause of the neurological deficit.
The brain CT was repeated within the first week to
demonstrate the presence of a brain infarction and to
measure its volume. The hypodensity volume (mL) was
calculated in the second scan according to the formula
0.5XaXbXc (where a and b are the largest perpendicular
diameters measured in CT and c is the height). Patients
with symptoms or signs of an acute infection on admission
as well as those with a transient ischemic attack (TIA),
lacunar syndrome (pure motor stroke/hemiparesis, ataxic
hemiparesis, dysarthria/clumsy had, pure sensory stroke
and mixed sensorimotor stroke) or symptoms of brainstem
infarction were excluded. Furthermore, patients treated
with intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial reperfusion
therapies were excluded. The controls were patients with
acute non-neurological diseases with symptom onset
within the previous 12 hours. Cases and controls were
matched by gender and age (±5 years). Exclusion criteria
for the control group were: history of acute stroke in
the last year or current episode of stroke, focal or
global neurological symptoms attributable to any central
nervous system lesions (whether demonstrated or not)
and more than one acute disease at the time of the
study. Common exclusion criteria for both groups
were: underlying severe conditions including bronchial
and heart disease requiring more than 3 hospital
admissions in the last year or domiciliary oxygen
therapy; disseminated or terminal stage cancer in any
location; connective tissue disorders with current
activity at the time of evaluation; previous chronic
inflammatory diseases such as chronic bronchitis;
treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or calcium
channel blockers at symptoms onset; dementia or other
deteriorating conditions that preclude an acceptable basal
functional status, as determined by Barthel Index (BI)
scores lower than 90 and modified Rankin scale (mRS)
scores higher than 1; and a history of illicit drug abuse.
Patient management

Both cases and controls were selected among those who
came to the emergency department, according to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Stroke patients were
evaluated by a neurologist and managed in a Stroke Unit
following the acute stroke management guidelines [18]
with special attention to the surveillance of blood
pressure, serum glucose levels and body temperature.
The initial assessment of the neurological deficit by

Martínez-Sánchez et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:220

means of the National Institute of Health stroke scale
(NIHSS) was performed on admission and every 24
hours during hospitalization by certified neurologists.
Control patients were evaluated following a standard
protocol of management depending on the clinical
symptoms. The score in the APACHE II (Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scale
score was registered in cases and controls to establish
disease severity [19].
Demographic data, previous vascular risk factors and
previous treatments were recorded for both groups and
registered in a specific database. Furthermore, functional
outcomes at 3-months were evaluated by means of the
mRS and BI [20]. The mRS is a scale defined by seven
grades (0 indicates no symptoms; 1: no disability, despite
symptoms; 2: slight disability; 3: moderate disability; 4:
moderately severe disability; 5 severe disability; and 6
death). The BI consists of 10 items that measure a
person’s daily functioning, specifically the activities of
daily living and mobility. The items include feeding,
moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming,
transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on
level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing,
continence of bowels and bladder. The total scores
ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is the highest functional
dependence and 100 the maximum independence.
The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee
of La Paz University Hospital. All patients, or next kin if
patient was unable to consent, signed the informed
consent before the inclusion in the study. The informed
consent followed the standards of the Spanish law
(Boletín Oficial del Estado of November 15, 2002).

hospital. Animal handling complied with Spanish and
European guidelines (Boletín Oficial del Estado of March
18, 1988, and 86/609/EEC and 2003/65/EC European
Council Directives). All experiments were performed in
compliance with guidelines of our Ethical Committee
for the Care and Use of Animals in Research (La Paz
University Hospital). The experiments were designed to
use the smallest number of animals and to minimize their
suffering in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The results are reporting
following the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting
In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.

Blood sample management and biochemistry analysis

Laboratory analyses were performed within the first 12
hours from the onset of symptoms and at 72 hours, both in
case and controls. Blood samples were extracted by peripheral venous puncture, collected in glass tubes with EDTA
K3, centrifuged at 3000g for 15 minutes and the supernatant frozen at –80°C for storage in the biochemistry
department. Plasma levels of Glu and other amino acids
were measured for physiological amino acids by High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) following
the Pico-Tag© method (Waters Associates) [21] with minor
modifications [22]. The reference normal plasma range for
Glu in our laboratory was 25 to 110 μmol/l. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and the TNF-α were determined by ELISA (Inmunogenetics, S.A.U.). The biochemistry
physician was blind to the patients’ clinical characteristics,
including their allocation to case or control groups.
Animals

The procedure was carried out at the Neuroscience and
Cerebrovascular Research Laboratory at a university

Subjects

Adult male Long-Evans rats (weight 250 to 300g) were
used. Rats were housed with free access to food and water
and at a room temperature of 21 ± 2°C, relative humidity
of 45 ± 15% and a 12h light/ dark cycle (7:00-19:00).
Experimental groups

We conducted a randomized, blind study. Rats were
assigned to five groups: 1) ES (n = 10), which underwent
a right internal carotid artery (ICA) embolization with
autologous clot; 2) sham-operated group (n = 6) without
embolization; 3) pMCAO (n = 6) with permanent MCAO
together with transient bilateral common carotid artery
ligation for 60 min; 4) sham-operated group (n = 6)
without pMCAO; and 5) Controls which underwent tissue
stress by leg compression (LC) for 180 min (n = 6). These
animals were subjected to limb muscle compression in
back paw without carotid or cerebral damage.
After 72h, animals were re-anesthetized for euthanasia by
transcardial perfusion with a saline solution followed by fixing solution (4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde
in 10% buffered formalin phosphate).
ES model: surgical procedures

Anesthesia was induced by a solution of ketamine
(25 mg/mL), diazepam (2 mg/mL), and atropine
(0.1 mg/mL) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg by intraperitoneal
injection. Analgesia was provided by meloxicam 2
mg/kg by a subcutaneous route. The femoral vein
and artery were cannulated for continuous monitoring
of physiological parameters (glycemia, blood gases,
blood pressure and heart rate) (Monitor Schiller AG
CH 6340BAAR), and for extraction of samples. Body
temperature was also monitored and maintained at
36.5 ± 0.5°C. The external carotid artery (ECA) was
also cannulated to introduce embolus. This consisted
of a 3 mm long by 0.4 mm wide thrombus obtained
from arterial blood coagulated in a polyethylene tube
(Centracath Vygon 19 G, inside diameter 0.5 mm) at
37.5°C for 40 min. As previously described [15,23],
the thrombus was introduced into the ICA through a

Martínez-Sánchez et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:220
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/220

catheter located in the ECA, enabling the blood flow
to impel it up to the bifurcation of the intracranial
ICA where it impacts due to its diameter, causing
interruption of blood flow to the middle cerebral
artery (MCA). The location of the clot and proper
occlusion of MCA were verified by an angiography.
Angiography (Stenoscop General Electric. Exposure:
40 Kv, 0.5 mA) with 0.3 ml of non-ionic contrast
(Iohexol Omnitrast 300 Schering) was performed at
20 min after embolization to verify the arterial occlusion
and again at 120 min to check whether recanalization had
occurred. Animals that did not present arterial occlusion
after the first angiography or those that spontaneously
recanalized (animals that show MCA patency on the
second angiogram) were rejected. Using these criteria, we
ensured that all animals included in the study had an
MCA occlusion and did not present early reperfusion.
The sham-operated animals underwent the entire
surgical procedure except for embolization.
pMCAO model: surgical procedures

The anesthesia induction and the monitoring of
physiological parameters were similar to those previously
described for ES.
The surgical procedure to induce permanent focal
cerebral ischemia was a variant of that described by
Chen et al [16] and Liu et al [17]. A small craniectomy
was made above the rhinal fissure over the right MCA
branch, which was permanently ligated just before its
bifurcation between the frontal and parietal branches
with a 9-0 suture. Complete blood flow interruption
was confirmed using an operating microscope. Both
common carotid arteries were then transitorily occluded
for 180 min. A thermistor probe was placed under the
temporal muscle and over the cerebral artery region to
measure brain temperature. Transient occlusion of
common carotid arteries helps to reduce the variability of
infarct volume in this model [24].
The sham-operated animals underwent the entire
surgical procedure except for MCA ligation.
Physiological monitoring: mortality

In all animals, the femoral artery was cannulated during
surgery and ischemia for continuous monitoring of
physiological parameters (glycemia, blood gases and
blood pressure) (Monitor Omicron ALTEA RGB medical
devices). Temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5°C. A
deviation of less than 20% from normal mean values of
physiological parameters was accepted; animals with
values outside these normal limits were rejected.
In the ES, 4 rats died before the 72th hour due to the
severity of the brain infarction, and they were excluded
from the analysis. There was no mortality before the
sacrifice in the pMCAO and LC rats.

Functional evaluation

Before the procedure and at 24 and 48 hours after
surgery and leg compression, each animal was given a
score on the neurological scale described by Rogers
[25,26]: 0 = No deficit; 1 = failure to extend left forelimb;
2 = decreased grip of the left forelimb while tail
pulled; 3 = spontaneous movement in all directions,
contralateral circling if pulled by the tail; 4 = circling or
walking to the left; 5 = movement only when stimulated;
6 = unresponsive to stimulation; 7 = death.
All animals were weighed preoperatively and immediately
before the animals were euthanized at 72 hours. Postoperative weight loss as a percentage of preoperative
weight was calculated as: 100 × (preoperative weight –
pre-euthanization weight)/preoperative weight.
Evaluation of infarct volume by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)

After euthanization, the brains were removed and
fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24h at 4°C. Brains were
sectioned at the optic chiasma and at the infundibular
stalk. The resultant blocks of brain between these two
cuts were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned
into 5 μm-thick coronal slices. Every twentieth slice
(for a total of four slices [numbers 1, 21, 41 and 61],
which were separated by 100 μm from each other)
was stained with H&E. H&E staining allows for the
identification of ischemic lesions as well-defined pale
areas. The infarct volume was thus measured for
these sections as previously described [24,27]. Lesion
volumes were calculated as a percentage of the volume
of the contralateral hemisphere using the following
formula: % lesion volume = (volume of the contralateral
hemisphere – ipsilateral intact volume)/volume of
contralateral hemisphere × 100.
Cell death

Cell death was assessed by marking nuclear DNA
fragments in situ by immunohistochemistry using the
TUNEL method (biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling mediated
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; TdT-FragEL
DNA fragmentation detection kit, Oncogene Research
Products), following the manufacturer’s instructions,
and counterstaining with methyl green. TUNEL-positive
cells were counted in all animals in the same predetermined slice of brain located in the central infarct area (slice
number 46) using a 40X objective on an optic microscope
(Olympus) with analysis software (Image-Pro Plus).
In the ES, the TUNEL-positive cells were counted in
the frontal, lateral and piriform areas of the cortex, and
in the medial and lateral striatum. The mean of the five
counts in each area was calculated. Counts were made
both in the embolized and contralateral hemispheres.
The results were presented as the total for the embolized

hemisphere and then separately for the cortex and
striatum [23].
In the pMCAO, we identified cells death in the cortex
of both hemispheres based on their nuclear morphology
and the dark color [26].

and 90-day outcomes in humans

Quantification of biochemical markers

Blood samples were obtained at 3 and 72 hours after
ischemia, collected in plastic tubes containing EDTA
and then immediately centrifuged. Plasma was frozen
at -80°C until analysis.
Glu was determined by HPLC as previously described
for humans. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6
and TNF-α, were determined by ELISA (Inmunogenetics,
S.A.U.).
Data analysis

Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS
package 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois,
USA). A univariate analysis was performed with the
X2 test for dichotomous variables. Continuous variables
were tested using the t-test, the Mann-Whitney or
Wilcoxon test when appropriate. The Mann-Whitney,
and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the
values of physiological parameters, functional evaluation
scores, lesion volumes, number of TUNEL positive cells
and plasma levels for Glu and inflammatory cytokines
between the study groups, and Wilcoxon test for comparison within study groups. The Spearman correlation
coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between
Glu and cytokines, infarct size, number of TUNEL
positive cells and functional evaluation. In patients, the
correlations were adjusted by the brain infarct size,
dividing the sample into two groups: large infarcts
(third tertile) and medium sized infarcts (first and
second tertile). P-values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Patients

Fifty-one acute non-lacunar stroke patients (cases) and
seventeen acute non-neurological diseases patients
(controls) were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, vascular risk factors, disease severity and 90-day
outcomes are shown in Table 1. Cases and controls had
the same gender distribution (47% males) and similar
age 73 ± 10.3 years vs. 70.4 ± 15 years, P = 0.353).
Furthermore, there were no differences in the blood
extraction times and vascular risk factors, except for
atrial fibrillation, which was more common in the
cases than in controls (43.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.001).
APACHE II scores on admission as well as 90-day
mRS and BI scores were similar in both groups.
Seven patients died in the cases group and zero in

significant. The median (IQR) brain infarction size in
the cases group was 27.8 (78) ml.
The etiological stroke subtypes in the cases group
were: atherothrombotic (41.2%), cardioembolic (45%),
undetermined cause (11.8%) and unusual origin (1.9%).
The diseases in the control group were: bone fracture
(52.9%), acute myocardial infarction (41.1%) and pulmonary
embolism (5.8%).
Biochemical markers

Figure 1 shows the biochemical markers in patients. The
cases group tended to present lower IL-6 plasma levels

Martínez-Sánchez et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:220

than controls in the first measurement (P = 0.068), and
significantly lower levels in the second measurement
(P = 0.038). Furthermore, IL-6 plasma levels rose over
time in both groups but were significantly only in the
cases (P = 0.007) (Figure 1A). TNF-α plasma levels were
similar in the cases and control groups in the <12 h and
the 72 h measurement. Moreover, TNF-α plasma levels
increased over time in the cases and control groups,
although did not reached the statistical significance
(Figure 1B). Glu plasma levels were similar in the
cases and control groups in both the first and the
second measurement. Furthermore, the Glu levels
tended to decrease in the cases group (P = 0.053) and
did not differ over time in the control group
(Figure 1C).
Finally, stroke patients were divided according to
the timing of the first blood sample: <6 hour (35/51)
and 6-12 hours (16/51). When comparing the <6 h and
the 6-12 h groups, there were no statistically differences in
plasma levels (median [IQR]) of IL-6 (3.3 [11] vs. 4 [9.6]),
Glu (118.6 [101] vs. 87 [72]) and TNF-α (5.3 [4] vs.
6 [10.4]) (P NS).
Correlations between biochemical markers, stroke severity,
volume of infarct and stroke outcome

Figure 1 Plasma biochemical markers in patients, median (IQR).
A: IL-6 plasma levels. B: TNF-a plasma levels. C: Glu plasma levels.
Normal values range: IL-6 ≈ 1-6 pg/ml [28,29], TNF-a ≈ 5-10 pg/ml
[28,30], Glu ≈ 20-60 μmol/L [31,32]. IQR means interquartile range;
IL-6, interleukin 6; TNF-a, TNF-alpha; Glu, glutamate plasma levels.

Table 2 shows the correlations between biochemical
markers and clinical and neuroimaging parameters in
patients. In stroke patients, correlations were found
between IL-6 at <12 h and clinical severity in the case of
patients with large infarcts. IL-6 at <12 h showed a
tendency towards a positive correlation with 3-month
mRS in patients with large infarcts. IL-6 at 72 h correlated
with clinical severity, stroke severity, volume of infarct
and 3-month mRS in all stroke patients, as well as with
stroke severity in patients with medium-sized infarcts.
TNF-α levels at <12 h correlated with infarct volume in all
stroke patients and in the large subtype. Furthermore
TNF-α levels at <12 h correlated with 3-month mRS. Glu
levels at <12 h did not show any significant correlation
with clinical/neuroimaging parameters in stroke patients.
Glu at 72 h tended towards a positive correlation with
stroke severity in all patients and showed a significant
correlation with stroke severity in patients with
medium-sized infarcts.
In the control group, IL-6 at <12 h tended towards a
negative correlation with the 3-month BI score. IL-6 at 72 h
also correlated with clinical severity in the control group.
TNF-α did not correlate with any of these parameters
in the control group. Glu at <12 h tended towards a
correlation with clinical severity in all control subjects,
while Glu at 72 h correlated negatively with clinical severity in large infarct control group. Moreover, Glu at 72 h
correlated positively with clinical outcome measured by
the BI (Table 2).

Animal models

Physiological parameters remained within normal limits
throughout the procedure and there were no significant
differences between the groups.
Six rats underwent the ES, six the pMCAO and
another six the LC. The infarct volume, cell death,
functional evaluation and post-operative weight loss in
ES and pMCAO are shown in Table 3. ES showed brain
infarct affecting the cortex and the striatum, but the
infarcts in the pMCAO affected only the cortex. Thus,
the infarct volume was significantly higher in the ES
(infarct volume median in terms of percentage of right
hemisphere) (Table 3 and Figure 2A). However, the
percentage of post-operative weight loss was similar in

both groups. Cell death measured as the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in the infarction was higher in
the cortex of pMCAO rats (Table 3 and Figure 2B).
Furthermore, the functional evaluation was poorer in the
ES at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (Table 3).
Biochemical markers

The biochemical marker levels in the five groups of rats
are shown in Figure 3. The ES had higher IL-6 plasma
levels than the pMCAO rats in both the 3 h and 72 h
measurements (P = 0.002). Furthermore, the IL-6 plasma
levels were higher in the ES than the LC group (P = 0.002).
The IL-6 plasma levels were higher in the ES than in its
sham at 3 h (P = 0.002) but not at 72 h. There were no

differences in any IL-6 plasma level between the pMCAO
and its sham. IL-6 levels at 3 h were similar between
pMCAO and LC but, at 72 h, were higher in
pMCAO (P = 0.009). The IL-6 plasma levels increased
significantly over time in the ES (P = 0.046), but not
in the pMCAO or LC groups (Figure 3A).
Regarding the TNF-α (Figure 3B), the ES showed
higher plasma levels than the pMCAO at 3 h (P = 0.002)
and 72 h (P = 0.002). Moreover, TNF-α levels at 3 h
and 72 h were higher in ES than in LC (P = 0.026
and P = 0.002, respectively) rats. TNF-α levels were
lower in pMCAO than in LC at 3 h (P = 0.002) but
not at 72 h. The TNF-α plasma levels were higher for
the ES than for its sham at 3 h (P = 0.004) but not at
72 h, and higher for the pMCAO than for its sham both
at 3 h (P = 0.015) and at 72 h (P = 0.002). Furthermore,
TNF-α increased over time in both ischemic models
(P = 0.027 for the ES, and P = 0.028 for the pMCAO)
but remained stable in the LC group.
Regarding the Glu (Figure 3C), the ES presented lower
plasma levels than the pMCAO at 3 h (P = 0.002) and at
72 h (P = 0.002). There were no differences in Glu levels
between the ES or pMCAO and their corresponding
shams. Moreover, Glu levels were lower in ES than in
LC at 3 h (P = 0.002) and 72 h (P = 0.004), although
there were no significant differences between pMCAO
and LC. The plasma Glu levels increased over time in
ES (P = 0.028), pMCAO and LC (P = 0.028).
Correlations between biochemical markers, functional
evaluation, volume of infarct and cell death

In the ES, significant correlations were found between
IL-6 levels at 3 h and cell death in the cortex. Furthermore,
there was a tendency towards a correlation between Glu at
3 h and cell death in the cortex. TNF-α levels at 3 h tended
to be correlated with cell death in the cortex. Moreover,
Glu levels at 72 h were positively correlated with infarct
volume (Table 4).

On the other hand, the only significant correlation
found in the pMCAO was a negative correlation between
TNF-α levels at 72h and cell death in the cortex (Table 4).

Discussion
This study shows significant differences in the biomarker
profile between the ES and pMCAO model and, in
turn, between them and stroke patients. Of the three
biomarkers studied, IL-6 emerges as the most closely
related to clinical severity, stroke severity, infarct volume
and clinical outcome in stroke patients, although Glu also
correlated with stroke severity (but not with outcome)
and TNF-alpha levels with infarct volume and outcome.
Regarding the two animal models of brain ischemia, the
ES showed a higher infarct, IL-6 temporal profile more
similar to humans, as well as correlations between the
three biomarkers, cell death and infarct volume that were
more similar to humans than pMCAO. However, the
three biomarkers were nonspecific of brain ischemia both
in humans and rats.
It is well known that IL-6 is associated with END [6],
greater infarct volumes [7,33] and poor outcomes [8,34]
in stroke patients. In our results, IL-6 levels increased
over time in stroke patients and were correlated with
clinical severity, stroke severity, infarct volume and
long-term clinical outcomes. Even in medium-sized
brain infarction, IL-6 levels correlated with stroke severity,
confirming the predictor value of this cytokine in ischemic
stroke patients. However, the elevation of IL-6 levels was
also correlated with increased clinical severity and poorer
outcomes in control patients, showing that this biomarker
is not specific to cerebral ischemia. Indeed, IL-6 is a
multifunctional cytokine produced by various types of
cells and regulates the immune response, hematopoiesis,
the acute phase response and inflammation [35] and is
related to mortality and severity of acute diseases in the
Emergency Department [36]. In the present study, IL-6
levels were correlated with cell death in cortex in the ES

but not in the pMCAO. Furthermore, IL-6 increased with
time in humans and ES, but not in pMCAO. Interestingly,
IL-6 levels were markedly higher in ES than in pMCAO
and LC, which may be a marker of a more aggressive
surgical procedure in ES and may also explain the higher
mortality and larger stroke sizes in this model.
TNF-α, another classic pro-inflammatory cytokine, is
released early into cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the
acutely infracted brain of humans [10] and rodents [37].
In this study, TNF-α plasma levels correlated with
apoptotic cell death in the cortex of ES rats. Previous
studies have shown that TNF-α, together with IL-1β,
induces a secondary inflammatory response mediated by
IL-6 and IL-8, which appears to exacerbate cerebral
ischemic injury [9,10]. Moreover, TNF-α plasma levels
correlated with infarct volume and with stroke outcome.
Although there are no previous studies in humans to
compare these data, it is known that TNF-α expression is
upregulated in response to ischemia and injury [11,38].
Furthermore, TNF-α plasma levels tended to increase over
time and were no different in the cases and controls
groups. In our animal models of brain ischemia, TNF-α
increased over time in both ES and pMCAO, although
they were higher in ES. The increase over time of TNF-α
is striking because experimental studies show that the
expression of TNF-α is detected as early as 1 hour after
focal ischemia [37], peaks within 12 hours and rapidly
decreases over the next 12 to 48 hours. However, these
studies directly analyzed TNF-α expression in cortex
sections whereas the temporal profile of this biomarker in
plasma is unknown. In this study, the human controls, the
ES shams and the LC model also had temporal increases
in TNF-α plasma levels, showing the non-specific nature
of this pro-inflammatory cytokine. Indeed, TNF-α serum
levels can be increased with time after injury in other
tissues, as is the case with severe burns, in both human
and rats [35,39].
In our cohort of stroke patients, Glu plasma levels
were correlated with stroke severity. Previous studies
have also shown that plasma Glu concentration are
associated with stroke severity [13], as well as with
early neurological worsening [12], infarct growth and
volume of tissue at risk of infarction [14]. Regarding
the animal models in this study, plasma Glu levels
were correlated with infarct volume and cell death in
the cortex, but only in ES, showing a greater similarity to
humans. Glu plasma levels tended to decrease with time
in stroke patients, which is in accordance with previous
studies that show lower levels of this EAA in stable
strokes [13,14]. We did not specifically evaluate, in our
patients, the stability of brain infarcts in the first 24 hours;
however, initial Glu plasma levels were relatively low
(median 105.6 μmol/l). Considering that Glu concentrations >200 μmol/l within the first 24 hours from stroke

onset have been associated with early infarct progression
and END [13,14], we expected that the most of the patients
had stable brain infarcts. However, in animal models of
brain ischemia, Glu levels significantly increase over time,
which could be explained by various hypotheses. First of
all, the size of the brain infarction may play an important
role in Glu release. In our study, the brain infarction in
humans was relatively small, with a median volume around
28 ml, which is equivalent to 5% of the volume of the
hemisphere [40]. However, the ES model produced large
infarctions affecting, on average, more than 50% of the
hemisphere. In humans, infarcts consistently greater than
39% of the ipsilateral hemisphere are malignant infarctions
and develop substantial edema and progressive infarct
expansion [41]. Thus, the elevation of Glu plasma levels
over time in ES may indicate, as previously described in
humans [14,42], a progression of the brain infarction, although we have not specifically measured this. Secondly,
the pMCAO model produced significantly smaller infarctions (29% of the hemisphere, on average) but showed even
greater Glu plasma levels than ES, which also increased
over time. This could be explained by the surgical procedure of this model that involves the direct manipulation of
the brain. In fact, it has been previously reported that brain
stimulation increases EAA levels, both in humans and animal models [43]. On the other hand, Glu levels were similar
between stroke patients and controls, as well as between
rats with brain ischemia and their corresponding shams,
indicating that Glu levels are not specific to brain tissue
lesions, which is similar to inflammatory cytokines. Futhermore, Glu levels increased over time in the LC model, even
though were above the levels in the ES model. Previous
studies have reported that Glu is released after stressful
systemic stimulus both in animals [44] and humans [45].
In this study we studied the plasma levels of three
biological markers involved in cerebral ischemia without
considering recanalization, to avoid the effect of ischemia/
reperfusion injury on inflammatory biomarker release.
Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the
reperfusion may exacerbate the injury initially caused by
ischemia by increasing the leukocyte infiltration, activating
platelets and complement, developing post-ischemic
hyperperfusion and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier
[46]. Furthermore, the ischemia/reperfusion injury amplifies
the inflammatory response by inducing the release of several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α.
To analyze the biomarkers related only to brain ischemia,
we included preclinical models of stroke, where the absence
of recanalization can be easily monitored, and we excluded
stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapies.
This study has some limitations, one of which is the
small sample size of humans and rats. Furthermore, the
number of controls in the human group is unbalanced relative to the number of strokes. This is the first comparative

study of stroke patients and two animal models of brain
ischemia, so it was initially planned as a pilot study with
the minimum required sample. However, we have
found significant similarities and differences between
the animal models and humans, as well as the correlations
between plasma biomarkers and clinical data. This
new information allows us to expand current knowledge
about animal models of focal ischemia in order to improve
their applications when testing therapies for stroke.
Another limitation is the use of similar temporal
windows for plasma analyses in both humans and
rats, two animals with very different life expectancy.
Is it not known how this can affect the comparison
of the data. Finally, the methodology used to assess the
infarct volume in stroke patients has been developed
in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage and its utility in
brain infarct is not clear.

In conclusion, the three biomarkers studied in humans
(IL-6, Glu and TNF-α) have different temporal profiles
and are non-specific to cerebral injury. However, they
establish good correlations with disease severity and
outcomes. Similarly, IL-6, Glu and TNF-α are non-specific
to cerebral ischemia in biomarker studies in rats. The ES
model shows higher infarct volumes and inflammatory
biomarkers levels than pMCAO, although the latter
had increased levels of serum Glu. However ES shows
correlations between the biomarkers, cell death and
infarct volume more similar to humans than pMCAO.
Both models, ES and pMCAO, show differences that
should be considered when conducting translational
studies. Larger studies are needed to confirm our data
and to clarify how the differences found between the
two experimental rat models of brain ischemia may
affect the success of drug trials.
