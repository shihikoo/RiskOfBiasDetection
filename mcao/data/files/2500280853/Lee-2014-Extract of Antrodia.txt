In this study, the neuroprotective effect of an extract of Antrodia camphorata (A. camphorata), a fungus commonly used in Chinese
folk medicine for treatment of viral hepatitis and cancer, alone or in combination with aspirin was investigated in a rat embolic
stroke model. An ischemic stroke was induced in rats by a selective occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with whole
blood clots and then orally treated with A. camphorata (0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day) alone and combined with aspirin (5 mg/kg/day).
Sixty days later, the brains were removed, sectioned, and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and analysed by a commercial
image processing software program. Brain infarct volume, neurobehavioral score, cerebral blood perfusion, and subarachnoid
and intracerebral hemorrhage incidence were perceived. In addition, potential bleeding side effect of the combinative therapy
was assessed by measuring hemoglobin (Hb) content during intracerebral hemorrhage and gastric bleeding, prothrombin time
(PT), and occlusion time (OT) after oral administration. Posttreatment with high dose A. camphorata significantly reduced infarct
volume and improved neurobehavioral score (P < 0.05). Since A. camphorata alone or with aspirin did not alter the Hb level, this
treatment is safe and does not cause hemorrhagic incident. Remarkably, the combination of A. camphorata and aspirin did not show
a significant effect on the bleeding time, PT and OT increase suggesting that A. camphorata may have the neuroprotective effect
without the prolongation of bleeding time or coagulation time. From these observations, we suggest that combinative therapy of A.
camphorata and aspirin might offer enhanced neuroprotective efficacies without increasing side effects.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second most leading cause of death and the first
cause of major adult disability in the world [1, 2]. Among
the stroke patients, 85–90% of the cases are ischaemic stroke
with a major (75–80%) cause of cerebral arterial thrombosis,
and majorities of ischaemic incidents ensue as a result of

occlusion of the middle cerebral artery [3, 4]. Mortality and
serious disability result if patients are not treated successfully
within 30–90 min after onset of symptoms. Aspirin is the
most widely used drug for the secondary prevention of
thrombotic events, due to its antiplatelet action. It is effective
for the prevention of secondary stroke and has been used
in up to 89% of patients in China. Nevertheless, while

2

recurrent stroke is controlled by this treatment, the incidence
of cerebral haemorrhage and other bleeding events is higher
in Asian countries than in high-income countries [5]. Hence,
combinations of antiplatelet drugs that act on different pathways have been used to overcome the risk of haemorrhage.
These compounds have been shown to be used efficiently
and safely in patients with unstable coronary heart disease.
Recent studies have revealed that the combination of two
antiplatelet drugs is disastrous to recover stroke prevention
rates owing to the increased risk of bleeding events associated
with their long-term use [6, 7]. Bleeding due to antiplatelet
drugs is a vital clinical issue in primary and secondary
stroke prevention, mostly in the Chinese population, which
has a higher incidence of cerebral haemorrhage than other
indigenous groups [8].
A. camphorata is one of the complementary alternative
medicines. It is a parasitic fungus that only grows on the inner
heartwood wall of Cinnamomum kanehirai Hay (Lauraceae).
A. camphorata is usually used in Taiwanese folk medicine
for abdominal pain, chemical intoxication, diarrhea, hypertension, itchy skin, and hepatoma [9]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that A. camphorata induces significant apoptosis of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells [10].
Another study proved that A. camphorata extracts may be
used as an adjuvant antitumor agent for human hepatoma
cells, which are resistant to most other antitumor agents.
Our previous study demonstrated that A. camphorata owns
effective protection against carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4 -)
induced hepatic injury in vivo, by mediating antioxidative
and free radical scavenging activities [11], and it has shown
to reduce H2 O2 -induced lipid peroxidation and upregulating
hepatic glutathione-dependent enzymes for protecting the rat
liver from the CCl4 -induced damage [12].
The embolic model has been used previously in different
experiments to induce experimental stroke in rodents [13],
as this model mimics human stroke and is more relevant to
the pathophysiological situation in patients. Besides, different
sizes of lesion could be created in this model by injection
of various volumes of clot into the middle cerebral artery
[14]. Therefore, we investigated whether a combination of
A. camphorata with the lowest effective dose of aspirin may
provide more neuroprotection during the embolic model of
stroke in rats without increasing the potential bleeding side
effect and different hemorrhagic incidents.

all animals were clinically normal, free of apparent infection
or inflammation and showed no neurological deficits.

2. Materials and Methods

2.5. Quantification of Brain Infarct Volume. Rats were euthanized by decapitation after 24 h of reperfusion. The
brains were cut into 2 mm coronal slices starting 1 mm
from the frontal pole. Each stained brain (2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium; TTC) slice was drawn using a computerized image analyzer (Image-Pro Plus). The calculated
infarct areas were then compiled to obtain the infarct
volume (mm3 ) per brain. Infarct volumes were expressed
as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume
using the formula (the area of the intact contralateral [left]
hemisphere—the area of the intact region of the ipsilateral
[right] hemisphere) to compensate for edema formation in
the ipsilateral hemisphere [15].

2.1. Plant Material. The crude extracts of A. camphorata were
offered by Well Shine Biotechnology Development Co., Pvt.
Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan.
2.2. Animals. Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were
used to assess the effects of A. camphorata given alone
or in combination with aspirin on MCAO-induced brain
damage. Animal care and the general protocols for animal
use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of Taipei Medical University (no. LAC101-0239). Before undergoing the experimental procedures,

2.3. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion- (MCAO-) Induced
Ischemia. Rats were subjected to MCAO-induced ischemia
by administration of an autologous blood clot as described
in our previous study [15]. Briefly, arterial blood (0.6 mL)
was withdrawn from a femoral catheter in a 1 mL syringe.
The blood was immediately injected into PE-10 tubes. The
tubes were kept at 4∘ C for 22 h, and the thread-like clots were
removed and placed in a saline-filled dish. The clots were then
washed to remove blood cells. Washed portions of the clots
were transferred to fresh dishes, and the washing process was
repeated until the saline remained clear. These clot sections
were cut into 30 mm long fragments and then drawn up with
the saline solution into a PE-10 catheter.
On the day of surgery, animals were anesthetized with a
mixture of 75% air and 25% O2 gases containing 3% isoflurane. The common carotid artery (CCA) was identified, and
approximately 1 cm of the external carotid artery (ECA) was
ligated and cut. Subsequently, the pterygopalatine artery (PA)
was clamped with a 10 mm microaneurysm clamp, and the
CCA was similarly clamped before the carotid bifurcation.
The internal carotid artery (ICA) was then clamped between
the carotid bifurcation and the PA. Next, the PE-50 catheter
containing the clot was introduced approximately 5 mm into
the previously cut ECA and tied in place with sutures. The
ICA clamp was removed, and the clot was flushed into the
ICA over a period of approximately 5 s. The PA clamp was
removed, and the rat was left in this condition for 1 h.
2.4. Experimental Design. In this study, at 1 hr after MCA
occlusion, rats were randomly separated into six groups: (1)
a sham-operated group; (2) a group orally treated with an
isovolumetric solvent (distilled water) for 60 days, followed
by thromboembolic occlusion; (3 and 4) groups orally treated
with A. camphorata (0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day) alone for 60
days, followed by thromboembolic occlusion, respectively;
and (5 and 6) groups treated with A. camphorata (0.25 and
0.75 g/kg/day) and aspirin (5 mg/kg/day), followed by thromboembolic occlusion, respectively. An observer blinded to the
identity of the groups assessed the neurological deficits after
reperfusion (before being euthanized) by forelimb akinesia
(also called the postural tail-hang) test.

2.6. Neurological Functional Tests. Sensorimotor integrity
was measured in rats at 1 and 24 h after MCAO by an
investigator blind to the experimental groups to assess the
neurobehavior [16]. Scoring was as follows: 0: no observable
deficit, 1: forelimb flexion, 2: forelimb flexion plus decreased
resistance to lateral push, 3: unidirectional circling, and 4:
unidirectional circling plus decreased level of consciousness.
2.7. Evaluation of Hemorrhagic Incidence. As previously published, hemoglobin content in the ischemic hemisphere
and gastric luminal fluid was determined as an index of
intracerebral hemorrhage and gastric bleeding using a colorimetric method as described by a kit (Haemoglobin, HG1539)
purchased from Randox Lab Ltd., UK. The hemoglobin
content in ischemic hemisphere and gastric luminal fluid was
determined by using the optical density readings obtained
from the known hemoglobin standards and reported in g/dL.

2.8. Grading System for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH).
The rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia at 60 days after
surgery and the brains were removed rapidly. High resolution
pictures of the base of the brain depicting the circle of Willis
and basilar arteries were taken. In the photographs, the basal
cistern was shown in Figure 1(a). This grading was done by a
blinded observer.

2.10. Measurement of Occlusion Time (OT). As described
previously [15], mice were anesthetized, and an external
jugular vein was cannulated with PE-10 so that dye and
medication could be administered by an intravenous (i.v.)
bolus. A segment of the small intestine was placed onto
a transparent culture dish for microscopic observation.
Venules (30 to 40 𝜇m) were selected for irradiation to produce
a microthrombus. Using the epi-illumination system, light
from a 100 W mercury lamp was passed through a B-2A
filter (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a DM 510 dichromic mirror
(Nikon). Wavelengths below 520 nm had been eliminated
from the filtered light, which was used to irradiate a microvessel; the area of irradiation was approximately 100 𝜇m in
diameter on the focal plane. A dose of 0.75 g/kg/dayof A.
camphorata was administered 3 min after fluorescein sodium
administration. Five minutes after administration of the
fluorescein sodium, irradiation by filtered light and the video
timer were simultaneously begun, and occlusion time was

2.9. Measurement of Prothrombin Time (PT). Measurement
of prothrombin time (PT) was performed by using a kit
(Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy) as described [17].
Briefly, just before ligation to form a snare in the rat Wessler
model, arterial blood samples (3 mL) were withdrawn; then
the artery was ligated immediately; 0.9 mL of each blood
sample was transferred into a 0.109 M trisodium citrate
solution (1 : 9, v/v) and then centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10 min
to obtain plasma. 100 𝜇L plasma was mixed with 50 𝜇L of
cephalin in a process plate, and the coagulation was started
by the addition of CaCl2 (1 mM), 100 𝜇L of thromboplastin,
and 100 𝜇L of bovine thrombin into the 100 𝜇L of incubated
plasma for PT assay.

3.2. A. camphorata Treatment Improves Neurological Outcome and Blood Perfusion Deficit. Variations of neurological
deficits scores in different groups are shown in Figure 2(a).
Before MCAO, the neurological score was zero in all animals.
After MCAO, high-grade neurological deficits (𝑃 < 0.001)
were present. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, treatment with A. camphorata significantly and dose-dependently
improved the neurological score at 24 h after ischemia (𝑃 <
0.05). In addition, compared with other blood perfusion unit
(BPU) or regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measuring
methods, laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF; Oxford Array)
provides a noninvasive and continuous measure of BPU.
Figure 2(b) shows the relative changes of BPU by LDF after
MCAO, 30 and 60 days of A. camphorata treatment alone.
The results show that MCAO-induced animals sustained
the most severe (𝑃 < 0.001) reduction in BPU. However,
the low (0.25 g/kg/day) and high (0.75 g/kg/day) dose of A.
camphorata treatment decreased the BPU compared with the
vehicle, although there were no significant differences. All
rats in the sham group maintained the baseline level of BPU.

3.1. A. camphorata and Aspirin Combination Therapy Reduces
Infarct Volume. The cerebral infarction was examined using
2 mm thick slices of the cerebrum 24 h after MCAO reperfusion in rats through TTC staining. Figure 1(a) shows
typical photographs of coronal sections of sham-operated
group, MCAO-treated group, A. camphorata-alone-treated
groups (0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day), and A. camphorata + aspirin
(5 mg/kg/day) treated groups prior to the ischemic insult.
At 24 h after MCAO, a high dose of A. camphorata treatment alone or combination treatment with aspirin reduced
the infarct volume, both of which were more significantly
reduced than the volume of MCAO-induced untreated
group (Figure 1(b)). In addition, while even a high dose
(0.75 g/kg/day) of A. camphorata combined with aspirin
(5 mg/kg/day) did not show any significant effect on reducing
the infarct volumes (Figure 1(b)), as it is found to be almost
comparable to that of high dose A. camphorata treatment
alone, the aspirin has been removed in the following studies.

can be well recognized in the sham group. Although there
is no severe effect in the SAH + MCAO group, a very little
obliterated artery by the blood clot was seen. Furthermore,
we found that treatment of A. camphorata (0.75 g/kg/day)
alone or combination with aspirin (5 mg/kg/day) did not
induce subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, the concentration of hemoglobin in the ischemic hemisphere and
gastric luminal fluid in sham-operated and A. camphorata
alone or combined with aspirin groups is almost similar
(Figures 3(b) and 3(c)). Since there is no significant effect
of A. camphorata at high dose alone or with aspirin on
hemoglobin content, this treatment method is considered

to be safer and does not cause any side effect. In addition,
to check the intracerebral hemorrhage and gastric bleeding
in studied animals hemoglobin content in the ischemic
hemisphere and gastric luminal fluid was determined. The
results revealed that the levels of hemoglobin were not
altered in all the groups, which indicate that there are no
side effects found during the treatment of A. camphorata,
aspirin alone, or combination of both in MCAO-induced
rats.
3.4. Effects of A. camphorata on Prothrombin Time (PT)
and Occlusion Time (OT). To determine whether or not
coagulation parameters are influenced by A. camphorata
treatment alone or its combination with aspirin, PT and
OT were measured in the present study. A. camphorata
alone or with aspirin did not cause a prolongation of PT
(Figure 4(a)), an observation which is at variance with a
previously reported study [18]. Nevertheless, this treatment
significantly (𝑃 < 0.01) increased prolongation of OT for
inducing thrombus formation in mesenteric venules in mice
when compared with fluorescein dye- (Sigma Aldrich, USA)
induced untreated group (Figure 4(b)).

4. Discussion
There are numerous animal stroke models which were designated in the previous literature such as photochemically
induced MCAO, surgical occlusion, and vessel occlusion
which only simulated the aspect of vessel occlusion [18]; some
aspects of human strokes can only be reproduced by these
models. An ideal animal model, which resembles human
embolic strokes as closely as possible, should be based on
the thromboembolic occlusion of a large feeder artery. In
the current study, the thromboembolic stroke model mimics
human strokes more closely than do other models of cerebral ischemia [19]. Besides, animal thromboembolic strokes
induced by blood clots simplify the investigation of the effects
of thrombolytic therapy, which is currently the only available
stroke treatment in humans. Cerebral ischemia restricted
to the distribution of the thromboembolic occlusion gives
rise to focal metabolic disturbances that result in infarction,
neuronal necrosis, and brain edema [20]. In the present study,
it is confirmed, for the first time, that oral treatment of an
extract of A. camphorata suppresses thromboembolic stroke
in rats by reducing infarct volume, improves neurological
outcome, and provides neuroprotection.

Novel cellular and pharmacological therapeutic approaches are required to raise the capacity of the brain for
neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity to reduce neurological
deficits after stroke [21]. In the current study, we studied
the neuroprotective effect of an extract of A. camphorata
and aspirin combination treatment after an experimentally
induced embolic stroke in rats. Notably, we found that
administration of a combination treatment of A. camphorata
in doses of 0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day administered 24 h after
MCAO significantly improved neurological functional outcome, reduced infarct volume, and kept sustained subarachnoid hemorrhagein rats at 60 days after MCAO. Our results
also show that treatment with A. camphorata alone or with
aspirin 24 h after MCAO resulted in no significant changes
of hemorrhagic incidence, as there is no variation found in
the levels of hemoglobin in cerebral hemorrhage and gastric
bleeding of the ischemic hemisphere in sham, A. camphorata

alone or in combination with aspirin groups. On the other
hand, A. camphorata therapy alone or combined with aspirin
had no effect on prothrombin time, whereas this treatment
prolongs occlusion time. Together, our results demonstrate
that combining A. camphorata with aspirin treatment has
an additive effect on the treatment of this thromboembolic
model of stroke.
The most commonly used tool for measuring the efficacy of neuroprotective compounds is TTC staining. Brain
lesion identified by TTC staining indicates that tissues
were irreversibly impaired in mitochondrial function and
dehydrogenase activity [22]. Our study demonstrated that
treatment with A. camphorata (0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day)
significantly decreased the volume of infarction following
cerebral ischemia insult. It was implied that A. camphorata
treatment could improve mitochondrial activity after brain
ischemia. Behind stroke, animals consequently display a
variety of neurological deficits. It is very imperative to assess
neurological function outcome after stroke. The Bederson
scale is a global neurological assessment that was developed
to measure neurological impairments following stroke [23].
Our results revealed that A. camphorata alone at doses
0.25 and 0.75 g/kg/day could improve neurological behavior
disturbance based on neurological deficit scores.
The duration of the ischemia and the degree of CBF
or BPU reduction are the major factors to determine the
severity of ischemic damage. It is generally accepted that
>70% reductions in CBF are necessary to induce ischemic
brain damage although some recent evidence suggests that
more modest reductions may cause delayed neuronal death
[24]. It was also reported that cortical injury was related to
the duration of ischemia between 30 and 45 min, and beyond
37 min both magnitude and distribution of cortical injury
increased markedly in a linear fashion [25]. In the present
study, at 30 and 60 days MCAO induced an immediate
reduction of BPU value. However, the BPU was improved
in both low (0.25 mg/kg/day) and high (0.75 g/kg/day) dose
groups of A. camphorata treatment. The increased BPU in
the MCAO-induced rats may perhaps directly determine
the volume of infarction. Therefore it is suggested that
in our study the marked reductions of infarct volume in
A. camphorata-treated groups may mainly result from the
improved BPU in the brain during MCAO.
Increased risk of hemorrhage is a documented possible
side effect of antithrombotic treatments [26]. To evaluate
this aspect, the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) grade was
checked to know the possible side effect of A. camphorata
alone or in combination with aspirin treatment on MCAOinduced rats. The results revealed that A. camphorata alone
or in combination with aspirin treatment did not affect this
parameter. On the other hand a literature about secondary
intracerebral bleeding after stroke in rats is reported to be
poor and hence bleeding rates in animals and humans may
differ [27]. In this study, we focused on the efficacy of A.
camphorata alone or with aspirin on hemoglobin content as
a marker of bleeding and an important safety measure, and
we found that there is no alteration in the hemoglobin level.
To determine whether or not coagulation parameters and
platelet functional marker are influenced by A. camphorata

The Scientific World Journal
or their combination with aspirin, PT and OT were measured
in the present study. A. camphorata or aspirin alone did
not cause a prolongation of PT, an observation which is
at variance with a previously reported study [17]. However,
A. camphorata at the dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day increased the
prolongation of OT. This prompts the conclusion that coagulation cascade did not part the bleeding interaction with the
combination of A. camphorata with aspirin.
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated
that pretreatment with Antrodia camphorata (0.25 and
0.75 g/kg/day) is beneficial in reducing infarct volume in the
focal ischemic brain injury in the embolic model. A. camphorata treatment is also beneficial in reestablishing blood flow to
the ischemic brain by reducing perfusion deficits following
ischemia and it also provides added benefits, as it did not
cause any hemorrhagic incidence when used in conjunction
with aspirin therapy. This evidence suggests that A. camphorata has neuroprotective effect against ischemic insults in
our MCAO model through a mechanism of blood perfusion
regulation without increasing hemorrhagic transformation.
