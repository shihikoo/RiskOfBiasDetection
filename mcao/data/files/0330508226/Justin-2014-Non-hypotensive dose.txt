a b s t r a c t
The hypothesis of the present study is that the anti-inﬂammatory property of telmisartan (TM), an AT1 blocker
that may exert neuroprotection through attenuation of excitatory amino acids by controlling cytokines and reactive oxygen species, release during ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of TM and its combination with
nimodipine (NM) were studied in rats by using middle cerebral artery occlusion method followed by ischemic
reperfusion (IR) after 2 h of occlusion. The drugs were administered 30 min prior to the surgery and continued
throughout the study period. After 24 h of IR the neurological deﬁcit was assessed, and the locomotor activity
and open ﬁeld behaviour were assessed on the seventh day. On the ninth day, the brains were isolated for neurochemical and cytokine measurements and histopathological studies. The results have shown that treatment of
TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) gradually reduced the glutamate, aspartate and glutamine synthetase levels. It also restored
the ATP, Na+K+ATPase, glutathione and synapse integrity in the different regions of the brain in comparison to
ischemic brain. TM ameliorated the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), lipid peroxide and nitric
oxide levels. Anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 level was found to be concurrently increased. Combination therapy of TM with NM (5 mg/kg) has shown additive effects in the above said parameters. Further a positive correlation between glutamate and cytokine release was observed, and it indicated that synaptic clearance of
glutamate can be regulated by cytokines. It can be concluded that TM induces neuroprotective activity through
amelioration of pro-inﬂammatory cytokine release during cerebral ischemia. The additive effect of NM on TM
neuroprotective effect would be through controlling cytokine release, ATP restoration by cerebrovasodilation,
and along with prevention of Ca2+ dependent glutamate toxicity in neurons. The advantage of TM therapy in ischemic state can be explored clinically due to its dual effect in hypertension.

1. Introduction
Decreased cerebral blood ﬂow mediated deprivation of oxygen,
energy metabolites and micronutrients could increase intracellular
cytosolic calcium level (Ca2 +), and release excitatory amino acids
(EAAs), toxic free-radicals, and cytokines. It could also precipitate
acidosis which might exacerbate the cerebral ischemia (Siesjo, 1992a,
1992b). Among the events, excitotoxicity plays a crucial role in
the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Glutamate is the major EAA
in the brain, and produces neuronal injury and cell death during cerebral ischemic condition via Ca2 + dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor signalling (Rothman and Olney, 1986). Glutamate
induced excitotoxicity is controlled through clearance of glutamate at
the synapse predominantly through GLT-1 (glutamate transporter-1)
(Danbolt, 2001; Beart and O'Shea, 2007). Glutamate release and Ca2+
mediated toxicity occur simultaneously in the neurons during ischemic
condition. Nimodipine, a central Ca2 + channel blocker (NM) was
studied widely in this condition because of its blood brain barrier (BBB)
permeability and cerebral vasodilatation property. Post-ischemic administration of NM restored the energy levels and protected the hippocampus
and cortical regions in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) rats
(Babu and Ramanathan, 2009). NM exhibited anti-inﬂammatory activity
through the control of cytokine levels in vascular dementia (Zhang
et al., 2012), amyloid beta treated N13 microglial cell model (Sanz et al.,
2012) and also in patients affected with cerebral haemorrhage (Zhicong
et al., 2010). Li et al. (2009) have reported neuroprotection in dopamine
neurons treated with NM and this effect was attributed due to inhibition
of microglial mediated oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response.
Angiotensin receptor-1 (AT1) blockers have shown neuroprotective role in ischemic state. Experimental ﬁndings have shown that
pre-ischemic treatment of telmisartan (TM) (5 mg/kg) suppressed
the cerebral injury in a murine model of transient focal ischemia
and the effect was attributed to anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant
effects (Kasahara et al., 2010). Recent studies have shown that TM
directly decreased the neuronal inﬂammatory response through
attenuated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression and partial blockade
of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK/c-Jun) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase pathways in neuronal culture
(Pang et al., 2012).
In preclinical studies, control of cytokine release or prevention of its
action during ischemic state has exhibited neuroprotective effect.
Among the cytokines, IL-1β elevation played a signiﬁcant role in neuroprotection during ischemia. In clinical condition, IL-1β and tumour
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are the major cytokines that exhibited inﬂammatory role in the patients affected by stroke. Recent studies have
shown that the excess production of inﬂammatory cytokines during
neurodegeneration impaired the glutamate uptake into the astrocytes
as well as microglia that may be the key factor of neurodegeneration.
Expression and function of GLT-1 by primary astrocytes were suppressed in vitro following exposure to IL-1β and TNF-α (Szymocha
et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2003; Korn et al., 2005). Further, TNF-α is the
key cytokine that stimulates extensive microglial glutamate release
in an autocrine manner by up-regulating glutaminase to cause
excitotoxicity (Takeuchi et al., 2006). Therefore it can be stated that
control of cytokine release might prevent glutamate elevation during
ischemia.
Hence, it is clear that many factors might contribute to the pathology
of cerebral ischemia. Therefore, multiple approaches are required to
protect neurons in cerebral ischemic condition. Hence, the present
study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of nonhypotensive doses of TM (Kasahara et al., 2010) and its combination
with NM in MCAo model. In post-ischemic state, the downstream
responses are through multiple mechanisms, hence the effect of the
drug in controlling EAA, cytokine, and energy levels was studied. A special emphasis has been given to understand the correlation of cytokines
with EAA. The proposed additive effect of NM with TM on MCAo will

give additional value in the treatment of stroke condition because
both drugs control blood pressure; one of the major risk factors in
precipitating stroke.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
TM and NM were gift samples from Zydus Cadila, Ahmedabad, India.
Other chemicals were purchased: adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
naphthyl ethyl diamine (NED) (Sigma, St. Louis, USA); amino napthol
sulphonic acid, glutamate, aspartate, thiobarbituric acid (TBA),
dithiodinitrobenzene (DTNB), and dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH)
(Merck, Mumbai, India); sulphanilamide, sulphosalicylic acid (SSA), and
Tris–HCl (HiMedia, Mumbai, India); and phenazonium methosulphate
(PMS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) and
butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) (SISCO Research Laboratories,
Mumbai, India). Pre-coated HPTLC plates were purchased from
Merck, Mumbai, India and 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament was procured
from Ethicon®, Chennai, India. All other chemicals, reagents and
solvents were of analytical grade unless mentioned.
2.2. Animals
Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (each weighing 250–300 g and
6 months old) used in the study were supplied from central animal
house facilities, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research
(Coimbatore, India). The animals were housed in individual polypropylene cages in a well-ventilated room under an ambient temperature
of 25 ± 2 °C and 55% relative humidity (RH), with 12 h light/12 h
dark artiﬁcial photoperiod. They were provided with standard rat food
and puriﬁed water ad libitum. All the experimental animals were acclimatised for at least 7 days to laboratory conditions prior to experimentation. The guidelines from “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals” (Indian Council of Medical Research) were strictly followed
throughout the study. Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC),
PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Coimbatore, India
approved the ethical aspects of the study (proposal authorisation
number — 158/PO/BC/99/CPCSEA/168).
2.3. Experimental design and drug treatment
The rats were divided into ﬁve groups (each group, n = 9), the
sham-operated (SO) and ischemic reperfusion (IR) rats received 0.3%
carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), whereas the test animals received
TM 5 mg/kg (TM5), TM 10 mg/kg (TM10) or TM 5 mg/kg +
NM 5 mg/kg (TM5 + NM5) combination. The dose of TM & NM and
time of drug administration were based on earlier studies (Kasahara
et al., 2010; Babu and Ramanathan, 2011). The drugs were suspended
in 0.3% CMC and the treatment was started for all the groups 30 min
prior to the surgery and continued once daily in the morning hours
until the study was completed (Fig. 1).
2.4. Surgical procedure
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
(MCA) occlusion as described by Babu and Ramanathan (2009). Rats
were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p), and the physiological monitoring and physical monitoring of the rats were carried
out to assure that deep anaesthesia was maintained. The parameters
observed were abdominal respiration, non-retention of posture, and
sensory evaluation in the paws by application of mild pressure. The
right common carotid artery was exposed at the level of the external
and internal carotid artery bifurcation. Nylon monoﬁlament (4-0 size,
Ethicon®) was used and its tip was made round headed by exposing it
to ﬂame. The ﬁlament was coated with 0.01% poly-L-Lysine and inserted

into the external carotid artery and advanced to the internal carotid
artery for a length of about 20–21 mm until a slight resistance was
felt. On achieving occlusion, the ﬁlament was held in place with ligature
and the external incision was sutured temporarily. After 2 h of ischemia
the rats were anaesthetised, suture was opened, the ﬁlament was pulled
out and reperfusion of internal carotid artery was ensured visually.
Throughout the surgical procedure, body temperature was measured
by inserting a thermometric probe into the rectum of the rat and it
was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C using a thermostatically controlled
heating blanket. Animals were then kept in a cage with a heating
lamp, which maintained the cage temperature between 29 ± 1 °C for
another 1 h to counteract any possible hypothermic effect. In the SO
group, the external carotid artery was surgically prepared for insertion
of the ﬁlament, but the ﬁlament was not inserted.
2.5. Neurobehavioral paradigms
2.5.1. Neurological deﬁcit
Neurological deﬁcit was scored after 24 h of IR (Bederson et al.,
1986) and scoring pattern is as follows: 0 — no neurological deﬁcit,
1 — failure to extend left forepaw fully, 2 — circling behaviour, 3 —
falling to the left, 4 — no spontaneous walking with a depression,
and 5 — death.
2.5.2. Behavioural effect
Behavioural proﬁle in experimental groups was assessed by openﬁeld exploratory test on the seventh day of IR (Bronstein, 1972). Open
ﬁeld apparatus made of plywood, consisted of a ﬂoor (96 × 96 cm)
with high walls. The entire apparatus was painted black except for
6 mm thick white lines which divided the ﬂoor into 16 squares. Each
animal was placed at one corner of the apparatus up to 5 min, the parameters observed were ambulation (number of squares crossed),
total period of immobility (in seconds), rearing, grooming and number
of faecal pellets excreted. The locomotor activity (horizontal activity)
was measured using an actophotometer for 5 min to assess the muscular
activity (Boissier and Simon, 1965).
2.6. Neurobiochemical analysis
On the ninth day of IR, the rats were decapitated under mild anaesthesia and their brains were isolated from six experimental animals of
each group and microdissected into the cortex, striatum and hippocampus to analyse the drug effect on neurochemicals. In the MCAo model,
the most affected region was the midbrain. Hence the striatum and hippocampus regions were studied. The cortex being the higher centre; the
extent of neurodegeneration was also studied in this region (Babu and
Ramanathan, 2011). The brain samples were stored at − 80 °C until
the start of the analysis.

2.6.1. Glutamate and aspartate
Brain samples were homogenised in 0.1 N HCl in 80% ethanol (for
every 10 mg tissue/200 μl) and were transferred to polypropylene
tubes and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min at 25 °C. The supernatant
was then transferred into microcentrifuge tubes and used immediately
for neurotransmitter estimation by HPTLC (CAMAG — version 1.3.4,
USA) chromatographic condition: silica gel GF254 as stationary phase;
n-butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (65:15:25;v/v) as mobile phase;
applicator: Linomat V; scanner: CAMAG TLC scanner III; developing
chamber: twin trough glass chamber (20 × 10); developing mode:
ascending mode (multiple development); detection reagent:
0.2% ninhydrin in acetone; scanning wavelength: 486 nm; and
experimental condition: 25 ± 2 °C room temperature, 55–65% RH.
Standard solutions of L-glutamic acid (20–200 ng/spot) and aspartic
acid (10–80 ng/spot) were prepared for plotting the calibration
curve (Babu and Ramanathan, 2011).
2.6.2. ATP content
Aliquots of the homogenates were sonicated immediately in ice cold
perchloric acid (0.1 N) to inactivate ATPases. After centrifugation
(14,000 g, 4 °C, 5 min), supernatants containing ATP were neutralised
with 1 N NaOH and stored at −80 °C until analysis. ATP level in supernatants was quantiﬁed using a reverse-phase HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan).
RP-HPLC determination was performed on a reversed-phase Hypersil
C18 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) column (Elite, Dalian, China) attached
to two LC-10ATvp pumps (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with
UV–Vis detector. The mobile phase was 100 mM KH2PO4–K2HPO4 buffer
solution (pH 6.0), the ﬂow rate 1.2 ml/min, the column temperature
25 °C and the detection wavelength 254 nm (Zhan and Yang, 2006). A
reference solution of ATP was prepared according to dissolving
standards (Sigma, USA).
2.6.3. Na+K+ATPase measurement
Na+K+ATPase was assayed by taking 250 μl of Tris–HCl (184 mM;
pH 7.5) buffer followed by the addition of 50 μl of 600 mM NaCl, 50 μl
of 50 mM KCl, along with 50 μl of 1 mM sodium EDTA, and 50 μl of
80 mM ATP. The reaction mixture was pre-incubated at 37 °C for
10 min. 25 μl of 10% homogenate was added to the test alone and further
incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was immediately arrested by the
addition of 10% TCA. The resultant precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min. 50 μl of the supernatant, 1075 μl of distilled water, 125 μl of ammonium molybdate and 50 μl of 1-amino-2napthol-4-sulphonic acid were added and incubated for 10 min at
37 °C. The intensity of blue colour was read at 640 nm using spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) against a blank that contained all
the reagents minus the supernatant. Results were expressed in
nanomoles of inorganic phosphorus liberated/min/mg protein. Standard calibration was plotted using potassium dihydrogen phosphate

in the concentration range of 1.6–8 μg (Sovoboda and Mossinger,
1981; Yohtalou, 1975).
2.6.4. Glutamine synthetase (GS)
GS was assayed by taking 0.5 ml of Tris–HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0)
followed by the addition of 25 μl of 0.2 M glutamate, 25 μl of 100 mM
ammonia, along with 50 μl of 3 mM MgCl2 and 100 μl of 1 mM ATP.
The reaction mixture was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. 100 μl of
10% homogenate was added to the test alone and further incubated at
37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was immediately arrested by the addition
of 500 μl of 10% TCA. The control reaction rate was correspondingly
assessed by adding 100 μl of 10% homogenate only after arresting the reaction. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for
10 min. To 200 μl of the supernatant, 925 μl of distilled water, 125 μl
of ammonium molybdate, and 50 μl of 1-amino-2-napthol-4-sulphonic
acid were added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The intensity of blue
colour was read at 640 nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
Japan) against a blank that contained all the reagents without the supernatant. Results were expressed in nanomoles of inorganic phosphorus
liberated/min/mg of protein (Seiler et al., 1990). Standard calibration
was plotted using potassium dihydrogen phosphate in the concentration range of 1.6–8.0 μg.
2.6.5. Reduced glutathione (GSH)
GSH content was estimated by following the method of Jollow et al.
(1974). 0.25 ml of brain homogenate was added to an equal volume of
ice cold 5% TCA. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at
4000 rpm for 10 min. To 1 ml aliquot of supernatant, 0.25 ml of 0.2 M
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.5 ml of DTNB (0.6 mM in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) were added and mixed well. The absorbance was
read at 412 nm using spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
2.6.6. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs)
Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring the TBAR content
according to the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test described by Ohkawa
et al. (1979) with slight modiﬁcations. The incubation mixture consists
of 0.5 ml of aliquot, 0.2 ml of 8% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 1.5 ml of 0.9%
aqueous solution of thiobarbituric acid and double distilled water bath
for 30 min. After cooling, the red chromogen was extracted into 5 ml
of mixture of n-butanol and pyridine (15.1 v/v) centrifuged at
4000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of organic layer was taken at
532 nm (Shimadzu, Japan). 1,1,3,3-Tetra ethoxy propane was used as
an external standard in the concentration range of 80–240 nmol.
TBAR content was expressed in nmol/mg tissue.
2.6.7. Nitrates/nitrites
Nitric oxide (NO) was indirectly measured in the form of nitrates
and nitrites taking 0.2 ml of 10% homogenate followed by the addition
of 1.8 ml of saline and 0.4 ml of 35% sulphosalicylic acid for protein precipitation. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm
for 10 min. To 1 ml aliquot of supernatant, 2 ml Griess reagent (1 g of
sulphanilamide dissolved in small volume of water to which 2 ml of orthophosphoric acid and 100 mg of naphthyl ethyl diamine was added
and the volume was made up to 100 ml) was added. The mixture was
allowed to stand for 20 min under dark condition. The colour intensity
was read at 540 nm (Shimadzu, Japan). Standard calibration was plotted
using sodium nitrite in the concentration range 200–1000 ng (Green
et al., 1982).
2.7. Inﬂammatory mediator measurement by ELISA
The striatum and hippocampus regions of the brain were
reconstituted with buffer (0.1% BSA, 81 mM Na2HPO4, 19 mM NaH2PO4,
50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and the level of proinﬂammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 was assayed using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's

protocol (Quantikine & Invitrogen). All the estimations were carried out
in triplicate. The cytokine levels in the striatum and hippocampus tissues
alone were measured because they were nearer to the penumbra regions.
2.8. Protein estimation
Protein content in the different regions was estimated by Lowry et al.
(1951) method.
2.9. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
On the ninth day of IR, three animals per group were sacriﬁced following chloral hydrate anaesthesia. The brains were dissected out,
quickly ﬁxed in 10% formalin, and 5 μm thin sections were taken. The
sections were processed and stained with 0.1% cresyl violet stain. The
stained CA1 region of the hippocampus was observed under a binocular
light microscope (40 ×) and photographed to assess the extent of
neurodegeneration.
The synapse in the hippocampus region of ischemic and treated rat
brain samples was measured by immunohistochemistry using FLEX
monoclonal mouse anti-synaptophysin clone SY38 antibody (Dako,
Denmark). The staining protocol was followed as per the protocol instruction given by the manufacturer. The active synapse was evaluated
under the microscope (40×).
2.9.1. Assessment procedure
Three sections of the brain were stained and every brain tissue was
analysed in three different ﬁelds. Visual examination and grading of
brain ischemic injury in the sample regions were carried out. The histopathological changes observed were graded as below:
0–10% = 1 (no morphological signs of damage and very few dark
stained cells),
11–30% = 2 (meagre eosinophillic or dark neurons),
31–50% = 3 (few numbers of dark stained cell bodies with shrunken
cells),
51–70% = 4 (severe lesions with dark stained degenerative neurons,
shrunken cell bodies, with many leukocyte inﬁltrate),
71–100% = 5 (almost all cells in appearance of necrosis).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SE. Mean differences between the
groups in behavioural parameters and cytokine levels in the brain
were analysed by one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett multiple comparison test. The statistical signiﬁcance in neurochemical and biochemical changes was analysed by two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
test to compare the treatment effect across the regions and Dunnett
test within the region using GraphPad Prism, 4.03 (San Diego, US).
Neurological scores were analysed by Mann–Whitney U test. Probability
levels less than 0.05 were ﬁxed as the criterion for statistical
signiﬁcance.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of TM and its combination with NM on behavioural paradigms
3.1.1. Neurological deﬁcit
The effect of TM and NM on neurological deﬁcit in MCAo rats is
shown in Fig. 2. Induction of ischemia followed by reperfusion resulted
in circular behaviour, spontaneous depression, and loss of muscle coordination in vehicle treated MCAo rats (p b 0.001) in comparison to
SO rats. Treatment of TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) (p b 0.001) and TM + NM
(p b 0.001) combination attenuated the neurological deﬁcit observed
with ischemic rats. In comparison to TM5, signiﬁcant improvement in
the neurological score was observed with combination treatment.

A. Justin et al. / Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior 122 (2014) 61–73

However TM10 effect was comparable to the combination of TM5 with
NM5 effect.
3.1.2. Behavioural effects
The behavioural effect of TM and its combination with NM in
ischemic rats are represented in Table 1. After 7 days of IR, in the open
ﬁeld behaviour, the ischemic rats exhibited, decreased ambulatory
(F(4,29) = 6.54; p b 0.01) and grooming behaviour (F(4,29) = 3.16;
p b0.05) along with increased immobility period (F(4,29) = 12.06;
p b0.01) and increased faecal pellet excretion (F(4,29) = 2.63; p b 0.05)
in comparison to SO rats. The altered behaviour in ischemic state was signiﬁcantly reversed with TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and combination treatment.
In comparison to TM, the combination treatment did not differ signiﬁcantly in the open ﬁeld behaviour in ischemic rats.
In actophotometer, ischemic rats exhibited, decreased locomotor
activity (F(4,29) = 14.73; p b 0.001) in comparison to SO rats which
denotes retarded motor co-ordination. TM treatment (5 & 10 mg/kg)
(p b 0.001) and combination with NM (p b 0.001) signiﬁcantly improved the motor activity in comparison to ischemic vehicle treated
rats. Combined treatment of TM with NM produced synergistic effect
in comparison to per se effect of TM5. TM10 effect was found to be similar to that of combination treatment (Fig. 3).
3.2. Effect of TM and its combination with NM on excitatory
neurotransmitters
TM and NM effects on brain excitatory neurotransmitters are
depicted in Table 2. Induction of cerebral ischemia increased the
glutamate (F(2,75) = 8.86; p b 0.001) and aspartate (F(2,75) = 81.40;
p b0.001) levels in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions. Treatment with TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination with NM signiﬁcantly reduced the glutamate (F(4,75) = 28.44; p b 0.05) and aspartate
(F(4,75) = 48.02; p b 0.001) levels in the above brain regions in comparison to ischemic vehicle treated rats. The interaction effect (region vs
treatment) did not show signiﬁcant (F(8,75) = 0.4297; p N 0.05) effect.
Similarly aspartate did not show any signiﬁcant interaction (F(8,75) =
1.107; p N 0.05) between treatments and regions studied. Synergistic
effect was observed with combination therapy in glutamate reduction
in the striatum and hippocampus regions. Similarly aspartate level
was reduced signiﬁcantly in the cortex and striatum regions with combination therapy in comparison to TM5 treated group. However in comparison to TM10 treatment, the combination therapy did not differ
signiﬁcantly in the reduction of both neurotransmitters. The aspartate

higher than the striatum and cortex regions indicates basal value variation between the regions.
3.3. Effect of TM and its combination with NM on neurobiochemical levels
3.3.1. ATP content
Induction of ischemia depleted the ATP levels signiﬁcantly (F(2,75) =
4.876; p b 0.05) in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions in
comparison to SO rats which indicates energy depletion after reperfusion
neuronal injury. The ATP level was signiﬁcantly restored in the above regions with TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination treatment with NM
(F(4,75) = 212.1; p b 0.001). There is no signiﬁcant interaction between
region and treatment (F(8,75) = 1.299; p N 0.05) observed. In comparison
to TM5, the ischemic rats that received combination therapy have shown
signiﬁcant increase in the ATP level in all the brain regions. In the cortex, a
signiﬁcant increase in the ATP was observed with combination treatment
in comparison to TM10 treatment. Other regions of ATP level, with combination therapy, were at par with TM10 treatment. Among the regions
studied in comparison to the hippocampus ATP level the striatum ATP
level was signiﬁcantly elevated with TM5 treatment (Table 2).
3.3.2. Na+K+ATPase
The effect of TM and its combination on Na+K+ATPase level in ischemic and treatment groups are shown in Table 3. The induction of
cerebral ischemia resulted in reduced Na+K+ATPase level in the cortex,
striatum and hippocampus regions in comparison to SO group and
all the regions behaved similarly in this parameter (F(2,75) = 2.524;
p N 0.05). Treatment of TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination
with NM signiﬁcantly elevated (F (4,75) = 155.7; p b 0.001) the
Na+K+ATPase level in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions of
ischemic brain. The interaction study has shown signiﬁcant (F(8,75) =
6.385; p b 0.001) effect between the treatment and regions. In control
rats the striatum enzyme level was found to be signiﬁcantly lower
and higher in comparison to the hippocampus and cortical regions
(p b 0.001) respectively. Among the regions studied in comparison
to the striatum, the hippocampus and cortex Na+K+ATPase levels
were signiﬁcantly elevated with TM5 treatment. A signiﬁcant increase in the Na +K + ATPase level in all the regions was observed
with combination therapy in comparison to TM5 treatment. In comparison to TM10 treated rats, signiﬁcant increase in the striatum
Na + K +ATPase level was observed in ischemic rats that received
combination therapy.
3.3.3. Glutamine synthetase activity
Occlusion of middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion signiﬁcantly increased the GS activity (F(2,75) = 45.44; p b 0.001) in the cortex,
striatum and hippocampus regions. Treatment of TM (5 & 10 mg/kg)
and its combination signiﬁcantly decreased (F(4,75) = 259.4; p b 0.001)
the GS activity in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus regions of ischemic brain. Combination therapy has shown synergistic effect in comparison to TM5 & TM10 treatments as indicated by further reduction in the GS
level (Table 3). GS level in different regions and its interaction with
treatment exhibited signiﬁcance (F(8,75) = 3.617; p b 0.01). Interestingly
ischemic induction signiﬁcantly increased the striatum GS level in comparison to the hippocampus and cortex. In SO rats in comparison to the
cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions GS level was found to be significantly increased. The striatum and hippocampus GS levels remained the
same.
3.3.4. Reduced glutathione (GSH)
The effect of TM and its combination with NM on GSH level are represented in Table 4. A signiﬁcant depletion in the GSH level was noted in
the cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions of vehicle treated ischemic rats in comparison to SO rats. The group analysis of different regions with respect to GSH level has shown insigniﬁcance (F(2,75) =
1.088; p N 0.05). The interaction study (region vs treatment) did

not differ signiﬁcantly (F(8,75) = 0.2394; p N 0.05) with GSH level. The depleted GSH level was signiﬁcantly restored in the cortex, striatum and
hippocampus regions with TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination therapy with NM in comparison to IR rats (F(4,75) = 30.41; p b 0.001). In
comparison with TM5, combination therapy signiﬁcantly increased the
GSH levels in all the brain regions tested. Further the glutathione level
with combination therapy was found to be equal to SO rats.
3.3.5. Lipid peroxidation assay
The circulating lipid peroxide levels were signiﬁcantly elevated
(F(2,75) = 13.50; p b 0.001) in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus
regions in IR group. TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination treatment
signiﬁcantly attenuated the lipid peroxide level (F (4,75) = 139.2;
p b0.001) in all the brain regions of ischemic rats. The interaction study
(treatment vs region) has shown signiﬁcant effects (F(8,75) = 4.021;
p b 0.001), and the results indicate that the induction of IR in rats
elevated the TBAR levels differently in the regions studied. In all
the regions, TBAR level was found to be signiﬁcantly different in vehicle treated IR rats. Whereas in TM5 group, the striatum TBAR level
was found to be signiﬁcantly (p b 0.05) increased in comparison to
the cortex. Combination therapy signiﬁcantly reduced the lipid peroxide level in all the brain regions in comparison to TM5 treated
rats. The TM10 and combination therapy treated rats behaved similarly in this parameter (Table 4).
3.3.6. NO assay
The occlusion of middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion resulted in elevated NO level (F(2,75) = 12.99; p b 0.001) in the cortex,
striatum and hippocampus regions in ischemic rats and the data are
represented in Table 4. The interaction (F(8,75) = 3.098; p b 0.01) between treatment and region that had signiﬁcant effect indicates correlation between regions and treatment. The striatum NO level in IR group

was signiﬁcantly higher than (p b 0.001) the hippocampus and cortex.
Treatment of TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination attenuated the
NO levels (F(4,75) = 162.6; p b 0.001) in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus regions in comparison to vehicle treated ischemic rats. In comparison to TM5 treatment, combination therapy exhibited synergistic
effect as evident by further reduction in NO levels. The TM10 and combination therapy treated rats exhibited similar NO level in all the brain
regions.
4. Effect of TM and its combination with NM on
inﬂammatory mediators
The effect of TM and its combination on anti-inﬂammatory and
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine levels are presented in Table 5. Induction
of cerebral ischemia through middle cerebral artery occlusion elevated the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the striatum IL-1β
(F (4,25) =81.27; p b 0.01), IL-6 (F(4,25) = 565.3; p b 0.001) and
TNF-α (F (4,25) =167.9; p b 0.05) and in the hippocampus IL-1β
(F (4,25) = 121.6; p b0.05), IL-6 (F(4,25) = 634.2; p b 0.001) and
TNF-α (F(4,25) = 245.7; p b0.01) in comparison to SO rats. The antiinﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 level that was found to be decreased
in the striatum (F(4,25) = 709.6; p b 0.05) and hippocampus (F(4,25) =
534; p b 0.05) in the ischemic state indicates activation of inﬂammatory response after 9 days of ischemic induction. Treatment of
TM (5 & 10 mg/kg) and its combination with NM signiﬁcantly decreased the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine levels and elevated the
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the striatum and hippocampus
regions in comparison to ischemic vehicle rats. Interestingly, IL-10
level was found to be elevated above the normal value in all the treatment groups in comparison to SO rats.
In comparison to TM5 and TM10 treatments, the combination
therapy further signiﬁcantly reduced the IL-1β level in the striatum
and hippocampus regions. Similarly, in the striatum, the IL-6 level was
signiﬁcantly decreased with combination therapy in comparison to
TM5 and TM10 treated rats. In the hippocampus, IL-6 level was signiﬁcantly decreased in comparison to TM5 treatment and not with TM10.
TNF-α level remained unaltered and was found to be the same between
the treatment groups in the striatum. Whereas in the hippocampus, signiﬁcant reduction in the TNF-α level was observed with combination
therapy in comparison to TM5 treated rats. The anti-inﬂammatory cytokine level in the hippocampus regions did not alter with the treatments.
In the striatum, IL-10 level was found to be decreased with combination
therapy in comparison to TM5 and TM10 treated groups.

regulation of glutamate level; hence the correlation between IL-1β
(Fig. 4A and C) and IL-6 (Fig. 5A and C) with glutamate level in the
striatum and hippocampus regions was made. The results indicate
signiﬁcant positive correlation between glutamate and IL-1β in both
the hippocampus (p b 0.01) and the striatum (p b 0.006). A signiﬁcant
positive correlation was observed with IL-6 and glutamate levels in the
striatum (p b 0.03) and not in the hippocampus (p b 0.07).

Similar to glutamate, NO also plays a major role in the induction of
inﬂammation. On analysis the results indicate positive correlation
between IL-1β level and NO level in the hippocampus (p b 0.01) and
striatum (p b 0.0079) (Fig. 4B and D). No signiﬁcant correlation was observed between IL-6 and NO in both the striatum and the hippocampus
(Fig. 5B and D).
5. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
5.1. Cresyl violet
The CA1 region of the hippocampus of ischemic and treatment
groups is given in Fig. 6(A–E). The present ﬁndings showed that induction of ischemia resulted in neuronal cell loss and disturbed structure
mediated degeneration. In SO rats, more viable normal morphological
neurons were seen. TM5, TM10 and its combination with NM have
exhibited better neuronal protection of CA1 structure as observed by
normal morphology of neurons including cell bodies in comparison
with SO.
5.2. Synaptophysin
The synapse integrity assessment using synaptophysin staining in ischemic and various treatment groups is given in Fig. 7(A–E). SO rats
have shown the presence of synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus region of the brain as observing the button shaped stained
area. Middle cerebral artery occluded rats have shown the loss of
synaptophysin expression which indicates decreased integrity of the
synaptic cleft and loss of neuronal activity. Treatments of TM5, TM10

and its combination with NM in ischemic rats have protected neuronal
cells as observed by the presence of synaptophysin protein uptake.
6. Discussion
In the present study, MCA occlusion, followed by reperfusion injury,
resulted in degeneration of the different brain regions as observed by
excess release of excitatory neurotransmitters, ATP depletion, and
behavioural alterations with neurodegeneration. Further, current
experimental ﬁndings have shown the role of inﬂammatory events in
ischemia as indicated by increased levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
like TNF-α and IL-1β, IL-6 and decreased levels of anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine IL-10 in the striatum and hippocampus regions of ischemic
rats. These observations indicate successful induction of cerebral ischemia in rats (Ramanathan et al., 2012). During cerebral ischemia,
neurons are exposed to hypoxia, reduced mitochondrial function, increased intracellular cytosolic calcium level (Ca2+), excitatory amino
acids (EAAs), and toxic free-radicals (Siesjo, 1992a, 1992b). TM and
the combination of TM with calcium channel blocker NM produced synergistic effect as observed by decreased neurological score, cytokine
level, and biochemical including EAA. These results indicate the beneﬁcial effect of combination therapy. The TM neuroprotective effect might
be attributed to its AT1 blockade mediated or PPAR-γ agonist action
(Washida et al., 2010; Kasahara et al., 2010). TM has been reported to
have higher afﬁnity to AT1 receptor among the angiotensin receptor
blockers (Kakuta et al., 2005). Reports have also shown that AT1 receptor mediated angiotensin II response includes induction of inﬂammation and production of reactive oxygen species resulting in cell
destruction and apoptosis during ischemic condition (Wilms et al.,

2005). Hence the neuroprotective effect of TM might be receptor mediated. In earlier studies NM and NMDA antagonist memantine have
exhibited neuroprotective effect by ameliorating excitotoxicity in
the neurons (Babu and Ramanathan, 2009, 2011) which supports our
present ﬁndings.
The anxiogenic behaviour observed with IR rats could be due to the
alteration in neurobiochemicals like adrenaline, serotonin, GABA and
EAA levels (Babu and Ramanathan, 2009). In the present study, elevated
glutamate level in the ischemic brain was observed, which in turn may
be associated with anxiogenic behaviour of the rats (Swanson et al.,
2005). In the ischemic condition, elevated glutamate level would have
caused the loss of motor activity and exploratory behaviour. TM and
its combination with NM reversed the EAA elevation in IR and this
could be attributed to the behavioural changes observed in the IR rats.

Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) released during ischemic phase in the neuronal cells exhibit various effects on neurons,
microglia, and astrocytes (Minami et al., 2006) leading to inﬂammation
and reduced glutamate clearance in the extracellular space due to impaired glutamate transporters activity (Tilleux and Hermans, 2007).
To verify this, the correlation studies between cytokine levels and glutamate content were carried out in different brain regions. Interestingly,
TM and its combination with NM predominantly attenuated the proinﬂammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β & IL-6) release, proportionately
the glutamate content too. This effect would have been due to enhanced
synaptic clearance of EAA with its speciﬁc transporters preventing
neurodegeneration (Zadori et al., 2012). This was evidenced through
positive correlation between the cytokine and glutamate levels especially in the striatum and hippocampus regions. Reports indicate that

the expression and function of GLT-1 were suppressed in primary astrocytes after in vitro exposure to the IL-1β and TNF-α (Szymocha et al.,
2000; Wang et al., 2003; Korn et al., 2005). TNF-α stimulated extensive
microglial glutamate release in an autocrine manner by up regulating
glutaminase to cause excitotoxicity (Takeuchi et al., 2006). Moreover,
production of IL-1β during inﬂammation exerts clinically signiﬁcant
loss of the main astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1 leading to
excitotoxicity damage of spinal motor neurons (Prow and Irani, 2008).
This experimental evidence has shown that the anti-inﬂammatory property of TM would have also contributed the neuroprotective effect
through attenuating IL-6 induced excitotoxicity in neurons through
NMDA receptor activation (Qiu et al., 1998). Further TM neuroprotection

also contributed through increased release of anti-inﬂammatory cytokine
IL-10 which prevents the glutamate-mediated induction of caspase-3 as
well as NF-kB DNA binding activity, thereby reducing the neuronal degeneration after CNS injury (Bachis et al., 2001). In the present study,
the NM produced synergism in controlling cytokine levels with the combination of TM has further indicated that NM might have produced antiinﬂammatory activity through controlling the cytokine release (Zhang
et al., 2012; Sanz et al., 2012; Zhicong et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009). Further,
the drugs have been administered before and after IR and hence the drug
effect was present throughout the experimental protocol. In this condition, the initial release of Ca2+ ion effect during the IR phase would
have been controlled in NM treated rats. This might be one of the reasons

for better efﬁcacy of TM and NM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
ﬁrst to report the effect of TM with NM combination in cerebral ischemic
model.
The released EAA gets transported across the cell membrane for
the synthesis of glutamine by the enzyme GS. The elevated GS levels
along with EAA were signiﬁcantly attenuated with TM and its combination treatment with NM. This effect was also reﬂected with
Na+K+ATPase enzyme levels, the major enzyme responsible for active transport of ions across the cell membrane. Also GSH restoration by test groups has shown better effect denoting effective
utilisation of glutamate for GSH synthesis which is regulated by
proper glutamate uptake of astrocytes and glutamate synthetase.
The released glutathione acts as an antioxidant and protects the
cell from radical mediated cell injury. The radical release was observed due to decreased energy utilisation of mitochondrial hypoxic
status. In this condition, cells will undergo necrosis rather than apoptosis, resulting in more inﬂammatory mediator response. NO, a
major free radical, has been widely reported during ischemia. The
initial phase of release from eNOS is helpful in vasodilation and
can control inﬂammation. The NO release through iNOS can
precipitate inﬂammation. In the current study positive correlation
between cytokine levels and NO was observed in the striatum only,
which indicates that the penumbra region was most susceptible
and the release of IL-1β and IL-6 denotes inﬂammation after ischemia relating iNOS.
NM & TM treated rats have shown better ATP levels than TM5 in
the cortex. Similarly in other regions, the trend was observed. The
mechanism of action of NM might be carried out through blockade
of mitochondrial Ca2 + channels; thereby reducing the Ca2 + overload mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, which helps the ATP
level restoration in ischemia. Also impairment of mitochondrial
dysfunction by NM will retard the free radical release during ischemia and might protect the Na + K + ATPase degradation because
Na+K+ATPase is also very susceptible to free radical injury. Reports
also implicate that lipid peroxidation induced Na + K + ATPase enzyme inactivation by oxidation of one of the essential amino acid
residues in the active site of the enzyme (Nagafuji et al., 1992;
Arkhipenko et al., 1985).
The neuroprotective activity of TM and its combination with NM was
further supported by intact CA1 region in the drug treated brain samples
after ischemic induction using cresyl violet staining. In immunohistochemistry studies, the loss of synaptophysin, a synapse protein
regulating the synaptic neurotransmission, generally results in neuroinﬂammation as well as excitotoxicity insults and reduces synaptic markers
such as synaptophysin in rat brain (Rao et al., 2012). In earlier studies it
has been demonstrated that AT1 receptor antagonist prevents the AT1 signalling mediated synaptophysin degradation and neuronal dysfunction in
the retina of the diabetic mice (Kurihara et al., 2008) which further suggests that TM effect would have been mediated through AT1 receptor
blocking activity.
Hence, it could be concluded that AT1 receptor blockers in the brain
will have neuroprotective activity through attenuating cytokine
release. On the other hand, NM synergism on TM neuroprotective
effects would be affected through acting on cytokine attenuation,
energy level restoration, along with prevention of Ca2 + dependent
glutamate toxicity in neurons. Cytokine and glutamate levels exhibit
positive correlation and hence attenuation of neuroinﬂammation
can give edge in the treatment of ischemic disorder. The advantage
of TM therapy in ischemic state can be explored clinically due to its
dual action on hypertension.
