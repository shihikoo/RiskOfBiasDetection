Background: Acetylpuerarin (AP), because of its lower water solubility, shows poor absorption
that hinders its therapeutic application. Thus, the aim of this study was to prepare nanoemulsions
for AP, enhance its oral bioavailability, and thus improve the therapeutic effect.
Methods: The nanoemulsions stabilized by D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate
(TPGS) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization and characterized in terms of particle
size, drug loading, morphology, and in vitro drug release. A lipid digestion model was used
to predict in vivo drug solubilization in the gastrointestinal environment. The pharmacokinetics of AP formulations were performed in rats; meanwhile, a chylomicron flow-blocking rat
model was used to evaluate the lymphatic drug transport. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of
AP nanoemulsions on the model of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion for brain injury were
also assessed.
Results: The nanoemulsions with a droplet size of 150  nm were well stabilized by TPGS
and showed a high loading capacity for AP. In the digestion model, the distribution of AP in
aqueous phase/pellet phase was about 90%/10% for nanoemulsions and 5%/95% for oil solution, indicating that the drug encapsulated in nanoemulsions would present in solubilized form
after transportation into the gastrointestinal tract, whereas drug precipitation would occur as
the oil solution was orally administered. The area under the curve value of AP nanoemulsions
was 5.76±0.56 μg⋅hour⋅mL-1, or was about 2.6 and 1.7 times as great as that of suspension
and oil solution, respectively, indicating enhanced drug absorption and thus achieving a better neuroprotection effect on cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury. The values of peak plasma
concentration and area under the curve from the blocking model were significantly less than
those of the control model, suggesting that the lymphatic transport performed a very important
role in absorption enhancement.
Conclusion: Enhanced oral bioavailability in nanoemulsions was achieved via the mechanism of
the maintenance of drug solubilization in the gastrointestinal tract and the enhancement of lymphatic
transport, which resulted in therapeutic improvement of cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury.
Keywords: absorption, nanoemulsions, TPGS, lipid digestion, lymphatic transport, chylomicron

At this time, cardiovascular diseases are among the top health problems of the ­Chinese
people. A fifth of adults are suffering from the disease, and both morbidity and mortality remain at a high level.1 Of the subtypes, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, which
accounts for 80% of all cases, is a leading cause of disability and death in both rural
residents and urban citizens.1,2 Thus, the measures for treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease need to be further enforced without delay.

In an ischemic cerebrovascular disease, blood ­cannot
reach the brain, making the brain cells suffer from a
lack of the nutrients and oxygen that they normally
get.2 Thrombolytic and protective therapies of drug are two
major measures in the treatment of ischemic brain vascular
diseases at this time. Acetylpuerarin (AP; Figure 1) is one
of the effective drugs that can improve blood circulation,
treat coronary heart disease and arrhythmia, and decrease
myocardial oxygen consumption in both animals and human
patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.3,4 Our previous reports indicate that AP could exert protective effects
against brain ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing the
damage of oxygen-free radicals, increasing the activity of
antioxidase, and inhibiting the cell apoptosis in an ischemia
area in vivo.2,5,6 Parenteral administration of AP produces significant neuroprotective effects on rats against focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury because the drug goes directly
into the systemic circulation and rapidly reaches the site of
action; moreover, the onset of action is quick. Nevertheless,
looking at the quality of life and need for follow-up therapy
after diagnosis of the disease, the oral route has gained a
major focus compared with the parenteral route.7 However,
as a result of its lower water solubility, the oral administration
of AP is limited by its lower bioavailability (only 5%–6%)
and the resultant poor therapeutic effects.8–11  Thus, a new
formulation that can enhance its solubility and oral absorption is highly desirable.
Lipid-based nanoemulsions are nonequilibrium, heterogeneous systems consisting of two immiscible phases in
which one phase is dispersed in the other phase as droplets
with a mean diameter of 1–1,000 nm.12,13 Oil-in-water nanoemulsion is a promising delivery system for the safe and
effective delivery of oral insoluble drugs with the potential
for application to human therapy by increasing the efficiency

of oral administration.13,14  The drug can be incorporated
into the oil droplets with high drug loading, enhancing its
oral bioavailability and stability; meanwhile, the increased
surface-to-volume ratio of nanoemulsions facilitates drug
transport across the cell membrane, achieving sustained and
targeted drug delivery.15 Moreover, the nanoemulsions are
easy to prepare and scale up, having great promise for being
industrialized and applied in the clinic.16,17
To stabilize the nanoemulsions, an emulsifier must
be involved to decrease the interface tension of oil droplets. D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000  succinate
(TPGS), which is formed by the esterification of vitamin
E succinate with polyethylene glycol, is a water-soluble
derivative of natural vitamin E, which has been used in
pharmaceutical formulations approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration.10,18  It possesses much higher emulsification effects than other emulsifiers such as Tween 80
(BASF Corporation, Florham Park, NJ, USA), Cremophor
EL (BASF Corporation, Florham Park, NJ, USA), and egg
lecithin;18 moreover, it can increase the membrane permeability of insoluble drugs including paclitaxel, docetaxel,
cisplatin, and probucol by inhibiting p-glycoprotein and
thereby improving oral absorption.19,20  It is believed that
TPGS is an ideal emulsifier for nanoemulsion-based oral
delivery systems for insoluble drugs.21
The present study develops and characterizes the TPGSstabilized nanoemulsions loaded with AP, evaluates in vitro
drug release and in vitro lipid digestion, assesses the oral
bioavailability and mechanism of enhanced absorption in
rats, and studies the therapeutic effects on cerebral ischemic
reperfusion injury in rats.

from the Laboratory Animal Center, Shandong University,
People’s Republic of China. Other reagents were of analytical
grade and used as received.

Preparation of AP nanoemulsions
and stability study
The AP nanoemulsions were prepared by high-pressure
homogenization.22,23 Briefly, the oil phase was prepared by dissolving 100 mg AP in ethyl linoleate (2 mL) under sonication
at room temperature; the aqueous phase was prepared by dispersing 0.48 g TPGS in distilled water (30 mL) under the same
conditions. The aqueous phase and oil phase were combined
and then mixed by high-shear homogenization at 10,000 rpm for
5 minutes, using a FSH-2A blender (Jintan Medical Instrument,
Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China) to form the coarse emulsions. Nanoemulsions were obtained by passing these coarse
emulsions through a high-pressure homogenization (Niro-Soavi,
S.p.A., Parma, Italy) for 30 cycles at 12,000 psi.
Reference formulations were also prepared in which
61 mg AP was dispersed in 19.9 mg 0.1% sodium carboxy­
methyl starch water solution or ethyl linoleate to prepare AP
suspension or oil solution.
Short-term stability of the optimized formulations
(100  mg AP, 2  mL ethyl linoleate, 0.48  g TPGS, 30  mL
water) for 30 days was maintained at room temperature by
assessing the particle size and drug loading.

Particle size determination
After diluting 100-fold with distilled water, the mean particle
size and polydispersity index (PI) of nanoemulsions were
determined by Zetasizer 3000  HS (Malvern Instruments,
Malvern, United Kingdom). Three parallel measurements
were performed for each sample.

Transmission electron microscope
The morphology of nanoemulsions was analyzed by an
H-7000 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan). After dilution (1/100) in water, the sample was
stained with 2% (weight/volume [w/v]) uranyl acetate for
5 ­minutes at 25°C and was then placed on copper film grids
and observed by transmission electron microscopy after drying for 10 minutes at 25°C.

In vitro drug release
The AP release from nanoemulsions and suspension was
determined using a dialysis method described by Doh
et al.24 Briefly, a 0.2 mL sample was added to a dialysis bag
(12,000–14,000 MW cutoff) that was incubated in 100 mL

release medium that contained 1% Tween 80  (w/v) to
maintain a sink condition. The experiment was performed
in a controlled temperature water bath with a shaking speed
of 100 rpm at 37°C. At predetermined time intervals, 1 mL
external medium was removed for analysis and replaced with
1 mL release medium. After being filtered through a 0.22 μm
cellulose acetate membrane, the concentration of AP was
determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography
method described in the section of “Analytical methods”.
Each sample was carried out in triplicate.

In vitro digestion
The digestion experiment was carried out at 37°C, as described
in previous reports.25–27 Briefly, 50 mg nanoemulsions or an
ethyl linoleate-containing drug was dispersed in 20 mg digestion medium containing a mixture of 50  mM tris-maleate
(pH, 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM calcium chloride,
5 mM sodium taurocholate, and 1.25 mM soy phosphatidylcholine. The reaction was initiated by dispersing 1 mL porcine
pancreatic lipase solution (4,000 tributyrin units/mL) into the
digestive system. A solution of sodium hydroxide (1M) was
added into the digestive system to maintain the pH at 7.5.25–27
At the end of the experiment, the lipolysis was terminated by
the addition of 1 mL lipase inhibitor (1 M 4-bromophenylboronic acid in methanol). Two milliliters of the postdigestion
mixtures were withdrawn and ultracentrifuged at 310,000 g for
30 minutes at 4°C (Optima L-80XP ultracentrifuge; ­Beckman
Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) to separate the mixtures into
both an aqueous phase, containing the drug solubilized in
micellar structures making up endogenous bile salts and
phospholipid and exogenous lipid digestion products, and
a pellet phase containing precipitated drug and insoluble
(calcium) soaps of fatty acid.28 The aqueous phase or pellet
phase was dissolved in 2 mL methanol and then centrifuged at
5,000 g for 5 minutes to remove the undissolved substances.
The drug in supernatant was measured by a high-performance
liquid chromatography method described in the section of
“Analytical methods”.

Pharmacokinetics and mechanism
of absorption in rats
The rats (200–250 g) used in the experiments received care
according to Shandong University Unit for ­Laboratory
­A nimal Medicine guidelines. The animal experiments
were conducted using protocols approved by the Shandong
­University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

containing 0.1% sodium carboxymethyl starch and oil solution of AP) were conducted in Wistar rats. Eighteen rats
fasted for 12 hours and were randomly divided into three
groups (six rats for each group). The AP formulations were
orally administered to rats in each group at an AP dose of
30 mg/kg. At predetermined points, a blood sample of 0.3 mL
was collected from jugular vein in heparinized tubes. Plasma
samples were separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at
3,000 g and stored at -20°C until analysis.
To evaluate the mechanism of enhanced absorption, a
chylomicron flow-blocking rat model was used.29,30 Twentyfour rats were divided into four groups (six rats in each
group), which were treated with either an intraperitoneal
injection of 3 mg/kg cycloheximide in saline (0.6 mg/mL) or
with an equal volume of saline 1 hour before the experiment.
One hour after the injection, the formulations of oil solution
and nanoemulsions were orally administered to the rats at an
AP dose of 30 mg/kg. The blood samples were collected as
described in the above paragraph.

Sample preparation
Fifty microliters plasma sample, 25 μL methanol-acetonitrile
solution (1:1, volume/volume [v/v]), and 150 μL an internal
standard solution (100  ng/mL of genistein in methanol)
were placed into a plastic tube and vortexed for 1 minute.
After being centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, 15 μL
of supernatant was injected for analysis, as described in the
section of “Analytical methods”.

Analytical methods
The drug concentration of AP in both the release and digestion
medium was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method (Agilent 1200; Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) described in our previous report with minor
modification.11 The separation was performed on an Eclipse
XDB C18 column (250×4.6 mm, 5 μm; Agilent Technologies)
at 25°C. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 0.1%
phosphoric acid solution and methanol (40:60, v/v). The flow
rate of the mobile phase was 0.7 mL/minute. The eluent was
detected by an ultraviolet detector at 250 nm.
AP would be metabolized to puerarin after oral administration; thus, the pharmacokinetic evaluation was based on
the quantification of puerarin in plasma.9,11  The drug concentration of puerarin in plasma samples was determined by
an ­liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectro­
metry system that included an Agilent 1100 system (consisting
of a binary pump with a vacuum degasser, a thermostated
­column compartment, and an autosampler) and a 4000QTRAP
­triple–quadrupole mass tandem spectrometer (AB Sciex

Instruments, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with an
electrospray ionization source for mass analysis and detection.
Analyst 1.3  software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) was used for data collection and analysis.
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed in positive
ion mode and set up in a multiple reactions monitoring
mode by monitoring ion transitions at m/z 417.2→297.2 for
puerarin and m/z 271.2→153.0  for the internal standard,
genistein. The conditions of the mass spectrum were set
as turbo ion spray temperature, 450°C; ion spray voltage,
5,000 V; declustering potential, 80 V; and collision energy,
34 V for puerarin and 39 V for genistein. Nitrogen served as
nebulizer gas, auxiliary gas, curtain gas, and collision gas.
Chromatographic separation was carried out on a
CAPCELL PAK C18 MG Ш column (150×2.0 mm, 5 μm;
Shiseido, Kanagawa, Japan) by isocratic elution at a flow rate
of 0.35 mL/minute. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture
of 5 mM ammonium formate/methanol (35:65, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid solution. The column temperature was
maintained at 35°C.

Pharmacodynamics in rats

Focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
and oral administration
The rats (280–320 g) were randomly divided into five groups
(eight rats for each group): the sham-operated (Sham) group
and groups treated with blank nanoemulsions without drug
loading, AP formulations (suspension, oil solution, and
nanoemulsions). The rats were orally administrated for
7  days before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
procedure and 0.5 hours before the onset of ischemia at an
AP dose of 30 mg/kg.
The model of brain ischemia–reperfusion injury was prepared by MCAO in rats. The MCAO rats were produced by
intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery with
a nylon monofilament, as described previously.31 Briefly, the
rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate at a dose of
350  mg/kg. After separating the external carotid artery and
internal carotid artery, a nylon monofilament was introduced into
the external carotid artery lumen and advanced into the internal
carotid artery until resistance was encountered. After 1.5 hours
of ischemia, the reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the
nylon monofilament. In the Sham group, animals were prepared
in the same procedure with the exception of the insertion of the
nylon suture into the left internal carotid artery.

Neurologic deficit score
The neurological deficit score of each rat was assessed at
24 hours after reperfusion. The rats were scored on a 5-point

Infarct volume
To calculate the infarct volume (percentage), the separated
brain tissues were cut into 2 mm thick coronal sections that
were then incubated in the dark at 37°C for 30 minutes in
phosphate-buffered saline (pH, 7.4) containing 2% 2,3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and photographed by a digital
camera. The unstained areas that appeared pale were defined
as infarct regions, whereas the normal regions appeared
red. The area of infarct regions and each hemisphere were
measured by a blinded observer using digital imaging (Digital Camera, Olympus MDF-382E; Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) and morphological image-analysis system
(JD-801, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China). Infarction
volume was calculated according to the following formula
and expressed as the percentage of infarction in the ipsilateral
hemisphere.

where V is the volume of fraction, Ai is the infarct area of
each slice, and h is the slice thickness.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining
The rats were perfused intracardially with ice-cold normal
saline and 4% paraformaldehyde after anesthesia. The separated
brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours at
4°C, placed in 70% ethanol for 24 hours at room temperature,
dehydrated, and finally embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and
eosin staining was carried out to observe the morphological
changes of injured neurons in the cerebral cortex.

Data analysis and statistics
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis based on statistical moment theory using
Drug And Statistics professional software version 2.0 (Anhui,
People’s Republic of China). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time of maximum concentration (Tmax) were
obtained directly from the plasma concentration–time plots.
The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of
variance followed by a least significant difference test using
SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Results
with P0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization
of AP nanoemulsions
AP could be easily solubilized in ethyl linoleate with a solubility of 50 mg/mL. The nanoemulsions were prepared with
a procedure of high-pressure homogenization, in which no
drug precipitation was observed and from which a yellowish
milk-like suspension was obtained. The particle size of the
nanoemulsion was about 150 nm, with a narrow size distribution (PI 0.3; Figure 2A). The size and morphology of
the droplets were further confirmed by transmission electron
microscope analysis, as shown in the representative image
of the AP nanoemulsion (Figure 2B), in which the droplets
with a size of 100–150 nm were spherical and uniform. There
was no significant change in particle size and encapsulation
efficiency after the nanoemulsions were stored for 30 days
at 25°C (Figure 2C); thus we determined that the nanoemulsions were stable during the storage period.
The influence of the amounts of TPGS (based on the oil
phase, weight/weight [w/w]) on the mean particle size and
PI of oil droplets is shown in Figure 3A. Both particle size
and PI values decreased as the amounts of TPGS increased
from 1% to 20%; however, the increase from 20% to 50%
produced no effect on the particle size. It was reported that
the droplet size decreased with an increase in the amounts of
emulsifier.32,33 The droplets were not covered completely at
a low concentration of emulsifier, leading to a coalescence
of droplets and thus producing large droplets. An increase
in emulsifier not only decreased the coalescence of droplets
but also made the emulsifier absorb onto the droplets more
rapidly, leading to decreasing the droplet size and improving
the size distribution. However, droplet size was not affected
by the emulsifier concentration when all the surface of droplets was covered completely.
To evaluate the drug-loading capacity of TPGS­stabilized nanoemulsions, the influence of the drug loading
(based on the oil phase, w/w) on the mean particle size and
PI of oil droplets was performed. As shown in Figure 3B,
the effects of drug loading on the particle size and PI of
droplets were negligible, as the amounts of drug ranged
from 0%–40%, indicating that drug loading would not affect
the stability of nanoemulsions. A similar report by Akkar
and Müller indicated that the incorporation of drug into the
droplets enhanced the dispersion of nanoemulsions and thus
resulted in decrease in droplet size.34  It was because the
presence of drug molecules in the surfactant layer led to a
further reduction in the interfacial tension of oil/water.22

In vitro drug release
The AP release from nanoemulsions and suspension is shown
in Figure 4. More than 90% of the drug was released from
the suspension within 2 hours as a result of the solubilization effects of the surfactant in release medium. In contrast,
the drug release from nanoemulsions was less than 20%
after 24 hours, indicating that the drug release was retarded
and a controlled release profile was achieved. Moreover,

For oral lipid-based formulations, the model of in vitro
lipid digestibility was a useful tool to predict in vivo drug
solubilization/precipitation patterns in the gastrointestinal
environment. As shown in Figure 5A, lipid digestion was rapid
for both droplets and oil solution, and digestion was completed
within the first 30 minutes. In contrast, the digestion rate of
droplets was lower than that of oil solution. It was because
the lipases must diffuse across the TPGS films before lipases
accessed to the droplet cores, retarding the lipid digestion.37
After ultracentrifugation, the digestion medium was
separated into an aqueous phase and a pellet phase; no poorly
dispersed oil phase was observed. As shown in Figure 5B, the
percentage of AP in the aqueous phase/pellet phase was about
90%/10% for nanoemulsions and 5%/95% for oil solution.
The drug containing in aqueous phase from nanoemulsions
was much more than that of oil solution. It thus indicated
that the drug encapsulated in nanoemulsions would present
in a solubilized form after being transported into the gastrointestinal tract, whereas drug precipitation would occur as
the oil solution was orally administered.38,39 It was ascribed
to the solubilization effects of mixed micelles present in the
digestion medium that consisted of exogenous TPGS, lipid
digestion products, and the endogenous surfactants (bile salts
and phospholipids).28,38 It was believed that the maintenance
of the drug solubilized form in the intestinal fluid made the
drug molecules diffuse easily across the unstirred water layer,
enhancing drug absorption.40

of puerarin were 0.73  μg⋅mL-1/1.83  hours for suspension
and 0.95  μg⋅mL-1/1.67  hours for oil solution. In contrast,
the values of Cmax/Tmax of puerarin in nanoemulsions were
2.11 μg⋅mL-1/1.33 hours, indicating that a more rapid drug
absorption with higher peak plasma concentration were
achieved. The area under the curve (AUC) value of puerarin
in nanoemulsions was 5.76±0.56 μg⋅h⋅mL-1, which was about
2.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively, as great as that of suspension
and oil solution, thereby indicating enhanced drug absorption.
It was also observed that the AUC value from oil solution
was significantly greater than that of suspension, because
the ethyl linoleate lipid could also improve the solubility
and absorption of the insoluble drugs.41
For oral administration, the drug was absorbed into the
systemic circulation via the intestinal lymphatic transport
and blood transport. For a lipid formulation, intestinal lymphatic transport played a very important role in the absorption enhancement of a lipophilic drug because the drug could
be delivered to the systemic circulation without first-passing
effect of liver.28,30 The chylomicron flow-blocking rat model
was an efficient tool for evaluating lymphatic absorption.
Thus, we further assessed the bioavailability of oil solution and nanoemulsions in such a model. The mean plasma

drug concentration–time profiles of AP in rats treated with
cycloheximide or saline (control) are shown in Figure 7.
Compared with the control model, a significant decrease
in Cmax from the blocking model was observed (P0.05);
moreover, a 14% Cmax decrease for oil solution and a 76%
Cmax decrease for nanoemulsions in AUC were observed.
For nanoemulsion formulation, the blood transport and
lymphatic absorption were simultaneously ascribed to the
drug delivery to systemic circulation, whereas the latter
was a determinant. The percentage of lymphatic absorption resulting from the oil phase of nanoemulsions was
about 46% (calculated by the ratio of AUC values of the
cycloheximide and control model). Thus, the percentage of
lymphatic absorption resulting from TPGS was 30%. That
percentage was obtained by the difference of percentage
(76%) decrease for the nanoemulsions AUC and percentage
(46%) lymphatic absorption of the oil phase. It might be
explained by the exogenous TPGS promoting chylomicron
synthesis and then enhancing lymphatic transport, improving
the drug absorption.42
The presence of molecular state of drug in the gastrointestinal tract was a prerequisite for absorption, and the in
vivo drug solubilization was well correlated with the drug
absorption.39 Thus, the drug absorption was greatly affected
by the drug solubilization/precipitation patterns that could
be predicted by the lipid digestion model.43 Compared with
the oil solution (Figure 5B), almost the entire drug in nanoemulsions was solubilized in the mixed micelles in the digestion medium, which was partly attributed to the enhanced
bioavailability.

deficit score were 39.05%±4.02% and 2.75±0.46  for the
group without drug treatment, respectively. In contrast, the
groups treated with AP formulations significantly reduced
the infarct volume and scores. Moreover, more significant
reduction from the group treated with nanoemulsions
was obtained compared with the other two formulations
(Figure 8B and C). It thus indicated that the nanoemulsion
formulation provided better neuroprotection against focal
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.
To further evaluate the neuroprotection of AP formulations, the histopathology change of cerebral cortex was
examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining. As shown
in Figure 9A and B, no histopathological abnormalities were
observed in Sham rats, whereas in groups treated with blank
nanoemulsions without AP loading, most neurons in the
infarct core appeared shrunken with eosinophilic cytoplasm
and a triangulated pyknotic nucleus. The infarct core was
surrounded with necrotic neurons that exhibited a pyknotic
shape and condensed nucleus in peri-infarct zone. In contrast, the number of necrotic neurons in brain tissue from
rats treated with AP formulations was markedly decreased,
and the infarction area was significantly reduced, indicating
that the ischemic injury was attenuated after AP treatment
(Figure 9C–E). Furthermore, a more significant reduction

International Journal of Nanomedicine 2014:9

in the number of necrotic and condensed neurons was
observed from the group treated with AP nanoemulsions compared with the group treated with AP suspension and oil solution.
It is thus suggested that AP nanoemulsions produce better
protective effects on ischemic reperfusion injury, which is
in line with the results of infarct volume and neurological
deficit score.
It was reported that AP provided protective effects on
cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury via its antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory properties.31 However, its clinical application was limited by its low water solubility.9,11 The formulation of AP nanoemulsions had better neuroprotection effects
on brain injury compared with the formulations of suspension
and oil solution, indicating a correlation between enhanced
bioavailability and improved therapeutic outcome.

Conclusion
The TPGS-stabilized nanoemulsions with a droplet size of
150 nm and high AP loading were prepared successfully.
Enhanced oral bioavailability in nanoemulsions was achieved
via the mechanism of the maintenance of drug solubilization
in the gastrointestinal tract and the enhancement of lymphatic
transport, which resulted in therapeutic improvement on
cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury.
