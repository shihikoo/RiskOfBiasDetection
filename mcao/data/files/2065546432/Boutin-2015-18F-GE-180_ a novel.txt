Abstract
Purpose Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in various
neuropathological conditions, and hence there is renewed
interest in the translocator protein (TSPO) as a biomarker of
microglial activation and macrophage infiltration in the brain.
This is reflected in the large amount of research conducted
seeking to replace the prototypical PET radiotracer 11C-RPK11195 with a TSPO ligand with higher performance. Here
we report the in vivo preclinical investigation of the novel
TSPO tracer 18F-GE-180 in a rat model of stroke.
Methods Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced in Wistar rats
by 60-min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO).
Brain damage was assessed 24 h after MCAO by T2 MRI.
Rats were scanned with 11C-R-PK11195 and 18F-GE-180 5 or
6 days after MCAO. Specificity of binding was confirmed by

injection of unlabelled R-PK11195 or GE-180 20 min after
injection of 18F-GE-180. In vivo data were confirmed by
ex vivo immunohistochemistry for microglial (CD11b) and
astrocytic biomarkers (GFAP).
Results 18F-GE-180 uptake was 24 % higher in the core of the
ischaemic lesion and 18 % lower in the contralateral healthy
tissue than that of 11C-R-PK11195 uptake (1.5±0.2-fold
higher signal to noise ratio). We confirmed this finding using
the simplified reference tissue model (BPND =3.5±0.4 and 2.4
±0.5 for 18F-GE-180 and 11C-R-PK11195, respectively, with
R1 = 1). Injection of unlabelled R-PK11195 or GE-180 20 min
after injection of 18F-GE-180 significantly displaced 18F-GE180 (69±5 % and 63±4 %, respectively). Specificity of the
binding was also confirmed by in vitro autoradiography, and
the location and presence of activated microglia and infiltrated
macrophages were confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
Conclusion The in vivo binding characteristics of 18F-GE-180
demonstrate a better signal to noise ratio than 11C-R-PK11195
due to both a better signal in the lesion and lower nonspecific
binding in healthy tissue. These results provide evidence that
18
F-GE-180 is a strong candidate to replace 11C-R-PK11195.

Introduction
Over recent decades, increasing evidence has supported the
role of neuroinflammation as an essential contributor in CNS
diseases, whether it is acute brain injury such as stroke [1, 2],
chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease [3–7], Parkinson’s disease [8–11] or primary inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis [12–14]. This has led
to increasing interest in visualizing neuroinflammation in a
noninvasive manner that would lead to a better understanding

504

of neuroinflammation, its time course and its role in brain
diseases. So far, the most established and best characterized
biomarker for in vivo imaging of neuroinflammation is the 18kDa translocator protein TSPO, formerly known as peripheral
benzodiazepine receptor [15]. Strictly speaking, TSPO overexpression reflects microglial cell activation and proliferation
[16] rather than neuroinflammation in its broader sense. The
characteristics of TSPO as a surrogate marker of neuroinflammation led to the development of 11C-R-PK11195 as a TSPO
PET ligand in the early 1980s [15, 17]. 11C-R-PK11195 has
the disadvantages of the short half-life of 11C, a relatively poor
signal to noise ratio due to high nonspecific binding (for review
see Chauveau et al. [15]) and a rather problematic radiochemistry, although this last point is poorly documented despite
being well known by the radiochemistry community. To compensate for the poor binding properties of 11C-R-PK11195,
advanced modelling techniques have been implemented to
extract as much information as possible from the PET images
when no anatomical reference tissue can be defined [18–20].
For these reasons and its long-lasting presence in the field of
clinical TSPO PET imaging, 11C-R-PK11195 is still the most
used TSPO radiotracer in clinical studies [15].
Over the last decade, the issues with 11C-R-PK11195 and
the increased interest in neuroinflammation have triggered a
renewed effort to develop improved TSPO PET tracers, and
numerous compounds have been developed during this period
[15, 21, 22]. Most of these tracers, such as 18F-FEDAA1106,
11
C-PBR28, 11C-DPA-713 and 18F-DPA-714, have a better
signal to noise ratio than 11C-R-PK11195 in PET imaging of
various animal models [15, 23]. However, some studies with
these tracers clearly indicate variable results among different
models and the need to perform direct comparisons of two
tracers (i.e. scanning the same animal or subject twice) [15,
23, 24]. More recently, these new tracers have been investigated in various clinical studies, some of which have yielded
different results depending on the tracer used [14, 25] or the
disease studied [25, 26].
Taken altogether, the preclinical and first clinical studies
mentioned above highlight the need for thorough evaluation of
these new tracers with the expectation that some of them will be
introduced at clinical level on a wider scale. Initial preclinical
evaluation should provide information about the potential of a
new TSPO PET tracer, but do not guarantee success in the clinic.
Ideally, clinical evaluation of the tracer should follow, comparing it with 11C-R-PK11195 in a disease for which microglial
activation is sufficiently described to prevent any bias.
We report here the in vivo evaluation of a new
tetrahydrocarbazole TSPO tracer, 18F-GE-180 (S-N,N-diethyl9-2-18F-fluoroethyl]-5-methoxy 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-4-carboxamide [27]), and its direct comparison (i.e. in
the same animals) with 11C-R-PK11195 in a rat model of
stroke. To put our study into context, we also compared our
data with those recently reported by Dickens et al. [28], who

Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging (2015) 42:503–511

compared the two tracers in a different strain of rats and in a
different (lipopolysaccharide-induced) model of neuroinflammation. We also provide novel information about the metabolism of 18F-GE-180.
Materials and methods
Induction of focal cerebral ischaemia in rats
Studies were conducted in ten male Wistar rats (Charles River,
Margate, UK). The animals weighed 357±44 g. The animals
were kept under a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food
and water. All procedures were carried out in accordance with
the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and the specific
project licence was approved by the UK Home Office. Focal
cerebral ischaemia was induced by 60-min transient occlusion
of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) by the insertion of a
monofilament (Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA) as previously described [23] (for full details see Supplementary material).
MRI
The primary outcome was infarct volume measured on MRI
24 h after transient MCAO. Animals were scanned using a
Magnex 7-T, horizontal-bore magnet (Agilent Technologies,
Oxford Industrial Park, Yarnton, UK) connected to a Bruker
Biospec Avance III console (Bruker Biospin Ltd., Coventry,
UK) with a transmit/receive 2.5 cm surface coil. Rectal temperature and respiration rate were monitored. Reperfusion of
the right MCA was assessed using a FLASH-TOF-2D sequence. A T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence based on
RARE was used to measure brain damage [29, 30] (details
of the sequences can be found in the Supplementary material).
Lesion volume was determined with Anatomist software
(http://brainvisa.info/), Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the infarcted tissue were delineated on the T2 MRI
scans based on the enhanced contrast of oedematous tissue
when compared with healthy tissue 24 h after MCAO.
PET and data acquisition
Rats were anaesthetized 5 to 6 days after MCAO by
isoflurane inhalation (induction 5 % and thereafter
2 – 2.5 %) in oxygen. As a control, five naive rats (no
MCAO) were scanned with 18F-GE-180. All compounds
were injected intravenously into a tail vein as a bolus. All
injected doses, amounts of tracer injected and specific
activities are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Dual 11C-R-PK11195/18F-GE-180 scans
Six animals were scanned sequentially with 11C-R-PK11195
and 18F-GE-180 within 24 h (four rats were scanned with 11C-

Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging (2015) 42:503–511

R-PK11195 first and then with 18F-GE-180 3 h to 6 h later, and
two rats were scanned with 18F-GE-180 first and then with
11
C-R-PK11195 the following day). 11C-R-PK11195 and 18FGE-180 were synthesized as described elsewhere [27, 31, 32].
Displacement study
To assess the specificity of 18F-GE-180 in vivo, a displacement study was performed by injecting an excess (1 mg/kg) of
either unlabelled R-PK11195 or GE-180 during the PET
acquisition 20 min after the injection of 18F-GE-180. Three
rats were scanned twice with 18F-GE-180 within 24 h, once
with administration of unlabelled R-PK11195 and once following administration of GE-180 as unlabelled ligand 20 min
after injection of 18F-GE-180.
Data acquisition
The scans were performed on a Siemens Inveon® PET/CT
scanner. A CT scan was performed prior to the PET acquisition to obtain the attenuation correction factors. The list mode
acquisition data files were histogrammed into 3D sinograms
and reconstructed using OSEM3D (details of the PET protocols can be found in the Supplementary material). Respiration
and temperature were monitored throughout using a pressuresensitive pad and rectal probe (BioVet; m2m Imaging, Cleveland, OH). Body temperature was maintained (37±0.7 °C) by
the use of a heating and fan module controlled by the rectal
probe via the interface controlled by the BioVet system.
At the end of the last PET scan, rats were quickly decapitated
and the brains were quickly removed and immediately frozen in
isopentane in dry ice. The brains were stored at −80 °C until cut
with a cryomicrotome into adjacent 20-μm thick coronal sections. Brain sections were then stored at −80 °C until used for
autoradiography or immunohistochemistry.
Image analysis
PET images were analysed using two sets of ROIs. The first
set of ROIs came from automatic segmentation of the PET
images using the local means analysis method [33] with
partial volume effect correction using the geometric transfer
matrix method and the ROIopt methods [23, 33–35]. Automatic segmentation of the volume had the advantage of delineating user-independent ROIs. For both tracers the following
five ROIs were automatically segmented and labelled as: (1)
core (ROI covering the core of the infarct in the MCAO
territory and/or with the highest uptake), (2) edge-1 (ROI
around the core ROI and/or with the second highest uptake),
(3) edge-2 (ROI around the core ROI and/or with the 3rd
highest uptake), (4) edge-3 (ROI around the core ROI and/or
with the 4th highest uptake), (5) contralateral ROI (ROI with

505

the lowest uptake), and (6) skull edges (ROI located on the
edge of the skull; this ROI was not included in the data
analysis). In control animals, two ROIs within the whole brain
were se gmen te d, a h ig her u ptake R OI nea r the
cerebroventricular zones and a lower uptake ROI corresponding to the rest of the brain (data not shown). The second set of
ROIs was obtained from the anatomical ROIs used for quantification of the infarct volume on the T2 images (as described
in the MRI section).
To coregister the T2 MRI and PET/CT images, a brain
mask was delineated on each individual T2 MRI and CT
image, and the resulting brain masks were then coregistered
using rigid registration with mutual information. All methods
were applied using the BrainVisa/Anatomist framework
(http://brainvisa.info/). The cerebellum and olfactory bulbs
were delineated based on the coregistered MRI images. 11CR-PK11195 and 18F-GE-180 uptake was quantified using
both the segmented and MRI-based ROIs.
Plasma and brain metabolite analysis
Male Wistar rats (200 to 250 g body weight) were anaesthetized using isoflurane in oxygen. 18F-GE-180 (20 MBq) was
administered intravenously by bolus injection into a tail vein
of each rat. The rats were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia. Immediately before they were killed, the rats were
further anaesthetized and then killed by cervical dislocation
at 10, 30 or 60 min after injection (three rats per time-point).
Blood and brain were immediately collected for processing
and HPLC analysis (full details of the methods are provided in
the Supplementary material).
Immunohistochemistry
In all the rats used in the PET study, astrogliosis and microglial
activation were checked by immunohistochemistry staining
for GFAP and CD11b, respectively (details of the method are
provided in the Supplementary material).
Autoradiography
18

F-GE-180 (240.3 GBq/μmol, 1 nM) autoradiography was
performed using 20-μm brain sections. Using adjacent sections, specific binding for TSPO was assessed by adding an
excess of unlabelled R-PK11195 or unlabelled GE-180
(20 μM). Sections were preincubated in Tris buffer (Trizma
Pre-set crystals, adjusted to pH 7.4 at 4 °C or room temperature, 50 mM, with 120 mM NaCl; Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) at 4 °C for 5 min, then incubated for 60 min in Tris
buffer at room temperature and then rinsed twice for 5 min
with unlabelled buffer, followed by a quick wash in unlabelled
distilled water and drying before exposure to a Phosphor-

506

Imager screen for 2 h. Autoradiographs were visualized using
AIDA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).
Statistical analysis
The paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare 11C-RPK11195 and 18F-GE-180 uptake values for each ROI and
to compare ROIs for each tracer using images summed from
40 to 60 min after injection. The unpaired Mann-Whitney test
was used to compare the 18F-GE-180 uptake values with and
without injection of unlabelled tracer on images summed from
40 to 60 min after injection. All statistical calculations were
performed with Statview 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). All data are expressed as means±SD.

animal was excluded from the study because of a very small
infarct observed on the T2 images. The average infarct volumes without this animal were 65.7±12.7 mm3 and 66.8±
63.0 mm3 for striatal and cortical infarcts, respectively, and
132.5±61.9 mm3 for the total infarct.
PET imaging

As assessed by MRI, all animals except one had infarcts
involving the whole striatum, and to some extent part of the
cortical areas, most often the piriform cortex (Fig. 1). One

As shown Fig. 2, the uptake of 18F-GE-180 was significantly
higher (+24 %) in the core of the infarct and significantly
lower (−18 %) in the contralateral ROI than the uptake of 11CR-PK11195, leading to a significant increase of 1.5±0.2-fold
in the core to contralateral ratio (Fig. 2d). 18F-GE-180 brain
uptake in normal animals (0.082±0.026 %) was not significantly different from that in the contralateral ROI of stroke
animals (0.104±0.016 %). Using ROIs drawn on the T2 MRI
images to quantify the PET images yielded the same results
(see Supplementary Fig. 1), although automatic PET segmentation allowed the detection of an intermediate level of TSPO
expression on the edges of the infarct core (Supplementary
Fig. 2), ROIs that could not be identified on anatomical MRI.
The simplified reference tissue model showed that the
binding potential (BPND) of 18F-GE-180 was significantly

higher than that of 11C-R-PK11195 in the infarct core (5.3±
1.2 vs. 2.8±0.7). However, R1 (tracer delivery ratio between
the chosen ROI and the reference ROI) values were >1 for
both tracers in the lesion core, suggesting faster delivery than
in the reference (healthy) tissue. To account for this, we
measured the BPND with the R1 value fixed at 1. This significantly reduced the BPND for both tracers but the difference
between the BPND for 18F-GE-180 and that for 11C-RPK11195 remained significant (3.5±0.4 vs. 2.4±0.5).
Injection of an excess of unlabelled ligand significantly
displaced 18F-GE-180 in the infarct (69 %±5 % and 63 %±
4 % of the uptake before injection of the unlabelled ligand for
R-PK11195 or GE-180, respectively; Fig. 3 and Table 1).

Injection of unlabelled ligands significantly reduced the mean
uptake values from 40 to 60 min in the striatal infarct and these
values were not significantly different from those in the contralateral ROIs (Table 1). Uptake values in the contralateral side
after injection of unlabelled R-PK11195 or GE-180 were not
affected by injection of unlabelled tracer (Table 1), confirming
that the contralateral tissue was devoid of specific binding, and
could therefore be used as the reference tissue for modelling.

presence of parent compound decreased with time, such that
21 % remained by 60 min after injection (Table 2).
Radiolabelled metabolite M1, accounted for 21 % of the total
activity in the plasma 10 min after injection, with the proportion increasing with time to 53 % by 60 min after injection.
Two other more minor metabolites were observed 10 and
30 min after injection of 18F-GE-180 increasing to 5 % and
21 % of total plasma activity by 60 min after injection. In
contrast, the metabolites observed in the plasma are not
formed in the CNS nor do they cross the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) to any significant degree. In the brain not less than
95 % of the radioactivity was attributable to the parent compound, even 60 min after injection (Table 2).
Immunohistochemistry and autoradiography
Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CD11bpositive cells (activated microglial cells and infiltrated macrophages) in the core of the lesions and GFAP-positive cells
(astrogliosis) on the edge of the core ischaemic lesions
(Fig. 4). TSPO binding was confirmed in vitro by autoradiography using 18F-GE-180 (1 nM) and the specificity of binding
was confirmed by displacement with excess of unlabelled RPK11195 or GE-180 (1 μM) (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Discussion
As we have recently demonstrated in animal models [23], and
even more so in human conditions in which high

interindividual variability in size and/or location of the infarct
is expected [36, 37], direct comparison of PET tracers in the
same subject by performing successive scans within 24 h is
the most robust way of comparing the performance of two
tracers such as 18F-GE-180 and 11C-R-PK11195.
In our study, 18F-GE-180 had a significantly higher uptake
in the infarct and importantly a lower uptake in healthy tissue,
leading to a significantly better infarct/contralateral ratio, than
11
C-R-PK11195. Interestingly, the facts that uptake values in
the contralateral ROI (0.108±0.018 %) were not significantly
different from those in control animals (0.082±0.026 %) and
that injection of an excess of unlabelled R-PK11195 or GE180 yielded identical values to those obtained without displacement (Table 1) demonstrates that the contralateral ROI
did not contain specific binding and could therefore be used as
a reference tissue. In the ischaemic striatum, the average
uptake values (40 – 60 min summed image) were not significantly different from the values in the contralateral ROI
(Table 1) following injection of an excess of unlabelled RPK11195 or GE-180, but the time–activity curve showed that
the uptake values were not identical to those observed in the
contralateral ROI either. This suggests that there was a higher
level of nonspecific binding in the infarct and/or that a small
fraction of the metabolites may have entered the brain through
the disrupted BBB.
Our metabolite study showed that 18F-GE-180 has blood
pharmacokinetics similar to those of other new TSPO tracers
such as 11C-DPA-713 or 18F-DPA-714, with 70 %, 40 % and
21 % of the parent compound still present at 10 min, 30 min
and 60 min after injection, respectively [38, 39]. Similar to
many of the new TSPO tracers, metabolites were barely

and nuclear staining with DAPI in the contralateral (left) and ipsilateral
(right) sides of the brain of a rat 6 days after MCAO. Scale bars: from top

to bottom, 200 μm, 100 μm and 50 μm. The inserts (top right) shows the
approximate location of the fields of view used for immunohistochemistry (white rectangles) on the MRI and [18F]GE-180 autoradiographic
images from the same animal

detectable in healthy brain, supporting the view that
quantification of TSPO using 18F-GE-180 reflects the
level of TSPO expression unbiased by nonspecific uptake of metabolites. We cannot, however, exclude the
possibility that some metabolites crossed the disrupted
BBB after stroke. This is supported by modelling the
data using the SRTM which showed R1 >1, indicating
faster tracer delivery in the infarct probably due to
BBB disruption after stroke that we have previously
demonstrated [23].
Regarding the potential effect of repeated administration of
a nontracer dose (1 mg/kg) of TSPO ligands, we did not
observe a systematic change in the animals in TSPO binding
6 days after MCAO (second scans) following administration
of cold ligand at 5 days after MCAO, which suggests that this
dose of cold ligand did not affect the expression of TSPO.
Assessing the potential effect of repeated administration of
unlabelled ligand at doses used for displacement studies
(1 – 5 mg/kg), similar to those used in therapy for example,
was outside the scope of the present work and would require
further characterization.
Our modelling data confirmed the raw uptake data and
showed 1.5±0.2-fold higher BP values for 18F-GE-180 than
for 11C-R-PK11195. The location and specificity of the

binding was also confirmed by in vitro autoradiography, and
coincided with an increased number of activated microglial
cells and infiltrated macrophages in the infarct, and an astrocytic scar around it as shown by the immunohistochemistry.
Overall, the results presented here are in good agreement
with those recently reported by Dickens et al. [28] who used a
different model of neuroinflammation, and support further use
of 18F-GE-180 in preclinical and clinical imaging of TSPO.
Although 11C-R-PK11195 is still widely used clinically and
preclinically [15, 21, 40], the present results are in line
with previous observations made by our group and others
with different tracers supporting the use of 18F-labelled
tracers because of their better signal to noise ratio and
also longer half-life allowing off-site use. It should be
noted, however, that both the study of Dickens et al.
[28] and ours uses models of strong and acute neuroinflammation. It would therefore be desirable to assess
second generation TSPO tracers, such as [18F]GE-180,
[ 18 F]DPA-714, [ 18 F]PBR111, [ 18 F]FEDAA1106 and
many others [15, 21], which have demonstrated better
signal to noise ratio than [11C]PK11195, using other types
of model (e.g. multiple sclerosis, transgenic model of
Alzheimer’s disease) inducing lower levels of inflammation that are more challenging to detect.

Conclusion
The use of successive scans with 11C-R-PK11195 and 18FGE-180 allowed us to truly compare the two tracers in the
same animals, hence avoiding potential bias due to interindividual variability frequently observed in models such as the
stroke model in rats. We were able to demonstrate that 18FGE-180 is a strong candidate for TSPO imaging with an
improved signal to noise ratio and lower nonspecific signal
when compared to 11C-R-PK11195.
