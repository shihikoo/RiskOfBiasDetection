Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) promotes ischemic stroke injury and has strong effects in vascular contraction and
vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Agents that reduce TXA2 production have potential for ameliorating neural
injury in ischemic stroke. Thromboxane synthetase (TXS) is essential for TXA2 production, and TXS inhibitors
have been developed as drugs for the prevention and treatment of stroke. However, ozagrel, a typical TXS
inhibitor currently in clinical use, must be delivered via intravenous injection (I.V.). N2, 4-(2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)
ethoxy)-3-methoxybenzoate, is a potential thromboxane synthetase (TXS) inhibitor, which is being developed as
an orally available formulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of N2 on focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury and related mechanisms. Neurological deﬁcits, a Y-maze test and infarct volume were measured to evaluate the effects of N2 post-treatment on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of N2 on U46619-induced rat aorta contraction was investigated ex vivo. Moreover, we investigated the protective effects of N2 on rat brain microvessel endothelial cells
(RBMECs) in hypoxia/deoxygenating (H/R) induced by Na2S2O4 in vitro. Cell viability and TXA2 biosynthesis were
measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 195 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays, respectively. The results showed that N2 treatment effectively improves performance in neurological deﬁcit and the Y-maze test and reduces the infarct volume in I/R rats. U46619-induced rat
aorta contraction was inhibited by N2 ex vivo. Furthermore, N2 incubation improved the morphology of RBMECs,
increased cell viability, and suppressed TXA2 production by inhibiting TXS during H/R damage.
In summary, this study demonstrated that N2 was neural protective in focal cerebral I/R injury, which might be
associated with the effects of N2 on endothelium protection and vascular contraction inhibition. In depth, the
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be the inﬂuence of N2 on TXA2 production targeting TXS.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide (Tu, 2010).
Focal cerebral ischemia occurs when an artery in the brain is blocked
(Bandera et al., 2006). Blocked brain blood ﬂow provokes consequent
energy failure, excessive extracellular glutamate release, and the
accumulation of intracellular Ca2+, resulting in the activation of Ca2+dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which contributes to the release of
arachidonic acid (AA) from membranes (Rink and Khanna, 2011).

Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a major product of AA metabolism
(Nakahata, 2008). It has been reported that TXA2 is involved in a diverse
range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including
cerebral thrombosis, ischemic heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and
diabetic disorders (Davi et al., 2012). TXA2 elicits strong effects in vascular contraction and endothelium dysfunction (Nakahata, 2008), further
impairs circulatory function and aggravates injury during ischemic stroke
(Matsuo et al., 1996). Prostacyclin (PGI2) is another AA metabolite, which
possesses opposing biological activity and shares the same precursor,
prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), as TXA2 (Bos et al., 2004). PGH2 is produced
by cyclooxygenase (COX) from AA. Then, TXA2 is produced by TXS, and
PGI2 is produced by prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) from PGH2 (Rink and
Khanna, 2011). The balance between TXA2 and PGI2 is the basis for homeostasis in the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular systems. There is enhanced TXA2 production and reduced PGI2 in patients with ischemic
stroke (Smith et al., 1980; Kim et al., 2010). Agents that affect TXA2 production often inﬂuence PGI2 production as well.

Thromboxane synthase (TXS) is essential for TXA2 biosynthesis.
Developing a TXS inhibitor is a promising strategy for protecting against
cerebral ischemic stroke (Kontogiorgis and Hadjipavlou-Litina, 2010).
Ozagrel is a conventional TXS inhibitor clinically effective for the
prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebral disease (An et al.,
2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Rink and Khanna, 2011), and it is administered
by intravenous (i.v.) injection. N2, 4-(2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethoxy)-3methoxybenzoate, was synthesized as a potential synthetic TXS inhibitor with a chemical structure similar to ozagrel, but it has been altered
to be orally available (Fig. 1). The aim of our long-term study was to investigate the application of N2 for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke, and more signiﬁcantly, to develop it as an orally
administered formulation for clinical use, which would improve patient
convenience and compliance.
In this study, we ﬁrst investigated the protective effects of N2 on
experimental focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and related mechanisms. The in vivo effects of N2 were compared with that of
clopidogrel, an oral anti-ischemic drug, and ozagrel ex vivo and in vitro.

2.2.2. Neurological deﬁcits
Neurological deﬁcit scores were assessed according to the method of
Longa (Longa et al., 1989) 13 days after MCAO. Brieﬂy, scoring was
performed as follows: 0 = no deﬁcits, 1 = contralateral forelimb ﬂexion
when tail is lifted, 2 = decreased resistance to lateral push on a smooth
surface, 3 = spontaneous circling movement in the contralateral
direction, 4 = no spontaneous movement.

2.2.3. Y-maze test
Short-term spatial learning and memory can be assessed by tests for
spontaneous alternation. We used the Y-maze test to quantify spontaneous alternations for drug treatment after ischemia. The Y-maze test
was performed after a neurological score assessment. The maze was a
closed 3-arm maze with equal angles between all arms. A bulb was set
in the distal end of each arm. In the test, two charged arms with the
bulb off were deﬁned as a “shocking area”, while the uncharged arm
with the bulb on was deﬁned as the “safe area”. Each rat was placed in
the maze and allowed to adapt for 3 min. A correct response was deﬁned as direct escaping to a “safe area” when a shock was randomly
begun. The learning score was the number of cumulated stimulations
before 9 continuous correct responses were achieved. 24 hours later, a
memory score, which was deﬁned as the number of right choices in
10 continuous shock was assessed.

N2, 4-(2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) ethoxy)-3-methoxybenzoate, was
kindly provided by Hefei Yigong Medicine Co., Ltd.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–280 g) (for rat cerebral ischemia
and aorta contraction), and days 6–8 Sprague-Dawley rats (for culturing
rat brainmicrovessel endothelial cells (RBMECs) were purchased from
the Jiangsu Province Laboratory Animal Center. Animals were cared
for in the Animal Center of China Pharmaceutical University at a temperature ranging between 23 and 25 °C with a 12 h light–dark cycle
and a relative humidity of 50%. Rats were housed in metabolic cages
with a supply of ﬁltered pathogen-free air with access to food and
water ad libitum. For rats used for cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
and aorta contraction experiments, there was a 3-day acclimation period prior to experiments. All experiments were in compliance with the
institutional guidelines of China Pharmaceutical University (Nanjing,
China).

2.2.4. Ischemic infarct evaluation
14 days after MCAO, animals were deeply anesthetized and killed by
cervical dislocation. The rat brains were quickly removed and chilled at
−20 °C for 10 min. The brains were then sectioned into 5 2 mm thick
coronal slices. Then, the brain sections were stained with 1% 2, 3, 5triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C in a water bath for
15 min and then photographed (Wang et al., 2007). TTC stains viable
brain tissue with a red color based on intact mitochondrial function,
whereas infarct tissue areas remain unstained (i.e., white). The infarct
area of each brain section was measured in a blinded manner using
image-analysis software (Image-Pro plus, USA). Infarct volumes were calculated by integration, and they were expressed as a percentage of the
volume of lesioned structures in the whole brain (Loh KP, etc).

2.2. In vivo ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)

2.3. In vitro rat aorta contraction

2.2.1. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery and treatment
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups
(n = 8): the sham-operation, vehicle (saline), 7.5 mg/kg clopidogrel,
15 mg/kg N2, 7.5 mg/kg N2, and 3.75 mg/kg N2 groups. Animals were
fasted but with a water supply the night before surgery. MCAO surgery
was performed to induce focal cerebral ischemia in rats (Fang et al.,
2013). Brieﬂy, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded using a
silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament inserted into the external carotid
artery. Reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the ﬁlament 2 h
after MCAO surgery. The initial administration was conducted orally 2
h after reperfusion with double dosage and then once daily for the subsequent 14 days.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacriﬁced under ether anesthesia,
and their thoracic aortas were removed. Adherent connective tissues
were cleaned, and the thoracic aorta was cut into rings of 3–4 mm in
length. The rings were suspended in water-jacketed organ baths
(37 °C) with 10 ml Krebs–Heinseleit solution (118 mM NaCl, 4.75 mM
KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM
NaHCO3 and 11 mM D-glucose) and incubated with a 95% O2 and 5%
CO2 mixture (Zhu et al., 2013). The isometric tension of the aortic
rings was recorded with a force–displacement transducer (Chengdu
Technology &Market Co., Ltd. Chengdu, China). The tissues were
equilibrated for 60 min at 1 g optimum resting force. The viability of
arterial rings was tested by KCl (60 mM)-induced contraction. Then,
the solution was changed to fresh Krebs–Heinseleit solution until the
tension returned to baseline value.
Five groups were set as follows: control (saline), ozagrel (10−5 M) and
N2 (3 × 10−5 M, 10−5 M, 3 × 10−6 M). After viability of contraction test,
aortic rings were incubated with N2 (3 × 10−5 M, 10−5 M, 3 × 10−6 M),
ozagrel (10 − 5 M) or saline for 20 min. For each group, U46619
was added at a cumulative increasing concentration to the bath:
3 × 10− 10 M, 10− 9 M, 3 × 10− 9 M, 10− 8 M, 3 × 10− 8 M, 10− 7 M,
3 × 10− 7 M, and 10− 6 M. Tension was continuously recorded with a
data acquisition program (Chengdu Technology & Market Co., Ltd.
Chengdu, China).

2.4. In vitro hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R)
2.4.1. Primary culture of RBMECs
RBMECs were isolated from the brains of Sprague-Dawley rats (days
6–8) according to the method of Abbott et al. (Abbott et al., 1992) with
minor modiﬁcations by Fang et al. (Fang et al., 2007). The RBMECs were
collected and then cultured in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with
20% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. RBMECs were used for
experiments after they were seeded at a density of 5 × 104/ml in
24-well plates and grown in a monolayer,.

2.4.2. Drug treatment and H/R
After reaching conﬂuence, RBMECs were incubated with N2 or
PBS 24 h before H/R injury. 6 groups were set as follows: control
(PBS), H/R (PBS), ozagrel (10− 5 M) and N2 (3 × 10− 5 M, 10− 5 M,
and 3 × 10− 6 M). Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) was used as
an in vitro model for H/R damage (Deng et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, N2,
ozagrel or PBS-incubated RBMECs were exposed to 30 mM
Na 2 S 2 O 4 in DMEM (low glucose) medium for 2 h (hypoxia) and
then cultured in Na 2 S 2 O 4 -free DMEM-F12 medium for 2 h
(reoxygenation).

2.4.3. Cell morphology and viability assay
After H/R treatment, the morphology of RBMECs was observed
and photographed with an optical microscope. Cell viability was
measured by quantitative colorimetric assay with 3-(4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
with minor modiﬁcations, which demonstrates the mitochondrial
activity of living cells (Wei et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, MTT was added
to the medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 4 h at
37 °C. The insoluble formazan crystals formed in each well were
dissolved in 200 μl DMSO, 150 μl of the dissolved solution was
transferred to 96-well plate and the optical density (OD) value at
570 nm was read. Cell viability was quantiﬁed as the OD value of
each well/the average OD value of the control group and expressed
as a percentage.

RBMECs after H/R treatment and measured according to the instructions of the ELISA kits.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Neurological deﬁcit scores were expressed as a median and analyzed
using Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance with a rank test
followed by post hoc Dunn's multiple comparison test. Other data
were expressed as the means ± SD and assessed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett post-hoc comparison with
the exception of two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc
comparison for rat aorta contraction. Results were considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant with P b 0.05.
3. Results

2.4.4. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay
The effects of N2 on the TXA2 biosynthesis pathway were investigated by ELISA assay. The activity of COX and TXS was indicated by the
production of PGH2 and TXA2, respectively. Because PGH2, TXA2 and
PGI2 are unstable, they are measured by their stable metabolites:
PGE2, TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α. We conducted an ELISA assay for PGE2
and TXB2 to determine the inﬂuence of N2 on COX and TXS. In addition,
to explore whether N2 affects the production of PGI2, we measured the
level of 6-keto-PGF1α. Samples were prepared from the supernatant of

3.1. Effects of N2 on the neurological deﬁcit score
Rats with higher scores demonstrated more severe neuronal function
impairment, indicating more severe impairment in motor motion. A
signiﬁcant increase in neurological score was exhibited by rats subjected
to focal cerebral I/R injury, whereas no neurological deﬁcits were
observed in sham-operated animals. N2 treatment (15 mg/kg and
7.5 mg/kg) and clopidogrel (7.5 mg/kg) produced a signiﬁcant reduction
in neurological scores compared with the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 2).

3.2. Effects of N2 on the Y-maze test
An increase in the learning score and decrease in the memory score
represent spontaneous alternation impairment, respectively, indicating
a detriment in short-term spatial learning and memory. Focal cerebral I/
R injury causes signiﬁcant learning and memory impairment in rats.
However, post-treatment with 15 mg/kg N2 and 7.5 mg/kg clopidogrel
signiﬁcantly ameliorated both learning and memory impairment.
7.5 mg/kg N2 improved the spontaneous alternation in learning and
improved memory ability with no statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 3).
3.3. Effects of N2 on infarct volume
When animals were subjected to ischemia insult by left MCAO, the
infarct area was observed in left cortex and striatum. The infarct volume
was signiﬁcantly reduced by post-treatment with N2 (15 and 7.5 mg/
kg) and clopidogrel (7.5 mg/kg) (Fig. 4).
3.4. Effects of N2 on U46619-induced rat aorta contraction ex vivo
Cumulative addition of the TXA2 analog U46619 (3 × 10−10-10−6 M)
induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the aorta segments in
each group. Ozagrel (10−5 M) inhibited U46619-induced contraction at
limited points. In contrast, the aorta contraction was signiﬁcantly reduced
by 3 × 10−5 M N2 when the of U46619 concentration was 3 × 10−8 M to
10−6 M. N2 at 10−5 M inhibited U46619-induced aorta contraction
without statistical signiﬁcance. N2 at 3 × 10−6 M did not inﬂuence
U46619-induced aorta contraction (data not shown) (Fig. 5).
3.4.1. Effects of N2 on cell morphology and viability
Cell morphology changes were observed after H/R. Compared with
the control group, damage to the cytoplasm and enlargement of the
intercellular space were evident in the H/R group. Compared

with the H/R group, the integrity of RBMECs in groups treated with N2
(3 × 10−5 and 10−5 M) and ozagrel (10−5 M) was improved (Fig. 6(A)).
Cell viability in the H/R group was signiﬁcantly decreased compared
with the control group. Incubation with N2 (3 × 10−5 and 10−5 M) and
ozagrel (10−5 M) signiﬁcantly increased the cell viability (Fig. 6(B)).
3.4.2. Effects of N2 on TXA2 biosynthesis
In vitro H/R caused a signiﬁcant increasing in PGE2 and TXB2, and a
decreasing in 6-keto-PGF1α production compared with the control
group. N2 and ozagrel decreased PGE2 production but without statistical
signiﬁcance. Incubation of N2 (3 × 10− 5 and 10− 5 M) and ozagrel
(10− 5 M) signiﬁcantly reduced TXB2 production. In addition, N2 at a
concentration of 3 × 10− 5 M signiﬁcantly increased 6-keto-PGF1α
production compared with the H/R group (Fig. 7).
4. Discussion
Ischemic stroke is caused by a reduction or complete block of blood
ﬂow, resulting in a deﬁciency in the glucose and oxygen supply to the
territory of the affected region (Tu, 2010). Currently, the main strategy
for ischemic stroke therapy is recanalization and neuroprotection.
However, studies have demonstrated that reperfusion after recanalization could produce even more severe brain damage, which is termed as
ischemia–reperfusion injury (Schaller and Graf, 2004; Pan et al., 2007).
In this study, we used an MCAO and reperfusion model to mimic I/R
injury in vivo, and OGD-induced H/R in vitro to investigate the protective
effects and related mechanisms of N2 in ischemic stroke.
The results of this study demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that N2 may
have neuroprotective effects, particularly in focal cerebral I/R injury.
Infarcts formed by MCAO are similar to the brain damage of ischemic
stroke in humans (Miller, 1999). In the case of the left MCA, it supplies
blood to the left cortical area and the hippocampus. These areas were
where we made observations using TTC staining of brain sections in
this study (Fig. 4). Damage to these areas results in impairment in the
learning and memory ability. The Y-maze reveals impairments in spatial

learning and memory, which require normal functioning of the
hippocampus by tests of spontaneous alternation (Wall et al., 2004). We
observed a reduction in the spontaneous alternation caused by MCAO
and reperfusion in the Y-maze test (Fig. 3). In addition, our study also
demonstrated that left MCAO and reperfusion produced an impairment
in motor function as measured by neurological deﬁcit score (Fig. 2).
Oral administration of 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg N2 signiﬁcantly reduced
the infarct area compared with the vehicle group, and it ameliorated the
impairment in learning and memory ability and motor function.
It has been reported that circulatory function is compromised in
cerebral I/R injury, and in turn, it promotes more severe brain damage
(Cortina et al., 2013). There is an enhancement in TXA2 production
and reduced PGI2 production in patients with ischemic stroke
(Schmitz et al., 1985; Santos et al., 2008). TXA2 could promote brain
damage and has strong effects in vascular contraction and endothelium
injury, further contributing to circulatory function impairment. PGI2
possesses the opposite biological activity of TXA2. Balanced vascular
tension and integration of the endothelium lining under the vascular
are essential for normal circulatory function (Ribeiro et al., 2009;
Palomares and Cipolla, 2011). BMECs regulate the selective transport

and metabolism of substances from blood to the brain and in the opposite direction from the parenchyma back to systemic circulation (Zheng
et al., 2003; Cardoso et al., 2010). Therefore, the integrity of BMECs is the
basis for brain circulation. H/R injury in vitro has been established to investigate comparable damage to in vivo I/R injury (Fang et al., 2013).
Our study demonstrates that H/R causes the morphology impairment
and cell death of RBMECs, while N2 (3 × 10 − 5 and 10 − 5 M) improves morphology and increases cell viability (Fig. 6). Moreover, our
data show that N2 incubation is effective in inhibiting U46619, an analog
of TXA2, induction of rat aorta contraction (Fig. 5). Therefore, we propose
the possibility that the neural-protective effects of N2 are related to improving circulatory function by protecting the endothelium and regulating vascular contraction.
Data from ELISA assays demonstrated that the H/R injury caused TXA2
over-excretion and PGI2 reduction. N2 incubation effectively reduced
TXA2 production, and caused a slight decrease in PGH2 production
(Fig. 7). These data suggested that N2 was effective reducing TXA2 production by inhibition of TXS, and the inﬂuence of N2 on COX was weak.
Taken as a whole, we have demonstrated the neural protective
effects of N2 on cerebral I/R in this study. This study also suggests that

the mechanism of this protective effect is associated with improving
circulatory function by maintaining the BMEC integrity and inhibiting
vascular contraction, which is likely to be mediated by regulation of
TXA2 production. Moreover, our data provide evidence that the effects
of N2 on the regulation of TXA2 production may be interpreted as
inhibition of TXS.
