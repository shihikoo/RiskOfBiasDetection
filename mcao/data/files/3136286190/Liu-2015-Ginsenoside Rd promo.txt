Aim: To investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rd (Rd) on neurogenesis in rat brain after ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI).
Methods: Male SD rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. The rats were
injected with Rd (1, 2.5, and 5 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) from d 1 to d 3 after MCAO, and with BrdU (50 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) from d 3 to d 6, then
sacrificed on 7 d. The infarct size and neurological scores were assessed. Neurogenesis in the brains was detected by BrdU, DCX,
Nestin, and GFAP immunohistochemistry staining. PC12 cells subjected to OGD/reperfusion were used as an in vitro model of brain
ischemia. VEGF and BDNF levels were assessed with ELISA, and Akt and ERK phosphorylation was measured using Western blotting.
Results: Rd administration dose-dependently decreased the infarct size and neurological scores in the rats with IRI. The high dose of
Rd (5 mg·kg-1·d-1) significantly increased Akt phosphorylation in ipsilateral hemisphere, and markedly increased the number of BrdU/
DCX and Nestin/GFAP double-positive cells in ischemic area, which was partially blocked by co-administration of the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. Treatment with Rd (25, 50, and 100 μmol/L) during reperfusion significantly increased the expression of VEGF and
BDNF in PC12 cells with IRI. Furthermore, treatment with Rd dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, and
significantly decreased PC12 cell apoptosis, which were blocked by co-application of LY294002.
Conclusion: Rd not only attenuates ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat brain, but also promotes neurogenesis via increasing VEGF and
BDNF expression and activating the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways.

Introduction

Recently, researchers have shown keen interest in neurogenesis after stroke. New neurons and glia are continuously
generated by neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular
zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the adult brain
during the restoration of nerve function, a process called neurogenesis. According to several studies, neurogenesis occurs
in response to IRI, causing brain structure remodeling and
self-repair[1, 2]. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
can activate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of
NSCs and promote their integration in existing nerve tissues[3].

In addition, stroke induced neurogenesis reportedly still exists
in aging rats, although the capacity for neurogenesis in young
adults is higher[4]. In recent years, neurogenic Chinese herbal
medicines have generated great interest among researchers, particularly regarding their utility for rehabilitating the
penumbra after ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Although
much work has been done, more studies are still needed to
ascertain the mechanisms of function of these Chinese herbal
medicines after stroke.
Ginsenosides are the most active components of ginseng;
more than 40 ginsenosides, including Rd, have been identified and isolated from this root[5]. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that Rd is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic
stroke. Rd can protect neurons from oxidative stress injury
caused by hydrogen peroxide and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)[6]. In addition, Rd can cross the intact blood-brain
barrier and exert protective effects during both transient and

permanent MCAO in rats[7]. However, although this traditional Chinese medicine has long been used to strengthen the
body’s resistance to pathogenic factors, the beneficial effects of
ginsenosides on cerebral self-remodeling after ischemia have
not been fully elucidated. Thus, in this study, we aim to verify
whether Rd, an active ingredient of ginseng, promotes neurogenesis after MCAO.
Several cytokines are involved in neurogenesis. VEGF is the
strongest growth factor that promotes SVZ neurogenesis and
neural migration. According to some studies, VEGF overexpression reduces infarct volume and improves post-ischemic
motor function, which may contribute to brain recovery and
repair[8]. Furthermore, vascular endothelial cells secrete VEGF
to promote the proliferation of NSCs[9]. BDNF is a member of
the nerve growth factor family and is released after hypoxia
or ischemia to protect the brain from injury. BDNF plays an
important role in narrowing infarct size, protecting penumbral neurons and repairing broken neurons[10]. This factor can
stimulate adult neurogenesis and enhance the appearance and
migration of new neurons in the SVZ and dentate gyrus [11].
Notably, the expression of both VEGF and BDNF is regulated
by PI3K/Akt[12] and ERK1/2 pathways[13], and Rd can activate
these pathways[14]. Therefore, in the present study, we demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways are involved
in the protective effects of Rd. Further, this is the first study,
to our knowledge, to examine the potential link between the
ginsenosides and neurogenesis in response to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

Materials and methods

Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (220–240 g), provided
by the Beijing Vital River Company, were housed in the laboratory animal room and maintained at 25±1 °C with 65%±5%
humidity on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:30 to
19:30) for at least 1 week before the start of the experiments.
The animals were given food and water ad libitum. All experimental protocols described in this study were approved by
the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of
Xiyuan Hospital, at the China Academy of Chinese Medical
Sciences.
Drugs
The Rd (white powder, purity of ginseng >95%) used in the
present study was kindly donated by the School of Medicine,
Beijing University. Rd was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for the in vitro experiments and was dissolved in 0.9%
physiological saline containing 5% CMC-Na for the in vivo
experiments.
Materials and reagents
The mouse anti-BrdU antibody was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), while the rabbit
anti-DCX, rabbit anti-GFAP and mouse anti-Nestin antibodies
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA). Anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 antibodies were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) and the fetal bovine serum (FBS) used for
cell culture and treatments were purchased from Gibco Co
(CA, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure
goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The rabbit anti-ERK-1/2,
mouse anti-phospho-ERK-1/2 (pThr202/pTyr204), mouse
anti-Akt and rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (pThr324/pSer437)
antibodies were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA),
while the PI3 Kinase inhibitor, LY294002, was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (USA). The VEGF and BDNF levels
were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA), using kits produced by R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Akt and ERK were electrophoretically transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microporous membranes
(Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then visualized
using the Enhanced SuperSignal West femto kit from Pierce
(Rockford, IL, USA). The Labotect CO2-Incubator was a product of SANYO Electric Co Ltd (Los Angeles, CA, USA). The
OGD device was built by the experimenters.
Drug treatment
Before the surgical operation, the male SD rats were randomly
divided into 4 groups (10 animals/group): the sham group,
the IRI group, the IRI+Rd (5 mg/kg) group, and the IRI+Rd (5
mg/kg)+LY294002 (10 mg/kg) group. From d 1 to d 3 after
MCAO, the rats were given Rd (5 mg/kg) daily by intraperitoneal injection (ip). The LY294002 (10 mg/kg, ip) was injected
30 min before MCAO and again 48 h after reperfusion. The
sham and MCAO controls were given an equal volume of the
vehicle (0.9% physiological saline contained 5% CMC-Na).
To assess infarct size in vivo, the male SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (6 animals/group): the sham
group, the IRI group, the IRI+Rd (5 mg/kg) group, the IRI+Rd
(2.5 mg/kg) group and the IRI+Rd (1 mg/kg) group. From
d 1 through d 3 after MCAO, the rats were given Rd or vehicle
by intraperitoneal injection (ip).
To detect Akt phosphorylation in vivo, the male SD rats
were randomly divided into 5 groups (3 animals/group), as
mentioned above. Both 1 h before and 12 h after reperfusion,
the rats were given either Rd or the vehicle by intraperitoneal
injection (ip).
Transient MCAO
Rats with physiological variables within normal ranges were
subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by right
MCAO as previously described[15]. After 90 min of MCAO, the
suture was pulled back until the tip reached the suture around
the internal carotid artery (ICA) to restore blood flow (reperfusion). After the wound was closed, the animals were allowed
to recover from anesthesia before they were returned to their
home cages.
BrdU labeling and tissue preparation
To label dividing cells, intraperitoneal injections of BrdU (50

mg/kg) were given once daily after MCAO from d 3 to d 6 (5
animals/group).
Rats were sacrificed 7 d after MCAO by an overdose of
3.5% chloral hydrate (0.1 mL/kg) and transcardially perfused
with 0.9% saline solution followed by 4% ice-cold phosphatebuffered paraformaldehyde (PFA, 40 g/L). The brains were
removed, postfixed overnight, and equilibrated in phosphatebuffered 30% sucrose (200 g/L). Coronal sections at 1.0 to 0.2
mm from bregma were used for immunohistochemical staining and were cut on a freezing microtome (Leica CM3000, Germany) at a thickness of 25 μm.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining
Frozen sections were double-stained by the colocalization of
phenotypic markers using the following primary antibodies
(and their concentrations): rabbit polyclonal anti-Doublecortin
(DCX) to label neural progenitor cells (1:100); mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU to label dividing cells (1:100); rabbit antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), to label mature astrocytes (1:100); mouse polyclonal anti-Nestin to label neuronal
stem cells (1:100). Secondary antibodies: anti-mouse, rabbit
and goat IgG-FITC and IgG-Cy3 (1:50; Chemicon). Confocal
images were taken using a Zeiss LSM-510 microscope.
Measurement of infarct volume
To assess infarct size in vivo, the rats were deeply anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate and then decapi­tated 7 d
after reperfusion, after which the whole brains were rapidly
removed. Coronal sections (n=6 for each group) were cut into
2-mm slices and stained with standard 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37 °C,
followed by overnight immersion in 4% formalin. Infarct
volume, expressed as a percentage of the whole-brain volume,
was measured by an image pro­cessing and analysis system
(1.25×objective, Q570IW; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and was
calculated by integra­tion of the infarct area on each brain section along the rostral-caudal axis.
Assessment of neurological deficit score
The neurological deficit score was assessed 24 h and 7 d after
reperfusion. Each rat was scored by 2 examiners who were
kept unaware of the identity of the rat and the treatment protocol. The following neurological deficit scoring (NDS) system
was used: 0, no motor deficits (normal); 1, forelimb weakness
and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held by tail
(mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side but normal posture
at rest (moderate); 3, unable to bear weight on the affected
side at rest (severe); and 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity
or barrel rolling (critical). If no deficit was observed 2 h recovering from anesthesia, the animal was removed from further
study.
Cell culture and OGD model
PC12 cells were kindly donated by the School of Medicine,
Beijing University. These cells were grown in DMEM with
high glucose containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and

100 U/mL streptomycin in a humid chamber at 37 °C under
5% CO2. The OGD insult, followed by reoxygenation, is used
as an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia.
PC12 cells were seeded at 1×106 cells/well in 6-well plates,
incubated overnight and then washed twice with glucose-free
Earle’s balanced salt solution (glucose-free OGD g/L: NaCl 6.8,
KCl 0.4, CaCl2·2H2O 0.264, MgSO4·7H2O 0.2, NaH2PO4·2H2O
0.156, NaHCO 3 2.2). The cells were divided into different groups: the control group, the OGD model group, the
OGD+low dose Rd group (25 μmol/L), the OGD+middle
dose Rd group (50 μmol/L), the OGD+high dose Rd group
(100 μmol/L) and the Rd (50 μmol/L)+LY294002 (10 μmol/L)
group. To induce OGD, the culture media was replaced with
glucose-free OGD and the cells were incubated in a modified
OGD device ventilated with a 95%N2–5%CO 2 gas mixture
for 30 min. Then, the cells were kept in the chamber at 37 °C
for 4 h. Next, normal serum-free DMEM (NaCl 6.8, KCl 0.4,
CaCl 2·2H 2O 0.264, MgSO 4·7H 2O 0.2, NaH 2PO 4·2H 2O 0.156,
NaHCO3 2.2, glucose 1.0) was replaced for another 6 h as the
OGD reperfusion model[16]. The control culture was subjected
to the same experimental procedures without exposure to
the glucose-free DMEM medium. The different concentrations of Rd (25, 50, and 100 μmol/L/dissolved in DMSO to
10 mmol/L) and LY294002 (10 μmol/L/dissolved in DMSO
to 10 mmol/L) were added after the 4 h OGD treatment
and throughout the OGD-reperfusion within the standard
medium. Then, the supernatants (SN) were collected for
cytokine detection, and the cells were collected for apoptosis
assays or Western blotting detection.
VEGF and BDNF assay
The supernatants (SN) containing VEGF and BDNF were centrifuged (1000×g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the concentrations of VEGF
and BDNF in the supernatants were measured with ELISA
kits, according to the manufacturers’ directions. Sample and
standard dilutions were made with the experimental media,
and the results are expressed as the means±SD[9].
Western blotting
Protein from PC12 cells was collected and diluted to 0.5 mg
protein/mL for the measurement of ERK and the phosphorylation of Akt. In vivo, the rats were deeply anesthetized with
3.5% chloral hydrate and then decapi­tated 24 h after reperfusion, after which the whole brains were rapidly removed. Cortical sec­tions at 1.0 to 2.0 mm from the infarcts were used for
Western blotting analysis. The total protein content was determined with BSA as a standard using the Bradford assay. Protein samples (20 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The blots were stained for phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), total
Akt, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pTyr204) and total ERK1/2.
The stained blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The Bio-Rad Image
Lab™ Version 3.0 software was used to quantify every blot,

and their mean densitometric×area values are depicted as bar
graphs.
Analysis of apoptosis
The cells were collected and double-stained with FITCconjugated Annexin-V (25 μg/mL) and propidium iodide (PI)
(50 μg/mL) 142 (Beckman Coulter) for 20 min in the dark.
Then the cells were collected on an Epic XL flow cytometer
equipped with a 488-nm 143 argon laser and analyzed using
the Expo32 flow cytometry software (Beckman Coulter).
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean±SD. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 11.0. ANOVA or nonparametric tests were used for the statistical analyses. P<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results

Effects of Rd on VEGF and BDNF concentrations in PC12 cells
treated with OGD/reperfusion
VEGF is one of the growth factors, and BDNF is one of the
neurotrophic factors that are related to neurogenesis. We
detected the VEGF and BDNF levels by analyzing the supernatants from PC12 cells after OGD. As expected, the expression
of VEGF and BDNF was enhanced after OGD/reperfusion as
compared with the control group (Figure 1). After OGD, the
PC12 cells were treated with different doses of Rd (25, 50, or

100 μmol/L). The results showed that the VEGF expression
was significantly higher in the 50 μmol/L Rd treatment group
compared with the control (P<0.05; Figure 1A) and that the
BDNF levels were significantly higher in both the 50 and 100
μmol/L Rd treatment groups than in the control (P<0.05; Figure 1B). Thus, Rd treatment strengthened the expression of
VEGF and BDNF after OGD/reperfusion.
Effects of Rd on Akt and ERK signaling activation in PC12 cells
treated with OGD/reperfusion
It has been shown that activation of Akt and ERK pathways,
which can be detected by the phosphorylation of these two
proteins, mediates neurogenesis in PC12 cells[17] and in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells[18]. Therefore, we investigated
the effects of Rd on the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2.
In the current study, increased phosphorylation of Akt and
ERK was detected in PC12 cells treated with OGD/reperfusion, and Rd (50 and 100 μmol/L) significantly (P<0.05) amplified the Akt and ERK phosphorylation triggered by OGD/
reperfusion (Figure 2). These results suggest that the modu-

lation of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling may be one of the
pathways by which Rd exerts its effects after OGD.
Disruption of the PI3K/Akt pathway reversed the biological
effects of RD on PC12 apoptosis
To determine whether the PI3K/Akt pathway is necessary
for the observed effects of Rd, we evaluated the protective
effects of Rd in the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K.
Figure 3 shows that the level of phosphorylated Akt was significantly decreased by LY294002 (10 μmol/L). Compared
with the sham group, OGD decreased the cell viability significantly (P<0.05), which was reversed by 50 μmol/L Rd (Figure
4A–4C). Further studies showed that co-treatment with Rd
(50 μmol/L) and LY294002 (10 μmol/L) significantly (P<0.05)
increased the apoptotic population compared with the cells
treated with OGD+Rd (Figure 4D). These results demonstrate
that Rd opposes apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Effects of Rd on cerebral infarction and Akt phosphorylation
Transient focal ischemia for 90 min caused infarction at 7 d
post-reperfusion. Examination of serial brain sections showed
that Rd treatment (5 and 2.5 mg/kg) significantly decreased
the infarct volume compared with the I/R group 7 d after
focal ischemia/reperfusion. The neurological deficit scores
decreased in the I/R group, and significant differences were
found at 24 h and 7 d after reperfusion compared with the Rd

(5 mg/kg) treatment group (Figure 5). These findings indicate
that Rd protects against ischemic brain injury. Additional
studies indicated that Rd (5 mg/kg) significantly increased
Akt phosphorylation 24 h after focal ischemia/reperfusion
(Figure 6).
Effects of Rd on neurogenesis
Next, we wondered whether Rd promoted neurogenesis after
MCAO/reperfusion through the PI3K/Akt pathway, so we
observed the number of cells 7 d post-reperfusion. The numbers of Nestin+/GFAP+ cells increased in the striatum and of
BrdU+/DCX+ cells increased in the dentate gyrus (DG) in areas
surrounding the ischemic core 7 d after MCAO/reperfusion,
and these increases were promoted by Rd (5 mg/kg, P<0.05).
Furthermore, the beneficial effects of Rd in promoting the

(P<0.05, P<0.01, Figure 7).

Discussion

After IRI/reperfusion, Rd promotes neurogenesis in response
to transient MCAO, increases the expression of VEGF and
BDNF, and activates the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways.
These findings suggest that Rd-mediated neurogenic mechanisms may be a target for treatments aimed at repairing ischemic injury after stroke in humans.
The traditional view held that the central nervous system
(CNS) of adult mammals was incapable of repair after transient MCAO. This opinion was demolished by research that
revealed the NSCs could differentiate into three main cells of
the CNS[1]. The injury caused by ischemia increases the migration of neuronal precursors, and a sequence and combination
of molecular signals does exist that stimulates neurogenesis
in the adult cerebral cortex. According to some studies, neurogenesis is induced by MCAO in several regions, including
the SVZ, neocortex, SEZ and striatum[19]. The NSCs and proliferating progenitors seem to decline in the aged SVZ and
striatum, which might be caused by the apoptosis of NSCs[4].
In our study, we investigated neurogenesis in the ipsilateral
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

striatum and DG after MCAO treated with Rd. Rd is already
recognized as effective and safe for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke[14]. Our results support the view that the protective effects of Rd against transient MCAO occur through the
promotion of neurogenesis (Figure 7).
VEGF, an endothelial cell (ECs) mitogen, promotes the proliferation of ECs, plays a role in neurotrophy and neuroprotection and improves learning and memory in rats[20]. Furthermore, VEGF reduces infarct size and improves the functional
outcome when administered within hours to days after MCAO
in rodents. Most important of all, VEGF increases the proliferation of neuronal precursors in the SVZ and their migration to the ischemic penumbra[8]. BDNF, as one of important
regulators of adult neurogenesis, has multiple effects on neurogenesis. This factor can promote the survival, growth and
differentiation of neurons, and it can maintain their function
and regeneration. In addition, BDNF plays an important role
in enhancing synaptic plasticity in long-term potentiation,
learning and memory[21]. These findings are consistent with
the observation that BDNF treatment improves long-term
functional neurological outcomes by inducing neurogenesis,
parallel with the cellular proliferation and survival of NSCs[11].
In the present study, we thus demonstrated that Rd-mediated
promotion of neurogenesis increased the levels of VEGF and
BDNF in the CM of PC12 cells (Figure 1). The PI3K/Akt and
ERK1/2 pathways can modulate the activation of transcription factors and gene expression to influence neurogenesis[13].
Prior studies have shown that the VEGF- and BDNF-mediated
downstream signaling cascades for the survival of NSCs, such
as the PI3K/Akt or ERK pathways, are enchained upon activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) and VEGF receptor
2, respectively[11]. Based on these findings, we speculated that

Rd could activate the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK to protect neurons, and this idea is supported by our results (Figures
2–4).
Taken together, as a traditional Chinese medicine that can
strengthen the body’s resistance to pathogenic factors, ginsenosides such as Rd may prevent cerebral ischemic injury
by promoting neurogenesis and increasing the expression of
VEGF and BDNF, at least in part by activating the PI3K/Akt
and ERK1/2 pathways.
