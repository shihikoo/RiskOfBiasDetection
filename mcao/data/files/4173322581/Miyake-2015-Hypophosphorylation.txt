Abstract
Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus)
have an extraordinary capacity to withstand prolonged and
profound reductions in blood ﬂow and oxygen delivery to the
brain without incurring any cellular damage. As such, the
hibernation torpor of I. tridecemlineatus provides a valuable
model of tolerance to ischemic stress. Herein, we report that
during hibernation torpor, a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) occurs within the
brains of I. tridecemlineatus. Of note, rpS6 phosphorylation
was shown to increase in the brains of rats that underwent an
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. However, such an
increase was attenuated after the implementation of an
ischemic preconditioning paradigm. In addition, cultured cortical neurons treated with the rpS6 kinase (S6K) inhibitors, Dglucosamine or PF4708671, displayed a decrease in rpS6

phosphorylation and a subsequent increase in tolerance to
oxygen/glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemic
stroke. Collectively, such evidence suggests that the downregulation of rpS6 signal transduction may account for a
substantial part of the observed increase in cellular tolerance
to brain ischemia that occurs during hibernation torpor and
after ischemic preconditioning. Further identiﬁcation and
characterization of the mechanisms used by hibernating
species to increase ischemic tolerance may eventually clarify
how the loss of homeostatic control that occurs during and
after cerebral ischemia in the clinic can ultimately be minimized and/or prevented.

whole-body metabolism drops to a mere fraction of its basal
level (i.e. ~ < 5% of normal) (Storey 2003). Consistent with
such a profound overall reduction, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
has been noted to fall to severely ischemic levels during
torpor (Frerichs et al. 1994). Despite these intense changes,
hibernators are capable of blunting the otherwise destructive
effects of ischemia and, in so doing, repeatedly return to the
euthermic state without any evidence of damage to tissue.
Beyond the natural ischemic tolerance displayed by
hibernators during the torpor phase, tolerance within the
brain can also be induced by a variety of stimuli through the
implementation of preconditioning. For example, sub-lethal
ischemic challenges (Chen and Simon 1997; Barone et al.
1998), the administration of a low dose of lipopolysaccharide
(Tasaki et al. 1997; Dawson et al. 1999), or hypothermic
treatment (Lee et al. 2014) have been shown to be protective
in in vivo models of focal ischemia. While the mechanisms
governing the aforementioned have yet to be fully elucidated,
it is likely that overlap exists between those mechanisms
mediating protection during hibernation torpor and those that
increase resistance to ischemia after preconditioning.
One of the common mechanisms underlying tolerance to
ischemia may be the inhibition of protein synthesis. Reduction in the capacity of protein synthesis by knocking down
translational components has been shown to increase longevity in both yeast and worms (Kaeberlein and Kennedy
2007). Critically, it has been shown that hibernating animals
display a marked reduction in protein synthesis (Frerichs
et al. 1998) and further that the administration of protein
synthesis inhibitors (e.g. cycloheximide) reduces infarct
volume after a focal ischemia in rats (Snider et al. 2001).
During hibernation torpor, both the initiation and elongation
steps of protein synthesis are suppressed in the brain
(Frerichs et al. 1998).
Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is one of thirty-three 40S
ribosomal proteins (Wool et al. 1996) and has been
implicated as a key regulator in the biogenesis of translational components (Fumagalli and Thomase 2000). Phosphorylation sites within the rpS6 have been mapped to ﬁve
clustered residues (Ser 235, Ser 236, Ser 240, Ser 244, and
Ser 247) (Krieg et al. 1988), which are conserved from
drosophila to higher mammals (Krieg et al. 1988; Fumagalli
& Thomase). Early studies demonstrated a temporal correlation between rpS6 phosphorylation and the initiation of
protein synthesis following mitogenic/nutritional stimuli
(Kruppa and Clemens 1984). This model was further
supported by a series of experiments which demonstrated
the intimate spatial relationship of rpS6 with tRNA,
initiation factors and mRNA (Nygard and Nilsson 1990).
Of note, attempts to establish a casual relationship between
rpS6 phosphorylation and protein synthesis have yielded
conﬂicting results and as such the precise physiologic role
of rpS6 phosphorylation continues to remain controversial
(reviewed in Meyuhas 2008).

Herein, we show that rpS6 is hypophosphorylated in the
neuronal cells of I. tridecemlineatus during hibernation
torpor. We also demonstrate that rats, which have undergone
ischemic preconditioning, display suppressed rpS6 phosphorylation under prolonged/severe focal ischemia. Furthermore,
we show that cultured cortical neurons display an increase in
ischemic tolerance to oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD)
when their rpS6 phosphorylation was reduced via treatment
with known ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) inhibitors
(i.e. D-glucosamine and PF-4708671). Collectively, these
results strongly suggest that the hypophosphorylation of the
rpS6 occurs in the brains of animals capable of tolerating an
otherwise destructive ischemic insult thereby suggesting that
the focused investigation of such biological networks may be
able to help guide new strategies for preventing and/or
treating ischemic stroke.

Materials and methods
Animal preparation
Thirteen-lined ground squirrel (I. tridecemlineatus)
Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were captured by USDA-licensed
trappers (TLS Research, Bartlett, IL, USA). All ensuing animal
experiments were approved by the NINDS Animal Care and Use
Committee. Both male and female squirrels were used equally for
this study, and all animals were between 1 and 3 years of age, but
because the animals were caught in the wild there is no way to know
the exact age of the animals; accordingly we acknowledge that our
study is limited as the exact age of the hibernating animals is
unknown. The squirrels were housed, fed and induced to hibernate
as has been described previously (Frerichs et al. 1994; Lee et al.
2007). Animals in seven different phases of the hibernation cycle
were differentiated via body temperature (Tb), time and respiratory
rate as described previously (Frerichs et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2007).
Active animals at room temperature (ART) designates active
animals housed in a room with an ambient temperature of 21°C
(Tb = 34–37°C). Active animals in cold room (ACR) designates
active animals that had not entered hibernation torpor housed in the
cold chamber for 4–5 days (Tb = 34–37°C). Animals in the
entrance phase (EN) of hibernation designates animals, which were
in the entrance phase of hibernation (31°C > Tb > 12°C). Torpor
animals were selected after they had been in the torpor phase for
more than 5 days, aroused and then re-entered the torpor phase for
either 1 or 2 additional periods. Animals in early torpor (EH) phase
designates animals in early torpor and was deﬁned as 1 day after
entrance into torpor (Tb = 5–8°C). Animals in late torpor (LH)
phase designates torpor animals that have remained in the torpor
state for more than 5 days, but had not yet begun to undergo
periodic arousal (Tb = 5–8°C). Spontaneously arousing (AR)
designates animals that were arousing without any stress and/or
signals (e.g. touching or warming); these animals were characterized by an increased respiratory rate of > 60 breaths/minute
accompanied by the persistent of a low body temperature (Tb = 9–
12°C). Aroused interbout (IA) animals designates aroused interbout
animals that have been in an active state inside the hibernaculum
for at least 7 h (Tb = 34–37°C). Animals were killed via

decapitation under anesthesia (5% isoﬂurane in 30% O2/70%
N2O). Brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, thymus and
spleen were immediately removed, washed with chilled 0.15 M
NaCl, frozen instantly using 2-methylbutane and were subsequently stored at 80°C.
Rats
Male Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) weighing
between 270 and 370 g were used for the in vivo preconditioning
study. Animals were divided into six groups. Group 1 (n = 4)
underwent sham surgery only, while group 2 (n = 4) underwent
preconditioning. Both groups 1 and 2 were killed 72 h later. Group
3 (n = 4) underwent sham surgery and group 4 (n = 4) underwent
preconditioning yet 72 h later both groups underwent 3 h of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Group 5 (n = 4) underwent
sham surgery and group 6 (n = 4) underwent preconditioning.
Again, both of them were followed 72 h later by 24 h of MCAO.
Intraluminal occlusion of middle cerebral artery
Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane for induction and 1.5%
isoﬂurane for maintenance of anesthesia, respectively, in 30%O2/
70%N2O. The core body temperature was monitored and maintained
at 37.0  0.5°C using a heating pad and a lamp. The left femoral
artery was cannulated with PE-50 catheter (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to monitor the mean blood pressure.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the reversible intraluminal
MCAO method described by Longa et al. (1989), with slight
modiﬁcations. We conﬁrmed by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry that a
75 ~ 90% CBF reduction was seen immediately upon MCAO, and
that CBF was restored fully after removing the suture.
Focal ischemia for in vivo preconditioning
Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed via a
midline cervical incision. The occipital branch of the external
carotid artery (ECA) was ligated at its origin using a 6-0 silk suture
and coagulated distally; other branches of the ECA were also
coagulated if present. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated
and carefully separated from vagus nerve. The pterygopalatine
artery was ligated with 6-0 silk suture close to its origin. 5-0 silk
sutures were tied loosely around the CCA and the ICA adjacent to
the ECA to avoid the regurgitation from the ECA stump and an
arteriotomy was made in the ECA slightly proximal to the ligation.
An ~ 5 cm length of a 4-0 silicone coated nylon monoﬁlament
(Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA, USA) was introduced into the
ECA stump and advanced into the ICA 18–20 mm past the carotid
artery bifurcation. At this point, the intraluminal ﬁlament occluded
the origin of the MCA. Three minutes later, the ﬁlament was gently
withdrawn and the silk suture around the CCA removed to allow
reperfusion. Finally, the origin of ECA stump was ligated with 6-0
suture. Three minutes of temporary MCAO was selected based on a
series of pilot studies (data not shown). Sham surgeries were
performed in an identical manner to those undertaken during
preconditioning except that the origin of the MCA was never
occluded.
Prolonged focal ischemia
To evaluate the effects of preconditioning, prolonged MCAO was
induced 72 h after either a 3-min period of temporary MCAO or

945

sham surgery. The procedure employed to induce prolonged MCAO
was similar to that used for preconditioning except that the
intraluminal ﬁlament was inserted into the small puncture of the
CCA. Brieﬂy, before puncturing, the CCA was double-ligated
proximally with a 5-0 silk suture, and the ICA was tied loosely with
5-0 silk suture to avoid hemorrhage. The CCA containing the
ﬁlament was ligated distally with 6-0 sutures, and then the 5-0 silk
suture around the ICA was removed. Finally, the silicone-coated
nylon ﬁlament was advanced to same point (18–20 mm past the
carotid artery bifurcation) employed during preconditioning ischemia.
Measurement of infarct size
Twenty-four hours after prolonged MCAO animals in groups 5 and
6 were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg,
intraperitoneal), perfused transcardially with 0.01 M phosphate
buffer (PB) and ﬁnally ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
PB (pH 7.4). The brains were post-ﬁxed for an additional 12 h in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4), and stored in 20%
sucrose in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4). The sections (20-lm thick) were
stained with cresyl violet and were analyzed using Image J (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA) at four coronal levels (bregma +1.00, 0.60,
2.20 and 3.80). Infarct sizes were calculated and corrected for
brain edema (Swanson et al. 1990). The persons who measured and
analyzed the infarction volumes are completely blinded. Data are
presented as mean  SD. Differences among the groups with regard
to infarct sizes were determined by using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni correction. A p < 0.05 value was
considered signiﬁcant.
Cloning of the small ribosomal protein S6 cDNA from the 13-lined
ground squirrel
To obtain the 13-lined ground squirrel rpS6 cDNA fragment,
primers were designed as follows: 50 -atgaagctgaatatctccttccc-30 and
50 -tttttgactggactcagatttagaag-30 . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
ampliﬁcation using a 13-lined ground squirrel brain cDNA library as
a template was performed and the ampliﬁed DNA fragments were
subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
sequenced.
Isolation of rat cortical neurons and cortical neuronal culture
Embryos of Sprague Dawley rats were used to prepare cortical
neuronal cultures. Cortices were dissected from rat embryos (E18)
and dissociated with papain (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood,
NJ, USA), and plated out at 1 000 000 cells per well on poly-Llysine-coated six-well plates in Neurobasal/B27 media (Lee et al.
2009). Cells were used after 7 days in culture.
Oxygen/glucose deprivation, restoration of oxygen/glucose and cell
death assessments
OGD experiments on cortical neuronal cultures were performed as
has been described previously (Heldmaier et al. 2004) (Lee et al.
2007). After 5 h of OGD, plates were taken out of the hypoxia
chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Media
was replaced with Neurobasal/B27, and the cultures were incubated
further for 16 h allowing for the restoration of oxygen/glucose
(ROG). Of note, cells were preincubated with S6K inhibitors (Dglucosamine or PF-4708671) at various concentrations (0–10 mM

and 0–10 lM respectively) before being subjected to OGD. These
drugs were also added during OGD/ROG in order to maximize any
effect. Stock solutions of D-glucosamine were made in H2O and
those of PF-4708671 in dimethylsulfoxide. Cell death after OGD/
ROG was measured via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Western blotting
All antibodies with the exception of protein phosphatase 2A
catalytic subunit (PP2A/c) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) and
beta-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA. Brieﬂy, crushed frozen
brains were added to a lysis buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, 60 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), 50 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 1 lM leupeptin and homogenized on ice.
Homogenates were then sonicated for 10–15 s and boiled for 5 min
at 95°C. Samples were then centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min at
4°C. Thirty micrograms of protein were electrophoresed in a sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The membrane was incubated with a blocking buffer [5%
nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
0.05% Tween 20 (PBST)] for 1 h at 25°C, followed by incubation
with a primary antibody for 1 h at 25°C or overnight at 4°C. The
primary antibodies were used 1 : 1000 dilutions, unless stated
otherwise. The membrane was then washed four times in PBST,
probed with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody
(1 : 5000) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 25°C. Detection of the signal
was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence plus western
blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) or Immobilon Western (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA,
USA). A t-test was used for statistical analysis and a p value of
< 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections (20-lm thick) were cut on a cryostat. Brain sections
(free ﬂoating) were incubated overnight with the following
antibodies: rpS6 (1 : 500) and phospho (Ser 240 and 244) rpS6
(1 : 500). The sections were subsequently incubated with a
biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA) at 1 : 200 for 1 h and then incubated with an avidin–
biotin peroxidase complex solution (Vector Laboratories) at 1 : 100
for 1 h. After each incubation, the sections were rinsed for 15 min
with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Finally, the products of the
immunoreaction were visualized using diaminobenzidine as the
substrate (Vector Laboratories). To evaluate the ischemic core, the
transition area and peri-infarct area, sections stained with cresyl
violet were compared to those that were immunostained.
Measurement of S6K activity
Brieﬂy, crushed frozen brains were added to a lysis buffer
containing 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 1%
NP40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride and 10 lg/mL leupeptin/aprotinin, 50 mM
b-glycerolphosphate, 50 mM sodium ﬂuoride and 1 mM sodium
vanadate. Benzamidine, leupeptin/aprotinin, b-glycerolphosphate,

sodium ﬂuoride and sodium vanadate were supplied via the
reconstitution of a lyophilized powder (i.e. MS-SAFE Protease
and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Samples were homogenized three times on ice for 20, 10 and 10 s,
then sonicated for 10 s on ice. Samples were subsequently
centrifuged at 15 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Protein concentration
in the supernatant was determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic
acid Protein Assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and an
equal concentration of protein from each sample was used for the
assay. The p70S6 kinase activity assay was carried out according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (ADI-EKS-470; Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses between two groups were done using the
Student’s t-test. Repeated measure ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
correction was applied to the analyses of infarct volumes at four
coronal levels (Fig. 7b). All reported p-values are two-sided and are
considered as signiﬁcant if the p-values are < 0.05.

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of the 13-lined ground
squirrel rpS6
We searched the GenBank database to ﬁnd conserved
regions within the rpS6 cDNA sequences between humans,
rats and mice. Conserved areas in the 50 and 30 regions were
found and as such a cDNA fragment, which contained the
coding region, was ampliﬁed via PCR using a 13-lined
ground squirrel cDNA brain library as a template. The
coding cDNA sequence (submitted to GenBank: Acc #
KP453774) displayed a high similarity with human
(91.73%), rat (89.73%) and mouse (87.87%) rpS6. The
putative amino acid sequence of the 13-lined ground squirrel
rpS6 was essentially homologous with that of rat (100%),
mouse (100%) and human (99.6%). Of note, the amino acid
sequences recognized by anti-phospho-rpS6 antibody (S235/
S236, S240/S244) and total-rpS6 antibody (residues 185–205
of the rpS6 protein) were completely conserved thereby
allowing for an accurate comparison to unfold (Fig. 1).
rpS6 phosphorylation in the brains of 13-lined ground
squirrels was significantly decreased during hibernation
torpor
Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were captured during summer, housed individually at 21°C and induced to undergo
hibernation during the fall/winter. A hibernation bout may
last for weeks and consists of entry into, maintenance of and
arousal from torpor. Animals in seven different phases of the
hibernation bout were differentiated by body temperature,
time and respiratory rate (Fig. 2a). rpS6 phosphorylation in
the brain across the seven different phases was examined via
immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-rpS6 (S240/S244)
and anti-total-rpS6 antibodies. rpS6 phosphorylation significantly decreased within the brain from animals in the

entrance phase of hibernation to AR as compared with the
active states, which included ART, ACR and 7 h aroused
interbout animals (Fig. 2a). Such a decrease in rpS6
phosphorylation was also witnessed in the heart, kidney
and liver during hibernation torpor (Fig. 2b). Of note, the
total amount of rpS6 protein did not change signiﬁcantly
within the brain (Fig. 2a), heart, kidney and liver, but did
decrease in the spleen, skeletal muscle and thymus during
hibernation torpor (Fig. 2b).
Signal transduction upstream of the rpS6 protein within the
brain cortices of 13-lined ground squirrels during
hibernation
Phosphorylation of rpS6 and its upstream kinases in cortical
brain sections were examined via immunoblotting. Representative immunoblots are shown in Fig. 3(a), and their quantitative data are shown in Fig. 3(b). Brain cortex samples from
torpor animals (H) (n = 3) were compared with those, which
were deemed to be ACR (n = 3). First, we examined the
phosphorylation of S6K, which is a kinase that targets the rpS6
protein (Fumagalli and Thomase 2000). Interestingly, S6K
phosphorylation on residues T421/S424, which are supposed
to be phosphorylated by p44/42 MAPK (Dufner and Thomas

1999; Page et al. 2006) decreased during hibernation torpor. In
contrast, phosphorylation on T389 (a substrate of mTOR)
(Dufner and Thomas 1999) increased during torpor. The total
amount of S6K protein did not change. S6K activity categorically requires the phosphorylation of the T389 residue
(reviewed in Magnuson et al. 2012) which was increased
during hibernation torpor. However, for full activation, S6K
should also be phosphorylated on its autoinhibitory domain
(i.e. residues T421/S424) (Han et al. 1995). These data
suggested that the activity of S6K within the brains of torpor
animals may in fact be inhibited/diminished. Next, we
examined the activation state of the extracellular signalregulated kinase family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase p44/42 (p44/42MAPK), which is responsible for the
phosphorylation of residues T421/S424 on S6K. As expected,
the phosphorylation of T202/Y204 on the p44/42 MAPK was
decreased in torpor brains. However, the phosphorylation
status of T183/Y185 of another MAPK (the stress-activated
protein kinases/Jun amino-terminal kinases) was unchanged.
Of note, p44/42 MAPK and stress-activated protein kinases/
Jun amino-terminal kinases are activated through the phosphorylation of activation loop residues (i.e. T202/Y204 and
T185/Y187 respectively). We also examined levels of PP2A

Abstract
Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus)
have an extraordinary capacity to withstand prolonged and
profound reductions in blood ﬂow and oxygen delivery to the
brain without incurring any cellular damage. As such, the
hibernation torpor of I. tridecemlineatus provides a valuable
model of tolerance to ischemic stress. Herein, we report that
during hibernation torpor, a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) occurs within the
brains of I. tridecemlineatus. Of note, rpS6 phosphorylation
was shown to increase in the brains of rats that underwent an
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. However, such an
increase was attenuated after the implementation of an
ischemic preconditioning paradigm. In addition, cultured cortical neurons treated with the rpS6 kinase (S6K) inhibitors, Dglucosamine or PF4708671, displayed a decrease in rpS6

phosphorylation and a subsequent increase in tolerance to
oxygen/glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemic
stroke. Collectively, such evidence suggests that the downregulation of rpS6 signal transduction may account for a
substantial part of the observed increase in cellular tolerance
to brain ischemia that occurs during hibernation torpor and
after ischemic preconditioning. Further identiﬁcation and
characterization of the mechanisms used by hibernating
species to increase ischemic tolerance may eventually clarify
how the loss of homeostatic control that occurs during and
after cerebral ischemia in the clinic can ultimately be minimized and/or prevented.

Fig. 4 Relationship between protein phosphorylation (upstream of
ribosomal protein S6, rpS6 signal transduction) and squirrel body
temperature during entrance into hibernation torpor. Squirrels at
an interbout stage usually enter into torpor within 24 h after
arousal. Animals which start to re-enter torpor were identiﬁed, their
body temperatures measured and they were subsequently killed.
Protein extracts from their brain cortex were made, the phosphorylation of various proteins upstream of rpS6 signal transduction

were then examined by western blot analysis. (a) Representative
images of immunoblots. (b) Dot plots of body temperature versus
phosphorylation levels in individual animals. Each dot represents
an animal, and 24 animals altogether were analyzed. The

S424. We thus wondered whether this differentially phosphorylated S6K was in fact less active. We therefore
examined the S6K activity in the brain extracts from active
(ACR) and late torpor phase of hibernating squirrels via the
use of a solid-state ELISA S6K activity kit (ADI-EKS-470;
Enzo Life Sciences). As shown in Fig. 5, S6K activity within
the brain during the torpor phase of hibernation was
signiﬁcantly lower than that which is present in the active
phase of the hibernation bout. This result again suggested
that S6K is not fully active even though the T389 residue is
phosphorylated unless the C-terminal domain residues
(T421/S424) are also phosphorylated. Of note, we still
cannot exclude, the confounding effects of PP2A present in
the brain extracts despite the inclusion of phosphatase
inhibitors in preparatory buffers used to make the brain
tissue extracts.

the various stages of hibernation were examined using
immunohistochemistry. Of note, the majority of rpS6
immunoreactive cells located in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum appeared to be neurons. In active animals
(ART and ACR), P-S6 was clearly detectable in medium to
large-sized cells (~ 20 lm in diameter) with large nuclei (i.e.
cells that are morphologically typical of neuronal cells) in
cortex (Fig. 6a), and in Purkinje/granule cells within the
cerebellar cortex (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, granule cells within
the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells throughout the CA1 to
CA3 subﬁelds of the hippocampus were shown to be
immunopositive (Fig. 6c). In contrast, very little P-S6 was
observed in the brain of torpor phase (H) animals. Of note, as
was suggested via immunoblotting, the intensity of T-S6
immunoreactivity in the brain was not different between the
active (ART and ACR) and torpor phase (H) animals.

of preconditioning on rpS6 phosphorylation levels and
ischemic tolerance in the brain. Three minutes of brief
MCAO was used as an ischemic preconditioning (groups
2, 4 and 6). Sham-operated animals (i.e. no 3 min MCAO)
were used as controls (groups 1, 3 and 5). After 72 h, the
animals were then challenged with either 3 h (groups 3
and 4) or 24 h (groups 5 and 6) of prolonged (severe)
MCAO. First, we measured and compared infarct volumes
in the brain from groups 5 and 6 animals. As shown in
Fig. 7(b), infarct sizes in the animals which had been
preconditioned (group 6) were signiﬁcantly smaller at all
coronal levels we measured compared to the sham-operated
group (group 5) (p = 0.0482). Next, we measured rpS6
phosphorylation levels in the brain tissue collected from
the MCA perfused areas of groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 animals.
rpS6 phosphorylation on both the S235/S236 and the
S240/S244 sites were signiﬁcantly increased in the samples
from group 3 animals which were subjected to a 3 h
MCAO without preconditioning (Fig. 7c). However, no
increase was detected in the samples from group 4, which
had been preconditioned prior to the 3 h MCAO (Fig. 7c).
We also examined the distribution of the phosphorylated
rpS6 (P-S6) in the brain cortices from these animals by
immunohistochemisty. Much higher P-S6 levels were
detected in the brain cortex in group 3 animals than, as
expected, in the brain cortex from group 4 animals
(Fig. 7d), and groups 1 and 2 animals (Fig. 7e) supporting
the immunoblots discussed above (Fig. 7c). It is important
to note that there was no difference in the total amount of
rpS6 (T-S6) between the two groups (groups 3 and 4)
(Fig. 7c and d).

Cultured cortical neurons display an increased tolerance to
oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) when rpS6
phosphorylation is reduced via the S6K inhibitors,
D-glucosamine and PF-4708671
To establish a direct/translational connection between states
of ischemic tolerance and rpS6 hypophosphorylation, we
used cortical neurons derived from E18 rat embryos and two
known S6K inhibitors, D-glucosamine (Oh et al. 2007) and
PF-4708671 (Pearce et al. 2010). First, we conﬁrmed that
these inhibitors indeed inhibited the phosphorylation of rpS6.
As shown in Fig. 8(a) (representative immunoblots) and
Fig. 8(b) (quantiﬁcation of the immunoblots) when cells
were treated with 2.5 ~ 10 mM D-glucosamine or with
2.5 ~ 10 lM PF-4708671 overnight, the phosphorylated
forms of rpS6 (both S240/244 and S235/236 sites) were
diminished. As for S6K, the phosphorylation at T421/S424
sites was inhibited especially in D-glucosamine-treated cells,
but phosphorylation at the T389 site (i.e. the mTOR target
site) was not. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of P44/42
MAPK and AKT (S473) were also reduced in D-glucosamine
treated cells (Fig. 8a and b), which mirrors the situation in
hibernating squirrels as per the abovementioned (Figs 3 and
4) and which has been reported previously (Cai et al. 2004).
Recently, PF-4708671 has been reported to activate AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) in addition to a direct
inactivation of S6K activity (Vainer et al. 2014). We
examined the activation (phosphorylation at T172) of AMPK
in rat cortical neurons treated with PF-4708671. As shown in
Fig. 8(a), PF-4708671 (but not D-glucosamine) indeed
activated AMPK in a dose-dependent manner. Since activated AMPK inhibits mTORC1 and thus S6K activity
(Bolster et al. 2002), the activation of AMPK by PF4708671 may amplify the direct inhibition of S6K by the
compound. We next examined the effect of these inhibitors
on OGD/ROG-induced cell death. These inhibitors were
used during a preincubation (16 h) and/or during OGD/ROG
at two different concentrations (5 and 10 mM for Dglucosamine, 2.5 lM and 5 lM for PF-4708671). As
Fig. 8(c) demonstrates, OGD/ROG-induced cell death in
cortical neurons was signiﬁcantly reduced via exposure to
either of these drugs. Of note, pretreatment with D-glucosamine alone did not provide much protection, but
including it during OGD/ROG yielded a signiﬁcant reduction
in cell death (Fig. 8c upper panel). In the case of PF4708671, pretreatment with a 5 lM dose alone was already
effective (Fig. 8c lower panel).

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of rpS6
within the brains of 13-lined ground squirrels signiﬁcantly
decreases during hibernation torpor. The timing of such
dephosphorylation was shown to occur after the animal’s

body temperature decreased to < 20°C (i.e. during entrance
into hibernation) (Fig. 4). It is relevant to note that heart rate
falls prior to a reduction in an animal’s body temperature
during entrance into hibernation and reduces to a rate ~ 1/5
of the active state at 20°C Tb (Frerichs et al. 1994). Such
physiology reﬂects a CBF within the brain at Tb < 20°C that
is approaching oligemic levels (Frerichs et al. 1994). Critically, within this manuscript we have also reported that rpS6
phosphorylation in the brain peri-infarct regions of rats that
had undergone in vivo ischemic preconditioning was not
increased in response to prolonged MCAO; having shown
concurrently that without preconditioning, a marked elevation of rpS6 phosphorylation does occur within peri-infarct
areas (Fig. 7d). Of note, the temporal cellular depolarizations
that occur within the peri-infarct area have been suggested to
activate rpS6 signal transduction directly, as calcium inﬂux

via KCl-induced depolarization does increase rpS6 phosphorylation in cultured neurons (Lenz and Avruch 2005).
Eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2-alpha, is a translational
regulator and the phosphorylation of residue S51 inhibits
global protein synthesis (Pathak et al. 1988). Therefore, the
increase in eIF2-alpha phosphorylation appreciated in the
brains of I. tridecemlineatus during hibernation torpor
represents yet another key mechanism that may reduce the
rate of protein synthesis (Frerichs et al. 1998). Interestingly,
previous work has demonstrated that hibernators in the
entrance phase (Tb decreased from 19.0°C to 7.5°C) already
displayed as low a rate of protein synthesis as those
hibernators in the deep torpor phase (Frerichs et al. 1998).
Here, we show that eIF2-alpha phosphorylation did not
occur in the brain during entrance phase at
24°C > Tb > 12°C (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the marked

occur independently of eIF2-alpha phosphorylation. Since
the role of rpS6 phosphorylation in regulation of protein

synthesis is still controversial (reviewed in Meyuhas 2008),
we cannot conclude that the hypophosphorylation of rpS6 is
solely responsible for the low rate of protein synthesis during

hibernation entrance/torpor. Of note, the phosphorylation of
the C-terminal residues (T421/S424) of S6K was also
reduced during the entrance phase mimicking the kinetics
of rpS6 dephosphorylation (Fig. 4b). While rpS6 is the
major target, activated S6K is known to phosphorylate two
other proteins that may affect the ultimate rate of protein
synthesis (i.e. elongation factor 2, EF2 kinase – Wang et al.
2001; and initiation factor eIF4B – Raught et al. 2004).
Inhibition of protein synthesis during hibernation entrance/
torpor may therefore be caused by S6K inactivation and/or
partial inhibition (dephosphorylation of C-terminus residues), thereby leading to the collective inactivation of these
proteins (i.e. rpS6, elongation factor 2 kinase, eIF4B).
S6K1 isoform p70 (p70-S6K1) is the major and the most
studied rpS6 kinase among several others (S6K2, RSK1RSK2) (reviewed in Meyuhas 2008; Magnuson et al. 2012),
and is regulated by a series of complex multi-site phosphorylations. S6K1 activity absolutely requires the phosphorylation of three critical sites: the T-loop site on the activation
loop (T229) by PDK1, the TM site within the linker domain
(S371) and the HM site also in the linker domain (T389) by
mTOR (reviewed in Magnuson et al. 2012). In addition, four
residues in C-terminal pseudosubstrate domain (S411, S418,
T421, S424) are known to be phosphorylated in fully
activated S6K1 (reviewed in Magnuson et al. 2012; Ferrari
et al. 1992). Two models have thus been proposed for the
stepwise activation of S6K1, both of which require phosphorylation of C-terminal pseudosubstrate domain residues
prior to those of the HM (T389) and T-loop (T229)
phosphorylation (Weng et al. 1998) (Keshwani et al.
2011). Interestingly, during hibernation torpor, S6K within
the brain was highly phosphorylated at the T389 residue
despite the C-terminal residues (T421/S424) were dephosphorylated (Fig. 3), a ﬁnding that does not ﬁt with either of
the canonical activation models that have thus far been
proposed. The C-terminus residues of S6K (T421/S424) are
most likely phosphorylated by p44/42MAPK (Dufner and
Thomas 1999; Page et al. 2006), which we found to be
dephosphorylated during hibernation entrance/torpor (Figs 3
and 4). Interestingly, the decrease in p44/42MAPK phosphorylation during hibernation torpor has also been seen in
Arctic ground squirrels (i.e. another hibernating species)
(Zhu et al. 2005).
Beyond the hibernation torpor of the 13-lined ground
squirrel as a model of natural ischemic tolerance and/or the
rat model of induced cellular tolerance via ischemic preconditioning, we sought to further conﬁrm the relationship
between states of ischemic tolerance and rpS6/S6K
hypophosphorylation via the implementation of a reductionist experimental paradigm. By means of an in vitro model of
ischemia, in which cortical neurons derived from E18 rat
embryos were exposed to the known endogenous S6K
inhibitor D-glucosamine (Oh et al. 2007) and the highly
speciﬁc S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 (Pearce et al. 2010), we

955

conﬁrmed that these molecules indeed inhibited the phosphorylation of rpS6/S6K and that this was capable of
providing protection from the effects of OGD/ROG-induced
cell death.
Consistent with the aforementioned, knockdown of the C.
elegans S6K homolog (rsk-1) and rpS6 homolog (rps-6)
increase the life span of the worm and induce resistance to
thermal stress (Kaeberlein and Kennedy 2007). Life span
extension has also been observed in worms with reduced
expression of translation initiation factors and other ribosomal proteins (Kaeberlein and Kennedy 2007). Similarly,
mammalian hibernation torpor represents a physiological
state characterized by a marked decrease in protein synthesis
(Frerichs et al. 1998) and a substantial portion of hibernators
display an increase in longevity (Lyman et al. 1981).
Interestingly, the endogenous S6K inhibitor D-glucosamine
whose effects mimic hibernation torpor (Fig. 8a) was
reported to extend the life span of C. elegans and aged mice
(Weimer et al. 2014) as well.
In the present study, we present data that support the
hypothesis that down-regulation of rpS6 signal transduction
plays an important role in various forms of ischemic
tolerance (i.e. hibernation and ischemic preconditioning).
Although we have yet fully understand the network dynamics of rpS6 signal transduction in ischemic tolerance, the
elucidation of both upstream and downstream contributors
within the rpS6 pathway may be critical to ultimately
understanding the governing controllers of ischemic tolerance. It is the authors’ hope that such work may eventually
guide new strategies for both the prevention and treatment of
ischemic stroke.
