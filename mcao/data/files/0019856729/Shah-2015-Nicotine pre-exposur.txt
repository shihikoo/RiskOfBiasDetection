Nicotine pre-exposure reduces stroke-induced
glucose transporter-1 activity at the blood–brain
barrier in mice
Kaushik K Shah1, Purushotham Reddy Boreddy1,2 and Thomas J Abbruscato1*

Abstract
Background: With growing electronic cigarette usage in both the smoking and nonsmoking population, rigorous
studies are needed to investigate the effects of nicotine on biological systems to determine long-term health
consequences. We have previously shown that nicotine exerts specific neurovascular effects that influence blood brain
barrier (BBB) function in response to stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine on carrier-mediated
glucose transport into ischemic brain. Specifically, the present study investigates glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) function
and expression at the BBB in a focal brain ischemia model of mice pre-exposed to nicotine.
Methods: Nicotine was administrated subcutaneously by osmotic pump at the dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day for 1, 7, or
14 days to reflect the plasma levels seen in smokers. Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced by 1 h transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and 24 h reperfusion. Glucose transport was estimated using an in situ
brain perfusion technique with radiolabeled glucose and brain vascular GLUT1 expression was detected with
immunofluorescence.
Results: The nicotine pre-exposure (1, 7 & 14 day) resulted in significant reduction in D-glucose influx rate (Kin) across
the BBB, with a 49% reduction in 14 day nicotine-infused animals. We observed a 41% increase in carrier-mediated
glucose transport across the BBB in saline-infused tMCAO animals compared to saline-infused sham animals. Interestingly,
in the tMCAO group of animals pre-exposed to nicotine for 14 days had significantly attenuated increased glucose
transport by 80% and 38% compared to saline-infused tMCAO and sham animals respectively. Furthermore,
immunofluorescence studies of GLUT1 protein expression in the brain microvascular endothelium confirmed that
GLUT1 was also induced in saline-infused tMCAO animals and this protein expression induction was reduced
significantly (P < 0.01) with 14 day nicotine pre-exposure in tMCAO animals.
Conclusions: Nicotine pre-exposure reduced the IR-enhanced GLUT1 transporter function and expression at the
BBB in a focal brain ischemia mouse model. These studies suggest that nicotine exposure prior to stroke could
create an enhanced glucose deprived state at the neurovascular unit (NVU) and could provide an additional
vulnerability to enhanced stroke injury.

Background
In recent years, cigarette smoking has been considered
the second-leading risk factor for death and, in the
United States, it increases the risk of stroke by 2–4 fold
[1]. In addition to cigarette smoking, electronic nicotine
vaping device or “e-cigarette” usage has increased in recent years. A recent study in Addiction reports that ecigarette usage is growing in both populations of former
smokers or current smokers as an aid to cut down or
quit smoking [2]. Even though it is known that ecigarettes may provide a healthier option compared to
tobacco cigarettes with respect to carcinogens, the effects of long-term exposure to sometimes variable doses
of nicotine from e-cigarettes is yet to be determined and
will need to be validated with longitudinal studies. Additionally, stroke has become a fourth leading cause of
death and disability in the US [1]. Occlusion of a major
cerebral artery by an embolus or thrombosis can result
in transient or permanent deprivation of nutrient and
oxygen supply to parts of the brain. The brain relies
heavily on a continuous glucose supply that is regulated
across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) via glucose transporters to provide the fuel to maintain cellular ATP as
an energy source for brain activity [3-5]. Subsequent deficiency in the major obligatory brain fuels, glucose and
oxygen, elicits a number of important neurochemical
mechanisms (e.g. excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation) which can lead to irreversible brain damage.
This changing brain microenvironment is tightly regulated by the brain microvasculature which functions to
segregate the blood from brain interstitial fluid. The
endothelial cells of the BBB provide a dynamic interface
between the blood and central nervous system (CNS),
maintaining brain homeostasis by selectively limiting the
passage of solutes/nutrient/ions from the circulating
blood into and out of the brain and it plays an important
role in determining the fate of brain tissue after stroke.
Brain microvascular endothelial cells working in concert
with astrocytes, pericytes and neurons form a neurovascular unit (NVU). Many of these key solutes and nutrients
enter the brain by transcellular diffusion and others
through passive or active carriers that may utilize receptormediated endocytosis [3].
In stroke, loss of blood supply increases energy demand causing the nutrient and ion transporter activity
to adapt to deprived conditions. Any changes in the BBB
dynamic function resulting from altered function/expression of solute/ion transporters can worsen brain
pathophysiology in a number of neurological diseases
and disorders including stroke [6,3]. Cerebral glucose
transport and metabolic derangement during ischemia
have been observed in both animals [7] and human
studies [8]. An initial increase in glucose metabolism/
utilization occurs due to release of excitatory amino

Page 2 of 9

acids in response to ischemic insults, followed by significant reduction in glucose metabolism in the same brain
regions with consequent increase in function and expression of glucose transporters at the BBB and in brain
[9,10]. Enhanced glucose transporter levels have been
suggested to compensate for the lack of glucose availability to the brain in ischemic conditions. Several mechanisms have been suggested to substantiate the adaptive
increases in the glucose transporter expression during IR
injury. It has been shown that the regulation of GLUT1expression in ischemic brain endothelial cells can
occur through a activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase
(PI3K)/Akt pathway via vascular endothelial growth factor [11], HIF1α activation [12] etc.
Changes in BBB function due to nicotine and the components of tobacco smoke can also have significant effects on brain injury [13-16]. The observed effects of
chronic nicotine exposure on brain and BBB function
are seemingly mostly detrimental during stroke. Nicotine
has been reported to cause changes in BBB function that
include alterations in expression or function of BBBassociated proteins [17,14], cerebrovascular blood flow
[18], BBB permeability [19,13], increases in cerebrovascular thrombosis [20] and an increased post-ischemic inflammatory response [15]. Interestingly, both acute and
chronic administration of nicotine has been shown to decrease glucose transport rates across the BBB but increase
global glucose utilization in normal rat brain [21-24].
Duelli et al., (1998), have reported decreased 3-O-[14C]
methylglucose transfer across the BBB in rats infused with
nicotine for 1 week. Those investigators suggested that an
increase in local cerebral glucose utilization and reduced
glucose transfer rate is associated with an increase in
GLUT1 glucose transporter in rats pre-exposed to nicotine for one week [22,23]. Those studies utilized an in vivo
method to estimate glucose influx and efflux rate constants by injecting the radiotracer IV and analyzing radiotracer amount in blood and brain of animals at set time
points. Similar reports in humans are sparse and have
demonstrated an overall small reduction in global cerebral
glucose utilization although several brain regions showed
relative enhanced glucose utilization [25,26]. Moreover,
none of the existing studies have investigated the effects of
nicotine on glucose transport rate and expression at the
BBB during stroke. Thus, to identify an effect of nicotine
on BBB glucose transport rate during stroke, we focused
our investigations on the validation of these previous findings by utilizing the in situ brain perfusion method. This
allowed estimation of the initial rate of glucose influx
across the BBB under equilibrium conditions with no systemic interference [27]. Further, we also studied the
nicotine-induced changes in expression of GLUT1 during
stroke to help explain some of the possible nicotine and/
or smoking-related changes in cerebrovascular functions

in both normal and ischemic brain. Specifically, our
studies evaluated BBB glucose transporter function and
expression during ischemic stroke in nicotine preexposed animals.

Materials and methods
Experimental animals

All animal experimental protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas
Tech University Health Sciences Center and were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of
Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
1996). A total of 56 CD-1 male mice (Charles River
Laboratories, Inc. Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing in the
range of 25–35 gm were maintained on 12:12 h light/dark
cycle, 23° ± 1°C and used for the experimental purposes.
Nicotine treatment

For continuous nicotine infusion (4.5 mg/kg/day), nicotine ((−)-nicotine tartrate, Fisher Bioreagents) was delivered by Alzet osmotic pump (model 2004, Durect
Corporation, Cupertino, CA, USA) with an infusion rate
of 0.25 μl/h. Pumps were filled with nicotine in saline at
a concentration sufficient to deliver 4.5 mg/kg/day over
1, 7 or 14 days. A control group, the sham animals were
infused with saline-filled pumps over 14 days. Pumps
were surgically implanted under aseptic conditions. In
brief, mice were initially anesthetized with 4% isoflurane by
inhalation and subsequently maintained under anesthesia
with 1.5% isoflurane in N2O/O2 mixture (70/30) using a
SurgiVet Vaporizer (Smiths Medical North America,
Waukesha, WI, USA). Mice were placed in the prone position, skin was shaved, disinfected with betadine solution
and pumps were inserted subcutaneously by making a
small incision between the scapulae and surgically sutured
to close the incision. To prevent infection, a topical antibiotic was applied twice daily.
In vivo MCAO focal brain ischemia model

Fourteen day nicotine- or saline-infused animals were
randomly assigned for tMCAO or sham surgery. Transient MCAO was performed on mice as described previously [28,29]. Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane
by inhalation and subsequently maintained under surgical
anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane in an N2O/O2 mixture
(70/30) using a SurgiVet Vaporizer. Body temperature was
monitored with a rectal temperature probe (RET-3) and
maintained 36.5°-37°C throughout surgery using feedbackregulated thermostatic blanket and lamp (TCAT-2DF animal temperature controller, Physitemp Instruments, Inc.
Clifton, NJ, USA). In each mouse, local cerebral blood
flow (LCBF) was monitored through the skull over the left
middle cerebral artery region (MCA; 1 mm posterior and

Page 3 of 9

3 mm lateral to the Bregma) before and 5 min after occlusion of the MCA, and immediately before and ~15 min
after reperfusion using a laser Doppler monitor with needle probe (moorLAB, Moor Instruments, Wilmington,
DE, USA). Surgery was performed using a Zeiss OPMI
Pico I (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) surgical microscope. In brief, a midline incision on the ventral side of
the neck was made after aseptic preparation of the surgical
site using a skin disinfectant, betadine. The left carotid bifurcation was accessed and branches of the external carotid artery (ECA), occipital and superior thyroid arteries,
were exposed, electrocoagulated (ME102, KLSMartin
group, Tuttlingen, Germany) and cut. The left common
(CCA) and internal (ICA) carotid arteries were carefully
separated from the adjacent tissue and the vagus nerve.
The CCA and ICA were clamped using a temporary
atraumatic clip, the left ECA was electrocoagulated distally
and ligated proximal to the CCA bifurcation using silk suture. A 6-O nylon monofilament suture with a rounded
tip (0.18-0.20 mm) was introduced into the CCA by making a small incision just above the ligation on ECA and secured by tightening the silk suture. The ECA was cut
distally from the coagulated area and the nylon filament
was pulled back and a temporary ICA clip was removed
and the filament was inserted into the ICA through the
ECA stump and gently moved forward (8.5-9 mm) towards the origin of the MCA followed by removal of the
temporary clip from the CCA. A successful MCA occlusion was documented by a sudden fall in local CBF to ≤
25% of baseline within 5 min of filament insertion and the
nylon filament was secured in the place by ligation. After
60 min of MCAO, the mice were reperfused for 24 h by
withdrawing the filament and ligating the ECA below the
incision. The recovery of local CBF in the MCA regions
was observed ~15 min after reperfusion. After successful
reperfusion, the incision was sutured and animals placed
in a temperature-controlled cage for 2 h and observed for
recovery. Sham operated animals underwent the same
procedure but without MCA occlusion. After 24 h of reperfusion, a group of tMCAO (n = 5-6) or sham (n = 5-6)
animals was used for subsequent in situ brain perfusion,
and an additional group was prepared for immunohistochemistry (n = 4-5).
In situ brain perfusion

After 24 h reperfusion, the transport of glucose across
the BBB was measured using the in situ brain perfusion
technique as described previously [27]. Briefly, CD-1
mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of ketamine–xylazine (140–8 mg/kg). The left external
carotid artery, superior thyroid arteries and occipital artery were electrocoagulated. The left common carotid
was ligated distally and a temporary atraumatic clip was
placed proximal to the bifurcation. A small incision was

Shah et al. Fluids and Barriers of the CNS (2015) 12:10

Page 4 of 9

created in the CCA above the ligation and the catheter
(PE-10) tubing filled with heparin (25 units/mL) was
inserted through the incision. The tube was secured with
a suture and the vascular clip removed. The thorax and
diaphragm was cut open, the heart ventricles were cut
immediately before start of the CCA perfusion. The carotid was initially perfused (2.5 mL/min) for 30 sec with
gassed (95% O2 and 5% CO2) bicarbonate buffer containing 0.5 mM nonradiolabled D-glucose, to create
equilibrium condition and immediately with bicarbonate
buffer with [3H] D-Glucose (0.5 μCi/mL) and vascular
permeability markers [14C] sucrose (0.1 μCi/mL) for
20 sec. We pre-perfused the brain capillary bed with a
known amount of cold D-glucose to estimate glucose
kinetics under equilibration state and this minimized
possible trans-stimulation transport from varying intracellular glucose concentration [30]. We also used a
20 sec perfusion time to minimize possible back flux
and/or metabolism of D-glucose. This method allowed
us to measure precisely glucose transport across the
BBB in mice during the ischemic insult with and without
prior nicotine exposure. Buffer temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiment. At the end of
the perfusion time, mice were decapitated and the left
brain hemisphere was immediately removed and placed
on ice and weighed. Collected brain tissue was digested
in 1 mL tissue solubilizer Solvable™ (Perkin Elmer Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA) at 55°C overnight, cooled, and
mixed with 5 mL scintillation fluid. For each sample,
dual label counting was performed simultaneously in a
scintillation counter for 10 min. Vascular volume (Vv;
mL.g−1), initial transport rate (Kin; mL. sec−1. g−1), and
flux (Jin; μmol. sec−1. g−1) parameters were calculated by
the following formula as previously described [31].

for 15 min at room temperature and washed 3 times
each with PBS for 5 min. Subsequently, sections were
blocked with 5% donkey serum containing 0.3% triton
X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections
were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT1
antibody (1:300, cat no.SC-7903, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA) and vascular marker mouse
polyclonal anti-claudin-5 (1:500, cat no. 35–2500, Life

Alexa 594 (1: 1000) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488
(1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were
washed again 3 times with PBS for 5 min and slides were
air dried for 5 min. Sections were then carefully coverslipped with Prolong Gold (anti-fade with DAPI). All
specimens were then observed for immunofluorescence
using Nikon Eclipse Ti-E Epi-Fluorescence microscope
with 20X objective lens. Images were captured and mean
total fluorescence intensity was calculated for each color
channel using NIS elements AR software and GLUT1
intensity was expressed relative to claudin-5.

than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Nicotine reduces glucose transport across the BBB

We initially evaluated the glucose transport influx rate
at different time intervals after nicotine exposure in normal animals. Test group animals received 4.5 mg/kg/day
nicotine for 1, 7, or 14 days and the sham group received
saline alone. Glucose transport was estimated on day 1,
7 and 14 of nicotine exposure with [3H] D-glucose as a
substrate using in situ brain perfusion. We observed a
BBB influx rate (Kin) of 0.0026 ± 0.00069 (mL.sec−1.g−1)
in the saline infused sham group. Animals with nicotine
pre-exposure for 1, 7 and 14 days showed significantly
reduced D-glucose transport Kin across the BBB compared to the saline-infused sham group (Figure 1).

Immunohistochemistry

Mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine
(140–8 mg/kg; i.p) and were perfused intra-cardially
with ice cold PBS for 5 min and flash frozen immediately in chilled isopentane. Sections were cut at 20 μm
thick using a cryostat, collected on gold plus slides

Pre-exposure to nicotine for 14 days reduces ischemicreperfusion-enhanced glucose transport rate

In this study, we investigated the glucose transport influx rate across BBB in tMCAO animals with or without
pre-exposure to nicotine and compared these to sham
group animals with or without pre-exposure to nicotine.

In the saline-infused tMCAO group the glucose transport was significantly increased with Kin of 0.0037 ±
0.00126 (mL.sec−1.g−1) (P < 0.05) compared to salineinfused sham animals. Additionally, we observed a statistically significant (P < 0.001) decrease in glucose transport Kin of 0.0016 ± 0.00028 (mL.sec−1.g−1) across the
BBB in nicotine pre-exposed tMCAO animals compared
to the saline-infused tMCAO group. These studies suggest a nicotine regulatory effect on glucose transporter
function in both normal physiology and ischemicreperfusion conditions (Figure 2A; see Table 1.). Further,
the observed changes in glucose transport across BBB
were independent of changes in vascular volume or permeability as measured simultaneously in these experiments (Figure 2B). We did not observed a change in
vascular permeability in nicotine pre-exposed sham animals compared to saline infused sham group as measured
with vascular space marker 14[C]-sucrose in the perfusion
medium. However, we did observe increased vascular permeability with or without nicotine pre-exposed tMCAO
animals compared to saline-treated sham animals (P <
0.05) (Figure 2B).

(red-color) expression, brain sections were also colabeled with a brain vascular marker claudin-5 (greencolor) (Figure 3A). Compared to saline-infused sham
group animals, we observed a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in GLUT1 brain vascular expression in tMCAO animals and this was significantly (P < 0.01) down-regulated
to normal levels in pre-exposed nicotine tMCAO animals

(Figure 3B), consistent with that seen in the representative
immunofluorescence brain images. These observations
further suggest that the effect of nicotine pre-exposure on
glucose transport is due to changes in GLUT1 protein
levels in brain vasculature.

Discussion
In our studies, we specifically determined unidirectional
glucose transfer kinetics using an in situ brain perfusion
method. In that method, we can precisely study and
control substrate influx across the BBB since the perfusion medium is infused with a known concentration of
glucose, at a controlled infusion rate, for a defined interval of time, without any systemic interference as seen
with single intra-arterial injection in intact animals. Previously, other reports have shown that both acute and
chronic administration of nicotine decreases glucose
transport but increases glucose utilization in normal rat
brain [22,23]. Similar to previously published glucose
transporter kinetics, our data further reinforces that
nicotine reduces glucose transfer rates across the BBB
with no change or a slight increase in total vascular glucose transporter densities in nicotine-exposed sham animals. The rate of D-glucose influx in saline-infused
sham animals is also in agreement with values for unidirectional blood–brain glucose transfer obtained in our
laboratory [3] and by others in rats [23,32,33]. Our study
further confirms enhanced GLUT1 transport influx rates
and expression in ischemic mice compared to salineinfused sham animals [34]. Interestingly, in our studies,
14 day nicotine exposure before tMCAO reduced the
ischemia-enhanced glucose transport rate across the
BBB. Chronic nicotine exposure has been shown to
affect multiple transporter systems at the BBB and in
brain in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
Reduced expression of Na, K-ATPase at the BBB by
chronic nicotine administration has been demonstrated
to increase focal cerebral ischemic injury in rats [17] and
a similar trend was observed in cultured brain endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia/aglycemia with or without
nicotine and cotinine [14]. Nicotine has been shown to
dose-dependently inhibit the increased NKCC activity
observed during hypoxia/aglycemia in in vitro bovine
brain microvascular cells [14]. Moreover, nicotine exposure increased both edema and infarct volume and

worsened neurobehavioural outcomes in a 24 h permanent MCAO mouse model [16]. Importantly, the availability of glucose during and after stroke dramatically
affects ischemic outcome [35-38]. Numerous studies
examining different glucose-lowering strategies in patients with pre and post-ischemic hyperglycemia have
been summarized in a recent review [39]. These studies
indicate that tight glucose control is associated with a
major risk of severe symptomatic and asymptomatic
hypoglycemic episodes which further worsens the stroke
injury [40-45]. Perhaps, the extension of observed reduced
glucose transport in nicotine pre-exposed animals,
across the BBB under normal conditions and during ischemic reperfusion may create a more glucose deprived
state at the NVU and an exaggeration of ischemiainduced brain injury.
In this study, the direct mechanisms underlying
nicotine-induced changes in GLUT1 transporter function or expression were not determined and they will be
the focus of future studies. However, several mechanistic
investigations from our lab have shown that nicotine can
inhibit hypoxia-induced increased NKCC activity via a
PKC mediated phosphorylation pathway [46]. We have
also demonstrated an inhibitory effect of nicotine on
several PKC isoforms during hypoxic conditions in bovine
brain microvascular endothelial cells [46]. Similarly, other
in vitro studies have indicated PKC-mediated glucose
transporter activity in a variety of different tissues [47] and
retinal capillaries [48]. Specifically in endothelial cells,
PKC mediated increased glucose transport via translocation modulation has been demonstrated [49,50]. Likewise,
in human brain, PKC-mediated GLUT1 expression has
been suggested based on simultaneous changes in PKC
co-localization with changes in GLUT1 density within
endothelial domains [51]. Thus, we speculate nicotineinduced PKC changes could alter GLUT1 translocation in
endothelial cells and may explain the possible reduced glucose transfer rate in the presence of no overall change or a
slight increase in glucose transporter densities in brain capillary endothelial cells as observed in our nicotineinfused sham animals.
It is important to note that nicotine administered at
4.5 mg/kg/day for 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks through
Alzet minipumps, results in plasma levels of nicotine
of 80–100 ng/mL and the major metabolite cotinine

of >250 ng/mL, similar to a heavy smoker [16]. A study
by Abbruscato, et al., (2002) has previously demonstrated
the direct dose-dependent effects of nicotine and cotinine

on increased paracellular BBB permeability and reduced
tight junctional protein expression, using bovine brain
microvascular endothelial cells in culture, an in vitro BBB

Shah et al. Fluids and Barriers of the CNS (2015) 12:10

model. [13]. Also, others have demonstrated that plasma
levels of nicotine and cotinine equivalent to smokers
causes an increase in paracellular permeability in rats
when exposed acutely (12 hours) [52]. In contrast, other
studies have shown that a chronic nicotine dose (28 days)
of 4.5 mg/kg/day does not affect the BBB integrity measured by sucrose [53]. Similar to previous reports, our results also suggest no change in the BBB integrity in
nicotine pre-exposed animals. We calculated a glucose
transport rate (Kin) that was corrected for vascular space
measured simultaneously in the same animals. We confirmed that the observed reduced glucose transport rate in
ischemic animals was due to down-regulation of GLUT1
proteins in brain endothelial cells and not to changes in
vascular volume, further validating the observed effect of
nicotine on glucose transporter densities in brain [22].
Further, 4.5 mg/kg/day of nicotine does not affect cerebral blood flow as measured with in situ brain perfusion
using radiotracer diazepam [54]. Moreover, we believe
that glucose influx Kin is independent of blood flow
since estimated initial influx rate is relatively small compared to estimated cerebral blood flow in the mouse
under similar conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our observations validate an additional
mechanism of brain endothelial cell GLUT1 modulation
by nicotine exposure in brain during stroke. Given the
past and present clinical, and preclinical observations of
increase global cerebral glucose utilization and reduced
glucose transport in nicotine-exposed subjects, together
with our results warrants retrospective investigation of
clinical studies examining glucose regulation in acute
stroke patients with respect to tobacco use and careful
design of possible future trials aiming to control glucose
levels in the subset of ischemic and post-ischemic
patients that are smokers.
