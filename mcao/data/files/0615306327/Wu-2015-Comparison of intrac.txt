In the present study, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), induced neural stem cells (iNSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and an
immortalized cell line (RMNE6), representing different characteristics of stem cells, were transplanted into normal and/or injured brain areas
of rodent stroke models, and their effects were compared to select suitable stem cells for cell replacement stroke therapy. The rat and mice
ischaemic models were constructed using the middle cerebral artery occlusion technique. Both electrocoagulation of the artery and the
intraluminal ﬁlament technique were used. The behaviour changes and fates of grafted stem cells were determined mainly by behaviour testing
and immunocytochemistry. Following iPSC transplantation into the corpora striata of normal mice, a tumour developed in the brain. The iNSCs
survived well and migrated towards the injured area without differentiation. Although there was no tumourigenesis in the brain of normal or
ischaemic mice after the iNSCs were transplanted in the cortices, the behaviour in ischaemic mice was not improved. Upon transplanting
MSC and RMNE6 cells into ischaemic rat brains, results similar to iNSCs in mice were seen. However, transplantation of RMNE6 caused a brain
tumour. Thus, tumourigenesis and indeterminate improvement of behaviour are challenging problems encountered in stem cell therapy for stroke,
and the intrinsic characteristics of stem cells should be remodelled before transplantation. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
It is well known that injuries in the central nervous system
caused by many different disorders, including stroke, are
difﬁcult to recover from, and to date, there have been no effective therapies for stroke recovery. Using surgical decompression or thrombolytic therapy in clinical practice may
have some beneﬁt but only in the early stages after stroke
because the time window for these interventions’ efﬁcacy
is very short. As for the chronic stage of stroke, only some
supportive and symptomatic treatments are applied solely
for functional rehabilitation.1
Recently, intracerebral transplantation of stem cells has
been considered a promising approach for treating stroke.
The stem cells can continuously self-renew and differentiate
into multiple lineages, which may replace the damaged brain
areas.2,3 As a result, quite a few different stem cells, including
neural stem cells (NSCs),4,5 embryonic stem cells (ESCs),6,7

mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)8,9 and the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),10–12 are already used for treatment
of stroke lesions in animal models. The results reported from
these studies seem to be promising, showing that the grafted
cells could survive, proliferate, migrate and differentiate
into functional neurons, some of which even established
synaptic connections to the host cells. The sensorimotor
function of the model animals was also shown to be partly
improved.13,14
However, several problems are associated with using
stem cell therapy for brain injury repair, including poor
availability of the cells, immune rejection from the host
and uncertain fate in the brain after grafting, which present
obstacles for clinical use of stem cell therapy. To solve these
problems, the selection of speciﬁc and suitable stem cells
should be a primary approach for stroke treatment because
different stem cells have different characteristics.
Among stem cells that have already been tested for stroke
treatment, MSCs seem to be promising candidates. After
transplantation into the ischaemic brain of animal models,
the MSCs appeared to survive well, migrate to the injured
area and improve animal behaviour,15,16 although differentiation in the brain was very rare. Recently, other novel stem

cells have emerged and been reported to have good
prospects for neural restoration. These include iPSCs,17,18
the induced neural stem/progenitor cells (iNSCs)19,20 and a
thermally controlled immortalized γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)ergic neuronal progenitor cell line (RMNE6).21
All types were found to be, to a certain extent, capable of
overcoming the limitations and challenges in the practical
application of stem cells. It is worthwhile, therefore, to explore and compare the effects of these newly created stem
cells in conjunction with MSCs on the improvement of behaviour and neural repair of rodent stroke models following
intracerebral transplantation of the cells. Both mice and rats
were chosen as models because the cells have different origins and the xenogenic immune rejection should be avoided.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in
these animals to observe therapeutic effects. The present
study’s results, however, have not demonstrated striking curative effects in these models, indicating that the approach of
stem cell therapy for stroke needs further reﬁnement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and grouping
The animal studies were approved by the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Capital
Medical University. Adult male C57BL/6J mice weighing
25–30 g and adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
230–250 g were used for the study. The animals were
housed under a 12 h light–12-h-dark cycle with free access
to food and water.
The mice were divided into three experimental groups:
sham operation, vehicle and iNSC groups (n = 8 each). The
rats were also divided into three experimental groups: vehicle,
MSC and RMNE6 groups (n = 8 each). The transplantation or
injection was performed on the third day after MCAO.
Cell preparation
The iPSCs were from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences, and were cultured according to the
methods provided by the literature.22 The iNSCs labelled
with green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) were prepared by
the Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University.20 The
MSCs were isolated from male Sprague–Dawley rats by
adherent culture. A retrovirus plasmid, pLXSN-enhanced
GFP (eGFP), was transduced into the PT67 packaging cell
line, and the MSCs were then transfected with the conditioned medium collected from the retrovirus-producing
cell line PT67/eGFP. After being selected with G418, the
GFP-marked MSCs were cultured in α-MEM medium
(Invitrogen USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Invitrogen USA) at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2
atmosphere, passaged every 3–4 days. The medium was
changed every alternate day. The immortalized GABAergic
neuronal progenitor cell line (RMNE6)21 was created in the
Beijing Institute of Neuroscience and was treated using
the following methods. The RMNE6 line grew in the

175

DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen USA) containing 10% FBS, was
incubated in the 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator (Heraeus
Germany) and was passaged every 3 days without changing
the medium.
Focal ischaemic models
All animals were anaesthetized with 6% chloral hydrate
(6 ml kg 1, i.p.). Body temperature was maintained at
approximately 37 °C using a heating bed during the surgical
procedures. MCAO in the mice was performed by
electrocoagulation. An approximately 1-cm incision was
made on the right face between the outer canthus and the
ear. The temporal fascia and temporal muscle were bluntly
separated. The skull was opened with a dental drill and bitten away with microforceps to expand the operation ﬁeld.
The cerebral dura mater was torn off before the MCA was
fulgurized with an electrocoagulation pen. In the shamoperation group, the skulls were only opened and the middle
cerebral arteries were not coagulated.
Focal brain ischaemia in the rats was induced by the
intraluminal ﬁlament technique. A midline skin incision
was made in the neck, exposing the left common carotid
artery (CCA), external carotid artery and internal carotid
artery. A monoﬁlament nylon thread (40 mm) with a
0.34-mm-diameter tip was advanced from the left CCA bifurcation until it blocked the origin of the MCA. Following
the operation, the animals were kept warm on an electric
blanket until wake.
Transplantation procedure
The cells were dissociated with trypsin and washed with
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for three times. Any mouse
embryo ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were removed from iPSCs. The
cell density was adjusted to 1 × 105–1 × 106 μl 1 and placed
in ice to prepare for transplantation. All animals were anaesthetized with 6% chloral hydrate (6 ml kg 1, i.p.) and ﬁxed
in a stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf, USA) on the third
day after MCAO. A midline skin incision was made in the
skull with subsequent drilling for a burr hole. Cells were
then stereotaxically injected into the corresponding
positions of the normal and ischaemic mice and rats using
a Hamilton syringe (Table 1).
The injection speed was 1 μl min 1 and controlled by a syringe pump. The needle was retained in place for an additional
10 min before slowly retracting 1 mm every 3 min. The vehicle group received 0.01 M PBS using the same method.
Behavioural tests
Each animal was subjected to a series of behavioural tests at
different time points. These tests included the corner test and
cylinder test in the mice and the rotarod test in the rats.
Behavioural tests were started the day after MCAO and
were then performed on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transplantation or injection of PBS in both cell transplantation
and vehicle groups and on days 1, 10, 17, 24 and 31 after
MCAO in the sham-operation group.

Corner test
This test was carried out as described by Zhang et al.23 with
a slight modiﬁcation. The mouse was placed between two
pieces of 30 × 20-cm cardboard. The two boards were
gradually moved in from both sides to encourage the mouse
to enter a 30° corner with a small opening along the joint
between the two boards. When the mouse entered the deep
part of the corner, both sides of the vibrissae were simultaneously stimulated by the two boards. The mouse reared
forwards and upwards, then turned back to face the open
end. Twenty trials were performed for each mouse, and
the percentage of right turns was calculated. Only turns
involving full rearing along either board were recorded. This
test detected the integrated sensorimotor function, as it
involves both stimulation of the vibrissae (sensory/neglect)
and rearing (motor response).
Cylinder test
The cylinder test11 was adapted for assessing forelimb usage
and rotation asymmetry in the mouse. The mouse was
placed in a transparent cylinder 9 cm in diameter and
15 cm in height and was videotaped during the test. A mirror
was placed behind the cylinder at an angle to enable the rater
to record forelimb movements when the mouse was turned
away from the camera. After the mouse was put into the cylinder, the ﬁrst forelimb contact against the wall after rearing
and during lateral exploration was recorded using the following criteria: (1) When the forelimb ﬁrst contacted the
wall during a full rear, it was recorded as an independent
wall placement for that limb, (2) simultaneous use of both
the left and right forelimbs by contacting the wall of the cylinder during a full rear and lateral movements along the wall
were recorded as ‘both’ movement, (3) when one forelimb
(right forelimb for example) placed ﬁrst and kept contact
with the wall followed by the other forelimb (the left in this
instance), a ‘right forelimb independent’ movement and a
‘both’ movement were recorded; however, if the other
(left forelimb) made several contacting movements on the
wall, a ‘right forelimb independent’ movement and only
one ‘both’ movement were recorded, and (4) when the
mouse explored the wall laterally, alternating both forelimbs, it was recorded as a ‘both’ movement. A total of 20
movements were recorded during the 10-min test. The ﬁnal
score was determined according to a previous formula

described in the rat.10 That is, score = (A B)/(A + B + C)
(A, unimpaired forelimb movements; B, impaired forelimb
movements; C, both movements). This test evaluated
forelimb use asymmetry for weight shifting during vertical
exploration.
Rotarod test
The rotarod test was performed to evaluate the degree of
hemiparesis and coordinated movements in rats. Before
MCAO, all rats were trained to stay on an accelerating
rotarod (slowly increasing from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min)
until they could remain on the rotarod for ≥200 s. After
MCAO, the time that they could remain on the same accelerating rotarod was measured at different time points. The
data were presented as a percentage of the mean time (three
trials) on the rotarod compared with the baseline time
obtained before the MCAO.
Drawing materials and sectioning
The cell-transplanted rodents were perfused with 0.9%
physiological saline to rinse the blood and were subsequently perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to ﬁx
the brain tissue on day 28 after transplantation. The iPSCtransplanted mice underwent the same procedures on days
14 and 28 after transplantation. The brains were removed
and ﬁxed in 4% PFA again for 4–6 h and then sunk to the
bottom of 30% sucrose.
The coronal sections with a thickness of 20–30 μm from
the whole brain were cut in series with a freezing microtome
set (Leica Germany). Sections were mounted on slides and
prepared for staining with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) or
an immunohistochemical method.
HE staining
The mice’s slides were routinely stained with haematoxylin
(0.2%) and eosin (0.5%) 2 weeks after iPSC transplantation.
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
To determine whether the MCAO model was successfully
established, as well as to determine infarction location and
size, TTC staining was performed in the mice and rats that
underwent MCAO. The additional mice and rats that
underwent MCAO were anaesthetized and sacriﬁced the

day following ischaemia. The brains were removed immediately and cut into a series of 1-mm coronal slices. These
slices were stained in 2% TTC (Sigma USA) in PBS at
37 °C for 15–30 min and protected from light.
Immunohistochemical investigation
Immunohistochemical staining of neuron-speciﬁc nuclear
protein (NeuN) or glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
was performed to reveal whether the transplanted iNSCs
and MSCs predominantly differentiated into neurons or astrocytes. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to evaluate cell
viability. Double staining of Simian virus 40 (SV40)/GABA
was used to trace the immortalized GABAergic neuronal
progenitor cells (RMNE6).
From each brain, a set of 12 slices were washed with
0.3% phosphate buffered saline with Triton X-100 (PBST)
and then incubated in 3% donkey serum or 10% goat serum
in 0.3% PBST at room temperature for 1 h and then respectively incubated in mouse anti-NeuN antibody-conjugated
biotin (Chemicon Millipore USA, 1:200), rabbit anti-GFAP
antibody (Abcam UK, 1:5000), mouse anti-SV40 antibody
(Santa Cruz USA, 1:50) or rabbit anti-GABA antibody
(Sigma USA, 1:1000) with 1% donkey serum or 10% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The sections were then
washed for three times in PBS with subsequent incubation
in streptavidin–cyanine 3 (Cy3; Jackson USA, 1:400), donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson USA, 1:400), goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen USA, 1:500), goat anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen USA, 1:500) or goat anti-rabbit

177

Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen USA, 1:500) for 2–3 h. After
the sections had been washed in PBS, the nuclei were
stained by Hoechst 33258 for 10 min. Finally, the slides
were cover-slipped using mounting medium. The primary
antibody was substituted for 3% donkey serum or 10% normal goat serum in PBS in the control studies.
Statistical analysis
All behavioural data were expressed as mean ± SEM and
analysed using two-way (time and treatment) ANOVA of
repeated measures. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
MCAO model
An ischaemic area was clearly seen in the cerebral cortex of
mice and in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum of rats
after (Figure 1A and 1B) using TTC staining. The behaviour
experiments also proved that the MCAO model construction
was successful in the mice and the rats. Both corner and cylinder tests showed that the MCAO mice could develop
movement disorders. The scores in the vehicle group, in
which MCAO with injection of PBS was successful, were
higher than those in the sham group (Figure 1C and 1D).
The rotarod test showed a lack of motor coordination, indicated by a <100% for the duration of testing in all groups
(Figure 2A).

Figure 1. TTC staining: For the MCAO mouse by electrocoagulation, the white ischaemic area was located in the cerebral cortex (Figure 1A). Moreover, for
the MCAO rat by the intraluminal ﬁlament technique, the white ischaemic area was located in the cerebral cortex and the corpus striatum (Figure 1B). The
results of statistical analysis of behavioural tests indicated that the scores of the vehicle-group animals were higher than of the sham-group ones, having signiﬁcant difference in the corner test (F = 15.849, P < 0.001) and the cylinder test (F = 25.483, P < 0.001; Figure 1C, 1D)

and the cylinder test had signiﬁcant difference between the sham-operation group and the vehicle and iNSC groups, but there was no statistical difference between the vehicle group and the iNSC group. The percentages of rotational durations relative to the pre-MCAO level had no statistical difference between the
vehicle group, MSC group and RMNE6 group in the rotarod test. *P < 0.05 versus the vehicle group. **P < 0.05 versus the iNSC group

Animal survival after transplantation
In the MCAO model by electrocoagulation, the rate of survival of the mice is almost 100% 3 days after cerebral ischaemia. Moreover, the rate of survival of the normal and
the model mice is also almost 100% after cell transplantation. However, the ischaemic mice by intraluminal ﬁlament
technique can hardly survive until the third day on which
cell transplantation is performed.
In the model rats by intraluminal ﬁlament technique, the
rate of survival can reach to the above 50% on the third
day after cerebral ischaemia. However, 0.5–1% rats can survive till the forth week after cell transplantation.
Behaviour alternation
A signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) in behavioural alternations was observed between the sham-operation group and
both the vehicle group and the iNSC group. There was no
statistical difference, however, between the vehicle group
and the iNSC group (P > 0.05) in either the corner or
cylinder tests (Figure 2B and 2C) nor was any difference
noted among the vehicle, MSC and RMNE6 groups in the
rotarod test (P > 0.05; Figure 2A). Therefore, cell transplantation in the present study seemed to have no signiﬁcant
effects on behavioural improvement in the MCAO animals.
Cell survival and migration
The three cell types (iNSCs, MSCs and RMNE6) survived
well in the ischaemic brain after being implanted at the boundary zone adjacent to the ischaemic core (Figures 3A–F, 4A–C
and 5A–C). The implanted iNSCs were densely distributed in
the injected area, showing fusiform, triangular or quadrilateral shapes without obvious slender processes. The MSCs
appeared spherical, ovoid and fusiform and had no developed processes. The RMNE6 cells were mainly fusiform,
some of which tapered at both ends. Certain iNSCs and
MSCs could clearly be seen migrating to the ischaemic area
(Figures 3A and 4A), and the MSCs were especially found in
the necrotic cavity and the necrosis area (Figure 4C). The
iPSCs also survived in the corpus striatum of the normal
mice. These cells with deeply stained nuclei were circular
or elliptical with pale cytoplasm. The whole cell was strongly
basophilic, and some cells were in the mitotic phase

(Figure 6A–C). The iNSCs also survived in the cortex of
the normal mice (Figure 3G–I and 3J–L), although their
number was much greater in the ischaemic cortex (Figure 3A
and 3D) than in the normal cortex.
Cell differentiation
After transplantation of the GFP-marked iNSCs in the cerebral cortex of the normal mouse, few GFP/NeuN doublepositive cells were seen in the normal cortex. A large part of
the whole green cell was occupied by the oval, red, NeuNpositive nuclei marked with blue Hoechst 33258 so that the
entire cell was yellow or nearly white (Figure 3G–I). There
were no GFP/GFAP double-positive cells in the cerebral cortex of the normal mouse (Figure 3J–L). For those cells
transplanted into the ischaemic brain, neither GFP/NeuN
nor GFP/GFAP double-positive cells were found in the
grafted area (Figure 3A–C and 3D–F).
Cellular differentiation of GFP-marked MSCs transplanted
in the infarct area of the rats, reﬂected by the presence of
double-labelled NeuN or GFAP cells, was not seen either
(Figure 4A–C).
Tumourigenesis
Neoplasm growth was clearly seen in the brain of normal
mice after iPSC transplantation. The growing neoplasm
was prominent on the surface of the brain 4 weeks after the
iPSCs were injected in the corpus striatum (Figure 6A).
The cells continuously proliferated 2 weeks after transplantation but showed limited growth in situ (Figure 6C). They
dyed deeply (Figure 6D and 6E), and some were in mitosis
(Figure 6E). Similarly, neoplasm was also seen in the
MCAO rats into which RMNE6 cells were transplanted
(Figure 6B). No macroscopic tumour cells were found in either rodent’s brains when iNSCs or MSCs were used for the
transplantation.

DISCUSSION
In this study, four different kinds of stem cells (iPSCs,
iNSCs, MSCs and RMNE6) were selected for transplantation into normal and ischaemic rodent models to explore
and compare their efﬁcacy in the treatment of cerebral

Figure 3. Survival, migration and differentiation of iNSCs. In the ischaemic cortex (A–F), the green GFP-labelled iNSCs were found near the necrotic area,
but no GFP/NeuN (A–C) and GFP/GFAP (D–F) double-positive cells were found. NeuN (G–I) and GFAP (J–L) immunoﬂuorescence staining demonstrated
that there were a few of GFP and NeuN double-positive cells (arrow) and no GFP and GFAP double-positive cells in the normal cortex (G∼L). [A, D, G and J,

ischaemia because stem cells have long been proven to have
favourable effects in treating conditions caused by stroke.2,3
These four cell types were considered the most representative for general use in cerebral grafting.
The intraluminal ﬁlament technique is more widely used;
however, the method is not applicable in the mice of this
experiment because of the high mortality rate. So, for the
MCAO model, the electrocoagulation was used in the mice
and the intraluminal ﬁlament technique was used in the rats.
From the results of TTC, cerebral ischaemia injury is successful, although the size of ischaemia was different.

Although the two methods cannot be completely equal, the
size of ischaemia has few effects on this experiment from
the point of view of the fate of the transplanted cells in the
brain. Because of the difference of the origin of these cells,
the stem cells from the same source were for allogeneic
transplantation in order to avoid immune rejection between
species.
Since iPSCs were created by Takahashi and Yamanaka in
2006/2007, there have been several studies on their use in
ischaemic brain injury therapy.10–12,17,18 The advantages of
iPSCs are their easy availability, autologous transplantation

without immune rejection and lack of ethical concerns compared with ESCs and NSCs.24 Among individual reports,
however, there has been no deﬁnitive answer on whether or
not transplantation of iPSCs results in tumourigenesis.10–12
This may be due to factors differing between studies, including differences in transplant approaches and recipients’ brain
conditions.10–12 In a study reporting the neural differentiation
of iPSCs without tumourigenesis in the ischaemic brain, the
author suggested that microenvironments in the brain might
be a potential factor for neural differentiation.12 Regardless,
iPSCs have the same high incidence of tumours as ESCs
injected in the brain25,26 because iPSCs have similar
morphological, functional and biological characteristics.17,18
That may explain why no consistent reports about the effects
of iPSCs on the behaviour of animal models with cerebral
ischaemia are currently available.10–12 In terms of cell
behaviour, however, it is unsurprising that in the present

study, the iPSCs continued to proliferate after transplantation
without exiting the cell cycle, as is consistent with other
experimental results,10,11 and that tumourigenicity should
remain a signiﬁcant obstacle for using iPSCs as the donor
cells. In fact, the original intention of this experiment is to
explore iPSCs’ effects on the stroke. However, iPSCs were
found to form tumours in the normal brain of mice. Therefore,
the iPSCs have not continued to be implanted in the ischaemic
brain.
The iNSCs were similar to iPSCs, into which terminally differentiated somatic cells were reprogrammed and converted
by several deﬁned transcription factors.19,20 Unlike iPSCs,
however, the iNSCs realized direct transdifferentiation between different germ layers without a pluripotent stage. In
a sense, these cells were more advanced than the iPSCs, especially considering their lack of tumourigenicity.19,20 After
injection into the dentate gyrus of the mouse, the iNSCs

could survive and differentiate into mature neurons and establish synaptic connections with host neurons.19,20 The
iNSCs were not oncogenic in the brain, although they were
transduced with the protooncogene c-Myc, which was also
transduced in the iPSCs.17,18 These results indicated that
the iNSCs could be a new source for cell replacement
therapy. Unfortunately, in this study, only few iNSCs
successfully differentiated into NeuN-positive cells or into
GFAP-positive astrocytes in the normal cortex. Similar ﬁndings were obtained in the ischaemic cortex. It is possible that
the neocortex does not provide a suitable environment for
differentiation of the cells compared with the dentate gyrus,
which has vigorous neurogenesis in the adult brain. It is
therefore understandable that the behaviour of the model
animals was not improved. Further study into the iNSC differentiation is needed, both in vitro and in vivo, because this
study was the ﬁrst to use iNSCs to treat ischaemic cerebral
injury.
The RMNE6 cell line is an immortalized GABAergic
neuronal progenitor cell line transduced with the SV40 T
tsA58 gene.21 The RMNE6 cells can be considered neuronal
precursor cells because they express several characteristic
markers such as nestin, β-Tub-III, Microtubule-associated
protein 2 (MAP-2) and GABA in vitro and cannot differentiate into the GFAP- positive astrocytes in vivo.21 Instead of
integrating into the host brain and replacing the lost neurons,
RMNE6 cells were expected to play a neuroprotective role
in cerebral injury, as they can spontaneously express and release many neuroprotective factors such as nerve growth
factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3,
neurotrophin-4/5, and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor.21 In the present study, however, the cells proliferated
and formed a neoplasm after being grafted in the ischaemic
brain, although they failed to form tumours in the normal rat
brain.21 This could be due both to the existence of tsA58
SV40 large tumour antigen in the RMNE6 cells and to the
difference of the ischaemic microenvironment from the
normal state in the brain.
The MSCs have historically been used to treat ischaemic
brain injury and have the most experimental data of all cells
assessed in this study. Many experiments have demonstrated
that model animal behaviour is more or less improved after
transplantation with MSCs, although cell differentiation is
rare.15,16 It has also been shown that the well-survived
MSCs and more marrow-derived cells can be seen in the
ischaemic brain area even after intravenous administration.27 The reason was ascribed to the penumbras, the area
adjacent to the ischaemic core and robust expression of developmental proteins and genes, which simulates an embryonic tissue.28,29 Certain researchers discovered that the
majority of grafted bromodeoxyuridine-labelled MSCs were
located in the ischaemic boundary zone, and some of them
could move into the adjacent striatum and cortex, double
labelled with the neuronal markers NeuN, MAP-2 and the
astrocytic marker GFAP.15,16 A possible explanation for
improved behaviour following MSC transplantation is that
these cells may play an important role in neural protection
and regeneration by releasing neurotrophic factors,30

181

inhibiting inﬂammation,31,32 decreasing apoptosis,33 promoting and strengthening endogenous neurogenesis of the
subventricular zone and subgranular zone34 and facilitating
vascular regeneration.35 Many other factors, including the
timing, administration route and cell dose of transplanted
MSCs, should be also considered. The grafted MSCs in
the present experiment unexpectedly did not show differentiation, and animal behaviour was not improved, but there
was also no tumour formation. This may be a result of a different administration route compared with that used in other
experiments in which the MSC transplantation contributed
to the functional recovery of model animals. Regardless,
the MSCs remain the most secure donor cells and the easiest
to harvest.
Although the results were not ideal, our study was the ﬁrst
to compare the outcomes of four kinds of stem cells considered representative for general use in normal and ischaemic
murine animals. To date, there has seemed to be no more
promising measure for stroke recovery than stem cell transplantation. It is conceivable, however, that there remains
much progress to be made for stem cell transplantation to
satisfactorily treat cerebral ischaemia. To improve the effect
of cell therapy, the selection of suitable stem cells needs to
be focused on.
