Abstract Cerebral edema is a serious complication associated with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Aquaporin-4
(AQP4) plays a role in generating postischemic edema after
reperfusion. Recently, ischemic postconditioning (Postcond)
has been shown to produce neuroprotective effects and reduce
brain edema in rats after cerebral I/R. It is unclear if ischemic
Postcond alleviates brain edema injury through regulation of
AQP4. In this study, middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) was induced in rats by filament insertion for 2 h
following 24-h reperfusion: ischemic Postcond treatment
was performed before reperfusion in the experimental group.
We used the wet-dry weight ratio and transmission electron
microscopy to evaluate brain edema after 24 h of reperfusion.
We used immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses to
evaluate the distribution and expression of AQP4. Ischemic
Postcond significantly reduced the water content of the brain
tissue and swelling of the astrocytic foot processes. AQP4
expression increased in the I/R and Postcond groups compared to the sham group, but it decreased in the Postcond
group compared to the I/R group. The results of our study
suggest that ischemic Postcond effectively reduces brain edema after reperfusion by inhibiting AQP4 expression. The data
in this study support the use of ischemic Postcond for alleviating brain edema after cerebral I/R.

Highlights Ischemic postconditioning decreased brain edema.
Ischemic postconditioning reduced the swelling of astrocytic foot
processes.
Ischemic postconditioning inhibited the over-expression of aquaporin-4.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Extensive edema is triggered after an ischemic insult, and
cerebral edema is a serious complication of cerebral ischemia
(Bounds et al. 1981; Steiner et al. 2001). Cerebral edema can
lead to acute intracranial hypertension, worsened headache,
changes in vital signs including coma, or severe lifethreatening herniation. Cerebral edema is believed to be the
most common cause of neurological deterioration and mortality during acute cerebral ischemia (Vakili et al. 2011).
Alleviating this cerebral edema could reduce the neurological
deficits and improve the recovery in ischemic stroke patients.
However, brain edema is often long-lasting and resistant to
therapy, which poses a major challenge in its treatment.
Current clinical options for treating cerebral edema are limited
to hyperosmolar agents and surgical decompression.
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) belongs to a large family of membrane proteins that promote the transmembrane diffusion of
water. AQP4 is involved in cerebral edema and water homeostasis (Sobue et al. 2006). AQP4 is abundant and widely distributed in the brain, and it is expressed in astrocytic extensions close to capillaries; it helps water pass through the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Increasing evidence shows that
AQP4 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cerebral
edema. AQP4 null mice are protected from cytotoxic brain
edema in early focal cerebral ischemia (Manley et al. 2000)
and global cerebral ischemia (Katada et al. 2014). Further,
AQP4 inhibition significantly decreased the volume of brain
edema associated with ischemic injury (Igarashi et al. 2011).

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:722–729

Therefore, modulating AQP4 expression in the brain may
support a new therapeutic strategy for reducing cerebral edema induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).
Ischemic postconditioning (Postcond) includes a series of
brief, nonfatal ischemia and reperfusion cycles that are applied
in the early phase of reperfusion of an ischemic organ. This
procedure induces tolerance of the organ against long-term
ischemic injury. Zhao et al. (2006) first reported that the neuroprotective effects of ischemic Postcond alleviated I/R injury,
and other studies have reported similar findings (Wang et al.
2008; Xing et al. 2008; Pignataro et al. 2008; Joo et al. 2013;
Rybnikova et al. 2012). Recently, it was reported that ischemic
Postcond reduced brain edema after cerebral ischemia (Ren
et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2012; Han et al. 2014), but its mechanism
remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated whether
ischemic Postcond could reduce cerebral edema through inhibition of AQP4 expression after focal cerebral I/R.

Materials and Methods
Animal Groups and Cerebral I/R Model
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 to 280 g) were obtained
from the Experimental Animal Center of China Medical
University. The rats were allowed free access to water and
laboratory chow before experimentation. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of China Medical University and were performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Rats were randomly divided into a sham-operated control
group (n=21), an I/R group (n=21), and an ischemic Postcond
group (n=21). The rats in both the I/R and the ischemic
Postcond groups were subjected to 2 h of focal cerebral ischemia: the rats in the ischemic Postcond group were subjected to
three cycles of 30-s reperfusion/30-s occlusion (Robin et al.
2011) at the beginning of reperfusion. The rats were killed
after 24 h of reperfusion. Animals with evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage on extraction of brain tissue were excluded
from the study.
We chose transient focal ischemia as the intraluminal vascular occlusion method, which has been previously described,
with minor modifications (Longa et al. 1989). Rats were anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). The temperature of each rat was monitored with a rectal
probe and maintained at 37±0.5 °C with a heating pad and
lamp throughout the entire procedure. Briefly, the right common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery, and the external
carotid artery were exposed through a midline incision of the
neck. A 4-0 monofilament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio
Biotech Co. Ltd.) with a rounded tip was inserted into the

723

internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery
stump and gently advanced to occlude the middle cerebral
artery (MCA). After 2 h of MCA occlusion (MCAO), the
suture was removed to restore blood flow; this reperfusion
was confirmed by laser Doppler. Sham-operated rats were
manipulated in the same manner, but the MCA was not occluded. After the procedures, animals were placed in a cage to
recover from anesthesia at room temperature and allowed food
and drink. All surgical procedures were performed under an
operating stereomicroscope.
Infarct Size Measurement
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were killed and
the brains were excised. Brains (n=6 for each group) were cut
into 2-mm-thick coronal sections in a cutting block and
stained with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC,
Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by overnight immersion
in 10 % formalin. The infarct tissue remained unstained
(white), and normal tissue was stained red. The lesion volume
was calculated by multiplying the infarct tissue area by the
thickness of slices. We adopted a previously described method
to eliminate the contribution of edema to the ischemic lesion,
which is described by the following formula: corrected infarct
volume=contralateral hemisphere volume−(ipsilateral hemisphere volume−measured infarct volume) (Tsubokawa et al.
2007). The infarct volume was presented as the percentage of
infarct as part of the total brain area.
Sample Collection and Processing
The rats were killed after 24-h reperfusion, and the brains were
quickly removed in order to collect the cerebral cortex. The
cerebral cortex was used for measuring Western blotting and
immunohistochemistry assay. A 3-mm coronal section 5 mm
from the frontal pole was removed from the area perfused by
the MCA (Williams et al. 2004). Fresh cortical tissue was
collected from the MCA territory of the ischemic right hemisphere. The tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −70 °C until further processing.
Measurement of the Water Content of the Brain
We used the wet-dry weight method to quantify cerebral edema. The rats were killed after 24 h of reperfusion; the brain
tissue was removed, and the hemispheres were separated.
Each brain tissue sample was placed on a piece of aluminum
foil. The left and right cerebral hemispheres were weighted
independently, and the wet weights were recorded. The tissue
was then dried at 110 °C for 24 h; the samples were weighed
again, and the dry weights were recorded. The water content
was expressed using the following equation: % water=(wet

724

weight−dry weight)/wet weight×100 % (Zhan and Yang
2006).
Examination by Transmission Electron Microscopy
The rat brains were perfused with approximately 100 ml heparinized saline and fixed with approximately 200 ml 4 % paraformaldehyde. The brains were dissected out, and the frontal
and parietal areas of ischemic brain tissues were chosen as
samples. The samples were divided into 1×1×1-mm3 pieces,
which were successively fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde and
4 % paraformaldehyde for several days at 4 °C. After gradient
alcohol dehydration and epoxy 618 embedding, semithin and
ultra-thin sections were sliced and stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate. Next, changes in the pinocytotic vesicles were
examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM1200EX). All of the experimental procedures for TEM examination were completed using a double-blind method.
Immunohistochemistry Assay
Rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with heparinized
saline and 4 % paraformaldehyde. The brains were postfixed
for 24 h and then immersed for 24 h in 30 % sucrose solution
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Coronal sections at the
level of the anterior commissure in the region of the infarct
tissue were cut into 10-μm-thick sections on a cryostat at
−25 °C. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
to confirm neuronal damage after I/R. Serial sections were
obtained for further immunohistochemistry analyses. The
samples were rehydrated in PBS before immunostaining,
and endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by incubation with 3 % H2O2 solution for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking the sections with normal goat serum for
30 min, the sections were incubated with goat serum for an
additional 30 min. The sections were then incubated with
rabbit anti-AQP4 polyclonal IgG (1:600 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. A negative
control was established by exchanging the primary antibody
for PBS during the incubation. The remaining procedures
conformed to the standard procedures. For semiquantitative
measurements of AQP4 density, the slides were photographed
and analyzed using a computer-aided image analysis system
(Motic Images Advanced 3.2).

nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus at 100 V
for 2 h. The membrane was blocked with 5 % nonfat milk/
Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) (pH 7.6) for 2 h.
Next, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit
AQP4 (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rat
anti-β-actin (1:1,000 diluted; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in 1 % BSA/TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min each with TBST
buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein
bands were scanned with Chemi Imager 5500 V2.03 software.
The integrated density value (IDV) was calculated with a
computer-aided image analysis system (Fluor Chen 2.0) and
normalized with the IDV of β-actin.
Statistical Analyses
All data are expressed as means±standard deviations (SDs).
We used one-way analysis of variance and post hoc StudentNewman-Keuls test. Results were considered statistically significant with a p value <0.05.

Infarct Volumes
As shown in Fig. 1a, b, TTC staining of the cerebrum 24 h
after reperfusion revealed that three reperfusion/occlusion cycles of 30 s each performed at the onset of reperfusion

Western Blot Analysis
We used Western blot analysis to further quantify AQP4 expression. The rats were killed by decapitation after 24 h of
reperfusion, and we immediately obtained 20 μg of protein
from rat brain tissues in each experimental group. The proteins
were size-separated by 7 to 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis at 120 V for 90 min and then transferred to

decreased the cerebral infarct volumes compared with I/R
group (19.6 vs. 32.0 %, p<0.05).

Water Content of the Brains
We measured the water content of the rat brains to
evaluate cerebral edema. The water contents of the ischemic (right) hemispheres in the sham group, the I/R
group, and the ischemic Postcond group were 76.68±
0.68, 82.70 ± 1.54, and 79.82 ± 0.47 %, respectively
(Fig. 2). Ischemic Postcond treatment at the beginning
of reperfusion markedly reduced the water content of
the right hemisphere as compared to the I/R group.
The water contents of the nonischemic (left) hemispheres in the sham group, the I/R group, and the ischemic Postcond group were 76.58±0.64, 76.89±1.09,
and 76.55 ± 0.56 %, respectively (Fig. 2). The water
content of the left hemisphere did not vary significantly
among the different groups. The water content of the
right hemisphere was significantly higher than that in
the left hemisphere in the I/R group and the ischemic
Postcond group.

Ultrastructure Change of the Pericapillary Astrocytic Foot
Processes
TEM of the cerebral cortex and striatum after 24 h of reperfusion revealed widespread swelling of the pericapillary astrocytic foot processes in the I/R group. As shown in Fig. 3, the
capillary lumen decreased in diameter and the edema was
detected around the capillary. Astrocytic foot processes surrounding the capillaries appeared significantly swollen. In the
sham-operated rat brains, the ultrastructure of the BBB appeared normal and enlarged astrocytic foot processes were
not identified. The ischemic Postcond group showed less edema around the capillaries and less swelling of the astrocytic
foot processes than the I/R group.
Protein Distribution and Expression of AQP4
We included immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses of AQP4 in our study to characterize the specific role of
AQP4 in MCAO-induced brain edema. The immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that AQP4 completely
surrounded cerebral microvessels in the sham-operated, I/R,
and ischemic Postcond groups. We observed low expression
of AQP4 primarily in astrocytic foot processes around brain
vessels in the sham group. The mean optical density values of
AQP4 were significantly higher in the I/R and Postcond
groups than in the sham group. AQP4 expression was substantially lower in the ischemic Postcond group than the I/R
group (p<0.01; Fig. 4).
The protein expression levels of AQP4 in the I/R group,
which were revealed by Western blot analysis, confirmed the
effects of ischemic Postcond. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of the protein was significantly higher in the I/R and
Postcond groups than the sham group (p < 0.01; Fig. 5).
However, AQP4 expression was significantly lower in the
Postcond group than the I/R group (p<0.05; Fig. 5).

capillary lumen, microvessels with a normal appearance, and

the levels of edema in the area surrounding the capillaries were
significantly reduced compared to the I/R group. Also, in the ischemic
Postcond group, we observed regular capillary lumen and astrocytic foot
processes that were less swollen than in the I/R group. Scale bar=2 μm

Discussion

immunoreactivity and protein levels. Therefore, ischemic
Postcond might alleviate brain edema induced by I/R injury
by down-regulating the expression of AQP4.
Cerebral edema is a major consequences of cerebral I/R
(Liu et al. 2012). Two types of brain edema can occur after
brain injury such as stroke and trauma: cytotoxic edema and
vasogenic edema. Cytotoxic edema, which refers to cell swelling, is the major form in the early stage of brain edema, and it
is a significant clinical problem that can develop in response to
a large MCAO (Hacke et al. 1996; Bardutzky and Schwab
2007). We used MCAO as an effective experimental model
to induce brain edema and brain injury. According to the classification of cerebral edema on the basis of the pathophysiologic mechanism, cytotoxic edema develops within 24 h of
reperfusion (Katsuta et al. 2003; Galvão et al. 2005; Guevara
et al. 1998). Therefore, we chose 24 h of reperfusion as the
time point for evaluation in our study. After 24 h of reperfusion, we observed remarkable pathological changes in
intracelluar edema, such as swollen astrocytic foot processes
and swollen mitochondria. Astrocytes are the primary cell
type that swell in cytotoxic brain edema, especially in the
pericapillary foot processes (Kimelberg 1995). The swelling
of the cells could compress the neurons and vessels and aggravate ischemic injury. We also observed that ischemic
Postcond significantly reduced the swelling of the astrocytic
foot processes. Previous experimental studies demonstrated
correlations between neurological deficits after MCAO and
the degree of cerebral edema as measured by hemispheric
enlargement (Kondo et al. 1997). Our previous study also
showed that ischemic Postcond before reperfusion reduced
infarct volume and alleviated neurological deficits in rats with
an induced MCAO (Han et al. 2014), which is related to decreased brain edema. Reduction of the brain edema is one of
the neuroprotective mechanisms of ischemic Postcond. We
suppose that ischemic Postcond could reduce brain edema
and have protective effects for ischemic cerebral injury.
Increased AQP4 expression in astrocytes has recently been
reported in several pathologies in which cytotoxic edema is
predominant, including stroke, traumatic brain injury,

In this study, we found that brain edema induced by I/R injury
was associated with increased expression of AQP4 following
MCAO after 24 h of reperfusion. We also observed a marked
ultrastructure change in the swelling of astrocytic end feet.
These alterations were suppressed by ischemic Postcond,
which could alleviate brain edema and attenuate AQP4

meningitis, and hyponatremia (Papadopoulos and Verkman
2005). An up-regulation of the mRNA and protein expression
of AQP4 in the peri-ischemic brain tissue was also reported
(Nito et al. 2012; Zheng et al. 2008; Bhattacharya et al. 2013;
Taniguchi et al. 2000). There is also evidence of increased
synthesis of AQP4 in the peri-infarct area of the cortex after
24 h of reperfusion following MCAO (Frydenlund et al.
2006). Using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that AQP4 expression increased around
the microvessels in the cerebral I/R group and the ischemic
Postcond group after 24 h of reperfusion. Astrocytic foot processes are the predominant sites of AQP4 expression in the
brain (Rash et al. 1998; Rash and Yasumura 1999). AQP4
facilitates the transportation of water along the astrocytic
end-foot processes (King and Agre 1996). This may lead to
the formation of brain edema (Kaur et al. 2006, 2007).
Alternatively, AQP4 over-expression could induce a rapid influx of water and lead to the development of cytotoxic edema
after focal brain ischemia (Yu et al. 2005). Thus, downregulation of AQP4 expression may alleviate cerebral edema.
Pretreatment with an AQP4 inhibitor significantly reduced the
severity of brain edema associated with brain ischemia
(Igarashi et al. 2011). In a model of focal ischemic stroke
produced by MCAO, AQP4-deficient mice had decreased cerebral edema and improved neurological outcomes (Manley
et al. 2000; Yao et al. 2015). Our findings agree with these
previous reports and show that, in the ischemic Postcond
group of a rat MCAO model, AQP4 down-regulation accompanied an obvious reduction of cerebral edema. We identified
that ischemic Postcond significantly inhibited over-expression
of AQP4 after 24 h of reperfusion, which could alleviate cerebral edema after cerebral I/R.
Our study has some limitations. First, we conducted our
observations after 24 h of reperfusion because peak edema is
observed 24 h postischemia (Guéniau and Oberlander 1997).
We also focused on the formation of edema in the early stage
after cerebral I/R. Ideally, the effect of ischemic Postcond on
AQP4 should be observed at different times after cerebral
reperfusion. Possibly, ischemic Postcond treatment only leads
to a transient decrease in AQP4 expression. Second, the mechanism of the effect of ischemic Postcond is not entirely clear.
On the basis of the present study, we cannot explain the mechanism of action underlying the effect of ischemic Postcond on
AQP4 expression. The mechanism may be related to reversible protein phosphorylation. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a potential phosphorylation sites of AQP4 and water permeability
activity changes with its phosphorylation (Gunnarson et al.
2004). Direct and indirect evidence suggests that PKC is involved in AQP4 regulation. PKC activators inhibit ischemiainduced up-regulation of AQP4 (Kleindienst et al. 2006;
Fazzina et al. 2010; Bhattacharya et al. 2014). Ischemic
Postcond may reduce ischemic damage by inhibiting the
worsening effect of δPKC but promoting a beneficial effect

727

of εPKC activity (Bhattacharya et al. 2014; Fazzina et al.
2010). In the future, the effect of ischemic Postcond on
AQP4 at different times after cerebral reperfusion will need
to be evaluated and the mechanisms in vitro and in vivo will
need to be clarified.

Conclusions
This study showed that ischemic Postcond alleviated swelling
in the astrocytic foot processes surrounding brain capillaries
and reduced damage from edema in a rat model of MCAO.
Also, ischemic Postcond inhibited the over-expression of
AQP4 in the ischemic cerebral penumbra, which suggests that
ischemic Postcond alleviates the brain edema through the
down-regulation of AQP4 expression in the early stages of
the formation of brain edema after reperfusion. The reduction
of brain edema may be a neuroprotective effect of ischemic
Postcond achieved through alterations of AQP4 expression.
That is, the neuroprotective effects of ischemic Postcond may
result, in part, from its anti-AQP4 mechanisms. The data from
the present study support ischemic Postcond treatment as a
new approach for stroke therapy.
