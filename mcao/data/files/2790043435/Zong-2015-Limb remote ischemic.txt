Abstract 
Background:  Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) can ameliorate cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
(IRI), while the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is an important transcription factor during cerebral ischemia damage. However, whether the neuroprotective effect of LRIP could be associated with HIF-1α is somewhat unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that Limb remote ischemic postconditioning
(LRIP) protecting brain from injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was associated with HIF-1α
expression.
Results:  LRIP was conducted with 3 cycles of 10 min occlusion/10 min reperfusion at the beginning of reperfusion.
The analysis of neurobehavioral function and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed the neurological
deficit, brain infarct and cerebral edema, caused by ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), were dramatically ameliorated
in LRIP administrated animals. Meanwhile, the result of Q-PCR and western blot revealed that the overexpression of
HIF-1α induced by IRI could be notably suppressed by LRIP treatment.
Conclusions:  LRIP exhibits a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the possible mechanism is
associated with the suppression of HIF-1α in stroke rats.

Background
Cerebral ischemia, the most common acute cerebrovascular disease, has been recognized as the third leading
cause of mortality and disability in the worldwide. Up to
date, few effective therapies could be used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Therefore, it is necessary to
develop new methods for the treatment of brain ischemia
and the involved mechanism should be investigated.
LRIP is designated as an emerging and developed postconditioning procedure, induced by repeated occlusion/

reperfusion cycles in the bilateral femoral arteries. Previous studies have demonstrated that LRIP could effectively improve outcome in ischemic animal models [1–3],
therefore possessing potential neuroprotection in alleviating brain edema, reducing cerebral infarct volume and
blood–brain barrier disruption [4–6]. As a result, LRIP
could be considered as an effective therapy for brain
ischemia in future clinic practice. However, the potential
protective mechanisms of LRIP are waiting to be clarified. HIF-1α, a primary component of the cellular and
systemic response to hypoxia in mammals, consists of an
oxygen-regulated α-subunit and a constitutive β-subunit
[7]. As a master transcriptional regulator of numerous
genes under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α not only participates in regulating angiogenesis, glucose metabolism and
cell survival during hypoxia [8–10], but also plays a crucial role in the development of apoptosis, inflammation

activity [11–14]. Although HIF-1α has been widely
known to be upregulated in rats subjected to cerebral
ischemia, but the exact role of HIF-1α is still being
debated. Moreover, no evidence is to address the role of
HIF-1α in brain ischemia rats subjected to LRIP. In this
study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of LRIP
using MCAO rat model, indicated by neurological deficit score, infarct volume and brain edema. Then, using
the analysis of Q-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, we detected whether HIF-1α was involved in
ischemic brain subjected to LRIP.

Methods
Animals and grouping

All SPF grade Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–280 g,
were purchased from animal center of Sichuan University
and the experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Chengdu
Medical College. At room temperature (22–25  °C), all
rats were housed in a plastic cages (2 rats per cage) with
12-h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and
water. All rats were randomly divided into three groups:
sham, I/R and LRIP groups. The rats in sham group were
subjected to surgical operation without occlusion of the
right middle cerebral artery and LRIP treatment. The rats
in I/R group were only suffered MCAO injury without
LRIP treatment. The rats in LRIP group were subjected
to MCAO group with LRIP treatment. Based on the reperfusion time, I/R and LRIP groups were respectively
divided into following subgroups, including reperfusion
1, 3 and 7 days groups.
Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion

Transient MCAO, as previously described [15], was used
to induce focal cerebral ischemia. Rats were anesthetized
deeply by injection of 3.6 % chloral hydrate (1 ml/100 g,
IP). Heating lamps were used to maintain temperature at
36–37.5  °C. To perform brain ischemia, a midline neck
incision in the neck was prepared. Then, the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA)
and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed and isolated surgically. After the CCA was ligated close to its
origin with a 3-0 silk suture, a type of 4.0 monofilament
nylon suture with a slightly enlarged and rounded tip
(Doccol Cooperation, Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted
into the ICA,and advanced 18–20 mm until mild resistance, which indicated the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was effectively occluded. After 60  min of MCAO, the
monofilament nylon suture was removed and MCA
perfusion was restored. The sham group underwent
the same procedure, but without occlusion of the right
MCA. In limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP)
group, LRIP was conducted at the beginning of MCAO

reperfusion. Briefly, the proximal hind limbs of each rat
were tightened with rubber bands for 10 min as tight as
possible, and then the rubber bands were loosened for
10  min. This process was repeated 3 cycles. The blood
flow was completely interdicted and was confirmed
by hypothermia, cyanosis and expansion in the hind
limbs. When the procedures were finished, the animals
returned to their cages and again allowed free access to
food and water.
Assessment of neurological function

The neurological deficit score (NDS) was performed with
double-blind fashion at 24 h after IRI injury. To assure the
brain damage in a similar degree as much as possible, the
1–2 scores animals according to the methods of Longa
scoring [16] were included in the following experimental
procedure. The method of Longa scoring is listed as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, failure to extend left forepaw fully;
2, circling to the left; 3, falling to the left; and 4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness.
The final neurobehavioral scoring in this study was performed according to Garcia JH [15], which contains six
aspects: spontaneous activity (in case for 5 min); symmetry
of movements (four limbs); symmetry of forelimbs (outstretching while held by tail); climbing wall of wire cage;
reaction to touch on either side of trunk; response to vibrissae touch. Each aspects contain 0–3 points. The total scores
range 3 from 18. The severity worsens as scores decreased.
Measurement of infarct volumes and cerebral edema

The infarct volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) staining as described previously [17]. Three days after reperfusion, the brains were
removed and cut into 4-mm-thick coronal sections,
then the slices were incubated in 0.2 % solution of TTC
diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
(pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min and immersed overnight in
10  % formalin. The white color represented infarct tissue and red was normal tissue. The sections were photographed using a digital camera (Olympus, Japan). The
infarct zone was demarcated and analyzed with Image J
software (IPP, version 6.0). The ratio of infarct to normal
volume was calculated as follows: [(area of the cortex in
the non-ischemic hemisphere—area of the normal cortex
in the ischemic hemisphere)/area of the non-ischemic
cortex]  ×  100  % [2, 18]. Cerebral edema was counted
from sections stained by TTC according to the formula:
[(ipsilateral volume − contralateral volume)/contralateral
volume] × 100 % [19].
Quantitative RT‑PCR analysis

According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the
total RNA of infarcted area was isolated by Trizol

reagent (Invitrogen, USA), and then was transcripted
to cDNA reversedly with the RevertAidTM First Strand
cDNA Synthesis kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian,
China). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for the level of
HIF-1α mRNA was performed by using Prime Script
RT-PCR kits (Takara) as described. The mRNA level
of β-actin was as an internal control. The sequences
of primers used were shown as following: (forward)
5′-ACCCTCTGATTTAGCATGTAG-3′ and (reverse)
5′-GTAGGTTTCTGCTGCCTTGT-3′) for HIF-1α; (forward) 5′-GAAGATCAAGATCATTGCTCCT-3′ and
(reverse) 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCA-3′) for
β-actin. The real-time PCR program steps were 95 °C for
1 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C
for 20 s.

To compare the positive cell number, six fields from per
section were captured and analyzed.
For immunofluorescence, sections were pretreated
with previously, then incubated in the mixture of antiHIF-1α antibody/anti-GFAP(mouse, 1:200, Proteintech), anti-HIF-1α antibody (rabbit, Abcam, 1:50)/
anti-NeuN (mouse, 1:200, Abcam), After washed with
PBS, they were incubated with fluorescence secondary
antibody IgG (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated,
green, 1:100, Proteintech)/IgG (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated, red, 1:100, Proteintech) for 2 h at 37 °C.
Then, the sections were rinsed with PBS and mounted by
DAPI. Finally, the pictures were captured by fluorescence
microscope (Olympus/BX51, Tokyo, Japan) at  400×
magnification.

Western blot

Statistical analysis

Brain tissues from infarct cortex were lysed and homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China)
supplied with 2 % of cocktail pill (Roche). Then suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 r/min for 10  min. And
protein concentration was qualified with the BCA assay
kit (Beyotime). 80 ug total protein was separated in 15 %
SDS–polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) at 80 V for 2 h and
transferred to PVDF membranes at 350 mA for another
2 h as well as was blocked with 5 % nonfat milk dissolved
by TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the blocked
membranes were incubated overnight at 4  °C with the
primary antibody of HIF-1α (rabbit, Abcam, 1:1000).
After incubated with the primary antibody, the membranes were rinsed with TBST and incubated with the
secondary antibody for 2 h (goat anti-rabbit IgG, ZSGBBIO, China, 1:5000). Finally, ECL was added to membranes to develop image, which was conducted in Alpha
Innotech (Bio-Rad).

All data expressed as the mean  ±  standard error of the
mean (S.E.M.). Differences in quantitative data obtained
from cerebral infarct area, brain edema, NDS, integrated
densities of protein bands and immunohistochemical, the
expression of genes were evaluated by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s t test, p  <  0.05 was
considered as statistical significance. Statistical analysis
was performed with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS
Corp, USA).

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

For immunohistochemistry, brains tissues from each
group were harvested, post-fixed with 4  % paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Then, coronal sections  (10 µm) were achieved at the level of the anterior
commissure. When paraffin was removed, sections
were incubated in 0.3 % H2O2 for 10 min. Then the sections were disposed with high pressure antigen retrieval
for 2 min and blocked with 5 % goat serum at 37 °C for
20 min. Subsequently, they were incubated in the mixture
of anti-HIF-1α antibody (rabbit, Abcam, 1:50) overnight
at 4  °C. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with corresponding secondary antibody at 37  °C
for 40  min. Finally, the antibody was visualized using
DAB staining, then counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, mounted, observed with a light microscope
(Olympus/BX51, Tokyo, Japan) at  400× magnification.

Results
Effect of LRIP improving neurological function

As shown in Fig.  1 (each group: n  =  8), Garcia scores
at different time in sham group were about 18, which
indicated that there was no neurological deficit. Comparatively, after undergoing cerebral ischemia, the rats
presented severity neurological deficit. At each time
point of reperfusion, the Garcia scores in I/R group were
lower than sham group (p  <  0.05, Fig.  1). Moreover, the
scores were notably increased compared with I/R group
but it was still lower than sham group, when treated with
LRIP (p  <  0.05, Fig.  1). These confirmed that cerebral
ischemia injury had resulted in neurological dysfunction,
while LRIP treatment could inhibit this injured progress.
These findings showed that the postconditioning treatment could improve the neurological function caused by
MCAO injury.
LRIP reduced cerebral infarct volume and suppressed
cerebral edema

To investigate whether LRIP could reduce infarct volume and cerebral edema in ischemic brain, we measured
infarct volume and brain edema with TTC staining at 3d
reperfusion (Fig.  2a). White zone in brain tissues represented damaged brain areas resulted from ischemia, and
red zone represented normal brain tissues. Rats in sham

Garcia scores in different groups at day 1, 3 and 7. Compared with in
sham group, the Garcia scores were obviously lower in I/R and LRIP
group at day 1, 3 and 7 (#p < 0.05). Whereas, the LRIP administration
could ameliorate the neurological function, indicated by increase
of scores in LRIP group more than I/R group (*p < 0.05). The data is
presented as mean ± SEM from eight animals per group

group had no ischemic damage, showing red staining
(Fig. 2a). I/R group exhibited that cerebral infarct volume
was about 32.20  ±  2.16  %, whereas the LRIP decreased
the white zone to 21.87 ± 1.98 % (p < 0.05; n = 5; Fig. 2b).
Therefore, brain edema (%) was significantly reduced
in LRIP group compared with I/R group. These result
confirmed that LRIP treatment significantly decreased
infarct volume and brain edema during cerebral ischemia
injury.

The activation and localization of HIF‑1α

In this study, we tested the activation and distribution of
HIF-1α in cerebral cortex by using immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig.  3, immunofluorescence confirmed
that HIF-1α was mainly located in cytoplasm of neurons,
but few in astrocytes, while ischemia injury could induce
HIF-1α increase. In sham group, we showed that HIF-1α
exhibited a basic expression in cortex of brain. After
ischemia–reperfusion, the number of HIF-1α positive
neurons was significantly increased at each time point
(p  <  0.05; Fig.  4). Moreover, LRIP treatment decreased
effectively the number of HIF-1α positive neurons and
exhibited statistic significance at 1 and 3 days (p < 0.01;
Fig.  4). These showed that ischemic postconditioning could suppress the expression of HIF-1α in neurons
under ischemia condition.
Expression of HIF‑1α mRNA

We determined the mRNA level of HIF-1α in the injured
brain tissues at day 1, 3 and 7. Q-PCR showed that the
expression of HIF-1α had a significant rising after
ischemia and hypoxia (Fig. 5a). At day 1, the mRNA level

of HIF-1α in I/R group was higher than seen in sham
group (p < 0.05, Fig. 5a). However, LRIP treatment could
partly reverse this alteration that mRNA expression
of HIF-1α in LRIP group was significantly decreased at
1  day compared with in I/R group (p  <  0.05). At 3  days
and 7 days post operation, the expression of HIF-1α was
gradually reduced in I/R group compared with sham
group (p  <  0.05), but there was no statistical change
between I/R group and LRIP group (p  >  0.05, Fig.  5a;
n = 5).
Level of HIF‑1α protein

The protein expression of HIF-1α at 3  days was measured by western blot. As shown in Fig.  5b, the density of protein bands in sham, I/R and LRIP group was
0.51 ± 0.07, 1.13 ± 0.11, 0.82 ± 0.09, respectively. Compared with sham group, the expression of HIF-1α in I/R
was increased significantly (p < 0.05, n = 5). However, in
LRIP treated animals, the protein expression of HIF-1α
was notably decreased (p  <  0.05, n  =  5). The result
demonstrated that LRIP treatment could suppress the

Discussion
In this study, we found LRIP had the neuroprotective
effect in brain ischemia rats, and the possible molecular
mechanism is involving in the change of HIF-1α. Currently, focal ischemia induced by MCAO, which has
been widely applied to research the effects and mechanisms of pre- and postconditioning on focal cerebral
ischemia in the experiment animals. As a newly developed postconditioning procedure, LRIP was conducted
immediately after focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion establishment with three cycles of 10  min banding
or loosing. As a result, an efficacious neuroprotection
against brain ischemic injury was observed indicated by
Garcia JH scores in LRIP administrated rats. TTC staining revealed that LRIP significantly reduced the cerebral
infarct volume and relieved brain edema, which showed
that LRIP could decrease cell death in ischemic area. Our

the quantitative analysis. LRIP suppressed the protein level of HIF-1α (#p < 0.05), which was upregulated by cerebral ischemia injury (*p < 0.05)

observation added the fruitful evidence that was supported by previous reports [4, 20].
Possible mechanisms underlying the protective effect
of LRIP may include amelioration of endothelial function, guarding the integrity of the blood brain barrier,
modulation protein synthesis and nerve activity [2, 21],
inhibition of apoptosis [22] and a decrease of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [5]. Recently, accumulating experiments focused on inflammatory interactions following
brain ischemia, which were closely related to the pathogenesis of brain injury and might critically determine
the outcome and prognosis of brain ischemia [23–25].
It has been reported that LRIP treatment could decrease
expression of inflammation mediators interleukin-1beta
(IL-1β) and IL-6, while they are important for neuroprotection under LRIP condition [26]. In our experimental
model, LRIP exhibits significant neuroprotection in brain
ischemia rats, and the molecular mechanism should
involve the modulation of HIF-1α.
HIF-1α is a critical regulator contributing to adaptive
responses to hypoxia, and HIF-1α can regulate cellular
transductions under hypoxic milieu and inflammatory
conditions [27–29]. During cerebral ischemic injury,
HIF-1α was upregulated which may be involved in inflammation processes. Evidence showed that HIF-1α administration could regulate glycolytic capacity in myeloid
cell to reduce myeloid infiltration to affect inflammatory progression. Suppression of HIF-1α in macrophages
and neutrophils may result in inhibition of inflammatory
reaction [30]. Whereas, HIF-1α deficiency may reduce

the expression of tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α),
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels in the ileal mucosa after
trauma hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) [31], which might
eventually contribute to structural and functional recovery. Literature showed that HIF-1α could regulate the
expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to
affect inflammatory response during the ischemic phase of
shock [32]. In addition, HIF-1α could significantly upregulate TNF-α to progress inflammatory response in the sepsis process formation and alveolar macrophages activated
by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [33]. By increasing the oxygen-dependent expression of T cell immunoglobulin and
mucin domain protein (TIM)-3 in glial cells, HIF-1α could
indirectly influence the infiltration of neutrophils into the
hypoxic penumbra, which was regarded as a main cause of
ischemic brain damage [34]. Therefore, HIF-1α is a crucial
molecule in inflammatory response progress.
In our study, overexpression of HIF-1α was induced
by IRI, while it was markedly attenuated in LRIP group
during early cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the inhibition of HIF-1α may be critical mechanism for neuroprotection induced by LRIP. The present finding revealed
LRIP exhibiting a neuroprotective role was related with
the inhibition of HIF-1α, a critical inflammation mediator during brain ischemia. Additionally, inhibition of
HIF-1α in LRIP may have other effects. As Liu BN [35]
and Pichiule P [36] reported, HIF-1α could inhibit apoptosis pathway and improve angiogenesis in infarcted area
via regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),

Zong et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:97

cleaving caspase-9 and erythropoietin (Epo). In our
study, the expression of HIF-1α was markedly decreased
in LRIP administration rats, which was associated with
the improvement of neurological function, reduction of
infarct size and brain edema. Therefore, we deduced that
LRIP in MCAO rat model should be an effective method
for the treatment of brain ischemia and the molecular
events were possibly associated with the downregulation
of HIF-1α expression.

Conclusions
LRIP can significantly reduce cerebral damage caused by
IRI, and the mechanisms are related to inhibiting the overexpression of HIF-1α to suppress inflammatory response.
These available findings not only confirm the neuroprotective effect of LRIP, but also provide new information
to understand the role of HIF-1α as a novel target for the
treatment of brain ischemia in future clinic practice.
