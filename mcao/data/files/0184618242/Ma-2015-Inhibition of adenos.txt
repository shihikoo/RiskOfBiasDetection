Introduction

Stroke is the leading cause of death in China, and results in
substantial healthcare expenditures (Zhao et al., 2008). An
important pathophysiological mechanism of ischemic stroke
is cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) that involves a
complex sequence of events, including neuronal energy
dysmetabolism, excitatory amino acid toxicity, Ca2þ overload,
n

oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and initiation of the apoptotic
cascade. The cascade reactions affect not only neurons but
also glial cells in the brain (Zhao et al., 2011). Astrocytes are the
most abundant brain cells, and in addition to their important
homeostatic role, they organize structural architecture of the
brain and modulate neuronal plasticity (Barreto et al., 2011). In
addition, astrocytes and microglias are regarded as immune
active cells, and in some instances, they share common immune

responses (Jeong et al., 2012; Verkhratsky, 2010). Astrocyte, microglia, neuron, and endothelial cells constitute the neurovascular
unit (Zlokovic, 2008), which is the basic structural and functional
unit of the nervous system (Jung et al., 2010). Because astrocytes
and microglias play an important role in cerebral I/RI (Burnstock,
2008), a promising therapeutic strategy could include targeting
astrocytes and microglia cells in the brain. Ischemic stroke
represents a state of severe energy deﬁciency. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can act as a critical
sensor of cellular energy balance (Hardie and Ashford, 2014).
Regulation of AMPK activity is important for neuroprotection after
cerebral I/RI (Ronnett et al., 2009; Yvsvpjan et al., 2011). AMPK is a
serine/threonine protein kinase that consists of a catalytic αsubunit (α1 or α2), and regulatory β- and γ-subunits (β1, β2, γ1, γ2,
and γ3) (Weisová et al., 2011). AMPK is abundantly expressed in
various cells of the body, including neurons, glial cells, and
vascular endothelial cells in the central nervous system (Li and
McCullough, 2010; Zou and Wu, 2008). Furthermore, AMPK is
activated via Thr172 phosphorylation in the α-subunit (Oakhill
et al., 2011), and is an evolutionarily conserved cellular energy
sensor that plays a vital role in physiological and pathological
conditions (Ge et al., 2011; Guo and Ren, 2012; Mao and Klionsky,
2011). In the central nervous system, AMPK participates in
neuroprotection (Poels et al., 2009), and prior studies have
reported that AMPK activation contributed to neuronal death
induced by glutamate oxidative toxicity. ADT-OH [5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiocyclopentene-3-thione] derivative ADT, protected neurons from oxidative toxicity by suppressing AMPK
activation (Jia et al., 2013). AMPK has been found to play an essential role in regulating neuronal apoptosis (Li et al., 2010;
Weisová et al., 2011). Previous studies reported that when human
neuronal cells were treated with Aβ1–42 for 24 h, pAMPK levels as
well as signs of oxidative stress increased, and neuronal cell death
was induced (Kwon et al., 2010). Treatment of these cells with the
antioxidant melatonin reduced AMPK phosphorylation and attenuated Aβ1–42-induced oxidative stress (Axelsen et al., 2011;
Bonnefont-Rousselot and Collin, 2010; Galano et al., 2011). AMPK
activation markedly exacerbated brain damage, whereas AMPK
inhibition provided sustained neuroprotection after a stroke (Li
et al., 2007). Manipulating the neuronal energy metabolism by
altering AMPK activity may therefore provide neuroprotection
after ischemia (Li et al., 2010). AMPK activation contributed to
neuronal death under pathological conditions, such as during
stroke. However, AMPK inhibition protected neurons (Venna et al.,
2012). AMPK studies focusing on neurons and the effects on glial
cells are often ignored, suggesting that manipulation of this
system may present opportunities for brain preservation, so the
effectiveness of AMPK on glial cells should be further investigated.
In the present study, we therefore investigated whether AMPK
inhibition protected against cerebral I/RI in mice, and whether this
neuroprotective effect involved glial cells.

compared with mice that had undergone sham surgery (cortex:
0.7070.20, Fig. 1A; hippocampus: 0.6970.23, Fig. 1B). The levels of
pAMPK were reduced in Compound C-treated mice (cortex:
0.9370.23, Po0.01, Fig. 1A; hippocampus: 0.9670.38, Po0.05,
Fig. 1B), while total AMPK levels were unchanged.

2.2.
AMPK inhibition conferred neuroprotection in cerebral
ischemic mice
After reperfusion for 24 h, neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct
volumes were measured. Neurological deﬁcit scores were
2.6370.52 in the MCAO vehicle-treated mice and 1.8870.64 in
the MCAO plus Compound C-treated mice. Compared with the
MCAO only group, AMPK inhibition signiﬁcantly improved the
neurological deﬁcit (Po0.01, Fig. 2A). Sham-operated mice did
not show any neurological deﬁcit, and after TTC (2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining, no infarcted areas were
observed in these animals. The infarcted volume in the MCAO
plus Compound C group was (26.09713.95)%, which was lower
than the MCAO group [(45.99712.98)%]. AMPK inhibition therefore signiﬁcantly reduced the cerebral infarction volume in the I/
R mice (Po0.01, Fig. 2B and C).

2.3.

In this study, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used as a
marker of astrocyte activation. In the sham group, most
astrocytes were in the resting form, with small and round cell
bodies and thin processes (Fig. 3A). In the MCAO-treated
group, most GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes appeared in
the activated form, with swollen and deeply stained cell bodies
with thick processes (Fig. 3A). In the MCAO plus Compound C
group, some GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes appeared in the
activated form, while many others appeared in the resting
form (Fig. 3A). The number of GFAP positive cells was counted,
and the results showed a statistically signiﬁcant (2.6-fold;
Po0.01) increase in the number of GFAP positive cells in the
MCAO group (Fig. 3B). Importantly, Compound C treatment
signiﬁcantly decreased the number of GFAP positive cells
(Po0.05) as compared to cells in the MCAO group (Fig. 3B).

2.4.
AMPK inhibition induced the expression of Cx43 in
astrocytes
In the sham group, there was a small amount of Cx43 mRNA
expression (0.3870.06). Compared with the sham group, the
expression of Cx43 mRNA signiﬁcantly decreased by 45% in
the MCAO group (Po0.05, Fig. 4). Furthermore, AMPK inhibition signiﬁcantly increased Cx43 mRNA expression 2.1-fold
(Po0.05) compared to the MCAO group (Po0.05, Fig. 4).

demonstrated that AMPK inhibition had the ability to regulate
microglia-mediated inﬂammation.

2.6.
AMPK inhibition attenuated production of proinﬂammatory factors
Activated microglias produce an array of pro-inﬂammatory factors that cause brain damage. We investigated the effects of
AMPK inhibition on Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) and IL-1β
levels, and iNOS formation. Compared with the sham group, the
MCAO group contained higher TNFα levels (442.92797.59 pg/mg
vs. 249.62748.37 pg/mg in the sham group; Po0.01; Fig. 6A), and
higher IL-1β levels (209.09724.69 pg/mg vs. 107.41711.77 pg/mg in
the sham group; Po0.01; Fig. 6B). Compared with the MCAO
group, Compound C treatment decreased TNFα levels (290.607
61.40 pg/mg vs. 442.92797.59 pg/mg in the MCAO group; Po0.01;

Fig. 6A), with signiﬁcantly decreased IL-1β levels (142.61720.60 pg/
mg vs. 209.09724.69 pg/mg in the MCAO group; Po0.01; Fig. 6B).
However, cerebral iNOS/β-actin ratios were signiﬁcantly higher
(Po0.05) in the MCAO group (1.3370.36) than in the sham group
(0.8570.32). Administration of Compound C to the MCAO group
led to a signiﬁcant decrease (Po0.05) in iNOS/β-actin ratios
(0.9670.31), compared with the MCAO group, demonstrating that
AMPK inhibition efﬁciently prevented the formation of iNOS
(Fig. 6C and D).

AMPK inhibition downregulated NFκB protein

Compared with the sham group (cortex, 0.7270.24; hippocampus, 0.7370.30), the MCAO group showed increased expression
of nuclear NFκB/p65 in the brain cortex (1.4270.37; Po0.01;
Fig. 7A) and hippocampus (1.2870.25; Po0.01; Fig. 7B). In

Discussion

The present study demonstrated that inhibition of AMPK
activity protected mice from cerebral I/RI. Importantly, our
data highlighted the critical roles of astroglia and microglia in
mediating the neuroprotective properties of AMPK.
We conﬁrmed that levels of AMPK phosphorylation were
elevated and AMPK was activated in the ischemic brain of
mice after cerebral I/RI. When the brain is under ischemic
conditions, ATP levels cannot adequately supply the demand,
and the ATP/AMP ratio falls, leading to AMPK activation
(Hardie et al., 2012). AMPK is a strong stimulator of glycolysis,
which produces lactate in the ischemic brain. A previous
study reported that ischemic activation of AMPK exacerbated
stroke injury by enhancing stroke-induced lactic acidosis (Yu
and Yang, 2010). We tested the effects of AMPK inhibition in
the brain ischemia reperfusion injury model of mice. When
Compound C was used to inhibit AMPK activity, the brain
infarct volume was signiﬁcantly decreased and neurologic
outcomes were signiﬁcantly improved. These results strongly
supported our hypothesis that inhibition of AMPK is beneﬁcial to the ischemic brain.
Our study proved that astrocytes were activated in the
hippocampus of ischemic brain. After Compound C was used
to inhibit AMPK activity, the number of activated astrocytes

5

signiﬁcantly decreased. A number of studies have shown that
activated astrocytes secrete pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-6,
TNFα, IL-1α and β, interferon γ, and other cytokines, resulting
in brain injury (Niu et al., 2009; Tuttolomondo et al., 2008).
Inhibition of AMPK activity can therefore suppress excessive
activation of astrocytes, reduce pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
production, and mitigate brain injury.
Studies have reported that astrocytes play a multifaceted
role in the response to ischemia (Barreto et al., 2011), and
astrocytes are a major source of antioxidants and growth
factors in the brain (Lev et al., 2013; Ossola et al., 2011; Wu
et al., 2009). Some neurotransmitters, ion channel, and
nutrition factor receptors are present on the astrocyte surface, where they regulate extracellular glutamate concentration (Verkhratsky, 2010; Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff, 2007),
promoting the normal metabolism of neurotransmitters and
participating in substance exchange and information communication among neurons (Rossi et al., 2007). Furthermore,
astrocytes provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons
and modulate synaptic transmission (Yanagida et al., 2009).
We detected Cx43 mRNA expression in activated astrocytes.
The results showed that AMPK inhibition signiﬁcantly promoted Cx43 mRNA expression, i.e., enhancing astrocyte
resistance to ischemic stress by overexpressing protective
proteins. Gap junctions are special structures between adjacent cell membranes, and are widely abundant in the nervous
system. These structures connecting astrocyte networks are
needed for maintaining the internal environment steady
state and for normal signal transduction (Nakase et al.,
2003). When information transfer is within the nervous
system, gap junctions bind to each other, allowing free
passage of small molecules and regulating nerve cell differentiation, development, and physiological functions (Zou and
Zhao, 2009). During cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, normal cells provide energy support and signal transmission to
adjacent cells through gap junctions, to reduce cell damage.
Connexins are a large class of membrane proteins that
constitute gap junctions. Among the many types of connexins, Cx43 is the main component of gap junctions in the
brain, is mainly expressed in astrocytes, and is required for
astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection. In the ischemic brain,
Cx43 expression in activated astrocytes sharply declines,
followed by rapid dephosphorylation and superﬁcial protein
epitope internalization (Martinez and Sáez, 2000), resulting in
a decrease in the neuroprotective effects of gap junctions.
Inhibition of AMPK activity can suppress astrocyte activation,
and stabilize the expression and function of Cx43 in astrocytes, to open gap junctions. Therefore, it contributes to a
stable internal environment and normal signal transduction
after cerebral ischemia. Our data, in the present study,
suggested that a signiﬁcant part of the neuroprotective
effects of AMPK inhibition may be due to an increased
expression of Cx43 in astroglias.
There are extensive studies reporting the role of neuroinﬂammation in brain injury after an ischemic episode (Graeber
et al., 2011; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011; Shah et al., 2009).
Neuroinﬂammation is characterized by activated microglias and
astrocytes that appear in the central nervous system, to increase
expression levels of inﬂammatory mediators, chemokines, and
complement proteins (Ransohoff and Perry, 2009; Rubio-Perez

and Morillas-Ruiz, 2012). Our results showed that when mice
were subjected to cerebral ischemia reperfusion, microglias were
activated and iNOS protein expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in the ischemic cerebral cortex. We also measured
TNFα and IL-1β levels in the ischemic brain. The results suggested that production of TNFα and IL-1β signiﬁcantly increased
after cerebral ischemic injury, while AMPK inhibition effectively
neutralized this process. After cerebral ischemia reperfusion,
microglias showed proliferation, chemotaxis, and macrophagelike changes, and produced many inﬂammatory cytokines.
These inﬂammatory cytokines can then activate more microglias, which creates a positive feedback loop. Inhibiting microglia
activation and proliferation produced a protective effect during
brain ischemic injury (Khan et al., 2005). Increase of microgliamediated iNOS levels produced large amounts of free radicals
and induced nerve cell damage (Graeber and Streit, 2010; Hur
et al., 2010), and iNOS knockout or inhibition had protective
effects on neuronal ischemic damage (Khan et al., 2004). Activated microglias are an important source of free radicals and
inﬂammatory mediators in the brain (Yenari et al., 2010). However, activated astrocytes can also secrete TNFα and IL-1β (Zhang
et al., 1998). After we inhibited AMPK activity in the mice MCAO

model, overactivation of microglias and astrocytes was inhibited,
and neuroinﬂammation injury was consequently ameliorated in
the brain.
Activation of several transcription factors, such as nuclear
factor-κB (NFκB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
activator protein-1 (AP-1) have been documented in experimental stroke models. Among these transcription factors that work
in concert to induce transcription of pro-inﬂammatory genes,
NFκB is perhaps the most important (Gu et al., 2012). Therefore,
we characterized the effects of AMPK activity inhibition on the
NFκB signaling pathway, and detected NFκB/p65 protein expression in nuclei of ischemic brain cortex and hippocampus. The
results indicated that NFκB/p65 protein expression signiﬁcantly
increased after cerebral I/RI, whereas administration of Compound C attenuated expression of NFκB/p65.
NFκB is an important intracellular transcription factor, widely
present in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells in the brain.
There are ﬁve kinds of NFκB subunits: p50, p52, c-Rel, RelA (p65),
and RelB. Transport of p50 or p65 from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus activates the NFκB pathway. The most abundant form of
NFκB is a p50/p65 heterodimer subunit, in which the p65 subunit
contains the transcriptional activation domain. In the resting

brain research 1605 (2015) 1–11

state, IκB binds to this dimer and induces the anchorage of NFκB
in the cytosol. IκB kinase (IKKs) can phosphorylate IκBs, leading
to IκB degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. This
process of IκB phosphorylation and degradation stimulates NFκB
transfer from the cytosol to the nucleus, and promotes the
transcription of several genes through the binding of NFκB to

7

speciﬁc DNA enhancer sequences (Ha et al., 2012). NFκB activation regulates the expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNFα, and IL-1β, (Li
and Bi, 2010; Martín-de-Saavedra et al., 2011) and initiates
inﬂammation damage. Under long-term and fatal ischemic
conditions, NFκB activation exacerbated brain damage (Ridder
and Schwaninger, 2009). We used Compound C to inhibit AMPK
activity in the ischemic brain. Inhibition of AMPK activity can
block activation of the NFκB signaling pathway, resulting in the
downregulation of pro-inﬂammatory mediators, thus acting as a
neuroprotector. Our ﬁndings highlighted the direct anti-inﬂammatory properties of AMPK inhibition.
In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated
that the inhibition of AMPK activity resulted in neuroprotection
against cerebral I/RI. The underlying mechanisms of AMPKelicited neuroprotection may be mediated, at least in part, via
preventing the recruitment of activated microglias, inhibiting
microglia-mediated inﬂammation, and increasing the expression of Cx43 in astroglias. We therefore suggest that inhibiting
AMPK may be a promising strategy to reduce cerebral ischemia
reperfusion injury.

The MCAO model was developed as previously described
(Luo et al., 2007). Brieﬂy, the mice were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of composite anesthetic ketamine
(ketamine:diazepam:atropine at 2 ml:1 ml:1 ml, diluted with
saline to 15 ml, at a dose of 1.5–2.0 ml/kg). Body temperature
was maintained at 3770.5 1C with a heating lamp. A piece of
silicone suture of 0.22 mm diameter (Sunbio Bio-Technology
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was inserted to the origin of the right
middle cerebral artery. Mice were subjected to 1 h of occlusion, and then the suture was withdrawn for blood reperfusion. Sham-treated mice underwent the same procedure, but
without MCAO.

MD USA). The following formula was used: V¼ (S1þS2)  d/2,
where V was the total volume, S1 was the slice cephalic area, S2
was the slice caudal area, and d was the slice thickness. Infarct
volume in all slices was expressed as a percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere after correcting for edema.

TNFα and IL-1β determination

After reperfusion for 24 h, mice were sacriﬁced and the brains
were removed (n¼ 8 per group). Ischemic brain tissue was
added to cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized by
ultrasound. The brain tissue homogenate was centrifuged at
12,000g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and stored
at  20 1C until use. The production of TNFα and IL-1β was
measured by mice TNFα and IL-1β enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Boster Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Wuhan, China), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Fig. 7 – Effect of AMPK inhibition on NFκB/p65 expression in
nuclei. AMPK inhibition signiﬁcantly reduced NFκB/p65
protein expression in the cortex (A) and hippocampus (B).
Values were calculated as relative intensity, normalized to
β-actin intensity, and expressed as means7SEM (n ¼ 6 per
group). nPo0.01 vs. the sham group; #Po0.01 vs. the MCAO
group; ##Po0.05 vs. the MCAO group.

Drug treatments

Mice were randomly assigned to sham-treated, MCAO-treated,
or MCAO plus Compound C-treated groups (n¼ 38 per group).
Mice were treated with AMPK speciﬁc inhibitor Compound C
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), using 20 mg/kg (Li et al.,
2010), by intraperitoneal injection, immediately when the
suture was inserted. The same amount of saline was used as
the vehicle. Mice were sacriﬁced after 24 h of reperfusion.

4.3.

Neurological deﬁcit score

After 24 h of reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit scores were evaluated as previously described (Longa et al., 1989), using a ﬁvepoint scale (grade 0, no observable deﬁcit; grade 1, a failure to

4.6.

Immunohistochemistry

After 24 h of reperfusion, the mice (n¼ 8 per group) were
anesthetized with composite anesthetic ketamine and perfused
transcardially with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.
Brains were removed and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then cut into 5 mm thick coronal sections. Glial ﬁbrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) is a major component of astrocyte intermediate ﬁlament proteins (Maurel et al., 2000), and is a hallmark of astrocyte activation. Ionized calcium-binding adaptor
molecule 1 (Iba1) is speciﬁcally expressed in microglia in the
brain, and enhanced expression of Iba1 is an indication of
microglia activation (Ito et al., 2001). For immunohistochemistry, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4 1C with
primary antibodies against GFAP (1:150, Boster Biotechnology
Co.), and Iba1 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Sections were
then incubated for 90 min with biotinylated secondary antibody, treated with an avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex for 1 h
at room temperature, followed by color development with
0.02% 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The sections incubated with
phosphate buffer instead of the primary antibodies were used
as negative controls. The sections were examined by a microscope to locate relatively dense regions of cells of interest.

Photographs were obtained using an optical microscope (Leica
DM3000, Beijing, China) and a medical image analysis system.
Five discontinuous sections were randomly selected for each
brain. Quantiﬁcation of astrocytes was performed by counting
GFAP positive cells in the peri-infarct hippocampal region. Five
non-repeated high power ﬁelds were counted in each case at
 400 magniﬁcation, and the results from different ﬁelds, taken
from the same animal, were averaged and counted as one
sample. Quantiﬁcation of microglias was performed by counting Iba1 positive cells in the peri-infarct cortex, using the same
procedure used for counting GFAP positive cells.

4.7.

Real time PCR

Primers were designed and synthesized by Sangon Biological Co.,
Ltd (Shanghai, China). The sequences were as follows: Cx43
(forward, 50 -TACCACGCCACCACTGGC-30 ; reverse, 50 -AATCTCCAGGTCATCAGG-30 ); GAPDH (forward, 50 -TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-30 ; reverse, 50 -TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-30 ).
Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Gibco) (n¼ 8 per group). RNA was reversed transcribed into
cDNA by using the TaKaRa reverse transcription kit (Bao BioEngineering Co., Ltd. Dalian, China). Quantitative PCR was
performed with the ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Conditions
involved one cycle of 95 1C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of
95 1C for 30 s, 59.14 1C for 30 s, 72 1C for 1 min, and 72 1C for
5 min. GAPDH mRNA level was used as an internal quantitative control, and the level of the Cx43 transcript was normalized on the basis of GAPDH mRNA content.

4.8.

Western blot

Proteins were extracted from the ischemic brain cortex and
hippocampus according to procedures described previously
(Jia et al., 2009) (n¼ 6 per group). Protein concentration was
determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). Protein samples were
separated by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and then transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were
incubated overnight at 4 1C with primary antibodies against
AMPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Boston, USA),
pAMPK (1:1000, CST), iNOS (1:400, Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
NFκB/p65 (1:2000, Abcam), and β-actin (1:5000, Boster Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000, Boster Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were
visualized by using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology) and exposed to ﬁlm. The intensity
of blots was quantiﬁed with densitometry, and β-actin was
used as a loading control. The relative expression of pAMPK
was represented with pAMPK/AMPK gray value ratios.

4.9.

Statistical analysis

The software, SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
USA), was used to perform statistical analyses. Data were
expressed as means7SEM and analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance. The between group differences were detected

9

using the Least Signiﬁcant Difference (LSD) test. The criterion
for statistical signiﬁcance was Po0.05.
