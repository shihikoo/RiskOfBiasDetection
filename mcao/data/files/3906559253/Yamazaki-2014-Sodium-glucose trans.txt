Abstract—Cerebral ischemia can be exacerbated by postischemic hyperglycemia, which may involve the cerebral
sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT). However, the contribution of each SGLT isoform in cerebral ischemia is still
unclear. SGLT-1, -3, -4, and -6 have been reported to be
expressed in various brain regions. Among these isoforms,
only SGLT-3 does not transport glucose, but depolarizes the
plasma membrane when glucose is bound, suggesting that
SGLT-3 is a glucose sensor. Therefore, in this study, we
investigated the involvement of cerebral SGLT-3 in the
development of ischemia. The mouse model of focal ischemia was generated by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Neuronal damage was assessed by histological
and behavioral analyses. Fasting blood glucose levels on
day 1 after MCAO were not aﬀected in SGLT-3 siRNA-mediated knockdown of SGLT-3. The development of infarct volume and behavioral abnormalities on day 1 after MCAO were
exacerbated in SGLT-3 knockdown mice (control group:
n = 7, 94.2 ± 21.8 mm3, 2 (1.6–2.4), SGLT-3 knockdown
group: n = 6, 1414.8 ± 492.4 mm3, 6 (5.8–6.3), P < 0.05).
Moreover, SGLT-3 expression levels were signiﬁcantly
decreased in the striatum (65.0 ± 8.1%, P < 0.05) on day 1,
and in the hippocampus (67.6 ± 7.2%, P < 0.05) and hypothalamus (47.5 ± 5.1%, P < 0.01) on day 3 after MCAO
(n = 12–13). These eﬀects were signiﬁcantly inhibited by
donepezil (DPZ) treatment (SGLT-3 knockdown group:
n = 6, 1419.0 ± 181.5 mm3, 3.6 (3.4–3.7), SGLT-3 knockdown

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral stroke is the leading cause of death and
disability worldwide (Rezazadeh et al., 2013). Risk factors
for cerebral stroke include cardiac diseases, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, an
unhealthy diet, abdominal obesity, lack of exercise, psychosocial stress, and depression (Saito, 2012; He et al.,
2013). Strokes are particularly exacerbated by diabetes
or hyperglycemia (Fuentes et al., 2009; Harada et al.,
2012). A clinical study has reported that disorders of glucose metabolism exist in a population of acute cerebral
stroke patients. However, some patients with stroke do
not have a prior history of diabetes (Matz et al., 2006).
Moreover, insulin treatment in the acute phase of cerebral
stroke suppresses the disability of stroke (Gentile et al.,
2006; Rizk et al., 2006). Previous reports have also
shown that post-ischemic hyperglycemia can develop in
acute cerebral stroke resulting from impaired insulin sensitivity and enhanced gluconeogenesis. Moreover, we
have reported that in a mouse model of focal cerebral
ischemia, post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates neuronal damage (Harada et al., 2009, 2011). However, the
exact mechanism underlying this eﬀect is unclear. Therefore, we focused on the sodium-glucose transporter
(SGLT).
The SGLT family is a member of the solute carrier 5A
families, consisting of six isoforms (SGLT-1–6)
(Scheepers et al., 2004). The presence of SGLT-1, -3,
-4, and -6 has been reported in various brain regions
(Wright and Turk, 2004; O’Malley et al., 2006; Vemula
et al., 2009). SGLT transports glucose together with
Na+ ions into cells, generating inward currents in the process (Wright and Turk, 2004; Scheepers et al., 2004).
Cerebral stroke has been shown to be accompanied by
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, release of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and the initiation of apoptosis

(Rezazadeh et al., 2013). High-glucose conditions
decrease cell viability and increase apoptosis
(Benchoua et al., 2001). Therefore, post-ischemic hyperglycemia may activate the cerebral SGLT family and
exacerbate ischemic neuronal damage through glucose
and SGLT-induced depolarization. We have previously
demonstrated that the cerebral SGLT family is involved
in exacerbating cerebral ischemic neuronal damage
(Yamazaki et al., 2012). However, the SGLT isoform that
is involved in this damage remains unclear. Although
SGLT transports glucose with Na+ into the cell, the glucose sensor, SGLT-3 does not transport glucose, but
plays a role in depolarizing the plasma membrane via
the inﬂux of sodium when glucose is bound (Wright and
Turk, 2004; O’Malley et al., 2006). Moreover, SGLT-3 is
expressed in the small intestine and skeletal muscle, regulating both the peristaltic action of the small intestine and
muscle contraction, respectively (Diez-Sampedro et al.,
2003). However, the physiological function of brain
SGLT-3 has not been reported.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the
involvement of cerebral SGLT-3 in the development of
cerebral ischemic neuronal damage.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Experiments were performed on male ddY mice (5 weeks
old, 25–30 g), which were obtained from SLC (Shizuoka,
Japan). The animals were housed between 23 and
24 °C with a 12-h light–dark cycle. Food and water were
available ad libitum. The present study was conducted
in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, adopted by the
Japanese Pharmacological Society. Additionally, all
experiments were approved by the ethics committee for
animals of the Kobe Gakuin University (approval
number: A13–25).
Western immunoblot analysis
Western immunoblotting was performed as previously
described (Yamazaki et al., 2012) but with some modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, each brain region was homogenized in
homogenization buﬀer, and protein samples were loaded
(20 or 40 lg/lane) and separated in 7.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). SGLT-3 or -1 was detected using (1:200)
(Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) or
(1:1,000) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), respectively.
Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(loading control) was detected with (1:20,000) (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA). Membranes were incubated with
the primary antibodies in phosphate-buﬀered saline
(PBS) containing 1% (v/v) Tween-20 and 5% (w/v) blocking agent (GE Healthcare, Toyko, Japan) at 4 °C, overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated
(1 h, at room temperature) with the secondary antibodies:
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(1:1000) (KPL, Guildford, UK) for SGLT-1 and 3, or

135

HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) (KPL) for
GAPDH. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the
Light-Capture instrument (AE-6981) (ATTO, Tokyo,
Japan) with the enhanced chemiluminescence western
blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare, Toyko, Japan).
The signal intensity of immunoreactive bands was analyzed using Cs-Analyzer software (Version 3.0) (ATTO).

Administration of SGLT-3 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in the brain
SGLT-3
was
intracerebroventricularly
(i.c.v.)
administered to mice ON-TARGETplus SMART pool
(SGLT-3 siRNA) (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Kanagawa, Japan),
ON-TARGETplus Nontargeting Pool (control siRNA)
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), and jetPEI + 5% glucose (cationic
polymer transfection reagent; Polyplus Transfection,
New York, NY, USA) was administered to knockdown
SGLT-3 protein levels. I.c.v. was performed, as
described previously (Haley and McCormick, 1957;
Harada et al., 2011). In brief, a microsyringe with a 27gauge stainless-steel needle was used for all experiments. Tubing covered all but the terminal 2.5–3.0 mm
of the needle to make a track through the brain and into
the lateral ventricle but not through the ﬂoor of the lateral
ventricle. The needle was inserted unilaterally into the lateral ventricle of the brain (1.0 mm lateral and 1.0 mm posterior to bregma), as described previously (Harada et al.,
2011). Veriﬁcation of the needle position in the lateral
cerebroventricular region was made by an i.c.v. injection
of the dye and subsequent postmortem brain section veriﬁcation of dye placement. SGLT-3 siRNA was administrated on day 3 before the operation.

Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia
The mouse model of transient focal ischemia was
generated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
as described previously (Harada et al., 2009). Brieﬂy,
mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and kept under a
heating lamp to maintain the core body temperature at
37.0 ± 0.5 °C. The left middle cerebral artery was
occluded for 2 h by the insertion of 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament with a thin silicon coat through the common carotid
artery followed by reperfusion. Sham-operated mice
underwent the same surgical procedure but without
suture insertion. A laser Doppler probe inserted into the
acrylic sheath was positioned over the left skull 2 mm posterior to bregma and 6 mm to the left side of the midline.
Baseline relative cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) values measured before the occlusion were deﬁned as 100%. MCAO
was recorded as a decrease in rCBF to 40% of control
values, and rCBF was recovered to about 100% by reperfusion (Harada et al., 2009). Physiological parameters
were measured before, during and 30 m after MCAO by
using the sphygmomanometer (TK-370C) (Brain Science
idea, Osaka, Japan) and i-STAT (300F; FUSO Pharmaceutical Industries, Osaka, Japan), as described previously (Harada et al., 2009). We eliminated mice by
pricking the brain on the silicon-coated 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament and unsuccessful infarction on day 1 after MCAO.

The ﬁnal number of mice is described in each ﬁgure
legend.
Measurement of fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels
Starting 9 h after the onset of MCAO, mice were fasted for
15 h for the measurement of FBG levels, and blood
samples (1.5 ll) were obtained from the tail veins.
Plasma FBG was measured using the Glucose Pilot
(Aventir Biotech, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The increment in
FBG was calculated, as previously described (Harada
et al., 2009), using the following formula: FBG increment = FBG after MCAO–FBG before MCAO (preMCAO FBG). Pre-MCAO FBG was measured 48–96 h
before MCAO.

Neurological examination
Neurological examination was performed on day 1 after
MCAO using the neurological deﬁcit score (NDS),
consisting of consciousness (0, normal; 1, restless; 2,
lethargic; 3, stuporous; 4, seizures; 5, death), walking
(0, normal; 1, paw; 2, unbalanced walking; 3, circling; 4,
unable to stand; 5, no movement), limb tone (0, normal;
1, spastic; 2, ﬂaccid), and pain reﬂex, which was scored
after reperfusion, as described previously (Harada et al.,
2009). Pain reﬂex was assessed using the tail-ﬂick test
(pain reﬂex = latency after MCAO
latency before
MCAO). The diﬀerence in latency indicated NDS points.
A cutoﬀ time of 10 s was used to prevent any injury to
the tail.
Drug treatments

Measurement of infarct volume
Mice were killed and the brains were immediately
dissected to assess infarct outcome on day 1 after
MCAO. Coronal sections were cut (2-mm thick),
incubated
in
saline
containing
2%
2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma–Aldrich,
Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 10 m, and ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich). Infarct areas were
measured using image analysis software (ImageJ)
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and
Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 (Adobe Systems
Incorporated, Tokyo, Japan), as previously described
(Harada et al., 2009; Shichi et al., 2011). The infarct volume was calculated based on infarct area and intensity
(intensity = intensity of left hemisphere
intensity of
right hemisphere).

Mice were intraperitoneally administered 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg
donepezil (DPZ) (Sigma–Aldrich) immediately after
MCAO. DPZ was dissolved in saline.
Brain tissue preparation
Mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and
perfused transcardially with saline, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brain sections were collected, postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h, cryoprotected in
10% sucrose at 4 °C for 3 h and then in 20% sucrose at
4 °C overnight. Tissues were then frozen in optimal
cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek OCT
Compound) (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 °C,
until future use. Sections were cut (15-lm thick) with a
cryostat (CM1850) (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,

Double immunoﬂuorescence
Brain sections were washed with PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20 (PBST) (3  5 m) and incubated with blocking
buﬀer (3% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in PBS) for 1 h
at room temperature. The sections were then incubated
(24 or 48 h, at 4 °C) with the primary antibodies (in
reaction buﬀer [1% BSA in PBS]): rabbit polyclonal antiSGLT-3 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA),
monoclonal anti-mouse NeuN (1:1000) (Millipore,

(ChAT) (1:200) (Abcam, Tokyo, Japan). Sections were
then washed with PBST (3  5 m) and incubated (2 h,
room temperature) with the secondary antibodies
(diluted in reaction buﬀer): donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit
IgG, goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG, donkey polyclonal
anti-goat IgG, or donkey polyclonal anti-sheep IgG (all

then washed with PBST (3  5 m) and coverslips placed
with

with a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope (FV1000)
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

compared with control siRNA treatment, SGLT-3
siRNA signiﬁcantly exacerbated the development of
infarction and neurological abnormalities at this timepoint (control group; 94.2 ± 21.8 mm3, 2 (1.6–2.4),
SGLT-3 knockdown group; 1414.8 ± 492.4 mm3, 6

Changes in the expression levels of cerebral SGLT-3

Cerebral ischemic stress did not aﬀect the expression of
cortical SGLT-3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, compared with
the sham group, striatal SGLT-3 was signiﬁcantly
decreased in a time-dependent manner, reaching a
minimum on day 1 after and recovering on day 3 after

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. FBG levels,
infarct volume, and SGLT-3 expression levels in SGLT3 knock down mice were analyzed using a one-way
analysis of variance followed by the Scheﬀe’s post hoc
test. The changes in the expression levels of SGLT-3
after MCAO were analyzed using the F test followed by
the unpaired Student’s t-test. NDS was analyzed using
the Steel–Dwass test with the post hoc nonparametric
multiple comparison test, with the data presented as
medians (25th–75th percentile). Normality and equal
variance test was performed for all data before the post
hoc tests. Signiﬁcance was reached at values of
P < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

RESULTS
Eﬀect of SGLT-3 siRNA administration on the
expression levels of SGLT-1 and 3 in naive mice
SGLT-3 was widely distributed in the brain (Fig. 1A).
Furthermore, SGLT-3 was signiﬁcantly decreased in a
time-dependent manner, reaching a minimum at 3 days
after SGLT-3 siRNA injection (day 3; 58.2 ± 2.1%, day
4; 59.6 ± 6.6%, Fig. 1B). No eﬀect on the expression of
SGLT-1 was observed (Fig. 1C).

sham group, hippocampal and hypothalamic SGLT-3
were signiﬁcantly decreased on day 3 after MCAO
(hippocampus;

hypothalamus;
47.5 ± 5.1%, Fig. 3C, D).
Eﬀect of DPZ on cerebral ischemic stress-mediated
neuronal damage
DPZ (1, 3, or 5 mg/kg) did not aﬀect the elevation
of FBG 1 day after MCAO (Fig. 4A). Furthermore at this
time-point, only 3 mg/kg DPZ signiﬁcantly suppressed
the development of infarct volume compared with the
saline-treated group (saline-treated group; 1151.6 ±
215.6 mm3, 4.5 (3.9–5.1), 3 mg/kg DPZ-treated group;
284.1 ± 114.7 mm3, 3.3 (2.8–3.4), Fig. 4B, C). In
addition, all three doses of DPZ decreased NDS similar to
the reduction observed with the infarct volume (Fig. 4D).
Eﬀect of DPZ on the exacerbation of cerebral
ischemic stress-mediated neuronal damage in SGLT3 knockdown mice
In SGLT-3 siRNA-treated mice, 3 mg/kg DPZ did not aﬀect
the elevation of FBG on day 1 after MCAO (Fig. 5A) but
suppressed infarct volume compared with SGLT-3 siRNA
without DPZ and the saline-treated group (control siRNA
and saline-treated MCAO group; 545.5 ± 217.2 mm3, 1.5
(1.3–2.0), SGLT-3 siRNA and saline-treated MCAO group;
1419.0 ± 181.5 mm3, 3.6 (3.4–3.7), SGLT-3 siRNA and
3 mg/kg DPZ-treated MCAO group; 611.3 ± 205.3 mm3,
1.5 (1.4–1.8), Fig. 5B, C). Furthermore, SGLT-3 siRNAinduced increase of NDS was signiﬁcantly decreased by
3 mg/kg DPZ on day 1 after MCAO (Fig. 5D).

DISCUSSION
We have previously demonstrated that cerebral ischemia
is exacerbated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia, which is
suppressed by the SGLT inhibitor, pholizin (Yamazaki
et al., 2012). However, the SGLT isoform that aﬀects
the development of cerebral ischemia-mediated neuronal
damage in post-ischemic hyperglycemia is unknown. It
has reported that SGLT-1, 3, 4, 6 were distributed in the
brain. We have previously reported that SGLT-1 may be
involved in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we identiﬁed
the function of cerebral SGLT-3 in this study.
As previously explained, the regional distribution of
SGLT-3 in the brain remains unknown. In the present
study, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that SGLT-3 is

expressed throughout the brain, thus SGLT-3 may play a
role in the central nervous system. Our results from SGLT3 knockdown mice unexpectedly indicated that cerebral
SGLT-3 may be involved in the suppression of ischemic
neuronal damage. Furthermore, other isoforms, such as
SGLT-1, -4, and -6 may be inﬂuenced by the induction
and/or function of SGLT-3 knockdown. Previous reports
have revealed that the expression of cerebral SGLT-1 is
signiﬁcantly increased in the cortex and the striatum on day
1 after MCAO (Yamazaki et al., 2012). In consequence, that

SGLT-3 did not interact with SGLT-1 because there is no
aﬀect on SGLT-1 expression in SGLT-3 knock down mice
in the present study. SGLT-3 depolarizes the membrane
potential via an uncoupled inward Na+ current, mediated
by a transporter and/or a channel (Voss et al., 2007;
Bianchi and Dı́ez-Sampedro, 2010). Moreover, SGLT-3 is
expressed in and regulates the activity of cholinergic neurons
of the peripheral tissue, such as the small intestine and skeletal muscle (Diez-Sampedro et al., 2003). Acetylcholine
(Ach) induces mild dilation in the middle cerebral artery
(Winters et al., 2012). Furthermore, activation of cholinergic
neurons delays neuronal cell death following transient cerebral ischemia mediated by increased CBF in the cortex
(Hotta et al., 2002). Ach also improves moderate focal cerebral ischemic injury through increased Ach/endothelial nitric
oxide synthase-mediated perfusion (Kim et al., 2013).
Therefore, post-ischemic hyperglycemia may induce the activation of SGLT-3 in cholinergic neurons, resulting in a neuroprotective eﬀect.
Interestingly, the expression levels of SGLT-3 in the
present study were decreased in core regions such as
the striatum at the beginning, and decreased in

penumbral regions, such as the hippocampus and
hypothalamus. Development of infarction has been
shown to peak on day 3 after MCAO and is maintained
up to day 5 after MCAO (Harada et al., 2009). This time
lag in which SGLT-3 is decreased may be caused by
the progression of strokes.
DPZ is reported to improve infarction, spatial learning
memory, and detrusor over-activity by cerebral ischemia
(Fujiki et al., 2005; Nakai et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007).
In the present study, DPZ suppressed the development
of ischemic neuronal damage, suggesting that DPZ-mediated increase of Ach suppressed the development of
ischemic neuronal damage. Moreover, we demonstrated
that at an eﬀective dose, DPZ suppressed exacerbated
neuronal damage in SGLT-3 knockdown mice. Therefore,
cholinergic system dysfunction may play a role in exacerbating cerebral ischemic neuronal damage in SGLT-3
knockdown mice.
SGLT-1 is expressed in the blood–brain barrier and
neurons, but not in the glial cells (Poppe et al., 1997;
Matsuoka et al., 1998). However, the expression of
SGLT-3 in the diﬀerent cell types of the central nervous

system remains unknown. In our present study, SGLT-3
was localized in neurons, including cholinergic forms,
but not in astrocytes. These results support our hypothesis that SGLT-3 may be activated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia, and improve cerebral stroke via its activation on
cholinergic neurons. However, in line with our previous
report, inhibition of all cerebral SGLT isoforms by phlorizin
is neuroprotective against exacerbated cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage. This discrepancy may be because of a
diﬀerence between the isoforms for their aﬃnity to the
SGLT inhibitor and their distribution in the brain. In addition, there may be a diﬀerence in the coupling ratio with
Na+ and the aﬃnity for glucose, although the mechanisms underlying these eﬀects remain unknown. The
reports about the function of cerebral SGLT-3, 4, 6 were
very few. It was reported that the infarct-edema ratio during MCAO was signiﬁcantly decreased by inhibiting of
SGLTs, but not treated in the focal brain (Vemula et al.,
2009). As per some reports of the peripheral region, it
was indicated that SGLTs may contribute to hyperglycemia-induced ROS production. (Balteau et al., 2011).

However, the detail role of individual SGLT isoforms in
the brain is not yet clear. Cerebral SGLT isoforms, such
as SGLT-1, -4, -6 may also be involved in the development of ischemic neuronal damage from our present
study, particularly cerebral SGLT-1 because its expression level is dramatically increased in focal cerebral ischemia (Yamazaki et al., 2012). Moreover, as per recent
reports, SGLT-1 immunoreactivity was observed in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, that induced neuronal damage (Yu et al., 2011). The balance of each SGLT isoform
expression level and/or relation of authority may be important for the development of cerebral neuronal damage.

CONCLUSION
The activation of SGLT-3 in post-ischemic hyperglycemia
may suppress the development of cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage. Moreover, the neuroprotective eﬀect
of SGLT-3 may occur by releasing Ach via its activation
of cholinergic neurons. Therefore, our results may have

signiﬁcant therapeutic potential for the treatment of
strokes.
