SUMMARY
1. In the present study, we investigated the effects of postischaemic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with
enalapril on vasogenic oedema formation and blood–brain
barrier (BBB) integrity following transient focal cerebral
ischaemia in rats.
2. Cerebral ischaemia was induced by 60 min occlusion of
the right middle cerebral artery, followed by 24 h reperfusion.
Vehicle and a non-hypotensive dose of enalapril (0.03 mg/kg)
were administered at the beginning of the reperfusion period.
A neurological deﬁcit score (NDS) was determined for all rats
at the end of the reperfusion period. Then, brain oedema formation was investigated using the wet–dry weight method and
BBB permeability was evaluated on the basis of extravasation
of Evans blue (EB) dye. In addition, oxidative stress was
assessed by measuring reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain homogenates.
3. Inhibition of ACE by enalapril signiﬁcantly reduced
NDS and decreased brain oedema formation (P < 0.05 for
both). Disruption of the BBB following ischaemia resulted in
considerable leakage of EB dye into the brain parenchyma of
the ipsilateral hemispheres of vehicle-treated rats. Enalapril
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) decreased EB extravasation into the
lesioned hemisphere. Enalapril also augmented anti-oxidant
activity in ischaemic brain tissue by increasing GSH concentrations and signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) attenuating the increased
MDA levels in response to ischaemia.
4. In conclusion, inhibition of ACE with a non-hypotensive
dose of enalapril may protect BBB function and attenuate
oedema formation via anti-oxidant actions.
Key words: blood–brain barrier, brain oedema, enalapril,
glutathione, malondialdehyde.

the brain.1 It is the major determinant of patient survival during
the ﬁrst few hours after stroke. Oedema exacerbates primary
ischaemic injury of the brain by adversely affecting perfusion of
the penumbra by compressing the cerebral vasculature as a result
of increased intracranial pressure and herniation.2 Therefore, preventing the development of brain oedema may decrease cerebral
injury and reduce the mortality of ischaemic stroke.
Ischaemic brain oedema is a combination of cytotoxic (cellular)
and vasogenic oedemas. Cytotoxic oedema, which is reversible,
develops within minutes to hours after ischaemia, whereas vasogenic oedema is irreversible and takes hours to days to develop.3
Vasogenic oedema is deﬁned as the net effusion of ﬂuid from the
blood vessels into the extracellular space.4 In the brain, vasogenic
oedema is characterized by an increase in extracellular volume
due to the increased permeability of brain capillaries to macromolecular plasma proteins, such as albumin.3 Vasogenic oedema is
dangerous because it increases the risk of haemorrhage from
damaged vessels;5 furthermore, when the oedema is signiﬁcant, it
can displace the brain hemispheres, leading to cerebral herniation.3 Brain oedema observed 24 h after ischaemia is due mainly
to vasogenic oedema caused by disruption or increased permeability of the BBB.6,7 It has been suggested that protecting BBB
integrity reduces neuronal injury following ischaemia.8
Various mechanisms are involved in the formation of ischaemic brain oedema. The molecular cascade initiating cerebral
oedema induces a loss of membrane ionic pumps, leading to cellular swelling9 and the formation of free radicals10 and proteases,11 which eventually results in the disruption of vascular
walls. Increasing evidence indicates that, after cerebral ischaemia
and especially reperfusion, oxidative stress caused by the production of free radicals is involved in brain damage.12 Free radicals
initiate lipid peroxidation of membrane-bound polyunsaturated
fatty acids, leading to impairment of membrane structural and
functional integrity.13 The formation of free oxygen radicals in
brain tissue during or immediately after ischaemia is known to
increase BBB permeability10 and contribute to the formation of
vasogenic brain oedema.
There is some evidence of a role for angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin (Ang) II in ischaemic
neuronal injury.14 It has been suggested that inhibition of the
renin–angiotensin system (RAS) may be effective not only in
reducing the incidence of stroke, but also in attenuating neuronal
injury following stroke.15 It was reported that preischaemic treatment with a non-hypotensive dose of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor,
improves neurological activity and reduces cerebral infarct volume in normotensive rats.16 Moreover, it has been reported that

enalapril pretreatment reduces the intensity of tissue swelling and
the formation of brain oedema.17
Postischaemic treatment with a non-hypotensive dose of enalapril has been reported to reduce brain infarct volume.18 Yet,
neurovascular protection against cerebral ischaemic oedema is
not observed with such treatment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of postischaemic treatment with enalapril on brain oedema formation, BBB disruption
and oxidative stress biomarkers following transient focal cerebral
ischaemia in rats.

METHODS
Male
normotensive
Sprague-Dawley
rats
(280–320 g,
8–10 weeks old) were obtained from the Central Animal House
Facility of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran).
All study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and
adhered to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the
care and use of animals. Rats were housed in a temperature (22–
24°C)-controlled environment at 40–60% humidity under a 12 h
light–dark period (lights on 0700–1900 hours).

221

Baseline CBF, measured before MCAO, was deﬁned as 100%.
Successful MCAO was documented as a decrease in laser Doppler
signals to < 20% of baseline. Rats in which MCAO was incomplete (i.e. rCBF was not < 20% of baseline; n = 2) or those that
died in the 24 h after the induction of ischaemia (n = 1) were
excluded from the study.
Induction of transient focal cerebral ischaemia
In the present study, 60 min MCAO and 24 h reperfusion of the
right cerebral hemisphere was performed using the intraluminal
ﬁlament method described by Longa et al.20 and modiﬁed by
Vakili et al.21 Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery was
exposed through a midline incision in the neck. A surgical nylon
thread (3–0, coated with poly L-lysine) was placed in the internal
carotid artery via the external carotid artery and gently advanced
until resistance was encountered and a sharp decline in the blood
ﬂow trace was observed. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
was terminated after 60 min by gently pulling out the thread.
After blood ﬂow to the ischaemic region was re-established, all
incisions were sutured and rats were allowed to recover from the
anaesthetic. All rats were returned to a warm cage to recuperate
over the following 24 h reperfusion period.

Experimental protocol
Rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 32 rats in
each group). Group 1 (sham) rats underwent surgery in the neck
region without being exposed to MCAO and were administered
vehicle (1 mL/kg, i.p., distilled water) at the end of surgery.
Group 2 (control ischaemic) rats were subjected to brain ischaemia by 60 min MCAO, followed by 24 h reperfusion; rats in this
group were also administered vehicle (1 mL/kg, i.p., distilled
water) at the beginning of reperfusion. Group 3 (enalapriltreated ischaemic) rats were subjected to the same ischaemia–
reperfusion protocol as Group 2 rats, but were given 0.03 mg/kg,
i.p., enalapril (Sigma Chemicals, Poole, UK) at the beginning of
reperfusion. In all cases, prior to surgery, rats were fasted overnight but had free access to water. Rats were anaesthetized with
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and body temperature was
maintained at 37.0  0.5°C using a heating feedback control
system.
Each of the three groups of rats was further subdivided into
four groups (n = 8 rats in each group). These four groups were
evaluated to determine: (i) NDS and brain oedema formation; (ii)
BBB permeability; (iii) levels of oxidative stress biomarkers,
namely GSH and MDA; and (iv) MAP during the experiment,
measured by cannulating the posterior tail artery and physiological parameters.
Laser Doppler ﬂowmetery
Regional CBF was monitored in the cerebral cortex of the right
hemisphere in the supply territory of the middle cerebral artery
using a laser Doppler ﬂowmeter pencil probe (MNP100u; ADInstruments, Sydney, NSW, Australia). Following dissection of the
right temporalis muscle between the eye and the ear, a burr hole
was drilled 5 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to Bregma19 to prevent displacement of the probe. Regional CBF was measured continuously before MCAO, during MCAO and during reperfusion.

Assessment of ischaemic oedema formation
Behavioural tests were performed by an observer blinded to the
surgical group 24 h after sham surgery or MCAO. Neurological
outcome was assessed on a ﬁve-point scale to yield an NDS, as
described previously.17 Brieﬂy, rats with normal motor function
were given a score of 1. Rats that exhibited ﬂexion of the contralateral torso or forelimb after being lifted up by their tail were
given a score of 2. Rats that circled to the side contralateral to
the occlusion were given a score of 3. Rats that exhibited a loss
of the righting reﬂex and decreased resistance to lateral push
were given a score of 4. Rats that exhibited no spontaneous
motor activity were given a score of 5.
Ischaemic brain oedema was assessed using the dry–wet
weight method of Gerriets et al.22 Brieﬂy, rats were deeply
anaesthetized with chloral hydrate, quickly decapitated and their
brain removed. Brains were placed in brain matrix to separate the
cerebellum and the olfactory bulb. Subsequently, through a midline sagittal incision, the brain was divided into the right and left
hemispheres in the sham group or into lesioned (right) and nonlesioned (left) hemispheres in the ischaemic groups. Each hemisphere was placed in a separate preweighed container to measure
its wet weight (ww). Then, the container and tissues were placed
in a 110°C oven for 24 h, after which the dry weight (dw) of the
tissue was measured. The absolute brain water content (WC) of
each hemisphere (%) and percentage oedema formation (% H2O)
of the lesioned hemisphere were determined using the following
equations:
WCð%Þ ¼ ½ðww  dwÞ=ww  100
Oedemað%Þ ¼ WCRH  WCLH
where WCRH and WCLH are the water content of the right and
left hemispheres, respectively.

Assessment of BBB permeability
Permeability of the BBB was evaluated quantitatively using
extravasation of EB dye.23–25 After surgery and preparation of
the rat, a polyethylene catheter was inserted into the lateral tail
vein for intravenous infusion of EB solution. Infusion of EB dye
(1 mL/kg of 2% EB solution in saline; 5 min) was started
30 min after surgery in the sham group and 30 min after termination of MCAO in the ischaemic groups. The neck and tail incisions were then sutured and rats were allowed to recover from
the anaesthesia and recuperate for 24 h. After determination of
the NDS, rats were anaesthetized with sodium thiopental (50 mg/
kg, i.p.), the chest was opened through a midline incision and the
whole body was perfused with approximately 250 mL warm saline solution (37°C) for 15 min via a catheter placed in the left
ventricle to wash out any EB dye remaining in the circulation.
After rats had been decapitated, the cerebellum and olfactory
bulb were removed and the brain was divided into the right and
left hemispheres. Each hemisphere was carefully weighed and
homogenized in 2.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
homogenized solution was mixed with 2.5 mL trichloroacetic
acid (60%) for 2 min and then centrifuged at 1640 g for 30 min.
The supernatant was collected and absorbance was measured at
610 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV 7500; Spectro Laboratory, Berkshire, UK). Concentrations of EB dye were determined
using a standard curve and results are expressed as lg/g brain
tissue.

Assessment of oxidative stress biomarkers
Preparation of tissue samples
Rats were decapitated 24 h after the start of reperfusion. Brains
were removed and the ischaemic area (core and penumbra) of the
ipsilateral hemisphere was dissected according to well-established
protocols in rodent models of unilateral MCAO.26,27 Brieﬂy, the
brain was sectioned into three slices beginning 3 mm from the
anterior tip of the frontal lobe. In Section 2 (4 mm) the ischaemic
area was dissected with a longitudinal cut approximately 2 mm
from the midline. The tissue was weighed and homogenized in
PBS with a weight : volume ratio of 1 : 5. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant from
each sample was collected into an Eppendorf tube and stored at
80°C until analysis.

protected from the light. A 50 lL aliquot of the reaction mixture
was injected onto an HPLC system equipped with a C18 column
(4.6 9 250 mm, 5 lm). Results are expressed as nmol MDA/mg
wet tissue weight.
Estimation of GSH
Concentrations of GSH, as a biomarker of anti-oxidant defence
capacity, were measured by HPLC, as described previously.29,30
Brieﬂy, 100 lL brain sample supernatant was placed in an
Eppendorf tube and diluted with an equal volume of trichloroacetic
acid (5% (w/v) ﬁnal concentration) and centrifuged at 10 000 g
for 15 min. Then, 100 lL supernatant was transferred to a new
Eppendorf tube. After alkalization, the sample was reacted with an
equal volume of 2,4-dinitroﬂuorobenzene solution (1.5% v/v in
ethanol) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After acidiﬁcation
with 10 lL HCl (37% v/v initial concentration), 50 lL sample
was loaded onto the HPLC. Results are expressed as mmol GSH/
mg wet tissue weight.
Statistical analyses
For the most part, data are presented as the mean  SEM. For
these data, the signiﬁcance of differences was evaluated using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test.
In contrast, NDS are given as median values with the interquartile range (25%–75%) in parentheses. The signiﬁcance of differences in NDS was determined using a Kruskal–Wallis one-way
ANOVA test. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20
(IBM, New York, NY, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance was
accepted at P < 0.05.

RESULTS
Mean arterial blood pressure
There were no signiﬁcant differences in mean arterial pressure
(MAP) among the sham, control ischaemic and enalapril
(0.03 mg/kg)-treated rats before ischaemia, during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and during reperfusion (Fig. 1).

Estimation of lipid peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring the MDA content
in brain samples using HPLC, as described previously.28,29
Brieﬂy, 100 lL supernatant was placed in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf
tube and 50 lL of 6 mol/L NaOH was added. Alkaline hydrolysis of protein-bound MDA was achieved by incubating this mixture in a 60°C water bath for 30 min. Then, the protein was
precipitated with 50 lL of 35% (v/v) perchloric acid and the
mixture was centrifuged at 2800 g for 10 min at 4°C. Then,
100 lL supernatant was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and
mixed with 10 lL of 2,4-nitrophenylhydrazine prepared as a
5 mmol/L solution in 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid. Finally, this
reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature

Cerebral blood ﬂow

Assessment of ischaemic brain oedema

Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was reduced to < 20% of
baseline in control ischaemic and enalapril-treated rats after
MCAO. There was no signiﬁcant difference in rCBF during
MCAO between the two groups. Post-ischaemic treatment with a
non-hypotensive dose of enalapril (0.03 mg/kg) had no signiﬁcant effect on rCBF (Fig. 2).

There was no signiﬁcant difference in the water content of the
left hemisphere of brains from different experimental groups.
Moreover, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the water content
of the left and right hemispheres of brains from sham-operated
rats. However, the water content of the right (ischaemic) hemisphere of brains from control ischaemic rats was signiﬁcantly
greater than that in sham-operated rats (83.16  0.34% vs
79.46  0.21%, respectively;
P < 0.001). Post-ischaemic
enalapril (0.03 mg/kg) treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the water
content of the right hemisphere (80.81  0.61%; P < 0.001)
compared with that in the control ischaemic group (Fig. 3a).
The brain oedema of vehicle-treated control ischaemic rats
(4.09  0.31%) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of sham-operated rats (P < 0.001). Enalapril treatment signiﬁcantly reduced
brain oedema formation (1.96  0.54%; P < 0.01 compared with
the control ischaemic group).

Physiological parameters
In the present study, we measured PaO2, PaCO2, pH, blood glucose and body temperature 10 min before MCAO, during MCAO
and 10 min after the start of reperfusion. There were no signiﬁcant differences in these parameters either within or between
groups (Table 1).
Neurological deﬁcit score
The vehicle-treated group exhibited considerable neurological
deﬁcit 24 h after MCAO. Enalapril treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced the nerological deﬁcit score (NDS) after MCAO compared with that in the vehicle-treated group (median (interquartile
range) 1.5 (1.0–2.0) vs 3 (2.0–3.0), respectively; P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA test).

Evaluation of BBB permeability
Figure 3b shows concentrations of Evans blue (EB) dye in the right
and left brain hemispheres in sham, control ischaemic and enalapriltreated ischaemic rats. There were no signiﬁcant differences in EB
concentrations in the left hemisphere among the different groups.
Moreover, there was no signiﬁcant difference in EB concentrations
in the right and left hemispheres of sham-operated rats. However,
the EB concentration in the right (ischaemic) hemisphere was signiﬁcantly greater in control ischaemic rats (12.48  1.93 lg/g;
P < 0.001) than in sham-operated rats. Post-ischaemic enalapril
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased EB concentrations on the
ischaemic side of the brain (6.4  0.92 lg/g; P < 0.001; Fig. 3b).
Assessment of malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione

Data are the mean  SEM (n = 8 in each group).

Ischaemia (60 min) followed by 24 h reperfusion signiﬁcantly
reduced concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and
increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in ischaemic brain
tissue compared with levels in the sham-operated group
(P < 0.001). Post-ischaemic enalapril treatment signiﬁcantly
increased GSH concentrations (P < 0.05) and reduced MDA content (P < 0.001) compared with levels in the control ischaemic
group (Fig. 4a,b).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that post-ischaemic enalapril (0.03 mg/kg) treatment reduced the NDS and brain oedema
formation in rats. In addition, we found that enalapril, at the
dose used, had no effect on blood pressure or rCBF. In accordance with our ﬁndings, Blezer et al.31 reported that enalapril
treatment prevented the development of cerebral oedema and
reduced the degree of manifested cerebral oedema. In addition,
Blezer et al.31 suggested that enalapril has protective effects
against brain oedema formation. Several mechanisms could be
involved in this protective effect. The ﬁrst possibility is that enalapril exerts its protective action as a result of its antihypertensive effects. However, as indicated by the results of the present
study and those of Blezer et al.,31 this is unlikely to be the predominant mechanism. Another possibility is that enalapril exerts
its protective effects by reducing the formation of AngII, an
active peptide of the RAS. The RAS is present in both the
peripheral circulation and the brain parenchyma.15 It has been
reported that brain concentrations of AngII speciﬁcally increase
after ischaemia–reperfusion injury, which is followed by an
increase in angiotensinogen mRNA.32 Because enalapril crosses
the BBB, it could effectively inhibit ACE in both brain tissue
and the circulation, especially under ischaemic conditions.33,34
Angiotensin II could have multiple detrimental effects. It has
been reported that AngII is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor;35
as such, high levels of AngII during ischaemia could contribute
to impairment of CBF.36

mean  SEM (n = 8 in each group). †P < 0.001 compared with the sham
group; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001, compared with the control group.

Moreover, AngII may be an important stimulus for the production of superoxide and peroxynitrite.37,38 Oxygen-derived
free radicals are known to increase the permeability of the
BBB.39 Thus, by inhibiting ACE, enalapril may reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting the
BBB. Indeed, we have shown herein, for the ﬁrst time, that enalapril treatment reduces the extravasation of EB dye 24 h after
ischaemia. This could explain the reduction in brain oedema
observed in enalapril-treated rats. There are no reports in the literature as to the role of the RAS in the disruption of the BBB
during ischaemia. However, it has been shown that the initial
BBB disruption seen in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
rats was effectively repaired following ACE inhibition.31,40
Awad41 has reported that inhibition of AT1 receptors by candesartan decreases BBB permeability in diabetic hypertensive rats.
These ﬁndings support the results of the present study, namely
that ACE inhibition may have protective effects on BBB
integrity.
The mechanisms involved in the protective effects of ACE
inhibition on BBB integrity are not completely understood. It has
been suggested that AngII contributes to ischaemic brain
injury42,43 and is involved in the formation of ischaemic brain
oedema.16,17 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the formation of free oxygen radicals in brain tissue during or immediately after ischaemia plays an important role in the destruction of

Enalapril attenuates ischaemic brain oedema
the endothelium and opening of the BBB.44 Our ﬁndings indicate
that enalapril, by inhibiting ACE, increased GSH, thereby
increasing brain anti-oxidant activity. In addition, enalapril attenuated the increase in MDA induced by ischaemia, indicating that
it decreases lipid peroxidation. It has been also reported that enalapril has protective effects against ROS-induced endothelium
dysfunction mediated via an anti-oxidant action.45,46 Furthermore,
Fu et al.32 have shown that oxidative stress following ischaemia–
reperfusion injury was reduced by candesartan, an AT1 receptor
blocker. These ﬁndings, together with those of the present study,
support the anti-oxidant effects of RAS inhibition. Therefore, the
protective effects of enalapril on BBB integrity, mediated via
ACE inhibition, may be due to reductions in ischaemia-induced
ROS production and lipid peroxidation.
In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that
postischaemic inhibition of ACE by enalapril reduces vasogenic
brain oedema formation by maintaining BBB integrity following
focal cerebral ischaemia. An increase in brain tissue anti-oxidant
capacity and a reduction in lipid peroxidation contribute, at least
in part, to the protective effects of enalapril.
