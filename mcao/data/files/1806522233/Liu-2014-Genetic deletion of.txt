Genetic deletion of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase kinase β (CaMKK β) or CaMK IV
exacerbates stroke outcomes in ovariectomized
(OVXed) female mice
Lin Liu1, Louise McCullough1,2 and Jun Li1*

Abstract
Background: Stroke is the primary cause of long-term disability in the United States. Interestingly, mounting evidence
has suggested potential sex differences in the response to stroke treatment in patients as, at least in part, distinct cell
death programs may be triggered in females and males following stroke. The NIH has recognized that females are strikingly
under-represented in pre-clinical trials. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) is a major kinase that
is activated by elevated intracellular calcium. It has recently been suggested that CaMKK and CaMK IV, a downstream target
molecule, are neuroprotective in stroke in males. In this study, we examined stroke outcomes in ovariectomized CaMKK
β and CaMK IV deficient females. Cell death/survival signaling and inflammatory responses were assessed.
Results: Our results demonstrated that CaMKK β or CaMK IV KO exacerbated both ischemic injury and
behavioral deficits in female mice. Genetic deletion of CaMKK β or CaMK IV increased hemorrhagic
transformation after stroke, and this was associated with both increased MMP9 activity and loss of the blood
brain barrier (BBB) protein collagen IV. Transcriptional inactivation was observed in mice lacking either CaMKK β
or CaMK IV, as indicated by reduced levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB)
and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) proteins. Finally, inhibiting this pathway exacerbated the inflammatory response
to stroke as CaMKK β or CaMK IV KO mice had increased levels of the pro-inflammatory serum cytokines tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after stroke. This suggests that the CaMKK pathway is involved
in the immune response to brain injury.
Conclusions: Inhibition of CaMKK signaling exacerbated stroke outcome and increased BBB impairment, transcriptional
inactivation and inflammatory responses in females after stroke. Therefore, CaMKK signaling may be a potential target
for stroke treatment in both males and females.

Background
Stroke is the primary cause of long-term disability in the
United States [1]. Despite decades of research, the only
currently available treatment for stroke is t-PA, which
has a very narrow therapeutic window owing to the risk
of hemorrhage [2]. The epidemiology of human stroke is
sexually dimorphic, and stroke rates are higher in men

than in women until advanced ages [3]. This sexual dimorphism is thought to result in part from differences
in gonadal hormone levels, particularly estrogen. However, the effect of biological sex on stroke outcome is
evident even in clinical populations with only minimal
differences in hormone levels, such as neonates and the
elderly, which suggests that non-hormonal factors also
contribute to outcome [4]. Indeed, experimental stroke
studies have demonstrated that distinct cell death programs
are triggered in females and males following stroke. For example, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) is thought to

be the dominant pathway for neuronal death in males,
whereas in females, caspase-dependent cell death is the
dominant pathway after stroke [5]. Based on this mounting
evidence supporting potential sex differences in responses to
stroke treatment, the criteria developed by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) urge scientists
to also study the responses of female animals to experimental stroke [6]. Additionally beginning in October 2014, NIH
will require grants applicants to report their plans for the
balance of male and female cells and animals in preclinical
studies in future applications [7].
Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
(CaMKK) is a major kinase that is activated by elevated
intracellular calcium and is highly abundant in the brain
[8]. Upon activation, CaMKK phosphorylates its downstream substrates CaMK I/IV. We have previously shown
that inhibiting the CaMKK/CaMK IV pathway exacerbates
infarcts and behavioral deficits after cerebral ischemia in
male mice, which suggests that this pathway is endogenously protective in stroke [9]. The underlying mechanisms
are not fully known, but they may involve increased blood
brain barrier (BBB) protection and regulation of transcriptional activation. Interestingly, studies have suggested that
the CaMKK pathway has functionally different effects in
hippocampal memory formation in male and female mice.
In males, CaMKK β (one of the two CaMKK isoforms) is
required for spatial memory formation, and deleting this
gene leads to impairment in long-term potentiation at
hippocampal CA1 synapses. However, this deficit was not
observed in female mice [10]. This male-specific function
of CaMKK in memory formation may be due to gene
transcription that only occurs in males [10]. Because transcriptional regulation is thought to be a key mechanism
by which CaMKK achieves its neuroprotective role in
stroke [9], the role of CaMKK signaling in response to
stroke may differ between the sexes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of deleting both CaMKK β and one of its
two downstream targets, CaMK IV in female mice after
stroke.

Methods
Animals

All experiments were approved by the Center for Laboratory
Animal Care of the University of Connecticut Health Center
and were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
animals. Both the CaMKK β knockout (KO) mice and the
CaMK IV KO mice were provided by Dr. Anthony Means
at Duke University and were backcrossed into the C57BL/
6 J background for at least 10 generations. Both KO strains
are normal in size and do not display any gross physical or
behavioral abnormalities. F1 heterozygous mattings were
used to generate control female mice, which were subsequently backcrossed into the C57BL/6 J background.

Female mice that were age- and weight-matched were
used in all experiments (20–24 g, 10–12 weeks of age). All
of the mice were OVXed 10 days before undergoing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described [11]. We used OVXed animals in this study to
control for the levels of gonadal hormones and to reduce
the experimental variability that is associated with varying
estrogen levels during estrus. This is also a more appropriate model for the “at risk” clinical population because the
vast majority of women who experience stroke are postmenopausal [4].
Middle cerebral artery occlusion

We induced focal transient cerebral ischemia (90 minutes
of MCAO) in CaMKK β or CaMK IV KO and WT female
(control) mice using previously established methods [12].
After 90 minutes of occlusion, the mice were reanesthetized and re-perfused by suture withdrawal.
During the ischemic period, their body temperature
was controlled at a physiological level using a heating
pad with a feedback thermo-control system (FST).
The animals were randomized into the stroke and surgical
sham cohorts. Mice in the sham group underwent the
same procedure except that the MCA was not occluded.
Behavior measurement

At 72 hours after the onset of stroke, neurological deficits were scored on a four-point scale as previously described, where 0: no deficit; 1: forelimb weakness and
torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held by the tail;
2: circling to the affected side; 3: unable to bear weight
on the affected side; and 4: no spontaneous locomotor
activity or barrel rolling [12].
Hemoglobin assay

At 72 hours after the onset of stroke, mice were anesthetized with Avertin and perfused transcardially with cold
PBS containing heparin (100 U/mL). The brains were removed, sliced, and initially used for 2,3,5-triphenyl-2
h-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as described below.
The brain slices were then dissected to separate the affected and unaffected hemispheres, and quantification
of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) was performed
using a spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay as previously described [12]. The affected hemispheres were
homogenized by sonication in distilled water, followed by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 minutes. After the
supernatant was collected, 200 μl of reaction reagent
(QuantiChrom Hemoglobin Assay Kit; BioAssay Systems,
Hayward, CA, USA) was added to each 50 μl of supernatant, and the samples were allowed to stand for 15 minutes
before the optical density was measured at 405 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Wallace 1420, PerkinElmer, Waltham,

MA, USA). Finally, the total hemoglobin concentration
was calculated as micrograms per hemisphere [12].

at 4°C. Cytokines were detected by ELISA, performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience,
US) [12].

Infarct measurement

At 72 hours after the onset of stroke, the animals were
sacrificed, and the brains were immediately removed and
cut into 5 individual 2-mm slices. These brain slices were
stained with 1.5% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) at
37°C for 8 minutes. Sigmascan Pro5 software was used to
analyze infarct volumes (corrected for edema) after the
brain TTC images were digitized, as previously described
[13]. Using the same software, edema formation (brain
swelling) was calculated. Edema = 100% * (ipsilateral
hemisphere volume - contralateral hemisphere volume)/
contralateral hemisphere volume.
Immunoblotting

To detect protein levels, mouse brains were harvested
6 hours after the onset of stroke and then homogenized
in RIPA lysis buffer (Boston Bioproducts). The concentration of protein in each sample was determined with a
BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). The proteins were separated using precast gels (7.5%, 10%, 12% or 4-15%,
Bio-Rad) and were then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After the transfer and
blocking steps, the blots were incubated overnight at
4°C with primary antibodies (anti-Collagen IV antibody,
1:500, Abcam; anti-p-CREB antibody, 1:1000, Abcam; or
anti-BCL-2 antibody, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology)
diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20
and 4% bovine serum albumin or 5% fat free milk. The appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, 1:5000,
Cell Signaling Technology; or anti-mouse IgG, 1:5000,
Vector) were diluted in the same blocking buffer, and
an electrochemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo
Scientific) was used for signal detection. β-actin (primary
antibody 1:5000; Sigma) was used as a loading control.
Gelatin zymography

We employed gelatin zymography to assess the activity
of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). At 6 hours after
stroke, the mice were sacrificed, and their brains were
removed and homogenized using RIPA lysis buffer (Cell
signaling). Aliquots of the supernatant, each containing
300 μg of protein, were subjected to affinity precipitation with gelatin-conjugated sepharose beads (GE, Life
Science). The bound material was released from the
beads in 50 μl of elution buffer with 10% DMSO. Finally,
the samples were analyzed with 10% gelatin zymogram gel
(Bio-Rad) [9].
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Blood samples were collected transcardially at 72 hours
after stroke and were spun at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes

Statistical analysis

All data are presented as the mean ± SEM except for
neurological scores, which are expressed as the median
(IQR). One-way ANOVA was used to perform mean
comparisons between the experimental groups, and a
post-hoc test (Tukey’s) was then used for multiple comparisons. Neurological scores were compared with the
Mann–Whitney U test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Behavioral and histological
assessments were conducted by an investigator who was
blinded to the genotype/drug treatment.

Results
CaMKK β and CaMK IV protein levels did not differ
between male and females

We used Western blots to measure protein levels of
CaMKK β and CaMK IV at baseline in both males and
females. Female ovarectomized mice and male mice displayed equal CaMKK β and CaMK IV protein levels in
the brain (n = 6 for each group) (Figure 1).
CaMKK β knockout exacerbated stroke injury

At 72 hours after stroke onset, CaMKK β KO OVXed female mice had significantly larger infarcts in the cortex,
the striatum and the total hemisphere compared to WT
controls (cortex: KO 66.1 ± 1.7% versus WT 55.9 ± 3.9%,
p < 0.05; striatum: KO 69.6 ± 3.1% versus WT 58.7 ±
4.0%, p < 0.05; total: KO 63.1 ± 2.7% versus WT 52.6 ±
3.7%, p < 0.05, n = 7 WT and n = 9 KO) (Figure 2A and
B). Exacerbated hemispheric swelling was observed in
CaMKK β KO females (10.82 ± 1.94% in WT versus
16.74 ± 1.59% in CaMKK β KO, n = 7 WT and n = 9 KO)
(Additional file 1: Figure S1A). These larger infarcts and
exacerbated hemispheric swelling contributed to increased
neurological deficit scores, demonstrating a worse functional outcome (Additional file 2: Table S1). Furthermore,
knockout of the CaMKK β gene increased hemorrhagic
transformation as measured by a hemoglobin assay
72 hours after stroke (85.0 ± 5.5 μg/hemisphere in the
WT (n = 7) versus 181.7 ± 28.7 μg/hemisphere in the
KO (n = 9), p < 0.05) (Figure 2C and D). No difference
was observed in mortality rates between CaMKK β KO
and WT mice after stroke.
To confirm that gonadal estrogen was reduced, we
weighed the uterus 13 days after the mice underwent
ovariectomy. Uterine weights were significantly decreased
in both OVXed WT and OVXed CaMKK β KO mice
(25.5 ± 1.9 mg for OVXed WT (n = 7) versus 96.7 ±
20.0 mg for WT sham (n = 5), p < 0.05; 26.2 ± 1.7 mg for

CaMK IV knockout worsened stroke outcome

Loss of CaMKK β or CaMK IV increased gelatinase activity
and reduced collagen IV levels 6 hours after stroke

Knockout of CaMK IV significantly increased the size of
infarcts in the cortex, the striatum and total hemisphere
at 72 hours after stroke onset (cortex: 66.1 ± 3.1% in the
KO versus 56.5 ± 2.6% in the WT, p < 0.05, striatum:
72.6 ± 3.4% in the KO versus 60.0 ± 2.5% in the WT,
p < 0.05, total: 61.6 ± 3.0% in the KO versus 46.1 ±
4.0% in the WT p < 0.05, n = 8 for each group) (Figure 2E
and F). Exacerbated hemispheric swelling was observed
in CaMK IV KO females (11.24 ± 1.68% in WT versus
17.29 ± 2.41% in CaMK IV KO, n = 8 for each group)
(Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Additionally, CaMK IV
KO mice performed worse on neurological deficit tests
(Additional file 2: Table S1). Furthermore, the loss of
CaMK IV significantly increased hemorrhagic transformation as evaluated by a hemoglobin assay 72 hours after
stroke (82.5 ± 8.6 μg/hemisphere in the WT versus
207.3 ± 33.2 μg/hemisphere in the CaMK IV KO, p < 0.05,
n = 8 for each group) (Figure 2G and H). This result was
similar to our previous observation in CaMKK β KO mice.
No difference in mortality rate was observed between
CaMK IV KO and WT mice after stroke.
Similarly, uterine weights of OVXed CaMK IV KO
mice and the corresponding OVXed WT controls were
also significantly decreased compared to mice with intact ovaries (22.8 ± 1.9 mg for OVXed WT (n = 8) versus
102.4 ± 23.2 mg for WT sham (n = 5), p < 0.05; 23.7 ± 1.9 mg

To explore the mechanisms underlying the increased HT
in both CaMKK β KO and CaMK IV KO mice, we examined the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
after stroke onset. Loss of CaMKK β resulted in significantly upregulated MMP-9 levels 6 hours after stroke
(Figure 3A and C, n = 3 per stroke group, p < 0.05).
Similar results were obtained with CaMK IV KO mice
(Figure 3B and D, n = 3 per stroke group, p < 0.05). Furthermore, we used Western blotting of samples from
6 hours after stroke onset to quantify the levels of collagen
IV protein, which is an important component of the BBB
and a substrate of MMPs. Collagen IV levels were decreased in both KO strains after stroke (Figure 3E-H, n = 3
for the sham group, n = 4 per stroke group). Additionally,
in the sham groups, we observed no difference between
the KO animals and their corresponding WT controls, implying that the loss of either CaMKK β or CaMK IV did
not affect the baseline levels of BBB integrity (Figure 3E-H,
n = 3 for the sham group, n = 4 for each stroke group).
Genetic deletion of CaMKK β or CaMK IV reduced p-CREB
and BCL-2 levels 6 hours after stroke

Next, we examined the levels of p-CREB, which is a neuroprotective transcription factor that is activated by CaMK
IV [14]. At 6 hours after stroke, p-CREB levels were

significantly reduced in CaMKK β KO mice when compared to their corresponding WT controls (Figure 4A and
C; n = 2 for the sham group; n = 3 for the stroke group). A
similar reduction in p-CREB levels was observed in CaMK
IV KO mice 6 hours after stroke (Figure 4B and D; n = 2
for the sham group; n = 3 for the stroke group). BCL-2,
which is a downstream target of CREB, has previously
been shown to be beneficial in stroke. We therefore studied BCL-2 levels in both CaMKK β KO and CaMK IV KO
mice. Consistent with the p-CREB data, we observed that
at 6 hours after stroke, BCL-2 expression was significantly
reduced in both KO strains when compared to their corresponding WT controls (Figure 5A-D, n = 2 for the WT
group; n = 3 for each KO group).
Loss of CaMKK β or CaMK IV aggravated the
inflammatory response after stroke

CaMKK signaling has been implicated in immune regulation, which plays a pivotal role in determining stroke

outcome. Therefore, we measured serum levels of IL-6
and TNFα in CaMKK β and CaMK IV KO mice 72 hours
after stroke. The loss of either CaMKK β or CaMK IV
aggravated the inflammatory response; this was indicated
by increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
TNFα (Figure 6A and B) and IL-6 (Figure 6C and D) (n = 3
for each group).

Discussion
In this study, we utilized OVXed female mice, a translationally relevant model system, to explore the role of the
CaMKK/CaMK IV pathway in stroke. First, we demonstrated that levels of CaMKK β and CaMK IV proteins
in the female brain were equivalent to that in the males.
Second, we found that the genetic deletion of CaMKK β
or CaMK IV aggravated both infarcts and behavioral
deficits. Third, both CaMKK β and CaMK IV KO mice
exhibited increased hemorrhagic transformation after
stroke, and this was associated with both increased

MMP9 activity and the loss of the BBB protein collagen IV. Fourth, transcriptional inactivation was observed in mice lacking either CaMKK β or CaMK IV,
as indicated by the reduced levels of p-CREB and BCL-2.
Finally, we demonstrated that the levels of the proinflammatory serum cytokines TNFα and IL-6 increased
after stroke in both CaMKK β and CaMK IV KO mice, indicating that inhibiting this pathway exacerbates the inflammatory response.
Our data demonstrate that CaMKK signaling may be
an endogenous protective mechanism in females even
though calcium signaling has traditionally been thought

to play a detrimental role in stroke outcome. Dramatic
intracellular calcium elevation results from the hyperactivation of glutamate receptors and concurrent calcium release from intracellular storage [15]. Elevated
intracellular calcium subsequently activates calciumdependent enzymes, including DNases, proteases, and lipases, resulting in cell death under ischemic conditions
[16]. However, clinical trials testing calcium blockers
have failed to provide neuroprotection in patients after
cerebral ischemia [17]. Previous studies have increasingly
supported the idea that enhancing calcium also plays a
neuroprotective role by triggering endogenous protective

pathways, which may explain the failure of these clinical
trials. CaMKK is a major kinase that is activated by
intracellular calcium, and it targets multiple critical
pathways for neuronal death/survival. Here, we have
demonstrated that eliminating CaMKK β or CaMK IV
exacerbates infarcts, edema formation and behavioral
deficits. We have previously demonstrated the effects
of CaMKK in maintaining the integrity of the BBB
after stroke, which is particularly important because
BBB disruption is one of the major contributing factors

A

to edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation
in cerebral ischemia [9,18]. The inhibitory effect of
CaMKK on peripheral neutrophil activation and egress
has been suggested as a possible mechanism for BBB
protection [9]. Additionally, we provide evidence that
CaMKK signaling may function to augment the transcription of neuroprotective genes such as BCL-2. Previous
studies have suggested that deleting either CaMKK β or
CaMK IV in males exacerbates the nuclear accumulation
of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) [9], which may in turn

reduce the levels of the neuronal survival factors p-CREB
and BCL-2 [19-21]. However, a direct link between CaMKK
signaling and the regulation of HDAC4 translocation in females after stroke has not yet been established. Of note,
endothelial cell, an important component of the neurovascular unit, may contribute to stroke outcome, particularly
changes of BBB integrities after stroke. Interestingly, endothelial cells also express CaMKK [9]. Based on our data
demonstrating a worse BBB in the KO after stroke, we
speculate that inhibition of CaMKK signaling may enhance
endothelia cell death and may contribute to greater HT observed in the KO mice. However, the role of CaMKK in
endothelium under ischemic stress is still unclear and remains to be investigated.
Our data highlighted the importance of CaMKK signaling in protecting BBB in stroke. t-PA is currently the
only FDA approved drug for stroke treatment but has a
very narrow therapeutic window due to its risk of inducing HT. It would be very interesting in the future to
study if targeting CaMKK signaling help reduce the risk

of HT and extend the therapeutic window of t-PA. Indeed, bigger infarcts in KO mice may lead to worse BBB
disruption and subsequently higher levels of hemoglobin
in stroke brain. We therefore did a correlation analysis
(data not shown) to see if higher amounts of hemoglobin
is correlated to higher infarct volumes in both KO mice.
No significant correlation was observed although there
was a trend toward statistical significance in the CaMKK
β KO mice (p = 0.11). We chose 6 hour time point to
examine the changes of MMP activity and BBB protein
levels et al., as at this time point, stroke infarct is not yet
mature. Therefore changes in molecule signaling are more
likely to be mechanistic than only a correlation with infarct size. Additionally, our previous published data suggested at this time point, there were significance changes
of molecule signaling in males in CaMKK KO and CaMK
IV KO mice after stroke [9]. In the current study we
would like to see if the similar changes were occurring in
females. We will examine the temporal profile of these
molecule changes after stroke in our future studies.

In addition to its effects on BBB integrity and transcriptional activation, our data demonstrate that CaMKK
signaling may induce neuroprotection through a reduction in post-stroke inflammation. The inflammatory response is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to
stroke damage and is an attractive target for neuroprotective therapies because it takes place in a delayed manner. The CaMKK pathway regulates the activity of several
transcription factors such as CREB, activator protein-1
(AP-1), myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), and members
of the retinoid orphan receptor (ROR) family, which are
all proteins that play pivotal roles in the immune response
and inflammation by regulating processes such as T-cell
development and cytokine secretion [14,22-25]. For example, CaMK IV stimulates ROR α-dependent transcriptional activation, which is responsive to changes in
intracellular calcium in HaCaT cells [22]. ROR α has
been suggested to function as a negative regulator of
cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα because the genetic
deletion of ROR α greatly enhances the induction of
these cytokines in mast cells and macrophages after
LPS treatment [26,27]. Consistent with these earlier
in vitro studies, we found that knockout of CaMKK β
or CaMK IV increased TNFα and IL-6 production in
mice after stroke. Therefore, the exacerbation of the
inflammatory response seen in these KO mice may contribute to their worsened outcome after stroke. However,
the mechanism by which CaMKK signaling reduces the
inflammatory response after stroke and whether ROR α is
involved in this process remains unclear. Of note, in
the current study we only measured the inflammatory
markers in peripheral blood after stroke. Although it is
well established that peripheral inflammatory factors
are able to infiltrate into the brain and exacerbate
stroke outcome, our future studies will directly focus
on the inflammatory response in the brain.
We used ovariectomized KO and WT control mice in
this study primarily because these animals may be a
more appropriate model for women at the highest risk
for stroke, the majority of whom are postmenopausal
[4]. Additionally, performing ovarietomy in female mice
allows us to control levels of gonadal hormones therefore to reduce experimental variability that is associated
with varying estrogen levels during estrus. We confirmed
the loss of gonadal production of estrogen by showing a
dramatic reduction in uterine weights after OVX. However, the direct effects of estrogen on the CaMKK signaling pathway in stroke remain unknown because we did
not directly study stroke outcome in ovary-intact or
estrogen-supplemented OVXed KO females.
Although CaMKK β has been shown to affect hippocampal memory formation in a sexually dimorphic manner [28], we found no overall difference between the
sexes in the role of this pathway in response to stroke.

In fact, deleting CaMKK or CaMK IV at the genetic level
exacerbated the stroke outcome in both males [9] and
females in a nonspecific manner. This suggests that
CaMKK signaling plays a protective role for both male
and female stroke victims. Discrepancies between this
result and an earlier report that found sex-specific differences may result from differences in models or particularly in the brain regions targeted in each case. For
example, the hippocampus is not directly affected by
MCA occlusion, although it may be affected through
secondary ischemia caused by stroke-induced brain
edema formation. We did not specifically assess memory
formation after stroke in females because the primary
focus of our study was to identify whether the CaMKK
pathway can exert neuroprotective properties in female
animals; otherwise, targeting this pathway in females
might fail to reduce injury.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that genetically inhibiting the CaMKK pathway is detrimental in the response of female mice to cerebral ischemia. Therefore,
CaMKK signaling may play a neuroprotective role in
both male [9] and female stroke victims. This result suggests that the CaMKK pathway may be a potential target
for stroke therapy.
