Background Increasing endogenous acetylcholine by neostigmine decreased the ischemic cerebral injury. The off-target
action on muscarinic receptor produced a variety of adverse
effects and limited the clinical application on stroke.
Aim We combined neostigmine with anisodamine and investigated the neuroprotection and mechanism.
Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Neuroprotective action of neostigmine in combination with anisodamine at varying ratios was
examined to determine the optimal combination as well as
ideal therapeutic window. Potential involvement of α7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor was examined by measuring the infarct
size, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the
biomarkers of apoptosis in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
knockout mice. A set of in vitro experiments was conducted in
RAW264.7 cells to probe into potential molecular mechanisms.
Results The neostigmine/anisodamine combination conferred
neuroprotection. The protection was most potent at a ratio of
1 : 500. At such a ratio, the combination increased the binding
of acetylcholine to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and
reduced proinflammatory cytokines. The neuroprotection was
evident only in wild-type and not in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor knockout mice. The combination significantly
decreased the expression of Bad and Bax, and increased Bcl-2
and Bcl-xl in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor wild-type mice
but not in knockout mice. The combination did not affect
caspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, or caspase-12.
Conclusions Current study identified the optimal combination
of neostigmine and anisodamine against ischemic stroke, and
indicated that the acetylcholine-α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor is involved in the protective effects.

largest subtype of stroke. Approved treatments for acute ischemic
stroke include thrombolysis and anti-platelet therapy. Intervention focusing on neuroprotection is promising but has achieved
only limited success upon translation into clinical practice (4).
In a recent study, we noticed significant attenuation of ischemic
cerebral injury upon increasing endogenous acetylcholine (ACh)
by the anticholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (3). Preliminary
evidence in this study also indicated that the neuroprotective
action of neostigmine is mediated by nicotinic ACh receptor
(nAChR) and not muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) (3). The
off-target action of neostigmine on mAChR, however, could
produce a variety of adverse effects, including bradycardia,
abdominal pain, hydrostomia, and bronchospasm. These sideeffects severely limited the clinical application on stroke.
Anisodamine is a belladonna alkaloid that antagonizes mAChR
nonselectively. Anisodamine has less toxic effects than atropine
and less activity in the central nerve system than scopolamine (5).
A previous study from this laboratory also suggested that anisodamine could decrease the levels of inflammatory cytokines
and produce antishock effects (6,7). Because inflammation is
intrinsically implicated in neuronal damage caused by stroke
(8,9), we conducted a series of experiments to examine the potential benefits of combining neostigmine with anisodamine.

Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Sino-British
SIPPR/BK Lab Animals (Shanghai, China). The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) knockout (KO) mice were
obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA, USA)
(B6.129S7-Chrna7tm1 Bay, Stock Number: 003232). All animals
were used in accordance with the guidelines of Second Military
Medical University for Animal Care.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion, neurological
deficit scoring, and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride staining
The rats or mice were anesthetized with 2·0% isoflurane. Middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed as
described (10–12). The core temperature was maintained between
36·5°C and 37·5°C throughout the surgery by using a heating pad
(Nanjing Xin Xiao Yuan Biotech, Nanjing, China). Focal ischemia
was produced by intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral
artery (MCA) using a silicone rubber-coated nylon monofilament
(Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). Cessation of
cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the area supplied by the left MCA was
verified by using a laser Doppler computerized main unit (ML191,
ADInstruments, New South Wales, Australia). Cerebral blood
flow must be reduced by at least 70% for inclusion in further

experiments. Two-hours after MCAO, the occluding filament was
withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after MCAO,
the neurological score was measured as described (10–12). Then
the animals were sacrificed for various examinations.
The coronal slices of brains were prepared with brain-cutting
matrix (ASI Instruments, Warren, MI, USA) and incubated in 1%
2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) at 37°C for 15 min.
Then the slices were photographed with a digital camera. The
infarct size was traced and quantified with ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. The
possible interference of a brain edema in assessing the infarct size
was corrected with a standard method of subtracting the volume
of the nonischemic ipsilateral hemisphere from that of the contralateral hemisphere.
Fluorescent staining of α7nAChR by fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled α-bungarotoxin
RAW264.7 cells (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China)
were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco minimum essential
medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Cells (1 × 105) were inoculated
in 35-mm culture dish (NEST, Beijing, China) and treated with
vehicle (0·9% normal saline), the combination of neostigmine
and anisodamine (1 : 500: neostigmine 0·2 μg/ml + anisodamine
100 μg/ml), or ACh (750 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) at 37°C
for 20 min prior to staining with 1·5 μg/ml of fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 4°C for 15 min. Cells were washed extensively and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde- phosphate-buffered saline solution at 22°C
for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline solution, mounted in glycerol, and
examined under a fluorescent confocal microscope (Leica TCSSP5, Wetzlar, Germany). The data were analyzed using ImageJ
software as described previously (6).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as previously reported (3,13).
Tissue lysate from ischemic penumbra was boiled, subjected to
the sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
and transferred onto nitrocellulose blotting membranes. The
membranes were incubated with one of the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-caspase 12 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA),
cleaved caspase 8 antibody, caspase-8 rabbit mAb, Bcl-xl rabbit
mAb, Bad rabbit mAb, Bcl-2 rabbit mAb, and Bax antibody (six
antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA).
The images were captured by the Odyssey infrared imaging
system (Li-Cor Bioscience, Lincoln, NE, USA) and analyzed by
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
Analysis of proinflammatory cytokines in serum
The serum levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1α (IL-1α) were examined
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Infinite
M200; Tecan Austria GmbH, Grödig, Austria) with a commercial
kit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Statistical analysis
The animals were randomly assigned by using the random permutations table. The investigators were blinded to the procedures
when they assessed the infarct area and neurological deficient
score. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed with Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance.
P < 0·05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Anisodamine, neostigmine, and their combination
confer neuroprotection
To investigate the protective effect and the optimal doses of anisodamine and neostigmine, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO before the drugs injection by vein. Then the
animals were divided into seven groups (n = 10 in each group)
and treated by the following drugs: 10, 20, and 40 μg/kg of neostigmine (neostigmine methylsulfate, Wuhan Yuancheng Gong
Chuang Technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China); 10,
20, and 40 mg/kg of anisodamine (Hangzhou Hejin Technology
Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China). The rate of death
after the MCAO experiments was 13% and did not differ between
the vehicle control group and the groups receiving neostigmine/
anisodamine. Cerebral blood flow reduction was <70% in 15% of
the animal subjects (not included in the treatment assignment).
Three doses of neostigmine (10, 20, and 40 μg/kg) decreased the
infarct size by 15·7%, 25·3%, and 26·3%, respectively (Table 1 and
Fig. 1a). Anisodamine alone (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) decreased the
infarct size by 17·6%, 31·2%, and 31·5%, respectively (Fig. 1b).
Anisodamine at 20 mg/kg was chosen for further experiments.
We also designed three different doses of neostigmine (10, 20,
and 40 μg/kg) combined with anisodamine (20 mg/kg) to investigate their optimal dose ratios. These three combinations
decreased the infarct size by 37·5%, 49·1%, and 62·9%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1c). The reduction of the infarct size was
dose dependent within 10–40 μg/kg neostigmine. We then
designed neostigmine (80 μg/kg) combined with anisodamine
(20 mg/kg). Although high dose of neostigmine in the combina-

tion did not produce severe salivation and dyspnea, the combination decreased the infarct size only by 56·9%. At a ratio of 1 : 500
(neostigmine 40 μg/kg + anisodamine 20 mg/kg), the combination conferred the most efficient protection against stroke. So all
experiments described below used such a combination ratio
(1 : 500).

P < 0·05) when given at 1 and 1·5 h prior to MCAO, but not at 2 h
prior to MCAO (infarct size, 37·2% ± 8·5%; neurological deficit
score 2·1 ± 0·7, n = 7 vs. control P > 0·05).

Dose range and time window
In this series of experiments, 40 rats were divided into 4 groups
and MCAO was performed. Five animals died after MCAO, and
three animals were discarded because CBF reduction was <70%.
These three doses of the neostigmine/anisodamine combination
(10 μg/kg/5 mg/kg, 20 μg/kg/10 mg/kg, and 40 μg/kg/20 mg/kg,
1 : 500) reduced the infarct size by 33·4% (P < 0·05), 45·8%
(P < 0·01), and 62·9% (P < 0·01), respectively. Such an action was
dose dependent (Fig. 2). They also decreased neurological deficit
score from a control level of 3·0 ± 0·5 to 2·1 ± 0·7, 1·9 ± 0·6, and
1·3 ± 0·4 (n = 8 in each group), respectively.
To determine the protective time window for the combination,
the neostigmine/anisodamine combination (40 μg/kg/20 mg/kg,
n = 10 in each group) was injected by vein at 1, 1·5, and 2 h after
MCAO. The combination reduced the infarct size (1 h,

The binding of ACh to α7nAChR
As α7nAChR is a subtype of nAChR and mediates the neuroprotection of ACh and neostigmine (3), we further investigated
whether α7nAChR was involved in the protective effect of the
combination. In vitro study, we labeled RAW264.7 cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled α-Bgt, a selective peptide antagonist that binds to α7nAChR. Strong binding of α-Bgt was
observed on the RAW264.7 cell surface (Fig. 4A-a). Pretreatment
with the combination for 20 min significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity of α-Bgt (Fig. 4A-b). Acetylcholine also significantly decreased the intensity. Interestingly, pretreatment with the
combination for 20 min prior to ACh further decreased α-Bgt
binding in comparison with ACh pretreatment alone (Fig. 4A-d,
P < 0·01). These results indicate that the combination increases
the binding of ACh to α7nAChR.

Fig. 5 The reduction of the release of proinflammatory cytokines by the neostigmine/anisodamine combination is dependent on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (α7nAChR). The levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the serum of α7nAChR knockout
(KO) and wild-type (WT) mice on day 1 after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were examined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data
were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least significant difference post-hoc testing. *P < 0·05; **P < 0·01 vs. vehicle-treated

The neuroprotection is dependent on α7nAChR
The α7nAChR KO mice (three-months old, n = 7 in each group)
were subjected to MCAO then administrated intravenously with
the neostigmine/anisodamine combination (40 μg/kg/20 mg/kg)
or the vehicle (normal saline). The infarct size was significantly
larger in α7nAChR KO mice than in the littermate wild-type
(WT) control (66·3% ± 5·19% in KO mice, n = 5 vs.
36·0% ± 11·6% in WT control, n = 5, P < 0·01, Fig. 4B). The
α7nAChR KO mice also had compromised neurological function
after MCAO (neurological deficit score 3·2 ± 0·8, n = 5 in KO
mice vs. 2·0 ± 0·7, n = 5 in WT control, P < 0·05). The combination decreased the infarct size (21·4% ± 7·6% in drug WT group,
n = 6 vs. 34·8% ± 10·0% in the vehicle WT group, P < 0·05) in WT
mice but not in the α7nAChR KO mice (59·3% ± 15·5% in treatment KO mice, n = 5 vs. 66·3% ± 5·19% n = 5 in vehicle KO mice,
Fig. 4B). Also, the combination treatment did not affect neurological score in KO mice with MCAO (2·6 ± 0·7 vs. 3·2 ± 0·8 in
vehicle KO group, P > 0·05).
We also detected three proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα,
IL-1α, and IL-6, at six-hours after MCAO in the α7nAChR KO
mice and their littermate WT mice. In the vehicle groups, the
serum levels of all these three cytokines were significantly
increased in α7nAChR KO mice than in WT mice (TNFα,
36·2 ± 7·63 pg/ml vs. 24·8 ± 6·85 pg/ml, P < 0·05; IL-1α, 82·4 ±
14·8 pg/ml vs. 63·9 ± 16·2 pg/ml, P < 0·05; IL-6, 134 ± 41·2 pg/ml
vs. 89·4 ± 14·9 pg/ml, P < 0·05 n = 5, Fig. 5). The neostigmine/
anisodamine combination significantly decreased the serum
levels of TNFα (11·6 ± 3·86 pg/ml vs. 24·8 ± 6·85 pg/ml, P <
0·01), IL-1α (41·7 ± 11·9 pg/ml, n = 6 vs. 63·9 ± 16·2 pg/ml,
P < 0·05), and IL-6 (64·9 ± 12·4 pg/ml vs. 89·4 ± 14·9 pg/ml,
P < 0·01) in the α7nAChR WT mice, but not in the KO mice
(Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that the neuroprotection and anti-inflammation of the combination are α7nAChR
dependent.

Decreased apoptosis in the cerebral ischemic
penumbra by the neostigmine/anisodamine treatment
is dependent on α7nAChR
To further ensure the anti-apoptosis effect of the neostigmine/
anisodamine combination and clarify the apoptosis pathway, we
measured the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-8 (related
to death receptors pathway), caspase-12 (endoplasmic reticulumspecific pathway), and some biomarkers (Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xl, and
Bad) involved in mitochondrial pathway (14). First, six α7nAChR
WT mice (three-months old) were subjected to MCAO then
administrated intravenously with the combination or the vehicle
(n = 3 in each group). Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the cerebral ischemic penumbra was extracted for the following detection. The combination treatment did not affect the expression of
caspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, or caspase-12 in α7nAChR WT mice
(Fig. 6). The combination decreased the expression of Bad and
Bax (by about 47% and 36%, respectively) and increased the
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (by 36% and 83%, respectively).
These data suggest that mitochondrial pathway was involved in
the protection. In α7nAChR KO mice subjected to MCAO, Bad
and Bax were significantly increased. The combination treatment
did not affect the expression of Bad and Bax in α7nAChR KO
mice (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Inflammation is an invariable pathophysiological response to
ischemic stroke and contributes to secondary damage (15–17).
Increases in proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase response
appear to predict poor outcome after stroke (8,9,16,18). However,
clinical trials (near 200 in total number) of anti-inflammatory
compounds, including dexamethasone (1971), enlimomab (antiICAM-1 antibody, 1996), and FK506 (tacrolimus, 2004), have
achieved limited success in translation into clinical practice (4).

Fig. 6 The inhibition of apoptosis by the combination of neostigmine and anisodamine is dependent on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR).
The expressions of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, caspase-12, Bcl-2, Bad, Bcl-xl, and Bax were detected in the ischemic penumbra of α7nAChR knockout
(KO) and wild-type (WT) mice on day 1 after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).* P < 0·05,
** P < 0·01, n.s., not significant. Student’s t-test, n = 3 in each group.

One of the reasons for limited success is the complicated mechanisms involved in ischemic stroke injury.
Activation of efferent vagus nerve could widely decrease proinflammatory cytokines (19). In addition to the classical actions of
bronchoconstriction, bradycardia, and gastrointestinal motility,
vagus activation stimulates the release of ACh, which in turn
inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Electrical
vagus nerve stimulation could attenuate the development of
shock, endotoxemia, and ischemic reperfusion injury (19).
In a recent study, we showed that increasing endogenous ACh
could attenuate acute cerebral ischemic injury, via a mechanism
dependent on the nAChR but not mAChR (3). However, nonselective stimulation of both nAChR and mAChR by the cholinesterase inhibitor or the direct vagus nerve stimulation could
produce severe side-effects.
In this study, we showed that adding the mAChR antagonist
anisodamine to neostigmine could attenuate the side-effects of
neostigmine. More importantly, the combination of neostigmine
and anisodamine with a proper ratio had a potent reaction against
stroke. The present study also suggests that the activation of

742

cholinergic pathway and α7nAChR play a key function against
ischemic stroke.
The nAChRs, particularly α7nAChR, are reported to be
involved in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (20,21). It is
well known that the α7nAChR is required for the antiinflammatory effects (19). Our results also identified α7nAChR as
a potent target for stroke. In the current study, MCAO produced
much larger infarct size in α7nAChR KO mice. Also, the reduction
of infarct size and proinflammatory cytokines by the combination
of neostigmine/anisodamine was not evident in α7nAChR KO
mice. More importantly, anisodamine augmented the binding of
endogenous ACh to α7nAChR through its blockade of the
mAChR (22). It also helped us to understand that the protective
effect of the combination was better than the drug alone (Fig. 7).
Minimizing neuronal apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra is
also an important strategy to manage ischemic stroke. Major
pathways for apoptosis include the death receptors pathway,
endoplasmic reticulum-specific pathway, and mitochondrial
pathway (14,22). Cytoprotective Bcl-2 family proteins such as
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL prevent mitochondrial permeability transition

pore opening and release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria, which would result in either apoptosis or necrosis. In
contrast, some pro-apoptotic members, such as Bax, can induce
these destructive changes in mitochondria (22). Results from the
current study suggest that the neostigmine/anisodamine combination reduced the apoptosis might link to the inhibition of the
mitochondrial pathway. It is noteworthy that the anti-apoptotic
effects of the neostigmine/anisodamine combination are also
dependent on α7nAChR.
In conclusion, results from the current study indicate that, at
proper ratio(s), the combination of neostigmine and anisodamine could confer significant and efficient protection against
the acute ischemic cerebral injury by the cholinergic α7nAChR
