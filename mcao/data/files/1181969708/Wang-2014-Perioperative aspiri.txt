Perioperative aspirin improves neurological
outcome after focal brain ischemia possibly via
inhibition of Notch 1 in rat
Zhongxing Wang1,2, Wenqi Huang2 and Zhiyi Zuo1*

Abstract
Background: Perioperative discontinuation of aspirin is often considered due to bleeding concern. We determined
whether this discontinuation affected neurological outcome after brain ischemia.
Methods: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-minute right middle cerebral arterial occlusion
(MCAO). They received 30 mg/kg/day aspirin via gastric gavage: 1) for 2 days at 5 days before MCAO; 2) for 2 days
at 5 days before MCAO and for 3 days after MCAO; 3) for 7 days before MCAO; or 4) for 7 days before MCAO and
for 3 days after MCAO. Neurological outcome was evaluated 3 days after the MCAO. Ischemic penumbral cortex
was harvested 1 or 3 days after MCAO for determining Notch intracellular domain (NICD), IL-6 and IL-1β levels.
Results: Aspirin given by regimen 2 and 3 but not by regimen 1 improved neurological outcome. Neuroprotection
was achieved by N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a Notch activation
inhibitor. DAPT and aspirin given only by regimen 2 and 3 reduced NICD, IL-6 and IL-1β in the ischemic penumbral
cortex. NICD was found in microglial nuclei. Microglial activation in the ischemic tissues was inhibited by aspirin.
Conclusion: Aspirin use during the perioperative period provides neuroprotection. Inhibition of Notch activation
and neuroinflammation may contribute to the neuroprotection of aspirin.

Introduction
Aspirin is commonly used in patients who have risks for
cardiovascular events [1]. It can reduce cardiovascular
events through multiple mechanisms including antiplatelet actions [2,3]. Studies have shown that giving
aspirin before or repeated doses after brain ischemia reduces brain infarct volume and neurological deficits
[4,5]. However, aspirin may be discontinued during the
perioperative period due to the concern of bleeding in
the wound [6,7]. It is not clear whether this discontinuation affects the neurological outcome if an episode of
brain ischemia occurs, which is not an infrequent event
during the perioperative period.

The mechanisms for aspirin to improve neurological
outcome after brain ischemia are not clear. One possible
mechanism is to reduce neuroinflammation that is a
major secondary insult to cause cell injury after brain ischemia [8]. Aspirin has been shown to reduce brain
ischemia-induced neuroinflammation [9]. However, it is
not clear how aspirin can reduce neuroinflammation.
Recently, it has been shown that brain ischemia can activate Notch, which then contributes to induce neuroinflammation [10].
Based on the above information, we hypothesize that
discontinuation of aspirin use during the perioperative
period abolishes the neuroprotective effects of aspirin and
that the aspirin-induced neuroprotection is mediated by
reducing Notch activation and the subsequent neuroinflammation. To address these hypotheses, we simulated
different clinical scenarios of perioperative aspirin use and
subjected rats to a transient focal brain ischemia. The

Notch 1 activation was assessed by measuring the level of
Notch intracellular domain (NICD).

Materials and methods
The animal protocol was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Virginia (Charlottesville, VA, USA). All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publications number 80–23, revised in 1996). Efforts were
made to minimize the number used and suffering of animals. Our manuscript was written up in accordance with
the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments.

Experimental protocols

Four experiments were performed. In experiment 1, male
Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 270 to 300 g (Charles River
Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) were randomly
assigned to receive aspirin (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO, USA) via gastric gavage at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day
(Figure 1): 1) for 2 days at 5 days before a 90-minute
right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); 2) for
2 days at 5 days before the MCAO and then for 3 days
starting from the surgery day to create the MCAO; 3) for
7 days before the MCAO; and 4) for 7 days before the
MCAO and for 3 days starting from the surgery day to
create the MCAO. An additional group was included in
the randomization. This group of rats received saline via

gastric gavage for 10 days during the peri-MCAO period.
The neurological outcome was evaluated 3 days after the
MCAO (n = 10 per group).
Experiment 2 was performed in a similar way as for
experiment 1 but without the second and the fourth aspirin regimen. A sham operated group was included in
this experiment (Figure 1). The right frontal cortex area
1 (Fr1) was harvested at 24 hours after the MCAO to
measure NICD by western blot and the levels of IL-6
and IL-1β by ELISA (n = 8).
In experiment 3, N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT; Sigma Aldrich), a
Notch activation inhibitor, was used. Rats were randomly divided into five groups (Figure 1). This included
the saline group and the groups with aspirin regimen 2
and 4 as described for experiment 1. In the DAPT
group, 0.03 mg/kg DAPT was injected into right cerebral ventricle immediately after the 90-minute MCAO.
The fifth group was the combination of DAPT therapy
and the aspirin treatment of regimen 4. Neurological outcome was evaluated at 3 days after the MCAO (n = 6).
Experiment 4 was performed in the same way as for
experiment 3. In addition, a sham operated group was
included (Figure 1). The right Fr1 was harvested at 3 days
after MCAO for measuring the expression of NICD, IL6 and IL-1β (n = 8).
Drug application

Aspirin solution (6 mg/ml) was prepared freshly each
day by dissolving the powder in normal saline. Application of 1.5 ml aspirin solution or saline was performed
to rats in the morning via gastric gavage (Fine Science
Tools, Foster City, CA, USA).
DAPT solution (1 μg/μl) was prepared by dissolving
DAPT powder in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn,
NJ, USA). The solution was filtered and stereotactically
injected into the right cerebral ventricle using the following coordinates: −0.8 mm anteroposterior, ±1.5 mm mediolateral, and −4.5 mm dorsoventral from the bregma [11].
The rats that did not require DAPT injection in experiments 3 and 4 received injection of the vehicle for DAPT
in the same way.
Transient middle cerebral arterial occlusion

Right MCAO was created as we have described before
[12]. Briefly, rats were induced with isoflurane, intubated
and mechanically ventilated with 2% isoflurane. A
temperature probe was placed in the temporalis muscle.
A servo-controlled warming blanket was used to maintain the temporalis muscle temperature at 37°C. The
MCAO was achieved by advancing a 3–0 monofilament
nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd, Beijing,
China) with a rounded tip to the right internal carotid

artery via the external carotid artery until slight resistance was felt. Rat’s heart rate and pulse oximeter oxygen
saturation were monitored continuously and noninvasively using a MouseOX Murine Plus Oximeter System
(Starr Life Sciences Corporation, Oakmont, PA, USA).
Isoflurane anesthesia was stopped once the suture was
in place. Rats were re-anesthetized by isoflurane at
90 minutes after the onset of MCAO to remove the suture. All animals with surgery received infiltration to the
surgical wound with 0.25% bupivacaine before general
anesthesia was stopped.
Evaluation of motor coordination, neurological deficit
scores, infarct volumes and hemorrhagic volumes

Motor coordination was evaluated by using an accelerating rotarod as we have described before [13]. Each rat
was tested three times in the formal test. The latency
and speed of the rat falling off the rotarod were recorded. The speed–latency index (latency in seconds ×
speed in rpm) of each of the three tests was calculated
and averaged for reporting.
Neurological deficit scores were evaluated by a person
blinded to the group assignment based on an eight-point
scale as we have described before [14,15].
Infarct volumes were measured after staining of the
2-mm thick slices with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride as we have described before [14,15]. The percentage of infarct volumes in the ipsilateral hemisphere
volume was calculated to account for cerebral edema
and differential shrinkage from brain ischemia and tissue processing and to correct for individual differences
in brain volumes. The hemorrhagic volumes were measured in the same way as for measuring infarct volumes, but measurements were performed before the
slices were stained by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride because the staining process would wash away
blood in the brain slices.
Brain tissue harvesting

Rats were killed by deep isoflurane anesthesia and transcardially perfused with normal saline at 1 day or 3 days
after the MCAO. The Fr1, an ischemic penumbral region in this model [15], between bregma + 2 and 0 mm
was harvested for Western analysis of NICD expression
and ELISA of IL-6 and IL-1β.
Western analysis

Fr1 tissues were homogenized in buffer A (10 mM HEPES,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.05% NP40,
pH 7.9) with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml aproteinin,
5 mg/ml peptastin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride) on ice as we have described
before [16]. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C at

and used for Western blotting.
The primary antibodies used were the rabbit antiNotch1 NICD antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and the rabbit anti-β-Actin
antibody (1:4000; Cell Signaling Technology). A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (1:5,000; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was used.
The protein bands were visualized with the enhanced
chemiluminescence methods. Quantitative analysis of the
protein bands was performed using an Image-Quant 5.0
GE Healthcare Densitometer (GE Healthcare, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). The densities of NICD protein bands were normalized to those of β-Actin proteins from the same sample to control for errors in protein sample loading and
transferring during Western analysis.

temperature in a dark room. To stain Iba-1 for its colocalization with NICD, sections were incubated with goat
polyclonal anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA) and then donkey anti-goat IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; Invitrogen). For glial

(1:300; Abcam) and the donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody

ELISA assay of cytokines in the brain tissues

IL-1β and IL-6 levels in the Fr1 tissues were determined
with Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
as we have described before [17,18]. Briefly, brain tissues
were homogenized on ice in 20 mMTris–HCl buffer
(pH 7.3) containing protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml aproteinin, 5 mg/ml peptastin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM
phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 150,000 g for 2 hours
at 4°C. Bradford protein assay of the supernatant was performed for each sample. The supernatant was used in
ELISA. The quantity of IL-1β and IL-6 in each brain sample was standardized to its protein contents.
Immunofluorescent staining

The staining and quantification of the staining were performed as we have described before [19]. Briefly, rats
were killed by deep isoflurane anesthesia and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde at 1 day after
the MCAO. Brains were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 18 hours and then embedded in
paraffin. Coronal sections at 5 μm were mounted on
slides. Antigen retrieval was performed in sodium citrate
buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0)
at 95 to 100°C for 20 minutes. The sections were then
incubated with 5% normal donkey serum and 1% bovine
serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 2 hours at
room temperature.
To stain ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1
(Iba-1) for its quantification, the sections were incubated
at 4°C overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:500; Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA,
USA) and then rinsed in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.025% triton-X 100. The donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; Invitrogen,

donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with NL557
(1:200; R&D Systems) were applied. Images were acquired
with a fluorescence microscope with a charge-coupled
device camera. A negative control omitting the incubation with the primary antibody was included in all
experiments.
For quantification of Iba-1 staining, three independent
microscopic fields in each section were randomly acquired in the Fr1 area, and three sections per rat were
imaged. The number of pixels per image with intensity
above a predetermined threshold level was considered to
be positively stained areas. This measurement was performed by using the Image J 1.47n software. The degree
of positive immunoreactivity was reflected by the percentage of the positively stained area in the total area of
the image. All quantitative analyses were performed in a
blinded fashion.

Statistical analysis

Parametrical data are presented as means ± SEM. The
results of speed–latency index ratio, infarct volume,
edema index, western blotting, ELISA and Iba-1 immunofluorescent staining were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey test. Neurologic deficit scores were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance on ranks, followed by the Tukey test. A P < 0.05
was accepted as significant. All statistical analyses were

performed using the SigmaStat program (SYSTAT Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA).

Results
No animals had an episode of hypoxia (defined as oxygen saturation of arterial blood <90%) during the surgery
to create MCAO. Use of aspirin for 2 days at 5 days before the brain ischemia did not affect the brain infarct
volumes and neurological functions. However, aspirin
use for 2 days at 5 days before the brain ischemia and
then for 3 days starting from surgery day to induce the
brain ischemia, use of aspirin for 7 days only before the
brain ischemia or continuation of aspirin use throughout
the perioperative period significantly reduced brain infarct volumes and improved neurological functions as
measured by rotarod performance and neurological deficit scores (Figure 2).
There was a significant increase of NICD, IL-6 and IL1β in the ischemic penumbral tissues. These increases
were inhibited by continuous use of aspirin during the
perioperative period and were not affected by aspirin use
for 2 days at 5 days before the brain ischemia (Figure 3).
Similarly, continuous use of aspirin during the perioperative period inhibited the increase of Iba-1, a microglial marker, in the ischemic penumbra (Figure 4).
Interestingly, NICD positive staining in the ischemic penumbra appeared in the nuclei of cells that were also positively stained for MAP-2, Iba-1 and GFAP (Figure 5).

MAP-2 and GFAP are markers for neurons and astrocytes, respectively.
Application of DAPT, a Notch activation inhibitor, immediately after brain ischemia reduced brain infarct volumes and edema as well as improved neurological
functions. Similar results were observed with aspirin use
for 2 days at 5 days before the brain ischemia and then
for 3 days starting from surgery day to induce the brain
ischemia, continuation of aspirin use throughout the

perioperative period, and the combination of DAPT and
aspirin use throughout the perioperative period. These
uses of aspirin and DAPT had a trend of reducing
hemorrhagic volumes but none of these reductions
reached statistical significance (Figure 6).
As expected, DAPT significantly reduced the expression
of NICD, IL-6 and IL-1β in the ischemic penumbral brain
tissues. Similarly, aspirin use for 2 days at 5 days before the
brain ischemia and then for 3 days starting from surgery

day to induce the brain ischemia, continuation of aspirin
use throughout the perioperative period, and the combination of DAPT and aspirin use throughout the perioperative period also reduced the expression of NICD, IL-6 and
IL-1β in the ischemic penumbral brain tissues (Figure 7).

Discussion
Perioperative stroke rate ranges from 0.2% in patients
after total joint arthroplasty [20] to 3.3% in patients after
carotid endarterectomy [21]. Although the preventive effects of aspirin on cardiovascular events are well documented [1], discontinuation of aspirin use during the
perioperative period is often considered due to the concern of bleeding [6]. In fact, the new guidelines from the
American College of Chest Physicians include discontinuation of aspirin use for 7 to 10 days before the surgery for patients with low risks for cardiovascular events
[7]. However, it is not clear whether discontinuation of
aspirin during the perioperative period affects the neurological outcome if brain ischemia occurs. Our results
clearly showed improved neurological outcome by continuation of the aspirin regimen. An alternative approach
to achieve this beneficial effect is to start aspirin therapy
immediately after brain ischemia if aspirin regimen has
to be stopped prior to surgery because our study showed
that aspirin therapy for 2 days at 5 days before the
MCAO and then for 3 days starting from surgery day to

Page 8 of 10

create the MCAO also improved the neurological outcome. Similarly, aspirin use only before the brain ischemia for 7 days also provided significant protection,
suggesting that post-brain ischemia aspirin use may not
be critical for the protection.
Neuroinflammation is a major secondary insult to
cause cell injury and death after brain ischemia [8]. A recent study suggests that Notch activation plays an important role in neuroinflammation after brain ischemia
[10]. When Notch in the plasma membrane is bound
with its ligands presented by a neighboring cell, Notch is
activated. This activation produces NICD that can travel
to nuclei to induce expression of various genes including
proinflammatory cytokines [22]. Our studies showed
that NICD was increased in the ischemic penumbral tissues and that this increase was abolished by DAPT.
DAPT also inhibited the increased IL-6 and IL-1β in the
ischemic tissues and improved neurological outcome.
These results suggest that brain ischemia-induced Notch
activation and the subsequent proinflammatory cytokines contribute to ischemic brain injury. Consistent
with this finding, our previous study showed a critical
role of IL-1β in ischemic brain injury [23].
Our studies also showed that aspirin reduced NICD,
IL-6 and IL-1β in the ischemic brain tissues. In addition,
the combination of aspirin and DAPT did not provide
better neuroprotection than DAPT or aspirin alone.

These results suggest that inhibition of Notch activation
in the ischemic penumbral brain tissues contributes to
the neuroprotection of aspirin. In supporting this suggestion, microglial activation as reflected by increased
Iba-1 expression in the ischemic brain tissues was inhibited by aspirin use. Microglial activation in the ischemic
brain tissues is known to be mediated by Notch signaling [10]. Consistent with this knowledge, our study
showed that NICD was expressed in the nuclei of microglial cells in the ischemic brain tissues. However, the
Notch signaling in the neurons and astrocytes of these
tissues may also be activated because NICD was found
in their nuclei as well. These cells participate in inflammatory responses in the brain because they also can produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β [18].
In addition to anti-inflammatory effects, aspirin is
antipyretic. This effect may also contribute to its neuroprotection because brain ischemia often induces pyrexia
that can worsen neurological outcome. However, the
pyrexia caused by brain ischemia in rats is resistant to
aspirin [24,25]. Thus, the antipyretic effects may not be
a mechanism for the neuroprotection induced by aspirin
in our study.
Multiple effects in addition to the anti-inflammatory
effects may contribute to the neuroprotection of aspirin.
For example, aspirin has been shown to preserve ATP
levels and reduce extracellular glutamate levels in the ischemic brain tissues [9,26]. This effect can attenuate glutamate excitotoxicity, a major secondary insult leading
to cell injury after brain ischemia [8]. Also, peripheral
immune responses to stroke can affect the degree of ischemic brain injury [27]. We chose systemic aspirin use
to simulate the clinical situation. This use may affect the
peripheral immune responses to provide neuroprotection that was observed in this study.
Aspirin use may cause significant bleeding in the surgical wound [6] or intracranial tissues [28,29]. However,
the hemorrhagic volumes in the brain tissues were not affected by aspirin use in our study. Future studies are
needed to determine whether aspirin increases hemorrhagic
transformation in the ischemic brain tissues.
Therapeutic dosages of aspirin in humans for relieving
pain and fever are 325 to 650 mg orally or rectally every
4 hours as needed. The dosages for similar purposes in
rats are 100 to 150 mg/kg orally every 4 hours as needed
[30,31]. Prophylactic doses of aspirin are 75 to 325 mg
orally once every day in humans. We used 30 mg/kg aspirin orally once a day in rats in this study, which should
fall into the prophylactic dosage window in rats.
In summary, we have shown that continuation of aspirin
use improves neurological outcome after focal brain ischemia. This effect may be mediated by inhibition of Notch
activation and the subsequent proinflammatory cytokine
production in the ischemic penumbral brain tissues.
