prominent with tMCAO, and ipsilateral preconditioning was more effective than contralateral preconditioning (% of hemispheric volume, mean7SD: 31.973.7 to 19.0710.3

Ischemic preconditioning was associated with a successive bilateral up-regulation of
superoxide dismutases which may be involved in the development of ischemic tolerance.
Our data suggest that a focal ischemic brain lesion induces neuroprotective mechanisms in
extensive brain areas and thus cause bilateral ischemic tolerance within a certain time

As for other organs, preconditioning with a sublethal noxious

and comprises of two time windows, with cerebral tolerance
usually following the delayed pattern. Early tolerance occurs
within minutes to hours after preconditioning whereas
delayed tolerance starts at 24 h and lasts up to 7 days. An

focal or global ischemia itself, but also by a multitude of
stimuli (e.g. spreading depression, hypoxia, hypo- and
hyperthermia, inﬂammation, anesthetics; Gidday, 2006;
Stetler et al., 2008) that are not necessarily endogenous to
the brain (i.e. “remote preconditioning”; Hausenloy and Yellon,
2008; Ren et al., 2008). Several factors have been identiﬁed that
probably mediate this adaptive response, including heat shock
proteins (HSP70, HSP27), hypoxia-inducible factor isoform 1α,
adenosin A1 receptor mediated opening of KATP channels,
immediate early genes, protein kinases (MAPK, Akt, PKC),
NMDA receptor activation, anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2),
inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6), growth factors
(e.g. BDNF) as well as antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases, metallothioneins; Gidday, 2006; Stetler et al., 2008).
For focal preconditioning, such mediators are activated almost
exclusively in the affected ipsilateral hemisphere (Glazier
et al., 1994; Welsh et al., 1992). Interestingly, we previously
observed a transient bilateral induction of both intracellular
isoforms of superoxide dismutases (SODs), the constitutive Cu/
Zn–SOD and the inducible Mn–SOD, after unilateral cortical
ischemic lesions (Bidmon et al., 1997; Bidmon et al., 1998).
These enzymes effectively detoxify reactive oxygen species
(ROS) which are one of the key mediators of cellular damage
following ischemia and reperfusion (Chan, 2001; Chen et al.,
2011). Consequently, studies applying transgenic or pharmacological approaches to interfere with SOD activity have
provided compelling evidence for a role of SOD in neuroprotection against ischemic injury (Chen et al., 2011; Huang et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 1989).
In the present study we investigated whether a unilateral
focal ischemic lesion also protects the contralateral hemisphere
from a subsequent severe ischemic injury. We induced a small
cortical photothrombosis as preconditioning stimulus and evaluated the infarct volume resulting from a subsequent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; transient, permanent) inﬂicted
either ipsi- or contralaterally to the photothrombosis. In parallel, we analyzed SOD immunoreactivity in response to focal
ischemic preconditioning, both before and after induction of the
severe insult, which may help to understand the involvement
of these enzymes in the development of ischemic tolerance.

Results

All animals subjected to the photothrombotic brain lesion or
the corresponding sham procedure recovered quickly without
suffering weight loss or any apparent gross impairment. Four
of the animals treated by pMCAO died within the ﬁrst 24 h.
Additional 14 animals showing one or more of the following
deviations were excluded from the study: hypo- or hyperthermia (deﬁned as o36.0 1C or o39.4 1C rectal temperature)
50 min after MCAO (n¼4); bleeding during MCAO procedure
(n¼ 1); lack of arterial backﬂow during ﬁlament removal (n¼2);
lack of a photothrombotic lesion (n¼2) or lack of infarction
after MCAO (n¼ 4); subarachnoid or epidural bleeding (n¼ 3;
probably as a consequence of an incorrectly advanced
ﬁlament).
Preconditioning signiﬁcantly reduced the size of a subsequent infarct independent of whether it was induced ipsi- or
contralaterally to the lethal ischemia. With tMCAO, ipsilateral

55

preconditioning reduced the size of the infarct by 40.5% and
contralateral preconditioning reduced it by 28.0%. With
pMCAO, the relative infarct volume was 27.0% smaller after
ipsilateral preconditioning and 17.9% smaller after contralateral preconditioning. For statistical comparison of the
volumetric values see Fig. 1 and Table 1. Both tMCAO and
pMCAO caused severe ischemic damage of the subcortical
caudoputamen and parts of the cerebral cortex (including
parietal and occipital areas). Cortical tissue “salvaged” by the
preconditioning lesion included mostly dorsolateral and lateral portions of the neocortex (Fig. 1A–C).
We next analyzed the expression of Mn–SOD and Cu/Zn–
SOD at different time points after the preconditioning stimulus. One day after photothrombosis Mn–SOD immunoreactivity preferentially involved the lesion rim (Fig. 2A). Within the
next 24 hours staining expanded to the contralateral area
homotopic to the lesion (Fig. 2B), as has been previously
described (Bidmon et al., 1998). Five days after photothrombosis, Mn–SOD staining was massively enhanced and almost
homogenously distributed throughout the entire ipsilateral
and contralateral cortex (Fig. 2C). A similar pattern of increased
immunoreactivity was observed for Cu/Zn–SOD (Fig. S1; Bidmon
et al., 1997). TMCAO subsequent to an ipsi- or contralateral
photothrombosis additionally increased Mn–SOD and Cu/Zn–
SOD immunoreactivity throughout the ischemic hemisphere
(as compared to photothrombosis alone; Fig. 2D and E, Table 2,
Fig. S1C and D). Sham MCAO rats showed a similar pattern of
SOD-immunoreactivity as native animals (Table 2). SODimmunoreactivity after pMCAO has not been quantiﬁed. The
semiquantitative results of Mn–SOD and Cu/Zn–SOD immunoreactivity are summarized in Table 2.
We furthermore analyzed whether preconditioning affects
the MCAO related body weight loss. Animals that underwent
pMCAO revealed a mean weight loss of 12.670.3% (n¼ 25)
relative to their weight just prior to the onset of pMCAO (i.e.
24 h earlier), independent of whether rats were preconditioned or not (Table 1). Following tMCAO, weight loss was
affected by preconditioning. In particular, rats with ipsilateral
preconditioning lost signiﬁcantly less body weight after
tMCAO compared to non-preconditioned animals (Table 1).
In rats with contralateral preconditioning, tMCAO-induced
weight loss was reduced, though this reduction was not
signiﬁcant (Table 1).
Neurological deﬁcit of the animals was assessed prior to
sacriﬁce. TMCAO resulted in a neurological deﬁcit of 1.470.8
on the Bederson scale (n¼ 23). Subgroup analysis revealed
that ipsilateral preconditioning had a tendency to reduce this
deﬁcit (transient control 1.670.8 vs. transient ipsi 1.070.6).
Following pMCAO, we found no difference between preconditioned and control groups; the mean Bederson score of all
animals was 2.470.5 (n ¼25). Outcome data are summarized
in Table 1.

the ipsilateral hemisphere, and reports on contralateral effects
are rare. Bilateral ischemic tolerance in response to unilateral
focal ischemia has been reported for the hippocampus
(Belayev et al., 1996). The authors used a focal/global approach
applying 2 h of MCAO as preconditioning stimulus followed by
10 min bilateral CCAO 3 days later. Barone et al. (1998)
examined bilateral protective effects of a unilateral 10 min
MCAO, and found no signiﬁcant contralateral tolerance to a
subsequent pMCAO one day later. This lack of signiﬁcant

neuroprotection is not surprising, given that the time course
of cerebral tolerance usually follows the delayed pattern, and
contralateral upregulation of neuroprotective mediators may
be further delayed as indicated by SOD immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the statistical power in the study of Barone
et al. (1998) is weak as authors compared only three nonpreconditioned rats against four preconditioned rats. Nevertheless, contralateral preconditioning tended to reduce infarct
size by approximately 13% (Barone et al., 1998) which comes

close to the 18% observed in our study (group Permanent
CONTRA).
The pathways through which a unilateral focal brain
lesion confers bilateral tolerance to a subsequent lethal
ischemia are currently unclear. Putative mechanisms include
spreading depressions, changes in transcallosal projections,
as well as humoral and systemic factors. Spreading depressions induce a number of molecular changes and are a potent
trigger of ischemic tolerance (Kobayashi et al., 1995; Otori
et al., 2003; Urbach et al., 2006). Since spreading depression
occurs only on the side of the photothrombosis (Dietrich
et al., 1994), they likely contribute to ipsilateral tolerance but
do not explain contralateral effects. It could be hypothesized
that alterations in normal intracortical connectivity between
the lesion site and homo- and heterotopic areas contribute to
contralateral tolerance. Silver impregnation studies have
shown that after photothrombosis there is widespread
degeneration of nerve ﬁbers, extending also to the contralateral cortex, which may induce reactive changes in disconnected cortical areas (Witte et al., 2000). Accordingly, changes
in contralateral SOD expression ﬁrst appeared in the area
homotopic to the photothrombotic lesion, and subsequently
spread across the contralateral hemisphere (Bidmon et al.,
1997; Bidmon et al., 1998). Evidence in support of a humoral
mechanism in contralateral preconditioning is provided by
studies on remote preconditioning, in which a brief ischemia in
one organ (e.g. skeletal muscle) induces ischemic tolerance in
another (e.g. heart or brain; Hausenloy and Yellon, 2008; Ren
et al., 2008). For example, blood transfer from preconditioned
animals to naive acceptors was shown to reduce the size of
subsequent myocardial infarcts both in vivo and in vitro
(Dickson et al., 1999; Shimizu et al., 2009). Factors mediating
this response may be derived from ischemic tissue or blood. In
support of this, it has been shown that following cerebral
ischemia, inﬂammatory cytokines are released from ischemic
tissue into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and systemic circulation (An
et al., 2014; Tarkowski et al., 1999). In particular, TNFα, IL-1ß and
IL-6 have been implicated in ischemic tolerance (Stetler et al.,
2008). Similarly, a focal ischemia induces peripheral immune
responses resulting in altered plasma levels of cytokines and
other molecules, which may confer systemic neuroprotection
throughout the brain (An et al., 2014). It might be reasonably
assumed that the transmission of ischemic tolerance is a
multifactorial process involving interaction between the proposed mechanisms to induce bilateral neuroprotection. In this
regard, our observation that ipsilateral photothrombotic preconditioning seems to be more effective than contralateral
preconditioning could be explained by spreading depression
effects being superimposed to other, partially bilaterally active
preconditioning mechanisms.
Preconditioning induced neuroprotection was more effective
towards tMCAO than pMCAO. This probably reﬂects the fact
that pMCAO hardly leaves much tissue at risk (i.e. penumbra)
for salvage (Hata et al., 2000a, 2000b). It furthermore suggests
that preconditioning protects against harmful events occurring
during reperfusion, e.g. the excessive generation of free oxygen
radicals (Chan, 2001; Chen et al., 2011; Dugan et al., 1995;
Kawase et al., 1999). In support of this hypothesis and conﬁrming our previous data (Bidmon et al., 1997; Bidmon et al., 1998),
we found a progressive bilateral induction of SODs following

the preconditioning ischemia, which increases tissue capacity
to eliminate superoxide. Studies using transgenic mice or
pharmacological approaches to interfere with SOD activity
provided compelling evidence for a role of SODs in the development of ischemic tolerance (Chen et al., 2011; Huang et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 1989). A role of SODs, particularly in protection
from reperfusion injury, has been demonstrated in mice overexpressing Cu/Zn–SOD, in which cerebral infarction was signiﬁcantly reduced after tMCAO but not pMCAO (Chan et al.,
1993; Kinouchi et al., 1991).
Upregulation of SODs could therefore be a sufﬁcient
explanation for the bilateral ischemic tolerance described in
the present study. Whether other factors are also affected
bilaterally and participate in ischemic tolerance either
directly or indirectly is a subject of further investigation.
After focal and global ischemia, animals usually suffer postischemic weight loss and neurological impairments that correlate with the extent of the ischemic lesion (Freret et al., 2011).
Accordingly, we observed the most distinct preconditioninginduced reduction of postischemic weight loss and neurological
impairments in those animals with the most pronounced
reduction of infarct volume, i.e. after ipsilateral preconditioning
and tMCAO.
In conclusion, the present data suggest that focal brain
lesions cause a bilateral ischemic tolerance that may be
mediated, at least in part, by upregulation of SODs. Obviously,
ischemic tolerance constitutes a heterogeneous phenomenon
caused by interplay of several independent protective mechanisms. Hence, it remains a challenging task to reveal the molecular pathways involved in mediation of ischemic tolerance,
especially given the variety in preconditioning stimuli. Moreover,
the synergistic interaction between distinct genes and proteins
that induce neuroprotection needs to be elucidated in further
studies.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Experimental procedure

Animals were housed under 12 h light/dark conditions with
ad libitum access to food and water. Experiments were
carried out on a total of 71 male Wistar rats (300730 g). All
procedures involving living animals were carried out in
accordance with the EC directive 86/609/EEC guidelines for
animal experiments and were approved by the Governmental
Animal Care Committee.
The animals were randomly assigned to the following
experimental groups (n indicates the ﬁnal number of animals
after application of exclusion criteria):
Group “Transient IPSI” (n¼ 7): Photothrombosis in the right
hemisphere on day 0, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the right hemisphere on day 5 (1 h occlusion,
23 h reperfusion), sacriﬁce on day 6. Groups “Transient CONTRA” (n¼ 8) and “Transient CONTROL” (n ¼8): As before but
with photothrombosis in the left hemisphere or with shamphotothrombosis, respectively.
Group “Permanent IPSI” (n¼ 7): Photothrombosis in the right
hemisphere on day 0, permanent MCAO (pMCAO) in the right
hemisphere on day 5, sacriﬁce on day 6. Groups “Permanent

59

brain research 1570 (2014) 54–60

CONTRA” (n¼11) and “Permanent CONTROL” (n¼ 7): As before,
but with photothrombosis in the left hemisphere or with shamphotothrombosis, respectively.
Group “Sham MCAO” (n¼5): Sham MCAO on day 0, sacriﬁce
on day 1.
Additionally, the time course of Mn–SOD and Cu/Zn–SOD
upregulation was evaluated semiquantitatively in native
animals and in animals with 1, 2, and 5 day old photothrombotic lesions (n ¼5–7 animals each).
Photothrombotic brain lesions were induced by the Rose
Bengal technique (Watson et al., 1985). Animals were anesthetized with 2% enﬂurane in N2O/O2 (7:3). A ﬁberoptic bundle
(∅1.5 mm) connected to a cold light source was positioned
stereotactically onto the exposed skull (Bregma  4 mm,
3.5 mm lateral). Light was turned on for 20 min. During the ﬁrst
two minutes Rose Bengal (1.3 mg/100 g body weight at 10 mg/ml
in physiological saline) was injected through a femoral vein
catheter. Sham animals underwent the same interventions,
except that the light was not turned on.
For MCAO, we applied the intraluminal ﬁlament model
described by Longa et al. (1989) with some modiﬁcations.
Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in N2O/O2 (7:3).
The right cervical carotid bifurcation was exposed and both the
common carotid artery (CCA) and the external carotid artery
(proximal to the origin of the occipital artery) were ligated. A
silicone coated 4–0 nylon ﬁlament was inserted into the distal
CCA. The ﬁlament was gently advanced into the internal carotid
artery (ICA) between 16 and 17.5 mm beyond the bifurcation of
the CCA until a faint resistant was felt and secured. The neck
wound was sutured and anesthesia discontinued. Sham MCAO
procedure was identical except for the insertion of the ﬁlament.
For tMCAO, the animals were re-anesthetized to remove the
ﬁlament and to permanently ligate the CCA at one hour after
MCAO onset. Reperfusion was not directly assessed, but arterial
backﬂow through the ICA (as evident just prior to tightening the
ligature around the distal CCA) was checked in all animals,
indicating that no major clots had formed at the tip of the
ﬁlament, which might have resulted in permanent MCA occlusion. For pMCAO, the ﬁlament was left inside the artery until
sacriﬁce of the animals. Body weight of all animals was checked
prior to the MCAO as well as prior to perfusion. Additionally, the
neurological status of the animals was assessed immediately
before perfusion (i.e. 24 h after onset of MCAO) using the scale
developed by Bederson et al. (1986).
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the deeply anesthetized
animals (4% enﬂurane, in N2O/O2, 7:3) were transcardially
perfused with Zamboni ﬁxative containing 0.02% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Brains were removed and postﬁxed for 24 h in
Zamboni ﬁxative without glutaraldehyde. After 48 h cryoprotection in 30% sucrose coronal brain sections of 60 mm were
cut on a freezing microtome (Microm, Heidelberg, Germany).

with the section interval thickness. To minimize edemaassociated errors, infarction volumes were calculated indirectly according to Swanson et al. (1990). Brieﬂy, the volume of
intact tissue of the ipsilateral hemisphere was measured and
subtracted from the volume of the contralateral hemisphere.
The resulting edema-corrected absolute infarction volume
was then divided by the volume of the contralateral hemisphere to obtain the relative infarction volume.

4.3.

SOD immunohistochemistry

A subset of the sections was processed for Mn–SOD and Cu/
Zn–SOD free-ﬂoating immunohistochemistry with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA) using standard peroxidase protocols described earlier (Bidmon et al., 1997; Bidmon et al., 1998). The primary
antibodies directed against rat-Mn–SOD and against rat
Cu/Zn–SOD were produced and characterized by Kurobe and
Kato (1991), and others (Sugaya et al., 1996). Immunohistochemical control sections were processed identically, but
primary antibody was substituted by normal goat serum or
by rabbit IgG1 (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) at the same
concentration as the primary antibody. The photothrombotic
lesion core was frequently lost during the procedure.

4.4.

Statistics

Data were collected blind to condition and statistically analyzed
using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Dunnett-T3 test,
which does not require homogeneity of the variances. Weight
loss data were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni
T-test. All data are given as mean7standard deviation (SD); pvalues were α adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Measurement of infarct volume

Volume of cerebral infarction was calculated on Nissl-stained
coronal sections at distances of  600 mm between Bregma
þ2.0 and  2.0 mm. Using a CCD camera and NIH image
software, the areas of infarction and of both hemispheres
were measured by tracing these regions on the computer
screen. Volumes were determined by integrating the areas
