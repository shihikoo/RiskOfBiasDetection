Background and Purpose—Muscle wasting is a common complication accompanying stroke. Although it is known to
impair poststroke recovery, the mechanisms of subacute catabolism after stroke have not been investigated in detail. The
aim of this study is to investigate mechanisms of local and systemic catabolism and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in a
model of ischemic stroke systematically.
Methods—Changes in body composition and catabolic activation in muscle tissue were studied in a mouse model of
acute cerebral ischemia (temporal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery). Tissue wasting (nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy), tissue catabolism (caspases-3 and -6, myostatin), and proteasome activity were assessed. Food intake,
activity levels, and energy expenditure were assessed, and putative mechanisms of postischemic wasting were tested with
appropriate interventions.
Results—Severe weight loss in stroke animals (day 3: weight loss, –21.7%) encompassed wasting of muscle
(–12%; skeletal and myocardium) and fat tissue (–27%). Catabolic signaling and proteasome activity were higher in
stroke animals in the contralateral and in the ipsilateral leg. Cerebral infarct severity correlated with catabolic activity
only in the contralateral leg but not in the ipsilateral leg. Lower energy expenditure in stroke animals together with normal
food intake and activity levels suggests compensatory mechanisms to regain weight. Interventions (high caloric feeding,
β-receptor blockade, and antibiotic treatment) failed to prevent proteolytic activation and muscle wasting.
Conclusions—Catabolic pathways of muscle tissue are activated after stroke. Impaired feeding, sympathetic
overactivation, or infection cannot fully explain this catabolic activation. Wasting of the target muscle of the disrupted
innervation correlated to severity of brain injury. Our data indicate the presence of a stroke-specific sarcopenia.

troke is the single greatest cause of physical disability in
the adult population, leaving 30% of patients unable to
walk without assistance.1 The main effector organ of physical
capacity is muscle tissue. The disability after stroke, however, is typically attributed to injury within the brain. By
contrast, the structural and metabolic integrity of the muscle
tissue itself are poorly addressed. Weight loss is a common
observation after stroke, both in experimental2,3 and in clinical studies.4,5 This weight loss involves global tissue wasting, but muscle tissue wasting (ie, sarcopenia) is particularly

detrimental because regaining physical capacity largely
depends on global muscle function, bulk, and strength.
Understanding the mechanisms of muscle wasting and developing interventional concepts to prevent or reverse it are,
therefore, of high relevance in an interdisciplinary poststroke
rehabilitation concept.

Background
Several factors are well known to contribute to muscle
wasting in the poststroke phase, such as denervation, impaired

feeding, and immobilization.6 Nutritional deficits are common
in patients with stroke,7 and weight loss of ≥3 kg is associated
with higher mortality.5 Muscle wasting in acute and subacute
stroke may result from direct metabolic, inflammatory, and
hormonal signals.8 Systemic sympathomimetic activation and
bacterial infections are also common after acute stroke, both
carrying catabolic signals. The combined effects result in local
and systemic catabolic overactivation and anabolic blunting.
Accordingly, a distinct pattern of muscle phenotype change
has been observed in stroke, with a combination of atrophy,
apoptosis, and remodeling. This stroke-induced sarcopenia
shows not only some common characteristics but also differences to other disease-related muscle wasting.9 Sarcopenia,
regardless of its cause, is a major complication in hospitalized
patients10 and leads to frailty, delayed recovery, and poor longterm health state.11
Few studies have investigated the metabolic and phenotypic changes in muscle tissue after stroke, and most of these
investigate the long-term changes at ≥6 months after stroke.
Acute and subacute muscle wasting, however, may be even
more relevant for recovery and present a significant and to
date unexplored therapeutic target in patients with stroke.
Notably, metabolic aspects of muscle wasting and sarcopenia are covered neither in European and North American
stroke guidelines12,13 nor in rehabilitation-orientated guidelines.14,15 There is an urgent need for mechanistic studies to
develop interventional strategies for preventing or reversing muscle wasting and improving rehabilitation success in
patients with stroke.
The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate muscle wasting and regulation of catabolic activation
in muscle tissue in a well-characterized murine model in
the acute phase after stroke. We hypothesized that a direct
relationship may exist between the severity of the ischemic
damage to the brain and the catabolic activation. Systemic
catabolic effects were investigated, as well as local changes in
the affected target muscle. Mobility level, energy expenditure,
and feeding patterns in the acute phase after stroke were taken
into account. In addition, putative relevant mechanisms of
poststroke wasting were tested by appropriate interventions:
hypercaloric feeding to counter reduced food intake, blockade
of sympathetic overactivation, and antibiotic treatment to prevent poststroke infections.

Methods
Animal Model
Mice (C57Bl6/N; Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany; n=92, all male,
mean weight, 22.5±1.4 g) were housed in a specific-pathogen-freefacility under standard conditions with food and water available
ad libitum. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced for 60 minutes by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously.16
Sham operation involved all surgical and anesthetic procedures, including application, correct positioning and immediate withdrawal of
the monofilament. Control animals received no intervention at all.
Metabolic and activity assessments were performed before surgery
(baseline) and on day 3 and day 7 after surgery.

Interventions
To investigate the effect of putative pathogenic factors on weight
loss after stroke, we targeted in separate groups either sympathetic

activation by treatment with a β-blocker (propranolol), infection/
inflammation with an antibiotic (enrofloxacin), or impaired food
intake with high caloric feeding on top of ad libitum access to food
and drinking water. Propranolol (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered
at 10 mg/kg dissolved in 0.9% NaCl via intraperitoneal injection
immediately before the MCAO and 4 and 8 hours after the procedure. We previously demonstrated that this protocol results in
effective inhibition of stroke-induced sympathetic activation.17 The
antibiotic (gyrase inhibitor, enrofloxacin, Baytril 2.5% oral solution; Bayer, Germany) was added to drinking water (0.35 mg/mL)
from day 1, a therapeutic regimen that effectively prevents poststroke infection.18 Poststroke infection (in particular pneumonia)
is a common complication of stroke in mouse models,17 as well as
in patients,19 and may contribute to wasting. To counter reduced
caloric intake by reduced feeding after stroke, 1-mL high caloric
fluid nutrition (Peptamen, Nestle Clinical Nutrition Brussels) was
administered by gavage twice daily on top of free access to food
and water.
Groups sizes were planned according to the sample size calculation
(see below) and the following numbers were included in the respective study groups: stroke day 3: 9 animals, stroke day 7: 16 animals,

sham day 3: 10 animals, sham day 7: 8 animals, high caloric feeding:
11 animals, propranolol treatment: 10 animals, antibiotic treatment:
10 animals, and controls: 10 animals.
Animals that after transient occlusion of the MCA did not
show the circling behavior indicative of an incomplete arterial
occlusion were excluded from the study. The mice were randomly
assigned to the treatment groups by an independent person not
involved in surgery or in data analysis. The person evaluating
functional readouts and postmortal analysis was blinded to the
experimental groups.
Experiments were reported according to the Animal Research:
Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. All experiments and procedures were approved by the State Office of Health
and Social Affairs Berlin (LaGeSo Berlin; G 0226/09).

Body Composition
Body composition (fat and lean body mass) was analyzed by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy using the EchoMRI-100 system
(Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX) as previously described.20

Energy expenditure in relation with physical activity was measured using a combined indirect calorimetry system (TSE Systems GmbH, Bad
Homburg, Germany). The respiratory exchange ratio was calculated as
the ratio between CO2 produced (VCO2) and O2 consumed (VO2). The
energy expenditure was normalized to the lean body mass to avoid
the possible confounding effects from diverging body weight and lean
mass. Mice were housed individually, and spontaneous movement was
determined for 24 hours using a 3-dimensional infrared light beam
system (Supermex, Muromachi, Tokyo, Japan). The system allows the
operator to record physical activity as total ambulatory counts and differentiates between true ambulatory counts and fine movements (rearing). Food intake and fluid intake were recorded during this period.21

Muscle proteasome activity was determined by evaluating the
cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates for all 3 major catalytic β-subunits of the proteasome as described previously.23
Gastrocnemius muscle tissue from the contra- and ipsilateral legs
was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer and 40-μg protein incubated with the fluorogenic substrates (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-LeuGlu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin [Z-LLE-AMC] for trypsin-like
activity,
succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin
[LLVY-AMC] for chymotrypsin-like activity, and benzoyl- ValGly-Arg-7-amidocoumarin [Bz-VGR-AMC; Biomol, Hamburg,
Germany] for peptidyl-glutamyl-protein-hydrolyzing [PGPH] activity). The change in fluorescence intensity over time was measured with a fluorometer (Twinkle LB 970; Berthold, Bad Wildbad,
Germany) at 360 nm excitation and 469 nm emission in 5-minute
intervals for 1 hour. The activity, expressed as nmol/mg protein per
minute, was calculated using free amidomethylcoumarin (AMC) as
the working standard.

Laboratory Analyses
Caspase-3 and caspase-6 activity were measured in the gastrocnemius muscle from the contralateral and the and ipsilateral legs
as described previously.24 The fluorogenic substrates (50 μmol/L)
Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-VEID-AMC were added, respectively.
Assay conditions were identical to the proteasome assay. Myostatin
in skeletal muscle tissue was assessed by Western blotting using
primary antibodies (AF788; R&D Systems), as well as appropriate
secondary antibodies according to standard protocols. Interleukin
(IL)-1 α and β, IL-6, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were assessed using a multiplex-assay as described by the manufacturer

Luminex IS 100 system.

Weight loss was observed after MCAO but not in sham-operated animals or in controls (Figure 1A). Weight loss peaked
at day 3 (–21.7±2.2%) and recovery of body weight (starting at day 4) remained incomplete until the end of the study
(–13.9±2.9%). Reduction of body weight at day 7 was the
result of loss of both fat tissue (–27.3±9.0%) and lean tissue
(–12.5±2.8%; Figure 1B). Muscle tissue loss was observed in
skeletal muscle of both the ipsilateral leg and the contralateral
leg. Heart muscle mass was reduced after MCAO when compared with controls and sham animals (Figure 1B, bottom).

Statistics
Using G*Power 3.1 software (Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf,
Germany; http://www.gpower.hhu.de/), a sample size of n=9 per
group was calculated a priori for the primary end point weight change,
a fixed effect, omnibus, 1-way ANOVA with 8 groups, and an effect
size f=0.5, at α=0.05 and β=0.2. Consequently, group sizes ≥9 (range,
9–16) were used.
GraphPad PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA) was
used for statistical analyses. Results are shown as mean±SD for descriptive purposes and as mean±SEM for weight change over time.
Data were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Data with normal distribution were analyzed with
ANOVA followed by Tukey tests for data with normal distribution,
whereas data without normal distribution were analyzed by Kruskal–
Wallis and Dunns tests. Correlation analysis was performed using
Pearson test. A 2-sided P value <0.05 was considered significant.

Caspase-3 and caspase-6 are effector caspases of apoptosis and
increased caspase activity in musculus gastrocnemius indicates
enhanced proteolysis of skeletal muscle. After MCAO, a 2- to
3-fold increase in activity of caspase-3 and -6 was observed in
the leg muscle contralateral and ipsilateral to the brain lesion.
No such changes were seen in sham animals (Figure 2A).

A significant correlation was observed between infarct size in
the brain and caspase activities in the muscle of the contralateral but not of the ipsilateral leg (Figure 2B).
Increased proteasome activity was observed in skeletal
muscle after MCAO in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral leg (Figure 3A). A significant inverse correlation between
cerebral infarct size and proteolytic activation in the muscle
was observed for trypsin-like and for PGPH activity and
showed a tendency for chymotrypsin-like activity. Again, the
correlation between infarct size and proteasome activity was
particularly strong in the contralateral leg but was weaker or
nonsignificant in the ipsilateral leg (Figure 3B). Myostatin,
a key regulator of muscle growth, was elevated after MCAO
when compared with controls (Figure 4A).

was maintained on day 3 and day 7 after stroke. Locomotor
activity pattern was similar in control and in sham animals.
There was a significant increase in locomotor movement after
MCAO on day 3 both at night (activity phase) and at daytime (resting phase) but this returned to normal activity levels
on day 7. The increased activity after MCAO on day 3 can
be attributed to an increase in true physical activity because
both fine movements and ambulatory activity were increased
in these animals (data not shown). The inflammatory factors
IL-6, IL-1 α and IL-1 β were assessed. No obvious and statistically significant signal was observed in stroke animals in our
study. However, minor changes may have been missed because
of the inherent variance of such measurements (Figure III in
the online-only Data Supplement).
The respiratory quotient was elevated after stroke at day
7 (but not at day 3), particularly during the activity hours at
night (representing postprandial metabolism; Figure 5, middle) and was partially elevated during daytime resting periods
(representing basal metabolism). The RQ showed stronger
variability in 24-hour monitoring after MCAO when compared with controls or sham. Total energy expenditure did not
differ between control and sham animals but was reduced after
MCAO on day 3, and further reduced but with a sustained day/
night pattern on day 7 in 24-hour monitoring in both resting
and active periods (Figure 5, bottom).

In animal models, physical activity and food intake are considered to be indicators of well-being or disease burden,
respectively. At baseline, spontaneous activity was similar in
all groups (all P>0.2). No change in 24-hour food intake was

MCAO, which correlated with infarct volume (Figure 4B and

food intake was observed. No correlation was observed
between food intake and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels or
food intake and caspase-3 levels in stroke animals (Figures I
and II in the online-only Data Supplement). Water intake was
monitored but was not reduced in sham and stroke animals

Discussion
This is the first study to investigate muscle wasting and
increased catabolic activation in muscle tissue in the acute
phase after stroke systematically. We show that the severe
weight loss (>20%) results from tissue wasting of both muscle
and fat tissue. Muscle tissue wasting was observed for both
skeletal muscle and the myocardium. Catabolic activation in
skeletal muscle resulted from increased apoptotic activation
(caspase signals), as well as proteolytic breakdown of muscle
tissue (increased proteasome activity of all 3 major proteasome catalytic domains). Myostatin levels were higher after
MCAO than in the control groups.
These findings suggest an upregulation of catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle tissue secondary to cerebral ischemic
injury. This catabolic overactivity is foremost a systemic
effect because both the contralateral and the ipsilateral leg, as
well as fat tissue and the myocardium, showed tissue wasting.
In addition to this systemic effect, a direct and local catabolic
signal may be emitted from the brain damage to the target

area of the disrupted muscular innervation. This is suggested
by the correlation between the severity of the brain infarction
and many proteolytic and apoptotic signals, particularly in the
contralateral, but not in the ipsilateral leg.
This study provides novel insights into the metabolic and
structural changes of muscle tissue after stroke. Although
muscle is the main effector organ of physical ability, relatively little is known about the acute metabolic alterations in
muscle tissue itself secondary to the neuromuscular disruption after a stroke. Physical disability after stroke has traditionally been attributed to brain and upper neuron injury and
was not thought to result in muscular atrophy.8 This concept
has been challenged by recent studies that have revealed
specific phenotypic alterations in muscle tissue after stroke.
Along with muscle atrophy,8 these changes include reduced
capillarization and impaired glucose use,25 proinflammatory
cytokine activation,26 fiber type changes,8 and endothelium
dysfunction.27 Stroke-induced local damage of inhibitory preganglionic pathways of the sympathetic nervous system may
result in massive sympathetic overflow, particularly in the
target tissues, with subsequent metabolic and inflammatory
overagitation.28
Atrophic changes in muscle tissue in hemiplegic patients
are well known. However, the early changes and (mal-)adaptive responses of muscle tissue in the acute and subacute
phase after stroke have not been studied extensively. Indeed, a
recent systematic review searching 17 042 related publications
reported a mere 14 clinical studies with a total of 490 patient
participants, which investigated stroke-induced skeletal muscle changes.29 This survey included both cross-sectional and
longitudinal studies. Notably, none of these studies investigated the early (<6 months) changes in muscle function and
structure after stroke. The dynamics of adaptive and maladaptive phenotype changes of muscle tissue may be most pronounced, however, in the early phase after stroke. Our study
adds novel and crucial information on this early and vulnerable phase of muscle change. Indeed, targeting muscle metabolism early in the early poststroke phase may be of particular
importance for preventing or reversing muscle wasting and for
supporting rehabilitation efforts.

Food Intake, Activity Levels, and Energy
Expenditure
Obvious factors confounding weight loss in stroke are
impaired feeding behavior, diminished food or fluid intake,
and changes in activity levels. These factors have been carefully addressed in our model. We observed a temporal decrease
in food intake after MCAO that normalized with a tendency
of over compensation on day 7. Fluid intake was not reduced
after stroke. Underfeeding leads to a reduction of insulin-like
growth factor-1 which, in turn, may via IRS-1-PI3K/Akt signaling account for an activation of caspase-3. In line with this
physiological signal, in the control group, a significant correlation was indeed observed between the amount of food intake
and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels. This correlation, however, was not found in sham and stroke animals, and insulinlike growth factor-1 levels were not lower in stroke animals
in our study (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Hence, the insulin-like growth factor-1 signal is unlikely to be
the underlying mechanism of increased caspase activity in the
stroke animals.
For activity level, a temporal increase in locomotor activity
with maintained regular day/night pattern was observed on day
3 after MCAO; locomotor activity returned to normal on day 7.
These findings show that the weight changes observed are not
merely the result of stroke-induced immobilization and subsequent inability to feed sufficiently. Moreover, in 1 experimental group, we targeted a potential caloric deficit after MCAO by
high caloric feeding. This intervention did not diminish weight

loss or proteolytic activity in muscle after MCAO. Other
mechanisms of impaired feeding could be involved and cannot be fully excluded here, such as central regulation of appetite, intestinal absorption, or substrate use. To investigate these
mechanisms, however, was beyond the scope of this study and
should be explored in subsequent studies.
Notably, decreased energy expenditure after MCAO was
observed both in resting and in activity periods and was even
more pronounced on day 7 than on day 3. Given the similar
(and even temporarily higher) activity levels observed after
MCAO, the lower energy expenditure may reflect an adaptive

3682  Stroke  December 2014
energy-saving response to the catabolic overactivation and
a countermeasure against further weight loss. Accordingly,
partial recovery of body weight was observed between day
3 and day 7, despite unchanged food intake. The increased
respiratory quotient particularly during postprandial periods
(nighttime) suggests a compensatory effect toward increased
triglyceride synthesis as described previously.30 This effect
corresponds with the observed partial recovery of body weight.

Inflammation and Sympathetic Activation as
Confounding Factors

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Several confounding factors that would also be involved
in postaggression metabolism (such as inflammation, sympathetic overactivity, problems of feeding, and intestinal
absorption) may contribute to the global tissue wasting effects
seen in stroke. A range of factors may account for sympathetic activation, such as physical and emotional stress, pain,
spasms, and disruption of inhibitory preganglionic control in
the autonomic nerve system. The latter is known to result in
an organ-specific and systemic sympathetic overactivation
with subsequent hypertensive episodes, dysrhythmias,31 and
elevated body temperature.32 Sympathetic overactivation contributes to immunodepression, susceptibility to infections,28
and fever.33 Infection, in particular pneumonia, is the most
common serious medical complication in patients with stroke
and leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, such
as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 and increased production
of oxygen radicals. All these mechanisms may contribute to
some degree to increased catabolic signaling and inhibited
anabolic activity in stroke.34 A high bacterial burden has been
observed in the MCAO stroke model,35 and antibiotic regimens have been shown to reduce infections in both animal
studies35 and in clinical conditions.19 Accordingly, we targeted both mechanisms in our study by treating animals with
the β-blocker propranolol or the antibiotic enrofloxacin. As
with high caloric feeding, these interventions failed to prevent weight loss or muscle tissue wasting and increased proteolytic activity. These findings are in line with previous data
from our laboratory.18
Our results suggest that other mechanisms may be involved.
In stroke, a disturbance of the central control of metabolic
balance and local disruption of neuronal signals may have
an added local metabolic effect. In addition, albeit inconclusive, evidence for the existence of a mechanistic link between
stroke-induced brain lesion and systemic wasting emerges
from the correlations observed between brain lesion and lateralized (ie, contralateral) catabolic activation. These catabolic
effects are specific to stroke. To separate the 2 components of
global and local wasting is challenging in an in vivo model.
Additional studies are required to disentangle interrelated
stroke-specific mechanisms from stress or postaggressionrelated catabolic activation in muscle tissue.
There are some limitations in the stroke model that need
to be addressed. We performed this proof of concept study
in young mice. Laboratory mice gain weight throughout their
lifespan, at the age range used in our study up to 2 g/wk, potentially confounding poststroke weight changes. Further confounders of the model are stress from surgery and handling,

as well as anesthesia, factors that are controlled by the use of
sham surgery groups. Additional studies need to investigate
older mice that more closely reflect the clinical population of
patients with stroke and targeted lesioning of specific brain
regions in the left or right hemisphere.

Conclusions
Increased catabolism and global tissue wasting occurs after
stroke and affects skeletal muscle, as well as myocardium
and fat tissue. Increased local proteolysis in the target muscle
of the disrupted innervation is directly related to the severity of the cerebral injury. This suggests that in addition to the
systemic catabolic effects, a direct and local proteolytic signal may occur after cerebral infarction. Common confounders, such as impaired feeding, sympathetic overactivation,
immobility, and infection, cannot fully explain this catabolic
activation. Our data support the concept of a stroke-specific
sarcopenia in the acute phase after stroke. Additional studies
need to identify the underlying mechanisms and target them
therapeutically. Preventing muscle wasting after stroke with
targeted metabolic intervention may be an important principle
to improve rehabilitation and outcome after stroke.
