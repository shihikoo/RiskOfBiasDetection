Overstimulation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors is believed to be responsible for neuronal death of the CNS in various disorders,
including cerebral and spinal cord ischemia. However, the intrinsic and physiological mechanisms of modulation of these receptors are
essentially unknown. Here we report that cholestane-3␤,5␣,6␤-triol (triol), a major metabolite of cholesterol, is an endogenous neuroprotectant and protects against neuronal injury both in vitro and in vivo via negative modulation of NMDA receptors. Treatment of
cultured neurons with triol protects against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, and administration of triol significantly decreases neuronal injury after spinal cord ischemia in rabbits and transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. An inducible elevation of triol is associated
with ischemic preconditioning and subsequent neuroprotection in the spinal cord of rabbits. This neuroprotection is effectively abolished by preadministration of a specific inhibitor of triol synthesis. Physiological concentrations of triol attenuate [Ca 2⫹]i induced by
glutamate and decrease inward NMDA-mediated currents in cultured cortical neurons and HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with
NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors. Saturable binding of [ 3H]triol to cerebellar granule neurons and displacement of [ 3H]MK-801 binding to
NMDA receptors by triol suggest that direct blockade of NMDA receptors may underlie the neuroprotective properties. Our findings
suggest that the naturally occurring oxysterol, the major cholesterol metabolite triol, functions as an endogenous neuroprotectant in
vivo, which may provide novel insights into understanding and developing potential therapeutics for disorders in the CNS.

Introduction
Steroids and oxysterols are ubiquitous lipid components of eukaryotic plasma membranes and play vital roles in regulating the
properties of cell membranes in mammalian cells (Mauch et al.,
2001; Steck and Lange, 2010). Physiologically, the main metabolic pathways of cholesterol involve the biosynthesis of bile acids
and steroid hormones, as well as the oxidation into oxysterols, the
most abundant of which is cholestane-3␤,5␣,6␤-triol (triol;
Javitt, 1994; Payne and Hales, 2004). According to the ancient
Chinese Pharmacopoeia, gallstones from oxen, which mainly contain cholesterol and its metabolites, have been used medicinally

to treat various CNS disorders, including epilepsy (Gu, 1955). In
traditional Indian medicine, animal gallstones have also been
used as drugs for at least 4000 years (Thiyagarajan and Sunderrajan, 1992). More recent clinical epidemiological studies have
shown that higher total plasma cholesterol levels correlate with
lower mortality and better outcomes in patients who have had a
stroke (Iso et al., 1989; Dyker et al., 1997; Olsen et al., 2007). A
recent epidemical research with meta-analysis also revealed that
low cholesterol is a risk of all-cause mortality in Japan (Kirihara et
al., 2008), including stroke.
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability
worldwide, with few if any effective therapies (Al Hasan and Murugan, 2012). Numerous pathophysiological studies have implicated excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors, changes in the
expression and function of these receptors, and/or aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mechanisms of ischemic
neuronal injury and death (Budd, 1998; Mori et al., 2004; Giffard
and Swanson, 2005). It is also generally accepted that disturbances in intracellular calcium ([Ca 2⫹]i) homeostasis contribute
to ischemia-induced neuronal injury and death (Cross et al.,
2010). Overstimulation of NMDA receptors is believed to be responsible for neuronal death in the CNS induced by a variety of
ischemic and traumatic insults. NMDA receptor channelmediated Ca 2⫹ overload, which plays a critical role in neuronal

excitotoxicity, has also been implicated in neuronal death after
spinal cord ischemia (Kocaeli et al., 2005; Villmann and Becker,
2007). NMDA receptors are modulated by many endogenous
and exogenous substances. For example, the amino acid glycine
and many neurosteroids, including 24( S)-hydroxycholesterol,
facilitate the activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate (Fahey
et al., 1995; Paul et al., 2013). To our knowledge, no naturally
occurring NMDA receptor antagonists have so far been identified
or shown to be active in vivo as neuroprotectants.
In the current study, we demonstrate that an endogenous oxysterol metabolite of cholesterol, triol, is able to protect neurons
against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and ischemiainduced neuronal injury in vivo. Triol is also a potent NMDA
receptor negative modulator that may underlie its observed neuroprotective properties. Our findings suggest that the metabolism of cholesterol to triol may serve to reduce neuronal injury
and death after ischemic CNS insults.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Triol and 6-ketocholestanol (KC) were provided by SigmaAldrich. The purity of triol was ⬎99.0%, determined under 1260 HPLC
(Agilent) with an 2000ES ELSD detector (Alltech).
Animals. Sprague Dawley rats (240 –270 g, males) and New Zealand
white rabbits (2.0 –2.5 kg, males) were used. All animals were provided by
the Animal Research Laboratory at Sun Yat-sen University (Guangdong,
China). The experimental protocol used was approved by the Ethics
Committee for Animal Experimentation.
Human blood donors. Six healthy volunteers (20 –30 years old, three
males) provided their blood for triol determination in plasma.
Determination of triol. All plasma and tissue samples were stored at
⫺80°C and determined as soon as possible. Determination of triol was
performed as described previously (Sevanian et al., 1994; Razzazi-Fazeli
et al., 2000) with modification. To avoid oxidation during sample preparation, the whole process was carefully kept away from light and oxygen,
such as solvent degasification and saturation with nitrogen, solvent evaporation under a stream of nitrogen, and addition of butylated hydroxytoluene and EDTA before sample preparation.
A total of 1.0 g of plasma or 2.0 g of 50% tissue homogenate containing
0.9% NaCl was used for analysis, and 3␤,6␤-dihydroxyl-cholestane-24one was used for the internal standard (IS). First, plasma or tissue homogenate was vortex extracted by adding ethyl acetate. After ethyl acetate
evaporated, the residue was dissolved in hexane-ethyl acetate (9:1, v/v)
and loaded onto the SPE column (Sep-Pak Vac, 3 ml/500 mg; Waters).
The column was then washed with 10 ml of hexane-diethyl ether (95:5,
v/v), 15 ml of hexane-diethyl ether (90:10, v/v), and 10 ml of hexanediethyl ether (80:20, v/v) in order. Finally, the column was eluted by 6 ml
of acetone. Then the acetone was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved
in 100 ␮l of methanol. An aliquot of the aqueous layer (10 ␮l) was injected
into the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) system.
The LC–MS system consists of an Agilent 1200 HPLC with a 6120
quadrupole MS equipped with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI) source and operated in positive ion mode. Chromatographic
separation was performed by a XBridge C18 column (250 ⫻ 4.6 mm
inner diameter, 5 ␮m; Waters) at 30°C using a mobile phase of water–
methanol–acetonitrile (6:44:50, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Determination of triol was applied in the selective ion monitoring (SIM)
mode with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 384.7–385.7 and 400.7– 401.7
for IS. Linearity was assessed by triol IS peak area ratio versus the concentrations of triol. All calibration curves were corrected by subtracting
the ratio of triol IS peak area in biological samples. Assay precisions and
recoveries were determined and approved for all tested plasma and tissues.
Cell culture and in vitro experiments. Primary cultures of spinal cord
neurons, cerebellar granule neurons, and cortical neurons of rats were
prepared as described previously (Dichter, 1978; Hughes et al., 1993;
Berman and Murray, 1996). For glutamate exitotoxicity assay, the neuronal cultures were washed three times with Mg 2⫹-free Locke’s buffer
and then incubated with 200 ␮M glutamate and 10 ␮M glycine in Mg 2⫹-

free Locke’s buffer for 45 min. After that, the cultures were washed three
times and maintained in the normal culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin)
for 24 h in the incubator. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the plasmids containing NR1/NR2B subunits using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (Qiu et al., 2005). The survival rate of cells exposed to
various concentrations of triol was measured by MTT assay as described
previously (Sun et al., 2013).
In vivo animal model of spinal cord ischemia. The animal model of
spinal cord ischemia in rabbits was performed as described previously
(Johnson et al., 1993; Celik et al., 2002). Rabbits were randomly assigned
into four groups (n ⫽ 12) as follows: (1) the ischemia group (ISC), in
which the infrarenal aorta was occluded for 20 min to produce spinal
cord ischemic injury; (2) the triol group, in which an intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg triol [10% of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as vehicle] was
administered 30 min before spinal cord ischemia; (3) the vehicle group,
in which an intravenous infusion of the same volume 10% of DMSO was
administered; and (4) the sham group, in which only the aorta was exposed. During the surgical operation, a 22-gauge catheter was inserted
into the ear artery to measure proximal blood pressure, and another
catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery to measure distal blood
pressure. Blood pressure was monitored continuously by using a calibrated pressure transducer connected to an invasive pressure monitor
(Spacelabs Healthcare). Rectal temperature was maintained between
38°C and 39°C by a temperature-controlled heating pad during the experiments. Arterial blood was sampled at the preischemic state, 10 min
after ischemia, and 10 min after reperfusion for the determination of the
partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and partial pressure of
carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2). Arterial blood gases were measured by means of the OMNI Modular System (AVL List).
Both the neurological and histopathological evaluations were assessed
at 48 h after reperfusion. A modified Tarlov criteria (Johnson et al., 1993)
was used: score 0, no voluntary hindlimb function; score 1, perceptible
joint movement; score 2, active movement but no ability to stand; score
3, to be able to stand but not to walk; and score 4, complete normal hindlimb
motor function. For the histopathological analysis, the lumbar spinal cord
was removed, and coronal sections of the spinal cord (L5 segment) were cut
at a thickness of 6 ␮m and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced brain injury in rats. Male
Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n ⫽ 10):
a saline group, a 20% hydroxypropyl-␤-cyclodextrin (HP-␤-CD) group
(vehicle group), and five different therapeutic time windows of triol
groups, respectively. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model and physiological monitoring were performed as described previously (Longa et al., 1989). Briefly, the right common carotid artery and
the right external carotid artery were exposed through a ventral midline
neck incision and were ligated. A 3-0 nylon monofilament suture (Ethicon nylon suture) with a blunt tip was inserted into the internal carotid
artery to a point ⬃17–18 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation until a mild
resistance was felt, thereby occluding the origins of the anterior cerebral
and middle cerebral arteries. Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the suture after 120 min of ischemia. During the surgical operation, the right femoral artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring
of arterial blood pressure and for sampling blood to measure PaO2 and
PaCO2, and rectal temperature was monitored and kept between 37.0°C
and 37.5°C by a temperature-controlled heating pad. The five triol
groups were administered intravenously with 12 mg/kg triol at 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
and 4 h after the onset of MCAO. The saline and vehicle groups were
administered intravenously with the same volume of saline and vehicle as
the triol groups, respectively, at 2 h after onset of MCAO.
After 24 h of reperfusion, each animal was assigned a neurological
score (Longa et al., 1989): 0, no neurologic deficit; 1, failure to extend the
left forepaw fully; 2, circling to the left; 3, falling to left; 4, no spontaneous
walking with a depressed level of consciousness; and 5, dead.
For observation of the persistent neuroprotection of triol, one group
of animals administered triol intravenously at 1 h after onset of MCAO
were evaluated at day 7 after reperfusion.
After the neurological assessment, the rats were anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate and decapitated. Brains were quickly removed

Ischemic preconditioning. Rabbits were randomly assigned into six groups (n ⫽ 10) as

spinal cord ischemic injury; (2) the ischemic

Results
Tissue distribution of triol
In preliminary experiments, we found that rabbits with hypercholesterolemia had reduced neuronal injury and neurological
impairment after spinal cord ischemia compared with rabbits
with normal cholesterol (our unpublished data). However, previous studies, including our own, failed to demonstrate neuroprotective effects of cholesterol itself (Olsen et al., 2007; our

unpublished observations). In many tissues, cholesterol is rapidly
oxidized to cholesterol-5,6-epoxide, followed by hydration to
triol by cholesterol 5,6-epoxide hydrolase (ChEH; Nashed et al.,
1985; Fig. 1A). Triol has been demonstrated to be a major metabolite of cholesterol in humans (Sevanian et al., 1994; Schroepfer,
2000), and triol plasma levels are elevated in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and humans (Schroepfer, 2000; Leonarduzzi et al.,
2005). We next determined triol concentrations in human and
rabbit plasma by LC–MS and found plasma levels of 0.37 and 0.12
␮M in humans and rabbits, respectively (Fig. 1B). We then systematically measured the distribution of triol in various rat tissues. As shown in Figure 1D, triol levels in various rat tissues
ranged from 1.07 to 0.32 ␮M (spinal cord ⬎ liver ⬎ brain ⱖ
kidney ⬎ plasma).
Neuroprotective effects of triol in vitro
Exposure of cultured spinal cord and cortical and cerebellar granule neurons to high neurotoxic concentrations of glutamate
results in a significant reduction in the number of surviving neurons (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of neurons with triol (5–15 ␮M) for
30 min before glutamate exposure increases the survival of spinal
cord motoneurons, cortical neurons, and cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 2B–D) in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, cholesterol itself had no neuroprotective effects at these
same concentrations, and neither compound had an effect on
neuronal survival in untreated neurons (data not shown).

Neuroprotective effects of triol in the ischemia-induced
spinal cord injury model in rabbits
We next studied the possible neuroprotective effect of triol in a
model of spinal cord ischemia in rabbits (Johnson et al., 1993;
Celik et al., 2002). After spinal cord ischemia, we observed a good
correlation between neurological scores and the number of normal motoneurons in the anterior spinal cord 48 h after reperfusion (r ⫽ 0.827, p ⬍ 0.01; Fig. 3A). Neurological evaluation
indicated that rabbits in the triol-treated group (8 mg/kg) exhibited higher neurological scores than those in the ISC (control)
group (average score of 2.50 vs 0.83, p ⬍ 0.05; Fig. 3B). Three
rabbits in the triol-treated group showed completely normal motor function after spinal cord ischemia (neurological score of 4;

Fig. 3B). In contrast, no rabbit in the control (or vehicle-treated)
group showed normal motor function (all neurological scores
ⱕ2). There was no difference in neurological scores between the
untreated control group and the DMSO vehicle-treated group
(average score of 0.83 vs 0.92, p ⬎ 0.05; Fig. 3B). In both the
untreated control and vehicle-treated group, rabbits rated with
neurological scores of approximately ⱕ1 showed vacuolation of
gray matter and disappearance of most normal motoneurons
(Fig. 3C). In contrast, in the triol-treated group, rabbits rated
with a neurological score of 3 showed mostly normal motoneurons (Fig. 3C, arrows), with some eosinophilic neurons (Fig. 3C,
arrowheads). The number of surviving anterior spinal cord neurons in the triol-treated group was significantly higher than those

after cerebral ischemia. As shown in Figure 4, transient MCAO in
rats leads to a large infarct volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere at
24 h after reperfusion, which affects a significant portion of the
frontal and parietal cortices, caudate–putamen, and diencephalon (Fig. 4A). The infarct volume induced by MCAO was 31.53 ⫾
1.69% for the saline group and 29.87 ⫾ 2.52% for the vehicletreated group (20% HP-␤-CD), respectively (Fig. 4B). To explore
a possible therapeutic time window of triol treatment, 12 mg/kg
triol was administrated to rats at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 h after
onset of MCAO, respectively. Triol treatment markedly reduced
the extent of the infarct volume compared with saline- or vehicletreated animals (Fig. 4 A, B) at the all time points. The infarct
volumes were reduced to 7.17 ⫾ 1.43, 9.70 ⫾ 1.20, 10.86 ⫾ 0.84,
14.76 ⫾ 1.25, and 16.98 ⫾ 2.12%, respectively (vs 29.87 ⫾ 2.52%
in vehicle-treated rats). Triol treatment also improved functional
neurological outcome as demonstrated by better neurologic
scores in the triol-treated animals compared with those in the
vehicle-treated ones ( p ⬍ 0.05; Fig. 4C). Together, these morphological and behavioral data demonstrate that neuronal injury
induced by MCAO can be markedly reduced by administration of
triol even if the treatment takes place 4 h after ischemic injury.
Furthermore, the neuroprotection of triol is persistent rather
than temporal, simply delaying cell death, as evidenced by smaller
infarct volumes and better neurologic scores at 7 d after reperfusion compared with those of vehicle-treated rats ( p ⬍ 0.01; Fig.
4D–F ). However, the physiological parameters, such as blood
pressure, blood gases, and rectal temperature, among the surgical
group animals had no significant changes.
Triol mediates neuroprotection after
ischemic preconditioning
We next used a rabbit IPC model to explore the relationship
between neuroprotection and the spinal cord concentrations of
endogenous triol. The rabbits in the IPC ⫹ ISC group exhibit
significantly higher neurological scores than those in the ISC
group (average score of 3.1 vs 0.8, respectively, p ⬍ 0.01; Fig. 5A).
As shown in Figure 5, B and C, the histopathological analysis
further confirmed the marked neuroprotection observed after
IPC. Coincidentally, the tissue levels of triol were significantly
increased at 2 h after the IPC, were approximately fourfold
greater than control levels at 4 h, and remained significantly elevated at 6 h after the IPC (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, after intravenous administration of triol (8 mg/kg), the concentration of triol
in the spinal cord was ⬃1.0 ␮M between 2 and 8 h (Fig. 5H ),
which is approximately fourfold of the basal concentration (0.25

␮M) and equivalent to the highest endogenous triol concentration induced by IPC (1 ␮M, 4 h after IPC treatment).
Pretreatment of rabbits with a specific ChEH inhibitor of triol
biosynthesis (Sevanian and McLeod, 1986), KC (8 mg/kg), 60
min before IPC abolished both the neuroprotection (Fig. 5A–C)
and triol increase (Fig. 5G) induced by IPC. However, as shown
in Figure 5D–F, pretreatment with KC did not exacerbate the
relatively severe ischemic injury (20 min of spinal cord ischemia,
ISC) as well as the mild ischemia (6 min of spinal cord ischemia,
IPC). Together with the observed neuroprotective effects of administered triol in the rabbit spinal cord ischemia and rat MCAO
models, these data suggest that the increase of endogenous triol
after IPC and the neuroprotection induced by IPC are casually
related to one another.
Triol blocks [Ca 2ⴙ]i increase induced by glutamate and INMDA
in cortical neurons
Using laser scanning confocal calcium imaging (Földes-Papp et
al., 2003), we found that triol reduced the [Ca 2⫹]i increase triggered by glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
6 A, B). We further examined the effects of triol on NMDA currents in primary cultured cortical neurons. The formal recording
was not started until three stable current traces were obtained. No
significant NMDA current reduction was observed after recording for 7 min, in the absence of triol (Fig. 6C). In contrast, NMDA
currents were time and concentration dependently decreased by
⬃25% and ⬃60% at 7 min in the presence of 1 ␮M (Fig. 6 D, G)
and 10 ␮M (Fig. 6 E, G) triol, respectively. The “time-dependent”
decrease of NMDA currents by triol is reminiscent of a usedependent inhibition. To provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, we did not activate NMDA receptors between 2 and 7
min (5 min interval, no use) and found, under such a paradigm,
that NMDA current was only decreased by 13.94% at 7 min in the
presence of 10 ␮M triol (Fig. 6 F, G), which was much less than
that of the ⬃60% decrease observed in Figure 6, E and G. Obviously, this inhibition is use dependent: less NMDA receptor use
produces less NMDA current inhibition.
Inhibitory effects of triol on [Ca 2ⴙ]i induced by NMDA in
HEK-293 cells transfected with NMDA receptors
We next transfected HEK-293 cells with NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors and examined the effects of triol on [Ca 2⫹]i induced by
NMDA. As shown in Figure 7A–C, application of 200 ␮M NMDA
fails to increase [Ca 2⫹]i in wild-type HEK-293 cells (Fig. 7A), but
a prominent elevation in [Ca 2⫹]i was observed in HEK-293 cells
transfected with NR1/NR2B NMDA receptors (Fig. 7B). Triol
significantly reduces [Ca 2⫹]i responses in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 7 B, C). MK-801 (10 ␮M), used as a positive control, also reduces NMDA-induced [Ca 2⫹]i elevation. In
contrast, cholesterol (10 ␮M) has no effect on NMDA-induced
[Ca 2⫹]i increases in these same cells.
Binding of [ 3H]triol to primary cultured cerebellar
granule neurons
To further investigate the action of triol on NMDA receptors, we
studied the binding of [ 3H]triol to primary cultured cerebellar
granule neurons. The results demonstrate specific and saturable
binding of [ 3H]triol with an apparent Kd of 279.21 ⫾ 43.88 nM,
whereas nonspecific binding was linear with increased [ 3H]triol
concentrations (Fig. 7 D, E). Finally, we studied the effects of triol
on the specific binding of [ 3H]MK-801 to NMDA receptors expressed on cultured cerebellar granule neurons. We found that

cells (Fig. 7G).

Discussion
In the present study, we found that triol, a major metabolite of
cholesterol that is present in many tissues, including the brain
and spinal cord, has neuroprotective properties when studied in
vitro and in vivo. Although triol was once considered a toxic
metabolite of cholesterol, after prolonged exposure of endothe-

lial cells to high concentrations (Matthias et al., 1987), we found
no evidence that lower physiologic concentrations were toxic to
cultured neurons. In fact, we observed neuroprotective properties of triol in primary cultured neurons, including cortical neurons, cerebellar granular neurons, and neurons from the anterior
spinal cord, when these cells were subsequently exposed to excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate. We also tested triol in a
spinal cord ischemia model in rabbits in which ischemic injury
induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion results in a highly reproducible deficit in neurological function attributable to loss of
spinal cord motoneurons. Parenteral administration of triol before spinal cord ischemic injury markedly inhibited both the behavioral deficits and loss of motoneurons observed after ischemic
injury. Although there exists a rather limited “time window” for
neuroprotective agents after ischemic injury, we observed that
triol can significantly protect against ischemic injury when administered as long as 4 h after MCAO. We also found that the
neuroprotection of triol is persistent rather than simply delaying
cell death, as evidenced by a potent neuroprotective effect of triol
on MACO animals 7 d after reperfusion.
Does triol play a physiological role as an endogenous neuroprotectant? The presence in the CNS of abundant sources of
cholesterol and the presence of its auto-oxidation product
cholesterol-5,6-epoxide, as well as a biosynthetic pathway for additional hydration via CheH (Nashed et al., 1985) and relatively
high tissue levels of triol present in a variety of species support a
potential physiological or pathophysiological role.
Ischemic preconditioning has been used to elucidate endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms (Dirnagl and Meisel, 2008). In
this experimental paradigm, subtoxic ischemic insult results
in subsequent neuroprotection to an otherwise toxic ischemic
injury. A number of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to
mediate the neuroprotective state after the processes of preconditioning (Clarkson, 2007; Zhao et al., 2013; Stetler et al., 2014).
However, the actual functional effecter molecules are still essentially unknown. In the present study, markedly improved neurological and histopathological outcomes were observed after
ischemic preconditioning in the rabbit spinal cord as reported by
a number of laboratories (Yu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2007; Yang
et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2013). Using this experimental neuroprotective paradigm, we observed increased triol concentrations in
the spinal cord up to 4 h after preconditioning. This inducible
increase of spinal cord triol levels was blocked by pretreatment
with a specific inhibitor of triol synthesis, which also blocked the
neuroprotection induced by preconditioning. These observations, combined with our in vitro and in vivo data, strongly suggest that triol may function as an endogenous neuroprotectant,
possibly induced by subtoxic ischemic injury or preconditioning.
However, we found a dose difference of triol between physiological concentrations and the ones used in experiments in vitro
and in vivo. From the point of view of the current methodology,
the dose differences may be associated with the determination of
endogenous triol. The brain or spinal cord concentrations of triol
tested in our study may only represent the average ones of triol in
a tissue homogenate, which may not truly reflect the concentrations in a specific region or a specific subcellular localization,
such as the nerve terminal, in which triol may accumulate to
reach a higher concentration to execute its neuroprotection.
Another potential factor responsible for the dose differences
may also be related to the high concentrations of excitoxins used.
In the in vitro study, 200 ␮M glutamate was used to ensure the
induction of a massive neuronal death. Under this condition, a
relatively high dose of triol should be needed to reach its notable
neuroprotective effect. A similar phenomenon has been reported

Hu et al. • An Endogenous Triol Functions as Neuroprotectant

in studies of other endogenous neuroprotective agents in the
literature. For example, taurine, a well established endogenous
modulator, exerts its neuroprotection in rat primary cultured
neurons in a high concentration of 25 mM for antagonizing 250
␮M glutamate (Chen et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2005), whereas its
measured endogenous concentrations are ⬃2–9 mM in rat brain
(Porcellati, 1963; Palkovits et al., 1986). The main consideration
for using relatively high doses (8 mg/kg) of triol in in vivo experiments is aimed to obtain a maximal neuoroprotection effect
under the severe pathological condition of spinal cord ischemia,
because only one single dose was administrated to the animals. In
addition, triol binds with plasma proteins as high as ⬎90% of the
amount administrated, which may limit the concentrations of the
drug in the action sites. Conversely, it is notable that the concentrations of triol in spinal cord after exogenous administration
with 8 mg/kg of triol at multiple time points are comparable with
those induced by IPC. In both situations, triol displays definite
neuroprotections. However, we believe that the exact reasons for
the dose differences deserve additional investigation.
Intracellular calcium overload is generally accepted to be the
main mechanism underlying neuronal toxicity (Szydlowska and
Tymianski, 2010; Piccolini et al., 2013). Elevation of [Ca 2⫹]i may
activate Ca 2⫹-dependent proteases, break down critical proteins
or enzymes, and lead to neuronal death (Xiong et al., 2004).
Molecular neuroscience has further revealed that glutamate/
NMDA receptors consist of ligand-gated ion channels, by which
they control Ca 2⫹ influx (Evans et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013).
Glutamate-induced [Ca 2⫹]i elevation is mainly through NMDA
receptor channels (Murphy and Miller, 1988). In the current
study, we demonstrate that triol markedly attenuates glutamateinduced [Ca 2⫹]i increases in a concentration-dependent manner, which may account for the observed neuroprotective effects
of triol in both in vitro and in vivo models that implicate NMDA
receptor-mediated [Ca 2⫹]i overload. Furthermore, we observe a
significant use-dependent inhibition of NMDA current by triol
starting from 1 ␮M, which is a concentration equivalent to the
basal triol level (1.07 ␮M) in spinal cord in rats and an elevated
triol level (0.96 ␮M) at 4 h after IPC in rabbits.
The findings from radioactive triol binding assays demonstrate a specific binding site for triol in neurons. Furthermore, we
provide evidence of direct interplay between triol and NMDA
receptors with radioactive MK-801. MK-801 is widely used as a
use-dependent or open channel blocker for NMDA receptors.
When an NMDA receptor channel is in an open status (in use),
MK-801 enters into and binds at the inside of the channels, resulting in an inhibition (Huettner and Bean, 1988; RodríguezMoreno et al., 2011). The displacement of MK-801 binding by
triol suggests modulation on the open channel site in which MK801 binds, implying that triol may function as an endogenous
NMDA receptor open channel blocker, which is consistent with
the patch-clamp findings that triol use dependently inhibit
NMDA current. This observation was further supported by the
fact that the [ 3H]triol maximum binding with NMDA receptors
is significantly stimulated in the presence of 100 ␮m NMDA. The
recombinant NMDA receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells is a
more stringent molecular model and may provide a useful transgenic cellular model to clarify the effects of any potential modulators on NMDA receptors. It was reported that the functional
NMDA receptor is a heteromeric protein and requires coassembly of the NR1 (which binds glycine) subunit with at least one
NR2 (which binds glutamate) subunit (Paoletti and Neyton,
2007). Lines of evidence show the predominant extrasynaptic
NMDA subunit NR2B acts as a central mediator for stroke injury

Hu et al. • An Endogenous Triol Functions as Neuroprotectant

(Lai et al., 2011) and may represent a promising therapeutic target for stoke intervention. In our experiment, we investigate the
effects of triol on NMDA receptors with a focus on NR1/NR2B
subtype. These data further confirm the role of triol as a negative
modulator of NMDA receptors. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the selectivity of triol on other NMDA subunits in the future.
