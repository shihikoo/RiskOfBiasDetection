Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water channel expressed in astrocyte end-feet lining the blood–brain barrier.
AQP4 deletion in mice is associated with improved outcomes in global cerebral ischemia produced by
transient carotid artery occlusion, and focal cerebral ischemia produced by permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). Here, we investigated the consequences of 1-h transient MCAO produced by
intraluminal suture blockade followed by 23 h of reperfusion. In nine AQP4+/+ and nine AQP4−/− mice,
infarct volume was signiﬁcantly reduced by an average of 39 ± 4% at 24 h in AQP4−/− mice, cerebral
hemispheric edema was reduced by 23 ± 3%, and Evans Blue extravasation was reduced by 31 ± 2%
(mean ± SEM). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed greatest reduction in apparent diffusion coefﬁcient around the occlusion site after reperfusion, with remarkably lesser reduction
in AQP4−/− mice. The reduced infarct volume in AQP4−/− mice following transient MCAO supports the
potential utility of therapeutic AQP4 inhibition in stroke.

1. Introduction
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a bidirectional water transporting protein expressed in astrocytes throughout the central nervous system
[6,18]. AQP4 expression is greatest in the plasma membrane of
perivascular end-feet in astrocytes lining the blood–brain barrier
(BBB). AQP4 provides a major pathway for water entry into the
brain across an intact BBB in cytotoxic brain edema, as produced
by water intoxication [20]. AQP4 also appears to be involved in the
removal of excess water from the brain in vasogenic edema, as produced by brain tumors, though the mechanisms involved are not
clear because AQP4 functions as a water-selective transporter [19].

An early pathogenic event in ischemic brain injury is cytotoxic
brain swelling in which water from the vasculature enters the brain
across the BBB and accumulates in astrocytes [16]. Cytotoxic brain
swelling in ischemia is the consequence of cellular dysfunction
with consequent Na+ /K+ pump failure, creating an osmotic gradient
driving cellular water inﬂux [22]. Downstream effects of cerebral
edema and astrocyte swelling include increased extracellular space
glutamate and K+ concentrations, BBB breakdown and inﬂammation, resulting in neuronal loss [3,17]. AQP4 has been shown to be
the primary water transport pathway across the BBB [25] as well
as the astrocyte plasma membrane [23]. As such, its inhibition has
been proposed to be of potential therapeutic utility in cytotoxic
brain swelling [28].
Here, we tested the hypothesis AQP4 deletion in mice reduces
brain swelling and infarct volume in a model of ischemic stroke produced by transient (1-h) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
followed by 23-h reperfusion. We previously reported greatly
improved outcome in AQP4 knockout mice following focal ischemia

produced by permanent MCAO [16], and more recently, improved
outcome in AQP4 knockout mice following global ischemia produced by transient carotid artery occlusion [1,10]. Also, several
correlative studies reported reduced cerebral edema following
ischemia with reduced AQP4 expression, including propofol and
edaravone administration, protein kinase C activation [4], hypertonic saline administration [30], and endothelin-1 overexpression
[13]. Together, these results provide a robust body of evidence
supporting a neuroprotective effect of AQP4 down-regulation or
deletion in cerebral ischemia. However, one recent study reported
worse outcome in AQP4 deﬁciency in an ischemia-reperfusion
model [31], though the results are difﬁcult to interpret because the
mice used manifest marked baseline abnormalities including BBB
dysfunction [32], which are not seen in AQP4-deﬁcient mice used in
our studies [1,10,16,21] or those generated by the Haj-Yasein et al.
[7].

were determined by integrating the infarct area of different brain
slices areas with the use of cylinder and cone rules [24].
2.4. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
Imaging was done on a 7-T, 183-mm bore Oxford magnet
equipped with SMIS console and Magnex self-shielded gradients,
as described [12]. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were acquired
from a 1.4-mm thick slice approximately at the level of the bregma.
After surgical preparation and occlusion, mice were placed supine
in an acrylic carriage with the surface coil ﬁxed securely under
the head. The head was taped to the carriage to minimize motion
artifact. The time from the onset of occlusion and reperfusion to
the start of the ﬁrst image acquisition was less than 2 min. ADC
maps were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from each set of four
DWIs [15]. A color scale was used to delineate regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere with reduced ADC relative to the contralateral
hemisphere.

2.1. Transgenic mice

2.5. Evans Blue extravasation

AQP4 knockout (AQP4−/− ) mice were generated by targeted
gene disruption as described [14]. All experiments were performed
on weight-matched littermates (25–30 g) produced by intercrossing of heterozygous mice in a CD1 genetic background. Protocols
were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Animal Research.

A quantitative assay of Evans Blue was used, as described [11].
2.5 ml/kg of 4% Evans Blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.9% saline was
injected by tail vein. After one hour circulation, the mice were sacriﬁced and perfused transcardially with 200 ml of heparinized saline
(10 U/ml heparin in 0.9% of saline). The cerebral hemispheres were
separated and homogenized in 400 ␮l of N,N-dimethylformamide
(Sigma, MO) and then incubated for 72 h in a water bath at 55 ◦ C.
The samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 20 min. The extracted
Evans Blue dye in the supernatant was quantiﬁed by absorbance at
620 nm. Results were expressed as ␮g of Evans Blue per gram of
brain hemisphere by comparison with solution standards.

2.2. Transient focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion model
Adult male AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice were subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia by intraluminal middle cerebral
artery (MCA) blockage with a 5–0 monoﬁlament nylon suture, as
described [29]. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in 30%
oxygen/70% nitrous oxide using a facemask. Core body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C. Cannulation of the femoral
artery allowed for monitoring of mean arterial blood pressure and
arterial blood gases. A 9.5-mm 5–0 surgical monoﬁlament nylon
suture, blunted at the end, was introduced into the left internal
carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump, and the
left common carotid artery was temporarily occluded. After 1-h
MCA occlusion blood ﬂow was restored by the withdrawal of the
nylon suture and the mice were sacriﬁced after 23-h reperfusion.
Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was measured in anesthetized mice using a LASERFLO BPM2 blood perfusion monitor
equipped with a ﬂexible small-caliber probe of 0.7 mm diameter
(VASAMEDICS, St. Paul, MN) [29] which gently touch the skull (1mm anterior, 4 mm lateral to bregma), away from large pial vessels.
Laser Doppler Flowmetry values were averaged over 5-s intervals
and recorded before ischemia as a baseline, during occlusion, and
after reperfusion. Neurological deﬁcit was scored at 30 min after
MCA occlusion to verify successful occlusion. A score ≥ 2 indicated
successful occlusion [2].
2.3. Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume and cerebral edema
Brains were removed after 1-h occlusion and 23-h reperfusion,
and coronal brain slices were cut at 1, 3, 5, and 7 mm away from
the frontal pole by using a mouse Brain Matrix (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA). Brain slices were stained with 2% (weight/volume)
2,3,5-triphenyl- tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4)
at 37 ◦ C [24,29]. Infarct areas and hemispheric contours at each
level were outlined by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups using Image J software. Infarct volume and brain edema

3. Results
3.1. Physiological parameters
Physiological parameters of four AQP4+/+ and four AQP4−/− mice
undergoing MCAO are shown at Table 1. There are no signiﬁcant
differences among the groups in rectal temperature, MABP, PO2 ,
PCO2 , and pH, and no differences in each parameter before, during
and after MCA occlusion. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow was reduced
similarly by 93.5% and 92.4% in AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice during
occlusion, and was restored at 15 min after reperfusion to 44.9% and
47.1% of baseline values before occlusion. These results are typical
of reported MCAO studies in mice [9,29].
3.2. Reduced infarct volume and water content in AQP4−/− mice
MCA occlusion was carried out in nine AQP4+/+ and nine
AQP4−/− mice in which the MCA was occluded for 1 h and brains
were removed at 24 h (23 h after reperfusion) (Fig. 1A, top). Fig. 1A

(bottom) shows TTC staining of brain sections cut at 1, 3, 5, and
7 mm from the frontal pole. There was signiﬁcant reduction in
infarct area in the slice at 3 mm. Total infarct volume determined
from multiple slices in each mouse is summarized in Fig. 1B, with
data for each mouse shown separately. There was a signiﬁcant, 44%
reduction in total infarct volume from 39 ± 4 mm3 in AQP4+/+ mice
to 22 ± 4 mm3 in AQP4−/− mice. The enlargement of the ipsilateral,
ischemic hemisphere (resulting from brain swelling) was less in the
AQP4−/− mice, which attributed to 23% less water (Fig. 1C).
3.3. Changes in ADC
Representative ADC maps (Fig. 2A) show reduced ADC on
the ipsilateral (left) hemisphere corresponding to increased brain
water in the intracellular space and an increase in the size of
the intracellular compartment at the ischemic core and surrounding penumbra. The lesion area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
deﬁned as the area in which ADC decreased by more than 20% of
that in the contralateral hemisphere. As summarized in Fig. 2B,

X. Yao et al. / Neuroscience Letters 584 (2015) 368–372

in the ipsilateral hemisphere of mice undergoing MCAO, with signiﬁcantly reduced extravasation in the AQP4−/− mice. There was
little increase in Evans Blue dye in the contralateral hemisphere
compared with that in control mice that did not undergo MCAO.

4. Discussion

Fig. 2. ADC at indicated times during ischemia and reperfusion in AQP4+/+ and
AQP4−/− mice. A. ADC maps calculated from three adjacent, 2 mm-thick slices, covering the majority of the brain. Representative of maps obtained from four AQP4+/+
and four AQP4−/− mice. B. Relative ADC values were calculated by normalizing to
the contralateral hemisphere ADC values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, **P < 0.01.

reduced ADC was seen in the ﬁrst 15 min during occlusion and
remained elevated over 60 min of reperfusion in the AQP4+/+ mice.
Signiﬁcantly less reduction in ADC was seen in AQP4−/− mice during the reperfusion period. Baseline ADC values were 625 ± 42 vs.
640 ± 18 ␮ m2 /s in AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice, respectively (difference not signiﬁcant). These values are in agreement with previous
reported absolute ADC values in normal mouse brain [26,27].
3.4. Reduced Evans Blue extravasation in AQP4−/− mice
Blood–brain barrier permeability in AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice
was evaluated after 1-h occlusion and 23-h reperfusion by Evans
Blue dye extravasation. Fig. 3 shows increased dye extravasation

Fig. 3. Evans Blue extravasation in AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice at 23 h reperfusion
after 1 h MCA occlusion. Evans Blue dye was injected intraveneously 1 h before
sacriﬁce. Dye extravasation was quantiﬁed following dye extraction from brain
hemispheres after perfusion to remove intravascular dye (mean ± SEM, 4 mice per
group, **P < 0.01).

The principal ﬁnding of this study was signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct volume and brain swelling in AQP4-deﬁcient mice following
transient, 1-h focal cerebral ischemia produced by MCA occlusion,
following by 23-h reperfusion. These results extend our original
demonstration of improved outcome in AQP4-deﬁcient mice following focal ischemia produced by permanent MCA occlusion [16].
In that study there was signiﬁcantly improved neurological outcome at 24-h, with reduced infarct volume and brain swelling.
Our results also extend data obtained in a mouse model of secondary AQP4 insufﬁciency produced by ␣-syntrophin knockout,
where the knockout mice showed neuroprotection and reduced
brain swelling following 90-min MCA occlusion and 23-h reperfusion [2].
Recently, we showed signiﬁcant neuroprotection in AQP4deﬁcient mice in models of global cerebral ischemia produced by
transient bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) alone (‘2-vessel
occlusion’) [10], as well as transient BCAO done one day after bilateral vertebral artery cauterization (‘4-vessel occlusion’) [1]. In the
4-vessel occlusion model cerebral blood ﬂow during BCAO was
reduced by >94%, which models cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
In both the 2-vessel and 4-vessel BCAO models there was greatly
improved survival and neurological outcome in AQP4-deﬁcient
mice, supporting the conclusion that reduced water permeability of the blood–brain barrier and astrocyte plasma membrane in
AQP4-deﬁciency was responsible for reduced infarct volume and
improved outcome. Measurements of intracranial pressure following BCAO and studies in brain slices from AQP4-deﬁcient mice
exposed to anoxia supported a mechanism in which early cytotoxic brain edema and astrocyte swelling in response to cerebral
ischemia triggers a series of events including increased intracranial pressure, reduced extracellular space volume, BBB disruption,
oxidative injury and inﬂammation, leading to cytotoxicity and
infarction. We presume that similar neuroprotective mechanisms
apply to account for the beneﬁcial effects of AQP4 deletion in the
transient focal ischemia studies done here. Another possible contributing mechanism, which will require further investigation, is
that the endothelium in AQP4-deﬁcient mice is less susceptible to
ischemic injury than that in wild-type mice.
In addition to extending prior work, a motivation in carrying
out the study reported here was a conﬂicting report published
recently [31] in which mice were subjected to 5-min, 15-min or
40-min transient MCA occlusion followed by 24 or 72 h reperfusion. That study showed an increased mortality of up to 50%
in AQP4-deﬁcient mice during reperfusion. No mice died in the
MCAO study here or the study done in alpha-syntrophin knockout mice [2]. The conﬂicting data of Zeng et al. [31] are difﬁcult to
explain; as reviewed previously [20], a number of unusual phenotypes reported in AQP4-deﬁcient mice created by the Nanjing group
may be related to marked baseline abnormalities, including BBB
dysfunction [32] and sporadic hydrocephalus [5]. No differences
were found in our AQP4+/+ and AQP4−/− mice in baseline phenotype, cerebrovascular anatomy, blood–brain barrier integrity, and
brain histology [16,21].
DWI was used here as a secondary measure of cerebral edema,
as it is sensitive to early changes in brain tissue water distribution
during acute ischemia [12,26]. Hyperintensity on DWI is the result
of a reduction in the ADC of water. The mechanisms underlying the
ADC decrease following acute cerebral ischemia are thought to be

372

related to an increase in the fraction of intracellular vs. extracellular
water following anoxic depolarization due to Na-K-ATPase pump
failure, producing an increase in the tortuosity of the extracellular
space [8]. Reduced ADC reﬂects intracellular edema and regional
lesion severity [27]. The lesser reduction in ADC in AQP4-deﬁcient
mice compared to wild-type mice during reperfusion supports an
important role of early brain water accumulation of the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction in ischemia.
In conclusion, AQP4 deﬁciency remarkably reduced infarct volume and brain edema in an established mouse model of transient
focal cerebral ischemia produced by transient MCA occlusion followed by reperfusion. These results support prior studies showing
improve outcomes in AQP4-deﬁcient mouse models of focal cerebral ischemic produced by permanent MCA occlusion and global
cerebral ischemia produced by transient carotid artery occlusion.
Together, these results support the potential therapeutic utility of
AQP4 inhibition or down-regulation in ischemic stroke.
