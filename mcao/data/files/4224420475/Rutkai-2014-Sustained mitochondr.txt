ISCHEMIC STROKE is a leading cause of human morbidity and
mortality (34). Currently, thrombolytic or surgical therapies are
the only accepted treatments for occlusive stroke, but clot
removal is not prescribed for many patients because the time
window for administration is severely limited (14). Until recently, thrombolytic or surgical interventions were only medically endorsed if initiated within 3 h after the occurrence of a
stroke (18, 19). New studies, especially those from Europe,
have indicated that the therapeutic window of clot resolution
can be extended to 4.5 h or more after the onset of stroke, but
increasing cerebral vascular dysfunction and neurological damage may reduce beneficial results when initiated at a later time
(1, 11, 31, 39). Therefore, new therapies for these later time

periods are urgently needed for vulnerable stroke patients.
Recently, limited information from several sources has indicated that, contrary to currently held beliefs, significant mitochondrial function remains intact after ischemic stress, and
thus mitochondria may provide a novel, but yet unexploited,
therapeutic target (28, 38). However, no direct in vivo assessment of vascular mitochondrial function has yet been conducted in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic stress.
Previous studies have shown that selective activation of
mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K⫹ (mitoKATP) channels located
on the inner mitochondrial membrane by agents such as diazoxide (DZ) reduces brain infarct volume, preserves the
responsiveness of large cerebral arteries, and protects the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) when given before transient global
ischemia or transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
(tMCAO) (6, 12, 13, 26). In addition, activation of mitoKATP
channels protects the cultured endothelium, neurons, and astroglia against cell death after transient O2-glucose deprivation
(OGD) (4, 17, 20, 24, 32). Finally, recent studies have also
indicated that pharmacological activation of mitochondria after
tMCAO or OGD is as effective as pretreatment, thereby
suggesting that significant mitochondrial functionality is present even after severe anoxic/ischemic stress (5). One limitation
of in vivo studies is that the location of cellular protection
cannot be known with certainty since the neurovascular unit
represents many cell types, including neurons, astroglia, microglia, and vascular cells. Nonetheless, several recent studies
have demonstrated that the cerebral vasculature, especially the
endothelium, plays a critical role in determining neurological
outcome after stroke by maintaining appropriate blood flow
and the BBB (10, 15). However, no studies have directly
examined mitochondrial function in the cerebral vasculature
after tMCAO or other experimental models of stroke. Under
normal conditions, we and others have shown that mitochondria-dependent vasodilation of large cerebral arteries has both
endothelial and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) components
that contribute to the overall integrated vascular response (23,
42). Thus, increased nitric oxide (NO) production by the
endothelium augments the intrinsic relaxation of the VSM of
cerebral arteries after the application of DZ.
We hypothesized that mitochondrial function is maintained
after severe ischemic stress in cerebral arteries after tMCAO
and represents a previously unappreciated therapeutic target
that potentially can protect the cerebral vasculature and brain.
Specifically, we investigated 1) the effects of tMCAO on the
responses of isolated MCAs to mitochondrial activation as well
as to other general, nonmitochondrial-based vasoactive stimuli;
2) the relative contribution of the endothelium and VSM to the
integrated cerebral vascular response to mitochondrial activation after tMCAO; and 3) the effects of tMCAO on the
expression of mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins

Rutkai I, Katakam PV, Dutta S, Busija DW. Sustained mitochondrial functioning in cerebral arteries after transient ischemic
stress in the rat: a potential target for therapies. Am J Physiol Heart
Circ Physiol 307: H958 –H966, 2014. First published July 25, 2014;
doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00405.2014.—The objective of the present study
was to determine whether mitochondrial function in the cerebral
vasculature is maintained after transient middle cerebral artery (MCA)
occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 90
min of tMCAO followed by 4 or 48 h of reperfusion. MCAs from
ischemic (ipsilateral) and nonischemic (contralateral) sides were compared with control MCAs from sham-operated rats. We determined 1)
vasoreactivity to diazoxide (DZ; a mitochondrial ATP-activated K⫹
channel opener), ACh, bradykinin (BK), serotonin, and sodium nitroprusside; 2) levels of mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins
and mitochondrial DNA; and 3) vascular levels of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential).
All dilator responses, including those with DZ, were intact 4 h
post-tMCAO. Dilator responses to ACh, BK, and sodium nitroprusside were reduced in ipsilateral MCAs at 48 h compared with
contralateral MCAs, but DZ responses were comparable with control
MCAs. Surprisingly, contralateral responses to ACh, BK, and serotonin were reduced compared with control MCAs at 48 h. Ipsilateral
vasodilation to DZ at 48 h was eliminated by endothelial denudation
and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibition but was only
reduced in control MCAs. Mitochondrial proteins, phosphorylated
eNOS, mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial membrane potential
were higher in ipsilateral compared with contralateral MCAs. In
conclusion, contrary to conventional wisdom, mitochondria remain
functional for at least 48 h after severe ischemic stress in MCAs, and
DZ-induced dilation is preserved due to maintained mitochondrial
mass, probably in the endothelium, and eNOS signaling. Our findings
support the concept that functioning vascular mitochondria are an
unexpected target for novel stroke therapies.

and mitochondrial biogenesis in MCAs. We chose to use DZ
because of its selectivity to mitochondria, widespread use and
tolerance, proven effectiveness for the treatment of nonneurological diseases in people, and ability to cross the BBB (4, 6,
16, 37). We studied cerebral arteries 48 h after tMCAO, at a
time when the brain infarct is fully developed, but also examined the arterial responses at 4 h, when post-tMCAO hemodynamics had stabilized.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

length of anesthesia as the operated group with the midline neck
incision performed but without filament insertion (8).
Isolated pressurized artery technique. We have previously used
this method (23). Under 5% isoflurane (VetOne, Boise, ID)-induced
anesthesia, rats were decapitated, and brains were removed and
transferred to ice-cold 4°C oxygenated (20% O2-5% CO2-75% N2)
Ca2⫹-containing Krebs (Ca2⫹-Krebs) solution [composed of (in
mmol/l) 110 NaCl, 5.0 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.0 KH2PO4, 5.0
glucose, and 24.0 NaHCO3] at 7.4 pH. Microsurgery instruments
(Fine Science Tools) and a Nikon SMZ1000 operating microscope
were used for the isolation of MCAs in 4°C Ca2⫹-Krebs solution. An
isolated section of the MCA (⬍1 mm in length) was transferred into
a self-heated 37°C organ chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation,
St. Albans, VT) containing two glass micropipettes filled with Ca2⫹Krebs solution and cannulated on both ends. One of the micropipettes
was closed, and the other was connected with silicone tubing to a
pressure servo control system (Living Systems Instrumentation), and
the temperature was maintained at 37°C. Changes in arteriolar diameter were continuously measured and recorded by a video microscope
(Nikon Eclipse TS100, Sony CCD camera, VDA-10 Living Systems
Instrumentation Video Dimension Analyzer, LabView 2.0, and HP
computer). Spontaneous myogenic tone developed in response to 70
mmHg of intraluminal pressure during a 1-h equilibration period.
Endothelium-dependent responses of MCAs were tested using 10
␮mol/l ACh (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ␮mol/l bradykinin (BK; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and smooth muscle-dependent functions were
characterized using 10 ␮mol/l serotonin (5-HT; Sigma-Aldrich) and
10 ␮mol/l sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Sigma-Aldrich). After the
addition of each agent, the Ca2⫹-Krebs solution in the organ chamber
was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min.
Vascular responses to 10, 50, and 100 ␮mol/l DZ (Sigma-Aldrich)
were determined on intact and endothelium-denuded MCAs. Endothelial denudation was induced by injecting 1 ml of air through the
artery lumen. To investigate the different signal transduction pathways, DZ was applied in the absence and presence of the nonselective
NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N␻-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) at 100 ␮mol/l for 30 min (Sigma-Aldrich) and the
specific mitoKATP channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate at 1 mmol/l.
Western blot analysis. We performed Western blot analysis on
isolated MCAs (23, 40). Proteins were extracted by homogenizing
MCAs using a Radnoti glass tissue grinder in 4°C Nonidet P-40 lysis
buffer (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD) containing a proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor (both at 5 ␮l/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenate
was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used
for gel electrophoresis and Bradford protein assay to determine the
protein concentration of the sample. Proteins were separated by
4 –20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were
blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline and
1% Tween 20 (TBST; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature
and then washed three times with TBST. Membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies in 1% BSA-TBST
blocking solution for the following mitochondrial proteins: ATP
synthase, complex V subunit-␣ at 1:500 dilution (no. 459240, Invitrogen), total dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP-1) at 1:1,000 dilution
(no. 611112, BD Transduction, San Jose, CA) and its Ser616-phosphorylated form (pDRP-1) at 1:1,000 dilution (no. 3455, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and voltage-dependent anion channel
(VDAC) at 1:1,000 dilution (no. 4866, Cell Signaling Technology).
The same incubation conditions were applied for the following nonmitochondrial proteins: total endothelial NOS (eNOS) at 1:500 dilution (no. 610297, BD Transduction Laboratories) and its Ser1177phosphorylated form (peNOS) at 1:500 dilution (no. 9571, Cell
Signaling Technology) and the loading control ␤-actin at 1:5,000
dilution (no. A5441, Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were washed three
times and incubated with their respective horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary anti-goat-rabbit IgG at 1:5,000 dilution (Cell

Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 –10 wk old, n ⫽ 124) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed and cared for according to guidelines of and
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Tulane University in compliance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Animal care was provided by the
Department of Comparative Medicine. Rats were given soft food and
water ad libitum.
tMCAO. Rats were randomly assigned to two groups: a control
(sham-operated) group or an operated group, in which the cerebral
vasculature was exposed to tMCAO (36). Rats were subjected to a
modified Longa intraluminal filament method to induce ischemia by
the occlusion of one of the MCAs. We performed a 90-min period of
ischemia under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia consisting of 100 mg/ml
ketamine HCl (KetaVed, St. Joseph, MO) and 20 mg/ml AnaSed
xylazine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) followed by 48 h of
reperfusion without anesthesia. During surgery, supplemental O2 was
given, ointment was used to maintain eye lubrication, and a rectal
temperature probe and heating pad were used to monitor and maintain
body temperature at normal levels. Using an operating microscope for
visualization, a midline incision was made in the neck. The right
common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and internal carotid
artery were isolated from the surrounding tissue from the bifurcation
to the base of the skull. A 5-0 silk suture was used to ligate the
external carotid artery, and the lingual, maxillary, and occipital artery
branches were dissected and coagulated. Afterward, a 5-0 silk suture
was placed around the common carotid artery to prevent bleeding. To
occlude the MCA, a rubber-coated silicone monofilament (Doccol,
Sharon, MA), 3 cm in length and 0.35 or 0.37 mm in diameter, was
inserted through the small incision on the common carotid artery into
the internal carotid artery and into the circle of Willis, effectively
occluding the right MCA. A vascular clamp was used to fix the
filament in the vessel to prevent bleeding, and the incision was
covered with sterile 0.9% saline-soaked gauze. After 90 min of
ischemia, the intraluminal filament was removed, the incision was
closed using a wound clip (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA), and
rats were allowed to recover for 4 or 48 h with free access to soft food
and water. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was available for postoperative analgesia if needed. The tissue dehydrogenase marker 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
was used to visualize and document the volume of the infarcted brain
after the isolation of the MCAs. The reaction between TTC salt and
dehydrogenase enzyme resulted in red staining of viable tissue,
whereas the infarcted tissue resulted in a lack of staining due to the
absence of enzyme activity with which TTC could react. After
isolation of the MCAs, 2.0-mm-thick coronal sections were acquired
using a rat brain slicer matrix (Zivic, Pittsburgh, PA). Brain slices
were placed in a beaker containing a prewarmed (37°C) solution of
2% TTC dissolved in 0.9% saline, which was placed in a 37°C water
bath for 20 min. A scan was taken of the slices, and the infarct size
was determined using ImageJ Software (NIH). Infarct volumes were
established by averaging the infarcted area of the slices and were
expressed as a percentage of each hemispheric volume (%infarction).
In the control group, rats underwent a sham operation with the same

fluorescence was expressed as the percent decrease in control RFUs

RESULTS

Effectiveness of tMCAO. All animals used for the stroke
experiments had well-defined areas of infarcted tissue on the
ischemic side, ipsilateral to the tMCAO without obvious parenchymal damage on the nonischemic, contralateral side after
48 h. Specifically, tMCAO produced an infarction that covered
60.4 ⫾ 2.7% (n ⫽ 33, P ⬍ 0.05; data not shown) of the
ipsilateral hemisphere and involved both cortical and subcortical areas. Nonischemia (control) animals that received a sham

used to visualize the final reaction. The optical density of each band
was quantified and normalized to ␤-actin immunoband intensity using
ImageJ software (%intensity).
Mitochondrial DNA quantification. DNA was harvested by homogenizing isolated MCAs in 200 ␮l Nuclei Lysis solution using a DNA
extraction kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Levels of mitochondrial
(mt)DNA were measured using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
(MT-CYB, Rn03296746_s1), which was normalized to the nuclear
heat shock protein 70 gene (Hspa 1a, Rn00583013_s1, Applied
Biosystems) (40). Triplicates of the samples were run using the
following protocol: 1 cycle at 95°C for 15.05 min and 45 cycles at
95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Gene expression levels were
quantified using the ⌬⌬CT method (where CT is threshold cycle), and
mtDNA data were normalized to nuclear DNA and expressed as
means ⫾ SE.
Mitochondrial membrane potential. We investigated mitochondrial
membrane potential (⌬⌿m) using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
(TMRE) dye with excitation at 532 nm and emission at ⬎550 nm
(Invitrogen), which accumulates in active, negatively charged mitochondria via the strong electrochemical gradient, resulting in red
fluorescence (22). Arteries were loaded with 100 nmol/l TMRE for 30
min followed by a 15-min wash period and then treated with the
vehicle control (DMSO), 100 ␮mol/l DZ, or 500 nmol/l FCCP
(Sigma-Aldrich). FCCP is an ionophore uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, which eliminates ⌬⌿m and therefore diminishes mitochondrial TMRE staining. Images were acquired before and after
treatments using a Zeiss LSM 7 Live confocal microscope. ImageJ
software was used to analyze the recorded fluorescence Z-stack

Ischemia-reperfusion resulted in a decrease in TMRE staining compared with

increased compared with contralateral MCAs. DZ depolarized the mitochondria, producing a significant decrease in TMRE fluorescence, which had a

There are several new findings from this study. First, contrary to generally held expectations, we found that mitochondria-dependent cerebral arterial dilation to DZ was intact and
comparable with control values on the ipsilateral side after
tMCAO at both 4 and 48 h. Thus, despite a prolonged period
of ischemia, overall mitochondrial responses in cerebral arteries were preserved, whereas other nonmitochondrial dilator
responses, especially at 48 h, were severely impaired. Second,
the vascular endothelium appeared to play a dominant role in
the preserved mitochondria-derived vasodilation on the ipsilateral side at 48 h. Third, preserved MCA dilation to DZ at 48 h
on the ipsilateral side was associated with strong evidence of
maintained or increased mitochondrial mass as well as preserved mitochondrial depolarization to DZ, as shown by
TMRE measurements. An unexpected finding was that cerebral
vascular responsiveness in MCAs on the side opposite the
ischemia was substantially impaired at 48 h, indicating that the
cerebral vascular dysfunction extends beyond the ischemic
zone. We also found that contralateral MCAs showed decreased responsiveness to all of the agents examined at 48 h
compared with control arteries. Thus, even in cerebral arteries
distant from previously occluded arteries, vascular dysfunction
was present, thereby identifying the serious limitation of the
practice of only comparing ipsilateral and contralateral MCAs,
as in some stroke studies. These results clearly illustrate the
diversity of responses to ischemic stress that occur in different
segments of the cerebral vasculature and provide very strong
support for the concept that mitochondria, probably specific to
the endothelium, represent a novel therapeutic target for the

H964

retained or enhanced dilation to DZ after IR but also indicate
that its role is complex. For example, L-NAME administration
might inhibit both coupled and uncoupled eNOS, such that
both dilator (NO) and constrictor (superoxide anion) influences
from the endothelium may be altered. In ipsilateral MCAs at 4
h after tMCAO, there was a tendency for enhanced dilation to
DZ with L-NAME treatment, possibly implicating a role of
uncoupled eNOS during this time period. Nonetheless, an
increase in peNOS in ipsilateral MCAs provides further support for an augmented role of the endothelium in mediating
DZ-induced dilation after tMCAO and may also demonstrate
the basis for an amplification of mitochondria-initiated signaling. The endothelium is the most accessible component of the
cerebral circulation for the systemic administration of drugs
and other agents, such as stem cells, and thus is a potential
target for new stroke therapies (15, 41).
Supporting our vascular reactivity experiments with DZ, we
found evidence of maintained or increased mitochondrial mass
in ipsilateral arteries after tMCAO. First, the expression level
of highly conserved VDAC, one of the major proteins in
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, was increased in ipsilateral
MCAs compared with contralateral and control MCAs. VDAC
is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which provides transport pathways for respiratory chain substrates required for oxidative phosphorylation (21, 25, 33, 44). Our
results are supported by results from other studies (33, 44).
Furthermore, we found that protein levels of complex V
subunit-␣, located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, were
significantly increased after ischemia-reperfusion in ipsilateral
MCAs compared with control and contralateral MCAs. Complex V produces ATP from ADP via phosphorylation in the
presence of the respiratory chain’s electron transport-generated
proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (35).
These findings concerning VDAC and complex V subunit-␣
are in agreement with our previous findings on rat primary
cortical neurons after OGD (40). However, there were no
differences between protein levels in the contralateral and
control groups. One possible cause of the increased ATP
synthase expression may be a required amplified function to
restore oxidative phosphorylation, which is a time-dependent
mechanism. The increased levels of VDAC and complex V
support the concept that total mitochondrial mass is increased
after transient ischemia due to mitochondrial biogenesis. Corresponding with evidence of increased mitochondrial mass
were elevated levels of fission proteins DRP-1 and pDRP-1 in
ipsilateral MCAs (2, 40). Our second level of evidence of
maintained or increased mitochondrial mass in ipsilateral arteries after tMCAO is that mtDNA levels were higher in
ipsilateral compared with contralateral MCAs. Similarly, Yin
et al. (43) showed increased mtDNA and numbers of mitochondria in the brain 24 h after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
We have shown similar findings in cultured neurons after OGD
(40). Third, we observed a greater intensity of the mitochondria-specific TMRE fluorescence in ipsilateral compared with
contralateral MCAs. Evaluation of TMRE responses to DZ
indicated a greater decrease in the ipsilateral ⌬⌿m compared
with contralateral arteries, thereby providing information independent of vascular responsiveness that the mitochondria retained normal functionality. However, DZ caused a similar
decrease in ipsilateral and control ⌬⌿m, which reflects our
vascular data where DZ-induced vasodilation was similar in

treatment of stroke patients, especially when clot resolution is
delayed beyond the conventional 3 h.
Relatively large cerebral arteries, including MCAs, play an
important role in maintaining cerebral blood flow and contributing to changes in myogenic activity to diverse stimuli under
normal and pathological conditions (3, 30). We found that
under basal conditions, ipsilateral MCAs had a significantly
increased vascular diameter compared with contralateral and
control MCAs and a significantly impaired myogenic response
48 h after tMCAO to 70-mmHg intravascular pressure. At this
juncture, severe vascular dysfunction in the form of reduced
MCA responsiveness occurred to several dilator or constrictor
agents on the ipsilateral side. Our results are generally, but not
totally, in agreement with those of previous investigators who
showed variable effects on cerebral vascular responsiveness to
various stimuli at various times after tMCAO (7–9, 27, 29).
The variability of reported results is probably due to the use of
different techniques, species, and protocols. For example, we
show that despite the same duration of tMCAO, dilator and
constrictor responses of ipsilateral MCAs to all examined
stimuli were largely intact at 4 h but severely impaired at 48 h.
We appear to be among the first to show prominent impaired
vasodilator and vasoconstrictor responses of contralateral
MCAs that were never occluded compared with control MCAs
from normal rats. Our finding suggests that transient ischemic
stress produces endothelial and VSM dysfunction even in
cerebral arteries that are somewhat distant from occluded
arteries. During our review of the literature, we found only
limited reports of cerebral vascular dysfunction on the contralateral side after tMCAO since responses in other studies
were not normally compared with sham-operated, control arteries. The reasons for the relative vascular dysfunction on the
contralateral side are unclear at this time and deserve systematic investigation since similar effects may be present in
nonoccluded arteries in people suffering from a stroke and thus
may affect the extent of functional vascular and neuronal
recovery.
We elicited endothelium-dependent dilator responses using
ACh or BK, and the relaxation responses of MCAs to these
agents were greatly reduced 48 h after tMCAO on the ipsilateral side, as were endothelium-independent dilator and constrictor responses to SNP and 5-HT, respectively. Therefore,
we expected ipsilateral MCA responses to DZ to be similarly
impaired since dilation to this stimulus has previously been
found to be due to contributions from both the endothelium and
VSM (23). In addition, in an earlier report (22), we found that
dilation to DZ was impaired in another disease condition:
insulin resistance. Consistent with our previous studies in
normal animals, DZ was a potent vasodilator in control MCAs
and endothelium denudation and L-NAME treatment attenuated but did not block dilation of cerebral arteries to DZ (12,
23). DZ-induced dilation in ipsilateral MCAs was maintained
at similar levels as control arteries at not only 4 h but also 48
h after tMCAO, but not due to dual contributions from VSM
and the endothelium to DZ, as seen in control arteries and as
previously reported (16). Thus, the removal of endothelium
virtually eliminated MCA dilation to DZ at all doses examined.
Similarly, inhibition of endothelium-dependent dilator stimuli
by the administration of a NOS inhibitor caused a significant
decrease in the responses of MCAs to DZ. Taken together, the
data imply that the endothelium is the primary determinant of

ipsilateral and control MCAs. The greater amount of TMRE
staining in control MCAs than in ipsilateral MCAs may indicate that although mitochondrial proteins and perhaps mitochondrial numbers are augmented after tMCAO, all mitochondria, especially in VSM, might not be fully functioning. Nonetheless, increased biosynthesis of mitochondria, as demonstrated
by increased mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA as well as the
remodeling protein pDRP-1, together with enhanced levels of
activated eNOS, appears to be sufficient for the preservation of
MCA responses to DZ 48 h after tMCAO.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report preserved
mitochondria-derived vascular responses in the ischemic side
and diminished responses in the contralateral side in MCAs
after 90 min of ischemia and 4 and 48 h of reperfusion. Our
results support the concept that the endothelium exerts a
dominant compensatory role in maintaining mitochondrial
function after prolonged, transient cerebral ischemia. Although
the underlying mechanisms are not totally clear, these results
may contribute to a greater understanding of the ongoing
changes after ischemic stress as well as aid in the development
of potential therapies to help people suffering from strokes.
Thus, targeting mitochondria in the immediate postischemic
period may not only improve cerebral blood flow but may also
protect the neurovascular unit from further damage and cell
death and thereby decrease stroke-related morbidity and mortality. In addition, our finding that both previously occluded as
well as nonoccluded arteries were affected differently by tMCAO
indicates that distinct therapeutic approaches are needed to preserve cerebral vascular function after strokes.
