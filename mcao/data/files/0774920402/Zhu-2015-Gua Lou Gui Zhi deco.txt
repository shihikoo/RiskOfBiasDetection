Abstract. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective and antispastic
effects of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) in a rat model
of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The MCAO rats
were treated with GLGZD (14.3 g/kg body weight) once a day
for a period of seven days. Neurological deficit scores and
screen tests were analyzed every other day. Following treatment
with GLGZD for 7 days, the ischemic infarct volume of the rat
brains was measured using 2,3,5‑triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction
was performed in order to determine the mRNA expression
levels of γ‑amino butyric acid B (γ‑GABA B) receptor (R) in
the cortical infarct region. Furthermore, the protein expression
levels of GABAB R were detected in the cortical infarct region
by western blot analysis. Following 7 days, treatment with
GLGZD significantly ameliorated the neurological defects and
cerebral infarction in the MCAO rats. In addition, treatment
with GLGZD ameliorated motor performance in the MCAO
rats, as determined by screen tests. Furthermore, GLGZD was
able to upregulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of
GABAB1 R and GABAB2 R in the ischemic cerebral cortex. The
results of the present study suggested that GLGZD may exert
neuroprotective and antispastic effects in a cerebral ischemia
model, through upregulating the expression of GABAB R.

symptoms of stroke is spasticity, which usually occurs within
the first few days or weeks (2). The presence of spasticity one
year after stroke has been reported in ≤38% of patients (3,4).
Spasticity is associated with pain, ankylosis, tendon retraction and muscle weakness in patients, all of which may limit
rehabilitation (5,6). Furthermore, spasticity interferes with the
functional recovery of patients, and may eventually negatively
affect the quality of life of stroke survivors (7). Therefore,
it is essential to identify effective therapeutic approaches to
treat spasticity, and to explore the mechanisms underlying
spasticity, which are currently not well understood.
The possible pathogenesis of stroke‑induced spasticity
may be due to an excess of excitatory neurotransmitters, and
a shortage of inhibitory neurotransmitters (8‑10). This imbalance may be mediated by the excitatory neurotransmitter
metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ‑amino butyric acid B (γ‑GABA B)
receptor (R) (11). The GABAB R is composed of two subunits:
B1 and B2 (GABAB1 and GABAB2) (12), which have an important role in post‑stroke spasticity (13). It has previously been
shown that GABAB R expression is reduced in the brain stems
of rats with post‑stroke spasticity (8), thus indicating that the
GABA B R is closely associated with stroke‑induced spasticity. Furthermore, activation of GABA B R with baclofen, a
GABA agonist, is able to effectively inhibit the muscle stretch
reflex (14), suggesting that either restoring or preserving normal
GABA B R expression levels may be a potential approach to
counteract stroke‑induced spasticity. It has been hypothesized
that various types of intervention, which are able to increase
the expression of GABA B R, may relieve the symptoms of
post‑stroke spasticity.
Numerous pharmacological agents have been used to
treat post‑stroke spasticity, including baclofen, benzodiazepines and botulinum toxin (15‑16). However, a number of
these therapeutic drugs exhibit considerable side effects,
including muscle weakness, hepatotoxicity, drowsiness
and ataxia (15,17,18). Therefore, there has recently been
an increased focus on the use of natural products, such as
traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), which have relatively low toxicity and fewer side effects, as compared with
modern therapeutics. The classic TCM formula Gua Lou
Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) was initially documented in
‘Jin Gui Yao Lue’, by Zhongjing Zhang during the Eastern

Han Dynasty (~25‑220 AD). GLGZD consists of six herbs:
Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim, Paeonia  lactiﬂora Pall,
Cinnamomum cassia Presl, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch,
Zingiber  ofﬁcinale Rosc and Ziziphus jujuba Mill. As
a well‑known TCM compound, it has long been used to
treat stroke‑induced spasticity, epilepsy and spinal cord
injury (19‑21). The results of previous clinical experiments
have demonstrated that GLGZD exerts a significant therapeutic effect on post‑stroke disabilities, including muscular
spasticity, by improving Fugl‑Meyer and Barthel index
scores (22). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the
therapeutic effects of GLGZD remain largely unknown. In
our previous study, GLGZD was shown to exert neuroprotective and antispastic effects in a cerebral ischemia model,
via modulation of glutamate levels, and AMPA and NMDA
glutamate receptors (23,24). The GABA B R controls neuronal
excitability and glutamate receptor activity, which are associated with post‑stroke spasms (25‑27). The present study used
a focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury rat model,
which resembles human ischemic stroke, to evaluate the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of GLGZD against spasticity following
cerebral ischemia. In addition, the underlying molecular
mechanisms were investigated, which were hypothesized to
be associated with the GABA B R.
Materials and methods
Reagents. Rabbit anti‑rat polyclonal anti‑GABA B1  R
(cat. no. 3835; dilution, 1:1,000), rabbit anti‑rat polyclonal
anti‑GABAB2 R (cat. no. 3839; dilution, 1:1,000), rabbit anti‑rat
polyclonal anti‑β‑actin (cat. no. 4967; dilution, 1:1,000), and
goat anti‑rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‑conjugated
secondary antibodies (cat. no. 7074; dilution, 1:1,000) were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly,
MA, USA). All other chemicals used in the present study,
unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma‑Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).
Preparation of water extract of GLGZD. GLGZD consists of
six drugs: Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim, Paeonia lactiﬂora
Pall, Cinnamomum cassia Presl, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch,
Zingiber ofﬁcinale Rosc and Ziziphus jujuba Mill, in a weight
ratio of 10:3:3:2:3:3. Dried crude drugs were purchased from
Guo Yi Tang Chinese Herbal Medicine store (Fujian, China),
and the drug mixture was soaked in double distilled water
for 30 min. Subsequently, the mixture was decocted twice
by boiling (1 h each time). The filtered solution from the two
decoctions was then concentrated using a rotary evaporator
(Model RE‑2000; Yarong Biochemistry Instrument Factory,
Shanghai, China), in order to obtain a final concentration of
1.06 g/ml. The GLGZD was subsequently stored for further
analysis.
Animals. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats (n=27; initial body
weight, 240‑280 g) were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center (Shanghai, China), and housed in a temperature‑ and humidity‑controlled room. The rats underwent a
12 h light/dark cycle and were provided access to food and
water ad libitum. All animal treatments and experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee

of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Fuzhou,
China).
Focal cerebral I/R model and experimental groups. The
cerebral I/R model was established following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), as described previously (28).
Briefly, prior to surgery the rats were fasted for 24 h; during
this time the rats were still provided ad libitum access to
water. Following anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate by
intraperitoneal injection (300 mg/kg), the left common carotid
artery, left external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid
artery (ICA) were exposed and isolated by a midline neck incision. Nylon surgical thread (18‑22 mm) was inserted into the
left ICA until the blunted distal end met resistance, in order to
block the middle cerebral artery (MCA). A total of 2 h after
occlusion, reperfusion was achieved by removing the thread
to restore blood supply to the MCA. The rectal temperature
of the rats was maintained at 37˚C throughout the surgical
procedure.
The rats were randomly divided into the following three
groups: i) Sham‑operated control (SC) group (n=9), which
underwent neck dissection and the exposure of ICA and ECA,
without MCAO; ii) ischemia control (IC) group (n=9), which
underwent MCAO surgery followed by reperfusion 2 h after
occlusion; and iii) GLGZD group (n=9), which underwent
MCAO surgery followed by reperfusion 2 h after occlusion,
and received GLGZD (14.3 g/kg body weight) by intragastric
administration once a day for a period of 7 days, as soon as the
rats had recovered from reperfusion.
Scoring of neurological defects. A total of 2 h after induction
of cerebral ischemia, and for the following 7 days, neurological defects of the rats were scored every other day. The
neurological defects were scored by two researchers, who were
blinded to the treatment conditions, according to a standard
scoring system on a four‑point scale (28): Score 0, no neurological defect; score 1, unable to fully extend the right forepaw;
score 2, circling to the right; score 3, falling to the right; and
score 4, loss of walking ability. The rats that scored between 1
and 3 points were considered to be successful models.
Screen tests. In order to measure the muscle tone, strength,
stamina and balance of the rats subjected to cerebral ischemia,
screen tests were performed 2 h after induction of cerebral
ischemia and for the following 7 days, using a net screen
(Dashitong Equipment Co., Ltd., Fuzhou, China). The screen
tests were conducted as described previously (29). The scoring
criteria were as follows: 5, Holding onto the screen and
climbing upward; 4, holding onto the screen with forelimbs
and not falling down within 5 sec; 3, holding onto the screen
temporarily and slipping off a certain distance; 2, falling to the
ground within 5 sec; 1, falling to the ground immediately, as
soon as the screen was set at a vertical position.
Measurement of infarct volume. A total of 7 days after
induction of cerebral ischemia, the rats were sacrificed
with 10% chloral hydrate, and perfused transcardially with
0.9% NaCl. The brain of each rat was harvested and dissected
into six coronal blocks (2 mm/slice). The fresh slices were
incubated in 2% (w/v) 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride

solution in phosphate‑buffered saline for 20 min at 37˚C in
the dark. Normal areas of the brain were stained dark red
based on intact mitochondrial function, whereas the infarct
areas remained unstained. Images of the stained slices were
captured using a high‑resolution digital camera (Canon Sx20;
Canon, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The Motic Med 6.0 Digital Medical
Image Analysis system (Motic Microscopes, Xiamen, China)
was used to quantify the infarct volume by integration of the
areas from the sections.
Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR).
Total RNA was extracted from the cortical infarct region of
the rats using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Puriﬁed RNA (3 µg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using the RevertAidTM H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis
kit (Fermentas, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
obtained cDNA was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of GABA B1 R and GABA B2 R by PCR using Taq
DNA polymerase (Fermentas); β‑actin served as an internal
control. An S1000 PCR thermal cycler (Bio-rad Laboratories,
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) was used and the PCR conditions
were as follows: 94˚C for 3 min, denaturation for 30 sec at
94˚C (35 cycles), annealing for 30 sec at 58˚C, polymerization
for 45 sec at 72˚C and finally extension for 10 min at 72˚C.
The primers and the annealing temperatures (˚C) used for the
amplification were as follows: Sense, 5'‑CGG GTG GTA TGC

by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (Biowest, Hong Kong,
China). The DNA bands were then examined using a Gel
Documentation system (Gel Doc 2000; Bio‑Rad Laboratories,
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
Western blot analysis. The cortical infarct region of the rats was
homogenized in non‑denaturing lysis buffer (EMD Millipore,
Boston, MA, USA) and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min.
The protein concentration in the supernatants was then determined. Protein lysates were separated by 10% SDS‑PAGE and
then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China). The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% non‑fat
dry milk, and were then incubated with primary antibodies
targeting GABAB1 R, GABAB2 R and β‑actin (1:1,000 dilution)
overnight at 4˚C. The membranes were then incubated with
appropriate HRP‑conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h.
The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence,
and images were captured using a Bio‑Image Analysis system
(Bio‑Rad Laboratories, Inc.).
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the means of ≥3
determinations. Statistical analysis of the data was performed
with Student's t‑test and one‑way analysis of variance using the

GLGZD ameliorates neurological defects and cerebral
infarction. The neuroprotective effects of GLGZD were examined by evaluating the neurological defect scores and cerebral
infarct volume of the rats. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the rats in
the IC and GLGZD groups exhibited marked signs of cerebral
infarction and neurological defects, whereas the rats in the
SC group did not show any manifestation of cerebral injury.
However, following treatment with GLGZD for 7 days, the
cerebral infarct volumes were significantly reduced (Fig. 1A
and B), and the neurological defect scores were improved
(Fig. 1C). These results indicate that GLGZD may have therapeutic efficacy against cerebral I/R injury.
GLGZD improves motor performance. To determine the motor
function of the rats subjected to cerebral I/R, screen tests were
performed on the rats from all of the experimental groups.
As shown in Fig. 2, the screen test scores of the IC rats were
significantly decreased, as compared with the rats in the SC
group. However, disordered motor function was significantly
ameliorated following treatment with GLGZD between days
5 and 7. These results indicate that treatment with GLGZD
may ameliorate cerebral I/R‑induced spasticity in rats.

MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 12: 5957-5962, 2015

GLGZD increases the expression levels of GABA B R subunits
following cerebral I/R. To further explore the mechanisms
underlying the GLGZD‑induced amelioration of post‑cerebral
I/R spasm, RT‑PCR and western blot analysis were performed
to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of GABAB R
subunits in the ischemic cortex, respectively. The mRNA and
protein expression levels of the GABA B1 R and GABA B2 R
were decreased in the IC group, as compared with the SC
group. However, following treatment with GLGZD for 7 days,
the expression levels of the GABA B1 R and GABA B2 R were
increased (Fig. 3 and 4). These data suggest that treatment with
GLGZD may promote the activation of the GABAB R in the
ischemic cortex.
Discussion
Post‑stroke spasticity is one of the most physically debilitating
conditions in aged populations, due to muscle hyperactivity,
which results in limb stiffness and muscle spasm (30). It has
been hypothesized that post‑stroke spasticity is induced by an
imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, which may be mediated by the expression of mGlu R1
and GABA B R. This imbalance may induce the abnormal
transmission of sensory information and motion instruction,
and subsequently increase the muscle activity and the active
tonic stretch reflex (31). Direct evidence regarding the involvement of the GABA B R in post‑stroke spasticity has yet to be
reported; however, numerous lines of research have suggested
that the GABAB R may affect the clinical signs of spasticity,
and participate in an experimental animal model of cerebral
ischemia‑induced limb spasms (8,32). A previous clinical study
demonstrated that baclofen, a GABA agonist, was able to cross
the blood‑brain barrier and bind to the GABAB R at the presynaptic terminal, suggesting that it may be used for the treatment
of spasticity (14). In addition, catgut implantation at acupoints
has been shown to relieve limb spasticity in the brain stem
of rats after stroke via upregulation of the GABA B R expression (8). These studies suggest that the GABAB R may have an
important role in the mechanisms underlying post‑stroke spasticity. The GABA B R is a heterodimeric G‑protein‑coupled
receptor, which is composed of two subunits: GABAB1 R and
GABAB2 R. The GABAB R is abundantly expressed post‑ and
presynaptically throughout the central nervous system in
virtually all types of neurons (33). It mediates slow inhibitory neurotransmission, and/or hyperpolarizes the neuronal
membrane, thereby controlling the excitability of neurons and
consequently participating in post‑stroke spasticity (34‑36).
GLGZD is a classical TCM formula that has previously
been used to treat post‑stroke spasticity. Recent clinical trials
have demonstrated that GLGZD had a significant therapeutic effect on limb spasm in patients following cerebral
stroke (21,22). However, the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective and antispastic effects remain largely unknown.
The present study aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms
of GLGZD, using a focal cerebral ischemia rat model. The
results of the present study demonstrated that treatment
with GLGZD exerted neuroprotective effects by improving
neurological defects and reducing cerebral infarct volume. In
addition, GLGZD was shown to improve motor performance,
as determined using a screen test. Furthermore, as expected,

5961

GLGZD was able to signiﬁcantly upregulate the mRNA and
protein expression levels of both GABAB1 R and GABAB2 R in
the cerebral ischemic cortex.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that treatment with GLGZD exerts neuroprotective effects and improves
spasticity in an ischemic stroke model via upregulation of the
GABA B R. These findings suggest that GLGZD may be a
potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia and spasticity.
