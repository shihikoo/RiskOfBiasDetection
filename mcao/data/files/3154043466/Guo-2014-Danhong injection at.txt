Abstract Danhong injection, a Chinese Materia Medica
standardized product extracted from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and Flos Carthami tinctorii, is used extensively
for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases such as acutely
cerebral infarction in clinic. In this study, we further
investigated the mechanisms of Danhong injection on
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage relating to Nrf2/
ARE signalling pathway in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo
experiment, cerebral I/R injury was induced through middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Rats were randomly divided into
five groups: sham-operated group, I/R injury group, 6 mg/
kg edaravone injection (positive control drug) group,
0.9 ml/kg Danhong injection (DHI-L) group, 1.8 ml/kg
Danhong injection (DHI-H) group. The neurological score,
cerebral infarction and brain edema were assessed while
levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH)
and malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissue were also
evaluated. Transcription levels of nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. For in vitro
experiment, mouse Neuro-2A cells were wounded with
H2O2 then cell viability and mRNA transcriptions levels of
Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 were detected. Protein expression level
of Nrf2 was assayed by western blotting. The results showed
that Danhong injection could ameliorate neurological score,
cerebral infarction and brain edema. Also it can increase

levels of SOD, GSH and decrease of MDA and upregulate
expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 in ischemic brain tissue
in vivo. What’s more, it increased the mRNA transcription
of Nrf2 and HO-1 and upregulated protein expression of
Nrf2 in vitro. These findings suggested that Danhong
injection could prevent I/R-induced brain damage through
activating Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most
frequent cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide.
The pathophysiological processes in stroke are extensively
diverse and dependent on the severity, duration and
localization of ischemic damage in the brain. Oxidative
stress which lead to ischemic cell death involves the formation of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species
(ROS/RNS) through multiple injury mechanisms, such as
mitochondrial inhibition, Ca2? overload and inflammation
[1, 2]. The close relationship between oxidative stress and
cerebral ischemia has generated considerable interest in
developing antioxidant therapies to combat ischemiainduced damage [3].
Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), a
basic leucine-zipper transcription factor that binds antioxidant response elements (AREs), plays an important role in
preventing development of oxidative stress through
upregulation of the Nrf2-related antioxidants [4]. Under
homeostatic conditions, the synthetic Nrf2 is captured by
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and constitutively degraded via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in

123

1818

cytoplasm [5]. Under oxidant conditions, Nrf2 dissociates
from Keap1 to escapes Keap1-dependent degradation [6].
Released Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, and upregulates
transcription of phase II genes, such as heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1),
glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), glutamate-cysteine
ligase and glutathione peroxidases, etc. [7].
Danhong injection, a Chinese Materia Medica standardized product extracted from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and
Flos Carthami tinctorii, is used extensively for the treatment
of cerebrovascular diseases such as acutely cerebral infarction in clinic. Our colleague Liu et al. [8] have fully studied
the main compositions and contents of this preparation. It
contains danshensu, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B
(SalB), salvianolic acid C, rosmarinic acid, protocatechuic
acid and some saccharides. These compositions are the
material basis of neuroprotective effect of Danhong injection. Chen et al. [9] showed that Sal B significantly reduced
lipid peroxides, scavenged free radicals and improved the
energy metabolism in ischemia–reperfusion induced injury
rat brain. Jiang et al. [10] demonstrated that Sal A could
inhibit granulocyte adherence by decreasing ICAM-1
expression in brain micro-vascular endothelial cells
(BMEC). Luan et al. [11] reported that rosmarinic acid could
attenuate histopathological damage, decrease brain edema,
inhibit NF-jB activation and reduce high-mobility group
box1 (HMGB1) expression in ischemic diabetic stroke rats.
Recently, He et al. [12] demonstrated that Danhong
injection possesses a strong ameliorative effect on cerebral
I/R damage in rats. However, the detailed mechanism has
still not yet been completely resolved. Therefore, we further examined the mechanism of Danhong injection in
MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and H2O2induced oxidative stress.

Materials and Methods
MCAO-Induced Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats
Protocols involving the use of animals complied with the
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee at Tianjin
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Male Wistar rats
(250–280 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg). Body temperature was
monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C during the surgery. The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded as
described in our previous report [13]. Briefly, after the midline
of ventral cervical skin incision, the left common carotid,
external carotid and internal carotid were exposed. A nylon
monofilament (diameter 0.34 mm) coated with polylysine
was introduced into internal carotid artery through the common carotid artery to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1817–1824

artery. After 1 h of ischemia, the monofilament was removed.
The laser Doppler equipment was used to monitor the cerebral
blood flow during the operation process. The success criteria
of model was that rat local cortical blood flow decreased to
15 ± 5 % of baseline when inserted filament and could
quickly restore when reperfusion. In sham-operated rats, the
left carotid artery was exposed without introducing the filament into the internal carotid artery.
Drug Administration
Danhong injection was provided by Shanxi Buchang
Pharmaceutic Co. (Xian, Shanxi, China). We converted a
commonly used dosage of Danhong injection in clinical
practice as the chosen dose (0.9, 1.8 ml/kg) in our study.
Animals were randomly divided into five groups: (1) shamoperated group; (2) vehicle-treated group; (3) 6 mg/kg edaravone injection (positive control drug) group; (4)
0.9 ml/kg Danhong injection (DHI-L) group; (5) 1.8 ml/kg
Danhong injection (DHI-H) group. Rats were intraperitoneally administered with Danhong injection or edaravone
injection 30 min before ischemia, with reperfusion and 24,
48, 72 h after ischemia. In the case of the sham-operated
and vehicle-treated group, equal volume solvent was
administered in the same manner.
Neurological Score, Brain Infarct and Edema Volume
Seventy-two hours after reperfusion, the neurological score
was recorded by an examiner who used the method that
was described previously [26] as following scale system:
(1) reflex with folding of contralateral paw over chest; (2)
weakened grip to cage top; (3) circles to the right or left
when placed on floor; (4) moves only when stimulated; and
(5) dead. The rats were then sacrificed when brains were
quickly removed and coronal slices were cut at 2 mm from
the frontal tips. Slices were stained with 2 % 2,3,5-tripenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma Chemical Co, USA)
at 37 °C for 10 min. The infarct area in each slice was
photographed and evaluated using the ImageJ program.
Infarct volume of each slice was obtained by multiplying
the infarct area by 2 mm thickness. Total infarct volume
was determined by summing up infarct volume of six
consecutive slices. In parallel with infarct volume, brain
edema was determined using the wet/dry method as previously described [25], in which percentage brain
water = [(wet weight-dry weight)/wet weight] 9 100 %.
Monitor of SOD, MDA and GSH Levels
To determine SOD, MDA and GSH levels, the ischemic brain
tissues were collected at 72 h after reperfusion. A 10 % (w/v)
homogenate was prepared in ice-cold saline. The

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1817–1824

homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000g for 15 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant was used for bioassays as the methods provided by the assay kits (Jiancheng, China). The assay results
were normalized by protein concentration in each sample.
The activity of SOD was determined using a xanthine/
xanthine oxidase system for production of superoxide radical.
Adding chromophore, which could be reducted to a watersoluble yellow dye through the above system. Then the SOD
activity was determined through suppressing the reduction of
chromophore. Optical density was determined by spectrometer at 550 nm. The content of MDA was measured with a
thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. MDA could react with TBA to
formation the red adduct (MDA-TBA). MDA-TBA has a
maximum absorption at 532 nm, thus can be detected by a
colorimetric method. The level of GSH was determined using
5,5-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as the colour reagent. The
optical density was spectrophotometrically recorded at
420 nm.

Cell Culture and Viability Assay
Mouse Neuro-2A cells were routinely grown in Modified
Eagle’s Medium (MEM, Hyclone, USA), supplemented
with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA), penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/l) in a humidified
atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C.
To examine the toxic effects of Danhong injection alone
on Neuro-2A cell. Cells were cultured in a 96-well plate
and incubated with various concentrations (0.625–40 ll/
ml) of Danhong injection for 24 h in a serum-free medium.
To examine the cytoprotective activity of Danhong injection, Neuro-2A cells were co-treated with Danhong injection and 50 lM H2O2 (Sigma, USA) for 24 h. Then culture
medium was removed and 10 % CCK-8 (Dojindo, Japan)
was added each well. Cells were then incubated for 30 min
at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a
microplate reader (Spectra III, TECAN, Switzerland).

Danhong Injection Reduced the Neurological Score,
Brain Infarct and Edema Volume
We observed infarct size using vital staining with 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Normal brain tissue
was stained deep red, whereas the infarct tissue was not
stained. At 72 h after reperfusion, compared to vehicletreated group, DHI-L, DHI-H and edaravone groups significantly reduced in infarct volume. Similarly, neurological score was also significantly reduced in DHI-L, DHI-H
and edaravone groups. In DHI-H and edaravone groups, the

(58.03 ± 5.04 %). But no statistical significance was
observed in DHI-L group (Fig. 1).

and Neuro-2A Cell

Antioxidant Effects of Danhong Injection
MCAO-induced antioxidant enzymes changes were shown
in Fig. 2. At 72 h after reperfusion, SOD and GSH levels
were much lower than those in the sham group while MDA
level was higher. Treatments with DHI-L, DHI-H and edaravone increased SOD and GSH levels, decreased MDA
level compared with the vehicle group, which implied that
Danhong injection significantly suppressed oxidative stress
in ischemic brain.
Effects of Danhong Injection on Cell Viability
The cell toxicities of Danhong injection (0.625–40 ll/ml)
were assessed by CCK-8 assay. Concentrations of[5 ll/ml
had toxic effects on Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3a). Cell viability
finding confirmed that Danhong injection (5 ll/ml) could
effectively increase cell viability (Fig. 3b). As a result,
5 ll/ml was used in subsequent experiments.

123

Real time RT-PCR was performed to determine the relative
levels of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 mRNA transcriptions in rat
brain tissue and Neuro-2A cell. As shown in Fig. 4, the
results showed weak Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 positive signals
in the brain tissues in sham group. In contrast, significant
increase of the Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 mRNA trasncripitons
were found in vehicle group. Meanwhile, compared with the
vehicle group, the signals were strengthened in DHI-H and
edaravone groups. We found similar changes in the analysis
of the Nrf2 and HO-1 genes expression in vitro, but not of
NQO1 (Fig. 5). It implies that Danhong injection ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain damage through
regulating the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

cell induced by H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6, western blotting
analysis showed weak Nrf2 signals in Neuro-2A cell in
control group. By contrast, significant increase of the Nrf2
protein expression was found in H2O2 group. Compared
with the H2O2 group, the signal was strengthened in the
5 ll/ml Danhong injection group.

Discussions
Danhong injection is extracted from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae and Flos Carthami tinctorii. It is widely used in
traditional Chinese preparation to treat cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases [12, 14]. Experiments showed that
Danhong injection could inhibit ox-LDL-induced maturation of the dendritic cells partly through activating PPARcmediated signaling pathway [15]. It also protect against
myocardial reperfusion injury in minipigs, reduce

1821

infiltration of inflammatory cells, maintain mitochondrial
integrity and increase SOD levels [16]. Edavarone was
selected as a positive drug in our study, which was widely
used in clinical to treat acute ischemic stroke [27]. In this
study, we proved that Danhong injection reduced the
neurological score, brain infarct and edema volume. It also
significantly increased SOD and GSH levels, decreased
MDA level in MCAO rats. Meanwhile, Danhong injection
(5 ll/ml) markedly increased survival rate of cells exposed
to H2O2. Our results are consistent with previous study.
Cerebral infarction is often accompanied by edema. Our
results showed that DHI-H could simultaneously improve
infarction and edema. However, DHI-L significantly
reduced cerebral infarct volume but is less effective to
edema. We hypothesize that at early time points after
cerebral ischemia edema could be induced, with the subsequent neuronal apoptosis and necrosis during the further
development of cerebral edema. High dose of Danhong
injection might directly act on the brain infarct and edema
volume, and low dose could not inhibit of edema directly,
but it may delay the further development of edema,
resulting in a positive effect on reducing the cerebral
infarct volume.
Nrf2/ARE pathway plays a key role in orchestrating
cellular antioxidant defenses and maintaining redox
homeostasis by mediating induction of a variety of antioxidant defense enzymes [17–19]. HO-1 belongs to a
family of cytoprotective and detoxification genes that
possess AREs in their regulatory regions. HO-1 can exert
potent indirect anti-oxidative function by catabolizing
heme to biliverdin, iron and carbon monoxide [20]. NQO1,
one of the other Nrf2-target genes, whose increasing
expression has been reported in both ischemia and seizure
models [21]. Lots of evidence has demonstrated the protective role of Nrf2-regulated gene products in central
nervous system diseases.
While several previous studies have shown that activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway can protect neural cells
against various oxidative stress-induced damage [22, 23], it
remains unclear whether Danhong injection can effectively
protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress-induced
toxicity. In the present study, we demonstrated that Danhong injection effectively inhibits oxidative stress induced
nerve damage and this protective effect was associated
with Nrf2 levels in the brain after I/R. And further study
will be carried out to obtain more direct evidence on the
causative role of Nrf2 activation in attenuating lesion
volume by Danhong injection. For example, an earlier time
point (before infarct is maximal) or combined Danhong
with Nrf2 inhibitor experiment.
Previously, Danhong injection has been shown to activate the Nrf2 expression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
subjected to ischemia/reperfusion [24]. However, whether

Danhong injection activate Nrf2/ARE pathway in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion model has not been evaluated. To
certify this possibility, we examined the effects of Danhong
injection on Nrf2 levels as well as its downstream targets in
MCAO-induced brain damage in vivo and H2O2-induced
toxicity in vitro. Our data showed, for the first time, that
Danhong injection could increase Nrf2 levels in neuronal
cells and increase in the expressions of HO-1 and NQO1,
whose genes are known to be upregulated by Nrf2 activation. Our data showed that 1.8 ml/kg Danhong injection
up-regulate Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 mRNA transcriptions
compared with MCAO rat, but 0.9 ml/kg had no effect.
The dosage of 1.8 ml/kg is a clinical equivalent dose. It
also confirmed that the clinical dose is rational and effective. Meanwhile, it has similar changes in expression of the
Nrf2 and HO-1 but not NQO1 in Neuro-2A cell. The difference of the NQO1 mRNA transcription between the
in vitro and in vivo experiments might because of the
difference of the cell type or drug exposure time.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provided insight into the pharmacological functions of Danhong injection. It activates
endogenous biological antioxidant defense systems and
stimulates neuronal survival, improves ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain damage, which was associated with
Nrf2 levels to exert its neuroprotective effects.
