Background: We previously demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) reduces infarct size
after mechanical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic mice
expressing human leukocyte antigen DR2 (DR2-Tg). Clinically, tPA limits ischemic damage by dissolving
the clot blocking blood ﬂow through a cerebral artery. To mimic the clinical situation, we developed a
new mouse model of thromboembolic stroke, and tested the efﬁcacy of tPA in WT and DR2-Tg mice.
New Method Autologous blood is withdrawn into a PE-8 catheter ﬁlled with 2 IU ␣-thrombin. After
exposing the catheter brieﬂy to air, the catheter is reintroduced into the external (ECA) and advanced into
the internal carotid artery (ICA) to allow for intravascular injection of thrombin at the MCA bifurcation.
To validate the model, we tested the effect of tPA on laser-Doppler perfusion (LDP) over the MCA territory
and infarct size in WT and DR2-Tg mice.
Results: The procedure results in a consistent drop in LDP, and leads to a highly reproducible ischemic
lesion. When administered at 15 min after thrombosis, tPA restored LDP and resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction in infarct size at 24 h after thrombosis in both WT and DR2-Tg.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Our model signiﬁcantly reduces surgery time, requires a single anesthesia exposure, and produces a consistent and predictable infarction, with low variability and mortality.
Conclusion: We validated the efﬁcacy of tPA in restoring blood ﬂow and reducing infarct in a new model
of endovascular thromboembolic stroke in the mouse.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and a leading cause
of serious, long-term disability in the United States (Towﬁghi and
Saver, 2011). Approximately 87% of acute strokes are ischemic (Go
et al., 2013), in which the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is most frequently affected (Gillum, 2002). Ischemic stroke occurs as a result of
cerebral thrombosis or embolism. Cerebral thrombosis is the most
common type of ischemic stroke (Zhang et al., 2013; Casals et al.,
2011), which refers to a thrombus that develops at the clogged part
of cerebral vessel due to atherosclerosis of brain arteries, caused by
a build-up of fatty deposits inside the blood vessels. An embolus is
most often a piece of a thrombus that has broken free and travels
to brain usually from an atherosclerotic plaque or heart.
Several stroke models have been developed in rodents to mimic
ischemic stroke in humans, including the mechanical (intraluminal
ﬁlament) occlusion model (Longa et al., 1989; Belayev et al., 1996;
Kitagawa et al., 1998; Hata et al., 2000), the embolic (ﬁbrin-rich clot)
occlusion model (Overgaard et al., 1992; Busch et al., 1997; Zhang
et al., 1997a, b, 2005; Ren et al., 2012) and the photochemical insitu thrombosis occlusion model (Yao et al., 1996; Cai et al., 1998;
Watson et al., 2002; Yao et al., 2003). These models were useful
in understanding the consequences of cerebral ischemia, although
none reﬂected the natural course and pathophysiology of cerebral
thrombosis (Hossmann, 2012). Zhang et al. (1997c) described a rat
thrombotic stroke model, whereby an autologous clot is formed as
a result of direct injection of thrombin endovascularly. A mouse
model of in situ thromboembolic stroke has also been described,
in which an autologous thrombus is directly induced inside the
MCA by local microinjection of puriﬁed thrombin, resulting in a stable and reproducible infarct volume with low mortality rate (Orset
et al., 2007, p. 23; Ansar et al., 2014). However, this model requires
craniotomy, penetration of dura mater and may alter intracranial
pressure (ICP). Finally, and more recently, an atherothrombotic
model of stroke in rats and mice was developed by collagen injection directly into the cerebral circulation (Schunke et al., 2015).
Authors note, however, that in the mouse, the model produces
multifocal strokes with variable size infarcts.
In the present study, we developed a reproducible thromboembolic mouse model with low mortality and variability, which
requires short surgery time and a single anesthesia exposure. The
model, which is based on the endovascular introduction of autologous blood and thrombin, was used in wild-type (WT) mice and
mice expressing human leukocyte antigen DR2 transgene (DR2-Tg),
to test the effect of thrombolysis by intravenous administration of
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on infarct size and
cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) recovery. We have previously demonstrated that Recombinant T Cell Receptor Ligands (RTL), partial MHC
class II (pMHC) molecules covalently bound to myelin peptides,
reverse brain tissue inﬁltration by leukocytes, which contributes
to increased infarct size and worse outcome after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) (Subramanian et al., 2009). However, the

potential application of RTL therapy to human stroke is limited by
the need to match recipient MHC class II with the pMHC construct.
In order to test the efﬁcacy of human pMHC in experimental stroke,
we used humanized transgenic mice, which express the human
MHC class II region carrying the HLA-DR2 haplotype (DR2-Tg mice).
For RTL therapy to be used in humans, it has to be combined with
tPA, the standard stroke therapy. Therefore, in addition to using
wild-type (WT) in the current study, we also validated tPA therapy in DR2-Tg mice, in anticipation of combining tPA with pMHC
therapy in future studies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of animals in
research, and protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committees at Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland
Veteran Affairs Medical Center.
Male C57BL/6 mice (WT, 10–14 weeks of age, 23–28 g body
weight) were purchased form Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA,
USA) and male HLA-DRB1*1502 transgenic mice (DR2-Tg, 10–14
weeks of age and weighing 23–28 g), which are also on a C57BL/6
background, were produced at the Portland VA Medical Center
using foundation breeders provided by Dr. Chella David (Zhu et al.,
2014). The mice were housed in temperature-controlled rooms on
a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle with water and food ad libitum. Mice were randomized to one of the following experimental
groups: sham surgery, control (experimentally naïve) group and a
treatment group (vehicle or tPA). Surgeons were blinded to treatment groups.
2.2. Pre-surgery catheter preparation
The tip of a PE-8 tubing (inner diameter (I.D.): 0.20 mm, outer
diameter (O.D.): 0.35 mm, Strategic Applications Inc., Lake Villa, IL,
USA) was stretched under a heating lamp to further reduce its O.D.
to 0.23–0.25 mm. This will also smooth the catheter’s tip and make
it more ﬂexible, decreasing the risk of damaging vessel wall by the
rigid tubing and sharp tip. A 31-gage small hub removable needle (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) was inserted into a 15-cm long
modiﬁed PE-8 catheter and attached to a 50 ␮L Hamilton syringe
(Model 1705 RN SYR, Reno, NV, USA). Bovine ␣-thrombin (10 ␮L,
0.2 NIHU/␮L; T7513, Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
ﬁlled into catheter and syringe and subsequently stored at 4 ◦ C until
needed for infusion.
2.3. Animal model
Mice were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane for induction,
and anesthesia was maintained with 1.0–1.5% isoﬂurane in

Y. Chen et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 256 (2015) 203–211

O2 -enrichedair using a face mask. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 ◦ C with warm water pads and heating lamp
during surgery. During recovery, we keep a warm water pad set
at 36.5 ◦ C under the cage. Under the operating microscope, the
right common (CCA), external (ECA) and internal carotid arteries
(ICA) were exposed through a 2-cm midline incision in the front
of the neck. The ECA was cauterized and transected. The ICA was
then carefully isolated to avoid damage to the Vagus nerve. A 6-0
suture (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) was tied loosely at the

205

origin of the ECA. The right CCA and ICA were temporarily suspended using 6-0 suture. A modiﬁed PE-8 catheter, ﬁlled with 2
NIHU ␣-thrombin (10 ␮L of 0.2 NIHU/␮L) was gently introduced
into the ECA lumen through a small puncture. The suture around the
origin of the ECA was tightened around the intraluminal catheter
to prevent bleeding. A sample of 3 ␮L blood was withdrawn from
ECA into this catheter, which was then exposed to air for 15 min
to accelerate clot formation at the tip of the catheter (Fig. 1C).
The sutures on the CCA and ICA were temporarily tightened;

8-mm length of catheter was reintroduced into the ECA and gently
advanced 7–8 mm into ICA (Fig. 1B). At this point, the tip of the
intraluminal catheter was 1–2 mm from the origin of the MCA.
The blood clots and 50% of the thrombin were briskly injected to
occlude the vessel, which was conﬁrmed by the sudden drop in
laser-Doppler perfusion (LDP; <30% of baseline) over the MCA territory (Fig. 1E). The rest of thrombin was then very gently injected
over 1 min making sure LDP remained low. At 10 min after injection, the catheter was withdrawn and the right ECA was ligated. The
suture on the right CCA was released at 60 min after onset of occlusion. For sham surgeries, the right CCA was ligated for 60 min and
the modiﬁed PE-8 catheter was placed in the ECA, but not advanced
into ICA. No blood was withdrawn and no thrombin was injected in
sham animals. Physiological variables (blood pressure, blood gases
and rectal temperature) were measured in a separate group of mice
under anesthesia at baseline and at 60 min after thrombin injection. Mice were then allowed to recover from anesthesia in cages
(with warming pads) and brieﬂy re-anesthetized to measure rectal temperature again at 3 h after occlusion (thrombin injection) to
measure body temperature during recovery.
2.4. Monitoring laser-Doppler perfusion (LDP)
During the procedure, cerebrocortical perfusion was monitored
by laser-Doppler (Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Inc., Wilmington,
DE, USA) using a metal probe afﬁxed to the surface of right side of
the skull at the mid-point between the right ear and right eye (core
of MCA territory). LDP was measured before CCA ligation (baseline),
and measurements continued throughout procedure and 5 min
after release of CCA ligature (Fig. 1E). Animals were excluded if LDP
did not drop below 30% of baseline after all thrombin was infused
(Zhu et al., 2014).
2.5. Treatment with recombinant human tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA)

0.17 mg/mL polysorbate 80 and 15 mg/mL phosphoric acid in sterile water. Investigators were fully blinded to treatment code during
both surgery and analysis of infarct size.
2.6. Measurement of ischemic lesion volume
Mice were euthanized and brains collected at 24 h after
occlusion for measurement of infarct size using 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
histology and digital image analysis, as previously described
(Chen et al., 2012). Four slices of 2-mm thick coronal sections
were incubated in 1.2% TTC for 15 min at 37 ◦ C, then ﬁxed in 10%
formalin overnight. Images were analyzed using Sigma Scan Pro
5.0 Software (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). To
control for edema, infarct size in each region (cortical, striatal
and total hemispheric infarct) was determined by subtracting
the ipsilateral non-infarcted tissue volume from the volume
of the contralateral region, then dividing the difference by the
contralateral region volume. The ratio is multiplied by 100 to yield
regional infarct volume as a percent of the contralateral region.
Investigators were fully blinded to treatment code during both
surgery and analysis of infarct size.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Data is presented as mean ± SD, and “n” refers to the number
of mice. Differences among groups in infarct size were evaluated
by one-way ANOVA with the Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc
test. Survival and success rates were compared using two-sided
Fisher’s exact test or Chi-Square test. Statistical signiﬁcance was set
at p < 0.05. Physiological variables in Table 1 were evaluated using
two-away ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat Statistical Software, Version 3.1 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
3. Results

To test the efﬁcacy of tPA in this thromboembolic model, human
recombinant tPA (Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) was
administered intravenously (I.V.) via the right jugular vein at a dose
of 10 mg/kg body weight. Ten percent of tPA was given as a bolus
and the remaining 90% was administered by continuous infusion
over 30 min starting at 15 min of occlusion (thrombin injection)
using a Syringe Pump (Model 1140-001; Harvard Apparatus, MA,
USA; Zhu et al., 2014). The control group received the vehicle in
which tPA is dissolved, which consisted of 52.5 mg/mL l-arginine,

3.1. Success rate and physiological monitoring
A total of 72 mice (half WT and half DR2-Tg) were used in the tPA
treatment study. Mice within each strain were separated into three
— 12 per
groups: untreated and tPA- and vehicle-treated groups (n —
group). A total of 12 (17%) mice were excluded from the study
because of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; 2 mice out of 12), failure to advance catheter or based on LDP exclusion criterion (failure
to drop to less than 30% of baseline). Success rate and survival

of animals up to 24 h after surgery are shown in Table 2. Overall
surgical success and 24-hour survival rates were not statistically
different among the 3 treatment groups in either WT orDR2-Tg
mouse. Rectal temperatures at end-ischemia (60 min MCAO) and
at 3 h after thrombin injection were 36.6 ± 0.1 and 34.5 ± 0.3 in
sham animals (n —
— 4), 36.5 ± 0.2 and 31.2 ± 0.5 in untreated ani◦
mals (n —

—
(n — 4), respectively. Arterial blood pressure, pH and pCO2 were
maintained within their normal range prior to occlusion (pO2
was above 200 mmHg due to use of oxygen-enriched gas mixture; Table 1). At 60-min after thrombin injection, pCO2 increases
above baseline in all groups, including sham animals. Blood pressure decreased slightly, but was statistically signiﬁcant only in the
untreated group. Finally, pH decreased in both groups subjected to
ischemia relative to sham, regardless of tPA treatment.

mice), and when ligature was release after 60 min, LDP quickly
returned to normal, resulting in no apparent infarcts by TTC
staining at 24 h later (data not shown). After introduction of
autologous blood and thrombin, LDP in the ipsilateral MCA territory dropped precipitously to 10% of baseline in all groups
(Fig. 1E) and was restored close to baseline after tPA treatment (Fig. 2). No signiﬁcant differences in LDP were observed
between the untreated and vehicle-treated groups at any time
point during occlusion. Treatment with tPA restores perfusion
approximately 15 min after start of tPA infusion. There was a significant increase in LDP response to tPA at all-time points compared

to vehicle-treated and untreated groups in both WT and DR2-Tg
mice.
3.3. Effect of tPA on infarct size
Injection of the clot and thrombin resulted in a signiﬁcant
infarct in the untreated and vehicle-treated WT and DR2-Tg mice
at 24 h after MCAO. No differences were observed in cortical, striatal, hippocampal or total hemispheric infarcts between untreated
and vehicle-treated groups (Figs. 3 and 4). In both strains of
mice, treatment with tPA starting at 15 min after MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced the size of cortical, striatal, hippocampal and total
hemispheric infarcts compared to the untreated or vehicle-treated
groups (Figs. 3 and 4). Infarct size and its distribution were highly
reproducible, as detected by TTC staining (Fig. 4, with hippocampal infarct highlighted). No hemorrhage was observed within the
infarction zone in either of the groups. The coefﬁcient of variation
(CV) for infarct size in untreated mice was 0.2 and 0.5 with tPA
treatment.
4. Discussion
Remarkable success has recently been achieved in treating acute
ischemic stroke and decreasing associated mortality. Nevertheless,

the only approved therapy for acute thromboembolic stroke
remains thrombolysis using tPA given to selected patients within
the ﬁrst 4.5 h after the onset of symptoms (Hacke et al., 2008;
Wahlgren et al., 2008). Furthermore, recanalization efﬁcacy is far
from optimal, as only 20–40% of patients treated with tPA achieve
partial or full recanalization (Saver, 2011; del Zoppo et al., 1992).
Moreover, potential side effects of tPA, such as hemorrhage, may
aggravate stroke injury and offset the beneﬁts provided by reperfusing an occluded artery. Development of new therapies requires
the availability of reproducible animal models that faithfully model
human stroke as essential tools of preclinical research.
Over the past three decades, several stroke models have been
developed in rodents and used to investigate the pathophysiology
of ischemia and to discover novel therapeutic targets for ischemic
stroke (Table 3). Mechanical occlusion of cerebral vessels, such
as the intraluminal suture MCAO model, was developed to study
downstream ischemic changes subsequent to vascular occlusion,
but is not suitable to study thrombolysis. Embolic stroke models,
on the other hand, mimic the pathophysiology of human stroke
more closely, and are appropriate to study therapies targeting the
occluding thrombus. Current thromboembolic stroke models in
rodents introduce well-formed blood clots, which require 1–2 days
to mature ex vivo. Other models require invasive surgeries, injection of laser-activated dyes, invasive surgery or collagen injection.

More importantly, these models lack reproducibility and uniformity in infarct size and location (Ren et al., 2012). Thrombosis
is a dynamic process, which in living tissue results from various
combinations of stasis, hyper-coagulation and endothelial injury,
collectively known as Virchow’s triad (Bagot and Arya, 2008). In
our model, which uses young healthy mice, endothelial injury is
minimal, and may result from intravascular catheter introduction.
The more important triggers of thrombosis in our model are local
hypercoagulation induced by thrombin and the reduction in blood
ﬂow (stasis) due to CCA ligation (Table 1).
Our model has unique features, which gives it an advantage over
existing thromboembolic rodent models of ischemic stroke. Most
importantly, the model produces a predictable and reproducible
focal infarction with low variability and low mortality, mostly
attributed to the precise localization of thrombosis. The coefﬁcient
of variation (CV) for infarct in untreated mice in our study was 0.2.

Not surprisingly, CV increases to 0.5 with tPA treatment. The CV of
infarct volume in rodent experimental stroke models has a wide
range between 0.05 and 2, depending on the model, choice of anesthetic and how well physiological and hemodynamic variables are
controlled, among other factors (Liu et al., 2009). Similarly, Zhang
et al. (2012) found that infarct location and size were highly variable
in mouse stroke models, with the thromboembolic model showing
highest variability in infarct size of 0.44 and lowest 7-day survival.
Exposure of 3 ␮L of fresh blood to air for only 15 min results in a
fragile and not fully formed clot because the blood and thrombin do
not mix well within the thin catheter (Fig. 1C and D). Injecting the
unformed clot near the origin of MCA, where blood ﬂow is already
low due to CCA ligation, results in thrombus formation and prevents blood ﬂow through ACA and MCA (Fig. 1B and F). Thrombin
has a very short half-life time (1–2 min; Siller-Matula et al., 2011),
resulting in clot formation at the MCA/ACA bifurcation, without

downstream expansion or migration of the clot. In support of this,
no apparent infarction was observed outside the MCA territory, in
contralateral hemisphere or in any other organ outside the brain. As
seen in Fig. 1F, precise lodging of thrombus at the MCA/ACA bifurcation was conﬁrmed by visual inspection of the Circle of Willis.
Finally, survival rate in our model exceeded 90%.
Our model produces stroke in a relatively short period of time.
The time from skin incision to catheter withdrawn after MCA occlusion was kept at less than 1 h by two trained surgeons. The model
requires only a single anesthesia exposure. Zhang et al. reported a
mouse focal cerebral ischemia model with a ﬁbrin-rich embolus,
but their model requires donor mice and over 24 h for clot preparation (Zhang et al., 1997a,b,c; Zhang et al., 2005). Our endovascular
approach for clot delivery allows precise placement of the clot,
avoiding craniotomy and penetration of the dura mater.
Relevance of an animal model needs to be validated against
standard of care for clinical stroke therapy by demonstrating a beneﬁcial response tPA using relevant doses, administration routes and
timing. Although tPA has previously been shown to afford beneﬁt
in thromboembolic stroke models, these studies were performed
in the rat, with no reports in the mouse. With widespread use of
genetically modiﬁed transgenic and gene-deleted mice in stroke
research (Hossmann, 1998), it is import to have a validated mouse
model of stroke and tPA therapy. Our study is ﬁrst to show beneﬁt
of tPA in a mouse model of thromboembolic stroke.
In measuring temperature during recovery, we observed low
body temperature in mice at hours after thromboembolic stroke,
which may be related to reduced activity (Barber et al., 2004). This
response is in contrast to what is observed in the rat, which shows
hyperthermia after stroke (Reglodi et al., 2000). In agreement with
our study, Barber et al. (2004) found that after 45 min of MCAO,
rectal temperature dropped to 33.1 ± 2.3 ◦ C for the ﬁrst 4 h after
the end of surgical temperature regulation, and despite warming efforts, temperature only reached 34.94 ± 0.8 ◦ C. Similarly, in
a recent study by Wu et al. (2014), rectal temperature decreased
after MCAO over the ﬁrst 10 h after MCAO compared to baseline,
which reached lowest value (33.23 ± 0.57 ◦ C) at 1 h after MCAO and
increased thereafter. At 12 h after MCAO, the temperature of control
group eventually returned to normal without signiﬁcant difference
compared to baseline (37.11 ± 0.30 ◦ C). In the “temperature controlled” group, where mice were recovered in a 37 ◦ C incubator,
rectal temperature, nevertheless, was lower than baseline over the
ﬁrst 7 h after MCAO, with lowest value of around 35 ◦ C recorded at
1 h after MCAO (Wu et al., 2014).
In summary, we have developed a novel thromboembolic stroke
model in the mouse, which uses an endovascular approach, and
we have validated the model using tPA. Our model signiﬁcantly
reduces surgery time, requires a single anesthesia exposure, and
produces consistent and predictable infarction, with low variability and mortality. The model will contribute to studies aimed at
understanding stroke pathophysiology and the development of
stroke therapies, especially studies performed in genetically altered
mice.
