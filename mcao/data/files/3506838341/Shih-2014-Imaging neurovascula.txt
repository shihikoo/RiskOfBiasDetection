Negative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response in the striatum has been observed in several studies during
peripheral sensory stimulation, but its relationship between local ﬁeld potential (LFP) remains to be elucidated. We performed
cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI and LFP recordings in normal rats during graded noxious forepaw stimulation at nine stimulus
pulse widths. Albeit high LFP–CBV correlation was found in the ipsilateral and contralateral sensory cortices (r ¼ 0.89 and 0.95,
respectively), the striatal CBV responses were neither positively, nor negatively correlated with LFP (r ¼ 0.04), demonstrating that
the negative striatal CBV response is not originated from net regional inhibition. To further identify whether this negative CBV
response can serve as a marker for striatal functional recovery, two groups of rats (n ¼ 5 each) underwent 20- and 45-minute middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were studied. No CBV response was found in the ipsilateral striatum in both groups immediately
after stroke. Improved striatal CBV response was observed on day 28 in the 20-minute MCAO group compared with the 45-minute
MCAO group (Po0.05). This study shows that fMRI signals could differ signiﬁcantly from LFP and that the observed negative CBV
response has potential to serve as a marker for striatal functional integrity in rats.

INTRODUCTION
The striatum receives afferent inputs from cerebral cortex,
ventromedial, ventrolateral, and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei
and projects major efferent outputs to globus pallidus interna/
externa and substantia nigra pars reticulata.1 It plays a pivotal role
in several neurodegenerative disorders and regulating motor
behavior. Recent reports showed that unilateral noxious forepaw
electrical stimulation in rats evoked sustained negative blood
oxygenation level dependent (BOLD), cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF),
and cerebral blood volume (CBV) functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) responses in the bilateral striatum with no
signiﬁcant difference between two hemispheres,2–6 while the
neuronal spike and c-Fos activities increased.6 This negative
response has also been observed in epileptic rats during whisker
stimulation7 or normal rats during direct nerve stimulation.8
Functional magnetic resonance imaging response has been
shown to correlate better with local ﬁeld potential (LFP) instead
of spike;9 however, whether this particular negative fMRI response
matches with LFP changes remains unclear.
Nociceptive stimuli have been shown to reliably evoke this
intriguing negative fMRI responses in the rat striatum under alphachloralose anesthesia,2,5,6,10 medetomidine sedation,4 or medetomidine combined with light isoﬂurane (0.4%) anesthesia.3 This

stimulation model has potential to serve as a functional imaging
marker for striatal functional integrity for various types of
preclinical applications in rodents. Nevertheless, a stable model
for longitudinal imaging of striatal function is missing. Alphachloralose is not an ideal anesthetic for survival study because of
its gastrointestinal inﬂammatory effect,11 while the sedative effect
of medetomidine is time dependent and is not ideal for studies
with longer experimental time.12 In contrast, soﬂurane is the most
widely used anesthetics for small animal imaging. Robust and
repeatable fMRI responses have been shown in the primary
somatosensory cortex (S1) in well-ventilated rats under isoﬂurane
anesthesia.13–15 Whether the aforementioned negative striatal
fMRI response can be observed under isoﬂurane anesthesia
remain unknown. The ability to do so could have long-term
applications to assess striatal function during disease progression
as well as monitor treatment effects in vivo.
To these ends, we used a well-established CBV fMRI technique
in mechanically ventilated rats under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Nine
forepaw stimulus pulse widths (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and
30 milliseconds) were studied, with ﬁxed 10 mA amplitude known
to generate optimal CBV decreases2,4,6 and 12 Hz stimuli known
to evoke robust CBF and LFP responses in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) under 1% to 1.2% isoﬂurane anesthesia.13,14,16

fMRI of the striatum in normal and stroke rats
Y-YI Shih et al

1484
Local ﬁeld potentials were recorded at the ipsilateral S1 (iS1),
contralateral S1 (cS1), and ipsilateral striatum (iCPu) in separate
animals under identical experimental conditions to corroborate
the fMRI ﬁndings. Contralateral CPu (cCPu) response was not
recorded because of our hardware limitation and the fact that no
difference was detected between the two hemispheres in this
model.2–6 To investigate whether the striatal negative fMRI
response can serve as a marker for striatal functional integrity,
we used stimulation of 10 mA, 3 milliseconds pulse width, and
12 Hz in two groups of rats underwent 20- and 45-minute middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and followed the fMRI responses
up to 28 days.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
A total of 33 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 250 to 300 g, 8 to
10 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories) were studied. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization
Committee, UT Health Science Center at San Antonio and were performed
under ARRIVE guidelines. Animals were housed in the vivarium (12:12-hour
light–dark cycle, controlled humidity and temperature) with free access to
food and water. In the ﬁrst study (imaging striatal function), 11 normal rats
were used to determine the optimal CBV fMRI responses with varied pulse
widths under isoﬂurane anesthesia and 5 normal rats were used to
investigate the corresponding LFP responses under the same experimental
conditions. In the second study (imaging striatal functional recovery), two
groups of 5 rats each were included to longitudinally study the striatal
function and functional recovery with different occlusion time before and
after stroke up to 28 days. Of note, 3 additional rats in the second study
died before the last imaging time point (day 28) and were excluded from
the sample size pool. In addition, a group of 4 rats were used to verify
whether the striatal functional recovery has a neural origin and an
additional group of 5 rats were used to study the effect of varying pulse
width on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate.

Animal Preparation
Rats were initially anesthetized with 3% isoﬂurane and orotracheally
intubated for mechanical ventilation (Model 683, Harvard Apparatus, South
Natick, MA, USA). After the animal was secured in an MRI-compatible rat
stereotactic headset, isoﬂurane was reduced to 1% to 1.2%. End-tidal CO2
was continuously monitored via a capnometer (Surgivet, Smith Medical,
Waukesha, WI, USA) and kept between 3% and 3.5%. Noninvasive end-tidal
CO2 values were calibrated against invasive blood-gas samplings under
identical baseline conditions, resulting an arterial pCO2 of 37.6±4.7 mm Hg
(mean±s.d., n ¼ 8).17 Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.01C±0.51C
with warm-water circulating pad. Heart rate and blood oxygen saturation
level were continuously monitored by a MouseOx system (STARR Life
Science Corp., Oakmont, PA, USA). The heart rate was kept between 350
and 400 bpm and oxygen saturation level was maintained above 97%.
An established CBV fMRI technique was employed18 by using high-dose
30-mg/kg monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles to eliminate potential
BOLD contamination.

Stimulation
In the ﬁrst study, two needle electrodes were inserted under the skin of
the right forepaw: one between the ﬁrst and second digits and the other
between the third and fourth digits. These electrodes were then ﬁxed with
surgical tape and the stimulation was conﬁrmed by observing digit
twitching. Nine forepaw stimulus pulse widths (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10,
and 30 milliseconds) were studied in a pseudo-random manner, with ﬁxed
10 mA amplitude generating optimal CBV decreases2,4,5 and 12-Hz square
wave providing robust CBF and LFP responses under 1% to 1.2% isoﬂurane
anesthesia.13,14,16 This stimulation amplitude is known to induce pain and
therefore striatal responses.3,6 Strong digit and forelimb twitching was
observed during noxious stimulation. However, no or noticeable motion
artifact was detected. In addition, the subjects showed no physical damage
in the ear canal at the end of the experiment, indicating the animal head
was secured and stabilized by the ear bars during imaging, and the
anesthesia level used in this study should be sufﬁcient to suppress major
motion. Two to ﬁve repeated trials were made for each pulse width. In the
second study (imaging striatal functional recovery), needle electrodes were
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1483 – 1492

inserted under the skin of the left and right forepaw, such that both
forepaws were stimulated simultaneously in series at 10 mA, 12 Hz, and 3
milliseconds pulse width. To evaluate the effect of varying stimulus pulse
width, MABP and heart rate were measured via a PE-50 tubing cannulated
to femoral artery. For all stimulations, at least 3 minutes break was given
between trials.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging Experiments
In the ﬁrst study (imaging striatal function) on normal rats (n ¼ 11), MR
images were acquired on a 7 T, 30-cm bore magnet and a 40 G/cm
gradient (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). A custom-made circular surface coil
(ID B2 cm) was placed on the rat head. Magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity was
optimized using standard FASTMAP shimming with ﬁrst-order shims on an
isotropic voxel of 7  7  7 mm encompassing the imaging slices.
A T2-weighted pilot image was taken in the midsagittal plane to localize
the anatomic position by identifying the anterior commissure (bregma
 0.8 mm).19 Cerebral blood volume fMRI was acquired with single-shot
gradient echo-planar imaging sequence using spectral width ¼ 300 kHz,
repetition time/echo time ¼ 1,000/13.8 milliseconds, partial Fourier
acquisition ¼ 5/8, ﬁeld of view ¼ 2.56  2.56 cm2, slice thickness ¼ 1.5 mm,
number of slice ¼ 7, and matrix ¼ 96  96. Functional magnetic resonance
imaging paradigm included 60 sets of echo-planar images before
stimulation, 30 sets during stimulation, and 60 sets after stimulation.
In the second study (imaging striatal functional recovery), rats were
subjected to 20-minute (n ¼ 5) and 45-minute (n ¼ 5) MCAO. Reperfusion
was performed by withdrawing the occluder into the external carotid
artery, restoring blood ﬂow to the brain. To achieve 20-minute MCAO,
we unfortunately could not perform CBF MRI before reperfusion. For the
20-minute MCAO group, MR images were longitudinally acquired at
control time point, (3 to 5 days before MCAO), on day 0 (immediately after
MCAO and reperfusion), day 7, and day 28 after MCAO (total of 20 MRI
experiments). Imaging time points were essentially the same for the
45-minute MCAO group except the control (pre-MCAO) data were not
acquired (total of 15 MRI experiments).
In addition to the fMRI, quantitative CBF and apparent diffusion
coefﬁcient (ADC) were measured before monocrystalline iron oxide
nanoparticle injection and fMRI runs. CBF was acquired by continuous
arterial spin-labeling technique with a separate neck coil for labeling using
single-shot, gradient echo-planar imaging, spectral width ¼ 300 kHz,
repetition time/echo time ¼ 3,000/10.3 milliseconds, partial Fourier
acquisition ¼ 5/8, labeling duration ¼ 2.46 seconds, postlabeling delay ¼
0.25 seconds, ﬁeld of view ¼ 2.56  2.56 cm2, slice thickness ¼ 1.5 mm, and
acquisition matrix ¼ 96  96. Sixty pairs of images were acquired for signal
averaging. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired with singleshot, spin-echo, echo-planar imaging along 30 diffusion encoding
directions with b value ¼ 0 and 1.2 milliseconds/mm2 with same localization and resolution as CBF. Other imaging parameters were: d/D ¼ 4/16
milliseconds, repetition time ¼ 3,000 milliseconds, and echo time ¼ 35
milliseconds. Acquisitions were repeated four times to increase signal-tonoise ratio.

Electrophysiology Recording
In the ﬁrst study (imaging striatal function), electrophysiology was
performed in a separate group of rats (n ¼ 5). The procedure was
essentially the same as that described previously.20 A stereotaxic frame
(Model 900, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) was used to
position the head. The animal physiologic conditions were kept the same
as the MRI experiment, except craniotomies were performed to implant
recording electrodes. A stainless steel screw was placed 2-mm caudal to
lambda as a reference electrode. After the dura was removed, custom
designed polyimide-based 16-channel microelectrode arrays21 with
inter-contact spacing of 74 mm were implanted to cS1, iS1 (coordinates
from bregma: anterior-posterior þ 0.5 mm; medial-lateral ±4 mm; and
ventral-dorsal  2 mm; approached with a coronal angle of 22.51), and CPu
(anterior-posterior  0.8 mm; medial-lateral þ 4 mm; and ventral-dorsal
 6.5 mm). Data were sampled from the contact lead located at cortical
layer V (BVD  1.4 mm) or the dorsal striatum (BVD  5.9 mm), and
ﬁltered on a preampliﬁer between 0.3 and 500 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz.
Data were acquired using a Cerebus multichannel data acquisition system
(Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). At the end of the
experiment, a 30-mA direct current was delivered to the deepest contact
lead for 10 seconds to label the recording site. T2-weighted MRI scans were
performed to conﬁrm the recording site. This method is comparable to
histology as it is sufﬁcient to conﬁrm the electrode tip in the target area. In

the second study (imaging striatal functional recovery), LFP was measured
in a separate group of rats (n ¼ 4), underwent 20-minute MCAO to verify
whether neuronal recovery can be observed. The recording parameters
were identical to the ﬁrst study, but with only one electrode implanted into
the iCPu and stimulation of 10 mA, 12 Hz, and 3-millisecond pulse width
was used. Recording was performed longitudinally at four time points
identical to fMRI studies (control, day 0, day 7, and day 28).

Data Analysis
22

Image analysis was performed using a custom-written program in Matlab
(Math-Works, Natick, MA, USA) and statistical parametric mapping.
Automatic coregistration using statistical parametric mapping codes
were applied to realign time-series data to the ﬁrst time point within
subjects using and then again across subjects. Correlation coefﬁcient
analysis was performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to correlate MR signal
changes with electrical stimulation paradigm with a signiﬁcant threshold
of Po0.05 (Bonferroni corrected). Spatial averaging across subjects was
performed to generate averaged correlation coefﬁcient map after atlasbased coregistration as described previously,22 where CBV increases and
decreases are indicated by red–yellow and blue–green colors, respectively.
The stimulus-evoked DR2* value, which varies linearly with the stimulusevoked CBV fraction, was calculated as follows after monocrystalline iron

oxide nanoparticles injection: DR2 ¼ TE
are the MR signal intensities before and during stimulation, respectively.
C  SL
CBF was calculated as: CBF ¼ Tl1 SL þSð2a
 1ÞSC , where SC and SL are the MR
signal intensities from the control and labeled images, respectively; l is the
water brain–blood partition coefﬁcient, T1 is that of tissue, and a is the
arterial spin-labeling efﬁciency. The values of l, T1, and a were 0.9, 1.8
seconds, and 0.7, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefﬁcient maps were
calculated by using: ADC ¼ In(S0/S1)/(b1  b0), where S1 is the signal
intensity obtained with b1 (1.2 milliseconds/mm2) and S0 is the signal
intensity obtained with b0 (0 milliseconds/mm2). Regions of interest (ROIs)
were placed on the cS1, iS1 (both 8  8 pixels) and the iCPu (13  8 pixels)
to extract fMRI time-course data after the images are coregistered. No
apparent spatial shift was observed at different stimulus pulse widths.
Therefore data were analyzed with the same ROIs across trials. Slice at
bregma  0.8 mm was selected for subsequent analysis because this is the
primary area being affected by MCAO and strong cortical and striatal
forepaw fMRI responses were also observed at this location.
Electrophysiology data were analyzed by using a custom-written
program in Matlab. The 30-second raw LFP data were split into 360
sweeps of 83 milliseconds poststimulus periods based on the stimulus time
stamps (12 Hz). The averaged evoked LFP was summated during the 83
milliseconds poststimulus period, denoted as SLFP. Data were then
averaged across subjects to provide group-averaged responses.
Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA). Paired t-test was used to compare the responses between hemispheres. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with Fisher’s post hoc test
was used to compare stimulus-evoked changes in DR2* and SLFP values in
the ﬁrst study, and the DR2*, ADC, CBF, and SLFP values at different time
points in the second study. The signiﬁcance level was set at Po0.05.

Ethics Statement
All studies reported followed the guidelines of the OLAW (Ofﬁce of
Laboratory Animal Welfare) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as well as the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo
Experiments) guidelines. The experiments were approved by the University
of Texas Health Science Center IACUC. The manuscript was written in
accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

Table 1 shows the effect of graded forepaw stimulation on
MABP and heart rate. Representative CBV fMRI images at bregma
þ 0.7 and  0.8 mm are shown in Figure 1A. Stimulation at right
forepaw with 10 mA, 12 Hz, and 3 milliseconds pulse width
resulted in signiﬁcant CBV increases in the cS1 and CBV decreases
in bilateral CPu. Figure 1B shows group-averaged functional CBV
time-course data under nine different pulse widths (0.1 to 30
milliseconds; n ¼ 11). Our previous and current ﬁndings showed

both hemispheres under this stimulation model and therefore the
CPu time-course data were only discussed on the ipsilateral side.
Cerebral blood volume in the cS1 responded immediately to the
stimulation, showing an overshoot at the stimulus onset across all
stimulation conditions that gradually decreased over time. In
contrast, CBV in the CPu responded comparatively slower to the
stimulation and was only apparent at 1 to 5 milliseconds pulses.
Under identical experimental condition, LFPs were recorded at
the cS1, iS1, and CPu (Figure 2A). Typical LFP waveforms are
shown in Figure 2B. In the cS1, LFP peaked at 50 milliseconds after
stimulus onset. This early negative peak was also observed in the
iS1 and CPu. Around 100 milliseconds after stimuli onset, a late
negative peak was also recorded in the iS1 as well as in the CPu
with further delay.23 For all the nine pulse widths tested in this
study, averaged SLFP time courses showed a clear overshoot at
the stimulus onset and decreased over time in the cS1, iS1, and
CPu (Figure 2C). Increased SLFPs were observed in the CPu, which
does not match to the trend of CBV changes.
Figure 3A compared CBV fMRI and SLFP data in cS1, iS1, and
CPu under nine stimulation pulse widths. In the cS1, both CBV
and SLFP increased with pulse width (Po0.05), reaching a peak
around 3 to 10 milliseconds, and then decreased at 30
milliseconds pulses (Po0.05). In the iS1, both CBV and SLFP
increased with stimulus pulse width and reaching a plateau B3 to
5 milliseconds (Po0.05). The peak CBV and SLFP responses were
B3 and 5 times lower compared with the responses in cS1,
respectively. In the CPu, CBV responses were mostly negative and
peaked B1 to 3 milliseconds (Po0.05), while the SLFP responses
were mostly positive and peaked B5 to 10 milliseconds (Po0.05),
similar to that in the cS1. Signiﬁcant correlation was found
between CBV and SLFP in the cS1 (r ¼ 0.89, Po0.05) and the iS1
(r ¼ 0.95, Po0.05), but not in the CPu (r ¼ 0.04, P40.05; Figure 3B).

Striatal and Cortical Apparent Diffusion Coefﬁcient and Cerebral
Blood Flow Changes after Stroke
The group-averaged ADC and CBF maps in the 20- and 45-minute
MCAO groups (n ¼ 5 each) are shown in Figure 4 and their
temporal evolution were analyzed for the cortical and striatal ROIs
as shown in Figure 6.
In the 20-minute MCAO group, reperfusion restored ADC values
in the ROIs and showed no signiﬁcant difference compared with
the contralateral hemisphere on day 0 (P40.05). This may be
because the ischemic lesion core was only partially included in the
iCPu ROI and primarily located at the external globus pallidus.
Ipsilateral striatum showed higher ADC on day 7 and day 28
(Po0.05). Cerebral blood ﬂow values in the iS1 and iCPu
decreased signiﬁcantly on day 0 compared with the contralateral

on day 7 compared with day 0 (Po0.05), but was still signiﬁcantly
lower than cS1 (Po0.05). Cerebral blood ﬂow in the iCPu
increased on day 7 compared with day 0 (Po0.05) and was
signiﬁcantly higher than cCPu (Po0.05). On day 28, CBF in the
iCPu was recovered and was not signiﬁcantly different from cCPu
(P40.05), while the CBF in the iS1 was still signiﬁcantly lower than
the prestroke control and the cS1 (Po0.05).
In the 45-minute MCAO group, signiﬁcant ADC decrease in the
iS1 was found immediately after reperfusion on day 0 (P40.05).
Similar to the 20-minute MCAO group, iCPu also showed a slightly

lower ADC compared with control, but was not signiﬁcantly
different from the cCPu (P40.05). Ipsilateral striatum showed
higher ADC on day 7 and day 28 (Po0.05). On day 28, the ADC
was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the 20-minute MCAO
group (Po0.05). Cerebral blood ﬂow values in both the iS1 and
iCPu were signiﬁcantly lower on day 0 compared with the
contralateral side (Po0.05). On day 7, signiﬁcant hyper-perfusion
was found in the iCPu compared with day 0 as well as to
the matched time point in the 20-minute MCAO group (Po0.05).
Hyper-perfusion in the cortex was apparent on the lateral
side of the brain and the boundary of the hyper-perfused area

Striatal and Cortical Functional Cerebral Blood Volume Changes
after Stroke
In the 20-minute MCAO group (n ¼ 5), stimulation at 12 Hz, 10 mA,
and 3 milliseconds pulse width was applied to both forepaws. At
the control time point, bilateral CBV increases were shown in the
S1 and bilateral CBV decreases was shown in the CPu (Figure 5A
and Figure 6A). After stroke, the CBV fMRI data acquired
immediately after reperfusion (day 0) showed intact functional
responses in the area contralateral to the stroke side (cS1 and
cCPu), while the stimulus-evoked CBV increases in the iS1 reduced
signiﬁcantly compared with the contralateral side and the iS1
response acquired at the prestroke control time point (Po0.05).
The CBV decreases in the iCPu was completely eliminated on day
0 (Po0.05). Compared with day 0, the iS1 response recovered
signiﬁcantly on day 7 (Po0.05). No signiﬁcant difference was
found between cS1 and iS1 responses on day 7 (P40.05), but only
on day 28 (Po0.05). Interestingly, iCPu was hyper-reactive and
showed stronger CBV decreases compared with the contralateral
side, prestroke control data, and day 0 (Po0.05). On day 28, the
iCPu response was weaker than that on day 7 (Po0.05) and
showed no signiﬁcant difference compared with control (P40.05).
In the 45-minute MCAO group (n ¼ 5), identical stimulation was
applied (Figure 5B and Figure 6B). Similar to the 20-minute MCAO
group, the CBV fMRI data, acquired immediately after reperfusion
& 2014 ISCBFM

(day 0), showed no apparent functional response in both iS1 and
iCPu compared with the intact side (Po0.05). However, the iS1
and iCPu responses did not recover up to 28 days. Signiﬁcant
difference was found between the two hemispheres at all time
points (P40.05). Although, there is a tendency that the responses
in the iS1 and cS1 gradually increased over time, no signiﬁcant
difference was detected. Compared with the 20-minute MCAO
group, the CBV decreases in iCPu was signiﬁcantly less on day 7
and day 28 (Po0.05).
Striatal Local Field Potential Changes after Stroke
To verify whether striatal neuronal function is recovered, LFPs
were recorded at the iCPu in a separate group of animals,
underwent 20-minute MCAO (n ¼ 4). Identical stimulation parameters were used. SLFP at the control time point showed no
statistical difference compared with the normal control data in the
ﬁrst study (see Figure 3A, P40.05). SLFP decreased signiﬁcantly
after stroke (day 0, Po0.05). On day 7, SLFP showed a trend of
recovery, but did not reach a signiﬁcant level (P ¼ 0.07). On day 28,
signiﬁcant functional recovery was observed compared with day 0
(Po0.05) and no signiﬁcant difference was detected compared
with prestroke control time point (Figure 6C).

function in the cortex and the striatum was evaluated by
correlating CBV fMRI response with LFP results. This fMRI
procedure was further applied to study striatal functional recovery
in an ischemic stroke model with different occlusion time. The
major ﬁndings were: (i) Cortical and striatal fMRI responses can be
reliably and longitudinally obtained in rats under isoﬂurane
anesthesia; (ii) the positive CBV responses in the S1 peaked B3
to 10 milliseconds pulse width when 12 Hz and 10 mA stimulation
was applied, while the negative CBV responses in the CPu peaked
B1 to 3 milliseconds pulse width; (iii) strong CBV–LFP correlations
as a function of pulse width were observed in the cS1, iS1, but not
in the CPu; (iv) this fMRI procedure provided additional information than ADC and CBF to characterize potential tissue abnormalities, offering a means to evaluate striatal dysfunction in stroke
rats; (v) both fMRI and LFP responses were diminished immediately after stroke and recovered on day 28; and (vi) fMRI data
showed that the 20-minute MCAO group had better recovery than
45-minute MCAO group.
Neurovascular Responses in the Striatum
The striatum involves in various aspects of brain signaling. We
previously found that unilateral noxious electrical stimuli at the rat
forepaw reliably evoked bilateral negative CBV responses in the
striatum under alpha-chloralose anesthesia.6 These responses
correlated with increased neuronal spike activity and increased
Fos-immunoreactive cells. Consistent with the negative CBV
responses, negative BOLD2–4,7,8 and CBF fMRI changes2 were
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1483 – 1492

also found in the striatum during stimulation. These data implied a
unique control of the striatal circulation and the mechanism of
action is potentially via direct control of local vasculature rather
than conventional neurovascular coupling because striatal spike
activity6 or metabolism2 were not reduced during stimulation. It
has been shown that pain signaling may trigger this local vascular
control. Morphine, a m-opioid receptor agonist and a commonly
used pain reliever, enhanced the stimulus-evoked negative striatal
CBV responses and naloxone, a m-opioid receptor antagonist,
eliminated the evoked striatal fMRI responses.5 Antagonism of
dopamine D2-like receptor markedly enhanced pain-related
behavior.24 This was not surprising because opioid and
dopamine D2 systems orchestrate closely. Acute upregulation of
D2-like, but not D1-like receptors was found to occur after
administration of m-opioid receptor agonist.25 Positron-emission
tomography studies using dopamine D2-like radioligands also
support this notion by showing that administration of a m-opioid
receptor agonist signiﬁcantly increased D2-like receptor binding in
both the cortical and the striatal areas.26
Although, little is known about this unique hemodynamic
regulation in the striatum, activation of D2-like receptors has been
shown to induce striatal CBV decreases.27 Injection of D2-like
receptor antagonist also reduced the striatal negative fMRI
responses evoked by noxious forepaw stimuli.5,6,10 These results,
in line with an earlier report,28 implied that dopamine and its
receptors can regulate regional microcirculation. We recently
showed that the striatal CBV decreases in this stimulation model is
associated with the integrity of the dopaminergic innervation.10
The dopaminergic afferents in the striatum were selectively
lesioned by injecting the 6-hydroxydopamine to the substantia
nigra pars compacta, which sends long projecting dopaminergic
efferent ﬁbers to the striatum. Our data showed that the stimulusevoked striatal CBV reduction was almost eliminated on the lesion
side, where the cCPu still showed intact fMRI response. The
remaining fMRI response showed very high spatial correlation
with the residual dopaminergic ﬁbers as revealed by tyrosine
hydroxylase immunostaining.
In this study, we further investigated the striatal fMRI responses
with modulation of nine different pulse widths and showed that
the striatal CBV reduction is also evident under isoﬂurane
anesthesia at certain pulse widths. Frequency, amplitude, and
pulse width are critical parameters for electrical stimuli. It has been
shown that 12-Hz forepaw stimuli evoked robust BOLD and CBF
changes in the S1 under isoﬂurane anesthesia compared with
other frequencies (3, 6, and 20 Hz).14 The striatal CBV reduction
monotonically enhanced with the stimulus amplitude under
different anesthetics/sedative.2,4,6 However, the stimulus pulse
width that determines the amount of charge delivered has not
been previously evaluated. It has been shown that at different
stimulus pulse widths, the nerve ﬁbers recruited by the stimuli
were also different.29 A typical example is that peripheral sensory
ﬁbers are more effectively evoked with longer pulse width than
motor ﬁbers.30
Our fMRI data showed that the cS1 CBV response exhibited two
phases during pulse-width modulation: in phase 1, the responses
increased with pulse width and peaked B3 milliseconds. In phase
2, the responses decreased until 30 milliseconds (the longest
pulse width measured in this study). The increasing response in
phase 1 was because of a larger amount of charges being
delivered to the forepaw and potentially recruited more sensory
units sending action potentials to the S1 region. In contrast, the
decreasing response in phase II may be because of effective
refractory period since long pulse width has been shown to
extend the recovery time course from neural refractoriness.31 This
was also evident in our LFP measurements, showing reduced
SLFP (less synaptic currents being generated) in the cS1 at 30
milliseconds pulse width. Similarly, the fMRI response in the iS1
increased with pulse width, but it did not decline up to 30

milliseconds pulse width. Cerebral blood volume response at
the iS1 can be evoked by the pain pathway that projects
bilaterally, subsequently evoked by the cS1 via callosal projections,
or because of nonspeciﬁc cardiovascular effect.32–34 It has
been shown that transient blood pressure changes could affect
fMRI signals and the stimulus-evoked activation could overlap
with MR signal changes because of MABP increases.33 Despite our
electrophysiological data showed changes in LFP, and the
fMRI responses are highly localized in the target area of interest.
& 2014 ISCBFM

We cannot rule out the potential contribution of cardiovascular
effects on all of the fMRI data presented herein. The SLFP peak
response in the iS1 was several times lower than that
the contralateral side and the responses were far from fully
saturated, so the group neural refractoriness was not obvious.
Both the fMRI pulse-width modulation curves in the cS1 and iS1
were highly correlated with the SLFP. These data from the cortex
also served as within-subject controls for our measurement in
the striatum.

Interestingly, the striatal CBV response showed a band-pass
shape in pulse-width modulation and was only evident at 1 to
3 milliseconds pulse widths. Little or no CBV reduction was
observed with extremely short (0.1 milliseconds) or long pulses
(30 milliseconds). The mechanism leading reduced negative CBV
response at long pulse width is not elusive and warrants further
investigation. fMRI pulse-width modulation curve in the striatum
did not correlate with the corresponding LFP measurement.
During the modulation of pulse width, SLFP responses were
positive, while the fMRI responses were mostly negative. The
shape of the fMRI pulse-width modulation curve may be
attributed to the nonspeciﬁc cardiovascular effect, whereby longer
stimulus pulse width may evoke subsequent positive hemodynamic responses and eliminate striatal negative CBV changes. It is
also plausible that the D2 signaling cascade in the basal ganglia
circuit simply preferred 1 to 3 milliseconds pulse width under our
experimental condition. We speculate that the negative fMRI
response in the striatum is resulted from the process of the local
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1483 – 1492

vasculature that overrides the existing neurovascular coupling
because fMRI responses were neither positively, nor negatively
correlated with the SLFP. Given the striatum has dense and
uniform distribution of the dopamine D2 receptors,35 this unique
signal pattern therefore has the opportunity to serve as an
imaging marker to evaluate striatal function and functional
recovery in vivo. On a separate note, although CBV responses
were consistently observed in the S1 and CPu under our
stimulation protocol, CBV response in the thalamus was not
detected. The S1 and striatum are both important regions in the
pain network,22,36,37 in which the S1 is in the lateral pain system
discriminating the location and intensity of the stimuli,38 whereas
the striatum receives strong projections from the medial pain
system.39 We did not detect thalamic activation, consistent with
a prior study in rats.36 The absence of thalamic activity could
be because of the effect of isoﬂurane on suppressing thalamic
activity40 and/or regional dependence of neurovascular
coupling.41

Striatal Functional Recovery after Stroke
Our data showed that forepaw electrical stimuli at 12 Hz, 10 mA,
and 3 milliseconds pulse width generated robust striatal CBV
reduction under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Three milliseconds pulse
width also generated robust positive fMRI responses in the cortex,
so the stimulus parameters do not need to be compromised for
assessing the function of cortical or striatal region. This protocol
is noninvasive and can be used longitudinally.
To show the feasibility of using this stimulus protocol for
assessing striatal functional recovery in a longitudinal manner, two
groups of rats underwent MCAO (20 and 45 minutes, respectively)
followed by reperfusion were used. The stimulation protocol is
essentially identical except both forepaws were stimulated
simultaneously in series to evoke S1 activation at both hemispheres. Apparent diffusion coefﬁcient and CBF showed similar
trend as our previous reports.42 In the 45-minute MCAO group,
postischemic hyper-perfusion was found on day 7 and striatal ADC
was signiﬁcantly higher on day 28 compared with the 45-minute
MCAO group. As expected, there was a tendency that the 20minute MCAO group (Figure 4) showed better functional
activation and more robust fMRI time course in the iS1 at chronic
time points (day 7 and day 28) compared with the 45-minute
MCAO group (Figure 5), indicating a better functional recovery.
Similarly, the striatal response also showed better recovery in the
20-minute MCAO group. The ipsilateral negative CBV responses in
the striatum were quantitatively stronger on day 7 and day 28 in
the 20-minute MCAO group. The between-group difference in the
iS1 did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. This may be because of
the nature of the MCAO model that the boundary of the ischemicreperfusion insult is usually at the forepaw area of S1 in our
experimental condition.42 Functional recovery/reorganization of
the somatosensory cortex after the stroke has been studied
extensively42–46 and it was expected that shorter MCAO resulted
in signiﬁcantly better functional recovery.
In the 20-minute MCAO group, the ipsilateral striatal negative fMRI
responses were diminished on day 0, hyper-reactive on day 7, and
recovered on day 28. The abnormality of striatal fMRI responses after
stroke could represent impairments of the vascular reactivity or
neural dysfunction. Our data suggested that this abnormality could
have a neural origin as the LFP response was also diminished on day
0 and recovered on day 28. However, a more thorough investigation
on this topic is required to identify the cellular underpinnings of the
negative fMRI signals in disease states. In the 45-minute MCAO group,
the striatal negative fMRI signals did not recover on day 28, showing
that these signals can be manipulated by disease severity. We
suspect that the enhanced-negative fMRI response on day 7 in the
20-minute MCAO group is similar to our previous ﬁndings in normal
subjects, because of the dopamine receptor function. Striatal D2-like
receptor has been reported to upregulate in Parkinson’s disease so as
to compensate the reduced dopamine release in the striatum.47 In
contrast, the D2 receptor has been found to downregulate when the
animals were chronically exposed to quinpirole (a D2-like agonist) for
6 days.48 In a rat model of MCAO, newly generated striatal neurons
expressing dopamine D2-like receptors was found to develop new
efferent projections to the substantia nigra in the adult rat brain after
stroke,49 indicating a potential involvement of the D2-expressing
neurons in restoring striatal function. A potential limitation of the
present study is that bilateral forepaws were stimulated
simultaneously to minimize the scan time for stroke rats. This,
however, precluded the opportunity to identify whether the striatal
hypersensitivity in the 20-minute MCAO group on day 7 was in result
of unilateral or interhemispheric reorganization.

CONCLUSIONS
This study established an fMRI procedure to longitudinally study
striatal neurovascular function under isoﬂurane anesthesia and
& 2014 ISCBFM

showed a novel fMRI application to investigate the striatal
functional integrity after 20- or 45-minute MCAO. One advantage
of this procedure is that no receptor-speciﬁc pharmaceutical
ligand is involved and the response is evoked via peripheral
stimuli reﬂecting endogenous brain signaling. High CBV–LFP
correlation was found in the somatosensory cortex, but not in the
striatum during stimulus pulse-width modulation. Our data
unambiguously showed that negative CBV response could appear
with positive LFP changes. We suspect that the negative fMRI
response in the striatum originates from direct modulation of local
vascular activity and overrides the activation-induced hyperemia.
Our approach offers a means to evaluate striatal dysfunction and
functional recovery in animal models. Future studies will combine
optogenetic and pharmacogenetic techniques to dissect the
contribution of different striatal neurons to the negative fMRI
signals.
