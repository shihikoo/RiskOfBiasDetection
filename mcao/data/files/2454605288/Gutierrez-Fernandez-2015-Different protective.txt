Angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have induced
improved functional recovery and reduced infarct volume
in experimental animal models of stroke. Clinical data
have indicated a positive correlation between prestroke
treatment with ARBs and reduced stroke severity and better outcomes; however, the mechanisms of these beneficial effects are not yet well understood. This study
compares the protective and possible reparative effects of
continuous oral treatment with olmesartan (OLM) with
OLM pretreatment and withdrawal after permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in rats. Fifty-two
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five
groups: MCAO–/OLM (OLM 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days
after infarct), MCAOOLM/OLM (OLM 10 mg/kg/day for
7 days before and 14 days after infarct), MCAOOLM/– (OLM
10 mg/kg/day for 7 days before infarct), sham, and control. We analyzed functional recovery; lesion size; cell
death; expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX-4); isolectin-B4; and repair markers such as
glial fibrillary acidic protein, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF). All of the OLM-treated groups showed significantly better functional scores and reduced infarct sizes
and cell death compared with the control group 14 days
after pMCAO. Levels of NOX-4, VEGF, and BDNF were
significantly lower in the brains of the MCAOOLM/OLM and
sham groups compared with the other groups. OLM treatment improved functional recovery and reduced lesion
size and cell death after cerebral ischemia. Only the
continuous administration of OLM before and after
stroke reduced oxidative stress levels, with better
tissue preservation, without triggering brain repair marker
activation. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In recent years, an increasing number of experimental and clinical studies have highlighted the cerebral protective properties of certain antihypertensive drugs,
particularly angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs; Chrysant, 2012). Clinical and experimental data collected from

studies in human and animal models of ischemic stroke
have shown that prestroke treatment with ARBs, such as
olmesartan (OLM), candesartan, and valsartan, is associated
with reduced cerebral infarct volumes and better outcomes
(Hosomi et al., 2005; Ovbiagele et al., 2005; OmuraMatsuoka et al., 2009; Takizawa et al., 2009; Fuentes et al.,
2010; Guan et al., 2011a; Kuwashiro et al., 2012). To translate these findings into clinical practice, a better understanding is required of the effects of ARBs administered before
and after the onset of cerebral ischemia and the mechanisms
behind these effects. This knowledge can further the development of new therapeutic strategies based on ARB
administration in patients with acute stroke.
Recent data suggest that modulation of the rennin–
angiotensin system, in addition to its specific antihypertensive effects, alters other biological functions (Takizawa
et al., 2009; Chrysant, 2012; Guimond and Gallo-Payet,
2012). The effects of this modulation include antiinflammatory effects (Larrayoz et al., 2009; Benicky et al.,
2011; Saavedra, 2012; Omote et al., 2014), inhibition of
apoptosis and reactive microglia at the edge of the infarct
core (Lou et al., 2004), and a significant reduction of oxidative stress after both transient and permanent ischemia
(Li et al., 2008; Takizawa et al., 2009). Tissue integrity

also appears to be altered, and levels of certain matrix
metalloproteinases are diminished in the brains of rats
after continuous OLM administration (Hosomi et al.,
2005). Protective and reparative mechanisms are activated
and work together from the initiation of cerebral ischemia
(Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2012). Treatment with ARBs
has shown protective effects; however, the potential
effects on brain repair response have not been fully investigated. Forder et al. (2005) have shown that prolonged
pretreatment with losartan for 2 weeks before stroke
induces angiogenesis. The authors observed a reduction
in infarct volume to levels at which there were few or no
infarcts. The authors, therefore, have suggested that
induced angiogenesis is responsible, at least in part, for the
protection observed after permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMCAO). Changes in the levels of
trophic factors related to angiogenesis, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, have
been detected 24 hr after treatment with candesartan following transient ischemia (Guan et al., 2011b). It would
therefore be of interest to investigate the possible effects
of treatment with ARBs on brain repair further.
Among the available ARBs, OLM has been shown to
have a more rapid onset and potency equal to or greater
than that of candesartan or losartan (Koike et al., 2001).
OLM treatment resulted in reduced cerebral infarct volumes
and edema and improved neurological scores in experimental animal models (Hosomi et al., 2005; Oyama et al., 2010).
Studies have demonstrated the protective role of OLM
before and after cerebral ischemia under various experimental conditions, such as varied routes of administration, doses,
and experimental models of ischemia. The current study
compares the protective and possible reparative effects of
continuous oral treatment with OLM with OLM pretreatment and withdrawal at 14 days after pMCAO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Subjects
All experiments were designed to minimize animal suffering in compliance with the medical school’s Ethics Committee
for the Care and Use of Research Animals (in accordance with
EU directive 2010/63/UE and the Spanish Royal Decree 53/
2013). The study animals consisted of adult male and female
Sprague-Dawley rats, with body weights ranging from 250 to
320 g (Charles River Laboratories).
Experimental Design
This is a randomized, blind study based on the Stroke
Treatment and Academic Roundtable criteria (STAIR, 1999).
Fifty-two rats were assigned to five groups of 10 animals each
(five males and five females). Two rats were excluded from the
study because one died after surgery and the other died during
the magnetic resonance procedure. The MCAO–/OLM group
was treated with OLM 10 mg/kg/day (Faure et al., 2006;
Kosaka et al., 2013) in drinking water 24 hr after stroke and for
the following 14 days. The MCAOOLM/– group was treated
with OLM 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 7 days before
stroke. The MCAOOLM/OLM group was treated with OLM

Fig. 1. Experimental protocol schematic. The model employed to
induce focal cerebral ischemia was pMCAO. The oral treatment and
pretreatment with OLM was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
The analyzed parameters were at 72 hr, 7 days, and 14 days, a functional evaluation using the Rogers and rotarod tests; at 48 hr and
14 days, lesion size by MRI; at 14 days, lesion size by H&E staining;
at 14 days, histological and molecular analysis of the peri-infarct zone.

10 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 7 days before stroke and for
the following 14 days after stroke. The remaining two groups
(sham and control) were administered the vehicle. The amount
of water that the rats were allowed to drink was controlled and
replaced with fresh water daily. The average daily water intake
was 32 ml and was consistent for all the experimental groups.
The experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1.
pMCAO
The rats were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a
solution of ketamine (25 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg), and atropine (0.1 mg/kg) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg. Analgesia was induced
by subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (2 mg/kg). A small craniectomy was performed, and the right MCA was permanently
ligated just before its bifurcation as previously described (Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2011; Ramos-Cejudo et al., 2012).
Functional Assessment Scales
Functional assessments were performed for all animals at
baseline and 72 hr, 7 days, and 14 days after surgery. All rats
were evaluated by the rotarod test (Gutierrez-Fernandez et al.,
2013) and a variant of the Rogers scale, which consists of a
seven-point behavioral rating scale: 0, no neurological deficit;
1, failure to extend right forepaw fully; 2, decreased grip of the
right forelimb while tail is gently pulled; 3, spontaneous movement in all directions, contralateral circling only if pulled by the
tail; 4, circling or walking to the right; 5, walks only when
stimulated; 6, unresponsive to stimulation with a depressed level
of consciousness; and 7, dead (Rogers et al., 1997; GutierrezFernandez et al., 2011). Starting 3 days before pMCAO, the
rats were trained on an accelerating (4–40 rpm) rotarod. Before
surgery on the same experimental day, the time spent moving
on the rotarod without falling was measured twice per animal,
with a 15-min break between trials. The mean of the two trials
was calculated for each rat.

Measurement of Lesion Size by Magnetic Resonance
Imaging and Hematoxylin-Eosin
The lesion size was analyzed at 48 hr and at 14 days after
surgery by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Bruker Pharmascan, Ettlingen, Germany) with 7-T horizontal bore magnets
and T2 maps (RARE 8 T2, 180 flip angle; three averages).
Ten contiguous coronal slices (1 mm thickness) were acquired
with a 35 3 35 mm field of view and a 256 3 256 matrix (repetition time 3,000 msec, echo time 29.5 msec, imaging time
25.5 min, three averages). The lesion size was determined by an
indirect method: infarct area 5 (area of the intact contralateral
hemisphere) – (area of the intact ipsilateral hemisphere). The
lesion size was expressed as a percentage (Swanson et al., 1990;
Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2013). The lesion size measurements were verified by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining on
slides obtained 14 days after stroke. The samples were coronally
sectioned into 10-lm-thick slices; digital images were made of
these slices (Perfection 1260 scanner; Epson, Nagano, Japan)
and were used to measure the ischemic area automatically
(Image Pro Plus 4.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).
Immunohistochemistry
Cell death was detected by biotin-dUTP nick endlabeling mediated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TUNEL) staining with the TdT-FragEL DNA fragmentation
detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells in the
peri-infarct zone were counted by using a 340 objective on an
optical microscope (BX41; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
For the immunohistochemical studies of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX-4), slides were treated with citrate buffer (pH 6)
at 95 C for 10 min. Anti-NOX-4 (1:1,000; Abnova, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as the primary polyclonal antibody.
After having been washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), the
slides were incubated with the secondary antibody (donkey
anti-rabbit, diluted 1:50) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The slides were again washed
in TBS and incubated with 30 ,30 -diaminobenzidine (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA).
Immunofluorescence and Western Blot
The sections were studied by using the following immunofluorescent antibodies: the neuronal markers neuronal nuclei
(NeuN; monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and neurofilament (NF; monoclonal antibody, diluted
1:100; Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark); the astrocyte
marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:400; Chemicon); VEGF (polyclonal antibody,
diluted 1:500; Millipore); brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF; polyclonal antibody, diluted 1:1,000; Millipore);
NOX-4 (polyclonal antibody, diluted 1:1,000, Abnova); and
b-actin (monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:400; Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), which was used as a control protein. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:750; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) and isolectin B4 (antibody, diluted
1:50; Sigma Aldrich), followed by streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488
(antibody, diluted 1:1,000; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). All

slides were mounted with H-1200 Vectashield mounting
medium for fluorescence with diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Vector, Atom, Alicante, Spain). The samples were
examined with a TCS SPE spectral confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany), and the confocal images
were analyzed in Leica software LAS AF, version 2.0.1 build
2043. The images were acquired as a confocal maximum projection. For the analysis of blood vessel numbers and caliber,
mean fluorescence intensity was evaluated as an indirect measure of the number of blood vessels. A horizontal line and a
representative longitudinal profile of pixel intensity for each of
the groups are given (see Fig. 4). The researchers responsible
for the functional evaluation and biochemical and histological
studies were blinded to the treatment groups.
Statistical Analysis
The quantitative data are shown as mean 6 SD. A
Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, followed by a MannWhitney U test to compare the functional evaluation score;
lesion size; cell death; and NOX-4, GFAP, VEGF, and BDNF
levels among the animal groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant at a 95% confidence interval. SPSS 16 (IBM, Armok,
NY) and GraphPad 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software,
LaJolla, CA) were used for the statistical analyzes.

RESULTS
Functional Recovery
The animals were evaluated at 72 hr, 7 days, and 14
days after pMCAO with the Rogers and rotarod tests.
The functional score obtained for each group is shown in
Figure 2. The sham group showed no functional deficits
in either test.
In the Rogers test (Fig. 2, left), the mean scores
increased significantly 72 hr after pMCAO. However, 14
days after pMCAO, the treated groups showed good
functional recovery regardless of OLM administration.
Thus, the mean scores in the Rogers test improved significantly in the MCAO–/OLM (1.15 6 0.94), MCAOOLM/–
(0.5 6 0.70), and MCAOOLM/OLM (1.45 6 0.61) groups
compared with the control (2.23 6 0.52, P < 0.05) group.
In the rotarod test (Fig. 2, right), the basal mean
performance for all subjects was 120 sec. During the treatment period, the improvement was progressive for the
animals in the MCAO–/OLM (87.08 6 38.65) and the
MCAOOLM/– (105.5 6 20.5) groups compared with
the control (66.5 6 17.18, P < 0.05) group. However,
no significant improvement was observed in the
MCAOOLM/OLM (71.09 6 27.82) group compared with
the control or the MCAO–/OLM groups.
Lesion Size
Lesion size was evaluated by MRI (at 48 hr and 14
days) and H&E (at 14 days) after pMCAO (Fig. 3). The
MRI revealed that all groups had similar percentages of
infarction size at 48 hr. All the values were lower at 14
days than at 48 hr as a result of edema, which appeared in
the first few days after symptom onset. However, the

percentages of lesion size 14 days after pMCAO were significantly decreased in the MCAO–/OLM (11.09 6 3.86),
MCAOOLM/– (9.16 6 1.05), and pMCAOOLM/OLM
(8.63 6 3.33) groups compared with the rats in the
control (17.56 6 4.72, P < 0.05) group.
Similar results were obtained with H&E staining at
14 days after pMCAO. A statistically significant reduction
in lesion size was observed in the MCAO–/OLM
(7.20 6 3.92, P < 0.05), MCAOOLM/– (9.41 6 1.04), and
MCAOOLM/OLM (10.11 6 3.90, P < 0.05) groups
compared with the control (17.26 6 6.60) group.
Cell Death and Oxidative Stress Marker Levels
Cell death was assayed with TUNEL staining. The
sham-treated animals showed no TUNEL-positive cells,
and none of the treated animals showed TUNEL-positive
cells in the contralateral hemisphere (data not shown). The
control group (60.64 6 13.76) showed significantly more
TUNEL-positive cells compared with the MCAO–/OLM
(33.38 6 11.06), MCAOOLM/OLM (28.55 6 9.80), and
MCAOOLM/– (29.50 6 2.12) groups in the peri-infarct
zone 14 days after pMCAO (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A).
Fourteen days after pMCAO, NOX-4 expression was
observed in the peri-infarct zone in all groups. Quantitative
analysis showed significantly reduced levels of this oxidative
stress marker in the MCAOOLM/OLM (0.19 6 0.07) group
compared with the MCAO–/OLM (0.31 6 0.08, P < 0.05),
MCAOOLM/– (0.50 6 0.05), control (0.45 6 0.21), and
sham (0.18 6 0.05, P < 0.05) groups. We also observed
significantly reduced levels in the MCAO–/OLM group
compared with the MCAOOLM/– group (Fig. 4B).
Brain Repair-Associated Marker Levels in
the Peri-Infarct Zone
Fourteen days after pMCAO, positive labeling was
observed with the following markers in the peri-infarct
zone: isolectin B4 (Fig. 4C), GFAP, NeuN, VEGF, NF,
and BDNF (Fig. 4D). The GFAP levels were lower in
the sham (0.59 6 0.23), MCAOOLM/OLM (0.70 6 0.31),
and MCAOOLM/– (0.68 6 0.06) groups compared with
the control (1.05 6 0.37) and MCAO–/OLM (1.01 6 0.39)
groups (P > 0.05); however, these differences were not
statistically significant. Significantly higher VEGF levels
were observed in the control (0.76 6 0.30), MCAOOLM/–
(0.65 6 0.16), and MCAO–/OLM (0.73 6 0.43) groups
compared with the MCAOOLM/OLM (0.36 6 0.17) and
sham (0.30 6 0.12, P < 0.05) groups. By using isolectin
B4 staining, however, we observed greater numbers and a
larger caliber of blood vessels in the peri-infarct zone in
the MCAOOLM/OLM group compared with the other
groups. The mean fluorescence intensity for lectin was
calculated in the peri-infarct zone. The results showed
higher mean intensity in the MCAOOLM/OLM (45.71 6
6.43) group compared with the control (4.46 6 0.55),
MCAO–/OLM (5.10 6 1.99), and MCAOOLM/– (4.83 6
1.23; Fig. 4C) groups. The BDNF levels were significantly
lower in the sham (0.21 6 0.10) and MCAOOLM/OLM
(0.27 6 0.15) groups compared with the control

(0.56 6 0.17, P < 0.05), MCAOOLM/– (0.61 6 0.16), and
MCAO–/OLM (0.51 6 0.19, P < 0.05) groups.
DISCUSSION
This study analyzes the effects of various OLM treatment
regimens on pMCAO. All the treatment groups demonstrated improved functional recovery and decreased lesion
size and cell death compared with the control group.
However, we observed specific changes in the
MCAOOLM/OLM group, including reduced levels of oxygen sensor NOX-4 and the brain repair-associated
markers GFAP, VEGF, and BDNF in the peri-infarct
area compared with the MCAO–/OLM, MCAOOLM/–,
and control groups 14 days after pMCAO.
The specific response observed in the MCAOOLM/
OLM
group could represent a degree of ischemic tolerance
achieved after continuous pretreatment with OLM,
which could limit the brain repair response demand after
permanent cerebral ischemia. These results raise new,
clinically relevant questions, given that it is unclear
whether the administration of antihypertensive drugs
should be continued for acute stroke patients (Robinson
et al., 2010). Temporarily discontinuing or reducing premorbid antihypertensive medication has been proposed;
however, the onset of acute ischemic stroke and the optimal time for reinstating antihypertensive therapy has not
been established (Jauch et al., 2013). Thus, discontinuing
the use of ARBs in patients with acute stroke could
exacerbate the poststroke oxidative response and worsen
outcomes in terms of impairment.
Various OLM Treatment Regimens for Improving
Functional Recovery and Reducing Lesion Size in
the pMCAO Model
We observed significant improvements in the functional recovery of the animals treated with OLM, which
was particularly evident 14 days after pMCAO. In agreement with the current results, improvements have been
observed in behavioral tests (Guan et al., 2011a), body
proprioception and vibrissal touch (Lou et al., 2004), and
neurological outcome (Groth et al., 2003) after AT1
receptor antagonist treatments.
The MRI scans conducted in the current study
showed a significant reduction in cerebral infarct size at
14 days in all the treated groups compared with the control group. This result was further confirmed with the
H&E technique. These results are in agreement with previous data showing reduced infarct size in animals treated
with ARBs after cerebral ischemia (Engelhorn et al.,
2004; Hosomi et al., 2005; Hamai et al., 2006; Oyama
et al., 2010; Omote et al., 2014).
Effect of OLM on Cell Death and Levels of
Cerebral Protective and Repair-Associated
Markers
The possible mechanisms of brain injury by angiotensin II include the production of reactive oxygen species,
resulting in brain damage and cell apoptosis (Chrysant,

812

Gutierrez-Fernandez et al.

2012). In the current study, the cerebral tissues were better
preserved in all the OLM-treated animals, and there were
significantly reduced numbers of TUNEL-positive cells 14
days after pMCAO compared with the control group. This
result is in line with previous studies in which long-term
blockage of AT1 receptors in the brain inhibits apoptosis in
the boundary zone of the infarct core (Lou et al., 2004;
Takizawa et al., 2009).
Various markers are altered in the brain in response
to oxidative stress. A recent study demonstrated that
OLM provided greater benefits than a simple lowering of
blood pressure by its ability to reduce oxidative stresses
with neurovascular protection (Omote et al., 2014).
A previous study on mice demonstrated that temporary
pretreatment with valsartan attenuated brain damage and
decreased oxidative stress (Li et al., 2008). High levels of
oxygen sensor NOX-4 after stroke have been associated
in the literature with oxidative stress, and its pharmacological inhibition after ischemia has been shown to reduce
mortality and prevent damage (Kleinschnitz et al., 2010).
The blockade of AT1 receptors could also decrease the
stimulation of superoxide and peroxynitrite production
by angiotensin II in blood vessels (Nishimura et al.,
2000). The current study found diminished NOX-4
levels in the MCAOOLM/OLM group compared with the
MCAO–/OLM, MCAOOLM/–, and control groups. The
NOX-4 levels found in the MCAOOLM/OLM group were
similar to those observed in the sham group. These results
are clinically relevant considering that prestroke treatment
with ARBs should probably not be interrupted. The
capacity for vasodilatation in areas receiving collateral
circulation could therefore be better preserved. By using
isolectin B4 staining, we found greater numbers and a
larger caliber of blood vessels in the MCAOOLM/OLM
group, suggesting that the tissues were better preserved in
this group.
Brain repair mechanisms are activated at the onset of
cerebral ischemia (Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2012;
Ramos-Cejudo et al., 2012); however, very little information is available on brain repair-associated marker levels
after ARB administration. To analyze these mechanisms
in more detail, we measured brain levels of GFAP,
VEGF, and BDNF 14 days after pMCAO.
GFAP, a brain marker typically associated with glial
scar formation after cerebral ischemia (Yasuda et al.,
2004), was observed to be reduced in the peri-infarct area
14 days after stroke in the MCAOOLM/OLM and
MCAOOLM/– groups; however, the magnitude of this
reduction did not achieve statistical significance. These
GFAP levels showed a trend similar to that observed in
the sham group. We hypothesize that administration of
OLM in the drinking water for 7 days before pMCAO
could better preserve the tissue, resulting in less glial scar
formation in the peri-infarct zone in these animals. However, we observed no decreased levels of this marker in
the MCAO–/OLM group. Recent studies have suggested
that reactive astrocytes provide essential metabolic support
to neurons during cerebral ischemia (Sofroniew and
Vinters, 2010).

VEGF is a well-known growth factor and an important signaling molecule involved in vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis (Millauer et al., 1993; Dvorak, 2006). Several
studies have shown that VEGF levels are increased following
cerebral ischemia (Sun et al., 2003). In the current study, no
significant differences were observed in VEGF levels 14 days
after pMCAO among the MCAO–/OLM, MCAOOLM/–,
and control groups. This result is in line with other studies
in which candesartan administration was not observed to
increase VEGF levels after pMCAO (Guan et al., 2011a).
The failure to induce the formation of trophic factors, as
seen in reperfused animals (Kozak et al., 2009), could
explain the lack of benefit observed after pMCAO. In the
current study, at 14 days after pMCAO, decreased levels of
this marker were also observed in the peri-infarct zones of
the MCAOOLM/OLM group (similar to the levels found in
the sham group) compared with the other groups.
Finally, BDNF levels in the peri-infarct zone were
analyzed. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family,
which has been reported to have angiogenic effects and
plays an important role in recovery after stroke (Alhusban
et al., 2013). Krikov et al. (2008) showed that pretreatment with candesartan did not modify BDNF levels 48 hr
after transient MCAO compared with the vehicle group.
However, in the current study, a reduction in the levels
of this marker was observed 14 days after pMCAO in the
MCAOOLM/OLM group (to levels similar to those found
in the sham group) compared with the other groups.
These data could also indicate that the cerebral tissue in
the MCAOOLM/OLM-group animals might be better prepared to respond to ischemia, and brain repair mechanism
activation would be not necessary.
Not only were brain repair marker levels lower in
the MCAOOLM/OLM group, but we also observed a
reduction in NOX-4 levels and in the number of
TUNEL-positive cells along with greater numbers and a
larger caliber of blood vessels. Thus, we hypothesize that
the cerebral tissue in these animals might be better prepared to respond to ischemia-derived oxidative stress
caused by pMCAO.
In conclusion, the findings of the current study suggest that a degree of ischemic tolerance is achieved after
continuous OLM administration, showing reduced levels
of NOX-4, VEGF, BDNF, and GFAP and reduced brain
repair response demand at 14 days after pMCAO. The
question with regard to whether continuous administration of ARBs before and after stroke exerts a protective
role in the brain against cerebral ischemia warrants further
research, and its withdrawal in patients under treatment
with ARBs after stroke should be questioned.
