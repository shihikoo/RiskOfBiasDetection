Abstract
Background: The relationship between circulating microRNA-223 and pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke is
unknown. Here we investigated the roles and possible targets of circulating microRNA-223 in human ischemic
stroke within the first 72 hours.
Methods: Blood samples were collected from patients within 72 hours after cerebral ischemia (n = 79) and
compared with healthy control samples (n = 75). The level of possible downstream factors of microRNA-223 including
insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and interleukin-6 was examined by ELISA assay. The
relationship between the microRNA-223 level and NIHSS scores, TOAST subtypes, and infarct volume was analyzed
respectively. In addition, twelve adult male CD-1 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion using the suture
technique. Circulating blood and brain tissue in the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere were collected at 24 hours after
middle cerebral artery occlusion. microRNA-223 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reactions.
Results: microRNA-223 levels in the circulating blood of acute ischemic stroke patients were greatly increased
compared to the control (p < 0.05). microRNA-223, which were negatively correlated with NIHSS scores (r = −0.531,
p < 0.01) and infarct volume (r = −0.265, p = 0.039), was significantly up-regulated in large artery and small artery
strokes. The plasma level of insulin-like growth factor-1 was positively associated with that of microRNA-223 (r = 0.205,
p = 0.022). Moreover, microRNA-223 in blood and brain were positively correlated (r = 0.834, p < 0.05), and they were
up-regulated significantly in mice that underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that microRNA-223 is associated with acute ischemic stroke and possibly plays a role
in stroke through up-regulating growth factor such as insulin-like growth factor-1 gene.

Great attention has been paid to miR-223 because it can
regulate cell cycle, tumor invasiveness, haematopoietic
differentiation and immune cell function [13]. miR-223 is
located in the X chromosome. Some known transcriptional factors including NFI-A and C/EBPα regulate miR223 expression [14]. Studies demonstrated that miR-223 is

role in granulopoiesis [15]. miR-223 overexpression downregulates interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β expression in
TLR-activated macrophages [16]. During differentiation or
tumor progression, miR-223 suppresses cell proliferation by
targeting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) [17].
In hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, miR-223 is greatly
up-regulated and positively correlates with serum markers
of ischemic injury [18]. In the central nervous system miR223 is also highly present and is neuroprotective by targeting
GluR2 and NR2B subunits of the glutamate receptor [19].
However, the function of miR-223 associated with
acute ischemic brain injury (less than 72 hours) remains
unknown. The changes of miR-223 levels for stroke
diagnosis and their relationship with clinical confound
factors need to be explored. Here, we analyzed changes
of miR-223 levels in acute ischemic stroke patients and
animal ischemia model. We then assessed the relationship between the alteration of circulating miR-223 levels
and the NIHSS scores, subtypes and infarct volume of
acute stroke patients. To explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-223 in the ischemic pathological process, we
also studied the down-stream insulin-like growth factor1 (IGF-1), IGF1R and IL-6 changes in stroke patients.

Methods
Study subject

Subjects were enrolled in the study from July 2012 to
January 2013 and were approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
and gave informed consent. The control group included
subjects whose age and gender matched that of the stroke
patients. Demographic changes, associated laboratory
inspection, imaging information, which included blood
pressure, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride,
CT, MRI, MR angiography, carotid artery ultrasonography and cardiac ultrasonography were also collected
to analyze. Whether subjects taking medicines including
antidiabets, hypotensor or platelet aggregation drugs
was also recorded. The exclusion criteria included
recurrent stroke, intracranial tumor, multiple trauma,
hematological system diseases, renal or liver failure,
acute infectious diseases and other diseases affecting
the hemogram. If the time from the onset of stroke
symptoms to blood sample collection was longer than
72 hours, the patient was excluded.
The severity of ischemic stroke was assessed by the
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [20].
The patients were classified into the following groups:
large-artery atherosclerosis (LA, n = 37), cardioembolism
(CE, n = 5), small artery stroke (SA, n = 9) and undetermined etiology (UN, n = 28) by the Trial of Org 10172
in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) [21]. The infarct
volumes were calculated by ABC/2 method [22]. The risk
factors were defined as following: hypertension: blood

pressure above 140/90 mmHg; hyperlipidemia: total cholesterol level ≥ 0.7 mmol/L, triglyceride level ≥ 1.8 mmol/L
and HDL level < 1 mmol/L; Diabetes mellitus: fastingblood glucose level > 6.1 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥ 7% [23].
Middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice

Procedures for the use of laboratory animals were approved by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, Shanghai, China. Adult
male CD-1 mice (n = 12) weighing 25–30 grams were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg,
Sigma, San Louis, MO). Body temperature was controlled
and maintained at 37 ± 0.3°C using a heating pad (RWD
Life Science, Shenzhen, China) during the anesthesia
period. After isolation of left common carotid artery
(CCA), external and internal carotid artery (ECA, ICA), a
silicone-coated 6–0 suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) was
gently inserted from the ECA stump to the ICA, and
stopped at the opening of the MCA. The distance from
the bifurcation of ICA/ECA to MCA was 10 ± 0.5 mm
[24]. Successful occlusion was verified by a laser Doppler
flowmeter (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK). Mice with
surface cerebral blood flow that was more than 15% of
baseline were excluded from the experiment. Shamoperated mice underwent the same surgery procedure
except inserting the suture into the ICA.
Preparation of blood and brain samples

A 4 ml blood sample from acute ischemic stroke patients was collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and centrifuged at 1500 g for 10
minutes at room temperature. Then the erythrocytes
were dissociated with erythrocyte lysing solution and
discarded, the remaining leucocytes were held for total
RNA extraction.
The brains of mice were rapidly removed and cut into
four coronal sections 2 mm apart. The second slice was
divided into ischemic ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. The ischemic ipsilateral brain tissue and blood
collected for total RNA extraction using TRIzol and
TRIzol LS reagent respectively (Invitrogen, Carlsbad).
Reverse transcription and Real-time PCR

RNA concentration and purity were detected by the
NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo, Wilmington,
DE). The samples of absorbance at 260–280 nm between
1.8 and 2.0 were adopted. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 ng RNA using universal cDNA synthesis kit
(EXIQON, Vedbaek, Denmark). The amplification was
performed by a fast real-time PCR system (7900 HT,
ABI, Foster City, CA) using a SYBR Green master mix
(EXQION) following the cycling conditions: 95°C for
10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds,
and 60°C for 1 minute. miR-223 relative expression was

normalized to the endogenous control U6 expression in
triplicate and was calculated by the 2-Δct method.
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)

The levels of human plasma IGF-1, IGF1R and IL-6 were
measured by ELISA kits (Westang Bio-Tech, Shanghai,
China) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
intra- and inter-assay CV are less 10%.
Statistical analysis

The results were expressed as percentages for categorical
variables and as mean ± SD or median and range (25th
and 75th percentiles) for the continuous variables depending on whether their distribution was normal or
not. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for testing
the normality of the distribution. Proportions were compared using the chi-square test, while the continuous
variables between groups were compared with the Student’s t or the Mann–Whitney tests. Spearman’s analysis
was used for bivariate correlations depending on their
non-normal distribution. ANOVA should be used for
comparison among several quantitative variables. The
influence of miR-223 levels on a categorical variable was
assessed by logistic regression analysis using forward
stepwise selection procedures after adjusting for those
variables with a proven biological relevance for stoke
mobidity to avoid the possibility of finding some spurious associations. Results were expressed as adjusted
odds ratios (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). Significance was set at a probability
p < 0.05.

On admission, the ages of the stroke patients were
65.1 ± 10.0 years and the ages of the control group were
62.5 ± 6.3 years (p = 0.053). The number of males in
both groups was about double that of females (male/
female = 58/21 in ischemic group and male/female = 50/25
in control group, p = 0.383). To eliminate unmatched factor impaction (hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia)

on miR-223 expression levels between two groups, a logistic regression was performed. The results of logistic regression suggested that the level of blood miR-223 was a
stroke risk factor (p = 0.011, adjusted odd ratio = 1.002,
95% CI: 1.000-1.004).

miR-223 levels in the blood of acute ischemic patients
were elevated compared with the control subjects [Figure 1,
stroke vs. control, 141.57 (12.45, 715.12) vs. 40.64 (3.13,

1 day and 3 days groups following stroke occurrence

compared to the control [Figure 2A, 1 day vs. control,

patient with/without antidiabets, hypotensor or platelet
aggregation drugs was analyzed respectively. We did
not find the significant difference of the expression
levels of miR-223 (data not shown here).

and infarct volume (Figure 2D, r = −0.265, p = 0.039).
Brain and blood miR-223 in ischemic mice

miR-223 was significantly up-regulated in both brain and
blood samples compared to that of the sham in MCAO
mice (Figure 3A, brain, MCAO vs. sham, 0.06 ± 0.01 vs.

the blood miR-223 and the brain miR-223 levels was
analyzed by Spearman’s correlation analysis (Figure 3B,
r = 0.834, p < 0.05).
The correlation between miR-223 and potential target
genes

The levels of plasma IGF-1 and IGF1R were greatly increased in the stroke patients group compared to the
control group (Table 2). IGF-1 levels changed with miR223 levels in the 1 day, 2 days and 3 days groups after
ischemia (Figure 4A) and miR-223 expression was positively associated with IGF-1 levels (Figure 4C, r = 0.205,
p = 0.022). There was no significant correlation between

miR-223 expression and IGF1R (Figure 4B, r = −0.023,
p = 0.795) and IL-6 (Figure 4D, r = −0.058, p = 0.522).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that miR-223 was hyperexpressed in the circulating blood of acute ischemic
stroke patients. The severity of stroke and the infarct
volume of stroke patients were negatively associated
with miR-223 expression. miR-223 levels were greatly increased in patients with LA and SA stroke. The plasma
level of IGF-1 has a positive correlation to miR-223
level. Brain miR-223 and blood miR-223 level were significantly elevated and have a positive correlation in
MCAO mice.
Previous animals’ experiments demonstrated that miR223 level was significantly elevated at 24 and 72 hour reperfusion in rat transient MCAO [25] and at 3 and
24 hours in ischemic preconditioning [26]. Another
study of miR-223 expression proved that miR-223 was
greatly increased in the blood of young stroke patients
aged 18–49 years [23]. In our study, we found the similar changes of miR-223 expression in the blood of acute
ischemic stroke patients and that the brain miR-223
level positively correlated with blood miR-223 level in
ischemic mice. The result suggested that miR-223 is

involved in the process of ischemia and hypoxia and
implied that blood miR-223 represents the changes of
miR-223 in brain response to ischemic stroke.
Blood samples were obtained within 72 hours of stroke
onset and molecular studies have shown considerable variability in the acute period (Figure 2A). Maybe this is a relative broad time range for the expression of miR-223.
Besides, to obtain a temporal expression profile of miR-223
in patients, it is perfect for the extraction of basal samples
from the same patients at 24, 48 and 72 hours. This problem could be solved in further studies. In general, ischemic
stroke classified as LA, CE, SA and Undetermined according TOAST subtype classification. We classified inpatients
as LA, CE, SA and UN in our study group and found that
LA and UN are the main subtypes. This may be different
from other studies, we consider it may be caused by
the ethnic group. In the study, miR-223 expression of
the stroke patients with LA or SA showed similar upregulation. However, miR-223 showed opposite expression
patterns in LA or SA stroke within 6–18 months [23]. The
difference might be caused by the different blood sample
collection times. NIHSS scores indicate the severity of
ischemic stroke. The mean NIHSS in our studies is relative
low, suggesting miR-223 is sensitive for mild stroke.
Whether miR-223 associated with the severe stroke needs
to be further studied. NIHSS scores had a negative correlation with miR-223 expression in our study, implying the
potential neuroprotective role of miR-223 in stroke.
The therapeutic potential of IGF-1 for ischemic brain
injury had been proved [27,28]. In the study, IGF-1 level
changed with miR-223 levels in the 1 day, 2 days and
3 days groups after ischemia, suggesting the modulation
of miR-223 on IGF-1 expression. In vitro studies have
demonstrated that miR-223 could specifically regulate
IGF1R expression [17]. However, we did not find a similar correlation between miR-223 and IGF1R in the blood
of patients with acute ischemia. The reason for the
difference between in vitro and in vivo studies was
unclear. Increasing evidences suggest miR-223 plays a
vital role in modulating inflammatory reactions [15].
IL-6 could induce the decrease of miR-223 expression
after lipopolysaccharide stimulation in macrophages
[16]. But we did not find a correlation between miR223 and IL-6 levels in vivo. It was plausible to assume
that miR-223 takes part in the early inflammatory reaction after stoke through other pathways.
Stroke is a neurological emergency where time has an
extraordinary value for clinical or therapeutic decisions.
As a result, a useful biomarker for stroke should be
determined in a very short period of time. To develop a
novel technique quickly detect the changes of miR-223
will greatly help to the diagnosis of stroke. Moreover,
RNA stabilizing agent is better than EDTA tube, which
is modified in future study.

Conclusions
The study reported circulating miR-223 based markers
for acute ischemic stroke occurrence, subtypes and infarct
volume. Our findings suggested IGF-1 might be a new target of miR-223. Further studies with larger sample sizes
are needed to assess the clinical application of miR-223
signatures. We believe that miR-223 has great potential as
a novel therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
