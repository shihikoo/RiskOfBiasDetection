Aim: Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a member of connexin family mainly expressed in astrocytes, which forms gap junctions and hemichannels
and maintains the normal shape and function of astrocytes. In this study we investigated the role of Cx43 in astrocytes in facilitating
neuronal recovery during ischemic stroke.
Methods: Primary culture of astrocytes or a mixed culture of astrocytes and cortical neurons was subjected to oxygen glucose
deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R). The expression of Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes was detected using immunocytochemical
staining and Western blot assays. Intercellular Ca2+ concentration was determined with Fluo-4 AM fluorescent staining. Middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats were used for in vivo studies.
Results: OGD/R treatment of cultured astrocytes caused a decrement of Cx43 expression and translocation of Cx43 from cell
membrane to cytoplasm, accompanied by cell retraction. Furthermore, OGD/R increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, activated
CaMKII/CREB pathways and upregulated expression of Ephrin-A4 in the astrocytes. All these changes in OGD/R-treated astrocytes
were alleviated by overexpression of Cx43. In the cortical neurons cultured with astrocytes, OGD/R inhibited the neurite growth,
whereas overexpression of Cx43 or knockdown of Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes restored the neurite growth. In MCAO model rats, neuronal
recovery was found to be correlated with the recuperation of Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes.
Conclusion: Cx43 can stabilize astrocytes and facilitate the resistance to the deleterious effects of a stroke-like milieu and promote
neuronal recovery.

Introduction

Stroke is a hazardous cerebrovascular event with a high
incidence rate. Ischemic stroke causes a rapid loss of brain
function as a result of a disruption of the blood supply to the
brain and has a higher incidence than hemorrhagic stroke.
Currently, medication for strokes mainly focuses on neurons,
and the glia and neuron-glia interactions are neglected, which
could compromise the therapeutic effects of the treatment[1].
To discover novel targets, researchers have shifted to considering other non-neuronal cells and elucidating how they function in stroke progression.
Astrocytes are among these non-neuronal cells and
are predominant in the central nervous system. After
activation by a stroke and the related milieu, astrocytes are
hostile to neuronal recovery. Primarily, astrocytes amplify

neuroinflammation by secreting various types of cytokines and
chemokines[2]. In addition, astrocytes can proliferate and form
glial scars, which impedes the growth of neurons. The glial
scar embodies the extracellular matrix and includes a plethora
of components, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans,
Sema3A, fibronectin, and collagen[3, 4]. Among them, EphA4
has not been exculpated from inhibiting neuronal recovery.
Evidence has shown that EphA4, expressed both in astrocytes
and neurons, is detrimental to the growth of neurons. The
binding of ligands (ie, Ephrin-A1, Ephrin-A3, Ephrin-A4,
Ephrin-A5) is the premise for the inhibitory effect of EphA4.
Moreover, it was found that Ephrin-A4 inhibited neurite
growth in the peripheral nervous system[5].
Inhibiting and reversing the activation of astrocytes appears
to be rational and practical. However, the complete progression of a stroke and neuronal recovery are extremely complicated. Specifically, inhibiting inflammation-related signaling
pathways, which also exert essential functions in normal cells,
to deactivate astrocytes is uneven. Therefore, it may be expe-

dient to stabilize astrocytes or appropriately return them to a
normal state.
The functions of Cx43 in astrocytes should not be neglected
in brain development, ischemia, neurodegenerative disease
and brain injury. Astrocyte-restricted disruption of Cx43
could dampen neuronal plasticity in the barrel cortices of
mice[6]. It has been reported that Cx43 could be protective
by releasing ATP. Moreover, the inflammatory milieu could
cause the opposite regulation of gap junctions and hemichannels[7–9], which are two types of functional units composed of
Cx43. Functionally increased hemichannels by hypoxia or proinflammatory factors can mediate the release of deleterious
substances that could impair glial and neuronal survival[7, 10].
While functional decrements in gap junctions disturb cell-cell
communication and could disarm the buffering reservoir of
astrocyte networks, rectifying the function of gap junctions
might improve the rate of neuronal death[11]. Both glia and
neurons could benefit from bone marrow stromal cells and
human marrow stromal cells based on the recovery of Cx43 as
well as the functional units composed of Cx43[12, 13]. Therefore,
Cx43 could possibly be a basis or even a potential target for
neuroprotection during ischemia or brain injury. Herein we
utilized oxygen glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) and
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to simulate ischemic
stroke. It was found that Cx43 was significant for the integrity
and stability of astrocytes. Ameliorating alterations of Cx43
could promote cell integrity and the stability of astrocytes
treated with OGD/R, and the growth of cortical neurons could
be sustained.

Materials and methods

Animals
All the male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were provided by
SLAC Laboratory Animals Co Ltd (Shanghai, China). The
use of animals and experimental procedures were performed
following the rules of the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.
Primary culture of astrocytes and cortical neurons
A purified primary culture of astrocytes was derived from SD
rats at postnatal d 1 (P0). After anaesthetization with an ice
bath, rat pups were soaked in 75% ethanol, and their brains
were dissected into separate cortices. Then, the separated
cortices were minced and digested with 0.125% trypsin. The
cell suspensions were grown in 75 cm2 culturing flasks precoated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, CAT# P0899) at a density
of approximately 2×106 cells/mL. The cells were cultured in
high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’smedium(DMEM,
Gibco, CAT# 12800-017) with 10% horse serum (Gibco, CAT#
16050-122) in an incubator (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) with 5% CO2 and 95% humid air at 37 °C. After
seven days, the culture flasks were shaken in a rotatory shaker
at 200 rounds/min for 8 h to remove neurons and oligodendrocytes. The remaining adhered cells were eliminated by
cytosine arabinoside (final concentration 10 μmol/L) treatment. The purity of the astrocytes in the cultures was more

than 98%, which was verified by immunocytochemistry staining utilizing anti-GFAP antibodies (Millipore, MAB360, 1:300).
SD rat fetuses (E17) were utilized to obtain a primary culture
of cortical neurons. Pregnant rats were anaesthetized with
chloral hydrate at a dosage of 35 mg/100 g. Then, dissection
was performed to collect the fetuses in uteruses. The collected fetuses were soaked in 4 °C pre-cold D-Hanks solution
followed by the separation of brains and cortices under a stereoscopic microscope. The cortices were minced and digested
with 0.125% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. After the digestion
was terminated by DMEM with 10% FBS, cortices were suspended with a Pasteur pipette. Suspensions were collected to
obtain cells via centrifugation. The cells were transfected with
DsRed plasmids via an AMAXA Nucleofector kit. Then, they
were plated at densities of 104/mL onto the astrocyte (with or
without OGD/R treatment) culture.
OGD/R of astrocytes
First, the astrocyte primary culture medium was changed with
DMEM without glucose and serum. The treatment of OGD
was performed in a specially fabricated plexiglass chamber
filled with a mixture of 95% N2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 6 h
of OGD, astrocytes were cultured in high glucose DMEM with
10% FBS in an incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% humid air at
37 °C, which simulated reperfusion of an ischemic stroke.
MCAO
Experimental procedures were basically consistent with methods reported earlier[14, 15]. Briefly, male SD rats that weighed
250–280 g were anesthetized with 45 mg/kg pentobarbital
sodium. The left external carotid artery (ECA) was separated
and ligated proximally to create a cross of Y-shaped carotid
arteries. Nylon sutures were inserted into the internal carotid
artery (ICA) via the common carotid artery (CCA) and fixed
by a cotton suture tied around the ICA when the CCA was
ligated distally in advance to block the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). Then, the incision was sutured. The inserted nylon
suture was pulled out after 1 h of ischemia to initiate reperfusion. The animals were euthanized at d 1 or d 8 after perfusion.
Overexpression of Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 RNAi
The construction of the plasmids for Cx43 overexpression
were based on the pcDNA 3.0 vector. The rat mRNA pool,
which was extracted from rat astrocyte primary cultures, was
utilized to amplify sequences for Cx43 expression. Then,
the fragments were inserted into the pcDNA 3.0 vector. The
sequence-verified vector for Cx43 overexpression was transfected into astrocytes via an AMAXA Nucleofector kit (Lonza,
CAT# VPG-1003, VPG-1006) following the protocols provided
by the manufacturers.
Cx43 RNAi plasmids and Ephrin-A4 RNAi plasmids
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CAT# sc60008-SH) and Thermo Open Biosystems (CAT# RHS4531).
Both of these RNAi plasmids were transfected into astrocytes

vided by the manufacturers.
Protein extraction and Western blot
The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mmol/L,
pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, Na-deoxycholate
0.25%, NP-40 1%, PMSF 1 mmol/L, Na3VO4 1 mmol/L, NaF 1
mmol/L, aprotinin 10 mg/mL, leupeptin 5 mg/mL, pepstatin
5 mg/mL) for whole cell protein extraction. The separation
of the membrane protein, cytoplasmic protein and nuclear
protein was executed with a plasma-membrane protein extraction kit (Beyotime, CAT# P0033) and plasma-nucleus protein
extraction kit (Beyotime, CAT# P0027) according to the protocols of the manufacturer.
Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CAT# 23227) based on the
protocols of the manufacturer. Then, protein samples were
loaded and ran on 10% or 12% denatured polyacrylamide gels.
After protein samples of a certain molecular weight were separated via electrophoresis, the samples that remained on the
gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (0.25 or 0.45 μm,
Millipore) usingthe Bio-Rad wet transfer system. Blocking of
non-specific protein binding sites in the PVDF membrane for
1 h at room temperature was performed with 5% non-fat milk
powder and 5% goat serum dissolved in PBS. Then, primary
antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer overnight after
the antibodies were diluted: rabbit anti-Connexin 43 (CST,
CAT# 3512, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Ephrin-A4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CAT# sc914, 1:300), rabbit anti-CREB (CST, CAT#
4820, 1:1000), mouse anti-TFIIB (CST, CAT# 4169, 1:1000),
and rabbit anti-β-Actin (Abmart, CAT# P30002, 1:1500). The
PVDF membranes with protein samples were incubated with
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated
secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature after the
primary antibodies were washed with TBST buffer. An ECL
kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, CAT# 34080) was subsequently
utilized to detect the samples.
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry staining
The cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde and perforated with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then washed
with PBS for three times, and the perforated samples were
blocked with PBS/5% goat or donkey serum/5% BSA for 1
h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was
performed at 2–8 °C overnight and was then followed by secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG CAT#
A21428, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG CAT# A11008,
Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-Mouse IgG CAT# A21422) incubation after being washed by PBS three times. Finally, the
samples were mounted on glass slides with DAKO mounting
reagent (CAT# S3023).
Wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor488 (Invitrogen, CAT#
W11261) was added into the cell cultures at a concentration of
5.0 μg/mL, and this incubation was maintained for 5 min if
the cell membrane was to be stained. Then, fixation with 4%
polyformaldehyde was performed.
Brain tissues were dehydrated with 30% sucrose solution
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

after being fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and then, brain
slices were obtained via frozen section with a Leica freezing
microtome. The perforation, blocking and antibody incubations were performed identically for each treatment of the cell
samples.
The cell nuclei were stained with 4’,6-diamidine-2’-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Roche Diagnostics, CAT#
10236276001) at a concentration of 100 ng/mL.
Dilution of the antibodies was performed for rabbit antiConnexin 43(CST, 1:100), mouse anti-GFAP (Millipore, 1:300),
mouse anti-β-TubulinIII (CST, CAT# 5666), rabbit anti-EphrinA4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:25), rabbit anti-EphA4
(Abcam, CAT# ab5396, 1:100), mouse anti-NSE (Millipore,
CAT# MAB314, 1:10), and Alexa fluorescent dye-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:300).
Confocal microscopy
All the fluorescent staining samples were imaged with an
Olympus FV 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. The
Cx43 distributions in astrocytes and the cortical neurons cultured with astrocytes were observed with a 40×0.95 numerical
aperture objective lens. The brain slices was observed with a
10×0.4 and 20×0.75 objective lens.
Determination of intracellular calcium concentrations
Primary cultures of astrocytes were plated in 96-well plates.
After 48 h, the cultures of astrocytes were treated with OGD/R
and then washed with D-Hanks buffer. Fluo-4 AM (5 μmol/L,
with 1% pluronic F-127) loading proceeded in D-Hanks (30
min, 37 °C). After washing with D-Hanks, the fluorescent
astrocytes were detected (λex=485 nm, λem=520 nm) with a
NOVO star cell-based fast kinetic microplate reader (BMG,
Germany). The relative concentration of cytoplasmic calcium
was calculated as [Ca2+]r (F–Fmin)/(Fmax–F) (Fmax: fluorescent
intensity after the cells were perforated with 1% Triton X-100;
Fmin: fluorescent intensity after calcium was chelated with 10
mmol/L EDTA.)
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
All the procedures followed the protocol in the manual from
the Abcam ChIP kit (Abcam, CAT# ab500). Briefly, the nuclear
content of the astrocytes was extracted, and the chromatin was
sonicated into fragments. Chromatin fragments bound with
CREB were pulled down by CREB antibodies. After the decrosslinking between DNA fragments of chromatin and CREB,
the amount of fragments pulled down by CREB antibodies
were detected with semi-quantitative PCR.
The following primer sequences were used: forward
5’-ATGCGGCTGTTGCCCCTGCTGCGGACTGTG-3’ and
reverse 5’-GTTAGTGGAGTTCCAGTAGATAGAGTGGCG-3’.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
CAT# USA15596018) and then precipitated with isopropanol.
The reverse transcription and real-time PCR kits were purchased from TAKARA. Real-time PCR were carried out with

Results

Cx43 in astrocytes underwent dynamic variation during OGD/R
Cx43 is necessary for maintaining the normal function of astro-

cytes by being anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. Cx43
in astrocytes was mainly distributed in the plasma membrane,
particularly adjacent to two cells (Figure 1A). While in the
cytoplasm, Cx43 was also located in cellular organelles (which
might be the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum for
the synthesis of lysosomes for regular degradation) around the
nucleus. We utilized OGD/R to simulate hypoxia and nutritional deficiency generated by an ischemic stroke. Purified
astrocytes were treated with OGD for 6 h and then reperfused.
It was found that the adhesion between two adjacent cells was
damaged, and the cells were retracted (Figure 1B and 1E). The
total protein of Cx43 was also reduced after OGD/R (Figure
1C and 1D). The Cx43 located in the plasma membrane was
distributed in the cytoplasm and accompanied by cell retraction during OGD/R (Figure 1B and 1E). We found that Cx43
was translocated from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm at
the beginning of recovery after OGD. We separated the cytoplasm and membrane protein fractions of the astrocytes and

then performed a Western blot assay with the anti-Cx43 antibody. The results showed that the protein level of the Cx43
membrane fraction was decreased after OGD. The cytoplasm
fraction increased, although the restoration of membraneanchored Cx43 also progressed (Figure 1F and 1G). Moreover,
during the recovery, the recovery of adhesion astrocytes was
correlated with the restoration of Cx43 anchored in the cell
membrane. Overexpressed Cx43 in astrocytes could alleviate
the retraction caused by OGD. It could be observed that Cx43
was still anchored in the plasma membrane where two cells
were adjoined (Figure 2A and 2B). This indicated that Cx43

may play a role in sustaining cell-cell adhesion in OGD/R.
The upregulated expression of Ephrin-A4 caused by OGD/R
It is well known that astrocytes are activated after brain injury,
such as ischemic stroke. The astrocytes amplify neuroinflammation by secreting various types of cytokines and chemokines. Meanwhile, they can proliferate to form glial scars.
The glial scar embodies the extracellular matrix and includes
a plethora of components to impede the growth of neurons,
such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Sema3A, fibronectin, and collagen[3, 4]. Next, we wanted to know whether the

could attenuate the cell retraction caused by OGD. The results of phase contrast (A) and confocal microscopy (B); OGD/R incurred degradation of Cx43
brought about the upregulation of Ephrin-A4 (C–E); shRNA plasmid targeting Cx43 could efficiently knockdown the Cx43 protein level (F); the knockdown
of Cx43 could also upregulate Ephrin-A4 expression levels (G, H). Scale bar: A=10 μm, B=10 μm. n=4. cP<0.01 compared with the control. fP<0.01

decrease in Cx43 after OGD/R had any effect on Ephrin-A4.
We investigated the changes in Ephrin-A4 on astrocytes after
OGD/R. First, we detected the expression of Ephrin-A4 with
a Western blot assay. The results showed that the expression
of Ephrin-A4 was upregulated after OGD/R (Figure 2C). We
found that the upregulation of Ephrin-A4 was consistent with
the downregulation of Cx43 (Figure 2D and 2E). To confirm
these results, we knocked down the expression of Cx43 in
astrocytes with RNAi, and the results of a Western blot assay
showed that the expression of Ephrin-A4 was also significantly increased after OGD/R (Figure 2F, 2G, and 2H).
The upregulated expression of Ephrin-A4 was mediated through
the CaMKII/CREB pathway
Many studies have revealed that various physiological and
pathological activities of astrocytes were closely associated
with calcium. As glial cells are predominant in the central
nervous system, astrocytes function as colossal calcium reservoirs[16]. Numerous factors (agonists of Gq GPCR, ATP,
and mechanical stumili) could trigger a calcium influx[17–19].
The pathological extracellular concentration of potassium
induces the uptake of calcium into the astrocytes, and to some
extent, the extracellular calcium could be scavenged to alleviate the possibility of neuronal calcium overloading[20, 21]. On
all counts, the astrocytes contributed to the homeostasis of
calcium. Transmission of calcium waves is a direct way for

astrocytes to convey information[22, 23]. The functional syncytium based on gap junctions between astrocytes allows the
transmission of excitation with rapidity and efficiency.
To determine the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms for the increase in Ephrin-A4, we postulated that
after treatment with OGD/R, the dislocation and following
degradation of Cx43 in astrocytes could possibly disturb the
homeostasis of intracellular calcium and subsequently initiate
the calcium-related signaling pathway for the translation of
Ephrin-A4. Then, we assessed the concentration of the intercellular calcium with fluo-4 AM loading. The results showed
that intercellular calcium was significantly increased after
OGD/R (Figure 3A). Overexpression of Cx43 could attenuate
upregulation of the calcium concentration induced by OGD/R.
Knockdown of Cx43 expression with RNAi increased the
concentration of calcium in astrocytes (Figure 3A). EGTA is
a calcium chelator, and by using EGTA to chelate the calcium
in the culture system, the increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations and the upregulation of Ephrin-A4 after OGD/R
was alleviated (Figure 3B and 3C), indicating the significance
of calcium overloading for the upregulation of Ephrin-A4. It
was reported that the expression of Ephrin-A4 was more likely
mediated by the CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway[24]. Then,
we determined the translocation of CREB into the nucleus. We
found that the translocation of CREB was obviously increased
in astrocytes after OGD/R. The administration of KN-93, an

inhibitor of CaMKII, could reverse the enhancement of CREB
nuclear translocation caused by OGD/R, indicating that the
incremental CREB in the nucleus was mainly mediated by the
activation of CaMKII (Figure 3D and 3E). Next, we detected
the amount of CREB binding the chromatin partition of the
DNA sequence of the gene encoding Ephrin-A4 via chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP). It showed that the amount of
Ephrin-A4 binding CREB was enhanced after treatment with
OGD/R (Figure 3F and 3G). Overexpression of Cx43 abated
the increased CREB in the nucleus and lessened the binding
of CREB by DNA sequencing the gene encoding Ephrin-A4 in
chromatin (Figure 3F and 3G), solidifying the role of Cx43 in
inhibiting the upregulation of Ephrin-A4 expression caused by
OGD/R.

The maintenance of Cx43 in the membranes of astrocytes was
indispensable to neuronal growth
It has been reported that Ephrin-A4 could inhibit neurite
growth in dorsal root ganglion cells[5]. For astrocytes, the activation of EphA4 leads to astrogliosis, but for neurons, it inhibits the growth of neurites[25]. We used neuron specific enolase
(NSE) to mark neurons. We confirmed that EphA4 (the receptor of Ephrin-A4) was expressed in the cortical neurons plated
on astrocytes (Figure 4A). Additionally, it was found that the
protein expression of Ephrin-A4 was upregulated after treatment with OGD/R, and shRNA plasmid targeting EphrinA4 could knockdown Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes treated with
OGD/R (Figure 4B). Numerous studies have revealed that
astrocytes could be activated[26–28], in which state they would

hamper neuronal recovery in stroke and neurodegenerative
disorders. To promote brain recovery from disorders such as
a stroke, the function of astrocytes should be restored. Cx43
plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of
the astrocyte membrane and astrocyte function. We analyzed the mechanism for this using a co-culture of astrocytes
and neurons. The primary culture of cortical neurons were
plated on astrocytes treated with or without OGD/R. The
length of neurites and branches spreading to neuronal areas
are illustrated. It was observed that the neurons cultured on
astrocytes with OGD/R had shortened total lengths of neurite
branches (TLNBs) and low advanced/primary branch (A/P)
ratios compared to the control groups (Figure 4C–4F). Because
maintaining a sufficient amount of Cx43 could ameliorate cell
retraction and stabilize astrocytes, we overexpressed Cx43 in
astrocytes. The results showed that the cortical neurons cultured with astrocytes treated with OGD/R were also rescued
by the overexpression of Cx43 and were prone to grow better
(Figure 4C–4F). According to these outcomes, it is rational to
postulate that the overexpression of Cx43 can attenuate the
upregulation of Ephin-A4 in astrocytes treated with OGD/R
and facilitate neuronal growth. Therefore, the maintenance of
Cx43 in the membranes of astrocytes was crucial to neuronal
growth.
Neuronal recovery correlated with the recuperation of Cx43 and
Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes
To investigate whether neuronal recovery was correlated with
the recuperation of Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes, we
utilized MCAO model rats. As a single side of MCAO could
generate an infarct in a certain brain area (Figure 5A), we
observed changes in Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes adjacent to the infarct area and during neuronal recovery. One
side of the model rat brain underwent ischemia for 1 h, and
then, the blood supply was recovered by reperfusion. After
24 h of reperfusion, the infarct area could be observed with an
obvious boundary by GFAP staining (Figure 5B). The astrocytes in the area adjacent to the infarct zone revealed a lack
of β-Tubulin III and GFAP staining compared to that of the
intact area far from the infarct zone. Moreover, the distribution of astrocytes was closer to the infarct area than that of
neurons. It seemed that astrocytes demarcated the zone for
neuronal growth (Figure 5B). However, GFAP and β-Tubulin
III staining could be observed in the contralateral area corresponding to the ipsilateral infarct area (Supplementary Figure
1A). After eight days of recovery, the neuronal staining was
located in the area that was supposed to be the infarct zone
but was still lacking astrocyte staining, indicating a disruption
in neuronal growth through the demarcation of astrocytes to
the infarct area (Figure 6A), while the distribution of neuronal and astroglial staining in the contralateral areas were still
similar to seven days before (Supplementary Figure 1B). Furthermore, the staining of Cx43 and Ephrin-A4 in astrocytes of
the area surrounding the infarct area had as much intensity as
astrocytes of the contralateral brain (Figures 6B and 6C). In
other words, neuronal growth was initiated when Cx43 and

Bederson’s neurological scoring scale was utilized to
evaluate the behavioral dysfunction caused by MCAO: 0=no

after the rat is suspended, 2=lowered repelling forces of the
contralateral limbs, 3=swirling to the damaged side after tail
hung, but during free ambulation, no observable swirling,
and 4=spontaneous swirling to the damaged side. It was
found that neurological scores after seven days of reperfusion were significantly lower than that of one day of reperfusion (2.40±0.24 vs 3.00±0.00, bP<0.05), indicating the recuperation of rats with MCAO treatment after seven days of
reperfusion. These results were consistent with the neuronal
recovery verified by immunofluorescent staining (Supplementary Figure 2).

Discussion

Astrocytes make up approximately 40%±50% of all glial cells
and play important roles in brain homeostasis. Cx43, which
is mainly expressed in the astrocytes of the CNS, is a member
of the connexin family, comprising two types of functional
units, gap junctions and hemichannels. The gap junction is
undoubtedly an important structure for astrocytes to maintain
brain homeostasis. Cx43 shows a strong ability to maintain
the normal shape and function of astrocytes. The dynamic
distribution of Cx43, consisting of the transport of Cx43 into
the cytoplasmic membrane and internalization of Cx43, takes
place by regular turnover[29] and in abnormal states of the
cells[30–32]. The alterations in the dynamic distribution of Cx43
in cells undergoing morbidity could be normal in certain roles.
Stroke or brain ischemia comprises miscellaneous factors that
could generate abnormal changes in Cx43. However, links are
still missing regarding the pathological factors and changes in
Cx43.
Our results showed that OGD/R could alter the location of
Cx43 in astrocytes and induce an increase in Ephrin-A4. The
latter is a nerve growth inhibitory factor. Interestingly, the
activation of EphA4 could also potentially trigger astrogliosis[33, 34]. To summarizethese outcomes, the dislocation and
degradation of Cx43, activation of EphA4 and astrogliosis
probably comprise a feed-forward cycle, which could be iniActa Pharmacologica Sinica

tiated by a stroke-like milieu with the dislocation of Cx43.
Then, the ongoing nature of this vicious cycle alters homeostasis in astrocytes and disturbs the balance of neuron-glia.
Therefore, ensuring sufficient Cx43 in the plasma membrane
could “extinguish the fire before it flares.” It is likely that
Cx43 could be a defender of or gate in the plasma membrane
of astrocytes. If they were dislocated or destroyed, astrocytes
would undergo what occurs in a stroke-like milieu.
Cx43 and its related functional units maintain cell integrity
and cell-cell communication, which would mediate the protective effect of astrocytes in hypoxic preconditioning[35]. A
milieu of neuroinflammation and metabolic inhibition could
disturb the aforementioned function of Cx43 in astrocytes
under normal conditions[36, 37]. We postulated that Cx43 could
maintain homeostasis in cells; thus, the degradation of Cx43
caused by OGD/R could disturb cell communication and substance exchanges, leading to the disruption of homeostasis. A
viewpoint has been offered that neuroprotection should be
equal for the protection of neurons and astrocytes. The protection of astrocytes could not only facilitate the preservation
of the integrity of brain matter but also be beneficial for the
growth of neurons. Heretofore, there have been few studies
associated with the relationship between Cx43 in astrocytes
and the growth of neurons. It was previously reported that
Cx43-mediated calcium waves could guide axon growth

directly[38]. Maintaining the distribution of Cx43 in the plasma
membrane has its own advantages for therapy in strokes.
Cells are maintained by Cx43 in their normal states by modulating the activities of certain pathways rather than purely suppressing them. Hence, the associated adverse effect could be
avoided. Additionally, this strategy does not focus on certain
types of pathways to compensate for deleterious responses
generated by stroke. Instead, the stabilization exerted by Cx43
could diminish abnormal changes upstream, which is possibly
more efficient and lucrative.
It is crucial to avoid the “trigger one, run all” dilemma in the
complex of cellular signaling pathways by stabilizing astrocytes rather than inhibiting the activity of the signal inflammatory pathway. Coalescence of neuron-death-prevention and
neuron-recovery promotion might be a silver lining for the
gloomy cloak of stroke, which would rationalize the potentiality of Cx43 as a target for the therapy of stroke based on astrocytes.
