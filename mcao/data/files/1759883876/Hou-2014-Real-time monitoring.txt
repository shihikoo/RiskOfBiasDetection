Purpose: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry using variable length multi-probe implantable
resonator (IR), was used to investigate the temporal changes in the ischemic and contralateral brain pO2
during stroke in rats.
Material and methods: The EPR signal to noise ratio (S/N) of the IR with four sensor loops at a depth of up
to 11 mm were compared with direct implantation of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc, oximetry probe)
deposits in vitro. These IRs were used to follow the temporal changes in pO2 at two sites in each
hemisphere during ischemia induced by left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats breathing 30%
O2 or 100% O2.
Results: The S/N ratios of the IRs were signiﬁcantly greater than the LiPc deposits. A similar pO2 at two sites
in each hemisphere prior to the onset of ischemia was observed in rats breathing 30% O2. However, a
signiﬁcant decline in the pO2 of the left cortex and striatum occurred during ischemia, but no change in the
pO2 of the contralateral brain was observed. A signiﬁcant increase in the pO2 of only the contralateral nonischemic brain was observed in the rats breathing 100% O2. No signiﬁcant difference in the infarct volume
was evident between the animals breathing 30% O2 or 100% O2 during ischemia.
Conclusions: EPR oximetry with IRs can repeatedly assess temporal changes in the brain pO2 at four sites
simultaneously during stroke. This oximetry approach can be used to test and develop interventions to
rescue ischemic tissue by modulating cerebral pO2 during stroke.

1. Introduction
Tissue pO2 is one of the most important factors in various
physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, it will be very
useful to develop methods for a direct assessment of tissue pO2 with
sufﬁcient sensitivity, accuracy and ease [1,2] to enhance our understanding of pathological processes, such as stroke, which is the foremost
cause of long-term disability and mortality in the United States.
Several methods have been developed to measure pO2, including
the Clark electrode, optical methods based on ﬂuorescence quenching
or phosphorescence quenching, MRI, PET and EPR oximetry [3–8]. Each
of these methods has speciﬁc advantages as well as limitations,
especially for repeated measurement of cerebral pO2 [5]. Clark
electrodes cause trauma when inserted into the brain and potentially
affect the pO2 measurements [3]. Optical techniques have a very
limited depth of measurement (b2 mm) when made non-invasively
from the surface. An alternate approach using an insertable ﬁberoptic

probe can provide measurements at greater depths, but cause acute
trauma at the time of measurement [6,9]. On the other hand, the
methods based on hemoglobin do not provide direct measure of tissue
pO2. MRI, PET and EPR imaging require repeated injections of contrast
agents, tracers or oximetry probes for serial measurement of the
oxygen levels in the tissue of interest [4,7,8]. EPR imaging with water
soluble probes provide either an average pO2 over a large tissue
volume (~0.5 cm3) with high temporal resolution using conventional
spectroscopy or high spatial resolution (~1 mm3) through imaging [5].
These methods have provided very useful information, however, the
need for repeated injection of the probes and tissue trauma associated
with some methods limits in vivo applications.
We have focused on the development of EPR oximetry using
particulate probes, which requires a one-time implantation of the
probe by a minimally invasive procedure but the rest of the method for
pO2 measurement is entirely non-invasive and can be repeated as
desired [2,10–12]. The basis of EPR oximetry is the paramagnetic nature
of molecular oxygen, which affects the EPR line widths of other
paramagnetic species, such as LiPc (oximetry probe), in its vicinity by
altering their relaxation rates. The magnitude of change in the EPR
line width is directly related to the amount of oxygen that is present

in the environment of the paramagnetic probes. The useful properties
of LiPc for EPR oximetry are their stability and the strong response of
their spectra to the presence of oxygen. The physicochemical
properties of the LiPc crystals have been described earlier [1,13].
Tissue pO2 measurements using 1.2 GHz EPR spectrometers can
be made at depths of less than 10 mm from the surface, which has
limited its application to mainly small experimental models.
Consequently, we have developed IRs that can be used to assess
pO2 at depths greater than 10 mm from the surface [14]. We report
the application of IRs with four-probes to assess the dynamic
changes in the regional oxygen levels at different depths (3 mm
and 5 mm) during ischemia by MCAO in rats. We also have
investigated the effect of 100% O2 breathing on ischemic and
contralateral brain pO2 and its consequence on infarct volume.
These results indicate that EPR oximetry with multiple probes IRs
can provide crucial information on the temporal changes in the rat
brain pO2 during stroke. We anticipate that this oximetry approach
can also be used to study the effect of other pathologies, such as
traumatic brain injury and intracranial hemorrhage, on cerebral
pO2 and develop interventions that can improve oxygen levels to
minimize tissue damage.

(ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed though a
midline incision of the neck. A silicone rubber-coated monoﬁlament
nylon suture (tip diameter 0.26 mm) was inserted into the ECA
through a stump, and the CCA was kept open and intact. The suture
was advanced into the ICA 18–20 mm beyond the carotid bifurcation
for occlusion to induce ischemia. The neck incision was closed with a
silk suture, and the rats were kept anesthetized. The incision was reopened 2 h later, and the intraluminal suture was carefully
withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The CCA and ICA were inspected
to ensure the return of pulsation indicative of reperfusion. The
incision was again closed, and the animals were allowed to recover
from anesthesia. The rats then were kept for 22 h with free access to
food and water.
All rats were sacriﬁced after 22 h of reperfusion, and the brains
were carefully removed and sectioned into 2 mm thick coronal
sections, starting 2 mm from the frontal pole. The slices were placed
in a 2% 2',3',5'-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution at
room temperature to stain viable brain, which demonstrates
mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity [16]. The sections were
photographed, and the volume of the infarct was determined by
an investigator blinded to the groups.

2. Materials and methods

2.3. Paramagnetic material and implantable resonators (IRs)

2.1. Animal and experimental groups

The oxygen sensitive LiPc crystals were synthesized in our
laboratory [13]. The IRs were constructed with a copper wire of
diameter 0.15 mm and had two sets of loops, a larger loop (coupling
loop) on one end and four small loops (sensor loops (SLs)) on the
other end of the transmission line (T), Fig. 1. The coupling loop has a
diameter of 10 mm and is used to couple inductively to the surface
loop resonator of the L-band EPR spectrometer. The sensor
loops (inner diameter of 0.2–0.3 mm) were loaded with LiPc crystals
(50–80 μg), and the entire IR was coated by gas permeable Teﬂon
AF2400 [14,17,18]. The SLs were implanted in the site of interest, and
the coupling loop was placed on the skull below the skin for coupling
with the surface loop resonator of the EPR spectrometer (Fig. 1A and B).
The length of the transmission lines (i.e. depth of tissue probed) was
3 mm for SL1, and SL4 and 5 mm for SL2 and SL3 from the surface.
The SL1 and SL2 were located in the normal cortex and striatum of
the contralateral hemisphere whereas the SL 3 and SL4 were located
in the striatum (peripheral area of the infarct) and cortex (core of
the infarct) during MCAO, respectively. The IRs were calibrated
before implantation into the brain (Fig. 1C) and the EPR spectra reﬂect

The Dartmouth College Animal Care and Use Program approved the
animal protocol. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory,
Wilmington, MA), each weighing 250–300 g were randomly divided
into two experimental groups: (i) control group (30% O2, N = 8);
(ii) hyperoxia group (100% O2, N = 6). All animals had EPR probes
placed 5–7 days prior to MCAO. The animals were subjected to a 2 h
of ischemia followed by reperfusion and sacriﬁce 22 h later.
2.2. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Animals were anesthetized with 2–2.5% isoﬂurane in 30% O2 for all
surgical procedures. During surgery, the body temperature was
monitored by a rectal probe, and maintained at 37 ± 0.5˚C with the
help of a warm water pad. The left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
occluded for 2 h with subsequent reperfusion according to the
method reported by Longa et al. [15] with few modiﬁcations [11,12].

the average pO2 on the surface of each SL ~ 0.11–0.15 mm 2. The
diameter and the number of sensor loops, the length of the
transmissions lines and the distance between sensor loops can be
adjusted based on the experimental requirements.
2.4. Multi-site EPR oximetry with IRs
For implantation of IRs, the rats were anesthetized (2–2.5%
isoﬂurane in 30% O2), and a small incision (1.5–2.0 cm) was made on
the skin, and four burr holes were drilled by using a 23 gauge needle
on the skull at predeﬁned co-ordinates (2.5 and 4 mm left and 2.5
and 4 mm right of the midline and 1 mm posterior to the bregma).
Four probes of IRs were gently inserted into the brain tissue through
these burr holes by using a stereotaxic frame. The holes were cleaned
and sealed with bone wax, and the skin sutured.
The oximetry measurements were performed on a 1.2 GHz EPR
spectrometer equipped with a surface loop resonator specially
designed for in vivo experiments [19,20]. The rats were placed
between the poles and the head positioned in the center of the EPR
magnet. The surface loop resonator was gently placed over the head
region with the coupling loop of IRs and adjusted to obtain the best
tuning of the spectrometer. A magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 3.0 G/cm
was used to separate the EPR spectra from each SL [21]. The peak-topeak line widths of the EPR spectra were used to determine pO2 by
using appropriate calibration of the IRs used in the study.
2.5. Experimental protocol
2.5.1. In vitro phantom experiments
The in vitro experiments were carried out in 2.0% agarose gel
(phantom) to compare the EPR line width (LW) and S/N of the IRs

at 0 min (baseline), 30, 60, 90 min of ischemia (I), 30 min of reperfusion (R), and 22 h of
reperfusion (R/22 h). The narrowing of the line width (intense EPR lines) corresponds to
a decrease in local pO2 when compared with the baseline. The numbers shown are the
pO2 values in mmHg acquired from each SL using multi-site EPR oximetry.

with different lengths of the transmission lines: (i) 6 mm and 11 mm
(IR-T6 & 11), and (ii) 3 mm and 5 mm (IR-T3 & 5) (Fig. 2A & B). Four
aggregates of LiPc crystals (approximately 100 μg each) were directly
implanted using a 23 Ga needle/plunger into the gel at the same
depth (Fig. 2C). Three to ﬁve samples for each experiment were used
to compare the LW and S/N of IRs with LiPc deposits. The EPR
settings for in vitro experiments was: the incident microwave power:
0.08–0.8 mW for IRs, 0.8–80 mW for LiPc deposits; gradient: 2.8–70
mT/m for IRs and LiPc deposits; modulation frequency 24 kHz; magnetic
ﬁeld center 425 G; scan time 10 sec, scan range 3–30 G, modulation
amplitude not exceeding one third of the peak-to-peak line width.
2.5.2. In vivo experiments
Five to seven days after the implantation of IRs with transmission
lines of 3 mm and 5 mm (T 3 & 5 mm), the animals were
anesthetized (1.5% isoﬂurane with 30% oxygen), and a pre-treatment
(baseline) pO2 measurement was made for 30 min at the four sites.
Thereafter, MCAO was performed, and pO2 measurements were
repeated for 30 min during which all the animals continued to
breathe 30% oxygen. After the conﬁrmation of a signiﬁcant decrease in
pO2 (ischemia), the breathing gas was switched to 100% O2 for 60 min
and then switched back to 30% O2 in the last 30 min of MCAO. The
animals of the control group continued to breathe 30% O2 during
MCAO. The typical EPR spectra collected during the baseline, ischemia
and reperfusion are shown in Fig. 3. During the experiments, the body
temperature of the rats was maintained at 37 ± 0.5˚C using a heated

water blanket and warm air forced though the core of the magnet. The
heart rate (H) and blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were
continuously measured by a Pulse Oximeter (Nonin 8600 V Pulse
Oximeter, Phoenix, Arizona) throughout the experiments. The EPR
settings for in vivo experiments were: the incident microwave power:
0.08–0.8 mW, gradient: 70–168 mT/m and other parameters described
for in vitro experiments.
2.6. Statistical analysis
A paired T test was used to compare the pO2 values at four sites
(SL) within the same group. The paired comparison reduces the
effects of animal-to-animal heterogeneity and eliminates differences
in the baseline pO2. The comparisons between groups including line
width and S/N ratio, the pO2 values and infarct volume were made
using a student's T test for unpaired samples. The tests were twosided, and a change with a p-value b0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. All data are expressed as mean ± SE, n is the number of
in vitro samples, and N is the number of rats in each group.
3. Results
3.1. In vitro calibration of IR in gas phase
The line widths of the EPR spectrum acquired from each
sensor loop of the IR-T3 & 5 were a linear function of pO2, Fig. 1C.

3.3. Measurement of cerebral pO2 during MCAO and the effect of 100% O2

Some differences in the response of the sensor loops at high
oxygen concentrations were observed. Therefore, each sensor loop
was calibrated individually, and the line width was converted to
pO2 using the corresponding calibration. Similar procedures were
followed with the calibration of IR-T6 & 11.

In the control group, no signiﬁcant difference in the baseline
(pre-ischemic) pO2 between all the sites was observed, Fig. 5. The
mean pO2 decreased signiﬁcantly in the cortex (ischemic core, SL4)
during the ﬁrst 30 min of MCAO (p b 0.01), while the pO2 of the
contralateral hemisphere (SL2 and SL1) remained at the baseline
level. The extent of decline in the pO2 of the core and striatum was
41 ± 4% and 84 ± 5% of the baseline in the ﬁrst 30 min of MCAO,
respectively (Table 1). There were signiﬁcant differences in the
extent of decline in the pO2 between the ischemic core and
peripheral area during MCAO (p b 0.01). The mean pO2 of the core
and peripheral area did not return to baseline during the ﬁrst 30 min
of reperfusion (p b 0.05). However, the mean brain pO2 of all the
four sites returned to baseline at 22 h of reperfusion (Fig. 5, Table 1).
In the 100% O2 group, no signiﬁcant difference in the mean
baseline pO2 between the four sites was observed, Fig. 6. The extent
of decline in the pO2 in the core and peripheral area during the ﬁrst
30 min of ischemia was 37 ± 4% (p b 0.01) and 75 ± 12% respectively, while the pO2 of the contralateral hemisphere (SL2 and SL1)
remained unchanged. Furthermore, there were signiﬁcant differences between the ischemic cortex and striatum tissue pO2 during
120 min of MCAO (p b 0.05), Fig. 6. The pO2 of the peripheral area
was not signiﬁcantly different from the baseline during 60 min of
breathing 100% O2, which is different from the control animals.
However, the pO2 declined signiﬁcantly when the breathing gas was
switched back to 30% during the last 30 min of ischemia (p b 0.05,
Table 1 and Fig. 6). The pO2 of the contralateral sites also increased
signiﬁcantly during breathing of 100% O2 but returned to baseline
when the 100% O2 was discontinued. The pO2 of the ischemic core
and peripheral area remained signiﬁcantly lower than the baseline
only during the ﬁrst 30 min of reperfusion.

3.2. In vitro EPR measurements in phantom (2.0% agarose gel)

3.4. Measurement of animal physiology and infarct volume

The line widths of each sensor loop of IR-T6 & 11 and IR-T3 & 5
implanted in phantom are shown in Fig. 4A. No signiﬁcant
differences in the line widths of the sensor loops were observed.
The line width of the sensor loops were pooled together and
compared with the line width obtained without gradient, Fig. 4B. The
differences in the LW of the IR-T6 & 11 and IR-T3 & 5 with or without
gradient were 4.1 ± 2% and 2.1 ± 1.5%, respectively. The LW of the
IRs recorded without gradient were similar to that of the LiPc
deposits, however, the S/N ratio of the LiPc deposits were
signiﬁcantly smaller (p b 0.01, Fig. 4C, D). We were not able to
separate the EPR signals from the four LiPc deposits even at higher
gradients and microwave power.

Table 2 shows the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2),
heart rate (HR) and core temperature of animals breathing 30 % O2 or
100% O2. SpO2 values signiﬁcantly increased after 100% O2 as
compared to the baseline and control group. On the other hand, a
signiﬁcant increase in the HR and body temperature during ischemia
as compared to the baseline was observed only in the control group.
One hundred twenty minutes of MCAO followed by 22 h of
reperfusion resulted in a signiﬁcant infarct in the ischemic hemisphere
of all surviving rats in both groups. However, no signiﬁcant difference
in the infarct volume with 100% O2 (200.7 ± 38.5 mm3) compared to
the control group (251.8 ± 37.1 mm3) was observed. These results
are consistent with our previous ﬁnding [12].

4. Discussion
We have developed IRs to overcome the limited depth of tissue
pO2 measurement with direct implantation of particulate oximetry
probes at L-band EPR [14,17,22]. The IRs were constructed from
enameled copper wires and can be used to measure pO2 at any depth
from the surface. For simultaneous measurement of tissue pO2 at
multiple sites, IRs with multiple SLs can be used with magnetic ﬁeld
gradients. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate a signiﬁcantly
greater S/N with IRs compared to direct LiPc implants. Additionally,
the line widths of the IRs with different lengths of the transmission
lines for pO2 measurement at different depths (IR-T6 & 11 and IR-T3
& 5) had similar line widths in the presence or absence of the
magnetic ﬁeld gradients. These results indicate that the spatial
resolution as small as 1.5 mm between the SLs can be easily achieved
by applying appropriate magnetic ﬁeld gradient without any
distortion of the EPR signals.
The pO2 values at the four sites in the brain were stable over
30 min of baseline measurement in both control and 100% O2
groups. The tissue pO2 decreased signiﬁcantly in the core (SL 4)
and peripheral area (SL 3), but the pO2 of the contralateral
hemisphere (SL 2 and SL 1) did not change during MCAO. A
signiﬁcant increase in the pO2 of the contralateral brain during
60 min of breathing 100% O2 was evident, but no such changes
were observed in the ischemic region. Additionally, no signiﬁcant

difference in the infarct volume between the control and 100% O2
group was observed. These results are consistent with our previous
report in which LiPc implants were used for pO2 measurement in
rats subjected to 120 min of MCAO [12]. Liu et al. have reported the
pO2 of the penumbra using LiPc implants in rats breathing different
concentration of oxygen (30%, 70%, 95% or 100%) during 90 min of
MCAO [23]. The rats breathing 95% or 100% oxygen not only had
reduced infarct volume, but also maintained the pO2 at the pretreatment level. Singhal et al. noted that 100% O2 leads to reduced
infarct size, measured by serial MRI after 2 h MCAO followed by 1 h
of reperfusion [24]. Pan et al. compared rats breathing mixed
oxygen ⁄nitrogen (30%/70%), 100% oxygen, or mixed oxygen/heliox
(30%/70%) during ﬁlament-induced 120 min of MCAO. A signiﬁcant
decrease in infarct volume (TTC at 24 h) was observed in rats
breathing 30%/70% O2 using heliox (4%) compared to 100% O2
(16%) [25]. However, Beynon et al. did not ﬁnd any beneﬁcial effect
of 120 min of breathing 100% O2 initiated 60 min after transient
ﬁlament-induced MCAO for 150 min [26]. No signiﬁcant reduction
in the infarct volume or clinical impairment in the 100% O2 group
compared to the control group was observed after 90 min of MCAO
by Eschenfelder et al. [27].
No signiﬁcant increase in the pO2 of the ischemic regions was
observed during 60 min of breathing 100% O2 in our experiments,
which is consistent with no change in the infarct volume compared
to the control. The contradicting results discussed above are likely
due to a difference in the MCAO model, duration of ischemia, lack of
direct measurement of pO2 to verify the changes in oxygen levels,
and different durations of breathing100% O2. Additional studies are
planned to systematically investigate the effect of these variables on
the cerebral pO2, cerebral blood ﬂow and infarct volume.
5. Conclusions
These results demonstrate that EPR oximetry using multi-probe
IRs potentially can be used to investigate the effect of ischemiareperfusion on the cerebral pO2 at several sites simultaneously and
repeatedly over days. The IRs provide signiﬁcantly better S/N ratio as
compared to direct LiPc implants and can be used to measure pO2 at
depths greater than 10 mm from the surface. No signiﬁcant change
in the tissue pO2 of the ischemic region and consequently infarct
volume was observed with 60 min of breathing 100% O2 during
120 min of MCAO as compared to the control group. The IRs based
EPR oximetry approach will be especially useful to study cerebral
tissue pO2 in large experimental models, including primates, to
develop and test interventions to increase oxygen levels in the
ischemic regions to salvage cerebral tissue in stroke.
