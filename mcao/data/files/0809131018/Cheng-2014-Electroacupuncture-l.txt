Abstract
Background: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture-like stimulation at Baihui (GV20)
and Dazhui (GV14) acupoints (EA at acupoints) following mild cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Furthermore,
we investigated whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway is involved in the neuroprotection induced by EA at acupoints.
Methods: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 3 d.
EA at acupoints was applied 1 d postreperfusion then once daily for 2 consecutive days.
Results: Following the application of EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, we observed significant reductions
in the cerebral infarct area, neurological deficit scores, active caspase-3 protein expression, and apoptosis in the
ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion. We also observed markedly upregulated BDNF, phospho-Raf-1 (pRaf-1),
phospho-MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2), phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), phospho-90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90RSK), and
phospho-Bad (pBad) expression, and restored neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) expression. Pretreatment with the
MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 abrogated the effects of EA at acupoints on cerebral infarct size, neurological deficits, active
caspase-3 protein, and apoptosis in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion. Pretreatment with U0126 also
abrogated the effects of EA at acupoints on pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK, pBad, and NeuN expression, but did not
influence BDNF and pRaf-1 expression.
Conclusion: Overall, our study results indicated that EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, upregulates BDNF
expression to provide BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis through
activation of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/p90RSK/Bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion in mild MCAo.

Background
Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury produces large
amounts of reactive oxygen species, which initiate a series
of cellular events and that lead to necrosis and apoptosis
[1]. In mild transient focal cerebral ischemia, brain infarction can develop and progress in a delayed manner, and
become grossly visible after 3 d of reperfusion [2,3]. Apoptosis, which is dependent on caspase-3 activation, plays a
significant role in the pathology of the delayed infarction
and predominates in ischemic neurons during mild focal
cerebral ischemia [2-4]. Neurotrophic factors provide neuroprotection against caspase-3-dependent apoptosis by activating various signal transduction pathways following
cerebral I/R injury [5,6].
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member
of the neurotrophin family that plays an important role in
neuroplasticity, neuron development, differentiation, and
neuronal survival [7-9]. It binds to the specific tyrosine
kinase B (TrkB) receptor on neurons to activate two major
intracellular signal transduction pathways: the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [10]. Koh identified that
the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2
signaling pathway is a critical mediator of neuronal cell
survival against apoptosis in a focal cerebral ischemia
model in rats [11]. A number of studies have shown that
BDNF provides neuroprotective effects against apoptotic
cell death through the stimulation of a protein kinase cascade that includes the sequential activation of Raf-1,
MAPK/ERK kinase1/2 (MEK1/2), and ERK1/2 [12,13].
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 then phosphorylates the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), leading to
the phosphorylation of Bad and the attenuation of
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis [14,15]. In previous studies, BDNF agonists improved neurological function and
reduced infarct size in a transient focal cerebral ischemia
model in rats [16,17]. However, MEK/ERK inhibitors abrogated BDNF-induced neuroprotection in hippocampal
neurons in vitro [6] and in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury in vivo [18].
Chinese physicians have used acupuncture to treat
various disorders for several centuries [19]. According to
traditional Chinese medicine, Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui
(GV14) are both acupoints on the “Du meridian”, which
travels into the brain, and are commonly used to treat
stroke. Experimental studies in rats have shown that EA
stimulation at acupoints (such as Baihui and Shuigou
acupoints) can attenuate cerebral infarction and improve
neurological outcome after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) [20,21]. Kim et al. have reported
that pretreatment with EA at Baihui and Dazhui acupoints elicit neuroprotection through increased BDNF
and stromal cell derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) expression 1
d after MCAo [22]. Other studies have also shown that

EA can potentially provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic insults through activation of various survival signaling pathways [20,23-25]. However, the
detailed mechanisms underlying BDNF-induced neuroprotection resulting from EA stimulation at Baihui and
Dazhui acupoints following mild cerebral I/R injury remain unclear. The aim of this study was, therefore, to
evaluate the effects of EA-like stimulation at Baihui and
Dazhui acupoints (EA at acupoints) after 15 min of ischemia followed by 3 d of reperfusion, and to elucidate
the mechanisms involved in the BDNF-mediated signaling transduction pathway.

Methods
Experimental animals

Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 300 g to 350 g
were used. This study was reviewed and approved by
China Medical University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (Permit Number: 100-215-c), and the
committee recognized that the proposed experimental
procedures compiled with the Animal Protection Law by
the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan. All
the procedures with animals avoided or minimized discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.
The MCAo model

The MCAo model was established in the SD rats using an
intraluminal suture method as described previously [26].
Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and the right common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were
exposed by way of an incision in the midline neck prior to
ligation of the pterygopalatine artery close to its branch. A
3–0 nylon filament suture, blunted at the tip by a flame
and coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma, USA), was inserted
into the right external carotid artery (ECA) through the
CCA into the ICA for a distance of 20 mm to 25 mm to
block the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The
suture was removed slowly to reestablish the blood flow
after 15 min of MCAo. The rectal temperature of the rats
was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C throughout the experimental
procedure using an electrical heating pad.
Electrode implantation

Following the completion of the MCAo operation, the
rat’s head was fixed to the stereotactic frame and its
scalp or costal skin was incised. The electrode consisted
of 0.5-mm stainless steel wires used for acupoint (or
nonacupoint) stimulation. It was implanted in Baihui
(midpoint of the parietal bone, 4-mm depth of insertion
forward) and Dazhui (below the spinous process of the
seventh cervical vertebra, 5-mm depth of insertion vertically) acupoints, or in bilateral costal regions (nonacupoints). The rat was then returned to the cage.

Assessment of neurological status

The neurological status of each rat was assessed after 1 d
and 3 d of reperfusion. Motor, sensory, balance, and reflex
functions were determined using the modified neurological severity score as described previously [27]. The
neurological function of each rat was graded using a numeric scale from 0 to 18. (normal score, 0; maximal deficit
score, 18). Excepting the sham-operation group, rats with
neurological deficit scores equal to or greater than 7 after
1 d of reperfusion were included in further analyses,
whereas rats with neurological deficit scores less than 7
were excluded from subsequent analyses.
Experiment A
Grouping

Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 5 or 6):
the EA-like stimulation at acupoints (EA group), EA-like
stimulation at nonacupoints (non-acup), model, shamoperation (sham), treatment with U0126 in the EA
(U0126 + EA) and treatment with vehicle in the EA (vehicle + EA) groups. Rats in the EA group were subjected
to 15 min of MCAo. After 1 d of reperfusion, rats received EA at acupoints once daily for 2 consecutive days.
Rats were then sacrificed after 3 d of reperfusion. Rats in
the non-acup group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the EA group but received EA at nonacupoints. Rats in the model group were subjected to the
same procedure as rats in the EA group but did not receive EA. Rats in the sham group were subjected to the
same procedure as rats in the model group but the MCA
origin was not occluded. Rats in the U0126 + EA group
were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the EA
group but also received an intracerebroventricular (ICV)
injection of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 30 min prior to
the onset of EA at acupoints. Rats in the vehicle + EA
group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the
EA group but also received an ICV injection of the vehicle
30 min prior to the onset of EA at acupoints.
Intracerebroventricular injection of U0126 or vehicle

Rats were anesthetized with a 2% isoflurane/oxygen mixture and an ICV injection of a 4 μl solution containing
U0126 (4 μg in vehicle, #662005 Calbiochem) or vehicle
(DMSO diluted in saline) was administered to the right
hemisphere. Injections were performed using a Hamilton
syringe with a 26 gauge needle (Hamilton Company,
Nevada, USA). The location of each injection was
0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the
midline, and 3.5 mm deep into the skull surface.
Electroacupuncture-like stimulation at Baihui and Dazhui
acupoints or nonacupoints

An EA apparatus (Trio 300, ITO Co., Germany) was
used to generate EA at acupoints or nonacupoints for

Page 3 of 11

25 min once daily for 2 consecutive days. The stimulation parameters were 5 Hz amplitude-modulated wave,
2.7 mA to 3.0 mA intensity, and 150 μs pulse width. The
rats were awake and moving freely in the cage during
EA at acupoints or nonacupoints.
Measurement of cerebral infarct area

Following their neurological status evaluations after 3 d of
reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia.
The brains were removed immediately and cut into 2-mm
sections using a brain matrix. The sections were then
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Merck, Germany) for 15 min at 37°C. Brain tissue was differentiated according to staining: white for infarct area
and red for noninfarct area. The cerebral infarct areas of
the first 6 sections from the frontal lobe were measured
using image analysis software (ImageJ, Java). The ratio of
infarct area to total brain area was also calculated.
Experiment B

Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: EA, nonacup, model, sham and U0126 + EA groups. They were
then subjected to the experimental procedure described
in Experiment A.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis

After 3 d of reperfusion and 15 min of cerebral ischemia,
rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia (n = 5 or 6).
Rats were transcardially perfused with 200 ml 0.9% saline and 200 ml 4% paraformalaldehyde (PFA; pH 7.4).
Rat brains were removed quickly and postfixed in 4%
PFA followed by 30% sucrose (weight/volume) for 3 d,
after which they were cut into 15-μm sections using a
cryostat. Brain sections were rinsed with Dulbecco’s
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.01% Tween-20 and immersed in 3% hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2)/methanol for 15 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. They were then incubated
with a 10% normal animal serum (ScyTek, Logan, Utah,
USA) for 20 min at room temperature (RT) before incubation in moist chambers with a rabbit anti-BDNF (1:500
dilution, AB1779 Millipore), rabbit anti-phospho-Raf-1
(pRaf-1) (1:100 dilution, sc-28005-R Santa Cruz), rabbit
anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2) (1:200 dilution, #2338
Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2
(pERK1/2) (1:200 dilution, #4376 Cell Signaling Technology), or rabbit anti-phospho-p90RSK (pp90RSK) (90 kD,
1:250 dilution, #9344 Cell Signaling Technology) antibody
overnight at 4°C. Following incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody and avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes (ABC kit, ScyTek, Logan, Utah, USA),
sections were colored using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) kit (ScyTek, Logan, Utah, USA), and counterstained
with hematoxylin. The stained sections were mounted in

mounting media (Assistant-Histokitt, Germany) and
immunopositive cells were detected using microscopic
analysis (Axioskop 40, Zeiss). Negative controls for BDNF,

right striatum, left cortex, and left striatum, and the right
cortex was weighed and homogenized in an ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.5 ml). Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant
was removed. After addition of 200 μl cytosol extraction
buffer A (#K266-25 BioVision, USA) and 11 μl cytosol extraction buffer B (#K266-25 BioVision, USA), the suspension was centrifuged at 16000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The
supernatant was collected and saved as the cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration of the cytosolic fraction
was determined using a Bio-Rad assay. The samples were
boiled at 100°C in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel loading buffer for 10 min and loaded onto a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the separated
proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-c Extra, Amersham Biosciences, UK) in
transfer buffer. The membranes were incubated in 5% skim
milk containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 60 min at RT to block
nonspecific binding. They were then incubated with a
rabbit anti-pMEK1/2 (1:1000 dilution, #2338 Cell Signaling
Technology), rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (1:1000 dilution, #4376
Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-pp90RSK (1:1000
dilution, #9344 Cell Signaling Technology), or rabbit antiphospho-Bad (pBad) (1:1000 dilution, #9291 Cell Signaling
Technology) antibody overnight at 4°C. The transferred
membranes were also probed with a monoclonal antibody
specific for actin (1:5000 dilution, MAB1501 Chemicon) as
an internal control for the cytosolic fraction. After washing,
membranes were incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-linked IgG (1:5000 dilution, Jackson
ImmunoResearch), an anti-mouse HRP-linked IgG (1:5000
dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a HRP-conjugated
anti-biotin (1:5000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology)
antibody in a PBS for 1 h at RT. Proteins were detected
using an enhanced chemiluminesence reagent kit (#34080
Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Densitometric analysis was performed using
Alpha Innotech Analyzer software. The optical density was
calculated and the levels of proteins were expressed as the
densitometric ratio of proteins to actin.

Immunohistochemical costaining

Brain sections were immersed in 3% H2O2/methanol for
15 min and then incubated with a diluted normal blocking serum (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) at RT for
25 min. Sections were then incubated with a mouse antineuronal nuclei (NeuN) antibody (1:200 dilution, MAB
377 Chemicon) 1.5 h at 37°C and washed with DPBS.
Following their incubation with the diluted biotinylated
secondary antibody and an ABC-AP reagent (AK-5002,
Vectastain), the sections were stained with an alkaline
phosphatase substrate solution (SK-5300, Vector Blue).
They were then incubated with a rabbit anti-active
caspase-3 antibody (17 kD, 1:100 dilution, AB3623 Chemicon) for 1.5 h at 37°C and washed with DPBS. Following
their incubation with the diluted biotinylated secondary
antibody and an ABC-AP reagent (AK-5001, Vectastain),
the sections were stained with an alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (SK-5100, Vector Red), dried, and mounted
in mounting media (Assistant-Histokitt, Germany). Finally,
the immunopositive cells were detected using microscopic
analysis (Axioskop 40, Zeiss).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin nick-end labeling analysis was used to identify
cells with nuclear DNA fragmentation in the ischemic
cortex. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling staining was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIA33
Calbiochem, USA). Briefly, brain sections adjacent to
those used in IHC analysis were incubated with 20 μg/
ml proteinase K for 20 min at RT, rinsed with a Trisbuffered saline and incubated with a 1 × TdT equilibration buffer for 30 min at RT. They were then incubated
with a TdT labeling reaction mixture for 1.5 h at 37°C.
After addition of the stop solution and blocking buffer,
sections were incubated with 1 × conjugate solution for
30 min at RT, and the TUNEL-positive cells were visualized using a DAB kit (Calbiochem). Finally, sections
were counterstained with methyl green (Calbiochem).

Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
All variables showed approximately normal distribution
and parametric testing, such as analysis of variance
(ANOVA), was appropriate. Data from all experimental
groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed
by post-hoc analysis using the Scheffe’s test. A P-value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Western blot analysis

Three days after reperfusion, the rats were anesthetized
with choral hydrate (n = 4). The rat brains were then removed and sectioned coronally from −4.3 mm to +1.7 mm
bregma. The brain was separated into the right cortex,

The percentage of cerebral infarct area among the

significant difference (P > 0.05; Figures 1 and 2A), indicating that U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), but not vehicle

(solvent), pretreatment eradicated the effects that caused
the significant differences in infarct area between the
model and EA groups.

EA, and vehicle + EA groups showed no significant difference (P > 0.05; Figure 2B). After 3 d of reperfusion,
the neurological deficit scores were higher in the model
group than in the sham group (P < 0.05). However, the
neurological deficit scores were markedly lower in the
EA and vehicle + EA groups than in the model group
(both P < 0.05; Figure 2B). After 3 d of reperfusion, the
neurological deficit scores in the model, non-acup, and

(P > 0.05; Figure 2B), indicating that U0126 pretreatment
eradicated the effects that caused the difference in
the neurological deficit scores between the model and
EA groups.

5A; Table 1). However, the levels of immunopositivity in
the non-acup and model groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05; Figures 3B, 4A, B and C and 5A;
Table 1). The numbers of BDNF- and pRaf-1-positive
cells in the ischemic cortex were significantly higher
in the U0126 + EA group than in the model group (both
P < 0.05; Figures 3B and 4A; Table 1). However, the numbers of pMEK1/2-, pERK1/2-, and pp90RSK-positive cells
in the U0126 + EA and model groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05; Figures 4B and C and 5A;
Table 1). These results indicated that U0126 pretreatment
did not influence BDNF or pRaf-1 positivity, but decreased pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and pp90RSK positivity in
the U0126 + EA group after 3 d of reperfusion.

Effects of EA at acupoints on BDNF, pRaf-1, pMEK1/2,

We evaluated BDNF-, pRaf-1-, pMEK1/2-, pERK1/2-, and
pp90RSK-positive cells within the dotted line square of
brain coronal sections (counts/1 mm2; Figure 3A). After 3
d of reperfusion, we observed a greater number of BDNF-,
pRaf-1-, pMEK1/2-, pERK1/2-, and pp90RSK-positive
cells in the ischemic cortex in the model, EA, non-acup,
and U0126 + EA groups compared to the sham group (all
P < 0.05; Figures 3B, 4A, B and C and 5A; Table 1). We
also observed a significantly higher number of BDNF-,
pRaf-1-, pMEK1/2-, pERK1/2-, and pp90RSK-positive
cells in the ischemic cortex in the EA group compared to
the model group (all P < 0.05; Figures 3B, 4A, B and C and

Effects of EA at acupoints on active caspase-3-NeuN
costaining

Analysis of active caspase-3-NeuN costaining revealed
numerous NeuN-positive cells (blue) in the sham group.
Active caspase-3-positive cells (red) were predominant
in the ischemic cortex in the model, non-acup, and
U0126 + EA groups, whereas NeuN-positive cells were
highly expressed in the EA group (Figure 5B). Cells displaying NeuN and active caspase-3 costaining (purple)
were scattered in the ischemic cortex in the model, nonacup, and U0126 + EA groups. Staining for NeuN and
active caspase-3 generally showed opposite patterns in
the experimental groups (Figure 5B).

We observed increased TUNEL positivity in the ischemic cortex in the model, EA, non-acup, and U0126 + EA
group (P < 0.05 vs. sham group; Figure 5C; Table 1) after
3 d of reperfusion. In the EA group, however, TUNEL
positivity was reduced significantly compared with the

model group (P < 0.05; Figure 5C; Table 1). The number
of TUNEL-positive cells in the model, non-acup, and
U0126 + EA groups showed no significant difference
(P > 0.05; Figure 5C; Table 1).
Effects of EA at acupoints on cytosolic expression of
pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK, and pBad

In western blot analysis, we observed that the cytosolic
expression of pMEK1/2 in the ischemic cortex after 3 d
of reperfusion showed no significant difference among
the model, non-acup, and U0126 + EA groups (P > 0.05).
However, cytosolic pMEK1/2 expression was significantly higher in the EA group than that in the model
group (2.7-fold, P < 0.05; Figure 6A and B). We also evaluated the expression of pERK1/2, the downstream target
of pMEK1/2, observing significantly higher cytosolic
pERK1/2 expression in the EA group compared with the
model group (1.8-fold, P < 0.05; Figure 6A and C). Cytosolic pERK1/2 expression among the model, non-acup,
and U0126 + EA groups showed no significant difference

of apoptosis inhibitors 6 h postreperfusion exerted beneficial effects on cerebral I/R insults after 3 d or 14 d of
reperfusion in mild MCAo [4,33]. In our TUNEL assays,
the number of apoptotic cells showed marked increases
in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion, and EA
at acupoints (initiated after 1 d of reperfusion) markedly
reduced apoptotic activity in the ischemic cortex. A previous study has reported that NeuN, a marker of mature
neurons, colocalized with apoptotic cells in the ischemic
area 3 d after mild focal cerebral ischemia [34]. In our
study, double staining for active caspase-3 and NeuN revealed that active caspase-3-labeling colocalized with
relatively weak NeuN labeling, and markedly increased
in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion, consistent with changes in apoptosis. However, EA at acupoints
markedly suppressed any increases in active caspase-3labeling. In contrast, EA at acupoints effectively restored
NeuN labeling through antigen retrieval. These results
are consistent with those of the study by Cheng et al.,
which identified a negative feedback loop between
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and NeuN immunoreactivity in the model and caspase inhibitor-treated groups
following cerebral I/R injury [35]. Our findings further
indicated that EA at acupoints provides BDNF-mediated
neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury through inhibition of caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis in
the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion, and that
posttreatment of EA at acupoints extends the effective
time window for up to 24 h postreperfusion following
mild MCAo.
Previous studies have well-described that BDNF promotes cortical neuron survival in response to ischemic insult through activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway,
which includes Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation [10,36,37]. They have also shown that activation of
the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway provides
neuroprotective effects through the inhibition of neuronal
apoptosis during focal cerebral ischemia [11,14,15]. The
downstream target of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is p90RSK and a number of studies have proposed that pharmacologically selective activation of the
Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway elicits neuroprotective effects through the phosphorylation of p90RSK
and Bad. Phosphorylated Bad binds to 14-3-3 to prevent
the interaction between Bad and antiapoptotic proteins
(Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), which inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation and suppresses caspase3-dependent apoptosis in permanent [11,38] and mild
transient [39] MCAo models. However, it remains obscure
whether BDNF-mediated neuroprotection resulting from
EA stimulation involves phosphorylation of p90RSK and
Bad following cerebral I/R injury. When evaluating the expression of molecules related to the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway, we observed sparse pRaf-1, pMEK1/2, pERK1/2,

Discussion
In this study, a 15-min period of MCAo consistently
caused gross infarction after 3 d of reperfusion. This result was in accordance with those of previous studies, in
which mild focal cerebral ischemia models showed
markedly delayed infarct development after 72 h of reperfusion [2-4]. Our data also indicated that EA at acupoints, applied at 1 d after cerebral I/R injury and once
daily for 2 consecutive days, effectively reduced cerebral
infarct areas and neurological deficits, whereas EA at
nonacupoints did not attenuate cerebral ischemic injury
and behavioral deficits after 3 d of reperfusion. Previous
studies have reported that preconditioning with repeated
EA at the Baihui acupoint provided neuroprotective
effects against focal cerebral ischemia in rats [20,28].
Our study findings further indicated that 2 repeated EAlike stimulations at Baihui and Dazhui acupoints, but
not at nonacupoints, provided significant neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury in a mild focal cerebral
ischemia model.
Accumulating evidence has shown that BDNF plays an
important role in brain development and plasticity, and
that exogenous and endogenous BDNF promote synaptic
plasticity and axon growth, which correlate positively
with behavioral change and neurological recovery in
transient cerebral I/R injury [29-31]. Studies have also
shown that BDNF exerts neuroprotective effects against
cerebral infarction by activating intercellular survival signaling pathways in transient MCAo in rats [10,16,32]. In
our evaluations, we observed that EA at acupoints increased the expression of BDNF in the ischemic cortex
significantly after 3 d of reperfusion. On the basis of
these findings, we suggest that EA at acupoints exerted
its neuroprotective effects against cerebral infarction and
behavioral deficits in our mild MCAo model, at least
partly, through the upregulation of BDNF expression.
Apoptosis is a prominent feature in mild focal cerebral
ischemia and plays a crucial pathological role in the development of delayed infarction. Active caspase-3, which
is a pivotal apoptotic executioner and causes cells to
undergo nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation,
was increased significantly 24 h to 72 h postreperfusion
[2]. Other studies have reported that the administration

and pp90RSK expression in the ischemic cortex after 3 d
of reperfusion. However, EA at acupoints effectively
increased the expression of these protein kinases in
our mild transient MCAo model. Western blot analysis
further showed that EA at acupoints effectively increased
the cytosolic expression of pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK,
and pBad in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion. Our results suggested that EA at acupoints elicits
BDNF-mediated neuroprotective action against caspase-3dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the
Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and that the
ERK1/2 signaling pathway-mediated neuroprotective effects of EA at acupoints can be further attributed to the
phosphorylation of p90RSK and Bad in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion following mild MCAo.
During cerebral ischemia progression, the survival signaling cascades activated by neuroprotective agents include the PI3K and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways,
which can cause cross-reactions and prevent apoptosis
[15,37]. Several reports have described that EA posttreatment elicits neuroprotective action against ischemic
insults through the activation of the PI3k signaling pathway after 1 d of reperfusion in mild [24,25] and moderate [23] focal cerebral ischemia models. One study done
by Du et al., has shown that EA pretreatment elicited
neuroprotective effects through activation of the ERK1/2
signaling pathway after 1 d of reperfusion in a severe
MCAo model [20]. These results indicated that EA treatment can potentially provide neuroprotection against
cerebral I/R injury by activating PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in MCAo models. Previous studies have also
reported that pharmacological activators of the ERK1/2
signaling pathway elicit neuroprotection through the
upregulation of BDNF expression in cerebral ischemia
models [9,40]. Therefore, to gain further insight into
the possible role of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in
BDNF-mediated neuroprotection induced by EA at
acupoints, we examined the effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, which can inhibit activation of ERK1/2
by inhibiting MEK1/2 and eradicate ERK1/2 signaling
pathway-mediated neuroprotective effects in transient
MCAo [20,39]. In our evaluations, we observed that in
the U0126 + EA group, administration of U0126 30 min
prior to the onset of EA at acupoints fully eradicated
the neuroprotective effects of EA at acupoints against
cerebral infarction, neurological deficits, and caspase-3dependent neuronal apoptosis after 3 d of reperfusion.
During further analysis of the expression of ERK1/2
signaling-related protein kinases and BDNF, we observed that pretreatment with U0126 abrogated the upregulating effects of EA at acupoints on cytoplasmic
pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, pp90RSK and pBad expression.
However, U0126 pretreatment did not affect the upregulating effects of EA at acupoints on upstream kinase

pRaf-1 or BDNF expression. Based on these findings,
we propose that EA at acupoints (initiated 1 d postreperfusion) upregulated BDNF expression, which subsequently
upregulated the expression of Raf-1. In addition, U0126
pretreatment eradicated the ERK1/2 signaling pathwaymediated neuroprotection induced by EA at acupoints,
confirming that in our mild MCAo model, activation of
the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and subsequent phosphorylation of p90RSK and Bad, induced BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis
after 3 d of reperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to show that EA at acupoints induces BDNFmediated neuroprotection against apoptosis through phosphorylation of ERK1/2/p90RSk/Bad pathway in the model
of mild transient focal cerebral ischemia.

Conclusion
In this study, EA at acupoints, initiated 1 d postreperfusion, effectively upregulated BDNF expression to provide
BDNF-mediated neuroprotection against neuronal apoptosis through phosphorylation of the Raf-1/MEK1/2/
ERK1/2/p90RSK/Bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion. Our data suggest that EA at acupoints could
potentially provide a therapeutic strategy to extend the
time window in mild cerebral I/R injury, and warrants
further investigation for future clinic application.
