Abstract
We previously reported that conventional protein kinase C
(cPKC)b participated in hypoxic preconditioning-induced
neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic injury, and collapsin response-mediated protein 2 (CRMP2) was identiﬁed
as a cPKCb interacting protein. In this study, we explored
the regulation of CRMP2 phosphorylation and proteolysis by
cPKCb, and their role in ischemic injury of oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD)-treated cortical neurons and brains of
mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced ischemic
stroke. The results demonstrated that cPKCb-mediated
CRMP2 phosphorylation via the cPKCb-selective activator
12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate (DOPPA) and
inhibition of calpain-mediated CRMP2 proteolysis by calpeptin and a fusing peptide containing TAT peptide and the

calpain cleavage site of CRMP2 (TAT-CRMP2) protected
neurons against OGD-induced cell death through inhibiting
CRMP2 proteolysis in cultured cortical neurons. The OGDinduced nuclear translocation of the CRMP2 breakdown
product was inhibited by DOPPA, calpeptin, and TATCRMP2 in cortical neurons. In addition, both cPKCb
activation and CRMP2 proteolysis inhibition by hypoxic
preconditioning and intracerebroventricular injections of
DOPPA, calpeptin, and TAT-CRMP2 improved the neurological deﬁcit in addition to reducing the infarct volume and
proportions of cells with pyknotic nuclei in the peri-infact
region of mice with ischemic stroke. These results suggested that cPKCb modulates CRMP2 phosphorylation and
proteolysis, and cPKCb activation alleviates ischemic injury
in the cultured cortical neurons and brains of mice with

Aside from other cardiovascular diseases, stroke ranks as
the fourth fatal disease after heart diseases, cancer, and
chronic lower respiratory disease, and on average someone
dies of a stroke every 4 min (Mozaffarian et al. 2015).
Ischemic/hypoxic preconditioning (I/HPC) is deﬁned as an
endogenous phenomenon in which sublethal hypoxia or
ischemia exposure makes the tissues/organs resistant to
later severe hypoxic/ischemic insults (Murry et al. 1986).
The molecular mechanisms underlying I/HPC are of great
interest because of their profound therapeutic potential
(Gidday 2006; Sanders et al. 2010; Kitagawa 2012). There
are multiple reported mechanisms of I/HPC, and protein
kinase C (PKC) appears to play an essential role (Zhao
et al. 2012).
We previously reported that conventional PKC (cPKC)b
participated in HPC-induced neuroprotection against middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic injury
and that 49 cPKCb-interacting proteins were identiﬁed in the
cortex of HPC mice (Li et al. 2005; Niu et al. 2005; Bu et al.
2011). Among the 10 cPKCb-interacting proteins whose
detection changed after HPC, collapsin response-mediated
protein 2 (CRMP2) was found to be distributed in both
cytosolic and particulate fractions, leading to the suggestion
that CRMP2 might play an important role in cPKCb-mediated
neuroprotection (Bu et al. 2011).
CRMP2 was identiﬁed in 1995 as an intracellular transducer of the extracellular semaphorin 3A signal transduction
pathway (Goshima et al. 1995). It was found concentrated in
growing axons, dendrites, and cytoplasms of neurons
(Inagaki et al. 2001). It is important in the determination of
neuronal polarity and axonal elongation during neuron
development (Arimura et al. 2004). As the most abundantly
expressed member of the CRMP family in the mature brain,
CRMP2, is thought to play an important role in pathophysiological processes in adult central nervous system (Wang
and Strittmatter 1996). For example, CRMP2 has been
reported to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
epilepsy, neuropathic pain, prion disease as well as focal
cerebral ischemia, and many other neuropathological processes (Czech et al. 2004; Chung et al. 2005; Shinkai-Ouchi
et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2013; Fischer et al. 2014). Several
studies have reported the changes of CRMP2 detection
during the process of ischemia. Koh (2011) and Chen et al.
(2007) reported elevation of CRMP2 protein expression in
the ischemic brain, while Sato and Xiong and colleagues
reported that hypoxia–ischemia caused dephosphorylation of

CRMP2 in neonatal brain (Sato et al. 2011; Xiong et al.
2012). Evidence also showed that the intact CRMP2
decreased, whereas the CRMP2 breakdown product (BDP)
appeared in the rat brain during ischemia (Chung et al. 2005;
Jiang et al. 2007). Papers also reported that CRMP2 was
cleaved by calpain at the C-terminal to form the BDP (Chung
et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2007). Although these studies
observed changes of CRMP2 during focal cerebral ischemia,
the pathophysiological role of CRMP2 in ischemic injury is
still unclear. In this study, the regulation of CRMP2
phosphorylation and proteolysis by cPKCb and their roles
in ischemic injury in cultured cortical neurons and brains of
mice with ischemic stroke were explored.

Material and methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO,
USA) except for the individually indicated agents and antibodies.
Adult (8–10 weeks old) male BALB/c mice weighing 20–25 g and
postnatal 0 day were purchased from the Experimental Animal
Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, PR China. The
experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Capital Medical University and are consistent with the
National Institutes of Health (NIH, USA) Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.
Primary cortical neuron culture and oxygen–glucose deprivation
treatment
The postnatal day 0 BABL/c mice were killed within 24 h. The
brains were removed and placed in ice-cold 10 mM phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The cortices were then dissected out, cut into
small pieces, and transferred into 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin–EDTA
(Gibco Inc., Grand island, NY, USA) for 20 min at 37°C. High
glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (5 mL; Gibco Inc.,
Rockville, MD, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum,
10% (v/v) equine serum, and 2 mM L-glutamine was added to
terminate the action of trypsin. Mild trituration using a Pasteur
pipette was used to create a cell suspension. Cells were plated onto
poly-L-lysine-coated 60-mm culture dishes (2 9 106 cells per dish)
for Western blot assay, 24-well plates with cover slips (2 9 105
cells per well) for immunoﬂuorescent staining, or 96-well plates
(1.5 9 104 cells per well) for Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. The medium was replaced by serum-free neurobasal
medium containing 2% B27 supplement (Gibco Inc.) 4 h later.
After culturing in neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 for
7 days, the cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD) treatment. The hypoxia incubator (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Marietta, OH, USA) was used in the OGD experiment.

The incubator is capable to maintain O2 at a certain level through
persistently pumping N2 into the incubator. The neurons were
replaced with glucose-free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
and placed in the incubator. The time point when the atmosphere in
the incubator was stabilized (5% CO2/1% O2/94% N2) was recorded
as the starting time. At the end of 1 h OGD exposure, cells were
maintained in regular neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 under
normoxic conditions for 24 h reoxygenation.
cPKCb and CRMP2 modification in OGD-injured primary cultured
cortical neurons
cPKCb was activated by the addition of 0.1 lM 12-deoxyphorbol 13phenylacetate 20-acetate (DOPPA; Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) (Macfarlane and Manzel 1994). Calpeptin (0.2,
0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 lM; Enzo Life Sciences Inc.) was used to inhibit
calpain-mediated cleavage of CRMP2. CRMP2 cleavage was also
blocked by the addition of a fusing peptide containing TAT peptide
and the calpain cleavage site of CRMP2 (TAT-CRMP2) (0.1, 0.25,
and 0.5 lM, sequence: YGRKKRRQRRRGVPRGLYDGPVCEV,
California Bioscience Inc., Sacramento, CA, USA), a fusion peptide
containing TAT peptide (transduction domain of HIV-1 transactivator transcription protein) and the calpain cleavage site of
CRMP2 (Xu et al. 2007). All the chemicals above were added in the
medium 1 h before and during the induction of OGD.
Animal models and treatments
The repetitive autohypoxia-induced hypoxic preconditioning (HPC)
mouse model was performed as our previous reports (Lu and Liu
2001; Bu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011). Brieﬂy, mice were placed
in a 125-mL jar full of normoxic air and then the jar was sealed
with a rubber plug so that continued breathing induced progressive
hypoxia. The autohypoxia-treated mice were removed from the jar
to normoxic conditions when the ﬁrst signs of gasping appeared and
recovered for 30 min. After the recovery period, mice were
switched to another hermetically sealed jar. This procedure was
repeated four times to obtain the HPC mice; normoxic control mice
were placed in open jars for the same amount of times. The oxygen
concentration inside the jar at the moment of the ﬁrst gasping
appearance was about 6.6% in the ﬁrst run and 3.8% in the fourth
run, respectively.
Two in vivo models of ischemia were used. The ﬁrst was
induction of 1 h transient MCAO with sacriﬁce at 24 h. The second
was permanent MCAO with sacriﬁce at 6 h. Brieﬂy, using methods
previously described (Bu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011; Feng et al.
2013), mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.06 g/kg
i.p.). A ventral midline incision was then made to expose the left
common carotid artery, and external and internal carotid arteries.
The left common carotid artery and external carotid artery were
ligated. For transient MCAO, an arteriotomy was made in the left
external carotid artery, and then a blunt-tipped 5-0 surgical nylon
ﬁlament (0.22  0.01 mm in diameter; Beijing Cinontech, Beijing,
China) was inserted through the external carotid artery to the
internal carotid to a point approximately 12-mm distal to the carotid
bifurcation to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 1 h
occlusion, the ﬁlament was carefully withdrawn to restore blood
ﬂow and the mice were kept for 24 h. For permanent MCAO, the
same ﬁlament was inserted via the common carotid artery. Mice
were kept for 6 h before being killed. The ischemic penumbra or

peri-infarct region exits more apparently, and the effects of cPKCb
on CRMP2 phosphorylation and proteolysis are obvious at this time
point. In the sham groups, mice received the same surgical exposure
without occlusion. During the surgery, body temperature was
maintained at 37°C using a heating lamp and thermal blanket. Mice
were placed in a postoperative cage, kept warm, and undisturbed for
at least 2 h with regular observation.
cPKCb and CRMP2 modification in MCAO mice by
intracerebroventricularly injection
Dimethylamine analog LY333531 (200 nM, 5 lL, cPKCb-speciﬁc
inhibitor) (Jirousek et al. 1996), DOPPA (2 lM, 5 lL, cPKCbselective activator), calpeptin (20 lM, 5 lL, calpain inhibitor), and
TAT-CRMP2 (10 lM, 5 lL), which can prevent the cleavage of
endogenous CRMP2, were intracerebroventricularly injected just
before MCAO as in our previous reports (Bu et al. 2011; Zhang
et al. 2011). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital
sodium (0.06 g/kg i.p.) and ﬁxed in a stereotaxic frame. The cannula
(28-gauge, inner diameter 0.18 mm, outer diameter 0.36 mm) tip
was inserted into the left cerebral ventricle at a point 0.5 mm
posterior to bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to bregma, and 3.5 mm below
the skull surface. The dosages of LY333531, DOPPA, calpeptin,
and TAT-CRMP2 were determined by our preliminary experiments.
Measurement of cerebral blood flow
Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was monitored by laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry (Perimed Periﬂux system 5000, J€arf€alla-Stockholm,
Sweden). The tip of the probe was ﬁxed to the surface of skull
over the MCA supplied core area (2 mm posterior to bregma and
6 mm lateral to midline). Cerebral blood ﬂow during MCAO and
reperfusion was expressed as a percentage of the baseline value.
Neurological deficit scoring and behavioral test
Neurological deﬁcit scores were evaluated as reported previously
(Longa et al. 1989) by an observer blinded to the treatment: 0, no
deﬁcit; 1, ﬂexion of contralateral forelimb upon lifting of the whole
animal by the tail; 2, circling to the contralateral side; 3, falling to
the contralateral side; and 4, no spontaneous motor activity.
Behavioral tests were performed by an observer blinded to the
treatment. The wire hanging test and pole test were performed as
described previously (Ji et al. 2009). The wire hanging test was
used to assess the motor deﬁcits of mice. Mice were trained to cling
with their forepaws to a steel wire (1 mm) stretched between two
posts 60 cm above a thick protective pad 2 days before the actual
test. On the day of testing, latency to fall was tested three times and
results were averaged. The pole test was carried out using a vertical
steel pole covered with tape to create a rough surface. Mice were
placed near the top of the pole with head upward. The time taken to
turn completely downward and the total time to reach the ﬂoor with
all four paws were recorded. Each animal was tested three times and
the average time was taken as the results.
Immunofluorescent staining of CRMP2 and cell viability assay in
cultured cortical neurons
After the treatment of OGD, cells grown on cover slips were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde and goat serum in PBST was used for 1 h as a
block to prevent non-speciﬁc antibody binding. Cells were then
incubated with rabbit anti-CRMP2 (1 : 500, #9393; Cell Signaling

Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) overnight. After washing, the
secondary Alexa Fluorâ 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1 : 500, green ﬂuorescent; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was
added and incubated for 2 h. Finally, 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
was used to stain the nuclei. Cover slips were dried at 4°C
overnight. Slides were mounted and observed under a ﬂuorescence
microscope system (Leica DM4000B, Wetzlar, Germany).
According to the manufacturer’s instruction, the cell viability of
cultured cortical neurons was assessed by Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium
bromide (MTT, 0.5 mg/mL; Applichem Inc., Omaha, NE, USA).
The OD490 for the control group was set to 100%, and the other
groups were presented as a percentage of control.
Measurements of infarct size by TTC staining
After permanent and transient MCAO, blind measurements of the
infarct volume were taken. Mice were killed, and the brains were
quickly removed and cut into 1.5-mm thickness coronal sections.
Brain sections were incubated in 0.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) solution at 37°C for 20 min, and then the images of
the slices were scanned into a computer. The infarct volume was
analyzed according to the evaluation procedure of our previous
reports (Bu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011), and expressed as the
percentage
of
total
brain
through
the
equation:
I = [∑VI 9 (1  E)/∑VT 9 (1  B)] 9 100%. ∑VI is the volume of tissue that is not stained with TTC, ∑VT is the total brain
volume, E is edema ratio that was calculated from (∑VL  ∑VR)/
(∑VL + ∑VR) 9 100%, ∑VL and ∑VR are the volume of left
ischemic and right non-ischemic hemisphere, B is background
(∑VS/∑VT) 9 100%, ∑VS is the volume of the unstained white
matter in the sham group, and ∑VT is the total brain volume.
Nissl staining
Nissl staining was used to assess the neural cell damage in brain
sections. Mice for this measurement were deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with 100 mM PBS containing 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and postﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde followed by graded sucrose solutions (20% for
24 h and 30% for another 24 h) to dehydrate. Then brains were cut
into 20-lm thick slices, washed in fresh PBS, stained with 0.04%
cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich), and dissolved in acetate buffer for
1 h. Images were photographed under a Nikon 50i light microscopy
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Sample preparation and Western blot analysis
At the end of 1 h OGD followed by 24 h reoxygenation, cells in 60mm dishes were washed three times with PBS and then stored at
70°C. For the required regions of cortexes, the brains from killed
mice were immediately placed into ice-cold artiﬁcial cerebral spinal
ﬂuid (in mM: NaCl 125.0, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2.0, NaHCO3 26.0,
NaH2PO4 1.25, MgCl2 1.0, glucose 5.0, pH 7.4) bubbled with 95%
O2/5% CO2 and dissected as previous reports (Ashwal et al. 1998;
Niu et al. 2005). In brief, 2 mm from the anterior tip of the frontal
lobe was removed and the remaining brain was sectioned to four 2mm thickness slices. Each hemisphere was longitudinally cut 1 mm
from the midline to remove the tissue supplied by the anterior
cerebral artery. A 45-degree angle transverse diagonal cut was then
made to separate the ischemic core and peri-infarct region. The
corresponding regions from the non-ischemic hemisphere were

449

dissected as contralateral controls. All the tissues were frozen in
liquid nitrogen and kept frozen at 70°C for later analysis.
To obtain whole cell lysates, the cultured cortical neurons and
tissue samples were rapidly thawed and homogenized at 25°C in
buffer C [5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol,
2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid (EGTA), 5 lg/mL each of leupeptin, aprotinin,
pepstatin A, and chymostatin, 50 mM potassium ﬂuoride, 50 lM
okadaic acid, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2% sodium dodecyl
sulfate] and sonicated. Protein concentration was determined by
bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce Company, Rockford, IL, USA) with
albumin diluted in buffer C as standard.
Samples loaded with the equal amount of proteins (50 lg) were
electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel,
and then transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) at 4°C. After several
rinses with Tween/Tris-buffered salt solution (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH
7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), the transferred PVDF
membrane was blocked with 10% non-fat milk in Tween/Trisbuffered salt solution for 1 h. The blocked PVDF membrane was
then incubated with the primary polyclonal antibodies of rabbit
anti-CRMP2 (1 : 1000, #9393; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit
anti-phospho-CRMP2 (T514, 1 : 2000, ab62478; Abcam Inc.,
Cambridge, MA, USA), or rabbit anti-caspase-3 (1 : 1000, #9662;
Cell Signaling Technology) for 3 h at 25°C. To verify equal loading
of protein, the blots were reprobed with primary monoclonal
antibody of mouse anti-b-actin (1 : 10 000, 60008-1-Ig; Proteintech
Group, Chicago, IL, USA) or mouse anti-b-tubulin polyclonal
antibody (1 : 10 000, 10094-1-AP; Proteintech Group). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
(1 : 5000; Stressgen Biotechnologies Corporation, Victoria, BC,
Canada) were incubated as second antibodies for 1 h. After
incubation with the secondary antibodies, the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare) was used to detect the signals.
Statistics and analysis
The Gel Doc-2000 imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to perform the quantitative analysis of
Western blot results. For CRMP2 protein level, the ratio of intact
CRMP2 densities to b-actin band density in the control group was
expressed as 1.0; for the changes in CRMP2 phosphorylation, the
ratio of p-CRMP2 band density to total CRMP2 band densities was
expressed as 1.0 in control group. The ratio of cleaved caspase-3
band density to procaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 band densities
was normalized to 1.0 in control. The data from other groups were
represented as ratio of that from control group. The presented values
were expressed as mean  SE. Statistical analysis was conducted
by one-way ANOVA followed by all pairwise multiple comparison
procedures using Bonferroni test, with signiﬁcance cut-off set as
p < 0.05.

neurons under simulated ischemic conditions (Bretin et al.
2006; Zhang et al. 2007). In this study, cortical neurons from
postnatal mice were cultured for 7 days, and then subjected
to 1 h OGD followed by 24 h reoxygenation in regular
medium. We found that the intact CRMP2 (I-CRMP2,
Fig. 1a and b, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test,
p < 0.001, n = 6 per group) protein levels reduced significantly, while BDP appeared and the CRMP2 phosphorylation level decreased (p-CRMP2, Fig. 1a and b, p < 0.05,
n = 6 per group) in 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation-treated
cortical neurons. However, the cPKCb-selective activator
DOPPA (0.1 lM) promoted higher p-CRMP2 and intact
CRMP2 levels, and inhibited the production of BDP when
compared with that of the 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation
group (Fig. 1a and b, p < 0.05, n = 6 per group). In
addition, the MTT assay results in Fig. 1(c) showed that
DOPPA could signiﬁcantly increase the cell survival rate of
1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation-treated cortical neurons

(Fig. 1c, p < 0.05, n = 8 per group). These results suggested
that cPKCb-mediated CRMP2 phosphorylation protects
cortical neurons against 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationinduced ischemic injuries through inhibiting CRMP2
proteolysis.
Inhibition of calpain-mediated CRMP2 proteolysis protects
cultured cortical neurons against OGD-induced ischemic
injury and cell apoptosis
To determine the role of CRMP2 proteolysis in 1 h OGD/
24 h reoxygenation-induced ischemic injuries, the calpain
inhibitor calpeptin and TAT-CRMP2 were used to block the
endogenous CRMP2 proteolysis.
As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), calpeptin signiﬁcantly
reduced the endogenous CRMP2 proteolysis at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0,
and 2.0 lM (p < 0.05, n = 5 per group) in 1 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation-treated cortical neurons. Similarly, TATCRMP2 (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 lM) also signiﬁcantly inhibits

the production of BDP in 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationtreated cortical neurons (Fig. 2c and d, p < 0.05, n = 5 per
group). The MTT assay results showed that both calpeptin
and TAT-CRMP2 effectively reduced the 1 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation-induced cell death in cultured neurons in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2e, p < 0.05, n = 8 per group).
In addition, we found that 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation
induced a signiﬁcant increase in cleaved caspase-3 (17 kD),
while TAT-CRMP2 dose dependently inhibited the cleavage
of procaspase-3 (34 kD, Fig. 2f and g, p < 0.05, n = 5 per
group). These results suggested that calpeptin and TATCRMP2 protect cortical neurons against 1 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation-induced ischemic injury and cell apoptosis
through inhibiting CRMP2 proteolysis.

BDP nuclear translocalization is involved in OGD-induced
ischemic injury in cultured cortical neuron
To determine whether changes of CRMP2 subcellular
distribution occurred after OGD, immunoﬂuorescent staining
was applied to observe CRMP2 expression in cortical
neurons following 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation treatment.
As shown in Fig. 3(a–c), CRMP2 was mainly expressed in
the cytoplasm of control cortical neurons, while the 1 h
OGD/24 h reoxygenation treatment caused an increase of
CRMP2 nuclear translocation (Fig. 3d–f). This OGDinduced nuclear localization of CRMP2 could be prevented
by pretreatment of cPKCb-selective activator DOPPA
(Fig. 3g–i), calpeptin (Fig. 3j–l), and TAT-CRMP2
(Fig. 3m–o).

involvement of (BDP) nuclear translocation
in ischemic injury.

cPKCb-mediated phosphorylation inhibits CRMP2
proteolysis and protects mouse brain after ischemic stroke
cPKCb-selective activator DOPPA was administered in
mouse brain to further determine whether cPKCb modulates
phosphorylation and proteolysis of CRMP2 in vivo. As
shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), there was a signiﬁcant decrease in
CRMP2 phosphorylation and an increase in CRMP2 proteolysis, but DOPPA inhibited the decrease in p-CRMP2 level

and the increase in BDP level both in ischemic core and periinfarct region of mice with 6 h permanent MCAO (p < 0.05,
n = 5 per group). Consistent with our previous report (Bu
et al. 2011), HPC-induced cPKCb activation played a
similar role to the DOPPA in CRMP2 phosphorylation and
proteolysis in ischemic core and peri-infarct region, but
intracerebroventricular injection of cPKCb-speciﬁc inhibitor
LY333531 could inhibit this effect of HPC on CRMP2

Fig. 4 Conventional protein kinase Cb (cPKCb)-mediated phosphorylation inhibits CRMP2 proteolysis and protects mouse brain with
ischemic stroke. The representative Western blot (a) and quantitative
analysis (b) results demonstrated that the activation of cPKCb by
intracerebroventricular injection of 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate
20-acetate (DOPPA) signiﬁcantly inhibited ischemia-induced dephosphorylation and proteolysis of CRMP2 in ischemic core and peri-infarct
region of mice with 6 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (n = 5
per group); similarly, the typical Western blot (c) and quantitative
analysis (d) results indicated that hypoxic preconditioning (HPC)induced cPKCb activation could also inhibit both ischemia-induced

decrease of p-CRMP2 and increase of BDP, but intracerebroventricular injection of cPKCb-speciﬁc inhibitor LY333531 could inhibit HPCinduced inhibitory effect on dephosphorylation and proteolysis of
CRMP2 in ischemic core and peri-infarct region of mice with 6 h MCAO
(n = 5 per group); in addition, the neurological deﬁcit scores evaluation
(e) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (f and g) showed
that DOPPA could reduce the neurological deﬁcit scores (n = 8 per

phosphorylation and proteolysis (Fig. 4c and d, p < 0.05,
n = 5 per group). In addition, the TTC staining results
showed that DOPPA could reduce the neurological deﬁcit
scores (Fig. 4e, p < 0.05, n = 8 per group) and the infarct
volume (Fig. 4f and g, p < 0.05, n = 5 per group) of mice
with 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion, which indicates that
cPKCb-mediated CRMP2 phosphorylation can protect the
brain against ischemic injury in mice with ischemic stroke
through inhibiting CRMP2 proteolysis in vivo.
Inhibition of calpain-mediated CRMP2 proteolysis protects
brain against ischemic injury of mice with ischemic stroke
To further determine the neuroprotective effect of CRMP2
proteolysis inhibition in vivo, calpeptin and TATCRMP2 were intracerebroventricularly injected to inhibit
CRMP2 proteolysis in mouse brain with transient MCAO. As
shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), calpeptin effectively suppressed
the production of BDP both in ischemic core and in the periinfarct region (p < 0.05, n = 4 per group) and reduced the
neurological deﬁcit scores (Fig. 6a, p < 0.05, n = 9 per
group) and infarct volume (Fig. 6b and c, p < 0.05, n = 5
per group) of mice with 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion.
We previously reported that TAT-CRMP2 could inhibit
CRMP2 dephosphorylation and proteolysis in ischemic core
of mice with 6 h permanent MCAO (Bu et al. 2011). Here,
we applied transient MCAO mouse model to determine the
neuroprotective effect of TAT-CRMP2 on the brain of mice
with ischemic stroke. Cerebral blood ﬂow was monitored
during MCAO and 20 min of reperfusion by laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry. After the onset of MCAO, CBF sharply reduced
to about 20% of baseline value and this was maintained
during the 1 h of MCAO. The decrease of CBF in TATCRMP2 administrated mice was not signiﬁcantly different
from control ischemic mice (Fig. 5c, n = 4 per group).
Intracerebroventricular injection of TAT-CRMP2 could
inhibit CRMP2 proteolysis in ischemic core and peri-infact
region of mice with 1 h transient MCAO followed by 24 h
reperfusion (Fig. 5d and e, p < 0.05, n = 6 per group). Mice
treated with TAT-CRMP2 achieved lower scores than the
ischemia group (Fig. 6a, p < 0.05, n = 9 per group). The
wire hanging test showed that ischemic mice clung to the
wire for less time than the sham animals and TAT-CRMP2
treatment made mice cling to the wire for longer (Fig. 6d,
p < 0.05, n = 7 per group). The pole test showed that
animals from the ischemic group took more time to turn their
head downward on the pole (time turn) and reach the ground
(time total) compared to the sham-operated groups. TATCRMP2 reduced the time for mice to turn their head and
reach the ground (Fig. 6e and f, p < 0.05, n = 7 per group).
The TTC and Nissl staining results demonstrated that TATCRMP2 effectively reduce both the infarct volume (Fig. 6b
and c, p < 0.05, n = 5 per group) and proportion of shrunken
cells with pyknotic nuclei in peri-infact region (Fig. 6i and j)
of brain with 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion. In addition, we

observed that TAT-CRMP2 reduced the cleavage of caspase3 in the peri-infarct region of ischemic mice (Fig. 6g and h,
p < 0.05, n = 5 per group). These results suggested that
calpeptin and TAT-CRMP2 protect brains against ischemic
injury of mice with ischemic stroke through inhibiting
calpain-mediated CRMP2 proteolysis in vivo.

Discussion
cPKCb including bI and bII isoforms belongs to the
conventional PKC family and its role in ischemia was
unclear. A harmful role of cPKCb has been reported in lung
and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Lung I/Rtreated cPKCb knockout and wild-type (WT) mice fed with
the cPKCb inhibitor ruboxistaurin showed increased survival
(Fujita et al. 2004). Similarly, cPKCb knockout and WT
mice fed with ruboxistaurin showed signiﬁcantly decreased
infarct size and cellular necrosis in a myocardial I/R model
(Kong et al. 2008). Conversely, a protective effect of cPKCb
against ischemic injury has been observed in central nervous
system. For example, cPKCb inhibition aggravated Nmethyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity and
cell death area in cultured hippocampal slices (Kowalczyk
et al. 2012). cPKCb activation was also reported to be
involved in the development of HPC both in vivo and
in vitro, and the cPKCb inhibitors Go6983 and LY333531
could block the neuroprotective effect of HPC, suggesting
that cPKCb mediated HPC-induced endogenous neuroprotection (Niu et al. 2005; Li et al. 2006; Bu et al. 2011). In
this study, we further observed that cPKCb activation by its
selective activator DOPPA could alleviate OGD-induced
ischemic injury in cultured cortical neurons and reduce the
brain infarct volume of mice with ischemic stroke, which
conﬁrms the neuroprotective effect of cPKCb in ischemicinduced injury in vitro and in vivo. In our previous studies to
elucidate cPKCb-mediated signaling networks, we have
reported 49 cPKCbII-interacting proteins. Among these
proteins, CRMP2 changed signiﬁcantly in both cytosolic
and particulate fraction in HPC mouse brain, suggesting the
possibility of CRMP2 as a downstream effector of cPKCb
action (Bu et al. 2011).
During the past decade, studies of the function of CRMP2
have mainly focused on neuronal polarity and neuron
development, with little being known about the pathophysiological role of CRMP2. Studies have reported that ischemia
could induce CRMP2 dephosphorylation and production of a
55 kD BDP, which was produced by calpain-mediated
proteolysis (Chung et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2007). We also
detected the dephosphorylation and proteolysis of CRMP2
both in OGD-treated cortical neurons and ischemic mouse
brain. In this study, the permanent 6 h MCAO mouse model
was used to determine the effect of cPKCb activity on
CRMP2 phosphorylation and proteolysis. The application of
cPKCb-selective activator DOPPA and HPC-induced

mice with ischemic stroke. The representative Western blot (a) and
quantitative analysis (b) results showed that intracerebroventricular

group) signiﬁcantly inhibit ischemia-induced CRMP2 proteolysis in
ischemic core and peri-infarct region of mice with 1 h MCAO/24 h
reperfusion. *p < 0.05 versus sham group; #p < 0.05 versus ischemia

cPKCb activation could inhibit ischemia-induced dephosphorylation and BDP production of CRMP2 in 6 h permanent MCAO mice. These results suggested that cPKCb could
mediate CRMP2 phosphorylation and thereby increase its
resistance to calpain-mediated proteolysis of CRMP2.

The C-terminal region of CRMP2 is highly rich in serine
and threonine, which can be phosphorylated by a number of
kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase 5, glycogen
synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b), Rho kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and protein kinase A

cPKCb-mediated CRMP2 proteolysis in ischemic brain

(Arimura et al. 2005; Uchida et al. 2005; Boudreau et al.
2009; Hou et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2014). Phosphorylation
of CRMP2 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5, GSK3b, and Rho
kinase lowers its binding afﬁnity to tubulin, thereby mediating the collapse of growth cones (Arimura et al. 2005), and
suggests that the biological function of CRMP2 could be
regulated by its phosphorylation. Although several studies
have reported a decrease of CRMP2 phosphorylation during
ischemia, its role in ischemic injury remains unclear. Hou
et al. (2009) has described calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II as a kinase upstream of CRMP2 with
phosphorylation preventing CPMP2 from being cleaved by
calpain and enhancing the integrity of axons in the face of
NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. We found that cPKCb is also
an upstream kinase of CRMP2 increasing its resistance to
calpain-mediated cleavage, and the neuroprotective effect of
cPKCb in ischemia is then probably mediated by CRMP2.
Calpain is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that is
ubiquitously expressed in various mammalian tissues and
plays a key role in cerebral ischemia. During cerebral
ischemia, calpain is activated by increased calcium inﬂux
through the hyper activation of glutamate receptors, and
inhibition of calpain can protect the brain against ischemic
injury (Vosler et al. 2008). In this study, we once again
demonstrated the detrimental role of calpain both in vitro and
in vivo. Calpain inhibition blocked CRMP2 proteolysis both
in the ischemic mouse brain and OGD-treated cortical
neurons, further conﬁrmed that CRMP2 was cleaved by
calpain. Pathophysiological activation of calpain during
ischemia results in the cleavage of a number of neuronal
substrates such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2),
growth-associated protein-43, postsynaptic density protein
95, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a), NR2A
and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors that regulate
neuronal structure and function, leading to disruption of
essential neuronal survival mechanisms (Siman and Noszek
1988; Zakharov and Mosevitsky 2001; Guttmann et al.
2002; Simpkins et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2007; Gascon et al.
2008). As a substrate of calpain, CRMP2 and its BDP may
be involved in calpain-modulated neuron death.
To better understand the role of CRMP2 and its BDP in
focal cerebral ischemia, we constructed a TAT-CRMP2
fusion peptide which contained the calpain cleavage site of
CRMP2. TAT peptide is derived from the transduction
domain of HIV-1 TAT protein and contains 11 residues
(YGRKKRRQRRR). TAT peptide can effectively transfer
the fusion peptide through the membrane to cells without
affecting its biological activity (Nagahara et al. 1998; Zhou
et al. 2009). The transfer process occurs within 10 min (Pei
et al. 2006). When TAT-CRMP2 was applied in cultured
cortical neurons and MCAO-treated mice, it effectively
inhibited calpain-mediated cleavage of CRMP2 and alleviated ischemic injury.

457

Calpain-mediated C-terminal cleavage of CRMP2 has
been reported to be involved in traumatic brain injury, focal
cerebral ischemia, Wallerian degeneration, and prion disease
(Jiang et al. 2007; Shinkai-Ouchi et al. 2010; Brittain et al.
2011; Wakatsuki et al. 2011). At present, the role of CRMP2
and its BDP in ischemia process remains unclear. Bretin
et al. (2006) observed that over-expression of BDP could
reduce the surface N2B subunit of glutamate receptors and
improve resistance to NMDA-induced exitotoxicity. Rogemond et al. (2008) found that BDP localized to the nucleus
and inhibited neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells after transfection with the short isoform of CRMP2. Tahimic et al. (2006)
also reported the nucleus translocation of CRMP2-truncated
fragment in ﬁbroblast cells which exhibited apoptosis-like
features. Nada and Shah (2012) reported that after exposure
of neurons to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) for 6 h,
the CRMP2 protein was dissociated from the axons and
dendrites and was observed concentrated in the nucleus. The
structure of BDP gives few clues to its speciﬁc function. It is
reported to contain a nuclear localization signal (Rogemond
et al. 2008) and the primary sequence of CRMP2 (17-471)
has some homology with the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme
but no enzymatic activity has been detected. In this study, we
demonstrated that TAT-CRMP2 inhibited the cleavage of
caspase-3 and CRMP2 nuclear localization in OGD-treated
cortical neurons; and this OGD-induced CRMP2 nuclear
localization could also be blocked by DOPPA-mediated
cPKCb activation and inhibition of calpain-mediated
CRMP2 proteolysis. These observations further suggested
that CRMP2 is a common target of both cPKCb and calpain,
and BDP as CRMP2 proteolysis product may play an
important role in ischemic injuries such as cell apoptosis in
the cultured cortical neurons and brains of mice with
ischemic stroke. However, further evidence is needed to
determine whether BDP works through the nuclear localization.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that cPKCb mediates the
phosphorylation and proteolysis of CRMP2, and cPKCb
activation alleviates ischemic injury in the cultured cortical
neurons and brains of mice with ischemic stroke through
inhibiting CRMP2 proteolysis by phosphorylation.
