Background and Purpose—The ATP-binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA1) gene is a key target of the transcription
factors liver X receptors. Liver X receptor activation has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in animal ischemic
stroke models. Here, we tested the hypothesis that brain ABCA1 reduces blood–brain barrier (BBB) and white matter
(WM) impairment in the ischemic brain after stroke.
Methods—Adult brain-specific ABCA1–deficient (ABCA1−B/−B) and floxed-control (ABCA1fl/fl) mice were subjected to
permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion and were euthanized 7 days after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Functional outcome, infarct volume, BBB leakage, and WM damage were analyzed.
Results—Compared with ABCA1fl/fl mice, ABCA1−B/−B mice showed marginally (P=0.052) increased lesion volume but
significantly increased BBB leakage and WM damage in the ischemic brain and more severe neurological deficits. Brain
ABCA1–deficient mice exhibited increased the level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and reduced the level of insulinlike growth factor 1 in the ischemic brain. BBB leakage was inversely correlated (r=−0.073; P<0.05) with aquaporin-4
expression. Reduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 and aquaporin-4, but upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9
expression were also found in the primary astrocyte cultures derived from ABCA1−B/−B mice. Cultured primary cortical
neurons derived from C57BL/6 wild-type mice with ABCA1−B/−B astrocyte–conditioned medium exhibited decreased
neurite outgrowth compared with culture with ABCA1fl/fl astrocyte–conditioned medium. ABCA1−B/−B primary cortical
neurons show significantly decreased neurite outgrowth, which was attenuated by insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment.
Conclusions—We demonstrate that brain ABCA1 deficiency increases BBB leakage, WM/axonal damage, and functional
deficits after stroke. Concomitant reduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9
may contribute to brain ABCA1 deficiency–induced BBB and WM/axonal damage in the ischemic brain.   (Stroke.

A-1 (ABCA1) regulates the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to form apoE-containing lipoprotein
particles and plays a critical role in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism in the central
nervous system.1–3 ABCA1 gene expression is regulated by
liver X receptors, transcriptional factors involved in lipid
metabolisms and inflammation.4,5 Activation of liver X receptors using synthetic liver X receptor agonists, T0901317 and
GW3965, decreases neuroinflammation, promotes synaptic
plasticity and axonal regeneration, and improves neurological functional outcome after cerebral ischemia.4,6,7 ABCA1
has anti-inflammatory effects in both brain and the peripheral

blood system, which implies its neuroprotective potential.5,8
Compared with wild-type mice, mice lacking brain ABCA1
exhibit fewer synapses and synaptic vesicle changes in neurons and increased neuroinflammation in the brain.3,5
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is composed of brain capillary endothelial cells connected by tight junctions and pericytes that share common basement membrane extracellular
matrix proteins that form the perivascular space. Vascular
cells, including smooth muscle cells, brain capillary endothelial cells and pericytes, neural cells, ie, neurons, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocytes, and microglia form the neurovascular
unit which is the functional unit of the BBB.9,10 Cells forming
the neurovascular unit express ABCA1 that plays an important

role in the maintenance of BBB and neurovascular unit stability.2,11 However, the effects of ABCA1 on stroke-induced BBB
and white matter (WM) damage have not been investigated.
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is not only involved in
brain growth, development, and myelination but also in neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis.12 IGF1 has neuroprotective
properties and attenuates stroke-induced BBB damage concomitantly with rapid immunosuppression and sustained antiinflammation in brain.13 IGF1 decreases cholesterol efflux via
ABCA1 and scavenger receptor class B type I expression.14
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) is a major contributing
factor to BBB leakage after stroke.15,16 Whether MMP9 and
IGF1 mediate brain ABCA1 deficiency–induced BBB and
WM damages after stroke has not been investigated. In this
study, we tested the effects and underlying mechanisms of
brain ABCA1 deficiency in the regulation of BBB, WM and
axonal damages, and functional outcome after stroke.

Methods
Animal Model and Experimental Group
Adult (2–3 months) male brain ABCA1 knockout (ABCA1-floxed
x nestin-Cre positive, ABCA1−B/−B) and control (ABCA1-floxed,
ABCA1fl/fl) mice were generated using the Cre/loxP recombination
system.3 Mice were subjected to permanent distal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (dMCAo)17 and were euthanized 7 days after dMCAo for neurological functional evaluation, immunostaining (n=9 in
ABCA1fl/fl mice; n=11 in ABCA1−B/−B mice), western blot, and realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays (n=4 per group).
Sham-operated mice (n=6 per group) underwent the same surgical
procedure without ligation of dMCAo.

Functional Test
The adhesive removal test, a sensitive test of somatosensory function
in mice for dMCAo model,17 was performed before dMCAo and at 1,
3, and 7 days after dMCAo by an investigator who was blinded to the
experimental groups, as previously described.17

Histological and Immunohistochemical Assessment
and Lesion Volume Measurement
Animal brains were fixed and embedded in paraffin. The cerebral tissues were cut into 7 equally spaced (1 mm) coronal blocks. A series
of adjacent 6-μm thick sections were cut from each block and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for the calculation of lesion volumes.
Every 10th coronal section was cut from the center of the lesion
(bregma −1 mm to +1 mm), and a total 5 of sections were used for immunostaining. Histochemical double staining for Bielschowsky silver
(BS, an axon marker) and Luxol fast blue (LFB, a myelin marker)6
and immunostaining for albumin (infiltration into the brain is a marker of BBB leakage,15 1:500; Abcam), aquaporin-4 (AQP4, a marker
of astrocytic endfeet, an important functional component of the BBB
and neurovascular unit,9,18 1:500; Abcam), adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes,19 1:100; GenWay),
and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα, a marker of
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [OPCs],20 1:100; Chemicon) were
used.

Immunostaining Quantization
Images were acquired from 5 slides from each brain, with each slide
containing 4 field views from the ischemic core, ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) of the cortex, or the corpus callosum, respectively
(Figure 1A). The area that stained positive for albumin in the ischemic
core area of cortex and for AQP4 in the IBZ of cortex, the number of

and the percentage of BS+/LFB+-area in the IBZ of the corpus callosum were analyzed at ×40 magnification with a Micro Computer
Imaging Device imaging analysis system (Imaging Research).

Primary Brain Astrocyte Cultures
The pregnant ABCA1fl/fl mice were euthanized, and E15 embryos
were harvested. Genotyping was performed to identify ABCA1−B/−B
(n=7) or ABCA1fl/fl (n=6) embryos. Primary astrocytes were isolated
and cultured, as previously described.21 Passage 2 astrocytes were
used and cultured with DMEM medium with l-glutamine without
d-glucose and sodium pyruvate (Gibco) followed by 3 hours of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD).7 The astrocyte-conditioned medium
was collected and stored at −80°C for primary cortical neuron (PCN)
culture use. The astrocytes were used for western blotting and realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

PCN Culture and Neurite-Outgrowth
Measurements
First, we tested whether ABCA1 knockdown in astrocyte regulates
PCN neurite outgrowth; PCN cultures with astrocyte-conditioned
medium derived from ABCA1−B/−B and ABCA1fl/fl mice were used.
PCNs were isolated from E15 embryos from a C57BL/6 wild-type
mouse (Jackson Laboratory, n=8). On day in vitro 3, the PCNs were
subjected to 3-hour OGD for hypoxic ischemia, and then treated with
conditioned medium derived from ABCA1−B/−B or ABCA1fl/fl astrocytes for 24 hours (n=6 wells per group).

Second, we tested whether reduced ABCA1 in neurons regulates
neurite outgrowth and whether IGF1 mediates the neurite outgrowth.
PCN cultures were isolated from E15 embryos of ABCA1−B/−B (n=7)
and ABCA1fl/fl (n=6). After 3-hour OGD, the experimental groups include (1) ABCA1fl/fl-PCNs, (2) ABCA1−B/−B-PCNs, (3) ABCA1−B/−BPCNs treated with IGF1 (recombinant mouse IGF1 protein, 100 ng/
mL; Abcam, Cat number ab9861, n=6 wells per group) for 24 hours.
PCN cultures were immunostained for neuronal class III β-tubulin
(a phenotypic marker of neural cells, 1:1000; Covance) with Cy3.
neuronal class III β-tubulin–positive cells and neurites were photographed at ×10 magnification using a fluorescent microscope. The
average neurite length of the 20 longest neurites in each well (6 wells
per group) was measured using the Micro Computer Imaging Device
analysis system.

(P<0.05; n=11) compared with ABCA1fl/fl mice (n=9) 7 days
after stroke (Figure 2A).
AQP4 protein expression was significantly decreased
in both the sham brains and in the IBZ of the cortex in the
ABCA1−B/−B mice compared with ABCA1fl/fl mice after stroke
measured by immunostaining (Figure 2B) and western blot
(Figure 2C; P<0.05) 7 days after dMCAo. In addition, the
density of AQP4 was inversely correlated with the amount
of albumin accumulation in the IBZ (Figure 2D; r =−0.73;
P<0.05).

Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction

WM is composed of bundles of myelinated axons, and oligodendrocytes are the only myelin-forming cells in the central
nervous system and maintain long-term axonal integrity.19,22 To
test whether brain ABCA1 deficiency regulates axon and WM
damage after stroke, the density of BS+/LFB+ and the number of
APC+ cells in the IBZ of corpus callosum were measured. There
was no significant difference in BS+/LFB+ density and APC+ cell
numbers in the sham brains between ABCA1−B/−B and ABCA1fl/fl
mice. However, the BS+/LBF+ density and APC+ cell numbers
were significantly decreased in the IBZ of the corpus callosum
in ABCA1−B/−B mice (n=11) compared with the ABCA1fl/fl mice
(n=9) after stroke (Figure 3A and 3B; P<0.05).
In adult animals, OPCs are present in the brain parenchyma
after stroke and are generated in the subventricular zone of
the lateral ventricle where they proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into new oligodendrocytes.19,22 To test whether brain
ABCA1 deletion decreases OPC numbers, the number of
PDGFRα+ OPCs was also measured. We found that the number of PDGFRα+ OPCs in the IBZ of the corpus callosum and
cortex significantly increased in ABCA1fl/fl mice after stroke
compared with sham brain. In addition, compared with the
ABCA1fl/fl mice, ABCA1−B/−B mice with stroke exhibited significant decreases in PDGFRα+ OPC numbers in the IBZ of the
corpus callosum and cortex, which indicates that ABCA1 may
regulate OPC generation after stroke (Figure 3C; P<0.05).

The ipsilateral brain and the homologous areas from the sham
brain (Figure 1A) and the harvested astrocyte cultures were
used for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

anti-MMP9 (1:500, Santa Cruz), and anti-β-actin (1:10 000, Abcam)
were used, as previously described.20

Statistical Analysis
Differences in the functional outcome and lesion volume were analyzed using Student t test. The percentage of albumin+, AQP4+, BS+/
LFB+-area and APC+, PDGFRα+ cell numbers, protein and mRNA
expression were analyzed using 2-factor ANOVA followed by post
hoc Bonferroni test. One-way ANOVA and least significant difference test were performed for neurite outgrowth. Correlation between
the percentage of AQP4+ and albumin+ areas was tested by Pearson
correlation coefficients.

Results
Brain ABCA1 Deficiency Worsens Functional
Outcome After Stroke
There was a marginal increase in the lesion volume (P=0.052;
Figure 1B) and a significant increase in neurological deficits at
1, 3, and 7 days after dMCAo in ABCA1−B/−B mice compared
with ABCA1fl/fl mice (P<0.05; Figure 1C).

Brain ABCA1 Deficiency Increases BBB
Dysfunction After Stroke
To test whether brain ABCA1 deficiency regulates BBB leakage
after stroke, expression of albumin and AQP4 in the ischemic
brain was measured. There was no albumin infiltration, evident
in the nonstroke brains either in ABCA1−B/−B or in ABCA1fl/fl mice
receiving sham surgery. However, albumin infiltration was observed
near the ischemic core in both ABCA1−B/−B and ABCA1fl/fl mice.
Albumin density was significantly increased in ABCA1−B/−B mice

Brain ABCA1 Deficiency Increases MMP9 and

MMP9 is a marker of neuroinflammation.16 IGF1 has antiinflammatory properties.12,13 To elucidate the mechanisms
responsible for the increased BBB leakage and WM damage
and worse functional outcome in ABCA1−B/−B mice, expression of MMP9 and IGF1 was measured by western blot
(Figure 4A) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Figure 4B), respectively. The data show that MMP9
expression in the ischemic brains was significantly increased,
whereas IGF1 expression was significantly decreased in both
sham and ischemic brains in ABCA1−B/−B mice compared with
ABCA1fl/fl mice (P<0.05; n=4 per group).

levels of MMP9 were increased, whereas AQP4 and IGF1
were decreased (Figure 5A and 5B) in the primary cultured
ABCA1−B/−B astrocytes (n=7) compared with ABCA1fl/fl astrocytes (P<0.05; n=6) after OGD.

Brain ABCA1 Deficiency Decreases Neurite
Outgrowth, Whereas IGF Attenuates this Reduction
To investigate whether ABCA1 knockdown in both neurons and
astrocytes regulates neurite outgrowth, the PCN and astrocyte
cultures derived from E15 ABCA1−B/−B and ABCA1fl/fl embryos
were used. Neurite outgrowth was significantly decreased in
wild-type PCNs cultured with ABCA1−B/−B astrocyte–conditioned medium when compared with the ABCA1fl/fl astrocyte–
conditioned medium treatment group (Figure 5C; P<0.05; n=6
per group).
To further elucidate the pathway responsible for the
reduced neurite outgrowth in ABCA1 deficiency, IGF1 treatment was used. Neurite outgrowth was significantly decreased

in ABCA1−B/−B-PCNs compared with ABCA1fl/fl-PCNs after
OGD, whereas IGF1 (100 ng/mL) treatment significantly
attenuated this reduction (Figure 5D; P<0.05; n=6 per group).

Discussion
Stroke leads to BBB disruption and WM and axonal damages that are associated with long-term disability after stroke.
Astrocytic endfeet are tightly attached to neurons on one side
and to brain capillary endothelial cells and pericytes of the
BBB on the other side, thereby connecting neurons and vascular cells, and play a decisive role in BBB maintenance.9 In
rodent brain, AQP4 is primarily expressed in astrocytic endfeet in contact with BBB and mediates water homeostasis.23
AQP4 may have biphasic effects in stroke injury and neuroprotection; for example, AQP4 is related to the early stages
of cerebral edema and neuroinflammation within 2 to 4 days
after ischemia.23,24 However, at a later phase post brain injury
(7 days to 1 month), AQP4 may play a beneficial role and
may inhibit activation of microglia and promote resolution of

edema.25 The upregulation of AQP4 causes increased water
clearance from the tissue and decreased BBB disruption and
neutrophil infiltration, as well as decreased proinflammatory
cytokines.25 Using nestin-Cre system, ABCA1 was primarily knocked out from neural cells but not from brain capillary
endothelial cells in ABCA1−B/−B mice.3 In this study, we found
that brain ABCA1 deficiency significantly increased BBB
leakage in the ischemic brain but decreased AQP4 expression in both the sham and the ischemic brain after stroke, and
BBB leakage was inversely correlated with the AQP4 expression in the ischemic brain after stroke. In addition, a decrease
of AQP4 expression was found in primary astrocyte cultures
after OGD. These data indicated that brain ABCA1 deficiency
decreases astrocytic endfeet protein expression, which may
contribute to BBB dysfunction in the sham brain and increased

BBB leakage after stroke. Pericytes also play a pivotal role in
the formation and maintenance of the adult BBB.10 Pericytes
project elongated, stellate-shaped finger-like processes that
unsheath >70% of the abluminal side of the capillary wall,10,26
and astrocytes directly communicate with pericytes in addition to endothelial cells.27 Pericyte deficiency in the central
nervous system leads to BBB breakdown and brain hypoperfusion, resulting in secondary neurodegenerative changes.10
Because pericytes also express nestin,28 therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that ABCA1 is also deleted from pericytes, in addition to neural cells. Further studies on this issue
are warranted.
BBB leakage post ischemic stroke might be, in part,
explained by the increase vascular–associated MMP9 activity because tight junction proteins and basement membrane

reduces brain infarction in mice after MCAo.30 Knockout of
MMP9 significantly decreases BBB disruption and myelin
basic protein reduction and prevents macrophage-induced
axonal retraction after ischemia31; MMP9 activity was significantly increased in the ischemic brain of type 2 diabetic mice
which correlated with the increased WM damage after stroke.20
Neuroinflammation exacerbates BBB leakage in the ischemic
brain, resulting in increased lesion volume and neurological
deficits.29 ABCA1 is a potent anti-inflammatory factor. The
systemic anti-inflammatory role of ABCA1 in the periphery
has been studied using global ABCA1 knockout mice and
macrophage-specific ABCA1 knockout mice.8 ABCA1−B/−B
mice also exhibit neuroinflammatory response, including
increased nuclear factor κB and tumor necrosis factor-α gene
expression in the brain.5 BBB dysfunction also promotes WM
and axonal damages.15 Ischemia-induced WM injury is generated by selectively upregulating neuroinflammation and BBB
damage, which may be associated with the increased infarction
volume and neurological deficits.29 In this study, we found that
brain ABCA1 deficiency increases MMP9 expression in both
the ischemic brain and cultured astrocytes under OGD conditions, which may contribute to the induction of BBB leakage
and WM damage in the ischemic brain. However, MMPs may
be beneficial during delayed phases after stroke because MMPs
modulate the brain extracellular matrix and may mediate and
facilitate beneficial plasticity and remodeling during stroke
recovery.32 MMP9 was upregulated in the peri-infarct cortex
at 7 to 14 days after stroke and is colocalized with markers
of neurovascular remodeling. Treatment with MMP inhibitors
at 7 days after stroke suppresses neurovascular remodeling,
increases ischemic brain injury, and impairs functional recovery at 14 days.32 Therefore, the long-term effects of MMP9
post stroke using this model warrants investigation.
IGF1 is not thought to easily cross the BBB. Local production from astrocytes and microglia is the main source
of IGF1 in the brain.33 Astrocyte-specific overexpression of
IGF1 protects hippocampal neurons and reduces behavioral
deficits after traumatic brain injury.34 Exogenous administration of IGF1 into the cerebral lateral ventricle significantly
reduces the BBB breakdown, brain edema formation, and

deficiency–induced blood–brain barrier (BBB) and white matter

cellular/tissue injuries.13 Administration of IGF1 within a few
hours after brain injury is protective in both gray and WM
and leads to improved somatic function.35 For example, intracerebraventricular infusion of IGF1 prevented the loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin basic protein density 4 days after
ischemia reperfusion.35 In this study, brain ABCA1 deficiency
decreased IGF1 expression in the sham and in the ischemic
brain, as well as the hypoxic ischemic astrocyte cultures,
which coexists with BBB dysfunction and axonal impairment in the sham brain and increased BBB leakage and WM
damage in the ischemic brain. These data indicate that brain
ABCA1 deficiency–induced decrease in IGF1 may also contribute to the increased BBB leakage and WM damage after
stroke. However, the mechanism underlying how ABCA1 regulates IGF1 expression is not clear and warrants investigation.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that
brain ABCA1 deficiency increases BBB leakage, WM/axonal damage, and functional deficits after stroke. Concomitant
reduction of IGF1 and elevation of MMP9 may contribute
to brain ABCA1 deficiency–induced BBB and WM/axonal
damage (Figure 6).
