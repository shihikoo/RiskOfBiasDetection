Few effective therapeutic interventions are available to limit brain damage and functional deﬁcits after
ischaemic stroke. Within this context, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy carries minimal risks while
remaining efﬁcacious through the secretion of trophic, protective, neurogenic and angiogenic factors. The
limited survival rate of MSCs restricts their beneﬁcial effects. The usefulness of a three-dimensional support, such as a pharmacologically active microcarrier (PAM), on the survival of MSCs during hypoxia has
been shown in vitro, especially when the PAMs were loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF). In the present study, the effect of MSCs attached to laminin-PAMs (LM-PAMs), releasing VEGF
or not, was evaluated in vivo in a model of transient stroke. The parameters assessed were infarct volume,
functional recovery and endogenous cellular reactions. LM-PAMs induced the expression of neuronal
markers by MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the prolonged release of VEGF increased angiogenesis around the site of implantation of the LM-PAMs and facilitated the migration of immature neurons
towards the ischaemic tissue. Nonetheless, MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF failed to improve sensorimotor functions. The use of LM-PAMs to convey MSCs and to deliver growth factors could be an effective strategy
to repair the brain damage caused by a stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death and disabilities. The failure of
many clinical trials designed to demonstrate neuroprotection, in
which the acute phase of the pathology was targeted, has encouraged the examination of therapeutic strategies which could be
applied beyond the acute phase and in which it ought to be possible to enhance post-injury brain repair [1]. Among these strategies,
stem cell therapy has been the subject of several investigations [2].

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are readily extracted from bone
marrow and thus are widely available to be employed as therapeutic agents in order to replace and/or repair injured brain tissue.
Studies have shown that MSCs attenuate neuronal loss and accelerate functional recovery following stroke in animal models [3]
and patients [4]. These investigations underscore the safety of
MSCs and their capacity to induce brain plasticity when administered in either the sub-acute or chronic stage of stroke. The therapeutic capacities of MSCs are attributed principally to their
paracrine actions as a source of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, neurogenic and/or mitogenic factors and their ability to migrate into
the damaged tissue [5]. Nevertheless, these advantageous actions
of MSCs are likely to be restricted because of the hostile environment that reigns within the ischaemic tissue, a milieu which hampers the viability, differentiation and integration of the grafted

78

cells into the host tissue [6]. For example, hypoxia, inﬂammation,
paucity of beneﬁcial cytokines and accumulation of deleterious
molecules within the destructured ischaemic tissue are among
the factors that might limit MSC viability and differentiation [7].
Among the strategies to increase the survival and/or differentiation
rate of grafted cells is the use of a supportive scaffold.
Recently, pharmacologically active microcarriers (PAMs), which
are biodegradable microspheres that are able to convey cells on
their functionalized surfaces and offer a three-dimensional microenvironment, were employed in a number of neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke [8,9]. To mimic the
extracellular matrix and promote the engraftment of stem cells
on the scaffold, many peptides derived from the extracellular
matrix have been tested as a coating, such as laminin, which
enhances neurite outgrowth and promotes the differentiation of
MSCs into cells of a neuronal phenotype, both morphologically
and functionally [10]. In addition, these carriers can be concomitantly loaded with growth factors that are released progressively
in a sustained and controlled manner around the grafted stem
cells. The efﬁcacy of this concept was ﬁrst demonstrated in a rat
paradigm of Parkinson’s disease, with PC12 cells and PAMs releasing nerve growth factor (NGF) or glial cell-derived neurotrophic
factor [11,12].
In order to enhance angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) has been loaded into PAMs and engrafted in association with neural stem cells (NSC) in an ischaemic tissue [8]. NSCs
combined with PAMs releasing VEGF promoted the recruitment
of endothelial cells into the lesioned striatum. Nonetheless, the
authors failed to examine the fate of the grafted stem cells, and
their impact on endogenous cellular reactions as well as, importantly, on the functional recovery of the treated rats. We recently
reported that treatment with PAMs releasing VEGF enhances
MSC proliferation and survival in vitro in an oxygen–glucose deprivation model [13]. Altogether, these data suggest that the use of
PAMs to release growth factors such as VEGF in a sustained manner
could be considered as a novel approach to improving the survival
of MSCs in ischaemic tissue. Therefore, the aims of the present
study were, ﬁrst, to examine whether the delivery of MSCs
attached to laminin-coated PAMs (LM-PAMs) improves the survival and differentiation of the transplanted cells and, consequently, their effects on brain damage and functional recovery in
rats subjected to stroke, and secondly, to evaluate the effects of
MSCs conveyed by LM-PAMs releasing VEGF in vitro on the fate
of MSCs and in vivo on the endogenous cellular reactions (neurogenesis, angiogenesis, glial reaction) that occur concomitantly with
functional recovery at both the acute and chronic stages of stroke
in the rat.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
All experiments were carried out on male Sprague–Dawley rats
(CERJ, France) weighing 300–350 g. The animal investigations were
performed in accordance with European Directive 86/609/EU. The
project was also approved by the regional committee on animal
ethics (CENOMEXA 1211-04). Rats were maintained in conventional housing, with access to food and water ad libitum, and kept
in a 12/12 h day/night cycle at 22 °C. To evaluate the impact of
unﬁlled LM-PAM on the fate of MSCs in vivo (study 1), 73 animals
were used, of which 49 were included for analysis (13.7% died
immediately following the reperfusion because of cerebral haemorrhage, 6.8% died during the second anaesthesia at 24 h postocclusion and 13.7% were excluded due to the inefﬁciency of the
occlusion). To analyse the effect of the MSCs/LM-PAMs releasing

VEGF on functional recovery (study 2), 60 animals were used, of
which 35 were included for analysis (13.3% died during the occlusion or at the reperfusion, 11.7% died during the ﬁrst 24 h because
of haemorrhagic transformation or malignant infarction and 18.3%
were excluded due to the inefﬁciency of the occlusion). The mortality rate was not different among groups after the administration
of the treatment (in study 1 the mortality rate was nil and in study
2 the log rank was 0.1). The experimental procedures are summarized in Fig. 1. In all studies, the experiments were performed randomly and the data were analysed in a blind manner.
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
Rats were anaesthetized with isoﬂurane (2–2.5%) in a mixture
of O2/N2O (30%/70%). A transient focal cerebral ischaemia was
induced by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
as described by Chuquet and colleagues [14]. Brieﬂy, a nylon ﬁlament (0.18 mm diameter) with a distal cylinder (0.38 mm diameter) was introduced into the lumen of the right external carotid
artery and then gently advanced into the internal carotid artery
up to the origin of the MCA. The success of the MCAo (reduction
of signal > 60%) was veriﬁed by a laser Doppler probe positioned
on the skull above the centre of the MCA area. One hour following
the occlusion, the rat was reanaesthetized and the reperfusion was
performed by removing the nylon thread. Throughout the procedure, the body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C, using a
feedback-controlled heating pad connected to a rectal probe. An
analgesic treatment (buprenorphine 5 mg kg1 i.m.) associated
with a rehydration (8 ml injection of saline i.p.) was delivered
every day for 3 days after the induction of ischaemia.
2.3. PAM formulation
Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres of an average
diameter of 60 lm were prepared by an emulsion solvent extraction–evaporation process, as previously described [13]. Formulation details are described in Supplementary 1. Four batches of
PAMs were employed for MSCs/LM-PAMs studies and two batches
for the MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF in vivo evaluation. The impact of
MSCs gene expression on PAMs was assessed using two batches
of PAMs.
2.4. LM-PAM characterization and VEGF release proﬁle
The yield of encapsulated VEGF within the LM-PAMs was determined by the measurement of the entrapped proteins based on the
ELISA kit for VEGF (R&D Systems, France). LM-PAMs–VEGF (5 mg)
was dissolved in 1 ml of acetone for 1 h, the entrapped protein
was separated by centrifugation (300 g.min1) and the acetone
was removed. This step was repeated and the pellet resuspended
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Controls performed with
unloaded LM-PAMs were negative in the ELISA assay. Only LMPAMs containing VEGF with a loading efﬁciency of at least 80%
were considered acceptable.
The in vitro release proﬁle of VEGF from LM-PAMs was determined from experiments (n = 3) by adding 250 ll of PBS buffer,
pH 7.4, containing 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), to 2.5 mg
of microspheres into tubes. The tubes were incubated in a shaking
water bath (37 °C, 125 rpm). At speciﬁed time intervals, the tubes
were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm and 250 ll of the supernatant was collected for analysis and replaced by fresh buffer. The
ratio of cumulative release (as a percentage) was calculated based
on the total amount of protein obtained from the encapsulation
yield. The released VEGF from LM-PAMs at different time points
was checked for bioactivity in a proliferation assay (alamarBlueÒ

assay, BIOSOURCE) with human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs), as previously described [13] (Supplementary 2).
2.5. Cell culture and adhesion to LM-PAMs
To prepare MSCs, three Sprague–Dawley rats were euthanized
and the femoral and tibial bone marrow was extracted. The bone
marrow was placed in a modiﬁcation of Eagle’s minimal essential
medium (a-MEM; Eurobio-AbCys, Courtaboeuf), supplemented
with 2 mM of glutamine (Sigma), 1% of streptomycin and penicillin
(Sigma) and 20% of foetal calf serum (FCS; Eurobio-AbCys, Courtaboeuf), for 24–48 h prior to being placed in the same medium containing 10% FCS, as previously described [15]. The cells were then
incubated at 37 °C in air enriched by CO2 (5%).
After 3–4 passages, MSCs were placed in contact with previously hydrated LM-PAMs for 4 h. MSCs were collected and
3  105 cells were mixed with 0.75 mg of LM-PAMs in a-MEM supplemented with 3% FCS. For in vitro studies, at the end of this contact period, the medium was withdrawn and replaced with a-MEM
supplemented with 2 mM of glutamine. Thereafter, the cell/LMPAM complexes were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
In study 1, implanted stem cells were prelabelled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to allow their follow-up. The BrdU (10 lM,
Sigma) was introduced into the medium daily 3 days before the
administration of MSCs, as previously described [16].
2.6. Administration of MSCs/LM-PAMs
To avoid the side effect of an early administration of VEGF, the
administration of MSCs/LM-PAMs with or without VEGF was performed at 24 h after MCAo. The anaesthetized rats were placed in
a stereotaxic head-holder and a sagittal scalp incision was performed. A 1 mm burr hole was drilled 3 mm lateral to the bregma.
The MSCs/LM-PAMs (3  105 cells and 0.75 PAMs in 8 ll of the
vehicle solution of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose–Tween
80–Mannitol (0.125, 0.125 and 0.5%, respectively), diluted 1/8 in

PBS) were infused into the striatum (6 mm depth) over 8 min via
a dental needle (30G) connected to a Hamilton syringe. The striatum is always affected by the ischaemic lesion in this model
[24]. Four groups were used in each study: vehicle, MSCs, MSCs/
LM-PAMs and LM-PAMs (study 1), and vehicle, MSCs, MSCs/LMPAMs and MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF (study 2). Animals were randomly assigned to each group following the behavioural test performed before MCAo.
2.7. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantiﬁcation of brain damage
At days 2 and 22 following MCAo, each animal was anaesthetized and completed an MRI examination (7T, PharmaScanÒ, Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany). T2 imaging was performed
with a RARE sequence (RARE factor of 8; TR/TE = 5000/16.25 ms;
NEX = 2; 20 contiguous slices; acquisition time = 4 min; resolution = 0.15  0.15  0.75 mm3). Images were analysed by in-house
macros based on ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
Abnormal areas were delineated by a semi-automatic technique
according to Letourneur and colleagues [17]. At day 2, the volume
of infarction was corrected for oedema as previously described
[18], and at day 22, brain damage was expressed as tissue atrophy
according to Leconte et al. [18].
2.8. Behavioural tests
To evaluate the functional recovery, the rats underwent a battery of behavioural tests in both the acute and chronic stages of
infarction according to the protocol shown in Fig. 1.
2.8.1. Neurological score
The neurological score was performed as previously described
[15]. For each item, a score of 0 (major deﬁcit), 1 (minor deﬁcit)
or 2 (no deﬁcit) was given. Spontaneous walking, circling towards
the paretic side and resistance against a lateral push were evaluated, as well as the ﬂexion of each limb and body rotation when

80

the experimenter suspended the rat by the tail sequentially by
each hand. A maximal score of 28 indicated normal sensorimotor
response [19].
2.8.2. Limb-placing test
The limb-placing test was performed according to De Ryck and
co-workers [20]. Vision, touch, proprioception and stimulation of
the vibrissae were examined for each side, as described in
Supplementary 3. A score of 0 (major deﬁcit), 1 (minor deﬁcit) or
2 (no deﬁcit) was applied for each item. The maximal score
obtained by a normal rat was 24 [19].
2.8.3. Corner test
The corner test was performed as described by Schallert and
collaborators [21] to evaluate the sensorimotor and postural asymmetries. The rat was placed in a corner composed of two vertical
boards (30  48 cm) ﬁxed on a horizontal surface with an open
angle of 30°. The criteria of rearing and returning in ipsilateral or
contralateral directions were noted. The test was repeated
10 times, with an inter-trial interval of 2 min.
2.8.4. Beam walking test
The test was performed according to Schallert and collaborators
[22], and is described in Supplementary 4.
2.8.5. Adhesive removal test
The adhesive removal test was described by Schallert and colleagues [21]. This test assesses the somatosensory neglect and
motor coordination of the rat by placing a 1  1 cm square of adhesive tape with equal pressure on the hairless plantar surface of
each forepaw. The animal was placed in a transparent Plexiglas
box (20  25  32 cm) and the time of contact and the time of
removal of the tape for each side were noted within a maximal period of 120 s [19].
2.9. Immunohistochemistry
Anesthetized rats were perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) solution at day 28 after
MCAo. The rats’ brains were removed and cut into 50 lm thick sections. For BrdU immunostaining, sections (2 or 3 per rat) from 4–6
rats in each group were incubated with the anti-BrdU antibody
(monoclonal rat anti-BrdU, Abcam 1/200), combined with the neuronal marker NeuN (monoclonal mouse anti-NeuN, Chemicon 1/
2000), the astrocytic marker glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (polyclonal
rabbit anti-GFAP, DAKO 1/5000) or the apoptotic marker caspase 3a
(polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase 3, Cell Signaling 1/250). Pictures

were performed on slices containing the PAM, i.e. between 0.26
and 0.80 mm of the bregma in reference to the Paxinos rat atlas.
To evaluate the effect of MSCs combined with LM-PAMs–VEGF
on neurogenesis and angiogenesis, sections were incubated with
the marker of immature neurons doublecortin (DCX; polyclonal
rabbit anti-DCX, Abcam 1/1000), the endothelial marker rat endothelial cell antigen (RECA-1; monoclonal mouse anti-RECA-1, AbD
Serotec 1/100) and the proliferation marker Ki67 (rabbit polyclonal
anti-Ki67 antibody, Abcam 1/200). The sections were incubated
overnight with the primary antibody in PBS with BSA (1%) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) at 4 °C. Next, sections were incubated for 2 h with
the appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa FluorÒ 555, 488, 1/
200) and the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Aldrich 1/
500) at room temperature. The DCX-labelled slices, and especially
all sections containing PAMs, were analysed by three different
observers. The labelling was scored as follows: 0: no labelling; 1:
light labelling; 2: moderate labelling; 3: dense labelling. With
respect to the Ki67/RECA-1 double labelling, pictures were
acquired using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000) after
exploration in the z-plane of the coextinction of the RECA-1 and
Ki67 labelling. Positive cells were expressed as a percentage of
Ki67-positive cells for all sections containing PAMs.
2.10. Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
The expressions of DCX, TUBB3, GFAP, VEGF-A, TGFb1, NGF and
BDNF were assessed by RT-qPCR, as described in Supplementary 3
and Table 1.
2.11. Statistical analyses
The JMPÒ software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and StatView
SE (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) were used for all statistical
analyses. The data were expressed as mean ± SD, or as
median ± interquartile range when appropriate. The infarct volume
and the impact of PAM on MSC outcome were analysed by a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a post hoc Fisher’s
protected least signiﬁcant difference (PLSD) test. Behavioural performances were analysed by ANOVA, or a repeated ANOVA when
necessary (neurological score, limb-placing test). The quantiﬁcation of the immunohistological staining was analysed by the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by a post hoc Mann–Whitney test when
more than two groups were compared, or by the Mann–Whitney
test when two groups were compared. Differences were considered
as signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. LM-PAMs–VEGF characterization and VEGF release proﬁle
The volume of the microspheres was a bell-shaped and uniform
distribution curve (mean diameter = 62 ± 5 lm) for each of the formulations performed, and a homogeneous distribution of laminin
on the surface of the PAMs was observed (Fig. 2A). The encapsulation yield of VEGF was 85 ± 23%. The cumulative release proﬁle
showed a burst of 12% at 1 week and 21% of the encapsulated VEGF
was released after 3 weeks (Fig. 2B). The in vitro proliferative assay
shown that VEGF collected from each sample of the kinetic release
assay (diluted to 4 ng ml1) was able to stimulate the proliferation

of HUVEC for a period of 5 days in a manner similar to that of
recombinant VEGF at 4 ng ml1 (data not shown). The cumulative
release curve of bioactive VEGF as a function of time is superimposable with that of the curve of VEGF, measured by ELISA
(Fig. 2B). All the proteins released were therefore bioactive.
3.2. LM-PAMs effects on MSCs outcome after MCAo
3.2.1. MRI quantiﬁcation of brain damage
In accordance with our working hypothesis, none of the treatments (MSCs, MSCs/LM-PAMs, LM-PAMs) administered 24 h after
the MCAo modiﬁed the size of the lesion in comparison to the vehicle (ANOVA p > 0.05 at days 2 and 22; Fig. 3A).

3.2.2. Outcome of MSCs associated with LM-PAMs after MCAo
The inﬂuence of LM-PAMs on the phenotype of MSCs was
assessed by analysing the expressions of GFAP and NeuN by MSCs
previously labelled with BrdU.
As shown in Fig. 3(B and C), the expression of the neuronal marker NeuN by the BrdU-positive cells was increased when the cells
were attached onto LM-PAMs (Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.04). The
expression of NeuN was 12% greater in MSCs conveyed by LMPAMs compared to MSCs alone. In contrast, double-labelled
BrdU/GFAP-positive cells were 3-fold less abundant when MSCs
were implanted with LM-PAMs compared with MSCs alone
(Fig. 3D; Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.08). These results indicate that
LM-PAMs increased the differentiation of MSCs into a neuronallike phenotype 28 days after their administration.
No signiﬁcant difference was found in the double-labelled
BrdU/caspase 3a-positive cells between the two groups (MSCs/
LM-PAMs compared to MSCs alone), which might imply that LM-

PAMs fail to modify the survival of the MSCs survival, at least at
28 days (data not shown).
3.2.3. Behavioural analyses
No signiﬁcant effect was observed with either neurological performance or sensorimotor function (Fig. 4). Since the graft of MSCs
on LM-PAMs increases the expression of the neuronal marker at
the expense of that of the glial marker in the ischaemic tissue
but without any signiﬁcant effect on functional recovery, we analysed if prolonged release of the neurogenic and angiogenic growth
factor VEGF-A could improve the efﬁciency of treatment in vivo.

3.3.2. Behavioural analyses
All the groups displayed similar neurological deﬁcits at day 1
following the occlusion (one-way ANOVA, no group effect,
p = 0.18; Fig. 6). The treatments (MSCs, MSCs/LM-PAMs and
MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF) failed to modify the evolution of the neurological score in comparison to the vehicle-treated rats (repeated
ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 6A).
In the limb-placing test, the performance in the different groups
did not differ at day 1 and no further signiﬁcant difference was
observed during the evaluation period. No effect was observed in

the corner test, beam walking test (data not shown) or adhesive
removal test. In the latter, the time to remove the adhesive tended
to be less in the MSCs/LM-PAMs-treated group (ANOVA p = 0.69
and p = 0.13 in the ipsi- and contralateral side, respectively;

the LM-PAMs appeared to be greater in the MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF
group compared to the other groups (Fig. 7B).
RECA-1 labelling, a marker of vascularization, was observed in
both LM-PAMs groups (MSCs/LM-PAMs and MSCs/LM-PAMs–
VEGF) at the site of administration (Fig. 8A). However, the RECA1 labelling was denser in the MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF group when
compared to the MSCs/LM-PAMs group, which might indicate that
VEGF, delivered by PAMs, assists in the vascularization of the
ischaemic tissue. The vascular network was less unstructured with
the MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF in comparison to the MSCs/LM-PAMs
treatment (Fig. 8B). To assess angiogenesis, a Ki67/RECA-1 double-labelling was performed in the MSCs/LM-PAMs and MSCs/
LM-PAMs–VEGF groups. As illustrated in Fig. 8C and D, an
increased number of Ki67/RECA-1-positive cells were observed
when VEGF was released by LM-PAMs compared with LM-PAMs
not releasing VEGF (Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.02).

face of the LM-PAMs. The LM-PAMs did not signiﬁcantly modify
the level of DCX mRNA expression by the MSCs (one-way ANOVA,
p = 0.13), although a slight increase was observed (Fig. 9B). The
LM-PAMs promoted the expression of TUBB3, a neuronal marker,
by MSCs in comparison to the same quantity of MSCs alone
(8.60 ± 4.10-fold, one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD,
p = 0.01; Fig. 9B). The adjunction of VEGF to the LM-PAMs had no
additional effect on the expression of this marker (8.00 ± 4.50-fold
compared to MSCs alone, ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD,
p = 0.02).
Interestingly, the expressions of VEGF-A, TGFb1 and BDNF were
increased by MSCs adhering to the LM-PAMs (one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD, p < 0.05) in comparison to MSCs alone at
the same density. The addition of VEGF to LM-PAMs had no additional effect (Fig. 9B). The presence of LM-PAMs with or without
VEGF failed to modify the expression of the NGF gene by MSCs
(data not shown).

inﬂuence the proﬁle of expression of neuronal markers and trophic
factors by MSCs. As presented in Fig. 9A and in accordance with
Delcroix and colleagues [9], the MSCs adhered strongly to the sur-

numerous preclinical studies [3]. Moreover, preliminary clinical
investigations have shown that the treatment of stroke patients
by MSCs is safe and efﬁcient [4]. The therapeutic capacities of MSCs
have been attributed mainly to their paracrine effects and modiﬁcations of immunological function [23]. However, the efﬁcacy of
treatment by MSCs may be limited by their low survival rate after
administration in ischaemic tissue [6].
The administration of stem cells with coated tridimensional
biopolymer-like microparticles promotes the differentiation and/
or survival of the cells so prepared [24,25]. Devices that deliver a
growth factor avoid the rapid degradation of cells in vivo and allow
a sustained release of the growth factor chosen, clearly enhancing
cell engraftment [8,26]. Therefore, to sustain the neuronal differentiation of MSCs, their survival and/or their paracrine function, we
developed a tissue engineering approach which combines MSCs
adhered onto PLGA microcarriers, LM-PAMs, designed to deliver
VEGF to the ischaemic tissue. For the ﬁrst time, the effectiveness
of microcarriers delivering a growth factor with MSCs in a sustained manner was analysed in a long-term study of the infarct
volume, functional recovery and endogenous cellular reactions
within the context and constraints of an animal model of stroke.
As expected, when the treatment was administered a long
time after the stroke, namely, 24 h after the occlusion, we failed
to detect any effect of the treatments on the lesion size. However,
we have demonstrated that MSCs, transplanted 24 h after stroke,
express markers of mature neurons (NeuN) – an effect which
increased when MSCs were attached to the LM-PAMs prior to
their administration. Of note, although BrdU can reduce prolifer-

ation of cells, perturb their differentiation and alter their senescence [27], we believe that it is among the best tools in our
study for identifying and following up MSCs in vivo. Indeed, to
avoid rejection of the cells and mimic clinical conditions, we used
MSCs cells from rats of the same strain, making it impossible to
use species-speciﬁc markers such as anti-HNA [8]. The rats used
in our study were limited to males in order to avoid any confounding effects of sexual hormones on infarct volume [28],
which render the identiﬁcation of MSCs by the chromosome Y
impossible. In addition, as explained by Harting et al. [29], the
use of a vector for MSCs identiﬁcation might be sensitive to
‘‘epigenic silencing’’. Finally, to our knowledge, the very few studies that have tracked MSCs in vivo for a long period [30,31], as in
our study, also used BrdU prelabelling cells.
These in vivo effects showing that LM-PAMs increase neuronal
marker expression by MSCs were also found in vitro at the mRNA
level, 24 h after their attachment to the LM-PAMs.
The results thus concord with previous in vitro reports which
showed that a subpopulation of human MSCs may differentiate
into neuronal-like cells following a four-step protocol based on a
combination of growth factors and that this differentiation is
potentiated by a laminin substrate [9]. No effect of LM-PAMs on
the survival of MSCs was observed 28 days after implantation,
although one cannot exclude that increased survival may have
occurred at earlier time points, as already reported in an ex vivo
and in vivo model of global ischaemia with ﬁbronectin-coated
PAMs [25]. One might assume thus that laminin in PAMs stimulated neuronal differentiation but not MSC survival.

86

M.-S. Quittet et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 15 (2015) 77–88

Nevertheless, this effect on neuronal differentiation was dissociated from a signiﬁcant improvement in functional recovery
regardless of the form of treatment applied. These ﬁndings fail
to replicate previous studies in which an improvement in functional recovery by MSCs was shown [3]. This discrepancy might
be related to the various origins of the cells (different tissue origin, different in vitro culture conditions and different species),
the time window of cell administration, the functional recovery
assessment or the amount of cells applied. Thus, we cannot
exclude the possibility that MSCs from different species or tissues, or the administration of a greater number of MSCs after
MCAo, may result in enhanced functional recovery. In addition,
we cannot exclude a potential later effect of the therapy which
would be observed after the ﬁrst month following the treatment.
In the rats treated with MSCs/LM-PAMs, the shorter time to
remove the adhesive from the ipsi- and contralateral sides and
the increased expression of neuronal markers by MSCs together
encourage further studies on the usefulness of LM-PAMs as a
biomimetic support in models of focal cerebral ischaemia and,
eventually, in stroke itself.
Another important point to be considered for the implantation of MSCs in an injured organ is the formation of a competent
vasculature. It is obligatory that, during the repair of ischaemic
tissue, there be an appropriate angiogenesis. The recruitment
of endothelial cells in the brain depends, notably, on the VEGFA gradient [32]. Accordingly, and in order to better understand
the formation of a restructured vasculature around the site of
implantation of MSCs, we investigated the actions of LM-PAMs
loaded with the angiogenic factor VEGF-A, which is known to
be a neurogenic factor [33] and to favour the survival of MSCs
[13]. When MSCs were attached to the LM-PAMs–VEGF, we
showed that the proliferation of endothelial cells at the site of
implantation, as assessed by double-labelling with Ki67 and
RECA-1, is increased compared to the MSCs/LM-PAMs group.
Moreover, with the MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF, we observed a more
structured vasculature than that seen in the MSCs/LM-PAMs
group. These results are in accordance with those of Bible and
colleagues [8], who found that the encapsulation of VEGF-A in
microcarriers associated with human NSCs promotes the recruitment of host endothelial cells into the lesion cavity. Our results
are also in line with those of Gutiérrez-Fernández and colleagues
[34], who found that the administration of MSCs increases VEGF
expression along with vascular density in the peri-infarct zone
14 days after the induction of stroke. Interest in combining MSCs
with VEGF has been further strengthened by the report that
MSCs-mediated VEGF gene transfer in rats is active in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease [35].
Other than angiogenesis, MSCs have been shown to induce neurogenesis within the context of ischaemia [3]. In addition to being
one of the archetypical angiogenic factors, VEGF-A is also recognized for its neurogenic properties [36]. Based on these features,
we hypothesized that the use of LM-PAMs loaded with VEGF-A
would increase peri-lesional neurogenesis. We observed that the
MSCs/LM-PAMs–VEGF treatment evidenced the labelling of immature neurons in the SVZ, with a sprouting directed towards the
ischaemic core, unlike MSCs/LM-PAMs alone. We observed in the
in vitro studies that LM-PAMs increase the expression of BDNF
mRNA by the MSCs. BDNF is widely recognized to be a neurotrophic factor that plays a key role in the survival of nascent neurons,
migration and synaptic plasticity [37]. The BDNF produced by
MSCs may reinforce the migration of immature neurons from the
SVZ towards the ischaemic lesion. We showed that the expression
of TGFb1 mRNA by the MSCs is likewise increased in the presence
of LM-PAMs. The beneﬁcial role of TGFb1 in neuronal survival,
inﬂammatory reactions and neurogenesis [38] suggests that this
factor is an additional, advantageous paracrine factor secreted by

the MSCs in brain tissue suffering from local hypoxia. Interestingly,
Yoo and colleagues [39] have shown that MSC-secreted TGF-b
plays a crucial role in the ability of MSCs to attenuate the severity
of immune reactions in the ischaemic brain. Since our ﬁrst goal
was to improve the beneﬁcial effects of MSCs, we focused on the
impact of combinatorial strategies: MSCs conveyed by LM-PAMs
or by LM-PAMs releasing VEGF, compared to MSCs alone. However,
we cannot exclude that LM-PAMs–VEGF might have a beneﬁcial
effect by themselves, although Bible and colleagues [8] did not
report any effect of PAMs–VEGF not combined with cells in their
study.
While our initial studies on endogenous neurogenesis and
angiogenesis hold promise, the association of MSCs with LMPAMs–VEGF failed to be sufﬁcient to induce meaningful effects
on functional recovery, at least as deﬁned by our measures of
sensorimotor function. We have accentuated the possibility of
delivering LM-PAMs–VEGF to the ischaemic striatum without
side-effects despite the important mass of LM-PAMs engrafted.
In a previous study, the efﬁcacy of VEGF released by LM-PAMs
on the survival of MSCs after hypoxia/reoxygenation was demonstrated [13]; however, in vivo, the released VEGF is forcibly
decreased due to the slower degradation rate of the microcarriers. The implantation of MSCs associated with microcarriers
releasing a more important quantity of VEGF and without sideeffects within the context of stroke is a challenge for the future.
To this end, PLGA–P188–PLGA, for which we have recently
reported the capacity to deliver 70% of the total TGF-b3 loaded,
appears to be a solid candidate [40].
Finally, although the size of the PAM might be a limitation of
the treatment, translating it to stroke patients should not be
impossible once the approach has been validated in different
experimental models of brain ischaemia and in different animal
species. Although intracerebral administration of PAMs may carry
some risks, such surgical approach is already performed for the
implantation of MSCs in stroke patients or electrodes in deep brain
structure in patients with Parkinson’s disease or central poststroke patients [41–43]. Moreover, since this approach targets
the sub-acute stage of stroke to enhance repair/regeneration, the
timing of administration would not be a major constraint, unlike
in acute therapies such as thrombolysis.

5. Conclusion
The association of drug delivery systems with biodegradable
microcarriers is a unique tool for supporting stem cells and represents a cogent strategy for cell therapy in stroke. There are substantial arguments that the delivery of a speciﬁc growth factor
and/or the coating substrate may enhance cell survival and differentiation. Even though the efﬁcacy of LM-PAMs holds promise for
the facilitation of the differentiation of MSCs into those of a neuronal phenotype as well as for promoting the secretion of neurotrophic factors, this efﬁcacy is insufﬁcient, at least under the
conditions developed in this study, since we were unable to meaningfully enhance functional recovery after a massive cerebral
ischaemia in the rat. In 2007, biodegradable microparticles delivering two different molecules were demonstrated to be an effective
approach to enhancing the development of an immune response
[44]. Since the LM-PAMs could encapsulate more than one growth
factor, according to the literature and the results obtained in vitro,
the encapsulation of VEGF-A in association with BDNF could be a
route to further ameliorate regeneration (angiogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis) within the ischaemic volume, the functional outcome of administered MSCs and, concomitantly, to
further intensify the rate and importance of the functional recovery in focal cerebral ischaemia.
