Abstract
Ischemic stroke is currently treated with thrombolytic therapy with a drawback to induce hemorrhagic transformation (HT) if
applied beyond its relatively narrow treatment time window. The present study was designed to examine the role of IMM-H004, a
derivative of coumarin, in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced HT. Rats subjected to 6 h of thromboembolic
occlusion or middle cerebral artery occlusion received tPA with or without IMM-H004. Delayed tPA intervention drastically
increased the risk of HT and exaggerated the ischemic injury. To assess the effect of IMM-H004 on delayed treatment of
tPA-induced toxicity after ischemia and reperfusion, various approaches were used, including a behavior test, TTC-staining, determination of cerebral hemorrhage, laser speckle imaging, Western blot, gelatin zymogram, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. Experiments were also conducted in vitro in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and PC12
cells to explore the mechanism for the role of IMM-H004. Combination therapy of tPA and IMM-H004 prevented the development
of HT, and reduced the mortality rate, infarct volume and brain edema. IMM-H004 also exerted a protective role by decreasing
matrix metalloproteinases, the co-localization of matrix metalloproteinase-2 with astrocytes and increasing occludin. Experiments
in HBMECs and PC12 revealed an elevation in ATP level and a protein kinase A- and PI3K-dependent activation of Akt by IMMH004 after tPA administration. These results suggest IMM-H004 as a promising adjuvant to alleviate the detrimental side effects
of tPA in clinical therapy of ischemic stroke, and contribute to better understand the mechanism for the beneficial role of this
novel remedy.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a cerebral vascular disease with high morbidity
and mortality (Lo et al., 2003). To date, thrombolytic therapy
remains the commonly used therapy for patients with ischemic
stroke, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the
only FDA-approved drug for clinical application. However, it is
widely recognized that thrombolytic therapy is beneﬁcial within 3–
4.5 h after ischemic onset (Hacke et al., 2008). Once beyond the
time window, tPA treatment is associated with high incidences of
side effects. There are two mechanisms for the detrimental roles of
tPA. The ﬁrst is that tPA might lead to the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), promoting the degradation of extracellular
matrix components (Liotta et al., 1981; Carmeliet et al., 1997;

Lijnen et al., 1998), of which MMP-9 plays a role mainly in the
acute phase (Planas et al., 2001), especially in hemorrhagic transformation (HT) (Rosell et al., 2008). Romanic et al. (1998) reported
that after brain ischemia in rats the activity of MMP-9 signiﬁcantly
increases at 12 h and peaks by 24 h, then gradually returns to basal
level. tPA-mediated MMP-9 activation might aggregate acute blood
brain barrier (BBB) injury and increase the risk of HT. The second
mechanism is the functional damage to microvessels, which is
related directly to blood supply to the infarct area after thrombolysis
(Montrucchio et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999). Vascular stabilization is required for efﬁcient vascularization (Hirschi et al., 1997).
Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) has been reported to reduce endothelial permeability and enhance vascular stabilization through its receptor
tyrosine kinase (Tie-2) during the sub-acute and chronic phase of
ischemic injury (Suri et al., 1998; Patan, 2004). An alternative remedy is appealing as an adjuvant with a potential both to reduce BBB
permeability and to enhance angiogenesis after tPA treatment.

Coumarin compounds are an important class of organic heterocyclic compounds. Independent of its anticoagulant activity, researchers have found that coumarins have multi-biological activities
(Fylaktakidou et al., 2004). For example, coumarin derivatives have
been reported to reduce edema and inﬂammation by interfering in
the generation of reactive oxygen species (Fylaktakidou et al.,
2004). In addition, increasing evidence indicates that they may exert
anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects via inhibiting microglia activation and cyclooxygenase-2. Through a series of screening
and continuous structural optimization, we identiﬁed a new small
molecule, 3-piperazinylcoumarin (IMM-H004), from coumarin. Our
previous studies showed that IMM-H004 could block the calcium
mobilization and chemotaxis induced by CKLF1-C27 (Li et al.,
2010), reduce the toxicity of Ab by improving the mitochondrial
function (Song et al., 2013), inhibit the release of inﬂammatory factors and decrease the inﬂammatory response in mice, thereby
improving BBB function (Li et al., 2013). However, no study has
been published so far regarding the potential of IMM-H004 to attenuate the toxicity of delayed tPA therapy in stroke. The present study
examines the role of IMM-H004 in tPA-induced toxicity, especially
HT, both in a realistic thromboembolic model and in a stable transient brain ischemic model, and further investigated the mechanisms
in vitro.

Materials and methods
Drug
IMM-H004 was provided by the Department of Chemosynthesis,
Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
& Peking Union Medical College (Beijing, China). Its chemical
structure is shown in Fig. 1.

a PE-50 catheter was inserted into the ECA and advanced to the
bifurcation of the carotid artery. The right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was occluded by injecting the autologous blood clots into
the ICA. After 6 h TE of MCA, the rats were treated with either
tPA alone, or tPA plus IMM-H004, or vehicle (saline), as detailed
below. The second model used in this study was middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) for simulation of the clinical situation of
tPA thrombolysis (Yamashita et al., 2009). The MCAO model was
prepared exactly as described by Ji et al. (2009). Brieﬂy, the rats
(260–280 g) were anesthetized with 4% choral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
i.p.), and the ECA, ICA and pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were
exposed, respectively. A nylon suture (Sunbio Bioteck, Beijing,
China) with a diameter of 0.38 mm (Sunbio Bioteck) was inserted
via ECA, advanced to 18–19 mm distance and maintained there for
6 h, then withdrawn for reperfusion. Rats that showed convulsions
or sustained consciousness disturbances or no apparent contralateral
limb dysfunction were excluded from subsequent experiments. The
animals in the sham group underwent the identical procedure except
for occlusion of the ICA.
Animal treatment
Rats were randomly assigned to different groups and all the experiments were double-blinded. In the tPA group, rats received a bolus
of tPA (10 mg/kg in 1 mL saline, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim
am Rhein, Germany) intravenously at 6 h after TE focal cerebral
ischemia (in the TE model) or immediately before reperfusion (in
the MCAO model). In the tPA + IMM-H004 group, rats received
tPA (10 mg/kg in 1 mL saline) and IMM-H004 (6 mg/kg in 1 mL
saline) intravenously at the same time points as in the tPA group.
Rats assigned to the vehicle group or IMM-H004 group received
1 mL saline (vehicle group) or IMM-H004 (6 mg/kg in 1 mL saline, in IMM-H004 group) alone in the same manner.

Animal models
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided by Vital River (Beijing,
China). All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and were in accordance with the principles outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. Two animal models were
established and used in the present study. The ﬁrst was the rat
thromboembolic (TE) model (Busch et al., 1997) for evaluating if
IMM-H004 prevents tPA post-treatment-induced HT after focal cerebral ischemia. For this, animals weighing 300–320 g were anesthetized with 4% choral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p). Blood was collected
from the femoral artery and vein and transferred to a PE-50 catheter.
After the blood was coagulated, clots were isolated and cut into
pieces 1.5 mm long and 0.35 mm wide under a microscope. Twelve
pieces of clotted blood were then drawn into a 15-cm-long PE-50
catheter. During preparation of clots, the rat right external carotid
artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and pterygopalatine artery
of the ICA were exposed, and the common carotid artery (CCA) was
temporarily closed. Following ligation of the pterygopalatine artery,

Cell culture
Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs, a gift from
Dr G. H. Du, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking
Union Medical College) were cultured in Dulbecco’s minimal Eagle
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and 5% equine serum (ES) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY,
USA). When the cells reached 80–90% conﬂuence, the medium was
discarded. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
twice, the cells were incubated with tPA (10, 30, 100, 300 lg/mL)
either alone or plus IMM-H004 (0.1, 1, 10 lM) for 24 h. In another
set of experiments, cells were exposed to tPA (10, 30, 100, 300 lg/
mL), IMM-H004 (0.1, 1 10 lM) and dibutyryladenosine 30 50 -cyclic
monophosphate sodium salt (db-cAMP, 1000 lM, Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA), PKAI (1 lM, Sigma-Aldrich) or LY294002
(10 lM, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h.
Neurological function
Behavior deﬁcits were determined on days 1, 2 and 3 after TE focal
cerebral ischemia (in the TE model) or on days 1–7 after ischemia
and reperfusion (I/R; in the MCAO model), using the Ludmila Belayev test (Belayev et al., 1996), grid test (Dang et al., 2011), wire
grip latency and beam walk. The Ludmila Belayev test was graded
0–12, with 12 representing the severest deﬁcits. In grid tests, the
times of forelimb felling within 1 min were scored to evaluate neurological deﬁcits. For the wire grip latency, grasping time was

motor coordination.

incubated at 37 °C with a developing buffer for 22 h. Gels were
stained with coomassie blue and then destained and qualiﬁed. A
mixture of human MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA,
USA) was utilized as standard (STD) control.

TTC staining

Western blotting analysis

Rats were transcardially perfused with PBS on day 1 (TE model) or
day 7 (MCAO model), and brains were removed and cut into six 2mm-thick consecutive sections followed by staining with 1.5% 5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, T8877) (Paumard
et al., 2002). The infarct and edema volume was analysed using the
IPP software.

Seven days after I/R, animals in the MCAO model were transcardially perfused with PBS and brains were removed. The ischemic
cortex tissues were dissected quickly on ice and stored at 80 °C
until use. The cells from cell cultures were collected and washed
twice with PBS. Lysis buffer was added to the tissues or the cells
collected followed by homogenization at 12 000 g for 30 min at
4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay, and
the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was
blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies applied
included anti-occludin (1 : 500, sc-5562), anti-Tie-2 (1 : 1000, sc324), anti-Ang-1 (1 : 1000, sc-6319), anti-p-Akt (1 : 800, sc-8312),
anti-Akt (1 : 500, sc-5298) and anti-b-actin (1 : 10 000, Sigma)
antibodies. The membrane was then washed three times in PBS followed by incubating with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1 : 5000, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The
protein bands were analysed by enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL). Densitometry analysis of the protein was conducted using
QUANTITY ONE 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Assessment of cerebral hemorrhage
Cerebral hemorrhage was surveyed on brain slices from rats in different groups. To quantitatively assess cerebral hemorrhage volume
of the rats in different conditions, a standard curve was ﬁrst constructed. For this, brain tissues were removed from normal rats
under anesthesia, and different volumes of homologous blood were
added to the samples followed by homogenization with a Dounce
homogenizer. Then, 150 lL of homogenate from each sample was
sonicated for 30 s on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min (14 000 g,
4 °C). Eighty microliters of supernatant was added to reaction
reagent (320 lL) in the Hemoglobin Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems,
Hayward, CA, USA). After 5 min, the optical density of each sample was measured at 400 nm and a line was plotted showing the linear relationship between the blood volume and hemoglobin
concentration. The same amount of brain tissue was collected from
the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere of the rats in
different conditions, and processed for homogenization with PBS,
sonication and centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was used for
determination of hemoglobin concentration, and hemorrhage volume
in each condition was derived by comparison with the standard
curve (Liu et al., 2009).
Laser speckle imaging
Laser speckle imaging was carried out for the MCAO model at the
onset of ischemia, immediately after reperfusion and 7 days after
reperfusion, using PeriCam PSI (Perimed, Beijing, China). For this,
each rat was anesthetized with 4% choral hydrate, and the skull skin
was opened and skull was cleaned by using a scalpel. The exposure
area was kept clean and dry using a tampon during image collection.
The PeriCam PSI head was adjusted to ensure that the red cross
point of the indicator laser (660 nm) was located at the center of the
brain, and the measurement distance was ﬁxed at 10 cm. Adjustment of the size of the test area was performed by PIM Software version 1.5. Cerebral blood ﬂow signals were collected at 785 nm and
transferred into blood perfusion images using PIM Software.
Assessment of MMP-9 expression
Expression of MMP-9 was assessed using a gelatin zymogram (Liu
et al., 2009) 24 h after I/R in the MCAO model. Brieﬂy, rats were
transcardially perfused with PBS and the brains removed quickly.
The cerebral cortex tissues were isolated and homogenized
(13 201 g for 30 min) at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay, and 50 lg protein was loaded onto 10%
Tris-glycine gels with 1 mg/mL gelatin. Following electrophoresis,
gels were placed in 2.5% Triton X-100 washing out SDS, and then

Immunohistochemistry
Animals in the MCAO model were transcardially perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS 24 h after I/R, brains were removed, and
4-lm-thick parafﬁn-embedded slices were prepared and processed
for immunohistochemistry. The sections were treated with microwaves for antigen retrieval and washed with PBST (PBS plus 0.2%
Triton-X). Subsequently, sections were blocked using 10% goat
serum and then incubated overnight with primary antibody against
MMP-9 (1 : 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) at 4 °C. Following washing in PBST three times, sections
were incubated with HRP-goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1 : 100, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature and reveled by DAB (ZSGB-Bio, Beijing, China). Images were
captured using a microscope, the numbers of positive cells were
scored in ten randomly selected images of ischemic hemisphere and
the result was expressed as the number of positive cells per image,
using IMAGE-PRO PLUS 6.0.
Immunofluorescence staining
The brains from animals in the MCAO model were collected 7 days
after 6 h I/R and processed for parafﬁn sectioning. Ischemic cerebral
cortex sections were submitted to antigen retrieval by microwave
and blockage with normal donkey serum, sequentially, and incubated with primary antibody to CD31 (1 : 100, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes in PBST, the sections were
incubated with either a secondary antibody Alexa 488-conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit for detection of CD31+, or anti-rat IgG. In
another set of experiments, slices were incubated with primary antibody against CD31+ and Ki-67 (1 : 100, a marker for mitosis cells,
Santa Cruz), simultaneously, followed by incubation with Alexa 488conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa 594-conjugated
donkey anti-goat antibody (1 : 100, Invitrogen). The number of

positive cells was counted in ten randomly selected images of
ischemic hemisphere under an upright ﬂuorescence microscope
(Leica DFC420, Wetzlar, Germany), and the result was expressed as
the number of positive cells per image.
Determination of LDH and ATP
After treatment with different drugs, the conditioned media of
HBMECs and PC12 were collected separately and then determined
by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; a marker of non-speciﬁc cell
damage) assay kit (Nanjing jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
China). Data were obtained at 440 nm using a microplate reader
(Multiscan Go, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
To measure the level of ATP, the medium were discarded and lysis
buffer was then added to the plates. The level of ATP was measured
using an ATP kit (Nanjing jiancheng Bioengineering Institute)
strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence
was obtained using a lumicount microplate reader (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SEM. In most cases, statistical analysis was obtained by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) post-hoc
A

Newman–Keuls analysis for multiple comparisons with SPSS. For
comparison of hemorrhage volumes between ischemic hemispheres
and non-ischemic hemispheres, a paired t-test was performed with
SPSS. For comparison of the mortality between tPA and vehicle or
the combination therapy, a v2 test was performed with SPSS.
P < 0.05 was set as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
IMM-H004 attenuates tPA-mediated toxicity in a TE model
In the rat TE model, IMM-H004 and tPA were given 6 h after
ischemia onset, as detailed above. Figure 2A shows the rat brain
slices from various groups, demonstrating that no visible bleeding
was observed in non-ischemic hemispheres in all groups, while an
obvious bleeding occurred in the ischemic hemisphere in the model
group, as well as in the tPA group. IMM-H004 administration
reduced cerebral bleeding remarkably in response to tPA (Fig. 2C,
P < 0.01, F3,20 = 5.09), and IMM-H004 per se caused no bleeding.
Quantiﬁcation of the hemoglobin concentration of the ischemic
hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere derived by comparison
with the standard curve (Fig. 2B) from rats in each condition conﬁrmed the survey results (Fig. 2C). All rats treated with tPA alone
died in the ﬁrst 3 days because of severe hemorrhage and ischemic

TE model, IMM-H004 efﬁciently inhibited tPA-mediated HT
(Fig. 4H, P < 0.05, F3,20 = 4.87) and exaggeration of infarct volume (Fig. 4G, P < 0.05, F3,20 = 3.24). Moreover, mortality was
also decreased by IMM-H004 administration (Fig. 4I, P < 0.05,
F3,56 = 4.18). Notably, overall mortality in the MCAO model was
lower than that in the TE model, suggesting that the cerebral injury
in the TE model was greater than that in the MCAO model or that
tPA thrombolysis itself had a detrimental effect.

infarction, consistent with previous reports (Wang et al., 1998; Nagai et al., 1999; Nicole et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Cheng et al.,
2006). By contrast, the tPA + IMM-H004 animals had a signiﬁcantly lower mortality as compared with the tPA group (Fig. 2D,
P < 0.05, F3,56 = 4.13). The tPA group showed more severe neurological deﬁcits than the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Of note,
a combination therapy with tPA + IMM-H004 recovered neurological function signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3A–D, P < 0.01, F3,56 = 4.20). Histological examination was conducted 1 day after TE ischemia,
showing that a combination therapy with tPA + IMM-H004 reduced
the ischemic infarction (Fig. 3E and F, P < 0.01, F3,20 = 4.76) as
well as cerebral edema (Fig. 3E and G, P < 0.01, F3,20 = 4.82).
Interestingly, IMM-H004 alone displayed a beneﬁcial role in ischemia-induced cerebral infarction and edema (P < 0.01). Taken
together, IMM-H004 effectively inhibited tPA-mediated HT and
aggravation in cerebral infarct and edema, lowering mortality and
improving neurological function.

IMM-H004 attenuates tPA-mediated toxicity through
decreasing BBB permeability in the acute phase of ischemic
injury
To explore the causes responsible for the beneﬁcial role of IMMH004, we examined the expression of MMPs in brain at 24 h after 6 h
transient MCAO by gelatin zymography, which is known to play a
key role in disrupting the BBB. As shown in Fig. 5A, compared with
the vehicle group, tPA signiﬁcantly increased the expression of
pro-MMP-9 (Fig. 5C, P < 0.05, F2,6 = 5.79), but had no signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the expression of active-MMP-9, possibly because the
examining time was too early to detect active-MMP-9. Administration
of IMM-H004 along with tPA suppressed the enhanced expression of
pro-MMP-9 by tPA (Fig. 5A and C, P < 0.05). By contrast, tPA treatment increased the expression of both pro-MMP-2 and active-MMP2, which was decreased by IMM-H004 addition (Fig. 5A and D,
P < 0.05, F2,6 = 10.9). Consistent with the gel gelatin zymograhy,
immunohistochemistry results showed a similar change of MMP-9 at
24 h after 6 h transient MCAO in different groups (Fig. 5B,
P < 0.01, F4,25 = 4.37). Of note, the changes in MMP-9 were parallel
to the extent of hemorrhage. It is well known that MMP-2 is secreted
by endothelial cells and attacks components of the BBB, including
tight junctions between endothelial cells, basement membrane and
astrocyte endfeet. Fluorescent double-labeling showed a colocalization
of MMP-2 and astrocytes (Fig. 6A and C, P < 0.01), but not neurons
(Fig. 6B and C), upon tPA administration, which was apparently
reduced in the tPA + IMM-H004 group (P < 0.01). Furthermore,

IMM-H004 attenuates tPA-mediated toxicity in an MCAO
model
In this model, tPA was administered before reperfusion at 6 h after
MCAO to imitate tPA thrombolysis in the clinic. As shown in
Fig. 4A, rats in the vehicle group showed a time-dependent body
weight loss after I/R with a rebound starting from day 5. Rats in the
tPA group showed a more prominent weight loss, lowest on day 5,
without rebound (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Treatment with tPA + IMMH004 alleviated the weight loss signiﬁcantly compared with the
vehicle group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). All groups showed severe neurological deﬁcits at 24 h after I/R (Fig. 4B–E, P < 0.05, P < 0.01)
but neurological function began to recover spontaneously over the
following days. tPA treatment severely exaggerated the neurological
deﬁcits compared with vehicle from 1 to 7 days after I/R (P < 0.05,
P < 0.01). By contrast, tPA + IMM-H004 treatment and IMM-H004
per se signiﬁcantly improved the neurological function compared
with vehicle (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Similar to the effect found in the

Western blotting results showed that administration of tPA signiﬁcantly reduced occludin levels at 24 h after 6 h transient MCAO compared with vehicle (P < 0.05). This tPA-evoked reduction in occludin
was prevented by addition of IMM-H004 (Fig. 6D and E, P < 0.01,
F4,10 = 7.01). These results demonstrated that in the acute injury
stage, IMM-H004 might suppress tPA-mediated HT by decreasing the
expression of MMP-9/MMP-2, thus protecting the integrity of the
BBB.
IMM-H004 attenuates tPA-mediated toxicity through improving
the integrity of vascular endothelial cells in the chronic phase
of ischemic injury
Several animal studies on focal cerebral ischemia have shown that
the development of HT after tPA treatment is correlated with I/Rinduced endothelial injury (Wang et al., 2004). Thus, we further
explored the role of microvascular endothelial cells in the beneﬁcial
effect of IMM-H004 on HT induced by tPA at 7 days after 6 h transient MCAO. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that treatment with
tPA + IMM-H004 signiﬁcantly increased the length and number of
CD31+-positive structures in the ischemic penumbra 7 days after I/R

compared with vehicle and tPA alone (Fig. 7A–C, P < 0.01,
F3,20 = 4.94). Correspondingly, decreased IgG leakage was observed
in the tPA + IMM-H004 group, as compared with the tPA group,
implying improved BBB integrity (Fig. 7A, B and D, P < 0.01,
F3,20 = 7.39). IMM-H004 treatment also increased CD31+/Ki67+positive cells (Fig. 8A–C, P < 0.01, F3,20 = 5.8). Ki67+ is known
as a marker of cell proliferation (Breunig et al., 1997). Increased
colocalization of CD31+ and Ki67+ in the tPA + IMM-H004 group
indicated that IMM-H004 promoted the mitosis of endothelial cells.
In line with this result, expression of the angiogenic growth factor
Ang-1 (P < 0.01, F3,8 = 9.85) and its receptor Tie-2 (P < 0.01,
F3,8 = 7.59) also decreased after tPA administration but was signiﬁcantly reversed by IMM-H004 addition (Fig. 8C and D). To investigate the functional signiﬁcance of the improvement in
microvasculature by IMM-H004 we performed in vivo laser speckle
imaging to detect perfusion efﬁciency (Fig. 9A). The result demonstrated a remarkably decreased cerebral blood supply in the vehicle
group during the ischemia phase with recovery after reperfusion but
then fell again 7 days after I/R (P < 0.001, P < 0.05). A similar
dynamic alteration in cerebral blood perfusion was observed in the
tPA alone group (P < 0.001, P < 0.05). Notably, overall perfusion

increased in the ischemic penumbra by IMM-H004 intervention
compared with the tPA alone group (P < 0.05, F2,15 = 3.68).
Together, these results suggested that IMM-H004 was able to promote vascularization and thus improve cerebral perfusion, which
was, at least in part, responsible for the potential of IMM-H004 to
attenuate tPA-elicited side effects.
The effect and mechanism of tPA and IMM-H004 on cell
culture
The tPA-induced damage in HBMECs and PC12 cells was ﬁrst
examined using LDH release as an indicator of cell injury. In both
type of cells, tPA at 10, 30 and 100 mg/mL had no effect on the
cells (data not shown), but damaged cells signiﬁcantly at 300 mg/
mL (data not shown) This tPA-induced damage was attenuated in
HBMECs by addition of IMM-H004 in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 10A, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, F7,16 = 3.09). The dose of
IMM-H004 used in this experiment was based on our previous
research (Song et al., 2013). While in PC12, IMM-H004 did not act
at < 10 lM (Fig. 10A and B, P < 0.01, F4,10 = 6.72). Interestingly,
db-cAMP, a cAMP analog, exhibited a protective effect on tPA-treated HBMEC injury (P < 0.01). db-cAMP (Fig. 10A), as with IMMH004, suggested that an cATP shortage occurred in tPA-treated
cells, while IMM-H004 (1 and 10 lM) had a potential to elevate
cATP level. Studies have shown that cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)
and PI3K/Akt signaling are involved in mediation of tight junction
and BBB (Zhang et al., 2012). Thus, we further investigated the
effect of tPA and IMM-H004 on these signals. Western blotting
revealed that tPA (300 mg/mL) considerably decreased the phosphorylation of Akt (P < 0.05), which was prevented by IMM-H004
(10 lM, P < 0.01, F4,10 = 5.99). The potential of IMM-H004 to prevent tPA-elicited Akt dephosphorylation was almost abolished by
addition of PKAI (a PKA inhibitor, P < 0.01) or LY294002 (a
PI3K inhibitor, P < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of cAMP/
PKA and PI3K/Akt signaling in the role of IMM-H004.

Discussion
Tissue plasminogen activator is, although effective, feasible only for
< 5% of patients due to its narrow time window (Zivin et al., 1985;

Overgaard et al., 1992; Jiang et al., 2000). Delayed treatment of
tPA has a high risk of development of HT and brain edema, ﬁnally
leading to elevated mortality (Alberts, 1997; Mohr, 2000; Lapchak,
2002; Yepes et al., 2003). Therefore, strategies to prevent the toxicity induced by delayed treatment of tPA are needed. Combination
with IMM-H004 might effectively prolong the time window of tPA
in clinical application. To simulate the clinical condition, in the
present study we ﬁrst prepared a TE model by injection of a selfprepared clot into the MCA and using this model evaluated the risk
of HT in the presence of tPA alone or tPA + IMM-H004. The result
showed that the animals treated with tPA at 6 h after ischemia all
died within the ﬁrst 3 days because of severe bleeding. By contrast,
IMM-H004 enhanced the survival rate and promoted behavior
recovery. However, this TE model has the disadvantage of instability. Therefore, we adopted another model to mimic thrombolytic
injury induced by delayed administration of tPA after 6 h ischemia,
a time point that is beyond the 3–4.5 h time window of tPA. Likewise, IMM-H004 was observed in this model to be able to reduce
the mortality of rats and prevent the deterioration of neurological
deﬁcit after tPA treatment, suggesting a potential of IMM-H004 to
alleviate the cerebral injury induced by tPA-delayed treatment.
Additionally, IMM-H004 reversed the aggravated injury induced by
delayed tPA treatment such as infarction and edema.
Hemorrhagic transformation presents as a major detrimental side
effect of delayed tPA thrombolysis therapy. Noticeably, IMM-H004
administration alleviated tPA-elicited cerebral hemorrhage as well as
edema, both of which may be attributable to BBB disruption. The
BBB consists of vascular endothelial cells, basement membrane and
astrocyte endfeet, while MMPs are known to play a crucial role in
disrupting the BBB due to their ability to digest endothelial basal
lamina (Zhao et al., 2009). Among MMPs, MMP-9/MMP-2 have
been reported as the main proteins responsible for tPA-induced complications (Sumii & Lo, 2002). Consistent with these results, the
present study found that treatment with tPA at 6 h after I/R signiﬁcantly induced the expression of MMP-9 compared with the vehicle
group. Importantly, the tPA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 was
prevented by treatment with IMM-H004. A similar change occurred
in MMP-2. Interestingly, occludin, the major protein of tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells, underwent an alteration in
different groups in a reverse order to MMPs, implying tight

junctions as one of the targets for MMPs, in accordance with the
results from Zhang et al. (2012) showing that occludin is a substrate
for MMP-9/MMP-2. These results, along with the fact that IMMH004 reduced tPA-elicited colocalization of MMP2 and astrocytes
and IgG leakage, suggest that one of the beneﬁcial roles of IMMH004 is to protect against tPA-enhanced expression of MMPs, thus
attenuating BBB disruption.
Studies have shown that angiogenesis emerges in the ischemic
region after vascular occlusion and contributes to improvements following infarction, blood ﬂow and neuronal recovery (Meenakshisundaram et al., 2008). Clinically, patients with high vascular density
have relatively lower mortality and longer survival time (Chen
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004). However, in the pathological state,
spontaneous angiogenesis is not active enough to compensate for
the damage caused by ischemia. We assumed that one of the roles
of IMM-H004 in protecting against tPA complication may reside in
promoting angiogenesis. Our data demonstrated that microvessel
loss after I/R was aggravated by tPA treatment, which was protected
by IMM-H007. In addition, endothelial cell proliferation and expression of angiogenic growth factor Ang-1 and its receptor Tie-2 were
enhanced by IMM-H004 intervention, implying an increment of
sprouting angiogenesis, although the possibility that IMM-H004 promotes vessel formation via endothelial progenitor cells cannot be
precluded (Arenillas et al., 2007). As an outcome, cerebral perfusion
was improved by addition of IMM-H004 compared with tPA alone.
These improvements may be attributed either to the relief of brain
edema, to the enhanced angiogenesis after IMM-H004, or to both.
The contribution of each to the outcome needs further investigation.
The question then arises: what is the mechanism(s) responsible
for the beneﬁcial role of IMM-H004 in attenuating the tPA-aggravated brain edema and angiogenesis after I/R? To answer this question we performed an in vitro experiment using HBMECs and PC12

cells. The result showed that IMM-H004 may protect against tPAinduced damage in both type of cells after 24 h treatment, but more
effectively in HBMECs. Further studies in HBMECs revealed that
IMM-H004 increased the ATP supply in a dose-dependent manner
and, importantly, activated Akt which was dependent on PKA and
PI3K. This result is in contrast to the notion that Akt activation
mediates the expression of MMPs through NF-jB (Cheng et al.,
2006), but is consistent with reports showing that an increased activation of Akt ameliorates BBB via down-regulating NF-jB expression (Zhang et al., 2012) and plays a central role in angiogenesis
(Shiojima & Walsh, 2002), pointing to a signaling pathway for
IMM-H004 actions that involves an elevation of ATP and c-ATP
and a PKA- and PI3K-dependent activation of Akt. Nonetheless,
additional studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanism
under oxygen-glucose deprivation.
In summary, the present study has shown that IMM-H004 is able
to protect against the HT induced by delayed tPA treatment in both
acute and chronic phases of injury in vivo. In the acute phase,
IMM-H004 prevented expression of MMP-9, the accumulation of
MMP-2 on astrocytes and a decrease of occludin. In the chronic
phase, IMM-H004 promoted cerebral angiogenesis, thereby improving brain perfusion. These protective roles are probably mediated
via a mechanism involving elevation of ATP and c-ATP and a
PKA- and PI3K-dependent activation of Akt. These results suggest
IMM-H004 as a potential adjuvant for tPA treatment in the clinic,
and provide insight for understanding the mechanism behind the
beneﬁcial role of IMM-H004.
