Abstract
Stroke results in brain tissue damage from ischemia and oxidative stress. Molecular regulators of the protective versus deleterious cellular responses after cerebral ischemia remain
to be identified. Here, we show that deletion of Smad1, a conserved transcription factor that
mediates canonical bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, results in neuroprotection
in an ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) stroke model. Uninjured mice with conditional deletion of
Smad1 in the CNS (Smad1 cKO) displayed upregulation of the reactive astrocyte marker
GFAP and hypertrophic morphological changes in astrocytes compared to littermate controls. Additionally, cultured Smad1-/- astrocytes exhibited an enhanced antioxidant capacity.
When subjected to I/R injury by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), Smad1
cKO mice showed enhanced neuronal survival and improved neurological recovery at 7
days post-stroke. This neuroprotective phenotype is associated with attenuated reactive
astrocytosis and neuroinflammation, along with reductions in oxidative stress, p53 induction, and apoptosis. Our data suggest that Smad1-mediated signaling pathway is involved
in stroke pathophysiology and may present a new potential target for stroke therapy.

Introduction
The restriction of cerebral blood flow during ischemic stroke initiates a stereotypical pathological cascade that culminates in oxidative stress and apoptosis. Reperfusion after ischemia and
the neuroinflammation that ensues further exacerbate oxidative damage via production of
excessive reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines [1].
Cerebral ischemia also activates astrocytes, the most abundant population of non-neuronal
cells in the brain and first responders to ischemic insult [2]. Reactive astrocytes form an astroglial scar that demarcates the infarct area from neighboring tissue, but also constitutes a physical barrier to axon regeneration [3]. Importantly, astrocytes are capable of protecting neurons
from ischemic injury by releasing the antioxidant glutathione and taking up extracellular glutamate to combat excitotoxicity [3, 4]. Although the neuronal and glial responses to cerebral

ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are well described, the underlying molecular mechanisms
remain obscure. Identifying key molecular regulators that can influence stroke outcome
remains a pressing issue.
Smad1 is a conserved transcription factor that is activated by canonical bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) signaling [5]. BMPs and BMP receptors are upregulated following CNS injury
[6] and implicated in glial scar formation after ischemic stroke [7]. However, the precise functions of BMP/Smad1 signaling in stroke pathophysiology remain unknown; by contrast, its
roles in I/R injury outside the CNS have begun to emerge. For instance, following myocardial
infarction, BMP4/Smad1 signaling promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis through ROS-dependent pathways, and inhibition of BMP signaling confers protection against acute myocardial
infarction [8, 9]. Moreover, during DNA damage response (DDR), Smad1 is induced and contributes to cellular damage via p53-mediated cell death pathways, and Smad1 inhibition suppresses p53 induction, thereby rendering cells resistant to cell death due to DNA damage [10].
Of note, p53 is a well-characterized apoptotic gene that is upregulated during cerebral ischemia
and it promotes apoptosis through regulating cell death-associated target genes (e.g. Bax,
Puma, Noxa) or the mitochondria apoptogenic pathway [11, 12]. Additionally, misregulation
of BMP signaling is linked to many pathological conditions involving inflammation, oxidative
stress and cellular damage [13–15]. These studies raise the possibility that Smad1 may play a
pivotal role in mediating cell death and tissue injury following cerebral ischemia. We therefore
investigated whether Smad1 deletion would ameliorate I/R injury and improve neurological
recovery following transient ischemic stroke.
Here, we report that Smad1-deficient mice exhibit enhanced neuronal survival and
improved neurological recovery at 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO). This is accompanied by attenuated reactive astrocytosis and neuroinflammation,
along with reductions in oxidative stress, p53 induction, and apoptosis. Smad1 therefore represents a potential novel target for stroke therapy.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Mutant Mice
Smad1flox/flox mice [16] and Nestin-Cre mice [17] were obtained from the Jackson laboratory.
Smad1 heterozygous germline deletion (Smad1+/-) and Smad1 cKO (Smad1fl/-;Nestin-Cre)
mice were generated in our laboratory as described previously [18]. Mutant mice and their littermate controls of matched sex underwent tMCAO or sham surgery and were analyzed at various time points for histology, gene expression, and behavioral testing. Both sexes were
represented in the control and mutant cohorts. Heterozygote littermates (Smad1fl/- or
Smad1fl/+;Nestin-Cre) showed similar stroke responses as Smad1fl/+ or wildtype mice and were
therefore included in the control cohort.
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Transient MCAO Model
Adult mice (8–12 weeks old) were anesthetized with 110 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. The left common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and a silicon-coated 7–0 nylon suture
was inserted into the internal carotid artery (ICA) to occlude blood flow into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 1 hour. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored using a laser Doppler
Flowmetry (LDF) probe (0.8 mm diameter, model P-433, Vasamedics Inc.) that was secured
with stereotactic guidance to the temporal area, above the vascular territory of the left MCA

and away from large meningeal vessels. Successful MCA occlusion (MCAO) was confirmed by
over 80% reduction in the CBF relative to baseline (S6 Fig). After 1 hour, the suture was
removed to allow reperfusion, as confirmed by restoration of CBF (S6 Fig). Mice were allowed
to survive for 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months post surgery. Overall mortality from the tMCAO
surgery was 10%. A separate cohort of older mice (8–10 months old) also underwent tMCAO
surgery to investigate whether the effect of Smad1 deletion on neurological recovery is agedependent.
For assessment of neurological deficits, the modified Bederson Score scale [19] was applied
as follows: loss in consciousness and/or spontaneous activity (score of 4), falling to paretic side
(3), circling (2), failing to extend the forepaw of the paretic side fully (1), and no detectable
neurologic deficits (0).
For immunohistochemical analyses, we observed similar findings in both sexes; therefore
the data from both sexes were combined. For behavioral studies, we also grouped both sexes
together for each time point to increase the cohort size for sufficient power for statistical analysis. Specifically, the numbers of littermate mice used were as follows: for IHC analyses at 7 days
post-stroke, the control group included 2 females and 2 males, and the Smad1 cKO group
included 1 female and 3 males. For behavioral studies, at 7 days post-tMCAO, control cohort
included 4 females and 1 male, and Smad1 cKO cohort included 4 females and 2 males. For the
3-month behavioral data, the control cohort included 1 female and 3 males, and the Smad1
cKO cohort included 1 female and 2 male mice.

Western Blot
Lysates from freshly collected cortical tissue were prepared in RIPA buffer (Sigma), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), and homogenized using a Dounce
homogenizer (Kimble Chase). Protein levels were quantified using BCA assays (Pierce Thermo
Scientific). Proteins were resolved on NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) using the XCell SureLock system (Invitrogen). The immunoreactive bands were detected by fluorescent ODYSSEY infrared
imaging system (LI-COR). Equal protein loading was controlled by probing the blots with an
antibody to β-actin. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Smad1 (Abcam, 1:1000) and mouse antiβ-actin (Thermo Scientific, 1:2000).

Histology and Cell Quantification
Following behavioral analysis, mice were administered an overdose of Euthasol and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. For visualization of
vasculature, mice were perfused with 5 ml PBS followed by 2 ml bromophenol blue solution
(10 mg/ml in PBS).
Brains were post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded and sectioned in
the coronal plane at 20 μm thickness using a cryostat. For immunostaining, sections were collected free-floating in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide. Tissue sections were washed in PBS with
0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and incubated in blocking buffer (10% heat inactivated goat serum,
Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature. After overnight incubation with primary antibody
at 4°C, sections were washed and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies
(Molecular Probes, 1:750) for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:1000), mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount (EMS).
Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry include: rabbit GFAP (Dako Z0334,
1:800), mouse Nestin (Abcam ab6142, 1:100), chicken Vimentin (Novus Biologicals NB300223, 1:2000), rabbit S100 (Dako Z0311, 1:400), mouse NeuN (Millipore MAB377, 1:200), rabbit

Iba1 (Wako 019–19741, 1:500), rabbit activated Caspase 3 (R&D Systems AF835, 1:400),
mouse 8-hydroxyl-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) (Trevigen 4354-MC-050, 1:350), rabbit p53
(Santa Cruz sc6243, 1:50), rat CD31 (BD 553370, 1:250), rabbit Olig2 (Millipore AB9610,
1:500), and chicken GFP (Aves Labs GFP-1020, 1:500). Cresyl violet staining was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (EMS).
Images were captured using an Axio Imager.A2 (Zeiss) microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRc. Cell quantification was performed using ImageJ software. Specifically, images of the
peri-infarct area in the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex, as well as the corresponding cortical
region on the contralateral hemisphere were used for quantification of GFAP+ astrocytes,
S100+ astrocytes, Iba-1+ microglia, and NeuN+ neurons. Images of the stroke core were also
used for quantification of NeuN+ neurons. Images sampled throughout the entire ipsilateral
hemisphere were used for quantification of activated Caspase 3, 8-oxo-dG, and p53. A minimum of 3 images taken between approximately 1mm rostral and 2mm caudal to Bregma were
quantified per animal. All quantifications were performed on photos taken at 10X magnification, except for NeuN and 8-oxo-dG, which were performed on 20X images. Cells in the entire
field for each photo were quantified. Quantification was carried out by an experimenter
blinded for the genotypes.

Astrocyte Cultures and MTT Assay
Primary astrocytes were derived from neonatal (P1-P2) mouse cortex. Forebrains were
removed aseptically and cells from the neocortex were manually dissociated and seeded at a
density of 105/cm2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Lonza) and 100U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Over 95% of cultured cells were
identified as astrocytes by positive immunostaining for GFAP and S100. After reaching confluence, astrocytes were trypsinized and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well.
Twenty-four hours after passage, cells were challenged with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (50μM)
for 6 hours, and cell viability was evaluated using a MTT assay. MTT solution was prepared
(5mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) and filtered through a 0.2μm filter. 10 μl of MTT solution was added
to 100 μl of DMEM without phenol red to each well. Cells were incubated in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 4 hours. The MTT solution was then removed and the formed
MTT formazan was dissolved with 200 μl DMSO. Optical density (OD) was determined using
a plate reader at 570 nm, with a reference wavelength of 630 nm.

HEt Assay
Superoxide production in post-stroke brains was detected with in vivo hydroethidine labeling
(HEt, Invitrogen). HEt was injected intraperitoneally (200μl, 1mg/ml in PBS) 3 hours before
perfusion. HEt is oxidized by superoxide to fluorescent ethidium, which intercalates in DNA
and fluoresces red.

Real-time qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from cortical tissues using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), reverse transcribed
(SuperScript III, Invitrogen) and used for qRT-PCR (SYBR Green FastMix, Quanta). Data
were normalized to the housekeeping gene Tfrc transferrin receptor using the ΔΔCt method.
Primers are available upon request. At least three independent experiments with technical triplicates were performed for each condition.

Statistical Analysis
Neurological scores were analyzed using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc analyses. Astrocyte viability MTT data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA
followed by the Bonferroni test. Student’s t-tests and one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test were performed for cell count analyses. Data are presented as mean ± SEM,  p<0.05;

p<0.01; and  p<0.001.

Results
To study the role of Smad1 in cerebral ischemia, we generated Smad1 conditional knockout
mice (cKO) with Smad1 ablation in all neural cells in the CNS (Smad1fl/-; Nestin-Cre). Western
blot analysis confirmed deletion of Smad1 in the CNS in the Smad1 cKO mice (Fig 1A). The
specificity of Nestin-Cre recombination was verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the
Rosa26-YFP reporter line, which showed overlap of YFP signal with that of neural markers (S1
Fig), but not of microglial (Iba1+) nor endothelial markers (CD31+)(S2 Fig). Of note, Cre
expression in Nestin-Cre transgenic mice [17] is under the control of the 2nd intron of the rat
Nestin gene, which functions as a nervous system-specific enhancer [20]. Hence, the Cre
expression pattern in our mutant mice appeared more restricted than that of endogenous Nestin [21]. For instance, endogenous Nestin is also expressed in endothelial cells, however, in our
reporter line, Cre-mediated YFP expression was not readily detectable in endothelial cells in
the brain (S2B Fig).

Astrocytes in uninjured Smad1 cKO mice exhibit increased reactivity
Smad1 cKO mice developed normally with no significant differences in body weight (S3A Fig)
or motosensory behavior compared to littermate controls. The number of cortical neurons and
the cortical layout also appeared comparable between genotypes (Fig 1B). Interestingly, IHC
revealed an upregulation of GFAP in the cortex of Smad1 cKO mice in comparison to control
littermates (125 ± 20 vs. 59 ± 8 GFAP+ cells per field examined, p = 0.01) (Fig 1C and 1D).
GFAP is considered to be a sensitive and reliable marker for reactive astrocytes [22], our results
therefore suggest increased baseline levels of astrocyte reactivity in the Smad1 cKO animals.
Consistent with this model, the GFAP-expressing astrocytes also displayed marked morphological changes with hypertrophic cellular processes, another well-established measure of astrocyte reactivity (Fig 1C) [22]. To rule out a change in the total number of cortical astrocytes, we
performed immunolabeling for S100B, a pan-astrocyte marker for both reactive and non-reactive astrocytes. We found no apparent differences in the number nor spatial distribution of
S100B-expressing astrocytes between Smad1 cKO mice and controls (Fig 1C). Notably, consistent with previous reports [23, 24], S100B appeared more abundantly expressed in a subtype of
mature astrocytes ensheathing blood vessels (Fig 1C). There was a subtle hypertrophic change
in a subpopulation of S100B-expressing astrocytes in the mutants, which is not as prominent
as seen in GFAP-expressing astrocytes (Fig 1C). Of note, S100B, a member of S100 family of
EF hand calcium binding proteins, is localized predominantly in central cytoplasm and
nucleus, thus does not delineate well cellular processes [23, 24]. In both genotypes, GFAP+
astrocytes similarly formed extensive contacts with cortical microvasculature, although mutant
GFAP+ astrocytes displayed more elaborate cellular processes (S3B Fig). Hence, despite
increased GFAP expression, general astrocyte development does not appear to be significantly
altered by Smad1 deletion.
Since astrocytes possess antioxidant capacity, we investigated whether this property might
be affected in Smad1-/- astrocytes. Primary astrocytes derived from both mutant and control littermates appeared comparable in cell morphology and GFAP expression (Fig 1E). However,

and S100A6, respectively, therefore, the immunoreactivity predominantly reflects S100B. Enlarged images of boxed areas in (C) are shown on the right,

Smad1-/- astrocytes displayed significantly enhanced resistance to oxidative stress induced by
H2O2 treatment, as revealed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT)
assay (viability of 0.45 ± 0.10 vs. 0.23 ± 0.01 in mutant vs. control astrocytes; p < 0.05; Fig 1F).
It is noteworthy that CNS tissue is well known for an adaptation process of the so-called ischemic preconditioning effect, whereby a prior small ischemia would lead to protection against
subsequent ischemia [25]. Hence, akin to the preconditioning effect, the increased astrocytic
reactivity in uninjured Smad1 cKO mice (reflected by GFAP upregulation and morphological
alterations) may lead to enhanced antioxidant capacity in astrocytes as a result of an adaptive
process or a priming effect.

Reduced reactive astrocytosis in Smad1 cKO mice after transient MCAO
Since Smad1-/- astrocytes show enhanced antioxidant capacity, and astrocytes can protect
against ischemic injury by releasing the antioxidant glutathione [3, 4], we next sought to test
whether Smad1 deletion would attenuate stroke pathophysiology. We performed transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) on adult (8 to 12 weeks old) Smad1 cKO mice and
littermate controls. By day 7 following tMCAO, the infarct core in the control animals could be
easily distinguished from the peri-infarct area by a rim of reactive astrocytes (GFAP+) and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Iba1+) in the frontoparietal cortex, striatum and hippocampus
(Figs 2 and 3). In contrast, both astroglial and inflammatory responses were significantly attenuated in Smad1 cKO mice (Figs 2 and 3). Quantification showed that the number of GFAP+
astrocytes in the peri-infarct frontal cortex was decreased by 45% in Smad1 cKO mice compared to controls (148 ± 21 vs. 268 ± 18 per field examined; p = 0.0003; Fig 2B–2D). The reactive astrocytes in the mutant animals also displayed fewer hypertrophic processes (Fig 2B) and
a 50% decrease in the intensity of GFAP immunosignals compared to controls (Fig 2C). IHC
for Nestin and Vimentin, two additional markers of reactive astrocytes, confirmed the attenuated astrogliosis in the peri-infarct area of Smad1 cKO mice (Fig 2B). Similar findings were
observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus (Fig 2E). Consistent with an attenuated reactive astrocytosis, the area of tissue damage as outlined by the intense rim of GFAP immunoreactivity
(Fig 2A) relative to the area of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere was significantly smaller in
mutants than controls (6.7% ± 1.9 vs. 30.5% ± 2.6; p < 0.001). It is worth mentioning that
although 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is often used to evaluate infarct
size, particularly in permanent MCAO models, it does not reliably distinguish the border
between healthy and dead tissue at 7 days after tMCAO. This is because the optimum time to
perform TTC staining in the tMCAO model is 24 h to 48 h after ischemia, after which macrophages will infiltrate the infarct area, resulting in smudging of the infarct border and interference with measurement of the infarct volume [26]. In fact, comparative studies have
demonstrated that at time points beyond 24 h conventional histopathological analyses are
superior to TTC staining for accurate delineation of structural and cellular changes within the
infarct tissue [27].
It is notable that Smad1-/- astrocytes did mount a response to ischemic insult, resulting in a
1.7-fold increase in the number of GFAP+ astrocytes in the ipsilateral peri-infarct area relative
to the contralateral cortex (148 ± 21 vs. 89 ± 10 per field examined; p < 0.05, Fig 2C). However,
this astrocytic reaction occurred at a much lower level than in control mice, which showed a
14.9-fold increase in the number of GFAP+ astrocytes in ipsilateral than contralateral periinfarct cortex (268 ± 18 vs. 18 ± 2; Fig 2C). Consistent with a baseline increase in astrocyte
reactivity in uninjured mutant mice (Fig 1C), the number of GFAP+ astrocytes in the contralateral hemisphere was higher in mutants than controls after stroke (89 ± 10 vs. 18 ± 2,
p < 0.001) (Fig 2C). It is also noteworthy that in areas of severe ischemia, such as in the striatal

stroke core, which is characteristic of the intraluminal MCA occlusion model used in this
study, robust reactive astrocytosis did occur in both mutant and control mice (Fig 2A).
We also examined the astroglial scar at 3 months post-tMCAO. In both control and Smad1
cKO animals, residual astroglial scarring was visible, but confined to the striatal stroke core,
with small necrotic centers sometime observed in control animals (Fig 2A). In both groups,
astrocytic reaction had subsided significantly in the cortex by 3 months post-stroke (Fig 2A).

Microglial activation is attenuated in Smad1 cKO mice after stroke
At baseline, we observed that Iba1+ microglia in the cortex were similar in number and morphology in mutant and control animals (Fig 3A). In response to stroke, in control mice, activated microglia typically display an amoeboid morphology with shortened processes, but this
morphological change was less prominent in mutants (Fig 3B). Additionally, at day 7 posttMCAO, the number of Iba1+ inflammatory cells in the peri-infarct cortical area in Smad1
cKO mice was only 59% of the number present in controls (147 ± 12 vs. 250 ± 15; p < 0.001;
Fig 3B). The ipsilateral striatum and hippocampus of mutant mice were also largely spared of
major inflammatory changes (Fig 3C and 3D).
Nestin-Cre driven Smad1 deletion is not expected to occur in microglia, as confirmed by the
absence of Cre-mediated recombination in Iba1+ cells in the Rosa26-YFP reporter line (S2A
Fig). Hence, the reduced inflammatory response in Smad1 cKO mice is more likely a result of
attenuated stroke pathophysiology than microglial dysfunction. We surveyed the gene expression of a number of cytokines and chemokines—CCL2, CCR2, CCL5, CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNγ,
TNFα, IL1β and IL6—in the ischemic cortex at 3 days post-stroke, but did not find statistically
significant differences between mutants and controls (S4A Fig), thus future studies on protein
levels or spatial distribution will be required to determine potential differences in the cytokine
profiles between the two groups.

Smad1 deletion is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia
We next investigated whether the attenuated reactive astrocytosis and the reduced neuroinflammation after tMCAO are associated with neuroprotection in mutant mice. Following
tMCAO, both groups exhibited comparable neurological deficits at 24 h post-stroke, suggesting
similar primary injury in both cohorts (neurological deficit scores of 0.83 ± 0.17 vs. 1.50 ± 0.39;
p > 0.05, Fig 4A). However, by 7 days post-stroke, neurological recovery was significantly better in mutant than control animals (neurological deficit scores of 0.25 ± 0.17 vs. 1.20 ± 0.25, Fig
4A). Whereas control mice continued to display asymmetrical posturing, circling, and ptosis of
the ipsilateral eyelid, these deficits were either absent or attenuated in Smad1 cKO mice (S5A
Fig). Importantly, at 1 and 3 months post-stroke, there was no sign of delayed neurological
deterioration in Smad1 cKO mice (S5B Fig), in agreement with the immunohistological analyses at 3 months post-tMCAO which revealed that astrogial reaction had largely subsided in the
cortex in both cohorts, and only residual astroglial scarring was visible and confined to the
striatal stroke core (Fig 2A). Since age can greatly influence stroke outcome [28], we conducted
additional tMCAO studies to analyze neurological recovery in older cohorts of mice. We found
that Smad1 cKO mice at 8 to 10 months of age also exhibited significant improvement in functional recovery at 7 days post-stroke (S5C Fig).

confirmed the stereotypical morphological changes of acute neuronal damage in control animals, including shrunken cell bodies, pyknotic nuclei, perineuronal vacuolations, and neuronal
necrosis, all of which were less prominent in Smad1 cKO mice (Fig 4B). At 7 days posttMCAO, mutant mice exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in the number of surviving neurons

The nuclei of NeuN+ neurons appeared pyknotic in control animals, but relatively normal in
size and shape in mutants (Fig 4C). In addition, CA1 and CA3 neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus also exhibited less neuronal damage in mutants (Fig 4F).

Smad1 deletion reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis after cerebral
ischemia
To determine whether reduced oxidative stress may account for the neuroprotective phenotype
in Smad1-deficient mice, we conducted in vivo HEt assays, which showed a 50% decrease in
the ROS levels on the ischemic hemisphere in mutant mice, and a 35% reduction in the number
of cells undergoing nucleic acid oxidation by 8-oxo-dG immunostaining compared to controls
(140 ± 15 vs. 217 ± 7; p < 0.001; Fig 5A). Significantly fewer apoptotic cells (activated Caspase
3+) were present in mutant mice than controls (3 ± 1 vs. 34 ± 7 per field examined; p < 0.001;
Fig 5B), which is consistent with reduced ROS levels. Similarly, p53 induction after tMCAO
was also significantly attenuated in mutants in comparison to controls (21 ± 9 vs. 132 ± 15
p53+ cells; p<0.001; Fig 5B). The reduced stroke severity in mutant mice is unlikely a result of
major differences in vasculature since immunostaining for CD31, an endothelial marker,
showed no detectable differences in the density or distribution of microvasculature (S5D Fig).
Examination of the macrovascular network on the cortical surface and circle of Willis at the
ventral skull base also revealed no differences between genotypes (S5E Fig). This is in accordance with the absence of Cre-mediated recombination in endothelial cells in our cKO mice
(S2B Fig). Furthermore, we monitored cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a laser Doppler Flowmetry probe, and confirmed that mutant and control mice exhibited a similar profile of
reduced CBF during the 1 h tMCAO and return of CBF after reperfusion (S6 Fig). Nonetheless,
we cannot exclude the possibility that subtle vascular changes such as differences in permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) or neurovascular niche may contribute to the neuroprotective
phenotype observed in the Smad1 cKO mice, a topic worthy future investigation.

Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that Smad1 deletion in the CNS confers neuroprotection in a cerebral I/
R injury model in both young and older mice, thus establishing a novel link between Smad1
and stroke pathophysiology. Our model agrees with and further extends previous findings that
suppression of BMP/Smad signaling is associated with reduced apoptosis and inflammation
following myocardial infarction.
The initial neurological deficits were comparable between wildtype and Smad1 cKO mice
after transient MCAO, indicating similar extent of primary ischemic injury. This is also consistent with a similar degree of reduction in cerebral blood flow during the occlusion of the MCA
in both groups (S6 Fig). However, mice with Smad1 ablation in the CNS showed better neurological recovery at 7 days post-tMCAO than control animals. This occurs at a time point before
cortical restructuring and axonal rewiring may have taken place. Likewise, in this early time
frame, stroke-triggered neurogenesis is unlikely to have contributed significantly to functional
recovery. Thus, the observed neuroprotective phenotypes in Smad1 cKO mice at 7 day post-

stroke are more likely a result of reduced secondary injury than enhanced neural repair. Secondary injury is well known to exacerbate immediate ischemic damage by release of cytokines,
ROS/RNS, and apoptotic mediators. Indeed, Smad1-deficient mice exhibited a significant
attenuation of reactive astrocytosis and neuroinflammation—two potent sources of secondary
injury.

The mechanisms by which Smad1 deletion results in attenuated glial responses and neuronal protection after stroke remain to be determined. We observed an enhanced anti-oxidant
capacity in Smad1 deficient astrocytes, which may account for the protective phenotypes after
tMCAO. However, since Smad1 is also deleted in neurons in the mutant mice, it is possible
that it may lead to direct neuronal protective effects against ischemic stress. The relative contribution of protective mechanisms in neurons versus glial cells needs to be further resolved in
future studies using cell-type specific Cre recombinase lines. Furthermore, although NestinCre mediated recombination does not appear to have occurred to a large extent in endothelial
cells and no major vascular abnormalities were observed in Smad1 cKO mice, subtle changes
in the neurovascular niche and permeability of BBB to immune cells remain a possibility, and
may contribute to the protective phenotype observed in the Smad1 cKO mice after tMCAO.
Additional in-depth investigation into the structure and integrity of the cerebral vasculature
and the usage of cell-type-specific Cre lines are imperative to address the potential contribution
of vascular differences to stroke protection. Smad1 deletion may also engage other immediate
or long-term protective mechanisms, such as reducing cellular metabolism or promoting synaptic plasticity [29], which need to be further explored. It is also noteworthy that the current
study combines data from both sexes, thus, does not address gender effects in the Smad1 cKO
mice after stroke, a topic worthy of future investigation.
Our data show that Smad1 deletion affects several aspects of astrocytic function, which may
contribute to neuroprotection against stroke: i) GFAP expression is elevated in astrocytes in
uninjured Smad1 cKO mice. GFAP is a reliable marker for reactive astrocytes [22], thus the
baseline upregulation of GFAP in astrocytes in conjunction with the associated hypertrophic
morphological changes implies increased baseline levels of astrocyte reactivity, perhaps in
response to cumulative physiological stressors. This may lead to enhanced antioxidant capacity
in astrocytes as a result of the priming effect against subsequent pathological stressors, akin to
the well-described ischemic preconditioning [25]. ii) Absence of Smad1 activity may directly
lead to enhanced antioxidant capacity in astrocytes, for the following reason: astrocytes used
for oxidative stress test were derived from neonatal pups (Fig 1F), thus they are unlikely to
have had sufficient time to experience a potential priming effect (however, extrapolation of the
findings from cultured neonatal primary astrocytes to adult astrocytes in vivo requires caution). Notably, Smad1 deletion does not seem to prevent astrocytes from mounting a reaction
to CNS injury, as in areas of severe ischemia, such as in the striatal stroke core, robust reactive
astrocytosis did occur in both mutant and control mice (Fig 2A). It is also worth mentioning
that although BMP promotes astrocyte differentiation during development [30], Smad1 deletion does not appear to affect general astrocyte development. This may be related to compensatory roles of other Smads or that BMP may signal through non-canonical, Smad1-independent
pathways to promote astrocyte differentiation.
Our current study extends previous work on transcription factors that regulate a broad
range of ischemia-induced genes in a cell-type specific and time-dependent manner, including
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), HIF-1α, Nrf2, and CREB [31–34]. Downstream targets of Smad1
in the setting of cerebral ischemia remain to be identified, but may include regulators of redox
homeostasis, as ROS levels and nucleotide oxidation are lower in ischemic tissue in the absence
of Smad1. This is in agreement with the reported involvement of BMP/Smad1 signaling in
redox homeostasis through NOX activation in O-2A progenitor cells [35], cardiomyocytes [9],
vascular epithelial cells [36] and vascular smooth muscle cells [37]. Notably, in the current
study, we did not observe significant differences in the transcription of nine pro- and antioxidant genes examined in uninjured cortical tissue or at 3 days post-stroke between the groups
(S4B Fig). Future cell-type specific and time-dependent studies on the protein level or on other
redox-associated genes may provide further insight. In addition, Smad1 deletion may affect

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0136967 August 28, 2015

Smad1 Regulates Stroke Pathophysiology

other target genes such as p53. Although we observed that p53 induction after stroke was attenuated in Smad1-deficient mice, the mechanism by which Smad1 is linked to p53 induction
after cerebral I/R injury remains to be clarified.
Finally, in cerebral ischemia, Smad1 may mainly function as a downstream effector of
canonical BMP signaling, or alternatively, as a mediator of other stroke-induced signaling
pathways, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or GSK3β signaling [38, 39].
Consistent with our results and in support of a role of Smad1 in mediating canonical BMP signaling in stroke, Noggin, an endogenous BMP antagonist, has been shown to confer protection
against ischemic brain injury. Overexpression of Noggin in a transgenic ischemic model leads
to smaller infarct volumes and attenuated motor deficits after cortical focal stroke [40]. Administration of Noggin-expressing bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) also enhances brain repair
after MCAO [41]. On the other hand, intraventricular injection of BMP7 reportedly facilitates
motor recovery after stroke [42], although the effect is probably through enhanced proliferation of neural progenitors [43], which takes place in a much later timeframe than that of the
current study. Whether Smad1 is also involved in activating neural progenitors after cerebral
ischemia awaits further study. Since the extent of neurogenesis from the subventricular zone
(SVZ) is a function of stroke size, a simple comparison of ischemia-triggered neurogenesis in
our mutant mice may be confounded by the more limited tissue injury in Smad1 cKO mutants,
hence, selective ablation of Smad1 in SVZ cells will be required.
Our finding of a potential link between astrocyte phenotype (GFAP upregulation and
hypertrophic morphology) and stroke protection raises a tantalizing possibility that Smad1
ablation in the CNS may mimic the well-known preconditioning effect in raising the baseline
levels of astrocyte reactivity. This working model requires further mechanistic studies to identify the trigger that leads to enhanced astrocyte reactivity following Smad1 deletion in the CNS.
Nonetheless, our study opens door for future exploration to determine whether inhibition of
BMP/Smad1 signaling by small-molecule inhibitors, such as dorsomorphin [44], shortly after
stroke would confer neuroprotection, or whether for high-risk patients administering a selective BMP/Smad inhibitor preemptively would serve as a preventative measure against stroke.
Our study also raises the possibility that Smad1 deletion may confer protection against other
CNS stressors that are associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a neuroprotective phenotype in Smad1-deficient mice following cerebral I/R injury. Developing strategies to inhibit the Smad1-mediated pathway may represent a
novel direction for stroke protection.
