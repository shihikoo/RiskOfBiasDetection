Abstract
This is the first study to assess the influence of sex on the evolution of ischaemic injury and penumbra. Permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion was induced in male (n ¼ 9) and female (n ¼ 10) Sprague-Dawley rats. Diffusion-weighted
imaging was acquired over 4 h and infarct determined from T2 images at 24 h post-permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion. Penumbra was determined retrospectively from serial apparent diffusion coefficient lesions and T2-defined
infarct. Apparent diffusion coefficient lesion volume was significantly smaller in females from 0.5 to 4 h post permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion as was infarct volume. Penumbral volume, and its loss over time, was not significantly
different despite the sex difference in acute and final lesion volumes.

Introduction
The ischaemic penumbra is a well-established concept
in stroke, deﬁned as a region of hypoperfused, metabolically active tissue surrounding the ischaemic core.1
If blood ﬂow is not restored, this tissue becomes incorporated into the ischaemic core and progresses to
infarction.2,3 Therefore, it is crucial that the spatiotemporal evolution of ischaemic damage and penumbra is
characterised in animal models of focal cerebral ischaemia to determine if there are diﬀerences in the optimal
time for therapeutic intervention with regard to sex and
in the presence of known stroke risk factors.
Magnetic resonance (MRI) diﬀusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) identiﬁes tissue where diﬀusion is
restricted as a result of cytotoxic oedema leading to
a reduction in the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient
(ADC). Assessment of penumbral tissue can be determined retrospectively from the growth of the DWI or
ADC lesion over time and the ﬁnal infarct, a method
used previously for both pre-clinical and clinical
data sets.4

In pre-clinical research, across the biological disciplines, there is still a considerable sex bias with studies on
male animals outnumbering those in females and in
particular this bias is most prominent in neuroscience
research.5 Reasons often cited for the prevalence of
males over females are due to the concerns over contributions of the oestrus cycle; however, a recent metaanalysis in female mice demonstrated that they were no
more variable when tested throughout their oestrus
cycle than males.6 Sex is a key factor inﬂuencing various aspects of human stroke including stroke outcome
and response to treatment.7 Likewise, in animal models
of stroke, diﬀerences in molecular mechanisms of

ischaemic cell death, stroke outcome and response to
therapy have been observed between males and
females.8 To date, the acute spatiotemporal progression
of ischaemic damage and fate of penumbra has not
been characterised in female rats.
The study aims were: (1) to establish MRI diﬀusion
thresholds of abnormality in male and female rats following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO); (2) apply these thresholds to assess diﬀerences in the spatiotemporal evolution of ischaemic
damage; (3) using retrospective analysis of ADC
lesion and infarct volume to calculate penumbra, and
compare penumbra volume and lifespan in males and
females over the ﬁrst 4 h post-stroke.

Materials and methods
All experiments were performed in age-matched (12–16
weeks) Sprague-Dawley rats (males: 300–350 g, females:
250–280 g, Harlan, UK) under licence from the UK
Home Oﬃce, were subject to the Animals (Scientiﬁc
Procedures) Act, 1986. The report was carried out in
accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (http://
www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive). Rats were randomly
assigned to surgery using a random list generator
(www.random.org).

Model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
Rats were intubated, ventilated and permanent MCAO
was carried out under isoﬂurane anaesthesia (5%
induction, 2–2.5% maintenance in 70% N2O 30%
O2). Body temperature was maintained at 37 C and
both femoral arteries were cannulated for mean arterial
blood pressure (MABP) measurement and blood gas
analysis. MABP and heart rate were continuously recorded under general anaesthesia, including scanning
(AcqKnowledge, Biopac Systems, CA, USA).
Permanent MCAO was induced with an intraluminal
ﬁlament (diameter: 0.31–0.35 mm, tip length: 5–6 mm,
Doccol, CA, USA) as previously described.9

MRI scanning
MRI was performed on a Bruker Biospec 7-T/30-cm
system with a gradient insert (121 mm ID, 400 mT/m)
and a 72-mm birdcage resonator. A four-channel
phased-array rat head surface coil was used for brain
imaging. Arterial blood gas analysis was determined
hourly (0–4 h) during scanning.
DWI was performed at 0.5 h and hourly for 4 h post
MCAO to generate quantitative ADC maps and allow
assessment of ischaemic injury.
At 24 h post-MCAO, animals were re-anaesthetised
and scanned with a RARE T2-weighted sequence for

assessment of infarct volume. For full details of imaging protocol see supplementary ﬁle.

Image analysis
Quantitative ADC maps, (  103 mm2/s) generated
from raw DWI images using Paravision 5 software
(Bruker, Germany) were subsequently processed using
Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Infarct volume was calculated by manually delineating the hyperintense region on T2 slices, which corresponded anatomically to the ADC slices acquired
acutely. Area of infarct was summed over all slices
and multiplied by slice thickness to calculate total
infarct volume which was corrected for brain swelling.10 ADC thresholds were calculated as previously
described.11
Penumbral tissue was assessed retrospectively from
ADC-derived lesion growth from 30 min and the
oedema-corrected infarct volume at 24 h. ADC lesion
growth at each time point was also expressed as a percentage of ﬁnal infarct volume to determine the potential impact of intervention at each time point. All
analyses were undertaken blind to the sex of rats.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD. Infarct volume and
ADC threshold values were compared between males
and females using a Student’s unpaired t-test. Changes
in ADC lesion volume and penumbra over time and
between sexes were assessed by a two-way ANOVA
(between-subjects factor: sex; within-subjects factor:
time) with Bonferroni’s post-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant and statistical tests
were performed using GraphPad Prism v6.

Results
Mortality and physiological parameters
Two of 12 female rats were excluded from analysis
due to incomplete MCA occlusion. Three of 12 male
rats died overnight before T2-weighted images could
be acquired. Physiological variables remained within
normal
levels
during
stroke
surgery
and
throughout MRI scanning and were comparable
between the sexes.

Temporal evolution of ADC lesion and final infarct
Oedema-corrected infarct volume at 24 h post-MCAO
was signiﬁcantly larger in males (males 217  49 mm3,
females 151  56 mm3; P < 0.05). Brain swelling was
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between groups (males:

Baskerville et al.
18.2  3.0%, females: 17.3  1.9% increase of ipsilateral hemisphere, P ¼ 0.3).
Brain volume at 4 h post-MCAO calculated across
eight coronal slices, was not statistically diﬀerent
between sexes (males: 901  38 mm3, females: 892 
35 mm3, P ¼ 0.6). Similarly, there were no diﬀerences
in brain volume at 24 h post MCAO between sexes
(males: 976  45 mm3, females: 951  33 mm3). There
was no evidence of acute brain swelling as hemisphere
volume did not change signiﬁcantly over the 0–4 h time
course. Mean contralateral ADC values were similar
between the sexes (males: 0.78  0.02, females:
0.77  0.02  103 mm2/s, P ¼ 0.7) and did not change
signiﬁcantly throughout the 4 h scanning protocol. The
absolute ADC threshold of abnormality for male rats
was 0.58  0.05  103 mm2/s, a 25  2% reduction
from mean contralateral ADC values at 4 h post
MCAO. In female rats, the equivalent ADC threshold
was 0.53  0.03  103 mm2/s, a 29  2% reduction
from mean contralateral ADC values. Both the

383
absolute and relative ADC thresholds were similar
between the sexes (P > 0.05).
From the two-way ANOVA, the main eﬀect of sex
was signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.0037, F (1, 19) ¼ 10.97) as was the
main eﬀect of time (P < 0.0001, F (4, 76) ¼ 112.1). The
interaction between the two factors was not signiﬁcant
(P ¼ 0.3757). Using the ADC thresholds for each sex,
the ADC-derived lesions increased signiﬁcantly over
time in males (from 98  64 mm3 at 30 min to 223 
50 mm3 at 4 h; P < 0.001) and females (45  28 mm3
at 30 min to 147  50 mm3; P < 0.001). ADC lesions
were signiﬁcantly smaller in female rats from as early
as 60 min post-MCAO, and this eﬀect was maintained
throughout the 4 h time course (Figure 1(a)).

Temporal change of the ischaemic penumbra
Penumbral tissue was assessed retrospectively from the
growth of the ADC lesion into the ﬁnal infarct at 24 h
post-stroke. Figure 2 illustrates the growth of the ADC

The absolute volume of penumbra determined by comparing the ADC lesion at each time point with 24 h
infarct decreased signiﬁcantly over time in both male
(from 121  41 mm3 at 0.5 h to 0  12 mm3 at 4 h,

P < 0.0001) and female rats (from 105  44 mm3 at
0.5 h to 4  14 mm3 at 4 h, P < 0.0001) with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between sexes (F (1, 17) ¼ 0.1312,
P ¼ 0.7216, Figure 1(b)). Figure 1(c) shows the
amount of penumbral tissue at each time point

expressed as a percentage of the ﬁnal infarct in males
and females reﬂecting the potential impact of intervention at these time points. For instance, at 30 min following MCAO, 59  23% of the ﬁnal infarct in males
was potentially salvageable while in females this equated to 70  13% (Figure 1(c)).

Discussion
The STAIR recommendations highlight the importance
of investigating sex diﬀerences in experimental stroke
studies.12 It is well established that sex diﬀerences exist
in relation to infarct size following experimental stroke
with females exhibiting smaller infarcts and improved
behavioural outcome compared to males.8 However, to
our knowledge, sex diﬀerences in the amount of salvageable penumbra and its lifespan have not been studied. This is the ﬁrst study to (1) deﬁne sex-speciﬁc
diﬀusion viability thresholds and (2) investigate if sex
inﬂuences the acute evolution of ischaemic damage,
penumbra volume and its loss during the critical ﬁrst
hours following stroke. The major ﬁndings are (1)
calculated diﬀusion thresholds of tissue abnormality
were comparable between the sexes; (2) the acute
ADC lesion volume and ﬁnal infarct were smaller in
female rats; (3) penumbra volume, and its loss over
time, was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between sexes; (4)
Our ADC thresholds of 0.58 and 0.53  103 mm2/s
(25% and 29% reduction) for male and female rats,
respectively, were similar to previously published
thresholds for male Sprague Dawley rats 13–15 and comorbid strains such as the spontaneously hypertensive
stroke-prone (SHRSP) rat (21% reduction) and its
normotensive control the WKY (23% reduction).11
This suggests that rat strain and sex do not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ADC threshold following
MCAO.
Using these ADC thresholds, although the absolute
ADC lesion volume was smaller in females, the growth
in ADC lesion volume (and consequent loss of penumbra over time) was similar in males and females.
Previous studies have established sex-speciﬁc diﬀerences in infarct volume following MCAO with female
sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone having
neuroprotective inﬂuences.8,16 Our data show that
ischaemic damage was smaller in female rats from as
early as 30 min after MCAO and this was maintained
throughout the acute scanning protocol and similarly
reﬂected in the ﬁnal infarct at 24 h.
Retrospective assessment of penumbra volume
revealed no signiﬁcant sex diﬀerence in the absolute
volume of penumbra nor in loss of penumbra to the
ischaemic core suggesting that the therapeutic time
window for intervention is similar. However, absolute
volumes do not inform on potential impact of an

385
intervention on ﬁnal outcome, given that ﬁnal infarct
volumes are diﬀerent. Therefore, we calculated penumbra volume as a percentage of the respective ﬁnal
infarct. Within the ﬁrst hour of stroke onset, an intervention (i.e. thrombolysis or thrombectomy to induce
reperfusion) would have potentially have greater beneﬁt in females in terms of the reduction in ﬁnal infarct.
As a comparison, our previous data from normotensive
WKY and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHRSP) demonstrated that early intervention in
SHRSP has much less of an impact on the ﬁnal infarct
volume compared to other strains. One limitation of the
present study was that we did not know which stage of
the oestrus cycle female rats were within at the time of
stroke surgery and this may account for increased variability in this group; however, a recent meta-analysis
challenged this assumption.6
In conclusion, although the amount of brain damage
is signiﬁcantly smaller in females during the acute phase
following stroke, there was no diﬀerence in the ADC
viability threshold, or the amount or lifespan of potentially salvageable penumbral tissue.
