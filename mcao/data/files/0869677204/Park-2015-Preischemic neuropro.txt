showed a higher number of NeuN positive cells, lower activated astrocytes in GFAP and a
lower apoptosis in TUNEL staining. This study showed that single doses of minocycline

in post-stroke therapy but also in stroke prevention in several cerebrovascular procedures
like carotid endarterectomy, bypass procedure, endovascular angioplasty, thromboembolectomy or thrombolysis.

Introduction

Stroke is one of the most common causes of death worldwide
and the most frequent cause of permanent disability. The
poor prognosis of stroke is due to irreversible loss of brain
cells before the patient receives medical attention, which is
exacerbated by the void in delayed treatment options to
protect against secondary injury. Cell death associated with
the initial blood ﬂow interruption and the immediately
ensuing excitotoxicity are abrupt, while inﬂammation occurs
over a long period of time from stroke onset. Accordingly,
anti-inﬂammatory treatment is likely to extend the therapeutic window allowing improved intervention in stroke
(Zhang et al., 2004).
Within several hours after stroke onset, ischemia induces
inﬂammation that causes simultaneous alterations in the
cerebrovasculatures including apoptosis and activation of
microglia (Fawcett and Asher, 1999; Silver and Miller, 2004).
Activated microglia and proliferated astrocytes release toxic
substances such as nitric oxide (NO) and free radicals that
can damage healthy neurons (Giulian, 1993) although some
reports showed the beneﬁcial role of microglia (Neumann
et al., 2006, 2008). Free radicals generated during ischemia
and reperfusion also play an important role in the development of brain damage via obstruction of cell membranes and
formation of edema (Matsuo et al., 1995; Simonian and Coyle,
1996; Takamatsu et al., 1998). Platelet aggregation was also
reported as one of the aggravating factors of cerebral ischemia (Suzuki et al., 1989). Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a strong
vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator, is increased, and
aggravates brain damage after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
(Chen et al., 1986; Petroni et al., 1989).
Minocycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline with independent anti-inﬂammatory effects that is neuroprotective in
models of brain injury including stroke (Domercq and Matute,
2004; Yrjanheikki et al., 1999). Neuroprotective effects of
Minocycline include inhibition of gliosis, apoptosis, free
radical formation, and peripheral inﬂammation (Fox et al.,

2005; Tomas-Camardiel et al., 2004). Speciﬁcally, minocycline
inhibits the post-ischemic induction of nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) and reduces the release of cytochrome c by directly
conferring stability to the mitochondrial membrane (Wang
et al., 1998). Sodium ozagrel (ozagrel) is a selective TXA2
synthase inhibitor. It ameliorates platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and brain edema in acute cerebral ischemia
(Chen et al., 1986).
Most of studies of minocycline and ozagrel are about the
post-stroke therapeutic effect. However, many cerebrovascular procedures, like conventional cerebral angiography, carotid endarterectomy (CEA), balloon angioplasty or stenting,
temporary block of cerebral circulation during cerebral aneurysm clipping or external carotid–internal carotid (EC–IC)
bypass, often cause ischemic stroke (Bendszus et al., 1999;
Britt et al., 2000; Enevoldsen et al., 1999; Kato et al., 2003;
Soeda et al., 2003). Arterial vasospasm after subarachnoid
hemorrhage can cause large cerebral infarct. The aim of this
study is to assess the neuroprotective effect of minocycline
and ozagrel when administered prior to these several neurovascular procedures which have a risk of ischemic stroke.

Results

2.1.

Behavior evaluation

Fig. 1 shows behavioral results. Before ischemia, no rats showed
a neurobehavioral deﬁcit. Mino group or SO group showed more
improved performance than control group in the adhesive
removal test at 7 days after MCAO. In the adhesive removal test,
there was a signiﬁcant difference in the scores at 7 days in the
Mino and SO group compared to the control group (Con:
129.90717.00, Mino: 56.33720.47, SO: 73.80720.47 s, po0.05)
although there was no signiﬁcant difference at day 1 (Con:
154.2873.86, Mino: 159.00715.32, SO: 152.40715.20 s). Mino
group or SO group also showed signiﬁcant improvement in
treadmill test at day 1 (Con: 29.4776.95, Mino: 48.5077.48,

Fig. 1 – Behavior evaluations after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats in Mino and SO group remove adhesive paper
more quickly and more tolerable in treadmill test. The Mino group shows a slightly improved performance than the SO group
although there is no statistical signiﬁcance. npo0.05, nnpo0.01.

SO: 50.1774.93 m/min, po0.05) and at day 7 (Con: 44.7176.72,
Mino: 68.4274.50, SO: 60.1272.81 m/min, po0.05) after MCAO.

2.2.

Infarct volume

A representative photograph of brain slices obtained at 7 days
after MCAO is shown in Fig. 2. Both non-stained (white) parts
and weakly stained (pale-red) parts can be seen adjacent to
the non-stained parts. The brains of rats were stained with
TTC to obtain the infarct volume and calculated by measuring the area of infarction area (Fig. 2B). Both the area and
volume of the non- or weakly-stained parts in Mino and SO
groups were signiﬁcantly decreased on TCC stained slices.
There were signiﬁcant differences in infarct volume between
control groups and Mino group or SO group, and also between
Mino and SO group (Con: 394.31786.85, Mino: 213.58752.94,
SO: 255.10763.14 mm3, po0.05).

2.3.

Immunohistoﬂuorescence staining

The number of astrocytes, neurons and apoptotic cells in the
peri-infarct region was observed at 7 days after MCAO. All
drug-treated groups showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the
density of GFAP positive cells compared to the control group
in the analysis of GFAP positive cells (Fig. 3). There was no
statistical difference between Mino and SO group although
the GFAP expression was slightly lower in Mino group (Con:
24097300, Mino: 18007250, SO: 20277311 optical density,
po0.05). This means that Mino and SO group may protect
against the delayed expansion of the infarct through secondary oxidative injury caused by activated astrocytes and
reactive gliosis.
The cell survival of neurons was represented by NeuN
positive cells. All drug-treated groups showed a higher
number of NeuN positive cells compared to the control group
(Fig. 4). Especially, Mino group showed a signiﬁcantly higher

87

number of NeuN positive cells compared to the SO group
(Con: 3473, Mino: 73715, SO: 62713 cells/mm2, po0.05).
Apoptotic cells were recognized by identiﬁcation of DNA
fragmentation using TUNEL method (Fig. 5). All treated
groups had reduced TUNEL-positive cells compared to control
group (Con: 148721, Mino: 96720, SO: 118714 cell/mm2,
po0.05). Mino group showed a signiﬁcantly decreased number of TUNEL positive cells compared to SO group.

Discussion

In ischemic brains, an increased chemokine mRNA expression displays a biphasic proﬁle, initially being found in
neurons and then subsequently found in astrocytes (Wang
et al., 1998). Accumulation of macrophage/microglia is found
in areas of gliosis surrounding recent infarcts (Flynn et al.,
2003). Reperfusion activates the arachidonic cascade, leading
to the production of excessive amounts of TXA2, which is a
metabolite of arachidonic acid (Gaudet et al., 1980; Petroni
et al., 1989). The arachidonic cascade also is one of the
production pathways for free radicals (Simonian and Coyle,
1996).
There are several studies that minocycline or ozagrel are
effective post-ischemic stroke treatments. Minocycline is
reported to have neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischemia or intracerebral hemorrhage in animal models of stroke
(Fox et al., 2005; Yrjanheikki et al., 1999). In addition to their
known antibiotic properties, tetracyclines also have been
shown to have anti-inﬂammatory properties in a variety of
cells and tissues. Minocycline treatment reduces the amount
of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible NO synthase, prostaglandin E2
and interleukin-1β in models of neuronal damage (Chen et al.,
2000; Du et al., 2001). This effect may be caused by actions of
minocycline on suppression of microglial activation (Du et al.,
2001). Cerebral ischemia results in a localized secondary

inﬂammation that can signiﬁcantly contribute to the ﬁnal
outcome. Reduction of this ischemia-induced inﬂammation
by minocycline may contribute to damage reduction and
functional recovery enhancement. Furthermore, the results
of the current study demonstrate the promising therapeutic
potential of minocycline in stroke.
Ozagrel has been widely used for the treatment of thrombotic or lacunar stroke over the last few years. It is a TXA2
synthase inhibitor, modulates the arachidonic acid cascade
thereby reducing TXA2 and increases PGI2 (Chen et al., 1986).
TXA2 is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation and a
vasoconstrictor and PGI2 is a strong inhibitor of platelet
aggregation and a vasodilator. Ozagrel administration
improves the balance of PGI2/TXA2 during the acute phase
of cerebral ischemia.
The present study demonstrates that a single dose of
minocycline or ozagrel prior to MCAO exerted the direct
protection against ischemic stroke in neurons. Previous
articles reported that the risk of high intensity lesion on
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) after cerebral angiography

ranges from 9% to 29% (Kato et al., 2003). Temporary cerebral
blood ﬂow occlusion is needed in several cerebrovascular
procedures like CEA, balloon angioplasty, stenting, or bypass
surgery. Sometimes these procedures cause cerebral ischemia or stroke. In case of CEA or carotid stenting, perioperative
ischemic complication rates are reported as 3–24% (Asai et al.,
2013). Previous articles have reported that patients who
underwent neuro-interventional procedures carry a greater
risk of presentation of high-intensity lesion on DWI, which
ranges from 51.3% to 61% (Soeda et al., 2003).
Preventive administration of neuroprotective agent in
high risk patients can minimize the damage by stroke.
Several agents were introduced for an intraoperative cerebral
protection like barbiturate, calcium channel blocker (CCB)
and NO synthase inhibitor. However, barbiturate frequently
causes respiratory depression on locally anesthetized
patients and CCB cause hypotension with weak neuroprotective effect. The prevention of a reperfusion injury is an
important therapeutic target for stroke. Moreover, intracerebral hemorrhage of basal ganglia and hyperperfusion brain

swelling are not rare after reperfusion of MCAO. Blood brain
barrier (BBB) breakdown may play an important role in these
reperfusion injuries. Minocycline or ozagrel can be another

intraoperative cerebral protection agent although these
agents have minor side effects such as headache, nausea,
elevated liver enzyme and others.

In case of endovascular thromboembolectomy or thrombolysis for acute stroke caused by major artery occlusion,
occluded vessel selection with microcatheter is a ﬁrst step for
the recanalization procedure. It takes a great deal of time
from the selection of the occluded vessel to the successful
recanalization. An intra-arterial injection of minocycline or
ozagrel in the occluded vessel would be helpful to prevent the
progression of an infarct core until recanalization and reperfusion injury.
Minocycline and ozagrel decreased the total volume of
infarction. We think that minocycline or ozagrel target the
ischemic rim and prevent microthrombi formation and
further aggravation in the rim by suppressing the platelet
activity and inﬂammatory enzymes along with edema and
vasoconstriction, ultimately resulting in a smaller infarct
volume. TCC staining is a simple and widely used method
for the detection of infarction, with the non-stained part
indicating the infarction. The weakly stained area, which
situated adjacent to the non-stained part in each slice,
seemed to include both surviving cells and dead cells. Thus,
this part seemed likely to be the penumbra. The above results
suggest that minocycline or ozagrel prevented cell death in
the penumbra and suppressed an enlargement of infarct core.
A smaller margin of improvement with diminished drug
delivery could be the reason for ineffectiveness in the delayed
administration. Thus, early administration before temporary
block of cerebral circulation would be helpful to prevent an
unexpected ischemic injury.
There were some differences in the effectiveness between
minocycline and ozagrel and these differences seem likely to
be related to their differing in the diversity of effects.
Minocycline have been reported to suppress free radicals in
the ischemic period and to have more multiple effects than
ozagrel (Tomas-Camardiel et al., 2004). Ozagrel has been
reported to suppress the decrease of cerebral blood ﬂow but
not to have an effect on free radicals (Pettigrew et al., 1989).

Conclusions

In the present study, both minocycline and ozagrel showed
smaller infarct volume, more neuronal survival, fewer astrocyte activation and apoptosis in addition to more improvement of behavioral disability than the control group when
administered prior to ischemia. It suggests that minocycline
and ozagrel attribute to neuroprotective effects in MCAO rat
models. Additional to post-ischemic therapy, it will be useful
to prevent cerebral ischemia in multiple cerebrovascular
procedures.

housed in temperature–humidity and light–dark controlled
rooms, and allowed food and tap water ad libitum. Animals
were assigned randomly to one of the following three groups:
(1) the ﬁrst group of rats was treated with saline as the
control group (n ¼10, Con group), (2) the second group was
injected with minocycline (n¼ 10, Mino group), and (3) the
third group was injected with sodium ozagrel (n¼ 10, SO
group).

5.2.

Minocycline (Sigma, Inc. St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared by
dissolving in 0.9% saline as 4 mg/ml. Ozagrel (Kissei Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Matsumoto, Japan) was prepared by dissolving in 0.9% saline as 5 mg/ml. Minocycline (45 mg/kg) and
ozagrel (5 mg/kg) were intravenously administrated to the tail
vein at 30 min before performing the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) in the rat models.

5.3.

Experimental procedures

5.1.

Animals

All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with
the animal experimental guideline established by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Catholic University
Medical School (CIMH 2012-005). Male Sprague-Dawley rats
(270–300 g) aged 10–12 weeks old were used. The rats were

MCAO model

Transient MCAO was induced as described by Longa et al.
(1989) with a minor modiﬁcation.
Under inhalation anesthesia with isoﬂurane, the right
common carotid artery (CCA) and the external carotid artery
(ECA) were exposed through a midline incision. The occipital
artery and the superior thyroid artery were dissected and
coagulated. The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was
exposed and the pterygopalatine artery was ligated. Two
loose ties (5–0 silk suture) were made around the ECA stump
and tightened the distal tie. A small puncture opening was
made in the ECA and 3–0 monoﬁlament (intraluminal suture
with a rounded tip) was inserted through the opening and the
silk suture was tightened around the lumen containing the
ﬁlament. The monoﬁlament was gently advanced into the
ICA for a distance of 19 to 20 mm beyond bifurcation until it
blocked the bifurcating origin of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The body temperature was maintained at 37 1C using
heating pad during the procedure.
The animal was allowed to regain consciousness and
checked to determine whether the MCA was successfully
occluded by placing the animal on a ﬂat surface, lifting it by
the base of the tail 2 in. off the surface and observing its
behavior. When the MCA is successfully occluded, rats
exhibit marked thorax twisting when suspended by its tail.
Contralateral forepaw ﬂexure should also be observed. Ninety
minutes after the occlusion, animals were reanesthetized
and reperfused by removing the suture and the ECA was
ligated.

Drug administration

Behavior evaluation

Behavioral functions were evaluated with adhesive removal
and treadmill test at 1, 3 and 7 days after MCAO. All animals
were trained three times for a week before MCAO. A square
dot of adhesive-backed paper (12Ø) was used in the adhesive
removal test as bilateral tactile stimuli occupying the distal
radial region on the wrist of each forelimb. Animals were
given three trials with a cut-off time of 180 s. The data are
presented as mean time to remove the left dot. The treadmill

brain research 1599 (2015) 85–92

was accelerated from 20 to 80 m/min with a cut-off time of
300 s.

5.5.

Infarct volume

At 7 days after MCAO, all rats (n¼ 10, for each group) were
sacriﬁced under deep anesthesia with 5% halothane. The
brain was dissected out and ﬁve 2 mm thick coronal slices
were prepared using a rodent brain matrix. The slices were
stained a 2% solution of 2-3-5-triphenylterazolium chloride
(TCC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 1C for 15 min. The
infarct area was measured using image analyzing software
(MetaMorph, Molecular Devices Inc., Downingtown, PA, USA),
determined by using the method of subtracting the area of
the non-infarct ipsilateral hemisphere from that of the
contralateral tissue to reduce errors that might occur due to
cerebral edema.

5.6.

Immunohistoﬂuorescence staining

The tissue was coronally cut at a thickness of 12 mm with
0.1 mm of boundary area of cerebral infarct in the precentral
gyrus, located 24 mm posterior to the frontal pole from each
rat for 20 min and washed with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered
solution (PBS) for 10 min. Sections were blocked in normal
goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were
incubated with mouse antibody to glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (GFAP, Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA, diluted at
1:200) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN, Millipore, Inc., Billerica,
MA, USA, diluted at 1:100) overnight at 4 1C. Subsequently,
sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
Alexa 488-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Southﬁeld, MI, USA, diluted at 1:200). After washing,
the sections were counterstained and stored at 20 1C and
then observed under both a ﬂuorescence microscope
equipped with a spot digital camera and a confocal scanning
laser microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Apoptosis
was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay by means of the in situ
cell death detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) developed using the Cy2-conjugated streptavidin observed by
confocal scanning laser microscope. The ischemia penumbra
was determined by optical density of GFAP, NeuN and TUNEL
positive cells using the MetaMorph imaging program (Molecular Device Inc., Downingtown, PA, USA).
