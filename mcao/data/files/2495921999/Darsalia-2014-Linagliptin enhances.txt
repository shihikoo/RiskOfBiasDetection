Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are current drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on
their main property to enhance endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels, thus increasing insulin
secretion. However, the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibition in extra pancreatic tissues has been poorly
investigated and it might occur differently from that induced by GLP-1R agonists.
Increased adult neurogenesis by GLP-1R agonists has been suggested to play a role in functional recovery in
animal models of brain disorders. We recently showed that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin reduces brain damage
after stroke in normal and type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether linagliptin
impacts stroke-induced neurogenesis.
T2D was induced by 25 weeks of high-fat diet. Linagliptin treatment was carried out for 7 weeks. Standard diet
fed-mice were used as controls. Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion 4 weeks into the
linagliptin treatment. Neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation/neuroblast formation and striatal neurogenesis/
gliogenesis were assessed 3 weeks after stroke. The effect of linagliptin on NSC viability was also determined
in vitro.
The results show that linagliptin enhances NSC proliferation in T2D mice but not in normal mice. Linagliptin did
not increase NSC number in vitro indicating that the effect of linagliptin on NSC proliferation in T2D is indirect.
Neurogenesis and gliogenesis were not affected.
In conclusion, we found no correlation between acute neuroprotection (occurring in both T2D and normal mice)
and increased NSC proliferation (occurring only in T2D mice). However, our results show that linagliptin evokes a
differential response on NSC proliferation after stroke in normal and T2D mice suggesting that DPP-4 inhibition
effect in the CNS might go beyond the well known increase of GLP-1.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death and adult disability. Type 2 diabetes
(T2D) strongly increases the risk of premature and severe stroke and
stroke mortality [1,2]. Stroke patients with hyperglycemia at hospital admission generally show a poorer prognosis than non-diabetic individuals
[1,3].

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted
from enteroendocrine L-cells following a meal [4–6]. GLP-1 enhances
glucose-dependent insulin secretion via the speciﬁc G-protein-coupled
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) [7]. However, GLP-1 has a very short half-life
mainly due to its rapid degradation by the proteolytic enzyme
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) [4]. The proteolytic removal of two single amino acids from the GLP-1N-terminus prevents GLP-1 from activating its receptor [8]. Consequently, GLP-1 as such is not a suitable drug
candidate. To pharmacologically harness GLP-1 in the treatment of
T2D and increase GLP-1 levels in the blood, stable GLP-1 analogues or
mimetics and DPP-4 inhibitors have been developed [7,9–11].
Linagliptin is one of several DPP-4 inhibitors currently available in the
clinic against T2D. Linagliptin is a potent and long-acting molecule [12,
13] which is rapidly absorbed upon oral administration and highly

26

selective for DPP-4, reducing its plasma activity by N80% over 24 h [13,
14]. Unlike other DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin is mainly undergoing
enterohepatic elimination, which is an advantage in T2D patients with
nephropathy [15].
Neuroprotection conferred by GLP-1R agonists is established (see reviews [16–20]). GLP-1 and GLP-1R agonists have been shown to cross
the blood–brain-barrier [21,22] and directly enhance neuronal survival
since GLP-1R expression in the brain largely seems restricted to neurons
[23–26]. On the other hand, indirect mechanisms may also contribute to
the beneﬁcial CNS effects of GLP-1R activation, including improved glycemia, reduced blood pressure, ameliorated endothelial dysfunction
[27], and reduced brain inﬂammation [28,29]. Another potential mechanisms by which GLP-1R activation could produce beneﬁcial effects in
the CNS is through the regulation of neurogenesis [30]. Stroke induces
neurogenesis in both rodents and humans. Adult neural stem cells
(NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) generate neuroblasts that
differentiate into neurons after migrating to the olfactory bulb [30].
Following stroke, a portion of these neuroblasts can migrate into
striatum and replace dead neurons [31,32] suggesting that this process
could play a role in functional recovery after stroke [33]. Interestingly,
we and others have shown that GLP-1R agonists enhance adult
neurogenesis in both normal and diabetic mice and rat models [34–39].
DPP-4 inhibition for the treatment of brain disorders is an emerging
therapeutic concept. Recent studies have shown that the DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin and alogliptin exert neuroprotective effects in experimental Alzheimer and stroke models [40–42]. Recently, we showed
that linagliptin is also neuroprotective in an animal model of stroke in
T2D and in non-diabetic mice, independently of its glycemic effects
[23]. Additionally, a human phase 3 study showed that patients with
T2D had a reduced stroke incidence after linagliptin treatment [43].
Although DPP-4 inhibitors act via GLP-1 to stimulate insulin secretion,
it is not known whether neuroprotection mediated by DPP-4 inhibitors
occur through the same mechanism of action. In fact, DPP-4 inhibitors
also modulate the activity of several other factors acting in CNS [44–47].
The potential effect of DPP-4 inhibition on adult neurogenesis has
not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin on NSC proliferation, neurogenesis and
gliogenesis after stroke in both normal and diabetic mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals, experimental design
Fourteen male C57Bl6/J mice (Nova SCB Stockholm, Sweden) were
used in the in vivo experiments. High-fat diet (HFD) was given for
32 weeks until mice were sacriﬁced. At week 25 the linagliptin treatment was initiated and carried out for seven weeks till week 32. Standard diet fed-mice were used as controls. At week 29, stroke was
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (see below). Linagliptin
(Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Biberach, Germany)
was administered peri-orally by a gavage needle once daily at the
dose of 10 mg/kg (n = 7) and vehicle (n = 7) was used as control.
To assess neurogenesis and gliogenesis, all animals were also given
daily injections of the thymidine analog BrdU (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal)
for two weeks following MCAO.
Brains were analyzed after sacriﬁce at week 32.
The experimental design, the model of HFD-mediated induction of a
diabetic phenotype, the neuroprotetctive effect of linagliptin against
stroke and its effects on glycemia have been recently described [23].
For the in vitro experiments with NSC, ten six-week old males
C57Bl6/J (Nova SCB Stockholm, Sweden) were used.
All animal experiments were conducted under standardized housing
conditions and according to the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH
publication #85-23, revised 1985) and approved by the regional ethics
committee for animal experimentation (S-713, S1710, S72-12).

2.2. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
The intraluminal ﬁlament model of focal ischemia [48] was used to
induce stroke 4 weeks into the linagliptin/vehicle treatment as recently
described [23]. All animals received linagliptin or vehicle treatment 1 h
before surgery. Anesthesia was induced by 3% isoﬂurane and continued
during surgery with 1.5% isoﬂurane using a snout mask. Brieﬂy, the
carotid arteries on the left side were exposed, the external carotid was
ligated and temporary sutures were placed over the common carotid
artery. Through a small surgical incision in the external carotid artery,
a 7–0 monoﬁlament coated with silicone was advanced via the internal
carotid artery until it blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery.
When the ﬁlament had been correctly positioned, wounds were closed
and anesthesia was discontinued. After a 30 min ischemic occlusion
time, the mice were re-anesthetized, the ﬁlament was withdrawn, and
the ligatures were gently removed from the common carotid artery to
regain blood ﬂow. Body temperature was stabilized between 36 and
38 °C using a heating lamp and during anesthesia and ischemia. The
mice were transferred to a heated box where they recovered under
heat and supervision for 2 h. The surgeon was blinded to the treatment
groups in these experiments.
2.3. Brain immunocytochemistry and cell quantiﬁcations
Animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with
4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted and submersed
in 20% sucrose in phosphate buffer overnight. 40-μm-thick coronal sections were cut throughout the brain using a sliding microtome and
stained as free-ﬂoating sections. The following primary antibodies
were used: mouse anti-Ki67 (1:200 dilution; Novocastra), a marker
of cell proliferation; goat anti-DCX (doublecortin) (1:400 dilution;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a marker for migrating neuroblasts; mouse
anti-NeuN (1:100 dilution; Millipore), a neuronal marker; and rabbit
anti-s100b (Millipore 1:100); a marker of astrocytes. A rat anti-BrdU
(1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody in combination
with anti-NeuN and anti-s100b was employed to assess neurogenesis
and gliogenesis, respectively. Sections were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C in a phosphate buffer containing 3% appropriate serum and 0.25% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were detected
by use of biotin- or Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated (Vector)
secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution). Sections were incubated with
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature (approx. 21 °C) in
phosphate buffer containing 3% of the appropriate serum and 0.25%
Triton X-100. For chromogenic visualization, biotinylated secondary
antibodies, avidin–biotin complex (ABC kit; Vector) and diaminobenzidine were used.
The cells were counted using the bright ﬁeld or the epi-ﬂuorescent
microscope. Three consecutive brain sections spaced at 320 μm containing striatum (from Bregma 1 to 0.5 mm) were used for cell counting.
The ﬁrst section was chosen based on an anatomical location along
the rostra-caudal axis (≈ 1 mm from Bregma). The second and the
third sections were 320 and 640 μm caudally from the ﬁrst section
respectively.
2.3.1. Cell cultures and adult neural stem cell viability and proliferation
assays
The SVZ of the lateral brain ventricles from ﬁve mice was microdissected and enzymatically dissociated and the cells were isolated
and expanded as described by Mansouri et al. [49]. Neurospheres
were split every ﬁve days for four weeks and all experiments were
performed between passages 2 and 5.
To measure adult neural stem cell (NSC) viability, NSC were seeded as
single cells into 96-well plates (Corning B.V. Life Sciences, Amsterdam,
Netherlands) at the ﬁnal concentration of 50,000 cells/well in Dulbecco's
modiﬁed Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with B27 and in 10 μg/L of
epidermal growth factor (EGF). Under these conditions NSC viability

V. Darsalia et al. / Regulatory Peptides 190–191 (2014) 25–31

and proliferation can be assessed [49]. Linagliptin 0.1 nM, 10 nM and
1 μM were added to the NSCs for 24 h. Pituitary adenylate cyclaseactivating polypeptide 38 (PACAP 38) 100 nM (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
Burlingame, CA) was used as internal control in these experiments. After
24 h of incubation at 37 °C (5% CO2, 98% humidity), intracellular ATP
levels (which correlate with cell number [50]) were measured using
the Cellular ATP Kit HTS according to the manufacturer's instructions
(BioThema, Stockholm, Sweden). In these experiments, the effect of
each treatment at a certain concentration was determined in octuplicates
in three different sets of experiments.
To measure NSC proliferation in response to linagliptin, 3H-thymidine
incorporation into DNA was assessed. Neurospheres were dissociated to
a single-cell suspension and plated as single cells in 6-well plates
(1,000,000 cells/well). The effect of each treatment was determined in
duplicates in four sets of experiments. Linagliptin (10 nM) or PACAP
(100 nM) was added to the cells and the cells were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. 3H-thymidine (1 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences; Piscataway,
NJ) was present from after plating till when the cells were harvested 24 h
later. Cells were harvested and radioactivity was measured using a
microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Wallac MicroBeta®
Trilux; PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA)
2.4. Statistics
In the in vivo experiments, statistical analysis for the Ki67 outcome
measurement was performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) between the four groups (n = 7 in each group). After
ANOVA test showed signiﬁcant results, the Tukey's post-hoc test
among the four groups was performed. For the DCX, BrdU/NeuN and
BrdU/S100-beta outcome measurements, unpaired t-test was used
between vehicle-treated (n = 7) and linagliptin-treated (n = 7) HFDfed animals. Normality of randomization into different treatment
groups was tested using the Shapiro–Wilks normality test.
For the in vitro part of the study, we performed three ATP assay experiments in which cells were plated in octuplicates for each treatment
condition (control, linagliptin 0.1 nM, linagliptin 1 nM, linagliptin 10 nM
and PACAP). For the proliferation assay (3H-thymidine incorporation)
we performed four sets of experiments where the cells were plated in
duplicates for each treatment condition (control, linagliptin 10 nM,
PACAP). This implied that we had twenty-four observations for each
treatment condition in the ATP experiments (n = 24 in each group)
and eight observations for each treatment condition in the 3Hthymidine experiments (n = 8 in each group). We compared the treatments by using one-way ANOVA after normalizing linagliptin and
PACAP values on their control in each experiment. Normalization in
each experiment was done by taking the average value of the observations in the control group and all the observations in the same experiment were divided by this value. If ANOVA showed signiﬁcant results,
Tukey's post-hoc test among all possible treatments for ATP levels and
3H-Thymidine incorporation outcomes was performed. Differences between groups were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P b 0.05.
Data are presented as means ± SEM.

mice [mean = 454 Ki67+ cells in vehicle HFD vs. mean = 610 Ki67+
cells in linagliptin HFD; p b 0.05] (Fig. 1A). This effect by linagliptin
could not be recorded in normal non diabetic mice (mean = 525
Ki67 + cells in vehicle standard diet vs. mean = 531 Ki67 + cells in
linagliptin standard diet p N 0.05] (Fig. 1A). The number of Ki-67 +
cells was also increased by linagliptin in the SVZ contralateral to stroke
in T2D mice [mean = 415 Ki67+ cells in vehicle HFD vs. mean = 562
Ki67 + cells in linagliptin HFD; p b 0.01], but not in normal mice
[mean = 518 Ki67 + cells in vehicle standard diet vs. mean = 451
Ki67+ cells in linagliptin standard diet; p b 0.05] (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Neuroblast production, neurogenesis and gliogenesis are not altered by
the linagliptin treatment in HFD-fed diabetic mice
To determine whether linagliptin modulated neurogenesis after
stroke in HFD-fed diabetic mice we took advantage of the speciﬁc
neuroblast marker doublecortin (DCX) in immunohistochemical (IHC)
quantitative experiments. The results in Fig. 2A show that the linagliptin
treatment led to a trend toward the reduction of DCX-positive cells
albeit the effect did not reach statistical signiﬁcance in the ipsilateral
to stroke striatum [mean = 300 DCX + cells in vehicle vs. mean =
128 DCX + cells in linagliptin-treated mice; p N 0.05]. Double labeling
for the neuronal marker NeuN and BrdU was used to identify
mature neurons that were generated after stroke in striatum. To
assess gliogenesis in striatum, double labeling for the astrocyte
marker S100-beta and BrdU was employed. Neither neurogenesis
(Fig. 2B) [mean = 3 Neun/Brdu + cells in vehicle vs. mean = 2,4
Neun/BrdU + cells in linagliptin-treated mice; p N 0.05] nor gliogenesis
(Fig. 2C) [mean = 27 S100-beta/BrdU + cells in vehicle vs. mean =
39 S100-beta/BrdU + cells in linagliptin-treated mice; p N 0.05] were
impacted by the linagliptin treatment in HFD-fed diabetic mice. In the
attempt to assess changes in the inﬂammatory response after stroke,
we also quantiﬁed microglial cell number by counting Iba-1 positive
cells in the stroke hemisphere. However, no effect was detected (data
not shown).
3.3. Linagliptin does not increase NSC number in vitro
Direct neuroprotective effect mediated by DPP-4 inhibition has been
recently reported [40]. To determine the potential direct effect of
linagliptin on adult NSC number, intracellular ATP levels were assessed
after 24 h in culture. In this assay, increased NSC viability by the neuropeptides PACAP has been recently shown [51]. Thus, we used PACAP as
internal control. The results in Fig. 3A show that linagliptin at 0.1 nM
(mean ATP % of control = 103), 10 nM (mean ATP % of control =
100) and 1 μM (mean ATP % of control = 102) (linagliptin IC50 1nM
[12]) did not increase NSC number in comparison with control
(p N 0.05) while PACAP did (mean ATP % of control = 131, p b 0.001).
To assess NSC proliferation, 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA
was assessed. The results in Fig. 3B show that linagliptin 10 nM
(mean 3H-thymidine incorporation % of control = 96) did not modify
3
H-thymidine incorporation in comparison with control (p N 0.05).
Also in this case, PACAP was used as internal control for the assay [52]
and it elicited a statistically signiﬁcant response (mean 3H-thymidine
incorporation % of control = 129; p b 0.05).

3.1. Linagliptin enhances NSC proliferation after stroke in diabetic, but not
in normal, mice

4. Discussion

To study the effect of linagliptin on NSC proliferation, Ki67expressing cells were counted in the ipsilateral SVZ three weeks after
stroke by using stereological methods (see Methods). HFD per se did
not impact NSC proliferation in ipsilateral to stroke SVZ, although a
trend toward a decrease of NSC proliferation was recorded [mean =
525 Ki67+ cells in vehicle standard diet vs. mean = 454 Ki67+ cells
in vehicle HFD; p N 0.05] (Fig. 1A). However, the results show that
linagliptin signiﬁcantly increased NSC proliferation in HFD-fed diabetic

Neuroprotective effects mediated by DPP-4 inhibitors start to be
uncovered (see Introduction). However, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms behind these effects are largely uncharacterized and may
at least in part differ from those mediated by GLP-1R agonists [45].
Stroke induces neurogenesis in both rodents and humans and this
process has been suggested to play a role in functional recovery [33].
Whether this is a causal link, rather than a correlation, remains to be
proven [53]. Since we showed previously that linagliptin reduces

acute brain damage after stroke [23], in this work we studied whether
the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin had the potential to regulate NSC proliferation, neurogenesis and gliogenesis after stroke in non-diabetic and
T2D mice. Our ﬁndings show that as reported by Rivera et al. HFD per
se did not impact NSC proliferation [54]. We show that linagliptin treatment signiﬁcantly increased NSC proliferation in the SVZ of HFD-fed
diabetic mice at three weeks after stroke, whereas it was not effective
in non-diabetic mice. Since linagliptin showed similar anti-stroke efﬁcacy both in normal and HFD-fed diabetic mice [23], our data do not indicate any correlation between acute neuroprotection and the brain
regenerative response induced by the linagliptin treatment. In HFDfed diabetic mice, despite increased NSC proliferation, we did not ﬁnd
more newly generated neurons and astrocytes at three weeks after
stroke. Neurogenesis after stroke is rather dynamic and observation at
a single time-point may not be representing the whole process. Stem
cell proliferation increases within the ﬁrst 2 weeks after stroke and
then is back to normal values at 6 weeks after stroke [31,55–58]. At
3 weeks after stroke we were able to quantify an increase of cell proliferation (Ki67) by linagliptin. Increase in proliferation at 3 weeks was
similar on both ipsilateral and contralateral to stroke SVZ of HFD mice.
This indicates that linagliptin increased SVZ cell proliferation independently of stroke in HFD-fed diabetic mice. Neurogenesis (DCX, NeuN)
was not affected; therefore at least at three weeks after stroke,
linagliptin does not impact stroke-induced neurogenesis.
Our experimental design did not allow us to answer the question
whether the NSCs increased by linagliptin would survive long-term,

differentiate in neurons and have a functional impact through neuronal
replacement or other means (anti-inﬂammatory action, enhanced
plasticity, etc.). These questions remain to be investigated.
Direct neuroprotective effects of DPP-4 inhibitors delivered intracerebrally have been recently reported [40]. However, linagliptin does not
cross the intact blood–brain barrier [59] and thus the brain DPP-4 activity is most likely unaffected once linaglipin is given peripherally as in
our study. In addition, although the distribution of linagliptin in the
brain following stroke (with consequent blood brain–barrier damage)
is not known, linagliptin has a very tight binding to DPP-4 resulting in
low plasma steady state levels. Thus linagliptin, at the oral dose we
used, will unlikely reach the brain parenchyma even after stroke. This
suggests that our observed increase of NSC activation in HFD-fed diabetic mice is indirect as also recently suggested by D'Amico et al. [42]. These
results are also supported by our in vitro ﬁnding showing that linagliptin
could not directly impact NSC survival and proliferation. Peripherally
delivered GLP-1R agonists have been shown to increase NSC proliferation and neurogenesis [34–39] and neuroprotection (see reviews
[16–20]) in both normal and diabetic mice). Since linagliptin was ineffective in regulating NSC proliferation in normal mice, our data suggest
that DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1R agonists act differently in the brain
and/or that GLP-1R agonists are more potent. These data are not entirely
surprising. Although DPP-4 inhibitors are well known for their GLP-1mediated effects in the pancreas, they have been also reported to modulate multiple factors, among them neurogenic factors which are direct
DPP-4 substrates, e.g. gastric inhibitory polypeptide GIP, neuropeptide Y

and stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) [44–47,60,61]. We speculate
that the differential effect of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1R agonists in
regulating neurogenesis could be explained by the fact that GLP-1R agonists are given at high pharmacological doses (nM levels) able to fully
target GLP-1R. On the contrary, peripheral GLP-1 following DPP-4 inhibition results in lower levels of GLP-1 (in pM range) [62]. These levels
could even be lower in the CNS depending of the GLP-1 amounts able
to pass the blood–brain barrier. Thus, the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors in
the brain might not occur only via GLP-1 but more likely also via the

regulation of other neurogeneic and neurotrophic factors that are direct
substrates of DPP-4. If this hypothesis is correct, the next step will be to
determine the difference in the regulation of these factors by DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetic versus non-diabetic mice. These ﬁndings could have
implications in therapeutic perspective.
In conclusion, we found no correlation between acute neuroprotection against stroke conferred by linagliptin (occurring in both HFD-fed
diabetic and normal mice) and increased NSC proliferation (occurring
only in HFD-fed diabetic mice). However, we provided new insights of

the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibition in the brain by showing
that linagliptin treatment leads to differential effects on NSC in normal
versus diabetic mice. Whether the speciﬁc activation of NSC by DPP-4
inhibitors in diabetes could prove beneﬁcial in long-term recovery of
impaired neurological function in stroke patients with T2D remain to
be determined.
