ABSTRACT. We explored the relationship between MK-801 concentration
and neural stem cell proliferation in rats with focal cerebral ischemiareperfusion (FCIR). A total of 60 male Sprague Dawley rats were
randomized into control (six rats), sham-operation (six rats), operation (12
rats), and MK-801 groups. The MK-801 group comprised 36 rats that were
subjected to different doses of MK-801 (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2
mg/kg). Suture occlusion was used to establish an ischemia reperfusion
model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); 30 min before
establishing the FCIR model, the MK-801 group rats were intraperitoneally
injected with different doses of MK-801, while the sham-operation and
control groups were injected with normal saline. Seven days after model
establishment, bromodeoxyuridine-positive cerebral cortex cells adjacent
to the focus of infarction were labeled for immunohistochemistry. MK-801
at a concentration of 0.4 mg/kg prevented endogenous neural stem cell
proliferation, and this inhibitory effect was strengthened with increasing
MK-801 concentration, especially at concentrations greater than 0.8 mg/
kg. MK-801 inhibits endogenous neural stem cell proliferation in rats with

INTRODUCTION
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are precursor cells that are capable of self-proliferation and
multidirectional differentiation (Gage, 2000). Their proliferation and differentiation processes are
considered a simplified model of nerve development and regeneration. Since Anderson and
Michelsohn (1989) first put forward the concept of NSCs and experimentally confirmed their
existence in 1989, exogenous and endogenous NSCs have been extensively investigated. Owing
to low transplant survival rate and difficulty in differentiation control of exogenous NSCs, as well
as ethical issues concerning NSC sources, endogenous NSCs have been the focus of cerebral
infarction treatment. Research has demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
antagonists can reduce the area of cerebral infarction and protect neurons. Simultaneously,
excitatory amino acids (EAAs) can activate endogenous NSCs through NMDA receptors, and
promote their proliferation and differentiation to repair neurological function. Therefore, the control
of NMDA receptor activation to achieve the best balance between neuron protection and activation
of endogenous NSCs requires investigation. We performed intervention through intraperitoneal
injection of NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. We then observed nestin-positive cells in the cortex
adjacent to the focus of infarction using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and explored the relationship
between MK-801 concentration and activation of endogenous NSCs to provide a laboratory basis
for clinical treatment and prevention of cerebral infarction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Animals and grouping
Sixty male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were randomized into nine groups
as follows: 6 normal controls; 6 sham-operation controls; 12 operation controls; and 36 MK-801treated rats given different doses of MK-801 (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mg/kg). The MK-801
was provided by Shenzhen Jingmei Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). MK-801 at different
concentrations was injected intraperitoneally into rats 30 min before operation. Rats were sacrificed
on day 7 after operation. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Xinxiang Medical University.

Establishment of experimental model
Vascular occlusion using a nylon suture was performed in the rats to establish a rat model
of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), according to the advanced protocol proposed by
Longa et al. (1989). Rats were anesthetized by ip administration of 10% chloral hydrate (3 mL/
kg), fixed in the supine position, and incised in the midline of the neck. The left common carotid

artery (CCA), the internal carotid artery (ICA), and the external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed.
The branches of the CCA and the ECA close to the heart were ligated with a nylon suture. A nylon
suture was introduced into the ICA lumen through a micro-incision 5 mm from the branch of the
CCA. The introduction was stopped after approximately 19 mm of nylon suture had been inserted
and resistance felt, at which point the tip of the suture reached the origin of the middle cerebral
artery (MCA) and caused occlusion. The MK-801 or the saline was ip injected immediately after the
operation. After 2 h, the rats were anesthetized with diethyl ether, all occlusion was removed, and
10 mm of nylon suture was withdrawn gently to restore blood flow. In the sham-operation controls,
only 10 mm of nylon suture was inserted into the ICA lumen, but the rest of the procedure was
the same as described above. A successful rat model includes indications of: 1) contralateral limb
paralysis; 2) a positive result from the tail-hanging test; 3) reduced ipsilateral eye fissure; exclude
non-standard rats; and 4) infarction and cerebral ischemic injury.

TTC staining
The rats from each group were anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation 24 h after
ischemia-reperfusion; the brains were instantly harvested and frozen. After 20 min, five 2-μm thick
coronal sections backward from the forehead pole were made using a tissue slicer, incubated in
TCC staining solution (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C for 30 min, then
fixed in fresh 10% formaldehyde for at least 24 h. Following TCC staining, normal brain tissue is red
while infarction tissue is white. The successful model was characterized by white cerebral infarction
lesions located in the cortex and striatum and overlapped by the MCA dominant region.

Preparation of histological slices
At indicated time points, the rats were ip anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and positioned
on the dissection table. The left ventricle was intubated after the thoracotomy, washed with cool saline
to remove blood, fixed overnight with cool 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer, further immersed
in 20 and 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer successively, and stored at 4°C until required. Frozen
consecutive coronal slices (10-μm thick) were taken from the temporal lobe, and take one of each four
was used for conventional Nissl staining, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) IHC, and for the negative control.

IHC of BrdU
BrdU staining was carried out using the streptavidin-biotin complex method (BrdU was
provided by Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering Company, Wuhan, China). Briefly, slices were
washed twice with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, for 5 min, and immersed in
0.3% H2O2 PBS solution for 15 min to deactivate endogenous peroxidase and enhance antibody
detection sensitivity, and then normal calf serum (1:20 dilution) was added to the slices at 37°C
for 30 min; the excess liquid was discarded and primary mouse anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody
(1:100 dilution, Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering Company) was added to the slices overnight
at 4°C (with further incubation at 37°C for 1 h if necessary). Incubation with biotin-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering Company) at 37°C for 30 min was followed
by development with a 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-H2O2 kit (Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering
Company) for 20-30 min. During each step, except removal of the calf serum and addition of the
primary antibody, slices were washed three times with 0.01 M PBS for 5 min. Finally, the slices were

dehydrated conventionally, made transparent, and sealed with coverslips. The negative control was
prepared by following the same procedure except that the primary antibody was replaced with PBS.

Imaging analysis
A HPIAS-2000 imaging analysis system (OLMPUS company in Japan) was applied to
analyze the images of the cortex adjacent to the infarctions at 200X magnification. For quantification
of BrdU-positive cells in per field, each slide was quantified by 15 power fields in the same area.

Statistical analysis
The Student t-test and analysis of variance were performed to compare the difference in
positive cell numbers in each group. P < 0.01 was considered to be significant.

RESULTS
BrdU-positive cells, characterized by deeply stained nuclei in round cells, were barely
observed in the cerebral cortexes and occasionally in the granule cell layers of the cortex in the control
and sham-operation groups. Seven days after model establishment, IHC revealed that BrdU-positive
cells in the operation and MK-801 groups were round, oval, spindle-shaped, or triangular and of
different sizes in irregular arrangements. In addition, BrdU-positive cells massed, cytoskeletal structure
in the infarctions was destroyed, neurons swelled, intercellular spaces widened, and disruption and
apoptosis of the neurons were observed. The differences in the number of BrdU-positive cells were not
significant between pairs of adjacent groups: the operation group, the 0.2-mg/kg group, the 0.4-mg/kg
group, and the 0.6-mg/kg group (P > 0.01), which indicated that the change of MK-801 concentration
between pairs of adjacent groups did not correlate with the degree of inhibition of positive cell
proliferation. However, the t-test showed significant differences between pairs of nonadjacent groups
(P < 0.01). The numbers of BrdU-positive cells in the 0.8-, 1.0-, and 1.2-mg/kg groups were statistically
different from those in the operation, 0.2-, 0.4-, and 0.6-mg/kg groups (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the
differences in the number of BrdU-positive cells were significant between pairs of adjacent groups:
0.8-, 1.0-, and 1.2-mg/kg groups (P < 0.01, Figure 1 and Table 1).

DISCUSSION
It has been widely accepted that the adult central nervous system does not have the ability
to proliferate, differentiate, self-renew, and self-repair. However, further research on NSCs has
shown that after adults suffer ischemia and hypoxia injury, some physical and chemical stimulation
can promote nerve fiber cell proliferation and differentiation into neurons that can establish
functional synaptic connections, and effectively restore impaired function (Nakatomi et al., 2002;
Burns et al., 2009; Kernie and Parent, 2010). BrdU, a thymine analogue, can be incorporated into
new DNA during DNA synthesis (S phase), and BrdU antibody does not cross-react with thymine.
Thus, IHC can be used to observe BrdU incorporation and cell proliferation (Cooper-Kuhn and
Kuhn, 2002). BrdU-labeling is currently considered an indirect sign of NSCs. We used this principle
and method to label proliferative cortical cells and explore the proliferation of cortical cells under
normal and cerebral ischemia conditions; the results revealed that BrdU-positive cell proliferation
markedly increased after cerebral ischemia in rats, which indicates that ischemic injury does induce
cell proliferation in the germinal zone of the brain.
Takagi et al. (1999) established an adult rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia,
labeled mitotic cells with BrdU, and observed subgranular zone NSC proliferation; the results
revealed that the number of BrdU-positive cells was significantly increased 3, 7, 10, and 17 days
after reperfusion, especially on Day 7, which was consistent with the conclusions drawn by Yagita
et al. (2001). Zhang et al. (2001) reported that NSCs proliferated after ischemic injury in the cerebral
cortex ipsilateral to the injury and in the subventricular zone in MCAO adult rats, but only a few cells
differentiated into astrocytes and the rest underwent apoptosis.
There are a number of hypotheses regarding the source of NSCs in the cortex adjacent
to the infarction and the pathway that regulates NSC proliferation (Dizon et al., 2010; Toyoda et
al., 2012; Kang et al., 2013). The subventricular and subgranular zones have been confirmed
as the areas with largest numbers of NSCs in the adult brain. John et al. (1996) demonstrated
that persistent perfusion of the lateral ventricle with epidermal growth factor in adult chinchillas
increased the number of retrovirus-labeled cells by more than 17 times that of the control group
perfused with normal saline, and simultaneously promoted the migration of newborn cells from
the lateral ventricle wall to the membrane of adjacent regions (such as the cortex and the corpus
striatum, etc.). This migration is called the rostral migratory stream and it functions through neural
cell adhesion molecules. Other researchers have discovered that endogenous NSCs originally in
the “dormant” state are activated after cerebral ischemia; cells proliferate and differentiate on both
sides, ipsilateral and contralateral to ischemia, and mature cells surrounding the ischemic focus
can revert to NSCs that re-proliferate and differentiate into newborn cells and migrate into the
ischemic area where they eventually become thesocytes. This process is regulated by endogenous

and exogenous cytokines, and is directly influenced by various signals of the internal environment
(Zhang et al., 2001; Takasawa et al., 2002). In our study, the source of the BrdU-positive cells in
the infarctions requires further confirmation.
Our research confirmed the presence of abundant BrdU-positive cells in the cortex adjacent
to the infarctions. Through statistical analysis of positive cell numbers in the control, operation, and
MK-801 groups, we conclude that: the number of BrdU-positive cells in the 0.4- and 0.6-mg/kg MK801 groups significantly decreased compared with the operation group; and the inhibitory effect of
BrdU-positive cell proliferation at a MK-801 concentration of 0.8 mg/kg was markedly enhanced.
We observed that the number of BrdU-positive cells declined with increasing MK-801 concentration,
especially above 0.8 mg/kg. This demonstrates the evident inhibitory effect on BrdU-positive cell
proliferation of MK-801 at 0.4 mg/kg; increasing MK-801 concentration (above 0.8 mg/kg) positively
correlated with this inhibitory effect. The mechanism of the protective effect of NMDA receptor
antagonist MK-801 on neurons and its inhibitory effect on NSCs remain unclear. Most researchers
believe that MK-801 promotes NSC proliferation through inhibition of EAA toxicity, simultaneously
reduces calcium ion concentration, maintains the balance of intracellular and extracellular calcium,
and suppresses cell apoptosis (Laeng et al., 2004; Langton et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009). In
addition, the mitogen of NSCs is basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which, together with other
cytokines, mainly regulates the division of early precursor cells and promotes NSC migration
(Gleeson et al., 1999; Pearson et al., 2008). After cerebral ischemia, MK-801 regulates bFGF
expression in the brain and promotes directional migration of NSCs sensitive to bFGF. Moreover,
NMDA receptor antagonist can promote the upregulation of some cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6,
and TNF-α after cerebral ischemia, thereby influencing the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs
(Numakawa et al., 2010). However, the mechanisms and effects of MK-801 on neurons and NSCs
remain unclear and require further investigation. In conclusion, MK-801 concentration correlates
with the restoration of neural function after cerebral infarction; whether cortical NSCs adjacent to
the infarctions can further differentiate into functional neurons to repair damaged neural networks
requires further research.
