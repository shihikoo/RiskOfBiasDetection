Summary: Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) protects patients from focal cerebral ischemic injury, and
transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk (TCST) in a rat model can mimic SGB in humans. The
purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of TCST
on neuronal damage in the hippocampus in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in
an attempt to elucidate the neuroprotective effects of SGB. The modified method of Zea Longa was
used to establish the permanent MCAO model. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three
groups: sham-operated group, MCAO group, and TCST group. The animals in TCST group were sacrificed 48 h after TCST which was performed after the establishment of the MCAO model. Proteins were
extracted from the ipsilateral hippocampus and analyzed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). The levels of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) were measured as well. The results showed that 11 types of proteins were identified by 2DDIGE. The expressions of eight proteins were changed both in the sham-operated and TCST groups,
and the expressions of the other three proteins were changed in all three groups. Moreover, the expression of NSF was higher in the TCST group than in the MCAO group but lower in the MCAO group
than in sham-operated group. The ratio of NSF expression between the MCAO group and shamoperated group was –1.37 (P<0.05), whereas that between the TCST group and MCAO group was 1.35
(P<0.05). Our results imply that TCST increases the expression of NSF in the hippocampus of adult rats
with focal cerebral ischemia, which may contribute to the protection of the injured brain. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the therapeutic application of SGB to patients with permanent cerebral
ischemia.

Cerebral arterial thrombosis is characterized by
high incidence, high mortality, high paralysis rate, and
unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes[1]. Stellate ganglion
blockade (SGB) is frequently applied to treating cerebral
arterial thrombosis and it protects patients from cerebral
ischemic injury[2]. However, little is known regarding the
therapeutic mechanisms of SGB.
Proteomics emerged in the mid-1990s. It is the
large-scale of study of proteins expressed by the genome
of one cell or tissue, and it can be used to study the protein constitution and regulatory functions of proteins[3]. It
reveals protein function by inspecting the abundance and
characteristics of proteins, thereby identifying the nature
of vital phenomena[4]. Two-dimensional difference gel
electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) is one of the most reliable
and precise technologies for quantitative analysis of proteins[5, 6]. It can be used to compare the expressions of
different proteins under physiological and pathological
conditions and identify key proteins in the course of disease, which helps develop tailored therapeutic regimens.
Transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk
(TCST) in rats is an ideal animal model to mimic human

SGB[7]. The anatomy of cerebral vessels in rats is similar
to that in humans, and the middle cerebral artery is the
frequently affected artery subjected to cerebral arterial
thrombosis in humans. Therefore, rat models of focal
cerebral ischemia were established by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) and then they were treated by
TCST in this study. Usually, hippocampal cells are more
sensitive to hypoxia than the cells in other regions of the
brain[8]. In this study, hippocampal tissues were removed
for detection of the protein changes by 2D-DIGE and the
protective effect of TCST on neural damage in hippocampus was examined in an attempt to shed light on the
underlying mechanism of SGB in the treatment of cerebral arterial thrombosis.
1 MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experiments were performed at the Institute of
Neurological Diseases (Laboratory of Animal Biosafety,
Level 2), the First Hospital of Jilin University, China.
Experimental protocols were established according to the
ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration and were
approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the First
Hospital of Jilin University, China.
1.1 Animals and Grouping
Healthy male Wistar rats (12 rats, 3–4 months old,

802
weighing 280–300 g) were provided by Gaoxin Medical
Animal Experimental Research Center, China. Rats were
randomly divided into three groups (n=4 each): MCAO
group, TCST group, and sham-operated group. The rats
in the TCST group underwent both MACO and TCST.
Those in the sham-operated group were subjected to the
same operation procedures as those in the other two
groups except that the blood vessels and nerves were not
occluded or transected in the operation. The animals
were not allowed to eat or drink 12 h prior to the operation.
1.2 Reagents and Instruments
The reagents and instruments included CyDye fluorescence labeling reagents Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5, dimethylformamide (DMF), 24-cm solid-phase pH gradient, dry
paste pH 3–10 NL, α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid
(CCA), clean-up kit, 2D Quant quantifying kit, Ultrospec
3300 Pro spectrophotometer, Ettan IPGphor isoelectric
focusing apparatus, Ettan DALT six electrophoresis system, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS), Ettan digester, Ettan spotter, and Ettan picker, all of which were
purchased from GE Healthcare-Biosciences Company,
Sweden. The Typhoon 9400 fluorescence scanning imaging and DeCyder difference analysis software were
purchased from GE Healthcare-Biosciences Company
(USA). The electro-thermal thermostatic water bath
(DK-8D), bipolar electrocoagulator, operation microscope, and brain slicing mold were obtained from
Shanghai Pumai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (China), and
the photo microscope was from Olympus (Japan).
1.3 Establishment of Rat Models of MCAO and
TCST
A rat model of focal cerebral ischemia was constructed according to the improved Zea Longa method as
described previously[9] (i.e. via embolization of the
common carotid artery). A fish-thread, 0.26 mm in diameter, was inserted into the right common carotid artery
through a mini-pore, which was 3 mm away from the bifurcation, and then the thread went through the bifurcation and was inserted into the internal carotid artery until
it was advanced approximately 19 mm. Following
MCAO, an embolus was inserted into the intracalvarium,

J Huazhong Univ Sci Technol［Med Sci］ 34(6):2014

and the right cervical sympathetic trunk was transected
approximately 3 mm below the superior cervical ganglion, which was located on the dorsal surface of the
right common carotid artery bifurcation. After the rats
woke up, if they presented with typical Horner’s syndrome such as ptosis, narrowing eye fission, and miosis,
the transection of the cervical sympathetic nerve was
considered to be successful. Neurological scores were
assessed based on the standards of Zea Longa[9]: score 0,
the rats had no symptoms of neurological deficit; score 1,
the rats failed to extend the left forepaw fully; score 2,
the rats circled to the left; score 3, the rats fell to the left;
score 4, the rats did not walk spontaneously and had a
depressed level of consciousness. A successful model
was defined as the score being greater than 1.
1.4 Preparation and Quantitation of Proteins in the
Hippocampal Tissues
The behaviors of the rats were observed 48 h postoperation. After the rat models were confirmed to be
successful, the infarction area in the ipsilateral hippocampi was dissected from the brains in the rats from the
different groups, and then the tissues were homogenized
and weighed. Homogenization buffer (30 mmol/L Tris, 2
mol/L thiourea, 7 mol/L urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% protease
inhibitor, and 1% nuclease) 10 times as much as the volume of the tissues was added into a homogenizer, and
the tissues were homogenized in an ice-water bath. The
tissue was allowed to digest for 30 min at room temperature, and then it was centrifuged for 30 min at 19 500
r/min, 15°C. The supernatant was then collected, the debris was removed from the sample with a clean-up kit,
and the protein was quantified with a 2D Quant quantifying kit.
1.5 Two-dimensional Electrophoresis
The pH of each sample was adjusted from 8.5 to
9.0. Samples were prepared with 4.17 μg each of S1–4,
M1–4, and T1–4 (50 μg total) and 25 μg of internal standard. Groups were then divided as listed in table 1. The
samples were kept in an ice bath protected from light for
30 min, lysine solution (10 mmol/L, 1 μL) was added to
the samples, and the reaction proceeded for 10 min in the
dark before it was finally terminated.

Three samples were fluorescently labeled and
loaded on six gels as described in table 1. The total volume of the solution reached up to 450 μL after the hydration liquid was added. Hydration and isoelectrofocusing
were performed. The IPG gels were balanced in a balanced solution (50 mmol/L Tris, 6 mol/L urea, 30%
glycerol, and 2% SDS) twice (4% iodoacetamide was
added the second time.). Then, the samples were transferred to the upper edge of 12.5% SDS-PAGE, envel-

oped with agarose, electrophoresed under 40 mA permanent current for 30 min in an EttanDALTsix electrophoresis system, followed by changing the electrophoresis
voltage to permanent power (12 W), and running for approximately 17 h until bromophenol blue reached the
bottom of the gels.
1.6 Scanning and Analysis of the Gel Pictures
The gels stained with Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 were
scanned with a Typhoon 9400 laser scanner (GE Health-

803

J Huazhong Univ Sci Technol［Med Sci］ 34(6):2014

care-Biosciences Company, USA). The images of gels
labeled with Cy3, Cy5, and Cy2 were taken under excitation at wavelengths of 532, 633, and 488 nm, respectively. A total of 18 two-dimensional electrophoresis pictures were taken from the six gels.
Scanned images were analyzed by DeCyder difference analysis software (GE Healthcare-Biosciences
Company, USA), which was used to search for differentially expressed proteins. Subsequently, analysis of protein expression and matching proteins by DeCyder-BP
software was performed. Data were analyzed by the ttest with DeCyder-BVA software. Statistical significance
was indicated by P<0.05 if the protein content was increased or decreased by more than 20%.
1.7 Preparation of Gel Electrophoresis and Identification of Different Protein Points
Protein samples were prepared as described above.
Proteins were quantified using the method as mentioned
above. Proteins (800 μg) were extracted from the shamoperated, MCAO, and TCST groups, respectively, and
two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed as detailed above. The molecular weight marker of protein
was applied near the acidic side of the gels. Once electrophoresis was finished, the prepared gels were fixed in
20% trichloroacetic acid overnight and then shaken
lightly in a swing bed (the gels were infiltrated by heated
Coomassie brilliant blue staining solution). Decolorization was repeatedly performed with 10% glacial acetic
acid until the background became clear.
A match between the prepared gel and analyzed gel
was made. Matching proteins were cut from the prepared
gel with the Ettan picker. The cut-out gel piece was then
digested with trypsin in the Ettan digester, and peptide
fragments were extracted. A polypeptide sample (0.3 μL)
taken with the Ettan spotter was mixed with 0.3 μL of
CCA and added with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid solution, and the solution was then
applied to the samples.
1.8 Statistical Analysis
The results were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) using MALDI-TOF MS. AngⅢ and

hACTH (19-39), with m/z values of 897.531 and
2465.199, respectively, were used as outside calibrations.
The pancreatin digest peak, with m/z values of 842.508,
1045.564, 2211.108, and 2225.119, respectively, served
as an internal calibration. PMF results were inputted into
the NCBI database (rats were selected as the experimental animal). The basal criteria of identification were as
follows: fraction of coverage (the percentage of matched
polypeptides/total protein sequences) was more than
15%, and the expected value (probability of error identification) was less than 0.01. Further verification of peptide mass inputs was made with the Swiss-Prot database
(us.expasy.org/sprot).
2 RESULTS
2.1 Expression of Different Proteins in the Hippocampus Analyzed by 2D-DIGE
The mean value of protein segregation was found to
be 1356±145 from six gels analyzed by DeCyder-BVA
software, and the matched rate of proteins was approximately 68%. The t-test was adopted for statistical analysis of the protein expressions. Differentially expressed
proteins were defined as proteins that were upregulated
or downregulated by more than 20% (P< 0.05). Eightytwo differentially expressed proteins were found when
the prepared gel and analyzed gel were compared. Nine
differentially expressed proteins were found between the
MCAO and sham-operated groups (five proteins were
upregulated and four proteins downregulated.). The
DIGE-analyzed gel results are shown in fig. 1. In addition, three differentially expressed proteins were found
when proteins were compared between the TCST and
MCAO groups (one protein was upregulated and two
proteins downregulated.) (fig. 2). The point “a” in figs. 1
and 2 represents the same protein point. The content of
this point was decreased in the MCAO group when compared with that in the sham-operated group, and it was
increased in the TCST group when compared with that in
the MCAO group.

the samples were automatically analyzed by PMF using
MALDI-TOF MS. Protein identifications were made by

searching the NCBI database and analyzed by ProFound
software. The results showed that eleven protein points
were identified (table 2). The results of comparisons
among the groups regarding protein abundance are

Proteins from point 1 to point 8 corresponded to
proteins differently expressed between the MCAO and
sham-operated groups and are also shown in fig. 1. The
protein at point 1 indicates spectrin alpha chain; point 3
is heat shock protein 70; point 4 is succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A flavoprotein; point 6 is uracil
DNA glycosylase; and point 7 is glial fibrillary acidic
protein delta. The five proteins were upregulated in the
MCAO group when compared with the sham-operated
group. In contrast, three proteins were found to be downregulated in the MCAO group when compared with the
sham-operated group. They were dynamin-like protein
DLP1 isoform DLP1-37, which was found at point 2,
serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit
alpha isoform at point 5, and serine/threonine-protein
phosphatase PP1-beta catalytic subunit at point 8.
The point b to point c proteins represented the different proteins between the MCAO and TCST groups,
and they are shown in fig. 1. Crystallin was identified at
point b, and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha
subcomplex subunit 10 at point c. They were both
upregulated in the TCST group when compared with the
MCAO group.
The protein found at point a was one of the most
significant proteins of all the 11 proteins, and it was
identified to be NSF. The expression of NSF was found
to be lower in the MCAO group than in the shamoperated group; however, it was higher in the TCST
group than in the MCAO group. The ratio between the
MCAO group and sham-operated group was –1.37
(P<0.05), whereas it was 1.35 between the TCST group
and MCAO group (P<0.05).
3 DISCUSSION
Cerebral infarction frequently occurs in the brain
region supplied by the middle cerebral artery. The rat
model of MCAO is a typical animal model of focal cerebral ischemia. It has been shown that SGB can improve
blood circulation in the brain by local injection of anesthetic to the loose connective cervical tissue in the stellate ganglion (SG), and SGB has protective effects by
increasing the circulation of the cerebral vessels, maintaining the body homeostasis, improving the oxygen

equilibrium, and regulating the release of cytokines in
the central nervous system[10, 11]. TCST in the rat is an
ideal animal model to mimic SGB in humans. Studies
have shown that TCST in rats subjected to MCAO has
therapeutic effects, as evidenced by increased plasma
levels of calcitonin-gene-related peptide[12], which could
reduce cerebral ischemic injury[13], protect hypoxic neurons[14], and consequently reduce mortality[15]. These
findings indicate that TCST prevents neuronal damage
from focal cerebral ischemia.
In a rat model of forebrain ischemia, Danielisová et
al revealed that the hippocampal CA1 area and dorsolateral part of the corpus striatum were vulnerable to
ischemia compared to the cerebral cortex by investigating iron deposition[16]. And the striatum was the most severely affected region and presented as the ischemic core
following MCAO, while the penumbral region was
mostly found in the cortical area and hippocampus[17, 18].
Considering the important role of the hippocampus in
memory and learning, examining the focal cerebral
ischemia-induced hippocampal dysfunction may lead to
further understanding of the mechanisms underlying
cognitive damage and contribute to seeking potential
treatment for ischemia. Moreover, NSF, the main target
protein we examined in this study, was expressed prominently in the hippocampus[19]. Thus, we chose the hippocampus rather than the striatum and cortex for protein
analysis.
In the present study, we first analyzed differential
protein expressions in ischemic brains from rats treated
with or without TCST by using DIGE and MS. Of all the
11 differentially expressed proteins identified, we found
that 10 proteins were expressed differently between either the MCAO/sham-operated groups or the MCAO/
TCST groups. However, the expression of NSF was exceptional, which was lower in the MCAO group than in
the sham-operated group but was higher in the TCST
group than in the MCAO group. The findings indicated
that only NSF could precisely reflect the effect of TCST
on MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia. Therefore,
we chose it as the target protein in the present study.
NSF is a type of ATP enzyme associated with diverse cellular functions, such as intracellular membrane
fusion, while it also directly interacts with other proteins,

806
such as the glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GLuR2) of αamino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid
(AMPA) receptor, GABA(A) receptor, serotonin transporter, etc.; and it is thought to affect the membrane trafficking or recycling of these proteins, as well as their
corresponding functions in the central nervous system[20, 21].
Injured neurons need considerable membrane proteins for self-repair. NSF is an essential component of
the protein machinery responsible for various membrane
fusion events, including transportation of inter-cisternal
Golgi protein and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles[22].
These functions are mediated by binding NSF through
soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) to SNARE
complexes that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to
disassemble them, thus facilitating SNARE recycling[20].
Intracellular disequilibrium induced by ischemia (such as
ATP absence, calcium overload, acidosis, and increase of
active oxygen, etc.) can change the configuration of NSF
and lead to the inactivation of NSF[23]. Excessive nitric
oxide after cerebral ischemia degrades NSF activity by
nitrosylation of an NSF cysteine residue[20], which is also
one of these mechanisms of NSF inactivation. Meanwhile, NSF is relocated in some cell components that
cannot be dissolved by Triton X-100, such as intracellular vesicles in CA1 neurons after transient cerebral
ischemia. The changes of NSF are accompanied with the
accumulation of a large number of intracellular vesicles
in CA1 pyramidal neurons selectively vulnerable to
ischemic stroke[23]. NSF relocation may lead to a loss of
vesicle fusion function, which is essential for repairing
synapse injury, consequently leading to synapse dysfunction and neuronal death after transient cerebral ischemia.
Thus, increased NSF expression after TCST indicated
improvement of cell repair in the hippocampus.
NSF binds to AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 and
functions to maintain receptors at the synapse, and
AMPAR trafficking is fundamental to the process of
synaptic plasticity, which contributes to learning and
memory[24]. However, overload of Ca2+ caused by
ischemic attack may inhibit NSF-GluR2 interaction,
leading to damage of learning ability and memory. On
the other hand, the CA1-CA3 neuronal injury pattern is
mediated by Ca2+/Zn2+ entry into these neurons through
AMPA receptor channels, of which, the GluR2 subunits
are crucial for determining Ca2+/Zn2+ permeability[25, 26].
It has been well established that the NSF-GluR2 interaction mediates the surface expression of GluR2containing AMPA receptors and that any disruption of
the interaction leads to the functional elimination of
AMPA receptors at synapses[27]. It seems that increased
NSF in CA1 neurons after TCST would upregulate NSFGluR2 interactions, which promotes AMPA expression
and leads to postischemic neurotocixity. Given the major
function of NSF in the assembly/disassembly cycle of
the SNARE proteins, a function essential for cell survival, and interactions of NSF with non-SNARE proteins,
it is speculated that increased NSF after TCST has a protective effect on injured brain tissues.
In summary, we demonstrated the neuroprotective
effects of TCST were associated with the increase in the
NSF expression in the hippocampus of rats with permanent MCAO. Our study provides novel experimental data
for the clinical application of SGB for the treatment of

ischemic stroke as well as a new pharmaceutical target
for stroke.
