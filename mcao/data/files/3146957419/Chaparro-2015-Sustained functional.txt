Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), efﬁcacious in preclinical models of acute central nervous system injury, is burdened by
administration of full-length proteins. A multiinstitutional consortium investigated the efﬁcacy of BB3, a small molecule with
HGF-like activity that crosses the blood–brain barrier in rodent focal ischemic stroke using Stroke Therapy Academic Industry
Roundtable (STAIR) and Good Laboratory Practice guidelines. In rats, BB3, begun 6 hours after temporary middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO) reperfusion, or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) onset, and continued for 14 days
consistently improved long-term neurologic function independent of sex, age, or laboratory. BB3 had little effect on cerebral infarct
size and no effect on blood pressure. BB3 increased HGF receptor c-Met phosphorylation and synaptophysin expression in
penumbral tissue consistent with a neurorestorative mechanism from HGF-like activity. In mouse tMCAO, BB3 starting 10 minutes
after reperfusion and continued for 14 days improved neurologic function that persisted for 8 weeks in some, but not all measures.
Study in animals with comorbidities and those exposed to common stroke drugs are the next steps to complete preclinical
assessment. These data, generated in independent, masked, and rigorously controlled settings, are the ﬁrst to suggest that the
HGF pathway can potentially be harnessed by BB3 for neurologic beneﬁt after ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a cytokine that participates in
the regulation of angiogenesis, neurogenesis, organogenesis, and
tissue reconstruction.1 A broad range of cell types including ﬁbroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells produce or respond to HGF
via its cognate receptor c-Met.2 Hepatocyte growth factor can act
as a morphogen inducing transition of epithelial cells into a
mesenchymal morphology and stimulates epithelial branching
and tubulogenesis. These responses reﬂect HGF’s role in organogenesis and tissue healing.3,4 Hepatocyte growth factor is also
cytoprotective as a consequence of its antiapoptotic and antiﬁbrotic activity.5–7 Preclinical models investigating HGF protein or
gene therapy have demonstrated positive results in ischemia/
reperfusion injury to the liver, heart, lung, and kidney.8–11
Hepatocyte growth factor and c-MET are also present in both
the developing and adult mammalian brain.12,13 Activation of the
HGF/c-Met pathway may offer value to the acutely injured brain as
a neurorestorative therapeutic. Hepatocyte growth factor has been
repeatedly associated with increased neurogenesis, synaptogenesis,
and angiogenesis and decreased lesion size in experimental brain
ischemia.14–17

BB3 is a small molecule, discovered by phage display with molecular modeling, which emulates HGF properties in vitro. In preclinical
models of renal and myocardial ischemic injury, therapeutic effects
of BB3 were observed with drug administration starting 24 hours
after insult (data not shown); an observation consistent with
upregulation of the c-Met receptor in at-risk tissue.18
BB3 is currently under clinical investigation as a therapeutic for
delayed graft function after kidney transplantation (NCT01286727).
We hypothesized that BB3 will exert neurorestorative effects in the
context of experimental focal ischemic stroke. A multiinstitutional
consortium was established to systematically deﬁne BB3 efﬁcacy in
preclinical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models
respecting the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) and Good Laboratory Practice guidelines.19,20

(Uniondale, NY, USA) approved Experiments 3 and 10. The Massachusetts
General Hospital Subcommittee on Research and Animal Care (Boston, MA,
USA) approved Experiment 8. Experiments were performed according to
IACUC guidelines, the National Institutes of Health guide for care and use
of laboratory animals, and ARRIVE guidelines (www. nc3rs.org.uk/arriveguidelines).

BB3
Angion Biomedica Corporation provided BB3. BB3 was prepared by
sonication in a vehicle consisting of ﬁve parts polyethylene glycol 300, one
part Tween and four parts phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, V/V). Final
concentration was 6 mg/mL.

Experimental Designs
Experimental designs will ﬁrst be outlined with detailed methodology to
follow.

Experiment 1: Rat BB3 Blood–Brain Barrier Penetration
To assess the distribution of BB3 in the central nervous system, seven
healthy male 8-week-old Long Evans rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
were given a single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg 14C-BB3. At prespeciﬁed
time points, the rats were exsanguinated and 14C-BB3 concentrations were
measured in plasma, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, medulla, olfactory lobe,
and spinal cord white and gray matter (one rat per time point).

Experiment 2: Physiologic Effects of a Single BB3 Dose After Rat
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
This experiment was performed to determine whether BB3 causes changes
in physiologic values known to alter ischemic outcome, which might
warrant control in subsequent experiments. Male rats (10 to 12 weeks of
age) were subjected to either transient (temporary MCAO, tMCAO) or
permanent (pMCAO) middle cerebral artery occlusion and placed in a
harness system allowing continuous pericranial temperature and arterial
blood pressure monitoring. Rats were randomly assigned to treatment
with 0, 2, 6, or 12 mg/kg intraperitoneal BB3 (n = 4 to 6 per group) at
90 minutes after MCAO onset. For tMCAO, pericranial temperature was
continuously controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C during the 90 minutes ischemic
interval and was then allowed to freely ﬂux with continuous monitoring for
20 hours after treatment onset. Arterial blood pressure, blood gases/pH/
glucose and hematocrit were serially recorded over 20 hours. For pMCAO,
pericranial temperature was controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C for 60 minutes after
occlusion and then allowed to freely ﬂux with physiologic monitoring as
described for tMCAO for 20 hours. These rats were not subjected to
outcome analysis.

Experiment 3: BB3 Dose-Response Analysis in the Rat (Temporary
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion)
Male Wistar rats (10 to 12 weeks) were subjected to 90 minutes tMCAO.
Pericranial temperature was controlled (37.5 ± 0.2 °C) during tMCAO. Dose
range selection was based on a large body of data demonstrating 2 mg/kg
BB3 to be highly efﬁcacious in peripheral tissue models of ischemic injury
(data not shown) and the results of Experiment 2. Rats were randomly
assigned to receive intraperitoneal vehicle (n = 19), 2 mg/kg BB3 (n = 19), or
6 mg/kg BB3 (n = 21). Treatment onset was 90 minutes after tMCAO
reperfusion. Rats survived 14 days with daily intraperitoneal vehicle or BB3
treatment. Neurologic scores and cerebral infarct volume were then
measured.

Experiment 4: BB3 Effects on Rat Temporary Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion Outcome (Delayed Treatment Onset)
Male Wistar rats (10 to 12 weeks) were subjected to 90 minutes tMCAO.
Pericranial temperature was controlled (37.5 ± 0.2 °C) during tMCAO and
for 20 hours after reperfusion. Six hours after reperfusion onset, rats were
randomly assigned to receive vehicle or BB3 (n = 20/group) for 14 days. On
the basis of Experiment 3, we selected a daily intraperitoneal BB3 dose of
6 mg/kg. Rats were housed under standard vivarium conditions for an
additional 27 days and then subjected to neurologic evaluation and infarct
size measurement.

Experiment 5: Effects of BB3 on Rat Permanent Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion Outcome (Delayed Treatment Onset)
This experiment was identical to Experiment 4 with the exception that the
MCA was permanently occluded by cautery and bisection in 10 to 12 week
old male Wistar rats. Pericranial temperature was controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C
for 20 hours after MCAO onset. Rats were randomly assigned to BB3 (6 mg/
kg per day intraperitoneal) beginning 6 hours after pMCAO onset (n = 21),
or an equivalent volume of vehicle (n = 21) continued for 14 days.
Neurological function and infarct size were measured 28 days after MCAO.

Experiment 6: Sex-Speciﬁc Effects of BB3 on Rat Temporary Middle
Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome (Delayed Treatment Onset)
Female and male rats (10 to 12 weeks) were investigated contemporaneously, subjected to 90 minutes tMCAO, and randomly assigned to
receive daily BB3 (6 mg/kg intraperitoneal) or vehicle beginning 6 hours
after reperfusion onset for 14 days (n = 20/group/sex). Pericranial temperature was controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C during ischemia and for 20 hours
after reperfusion. Neurological function and infarct size were measured
28 days after MCAO. Females were subjected to tMCAO in the estrus
stage.21

Experiment 7: BB3 Effects on Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion Outcome Outcome in Aged Rats (Delayed Treatment
Onset)
Male Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Biosciences, Inc., Germantown, NY, USA,
National Institute on Aging, 22 months of age) were ﬁrst subjected to the
standardized neurologic examination to determine baseline functional
status. To provide the most rigorous test possible, we subjected these rats
to the pMCAO protocol. To minimize surgical invasiveness and allow
repeated blood pressure monitoring during recovery, a tail artery catheter
was not used. Instead, tail artery mean arterial pressure (MAP) was
measured noninvasively 15 minutes before MCAO onset, 1 hour after
MCAO onset, and repeatedly during the 28-day recovery.
Aged rats were randomly assigned to receive daily BB3 (6 mg/kg
intraperitoneal n = 21) or vehicle (n = 19) beginning 6 hours after pMCAO
onset for 14 days. Pericranial temperature was controlled (37.5 ± 0.3 °C) for
the ﬁrst 20 hours after MCAO. Neurologic function and infarct size were
measured 28 days after MCAO.

Experiment 8: BB3 Effect on Mouse Temporary Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion Outcome (Acute and Delayed Treatment Onset)
Mice were subjected to 60 minutes tMCAO and then randomly assigned
to intraperitoneal BB3 (6 mg/kg, n = 20) or vehicle (n = 20) beginning,
for each group, either 10 minutes (n = 10) or 6 hours (n = 10) after
reperfusion onset, and subsequently dosed daily for 14 days. Rectal
temperature was controlled (37.0 °C) during ischemia. Neurologic function
was examined over 8 weeks after tMCAO. Cerebral lesion volume was then
measured.

Experiment 9: BB3 Effects on Rat Post-Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion Outcome Brain Water Content
Male Wistar rats (10 to 12 weeks) were subjected to tMCAO. Pericranial
temperature was controlled (37.5 ± 0.2 °C) during ischemia and for 20 hours
after reperfusion. Six hours after reperfusion, rats were randomly assigned
to vehicle or BB3 treatment groups (n = 10 per group). Twenty-four hours
after MCAO, the rats were re-anesthetized with isoﬂurane, decapitated, and
brain water content was measured using the wet weight–dry weight
method described previously.22 To provide normal reference values, ﬁve
naive rats, without ischemic insult, were anesthetized and brain water
content was measured.

Experiment 10: Immunohistochemical Effects of BB3 On c-Met
Phosphorylation and Synaptophysin Expression After Rat
Temporary Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome.
Male Wistar rats (10 to 12 weeks) were subjected to tMCAO with pericranial
temperature servo-controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C during ischemia. Separate
animals were used for each analytic procedure. For c-Met phosphorylation,
rats (n = 5/group) were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal BB3
(6 mg/kg) or vehicle at 2 and 23 hours after reperfusion. One hour after the
second dose, brains were harvested and frozen (−80 °C). For synaptophysin

expression, rats were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal vehicle
(n = 6) or BB3 (6 mg/kg daily) for 14 (n = 4) or 28 (n = 4) days. All the rats
were allowed to survive 28 days, after which synaptophysin was measured.

Rat Temporary Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome
Procedure
Wistar rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were housed in a
temperature-controlled environment with an artiﬁcial light/dark cycle
(12 hours). They were fasted from food but allowed free access to water for
12 hours before ischemia. Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoﬂurane in
30% O2, balance N2. The trachea was intubated and the lungs were mechanically ventilated. The inspired isoﬂurane concentration was decreased to
1.5% to 2%, and animals were prepared for MCAO using techniques
previously described.23
The surgery was performed with aseptic technique. The tail artery was
cannulated to monitor MAP and sample blood. A calibrated ﬂexible
thermistor was percutaneously implanted beneath the right temporalis
adjacent to the skull and secured. Pericranial temperature (37.5 °C ± 0.2 °C)
was continuously controlled by surface heating/cooling. The scalp was
incised and the parietal bone thinned 2 mm posterior and 6 mm lateral to
bregma. A guide was glued to the skull to position a laser Doppler ﬂow
(LDF) probe.
A skin incision was made and the right common carotid identiﬁed. The
external carotid artery was isolated, ligated, and divided. The internal
carotid was dissected distally until the origin of the pterygopalatine artery
was visualized. After surgical preparation, a 20-minute interval was allowed
for physiologic stabilization. Heparin (50 IU) was given intravenously to
prevent arterial thrombosis.
To achieve MCAO, a 0.25-mm-diameter nylon ﬁlament coated with
silicon (0.38 mm diameter) was inserted into the external carotid artery
stump and advanced 19 mm to 20 mm from the carotid artery bifurcation
until resistance was felt. Animals failing to meet a 460% LDF reduction
from baseline or having hemorrhage were a priori excluded. After ﬁlament
insertion, a silicon harness was positioned on the torso. The thermistor lead
was passed through a ﬂexible coil attached to both the harness and a
swivel commutator. Isoﬂurane was discontinued to minimize anesthetic
exposure.24
The rats were transferred to an acrylic chamber allowing continuous
control of pericranial temperature at 37.5 °C ± 0.2 °C. The trachea was
extubated. At 85 minutes after MCAO onset, isoﬂurane was reintroduced,
the ﬁlament and arterial catheter were removed, and wounds were
inﬁltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine and closed with suture. Isoﬂurane was
discontinued. The rat was returned to the acrylic chamber containing 30%
O2/balance N2 for 20 hours allowing pericranial thermoregulation to
continue with free access to food and water. The thermistor and harness
were removed and rats returned to their cages.
Arterial CO2 and O2 partial pressures and pH, glucose, hematocrit were
measured 15 minutes before and 45 minutes after MCAO onset and
15 minutes after reperfusion. MAP was continuously monitored until
15 minutes after reperfusion.

Rat Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome
Procedure
Procedures were similar to those used for tMCAO with the following
exceptions. A right subtemporal craniectomy was performed and the dura
opened. The MCA was separated from the meninges, cauterized, and
bisected just proximal to the lenticulostriate artery. Bupivacaine (0.25%)
was instilled and the wound closed with suture. Rats were awakened and
pericranial temperature was thermoregulated for 20 hours at 37.5 °C ± 0.2 °C.
Rats were then returned to their cages.

Rat Neurologic Scoring System
We used a system that evaluates general status (spontaneous activity,
body symmetry, gait), simple motor deﬁcit (forelimb asymmetry, circling,
hind limb placement), complex motor deﬁcit (vertical screen climbing,
beam walking), and sensory deﬁcit (hind limb, trunk, vibrissae, and face
touch).25–27 The score given to each animal at the completion of testing
was the sum of the four individual scores with 0 being the minimum (best)
score and 48 the maximum possible (worst) score.
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 1044 – 1053

Measurement of Rat Cerebral Infarct Volume
Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane and decapitated. The brains
were removed, frozen at − 40 °C in 2-methylbutane, and stored at − 80 °C.
Serial quadruplicate 20-μm thick coronal sections were taken at 800-μm
intervals over the rostral–caudal extent of the infarct. The sections were
dried and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. An image analyzer digitized
a section from each 800-μm interval. Each image was stored as a
1,280 × 960 calibrated pixel matrix and displayed on a video monitor. The
noninfarcted ipsilateral cerebral cortex, noninfarcted ipsilateral subcortex,
contralateral cerebral cortex, and contralateral subcortex were cursor
outlined. The area within each region (mm2) was determined by automated pixel counting. Ipsilateral noninfarcted cortex and subcortex areas
were subtracted from the corresponding contralateral regions of interest
values to estimate the area of ischemic tissue damage. Infarct volumes
(mm3) were computed as running sums of subtracted infarct areas
multiplied by the known interval (e.g., 800 μm) between sections over the
rostral–caudal extent of the infarct calculated as an orthogonal projection.28 Cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were added to obtain total
infarct volume.

Mouse Temporary Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome and
Outcome Analysis
Spontaneously breathing male mice (C57/BL6, 8 to 9 weeks, Charles River
Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) were anesthetized with
1.5% isoﬂurane in 70% N2O/30% O2. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37 °C using a servo-controlled heating pad. Temporary middle cerebral
artery occlusion was induced in the right hemisphere by inserting a 7-0
suture through the external carotid artery. Mice were removed from
anesthesia 5 minutes after occlusion and re-anesthetized for suture
removal 60 minutes after insertion. Laser Doppler ﬂow was monitored over
the MCA area. Failure of LDF to decrease 480% of baseline or hemorrhage
during surgery were a priori exclusion criteria. After tMCAO, mice were
placed in a temperature-controlled environment with easy access to food
and water, and administered daily subcutaneous saline supplements
(1 mL/day) and ampicillin (1 mg/day) for up to 7 days. Four sensorimotor
tests were performed pre-ischemia, and 1, 3, 6, and 8 weeks after tMCAO.
The adhesive-removal test measured the time to remove tape from the
contralateral forepaw (up to 300 seconds);29 grid-walk measured forepaw
placement accuracy on a 20 × 30 cm grid plate (% foot-faults/total steps);30
corner test measured the direction of rear-and-turn movement when the
animal faced a wedge with a 30° corner (% ipsilateral/total turns);31
cylinder test measured the % forepaw use ((ipsilateral − contralateral)/total)
in rearing when placed in a vertical transparent cylinder.32
At 8 weeks, brains were harvested as described for the rat experiments
with sections collected every 500 μm and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Using image analysis, hemisphere and ventricle areas were
measured and integrated along the anteroposterior axis. Hemispheric
volume was calculated in mm3 by subtracting the ventricle volume from
each hemisphere.

Immunohistochemistry
To measure c-Met phosphorylation, sections (20 μm) were warmed to
room temperature for 30 minutes. The tissue was immersed in − 20 °C
100% methanol for 40 minutes, repeated, and then in − 20 °C acetone for
30 minutes. Samples were dried for 20 minutes. For antigen retrieval,
samples were washed twice with PBS for 3 minutes at room temperature,
heated to 100 °C in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 minutes, cooled to
room temperature, PBS washed as above, and blocked in 2% bovine serum
albumin in PBS with 2 mM EDTA for 45 minutes. Rabbit anti-phospho-cMet (phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235)(D26) XP, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), diluted 1/50 in fresh blocking buffer, was added and
incubated overnight at 4 °C. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody was diluted 1/100 in blocking buffer and incubated on
samples for 2 hours at room temperature. Samples were washed twice in
PBS for 5 minutes and incubated with alkaline phosphate substrate (Vector
Blue, #SK-5300, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) at room temperature,
then washed with tap water for 1 minute, rinsed with deionized water, and
air dried at room temperature before mounting. Images were captured and
quantiﬁed using Bioquant Nova Prime V6.90.10 (Nashville, TN, USA).
To measure synaptophysin serial sections taken from the dorsal cortex
peri-infarct region at bregma ± 1 mm were washed twice with PBS for
3 minutes at room temperature followed by heating to 100 °C in 10 mM TE

cooled to room temperature, washed twice with Tris-buffered saline for
3 minutes with shaking and blocked with 2% normal goat serum in Trisbuffered saline (150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) with 2 mM
EDTA (blocking buffer) for 60 minutes. Primary monoclonal antibody to
synaptophysin (EMD Millipore, Damstadt, Germany) was diluted 1/100 in
fresh blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescein
isothiocyanate conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, Santa
Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA; 1/100 dilution) was added and
samples incubated in blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature,
washed twice for 10 minutes with shaking in Tris-buffered saline, mounted,
and kept at 4 °C protected from light. Images were captured on Leica
Confocal SPS-2500 System and quantiﬁed using Leica Metamorph software
(Nashville, TN, USA).

Statistical Analysis
A computerized randomizer (http://randomizer.org),33 made group assignments for all experiments except Experiment 8 for which randomization
was conducted by blindly drawing assignments from a box.
All experiments were conducted in a fully masked fashion. Surgeons
were unaware of group assignment. A separate individual conducted
treatment injections. Group allocation was concealed from all individuals
conducting outcome analysis. In most cases, individuals who conducted
outcome analysis were different from those who performed surgery or
treatment. When the same individuals who performed another task
conducted outcome analysis, concealment was achieved by recoding the
histologic slides.
For two-group outcome rat experiments, a power analysis was calculated using data for rat MCAO and 6 hours delayed treatment onset
reported previously for Mn porphyrins.27 Assuming β = 0.80 and s.d. of
61 mm3 for total infarct volume in the vehicle group, 16 rats/group was
calculated to be the minimum to detect infarct volume reduction of 37%
by BB3.
Data from Experiment 1 were analyzed qualitatively. Rat infarct volumes,
neurologic scores, and brain water content were examined for normality of
distribution and homogeneity of variance and then compared using oneway analysis of variance (post hoc Tukey honest signiﬁcant difference) or
the unpaired Student’s t-test, as appropriate. Simple linear regression
tested an association between neurologic score (dependent variable) and
total cerebral infarct volume (independent variable). To conserve statistical
power, male and female rats were analyzed independently in Experiment
6. The Fisher Exact test was used to compare between group mortality
rates in Experiment 7. In Experiment 8, data were analyzed by two-way
repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference test (Prism v6, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis in the remaining experiments was performed using JMP
Pro 9.0.0, SAS, Cary, NC, USA. Statistical signiﬁcance was assumed when
Po0.05. Values are presented as mean ± s.d.

RESULTS
Experiment 1: BB3 Crosses the Blood–Brain Barrier
14
C-BB3-derived radioactivity was detected in all measured brain
and spinal cord regions after a single intravenous injection. Peak
concentrations were present at 0.25 hours after injection, which
declined over time. Relative to radioactivity levels found in the
organs of excretion and nongastrointestinal tract tissues, CNS

tissue concentrations were lower, however, these data indicate
that BB3 rapidly distributes into the brain (Table 1).
Experiment 2: Physiologic Effects of a Single BB3 Dose After Rat
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome
Physiologic values were examined in both tMCAO and pMCAO
models as a function of BB3 dose. There was no effect of BB3 dose
on MAP, hematocrit, PaCO2, PaO2, or arterial blood pH or glucose
(data not shown). However, for both tMCAO and pMCAO, postischemic pericranial hypothermia was evident before the start
of treatment. BB3 dose-dependently enhanced hypothermia
(Figure 1). Most noteworthy was the reduction of temperature
to 33 °C with 12 mg/kg, which caused us to discontinue the study
of this dose. Given the effects of anesthesia and BB3, pericranial
temperature was controlled (37.5 °C) during MCAO for an
additional 20 hours in most subsequent experiments. Because
BB3 had no effect on MAP, MAP was not monitored during the
treatment phase in subsequent experiments, except for in
Experiment 7 (aged rats).
Experiment 3: BB3 Dose-Response Analysis In Rat (Temporary
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome)
There was a main effect for treatment group on neurologic scores
14 days after MCAO (F = 6.47, P = 0.003). Post hoc analysis showed
an effect for 6 mg/kg BB3 (12 ± 2, P = 0.002), but not 2 mg/kg BB3
(14 ± 3, P = 0.59) versus vehicle (14 ± 2). A main effect could not be
detected for cortical (vehicle = 72 ± 52 mm3, BB3 2 mg/kg = 74 ± 42
mm3, BB3 6 mg/kg = 44 ± 45 mm3, F = 2.40, P = 0.10), subcortical
(vehicle = 48 ± 57 mm3, BB3 2 mg/kg = 32 ± 16 mm3, BB3 6 mg/
kg = 24 ± 19 mm3, F = 1.90, P = 0.16) and total cerebral infarct

Experiment 4: Delayed BB3 Treatment Onset Improves Neurologic
Function in Rat Temporary Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Outcome
Fifty-nine rats were randomized to experimental groups. Eight did
not meet the 60% LDF reduction and were excluded (three vehicle
and ﬁve BB3). Seven died during recovery (vehicle = 4, BB3 = 3).
Thus, 23 vehicle and 21 BB3 rats were used for ﬁnal analysis.
There were no substantive differences between groups for
physiologic values (Table 2). Neurologic scores at 28 days were
different (vehicle = 12 ± 4, BB3 = 6 ± 4, Po 0.0001, Figure 2A). No
difference was detected between groups for cortical (vehicle =
132 ± 61 mm3, BB3 = 94 ± 74 mm3, P = 0.07), subcortical (vehicle =
48 ± 19 mm3, BB3 = 41 ± 30 mm3, P = 0.32) or total (vehicle = 181 ±
69 mm3, BB3 = 134 ± 93 mm3, P = 0.07) infarct volumes. Neurologic
score was associated with total infarct size (neurologic score = 2.18
+0.04 × total infarct size; R2 = 0.57, Po 0.0001).

Figure 1. Pericranial temperature values for Experiment 2. Rats were subjected to either temporary (A) or permanent (B) middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) with pericranial temperature controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 °C during the ischemic insult (90 minutes in the pMCAO experiment)
and treated with 0, 2, 6, or 12 mg/kg BB3 at 90 minutes after ischemia onset. Pericranial temperature was measured over the subsequent
20 hours without efforts to control temperature so as to determine the uncontrolled response to ischemia and BB3 treatment. Surgery and
anesthesia caused a delayed post-ischemic hypothermia, which was transiently enhanced by BB3. Values = mean ± s.d.

Experiment 5: Delayed BB3 Treatment Onset Improves Neurologic
Function in Rat Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Outcome
Two rats in each treatment group died during the recovery period.
Peri-ischemic physiologic values were similar to those reported in
Table 2, with no differences between groups. The 28-day
neurologic scores were improved by BB3 (vehicle = 13 ± 1, BB3 =
10 ± 1, P = 0.007, Figure 2B). There also was a difference between
groups for cortical infarct volume (vehicle = 138 ± 40 mm3, BB3 =
106 ± 51 mm3, P = 0.04). Subcortical (vehicle = 35 ± 16 mm3,
BB3 = 33 ± 18 mm3, P = 0.69) and total (vehicle = 173 ± 49 mm3,
BB3 = 139 ± 65 mm3, P = 0.08) infarct volumes were not signiﬁcantly different. Neurologic score was associated with total infarct
size (neurologic score = 7.565+0.26 × total infarct size; R2 = 0.181,
P = 0.008).
Experiment 6: BB3 Delayed Treatment Onset Improves Neurologic
Function In Both Female And Male Rats After Temporary Middle
Cerebral Artery Occlusion Outcome
In both females and males, physiologic values were similar to
those reported in Table 2 and were similar between treatment
groups. In females, LDF was decreased by 68 ± 7% and 67 ± 5% in
the vehicle and BB3 groups, respectively (P = 0.70). One rat in each
group died during the recovery interval. The 28-day neurologic
scores in surviving rats were improved by BB3 (12 ± 5 versus 7 ± 5,

P = 0.02). A difference was not detected between vehicle and BB3
groups for cortical (108 ± 44 mm3 versus 94 ± 53 mm3, P = 0.40),
subcortical (36 ± 17 mm3 versus 33 ± 15 mm3, P = 0.55), or total
(144 ± 51 mm3 versus 127 ± 61 mm3, P = 0.37) infarct volumes,
respectively.
In males, LDF was decreased by 65 ± 6% and 64 ± 5% in the
vehicle and BB3 groups (P = 0.73), respectively. Two vehicle and
three BB3 rats died during recovery. The 28-day neurologic scores
in surviving rats were improved by BB3 (vehicle = 12 ± 5 versus
BB3 = 9 ± 4, P = 0.03). Cortical (120 ± 56 mm3 versus 129 ± 57 mm3,
P = 0.61), subcortical (34 ± 19 mm3 versus 35 ± 15 mm3, P = 0.96),
and total (154 ± 70 mm3 versus 164 ± 61 mm3, P = 0.66) infarct
volumes were not different between vehicle and BB3 groups,
respectively.
Experiment 7: BB3 Delayed Treatment Onset Improves Neurologic
Function in Aged Rats After Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion Outcome
Aged rats were clearly senescent with four dying spontaneously
before entry to the protocol and two showing clinical evidence of
anemia (pallor). These rats were not included. A total of 40 rats
were studied, with 21 randomized to BB3 and 19 to vehicle. All
rats received a neurologic score of ⩽ 2 on the day before pMCAO
onset (vehicle = 1 ± 1, BB3 = 1 ± 1, P = 0.79). Two vehicle and six
BB3 rats died during the 24-day recovery interval (P = 0.24). All

deaths occurred at ⩾ 7 days after ischemia onset. The cause could
not be determined. There was no effect of group assignment on
MAP over the 28-day recovery period (F = 0.334, P = 0.57), nor was
there an interaction between group and MAP (F = 0.70, P = 0.71).
BB3 improved neurologic score (vehicle = 17 ± 5, BB3 = 11 ± 6,
P = 0.009, Figure 2C). Importantly, the magnitude of neurologic
deﬁcit in the vehicle treatment group was greater than that
observed in the younger animals described above. Cortical
(43 ± 33 mm3 versus 35 ± 27 mm3, P = 0.47), subcortical (26 ±

(68 ± 42 mm3 versus 52 ± 37 mm3, P = 0.26) were not different
between vehicle and BB3 groups, respectively. Neurologic score
was associated with total infarct size (neurologic score = 9.12

Experiment 8: BB3 Is Efﬁcacious in a Mouse Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion Outcome Model
All mice met the LDF ﬂow reduction criterion of 80% from
baseline. No animals were excluded because of hemorrhage.
Mortality rates over the 8-week recovery interval were 50%, 60%,
30%, and 20% for the vehicle 10-minute, BB3 10-minute, vehicle
6-hour, and BB3 6-hour groups, respectively. We pooled the
vehicle 10-minute and vehicle 6-hour groups to improve statistical
power. This provided 12 vehicle, four BB3 10-minute, and eight
BB3 6-hour animals for ﬁnal outcome analysis. Outcome data are

treated with BB3 at 10 minutes after MCAO were superior to the
BB3 6-hour and vehicle groups in the tape-removal test. Corner
test performance tended to be superior in the BB3 10-minute
versus vehicle group. Both BB3 10-minute and BB3 6-hour mice
had superior performance on the grid-walk compared with
vehicle. There was no difference for the cylinder test.
Experiment 9: Delayed BB3 Treatment Does Not Affect StrokeInduced Edema
There was a main effect in the right (ipsilateral) hemisphere
(P o 0.001) for ischemia, but not BB3. Both vehicle (81.7 ± 1.0%,
P = 0.002) and BB3 (82.4 ± 1.2%, P o 0.001) groups had greater
water content than naive rats (79.6 ± 0.3%). There were no differences among groups in the contralateral hemisphere (naive =
79.5 ± 0.4%, vehicle = 79.0 ± 0.4%, BB3 = 79.9 ± 0.4%, P = 0.23).

For synaptophysin, a main effect was present for treatment
group (F = 6.44, P = 0.01) in the ipsilateral cortex. Post hoc
comparison found an increase in synaptophysin in rats treated
with BB3 for 28 days versus vehicle (P = 0.01, Figure 5). There was
no effect of BB3 treatment in the contralateral cortex (P = 0.81).
DISCUSSION
Results from this study, designed to conform to STAIR and Good
Laboratory Practice guidelines,23,24 suggest that the HGF pathway
can potentially be harnessed for neurologic beneﬁt in ischemic
stroke with use of a small molecule. The extent to which STAIR and
Good Laboratory Practice guidelines have been met is detailed in
the Supplementary Table. With BB3 approaching end-of-Phase II
studies in renal recipients and awarded both Fast-Track and
Orphan Status by the United States Food and Drug Administration
for that indication, from a clinical developmental perspective this
therapeutic also holds promise for stroke survivors.
We have herein demonstrated that BB3 (1) crosses the BBB, (2)
exerts dose-dependent effects within a dose range consistent with
Investigational New Drug-enabling toxicology analysis, (3) exerts
functional efﬁcacy in male rats subjected to sustained postischemic pericranial thermoregulation for both tMCAO and
pMCAO and long-term recovery (4 weeks), (4) exerts functional
efﬁcacy in female rats, (5) promotes functional efﬁcacy in aged rats
subjected to pMCAO and long-term recovery in the absence of

blood pressure effects, and (7) has a therapeutic window of at
least 6 hours in rats and at least 10 minutes in mice. The enhanced
c-Met phosphorylation and increased synaptophysin expression
observed in the ischemic cortex of the BB3-treated cohort are
consistent with expected functions of an HGF-like compound.
In the context of acute brain injury, HGF’s neurotrophic
properties may be an advantage to both post-ischemic resident
and stem cell-derived tissue.16,34,35 Of particular interest was the
report of Shang et al17 in which recombinant human HGF was
applied topically to the cortex immediately after MCAO. Hepatocyte growth factor decreased infarct size, whereas neurogenesis,
angiogenesis, and synaptogenesis were increased at 14 days after
ischemia, in contrast to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor,
which decreased infarct size only. Neurologic function, the most
clinically relevant end point, was not measured. Doeppner et al16
subjected mice to 3 days of post-tMCAO intrastriatal HGF
beginning immediately after reperfusion onset. Motor coordination was assessed over 28 days recovery. Hepatocyte growth
factor ameliorated post-MCAO motor deﬁcits and this was
associated with post-ischemic neurogenesis and inhibition of
matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Of note, both infarct size and
Evan’s blue extravasation were decreased at 24 hours after MCAO
and infarct size remained decreased on day 7 with an intermediate, but not low HGF dose. The metalloproteinase inhibitor
BB-1101 emulated the effect of HGF on infarct size implicating this
pathway in the efﬁcacious response.
Findings from the current experiment using a small molecule
HGF-like compound can be contrasted with these ﬁndings.

Evidence varies with respect to HGF BBB penetration. Pan et al36
reported substantial blood to brain transfer of intravenously
injected radiolabeled-HGF in mice and implicated a transporter
system. In contrast, Kern et al13 found no correlation between
serum and cerebrospinal ﬂuid HGF concentrations in patients with
bacterial meningitis. Radiolabelled-BB3 was found to have rapid
and substantial BBB penetration. This suggests a therapeutic
advantage over HGF protein, as all preclinical stroke studies, to
date, have used direct HGF microinjection or viral transfection into
the brain.
Of note, our study found little beneﬁt from BB3 on cerebral
infarct size, which corresponded with a lack of BB3 effect on acute
brain water content. This is in contrast to studies using HGF. Thus,
BB3 appears provide functional beneﬁt through a sustained

neurorestorative effect, consistent with the observed increase in
synaptophysin expression. It is plausible that BB3 lacks some
properties associated with HGF. Alternatively, the preponderance
of our work was performed with a 6-hour delay to treatment onset
and long-term outcome analysis, in contrast to HGF studies that
used either pretreatment or immediate post-reperfusion treatment paradigms for infarct volume analysis.16,34,37 A delay to
treatment onset of 6 hours would presumably occur after considerable irreversible ischemic injury is present, but before
completion of full infarct evolution.38 Although this may explain
the lack of a substantive effect of BB3 on infarct size in the rat
experiments, we would have expected an effect on infarct size in
the mouse study where treatment onset began 10 minutes after
reperfusion. Doeppner et al16 reported that HGF effects on postMCAO infarct size were dose-dependent. BB3 may offer greater
beneﬁt at doses higher than those investigated herein. However,
to the extent rat studies are predictive, this would present major
clinical challenge. Higher BB3 doses examined in Experiment 2
(Figure 1) caused major and sustained hypothermia, which
currently is not indicated for ischemic stroke and would be
dose-limiting. Our study may also have been underpowered to
detect a BB3 effect on rat infarct size if an effect was present,
given the small magnitude of difference between treated and
untreated animals. Sample sizes were calculated to detect a 37%
decrease in infarct size on the basis of our previous experience
with this model.27 Cerebral infarct volume was numerically
decreased in BB3-treated animals in all the experiments except
male rats in Experiment 6 and mice in Experiment 8, but the effect
size was substantially less than the study was powered to detect.
Finally, all of our measures of infarct size occurred at 2 to 8 weeks
after ischemia. It is plausible that BB3 delayed infarct maturation,
albeit ﬁnal infarct size became similar over time. Hence, we cannot
rule out a direct effect of BB3 on infarct size as a potential
contributor to the consistent improvement in neurologic function
observed throughout the series of experiments.
BB3 consistently improved functional performance independent of sex, age, rodent species, or temporary versus permanent
MCAO and studies were conducted in three independent laboratories. Improved functional performance was present in all rat
studies. The scoring system we used includes the major elements
of the classic Bederson and Garcia scoring systems.39,40 We believe
the scoring system is valid in that it has repeatedly correlated with
cerebral infarct size.26,27 Despite the potential maximal neurologic
deﬁcit score of 48 with this system, rats with scores in excess of 15
are typically moribund with major gross neurologic deﬁcit. As a
result, insult severity (i.e., ischemia duration) was titrated to
produce the maximal deﬁcit consistent with long-term recovery
under laboratory husbandry conditions. BB3 also showed beneﬁt
in two of four functional measures in mice, with a strong trend for
beneﬁt in a third. The implications of the functional effect size in
rodents for clinical translation are unknown. No molecule has
successfully translated from bench to bedside that we can use as a
standard to deﬁne a preclinical effect size sufﬁcient to predict that
a clinical effect could be detected. It is possible that the BB3 effect
size is not sufﬁcient; yet, given the robustness of the effect
observed across models and laboratories, we believe that continued BB3 development is warranted. This is particularly true
because the compound exists as a pharmaceutical grade substance, has completed clinical phase I testing and is in
international multicenter phase II trials for a renal indication.
Although the work to date is comprehensive and rigorous, one
weakness may be the absence of sham-operated rats (and mice),
which could provide a reference for functional changes attributable to anesthesia, surgery, and/or aging over the 4- to 8-week
recovery intervals. Shams were not included to conserve statistical
power and time, but this may limit interpretation. In contrast, preischemic neurologic function, as determined by our standardized
scoring system, found negligible deﬁcits in aged rats despite

obvious senescence. Hence, it is unlikely that sham-operated
controls would present persistent neurologic deﬁcits over the
extended recovery periods used. Additional functional testing,
including assessment of cognitive factors, may provide a more
sensitive measure of efﬁcacy.
This constellation of data is consistent with potential clinical
efﬁcacy. However, data remain lacking for (1) efﬁcacy in the
context of comorbidities common to stroke patients, (2) interactions with drugs commonly encountered in stroke patients, (3)
and efﬁcacy by a route of administration consistent with clinical
use (e.g., intravenous) with minimum and maximum tolerated
doses deﬁned. Further, a treatment duration-response experiment
has not been performed to determine the minimal treatment
duration necessary to obtain maximal therapeutic beneﬁt.
Consequently, it remains premature to recommend advancement
of BB3 to clinical trial status in ischemic stroke until this additional
research is completed.
In conclusion, a series of experiments was performed using the
STAIR and Good Laboratory Practice guidelines to determine
preclinical efﬁcacy of the HGF-like small molecule BB3 in focal
ischemic stroke. Using rigorous pericranial temperature control
during and for 20 hours after ischemia, rats treated with BB3 for
14 days beginning 6 hours after tMCAO reperfusion (or pMCAO
onset) exhibited improved neurologic function after a 28-day
recovery interval without a detectable effect on cerebral infarct

size. BB3 efﬁcacy was independent of laboratory, sex, age, or
MCAO model and persisted with sustained strict post-ischemic
pericranial temperature control. Mice appeared to have a narrower
therapeutic window with efﬁcacy noted with treatment onset at
10 minutes, but not 6 hours after MCAO reperfusion. On the basis
of the large body of positive data presented, BB3 warrants further
investigation as a neurorestorative agent after ischemic stroke.
