a b s t r a c t
Both peptidic agonist exenatide and herbal agonist catalpol of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
(GLP-1R) are neuroprotective. We have previously shown that activation of spinal GLP-1Rs expresses
␤-endorphin in microglia to produce antinociception. The aim of this study was to explore whether
exenatide and catalpol exert neuroprotection via activation of the hippocampal GLP-1R/␤-endorphin
pathway. The rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model was employed, and the GLP-1R immunoﬂuorescence staining and ␤-endorphin measurement were assayed in the hippocampus and primary cultures
of microglia, neurons and astrocytes. The immunoreactivity of GLP-1Rs on microglia in the hippocampus was upregulated after ischemia reperfusion. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of exenatide and
catalpol produced neuroprotection in the rat transient ischemia/reperfusion model, reﬂected by a marked
reduction in brain infarction size and a mild recovery in neurobehavioral deﬁcits. In addition, i.c.v. injection of exenatide and catalpol signiﬁcantly stimulated ␤-endorphin expression in the hippocampus and
cultured primary microglia (but not primary neurons or astrocytes). Furthermore, exenatide and catalpol
neuroprotection was completely blocked by i.c.v. injection of the GLP-1R orthosteric antagonist exendin
(9–39), speciﬁc ␤-endorphin antiserum, and selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Our results
indicate, for the ﬁrst time, that the neuroprotective effects of catalpol and exenatide are GLP-1R-speciﬁc,
and that these effects are mediated by ␤-endorphin expression probably in hippocampal microglia. We
postulate that in contrast to the peripheral tissue, where the activation of GLP-1Rs in pancreas islet ␤-cells
causes secretion of insulin to perform glucoregulation, it leads to ␤-endorphin expression in microglial
cells to produce neuroprotection and analgesia in the central nervous system.

1. Introduction
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) are distributed in
various tissues, including the pancreatic islets and lungs, the cardiovascular system, and the central nervous system, but not in the
skeletal muscle [1–6]. In the central nervous system, GLP-1Rs are
located in the cortex, neocortex, hypothalamus, brainstem, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord [2,7–12]. GLP-1Rs modulate
central neuronal activity and protect against neuronal damage
induced by various insults [13–15]. Rapidly accumulating evidence suggests that the GLP-1R agonists exenatide and GLP-1,
used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, also display

neuroprotective properties in multiple models of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
amyothrophic lateral sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, multiple
sclerosis, ischemia, and stroke [11,14,16–22]. However, the mechanisms and signal transduction underlying the neuroprotective
effects of GLP-1R are not clear. It is reported the neuroprotective
effects of GLP-1R stimulation on cultured primary cortical neurons,
suggesting a neuronal mechanism [14]. In contrast, exenatide was
reported to exert neuroprotection via blocking 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced microglial activation
and reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 and
stimulated proinﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-␣ and IL-1␤) in substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum [21]. Activation of
GLP-1Rs was also reported to increase the expression of the proinﬂammatory cytokines in the hypothalamus and the hindbrain [23],
or have no effect on proinﬂammatory cytokine expression in the
spinal cord or cultured primary microglia [24]. On the other hand,
exenatide was shown to stimulate neurogenesis, which serves a

Y. Jia et al. / Pharmacological Research 102 (2015) 276–285

possible mechanism by which the peptide might restore function
in a damaged system [16,18].
We recently identiﬁed the GLP-1R/␤-endorphin antinociceptive
pathway in the spinal cord. GLP-1Rs were exclusively expressed
in the spinal dorsal horn microglial cells, and were consequently
upgraded accompanying microglial activation following peripheral
nerve injury. The peptidic agonists GLP-1 (7–36) and exenatide,
non-peptidic agonist WB4-24, and herbal agonist shanzhiside
methylester of GLP-1R produced anti-hypersensitivity in a variety of animal models of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain,
inﬂammatory pain, bone cancer pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy. These GLP-1R agonists stimulated ␤-endorphin expression
in spinal dorsal horn or cultured primary microglial cells from
the spinal cord. The antinociceptive effects of exenatide, GLP-1,
WB4-24 and shanzhiside methylester were completely blocked by
the microglial inhibitor minocycline, speciﬁc ␤-endorphin antiserum (but not the dynorphin A antiserum), and opioid receptor
antagonist naloxone or selective ␮-opioid receptor antagonist
CTAP [2,24,25]. It is not known whether the GLP-1R/␤-endorphin
pathway also exists in the hippocampus, and whether exenatide
produces neuroprotection via this pathway.
Catalpol is an important iridoid glycoside puriﬁed from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, which has been widely used as a traditional
Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of aging diseases and
stroke. In the previous studies, catalpol signiﬁcantly attenuated
apoptosis, rescued hippocampal CA1 neurons, and reduced cognitive impairment in the transient focal and global cerebral ischemic
models in gerbils [26,27]. It was also recently reported that catalpol
signiﬁcantly facilitated neurological function recovery, reduced
infarction volume, and increased cerebral blood ﬂow in a mouse
stroke model [28]. It improved memory and protected the forebrain
neurons from neurodegeneration in a neurodegenerative mouse
model [29]. These results indicated that catalpol was an active
ingredient which could reduce ischemic damage and enhance
memory. We recently discovered that catalpol was an orthosteric
agonist of GLP-1Rs that functioned similarly in humans and rats
and presumably acted at the same binding site as exendin (9–39). In
addition, intrathecal injection of catalpol blocked formalin-induced
tonic pain and its antinociceptive effect was completely blocked
by exendin (9–39) [30]. It is not known whether the neuroprotective effect of catalpol is via activation of GLP-1Rs in the brain and
subsequent expression of ␤-endorphin.
In this study, we explored the possible involvement of the
hippocampal microglial GLP-1R/␤-endorphin pathway in the neuroprotective effects of both exenatide and catalpol. We ﬁrst
conﬁrmed the neuroprotective effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of exenatide and catalpol in a rat transient
ischemia/reperfusion model. We then tested whether the GLP-1R
antagonist exendin (9–39) blocked the i.c.v. injection of catalpoland exenatide-induced neuroprotection. We further examined
whether treatment with exenatide and catalpol stimulated ␤endorphin expression in the hippocampus and primary cultures of
microglia. We ﬁnally tested whether i.c.v. injection of the speciﬁc
␤-endorphin antiserum and selective opioid receptor antagonist
naloxone reversed the neuroprotective effects of exenatide and
catalpol. Our results suggest, for the ﬁrst time, that exenatide and
catalpol exert their neuroprotective effects via stimulation of the
GLP-1R/␤-endorphin pathway probably in hippocampal microglia.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and drugs
Male adult and 1-day old neonatal Wistar rats (250–300 g),
purchased from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Institute for

277

Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China), were maintained under
temperature- and light-controlled conditions (20–24 ◦ C), 12-h
light/dark cycle) with continuous access to food and water. The rats
were acclimated to the laboratory environment for 3–5 days before
the study began. All of the experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Welfare Committee of the Shanghai
Jiao Tong University, and followed the animal care guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health.
Exenatide and exendin (9–39) were obtained from Kaijie
Bio-Pharmaceutical Co. (Chengdu, China) and Shanghai TASH
Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China). Catalpol (purity ∼98% by
HPLC) and naloxone hydrochloride were purchased from Biopurity
Phytochemicals (Chengdu, China) and Sigma–Aldrich (Shanghai,
China), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies neutralizing ␤-endorphin was purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals
(Burlingame, CA, USA). Based on the manufacturer’s information, the ␤-endorphin antiserum was speciﬁc to ␤-endorphin
and did not cross-react with methionine-enkephalin, leucineenkaphalin, dynorphin A or B, ␥-endorphin, ␣-endorphin, ACTH or
␣-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. All of the drugs or reagents
were freshly dissolved in saline before use.
2.1.1. Immunoﬂuorescence staining [2]
Single and double immunoﬂuorescence labeling of the GLP1R and microglia were performed on the hippocampi. Rats were
anesthetized by pentobarbital injection (50 mg/kg) and intracardially perfused with 500 mL normal saline followed by 300 mL of
4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) in phosphate buffered saline. The
brain of each rat was rapidly removed and the complete hippocampus was collected and ﬁxed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at
4 ◦ C for 24 h. Tissues were entrapped in OCT embedding agent
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and cut into 40 ␮m-thick
frozen sections, which were then incubated with GLP-1R antibody (ab119287, 1:100, rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
and OX42 antibody (ab1211, 1:200, mouse polyclonal, Abcam)
for microglia at 4 ◦ C for 24 h. The GLP-1R antibody was tested
for optimal dilution and nonspeciﬁc staining [2]. The GLP-1R and
OX42 antibodies were visualized with Alexa 555-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (1:200, Invitrogen), respectively. DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, Sigma–Aldrich) staining was used to determine the
cell nuclei.
The OX42 and GLP-1R-immunopositive cell proﬁles were
quantiﬁed using a Leica TCS SP5II confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems). Identical confocal acquisition parameters were set
for GLP-1R and OX42 staining, including objective, laser power,
photomultiplier gain and offset, emission window, pinhole, and
speed. Images of the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions were captured under 10× magniﬁcation. All positively stained cells in the
stratum lacunosum moleculare layer of the CA1 region were measured using a computer-assisted image analysis program (Image
J Software, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) in a blinded
fashion. Low and high thresholds were set to exclude background
ﬂuorescence and to include immunoﬂuorescent intensity measurements only from positively stained cell surfaces. We determined
the thresholds visually be moving the cursor in the displayed histogram until all the background pixels in the image were darkened;
the intensity value at the position of the cursor was taken as
the threshold value for the channel. The cell showing a two-fold
more intense staining than the average background was considered positive. A colocalization analysis was performed using Image
J software with a Colocalization Finder to generate images in which
colocalized pixels appeared as white. The same threshold value
conﬁguration was used to measure all of the surface areas in each
experimental group at the same time. The measured areas were

278

imported into the Excel automatically and the Image J program
was calibrated to provide standardized area measurements. The
GLP-1R and OX42-immunolabeled surface areas were measured in
brain slices (thickness: 40 ␮m, −3.6 mm to −4.3 mm to the bregma)
by a researcher blinded to the experimental conditions. The averaged percentage immunolabeled surface area was the fraction of
the positive immunoﬂuorescent surface area of the hippocampus
CA1 area from three sections of each brain. The data from six rats
from each group were then calculated.
2.1.2. Primary cultures of neurons and glial cells [2]
Neurons and glial cells were isolated from the hippocampus
of 1-day-old neonatal rats. The isolated hippocampi was minced
and incubated with trypsin. Dissociated cells were suspended in
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum and penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 ␮g/mL). For the neuronal culture, cell suspensions
were plated in plates pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (100 ␮g/mL).
After 1.5 h of incubation, the medium was changed to Neurobasal
(Invitrogen) containing B27 supplement and 0.5 mM glutamine for
further culture. All experiments were initiated 5–6 days after plating. Harvested neurons showed a purity >85%, as determined by
NeuN immunoreactivity.
For glial cell cultures, cell suspensions of minced hippocampi
were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture ﬂasks (1 × 107 cells/ﬂask)
pre-coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in a 5% carbon
dioxide incubator at 37 ◦ C. After culture for 8 days, microglial
cells were prepared as ﬂoating cell suspensions by shaking the
ﬂasks at 260 rpm for 2 h. The aliquots were transferred to plates
and unattached cells were removed by washing with serumfree DMEM. Harvested microglial cells showed a purity >95%,
as determined by OX42 immunoreactivity. After culture for 11
days, astrocytes were prepared as ﬂoating cell suspensions by
shaking the ﬂasks for 2 h followed by incubation with 10 mL of
0.05% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Invitrogen) in a cell
incubator for 15 min to separate the oligodendrocytes from the
astrocytes. After trypsin neutralization with 10 mL of complete
media, the ﬂoating cell suspensions were discarded. A nearly intact
layer of astrocytes in the bed layer were then trypsinized and subcultured conventionally. Prepared astrocytes showed a purity >90%,
as determined by GFAP immunoreactivity.
2.1.3. ˇ-Endorphin measurement [2]
The ␤-endorphin concentrations were measured in the ipsilateral hippocampi from ischemic rats and primary cultures of
neurons and glial cells. The ipsilateral hippocampi were taken,
homogenized (4000 rpm) for 15 s in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) (1 g
tissue/5 mL Tris–HCl) by a homogenizer (Fluko Equipment Co.,
Shanghai, China), and centrifuged (4000 rpm) at 4 ◦ C for 15 min.
The protein content was measured using a standard BCA protein
assay (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). For primary cultures, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia originated from
the hippocampi of 1-day-old neonatal rats were placed in 24-well
plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and washed twice with 1 mL of warm
DMEM containing 2 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin and 15 mM N(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N -2-ethanesulfonic acid. Cells were
exposed to different concentrations of exenatide and catalpol for
2 h and supernatant samples were processed.
The ␤-endorphin concentration was determined using an
enzyme-linked ﬂuorescent immunoassay kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, CA, USA) with the linear standard curve of 29.6–608 pg/ml.
The cross-activity of the assay included ␣-endorphin (100%) and
␥-endorphin (60%), but not methionine-enkephalin (0%) or leucineenkephalin (0%), according to the manufacturer’s information. The
relative ﬂuorescence units were measured with a ﬂuorescence
microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland) and the

concentrations of samples were determined by comparison with a
calibration curve running at the same time.
2.1.4. Rat I.C.V. catheterization and injection [31]
The rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(50 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and placed on a stereotaxic
apparatus (Stoelting Company, Wood Dale, IL). After the skull was
exposed, a 24-gauge guide cannula (0.55 mm) was stereotaxically
implanted 3 mm above the left lateral ventricle (anterior-posterior:
−1.1 mm from the bregma; mediolateral: −1.5 mm; dorsal ventral:
+2.8 mm below the surface of the skull). The guide cannula was
anchored by enhanced plasma glass cement type I, which is used
in dentistry. The guide cannula was kept viable with the use of
a dummy cannula to prevent it from blocking. The animals were
allowed to return to their home cages and recover for at least 7 days
before undergoing the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
operation. The control vehicle and test drugs in 5 ␮L were slowly
injected using a 30-gauge cannula extended 1 mm beyond the guide
cannula and connected to a 10-␮L microsyringe via a polyethylene
tube, which remained in place for 30 s to allow for diffusion.
2.1.5. The rat MCAO model [32]
MCAO, an animal stroke model that closely resembles the most
common form of human stroke, was induced in the left side using
the intraluminal ﬁlament technique [14]. Brieﬂy, the male adult
Wistar rats (250–300 g) were anaesthetized by inhalation of 1.0%
isoﬂurane and their body temperature was maintained at 37–38 ◦ C
using a heating pad. The common and external carotid arteries were
ligated, and the internal carotid artery was temporarily closed. Two
slipknots were made at the external carotid arteries, near to the
bifurcation site of the common carotid arteries, and a small hole
was cut on the external carotid arteries between the two knots. A
4-0 nylon monoﬁlament (Shadong Biotech, Beijing, China) coated
with a silicone tip was advanced 1.8–1.9 cm from the bifurcation
site, through the internal carotid artery, to the origin of the middle
cerebral artery. The slipknot at the external carotid arteries was
tightened and the wound was closed. The animals were allowed to
wake up and were placed in their cage. After occlusion for 60 min,
they were anaesthetized again and the ﬁlament was withdrawn for
reperfusion. Two days later, the rats underwent neurobehavioral
testing and evaluation of the infarct areas.
2.1.6. Neurobehavioral testing [33]
The neurological status of each rat was evaluated 2 days after
ischemia reperfusion according to the Zea-Longa neurological
grading scale. Grades were based on the degree of contralateral
hemiparesis: 0 = no observable deﬁcit; 1 = failure to extend the ipsilateral forepaw; 2 = circling to the ipsilateral side; 3 = falling to the
ipsilateral side; and 4 = unable to walk spontaneously and with a
depressed level of consciousness.
2.1.7. Evaluation of infarct areas [34]
The animals were killed 48 h after the MCAO reperfusion
and evaluation of the neurological assessment. The brains were
removed rapidly, with the ﬁrst knife point at the midpoint between
the anterior pole of the brain and the optic chiasma. The brains were
sliced into consecutive 6 sections of 2.0 mm-thick from anterior
to posterior, and incubated in 2% w/v 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma–Aldrich) at 37 ◦ C for 15 min. The stained
slices were then ﬁxed by immersion in phosphate-buffered 4%
paraformaldehyde for 8–9 h. To determine the infarct area by TTC
staining, the images of the 6 sections were shot using a Sony DSCHX7 camera with the same parameter settings, and the acquired
images were processed by a blinded observer using the Adobe Photoshop CS2 program (Adobe System, CA, USA). To correct the effects

Fig. 1. Up-regulation of GLP-1Rs immunoreactivity in microglia after ischemia reperfusion. Brain tissues were collected 48 h after ischemia/reperfusion. Representative

microglia marker OX42 (a, b) and GLP-1Rs (d, e), and merged images (g, h). GLP-1R-, OX42- and their co-immunolabeled surface areas in the stratum lacunosum moleculare
layer were quantiﬁed by using the image J program (c, f, i). Scale bars: 100 ␮m. Brain tissues slices: 40 ␮m (−3.6 mm ∼ −4.3 mm to the bregma). Data are presented as

of cerebral edema and differential shrinkage resulting from tissue processing, the infarction area in each section was calculated
by subtracting the area of the healthy, uninfarcted (TTC-stained)
tissue in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the area of the contralateral hemisphere as described previously [35]. The infarction area
of each brain slice was expressed as a percentage (%) hemispheric
infarction area = (contralateral hemispheric area − uninfarcted area
of ipsilateral hemisphere)/contralateral hemispheric area × 100%.
The infarction area of the brain was calculated by averaging the
infarction areas of all 6 sections.

dent t-tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as indicated.
A Student–Newman–Keuls post-hoc test was performed when a
statistically signiﬁcant drug effect was observed. The criterion P
value for statistical signiﬁcance was 0.05. All data calculations and
statistics analysis were performed in the GraphPad Prism Program
(version 5.01, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
3. Results
3.1. The immunoreactivity of GLP-1R on microglia was
upregulated after ischemia reperfusion

2.2. Data analysis and statistical evaluation
Data are presented as means ± SEM, and there were no missing data. The sample size of the animal studies was chosen
on the experience that six to eight rats might be sufﬁcient to
show statistical signiﬁcance for the more than 40% differences
(from the preliminary experiments) of infarct areas, neurobehavioral deﬁcits, GLP-1R upgrade, and ␤-endorphin increment
compared to the respective controls, with reasonable standard
deviations. Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated by paired Stu-

We previously identiﬁed that spinal dorsal horn GLP-1Rs were
speciﬁcally expressed on spinal microglial cells, and upregulated accompanying microglial proliferation and hypertrophy after
peripheral nerve injury [2]. The activation of microglia in response
to ischemia/reperfusion was also reported, and the inﬂammatory response peaked at 48–72 h in the ischemia model [2,36,37].
In this study, we evaluated the ischemia reperfusion-induced
changes in GLP-1Rs and microglia in the hippocampus by harvesting brains from six rats 48 h after they were subjected to

transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Hippocampal sections from both the contralateral and ipsilateral sides (Fig. 1a and
b) revealed a typical microglial immunostaining pattern (marked
by CD11b/OX42), as highly ramiﬁed cells spread throughout the
hippocampus. Several hippocampal regions could be discerned
by their differential immunostaining intensity, i.e., the more
intensely stained areas included the stratum lacunosum moleculare layer of the CA1 region and the hilus of the dentate gyrus
region. In contrast, the stratum pyramidal cell layer was demarcated by its relative lack of immunoﬂuorescence immunostaining.
After ischemia-reperfusion, increased microglial immunoreactivity became apparent in the ipsilateral side, and more prominently
in the stratum lacunosum moleculare layer of the CA1 region.
Following ischemia, the microglial immunostaining in the stratum lacunosum moleculare layer was upregulated by 60.7%, as
measured using the computer-assisted image analysis program
(P < 0.05, paired Student t-test) (Fig. 1c). In addition, the expression pattern of GLP-1R immunoﬂuorescence was similar to that of
CD11b in both the contralateral and ipsilateral sides (Fig. 1d and
e), with an upregulated expression of 48.1% in the ipsilateral side
(P < 0.05, paired Student t-test) (Fig. 1f). Finally, the co-localization
staining of OX42 and GLP-1R was expressed in both the contralateral and ipsilateral sides (Fig. 1g and h). Ischemia-induced GLP-1R
overexpression was seen predominantly in microglia, with little GLP-1R labeling in other cell types. Ischemia upregulated the
co-localization immunoﬂuorescence staining of the GLP-1R and
microglial marker OX42 in the ipsilateral side by 43.5% compared
to the contralateral side (P < 0.05, paired Student t-test) (Fig. 1i),
although it is unclear whether GLP-1R induction is primarily due
to the induction of microglial cell numbers, or due to its enhanced
expression in microglial cells.

3.2. Exenatide and catalpol reduced infarction and improved
neurobehavioral manifestation
The neuroprotective effects of exenatide and catalpol were studied in ischemic rats through the intraventricular route as peptidic
exenatide is not orally–available and does not readily pass the blood
brain barrier although catalpol can be given systemically as an
herbal ingredient. Four groups of rats (n = 6 in each group) received
an i.c.v. injection of saline (5 ␮L), exenatide (300 ng), or catalpol
(100 ␮g) 15 min before occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery,
followed by reperfusion operation 1 h later. The doses of exenatide
and catalpol were selected from previous studies [2,30]. The rats
underwent neurobehavioral testing and infarct area evaluation 2
days after ischemia/reperfusion. Fig. 2a shows photographs of six
consecutive slices from one representative brain sample from each
group. All of the portions of the brain slices from the sham rat
were stained red, whereas a 1-h transient occlusion in the vehicletreated MCAO rats produced a signiﬁcant infarction within the left
cerebral cortex, indicated by white matter, due to no reaction with
TTC. Exenatide and catalpol markedly reduced the white infarct
area. The summarized results from the four groups of rats showed
that ischemia-reperfusion induced approximately 40% brain infarction in the ipsilateral hemispheres; i.c.v. injection of exenatide and
catalpol reduced the infarction by approximately 80% (P < 0.05, oneway ANOVA followed by post-hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test)
(Fig. 2b). Ischemia-reperfusion also had marked effects on the rats’
neurobehaviors, reﬂected by an increase in neurobehavioral scores
to 3.0. The i.c.v. injection of exenatide and catalpol slightly but
signiﬁcantly restored neurobehavioral scores by 22–26% (P < 0.05,
one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Student–Newman–Keuls
test) (Fig. 2C). The infarction area was selected for the later mechanism studies.

treatment. Two days after reperfusion, the brain was removed for infarction staining. Data are presented as means ± SEM (n = 6–8 in each group). a and b Denote
the statistical signiﬁcance compared to the saline control group and the exenatide
or catalpol group, respectively (P < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA, followed by post-hoc
Student–Newman–Keuls test).

3.3. Exendin (9–39) prevented exenatide and catalpol
neuroprotection
Exendin (9–39) is a competitive antagonist that binds the
GLP-1R [38,39]. To examine whether exenatide and catalpol produced their neuroprotective effects via the activation of GLP-1Rs,
exendin (9–39) was used in the rat transient ischemia/reperfusion
model. Six groups of rats (n = 6–8 in each group) received two i.c.v.
injections of the control and test substances 15 min before the
occlusion of the middle artery, followed by reperfusion 1 h later.
The treatments were as follows: 5 ␮L saline + 5 ␮L saline, 15 ␮g
exendin (9–39) + 5 ␮L saline, 5 ␮L saline + 300 ng exenatide, 5 ␮L
saline + 100 ␮g catalpol, 15 ␮g exendin (9–39) + 300 ng exenatide,
and 15 ␮g exendin (9–39) + 100 ␮g catalpol. The second treatment
was administered 15 min after the ﬁrst one. Fig. 3a shows photographs of six consecutive slices from one representative brain
sample from each group. Compared with the saline-treated control rats, i.c.v. injection of exendin (9–39) alone did not have a
signiﬁcant effect on the ischemia reperfusion-induced infarction.
However, i.c.v. treatment with exenatide and catalpol signiﬁcantly
reduced the infarction by 49.4% and 68.3%, respectively. Pretreatment with exendin (9–39) completely prevented the protective

In our previous study, we showed that exenatide stimulated
the expression of ␤-endorphin in the spinal cord [2]. In this study,
we further tested whether exenatide and catalpol stimulated the
expression of ␤-endorphin in the hippocampus. Three groups of
rats (n = 6–7 in each group) received an i.c.v. injection of saline
(5 ␮L), exenatide (300 ng), or catalpol (100 ␮g) 15 min before the
occlusion of the middle artery, followed by reperfusion 1 h later.
The brain was removed 30 min after reperfusion and ipsilateral
hippocampal homogenates were used to measure ␤-endorphin levels using a speciﬁc ﬂuorescent immunoassay kit. Compared with
the saline group, both exenatide and catalpol markedly increased
␤-endorphin levels by 50.6% and 45.2%, respectively (P < 0.05, oneway ANOVA followed by post-hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test)
(Fig. 4).
Furthermore, microglial cells originated from the hippocampus were treated with different concentrations (3 × 10−9 , 1 × 10−9 ,
3 × 10−8 , 1 × 10−8 , 3 × 10−7 , and 1 × 10−7 M) of exenatide, or different concentrations (1 × 10−5 , 3 × 10−5 , 1 × 10−4 , 3 × 10−4 , 1 × 10−3 ,
and 3 × 10−3 M) of catalpol, and the level of ␤-endorphin in culture medium were measured 2 h later. Exenatide stimulated the
␤-endorphin release into the culture medium in a concentrationdependent manner, with an EC50 of 7.6 nM (Fig. 5a). Catalpol
also concentration-dependently stimulated ␤-endorphin release
from cultured primary microglia, with an EC50 value of 119 ␮M
(Fig. 5b). In contrast, exenatide at 30 nM (Fig. 5c), or catalpol at
1 mM (Fig. 5d), did not affect ␤-endorphin secretion from primary
cultures of neurons or astrocytes.
3.5. ˇ-Endorphin antiserum and naloxone reversed exenatide
and catalpol neuroprotection
To test whether exenatide and catalpol exerted their neuroprotective effects via ␤-endorphin expression, we used the
speciﬁc ␤-endorphin antiserum and opioid receptor antagonist
naloxone. Nine groups of rats (n = 8 in each group) received two
i.c.v. injections of the control and test substances 15 min before
the occlusion of the middle artery, followed by reperfusion 1 h
later. The treatments were as follows: 5 ␮L saline + 5 ␮L saline,
5 ␮L ␤-endorphin antiserum + 5 ␮L saline, 20 ␮g naloxone + 5 ␮L

saline, 5 ␮L saline + 300 ng exenatide, 5 ␮L saline + 100 ␮g catalpol,
5 ␮L ␤-endorphin antiserum + 300 ng exenatide, 5 ␮L ␤-endorphin
antiserum + 100 ␮g catalpol, 20 ␮g naloxone + 300 ng exenatide,
and 20 ␮g naloxone + 100 ␮g catalpol. The second treatment was
administered 15 min after the ﬁrst one. Fig. 6a shows photographs
of six consecutive slices from one representative brain sample from each group. Neither i.c.v. injection of the ␤-endorphin
antiserum alone nor naloxone alone signiﬁcantly altered the
ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain infarction compared to the
saline control rats, whereas exenatide and catalpol signiﬁcantly
reduced the infarct area by 67.4% and 59.1%, respectively. Pretreatment with the ␤-endorphin antiserum (without dilution)
signiﬁcantly reversed the protective effects of exenatide and
catalpol in infarction by approximately 74% and 77%, respectively. The preliminary results showed that the 1:5 dilution of
␤-endorphin antiserum was not effective in reducing the protective
effect of exenatide or catalpol (data not shown). In addition, pretreatment with naloxone completely blocked the protective effects
of exenatide and catalpol (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by
post-hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test) (Fig. 6b).
4. Discussion
Many studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have indicated the
therapeutic potential of exenatide in neurodegenerative disorders,
and that GLP-1Rs appear to be the key in mediating these effects.
Our results showed that in the rat ischemia/reperfusion model,
a single lateral ventricular injection of exenatide produced neu-

roprotection, indicated by a marked reduction in the extent of
brain infarction and a mild recovery of neurobehavioral deﬁcits.
The results are consistent with the recent ﬁndings of several studies, in which exenatide treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the brain
infarct volume or neuronal loss in the CA1 region and improved
functional deﬁcits in the transient focal cerebral ischemia models
of mice, rats, and gerbils [12,14,40]. Our results further showed
that i.c.v. injection of the GLP-1R antagonist exendin (9–39) completely blocked the neuroprotective effect of exenatide, indicating
that it is indeed GLP-1R speciﬁc. We recently demonstrated that
catalpol and other iridoid compounds, geniposide, geniposidic acid,
genipin methyl ether, 1,10-anhydrogenipin, loganin, shanzhiside
methylester, and 8-O-acetyl shanzhiside methylester, are orthosteric agonists of GLP-1Rs that function similarly in humans and rats
and presumably act at the same binding site as exendin (9–39), and
that catalpol produced antinociception in formalin-induced tonic
hyperalgesia in rats and the antinociceptive effect was blocked by
exendin (9–39) [30,41]. In the present study, we further demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of catalpol was completely
blocked by exendin (9–39), suggesting that catalpol, like exenatide,
produces neuroprotection via activation of GLP-1Rs in the central
nervous system.
As limited access of exenatide to the brain, and as the present
study was aimed to be a proof of principle of the GLP-1R/␤endorphin pathway rather than a test of anti-ischemic efﬁcacy, we
intraventricularly administered both exenatide and catalpol before
the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. However, extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated that, given systemically after

effects of exenatide and catalpol on ischemia reperfusion-induced brain infarction in
rats (a, b). Rats received two intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of control and
test articles 15 min before the occlusion of the middle artery followed by reperfusion
1 hour later. The second treatment was 15 min after the ﬁrst treatment. Two days
after reperfusion, the brain was removed for infarction staining. Data are presented
as means ± SEM (n = 6–8 in each group). a and b Denote the statistical signiﬁcance

ischemia was established, exenatide and particularly catalpol were
neuroprotective [21,26–28]. Catalpol is a small molecule iridoid
glycoside majorly from R. glutinosa Libosch and possess an excellent ability to cross the blood–brain barrier [42]. It was reported
that intraperitoneal injection of catalpol (1–10 mg/kg) immediately
after reperfusion and repeatedly at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h signiﬁcantly rescued neurons in hippocampal CA1 subﬁeld and reduced
working errors during behavioral testing in gerbils subjected to
transient global cerebral ischemia. Catalpol neuroprotection was
evident when it was applied 3 h post-ischemia, although its efﬁcacy became weak when it was given at 6 h afterward. Of great
encouragement was that catalpol neuroprotection could still be
seen in a long period of up to 35 days [27]. It was also reported
that catalpol (9 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally 24 h after
stroke and then daily for 3 days, signiﬁcantly facilitated neurological function recovery, reduced infarction volume, and increased
cerebral blood ﬂow in ischemic mice [28]. Taken together, all these
results support that the potential of systemic GLP-1R agonists in
preventing neuronal damage that occurs after ischemic insults.
GLP-1Rs are expressed in the cortex, neocortex, hypothalamus,
brainstem, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, and dorsal root

283

ganglia [2,7–12]. In the hippocampus, GLP-1Rs were reported to be
expressed in neurons, particularly pyramidal neurons [13,43,44].
GLP-1 receptor expression was increased one day after transient
cerebral ischemia in gerbils, and GLP-1R immunoreactivity was
found not only in pyramidal neurons, but also in astrocytes and
GABAergic interneurons [40]. We conﬁrmed the ischemia-induced
upregulation of GLP-1Rs in the hippocampus particularly in the
stratum lacunosum moleculare layer of the CA1 region. In addition, there is cumulative evidence indicating that microglia in the
hippocampus are proliferated and activated [36,37,45]. Our results
extended this observation by showing that microglial GLP-1Rs were
upgraded in addition to the proliferation and activation of microglia
following transient ischemia and reperfusion.
␤-Endorphin is an endogenous opioid peptide neurotransmitter
in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, particularly the
hypothalamus and pituitary gland, and it speciﬁcally activates the
opioid receptors located on neurons [46–48]. Our results demonstrated that exenatide and catalpol blocked ischemia-induced
cortical and subcortical infarction and stimulated ␤-endorphin
expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus. In addition, pretreatment with exenatide and catalpol concentration-dependently
stimulated ␤-endorphin release from primary cultures of hippocampal microglia but not neurons or astrocytes. Furthermore,
the speciﬁc ␤-endorphin antiserum and ␮-opioid receptor preferred antagonist naloxone almost completely reversed the
neuroprotective effects of exenatide and catalpol. The blockade
effect of naloxone is consistent with the previous ﬁndings that
activation of opioid receptors exerted its neuroprotective effects
in vitro and in vivo [49–52], although there is little literature of
␤-endorphin itself on neuroprotection. All of these results suggest that activation of hippocampal microglial GLP-1R expresses
␤-endorphin, which passes the microglial neuronal synapses and
stimulates the opioid receptors located on the neurons leading to
neuroprotection. However, the present study did not provide direct
in vivo evidence which showed in response to GLP-1R stimulation
with exenatide and catalpol, GLP-1R-expressing microglial cells in
the hippocampal region can speciﬁcally produce ␤-endorphin. Further studies are warranted to conﬁrm the ␤-endorphin origin of
hippocampal microglia by using more sensitive and speciﬁc in vivo
technologies, such as the radioactive in-situ hybridization in the
hippocampus, speciﬁc depletion of spinal microglia, and conditional knockout of microglial ␤-endorphin.
It is known that during episodes of hyperglycemia activation of
GLP-1R located on pancreas islet ␤-cells facilitates insulin release
to regulate blood sugar [53–57]. Given that activation of GLP-1Rs
expresses ␤-endorphin from microglia in the spinal dorsal horn
[2,24] and the hippocampus (the present study), we postulate that
in the central nervous system the activation of GLP-1Rs in microglia
stimulates ␤-endorphin expression to produce analgesia and neuroprotection.
