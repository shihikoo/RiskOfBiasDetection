Characteristics of cerebral ischemia in major rat stroke models of middle cerebral
artery ligation through craniectomy
Alexey Shmonin1,2, Elena Melnikova2, Michael Galagudza1,3*, and Timur Vlasov1,3
Background The refinement of experimental stroke models
is important for further development of neuroprotective
interventions.
Aims and/or hypothesis Our goal was to study the reproducibility of outcomes obtained in five rat models of middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation in order to identify the optimal
model for the preclinical studies.
Methods In Part 1 of the experiments, systolic blood flow
velocity (sBFV) and cerebral area at risk (AR) were determined
immediately after the onset of brain ischemia induced in different ways in Wistar rats. After that, another set of experiments was performed (Part 2 of the experiments), now aimed
at the assessment of the delayed outcome of five different
models of cerebral ischemia designated as Versions 1–5.
The versions were: Version 1 – 40-minute left MCA (LMCA)
occlusion with reperfusion; Version 2 – permanent LMCA ligation; Version 3 – permanent ligation of both LMCA and left
common carotid artery (CCA); Version 4 – permanent LMCA
and bilateral CCA (bCCA) ligation; Version 5 – permanent
LMCA ligation and 40-minute bCCA occlusion. The infarct size
(IS) was quantified using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The severity of neurological deficit was assessed by the
Garcia score. The extent of brain edema was determined by
calculating the difference in volumes of affected and contralateral hemispheres.
Results Within a relatively big AR, Versions 1 and 2 resulted in
a small IS [0·2 (0·0; 0·4)% and 0·3 (0·0; 0·7)%, respectively,
P > 0·05]. Unlike that and comparable with AR, Version 3
resulted in a greater, albeit more variable IS [5·9 (2·1; 8·3)%,
P < 0·0001 vs. Version 2]. Also comparable with AR, Versions 4
and 5 produced greatest values of IS [14·5 (11·4; 17·9)% and
11·3 (10·1; 14·2)%, respectively]; this parameter was most
reproducible in Version 5. A significant decrease in neurological deficit score was found in Versions 4 and 5. Again, the
reproducibility of the data on neurological outcome was
higher in Version 5 versus Version 4.
Conclusions Comparative analysis of several Versions of focal
cerebral ischemia within a single study might be helpful in
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and aftermath of stroke. Permanent LMCA ligation
plus transient bilateral CCA occlusion produced most consistent results and might be recommended for preclinical studies.

Introduction
Stroke is a major health problem in the industrialized countries.
In the United States, over 795 000 people experience either new
or recurrent stroke annually, which accounts for 16·7% of cardiovascular mortality (1). This statistics implies an urgent need
in the development of the therapies superior to those available,
for which animal experiments using different types of focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) would be of primary significance. Among
different animal species, rats are most commonly used in preclinical neuroprotection studies (2). Two main FCI models are
currently recognized, including intraluminal middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion via a filament implantation, and MCA
ligation through craniectomy. The filament implantation model
described initially by Koizumi et al. (3) and further improved by
Longa et al. (4) has serious limitation, that is, the dependence of
the MCA occlusion effectiveness on filament diameter and on
the precision of its positioning, which is unattainable without
monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow (5). Moreover, the
model is not reliable when used for induction of ischemia
without reperfusion and, in any setup, for the experiments on
aged animals due to the age-related anatomical changes interfering with the filament passage. Contrary to that, the direct
MCA occlusion model, either transient or permanent, while
being more invasive, is free of these limitations and, when transient, may be used in the experiments simulating cerebral reperfusion via thrombolysis and/or ischemic conditioning.
Currently, at least five modifications of MCA occlusion model
are used in the experimental studies of stroke. They include
reversible (6) and irreversible (7) isolated MCA occlusion,
simultaneous ligation of MCA and ipsilateral common carotid
artery (CCA) (8), and MCA ligation accompanied by either
permanent (9) or transient (10) bilateral CCA (bCCA)
occlusion.

Aims
It is known that one of the main problems of rodent models
of FCI is significant variability of the results, which can be
reduced by combining various outcome measures. The primary
objective of the present work was to study the reproducibility of
outcomes obtained in five rat models of MCA ligation as well as
the relationship between the reduction of blood flow, perfusion
deficit area, infarct volume, and neurological deficit. Such
an analysis of data had never been applied to the studies of
experimental stroke previously. The overall objective of
the study was to streamline the methodology and to identify
the optimal ischemia protocol for highest consistency in
outcomes.

Methods
Animals
All experiments were performed on male Wistar rats weighting
250–300 g. The animals were fed regular chow, and water was
available ad libitum. The procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the local Ethics Committee. The animals were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate given intraperitoneally at a dose
of 550 mg/kg. Core body temperature was maintained at
37·0 ⫾ 0·5°C by a feedback-controlled heating pad (TCAT–2LV
controller, PHYSITEMP Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ).
Study design
In the present study, we first focused attention on the determination of systolic blood flow velocity (sBFV) and potential cerebral
area at risk (AR) immediately after different procedures with the
arteries involved in blood supply to the brain (Part 1 of the
experimental series). After that, another set of experiments was
performed, now aimed at the assessment of the delayed outcome
of these manipulations (Part 2 of the experimental series). In
these experiments, infarct size (IS), brain edema, and neurological
deficits were determined in five versions of FCI 48 hours after the
onset of ischemia.
Part 1 of the experimental series
To secure access to left MCA (LMCA), the inverse V-shaped scalp
incision was done at the area between the left ear and the left eye,
with the base of the skin flap located at the level of the left upper
eyelid. After partial excision of the temporalis muscle, three burr
holes of 1·5 mm in diameter were drilled through the squamosal
bone at the upper caudal angle of the surgical field. Craniectomy
between the holes was done, followed by incision of dura mater
for visual inspection of LMCA. Under microscopic control, the
distal LMCA was ligated with atraumatic prolene suture (Ethicon,
7–0, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) above the rhinal
fissure. Noteworthy, we preferred the LMCA ligation instead of
cauterization since, according to our pilot experiments, the latter
technique might inflict undesirable thermal damage.
CCAs were accessed through ventral midline cervical incision
followed by blunt dissection of sternohyoid and sternomastoid
muscles. Then, either left CCA (LCCA) or both arteries underwent occlusion.
A single measurement of sBFV was done in the LMCA immediately following the arterial occlusion or sham procedure in the
following groups:

•

Sham (n = 13) – LMCA was surgically exposed without
ligation
• LMCAO (n = 17) – isolated LMCA occlusion
• LCCAO (n = 9) – LCCA occlusion
• bCCAO (n = 17) – bilateral CCA occlusion
• LMCAO + LCCAO (n = 12) – occlusion of LMCA plus
LCCA
• LMCAO + bCCAO (n = 15) – occlusion of LMCA and both
CCAs.
The AR was determined immediately after arterial ligation in
the following groups of animals:

•

LMCAO (n = 6) – isolated LMCA occlusion

A. Shmonin et al.

• LMCAO + LCCAO (n = 7) – occlusion of both LMCA and
LCCA
• LMCAO + bCCAO (n = 7) – occlusion of LMCA and both
CCAs.
Determination of systolic blood flow velocity
Arterial blood flow was registered in the LMCA after craniectomy
using the high–frequency ultrasound Doppler flowmetry
(Minimax, Ltd., St. Petersburg, Russian Federation). sBFV was
measured using 20 MHz probe positioned onto the wall of the
artery and expressed in cm/s.
Determination of area at risk
In each case, the region of tissue with severe blood flow reduction
due to arterial ligation(s) was referred to as the AR. In the present
study, we used the technique of AR delineation with Evans blue, a
method used previously for AR registration in the heart (11) and
subsequently adopted for AR determination in the brain (12).
Briefly, immediately after induction of cerebral ischemia 1 ml of
5% Evans blue was injected into the left ventricular cavity. Five
seconds after that, the animals were euthanized, the brain was cut
into five 3 mm-thick frontal slices, each photographed, digitized,
and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CS. The AR volumes were
calculated by multiplication of Evans blue–negative area by slice
thickness. The AR volume of the whole brain was calculated by
summarizing the AR volumes of the slices to be finally expressed
as a percentage of AR to the total brain volume.
Part 2 of the experimental series
The animals were randomly allocated to the following experimental groups (Fig. 1):

• Version 1 (n = 6) – LMCA occlusion for 40 minutes followed by reperfusion. For that, LMCA was cautiously pulled
up with the thread for 40 minutes to abrogate blood flow
followed by the release of the thread resulting in the microscopically controlled blood flow reinstitution
• Version 2 (n = 6) – permanent LMCA ligation without
reperfusion
• Version 3 (n = 13) – permanent ligation of both LMCA and
LCCA
• Version 4 (n = 13) – permanent LMCA and bCCA ligation
• Version 5 (n = 8) – permanent LMCA ligation and
40–minute bCCA occlusion followed by reperfusion. Temporal occlusion of CCAs was achieved by reversible microvascular clip fixation on the artery.
Sham-treated animals (n = 5) were subjected to similar surgical
procedures with the exception of cerebral artery(ies) ligation. At
the end of each procedure, the wounds were closed. Forty-eight
hours after that, the neurological evaluation was performed and
the animals were sacrificed for histochemical determination of IS
and measurement of brain edema; the outcomes were determined
by an investigator blinded to the group assignments.
Measurement of mean arterial pressure
The right femoral artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP values were registered
at baseline, prior to arterial occlusion(s), 20 and 40 minutes after
LMCA ligation, and one hour after LMCA ligation in Versions

Fig. 1 Schematic and visual presentation of the experimental protocol. (a) Schematic presentation. The animals were allocated to five groups (Versions),
each subjected to distinct ways of focal cerebral ischemia. Briefly, Version 1 (LMCA–O/R, n = 6): 40 minutes of LMCA occlusion followed by reperfusion;
Version 2 (LMCA–PL, n = 6): permanent ligation of LMCA; Version 3 ((LMCA + LCCA)–PL, n = 13): permanent ligation of both LMCA and LCCA; Version
4 ((LMCA + bCCA)–PL, n = 13): simultaneous permanent ligation of LMCA and both CCAs; Version 5 (LMCA–PL + bCCA–O/R, n = 8): permanent ligation
of LMCA plus 40-minute bilateral occlusion of CCAs. (b) Visual presentation. For detail, see Materials and Methods.

2–5. In Version 1, MAP values were registered in the same time
points with the last measurement done 20 minutes after LMCA
reperfusion.
Neurological tests
Examination of neurological status was performed according to
Garcia et al. (13), with six tests applied and the degree of injury
scored from 18 (no deficit at all) to 3 (the most severe deficit).
Determination of infarct size
IS was determined after incubation of the brain slices in 0·1%
2·3.5–triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, MP Biomed., St.
Louis, MO) at 37°C (pH 7·4) for 15 minutes followed by taking
photographs, digitizing, and calculation of infarct volume as
discussed earlier (for detail, see section ‘Determination of area at
risk’). After correction for edema, IS was expressed as a percentage
of infarct volume to that of the total brain.
Evaluation of brain edema
The extent of brain edema was calculated using the formula (14):
[volume of ischemic hemisphere–volume of contralateral
hemisphere]/volume of contralateral hemisphere ¥ 100.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with use of SPSS 12·0 software
package. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine differences in outcomes, followed by pairwise inter-group comparisons performed using non–parametric Mann–Whitney U-test.

p values ⱕ 0·05 were considered significant. All data in the text
were expressed as ‘median (25 quartile; 75 quartile)’. Neurological
scores were presented as box plots with median and quartiles as
well as whiskers to express minimum and maximum values.

Results
Mortality
At the end of the study, results could be obtained from 138 of 149
rats (92·6%). The mortality rates, therefore, were 0/6, 0/6, 3/13,
6/13, and 2/8 in Versions 1–5, respectively.
Part 1 of the experimental series
Systolic blood flow velocity
As presented in Fig. 2, sBFV in sham-operated animals differed
significantly between the individual experiments and averaged
42·0 (31·0; 57·1) cm/s. Also, LMCA ligation resulted in significant
reduction of blood flow [10·2 (7·1; 13·2) cm/s, P < 0·0001 vs.
baseline]. Unlike the LMCA, the ligation of LCCA caused only an
insignificant decrease in sBFV [31·4 (18·1; 41·0) cm/s, P = 0·071
vs. baseline]. bCCA ligation resulted in a dramatic decrease in
sBFV [9·0 (6·3; 12·0) cm/s, P < 0·0001 vs. baseline, Fig. 2a]. In the
group with ligation of LMCA plus LCCA the reduction in sBFV
was higher, that is, 6·1 (3·0; 9·0) cm/s (P < 0·05 vs. bCCA ligation).
The lowest sBFV in the LMCA was observed when LMCA ligation

was accompanied by bCCA occlusion [3·0 (2·1; 4·0) cm/s,
P < 0·05 vs. ligation of LMCA and LCCA].
Area at risk
As to the AR (Fig. 3), the ligation of LMCA alone resulted in its
value of 4·7 (3·8; 6·0)%. The ligation of LMCA and LCCA resulted
in a somewhat greater AR [7·6 (4·8; 11·4)%], although the difference between this and the previous group was not significant
(P = 0·1). LMCA and bCCA ligation was accompanied with a
significantly greater AR [15·6 (12·8; 17·0)%, P < 0·01 vs. both
isolated LMCA ligation and LMCA plus LCCA ligation].

Neurological status
The data on neurological deficit after induction of ischemia are
presented in Fig. 4. In sham-operated animals, neurological
deficit score averaged 17·1 (16·3; 18·0). In Versions 1–3, the score
was not different from that in sham-treated animals [17·2 (16·1;
18·3), 17·1 (16·4; 17·9), 16·0 (15·7; 17·5), respectively, P = 0·94,
0·95, 0·41 vs. shams, respectively]. The greatest deficit was
observed after permanent ligation of LMCA plus both CCAs
(Version 4) [11·4 (8·5; 13·6), P = 0·002 vs. shams]. The same was
true for Version 5 (permanent LMCA ligation plus reversible
bCCA occlusion) – [14·2 (12·5; 14·4), P = 0·139 vs. Version 4],
although the reproducibility was higher in the last of the versions.
Infarct size
No infarction was detected in sham-operated rats. All of the versions were aimed at and resulted in the development of neocortical infarction (Fig. 5). A 40-minute LMCA occlusion followed

in Version 4 [11·3 (10·1; 14·2)%, P = 0·2 vs. Version 4]. Notably,
in Version 5, IS was less variable in comparison with Versions 3
and 4.
Brain edema
There was no cerebral edema in sham-operated rats (data not
shown), Versions 1 and 2 (Fig. 6). Permanent occlusion of both
LMCA and LCCA (Version 3) resulted in an appreciable edema
[8·2 (6·0; 12·1), P = 0·003 vs. this parameter in Version 2], whereas
permanent ligation of LMCA plus both CCAs (Version 4) as well
as permanent ligation of LMCA along with 40-minute bilateral
occlusion of CCAs (Version 5) both resulted in edema roughly
equal to that in Version 3 [12·0 (4·2; 16·0) and 8·6 (3·9; 14·9),
respectively; P = 0·017 and 0·014 vs. Version 2, respectively].

Discussion
Five generally accepted modifications of rat stroke model with
transcranial MCA ligation were described previously (6–10). In
the present work, all five models (Versions 1–5) were utilized
within a single study to ensure a more precise comparative evaluation of distinct patterns of individual models of brain infarction.

by reperfusion (Version 1) caused a relatively small IS [0·2 (0·0;
0·4)%]. Permanent LMCA ligation (Version 2) was not different
significantly from Version 1 by both IS and its variability [0·3 (0·0;
0·7)%, P = 0·93 vs. Version 1]. Simultaneous permanent ligation
of LMCA and LCCA (Version 3) resulted in significantly greater
IS, that is, 5·9 (2·1; 8·3)%, P < 0·0001 vs. Versions 1 and 2. The
greatest IS was observed after permanent ligation of LMCA plus
both CCAs in Version 4 [14·6 (11·4; 17·9)%, P = 0·019 vs. Version
3]. Unlike Versions 1–3, a significant variability in IS was observed
in Version 4. In Version 5 (permanent ligation of LCMA along
with transient bCCA occlusion), although both CCAs were
occluded for 40 minutes only, the IS was essentially the same as

Systolic blood flow velocity
This parameter varied significantly depending on the procedure
applied based on the results of high-frequency Doppler ultrasound flowmetry. Thus, unilateral CCA ligation did not cause
significant reduction in sBFV consistent with the data of Herz
et al. (15), likely due to the contribution of blood flow through
the collateral vessels at the base of the brain. Notably, the inhomogeneity in the sBFV (Fig. 2b) might be explained by natural
variability in the number and/or caliber of collateral vessels that
supply the affected area. Unlike that, a significant and more
homogenous sBFV reduction after bCCA ligation could be
explained by a cessation of the collateral blood supply from the
circle of Willis, which might have been compensated by the unaltered blood supply to the affected area from vertebral circulation
through the system of leptomeningeal anastomoses. Furthermore, although either LMCA ligation alone or together with unior bilateral CCA ligation both resulted in a dramatic reduction of
sBFV, the variability of the effects was different due to the variability in the collateral blood supply discussed above (Fig. 2b),
along with the anatomical characteristics of collaterals, sBFV
value after arterial occlusion might be influenced by the perfusion
pressure. Since MAP was not measured in the Part 1 of the experiments, we can not rule out the possibility that the observed variability in sBVF and AR size might be at least partially explained by
the differences in blood pressure.
Area at risk and infarct size
Two distinct approaches to registration of cerebral response to
ischemia were used in the present study: immediate labeling for
evaluation of AR size (Part 1) as related to the ultimate infarctproducing effect of different manipulations on the artery(ies)
(Part 2; Versions 1–5). That the IS was significantly smaller than
mean AR in the animals subjected to isolated LMCA ligation [0·3

obtained in Part 1, respectively], can be explained by the extensive
collateralization of the LMCA territory leading to minimization
of irreversible injury. In contrast, IS and AR size did not differ
statistically either after both LMCA and LCCA occlusion [5·9 (2·1;
8·3)% for Version 3 and 7·6 (4·8; 11·4)% for the results obtained
in Part 1, respectively, P = 0·165] or in the animals with simultaneous occlusion of LMCA and both CCAs [14·5 (11·4; 17·9)% for
Version 4 and 15·6 (12·8; 17·0)% for the results obtained in Part 1,
respectively, P = 0·372]. It appears, therefore, that the results
obtained in the two latter groups of Part 1 favor the idea that the
AR size remained practically unchanged during the 48-h observation period (Versions 3, 4) due to absence or insufficient
collateralization. Supportive of this idea might be recent experimental and clinical data on the extent of cerebral tissue collateralization after arterial occlusion in stroke as the major predictor of
final IS (16,17).
Reduction of cerebral IS is considered to be a ‘gold standard’ for
the preclinical studies of neuroprotective interventions, and
reproducibility of infarct parameters should be of crucial importance in the relevant experimental settings. Consistent with the
histochemical findings obtained by the others, IS, along with
other factors, is dependent on time interval after induction of
ischemia (18). We chose 48 h as an optimal period for determination of infarct parameters. Concerning evaluation of our

798

present results, the ligation of LMCA alone (Version 2) resulted in
a relatively small infarction, which is in accord with the results of
prototype trials using the same model (19,20). Moreover, in some
cases the authors found no infarction at all, although in more
technically refined experiments such cases were a rarity (20). A
considerable inter-animal variability in IS was documented in the
previously mentioned experiments as well as in Versions 3 (ligation of LMCA plus LCCA) and 4 (ligation of LMCA plus both
CCAs) of our study. The major source of IS variability most likely
would be a significant animal-to-animal difference in the development of vasculature and therefore collateral local blood supply
of the affected brain area from vertebrobasilar system through
leptomeningeal anastomoses. A robust support of this idea comes
from our results obtained under the conditions that anatomically
exclude the probability of collateralization: LMCA ligation
accompanied by temporal (40 minute) bCCA occlusion makes
the IS variability very low (Version 5). In line with our observations, the opening of leptomeningeal anastomoses was reported
to begin not immediately but following 40 or more minutes after
bCCA occlusion (21). The models of reversible FCI are also of
interest because of their relevance to the routine clinical approach
of cerebral reperfusion via thrombolysis. In the present study, two
experimental protocols of reversible cerebral ischemia were used,
that is, Versions 1 (40-minute LMCA occlusion) and 5 (perma© 2012 The Authors.

only partial reperfusion, respectively. Clearly, the former
approach should rescue some brain tissue, although blood flow
restoration could cause an additional injury (for review, see Reza
Noorian et al. (22) and the references therein). The lack of neuroprotective effect of reperfusion in Version 1 might account for
by prolonged ischemia and/or the progressive irreversible reperfusion injury overrunning the benefits of revascularization.
Based on our morphological data, it seems justified to determine first the initial AR (Part 1) followed by the sets of experiments designated as Part 2 (Versions 1–5). Furthermore, the

producing neocortical infarction. Next, the permanent ligation of
LMCA and both CCAs (Version 4), which also caused generally
similar effects, resulted in a significantly greater variability in all
the parameters studied, as well as in greater mortality. Furthermore, the results obtained after either permanent or temporal
LMCA occlusion (Versions 1 and 2, respectively) are of special
interest because both were characterized by relatively small infarction with significant variability in its size without substantial
complications, such as edema and neurological deficit. That, at
least in part, might be accounted for by the individual variability
in the efficiency of the collateral blood flow. A considerable variVol 9, August 2014, 793–801

ability of IS after a partial blockage of collateral blood supply
(Version 3), despite a significantly greater brain injury, also lends
support to this notion. Although MAP values were not statistically
different within and between groups in Part 2 of the experiments,
the baseline MAP values were slightly different among the
Versions. These differences in MAP should be considered as one
of the factors contributing to the observed variability in regional
cerebral blood flow, AR, and IS.
Neurological outcome
In addition to cerebral IS, evaluation of neurological outcome is
commonly considered to be a useful complementary end point of
cerebral protection against ischemia. As in many similar studies
(e.g., (23)), our experiments established a direct correlation
between neurological deficits and infarct volume with a single
exception. The exception was Version 3 (permanent ligation of
both LMCA and LCCA) in which neurological deficit was not
different from sham-operated animals despite significantly
greater IS vs. Versions 1 and 2. In this particular case, the lack of
the above-mentioned correlation might be explained by IS variability, which proved to be unpredictably higher compared to that
of neurological deficit (Fig. 5a cf. Fig. 4). The lack of such a correlation was also noted in the experiments using certain neuroprotective agents (24,25), probably reflecting the selective
beneficial effect of these particular drugs on functional rather
than morphological manifestation of cerebral injury.
Utility of stroke models for the preclinical testing of
neuroprotective agents
Rodent stroke models are increasingly used for testing of novel
neuroprotective therapies. Although more then 1000 distinct
therapies were shown to be neuroprotective in the preclinical
studies, the results of clinical trials have been largely disappointing (26). In an attempt to facilitate translation of novel drug
candidates to clinical settings, the Stroke Therapy Academic
Industry Roundtable (STAIR) group elaborated (27) and recently
updated (28) the criteria needed to be met in order to improve the
quality of experimental studies on neuroprotection. Unfortunately, a systematic review by O’Collins et al. (29) showed in 2006
that only 5 out of 550 drugs with experimentally proven

neuroprotective effect(s) fully met the STAIR criteria. It should be
noted that some of STAIR criteria specify the protocol of drug
administration and underline the importance of dose–response
curves, while the others deal with the characteristics of experimental model and study end-points. It is suggested that the rat
models of permanent MCA ligation through craniectomy could
be useful tools in identifying the efficacy of novel neuroprotectants, at least for the screening stage (30). Randomization of
the animals and blinded assessment of both histological and functional outcomes might further improve quality of preclinical neuroprotection studies. Better reproducibility of the outcomes,
observed in the present study in Version 5 (permanent LMCA
ligation with 40-minute bCCA occlusion), strongly contributes to
a lower variance resulting in a lesser numbers of animals per
group needed to obtain the statistically significant results.
Study limitations
The present study has several methodological limitations. First,
both AR size and sBFV were determined at a single time point just
after the induction of cerebral ischemia in the special series of
acute experiments. It would be more informative to analyze the
time course of changes in both cerebral blood flow and perfusion
deficit area throughout the entire occlusion period, rather than
looking at a cross-sectional picture of the parameters measured.
Technically, this goal might be accomplished using neuroimaging
modalities, such as diffusion/perfusion MRI scanning (31).
Second, the neurological deficit scoring system applied is becoming increasingly criticized for its relative failure to test the disorders of rodent species-specific reflexes and, consequently,
insufficient sensitivity in determining functional outcomes.
Therefore, the development and validation of new species-specific
neurological deficit scoring systems is warranted. Third, the
extent of brain swelling was determined indirectly by calculating
the difference in volumes of affected and contralateral hemispheres instead of using wet-dry cerebral weight measurements.
However, the former approach might be more advantageous in
the sense that it does not preclude IS determination, thereby
avoiding the necessity of increasing the number of animals used.

sured in all experiments but only in the pilot ones. These measurements showed that both blood gases and glycemia were
maintained within normal range during the entire experiment.
Lastly, functional and morphological outcomes of cerebral
ischemia were determined only at 48 hours after reperfusion.
According to STAIR recommendations, the outcomes should be
also assessed at 2–3 weeks after the onset of ischemia. Future
studies will address these important issues.

Conclusions
Investigation of several patterns of FCI within a single study
would provide further insight in both technical details of the
procedures applied and in the understanding the mechanisms
underlying experimental stroke. The model of permanent LMCA
ligation accompanied by reversible bCCA occlusion was shown to
be optimal in terms of both lesion size and reproducibility of
outcomes. The use of reliable and reproducible models of FCI
could potentially contribute to better translation of novel neuroprotective strategies to the clinical arena.
