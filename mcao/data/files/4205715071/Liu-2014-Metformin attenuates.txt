Abstract
Background: Metformin, a widely used hypoglycemic drug, reduces stroke incidence and alleviates chronic
inflammation in clinical trials. However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated
the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms.
Methods: Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct
volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated
following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of
metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways.
Results: Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO
(P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+
cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition,
metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-κB activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α)
and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and
alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective
AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect.
Conclusions: Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent
ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic
agent in stroke therapy.

Background
Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death
worldwide [1]. Due to its high disability, it is also a big
burden on our society. So far, the only Food and Drugs
Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment
of ischemic stroke is rtPA, which improves clinical outcomes if administrated within 4.5 hours after the stroke

onset. However, due to its narrow therapeutic window,
less than 5% of patients benefit from it [2]. Therefore,
developing effective drugs to treat ischemic stroke is an
important task.
Metformin is a drug widely prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic syndromes
since 1960s [3]. Through activating AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), metformin inhibits hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral glucose utilization, which
effectively controls blood glucose level [4]. However, its
ability is not limited to lowering glucose. The benefits of
metformin have been demonstrated in clinical trials.

death [5]. Metformin also reduces intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule1 (VCAM-1) levels in plasma and alleviates chronic inflammation in patients [6]. Nevertheless, these effects were
independent of its glycemic management properties, suggesting that metformin may have other functions through
mechanisms other than glucose reduction. AMPK is a trimetric enzyme comprising a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits [7]. An alteration in AMP/ATP
ratio activates AMPK and promotes AMPK phosphorylation at a threonine residue (Thr-172) [3]. A series of
pathological conditions such as glucose deprivation, ischemia, starvation and oxidative stress increase AMPK activity [8]. Agents such as resveratrol and adiponectin can
also activate AMPK. AMPK activation is a protective reaction that occurs after injury. AMPK activated by metformin showed to reduce endothelial cell apoptosis and
diminish cardiomyocyte death [9,10]. It has been demonstrated that increasing AMPK activity in neurons protects
neurons from various injuries [11]. In addition, metformin
reduced TNF-α-induced inflammation via activation of
AMPK in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) [12]. It has been
indicated that AMPK activation in cells in the immune
system promotes the switch from a pro-inflammatory to
an anti-inflammatory phenotype [13]. Thus, metformin
could be a promising anti-inflammatory agent.
ICAM-1 is expressed on many cell types including ECs
and lymphocytes [14]. ICAM-1 is expressed constitutively
on ECs at low level and its expression is significantly increased in hypoxic condition [15]. ICAM-1 expressed on
ECs facilitates neutrophil adhesion and tissue infiltration,
which play critical roles in the progress of ischemic stroke
[16,17]. Infiltrated leukocytes induce a secondary injury
after reperfusion by producing detrimental substances that
damage brain cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) [18,19]. BBB disruption after ischemia increases
brain edema and exacerbates ischemic injury [14]. Since
ICAM-1 plays a vital role in neutrophil infiltration and
cerebral injury after reperfusion, it is a promising target in
the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Studies have illustrated that metformin provides cardioprotection against myocardial infarction [4]. However,
the function of metformin in inflammation after ischemic stroke is unknown. In our research, we explored
whether metformin could reduce ischemic brain injury
using a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) model, and attempted to define the underlying
mechanism of metformin.

divided into two groups that either underwent metformin
or saline treatment. At 1 and 3 days after tMCAO, mice
were sacrificed and samples were collected for further
study. Metformin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 30 mg/ml and
200 mg/kg was administered intra-peritoneally immediately
after reperfusion and then administered daily until the animals were sacrificed. An equal volume of saline was used
for the control group. The dose was chosen according to a
previous study [20]. The whole experimental design and
the number of animal used are displayed in Figure 1.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
in mice

tMCAO was carried out as previously described [21].
Adult CD1 mice weighing 30 ± 5 grams were anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg/kg; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) through intra-peritoneal injection. After
isolation of the left common carotid artery, the external
carotid artery (ECA) and the internal carotid artery (ICA),
a silicone-coated 6-0 suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA,
USA) was gently inserted into the ICA and stopped at the
opening of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Successful
occlusion was ascertained by a decrease of surface cerebral
blood flow to 10% of baseline using a laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK). Reperfusion was
performed 90 minutes after tMCAO with suture withdrawal. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure except for the insertion of the suture into the ICA.
The mortality in our study was less than 5%.
Infarct volume measurement

Infarct volume was measured using cresyl violet (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) staining as previously described [22].
The ischemic area of each section was depicted by image

analysis software (Image J, NIH, MD, USA). Infarct
volume was calculated as described in our previous
study [23].
Neurobehavioral assessments

Neurobehavioral assessments were conducted by an experimenter who was blind to the treatment conditions.
The rotarod test was used to evaluate the motor and balance functions of the mice. The mice were trained to
stay on an accelerating rotating cylinder for 3 days before tMCAO, and time remained on the rotating rod
was recorded before surgery and at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days
after surgery. The velocity was increased slowly from 4 to
40 rpm within 2 minutes. For each test, every animal was
tested three times, and the average time maintained on
the rod was recorded. For neurological function assessment, a modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS)
ranging from 0 to 14 score was adopted, which included
raising the mouse by the tail (0 to 3), walking on the floor
(0 to 3), beam balance tests (0 to 6), and the relaxes absence (0 to 2) [22].
Immunostaining

Double staining: ZO-1/CD31, occludin/CD31 or claudin5/CD31 double staining was conducted as previously described [23]. Briefly, brain sections were blocked with 10%
FBS for 1 hour and then incubated with ZO-1 (1:100 dilution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and CD31 (1:200 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA); occludin
(1:100 dilution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
CD31; claudin-5 (1:100 dilution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and CD31 at 4°C overnight. After washing, brain
sections were incubated with the appropriate second antibodies for 1 hour. Brain sections were examined using a
confocal microscope (Leica, Solms, Germany) and photographs were taken for further analysis.
DAB staining: for myeloperoxidase (MPO), ICAM-1 and
Gr1 (Ly 6G) immunostaining, brain sections were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 minutes. After
blocking with FBS, the primary anti-body MPO (1:300 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and ICAM-1
(1:200 dilution, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA),
Gr1 (1:100 dilution, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) were
incubated overnight at 4°C. Sections were incubated with
biotinylated-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and then incubated with
Vectastain ABC Reagent. The reaction product was visualized using a DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Eight interested fields in each
ipsilateral hemisphere, including the perifocal region in
both cortex and striatum, were photographed in each
section and five consecutive sections spaced at 200 μm
were counted in each mouse. MPO+ and Gr1+ (Ly 6G)
cells were counted in each field by a person blinded to

the treatment group. IgG leakage was examined as previously reported and the procedure was similar to MPO
staining except for the primary antibody incubating
process [23]. Four areas of ischemic penumbra from
each slide were photographed. And mean optical density was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Western blot analysis

Samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) supplemented with
1 mmol/L PMSF (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA), cocktail
(Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor
(Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). For Western blot analyses, samples containing the same amount of proteins
were loaded onto the resolving gel (Promoton, Shanghai,
China) for electrophoresis after denaturing. Proteins were
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). After being blocked with 5% non-fat
milk, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies
at the following dilution MPO (1:500), ICAM-1 (1:2,000),
ZO-1 (1:500), occludin (1:500), claudin-5 (1:500), p-AMPK
(1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA),
AMPK (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA), p-NF-κB (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), NF-κB (1:1,000, Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), β-actin (1:1,000, Santa
Cruz Technology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4°C overnight,
respectively. After washing, the membrane was incubated
with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour and then reacted with
enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA). The results were recorded by Quantity One
image software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and relative
intensity was calculated using Gel-Pro Analyzer software
(Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).
MPO activity assay

MPO activity assay was performed as described previously
[23]. In brief, brain protein (10 μL) from ipsilateral hemisphere was added to 180 μL of work solution, which contained 2 mmol/L O-dianisidin-dihydrochloride (Sigma)
dissolved in 180 μl of 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH =6). Before measurement, 10 μL of 100 mmol/L
H2O2 was added. Changes in absorbance at 460 nm over
10 minutes were measured. MPO activity was expressed
as U/mg tissue, and 1U of MPO activity represents the
amount of enzyme degrading 1 μmol H2O2 per minute
at 25°C.
Real-Time PCR

Total RNA from the ischemic hemisphere was extracted
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and dissolved in 60 μL RNA free water according to the

Liu et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:177

manufacturer’s instructions. A universal 2-step RT-PCR
cycling condition was used: 95°C for 30 seconds followed
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds. mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous
control, GAPDH expression, and were calculated using
fold change relative to the saline control group [23].
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) analysis

Protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were quantified
using an ELISA kit (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded and the concentration
of the target protein was read according to the standard
curve. Result was expressed as pg/mg protein.
Evans blue extravasation

Evans blue extravasation was measured as previously described. In brief, 3 days after tMCAO, 4 ml/kg of 2% Evans
blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline was administered intraperitoneally. After 2 hours circulation, mice were
anesthetized and perfused with saline through the left ventricle until colorless fluid outflowed from the right atrium.
Then, ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were collected after decapitated. Each hemisphere was weighed
rapidly, homogenized in 1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid
(wt/vol). After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 minutes),
supernatant was collected and mixed with ethanol (1:3).
The concentration of Evans blue was determined by measuring the 610 nm absorbance and tissue content of Evans
blue was quantified from a linear standard curve and
expressed in terms of Evans blue (μg)/tissue (g).
Oxygen glucose deprivation

bEND.3 was purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and cultured in DMEM (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with
10% FBS. Ischemia-like conditions in vitro were induced
by oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion-like conditions in vitro were induced by reoxygenation. After
cells reached a 90% confluence, the medium was replaced
with DMEM without glucose. Then, cultures were transferred to an anaerobic chamber infused with a gas mixture
containing 5% CO2, 95% N2. After incubating for 6 hours,
cells were further cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS under normal conditions for another 24 hours
with or without metformin. p-AMPK analysis in bEND.3
cells was determined 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours after
6 hours oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). The dose used
was 10 mM, which was chosen according to previous reports [20]. Compound C (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), a
selective AMPK inhibitor was added to the medium at a
final concentration of 10 μmol/L before OGD treatment
and maintained throughout the whole experiment [24].
An equal volume of PBS was used in the control group.

Statistical analysis

Results were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis
was evaluated by Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA, USA). For comparison between the two
groups, statistical significance was determined through a
Student's t test. For comparison among multiple groups,
statistical significance was evaluated using one-way ANOVA
followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls test. A probability
value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Metformin reduced infarct volume and improved
neurobehavioral outcomes

We found that after metformin treatment, infarct volume
was reduced at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO (Figure 2A-B).
To further explore the function of metformin, we used
mNSS to examine the motor, balance and reflex functions
of mice after tMCAO. We showed that mice had
significantly lower scores after 3 days in the metformintreated group after tMCAO for at least 14 days
(Figure 2C). A similar result was obtained from the
rotarod test (Figure 2D). To investigate whether metformin influenced glucose levels after tMCAO, fasting
blood-glucose (FBG) was tested before, 3 days and
14 days after tMCAO, indicating metformin did not
influence FBG level, blood gas or body weight after
both 3 (Table 1) days and 14 days treatment (Data
were shown in Additional file 1: Table S1)
Metformin alleviated neutrophil infiltration and IL-1β,
IL-6, TNF-α expression

To investigate the effect of metformin on neutrophil infiltration in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, we
performed 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining to detect MPO+ cells. Results showed MPO+ cells were almost undetectable in the sham group, and there was a
decrease in MPO+ cells at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO in
the metformin-treated group compared to the control
group (Figure 3D). Western blot analysis indicated that
MPO were reduced in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.01,
Figure 3E). MPO activity is an indicator of inflammation
and could be used to evaluate neutrophil accumulation
[23]. MPO activity was attenuated in the metformintreated group compared to the control group (P < 0.05,
Figure 3C). In addition, we used another neutrophil
marker Gr1 (Ly 6G) to evaluate neutrophil infiltration
after cerebral ischemia. Results showed that metformin reduced Gr1 positive cells effectively at 1 day and 3 days
after tMCAO (Additional file 2: Figure S1, P < 0.01). We
further used RT-PCR and ELISA to evaluate changes in
inflammation-related cytokine expression in mRNA and
protein levels. Metformin reduced IL-β, IL-6, TNF-α
mRNA at 1 day after tMCAO. Although there was a
downward tendency in IL-6 mRNA, only changes in IL-β,

group compared to the control group at 3 days after
tMCAO (Figure 3A). There was a decrease of IL-β, IL-6,
TNF-α expression at 3 days after tMCAO in protein level
(Figure 3B, P < 0.01).

Metformin reduced BBB disruption

To evaluate endothelial cell permeability after metformin
treatment, we conducted occludin/CD31, ZO-1/CD31 and
claudin-5/CD31 double staining to observe tight junction
distribution in situ at 3 days after tMCAO. Result indicated that occludin and ZO-1 were continuously located
on the margin of ECs in sham group, claudin-5 was continuously located along ECs, and fewer gaps were formed
in the metformin-treated group (Figure 4A). Gap formation and rearrangement were used to evaluate tight junction disruption after injury. To evaluate tight junction
rearrangement, Western blot was adopted and we found
that metformin-treated mice demonstrated occludin, ZO1 and claudin-5 hyper-expression (Figure 4B). In addition,
we performed IgG immunostaining and Evans blue extravasation to evaluate endothelial permeability and found
that there was significantly reduced IgG and Evans blue
leakage at 3 days after tMCAO in metformin-treated mice
(Figure 4C-D).
Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 expression via AMPK
signaling pathway

To assess the phosphorylation status of AMPK at threonine
residue, Western blot was used. We demonstrated that
ischemia-reperfusion increased AMPK phosphorylation
and this induction was increased after metformin treatment
(Figure 5A). To further explore mechanisms of metformin
in neuroprotection, we analyzed ICAM-1 expression after

tMCAO. ICAM-1 was expressed constituently at low level
in ECs, and after cerebral ischemia its expression was
elevated hugely (Figure 5D). Furthermore, Western blot
and RT-PCR results indicated that ICAM-1 was reduced
after metformin-treatment compared to the control group
(Figure 5B-C). We also found that metformin inhibited
NF-κB phosphorylation at 1 day and 3 days after tMCAO
(Figure 5E). To determine whether metformin-induced
down-regulation of ICAM-1 was AMPK-dependent or
not, we analyzed the effect of metformin at a cellular level,
using OGD models to mimic in vivo ischemia/reperfusion
injury. First, we treated bEND.3 cells with metformin to
determine whether metformin could also increase pAMPK in vitro. We found that there was an increase in pAMPK expression at 60 and 120 minutes after metformin
treatment: the maximum effect was at 60 minutes in normal conditions (Figure 6A) and while treatment with

metformin after 6 hours of OGD, there was also an increase in p-AMPK expression 1 hour after reoxygenation
and p-AMPK levels were unregulated for at least 24 hours
after reoxygenation (Figure 6B). Second, we examined
ICAM-1 expression after 6 hours of OGD and reoxygenation with or without metformin. After OGD/reoxygenation treatment, ICAM-1 expression was up-regulated in
mRNA level and metformin inhibited this up-regulation:
the inhibitive effects began at 4 hours after reoxygenation
and were sustained for at least 24 hours after reoxygenation (Figure 6C). To test whether AMPK signaling was involved, a selective AMPK inhibitor, compound C, was used
to block the AMPK phosphorylation. First, we found that
compound C reduced metformin-induced AMPK phosphorylation, then, we used RT-PCR and Western blot to assess ICAM-1 expression after treatment. Results indicated
that metformin reduced ICAM-1 expression in both

to evaluate the effects of metformin on NF-κB activation;
the result indicated that metformin inhibited NF-κB

phosphorylation and this function was abolished by compound C (Figure 6G). Thus, we concluded that metformin
diminished ICAM-1 via an AMPK mediated signaling
pathway and AMPK-NF-κB might be involved.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that metformin protected the brain from ischemic injury through alleviating
inflammatory responses in tMCAO mice, thus improving
long-term recovery. Metformin diminished neutrophil infiltration, thereby alleviating endothelial injury and lowering
BBB permeability. These effects were potentially mediated
via an AMPK-dependent ICAM-1 down-regulation. We
also found that inhibiting AMPK activation by compound
C could reverse metformin-induced down-regulation of
ICAM-1 in vitro. Thus, we concluded that metformin

exerts its protective effect after cerebral ischemia partly
through diminished ICAM-1 expression.
Metformin is a glucose-lowering agent, and is one of the
first-line drugs recommended to treat type II diabetes mellitus [25]. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)
has revealed that metformin reduced the risk of all-cause
mortality and stroke clinically; however, these benefits
were independent of its anti-hyperglycemic effects, since
metformin reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to the
same extent as sulphonylurea and insulin [5]. Metformin
decreased myocardial injury in non-diabetic and diabetic

mice [4] and prevented the progression of heart failure in
dogs [10]. However, reports regarding neuroprotection of
metformin in cerebral ischemia were controversial. Using
a 90-minute tMCAO model, McCullough demonstrated
that chronic treatment, both pre- and post- (3 weeks),
with metformin reduced infarct volume effectively; however, pre-treatment (3 days) enhanced injury in ischemic
stroke [26]. Harada et al. showed that using 3-day metformin treatment after 2 hours of tMCAO, metformin effectively reduced infarct volume [27], which was consistent
with our result. In addition, Li has suggested that chronic
treatment (14 days in drinking water, 300 mg/kg) with
metformin in diabetic rats was protective, but acute treatment (1 day in drinking water, 300 mg/kg) exerted different effects [28]. However, we must note that different
models were used. For acute treatment, 3-hour occlusion
and 21 hours reperfusion model were used; however, for the
chronic treatment, a 90-minute occlusion and 14 days reperfusion model was adopted, and glucose level was normal
in chronic treatment rats. Thus, different animal strains and
different models may explain the different effects observed
from different studies [26]. In our study, using a 90-minute
tMCAO model in mice and treatment at the time of reperfusion, we demonstrated that metformin could alleviate
ischemic injury and improve neurobehavioral outcomes.
We demonstrated the protection by metformin on ischemic stroke involved, at least in part, AMPK activity
[3]. However, McCullough’s group found that metformin
enhanced ischemic injury in tMCAO animals in a 3-day
precondition study through activating AMPK [26]. We
believe this result can be due to the period of treatment.
Metformin could increase AMPK phosphorylation both
in vitro and in vivo [4,9]. We detected an induction of
AMPK phosphorylation in both bEND.3 cells and the
mouse brain after tMCAO. Notably, conditions that
could activate AMPK have been proven to be beneficial
in stress, particularly in ischemia. Ischemic precondition,
which can activate AMPK due to an increase of the
AMP/ATP ratio, is supposed to be protective in ischemic
stroke [29]. Adiponectin reduces infarct size in cerebral ischemia and myocardial injury has been shown to be partly
through promoting AMPK phosphorylation [30,31]. In
addition, AMPK involves pleiotropic pathways that play
critical roles in cerebral ischemia. Through suppression of

the mTOR signaling pathway, AMPK regulates cell
growth and autophagy [7]. Via activation of the Nrf2/
SKN-1 signaling pathway, AMPK increases antioxidant
gene expression [32]. By promotion of the eNOS pathway,
AMPK reduces endothelial cell apoptosis and improves
endothelial functions [9]. Furthermore, emerging evidence
shows that AMPK is beneficial to neurons suffering from
injuries such as ischemia, starvation, and oxidative damage
[11]. Collectively, these results suggest that metforminAMPK signaling pathways exert protective effects in stress
conditions and protect the brain from ischemic stroke.
The mechanism by which metformin reduces inflammation after cerebral ischemia is poorly understood. ICAM-1
expression can be regulated by the nuclear transcriptional
factor NF-κB [33]. Recently, the potency of metformin
blocking NF-κB signaling has been illustrated [34]. In
addition, metformin decreased TNF-α-induced ICAM-1
by inhibiting NF-κB activation in ECs [12]. Therefore, we
suppose that metformin reduced ICAM-1 expression via
the AMPK-NF-κB pathway. We also detected an inhibition of NF-κB activation after metformin treatment both
in vivo and in vitro. Previous study showed that there was
a huge increase of ICAM-1 expression at the time of reperfusion; in our study, metformin was administrated at
the time of reperfusion. Increased expression of adhesion
cytokine is detrimental during ischemic injury since it increases neutrophil adhesion to ECs and thus promotes
their infiltration [16]. Anti-ICAM-1 treatment significantly
reduced infarct volume [15]. Coincidently, we demonstrated that metformin decreased ICAM-1 both in vivo
and in vitro, and this reduction in ICAM-1 in vivo was accompanied by alleviated neutrophil infiltration and reduced infarct size in tMCAO mice. Furthermore, our
study indicated that this effect was possibly mediated by
AMPK in a dependent manner. We concluded that metformin conferred resistance to ischemic stroke through
decreasing ICAM-1 via the AMPK signaling pathway.
Besides increasing inflammation, neutrophil infiltration
also induces EC injury and increases BBB permeability
[35]. BBB disruption exacerbates brain injury after ischemia. Injuries such as ischemia and trauma lead to a disruption and reconstruction of ZO-1 and occludin, and an
increase in BBB permeability [23]. Reduction of BBB permeability alleviates cerebral ischemia injury in both

transient and permanent cerebral ischemia [19,22,23]. Recently, it has been reported that metformin-induced improvement of BBB functions in ECs in vitro is due to
activating AMPK activity [24]. In the present study, we
demonstrated that after metformin treatment, IgG and Evans blue leakage was significantly reduced and tight junction protein profoundly increased, leading to better
outcomes in tMCAO mice.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that metformin is beneficial to the
treatment of ischemic stroke, which is possible through
inhibiting inflammation via AMPK signaling pathways.
Since metformin is a widely used drug with few adverse
effects, using this long-established drug for a new use
may be a promising way to develop an effective therapy
for ischemic stroke [36]. Metformin has the potential to
be useful in the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.
