NSC23766, a speciﬁc inhibitor of Rac1, has recently been shown to protect against cerebral ischemic
injury, although the effects of NSC23766 in a diabetic model have not been examined. Therefore, the aim
of our study was to investigate if NSC23766 provided neuroprotection in streptozotocin-induced diabetic
rats and to determine the potential mechanism through which NSC23766 works. Diabetic Sprague
eDawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min. NSC23766 (10
or 30 mg kg1) or isotonic saline were administered intraperitoneally twice daily starting 24 h after
cerebral ischemia, for three consecutive days. Cerebral infarct volume, neurological deﬁcit scores,
neuronal apoptosis, and the release of cytochrome c, as well as the generation of ROS and mitochondrial
integrity, were evaluated 96 h after reperfusion. In addition, the mitochondrial translocation of p53 and
the expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) in the mitochondria of the cerebral
ischemic cortex were determined by western blotting. NSC23766 not only ameliorated post-ischemic
neuronal apoptosis but also decreased cerebral ischemia-induced mitochondrial p53 translocation and
the expression of PUMA in mitochondria in diabetic rats. Thus, our data indicate that NSC23766 has
therapeutic potential against cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury and that NSC23766 signiﬁcantly
ameliorates neuronal apoptosis by suppressing mitochondrial p53 translocation in streptozotocininduced diabetic rats.

1. Introduction
During anesthesia and surgery, diabetes mellitus (DM) patients
are at a higher risk for the development of cerebrovascular complications, when compared to individuals without DM, primarily
due to hyperglycemia (Ergul et al., 2012). Hyperglycemia-induced
oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been implicated in diabetic vascular complications (Kamada et al., 2007; King and Loeken,
2004; Palsamy and Subramanian, 2011)
ROS, a natural byproduct of the metabolism of oxygen, plays an
important role in cell signaling and homeostasis (Ray et al., 2012).
However, during times of environmental stress, such as hypoxia
and ischemia, ROS levels can increase dramatically, resulting in
signiﬁcant damage to cell structures (Lan et al., 2011;

Dvoriantchikova et al., 2012). It is well known that ischemic
reperfusion can induce signiﬁcant damage to the brain and that this
damage is attributable to the enhanced generation of ROS (Wang
et al., 2009, 2007). Evidence suggests that apoptosis induced by
cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury is closely correlated with
oxidative damage induced by overproduction of ROS (Wang et al.,
2007; Rodrigo et al., 2005; Peters et al.,).
NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROS, in neurons in the
central nervous system (Sorce and Krause, 2009). After an ischemic
episode, NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in the generation of
superoxide anion (O2), which is triggered by the onset of reperfusion. Under pathological conditions, superoxide anion transforms
into hydroxide (OH) (Bedard and Krause, 2007), which leads to a
cascade reaction of oxygen radicals, one of the major causes of the
delayed neuronal death in cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury
(Shen et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013). Furthermore, it has been reported that Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a
low-molecular-weight G protein, in the GTP-bound form (Rac1GTP), plays a critical role in NADPH oxidase activation after

ischemic reperfusion injury in the brain and heart and in hypoxic
cancer tissue (Raz et al., 2010; Binker et al., 2010; Shan et al., 2010).
Rac1 undergoes a rapid and prolonged activation in the hippocampus following global cerebral ischemia, and its activation parallels delayed neuronal cell death (Zhang et al., 2009). Thus, agents
that could suppress Rac1 activation would be expected to protect
neuronal cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, improving
cell survival.
NSC23766 has been shown to effectively inhibit Rac1 binding
and activation by the Rac-speciﬁc guanine nucleotide exchange
factors, such as Trio and Tiam1, in a dose-dependent manner (Gao
et al., 2004). In addition, it has been shown that NSC23766 displayed promise in the protection against cerebral ischemic injury in
non-diabetic rats (Raz et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2004). However, it is
unknown if NSC23766 provides neuroprotection in diabetic rats
and the steps in the signal transduction cascade resulting from
delayed administration of NSC23766 remain to be elucidated.
In addition, ROS generated by mitochondria have been implicated in acute brain injuries and are known to mediate molecular
signaling, such as p53. (Vaseva and Moll, 2009). The tumor suppressor gene p53 encodes a sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor
that controls apoptosis-related gene expression (Endo et al., 2006a;
Luo et al., 2009). It has been established that cytoplasmic p53
translocates rapidly to the mitochondria in response to stress signals and directly inhibits binding of Bcl-XL, inducing mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspase-9
(Endo et al., 2006b). In addition, p53-upregulated modulator of
apoptosis (PUMA), a product of p53, acts directly on mitochondria
to induce apoptosis. Recent experimental evidence has shown that
PUMA acts as a strong inducer of apoptosis by interacting with antior pro-apoptotic proteins (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al.,
2001).
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate if
delayed administration of NSC23766 in streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats could ameliorate neuronal apoptosis by suppressing
translocation of p53 to the mitochondria.
2. Materials and methods
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the standards
and procedures of the Chinese Council on Animal Care and were approved by the
Central South University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.1. Induction of diabetes
Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (250e300 g) were used in this study. Diabetes
was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg,
Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) (Rizk et al., 2006). Fasting blood glucose
levels were tested using a glucose analyzer (Accu-Chek Compact System; Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Animals were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 2 weeks after the induction of diabetes (fasting blood
glucose > 300 mg/dl).
Diabetic rats were housed in groups in a room, in which the environment was
maintained at 21e25  C, 45e50% humidity, and 12-h light/dark cycle. Rats had free
access to pellet chow and water and were randomly assigned into four groups: sham
group (S), vehicle group (V), 10 mg/kg NSC23766 group (N1), and 30 mg/kg
NSC23766 group (N2).
2.2. Drug preparation and treatment schedule
NSC23766 was obtained from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ballwin, MO, USA) and was
diluted in isotonic saline. Starting the day after MCAO, the NSC23766 treatment
groups were injected with either 10 or 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice a day (8
a.m. and 8 p.m.) for three consecutive days. The rats in the S and V groups were
injected with the same volume of isotonic saline as the treatment groups. The rats
were sacriﬁced 96 h after MCAO. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 1.
2.3. Induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion
Reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as described
previously (Ye et al., 2012). In brief, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal
chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg body weight) and inhaled oxygen, which was delivered
by a mask during the operation. Once surgical levels of anesthesia were attained,

sacriﬁced 96 h after MCAO.

which was assessed by the absence of hind leg withdrawal to pinching, ischemia was
induced using an occluding intraluminal suture. The right common carotid artery
(CCA) and the external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed by a ventral midline neck
incision and were ligated with a 3-0 silk suture. The pterygopalatine branch of the
internal carotid artery was clipped to prevent incorrect insertion of the occluding
ﬁlament. A 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Shadong Industrial Corp., China),
the tip of which had been rounded by heating near a ﬂame, was introduced into the
right internal carotid artery (ICA) via the external carotid artery (ECA). The common
carotid artery and ICA were temporarily clipped, and the suture was placed into ECA
stump and threaded into the ICA until mild resistance was felt. Mild resistance to
advancement indicated that the intraluminal occluder had entered the anterior
cerebral artery (ACA) and occluded the origin of the ACA, the middle cerebral artery
(MCA), and the posterior communicating arteries. The suture was left in place for
90 min and then withdrawn. The incision was closed and 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride was administered for postoperative analgesia. Throughout the procedure, body temperature was maintained at 37  C ± 0.5  C with a homoeothermic
blanket. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and to eat and drink
freely. The tail artery was cannulated to allow for monitoring of arterial blood
pressure and for blood collection for the analysis of blood gases (International
Technidyne Co., USA) and glucose. Physiologic variables including mean temperature, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases, and plasma glucose were
measured before occlusion, 60 min after occlusion, and 60 min after reperfusion.
2.4. Neurological evaluation and measurement of the cerebral infarct volume
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated using a modiﬁed six-point scale, as follows:
0, no deﬁcits; 1, difﬁculty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2, unable to
extend the contralateral forelimb; 3, mild circling to the contralateral side; 4, severe
circling and 5, falling to the contralateral side. An investigator blinded to the
experimental grouping carried out the evaluation. In all rats, neurological scoring
was performed at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after reperfusion.
At 96 h after reperfusion, rats (n ¼ 8 per group) were decapitated and brains
were removed. Infarct sizes were measured by staining with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (Ye et al., 2012). We modiﬁed a
previously described equation to eliminate the contribution of edema to the
ischemic lesion: corrected infarct volume ¼ contralateral hemisphere volume e
(ipsilateral hemisphere volume e measured infarct volume) (Belayev et al., 1996).
The infarct volume was presented as the percent of total brain area and was
calculated by an observer naive to the treatment group.
2.5. TUNEL staining
Sections (n ¼ 6e8 per group) were treated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Inc., Mannheim, Germany) for TUNEL
staining. In brief, after pretreatment with Proteinase K and 0.3% H2O2, sections were
incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme for 1 h at 37  C. The
sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 30 min, and 30 diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used to visualize the apoptotic cells. The photographs
were taken under high-power magniﬁcation (400  ).
2.6. Isolation of mitochondria
The ischemic penumbra regions were dissected on ice, according to previously
described methods (Ye et al., 2012). The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of the
harvested brain tissues were prepared as previously described (Ye et al., 2012). Each
brain tissue sample was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer [200 mM mannitol,
80 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor cocktail] by 35 strokes of gentle
pounding in a glass tissue grinder. Homogenates were centrifuged at 750  g for
10 min at 4  C. After removing a portion of the supernatant, the remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 8000  g for 20 min at 4  C. The mitochondrial fraction
was obtained after washing the resultant pellets three times and resuspending the

510

pellet in lysis buffer. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifuging the supernatants of the 8000  g centrifugation step at 100,000  g for 1 h at 4  C.

3. Results
3.1. Physiological variability during the study

2.7. Rac1 assay
Assays of Rac1 activation were performed according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Rac/CDC42 assay kit; Upstate Biotechnology). Precipitated complexes were
washed three times with magnesium-containing lysis buffer and were boiled in
sample buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to western
blot analysis using the anti-Rac1-speciﬁc antibody.

2.8. Measurement of ROS formation
ROS formation was assayed using a previously described dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay (HaMai et al., 2001). In brief, 10 ml of mitochondria (5e10 mg) was suspended in 170 ml HEPES buffer (120 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM NaHCO3, 6.0 mM glucose, 1.0 mM
CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in 96-well plates; 20 ml of 100 mM DCFH-DA was added
to each well, for a ﬁnal volume of 200 ml. Fluorescence was read at an excitation
wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm using a ﬂuorescent
plate reader (Genios, TEC AN). Increased ﬂuorescence intensity was considered to be
indicative of an increase in intracellular ROS.

To speciﬁcally examine the pharmacological effects of
NSC23766, rather than the neuroprotective effects resulting from
hypothermia induced by the administration of NSC23766, rectal
temperature was strictly monitored. NSC23766 did not modify
temperature over the 4-day post-MCAO period of this study
(Table 1). Mean arterial blood pressure, blood glucose, rectal temperature, hematocrit, blood pH, and blood gases (PO2 and PCO2)
were measured prior to occlusion, 60 min after occlusion, and
60 min after reperfusion. None of these parameters differed between the NSC23766 and vehicle treated rats (data not shown),
indicating that the effects observed with the administration of
NSC23766 in the present study were not related to physiological
modiﬁcations.

2.9. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were monitored in the presence
of the ﬂuorescent dye Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), as described previously, (Emaus
et al., 1986) with modiﬁcations. In brief, 10 ml of mitochondria (5e10 mg) was suspended in 90 ml of assay buffer (15 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM sodium succinate, 5 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in 96-well plates and was incubated for
30 min in the presence of 20 ml of 100 ug/mL Rh123. The change of mitochondrial
membrane potential was determined by measuring the ﬂuorescence change in the
reaction mixture at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength
of 538 nm. The results were expressed as ﬂuorescence intensity.

2.10. Measurement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening with
calcein AM
The opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) was determined using a commercially available kit (GENMED SCIENTIFICS INC. U.S.A). All
procedures followed the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated mitochondria were co
loaded with 1 mM calcein AM and 1 mM CoCl2 at room temperature in working
solution (pH ¼ 7.2). The working solution consisting of 10 mM EGTA-CaEGTA buffer
(free Ca2þ concentration 100 nM), 3 mM free Mg2þ, 20 mM taurine, 0.5 mM
dithiothreitol, 20 mM imidazole, 0.16 M potassium 4-morpholineethanesulfonate
and 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was used for MPTP measurement. MPTP opening was measured directly using a combination of calcein AM and
CoCl2. Calcein AM, which ﬂuoresces upon binding with Ca2þ, was used to detect
transient MPTP opening in intact cells. This was achieved by monitoring changes in
mitochondrial Ca2þ levels in the presence of CoCl2, which quenched the cytosolic
Ca2þ signal produced by calcein AM. The ﬂuorescence of calcein AM was monitored
at an emission/excitation wavelength of 530/488 nm. The extent of Ca2þ-induced
MPTP opening was estimated by determining the difference in ﬂuorescence
intensity.

2.11. Western blotting
Equal amounts of protein (50e100 ug) were loaded in each well and subjected to
10% sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Separated proteins were then transferred from the gel to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF;
Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) membranes and blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk prepared in 1X TBST. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4  C. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies towards
cytochrome c, p53, and PUMA (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA);
caspase-3 and caspase-9 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA);
GAPDH (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA); and COX IV (1:1000
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The membranes were washed with 1X TBST and the
membranes incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature. The blots were developed using an ECL plus detection system (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and relative band density measured using the
FluorChem FC2 System (NatureGene Corp., USA).

2.12. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls or
Dunnett's tests (SPSS, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to
be statistically signiﬁcant.

To determine the percentage of infarct area in the brain, TTC
staining of brain slices was assessed 96 h of after reperfusion. The
infarct size in the vehicle group rats was 47.52% ± 5.28% of total
brain area. Administration of NSC23766 at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg
signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct sizes to 34.75% ± 3.84% and
32.81% ± 4.62%, respectively (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). However, infarct
size did not differ signiﬁcantly between the N1 and N2 groups
(P > 0.05). Thus, NSC23766 can prevent ischemia/reperfusion
induced brain injury in a dose-independent manner (Fig. 2B).
Serial changes in the neurological deﬁcit score in response to
MCA occlusion and administration of NSC23766 are shown in
Fig. 2C. At 24 h post-occlusion, the neurological deﬁcit score was
not different between the vehicle- and NSC23766-treated groups.
In the vehicle-treated group, the deﬁcit score did not change from
24 h to 96 h after MCA occlusion. In contrast, in the NSC23766treated groups, the deﬁcit score improved from 48 h to 96 h after
MCA occlusion (P < 0.05).

3.3. Neuronal apoptosis
After 96 h of reperfusion, there were numerous TUNEL positive
cells in the vehicle group. In the sham group, TUNEL staining was
negative. Treatment with NSC23766 signiﬁcantly reduced the
number of TUNEL positive cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). However, the
number of TUNEL positive cells did not differ signiﬁcantly between
the N1 and N2 treatment groups (P > 0.05).
To determine the release of cytochrome c, we determined the
ratio of the amount of cytochrome c in the cytoplasmic fraction to
the total cytochrome c in the cytoplasmic fraction and the mitochondrial fraction. In the vehicle group, 58.40% ± 7.74% of

cytochrome c was released, whereas 10.62% ± 1.84% of cytochrome
c was released in the sham group (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Delayed
administration of NSC23766 signiﬁcantly attenuated the release of
cytochrome c induced by ischemic reperfusion injury
(34.56% ± 5.13% and 32.69% ± 4.58% released cytochrome c in the
N1 and N2 treatment groups, respectively).
In the sham group, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were barely
detectable by western blotting. However, in the vehicle group, the
activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the penumbra cortex were
increased markedly (P < 0.05; Fig. 3C). Delayed administration of
NSC23766 signiﬁcantly reduced the caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities (P < 0.05).

3.4. NSC23766-delayed postconditioning attenuates the activities
of Rac1 after reperfusion
As shown in Fig. 4, western blot analysis showed that total Rac1
protein levels in the penumbral cortex did not change signiﬁcantly
in any of the treatment groups. In contrast, there was a marked
elevation in the activated Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) in the vehicle group,
compared to the sham controls. Delayed administration of
NSC23766 signiﬁcantly reduced activated Rac1.
3.5. Mitochondrial integrity
To determine the mitochondrial integrity, we measured opening
of the MPTP and mitochondrial membrane potential. Opening of
the MPTP is important in mitochondrial events that lead to programmed cell death. In the vehicle group, the activity of MPTP in
the cerebral cortex was signiﬁcantly increased when compared to
the sham group (P < 0.05). In addition, MPTP activity in the cerebral
cortex was decreased in the NSC23766 treatment groups (P < 0.05;
Fig. 5A).
Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential occurs as a result of
the MPTP opening. As shown in Fig. 5B, ischemic reperfusion injury
induced a signiﬁcant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in
the cerebral cortex mitochondria in the vehicle group (P < 0.05). In
contrast, in the NSC23766 treatment groups, there was a rescue of
the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.05).
3.6. Mitochondrial ROS formation
To determine if the protective effect observed with NSC23766
treatment is due to a reduction in ROS production, mitochondrial
ROS production was measured using DCFH-DA. As shown in Fig. 6,
ischemic reperfusion injury signiﬁcantly increased ROS production
in the cerebral cortex mitochondria in the vehicle group (P < 0.05

compared to the sham group). DCF production levels were signiﬁcantly decreased in the cerebral cortex mitochondria of the
NSC23766 treatment groups, when compared to those of the
vehicle group (P < 0.05).
3.7. Effect of delayed application of NSC23766 on mitochondrial
p53 translocation and on PUMA expression in the mitochondria
Using western blot analysis, we determined the effect of
NSC23766 treatment on ischemia-induced translocation of p53 to
the mitochondria. Mitochondrial translocation of p53 was represented by the ratio of p53 in the cytoplasmic fraction to p53 in the
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions. In the vehicle group,
mitochondrial translocation of p53 was 68.37% ± 6.57%, whereas for
the sham group, mitochondrial translocation of p53 was
9.02% ± 1.39% (P < 0.05; Fig. 7A and B). Administration of NSC23766
signiﬁcantly attenuated mitochondrial translocation of p53
induced by ischemic reperfusion injury (43.59% ± 6.85% and
42.32% ± 5.34% mitochondrial translocation of p53 in the N1 and N2
treatment groups, respectively) (see Fig. 7C).
The expression of PUMA in the mitochondria of the penumbra
cortex was barely detectable in the sham group. However,
NSC23766 signiﬁcantly suppressed PUMA activation in the mitochondria, when compared to the vehicle group (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C).
4. Discussion
Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are at a 2 or 6 times higher risk
of a cerebrovascular event when compared to individuals without
DM (Sanders and Grocott, 2012; Ergul et al., 2012). Under hyperglycemia conditions, the brain is more susceptible to oxidative
injury than normal due to the higher glucose metabolic rate, higher
levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and lower concentrations of
antioxidants. Although the mechanisms of cerebral damage related
to hyperglycemia are complex, elevated levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which are attributable to hyperglycemia, cause
cellular injury through lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and
apoptosis (Kamada et al., 2007; King and Loeken, 2004; Palsamy
and Subramanian, 2011). In addition, ROS are implicated in
neuronal cell death after a number of deleterious stimuli, and inhibition of the production of ROS is an important therapeutic
strategy for neuronal protection (Hu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012).
It has previously been shown NADPH oxidase is a major complex
that produces oxygen-derived free radicals during ischemic periods
(Shen et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2009). Furthermore,
transient cerebral ischemia is known to generate ROS via NADPH
oxidase in neuronal cells in damaged brain tissue. Activation of
NADPH oxidase is achieved with the migration of GTP-Rac1 and the
cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox from the cytoplasm to the
membrane, forming the active NADPH oxidase complex (Anderson
et al., 2010; Kao et al., 2008). Rac1 is known to be a key activator of
NADPH oxidase (Hordijk, 2006; Nikolova et al., 2005). Inhibition of
Rac1 strongly reduces NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production after global cerebral ischemia. NSC23766, which is a speciﬁc
inhibitor of Rac1, has potent neuroprotective properties in nondiabetic rats (Zhang et al., 2009). In the current study, we further
conﬁrmed that activated Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) was signiﬁcantly
elevated in the vehicle group after reperfusion as compared to
sham controls, whereas NSC23766 treatment not only attenuated
the activation of Rac1, but also provided protection against cerebral
ischemic injury in diabetic rats, as shown by improved neurological
deﬁcit scores and decreased infarct sizes.
There is increasing evidence that Rac1 undergoes a rapid and
prolonged activation following global cerebral ischemia, and its
activation has a pro-apoptotic role (Zhang et al., 2009; Johanna

post-ischemic apoptosis by TUNEL staining and found that the
number of TUNEL-positive cells was markedly reduced in the
ischemic hemisphere in diabetic rats treated with NSC23766 as

compared with vehicle-treated control rats. In neurons, mitochondria are central integrators and transducers of apoptotic signals. Changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability,
mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c
are thought to be pivotal events in neuronal apoptosis (Budd et al.,
2000), and it has been suggested that these events occur neurons
after a stroke (Mattson et al., 2000). To determine whether
NSC23766 modulated apoptosis-related events in mitochondria,
we determined the effects of NSC23766 on mitochondrial membrane potential and on the opening of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores (MPTP). NSC23766 caused a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and in MPTP opening, indicating that NSC23766 could retain mitochondrial integrity postischemia. We next conﬁrmed that NSC23766 inhibited the release
of cytochrome c from mitochondria of neurons exposed to ischemic
insults. It is known that caspases play a central role in apoptotic cell
death. Cytoplasmic leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial
intermembrane space triggers the rapid activation of caspase-9.
Active caspase-9 cleaves caspase-3, facilitating the activation of
the caspase-dependent cell death pathway. We showed that
delayed NSC23766 treatment attenuated activation of caspase-3
and caspase-9. Thus, our results indicate that delayed NSC23766
administration protects neurons against apoptosis by retaining
mitochondrial integrity post-ischemia, preventing the release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria and inhibiting the activation
of caspases-3 and caspase-9.
It has been shown recently that p53 is involved in the neuronal
apoptosis that occurs with cerebral ischemic injury (Endo et al.,
2006a, 2006b; Luo et al., 2009). p53 plays a role in the expression
of pro-apoptotic genes and is involved in the synthesis and mitochondrial translocation of Bax and other p53-inducible genes. In
addition, it has been shown that p53-deﬁcient mice show reduced
neuronal apoptosis after ischemia (Yonekura et al., 2006). In some
cell types, a fraction of p53 rapidly translocates to mitochondria in
response to a death stimulus. Mitochondrial p53 is able to trigger
apoptosis through a transcription-independent mechanism. Recent
studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial p53 translocation
and direct inhibitory binding to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 induce mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of
caspase-3 and caspase-9, resulting in delayed cell death of neurons
after ischemia (Endo et al., 2006a, 2006b). PUMA (p53-upregulated
modulator of apoptosis), which was originally identiﬁed as a direct
target of p53, has been reported to be a strong inducer of apoptosis.
PUMA localizes to mitochondria and interacts with both proapoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL through a BH3
domain, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and in the activation of caspases (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al., 2001).
Thus, p53 and PUMA in mitochondria are crucial for the cerebral
protection against ischemic-reperfusion injury observed with
delayed administration of NSC23766.
Although we have shown that NSC3766 inhibits mitochondrial
p53 translocation, the mechanism through which NSC23766 inhibits mitochondrial p53 translocation remains to be elucidated. It
has been reported that ROS generated from mitochondria appears
to be involved in mitochondrial p53 translocation. The loss of the
mitochondrial membrane potential, the opening of MPTP, and a
large increase in mitochondrial free radical generation have been
identiﬁed as the ﬁrst step of the apoptotic process. Superabundant
ROS produced during the ischemic reperfusion period, especially in
conditions of hyperglycemia, induce p53 translocation to the
mitochondria and activate downstream signals, including PUMA
that trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and cause the
release of critical apoptotic activators and effectors of cell death
from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Delayed administration of NSC23766 ameliorated mitochondrial ROS formation

post-ischemia by inhibiting activation of Rac1 and by interrupting
the subsequent cascade reaction.
Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, in the
present study, we did not use laser Doppler ﬂowmetry to conﬁrm
successful placement of the occluding ﬁlament other than by
advancing the ﬁlament until resistance was felt. Unfortunately, it
maybe exist a possibility that the ﬁlament did not occlude the
origin of the MCA. Second, it is unclear whether NSC23766 at this
dose and modality administered is similarly protective in nondiabetic rats.
Therefore, we clearly demonstrated that in streptozotocininduced diabetic rats, administration of NSC23766 after MCAO
provides cerebral protection against ischemic reperfusion injuryinduced apoptosis by suppressing translocation of p53 to the
mitochondria.
