Background and Purpose—Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of upper extremity motor impairments. Although several
well-characterized experimental stroke models exist, modeling of upper extremity motor impairments, which are unique
to primates, is not well established. Cortical representation of dexterous movements in nonhuman primates is functionally
and topographically similar to that in humans. In this study, we characterize the African green monkey model of focal
ischemia reperfusion with a defined syndrome, impaired dexterous movements.
Methods—Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the M3 segment of the left middle cerebral artery.
Motor and cognitive functions after stroke were evaluated using the object retrieval task with barrier-detour. Postmortem
magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology were performed to map and characterize the infarct.
Results—The middle cerebral artery occlusion consistently produced a necrotic infarct localized in the sensorimotor cortex
in the middle cerebral artery territory. The infarction was reproducible and resulted in significant loss of fine motor
function characterized by impaired dexterity. No significant cognitive impairment was detected. Magnetic resonance
imaging and histopathology demonstrated consistent and significant loss of tissue on the left parietal cortex by the central
sulcus covering the sensorimotor area. The results suggest that this species has less collateralization, which closely
resembles humans.
Conclusions—The reported nonhuman primate model produces a defined and reproducible syndrome relevant to
our understanding of ischemic stroke, cortical representation, and sensorimotor integration controlling dexterous
movements. This model will be useful in basic and translational research addressing loss of arm function and dexterity.

neuroprotective therapies in small animal models for stroke7,8
prompted recommendations for additional research and development in large animal models with physiological, structural,
and functional traits closer to those of humans before clinical
trials.9,10 There has been a concerted effort in developing relevant large animal models.11,12 Interspecies comparison suggests that cerebral venous angioarchitecture in large animals
is closer to that of humans13; nevertheless, such models remain
relatively underdeveloped. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models
offer an assessment of complex physiological, immunologic,
biochemical, and behavioral outcomes most similar to those
of humans.14–24 These outcome measures complement those
from other animal models by improving our understanding

he World Health Organization reports that stroke claims
6.2 million lives each year. There are ≈5.4 million stroke
survivors with ≈80% requiring hand therapy.1 The estimated
economic burden for stroke exceeds $56.8 billion per year in
the United States alone.
Acute thrombolysis has a significant impact on the management of stroke,2,3 with a therapeutic window that may extend
≤6 hours with intra-arterial delivery.4 Yet only a minority of
stroke victims benefit, and the majority experience progression of ischemia associated with neurological disabilities.
Animal models that recapitulate human disabilities and disease pathology remain an unmet need in stroke research. There
has been a tremendous advance in developing rodent experimental model stroke (reviewed in Durukan and Tatlisumak5

The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) for Axion Research Foundation/St
Kitts Biomedical Research Foundation. The facility is accredited by
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC), and all procedures prescribed by AAALAC, Office
of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) standards, and National
Institutes of Health guidelines were followed, including the use of
anesthetics and analgesics for surgery and killing and animal welfare
conditions for housing and care. Six male African green monkeys
(Cercopithecus sabaeus) originating from St Kitts and weighing 4.5
to 5.5 kg were used in this study. Steps taken to ameliorate suffering
are included in animal handling procedures described below in this
section.

NHP Ischemia Model
Monkeys were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia by temporarily occluding the left-side middle cerebral artery (MCA). Under
general anesthesia, a curvilinear incision was made extending from
anterior to the right tragus up to the midline, and the skin flap and
temporal muscle were reflected inferiorly to expose the pterional
area. Using a 1 cm trephine, a craniotomy was performed on the
left-side temporal bone of the skull, and the dura mater was separated from the tissue. Thereafter, using the standard microsurgical
technique, the Sylvian fissure was located and the M3 in the sylvian
insular cistern was exposed. Two aneurysm clips were placed with
≈3 mm of space between them occluding the M3 segment of the
MCA. After 90 minutes of occlusion, the clips were removed and
reperfusion achieved. Previous studies have reported that 90-minute occlusion of MCA produces significant stroke in NHP.25–27 The
dura was closed and covered with gel foam, and the bone flap was
secured with a 2.0 chromic suture. The skin was closed with 2.0
vicryl in the galea and finally sealed with dermabond glue. Post surgery, the animals were administered Flocillin (300 000 U) and prophylactic anti-seizure medication Dilantin (5 mg/kg). Intravenous
fluids were administered until the animals reached full consciousness with good reflexes. Carprofen (4 mg/kg) was administered, and
the animals were returned to their cage followed by an additional
dose at 48 hours after surgery. The animals were continuously monitored and clinically observed twice a day for 5 days for any signs
of discomfort, and appropriate care was provided when needed. All
animals regained activity the following day after surgery, and we
had no mortality. Food consumption, body weight, attitude, posture,
excreta, appearance, and movements were observed and recorded.
If an animal experienced loss of appetite, an electrolyte replacement drink, soft foods, and fruits were offered. Analgesics were
given for 2 days. Antibiotics were administered for 5 days after the
surgical procedure. All the animals were euthanized 5 weeks after
the surgery by transcardially perfusing them with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution under deep anesthesia (ketamine, 10 mg/
kg, pentobarbital 100 mg/kg). The brains were then collected and
preserved in 5% formalin and 20% sucrose solution for further histological analysis.

Object Retrieval Task With a Barrier-Detour
The object retrieval task with a barrier-detour, as previously
described,28 was used to evaluate the cognitive and motor functions of

monkeys after experimental ischemic stroke. The task involved monkeys retrieving a reward (fruit) from the open side (bypassing the barrier) of a transparent box that was fastened to a tray. The orientation
of the box opening was changed during the testing period. Behavioral
testing was done for 8 days, and all the tests were conducted 23
hours after the animal’s last meal. During each trial, the experimenter
scored several responses. For every attempt made by the animal, the
experimenter noted 3 items on the scoring sheet: (1) ability of the
animal to reach the front, left, or right side of the box, scored under
the term reach act; (2) hand of choice for the reach, either left or right,
scored under the term hand used; (3) the outcome of the reach, either
success or failure, scored under result section.
Using the above parameters, several additional variables were
derived for analysis. Motor problem: Reaching into the open side of
the box but without retrieving the reward. This was scored with sensitivity to the problematic hand; left motor problem and right motor
problem. Initiation time: Latency from the screen being raised to the
subject touching the box or reward. Execution: Retrieving the reward
from the box on the first reach of the trial (indicates competence on
the task). Correct: Eventually retrieving the reward from the box on
the trial (>1 reach on the trial to retrieve the reward because unlimited reaches per trial were allowed). Reach number: Number of times
the animal made an attempt and touched the box. Hand preference:
Hand (left or right) that the subject used for the first reach of the
trial. Hand bias: Total number of left and right hand reaches on each
trial. Awkward reach: Reaching with the hand farthest away from the
box opening (either the left or right side). Perseverative response:
Repeating a reach to the side of the box that was previously open but
then closed. Barrier reach: Reaching and touching the closed side of
the test box.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI of the postmortem brains was done using the microSigna 7.0
T-MR scanner (7.0T/310/AS System) 5 weeks after the MCA occlusion surgery. The instrument comprised a 310 mm (horizontal) bore
scanner, including gradient drivers, EXCITE2 electronics, 8-channel multicoil RF and multinuclear capabilities and volume RF
coils, and the supporting LX11 platform. The Resonance Research
Instruments BFG-150/90-S shielded gradient insert (770 mT/m,
SR-2500 T/m per second) had a bore size of 9 cm. The imaging protocol consisted of 2D multislice imaging followed by a spin-echo
sequence, using the following parameters: echo time=82.5 ms, repetition time=4000 ms, number of excitations=10, 5 cm×5 cm field
of view, matrix=256×256, slice thickness =0.6 mm, gap=0. Serial
MRI scans from each animal were used to measure tissue loss to the
ischemic lesion. The lesion was outlined and the infarct size determined as percent of healthy tissue loss in the ipsilateral hemisphere
compared with the contralateral one. The results were expressed as
mean±standard deviation.

Infarct Size
Brain slices throughout the rostro-caudal extent were processed
for cresyl violet (CV) and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The
CV-stained sections were scanned, and image J (National Institutes
of Health) was used to determine the size of the infarct. For each
animal (stroked [n=3] and control [n=3]), the lesion size was determined by subtracting the area of the intact tissue in the ipsilateral
hemisphere from the area of the contralateral hemisphere and then
expressed as a percentage of contralateral hemisphere. All the values were normalized to control animals and plotted using graph pad
prism software.

Statistical Analysis
All the behavioral data were analyzed and plotted using Graph Pad
Prism 5. A t test was used to identify significant differences between
2 groups. For comparing multiple groups, 2-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Bonferroni analysis was performed to identify the significant differences. P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

In all animals, the occlusion consistently produced apparent
disability in the right hand after surgery (Figure 1A), with a
focal necrotic infarct on the left parietal cortex by the central
sulcus covering the sensorimotor area (Figure 1B and 1C).
T2-weighted MRI scans showed the location of the lesion in the
area supplied by this segment of the MCA on several serial scans
(Figure 2A–2C) for each experimental case. Measurements of
the infarct lesion showed 12.4±4.7% tissue loss relative to the
contralateral side.

Motor and Cognitive Assessments
The object retrieval task with a barrier-detour model28 was used
to evaluate motor and cognitive functions. During the task, the act
of retrieving the reward measured the motor function, whereas
the ability to learn, to detour the transparent barrier when the box
orientation was modified, measured the cognitive capabilities.
Three weeks after transient left MCA occlusion, the monkeys
showed no significant deficit in the object retrieval task using the
left (ipsilateral) healthy hand (Figure 3A1 and 3A2). However,
deficits in the right hand (contralateral) fine motor skills were
readily detectable. The deficit was characterized by the inability of the monkeys to grasp and retrieve the reward (fruit) using
their right hand when the opening was on the respective side
(Figure 3B1–3B4). There was a clear rigidity in the fingers and
loss of dexterity in grasping the fruit (Figure 3B1 and 3B2),

suggesting lesion in the cortical area processing the sensorimotor inputs controlling finger movement. Notably, during task
performance, animals with stroke consistently used their healthy
left hand against the closed side of the box for support to retrieve
the fruit (Figure 3B1–3B3). These behavioral tests were videorecorded, and movie of one of the stroke animals performing
the retrieval task is presented (Movie in the online-only Data
Supplement). This compensatory behavior parallels the complex compensatory strategies stroke victims use to perform
motor tasks.
Quantitative analysis of the fruit retrieval task revealed that
the right arm motor deficit in stroke group was significantly
(P<0.05) higher compared with control (Figure 4A1). The
deficit was particularly severe in the animal with ID No Z288
in the stroke group. No significant differences were observed
in the use of the left ipsilateral arm (Figure 4A2). Furthermore,
the total motor deficit, that is, right and left combined, was significantly (P<0.05) higher in all animals with stroke compared
with the controls (Figure 4A3). Overall, left MCA occlusion
produced a significant (P<0.05) right arm motor deficit and
total motor deficit in the stroke animals compared with the
control animals (Figure 4A4).
Analysis of movement initiation time was similar among
control and stroke groups (Figure 4B1). The execution of the
movement was also similar between the stroke and control
groups (Figure 4B2). In addition, the total number of attempts
made by the animals during the tests was similar among all
groups (Figure 4C1). We then determined whether animals

with ischemic damage had a bias toward the use of the ipsilateral limb. Two out of 3 (Z267 and Z288) animals in the
stroke group showed a trend in preference toward the use of
ipsilateral arm; however, this difference was not significant

(Figure 4C2). Interestingly, animal No Z288, which demonstrated severe contralateral motor deficit, also scored significantly (P<0.05) higher in the awkward reach when compared
with control (Figure 4C3).

The cognitive functions after stroke were evaluated by
analyzing the perseverative response and number of barrier
reaches made by the monkeys during each trial. Our analysis indicated that the perseverative response (Figure 4D1) and
barrier reach (Figure 4D2) were similar between stroke and
the control animals with no significant differences.

Stroke Location and Size

To analyze ischemic zone and quantify the size of the infarct,
CV and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed on
serial sets of brain sections (Figure 5). The histological analysis demonstrated that the stroke animals had a focal necrotic
infarct on the left sensorimotor cortex (Figure 5A). The infarct
was evident by the high infiltration of monocytes, proliferation of connective tissue, and the large number of darkly
stained and necrotic cells on CV-stained sections (Figure 5B1
and 5B2). The ischemic damaged tissues showed reactive
astrocytes with vesicular nuclei, figures of shrunk neuronal
perikarya with condensed pyknotic nuclei, and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing indicative of inflammatory reaction
(Figure 5B1–5B3). In contrast, CV- and hematoxylin and
eosin–stained control brain tissue showed prominent neurons
with cytoplasmic extensions, clear nucleus, and nucleolus
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). The CV-stained
sections were used to outline the infarct and quantitatively
measure the infarct size (see Method Section). Stroke animals
had significant tissue loss (11%) in the ipsilateral hemisphere
(P<0.05) compared with control animals (Figure 5C).

Discussion
We describe an NHP model of focal ischemia reperfusion
with a defined syndrome, loss of arm function, and impaired

dexterity. We used the object retrieval task with a barrierdetour behavioral paradigm to quantify the fine motor skills
and cognitive deficits. MRI and histopathologic analysis demonstrated the location of the infarct in the sensorimotor region
of the cortex and a significant loss of the tissue in the lesioned
hemisphere.
Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of upper extremity
motor impairments and in severe cases causes hemiparesis.29
It is estimated that each year ≈80% of stroke survivors require
hand therapy.1 The death of the neurons with highly specific
functions in the infarct zone causes severe sensorimotor
impairments and paralysis in patients.30 Gross motor dysfunction recovery occurs early on, whereas the recovery of fine
motor functions, such as grip strength, fine manipulation, and
writing, is difficult and sometimes requires extended periods
of physiotherapy.
Developing NHP animal models with consistent and a
reproducible ischemic lesion and syndrome is desirable for
studying the multifaceted brain response to stroke and for
developing therapeutic approaches. Various NHP models of
stroke have been reported using different surgical techniques
in the marmosets:15,31 African green monkey,26 baboon,17,32
macaques,20,21,33–36 and squirrel monkeys.16 However, to date,
there has been less emphasis on outcome measures and disabilities relevant to daily living activities, such as dexterous
movements. We report an African green monkey model of
transient focal ischemia induced with open surgery to access
the MCA through a pterional craniotomy. The location of
the lesion is critical to successfully demonstrate the clinical ischemic stroke. MRI and histopathologic analysis confirmed that the necrotic infarct produced was localized in
the sensorimotor cortex in the MCA territory. This parallels

the embolic obstruction of the MCA that is a major cause
of ischemic stroke in humans.14 These data suggest that
the African green monkey has less collateralization, which
closely resembles humans. Another species with less collateralization is Macaca fascicularis,20,37 while the baboon
(Papio anubis) and rhesus (Macaca Mulatta) exhibit collateralization that requires occluding other segments of the
MCA.21,38–40
Studies have previously reported the correlation between
functional outcome and size of the infarct.41–43 In the squirrel monkey, focal stroke induced by vascular coagulation
using a bipolar electrocoagulator in M1 hand area of the cortex produced motor deficits according to the extent of the
injury.16 In the present study, the analysis of infarct size indicated that all the monkeys with stroke had significant loss
of tissue and functional impairments. The evidence suggests
that the craniotomy approach to access and occlude MCA
works for the African green monkey and provides consistent well-tolerated focal ischemia. The advantages of this
approach complement features offered by other NHP models
of stroke, such as the transorbital approach,44 endovascular
approach,26 and photothrombotic stroke.45 These data are in
agreement with previous reports12,20,25,26 and suggests that the
open surgical model provides less variability in volume and
outcome measures and rare mortality in comparison to the
endovascular approach,20,37 including the autologous blood
clots model.33,34,46 The restoration of blood flow and reperfusion post occlusion in the ischemic area are readily achieved
and provide a transient model to study reperfusion injury in
NHP. Post-surgical complications were minimum with no
mortality.
Modeling hand dexterity impairments seen in humans
during the chronic phase of ischemic injury is lacking. NHP
offer unique opportunities to address this gap and further our
understanding of cortical control of arm function. The objectretrieval task with a barrier-detour described in this study has
been used to evaluate the motor and cognitive functions in
various neurological disorders.28,47,48 By carefully monitoring
the subject’s activity during the task, several motor and cognitive functions can be quantified. The behavioral changes
observed in the current model are clinically relevant because
recently it has been suggested that initial severity of upper
limb weakness can be an important predictor of recovery
from upper limb motor dysfunction in stroke patients.49,50 It is
important to acknowledge that although this animal model is
promising, from a translational perspective, its effectiveness
has yet to be validated in humans. Although NHP are close
to humans on many aspects, some differences remain to be
considered and studied, such as the expression and sequence
homologies of a therapeutic target and validity for drug
screening.51,52 In addition, ethical, infrastructural, and financial issues are inherent to NHP models and must be taken into
consideration. Therefore, NHP models are valuable for studies leading to first-in-human clinical trials and ideally extending on Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR)-compliant studies with compelling evidence-based
efficacy and safety results in rodents,53 sheep,12 pig11 or other
animal models.

We report no significant cognitive deficits, which is not
surprising given that the focal ischemic infarct was mainly
located in the sensorimotor cortex. However, we cannot
exclude cognitive disabilities in early time points during
the first or second week post stroke. Future studies will be
required to investigate both motor and cognitive deficits in
various early time points. Cognition may play a role in sensorimotor performance in NHP and in patients with brain
injuries.15,20,54,55 Our data showed no significant difference in
the ipsilateral arm performance between stroke and control
animals (data not shown). These findings support previous
observations in humans that impairment in dexterity in the
ipsilateral hand correlates with cognitive deficits affecting
perception and control of action.56
This study represents a different approach to developing
NHP models by addressing a single aspect of neurological dysfunction, that is, impaired dexterity, and may lead to
better understanding of the plasticity in the integration of
sensorimotor inputs during the recovery period. Better understanding of fundamental cellular and molecular brain-coping
mechanisms may translate to novel hand neuro-restorative
strategies.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Figure and Video Legends
Supplemental Figure I. A. Representative low power image of the cresyl violet
(CV) stained brain section from a control animal. A1 & A2. Inserts depict high
power images of the section. Cortical neurons (arrowheads) appear healthy with
dendritic and axonal projections. B. Representative low power image of the
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained brain section from a control animal. B1 &
B2. High power inserts of the H&E staining. Arrowheads indicate the morphology
of healthy cortical neurons with visible nucleus and nucleolus. In contrast to
stroke animals, notice the lack of inflammatory reaction around the small blood
vessels. Bars: (A, B) 2.5 mm, (A1, A2, B1, B2) 15 µm.
Video recording of the object retrieval task with a barrier-detour.
Video recording showing African green monkey with stroke performing the
retrieval task with barrier-detour. The first part of the video shows the ipsilateral
left arm performing the fruit retrieval. The orientation of the box opening was then
changed. The second part of the video shows motor problems experienced
during the use of the right contralateral arm in retrieving the fruit.
