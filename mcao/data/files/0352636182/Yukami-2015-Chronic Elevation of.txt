Background and Purpose—Leptomeningeal collateral growth is a key factor that defines the severity of ischemic stroke.
Patients with stroke generally have vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus; however, consensus is lacking on
how diabetes mellitus affects leptomeningeal arteriogenesis. We investigate the influence of diabetes mellitus on the
leptomeningeal arteriogenesis.
Methods—We measured the vessel diameter of the leptomeningeal anastomoses 14 days after the common carotid artery
occlusion in db/db, db/+, and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice. In another set of these mice, we measured
the infarct volume attributed to subsequent middle cerebral artery occlusion 14 days after the common carotid artery
occlusion. Mac-2–positive cells on the dorsal brain surface and the mRNA expression of several macrophage-related
factors in the cerebral cortex were examined. Finally, we tested whether the leptomeningeal arteriogenesis could be
restored by pharmaceutical intervention in the db/db mice.
Results—Cerebral hypoperfusion led to significant ipsilateral leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/+ mice and
streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice. The collateral growth contributed to reduced infarct volume. In contrast,
leptomeningeal arteriogenesis was impaired in the db/db mice. The number of Mac-2–positive cells was increased
and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression was induced after common carotid artery occlusion in the db/+
mice. However, these responses were not observed in the db/db mice. Administration of the tumor necrosis factor-α
inhibitor etanercept before common carotid artery occlusion restored the hypoperfusion-induced leptomeningeal
collateral growth in db/db mice.
Conclusions—These results indicate that leptomeningeal arteriogenesis is impaired in db/db mice and that suppression of
the tumor necrosis factor-α response to hypoperfusion is the major contributing factor.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1657-1663.

ollateral arterial growth (arteriogenesis) plays a crucial
role in ischemic stroke and is a key factor that defines the
severity and functional prognosis of this disease.1 The circle of
Willis and leptomeningeal anastomoses are typical intracranial
collaterals.2 In the case of middle cerebral artery occlusion, the
Circle of Willis is no longer able to contribute collateral blood
supply and leptomeningeal anastomoses become the primary
source of collateral blood flow. We previously reported that
unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion induces
ipsilateral leptomeningeal collateral growth after 14 days in
rodents.3,4 Using this established model to estimate leptomeningeal arteriogenesis, we showed that hematopoietic factors
enhance arteriogenesis in mice.3,5 We also demonstrated that

leptomeningeal collateral growth induced by cerebral hypoperfusion is impaired in spontaneous hypertensive rats4 and
apolipoprotein E–knockout mice.6 Vascular risk factors induce
vascular dysfunction and may be related to impaired arteriogenesis. Diabetes mellitus is also a major vascular risk factor because the prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. Diabetes mellitus
is associated with an increased risk of first ischemic stroke,
and 60% to 70% patients with ischemic stroke have diabetes
mellitus or prediabetes mellitus.7 It was previously reported
that diabetes mellitus impairs arteriogenesis in peripheral8 and
coronary arteries,9,10 but it is not fully understood whether it
impairs arteriogenesis in the cerebral vessels.

Because it was previously reported that monocytes and
macrophages play an essential role in arteriogenesis, we
searched the profiles of several macrophage-related factors after CCA occlusion. During the screening process, we
focused on the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a proinflammatory cytokine that plays important roles in inflammation,
cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis.11 TNF-α
is primarily secreted by monocytes and macrophages and is
related to various pathological conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic diseases. TNF-α mediates
the impairment of vascular function associated with the insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus that accompany obesity. It
was also previously reported that TNF-α plays an important
role in arteriogenesis.12–14
In this study, we hypothesized that TNF-α signaling perturbations might be related to impaired collateral growth in
diabetes mellitus. Here, we investigated the leptomeningeal
arteriogenesis induced by cerebral hypoperfusion in db/db
mice and found that abnormal TNF-α signaling was associated with impaired leptomeningeal arteriogenesis. In addition,
we tested the effect of TNF-α inhibition before CCA occlusion on collateral growth.

Materials and Methods
More details are available in the online-only Data Supplement.

Animals
Db/db (BKS.Cg-Dock7m+/+Leprdb/J; type 2 diabetes mellitus)
and db/+ (normoglycemic genetic controls of db/db) mice (12–13
weeks old; Charles River Japan Inc) were used in this study. We
also used C57BL/6 strain mice (11–12 weeks old) intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (250 mg/kg). All mice were given
free access to food and water before and after all procedures. The
experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Osaka University Graduate School
of Medicine and all experiments were performed in accordance
with the Osaka University Regulations on Animal Experiments. We
assigned the db/db mice, db/+ mice, and streptozotocin-induced

hyperglycemic mice to the CCA occlusion or sham groups. Latex
perfusion was performed to visualize the leptomeningeal anastomoses 14 days after CCA surgery, as previously reported.3 In another set of mice, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded by
electrocoagulation 14 days after the CCA surgery as previously
described.3,5

Etanercept Administration
In the experiment with the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept, the db/db
mice were injected intraperitoneally with either etanercept (5 mg/kg
per day) or saline 3× daily on alternate days. Detailed protocol is
available in the online-only Data Supplement methods.

Results
Hypoperfusion-Induced Leptomeningeal Collateral
Growth Was Impaired in db/db Mice
The mean body weight, blood glucose level, and decrease of
cerebral blood flow after CCA occlusion were shown in Figure
I in the online-only Data Supplement. The same degree of cerebral blood flow reduction was observed after CCA occlusion in
both db/+ and db/db mice. In the db/+ mice, there were significant increases in the leptomeningeal collateral vessel diameters in response to CCA occlusion (CCA occlusion, 33.7±1.2
μm, n=5 versus sham, 26.5±1.0 μm, n=5; P<0.05; Figure 1A
and 1B) and infarct size was significantly attenuated, especially in the cerebral cortex (Figure II in the online-only Data
Supplement), in the CCA occlusion group compared with the
sham group (CCA occlusion, 21.2±0.9 mm3, n=7 versus sham,
38.3±3.4 mm3, n=7; P<0.05; Figure 1C and 1D), which was in
agreement with our previous study in normal rodents. In contrast, in the db/db mice, there were no significant differences in
the vessel diameters between the CCA occlusion group and the
sham group (CCA occlusion, 27.9±1.0 μm, n=5 versus sham,
26.6±1.0 μm, n=5; Figure 1A and 1B) and no reductive effect
of infarct size attributed to leptomeningeal arteriogenesis
(CCA occlusion, 34.0±4.1 mm3, n=7 versus sham, 35.7±1.7
mm3, n=7; Figure 1C and 1D).

Leptomeningeal Arteriogenesis Was Not Impaired
in Streptozotocin-Induced Hyperglycemic Mice

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

To investigate the influence of hyperglycemia on leptomeningeal arteriogenesis, we used the streptozotocin-induced
hyperglycemic mice. The mean body weight and blood glucose level were shown in Figure III in the online-only Data
Supplement. The blood glucose levels of the streptozotocininduced hyperglycemic mice were comparable to those of the
db/db mice. In contrast to the db/db mice, there were significant increases in the leptomeningeal collateral vessel diameters (CCA occlusion, 29.1±1.1 μm versus sham, 23.6±0.7
μm; P<0.05; Figure 2A and 2B) and significantly reduced
infarct size in response to CCA occlusion (CCA occlusion,
28.7±2.1 mm3, n=7 versus sham, 40.3±1.9 mm3, n=7; P<0.05;
Figure 2C and 2D) in streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic
mice. This finding suggests that hyperglycemia during cerebral hypoperfusion was not the main cause of impaired arteriogenesis in the db/db mice.

Numbers of Macrophages on the Dorsal Surface of
the Brain Were Significantly Increased 7 Days After
CCA Occlusion in the db/+ Mice But Not in db/db
Mice
We previously demonstrated that the number of macrophages on
the dorsal brain surface was significantly increased 7 days after
CCA occlusion.3,5 In the db/+ mice examined here, the number
of Mac-2–positive cells was significantly increased 7 days after
CCA occlusion (CCA occlusion, 103±7, n=6 versus sham, 76±8,
n=6; P<0.05; Figure 3A and 3B). However, the db/db mice in
the sham group had larger numbers of Mac-2–positive cells than
the db/+ mice in the sham group. However, no reactive increase
of the number of Mac-2–positive cells was observed in the db/db
mice 7 days after CCA occlusion (CCA occlusion, 138±15, n=6
versus sham, 124±9, n=6; Figure 3A and 3B).

TNF-α mRNA Expression in the Cerebral Cortex
Was Significantly Increased 7 Days After CCA
Occlusion in db/+ Mice But Not in db/db Mice
The result of Mac-2 staining suggested that the difference in
macrophage mobilization between db/+ and db/db mice might
contribute to the impaired leptomeningeal collateral growth in
db/db mice. Next, we investigated the mRNA expression of
several macrophage-related factors in the left cerebral cortex,
including leptomeningeal anastomoses in db/+ and db/db mice
using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Baseline mRNA
expression of nitric oxide synthase 2, TNF-α, and arginase-1
was significantly increased in the db/db mice compared with
the db/+ mice (Figure 4A). When viewed from the perspective
of changes over time, expression of some factors increased 7
days after CCA occlusion in db/+ mice. In particular, expression of TNF-α levels was significantly increased in db/+ mice
(Figure 4B), but not in db/db mice (Figure 4C). TNF-α exerts its
biological effects by interacting with 2 different TNF-α receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2). TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were
significantly higher in the db/db mice than in the db/+ mice
(Figure 5A) and were significantly increased 7 days after CCA
occlusion in the db/+ mice (Figure 5B). No significant increases
were observed in the db/db mice, as with TNF-α (Figure 5C).

Preadministration of Etanercept Restored
Leptomeningeal Collateral Growth in the db/db Mice
The results to date suggest the possibility that chronic TNF-α
elevation impaired the TNF-α signaling response in the
brains of the db/db mice. TNF-α protein expression was also
increased in the cerebral cortex of db/db mice compared with
db/+ mice (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).

We hypothesized that the leptomeningeal collateral growth
induced by chronic hypoperfusion could be restored by TNF-α
level normalization before CCA occlusion in the db/db mice
(Figure 6A). We used the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept to reduce
the excess TNF-α signaling. There were no significant differences in the body weights or blood glucose levels before versus after etanercept administration (Figure V in the online-only
Data Supplement). The same degree of cerebral blood flow
reduction was observed after CCA occlusion in db/db mice
both with preadministration of etanercept and vehicle (Figure
V in the online-only Data Supplement). The mean vessel
diameter of the leptomeningeal anastomoses was significantly
increased in the CCA occlusion with preadministration of etanercept group compared with the other groups (CCA occlusion
with preadministration of etanercept, 30.1±1.0 μm, n=6, versus CCA occlusion with vehicle, 26.3±0.8 μm, n=6, versus
sham with preadministration of etanercept, 24.4±0.6 μm, n=6;
P<0.05; Figure 6B). In another set of mice, infarct size was significantly attenuated, especially in the cerebral cortex (Figure
V in the online-only Data Supplement), in the CCA occlusion
with preadministration of etanercept group compared with the
CCA occlusion with vehicle group (vehicle group, 38.0±1.4
mm3, n=8 versus etanercept group, 29.3±3.3 mm3, n=8; P<0.05;
Figure 6C). Neurological functional deficits were significantly
attenuated in the CCA occlusion with preadministration of etanercept group compared with the CCA occlusion with vehicle
group on modified neurological severity score (n=8 per group;

Discussion
In this article, we found that (1) leptomeningeal collateral
growth induced by cerebral hypoperfusion after unilateral CCA
occlusion is impaired in db/db mice; (2) hyperglycemia during

cerebral hypoperfusion is not the main cause of impaired arteriogenesis in db/db mice; (3) no reactive increase of macrophages for unilateral CCA occlusion on the dorsal surface of the
brain is observed in db/db mice; (4) mRNA expression of TNFα was increased most significantly 7 days after CCA occlusion
in db/+ mice, whereas there was no significant change over time
in db/db mice; and (5) the administration of etanercept before
unilateral CCA occlusion restored leptomeningeal collateral
growth in db/db mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report
to demonstrate that cerebral arteriogenesis for chronic hypoperfusion is impaired by diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, we found
that TNF-α is strongly associated with the mechanism for cerebral arteriogenesis impairment and that the leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/db mice can be restored by intervention of
the drug that has been already used in clinical practice.
Unlike angiogenesis, arteriogenesis occurs in response to
increased fluid shear stress, and it exhibits the remodeling and
growth of collateral arterioles from preexisting anastomoses.15
Angiogenesis results in an overall increment of vessel resistance and is insufficient to improve tissue perfusion15; hence,
arteriogenesis is a crucial natural compensatory mechanism
for improving tissue perfusion for occlusive arterial disease.
We previously described that hypertension4 and hypercholesterolemia6 impaired hypoperfusion-induced collateral
growth in the cerebral circulation. In this study, we demonstrated that leptomeningeal arteriogenesis was also impaired
in db/db mice.
Cerebrovascular density and collateralization were reportedly increased in Goto–Kakizaki (GK) rats of a mild and lean
model of diabetes mellitus.16 Different from db/db mice, the
GK rats are a model of mild type 2 diabetes mellitus without confounding factors, such as obesity. That is, this study
investigated the effects of mild hyperglycemia alone on native
leptomeningeal collateral state without inducing hypoperfusion. Another study comparing the native cerebral neovascularization of GK rats and db/db mice showed that the GK rats
had increased microvessel and macrovessel densities, whereas
the db/db mice had increased microvasculature densities and
decreased lumen diameters of the penetrating arterioles.17 Our
results are consistent with those of previous studies in that
hyperglycemia alone does not impair leptomeningeal arteriogenesis and that the arteriole diameters of the db/db mice were
not increased unlike those of the GK rats.
Although the exact molecular mechanisms of arteriogenesis remain largely unclear, several studies and reviews have
demonstrated that macrophages play a pivotal role in this
process.15,18,19 The increased shear stress in the collateral vessels activates the endothelium, where circulating monocytes
adhere via upregulated intracellular adhesion molecule-1,
transmigrate into the perivascular tissue, and mature into
macrophages, producing growth factors and cytokines for
collateral artery growth.20 In this study, we observed a higher
number of macrophages on the dorsal surface of the brain in
the db/db mice than in the db/+ mice without CCA occlusion, and the number of macrophages in the db/db mice did
not change after CCA occlusion, whereas that in the db/+
mice was significantly increased 7 days after CCA occlusion.
We previously reported that the same situation was observed
in spontaneously hypertensive rats.21 These results suggest

key factor of diabetic impairment of leptomeningeal collateral
growth. In this study, some factors, especially TNF-α, showed
an interesting dynamic state of transient increases 7 days after
CCA occlusion in db/+ mice, but not in db/db mice.
TNF-α is closely related to diabetes mellitus. TNF-α plays
a pivotal role in mediating insulin resistance as a result of obesity.22,23 One experimental study showed that plasma concentrations of TNF-α were significantly increased in db/db mice
and that TNF-α induced endothelial dysfunction in db/db
mice.24 In terms of arteriogenesis, earlier studies suggested
that TNF-α is expressed by macrophages around growing collateral arteries25 and that TNF-α functions as a positive modulator for arteriogenesis related to its activation of TNFR1 or
TNFR2.12–14 In the process of arteriogenesis, TNF-α induces
adhesion factors by sustaining inflammation and increasing
monocyte and macrophage recruitment. Furthermore, TNF-α
can activate nuclear factor-κB, and 1 report demonstrated that
endothelial nuclear factor-κB signaling plays a key role in
the regulation of arteriogenesis and the formation of the collateral circulation.26 Accordingly, TNF-α is closely involved
with diabetes mellitus and arteriogenesis. In our results, CCA
occlusion could not stimulate TNF-α signaling in db/db mice.
One mechanism of such an abnormal response might be a
resistant TNF-α state induced by chronically elevated TNF-α
expression. Chronic increases in TNF-α stimulation to the
cerebral vessels might induce resistance to TNF-α signaling
in db/db mice.
To restore the leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/db
mice by reducing TNF-α, we used etanercept, a soluble TNFα receptor. Etanercept is widely used to treat rheumatoid

arthritis and has an established clinical safety profile. Our
result that leptomeningeal collateral growth was restored in
db/db mice by etanercept preadministration strongly suggests
that the impaired leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/db
mice is mainly because of chronic exposure to TNF-α stimulation and downregulated vessel reactivity to the CCA occlusion stimulation.

Conclusions
This is the first report demonstrating that cerebral arteriogenesis for chronic hypoperfusion is impaired by diabetes mellitus.
The impairment is not because of hyperglycemia alone but
rather to chronic TNF-α stimulation to the cerebral vessels.
Reducing TNF-α levels before inducing CCA occlusion can
restore the leptomeningeal collateral growth in db/db mice.
The data suggest that decreasing the responsiveness to TNF-α
signaling is the major factor influencing diabetic impairment
of cerebral arteriogenesis.

Supplemental Methods
CCA Occlusion
We assigned the db/db mice and db/+ mice used here to the left CCA occlusion or sham
groups to examine the effect of diabetes on leptomeningeal collateral growth. The
Streptozotocin (STZ) -induced hyperglycemic mice were also assigned to the two groups to
investigate the influence of hyperglycemia.
General anesthesia was induced with 4.0% isoflurane and maintained at 1.5% isoflurane with
an open facemask, and rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with a
heat lamp and mat. In the occlusion group, the left CCA was exposed and ligated by a silk
suture. In the sham group, the same operation was performed without ligation.
Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)
Changes in surface CBF were monitored using a laser speckle blood flow imaging system
(Omegazone; Omegawave) that obtains high-resolution, two-dimensional images. The CBF
recordings were obtained as described previously1,2,3 with some modifications. The mice
were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and placed in the prone position immediately after
CCA occlusion. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with a heat
lamp and mat. The skull was exposed by a midline scalp incision. The surface of the skull
was moistened with saline to prevent drying. During the CBF measurement, the skull surface
was diffusely illuminated by a 780-nm laser light. The scattered light was filtered and
detected by a charge-coupled device camera positioned over the head. The filter detected only
scattered light that had a perpendicular polarization to the incident laser light. The raw
speckle images were used to calculate the speckle contrast. Signal processing was performed
by the algorithm developed by Forrester et al. 4 Color-coded CBF images were obtained in
high-resolution mode. The regions of interest corresponded with the regions around the
leptomeningeal anastomoses connecting the dorsal branches of the anterior cerebral artery
(ACA) and the MCA. Twenty CBF recordings were averaged and the CBF values were
expressed as percentages of the contralateral (left/right) CBF values.
Streptozotocin (STZ) -induced hyperglycemic mice
C57BL/6 strain mice (11–12 weeks old) were injected with STZ (250mg/kg) intraperitoneally.
One week after the STZ injection, mice with a blood glucose level > 450 mg/dL were chosen
for the experiments.
Visualization of Leptomeningeal Anastomoses by Latex Perfusion
Under deep isoflurane anesthesia, rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 ±
0.5°C with a heat lamp and mat. The right atrium of the heart was incised to enable venous
outflow. The left ventricle of the heart was cannulated and saline (8 × 10-2 mL/mouse・g) was
injected. Immediately after saline injection, latex compound (2 × 10-2 mL/mouse・g, Product
No. 563; Chicago Latex Products Inc) mixed with 50 μL/mL carbon black (Bokusai; Fueki
Inc) was injected at 150 mmHg. The brain was then removed from the skull and immersed in
1

Zamboni solution (2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid) for 2 days. Photographs of
the dorsal brain surface were then taken. The distal MCA was identified from its branch angle
and distinguished from the distal ACA or posterior cerebral artery (PCA).5 The diameter of
each leptomeningeal anastomosis was measured at the point of confluence between the distal
MCA and the distal ACA or PCA in a blinded fashion.
MCA Occlusion Subsequent to CCA Occlusion
Under general anesthesia, the mice were placed in the recumbent position and the skin was
incised longitudinally at the midpoint between the left orbit and the external auditory canal.
The mandible was pulled downward and the left MCA was visualized through the skull. A
small burr hole was made in the skull above the MCA using a dental drill. The MCA was
occluded permanently by electrocoagulation just proximal to the point of olfactory branch
origination. The rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5℃ using a
heat lamp and mat. Operated mice were included if they showed spastic paralysis of the right
forelimb after surgery. Twenty-four hours after the MCA occlusion, the brain was removed
from the skull for infarct volume evaluation. The infarct volume was evaluated in eight
1-mm-thick coronal sections stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium-chloride/saline (TTC).
The infarct area was measured with Image J and the infarct volume was determined by
integration of the infarct areas of the eight sections in a blinded fashion.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed using Mac-2 antibody to assess the degree of macrophage
accumulation on the dorsal surface of the brain 7 days after CCA occlusion (n = 6 in each
group). Sagittal 50-μm-thick sections taken 1.5–3.0 mm lateral of midline were incubated
with Mac-2 antibody (1:200; Cedarlane Laboratories) at 4°C overnight and then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rat immunoglobulin G antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) at room
temperature for 60 minutes. The total number of Mac-2–positive cells accumulating on the
dorsal surface of the brain in 10 slices was counted.
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from the left cerebral cortex including the leptomeningeal
anastomoses using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions, and then cDNA was synthesized using High-capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed for several macrophage-related
factors on a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The cycle times were
normalized to Rn18s of the same sample. The mRNA expression levels were reported as fold
changes versus the sham group levels.
Western Blot
The brain tissue samples were taken from the left cerebral cortex including the
leptomeningeal anastomoses. The samples were homogenized in buffer containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenates were then
2

centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4℃. Brain homogenate supernatants were mixed
with Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and were boiled for 5 minutes.
The protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were incubated with
the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-TNFα antibody (abcam) and mouse anti-β
-actin antibody (Sigma). Proteins were detected using the ECL detection system (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) after incubation with secondary antibodies (GE
Healthcare). Signals were quantified using the Image J.
Etanercept Administration
In the experiment with the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept, we used only db/db mice (12–13
weeks old). The mice were divided into the following three groups: CCA occlusion group
with pre-administration of vehicle (saline); CCA occlusion group with pre-administration of
etanercept; and sham group with pre-administration of etanercept. The CCA surgery was
performed 7 days after the first administration of etanercept or saline. Latex perfusion was
performed 14 days after CCA surgery. Next, we performed the permanent MCA occlusion 14
days after CCA occlusion on different set of db/db mice divided into two groups (CCA
occlusion group with pre-administration of vehicle (saline) and CCA occlusion group with
pre-administration of etanercept). Twenty-four hours after the MCA occlusion, we checked
the functional outcome and infarct volume.
Functional Test
In the experiment with the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept, a battery of behavioral test (modified
Neurological Severity Score [mNSS] )6,7 was performed 24 hours after MCA occlusion by an
investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups. Neurological function was graded
on a scale of 0 to 14 (normal score 0 ; maximal deficit score 14, see supplemental Table I).
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences between multiple groups were compared
by analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Nonparametric data
were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Values of
P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
