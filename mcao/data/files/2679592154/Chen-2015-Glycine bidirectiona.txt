Abstract
The exact effect of glycine pre-treatment on brain ischemic
tolerance (IT) remains quite controversial. The objective of this
study was to investigate the potential effects of glycine on IT.
We used rat models of both in vitro ischemia (oxygen and
glucose deprivation) and in vivo ischemia (transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion). Low doses of glycine (L-Gly)
signiﬁcantly decreased hippocampal ischemic LTP (i-LTP),
infarct volume, and neurological deﬁcit scores which were
administered before ischemia was induced in rats, whereas
high doses of glycine exerted deteriorative effects under the
same condition. These ﬁndings suggested that exogenous
glycine may induce IT in a dose-dependent manner. Further-

It is well established that pre-exposure to several agents can
protect the brain from ischemic insult, a phenomenon known
as ischemic pre-conditioning (IP, is one of brain preconditioning.) or ischemic tolerance (IT) (Kirino 2002;
Dirnagl et al. 2003; Gidday 2006; Papadia and Hardingham
2007; Dirnagl et al. 2009). IT was initially identiﬁed by Dahl
and Balfour (1964) and is not a well-demonstrated strategy in
clinical practice. Cerebral IT was initially identiﬁed in gerbil
hippocampus (Kitagawa et al. 1991), and is now a welldemonstrated strategy in vitro (Kirino 2002; Gidday 2006;
Papadia and Hardingham 2007), in vivo (Gidday 2006; Liu

more, L-Gly-dependent neuronal protection was inversed by
L689, a selective NMDAR glycine site antagonist both in vitro
(abolished i-LTP depression) and in vivo (increased infarct
size reduction), but not glycine receptor (GlyR) inhibitor
strychnine. Importantly, L-Gly-induced IT was achieved by
NR2A-dependent cAMP-response element binding protein
phosphorylation. These data imply that glycine pre-treatment
may represent a novel strategy for inducing IT based on
synaptic NMDAR-dependent neuronal transmission.

et al. 2009), and in clinical practice (Kitagawa et al. 1991;
Dirnagl et al. 2003; 2009). N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) overactivation is believed to be a crucial factor
for ischemic neuronal injury. Accumulating research aims at
developing pharmacological targets with potential neuroprotective properties via IP with NMDAR (Grabb and Choi 1999;
Gonzalez-Zulueta et al. 2000; Mabuchi et al. 2001; Raval et al.
2003) NMDARs are heteromeric complexes consisting of NR1,
NR2A-D, and NR3A-B subunits in the CNS (McBain and
Mayer 1994; Chatterton et al. 2002). NR2A and NR2B are
prominently expressed in the hippocampus (Monyer et al.
1994; Laurie et al. 1997), and play different roles in IT, both
determining the direction of synaptic plasticity (Monyer et al.
1994) and conferring resistance against neuronal death (Chen
et al. 2008; Terasaki et al. 2010). NR2A-containing synaptic
NMDAR, but not NR2B-containing extrasynaptic NMDAR
(Hardingham et al. 2002; Hardingham and Bading 2003,
2010;), is involved in neuroprotection by activating pro-survival
signals and inducing phosphorylation of cAMP-response
element binding protein (CREB) in IP (Lee et al. 2005; Papadia
et al. 2005; Soriano et al. 2006; Tauskela et al. 2008).
As a dual-faceted neurotransmitter, glycine can activate the
glycine receptor (GlyR) site (site A) and the NMDAR
glycine co-agonist site (site B). In contrast to glycineactivated NMDAR-dependent neuronal excitation (PerezOtano et al. 2001; Danglot et al. 2004; Keck and White
2009), high concentration of glycine in the hippocampus
(Chen et al. 2011) can induce extrasynaptic-GlyR-dependent
glycinergic inhibition (Danglot et al. 2004; Xu and Gong
2010). Furthermore, glycine plays critical roles in synaptic
events such as neuronal plasticity (Sheng et al. 1994; Keck
and White 2009; Xu and Gong 2010; Chen et al. 2011) and
in pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia (Liu
et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2012). A novel study reported that
high concentration of glycine exerts neruoprotection by
activating GlyR, whereas low dosage of glycine has deteriorating effect through NMDAR glycine co-agonist site in the
hippocampus in experimental stroke (Yao et al. 2012). The
bidirectional effects of glycine may well explain the previous
inconsistent results on two modulating sites, GlyR (Tanabe
et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010) and NMDAR (Ohtani et al.
2003; Zhao et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2007), in ischemia.
Moreover, recent studies imply that extrasynaptic NMDAR
activation results in down-regulation of CREB and triggers
excitotoxic events in the hippocampus (Hardingham et al.
2002; Hardingham and Bading 2003, 2010). These ﬁndings,
however, make the problem complicated for low levels of
glycine can stimulate both NR2A-containing synaptic
NMDAR and NR2B-containing extrasynaptic NMDAR and
activate both pro-survival and pro-death signals, and it is
highly controversial whether glycine exerts neuronal damage
via synaptic NMDAR (Yao et al. 2012). A reasonable
interpretation of these controversies is that glycine may
function through different mechanisms under different

ischemic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, whether
and how glycine is related to IT is yet to be investigated.
In light of these observations, we hypothesize that synaptic
NMDAR, but not GlyR, may be neuroprotective owing to the
glycine pre-treatment in IT. In this study, we investigate IT
with different doses of glycine in both in vitro (oxygen and
glucose deprivation, OGD) and in vivo ischemic (transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO) models.

Materials and methods
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (3–5 weeks old/50-100 g for OGD
electrophysiology; 7–8 weeks old/300  20 g for tMCAO; Shanghai Super–B&K laboratory animal Corp. Ltd.) were used. All
experiments were performed following the guidelines of the
Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee of the Dongfang
Hospital Afﬁliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University.
Electrophysiology and OGD induction
Rat coronal slices (350 lm thick) were cut using a vibrating blade
microtome. Slices were prepared and maintained for 1 h in artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) (34°C, 2.5–3 mL/min, bubbled with 95%
O2/5% CO2) with composition as follows (in mmol/L): 126 NaCl, 2.5
KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 11 glucose, and 25
NaHCO3. Axopatch-200B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto,
CA, USA) was used to record ﬁeld excitatory post-synaptic potential
(fEPSP) (Costa et al. 2008; Tanabe et al. 2010; Costa et al. 2011). In
the hippocampal CA1 region, slices were bathed with an ACSF
containing 10 lM bicuculline to block GABAA receptors, and
0.3 mM Mg2+ was added to increase NMDAR-mediated responses
and prevent seizures. A bipolar tungsten electrode was positioned in
the Schaffer collaterals to deliver test stimuli. Test synaptic responses
were evoked at 0.05 Hz. Before the onset of OGD ischemia, preconditioning was induced by 8 min glycine bath treatment. As
previously reported (Picconi et al. 2006; Quintana et al. 2006), postischemic LTP (iLTP) was then induced into the hippocampus by a
brief OGD (ACSF sucrose replaced glucose, gassed with 95% N2 and
5% CO2) period (5–10 min) (Picconi et al. 2006; Quintana et al.
2006; Tanabe et al. 2010; Yao et al. 2012). i-LTP was attributable to
energy deprivation because no change was detected when OGD
treatment was not introduced (Supplementary data) (Picconi et al.
2006; Quintana et al. 2006). All the drugs were administered via the
saline solution. Quantitative data were collected by Clampﬁt as a
fEPSP initial slope value counteracted by the control slope value. The
mean value of average response was obtained during a stable period
(5–10 min). The Data were analyzed by pClamp10.2 software and
Clampﬁt 10.2 (Molecular Devices).
The tMCAO surgery, infarct size analysis, and neurological deficit
scores
Animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with chloral hydrate.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion were established
by a method of tMCAO as showed in early reports (Bederson et al.
1986; Aarts et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2012). The
tMCAO was achieved through middle cerebral artery occlusion with
a monoﬁlament suture (4–0 silicone-coated nylon suture) for 1 h.

Glycine regulates ischemic tolerance

Rats were allowed to breathe spontaneously, and rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the experiments. 0.5 h
before the tMCAO, animals were treated with drugs via intraperitoneal injection and then killed 25 h after tMCAO onset (Table 1).
Drugs were administered through saline. Cerebral infarct size was
analyzed using brain coronal sections (2 mm thickness) stained for
20 min with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution
(Liu et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2012). 10 min before the animals were
killed, neurological severity score tests were performed on a 6-grade
scale to assess post-ischemic behavioral deﬁcits (Bederson et al.
1986; Yao et al. 2012).
Western blot analysis
After 24 h of reperfusion, the infarct side of rat hemisphere
(1–5 mm posterior to the bregma and 1–5 mm beside the sagittal
suture) was harvested and assayed for the level of NR2A and
pCREB. The brain tissues were homogenized and centrifuged.
Proteins were electrophoresed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The
samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies (1 : 50, anti-NR2A; 1 : 50, anti-pCREB; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in a solution containing 5%
milk and phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST).
After rinsing with PBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1 : 2000, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG) at
25°C for 1 h. The bands were scanned and quantiﬁed with Scion
Image (Scion, Frederick, Maryland).
Immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining
The rat brains were coronally sectioned (20 lm thick) with cryostat
(CM1900; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The hippocampus sections were prepared for two lines. One was stained by
Nissl for histologic assessment of neuronal loss, and the other was
assayed by immunohistochemistry for the measurement of the
NR2A expression. For the immunohistochemistry, brieﬂy, an ABC
kit (Zhongshan Biotechnology Company, Beijing, China) was used
for primary antibody reactions (30 min at 25°C) and a diaminobenzidine kit (Zhongshan Biotechnology Company) was used for
visualization. The primary antibody was the rabbit polyclonal
antibody against the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 1 : 50 dilution. Finally, the hippocampus cross
sections were mounted on slides and analyzed under a digital
microscope (Leica Microsystems). The Nissl-positive and NR2Apositive neurons in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region were
quantiﬁed (at approximately 3 and 4.5 mm posterior to the
bregma) by Image-Pro software 5.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc.
Shanghai, China and Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA).

Results
Glycine produces dose-dependent biphasic effects on
ischemic tolerance in vivo
To investigate whether neuroprotection and deterioration
were both induced by glycine pre-treatment, we ﬁrst prepared
different doses of glycine before tMCAO operation.
Before being subjected to a 1 h MCAO, rats were
intraperitoneally injected with exogenous low doses of
glycine (L-Gly) (100 mg/kg) or high doses of glycine
(H-Gly) (1000 mg/kg) (Liu et al. 2007; Yao et al. 2012).
The neurological scores and cerebral injuries were assessed
25 h after the tMCAO onset. We observed that L-Gly
remarkably attenuated total infarct size (n = 8, p < 0.01;
Fig. 1a and b) compared with the ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) groups. In contrast, H-Gly enlarged infarct volumes
(n = 8, p < 0.05; Fig. 1a and b) signiﬁcantly in the same
condition. neurological severity scores test showed that LGly reduced neurological behavioral deﬁcits (n = 8,
p < 0.01; Fig. 1c); whereas H-Gly exacerbated neurological
deﬁcits compared with I/R subjects (n = 8, p < 0.05;
Fig. 1c). The overall effect of glycine on in vivo IT was
dose-dependent: L-Gly was neuroprotective, whereas H-Gly
exacerbated the ischemic insult.
Glycine alters iLTP bidirectionally in ischemic preconditioning in vitro
An abnormal electrophysiological phenomenon, named
post-iLTP, was discovered and subsequently demonstrated
as a synaptic sign of glutamate receptor over-excitation in
the hippocampal CA1 region (Crepel et al. 1993a,b; Hsu
and Huang 1997; Dirnagl et al. 1999; Calabresi et al. 2001,
2003; Di Filippo et al. 2008). To ascertain our in vivo
ﬁndings in another cellular model, we carried out recordings of evoked fEPSP and designed a protocol related to IP
in hippocampal CA1 neurons. After 5-min stable baseline
recording (Figure S1), a following 8 min episode of in vitro
ischemia (OGD) persistently enhanced fEPSP slope (n = 6,
p < 0.001, Figs 2a and 3a). This pathological change was
consistent with previous studies on recorded fEPSP form of
iLTP in slices (Pugliese et al. 2003, 2006; Tanabe et al.
2010; Costa et al. 2011).
To elucidate exogenously applied glycine affects iLTP the

application in the hippocampal slices. While L-Gly treatment
signiﬁcantly abolished the iLTP by reducing fEPSP slope
(n = 6, p < 0.001; Fig. 2a–d), pathological LTP was completely facilitated when the concentration of exogenous
glycine increased to 1.0 mM (H-Gly) (n = 6, p < 0.001,
Fig. 3a, b and d) compared with the OGD sample. These
results reﬂected the fact that pre-treatment with glycine can
bidirectionally regulate iLTP induction. Consistent with
Fig. 1, these ﬁndings suggested that L-Gly, but not H-Gly,
has neuroprotective effects in IT.

hypothesize that L-Gly may counteract neuronal death by
NMDAR co-agonist binding site but not strychnine sensitive
GlyR-mediated mechanism, at least, in the condition of IT.
We ﬁrst identiﬁed whether NMDAR co-agonist site (site B)
takes an effect on L-Gly-induced iLTP suppression. L689-560
(L689) is a highly selective NMDAR glycine co-agonist
binding site inhibitor (Chopra et al. 2000; Javitt et al. 2005;
Yao et al. 2012). Bathing L689 (0.5 lM) (Yao et al. 2012)
eliminated the depression of i-LTP (n = 6, p < 0.001; Fig. 2c
and d) compared with L-Gly in OGD treatment (n = 6,
p < 0.001; Fig. 2b and d). These ﬁndings suggested that
NMDAR co-agonist site account for L-Gly attenuative effect
on i-LTP. We then analyzed whether activation of strychnine
sensitive GlyRs (site A) mediates L-Gly effect. Interesting,
strychnine (Stry)-mediated blockade of GlyR (5 lM) (Yao
et al. 2012) (n = 6; Figure S3) did not affect previously
suppressed iLTP compared with L-Gly groups. Hence, our
results revealed that glycine B site but not glycine A site might
account for the anti-ischemic effect of L-Gly in IP.

Pre-treatment with L-Gly protects against neurotoxic
insults via NMDAR glycine co-agonist site but not
strychnine sensitive GlyR
Whether glycine exerts neuroprotection via NMDAR (Zhao
et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2007) glycine co-agonist site or
strychnine sensitive GlyR (Tanabe et al. 2010) has been
controversial. A more controversial ﬁnding claimed that
H-Gly suppresses iLTP by both GlyR and NMDAR activation in ischemic post-conditioning (Yao et al. 2012) owing to
the double site-dependent role of H-Gly (Chen et al. 2011).
However, some argued for the GlyR-inhibitory role of H-Gly
modulating sites and NMDAR-mediated mechanism was
reported in MCAO ischemia (Ohtani et al. 2003). We

H-Gly potentiated iLTP though GlyR in OGD tolerance
To examine the mechanism of H-Gly on iLTP, we
perfused the slices with speciﬁc GlyR antagonist strychnine (stry 5 lM) (Yao et al. 2012). We found that

co-applying stry with H-Gly totally averted the potentiative
effect on iLTP (n = 6, p < 0.01; Fig. 3c and d) compared
with H-Gly groups (n = 6, p < 0.01; Fig. 3a, b and d).
According to the fact that H-Gly has been demonstrated
with physiological afﬁnity of GlyRs (Yao et al. 2012), our
data supported that H-Gly’s effect on ischemia is also
GlyR-dependent. Importantly, we supplied a novel insight
that inhibitory GlyR may worsen neuronal insult in
ischaemic tolerance with H-Gly.
Ischemic tolerance was induced by systematical L-Gly
treatment in tMCAO ischemia
To conﬁrm whether previous ﬁndings on L-Gly in slices
truly reﬂect IT, L-Gly was systemic administered in in vivo
tMCAO model. Compared with I/R animals, L-Gly significantly ameliorated infarct size (n = 8, p < 0.01; Fig. 4a and
b) and behavioral deﬁcits (n = 8, p < 0.01; Fig. 4c). When
L-Gly and L689 were co-injected before tMCAO, infarct
sizes and behavioral deﬁcits were completely reversed
(n = 8, p < 0.05; Fig. 4a–c) compared with the L-Gly
samples. However, co-application of L-Gly and stry failed
to overcome previously reduced brain damage (n = 8, Figure
S4) under the same condition. In contrast to the failure of
GlyR, NMDAR plays a dominant role modulating L-Gly’s
neuroprotection and largely mimics the acute clinical/
subclinical IT.

(a)

Pre-treatment with L-Gly contributed to the expression of
NR2A-containing NMDAR
Accumulating studies have elucidated that NMDAR
subunits – NR2A (synaptic) and NR2B (extrasynaptic)
play critical roles in neuronal survival or death (Hardingham et al. 2002; Hardingham and Bading 2003, 2010). To
investigate whether different NMDAR subtypes are associated with IT and L-Gly’s neuroprotection, we examined
NR2A expression level with both western blot (Fig. 5c
and d) and immunohistochemistry analysis (Fig. 5a and b)
in the hippocampal CA1 region in the L-Gly pre-treated
tMCAO animals. The down-regulation of NR2A caused by
ischemia is less severe (n = 5, p < 0.05; Fig. 5a–d) with
L-Gly pre-conditioning than without. However, enhancements of NR2A-containing NMDAR were totally abolished by co-applying L-Gly and L689 (n = 5, p < 0.05;
Fig. 5a–d) compared with the L-Gly groups. Both
NMDAR and NMDAR subtype NR2A may be activated
in L-Gly-induced IT.
L-Gly-induced ischemic tolerance was NR2A-dependent via
elevating pCREB expression and reducing neuronal loss
NR2A-dependent CREB activation has been demonstrated
in IP (Soriano et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2008; Tauskela
et al. 2008; Terasaki et al. 2010). To ascertain the

Discussion
The three major findings of our investigation are listed
below
First, in contrast to the dual effects found in ischemic postconditioning (Yao et al. 2012), glycine exerts inverted
dichotomy in IT: L-Gly has neuroprotective effect, whereas
H-Gly has deteriorative effect.
Second, pre-treatment with L-Gly promotes NR2A-containing NMDAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and iLTP
reduction. We suggested that L-Gly greatly enhances
network excitation via pharmacological LTP induction,
which in turn activates pro-survival signals in IT.
Third, L-Gly-dependent neuroprotection is mediated by
NMDAR but not GlyR. Blockade of NMDAR via NMDAR
co-agonist site inhibitor L689 abolishes previous neuronal
survival by L-Gly both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast,

(Billups and Attwell 1996). OGD in hippocampal slices is a
well-established model applied mainly in post-ischemia
(Pugliese et al. 2003, 2006; Tanabe et al. 2010; Costa et al.
2011). However, whether and how IT or OGD tolerance can
affect pathological plasticity has not been addressed before.
To reafﬁrm our in vivo results, we designed a new protocol
and obtained solid data via combining administration of
various doses of glycine before OGD induction with patch
clamp recording. Thus, a novel in vitro IT model was set up
by clear observation of altered iLTP after pre-conditioning
with stimuli.

Pathological plasticity in ischemic tolerance
Glutamate-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely
accepted as the major cellular mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity, learning and memory (Malenka and Nicoll
1999; Malenka and Bear 2004). A pathological phenomenon,
named post-iLTP, was discovered in glutamate receptordependent neurotransmission after ischemia in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (Crepel et al. 1993a,b; Hsu
and Huang 1997; Dirnagl et al. 1999; Calabresi et al. 2001,
2003; Di Filippo et al. 2008). This abnormal iLTP was
mainly attributed to long-term synaptic enhancement of
glutamate receptor-mediated over-excitation by excessively
released extracellular glutamate in the post-ischemic brain

Inducing excitation by protective dose of glycine
Glycine is a well-documented bioactive agent; however,
results still show its apparent discrepancy under cerebral
ischemia. Some researchers have found that glycine is

Glycine regulates ischemic tolerance

excitotoxic and contributes to neuronal death (Patel et al.
1990; Newell et al. 1997; Shimizu-Sasamata et al. 1998;
Oda et al. 2007). In contrast, other results showed that
glycine protects neurons in ischemia (Ohtani et al. 2003;
Zhao et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2007; Tanabe et al. 2010).
Although H-Gly was reported to be neuroprotective (Zhao
et al. 2005), more ﬁndings showed that L-Gly instead of HGly is related to the neuronal survival (Ohtani et al. 2003;
Liu et al. 2007; Oda et al. 2007). These observations
contradict in relation to the protective dose of glycine,
L-Gly, or H-Gly. To address this question, Yao et al. (2012)
revealed that H-Gly is neuroprotective against cerebral
ischemia via both GlyR and NMDAR. They claimed that
H-Gly achieves neuropretection by inducing GlyR-dependent Long-term depression (LTD) (Chen et al. 2011) and
scaling NMDAR overactivation (Chen et al. 2011; Zhang
et al. 2014). At this moment, however, we do not exclude the
possibility that L-Gly is also neuroprotective in some
situation. On the basis of these ﬁndings, we found that LGly pre-treatment attenuated iLTP and reduced neuronal
death through activating NMDAR. It is not surprising that
neuronal excitation may exacerbate post-ischemic injury but
not IP. Growing evidence supports the notion that enhanced
electrical synaptic activity effectively combats neuronal
insults in ischemia (Fujiki et al. 2004; Ogita et al. 2005;
Youssef et al. 2006; Tauskela et al. 2008). At the same time,
it was demonstrated that L-Gly itself can induce NMDARdependent LTP (Tauskela et al. 2008). Importantly, IT was
successfully mediated by NMDAR activation from exogenous low level of NMDA both in vitro (Soriano et al. 2006)
and in vivo (Saleh et al. 2009) in the hippocampus. Thus, LGly’s neuroprotection in our research is probably induced by
a short-term hypoxic pre-conditioning-like experience results
to elevated synaptic excitation, reformed endogenous neurovascular plasticity and subsequent reduction in post-ischemic
insult (Wegener et al. 2004; Stowe et al. 2011). Moreover, a
widely accepted theory illustrated that stimulation synaptic or
Global-NMDAR-induced neural protection or neuronal
death, respectively (Lai et al. 2014). Our data strongly
corroborate the hypothesis by Yao et al. (Yao et al. 2012)
that synaptic-NMDAR activation by L-Gly is neurotoxic in
the development of cerebral ischemia.
GlyR mediates neuron damage by H-Gly
According to the dual role of glycine (Xu and Gong 2010), a
recent study indicated that the dose of the glycine is the key
factor determining the direction of the modulation site-L-Gly
expresses high afﬁnity with NMDAR, whereas, H-Gly may
activate GlyR (Chen et al. 2011). A subsequent report
suggested that the selectively binding feature of glycine in
physiological condition can also be replaced in a pathological
condition-cerebral ischemia post-conditioning (Yao et al.
2012). We found, however, pre-treatment with H-Gly was
contributed to the neuronal death, and this H-Gly’s affect can

405

be reversed by application of GlyR antagonist Stry. It is
evident that there are still a gap about GlyR properties in
ischemia between our results and previous ﬁndings (Tanabe
et al. 2010; Yao et al. 2012). A possible explanation is that
post-conditioning with H-Gly exerts neuroprotection via
extrasynaptic GlyR which may regulate an anti-ischemic
signaling, whereas, pre-conditioning with H-Gly induces
neuronal injury by synaptic GlyR which may be responsible
for pro-death downstream effects. Further researches are
required for investigating downstream mechanism of synaptic and extrasynaptic GlyR in the IP and post-conditioning,
respectively.
L-Gly activates NR2A-containing synaptic NMDAR
It is well established that NR2A-containing synaptic
NMDAR and NR2B-containing extrasynaptic NMDAR
mediate neuronal survival and death, respectively (Hardingham et al. 2002; Hardingham and Bading 2003, 2010).
According to our results, L-Gly pre-conditioning elevates
NR2A-dependent pCREB expression, whereas NR2B signaling was not altered apparently. Although down-regulation
of NR2B may occur in some situation (Yao et al. 2012), our
ﬁndings match well with the widely accepted argument that
NR2A is responsible for survival gene expression such as
CREB especially in IP (Zhao et al. 2005; Soriano et al.
2006; Chen et al. 2008; Tauskela et al. 2008; Terasaki et al.
2010; Yao et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2014). A noticeable
issue is that L-Gly did contribute to post-ischemic neuronal
death (Yao et al. 2012). A reasonable explanation of this
inconsistency is that synaptic NMDAR-dependent transmission mildly activated by L-Gly may overcome the extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent signaling dominate the network
transmission in IT. Therefore, our investigation provided a
novel strategy targeting ischemia and settled the problem
balancing neuronal excitation/inhibion between synaptic and
extrasynaptic NMDAR (Soriano et al. 2006; Yao et al.
2012; Lai et al. 2014; Stetler et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014).
Several lines of evidence also suggest that in vivo synaptic
NMDARs are responsible for causing neuronal death under
ischemic conditions. Based on these points, it may be
assumed that L-Gly may not reach synaptic NMDARs
because of gycine transportor 1 action, but can easily activate
extrasynaptic GlyR, while, on the contrary, H-Gly will
enhance synaptic NMDARs activity and promote cell death.
Together with the above data, this simple reasoning may give
an alternative explanation for our results.
Thus, our research has clariﬁed that L-Gly contributes to
IT by stimulating no GlyR but NR2A-containing synaptic
NMDAR and CREB-regulated genes. Developing antiischemia therapy is related to strengthening synaptic connectivity, inhibiting NMDAR over-excitation and combating
cell death signaling. However, synaptic experience, especially mild activation of synaptic NMDAR, should be
considered as a key factor promoting neuronal survival.
