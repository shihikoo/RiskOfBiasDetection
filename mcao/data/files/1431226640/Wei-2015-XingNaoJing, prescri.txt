Abstract
Background: Xingnaojing (XNJ), a well known prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for
treatment of stroke in China. However, the effects and mechanisms of XNJ on autophagy are not clear. Here, we
used the cell models of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and ischemia stroke in rats to further
investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy.
Methods: We used the cell model of autophagy induced by serum-free condition and the rat model of ischemia
caused by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The effects of XNJ on p53 transcriptional activity of PC12 cells
were evaluated by the luciferase activity assay. The mRNA levels and the expression of p53 and its target autophagy
gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) were analyzed respectively by Quantitative-RTPCR and
Western blot assay. The activation of autophagy was detected by the levels of autophagy markers, microtubule
associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 by Immunofluorescence and Western blot. p53 inhibitor was used to
determine whether p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing autophagy.
Results: The assay for luciferase activity of p53 promoter indicated that XNJ inhibited p53 transcriptional activity.
XNJ reduced the expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator)
in serum-free condition PC12 cells and the cortex in MCAO rats. XNJ reduced autophagy of PC12 cells induced by
serum-free condition and the cortex in MCAO rats. Furthermore, suppression of p53 by p53 inhibitor significantly
reduced the effects of XNJ on the autophagy of PC12 cells in serum-free condition.
Conclusion: XNJ prevents autophagy in experimental stroke by repressing p53/DRAM pathway. Our findings are
therefore of considerable therapeutic significance and provide the novel and potential application of XNJ for the
treatment of brain diseases.

Background
Autophagy, which plays key roles in the digestion of
most cytosolic and aggregated or misfolded proteins in
brain [1], plays an important part in both cell survival
and cell death [2]. Many studies have shown that autophagy is the predominant mode of neuronal death in
stroke [3–5]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the
mechanisms underlying the prevention of autophagy associated with such destructive diseases. p53 is a tumor
suppressor protein that activates transcriptional programs under various types of cellular stress [6]. A link
between autophagy and the regulation of p53 processing
has been suggested, the regulation of p53 represents a
crucial step in the molecular cascade of events leading
to autophagy. p53 in the regulation of autophagy is controlled by its subcellular localization [7]. Nuclear p53
stimulates autophagy in a transcription-dependent fashion [8, 9], while cytoplasmic p53 protein represses autophagy in a transcription-independent way [10].
Recently, DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator) is a lysosomal protein that is not only a new p53 target which modulates autophagy, but also for p53’s ability
to induce programmed cell death [8]. Consequently, it
has been proposed that p53 is an important pharmacological target of intersection for autophagy.
XingNaoJing (XNJ), is one of a hundred traditional
Chinese medicinal (TCM) agents used clinically in China
for the treatment of stroke, and has approval from the
Chinese National Drug Administration [11]. XNJ consists of four Chinese herbs: Moschus, a dry substance secreted by a gland in the sub-umbilical sac of the male
musk deer; Radix Curcumae, the dried roots of Curcuma
aromatica Salisb and C. zedoaria (Berg) Rosc., family
Zingiberaceae; Fructus Gardeniae, the fruit of Gardenia
jasminoides Ellis var. radicans (Thunb.) Makino, family
Rubiaceae; and crystals from the evaporated exudate of
the trunk of Dryobalanops aromatica Gaertn. f., family
Dipterocarpceae. Clinical trials have reported that XNJ
can reduce brain injury and enhance functional recovery
after stroke [12]. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that XNJ has neuroprotective effects in cell and
animal models of stroke [13, 14]. Recent studies have
shown the neuroprotective effect of a herb pair of XNJ
on ischemia stroke in rats [15]. However, the effects and
mechanisms of XNJ on the autophagy are not clear.
Here, we used the cell models of autophagy induced by
serum-free condition and ischemia stroke in rats to further investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy.

Methods
Animals and materials

Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were obtained from the animal centre of Guangzhou University of Chinese

Culture of PC12 cells

Partially differentiated PC12 cells provided by Shanghai
Cellular Institute of China Scientific Academy (Shanghai,
China), originated from rat pheochromocytoma, were
grown to confluence in containing DMEM (1000 mg/l
glucose) supplemented with 5 % FBS, 10 % horse serum,
and a mixture of 1 % of penicillin/streptomycin/nystatin.
Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humid 5 %
CO2/ 95 % air environment. PC12 cells were differentiated with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 7 days.
Cell transfection and assay for luciferase activity

For luciferase activity assays, PC12 cells were transfected
with p53 promoter reporter construct by Lipofectamine
2000 regent, plasmid for pRL-TK was cotransfected to
normalize the variations in transfection efficiency, and
then stimulated with serum or serum-free condition for
6, 12, 24 and 36 h respectively. PC12 cells were transfected with p53 promoter reporter construct and then
stimulated with serum or serum-free condition for 12 h
in the absence or presence of pifithrin α at 0.5, 5 and
50 μM or XNJ at 50 μl/ml and 150 μl/ml. 10 μl of cell
lysate was assayed first for firefly luciferase and then for
Renilla luciferase activity. The absolute values of firefly
luminescence were normalized to those of Renilla, and
the ratios were presented as the relative luciferase units
(RLU).
The cell models of autophagy induced by serum-free
condition were used. PC12 cells were cultured in serumfree condition and stimulated with p53 inhibitor in the
absence or presence of XNJ for 48 h, the levels of p53
and its target autophagy gene DRAM (damage-regulated
autophagy modulator) mRNA were analyzed by

Quantitative-RTPCR. Western blot assay was performed
to detect the autophagy activity, levels of LC3 and p62
proteins. Since both the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I and the
amount of LC3-II could be used to monitor autophagosome formation, LC3-II (approximately 16 kDa) was
used for densitometry quantitation in our study.

The percentage of positive cells was assessed as the ratio
of positive cells to total cells in the fields.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model and treatment
schedules

As described previously, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in adult male Sprague–
Dawley rats (280–300 g) using the intraluminal filament
technique [16]. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10 % chloral hydrate at a dose of
0.33 mL/100 g. A midline neck incision was made; the
right common carotid artery and external carotid artery
were isolated. A nylon filament was inserted into the
middle cerebral artery and maintained for 120 min. Reperfusion was achieved by withdrawing the suture after
120 min of occlusion. After operation, rats were transferred to a temperature-controlled chamber to maintain
body temperature at 37.5 °C. 1 h after reperfusion (0 d),
rats were scored for neurological function according to a
scoring system reported by Longa [16]. After neurological evaluation of MCAO rats, treatment schedules
were performed.
MCAO rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n =
30/per group): MCAO + vehicle group, MCAO + XNJ
1 ml/day and MCAO + XNJ 3 ml/day. XNJ was administered by vein injection after 2 h of reperfusion and again
administrated with the same dosage daily for 1 day. The
MCAO group received the same volume of vehicle.
After the treatment of XNJ for 1 day, brains were removed and placed on ice. Seven brains were removed
and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin phosphate for 24 to
48 h for paraffin embedding. Serial coronal frontal cortex sections (5 μm) were cut and every tenth section was
systematically assigned to a series of sections, yielding a
total of 10 series. One series of sections was saved for
LC3 immunohistochemical analysis. For PCR and
Western blot analysis, six ipsilateral cortices were rapidly removed and placed on ice. The cortices were
stored at −80 °C for analysis.
Immunofluorescence

Immunofluorescence for LC3 was conducted following a
two-step protocol. Briefly, slides from cultured PC12
cells and coronal frontal cortex sections of MCAO rats
were successively incubated with LC3 antibody and the
second antibody (FITC-conjugated IgG). Subsequently,
the sections were incubated with propidium iodide. The
control, with the identical procedure, was stained with
non-immune serum instead of the primary antibody.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction analysis

RNA was isolated as a standard protocol for quantitative
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cells were synchronized overnight in
serum-free condition and then were stimulated with a
different dose of XNJ, ranging 50–150 μl/ml for 48 h.
After stimulation, cells were washed with PBS and total
cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. 5 μl of the total RNA was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA (RT-PCR reagent, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and was amplified by fluorescent quantity PCR using the ABI PRISM 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). The fluorescent quantity PCR condition
was a pre-denaturation at 93 °C for 2 min, then 40–45
cycles of 93 °C for 45 s and 55 °C for 1 min.
Western blot analysis

Proteins extracted from cultured PC12 cells, as well as
the cortices of MCAO rats were separated by 10 %
SDS–PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, California, USA). The blot was probed
with LC3, p62, p53 and DRAM antibody respectively,
followed by a second antibody labeled with horseradishperoxidase at room temperature for 90 min. Bands were
visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Densitometry
quantitation was used to analyze with ImageJ Software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Data analysis

All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM) for each group. Analysis of variance was carried out using SPSS 10.0 for Windows software. Effects
were considered to be significant at P values less than 0.05.

Results
XNJ inhibits p53 transcriptional activity

Serum-free condition induced the p53 transcriptional activity. PC12 cells were transfected with p53 promoter reporter construct and then stimulated with serum or
serum-free condition for 6, 12, 24 and 36 h respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1a, increase in p53 promoter activity of
PC12 cells in the serum-free condition was observed at
12 h, 24 h and 36 h, but not 6 h, suggesting that serumfree condition increases the p53 promoter activity in a
time dependent manner. We evaluated the dose effects
of p53 inhibitor on the p53 promoter activity of PC12
cells. PC12 cells were transfected with p53 promoter

pifithrin α, inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. PC12 cells were transfected with p53 promoter reporter construct and then stimulated with serum

reporter construct and then stimulated with serum or
serum-free condition for 12 h in the absence or presence
of p53 inhibitor, pifithrin α. As shown in Fig. 1b, pifithrin α inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in a dose
dependent manner. We also evaluated the dose effects
of XNJ on the p53 promoter activity of PC12 cells. As
seen in Fig. 1c, increase in p53 promoter activity of
PC12 cells in the serum-free condition was reduced by
XNJ in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that XNJ
inhibits p53 transcriptional activity.

XNJ reduced the expression of p53 in serum-free condition
PC12 cells

To further test the effects of XNJ on the p53 expression
of PC12 cells in serum-free condition, PC12 cells were
treated with serum or serum-free condition for 48 h in
the absence or presence of XNJ. As shown in Fig. 2a, increase in p53 mRNA of PC12 cells in the serum-free
condition was observed at 48 h, suggesting that serumfree condition increases the p53 mRNA. In contrast, the
p53 mRNA expression was attenuated in the serum-free

density of p53/β-actin band among the experimental groups was compared. Data are mean ± SEM of values obtained from three independent
experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with serum-free condition

condition treated with XNJ in a dose-dependent manner.
As Western blot analysis shown in the Fig. 2b,c, when
PC12 cells were treated in serum-free condition alone,
the expression of P53 increased remarkably; while XNJ
at low concentration (50 μl/ml) decreased p53 levels,
and this decrease was further enhanced by high concentration (150 μl/ml), suggesting that XNJ elicits a dosedependent reduce in p53 levels.
XNJ inhibits p53 target autophagy gene in serum-free
condition PC12 cells

To demonstrate the involvement of p53 in autophagy activity of XNJ, measurement of autophagy gene DRAM
mRNA expression, target gene of p53 was performed.
RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that treatment of PC12

cells with XNJ significantly decreased the DRAM mRNA
expression, compared with the level observed in serumfree condition (Fig. 3a). In order to further characterize
the effects of XNJ, we examined the changes in DRAM
level. Western blot analysis was performed at 48 h after
the PC12 cells in serum-free condition were treated to
measure the DRAM expression (Fig. 3b). The group of
the PC12 cells in serum-free condition treated with vehicle showed a robust increase in the expression of
DRAM. In contrast, the DRAM expression was attenuated by XNJ. As shown in the Fig. 3c, XNJ treatment significantly reduced the DRAM expression level in the
PC12 cells in serum-free condition (from 1.53 ± 0.4 % to
1.10 ± 0.3 % and 0.90 ± 0.2 %), compared with the group
treated with vehicle (P < 0.05). Taken together, these

results suggest that XNJ reduced DRAM expression of
the PC12 cells in serum-free condition.
XNJ reduced autophagy of the PC12 cells in serum-free
condition

To explore the effects of XNJ on autophagy, LC3 was
used to identify autophagy. There was an increase in
LC3-positive cells of PC12 cells in serum-free condition,
whereas PC12 cells in serum-free condition treated with
XNJ showed very few LC3-positive cells. Quantitative
analysis of LC3-positive cells (Fig. 4a) revealed that LC3positive cells in the serum-free condition reduced from
56 ± 2.4 % in the group treated with vehicle to 28 ±
1.9 %, 16 ± 2.2 % in the group treated with XNJ. We examined the changes in LC3 levels. Western blot analysis
was performed at 48 h after the PC12 cells in serum-free
condition were treated to measure the LC3 expression
(Fig. 4b). The group of the PC12 cells in serum-free

condition treated with vehicle showed a robust increase
in the expression of LC3-II. In contrast, the LC3-II expression was attenuated in the PC12 cells in serum-free
condition treated with XNJ. As shown in the Fig. 4b, the
XNJ treatment significantly reduced the LC3-II expression level of the PC12 cells in serum-free condition
(from 1.31 ± 0.8 to 1.0 ± 0.6 and 0.8 ± 0.4), compared
with the group treated with vehicle (P < 0.05). To further
examine the effects of XNJ on autophagy flux, western
blot analysis was performed to measure the p62 levels.
The group of the PC12 cells in serum-free condition
treated with vehicle showed a robust decrease in p62
levels. In contrast, a significant accumulation of p62 protein was seen in the PC12 cells in serum-free condition
treated with XNJ (Fig. 4b), suggesting that autophagy
flux was reduced by XNJ. Taken together, these results
suggest that XNJ reduced autophagy of the PC12 cells in
serum-free condition.

levels of LC3 and p62 were analyzed using Western blot assay (left panel). The density of LC3-II and p62/β-actin band was compared among the

p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing
autophagy

To determine whether p53 played a role in the effects of
XNJ on autophagy, PC12 cells were cultured in serumfree condition and stimulated with p53 inhibitor in the
absence or presence of XNJ, the expression levels of LC3
and p62 were analyzed using Western blot assay. p53 inhibitor efficiently reduced LC3-II and increased p62 protein expression of the PC12 cells in serum-free
condition (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, suppression of p53 by

p53 inhibitor significantly reduced the effects of XNJ on
the LC3-II and p62 expression of PC12 cells in serumfree condition (Fig. 5b). This suggests that p53 is responsible for the effects of XNJ on preventing autophagy of
PC12 cells in serum-free condition.
XNJ attenuates autophagy induced by cerebral ischemia

To explore the effects of XNJ on autophagy induced by
cerebral ischemia, LC3 staining was used to identify autophagy cells in the parietal cortex 1 d after MCAO.

There was an increase in LC3-positive cells in the group
of MCAO rats treated with vehicle, whereas brain sections from the MCAO rats treated with XNJ showed
very few LC3-positive cells. Quantitative analysis of
LC3-positive cells (Fig. 6a) revealed that LC3-positive
cells in the ischemic cortex reduced from 52 ± 3.1 % in
the group of MCAO rats treated with vehicle to 24 ±
2.7 %, 13 ± 2.9 % in the group of MCAO rats treated
with XNJ. These results suggest that the increase in
LC3-positive cells in the ischemic cortex was inhibited
by XNJ. In order to further characterize the antiautophagy effects of XNJ, we examined the changes in

LC3 and p62. The Western blot analysis was performed
1 d after ischemia to measure LC3 and p62 levels. The
group of MCAO rats treated with vehicle showed a robust increase of LC3-II and reduction of p62 in the ischemic cortex. In contrast, LC3-II was attenuated and
p62 was increased in the group of MCAO rats treated
with XNJ (Fig. 6b). The quantitative analysis revealed
that XNJ significantly decreased LC3-II and increased
p62 levels after MCAO compared with the group of
MCAO rats treated with vehicle (Fig. 6c). These results
suggest that XNJ inhibited autophagy induced by cerebral ischemia.

XNJ inhibited p53 and DRAM expression induced by

To determine whether the anti-autophagy activity of
XNJ correlates with the expression of p53 and DRAM in
a rat MCAO model, we examined the effect of XNJ on
expression of p53 and its downstream effector DRAM in

the ischemic cortex 1 d after MCAO. As shown in
Fig. 7a, Real-time RT-PCR assay showed that XNJ significantly decreased the mRNA expression of p53 in the
ischemic cortex after MCAO compared with the group
of MCAO rats treated with vehicle. Western blot analysis demonstrated that XNJ significantly decreased the

expression of p53 and DRAM in the ischemic cortex
after MCAO compared with the group of MCAO rats
treated with vehicle (Fig. 7b). The quantitative analysis
revealed that XNJ significantly decreased p53 and
DRAM levels compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 7c).
These results suggest that XNJ inhibited p53 and DRAM
induced by cerebral ischemia.

Discussion
Although previous studies suggest that XNJ is protective,
the effects and mechanisms of XNJ on the autophagy

have yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to
further investigate whether the p53-DRAM pathway is
involved in the effects of XNJ on autophagy. The major
findings of the present study were: (1) XNJ prevents autophagy in experimental stroke. (2) The inhibition of autophagy via p53-DRAM signaling pathway is an
important mechanism of protection by XNJ. These findings suggest that the dysfunction of the p53 could be a
causative event leading to the autophagy, and that p53DRAM signaling might be a key target for drug development and anti-autophagy therapy. The intervention of

Wei et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:377

Page 11 of 12

p53-DRAM signaling by pharmacological agents may
represent a targeted and mechanism-based therapeutic
strategy against brain damage following stroke.
An important finding revealed by the current study is
that XNJ has an anti-autophagy effect. Starvation is the
most commonly studied condition that induces autophagy [17]. To study the mechanism of autophagy, we
established an autophagy model induced by serum-free
condition, in which the PC12 cells were exposed to
serum-free media 2 days. In serum-free condition, the
autophagy was detected by a significant change of autophagy markers, including LC3, which is closely correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation [18]
and p62, which is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3 and efficiently
degraded by autophagy [19]. In addition, we have found
that in this model, gene expression of the autophagy was
up-regulated, consistent with the notion that the DRAM
family proteins predetermine the susceptibility of the cell
to a given autophagic and apoptotic stimulus [8]. These
observations indicate that autophagy induced in serumfree condition and cerebral ischemia could serve as
an effective model system for screening potential
agents in research. These results are in keeping with
previous studies indicating that the serum-deprived
PC12 cells show both autophagic and apoptotic features [20]. Recent evidence suggests that excessive autophagy results in neuronal cell damage [21–23]. This
study describes the anti-autophagy effects of XNJ, in
serum-free condition and cerebral ischemia, characterized by the reduction of LC3 and the up-regulation of
p62. The inhibition of autophagy by XNJ improves
cell survival, which provides a novel explanation for
the protective effects of XNJ that benefit the nervous
system.
An important mechanism revealed by the current
study is that p53-DRAM signaling pathway is involved
in the effects of XNJ on autophagy. p53 is a key regulator of cellular response to various stresses [6], and it performs its function primarily as a transcription factor,
controlling the expression of a number of target genes
[24]. Recent studies have shown that p53 has a dual role
in the regulation of autophagy [7, 25], acting as a
positive regulator of autophagy via its transcriptional
activity and as a negative regulator of autophagy via
its cytoplasmic functions [26]. Thus, the present work
for the hypothesis that XNJ may regulate the p53
transcriptional activity was obtained by examining luciferase activity of p53 promoter. In agreement with
our results, as positive control, pifithrin α, which is a
synthetic inhibitor of p53-induced transcriptional activiation [27], also inhibits p53 transcriptional activity.
As a transcription factor, p53 transactivates autophagy
inducers DRAM. Our data provided by RT-PCR and

Western blot analysis showed that XNJ reduced the
expression of p53 and its target autophagy gene
DRAM in serum-free condition PC12 cells and cerebral ischemia. Consistent with down-regulation of p53
and DRAM, we observed the anti-autophagy effect of
XNJ on PC12 cells in serum-free condition and cerebral ischemia. To further determine the role of p53
transcriptional activity in the anti-autophagy effect of
XNJ, our experiments with suppression of p53 transcriptional activity by p53 inhibitor have provided
more direct evidence showing that the alteration of
p53 transcriptional activity induced by serum-free and
cerebral ischemia causally links to the autophagy and
anti-autophagy effects of XNJ depending on p53DRAM signaling pathway.
The present study has several important clinical implications. First, since excessive activation of autophagy
contributes to neuronal death in cerebral ischemia [5], it
promotes attractiveness for anti-autophagy therapy.
Current study suggests that the autophagy should be a
new target in the treatment of cerebral ischemia [28].
Thus, XNJ with anti-autophagy activity can be applied
for therapies in stroke. Second, some reports showed
that p53-DRAM signaling pathway has been associated
with cell death [29], and that p53 inhibitor administration may be effective in the treatment of an animal
model of stroke [30]. Current report suggests that targeting the p53 pathway represents a potential novel neuroprotective strategy to combat ischemic brain [31].
Hence, regulation of p53 signaling by XNJ may provide
a new approach to the treatment of brain diseases.
Third, our previous report showed that XNJ contained
some small molecules including muscone, borneol and
camphor [32], unlike large molecule agents, such as
therapeutic antibodies or neurotrophic factors lack of
transport across blood brain barrier [33]. There comes
an innate advantage for XNJ to become therapeutic
agents for brain diseases. Our findings are therefore of
considerable therapeutic significance and provide the
novel and potential application of XNJ for the treatment
of brain diseases.
Since XNJ has various active ingredients, such as
muscone which has been shown to exert neuroprotection via FAS pathway [32], it exerts the antiautophagy effect through a multi-component and
multi-target way. Furthermore, XNJ could act through
a number of different mechanisms since p53 is involved in a number of cellular processes leading to
cell death. Therefore autophagy prevention via p53DRAM pathway is an important but not the only
mechanism of protection by XNJ. Further studies are
required in extension of the present observations in
order to investigate other significant mechanisms regarding XNJ in the inhibition of autophagy.

Conclusions
Our study suggests: (1) XNJ has an anti-autophagy effect; (2) The inhibition of autophagy via p53-DRAM signaling pathway is an important mechanism of protection
by XNJ; (3) The intervention of p53-DRAM signaling by
key components of pharmacological agents in this
pathway may represent a targeted and mechanismbased therapeutic strategy against brain damage following stroke.
