Ischemia occurs in diabetic retinopathy with neuronal loss, edema, glial cell reactivity and oxidative stress. Epacs, consisting
of Epac1 and Epac2, are cAMP mediators playing important roles in maintenance of endothelial barrier and neuronal functions.
To investigate the roles of Epacs in the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathy, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) was performed on Epac1-deficient (Epac1) mice, Epac2-deficient (Epac2) mice, and their wild type counterparts (Epac1+/+ and Epac2+/+). Two-hour occlusion and 22-hour reperfusion were conducted to induce ischemia/reperfusion
injury to the retina. After tMCAO, the contralateral retinae displayed similar morphology between different genotypes. Neuronal loss, retinal edema and increase in immunoreactivity for aquaporin 4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6) were observed in ipsilateral retinae. Epac2 ipsilateral retinae showed more neuronal loss in retinal
ganglion cell layer, increased retinal thickness and stronger immunostaining of AQP4, GFAP, and Prx6 than those of Epac2+/+.
However, Epac1 ipsilateral retinae displayed similar pathology as those in Epac1+/+ mice. Our observations suggest that
Epac2-deficiency led to more severe ischemic retinopathy after retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Ischemia occurs in several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and central retinal artery occlusion [1]. Dysfunction of retinal capillary is the major
cause of retinal ischemia. Deprivation of blood supply induces a series of pathophysiological changes in the retina.

vation is evident by up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) in response to deleterious release of glutamate from over excited neurons after ischemia [6,7]. Retinal
edema also occurs, because of the increased water transportation and accumulation as a result of increased extracellular
fluid volume, increased aquaporin 4 (AQP4) immunoreactivity and swelling of retinal glial cells [8,9]. Oxidative
stress is present under ischemic condition, which further
exacerbates the progression of retinopathy [10,11].

Exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epacs),
consisting of Epac1 and Epac2, are cAMP mediators independent of protein kinase A (PKA). As a mediator of cAMP,
an important second messenger for intracellular signal
transduction, Epacs take part in many biological functions
(reviewed in [12]). Epac1 is involved in the maintenance of
cell-cell junctions [13]. The activation of Epac1 reduces the
permeability of endothelial cells in vitro [14]. Epac2 participates in the modulation of neuronal activities, including
neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity [1517].
Both Epac1 and Epac2 are expressed in the brain [18], and
retina [19], which is part of central nervous system (CNS)
and can be viewed using non-invasive methods.
Therefore, we determine the molecular significance of
Epac in retinal neurons and in the pathogenesis of ischemic
retinopathy using the Epac1-deficient (Epac1) and
Epac2-deficient (Epac2) mice under transient ischemic
retinopathy condition. Here, we report that, after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), more severe
ischemic retinopathy was observed in the ipsilateral retinae
of Epac2 mice when compared with that of Epac2+/+ mice,
whereas there was no obvious difference in retinae of
Epac1and Epac1+/+ mice.

1 Materials and methods
1.1

Animals

All animals used in this study were housed in a temperature-controlled room with diurnal light conditions and allowed access to food and water freely in the Laboratory
Animal Unit of The University of Hong Kong.
Epac1 mice were generated previously [20], and they
were backcrossed to C57BL/6N mice for more than 10
generations. Age-matched Epac1+/+ littermates served as the
control group. Epac2 mice were backcrossed to
C57BL/6N mice for more than 10 generations (a kind gift
from Prof. S. Seino of Kobe University); thus they were
considered congenic with C57BL/6N mice. C57BL/6N
mice were therefore used as the control group (Epac2+/+) for
Epac2 mice as in previous publication [21]. Three to six
animals were included in each group.
1.2

Genotyping of Epac1- and Epac2-deficient mice

Genomic DNA was extracted from tail biopsy of each
mouse. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the genotype of each mouse. The sequences of primers
used are as follows: Epac1 (forward) 5′-GTTCTGCTCTTTGAACCACACAGCAA-3′, Epac1 (reverse1) 5′-AGAACTCAATCACAGCCTGTCCCTACC-3′, and Epac1 (reverse2)
5′-ATCAGCAGCCTCTGTTCCAC-3′, for Epac1 genotyping; Epac2 (forward1) 5′-TGTGATAAACATTCTCGATT3′, Epac2 (forward2) 5′-GCATACATTATACGAAGT-

TATC-3′, and Epac2 (reverse) 5′-CTGATCACATTAGCAAGCTC-3′ for Epac2 genotyping. The genotyping was
performed in a 50 μL PCR reaction system, and the annealing temperatures were 58°C and 51°C for Epac1 and Epac2,
respectively. The PCR products were loaded to a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide for electrophoresis. The
bands for PCR products were visualized under ultraviolet
light. For Epac1 genotyping, bands with two sizes could be
seen: the upper 360 bp band indicated Epac1+/+, and the
lower 260 bp band was for Epac1; for Epac2 genotyping,
the upper 211 bp band represented Epac2+/+, whereas the
lower 90 bp band was for Epac2 (Figure 1A).
1.3
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO)
tMCAO was performed as previously described [11,22,23].
Briefly, after the mice (812 weeks old) were anesthetized
(2% halothane in 70% N2O/30% O2 for induction and 1%
halothane in 70% N2O/30% O2 for maintenance), a nylon
filament was inserted into the common carotid artery, directed to the right internal carotid artery, and finally reached
the bifurcation between the middle and anterior cerebral
arteries. This blocked the middle cerebral artery and its
branch, the ophthalmic artery, leading to an interruption in
the blood supply to the eye. Laser Doppler flowmetry
(Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) was used to measure the relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of middle cerebral artery
territory so as to ensure the successful occlusion and reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery. The filament was left
for 2 h and was pulled out afterwards for a 22-h reperfusion
after which the mice were sacrificed for sample collection.
The ischemia was introduced to right eye (ipsilateral side)
while the left eye served as a contralateral control side.
1.4

Tissue processing

The eyeball was enucleated 24 h after induction of ischemia.
The cornea and lens were removed; the eye cup was fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 2 h. After
dehydration with graded series of ethanol, the eye cup was
embedded in paraffin wax. Seven micron-thick sections
were cut for morphological analysis.
1.5 Morphometric analysis
The thickness of the retina layers 300 μm adjacent to the
optic nerve was measured in paraffin embedded retinal sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The microphotographs were taken under 20× objective of an
Olympus IX71 microscope system (Olympus, Japan) linked
with a digital camera (SPOT CCD Digital Camera, Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI, USA). The
retinal layers being assessed were as follows: (a) outer lim-

(b) inner nuclear layer (INL), (c) inner plexiform layer
(IPL), (d) outer plexiform layer (OPL), (e) outer nuclear
layer (ONL), and (f) IPL to ILM. The relative differences
between contralateral and ipsilateral sides in Epac-wildtype
and Epac-deficient mice were compared in a blind fashion.
Cells in the GCL with pyknotic nuclei were defined as
dead cells. The number of the dead cells in the GCL layer
was counted in only one of the four consecutive sections of
one slide to avoid double counting. The differences between
contralateral and ipsilateral sides in Epac-wildtype and
Epac-deficient mice were compared.
1.6 Immunocytochemistry
The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated with
graded series of ethanol. The sections were then immersed
in 0.3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase, after which
they were incubated with 1.5% normal goat serum for 1 h at
room temperature. This was followed by incubation with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies
used and their concentrations were as follows: rabbit anti-GFAP (1:2,000; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), rabbit
anti-AQP 4 (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and
rabbit anti-peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6; 1:2,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The sections were subsequently incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Vector Laboratories, Berlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min at
room temperature. The immunoreactive signals were amplified by incubation with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30
min and visualized by diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(Zymed Laboratory, San Francisco, CA, USA) reaction for
2 min. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cover-slipped, and mounted with
mounting medium (Permount, Fisher Scientific, Waltham,

MA, USA). Photos of the sections were taken under Olympus IX71 microscope system (Olympus) with 10× to 40×
objectives linked with a digital camera (SPOT CCD Digital
Camera, Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Semiquantitative
analysis was used to assess the immunoreactivity as previously described with modifications [24,25]. Briefly, all retinal sections for analysis were processed at the same time in
a single round of the immunocytochemistry (ICC) experiment. After the immunocytochemical procedures, microscopic slides were randomly coded and examined in a
blinded approach. Scores were given based on the intensity
and location of the staining along the whole retina, a score
of 1 was assigned for the weakest immunoreactivity, and a
score of 5 was assigned for the strongest immunoreactivity.
Retinal sections were then decoded, and the scores were
compared among the experimental groups.
1.7

Western blot analysis

Retinae were dissected from the enucleated eyeballs and
homogenized in ice-cold radio immunoprecipitation assay
buffer (RIPA, 50 mmol L1 Tris, 150 mmol L1 NaCl, 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% NP-40) with
freshly added protease inhibitor. The samples were kept on
ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13,200 r min1 for 30
min at 4°C. The supernatant was kept as total protein lysate
and quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane.
After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in tris-buffered saline
with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was then incubated with mouse anti-Epac1 (1:1,000),
mouse anti-Epac2 (1:1,000) antibody, a kind gift from Dr.
Johannes Bos (Utrecht University), or mouse anti-α-tubulin
(1:4,000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), at 4°C overnight.

ies were used to probe the primary antibodies in the following day, and the protein bands were visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK).

Statistical analysis

All the data were expressed as mean±SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way analysis of variations
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post-test (GraphPad
Prism software, San Diego, CA, USA). Difference with
P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

2 Results
2.1

Confirmation of Epac deficiency

Western blot analysis showed that Epac1 bands could be
seen in Epac1+/+, Epac2+/+ and Epac2 retinal samples, but
not in Epac1 retinal samples; Epac2 bands could be seen
in Epac1+/+, Epac1, and Epac2+/+ samples, but no bands
were seen in Epac2 samples. The absence of Epac1 protein in Epac1 mice retinae and the absence of Epac2 protein in Epac2 mice retinae demonstrated that the Epac
gene was successfully knocked out in the retinae of
Epac1 and Epac2 mice, respectively (Figure 1B).

Neuronal cell death after tMCAO

In Epac1+/+ and Epac1mice, contralateral retinae displayed normal morphology after tMCAO (Figure 2A and C),
whereas in ipsilateral retinae, lesions in GCL, IPL and INL
were obvious (Figure 2B and D). Increased number of pyknotic cells was observed in ipsilateral retinal GCL after
tMCAO (67.4%±1.6% in Epac1+/+ and 65.4%±4.7% in
Epac1), when compared with their contralateral side retinae (9.2%±2.5% in Epac1+/+ and 12.4%±1.8% in Epac1).
However, there was no significant difference between these
two genotypes (Figure 2E; effect of tMCAO: F1,14=309.57,
P<0.0001; effect of genotype: F1,14=0.03, P=0.86; effect of
interaction: F1,14=0.68, P=0.42).
Between Epac2+/+ and Epac2 groups, there was no significant differences in the contralateral retinae (Figure 2F
and H). As expected, tMCAO induced neuronal death in
ipsilateral retinae (57.1%± 2.9% in Epac2+/+ and 68.9%±
1.2% in Epac2), whereas no such cell death was observed
in contralateral retinae (4.1%± 0.1% in Epac2+/+ and 5.1%±
0.8% in Epac2). Moreover, in Epac2 group, the number
of pyknotic cells observed in ipsilateral retinal GCL was
significantly higher than that in Epac2+/+ group mice (Figure 2J; effect of tMCAO: F1,16=3248.42, P<0.0001; effect
of genotype: F1,16=44.8, P< 0.0001; effect of interaction:

Retinal swelling after tMCAO

In H&E-stained sections, the disorganized retina morphology with cell death in GCL and INL layers, and increased
IPL thickness of ipsilateral retinae after tMCAO indicated
swelling. After tMCAO, slight increase in retinal thickness
was observed in the ipsilateral retinae of both Epac1+/+ and
Epac1 mice, compared with their contralateral retinae.
However, no significant difference was found between these
two genotypes. In Epac2 mice, tMCAO induced an increased retinal thickness in the ipsilateral side, which was
mainly due to the increased thickness of IPL. Slightly increased thickness of inner retinal layer was observed in ipsilateral side of Epac2+/+. The inner retinal thickness increase in Epac2 group was significantly higher than that
of Epac2+/+ group (Table 1).
Immunocytochemical staining showed that, after tMCAO,
the expression of AQP4 was up-regulated in the ipsilateral
retinae in all genotypes (Figure 3B, D, G and I). The ICC
scoring indicated up-regulated AQP4 expression after
tMCAO in ipsilateral retinae in both Epac1+/+ and Epac1
mice, but the extent of AQP4 over-expression was similar in
both genotypes (Figure 3B, D and E; effect of tMCAO:
F1,16=105.13, P<0.0001; effect of genotype: F1,16=0.13,
P=0.73; effect of interaction: F1,16=0.13, P=0.73). However,
compared with contralateral retinae, Epac2 mice showed
significantly higher expression of AQP4 in ipsilateral retinae than that of Epac2+/+ retinae (Figure 3G, I and J; effect
of tMCAO: F1,12=69.36, P<0.0001; effect of genotype:
F1,12=8.64, P=0.01; effect of interaction: F1,12=11.76,
P=0.005).
2.4

Retinal glial cell activation after tMCAO

Glial cell reactivity was demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining for GFAP. Under normal condition, the
GFAP signal was restricted in the astrocytes and the end
feet of Müller cells, in GCL and OPL respectively (Figure
4A, C, F and H). After tMCAO, activation of Müller cells in
Table 1

525

June (2015) Vol.58 No.6

the ipsilateral retinae was observed with their processes
protruding from the ILM to the outer border of INL (Figure
4B, D, G and I). Ischemia-induced glial cell activation was
observed in both Epac1+/+ and Epac1 ipsilateral retinae,
but the extent of glial reactivation in these two genotypes
appeared similar (Figure 4E; effect of tMCAO: F1,16=138.89,
P<0.0001; effect of genotype: F1,16=0.22, P=0.64; effect of
interaction: F1,16=0.22, P=0.64). In ipsilateral retinae of
Epac2+/+, significant increase of GFAP expression was observed after tMCAO (Figure 4G). In ipsilateral retinae of
Epac2 mice, significant increase in GFAP expression was
also observed when compared with contralateral retinae.
However, the extent of increase of GFAP expression in ipsilateral retinae of Epac2-/- mice was higher than that of
Epac2+/+ ipsilateral retinae (Figure 4H and J; effect of
tMCAO: F1,12=101.77, P<0.0001; effect of genotype:
F1,12=5.77, P=0.03; effect of interaction: F1,12=5.77,
P=0.03).
2.5

Oxidative stress in the retina after tMCAO

Oxidative stress was determined by staining for Prx6. After
tMCAO, contralateral retinae appeared normal morphology
(Figure 5A, C, F and H). Compared with contralateral side,
more accumulation of Prx6 was observed in the ipsilateral
retinae (Figure 5B, D, G and I). The increased Prx6 was
observed in ipsilateral side of Epac1+/+ and Epac1 retinae,
but no significant difference was observed in ICC scoring
(Figure 5E; effect of tMCAO: F1,16=18.67, P=0.0005; effect
of genotype: F1,16=1.52, P=0.23; effect of interaction:
F1,16=0.38, P=0.55). ICC scoring showed significant upregulation of Prx6 in Epac2 ipsilateral retinae compared
with Epac2 contralateral retinae, but no significant Prx6
up-regulation was observed in Epac2+/+ ipsilateral retinae,
and more increase in Prx6 expression was observed in
Epac2 ipsilateral retinae (Figure 6G, I and J; effect of
tMCAO: F1,10=35.34, P=0.0001; effect of genotype:
F1,10=7.1, P=0.02; effect of interaction: F1,10=7.1, P=0.02).

3 Discussion
The Epac1 mice displayed neither developmental nor
reproductive abnormalities, but they showed an impaired
glucose tolerance and insulin secretion reduction after glucose challenge when compared with their Epac1+/+ littermates [20]. Epac2 mice also have such insulin secretion
dysfunction after glucose stimulation [26]. Under normal
condition, the retinae of these knockout mice appear normal.
In ischemic retinopathy induced by tMCAO, the retinal
neuronal cell loss in GCL is the major damage. Pyknosis is
an irreversible condensation of chromatin in the cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis, which is an indication of
cell death. In ischemic retinopathy studies, the pyknotic
cells have been used for neuronal cell death measurement
[11,22,23]. In all mice exposed to tMCAO, the percentage
of pyknotic cells in the ipsilateral GCL was significantly
higher than that in contralateral retinae. In Epac2 mice,
the ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in more neuronal
cell death, compared with control mice. However, there was
no obvious difference between Epac1+/+ and Epac1 ipsilateral side retinae after tMCAO. Our observations suggest
that loss of Epac2 may lead to more severe retinal GCL

neuronal cell loss after ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Water accumulation occurs after ischemic/reperfusion
injury due to the loss of membrane ionic pumps and cell
swelling [9]. AQP4 is the main water channel protein that
regulates the extracellular and intracellular water exchange
bidirectionally. The expression of AQP4 is increased during
ischemia, promoting retinal swelling. Glial cell swelling
occurs during reperfusion, down-regulating functional potassium channels and reduces transmembrane inward rectifying K+ (Kir) currents [27]. Therefore, ischemia/reperfusion process increases extracellular fluid volume and retinal
glial cells swelling, resulting in progressive thickening of
inner retina, which further contributes to degeneration of
photoreceptors and neuronal cells [28]. In Epac2 mice,
the ipsilateral retinae showed significant increase in the
thickness of inner retina after tMCAO, compared with those
of wildtype mice. In the present study, the increased thickness of inner retina was associated with up-regulation of
AQP4 after tMCAO. However, the inner retina thickening
was not that significant in Epac1 mice, when compared

Figure 4 GFAP immunoreactivity after tMCAO. Micrographs for Epac1+/+ contralateral (A), Epac1+/+ ipsilateral (B), Epac1contralateral (C), and
Epac1 ipsilateral retinae (D), Epac2+/+ contralateral (F), Epac2+/+ ipsilateral (G), Epac2 contralateral (H), and Epac2 ipsilateral (I) retinae were shown.
GFAP positive astrocytes (arrowheads) were restricted in GCL. Processes of activated Müller cells (arrows) could be seen in the ipsilateral retinae (B, D, G
and I). The n number in each group was 3 to 6. The micrographs were taken under 40× magnification. Scale bar, 50 μm. Semi-quantitative ICC scores for
Epac1 (E) and Epac2 (J) retinae were shown, *P<0.05, ***P<0.001, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test. Con., contralateral; Ipsi., ipsilateral; GCL, ganglion cell layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer.

immunoactivity of GFAP, a marker of astrocytes and important component of Müller cells, is a well-known sign for
glial activation. Under normal conditions, the astrocytes and
Müller cells reside in GCL and INL respectively, and the
GFAP staining signals are restricted in these two retinal
layers. After ischemia/reperfusion insult, the expression of
GFAP increased, shown as hypertrophy of astrocytes, and
Müller cell processes protruding from GCL to outer ONL.
In a 15 months old type 2 diabetes mice model, in which
retinal ischemia also occurred, the retinal GFAP expression
was higher than that in their non-diabetic littermates [10]. In
other studies using tMCAO to induce retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, GFAP expression is higher in the
ipsilateral side retinae compared to their contralateral control retinae [11,22,25]. Currently, it is clear that the more
intense GFAP staining is an indirect effect due to the more
severe ischemic retinopathy induced. Our observations on
intense GFAP staining in ipsilateral retinae were consistent
with previous data. More GFAP staining was observed in
Epac2 ipsilateral retinae when compared with Epac2+/+
ipsilateral retinae-the Epac2 retinae suffered more severe
retinopathy after tMCAO. In contrast, the difference in
GFAP expression in the ipsilateral retinae was not observed
in the ipsilateral retinae between Epac1+/+ and Epac1
mice.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury is often accompanied with
oxidative stress. When ischemia/reperfusion process occurs,
the free radicals and proteases are formed which further
disrupt brain-cell membranes, causing irreversible damage.
Therefore in this study, oxidative stress level was determined to reflect the extent of retinopathy. Prx6 is a member
of antioxidant enzyme that belongs to peroxiredoxin family.
It functions as a protective factor in ischemia/reperfusion
injury [3032]. Increased expression of Prx6 has been observed in the brain after tMCAO [33]. In our case, increased
Prx6 expression in the ipsilateral retinae was observed in
parallel with other observations. The extent of the increase
of Prx6 was higher in Epac2 mice, but not in other three
genotypes.
Epac1 and Epac2 are two isoforms of Epac proteins, with
differential expression patterns, which have been reported
since the discovery of Epac proteins [18]. Both Epac1 and
Epac2 are expressed in the retina [19]. It has been shown
that Epacs have a profound role in cognition, loss of Epacs
leads to impairment in memory retrieval in a fear conditioning paradigm [34], and it is also noted that in depressed
patients, the Epac2 expression but not Epac1 is altered in
the cortex [35]. Besides, Epac2 participates in synaptic
plasticity [17,36]. Such experimental evidence indicates that
Epac2 is more involved in CNS. Epac1 protein has been

known for its role in cell-cell contacts and calcium handling
in cardiomyocytes [12,37]. Epac1 has been shown to have
differential roles in different types of tissues: in cultured
cortical neurons, Epac1 promotes cell death after oxidative
stress, whereas it protects myocardial cells from oxidative
stress injury [38]. The Epac downstream effector, Rap1, has
been shown to regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell barrier
function [39]. The Epac proteins also participate in the neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, by increasing
PKB/Akt phosphorylation, in which Epac2 dominates the
function, whereas Epac1 functions in a smaller extent [15].
It appears that in CNS, Epac2 plays a beneficial role. Retina
is part of central nervous system with complex but
well-ordered neuronal circuit organization [40] and can be
viewed non-invasively. Therefore, it is reasonable that retinae lacking of Epac2 are more vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion insult. A recently published paper showed
that mice with conditional knockout of both Epac1 and
Epac2 (named Epac null) in the forebrain displayed defects
in generating artificial long-term potentiation (LTP),
whereas Epac1 knockout or Epac2 knockout did not show
such phenotype. Besides, only Epac null showed impaired
Rap1 activity, neither Epac1 nor Epac2 knockout showed
such activity loss in Rap1. These observations indicate that

Epac1 and Epac2 may compensate for each other when either one is not functioning under normal condition [41].
Under extreme conditions, such as ischemia/reperfusion
injury, this compensation mechanism might be disrupted.
As Epac2 protein is closely related to neuronal functions, in
retina, where locate different types of neurons, it is possible
that, under certain extreme circumstances, Epac1 may not
be able to compensate for the deletion of Epac2, thus
Epac2-deficiency leads to more severe damage.
In the present study, we made use of genetically manipulated mice with Epac1 or Epac2 gene deletion, combined
with tMCAO, to determine the role of Epac proteins in the
pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathy. Our data indicated
that Epac2 may play an important role in maintaining normal retinal function, since Epac2-deficient mice showed
more severe signs of ischemic retinopathy, such as neuronal
death, retinal swelling, glial reactivity, and oxidative stress
after retinal ischemia/reperfusion. However, the role of
Epac1 in pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathy was not as
significant as Epac2 based on our observations. Epac1-,
Epac2- and Epac1; Epac2-double mutant mice would serve
as essential tools to further understand the detailed mechanisms of Epac involvement in the pathogenesis of ischemic
retinopathy.
