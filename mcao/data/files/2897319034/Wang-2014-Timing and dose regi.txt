SUMMARY
Aims: Intravenous transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) had
been documented to improve functional outcome after ischemic stroke. However, the timing and appropriate cell number of transplantation to achieve better outcome after an episode of stroke remain further to be optimized. Methods: To determine the optimal
conditions, we transplanted different concentrations of BMSCs at different time points in a
rat model of ischemic stroke. Infarction volume and neurological behavioral tests were performed after ischemia. Results: We found that transplantation of BMSCs at 3 and 24 h, but
not 7 days after focal ischemia, significantly reduced the lesion volume and improved motor
deficits. We also found that transplanted cells at 1 9 106 to 107, but not at 1 9 104 to 105,
significantly improved functional outcome after stroke. In addition to inhibiting macrophages/microglia activation in the ischemic brain, BMSC transplantation profoundly
reduced infiltration of gamma delta T (cdT) cells, which are detrimental to the ischemic
brain, and significantly increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), along with altered Treg-associated cytokines in the ischemic brain. Conclusions: Our data suggest that timing and cell
dose of transplantation determine the therapeutic effects after focal ischemia by modulating
poststroke neuroinflammation.

Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of severe long-term disability in the
world. At present, there is no effective treatment for stroke.
Stem cell transplantation offers a new and exciting approach for
stroke treatment, as many studies have demonstrated favorable
results in animal models with various stem cell sources. Several
early Phase I and II clinical trials are now underway with
promising outcomes [1–3]. However, cell transplantation for
stroke therapy is still in its infancy, with many problems that
need to be resolved in order to achieve full potential as a therapy. Among the major hurdles for successful clinical application
is determining the optimal conditions of transplantation for
stroke treatment, which include the following aspects: (1)

thus benefitting many stroke patients. The appropriate time for
transplantation, however, is unknown. The literature has
reported a wide range of successful stroke-to-transplantation
intervals, including acute, subacute, and chronic phases. A comparison of these data to determine an optimum time window is
difficult as the studies used different models of stroke, methods
of cell delivery, cell types, and behavioral tests to assess effectiveness, thus highlighting a need for direct comparisons using
a standardized approach. (2) Optimal route and site of cell
delivery: two main routes of stem cell delivery have been used,
the first being intracerebral transplantation into the brain.
Given that stroke often results in a large area of infarction,
whether such a targeted method can offer efficient engraftment
remains largely unknown. An additional concern with this
approach is the invasive nature of stereotaxic transplantation.
An alternative route that can be considered is intravascular

injection. This approach does not necessarily depend on cellular
replacement, but rather on the activation of the self-repair
mechanisms in the brain. Although both approaches can
improve functional recovery after stroke [4,5], the optimal
route is still not apparent. (3) Optimal number of transplanted
cells: a wide range of cell numbers (1 9 104 to 2 9 107) has
been used for transplantation in animal models of stroke and in
the clinic setting, with improved functional recovery observed
after stroke. This raised the question of whether transplantation
of more cells would result in a better functional outcome.
A variety of cell types, including neural stem cells (NSCs) and
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), have been studied in the animal models of stroke. Of these, BMSCs may have the
largest therapeutic potential, as they can be harvested from the
patients themselves, avoiding possible ethical concerns or immunological problems [6,7]. Many studies have shown that
implanted BMSCs significantly improve motor deficits by differentiating into mature neuronal cells and/or by releasing a number of
growth factors that can protect damaged neural cell death [8,9].
Originally, stem cells appear to work by a “cell replacement”
mechanism. Currently, cell therapy is considered to provide trophic support to rescue the injured cells, fostering brain repair [3].
However, the mechanisms of which BMSCs-mediated neuroprotection after focal ischemia remains largely unexplored. Studies
have shown that molecular and cellular mediators of inflammatory responses play critical roles in the second injury progress after
ischemic stroke. As BMSCs have immune modulating properties
and can inhibit dendritic cell maturation, B and T cell proliferation and differentiation, attenuate natural killer cell activity, we
therefore asked whether BMSCs could improve functional
outcome by modulating poststroke neuroinflammation.
In this study, we have investigated the effect of optimal timing
and different amounts of BMSC transplantation on the functional
outcome in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. In addition, we
also asked whether optimal BMSC transplantation was able to
modulate poststroke inflammatory response in vivo in general and
modulate the number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells
(Tregs) and gamma delta T (cdT) cells in particular. In addition, we
confirmed the effects of BMSCs on inflammatory cells and associated cytokines by co-culture of human-derived BMSCs with
human peripheral immune cells in vitro.

Materials and methods
Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Sprague–Dawley rats (SD; body weight, 270~320 g) were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate. Permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) was performed as described
previously [10,11]. Briefly, the dura was incised and the left MCA
was exposed and occluded by electrocoagulation. Immediately
thereafter, both carotid arteries (CCAs) were occluded with
micro-clips and rats underwent simultaneous occlusion of the
MCA and both CCAs for 60 min. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0  0.5°C using a thermostat-controlled heating pad.
All animal procedures were approved by Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Wenzhou Medical University and
conducted according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and every
effort was made to minimize suffering and reduce the number of
animals used.

Infarction Volume Measurement
Rats were sacrificed 14 or 21 days after dMCAO. Rat brains were
embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-lm coronal sections, and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Stained sections were scanned
on a desktop scanner, and infarct area was measured using the
NIH Image software. Infarct volume is expressed as the percentage
of ipsilesional hemisphere compared with the contralesional
hemisphere [12].

Neurobehavioral Tests
Rats underwent neurobehavioral tests (n = 8–12 per group) to
evaluate functional outcome. The neurobehavioral tests, including the (1) beam walking test, (2) cylinder test, and (3) elevated
body swing test (EBST), were performed according to our previous
publications [13]. Animals were trained prior to the surgery, and
deficits were assessed, respectively, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days to determine the optimal dose of transplantation and 3, 6, 14, and 21 days
for determining the optimal window of transplantation. The
observer was blinded to the experimental condition.

Rat BMSC Preparation and Culture
Rat BMSCs were isolated and cultured as described previously
[14]. In brief, the bone marrow was obtained from the femurs and
tibias taken from male SD rats. Harvested cells were sieved
through a 70-lm nylon mesh and washed twice with medium, the
BMC suspension was diluted with PBS and transferred slowly onto
Percoll–Paque Plus, and the material was centrifuged for 25 min.
The mononuclear cell ring was collected and washed twice with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium-low glucose (DMEM-LG,
Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were then suspended in 5 mL DMEM-LG with 10% FCS (HyClone), 100 IU/mL
of penicillin, 100 IU/mL of streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and plated in 25-cm2 flasks at a density of 1 9 106 cells per
dish. After 3 days of culture with 5% CO2 at 37°C, nonadherent
hematopoietic cells were removed, and the medium was replaced.
When the adherent cells grew to 80% confluence, samples were
obtained and defined as passage zero (P0) cells. Rat BMSCs were
immunophenotypically characterized by flow cytometry using the
following monoclonal antibodies (all from eBioscience; 1:100 dilution): CD90-FITC, CD29-PE, CD45-APC. The cells were then
washed and loaded onto the flow cytometer (FACS calibur, BD,
San Jose, CA, USA), and the data were analyzed by the Flowjo
software. Each fluorescence analysis included appropriate PE-,
FITC-, APC-, and Percp 5.5-conjugated negative isotype control.

Cell Transplantation
Rat BMSCs were harvested at passage 5 and centrifuged (112 g).
The pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 mL sterilized PBS and injected
into the vein of the rat tail after dMCAO. To determine the optimal cell number for transplantation, BMSCs at 1 9 104, 1 9 105,

1 9 106, 2 9 106, and 1 9 107 were transplanted 24 h after focal
ischemia. PBS was used as the vehicle. To determine the optimal
window for transplantation, 2 9 106 and 1 9 107 BMSCs or PBS
were transplanted 3 h, 24 h, and 7 days after MCAO. Data were
collected from animals before surgery and 3, 6, 14, and 21 days
after dMCAO (n = 8–14).

Human BMSC and Immune Cell Co-cultures
Research was conducted in compliance with the policies and
principles contained in the Federal Policy for the Protection of
Human Subjects and approved by the Institutional Research
Review Board at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical
University. Human BMSCs (hBMSCs) (n = 8) were obtained from
healthy volunteer donors at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College after informed consent. The mean age of the
donors was 36  5 years (ranging from 31 to 53 years). The bone
marrow aspirate (10 mL) was diluted in PBS and gently layered
onto a Percoll cushion for density gradient centrifugation. The low
density of hBMSCs-enriched mononuclear cells were collected
and re-suspended in a-MEM containing 10% FBS and plated at a
concentration of 1 9 106 cells/mL into a 25 cm2 tissue culture
flask. The cultures were then incubated at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. After 72 h, nonadherent
cells in the supernatant were removed, and the medium was completely replaced with fresh medium. hBMSCs (passage 3–5) were
immunophenotypically characterized by flow cytometry using the
following monoclonal antibodies (all from BD Biosciences; 1:20
dilution): CD90-FITC, CD44-PE, CD73-APC, CD105-Percp 5.5,
CD34-PE, CD11b-PE, CD19-PE, CD45-PE, and HLA-DR-PE.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from
peripheral blood (n = 5) by density gradient centrifugation under
sterile conditions and washed twice in RPMI-1640, then suspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS) at a density of 2 9 106 cells/mL for use. Human
BMSCs obtained after 3–4 passages were seeded into six-well
plates at a density of 10 9 104 cells/well suspended in 2 mL of
hBMSCs’ complete medium overnight. The unstimulated PBMCs
(1 9 106) were then co-cultured with the plated hBMSCs
(1 9 105) for 1 or 4 days in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells without
hBMSCs were designated the control group. The experiments
were repeated at least three times for each time point.

Isolation of Immune Cells from Brains
Isolation of brain immune cells was performed following the wellestablished method with a few modifications [15]. Briefly, rat
forebrain hemispheres (n = 6 per group) were removed after thorough perfusion with 200 mL of ice-cold PBS. Hemispheres were
minced into small pieces in ice-cold RPMI-1640 medium. Brain
tissue was then digested with 1 mg/mL collagenase type IV for
45 min at 37°C. Digested tissue was filtered through 70-lm cell
strainers to prepare single cell suspension in 30% Percoll. Cells
were then subjected to Percoll gradient isolation by centrifugation
at 500 g for 20 min. The cellular interlayer between 37% Percoll
and 70% Percoll was collected and washed twice with cold PBS
for flow cytometric staining.

Flow Cytometry Analysis
For cell surface marker staining, the following fluorochrome-conjugated anti-rat antibodies were used (all from eBioscience unless
otherwise indicated): PE anti-TCRcd (V659; 1:200), APC anti-CD3
(G4.18; 1:100), FITC anti-CD4 (OX35; 1:200), APC anti-CD25
(OX-39; 1:100), PE anti-Foxp3 (PEFJK-16s, 1:100), FITC antiCD45 (BD Pharmingen; 1:100), APC anti-CD11b (BD Pharmingen; 1:20). The following fluorochrome-conjugated anti-human
antibodies were used (all from BD Biosciences): PE anti-TCRcd
(B1; 1:20), FITC anti-CD3 (UCHT1; 1:5), FITC anti-CD4 (RPAT4; 1:5), APC anti-CD25 (M-A251; 1:5), PE anti-CD8 (RPA-T8;
1:5). Cells were incubated with antibodies for 20 min and
washed once with PBS before analysis on a BD FACS Calibur
flow cytometer. For Treg detection, AlexaFluor-488 anti-mouse/
rat/human Foxp3 (150D; 1:100 for rat and 1:5 for human) was
used. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Fix/Perm Buffer
(Biolegend) as per manufacturer’s instructions. For cell sorting,
stained cells were sorted on a FACS machine, and the results
were analyzed using FlowJo 7.6.1 software (Tree Star Inc.,
Ashland, VA, USA).

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Rat ipsilateral or contralateral hemispheres were homogenized
in PBS containing 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C
and the supernatant was collected. Levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-1b,
IL-2, TNF-a, TGF-b, and IFN-c were measured using corresponding ELISA kits (R&D). Extracts from all brain tissue were
assayed in duplicates. The optical density was determined by a
microplate reader set to 450 nm with wavelength being
540 nm.

Cytometric Bead Array (CBA)
Levels of hIL-2, hIL-4, hIL-6, hIL-10, hIFN-c, hTNF-a, and
hIL-17 in cell culture supernatant were measured with CBA
human Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit (BD, Biosciences), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mixed capture beads
(containing hIL-2, hIL-4, hIL-6, hIL-10, hIFN-c, hTNF-a, and
hIL-17) were added into each sample; Th1/Th2/Th17 PE detection Reagent was then added into all tests and incubated for
3 h at room temperature. Similarly, hTGF-b level was measured
using the BD CBA Human Soluble Protein Master Buffer Kit
(BD, Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The beads were washed, resuspended, and then loaded on the
FACS Calibur. Data were analyzed using the FCAP Array
Software (BD, Bioscience).

Statistical Analysis
SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
data analysis. The results are presented as mean  SEM. One-way
ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 post hoc test was used for
multiple comparisons. While comparing two groups, a two-tailed
Student’s t-test was used to determine statistical significance.
Results were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Optimization of Transplantation Conditions
Reduced Lesion Size and Improved Motor
Deficits
Rat- and human-derived BMCs were cultured, and they displayed
typical spindlelike or starlike morphology (data not shown). Flow
cytometry analysis indicated that rat-derived BMCs were uniformly positive for CD90 and CD29, and negative for CD45
(Figure S1A and B), while human-derived BMCs were positive for
CD90, CD44, CD73, and CD105 (Figure S1C and D), confirming
that these cells are BMSCs. To determine the optimal time
window of transplantation, 2 9 106 BMSCs were intravenously
injected at 3 h, 24 h, and 7 days after focal ischemia (dMCAO).
Lesion volume was determined 21 days after ischemia
(Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, the lesion volume was
significantly decreased when BMSCs were administered at 3 and

(A)

24 hr after ischemia (P < 0.01), compared with MCAO + vehicletreated group. No significant difference was found between
BSMC- and vehicle-treated groups when cells were transplanted
at 7 days after stroke (P > 0.05). Consistent with histological
results, neurobehavioral tests including EBST and cylinder test,
the results indicated that motor deficits were significantly
improved if BMSCs was administrated at 3 and 24 h, but not at
7 days, after ischemia (Figure 1C and D).
Next, we determined the appreciated number of transplanted
cells after focal ischemia. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells at
1 9 104, 1 9 105, 1 9 106, 2 9 106, 1 9 107 were intravenously
injected 24 h after focal ischemia, and infarct volume was determined 14 days after dMCAO. We found that infarct volume was
significantly reduced after transplantation of 1 9 106, 2 9 106, and
1 9 107 BMSCs, but not when 1 9 104 and 1 9 105 BMSCs were
administrated. Interestingly, no significant difference was found
between groups treated with BMSCs at 1 9 106, 2 9 106, 1 9 107

(Figure 2A). Consistent with histological results, there was a significant difference in the motor performance as observed in the
beam walking test, cylinder test, and EBST between vehicle- and
2 9 106 and 1 9 107 BMSC-treated groups (Figure 2C and D).

BMSC Transplantation Ameliorated Poststroke
Inflammation
To explore the mechanisms by which BMSC administration
reduced lesion size, we first determined the infiltrating lymphocytes in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as poststroke inflammation
contributes to initiation and progression of brain damage. We
found that BMSC transplantation significantly reduced lymphocyte numbers after stroke, providing evidence that BMSC administration indeed inhibited lymphocyte infiltration or promoted
lymphocyte death (Figure 3A). Among these lymphocytes, total
CD3+ T cells were profoundly reduced in comparison with the
control group (Figure 3B), and so is the case for cdT cells
(Figure 3C). CD3+ T cells are major T cells involved in inflammation, and cdT cells are a major source of IL-17 production in the
brain that induces neuronal damage.
We then determined whether other pro-inflammatory or antiinflammatory immune cells were influenced by BMSC transplantation. In current literature, Tregs are known to be the major cell
type that inhibits extra immune reactions in the periphery. We
found that BMSC treatment robustly increased the proportion of
Tregs in the brain after stroke (Figure 4A), suggesting that neuroinflammation could be more efficiently alleviated by the antiinflammatory activities of Tregs. As M1 macrophages and
microglia are involved in neuroinflammation, we looked at the
changes in their levels and found a significant reduction in
macrophages after BMSC treatment (Figure 4B and C).
The BMSC transplantation-induced alterations of immune cells
in postischemic stroke suggest that the inflammation-associated

deficits after distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (dMCAO). Rats underwent dMCAO
and BMSCs at 1 9 104, 1 9 105, 1 9 106,
2 9 106, 1 9 107 were transplanted at 24 h
after focal ischemia. The infarct volume was
determined by H&E staining at 14 days after
ischemia (A). In separate sets of experiments,
BMSCs at 2 9 106 and 1 9 107 were
transplanted after focal ischemia, and
behavioral tests, including beam walking test
(B), cylinder test (C), and EBST (D), were
performed at 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after
ischemia. *P < 0.05, compared with
vehicle-treated group.

cytokine production could be changed in ischemic hemispheres.
To confirm this hypothesis, we tested four major ischemic lesion
formations or progression-related cytokines in the ischemic
regions after BMSC transplantation and found that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-c, and TNF-a in the BMSC-implanted
group were moderately decreased, compared with the control
group, though at different days postischemia. Moreover, antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was apparently elevated from day 3
to day 7 postischemia after transplantation (Figure 5). It was
reported previously that increased IL-10 production was able to
attenuate secondary CNS injury in postischemic stroke-induced
inflammation [16]. Taken together, these data provide a mechanistic clue to the protective efficacy of BMSCs in ischemic brains.
To further elucidate the mechanisms by which BMSC administration offers neuroprotection, we then investigated the presence
of direct effects on lymphocyte differentiation and activation from
BMSCs by co-culturing PBMCs and BMSCs. The co-culture of
PBMCs and BMSCs reduced the proportion of total CD3+ T cells or
their CD8+ subset (Figure 6A–D). In addition, at day 4 postculture,
BMSCs significantly decreased the proportion of cdT cells and
increased the proportion of CD4+ Tregs (Figure 6E and F), which
is consistent with in vivo results (Figure 3C and 4A).
To detect whether co-culture of BMSCs and PBMCs can induce
similar cytokine profiles in vitro to the extent as in the ipsilateral
hemisphere, we measured levels of some inflammation-associated
cytokines in the culture supernatants. Interestingly, in this coculture, IL-10 and IL-6 levels were significantly up-regulated,
and there were no significant changes in the levels of IL-4, IFN-c,
TNF-a, and IL-17 (Figure S2).

Discussion
In this study, we found that transplantation of BMSCs at different
time windows or at different doses significantly affected the lesion

volume and motor function recovery after focal ischemia, implying that optimal time window and appreciated cell number of
transplantation are critical for stroke therapy in a clinical setting.
In addition, we also studied the mechanisms and found that
BMSCs were able to modulate poststroke inflammatory responses
by selectively reducing deleterious and enhancing protective
actions of inflammatory cells and mediators. The in vitro study
confirmed that BMSCs directly interacted with PBMCs (source of
a large number of T lymphocytes) and affected the proportion of
Tregs and cdT cells as well as productions of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines.
Systemic thrombolysis with intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) is the only treatment proven to improve the
clinical outcome of stroke patients. Despite it being successful,
only a small proportion (1–2%) of stroke patients actually
benefit from tPA due to an increased risk of hemorrhage
beyond 4.5 h poststroke [17]. A great promise of stem cell

therapy is that it will extend the therapeutic time window,
thus benefiting a larger number of patients [18]. Bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for stroke treatment has
been studied by many groups. However, the best and most
appropriate time window to transplant BMSCs in order to have
a beneficial effect after an episode of stroke is unknown. A
recent study showed that transplanting cells shortly after stroke
(48 h) achieved better cell survival as compared to a later time
point (6 weeks) [19]. We found that when BMSCs were transplanted 3 and 24 h after ischemic stroke, better histological
and behavioral outcomes were achieved as compared to a later
time point (7 days). During the acute stage of ischemic stroke,
release of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, free radicals as well as
proinflammatory mediators may threaten transplanted cells in
the acute setting, and inflammation leading to microglial
activation may inhibit the growth of implanted cells [20–22].
However, growth factors released from the intrinsic milieu and

the host environment during the early phase can improve
transplanted cell survival, differentiation, and/or integration.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation at the
chronic phase may contend with the disadvantage of scar tissue formation, which may adversely affect implanted cells. Our
data indicate that BMSCs can be transplanted up to 24 h after
the onset of ischemic stroke. Hence, the time window for therapeutic intervention has extended compared with intravenous
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which has a 4.5-h window.
In addition to the therapeutic time window, optimal number of
transplanted cells for ischemic stroke is also unclear. According to
STEPS guideline, a weight-based translation should be followed
based on the optimal dose in animal studies [23]. Previous studies
have transplanted different cell numbers into the striatum or cortex of animals subjected to stroke and the results varied between
studies, thus are difficult to be compared to each other. Our data
indicate that dose regimen is an important factor in optimizing cell
therapy, as low numbers of transplanted cells did not improve the
functional outcome after ischemic stroke, and on the other hand,

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

larger numbers of transplanted cells were deemed unnecessary.
A recent study showed that increasing the number of implanted
NSCs beyond a certain number did not cause a greater number of
surviving cells. Consistently, our results showed that no significant difference was found between groups implanted with
1 9 106 to 1 9 107. Exceeding the optimal threshold of cells being
transplanted may saturate the damaged striatum, result in insufficient amounts of nutrients reaching the grafted cells, and thereby
progressively decrease survival rate [19]. In addition, intravascular delivery may raise concerns of cells sticking together and creating microemboli. Therefore, this is not a case of “the more the
merrier” as transplanting more cells does not necessarily lead to a
greater number of cells that survive and/or improve functional
outcome in postischemic stroke treatment.
Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of transplanted stem cells after ischemic
stroke is important for clinical translation. The two most discussed repair mechanisms of stem cells-mediated functional
improvement are by far the more intriguing and hold more

Figure 5 Cytokine profile in the ischemic brain
after bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell
(BMSC) transplantation. Rats were treated with
vehicle or BMSCs (2 9 106) at 3 hr after focal
ischemia, and the ischemic hemispheres were
isolated at 1, 3, and 7 days after dMCAO. IL-6

determined by ELISA (n = 5 per time point).

potential than others: (1) cellular replacement and (2) release
of growth factors. The mechanisms underlying BMSC-mediated
neuroprotection remain unknown. Although BMSCs are able to
differentiate into neuronal cells, studies have shown that neuronal differentiation rates are low and thus unlikely to significantly enhance outcome after stroke [24]. Notably, in addition
to release of growth factors to increase neurogenesis and angiogenesis [25], BMSCs may protect from ischemic injury via modulation of poststroke inflammatory response as BMSCs can
modulate adaptive and innate immune responses in animal
models of immune disorders [26] as well as in ischemic animal
models [27,28]. For example, BMSCs could secrete TGF-b to
suppress immune propagation in the ischemic rat brain [28].
Another study showed that BMSCs decrease markers of microglial activation and astrogliosis following transplantation after
ischemia in vitro and in vivo [27].
Inflammatory responses postischemia are characterized by a
rapid activation of brain resident immune cells (mainly microglial
cells), followed by the infiltration of circulating inflammatory cells
including granulocytes, T cells, and monocytes/macrophages, in
the ischemic brain region [29]. Our data show that BMSC transplantation significantly reduced T cell infiltration into the ischemic brain, suggesting that BMSCs alleviate postischemic
inflammation via immunomodulation. In addition, macrophages/
microglia are activated to release neurotoxic mediators after ischemia. Many of these mediators can in turn influence microglia
morphology and activate it to release inflammatory factors that
act in a paracrine and autocrine fashion [30]. In the present study,
BMSCs are shown to inhibit the activated microglia/macrophages
in the ischemic brain.
T cell subsets have recently been implicated as modulators of
secondary infarct progression and repair processes [31]. Among
these, Tregs are well characterized, with their ability to suppress immune and autoimmune reactions, and their important
roles have been emphasized by the severe pathological conditions associated with Treg deficiency [32–36]. A recent study

324

CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics 20 (2014) 317–326

has demonstrated that Tregs inhibit excessive production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulate invasion and/or activation of lymphocytes and microglia in the ischemic brain to
prevent secondary infarct growth [37]. Tregs depletion significantly amplified secondary brain damage and deteriorated functional deficits. Tregs also antagonized ischemia-induced TNF-a
and IFN-c production, which induced delayed inflammatory
brain damage [37]. In contrast, cdT cells have pivotal roles in
the evolution of brain infarction and accompanying neurological deficits after stroke [15]. Activated cdT cells infiltrated the
brain after ischemia, which, in turn, produced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 within hours. cdT cell depletion or
pharmacological inhibition of the IL-23 or IL-17 production
ameliorated ischemic injury [15]. Our PBMC transplantation
in vivo data show that Tregs are significantly increased and cdT
cells are reduced in the ischemic hemisphere after BMSC transplantation. Similar data were found when BMSCs were incubated with human PBMNC population. The findings indicate
that BMSCs can modulate T cell subpopulations, consistent
with previous findings [38,39]. However, the mechanisms
underlying regulation of Tregs by BMSCs remain unclear. Cell
contact, soluble mediators (prostaglandin E2, IL-10, and TGFb), and indirect induction via manipulation of other antigenpresenting cells all appear to have vital roles in the interactions
between BMSCs and Tregs [40]. In addition, BMSCs can reprogramme conventional T cells into Tregs [38]. TGF-b and indoleamine 2,3-deoxygenase may play a role in BMSCs-mediated
cdT cell production [39].
Inflammatory mediators released from these pro-inflammatory cells play a critical role in postischemic brain injury [41].
The most studied cytokines related to inflammation in acute
ischemic stroke are TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-20, IL-10, and TGF-b.
While IL-1b and TNF-a appear to exacerbate cerebral injury,
TGF-b and IL-10 are touted to be neuroprotective [16,42,43].
We found that antiinflammatory IL-10 was increased and proinflammatory TNF-a and IL-6 were reduced in the ischemic

regions after BMSC transplantation, suggesting that BMSCs
modulate cytokine secretion. To our surprise, our in vitro data
showed that although IL-10 levels were significantly up-regulated after co-culture, IL-6 levels also increased. This observation may very well reflect the complex interaction between
BMSCs and PBMCs. Of note, IL-2 levels were increased after
co-culture, suggesting that this could be a cause of the
increased number of Tregs as the production of IL-2 supports
Treg homeostasis and maintenance.
In conclusion, our findings show that optimal timing and most
appropriate number of transplanted cells are critical for the treatment of ischemic stroke. BMSCs are able to prevent secondary
injury and improve functional outcome via selectively reducing
deleterious and enhancing protective actions of inflammatory
cells.
