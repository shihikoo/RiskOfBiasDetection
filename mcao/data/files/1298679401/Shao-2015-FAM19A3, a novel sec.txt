In this study, we have identiﬁed FAM19A3 as a gene that is signiﬁcantly upregulated in the microglia
in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model. FAM19A3 expression and secretion
were promoted by M2 stimuli, and this indicated that FAM19A3 might be an M2-type gene. Indeed,
recombinant FAM19A3 promoted M2 polarization and inhibited M1 polarization of microglia
in vitro. Similarly, recombinant FAM19A3 promoted M2 polarization of microglia and macrophages
in vivo, and attenuated cerebral ischemia in the MCAO mouse model. Thus, the newly-identiﬁed
secreted protein FAM19A3 modulates the microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics and
ameliorates cerebral ischemia.

1. Introduction
Brain tissue damage after cerebral ischemia is exacerbated by a
complex pattern of pathophysiologic mechanisms including
excitotoxicity, peri-infarct depolarizations, inﬂammation, and
apoptosis [1–3]. Besides inﬂammatory cells, microglia/macrophages are the primary mediators of the immune defense system
against brain injuries and are integral to subsequent inﬂammatory
responses. Resident microglia are rapidly mobilized to the site of
injury and initiate the release of effector molecules and recruitment of other immune reactive cells [4,5].
Increasing evidences now support that microglia/macrophages
are highly plastic cells that can assume diverse phenotypes and
engage different functional programs in response to speciﬁc microenvironmental signals such as stroke [6,7]. In particular, in vitro
stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-c (IFNc) promotes the differentiation of ‘‘classically activated’’ M1 microglia/
macrophages that typically release catastrophic pro-inﬂammatory
mediators [8]. In contrast, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 induce an
‘‘alternatively activated’’ M2 phenotype that possesses neuroprotective properties [6,9,10]. Recently, the concept of microglial M1
and M2 phenotypes also has entered the ﬁeld of stroke research

[11] and the microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics has
been to some extent elucidated in the expansion after focal cerebral ischemia [12]. Brieﬂy, M2 microglia/macrophages are reported
to promote the survival of cortical neurons under both normal and
ischemic/hypoxic conditions [12,13]. The early recruitment of M2
microglia/macrophages might thus represent an endogenous effort
to clean ischemic tissue and restrict brain damage. Nevertheless,
M2 phagocyte response was transient and phased out within
7 days after injury. Meanwhile, M1 microglia/macrophages, which
are well characterized by reduced phagocytosis and increased
secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines, begin to dominate the
injured area. It is thus conceivable that the M2-to-M1 shift during
chronic inﬂammation after cerebral ischemia expands neuronal
injury and leads to insufﬁcient neuronal recovery. However, many
questions are still unanswered about M1 and M2 polarization and
the phenotypic shift during stroke progression especially the signals that induce the microglia/macrophage phenotype shift and
maintain their phenotype. Elucidating the unknown mechanism
of microglia/macrophage phenotype shift regulation may lead to
a better way in stroke therapy.
FAM19A3, also known as TAFA3, has recently been named and
described as a member of a cluster of genes named the TAFA family
(TAFA1-5), and was found to be predominantly expressed in the
central nervous system [14]. Based on the transfected COS7 cells
expression system, it is demonstrated that the FAM19A3 encoding

polypeptide is secreted into the culture medium. Sequence homology analysis shows that the FAM19A3 is distantly related to macrophage inﬂammatory protein 1a, a member of the chemokine CC
family and is suggested to function as a brain-speciﬁc chemokine
or neurokine [14].
Here, we demonstrated that FAM19A3 was induced by transient
focal cerebral ischemia using a well-established mice middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and the dynamics of
FAM19A3 mRNA expression was consistent with M2 polarization
makers. That FAM19A3 expression and secretion were promoted
by M2 stimuli further conﬁrmed FAM19A3 might be a M2-type
candidate gene in the reaction to the cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, recombinant FAM19A3 was capable of microglia M2 polarization promotion and microglia M1 polarization inhibition.
Notably, administration of recombinant FAM19A3 attenuated cerebral ischemia in the mice MCAO model and maintained the M2
microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics in vivo. Taken
together, our in vivo and in vitro ﬁndings support the notion that
FAM19A3, a novel secreted protein, modulates the microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics and ameliorates cerebral ischemia.

PEI (polyscience). 16 h later, 293T cells transfected by the plasmid
were washed with PBS and cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression
Medium. Three or 4 days after transfection, supernatant was collected and centrifuged, and the clariﬁed supernatant was then
adjusted to 20 mM PB (pH 8.0). The SP Sepharose column was
pre-equilibrated with 20 mM PB (pH 8.0), and the supernatant
was applied to the column. The column was washed with 10-bed
volumes of 20 mM PB (pH 8.0), and then bound proteins were
eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in 20 mM PB (pH
8.0). Each fraction was analyzed by SDS–PAGE followed by Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining, and the fractions containing
the recombinant FAM19A3 protein were pooled and concentrated
by 3 kD Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentration containing the recombinant FAM19A3 protein was applied
onto a Superdex 75 gel ﬁltration column (GE) equilibrated with
PBS (pH 7.4). Each fraction was analyzed by SDS–PAGE followed
by Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining, and the fractions with
99% purity recombinant FAM19A3 protein were pooled and concentrated to an appropriate concentration by 3 kD Amicon Ultra15. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of
Bradford using BSA as a standard.

2. Materials and methods

2.4. Preparation the polyclonal antibody against FAM19A3

2.1. Reagents

Anti-FAM19A3 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizations of New Zealand rabbits with recombinant eukaryotic protein of FAM19A3. Recombinant FAM19A3 protein was coupled
with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B to purify the antibody by immunoafﬁnity chromatography. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) was performed to detect the titers of the antiserums. After
puriﬁcation, the antibody was identiﬁed by Western blotting.

Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine
serum (FBS) were purchased from HyClone Lab, Inc. FreeStyle™
293 expression medium was purchased from GIBCO. TMB substrate solution and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from
Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The human and mouse multiple tissue cDNA panels were purchased from Clontech. Monoclonal
mouse anti-FAM19A3 antibody (clone#460904) was from R&D
Systems. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, protein G, Ni-NTA high performance, SP Sepharose fast ﬂow were purchased from GE Corporation. Biotin Labeling Kit was from Elabscience (Wuhan, China).

2.2. Cell culture
Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (ATCC) were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS),
penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 lg/mL). Cultures
were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5%
CO2 and 95% air.
Primary cultures of microglial cells were established from
brains of newborn C57BL/6 mice (1–3 days) as described previously. After removal of the meninges, cells were mechanically dissociated and suspended in DMEM with Glutamax I supplemented
with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 lg/mL).
Cells obtained from two mice brains were plated at T75 culture
ﬂask and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%
air. Culture medium was changed twice a week. After a conﬂuent
monolayer of glial cells was obtained (12–14 days after initial
seeding), microglia were shaken off, collected and seeded.
For M1 induction, lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/mL) and IFNc
(20 ng/mL) were added to the microglial cultures for indicated
time. For M2 induction, IL-4 (20 ng/mL) was added to the culture
for indicated time.
2.3. Cloning, construction and puriﬁcation of recombinant FAM19A3
protein
PCR-generated fragment containing the entire ORF of human
FAM19A3 was inserted in the pCDNA3.1B vector from Invitrogen.
DNA was used in transient transfections of 10-cm plates using

2.5. ELISA detection of FAM19A3
ELISA plates were coated with 1 lg/mL rabbit anti FAM19A3
polyclonal antibody as the capture antibody in coating buffer.
Sealed the plate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing,
ELISA plates were blocked with 5% BSA in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4 (PBST). Incubated at room
temperature for 1 h. 5% BSA in PBST was used to dilute standards.
Add 100 ll/well of top standard concentration to the appropriate
wells, perform 2-fold serial dilutions of the top standards to make
the standard curve for a total of 8 points and add 100 lL/well of
samples to the appropriate wells. Sealed the plate and incubated
overnight at 4 °C for maximal sensitivity, washed again, and followed by incubation with 100 lL/well of 1 lg/mL biotin labeled
monoclonal mouse anti-FAM19A3 antibody. Incubated at room
temperature for 1 h, washed again, and followed by incubation
with avidin-HRP for 30 min. The plate was washed, TMB substrate
solution was added, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 1
N H2SO4. Optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm using an
automated ELISA reader.
2.6. Real-time PCR
Sham and ischemic brains of MCAO treated mice were dissected
at different time points. Total RNA of the brains was extracted
using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
1 lg of total RNA was converted to cDNA by SuperScript™ III
First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). PCR was performed on ABI Prism 7000 using corresponding
primers (Supplementary Table S1) and SYBR gene PCR Master Mix
(Invitrogen). Template cDNA was denatured at 95 °C for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The
quantiﬁcation data were analyzed with ABI Prism 7000 SDS software. The cycle time values were normalized to GAPDH of the

reported as fold changes versus the indicated control.

analyzed for each brain. Data are expressed as mean numbers of
cells per square millimeter.

2.7. Murine model of transient focal ischemia

2.10. Statistical analysis

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Vital River. All mice were
housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free facility at our campus. All protocols in this study were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Studies at Jilin University and Capital Medical University.
Male 12-week-old C57/BL6 mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane for induction and maintained with 1.5% isoﬂurane, 70%
N2O, and 30% O2 via a face mask.
Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by intraluminal occlusion
of the left middle cerebral artery for 60 min. During surgery and
MCAO, the rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 °C ± 0.5 °C
via a temperature regulated heating pad. Regional cerebral blood
ﬂow was monitored in all stroke animals using Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry. Animals that did not show a regional cerebral blood ﬂow
reduction to <30% of preischemia baseline levels during MCAO
were excluded from further experimentation, as were animals that
died during postischemic reperfusion.
Sham-operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and
surgical procedures except MCAO. Animals were randomly allocated to sham and MCAO groups with different reperfusion duration through the use of a lottery-drawing box. The control group
treated with the vehicle; dose groups treated with recombinant
FAM19A3 0.1, 1 or 10 lg/day by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.
IL-4 (10 lg/day) was used as the positive control.
The mice were killed by decapitation, and their brains were
divided into seven 2-mm sections using a mouse brain matrix,
brain slices were then stained with 2% 2.3.5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath as previously
described [15]. Areas that were not stained red with TTC were
identiﬁed as the infarct area. After staining, the brain slices were
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and each section was
photographed with a scale bar. The areas of infarction were delineated on the basis of the relative lack of staining in the ischemic
region and measured by using ImageJ software.

All data were statistically analyzed by use of Graph Pad Prism
5.0 software. The data were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test or Newman–Keuls test, unless otherwise
indicated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

2.8. Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence were performed on 30-lm free-ﬂoating sections. For immunohistochemistry, brain slices were immunostained with rabbit anti FAM19A3
polyclonal antibody. Positive staining was detected using Dakocytomation Envision™ System HRP (DakoCytomation), and then
counter-stained with hematoxylin. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control.
For immunoﬂuorescence, primary antibodies include goat antiCD206 (R&D Systems), rat anti-CD16/32 (BD), and rabbit anti-Iba1
(Wako). All images were processed with Image J for counting of
automatically recognized cells. The means were calculated from
3 randomly selected microscopic ﬁelds in the peri-infarct cortex
of each section, respectively, and 3 consecutive sections were analyzed for each brain. Data are expressed as mean numbers of cells
per square millimeter.
2.9. TUNEL staining
Brain slices were also immunostained with anti neuronal nuclei
(NeuN; Millipore) and then subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining
with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Inc, Mannheim,
Germany). The TUNEL-positive neurons were counted in the
peri-infarct cortex of each section, and 3 consecutive sections were

3. Results
3.1. Molecular cloning, puriﬁcation and characterization of human
FAM19A3
Human FAM19A3, family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine
(C-C motif)-like), member A3, (GeneID: 284467; GenBank accession
numbers: NM_182759.2), also known as TAFA3, was ﬁrst described
by bioinformatics in human and mice and belongs to a family of
highly homologous genes called TAFA [14]. According to the signal
peptide prediction program SignalP 4.1 software (http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk) [16], proteins encoding by FAM19A3 in man and mouse
contained a signal peptide cleavage site. An alignment of FAM19A3
amino acid sequences from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus
showed the FAM19A3 mature polypeptides were identical
between man and mouse except for several substitution (nearly
93%) (Supplementary Fig. S1A) which indicates that FAM19A3
may have important biological function across species.
To verify FAM19A3 a soluble secretory protein, we ﬁrst constructed the pCDNA3.1B- FAM19A3-myc-his, then transfected into
the HEK 293T cells to investigate whether FAM19A3 can be secreted
to the supernatant. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B, the soluble
secretory form of FAM19A3 can be detected by mouse anti-myc
antibody at about 14kD position. To obtain the high grade recombinant FAM19A3 protein to do the research, we have constructed
pCDNA3.1B-FAM19A3 to generate the recombinant FAM19A3 protein without any tags in the puriﬁcation process. Supplementary
Fig. S1C shows that FAM19A3 have been successfully puriﬁed.
The molecular mass was about 12kD and the purity of FAM19A3
was above 98%. Endotoxin level of the recombinant FAM19A3 protein was detected below 0.01 EU per 1 lg by the LAL method.
For the purpose of detecting the concentration of FAM19A3 in
the culture medium, we have developed the sandwich ELISA
method. The lower limit of quantiﬁcation of the ELISA was 50
pg/mL. FAM19A4 is also a member of TAFA family, and the pairwise amino acid sequence identity between FAM19A4 and
FAM19A3 is 80%. To determine the speciﬁcity of sandwich ELISA,
we transfected separate pCDNA3.1B plasmids containing human
FAM19A3, human FAM19A4, murine FAM19A3 and murine
Fam19a4 into HEK293T cells, the supernatant was harvested and
detected by the ELISA. Supplementary Fig. S1D shows that the
sandwich ELISA can recognize both human and murine FAM19A3
secretory protein while fail to detect FAM19A4 in the supernatant.
Collectively, FAM19A3 appears to represent a novel secreted
protein. The putative mature secreted form of FAM19A3 has 103
amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 11269Da and an
isoelectric point of 10.79.
3.2. Ischemic stroke induced FAM19A3 mRNA expression changes are
consistent with M2 polarization makers
Expression proﬁle analysis suggested that, in human normal tissues, FAM19A3 was only relatively highly expressed in brain and to

470

a lesser extent in the fetal liver (Fig. 1A), suggesting its potentially
important role in the neurobiology. Also the expression proﬁle in
mice was highly analogous in man (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, expression level of FAM19A3 in the brain was elevated beginning
1–3 days after MCAO and peaked by 5 days, then began to decrease
at 7 days after MCAO and returned to pre-injury level by day 14
(Fig. 1C). To our surprise, the levels of M2-type genes including
CD206, IL-10, Ym1/2, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and
IL-4 were to some extent in line with expression pattern of
FAM19A3, especially IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-b (Supplementary
Figs. S2A and S3A). In contrast, the mRNA expressions of all the
tested M1 markers (CD16, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-a) were gradually
increased over time from day 3 onward post ischemia injury
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore, FAM19A3 expression in
the mouse brain was detected by immunohistochemistical staining, FAM19A3 was highly expressed in the microglia in the mouse
brain after MCAO as compared with the sham group (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, these data for the ﬁrst time indicated that
FAM19A3 might be a M2-type candidate gene in microglia and
play a signiﬁcant role in the reaction to the cerebral ischemia.
3.3. FAM19A3 expression and secretion in the microglia are
differentially regulated by M1/M2 stimuli
To determine whether FAM19A3 is critical in microglia polarization, we next performed real-time PCR for FAM19A3 in induced
polarized M1 and M2 microglia in vitro using lipopolysaccharide
(100 ng/mL) plus IFNc (20 ng/mL) or IL-4 (20 ng/mL), respectively.
Time course experiments revealed that FAM19A3 mRNA expression was gradually increased between 6 and 12 h and maintained
for at least 24 h after treatment with M2 stimuli (IL-4) (Fig. 2A).
Conversely, treatment with M1 stimuli (LPS plus IFNc) caused a
transient and slight increase in FAM19A3 expression in the ﬁrst

6 h, followed by a signiﬁcant reduction in expression between 12
and 24 h and nearly returned to control level at the 24 h post stimulation (Fig. 2B). These differential effects on FAM19A3 mRNA
expression were correspondent to the secretion level of FAM19A3
by ELISA (Fig. 2C and D).
3.4. FAM19A3 modulates the microglia/macrophage M2/M1
polarization dynamics in vitro
To study the function of FAM19A3 in the process of microglia
polarization, we ﬁrst stimulated the microglia with recombinant
FAM19A3 for 24 h. Using real-time PCR, we found that the levels
of M2-type genes (CD206, IL-10, Ym1/2, TGF-b and IL-4) were augmented in FAM19A3 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3B). On the contrary, the mRNA expressions of all the
tested M1 markers, including CD16, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-a were signiﬁcantly decreased, in FAM19A3-dose dependent as well (Fig. 3B).
Because FAM19A3 induced the M2 and inhibited the M1
phenotype of microglia, we next sought to determine whether
recombinant FAM19A3 regulates inﬂammatory genes expression
in microglia differentiated M2 macrophages. For these studies,
microglia were ﬁrst treated with IL-4 for 24 h and then LPS plus
IFNc were added for 12 h with or without recombinant FAM19A3.
Intriguingly, IL-4 pretreatments for M2 induction can inhibit LPS
plus IFNc-mediated M1 (CD16 and iNOS) induction and proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a) secretion. Besides, this inhibitory effect was strongly augmented in a recombinant FAM19A3
additive manner (Fig. 3C).
3.5. FAM19A3 attenuates cerebral ischemia in the mice MCAO model
It is well established that the M2 microglia/macrophages are
protective cells and reduce production of inﬂammatory mediators

[17,18]. To determine whether FAM19A3 is of functional relevance
in the standard murine stroke model, infarct volumes of FAM19A3
treatment group and ‘‘MCAO + Vehicle’’ group were compared.
Infarct volumes were assessed after 7 days of MCAO by TTC staining. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with 1 or 10 lg FAM19A3 (i.p.)
resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of infarct volume compared to
the vehicle group in a dose-dependent manner. Although there
was a tendency toward smaller infarct volumes in 0.1 lg FAM19A3
(i.p.) group when compared to the vehicle group, no signiﬁcant difference was detected.
To examine the protective effect of FAM19A3 on neuronal cells,
we next compared neuronal cell death among the groups detected
by double staining of NeuN and TUNEL. A marked number of TUNEL-positive neuronal cells were observed in the peri-infarct cortex
of vehicle group. In contrast, FAM19A3 signiﬁcantly reduced the
number of TUNEL-positive neuronal cells compared to the vehicle
group in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B and C), IL-4 treatment
was served as a positive control.
3.6. FAM19A3 maintains the M2 microglia/macrophage polarization
properties in the mice MCAO model
To further decipher FAM19A3 protective role in the mice MCAO
model, mRNA expressions of M2-type genes (CD206, IL-10, Ym1/2
and TGF-b) and M1-type genes (CD16, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-a) in the
murine brains were assessed. Intriguingly, compared with the
‘‘MCAO + Vehicle’’ group, M2 markers were maintained at high
level in FAM19A3 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Otherwise,
the mRNA expressions of M1 markers were inhibited by FAM19A3,
also dose dependently (Fig. 5B).
Consistent with the real-time PCR results, the number of CD16/
32-positive Iba1+ microglia/macrophage was dose dependently
decreased in FAM19A3 treatment groups (Fig. 5C and E). In con-

trast, a signiﬁcant increase of CD206-positive Iba1+ microglia/macrophage was observed in FAM19A3 treatment groups in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5D and F). Taken together, FAM19A3 ameliorated cerebral ischemia in the mice MCAO model via maintenance of protective M2 microglia/macrophage polarization
properties and inhibition of deleterious M1 microglia/macrophage
polarization properties.
4. Discussion
Previous studies demonstrated that FAM19A3 is predominantly
expressed in the central nervous system, suggesting its potentially
important role in the neurobiology [14,19]. In our current study,
FAM19A3 was only relatively highly expressed in brain tissue in
both man and mice, which conﬁrmed the ﬁndings in the previous
studies [14,19]. More importantly, our data demonstrated that the
expression proﬁle of FAM19A3 in the mice MCAO model at different time points showed that responding dynamics of FAM19A3 in
brain tissue was orchestrated with the kinetics of microglia/macrophage polarization after stroke [12]. That is to say, dynamic
FAM19A3 response to cerebral ischemia was correspondent with
the M2-type genes including CD206, IL-10, Ym1/2 and TGF-b,
whereas went opposite way with M1 markers such as CD16, iNOS,
IL-6 and TNF-a. Furthermore, FAM19A3 was highly expressed in
the microglia in the mouse brain after MCAO as compared with
the sham group. In addition, both mRNA expression and protein
secretion of FAM19A3 in microglia were promoted by M2 stimuli.
Taken together, these data for the ﬁrst time indicated that
FAM19A3 might be a M2-type candidate gene and affect microglia
M2-to-M1 shift in the reaction to the cerebral ischemia.
Microglia/macrophages are the primary mediators of the
innate immune response to cerebral ischemia [20]. Recent
research provides strong evidence for dual microglial roles, both

beneﬁcial and deleterious. A large body of evidence have shown
that microglia/macrophage M2 polarization beneﬁts the injured
brain by removing cellular debris and restoring tissue integrity
[21,22]. Otherwise, several studies have also stated that M1
microglia release proinﬂammatory mediators that contribute to
neuronal dysfunction and cell death [20,23]. In fact, during the
physiopathological process, microglia/macrophages respond
dynamically to cerebral ischemia, migrating or inﬁltrating into
the infarct areas. Microglia/macrophages expressed the early
‘‘good’’ M2 phenotype after ischemia injury, but this was gradually replaced by the ‘‘bad’’ M1 phenotype at the site of injury
without any treatment intervention [12]. As a result, microglia/
macrophages exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium within the
lesion environment. The fate that they differentiate into M1 phonotype to exacerbate tissue injury or M2 phonotype to promote

tissue repair largely depends on signals in the microenvironment.
However, the signals that manipulate the M2 or M1 macrophage
polarization are still far from elucidation. Our results showed that
recombinant FAM19A3 alone was able to induce microglia M2
polarization and inhibit microglia M1 polarization. More importantly, recombinant FAM19A3 could block microglia M2-to-M1
transit and maintain the M2 polarization status even in the
well-established M1 polarization induction condition. FAM19A3
alone was also capable of suppressing proinﬂammatory genes in
induced M1 microglia/macrophages. In particular, the observation
that FAM19A3 enhanced the ability of IL-4 to inhibit M1 targets
such as CD16, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-a suggested that FAM19A3
could also be of great importance in suppression of proinﬂammatory genes in M2 microglia/macrophages or M1/M2 microglia/
macrophages in transit.

Fig. 4. FAM19A3 attenuates cerebral ischemia in the mice MCAO model. (A) Effects of recombinant FAM19A3 on brain infarct in the mice MCAO model. Representative
images (TTC staining, white area represents the infarct area, n = 8 per group) were shown in each group. The control group treated with the vehicle; dose groups treated with
recombinant FAM19A3 0.1, 1 or 10 lg/day by intraperitoneal injection. IL-4 (10 lg/day) was used as the positive control. (B) Representative photomicrographs of cerebral
slices double-stained with NeuN and TUNEL in the peri-infarct cortex. Scale bar: 50 lm. (C) Quantitative analysis of TUNEL-positive neurons in the peri-infarct cortex, n = 8
per group, ⁄P < 0.05 vs. vehicle.

It is thus tempting to speculate that FAM19A3 exerts a positive
inﬂuence on the cerebral ischemia by triggering and sustaining the
microglia/macrophage M2 phenotype. In support of this hypothe-

sis, administration of recombinant FAM19A3 also attenuated cerebral ischemia in the mice MCAO model and suppressed neuronal
cells death in a dose-dependent manner. These beneﬁcial effects

were associated with maintenance of M2 microglia/macrophage
polarization dynamics and blockage of M2 to M1 transit in vivo.
Taken together, FAM19A3 might be a crucial regulation signal controlling the dynamic equilibrium between M1 and M2 microglia/
macrophages, and thus advance our knowledge of cerebral infarction and contribute to novel therapy.
However, many questions still remain about FAM19A3 regulation role in M1/M2 polarization and the phenotypic shift during
stroke progression. The mechanism of FAM19A3 function in
microglia/macrophages polarization is still not clear. The preliminary data presented here showed that FAM19A3 dose dependently
increased expression of IL-4 which is commonly used in induction
of M2 microglia/macrophage polarization, indicating that
FAM19A3 might modulate microglia/macrophage polarization
dynamics via IL-4 signaling. In addition, a synergetic effect of
FAM19A3 and IL-4 in suppression of proinﬂammatory genes may
suggest that FAM19A3 could enhance IL-4 signaling or act in an
alternative signal pathway. Future studies will thus need to be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for FAM19A3 in
M1 and M2 polarization modulation and thus ameliorating the
cerebral ischemia in IL-4 (or IL-4R alpha)-deﬁcient mice.
In summary, we identiﬁed FAM19A3 as a signiﬁcantly induced
gene of microglia in the mice MCAO model. FAM19A3 mRNA
expression changes were consistent with M2 polarization markers.
That FAM19A3 expression and secretion were promoted by M2
stimuli further conﬁrmed FAM19A3 a M2-type candidate gene. In
addition, recombinant FAM19A3 was able to promote microglia
M2 polarization and inhibit microglia M1 polarization. Moreover,
administration of recombinant FAM19A3 also attenuated cerebral
ischemia in the mice MCAO model and maintained the M2 microglia/macrophage polarization dynamics. Taken together, our ﬁndings to our best of knowledge for the ﬁrst time support the
notion that FAM19A3, a novel secreted protein, modulates the
kinetics of microglia/macrophage polarization respond dynamically to ischemia injury and displays the protection property in
cerebral ischemia, and thus may lead to a better understanding
of the therapeutic effects of FAM19A3 in stroke therapy.
