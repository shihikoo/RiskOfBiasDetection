Abstract MicroRNAs are a class of noncoding small RNAs
that regulate gene expression by inhibiting target genes at
post-transcriptional levels. MicroRNAs have been highlighted
in many organs and tissues, including the brain. To identify
special microRNAs involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury,
we performed a comprehensive small RNA profiling in rat
model and the control using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. A total of 9,444,562 and 10,290,391 clean reads
were sequenced from two small RNA libraries constructed,
respectively. Three hundred fifty-eight known microRNAs
were identified, in which 78 microRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression between model and control. In
addition, 62 and 68 novel miRNAs were found in model and
control, respectively. Comparative analysis showed that 24
novel microRNAs were differentially expressed with greater
than six-fold change. The GO annotation suggested that predicted targets of microRNAs were enriched into the category
of metabolic process, cell part, cell-extracellular communications, and so on. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that these
genes were involved in many important pathways, mainly
including signaling transduction, MAPK signaling pathway,
NF-κB signaling pathway, and neurotrophin signaling pathway. Our findings provided a deeper understanding to the
regulatory mechanism of microRNAs underlying cerebral
ischemia, therefore benefitting the improvement of the
protection and treatment strategies of this disease.

Introduction
Brain ischemia is one of the most common and significant
causes of disability and death in the world. Ischemic preconditioning (IP) could trigger temporal change of gene expression in the cerebral, and a concomitant altered expression of
proteins which protects the brain during a subsequent ischemic injury (Dhodda et al. 2004; Dirnagl et al. 2009). However,
when the obstruction is removed and blood flow reestablished, the ischemic tissue is threatened by ischemiareperfusion injury (IRI). The elaborated mechanisms of IRI
are not well known. The disability and survival rates could be
improved by a better understanding to the molecular mechanisms of IRI, which may also lead to development of superior
targeted therapies.
Small RNAs (sRNAs) are endogenous and low molecular
weight RNAs with multiple regulatory functions, in which
microRNAs (miRNAs) have been paid much attention because miRNAs play a pivotal role in regulatory function at
post-transcriptional levels. miRNAs generally contain 19–24
nucleotides (nt) which are cleaved from precursor miRNA
(pre-miRNA) of 70–80 nt (Bartel 2004). Active miRNAs
may regulate gene expression through imperfect pairing
with 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of target mRNAs
(Carrington and Ambros 2003), therefore, regulating diverse
biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle,
apoptosis, immune response, and cellular response to stress
(Witwer et al. 2010; Hwang and Mendell 2006; Tili et al.
2007; Zhao et al. 2007). There is increasing evidence that gene
expression regulation mediated by miRNAs is widespread and
critical in mammals. Additionally, miRNA has been proved to
play an important role in the development brain and diseases
related to brain. Several reports have begun to characterize
miRNA expression profiles after cerebral ischemia using microarrays, inferring that miRNAs may be involved in the
pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Lee et al. proved that

672

miR-200 family and miR-182 family were upregulated at 3 h
after early IP (Lee et al. 2010). Lusardi et al. detected miRNA
expression in mouse cortex response to IP, ischemic
injury, and tolerance (Lusardi et al. 2010). They found that
273, 144, and 50 miRNAs were significantly changed in
preconditioned, ischemic, and tolerant cortex, respectively.
Recently, the massively parallel sequencing is developed to
get a high-throughput profile of miRNA expression (Xie et al.
2011). Illumina high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) has been
utilized to discover miRNAs in several species (Bar et al.
2008; Morin et al. 2008), owing to its high-throughput,
high-repeatability, and low signal-to-noise ratio (Zhao et al.
2007). Currently, while HiSeq is used as a powerful tool for
the identification of miRNAs profiling in various organisms
(Chen et al. 2012; Farazi et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2012), no such
analysis to date has been performed to identify miRNAs
expression in cerebral ischemia. Here, we present comprehensive miRNA profiles of the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model at 24 h after IRI using HiSeq, providing
a resource that could serve as a basis for establishing gene
regulatory interactions between miRNAs and their target
mRNAs in cerebral ischemia.

Methods
Transient Focal Ischemia
The transient MCAO model was induced in adult male rats
(260–300 g) under halothane anesthesia by intraluminal filament method (Xu et al. 2006; Vakili and Zahedikhorasani
2007). The animals were cared for in accordance with the
guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. In brief, rats
were anesthetized by 7.2 % chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg body
weight). A 3-0 nylon suture with its tip rounded by heating
near a flame was introduced into the internal carotid artery
through a nick given in the external carotid artery and advanced 18–20 mm from the common carotid artery bifurcation
to block the origin of middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 2 h
of MCA occlusion, the intraluminal suture was gently removed to allow reperfusion. AT 24 h of IRI, ischemic brains
were collected and stored at −80 C.
Small RNA Library Preparation and HiSeq
The total RNA was extracted from the IRI model and control
rats using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the provided protocols. The quality and concentration of total RNA were monitored by gel electrophoresis
and absorbance at A260/280 ratio. Subsequently, 20 μg RNA
was used to separate to 15 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) gel, and the 18–30 nt fraction of RNA
was excised from the gel and purified. Next, 3′- and 5′-

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:671–683

adapters were ligated to the 3′- and 5′-terminals of these
sRNA, respectively. The ligated products were purified and
reverse converted to cDNAs by RT-PCR to produce sRNA
libraries. Finally, the libraries were sequenced using an
Illumina sequencer (HiSeq 2000) at Beijing Genomics institution (BGI) (Beijing, China).
Sequence Analysis
After sequencing, the original image figure was converted into
sequence data by the base calling step. Such sequence data
were called raw reads. Raw reads were disposed of some
contaminant reads, including low-quality reads, 5′-primer
contaminants, small no insert tags, and poly A tags, and then
the final data were named as clean reads. Afterwards, clean
reads from 18 to 30 nt summarized the length distribution of
these clean reads. Subsequently, clean reads identified the type
and number of small RNA (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA,
and other ncRNA) using NCBI GenBank noncoding RNA
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/) and Rfam
database (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/).
Repeat overlapping sequences were annotated as repeatassociated small RNA using the tag2repeat software developed by BGI. After eliminating repetitive sequences, clean
small RNA sequences were aligned with the miRNA
precursor/mature miRNA of rat database in miRBase
(http://www.mirbase.org/index.shtml) to identify conserved
miRNA. Only perfectly or near-perfectly (1–2 mismatches)
matching sequences were considered as conserved miRNA.
Those which cannot be annotated will be identified as novel
miRNA using Mireap software (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/mireap/) basing on the secondary structure, the
Dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the nonannotated small RNA tags that could be mapped to the genome. The conserved and novel miRNAs were mapped to
chromosomes using Short Oligonucleotide Alignment
Program (SOAP) software to analyze their expression and
distribution.
Differential Expression Analysis of miRNAs
For differential expression analysis, the frequency of miRNAs
from the IRI model and control was normalized using the
formula as follows: normalized expression=actual miRNA
count/total count of clean reads×1,000,000. If the expression
of miRNA gene in two samples was zero, then it was revised
to 0.01. If the miRNA gene expression was less than 1, thus it
did not participate in the analysis of differential expression
because of a too-low expression. Finally, the fold-change and
P value basing on the normalized expression value were
calculated.
Cluster analysis could cluster miRNA with similar expression patterns together. In cluster figure, red indicates that the

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:671–683

miRNA has higher expression in treatment sample than in
control, while green indicates that the miRNA has lower
expression in treatment than in control. Gray indicates that
the miRNA has no expression in at least one sample.
qRT-PCR Validation for Differentially Expressed miRNAs
To confirm the expression of miRNAs from deep-sequencing
data, qRT-PCR was used to analyze differentially expressed
miRNAs in the present study. Total RNA was extracted using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Then, 1 μg total RNA was
reverse transcribed into cDNA using an NCodeTM VILOTM
miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The reactions were
carried out on the LightCycle 480II (Roche) using the
NCodeTM EXPRESS SYBR GreenERTM miRNA qRT-PCR
Kit (Invitrogen), including 2× SuperMix, 25 μM ROX
Reference Dye, 10 μM specific primer, 10 μM general primer
and 2 μl cDNA. The 50-μl reaction mixtures were incubated
in 96 plates at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, followed by
40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. The small
RNA U6 was used as an internal control. All reactions were
performed in triplicate. The relative expression of miRNA
compared with U6 was determined using the 2−ΔΔCT method.
Target Prediction for miRNAs
RNAhybrid was used to predict the target genes of known
miRNAs, complying with two criteria in seed region. A
criterion was no mismatch between 2 and 8 nt at the 5′-end.
The second criterion was that G-U was permitted, but the
number cannot exceed 3. The miRNA for target prediction
can be flexibly chosen from the following three data: differential expressed miRNA (both known miRNA and novel
miRNA), predicted novel miRNA, and identified known
miRNA. Target prediction of differential expressed miRNA
can be used to find the genes regulated by those miRNA.
Target prediction of predicted novel miRNA can be used to
verify the novel miRNA predicted by BGI pipeline. New
target sites or new target genes are usually concerned in target
prediction of identified known miRNA. The minimum free
energy (MFE) of the duplex formed by miRNA and target
should be ≥75 % of the MFE of the miRNA bound to its
perfect complement.
GO Enrichment and KEGG Pathway Analysis
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment, an international standardized classification system for gene function, was used to
analyze the predicted target genes of miRNA. There are three
ontologies in GO: molecular function, cellular component,
and biological process. The basic unit of GO is GO term, each
of which belongs to one type of ontology. It may provide GO
terms significantly enriched in the predicted target genes

673

involving corresponding biological functions. So the result
may reveal the functions significantly associated to predicted
target candidates of miRNAs.
This method maps all target candidates to GO terms in the
database (http://www.geneontology.org/), calculating gene
numbers, then using hypergeometric test to find significantly
enriched GO terms in target candidates comparing to the
reference background. The calculating formula is:
 

M
N −M
m−1
X
i
n−i
 
P ¼ 1−
N
i¼0
n
In the formula above, N is the number of all genes with GO
annotation; n is the number of target candidates in N; M is the
number of all genes that are annotated to a certain GO term; m
is the number of target candidates in M. A Bonferroni correction was used to get a corrected P value. The GO terms with P
values ≥0.5 were regarded as significantly enriched in the
target candidates.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway database http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) was also used
to further analyze the pathways of the miRNA targets. KEGG
pathway analysis may identify significantly enriched
metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in
target candidates comparing with the whole reference
gene background. The calculating formula is the same
as that in GO analysis. Here, N is the number of all
genes with KEGG annotation, n is the number of target gene
candidates in N, M is the number of all genes annotated to a
certain pathway, and m is the number of target gene candidates
in M. Genes with FDR≤0.05 are defined as significantly
enriched in target candidates. The KEGG analysis could
reveal the main pathways which the target gene candidates
are involved in.
RT-PCR for Targets
The expression of predicted targets (TNF-α and IL-1β)
was examined by RT-PCR. A 1-μg total RNA above
was reverse transcribed using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The gene was amplified using primers (TNF-α: Forward:
5′-tgcctcagcctcttctcatt-3′, Reverse: 5′-gtgggtgaggagcacgtagt-3′;
IL-1β: Forward: 5′-caggaaggcagtgtcactca-3′, Reverse: 5′gggattttgtcgttgcttgt-3′), respectively. The primer of β-actin
used as a control (Forward: 5′-tgacgttgacatccgtaaag-3′, reverse:
5′-acagtgaggccaggatagag-3′). Each amplification reaction
was performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl
cDNA, 0.5 μl primers, and 10 μl 2× Master mix. The PCR
products were analyzed on a 1.0 % agarose gel that was
stained with ethidium bromide.

Western Blotting
Total protein was isolated using a radio-immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, China), then the protein
concentration was measured using BCA assay (Beyotime,
China). Proteins were segregated on 10 % SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked using 5 % nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times with TBST, the
membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody
(Bcl-2 and Caspase 3) (Bioworld Technology, USA) or mouse
monoclonal β-actin antibody (ZSGB-BIO, China) overnight
at 4 °C. After washing for three times, the membranes were
incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish
peroxidase conjugated IgG at room temperature for 1 h.
Finally, washed three times in TBST, the member was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a
Western blotting luminological reagent (Beyotime, China).
β-actin served as a control and was determined following
the same procedure as above.

Results
High-Throughput Sequencing
For identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in rat
model of IRI compare to the control, we carried out highthroughput deep sequencing of sRNA using Illumina Genome
Analyzer. After HiSeq sequencing, two sets of raw data were
combined and analyzed using the miRCat pipeline (Table 1).
Firstly, they were got rid of meaningless reads, including
insert-null, 3′adapter-null, 5′adapter-contaminants, smallerthan-18 nt and polyA. A total of 9,444,562 and 10,290,391
clean reads were acquired in IRI model and in control,
occupied by 98.65 and 99.08 %, respectively. Then, we
analyzed the unique sRNAs sequences between the IRI

model and the control. As shown in Fig. 1a, 47,638
unique sRNA (14.91 %) was detected to be present in
both samples. 141,510 and 130,432 unique sRNA were
especially expressed in IRI model and in control, occupied
by 44.28 and 40.81 %, respectively. These results were indicated that there were indeed differences of sRNA between the
IRI model and the control.
The size distribution of sequenced sRNA was assessed. As
seen in Fig. 1b, the average length of reads was about 18–30
nucleotides (nt) in both libraries (>95 %). Obviously, a length
of the 22 nt class was the maximum number of total sRNAs,
following by the 23 nt and then the 21 nt reads. Moreover, it
was calculated that the 22 nt reads were occupied by 59.53
and 57.75 % of total reads in IRI model and in control,
respectively. These results were consistent with previous reports in which 22 nt of sRNA was the most abundant and 22 nt
was a typical size range of mature miRNAs from Dicer
digestion products.
The type and number of sRNA were searched basing on
sequence similarity using specific databases (rRNAs, tRNA,
sn/snoRNAs, miRNAs, other noncoding RNAs). Figure 1c
listed an overview of sRNA gene expression in normal control
(left) and IRI model (right). The pie-chart represented 11 kinds
of sRNA, in which miRNAs constitute the majority in control
(7,999,994/10,290,391 = 77.74 %) and IRI (7,145,027/
9,444,562=75.65 %) samples, implying that mRNAs could
play more important roles than other sRNAs at the level
of regulation. These results shown that miRNAs with
different number in IRI model and control might perform different functions during developmental stages of
cerebral ischemia.
Identification and Analysis of Known miRNA
It is well known that a great majority of miRNAs are conserved among species. Based on the results from HiSeq of
sRNAs in the present study, we firstly identified known
miRNAs by alignment to designated part of miRBase
(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk). Three hundred sixty
conserved miRNAs were showed to match the known rat
miRNA data. The largest miRNA family was Rno-let-7 including 12 members, followed by Rno-miR-30, Rno-miR181, Rno-miR-29, Rno-miR-26 and Rno-miR-34, which
was composed of 10, 8, 6, 6, and 5 members, respectively.
Furthermore, we detected that these six miRNA families were
the most highly conserved in 98 compared species, including
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus
laevis, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, suggesting that
the ancient regulation mediated by conserved miRNAs was
also functional in cerebral ischemia.
In the present study, differently expressed miRNA was
regarded as significant if the fold change was greater than 1
or less than −1. A total of 66 miRNAs were identified to be

RNAs sequences between samples. A total of 47,638 (14.91 %) unique
sRNA was common present in both samples, while 130,432 (40.81 %)
unique sRNA and 141,510 (44.28 %) sRNA were specially expressed in
control and in IRI model, respectively. All values presented in the figure
were calculated based on the total sequence reads. b Length distribution
of sequences short sRNAs from control and IRI samples. sRNA reads
with a length of 22 nt were the most abundant, then followed by 23 and
21 nt reads. The horizontal axis means the length (nt) of sequence, and the

vertical means the frequency percentage (%). c Frequency of different
classes of RNA in sRNA libraries. The sequences obtained in sequencing
were subjected to search the kind and number of sRNA basing on
sequence similarity using specific databases (rRNAs, tRNA, sn/
snoRNAs, miRNAs, other noncoding RNAs). The pie-charts represent
an overview of small RNA gene expression in control and apelin. Small
RNAs belonging to the miRNA family constitute the majority as in
control (7,999,994/10,290,391=77.74 %) (left) and IRI (7,145,027/
9,444,562=75.65 %) samples (right)

differentially expressed (Fig. 2a), in which 64 were downregulated and only 2 upregulated. Table 2 was listed a part of the
differently expressive miRNAs between the control and
IRI model. In comparison to the control, Rno-miR-1298
and Rno-miR-138-2 were downregulated with approximately four-fold changes. Rno-miR-375, Rno-miR-1912,
Rno-miR-34b, and Rno-miR-874 represented about a
three-fold change. However, there were only two miRNAs,
rno-miR-503-3p and rno-miR-23a-5p, which were detected
to be upregulated. The results suggested that abnormal
mRNAs could play important roles in regulating cerebral
ischemia.
The clustering based on the relative expression frequencies of miRNAs also indicated that miRNA expression was different in IRI model and control. All differentially expressed miRNAs were clustered in a one by five
cluster (Fig. 3a).

Predict Novel miRNA
Except for detecting known conserved miRNAs, HiSeq has a
notable advantage for discovering functionally novel miRNAs
that are not detected using microarray. Basing on the hairpin
structure of pre-miRNA and dicer digestion site, novel
miRNA was predicted from unannotated sRNAs in this study.
The length of most novel miRNA was also 22 nt. Figure 4
listed the first nucleotide of bias of novel miRNA in IRI model
and in control. Guanine (G) was the maximum number of
nucleotides, occupied with 47.24 and 39.42 % in IRI model
and in control, following cytosine (C) occupied with 47.78
and 38.57 %, respectively (Table 3). In fact, there were differences in the nucleotide distribution and abundance of
sRNA in the two samples.
For novel miRNAs, 68 were found in the control and 62 in
the IRI model. The precursor length of these novel miRNA was

respectively. Red points represent up-expressed miRNAs with foldchange>2; green points represent down-expressed miRNAs with foldchange<1/2; blue points represent miRNAs with 1/2<fold-change<2

from 69 to 100 nt and the minimal folding free energy varied
from −19.00 to −57.60 kcal/mol. Among them, 24 miRNAs
were showed to be differently expressed with greater than sixfold change, in which 11 miRNAs were upregulated and 13
were downregulated in the IRI model compared to in the control
((Fig. 2b, Table 4). In the present study, the higher expression
level of novel miRNAs compared to known miRNAs was
speculated to be because novel miRNAs must play significantly
role in the regulatory network of cerebral ischemia.
The clustering of novel miRNAs also suggested that
there were obvious difference of miRNA expression

between IRI model and control. All differentially expressed
miRNAs were grouped in one by three subclusters
(Fig. 3b).

present study, 34,279 putative genes were predicted to be the
target of 66 differentially known miRNAs and theses genes
were mapped on 322,498 loci. Similarly, for 24 novel
differential miRNAs, 31,433 target genes located on
139,397 loci were predicted. Figure 6 listed the predicted
binding sites at the 3′-UTR of target and rno-miR-375-3p and
rno-miR-500-3p using Mireap software, respectively. The maximum folding energy was −22.5 kcal/mol and −19.6 kcal/mol,
respectively.
Table 5 listed a few predicted target genes of known and
novel miRNAs, including IL-15 (Interleukin 15), CLCA2
(chloride channel family member 2), cyclin G1, GDF9
(growth differentiation factor 9), PDCD1 (programmed cell
death protein 1), N-myc proto-oncogene protein. These genes
were related to the immune response, cell signaling, cell cycle,
apoptosis and so on, implying that miRNAs involved in
regulating the physiological and pathological processes of
cerebral ischemia targeting these genes.
To determine the expression of target genes, RT-PCR and
western blotting were used in this study. As shown in Fig. 7a,
the mRNA expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was significantly increased in IRI model compared with control, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7b, the expression of Bcl-2 and
caspase 3 at protein level was also obviously enhanced in
the IRI model.

We also found that most miRNAs had multiple potential
target genes, while some unigene also may be targeted by
more than one miRNA. The further analysis of these targets
would help us to elaborate the important role of miRNAs
among the cerebral ischemia. However, bioinformatic predictions of target mRNA need to be further experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo.
GO Analysis
To further analyze the biological implications of differential
miRNA, we appraised miRNA target genes in GO category
which is one of the most useful methods for annotation and
classification of genes. GO category is composed of biological
process, cellular component, and molecular function. For different miRNAs in the present study, the predicted target genes
could be grouped into 52 categories, in which 23 genes were
grouped into biological process, 15 belonged to cellular component, and 14 belonged to molecular function, respectively.

qRT-PCR. Known miRNAs including rno-miR-23a, rno-miR-138, rnomiR-34b, and rno-miR-1298 were used to perform expression analysis by
qRT-PCR. The expressive comparison of miRNA between highthroughput sequencing and qRT-PCR results indicated that there is better
correlation between two methods

molecular transducer activity (GO:0060089). These results
were indicated in that the targets of miRNA in IRI involved
in a wide variety of physiological processes.
KEGG Pathway Analysis
To evaluate the biological pathways involved in IRI, we also
analyzed KEGG pathway of the differentially expressed
genes. The KEGG Pathway analysis indicated 20,870 target
genes that were annotated for 304 biological processes with
P<1, and most of target genes were involved in metabolic
pathway, interaction and signal transduction. As shown in
Table 6, the top-enriched pathway was the metabolic pathways, with 2,168 annotated genes representing 10.39 %,

Discussion
Illumina high-throughput sequencing has been used as a powerful tool for the identification of miRNAs and was successfully used in a variety of studies. Liu et al. identified the
miRNAs in goat skin by Deep Sequencing (Liu et al. 2012).
They found that 68 miRNAs were conserved in goat and had
been reported in NCBI. Two hundred forty-eight miRNAs

Table 6 The most enriched
KEGG pathways of target genes
for differentially expressed
miRNAs

were conserved in other species but had not been reported in
goat. Except for known miRNAs, 22 novel miRNAs were also
detected. Deep sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA
expression profiles of human laryngeal epithelial cells infected by adenovirus type 3 (AD3) (Qi et al. 2010). A total of 44
miRNAs demonstrated higher expression and 36 miRNAs
showed lower expression in the AD3-infected cells than control, indicating miRNAs involved in the infection of AD3.
In the present study, we evaluated the change of miRNAs
profile after IRI. A total of 66 conserved miRNAs were
differentially expressed, in which 64 were downregulated
and only 2 upregulated. Especially, it need to pay more attention to six miRNAs with fold-change>3.0, including RnomiR-1298, Rno-miR-138-2-3p, Rno-miR-375-3p, Rno-miR1912-3p, Rno-miR-34b-3p, and Rno-miR-874-3p. MiRNA138 was found to be reduced in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) specimens and was demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor in GBM tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential application in GBM therapy (Qiu et al. 2013). It was found that
miR-375 expression was significantly decreased in glioma
tissues and the low miR-375 expression was significantly
associated with advanced pathological grade (Chang et al.
2012). It was revealed that intestinal ischemia induced a
time-dependent increase of miR-874 expression, implying
that miRNA-874 was involved in the intestinal ischemia
(Zhi et al. 2014). MiRNA-34b/c was detected to be downregulated at the early stage of Parkinson’s disease brains, indicating miRNA-34b/c as a diagnostic marker of Parkinson’s disease (Minones-Moyano et al. 2011). However, there were no

related reports of miR-1298 and miR-1912. It was suggested
that these miRNAs might be especially involved in the protective role after IRI. Therefore, we next plan to confirm their
protective function using experimental methods.
HiSeq has indicated that it is reliable not only for appraisal
of known miRNAs but also for discovery of novel miRNAs
that are not detected using other methods. In the present study,
HiSeq discovered 68 novel miRNAs in control and 62 in the
IRI model, respectively. Eleven miRNAs were obviously
upregulated and 13 were downregulated in the IRI model
compared to control. The discovery of novel miRNAs will
be beneficial for us to fully understand the function of miRNA
after IRI.
MiRNA mainly controls the target mRNAs, thus fulfilling
the upstream regulation to the basic activities of cells and
tissues. Therefore, the prediction of target genes should be
of significance in elucidating the miRNA function. MiR-497
was especially induced after transient ischemia and miR-497
overexpression increased neuronal loss (Yin et al. 2010). The
directly targets of miR-497 were Bcl-2/-w which attenuated
brain infarction and improved neurological outcome after
focal ischemia. Lusardi et al. revealed that miR-132 directly
regulated methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein
expression which acted as an effector of IP-induced tolerance
in rat cortical neurons (Lusardi et al. 2010). In the present
study, 34,279 putative targets for 66 differentially known
miRNAs were predicted and 322,498 targets for 24 differentially novel miRNAs. A particular interest was the gene
associated with immune response (IL-6, IL-15, TNF-a),
cell signalling (CLCA2, E2F2, eIF-4F), cell cycle (cyclin G1, CDK1, MAPK4), apoptosis (PDCD1, caspase3, PCD8, Fas), growth (NGFR, TGIF, VEGF), indicating
that miRNAs exert their roles by repressing multiple targets
involved in important activities in the pathological processes
of cerebral ischemia.
We all know that the prediction of miRNA targets is not
enough using only bioinformatics. miRNA targets should be
performed by miRNA transfection and a luciferase assay.
Next, we will carry out these experiments to verify whether
the predicted targets are the miRNA targets.
GO analysis revealed that 44.3 % of the genes were annotated to biological processes, 28.8 % of the genes were composed of cellular component, and 26.9 % of the genes
belonged to molecular function. These genes ranged from
genes encoding enzymes catalyzing biological metabolism
to genes encoding protein kinase participating in signal transduction, genes regulating the transcription and translation, to
genes consisting member part, and genes regulating response
to external stimuli. GO analysis proved that predicted targets
of miRNAs were involved in a wide variety of biological
processes. Intriguingly, apoptosis-related factors, antiapoptotic factor, inflammatory factors, and receptors related
to cerebral ischemia were also enriched from the predicted

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:671–683

targets, indicating that these targets play important roles in the
pathological process of cerebral ischemia.
For KEGG pathway analysis, some classic pathways reported to involve in brain activity were also identified in the
present study, including MAPK signaling pathway, calcium
signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and so on. Kovalska et al. studied the change of
intracellular MAPK signaling pathway after cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury. The highest expression of the
pERK was displayed at 24 h after ischemia, while the lowest
level of p38 was detected at the same time, suggesting that the
MAPK signal transduction might have a potential role in
cerebral ischemia (Kovalska et al. 2012). NF-kappaB is a
transcription factor that regulates inflammatory and apoptotic
pathways in cerebral ischemia (Schwaninger et al. 2006).
Guan et al. reported that ruscogenin had a protection against
ischemic damage caused by MCAO, and this role may be
through downregulation of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory
responses (Guan et al. 2013). Chemokine signaling pathway
plays a key role in the inflammatory response of ischemia.
CXCR3 ligands may mediate recruitment of Th1 cells. On the
other hand, CC chemokines induced mononuclear cell infiltration and macrophage activation (Frangogiannis 2007).
Neurotrophins signaling may prevent the apoptosis of neurons
through the tyrosine kinase receptor following neuronal injury
(Kim et al. 2004). A large number of putative target genes and
signaling pathways were predicted using bioinformatics tools
in this study, but caution needs to be taken in summarizing and
interpreting the results owing to lack of experimental verification. It will be the focus on experimental validation of the
relationship between miRNAs and mRNA transcripts.

Conclusions
Illumina high-throughput sequencing offered a good platform
for the study of sRNAs in the pathological process of cerebral
ischemia. In the present study, we constructed two sRNA
libraries from IRI model at 2 h after ischemia and control,
and obtained high-quality miRNA expression profiles. A total
of 66 miRNAs showed significant difference between IRI
model and control. The identification of novel miRNAs
highlighted the important function of miRNAs that could not
be found using traditional methods. Target predictions for
differentially expressed miRNAs, functional annotations of
GO database and pathway analyses in KEGG database indicated that the regulation of genes targeted by miRNAs potentially
involved in the physiological and pathological process of cerebral ischemia. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of
the mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia. If the function
of different miRNAs has been determined, it will improve the
protection and treatment strategies of cerebral ischemia.
