and oligodendrocytes have been shown to contribute to remodeling
and recovery processes after stroke (5, 22–27).
To elucidate whether activation of neurons alone can promote
recovery, we used optogenetics to selectively manipulate the
excitability of specific cell groups with millisecond-scale temporal precision in a manner more similar to endogenous neuronal
firing patterns (21, 28, 29). This technique uses light-activated
microbial proteins such as Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2), which
depolarizes neurons when illuminated with blue light, or Halorhodopsin (NpHR), which hyperpolarizes neurons (21, 28, 29).
Optogenetic approaches have been used in rodents to probe neuronal circuits for several neurological/neurodegenerative diseases,
including Parkinson disease (30) and epilepsy (31). Recent studies
have also used optogenetics to map functional organization after
stroke (32–35). The safety and efficacy of using optogenetics in
nonhuman primates has also been characterized (29, 36).
In this study, we used optogenetics to selectively stimulate
neurons in layer V of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1)
and examine the effects of repeated neuronal stimulations in
normal and stroke mice. Sensory-motor behavior tests were used
to evaluate functional recovery after stroke, and plasticity-associated mechanisms, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF)/neurovascular coupling responses and activity-dependent neurotrophin
expression, were investigated.

troke is a major acute neurological insult that disrupts brain
function and causes neuron death. Functional recovery after
stroke has been observed and is currently attributed to both brain
remodeling and plasticity (1–4). Structural and functional remodeling
of areas next to an infarct or remote regions can alter signaling within
bilateral neuronal networks and thus contribute to functional recovery (3–7). Rewiring of neural connections is mediated by electrical
activity, which can activate a number of plasticity mechanisms, including the release of activity-dependent neurotrophins such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor
(NGF) (8–10). Both BDNF and NGF have been shown to improve
recovery by enhancing axonal and dendritic sprouting (10–12).
Tremendous effort has been focused on promoting recovery
after stroke, including pharmacological treatment, rehabilitation
(e.g., constraint-induced therapy), stem cell transplantation, and
brain stimulation (1, 4, 13). Brain stimulation is a promising area
of research because it allows direct activation and manipulation
of the target area’s excitability (14–16). The primary motor cortex
(M1) is a commonly stimulated area as it directly innervates the
corticospinal tract to initiate movement (1, 7). Although electrical
stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation show promise in
promoting recovery (17, 18), these techniques are limited by imprecision and indiscriminate activation or inhibition of all cell types
near the stimulated site; thus, they can produce undesired effects
such as psychiatric and motor/speech problems (19–21). In addition, it has been difficult to elucidate the cell type and mechanisms
driving recovery, as multiple cell types such as neurons, astrocytes,

Significance
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States and
has very limited treatment options. Brain stimulation techniques that promote recovery after stroke are a promising area
of research; however, current stimulation techniques nonspecifically activate/inhibit the target area, which not only
leads to undesired side effects but also makes it difficult to
understand which cell types and mechanisms drive recovery.
We used the optogenetic technique to specifically stimulate only
neurons after stroke and demonstrate that selective neuronal
stimulations can activate beneficial mechanisms and promote
recovery. Understanding the cell type and mechanisms driving
recovery may identify potential drug targets for stroke treatment, as well as ultimately help develop precise brain stimulation techniques for stroke therapy.

NEUROSCIENCE

Clinical and research efforts have focused on promoting functional
recovery after stroke. Brain stimulation strategies are particularly
promising because they allow direct manipulation of the target
area’s excitability. However, elucidating the cell type and mechanisms mediating recovery has been difficult because existing stimulation techniques nonspecifically target all cell types near the
stimulated site. To circumvent these barriers, we used optogenetics to selectively activate neurons that express channelrhodopsin 2 and demonstrated that selective neuronal stimulations in the
ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1) can promote functional
recovery. Stroke mice that received repeated neuronal stimulations exhibited significant improvement in cerebral blood flow
and the neurovascular coupling response, as well as increased expression of activity-dependent neurotrophins in the contralesional
cortex, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth
factor, and neurotrophin 3. Western analysis also indicated that
stimulated mice exhibited a significant increase in the expression
of a plasticity marker growth-associated protein 43. Moreover,
iM1 neuronal stimulations promoted functional recovery, as stimulated stroke mice showed faster weight gain and performed significantly better in sensory-motor behavior tests. Interestingly, stimulations in normal nonstroke mice did not alter motor behavior or
neurotrophin expression, suggesting that the prorecovery effect of
selective neuronal stimulations is dependent on the poststroke environment. These results demonstrate that stimulation of neurons in
the stroke hemisphere is sufficient to promote recovery.

primary motor cortex pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1A). An optical
fiber was stereotaxically implanted above layer V of iM1, and a
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used to
generate infarct in the striatum (Str) and somatosensory cortex
(S1). We first examined if reliable neuronal activation could be
achieved by our iM1 neuronal stimulation paradigm consisting
of three successive 1-min laser stimulations, separated by 3-min
rest intervals (Fig. 1 B and C). In vivo electrophysiological
optrode recording in iM1 indicated that this stimulation paradigm could generate reliable and consistent firing patterns in all
three stimulations (Fig. 1B), with individual spiking shown in
Fig. 1C. To demonstrate that iM1 stimulation could activate
peri-infarct areas and contralesional M1 (cM1), a dual recording was performed: an optrode in iM1 and a recording
electrode in either the ipsilesional striatum (iStr), ipsilesional
somatosensory cortex (iS1), or cM1. iM1 stimulation can induce
reliable firing in iS1 (Fig. 1D), iStr (Fig. 1E), and cM1 (Fig. 1F),
indicating that iM1 neuronal stimulation can activate peri-infarct
regions (Str and S1) as well as the cM1.
Repeated iM1 Neuronal Stimulations Enhanced Cerebral Blood Flow/
Neurovascular Coupling in Stroke Mice. To examine if repeated iM1

neuronal stimulation could activate plasticity-associated mechanisms and recovery, we implemented a repeated neuronal stimulation paradigm at poststroke days 5–14 (6 d/wk, see experimental
time line, Fig. 2A). We used five groups of Thy1-ChR2-YFP transgenic mice: sham, normal + nonstim, normal + stim, stroke +
nonstim, and stroke + stim (Fig. 2B). During the optogenetic

Fig. 2. Experimental design and time line. (A) Mice were handled and pretrained on several motor-sensory behavior tests before collecting baseline.
Preimplant baseline was collected 1 d before fiber optic cannula implant
surgery. Prestroke baseline was collected 1 d before stroke surgery (30-min
suture model). Optogenetic neuronal stimulation began at poststroke day 5.
Stimulation continued until poststroke day 14 (6 d/wk). Behavior tests were
performed on days 2, 7, 10, and 14. On poststroke day 15, one group of mice
was placed under anesthesia for CBF measurements and sacrificed that day.
Another group was sacrificed for qPCR studies or histology. At poststroke day
5, another group was used for CBF measurement and sacrificed that day
(indicated by dotted line). These mice were not used for behavior studies, as

neuronal stimulations, we observed visible forelimb movements in
the affected limb when the laser was turned on (Movie S1). This
indicates that our iM1 stimulations activate sufficient motoroutput neurons to generate movements in the affected forelimb.
We first examined whether repeated iM1 neuronal stimulations
increased CBF and neurovascular coupling response (Fig. 3).
Laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to measure changes in
CBF in sham, stroke + nonstim, and stroke + stim mice. The site
of stimulation, CBF measurement location, and stroke location
are indicated in the diagrams (Fig. 3). In the sham group, CBF
increased during the 1-min stimulation, followed by a significantly
larger increase during the 3-min poststimulation period in both the
contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres (Fig. 3A). Stroke
mice, however, despite significantly increased CBF with contralesional stimulation during the 1-min stimulation period, failed
to induce the large increase in CBF poststimulation in both contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres at poststroke day 5 (Fig.
S1). This is consistent with the current concept of an overall depressed excitability and blood flow throughout the brain after
stroke (37, 38). Interestingly, at poststroke day 15, stimulated
stroke mice exhibited an improved CBF/neurovascular coupling
response in the ipsilesional hemisphere (Fig. 3B), whereas nonstimulated stroke mice remained unresponsive to the 1-min laser
stimulation and exhibited no significant change in ipsilesional CBF
during and after the 1-min stimulation.
Repeated iM1 Neuronal Stimulations Increased Neurotrophin
Expressions in Stroke Mice. Next we investigated the effects of

repeated iM1 neuronal stimulation on neurotrophic factor expression, as a number of neurotrophic factors have been demonstrated to promote recovery poststroke (9, 11, 39). We examined
the expression of the activity-dependent neurotrophin family
(BDNF, NGF, and NTF3) at poststroke day 15. Quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed on iM1, cM1, iS1, and cS1 in all five
groups listed in Fig. 2B. The stroke areas and dissected regions

Repeated iM1 Neuronal Stimulations Increased Growth-Associated
Protein 43 Expressions in Stroke Mice. To examine whether re-

peated iM1 neuronal stimulation might be involved in poststroke
synaptic plasticity, we examined the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a plasticity marker involved in synaptic plasticity and reorganization after stroke (3, 4, 40). The
stroke areas and dissected regions (iM1, cM1, iS1, and cS1) are
outlined in Fig. 4A. Western blot analysis indicated that stimulated stroke mice exhibited a significant increase in GAP43
protein levels in the iS1 and the cM1 (Fig. 5), suggesting that
poststroke neuronal stimulations may enhance synaptic plasticity.
Repeated iM1 Neuronal Stimulations Promote Functional Behavioral
Recovery in Stroke Mice. To address whether repeated iM1 neu-

ronal stimulations can promote functional recovery, we evaluated the behavioral performance of stroke mice on the rotating
beam test, a sensitive and reproducible sensory-motor behavior
test used to detect neurological deficit after stroke (41). Baseline
performances were evaluated before stroke (day 0) and poststroke days 2, 7, 10, and 14. Body weight changes were also
monitored during this period as mice typically lose body weight
after stroke. Interestingly, stimulated mice regained their body
weight faster than nonstimulated mice at poststroke day 14 (Fig.
6A). Importantly, stimulated stroke mice also exhibited significant improvement in their motor-sensory function, traveling longer
distances at day 7 and 10 (Fig. 6B) and faster speeds at day 10 and
14 (Fig. 6C and Movies S2–S4). Infarct analysis indicated that
Cheng et al.

repeated iM1 neuronal stimulations did not alter infarct size (Fig.
S4). Interestingly, repeated neuronal stimulations in normal nonstroke mice did not alter or improve motor function (Fig. 6 D and
E), suggesting that the effect of neuronal stimulation in stroke mice
is dependent on the stroke environment. Stimulation also did not
have an effect on body weight in normal nonstroke mice (Fig. S5).
Furthermore, stimulation of a control cortical region—the contralesional M1—did not have an effect on functional recovery (Fig.
S6), indicating that the prorecovery effect of iM1 stimulation is
region dependent and not due to a general stimulation effect.
Discussion
Our results provide the first demonstration to our knowledge
that selective stimulation of neurons can enhance multiple
plasticity-associated mechanisms and promote recovery. Specifically, we demonstrate that stimulation of a noninfarct region,
iM1, can activate peri-infarct areas and the contralesional cortex
(Fig. 1). One form of cortical reorganization involves the balance
of interhemispheric interactions between the ipsilesional and the
contralesional motor cortex (1, 7). Interestingly, our data show
that iM1 neuronal stimulations caused significant increases of
multiple neurotrophins in the contralesional cortex in stroke
mice (Fig. 4), but not in normal nonstroke mice (Fig. S3), suggesting that stimulation-induced increases in neurotrophins are
dependent on the stroke environment. These increases in neurotrophins, possibly resulting from the interactions between the
two hemispheres after stimulation, further confirms the involvement of the contralesional cortex in the stroke recovery
process (6, 42, 43). It is also possible that the increases in neurotrophins are related to the contralesional limb movement
during M1 stimulation (Movie S1), as this movement can send
signals back to contralesional and ipsilesional cortices (44, 45).
BDNF, the most extensively studied neurotrophin, has been
shown to promote poststroke recovery and enhance axonal and
dendritic sprouting (10, 11), which are critical repair/plasticity
processes for recovery. The enhanced expression of neurotrophins such as BDNF in the contralesional cortex highlights
their importance in promoting recovery poststroke. However, it
is unclear whether the contralesional increases of neurotrophins
are solely responsible for the recovery effect of iM1 neuronal
stimulation. Further studies are needed to clarify their role.

(iM1, cM1, iS1, and cS1) are outlined in Fig. 4A. Stroke induced
a significant decrease of BDNF expression in iS1 of both stimulated and nonstimulated stroke mice compared with sham. Interestingly, stimulated stroke mice exhibited a significantly higher
level of BDNF in cM1 and cS1 than nonstimulated mice (Fig. 4B).
Western blot analysis indicated that BDNF protein levels were also
significantly higher in stimulated mice, specifically in iM1, cM1,
and iS1 (Fig. S2). NGF expression was also significantly up-regulated in cM1 of stimulated vs. nonstimulated mice, whereas stroke
alone caused a decrease in iM1 NGF (Fig. 4C). Similarly, neurotrophin 3 (NTF3) expression was also significantly elevated in cM1
and cS1 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, repeated neuronal stimulations in
normal nonstroke mice did not cause significant changes in levels
of any neurotrophins (Fig. S3).

Stroke induces a number of repair and rewiring processes that
promote axonal sprouting and reorganization (1–4). A number
of growth-related molecules such as GAP43, MARCKS, and
CAP23 have been associated with directing axonal sprouting and
remapping (3, 4, 40). In particular, GAP43 has been used as
a plasticity marker and its expression is strongly correlated with
poststroke axonal sprouting (3, 4, 40). GAP43 is enriched in
growth cones and its expression is up-regulated after stroke in
the peri-infarct areas (3, 40). Our stimulated mice exhibited
a significant increase of GAP43 expression in both iS1 and cM1
at poststroke day 15 (Fig. 5). These data suggest that poststroke
stimulations may enhance synaptic plasticity and reorganization.
Interestingly, the enhanced GAP43 expression in cM1 further
supports the involvement of the contralesional cortex in recovery. Future studies will fully investigate the effects of poststroke stimulations on other aspects of synaptic plasticity and
reorganization, such as axonal sprouting, dendritic branching,
and synaptogenesis.
Our data indicate that repeated iM1 neuronal stimulations can
restore the temporary depression of the ipsilesional neurovascular coupling response after stroke, with a significant improvement in CBF and neurovascular coupling in stimulated
mice at poststroke day 15 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). Using LDF, we
observed an increase in CBF during the laser-on period, consistent with the view that neuronal activity drives hemodynamic
signals. Recent evidence has shown that optogenetic stimulation
of cortical excitatory neurons increases blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals (46). Interestingly, we observed a larger
CBF increase after the laser was turned off, which has not been
previously reported. This larger CBF increase suggests that
stimulated stroke mice had a functional neurovascular coupling

system similar to sham mice; this effect was completely absent in
nonstimulated stroke mice (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). Moreover, our
repeated iM1 stimulation paradigm was able to promote functional recovery at poststroke day 14, with stimulated mice performing significantly better in the rotating beam test (Fig. 6 B
and C and Movies S2–S4). However, the relationship between
the enhanced neurovascular coupling response and recovery
needs to be further investigated. Future studies should also
address the effectiveness of the stimulation, such as examining
a longer poststroke period (i.e., up to 30 d) to determine if the
stimulation effect is transient or persistent.
Our studies demonstrate that stimulating only neurons is
sufficient to activate beneficial mechanisms that promote recovery. These specific neuronal stimulations can elicit movements in the affected forelimb and promote functional recovery,
possibly through multiple repair/plasticity-associated processes,
such as enhanced CBF/neurovascular coupling and increased
neurotrophin expression. Understanding the mechanisms driving
recovery will help identify potential drug targets for stroke
treatment. Our studies also provide to our knowledge the first
proof-of-principle use of optogenetics to promote recovery after
stroke. Whether optogenetic stimulation can be applied clinically
to stroke patients in the future remains to be determined and
would require using gene therapy techniques. However, a number of clinical studies are already using intracerebral gene therapy to treat several neurological disorders (47–49). The precision
and selectivity of optogenetics might provide an advantage to
other stimulation methods, possibly by offering similar or greater
therapeutic efficacy with fewer side effects.

successive 1-min stimulations daily separated by 3-min rest intervals. A 473nm blue laser (OEM Laser Systems) was controlled by the Agilent function
generator (AGT33210A) and mice were stimulated with the laser set to
10 Hz, 20 ms light pulses with a power range of 0.4–0.8 mW, measured by
a power meter (Thorlabs). We used the minimal laser power necessary to
elicit movements in the affected forelimb. Stimulations were performed in
the morning between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM and behavior tests were performed between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. Thus, each mouse had ∼4 h between
stimulation and behavior tests. The effectiveness of iM1 neuronal stimulation was evaluated by visual examination of contralesional forelimb movement during the stimulation period.

by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For stereotaxic surgery, mice were first anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and then
maintained on 2–3% isoflurane. Body temperature, heart rate, and respiration were monitored every 15 min and kept in physiological range. Mice
were anchored in a digital stereotaxic frame, an incision was made on the
top of the scalp, and a small hole was exposed using a drill. The fiber optic
cannula (200 μm) was stereotaxically implanted in the iM1 or cM1 using
coordinates obtained from the stereotaxic atlas (50) [iM1: anteroposterior
(AP) = +0.74 mm, mediolateral (ML) = −1.5 mm, and dorsoventral (DV) =
−0.5 mm; cM1: AP = +0.74 mm, ML = +1.5 mm, and DV = −0.5 mm], C&B
Metabond (Parkell), and dental cement was applied to secure the fiber optic
cannula to the skull. Wounds were closed with suturing and tissue glue, and
mice were administered an appropriate amount of buprenorphine and 0.9%
saline (s.c.). Mice were monitored for recovery and returned to home cages.
Continuous s.c. saline was given for 7 d poststroke to help prevent dehydration due to reduced mobility. Mice were randomized and experimenters were blinded. The stereotaxic implant surgery, stroke surgery,
and behavior tests were performed by three different individuals.
Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion. Mice were anesthetized with
5% isoflurane and then maintained on 2–3% isoflurane and physiological
parameters were kept as mentioned above. An intraluminal suture was
inserted into the left internal carotid artery to block the blood flow to the
middle cerebral artery. The suture was left in place for 30 min and removed
to allow reperfusion. Wounds were closed with suturing and tissue glue, and
mice were administered an appropriate amount of buprenorphine and 0.9%
saline (s.c.). Mice were monitored for recovery and returned to home cages.
Stimulation Paradigm. All five mice groups (normal + no stim, normal + stim,
sham, stroke + no stim, and stroke + stim) underwent identical handling and
behavior procedures with the exception of stimulated mice that received
laser pulses (Fig. 2). The difference between normal and sham mice was that
sham mice underwent mock stroke procedure, which included anesthesia
and skin incision on the chest. Each stimulated mouse received three

Cerebral Blood Flow Measurements. Changes in CBF were measured using LDF
(PF5001; Perimed). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted on
a stereotaxic frame. The fiber optic cannula and dental cement were carefully
removed without damaging the skull. A small hole was opened on the iM1
and cM1 using a dental drill, and a fiber optic cannula was inserted at a depth
of 0.5 mm. A LDF probe was placed adjacent to the fiber optic cannula where
the skull is intact (Fig. 3). Once the readings were stable, a 1-min baseline was
collected, followed by 1-min laser pulses (10 Hz 20 ms at 0.5 mW) with recording for another 3 min. After measurements were completed, mice were
sacrificed and brains were removed for infarct analysis.
RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR. At poststroke day 15, mice were sacrificed and perfused with cold sterile 1× PBS and brain regions (iM1, cM1, iS1,
and cS1) were dissected on ice with 1× PBS. Dissected regions were kept on
ice in RNAlater and frozen at −80 °C. RNA was extracted with the Qiagen
RNeasy Plus kit. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript
Reverse Transcriptase II with oligo dT12-18 primer (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). qPCR reaction mixtures were prepared using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies;
4369016) and Taqman primers (Life Technologies) targeting mouse BDNF
(Mm04230607_s1), NGF (Mm00443039_m1), NTF3 (Mm00435413_s1), VEGF
(Mm01281449_m1), and GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1). qPCR data were analyzed
using the Delta Delta CT method.
Behavior Tests. We used the rotating beam test to evaluate motor and sensory
function on day 0, and poststroke days 2, 7, 10, and 14. The behavior tests
were performed by a blinded observer. Three trials were performed and the
two closest values were averaged. Mice were handled and pretrained three
times before the preimplant baseline. Two baselines were collected: (i)
preimplant baseline was collected the day before implant; (ii) prestroke
baseline was collected the day before stroke. Prestroke baseline was used as
our day 0 data. Exclusion criteria was as follows: Mice that exhibited behavioral deficit after implant surgery were excluded. Mice that did not exhibit behavioral deficit and body weight loss on poststroke day 2 were
excluded. Histology with silver staining allowed visualization of the infarct,
and mice with striatal-only infarcts were excluded from the study.
Rotating beam test was as follows: This motor/sensory test measures the
distance traveled and the speed of mice placed on a rotating white fiberglass
beam (length 120 cm, diameter 13 mm, distances marked in centimeters). The
beam, attached to a motor that rotates at 3 rpm, is located 60 cm above a
table covered with bubble cushions to reduce the mouse’s impact from a fall.

effect on distance traveled (D) or speed (E) in normal mice. n = 6 per group.

In Vivo Optrode Recording. Optrode recording was performed in isofluraneanesthetized mice on a stereotaxic frame (KOPF), and recording was carried
out as described previously (51). Recordings were performed on stroke mice
at poststroke day 5. Briefly, a 500-μm tungsten electrode was bonded to
a 200-μm optical fiber ∼0.5–0.7 mm in front of the fiber face to create an
optrode. This optrode was installed on one arm of the stereotaxic inserted in
iM1 (AP = +0.74 mm, ML = −1.5 mm, DV = −0.5 mm) and used to deliver
473-nm laser pulses at 0.5 mW (10 Hz, 20 ms). Electrophysiological recordings
were digitized and then recorded with pCLAMP (Axon). For dual recordings
of iM1, iS1, iStr, or cM1, a second recording electrode was used on a separate
stereotaxic arm. After obtaining reliable firing in M1, the second electrode
was inserted into the follow regions using the coordinates obtained from the
stereotaxic atlas (50): iS1 (AP = +0.74 mm, ML = −3.25 mm, DV = −0.5 mm),
iStr (AP = +0.74 mm, ML = −2.6 mm, DV = −2.5 mm) or cM1 (AP = +0.74 mm,
ML = +1.5 mm, DV = −0.5 mm), and simultaneous optrode and electrode
traces were recorded. After the traces were collected, the recording sites were
cauterized with a current generator (10 μÅ) attached to the electrode for post
hoc electrode localization. Mice were sacrificed and brains were removed,
sectioned, and mounted onto slides. Infarct was visualized with cresyl violet
and compared with the electrode recording position.

Statistical Tests. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used for
CBF studies. One-way ANOVA with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD)
was used in qPCR studies in stroke mice. Student t test was used for qPCR
studies in normal mice and in Western blot studies. Two-way ANOVA repeated measures with Fisher’s LSD was used for the behavior and body
weight studies.

protein extractions and western blots.
