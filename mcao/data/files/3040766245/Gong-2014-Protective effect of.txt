Abstract
Aim: Glycyrrhizin (GL) has been reported to protect against ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury by inhibiting the
cytokine activity of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). In the present study, the protective effects of GL against I/R injury,
as well as the related molecular mechanisms, were investigated in rat brains.
Methods: Focal cerebral I/R injury was induced by intraluminal filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in
Male Sprague-Dawley rats. GL alone or GL and rHMGB1 were administered intravenously at the time of reperfusion. Serum
levels of HMGB1 and inflammatory mediators were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Histopathological examination, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to investigate
the protective and anti-apoptotic effects and related molecular mechanisms of GL against I/R injury in rat brains.
Results: Pre-treatment with GL significantly reduced infarct volume and improved the accompanying neurological deficits
in locomotor function. The release of HMGB1 from the cerebral cortex into the serum was inhibited by GL administration.
Moreover, pre-treatment with GL alleviated apoptotic injury resulting from cerebral I/R through the inhibition of
cytochrome C release and caspase 3 activity. The expression levels of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related molecules
including TNF-a, iNOS, IL-1b, and IL-6, which were over-expressed in I/R, were decreased by GL. P38 and P-JNK signalling
were involved in this process. All of the protective effects of GL could be reversed by rHMGB1 administration.
Conclusions: GL has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brains through the inhibition of inflammation,
oxidative stress and apoptotic injury by antagonising the cytokine activity of HMGB1.

signalling pathways that may either contribute to neuronal
damage or protect neurons. Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) have crucial roles in signal transduction from the cell
surface to the nucleus and regulate cell death and survival
processes. Among the MAPK pathways known to be activated in
neurons in response to ischemia are the JNK, ERK, and p38
MAPK pathways [4,5].
High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous and
abundant nuclear protein, can either be passively released into
the extracellular milieu in response to necrotic signals or actively
secreted in response to inflammatory signals [6–8]. Recently,
HMGB1 has been reported to be a potent pro-inflammatory
cytokine-like factor that contributes to the pathogenesis of
vasculature and connects excitotoxicity-induced acute damage

Introduction
Ischemic stroke remains one of the leading cause of death and
disability worldwide. Recent insight into the basic mechanism
involved in ischemic stroke indicates that endothelial dysfunctions
along with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation represent key
elements in the occurrence and development of ischemic brain
damage that results in cell damage and death [1,2]. Within hours
of the ischemic insult, infiltrating leukocytes, as well as resident
brain cells including neurons and glia, may release pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and oxygen/
nitrogen free radicals that contribute to the evolution of tissue
damage [3]. Furthermore, the cerebral ischemia that occurs in
brain cells affected by a stroke triggers a complex array of
molecular and cellular alterations including the activation of

60 min, according to methods that have been described previously
[23]. After 60 min of MCA occlusion, reperfusion of the MCA was
initiated by removing the MCA-occlusive filament. The right
femoral artery was cannulated to monitor mean arterial blood
pressure, arterial blood gases, and pH. Regional cerebral blood
flow was monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter (Periflux
System 5000; Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden). A thermoregulated
heating pad and an overhead heating lamp were used to maintain
a rectal temperature of 3760.5uC. In sham-operated rats, an
incision was made over the MCA, but the artery was not occluded.
The cerebral I/R injury model was developed with 60 min of
MCA occlusion followed by 48 h reperfusion.

processes with delayed inflammatory processes in the postischemic brain [9,10]. The receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE), one of the most important receptors for
HMGB1, functions as a sensor of necrotic cell death, and the
HMGB1–RAGE signalling axis contributes to inflammation and
ischemic brain damage [11]. Intravenous injection of neutralising
anti-HMGB1 mAb or intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA
conferred robust neuroprotection in the post-ischemic brain by
antagonising the pro-inflammatory function of HMGB1 [12,13].
Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a major active constituent of Glycyrrhiza
glabra root and is composed of a molecule of glycyrrhizic acid and
two molecules of glucuronic acid. This compound has been
associated with numerous pharmacological effects, including antiinflammatory, anti-viral, anti-tumour, and hepatoprotective activities, and is commonly used in Asia to treat patients with chronic
hepatitis [14–17]. It was reported by Sitia et al [18] that, as an
HMGB1 inhibitor, GL binds directly to HMGB1 (Kd ,150 mM),
interacting with two shallow concave surfaces formed by the two
arms of both HMG boxes. GL has been reported to protect from
I/R-induced injury in many organs, including the liver [19], spinal
cord [20] and heart [21], by inhibiting the chemoattractant and
mitogenic functions of HMGB1. Recently, a robust neuroprotective effect of Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), a GLcontaining preparation, has been reported in the post-ischemic
brain, and this neuroprotective effect is due, at least in part, to an
anti-inflammatory effect [22]. However, it is not known if the
neuroprotective effect of GL occurs through the antagonism of
HMGB1 and the ensuing molecular signalling events. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective
effect of GL, as well as the related mechanisms, against I/R injury
in the rat brain, mainly in relation to the following aspects: (1) the
neuroprotective effects of GL on focal cerebral ischemia; (2) the
release of HMGB1 in rat serum and brain; (3) the effect of GL on
the alleviation of apoptosis caused by I/R injury; (4) the expression
of HMGB1-dependent inflammation- and oxidative stress-related
molecules; (5) the involvement of certain MAPK pathways that are
modulated by GL.

Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and infarct
volume assessments
Coronal brain sections (2-mm thickness) were incubated with
2% TTC at 37uC for 30 min with gentle shaking and then fixed
with 10% formalin in PBS. The stained slices were photographed,
and the size of the infarct was quantified using NIH image
software.
TTC staining was used to measure infarction volumes two days
after I/R (n = 8 per group) and whole brains were dissected
coronally into 2-mm brain slices. Two investigators blinded to the
study protocol measured the infarct sizes with a computerised
image analyser. To account for cerebral oedema and differential
shrinkage resulting from tissue processing, the areas of ischemic
lesions were determined by subtracting the areas in ipsilateral
hemispheres from those of contralateral hemispheres. Infarct
volumes were calculated (in mm3) by multiplying the summed
section infarct areas by the section thickness.

Evaluation of neurological deficits
Neurological deficits were evaluated by two methods. In the
rota-rod test, rats were conditioned for 3 days before MCA
occlusion on an accelerating rota-rod cylinder at 5 to 15 rpm. Rats
that could stay on the rotating rod at 15 rpm for 180 s were
subjected to MCA occlusion. After MCA occlusion, each rat was
subjected to trials conducted at 3 different speeds (5, 10 and
15 rpm), and the mean duration of three trials at each speed on
the rota-rod was recorded. The other test was a neurological
scoring method, which was performed essentially as described by
Bederson et al [24]. The scores were categorised according to four
grades (0, normal; 1, moderate; 2, considerable; 3, severe). The
modified Neurological Severity Scores system consists of motor,
sensory, balance, and reflex tests, all of which are graded using a
scale of 0–18 (normal: 0, maximal deficit: 18). The neurological
evaluation was performed by an investigator who was blind to the
treatment condition.

Materials and Methods
Animals and groups
All experiments were performed in accordance with the ‘‘Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’’ published by the US
NIH (National Institutes of Health Publication No. 85-23, revised
1996) and were approved by the Committee on Animal
Experiments of the Sichuan Neurosurgical Institute. Male
Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 325625 g were obtained from
the Experimental Animal Centre of the Sichuan Neurosurgical
Institute (China) and were allowed free access to laboratory chow
and tap water in day-night quarters at 25uC. Rats were randomly
divided into the following four experimental groups of 8 animals
each: (1) healthy control, sham-operated rats (the sham group); (2)
I/R rats pre-treated with saline (the NS group); (3,4,5) I/R rats
pre-treated with GL separately at doses of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and
10 mg/kg (the 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg GL groups); (6)
I/R rats pre-treated with GL and recombinant HMGB1 (100 mg
per rat) (the GL+rHMGB1 group). In the pre-treatment groups,
after 30 min ischemia and before reperfusion, NS, GL or GL plus
rHMGB1 was administered intravenously in the tail vein in a
volume of 0.5 ml followed by a 48 h reperfusion.

Serum ELISA detection
Blood samples (0.5 ml) were collected from the femoral vein at
6, 12, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. Serum was isolated from the
blood after centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 20 min at 4uC. After
centrifugation, serum was frozen at 280uC until enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses were performed. HMGB1
concentrations and the levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-a,
iNOS,IL-1b, COX-2 and IL-6) in the serum samples were
quantified using specific ELISA kits for rats according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Biosource International Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA).

Analysis of superoxide and peroxynitrite formation

Total protein extracts or detached subcellular fractions from rat
cerebral tissue were prepared as described previously [25]. The
antibodies and the dilutions were as follows: p-JNK No. 9255
(1:2000), t-JNK No. 9252 (1:1000), p-ERK [1/2] No. 9101
(1:1000),
t-ERK
[1/2]
No. 4695
(1:1000),
p-p38
No. 9211(1:1000), t-p38 No. 9212 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass), Cytochrome c (1 mg/ml, No. ab90529,
Abcam Plc., Cambridge, UK) and HMGB1 (1 mg/ml,
No. ab18256, Abcam Plc., Cambridge, UK). Horseradish peroxidase–coupled rabbit and mouse IgG (1:2000) were used as
secondary antibodies. Proteins were separated on 10–20% SDS
polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then incubated
overnight at 4uC with the primary antibody diluted in blocking
solution. After washing, membranes were treated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and then with
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). The film was scanned with a GS-700 imaging
densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and the
results were quantified with Multi-Analyst software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories).

The oxidative fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE; SigmaAldrich) was used to evaluate in situ superoxide production [27].
Frozen, enzymatically intact brains from the ischemic core region
were cut into 30-mm thick sections and placed on glass slides. The
sections were simultaneously incubated with DHE (10 mmol/L) in
phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37uC, in a humidified
chamber that was shielded from light. We also monitored
peroxynitrite formation by detecting nitrosylated tyrosine residues
on proteins. We performed immunostaining with an anti-3nitrotyrosine (3-NT) antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology).
Coronal sections cut through the striatum (3 sections per brain,
1 mm in width) were imaged in parallel. Superoxide or 3-NT–
positive cells were manually counted in the eight regions around
the striatum under 6100 magnification using a laser scanning
confocal microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 (argon
and krypton).

Measurement of lipid peroxidation
Malondialdehyde (MDA) was estimated as an indicator of lipid
peroxidation (n = 8 per group). Brain tissues were homogenised
with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reagents (1.5 ml
acetic acid, 1.5 ml thiobarbituric acid, and 0.2 ml sodium dodecyl
sulphate) were added to 0.1 ml of processed tissue sample. The
mixture was then heated at 100uC for 60 min. The mixture was
cooled with tap water and 5 ml of n-butanol:pyridine (15:1), and
1 ml of distilled water was added. After centrifugation at
4000 rpm for 10 min, the organic layer was withdrawn and the
absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer.

RNA preparation and reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and 1 mg RNA samples were used for cDNA synthesis. First-strand
cDNA synthesis was primed with random hexamers and
conducted according to the manufacturer’s specifications (RTPCR kit; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA equivalent to
200 ng of total RNA was subjected to PCR using the manufacturer’s protocol (PCR core kit; Roche). The sense and antisense
primers used for the analysis of rat HMGB1, TNF-a, IL-1b,
iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 and GAPDH expression were as follows.
HMGB1: 59-CTGATGCAGCTTA TACGAAG-39 and 59TCAGGTAAGGAGCAGAACAT- 39 (460 bp). TNF-a: 59-CCC CTTTATCGTCTACTCCTC-39 and 59-GCTGGTAGTTTAGCTCCGTTT-39 (553 bp). IL-1b: 59-TCATTGTGGCTGTGGAGAAG-39 and 59-CTATGTCCCGACCATTGCTG-39
(579 bp). iNOS: 59-GCATCCCAAGTACGAGTGGT-39 and
59-GAAGGCGTAG CTGAACAAGG-39 (700 bp). COX-2: 59GTGGGATGACGAGCGACTGT-39 and 59 -TTTCAGGGAGAAGCGTTTGC-39 (454 bp). IL-6: 59-GGATACCACCCACAACAGAC-39 and 59-TTGCCGAGTAGACCTCATAG-39
(520 bp). GAPDH: 59-CCATCAC TGCCACTCAGAAGA-39
and 59-CATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGT- 39 (446 bp). The
annealing temperature was 55uC for all primer pairs.

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the means6SEM (standard error of
the mean). SPSS 17.0 was used for statistical analysis of the data.
The concentrations of serum HMGB1 and inflammatory mediators were analysed using two-way repeated measures (time and
group) analysis of variance followed by the post hoc StudentNewman-Keuls test. The significance level was set at p,0.05.

Results
Neuroprotective effects of GL on focal cerebral ischemia
No damage was observed upon TTC staining in the cerebrums
of sham-group rats, whereas MCA occlusion for 60 min in rats
produced massive infarction 48 h after reperfusion. Pre-treatment
with different concentrations of GL significantly reduced the
infarct volumes in a dose-dependent manner in focal cerebral I/R
rats. There were no significant differences between the infarct
volumes of the 4 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg GL-pre-treatment groups.
Hence, a dose of 4 mg/kg of GL was selected for subsequent
experiments, considering the potential for drug toxicity (Figure 1A).
High Neurological Severity Scores in the NS rats persisted for
up to 48 h. Consistent with the reduced infarct volumes, when
4 mg/kg GL was administered at 30 min after ischemia and
before reperfusion, the mean modified Neurological Severity
Scores were significantly lower than those of rats in the PBStreated NS group from 6 h to 48 h. From 6 h to 24 h, the
Neurological Severity Scores declined slowly and reached the
minimum value at 48 h after reperfusion in the GL group
(Figure 1B). Motor activities were assessed using the rota-rod test
at 5, 10 or 15 rpm speed loads. Pre-treatment with 4 mg/kg GL
markedly improved the neurological deficits observed on the rotarod test from 6 h to 48 h, regardless of whether the 5, 10 or
15 rpm speed load was used (Figure 1C). These results showed
that pre-treatment with GL had neuroprotective effects on the

Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining
Brains were isolated and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde by
transcardial perfusion and post-fixed in the same solution
overnight at 4uC. Coronal brain sections (20 mm) from the
ischemic core region were prepared using a vibratome (Leica,
Solms, Germany), and immunological staining was performed
using a previously described floating method [26]. Rabbit antiHMGB1 (ab18956; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibody was used
at a 1:500 dilution. FITC-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as a
secondary antibody for anti-HMGB1.
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay was carried out with a
commercial TUNEL kit (Roche, Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Apoptotic cells in the rat heart after I/
R in each group were counted separately using Image J software.

Immunofluorescence staining of nuclear HMGB1 was observed
in the cerebral cortex in rats from the sham group (Figure 2D).
However, the staining almost disappeared in the core of the infarct
in the NS group 48 h after reperfusion, and markedly increased
HMGB1 staining was observed in the extracellular space. The
number of nuclear HMGB1-positive cells significantly increased
upon pre-treatment with 4 mg/kg GL, and this was accompanied
by a decrease in extracellular HMGB1 staining. These data
suggested that increased serum levels of HMGB1 are probably
attributable to spill-over from necrotic neural cells during cerebral
ischemia and that GL may have a protective effect against
MCAO/reperfusion-mediated cell death in neural cells, thereby
decreasing the amount of HMGB1 released from the cerebral
cortex into the serum.

post-ischemic brain, which were manifested as improvements in
motor impairments and neurological deficits scores.

Inhibition of HMGB1 release by GL in rats that underwent
MCAO
We observed that plasma HMGB1 levels rapidly increased
starting 6 h after MCAO for 1 h, peaked at 24 h after reperfusion,
and then declined slowly (Figure 2A–B). When rats were pretreated with 4 mg/kg GL, the plasma HMGB1 level was
significantly decreased compared with that observed in the NS
group at any time during the experimental procedure (Figure 2A–
B). At 12 h after MCA occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion, brain
HMGB1 levels in the infarct area declined significantly to below
the basal level and reached a minimum value at 24 h after
MCAO/reperfusion. Moreover, at each time point from 12 h to
48 h after MCAO/reperfusion, brain HMGB1 levels after
treatment with GL were significantly higher than those observed
in the NS group (Figure 2C).

GL inhibits HMGB1-dependent apoptotic injury

brain I/R injury occurs via antagonism of HMGB1 function, we
determined the infarct volumes of rat brains under conditions in

which rHMGB1 was included. As shown in Figure 3A, although
the infarct volume was significantly decreased in the 4 mg/kg GL
group compared with the NS group, co-treatment with 4 mg/kg
GL and 100 mg rHMGB1 30 min before ischemia significantly
alleviated these changes, resulting in infarct volumes similar those
observed in the NS group.
Next, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effect of
GL can alleviate I/R-induced, HMGB1-dependent apoptosis and
whether cytochrome C and caspase 3, the two most important
players, are involved in this process. As depicted in Figure 3B, a
large number of TUNEL-positive cells was observed in the right
cortex of rats subjected to I/R injury, whereas TUNEL positive
cells were not detected in the right cortex of sham-operated rats.
Upon pre-treatment with 4 mg/kg GL, the number of TUNELpositive cells was significantly reduced in the right cortex
compared with the NS group. Moreover, co-treatment with
rHMGB1 increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, as
expected.
In the sham group, under basal conditions, cytochrome C was
predominantly expressed in the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 3C).
The NS group exhibited a significant decrease in cytochrome C
expression in the mitochondrial fraction when compared with the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

sham group, whereas an increase was observed in the cytosolic
fraction. Pre-treatment with GL resulted in a significant increase
in cytochrome C expression in the mitochondrial fraction and a
decrease in the cytosolic fraction compared with the NS group.
However, expression still did not reach the level observed in the
sham group. Moreover, co-treatment with rHMGB1 can partly
abolish the effect of GL on the subcellular distribution of
cytochrome C proteins between the cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions. There was no significant difference in the total
expression of cytochrome C protein between each group
(Figure 3C). As an executioner caspase, the change in caspase 3
activity was similar to that observed with cytochrome C expression
in the cytosolic fraction (Figure 3D). These results demonstrate
that the administration of GL significantly alleviates the cerebral
cell apoptotic injury caused by I/R through the antagonism of
HMGB1 function and that the mechanism involved regulation of
cytochrome C release and caspase 3 activation.

expression and oxidative stress

showed in Figure 4A, MCA occlusion/reperfusion significantly upregulated the expression of TNF-a, iNOS, IL-1b, COX-2 and IL6 in the cerebral cortex compared with the non-ischemic side in
the sham group. Treatment with GL significantly inhibited the
expression of TNF-a, iNOS, IL-1b and IL-6 but had no apparent
effect on the expression of COX-2. In contrast, co-treatment with
rHMGB1 and GL again enhanced the expression of TNF-a,
iNOS, IL-1b and IL-6 compared with the GL-pre-treatment alone
group (P,0.01). The serum concentrations of TNF-a, iNOS, IL1b and IL-6 in each group showed a similar trend to that of the
mRNA expression levels, as determined by ELISA (Figure 4B).
These results indicated that GL can inhibit the I/R-induced
expression of HMGB1-dependent inflammation- and oxidative
stress-related molecules in rat brains.
In the sham group, little DHE-induced EtBr fluorescence or 3NT immunoreactivity was observed. The relative fluorescence
intensities of superoxide-generating cells and 3-NT–positive cells
were significantly increased in the NS-treated I/R hemisphere
(Figure 5A–B). When rats were pre-treated with 4 mg/kg GL, the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

fluorescence intensity caused by superoxide and 3-NT production
was significantly reduced compared with the NS group. In
contrast, co-treatment with 4 mg/kg GL and 100 mg rHMGB1
enhanced the fluorescence intensity of superoxide and 3-NT
production compared with the GL group, though the intensity was
still lower than that in the NS group (Figure 5A–B). These
histological results were further supported by a biochemical assay
for MDA, a lipid peroxidation product. Pre-treatment with 4 mg/
kg GL significantly decreased the level of MDA, compared with
the NS group, while co-treatment with 100 mg rHMGB1 again
increased the level of MDA, though this was still lower than that in
the NS group (Figure 5C).

GL modulates P38 and P-JNK but not p-ERK signalling
The mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway is tightly
regulated by the mitogen_activated protein (MAP) kinase family,
and among these, JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 have been demonstrated to be activated during I/R injury [28,29]. To study
whether GL can modulate MAP kinase activity, we analysed these

The use of a medium concentration of 4 mg/kg yielded
considerable improvements, similar to those found at the high
concentration of 10 mg/kg GL. Furthermore, this neuroprotective
effect was accompanied by a reduction in the release of HMGB1
into the extracellular space and in the related inflammatory factors
TNF-a, iNOS, IL-1b, and IL-6, both in the brain and serum of
rats (Figure 2 and 4). Using this dose, no significant toxicities were
observed in the effects investigated, including changes in the
baseline hemodynamic values, cardiac electrophysiology, and in
histopathological analysis of vital organs including liver, spleen,
lung, kidney, and brain (data not shown).
HMGB1 is a nonhistone DNA-binding protein that possesses
two HMG boxes that are DNA binding domains [30]. As a
chromosomal protein, it has been implicated in diverse intracellular functions including stabilising nucleosomal structure and
facilitating of gene transcription [31]. Moreover, HMGB1 is
massively released extracellularly and plays a cytokine-like
function in the post-ischemic brain [26,32]. HMGB1 is actively
secreted by macrophages and monocytes or released by necrotic
cells into the extracellular milieu, where it might be involved in
triggering inflammation [33–36]. The present study demonstrated
that the predominantly nuclear HMGB1 staining of neurons in
rats from the sham group weakened and disappeared during

MAP kinases by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 6, I/R
induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in isolated rat
brain cerebral cortex. In GL-pre-treated rats, the phosphorylation
levels of p38 and p-JNK were decreased compared with the NStreated group, whereas p-ERK1/2 was not affected. Co-treatment
with rHMGB1 enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK
compared with the GL group, but the levels were still lower than
those observed in the NS group. Pre-treatment with GL alone or
with rHMGB1 did not affect the total levels of the JNK, ERK1/2,
and p38 proteins. These results demonstrated that GL can
modulate the p38 and JNK signalling pathways, but not the ERK
signalling pathway, in the brains of MCA-occluded rats and that
this effect is HMGB1 dependent.

Discussion
Traditional Chinese medicine has become increasingly important in the treatment of cardiovascular ischemia/reperfusion
injury. GL is a natural anti-inflammatory compound that is
commonly used in Japan to treat patients with chronic hepatitis
[14–17]. In the present study, we demonstrated that intravenous
pre-treatment with a wide range of concentrations of GL, from
2 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, reduced cerebral infarct volumes and
ameliorated the neurological deficits of rat cerebral I/R injury.

present time, but we speculate that GL may modulate the activity
of a particular kinase that contributes to cytochrome c translocation and is involved in I/R-induced HMGB1-dependent apoptosis.
Apoptosis is tightly regulated by the mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinase family, and the JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 members of
this family have been demonstrated to be activated in I/R injury.
MAPKs play important roles in transducing signals by phosphorylating intracellular enzymes, transcription factors and cytosolic
proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine production. Sustained MAPK activation has been shown to be associated
with neuronal cell death/apoptosis following ischemic stroke, and
the inhibition of this pathway is neuroprotective. In a Huh-BAT
cell model, GL prevented HMGB1_induced cytochrome c release
and p38 activation but had no effect on phospho_JNK and
ERK1/2 [42]. In I/R-induced myocardial injury of rat heart,
treatment with HMGB1 box A significantly reduced ERK1/2 and
JNK phosphorylation, but did not affect the level of phospho-p38
[43]. However, in another similar study, treatment with GL
significantly decreased JNK phosphorylation, but did not affect the
level of phospho-p38 and ERK1/221. Interestingly, in our studies,
GL could modulate the p38 and JNK signalling pathways, but did
not affect the ERK signalling pathway in the brains of MCAoccluded rats, and rHMGB1 could reverse this effect (Figure 6).
This ambiguity regarding which single class of MAPK can be
modulated by GL appears to primarily depend on the cell and
tissue types used and differences in MAPK levels in vivo and in
vitro.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that pre-treatment with
GL blocked and inhibited the extracellular cytokine activity of
HMGB1 and explored the protective effect on I/R-induced
apoptosis through the blockage of the JNK and p38-mediated
pathways in rats in vivo. These data suggest a new therapeutic
possibility for the treatment of ischemic stroke with GL.
Considering the biological differences between species that may
influence drug adsorption, metabolism, distribution, and toxicity
in rats and humans, it is not clear whether GL has similar
protective effects in humans. Hence, future research should be
performed to evaluate the beneficial protective effect of GL in

cerebral ischemia (Figure 2D). Thus, release from necrotic neural
cells is the most likely source of elevated HMGB1 concentrations
in the serum, which were further determined by immunoblot
analysis in rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. A recent
report of elevated serum concentrations of HMGB1 in stroke
patients confirmed our findings [37]. Antagonising the proinflammatory function or blocking the expression of HMGB1 by
a neutralising antibody [11,12], HMGB1 box A [11], or a short
hairpin RNA [10,13] ameliorated brain damage. In particular, the
expression of TNF-a, iNOS and IL-1b, which were all upregulated in the post-ischemic brain, was reduced when HMGB1
was inhibited [10,11], consistent with our results. HMGB1 has
been reported to stimulate the production of IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6,
and IL-8 and to induce iNOS expression [38,39]. In the present
study, we demonstrated that the ischemia-induced up-regulation
of iNOS, IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a was inhibited by treatment with
GL. Co-treatment with rHMGB1 can partially reverse this effect
(Figure 4). The induction of iNOS and TNF-a following an
ischemic insult was reported to occur mainly in microglia. Thus, it
is likely that HMGB1 activates microglia in the brain, leading to
the up-regulation of iNOS and TNF-a expression. In fact, the
induction of iNOS and TNF-a has been reported to be involved in
the inflammatory response and the disruption of the blood-brain
barrier, leading to the aggravation of brain infarction [40,41]. The
regulation of any one of these factors has been postulated to
reduce ischemic injury. Therefore, it is reasonable that GL, which
has the ability to substantially reduce the expression of proinflammatory factors, exerted profound therapeutic effects on
brain infarction.
In this study, pre-treatment with GL alleviated apoptosis injury
resulting from cerebral I/R, and this was at least partly due to the
inhibition of cytochrome C release and caspase 3 activity.
Similarly, GL exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect by preventing
HMGB1-induced cytochrome C release and caspase 3 activation
in vitro in Huh-BAT cells [42]. Though the anti-apoptotic effect of
GL has been linked with HMGB1 inhibition and caspasedependent cytochrome c release, the question remains how GL
regulates caspase-dependent cytochrome c release through the
inhibition of HMGB1. The exact answer is not known at the

therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.
