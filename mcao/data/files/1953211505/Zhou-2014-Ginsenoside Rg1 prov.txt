Ginsenoside Rg1 is regarded as one of main bioactive compounds responsible for pharmaceutical actions
of ginseng with little toxicity and has been shown to have possibly neuroprotective effects. However,
the mechanism of its neuroprotection for acute ischemic stroke is still elusive. The purpose of present
study is thus to assess the neuroprotective effects of the ginsenoside Rg1 against blood brain barrier
disruption and neurological injury in a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, and then to explore
the mechanisms for these neuroprotective effects by targeting aquaporin 4. Focal cerebral ischemia was
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological examinations were performed by using Longa’s
5-point scale. Evans blue dye was used to investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on blood brain barrier
permeability. Immunohistochemical analysis and real-time ﬂuorescence quantitative polymerase chain
reaction were used to assess aquaporin 4 expression. As a result, general linear model with repeated
measures analysis of variance for neurological scores at 5 repeated measures showed that ginsenoside
Rg1-treated group could signiﬁcantly reduce the changing trend of neurological deﬁcit scores when
compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion model group (p < 0.05). Compared with the middle
cerebral artery occlusion model group, ginsenoside Rg1 group has signiﬁcantly decreased Evans blue
content and reduced aquaporin 4 expression at each time point (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ginsenoside Rg1
as a ginsenoside neuroprotective agent could improve neurological injury, attenuate blood brain barrier
disruption and downregulate aquaporin 4 expression induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion insults
in rats.

Introduction
Despite stroke declined from the third to the fourth leading
cause of death in the United States after heart disease, cancer,
and chronic lower respiratory diseases in 2008 (Towﬁghi and
Saver 2011), stroke is still one of leading causes of death worldwide and the ﬁrst cause of acquired disability, and its costs both
direct and indirect are astronomic (Strong et al. 2007). Ischemic
stroke refers to focal brain infarction that produces sudden neurologic deﬁcits persisting for longer than 1 h and accounts for

80–85% of all strokes (Zheng et al. 2010). However, up to now
treatment has been largely restricted to supportive and rehabilitative care except intravenous administration of recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Intravenous rt-PA remains the only
Food and Drug Administration approved pharmacological therapy
for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke, but intravenous rt-PA is recommended for selected patients only up to
4.5 h after stroke onset (Jauch et al. 2013). Furthermore, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is a devastating complication of
intravenous thrombolysis treatment that is associated with high
mortality (Seet and Rabinstein 2012). Another specialized care for
stroke is neuroprotective agents. Neuroprotection refers to the concept of applying a therapy that directly affects the brain tissue to
salvage or delay the infarction of the still-viable ischemic penumbra, rather than reperfusing the tissue (Jauch et al. 2013). Thus,
neuroprotection could reduce the ischemic impairment and the
overall costs that are accompanied in patients with severe disability. Pharmacological neuroprotection agents that limit the cellular
effects of acute ischemia or reperfusion may limit neurological

(Papadopoulos et al. 2004). However, the role of AQP4 in ischemic
edema is still in contrary.
In the present study, we assessed the neuroprotective effects
of the Rg1 against blood brain barrier disruption and neurological
injury in a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Furthermore,
the mechanisms for these neuroprotective effects were explored by
targeting AQP4.

Materials and methods
injury after ischemic stroke (Jauch et al. 2013). There has been a
recent explosion of interest in neuroprotection for ischemic stroke,
with over 1000 experimental papers and over 400 clinical articles appearing from 2001 to 2007 (Ginsberg 2008), but at present
no pharmacological agents with putative neuroprotective actions
have demonstrated efﬁcacy in improving outcomes after ischemic
stroke (Jauch et al. 2013). Therefore, many researchers resort to
naturally occurring compound as an potentially neuroprotective
agent.
Radix Ginseng, the root and rhizome of Panax ginseng C. A.
Meyer, has been used as a representative tonic remedy in China
and elsewhere for over 2000 years (Nah et al. 2007), and now is
still one of the most commonly used healing herbs for stroke and
chronic debilitating conditions (Zheng et al. 2011). The main pharmacologically active ingredients of ginseng are ginsenosides, being
responsible for most of the activities of ginseng (Lu et al. 2009). Over
30 ginsenosides have been identiﬁed and classiﬁed into two categories as follows: (1) the 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD-type: Rb1,
Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Rg3, Rh2, Rs1) and (2) the 20(S)-protopanaxatriol
(PPT-type: Re, Rf, Rg1, Rg2, Rh1) (Leung and Wong 2010). Ginsenoside Rg1, which chemically belongs to the PPT ginsenoside group
(Fig. 1), is regarded as one of main bioactive compounds responsible for pharmaceutical actions of ginseng with little toxicity and
has been shown to have possibly neuroprotective effects (Jiang et al.
2012). In recent years, many beneﬁcial effects of Rg1 on the nervous
and vascular systems have been reported as a potentially neuroprotective agent (Nah et al. 2007). However, the mechanisms of its
neuroprotective effects for ischemic stroke are still elusive.
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important regulator of brain
homeostasis, and its disturbance has been implicated in the onset
and/or evolution of many pathological manifestations of stroke
(Borlongan et al. 2012). Thus, BBB is thought as a central target
for abetting neuroprotection and neurorestoration in stroke. The
BBB is mainly composed of four cellular elements: endothelial cells,
astrocyte end-feet, microglial cells, and pericytes. A breakdown in
any of its individual components may contribute to BBB dysfunction (Sandoval and Witt 2008). BBB impairment is a well-known
marker of secondary cerebral injury following acute stroke associated with an increase in vascular permeability and brain edema,
exacerbating the initial ischemic injury (Latour et al. 2004). The
breakdown of the BBB during ischemic stroke constitutes the main
cause of early death after a stroke, but the molecular mechanisms
involved in these processes remain speculative.
Aside from its function in water homeostasis, recent studies showed possible interrelations between Aquaporin-4 (AQP4)
and BBB dysfunction followed by cerebral edema (Saadoun and
Papadopoulos 2010). AQP4 is a water-channel protein expressed
strongly in the mammalian brain, abundantly in astrocyte foot
processes at the borders between the brain parenchyma and
major ﬂuid compartments, including cerebrospinal ﬂuid and blood
(Papadopoulos and Verkman 2007). The role of AQP4 has been
explored in ischemic stroke where it participates in the formation
of cerebral edema (Ribeiro Mde et al. 2006). Simultaneously, AQP4
facilitated the clearance of vasogenic cerebral edema in pathologies where edema ﬂuid accumulates in the extracellular space

Animals and grouping
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 230–280 g were provided by Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (NO., SCXK, Shanghai,
2007-0005). Animals were housed in a room with temperature
of 21–23 ◦ C, relative humidity of 30–70%, and a 12-h light/12h dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 h). They had free access to food
and water. All animal experiments was conducted in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued
by National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Laboratory Animal
Resources, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. All procedures used in this study were approved by the local
ethical committee for animal research.
A total of 300 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 60
per group). They are sham-operated group, middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model group, Rg1-treated group, acetazolamidetreated group, and Rg1 plus acetazolamide-treated group. Of the 5
groups, each group was further divided into 5 sub-groups according to the time points of 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d with 12 rats per
sub-group after ischemia/reperfusion. Rg1 was dissolved in normal
saline to the concentration of 5 mg ml−1 , and acetazolamide was
dissolved in soybean oil to the concentration of 25 mg ml−1 . Rats
in Rg1-treated group, acetazolamide-treated group, and Rg1 plus
acetazolamide-treated group were given intraperitoneal injections
of Rg1 (20 mg kg−1 ) plus soybean oil (100 mg kg−1 ), acetazolamide (100 mg kg−1 ) plus normal saline (20 mg kg−1 ) and Rg1
(20 mg kg−1 ) plus acetazolamide (100 mg kg−1 ), respectively. Rats
in sham-operated group and MCAO model group just received
normal saline and soybean oil of same volume, respectively.
Intraperitoneal injections were conducted twice per day and
started 3 days before MCAO model establishment until the animals were killed. In each sub-group, 4 rats were used to assess
AQP4 expression in striatum of lesion side by immunohistochemical analysis and real-time ﬂuorescence quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) respectively, and 4 rats were used to assess
BBB permeability by measuring extravasated Evans blue (EB) dye
in the brain tissue.

Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO as described
previously by Longa et al. (1989). Brieﬂy, rats were initially anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of 10% chloral hydrate at
a dose of 350 mg kg−1 after 12 h fasting. A nylon ﬁlament was
advanced from the external carotid artery into the lumen of internal carotid artery until the rounded tip reached the entrance
to the middle cerebral artery. Following 120 min of MCAO, rats
were re-anaesthetized and the occluding ﬁlament was withdrawn
gently in order to allow reperfusion to take place. Sham-operated
rats underwent the same surgical procedure, except that the ﬁlament was not inserted. Body temperature was maintained at
37–38 ◦ C using a heating pad. The experimenter was blinded to
the treatment that the rats had received prior to all subsequent
analyses.

Neurological deﬁcit scores
Neurological examinations were performed at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d
and 14 d after ischemia/reperfusion by a blinded observer using a
5-point scale published previously by Longa et al. (1989). Rats were
assessed a score between 0 and 4: 0, normal motor function; 1, ﬂexion of the contralateral forepaw upon lifting of the animal by the
tail; 2, circling to the contralateral side; 3, falling to the contralateral side; and 4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level
of consciousness. Only rats with neurological scores of 1–3 were
considered successful models and used in our study.
Measurement of BBB permeability
EB dye was used to investigate the effects of Rg1 on BBB permeability. BBB permeability was assessed by measuring extravasated
EB dye in the brain tissue. EB dye saline solution (4 ml/kg, 2%) was
administered intravenously via the femoral vein and allowed to
circulate for 90 min before the rats sacriﬁced. The animals were
then perfused with normal saline through the left ventricle after
which, brains were removed and dissected. Each hemisphere was
weighed, then heated in water bath for 24 h after the addition of
3 ml of methanamide. Samples were then centrifuged for 20 min
at 5000 rpm and 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The absorbance of the
supernatants was measured at 632 nm with a spectrophotometer
(UV-7502PC, Shanghai Xinmao Instrument Co., Ltd., China) in order
to assess the leakage.
Tissue processing and immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate whether
treatment with Rg1 changes the expression of AQP4 after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Four coronal sections (4 ␮m thick) at
the level of the anterior commissure in the infarct region were
obtained. For IHC analyses, the brain slices were postﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h and then gradient alcoholic dehydrated
and embedded in parafﬁn. After that, sections were deparafﬁnized, antigen repaired for 3 min in sodium citrate buffer (pH
6.0) and incubation with 0.3% H2 O2 in PBS. Sections were then
incubated with 1:200 mouse anti rat AQP4 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 ◦ C. After washing in PBS, brain sections
were incubated with the primary antibodies of IHC detection kit
(PV-9005, ZSGB-BIO Co., Peking, China) for 20 min at 37 ◦ C and
with the secondary antibodies at 37 ◦ C for 30 min, then visualized using 3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB kit,
ZLI-9018, ZSGB-BIO Co., Peking, China). Last, sections were counter
stained with hematoxylin and then gradient alcoholic dehydrated.
Sections were photographed from 5 different angles and slides
were analyzed by professional image analysis software (Image-Pro
Plus 6.0) for semi-quantitative analysis of AQP4 expression according to the integrated optical density (OD) and gray value of positive
cells. All procedures were carried out in a double-blinded manner.
Real-time ﬂuorescence quantitative PCR
Total RNA for AQP4 mRNA determination was isolated from
ipsilateral striatum and then reverse transcribed. The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a ﬁnal volume of 20.55 ␮l containing 2 ␮l of RNA template, 5 ␮l of random primer N6 (100 ␮M),
10 ␮l of 2 × reverse transcription buffer, 3 ␮l of dNTP (2.5 mM),
0.4 ␮l of MMLV Rtase (200 U/␮l), and 0.15 ␮l of Rnasin (40 U/␮l).
After incubating at 37 ◦ C for 60 min, the reverse transcription reaction was terminated by heating at 85 ◦ C for l0 min and then hold at
4 ◦ C. Obtained cDNA was then ampliﬁed by PCR using the following primers: for AQP4, forward 5 -CAGAACCAAGGCGTAGACCG-3 ,
reverse 5 -TCCCTGGAAATGACTGAGAAA-3 , product size: 257 bp;

for DAPDH, forward 5 -GTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTCT-3 , reverse
5 -GGAAGGGGCGGAGATGA-3 , product size: 104 bp. The totally
20 ␮l reaction mixture of PCR consisted of 2 ␮l of cDNA template,
10 ␮l of 2 × Real-time PCR Master Mix, 0.4 ␮l Tap DNA polymerase
(2.5 U/␮l), 0.08 ␮l mRNA F primer (20 ␮M), 0.08 ␮l mRNA R primer
(20 ␮M), and 7.44 ␮l double distilled water.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0. All
experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
Neurological score data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis-of-variance (ANOVA). When sphericity could not
be assumed (Mauchly’s sphericity test: p < 0.05), p-values were
adjusted using the Greenhouse–Geisser correction. Paired t-test
was used for the signiﬁcant difference of EB content between left
and right hemisphere. Comparison between multiple groups were
done using one-way ANOVA and comparison between two groups
were done using two sample t-test. p values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Rg1 improved neurological function
Sham-operated rats did not show visible neurological deﬁcits.
Neurological scores (corresponding to the severity of neurological
deﬁcits) peaked at 3 d and descended gradually for 14 d in the MCAO
model group. After Rg1-treated, acetazolamide-treated or Rg1 plus
acetazolamide-treated, neurological deﬁcit scores could continuously reduce at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d after ischemia/reperfusion
(Fig. 2A). General linear model with repeated measures analysis of
variance for neurological scores at 5 repeated measures showed
that Rg1-treated group (1.00 ± 0.08), acetazolamide-treated group
(1.03 ± 0.08) and Rg1 plus acetazolamide group (0.70 ± 0.08) could
signiﬁcantly reduce the changing trend of neurological deﬁcit
scores when Compared with the MCAO model group (1.55 ± 0.08)
(p < 0.05), and Rg1 plus acetazolamide treatment could further
reduce the changing trend of neurological deﬁcit scores when
compared with the Rg1 and acetazolamide treatment, respectively
(p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B).
Rg1 reduced BBB disruption
BBB disruption occurred at 6 h after ischemia/reperfusion and
reached to the maximum at 3 d, then started to decline. The nonischemic hemispheres were not signiﬁcantly different between
groups (p > 0.05). Compared with sham-operation group, the EB
content of model group signiﬁcantly increased at each time point
(p < 0.05). Compared with model group, ginsenoside Rg1 group,
acetazolamide treatment, and ginsenoside Rg1 plus acetazolamide
group all have signiﬁcantly decreased EB content at each time
point (p < 0.05). Compared ginsenoside Rg1 group with ginsenoside
Rg1 plus acetazolamide group, there were statistically signiﬁcant
differences of EB content at the time points 6 h, 1 d, 3 d after
ischemia/reperfusion (p < 0.05), whereas there were not at the time
points of 7 d and 14 d (p > 0.05) (Fig. 3).
Rg1 downregulated the expression of AQP4
Under the microscope, the positive cells were brown and
AQP4 was found expressing on the cell membrane but not in the
nucleus and cytoplasm. Cavitation and rarefaction of cytoplasm
were shown in the swelling cells. The results of immunohistochemical analysis of AQP4 protein expression (Figs. 4 and 5) and real-time
ﬂuorescence quantitative PCR of AQP4 mRNA expression (Fig. 6)

both showed that AQP4 expression was increased begun with 6 h
after ischemia/reperfusion, then reached to the maximum at 3 d
and still remained at a high level at 7 d. Compared with the shamoperation group, the AQP4 expression increased signiﬁcantly in the

The present study in rats provided the ﬁrst evidence that Rg1
provides neuroprotection against BBB disruption and neurological injury in a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion through
downregulation of AQP4. The main ﬁndings of present study were
that Rg1 could improve neurological injury, attenuate BBB disruption and downregulate AQP4 expression induced by cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion insults in rats. These results suggested that
Rg1 as a neuroprotective agent may be potentially used for acute
ischemic stroke.
Preclinical models of stroke are essential for understanding the
basic mechanisms of ischemic damage and functional recovery

thereafter as well as for the initial testing of neuroprotective
compounds. Rat models for stroke are and will long be the ﬁrst
choice because they are similar vasculature to humans, low cost, a
number of well described behavioral outcome measures compared
with those in mice (Lipsanen and Jolkkonen 2011). Transient
MCAO using the intraluminal thread is the most common used
reperfusion model in rats (Longa et al. 1989), and the same authors
developed a 0–4 neurologic grading scale to assess neurological
function impairment following cerebral ischemia (Longa et al.
1989). In the present study, we applied this 5-point scale to evaluate extent of the neurological deﬁcit. The score in the model group
was increased at 6 h of reperfusion, peaked at 3 d, then declined
with time going. In Rg1-treated group, the score was decreased
from the beginning and neurological deﬁcits were signiﬁcantly
attenuated compared with the model group at each time point.
These results strongly suggest Rg1 treatment promotes neurological functional recovery after stroke. When combined Rg1 with
acetazolamide, which is a reversible inhibitor of AQP4 (Tanimura
et al. 2009), the functional recovery was stronger and more stable.
Disruption of BBB is a critical event during cerebral ischemia,
followed by passive diffusion of water leading to vasogenic edema
and secondary brain injury. Cerebral edema is a major and potentially fatal complication of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, BBB
has been one of major targets for the understanding of mechanisms mediating cerebral ischemia damage and for development
of new treatment for ischemic stroke (O’Donnell et al. 2004). In the
present study, we studied the effect of Rg1 on BBB disruption and
the data showed that Evans blue content, as an indicator of BBB

permeability, distinctly increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere at
each time point after ischemia/reperfusion and Rg1 treatment signiﬁcantly attenuated the leakage of EB. These data showed that
Rg1 could reduce BBB disruption to some extent after cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion.
The neuroprotective effect of Rg1 has well been established in
the many other studies in the recent decades, and their mechanisms
revealed that Rg1 can increase hypoxia inducible factor-1␣ levels,
activate nitric oxide synthase activity and N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptors as well as glucocorticoid receptors and L-type voltagedependent Ca2+ channels, and upregulated vascular endothelial
growth factor expression (Jiang et al. 2012; Shen and Zhang 2007;
Tang et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2008). In the present study, we studied the effect of Rg1 on expression levels of AQP4 at the same
time point as for Evans blue leakage. Consistent with the result
of EB, the data showed that AQP4 was upregulated and markedly
expressed in the ipsilateral hemisphere at each time point after
ischemia/reperfusion and Rg1 treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited the
expression of AQP4. These results supported that AQP4 is involved
in the BBB breakdown after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
Thus, Rg1 treatment reduced AQP4 expression corresponded to its
protective effect against BBB breakdown, further suggesting that
Rg1 protects BBB integrity after ischemia/reperfusion by blocking
AQP4.
It is worth noting that the neuroprotective activity of Rg1 for
acute ischemic stroke may raise a concern that all Ginsenosides
possess this activity because several other Ginsenosides, such as
Rh2 (Park et al. 2004), Rb and Ro (Zhang et al. 2006), Rg3 (Tian et al.
2009), and Rd (Ye et al. 2011), also have neuroprotective effects
in ischemic brain injury. However, we cannot conclude that all
ginsenosides possess neuroprotective activity due to the following
reasons: (1) Ginsenosides have been divided into two groups: PPDtype and PPT-type. In the PPD group, sugar residues are attached
to the ␣-OH at C-3 and/or C-20. In the PPT group, sugar moieties
are attached to the ␤-OH at C-6 and/or ␤-OH at C-20 (Qu et al.
2009). Since there are big differences in their chemical structures,
it is hardly to conclude that all Ginsenosides have same biological
activity from the point view of chemistry. (2) The ginsenosides’
potent anti-oxidative activity plays an important role on the
neuroprotecive effects in insulted ischemic brains (Siddique et al.
2000). However, ginsenoside aglycones have different antioxidant
abilities. Ginsenosides Rg2, Rg3 and Rh2 were prooxidative;
ginsenosides Rb1, Rc, R1, Rd, Re, Rb3, Rg1, and Rh1 functioned as
antioxidants (Liu et al. 2003). In an in vitro cortical cell model, only
ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg3 exerted efﬁcacious in protecting neurons
from oxidative damage, whereas other ginsenosides such as Rb2,
Rc, Re, Rg2, Rh1, and Rh2, Rg1 and Rg5 had no neuroprotective
activities (Kim et al. 1998). It suggested that the neuroprotective
activities of different ginsenosides may be various. (3) Although
several ginsenosides showed neuroprotective activity, most of the
studies in this ﬁeld are explanatory on the therapeutic potential
of ginseng compounds with little explanation of mechanism of
action, especially on the causal relationship of the molecular or
biological changes induced by ginsenosides on therapeutic action.
Even if the similar neuroprotective activity was found in two
ginsenoside groups such as Rg3 (Tian et al. 2009) and Rg1 in the
present study, the anti-ischemic effects of Ginsenosides may have
different molecular and biological mechanism of actions. Tian et al.
(2009) indicated that PPD-type ginsenoside Rg3 could inhibit the
opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores by free
radical scavenging action in the rat brain, suggesting its mechanism of neuroprotective actions as an antioxidant and inhibitor
of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores. In the present
study, we indicated that a novel molecular mechanism, regulation
of AQP4 expression by PPT-type ginsenosides Rg1, is involved in
the potent neuroprotective actions, and this effect of AQP4 on the

Y. Zhou et al. / Phytomedicine 21 (2014) 998–1003

neuroprotective activity of Rg1 has not yet been reported. Thus,
whether the neuroprotective effects of different Ginsenosides in
acute ischemic stroke may have same or different molecular and
biological mechanisms is worthy of further exploration.
In conclusions, the present study demonstrated that Rg1 can
improve neurological function deﬁcits and reduce BBB disruption
after focal cerebral ischemia. The mechanism of this neuroprotection by Rg1 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion may be through
downregulation of AQP4 expression.
