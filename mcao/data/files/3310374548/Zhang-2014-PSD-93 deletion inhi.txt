a b s t r a c t
Modiﬁcation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity appears to be a potential
target in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Postsynaptic density protein-93 (PSD-93) speciﬁcally binds
the C-terminal tails of the NMDAR, which is critical to couple NMDAR activity to speciﬁc intracellular signaling.
This study is to investigate whether PSD-93 disruption displays neuroprotection in a focal ischemic stroke model
of adult mice and, if it does, to explore possible mechanisms.
It was found that, following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), PSD-93 knockout (KO) mice manifested
signiﬁcant reductions in infarcted volume, neurological deﬁcits and number of degenerated neurons. PSD-93
deletion also reduced cultured cortical neuronal death caused by glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD). Ischemic
long term potentiation (i-LTP) could not be induced in the PSD-93 KO group and wild type (WT) groups
pretreated with either AP-5 (NMDAR inhibitor) or PP2 (Src family inhibitor). PSD-93 KO decreased the phosphorylation of the NR2B at Tyr1472 and the interaction between NR2B and Fyn after MCAO. Together, our study
demonstrated that PSD-93 KO confers profound neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury, which probably
links to the inhibitory effect on Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of NR2B caused by PSD-93 deletion. These ﬁndings
may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Excitotoxicity mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
is a hyper-acute pathologic hallmark of ischemic stroke and is spatiotemporally related to the occurrence of inﬂammation and delayed apoptotic
cell death (Kalia et al., 2008). NMDARs are heteromeric complexes mainly
including NR1, NR2A-NR2B and NR3 subunits. Among them, NR2
subunits are thought to play a vital role in the synaptic localization and
transmission of NMDAR (Aarts and Tymianski, 2004). However, drugs

targeting NMDAR did not beneﬁt stroke patients, as was expected in
clinical trials, which indicates a need for further investigation of NMDAR
and its downstream signaling (Hardingham, 2009).
Postsynaptic density protein-93 (PSD-93), a principal member of
membrane-associated guanylate kinase family (MAGUKs), speciﬁcally
binds the C-terminal tails of the NR2 through its PDZ (postsynaptic
density 95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) domains in the postsynaptic
density (Brenman et al., 1996). This structural combination is critical to
cluster NMDAR and couple NMDAR activity to speciﬁc intracellular proteins and signaling enzymes. A previous study has already established
that PSD-93 disruption impairs the NMDAR function by inhibiting the
Ca2+/nNOS/cGMP pathway (Zhang et al., 2010) and inhibits plateletactivating factor-induced neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons (Xu
et al., 2004). These reports predicted that PSD-93 serves as a critical scaffolding protein in the signaling and plasticity of NMDAR in vitro.
In an in vivo study, PSD-93 disruption has been documented to alleviate persistent pain following peripheral nerve injury (Zhang et al.,
2003). However, deletion of PSD-93 does not provide neuroprotection
after neonatal hypoxia ischemia (Jiang et al., 2003). Due to the different
compositions and properties of NMDARs between neonates and adults

M. Zhang et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 68 (2014) 104–111

(Zhou and Baudry, 2006), the predicted role of PSD-93 in adult focal
ischemic injury is likely different.
Tyrosine phosphorylation has emerged as a prominent mechanism
that regulates NMDAR trafﬁcking and function (Chen and Roche,
2007). The Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs), including Src,
Fyn, Yes and Lyn, are reported to exist in the NMDA receptor complex
and promote tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B (Chen and
Roche, 2007). Up-regulation of the NR2B via phosphorylation by Src
has been required for the NMDAR-dependent neurotoxicity in ischemic
injury (Jiang et al., 2008). PSD-95, another member of MAGUK family,
could facilitate the interaction between SFKs and NMDAR and consequently promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR (Tezuka
et al., 1999; Hou et al., 2003). Additionally, recent studies postulated
that PSD-93 mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B
through forming a complex with Fyn in the synaptosomal membrane
of intact neurons (Sato et al., 2008). However, it remains unknown
whether PSD-93 participates in the phosphorylation of NMDAR mediated by SFKs and subsequently exacerbates cerebral ischemic injury.
To gain more insight into the possible roles of PSD-93, this study
investigated whether PSD-93 disruption displayed neuroprotection in
a focal ischemic stroke model of adult mice and explored the mechanism responsible for it.

Materials and methods
Animals
The PSD-93 KO mice (C57BL/6 genetic background) were produced
as described previously (Zhang et al., 2010). Male PSD-93 KO mice and
WT littermates (10–12 weeks) were obtained by interbreeding PSD-93
heterozygous mice. The genotype of each mouse was conﬁrmed by
polymerase chain reaction. All animal experiments were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing University.

Cell culture and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)
Primary cortical neurons from WT and PSD-93 KO embryos were
dissected and cultured in neural basal media with a supplement of
antibiotic-free B27 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were plated in dishes at 2 × 105/cm2. On the 10th day, neural basal media were exchanged for OGD media (CSS media: NaCl
120 mM, KCl 5.4 mM, CaCl2 1.8 mM, and buffered with 25 Tris, pH 7.4)
and then incubated in a hypoxia chamber (Billups – Rothenberg, Del
Mar, CA) that was previously ﬂushed with 5% CO2/95% N2 at 2 psi
(1 psi = 6.89 kPA) for 15 min. The chambers were sealed and incubated
at 37 °C for 2 h. Then cells were returned to the neural basal media and
incubated under normal conditions at 37 °C for indicated time durations.

Mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Male C57/B6 mice and PSD-93 KO mice (weight 25–30 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/ml) and
xylazine (20 mg/kg) mixture (1:1) at a dose of 1 ml/kg. Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C by a temperature-regulated heating
pad. MCAO was achieved by the intraluminal ﬁlament methods previously described (Zhang et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, a 6-0 monoﬁlament nylon
suture with heat-rounded tip was inserted through the external carotid
artery and advanced into the internal carotid artery to occlude the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of occlusion, the ﬁlament was
withdrawn to allow for reperfusion at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 7 days and the
brains were quickly removed for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC)
staining, Nissl stain, FJB stain or protein extraction. In sham group, we
inserted the suture into the external carotid but fail to advance it to
the origin of the MCA. Two hours later, the ﬁlament was withdrawn.
TTC staining and neurological behavior test
To evaluate the infarcted size of each mouse, six mice in each group
were quickly decapitated at the indicated reperfusion time. Fresh brain
tissues were sliced into coronal sections at a thickness of 2 mm and
incubated with 2% TTC solution for 30 min at 37 °C. After ﬁxation with
4% formaldehyde, slices were photographed and infarcted areas were
accessed blind using NIH Image J software (Bethesda, MD). Infarct
volume was a summation of infarcted areas in ﬁve slices and expressed
as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Animal performance
was evaluated at 6, 24, 48 h following MCAO by Neurological Severity
Scores as described previously (Chen et al., 2010). Neurological function
was graded on a scale of 0 to 18 with normal score 0 and maximal deﬁcit
score 18. Ten mice were evaluated in each group by an experimenter
blinded to the experiments.
Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining and Nissl staining
FJB (Millipore, MA, USA) staining was performed to detect neuronal
degeneration 48 h after ischemic injury as described previously (Zhang
et al., 2013). Mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with
0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Frozen brain sections were cut 20 μM thick and incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate for 15 min followed by 0.001% FJB staining in 0.09% acetic acid for
20 min. After complete rinse by distilled water, images were observed
using a ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). Data were presented
as number of positive cells per mm2. In order to evaluate ischemic injury
7 days after surgery, cresyl violet staining was applied to differentiate
damaged tissue from normal tissue. Frozen brain sections cut 10 μM
thick were stained with 0.1% cresyl violet for 15 min and then differentiated with 70% ethanol for 1 min. Sections were scanned and tissue losses
were presented as (contralateral hemisphere area − ipsilateral infarcted
area)/contralateral hemisphere area.

Cell viability and death

Western blot (WB) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)

Following treatment indicated above, cell viability and death were
assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Li et al., 2013).
Brieﬂy, neurons in 96-well plates were immersed in 0.5 mg/ml MTT
for 4 h. Then, the supernatant was removed and 100 μl dimethyl sulfoxide was added for optical density detection at 570 nm using an ELISA
plate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). Data were presented as percentages
of the value of untreated control cells. For PI staining, cultured cells were
suspended and exposed to 50 μg/ml PI (Sigma, MO, USA) in the dark.
Ten minutes later, an FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, USA) was used to measure
single-cell light scattering and ﬂuorescence. Dead cells in each group
were presented as percentages of total cells.

WT and KO mice were killed 6 h or 24 h after MCAO for WB and co-IP.
Protein extraction and qualiﬁcation were performed using standard
methods described previously (Zhao et al., 2013). Equal quantities
of protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against PSD-93 (Invitrogen, CA, USA, 1:1000), PSD-95
(Cell Signaling, MA, USA, 1:1000), NR2A (Millipore, MA, USA, 1:1000),
NR2B (Millipore, MA, USA, 1:1000), nNOS (Cell Signaling, MA, USA,
1:1000), Fyn (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, 1:200), and 4G10 (Millipore, MA,
USA, 1:500). The proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and visualized using chemiluminescence reagents provided with the ECL kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway). GAPDH (Santa Cruz, CA,

106

M. Zhang et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 68 (2014) 104–111

USA, 1:1000) was used as loading control. The intensity of blots was
quantiﬁed using of NIH image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
For co-IP, about 500 μg protein was diluted in 500 μl PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor (Sigma, MO, USA, 1:100). Samples were then
pre-incubated with antibodies against NR2A or NR2B (Millipore, MA,
USA, 1:500), Fyn (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, 1:200), and PSD-93 (Invitrogen,
CA, USA, 1:500) at 4 °C overnight on the rolling device. After adding 20
μl Protein A/G agarose bead slurry (Millipore, MA, USA) to the mixture,
rolling was continued at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The beads were
washed 3 times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer. Then, samples were eluted
by SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant was
used for the following WB experiments.
Electrophysiological recordings
Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampus slices have been
described previously (Bagetta et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, hippocampus slices
(400 μM) were cut using a vibrating microtome (Microslicer DTK 1500,
Dousaka EMCo, Kyoto, Japan). After 1 h recovery, hippocampal slices
were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused continually with
artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) composed of NaCl 124 mM, KCl 2
mM, KH2PO4 1.25 mM, MgSO4 2 mM, CaCl2 2 mM, NaHCO3 26 mM, glucose 10 mM oxygenated with a gas mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2. Oxygen
glucose deprivation (OGD) was induced by perfusing the slices with
glucose-free ACSF in a gas mixture containing 95% N2/5% CO2 for 5 min.
Glucose was totally removed from ACSF and sucrose was added to balance the osmolarity. At the end of OGD, normal ACSF and humidiﬁed
gas were added to the slices. Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
was recorded with a 4–5 MΩ resistance glass microelectrode ﬁlled
with 0.9% NaCl and ampliﬁed with a differential AC ampliﬁer (A-M Systems, model 1700, Seattle, WA). The slope of EPSP was analyzed using
the pCLAMP system (Axon Instrument Inc., Foster City, CA). The PP2 (1
μM) or AP-5 (1 μM) was added in ACSF solution.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± SEM except for the NSS score.
NSS scores are presented as median ± range. Data on tissue loss,
infarcted volume at each time point, were analyzed with the t-test.
NSS score was analyzed by Mann–Whitney U-test. Data on neuronal
death counts, MTT assay, PI staining, optical density of western blots
bands were analyzed with ANOVA followed by post hoc Scheffe's tests
using SPSS 11.5. Signiﬁcance was set at p b 0.05.
Results
PSD-93 knockout protects the brain against injury in MCAO mice
To investigate whether PSD-93 mediates neurotoxicity after ischemic stroke in vivo, mice subjected to 2 h MCAO and 6 h, 24 h, and 72 h
reperfusion were sacriﬁced for measuring infarct size by TTC. PSD-93
knockout mice had signiﬁcant reduction in infarct size compared with
WT mice following MCAO (6 h: 0.06 ± 0.021 in KO versus 0.27 ± 0.04
in WT, p b 0.05; 24 h: 0.16 ± 0.05 in KO versus 0.35 ± 0.05 in WT,
p b 0.05; 72 h: 0.12 ± 0.03 in KO versus 0.40 ± 0.09 in WT, p b 0.05)
(Fig. 1A and C). The neurological deﬁcit of each mouse was measured
by NSS score. As shown in Fig. 1B, PSD-93 KO mice also manifested
better behavioral performance at 24 h and 48 h in contrast with control
group (24 h: 10 ± 6 in KO versus 12 ± 2 in WT, p b0.05; 48 h: 9 ± 6 in
KO versus 11 ± 3 in WT, p b0.05) (Fig. 1B).
A prolonged protection therapy is usually required for ischemic
stroke, especially for therapeutic strategy mainly targeting excitotoxicity
(an extremely early pathological progress of stroke). Thus, cresyl violet
staining was performed to evaluate tissue loss on the 7th recovery day
after MCAO. It is noteworthy that tissue loss on day 7 in WT mice and

KO mice were 29.47% ± 2.52% and 11.92% ± 1.62% (p b 0.05, Fig. 1D
and E).
To further verify whether PSD-93 KO could alleviate ischemic brain
injury at the histological level, degenerated neurons were detected
using FJB staining 48 h after MCAO in the infarcted regions of the striatum and cortex. As Fig. 2A and B show, sham group mice were nearly
devoid of green ﬂuorescent neurons, while a profound increase of
degenerated neurons was observed 48 h after MCAO in WT mice
(1051.34 ± 163.63/mm2 in cortex; 1038.64 ± 66.11/mm2 in striatum).
By contrast, the numbers of dying neurons in KO mice were much lower
(452.21 ± 69.20/mm2 in cortex, p b 0.01; 185.54 ± 134.14/mm2 in striatum, p b 0.01). Together, data indicated that PSD-93 deletion improved
stroke outcome.
PSD-93 deletion reduces neuronal death after ischemia in vitro
To verify whether PSD-93 KO could protect neurons from damage
induced by OGD, neurons were harvested, following 2 h OGD and 24 h
reperfusion, for MTT assay and PI staining. As shown in Fig. 3A, 2 h
OGD resulted in a 41.04% decline of cell viability in WT neurons by
MTT. However, PSD-93 KO neurons were resistant to ischemic injury
displaying only 32.42% decline of cell viability after OGD exposure
(p b0.05). The results of PI staining showed that cell death is signiﬁcantly enhanced when exposed to OGD. However, compared to WT mice,
PSD-93 KO signiﬁcantly prevented cell death after OGD (34.97% ±
1.95% in WT group vs. 24.33% ± 1.86% in KO group, p b0.05) (Fig. 3B
and C), indicating that PSD-93 plays a detrimental role in the progress
of ischemic neuronal death.
PSD-93 deletion abolished ischemia-induced long term potentiation
As a scaffolding protein locating mainly in the postsynaptic density,
PSD-93 was thought to participate in synaptic transmission and plasticity. For instance, PSD-93 mutant mice exhibit impaired LTP by theta
frequency (5 Hz) stimulation (Carlisle et al., 2008). To explore the
effects of PSD-93 deletion on ischemia-induced neuronal excitotoxicity,
we observed the induction of ischemia-induced LTP in PSD-93 KO
mice. In hippocampal slices subjected to 5 min OGD, the EPSP slope at
the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses slightly reduced within 5 min following replacement of ACSF, then rapidly increased by approximately
1.7-fold of baseline throughout the observation period for over 60 min
(n = 12 slices/6 mice; Fig. 4A), indicative of ischemia-induced long
term potentiation. By contrast, i-LTP could not be induced in PSD-93
KO mice (n = 12 slices/6 mice; Fig. 4B). In addition, the treatment
with either the Src inhibitor PP2 (1 μM) or the NMDA receptor antagonist
AP-5 was able to block the induction of i-LTP (n = 12 slices/6 mice;
Fig. 4C and D). The results indicate that Src family, NMDAR, participates
in the formation of i-LTP, while PSD-93 deletion could abolish i-LTP.
Expression pattern of NDMAR, PSD-93 and PSD-95 after focal ischemia
As demonstrated above, it is believed that PSD-93 participates in the
neurotoxicity induced by ischemia and PSD-93 mutant protects neurons
against ischemic injury. Then, PSD-93 expression in normal or ischemic
conditions in WT mice were detected by western blotting. The protein
was then extracted from WT or PSD-93 KO cortex in the penumbra
region at 6 h, 24 h, and 72 h reperfusion after MCAO and the PSD-93
expression was evaluated by western blotting. The expression of PSD93 signiﬁcantly increased at 6 h (3.24-fold of control) and then gradually decreased. Until 24 h (2.66-fold of control) and 72 h (2.06-fold of control) reperfusion after MCAO, the protein levels were still higher than
that of intact mice (Fig. 5A and B).
Data in the electrophysiological recordings provided a hint that neuroprotection of PSD-93 deletion may largely depend on NMDAR and the
Src kinase family. Four members of the Src family, including Src, Fyn, Yes
and Lyn, are involved in the NMDA receptor complex. Of them, Src, Yes,

and Lyn were reported to not physically interact with PSD-93 (Kalia and
Salter, 2003). Recent studies reported that PSD-93 clusters Fyn in the
postsynaptic density (Sato et al., 2008). The expression of NR2A, NR2B,
Fyn, PSD-95 and nNOS was further detected in WT and PSD-93 mice at
6 h, 24 h and 72 h after MCAO. Data showed that there is no signiﬁcant
difference in NR2A, NR2B, nNOS, PSD-95 and Fyn between the WT and
PSD-93 KO groups at each time point, suggesting that PSD-93 did not
affect the expression of NMDAR and Fyn (Fig. 5C).
PSD-93 enhanced Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B
Tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR by the Src kinase family has been
reported to play a causative role in ischemia damage. Whether Fyn was
the responsible member which medicated the tyrosine phosphorylation
of NR2B was next examined. The association of NR2B with Fyn was
then determined by co-IP with anti-NR2B and blotted with Fyn antibody.
As shown in Fig. 6A and B, the association of Fyn with NR2B dramatically
increased at 6 h after MCAO (1.55-fold of WT sham group), which was
partially reversed in PSD-93 deﬁcient mice (1.04-fold of WT sham
group, p b0.05 versus sham group).
Tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B was then investigated using
4G10 antibody and co-IP. Results demonstrated that PSD-93 deﬁciency
suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B at 6 h after MCAO (6 h
after MCAO: 1.64-fold of sham in WT, 40% of sham in KO, p b 0.05)
(Fig. 6C and D). Multiple phosphorylation sites of NR2B were discovered
currently, while Tyr1472 is critical to NMDAR function and its mediated

excitotoxicity (Nakazawa et al., 2001; Chen and Roche, 2007). The expression of Tyr1472 of NR2B was then determined and it was found that
Tyr1472 of NR2B was signiﬁcantly inhibited by PSD-93 disruption (6 h:
1.64-fold of sham in WT, 92.1% of sham in KO, p b 0.05) (Fig. 6D and E).
Discussion
In this study, it was initially demonstrated that PSD-93 KO blocks
ischemia-induced long term potentiation and confers profound neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury in experimental stroke models.
This protection may link to the inhibitory effect on Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B caused by PSD-93 deletion. These ﬁndings may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of ischemic stroke
and other neurological disorders involving excitotoxicity.
PSD-93 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1996, mainly in the cerebral cortex,
cerebellum and hippocampus of the brain, myenteric neurons of the
intestine and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal
ganglia (Brenman et al., 1996; Tao et al., 2003). It comprises three PDZ
domains at the N-terminal side, one Src homology region 3 (SH3)
domain in the middle and one guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain at
the C-terminal end (Brenman et al., 1998). Its speciﬁc PDZ domain has
been indentiﬁed to interact with multiple proteins and enzymes
(Harris and Lim, 2001). Thus, PSD-93 was expected to play a prominent
role in synaptic transmission and locations. However, PSD-93 (a unique
MAGUK member in the cerebellum) KO mice displayed normal cerebellar Purkinje cell architecture and normal excitatory postsynaptic current

(McGee et al., 2001), which provides a hint that PSD-93 does not participate in baseline synaptic function but may have critical roles during
pathological situations. Previous studies showed that cultured cortical
PSD-93 KO inhibited neuronal vulnerability to NMDA (Zhang et al.,
2010) or platelet-activating factor (Xu et al., 2004) induced toxicity. In
this current study, it was observed that PSD-93 mutant decreased the
number of degenerated neurons caused by MCAO in vivo and inhibited
OGD-induced neuronal death in vitro, although neuron morphology and
localization of PSD-93 mutant mice appear to be normal. Additionally,
cerebral protection in vivo presented with decreased infarcted size and
tissue loss is much more obvious than that in vitro presented decreased
cell viability and increased cell death. Thus, beside neurons, PSD-93
may interact other cells or micro-vessels to covalently protect against
ischemia injury.
Besides PSD-93, the MAGUKs family still comprises PSD-95, SAP102,
and SAP97. The amino acid sequences of PSD-95 protein are 71% identical to PSD-93 and PSD-95 protein has been considered a promising
target in treating ischemic stroke (Bach et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2012).
Worries about PSD-95 still remain. For instance, PSD-95 KO mice exhibit
LTP enhancement and LTD disruption, resulting in learning and memory
impairment (Migaud et al., 1998).
PSD-93 has some unique properties compared to PSD-95. Structurally, PSD-93 differs from PSD-95 in the PDZ1 domain and so could interact
preferentially with different binding partners (Fiorentini et al., 2009).
Palmitoylation is not essential for PSD-93 postsynaptic targeting, but
prerequisite for PSD-95 to protect the C-terminus of NMDAR from the
proteolysis (Dong et al., 2004). Functionally, PSD-93 KO mice exhibit
deﬁcits in LTD and normal LTP (Carlisle et al., 2008). Additionally,
PSD-93 alters the calcium inﬂux through NMDAR (Zhang et al., 2010),
while calcium inﬂux remains intact in PSD-95 KO neurons exposed
to NMDA (Sattler et al., 1999). In this regard, evaluating PSD-93 in
ischemic stroke is still necessary.

Here it was ﬁrst found that PSD-93 deﬁciency reduced the volume of
total cerebral infarction by 28% of WT mice at 72 h reperfusion time. In
parallel, improved neurological function after stroke gauged by NSS
score is unequivocally achievable in PSD-93 KO mice. Moreover, cresyl
violet stain demonstrated that tissue loss was less severe in PSD-93
KO mice than in WT mice on the 7th recovery day after MCAO. However,
contradictory evidence from studies in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia at
postnatal day 7 showed that deletion of PSD-93 alone does not provide
neuroprotection (Jiang et al., 2003). In Jiang's study, signiﬁcant higher
expressions of PSD-95, NR2A and nNOS were observed in PSD null
mice than in WT mice at 24 h after neonatal global ischemia in hippocampus regions, which may counteract with the possible protective
effect of PSD-93 KO.
This study demonstrated that PSD-93 deletion did not enhance the
levels of PSD-95, NR2A, NR2B and nNOS after adult focal cerebral ischemia in the cerebral cortex. Compensatory response of the PSD-95NMDAR complex may vary depending on developmental stage, brain
area, and the model of disease. Nevertheless, results from this current
study strongly suggested that PSD-93 deﬁciency protected against
ischemic injury in vivo and in vitro.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B by SFKs contributes to the alteration of NMDAR function and relates to pathogenic events in the ischemic brain (Ali and Salter, 2001; Takagi et al., 2003). Administration of
the SFKs inhibitor PP2 alleviates hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell
death after transient global brain ischemia (Hou et al., 2007; Jiang
et al., 2008). In line with these reports, the current study also showed
that bathing hippocampus slices with PP2 or AP-5 fully prevented i-LTP
in WT mice. An event occurring very early in ischemia injury is the increase in spontaneous glutamate neurotransmitter release (Fleidervish
et al., 2001) that leads to enhanced excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSC) (Katchman and Hershkowitz, 1994). Such an enhanced activation of glutamate AMPA/NMDA receptors should lead to Na+/Ca2 +

overloading contributing to early neuronal damage. PSD-93 deletion
impaired the i-LTP probably through modifying NMDAR excitotoxicity.
In this study, cerebral ischemia followed by 6 h reperfusion promoted the formation of NR2B-Fyn complex and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B. Currently, three Fyn-mediated phosphorylation

residues in the C-terminal regions of NR2B have been indentiﬁed in
human embryonic kidney ﬁbroblasts — Tyr1252, Tyr1336, and Tyr1472.
Among them, Tyr1472 is largely related to the induction of long term
potentiation in the hippocampus CA1 district (Nakazawa et al., 2001),
indicating that Tyr1472 is critical to NMDAR function. PSD-93 KO

decreased the interaction between NR2B Fyn and NR2B Tyr1472 site
phosphorylation, which may, at least in part, contribute to the neuroprotection of PSD-93 deletion.
The reasons why PSD-93 KO precludes Fyn from NR2B are unknown.
Several rationales could be proposed here, based on current literature,
which call for further clariﬁcation. PSD-93 itself is a substrate of Fyn
and phosphorylated PSD-93 is able to bind Csk, which negatively regulates the activity of Fyn (Nada et al., 2003). Thus, PSD-93 deletion may
affect the kinase activity of Fyn by disrupting this feedback loop. On
the other hand, association of Fyn with NR2B resulted in the phosphorylation of NR2B (Tezuka et al., 1999), while PSD-93 may function as an
anchoring protein to recruit Fyn and form Fyn/PSD-93/NR2B complex.
Collectively, the current study preliminarily documents that PSD-93
is a potential target downstream of NDMAR in the treatment of ischemic
stroke in the mature brain. The mechanism may be associated with Fynmediated tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B.
