Spreading depolarization-induced adenosine accumulation
reﬂects metabolic status in vitro and in vivo
Britta E Lindquist and C William Shuttleworth
Spreading depolarization (SD), a pathologic feature of migraine, stroke and traumatic brain injury, is a propagating depolarization of
neurons and glia causing profound metabolic demand. Adenosine, the low-energy metabolite of ATP, has been shown to be
elevated after SD in brain slices and under conditions likely to trigger SD in vivo. The relationship between metabolic status and
adenosine accumulation after SD was tested here, in brain slices and in vivo. In brain slices, metabolic impairment (assessed by
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) autoﬂuorescence and O2 availability) was associated with prolonged extracellular
direct current (DC) shifts indicating delayed repolarization, and increased adenosine accumulation. In vivo, adenosine accumulation
was observed after SD even in otherwise healthy mice. As in brain slices, in vivo adenosine accumulation correlated with DC shift
duration and increased when DC shifts were prolonged by metabolic impairment (i.e., hypoglycemia or middle cerebral artery
occlusion). A striking pattern of adenosine dynamics was observed during focal ischemic stroke, with nearly all the observed
adenosine signals in the periinfarct region occurring in association with SDs. These ﬁndings suggest that adenosine accumulation
could serve as a biomarker of SD incidence and severity, in a range of clinical conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Spreading depolarization (SD) of brain tissue is a self-propagating
wave of neuronal and glial activation, carried by large transmembrane currents that depolarize cells and disrupt ionic gradients.1,2
Spreading depolarization imposes a large metabolic burden on
brain tissue, evidenced by depletion of energy substrates and
O23,4 and by accumulation of metabolic byproducts such as lactate
and H+.5,6 ATP concentration drops by nearly 50% during SD in
normoxic conditions,7 and metabolic depletion is expected to be
more severe when occurring in tissue with limited substrate
availability.
Recent clinical studies strongly suggest that SD is involved in
the pathophysiology of migraine with aura, thromboembolic stroke,
traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.8 While
normoxic, normoglycemic SD can be noninjurious,9 SD in the
setting of metabolic compromise exacerbates neuronal injury.10,11
Work in animal models has identiﬁed delayed repolarization,
marked by prolonged extracellular direct current (DC) shifts, as a
hallmark of injurious SD in metabolically compromised tissue.10
Observational studies in human subjects have conﬁrmed the
association between prolonged DC shifts and poor outcome after
SD,12 but human studies have so far been limited by the requirement for invasive electrical recordings in patients with craniotomies. It would be helpful to establish additional biomarkers of
metabolic status, to assess vulnerability to SD in injured brain.
Extracellular adenosine accumulation can serve as a global
indicator of energy charge. Adenosine, a metabolic byproduct of
ATP hydrolysis, accumulates in the extracellular space when energy
demand exceeds supply.13 As such, adenosine accumulation

reports changes in ATP concentration without necessitating any
assumptions about the upstream cause of metabolic deterioration;
it can be triggered by isolated hypoxia or hypoglycemia,14 or highoutput conditions such as seizure.15 Thus, extracellular adenosine
serves as an integrator of net metabolic status. We have recently
used electrochemical detection methods in brain slices to verify
that adenosine accumulates after K+-induced SD,16 possibly indicating the severity of this metabolic challenge. Whether adenosine
accumulation can be detected after SD in vivo is not yet clear.
Although adenosine increases have been reported in the settings
where SD is most likely to occur (i.e., potassium infusion,
ischemia,17,18 and traumatic brain injury19), these studies have
been conducted largely without monitoring for SD. One study that
did assess SD found a clear temporal association between adenosine peaks and electroencephalographic suppression,20 although
the sampling method made pulsatile adenosine dynamics difﬁcult
to resolve, and relationships to DC shift durations or metabolic
status were not elucidated.
In the present study, we report adenosine signals associated
with SD in brain slices and in vivo. We ﬁrst tested whether
metabolic status could modulate adenosine accumulation in brain
slices subjected to SD, and then compared SD-associated
adenosine release in vivo, under healthy, hypoglycemic, and
ischemic conditions. Our ﬁndings suggest that adenosine can be a
useful indicator of unmet metabolic demand in the wake of SD,
and could provide a useful adjunct or alternative to electrical
recordings to assess recovery from SD in compromised
tissues. Preliminary ﬁndings of this study have been published
in abstract form.21

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Brain Slice Preparation
All animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the
University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC, Animal Welfare Assurance #A3350-01, USDA
Registration #85-R-0014) in accordance with U.S. Animal Welfare Regulations and Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.22 Adult C57Bl/6 mice (n = 20) were anesthetized with
ketamine/xylazine, decapitated, and brain slices were prepared as
described previously.16 From each animal, a series of coronal slices was
prepared at 250 μm, 350 μm, and 450 μm thicknesses, and a distribution of
rostral, intermediate, and caudal slices of each thickness was included in
each series of experiments. Slices recovered in artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(aCSF) at 35°C for 1 hour then were held at room temperature until being
used for experiments.

Brain Slice Recordings
Slices were transferred to a submersion-style ﬂow chamber (RC-27L,
Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) and continuously superfused at a
rate of 2 ml/minute with aCSF (34°C to 35°C). Lycra slice supports suspended the slice 0.5 mm above the coverslip ﬂoor of the chamber, and a
meniscus was formed with the immersion objective, such that carboxygenated aCSF continuously bathed both top and bottom faces of the
slice. SD was generated by microinjection of KCl 1 M, and detected with
extracellular electrodes (DC shifts), and propagation tracked with intrinsic
optical signals (4600 nm transmitted light) as described previously.16
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) autoﬂuorescence signals were assessed in some studies following methods previously
described.23 Brieﬂy, after excitation at 360 nm illumination (Polychrome V,
FEI Life Sciences, Munich, Germany), endogenous ﬂuorescence emission
was band-pass ﬁltered 510 ± 42 nm (ﬁlter-set from Semrock, Rochester, NY,
USA) and collected by interline transfer CCD camera (Imago, FEI Life
Sciences), with 4 × 4 binning, 0.5 to 2 Hz. In some studies, partial pressure
of O2 (pO2) was measured using a temperature-compensated luminescence quenching Oxymicro probe (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,
FL, USA) placed at the surface of the slice (spatial resolution o 50 μm,
temporal resolution o 1 second, 1 Hz acquisition). O2 probes were
calibrated daily using water-saturated air and O2-free water solution
(sodium sulﬁte 1% w/v), and signals were converted to mm Hg using local

barometric pressure. The O2 probes generated 505 nm excitation that
interfered with NAD(P)H signal acquisition. However, since the frequency
of O2 and NAD(P)H signal acquisitions were at different rates (1 Hz versus
0.5 to 2 Hz for O2 and NAD(P)H, respectively) and not aligned with each
other, the number of frames contaminated with O2 excitation signals were
minimal, and could be removed without distortion of NAD(P)H transients.
All signals (DC, NAD(P)H and O2) were co-registered according to the KCl
pulse, using either the TTL pulse on the KCl picospritzer (for NAD(P)H) or
the pulse artifact on electrical recordings (for both the DC and O2
recordings made on the same recording computer).

Brain Slice Model of Metabolic Impairment
Previous authors have demonstrated that brain slice thickness is an
important determinant of oxidative metabolism, with impaired diffusion of
O2 in thicker slices leading to enhanced lactate accumulation and diminished mitochondrial oxidative transients in response to synaptic stimulation.24,25 We took advantage of this model to experimentally manipulate
metabolic status before the induction of SD. Figure 1 veriﬁes that
increasing slice thickness established progressive degrees of metabolic
impairment. Increasing slice thickness progressively decreased pO2,
measured at the slice surface (analysis of variance (ANOVA) Po 0.001,
Figure 1B) and increased NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence (Kruskal–Wallis
Po0.001, Figure 1C). In vivo estimates of pO2 (18.0 ± 1.926) are similar to
those we obtained at the surface of 350 and 450 μm slices (25.52 ± 11.96
and 15.25 ± 12.7 mm Hg, respectively), although pO2 values will be
decreased within the depth of the slice.27,28 The effect of slice thickness
on pO2 measured at the slice surface is noteworthy, given similar
superfusion (2 ml/minute) with carboxygenated aCSF. This ﬁnding could
best be explained by the full volume of respiring tissue acting as an O2
sink, creating an O2 gradient across the slice that extended into the
unstirred layer of aCSF.28 Consistent with this, and in agreement with prior
reports,28 during O2 probe placement, we observed a steep decrease in
pO2 on approach to the slice, even some distance away in the bath.
Consistent with other evidence that brain slice thickness inﬂuenced
metabolic status, evoked ﬁeld excitatory postsynaptic potentials (as a ratio
of presynaptic ﬁber volley) were largest in 250 μm slices and progressively
smaller in 350 and 450 μm slices (0.3 mA stimulation, 10.1 ± 3.0 versus
4.1 ± 3.3 versus 2.8 ± 0.5 (amplitudefEPSP/amplitudeﬁber volley), ANOVA

this range of slice thicknesses and metabolic states supported the initiation
and propagation of SD.

Surgical Preparation and In Vivo Recording
Non-fasted, adult (16.3 ± 7.1 weeks, 29.4 ± 6.5 g, n = 35) C57Bl/6 mice were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane (3% induction, 1% to 2% maintenance)
titrated to maintain a respiratory rate of ~ 2 Hz and burst-suppression
ﬁring. Body temperature (37.0°C ± 0.5°C) was maintained by using a
thermostatically controlled heating pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA,
USA). Because SD has been shown to cause focal hypoxia,3 mice were
supplemented with normobaric O2 (1.5 L/minute). In a subset of animals,
blood pressure was measured (83.36 ± 6.56 mm Hg, n = 17). Arterial blood
samples conﬁrmed hyperoxemia and were otherwise similar to previous
reports29 (pH 7.32 ± 0.06, pCO2 33.69 ± 10.83 mm Hg, pO2 389.21 ± 51.81
mm Hg, n = 9). Burr holes were drilled in the frontal bone (0.5 mm, at (AP,
ML) (+2.0, +1.0)) for SD induction by a drop of KCl (1 mol/L) or insertion of a
27G needle. Additional burr holes were placed in the parietal bone (1 mm,
dura removed, (−1.0, +1.0)) for electrophysiologic and adenosine measurements. In control (n = 8) and insulin-treated animals (n = 8 including
four crossed over from controls, see below), SD was induced repetitively at
30-minute intervals, or longer intervals when needed to allow full recovery
of adenosine transients or electrocorticographic activity.
In four animals undergoing SD at 30-minute intervals, hypoglycemia was
subsequently induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mU/g recombinant human insulin (Novolin R U-100, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark)
diluted 1:100 in normal saline 0.9% w/v. An additional four animals
received insulin from the start of the experiment, and as data from these
animals were consistent with the delayed treatment group, insulintreatment data were pooled (n = 8 animals). Blood glucose in tail vein
samples was tested using a clinical glucometer and test strips (ReliOn
Prime, Bentonville, AR, USA).
In another group of animals (n = 14), focal stroke was induced by distal
middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) by cauterization as described by
Kuraoka et al,30 and perfusion deﬁcits were conﬁrmed by a custom laser
speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) system. The exposed mouse skull was
illuminated by a 785 nm laser diode (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA), and backscattered 720 nm longpass-ﬁltered light was collected with a SLR camera
lens (f/3.5, 55 mm, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and digital CCD camera (Stingray
F-504B, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany). The skull was
coated with a thin ﬁlm of mineral oil to improve imaging quality. The
camera angle was orthogonal to the dorsal surface of the skull. Blood ﬂow
maps computed from LSCI were calculated and displayed in real time by
LabVIEW software modiﬁed from Bernard Choi, UCI.31 Normalized
perfusion deﬁcits were calculated ofﬂine from background-subtracted 8bit LSCI blood ﬂow maps in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), by
calculating the ratio of pixels below threshold (deﬁned as intensity 30%
contralateral) to total pixels in the hemisphere.
Electrophysiologic signals were detected by glass microelectrodes (2 to
6 MΩ) ﬁlled with saline (0.9% w/v), at a cortical depth of ~ 500 μm. Signals
were ampliﬁed (Axon Axopatch, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA),
digitized (PowerLab 8/16), and recorded in LabChart 7 (1 to 20 kHz, AD
Instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand).

Adenosine Measurements
Amperometric recordings from adenosine-sensitive enzyme-linked electrochemical probes (SBS-Ado-05-50, Sarissa Biomedical, Warwick, UK) were
made as previously described in brain slices32 and also applied to in vivo
recordings. Probe responses were linear in the range of values reported
here and for each experiment, probes were calibrated against ⩾ 2 concentrations of exogenous adenosine in physiologic buffer (aCSF in
perfusion chamber, 34°C, or phosphate-buffered saline after in vivo
measurements, 35°C to 37°C). Adenosine measurements reported here
are estimates, as concentrations at the slice surface likely differ from
interstitial levels. We note that the present estimates are ~ 10-fold lower
than values previously calculated by comparison with older frozen
stocks.16 The adenosine signal is reported as mol/L′, after the convention
of Frenguelli et al33 as it may include adenosine derived from extracellular
breakdown of ATP, and does not distinguish adenosine from its degradation products (i.e., inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine). Null probes
lacking enzymes (SBS-NUL-05-50, Sarissa Biomedical) did not generate
signals after SD (0.84 ± 1.19 mA, n = 11 SDs from four animals, Po0.001
versus uncalibrated signals from adenosine probes after SD) ruling out

contamination by swelling or from electroactive compounds such as
serotonin, catecholamines, and reactive oxygen species.
For in vivo adenosine recordings, the entire sensing surface of the probe
(500 μm length, 50 μm diameter) was inserted into the cortex. A recovery
interval of ⩾ 30 minutes was maintained between SDs throughout
experiments; therefore, a ⩾ 30 minute equilibration interval was also built
into the recording protocol before the ﬁrst experimental SD. If SD was
inadvertently induced by placement of the probe, this interval allowed any
acute effects of SD on adenosine accumulation to resolve before the start
of experiments. To address concerns that brain temperature could differ
from body temperature, we tested the enzyme-linked probes for temperature dependence, and found them minimally sensitive to temperature
differences in the 34°C to 37°C range (signals generated by adenosine were
104.9 ± 6.9% at 35.5°C, 100.0 ± 12.6% at 34°C, 88.3 ± 1.0% at 32°C, and
80.1 ± 5.4% at 30°C, expressed as % signal at 37°C). Animals were
euthanized by pentobarbital overdose to terminate experiments, and we
maintained recordings during and beyond terminal SDs. Signals from both
adenosine and null probes dropped steeply soon after pentobarbital
injection, and continued to drop during and after terminal SD. This nonspeciﬁc negative current appeared to coincide with the development of
hypotension, was unlikely to be temperature related, and was not clearly
associated with DC potential changes. Therefore, no data from SD induced
by global ischemia in vivo are reported here.

Drugs and Solutions
All salts, chemicals, and drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO, USA). Artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid was composed of (in mmol/L):
glucose 10, CaCl2 2, MgSO4 1, NaCl 126, NaHCO3 26, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.5,
and was equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, (pH 7.4). Oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD) solution was modiﬁed from aCSF by replacing glucose
with equimolar sucrose and equilibrating with 95% N2, 5% CO2. Cutting
solution was composed of (in mmol/L) sucrose 220, NaHCO3 26, glucose
10, MgSO4 6, KCl 3, NaH2PO4 1.5, CaCl2 0.2. Phosphate-buffered saline was
composed of (in mmol/L) NaCl 137, KCl 2.7, Na2HPO4 10, KH2PO4 1.8 (pH
7.4). Adenosine was prepared as a stock solution (1 mmol/L) in water and
stored at − 20 °C, and potency of frozen stock was periodically compared
against fresh solutions.

Analysis
Direct current shift duration was measured at 80% recovery. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) was quantiﬁed by methods described previously.12
Brieﬂy, signals were band-pass ﬁltered (0.5 to 40 Hz), and the integral of
the total power was computed using a 20-second decay constant. Artifacts
visually identiﬁed or marked during acquisition were excluded. Electrocorticogram depression was deﬁned as a drop in the power integral to
o50% baseline, and duration of suppression was deﬁned as time to
sustained recovery (42 minutes) of this signal to a level ⩾ 50% baseline.
Isoelectricity was deﬁned using a cut-off of 0.180 V2s (isoelectric baselines’
power integral 0.157 ± 0.003 versus non-isoelectric baselines, 0.419 ± 0.239
V2s, Po0.05, n = 5, 13 animals).
Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as the time-integrated
adenosine signal. Rarely, recordings were interrupted before adenosine
signals had decayed completely; in these cases, AUC was corrected by
linear extrapolation. This procedure was also used when clusters of SDs
occurred at short intervals such that adenosine signals had not completely
decayed before the next SD arrived. Where possible, adenosine was attributed to individual SDs; for some clusters this could not be distinguished,
and the total depolarization time/total ECoG suppression/total adenosine
accumulation were calculated for the cluster. When adenosine peaks
arrived on an elevated baseline from a previous SD, the baseline was reset
to attribute the net adenosine increase to each DC shift individually.
Values are reported as mean ± s.d. Throughout, statistical signiﬁcance
was evaluated by Student’s t-tests, ANOVA, correlation tests, and linear
regression, setting a type 1 error threshold of α = 0.05 and using Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons. Non-parametric tests (Kruskal–Wallis
ANOVA, Spearman correlation coefﬁcient) were applied to data sets with
non-Gaussian distributions (assessed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality
tests). Statistical outliers were never excluded. Rarely, data were excluded
owing to poor data quality (DC shift ambiguous or inverted, ECoG
isoelectricity, adenosine probe calibration failure). Such exclusions are
noted in relevant sections of the text. Statistics support was provided by
the Design, Biostatistics, and Ethics core component of the UNM Clinical
and Translational Science Center.

RESULTS
Baseline Metabolic Impairment Prolonged Direct Current Shifts
and Increased Spreading Depolarization-Evoked Adenosine
Accumulation
We recently described adenosine accumulation after SD in the
hippocampal CA1 region of brain slices.16 Here, we tested the
hypothesis that limiting metabolic supply would both delay
repolarization and enhance adenosine production evoked by SD.
By manipulating slice thickness, we generated a range of basal
metabolic conditions before the induction of SD (see Methods,
Figure 1): standard 350 μm slices (used in our prior reports) were
contrasted with 250 μm slices (less metabolically compromised)
and 450 μm slices (more metabolically compromised). We
conﬁrmed in this model that DC shift durations increased with
metabolic impairment (ANOVA P o 0.0001, Figures 2A and 2B),
correlating with high basal NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence (Figure 2C)
and low basal pO2 measured at the slice surface (Spearman
r = − 0.8549, P o 0.001, n = 14 slices from four animals). Consistent
with the hypothesis, adenosine accumulation was signiﬁcantly
increased with progressive metabolic compromise. In response to
SD, adenosine accumulation was barely detectable at the surface
of metabolically well-supplied slices, but as metabolic impairment
became more severe, adenosine transients were readily detected
after SD (peak, ANOVA P o0.001, Figures 2D and 2E; AUC, 0.1 ± 0.1
versus 2.8 ± 2.2 versus 8.0 ± 2.7 mmol/L′•s, ANOVA P o0.001, 250
versus 450 P o 0.001 and 350 versus 450 P o 0.01, Bonferronicorrected t-tests). After correcting for proportional increases in
tissue volume (and thus, the potential size of the adenosine pool),
there was still a signiﬁcant effect of slice thickness on adenosine
production, attributable to metabolic status (ANOVA P o 0.001,
Po 0.01 250 versus 350 and Po 0.001 250 versus 450, Bonferronicorrected multiple comparisons). Signals peaked progressively
later in more metabolically compromised slices (ANOVA P o 0.001,
n = 5, 5, 5 slices from four animals) and signals lasted progressively
longer. Thus, adenosine signals recovered to baseline (⩽10% peak)
very quickly in 250 μm slices (265.4 ± 156.5 seconds), whereas
350 μm slices recovered within the range described in our
previous report (950.3 ± 473.2 seconds); signals in 450 μm slices
persisted longer (1657.8 ± 112.2 seconds; ANOVA P o 0.0001,
all groups P o0.01 Bonferroni-corrected multiple comparisons,
n = 5, 5, 4 slices from four animals). Peak estimated adenosine
concentrations (Figure 2F) and accumulations (AUC) correlated
with basal NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence (Spearman r = 0.70, P o 0.01,
n = 15 slices from four animals). Together, these ﬁndings
suggested that adenosine accumulation depended in part on
the basal metabolic state before the onset of SD.
As noted above (Introduction), DC shift duration is one established biomarker for injurious SD.10,12 We found a positive
relationship between DC shift duration and the peak amplitude of
adenosine transients (Figure 2G), assessed over the range of
metabolic status shown in Figure 1. Total adenosine accumulation
(estimated from AUC) also correlated with DC duration (Spearman
r = 0.77, P o0.01, n = 14 slices from four animals). Together, these
results indicated that adenosine increases became substantially
larger in tissue in which repolarization was impaired or delayed by
metabolic compromise before the onset of SD.
Relationship to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (Phosphate)
Dynamics
Previous authors have established that the magnitude of the NAD
(P)H oxidative transient and ﬂux through oxidative respiration
(measured by changes in O2 tension) correlate with the metabolic
demand placed on the tissue.23,27,28 We compared our observations of adenosine accumulation with O2 utilization and the
oxidative transient of NAD(P)H during SD, across the range of
different baseline conditions established in Figure 1.
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1779 – 1790

During SD, decreases in O2 tension and oxidative transients in
NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence were largest in slices with high O2
availability, and were progressively smaller in relatively more
hypoxic slices (NAD(P)H ANOVA P o0.0001, pO2 ANOVA P o 0.001,
Figures 3A–C). pO2 decreases correlated with NAD(P)H oxidative
transients (Spearman r = 0.8549, P o0.001) as expected for
mitochondrial NADH signals. After SD, the peak adenosine signals
measured at the slice surface were negatively correlated with the
magnitude of NAD(P)H oxidative transients (Figure 3D). In
agreement with prior work,25,34 the duration of the oxidative
transient was longest in high O2 conditions, and considerably
shorter in slices with more limited oxygen availability (14.2 ± 5.1
versus 6.1 ± 1.6 versus 5.6 ± 1.6 seconds, 250 versus 350 versus
450 μm, ANOVA P o 0.0001; 250 versus 350 Po 0.001 and 250
versus 450 P o 0.0001, Bonferroni-corrected t-tests, n = 10, 10, 7
slices from eight animals).
The amplitudes of overshooting autoﬂuorescence increases
(Figure 3A) were largest in brain slices with high basal pO2 (dF/F0
13.3 ± 5.6 versus 8.2 ± 5.1 versus 7.7 ± 2.8%, 250 versus 350 versus
450, ANOVA P o0.05, P o 0.05 Bonferroni-corrected t-tests 250
versus 350 and 250 versus 450, n = 11, 10, 8 slices from eight
animals). This observation contrasts with prior reports of increased
overshoot amplitudes in relative hypoxia.3,27 In the current study,
amplitudes of overshoots in 450 μm slices may have been partly
limited by a ceiling effect on NAD(P)H signal increases (see below).
Another factor that likely contributes to the apparent discrepancy
is contamination by profound swelling-related intrinsic optical
changes that occur after SD, and that can be inﬂuenced markedly
by the optical recording conﬁguration (submersion versus interface chambers). Thus, we did not further interpret overshooting
autoﬂuorescence increases after SD in the present study.
Direct current shifts correlated with NAD(P)H oxidative transients (Spearman r = 0.6882, P o0.0001, n = 29 slices from eight
animals), although the relationship was signiﬁcantly nonlinear
(P o 0.01, runs test) and better ﬁt by a ﬁrst-order exponential than
by linear regression (P o 0.05). This pattern could be explained by
a ceiling effect, such that under hypoxic conditions when NAD(P)H
oxidative transients approached zero, DC durations continued to
increase owing to the unmet metabolic demand. Consistent with
this interpretation, the NAD(P)H response to hypoxia was
signiﬁcantly blunted in 450 μm slices (maximum dF/F0 after 20minute hypoxia exposure 26.7 ± 7.6 versus 27.1 ± 5.6 versus
14.7 ± 3.7%, 250 versus 350 versus 450 μm, P o0.01 ANOVA,
n = 6,6,6 slices from two animals). By contrast with NAD(P)H
signals, the relationship between adenosine and DC shift duration
was linear throughout the range (P = 0.29, runs test) and better ﬁt
by linear regression than by an exponential function. These
ﬁndings suggested that compared with NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence
changes, adenosine signals were better able to distinguish severe
metabolic compromise resulting from SD in hypoxic conditions.
As noted above, our data were consistent with the model that
adenosine accumulation resulting from SD was modiﬁed by basal
metabolic status, but might be confounded by the larger volume
of tissue in thick brain slices. Therefore, we tested whether varying
metabolic status in slices of ﬁxed thickness would have a similar
effect on SD-associated adenosine transients. Figure 4 shows that
reducing basal O2 availability to physiologic values28 was sufﬁcient
to amplify adenosine signals after SD in 250 μm slices. Equilibrating aCSF with 21% rather than 95% O2 signiﬁcantly reduced pO2
at the slice surface (30.9 ± 25.2 versus 189.8 ± 42.9 mm Hg, paired
t-test P = 0.0001, n = 6 slices from three animals) and increased
NAD(P)H autoﬂuorescence (225.5 ± 47.9 versus 193.8 ± 43.6
counts, paired t-test P o 0.001, n = 5 slices from three animals),
without itself increasing adenosine to detectable levels. In 21% O2
conditions, SD-evoked adenosine transients were easily detected
from 250 μm slices, with accumulations approximately fourfold
larger than in 95% O2 conditions (Figures 4A and 4B), and
adenosine signals were more dramatically increased in the same

without tissue volume as an experimental variable.

detected from cortex than from hippocampal CA1 (P o 0.05,
n = 5,5 slices from two animals), likely because the area of
depolarized tissue was larger.16
Adenosine Accumulation was Observed After SD In Vivo and
Correlated with Direct Current Duration
Figure 5 shows that transient accumulation of adenosine was
detected with SD in vivo. Figure 5D shows representative traces in
one animal. The peak estimated adenosine concentration reached
25.9 ± 35.6 μmol/L′ (range 4.3 to 58.5 μmol/L′) (n = 14 SDs from
eight animals) and all peaks occurred after DC shifts; and under
these conditions, adenosine peaks were never seen without a
conﬁrmed SD. Adenosine transients decayed slowly over several
minutes, returning to within 10% of baseline at 24.7 ± 17.2
minutes. Events associated with adenosine accumulation were
typical SDs. Direct current shift duration averaged 69.3 ± 35.9
seconds (n = 14 SDs from eight animals). Propagation rate,
estimated from LSCI, was 3.5 ± 2.6 mm/minute (n = 3 SDs from
two animals). The magnitudes of peak amplitudes of adenosine
transients, as well as areas under the curve (AUC) each correlated
© 2014 ISCBFM

with DC durations (peak, Spearman r = 0.71, P o0.01; AUC,
Figure 5B), similar to ﬁndings in brain slice studies (Figure 3).
For the experiments in Figure 5, we induced SD in the otherwise
healthy neocortex of anesthetized adult C57Bl/6 mice. As others
have reported hypoxic domains associated with SD,3 and hypoxia
is known to be a potent stimulus for adenosine release,14 we
provided supplemental O2 to maintain arterial hyperoxemia
4300 mm Hg throughout all in vivo experiments (see Materials
and Methods). This allowed us to determine that SD itself,
regardless of confounding effects of any associated hypoxia, could
trigger adenosine accumulation.
In Vivo Adenosine Accumulation was more Pronounced when
Metabolism was Impaired by Hypoglycemia or Ischemia
To evaluate the role of metabolic supply on adenosine accumulation after SD in vivo, we impaired metabolic status with
insulin-induced hypoglycemia or with focal ischemia induced
by dMCAO.
Hypoglycemia was induced by insulin injection (1.5 mU/g,
intraperitioneally) in anesthetized mice while generating and
recording SD and measuring associated adenosine signals from

the cortex. As previously described by other authors,35,36 DC shifts
were prolonged under hypoglycemic conditions (Kruskal–Wallis
Po 0.001, Figures 5C and 5E). Adenosine accumulation showed a
signiﬁcant positive correlation with DC shift duration in insulintreated animals (Spearman r = 0.4545, P o 0.05, n = 21 SDs from
ﬁve animals).
In insulin-treated animals, adenosine transients reached peaks
comparable to those seen in untreated animals (26.2 ± 14.2 μmol/L′;
range: (3.5 to 45.2 μmol/L′)). Interestingly, the effect of serum
blood glucose concentration on DC duration was nonlinear, and
was better ﬁt by a ﬁrst -order exponential than by linear regression
(P o 0.05). That is, DC shifts remained short even well below the
physiologic range of systemic glucose concentrations, and did not
become obviously prolonged until glucose fell below 40 to 45 mg/
dL, or around the threshold of clinical neuroglycopenia.37 In two
out of eight insulin-treated animals, SDs occurred spontaneously
(at blood glucose levels of 22 and 28 mg/dL), consistent with prior
investigations of severe hypoglycemia.38 Severe hypoglycemia
alone was a poor predictor of adenosine accumulation resulting
from SD (AUC 16.91 ± 13.31 versus 16.37 ± 20.27 mmol/L′•s,
glucose o 40 versus ⩾ 40 mg/dL, P = 0.9318). Rather, only those
hypoglycemic SDs that also had prolonged DC shifts generated
larger adenosine signals.

We induced focal ischemia by occlusion of the distal middle
cerebral artery following previously described procedures,30 then
recorded adenosine and electrophysiologic signals from burr holes
placed adjacent to the predicted dMCAO core and monitored
relative cerebral blood ﬂow using LSCI (Figure 6A). We observed
spontaneous SDs in 8 out of 14 animals with dMCAO (latency to
ﬁrst periinfarct depolarization, 136.0 ± 132.1 minutes, range 7 to
354 minutes; Figure 6B). Each SD that was conﬁrmed by a clear DC
shift was accompanied by a readily resolvable, transient increase
in adenosine signal (Figure 6D, n = 15 SDs from eight animals) and
these reached an average of 22.5 ± 11.2 μmol/L′ (range: 4.7 to
47.3 μmol/L′). As ischemia progressed, DC shifts tended to become
more prolonged and adenosine signals increased (Figures 6C and
6D). Adenosine accumulation correlated with DC durations of
spontaneous SDs in dMCAO animals (peak, Spearman r = 0.6182,
Po 0.01, n = 18 SDs from eight animals). Compared with other
reports of dMCAO, the delay and/or prevention of SD in some of
our animals was likely related to the use of isoﬂurane as
anesthetic39 and the intentionally elevated arterial O2 content.29
Twenty-eight SDs in 74.4 recording hours were detected by LSCI
transients, and of these, 21 SDs were conﬁrmed by DC shifts. Laser
speckle contrast imaging detected seven SDs that did not
propagate through the DC recording site, likely owing to the

DISCUSSION
The major new ﬁndings of this study were that (1) SD in vivo
generated robust adenosine transients in otherwise healthy mice,
(2) adenosine signals associated with focal stroke were pulsatile
and intimately linked to SDs, and (3) adenosine signals triggered
by SD could reliably report underlying metabolic status in brain
slices and in vivo, and compared favorably with other established
measures of metabolic demand including DC shift durations, NAD
(P)H and O2 signals, and electrocorticographic depression. These
ﬁndings suggested that adenosine could be used as a biomarker
or adjunct modality to detect SD-associated metabolic demand in
excess of available substrate (i.e., glucose and oxygen), in tissue
vulnerable to injury. Adenosine accumulation may also be
implicated in functional consequences of SD including effects
on blood–brain barrier permeability, neuroinﬂammation, synaptic
transmission, and vascular tone.

inadvertent positioning of electrode in infarcted or otherwise
damaged tissue. Electrophysiologic signals from six additional SDs
in dMCAO animals were excluded from further analysis because
DC deﬂections were ambiguous or too small to measure reliably.
Perfusion deﬁcits resulting in SDs were not signiﬁcantly larger
than perfusion deﬁcits failing to elicit SDs (9.3 ± 5.4% versus
7.7 ± 4.7%, P = 0.55, n = 8, 6 animals) and no dose–effect relationship was detected between perfusion deﬁcits and number of SDs
(P = 0.5066, n = 14 animals). We evaluated signals for indications of
gradual adenosine accumulation before the onset of the ﬁrst SD,
and between events. A rising adenosine baseline was brieﬂy seen
(for ~ 40 minutes) in only 1 out of 14 dMCAO animals (with a slope
of 6.74 nmol/L′ per second), after an ambiguous DC signal.
Otherwise, adenosine transients were not seen before SD, in
intervals between SDs, or in animals without SDs (P o 0.001,
maximum peak-to-trough adenosine amplitude from dMCAO
animals without SD compared with signals recorded in animals
immediately after SD). Isoelectricity was observed at the onset of
recording in 3 of 14 dMCAO animals, and could indicate these
recordings were made from the belt of normally perfused yet
electrocorticographically depressed tissue surrounding ischemic
lesions,40 or that an undetected spreading depression or nonspreading depression (possibly mediated by adenosine41) may
have occurred before recording.
Considering all SD-associated adenosine measurements together,
whether from untreated, hypoglycemic, or infarcted animals, a
correlation was seen between DC durations and adenosine
accumulation (peak Spearman r = 0.5092, Po 0.0001, n = 54 SDs
from 17 animals; AUC Spearman r = 0.5209, P o 0.0001, n = 56 SDs
from 20 animals). The resolution of electrocorticographic (ECoG)
depression has also been interpreted to be an indirect indicator of
metabolic recovery after SD.12 Consistent with this, a relationship
was observed between adenosine accumulation and ECoG
suppression, for each data set alone (normoglycemia, hypoglycemia, dMCAO, Figure 7) and for all-cause SD considered together
(Spearman r = 0.5797, P o 0.001, n = 37 non-isoelectric SDs from 18
animals). This relationship might also have been predicted from
results presented above, as adenosine accumulation was seen to
correlate with DC shift duration, and DC shift duration has
previously been shown to correlate with ECoG depression in nonisoelectric SDs.12 The latter relationship was also detected in the
present data set (Spearman r = 0.3045, P o0.05, n = 43 SDs from 17
animals).
Thus, in vivo studies under conditions of metabolic compromise
conﬁrmed the relationship between DC shift duration and
adenosine accumulation and revealed a striking pattern of
adenosine signals associated with stroke-induced SDs rather than
ischemia per se.

also showed this relationship (untreated: R2 = 0.9381, P o0.0001,

artery occlusion animals: (r = 0.7167, Po 0.05, n = 9 SDs from six

Adenosine Accumulation in Brain Slices is a Marker of Severe
Metabolic Burden of Spreading Depolarization
As discussed in the Introduction, extracellular adenosine is sensitive to small changes in intracellular ATP concentration. Here, we
found that in addition to being quite sensitive, adenosine signals
correlated with unmet metabolic demand across a wide dynamic
range as compared with other signals.
Our results (Figures 1–4) indicated that adenosine increases
became substantially larger in tissue that was metabolically
compromised before the onset of SD, supporting the hypothesis
that energy demand in excess of supply during SD is a major
source of this signal. Our adenosine signals were similar to others
with amperometric probes in brain slices undergoing K+-induced
depolarization (~10 μmol/L42) and OGD-induced SD33 and were in
line with in vitro estimates based on pharmacology during
intermittent OGD (~30 μmol/L).43 Our in vitro ﬁndings further
suggested that extracellular adenosine could serve as a surrogate
marker of DC shift duration.
Approaches to explicitly assess the metabolic burden of SD in
brain slices have included NADH autoﬂuorescence and O2
measurements, among others.23,27 As a measure of metabolic
responses to SD, adenosine was better than NAD(P)H dynamics in
compromised tissue (Results, Figure 3), in that NAD(P)H signal
dynamics approached a ceiling as hypoxia became more extreme,
whereas adenosine could still distinguish degrees of DC shift
prolongation. O2 signals similarly approached a ﬂoor effect,
whereas adenosine signals increased linearly across the range of
metabolic status tested.

Graded Spreading Depolarization-Induced Adenosine Release was
Observed In Vivo
We observed adenosine accumulation time-locked to SD in vivo
(Figure 5). The peak adenosine concentrations we estimated were
higher than those previously reported by microdialysis in a study
where EEG depression was used to detect SD (~300 nmol/L20). Our
ﬁndings support the conclusion of this prior study, that adenosine
accumulation was a consequence of SD; and it is likely that
pooling samples across several minutes in the microdialysis study
may have led to underestimation of peak values. Our values are on
the order of those reported in another microdialysis study of
adenosine in a ﬂuid percussion model of traumatic brain injury
(6 μmol/L),19 in which SD likely occurred, although its occurrence
was not monitored. At the concentrations estimated here,
adenosine might be expected to activate all subtypes of P1
receptors, including A1, A2A, and A2B and A3 receptors. Such
receptor activation could have broad implications for electrocortical suppression, blood–brain barrier permeabilization, vascular reactivity, thermoregulation, and neuroinﬂammation after SD.13
All these targets, individually or in combination could contribute
to neuroprotection or neurotoxicity in different disease contexts.
In addition, adenosine increases could be detected even during
DC shifts, raising the possibility that adenosine could modify
transmitter release or excitability even during the passage/
propagation of SD events.
In general, in vivo ﬁndings (Figures 5–7) built upon our
conclusions from brain slice studies16 (Figures 1–4) that SD led
to accumulation of adenosine in a physiologically relevant range,
even in the context of intact neurovascular coupling (Figure 5).
Although the adenosine signals we detected by amperometric
probes were speciﬁc to SD, studies in brain slices suggested that
providing tissue with supraphysiologic availability of substrate and
O2 could limit adenosine accumulation below detectable levels
(Figure 2). Thus, while adenosine signals from amperometric
probes were speciﬁc to SD, they were not sufﬁciently sensitive to
detect small adenosine releases associated with SD under conditions of supraphysiologic metabolic supply. As a stand-alone
screening tool, adenosine would likely carry a low false-positive
rate and a relatively higher false-negative rate. The SDs missed by
adenosine would be those carrying the lowest pathologic risk.
Clinical research protocols have generally measured DC shift
duration and ECoG suppression as markers of the metabolic
impact of SD, and thus required direct electrical access to the
cortical surface. However, recent work has revealed a metabolic
signature of SD, including decreased glucose and elevated lactate/
pyruvate ratio in patient microdialysate samples.6,44 Our ﬁndings
build on this prior work, and suggest that adenosine may be a
useful adjunct biomarker for SD and in some cases, may be more
sensitive to subtle disturbances in metabolism after SD.
Recapitulating ﬁndings from our slice studies, the total accumulation in response to SD in vivo was graded, increasing linearly
with the duration of the DC shift when tested under conditions of
progressive metabolic compromise (Figures 3 and 5). Electrical
features of SD (DC shift duration and prolonged electrocorticographic (ECoG) suppression) have previously been used as
markers of metabolic impairment,12,45 and it is known that tissue
undergoing SD on a background of ECoG suppression (so-called
‘isoelectric SD’) has a poor prognosis. Here, adenosine accumulation correlated with both DC shift durations and ECoG suppression
(Figures 5 and 7), and could therefore be useful as a proxy marker
of vulnerable tissue undergoing SD. Compared with ECoG suppression, adenosine has the added beneﬁt of providing information about metabolic recovery in isoelectric tissue.
Consistent with prior reports, we observed that DC shifts
became prolonged as systemic blood glucose approached neuroglycopenic levels (o 40 mg/dL, Figure 5). The observation that
hypoglycemia prolongs DC shift durations is well established.35,36

Presumably, substrate deﬁciency limits energy production below
that required for [K+]o clearance by Na+/K+ATPase and thus delays
cellular repolarization.38 Previous authors have demonstrated that
SD itself depletes glucose levels, which require 25 to 30 minutes to
recover.4 This time course closely matches the period of metabolic
recovery marked here by adenosine elevation. Thus, these metabolic signals are concordant, and our data support the conclusion
that there is a vulnerable period marked by metabolic depletion
after SD.4 We suggest that, like glucose, adenosine signals appear
to be sensitive to deteriorations of energy status in compromised
tissue, and could serve as a useful prognostic marker under certain
conditions.
Adenosine in Stroke Linked to Spreading Depolarizations
We observed adenosine peaks in association with depolarizations
around the perimeter of focal strokes (Figure 6). Adenosine transients in periinfarct regions almost always followed the occurrence
of SDs, recovering to baseline during quiescent intervals. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of this pattern of pulsatile
adenosine accumulation in stroke. The maximum adenosine levels
associated with SDs in the ischemic penumbra, estimated here,
were higher than concentrations reported on the basis of
microdialysis in the striatum at speciﬁc time points after ﬁlament
MCAO (2.7 μmol/L18), and in the cortex during global ischemia
(3.5 μmol/L17). This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that
we measured continuously at a relatively high sampling rate
(1 kHz) rather than pooling samples from tens of minutes, and
thus were able to detect transient peaks. Because the latency to
SD varies from animal to animal (Figure 6B), and because accumulation is transient, an analysis scheme that aligned measurements
by occlusion time would have averaged samples obtained during
SD with those from quiescent periods, yielding a lower estimate of
adenosine concentration and contributing to variability.
Although we did not report on adenosine signals within the
ischemic core, it seems likely from brain slice studies of OGD that
the initial adenosine release is linked to SD.33 Importantly, our
recordings do not provide information on basal adenosine concentrations, and cannot rule out the possibility that values were
elevated at baseline, or that an adenosine gradient existed across
the ischemic penumbra. Such basal adenosine tone, if present,
could mitigate the inverse neurovascular coupling and long DC
shifts characterizing SD in periinfarct regions46,47 and would be
expected to inhibit seizure activity.15 In addition, we acknowledge
that O2 supplementation provided in our studies may have improved
metabolic status, in those regions with preserved residual blood
ﬂow. However, these continuous adenosine recordings were made
from the beginning of acute strokes and continued for up to
8 hours, and no progressive increases in baseline were observed.
A model in which adenosine gradually accumulates owing to
progressive metabolic impairment in the penumbra, or owing to
diffusion from the ischemic core, was not supported by the
pattern we observed, although it is possible that isoelectricity in
the periinfarct region was mediated in part by adenosine
accumulation below our threshold of detection.40,41 We instead
suggest that the bulk of adenosine released in stroke is pulsatile
and linked to occurrence of SDs and not to gradual deterioration
of metabolic status. If this is true, it follows that the more
adenosine accumulation is observed, the more SDs (or the worse
the SDs) may be inferred to be occurring. Prior work has shown
that adenosine levels strongly predict neurologic impairment and
lesion size after ischemia;48 together with other foundational data
on SD,10,11 the current ﬁndings suggest that adenosine signals
indicate the number or severity of SDs, whereas the SDs themselves likely have a causal role in consolidation and expansion of
ischemic lesions.
Our ﬁndings suggested that adenosine (or its derivatives) might
serve as useful biomarkers of SD in injured brain. Although

speculative, the incorporation of adenosine-sensitive probes into
ventricular drains or central line catheters could enable detection
of brain-derived adenosine in cerebrospinal ﬂuid or plasma in
patients without craniotomy, as a means to estimate SD burden.
Indeed, adenosine is elevated in the peripheral blood of patients
recovering from transient ischemic attacks and stroke.49 Adenosine’s short half-life (~300 ms in plasma) may allow individual
events to be resolved. However, uric acid (the stable end-product
of adenosine degradation in humans),13 may better report the
cumulative severity of SD, and can be detected noninvasively in
urine or serum.
