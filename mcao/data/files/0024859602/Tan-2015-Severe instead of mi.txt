were rendered with mild hyperglycemia (9.43 ± 1.39–

of mild hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury and inhibits stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis by a mechanism
involving suppression of CREB and BDNF signaling.

Abstract—Accumulated evidence suggests that enhanced
neurogenesis stimulated by ischemic injury contributes to
stroke outcome. However, it is unclear whether hyperglycemia, which is frequently tested positive in patients with
acute ischemic stroke, inﬂuences stroke-induced neurogenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the eﬀect of
hyperglycemia on stroke-induced neurogenesis in a rat
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. For this purpose,
adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (220–250 g) were subjected
to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Glucose was administered during ischemia to produce target blood levels ranging from 4.83 ± 0.94 mM (normoglycemia) to 20.76 ± 1.56 mM. To label proliferating cells in
ischemic ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) of lateral ventricles, 50 -bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 24 h
after MCAO. Brains were harvested 2 h post-BrdU to evaluate the eﬀects of hyperglycemia on infarct volume and
SVZ cell proliferation. Rats that were severely hyperglycemic (19.26 ± 1.48 mM to 20.76 ± 1.56 mM) during
ischemia had 24.26% increase in infarct volume (P < 0.05)
and more serious neurological function deﬁcits (P < 0.05).
The severe hyperglycemic rats also showed dramatically
decreased proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells
(NSPCs) (P < 0.05) and down-regulation of the phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein

INTRODUCTION
Stroke, which has exceeded heart disease to become the
leading cause of death and adult disability in china, is a
serious and debilitating neurological disease with
ischemic stroke being the most common form (Liu et al.,
2011). Relief of the damage of pre-existing neurons and
generation of new neurons in the injured brain are
believed to be crucial to functional restoration after
ischemic insult onset. To date a wealth of studies has
demonstrated the existence of neural stem/progenitor
cells (NSPCs) capable of self-renewal and multipotency
in the adult central nervous systems of rodents
(Reynolds and Weiss, 1992) and humans (Eriksson
et al., 1998), restricted in two speciﬁc ‘‘neurogenic
niches’’, subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LV) and subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate
gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. New neurons generated
from SVZ normally migrate via the rostral migratory
stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb to integrate as granule
cells and periglomerular interneurons into the olfactory
circuit (Gage, 2000). However, diﬀering from normal circumstances, pathological conditions such as cerebral
ischemia could stimulate neurogenesis in SVZ and directed migration of newly formed neural progenitor cells
toward the infarct area (Jin et al., 2001; Zhang et al.,
2001; Yamashita et al., 2006). Furthermore, such injuryinduced neurogenesis is supposed to contribute to stroke
outcome (Raber et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2010; Sun et al.,
2012, 2013, 2015; Wang et al., 2012). There is therefore
an urgent need for a better understanding of injuryinduced neurogenesis in adult mammals. To our knowledge, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is sharply

reduced in type 1 and type 2 diabetic models (JacksonGuilford et al., 2000; Beauquis et al., 2006, 2008; Zhang
et al., 2008; Lang et al., 2009; Ramos-Rodriguez et al.,
2014), which suggested a potential role of blood glucose
in self-renewal and proliferation of NSPCs.
Clinical studies indicated that 40–70% of acute stroke
patients had blood glucose >6.1 mM at admission
(Capes et al., 2001; Dave et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2012;
Desilles et al., 2013) and post-stroke hyperglycemia independently correlated with poor clinical outcome (Kruyt
et al., 2010; Arnold et al., 2014). We reported previously
that high glucose could induce apoptosis and suppress
proliferation of immortalized adult rat neural stem cells
subjected to 6 h oxygen and glucose deprivation (Chen
et al., 2013). However whether elevated blood glucose
negatively inﬂuenced post-stroke neurogenesis in vivo
and to what extent still remain unknown.
Cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein
(CREB) is a nuclear-localized basic leucine zipper
superfamily transcription factor and activated by its
phosphorylation on Ser133. Phospho-CREB (p-CREB)
is at the hub of multiple cell-signaling cascades and
regulates the expression of several downstream target
genes essential for NSPCs proliferation, survival and
diﬀerentiation such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) (Dworkin et al., 2009; Grimm et al., 2009;
Mantamadiotis et al., 2012). It has been well documented
that cerebral ischemia could trigger robust phosphorylation of CREB which is considered to be implicated in
stroke-induced neurogenesis (Kitagawa, 2007; Tanaka
et al., 2010).
In the present study, we examined the eﬀect of
hyperglycemia on neurogenesis in SVZ using a rat
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia and further
explored whether CREB signaling pathway is involved in
the mechanism by which hyperglycemia aﬀects strokeinduced neurogenesis.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal model
All studies were performed on adult male Sprague–
Dawley rats (220–250 g) obtained from Experimental
Animal Center of Southern Medical University. The
animals were housed at 24 °C and maintained on a 12-h
light/dark cycle (lights on 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) with
free access to food and water. All experiments were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Regulation of the
Southern Medical University and conducted in
accordance with the the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publications No. 80–23). Cerebral ischemia was
generated by a 90-min intraluminal occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) with reperfusion as
described originally by Longa et al. (1989). Before surgical procedures, rats were fasted overnight to ensure uniform basal blood glucose levels. Anesthesia was induced
by intraperitoneal injection (IP) of 3% pentobarbital
sodium (0.2 ml/kg). Then, the right cervical carotid bifurcation was exposed via a ventral midline cervical incision.
Two branches of the external carotid artery (ECA), the

139

occipital artery and superior thyroid artery, were carefully
isolated and cut oﬀ. A 4-cm long 3–0 monoﬁlament nylon
suture with a thin silicon coat was introduced into the right
internal carotid artery (ICA) through a micro-incision made
on the ECA and was advanced 21–22 mm from the carotid bifurcation. Ninety minutes after occlusion, the ﬁlament
was withdrawn for reperfusion. Body temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with a heating pad. Shamoperated rats underwent the same surgical procedure
without suture insertion.
Induction of acute hyperglycemia
Rats were rendered hyperglycemic with IP injection of
dextrose (Sigma; 50%) at 5 min after MCAO and
another two indicated time points with a 45-min interval
(Fig. 1A). The initial injection volume was 2.5 or
8.0 ml/kg for the target blood glucose concentrations of
10 and 20 mM, respectively. Subsequent injection
volumes were all 2.0 ml/kg. Normoglycemic and sham
groups received 2.0 ml/kg saline vehicle at the three
time points. Tail blood was obtained at four indicated
time points to measure glucose levels (Optium Xceed
Glucometer, Abbott). Since an increased mortality rate
(36%) was observed in 20 mM glucose group in our
preliminary experiment (data not shown), we had to
raise the number of rats in that group to ensure at least
5 rats used to analyze at each time point.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Rats were decapitated 24 h after the onset of ischemia
(n = 5 each group). Brains were removed rapidly and a
total of six 2-mm-thick coronal sections for every rat
were serially cut throughout the brain using a rodent
brain matrix, then immersed in 2% TTC (Sigma) in
saline for 12 min at 37 °C. The stained sections were
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and photographed by a
scanner. Infarct area, left hemisphere area, and total
brain areas were measured by a blinded investigator
using Image J software. As previously described
(Bederson et al., 1986; Swanson et al., 1990), infarct volume was expressed as the percentage of the volume of
the contralateral hemisphere.
Behavioral testing
Each rat was subjected to a battery of behavioral tests,
which consisted of Modiﬁed Neurological Severity Score
(mNSS) and rotarod motor test, to evaluate neurologic
function both before and 24 h after MCAO (n = 6 each
group).
mNSS. The score system is composite of motor
(muscle status, abnormal movement), sensory (visual,
tactile, and proprioceptive), and reﬂex tests (De Ryck
et al., 1989; Li et al., 2000, 2001). Neurological function
was graded on a scale of 0–14 (normal score, 0; mild
injury, 1–4; moderate impairment, 5–9; severe deﬁcit
score, 10–14). In the severity scores of injury, one point
is awarded for the inability to correctly perform the tasks
or for the lack of a tested reﬂex.

Rotarod test. An accelerating rotarod (Harvard
Apparatus) provides an index of fore and hindlimb motor
coordination and balance. The rats were trained on an
accelerating (from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min) rotating
cylinder (rotarod) for 3 days before MCAO to obtain
stable baseline values (in seconds). Test sessions
including three trials were performed just before MCAO
and at 24 h after cerebral ischemia by an observer who
was blinded to the experimental groups. A trial ended if
the animal fell oﬀ the rungs or gripped the device and
spun around for two consecutive revolutions without
attempting to walk on the rungs and the time the
animals maintained on the rotarod was recorded. Motor
test data were presented as percentage of mean
duration (three trials) on the rotarod compared with the
internal baseline control (before surgery) (Chen et al.,
2000; Li et al., 2000).

Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The sections were
incubated in the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and
binding to the antibody was detected by incubation with
Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution,
1:500; Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at room
temperature. For BrdU immunoﬂuorescence, brain
sections were pretreated with 2 N HCl at 37 °C for 30 min
and then neutralized with boric acid (PH 8.5) before
blocking. Fluorescence signals were detected with a laser
confocal
microscope
(TSC
SP2,
Leica)
at
excitation/emission wavelengths of 590 nm/617 nm
(Alexa FluorÒ 594, red) and at 470 nm/505 nm (Alexa
FluorÒ 488, green). The sections incubated with PBS
instead of the primary antibodies were taken as negative
controls. Image Pro Plus version 6.0 was employed to
analyze acquired images. (n = 5–6 each group).

BrdU administration

Western blotting

50 -Bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), which is substitute for thymidine to integrate
into the DNA of dividing cells during the S-phase, was
used to label proliferating cells. BrdU is a ‘gold standard’
by which all other markers in neurogenesis research are
measured (Wojtowicz and Kee, 2006). Rats received a single injection of BrdU (300 mg/kg in saline) 24 h after
MCAO. This dose was applied according to previous study
validating maximal labeling at 300 mg/kg (Cameron and
McKay, 2001). Animals were sacriﬁced two hours postBrdU and perfused transcardially with 4%paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) following
normal saline. Brains were isolated, and ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight. 40-lm-thick coronal
sections were serially cut from post-ﬁxed brains
(bregma + 1.2  bregma  0.3 mm) using a cryostat
microtome and stored at 80 °C.

To investigate protein expression levels of p-CREB and
BDNF in ischemic ipsilateral SVZ, animals were
euthanatized 6, 12 and 24 h after MCAO (n = 5–6 each
group). The SVZ was dissected from brains and
homogenized in cold protein lysis buﬀer containing 1%
Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM
TrisHCl (pH 8.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0),
1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM sodium ﬂuoride, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 20 mM Na4P2O7,10% glycerol,
and proteinase Inhibitor cocktail. Subsequent to
extraction, supernatant was collected following
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein
(50 lg, determined using a BCA assay) was boiled at
100 °C in SDS sample buﬀer for 5 min, electrophoresed
on SDS–PAGE gels, and transferred to PVDF
membranes, which were incubated overnight at 4 °C
with primary antibody against total-CREB (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), phosphoCREB (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA), BDNF (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), b-actin (1:500; Oncogene
Science, Cambridge, MA, USA). Thereafter, membranes
were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized
using
a
chemiluminescence
detection
system
(Amersham ECL reagents, GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK)

Immunohistochemistry
The following primary antibodies were used in present
study: mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (2 lg/ml; Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA), goat polyclonal anti-Doublecortin
(DCX; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), mouse monoclonal anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic
Protein (GFAP, a maker of astrocytes; 1:200; Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit monoclonal antiPhospho-CREB antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling

Hercules, CA, USA).

to label proliferating and dividing cells. As Fig. 3A
illustrated, BrdU labeling in the SVZ was discretely
localized to a narrow band adjacent to the ventricle.
Compared with the sham group, an increased number
of BrdU-labeled cells in the ischemic ipsilateral SVZ was
observed
in
postischemic
normoglycemic
rats
(P < 0.01, Fig. 3A, B). Nevertheless there were
signiﬁcantly fewer BrdU-labeled cells in the ipsilateral
SVZ of 20 mM group than in normoglycemic rats
(P < 0.01, Fig. 3B). No remarkable distinction of BrdUlabeled cells in the 10 mM group and the
normoglycemic group existed (P = 0.293, Fig. 3B).

Cell counts
Deﬁned regions of interest (ROI) within the dorsolateral
SVZ, which has been delineated as previous study
(Brazel et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2013), were counted
by a blind manner. A total of 5–7 coronal sections
(200 lm apart) per animal were investigated. A twophoton confocal microscope was employed to count
double-labeled cells.

Hyperglycemia suppressed neurogenesis via downregulation of CREB phosphorylation level

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
18.0 software. Potential diﬀerences between the mean
values were assessed using a one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey test for post hoc comparisons when
equal variances were assumed. P-value less than 0.05
denoted a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

DCX as a reliable and speciﬁc marker was widely used to
evaluate levels of adult neurogenesis and its modulation
(Couillard-Despres et al., 2005). In the SVZ, more cells
were labeled ipsilateral to ischemia in rats subjected to
MCAO than the sham group (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A, C). But
DCX-positive cells dramatically decreased in rats that
sustained a 20 mM blood glucose level compared with
normoglycemic rats (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A, C). Instead, there
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence of post-stroke neurogenesis
between the 10 mM group and normoglycemic controls
(P = 0.131, Fig. 3C). In order to determine the DCXpositive cells that originated from newly generated cells,
we performed double immunostaining with antibodies to
BrdU and DCX. The number of BrdU/DCX coexpressing
cells in the ipsilateral SVZ was notably lower in the
20 mM group than the normoglycemic group, indicating
an impairment in post-stroke neurogenesis under severe
hyperglycemia (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A, D). In parallel with single labeling, no signiﬁcant disparity of BrdU/DCX doublelabeled cells was found between 10 mM and the normoglycemic group (P = 0.125, Fig. 3A, D).
We further explored the eﬀect of hyperglycemia on
activation of CREB in NSCPs located in ischemic
ipsilateral SVZ, using double labeling with DCX and pCREB antibodies. Fig. 4A, B suggested an enhanced
phosphorylation of CREB in NSCPs after ischemic
insult. However, the amount of DCX/p-CREB
coexpressing cells strikingly decreased in the 20 mM
group than the normoglycemic group (P < 0.01,
Fig. 4B). In addition, we failed to conﬁrm a signiﬁcant
discrimination in activation magnitude of CREB between
10 mM and the normoglycemic group (P = 0.72,
Fig. 4B). Taken together, our data indicated that
ischemic injury-induced phosphorylation of CREB is
suppressed by severe instead of mild hyperglycemia.

RESULTS
Hyperglycemia increased infarct size and
exacerbated neurological functional outcome
Hyperglycemia was induced by intraperitoneal glucose
injections during ischemia (see Fig. 1B, Table 1).
Quantitative assessment of infarct size, as determined
by TTC staining, showed a signiﬁcant expansion in rats
maintained at 20 mM glucose during ischemia compared
with the normoglycemic group (Fig. 2A, B). Likewise,
postischemic functional deﬁcits, measured by modiﬁed
Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) and Rotarod, were
worse in the 20 mM group than normoglycemic rats
(Fig. 2C, D). However, the mNSS and Rotarod score
were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the 10 mM
group and the normoglycemic group (P = 0.184 and
0.185, respectively). Even though no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence of infarct size between the 10 mM group and
the normoglycemic group was detected (Fig. 2A, B), a
trend toward a larger infarct volume in 10 mM glucose
group was noticed (P = 0.079).
Hyperglycemia decreased BrdU-labeled cells in SVZ
after ischemia
To explore whether hyperglycemia negatively inﬂuenced
cell proliferation in ipsilateral SVZ, BrdU was employed

The eﬀect of hyperglycemia on GFAP positive cells
The impact of hyperglycemia on Glial Fibrillary Acidic
Protein (GFAP, astrocyte marker)-positive cells in
ipsilateral SVZ was evaluated due to an important role
of glial cells in neurogenic niche. Both in ischemic
ipsilateral SVZ of 5 and 10 mM groups, GFAP/p-CREB
double staining cells increased markedly, compared with
the sham group. However, such ischemia insult-induced
increase was signiﬁcantly inhibited by severe
hyperglycemia (P < 0.01, Fig. 5A, B).

Severe hyperglycemia repressed phosphorylation of
CREB and expression of BDNF protein in SVZ after
ischemia
BDNF is one of the downstream growth factors regulated
by nuclear transcription factor CREB and thought to be
involved in neurogenesis. To determine whether the
CREB signaling pathway participates in the reduction of

stroke-induced
neurogenesis
under
severe
hyperglycemic conditions, western blotting of total
CREB, phospho-CREB and BDNF was performed in
tissues from operated ipsilateral SVZ of sham,
normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats. In the sham
group, both p-CREB and BDNF proteins were detected
at a relatively low level (Fig. 6A, B). After ischemia, the
expressions of both p-CREB and BDNF in the
normoglycemic group peaked at 6 h following MCAO
and decreased thereafter (Fig. 6A–D). The alteration in
10 mM group showed a similar trend (Fig. 6A, B).
Diﬀering from the above-mentioned groups, both pCREB and BDNF proteins in 20 mM group only
increased at the 6-h time point and were signiﬁcantly
lower than the normoglycemic group at all time
points(Fig. 6C, D). Consistent with the ﬁndings observed
by confocal microscopy Semi-quantitative analysis did
not reveal a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in p-CREB and BDNF
protein expression between the 10 mM group and the
normoglycemic group at any time point (Fig. 6C, D).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the eﬀect of poststroke hyperglycemia in an animal stroke model. Our
results indicate that severe hyperglycemia (20 mM)
augments infarct size, aggravates short-term neurologic
deﬁcits, and restrains stroke-induced neurogenesis in
ischemic ipsilateral SVZ, however, the above-mentioned
observations
are
not
conﬁrmed
under
mild
hyperglycemia
(10 mM).
Furthermore,
severe
hyperglycemia down-regulates phosphorylation levels of
CREB both in DCX-labeled NPSCs and GFAP-positive
astrocytes in the ipsilateral SVZ, accompanied with
lower
expression
of
BDNF.
Unlike
severe
hyperglycemia, mild hyperglycemia does not change
CREB/BDNF signaling in the ipsilateral SVZ.
Over the past decades, clinical observational and
epidemiologic
studies
show
that
post-stroke
hyperglycemia is independently connected with higher
mortality, poorer functional recovery (Capes et al., 2001;
Kes et al., 2007; Dave et al., 2010) as well as brain infarct
expansion, identiﬁed by Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) (Capes et al., 2001; Parsons et al., 2002), especially in non-diabetic patients. Nevertheless, a randomized, placebo-controlled glucose potassium insulin (GKI)
infusion trial has achieved a normalized blood glucose
level in patients with admission glucose >126 mg/dl
(7 mM) within 24 h of ischemic stroke, yet failed to attenuate infarct volume (McCormick et al., 2010). Hence, the
causal relationship between post-stroke hyperglycemia
and infarct volume remains inconclusive. To our knowledge, post-stroke hyperglycemia can be contributed to
underlying impaired glucose tolerance, unrecognized diabetes mellitus and stress hyperglycemia (Capes et al.,
2001; Jia et al., 2012; Desilles et al., 2013; Arnold et al.,
2014). A recent meta-analysis including 23 experimental
MCAO studies revealed that severe hyperglycemia
(mostly
>20 mM)
exacerbated
infarct
volume
(MacDougall and Muir, 2011), while most enrolled studies
in that meta-analysis tested their hypotheses in diabetic
models which diﬀer from stress hyperglycemia in pathophysiology. The present study was designed to model
the eﬀects of the acute, stress-induced hyperglycemia.
Our results showed an enlargement in the infarct size,
consistent with poor neurological severity score in rats
with severe hyperglycemia (20 mM), but not in rats rendered mild hyperglycemia (10 mM), indicating a detriment
role of high glucose depending on the extent of
hyperglycemia.
Increasing evidences show ischemic insult stimulates
new neuronal generation in neurogenic zone(Liu et al.,
1998; Jin et al., 2001; Kernie and Parent, 2010) and several studies demonstrate such stroke-induced neurogenesis contributes to anatomical and functional outcome
using ablation techniques(Raber et al., 2004; Jin et al.,
2010; Sun et al., 2012, 2013; Wang et al., 2012). As for
the role of hyperglycemia in neurogenesis, some studies
indicate that long-term hyperglycemia suppresses proliferation of hippocampus NSPCs using streptozotocin(STZ) induced type 1 diabetes model (Jackson-Guilford
et al., 2000; Saravia et al., 2004; Beauquis et al., 2006;
Zhang et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010) or spontaneous type

145

1 diabetes model (Beauquis et al., 2008; Guo et al.,
2010), while other researches ﬁnd an enhanced proliferation of NSPCs employing type 2 diabetes model (Lang
et al., 2009; Ramos-Rodriguez et al., 2014). The discrepancy among studies may be attributed to diﬀerent hyperglycemic models and target blood glucose levels. The
impact of hyperglycemia per se on proliferation of
NSPCs cannot be fully elucidated using diabetic models
due to concomitant pathophysiologic confounders, such
as insulin deﬁciency or resistance, and excessive activation of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA). As we
all know, upregulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factors
(IGF) signaling reinforced neurogenesis (Erickson et al.,
2008; Speder et al., 2011; Supeno et al., 2013; Huat
et al., 2014). Additionally, patients with poorly controlled
diabetes exhibit elevated circulating glucocorticoid levels
(Messier, 2005) and corticosterone, meanwhile, could
inhibit neurogenesis in adults rats (Gould et al., 1992;
Cameron and Gould, 1994). Furthermore, impaired neurogenesis can be partially reversed either through normalizing corticosterone levels (Stranahan et al., 2008) or
blockade of glucocorticoid receptor (Revsin et al., 2009).
In view of this, we adopted an intraperitoneal injection of
glucose, which maintained hyperglycemia during ischemia, in order to explore the eﬀect of hyperglycemia per
se on proliferation of NSPCs in SVZ. Our results demonstrated that severe hyperglycemia (20 mM) dramatically
abated BrdU-positive proliferating cells, DCX-positive
neural progenitor cells and BrdU/DCX double-positive
newly generated neural progenitors cells in the ipsilateral
SVZ, indicating an impairment of stroke-induced neurogenesis under 20 mM blood glucose, a level considerably
greater than is typically encountered in clinical practice
(fewer than 2% of subjects) (MacDougall and Muir,
2011). One study notices that 6-week mild hyperglycemia
(810 mM) in spontaneous type 2 diabetic rats increases
proliferation of adult neural progenitors both in SVZ and
DG (Lang et al., 2009). However, we failed to ﬁnd that
short-term mild hyperglycemia (10 mM) has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on stroke-induced proliferation of NSPCs in ipsilateral SVZ. Therefore, more researches are warranted to
identify the threshold above which there is a negative
eﬀect on the self-repair mechanism.
Potential mediators of stroke-induced neurogenesis
are beginning to be identiﬁed. Previous data show that
administration of growth factors, such as stem cell factor
(Jin et al., 2002), epidermal growth factor (Teramoto
et al., 2003; Kolb et al., 2007), vascular endothelial growth
factor (Sun et al., 2003) and ﬁbroblast growth factor(Leker
et al., 2007), stimulates stroke-induced neurogenesis.
Conversely, downregulation of growth factor in knockout
mice impedes neurogenesis after stroke, for instance,
BDNF (Chen et al., 2005), indicating an important role
of growth factors in stroke-induced neurogenesis.
Transcription factors by which the expression of growth
factors is rigorously modulated receive great interest.
CREB is a transcription factor that acts as a central regulator of NSPCs proliferation and survival, and common
ﬁnal phosphorylation substrate for several kinasemediated
signaling
pathways,
including
the
cAMP/Protein kinase A pathway, calcium–calmodulin-m

ediated NMDA receptor signaling, phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, as well as MAP kinase signaling (Peltier et al., 2007; Mantamadiotis et al., 2012; Faigle
and Song, 2013; Jiang et al., 2015). Administration of
pharmacological CREB activator (Nakagawa et al.,
2002) or retroviral vector-mediated over-expression of
wild-type CREB (Peltier et al., 2007) increases adult hippocampus neural progenitor proliferation, whereas dominant negative CREB (Peltier et al., 2007) or conditional
gene knockout of CREB (Dworkin et al., 2009) exerts an
opposed inﬂuence. Our observations illustrated that
ischemic insult promoted activation of CREB, yet such
promotion was inhibited under severe hyperglycemia
(20 mM), as shown by markedly reduction of DCX/pCREB double-positive neural progenitors as well as
expressions of p-CREB and BDNF protein, indicating a
negative role of severe hyperglycemia in CREB signaling.
As an important component of neurogenic niche,
astrocytes play a special role in neurogenesis, by
expressing membrane-associated or secreted proneurogenic factors involved in the proliferation or
neuronal diﬀerentiation of NSPCs (Song et al., 2002; Ma
et al., 2005; Ashton et al., 2012). It is observed that cerebral ischemia raises adenosine triphosphate (ATP) outﬂow in the striatum (Melani et al., 2005), which elicits
the gene expression of BDNF through P2Y receptor followed by the activation of CREB in astrocytes (Takasaki
et al., 2008). In accordance with that, our data showed
increased p-CREB/GFAP double-positive cells in the normoglycemic and 10 mM groups which indicated that
ischemia triggered phosphorylation of CREB in astrocytes. But such activation was mitigated by severe hyperglycemia. From our results we could infer that severe
instead of mild hyperglycemia inhibits stroke-induced
NSPCs proliferation by a mechanism involving suppression of CREB/BDNF signaling in both NSPCs and
astrocytes.

CONCLUSION
Our ﬁndings indicate that severe (20 mM) instead of mild
(10 mM) hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury and
inhibits stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis by a
mechanism involving suppression of CREB and BDNF
signaling.
