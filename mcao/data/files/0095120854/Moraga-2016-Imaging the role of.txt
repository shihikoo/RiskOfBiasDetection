Abstract
The influence of toll-like receptor 4 on neurogenesis and inflammation has been scarcely explored so far by using
neuroimaging techniques. For this purpose, we performed magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with 30 -deoxy-30 -[18F]fluorothymidine and [11C]PK11195 at 2, 7, and 14 days following cerebral ischemia in TLR4þ/
þ
and TLR4/ mice. MRI showed similar infarction volumes in both groups. Despite this, positron emission tomography
with 30 -deoxy-30 -[18F]fluorothymidine and [11C]PK11195 evidenced an increase of neurogenesis and a decrease of
inflammation in TLR4/ mice after ischemia. These results evidence the versatility of neuroimaging techniques to
monitor the role of toll-like receptor 4 after cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Focal cerebral ischemia triggers diﬀerent cellular
responses that occur the following days after the
onset of ischemia. These events include both neuroinﬂammation and regenerative responses that involve
activation of resident microglia/macrophages and the
proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells.1,2
Innate immunity through toll-like receptors induces
and mediates an inﬂammatory response by production
of pro-inﬂammatory mediators3 that are involved in the
brain damage produced by ischemia. Indeed, we and
others demonstrated the implication of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the acute cerebral damage and inﬂammation elicited by an ischaemic injury.4–7 TLR4 is
predominantly expressed in microglia; importantly, it
has been described that activated microglia is not
always detrimental on stroke outcome but can mediate
repair eﬀects.8 In this context, inﬂammation involves a
dramatic increase in the expression of the translocator

protein (18 kDa) (TSPO).9 For this reason, these receptors have become a potential target to study the

neuroinﬂammatory processes following brain injury
using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.10
Speciﬁcally, [11C]PK11195 is a selective radioligand that
has been widely used to evaluate TSPO expression in
rodents11,12 and in the human brain13 after cerebral
ischemia. On the other hand, TLR4 plays an important
role in adult neurogenesis by inhibiting both neuronal
proliferation and diﬀerentiation in rat under physiological conditions.14 Of note, we have demonstrated
that TLR4 modulates stroke-induced neurogenesis by
promoting neuroblasts migration and thus increasing
the number of new cortical neurons after stroke.15
Likewise, cell proliferation in rat brain after cerebral
ischemia may be visualized in vivo with PET using the
30 -deoxy-30 -[18F]ﬂuorothymidine
([18F]FLT).1
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to
image cell proliferation and inﬂammation as TSPO
receptor expression by using PET with [18F]FLT and
[11C]PK11195, respectively, in the presence and the
absence of TLR4 following experimental stroke in mice.

Materials and methods
Animals and surgery
Adult male C57BL/10ScNJ (TLR4/) (n ¼ 21) and
C57BL/10 J (TLR4þ/þ) (n ¼ 26) (2–3 months old) were
used (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME). Animal studies
were approved by the animal ethics committee of CIC
biomaGUNE and local authorities and were conducted
in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines and
Directives of the European Union on animal ethics
and welfare. Since we demonstrated that TLR4þ/þ
mice showed bigger infarcts than TLR4/ mice4 and
that cell proliferation is dependent on infarct size after
stroke,15 we performed a proximal occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in TLR4/ mice
(n ¼ 16) and a distal occlusion of the MCAO in
TLR4þ/þ mice (n ¼ 13) to obtain similar infarct sizes
and thus to avoid the bias due to diﬀerent infarct sizes.
Brieﬂy, permanent focal cerebral ischemia was done
under anesthesia with 2% isoﬂuorane in 100% O2 by
ligature of the MCA before its bifurcation between the
frontal and parietal branches (proximal occlusion) or
more distally (distal occlusion) as described elsewhere.15
Sham operation (n ¼ 10) and nonoperated (n ¼ 8) mice
were also included in the study as controls.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and infarct
determination
MRI experiments were performed to examine the
extent of brain infarction in those animals included in
the nuclear studies. T2-weighted (T2W) MRI scans were
performed in ischemic animals (n ¼ 13) at 24 h after

703
occlusion. Measurements were performed under
1.5–2% of isoﬂuorane in 100% O2 and normothermic
conditions by using an 11.7 T Bruker Biospec system
with a 72 mm volumetric quadrature coil for excitation
and a 20 mm surface coil for reception. Acquisition parameters for the T2 weighted spin echo images were
as follows: TR/TE ¼ 5000/12 ms, fov ¼ 18  18 mm2,
matrix ¼ 200  200, averages ¼ 4, slice thickness ¼
0.5 mm and n slices ¼ 32. T2W images were used to
manually deﬁne the percent of hemisphere infarcted
volume (HIV %) using ImageJ 1.44 l (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA) and the following formula: HIV% ¼ [1
(LN/R)]  100.

Radiochemistry
[11C]PK11195 was synthesized by methylation (R)-Ndesmethyl-PK11195 (1 mg, ABX) using [11C]CH3I
prepared by the gas phase method.16 Methylation was
conducted following the captive solvent method17 using
dimethylsulfoxide as the solvent and potassium hydroxide as the base. Puriﬁcation by high-performance liquid
chromatography
(HPLC)
(stationary
phase:
Mediterranean Sea18, 9.6 mm 250 mm, 5 mm particle
size, Teknokroma, Spain; mobile phase: water/acetonitrile, 25/75; retention time: 7–8 min) followed by reformulation and sterile ﬁltration yielded [11C]PK11195
with average decay corrected radiochemical yield and
speciﬁc activity of 40  8% and 125  38 GBq/mmol,
respectively, in an overall production time of 42 min.
Radiochemical purity was higher than 99% at injection
time.
The synthesis of 30 -deoxy-30 -[18F]ﬂuorothymidine
18
([ F]FLT) was performed as described earlier18 using
a TRACERlab FXFN synthesis module (GE
Healthcare). After puriﬁcation by HPLC (stationary
phase: VP125/10 Nucleosil 100-7 C18 column,
Macherey-Nagel; mobile phase: 0.01 M aqueous
NaH2PO4/ethanol, 90/10; retention time: 13–14 min)
and sterile ﬁltration, injectable [18F]FLT solution was
obtained with nondecay corrected radiochemical yield
of 7.5  1.1% in an overall production time of 62 min.
Radiochemical purity was above 95% in all cases.

PET scans and data acquisition
PET scans were repeatedly performed in ischemic
TLR4/ (n ¼ 8) and TLR4þ/þ (n ¼ 5), sham-operated
(n ¼ 10) at two, seven, and 14 days after surgery as well
as in nonoperated rats used as controls (n ¼ 8) using a
GE eXplore Vista CT camera. Animals were subjected
to two PET scans with [11C]PK11195 and [18F]FLT.
First, mice were anesthetized, injected with around 20
MBq of [11C]PK11195 and placed into the PET camera
under 1.5–2% of isoﬂuorane in 100% O2 and

704
normothermic conditions. Brain dynamic images were
acquired for 10 frames and 27 min. Second, after at
least 180 min, animals were reanesthetized, injected
with around 20 MBq of [18F]FLT and scanned with
PET for 18 frames and 60 min. After PET scans, CT
acquisitions were performed providing anatomical
information and the attenuation map for image reconstruction. Dynamic acquisitions were reconstructed
with ﬁltered back projection using a Ramp ﬁlter with
a cutoﬀ frequency of 0.5 mm1.
PET images were analyzed using PMOD image analysis software (PMOD Technologies Ltd, Zürich,
Switzerland). For the analysis of PET signal, both
PET images and an MRI (T2W) mouse brain template
were separately coregistered to the CT of the same
animal to generate a spatial normalization.
Subsequently, MRI brain template was coregistered to
PET images. Two types of volumes of interest (VOIs)
were established as follows: (i) For the [11C]PK11195, a
ﬁrst set of VOIs was automatically generated in the ipsilateral brain cortex by using the region proposed by the
PMOD mouse brain template. (ii) For the [18F]FLT, a
second set of spherical VOIs was manually deﬁned in the
ipsilateral subventricular zone. For quantiﬁcation of
both VOIs, last three frames (last 15 min of PET acquisition for [18F]FLT and 10 min for [11C]PK11195) were
averaged and the uptake in each VOI (mean  standard
deviation) was determined and expressed as percentage
of injected dose per cubic centimeter (%ID/cc).

Brain dissociation and BrdU cell suspensions analysis
by flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed at 48 h after MCAO in
TLR4/ (n ¼ 4) and TLR4þ/þ (n ¼ 5). Mice brain were
removed, ipsilateral and contralateral cortex were dissected with a scalpel, placed into 15 ml of ice-cold
HBSS, and dissociated in a single cell suspension using
a Potter-Elvehjem-type tissue grinder with teﬂon pestles.
Cell suspension was ﬁltered on 70 mm nylon mesh strainers and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min. Pellets were
resuspended in 35% Percoll isotonic. Cells were centrifuged at 800 g for 45 min at 4 C and pelleted cells were
ﬁxed and permeabilized. After DNAse treatment, cells
were incubated whit an anti-BrdU antibody and 500,000
cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer
with CellQuest software (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
CA). Isotype controls (Miltenyi) and BrdU negative controls were used in parallel. Data were analyzed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc, USA).

Immunohistochemistry and cell counts
Immunohistochemistry staining was performed at day
2 after ischemia. TLR4/ (n ¼ 4) and TLR4þ/þ (n ¼ 3)

Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism 36(4)
mice were terminally anesthetized followed by transcardiac perfusion through the left ventricle with 0.1 M
phosphate buﬀer as a vascular rinse, followed by a
ﬁxing solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed,
postﬁxed overnight, and placed in 30% sucrose for
48 h. Coronal series sections (40 mm) were cut on a
freezing
microtome
(Leica
SM2000R;
Leica
Microsystems GMbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and stored
in cryoprotective solution. Double-label immunoﬂuorescence was performed on free-ﬂoating sections and
incubated overnight at 4 C with the primary antibodies
rabbit anti-mouse TSPO (NP155, 1:1000) and rat antimouse CD11b (1:300; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC,
USA). After incubating with the primary antibody, sections were washed, incubated for 2 h with secondary
antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and
Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat (ThermoFisher, Madrid,
Spain), and mounted with a prolong antifade kit in
slices (ThermoFisher, Madrid, Spain). Images acquisition was performed with an Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss,
Madrid, Spain) equipped with a motorized stage. The
number of TSPO/CD11b-immunopositive cells within
the ischemic area was assessed at day 2 after ischemia.
Cells were counted in 10 diﬀerent ﬁelds at 100X magniﬁcation. Representative images of areas showing the
highest staining density was analyzed using ImageJ version 1.48v (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SD. Imaging comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired
Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA with the
Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests for post hoc analysis for imaging studies. Flow cytometry values were
compared using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
post hoc test. Microglial expression of TSPO receptor
at day 2 after ischemia in TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/ was
compared using an unpaired t-test. Diﬀerences were
considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses
were performed with GraphPad Prism version 6
software.

Results
Effect of TLR4 on SVZ cell proliferation
by using [18F]FLT PET
To study the eﬀect of TLR4 on SVZ cell proliferation
without the inﬂuence of lesion size as we have recently
demonstrated,15 a distal occlusion in TLR4þ/þ and a
proximal occlusion in TLR4/ were carried out. The
extent of brain damage was assessed using T2W-MRI at
one day after ischemia onset. Both groups of mice

subjected to nuclear studies presented similar infarct
volumes (Figure 1(a)). Our data evidenced that the
absence of TLR4 promotes cell proliferation in the ispilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) after MCAO, as
demonstrated by an increase of [18F]FLT binding in
the SVZ at day 2 after ischemic onset when compared
with those from TLR4þ/þ mice (Figure 1(b)). TLR4/
mice evidenced a signiﬁcant over-increase of the
[18F]FLT PET signal at day 2 in relation to control
(Figure 1(c), p < 0.05) and TLR4þ/þ mice (Figure
1(c), p < 0.05) that was followed by a progressive
decrease over time. Likewise, the contralateral SVZ
area did not evidence [18F]FLT binding changes in
the absence or presence of TLR4 (Figure 1(d)).
Hence, these results evidenced a role of TLR4 on ischemia-induced neurogenesis in mice.

Role of TLR4 on microglia proliferation by using
[11C]PK11195 PET and flow cytometry
The time course of the TSPO receptor was evaluated
using [11C]PK11195 in both TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/
mice at two, seven, and 14 days following pMCAO
(Figure 2(a)). At day 2, TLR4þ/þ mice showed a signiﬁcant increase in the [11C]PK11195 PET signal in the
ipsilateral cortical region with respect to those in ischemic TLR4/ and control wild-type mice (Figure 2(b);
p < 0.05). This was followed by a later signiﬁcant signal
increase in both TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/ when compared to control PET data (Figure 2(b); p < 0.05). At
day 14 after ischemia onset, [11C]PK11195 signal
decreased in both animal groups. Likewise, sham-operated animals did not experience TSPO changes over
time evidencing the lack of eﬀect of the surgery in the
[11C]PK11195 signal uptake. In the contralateral
cortex, [11C]PK11195 PET signal did not show signiﬁcant changes in both TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/ mice
(Figure 2(c)). Therefore, these results evidenced
TLR4-induced inﬂammatory response following cerebral ischemia in mice. Likewise, we have determined
the number of new proliferative cells (BrdUþ cells) at
cortical area by using ﬂow cytometry. We have found
that TLR4þ/þ mice show a signiﬁcant increase in the
BrdU positive cells (proliferative cells) in the ipsilateral
cortical region with respect to those in ischemic TLR4/

at two days after ischemic insult (Figure 2(d)). In the
contralateral cortex, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
changes in both TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/ mice
(Figure 2(d)). Finally, immunohistochemistry evidenced the expression of TSPO receptor in microglial
cells in both TLR4þ/þ and TLR4/ mice at day 2 after
cerebral ischemia. Nevertheless, the number of TSPOþ/
CD11bþ cells showed a signiﬁcant increase of microglial cells expressing TSPO receptors in TLR4þ/þ in

ischemia. p* < 0.05 compared with TLR4þ/þ and p& < 0.05 compared with control.

relation to TLR4 deﬁcient mice (Figure 2(e); p < 0.001).
Hence, these results support that the reduction of both
[11C]PK11195-PET signal and cell proliferation at day 2
in TLR4/ mice was due to a decrease on microglial cells.

Discussion
Molecular imaging modalities have allowed the spatiotemporal evaluation of molecular events within the

Moraga et al.
diseased nervous system following stroke.19 Despite
this, the imaging of TLR4 eﬀect on brain damage,
inﬂammation,4,5 and stroke-derived neurogenesis15 following cerebral ischemia has been poorly evaluated to
date. For this reason, we have explored the role of
TLR4 on neurogenesis and inﬂammation after stroke
in mice by using MRI and PET.
After cerebral ischemia, TLR4/ mice have showed
lower infarct volumes and better outcome in neurological evaluations.15,16 Since diﬀerences in infarct
volume may aﬀect ischemia-induced responses, we performed a proximal occlusion of the MCA in TLR4deﬁcient mice and a distal occlusion of the MCA in
wild-type animals (TLR4þ/þ) to guarantee similar
infarct volumes sizes in both mice groups
(Figure 1(a)). In these conditions, our present data
have shown the eﬀect of TLR4 on both cell proliferation and neuroinﬂammation after cerebral ischemia.
[18F]FLT binding evidenced a signiﬁcant increase in
the neurogenic activity at the ipsilateral SVZ of TLR4/

mice at day 2 in comparison to TLR4þ/þ mice, followed by a progressive decrease over time (Figure 1(b)
and (c)). These results are in agreement with the ﬁndings showing that TLR4 inhibits proliferation in the
SVZ under physiological conditions14 and those
found by Moraga and collaborators where TLR4
exerted a negative eﬀect on SVZ cell proliferation
after stroke.15 Likewise, PET studies showed a progressive nonsigniﬁcant trend toward an increase of
[18F]FLT binding in wild-type animals over time
(Figure 1(c)). These results evidenced that the absence
of TLR4 triggered an increase of proliferation in SVZ
populations whereas in wild-type animals this increase
was milder and delayed on time.
On the other hand, by using PET imaging and ﬂow
cytometry we have conﬁrmed that ischemia—as reported—induced the microglia proliferation in the ipsilesional cortex when compared with the control group or
contralateral hemisphere, respectively (Figure 2(b) and
(d)). Importantly, TLR4 has been shown to be
expressed in microglia and astrocytes after stroke and
to be involved in neuroinﬂammation.4,5 For instance, it
has been recently shown that the inhibition of TLR4
with an antagonist protects against cerebral ischemia in
mice by reducing the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines.17 Likewise, it has been shown that 45% of the
total number of BrdU positive cells in infarcted zone
after stroke corresponds to reactive microglia18 and
that TSPO expression has also been attributed to the
activation of microglia/inﬁltrated macrophages following cerebral ischemia.2 Indeed, our results conﬁrmed
the TSPO expression in microglial cells in both
TRL4þ/þ and TLR4/ mice at day 2 after MCAO.
In agreement with these ﬁndings, we observed a

707
signiﬁcant increase of [11C]PK11195 binding, cortical
BrdU positive cells, and microglia-expressing TSPO
receptors in TRL4þ/þ mice in relation to TLR4/ at
day 2 after MCAO, evidencing the role of TRL4 on the
neuroinﬂammation following cerebral ischemia.
In contrast, the protective eﬀect of the lack of TLR4
on the inﬂammatory reaction was lost at day 7 after
ischemia conﬁrming that the eﬀect of TLR4 on inﬂammation behaves in a time-dependent manner. Besides,
the present study showed a relatively earlier TSPO
overexpression in comparison to previous studies.2,11,19,20 These diﬀerences may be related to diﬀerential pattern of leukocyte inﬁltration depending on the
mice model of cerebral ischemia used.21 According to
this study, mice subjected to permanent MCAO showed
both an earlier and extensive neuroinﬂammatory reaction than mice subjected to transient models of MCAO.

Summary and conclusions
In summary, we report here for the ﬁrst time a PET
imaging study of the eﬀect of TLR4 on neurogenesis
and inﬂammation following cerebral ischemia. These
results show that the lack of TLR4 increases neurogenesis and inhibits acute inﬂammatory response after
ischemia. Therefore, our data suggest that a more precise and personalized knowledge of inﬂammation and
proliferation could foster the development of individualized treatments for the improvement of the outcome of
these processes in diﬀerent pathologies such as stroke.
