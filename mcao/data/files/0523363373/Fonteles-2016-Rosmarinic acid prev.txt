Polyphenols have neuroprotective effects after brain ischemia. It has been demonstrated that rosmarinic
acid (RA), a natural phenolic compound, possesses antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties. To
evaluate the effectiveness of RA against memory deﬁcits induced by permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) mice were treated with RA (0.1, 1, and 20 mg/kg/day, i.p. before ischemia and during 5
days). Animals were evaluated for locomotor activity and working memory 72 h after pMCAO, and spatial
and recognition memories 96 h after pMCAO. In addition, in another set of experiments brain infarction,
neurological deﬁcit score and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were evaluates 24 h after the pMCAO.
Finally, immunohistochemistry, and western blot, and ELISA assay were used to analyze glial ﬁbrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), and synaptophysin (SYP) expression, and BDNF level, respectively. The working,
spatial, and recognition memory deﬁcits were signiﬁcantly improved with RA treatment (20 mg/kg). RA
reduced infarct size and neurological deﬁcits caused by acute ischemia. The mechanism for RA neuroprotection involved, neuronal loss suppression, and increase of synaptophysin expression, and increase
of BDNF. Furthermore, the increase of MPO activity and GFAP immunireactivity were prevented in MCAO
group treated with RA. These results suggest that RA exerts memory protective effects probably due to
synaptogenic activity and anti-inﬂammatory action.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the major cause of disability and the fourth leading
cause of death worldwide. Approximately 100,000 deaths occurs
annually due to stroke [1,2,]. Ischemic injury is associated with

vascular leakage, inﬂammation, tissue injury, and cell death [3].
Cellular changes associated with ischemia include impairment of
metabolism, energy failure, free radical production, excitotoxicity, altered calcium homeostasis, and protease activation; all these
events affect brain function and contribute to long term disabilities [4]. It has been conﬁrmed that stroke can result in cognitive
impairment, and the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment ranges from 20% to 80% [5] and more than a third of the
patients have cognitive impairment after transient ischemic attack
[6]. A mechanism involved in cognitive deﬁcits after stroke is synaptic protein loss [7]. The disappearance of synaptic activity is one

92

of the ﬁrst consequences of ischemia [8]. A blood ﬂow less than
20% leads to a loss of axons and dendrites in minutes [9,10]. Moreover, inﬂammation plays a signiﬁcant role in the pathogenesis
of ischemic stroke [11]. The inﬂammation responses after brain
ischemia include astrocyte and microglial activation, followed by
peripheral inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration in the core and penumbra
zone of ischemia [12,13]. Ischemia evokes strong reactive astrogliosis that activates induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH
oxidase to produce NO and superoxide, which are involved in lipid
peroxidation, and the release of cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1
[12]. These cytokines, depending on the concentrations, may inhibit
synaptic transmission or act as neuromodulators [14]. After brain
ischemia, astrogliosis has both beneﬁcial and deleterious effects
and astrocyte activation is an important proliferative component
during synaptogenesis [8,15]. Studies show that astrocytes release
mediators that inﬂuence from the genesis of synapses until their
stabilization [16,17]. In addition to astrogliosis, neurotrophic factors such as BDNF play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity [18],
neuronal survival, and growth [19]. Studies show that systemic
administration of BDNF promotes recovery after stroke [20].
Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic compound with potent
antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activities [21]. RA has neuroprotective action in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease [22–24] and, Parkinson’s disease [25],
as well as in ischemia/reperfusion models [26]. However, currently,
there are no reports regarding the protective effects of rosmarinic
acid on memory deﬁcits following focal cerebral ischemia. Thus, the
aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of RA on memory deﬁcits induced by permanent focal cerebral ischemia, thereby
investigating the mechanism of action.

2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Male Swiss mice weighing 25–30 g obtained from the Central
Animal House of Physiology and Pharmacology Department of Federal University of Ceará were used. Animals were housed under a

12-h-light, 12-h-dark cycle and allowed free access to food and
water. All procedures in this study were in agreement with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the Institute
for Laboratory Animal Research of the National Research Council
published by the National Academies Press (Washington, District
of Columbia, USA) and were approved by the ethics committee on
animal experimentation of the Federal University of Ceará.
2.2. Drugs
The following drugs were used: rosmarinic acid (SIGMA,
USA); xylazine (2%, Kensol® , König, Argentina) and ketamine (5%,
Vetanarcol® , König, Argentina). All other reagents were of analytical grade.
2.3. Induction of permanent media cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO)
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) was produced by electrocoagulation of the left middle cerebral artery as
reported previously [27]. Brieﬂy, animals were anaesthetized with
xylazine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and ketamine (90 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally), an incision was made on the left temporoparietal region, and the temporalis muscle was partially removed. A
burr hole was drilled into the skull over the middle cerebral artery
and the vessel was occluded directly, proximal to the lateral lenticulostriate branches, using electrocoagulation with a micro-unipolar
coagulator. The complete interruption of the blood ﬂow was conﬁrmed by visual inspection. Body temperature was kept close to
37 ◦ C. Sham-operated animals (SO group) were subjected to the
same procedure, with the exception of cauterization of the middle cerebral artery. Thirty minutes before and 1 h after pMCAO,
the animals received either NaCl 0.9% (pMCAO group) or RA (0.1, 1
and 20 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) for 5 consecutive days. There
were two groups of sham-operated animals: one group received
NaCl 0.9% and the other group was treated with RA (20 mg/kg/day).
In the ﬁrst set of experiments, animals were tested for neurological evaluation and euthanized for ischemic damage evaluation 24 h

after ischemia (n = 6/group). In a second set, animals were evaluated for locomotor activity and working memory (n = 8/groups) at
72 h after surgery, and immunohistochemistry (n = 4/group) at 96 h
after surgery. In a third set, animals were evaluated at 4 and 5 days
for recognition and spatial memories (n = 8/group) and western
blot (n = 4/group). Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis and behavioral investigations were performed at the indicated
time points (Fig. 1).

2.4. Quantiﬁcation of infarct area through TTC staining
Six animals of each group were euthanized by cervical dislocation 24 h after ischemia. Brains were removed and 2-mm
coronal sections were made from the prefrontal cortex to the
midbrain. Slices were immersed in 1% solution of TTC (2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium) in normal saline at 37 ± ◦ C for 15 min. This
salt accepts a proton from succinate dehydrogenase in the inner
membrane of the mitochondria which reduces it to its red, insoluble form known as formazan [28]. Thus, an area with inactive
enzymes and the infarction is not stained and appears pale. The
unstained areas were measured by the Osiris software (University
of Geneva, Switzerland, Switzerland) and calculated as the percent
of the entire coronal section.

2.5. Neurological evaluation
Neurological evaluation was performed 24 h after ischemia by
an investigator who was blinded to the experimental group design.
The neurologic ﬁndings were scored using a scale described previously by Garcia et al. [29]. Six items were measured and the total
score ranged from 3 to 18; the higher the score, the better the motor
performance. Items 1–4 (spontaneous activity, symmetry of movements, symmetry of forelimbs, and climbing the wall of wire cage)
measured motor performance, items 5–6 (reaction to touch on and
response to vibrissae touch) measured sensory function (Table 1).

2.6. Open-ﬁeld test
The animals in the subgroup 2 were tested for locomotor activity using an open-ﬁeld apparatus, which consisted of a black acrylic
chamber (30 × 30 cm) with the ﬂoor divided into nine squares of
equal areas [30]. Seventy-two hours after surgery, the animal was
positioned in the centre of the arena and allowed to explore freely.
The number of crossings (horizontal exploration) and rearings (vertical exploration) were scored for 5 min. The arena was cleaned with
20% ethyl alcohol to remove any odors before the next test.

93

2.7. Y-maze test
The third day after surgery, spatial working memory was
assessed by recording spontaneous alternation (SA) behavior in
the Y-maze [31]. The maze was constructed of white wood with
three identical arms (40 × 15 × 4.5 cm) positioned at equal angles.
Animals were placed at the end of one arm and allowed to move
freely through the maze during an 8-min session. The series of
arms entries was recorded visually and arm entry was considered
to be complete when the hind paws of the mice were completely
placed in the arm. The ability to alternate requires that the mice
to remember which arms have already been visited. Each experiment was scored, and the percentage of spontaneous alternation
was calculated using the following formula:
SAs(%) =

Alternation behavior
× 100
Maximum alternations

where alternation behavior is deﬁned as consecutive entries into
each of the three arms, without repetition, and maximum alternations are the total number of arm entries, minus two.
2.8. Object recognition test
The fourth day after surgery, recognition memory was assessed
by the object recognition test [32]. The object recognition test
was performed in a black acrylic chamber open-ﬁeld apparatus
(30 × 30 cm). Animals were placed in the experimental room at
least 30 min before testing. In the acquisition session animals were
allowed to freely explore two objects placed in the back left and
right corners of the apparatus ﬂoor-ﬁxed for 10 min. The animals
were placed at the mid-point of the wall opposite the sample
objects. When placed, its body was parallel to the side walls and
its nose pointing away from the objects. After the planned sampleobject exposure time, the animal was removed from the apparatus
and returned to the cage. The objects were cleaned between each
trial using 20% ethyl alcohol to avoid odor trails. In the test session (1 h after acquisition session), one of the familiar sample
objects was placed in one back corner of the apparatus and the
novel object in the other back corner. The objects were different
in shapes and colors. Recognition memory was evaluated using
a recognition index (RI) calculated for each animal using the formula: (N − F/N + F) corresponding to the difference between the
time exploring the novel (N) and the familiar object (F), corrected
for total time exploring both objects.
2.9. Water maze test
In this version of the water maze test, previously described by
Morris et al. [33], the mice learn to swim at a shortest possible

distance from the edges of a water tank for a hidden platform below
the surface. They learn guided by clues in the walls or other visual
stimuli external to the tank. This task space is dependent on the
hippocampus.
The animal was placed randomly in a circular pool (90 cm diameter × 60 cm deep) containing turbid water (white nontoxic paint)
at 26 ◦ C, divided spatially into four quadrants, and should ﬁnd a
platform (7 cm diameter) submerged 2 cm below the water level.
The animal had 60 s to ﬁnd the platform (which remained in the
same place every trail) and remained there for 10 s. This training
was conducted four times a day at intervals of 30 s for two days
(learning) and 48 h after the last training session, the animals were
tested, now without the platform, which was assessed memory
retention. On occasion, the animal remained in the pool for 60 s
and was recorded at the time that the animal remains in the quadrant where the platform should be, the latency time to ﬁnd the
location of the platform and the number of times he crossed the
exact location the platform.
2.10. Myeloperoxidase assay Bradley et al. [34]
Eight animals of each group were euthanized 24 h after pMCAO
and cortex, hippocampus and striatum were removed. Brieﬂy, brain
samples were homogenized (50 mg/mL) in a solution of phosphate
buffer (PBS) (50 mM, pH 6.0) containing 0.5% of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB) (Sigma–Aldrich, USA). Homogenates
were centrifuged at 14,000 g, 4 ◦ C, for 2 min, and then 30 ␮L of
the supernatant was mixed with 0.167 mg/mL of o-dionisidine
dihydrochloride (Sigma–Aldrich, USA) and 0.0005% of hydrogen
peroxide (Carlo Herba, Italy) in a ﬁnal volume of 230 ␮L, plated
in a 96 well plate. Then the absorbance change at 460 nm was measured with a plate spectrophotometer in 0.1 and 3 min. One unit
of activity was deﬁned as that degrading 1 ␮mol of peroxide/min.
Results are presented as MPO activity (U/mg tissue).
2.11. Immunohistochemistry
Brains were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde by transcardiac
perfusion and post-ﬁxed in the same solution for 24 h at 4 ◦ C and
then stored in cryoprotectant solution of sucrose 30%. Free-ﬂoating
sections were ﬁrst rinsed in phosphate buffered saline for 5 min
and then three times for 5 min with Tris buffered saline (TBS,
0.05 M Trizma base buffer containing 150 mM of NaCl, pH 7.2) at
room temperature. Slices were simultaneously permeabilized and
blocked with TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% of normal
goat serum, for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, slices were
incubated, free-ﬂoating, with the primary antibody prepared in
the blocking solution (anti-GFAP, 1:500 dilution, rabbit polyclonal,
Sigma–Aldrich, USA) overnight at 4 ◦ C. Sections were then rinsed
3 × 10 min each, in TBS and subsequently incubated 2 h at room
temperature, with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated
with a ﬂuorophore (Alexa Fluor 594, diluted 1:200 in the blocking
solution, Invitrogen, Portugal). After rising 3× for 10 min in TBS,
the brain sections were incubated with DAPI (Vector Laboratories,
UK) and then mounted on gelatin coated slides using Fluoromount
mounting medium (Sigma–Aldrich, USA). The slides were allowed
to dry protected from light before being stored at −20 ◦ C until
analysis. Sections were visualized under a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Zeiss Imager Z2) or with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM
510 Meta, Zeiss). The immunoreactivity was quantiﬁed in a series
of 8 coronal sections (50 ␮m thick and 300 ␮m apart) representative of the striatum and cortex in 4 animals from each experimental
group. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) was used as a measure of the immunoreactivity and was quantiﬁed using the program
Image J. The values of MFI obtained for the control group (SO) were

averaged and all of the MFI values were calculated as a percentage
of that mean.
2.12. Western blot
Cortical tissue lysates were prepared ﬁfth day after pMCAO
and RA treatment. Brieﬂy, brain samples were homogenized in 5
volumes of ice-cold buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Hepes and 1% BSA, pH 7.4) using a ground-glass homogenizer.
Homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, then the
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h. The
pellet was resuspended in 5% SDS with protease inhibitor cocktail
and protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method.
Samples were heated at 95 ◦ C for 5 min, and proteins (25 ␮g)
were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gels) and electrically transferred
onto a PVDF membrane (BIORAD, USA). The blots were blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline in 0.1% Tween 20
(TBS-T) at 4 ◦ C and incubated with rabbit anti-synaptophysin antibody (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and mouse anti-␣
tubulina antibody (1:4,000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After washing
with buffer TBS-T the membrane was incubated with horseradishperoxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Millipore,
Bedford, MA) or horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:3,300; Bio-Rad; USA) for 1 hour. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized with 3,3 -diaminobenzidine. The density of
synaptophysin immunoreactive bands was measured using ImageJ
software.
2.13. BDNF assay
Six animals of each group were euthanized 120 h after pMCAO
and hippocampus, and striatum were removed. Brieﬂy, brain
samples were homogenized (10% v/v) in a solution of phosphate buffer (PBS) (50 mM, pH 6.0) containing protease inhibitor
(Sigma–Aldrich, USA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14.000 g,
4 ◦ C, for 30 min, and the concentrations of BDNF in the supernatans
were measured with ELISA kit (Quantikine® Elisa R&D SYSTEMS),
according to the manufactures directions.
2.14. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean SEM or as median (interquartile
range) and statistical differences were estimated using either a
one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Newman-Keuls or
Bonferroni post-hoc test, or Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney
U-tests, with a signiﬁcance level of 95%.
3. Results
3.1. Rosmarinic acid treatment reduces infarct area 24 h after
pMCAO
Infarct volumes were evaluated at 24 h after pMCAO. The representative photomicrographs shown in Fig. 2A indicated that
the infarct areas were located mainly in the ipsilateral cortex,
and to a lesser extent in striatum and hippocampus. The animals
treated with rosmarinic acid at doses of 1 and 20 mg/kg had a
signiﬁcant lower ischemic neuronal damage compared to pMCAO
group (pMCAO + RA 0.1: 6.39 ± 1.77%, pMCAO + RA 1:3.43 ± 0.7%5,
pMCAO + RA 20: 2.65 ± 0.85%) (Fig. 2B).

pared to sham-operated animals (SO: 18 (17–18); pMCAO:16
(14–17). The pMCAO animals presented reduced motor ability and
also decreased ability to respond to stimuli on the side of the body
contralateral to ischemia. Animals treated with rosmarinic acid
showed a signiﬁcant improvement in neurological deﬁcits induced
by pMCAO at doses of 1 and 20 mg/kg (pMCAO + RA 0.1:15.5
(15–16), pMCAO + RA 1:17.5 (16–18), pMCAO + RA 20: 17 (17–18),
p < 0.05) (Fig. 3).
3.3. RA has no effect in locomotor activity in pMCAO mice
In the evaluation of locomotor activity 72 h after ischemia were
not observed signiﬁcant changes in the number of crossings or
rearings after pMCAO and/or RA treatment (Fig. 4A and B).
3.4. RA reduces memory deﬁcits induced by pMCAO
The animals subjected to ischemia showed deﬁcits on working memory (SA-SO: 70.2 ± 2.5%; SO + RA 20: 69.2 ± 6.0%; pMCAO:
60.9 ± 2.6%) and on the recognition memory (recognition indexSO: 0.21 ± 0.1; SO + RA 20: 0.39 ± 0.13; pMCAO: −0.09 ± 0.07)
(Figs. 5 and 6). In assessing the retention of spatial memory,
120 h after ischemia, pMCAO group had signiﬁcant deﬁcits in
the parameters latency to reach the platform, number of crossings and time spent in the quadrant (latency: SO: 5.8 ± 1.1 s;
SO + RA 20:9.0 ± 2.1 s; pMCAO: 14.4 ± 2.5 s, number of crossings:
SO: 6.5 ± 0.6; SO + RA 20: 4.2 ± 0.5; pMCAO: 4.0 ± 0.3, time spent
in the quadrant: SO: 22.3 ± 1.6 s; SO + RA 20: 20.0 ± 1.2 s; pMCAO:
17.2 ± 1.0 s) (Fig. 7B–D).
Working and recognition memory deﬁcits were prevented signiﬁcantly by RA (SA: pMCAO + RA 0.1: 62.9 ± 4.3%; pMCAO + RA

pMCAO + RA 20: 0.25 ± 0.11) (Figs. 5 and 6). In relation to spatial memory RA treatment prevented signiﬁcantly the increase
in latency and the decrease in the number of crossings meaning that RA prevented spatial memory deﬁcit induced by pMCAO
(Latency: pMCAO + RA 0.1: 13.0 ± 2.0 s, pMCAO + RA 1: 10.3 ± 3.7 s;
pMCAO + RA 20: 6.4 ± 1.2 s. Number of crossings: pMCAO + RA 0.1:
3.2 ± 0.8; pMCAO + RA 1: 4.4 ± 0.9, pMCAO + RA 20: 5.7 ± 0.5. Time

GFAP expression was found to be higher in ischemic hemisphere
of pMCAO group compared to SO group (SO: 109.2 ± 4.3% of mean
control; pMCAO: 152.9 ± 8.8% of mean control). A signiﬁcant reduction in GFAP expression was observed in ischemic mice treated
with RA (20 mg) as compared to pMCAO group (pMCAO + RA 20:
124.4 ± 6.2% of mean control) (Fig. 9A–G).

3.5. RA treatment prevent the increased levels of MPO induced by
pMCAO
Ischemic mice showed increased levels of MPO in temporal
cortex and striatum 24 h after ischemia (Temporal cortex: SO:
0.85 ± 0.42 U/mg tissue; SO + RA 20: 1.25 ± 0.71 U/mg tissue;
pMCAO: 7.4 ± 1.67 U/mg tissue, striatum: SO: 0.39 ± 0.27 U/mg tissue; SO + RA 20: 0.75 ± 0.36 U/mg tissue; pMCAO: 1.76 ± 0.38 U/mg
tissue), but not in hipoccampus (SO: 0.50 ± 0.27 U/mg tissue;
SO + RA 20: 0.60 ± 0.39 U/mg tissue; pMCAO: 0.68 ± 0.20 U/mg

MPO levels in temporal cortex (pMCAO + RA 20: 3.50 ± 0.87 U/mg
tissue) but not in striatum (Striatum: pMCAO + RA 20:
1.29 ± 0.23 U/mg tissue) (Fig. 8A–C).

Ischemic animals showed lower expression of synaptophysin in
the striatum 5 days after the ischemia, RA treatment inhibited the
reduction of synaptophysin in ischemic animals (SO: 100.0 ± 1.9%;
pMCAO: 73.6 ± 6.5%; pMCAO + RA 20: 88.6 ± 4.0%) (Fig. A and C).
No alteration was found in the hipoccampus (SO: 105.3 ± 9.5%;
pMCAO: 90.7 ± 17.6%; pMCAO + RA 20: 96.2 ± 13.1%) (Fig. 10A and
B).
3.8. RA treatment increased BDNF levels in pMCAO mice
Ischemic animals showed increased levels of BDNF in hippocampus and decreased levels in striatum, and RA treatment increased
BDNF levels in hippocampus of sham-operated and ischemic
mice after 5 days of pMCAO compared to pMCAO group and to
SO group (Hippocampus: SO: 316.1 ± 38.64 pg/mL; SO + RA 20:
1148.0 ± 92.0 pg/mL; pMCAO: 516.8 ± 49.51 pg/mL; pMCAO + RA
20: 868.2 ± 64.30 pg/mL). RA treatment increased BDNF levels
in striatum of ischemic mice after 5 days of pMCAO compared
to pMCAO group (Striatum: SO: 511.2 ± 65.8 pg/mL; SO + RA 20:
336.1 ± 27.17 pg/mL; pMCAO: 239.9 ± 55.80 pg/mL; pMCAO + RA
20: 492.7 ± 42.42 pg/mL) (Fig. 11A and B).

In the present study, we demonstrate the neuroprotective
effect of RA on pMCAO-induced memory deﬁcits in mice. Our
results revealed that RA suppresses the inﬂammatory response
and astroglial activation, and prevent memory deﬁcits induced by
cerebral ischemia probably through synaptogenesis and neurogenesis induction. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that
plant polyphenols provide protection against neurodegenerative
changes associated with cerebral ischemia [35]. Whether regional
differences exist in the brain in the protective effects of polyphenols in ischemic injury is not clear. Most studies have reported
the protective effects of polyphenols in the hippocampal and cerebral cortex regions in ischemia. Inanami et al. [36] observed a
dose-dependent protection against hippocampal neuronal death
in ischemia in gerbils after ad libitum oral administration of cat-

echin, a polyphenol, in the drinking water for 2 weeks. In the
present work, infarction area and neurological evaluation showed
that RA had a neuroprotective effect consistent with the work by
Luan et al. [26] that demonstrated reduced cerebral infarct volume
and neurological deﬁcits in ischemic diabetic rats after treatment
with RA (50 mg/kg). Although, the literature has demonstrated the
neuroprotective effect of RA on ischemic damage, no studies have
demonstrated the RA effect on memory deﬁcit induced by cerebral
ischemia. Our study found that RA signiﬁcantly improved working,
recognition and spatial memory in cerebral ischemic mice.
Y-maze and object recognition tests are related to the frontalsubcortical circuits rather than to the hippocampus [37]. Zhou
et al. [38] demonstrated that transient focal cerebral ischemia
lesions of the striatum and hippocampus caused working memory
deﬁcits in rats assessed by the Y-maze test. Recognition memory
impairment is related to white matter sub-cortical stroke lesions
in mice [39] and parietal cortex in C57B/6 mice after pMCAO [40].
These ﬁndings are consistent with our results that showed that the
striatum and the cortex were largely affected by ischemia, which
induced working and recognition memory deﬁcits. Furthermore,
poor performance in the Morris water-maze test was correlated
with CA1 region damage [41], although the impairment in the spatial memory induced by pMCAO is more likely related to cortical
and striatum damage [42]. The neural substrates most frequently
implicated in various forms of spatial learning are the hippocampus
and the dorsal striatum, with the former being involved in learning with reference to an array of distal cues. This process is often
referred to as the formation of a “cognitive map” [43,33]. The dorsal
striatum is involved in the formation of an association between a
proximal cue in the environment and the animal’s own kinesthetic
response, typically over many repeated trials [44]. In our study, we
observed that mice with pMCAO showed spatial memory impair-

ments, and RA signiﬁcantly attenuated these deﬁcits. RA protects
against working and recognition memory impairment induced by
A␤(25–35) in mice [23] and enhances cognitive performances in the
Morris water-maze task in rats [45]. Previous studies have shown
that RA metabolites, such as Caffeic acid, have neuroprotective
actions [46]. Caffeic acid is reported to reduce brain damage and
prevent memory deﬁcits after permanent focal cerebral ischemia
in mice due to anti-inﬂammatory actions [47].
Because oxidative damage and inﬂammation are implicated in
the etiology of neurological complications in cerebral ischemia,
ﬂooding the system with antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatory compounds may be a sensible step. Phenolic compounds are known
by their antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory effects, which in turn
have neuroprotective effects during cerebral ischemia [48]. Rosmarinic acid is a phenolic compound with potent antioxidant and
anti-inﬂammatory actions and is contained in various Laminaceae
herbs used commonly as culinary herbs, such as Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis [49,21]. RA showed potent antioxidant activity by modulating
H2 O2 -induced cell death in human dopaminergic neurons through
reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging [50]. RA was also found to
suppress lipid peroxidation [51]. Additionally, it has been reported
that RA has the ability to inhibit complement ﬁxation and lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activity [52–54]. Furthermore, RA was
also able to inhibit seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in humans
by suppressing the inﬂammatory response [55]. In rats, RA is rapidly
absorbed in the digestive tract, and the major metabolites found
in urine are caffeic acid, ferulic acid and coumaric acid [56]. RA
is also absorbed in humans after oral administration and speciﬁc
metabolites can be detected in urine [57].

impairment induced by cerebral ischemia. It has been shown that
RA possesses anti-inﬂammatory actions by diminishing IL-1␤ in
an ototoxicity model induced by cisplatin in mice [58], decreased
COX-2 positive cells in a model of collagen induced arthritis [59],
and decreased pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1␤ and TNF-␣
in a rat model of systemic inﬂammation [60]. Furthermore, caffeic
acid, a major RA metabolite, attenuates hippocampal inﬂammation by diminishing neutrophil inﬁltration in mice subjected to
pMCAO [47], RA diminished MPO activity induced by a renal
ischemia/reperfusion model in rats [61], and other polyphenols,
such as pinocembrin, diminished neutrophil inﬁltration in a rat
model of global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion [62]. Forghani and
colleagues [63] demonstrated that MPO-knockout mice subjected
to transient MCAO showed reduced lesion volume and improved
neurobehavioral effects, suggesting that the MPO activity blockade
is an important neuroprotective strategy to attenuate ischemic
damage after 24 h of stroke onset. In accordance with these
ﬁndings, we also found that RA (20 mg/kg) abolished the increase
MPO activity after ischemic injury in cerebral ischemic mice.
BDNF is widely distributed in nerve terminals and synapses
throughout the brain, particularly in the hippocampus [64].
Increased BDNF levels promote neuronal survival and infarct tolerance [65]. Studies show that BDNF levels in ischemic mice are
elevated, and it is probably due to the cleavage of the existing proBDNF in the core of the lesion [66,67]. In the lesioned hemisphere,

mature BDNF is elevated, although in the contralateral hemisphere,
both pro- and mature BDNF are elevated, indicating that in the nonlesioned hemisphere, the overexpression of both forms could be
the result of gene induction [67]. The overexpression of BDNF in
ischemic conditions may describe the self-protecting properties of
neurons after ischemic injury [68]. In the present study, we found
an increasing level of BDNF in the hippocampus of pMCAO mice
5 days after stroke onset. RA increases BDNF levels, causing signiﬁcantly increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus compared to
sham-operated and ischemic mice. Ito and colleagues [69] demonstrated that RA induced cell proliferation of newborn cells in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of mice. These studies corroborate our results, which shows that RA has the ability to self-induce
cell proliferation through the BDNF increase in the dentate gyrus
in the hippocampus; this may explain the neuroprotective effect of
RA on memory deﬁcits. The striatum is a region of the brain that
lacks BDNF mRNA [64], although the BDNF protein can be transferred by an anterograde transport from neuronal cell bodies to
their terminals [70]. BDNF was found to be decreased in the cortex
7 days after transient MCAO, an area that is the core of these types
of ischemic lesions [71]. This ﬁnding is consistent with our results,
which showed decreased BDNF levels in the striatum of pMCAO
mice 5 days after pMCAO.
Our study showed that RA induced an increase in BDNF levels in the ipsilateral hippocampus and striatum of ischemic mice 5

days after stroke onset. Other polyphenols, such as ginsenosides,
have neuroprotective effects, as they increased neurogenesis by
increasing BDNF levels in an oxygen- and glucose-deprived model
in PC12 cells [72]. Oroxylin A, a ﬂavonoid compound, increased
BDNF expression in the hippocampus and has been shown to ameliorate memory impairment and neuronal damage after global
cerebral ischemia in rats [68]. Madinier et al. [67] demonstrated
that BDNF immunoreactivity was colocalized in neurons and in
astrocytes after permanent focal cerebral ischemia by photothrombotic cortical occlusion in rats. BDNF was found to reduce cortical
cell death after transient MCAO in rats [73] and has been shown to
be essential for synaptogenesis and synaptic structural composition in the adult brain [74,75]. The relationship between BDNF and
synaptogenesis is widely studied. Chen et al. [76] have shown that
statin, a BDNF upregulation inductor, is related to an increase of
synaptophysin expression and to functional recovery after stroke.
Pozzo-Miller et al. [77] have shown that BDNF knockout mice have
a reduced level of synaptophysin in hippocampal synaptosomes. Jin
et al. [78] have demonstrated that RA (10 mg/kg) exerts a neuropro-

tective effect by increasing astrocytic BDNF in the hippocampus via
modulation of ERK phosphorylation in chronic unpredictable stress.
Taken together, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis are mechanisms
involved in learning and memory recovery after ischemic events
[79,80]. These mechanisms may, in part, be responsible for the
neuroprotective effect of RA on memory deﬁcits in pMCAO injured
mice.
Synaptophysin has a role in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles, stabilization and modiﬁcation of the function of other synaptic
proteins and protection during ischemic brain injury. It is usually
overexpressed during neuronal remodeling [81]. Increased levels of synaptophysin are interpreted to indicate synaptogenesis
[82]. Ischemic patients show motor and cognitive recovery some
time after the stroke event [83], and the mechanisms involved
are synaptogenesis, axon growth and generation of new cells and
blood vessels [84,85]. Studies have shown that astrocytes play an
important role in synaptogenesis through the release of mediators
that maintain the brain microenvironment even under conditions
in which neurons lose their functionality, which occurs in cere-

bral ischemia. The way in which the activation of astrocytes after
ischemia occurs differs depending on the time and the brain area
that is observed [86,87]. In pathological conditions, astrocytes support neurons with antioxidants and energetic metabolites, such as
lactate and ATP [88,89]. The protective function of reactive astrocytes results from their ability of glutamate re-uptake [90,91],
production of antioxidants such as glutathione and superoxide
dismutase [88], and stimulation of neurogenesis [92–94]. During astrogliosis astrocytic hypertrophy, GFAP up-regulation, gliotic
scar formation, proliferation, and de-differentiation, which are the
most important features of the astrocytic response, occur [95–97].
The most common signaling agents inﬂuencing these reactions
include neurotransmitters and gliotransmitters (ATP, glutamate,
noradrenalin), reactive oxygen species, cytokines and interleukins
[88,98]. Thus, the reactive astrogliosis reveals both detrimental
and neuroprotective roles in the course of pathological processes.
RA prevented the decrease in the synaptophysin levels in the
striatum and decreased astrogliosis, which means that RA might
prevent learning and memory impairment by inhibiting the loss of
synapses or enhancing synaptogenesis by decreasing astrogliosis
and increasing neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, after ischemic
injury.
In conclusion, the present study is the ﬁrst report that RA
prevents memory deﬁcits induced by cerebral ischemia, probably
by anti-inﬂammatory and synaptogenic mechanisms through the
BDNF pathway, although other mechanisms, such as antioxidant
and antiapoptotic actions, cannot be excluded.
