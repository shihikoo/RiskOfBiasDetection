Abstract. It is well established that the brain is sensitive
to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)‑induced injury. α ‑lipoic
acid (LA), a free radical scavenger and antioxidant, has
a neuroprotective effect against cerebral I/R‑induced
injury, however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be
elucidated. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to
evaluate whether LA was able to protect against cerebral
I/R‑induced injury and to examine the potential mechanisms.
The neuroprotective effects of LA were investigated in a rat
model of transient focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. Adult
male Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly assigned into the
sham, cerebral I/R injury model and model plus LA groups.
Cerebral I/R injury was induced by 90 min MCAO followed
by reperfusion for 24 h. Cerebral infarct size was detected
by 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Neurological
deficit score (NDS), brain water content and oxidative
parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide
(NO), total antioxidant capacity (T‑AOC) and superoxide
dismutase (SOD) were measured. The expression of cleaved
caspase‑3, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase (PI3K),
p‑Akt and phosphorylated extracellular signal‑regulated
kinase 1/2 (p‑ERK1/2) were also analyzed using western
blotting. The present study demonstrated that pretreatment
with LA significantly decreased the infarction size, brain
water content and improved NDS. LA reversed the levels

of oxidative parameters, including MDA, NO, T‑AOC and
SOD to their normal state in rat brains following cerebral
I/R. Furthermore, the expression of cleaved caspase‑3 markedly decreased and the expression of BDNF, PI3K, p‑Akt and
p‑ERK1/2 significantly increased following administration
of LA. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that
LA protected the brain from cerebral I/R damage by attenuation of oxidative stress and caspase‑dependent apoptosis.
Furthermore, LA exerts its neuroprotective effects potentially
through activation of the BDNF‑PI3K/Akt‑ERK1/2 pathway.
Introduction
Cerebral ischemic injury is one of the leading causes of
human mortality and disability worldwide (1). Restoration
of blood flow to the ischemic brain is often used to treat
patients in clinical experiments. However, reperfusion itself
also has the potential to produce additional injuries in the
ischemic brain due to overproduction of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). The potential pathological mechanisms of
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury include glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium overload, nitric oxide (NO) production,
oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, which eventually lead to cell death (2). Oxidative stress and apoptosis
following cerebral I/R are the two major processes that
induce neuronal injury (3,4). For this reason, multifunctional
molecules with anti‑oxidative and anti‑apoptotic properties
are ideal neuroprotective agents.
α ‑lipoic acid (LA), an endogenous short‑chain fatty
acid, is a cofactor for multiple mitochondrial dehydrogenase
enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (5). It is an ROS
scavenger, which is able to stimulate the insulin signaling
pathway, chelate metal and regenerate endogenous natural
antioxidants (6). In previous decades, using several different
experimental models of I/R, studies have demonstrated
the protective effects of LA against I/R‑induced injury,
including myocardial injury (7), peripheral nerve injury (8),
testicular injury (9) and retinal injury (10). In addition, it
has been reported that LA can activate phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular
signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways to induce
protection against I/R injury in other organs (11‑13). However,

to the best of our knowledge, few studies were reported to
address whether LA has neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R‑induced injury and its potential mechanisms.
In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of
LA in rats were investigated with 90 min middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO)/24 h reperfusion‑induced injury.
Furthermore, the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effect
of LA is associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and
inhibition of apoptosis though activation of brain‑derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 in rats
was assessed. Therefore, the effect of LA on infarct size,
neurological deficit score (NDS) and brain water content
were investigated. In addition, to examine the mechanisms
activated by LA, oxidative parameters, including malondialdehyde (MDA), NO and total antioxidant capacity (T‑AOC),
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the expression of cleaved
caspase‑3, BDNF, PI3K, p‑Akt and p‑ERK1/2 proteins were
measured in rat brains.
Materials and methods
Animals and drug administration. Adult male Sprague‑Dawley
rats, 10‑12 weeks old, weighing 250‑280 g, were purchased
from the Animal Center of Southern Medical University
(Guangzhou, China). All protocols were approved by the
animal care committee of Southern Medical University and
undertaken according to the guidelines for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health
(Bethesda, MD, USA). The rats were kept under constant
laboratory conditions (20‑25˚C, 60±5% humidity) and a 12 h
light/dark cycle. They were allowed free access to food and
water up until 12 h prior to surgery at which point only water
was available.
LA powder (Shanghai Modern Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
Shanghai, China) was mixed with sterile saline. Subsequently,
1 M NaOH was added until the suspension dissolved. The pH
was lowered to 7.4 using hydrochloric acid (14). Rats were
administered with LA or saline via subcutaneous injection 2 h
prior to MCAO (15).
Experimental groups. In preliminary experiments, different
dosages of LA were administered to determine the optimal
dosage. Rats were randomly assigned to the following
groups (n=6): i) Sham group; ii) I/R group, wherein the
animals received I/R and a vehicle treatment; iii) LA group, in
which the rats received I/R and LA (50 mg/kg); iv) LA group,
in which the rats received I/R and LA (70 mg/kg); v) LA
group, in which the rats received I/R and LA (100 mg/kg).
Following determining 100 mg/kg as the optimal dosage,
rats were randomly divided into the following groups (n=9):
i) Sham group; ii) I/R group, in which the rats received I/R and
a vehicle treatment; iii) LA group, wherein the rats received
I/R and LA (100 mg/kg).
Establishment of the MCAO model. Rats fasted overnight, but
were allowed free access to water prior to the MCAO procedure. MCAO was induced as described previously (16). Briefly,
rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3.5 ml/kg) by
intraperitoneal injection. The skin and surrounding fur were
disinfected with 75% ethyl alcohol. Following incision to the

skin, the left common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and
carefully separated from the vagal nerves. The left external
carotid artery (ECA) and the left internal carotid artery (ICA)
were carefully isolated and the ECA was ligated. In addition,
the CCA was temporally occluded with 3‑0 silk thread. The
left MCA was occluded for 90  min with a paraffin‑coated
nylon filament (17), which was introduced into the ICA for
18‑20 mm until resistance was detected. After 90 min of
occlusion, the ECA was permanently occluded. The silk thread
occluding the CCA was removed for reperfusion for 24 h. A
heating lamp was used to maintain body temperature at 37˚C
during surgery.
Determination of infarct size and neurological function. After
90 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion animals
were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3.5 ml/kg) and
decapitated. The brains were quickly removed and frozen
at ‑20˚C for 20 min, dissected into 2 mm coronal slices and
immediately incubated in 2% 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Mbchem, Shanghai, China) at 37˚C for 10 min
as described previously (16). Following TTC staining, the
normal brain tissue was dark red, whereas infarcted tissue
was unstained. Following TTC staining, the tissues were then
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Mbchem) for 24 h and scanned
with a digital camera (Canon, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Infarct size
was calculated using Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) by an individual blinded to
the identity of the experimental groups and the result was
expressed as a percentage of infarct area to total brain area.
Neurological deficit evaluations were performed at the end
of the experiment by an observer masked to the identity of
experimental groups using the following criteria as previously
described (16): 0, no neurologic deficit or normal function; 1,
failure to extend right forepaw fully; 2, circling to right; 3,
leaning to right; 4, absence of spontaneous motor activity.
Therefore, a higher score was associated with poorer neurological function.
Measurement of brain water content. Brain water content
was measured as described previously (18). Briefly, after 24 h
of reperfusion animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate (3.5 ml/kg) and decapitated. The brains were rinsed
with saline and separated into ischemic and non‑ischemic
hemispheres, then immediately weighed to gain the wet
weight (WW). The brains were placed in an oven at 100˚C
for 24 h and weighed to obtain the dry weight (DW). The
brain water content (%) was measured using the following
formula: (WW ‑ DW) / WW x 100%.
Measurement of the oxidative parameters MDA, NO, T‑AOC
and SOD. After 24 h of reperfusion, animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3.5 ml/kg) and decapitated.
The rat brains were quickly removed and detached, then rinsed
with cold saline. The brains were then homogenized in cold
saline (1:10, wt/vol) and centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 min
to prepare tissue homogenate. The levels of MDA, NO and the
activities of T‑AOC and SOD were determined using commercially available assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Western blotting. Animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate (3.5 ml/kg) and decapitated 24 h after reperfusion.
The rat brains were quickly removed and detached, then
rinsed with cold saline. Tissue samples were lysed in ice‑cold
RIPA buffer (Nanjing Keygen Biotech, Co., Ltd., Nanjing,
China) containing 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1%
phosphatase inhibitors and 0.1% protease inhibitor with a
glass homogenizer on ice, repeated for 5 min and incubated
on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 20 min
at 4˚C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at ‑80˚C.
Protein concentration was measured using the BCA kit (Pierce
Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). The protein (30 µg)
was then separated on 8‑15% polyacrylamide SDS gels and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The
membranes were treated with blocking solution (5% non‑fat
dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris‑buffered saline
with Tween® 20 and incubated at room temperature for 2 h.
Following this, the membranes were incubated with a rabbit
anti‑rat polyclonal cleaved caspase‑3 antibody (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), a rabbit anti‑rat
polyclonal BDNF antibody (1:1,000; Chemicon, Temecula,
CA, USA), a rabbit anti‑rat polyclonal PI3K antibody (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), a rabbit anti‑rat polyclonal
p‑Akt antibody (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.)
and a rabbit anti‑rat polyclonal p‑ERK1/2 antibody (1:2,000;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 4˚C overnight, followed by
incubation with the corresponding goat anti‑rabbit secondary
antibodies (Wuhan Boster Bio‑Engineering Co., Ltd., Wuhan,
China) at room temperature for 1 h. GADPH was used as a
control to ensure equal protein loading. The blots were visualized with ECL‑Plus reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) and
the exposures were transferred to radiographic films. The
radiographic films were scanned by a cannon scanner (Canon,

Inc.) and analyzed using Image J software (National Institutes
of Health).
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0
software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and are expressed
as the mean  ±  standard deviation. Statistical analysis was
performed by one‑way analysis of variance and P<0.05 was
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
LA attenuates infarct size. The experimental procedure is
shown in Fig. 1A. In order to investigate the effect of LA
on infarct size, the brain infarct area was analyzed by TCC
staining after 24 h of reperfusion. There was no infarct area
in the sham rat brain (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with 100 mg/kg
LA significantly reduced total infarct size by 51.3% compared
with ischemic rats with vehicle treatment from 26.9±1.7% to
13.8±1.4% (P<0.05), while 50 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg did not
reveal a significant effect (26.9±2.1% and 24.1±2.3%, respectively; Fig. 1C). Therefore, 100 mg/kg LA was selected as the
optimum dosage for further investigation.
LA improves neurological function. As shown in Fig. 2A, 24 h
after reperfusion, the neurological score was 3.17±0.41 in the
I/R group, while this significantly decreased following treatment with LA (100 mg/kg) to 1.83±0.41 (P<0.05), however, 50
and 70 mg/kg LA did not have a significant effect (3.0±0.63
and 2.5±0.55, respectively).
LA ameliorates brain edema. Brain water content was quantified using the dry‑wet weight method and the result is shown
in Fig. 2B. The brain water content in the ischemic area of the

I/R group was significantly higher than that of the sham group.
Pretreatment of rats with 100 mg/kg LA significantly reduced
brain edema in the rats that underwent I/R (82.1±0.5% vs.
80.3±0.6%; P<0.05).
LA improves the oxidative parameters MDA, NO, T‑AOC and
SOD. As shown in Fig. 3, the content of MDA and NO significantly increased in the I/R group (P<0.05) compared with that
in the sham group and decreased in the LA‑pretreated group

(P<0.05). The activities of T‑AOC and SOD were significantly
higher in the LA‑treated group (P<0.05) than in the I/R group.
LA suppresses caspase‑independent apoptosis. Cleaved
caspase‑3, activated from caspase‑3, has been identified as
a key mediator of apoptosis and is considered to be one of
the final steps in cell apoptosis (19,20). As shown in Fig. 4,
LA significantly suppressed the level of cleaved caspase‑3
compared with the I/R group (P<0.05).

LA upregulates the expression of BDNF, PI3K, p‑Akt and
p‑ERK1/2. The expression of BDNF, PI3K, p‑Akt and
p‑ERK1/2 were examined using western blotting (Fig. 5A). As
shown in Fig. 5B, compared with the I/R group, LA significantly increased the level of BDNF and p‑Akt (P<0.05). The
results demonstrated that the levels of PI3K and p‑ERK1/2 were
significantly downregulated following cerebral I/R, however,
pretreatment with LA was able to reverse this effect and increase
the expression of these proteins (Fig. 5C‑E; P<0.05).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that pretreatment with LA has
protective effects against neuronal injury caused by cerebral
I/R in rats. Therefore, as a preventive agent, LA is beneficial
to cerebral I/R‑induced injury. This finding is consistent with
previous studies on the beneficial effects of LA against cerebral ischemia (21,22).
The results demonstrated that the optimal dose of LA was
100 mg/kg. This was not in accordance with a previous study
in which only 5 mg/kg LA had the capacity to protect against
cerebral I/R‑induced injury (22). This difference may be due
to the fact that the time period of cerebral I/R is longer in the
present study (30 min of ischemia followed by 5.5 h of reperfusion vs. 90 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion),
leading to a more severe neuronal injury. Therefore, a higher
dose of LA (100 mg/kg) is required to protect against cerebral
I/R‑induced injury.
Oxidative stress, is the main pathological process of cerebral I/R injury due to the balance between the formation and
elimination of ROS, including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide
and peroxynitrite (23). The increased concentration of ROS
can cause cellular damage and subsequent cell death since
ROS may oxidize crucial cellular components, including

lipids, proteins and DNA (24). The levels of MDA and NO
increased indicating that severe oxidative damage was caused
by I/R (25). It has been reported that LA has the capability
to scavenge MDA and NO within brain tissue (26). In the
present study, pretreatment with LA decreased the levels of
MDA and NO in rat brains. The endogenous antioxidant
enzymes, including SOD and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase
and low‑molecular weight ROS scavengers, including GSH,
are critical in attenuating the injury induced by I/R (25,27).
In the present study, LA enhanced the activities of T‑AOC
and SOD in rat brains. These data provided further evidence
that LA could inhibit I/R‑induced oxidative stress, which may
contribute to the attenuation of I/R‑induced injury.
Apoptosis has a critical pathogenic role in I/R injury. Cleaved
caspase‑3, which is activated from caspase‑3, is an important

3664

molecule involved in apoptosis in I/R injury (28). It is reported
that activation of caspase‑3 at the final execution phase of apoptosis leads to DNA fragmentation and cell death (29). It was
observed that the level of cleaved caspase‑3 markedly increased
in the brain following cerebral I/R indicating extensive apoptosis caused by I/R. The present data indicated that pretreatment
with LA reversed the increased level of cleaved caspase‑3. The
result suggested that LA had anti‑apoptotic capacity, which was
beneficial to cerebral I/R‑induced injury.
BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family and is
important in neuronal survival, differentiation, axon growth,
dendritic spine development and synaptic plasticity. When a
neuron is damaged, BDNF performs a variety of biological
effects, including preventing cell death in damaged neurons,
improving the pathological state of neurons and promoting
the regeneration of damaged neurons (30). In the case of
cerebral I/R, BDNF may protect neurons (31‑33). BDNF
can activate the TrkB receptor, leading to the activation of
several intracellular signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt
and RAS/ERK pathways (34). The PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2
signaling pathways are important in regulating cell growth,
proliferation and apoptosis (35‑37). Numerous studies have
reported that the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2
pathways are markedly associated with protection from
cerebral I/R injury (38,39). Akt, which is a direct downstream target of PI3K when phosphorylated can suppress
apoptosis by activation of anti‑apoptotic substrates, including
B‑cell lymphoma 2 family members and inhibition of
pro‑apoptotic substrates, including cytochrome c (40). When
cells suffer ischemic insults, the phosphorylation of Akt
may have a protective effect (41). ERK1/2 is a member of
the mitogen‑activated protein kinase superfamily that can
mediate cell proliferation and apoptosis (42). The activation
of ERK1/2 and subsequent downstream signaling targets, is
important in ROS‑mediated cell death (43). In the present
study, it was demonstrated that LA significantly increased
the level of BDNF. The results revealed that expression of
PI3K and p‑Akt was significantly downregulated in brains
following cerebral I/R, while LA could reverse this situation and increase the levels of PI3K and p‑Akt. In addition,
the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 increased with administration of LA. The results suggested that LA pretreatment
provided protective effects against cerebral I/R‑induced
injury possibly by promoting the BDNF‑PI3K/Akt‑ERK1/2
signaling pathway.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LA
could afford protection against cerebral I/R‑induced injury
by attenuation of oxidative stress and caspase‑dependent
apoptosis. Furthermore, the results suggest that administration of LA induces a neuroprotective effect in association
with the activation of the BDNF‑PI3K/Akt‑ERK1/2 signaling
pathway.
