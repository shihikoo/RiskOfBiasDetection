ABSTRACT: Chemokine receptor 4 and stromal-cell-derived factor 1 have been
found to be related to the initiation of neuroinﬂammation in ischemic brain.
Herein, we aimed to monitor the changes of neuorinﬂammation after AMD3100
treatment using a translocator protein (TSPO) speciﬁc PET tracer in a mouse
model of stroke. The transient MCAO model was established with Balb/C mice.
The success of the model was conﬁrmed by magnetic resonance imaging and
FDG PET. The treatment started the same day after surgery via daily
intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of AMD3100/kg for three consecutive days.
[18F]DPA-714 was used as the TSPO imaging tracer. In vivo PET was performed
at diﬀerent time points after surgery in both control and treated mice. Ex vivo
histological and immunoﬂuorescence staining of brain slices was performed to
conﬁrm the lesion site and inﬂammatory cell activation. The TSPO level was also
evaluated using Western blotting. Longitudinal PET scans revealed that the level of [18F]DPA-714 uptake was signiﬁcantly
increased in the ischemic brain area with a peak accumulation at around day 10 after surgery, and the level of uptake remained
high until day 16. The in vivo PET data were consistent with those from ex vivo immunoﬂuorescence staining. After AMD3100
treatment, the signal intensity was signiﬁcantly decreased compared with that of normal saline-treated control group. In
conclusion, TSPO-targeted PET imaging using [18F]DPA-714 can be used to monitor inﬂammatory response after stroke and
provide a useful method for evaluating the eﬃcacy of anti-inﬂammation treatment.

inﬂammation and neuromodulation.8 After experimental stroke,
the level of expression of SDF-1 is elevated for several days and
closely associated with the inﬁltration of CXCR4-expressing
cells.9 When ischemic injury happens, the level of expression of
SDF-1 is elevated in the peri-infarct and infarct region.10 This
phenomenon appears to be related to the initiation of a cascade
of events leading to neuroinﬂammation, such as local microglia
activation and peripheral monocyte and leukocyte migration to
the central neural system (CNS) against a SDF-1 concentration
gradient.11−15 In view of this, the SDF-1 pathway has been
proposed to be an attractive pharmacological target for
modulating the recruitment of immune cells into the ischemic
territory and improving functional recovery after stroke. Indeed,
Ruscher et al.16 found that inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4
pathway with AMD3100, a speciﬁc antagonist of CXCR4,
suppresses the invasion of the ischemic territory by peripheral

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in
the world. Each year, ∼100000 people experience a new or
recurrent stroke.1 Although the pathologic mechanisms of the
life-threatening disease are still not clear, it has been well
accepted that neuroinﬂammation is a key component of the
pathogenic cascade after ischemic damage in the brain.2
Although the activated glia cells can encapsulate the infarct or
enhance neuronal plasticity,3,4 lymphocyte inﬁltration is
detrimental because of the hampering of axonal growth.5
Indeed, the inﬂammatory response during the brain remodeling
period after injury is considered to be a negative factor for the
regenerative process. The long-lasting neuroinﬂammation
induced by Wallerian degeneration in local infarction, the
remote area, and the connecting ﬁbers could further lead to the
loss of brain function.4 Therefore, anti-inﬂammatory strategies
have been adopted to improve stroke outcome.6,7
Chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and stromal-cell-derived
factor 1 (SDF-1) are constitutively expressed by microglia and
astrocytes in both developing and mature central neural
systems (CNSs). This pathway has a recognized role in brain

surgery. A midline skin incision was made at the neck region
followed by careful exposure of the external, internal, and
common carotid arteries (ECA, ICA, and CCA, respectively).
One silicone-coated 6-0 MCAO suture (602356PK10, Doccol
MCAO suture) was gently advanced into the ICA to block the
blood ﬂow of the middle cerebral artery for 60 min. After that,
the suture was moved out for reperfusion of the ischemic brain
area. Sham-treated controls underwent artery exposure without
suture insertion.
For treatment, AMD3100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was
injected intraperitoneally for three consecutive days with the
ﬁrst injection performed immediately after the surgery with a
dose of 1 mg/kg/day.7 The mice in the control group were
injected with the same volume of saline.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). All MRI was
performed on a high-ﬁeld micro-MR scanner (7.0 T, Bruker,
Pharmascan) with a body coil. Mice were anesthetized with
isoﬂuorane (3.5% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) and
kept warm with a circulating water pad that covered the whole
coil. Magnetic T2-weighted images were obtained by a RARE
sequence with a respiratory-gating technology. The parameters
were as follows: TR, 3000 ms; eﬀective TE, 70 ms; NEX, 4;
matrix size, 256 × 256; FOV, 4 cm × 4 cm; and slice thickness,
1 mm.
Positron Emission Tomography and Data Analysis.
For the longitudinal study, [18F]FDG PET was performed 1, 3,
10, and 16 days after MCAO (n = 3−6), while static [18F]DPA714 imaging was performed on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, and 16 with
another group of MCAO mice (n = 4−6). Another eight mice
were used as sham controls for [18F]FDG and [18F]DPA-714
imaging. For the acquisition of static images, a single dose of
3.7 MBq (100 μCi) of [18F]FDG or [18F]DPA-714 was injected
into animals intravenously under isoﬂurane anesthesia. One
hour after the tracer had been injected, a 15 min static PET
scan was performed with a heating pad to keep anesthetized
animals warm. For the [18F]DPA-714 displacement study, a 1 h
dynamic acquisition was performed on mice 6 days after
MCAO with (n = 3) or without (n = 3) 5 mg of unlabeled
PK11195/kg administered via an intravenous catheter 30 min
after tracer injection. For the treatment study, static [18F]DPA714 imaging with the same parameters that were used in the
longitudinal study was performed on 3 and 7 days after MCAO
surgery in both the AMD3100-treated group (n = 10) and the
saline-treated control group (n = 10).
All PET images were acquired with an Inveon small animal
PET scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions). All the images
were reconstructed using a two-dimensional ordered-subset
expectation maximum algorithm (2D OSEM). Three-dimensional ellipsoidal regions of interest (ROIs) were manually
deﬁned on the ischemic region in the ipsilateral hemisphere
under the guidance of T2-weighted MR images of each mouse
obtained at the same time points of PET imaging. Another ROI
with the same shape was drawn on the corresponding region in
the contralateral brain sphere as normal background signals.
The mean pixel value of each ROI was measured with Inveon
Research Workshop software (Siemens Preclinical Solution).
The value was then converted to the concentration of
radioactivity in units of megabecquerels per milliliter. The
image-derived tissue uptake, presented as percent injected dose
per gram (%ID/g), was obtained with tissue radioactivity
divided by injected dose assuming a tissue density of 1 g/mL.33
Immunoﬂuorescence Staining. Brain cryosections with a
thickness of 8 μm were obtained using an Ultrapro 5000

immune cells, which promotes the recovery of function. In
another study, AMD3100 signiﬁcantly inhibited the inﬂammatory response and reduced the extent of blood−brain barrier
disruption after MCAO by attenuating ischemia-induced acute
inﬂammation by suppressing leukocyte migration and inﬁltration.7
The acute inﬂammatory responses consist of local microglia
activation, peripheral immune cell migration, and proinﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion, while chronic
inﬂammation in CNS is mainly characterized by angiogenesis,
glial scar formation, and nutritious cytokine secretion.2
Therefore, a better understanding of these complicated
processes will be the starting point for developing curative
treatments. Recently, PET imaging of translocator protein
(TSPO) has been investigated as a noninvasive strategy for
evaluating neuroinﬂammation.17−21 TSPO is an 18 kDa protein
that is localized at the outer mitochondrial membrane of
diﬀerent cell types.22,23 It is expressed at low levels in healthy
brain but is robustly upregulated in response to injury and
inﬂammation. In cerebral ischemia, the level of expression of
TSPO is increased in activated microglia as well as in
macrophages and neutrophils entering the brain from the
peripheral blood within the ﬁrst days after the insult.24 Among
the various radiolabeled TSPO ligands, [18F]DPA-714 shows a
comparatively high speciﬁcity and binding potential in diﬀerent
disease models such as cerebral ischemia, herpes encephalitis,
and chemically induced acute neuroinﬂammation.25−27 Studies
of [18F]DPA-714 in healthy volunteers further conﬁrm its
potential use in the diagnosis of CNS diseases and perhaps
therapeutic eﬃcacy monitoring.28
In this study, we developed a mouse MCAO model and
treated the mice that had suﬀered strokes with AMD3100 to
alleviate injury-induced neuroinﬂammation. The inﬂammatory
response was evaluated with [18F]DPA-714 PET imaging
longitudinally. We expected to identify the causal relationship
between AMD3100 treatment and the change in TSPO
expression level after stroke and investigate its potential antiinﬂammation property. The long-term goal of this study is to
apply TSPO PET imaging for optimizing the anti-inﬂammatory
intervention of ischemic brain injuries.

with Z-ﬁx solution for 15 min and then blocked with
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 0.5 h. Slices were incubated with primary
antibodies at 4 °C overnight and with secondary antibodies in a
dark area for 60 min at room temperature. After each step,
slices were washed gently three times with PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 5 min. For diﬀerent staining

Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Dylight 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and Cy3-conjugated donkey
anti-goat secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). All brain tissue slices were mounted with
medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
and then observed with an epiﬂuorescence microscope (X81;
Olympus).
Western Blot. Brain tissues were sonicated in T-per buﬀer
(Thermo scientiﬁc) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). After that, the protein suspension (40 μg) was
separated on a 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gel using sodium dodecyl
sulfate−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto
a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane. The membrane was
blocked with blocking buﬀer (Thermo scientiﬁc) for 1 h at
room temperature and incubated with speciﬁc primary antibody

RESULTS
[ F]DPA-714 PET Imaging of TSPO Expression. The
successful establishment of the MCAO model was conﬁrmed
by T 2 -weighted MRI (Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information). The high signal intensity that was observed in
brain parenchyma was recognized as ischemic area and used as
a reference to draw ROI on the corresponding PET images. A
glucose uptake defect on the infarcted site by [18F]FDG PET
can be seen on both days 1 and 3, followed by an obviously
increased level of signal uptake on day 10. On day 16, the
magnitude of the signal in the ischemic area dropped to a level
similar to that in the sham (Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information).
To evaluate TSPO overexpression in MCAO mice without
any therapeutic intervention, the longitudinal PET using
[18F]DPA-714 was performed on 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, and 16 days
after surgery. As shown in Figure 1A, starting from day 3, an
increased level of local uptake of [18F]DPA-714 in the ischemic
area was observed, which peaked around day 10, and then the
signal intensity dropped slowly until day 16. To further conﬁrm

MRI before PET imaging. As shown in Figure 1B, the fused
images clearly showed a colocalization of the region of
enhanced [18F]DPA-714 accumulation from PET and the
ischemic area identiﬁed by MRI. Obviously, a high signal
intensity can be observed on both the cortex and the basal area.

2.04 ± 0.38 on days 3, 7, and 10, respectively. After that, the
lesion-to-normal uptake ratio value dropped slightly to 1.80 ±
0.30 on day 16, which was still signiﬁcantly higher than that in
the control mice (Figure 1C).
To conﬁrm the increased signal intensity in the ischemic area
is a result of speciﬁc binding of [18F]DPA-714 to TSPO, a
displacement study with unlabeled PK11195, a competitive
TSPO ligand, was performed on three MCAO mice 6 days after
surgery. As shown in Figure 2A, within a few minutes of
injection of the tracer, the time−activity curve over the lesion
area reached a plateau and showed a very slow downslope until
60 min. Upon injection of PK11195 at 30 min during the
dynamic acquisition, the intensity of radioactivity dropped very
rapidly. ROIs over the contralateral brain tissue generated a
TAC with a much lower amplitude, and PK11195 injection
showed a much less signiﬁcant eﬀect (Figure 2A). The signal
intensity changes were also identiﬁed on PET images acquired
before and after PK11195 displacement (Figure 2B). The
amount of tracer uptake was signiﬁcantly decreased after
displacement at the lesion area [3.89 ± 0.63%ID/g vs 1.95 ±
0.77%ID/g (p < 0.05)] but not in contralateral brain tissue
[1.90 ± 0.30%ID/g vs 1.62 ± 0.80%ID/g (p > 0.05)] (Figure
2C).
Change of TSPO Expression after AMD3100 Treatment. Because AMD3100 treatment interferes with the
inﬂammatory process after ischemic brain injury, we performed
in vivo PET imaging on both treated and control mice to follow
the change in the level of TSPO. Three consecutive doses of
treatment using AMD3100 did not fully block TSPO
upregulation in the ischemic area. However, an apparently
reduced [18F]DPA-714 signal intensity and signal volume can
be seen in the AMD3100-treated group 3 days after surgery
(Figure 3A), with a lesion-to-normal ratio of 1.47 ± 0.14 versus
a value of 1.73 ± 0.17 (p < 0.05, compared with the saline only
group). On day 7, the local level of tracer uptake is still
somewhat lower in AMD3100-treated mice, but there was no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups [1.64 ± 0.17 vs
1.75 ± 0.36 (p > 0.05)] (Figure 3B).
To conﬁrm the PET ﬁndings, we collected the brain tissue
and performed a Western blot study using TSPO speciﬁc
antibodies. In normal brain tissues, there was a certain level of
TSPO expression. Three days after surgery, the TSPO level
increased dramatically and AMD3100 treatment reduced the
TSPO protein level. Seven days after surgery, the TSPO level
was still high and a decreased TSPO protein level in the
AMD3100-treated group can be observed, but to a lesser extent
(Figure 3C). To evaluate the SDF-1 expression after AMD3100
treatment, we performed a Western blot study in brain tissue
with and without AMD3100 treatment on days 3 and 7. There
was a low level of SDF-1 expression in healthy brain tissue and
a signiﬁcantly increased level of SDF-1 expression 3 and 7 days
after stroke, and the SDF-1 level was decreased after AMD3100
treatment.
Immunohistological Staining of TSPO Expression.
During neuroinﬂammation, TSPO upregulation was identiﬁed
on several types of cells, including activated microglia,
inﬁltrated neutrophils and macrophages, and astrocytes.
Accordingly, we evaluated TSPO expression on brain slices
harvested at diﬀerent time points after MCAO, and CD11b and
GFAP were chosen as markers for microglia and astrocytes,
respectively. We found that the intensity of TSPO positive cells
increased along with time with a peak appearing on day 10,
which showed a time course similar to that for in vivo PET

results (Figure 4). Costaining with CD11b and GFAP revealed
that microglia were the main cell type of TSPO positive cells at

early time points. However, local astrocytes can also overexpress TSPO at late stages of cerebral ischemia.
With AMD3100 treatment, the decreased intensity of TSPO
positive cells in ischemic mouse brain was observed on day 3.
On day 7, both treated and untreated groups presented a higher
level of TSPO positive cells, but there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the two (Figure 5A). To further diﬀerentiate the source of TSPO protein, we performed immunoﬂuorescence staining of macrophages and leukocytes. As shown
in Figure 5B, AMD3100 treatment partially inhibited the
accumulation of both macrophages and leukocytes in infarcted
brain parenchyma on day 3, and the diﬀerence was diminished
by day 7. The colocalized staining of macrophages and TSPO
was performed on brain slices harvested on day 7. TSPO is
positive for inﬁltrated macrophages after stroke but not limited
to macrophages (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

After ischemic injury in brain, the infarcted center and
surrounding edema area have an increased amount of
intracellular and extracellular water, leading to an obvious
signal change on T2-weighted MRI.40 Coregistration of
[18F]DPA-714 PET images with T2-weighted MRI could
provide anatomical reference to locate the PET signal. In
most cases, we saw a relatively good overlay of the increased
magnitude of the PET signal within the lesion site indicated by
T2-weighted MRI. However, at a late time point (day 16), the
lesion area presented on MRI images was much smaller than
the signal increased area on PET images. This may be due to
the alleviation of edema at the late stage of the injury, and T2weighted MRI is not suﬃciently sensitive to detect the lesion
site.41
The small molecule SDF-1/CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100,
has been shown to have a promising eﬀect in attenuating
ischemic injury in diﬀerent animal models such as myocardial
infarction, hindlimb ischemia, and stroke.7,16,42 The therapeutic
eﬀect of AMD3100 results from a reduction of the extent of
inﬁltration of ischemic brain parenchyma byperipheral
inﬂammatory cells. With [18F]DPA-714 PET, we observed a
signiﬁcant decrease in the magnitude of the signal after
AMD3100 treatment on day 3, indicating that AMD3100
treatment downregulated the local TSPO protein level. This
result was indeed conﬁrmed by ex vivo Western blot and
immunoﬂuorescence staining against TSPO. However, the
magnitude of the decrease in the signal intensity on PET
images did not match perfectly with that from Western blots. In
addition, the TSPO level decreased on day 7 with AMD3100
treatment on Western blot but was not detectable with PET.
We speculate that this is partially due to the small size of the
mouse brain and partial volume eﬀect of PET imaging.41 It may
also be related to the small dose of AMD3100 and the short
drug delivery period.7 A decreased SDF-1 level was also
observed after AMD3100 treatment, as shown by the Western
blot study. The exact reason is unclear and needs to be
investigated further.
Overexpression of TSPO in the ischemic brain area has been
correlated with pathophysiological heterogeneity, such as
microglia and astrocyte activation.43,44 Inﬁltrated peripheral
immune cells, such as monocytes, leukocytes, and lymphocytes,
also contribute to the overexpression of TSPO.23 The signal of
PET reﬂects the overall level of TSPO, which has no ability to
diﬀerentiate the origination of the protein. Because AMD3100
can inhibit the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway, resulting in decreased
levels of migration of macrophages and/or leukocytes, it is
highly possible that the decrease in the magnitude of the signal
on PET images is caused by a decreased number of inﬁltrated
peripheral lymphocytes. However, because of the nonspeciﬁcity
of the cell maker of these cells,45 we cannot exclude the
contribution of activated microglia and astrocytes to the PET
signal change. This is also supported by an incomplete
colocalization of macrophages and TSPO.
Because of the complexity of the neuroinﬂammatory
response after brain injury and intertwining of various cytokines
and inﬂammatory cells, the dose and timing of therapeutic
intervention would be very critical to the exertion of a beneﬁcial
eﬀect and the prevention of any detrimental consequence in
both acute and chronic phases. Although AMD3100 is
promising in the treatment of experimental stroke, further
investigation to optimize the therapy regimen is still needed for
further clinical translation. We believe the accurate evaluation

DISCUSSION
TSPO can be overexpressed on activated microglia and other
cell types when the homogeneity in CNS is broken by internal
or external factors. Hence, it has been intensively investigated
as an imaging target for monitoring the inﬂammatory responses
in diﬀerent types of brain disease, including cerebral
ischemia.18−20,27,34−38 Recently, several studies demonstrated
the protective role of AMD3100 in experimental stroke.7,16 In
particular, inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway during the
acute stage after stroke promotes long-term recovery, mainly by
depressing the extent of invasion of the ischemic territory by
peripheral immune cells.16 Therefore, for the ﬁrst time, to the
best of our knowledge, we applied [18F]DPA-714 PET in
monitoring the change in neuroinﬂammation induced by
AMD3100 treatment in a mouse brain ischemia/reperfusion
model.
Consistent with previous studies,20 the time frame of the
overexpression of TSPO can be dynamically monitored via
longitudinal PET imaging using [18F]DPA-714 as the imaging
tracer.39 The speciﬁcity of [18F]DPA-714 to TSPO was
conﬁrmed by a displacement study with a mass amount of
unlabeled PK11195. The local level of accumulation of
[18F]DPA-714 increased signiﬁcantly in ipsilateral ischemic
side starting from day 3 after surgery and reached a peak on day
10. Then the signal intensity slightly dropped on day 16. Our
study ended on day 16 after surgery instead of day 30 as in the
previous report.20 It is partially because mice are less tolerant to
brain ischemia injury than rats. The high mortality rate of the
model makes it diﬃcult for long-term observation.

of neuroinﬂammation with noninvasive imaging strategy would
accelerate this process.

■

CONCLUSIONS
TSPO-targeted PET imaging using [18F]DPA-714 can be used
to monitor the inﬂammatory response after stroke dynamically
and noninvasively. Herein, [18F]DPA-714 can be a valuable
probe for understanding the pathological process of neuroinﬂammation after stroke and provide a useful method for
evaluating the therapeutic eﬃciency of the anti-inﬂammation
treatment.
