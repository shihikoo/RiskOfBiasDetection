We measured the content of reduced aminothiols (cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione)
after mechanical occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. During acute period of ischemia (3 h), these parameters decreased by ~10 times. In 7 days, the content of reduced aminothiols in some animals remained low, but in the others surpassed the initial levels. These
results indicate significant impairment of the redox status of the circulating aminothiol pool
apparently caused by oxidative stress of the peripheral vascular endothelial occurring as a
response to cerebral ischemia. Thus, the total amount of homocysteine is considered a risk
factor for stroke, while its reduced fraction can reflect the post stroke state.

The role of hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent
risk factor of acute brain stroke is shown in numerous studies [7]. The proposed mechanisms and targets
of the pathological effects of homocysteine on blood
vessels aroused interest not only to evaluation of its
total content, but also to measurement of other forms
of homocysteine and other aminothiols [8,10,12]. The
total content and cysteine and homocysteine fractions
are increased after stroke, while changes in reduced
homocysteine are contradictory [6,15].
On the other hand, acute stroke is a stressful event
triggering the mechanisms of metabolic response in
peripheral tissues, which can affect the redox balance
and metabolism of aminothiols. Thus, early studies on
experimental model of cerebral ischemia [14] showed
increased plasma levels not only of enzyme markers
of brain damage (creatine phosphokinases, glutamate

transaminases), but also glucocorticoids, fatty acids,
triglycerides, and cholesterol within the first hours of
ischemia. Reflex release of corticosterone and hydrocortisol, probably because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system, triggers the release of lipids
from peripheral tissues, lipolysis, and steatosis [14].
Another consequence of acute stroke is a sustained
and long-term (up to 10 days) increase in BP in 1/3 of
patients [13]. The mechanism of this increase is not
fully elucidated, but it is suggested that nervous pulses
causing dysregulation of the arterial tone also play a
triggering role. It was shown that ischemia/reperfusion
of the middle cerebral artery reduced acetylcholinesterase and nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation of mesenteric arteries. In this case, elevation of plasma IL-6
and IL-1β, ROS (O2–), and nitrosylation of proteins are
also observed. All this phenomena attest to endothelial
dysfunction in peripheral vessels [11].
Despite ample data on the role of aminothiols,
primarily homocysteine, in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, there are still no data on their

involvement in the post-stroke response of peripheral organs. In this regard, it is interesting to explore
changes in the total content and redox state of plasma
aminothiols caused by cerebral ischemia.
Most methods of HPLC-UV and capillary electrophoresis (CE) with UV or mass spectrometric detectors are not sufficiently sensitive to determine reduced
homocysteine [1,3,4]. Reduced forms of aminothiols are usually assayed by highly sensitive methods:
HPLC and CE with fluorescence detectors and GCspectrometric systems [2,5]. However, some studies
showed that these compounds could be assayed with
common thiol-specific reagents, e.g. dithiodipyridine
[6] and 5,5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) [9].
Such reagents as DTNB are characterized by reversibility of action. In total aminothiol assay, DTNB
is added in large excess, therefore undesirable disulfide exchange reaction between formed TNB-thiol derivatives and thionitrobenzoate dianion makes no significant contribution to the analysis. However, during
the analysis of reduced aminothiols, this reaction and
interactions between thionitrobenzoate dianion with
thiols oxidized to disulfides lead to the accumulation
of corresponding TNB derivatives and thus distort the
results of the analysis. Therefore, to suppress the undesired thiol-disulfide interchange reactions, we used
NEM as a blocker, which covalently and irreversibly
binds the thionitrobenzoate dianion.
In this work, we modified the method of determining reduced plasma aminothiols using DTNB to study
the changes in the redox status of cysteine, homocysteine and glutathione associated with local cerebral
ischemia in rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used acetonitrile Ultra Gradient (RCI Labscan)
99.9%, NEM >98% (HPLC) (Sigma-Aldrich), DTNB,
dihydrate of 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA), phosphoric
acid, sodium citrate (dihydrate), trifluoroacetic acid
99.0% (Sigma-Aldrich), NaH2PO4·2H2O 98-100.5%
(Panreac), Na2HPO4·2H2O 98-101% (Panreac), NaOH,
EDTA disodium salt dihydrate 99% (AppliChem), Dpenicillamine P4875 (PA; Sigma), DL-dithiothreitol
>99.5% (Fluka), L-cysteine 97%, glutathione 99%
(Sigma-Aldrich), DL-homocysteine >95% (Sigma),
ethanol rectified.
The experiment was performed on adult outbred
white male rats weighing 260-300 g. The operations
were performed under general anesthesia (chloral hydrate intraperitoneally at a dose of 300 mg/kg). To measure systemic BP and blood sampling, both femoral
arteries were isolated and cannulated (heparin intraarterially, 500 U/kg). The head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame. To register the blood flow with a cylindri-

cal sensor, the parietal bone was trephined (5×3 mm)
without impairing dura mater integrity (coordinates:
AP, 5 mm; L, 3 mm). Blood flow was recorded and
spectral wavelet analysis of blood flow oscillations
was performed using blood flow analyzer LAKK-02
(version 2.2.0.507; LAZMA). Recording was started
30 min after surgery completion at the ambient temperature of 20 to 21oC.
Control blood samples were taken 7 days before
surgery. The blood was collected after 3 hours and 7
days after surgery.
Focal cerebral ischemia was reproduced using the
middle cerebral artery occlusion. Surgical 4-00 polypropylene thread (22 mm long; Ethicon) treated with
silicone and poly-L-lysine was inserted retrogradely
into the left external carotid artery and then carried
through the bifurcation of the common carotid artery
and the internal carotid artery to the mouth of the
middle cerebral artery blocking it.
Venous blood was collected into tubes with sodium citrate and centrifuged at 3000g for 3 min. The
plasma for total thiol assay was collected, frozen at
-20oC, and stored until analysis.
To determine reduced thiols, 900 μl blood plasma
was added to 225 μl 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) solution (230 g/liter) immediately after isolation. The
samples were mixed thoroughly, frozen, and stored at
-80oC. Before derivatization, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000g; 100 μl 10 mM DTNB
in 0.4 M Na-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented
with 5 mM EDTA-Na, 50 μl 25 μM internal standard
(TNB-derivative of PA), 500 μl of plasma supernatant
and 95 μl 1.5 M NaOH were added sequentially to the
test tube. The sample was vigorously shaken for 5 sec,
then 50 μl 100 mM NEM was added and after 30-sec
stirring, 50 μl 300 g/liter SSA was added.
Total thiols were assayed as described previously [3].
The components were separated using an Agilent
Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 mm×4.6 mm, 5 μ) and
Agilent Hypersil BDS-C18 (150 mm×4.6 mm, 5 μ)
serially connected. The temperature of the columns was
maintained at 35oC, that of eluent at 24oC. Injection
volume was about 500 μl (injector loop was completely
filled). The flow rate of the liquid phase was 0.5 ml/
min. Eluent A: 0.04% TFA in 0.2 M Na-phosphate buffer (pH 6.6); eluent B: acetonitrile. Direct B gradient
elution occurred for 14 min from 4.5 to 9.3%, columns
were washed for 3 min with 50% B, followed by a linear decrease of B from 50 to 4.5% for 1 min. Then the
columns were regenerated for 10 min at 4.5% B. The
absorption signal was determined at 330 nm.
Primary processing (integration of chromatographic peaks) was performed with Perkin Elmer TotalChrom 6.2; calibration curves were generated by Mi-

crosoft Excel. To determine the concentration of aminothiols, the ratio of the areas of the analyte and the
internal standard was used. The signal was calibrated
by the analysis of plasma samples with addition of a
known amount of the analytes and regression analysis.

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows a blood plasma chromatogram after sequential treatment with DTNB and NEM. Elution time
for TNB derivatives of cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, and PA was 8.1, 11.3, 14.5, and 20.7 min, respectively. Retention time variation was from 3 to 5%. The
detection limits of the analytes were 0.1 μM (s/n=4).
Cerebral blood flow is reduced by half 3 hours
after middle cerebral artery occlusion, on average to
18.0±1.9 perfusion units (p<0.05), which can be interpreted as autoregulatory failure. In this case, increased
normalized amplitude of blood flow oscillations was
in endothelial and neurogenic ranges, 2.6±0.3 and
2.6±0.5, respectively (p<0.05).
After occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, the
level of reduced thiols was sharply reduced, this effect
was most pronounced for glutathione (Table 1). Blood
sampling repeated after 7 days showed increased content of reduced aminothiols above the initial level in
some rats and low values of this parameter in others.
There was a clear correlation between reduced homocysteine and reduced cysteine and the slopes of the
corresponding lines were similar (Fig. 2).
These changes indicate that reduced aminothiols
react as a single pool; therefore, their unidirectional
changes most likely can be attributed not to pathways
of synthesis, transport, and decay specific for each
compound, but to sensitivity to oxidants, such as H2O2,
O2–, ONOO– characteristic of the whole group. Oxidation can become irreversible depending on the severity
of oxidative stress and under certain conditions analysis of total aminothiols will not reflect this process.
Simulation of local cerebral ischemia led to acute
and significant reduction in reduced plasma aminothiols including homocysteine. This demonstrates functional heterogeneity of its total content (risk factor for
stroke) and reduced fraction (substance modulated by
stroke). Since this fraction is the most labile and sensi-

tive to changes in redox potential of the medium, it is
likely that these changes are associated with the appearance of active oxidant molecules in the plasma, such
as ROS and NO, which are formed during oxidative
stress of peripheral vascular endothelium in response to
cerebral ischemia. It was also shown that these changes
persisted in some animals, while in others, the level
of reduced thiols was equal or surpassed the baseline,
which may indicate individual differences.
