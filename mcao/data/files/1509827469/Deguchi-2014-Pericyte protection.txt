Pericytes play a pivotal role in contraction, mediating
inflammation and regulation of blood flow in the brain. In
this study, changes of pericytes in the neurovascular unit
(NVU) were examined in relation to the effects of exogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and a free radical
scavenger, edaravone. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses showed that the overlap between
platelet-derived growth factor receptor b-positive pericytes and N-acetylglucosamine oligomers (NAGO)-positive endothelial cells increased significantly at 4 days
after 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO). The number of pericytes and the overlap with
NAGO decreased with tPA but recovered with edaravone
4 days after tMCAO with proliferation. Thus, tPA treatment damaged pericytes, resulting in the detachment
from astrocytes and a decrease in glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor secretion. However, treatment with
edaravone greatly improved tPA-induced damage to pericytes. The present study demonstrates that exogenous
tPA strongly damages pericytes and destroys the integrity of the NVU, but edaravone treatment can greatly
ameliorate such damage after acute cerebral ischemia
in rats. VC 2014 The Authors. Journal of Neuroscience Research

Ischemic brain damage can be effectively ameliorated if cerebral blood flow (CBF) is restored by
thrombolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), within a short space of time (Group, 1997).
Although the ECASS III trial showed that the therapeutic time frame of intravenous thrombolysis with
tPA for acute ischemic stroke was extended from 3 hr
to 4.5 hr after the onset of symptoms, the trial simultaneously showed that tPA was more frequently associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (Hacke
et al., 2008). Endogenous tPA is a major parenchymal
serine protease in the brain that regulates physiological
tissue remodeling and plasticity (Tsirka et al., 1997;
Gravanis and Tsirka, 2005). However, a high dose of

exogenous tPA could also cause hemorrhagic transformation by disturbing the neurovascular unit (NVU;
Yamashita et al., 2009) and by direct neurotoxicity
(Lukic-Panin et al., 2010), presenting a threat to the
safe use for thrombolytic therapy.
Recently, brain pericytes have received increasing
attention in various neurological disorders, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and diabetic retinopathy
(Hamilton et al., 2010). Brain pericytes are present in isolated preparations in the ratio of one pericyte per three
brain capillary endothelial cells (Pardridge, 1999). Brain
pericytes have functional properties consisting of contraction, mediation of inflammation, and regulation of endothelial cell activity (Nag, 2003). Yemisci et al. (2009)
showed that ischemia induces sustained contraction of
pericytes on microvessels in the intact mouse brain and
that suppression of oxidative–nitrative stress relieved pericyte contraction.
Our previous study showed a marked dissociation
between the basement membrane and astrocyte foot
processes in the peri-ischemic lesion with tPA, which
was improved by the addition of the free radical scavenger edaravone (Yamashita et al., 2009). The present
study focuses on the relationship between NVU pericytes in association with a neuroprotective effect and
angiogenesis and the effects of tPA and edaravone

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Focal Cerebral Ischemia
All experimental protocols and procedures were
approved by the Animal Committee of the Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry. Adult male
Wistar rats (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan), 12 weeks old (body
weight 250–280 g), were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of pentobarbital (10 mg/250 g). A burr hole
(2 mm in diameter) was carefully made in the skull to measure
the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), with the dura mater
preserved at this time. The location of the burr hole was
3 mm dorsal and 5 mm lateral to the right from bregma,
which is located in the upper part of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) territory.
On the following day, an inhalation mask was used to
anesthetize the animals with a mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane (69%/30%/1%) during surgical preparation.
Body temperature was monitored and maintained at
37 C 6 0.3 C by using a heating pad during the surgical procedure. The right MCA was occluded by insertion of a 4-0 surgical nylon thread with silicon coating through the common
carotid artery, as described by Abe et al. (1992). After 90 min of
tMCAO, the nylon thread was gently removed to restore blood
flow in the MCA territory. Vehicle (physiologic saline [PS],
i.v., 0.5 ml) or edaravone (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Osaka,
Japan; i.v., 3 mg/kg in 0.5 ml PS) was injected twice at the
beginning of transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, followed by vehicle (i.v., 0.5 ml PS) or tPA (Grtpa; Mitsubishi
Tanabe Pharma; i.v., 10 mg/kg in 0.5 ml PS) at the time of
reperfusion. This dose of tPA was selected based on the report
of a tenfold difference in fibrin-specific activity between
humans and rodents (Korninger and Collen, 1981). The incision was then closed. Sham control (SC) animals were incised
simultaneously, but the incision was closed without inserting
the thread. rCBF of the right frontoparietal cortex region was
measured before, during, and after tMCAO through the burr
hole by using a laser blood flowmeter (Flo-C1; Omegawave,
Tokyo, Japan), as described previously (Kitagawa et al., 1999).
After the incision was closed, the animals were allowed to
recover at ambient temperature until sampling, with free access
to water and food.
After reperfusion, rats were decapitated under deep anesthesia by i.p. injection of pentobarbital (20 mg/250 g) at each
time point for the experimental groups. The brains were
removed quickly, frozen immediately in powdered dry ice, and
stored at 280 C until use. Coronal sections 12 lm thick at the
caudate level were made by using a cryostat at 218 C and
mounted onto silane-coated glass slides.
Experimental Groups and Drug Treatment
Rats were sacrificed at 1, 4, and 14 days after reperfusion (each group; n 5 5), including the SC (n 5 5), to investigate, by immunohistochemistry, the chronological changes
to pericytes after 90 min of tMCAO. Next, another set of
rats was divided into four groups to investigate the effect of

tPA and edaravone on pericytes. The V 1 V control group
(n 5 5) received only the vehicle twice at the beginning and
end of tMCAO, followed by the same vehicle at reperfusion. The V 1 tPA group (n 5 5) received a similar vehicle
treatment twice during tMCAO, followed by tPA treatment
at reperfusion. The E 1 V group (n 5 5) received edaravone
at the beginning and end of tMCAO, followed by the vehicle at reperfusion. The E 1 tPA group (n 5 5) received
edaravone twice, followed by tPA treatment at reperfusion.
Edaravone was injected twice because of its short half-life
(T1/2 5 5.4 min; Watanabe et al., 1994) and because free
radicals are generated during and after cerebral ischemia
(Abe et al., 1988). These rats were simultaneously sacrificed
at 4 days after reperfusion when the expression of the pericytic marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor b
(PDGFRb) had peaked.

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
To determine the area of ischemic lesions affected by tPA
and edaravone at 4 days after tMCAO, brain sections were
stained with hematoxylin–eosin staining and examined with a
light microscope (SZX-12; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).
Sections were made at 2, 0, 22, 24, and 26 mm from bregma.
The infarct area was measured in these five sections by counting
pixels in Photoshop CS5, and infarct volume was calculated by
multiplying the infarct area by 2 mm thickness (Kawai et al.,
2011).
Double immunohistochemical analysis was performed
between PDGFRb and N-acetylglucosamine oligomers
(NAGO), Ki67, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to analyze the
pericytes surrounding the endothelial cells. Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEL) is a glycoprotein with positive affinity for
NAGO that is expressed in mature vascular endothelial cells
(Deguchi et al., 2006). PDGFRb, Ki67, and GFAP are markers
of pericyte cells, proliferating cells, and differentiated astroglial
cells, respectively. GDNF has been identified as a potent neurotrophic factor that enhances the survival of neurons (Abe et al.,
1997).
Frozen brain sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4) for 10 min and
rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). After
blocking of the nonspecific reaction with 5% bovine serum
albumin solution for 2 hr at room temperature, the brain sections were incubated with rabbit anti-PDGFRb antibody
(1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), biotinylated LEL (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), goat
anti-Ki67 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), mouse anti-GFAP (1:500; Millipore, Temecula
CA), or goat anti-GDNF antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 C. Slides were washed with PBS,
then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey antirabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR), streptavidin
DyLight 488 conjugate (1:200; Vector Laboratories), or Alexa
Fluor 555-labeled donkey anti-mouse and goat IgG (1:200;
Invitrogen) for 2 hr at room temperature. The slides were
washed in PBS, then covered with Vectashield mounting

medium with 40 ,60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories).
The treated sections were scanned with a confocal
microscope equipped with an argon and HeNe laser (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Sets of fluorescent images
were acquired sequentially for the red and green channels to
prevent the crossover of signals from green to red or from red
to green channels. A set of sections was stained in a similar
way without primary antibodies to confirm the specificity of
the primary antibody. Photoshop CS5 was used to measure
the area of vascular endothelial cells from NAGO staining,
whereas the area of pericytes was estimated from PDGFb
staining in the same region of double immunohistochemical
staining. The coverage ratio of pericyte area to endothelial cell
area was then calculated.

RESULTS
CBF
rCBF immediately dropped to less than 30% of the
basal level after MCAO. After reperfusion, rCBF quickly
recovered to about 90% of the basal level in all experimental groups, as previously described (Zhang et al.,
2000). There were no significant differences in rCBF
between all groups throughout the tMCAO experiments
(data not shown).
Chronological Change of Pericyte
Color panels in Figure 1 show the peri-ischemic
brain regions. PDGFRb-positive pericyte (red) partially
overlapped (merged, yellow) with NAGO-positive endothelial cells (green). The coverage of PDGFRb-positive
pericytes with NAGO-positive endothelial cells was significantly reduced at 1 day after tMCAO (54.0% 6 2.2%,
P < 0.01 vs. SC) compared with that of SC
(61.7% 6 2.7%) and then increased significantly at 4 days
(69.9% 6 1.3%, P < 0.01 vs. SC; Fig. 1B).
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) showed that
PDGFRb (210 kDa) levels of the peri-ischemic regions
decreased slightly at 1 and 2 days after reperfusion; nevertheless, they increased significantly more than levels of the
peri-ischemic regions in the SC group from 4 days, with
a gradual decrease until 28 days (P < 0.05 vs. SC at 4 days
and 7 days).

Western Blot Analysis
For Western blot analysis, 90 min of tMCAO was
performed in a different set of animals, which were decapitated under deep anesthesia by i.p. administration of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days after
reperfusion (each group, n 5 5). The brains were removed,
and the peri-ischemic region of the cerebral cortices (about
100 mg) was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. These brain
tissue samples were sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 250 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, and the Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were
determined by the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA).
Total protein extract (20 lg) was loaded onto an 8%
polyacrylamide gel, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore).
The membranes were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, containing
4% skim milk and 1% Tween 20, then incubated overnight at
4 C with rabbit anti-PDGFRb antibody (1:1,000 dilution in
skimmed milk). The membranes were washed with PBS, then
probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody, and immunodetection was performed with an
enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). After the detection of ECL, membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2%
SDS, 0.7% b-mercaptoethanol) at 50 C for 10 min, then
reprobed with a monoclonal anti-b-tubulin antibody
(1:5,000; Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) as a loading control for protein quantification. The signals were quantified with a luminoimage analyzer (LAS 1000-Mini; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan),
and quantitative densitometric analysis was performed in
ImageJ.

Cerebral Infarct Volume With or Without
Edaravone and tPA
The V 1 tPA group showed a small and nonsignificant increase in infarct size. In contrast, infarct volume
decreased significantly in the E 1 V group compared with
in the V 1 V and V 1 tPA groups. The E 1 tPA group also
showed lower infarct volume compared with the V 1 tPA
group but not the V 1 V group. These results were
described in a previous article (Deguchi et al., 2012).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical differences in pericyte coverage by endothelial
cells, the number of Ki67-positive cells, and the results of Western blot analysis among the four groups were evaluated using
one-way ANOVA with a post hoc test. Statistical significance
was assumed at P < 0.05.

Change in Pericyte Coverage With Edaravone and
tPA
As shown in Figure 3, the area of PDGFRbpositive pericyte overlap, or coverage, was significantly
reduced in the V 1 tPA group (62.9% 6 4.2%, P < 0.05)
compared with in the V 1 V group (68.9 6 2.6%).

the interendothelial junctions (Shepro and Morel, 1993).
The endothelial coverage ratio by pericytes was 30–80%
in brain regions and did not vary in the cerebral cortex,
caudate, or hippocampus (Armulik et al., 2010; Bell et al.,
2010; Daneman et al., 2010; Dalkara et al., 2011). The
coverage of pericytes was 61.7% 6 2.7% before cerebral
ischemia (Fig. 1), confirming previous reports. In addition, this study shows a decrease of endothelial coverage
by pericytes at 1 day after tMCAO (Fig. 1), which then
increased significantly as the number of Ki67 doublepositive pericytes increased at 4 days after ischemia (Fig.
2). These results might correspond to the first step of
angiogenesis in which pericytes degenerate and detach
from the base membrane to form a new vessel (Hayashi
et al., 2006; Duz et al., 2007; Yemisci et al., 2009). Arimura et al. (2012) revealed that the expression of
PDGFRb increased gradually over the 5 days following
permanent MCAO in vascular walls in peri-infarct areas.
Bone marrow-derived cells may also play a crucial role as
a source of pericytes in vessel maturation after cerebral
ischemia (Kokovay et al., 2006).
In the present study, administration of tPA
decreased both pericyte coverage and PDGFRb protein
expression at 4 days after tMCAO (Fig. 3). A small
amount of endogenous tPA is normally produced in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells of the
rodent brain (Tsirka et al., 1997; Schreiber et al., 1998;
Kim et al., 2006; Xin et al., 2010). This tPA is secreted

DISCUSSION
The role of pericytes, which encircle capillary vessels, is
remarkably important for the maturation and stabilization
of capillary vessels during angiogenesis. Ischemia and
reperfusion-induced injury may impair microcirculatory
reflow, which negatively affects the survival of pericytes
(Yemisci et al., 2009). The present study demonstrates
that the coverage of endothelial cells by pericytes in the
peri-ischemic brain regions is transiently reduced shortly
after transient ischemia and then increased, peaking at 4–7
days with a gradual return until 28 days (Fig. 1). This
study also shows that coverage of the pericytes is significantly reduced by intravenous administration of tPA but
can be recovered with edaravone (Fig. 3). In addition,
this study demonstrates that intravenous administration of
tPA induces the detachment of astrocyte endfeet surrounding the pericytes in parts of vessels in peri-ischemic
brain regions, although edaravone recovered this condition (Fig. 5).
Endothelial coverage by pericytes varies among
organs and is correlated with the degree of tightness of

into the extracellular space (Samson and Medcalf, 2006)
and is regulated by neuroserpin and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; Lawrence et al., 1990; Yepes and
Lawrence, 2004). By means of this mechanism, tPA physiologically modulates learning (Seeds et al., 2003), synaptic plasticity (Krystosek and Seeds, 1981), cell death
(Tsirka et al., 1997), and permeability of the NVU (Polavarapu et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008). In addition, pericytes regulate coagulation and fibrinolysis by releasing
PAI-1 and antithrombotic serpin protease nexin-1 (Kim
et al., 2006). However, a high dose of exogenous tPA
administered for thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke
damages brain tissue by activating NMDA receptor, disrupting the extracellular matrix, disturbing the NVU, and
causing direct neurotoxicity (Kaur et al., 2004; Zhang
et al., 2004; Mannaioni et al., 2008; Girouard et al., 2009;
Yamashita et al., 2009). This study suggests a new aspect
of the deleterious effect of tPA on pericytes by reducing
the proliferation of, and suppressing, PDGFRb protein
even after 4 days (Figs. 3, 4).
On the other hand, the administration of edaravone
restored both pericyte coverage and PDGFRb protein
expression at 4 days after tMCAO (Fig. 3). Yemisci et al.
(2009) demonstrated that pericyte contraction induced by
oxidative–nitrative stress impairs capillary reflow after
MCAO and that suppression of oxidative–nitrative stress
relieves pericyte contraction, reduces erythrocyte entrapment, and restores microvascular patency, hence improving

tissue survival. The administration of the free radical scavenger edaravone might prevent pericyte contraction,
induce the proliferation of pericytes, and reduce infarct
volume. We previously demonstrated that neurotoxic
effects of tPA were ameliorated by i.v. edavarone treatment
(Zhang et al., 2004) and that edaravone decreased MMP-9
activation and oxidative stress induced by tPA (LukicPanin et al., 2010). This study confirms that pericytes were
damaged and that proliferation of pericytes was prevented
by tPA and that edaravone ameliorated these damaging
effects, allowing pericytes to recover after tMCAO.
The present study shows a marked dissociation
between astrocyte foot processes and pericytes in the periischemic lesion with tPA, which was improved in the
edaravone-treated group (Fig. 5). Previous studies showed
that pericytes increased nerve growth factor (NGF) and
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) production after cerebral ischemia (Arimura et al., 2012; Ishitsuka et al., 2012). Pericytes
also secreted GDNF in the NVU (Shimizu et al., 2012).
In this study, the expression of GDNF decreased considerably in the tPA-treated group but was restored in the
edaravone-treated group (Fig. 6). The dissociation
between astrocyte foot processes and pericytes could
induce a dysfunctional NVU and decrease the secretion
of neuroprotective and angiogenesis-related proteins such
as GDNF, NGF, and NT-3.
We previously reported that edaravone maintains
the integrity of NVU and inhibits tPA-induced

hemorrhagic transformation (Lukic-Panin et al., 2010;
Yamashita et al., 2009). The present study re-emphasizes
that exogenous tPA damaged proliferating pericytes (Figs.
3, 4), the attachment to astrocytes (Fig. 5), and the secretion of neuroprotective factor (Fig. 6). However, edaravone not only greatly ameliorated this damage to
pericytes after tMCAO, it maintained the structure (Fig.
5) and function (Fig. 6) of the NVU. Additional studies
are required to reveal a more detailed interaction between
edaravone and pericytes in neuroprotection and angiogenesis after tMCAO.
