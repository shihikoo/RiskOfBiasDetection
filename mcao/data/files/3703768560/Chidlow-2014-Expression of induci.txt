Abstract
Inducible heat shock proteins (Hsps) are upregulated in the central nervous system
in response to a wide variety of injuries. Surprisingly, however, no coherent picture
has emerged regarding the magnitude, duration and cellular distribution of inducible
Hsps in the visual system following injury to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The
current study sought, therefore, to achieve the following two objectives. The first
aim of this study was to systematically characterise the patterns of Hsp27 and 270
expression in the retina and optic nerve in four discrete models of retinal ganglion
cell (RGC) degeneration: axonal injury (ON crush), somato-dendritic injury (NMDAinduced excitotoxicity), chronic hypoperfusion (bilateral occlusion of the carotid
arteris) and experimental glaucoma. The second aim was to document Hsp27 and
270 expression in the optic tract, the subcortical retinorecipient areas of the brain,
and the visual cortex during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons. Hsp27 was
robustly upregulated in the retina in each injury paradigm, with the chronic models,
2VO and experimental glaucoma, displaying a more persistent Hsp27
transcriptional response than the acute models. Hsp27 expression was always
associated with astrocytes and with a subset of RGCs in each of the models
excluding NMDA. Hsp27 was present within astrocytes of the optic nerve/optic tract
in control rats. During Wallerian degeneration, Hsp27 was upregulated in the optic
nerve/optic tract and expressed de novo by astrocytes in the lateral geniculate
nucleus and the stratum opticum of the superior colliculus. Conversely, the results
of our study indicate Hsp70 was minimally induced in any of the models of injury,
either in the retina, or in the optic nerve/optic tract, or in the subcortical,
retinorecipient areas of the brain. The findings of the present study augment our

understanding of the involvement of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the response of the visual
system to RGC degeneration.

Introduction
One mechanism by which mammalian cells respond to pathophysiological stress
is via the synthesis of highly conserved molecular chaperones termed heat shock
proteins (Hsps). These inducible proteins confer cellular protection against
ongoing and subsequent insults, as well as contributing to cellular repair
mechanisms [1]. Hsp27 and Hsp70 are among the most highly inducible members
of the Hsp family and, without doubt, the most studied, not least because of their
potent anti-apoptotic properties. In the brain, induction of both Hsp27 and 270
occurs within defined spatial and temporal parameters in response to various
pathological conditions, including, but by no means restricted, to ischemia,
excitotoxicity and axonal injury [2]. These Hsps are increasingly viewed as ideal
candidates to serve as biomarkers to identify near-lethal stress associated with
pathological conditions in the brain [3]. In terms of the cell types involved in each
response, Hsp27 is principally upregulated by astrocytes, while Hsp70 is classically
expressed by neurons [2].
Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and degeneration of their axons occurs in
a variety of conditions, most notably glaucomatous optic neuropathy, but also
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, arterial and venous vessel occlusions,
traumatic optic neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy. There is a strong likelihood
that Hsp27 and/or Hsp70 are upregulated as endogenous survival factors in
conditions involving RGC loss, as occurs in neurodegenerative paradigms in the
brain. It is surprising, therefore, to find that no coherent picture has emerged
regarding the magnitude, duration and cellular distribution of Hsp70 in models of
RGC degeneration. While some authors have documented an upregulation of
Hsp70 by RGCs in paradigms of ischemia [4, 5, 6], other studies have found no
evidence for increased expression [7, 8]. In an analagous way, studies utilising
induced rat models of experimental glaucoma, have produced opposing results
concerning whether or not Hsp70 is induced [9, 10]. Furthermore, an increase in
Hsp70 expression by RGCs has been noted after excitotoxic injury [11], but not in
a model of ischemic optic neuropathy [12]. The situation as regards Hsp27 is less
ambiguous. In contrast to the brain, Hsp27 appears to be upregulated both by
neurons and glial cells in models of RGC degeneration [7, 13, 14, 15, 16].
There is increasing recognition that optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma,
affect the visual target areas in the brain at early stages of the disease. While
transsynaptic degeneration of neurons within the LGN and SC following
Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons appears to be a protracted process, glial cell
activation [17, 18], axonal transport deficits [19, 20, 21] and dendritic changes
[22] have all been shown to be early events. One recent study found that positron

emission tomography imaging of an activated glial marker in the LGN of
glaucomatous monkeys was a sensitive and early tool for disease diagnosis [23].
An increased understanding of the pathology of the visual target areas during
RGC axonal inury will potentially aid disease diagnosis, provide tissue biomarkers
to more precisely assess injury status, and better inform as to suitable
neuroprotection strategies. In principal, inducible Hsps represent ideal candidates
for each of these goals; however, to date, little information has been available à
propos the expression patterns of inducible Hsps in the visual target areas of the
brain during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons.
The current study sought to achieve two objectives. The first aim was to
systematically characterise the patterns of Hsp27 and 270 expression in the retina
and ON in four distinct rat models of RGC degeneration: (1) Optic nerve (ON)
crush, which causes severe mechanical trauma to myelinated RGC axons and leads
to retrograde death of RGCs; (2) NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, which induces
somato-dendritic death of RGCs; (3) Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid
arteries (2VO), which results in chronic retinal and ON hypoperfusion; (4) Laserinduced experimental glaucoma. The second aim was to document Hsp27 and
270 expression in the optic tract (OT), the subcortical retinorecipient areas of the
brain, and the visual cortex during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons. To
achieve these goals, we used a combination of qPCR, immunohistochemistry and
Western blotting.

Materials and Methods
Animals and procedures
This study was approved by the South Australia Pathology/Central Health
Network Animal Ethics committee (permit numbers: 117/11, 97/08) and
conforms with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals
for Scientific Purposes, 2004. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia
(100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine), and all efforts were made to
minimize suffering. All experiments also conformed to the ARVO Statement for
the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Adult Sprague-Dawley
rats (220–300 g) were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
environment with a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle and were provided with
food and water ad libitum.
Experimental glaucoma

Ocular hypertension was induced in the right eye of each animal by laser
photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork using a slightly modified protocol
[24] of the method described by Levkovitch-Verbin et al. [25]. For the two week
time point, a second laser treatment was given on day 7 if the difference in
intraocular pressure (IOP) between the two eyes was less than 8 mmHg. IOPs
were measured in both eyes at baseline, day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 14 using a
rebound tonometer, factory calibrated for use in rats. All animals demonstrated an

adequate IOP elevation (minimum increase in IOP of 10 mmHg). Two animals
were excluded as a result of death under anaesthesia and 2 due to hyphema. The
number of rats analysed at each time point for RT-PCR was as follows: 1d (n57),
3d (n58), 7d (n58), 14d (n57). The retinas and ONs from the 7d cohort were
also used for Western blotting. In addition, a further 3 animals were taken at each
time point for immunohistochemistry.
NMDA-induced excitotoxicity

For NMDA experiments, an intravitreal injection of 40 nmol of NMDA (5 ml in
sterile saline) was performed in one eye, while the contralateral eye received 5 ml
of sterile saline. The number of rats analysed at each time point for RT-PCR was
as follows: 1d (n56), 3d (n57), 7d (n57). The retinas and ONs from the 7d
cohort were also used for Western blotting. In addition, a further 3 animals were
taken at each time point for immunohistochemistry.
ON crush

ON crush was performed as previously described [26]. In brief, the superior
muscle complex was divided and the ON exposed by blunt dissection. The ON
was then crushed 3 mm posterior to the globe under direct visualisation using
number 5 forceps for 20s. To avoid confusing retinal ischemic changes with the
effects of crush, the fundus was observed ophthalmoscopically immediately after
nerve crush, in order to discard any animals with pale (ischemic) retina as a result
of surgery. The number of rats analysed at each time point for RT-PCR was as
follows: 1d (n54), 3d (n54), 7d (n54). The retinas and ONs from the 7d cohort
were also used for Western blotting. In addition, a further 3 animals were taken at
each time point for immunohistochemistry.
2VO

Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries was performed as previously
described [27]. In brief, rats were anaesthetised and a ventral incision was made.
The common carotid arteries were then bilaterally separated from the carotid
sheath and vagus nerve. The arteries were ligated with silk sutures. Sham animals
received the same operation without occlusion of the vessels. The number of rats
analysed at each time point for RT-PCR was as follows: sham (n58), 2d (n58),
7d (n58). The retinas and ONs from the 7d cohort were also used for Western
blotting. In addition, a further 3 animals were taken at each time point for
immunohistochemistry.

Tissue Processing and Immunohistochemistry
All rats were killed by transcardial perfusion with physiological saline under deep
anaesthesia and, in those rats where tissue was not taken for RT-PCR/Western
blotting, subsequently with 10% buffered formalin. The brain, both eyes, both
ONs and the optic chiasm were carefully dissected. For rats taken for
immunohistochemsitry, all tissues were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at
least 24 h. Following fixation, the brain was positioned in the Kopf Rat brain

blocker (Kopf Instruments PA001) and 2 mm coronal slices were taken starting
from the dorsal and proceeding to the caudal portion of the brain. Brain slices,
along with the globe and optic pathway, were then processed for routine paraffinembedded sections [28]. Globes were embedded sagitally, while ONs and
chiasmata were embedded longitudinally. In all cases, 4 mm serial sections were
cut using a rotary microtome.
Colourimetric immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described
[26, 28]. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinised and endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with H2O2. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving
sections in 10 mM citrate (pH 6.0) and non-specific labelling blocked with PBS
containing 3% normal horse serum (PBS-NHS). Sections were incubated
overnight at room temperature in primary antibody (in PBS-NHS, see Table 1),
followed by consecutive incubations with biotinylated secondary antibody
(Vector, Burlingame, CA) and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Color development was achieved using either NovaRed substrate
kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 3 min or 39-,39-diaminobenzidine for 5 min.
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared in histolene
and mounted. Confirmation of the specificity of antibody labelling was judged by
the morphology and distribution of the labelled cells, by the absence of signal
when the primary antibody was replaced by isotype/serum controls, by
comparison with the expected staining pattern based on our own, and other,
previously published results, and, by the detection within retinal samples of a
protein at the expected molecular weight by Western blotting.
For double labelling fluorescent immunohistochemistry, visualisation of one
antigen was achieved using a 3-step procedure (primary antibody, biotinylated
secondary antibody, streptavidin-conjugated AlexaFluor 488 or 594), while the
second antigen was labelled by a 2-step procedure (primary antibody, secondary
antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or 594). Sections were prepared as above,
then incubated overnight at room temperature in the appropriate combination of
primary antibodies. On the following day, sections were incubated with the
appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for the 3-step procedure plus the
correct secondary antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or 594 for the 2-step
procedure, followed by streptavidin-conjugated AlexaFluor 488 or 594. Sections
were then mounted using anti-fade mounting medium and examined under a
confocal fluorescence microscope.

Evaluation of immunohistochemistry in the LGN and SC
Quantitative evaluation of Hsp27 and Hsp70 expression in the LGN and SC was
conducted in animals previously subjected to ON crush and in control rats.
LGN

Initially, coronal sections were stained for H&E and immunolabelled for
parvalbumin in order to verify that the correct anatomical position had been
identified. Parvalbumin facilitates easy identification of the dorsal LGN (dLGN),

ventral LGN (vLGN) and intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). The brain area of interest
was set at approximately bregma 24.5 mm, the midpoint of the LGN [29].
Subsequently, sections were labelled for Hsp27 and Hsp70. Next, the number of
Hsp27- and Hsp70-positive cells were counted manually by a single observer in
photomicrographs taken in the dLGN and vLGN regions of both the ipsilateral
and contralateral sides. Selection criteria excluded small cell fragments or cells
without a visible nucleus. The area photographed and used for quantification
(350 mm6260 mm) represents 0.091 mm2 and was set around the central portion
of the dLGN and the lateral division of the vLGN. Three stained sections were
quantified from each animal.
SC

Initially, coronal sections were stained for H&E and immunolabelled for calbindin
and parvalbumin in order to verify that the correct anatomical position had been
identified. The brain area of interest was set at approximately bregma 26.0 mm
[29]. Sections were then labelled for Hsp27 and Hsp70 and the number of positive
cells were counted in photomicrographs taken in the stratum opticum/stratum
griseum superficiale of the ipsilateral and contralateral SC. From each
immunolabelled section, 3 fields were selected, representing the medial through to
lateral SC. As for the LGN, 3 stained sections were typically quantified from each

animal. The area photographed and used for quantification (350 mm6260 mm)
in each case equates to 0.091 mm2.
For both the LGN and SC, all measurements from one animal were averaged
and treated as an independent data point. All data are presented as mean ¡ SEM
and statistical comparisons were made between the control, 3d and 7d groups by
ANOVA, followed by post-hoc Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test.

Western Immunoblotting
Electrophoresis/Western blotting was performed as previously described [27]. In
brief, tissue extracts were sonicated in homogenisation buffer, diluted with an
equal volume of sample buffer, and boiled for 3 minutes. Electrophoresis was
performed using non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. After separation,
proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes for immunoprobing. Blocking of membranes was carried out in a solution of tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat dried
skimmed milk (TBS-TM). Membranes were then incubated consecutively with the
appropriate primary antibody (Table 1), biotinylated secondary antibody and
streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. Colour development was achieved using 3amino-9-ethylcarbazole. The images were captured and analysed for densitometry
using the program, Adobe PhotoShop CS2. Densitometry values were normalised
for actin. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student’s unpaired t-test (control
group vs 7d injured group). The null hypothesis tested was that densitometry
measurements for target proteins (normalised for actin) would be the same in
control and experimental retinas.

Real-time RT-PCR
Real time PCR studies were carried out essentially as described previously [30]. In
brief, tissues were dissected, total RNA was isolated and first strand cDNA was
synthesised from DNase-treated RNA samples. Real-time PCR reactions were
carried out in 96-well optical reaction plates using the cDNA equivalent of 20 ng
total RNA for each sample in a total volume of 20 ml containing 16 SYBR Green
PCR master mix (BioRad), forward and reverse primers. Thermal cycling
conditions were 95 ˚C for 3 min and 40 cycles of amplification comprising 95 ˚C
for 12 s, appropriate annealing temperature for 30 s and 72 ˚C for 30 s. Primer sets
used were as follows (sense primer, antisense primer, annealing temperature,
product size, accession number): GAPDH (59-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-39,
59-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-39, 63 ˚c, 87 bp, GenBank ID: NM_017008),
NF-L (59-ATGGCATTGGACATTGAGATT-39, 59CTGAGAGTAGCCGCTGGTTAT-39, 63 ˚c, 105 bp, AF031880), Hsp27 (59CACTGGCAAGCACGAAGAAA-39, 59-CAGGGGACAGGGAAGAGGA-39, 62 ˚c,
119 bp, GenBank ID: NM_031970), Hsp70 (59-ACGAGGGTCTCAAGGGCAAG39, 59-CTCTTTCTCAGCCAGCGTGTTAG-39, 63 ˚c, 107 bp, GenBank ID:
NM_031971). PCR assays were performed using the IQ5 icycler (Bio-Rad) and all

samples were run in duplicate. GAPDH, NF-L, Hsp27 and Hsp70 mRNAs
amplified with high efficiency and linearity during real-time PCR. Mean
amplification efficiencies, as determined by plotting cycle threshold as a function
of initial cDNA quantity, were approximately 2.00 for GAPDH, NF-L, Hsp27 and
Hsp70. Results obtained from the real-time PCR experiments were, therefore,
quantified using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method (DDCT) for relative
quantitation of gene expression [31]. All values were normalised using the
endogenous housekeeping gene GAPDH and expressed relative to controls.
Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc
Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test (NMDA, ON crush, 2VO) or by Student’s
unpaired t-test followed by modified Bonferroni correction (experimental
glaucoma). The null hypothesis tested was that CT differences between target and
housekeeping genes would be the same in control and experimental retinas.

Results
Expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in brain after transient MCAO
Tissue sections from rats subjected to focal ischemia were employed in this study
for two reasons: Firstly, transient MCAO is well-known to cause a pronounced
induction of both Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the affected hemisphere [32, 33]. As such,
the model serves as an excellent positive control for the specificity of the Hsp27
and 270 antibodies. Secondly, the results provide a useful tool by which to
compare the cell types responsible for expression of Hsp27 and 270 in the brain
and retina after neuronal injury.
In sham brains, Hsp27 immunolabelling was restricted to some blood vessels
and to very occasional astrocytes in white matter tracts, while there was minimal
constitutive expression of Hsp70 in either grey or white matter (Fig. 1). Transient
MCAO, which causes an ischemic infarct centred within the striatum, resulted in a
dramatic induction of both Hsp27 and Hsp70 at 1d in the affected hemisphere.
Expression of Hsp27 encompassed both grey and white matter and was
overwhelmingly associated with cells with the morphology of astrocytes (Fig. 1).
In contrast, Hsp70 was expressed by cells with the morphology of neurons, but
was ostensibly absent from white matter tracts. Double labelling immunofluorescence confirmed that Hsp27 expression colocalised with GFAP-labelled
astrocytes, while Hsp70 colocalised to NeuN-labelled neurons (data not shown).

Expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70 mRNAs in the retina during RGC
degeneration
We performed a temporal characterization of Hsp27 and Hsp70 gene expression
in the retina in four models of RGC degeneration. To impart perspective on the
results, we also determined the levels of neurofilament light (NF-L) mRNA, which
is a sensitive early gauge of RGC viability [34, 35]. After NMDA-induced
excitotoxicity (Fig. 2A), NF-L mRNA was maximally down-regulated by 1d,

immunolabelling is restricted to blood vessels in sham brains (A, B), but is widely expressed by reactive
astrocytes in ipsilateral grey and white matter regions at 1d following MCAO (C, D). Hsp70 immunolabelling is
minimal in sham brains (E, F), but is exclusively associated with neurons in ipsilateral grey matter regions at
1d following MCAO (G). No unambiguous Hsp70 labelling is evident in white matter tracts (H). Note: grey

indicating that all affected RGC somas were no longer transcriptionally viable.
Hsp27 mRNA was upregulated 3.1-fold at this time point, then slowly declined
towards the control level at the 3d and 7d time points. Hsp70 mRNA was not
statistically different from controls at any time point. Following ON crush
(Fig. 2B), NF-L mRNA was statistically unaffected at 1d, but was reduced to 34%
and 23% of the control level at 3d and 7d, respectively. Hsp27 mRNA was not
changed at the earliest time point, but was 5.2-fold higher than controls at 3d and
2.6 fold higher at 7d. Hsp70 mRNA was not statistically different from controls at
any time point after ON crush. During 2VO (Fig. 2C), the NFL mRNA level in
treated retinas was 53% of the level in shams at 2d, and 15% by 7d. Hsp27 mRNA
was 2.9-fold higher than shams at 2d, and 4.3 fold higher at 7d. In contrast to the
other models of injury, there was a small (1.5-fold at both 2d and 7d), but
statistically significant (P,0.01 for both time points), upregulation of Hsp70
mRNA during 2VO. After induction of experimental glaucoma (Fig. 2D), the NFL
mRNA level in treated retinas was 89% of controls at 1d, 73% at 3d, 45% at 7d,
and 43% by 14d. As regards Hsp27, there was a striking and sustained increase in
transcription, such that the Hsp27 mRNA level was 3.5-fold higher than controls
at 1d, 5.5-fold at 3d, 6.7-fold at 7d, and 6.3-fold at 14d. Again, Hsp70 mRNA was
unaffected at any time point during experimental glaucoma.

(27 kD and 70 kD, respectively) by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Inspection of the
blots indicated that the level of Hsp70 protein in healthy retinas is, in all
probability, higher than the level of Hsp27 protein, as the former band was always
more intense than the latter in any given sample. Quantification of the levels of
Hsp27 and Hsp70 proteins at the 7d time point in the various models of RGC
injury revealed that Hsp27 was significantly (P,0.01 for 2VO; P,0.05 for other
models) upregulated in the retinas from all four treated groups compared to the
relevant controls (Fig. 3C–F). The extent of Hsp27 upregulation in each model
was broadly similar, with NMDA, as was the case for the mRNA study, proving
slightly less efficacious than the other injury models. As regards Hsp70 protein, no
significant upregulation was found in any RGC injury model, although treated
retinas in the 2VO model showed a tendency (21% higher than controls; P50.18)
to higher expression.
Immunolabelling of tissue sections from control retinas showed that Hsp27 is
expressed in blood vessels and to some extent by astrocytes (Fig. 4A, B), while
Hsp70 expression is localised exclusively to photoreceptor cell bodies and inner
segments (Fig. 4C, D). NMDA caused a sustained increase in Hsp27 expression by
astrocytes when compared with control eyes, which was detectable within 24 h
(data not shown) and persisted for at least 7d (Fig. 4E). Hsp27 immunoreactivity
was, however, not associated with surviving RGCs after NMDA. ON crush, 2VO
and experimental glaucoma also induced persistent upregulation of Hsp27 by
astrocytes (Fig. 4F–H). In addition, Hsp27-positive cells were evident in the GCL,
but not the INL, from 3d onwards in each injury model (see Fig. 4F-H for
representative images from 7d retinas). Double labelling immunofluorescence
showed that, in each injury model, Hsp27 colocalised with x-synuclein, indicating
its presence within RGCs (See Fig. 5A–C for representative images from a rat
subjected to ON crush). No discernible upregulation of Hsp70 protein was
detected in RGCs, in other retinal neurons, or in retinal glial cells either at 1d
(data not shown), 3d (data not shown), or 7d (Fig. 4I–L) following NMDA, ON
crush, 2VO or experimental glaucoma, or at 14d after experimental glaucoma
(data not shown). Constitutive expression of Hsp70 by photoreceptors appeared
unaffected in all four models of injury (Fig. 4I–L).

Expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the ON and OT during RGC

When incubated with ON samples from control or treated rats, the Hsp27
antibody detected a single band at approximately 27 kD by Western blotting

expected molecular weight when used with the same samples (Fig. 3B).
Quantification of the levels of Hsp27 and Hsp70 proteins in the ON at the 7d time
point in the various models of RGC injury revealed highly similar results to the
retina, namely that Hsp27 was significantly (P,0.05 for experimental glaucoma;
P,0.01 for other models) upregulated in all four treated groups compared to the
relevant controls (Fig. 3G–J). The extent of Hsp27 upregulation in each model
was comparable (2–2.5-fold). As regards Hsp70 protein, no significant
upregulation was found in any RGC injury model (Fig. 3G–J); Hsp70 bands were
faint or not detectable in all samples.
Immunolabelling of tissue sections from control ONs and OTs (approximately
bregma 23.3 mm) showed that Hsp27 is expressed by cells with the
morphological appearance and distribution of astrocytes (Fig. 6E, G), while
Hsp70 expression was not detectable (Fig. 6I, K). Analysis of ONs and OTs from
rats subjected to the four models of injury showed essentially identical patterns of
immunolabelling. In each case, the injury model caused Wallerian degeneration of
RGC axons throughout the length of the ON and OT, which can be easily
visualized at the 7d time point by labelling with an antibody that recognises non-

appearance (Fig. 6A–D). In ONs and OTs from the treated groups with
degenerating axons, substantially more Hsp27 immunolabelling was apparent
(Fig. 6F, H). This was the case for the entire length of the white matter tract from
the optic nerve head via the optic chiasm to the brachium of the superior

any injured ONs or OTs (Fig. 6J, L). Double labelling immunofluorescence

colocalised with astrocytic markers (See Fig. 5D–F for representative images from
the optic chiasm of a rat subjected to ON crush and double labelled for Hsp27 and

Expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the LGN and SC during RGC
degeneration
Detailed analysis of the expression of Hsp27 and 270 in the subcortical,
retinorecipient areas of the brain during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons
was conducted using animals from the ON crush model of RGC injury. It should
be noted, however, that a single, representative brain from each of the three other
RGC injury models (NMDA, 7d; 2VO, 7d; experimental glaucoma, 14d) was
analysed qualitatively and all displayed similar Hsp27 and 270 responses to those
subjected to ON crush.
LGN

Immunolabelling of control animals, and animals subjected to ON crush 1d
previously, showed Hsp27 expression to be restricted to blood vessels (data not
shown). In 3d and 7d ON crush rats, however, the contralateral LGN additionally
featured numerous Hsp27-positive cells with the apparent morphology of
astrocytes distributed throughout the dLGN, IGL and vLGN (Fig. 7D, E). The
ipsilateral LGN was essentially devoid of Hsp27-immunopositive cells (Fig. 7F,
G). This is unsurprising as 90–95% of ON axons in the rat cross the midline and
project to the contralateral OT. Quantification of the Hsp27 response in the

degeneration (B, D). In the uninjured ON and OT, Hsp27 is associated with a population of glial cells. One

dLGN and lateral division of the vLGN (Table 2) showed that both areas featured
a similar number of labelled cells at each of the time points. Pooled (vLGN and
dLGN combined) analysis of the 3d versus 7d time points did, however, show a
slight increase in the number of Hsp27-positive cells at the later time (P,0.01 by
Student’s unpaired t-test). In contrast to Hsp27, no immunolabelling for Hsp70
was detectable in the dLGN, vLGN or IGL of control rats (data not shown) or ON
crush rats (Fig. 7H–K). Double labelling immunofluorescence showed that Hsp27
colocalised with GFAP in the LGN (S2A–C Fig.), confirming its presence within
astrocytes. No colocalisation was observed with iba1, which is specific to microglia
(S2D–F Fig.).
SC

As expected, immunolabelling of control rats, or rats subjected to ON crush 1d
previously, showed Hsp27 expression to be limited to blood vessels (data not
shown). In 3d and 7d ON crush rats, however, numerous Hsp27-positive cells
with the morphological apperance of astrocytes were observed in a tight band
localised within the superficial layers of the contralateral SC. These cells spanned
the medial through to the lateral SC (Fig. 8E, F) and were evident throughout the
rostral-caudal axis. As expected, very few Hsp27-labelled cells were evident in the

nor with the neuronal marker NeuN, nor with the proliferative marker PCNA
(Fig. 9I–K). PCNA-positive cells were present within the superficial layers of the
SC, but these cells were microglia not astrocytes (see S3 Fig.).

Expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the visual cortex during RGC
degeneration
In the visual cortex of control brains, Hsp27 immunolabelling was limited to
some blood vessels, while Hsp70 immunoreactivity was not observed (data not

shown) or 7d previously (Fig. 10) revealed no upregulation of either Hsp in the
injured (contralateral) or uninjured (ipsilateral) side.

Discussion
The current study sought to achieve two objectives. The first aim was to describe
the patterns of Hsp27 and 270 expression in the retina in four discrete models of
RGC degeneration: axonal injury (ON crush), somato-dendritic injury (NMDA-

induced excitotoxicity), chronic hypoperfusion (2VO) and experimental glaucoma. The second aim was to document Hsp27 and 270 expression in the ON/
OT and subcortical, retinorecipient areas of the brain during Wallerian
degeneration of RGC axons. The results showed that Hsp27 was robustly
upregulated in the retina in each injury paradigm, with the chronic models, 2VO
and experimental glaucoma, displaying a more persistent Hsp27 transcriptional
response than the acute models. Hsp27 expression was always associated with
astrocytes and with a subset of RGCs in each of the models excluding NMDA.
Hsp27 was present within astrocytes of the ON/OT in control rats. During
Wallerian degeneration, Hsp27 was upregulated in the ON/OT and expressed de
novo by astrocytes in the LGN and the stratum opticum of the SC. Conversely, the
results of our study indicate Hsp70 was not induced in any of the models of
injury, either in the retina, or in the ON/OT, or in the subcortical, retinorecipient
areas of the brain.
As stated above, we found minimal evidence for induction of Hsp70 by RGCs,
or indeed by any other neuronal or glial cell types in the retina, in any of the
models of injury. In order to reach this conclusion, we followed a systematic
approach involving qPCR, immunohistochemical and Western blotting analyses
throughout the time period both prior to, and encompassing, RGC degeneration.
The qPCR technique ensured sensitivity to any transcriptional changes, the
specificity and effectiveness of the immunohistochemistry methodology was
verified by concurrent immunolabelling of brain sections from MCAO rats, and
the Western blotting procedure on each retinal sample with Hsp70 yielded a single
band of the expected molecular weight and overall densitometry data that
corresponded with the qPCR and immunohistochemistry findings. As such, there
appears little doubt that Hsp70 is neither acutely, nor persistently, upregulated in
situations of RGC injury. One caveat to this conclusion is that we did measure a
statistically significant upregulation of Hsp70 mRNA in the 2VO model of injury.
The high sensitivity of qPCR likely accounts for the fact that this upregulation was
not mirrored by an upregulation in the Hsp70 protein level. We hypothesise that
since the 2VO model affects the outer as well as the inner retina, unlike the other
three models, that the subtle upregulation of Hsp70 mRNA during 2VO resulted

from enhanced constitutive expression by photoreceptors rather than from de
novo expression by other retinal cell types.
Our overall finding of minimal upregulation of Hsp70 following RGC injury is
in agreement with the results of various studies that assessed Hsp70 expression in
paradigms of ischemia [7], 2VO [8] or experimental glaucoma [9], but
contradicts the published data of other studies in the retina that positively
identified Hsp70 upregulation. How can these disparate results be reconciled?
Firstly, the upregulations in retinal Hsp70 expression observed following sublethal
hypoxia in cultured RGCs [4], and after ischemia-reperfusion [5] were rapid and
transient in nature, occurring up to two hours after the insult. It is quite feasible
that similar phenomena were apparent in the current study, but were not detected
as the earliest time point analysed was 1d. It can be argued that transient changes
are of relatively little relevance in the context of ongoing survival or death of
RGCs. Secondly, the upregulations in Hsp70 expression noted in models of
NMDA-induced excitotoxicity [11] and experimental glaucoma [10] were also of
short durations and characterised by only subtle immunohistochemical changes
not verified by Western blotting or other techniques. Taking into account our
results and all of the previous body of published data, it can be deduced that the
retina does not instigate a robust endogenous Hsp70 response to aid RGC
survival.
The situation in the retina contrasts markedly with the brain, where, for
example, models of transient and permanent, focal as well as global, ischemia (see
[2] for review), excitotoxicity [36, 37], and axonal injury [38] all result in
sustained Hsp70 upregulation within neuronal populations. Why does the retina,
despite being a part of the central nervous system (CNS), differ so markedly from
the brain with respect to its Hsp70 injury profile? The issue is not easily resolved,
but two relevant points can be made. Firstly, the retina and brain differ in their
expression profile of Hsp70 when healthy, not just as a consequence to injury.
Specifically, there is negligible constitutive expression of Hsp70 in the brain. Yet,
in the retina, Hsp70 is present within normal photoreceptor cell bodies and inner
segments [39]. Photoreceptors are one of the most specialised neurons within the
CNS and have extremely high energy demands owing to the continuous synthesis
and shedding of disc segments. It has been hypothesised that Hsp70 is persistently
induced in photoreceptors to chaperone native proteins against the damaging
effects of free radicals produced by light and mitochondrial respiration [2].
Obviously, this does not explain why RGCs themselves do not upregulate Hsp70
after injury, but it does illustrate that the specialised nature of the retina has
resulted in the evolution of a differing tissue Hsp profile to the brain. Secondly,
the response, or lack thereof, in RGCs can be putatively explained by the fact that
these neurons express Hsp27 instead of Hsp70 following induction of damaging
stimuli. While Hsp27 upregulation in the brain has been noted in neuronal
populations following ischemia [32], this small Hsp is primarily associated with
astrocytes rather than neurons. Yet, in the retina, a number of studies
[7, 13, 14, 15, 40] have documented robust, persistent expression of Hsp27 by
injured RGCs, findings corroborated herein. In this respect, RGCs reflect the

functioning of peripheral nerves, where axonal injury leads to induction and
prolonged expression of Hsp27, but not of Hsp70 [41, 42]. A similar response is
not seemingly intrinsic to central neurons. There is a certain irony here in that the
ON is considered a quintessential CNS white matter tract.
Interest in the expression profiles and activities of inducible Hsps is motivated,
to a considerable extent, by the ongoing search for factors that prolong RGC
survival. Hsp27 [43, 44, 45] and 270 [4, 46, 47, 48] are both firmly implicated as
anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective effectors in retinal preconditioning modalities. It
is somewhat surprising, therefore, that the effectiveness of neither protein has
been investigated using overexpression, transfection or prolonged delivery
approaches, as has occurred for neurotrophins, since they represent an appealing
strategy for prolonging RGC survival in glaucoma. Our present results show that
Hsp27, but not 270, is involved in the endogenous survival response of the retina
to RGC injury. It might be argued, therefore, that delivery of Hsp27 would be
ineffective in diseases featuring RGC loss, as these neurons already express the
molecular chaperone when injured. In fact, only a small proportion of RGCs
express Hsp27 during experimental glaucoma and even after ON transectioninduced injury, which affects the entire population of RGCs [13]; thus boosting
Hsp27 expression may prove an effective tactic.
As highlighted in the introduction, an increased understanding of the pathology
of the visual target areas during RGC axonal injury will potentially aid disease
diagnosis, provide tissue biomarkers to more precisely assess injury status, and
better inform as to suitable neuroprotection strategies. In principal, inducible
Hsps represent ideal candidates for each of these goals; however, to date, little
concerted information has been available à propos the expression patterns of
inducible Hsps in the OT, LGN, SC and visual cortex as Wallerian degeneration of
RGC axons progresses: Krueger-Naug and colleagues [13] revealed that Hsp27 is
expressed in the OT and SC following transection of the ON, while Zhao et al
[49], in a short communication, noted that Hsp70 was associated with cells in the
IGL of the LGN. Our results confirm and extend the former data. We have shown
that in each of the models of RGC injury, Hsp27 is strongly upregulated in
astrocytes within the OT (as well as ON) concurrent with axonal cytoskeleton
breakdown. Moreover, Hsp27 was also induced in astrocytes present within the
dLGN, IGL, vLGN, and SC. It appears likely that astrocytes in close proximity to
degenerating RGC axons and their terminals synthesize Hsp27. We were
interested in whether astrocytes within the injured LGN and within the different
layers of the SC were quiescent or dividing and how such a response might relate
to expression of Hsp27. The results showed that PCNA-positive, proliferative cells
were present within both target areas; however, these cells were microglia rather
than astrocytes, indicating that astrocytes, while reactive and expressing molecular
chaperones such as Hsp27, were not undergoing de-differentiation.
Of particular interest, HSP27-positive astrocytes in the SC were restricted to a
narrow band predominantly localised to the stratum opticum. This is an
intriguing result as all of the superficial layers of the SC (stratum zonale, stratum
griseum superficiale and stratum opticum) receive input from RGC axons, and all

Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the Injured Visual Pathway

three layers display increased astrocytic (GFAP) and microglial (iba1) activity
during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons, as identified herein and by others
[17, 50]. Nevertheless, the stratum opticum is the layer most densely innervated by
the retina; thus, it is logical that endogenous responses to injury would be more
efficacious. Krueger-Naug et al [13] suggested that Hsp27 may be a more precise
marker for areas of more severe injury. We would further hypothesize that Hsp27
may represent a useful surrogate marker for assessing the status of LGN and SC
injury in short-term RGC neuroprotection studies. To date, the extent of injury
and protection in the LGN and SC is dependent upon quantification of neuronal
survival, which necessitates experiments of many months [51, 52].
Our study indicates that neither Hsp27 nor Hsp70 are upregulated by neurons
in the LGN or SC during RGC axonal degeneration. We paid particular attention
to the IGL, which is simple to identify using a combination of parvalbumin and
Substance P immunolabelling [53], but we were unable to corroborate the
preliminary findings of Zhao et al. [49]. The lack of inducible Hsp27 or 270
expression by target neurons is not unexpected, as transsynaptic neuronal
degeneration lags RGC axonal degeneration by a considerable time [51, 52, 54]. A
similar comment can be applied to the lack of Hsp27 or 270 expression in the
visual cortex. It might be expected that astrocytes in the visual cortex would
express Hsp27 following loss of input consequent to RGC degeneration; however,
upregulation of Hsp27 presumably only occurs in conjunction with degeneration
of the optic radiation, which will arise as transsynaptic neuronal degeneration
proceeds in the LGN.
In conclusion, the findings of the present study augment our understanding of
the involvement of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the response of the visual system to RGC
degeneration.
