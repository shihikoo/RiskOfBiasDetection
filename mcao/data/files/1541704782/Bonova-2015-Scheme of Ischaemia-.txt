Abstract The impact of therapeutic intervention in stroke
depends on its appropriate timing during infarct evolution.
We have studied markers of brain tissue damage initiated by
permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) at
three time points during which the infarct spread (1, 3 and
6 h). Based on Evans Blue extravasation and immunohistochemical detection of neurons, we confirmed continuous disruption of blood-brain barrier and loss of neurons in the ischaemic hemisphere that peaked at the sixth hour, especially in
the core. Glutamate content started to rise dramatically in the
entire hemisphere during the first 3 h; the highest level was
determined in the core 6 h after MCAO (141 % increase).
Moreover, the enzyme antioxidant defence grew by about
42 % since the first hour in the ipsilateral penumbra. Enzymes
of the apoptotic pathway as well as mitochondrial enzyme
release were detected since the third hour of MCAO in the
ischaemic hemisphere; all achieved their maxima in the penumbra during both time periods (except cytochrome C). In
conclusion, the preserved integrity of mitochondrial membrane and incompletely developed process of apoptosis may
contribute to the better therapeutic outcome after ischaemic
attack; however, a whole brain response should not be
omitted.

Introduction
The final extent of brain damage after ischaemic insult results
from a combination of processes that are initiated by the ischaemia itself and by a series of subsequent reactions to it in
the case of circulation renewal. Because very early blood supply restoration is a crucial step for minimizing ischaemia impact, prolonged or permanent blockade of blood circulation in
brain tissue represents a serious problem in clinical practice.
At present, the phenomenon of ischaemic tolerance has become an attractive strategy for improving ischaemia outcome.
There are several possibilities for how to boost post-ischaemic
neuronal survival (especially post-conditioning), such as repeated short ischaemia, pharmacological treatment and remote
limb tourniquet (Zhao et al. 2012). Based on experimental
practice (and as noted below), the right timing of an intervention is essential for a good outcome (Durukan and Tatlisumak
2010).
In general, the affected brain tissue can be divided into two
parts, the core and penumbra. The core represents the central
part of the ischaemic region that is characterized by membrane
depolarization and, in connection with this, a breakdown in
energy metabolism. The energy metabolism in the surrounding tissue, the penumbra, is preserved; however, some metabolic, electrical and functional parameters of the tissue may be
influenced (Astrup et al. 1981). Spread of the membrane depolarization to penumbra tissue during ongoing ischaemia results in expansion of the ischaemic core and therefore in expansion of the brain damage (Hartings et al. 2003; Ayata
2013). This process is not uniform in transient focal ischaemia
models and depends strictly on secondary injury due to circulation renewal. On the other hand, in permanent models of
brain ischaemia, this expansion is non-linear, spreading rapidly during the first 3 h but essentially terminated between the
third and sixth hour of ischaemia (Hossmann 2008).

74

In ischaemia produced by MCAO, core neurons demonstrate the morphological and biochemical changes of necrotic
cell death (Yao et al. 2001). In contrast to this, in the penumbra, ischaemia-induced events more often lead to programmed
cell death (Lipton 1999) that seems similar to delayed neuronal death in ischaemia-sensitive neurons (selective vulnerable
neurons) (Du et al. 1996; Endres et al. 1998). Post-ischaemic
upstream death signals generated by cell membrane death receptors or by the release of death-inducing mitochondrial proteins activate downstream events that ultimately lead to DNA
fragmentation and cell death. Released cytochrome C leads to
procaspase-9 activation, which, in turn, cleaves and activates
procaspase-3. Both caspase-9 and -3 activation has been implicated as a mechanism of neuronal cell death after ischaemia
(reviewed in Plesnila et al. 2004). Moreover, the role of
other factors, such as glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity,
changes in the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase isoforms, and protein synthesis in ischaemiaaffected tissue could be suitable markers of core spreading as well as for distinguishing the actual extent of the
core/penumbra (Bonova et al. 2013).
As indicated above, the positive effect of therapeutic intervention in stroke models is primarily connected to the right
timing of the intervention. In permanent ischaemia, the time
window is limited by core spreading; thus, it is limited by the
irreversible cellular breakdown of energy metabolism. The
greatest potential should be expected while the penumbra
has a maximum volume, i.e., within the first Bgolden^ hour
of blood restriction. During this time, the penumbra accounts
for up to 50 % of the infarct volume (Saver et al. 2010). With
ongoing ischaemia, the extent of the penumbra rapidly declines and after the third hour disappears almost completely
(Hossmann 2012). From this point of view, it becomes very
interesting to clarify the process of ischaemic damage spread
from a reversible to an irreversible state. In the present paper,
we monitored the clearest representatives of ischaemiainduced tissue damage and their evolution during the process
of core expansion to its final state at three time points: (a) the
first Bgolden^ hour of ischaemia, (b) 3 hours and (c) the sixth
hour of ischaemia when the process of core expansion has
terminated.

Material and Methods
The experiments were carried out in accordance with the protocol for animal care approved by European Communities
Council Directive (2010/63/EU). Every effort was made to
minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals
used. Adult male albino Wistar rats weighing 270–320 g were
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and given food and
water ad libitum. Food was withdrawn 1 day before surgery.

Design of Experiment
Four groups containing five animals each were designed: the
control group comprising sham control animals (also
referred to as ischaemia 0 h) and three ischaemic groups
with a different duration of ischaemia (1 h of ischaemia
and 3 and 6 h of ischaemia). All animals were deeply
anaesthetized with chloralhydrate at the appropriate experimental time and decapitated. The brain was removed
and cut into 2-mm-thick slices by a rodent brain matrix
RBM 4000C (ASI Instruments, USA) and processed for
biochemical analysis with the exception of the third
slice of brain tissue, which was designated for Evans
Blue extravasation assay and immunohistochemical evaluation of NeuN positivity.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Focal cerebral ischaemia was produced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously (Longa
et al. 1989). The rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (4 %
initially, 1 to 1.5 % maintenance). Under an operating microscope, the right common carotid artery (CCA), the right external carotid artery (ECA) and the right internal carotid artery
(ICA) were isolated, and a 6-0 silk suture was tied at the origin
of the ECA and at the distal end of the ECA. A 4/0 nylon
monofilament was introduced into the ECA and pushed up the
ICA until light resistance was felt. The filament was inserted
approximately 19 to 20 mm from the carotid bifurcation to
effectively block the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The diameter of the tip of the suture was considered acceptable at
around 300 μm. The suture remained inserted for 1, 3 or 6 h,
after which the animals were decapitated. Control animals
were subjected to the same surgical procedure without subsequent monofilament insertion (sham control=ischaemia 0 h).
Local cerebral blood flow was measured to confirm the severity of MCA occlusion using a laser–Doppler flow meter
(PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed AB, Sweden). A 407 probe
with an adequate holder was situated on the skull over the
MCA location (5 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to the bregma). Only rats with blood flow reduced by more than 80 %
were used for the experiments.
Neurological deficits were assessed in each animal on a
numerical scale of 0–4 at 60 min of MCAO. The scoring
system based on Bederson et al. (1986) was used: 0, no detectable deficits; 1, forelimb flexion and torso turning to the
contralateral side when lifted by the tail; 2, same behaviour as grade 1 and decreased resistance to a lateral
push; 3, same behaviour as grade 2 with unilateral circling;
4, no spontaneous walking and a depressed level of consciousness. Rats with a neurological deficit of less than 2 were excluded from the study.

Histological and Immunohistochemical Determination
of Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption and Total Neuron
Counts

in samples were determined using the method described by
Bradford (1976) and BSA was used to establish a standard
curve.

One hour before decapitation of the animal and transcardial
perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Evans Blue dye (100 mg/kg) was injected into the right jugular
vein. The third slice of brain tissue (corresponding to the
dorso-lateral striatum) was used to assess blood–brain barrier
(BBB) disruption based on extravasation of Evans Blue dye
from the blood circulation into the brain tissue and for immunohistochemical determination of the neuronal count (NeuN
positivity). Fixed and frozen brain tissue was sliced (thickness
30 μm) and assessed using a standard fluorescent microscope
(Olympus, magnification×20).
For expression of BBB disruption, the mean fluorescence
intensity of Evans Blue dye in pictures of the core and penumbra counted by Image J software was used (mean fluorescence intensity/image).
For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with
mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:400; Millipore) overnight at
4 °C and subsequently with fluorescent secondary Alexa 488
goat anti-mouse (1:200; Molecular Probes) antibodies for 2 h
at room temperature and then cover slipped for image analysis. Microphotographs were taken from the ipsilateral and
contralateral sides of the striatum (core and penumbra) with
a×20 objective and NeuN-positive cells were counted. The
localization of core and penumbra was established based on
Hata et al. (2000). The core region was localized in the central
part of infarcted tissue that is affected since very early ischaemia, the penumbra region close to the border of maximal
infarct volume in order to minimize effect of core overlay up
to 6 h of ischaemia.

Concentration of Glutamate

Tissue Processing for Western Blot Analysis
and Assessment of Glutamate Concentration
Regions corresponding to the core and penumbra from the
right (ipsilateral) and left (contralateral) hemispheres designated for biochemical analysis were dissected according to
Ashwal et al. (1998) with modification (Tsantes et al. 2013).
The core (striatum and overlying cortex) was separated from
the penumbra (adjacent cortex) by transverse diagonal cuts at
approximately the ‘2 o’clock’ and ‘5 o’clock’ positions (ipsilateral hemisphere) and the ‘10 o’clock’ and ‘7 o’clock’ positions (contralateral hemisphere), respectively.
Sections of the tissue were weighed and homogenized in
homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 50 mM magnesium
acetate, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA and 1 mM
DTT, pH 7.5 with added Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets,
Roche, Germany) and then centrifuged at 12,000g (15 min,
4 °C). Post-mitochondrial supernatants were aliquoted and
frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Total protein concentrations

Glutamate concentrations in the post-mitochondrial supernatants of core and penumbra tissue were measured by a modified enzymatic–fluorimetric method (Kravcukova et al. 2009)
based on an assay described in Graham and Aprison (1966).
First, aliquots of post-mitochondrial supernatant were thawed
and precipitated using cold 1 M PCA at a ratio of 1:19 and
centrifuged; the supernatant was then used for the glutamate
assay. Glutamate concentrations in the samples were determined by fluorimetric detection of NADH resulting from the
reaction of glutamate and NAD+ catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. The glutamate concentration is directly proportional to the concentration of NADH in a reaction. Briefly,
10 μl of supernatant was pipetted into a black 96-well plate,
and 190 μl of reaction buffer (0.25 M hydrazine hydrate/0.3M glycine buffer, pH 8.6) containing 200 nM NAD+ and 15 U
of glutamate dehydrogenase was added. After 30 min of incubation at RT, the fluorescence intensity of the final product
(NADH) was read on a Synergy™ 2 Multi-Mode Microplate
Reader (BioTek) at 460 nm with an excitation wavelength of
360 nm. The concentration of glutamate in tissue samples was
normalized in accordance with the total protein concentration
(μmol/mg of protein). All chemicals used for glutamate concentration measurements were purchased from Fluka.
Western Blot Analysis
Post-mitochondrial supernatants of equivalent protein content
(50 μg) were resolved by SDS/PAGE (15 % gel for cytochrome C and 12 % gel for the rest) and electroblotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Hybond-P
PVDF membrane, GE Healthcare). After a 1-h blocking of
non-specific binding sites with 5 % non-fat dry milk (5 %w/
v) in PBS Tween-20 (0.1 %v/v), the membranes were incubated overnight (4 °C) with primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome C (1:1000, Abcam plc.), rabbit polyclonal anti-active caspase 3 (1:1000, Abcam plc.), rabbit monoclonal anti-caspase 9 (1:3000, Abcam plc.), goat polyclonal antibeta actin (1:5000, Abcam plc.), rabbit Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) (1:5000, Enzo Life Sciences) and rabbit Cu/Zn
SOD (1:5000, Enzo Life Sciences). The membranes were
washed in PBS Tween-20 (0.1 %v/v) and then incubated with
secondary horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibody for
1 h at RT (1:10,000, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) HRP conjugated; goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L) HRP conjugated; donkey
anti-goat IgG (H&L) HRP conjugated, Agrisera). Bound antibody was revealed by means of enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate,

76

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 57:73–82

Thermo Scientific). The chemiluminescent signal was captured by a Fusion FX Chemiluminiscence system (Vilber
Lourmat), and quantification of band intensities was performed with densitometric measurement software for image
analysis (Bio-1D++, Vilber Lourmat). Results were expressed
as relative density values calculated by dividing the per cent
values in each row by the control sample’s per cent value (beta
actin).
Statistical Analysis
Data are calculated as the mean±SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett
post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results
Integrity of the Blood–Brain Barrier
The Evans Blue extravasation method for post-ischaemic determination of BBB condition was used. The integrity of the
BBB over the time course from 1 to 6 h of blood supply
restriction was the most affected in the core of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. We observed that fluorescence intensity in the
core was increased by about 476±77 % in the first hour and
up to 607±68 % 6 h after occlusion of the MCA. In the
penumbra region of the same hemisphere, significantly elevated emission of Evans Blue dye was detected 1 (235.7±66 %),
3 (280.5±53 %) and 6 (269.5±46 %) hours after blood supply
restriction (Fig. 1).
No significant rise in the fluorescence emission of EB dye
was detected in the core and penumbra of the contralateral
hemisphere (Fig. 1). The increasing intensity was more or less
homogenous in both regions during the whole time window of
ischaemia.
Neuron Counts
The number of NeuN-positive cells (neuron count) decreased
after initiating ischaemia in the whole brain, particularly in the
ischaemia core region (Fig. 2). The neuron count in the ischaemic core dropped gradually by about 81.9 % compared to
control by the sixth hour (neuron count in the control 1335±
75 NeuN-positive cells/mm2). A significant response to blood
supply restriction was also clearly detected in the penumbra of
the ipsilateral hemisphere after the first hour of occlusion.
The results of our experiments confirm that the ischaemic
condition affected the total neuron count in the dorso-lateral
striatum of the opposite, contralateral, hemisphere as well. Up
to 3 h of MCA occlusion produced a slight loss of NeuN
positivity (ranging from 1087.2 ± 78.6 to 1173.8 ± 80.5

in the quantity of neurons was seen after 6 h of brain ischaemia
(ranging from 856.7±101 NeuN-positive cells/mm2 in the
core to 917.5±98 NeuN-positive cells/mm2 in the penumbra).

Post-ischaemic Tissue Glutamate Concentration

(0.428±0.02 μmol/mg of protein). After 3 h of ischaemia,
the level of glutamic acid reached 0.462±0.04 μmol/mg of
protein and peaked at the sixth hour of MCA occlusion
(0.472±0.035 μmol/mg of protein).
Surprisingly, an impact of the ischaemic condition on the
contralateral hemisphere was detected. We observed elevated
levels of post-mitochondrial glutamate in the core as well as
the penumbra throughout the entire studied period, most significantly after 6 h of MCA restriction (Fig. 3). In the core, the
glutamate level rose by about 22.5 % (0.341±0.01 μmol/mg
of protein) 1 h after ischaemia induction and stayed almost
unchanged up to the third hour (0.335±0.032 μmol/mg of
protein). Similar values were also detected in the penumbra
region (0.342±0.005 μmol/mg of protein after the first hour of
ischaemia; 0.381±0.05 μmol/mg of protein at the third hour
of ischaemia). Six hours of MCA occlusion led to a significant
elevation of glutamic acid in the core (0.414±0.003 μmol/mg
of protein) as well as in the penumbra (0.381±0.021 μmol/mg
of protein) of this hemisphere.

No significant changes in glutamate content were observed in
post-mitochondrial supernatants from the core and penumbra
regions of either hemisphere in the control group (ranging
from 0.264±0.003 to 0.275±0.003 μmol/mg of protein);
however, significant changes in glutamate level were found
in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of the ischaemia groups (Fig. 3).
In the core of the injured brain site, glutamate concentration
rose rapidly by about 46 % (0.508±0.026 μmol/mg of protein) after 1 h of ischaemia and remained at approximately the
same level after 3 h (0.491±0.043 μmol/mg of protein). With
the passage of more time, after 6 h of MCA occlusion, the
glutamate content in the ischaemia core increased more than
2-fold compared to control (ischaemia 0 h) and reached 0.663
±0.023 μmol/mg of protein, i.e. an elevation of about 141 %.
In the penumbra of this hemisphere, glutamate levels increased within the first hour of ischaemia by about 42 %

Semiquantitative analysis of the CuZn SOD content in postmitochondrial supernatants of the penumbra and core confirmed the tissue enzyme antioxidant response to the ischaemic condition in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 4). In the
ischaemic core, the relative density of CuZn SOD decreased
significantly from 0.725±0.065 in the control to 0.433±0.034
in the experimental group of animals that were exposed to 6 h
of ischaemia. In the penumbra of the same hemisphere, the
content of this enzyme rose by about 34.5 % during the first

hour and stayed at approximately the same level up to the sixth
hour of ischaemia (1.267±0.123).
In contrast to this, CuZn SOD density in the contralateral
brain hemisphere differed only minimally compared to the
control. We observed only slight insignificant reductions of
CuZn SOD positivity in the core (by about 14.7 %) and penumbra (by about 10 %) after 6 h of reduced blood supply.

0.79 3 h and 3.9±0.72 6 h after MCA occlusion. Insignificant
changes in Mn SOD content (although elevated) were detected throughout the entire study period in the contralateral
hemisphere.

Mitochondrial Damage Evaluation

The first signals for apoptosis-linked enzymes in brain tissue
were observed after 3 h of MCAO occlusion. All of the enzymes were detected in both the ischaemia-affected and the
contralateral hemisphere as well (Fig. 6).

Over time, the blood restriction caused a release of mitochondrial Mn SOD enzyme from the mitochondria into the cell
cytosol of affected brain tissue due to mitochondrial membrane disruption. While there was no significant elevation in
the Mn SOD level in the whole brain (post-mitochondrial
supernatant, respectively) during the first hour of blood supply
restriction, in the ipsilateral hemisphere, its relative density
was increased significantly since the third hour (Fig. 5). Mn
SOD density in the ischaemic core rose more than 4.4-fold
since the third (2.62±0.47) up to the sixth hour (2.53±0.29) of
MCA occlusion. The level of this enzyme in the penumbra
was even higher, its relative density reaching values of 4.23±

Cytochrome C The highest density of this mitochondrial enzyme in mitochondria-free cell cytosol was detected in the
core region of the ischaemic hemisphere where it reached
values of 0.76±0.033 and 1.02±0.092 after 3 and 6 h, respectively. In the rest of the brain (including the contralateral hemisphere), the level of cytochrome C was approximately equal
(Fig. 6a) (i.e. after 3 h of MCA occlusion, the cytochrome C
density ranged from 0.45±0.1 in the ischaemic penumbra to
0.68±0.02 in the contralateral penumbra, and after 6 h, it

Discussion

Caspase 9 As in the previous section, caspase 9 positivity was
observed in the whole brain after both intervals of ischaemia
(Fig. 6b). The highest level of this enzyme was detected in the
ischaemic penumbra after 6 h of blood supply restriction (0.83
±0.19). Relatively stable (but lower) caspase 9 levels were
measured in the core of the ischaemia-affected hemisphere after
both periods (0.55±0.14 after 3 h and 0.59±0.72 after 6 h).
In the contralateral hemisphere, the content of caspase 9
rose continuously. The maximum enzyme density was detected after 6 h of MCA occlusion in the core region (0.5±0.1).
Caspase 3 The density of this enzyme started to rise after 3 h
of ischaemia (Fig. 6c). Caspase 3 positivity in the ischaemic
core reached a value of 0.887±0.1. The highest level during
this time interval was identified in the ischaemic penumbra
(1.3±0.3). After 6 h of MCA occlusion, caspase 3 content was
slightly decreased in the core (0.75±0.1) as well as in the
penumbra of the ischaemic hemisphere (1.5±0.41). Moreover, elevated levels of caspase 3 were observed in the contralateral brain hemisphere since the third hour of ischaemia,
beginning with a gentle increase in the core region followed
by a significant increase in the penumbra.

In the presented paper, we provide information about the pattern (scheme) of development of ischaemia-triggered agents
during brain infarct evolution. We monitored these agents
during three important time periods: (1) from the beginning
of ischaemia to 1 h of blood supply restriction, i.e. the time
with the largest extent of the penumbra and the greatest therapeutic potential, (2) 3 h of ischaemia, i.e. the time when the
ischaemic core grows continuously into the penumbra region
and (3) after 6 h of blood supply restriction, at which point the
core has reached its maximum extent (Hossmann 2008).
Obviously, the general validity of the data is limited by the
fixed localization of the core and penumbra during the dynamic process of infarct evolution (tissue section representing the
core and penumbra, respectively). In the present paper, the
core region was destined in the central part of infarcted tissue
that is affected since very early ischaemia, the penumbra close
to the border of maximal infarct volume. However, the penumbra region was designed in order to minimize the effect of
core overlay; this could be taken into account with ongoing
ischaemia, especially at ≥6 h of ischaemia when the penumbra
has successively disappeared (Hata et al. 2000). On the other
side, due to the infarct spreading, the core section has been
‘enriched’ from time period to time period.

One of the very first events after ischaemia initiation is
disruption of the blood–brain barrier, which contributes to
the cerebral infarction and the expansion of neuronal damage
(Liu et al. 2012). The BBB represents a normal and highly
effective way to protect sensitive brain tissue against different
harmful agents. After ischaemia, its integrity is affected,
resulting in penetration of inflammatory cells, highmolecular-weight molecules and fluid into the brain, causing
oedema and cell death (Fishman 1975). The simplest method
of studying BBB permeability is to measure tracer penetration
into the brain after peripheral injection. Evans Blue dye
(961 Da) is perhaps the most widely used in experimental
animals because of its ability to bind to serum albumin (69,
000 Da), thus representing a high-molecular-weight protein
tracer in the circulation (Saria and Lundberg 1983). Our results showed that the integrity of the BBB in the ischaemiaaffected hemisphere was strongly impaired after the first hour
of blood supply disruption and then remained in approximately the same condition with further passage of time. Moreover,
the neuron count in this region significantly decreased, especially in the infarct area. Taking into account the concept of
the ‘golden’ hour described above (in the context of improving post-ischaemic neuronal survival), we suggest that the
maintenance of blood–brain barrier integrity does not play a
crucial role in limiting the final infarct size, although its associated role in the development and progress of ischaemiainduced brain tissue damage cannot be questioned.
Another associated aspect of ischaemic brain tissue damage is glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Increased release of
glutamate into the extracellular spaces around neurons caused
by membrane depolarization leads to glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity due to overproduction of ROS and elevation of
oxidative stress (Arundine and Tymianski 2004; AbouSleiman et al. 2006). During permanent blockade of the
MCA, we observed increases in glutamate in the ischaemic
hemisphere after the first hour of occlusion. The highest level
of this excitotoxic agent was detected in the core region due to
the processes triggered by direct blood supply restriction,
while lower glutamate release was detected in penumbra tissue, partially supported via collaterals and the contralateral
hemisphere. Longer times of ischaemia led to a progressive
elevation of glutamate content, both directly in the ischaemic
core as well as in the rest of the brain, suggesting its role in
infarct expansion.
Elevated tissue glutamate content (as well as other agents
monitored in this study) in the peri-infarct area could be explained by the spread of cellular depolarization from the site of
origin through electrochemically neural tissue, i.e. by the
spreading depression. Spreading depression may be triggered

depression waves cause further reductions in tissue PO2 and
exacerbate metabolic stress–failure (Somjen 2001). In this
context, these waves are referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs), reflecting their pathogenic role and similarity to
anoxic depolarization. In focal cerebral ischaemia, PIDs cause
an expansion of core-infarcted tissue into adjacent penumbral
regions of reversible injury and have been shown to occur
through 6 h after injury. In permanent MCAO, PIDs occurred
in a biphasic pattern with a mean of 78 events over 2–24 h.
Parameters of secondary phase PID incidence correlated with
infarct volumes in transient and permanent ischaemia models
(Hartings et al. 2003).
SOD activity plays an indispensable role in the detoxification of superoxide radicals overproduced during and after an
ischaemic event and also plays an important role in the defence against ischaemic brain damage (Li et al. 1998; Kawase
et al. 1999; Danielisova et al. 2005). Measurement of the
cytoplasmic form of SOD in the ischaemic core showed a
gradual decline in density up to 6 h of MCA occlusion that
could be explained by protein synthesis blockade induced by
energy failure. In contrast to this, an elevated density of this
enzyme was detected in the penumbra region. This suggests a
greater requirement in the penumbra tissue for this antioxidant
enzyme, which is ensured by collateral support of sufficient
energy metabolism.
Three main components in the apoptotic machinery have
been highlighted in the present paper: cytochrome C, caspase
9 and caspase 3. Cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol of the cell, activating a cascade reaction
that leads to apoptotic cell death. During our study of infarct
evolution in the permanent model of MCAO, we were unable
to detect cytochrome C in post-mitochondrial supernatants
after the first hour of occlusion. This observation reflects continuing integrity of mitochondrial membrane up to the first
hour of ischaemia that was subsequently disrupted. From the
third hour of ischaemia, its density rose significantly onwards
in whole brain, especially in the ischaemic core. A downstream enzyme in the apoptotic cascade, caspase 9, was detectable from the third hour as well, reflecting its elevated
production and/or increased release from mitochondria. In
neuronal cell culture models as well as in animal models of
transient global cerebral ischaemia, caspase 9 release from
mitochondria and accumulation in nuclei were observed in
hippocampal and other vulnerable neurons exhibiting early
post-ischaemic changes preceding apoptosis (Krajewski
et al. 1999). In response to caspase 9, a similar pattern could
be seen in the tissue level of active caspase 3. Caspase 3, the
effector of the apoptotic signalling pathway, is expressed, activated, and cleaved in cerebral ischaemia. The active form of
caspase 3 is elevated in the process of apoptotic cell death
(Namura et al. 1998). In our experiment, we clearly confirmed
that the active form of caspase 3 was undetectable during the
first hour of ischaemia in whole brain. Starting in the third

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 57:73–82

hour of MCA occlusion, activation of this enzyme commenced in the ischaemia-damaged hemisphere and then was
more or less unchanged up to 6 h. The highest level of active
enzyme could be detected in the ischaemic penumbra, i.e.
expansion of the ischaemic core into the penumbra caused
by prolonged occlusion time could be expected.
One of the events reflecting serious cell damage in brain
tissue caused by prolonged ischaemia is mitochondrial damage. In this experiment, the presence of the mitochondrial
isoform of SOD in the cell cytosol was studied as a marker
of mitochondrial membrane disruption. Based on our results,
we can state that ischaemia did not affect mitochondria membrane integrity up to 1 h of blood supply restriction. Similar to
the apoptosis-associated enzymes described above, significantly increased release of Mn SOD from mitochondria into
the cell cytoplasm was detected since the third hour of ischaemia. These results may be connected to a progressive reduction in the number of dorso-lateral striatum neurons. Interestingly, the highest level of Mn SOD was cumulated in the
penumbra region. This observation may suggest progressive
mitochondrial damage in ischaemia-affected brain tissue, but,
taking into account mitochondria as a possible source of certain cytosolic enzymes, it would explain the rapid elevation in
concentration of cytochrome C and caspase 9 in the cell
cytosol as well. Noshita et al. (2001) suggested that Mn
SOD might affect cytochrome C translocation and downstream caspase activation in the mitochondrial-dependent cell
death pathway after transient focal brain ischaemia in a mouse
model. Two hours after reperfusion, cytochrome C and caspase 9 were observed in the cytosol and were significantly
increased in Mn SOD-deficient mutants compared with
wild-type mice. Therefore, we expect that this mechanism
could contribute to accelerating apoptotic processes during
ongoing ischaemia (beyond the first hour of ischaemia) and
thus in the rapid non-linear expansion of the ischaemic core.
Additionally, our results clearly confirm that the final effect
of MCA blockade of one hemisphere produces a whole brain
response. Given that there are some literature reports
connecting transient focal ischaemia to contralateral changes
(listed below), we provide evidence about similar dramatic
changes in a model of permanent focal ischaemia. Redecker
et al. (2002) reported the occurrence of various functional
alterations within structurally intact brain regions ipsilateral
and contralateral to the focal ischaemia. These changes were
termed remote effects. Remote contralateral effects were attributed to the extensive interhemispheric connections that
exist in the rat cortex.
In the present paper, we provide evidence about the decreased total number of neurons in the whole contralateral
hemisphere after the first hour of ischaemia, with maximal
elimination of NeuN-positive cells 6 h after the attack. Despite
this, we were unable to detect degenerating neurons
(FloroJade B staining) at this time point even in the ipsilateral

site (data not included). The integrity of the BBB was slightly
disrupted and allowed penetration of high-molecular-weight
complexes of Evans Blue dye–serum albumin into brain tissue. Glutamate content rose as well, especially late in ischaemia. In contrast to this, the density of the antioxidant enzyme
CuZn SOD decreased only slightly in this hemisphere.
The pathological changes in remote brain areas likely indicate chronic ischaemic diaschisis, which should be considered
in developing treatment strategies for stroke (Garbuzova-Davis et al. 2014). The authors have observed significant extravasation of Evans Blue dye 30 days after transient MCAO and
registered several ultrastructural changes in the motor cortex
and striatum of this hemisphere, including vacuolated endothelial cells with large autophagosomes, degenerated pericytes
displaying mitochondria with cristae disruption, degenerated
astrocytes and perivascular oedema and the appearance of
parenchymal astrogliosis. The authors suggest that this vascular damage in remote brain areas opposite to the initial stroke
insult might indicate ongoing pathological vascular changes in
association with chronic diaschisis. As could be expected
from the results described above, Dief and co-workers
(2008) observed apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells 7 days after
transient MCAO. Although we did not study the direct appearance of apoptotic cells in the contralateral site, our work provides evidence about markers linked to apoptosis. After the
third hour of permanent blockade of the blood supply to the
right MCA, there were elevated levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome C, caspase 9 and the active form of caspase 3 in the
core as well as in the penumbra of the contralateral (left)
hemisphere.
In conclusion, we can summarize that the basis for the
‘golden hour’ phenomenon could be the preserved integrity
of mitochondrial membrane and the incompletely developed
process of apoptosis. During the first hour of ischaemia, we
did not detect the appearance of certain enzymes typical of the
apoptotic pathway; however, the direct expression of other
ischaemia-linked changes (disrupted BBB and increased glutamate level) was also detectable in this early period of MCA
occlusion. The apoptotic pathway was clearly developed after
3 h of ischaemia when the mitochondrial enzyme release in
cell cytoplasm was detected. We suppose that the activated
apoptotic pathway could be connected to the relatively low
potential of therapeutic intervention after this point. Moreover,
the present results indicate the remote effect of an ischaemic
insult manifested in direct morphological changes in BBB
integrity as well as changes in intracellular signalling connected to apoptosis after prolonged brain ischaemia.
