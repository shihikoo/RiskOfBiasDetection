SUMMARY
Aims: Preconditioning is promising for treating cerebral ischemic stroke. Annexin A1
(ANXA1) is a homeostatic antiinflammatory mediator that participates in countering
against ischemic injuries. We investigated whether chloral hydrate preconditioning (CH)
exerts neuroprotection via regulation of ANXA1 in stroke. Methods: Adult male C57BL/6J
mice or ANXA1 knockout (ANXA1 / ) mice were randomly allocated to control (NCH) and
CH groups [2%, 6%, and 10% chloral hydrate (i.p.) 1 h before the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO)]. Neurological performances were evaluated by modified 7-point neurological scales and rotarod test. Cerebral infarction was analyzed by triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining and MRI. The expression of ANXA1, pro-inflammatory (TNF-a,
IL-1b, IL-6), and antiinflammatory (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-b) cytokines was investigated by RTPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Results: Chloral hydrate preconditioning significantly improved the neurological outcomes and reduced the infarction and brain edema
after ischemia. In addition, CH increased the expression of ANXA1 in the microglia,
decreased the levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6, while elevated the levels of IL-4, IL-10, and
TGF-b in the MCAO mice. Furthermore, both ANXA1 blocker Boc1 (5 mg/kg, i.c.v.) or
ANXA1 gene deficiency restrained the protective effects of CH against stroke. Conclusions:
Chloral hydrate preconditioning protects against ischemic injuries through upregulating the
expression of ANXA1, and the followed antiinflammatory mechanisms.

Introduction
Preconditioning can induce remarkable tolerance against cerebral
ischemic stroke, indicates that the brain has the potential for selfprotection [1]. Therefore, the induction of endogenous neuroprotection could be used as a strategy for treating stroke. Preconditioning can be induced by hypoxia, inflammatory mediators,
anesthetics, and so on [2]. Early work showed that general anesthetics can offer tolerance against cerebral ischemia [3–5].
Chloral hydrate is a well-known sedative and anesthetic that is
applied in pediatric procedures, such as echocardiograms, magnetic resonance imaging [6,7], and in animal experiments [8]. It
was demonstrated that chloral hydrate could delay and reduce the

718

magnitude of the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory
response in mice [9]. Ischemic stroke are characterized by rapid
inflammatory responses and the followed neuronal death. Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is an antiinflammatory molecule in the host
defense system [10] and the nervous system [11]. Evidences demonstrate ANXA1 can play protective role in the central nervous
system against ischemia [12]. However, whether ANXA1 in the
brain mediates the protective effects of chloral hydrate against
ischemic stroke is still unknown.
This study was undertaken to investigate whether chloral
hydrate preconditioning could induce a potential neuroprotective
effect via upregulating the expression of ANXA1 and the followed
antiinflammatory effects in ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Animals
A total of 122 C57BL/6J wild-type male mice (3 months old,
25  2 g) were used in the whole experiments and randomly
allocated to the preconditioned group or non-preconditioned
(control) group. The generation of ANXA1 / (n = 46) and
ANXA1+/+ (n = 48) mice was described previously [13]. All the
animals were fed on a standard chow pellet diet with tap water
ad libitum. All procedures were conducted with the approval of
the Animal Ethics Committee of Huazhong University of Science
and Technology, Wuhan, China.

Chloral Hydrate Preconditioning and Focal
Cerebral Ischemia
In the chloral hydrate preconditioning (CH) group, animals were
injected intraperitoneally with 2%, 6%, or 10% chloral hydrate
(0.1 mL/10 g bodyweight) 1 h before anesthesia for surgery. Saline vehicle was injected as the nonchloral hydrate preconditioning control group (NCH). During surgery, animals were
anesthetized with 4% halothane, then maintained with mechanical ventilation (0.5% halothane in a mixture of 70% N2O and
30% O2, 3.5 ml/cycle, 28 cycle/min). The blood gas values were
kept at stable levels (PCO2, 35  3 mm Hg; PO2, 120  10 mm
of Hg), and the rectal temperature was maintained at 37.5 
0.5°C throughout the surgery. In addition, heating pad was used
to maintain the animal’s body temperature at 37  0.5°C. After
surgery, animals were allowed to wake up in an incubator
and then recover in individual cage. BLF21C Laser Doppler flow
meter and LL-M1043 fiber flow-probe (Transonic System Inc,
Ithaca, NY, USA) were used to monitor brain blood flow. Adequate anesthesia was ascertained by no withdrawal response to a
paw pinch.
The mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Briefly, a
surgical monofilament (7/0) with rounded tip was inserted
into the left internal carotid through the external carotid
stump, and past the carotid bifurcation (advanced 10–13 mm).
Occlusion was confirmed when blood flow was reduced by at
least 80% of the baseline. The filament was left in place for
60 min and then withdrawn. The sham (control) animals
were performed identically, except that the suture was not
introduced into the artery after neck incision. Animals that
died within 24 h after reperfusion were excluded in our
analysis.

logical deficits. Score were ranked from 0 to 7 at an interval
of 1.0.
An accelerating rotarod test was applied to detect the motor
coordination. Mice were placed on the rungs (9 cm diameter,
5 rpm) of the rotarod, and the latency to fall was measured for up
to 2 min. A trial ended if the mouse fell off, or gripped and spun
around for complete revolution. Mice were adapted to the rotarod
for five trials per day for 2 days before surgery. Each mouse
underwent testing every day for up to 7 days after surgery. Mice
were underwent five trials on each day of testing, with an interval
of 1 min. The data are expressed as the percentage of mean duration to baseline value per day. Neurological performance was
always assessed by the blinded independent investigators.

Infarct Volume Assessment
Three days after MCAO, mice were sacrificed and brains were
removed quickly and frozen at 20°C for 20 min. Coronal slices
(six to seven slices from each mouse) were made at 1 mm interval
from rostral to caudal direction. Slices were immersed in 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37°C for 20 min and
avoid light. The infarctions were determined by examining TTCstained slices for the areas that did not stain with TTC.

Assessment of Cerebral Edema
Mice subjected to 60 min of MCAO received CH or NCH 1 h
before ischemia onset, then were sacrificed at 24 h after MCAO.
Brain hemispheres were isolated and weighed rapidly (“wet”
weight). Hemispheres were dehydrated over 24 h at 100 °C and
then reweighed (“dry” weight). Water content was used to
express cerebral edema and calculated as a percentage of wet
weight (wet weight dry weight)/(wet weight) 9 100%.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Before MRI scanning, mice were anesthetized (5% isoflurane for
induction and 1.5% isoflurane for maintenance) and body temperature was maintained at 37°C, with continuous monitoring of
respiratory rate (RR). If the mouse’s RR is stable (around 50
breaths per minute), MRI was then performed on a Bruker 7T
(70/30) machine (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA) utilizing
quadrature surface received and volume transmit coil setup.
T2-weighted coronal images were acquired using RARE
(TR = 4200, TE = 12, RARE factor 8, 1 mm, FOV 2.4 cm,
256 9 256). Four b values (b = 0, 100, 200, 1000) were acquired
with a matrix size of 128 9 128 9 15, and slice thickness is
1.0 mm.

Measurement of Neurological Outcome
The neurological deficits were assessed as early as 24 h
throughout 7 days after the insults. Neurological performance
was scored at day 7 using modified 7-point neurological scales
as follows: 7, no spontaneous motor activity/death; 6, longitudinal spinning; 5, leaning to the ipsilateral side at rest; 4, rolling to the ipsilateral side; 3, circling to the ipsilateral side; 2,
circling to the ipsilateral side but normal posture at rest; 1,
flexion of the contralateral torso; and 0, no observable neuro-

Double Immunofluorescence Staining
Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China)
and transcardially perfused with normal saline, followed by cold
4% paraformaldehyde (0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, 4°C). The brain was
removed, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then
treated with 30% sucrose (in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4) till brain sink to
the bottom of the container. Cryosections (30 lm) were cut,

mounted on slides, and stored at 20°C. Mounted brain sections
were thawed at room temperature (RT), and subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence to detect ANXA1 and Iba-1. Sections were
blocked with donkey serum for 1 h, and then incubated with rabbit anti-ANXA1 (sc-11387, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and mouse anti-Iba-1 polyclonal antibodies
(ab107159, 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 48 h. FITCand TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were
incubated for 1 h at RT. The sections were observed under a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with an
omnichrome air-cooled helium/neon laser tuned to produce emissions at 488 and 568 nm.

Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain
Reaction
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was applied to analyze the effects of CH on the mRNA levels of
ANXA1, IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-b in mouse brain.
The RNA was extracted according to the instructions of RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The RNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (ND-1000,
Thermo Scientific). RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect
SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (lot. no. 204143; Qiagen) on a real-time
PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The PCR cycle was run as follows: 95°C/15 min, 40 cycles of 95°C/15 s, annealing at appropriate temperature/45 s, 72°C/1 min. The melt curve was analyzed
to verify that only a single product per primer was amplified. The
gene expression was calculated by the delta-delta Ct method [14].
The PCR primers, annealing temperature, and product’s size are
shown in Table S1. The results were expressed as fold changes in
the target gene normalized to reference gene GAPDH.

Western Blot Analysis
Animals were sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation. The brain tissues were quickly removed and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
cholic acid, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mg/mL leupeptin,
1 mg/ml pepstatin and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).
The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C
to yield the total protein extract in the supernatant. The protein
concentrations were measured according to the previously
described methods [15]. Each lysate (40 lg) was separated on
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Bio-Rad) using a semidry electrotransfer system (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, rabbit polyclonal anti-ANXA1 (sc-11387,
1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit
polyclonal anti-IL-1b (sc-7884, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-6 (ab6672, 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-TNFa (#3707, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), goat polyclonal anti-IL-4
(sc-1260, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnolog), rabbit polyclonal antiIL-10 (ab34843, 1:500, Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF-b
(#3711, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology). Then the PVDF membranes were washed and incubated with corresponding secondary

antibodies. To control the loading differences in total protein
amounts, antibody to protein b-actin (42 kDa, 1:5000; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was used. The signal and intensity of the band
on the PVDF membrane were detected using Odyssey system
(Li-Cor Bioscience, Lincoln, NB, USA).

Statistical Analysis
All variance values in the study are represented as mean  SEM.
Statistical analyses were conducted by the software SPSS 13.0
(Chicago, IL, USA). Neurological score, infarct volume, number
of positive staining cells, mortality, water content, qRT-PCR, and
Western blotting data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) tests.
Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare
the survival rate and retention time in Rotarod tests among all
groups. The two factors were days after MCAO and Treatment.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all cases.

Results
Chloral Hydrate Preconditioning Significantly
Improved Functional Outcomes and Reduced
Brain Injury
To validate the effects of CH on stroke, we subjected the mice with
2%, 6%, and 10% CH on MCAO mice and performed the followed behavioral and histological studies after reperfusion at indicated time points (Figure 1A). Animals with 2% CH showed
higher survival rate (Figure 1B), less mortality (P < 0.05, Fig.
S1A), and better neurological score (P < 0.05, Figure 1C)
throughout the 7-day observation period. In addition, CH significantly reduced infarct volume (32.4  2.6 mm3) at day 7 reperfusion after MCAO compared with the NCH group
(47.9  4.3 mm3) (P < 0.05, Figure 1D). Another group of mice
were used and treated with CH or NCH at 24 h reperfusion after
MCAO to assess brain edema. Water content does not differ significantly in the contralateral hemisphere among the groups, but
CH-treated animals (78.4  4.2%) in the ipsilateral hemisphere
do have a marked decrease in water content as compared to NCH
group (87.2  6.1%) (P < 0.05, Figure S1B). Thus, 2% CH
improved overall neurological functions and reduced brain injury
in stroke and 2% could be used as an effective concentration in
the following studies.

Chloral Hydrate Preconditioning Promotes
ANXA1 Expression in the Brain
Given that preconditioning can upregulate ANXA1, we then
detected whether CH can increase the numbers of ANXA1
immunopositive cells in the mouse brain after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry showed that, compared with the control group
(6.7  1.2), CH increased the amounts of ANXA1/Iba-1 immunopositive neurons (32.3  2.7) in the brain 24 h after reperfusion
(P < 0.01, Figure 2A). Both RT-PCR and Western blot experiments confirmed that the expression of ANXA1 was significantly
increased in the CH group (2.8 fold for mRNA level, 3.7 fold for
protein level) than the NCH group (P < 0.05, Figure 2B,C).

Chloral Hydrate Preconditioning decreases ProInflammatory Cytokines
Neuroinflammation is the preceding pathogenesis to produce
brain injury in stroke. IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a are the important
proinflammatory cytokines involved in neuroinflammation. We
therefore determined the effects of CH on the expression of IL-1b,
IL-6, and TNF-a in the stroke brain tissues. qRT-PCR results
showed that IL-1b mRNA was decreased 3.7-fold, IL-6 mRNA was
decreased 5.9-fold, and TNFa mRNA was decreased 7-fold in CH
group compared with NCH group (P < 0.05, Figure S2A). Immunoblotting experiments also revealed the visible decreases in the
levels of IL-1b (2.7-fold), IL-6 (2.2-fold), and TNFa (3.9-fold) after
ischemia with CH compared with NCH group (P < 0.05, Figure 3A). Collectively, this verifies a robust neuroinflammatory
response in our focal ischemic model. These results suggest that
CH may alleviate ischemia-induced inflammation by decreasing
the levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

Antiinflammatory Cytokines
IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-b are the main antiinflammatory cytokines
associated with attenuating neuroinflammation in stroke. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether CH can alter the levels

of these antiinflammatory cytokines after ischemia. Either mRNA
or protein levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-b were detectable with
limited increases in mice brain tissue in MCAO group compared
with sham group (Figure S2B). However, MCAO mice with CH
showed apparent increase in the mRNA levels of IL-4 (3.9-fold),
IL-10 (5.1-fold), and TGF-b (5.5-fold) compared with NCH group
(P < 0.05, Figure S2B). Consistent with the qRT-PCR results, Western blot data also showed obvious increase in the protein levels of
IL-4 (2.8-fold), IL-10 (2.4-fold), and TGF-b (4.5-fold) in the
CH-treated MCAO mice (P < 0.05, Figure 3B). The changes of
these protein levels were not found in the NCH group (Figure 3B).
Taken together, CH may relieve ischemia-associated neuroinflammation by promoting antiinflammatory cytokines generation.

ANXA1 Antagonist Boc1 Blocks the Protection
Role of Chloral Hydrate Preconditioning in
Ischemic Stroke
Boc1 is a selective blocker of ANXA1 receptor. Next, we hope to
investigate whether the administration of Boc1 in the brain can
block the effects of CH. We administered a single dose of 1, 5, or
10 mg/kg Boc1 with 2 lL or vehicle (saline) into the intracerebral
ventricle (i.c.v.) with CH. Then, we operated mice with MCAO for
60 min and then 24 h after reperfusion (Figure 4A). At a dose of 5
and 10 mg/kg (i.c.v.), Boc1, but not saline, effectively inhibited

Genetic Deletion of ANXA1 Eliminates the
Protective Roles of Chloral Hydrate
Preconditioning Against Stroke Damages
Next, we used ANXA1 gene knockout (ANXA1 / ) mice in our
studies to further confirm CH produces its protective effects against
stroke via upregulating ANXA1. All animals appeared normal and
generated healthy ANXA1 / offspring. No differences can be
observed between the ANXA1 / and wild-type control littermates
(ANXA1+/+) in terms of gross physical appearance (Figure S4A),
body weight gain (Figure S4B), motor coordination (Figure S4C),
and cerebral blood flow (Figure S4D). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of ANXA1 was absent in ANXA1 / mice brain
(Figure S4E). ANXA1 mRNA by RT-PCR (Figure S4F) and ANXA1
protein by immunoblotting (Figure S4F) was not detected in
ANXA1 / mice brain. These results confirmed that the deletion of
ANXA1 gene exerted no phenotypic changes on mice.

found that Boc1 [5 mg/kg (i.c.v.)] sufficiently inhibited
(43.6  3.7 mm3) the reduction in the cerebral infarction by CH
(28.5  2.9 mm3) (P < 0.05, Figure S3). Together, these data suggest that ANXA1 blocker Boc1 can restrain the neuroprotective
effects of CH against stroke damages.

Next, we treated the ANXA1 / and ANXA1+/+ mice with CH
and subjected to MCAO for 60 min. MRI study was then performed 24 h after ischemic reperfusion. The MRI results showed
distinctly increased infarction area in ANXA1 /
mice
(52.8  5.1 mm3) as compared to ANXA1+/+ mice (42.6 
2.2 mm3) (P < 0.05, Figure 5A). CH could significantly reduce
the infarction area in ANXA1+/+ mice (25  2.4 mm3), but not
ANXA1 / mice (41.3  2.8 mm3) (Figure 5A). The improvement and the recovery of the motor coordination in the rotarod
test by CH were only seen in ANXA1+/+ mice (P < 0.05), but not
ANXA1 / mice (Figure 5B). Moreover, the significant increase
in IL-1b (4.8-fold), IL-6 (6.9-fold), and TNF-a (11.4-fold) proteins
can be observed in ANXA1 / mice as compared to ANXA1+/+
mice (P < 0.05, Figure 5C). CH treatment significantly reduced
these proinflammatory cytokines in ANXA1+/+ mice subjected to
MCAO (P < 0.05), but not in ANXA1 / mice (Figure 5C). In
addition, the obvious increases in IL-4 (4.1-fold), IL-10 (5.3-fold),
and TGF-b (4.3-fold) protein levels were observed in CH-treated
ANXA1+/+ MCAO mice (P < 0.05, Figure 5D), but not in CH-treated ANXA1 / MCAO mice (Figure 5D). Thus, ANXA1 is necessary for CH to produce its neuroprotective role.

Conclusion
Stroke is the primary cause of disability and mortality; however, effective treatments are still lacking. Preconditioning has
been considered as one of the most promising antistroke

strategies in the near future [16]. Evidences suggest that preconditioning can trigger various molecular signaling and generate effectors that contribute to the neural protection in
ischemic stroke [1]. It has been reported that anesthetic preconditioning as a potential strategy can provide protection to
the brain against ischemic injury [17]. In the present study,
we provide the confidential evidences revealed that chloral
hydrate preconditioning could induce neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia through upregulating ANXA1, and
promoting ANXA1’s antiinflammatory effects against neural
inflammation in stroke.
Chloral hydrate was widely and traditionally used as an anesthetic drug in the animal studies in laboratory [18]. Recently,
some researchers reported that due to the chloral hydrate’s dermatologic, cardiologic, ophthalmologic, and neuropsychiatric
responses [19], chloral hydrate should be replaced by other anesthetic drugs [20] and is not an appropriate choice for anesthesia of
small animals [4]. This makes us to rethink the biological roles of
the traditional drug. Here, we found that the lower dose (2%) of
chloral hydrate (10 ml kg/body weight, i.p.) administered 1 h
before cerebral ischemia induced protection against stroke dam-

ages. These results revealed that CH could be used as an effective
measure to treat ischemic stroke. Supplementing the previous
reports that the volatile anesthetics, such as isoflurane, sevoflurane, halothane, and desflurane, have been demonstrated to provide significant protection against cerebral ischemia [21–23], our
study shows chloral hydrate can be regarded as another neuroprotective anesthetic against stroke. The report that chloral hydrate
reduced the inflammatory response and improved the consequence of mice following liver injury indirectly backs up our study
[9].
Inflammation and cytokines are intimately associated with
stroke-induced cerebral injury. Induction of brain ischemic tolerance by preconditioning influences the expression of different
molecules [24]. For example, in both experimental models and
patients following acute ischemic stroke, the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines has been detected
[25,26]. Furthermore, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines
are associated with greater cerebral infarct size and poorer clinical
outcome in patients [27,28]. Our study showed that CH could
reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and
TNF-a) after stroke, those are consistent with the previous study

that IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a mRNA levels are decreased following
ischemic preconditioning [24]. In acute hyperoxic lung injury rabbit model, pretreatment with an intravenous administration of
lidocaine at a therapeutic dose observably reduced the release of
IL-1b and TNF-a from the injured lung tissue [29]. In addition, we
also found CH upregulated both the mRNA and protein levels of
antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-b) after ischemic injury. These data are in consistent with previous reports that
rats treated with preconditioning showed increased IL-10 and
TGF-b in the early phase of hypoxia [24,30–32]. The upregulation
of IL-4 by CH might be another key event for CH to exert its protective role against stroke because IL-4 can promote tissue repair
by exerting its neuroprotective role, and IL-4 deficiency exacerbates ischemic brain injuries and neurological impairments in
mice [33].
ANXA1 is a potent inhibitor in both acute and chronic inflammation [34,35], with a significant efficacy on leukocyte/endothelium interactions promoted by ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)
procedures [36]. Evidence showed an ANXA1 fragment (188amino acid long) was protective in a rat model of cerebral ischemia [37]. Other studies also confirmed the protective role for
ANXA1 in the brain after ischemia [12,38]. We found CH could
reduce brain injury after ischemia through upregulating the
expression of ANXA1. Meanwhile, using ANXA1 blocker Boc1
(5 mg/kg) or ANXA1 / mice, we further support the conclusion
that ANXA1 is necessary for CH to produce its antiinflammatory
and neuroprotective roles. Moreover, in ANXA1 / mice, the
development of arthritis is accompanied by increased expression
of IL-1 and IL-6, suggesting that ANXA1 is intimately associated
with inflammatory response [13]. A recent study has shown that
ANXA1 is able to affect microglial activation, migration, and cyto-

kines releasing through transferring microglia into an antiinflammatory M2 phenotype and protects neurons from ischemia-like
injury [39]. Our present study demonstrated that CH preconditioning could increase ANXA1 expression in the microglia. Taken
these results together, it may provide indirect evidence that CH
preconditioning could alter microglia functions via increasing
ANXA1 expression. Therefore, we supposed that the antiinflammatory effects of CH might be exerted through ANXA1 to reduce
the synthesis of inflammatory factors. The present study did not
indicate how CH regulates ANXA1 during ischemic stroke. Our
future research will address the involved molecular mechanisms.
In conclusion, our results show chloral hydrate preconditioning
could counteract cerebral ischemia-induced brain damages and
inflammation via upregulation of ANXA1. These observations
indicate that chloral hydrate preconditioning could be used as a
promising strategy for stroke treatment.
