INTRODUCTION
Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide
(Mozaﬀarian et al., 2014), and in most cases it is caused
by cerebral artery occlusion (ischemic stroke). The subsequent ischemic brain injury is the result of interactions
among complex pathophysiological processes such as
excitotoxicity, calcium dysregulation, oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, and apoptosis (Moskowitz et al., 2010).
Therefore, treatment with neuroprotectants that target
the main pathogenic mechanisms is a potential ischemic
stroke therapy (Wahlgren and Lyden, 2000).
Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor encoded by
the NRG1 gene that can be alternatively spliced into six
proteins (I–VI) (Falls, 2003; Steinthorsdottir et al., 2004;
Harrison and Law, 2006; Tan et al., 2007). Mature
NRG1 is diﬀusible with the exception of type III NRG1
(Mei and Xiong, 2008), and all NRG1 isoforms contain
an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain that signals
by stimulating ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (Bublil and
Yarden, 2007). ErbB4 is the only autonomous ErbB
kinase that can both bind NRG1 and become activated
as a homodimer. NRG1-ErbB4 signaling has been implicated in neuronal migration, axon guidance, glial cell
development, axon myelination, axon ensheathment,
and synapse formation in development, as well as synaptic plasticity in the adult brain (Mei and Xiong, 2008; Chen
et al., 2010; Mei and Nave, 2014). Moreover, there are
reports demonstrating that NRG1 can protect neurons
against ischemic injury (Shyu et al., 2004; Guo et al.,
2006; Xu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Croslan et al.,
2008) and NRG1 neuroprotection involves the inhibition
of pro-inﬂammatory responses and the PI3K/Akt pathway
(Shyu et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004, 2005; Guo et al., 2006;
Croslan et al., 2008), but whether the neuroprotection is
via NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is unclear.
c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the dominant inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous
system (CNS). GABA is synthesized by two isoforms of
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67)
(Soghomonian and Martin, 1998). GAD67 appears to be
distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm (Soghomonian
and Martin, 1998) and is a useful marker of GABAcontaining neurons. Increasing GABAergic neurotransmisson is known to reduce cerebral ischemia-induced
neuronal apoptosis (Schwartz et al., 1995; SchwartzBloom et al., 1998; Schwartz-Bloom and Sah, 2001;
Costa et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2008; DeFazio et al.,
2009). Interestingly, ErbB4 is expressed speciﬁcally in
GABAergic neurons, and NRG1 promotes GABA release

Abstract—Identifying novel neuroprotectants that can halt or
even reverse the eﬀects of stroke is of interest to both clinicians and scientists. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is an eﬀective neuroprotectant, but its molecular mechanisms are largely
unclear. In this study, NRG1 rescued cortical neurons from
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model, but the eﬀect
was blocked by neutralizing NRG1 and ErbB4 inhibition. In
addition, c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists
had no synergistic eﬀect with NRG1, and the neuroprotective
eﬀect of NRG1 against OGD was partly blocked by GABA
receptor antagonists. Importantly, NRG1 neuroprotection
against brain ischemia was abolished in the mice with speciﬁc deletion of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. In summary, NRG1 protects against ischemic brain
injury via ErbB4 receptors by enhancing GABAergic
transmission. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

via stimulating ErbB4 receptors (Woo et al., 2007;
Vullhorst et al., 2009; Buonanno, 2010; Mei and Nave,
2014). So it is possible that NRG1 neuroprotection may
be mediated by ErbB4 receptors on GABAergic neurons.
In this study, we addressed this issue and found that
NRG1-mediated neuroprotection is via NRG1-ErbB4 signaling by increasing GABAergic transmission.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics statement
Experiments and animal use procedures were conducted
in accordance with the Chinese Council on Animal Care
Guidelines (Zhu et al., 2010). Eﬀorts were made to minimize animal suﬀering and to reduce the number of animals used.

2.5 lM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for 48 h. The
neuronal cell cultures were used from in vitro days 11 to 12.
Immunocytochemistry
Neurons were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min
at room temperature and washed three times in
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) buﬀer. Fixed cultures
were blocked by incubation in PBS with 10% normal
bovine serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 at room
temperature for 1 h. Cultures were subsequently
incubated with GAD67 antibody (1:500) overnight at
4 °C. Cultures were washed three times with PBS, and
then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated antimouse IgG (1:400) for 1 h at room temperature or
overnight at 4 °C. Cultures were used with DAPI for
counterstaining. Neurons were visualized using
ﬂuorescence microscopy.

Reagents and animals
ecto-ErbB4 was puriﬁed as described previously (Woo
et al., 2007). The NRG1 used was a recombinant
polypeptide containing the entire EGF domain of the
b-type NRG1 (rHRG b177–244) and was purchased
from Prospec. AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA, USA); muscimol (mus), baclofen (bac),
Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide (PI), and cytosine arabinoside were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA); bicuculline (BMI) and GCP52432 were from
Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK); DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) and DNAse I were obtained from Roche
(Basel, Switzerland); the GAD67 antibody (MAB5045)
was purchased from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt,
Germany); Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG
was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA); fetal bovine
serum (FBS) was ordered from Hyclone (Logan, UT,
USA); Neurobasal-A medium, B-27 supplement, GlutaMAX, glutamine 0.25% trypsin–EDTA, penicillin, and
streptomycin were purchased from GIBCO (Grand
Island, NY, USA); and plasmocin was from InvivoGEN
(San Diego, CA, USA). parvalbumin (PV)-Cre mice were
crossed with LoxP-ﬂanked ErbB4 mice to generate
PV-ErbB4/ mice, with PV-ErbB4 +/+ mice as a control
(Chen et al., 2010).
Primary cortical neuronal culture
Primary rat cortical neurons were prepared from 1-dayold Sprague–Dawley rats. Brieﬂy, cerebral cortices were
maintained in Hanks’ buﬀered salt solution at 4 °C
during dissection. After the meninges and blood vessels
were removed, cells were digested with 0.25% trypsinEDTA (1 mg/ml) and DNAse I (10 lg/ml) at 37 °C for
10 min. The digestion was terminated with Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle medium (GIBCO) containing 10% FBS
(Hyclone). The cells were pooled via centrifugation and
resuspended in Neurobasal-A medium (GIBCO)
supplemented with 2% B-27 (GIBCO), 2 mM glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin. Cortical
neurons were plated onto 48-well plates pre-coated with
25 lg/ml poly-L-lysine at a density of 5  105 cells/well
and maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator (37 °C with 5%
CO2). On the third day, the cells were cultured with

Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment
The cortical neuronal cell cultures were used from in vitro
days 11 to 12. For OGD, glucose-free Earl’s balanced salt
solution (EBSS) medium (in mg/l: 6800 NaCl, 400 KCl,
264 CaCl2 * 2H2O, 200 MgCl2 * 7H2O, 2200 NaHCO3,
140 NaH2PO4 * H2O; pH 7.2) was purged with N2/CO2
(95%/5%) for 20 min, resulting in an oxygen content of
1%. Cortical neuronal cell cultures were then washed
three times with glucose-free EBSS medium and
incubated for 4 h in oxygen-free N2/CO2 (95%/5%) gas
(Wang et al., 2010). For reoxygenation, cells were incubated in fresh Neurobasal-A-medium with 2% B-27 supplement at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and atmospheric air for
24 h. The control group was incubated in EBSS with
10 mM glucose in a standard incubator. All drugs treatments were at the beginning of reoxygenation (0 h).
Evaluation of cortical neuronal death
At 24 h after OGD onset, cortical neuronal cell cultures
were stained with ﬂuorescent dyes Hoechst 33342
(10 lg/ml) for 10 min and PI (5 lg/ml) for additional
5 min at 37 °C. Hoechst 33342 is membrane permeable
and stains the nuclei of living cells, but PI is membrane
impermeable and stains only the DNA of cells with
disrupted plasma membranes. Cells in 3–6 independent
microscopic ﬁelds under blinded trial conditions were
visualized on a ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with
ﬁlters for Hoechst 33342 (excitation: 400 nm, emission:
420 nm) and PI (excitation: 570 nm, emission: 590 nm).
Images of both ﬂuorescence excitations were merged in
Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (San Jose, CA, USA), with double
staining (pink) and single staining (blue) indicating dead
and viable cells, respectively. The percentages of cell
death (pink cells  100/total cell number) were
calculated for all conditions.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
model
All surgical procedures were performed by sterile/aseptic
techniques in accordance with institutional guidelines.
The male ErbB4+/+ (ErbB4loxP/loxP) and ErbB4/

(PV-Cre; ErbB4loxP/loxP) mice weighing 22 to 30 g were
used for this study. Mice were anesthetized with a
ketamine/xylazine solution (Sigma; 100/20 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally) and subjected to tMCAO. Brieﬂy, head
temperature was monitored using a probe placed under
the left temporal muscle and was maintained at 35.51 °C
to 37.51 °C throughout the tMCAO surgery with water
pads. A skin incision was made in the middle of the
anterior neck. After the left common carotid artery was
tightened using 6-0 silk suture (ETHICON, Somerville,
NJ, USA), a 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament with a siliconecoated tip was inserted into the left internal carotid artery
(ICA) through the external carotid artery (ECA) and then
into the circle of Willis to occlude the origin of the right
middle cerebral artery (MCA). After securing the ﬁlament
in place, the surgical site was closed with 6-0 Vicryl
sutures. Each mouse was then placed in a separate
cage, with a warm water pad under the cage and a
blanket over the cage. After 60 min of ischemia, the nylon
monoﬁlament was withdrawn and the ischemic brain
tissue was reperfused for 24 h before sacriﬁcing. In the
sham animal group, each procedure was performed in
the same way as in the tMCAO animal group, except that
the common, external, and ICAs were not disturbed. To
determine the eﬀects of NRG1 on ischemic stroke, mice
were injected intravascularly (directly into the ECA) with a
single 10 ll dose of vehicle (1% BSA in PBS) or NRG1
(2.5 ng of NRG1/kg body weight dissolved in 1% BSA/
PBS) through a Hamilton syringe at a rate of 5 ll/min as
described previously (Xu et al., 2006). Solutions were
administered at 0 h of reperfusion.

Infarct volume assessment
The mice were killed and the brain tissue was removed
and sliced into 1.0-mm-thick coronal sections after 24 h
of reperfusion. The sections were placed in a 2%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 37 °C and
ﬁxed in 4% formalin for 24 h. TTC, a colorless salt, is
reduced to form an insoluble red formazan product in
the presence of a functioning mitochondrial electron
transport chain. Thus, the infarct region lacks staining
and appears white, whereas the normal non-infarct
tissue appears red. Both sides of each stained coronal
slice were photographed using a digital camera, and
infarction was measured with digital image analysis
software (SigmaScan Pro; Jandel, San Rafael, CA,
USA) and integrated across all six slices. The infarct
volume was estimated indirectly and expressed as a
percentage: total infarct volume of ipsilateral
structure  100/total volume of contralateral structure
(Uchida et al., 2009).

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM). The percentages of cell death among groups were
compared by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA);
p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that approximately 20% of primary
cortical neurons in culture were GABAergic inhibitory
interneurons (Fig. 1), which is consistent with previous
investigations (Halasy and Somogyi, 1993; Aika et al.,
1994; Freund and Buzsáki, 1996).
NRG1 protects against OGD-induced neuronal
apoptosis
Diﬀerent concentrations of NRG1 were added to the
primary neuronal culture media at reoxygenation (0 h).
After 24 h, the percentages of cell death were
determined by Hoechst33342/PI assays (Fig. 2A). As
shown in Fig. 2B, the percentages of cell death in the
NRG1-treated groups (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and
15 nM) were 28.78 ± 1.45%, 23.45 ± 1.62%, 21.06
± 1.78%, 18.96 ± 1.35%, 14.96 ± 1.28%, 17.35
± 1.72% and 17.60 ± 1.73% respectively. The data
showed that NRG1 reduced cell death after OGD in a
dose-dependent manner. Compared with the OGD
group (29.23 ± 1.56%), we found that NRG1 at 5 nM
achieved the maximal protective eﬀect. Therefore, 5 nM
was chosen as the concentration in the following
experiments. NRG1 is also neuroprotective at the 10fold lower dose (0.5 nM), which may be the threshold
dose of this eﬀect.
To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of NRG1’s neuroprotective
eﬀect, we generated ecto-ErbB4, which contains the
entire extracellular region of ErbB4 fused to an FC
fragment (Woo et al., 2007). Ecto-ErbB4 binds to and thus
prevents NRG1 from interacting with ErbB receptor
kinases (Mei and Xiong, 2008). Upon reoxygenation
(0 h) following OGD, cortical neuronal cultures were treated with 2 lg/ml ecto-ErbB4 (Woo et al., 2007) with or
without 5 nM NRG1 intervention, or with 5 nM NRG1
alone. As shown in Fig. 2C, the percentage of cell death
in the NRG1-treated group with ecto-ErbB4 intervention
(27.85 ± 2.27%) was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
ecto-ErbB4 only group (30.88 ± 2.03%), but was greater
than that in the NRG1 only group (13.43 ± 2.20%). The
results demonstrate that ecto-ErbB4 can neutralize the
neuroprotective eﬀect of NRG1 and exclude the eﬀect of
other substances.
NRG1-mediated neuroprotection involves ErbB4 and
GABAergic transmission
Next, AG1478, an ErbB4 inhibitor (Fukazawa et al., 2003)
were used to explore the involvement of ErbB4 in NRG1’s
neuroprotection. Based on previous studies (Woo et al.,
2007), we added 5 lM AG1478 to NRG1-treated cortical
neuronal cultures. As shown in Fig. 3A, AG1478 blocked
the neuroprotective eﬀect of NRG1, and the percentage of
cell death (29.54 ± 1.88%) was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from the AG1478 only group (30.49 ± 1.52%), but was
increased compared with the group treated only with
NRG1 (13.85 ± 2.41%).
Increased GABA neurotransmission exerts neuroprotective eﬀects to reduce cerebral ischemia-induced
neuronal death (Schwartz et al., 1995; Schwartz-Bloom

et al., 1998; Schwartz-Bloom and Sah, 2001; Costa et al.,
2004; Zhou et al., 2008; DeFazio et al., 2009). NRG1 can
promote GABA release via ErbB4 receptors (Woo et al.,
2007). To explore whether the neuroprotective eﬀects
of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling are mediated by a GABAergic
mechanism, we ﬁrst examined the eﬀect of coapplication of NRG1 and GABA receptor agonists in the
setting of OGD. As shown in Fig. 3B, co-application of
the GABAA receptor agonist mus and GABAB receptor
agonist bac had a neuroprotective eﬀect, which is
consistent with the ﬁndings of a previous investigation
(Costa et al., 2004). The co-application of 1 lM mus
and 1 lM bac (Costa et al., 2004) with 5 nM NRG1 markedly diminished neuronal death (13.35 ± 1.67%), but the
eﬀect was similar to that in cells treated with NRG1 alone
(14.55 ± 1.16%) or mus and bac alone (18.50 ± 0.77%).
This result indicates that GABA receptor agonists and
NRG1 do not have synergistic eﬀects, suggesting that
NRG1-mediated neuroprotection involves GABAergic
signaling.
Next, we tested the eﬀect of mild blockade of GABA
receptors on neuroprotection conferred by NRG1. In the
primary neuronal culture suﬀering OGD, weak blockade
of GABAA receptors with 1 lM BMI (Jeon et al., 2011)
and GABAB receptors with 10 lM CGP52432 (CGP)
(Chen and Pan, 2006) did not aﬀect neuronal cell death
(Fig. 3C). The ﬁnding conformed that mild antagonism
of GABA receptors does not exacerbate cell death following OGD (DeFazio et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 3C, the
percentage of cell death in the group treated with 1 lM
BMI, 10 lM CGP and 5 nM NRG1 (21.98 ± 1.55%) was
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent with the GABA receptor antagonists only group (28.56 ± 1.72%), but was higher than
that in the group treated with 5 nM NRG1 alone (14.94
± 1.24%). This suggests that the neuroprotective eﬀects
of NRG1 were partly blocked by GABA receptor antagonists, providing further support for the hypothesis that
NRG1-mediated neuroprotection is via increasing
GABAergic transmission.

NRG1 attenuates ischemic brain injury via ErbB4
Signaling by GABAergic transmission in vivo
ErbB4 expression in the cortex is largely restricted to
GABAergic interneurons (Vullhorst et al., 2009; Fazzari
et al., 2010). In particular, it is expressed by a majority
of PV-positive cells, one speciﬁc class of GABAergic
interneurons (Vullhorst et al., 2009; Fazzari et al.,
2010). Previous studies suggest that NRG1 activates

ErbB4 in PV-positive neurons to facilitate GABAergic
transmission (Chen et al., 2010). Thus, we used the PVErbB4/ mice in which ErbB4 is ablated speciﬁcally in
PV-positive interneurons (Chen et al., 2010) to address
the potential neuroprotective mechanism in a tMCAO
model. Base on the previous report (Xu et al., 2006),
the mice were injected intravascularly with a single 10 ll
dose of vehicle (1% BSA in PBS) or NRG1 (2.5 ng of
NRG1/kg body weight dissolved in 1% BSA/PBS) 0 h
after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 4A, B, tMCAO for
60 min followed by 24-h reperfusion resulted in extensive
infarction of the cerebral cortex and striatum in vehicletreated mice but not in sham mice. The infarct volumes
in the vehicle-treated PV-ErbB4/ group (49.90
± 3.92%) was increased nearly twofold compared with
the vehicle-treated PV-ErbB4+/+ group (28.71
± 2.44%) (Fig. 4A, B), suggesting that the mice with
ErbB4-deﬁciency in PV+ interneurons were more susceptible to tMCAO-induced ischemic brain injury. Treatment
with NRG1 in the PV-ErbB4+/+ group signiﬁcantly
decreased the volume of infarction by 21.11 ± 1.78%
when compared to the vehicle-treated wild-type group
(Fig. 4A, B). Moreover, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant reduction of infarct volume observed in the
NRG1-treated PV-ErbB4/ group (49.90 ± 3.92%)
when compared with the vehicle-treated knockout group
(47.10 ± 3.54%) (Fig. 4A, B). Collectively, these observations provide evidence that the neuroprotective eﬀect
of NRG1 is mediated via activating ErbB4 by increasing
GABAergic transmission in vivo.

DISCUSSION
There are three major ﬁndings from this study. First,
NRG1 reduced OGD-induced apoptosis in cortical
neuronal cell cultures containing GABAergic inhibitory
interneurons. Second, the neuroprotective eﬀect of
NRG1 against OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis may
involve ErbB4 and GABAergic transmission. Third, the
NRG1 neuroprotection against tMCAO-induced ischemic
brain injury was abolished in PV-ErbB4 knockout mice.
Together, the results indicate that NRG1-mediated
neuroprotection
involves
enhanced
GABAergic
transmission via ErbB4 receptors.
Previous studies reported that NRG1 was
neuroprotective in rat models of tMCAO or permanent
MCAO ischemia (pMCAO) (Shyu et al., 2004; Guo
et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007). We found that
NRG1 also rescues cortical neuron cultures containing
GABAergic inhibitory interneurons subjected to OGD,
and we used this in vitro model to clarify the molecular
underpinnings of NRG1 protection.
The juxtamembrane-a (jMa) isoform of ErbB4 can be
cleaved by TACE (tumor necrosis factor-a-converting
enzyme) to release a soluble extracellular peptide that
contains the NRG1 binding site (ecto-ErbB4) (Mei and
Xiong, 2008). Therefore, we conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of
NRG1 neuroprotection by using the neutralization of
exogenous ecto-ErbB4.
ErbB4 is speciﬁcally expressed in GABAergic
interneurons (Lai and Lemke, 1991; Vullhorst et al.,

2009; Fazzari et al., 2010) and is important for proper
CNS function (McBain and Fisahn, 2001). NRG1-ErbB4
signaling has been implicated in both neural development
and synaptic plasticity (Mei and Xiong, 2008; Mei and
Nave, 2014). Ischemic stroke induces ErbB4 upregulation
in neurons (Xu and Ford, 2005). Therefore, we were interested in whether NRG1-mediated neuroprotection is
mediated by ErbB4. Our study demonstrated that the
ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 blocked NRG1 protection against

OGD-induced apoptosis. Although AG1478 is not a speciﬁc inhibitor of ErbB4, our previous studies have shown
that ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to
NRG1 was blocked in neurons pretreated with AG1478
and this treatment also prevented NRG1 from increasing
evoked GABA release and increasing amplitude of
eIPSCs in cortical and hippocampal slices (Woo et al.,
2007; Chen et al., 2010). These observations demonstrate that NRG1 is working via ErbB4. Above all the

neuroprotective eﬀect of NRG1 on brain ischemia was
abolished in PV-ErbB4 knockout mice. Together, a
NRG1-mediated neuroprotective eﬀect would be critically
dependent on ErbB4 signaling.
GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are the only source
of GABA and constitute 10–20% of the neuronal
population across all cortical circuits (Halasy and

Somogyi, 1993; Aika et al., 1994; Freund and Buzsáki,
1996). Although GABAergic cells are a minority of cortical
circuits in terms of neuron numbers, they serve important
functions in CNS. In the past two decades, a number of
laboratories have reported that enhanced GABAergic
transmission is neuroprotective using in vivo and in
vitro models of ischemia (Schwartz et al., 1995;

Schwartz-Bloom et al., 1998; Schwartz-Bloom and Sah,
2001; Costa et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2008; DeFazio
et al., 2009). NRG1 regulates GABAergic transmission
via ErbB4 receptors, which are expressed in GABAergic
presynaptic terminals in the cerebral cortex (Woo et al.,
2007). In this study, GABA receptor agonists mus and
bac did not increase neuroprotection in NRG1-treated
cells following OGD. In addition, mild blockade of GABA
receptors could partly attenuate but not completely abolish the neuroprotective eﬀect of NRG1 against OGDinduced neuronal death. The ﬁndings indicate that
GABAergic transmission contributes to the eﬀect of
NRG1, but there may be some residual neuroprotective
eﬀect even when GABAergic transmission is blocked.
Thus, NRG1-mediated neuroprotection against OGDinduced neuronal death maybe also involve some other
mechanisms.
NRG1 is neuroprotective in rat models of tMCAO
(Shyu et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006).
On the other side, ErbB4 is expressed by most of the
PV-expressing cortical GABAergic interneurons, whereas
only a small fraction of calretinin- and somatostatinexpressing GABAergic interneurons contains this receptor (Vullhorst et al., 2009; Fazzari et al., 2010). In this
study, NRG1 did not develop neuroprotection against
tMCAO-induced ischemic brain injury in the mice with a
speciﬁc ablation of ErbB4 in PV+ GABAergic interneurons. The result supports that the molecular mechanism
of NRG1-mediated neuroprotection against brain ischemia via ErbB4 by enhancing GABA release.

CONCLUSION
We revealed that NRG1 protected against ischemic brain
injury via ErbB4 receptors by enhancing GABAergic
transmission. Our present investigation of the
neuroprotective molecular mechanism of NRG1 is
necessary to determine if this could be a viable
therapeutic strategy for stroke.
