Background: Arjunolic acid (AA), a pentacyclic triterpenoidal saponin of Terminalia arjuna is well
recognized for its antioxidant properties. We proposed to evaluate its antioxidant potential against focal
cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Methods: In the present study, rats were randomly divided into a sham, MCAO, AA (10 and 20 mg/kg)
treated groups. Rats received their respective treatment orally by gavage for 7 days prior to MCAO. Rats
were anaesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg), xylazine (10 mg/kg) and subjected to 2 h occlusion and
22 h reperfusion. Neurological deﬁcit, brain water content and oxidative stress markers were measured
after 22 h of reperfusion.
Results: Rats pretreated with AA showed signiﬁcantly reduced neurological deﬁcit score, infarct size. AA
prevented neuronal damage induced by I/R by regulating the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced
glutathione (GSH), nitric oxide (NO), protein carbonyl content and mitochondria generated reactive
oxygen species. In addition, it also controlled the enzyme activities of Na+–K+ ATPase, superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR).
Conclusions: Pre-treatment with AA effectively prevented the cerebral I/R induced oxidative damage by
virtue of its antioxidant potential. These results indicate that supplementation of AA may be beneﬁcial in
stroke prone population.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Ischemic stroke results from transient or permanent reduction in blood
ﬂow to the brain. The cerebral I/R injury involves a complex
pathological mechanisms such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, apoptosis [2]. Brain’s metabolic demands are high,
consumes 20% of the total oxygen for its survival and is associated
with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3]. During
I/R, rapid decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) alters
membrane activity including mitochondrial membrane, generates
robust ROS overwhelming antioxidants. Oxidative stress plays a
major role in I/R induced neuronal damage [4–6]. Drugs targeting
oxidative stress might be one of the promising avenues for stroke
therapy [7]. Recent studies reported that plant derived compounds

with antioxidant potential scavenge ROS and rescue the neurons
from I/R induced neuronal damage [8–14].
Arjunolic acid (AA: 2,3,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid)
is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoidal saponin derived from
Terminalia arjuna bark, well recognized for its biological functions
like antioxidant [15], anti-fungal [16], hepatoprotective, antibacterial and insecticidal activity [17]. It protects organs against
toxicity and oxidative stress induced by various toxic substances
such as cadmium, arsenic, sodium nitrite, cisplatin [18–24]. The
powerful antioxidant potential of AA provoked our interest to
evaluate its neuroprotective role against I/R injury in a MCAO rat
model. The dose of AA was selected from previous studies [20–22].

in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mM disodium
edentate (EDTA) to yield 5% (w/v) homogenate. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 0 8C in cold centrifuge,
the resulting supernatant was used to determine oxidative product
contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, redox status in I/R brain.

Animals
Determination of protein content
Male rats of Wistar strain weighing 280–300 g were used for the
study. The rats were maintained under conditions of 12 h light/dark
cycle and had free access to food and water. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC),
permission No. 1677/PO/a/12/CPCSEA/4) in accordance with the
guidelines of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision
of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India.
Experimental design
After acclimatization, the rats were randomly divided into four
groups; each group consisted of 12 rats, treated with drug or
vehicle orally by gavage once daily for 7 days prior to MACO. The
ﬁrst group served as sham control and had 2% tween 80 orally. The
second group served as a MCAO group and had 2% tween 80 orally.
The third and fourth groups were treated with AA 10 and 20 mg/
kg/p.o. respectively for 7 days. After 7 days of pre-treatment, rats
were subjected to 2 h right MCAO via the intraluminal ﬁlament
technique [25] and 22 h reperfusion under the anesthesia of
ketamine (100 mg/kg/im) and xylazine (10 mg/kg/im). Brieﬂy, the
right common carotid artery was exposed at the level of the
external and internal carotid artery bifurcation. A 4-0 nylon suture
with a blunted tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery and
advanced into the anterior cerebral artery to block the middle
cerebral artery (MCA). After occluding the MCA for 2 h, nylon
suture was removed carefully to restore blood ﬂow and then the
skin was sutured. The animals were then returned to their cages
and closely monitored for 22 h. The body temperature was
maintained at 37 8C with a thermostatically controlled infrared
lamp. The sham group was surgically prepared for insertion of the
ﬁlament, but the ﬁlament was not inserted. After 22 h of
reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit was evaluated. Then six rats in
each group were decapitated to obtain brain tissue samples for
biochemical analysis, brain tissues from remaining rats were used
for the analysis of brain water content.
Evaluation of neurologic deﬁcits
A neurologic examination is blindly performed at 22 h after
reperfusion according to the method described by Longa et al.
[25]. The neurologic ﬁndings were scored using a 5-point scale. No
neurologic deﬁcit = score 0, failure to extend forepaw fully = score
1, circling to the left = score 2, falling to the left or no spontaneous
motor activity = score 3, and do not walk spontaneously and
experience a lowered stage of consciousness = score 4.
Determination of brain water content (BWC)
After reperfusion for 22 h, rats were decapitated under
anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg),
and the brains were removed. The cerebellum, Pons and olfactory
bulb were separated and their wet weights (WW) were measured
[26]. Dry weights (DW) were assessed after 24 h at 120 8C. BWC
was estimated as [(WW  DW)/WW]  100.
Biochemical analysis: brain tissue preparation
The rats were sacriﬁced by cervical decapitation under
anesthesia and brains were quickly dissected out, homogenized

Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry et al.
[27] using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard protein.
Measurement of sodium potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase) activity
Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured by the method of
Svoboda and Mosinger [28] with slight modiﬁcation. The
Na+/K+-ATPase activity was determined in two reaction media, A
(test mixture) and B (standard mixture). The reaction mixture
A consisted of 0.2 M KCl, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.2 M Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 ml of brain homogenate supernatant in a
total volume of 2.0 ml. The reaction mixture B consisted of 0.1 M
MgCl2, 10 mM ouabain, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.2 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4)
and 0.1 ml of brain homogenate supernatant in a total volume of
2.0 ml. The enzyme reaction was started by adding 0.2 ml of
25.0 mM ATP at 37 8C to both the reaction mixtures A and B. The
reaction was terminated after 15 min by the addition of 1.0 ml
chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The mixture was centrifuged
and the supernatant (0.5 ml) was used for the estimation of
inorganic phosphorous (Pi) according to the method of Fiske and
Subbarow [29].
Measurement of mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species
In cells and tissues, the major key site for the production of
ROS is mitochondria [30]. Hence, the mitochondria of the brain
tissue was isolated to measure the ROS according to the
previously described method of Sims and Anderson [31] with
slight modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, ice-cold isolation buffer (0.25 mol/l
sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mg BSA in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH
7.4) is added to the brain homogenate and subjected to
centrifugation at 4600  g for 10 min and nuclei, cell debris
was discarded. The supernatant was subjected to further
centrifugation at 15,000  g for 15 min. The ﬁnal precipitation
(mitochondria) was set aside in the isolation buffer to a ﬁnal
concentration of 20 mg protein/ml. The mitochondrial supernatant (0.5 mg/ml) from different groups was incubated with
10 mM DCFH-DA, a ﬂuorescent probe at 37 8C for 1 h and the
ﬂuorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of
488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm. ROS level was
expressed as a percentage of ﬂuorescence relative to ischemia/
reperfusion model group.
Measurement of protein carbonyl content
Protein carbonyl content was evaluated according to the
method previously described by Levine et al. [32]. Brieﬂy, the
brain homogenate supernatant was incubated with 1% streptomycin sulfate solution for 15 min and subjected to centrifugation at
3600  g for 10 min. The supernatant was taken and again
incubated with 10 mM DNPH (in 2 mol/l HCl) and vortexed every
10 min for 30 min. An equal volumes of 20% TCA was added to
precipitate the protein and subjected to centrifugation at 8600  g
for 5 min. The residue was washed 3 times with ethanol: ethyl
acetate (1:1) to remove excess DNPH. The precipitated protein was
redissolved in 6 mol/l guanidine solution and its optical density
was measured at 370 nm. Carbonyl content was expressed as
nmol/mg protein.

Estimation of antioxidant markers malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric
oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced
glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione
reductase (GR)
The levels of MDA [33], NO [34], GSH [35] and enzymatic
activities of GR [36], GPx [37], SOD [38] and CAT [39] were
measured in brain by Spectrophotometric methods.
Statistical analysis
Data was expressed as mean  standard error of mean [SEM,
n = 6]. Analyzed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post
hoc test of Dunnett’s test using Graph pad Prism software (Version
5.0). A value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Effect of AA on mitochondria generated ROS
ROS are extensively generated in mitochondria during I/R
injury, which are measured by using a ﬂuorescent probe DCFH-DA.
MCAO group showed signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) increased levels of
ROS as compared with sham group which supports the fact that
there is increased production of ROS from the mitochondria in the
pathogenesis of I/R induced oxidative damage in the brain.
However, MCAO induced increase in mitochondria generated
ROS was prevented by AA pre-treatment as compared with MCAO
group (Fig. 2B).
Effect of AA on protein carbonyl content
I/R induced oxidative brain damage is measured in terms of
protein carbonylation, which may contribute to deprivation of
protein function including structural proteins i.e., cell structures or
functional proteins/special proteins such as hormones, enzymes
and receptors. MCAO group showed signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001)
increased protein carbonyl content as compared with the sham

(p < 0.001) decreased levels of MDA and NO indicating that AA
effectively prevented MCAO induced increase in MDA and NO
levels.
Effect of AA on the antioxidant markers SOD, CAT, GR, GSH and GPx
The activity of SOD, CAT, GR, GPx and the level of GSH were
found to be reduced signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) in the MCAO group as
compared with the sham group. However, these reductions were
partially prevented by pretreatment with AA (Fig. 4A–E).
AA 20 mg/kg showed complete protection in all the measured
biochemical parameters and brain water content as there was no
statistical difference from that of the sham group.

group. Moreover, MCAO induced increase in protein carbonyl
content was signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001) prevented with AA pretreatment (Fig. 2C).
Effect of AA on the contents of MDA and NO
A signiﬁcant increase (p < 0.001) in the contents of MDA and
NO were observed in MCAO group as compared with sham group
(Fig. 3A and B). AA pre-treated groups showed signiﬁcantly

Reduced blood ﬂow results in brain ischemia and subsequent
reperfusion is necessary for the survival of brain. But reperfusion
triggers neuronal damage rather than restoration to normal
physiologic function, as reﬂow to ischemic brain results in
increased oxygen levels, consequently causes severe oxidative
injury to the tissue by substantial production of ROS [40]. However,
reperfusion is fundamental to salvage the compromised ischemic
tissue. Large number of studies reported that oxidative stress plays
a pivotal part in exacerbating the brain injury after reperfusion [4–
6,8]. The robust production of ROS during I/R overwhelms the
antioxidant defence system and distracts the homeostasis. This
distraction results in loss of ion homeostasis, excitotoxicity,
mitochondrial dysfunction, inﬂammation and further neuronal
damage. ROS attack lipids, proteins, DNA and cause subsequent cell
damage [41].
Unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in both
humans and rodents induces contralateral neurological deﬁcits.
Clinical studies have shown an early neurological functional
deﬁcit, as a major predictor of stroke outcome [42]. The behavioral
deﬁcit is proportional to the degree of neuronal dysfunction. A four

point scoring scale is widely used for assessing neurological deﬁcit
in rats subjected to MCAO. Besides, free radicals are known to play
vivacious role in neurobehavioral deﬁcits in experimental models
through oxidative stress. In our study, MCAO group showed
impaired neurobehaviour, as evident from the severe neurologic
score when compared with sham control group which might be
due to free radicals mediated oxidative stress. Earlier studies have
demonstrated that neuroprotection induced by mitigating the
oxidative brain insult after I/R is evidenced by neurobehavioral
function improvement [6,43,44]. In line with the above studies,
improvement in behavioral outcome in terms of neurologic scores
by AA can be attributed, at least in part, by its ability to scavenge
the free radicals through its antioxidant potential.
The lack of oxygen, glucose and nutrients cause loss of ATP
(failure of Na+/K+-ATPase activity) [45], which lead to accumulation of intracellular sodium and water. These alterations facilitate
new protein synthesis, depolarize mitochondrial membrane,
activate caspases and damage plasma membrane phospholipid
symmetry, ultimately cause neuronal damage and cerebral edema
[46]. It has been reported that neuroprotection in brain ischemic
preconditioning is achieved through improving Na+/K+-ATPase
activity [47,48]. The protective effect of AA may be attributed to its
capacity to maintain neuronal membrane integrity through
improving the Na+–K+ ATPase activity.
ROS plays a pivotal part in triggering ischemic brain damage
[49]. Mitochondria are the foremost organelles for the production
of ROS [50]. In the course of oxidative stress, the free electrons leak
out from mitochondrial electron transport chain and react with
molecular oxygen, to generate superoxide anions as metabolic
byproducts during respiration. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with
superoxide anion to produce the highly reactive peroxynitrite
anion (ONOO–) [42,51]. This anion is unstable compound and in
physiological pH degrades to nitrogen peroxide and hydroxyl
radicals, which directly hydroxylate and nitrate the aromatic
residues of amino acids and nucleotides in cytosol and nucleus,
resulting in cellular machinery dysfunction and neuronal loss
[52]. In this study, NO was measured in the form of nitrite levels.
The nitrite levels were increased signiﬁcantly in MCAO group as
compared with the sham group conﬁrms the production of NO
during I/R. Oxidative damage is evaluated in terms of lipid
peroxidation [53]. Lipid peroxidation products are widely accepted
as oxidative stress markers, especially MDA levels are used as a
potentially reliable and sensitive marker of reperfusion injury
[54]. Several studies reported higher MDA levels in stroke patients
[55,56]. The severity of oxidative damage is correlated with MDA
levels. In consistent with this, our results have shown a substantial
elevation in MDA levels in MCAO after ischemia reperfusion and
decreased MDA levels in AA pretreated rats. The anti-lipoperoxidative and anti-nitrosative effect of AA may be attributed to its
protective effect against I/R induced brain trauma.
ROS reacts immediately with the lipids or with molecules such
as proteins, amino acids and sugars, yielding highly reactive
carbonyl derivatives, which involves in irreversible oxidative
damage through deprivation of protein function i.e., protein
carbonylation, measured as protein carbonyl content [57]. The
neuroprotective effects of AA may be mediated through preventing
MCAO induced increase in mitochondria generated ROS and
protein carbonyl content. Endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism (SOD, CAT, GSH, GR, GPx), is important for the maintenance
of homeostasis between free radical generation and defense
mechanism. SOD, ameliorate the function of free radicals by
catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radical to hydrogen
peroxide and prevents the formation of hydroxyl radical. The
dismuted superoxide radical i.e., hydrogen peroxide is further
catalyzed by the catalase enzyme to water and molecular oxygen
[58]. CAT and GPx inactivate hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxides.

GR is involved in the reduction of GSSG to GSH. GSH is one of the
primary endogenous antioxidant enzyme in the brain, which
scavenges hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides [59], thereby
prevent degenerative cellular process. The decline in GSH levels
predisposes the neuronal cells to oxidative stress after ischemia
reperfusion [60,61]. Due to robust production of ROS, there is a
decline in the antioxidant defense system. In consistent with this,
our results showed substantial decrease in antioxidant levels
measured in terms of SOD, CAT, GSH, GR, GPx in MCAO rats. AA
pretreatment signiﬁcantly improved the antioxidant status, thus
maintaining homeostasis between free radicals and antioxidant
defense system, may be one of the possible mechanism of the
neuroprotective effect of AA against I/R injury. Previous studies
observed no adverse effects in rats treated with AA alone at the
dose of 20 mg/kg [18,20,22].
AA is reported to have antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory and antiapoptotic activities. This is the ﬁrst research report on the
neuroprotective activity of AA against cerebral I/R. The present
study emphasizes the preventive efﬁcacy of AA against cerebral I/R
as prevention is better than cure. Our results showed I/R induce
neuronal damage as demonstrated by neurologic deﬁcit, brain
edema along with increased ROS production and impaired
antioxidant defense mechanism. AA pretreatment exhibited
signiﬁcant neuroprotection against I/R injury viz., preventing the
free radicals mediated oxidative stress by enhancing defence
mechanism and thereby rescued the neurons from oxidative
damage through its antioxidant potential. These results indicate
that prophylactic supplementation of AA might reduce the
morbidity in high risk stroke prone population.
