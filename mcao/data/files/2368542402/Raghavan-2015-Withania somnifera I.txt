Abstract Withania somnifera (WS), popularly known as
“Ashwagandha” has been used for centuries as a nerve
tonic. Its protective effect has been elucidated in many
neurodegenerative pathologies, although there is a paucity
of data regarding its effects in ischemic stroke. We examined the neuroprotective properties of an aqueous extract
of WS in both pre- and poststroke treatment regimens in a
mouse model of permanent distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO). WS (200 mg/kg) improved functional recovery and significantly reduced the infarct volume in mice, when compared to those treated with vehicle, in both paradigms. We investigated the protective
mechanism/s induced by WS using brain cortices by testing its ability to modulate the expression of key proteins
in the ischemic-apoptotic cascade. The Western blots and
immunofluorescence analyses of mice cortices revealed
that WS upregulated the expression of hemeoxygenase 1
(HO1) and attenuated the expression of the proapoptotic
protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) via the
PARP1-AIF pathway, thus preventing the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and subsequent
apoptosis. Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) expression was reduced in WS-treated group, whereas Wnt, pGSK3β, and
pCRMP2 expression levels were virtually unaltered. These results indicate the interplay of antioxidant-antiapoptic
pathways and the possible involvement of angiogenesis in
the protective mechanism of WS while emphasizing the
noninvolvement of one of the prime pathways of
neurogenesis. Our results suggest that WS could be a
potential prophylactic as well as a therapeutic agent

properties.

Introduction
The discovery of a therapy for stroke has never been
more imperative, considering that it accounts for one in
every 18 deaths in the USA and is the fourth leading
cause of death [1]. Recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator is the only FDA approved stroke therapy, but
it suffers from an extremely narrow therapeutic window
of 3 h from the onset of stroke symptoms [2]. Moreover, the past two decades have witnessed over 1000
failed clinical trials directed toward stroke therapy, one
of the reasons for which is the limited targeting ability
of the drugs tested—a particular disadvantage in the
complex milieu of brain following ischemic damage
[3]. Naturally, this has shifted the focus to natural
products as sources of potential drugs due to, but not
limited to their multivalent modulation of physiological
targets and relatively low toxicity issues [4]. In this
regard, the constituents of Curcuma longa, Withania
somnifera, Panax ginseng, and Ginkgo biloba have generated a lot of interest and rigorous research [5–8].
W. somnifera (WS), also commonly known as
“Ashwagandha” or Winter cherry is a shrub that has been
used for centuries to treat a host of ailments in the
alternative systems of medicine as an aphrodisiac,
nerve-tonic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent,
and considered to have therapeutic effects in many
cognitive and neurological disorders [9]. The major

1094

biochemical constituents of WS are steroidal alkaloids
and lactones, collectively called withanolides. Although
there is a wealth of information regarding its regenerative effects in several central nervous system disorders,
there is a paucity of data pertaining to its role in stroke.
WS extract is known to inhibit hydrogen peroxide and
amyloid-β-induced cytotoxicity [10, 11], as well as
amyloid-β peptide-induced fibrillogenesis in vitro [12].
Withanolides possess cholinesterase activity, which, in
addition to their calcium antagonistic action, could
prove to be a valuable option in the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease [13]. The neuroprotective effects
of WS also extend to other neurodegenerative disorders
as evidenced by the animal studies in Parkinson’s disease [14, 15], Huntington’s disease [16], and tardive
dyskinesia [17]. Results from these and many other
studies have elucidated the plausible targets of WS
action: It has been reported to modulate cholinergic,
GABAergic, and oxidative systems [9] and also closely
involved in neurite regeneration [18] and antiapoptotic
pathways [19]. The research on the potential of WS in
cerebral ischemia is in its infancy at best, and the
studies so far have not been able to confirm its molecular mode of action in vivo [5, 20, 21]. Hence, we
decided to investigate the role of WS in ischemia using
a mouse model of permanent distal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMCAO).
In this study, we tested an aqueous extract of the root
in both pre- and posttreatment paradigms, to obtain histological, behavioral, as well as molecular evidence for its
actions. We thoroughly evaluated the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of WS and investigated the ones
which would be the most effective in improving stroke
outcomes. Antioxidants have shown tremendous potential
in stroke therapy [22]. To begin with, we chose to test the
effects of WS on the enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 (HO1)—a
well-validated antioxidant target for ischemia [7, 23]. Our
preliminary studies involved testing the effects of WS in
an in vitro model of hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative
stress for cell viability and HO1 modulation, followed by
an in vivo evaluation to confirm the observed effects. We
also sought to assess if WS had antiapoptotic properties,
as prevention of cell death is the ultimate goal of neuroprotection. In this regard, we studied its modulating effects on key apoptotic proteins, apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),
which constitute a relatively novel, yet, crucial pathway
of caspase-independent apoptosis [24]. Finally, we were
also interested if WS could play a role in the repair
processes following ischemia. We tested the modulatory
effect of WS on pathways that aid neurogenesis, principally the Wnt signaling pathway involving glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) [25, 26], as well as those that

retard the process involving semaphorin-3A (Sema3A)
[27].

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line was purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in RPMI 1640
Media (Mediatech, Inc, Manassas, VA) supplemented with
10 % v/v horse serum (Gibco, life technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA), 5 % v/v fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Thermo
scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 100 units/ml of penicillin/
streptomycin, and 1 mM L-glutamine. Cells were cultured in
60-mm plates coated with 50 μg/ml of poly-L-lysine (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated under humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2, 95 % air at 37 °C.
Extract Preparation
An aqueous root extract of W. somnifera was prepared from
Ashwagandha caplets (Himalaya Herbal Healthcare, USA) as
reported elsewhere [10]. Briefly, the caplets were coarsely
powdered, weighed, and infused in freshly boiled deionized
water (1:50 w/v) for 25 min. The infusion was left to cool to
room temperature and centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min). The
supernatant was re-centrifuged (5000 rpm, 15 min) and then
freeze dried. Accurately weighed freeze-dried aliquots of the
extract were reconstituted in physiological saline (0.9 % sodium chloride) /distilled water prior to the dosing regimen.
Cell Viability Assays
PC12 cells were plated at a population of 0.12×106 per well in
24-well plates pre-coated with poly-lysine for 24 h. Cells were
pretreated with different test compounds for 24 h at concentrations of 25, 50,100, and 200 μg/ml. Cell cultures were
challenged with H2O2 (100 μM) for additional 24 h, after
which cell viability assay was performed with the Promega
cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
using the company’s protocol. Optical density was measured
at 570 nm using Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader (BioTek, VT,
USA). All experiments were repeated in triplicate with three
separate batches of culture.
Animals
All animal studies were conducted in accordance to the protocol approved by the University of Toledo Health Science
Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
the guidelines prescribed by the National Institutes of Health.
C57BL/6 mice (5–10 weeks old; 20–25 g) were procured

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1093–1105

from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA and
were housed at 22±1 °C with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with
water and food available ad libitum.
Permanent Distal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
We used our previously optimized method to occlude the
distal portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) [7]. Briefly,
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare,
Deerfield, IL, USA), initially with 3–5 % in the induction
chamber and then maintained at 2 % throughout the surgical
procedure via the nasal cone. With the aid of a surgical
microscope, a 10-mm vertical skin incision was made between
the right eye and ear, and the underlying temporal bone was
exposed by moving the temporal muscle aside. A 2.0-mm burr
hole was drilled and the distal part of MCA was occluded
directly using a bipolar coagulator and complete cessation of
blood flow at the occlusion site was confirmed. Rectal temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe and
maintained at 37.0±0.5 °C during the surgery with a heating
blanket. After the surgery, animals were left to recover in a
temperature-regulated recovery chamber before shifting them
to home cages.
Drug Treatment
In the pretreatment paradigm, WS (200 mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle
(distilled water) was administered daily for 7 days prior to
permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).
In the posttreatment regimen, WS (200 mg/kg, p.o) in distilled
water was administered 4 h immediately after surgery followed by daily doses for 7 days.
Locomotor Activity
Locomotor activity was evaluated by means of a rotarod task.
Mice were placed on a horizontal rod (Columbus instruments,
OH, USA) that was made to rotate at 1 rpm with an acceleration rate of 1 rpm every 10 s, and the time taken for the
animal to fall down was noted. Each animal was tested three
times per trial. All the animals were trained on the rotarod
assembly prior to surgery. The duration for which each animal
was able to stay on the accelerating rod was recorded as the
latency to fall and registered manually. Baseline locomotor
activity was recorded on the day of surgery, and the effect of
drug treatment was tested on the first and seventh day postsurgery.
Infarct Volume Analyses
Animals from all the groups were euthanized 7 days after
pMCAO. Brains were dissected out and sliced into five 2mm-thick coronal sections before incubating in 1 %

1095

triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 20 min at
37 °C. Following overnight fixation in 4 % formaldehyde
solution, brain sections were analyzed for infarct areas using
Image J software provided by NIH. The infarct area was
estimated from five slices of each brain, measuring rostral
and caudal sides of each individual slice in conjunction with
the thickness and calculated as a percentage of the volume of
the contralateral cortex. The final results were expressed as a
percentage of the vehicle-treated group (control) to better
visualize the reduction brought about by the drug-treated
groups.
Western Blots
For the in vitro protein expression studies, PC12 cells
(3.2×106/plate) were treated to WS (100 μg/ml) with or
without H2O2 (100 μM) using the same treatment regimen as the cell viability assays. The cells were dislodged
at the end of the treatment for protein extraction. In case
of the in vivo experiments, cortices of mice were dissected out, weighed, and homogenized prior to extraction. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions were
extracted and protein concentrations were determined by
Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). Samples were analyzed by loading equivalent amounts of
protein (25–40 μg) onto 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
Proteins were transferred from the gel to PVDF membrane
and blocked using 5 % dry nonfat milk and/or 3 % bovine
serum albumin fraction IV (RPI Corp., Mount Prospect,
IL, USA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-PARP-1 dilution 1:1000 (Cell signaling, Danvers, MA, USA); rabbit anti-AIF (Cell signaling) dilution
1:1000; rabbit anti-Sema3A dilution 1:1000 (Abgent, San
Diego, CA, USA); rabbit anti-HO-1 dilution 1:1000 (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); mouse anti-GSK3
α/β dilution 1:1000 (Thermo Scientific); rabbit antiphospho-GSK3 α/β (Ser21/9) dilution 1:1000 (Thermo
Scientific); rabbit anti-Wnt1 dilution 1:1000 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA); rabbit anti-CRMP2 dilution
1:50,000 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA); rabbit antiphospho-CRMP2 (Thr555) dilution 1:1000; rabbit-antihistone H3 dilution 1:3000 (Thermo Scientific); and rabbit anti-GAPDH dilution 1:2000 (Millipore). After washing, membranes were incubated with appropriate dilution
(1:2000–1:5000) of the goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA, USA). Images were analyzed using ChemiDoc
molecular imager (Bio-Rad). The densitometric values
were normalized with respect to the values of histone
H3/GAPDH immunoreactivity to correct for any loading
and transfer differences between samples.

TUNEL Assay and Immunohistochemistry
Mice (vehicle, sham, and WS pretreated; n=3) were allowed
to survive for 7 days following surgery, after which they were
anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (50-65 mg/kg, i.p.),
thoractomized and transcardially perfused with ice-cold
0.9 % NaCl and 4 % buffered paraformaldehyde. The brains
were then dissected out and stored for 24 h in 4 % paraformaldehyde followed by cryosectioning (5–7 μm) for the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemical experiments. The
TUNEL assay was carried out as per the manufacturer’s
protocol (Promega Co.,Madison, WI, USA). The slides were
then incubated with 3 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h
followed by incubation with primary antibody anti-AIF
(1:100; rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. The
slides were washed with 1× PBS for 15 min and incubated
for 2 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG (1:800;
Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by washings in 1×
PBS, after which they were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) to stain nuclei and then
photomicrographed using a fluorescence microscope.
Statistical Analyses
The experimental results are expressed as the mean±SEM and
are accompanied by the number of observations. One-way
ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, was used to
determine significant differences between groups in the infarct
volume and behavioral studies. Student’s unpaired t test was
used to compare (1) control and H2O2 group, (2) H2O2 and
each drug-treated group, (3) sham and vehicle group, and (4)
vehicle and each drug-treated group in the in vitro experiments and immunoblot analyses. A value of p<0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.

Results
WS Protects PC12 Cells from H2O2-Induced Oxidative
Damage Partly by Inducing the Expression of HO1
The H2O2-induced oxidative stress model is one of the most
common in vitro models to study oxidative cell death, which
is a key mechanism of cell death in ischemia. Our results show
that cells treated with H2O2 (100 μM) for 24 h exhibited half
the viability of those that underwent no treatment (Fig. 1a).
WS was able to protect PC12 cells from oxidative death at
higher concentrations, with 100 μg/ml WS raising the viability by almost 40 %. Hence, we decided to use the same
concentration for our protein expression experiment. In order
to attach a mechanism to the observed antioxidant effects of

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1093–1105

WS, we assessed its ability to induce the antioxidant
enzyme-HO1 in PC12 cells treated with H2O2
(100 μM). Cells treated with H2O2 showed a slightly
higher expression of HO1 when compared to untreated
cells, whereas WS increased (nonsignificant) the expression both alone as well as in the presence of H 2 O 2
(Fig. 1b, c), thereby providing a plausible mechanism
for its protective effects.
Pretreatment with WS Improves Functional Outcomes
and Attenuates Infarct Volume in Mice Subjected to pMCAO
We initially sought to test the efficacy of WS in a
pretreatment model of ischemia as WS is a herbal
supplement and would probably be best suited as a
preventive therapy. Mice were given WS (200 mg/kg)
daily for 7 days by oral gavage and subjected to
pMCAO, after which they were allowed to survive for
7 days. Compared to vehicle, WS-treated mice showed
better recovery in their locomotor activity measured
24 h and 7 days after pMCAO. The effect was significant at the 24-h time point (Fig. 2a). There was a
significant reduction in the cortical infarct volume in
WS-treated mice as compared to the vehicle-treated
group (Fig. 2b, c). The absolute values of infarct volume expressed as a percentage of the contralateral cortex were 25.2±2.5 and 35.5±2.5 % for the WS pretreatment and the vehicle groups, respectively.
WS Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Functional
Outcomes in the Posttreatment Regimen in Mice Subjected
to pMCAO
The protective effect of WS in the pretreatment paradigm
encouraged us to test it as a poststroke treatment. We administered WS orally (200 mg/kg) to a separate cohort of mice, 4 h
after pMCAO and then daily for 7 days. We noticed better
recovery of locomotor activity in WS-treated mice as compared to the ones treated with vehicle, the effect being significant at the 24-h time point (Fig. 2a). WS also significantly
lowered cortical infarct volumes in mice when compared to
the vehicle group in the posttreatment regimen (Fig. 2b, c).
The absolute values of infarct volume expressed as a percentage of the contralateral cortex were 23.1.2±3.4 and 35.5±
2.5 % for the WS posttreatment and the vehicle groups,
respectively.
WS-Treated Mice Show an Increased Expression of HO-1
A separate cohort of mice was pretreated with WS
(200 mg/kg; p.o), subjected to pMCAO, and euthanized
following 7 days. The cytoplasmic fractions from the
brain cortices were used for immunoblotting analyses

Fig. 1 WS protects PC12 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage. a
PC12 cells treated with increasing concentrations of WS (25–200 μg/ml)
were exposed to H2O2 (100 μM) and tested for cell viability. Higher
concentrations of WS (100 and 200 μg/ml) were able to significantly
protect cells from oxidative cell death. Data are expressed as percentage
of control cell viability (cells that received no treatment). b WS
(100 μg/ml) in itself was able to induce the expression of antioxidant

enzyme HO1, whereas H2O2-treated cells showed reduced expression.
Cells exposed to both WS and H2O2 showed considerably higher expression of HO1 when compared to just H2O2-treated cells. However, the
effect was not statistically significant when corrected for gel loading
errors. c Each experiment was carried out in triplicate, with three such
experiments using fresh batches of cells. #p<0.05 vs. control; *p<0.05

and compared with those obtained from vehicle- and
sham-treated mice. We probed the blots to determine
HO1 expression levels, as a means to test the antioxidative effects of WS. Vehicle-treated mice showed a
slight increase in the expression when compared to the
sham group (not significant) (Fig. 3a, b). On the other
hand, WS-treated mice showed an expression level almost five times that of the vehicle group (Fig. 3a, b).

WS Prevents the Nuclear Translocation of AIF
Under Ischemic Conditions

WS Abrogates the Expression of PARP1 and Nuclear AIF
Nuclear fractions of the cortical tissue were used to
probe for the levels of PARP1 and AIF expression.
We found that the cortical expression of PARP1 in mice
treated with WS was significantly lower than vehicletreated mice (Fig. 3a, c), suggesting a possible
antiapoptotic mechanism of action. In order to confirm
this hypothesis, we measured the expression of the
apoptotic mediator downstream to PARP1, which is
AIF. We found a similar trend in the expression profile
of AIF in that its expression increased significantly in
ischemic conditions (vehicle-treated mice vs. sham) and
underwent a significant reduction upon WS pretreatment
(Fig. 3a, d).

Another cohort of mice was subjected to the same pretreatment schedule of WS (200 mg/kg; p.o) and brains so obtained
were cryosectioned to study the localization of AIF in the
cortex. Sections were subjected to TUNEL assay in order
border of the to delineate the infarcted region in the cortex
(Fig. 4). The infarcted area was scanned for AIF expression in sham, vehicle-treated, and WS pretreated animals.
We found that the sham group expressed little to no AIF
in their cortices. On the other hand, there was a remarkable increase in its expression in the infarcted region of
vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, AIF was predominantly
localized in the nuclei of the TUNEL positive cells. On the
contrary, in WS-treated mice, AIF was predominantly extranuclear, thus confirming the hypothesis that WS acts by
PARP1-mediated AIF translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 4).
WS Attenuates the Expression of Sema3A—a Negative
Guidance Cue
We sought to test the ability of WS to curtail the inhibitory
environment posed by negative guidance molecules like
Sema3A. Cortices obtained from mice pretreated with

1098

sham, whereas WS significantly abrogated the expression of Sema3A (Fig. 5a, b).
The Wnt Pathway is Not Responsible for the Protective
Effects of WS
In addition to reducing the mitigating factors in neuronal
repair, we wanted to test whether WS could induce repair
mechanisms. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is one
such important mechanism with GSK-3β acting as a primary
effector in the cascade. In order to probe other aspects of Wnt
signaling, we also tested the levels of collapsin response
mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a protein affected by members
of the noncanonical Wnt pathway. We compared the protein
expression levels of Wnt, GSK-3β, and CRMP2 across the
different treatment groups. We found that although Wnt expression increased upon ischemic insult, there was virtually no
difference between the vehicle- and the WS-treated groups
(Fig. 5a, c). Since the phosphorylation status of the effectors/
mediators of this pathway is crucial to understanding their
effects, we tested both the phosphorylated and the total levels
of GSK-3β and CRMP2. We compared the ratios of pGSK3-β (Ser21/9)/total GSK-3β levels and found that WS
lowered the levels of phospho- (Ser21/9) when compared to
vehicle, although the effect was not statistically significant
(Fig. 5d, e). Similarly, the pCRMP2 (Thr555)/total CRMP2
ratios were not significantly different among either treatment
groups (Fig. 5d, f).

Discussion

in a mouse model of pMCAO. a Pre- and posttreatment of WS
(200 mg/kg, p.o.) improved the locomotor activity of mice both 1 and
7 days following ischemia. This effect was significant only at the 24-h
time point in both the regimens. b Representative brain pictures showing
WS’s protection in pre- and posttreatment paradigms. c Both pre- and

The results of the present study show that WS has neuroprotective potential in both pre- and poststroke treatment paradigms in a mouse model of focal ischemia. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the viability of
WS as a postischemic treatment. In addition to the infarct
volumes, WS also showed a definite trend in improving the
locomotor activities of mice subjected to ischemia, which is an
important finding vis-a-vis the functional recovery following
stroke. We believe that the constituents in the WS extract exert
part of their neuroprotective effects by preventing apoptotic
neuronal cell death, specifically by inhibiting the PARP1-AIF
apoptotic cascade. The extract also exhibits antioxidative effects and plausibly aids neuronal repair, as evidenced by its
modulation of HO1 and Sema3A.
We chose to study the effects of WS extract in a permanent
model of focal ischemia due to its high reproducibility in
producing a selective infarct in the cortex without damaging
deeper structures and also its low mortality rate [28]. We chose
the dose of WS based on literature studying its effects in other
neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s and

Fig. 3 WS has antioxidative and
antiapoptotic properties: a

expression as compared to the

showed a reduced expression of
PARP1 and AIF as compared to

involvement of apoptotic cell
death in the ischemia induced by

Huntington’s disease [9, 16]. Appropriate dose adjustments according to the surface area were made when converting rat doses
to mice [29]. We performed a pilot study wherein a WS dose of
100 mg/kg did not significantly reduced the infarct volume when
compared to the vehicle-treated group (unpublished results). The
significant reduction in the prime histological parameter of experimental stroke—the infarct volume—in both the pre- and
posttreatment experiments suggests that WS is a viable candidate
for stroke therapy. After infarct volume, functional recovery is
the next important parameter for evaluation of experimental
stroke therapy, though there is not always a correlation between
histological and functional outcomes. Both WS pre- and posttreatment showed a significant recovery in locomotor activity at
the 24-h time point and a favorable trend at 7-days post-surgery.
The reason for the lack of statistical significance at later timepoints post-surgery could be the inherently low statistical power
of neurobehavioral studies [30]. We believe that an increase in
the sample size would provide a more reliable indicator in

the future. The other reason could be that dose of WS used in
this study is effective for improving short-term functional outcome and a higher dose might be necessary to extend the effect.
There has been speculation regarding the mechanism of
action of WS in ischemic stroke [9], but studies so far
have not postulated its cellular target. Hence, we wanted
to determine WS-mediated molecular consequences that
could explain its ameliorative effects in our experimental
model. First, we conducted a comprehensive literature
review of the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of
WS in other central nervous system disorders to gain a
general understanding of its potential targets in ischemia.
We found substantial evidence for its antioxidant effects
over a range of disease conditions, the pathological mechanisms of which are similar to those involved in ischemia
[14, 16, 31]. Therefore, we designed our initial experiments to test the extract in a cell-based model of oxidative
stress. Oxidative stress is centrally implicated in the

Fig. 4 WS acts via the PARP1-AIF pathway by preventing the translocation of AIF to the nucleus under ischemic conditions. The TUNEL
assay was used to delineate the ischemic region (green) to study apoptotic
death (×10). The border of the white boxes denote the area chosen to study
the AIF translocation. Sham brains show little or no TUNEL and AIF
expression (n=3). The ischemic area was studied [vehicle and WS
(pretreatment); 100×; n=3 each] to verify the localization of AIF. The

immunohistochemical results corroborated the results obtained from IB.
AIF was predominantly nuclear in the cortices of vehicle-treated mice. On
the other hand, WS-treated (pretreatment) mice showed mainly extranuclear localization, confirming our hypothesis that it prevents the translocation of AIF to the nucleus under ischemic conditions. (blue DAPI,

pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, and the H2O2 model
used in this study is a reliable marker of oxidative stress
[32]. We demonstrated that WS protects PC12 cells from
oxidative damage at higher test concentrations
(100 μg/ml). We were curious to see if these effects were
due to WS’s ability to bolster antioxidant responses. We
used the expression levels of the enzyme HO1 as an
indicator of WS’s antioxidant efficacy. HO1 is responsible
for the catabolism of prooxidant heme to form bioactive products: iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin/bilirubin. It is the
inducible isoform of this enzyme, and is the one most sensitive
to modulation by various pathological conditions [33]. The
salutary effects of HO1 stem not only from the degradation of
heme, thereby attenuating its oxidative damage, but also from
the protective effects of its reaction products. HO1 is the prime
source of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), which at physiological concentrations is known to promote endothelial cell
survival partly by mimicking the vasodilatory and proangiogenic effects of nitric oxide (NO) [33, 34]. Additionally,
CO is also known to have antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory
effects [35, 36]. Moreover, the antioxidative effect of HO1 is
supplemented also by the free-radical scavenging properties of
biliverdin and its reduced form, bilirubin [33]. Thus, the conglomerate antioxidant, angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and
antiapoptotic effects make HO1 a valuable cytoprotective enzyme. The ability of WS to substantially increase the expression
levels of HO1 both in our in vitro model of oxidative stress and

in our animal model lends a credible mechanistic reason for the
improved physiological and functional outcomes observed in
the study.
Next, we sought to confirm whether these postulated protective mechanisms triggered by WS indeed translated into
neuroprotection, i.e., prevented the abundant cell death
resulting from ischemia. Cell demise following focal cerebral
ischemia is mainly necrotic and occurs in the ischemic core
due to lack of perfusion. However, the core is surrounded by a
hypo-perfused edge of tissue called the ischemic penumbra,
wherein death is primarily due to apoptosis. This region is
potentially salvageable and presents the most effective window for therapeutic intervention in stroke [37]. This got us
interested in evaluating the capacity of WS to modulate apoptotic pathways.
Apoptosis following cerebral ischemia can undergo via
two pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic
pathway is initiated by ligands binding to cell surface “death
receptors,” causing the eventual activation of caspases, whereas the intrinsic pathway is characterized by internal stimuli
causing mitochondrial damage and release of cytochrome-c
followed by caspase activation [38]. Within the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, there is growing evidence for the existence
and significant contribution of caspase-independent pathways
[39–42]. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a flavoprotein localized in the mitochondria, is a key mediator of the caspaseindependent apoptotic pathway, and plays a crucial role in

focal ischemic damage [37]. It has recently been discovered that
under conditions of cellular duress, which is one of the hallmarks of ischemic damage, AIF released from the mitochondria
translocates to the nucleus, where it induces large-scale DNA
fragmentation and neuronal cell death [43]. This translocation
process is resistant to the pharmacological inhibition of
caspases or gene knockouts of caspase-9, further clarifying its
caspase-independent role [44].
Many factors including cathepsins, calpains, and PARP1
trigger the release of AIF from the mitochondria and its

subsequent translocation to the nucleus [45]. While calpains
cause AIF release in the hippocampus after global ischemia
[46], there is a body of evidence to implicate PARP1 in the
AIF-mediated apoptosis in focal ischemia [24, 47, 48]. PARP1
is a nuclear enzyme that is sensitive to DNA damage and
mediates apoptotic cell death in neuronal cells [49]. The
activities of AIF and PARP1 are interdependent in the cellular
death cascade following ischemia. The PARP1-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) consumption and
energy depletion has been shown to parallel AIF translocation

1102

and nuclear condensation, thus linking PARP1 activation,
NAD+ levels, and AIF translocation. The decreased NAD+
levels following PARP1 activation is sensed by the mitochondria, which causes release of AIF and its subsequent transport
to the nucleus, where it initiates nuclear condensation that
inevitably leads to cell death [48].
Our results confirm that WS attenuates the levels of PARP1
and prevents the translocation of AIF to the nucleus following
ischemic injury, thereby inhibiting one of the principal pathways of caspase-independent apoptosis. Thus, we concluded
that the protective effects initiated by WS constituents culminate in the reduction of apoptotic cell death. WS-mediated
HO1 upregulation might have both contributed as well as
resulted from the increased cell survival.
Having confirmed the neuroprotective effects of WS, we
proceeded to test its ability to aid the repair process following
ischemia. Drugs targeting stroke recovery provide the advantage of a wider therapeutic window as well as a means to
reduce the debilitating effects of stroke [50]. Recovery from
stroke involves the collaborative functioning of three processes within the neurovascular niche: neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and neuroplasticity [51]. However, there is evidence to
suggest that these processes are impeded by the presence of an
inhibitory microenvironment comprised of negative or
chemorepulsive guidance cues that prevent axonal sprouting
[52–54]. Thus, drugs attenuating the inhibitory effects of these
cues could be candidates for neuronal repair.
Semaphorins form an important class of such negative
guidance cues including ephrins, myelin-associated proteins
like NogoA, and extracellular matrix proteins like chondroitin
sulphate proteoglycans [50]. Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) is an
important member of this family, and is known to inhibit
axonal growth and induce growth cone collapse [55, 56].
Sema3A levels are elevated after stroke and could be involved
in the inhibitory mechanisms leading to brain damage [53,
57]. In addition to these effects, it is also thought to prevent
revascularization, particularly vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis [27, 58].
Our results show an elevated expression of Sema3A in
the cortices of vehicle-treated mice, consistent with other
studies [53, 57]. The WS-mediated significantly lower
expression of Sema3A points toward a relatively less
inhibitory environment to the recovery process, and possibly an indirect pro-angiogenic role. Our deductions on
the effects of Sema3A are opposite of that in Nada et al.
[59], although a similar pattern of its expression in the
ischemic group was observed. It was argued that a surge
in cyclic nucleotide concentration might have caused a
shift from repulsive nature of Sema3A to attraction. However, it is known that a combination of various factors
influence the global levels of cyclic nucleotides, not just
the microenvironment in question [60]. Our conclusion
that the reduced levels of Sema3A are beneficial for repair

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1093–1105

is fortified by two facts: HO1 is known to induce VEGF,
and that Sema3A is a competitive antagonist of VEGF
and attenuates its pro-angiogenic effect [61]. Since angiogenesis has been consistently shown to be essential for
neurogenesis [51], our next logical step was to test for
markers of neurogenesis in the drug-treated brains.
Neurogenesis following stroke is a complex process involving proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, migration
of neuroblasts to the injured site, and the eventual differentiation and functional integration of the mature neurons [62].
Given that a very few neuroblasts undergo differentiation, any
agent that could induce either step in the neurogenic process
may hasten stroke recovery [63]. Wnt signaling [64] is one of
the several pathways involved in the regulation of neural
progenitor proliferation along with the sonic hedgehog (Shh)
[65], fibroblast growth factor (FGF) [66], and the notch signaling pathways [67]. Wnts are secreted proteins pivotal to the
development of the central nervous system; their roles as
diverse as specifying cell polarity, neuronal migration, axon
guidance, and synaptogenesis to name a few [68]. Wnts are
highly conserved and activate many signaling cascades upon
binding their receptors which could range from the transmembrane frizzled receptors (Fzd), to tyrosine kinases, and, recently, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) [68]. They function via
two distinct pathways broadly classified as the Wnt/β-catenin
or the canonical pathway and the β-catenin independent or
noncanonical pathway [69]. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin
pathway is the one most studied in terms of both cortical
and hippocampal neurogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation, and synaptic plasticity [64, 70, 71]. Moreover, its induction has been shown to improve neurogenesis after focal
cerebral ischemia [63, 72]. Concisely put, the pathway involves transcription of Wnt target genes via the stabilization
of β-catenin so that it could translocate to the nucleus to
commence transcription. In the absence of Wnt, the kinases
casein kinase-1α (CK-1α) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β
(GSK-3β) sequentially phosphorylate and signal β-catenin
for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The downstream events of Wnt signaling phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3β, thereby preventing this β-catenin
degradation [69]. GSK-3β plays a vital role in the execution
of this pathway as well as in many other pathways affecting
neural development [26, 73]. Therefore, we looked at both
Wnt and GSK-3β expression levels to decipher if WS could
influence this pathway. However, we failed to see a marked
effect in Wnt expression levels in animals treated with WS.
Similarly, no significant changes were seen in the phosphorylated form of GSK-3β (Ser21/9), thereby making this pathway unlikely to be responsible for the protective effects of
WS.
In order to rule out the influence of this pathway, we
decided to also assess the downstream events of the noncanonical Wnt pathway. This pathway functions either by

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1093–1105

activating C-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to maintain
tissue polarity or by triggering the intracellular calcium
release and concomitant activation of calcium-dependent
kinases like Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
(CaMKII), calcineurin, and protein kinase-C (PKC) [69].
This pathway is known to play a role primarily in cell
movement, tissue separation, cardiogenesis, and
myogenesis among many others [74]. There is increasing
evidence to suggest that this pathway might antagonize
the canonical pathway by competition for the Fzd coreceptor [74, 75]. That the pathway activates JNK and
CaMKII kinases and that both of them have been implicated in mediating some of the deleterious effects of
ischemia [76, 77] lends further credence to the noncanonical pathway functioning opposite to the protective canonical pathway. Collapsin response mediator protein 2
(CRMP2) is a target in both the JNK kinase as well as
the calcium-dependent pathways. Its phosphorylation at
Thr555 by the kinases functioning in both these mechanisms [78] [79] [80] inhibits axonal growth. In our study,
we failed to observe a significant alteration in the phosphorylation levels of CRMP2 in both the vehicle and the WStreated groups. Since CRMP2 is a downstream target of key
proteins involved in the noncanonical Wnt pathway, it is
reasonable to conclude that the WS does not induce the
supposed harmful effects of the noncanonical signaling mechanism in our context. In short, WS does not considerably
perturb either the canonical or the noncanonical pathway to
mediate its observed protective effects.

Conclusion and Future Directions
Our results demonstrate the neuroprotective and the potential
neuroreparatory properties of WS in an animal model of
ischemic stroke. We were also able to elucidate part of its
cellular mechanism of action. Having ruled out the Wnt
signaling pathway of neurogenesis, it would be worthwhile
to see if other neurogenesis mechanisms might have played a
role. Also, the interplay between the antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and the repair promoting mechanisms of WS would
make for an interesting study and might provide a better
understanding of the intermeshing mechanisms involved in
stroke damage. Of particular interest in this regard is the
interplay between the HO-1 and Sema3A pathways, considering that HO1 is known to induce VEGF, which has opposing
effects to that of Sema3A, acting via a common receptor [61].
We believe that there is considerable scope to explore the
beneficial effects of WS in ischemic injury. Some of our future
endeavors in this direction include testing individual components of the extract and studying other cellular pathways
modulated by this fascinating herb.
