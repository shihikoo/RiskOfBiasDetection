Introduction

Stroke is the third leading cause of morbidity worldwide and
remains a major challenge to public health. Because of the
limitation of effective therapeutics, it is also a leading cause of
serious, long-term disability (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Cellbased treatments of stroke include neural stem cells, bone
marrow stromal cells, and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
cells (UCMSCs) (Zacharek et al., 2010). UCMSCs have potent
therapeutic potential for stroke and umbilical cord blood, and
implantation of the human UCMSCs (hUCMSCs) into the
damaged hemisphere of ischemic stroke rats induce angiogenesis, and promote functional recovery after stroke (Chen et al.,
2001; Koh et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2011). hUCMSCs treatment of
stroke increases angiogenesis and vascular stabilization, partially mediated by Angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie system (Lin et al.,
2011). Ang1 belongs to a family of endothelial growth factors
and promotes migration, sprouting, and survival of endothelial
cells and thereby mediates vascular remodeling through activation of signaling pathways triggered by Tie2 (Suri et al., 1996).
Ang1 plays a role in the recruitment of vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs) and pericytes during vascular maturation and the
remodeling processes (Sato et al., 1995; Suri et al., 1996).
Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), as an antagonist for Ang1, inhibits
Ang1-promoted Tie2 signaling and decreases blood vessel
maturation and stabilization (Cui et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2011a).
A major question involved in the use of stem cells for the
treatment of stroke is stem cells within normal tissues might
be of cancerous origin (Sell, 2010; Stagg, 2008). Therefore, to
ensure the safety and efﬁciency of cell-based therapies,
developing an alternative approach to direct transplantation
of stem cells is necessary.
Previous studies have reported many growth factors and
cytokines derived from the conditioned medium (CM) of
various stem cells (Barcelos et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009; Di
Santo et al., 2009; Kinnaird et al., 2004; Perin and Silva, 2009;
Yoon et al., 2010), which could be responsible for the paracrine
protective effects of stem cells against several diseases. Consequently, the use of stem cells CM instead of direct implantation of stem cells may be a feasible approach to overcome the
limitations of current cell-based therapy. In addition, administration of CM resolves the ethics issues involved with cell
therapies, because CM is not a cell, but a conjugate of many
growth factors such as TGF-β and VEGF (Cho et al., 2012; Inoue
et al., 2013).
Despite the important neuroprotective roles of stem cells
CM, delivery of it to brain is a signiﬁcant challenge because of
the presence of the blood–brain and the blood–cerebrospinal
ﬂuid barriers (Thorne and Frey, 2001). The methods for
injecting CM directly into brain tissue in clinical practice are
invasive, such as intracerebroventricular, intraparenchymal

and intrathecal administration, which are limited to clinical
application popularly (Thorne and Frey, 2001). Recently, a
new noninvasive intranasal application (INA) drugs into CNS,
bypassing the blood brain barrier was reported (Zhu et al.,
2012). Previous studies have shown that CM can be treated by
intranasal routine (Di Santo et al., 2009). However, whether
CM administered by this route in ischemic stroke has neuroprotective effects remained unclear.
In the present study, we investigated whether INA of
hUCMSCs-CM improves neurological functional outcome
and vascular remodeling in a rat model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo). Molecular mechanisms underlying
vascular remodeling induced by hUCMSCs-CM are described.

Results

2.1.

hVEGF in hUCMSCs-CM

To tests whether VEGF was expressed in hUCMSCs-CM, Elisa
tests have been performed. Fig. 1 shows that hUCMSCs-CM
contained signiﬁcantly higher amounts of hVEGF than
DMEM/F12 medium.

2.2.

Neurological outcome and lesion volume

To test whether intranasal administration of hUCMSCs-CM
regulates functional outcome and lesion volume after stroke, a
battery of functional tests was performed. Fig. 2 shows that
hUCMSCs-CM group exhibited signiﬁcantly improved functional recovery (A and B, po0.05), but not reduced lesion
volume (C, p40.05) when compared with DMEM/F12 medium
control group and saline control group. No signiﬁcant differences of functional recovery and lesion volume were detected

BBB leakage and BBB integrity

3.
To investigate whether intranasal administration of
hUCMSCs-CM regulates BBB leakage after stroke, quantitative
analysis of Evans blue dye extravasation was performed.
Fig. 3A shows that signiﬁcantly decreased BBB leakage was
detected in hUCMSCs-CM group compared to DMEM/F12
medium control group and saline control group (po0.05), no
signiﬁcant difference of BBB leakage was observed between
DMEM/F12 medium control group and saline control group
(p40.05). To test BBB functional integrity, ZO1, Occludin, and
Desmin were measured in the ischemic brain. Fig. 3B–D shows
that hUCMSCs-CM group exhibited signiﬁcantly increased BBB
functional integrity compared to DMEM/F12 medium control
group and saline control group (po0.05). There is no signiﬁcant
difference of BBB functional integrity between DMEM/F12
medium control group and saline control group (p40.05).

2.4.

Vascular changes in the ischemic brain

To test whether intranasal administration of hUCMSCs-CM
affects vascular change, vWF immunostaining was performed.
Fig. 4 shows that the vascular perimeter was signiﬁcantly
increased in hUCMSCs-CM group compared to DMEM/F12
medium control group and saline control group (po0.05).
However, there are no signiﬁcant differences of vascular perimeter between DMEM/F12 medium control group and saline
control group (p40.05).

2.5.

Ang/Tie2 system expression

To investigate whether intranasal administration of hUCMSCsCM affects vascular remodeling, Ang1, Ang2, and Tie2 expression was evaluated by western blotting. Fig. 5 shows that rats
treated with hUCMSCs-CM exhibited increased Ang1 and Tie2
expression, but decreased Ang2 expression in the ischemic
brain when compared to rats in DMEM/F12 medium control
group and saline control group (po0.05). No signiﬁcant differences of the above protein expression were observed between

Discussion

Our data demonstrated that hUCMSCs-CM treatment of stroke
by intranasal routine starting 24 h after MCAo in rats signiﬁcantly reduces BBB leakage and promotes functional outcome
but does not decrease lesion volume compared to rats in
DMEM/F12 medium control group and saline control group.
Treatment of ischemic rats with hUCMSCs-CM signiﬁcantly
decreases the levels of Ang2 and increases the levels of both
Ang1 and Tie2 in the ischemic brain. To take together,
increased expression of Ang1 and Tie2 and decreased expression of Ang2, induced by hUCMSCs-CM treatment, may be
contributed to vascular remodeling in the ischemic brain which
plays an important role in functional outcome after stroke.
Stroke occurs as a result of loss of blood supply or inadequate blood ﬂow to a particular part of the brain especially in
middle cerebral artery region (Ishrat et al., 2009). Hypoxia and
diminished energy supply after ischemic stroke results in BBB
rupture. The BBB function consists of a combination of the
capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and numerous
astrocytic foot processes (Hori et al., 2004). Recent studies
indicated that tight junctions (TJs) and adherent junction are
important structural and functional basis of maintaining the
BBB integrity in vivo. TJs are complex network consisting of
complicated proteins including transmembrane proteins of
occludin, claudins, peripheral membrane protein family of
zonula occludins (ZOs), adhesion molecules, etc. (Yu et al.,
2012). The expression levels of these proteins help regulate
barrier permeability (Zhang et al., 2002). Desmin is one of
pericyte markers and can exert a vital role in maintaining the
BBB integrity, it was also noted that astrocytes and pericytes
interact with the endothelial cells in maintaining the vessel's
barrier features and junctional tightness (Zhang et al., 2002). In
the present study, we found that hUCMSCs-CM group exhibited
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of ZO1, Occludin, and
Desmin compared to DMEM/F12 medium control group and
saline control group (po0.05). Therefore, treatment of ischemic
rats with hUCMSCs-CM may improve BBB functional integrity.

Fig. 3 – Intranasal administration of hUCMSCs-CM decreases BBB leakage and vascular damage. A: Intranasal administration
of hUCMSCs-CM signiﬁcantly decreases BBB leakage after stroke in rats when compared with rats in DMEM/F12 medium
control group and saline control group (*po0.05, n¼ 5/group). B–D: ZO1, Desmin, Occludin expressions were signiﬁcantly
increased in hUCMSCs-CM group compared to DMEM/F12 medium control group and saline control group (*po0.05, n¼ 10/
group).

Angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2) are ligands for the
endothelial-speciﬁc receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie2. The Ang/
Tie2 system plays a vital role in the pathophysiological
mechanisms of stroke, exerts protective effects on the progression of stroke and may regulate vascular remodeling and
BBB permeability after stroke (Ye et al., 2011a). Ang1 promotes vascular remodeling and protects the adult vasculature from vascular leakage, Ang2 serves as a natural inhibitor
of Ang1 activity (Zhang et al., 2002). Inhibition of vascular
leakage and outstanding increase in vascular branches were
observed when Ang1 was overexpressed (Suri et al., 1998;
Thurston et al., 2000). In this study, we found that treatment

of ischemic rats with hUCMSCs-CM exhibited signiﬁcant
increased expression of Ang1 and Tie2, and decreased Ang2
expression (po0.05). Therefore, treatment of ischemic rats
with hUCMSCs-CM may enhance vascular remodeling.
In conclusion, intranasal administration of hUCMSCs-CM
increases BBB functional integrity, promotes vascular remodeling, and improves functional outcome after stroke. Regulation of Ang/Tie2 system by hUCMSCs-CM treatment may
contribute to the beneﬁcial effect after stroke. As hUCMSCsCM can be stocked, it may be used in the acute stages of
stroke. To take together, it is a potential candidate for the
innovative treatment and further investigations into the use

Experimental procedures

All experiments were conducted in accordance with the
standards and procedures of the American Council on Animal Care and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Xuzhou Medical College.

4.1.

Primary culture of HUCMSCs

Fresh human umbilical cords were obtained from healthy
women ranging from 25 to 30 years old (n ¼6) who delivered
healthy full-term infants by cesarean section at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Afﬁliated Hospital
of Xuzhou Medical College (03/05/2012 to 04/05/2012). These
women were healthy with no history of infectious diseases or
pregnancy complications, and were conﬁrmed to be negative
for HBV, HIV, and syphilis. Informed consent was obtained,
and all procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of
our hospital.
hUCMSCs culture was performed, as previously described
(Zhu et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, the umbilical cords were minced
into 1 cm3 fragments, and subsequently homogenized into 1–
2 mm3 pieces. Tissue cultures were maintained in DMEM/F12

medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone),
and were incubated in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2
at 37 1C. After primary culture, the cells were subcultured at
1  104 cells/cm2 and used in the experiments after three to
ﬁve passages.

4.2.

Preparation of hUCMSCs-CM

hUCMSCs from three to ﬁve passages were cultured in T75
culture ﬂask. The cells were cultured with 10 ml serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium after reaching a conﬂuence of 80%.
Conditioned medium of HUCMSCs was collected after 24 h
of culture and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were re-centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min followed
by collection of the second supernatants, named HUCMSCsCM (Cho et al., 2012; Inoue et al., 2013).

4.3.

MCAo model and experiment groups

Adult male rats were anesthetized and transient (2 h) MCAo
was induced by using an intraluminal vascular occlusion (Ye
et al., 2011a). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 1C
throughout the surgical procedure using a feedback regulated
water heating system. A nylon suture with its tip rounded by
heating near a ﬂame was inserted into the external carotid
artery (ECA) through a small puncture. The length of nylon

494

brain research 1624 (2015) 489–496

suture, determined according to the animal's weight, was
gently advanced from the ECA into the lumen of the internal
carotid artery (ICA) until the suture blocked the origin of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA). The nylon ﬁlament was
retained inside the ICA for 2 h and the neck incision was
closed. The animals were moved to their cage to awaken.
After 2 h of MCAo, restoration of blood ﬂow was performed by
withdrawal of the ﬁlament until the tip cleared the lumen of
the ECA. The incision was then closed. Rats were randomized
and assigned to different groups and were treated by intranasal routine starting 24 h after MCAo with: (1) saline for
control group (n¼18); (2) DMEM/F12 medium (1 ml/kg/d) for
medium control group (n¼ 18); (3) hUCMSCs-CM (1 ml/kg/d)
treatment group daily for 14 days (n ¼18). When treated daily,
these rats were not anesthetized. Rats were sacriﬁced at 14
days after MCAo.

4.4.

ELISA tests for hVEGF in hUCMSCs-CM

hUCMSCs-CM was subjected to ELISA using Quantikine kits
for hVEGF (Westang, Shanghai, China).

4.5.

Intranasal administration of hUCMSCs-CM

The procedure of intranasal administration is as follows with
slight modiﬁcations in different research protocols (Inoue
et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, anesthetized animals
are placed in a supine position, and the ventral surface of the
head and neck is maintained horizontal using a small role of
gauze under the dorsal neck. The preparations were administered in aliquots of 10 μL at a time and alternated nostril,
with an interval of 2 min between each administration.
During these procedures, the mouth and opposite nostril
were closed.

4.6.

Neurological functional tests

Footfault, adhesive removal test and a modiﬁed neurological
severity score (mNSS) evaluation were performed before
MCAo, and at 1 day after MCAo before treatment and 7, 14
days after MCAo by an investigator who was blinded to the
experimental groups (Chen et al., 2011).
mNSS is a composite of motor, sensory, balance and reﬂex
tests. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0–18
(normal score 0; maximal deﬁcit score 18) with one point
awarded for the exhibition of speciﬁc abnormal behavior or
for lack of a tested reﬂex. A greater impairment of normal
function results in a higher score. Rats were excluded if mNSS
score less than 6 or over 13 24 h after MCAo.

4.7.
Quantitative evaluation of Evans blue dye
extravasation
Rats (n¼ 5/ group) were sacriﬁced at 5 days after MCAo. 2%
Evans blue dye in saline was injected intravenously as a BBB
permeability tracer at 2 h before sacriﬁce. Evans blue dye
ﬂuorescence intensity was determined by a microplate ﬂuorescence reader (excitation 620 nm and emission 680 nm).
Calculations were based on the external standards dissolved

in the same solvent. The amount of extravasated Evans blue
dye was quantiﬁed as micrograms per ischemic hemisphere.

4.8.
Lesion volume, histological and immunohistochemical
assessment
The brains were ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline,
followed by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde before being embedded in parafﬁn. Seven coronal
sections of tissue were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for calculation of volume of cerebral infarction
and presented as a percentage of the lesion compared with
the contralateral hemisphere (Ye et al., 2011b).
A series of 6 μm thick sections was cut from the standard
parafﬁn block (bregma –1–þ1 mm). Every 10th coronal section
for a total 5 sections was used for immunohistochemical
staining. Antibody against Von Willebrand Factor (vWF, a
endothelial cell marker, 1:50; Bioss, Beijing), zona occludens-1
(ZO-1, a tight junction protein, 1:30; Boster, Wuhan); Occludin
(a tight junction protein, 1:50; Boster, Wuhan); Desmin (a
pericyte marker, 1:50; Boster, Wuhan) (Nourhaghighi et al.,
2003; Sandhu et al., 2004). Control experiments consisted of
staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined above, but
non-immune serum was substituted for the primary antibody
(Li et al., 1998). The immunostaining analysis was performed
by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups.

4.9.

ZO1 and Desmin expression quantiﬁcation

Five slides from each brain, with each slide containing 8 ﬁelds
from the ischemic border zone (IBZ) were digitized under a
20  objective using a 3-CCD color video camera interfaced
with an MCID image analysis system(Calza et al., 2001; Chen
et al., 2003). ZO1, Occuludin and Desmin immunoreactive
cells were counted in 20 enlarged vessels. The data are
presented as percentage of positive cell number or positive
area of immunoreactive cells, respectively.

4.10.

Vascular perimeter measurement

Eight ﬁelds of view of vWF immunostaining from the IBZ
were digitized using a 20X objective via the MCID computer
imaging analysis system. The total perimeter of 10 enlarged
thin walled vessels in the IBZ was measured (Chen et al.,
2003).

4.11.

Western blot

Ischemic brain tissues (n¼3/group) were extracted from the
ipsilateral hemisphere. Equal amounts of cell lysate were
subjected to Western blot analysis, as previously described
(Cui et al., 2013a, 2013b). The following primary antibodies
were used: anti-β-actin (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Ang1 (1:100; Bioss, Beijing), anti-Ang2
(1:100; Bioss, Beijing), anti-Tie2 (1:100; Bioss, Beijing).

4.12.

Statistical analysis

The global test using Generalize Estimating Equation (GEE)
was implemented to analyze three correlated functional tests

brain research 1624 (2015) 489–496

per animal, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was
used for the evaluation of histology, respectively(Lu et al.,
2003). “Contract/estimate” statement was used to test the
group difference. Spearman partial correlation coefﬁcient
analysis was employed for the correlation between functional
tests and histology evaluations at day 14 after MCAo. If an
overall treatment group effect was detected at po0.05, pairwise comparisons were made. All data are presented as
mean 7SD.
