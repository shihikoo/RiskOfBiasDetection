Cerebral ischemia evokes neuroinflammatory response. Inflammatory stimulation induces microglial activation, such as
changes of their morphology from ramified to ameboid, expression of iNOS and cytokines, and the elevation of proliferative
activity. Activated microglia play important roles in pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. A previous study indicated that
Sema4D promoted iNOS expression in cultured microglia; however, roles of Sema4D on microglial activation in ischemic
injury remains unclear. We investigated the effect of Sema4D-deficiency on microglial activation by using permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. In this study, ischemia-induced activated microglia were classified into activatedramified microglia and ameboid microglia based on their morphology. We demonstrated that the rate of iNOS expression in
activated-ramified microglia was lower than that in ameboid microglia, while the most proliferating microglia were activatedramified microglia but not ameboid microglia after cerebral ischemia. Sema4D-deficiency decreased the number of ameboid
microglia and iNOS-expressing activated-ramified microglia in the peri-ischemic cortex. These changes by Sema4D-deficiency
contributed to the reduction of NO production that was estimated by nitrite concentration in ischemic cortex. On the other
hand, Sema4D-deficiency promoted proliferation of microglia in the peri-ischemic cortex. Importantly, ischemia-induced apoptosis and postischemic behavioral abnormality were moderated in Sema4D2/2 mice. These findings suggest that Sema4D
promotes cytotoxic activation of microglia and inhibits functional recovery after cerebral ischemia.

Introduction

C

erebral ischemia provokes massive neuronal cell death,
followed by acute inflammation that exacerbates neuronal
damage. Under such a condition, brain resident microglia
exert various changes of their phenotype and convert into
“activated microglia”. In the healthy brain, “resting microglia”
have long and thin branched processes, which continuously
monitor the local microenvironment (Nimmerjahn et al.,
2005; Tremblay et al., 2011; Wake et al., 2009). Upon activation, microglia retract their processes and alter their cellular
morphology to the ameboid shape (Kreutzberg, 1996;
Schilling et al., 2003; Vilhardt, 2005). Activated microglia
upregulate their production of various cytokines that are cytotoxic, proliferative and/or protective (abd-el-Basset and Fedoroff, 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Susana et al., 2008). For
instance, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is upregu-

lated in activated microglia (Moro et al., 2004; Pacher et al.,
2007). iNOS generates nitric oxide (NO) and promotes neuronal cell death in brain ischemia (Lucas et al., 2006; Moro
et al., 2004; Pacher et al., 2007). A previous study reported
that cell cycle inhibition of microglia attenuate microglial
cytotoxicity in cerebral ischemia (Zhang et al., 2009), whereas
another study demonstrated that proliferative microglia
secrete IGF-1 and suppress neuronal apoptosis (LalancetteHebert et al., 2007). These observations indicate that microglial activation contributes to both aggravation of and restoration from the injury in CNS disorders. Microglial activation
is the complex phenomenon and consists of multiple aspects.
An in vitro study reveals that Sema4D, belonging to the
class IV semaphorins, promotes NO production of cultured
microglia (Okuno et al., 2010). Sema4D exists as transmembrane- and secreted forms (Elhabazi et al., 2001, Wang et al,

2001). Accumulating evidence indicates that Sema4D is
involved in immunoregulatory functions, although semaphorins were initially identified as repulsive axon guidance molecules (Kolodkin et al., 1993; Shi et al., 2000). Sema4D is
expressed by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and T cells in the
peripheral tissue (Furuyama et al., 1996; Hall et al., 1996;
Moreau-Fauvarque et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2012).
Sema4D promotes some immune function, such as antibody
production of B cells and antigen-specific T cells induction of
dendritic cells (Hall et al., 1996; Shi et al., 2000). Cerebral
ischemia induces upregulation of Sema4D expression in the
peri-ischemic area (Taniguchi et al., 2009). Microglia express
Plexin B1 and CD72, which are the receptors for Sema4D
(Okuno et al., 2010). However morphological and functional
effects of Sema4D on microglia in cerebral ischemia remain
unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that Sema4Ddeficiency reduced the number of ameboid microglia and
iNOS1 microglia in the peri-ischemic cortex, while Sema4Ddeficiency promoted ischemia-induced proliferation of microglia. Furthermore, apoptosis in the peri-ischemic cortex and
postischemic behavioral abnormality was moderated in
Sema4D2/2 mice. These findings suggest that Sema4D is
involved in aggravation and restoration processes of ischemic
injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals
CB-17/Icr-1/1 Jcl wild-type (WT) and Sema4D-deficient
(Sema4D2/2) mice were used in this study. Sema4D2/2 mice were
obtained by backcrossing Sema4D2/2 C57BL/6 (Taniguchi et al.,
2009) to CB-17/Icr-1/1 Jcl mice 10 times. The Osaka University
Graduate School of Medicine Intramural Animal Care and Use
Committee approved all the animal experiments in this study. We
used as few animals as possible and always minimized their
suffering.

Ischemic Models
To induce permanent focal cerebral ischemia, WT and Sema4D2/2
mice aged 6 weeks were subjected to permanent middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO). In brief, animals were placed
under deep anesthesia induced with medetomidine (0.3 mg/kg),
midazolam (4 mg/kg), and butorphanol (5 mg/kg). Next, the zygomatic arch was removed and a hole was drilled in the cranial bone.
MCA was isolated and electrocauterized at the distal portion of

MCA (Taguchi et al., 2010). Sham-operated mice underwent same
manipulation without MCAO. Animals were kept at (24 6 1)8C,
and food and water were provided ad libitum. At 1-day post operation (PO1), PO3, and PO7 the mice were euthanized with lethal
dosage of pentobarbital, and the brains were removed and cut into
3 mm-thick coronal forebrain sections using slicer.

Immunohistochemistry
Three millimeter thick brain sections were stained with 1% 2.3.5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to confirm the induction of cerebral
ischemia. Following post fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde two
overnight, the brain sections were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose
and frozen in dry ice.
Then, the coronal sections of 30 mm thickness were prepared
using a cryostat and subjected to immunohistochemistry with rabbit
antibody to ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1;
1:1,000, Wako) for microglia, mouse antibody to inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS; 1:1000, BD Transduction Laboratories), goat
antibody to arginase-1 (Arg1; 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat
antibody to Sema4D of extracellular domain (1:500, eBioscience),
and rat antibody to 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 1:1,000,
Abcam) for proliferating cells. These primary antibodies were visualized by using appropriate secondary antibody Cy2/Cy3-labeled antirabbit IgG (1:2,000, Amersham Bioscience), Cy2-labeled anti mouse
IgG (1:2,000, Jackson), Alexa Fluor 555-labeled anti-rat IgG
(1:2,000, KPL), biotin-labeled anti goat IgG (1:2,000, Amersham
Bioscience), and Streptavidin Texas Red (1:2,000, Vector Laboratories). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:5,000, Sigma).

Detection of Proliferative Cells
To reveal proliferative activity after cerebral ischemia, mice were
intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg, Wako) three hours
before euthanasia and removing their brain. To detect BrdU, the
brain sections were treated with 1 N HCl for an hour at 378C
before immunohistochemical staining.

Nitric Oxide Assay
To estimate the concentration of nitric oxide (NO), nitrite content
(NO22) that is a decomposition product of NO, was measured by
using Griess Reagent System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cerebral cortices of the injured side were
homogenized and suspended in DW. Fifty microliters of the suspension or sodium nitrite standards were dispensed to a 96-well plate
followed by the addition of 100 ml Griess reagent. The absorbance
values were measured at 540 nm by using plate reader (Bio-Rad).
DW was served as blank in all experiments. The concentration of
nitrite was calculated with reference to the nitrite standard curve.

Detection of Apoptotic Cells
To detect apoptotic cells, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick 30 -end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Promega),
labeling method of the DNA strand degradation products was performed on the brain sections. The sections were equilibrated in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer for 15 min,
subsequently labeled with TUNEL reaction mix for 60 min at 378C.

To detect apoptotic Iba11 cells, staining of Iba1 was followed by
TUNEL reaction.

Behavioral Analysis
To assess functional outcome after cerebral ischemia, open-field test
was performed using a modified protocol as described previously
(Nakagomi et al., 2009). Sham-operated and MCAO (PO35) mice
of WT and Sema4D–/– were tested. A cubic box made of transparent
acrylic plates without a ceiling (30 3 30 3 30 cm3) was housed in
a ventilated soundproof chamber. An overhead incandescent light
bulb provided room lighting that measured approximately 110 lux
at the center of the test arena. In addition, a fan attached in the
upper part of the wall at one end of the chamber presented a masking noise of 45 dB inside the chamber. On each X and Y lateral side
of the open-field box, two infrared beams were attached 2 cm above
the floor at a 10 cm distance. A flip-flop circuit was set up between
the two beams. Total number of circuit breaks was counted as locomotive behavior. Mice were allowed to explore freely in the openfield area for the initial 10 min.

Analysis
Histological images were captured in the field of view of 320 mm 3
320 mm by using confocal microscopy (FV1000-D; Olympus) and
the ischemic boundary line was located at the left side of the image.
Images at nine regions in the peri-ischemic cortex (320 mm 3 320
mm; three regions per coronal section and three sections per brain)
were analyzed for histological analysis. Peri-ischemic cortex was identified as the cortical region within 320 mm from the ischemic
boundary. To guarantee unbiased stereology, the number of positive
cells was counted independently by two scientists. Statistical significance was calculated with two-way ANOVA with Holm’s post hoc
test. For all analyses, differences were considered statistically significant at the 5% level (P < 0.05). Mean 6 SEM values are presented
in graphs.

Results
Effect of Sema4D-Deficiency on Cell Shape of
Microglia after Cerebral Ischemia
Microglial activation is a dynamic and complex response.
Microglial morphology reflects an aspect of their activation.
To investigate influence of Sema4D-deficiency on microglial
morphology, we performed image analysis by using immunohistochemistry and calculated the number of ameboid Iba11
cells. Image analysis was carried out at the outer boundary of
the ischemia (peri-ischemic cortex) (Fig. 1A). Microglia were
identified by their Iba1 expression, and Iba11 cells were classified into three types (Fig. 1B): resting Iba11 cells, activatedramified Iba11 cells, and ameboid Iba11 cells. Resting Iba11
cells were featured by small cell body and thin-branched
processes. Activated-ramified Iba11 cells also had processes,
but their cell body and processes are thick. Ameboid Iba11
cells had enlarged cell body without processes.
In the intact cortex, resting Iba11 cells existed diffusely,
and there was no activated-ramified and ameboid Iba11 cells in
December 2015

both WT and Sema4D2/2 mice [Figs. 1C(a,b), D]. At PO1,
almost all Iba11 cells became activated-ramified, however the
number of ameboid Iba11 cells is small in both groups [Figs.
1C(c,d), D]. By PO3, ameboid Iba11 cells accumulated in the
region adjacent to the ischemic boundary (left side of the
images) [Figs. 1C(e,f )], and the number of ameboid Iba11 cells
in Sema4D2/2 mice was significantly smaller compared to that
in WT mice in peri-ischemic cortex (Fig. 1D). At PO7, accumulation of Iba11 cells at the ischemic boundary became
remarkable in both groups [Figs. 1C(g,h)], and the number of
ameboid Iba11 cells in Sema4D2/2 mice was comparable with
that in WT mice (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that
Sema4D-deficiency inhibits the increase in the number of ameboid microglia after cerebral ischemia.
Effect of Sema4D-Deficiency on Ischemia-Induced
iNOS Expression in Microglia
iNOS synthesizes NO that shows neurodegenerative effect.
iNOS expression in microglia is involved in cytotoxic activation of microglia (Hu et al., 2012; Miron et al., 2013;
Mosser and Edwards, 2008). We therefore assessed whether
Sema4D-deficiency affects ischemia-induced iNOS expression
in microglia. iNOS was visualized by using immunohistochemistry, and this immunoreactivity was analyzed in the
peri-ischemic cortex.
In the intact cortex including the contralateral cortex of
MCA operated and the cortex of nonoperated mice, all Iba11
cells were resting Iba11 cells, and there were no iNOSexpressing Iba11 cells (Fig. 2A,B). After cerebral ischemia,
Iba11 cells expressed iNOS in the region adjacent to the ischemic boundary, and almost all iNOS1 cells were Iba11 cells in
both WT and Sema4D2/2 mice (Fig. 2A). At PO3, the percentage of iNOS and Iba1 double-positive cells of total Iba11
cells in Sema4D2/2 mice was significantly lower than that in
WT mice (Fig. 2B). At PO7, the percentage of iNOSexpressing Iba11 cells of total Iba11 cells was not significantly
different between WT mice and Sema4D2/2 mice (Fig. 2B).
To elucidate relevance between morphological change and
iNOS expression in microglial activation after cerebral ischemia, the percentage of iNOS1 cells of activated-ramified Iba11
cells and ameboid Iba11 cells were calculated. In WT mice at
PO3, the percentage of iNOS1 cells of ameboid Iba11 cells
was significantly higher than that of activated-ramified Iba11
cells (of ameboid Iba11 cells 5 88.9% 6 1.6% vs of activatedramified Iba11 cells 5 71.2% 6 2.4%; P 5 0.00045) (Fig.
2C,D). Thus, iNOS expression in microglia is more frequent
in ameboid microglia than in activated-ramified microglia. The
percentage of iNOS1 activated-ramified Iba11 cells in the
peri-ischemic cortex was significantly reduced in Sema4D2/2
mice compared with WT mice at PO3, although at PO7 there
was no significant difference between WT and Sema4D2/2

was not significantly different between WT and Sema4D2/2
mice at PO3 and PO7 (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that
Sema4D-deficiency suppresses ischemia-induced iNOS expression in activated-ramified microglia. iNOS synthesizes NO;
thus we examined influence of Sema4D-deficiency on
December 2015

ischemia-induced NO production in the cortex. To estimate
NO concentration, nitrite concentration in the homogenized
cortical hemisphere was measured. Concomitant with iNOS
expression in microglia (Fig. 2B), nitrite concentration was
increased after cerebral ischemia, and nitrite concentration in

significantly lower than that of WT mice at PO3 (Fig. 2E).
iNOS metabolizes L-arginine competitively with arginase-1
(Arg1) (Biswas and Mantovani, 2012; El Kasmi et al., 2008;
Munder et al., 1999). Thus, Arg1-immunoreactive cells were
analyzed and the percentage of Arg1 and Iba1 double-positive
cells of total Iba11 cells is shown (Fig. 2F). In the normal cortex of nonoperated mice, Arg1 and Iba1 double-positive cells
were not detected. Cerebral ischemia induced an increase of
Arg1 expression in Iba11 cells of both genotypes. The percentage of Arg1 and Iba1 double-positive cells was increased until
2254

PO7 in WT mice (significantly higher at PO7 than at PO3);
however, this was not increased after PO3 in Sema4D2/2
mice. There was no significant difference between WT and
Sema4D2/2 mice at PO3 or PO7.

Proliferation of microglia is their activation-related event. We
therefore examined whether Sema4D-deficiency influences proliferation of microglia in the peri-ischemic cortex. To investigate
proliferation of microglia, BrdU was injected intraperitoneally
December 2015

three hours before removing the brain, and BrdU and Iba1
double-positive cells were identified as proliferating microglia.
In the cortex of nonoperated mice and PO1 mice BrdU
and Iba1 double-positive cells were hardly seen; however at

PO3 and 7 the number of BrdU and Iba1 double-positive
cells in the peri-ischemic cortex was increased in both WT
and Sema4D2/2 mice compared with nonoperated mice (Fig.
3A,B). Importantly, at PO3 the number of BrdU and Iba1
double-positive cells in Sema4D2/2 mice was significantly
larger than that in WT mice (Fig. 3B). Thereafter at PO7,
the number of BrdU and Iba1 double-positive cells was not
significantly different between WT and Sema4D2/2 mice
(Fig. 3B).
The effect of Sema4D on iNOS expression was different
depending on cell morphology of microglia (Fig. 2C,D).
Thus, we assessed the number of BrdU1 activated-ramified
Iba11 cells and BrdU1 ameboid Iba11 cells in the periischemic cortex at PO3 and PO7. In WT mice at PO3 and
PO7, most of BrdU and Iba1 double-positive cells were
activated-ramified Iba11 cells (PO3: BrdU1 activatedramified Iba11 cells 5 5.69 6 0.88 vs BrdU1 ameboid Iba11
cells 5 1.30 6 0.22; P 5 0.00080, PO7: BrdU1 activated2256

ramified Iba11 cells 5 7.23 6 1.49 vs BrdU1 ameboid Iba11
cells 5 3.16 6 0.55; P 5 0.025) (Fig. 3C,D). These results
suggest that ischemia-induced proliferation of microglia is
prominent in activated-ramified microglia, and Sema4Ddeficiency promotes the proliferation of activated-ramified
microglia at PO3.
Effect of Sema4D-Deficiency on Cell Death and
Functional Outcome After Cerebral Ischemia
Sema4D-deficiency inhibited the increase in the number of
ameboid microglia and iNOS expression in microglia after
cerebral ischemia (Figs. 1 and 2), while ischemia-induced proliferation of microglia was enhanced by Sema4D-deficiency
(Fig. 3). We therefore assessed whether Sema4D-deficiency
affects cytotoxicity and functional recovery after cerebral
ischemia. No or few TUNEL1 cells were found throughout
the cortex of nonoperated mice and contralateral cortex of
MCAO-operated mice (data not shown). TUNEL analysis

showed that the number of apoptotic cells in the periischemic cortex was significantly smaller in Sema4D2/2 mice
compared with that in WT mice at PO3 and 7 (Fig. 4A,B).
The number of TUNEL-positive Iba11 cells in the periischemic cortex was less than half that of total TUNEL1
cells, and there were no significant differences between WT
and Sema4D2/2 mice at PO3 and 7 (Fig. 4C,D). These
results suggest that the majority of apoptotic cells are nonIba11 cells, and Sema4D-deficiency inhibits ischemia-induced
apoptosis of non-Iba11 cells.
Disinhibition of behavior is related to cortical dysfunction, and thus functional outcome after cerebral injury can be
estimated by disinhibition of locomotor activity using openfield test (Farkas et al., 2003; Nakagomi et al., 2009;
Nakano-Doi et al., 2010). In this study, locomotor activities
of sham-operated and MCAO-operated mice at PO35 were
assessed for the initial 10 minutes. In WT mice, the locomotor activity of MCAO-operated (PO35) mice was significantly
higher than that of sham-operated mice (Fig. 4E), indicating
that cerebral ischemic injury increased locomotor activity. On
the other hand, no difference in locomotor activity was found
between sham-operated Sema4D2/2 mice and MCAOoperated Sema4D2/2 mice at PO35. The locomotor activity
of MCAO-operated Sema4D2/2 mice was significantly lower
than that of MCAO-operated WT mice (Fig. 4E), indicating
that Sema4D-deficiency mitigated postischemic behavioral
abnormality. To investigate whether post-ischemic behavioral
abnormality mitigated by Sema4D-deficiency is affected by
the size of ischemic area, the areas of ipsilateral nonischemic
residual cortex after MCAO and contralateral cortex were
measured by using frontal brain sections stained with thionine. The ratio of the nonischemic area in the ipsilateral cortex to that in the contralateral cortex demonstrated no
significant differences in the residual non-ischemic area
between WT and Sema4D2/2 mice at PO35 (data not
shown). These results indicate that Sema4D-deficiency moderates ischemia-induced behavioral abnormality independently
of ischemic size.
Spatial Relationship of Microglia and Sema4D in
the Peri-Ischemic Cortex
As described above, Sema4D-deficiency affected ischemiainduced alteration in morphology, iNOS expression, proliferative activity of microglia, indicating an involvement of
Sema4D in microglial activation after cerebral ischemia.
Microglia express Plexin B1 and CD72 which are the receptors for Sema4D (Okuno et al., 2010), suggesting a possible
physical relationship between Sema4D1 cells and Iba11
microglia. Sema4D1 cells were visualized by immunohistochemistry using the antibody to the extracellular domain of
Sema4D. Spatial relationships of Sema4D1 cells and Iba11
December 2015

cells in the peri-ischemic cortex were three-dimensionally analyzed by using confocal microscopy (Fig. 5). Immunohistochemical detection of Sema4D was difficult, and we could
detect Sema4D1 cells at PO3 from only three mice out of
thirteen. The number of Sema4D1 cells was 5.06 6 1.78 per
three sections of a mouse, and 60.71 6 7.43% of Sema4D1
cells contacted Iba11 cells. The percentage of Sema4D1 cells
that contacted ameboid Iba11 cells of Sema4D1 cells was
6.6 6 4.16%. High magnification images of x–y, x–z and y–z
axis demonstrated physical contacts between Sema4D1 cells
and Iba11 cells (Fig. 5 lower right; A: x–y axis; B: y–z axis;
C: x–z axis).

Discussion
Microglial activation is closely linked to inflammation. Under
inflammation, microglia change their morphology and express
iNOS that induces neurodegeneration by NO production
(Lucas et al., 2006; Matsuoka et al., 1999; Moro et al., 2004;
Pacher et al., 2007). Sema4D-deficiency inhibited ischemiainduced increases in the number of ameboid microglia, iNOS
expression, and NO production that was estimated by nitrite
concentration, and this deficiency promoted ischemia-induced
proliferation of microglia (Figs. 1D; 2B,E; and 3B).
Ischemia-induced apoptosis of non-Iba11 cells was
reduced in Sema4D2/2 mice (Fig. 4B), although the size of
nonischemic residual area in the injured cortex was not
affected by Sema4D-deficiency. Cerebral ischemia provokes
inflammation, which induces cell death in the peri-infarct
area (Jin et al., 2010; Mergenthaler et al., 2004). Sema4Ddeficiency most likely alleviated inflammation and reduced
cell death in the peri-ischemic cortex, outside the ischemic
area, and then moderated behavioral abnormality after cerebral ischemia, although the cell death reduced by Sema4Ddeficiency did not affect the area of nonischemic residual
cortex.
The open field test is generally used to assess locomotor
activity and anxiety. In this study, we focused on the measurement of cortical dysfunction after cerebral ischemia. Several
reports describe that cortical dysfunction induces disinhibition
of behavior (Farkas et al., 2003) and increases the locomotor
activity assessed by the open-field test (Nakagomi et al.,
2009; Nakano-Doi et al., 2010). Such increase in locomotor
activity by open-field test after cerebral ischemia was confirmed in WT mice but not in Sema4D2/2 mice in this
study (Fig. 4E), indicating that the disinhibition of behavior
induced by ischemia was mitigated in Sema4D2/2 mice. This
suggests that the post-ischemic behavioral abnormality was
mitigated by Sema4D-deficiency.
Sema4D-deficiency suppressed ameboid microglia in
number and iNOS expression of activated-ramified microglia
without affecting that of ameboid microglia (Figs. 1D and
2257

2C,D). Furthermore, ameboid microglia expressed iNOS
more frequently than activated-ramified microglia did (Fig.
2C,D). These results indicate that the decrease in NO production of Sema4D2/2 mice is because of the reduction in
ameboid microglia in number (Fig. 1D) and in iNOS expression of activated-ramified microglia (Fig. 2C). In vitro study
demonstrated that Sema4D-Plexin B1 interaction enhances
iNOS expression of microglia through the activation of
MAPK/ERK (Okuno et al., 2010). MAPK/ERK is activated
by RhoA (Bijian et al., 2005), and RhoA is activated by
Sema4D-binding to Plexin B1 (Swiercz et al., 2002; Zhou
et al., 2014). RhoA gives rise to actin–myosin interactions
and alters the cell morphology to ameboid (Nakamura,
2013), suggesting that RhoA activation by Sema4D-Plexin B1
interaction promoted the increase in iNOS1 ameboid microglia in number.
Proliferation of microglia is also an aspect of their activation (Kreutzberg, 1996; Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2007;
O’Donnell et al., 2002). The effect of Sema4D on cell proliferation is controversial among types of cells. For example,
Sema4D promotes proliferation of B cells (Kumanogoh et al.,
2000; Shi et al., 2000), whereas it inhibits proliferation of
mast cells (Kataoka et al., 2010). Our experiments showed
that Sema4D-deficiency enhanced the proliferation of
activated-ramified microglia (Fig. 3B,C), and the proliferative
activity of ameboid microglia is lower than that of activatedramified microglia in the peri-ischemic cortex (Fig. 3C,D).
Previous studies reported that proliferating microglia secrete
IGF-1 and suppress neuronal apoptosis in ischemic brain,
and selective ablation of proliferating microglia exacerbates
injury of brain ischemia (Audet et al., 2012; LalancetteHebert et al., 2007), indicating that proliferative microglia
are necessary for the recovery from the brain injury. And thus
Sema4D-deficiency can contribute to the recovery from the
cerebral ischemic injury.
The inflammatory response involves the activation of
microglia and microglia are polarized into the activated proinflammatory M1-like phenotype and activated antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype (Hu et al., 2012; Miron
et al., 2013; Mosser and Edwards, 2008). M1-like microglia
express iNOS, while M2-like microglia express Arg1.
Sema4D-deficiency reduced iNOS expression in microglia
without affecting Arg1 expression (Fig. 2B,F). iNOS and
Arg1 metabolize L-arginine competitively (Munder et al.,
1999). iNOS metabolizes L-arginine to NO, while Arg1
metabolizes L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea (Biswas and
Mantovani, 2012; El Kasmi et al., 2008; Gordon, 2003).
L-Ornithine is a precursor of polyamines, which contributes
to the proliferation of cells including microglia (Biswas and
Mantovani, 2012; Gordon, 2003; Mosser and Edwards,
2008). Thus, the change of relative expression level of iNOS
2258

and Arg1 by Sema4D-deficiency contributed to reducing NO
production (Fig. 2E), and it is supposed that polyamines synthesis is promoted in Sema4D2/2 mice. Furthermore, the
increased number of proliferating microglia can contribute to
the recovery from ischemic injury.
In conclusion, Sema4D-deficiency affected ischemiainduced microglial activation in morphology, iNOS expression, and proliferation, and this deficiency most likely
resulted in moderation of cytotoxicity and locomotor behavioral abnormality after cerebral ischemia. Sema4D is involved
in cytotoxic activation of microglia after cerebral ischemia.
Images three-dimensionally taken by confocal microscopy
showed the physical contacts between Sema4D1 cells and
microglia, suggesting possible direct relationships of these cells
as well as correlative relationships of them (Fig. 5). Thus, it is
considered as the possibility that Sema4D interacts with
microglia in a direct manner. These findings suggest that
antagonistic molecules to Sema4D can contribute to restoration and moderate damage after cerebral ischemia.
