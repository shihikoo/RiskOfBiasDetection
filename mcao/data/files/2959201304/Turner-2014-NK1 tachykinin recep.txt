Previous results from our laboratory have shown that blockade of the substance P (SP) pathway with an
NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist signiﬁcantly reduces blood brain barrier breakdown, cerebral edema
and functional deﬁcits following ischemic stroke. However, it is unclear whether removal of all neuropeptides is more efﬁcacious than blocking SP alone. As such, the aim of the present study was to determine
the effect of neuropeptide depletion with capsaicin pre-treatment on functional outcome following acute
ischemic stroke in rats. Animals received 125 mg/kg of capsaicin or equal volume of saline vehicle,
administered subcutaneously over a 3-day period. At 14 days following treatment animals were subject
to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. A subset of animals was treated with
an NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist (NAT) or vehicle at 4 h after the onset of stroke only. The functional outcome of animals was assessed for a 7-day period following stroke using a rotarod device, the
bilateral asymmetry test, modiﬁed neurological severity score, open ﬁeld and angleboard. Although capsaicin pre-treatment improved outcome, treatment with an NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist was
superior in improving post-stroke functional outcome. This data suggests that some neuropeptides
may play a beneﬁcial role following stroke, whilst others such as SP are deleterious.

1. Introduction
Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that the neuropeptide substance P (SP) is increased following ischemic stroke
(Turner and Vink, 2007; Turner et al., 2006, 2011) and is associated
with the development of neurogenic inﬂammation and subsequent
blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, cerebral edema and functional deﬁcits (Turner and Vink, 2007, 2012 Turner et al., 2006,
2011). Blocking the action of SP with an NK1 tachykinin receptor
antagonist is highly efﬁcacious in improving post-stroke outcome
through a reduction in BBB permeability, cerebral edema and functional deﬁcits (Turner et al., 2011; Turner and Vink, 2012). However, these studies speciﬁcally focused on the SP pathway only
and it is therefore unclear what role other neuropeptides may play
following stroke.

Capsaicin, an agent isolated from chilli peppers, is able to stimulate the release of sensory neuropeptides, including SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), to the point of depletion
(Kashiba et al., 1997; Wimalawansa, 1996). In neonatal animals,
capsaicin treatment produces permanent sensory neuropeptide
depletion, whereas in adults it produces transient sensory neuropeptide depletion, reported to last for at least 3 weeks (Kashiba
et al., 1997). Although the effects on levels of individual neuropeptides is highly dependent on the capsaicin dosing regime. Nevertheless, capsaicin treatment is an extremely useful experimental
tool to study the functions of various neuropeptides. Indeed, our
laboratory has shown that pre-treatment with capsaicin markedly
improves outcome following diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) by
reducing BBB dysfunction, cerebral edema and functional deﬁcits
(Nimmo et al., 2004; Vink et al., 2003). The fact that the protection
conferred by capsaicin was almost identical to that conferred by
NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonists conﬁrmed a dominant role
for SP following injury to the brain. As such, we sought to determine whether the depletion of all neuropeptides by capsaicin similarly conveys any protection from the development of functional

deﬁcits following stroke, and whether it was superior to blockade
of SP alone.
2. Materials and methods
All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics
Committees of the University of Adelaide and were conducted
according to guidelines established for the use of animals in experimental research as outlined by the Australian National Health and
Medical Research Council (8th Edition 2013).
2.1. Study design
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (260–320 g; n = 32) were randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups which were as follows:
sham surgery, vehicle pre-treatment, capsaicin pre-treatment,
vehicle post-treatment and NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist
(n-acetyl-l-tryptophan; NAT) post-treatment. NAT (Sigma) was
prepared in sterile saline. Capsaicin (Sigma) was dissolved in a
solution of Tween 80, ethanol and saline. Capsaicin or equal volume of vehicle was administered subcutaneously over a 3-day period at a dose of 125 mg/kg (50 mg/kg on day 1, 50 mg/kg on day 2
and 25 mg/kg on day 3). This procedure has been previously shown
to induce a depletion of neuropeptides lasting for up to 3 weeks
(Kashiba et al., 1997). Neuropeptide depletion after pre-treatment
was conﬁrmed using the eye wipe response to a dilute capsaicin
solution (0.1% in saline), as used clinically. From our previous
trauma studies this regime was found to be effective in ablating
neuropeptides (Nimmo et al., 2004; Vink et al., 2003), with the
level of SP in sensory nerves remaining depleted for up to 3 weeks
using this protocol (Kashiba et al., 1997). 14 days after capsaicin
pre-treatment animals were subject to 2 h middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCA) followed by reperfusion. A sub-group of animals
received no pre-treatment, were subject to 2 h MCA occlusion
and at 2 h after reperfusion they were administered either NAT
(Sigma, 25 lmoles/kg) (Turner et al., 2011) or equal volume of saline vehicle intravenously.
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Animals (n = 26) were anaesthetised with Isoﬂurane (1.5–3%;
Abbott Australasia), intubated and MCA occlusion was performed,
as described in detail elsewhere (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, a 4-0monoﬁlament nylon suture with a rounded tip and coated with
0.1% poly-L-lysine (Sigma) was introduced into the lumen of the
external carotid artery, and advanced 17 mm beyond the external/internal carotid bifurcation, or until elastic resistance was felt,
to occlude the origin of the MCA. Following surgery, Lignocaine
(0.5 ml) was applied to the surgical area and the wound closed.
Anaesthesia was discontinued, and when animals were able to
breathe spontaneously they were extubated and allowed to
recover. Reperfusion of the ischemic territory was achieved at 2 h
after the onset of ischaemia via withdrawal of the suture into the
ECA, under Isoﬂurane anaesthesia. A sub-group of animals (n = 6)
that were surgically prepared but no received no occlusion were
included as sham controls.

1 mm rods. Animals were placed on the device and remained stationary for 10 s. The rotation speed was then increased to a maximum of 30 rpm, with each speed being maintained for 10 s.
Animals were required to grip the rods in order to walk on the
rotarod. The score recorded was when the animal completed the
2 min trial, fell off completely or gripped the rungs for 2 revolutions without walking. The bilateral asymmetry test was used to
assess tactile extinction probing sensory neglect following stroke
(Modo et al., 2000). Brieﬂy, a strip of tape (2 cm  3.5 cm) was
applied to the saphenous part (soft, underside) of the strokeaffected forepaw, time to removal was then recorded. Each trial
lasted 120 s and animals were given two consecutive trials. The
mean of the two trials was taken as the bilateral asymmetry test
latency. A modiﬁed neuroscore was used to assess general neurological function (Li et al., 2000). One point was awarded for the
inability to perform the task or the lack of a tested reﬂex. A score
of 10–15 indicated severe injury, 5–9: moderate injury, 1–4: mild
injury and 0: no observable injury. The open ﬁeld test (Giulian and
Silverman, 1975) was used to assess spontaneous exploratory
behaviour, considered to reﬂect stress and anxiety. The open ﬁeld
comprises a white panelled 1 m  1 m enclosure with 100 equal
10 cm squares marked on the base. Animals were placed in the
centre of the enclosure and allowed to explore for 5 min. The number of squares travelled through by the animals was taken as the
spontaneous exploratory behaviour. Naïve animals explore the
entire open ﬁeld and transverse >150 squares, whereas stroke animals remain in the perimeter and exhibit large amounts of freezing
behaviour. The angleboard was used to assess hemiparesis, a common long-term complication following stroke. Animals were places
on the angleboard apparatus, which was gently and slowly raised
up. The angle at which the animals lost their footing and slid
was the angleboard score that was recorded. Animals had 2 trials
each on the stroke-affected side, the mean of which was taken as
their angleboard score.
2.4. Statistical analysis
All parametric data are expressed as mean and SEM, non-parametric data is expressed as the median. Statistical differences were
determined using ANOVA followed by individual Student Newman
Keuls post hoc tests (GraphPad Prism Software). Non-parametric
data was analysed using a two-tailed non-parametric ANOVA followed by a Mann–Whitney U test. A p value of 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
There was no signiﬁcant difference (p > 0.05; results not shown)
observed between the vehicle pre-treatment and post-treatment
groups, demonstrating that injured animals perform similarly, irrespective of the time or route of vehicle administration. As such, the
data for these groups was combined and they are represented as
the ‘‘vehicle’’ group on all of the functional outcome measures. A
summary of the statistical comparisons between all groups for
the functional outcome tests is shown in Table 1.

2.3. Functional outcome
Commencing at 24 h post-reperfusion, animals were assessed
daily using the rotarod, bilateral asymmetry test, the modiﬁed
neuroseverity score and the angleboard on days 1–7 post-stroke
and the open ﬁeld on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post-stroke. Motor deﬁcits
were assessed using a rotarod device (Hamm et al., 1994), which
comprises a metal frame with a rotating assembly of eighteen

Vehicle-treated group showed marked functional deﬁcits
(p < 0.001 compared to shams), which improved only modestly
by day 7 (Fig. 1A). Capsaicin-treated animals showed an initial
decline in motor function on day 1 with motor scores signiﬁcantly
worse than shams (p < 0.001) on days 1–6. But their performance
gradually improved over the assessment period to levels comparable to shams (p > 0.05) by day 7. Animals treated with NK1 tachy-

kinin receptor antagonist showed an initial decline in motor function but rapidly improved to normal functional levels by day 3
post-stroke, performing signiﬁcantly better than vehicle-treated
animals (p < 0.001) on days 2–7 post-stroke. Capsaicin-treated animals scored consistently lower (p < 0.001) on the rotarod compared to NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated animals on
days 2–6 post-stroke, and recovery of motor function was accelerated in the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated group compared to the capsaicin-treated group.

3.2. Sensory function – bilateral asymmetry test
Vehicle-treated animals showed profound sensory deﬁcits, with
time to removal was signiﬁcantly greater (p < 0.001) than shams
on all days post-stroke (Fig. 1B). The capsaicin-treated animals
recorded latencies signiﬁcantly better that vehicles on days 1 and
3–7 post-stroke (0.001 < p < 0.01), reaching normal functional levels by day 3 post-stroke. Similarly, the NK1 tachykinin receptor
antagonist group reached normal functional levels by day 3 poststroke, recording latencies better than vehicle-treated animals
(0.001 < p < 0.01) on days 3–7 post-stroke. Although NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated animals demonstrated a more
rapid recovery in sensory function, as compared to the capsaicintreated animals, this trend was not signiﬁcant.

3.3. Neurological function – modiﬁed neuroseverity score
Following stroke, vehicle animals consistently recorded an
mNSS ranking of 6 or more (Fig. 2A), indicative of moderate injury
(p < 0.001 compared to shams on all days). In comparison, both the
NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist and capsaicin-treated groups
demonstrated a recovery of neurological function over the 7-day
assessment period, recording neurological scores comparable to
shams (p > 0.05). The NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist group
performed at levels signiﬁcantly better than vehicle-treated animals (p < 0.05), whilst the capsaicin group did not (p > 0.05).
Despite this, there was no signiﬁcant (p > 0.05) difference between
the capsaicin-treated and NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonisttreated groups.
3.4. Spontaneous exploratory behaviour – open ﬁeld
Following stroke, vehicle-treated animals consistently travelled
through less than 50 squares on all assessment days and no
improvement was observed over time (Fig. 2B), their activity was
signiﬁcantly lower than shams on days 1 (p < 0.01) and 3
(p < 0.05) post-stroke. Capsaicin-treated animals performed significantly worse than shams on day 1 post-stroke (p < 0.05) but then
demonstrated an improved activity score on days 3–7 that was
comparable to shams (p > 0.05). However, despite a trend towards
increased exploratory behaviour compared to vehicle-treated animals these differences were not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05). In contrast,
NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated animals demonstrated
activity levels comparable to shams (p > 0.05) on all days poststroke. Their spontaneous exploratory behaviour levels were signiﬁcantly higher (0.001 < p < 0.05) than vehicle-treated animals
on all assessment days. There was no signiﬁcant difference

towards an increased number of squares by the NK1 tachykinin
receptor antagonist-treated group.

3.5. Hemiparesis – angleboard
Vehicle-treated animals demonstrated profound and persistent
hemiparesis following stroke (Fig. 2C). No improvement in angleboard performance was observed, with scores signiﬁcantly worse
(p < 0.001) than shams on all days post-stroke. In contrast, the
capsaicin-treated group showed improved angleboard performance over time, scoring signiﬁcantly better than vehicles
(0.01 < p < 0.001) and comparable to shams (p > 0.05) on all assessment days. Similarly, a reduction in hemiparesis was observed over
time in the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist group, as evidenced by improved angleboard scores. This group performed signiﬁcantly better (0.05 < p < 0.001) than vehicle-treated animals on
all assessment days, reaching normal functional levels. There was
no signiﬁcant (p > 0.05) difference between the capsaicin-treated
and NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated groups.

We demonstrate that depletion of neuropeptides prior to cerebral ischaemia results in attenuation of functional deﬁcits. Indeed,
a role for neuropeptides and neurogenic inﬂammation in BBB dysfunction, cerebral edema and functional deﬁcits following ischemic
stroke (Turner and Vink, 2007; Turner et al., 2006, 2011) and TBI
(Donkin et al., 2007, 2009; Nimmo et al., 2004; Vink et al., 2004)
has recently been demonstrated.
In the present study, pre-treatment with capsaicin was associated with an improvement in motor, sensory and neurological
function, in addition to reduced hemiparesis compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, treatment with an NK1 tachykinin
receptor antagonist produced a more rapid recovery in motor
and sensory function and a complete recovery in spontaneous
exploratory behaviour following stroke when compared to capsaicin. Nonetheless, the overall trend was that NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated animals demonstrated superior functional
recovery when compared to capsaicin-treated animals. The fact
that the functional recovery of the capsaicin-treated group was
not comparable to that of the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist-treated group across all tests suggests that one or more of
the neuropeptides may have a beneﬁcial role following stroke.
One such candidate is CGRP, the most potent endogenous vasodilator that acts to increase local blood ﬂow. Intravenous administration of CGRP in rats produces a transient increase in mean arterial
blood pressure (Wimalawansa, 1996). However, CGRP is also
involved in a number of other biological processes other than vascular regulation including sensory transmission, neuromodulation
at the neuromuscular junction and nociception (Wimalawansa,
1996). Indeed, protective roles for CGRP in ischemia have previously been reported in peripheral tissues (Kjartansson and
Dalsgaard, 1987). In a model of pancreatic ischemia/reperfusion
injury, the ablation of neuropeptides was found to aggravate the
ischemic damage (Dembinski et al., 2003), with the authors concluding that the lack of CGRP was detrimental to ischemic tissue.
CGRP has also been found to improve the survival of ischemic surgical ﬂap tissue (Bucinskaite et al., 1998; Kjartansson and
Dalsgaard, 1987). The proposed mechanism of CGRP-induced protection was the promotion of angiogenesis within the tissue. Taken
together, these studies suggest a potential protective role for CGRP
in the setting of ischemia. In the context of the present study, this
protective function may be quite modest. Furthermore, with
respect to the central nervous system, Liu et al. reported on the
effects of CGRP administration following stroke (Liu et al., 2011).
They found that exogenous CGRP administered at the onset of
reperfusion profoundly decreased edema, BBB permeability and
expression of the aquaporin 4 water channel, in addition to preserved microvascular integrity. The proposed mechanism of protection was through direct restoration of blood ﬂow within
penumbral tissue and improvement in BBB status. Indeed, CGRP
has been shown to confer protection from hypoxia/reoxygenation
injury afforded by leptin (Zhang et al., 2011), with a CGRP antagonist found to abolish this protective effect on neuron survival. Furthermore, deletion of CGRP increases the vulnerability of cardiac
tissue to ischemia/reperfusion injury (Huang et al., 2008). Clearly,
these studies support beneﬁcial role for CGRP in ischemia/stroke.
Although many studies have used capsaicin as an experimental
tool to study neuropeptides (Dembinski et al., 2003; Turchanyi
et al., 2005), few studies have investigated behavioural outcome
end-points following capsaicin pre-treatment (Nimmo et al.,
2004; Vink et al., 2003), and even fewer have studied cerebral
ischaemia. Administration of capsaicin 5 min after recirculation
completely protected against global cerebral ischaemia, as indicated by a recovery in spontaneous motor activity, memory and
preservation of hippocampal CA1 neuron density (Pegorini et al.,

R.J. Turner, R. Vink / Neuropeptides 48 (2014) 267–272

2005). These authors were unsure of the mechanism whereby capsaicin treatment afforded protection but speculated that following
ischaemia the release of neuropeptides from sensory nerves could
be involved. Yet, our previous ﬁndings clearly demonstrate a deleterious role for the neuropeptide SP following cerebral ischaemia
(Turner and Vink, 2007, 2012 Turner et al., 2006, 2011). Our ﬁndings are consistent with those we have previously reported in
TBI, that reveal that capsaicin-induced neuropeptide depletion
prior to injury is protective (Nimmo et al., 2004; Vink et al., 2003).
When SP and CGRP are present in concert, CGRP may potentiate
the effects of SP-induced neurogenic inﬂammation (Black, 2002;
Holzer, 1998; Richardson and Vasko, 2002). As such, antagonism
of the SP pathway alone, through administration of an NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist may provide a favourable cerebral environment following stroke. Speciﬁcally, the action of SP is blocked
so that deleterious neurogenic inﬂammation is circumvented, but
the released CGRP may nonetheless have some favourable effects
on the cerebral vasculature. This was not observed in previous
studies of TBI (Nimmo et al., 2004; Vink et al., 2003), although it
could be hypothesised that an improved vascular response would
have little efﬁcacy in TBI without an ischemic component. Nonetheless, similar ﬁndings have been reported following ischemia–
reperfusion injury in peripheral tissues. The absence of sensory
neuropeptides was found to be beneﬁcial in long durations of
ischemia (2 h) of skeletal muscle due to inhibition of neurogenic
inﬂammation (Turchanyi et al., 2005), whereas the absence of neuropeptides in shorter durations of ischemia (1 h) was found to be
unfavourable. This group suggested that this was due to the lack
of vasodilator neuropeptides that improve microcirculation. Similarly, tissue damage following ischemia/reperfusion injury of the
pancreas was aggravated by neuropeptide depletion, presumably
because of a lack of CGRP (Dembinski et al., 2003).
The superior performance of NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonist treated animals over the capsaicin-treated animals may, in
part, be due to the blockade of SP and its effects on BBB permeability, cerebral oedema and inﬂammation. Indeed, SP is a known
potent initiator of neurogenic inﬂammation, documented by our
research group to occur in the central nervous system following
and characterised by profound alterations in BBB permeability
and the development of vasogenic edema and persistent neurological deﬁcits. NK1 tachykinin receptors on the vascular endothelium
contribute to tissue swelling (Stumm et al., 2001). Given that cerebral oedema is a known predictor of poor outcome clinically, preventing this by blockade of the SP pathway improves not only
survival but also functional outcome (Turner et al., 2011; Turner
and Vink, 2012). Indeed, NK1 tachykinin receptor knockout mice
are unable to produce edema (Cao et al., 1999), further supporting
a role for SP in this deleterious pathway following stroke.
SP has pleiotropic actions beyond that of neurogenic inﬂammation including interactions with matrix metalloproteinases (Ramos
et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2007), glutamate (Lieberman and Mody,
1998; Stacey et al., 2002), cell death pathways (Castro-Obregon
et al., 2002) and inﬂammation (Guo et al., 2004). Given the contribution of inﬂammation to injury following stroke the effect of SP
blockade on this aspect of the injury cascade cannot be ignored.
SP is known to activate the immune system and to modulate
immune responses and inﬂammation (Guo et al., 2004). For example, SP can induce the dose-dependent release of cytokines such as
IL-1 TNF-a (Lotz et al., 1988) and IL-6 (Brain, 1997; Fiebich et al.,
2000; Yamaguchi et al., 2004), act as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils (Braun et al., 1996) and monocytes (Ruff et al., 1985)
whilst stimulating the production of superoxide and phagocytic
activity of neutrophils (Bar-Shavit et al., 1980) and thereby exacerbating injury. SP agonists induce a dose-dependent production of
oxygen radical species and cytokine release (Bardelli et al., 2005).
As such, SP may be involved in the recruitment and activity of

271

inﬂammatory cells into the infarct, thus contributing to the inﬂammatory response and evolution of the stroke lesion. Although we
did not measure aspects of the inﬂammatory response in our study,
it is likely the SP blockade, and indeed capsaicin pre-treatment,
was able to decrease the contribution of these pathways to the
post-stroke injury. Indeed, previous studies have shown that
blockade of the NK1 tachykinin receptor decreases the recruitment
and activation of neutrophils (Mak et al., 2003) and macrophages
(Rittner et al., 2007), activation of the endothelium, production of
nitric oxide (Mak et al., 2003) and TNF-a release (Souza et al.,
2002).
Ablation of neuropeptides by treatment with capsaicin provided
protection from the ischemic insult through a reduction in functional deﬁcits. However, the overall trend was that NK1 tachykinin
receptor antagonist-treated animals performed equal or superior
to capsaicin-treated animals, indicating that an NK1 tachykinin
receptor antagonist is more effective in reducing functional deﬁcits, speciﬁcally motor deﬁcits, compared to capsaicin. These
results suggested that one or more of the neuropeptides may have
a beneﬁcial role following stroke, and this is most likely to be
CGRP. Nevertheless, depletion of neuropeptides provides a degree
of protection from functional deﬁcits following ischemic stroke,
conﬁrming that sensory neuropeptides play a signiﬁcant role in
the post-ischemic secondary injury process and may offer a novel
target for the development of interventional pharmacology. Further studies are required to elucidate the protective mechanism
of the NK1 tachykinin receptor antagonists following stroke.
