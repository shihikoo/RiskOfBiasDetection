Background and Purpose—Prolonged ischemia causes blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage and increases the incidence of
neurovasculature complications secondary to reperfusion. Therefore, targeting ischemic BBB damage pathogenesis is
critical to reducing neurovasculature complications and expanding the therapeutic time window of tissue-type plasminogen
activator (tPA) thrombolysis. This study investigates whether increasing cerebral tissue PO2 through normobaric hyperoxia
(NBO) treatment will slow the progression of BBB damage and, thus, improve the outcome of delayed tPA treatment
after cerebral ischemia.
Methods—Rats were exposed to NBO (100% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) during 3-, 5-, or, 7-hour middle cerebral artery
occlusion. Fifteen minutes before reperfusion, tPA was continuously infused to rats for 30 minutes. Neurological score,
mortality rate, and BBB permeability were determined. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 was measured by gelatin zymography
and tight junction proteins (occludin and cluadin-5) by Western blot in the isolated cerebral microvessels.
Results—NBO slowed the progression of ischemic BBB damage pathogenesis, evidenced by reduced Evan blue leakage,
smaller edema, and hemorrhagic volume in NBO-treated rats. NBO treatment reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9
induction and the loss of tight junction proteins in ischemic cerebral microvessels. NBO-afforded BBB protection was
maintained during tPA reperfusion, resulting in improved neurological functions, significant reductions in brain edema,
hemorrhagic volume, and mortality rate, even when tPA was given after prolonged ischemia (7 hours).
Conclusions—Early NBO treatment slows ischemic BBB damage pathogenesis and significantly improves the outcome of
delayed tPA treatment, providing new evidence supporting NBO as an effective adjunctive therapy to extend the time window
of tPA thrombolysis for ischemic stroke.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1344-1351. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008599.)

hrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)
is the only Food and Drug Administration–approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke, but it has a narrow therapeutic
time window of 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke onset.1 Delayed tPA
treatment leads to severe complications, such as intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) and edema, because of reperfusion into
weakened or necrotic brain microvasculature.2,3 Blood–brain
barrier (BBB) damage after ischemic stroke is a dynamic process with an initial damage during ischemia4 and a secondary injury during reperfusion.2,5,6 Prolonged ischemia leads
to severe BBB damage that dramatically increases the risk
of complications after tPA thrombolysis. Therefore, preserving BBB integrity during ischemia is of critical importance in
ensuring that the microvasculature will safely withstand the
return of blood flow.

Oxygen therapy aimed at increasing tissue partial pressure
of oxygen (PO2) has long been considered a logic treatment for
ischemic stroke.7 Several animal studies have shown that short
duration of normobaric hyperoxia (NBO) treatment is highly
neuroprotective if started early after ischemia onset.8–12 A pilot
clinical study also demonstrated that NBO therapy was associated with a transient improvement of clinical deficits and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in patients with acute
ischemic stroke.13 These studies have demonstrated that early
NBO treatment can slow the progression of ischemic brain tissue to necrosis, thus improving the therapeutic time window
for reperfusion therapies. We have shown that besides neuroprotection, NBO can also protect the BBB against ischemic
damage through inhibiting reactive oxygen species production14,15 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)–mediated

degradation of tight junction proteins (TJPs).16–18 However, the
time window for vasoprotection of NBO remains unknown.
In this study, we investigated how, and to what extent, early
NBO treatment could slow the progression of ischemic BBB
damage using a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. In addition, we investigated whether the vasoprotection afforded by
NBO during cerebral ischemia was effective in reducing the
neurovascular complications associated with delayed tPA
treatment.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model of Focal Cerebral Ischemia

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical
University approved all animal experiments. Male Sprague-Dawley
rats (n=144) weighing 290 to 320 g were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
followed by reperfusion using the suture occlusion model, as we previously described.18 Successful MCAO was confirmed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining.18
Although suture model is not directly relevant to thromboembolic
ischemia in patients, this stable model would allow us to compare
the different effects of NBO/normoxia on tPA’s complications under
identical and controlled ischemia and reperfusion conditions. In contrast, the more clinically relevant model of injecting a preformed clot
into MCA is not most suitable for this investigative study because we
cannot predict how long and where the clot will occlude MCA.

Experimental Design
To investigate the NBO’s ability to slow the progression of ischemic
BBB damage and its effect on the neurovascular complications of delayed tPA treatment, we chose 3 ischemia durations: 3 hours (within
the established 3–4.5 hours thrombolytic time window), 5 hours, and
7 hours (outside the window). We chose 2 reperfusion time points, 2
hours after reperfusion onset and 24 hours after MCAO onset. tPA
was intravenously infused for 30 minutes at 15 minutes before reperfusion, mimicking tPA thrombolysis in clinical settings.
Rats with successful MCAO were randomly assigned to
4 groups: normoxia+MCAO (n=30), NBO+MCAO (n=30),
normoxia+tPA+MCAO (n=27), and NBO+tPA+MCAO (n=27). Each
group was further divided into 3 subgroups with 3-, 5-, or 7-hour
MCAO followed by 2-hour reperfusion. Another 30 rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups to assess mortality rate at 24 hours after
MCAO onset: normoxia+3-hour tPA (n=6), NBO+3-hour tPA (n=5),
normoxia+7-hour tPA (n=10), and NBO+7-hour tPA (n=9). The experimental design is schematically illustrated in Figure 1A.
We chose to assess NBO’s BBB protection at 2 hours after reperfusion for 2 reasons: (1) to minimize the effect of reperfusion on BBB
damage while allowing Evan blue dye (EB) to circulate around the
damaged BBB and (2) to minimize the number of animals needed as
prolonged reperfusion causes high mortality rate.18 The reason for assessing tPA’s neurovascular complications at 24 hours after ischemia
was because tPA-associated ICH and mortality occur within 36 hours
after tPA administration.19,20

NBO Treatment
All animals exhibited rapid recovery from anesthesia within 5 minutes post MCAO surgery. When rats could freely move at 10 minutes
post MCAO onset, we put them into an anesthesia box that was ventilated (5 L/min) with air (21% O2, normoxia) or 100% O2 (NBO)
until 30 minutes before the end of MCAO. 100% O2 was chosen
as the NBO treatment because our previous study demonstrated
that rats breathing this O2 concentration were able to maintain the
ischemic penumbral PO2 close to the preischemic level.10 For convenience and precise control, the rats were taken out of NBO exposure
box for tPA infusion 30 minutes before reperfusion, thus terminating
NBO treatment.

tPA Administration
tPA (10 mg/kg; Biberach, Germany) was infused into rats through the
right femoral vein at 15 minutes before reperfusion onset, and the infusion continued for another 15 minutes after withdrawal of the suture.
This regimen achieved a fibrinolytic effect in rats and made the reperfused tissue fully exposed to tPA, mimicking clinical tPA treatment.18

Measurement of Neurological Deficits
At the end of 2-hour reperfusion, neurological deficits were assessed double blinded with 2 methods: Zea-Longa score21 and Ludmila Belayev.22

Tissue Collection and Measurement of Infarction
and Edema
At the end of 2-hour reperfusion, the rats were transcardially perfused with 250 mL of cold PBS. Brains were sectioned into six 2-mm
coronal slices from a 12-mm thick region 3 mm away from the tip of
the frontal lobe. The third slice was stained using 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to measure the infarct size. The 2-mm thick
brain slices were digitally photographed to assess brain edema by
measuring hemispheric enlargement. After photographing, the tissue
was collected for quantitatively measuring hemorrhagic volume or
for cerebromicrovessel isolation.
An indirect method for calculating infarct volume was used to
minimize error introduced by edema.23 The noninfarcted region in the

ipsilateral hemisphere was subtracted from that in the contralateral
hemisphere. The infarct size was presented as a percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere.

Evaluation of EB Leakage
EB (2% wt/vol in PBS, 3 mL/kg; Sigma) was administered intravenously in the tail vein at the onset of reperfusion. At the end of 2-hour
reperfusion, the rats were transcardially perfused with PBS. The brain
was then removed, sectioned, and photographed to visualize EB extravasation. BBB disruption was quantitatively assessed by measuring
EB contents in ischemic hemispheric tissue as previously reported.16

Spectrophotometric Assay of Cerebral Hemorrhage
Cerebral hemorrhage was quantified using QuantiChrom Hemoglobin
Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward) as previously described.24

Measurement of Brain Edema
Brain edema was assessed by measuring the hemispheric areas of
each 2-mm thick brain slice on the digital photographs obtained using
Image J software (National Institutes of Health) as described previously.14 Edema was expressed as a ratio of ischemic hemispheric area
versus nonischemic hemispheric area.

Isolation of Cerebral Microvessels
Isolation of cerebral microvessels was performed as described in our
previous study.14

Measurement of MMP-9, Occludin, and Claudin-5
in Isolated Microvessels
MMP-9 levels were measured by gelatin zymography, and occludin
and claudin-5 protein levels were measured by Western blot in the
isolated microvessels, as described in our previous studies.14,17

Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean±SEM. Statistical analysis was carried
out using X2 test and 1-way ANOVA. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
NBO Slows the Evolution of Ischemic BBB Damage
To determine whether NBO could slow down the evolution
of ischemic BBB damage, we compared the severity of BBB
damage with or without NBO treatment after 3, 5, or 7 hours
of ischemia followed by 2-hour reperfusion. Figure 1B
shows the EB extravasation after 3, 5, or 7 hours of cerebral
ischemia. As expected, EB contents in nonischemic hemispheric tissue were low under all tested stroke conditions
(Figure 1B). Cerebral ischemia drastically increased EB
content in the ischemic hemispheric tissue of the normoxic
group, and greater EB leakage was seen for longer ischemic
duration. NBO treatment decreased EB extravasation for all
3 ischemic durations with the largest reduction occurring
for 7-hour ischemia.
ICH was seen in the ischemic hemisphere of normoxic
rats after ischemia, with longer ischemia durations inducing greater bleeding volumes (Figure 2A). Similar to EB
extravasation, NBO treatment reduced the severity of ICH
for all 3 ischemic durations. A small amount of hemoglobin
was detected in the nonischemic hemisphere of all rats, likely
because of residual blood left in the cerebral vasculature after
transcardial perfusion.
We also assessed brain edema and observed that longer
ischemia durations induced more severe brain edema in normoxic rats (Figure 2B). When the rats were treated by NBO
during cerebral ischemia, the hemispheric enlarging process
appeared to be frozen at the level of 3-hour ischemia because
the edematic volume remained unchanged even if the ischemic duration was prolonged to 7 hours.
These results clearly indicate that NBO treatment can slow
the evolution of ischemic BBB damage, potentially expanding
the therapeutic time window.

NBO Slows the Process of MMP-9 Induction and
the Loss of TJPs in Ischemic Microvessels
We next studied the mechanisms by which NBO treatment
slowed the evolution of ischemic BBB damage. MMP-9 induction and increased TJP degradation are 2 well-studied events
critically contributing to BBB damage in ischemic stroke.25
MMP-9 band was faint in nonischemic microvascular extracts
of all groups (Figure 3A). MMP-9 induction increased with
increasing ischemic duration in the ischemic microvessels.
Concurrently, both occludin and claudin-5 protein levels in
the microvessels decreased with increasing ischemic duration
(Figure 3B). Importantly, NBO treatment attenuated MMP-9
induction and restored the loss of occludin and claudin-5 protein in ischemic microvessels. These findings suggest that
NBO treatment can slow the process of MMP-9 induction
and the loss of occludin and claudin-5 proteins in ischemic
microvessels.

NBO Slows MMP-9 Induction and TJP Loss
in Ischemic Microvessels After Delayed tPA
Administration
The results above clearly showed that NBO treatment could
slow the evolution of BBB damage and inhibit 2 key BBBdamaging events, ie, MMP-9 induction and TJPs degradation, for a prolonged time window. We wondered whether
NBO-afforded BBB protection would remain after delayed

tPA treatment and thus expanding tPA’s therapeutic time window. To test this, we assessed MMP-9 induction, TJP protein
loss, EB extravasation, hemorrhagic volume, and brain edema
under the same experimental regimen as described above
except that tPA was administered at the end of each indicated
ischemic duration.
Administration of tPA did not affect MMP-9 levels in the
nonischemic microvessels of the normoxic rats (Figure 4A).
However, the induction of MMP-9 was elevated and saturated
in normoxic rats after tPA administration because all 3 ischemic durations induced the same level of MMP-9 induction.
Importantly, NBO treatment abolished MMP-9 induction in
the ischemic microvessels of tPA-treated rats for all 3 ischemic durations.
As expected, ischemia caused an ischemia duration–
dependent loss of occludin and claudin-5 proteins in ischemic microvessels after tPA administration (Figure 4B).
Interestingly, NBO treatment did not reduce occludin and
claudin-5 loss induced by 3-hour MCAO plus tPA administration; however, it prevented the further loss of these proteins in
rats with 5- and 7-hour ischemic durations.

NBO Slows Down the Deterioration of BBB in
Delayed tPA Treatment
Cerebral ischemia with tPA administration led to an ischemia duration dependently increased in EB extravasation
in ischemic tissue (Figure 5A). NBO treatment reduced EB

extravasation in tPA-treated rats with 3-, 5-, or 7-hour MCAO.
Similarly, hemoglobin contents in the ischemic tissue of
normoxia+tPA-treated rats increased in an ischemia duration–
dependent manner, whereas NBO treatment reduced cerebral
hemorrhage in tPA-treated rats (Figure 5B). Brain edema was
progressively worsened with prolongation of MCAO durations, and NBO treatment slowed this deteriorating process
(Figure 5C). These results indicated that NBO-afforded BBB
protection during cerebral ischemia was sustained after tPA
administration.

NBO Reduces the Neurovascular Complications
Associated With Delayed tPA Treatment
Finally, we sought to determine whether NBO-afforded BBB
protection could result in reductions in the neurovascular
complications associated with delayed tPA treatment. The
infarction volume increased with the prolongation of MCAO
duration in normoxic rats (Figure 6A). Combined treatment
of NBO with tPA reduced the infarction volume for all groups
with 3-, 5-, and 7-hour ischemic durations. Similar protective effects of NBO were observed for neurological function assessment using Zea-Longa (Figure 6B) and Ludmila
Belayev scores (Figure 6C).
Mortality rate in tPA-treated rats was assessed at the end
of 24 hours of reperfusion (Figure 6D). tPA administration
after 7-hour MCAO under normoxia condition resulted in a
high mortality rate, which was dramatically reduced by NBO

treatment. These results indicate that tPA alone is safe to use
within the currently prescribed 3-hour window, but NBO
could potentially expand tPA’s therapeutic time window for
ischemic stroke beyond this time limit, at least to 7 hours.

Discussion
The clinical use of tPA has been profoundly constrained
because of the narrow therapeutic time window and the potentially devastating hemorrhagic complications. Previous studies
showed that NBO given during cerebral ischemia is neuroprotective and vasoprotective in a rat model of transient cerebral
ischemia.10,14–16,18,26 Here, we demonstrated that NBO treatment effectively slowed the progression of ischemia-induced
BBB disruption, thus expanding the window of opportunity
for other drug treatment. Using tPA as an example, we showed
that comparing with tPA alone, combined NBO/tPA treatment
led to significant improvement in neurological outcomes and
reductions in brain edema, ICH severity, and mortality rate
after delayed tPA treatment, despite prolonged ischemia duration (≤7 hours). Our results suggest that NBO could be used
as an adjunct therapy to expand the therapeutic time window
of tPA thrombolysis for ischemic stroke.
To maximize tPA’s benefit in treating patients with acute
stroke, 2 conditions have to be met at the time of tPA administration: a salvageable penumbra and low risk of severe
neurovascular complications. Any treatment that can slow
the evolution of ischemic penumbra to irreversible injury

or reduce tPA’s neurovascular complications would serve as
an effective adjuvant therapy to improve the efficacy of tPA
thrombolysis. We and others have shown that NBO given
during cerebral ischemia can preserve the ischemic penumbra.10,26–28 We have also demonstrated that NBO could protect
the BBB against ischemic damage.14–18 In this context, NBO
has been suggested as an ideal adjunct therapy to improve
tPA’s efficacy and safety.7,8,29 Here, our findings show that
NBO treatment can effectively reduce EB extravasation, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain edema despite prolonged ischemia
of ≤7 hours, indicating that NBO-afforded BBB protection is
sustained after tPA administration. These results indicate that
NBO may have the potential to serve as an adjuvant therapy
to safely widen the narrow time window of tPA thrombolysis
for ischemic stroke.
MMP-9 is induced in ischemic brain tissue and critically contributes to BBB disruption, brain edema formation, and ICH via proteolytic degradation of BBB structural
components, including TJPs.30–32 Here, our data show that
MMP-9 is induced in ischemic cerebral microvessels in

an ischemic duration–dependent manner, and this change
is accompanied by the loss of the TJPs occludin and claudin-5. NBO treatment ameliorated MMP-9 induction and
TJP loss. Interestingly, in NBO-treated rats, the changes
of MMP-9 and TJPs appeared to be frozen to a degree
observed for 3-hour MCAO because no significant further
changes were observed for longer ischemic durations, ie,
5- and 7-hour MCAO. Interestingly, although NBO significantly decreased the infarct volume when compared with
the normoxia group, it did not freeze it at 3-hour MCAO
level, suggesting that (1) vasoprotective and neuroprotective
effects of NBO are likely because of 2 separate processes
and (2) NBO treatment affords greater vasoprotection than
neuroprotection. Future work is warranted to understand
this unexpected finding.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NBO treatment can slow the progression of BBB damage even during
prolonged periods of cerebral ischemia, and inhibiting MMP-9
induction and TJP degradation may account for this protection.
More importantly, NBO-afforded BBB protection sustains after

tPA administration, which results in significant reductions in
the neurovascular complications associated with delayed tPA
treatment and improved neurological function. However, rationally designed clinical studies with well-defined patient population are needed to validate whether NBO is a viable, safe, and
efficacious adjuvant therapy for ischemic stroke.
