ABSTRACT
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a beneficial
role in the sub-acute phase after ischemic stroke.
However, unrestrained MMP-9 may disrupt the
blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has limited its use
for the treatment of brain ischemia. In the present
study, we constructed lentivirus mediated hypoxiacontrolled MMP-9 expression and explored its role
after stroke. Hypoxia response element (HRE)
was used to confine MMP-9 expression only to the
hypoxic region of mouse brain after 120-min transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion. Lentiviruses were
injected into the peri-infarct area on day 7 after
transient ischemia. We found hyperexpression of
exogenous HRE-MMP-9 under the control of hypoxia,
and its expression was mainly located in neurons
and astrocytes without aggravation of BBB damage
compared to the CMV group. Furthermore, mice in
the HRE-MMP-9 group showed the best behavioral
recovery compared with the normal saline, GFP, and
SB-3CT groups. Therefore, hypoxia-controlled MMP9 hyperexpression during the sub-acute phase of
ischemia may provide a novel promising approach of
gene therapy for stroke.

the second most common cause of death worldwide [1].
Over the past two decades, research on brain ischemia
has been focused on pathophysiology and therapies
including gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, and drug
interference[2-4]. Among them, gene therapy has been the
most extensively studied in recent years. Non-viral gene
delivery is safer than virus-mediated delivery but is limited
by its inefficiency[5]. Compared to the adenovirus-associated
virus, lentivirus has a large packaging capacity (8 kb) and
maintains persistent gene transfer in most tissues[6], so we
used lentivirus-mediated gene therapy.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of
zinc-dependent endopeptidases with over 20 members,
which can degrade almost all proteinaceous components
of the extracellular matrix [7]. MMPs are produced in a
latent form and participate in many physiological and
pathological processes after activation[8]. MMP-2 (gelatinase
A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) are expressed in the brain
and can be easily identified by zymography during brain
injury and repair [8, 9]. The proteolytic property of MMP9 may result in tissue damage by attacking the basal
lamina and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, as part of
the neuroinflammatory response, MMP-9 may also lead to
vasogenic or cytotoxic edema, hemorrhagic transformation,
and neuronal apoptosis [10]. However, recently, MMP-9
has been implicated in tissue repair such as extracellular
matrix remodeling, axonal regeneration, remyelination,
and the facilitation of neurogenesis and angiogenesis[11-14].
These beneficial roles of MMP-9 may be helpful in treating

Another study reported that MMP-9 plays key roles in
the formation of vascular networks after focal cerebral
ischemia[18]. These lines of evidence suggest that strategies
to modulate MMP-9 expression at different stages are
needed to promote post-stroke recovery. We hypothesized
that lentivirus-mediated MMP-9 gene therapy may provide
a useful approach for stroke treatment in the sub-acute
phase, but uncontrolled MMP-9 expression may induce
BBB disruption and brain hemorrhage[15, 16, 19]. Therefore, the
