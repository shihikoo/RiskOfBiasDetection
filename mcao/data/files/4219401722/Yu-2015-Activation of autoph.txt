Abstract. The present study aimed to investigate the activation of Atg1/pULK, and LC3 in the cerebral cortex following
focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CIR) injury, thereby
examining its effect on autophagy in brain cells. Rat CIR
models were established using the technique of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neurological function score, TTC
staining and the water content of brain tissue were used to
evaluate the CIR model. Levels of autophagy in the brain
cells were examined at different time‑points following CIR
damage using electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry
and western blot analysis were also used for the qualitative
and quantitative detection of levels of Atg1/pULK and LC3
in the cerebral cortex. Autophagy was observed in the early
stage of CIR, and the expression of Atg1/pULK and LC3
were observed 1 h following CIR in the rats and reached peak
expression levels after12 h, which following which the they
gradually decreased. These results suggested Atg1/pULK
and LC3 are key in the regulation of autophagy following
CIR in the rat brain.
Introduction
Strokes are characterized by significant rates of mortality and
disability (1), and there is increasing interest in elucidating
the underlying pathological mechanisms and identifying
potential treatment strategies. Previous clinical studies
have suggested several effective interventions to improve
prognosis (2‑4). Following ischemic stroke, the restoration
of blood flow is key to tissue repair and functional recovery,
however, reperfusion following a period of ischemia may

result in cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion (CIR) injury. During
ischemic injury, several pathological processes are involved,
including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and
necrotic and apoptotic cell death (5).
The fate of neuronal cells following ischemic stroke is
determined by the balance between cell survival and death.
Autophagy is regarded as one cell survival mechanism
and can be induced by various stress conditions, including
oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Following
cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, enhanced autophagy
has been demonstrated (6,7). In different circumstances,
autophagy can either prompt cell survival or enhance cell
death (8,9). Studies have also indicated that knockdown of
Beclin‑1 or LC3 significantly suppresses autophagy and
enhances cell apoptosis (10,11).
Enhanced autophagy has been identified in cerebral ischemia injury, including global and focal ischemia (12). Following
focal CIR, the protein levels of Beclin 1 and LC3 have been
found to be significantly upregulated in the post‑ischemic
brain tissues of rats (13). Transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) has been observed to significantly upregulate the numbers of cathepsin D, LAMP1‑positive neurons in
neonatal rats. In addition, marked punctuate autophagosomal
labeling (LC3) and marked lysosomal labeling (cathespin D
and LAMP1) are found in the neurons (14). The protein level of
cathepsin B is also significantly increased. These results indicate that autophagy is important in neuronal death following
focal CIR.
The role of autophagy remains controversial, however
increasing studies have indicated consistent autophagy activation following CIR (15,16). The present study aimed to
examine the correlation between the expression of Atg1/pULK
and LC3 in the cerebral cortex and focal CIR injury, thereby
investigating the effect of CIR on autophagy in brain cells.
Materials and methods
Animals. A total of 8 adult male Sprague‑Dawley rats
(220‑230 g), provided by the Animal Facility, Health Science
Center of Peking University (Beijing, China), were housed
in two laboratory animal cages and maintained at 25±1˚C
with 65±5% humidity on a 12‑h light/dark cycle (lights

on between 07:30 and 19:30) for at least 1 week prior to
experiments. The animals were provided with food and water
ad libitum. All experimental procedures used in the present
study were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for
Animal Experimentation of Liaoning Medical University
(Jinzhou, China).
Transient MCAO. The rats were subjected to transient focal
cerebral ischemia, induced by right MCAO, as previously
described (17), with certain modifications. In brief, the rats
were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, intraperitioneal), and arterial blood samples, obtained via a femoral
catheter, were collected to measure the pO2, pCO2 and pH using
an AVL 998 Blood Gas Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland). The rectal temperature of the rats was maintained at 37±0.5˚C during MCAO via a temperature‑regulated
heating lamp. A fiber‑optic probe was attached to the parietal
bone overlying the MCA territory, 5 mm posterior and 5 mm
lateral to the bregma, and was connected to a laser‑Doppler
flowmeter (PeriFlux System 5000; Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden) for continuous monitoring of the cerebral blood flow
(CBF). A 40 nylon monofilament suture with a heat‑blunted
tip was introduced into the internal carotid artery through
the stump of the external carotid artery and gently advanced
for a distance of 18 mm from the common carotid artery
bifurcation to block the origin of the MCA for 90 min, which
was then withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Only animals that
exhibited a reduction in CBF of >85% during right MCAO,
and a CBF recovery of >80% following 10 min of reperfusion were included in the present study. Sham‑operated rats
underwent the same surgery, however the suture was not
inserted. Following closure of the wound, the animals were
allowed to recover from anesthesia prior to being returned to
their original housing.
Assessment of neurological deficit score and analysis of
survival rates. The neurological deficit score was assessed
prior to sacrifice of the rats 24 h after reperfusion, as described
previously (18). Each rat was scored by two examiners in a
blinded‑manner. The following neurological deficit scoring
system was used: 0, no motor deficits (normal); 1, forelimb
weakness and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held
by tail (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side but normal
posture at rest (moderate); 3, unable to bear weight on the
affected side at rest (severe); and 4, no spontaneous locomotor
activity or barrel rolling (critical). If no deficit was observed
following 2 h recovery post‑anesthesia, the animal was
excluded from further investigation.
Edema measurement. A total of 8 rats were sacrificed
by decapitation, under deep anesthesia with 10% chloral
hydrate, at 6, 12, 24 and 72 h of reperfusion. The ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres were dissected and the wet
weight of the tissues were determined. The tissues were then
dried at 120˚C for 24 h and the percentage of cerebral water
was determined as follows: (wet weight ‑ dry weight) / dry
weight x 100.
Measurement of infarct volume. Following reperfusion, the
rats were anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate and then

sacrificed by decapitation, following which the whole brains
were rapidly removed. Coronal sections (n=10 for each
group) were cut into 2 mm slices and stained with standard
2% 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma‑Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 37˚C followed by overnight
immersion in 4% formalin. The infarct volume, expressed
as a percentage of whole‑brain volume, was measured using
an image processing and analysis system (Q570IW; 1.25X
objective; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and
was calculated by integration of the infarct area on each brain
section along the rostralcaudal axis.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining.
The rats were sacrificed 24 and 72 h after MCAO with an
overdose of 3.5% chloral hydrate, and were transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution followed by 4%
ice‑cold phosphate‑buffered paraformaldehyde. The brains
were then removed, postfixed overnight and equilibrated in
phosphate‑buffered 30% sucrose. Coronal sections between
1 and 2 mm from the bregma were used, which were cut
using a cryostate (Leica CM3000; Leica Microsystems
GmbH) at a thickness of 25 mm and used for immunohistochemical staining.
The sections were preserved in liquid nitrogen for
1 week then double‑stained by phenotypic markers, using
the following primary antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal
anti‑autophagy LC3 antibody (cat. no. AP1802a; 1:100;
Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA) and rabbit poly‑clonal
anti‑Beclin‑1 antibody (cat. no. AJ1087a; 1:100; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) to label autophagy. The
neuronal nuclei (NeuN) neuronal marker, rabbit monoclonal
(cat. no. EPR12763; 1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), was used
as the internal control. The following secondary antibodies
were used: Anti‑rabbit and mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)
G‑fluorescein isothiocyanate and IgG‑Cy3 (1:200; Chemicon,
Temecula, CA, USA).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM was used to
evaluate ultrastructural changes in the brain sections. Cerebral
fragments were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution overnight at 4˚C; and were then washed with phosphate‑buffered
saline and fixed with 1% osmic acid for 2 h at room temperature. The tissues were embedded in an epon/araldite mixture
(Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and
ultra‑thin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate
(Syntechem Co., Ltd., Changzhou, China) and lead citrate
(Xiamen Xingxiang Industrial Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China).
The samples were observed under a 1230 type TEM (Japan
Electron Optics Laboratory Company, Tokyo, Japan) and
images were captured.
Protein extraction, western blotting and antibodies. Cellular
proteins were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer, containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM
NaCl 1% (v/v) NP‑40 and 0.1% (w/v) SDS (Beijing Solarbio
Science and Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China), containing
1% (v/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Beijing Solarbio
Science and Technology Co., Ltd.), 0.3% (v/v) protease
inhibitor (Sigma‑Aldrich) and 0.1% (v/v) phosphorylated
proteinase inhibitor (Sigma‑Aldrich). The lysates were centri-

fuged at 11,000 x g at 4˚C for 15 min and the supernatant
was collected to determine the total protein concentration. A
bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology,
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) was used to determine the protein
concentration. Equal quantities of protein (15 µg) were
separated on an SDS‑PAGE gel (10%; v/v) and transferred
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany). Nonspecific binding was blocked
using 8% (w/v) milk in tris‑buffered saline and Tween 20
(TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were
then incubated with primary antibodies against β‑Actin
(D6A8) (rabbit monoclonal ; cat. no. 8457; 1:5,000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), ULK1 (D8H5;
rabbit monoclonal; cat. no. 8054; 1:1,000, Cell Signaling
Technology), Phospho‑ULK1 (Ser555; D1H4; rabbit mono-

clonal; cat. no. 5869; 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology),
and rabbit polyclonal anti‑autophagy LC3 antibody (1:1,000;
Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA) overnight at 4˚C. Following
four washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with
horserasish‑peroxidase (HRP)‑conjugated goat anti‑rabbit
and anti‑mouse IgG or HRP‑conjugated mouse anti‑goat
IgG (all 1:5,000; Abmart) for 2 h at room temperature and
then washed four times. The target proteins were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore Billerica,
MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and
quantified using density analysis normalized against β‑actin,
according to the manufacturer's instructions, expressed as
the fold‑change compared with the control.
Data quantification and statistical analyses. All data are
presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was analyzed using a one‑way analysis of variance,
followed by Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. The t‑test
was used for comparing the band density values between
the groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.
Results
Evaluation of the CIR model in rats. Transient focal ischemia
for 2 h caused infarction in the striatum and frontoparietal
cortex (Fig. 1A). In addition to the cerebral infarction, 2 h
cerebral ischemia also induced severe neurological deficits,
compared with the sham‑operated rats (Fig. 1B). As shown in
Fig. 1C, brain edema was significantly aggregated post‑reperfusion. In addition, the water content of the ischemic brain
tissues was significantly increased 60 min post‑reperfusion
(P<0.05; Fig. 1C).
Involvement of neuronal autophagy following CIR injury. To
evaluate the involvement of neuronal autophagy following
CIR injury TEM was used to examine morphological
changes in the neurons 60 min following CIR injury. The
cortical neurons from the sham‑operated control mice
maintained a normal appearance of the nuclei, rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and
lysosomes. By contrast, the cortical neurons subjected to
CIR exhibited an increase in the number of autophagosomes
and autolysosomes. The APs were identified as bubble‑like
vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2).

Enhanced protein levels of Atg1, pUL and LC3 following CIR
injury. To examine the effect of CIR on autophagy in the brain
cells, the levels of autophagy‑associated proteins were determined using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic form LC3
(LC3‑I) is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Through
modification and conjugation to a phosphatidylethanolamine,
the lipidated form (LC3‑II) can be attached to the autophagosome membrane during the activation of autophagy, which is a
widely accepted marker of autophagy. Atg1/pULK is involved
predominantly in the induction of autophagy, and its activity
is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of LC3‑II in the ischemic
cortex increased significantly between 1 and 24 h following
reperfusion, with a maximal induction at 12 h. The levels of
Atg1/pULK were also significantly upregulated and peaked
at 12 h.
Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine LC3 at
6 and 12 h post‑reperfusion. In the sham‑operated animals,
the cortical cells exhibited diffuse and weak staining for LC3
in the cytosol. Following I/R, intense LC3 staining appeared
granular in the cytosol of the cortical cells. Double staining for
LC3 and the neuronal nuclei (NeuN) neuronal marker demonstrated increased in LC3 punctate labeling in the cortical
neurons, particularly at 12 h (Fig. 4A). Following I/R, the
expression of Atg1 increased progressively in size and irregularity (Fig. 4B). Double staining for Atg1 and NeuN revealed
that the increased expression of Atg1 occurred predominantly
in neurons 12 h post‑reperfusion.
Discussion
The present study provided evidence that autophagy was
significantly induced following IR following MCAO in rats.
Furthermore, enhanced autophagy was often accompanied
by the upregulation of autophagy‑associated proteins,
including Atg1/pULK and LC3‑II in ischemic stroke. These
results indicated that autophagy can be markedly induced, in
part, by increasing the expression of autophagy‑associated
proteins.
Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is caused by a blood
supply disorder, which is often accompanied by neurologic
deficits. Ischemic cerebral vascular diseases account for >60%
of the incidence rate of total cerebral vascular diseases (19).
According to statistics, ischemic cerebrovascular disease
significantly affects human health and quality of life.
Therefore, the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebral
vascular disease has become an important topic and has
received extensive attention. At present, the predominant treatment of ischemic cerebral vascular disease is to improve blood
circulation and remove blood stasis. However, following the
restoration of blood supply, the symptoms of certain patients
are aggravated, as CIR.
Previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy is
important in CIR, however, the mechanism remains to be
fully elucidated (6,7,20,21). In the process of autophagy, cytoplasmic components are incorporated into double‑membrane
vesicles, termed autophagosomes, which can be hydrolyzed
by lysosomal hydrolases (22). Autophagy formation can be
divided into four stages, which include induction, start, extension and maturity (23). Atg1/pULK is predominantly involved

in the induction of autophagy, and its activity is regulated by
mTOR (24). Atg6/Belcin 1 is predominantly involved in the
initial stage of autophagy. The Vsp34 catalytic subunit of
phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase combines with the conserved
domain of Atg6/Belcin 1. Autophagy‑associated proteins,
including Atg21 and Atg24 can then bind to the membrane
and form a pre‑autophagosomal structure (PAS) (25). In
the extension stage, several Atg cytokines are involved

in autophagy (26,27). Atg12, Atg5 and Atg16 can form
complexes and bind to the PAS; however, Atg8/LC3 is covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine, together with
Atg7 and Atg3, which then binds to the plasma membrane
and is involved in PAS extension. Finally, autophagosomes,
namely the autophagic lysosome, can form and, under the
action of autophagosomes, the membranes and inclusions can
be degraded.

At present, the investigation of autophagy in the model
of focal CIR model has been limited to the initial stage
of autophagy (Belcin 1). However, the initial and elongation stages have received less attention. The present study
focussed predominantly on the regulation factors of these
two stages, including Atg1/pULK and LC3. The results of the
present study demonstrated significant autophagy initiation
1 h post‑CIR. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, Atg1/pULK were
significantly upregulated 1 h post‑reperfusion, which peaked
at 12 h. In addition, autophagosome formation was also identified 12 h post‑reperfusion, with an increase in the number
of autophagosomes and autolysosomes observed under
TEM. The protein level of LC3‑II was also upregulated,
suggesting the involvement of autophagy in the cerebral
injury post reperfusion.

In conclusion, the present study investigated the expression
levels of Atg1/pULK and LC3 in CIR rats, and demonstrated
that Atg1/pULK and LC3 were expressed 1 h post‑CIR in the
rats and reached peak expression at 12 h, prior to subsequent
gradual decrease. These results suggested that Atg1/pULK and
LC3 are important in the regulation of autophagy following
CIR in the rat brain. These data may be useful to further elucidate the mechanism underlying autophagy, thereby providing
experimental evidence for the prevention and treatment of
CIR.
