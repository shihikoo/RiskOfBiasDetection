Physical exercise is beneﬁcial to functional recovery after stroke. But its underling mechanism is still
unknown. It is reported that neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, migration and differentiation play
an important role in recovery following stroke, furthermore, stromal cell derived factor-1␣ (SDF-1␣)
and its chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) regulate NSCs migration. This study is aimed to examine
whether physical exercise improves functional recovery by enhancing NSCs proliferation, migration and
differentiation through SDF-1␣/CXCR4 axis in rats after ischemic stroke. Rats that sustained transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with physical exercise after MCAO. AMD3100 (an
antagonist of CXCR4) was used to conﬁrm the effect of SDF-1␣/CXCR4 axis on exercise-mediated NSCs
mobilization. We found that physical exercise improved functional recovery and reduced infarct volume.
Moreover, 5-bromo-2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (Dcx)-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ and
BrdU/neuron-speciﬁc nuclear protein (NeuN)-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum were increased
by physical exercise. Simultaneously, SDF-1␣-positive cells were signiﬁcantly higher in physical exercise group than those in control group. Our results indicate that physical exercise improves functional
recovery in ischemic rats possibly by enhancement of NSCs proliferation, migration in the SVZ and differentiation in the damaged striatum. Moreover, SDF-1␣/CXCR4 pathway involves in exercise-mediated
NSCs proliferation and migration but not differentiation.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of neurological disability, and about 70%
stroke survivors remain impaired. Recent studies have indicated
that endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) have potential to improve
neurological function after stroke [1]. Adult brain NSCs locate in the
two discrete regions: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral

ventricle and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate
gyrus [2]. It is reported that stroke activates dormant endogenous
NSCs to promote SVZ-derived neuroblasts proliferation and migration to the damaged region where these neuroblasts differentiate
into mature neurons to replenish damaged neurons [3–5]. However, this is not sufﬁcient for neural repair after stroke [3].
Previously, we and others have demonstrated that physical
exercise can improve functional recovery by enhancing neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region after stroke [6,7]. However, whether
physical exercise induces SVZ-derived NSCs proliferation, migration and differentiation after ischemic stroke remains ambiguous.
Recent studies indicate that SDF-1␣/CXCR4 axis plays an important
role in enhancing neural progenitor cells migration from the SVZ
toward the damaged striatum to repair the damage after ischemic

stroke [8,9]. In addition, blockage of SDF-1␣/CXCR4 signaling with
ADM3100, an antagonist of CXCR4, attenuates neuroblasts migration [10]. Hence, SDF-1␣/CXCR4 axis may be an ideal candidate to
regulate exercise-induced NSCs proliferation, migration and differentiation. In this study, we use a rat model of ischemic stroke to
assess the role of SDF-1␣/CXCR4 axis in exercise-mediated NSCs
proliferation, migration and differentiation from the SVZ to the
damaged striatum.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal model and functional assessment
A total of 117 male Wistar rats (200–240 g) were obtained from
Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou
Province, China). All experimental procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee Sun Yat-sen University and were conducted according to the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animal of the National Institute of Health
(Publication No. 80-23, revised 1996). Rats were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia induced by left transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) as mentioned previously [11]. Brieﬂy, rats
were anesthetized with an intra-peritoneal injection of 3.5% chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg). The left common carotid artery (CCA), internal
carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA) were surgically exposed. A ﬁlament (4–0 nylon suture with a rounded tip) was
inserted into the ICA to block the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at its
origin. Body temperature of the rats was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C
on a heating pad. The suture was pulled back until the tip reached
around the ICA to restore blood ﬂow (reperfusion) after 90 min of
MCAO.
Functional outcome was evaluated using modiﬁed neurological severity score (MNSS) performing at 2, 7, 14 and 21 days after
MCAO as described earlier [12–14]. The rats were evaluated by four
tests: motor, sensory, balance and reﬂex tests, then all test scores
were added into the MNSS value. MNSS was assessed on a scale of
0–18 (normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score, 18). Mild neurological
dysfunction was deﬁned as a score of 1–6, moderate neurological
dysfunction as a score of 7–12 and severe neurological dysfunction
as a score of 13–18. Rats were tested three times by an individual blinded to grouping, and the average was recorded. The rats
with scores 7–12 at 2 days after MCAO were then selected and
randomly assigned into ﬁve groups: the physical exercise group
(E, n = 27) and the physical exercise group treated with AMD3100
(EA, n = 27), which was injected with a blocker of CXCR4. Both of
these two groups were subjected to a running exercise daily at 3
days after MCAO. The control group (C, n = 27), the control group
treated with AMD3100 (CA, n = 27) and sham-operated group (S,
n = 9), which were fed in standard cages without any special training exercise. The ﬁve groups were further randomized into three
subgroups with different time point: 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO.
SPSS 13.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to do
the randomization.

2.2. Exercise training
All animals subjected to exercise were placed into a programmable, motorized wheel apparatus (21 cm diameter, 40 cm
length, made in China). Rats in E and EA groups were put into it
to run at 3 days post-ischemia. At the beginning, the running speed
was set at 5 rev/min (about 3 m/min), for 20 min twice a day, then
gradually increased to 10 rev/min (about 6 m/min) on the seventh
day, 15 rev/min (about 10 m/min) on the fourteenth day until the
twenty-ﬁrst days after MCAO. This exercise program was designed

based on our previous studies [6,12]. The C, CA and S groups were
housed in a standard cage with no special exercise training.
2.3. Bromodeoxyuridine cell labeling and AMD3100 injection
Daily injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg;
Sigma–Aldrich, USA) were given intraperitoneally for every group
at 1 day after the MCAO, to label dividing cells until sacriﬁced.
AMD3100 is a small molecule that reversibly and selectively
blocks binding of stromal cell derived factor-1␣ (SDF-1␣) to its
chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) [15]. Rats in EA and CA group
were injected with AMD3100 (2.0 mg/kg; Abcam, USA) intraperitoneally every other day at 2 days after MCAO until sacriﬁce.
2.4. TTC staining
TTC staining was used to evaluate the infarct volume of rats
in each group (n = 3) at 2, 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO. The brain
from bregma +4.0 to −6.0 mm was cut into ﬁve consecutive coronal
sections with 2 mm thickness. 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C followed
by overnight immersion in 4% formaldehyde solution. The infarct
volumes were calculated with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). The volumes of
the infarct and the contralateral hemisphere were calculated as previously described [16], and relative infarct volume was expressed
as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1A and C).
2.5. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Immunoﬂuorescence staining is carried out according to the
procedure previously described with a minor modiﬁcation [17].
Rats in each group (n = 6) were sacriﬁced with an overdose of
10% chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline
at 4 ◦ C. The brains ﬁxed in the above ﬁxative for 8 h at 4 ◦ C, and
then immersed sequentially in 20% and 30% sucrose until sinking
occurred. Coronal sections (10-␮m thick) were cut on a cryostat (CM1900; Leica, Heidelberger, Germany) from bregma 1.00 to
−0.40 mm.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining steps were performed as following: for BrdU immunostaining, brain sections were incubated in 2 N
HCl at 37 ◦ C for 30 min, sections were washed in 0.1 M borate solution (pH 8.5) twice for 10 min, incubated in 3% H2 O2 for 30 min, and
blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature.
Then, sections were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with mixtures of rat
anti-BrdU (1:200; Abcam) and guinea pig anti-doublecortin (Dcx)
(1:1000; Millipore, USA) or mouse anti-neuron-speciﬁc nuclear
protein (NeuN) (1:200; Millipore), rabbit anti-SDF-1␣ (1:200;
Abcam) and guinea pig anti-Dcx or mouse anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) (1:200; Millipore). At the next day, sections were
incubated with secondary antibody: peroxidase-marked mouse
anti-rat/rabbit IgG (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), goat
anti-guinea pig IgG-FITC (1:200; Santa Cruz, USA), for 1 h at 37 ◦ C.
After rinsing, sections were mounted in a ﬂuorescent mounting
medium: Fluorshield with DAPI (Sigma–Aldrich). Negative control
sections were incubated with PBS instead of primary antibodies and
showed no positive signals ﬂuorescent mounting medium signals
were observed with a microscope (BX51; Olympus). The positive
cells were counted by Image-Pro Plus image analysis software in 4
non-overlapping ﬁelds (425 ␮m × 320 ␮m) under 400× magniﬁcations.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Numerical data were presented as mean ± SD. Repeated measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate

MNSS variables. Comparisons of multiple groups were carried out
using ANOVA followed by Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference test
of infarct volume values and the number of BrdU/Dcx/NeuN/SDF1␣/GFAP-positive cell variables. Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS 13.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Functional assessment
The MNSS values were zero in S group at each time point. There
was no signiﬁcant difference in MNSS values among the four groups
at 2 days after MCAO (P > 0.05). Compared with C and CA groups,
E group exhibited a more signiﬁcant improvement in the MNSS
scale at 7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO (P < 0.05), and rats in E group
also showed signiﬁcant decline in the MNSS values compared with
those in EA group at 14 and 21 days after MCAO (P < 0.05, Fig. 1B).
3.2. Infarct volume
The infarct volume was zero in S group at each time point. There
was no signiﬁcant difference of the relative infarct volumes among
the four groups at 2 days after MCAO (P > 0.05, Fig. 1A and C). The
basal level of relative infarct volumes was 53.9 ± 1.34% at 2 days
after MCAO. At 7 days after MCAO, the relative infarct volumes
were 33.43 ± 0.56%, 37.33 ± 1.56%, 35.6 ± 1.42% and 38.9 ± 1.94% in

the E, EA, C and CA groups, respectively. At 14 days after MCAO,
the relative infarct volumes were 21.64 ± 1.47%, 32.78 ± 2.70%,
27.23 ± 2.6% and 33.93 ± 1.00% in the E, EA, C and CA groups, respectively. At 21 days after MCAO, the relative infarct volumes were
15.56 ± 1.31%, 23.57 ± 2.47%, 21.38 ± 2.16% and 27.92 ± 1.65% in the
E, EA, C and CA groups, respectively. Compared with C group, physical exercise signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volumes at each time
point after MCAO (P < 0.05). Compared with EA group, the infarct
volumes were signiﬁcantly reduced in E group at 14 and 21 days
after MCAO (P < 0.001, Fig. 1C).

3.3. NSCs proliferation and migration in the SVZ
BrdU-positive cells peaked in the ipsilateral SVZ at 7 days after
MCAO. The number of BrdU-positive cells in E group signiﬁcantly
increased at 14 (P < 0.001) and 21 (P < 0.001) days after MCAO compared with those in other groups. Compared with CA group, C group
showed a signiﬁcant increase of BrdU-positive cells at 7, 14 and
21 days after MCAO (P < 0.05). However, BrdU-positive cells in E
group were not better than EA group at 7 days after MCAO (P > 0.05,
Fig. 2B).
Dcx-immunopositive cells were evident at 7 days after MCAO
and obvious in the ipsilateral SVZ, callosum and striatum region.
Compared with EA, C and CA groups, E group increased the expression of Dcx-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ at each time
point (P < 0.001). And Dcx-positive cells in C group showed a

signiﬁcant increase compared with those in CA group at each time
point (P < 0.05, Fig. 2B).
To observe the expression of newborn immature neuroblasts
in the SVZ, we performed double immunoﬂuorescence labeling of
BrdU and Dcx. The result showed that BrdU/Dcx double-positive
cells were signiﬁcantly higher at each time point in E groups than
in EA, C, and CA groups (P < 0.001, Fig. 2B). In contrast, BrdU or Dcximmunostaining in the contralateral SVZ and S group showed little
expression, suggesting that BrdU/Dcx expression may be triggered
by ischemia.
3.4. NSCs differentiation in the ipsilateral striatum
Dcx-immunopositive cells peaked in the ipsilateral striatum at
14 days after MCAO. E group increased the expression of Dcxpositive cells at 14 and 21 days after MCAO, compared with EA,
C and CA groups (P < 0.05, Fig. 3A and D). BrdU and Dcx doublepositive cells peaked at 14 days after MCAO and were signiﬁcantly
higher at 14 (P < 0.001) and 21 days (P < 0.05) but not at 7 days
(P > 0.05) after MCAO in E groups than those in EA, C, and CA groups
(Fig. 3B and D). To determine whether NSCs differentiated into
mature neurons in the ipsilateral striatum where they were needed
for brain damage repair, NeuN and BrdU were double-stained at
7, 14 and 21 days after MCAO. At 21 days after MCAO, rats in E
group showed a signiﬁcant increase of BrdU/NeuN double-positive
cells in the ipsilateral striatum than those in C and CA groups
(P < 0.001, Fig. 3B and D). However, less than 5% BrdU-positive cells

showed co-localization with NeuN in every group. The proportion
of BrdU and Dcx/GFAP-double positive cells to the total number of
BrdU-positive cells was higher in E group compared with C group
(P < 0.05).
3.5. The expression of SDF-1˛ in the ipsilateral striatum
SDF-1␣-immunopositive cells peaked at 14 days after MCAO.
The expression of SDF-1␣-positive cells was increased at each time
point in E group compared with C group (P < 0.05, Fig. 1D). There is
no signiﬁcant difference noted in the number of SDF-1␣-positive
cells between E and EA/C and CA groups at each time point (P > 0.05,
Fig. 1D). Two morphological types of SDF-1␣-positive cell were
shown: one with multipolar processes resembling astrocytes and
the other with bipolar processes also positive for Dcx (Fig. 3C).
Notably, double staining showed that 33.67% of SDF-1␣-positive
cells were also co-stained with Dcx, and 68.73% of SDF-1␣-positive
cells were also co-stained with GFAP. The numbers of SDF-1␣/Dcx
double-positive cells were signiﬁcantly increased in E group than
that in C group (P < 0.05, data not shown).
4. Discussion
In the present study, we found that physical exercise improved
neurological function and reduced infarct volume possibly by
enhancing NSCs proliferation, migration and differentiation from
the ipsilateral SVZ to the damaged striatum in rats with ischemic

stroke. We also observed that physical exercise elevated the
expression of SDF-1␣-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum. Furthermore, the interaction of chemokine SDF-1␣ with its receptor
CXCR4 was identiﬁed to play a signiﬁcant role in exercise-mediated
NSCs proliferation and migration in rats after ischemic stroke.
Previous studies have reported that NSCs generated from the
SVZ migrate toward the peri-infarct region, and differentiate
into neural cells possibly improving neurological function after
ischemic stroke [17]. Thus, increasing NSCs proliferation, migration and differentiation from the SVZ to the lesioned sites has been
considered as one of the most signiﬁcant strategies after stroke
[18]. Physical activity has been reported to promote NSCs proliferation, survival and maturation of newborn neurons within the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus [19]. Consistently, we found
that compared with control group, physical exercise enhanced the
expression of BrdU and Dcx-positive cells in the SVZ at each time
point after MCAO, suggesting that SVZ also retains a population of
NSCs that can be activated by physical exercise following stroke.
These results are consistent with some previous reports [20,21].
Furthermore, we observed that physical exercise increased the
number of newborn immature neurons (BrdU/Dcx) at 7, 14, 21
days after MCAO and mature neurons (BrdU/NeuN) at 21 days after
MCAO in the ipsilateral striatum, suggesting that NSCs differentiation in the peri-infarct region can be improved by physical exercise.
However, less than 5% BrdU-positive cells show co-localization

with NeuN in the lesioned sites, indicating that neural progenitors may differentiate into the non-neuronal lineages cells in the
striatum, such as astrocytes, which also maybe a reason for functional recovery [20]. There is also a limitation. In order to label NSCs
proliferation, daily injection of BrdU was performed for 21 days.
Due to its potential toxic effect to the dividing cells, the length of
injections should be minimized in the future. Nevertheless, these
ﬁndings suggest that physical exercise produces beneﬁcial effects
on neurological function are associated with enhancement of NSCs
proliferation, migration and differentiation after stroke.
The role of chemokine SDF-1␣ and its receptor CXCR4 are well
established in neuronal migration in the developing brain [22] as
well as in pathological conditions [9]. SDF-1␣ secreted by activating astrocytes and endothelial cells in the ischemic boundary
region attracts neuroblasts expressing CXCR4 in the SVZ toward
the boundary [23]. Consistently, we found that physical exercise
signiﬁcantly increased the number of SDF-1␣-positive cells in parallel to the enhanced Dcx-positive cells from the ipsilateral SVZ to
striatum after ischemic stroke. These results suggested that there is
a direct link between physical exercise and SDF-1␣/CXCR4 induced
NSCs migration. Furthermore, we also found that SDF-1␣/CXCR4
involved in neural cell proliferation, because CXCR4 antagonist
AMD3100 decreased BrdU-positive cells both in the SVZ and the
damaged striatum. However, the antagonist cannot decline the
number of BrdU and NeuN double-positive cells, indicating that

208

the pathway may not participate in exercise-mediated NSCs differentiation into newborn mature neurons in rats after ischemic
stroke, which could be an important avenue of future research.
Recently, it has been indicated that neuroblasts migrating from the
SVZ may participate in functional recovery in the chronic phase
of ischemic stroke [24]. Consistently, in our study, injection of
AMD3100 during exercise inhibited functional recovery at 14 and
21 days not 2 or 7 days after MCAO. This may attributed to AMD3100
attenuated the exercise-mediated NSCs proliferation and migration
in the SVZ at 14 and 21 days after MCAO. Besides, it also decreased
the newborn immature neurons elevated by exercise in the ipsilateral striatum at 14 and 21 days after MCAO, thereby signiﬁcantly
suppressing functional recovery in the chronic phase of ischemic
stroke. Moreover, CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 can suppress acute
inﬂammatory response and reduced blood–brain barrier disruption
at the acute time after MCAO [25]. This may be one of the reasons
that treatment with AMD3100 did not inhibit functional recovery at
2 and 7 days after MCAO. In the course of time, AMD3100 showed
remarkable ability to inhibit NSCs recruitments. Therefore, SDF1␣/CXCR4 signaling regulates the proliferation and migration of
endogenous NSCs enhanced by physical exercise from the ipsilateral SVZ toward the ischemic area.
5. Conclusions
In summary, our ﬁndings suggest that physical exercise
improves functional recovery in rats after ischemic stroke possibly
by enhancement of NSCs proliferation, migration in the SVZ and
differentiation in the damaged striatum. Moreover, SDF-1␣/CXCR4
pathway involves in exercise-mediated NSCs proliferation and
migration but not differentiation.
