ABSTRACT
Objectives Clinical evidence suggests that neurological
lesions can protect from arthritis. Acute cerebral
ischaemia induces severe immunosuppression, resulting
in enhanced susceptibility to infections. We aimed to
determine if stroke-induced immunosuppression can
ameliorate arthritis and to delineate the immunological
mechanisms involved.
Methods Unilateral cerebral ischaemia was induced in
mice by occlusion of one middle cerebral artery (MCAO) at
different time points after induction of G6PI-induced
arthritis in mice. Clinical and histological signs of arthritis
were assessed. Regulatory T cells were speciﬁcally
depleted by injection of diphtheria toxin into transgenic
DEREG mice. Immunological correlates of MCAO were
determined by ﬂow cytometry and serological methods.
Results MCAO reduced the clinical and histological
signs of arthritis signiﬁcantly. To be effective, stroke had
to be induced during the induction phase or the early
clinical stage of arthritis. MCAO induced a global loss of
leucocytes. Despite the reduced absolute number of
lymphocytes, the functional differentiation of T helper
cells into Th1/17 cells and the production of
autoantibodies were unimpaired. Depletion experiments
showed that regulatory T cells were dispensable for the
protective effect of MCAO.
Conclusions MCAO ameliorates arthritis. The correlate
of protection from arthritis is not the reduction of a
particular pathogenic leucocyte subset or the preferential
expansion or emergence of a protective cell population
but the global reduction of leucocytes during arthritis.

The immune system and the nervous system communicate continually.1 Neurotransmitters modulate
innate and adaptive immune responses while
cytokines modulate body temperature, mood and
sleep. Acute cerebral ischaemia induces severe
immunosuppression,2–6 resulting in enhanced
susceptibility to respiratory and urinary tract infections, which are the leading cause of death in stroke
patients.4 6–8 Stroke-induced tissue destruction and
disruption of the blood–brain barrier also result in
the release of CNS autoantigens and their presentation to T-lymphocytes under proinﬂammatory
immunogenic conditions.4 6 9 It has, therefore,
been suggested that stroke-induced immunosuppression protects from stroke-induced autoimmune
responses against CNS autoantigens.4 Autoimmune
responses are essential in the pathogenesis of
rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and

spondyloarthropathies.10 11 Clinical evidence suggests that ischaemic, traumatic or postinfectious
damage to the nervous system can protect from or
ameliorate arthritis.12–17 However, the underlying
mechanisms have remained enigmatic.
The aims of this study were to examine if
stroke-induced immunosuppression can ameliorate
arthritis and to delineate the immunological
mechanisms involved.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and induction of glucose-6-phosphate
isomerase-induced arthritis
DBA/1 and DBA/1 DEREG mice were bred and
underwent experiments at the animal facility of the
University Hospital Jena. All animal studies were
approved by the appropriate authorities (reg. No.
02-006/08). Arthritis was induced by subcutaneous
immunisation with 200 mg of recombinant human
G6PI in complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) and evaluated clinically as
described.18 Depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) was
performed in DBA/1 DEREG mice19 by intraperitoneal application of 0.5 mg of diphtheria toxin 48 and
24 h before and 4 and 5 d after G6PI immunisation.
This resulted in reliable transient depletion of Treg
cells (data not shown). For experiments analysing the
time point of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) performance on arthritis severity, DBA/1 or
non-depleted DBA/1 DEREG mice were used.

Histopathological assessment of
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-induced
arthritis
Haematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of ﬁxed and
decalciﬁed joints were evaluated by a pathologist.
Inﬂammation and cartilage and bone destruction
were graded as described before.20

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
MCAO was performed under isoﬂurane anaesthesia.
A nylon monoﬁlament coated with silicone
(Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) was introduced
into the common carotid artery and moved to the
origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to block
perfusion. The ﬁlament was left in this position for
60 min. In sham-operated animals, it was immediately withdrawn 4–5 mm to prevent brain ischaemia. After MCAO, mice were kept in heated cages,
and 3 d before surgery Enroﬂoxacin (25 mg/mL;
Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany) was
added to the drinking water.

Basic and translational research
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens and lymph
nodes (LN) (inguinal, axillary, paraaortic) and cultured in
medium alone or with 25 mg huG6PI or 2 mg plate-bound
anti-CD3 and 2 mg anti-CD28. Supernatants were harvested and
concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-17
were measured by sandwich ELISAs (eBiosciences, Frankfurt,
Germany) using recombinant cytokines (Peprotech, Hamburg,
Germany) as standard. G6PI-speciﬁc antibody serum concentrations were determined as previously described.21

Proliferation assay
Single-cell suspensions from draining LN were prepared 9 d
after immunisation and cultured with medium alone or 25 μg/
mL G6PI for 72 h. [3H]-thymidine (0.5 mCi/well; Hartmann
Analytic) per well was added for the last 18 h. Cells were harvested, and incorporation of radiolabelled thymidine was measured using a microplate scintillation luminescence counter
(Canberra-Packard, Rüsselsheim, Germany). The stimulation
index (SI) was calculated as described.22

Flow cytometric analysis of cell populations and cytokine
production
Single-cell suspensions from spleen and draining LN were prepared 9 d after immunisation and cultured with anti-CD16/32
(2.4G2) and rat IgG to prevent unspeciﬁc binding, followed by
ﬂuorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed against B220
(RA3-6B2), CD3, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, CD11b (all from eBioscience)
or CD11c (M1/70).
Analysis of G6PI-speciﬁc cytokine-producing T cells was performed after culturing for 6 h with 25 mg/mL G6PI or medium
alone as described.23–25 Data were acquired using a LSRII ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analysed
using FlowJo V.8.1.1 software (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon, USA).
Gates for CD154 were set using unstimulated control samples.

Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between groups were evaluated using the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test. Statistical signiﬁcance
was accepted for p values of less than 0.05 (*p<0.05;
**p<0.01; ***p<0.001). All calculations were performed using
the SPSS software V.16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Data are presented as arithmetic mean and SE of the mean.

RESULTS
MCAO-induced ischaemia
Temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO)
induced substantial necrosis in the parietal lobe supplied by this
vessel. Ischaemia was observable macroscopically in the left
hemisphere, whereas the contralateral hemisphere was not
affected (ﬁgure 1A). Histological sections revealed disbandment
of cortical structures in the ischaemic brain areas (ﬁgure 1B) and
extensive necrosis (ﬁgure 1C).

MCAO ameliorates arthritis
To evaluate the effects of stroke-induced immunosuppression at
different stages of arthritis pathogenesis, stroke was induced at
various time points after G6PI immunisation. MCAO 3 days
before G6PI immunisation (d-3) had no effect on incidence or
severity of arthritis (ﬁgure 2A). MCAO 3 days after immunisation with antigen in CFA resulted in an unacceptably high mortality rate (data not shown). In contrast, MCAO 6 days after
immunisation (d6) ameliorated the course of arthritis
2184

signiﬁcantly (ﬁgure 2B). MCAO 10 days after G6PI immunisation, when clinical signs of arthritis were already clearly visible,
also reduced arthritis severity (ﬁgure 2C). Stroke induction at
later time points (d12, d15) had only minor effects on arthritis
(data not shown). Thus, stroke ameliorates the clinical course of
arthritis when MCAO is performed in the induction phase or
during the early clinical stage of G6PI-induced arthritis.
Mice that had undergone MCAO or sham surgery 6 days
after G6PI immunisation were examined histopathologically
16 d after G6PI immunisation. Paws from animals with experimental stroke had diminished signs of acute and chronic inﬂammation. They also had less cartilage and bone destruction
compared with animals of the sham group, conﬁrming the clinical scoring (ﬁgure 2D).

MCAO induces a profound and prolonged loss of leucocytes
To determine the immunological correlates of protection, we
examined the effect of stroke on the number of leucocytes
within the secondary lymphoid organs. At day 16 after G6PI
immunisation (10 d after MCAO), when arthritis severity was
maximal in control mice, we found signiﬁcantly reduced cell
numbers in LN and spleens of MCAO mice (ﬁgure 3A). Flow
cytometric analyses revealed that the reduction of cell numbers
was not caused by the loss of a particular cell population. The
numbers of B220+ B cells, CD3+CD4+ T helper cells,
CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages
(CD11b+), dendritic cells (CD11c+) and neutrophil granulocytes (Gr-1+), were all reduced signiﬁcantly by 45–75% (ﬁgure
3B). Thus, amelioration of arthritis was associated with a
massive and prolonged global loss of leucocytes. Adoptive transfer of 107 unseparated cells from LN and spleens from
G6PI-immunised mice 2 days after MCAO did not reconstitute
disease development (data not shown).

MCAO does not affect autoantibody production
Autoantibodies against G6PI are necessary but not sufﬁcient for
induction of G6PI-induced arthritis.18 21 26 27 Sixteen days after
G6PI immunisation, titres of G6PI-speciﬁc IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b,
IgG3 and IgM antibodies were slightly but not signiﬁcantly
reduced in the MCAO group (ﬁgure 4A). Therefore,
stroke-induced dampening of the humoral immune response
does not explain the reduced arthritis severity in MCAO mice.

Cytokine production is similar in MCAO and control mice
Sixteen days after G6PI immunisation (10 d after MCAO), proliferation in response to G6PI was similar in cells from the
draining LN of MCAO or sham-operated mice (ﬁgure 4B).
Concentrations of IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ and TNF-α in the supernatants of LN cells were similar in both groups in response to
stimulation with G6PI or anti-CD3/CD28 (ﬁgure 4C).
Concentrations of IL-4 and IL-5 were near the detection limit in
both groups.

Functional differentiation of G6PI-speciﬁc Th cells is
unimpaired after MCAO
TNF-α, IL-17 and IFN-γ are key cytokines in the pathogenesis
of G6PI-induced arthritis.18 28 29 We analysed the G6PI-speciﬁc
Th cell cytokine production 10 d after immunisation in mice
that had undergone MCAO or sham surgery at d6 after G6PI
immunisation. The number of LN and spleen cells did not
differ between MCAO and sham animals at this time point
(ﬁgure 5A). We used polychromatic ﬂow cytometry to analyse
the functional differentiation of G6PI-speciﬁc Th cells 10 d
after immunisation. We found no difference in the numbers of

MCAO and sham mice (ﬁgure 5B). The numbers of IFN-γ,
TNF-α or IL-17-producing G6PI-speciﬁc T cells were also
similar in control and MCAO mice (ﬁgure 5C). Thus, differentiation towards a Th1 or Th17 phenotype was unimpaired following stroke.

Treg cells are dispensable for stroke-induced
immunosuppression
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells have been shown to be
relevant for the prevention and down-modulation of experimental arthritis.25 31–34 An increased frequency of Treg cells was
reported 4 days after experimental stroke.35 Moreover, Treg cells
have been claimed as major modulators of postischaemic inﬂammatory brain damage.36 We employed DEREG mice, in which
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells can be depleted by injecting diphtheria toxin,19 to examine the relevance of Treg cells for the
MCAO-induced amelioration of arthritis. Depletion of regulatory T cells resulted in enhanced severity and chronicity of
G6PI-induced arthritis (ﬁgure 6A), conﬁrming our earlier ﬁndings.25 MCAO reduced clinical arthritis in Treg-cell-depleted

DEREG mice signiﬁcantly compared with sham-operated mice.
Arthritis severity was signiﬁcantly reduced in both DBA/1
DEREG mice and non-transgenic littermates upon MCAO
without a difference between these groups. Treg cells and other
cells produce the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine TGF-β. Serum
concentrations of TGF-β can be modulated by the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS).37 We, therefore, examined TGF-β serum
concentrations 16 and 25 d after GPI immunisation. There was
no difference between mice that had undergone MCAO 6 d
after G6PI immunisation and sham-operated mice (data not
shown). Thus, stroke-induced immunosuppression protects from
arthritis even in the absence of Treg cells and independently of
increased TGF-β production.

MCAO does not induce increased numbers of regulatory
T cells in arthritic mice
We used green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) expression by Treg cells
in the DEREG mouse strain19 to determine the frequency of
Treg cells during the course of experimental arthritis. There was
no difference between MCAO and sham-operated animals.
Approximately 5% of CD4+ T cells were GFP+ Treg before

day 15. When acute arthritis was already resolving 25 d postimmunisation, the frequency of Treg cells was 9.9% in the MCAO
group and 12.7% in the sham group, respectively (ﬁgure 6B).
Therefore, the resolution of arthritis was associated with an
increase in Treg cells, but this increase was not further enhanced
by MCAO.

DISCUSSION
Stroke-induced immunosuppression is a major pathogenic factor
predisposing patients for morbidity and mortality through secondary infections, particularly pneumonia.2–4 6–8 Anecdotal
clinical evidence has suggested that stroke or denervation can
protect from arthritis.12–17 We show here that stroke-induced
immunosuppression modulates the pathogenic immune
responses that induce autoimmune arthritis.
The main ex vivo correlate of stroke-induced protection from
arthritis was a global reduction in leucocyte numbers. Reduced
lymphocyte numbers in secondary lymphatic organs5 6 7 35 39 40
and the peripheral blood39 are characteristics of stroke in
murine models. Several studies have demonstrated that this
lymphocyte loss was due to apoptosis.7 35 39 Offner et al35
reported a reduction in splenic cell yield already 22 h after
stroke. This differs from our ﬁndings: we did not ﬁnd
2186

dramatically reduced cell numbers in spleen and LN 4 d after
MCAO; instead we found a massive reduction in leucocyte
numbers 10 d after MCAO. Moreover, we found an approximately twofold reduction in spleen cell numbers, whereas
Offner et al35 reported an approximately ﬁvefold reduction.
These differences are explicable by several factors. First, we
induced MCAO 6 d after immunisation with G6PI in CFA, that
is, during an ongoing immune response when T-lymphocytes
and B-lymphocytes proliferated in the draining LN and spleen.
In contrast, Offner et al analysed unimmunised mice after
MCAO. The ongoing activation and proliferation is likely to
inﬂuence both the cells’ susceptibility to stroke-induced apoptosis and the time needed to replenish the lymphocyte pool.
Second, we studied DBA/1 mice, whereas Offner et al used
C57BL/6 mice. Mouse strains differ in their susceptibility to
stroke-induced immunosuppression.41 In addition to global
leucocyte numbers, we also analysed the antigen-speciﬁc
immune responses to G6PI, the autoantigen inciting the arthritogenic immune responses in G6PI-induced arthritis.18 30 There
are several novel aspects in the current study of stroke-induced
immunosuppression. B cell numbers were signiﬁcantly reduced
in mice in which arthritis was ameliorated after MCAO. In contrast, G6PI-speciﬁc antibody titres were not reduced in these

animals, reﬂecting the fact that most of the antibody production
had occurred prior to the stroke-induced B cell loss and conﬁrming our earlier ﬁndings that antibodies are not sufﬁcient to
induce G6PI-induced arthritis.18 21
Studies on stroke patients reported reduced numbers and
function of lymphocytes in the blood, whereas granulocyte
numbers were increased, unaltered or not reported.2 6–8 38
The published data on the inﬂuence of stroke on T-cell cytokine
production is contradictory. One study reported an initial hyperinﬂammatory reaction characterised by an increased production of

proinﬂammatory cytokines preceding the stroke-induced immunosuppression in mice.42 A Th1/Th2 shift following clinical43 or
experimental39 stroke was reported, whereas another study found
unimpaired production of TNF-α and IL-6 in T cells from stroke
patients.44 One possible explanation for these contradictory ﬁndings is that global ELISAs were used in those studies. Using ﬂow
cytometry, antigen-speciﬁc Th cells can be identiﬁed by their
expression of CD154 upon a brief ex vivo stimulation with their
cognate antigen.21 23–25 29 45–47 Ten days after immunisation with
G6PI, we found similar numbers of G6PI-speciﬁc CD4+CD154+

homeostasis by suppressing immune responses to self and
non-self antigens.48 An increased frequency of Treg cells has
been reported in patients for up to 3 weeks after stroke.49 Treg
cell frequencies were also increased in unimmunised mice 96 h

after MCAO.35 Due to the massive loss of lymphocytes, absolute
Treg cell numbers were nevertheless strongly decreased in
MCAO mice in that study.35 In contrast to these ﬁndings, we
did not ﬁnd an increase in Treg cells in MCAO mice. One
important difference between our study and the earlier study35
is that we examined the consequences of MCAO in mice with
an ongoing autoimmune response. We found increased Treg cell
frequencies during the remission phase of arthritis both in
MCAO and control mice. This increased Treg cell frequency was
not further enhanced by MCAO. Whether Treg cells contribute
to the systemic stroke-induced immunosuppression has not been

analysed to date. Using a genetic model of Treg cell depletion,
we found that Treg cells were dispensable for the
arthritis-ameliorating effect of experimental stroke.
How does stroke mediate these immunomodulatory effects?
Two immediate candidates are the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis and the SNS, both of which are known to be
immunosuppressive and activated in response to stroke.39 An

elegant experimental study showed that both SNS-blockade with
Propranolol or application of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 prevented the apoptosis-induced decrease in
lymphocyte counts. Yet, only Propranolol but not RU486 prevented bacteraemia and pneumonia and improved survival in
MCAO mice.39 Thus, activation of the SNS seems to be a major
mechanism for stroke-induced immunosuppression. Conﬁrming

of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). (A) Depletion of Treg cells
in DEREG mice resulted in chronic inﬂammatory G6PI-induced arthritis
(DEREG/DTx/sham). Disease severity upon MCAO was similar in
DTx-treated DEREG mice that lacked Treg cells (DEREG/DTx/MCAO) and
in non-transgenic littermates (DTx/MCAO) that contained normal
numbers of Treg cells. From day 9 to 39 of clinical arthritis, statistical
signiﬁcance ( p<0.05) for differences in arthritis severity was achieved
with the exception of day 23 between DEREG/DTx/MCAO and DEREG/
DTx/sham, whereas p>0.05 for DEREG/DTx/MCAO and DTx/MCAO mice.

CONCLUSION

17

Experimental stroke causes a global loss of leucocytes and ameliorates arthritis. The correlate of protection from arthritis is
not the reduction of a particular, pathogenic leucocyte subset or
the preferential expansion or emergence of a protective cell
population but the global reduction of leucocytes during
arthritis.
