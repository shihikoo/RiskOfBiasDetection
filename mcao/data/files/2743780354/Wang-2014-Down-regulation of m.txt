Abstract The understanding of molecular mechanism
underlying ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal death
and neurological dysfunction may provide therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke. The up-regulated miRNA-30a
among our previous identified 19 MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
in mouse brain after 6 h middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) could negatively regulate Beclin 1 messenger
RNA (mRNA) resulting in decreased autophagic activity in
tumor cells and cardiomyocytes, but its role in ischemic
stroke is unclear. In this study, the effects of miRNA-30a
on ischemic injury in N2A cells and cultured cortical
neurons after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and
mouse brain with MCAO-induced ischemic stroke were
evaluated. The results showed that miRNA-30a expression
levels were up regulated in the brain of mice after 6 h
MCAO without reperfusion, but significantly down regulated in the peri-infarct region of mice with 1 h MCAO/
24 h reperfusion and in N2A cells after 1 h OGD/6–48 h
reoxygenation. Both the conversion ratio of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II/LC3-I and
Beclin 1 protein level increased in N2A cells and cultured

cortical neurons following 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation.
The down-regulated miRNA-30a could attenuate 1 h OGD/
24 h reoxygenation-induced ischemic injury in N2A cells
and cultured cortical neurons through enhancing Beclin
1-mediated autophagy, as miRNA-30a recognized the 30 untranslated region of beclin 1 mRNA to negatively regulate Beclin 1-protein level via promoting beclin 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, and Beclin 1 siRNA
abolished anti-miR-30a-induced neuroprotection in 1 h
OGD/24 h reoxygenation treated N2A cells. In addition,
anti-miR-30a attenuated the neural cell loss and improved
behavioral outcome of mice with ischemic stroke. These
results suggested that down-regulation of miRNA-30a
alleviates ischemic injury through enhancing beclin
1-mediated autophagy, providing a potential therapeutic
target for ischemic stroke.

Stroke, a serious damage to human health and life safety in
the world refractory diseases, has high incidence, high
morbidity and high mortality characteristics. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that there are numerous
opportunities to improve stroke prevention strategies,
effectively intervene in and treat acute stroke [1]. However,
the molecular mechanism of stroke-induced neuronal death
and neurological dysfunction are not fully known.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important small noncoding
endogenous RNAs of 21–23 nucleotides that negatively
modulate gene expression by binding to the 30 -untranslated

region (30 -UTR) of mRNA [2, 3]. miRNAs are highly conserved, and able to regulate a wide range of biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation,
metabolism and apoptotic cell death [4, 5]. In addition, several
miRNAs have also been reported to be involved in autophagy
modulation by regulating the expression of autophagy-related
genes [6–9]. Beclin 1, the mammalian homologue of yeast
Atg6, was first described as a Bcl-2-interacting protein [10],
and its mediated autophagy plays an important role in the
regulation of cell survival and death [11, 12].
Recently, the accumulating evidence has linked the
changes in cerebral miRNAs expression to the occurrence
and development of ischemic stroke [13–16]. By using
large-scale miRNA microarrays, we have identified 19
differentially expressed miRNAs in the brain of mice with
hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) and 6 h middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) without reperfusion-induced
ischemic stroke. It should be noted that among these 19
miRNAs, the up-regulated miRNA-30a in peri-infarct
region of 6 h MCAO mice could be inhibited by HPC
pretreatment [17]. miRNA-30a could negatively regulate
Beclin 1 mRNA resulting in decreased autophagic activity
in tumor cells [18–20] and cardiomyocytes [21, 22].
However, the role of miRNA-30a in cerebral ischemic
injury and whether it can influence autophagy by regulating
Beclin 1 remain unclear. In this study, we found that the
miRNA-30a expression was up regulated in peri-infarct
region of mice following 6 h MCAO without reperfusion,
but down regulated in the brain of mice with 1 h MCAO/
24 h reperfusion and 1 h oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD)/6–48 h reoxygenation-treated N2A cells. The
down-regulated miRNA-30a could alleviate neural cell
ischemic injuries by enhancing autophagy in vitro and
in vivo through targeting 30 -UTR of Beclin 1 mRNA.

Experimental Procedure
Except the individually indicated agents and antibodies in
the text, the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louise, MO 63103, USA). Adult male C57BL/6 J mice
(weighing 22–25 g) were maintained in temperature-controlled rooms (12-h light–dark cycle) with access to food
and water ad libitum. Experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines set by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Capital Medical University and
were consistent with the NIH Guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals.
MCAO-Induced Ischemic Stroke Mouse Model
The MCAO-induced ischemic stroke mouse model was
prepared as described before [23–25]. In brief, the left

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1279–1291

common and left external carotid arteries were exposed and
ligated through a ventral midline neck incision under the
condition of anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/
kg i.p.). A 5-0 surgical nylon monofilament (0.23 mm in
diameter) was gently inserted through external and internal
carotid arteries to occlude the middle cerebral artery (a
point approximately 12 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation). According to the experimental requirements, two
ischemic stroke mouse models were produced through 6 h
MCAO without reperfusion and 1 h MCAO followed by
24 h reperfusion. At these time points, the infarct volume is
still unstable, but the ischemic penumbra or peri-infarct
region exits more apparently. Sham-operated mice received
the same procedure, without inserting the nylon monofilament. The mouse brains were removed after transcardial
perfusion first with ice cold phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) then 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for Nissl staining; and the cortexes from peri-infarct region were dissected according to the previous reports after 6 h MCAO or
1 h MCAO/24 h perfusion for RT-PCR or Western blot
analysis [23–25].
Measurement of Neurological Deficit
At 24 h after 1 h MCAO, mice were tested for neurological
deficits according to neurological disability status scale
reported by Rodriguez et al. [26]. Briefly, the six major
steps indicate: 0, no neurological dysfunction; 2, slight
decrease in mobility and the presence of passivity; 4,
moderate neurological dysfunction and including additional alterations, such as moderate hypomobility, flattened
posture, lateralized posture, hunched back, ataxic gait,
decreased body tone and muscular strength and slight
motor incoordination; 6, corresponding to more handicapped animals but still able to walk, with more marked
hypomobility, circling, tremor, jerks and/or convulsions,
forelimb flexion and moderate motor incoordination; 8,
corresponding to respiratory distress, and total incapacity
to move/coordinate. Status 10 refers to death due to 1 h
MCAO/24 h reperfusion. In all cases, if the criteria for the
precise grade were not met, the nearest appropriate number
was utilized: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.
Nissl Staining
Mouse brains were removed after transcardial perfusion
with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were post-fixed
in 4 % paraformaldehyde. After dehydration by successive
immersion in 20 and 30 % sucrose solution, brains were
cut into 20 lm-thickness sections and then stained with
0.04 % cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in acetate
buffer for 1 h. Six sections per brain were used for cell
counting. Staining cells in the injured side of the cerebral

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1279–1291

cortex were calculated in three views under the light
microscope (Nikon, 50i, Japan). The final average number
of the six sections from each sample was used for analysis.
Stereotaxic Administration of Lentiviral Vectors
Cortical injection of lentiviral vectors was carried out
5 days before treatment using a stereotaxic instrument
according to the measure reported by Zhou et al. [27].
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
and fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus. 0.7 ll of lentivirus
suspension containing 2 9 109 TU/ml (GeneChem,
Shanghai, RP China) was injected into each point (0.3 mm
anterior, 0.8 and 1.9 mm posterior to the bregma with
3 mm lateral and 2 mm deep for point 1, 2 and 3,
respectively) by using a cannula (28-gauge, inner diameter
0.18 mm, outer diameter 0.36 mm) at a rate of 0.2 ll/min.
All the target points were in the left hemisphere (i.e.,
ipsilateral to the MCAO). The needle was withdrawn over
a course of 10 min. The mice were subjected to MCAO at
5 days after injection of lentiviral vector.
N2A Cell Culture and Treatment
Mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells were generous gift from
the lab of Dr Yun Wang (Peking University) and were
grown to 60 % confluence in growth culture medium of
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco Inc.,
Grand island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal
bovine serum. Then, cells were transfected with pri-miR30a, anti-miR-30a plasmids or their controls (GeneChem,
Shanghai, RP China), and Beclin 1 siRNA (GCTGCCGT
TATACTGTTCT) and negative control siRNAs (GTTCTC
CGAACG TGTCACGT, GenePharma, Shanghai, PR
China) at a final concentration of 20 lM by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Tec., Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The medium
was replaced with the growth culture medium after 6 h
transfection, and then N2A cells were subjected to 1 h
OGD and 24 h reoxygenation post 48 h transfection.
To mimic ischemic-like conditions in vitro, 1 h OGD/048 h reoxygenation treatment was performed on N2A cells.
Cells were transferred into a 37 °C anaerobic chamber
(Thermo Electron LED GmbH, Langenselbold, Germany)
in hypoxic condition (1 % O2/5 % CO2/94 % N2). The
culture medium was replaced with glucose-free DMEM
(Gibco Inc., Grand island, NY14072, USA) and cells were
maintained in the hypoxic chamber for 1 h. After 1 h OGD
exposure, cells were maintained in growth culture medium
under normoxic condition (21 % O2/5 % CO2/74 % N2)
for 0–48 h reoxygenation. Control group was kept in
growth culture medium under normoxic condition.

Primary Cortical Neurons Culture and Lentiviral
Transduction
Primary cortical neurons were obtained from postnatal
24 h C57BL/6 J mice. Cortical neurons were dissociated
and seeded onto plates at a density of 5 9 105 cells per
cm2. Cortical neurons were cultured in neurobasal medium
(Gibco Inc), with 2 % B27 supplement (Gibco Inc). Half of
the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium every
3 days. We transduced cells with lentiviral vectors containing pri-miR-30a, anti-miR-30a or their controls
(GeneChem, Shanghai, RP China) at a multiplicity of
infection of 20 after 6 days according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The efficiency of transducing the lentiviral
vector of containing pri-miR-30a, anti-miR-30a into primary culture of neurons is about 70 %. After 48 h, cortical
neurons subjected to 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation.
For cell viability assessment, the extent of N2A cell
and cultured cortical neuron death were determined by
using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 0.5 mg/
mL; Applichem Inc., Omaha, NE, USA) and the CytoTox
96Ò Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (LDH; Promega
Cor, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) for mRNA
and miRNA Quantification
Total RNA was isolated from cerebral tissues, N2A cells
and cultured cortical neurons with the NucleoSpinÒ miRNA kit (Macherey–Nagel, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. First strand cDNA synthesis
and amplification were performed by using ProtoScriptÒ
M-MuLV First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England
Biolabs Inc. MA 01915, USA). The Brilliant II SYBRÒ
Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Tech., CA 95051, USA)
were used for PCR amplifications according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The primers were used as follows:
beclin 1 (Forward: 50 -GACCGAGTGACCATTCAGGA
AC-30 ; Reverse: 50 -GGTTCT CCATGGTGCCACCATCAG-30 ) and b-actin (Forward: 50 -ATATCGCTGCGCTG
GTCGTC-30 ; Reverse: 50 -AGGATGGCGTGAGGGAGAG
C-30 ). The RT-PCR amplification was performed with an
Mx3000PTM (Agilent Tech., CA 95051, USA). All quantifications were normalized to an endogenous b-actin
control. miRNA-30a expression levels were validated by
using the miRCURY LNATM Universal RT microRNA
PCR (Exiqon A/S, Vedbaek, Denmark) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. U6 was used as an internal
control. Relative expression level between treatments was
then calculated using the following equation: relative gene
expression = 2-(DCt sample - DCt control).

Western-Blot Analysis

Statistical Analysis

Antibodies in this study were rabbit anti-beclin 1 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, catalogue number #3495, USA), anti-microtubule-associated
protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) polyclonal antibody (1:1,000;
Cell Signaling Technology, catalogue number #2775,
USA), anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling Technology, #9662, USA), mouse anti-b-actin
monoclonal antibody (1:3,000; Sigma-Aldrich Corp. St.
Louis, MO 63103, USA), and the horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG as secondary
antibody (1:5,000; Stressgen Biotechnologies Corporation,
Victoria BC, Canada). Total protein was extracted from the
brain, N2A cells or cultured cortical neurons according to
the previous report [28, 29]. 30 lg of total protein were
loaded for SDS-PAGE (12 % SDS gel). Proteins were then
electrophoresed and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare, UK) and blocked
with 10 % non-fat milk in Tween/Tris-buffered salt solution (TTBS, 20 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and
0.05 % Tween-20) for 1 h. Following incubation with the
primary and secondary antibodies, the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare, UK) was used to detect
the signals. The amount of proteins were quantified by
densitometry and normalized to b-actin, an internal
standard.

The GelDoc-2000 Imagine System was used to perform
quantitative analysis of Western blot. For Beclin-1
expression and conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, the ratio
(band density of Beclin-1/band density of b-actin or band
density of LC3-II/band density of LC3-I) was expressed as
100 % in the Control group, and then the other group was
expressed as percentage of that from Control group. Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by all pair wise multiple
comparison procedures using Bonferroni test. The values
were presented as mean ± SEM, and the significance was
regarded as at least p \ 0.05.

Luciferase Assays
A 567 bp fragment from the 30 -UTR of Beclin 1 mRNA
containing the predicted miR-30a binding sequences was
amplified by PCR from 3T3 cell genomic DNA, and then
cloned into the pmiR-RB-REPORTTM luciferase reporter
vector (RIBOBIO, Guangzhou, China). The primer sets
were used as follows: 30 -UTR of Beclin1 mRNA (Forward:
50 -CCGCTCGAGCTTGCTCCTTAG GGGATGTTT G-30 ;
Reverse: 50 -GAATGCGGCCGCAATAGACCATAGCAA
ATCCTTTATTAC-30 ) and 30 -UTR mutant of Beclin1
mRNA (Forward: 50 -CCACAACGTGTAAATACCAAAA
TCCACAAAAG-30 ; Reverse: 50 -TTTGGTATTTACACG
TTGTGGTTTAATATTACC-30 ). Both wild type and
mutant were confirmed by sequencing.
Mouse N2A cells were plated at 0.5 9 105 cells per well
in 24-well plates. The following day, cells were co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORTTM luciferase reporter
vector, including the 30 -UTR of beclin 1 mRNA either wild
type or mutant miRNA-30a binding sites, and pri-miR-30a
or pri-miR-30a control plasmid by using Lipofectamine
2000. Luciferase assays were performed with a GloMax 20
Luminometer 48 h after transfection using Dual-LuciferaseÒ Reporter Assay System (Promega Cor, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results
Changes of miRNA-30a, Beclin 1 and LC3-I/II
Expression Levels in Ischemic Cortex of MCAO Mice
and OGD-Treated N2A Cells
To determine miRNA-30a expression status in cerebral
cortex of mice after ischemic stroke, we found that miRNA-30a expression level was up-regulated in the periinfarct region of mice with 6 h MCAO without reperfusion,
but significantly decreased after 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion when compared with that of the sham group (Fig. 1a).
To verify the result in vitro, the miRNA-30a expression
level was also tested in N2A cells after 1 h OGD/0–48 h
reoxygenation. As shown in Fig. 1b, the level of miRNA30a expression was not changed after 1 h OGD only, and
then was significantly down-regulated in mouse N2A cells
during 6–48 h reoxygenation post 1 h OGD. Similarly, the
N2A cell survival rate decreased significantly at 6–48 h
reoxygenation and reached the lowest level of 45 % at 24 h
reoxygenation post 1 h OGD (Fig. 1c).
To confirm the existence of autophagy in 1 h OGD/
0–48 h reoxygenation treated N2A cells, the Beclin 1 and
LC3 conversion levels were determined by using Western
blot (Fig. 1d). The quantitative analysis demonstrated that
both levels of conversion of microtubule-associated protein
1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II and Beclin 1 increased
gradually and reached the highest level in N2A cells following 24 h reoxygenation post 1 h OGD (Fig. 1e, f),
suggesting an important role of autophagy in ischemic
injury.

binding sequences or its mutant 30 -UTR (Fig. 4a). The
luciferase activity assay indicated that pri-miR-30a not its
mutant significantly decreased luciferase activity of the
reporter vector containing miRNA-30a binding sequences
of beclin 1 mRNA 30 -UTR (Fig. 4b). In addition, pri-miR30a and anti-miR-30a could down- or up-regulate both
beclin 1 mRNA (Fig. 4c) and protein expression levels in
OGD-treated N2A cells (Fig. 2d). These results suggested
that miRNA-30a could directly recognize the 30 -UTR of
beclin 1 mRNA to negatively regulate Beclin 1-protein
levels through promoting degradation of its mRNA.
To demonstrate the contribution of Beclin 1 to the
biological effects of miRNA-30a in OGD-induced ischemic injury, we co-transfected Beclin 1 siRNA and antimiR-30a in N2A cells, and then detected LC3-I conversion
(Fig. 5a, b), Beclin 1 protein expression (Fig. 5a, c), and
cell survival rate (Fig. 5d) in N2A cells after 1 h OGD/

Effect of miRNA-30a on MCAO-Induced Autophagy
and Ischemic Injury in Vivo
To further evaluate the role of miRNA-30a in cerebral
ischemic injury in vivo, we used stereotaxic injection of
lentivirus-based pri-miR-30a, anti-miR-30a and their controls into cerebral cortex of mice. The up- and down-regulated miRNA-30a levels in ischemic cortex of MCAO
mice were confirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR
(Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b–d, pri-miR-30a could
decrease the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and Beclin 1
expression, while anti-miR-30a increased the ratio of LC3II/LC3-I and Beclin 1 protein levels in ischemic cortex of
mice after 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion. Consequently, primiR-30a enhanced neural cell loss and neurological deficit,
whereas anti-miR-30a could effectively attenuate ischemic
injury by reducing neural cell loss in ischemic cortex and
neurological scores of mice after 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion (Fig. 7a–c). These data suggested that down-regulation of miRNA-30a can provide neuroprotection against
ischemic injuries in vivo through enhancing Beclin
1-mediated autophagy.

Discussion

Fig. 4 miRNA-30a directly recognizes the 30 -UTR of Beclin1
mRNA and regulates its mRNA expression levels in N2A cells.
a Showed the design of a miRNA-30a luciferase reporter vector
containing a T7-driven-luciferase cDNA fused to a 30 -UTR of Beclin
1 mRNA or mutated Beclin 1 mRNA. The sequence of miRNA-30a
and the putative binding position in the 30 -UTR of Beclin 1 mRNA
was also shown. b Luciferase reporter assay was performed by cotransfection of luciferase reporter containing 30 -UTR (wild type or
mutant) of Beclin 1 mRNA with pri-miR-30a or its control into N2A
cells. The results of luciferase activity demonstrated that cotransfection of pri-miR-30a with wild type (not mutant) vector
resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity at 48 h after
transfection (n = 6 per group). c The RT-PCR results showed that

Beclin 1 expression by using siRNA could abolish antimiR-30a-induced neuroprotective effect in 1 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation treated N2A cells.

In this study, we reported three main findings as follows.
The first is that miRNA-30a expression was down regulated in N2A cells during 6–48 h reoxygenation post 1 h
OGD-induced ischemic injury in vitro and in the periinfarct region of mice after 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusioninduced ischemic stroke in vivo. However, the expression
level of miRNA-30a was up regulated in the brain of mice
after 6 h MCAO without reperfusion, which is consistent
with our previous results of large-scale miRNA microarray
[17]. Secondly, we confirmed that the differentially
expressed miRNA-30a in brain of mice with ischemic
stroke could directly recognize the 30 -UTR of beclin 1
mRNA to negatively regulate Beclin 1-protein levels
through promoting degradation of its mRNA. The third is
that down-regulation of miRNA-30a can provide neuroprotection against ischemic injuries in vitro and in vivo
through enhancing Beclin 1-mediated autophagy. The difference of miRNA-30a expression in brain of mice after
6 h MCAO without reperfusion and 1 h MCAO/24 h
reperfusion might be due to the duration of MCAO and
reperfusion. Further studies are needed to explore whether
the high expression of miRNA-30a can serve as biomarker
for clinical diagnosis in acute cerebral ischemia.
A subset of miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the
human brain [30], and play important roles in numerous
brain diseases [31–33]. In our previous study, miRNAs
profiling techniques were performed to identify the

significantly changed miRNAs in the brain of mice with
ischemic stroke. miRNA-30a, one of the 19 differentially
expressed miRNAs, was up-regulated in both cerebral
cortex of HPC and the peri-infarct region of 6 h MCAO
treated mice [17]. There were several studies about miRNA-30a target genes and their involvements in pathophysiological process. For examples, miRNA-30a is
significantly down-regulated in highly metastatic colorectal
cancer (CRC) cell lines and metastatic tissues, and may be
a potential therapeutic target to block CRC metastasis [34];
the down-regulated miRNA-30a in non-small-cell lung
cancer inhibits invasion and metastasis by targeting Snai1
[35]; as a potential prognostic marker, miRNA-30a could
inhibit breast tumor growth, metastasis and invasion by
targeting metadherin and vimentin [36]. Interestingly,
recent reports also revealed that miRNA-30a is enriched in
layer III pyramidal neurons, and negatively regulates brain
derived neurotrophic factor expression in prefrontal cortex
[37]; decreased miRNA-30a expression possibly contributes to the neuroprotective effect of neuropeptide Y in rat

cortical neurons exposed to Ab [38]; and the circulating
miRNA-30a may serve as a potential biomarker for acute
myocardial infarction [39].
Autophagy plays key cellular functions such as degradation of long-lived proteins, organelle turnover, and
adaptation to nutrient depletion, cellular development, and
anti-aging. However, the role of autophagy in brain after
ischemia/reperfusion injury is controversial. Some studies
show that excessive autophagy plays a death-promoting
role in neuronal death after stroke [40–42] and others
support that autophagy is neuroprotective [43–45]. These
contradictory conclusions might be due to both the extent
and time point of autophagy induction in determining the
result after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. During
autophagy, LC3 is processed from LC3-I (16 kDa) to LC3II (14-kDa), which is recruited to autophagosomes, and the
increase in the LC3-II/I ratio is an indicator of up-regulated
autophagy [46]. As expected, we found that after ischemia/
reperfusion injury, the ratios of LC3-II to LC3-I were
increased in cerebral cortex and in N2A cells. The results

demonstrated that up-regulation of miRNA-30a by pri-miR-30a could
inhibit the ratio of LC3-II/I and reduced Beclin 1 protein expression
level. In contrast, down-regulation of miRNA-30a by anti-miR-30a
injection could effectively elevate the ratio of LC3-II/I and increased
Beclin 1 protein expression level in in ischemic cortex of 1 h MCAO/
24 h reperfusion treated mice with ischemic stroke. *P \ 0.05 versus

of our study also indicate that upon ischemia/reperfusion
conditions, activation of autophagy was enhanced in antimiR-30a treated group, whereas autophagy was inhibited in
pri-miR-30a treated group. Theses demonstrated that protective autophagy was induced in our models because targeting miRNA-30a-mediated autophagy exacerbated neural
cell death after ischemia/reperfusuion injury, suggesting that
after a period of reperfusion, autophagy may rescue cells by
eliminating damaged organelles and protein aggregates.
According to the prediction of miRNA targets in human
(http://www.targetscan.org) and in vertebrates (http://pic
tar.mdc-berlin.de/), miRNA-30a may regulate the expression of beclin 1 at the post-transcriptional level by pairing
with partially complementary sites in the 30 -UTR of beclin
1 mRNA. In additional experiments, we also demonstrated
that miRNA-30a could directly bind with the 30 -UTR of
beclin 1 mRNA and promote its mRNA degradation. PrimiR-30a decreased the expression of beclin 1, while antimiR-30a increased its level in mouse brain after MCAO-

ischemic stroke in vivo and in N2A cells after OGDinduced ischemic injury in vitro. Furthermore, beclin 1
siRNA could block anti-miR-30a-mediated autophagy and
neuroprotection in OGD-treated N2A cells. Taken together,
these results provide strong evidence that miRNA-30a
mediates the autophagy through negatively regulating
autophagy-related gene beclin 1 mRNA level in cerebral
ischemic injury. However, there’s also a report that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K) catalytic subunit delta is a
direct target of miR-30a as miR-30a bounds directly to the
30 -UTR of PI3 K catalytic subunit delta mRNA [34]. The
PI3 K/protein kinase B (PKB also Akt)/the mammalian
target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway negatively regulate autophagy under certain conditions [47, 48].
The role of PI3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in miR30a-mediated autophagy after ischemic stroke should be
observed in the future experiments.
In addition, we should notice that down-regulation of
miRNA-30a in cultured neuronal cells with OGD/

a Typical images of Nissl staining showed the effect of miRNA-30a
on neural cell loss in ischemic cortex of mice after 1 h MCAO/24 h
reperfusion (scale bar = 100 lm). b Quantitative analysis demonstrated that up- and down-regulation of miRNA-30a through injection
of lentivirus-based pri-miR-30a and anti-miR-30a could significantly
enhance and attenuate the neural cell loss in ischemic cortex of mice
after 1 h MCAO/24 h reperfusion, respectively (n = 6 per group).
c Results of the neurological score indicated that pri-miR-30a and
anti-miR-30a could separably aggravate and improve the neurological
deficit of MCAO mice with ischemic stroke (n = 6 per group).

reduced cell loss by increasing beclin 1-mediated autophagy might not be enough to provide protective effects at
these conditions.
In summary, we have provided evidence that the downregulation of miRNA-30a in brain of mice with ischemic
stroke and in OGD-treated neurons could alleviate ischemic injury through enhancing beclin 1-mediated autophagy. The findings point out a novel mechanism for the
regulation of ischemic neural cell death through miRNA30a, and suggest that regulation of miRNA-30a and/or
beclin1 in the brain could be potential therapeutic targets
for ischemic stroke. Further work is needed to explore the
stroke-related function of this particular miRNA in more
time points of brain ischemia and reperfusion injury.
