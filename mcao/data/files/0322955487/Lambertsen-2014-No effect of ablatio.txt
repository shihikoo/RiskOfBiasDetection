Abstract
Background: Crosstalk between the immune system in the brain and the periphery may contribute to the
long-term outcome both in experimental and clinical stroke. Although, the immune defense collectin surfactant
protein-D (SP-D) is best known for its role in pulmonary innate immunity, SP-D is also known to be involved in
extrapulmonary modulation of inflammation in mice. We investigated whether SP-D affected cerebral ischemic
infarction and ischemia-induced inflammatory responses in mice.
Methods: The effect of SP-D was studied by comparing the size of ischemic infarction and the inflammatory
and astroglial responses in SP-D knock out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion. SP-D mRNA production was assessed in isolated cerebral arteries and in the whole brain by PCR, and
SP-D protein in normal appearing and ischemic human brain by immunohistochemistry. Changes in plasma SP-D and
TNF were assessed by ELISA and proximity ligation assay, respectively.
Results: Infarct volumetric analysis showed that ablation of SP-D had no effect on ischemic infarction one and five days
after induction of ischemia. Further, ablation of SP-D had no effect on the ischemia-induced increase in TNF mRNA
production one day after induction of ischemia; however the TNF response to the ischemic insult was affected
at five days. SP-D mRNA was not detected in parenchymal brain cells in either naïve mice or in mice subjected
to focal cerebral ischemia. However, SP-D mRNA was detected in middle cerebral artery cells in WT mice and
SP-D protein in vascular cells both in normal appearing and ischemic human brain tissue. Measurements of the
levels of SP-D and TNF in plasma in mice suggested that levels were unaffected by the ischemic insult.
Microglial-leukocyte and astroglial responses were comparable in SP-D KO and WT mice.
Conclusions: SP-D synthesis in middle cerebral artery cells is consistent with SP-D conceivably leaking into the
infarcted area and affecting local cytokine production. However, there was no SP-D synthesis in parenchymal
brain cells and ablation of SP-D had no effect on ischemic cerebral infarction.

Introduction
Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a C-type collectin mediating
various effector mechanisms, such as opsonization of
pathogenic microorganisms and cellular debris, chemotaxis
of phagocytes [1], activation of phagocytosis [2,3] and
modulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) activity [4,5]. SP-D

knock out (KO) mice display increased lung inflammation,
including increased lung levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases and oxidant species [3,6,7]. Besides important roles in pulmonary innate immunity, SP-D
is also involved in systemic lipid homeostasis [8,9]. The
major site of SP-D synthesis is the pulmonary epithelium
and other epithelia [10], however, SP-D synthesis also takes
place in vascular smooth muscle [11] and vascular endothelial cells [9,12]. SP-D has been demonstrated to affect
vascular pathology and to be pro-atherogenic in mice [9].

Studies of experimental and clinical stroke indicate
that the complement system contributes to ischemic injury [13-15]. The collectin mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
has been shown to play a central pathogenic role in ischemic injury through deposition and complement activation
on ischemic endothelium [16-18]. SP-D does not activate
complement, yet, serum SP-D levels were recently shown
to correlate to dementia and augmented mortality [19],
raising the possibility that SP-D may affect neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes in the brain. Suggested
cellular receptors for SP-D include TLR2 and TLR4 [4],
which are upregulated after induction of focal cerebral ischemia [20] and the myeloid inhibitory immunoreceptor
Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine
phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1/SIRPα) [21,22]. SHPS1/SIRPα is expressed by neurons and phagocytic cells and
is recognized to be involved in neuroprotection in experimental stroke in mice [23]. Plasma proteins leak into the
ischemic brain both after reperfusion-ischemia, and permanent focal cerebral ischemia, where leakage takes place
through collaterals in the peri-infarct. We therefore hypothesized that SP-D might leak into the ischemic area
either from the circulation or from the deranged endothelium and reduce infarction after experimental stroke in
mice.

Materials and methods
Animals

For the infarct volumetric and glial/leukocyte analyses
we used young adult (six to nine weeks), male SP-D KO
mice [24], crossed > ten times onto the C57BL/6 N background [25]. Mice were kept as a colony at the Biomedical
Laboratory, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of
Southern Denmark. The mice have previously been shown
to be deficient in SP-D mRNA and protein expression
[24]. Male, age-matched, wild type (WT) C57BL/6 N mice
were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA,
USA). Other analyses were performed on six- to nineweek old male C57BL/6 J mice or NMRI mice, purchased
from Taconic (Ry, Denmark). The NMRI mice (non-inbred) were included for comparison with C57BL/6 mice
for vasculature analysis. Mice were housed under diurnal
lighting conditions with free access to food and water. The
experimental procedures were approved by the Danish
Animal Ethical Committee (J number 2005/561-1068 and
2011/561-1950).
Focal cerebral ischemia

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of the distal part of the left middle cerebral artery
(pMCAO) as previously described [26]. SP-D KO and WT
mice were randomized to three experimental groups: one
group of unmanipulated control mice and two groups of
mice that were subjected to pMCAO and allowed either

one day or five days post-surgical survival. For analysis of
plasma TNF, C57BL/6 mice were allowed 30 minutes, and
1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours survival after pMCAO. Furthermore, C57BL/6 mice with five days survival were included
for immunohistochemical detection of SP-D.
Mice were anaesthetized by subcutaneous (sc) injection
of a mixture of Hypnorm (fentanyl citrate 0.315 mg/ml
and fluanisone 10 mg/ml, Jansen-Cilag A/S, Birkerød,
Denmark), Stesolid (5 mg/ml diazepamum, Dumex) and
distilled water (1:1:2) (0.21 ml/10 g body weight). For
post-surgery analgesia, mice were injected with Temgesic
(0.001 mg/20 g buprenorphinum sc, Schering-Plough A/S,
Ballerup, Denmark) three times with an 8-hour interval
starting immediately after surgery. Mice were allowed to
recover from surgery in a recovery room at 28°C. Mice
allowed five days survival were returned to the conventional animal facility after 24 hours.
Mouse tissue processing
Fresh frozen brain tissue

Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Upon removal,
brains were frozen in CO2-snow and cut into 6 series of
30-μm-thick sections. Every 12th section was placed in
an RNase free Eppendorf tube for RNA-extraction, reverse transcription and qPCR analysis of whole brain.
Tissue was stored in sealed boxes at −80°C until further
processing. Lung and spleen tissue, intended for standard curves in qPCR analyses, was obtained from a
subset of mice.
Paraformaldehyde fixed brains

Mice to be used for immunohistochemistry for SP-D
were overdosed with Pentobarbital (Den kgl. Veterinærog Landbohøjskoles Apotek, Copenhagen, Denmark) and
perfused through the left ventricle with 5 ml chilled
0.15 M Sorensen’s phosphate buffer (So-PB, pH 7.4)
followed by 20 ml chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
0.15 M So-PB, pH 7.4 [27]. Brains and lung tissue were
post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hour, followed by 1% PFA overnight, and rinsing in PBS before embedding in paraffin.
Paraffin sections were prepared as 10-μm-thick sections
mounted on Super Frost slides (Hounisen, Skanderborg,
Denmark).
Preparation of plasma for TNF analysis

At the time of decapitation, blood was collected into
EDTA coated Eppendorf tubes. Samples were spun twice
at 3,000 × g for 10 minutes and supernatants collected
and stored at −80°C, until further processing.
Preparation of plasma for SP-D analysis

Blood was sampled by eye vein puncture and collected
into EDTA coated Eppendorf tubes for SP-D plasma
analysis. Blood was obtained from naïve C57BL/6 mice

Lambertsen et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:123
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/11/1/123

and from pMCAO mice immediately before surgery or
decapitation.
Infarct volumetric analysis

One series of brain sections from mice that had survived
one or five days was stained with toluidine blue and the
direct infarct volume was estimated using the Cavalieri
principle for volume estimation [26,28]. The volume of
the infarct (Vtotal) was calculated using:
X
V total ¼
P ⋅ t ⋅ apo int
where ∑P is the total number of points hitting the infarct, t is the mean distance between sections, and apoint
represents the area per point [28]. The point-counting
was performed using the Computer Assisted Stereological
Test (CAST) GRID microscope-system (Olympus Denmark
A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). In addition, the volume of
the contralateral cortex, the non-ischemic ipsilateral
cortex, and the volume of the infarct spanning from
1,080 μm anterior to 1,080 μm posterior of the anterior
commissure was compared in SP-D KO and WT mice
at day 1 after pMCAO using a method of indirect infarct
volume estimation [29,30].
Immunohistochemistry for murine CD11b, CD45 and Gr1
Antibodies

The primary antibodies used for detection of CD11b
immunopositive (CD11b+) microglia/macrophages, CD45+
microglia/leukocytes, and Gr1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages, consisted of monoclonal
rat-anti-CD11b (clone 5C6, MCA711), rat-anti-CD45
(clone IBL-3/16, MCA1388), and rat-anti-Gr1 (clone
RB6-8C5, MCA2387GA), respectively, which were obtained from Serotec, Kidlington, UK. Rat IgG1 or IgG2b
(Nordic Biosite, Sweden) were used as isotype controls.
Control stained sections where the primary antibody was
replaced with either buffer or isotype control were devoid
of specific staining.
Staining procedure

CD11b staining The fresh frozen sections were fixed
2 minutes in 4% formalin, followed by 2 minutes in 50%
acetone, 2 minutes in 100% acetone, and 2 minutes in
50% acetone [27]. Following fixation and air drying, sections were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) + 1%
Triton, pH 7.4, for 30 minutes and treated with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) in TBS for 30 minutes at room
temperature (RT). Next, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary rat-anti-CD11b diluted in
TBS and 10% FCS (1:600). The next day, sections were
rinsed 3 × 15 minutes in TBS + 1% Triton at RT and incubated for 1 hour at RT with the secondary biotinylated
goat anti-rat IgG (Vector BA1400) diluted 1:200 in

Page 3 of 13

TBS and 10% FCS, followed by rinsing 3 × 15 minutes
in TBS + 1% Triton, and incubation for 1 hour at RT
with streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) (GE
Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) diluted 1:200 in
TBS and 10% FCS. Sections were thereafter rinsed
3 × 15 minutes in TBS and developed in 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.033% H2O2 in TBS at RT. Finally,
sections were coverslipped with Depex.
CD45 staining The fresh frozen sections incubated with
the rat-anti-CD45 IgG were processed as described
above. After incubation with rat-anti-CD45 (1:50), the
sections were rinsed 3 × 15 minutes in TBS, incubated
with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rat IgG (Sigma
A8438) diluted 1:50, rinsed 3 × 15 minutes in TBS,
followed by a 15 minute rinse in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.5), and development in a Tris-HCl-MgCl2
buffer (pH 9.5) containing nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride
and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate yielding a
bluish-black reaction product [27]. Sections were finally
rinsed in TBS followed by H2O and coverslipped with
Aquatex (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
Gr1 staining The staining for Gr1 (1:200) was performed on sections from PFA-fixed brains. The procedure was as described for CD11b using DAB for the
development. To allow distinction of nuclear characteristics, sections were counterstained with toluidine blue
prior to dehydration and coverslipping with Depex.
Immunofluorescence staining for glial fibrillary acidic
protein

Fresh frozen sections intended for fluorescence staining
for astroglial glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were
fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, air dried and processed as described in Clausen et al. [31] using a rabbit
anti-cow GFAP antibody (DakoCytomation A/S, Glostrup,
Denmark) and a Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Europe BV,
Nærum, Denmark). Sections incubated with buffer or
rabbit serum (DakoCytomation) were devoid of signal.
Microdissection of cerebral arteries in mouse

The deeply anesthetized mice were perfused with ice cold
isotonic sodium chloride, and the brain was dissected and
placed in ice cold physiological salt solution (in mmol/L:
NaCl 115, NaHCO3 25, MgSO4 1.2, K2HPO4 2.5, CaCl2
1.3, glucose 5.5, and HEPES 10). Posterior communicating
arteries and middle cerebral arteries were isolated under a
stereomicroscope and frozen in liquid nitrogen along with
the aorta. RNA was extracted as described below.

Quantitative real-time PCR on cerebral arteries and mouse
brain

Mouse arteries from C57Bl/6 (inbred) and NMRI (noninbred) mice were crushed in a mortar and RNA was
isolated using TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and reverse transcribed using Superscript and
oligo (dT). RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis of brain
tissue were performed as previously described [32]. Realtime detection of SP-D in brain homogenates and isolated mouse arteries was performed on an iCycler using
SYBR Green as the fluorescent reporter molecule as previously described [33] and the following primer sets:
1) sense: AAGGGTGATCCAGGTTTGCCA and
antisense: GAGGTCCACTTAGTCCACGTTCT
(exon 2-3-4),
2) sense: AACGTGGACTAAGTGGACCTCC and
antisense: AGCACCTACTTCTCCTTTGGGC
(exon 3-4-5),
3) sense: GGAGAAGTAGGTGCTCCTGGC and
antisense: GCATTCCCTGGGGCTCCTTG (exon 5),
4) sense: CCTGGAGACAGAGGAATCAAAGGT and
antisense: CAGGGAACAATGCAGCTTTCTGA.
Real-time detection of CD11b, TNF, hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyl-transferase 1 (HPRT1) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was based
on fluorescent detection generated by TaqMan probes
and primer sets using the following primers and probes:
CD11b (sense:
CGGAAAGTAGTGAGAGAACTGTTC, antisense:
CTTATAATCCAAGGGATCACCGAATTT and probe:
TCTGTGATGACAACTAGGATCTTCGCAGCA), and
probe:
TGCACTACAGGCTCCGAGATGAACAACAA),
TNF (sense: TGGCCTCCCTCTCATCAGTTC,
antisense: CCACTTGGTGGTTTGCTACGA and
probe: TGGCCCAGACCCTCACACTCAGATCATC),
HPRT1 (sense:
GTTAAGCAGTACAGCCCCAAAATG, antisense:
AAATCCAACAAAGTCTGGCCTGTA and probe:
AGCTTGCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCGAAGT),
GAPDH (sense:
TCAAGCTCATTTCCTGGTATGACA, antisense:
CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAG and probe:
TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCG) as previously
described [30,32,34].
Standard curves were generated from a five-fold diluted
series of cDNA derived from either spleen (CD11b, TNF,
HPRT1, GAPDH) or lung tissue (SP-D). Data were normalized to the reference genes HPRT1 or GAPDH. All
values were calibrated to a pool of cDNA from naïve

C57BL/6 N mice. Less than two-fold increases in transcript levels were not subjected to statistical analysis [32].
SP-D data are presented as 2dd-Ct values.
Immunohistochemistry for SP-D in mouse brain

In addition to purchasing a commercially available rabbit
anti-mouse SP-D (AB3434, lot number: NG1734281,
Merck Millipore) antibody, we tested a panel of 20
monoclonal antibodies made in-house by immunizing
SP-D KO mice with recombinant SP-D for their specificity towards murine SP-D. Antibodies were tested on
sections from paraffin embedded and frozen tissue samples using different fixation protocols. None of the above
antibodies yielded specific-like staining
ELISA for SP-D in plasma

Mouse SP-D ELISA was carried out as described previously [35]. The validated and calibrated in-house ELISA
takes advantage of two monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes on mouse SP-D. The detector antibody is biotinylated and detected with streptavidin-HRP.
Readouts were performed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) as substrate and measured at 492 nm
with subtraction of 600-nm background-signal. Samples
of plasma were diluted 1:5 and measured in duplicates.
The minimal detection limit of the ELISA was 0.9 ng/ml,
which after dilution of plasma samples resulted in a detection limit of 5 ng/ml. Sample concentrations below detection limit are referred to as < 5 ng/ml.
Proximity ligation assay for TNF in plasma

Proximity probes were prepared using the Proseek probemaker kit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and all the
mentioned reagents were contained within the kit. In
brief, 1 μL of conjugation buffer was mixed with 10 μL
of affinity-purified polyclonal TNF antibody (1 mg/mL)
(R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Abington, UK, AF-410-NA).
The antibody solution was then transferred to vial A
containing either the 3′-hydroxyl or to vial B containing
the 5′-phosphate free oligonucleotides and incubated at
37°C for 3 hours. To end incubation, 1 μL of Stop reagent was added to vial A and B, followed by 30 minutes
incubation at RT. To finalize the conjugation, 9.6 μL of
the incubation reaction was mixed with storage solution
(A or B). The final concentrations of probe A and B
were 130 nM. The proximity extension assay (Proseek,
Olink, Uppsala, Sweden) procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, 1 μL
of sample (Calibrator diluent ± antigen or mouse EDTA
plasma ± antigen) was mixed with 3 μL Probe master
mix containing probe A, probe B and assay solution.
Samples were incubated at RT for two hours. After
probe incubation, the samples were transferred to a

Lambertsen et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:123

thermal cycler where pre-extension and extension took
place. Until real-time PCR detection, the product was
stored at 4°C for a maximum of 24 hours or at −20°C.
For the qPCR detection, 4 μL of the extension products
was transferred to a 384-well qPCR plate and mixed
with 5.8 μL real-time PCR solution and 0.2 μL real-time
PCR polymerase (1U/μL). The real-time PCR was run
with a denaturation step at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed
by 15 seconds denaturation at 95°C and 1 minute annealing at 60°C for 45 cycles. For the Proseek measurements a standard curve of ten-fold dilutions was prepared
from recombinant TNF (1 mg/mL) (T7539, SigmaAldrich Denmark Aps, Brøndby, Denmark) diluted in
Calibrator diluent buffer. This standard curve was additionally mixed with mouse EDTA plasma to investigate
the effectiveness of the Proseek TNF measurements in this
biologically more complex sample.

Results
Comparable infarct sizes in SP-D KO and WT mice

Focal cerebral ischemia induced by pMCAO caused a unilateral cortical infarct affecting the frontal and parietal cortices
in both SP-D KO and WT mice (Figure 1A). When performing direct infarct volume analysis, we found similar infarct volumes in SP-D KO (21.12 mm3 ± 10.89 mm3, n = 10)
and WT (25.11 mm3 ± 10.64 mm3, n = 8) mice 1 day after
pMCAO (P = 0.45, Figure 1B). Similarly, when we corrected
for edema at day 1, at the time of maximal brain edema [29],
we found that the percentage of infarcted cortex was

Immunohistochemistry for SP-D in human brain

The study was performed on post mortem brain tissue
from four stroke patients obtained from the Department
of Pathology, Odense University Hospital and the use of
human brains was approved by the Danish Biomedical
Research Ethical committee for the Region of Southern
Denmark (permission number S-20080042). Tissue blocks
containing both infarcted and normal appearing brain tissue, in addition to human lung tissue, were embedded in
paraffin and serial sections were stained for SP-D, as previously described [9] and for CD45 as routinely performed
at the Department of Pathology. The clinical data are provided in Table 1.

Statistical analysis

Results are presented as mean ± SD. For comparison between means in two groups, unpaired Student’s t-test
was used. For comparisons of more than two groups,
two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s Multiple
Comparison Test with the unlesioned control mice as
the reference control were used. Pearson’s correlation
analysis was used to correlate the percentage of infarcted
cortex with TNF mRNA levels. For all tests, P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

comparable in SP-D KO mice (35.81% ± 16.48%) and WT
mice (38.15% ± 11.28%, P = 0.73), emphasizing that SP-D has
no influence on acute cerebral infarction. In addition, comparison of infarct volumes in SP-D KO (13.49 mm3 ±
6.02 mm3, n = 14) and WT (11.43 mm3 ± 4.99 mm3, n = 15)
mice 5 days after pMCAO showed no difference in infarct
volumes (P = 0.33, Figure 1B). Taken together, the results
demonstrate that ablation of SP-D has no effect on the development of the infarct.

in WT mice, we found evidence of a linear correlation
between TNF mRNA levels and infarct size at day 5
(Figure 2B), which was not observed at day 1 (P = 0.55).
This correlation was not observed in SP-D KO mice
(day 1: P = 0.94; day 5: P = 0.44). Overall, however, the
results suggest that the TNF response to the acute ischemic attack is preserved in the absence of SP-D.

Unaffected TNF response to ischemia in SP-D KO mice

To our knowledge there is no published information on
the effect of SP-D on microglia. SP-D is, however,
known to be chemotactic to monocytes and PMNs [1],
which both infiltrate the ischemic infarct and express
CD11b [31]. To evaluate the effect of SP-D on the
microglial and leukocytic response to ischemia we therefore compared brain CD11b mRNA levels in naïve WT
and SP-D KO mice and in WT and SP-D KO mice

In line with previous findings in the C57BL/6 J mouse
[30], TNF mRNA levels were significantly upregulated at
day 1 (P < 0.001), and had decreased again 5 days after
pMCAO in WT mice (Figure 2A). The same was true
for SP-D KO mice, which also showed significantly increased TNF mRNA levels 1 day after pMCAO (P <
0.01), which again were decreased at day 5. Interestingly,

Comparable microglial and leukocytic response to
ischemia in SP-D KO and WT mice

Figure 2 Changes in inflammatory profile between surfactant protein-D (SP-D) knock out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice after permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). (A) No differences were observed in TNF mRNA levels between naïve SP-D KO and WT mice nor
between SP-D KO and WT at 24 hours or 5 days after pMCAO. Both genotypes showed a significant increase in TNF mRNA levels at 24 hours
compared to naïve and 5 days (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, n = 5 to 8). (B) TNF mRNA levels correlated
with the infarct volume in WT mice 5 days after pMCAO (Spearman’s r = 0.99), a correlation which was not present in SP-D KO mice. (C) No
difference was observed in CD11b mRNA levels between naïve SP-D KO and WT mice or at 24 hours or 5 days. (D) Immunohistochemical
staining for CD11b at 1 day and 5 days after pMCAO showed similar microglial-leukocyte activation in SP-D KO and WT mice. (E) No difference
was observed in PMN infiltration assessed by nuclear morphology in toluidine blue-stained sections, or infiltration with CD45+ cells between
SP-D and WT at 24 hours. Insert: immunohistochemical demonstration of Gr1 by PMN. IF: infarct, P-IF: peri-infarct. Scale bars: D = 200 μm,

allowed 1 and 5 days survival after pMCAo (Figure 2C).
There was no difference in CD11b mRNA levels between WT and SP-D KO mice at any time point investigated and no difference in mice subjected to pMCAO
and naïve mice. In line with these findings, inspection of
CD11b-stained sections from WT and SP-D KO mice
with 1 day (n = 8 and 10 per group, respectively), and
5 days (n = 14 per group) survival (Figure 2D), revealed
that the two mouse strains showed a comparable increase of microglial/leukocyte CD11b expression in the
peri-infarct and the infarct compared to naïve control
WT and SP-D KO mice. To additionally differentiate
between leukocyte subsets, we analyzed toluidine bluestained sections from WT and SP-D KO mice for infiltrating PMNs 1 day after pMCAO (Figure 2E). The use
of nuclear characteristics for identification of PMNs
was confirmed by staining for Gr1 (insert in Figure 2E),
which is expressed on the surface membrane of PMNs

Page 7 of 13

and macrophages [36,37]. Infiltrating Gr1+ cells were
relatively abundant in the peri-infarct and infarct of
WT and SP-D KO mice (Figure 2E), with no difference between genotypes. Similarly, cells expressing CD45, which
in addition to macrophages and PMNs is expressed in high
levels on lymphocytes [37], showed a comparable infiltration of the peri-infarct and infarct in WT and SP-D KO
mice (Figure 2E). Taken together, the findings suggest that
ablation of SP-D has no effect on microglial/leukocyte recruitment in response to the ischemic insult.
Astroglial response to ischemia is comparable in SP-D KO
and WT mice

Differences in astroglial response were assessed by immunofluorescence staining for GFAP. In both SP-D KO
and WT mice, GFAP+ astrocytes were absent in the infarct core at day 1 (Figure 3). Astroglial GFAP expression was increased in the peri-infarct in both WT and

Figure 4 Proseek analysis of TNF levels in plasma. (A) The
performance of the Proseek TNF assay was evaluated by comparing
series of dilution curves of TNF spiked in either Calibrator diluent
buffer or mouse EDTA plasma. Recombinant TNF was spiked in
Calibrator diluent buffer or mouse EDTA plasma and measured by
Proseek TNF assay. The fold dilution is indicated on the x-axis and
the signal is plotted as crossing point (Cp) values. The very similar
curves illustrate full recovery in plasma, the linear range shows assay
efficiency and the hook effect at 10× dilution indicates assay saturation.
(B) TNF levels in plasma after pMCAO. Plasma samples were obtained
30 minutes after pMCAO and measured in the indicated dilutions (100×,
10× and undiluted). As a positive control to ensure assay performance
TNF was spiked in control plasma (Calibrator diluent buffer, 10,000×,
1,000× and 100×) and as negative control plasma from a naïve control
mouse (100×, 10× and undiluted). No change in TNF in plasma
was observed 30 minutes after pMCAO. (C) TNF levels in plasma
after pMCAO. Plasma samples were obtained 6, 12 or 24 hours
after pMCAO and TNF levels were analyzed at the indicated dilutions
(10,000×, 1,000×, 100× and 10×). The TNF level was at background
levels and no change in TNF in plasma was observed at the indicated
time points after ischemia. Plasma inhibition was introduced in the
assay setup, demonstrated by lower signal in the high plasma
concentration compared to the buffer level. In (A), (B) and (C)
error bars indicate SD.

SP-D KO mice 5 days after ischemia as compared to
1 day, with no differences in the strength of the astroglial activation between genotypes (Figure 3). These findings suggest that SP-D has no major effect on the
astrocytic response to the ischemic insult.
Proseek analysis of TNF levels in plasma

The Proseek TNF assay performance and recovery was investigated in Calibrator diluent and mouse EDTA plasma.
Very similar curves were obtained, indicating a full recovery of the TNF in EDTA plasma samples (Figure 4A).
Assay efficacy was demonstrated by the linear range and a
so-called hook effect was observed at the highest concentrations (10× diluted), which is in accordance with the
proximity extension assay (PEA) [38]. The slightly lower
signal obtained in the mouse EDTA plasma could be attributed to a minor plasma inhibition of the antigen spikein measurements, which was not considered important
for the performance of the assay (Figure 4A).
The level of plasma TNF was determined in plasma
samples obtained from mice 30 minutes, and 6, 12 and
24 hours after pMCAO. The plasma samples obtained
30 minutes after pMCAO were compared with plasma
samples obtained from naïve control mice. The plasma
TNF level in the control mice was constant at background
level. The same low TNF level was observed for the plasma
sample taken 30 minutes after pMCAO (Figure 4B). The
antigen spike-in dose-response curve was included to ensure assay performance. To ensure that the low level of
TNF could not be ascribed to measuring at the incorrect
kinetic time point, we investigated plasma from 6, 12 and
24 hours after pMCAO. However, no effect of ischemia on

the plasma TNF level was observed, which suggests that induction of permanent focal cerebral ischemia does not
affect the systemic level of TNF in young adult mice
(Figure 4C).
Plasma SP-D levels remain low 1 and 5 days after focal
cerebral ischemia

Since SP-D is known to be synthesized by Clara cells
and type II pneumocytes, in addition to endothelial cells,
and potentially could diffuse or be translocated into the
circulation, we investigated whether SP-D was present in
elevated levels in plasma after pMCAO. Plasma was obtained from mice just prior to decapitation. However,
plasma SP-D levels were found to be very low both in
naïve WT mice and in WT mice at one and five days
after pMCAO (Table 2). This suggests that SP-D levels
are not increased in plasma after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in mice.
SP-D mRNA is expressed in cerebral artery cells in the
mouse

Next, we investigated SP-D production by brain resident
cells. We first investigated whole brain tissue using three
different SP-D primer sets. These primer sets were designed to cover different exon-exon junctions of SP-D
mRNA. Using this approach, we were able to detect SPD mRNA in lung and spleen tissue but we did not detect
any parenchymal SP-D mRNA expression in neither
normal nor ischemic brain (data not shown). Based on
previous findings of SP-D protein in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells [9,11,12], we then isolated
cerebral arteries, including the MCA, from both C57BL/6
mice (n = 2, inbred mouse strain) and NMRI mice (n = 2,
non-inbred mouse strain) in order to investigate whether
cerebral artery cells produce SP-D mRNA, which is not
picked up by whole brain analysis. We found that cerebral
artery cells did express SP-D mRNA, which was confirmed using all three primer sets (Figure 5, shown for primer set 3 only). The results using primer set 3 showed
that in the lungs from both C57BL/6 and NMRI mice,
2dd-Ct values for SP-D mRNA were 0.81 to 0.84, with
2dd-Ct values in cerebral arteries around 0.003 to 0.004,
and for aorta 0.0001 (Figure 5), whereas whole brain 2ddCt values were undetectable (data not shown). We found

that cerebral artery cells had a 40-fold higher SP-D mRNA
level than aortic cells, which have previously been shown
to express low levels of SP-D mRNA [9]. In comparison,
the level of SP-D mRNA in cerebral artery cells was 200fold lower than the level in the lung, which is a major site
of SP-D synthesis.
SP-D protein is expressed in vessels in normal appearing
and ischemic human brain tissue

Since we failed to detect SP-D by immunohistochemistry
in murine ischemic brain tissue (data not shown), we
turned to human tissue, where SP-D antibodies have
been used successfully in our hands [9] (Figure 6). Patient
material was chosen in order to cover an early time point
(<5 days, n = 2) and a later time point (>5 days, n = 2) after
ischemic stroke (Table 1). For comparison, SP-D expression was also analyzed in normal appearing brain tissue
from the same tissue blocks, where SP-D immunostaining
appeared confined to the endothelium lining the vessels
(Figure 6A). In the case of ischemic tissue, we found evidence that SP-D was expressed by vascular or vesselassociated cells in both peri-infarct and infarct in the
hippocampus, the temporal lobe, the internal capsule, and
the parietal lobe (Figure 6E-J). For verification of the specificity of the primary antibody, Clara cells and type II
pneumocytes in the lungs, known to produce SP-D, were
confirmed to be SP-D immunopositive (Figure 6C,D). Parallel sections stained for CD45, which is expressed on both
microglia and leukocytes, were included to allow us
to distinguish between normal appearing brain tissue

The results show that SP-D is expressed by vascular or
vessel-associated cells both in normal appearing and ischemic human brain tissue.

Discussion
There is increasing evidence that crosstalk between the
immune system in the brain and periphery contributes
to determine the long-term neurologic and neuropathologic outcome both in stroke models and in clinical
stroke [39,40]. Here we studied the effect of the collectin
SP-D, which is involved in systemic inflammation and
phagocytosis [41], on cerebral infarction and on postischemic inflammatory responses. Our findings of comparable infarct volumes in SP-D KO and WT mice at
both one and five days after surgery strongly suggests
that SP-D has no effect on cerebral infarction after permanent focal cerebral ischemia; however, the finding
does not rule out that SP-D might influence the outcome in reperfusion models of stroke. SP-D mRNA expression in the intact mouse brain was limited to the

cerebral vasculature, which is consistent with the initial
reports showing very low to undetectable levels of SP-D
mRNA in the normal mouse brain [42]. Furthermore,
there was no evidence of an upregulation of SP-D
mRNA by the parenchymal cells after the ischemic insult. Both sets of observations are consistent with our finding of SP-D expression by vascular or vessel-associated
cells both in the normal appearing and ischemic human
brain tissue.
In this study, we confirmed the absence of correlation
between TNF mRNA levels and infarct volume in the
WT mice at one day [30], and found evidence of a linear
correlation between TNF mRNA levels and infarct volume five days after induction of ischemia in the WT
mice, but not in the SP-D KO mice. The latter observation attracts attention since post-surgical day five coincides with the period of maximal tissue resorption
[26,43,44] and maximal expression of plasticity genes
[45]. Although, SP-D apparently has no effect of infarct
development after induction of permanent focal cerebral
ischemia, the finding of an altered TNF response in

Lambertsen et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:123
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/11/1/123

SP-D KO mice at day five indicates that SP-D modulates the microglial-macrophage TNF response to ischemia in WT mice in the late phase after induction of
ischemia. SP-D is known to bind TLR2 and TLR4, as
well as SHPS-1/SIRPα that are all expressed on and
linked to induction of TNF in microglia and macrophages and involved in stroke [20]. Since microglialmacrophage-produced TNF and SHPS-1/SIRPα are both
known to have neuroprotective and pro-regenerative functions [46], SP-D could potentially have indirect effects on
post-stroke neural plasticity. Furthermore, since SP-D
suppresses the clearance of apoptotic cells by binding to
SHPS-1/SIRPα [21], the expression of SP-D by vascular
and vessel-associated cells both in the murine and in the
human brain might potentially protect the vasculature,
while leaving the dying neurons and myelin debris accessible for clearance by the recruited macrophages and
microglia. Clarification of the putative role of SP-D in affecting infarct resolution and neural plasticity will require
additional experiments, ideally involving the use of models
of both permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia.
Systemic inflammation caused by infection is both associated with increased risk of developing a stroke and
with worse outcome after a stroke (review by [40]). A
frequent cause of systemic inflammation especially in
the elderly is lung infection, which is associated with a
massive increase in SP-D in the lung as well as in the
circulation [47]. This increase is likely due to translocation of SP-D from the lungs into the vascular system
[48]. In this study, we investigated whether surgically induced ischemic injury of the neocortex might result in
an increase in SP-D in the circulation. We found that
SP-D levels in plasma remained very low, beyond 5 ng/mL,
which corresponds to base-line levels [48], up until 1 day
after induction of ischemia, arguing against injury to the
skull and the neocortex affecting SP-D levels in the circulation. We also monitored plasma TNF in WT mice after ischemia and observed very low levels and no evidence of
any ischemia-induced increases up until one day after the
surgery. In combination with results by others, who failed
to show ischemia-induced increases in plasma TNF in mice
two and seven days after transient focal cerebral ischemia
[49] this suggests that plasma TNF, like plasma SP-D, is unaffected by the ischemic and surgical injury in young adult
mice [46]. This is, in the case of TNF, different from studies
of human stroke, where most but not all studies report an
elevation of serum TNF from 24 to 72 hours after stroke
onset (reviewed in [47]).
Although, we were unsuccessful with the immunohistochemical detection of SP-D in the murine brain, we
were able to convincingly show that SP-D mRNA is
expressed in higher levels in murine cerebral arteries
than in the murine aorta, and that SP-D is expressed in
the cerebral microvasculature both in normal appearing

Page 11 of 13

and in ischemic human brain tissue. The latter is consistent with our former demonstration of expression of
SP-D mRNA in human endothelial and smooth muscle
cells, and of a role of SP-D in atherogenesis [9]. This observation is not only relevant to stroke, but also to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, for which atherosclerosis is a
major risk factor.
We conclude that SP-D has no influence on infarct development after permanent focal cerebral ischemia, which
is consistent with undetectable production of SP-D by
parenchymal cells. The demonstration of SP-D production
in cerebral artery cells, however, is consistent with SP-D
influencing disease processes in the cerebral vasculature,
whereby SP-D may still play a role in stroke pathophysiology, in particular in reperfusion models of stroke.
