Dissecting Xuesaitong’s mechanisms on
preventing stroke based on the microarray and
connectivity map†

Elucidating action mechanisms of Chinese medicines has remained a challenging task due to the chemical
and biological complexity that needs to be resolved. In this study we applied a gene expression data and
connectivity map (CMAP) based approach to study action mechanisms of a Chinese medicine Xuesaitong
injection (XST) on preventing cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. XST is a standardized patent Chinese
medicine of Panax notoginseng roots and it has long been used for the effective prevention and treatment of stroke in China. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying
its effects against ischemic stroke. We first evaluated the effect of XST against ischemic stroke in an
ischemia–reperfusion rat animal model and dissected its mechanisms based on gene expression data of
injured brain. The results showed that treatment with XST significantly attenuated infarct area and histo-

Introduction
Chinese medicine has been developed through thousands of
years of empirical applications in China. It has made remarkable contributions to promoting the health and longevity of
human welfare.1,2 The clinical eﬃcacy of Chinese medicine
under various pathological conditions has been widely recognized and reported. However, the mechanisms of many Chinese
medicines remain elusive, despite enormous research eﬀorts
carried out in recent decades.3 One of the major reasons is
that Chinese medicine is a multiple component system and it
treats diseases with multiple targets, multiple pathways and
multiple actions.4 The vast chemical and biological complexity
of the action mechanisms needs to be revealed with systematic
approaches.

China.5–8 Xuesaitong injection (XST) is a prescription drug
made of Panax notoginseng and Panax notoginseng saponins
(PNSs) are its main active components.9 Ginsenosides Rg1,
Rb1, Re and Rd and notoginsenoside R1 were found to account
for B85% of the total compositions in XST in our previous
study.10 The major components are well quantified, controlled
and subjected to standardization.10 The effective clinical treatment of acute ischemia stroke by XST has been reported,11,12
although some reports may be limited by small sample
sizes.5,13 Potential mechanisms include attenuating the apoptosis, modulating inflammatory response of microglia,14–16 but
a systematic study on the mechanisms of XST is still missing.
The development of a transcriptional omics approach
provides an opportunity to simultaneously analyze a large
number of genes associated with disease and complex therapeutic eﬀects of medicines, e.g. Chinese medicine.4,17,18 The
analysis of genes modulated by Chinese medicine may provide
insights into their molecular mechanisms. The connectivity map
(CMAP), a similarity-based method, is one of the most eﬀective
tools for the mode-of-action study. The CMAP is a systematic
approach developed for the discovery of functional connections
among diseases, genes and drugs through the genome-wide
transcriptional expression data and the transitory feature of
common gene-expression changes.19 The CMAP contains more
than 7000 expression profiles representing 1309 compounds.

Paper

Drugs aﬀecting common gene expressions can be identified
through CMAP analysis, which provides a useful tool for
discovering the mode of action of drugs, such as Chinese
medicine.20–23 For example, Wen et al.22 applied the combined
microarray and CMAP approach in identifying molecular
mechanisms of Si-Wu-Tang.
To evaluate the eﬀect and mechanisms of XST on preventing
stroke, a rat animal model was produced with a middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) procedure and treated with XST for
seven days. In this study, XST’s eﬀects on infarction area and
histological damage in MCAO rats were studied firstly. Then,
the gene expression profile in injured brains was also measured. A combined approach of the pathway and CMAP analysis
was further used to identify molecular mechanisms of XST. As a
result, anti-inflammation and anti-platelet coagulation were
identified as the major mechanisms of XST against ischemic
stroke. We demonstrated an approach in identifying molecular
mechanisms of Chinese medicine by combining microarray
data and the CMAP approach.

Materials and methods
Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from WeitongLihua Experimental Animal Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC, China) and the experimental animal
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical
Committee of Tianjin Centre for Drug Safety Assessment (Tianjin,
China).
Drugs and reagents
XST lyophilized powder for injection, one of the major types of
XST Injection used in clinical practices, was manufactured by
Heilongjiang Zhenbaodao pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Heilongjiang,
China). It was dissolved in saline before experiment. 2,3,5Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was purchased from Beijing
Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. Rat thromboxane B2
(TXB2), 6-keto PGF1a enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) Kits were from Bio-Swamp.
Experimental protocol
Rats were subjected to MCAO and reperfusion.24,25 Briefly,
animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, neck vessels were
exposed and branches of the right external carotid artery were
isolated. The right middle cerebral artery was occluded with a
0.25 mm nylon monofilament by inserting it through right
external carotid artery to produce the cerebral focal ischemia.
Two hours after occlusion, the inserted filament was slowly
withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The incision on the neck was
closed. Fifteen Sham-operated rats underwent the same surgical procedures but without the insertion of the nylon filament
into the inner carotid. Successful MCAO rats were randomly
divided into four groups (with fifteen rats in each group). Three
doses of XST were given to rats: 20 mg kg1, 40 mg kg1 and

3034 | Mol. BioSyst., 2015, 11, 3033--3039

Molecular BioSystems

80 mg kg1 for low (XSTL), medium (XSTM), and high (XSTH)
concentrations, respectively. Sham and Model groups received
an equivalent vehicle. All the treatments were given once daily
with intravenous injection consecutively for seven days.
Infarct area measurement and brain histology
At the end of the experiment, rats were anesthetized with chloral
hydrate (360 mg kg1), arterial blood samples were collected at
aorta abdominalis. Rat brains were quickly removed. Ten rat
brains in each group were frozen at 20 1C and sectioned into
2 mm-thick coronal slices. Slices were incubated for 10 min at
37 1C in 2% TTC solution in phosphate buﬀered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4). And in each sample, the infarction area ratio was
calculated by dividing the total infarction area by the total
slice area.
The infarcted hemispheres of remaining five rat brains in
each group were divided into two parts: one for the histological
test, and one for the microarray experiment. The hemispheres
for the histological test were fixed in 10% formaldehyde
solution, and embedded in paraﬃn. The paraﬃn sections
(5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and
analyzed by light microscopy.
Microarray experiment and data analysis
We profiled the gene expression in the infarcted hemispheres
of Sham, Model and XSTH groups (n = 5) using the Aﬀymetrix
Rat 230 2.0 Array. The detailed procedure of the microarray
experiment was the same as described previously.4 The dataset
as CEL files was deposited to GEO and the access number is
GSE61616. Global scaling normalization of the expression data
was performed with Median Scaling Normalization in ArrayTrack 3.5.026 using a target median value of 1000. Genes
associated with stroke were obtained from databases including
SIDD, DISEASES, DisGeNet, MALACARDS, DGA with keywords
‘Brain infarction’, ‘Ischemic stroke’, ‘Stroke’, ‘Stroke, Ischemic’,
‘Brain Ischemia’, or ‘‘Cerebrovascular Accident’’. The fold
change (FC) of stroke related genes between Model and Sham
(as FC1) was calculated, as well as between Model and XSTH
(as FC2). The Reverse Rate (RR) was also calculated as previously
reported4 and genes with RR 4 0 mean they were positively
regulated by XST. Genes with FC1 4 1.5, FC2 4 1.2 and RR 4 0
were defined as diﬀerentially expressed genes by XST. The list of
diﬀerentially expressed genes was imported to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database through ArrayTrack 3.5.0 for functional enrichment analysis.
To better understand the mechanisms of XST, the similarities of the gene expression profile between XST and chemical
drugs were measured through the CMAP (http://www.broadin
stitute.org/cMAP/) reference database (Build 02). The diﬀerentially expressed genes were divided into two parts, one for upregulation and the other for down-regulation by XST. In order
to query the CMAP, the genes were converted to probe sets in
the chip type Aﬀymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HT U133A
Array. Then they were used as queries to search the CMAP. The
similarity between XST and a CMAP instance is measured by an
enrichment score, ranging from 1 to 1 and a permutation

Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
The transcripts for six representative diﬀerent genes were quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was obtained from the microarray
experiment. Template RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative expressions
of mRNAs were detected using the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR
Kit (Qiagen). In order to normalize variations in mRNA extraction
and cDNA synthesis, the expression of beta-actin (Actb) was
measured simultaneously. All primer sets were purchased from
Takara (Dalian, China) and Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI,
Shenzhen, China). Triplicate aliquot reactions were carried out
for each sample at 95 1C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95 1C for 10 seconds and combined annealing/
extension at 60 1C for 30 seconds. Data were quantified using the
2-delta CT method.27,28 Primers used for real-time PCR were
shown in Table 1.
Measurement of platelet aggregation and TXB2 and 6-keto
PGF1a
Arterial blood samples were collected and anti-coagulated with
3.2% of sodium citrate (ratio 9 : 1). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP),
obtained by centrifuging whole blood for 10 minutes at
800 rpm, was stimulated with ADP of final concentration about
4 mmol L1. Platelet aggregation was monitored by light transmission in a Chrono-log 540 aggregometer (Chrono-log Corp.,
Haverton, PA, USA) with continuous stirring at 37 1C. The
100% line was set using platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and the
0 baseline established with PRP (adjusted from 3.5  108 platelets
per ml up to 4  108 platelets per ml). PPP was prepared by
centrifuging whole blood for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. TXB2 and
6-keto PGF1a levels were measured according to manufacturer’s
instructions.

another 6 h, followed by treatment with LPS (50 ng ml1) for an
additional 24 h. Indo was a positive control. The amount of NO
production in the medium was detected with the Griess reaction
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The absorbance of
the mixture at 550 nm was determined using a microplate reader,
and nitrite concentration was determined using a dilution of
sodium nitrite as a standard.
Statistical analysis
All values are given as mean  standard deviation. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS software. One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to compare group variables, comparisons of parameters between two groups were performed with the
least significant diﬀerences (LSD) or the Games-Howell test.29,30
Diﬀerences were considered significant if the p-value was less
than 0.05.

Results
XST reduced infarct size in brains
No infarct area was observed in the Sham group. In contrast,
noticeable infarct areas were observed in the Model group as
evidenced by a large TTC-negatively-stained area in cortex and
striatum. As compared to the Model group, intravenous administration of XST protected rat brains against MCAO injury to a significant degree (as shown in Fig. 1). XST at 40, and 80 mg kg1
significantly reduced the infarct size by 25.2% ( p o 0.05) and
26.9% ( p o 0.05) in comparison to the Model group.

In vitro validation of the anti-inflammation action of XST
RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture
Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
and cultured at 37 1C in 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% heatinactivated FBS. The RAW264.7 cells were plated at a density of
3  104 per well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells
were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of XST (2.5, 5, 10,

cavitation of cytoplasm were ameliorated by XST treatment.

Eﬀect of XST on cortex histology in MCAO rats
Fig. 2 showed the results of histological examination of the
cortex of right brain in diﬀerent groups. Compared with the
Sham group, distinct alterations occurred in MCAO rats,
including abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, karyopyknosis,
swelling and damage of neurons, cavitation of cytoplasm. All
of these alterations were ameliorated by treatment with XST,
especially in the XSTH group.
Microarray data analysis
1205 stroke related genes were obtained from five databases.
However, only 212 genes were identified as XST significantly
regulated genes against stroke in our setting. Detailed gene lists
were provided in Table S1 (ESI†).
To gain deeper biological insights, the genes were further
categorized into functional pathways in the KEGG database.
There were 24 KEGG pathways significantly enriched with
fisher p values less than 0.05. The top 15 significantly impacted
KEGG pathways were listed in Table 2. Among them, cytokine–

receptor interaction, focal adhesion and ECM–receptor interaction were correlated with adhesion. Four pathways: complement and coagulation cascades, Toll-like receptor signaling
pathway, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and intestinal
immune network for IgA production were classified into
immune system/cellular processes, which were involved in
immune responses, inflammatory response and coagulation.
Arachidonic acid metabolism is closely related to the production of inflammatory factors and blood coagulation factors. The
MAPK signaling pathway and the p53 signaling pathway have
important functions, proliferation and apoptosis. In summary,
inflammatory immune response, coagulation and apoptosis
were the major mechanisms of XST against stroke based on
pathway analysis.

were used as the query to the CMAP. Eighteen drugs with
p-values o 0.05 and a positive enrichment score were found by
the CMAP (Table 3). Among them, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug glafenine and parthenolide31 are anti-inflammatory
agents. Piperlongumine has an anti-plate aggregation eﬀect.32
Pivampicillin, sulfaphenazole, sulfathiazole, nifuroxazide, parthenolide33 and caﬀeic acid34 were all antibacterials. Papaverine and
difenidol could dilate blood vessel. b-Blocker pronetalol and
cardiac glycoside ouabain are involved in the regulation of heart
muscle function.
Real-time RT-PCR validation of selected genes
To validate the findings from the microarray data set, the
expression levels of six representative genes were confirmed
with RT-PCR. We found that Fabp4, Plau, Ltc4s, Igf1, Spp1, and
Hmox1 were highly up-regulated by MCAO, and suppressed by

XST treatment, which showed similar patterns with microarray
data. The FCs in the microarray and RT-PCR were listed in
Table 4.
XST decreased platelet aggregation and ameliorated the
changes in TXB2 and 6-keto PGF1a
XST significantly decreased platelet aggregation in a dosedependent manner as compared with the Model group (Fig. 3).
XST at 20, 40, and 80 mg kg1 reduced the maximum platelet
aggregation rate by 10.2%, 18.2% and 22.8%. After MCAO, the
serum level of TXB2 increased significantly as compared with
sham-operated rats ( p o 0.05) and 6-keto PGF1a decreased. XST
(20, 40, and 80 mg kg1) ameliorated these changes in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4).
In vitro validation of the anti-inflammation action of XST
To evaluate the inhibitory eﬀect of XST on LPS-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines, the amount of NO production
was determined by the amount of nitrite, a stable metabolite of
NO. As shown in Fig. 5, RAW264.7 macrophages produced 0.35 
0.11 mM nitrite in the resting state. After LPS stimulation for 24 h,
NO production increased to 6.98  0.50 mM. XST inhibited the
nitrite production in a dose-dependent manner. 200 mg ml1
of XST could suppress the NO production stimulated by LPS
completely. XST can inhibit NO production significantly at
50 mg ml1.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death in China and
worldwide with high morbidity, disability and death rates.35,36
Ischemic stroke accounted for almost eighty five percent of all
strokes.37 The tissue plasminogen activator is the only
approved therapy for ischemic stroke treatment.38,39 But less
than 10% of patients received this therapy because of its narrow
therapeutic time window and the risk of intracranial hemorrhagic transformation.40–43 Therefore, discovering safe and
effective drugs and a treatment approach for stroke to restore
neural function and reduce disabilities with a wide therapeutic
window is an important but daunting task.44 Chinese medicine
would be an important resource for stroke treatment and new
drug development. Among them, an attractive one is Panax

with CMAP analysis. First, we demonstrated that XST was able
to attenuate ischemia–reperfusion induced brain injury. After

protective effects of XST.

factor and it plays a key role in the occurrence of ischemic
stroke. Therefore anti-plate aggregation is one of the important
mechanisms for XST in stroke treatment, ginsenoside Rg1
could be one of the eﬀective ingredients.46,47
Inflammation is an essential process in ischemic stroke pathology. Activated macrophages induce severe inflammation which
causes cerebral swelling.48 In this study, inflammation and adhesion is another important mechanism of XST against stroke. The
class of inflammation-related pathways was the largest in all pathways enriched by significant genes. Two anti-inflammatory drugs
were significantly identified in CMAP analysis. We further validated
the anti-inflammatory action in vitro, as XST inhibited the inflammatory factor in RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and
a high dose of XST could prevent NO production completely. The
results confirmed the anti-inflammatory eﬀect of XST. Several
reports49–51 revealed that ginsenoside Rd might be involved in
the anti-inflammatory effect in neuroprotection after focal cerebral
ischemia, and it would be one of the effective ingredients.
Interestingly, CMAP analysis also identified several antiinfection drugs being similar to XST, which needs further studies
to validate the anti-infection eﬀect of XST and its contribution to
stroke treatment. A meta-analysis in 2013 demonstrated that 30%
of acute stroke patients have complicated infection.52 Antiinfection is a very important aspect in stroke treatment.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an eﬀective
approach in identifying molecular mechanisms of XST against
