Abstract—The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas axis represents a promising target for inducing
stroke neuroprotection. Here, we explored stroke-induced changes in expression and activity of endogenous angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 and other system components in Sprague–Dawley rats. To evaluate the clinical feasibility of
treatments that target this axis and that may act in synergy with stroke-induced changes, we also tested the neuroprotective
effects of diminazene aceturate, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activator, administered systemically post stroke.
Among rats that underwent experimental endothelin-1–induced ischemic stroke, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
activity in the cerebral cortex and striatum increased in the 24 hours after stroke. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 activity was decreased within 4 hours post stroke, but rebounded to reach higher than baseline levels 3 days post
stroke. Treatment after stroke with systemically applied diminazene resulted in decreased infarct volume and improved
neurological function without apparent increases in cerebral blood flow. Central infusion of A-779, a Mas receptor
antagonist, resulted in larger infarct volumes in diminazene-treated rats, and central infusion of the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 inhibitor MLN-4760 alone worsened neurological function. The dynamic alterations of the
protective angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 pathway after stroke suggest that it may be a favorable therapeutic target.
Indeed, significant neuroprotection resulted from poststroke angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activation, likely via Mas
signaling in a blood flow–independent manner. Our findings suggest that stroke therapeutics that target the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas axis may interact cooperatively with endogenous stroke-induced changes,
lending promise to their further study as neuroprotective agents.  (Hypertension. 2015;66:141-148. DOI: 10.1161/

troke, a disease for which hypertension remains the leading
modifiable risk factor, is a devastating reality each year for
many millions of people worldwide and is a leading cause of death
and disability.1 The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) holds promise as a potential target for novel stroke therapies, especially so
with the recent discovery of a counter-regulatory arm of the RAS
that exerts opposite effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling via activation of other receptors, including
the angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) receptor Mas. Ang-(1–7) is
formed from angiotensin II by the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).2 Further characterization of the actions of
ACE2 in various pathologies has expanded our view of the therapeutic potential of small-molecule activators of this pathway.2
Significant research effort in the field of neuroprotective
stroke therapies has been aimed at the discovery of novel treatments that may be administered to salvage penumbral tissue that

is uniquely vulnerable to collapse.3 The ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas
pathway has been highlighted as a promising target for induction
of stroke neuroprotection,4 and has proven efficacy in reducing
infarct size and improving neurological function in preclinical
models of ischemic5–11 and hemorrhagic stroke.12 Stroke neuroprotection has been demonstrated in both young5,6 and aged10
animals, and methods for activating the axis have included
direct intracerebroventricular administration of Ang-(1–7),5,7,11
delivery of ACE2-primed endothelial progenitor cells,8 and neuronal ACE2 overexpression.9 Pharmacological activation of this
axis has recently become more feasible with the identification
of diminazene aceturate, trade name Berenil, as an activator of
ACE213. We have shown that when given by intracerebroventricular infusion before, during, and after stroke, diminazene
reduced infarct size in rats, an effect that was reversed by coadministration with Mas antagonist A-779.5

An important consideration for the continued study of the
therapeutic effects of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis in stroke
is the characterization of changes that occur in the endogenous
components of this system during stroke in the absence of targeted interventions. It has been recently reported that expression of this protective axis is altered after stroke in the rat
cerebral cortex14 and rostral ventrolateral medulla15 although
it is unknown whether ACE2 activity levels are affected or
whether this is accompanied by changes in the deleterious
ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. Our objective was to test whether
components of the RAS, including the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/
Mas pathway, are altered in rats after stroke. Furthermore, we
assessed the hypothesis that poststroke systemic administration of an ACE2 activator, diminazene, in rats would result in
neuroprotection.

Results
Effect of Stroke on ACE2 in Rat Brain and Serum
Ischemic stroke induction, as described in experiment 1 of the
Materials and Methods in the online-only Data Supplement,
resulted in significantly increased ACE2 activity in the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the stroke when compared with
control activity levels from sham-operated rats at 4 hours,

12 hours, and 1 day after ischemia (Figure 1A), along with
an increase at 12 hours in the ipsilateral striatum compared
with both shams and contralateral striatum (Figure 1B). At 12
hours, ACE2 activity in the contralateral cortical samples was
also significantly increased compared with respective sham
levels (Figure 1A). ACE2 activity levels in the cerebral cortex
and striatum had returned to sham levels by 3 days (Figure 1A
and 1B). There was not a significant change in ACE2 mRNA
levels in the ipsilateral cortex either 1 or 3 days after ischemia
(Figure 1C). Stroke resulted in an initial minor decrease of
ACE2 activity in rat serum measured at 4 hours post stroke
when compared with normalized prestroke levels, followed by
a significant rebound increase 3 days post stroke (Figure 1D).

Effect of Stroke on Other RAS and Related
Components in Ischemic Cerebral Cortex
ACE2 is thought to exert neuroprotective effects, in part,
via conversion of Ang II to Ang-(1–7), which subsequently
binds and signals through the Ang-(1–7) receptor Mas.
Therefore, we assessed the impact of stroke on mRNA levels of Mas and also of the neuroprotective AT2R, and did
not find significant differences at 1 day after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; Figure 2A). In addition to
these protective arms of the RAS, components of the classical ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway were evaluated. Compared
with sham, there was an increase in ACE mRNA levels in
the ipsilateral cortex, but no change in AT1R mRNA was

observed (Figure 2A). As expected, we also observed
increased mRNA levels of LCN2 (lipocalin 2), a marker
of astrocyte activation, and CD11b, a marker of activated
microglia (Figure 2B). We further evaluated the levels of
tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE, also
named ADAM17), an enzyme that forms soluble ACE2
by cleaving ACE2 from its membrane-bound form via its
sheddase activity, in samples from the ipsilateral cortex and
found a significant increase of TACE mRNA but not activity
at 1 day post stroke relative to shams (Figure 2C and 2D).
Interestingly, although TACE mRNA expression levels were
not significantly different between sham and stroke groups
at 3 days, TACE activity was significantly decreased in
samples from the ischemic cortex at this time point. Serum
TACE activity was not different between sham and stroke
groups at 1 day post stroke (data not shown).
To further characterize the stroke-induced changes in Mas
expression in neurons and other brain cells, we used immunohistochemical staining to label NeuN and Mas immunoreactive cells. Representative fluorescence micrographs
(Figure 3A) show NeuN and Mas staining within the stroke
penumbra from sham and stroke rats 1 day post stroke.
Semiquantitative analysis of immunofluorescent staining
showed that the percentage of fractional area of both NeuN
and Mas immunopositive staining in the ipsilateral cerebral
cortex was significantly decreased compared with sham rat
cerebral cortex (Figure 3B and 3C).

Neuroprotective Effects of Poststroke
Administration of Peripheral Diminazene, an ACE2
Activator
The observed increase in ACE2 activity in the ipsilateral
cerebral cortex after stroke represents a promising target for
inducing stroke neuroprotection. We have previously reported
that prestroke activation of central ACE2 using diminazene
results in significant neuroprotection when administered by
intracerebroventricular infusion before, during, and after
endothelin-1 MCAO.5 Here, we tested a more clinically relevant treatment protocol, as described in experiment 2 of the
Materials and Methods in the online-only Data Supplement,
which used poststroke intraperitoneal injections of drug or
vehicle at 4 hours, 1 day, and 2 day after MCAO, times that

overlap with endogenous stroke-induced changes to ACE2/
Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis (Figures 1–3).
To identify the maximally efficacious dose of diminazene
for poststroke peripheral administration, we performed a set
of dose–response experiments in rats. Stroke resulted in large
infarct volumes among vehicle-treated versus sham-operated
rats. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, infarct volume
was significantly decreased by poststroke intraperitoneal
injections of diminazene at doses of 0.75, 2.5, and 7.5 mg/kg,
but not of 15 mg/kg (Figure 4A). The accompanying strokeinduced neurological deficits were significantly attenuated by
7.5 mg/kg diminazene at 1 day (Figure 4B and 4C) but not at 3
days (data not shown). The data presented in Figure 4D demonstrate that poststroke administration of diminazene (7.5 mg/
kg, IP) at 4 hours, 1 day, and 2 days resulted in significantly
higher levels of serum ACE2 activity at 2 days post stroke
with a similar although not significant increase at 3 days.
On the basis of these collective results and the finding that
intraperitoneal administration did not affect levels of baseline
blood pressure or cerebral blood flow (CBF, Figure S1 in the
online-only Data Supplement), we used the 7.5 mg/kg dose
for all subsequent experiments.
We assessed the Mas-dependency of the neuroprotection
induced by poststroke intraperitoneal diminazene injections
by chronically coadministering the Mas antagonist A-779
or 0.9% sterile saline vehicle via the intracerebroventricular route. Blockade of central Mas receptors by infusion of
A-779 in rats cotreated with poststroke peripheral diminazene resulted in significantly larger infarct sizes compared with
saline infusion (Figure 4E).
To examine the role of endogenous central ACE2 in stroke,
we infused MLN-4760, an ACE2 inhibitor, via the intracerebroventricular route for 5 days before and 3 days after stroke
in the absence of any treatment. This resulted in significantly
worse neurological function at 4 hours and 3 days post stroke
without significantly increasing infarct volume (Figure 4F
and 4G).

Effect of Diminazene on CBF During Baseline
and Stroke
Ang-(1–7) has vasodilatory actions,2 which may potentially
contribute to the neuroprotection induced by ACE2 activation.

To test its effect on CBF, we administered diminazene to rats
at neuroprotective doses during endothelin-1–induced MCAO,
not poststroke, as described in experiments 3 and 4 of the
Materials and Methods in the online-only Data Supplement.
Relative CBF was not increased by diminazine during stroke
when compared with control as measured by laser Doppler
flowmetry and ≤4 hours post stroke (Figure 5A). Also, there
was not an observed increase in the baseline levels of absolute
CBF, as assessed by the microsphere injection method, among
rats chronically treated by intracerebroventricular infusion
with diminazene (Figure 5B) when compared with salineinfused rats.

Discussion
This study aimed to assess endogenous poststroke changes
within the RAS, with a focus on ACE2 activity, and to test the
neuroprotective efficacy of poststroke activation of ACE2 by
systemic administration of diminazene that might work synergistically with changes in the endogenous RAS. We found
significant increases of endogenous ACE2 activity, but not
expression, within the ischemic cerebral cortex and striatum
of rats during the first 24 hours after stroke, whereas serum
ACE2 activity levels were initially decreased, followed by
rebound increases. At 1 day after stroke, levels of immunoreactive Mas were significantly decreased in the ischemic
penumbra, and mRNA levels of the of deleterious RAS component ACE were increased. Administration of poststroke
diminazene resulted in significant neuroprotection, as well as
increased serum ACE2 activity. Finally, studies of the effect

of diminazene on CBF suggest that this protection may not be
associated with increased cerebral perfusion.
An increasing number of studies indicate that activation of
the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis is neuroprotective in stroke.16
Although these studies provide an essential foundation, there
are several limitations that our current design helps to address.
First, changes in expression and activity of the endogenous components of this pathway in the brain after stroke
warranted further investigation. The recent demonstration
of increases in levels of ACE2, Ang-(1–7), and Mas in the
48 hours after stroke in the ischemic cerebral cortex of rats
was an important first look.14 A second study of transient
MCAO in rats that examined axis components in the rostral ventrolateral medulla showed slightly different findings in that region, with decreases in Ang-(1–7) and Mas
at 1 day after stroke.15 In light of these findings, our results,
which show an increase in ACE2 activity in the ischemic
cortex (Figure 1A) but a decrease in Mas immunoreactivity
(Figure 3C), are intriguing. The reductions in immunoreactive Mas observed in penumbral regions of the ischemic
cortex at 1 day after stroke agreed with findings from the
rostral ventrolateral medulla 15 and may be because of an
overall decrease in penumbral Mas+ cortical neurons, as
immunostaining of neuronal nuclear marker NeuN was
decreased at this time point (Figure 3B and 3C). Additional
work is needed to clarify the various changes that we and
others have observed. It is likely that the difference in the
stroke models, transient versus permanent MCAO, plays a
distinctive role in the induction of RAS components. Our

data showing increased ACE2 activity in the cerebral cortex support the overall consensus that stroke activates the
protective axis.
Second, in all but one of the previous studies, the treatment conditions were started before stroke onset, either by
genetic modification or prestroke administration of activating compounds. Using a more clinically relevant protocol,
Chen et al8 were the first to use a poststroke treatment protocol to study ACE2-mediated neuroprotection by delivering
endothelial progenitor cells, with or without ACE2 priming,
by tail vein injection starting 2 hours after stroke in mice.
Because these cells were protective even in the absence of
ACE2 priming, and because ACE2 enhanced their beneficial effects, the isolated effects of activating the ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas pathway after stroke onset were unclear. Here,
we administered an ACE2 activator by peripheral injection starting at 4 hours after stroke onset. This allowed for
assessment of therapeutic efficacy in a setting that overlaps
favorably with the 4.5-hour treatment window for the delivery of tissue-type plasminogen activator to human stroke
victims, as well as the endogenous stroke-induced changes
to the RAS (Figures 1–3). It is also relevant that systemic
(Figure 4A–4C) and central5 administration of diminazene
demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy, as intravenous drug

administration is a preferred route in humans in emergent
settings. There is evidence to indicate that peripheral diminazene can cross the intact blood–brain barrier,17 but in the

146  Hypertension  July 2015
setting of stroke, well-characterized barrier leakiness allows
many compounds to cross.16
A third limitation of previously published studies that
we can now begin to address involves the scarcity of data
describing the ACE2/Ang-(1–7) /Mas axis in human stroke.
Higher levels of ACE2 were found among patients who
experienced cardioembolic stroke versus other stroke subtypes18 although baseline or control ACE2 levels were not
assessed for comparison. It has also been shown that ACE2
gene polymorphisms may be associated with increased risk
for stroke.19 Serum measures of protective RAS components
are limited, but direct assessment of human serum ACE2
activity holds promise as a clinical marker in stroke. Our
study is the first to assess ACE2 enzymatic activity in animal serum after stroke (Figure 1D). It is encouraging for the
translational potential of the animal data that the changes
after stroke in ACE2 activity in rat serum (Figure 1D) show
a similar pattern to changes we have observed in preliminary studies using human serum obtained from patients
with stroke (unpublished data). Although human studies
of treatments that target the Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis have not
been performed in stroke, it has been shown that application of recombinant human ACE2 in healthy volunteers is
well tolerated,20 making plausible the idea of future studies
in patients with stroke.
Since the recent indication that diminazene activates
ACE2,13 it has been shown to have efficacy in treating a
variety of inflammatory diseases, including stroke.5 We
are the first to show that poststroke administration of this
small-molecule activator results in significant neuroprotection (Figure 4A–C). Importantly, a recent report questioned
whether diminazene activates ACE2, showing that it had no
effect when incubated in vitro with recombinant ACE2 and
ex vivo with kidney lysates.21 We found similar results in
unpublished experiments using recombinant human ACE2
and lysates of cerebral cortex. However, our assays of serum
ACE2 activity in animals that received systemic diminazene over the course of several days after stroke revealed
significant increases in serum ACE2 activity (Figure 4E), a
finding similar to that from a study of diminazene in myocardial infarction.22 Diminazene may only increase ACE2
activity in vivo over a period of time or under conditions
of disease or stress through as yet undiscovered effects on
transcription, translation, or protein modification of ACE2
or related molecules. Regardless, the observed increase in
ACE2 activity implies an increase in Ang-(1–7) generation
and subsequent Mas signaling as a result of poststroke injections of diminazene, which is further validated by our data
showing significantly worse infarct volume with coadministration of A-779 (Figure 4D). The vasodilatory action of
Ang-(1–7) was suggested to contribute to its neuroprotective effects in stroke,16 but our data do not indicate that diminazene increases regional CBF during endothelin-1 MCAO
or absolute CBF during baseline conditions (Figure 5A and
5B). Nonetheless, Ang-(1–7) may still act to increase perfusion at the level of the microcirculation in such a way that
it is not detected by our measures of CBF. Other potential
non–ACE2-mediated effects of diminazene, specifically
those that may independently reduce inflammation,17 cannot

be ruled out as contributing to the neuroprotective effects
we have observed. Because the current study is limited to
exploring the neuroprotective benefits of targeting this axis
in the acute and subacute phase of ischemic stroke, there
remains the important question of the impact of such treatments on longer term outcomes and late mortality. We anticipate that future studies in this area will address these and
other translationally relevant questions.
Few studies have examined the effect of stroke on the
induction of components of the classical RAS. It has been
reported that Ang II levels are increased in the stroke cortex
1 day after stroke,23 and others have shown Ang II to upregulate ACE, AT1R, and TACE and decrease ACE2 expression,24,25 which might account for some of the changes that
we have observed 1 day post stroke (Figures 1C and 2A and
2D). The role of TACE as an ACE2 sheddase has received
recent attention as a possible contributing factor to the
development of neurogenic hypertension, where it has been
hypothesized that TACE-mediated shedding impairs brain
ACE2 compensatory activity.26 Along these lines, evidence
from a study in cell culture showed that Ang II–induced
proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound ACE2 was mediated by increased activity of TACE, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma ACE2 activity,27 presumably
as a result of an increase in soluble ACE2. Our findings that
show significantly increased expression of TACE mRNA
in the cortex (Figure 2C) coinciding with early rebound
increases in serum ACE2 activity starting at 1 day after
stroke (Figure 1D) suggest that brain ACE2, once cleaved
from the membrane, may move into to the circulation after
stroke-induced blood–brain barrier breakdown. This seems
unlikely to completely account for the increased serum
ACE2 activity at 3 days after stroke because the levels of
brain TACE activity are significantly attenuated by that time
(Figure 2D). Other explanations for the observed poststroke
changes in serum ACE2 activity levels (Figure 1D) include
alterations in the release of soluble ACE2 from the membrane of endothelial cells.28 Evidence is not sufficient to
positively identify what signaling processes could initiate
such alterations in ACE2 shedding after stroke, but it seems
plausible that Ang II, which has been shown to increase
TACE,27 is involved. Another explanation incorporates bone
marrow–derived hematopoietic cells as a potential source
of soluble ACE2. In atherosclerotic plaques, ACE2 is
expressed in CD34+ cells, a marker for endothelial or hematopoietic progenitor cells. Evidence suggests that activation
of mononuclear cells leads to an increase of ACE229 and of
TACE,30 which could result in increased shedding of ACE2
from activated leukocytes. Furthermore, levels of CD34+
cells in peripheral blood after stroke in humans may follow
a similar pattern to that observed in serum ACE2 activity
(Figure 2D) with an initial decrease followed by a rebound
increase.31 Taken together, these findings suggest that ACE2
shedding from brain, endothelial, or activated hematopoietic cells may contribute to changes in serum ACE2 activity after stroke. The physiological relevance of changes in
serum ACE2 activity is not clear,2 but the evidence seems to
indicate that it is closely linked with the activity of TACE as
regulated by Ang II signaling.

Perspectives
The characterization of ACE2-mediated protection in a variety of cardiovascular diseases,2 including hypertension2 and
stroke,7 has opened a promising avenue for development of
novel treatments, which will rely on a thorough characterization of pathophysiologic changes in the RAS. In this study,
we characterized endogenous changes in this pathway in the
hours and days after stroke in rats. Future work in this area
may deepen our understanding of the cell subtype-specific
regulation of stroke-induced changes in protective and deleterious RAS components, as well as the physiological significance of changes in systemic versus central ACE2 activity.
Our results also provide the first evidence that activation of
ACE2 by peripheral administration of a small-molecule drug
after stroke is neuroprotective, which adds to an already compelling body of evidence that indicates great promise for the
clinical potential of pharmaceutical formulations that target
ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas in stroke.

Novelty and Significance
What Is New?

•	 This is the first study to characterize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) activity after stroke.
•	 We tested noninvasive administration of an ACE2 activator beginning
after stroke as a clinically relevant approach.
What Is Relevant?

•	 The finding of stroke-induced changes within the ACE2 pathway is an
important step for understanding ways it can best be targeted using
potential stroke treatments.

•	 The discovery of neuroprotection by giving an ACE2 activator after stroke
is compelling evidence for the continued study of this pathway toward
clinical application.

Summary
Stroke resulted in dynamic changes of ACE2 activity in brain and
serum from rats. Poststroke systemic administration of an ACE2
activator resulted in improved infarct size and neurological function, likely by activation of Mas, the Ang-(1–7) receptor.
