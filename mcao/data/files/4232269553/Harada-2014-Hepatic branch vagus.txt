Abstract
Orexin-A (a neuropeptide in the hypothalamus) plays an important role in many physiological functions, including the
regulation of glucose metabolism. We have previously found that the development of post-ischemic glucose intolerance is
one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage, which is suppressed by hypothalamic orexin-A. Other reports have shown
that the communication system between brain and peripheral tissues through the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic,
parasympathetic and vagus nerve) is important for maintaining glucose and energy metabolism. The aim of this study was
to determine the involvement of the hepatic vagus nerve on hypothalamic orexin-A-mediated suppression of post-ischemic
glucose intolerance development and ischemic neuronal damage. Male ddY mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. Intrahypothalamic orexin-A (5 pmol/mouse) administration significantly suppressed the
development of post-ischemic glucose intolerance and neuronal damage on day 1 and 3, respectively after MCAO. MCAOinduced decrease of hepatic insulin receptors and increase of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes on day 1 after was reversed
to control levels by orexin-A. This effect was reversed by intramedullary administration of the orexin-1 receptor antagonist,
SB334867, or hepatic vagotomy. In the medulla oblongata, orexin-A induced the co-localization of cholin acetyltransferase
(cholinergic neuronal marker used for the vagus nerve) with orexin-1 receptor and c-Fos (activated neural cells marker).
These results suggest that the hepatic branch vagus nerve projecting from the medulla oblongata plays an important role in
the recovery of post-ischemic glucose intolerance and mediates a neuroprotective effect by hypothalamic orexin-A.

precise regulation of liver glucose output is necessary to ensure
adequate availability of energy sources for the brain.
The orexin family (orexin-A and orexin-B) are hypothalamic
neuropeptides [15] possessing many physiological functions,
including arousal and energy metabolism such as glucose
metabolism, feeding behavior, sleep and wakefulness [16,17].
Importantly, orexin-containing axons are widely distributed in the
CNS, particularly in areas involved in autonomic regulation
[16,18,19]. Intra-hypothalamic administration of orexin-A enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by activating the
sympathetic nervous system [20]. Furthermore, hyperglycemia in
diabetic mice is suppressed by intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)
administration of orexin-A [21]. In our previous reports,
intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A suppressed cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage by regulating post-ischemic glucose
intolerance, which was achieved by improving impaired hepatic
insulin signaling [8]. In other reports, orexin-positive fibers are
shown to be distributed throughout the brainstem, including in
neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which is the
major source of parasympathetic innervation to peripheral tissues
(such as the liver), and neurons in the nucleus of solitary tract

Introduction
Stroke is a devastating disease and a leading cause of death and
severe disability worldwide [1]. Risk factors associated with stroke
include hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity [2,3]. Additionally, diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose metabolism (e.g. glucose
intolerance) are considered to ones of many important risk factors
[4]. Past studies have also suggested that hyperglycemia and/or
glucose intolerance following stroke may be associated with greater
mortality and reduced functional recovery [5,6]. In a focal
cerebral ischemic model, post-ischemic glucose intolerance is one
of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage [7,8,9]. However, the
mechanisms remain unclear.
Communication between the brain and peripheral tissues,
which occurs via the autonomic nervous system, may be essential
for maintaining systemic homeostasis, particularly glucose and
energy metabolism [10,11]. In the CNS, the anti-diabetic drug,
insulin, suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis via the hypothalamus
and vagus nerve [12,13]. The hepatic branch vagus nerve provides
the primary vagal innervation of the rat liver [14]. Therefore, the

(NTS) [18,19,22]. Hence, we hypothesized that regulation of postischemic glucose intolerance in subsequent suppression of developed ischemic neuronal damage showed orexin-A in hypothalamus may be mediated to vagus nerves projected from the medulla
oblongata to liver.
In the present study, we examined the influence of hepatic
branch vagus nerves projected from the medulla oblongata on the
recovery of post-ischemic glucose intolerance, and the neuroprotective effect of intrahypothalamic orexin-A administration.

allow reperfusion. Sham-operated mice received the same surgery
except the filament was not inserted. Body temperature was
maintained at 37.060.5uC by placing each mouse on a heating
pad (FH-100, Unique Medical, Osaka, Japan), which was
controlled by a rectal temperature probe (PTE-101, Unique
Medical) and a small animal heat controller (ATC-101B, Unique
Medical) during surgery and the recovery period. Relative cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) was measured by laser Doppler Flowmetry
(LDF) (TBF-LN1; Unique Medical) to assess the adequacy of the
vascular occlusion and reperfusion, as previously described [25].
MCAO is achieved by a decrease in rCBF to 40% of control
values, which is recovered to approximately 100% by reperfusion.
In addition, physiological parameters were measured before,
during and 30 min after MCAO using a sphygmomanometer
(TK-370C; BrainScience Idea, Osaka, Japan) and i-STAT (300F;
FUSO Pharmaceutical Industries, Osaka, Japan) [25]. Physiological parameters were within normal physiological ranges in all
animals at baseline, during MCAO, and during early reperfusion.
We eliminated mice with pricking brain on the silicon coated 8-0
nylon monofilament and unsuccessful infarction on day 3 after
MCAO. Thus, the final number of mice was described in each
legend. In addition, there are not dead mice by MCAO in present
study.

Materials and Methods
Animals
The present study was conducted in accordance with the
Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
adopted by the Japanese Pharmacological Society. All experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee for animals
at Kobe Gakuin University (approval number: A13-25). Experiments were performed on male ddY mice (5 weeks old, 25–30 g)
obtained from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Animals were housed
between 23–24uC on a 12-hr light–dark cycle (lights on 8:00 a.m.
to 8:00 p.m.). Food and water were available ad libitum.

Drug administration in hypothalamus or medulla
oblongata

Measurement of fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels

Intra-hypothalamic administration of 5 pmol/mouse orexin-A
(Wako, Osaka, Japan), dissolved in saline, was performed
immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
The selective non-peptide orexin-1 receptor antagonist inhibitor,
N-(2-methyl-6-benzoxazolyl)-N9-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl
urea
(SB334867) (Tocris Bioscience, St. Louis, MO, USA), was
dissolved in 1% DMSO and administered (intramedullary; 50 or
200 pmol/mouse) 30 min before saline or orexin-A intra-hypothalamic administration. The orexin-A and SB334867 doses and
the experimental schedule used here were chosen based on our
previous publication [8]. All intra-hypothalamic administrations
were performed as previously reported [8,23,24]. The administration volume for orexin-A and SB334867 was 0.2 mL/mouse.
Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and
immobilized on a stereotaxic instrument (SR-5M; NARISHIGE
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A microsyringe with a 30-gauge
stainless-steel needle was used for all experiments. As previously
reported [23,24] (but with some modifications), the needle was
inserted unilaterally into the hypothalamus (1.3 mm posterior to
bregma, 0.5 mm lateral from the midline and 5.7 mm deep) and
the medulla oblongata (7.8 mm posterior to bregma, 0.5 mm
lateral from the midline and 5.2 mm deep). The injection site of
the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata was confirmed with
0.5% trypan blue in saline (0.2 mL/mouse).

FBG levels were measured, according to previous reports [8,26].
Mice were fasted for 15 h and blood samples (,1.5 mL) were
obtained from tail veins. Plasma FBG was measured using the
Glucose Pilot (Aventir Biotech, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
increment in FBG was calculated using the following formula:
FBG increment = FBG on day 1 after MCAO – FBG before
MCAO (pre-MCAO FBG), as previously described [26]. The preMCAO FBG level was measured at 48 and 96 h before MCAO.

Measurement of infarct volume
Brains were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to determine infarct
volume, as previously demonstrated [8]. Mice were killed on day 3
after reperfusion, and brains were removed, cut (2-mm thick
coronal sections) and incubated in saline containing 2% TTC at
37uC for 10 min. Brain slices were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4uC overnight and scanned. Infarct volumes were
measured using the image analysis software, Image J (National
Institutes of Health, MD, USA), and Adobe Photoshop Elements
5.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, Tokyo, Japan), as previously
described [25]. The infarct volume was calculated based on infarct
area and intensity (intensity = white intensity of left hemisphere –
white intensity of right hemisphere) and according to trapezoid
formula.

Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia

Neurological examination

The experimental transient focal ischemia mouse model was
induced by performing MCAO, as described previously [25].
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (Abbott Japan,
Osaka, Japan) and maintained in an anesthetized state with 1%
isoflurane. The common carotid artery (CCA) and external carotid
artery were firstly ligated, followed by isolation of the internal
carotid artery (ICA). An 8-0 filament (Shirakawa, Fukushima,
Japan) coated with a 4-mm thin silicon coat tip (Provil novo
Medium; Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) was inserted into the
left ICA (advanced 9 mm) for 2 h to occlude the left middle
cerebral artery (MCA) at its origin through the bifurcation site of
CCA. Mice were then anesthetized again, and the occluding
filament was gently withdrawn back into the common carotid to
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

Neurological examinations were performed on day 3 after
reperfusion using the neurological deficit score (NDS), as previous
reported [8,25]. The NDS consists of consciousness (0, normal; 1,
restless; 2, lethargic; 3, stuporous; 4, seizures; and 5, death),
walking (0, normal; 1, paw; 2, unbalanced walking; 3, circling; 4,
unable to stand; and 5, no movement), limb tone (0, normal; 1,
spastic; and 2, flaccid), and the pain reflex. The pain reflex was
assessed by the tail flick test (pain reflex = latency on day 3 after
MCAO – latency before MCAO). NDS points were achieved from
the latency difference. A cut-off time of 10 s was used to prevent
any injury to the tail. Finally, NDS points assumed total point of
consciousness, walking, limb tone and the pain reflex.

active bands was analyzed using Cs-Analyzer software (Ver. 3.0)
(ATTO) and then normalized to the respective value for GAPDH.

Learning and memory tests
A one-trial step-through-type passive avoidance-learning test
was performed to examine learning and memory, as described
previously [26]. Briefly, the apparatus (Ohara Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) consisted of illuminated and dark compartments (each
4613610 cm) adjoining each other through a small gate (3 cm in
diameter) with a grid floor, 2.5 mm stainless steel rods set 7 mm
apart. In the training trial (2 days after MCAO), mice were placed
in the illuminated compartment facing away from the dark
compartment. An electric shock (50 V, 3 s in duration) was
delivered when mice entered the dark compartment. They were
then returned from the dark compartment to the home cage. In
the test trial (on day 3 after MCAO and at 24 h after the training
trial), mice were placed in the illuminated compartment, and the
latency time to enter the dark compartment (maximum of 600 s)
was measured.

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed, as described previously
[30] but with some modifications. Mice were perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4),
followed by 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS, 9 min after intrahypothalamic
administration of orexin-A or saline. The brains (which included
the medulla oblongata and hypothalamus) were then cut (2-mm
thick slices), and slices were incubated and fixed in ice-cold PBS
including 4% PFA at 4uC for 3 h, then dehydrated in 10%
followed by 20% sucrose for 3 h followed by overnight,
respectively at 4uC. Tissues were then embedded and frozen in
the Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura
Finetek Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and stored at 280uC until
future use. Frozen blocks were cut into 20 mm-thick sections with a
cryostat (Leica CM1850; Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and mounted on a MAS-coated glass slide (Matsunami
Glass Ind., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Sections were post-fixed in 10%
formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and subsequently
washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) 3 times at
5 min intervals. Sections were exposed to 3% BSA in PBS-T for
1 h at room temperature and then incubated (at 4uC for 48 h) with
the primary antibodies (in PBS-T with 1% BSA): goat anti-orexin1 receptor (1:100, Santa Cruz) or mouse anti-cholin acetyltransferase (ChAT; 1:200, Abcam). Sections were incubated (room
temperature, 2 h) with the secondary antibody (in 1% BSA): Alexa
Fluor 594 goat polyclonal anti-goat (orexin-1 receptor) or -mouse
(ChAT) IgG (1:200, Life Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Sections were then incubated (in PBS-T with 1% BSA, at 4uC for
24 h) with rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:2,000, Santa Cruz) for 24 h or
ChAT (1:200) for 48 h. Sections were then washed with PBS-T
and incubated (in 1% BSA, at room temperature for 2 h) with the
secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat polyclonal anti-rabbit
(c-Fos) or -mouse (ChAT) IgG (1:200, Life Technologies). After
washing, cover-slips were applied to the sections with Fluoromount/Plus (Thermo Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Immunoreactive signals were detected with a confocal laser
scanning microscope (FV1000, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan).

Locomotor activity
Spontaneous locomotor activity was quantified for 30 min by
the open field test, as previously described with some modifications
[27,28]. The open field box (30 cm630 cm630 cm) consisted of a
floor divided into 16 squares (7.5 cm67.5 cm/square) illuminated
by white light. Each mouse was gently placed in the very center of
the box and activity was scored as the number of line crossings (i.e.
when a mouse removed all four paws from one square and entered
another). The open field session was recorded by a camera and the
data was analyzed after the session. The open field arena was
cleaned with ethanol solution and let dry after testing each mouse.

Western immunoblot analysis
Western immunoblotting was performed, as described previously [23,25,29] but with some modifications. Briefly, the medulla
oblongata, liver and skeletal muscle were homogenized in
homogenization buffer and diluted with an equal volume of 26
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl
[pH 6.8], 10% SDS, 12% b-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 1%
bromophenol blue). Each sample was heated for 3 min at 97uC
and protein samples (30 mg) were separated via electrophoresis on
7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 15 V for
50 min. Membranes were blocked (60 min at room temperature)
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.6) with 0.1% Tween 20, and
either 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for insulin
receptor (InsR) and tyrosine-phosphorylated (p)-InsR, or 5% skim
milk (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) for orexin-1 receptor, the
gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and
GAPDH (loading control) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Inc.,
Osaka, Japan). Membranes were incubated with the primary
antibodies (in their corresponding blocking solution, overnight at
4uC): rabbit anti-InsR (1:1000, Abcam, Tokyo, Japan), rabbit antip-InsR (1:500, Abcam), goat anti-orexin-1 receptor (1:1000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit anti-PEPCK
(1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat anti-G6Pase (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-GAPDH (1:20,000,
Chemicon, CA, USA). Blots were then incubated (for 1 h at room
temperature) in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit
IgG (1:1,000, KPL, Guildford, UK) for InsR, p-InsR and PEPCK,
or anti-goat IgG (1:1000, KPL) for orexin-1 receptor and G6Pase,
and anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, KPL) for GAPDH. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
western immunoblotting substrate (Pierce; Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) followed by a Light-Capture instrument (AE6981; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The signal intensity of immunorePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

Selective hepatic branch vagotomy
Hepatic branch vagotomy was performed, as described
previously [31,32] but with some modifications. Mice were
anesthetized with pentobarbital (65 mg/kg), and the abdominal
wall was incised at the midline, the stomach pulled down and the
ligaments attaching the liver to the stomach severed. The anterior
ligament and the membranous connection of the left lobe of the
liver to the diaphragm were cut to provide better visibility of the
esophageal-hepatic attachments. The esophageal-hepatic attachment region contains a neurovascular bundle, including the
hepatic branch of the vagus nerve. The hepatic branch was
selectively transected. Sham vagotomy consisted of the same
surgical procedure except for transection of the vagus nerve.
MCAO was performed on mice and intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A or saline was administered on day 7 after
surgical recovery.

Statistical analysis
Infarct volume, FBG and quantification of western immunoblots were analyzed via a one-way ANOVA followed by the
Scheffe’s test and data are presented by the mean 6 SEM. The
NDS data and one-trial step-through passive avoidance data were
analyzed by the Steel-Dwass test with post-hoc nonparametric

multiple comparison tests, and data are presented as medians
(25th–75th percentile). Significance was reached at values of
p,0.05 or p,0.01.

Effect of hepatic branch vagotomy on orexin-A-mediated
suppression of FBG level and neuronal damage after
MCAO
The isolation of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve is shown
in Figure 6A. Hepatic branch vagotomy did not affect non-FBG
and FBG levels, body weight, food intake, drinking volume, and
the expression of InsR, p-InsR, PEPCK and G6Pase in liver or
skeletal muscle (Figure S5, S6). Compared with the saline-treated
group, hepatic branch vagotomy inhibited orexin-A-mediated
suppression of FBG levels on day 1 after MCAO (Figure 6B). In
addition, hepatic branch vagotomy inhibited orexin-A-mediated
suppression of infarct development, behavioral abnormality and
memory disturbance on day 3 after MCAO (Figure 6C–F).

Results
Effects of hypothalamic administration of orexin-A on
FBG levels and ischemic neuronal damage after MCAO
The injection site of orexin-A in the hypothalamus or
SB334867, orexin-1 receptor antagonist, in the medulla oblongata
was identified using trypan blue (Figure 1A). Orexin-A significantly suppressed the elevation of FBG levels on day 1 after
MCAO compared with the saline-treated group (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, orexin-A significantly suppressed the development of
infarction, increase of NDS score (neurological abnormalities) and
decrease of latency by step-through test (memory disturbances) on
day 3 after MCAO compared with the saline-treated group
(Figure 1C–F). Administration of SB334867 (200 pmol/mouse) in
the medulla oblongata significantly inhibited the effects of orexinA in the medulla oblongata (Figure 1). SB334867 did not affect
body weight, blood glucose levels, food intake, drinking volume,
and locomoter activity at 3 days or 7 days after administration of
saline (vehicle for orexin-A) or 1% DMSO (vehicle for SB334867)
(Figure S1). Expression of orexin-1 receptor was not affected by
intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A (Figure S2).

Effect of hepatic branch vagotomy on orexin-A-mediated
effects on InsR, p-InsR, PEPCK and G6Pase after MCAO
On day 1 of MCAO, orexin-A restored MCAO-mediated
reduction of hepatic and skeletal muscular protein expression of
InsR and p-InsR, and the increase of hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase
to control levels. This effect was significantly reversed by hepatic
branch vagotomy (Figure 7).

Discussion
In recent years, great attention has been given to the regulation
of glucose metabolism by not only the control from individual
peripheral tissues, such as the liver, but also by the interaction
between the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues [10]. Furthermore, the hypothalamus is the most important brain region for the
central regulation of glucose homeostasis, where various hormones
and neuropeptides cooperate to produce autonomic outflow to the
peripheral tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle [33,34,35].
Despite this association, its detailed mechanisms still remain
unclear.
We recently reported that the regulation of post-ischemic
glucose intolerance by intrahypothalamic administration of
orexin-A: (1) restored (to sham levels) the decrease of InsR and
the increase of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver, and (2)
significantly suppressed cerebral ischemic neuronal damage [8]. In
this study, intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A significantly increased c-Fos-positive cells in the NTS, which contains
the nucleus of the vagus nerve [18]. This result is supported by
previous reports demonstrating that i.c.v. administration of orexinA induces c-Fos activation of NTS neurons [36]. Other reports
have shown that orexin fibers are distributed throughout the
brainstem, including the dorsal motor nucleus of vague neurons
(DMN), which is the major source of parasympathetic innervation
to the peripheral tissues (such as the liver) and NTS in the CNS
[18,19]. In addition, orexin-A directly depolarizes the DMN
neurons [37]. The NTS (located in the dorsomedial medulla
oblongata) is widely accepted to be crucial for the integration of
hepatic control mechanisms [38]. Therefore, in the present study,
we hypothesized that hypothalamic orexin-A may regulate liver
function, such as glucose metabolism, through parasympathetic
nerves projected from the medulla oblongata. Thus, we studied the
mechanisms underlying the development of ischemic neuronal
damage and the role of post-ischemic glucose intolerance, focusing
on communication between the brain and peripheral tissues via
parasympathetic nerves.
Our findings reveal that the suppressive effect of hypothalamic
orexin-A on the development of post-ischemic glucose intolerance
and neuronal damage is mediated by orexin-1 receptor in the
medulla oblongata. Furthermore, this receptor mediates hepatic
InsR and gluconeogenic enzymes after cerebral ischemic stress.

Effects of hypothalamic administration of orexin-A on
hepatic and skeletal muscle expression of InsR, p-InsR,
PEPCK and G6Pase after MCAO
Compared with the sham group, protein expression of hepatic
InsR and p-InsR was significantly decreased on day 1 after
MCAO (Figure 2A, B), which was significantly inhibited by
orexin-A (Figure 2A, B). Compared with the sham group,
expression of hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase protein was significantly increased in the MCAO group (Figure 2C, D), which was
significantly decreased by orexin-A (Figure 2C, D). Similarly, in
skeletal muscle, MCAO-mediated decrease of InsR and p-InsR
levels on day 1 after MCAO was significantly suppressed by
orexin-A (Figure 2E, F). The effects of orexin-A were significantly
inhibited by administration of SB334867 (200 pmol/mouse) in the
medulla oblongata (Figure 2).

Co-localization of c-Fos and orexin-1 receptors after
intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A in the
medulla oblongata
c-Fos-positive cells were clearly observed in the medulla
oblongata (including the NTS) 90 min after intrahypothalamic
administration of orexin-A in this region, and was not seen in the
sham group (Figure 3A, D). Orexin-1 receptor positive cells were
detected in both saline- and orexin-A-treated groups (Figure 3B,
E). Furthermore, orexin-1 receptors were co-localized with c-Fospositive cells in the NTS of medulla oblongata (Figure 3C, F, and
Figure S3).

Co-localization of c-Fos or orexin-1 receptor with ChAT
after intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A in the
medulla oblongata
ChAT-positive cells were detected in the medulla oblongata
(including the NTS) in both saline- and orexin-A-treated groups
(Figure 4). Furthermore, ChAT-positive cells were co-localized
with c-Fos and orexin-1 receptors in the NTS of the medulla
oblongata (Figure 4, 5, and Figure S4).

LH, the PVN and ARC [43,44]. These areas are involved in
origin of sympathetic or parasympathetic (i.e. the vagus nerve)
signals to the liver or skeletal muscle [43,44]. In our preliminary
study, intrahypothalamic orexin-A activated LHA, ARC and
PVN-expressing neurons, which were all co-localized with the
orexin-1 receptor (data not shown). These results suggest that
orexin neurons projecting from the hypothalamus to the medulla
oblongata are involved in hypothalamic orexin-A-mediated effects
on liver function. However, whether hypothalamic orexin-A
affects liver function through the vagus nerve remains unclear.
Therefore, this association is under current investigations using
hepatic branch vagotomy mice in our group.
Vagus nerve efferents in the common hepatic branch are
important for the suppression of hepatic glucose production when
the hypothalamic nutrient sensor is stimulated by nutrient
repletion signals, such as insulin or fatty acid oxidation [13,35].
Insulin has been shown over recent years to be a critical

These results suggest that hypothalamic orexin-A may affect the
liver through the medulla oblongata, specifically the parasympathetic nerve (vagus nerve). Orexin-A has been shown to be densely
accumulated in the NTS and DMN, which are involved with
efferent parasympathetic nerves and thus more effectively the
vagus nerve to the liver [36,39]. Moreover, orexin-A activates
NTS neurons by modulating a nonselective cationic conductance
[40], suggesting that orexin-A may have a functional role in the
central parasympathetic nerve control of the NTS. Indeed,
hypothalamic orexin-A activated NTS and DMN neurons in the
medulla oblongata. Furthermore, these activated neurons were colocalized with orexin-1 receptor and ChAT (cholinergic neuronal
marker used for the vagus nerve [41,42]). Therefore, hypothalamic
orexin-A-induced effects on liver function (including insulininduced glucose metabolism) may be mediated by vagus nerves
expressing orexin-1 receptor in the NTS of the medulla oblongata.
In the hypothalamus, orexin receptors are highly expressed in the

nucleus of the vagus mediates hypothalamic insulin signaling via
ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, and reaches the liver via
the efferent vagus nerve [13]. Furthermore, activation of either
insulin signaling or KATP channels within the hypothalamus is
sufficient to decrease blood glucose levels by a substantial
inhibition of glucose production, which is largely due to a marked
decrease in the hepatic abundance of gluconeogenic enzymes,

metabolism [45]. Insulin modifies peripheral glucose metabolism
(especially liver glucose synthesis) through insulin receptors
localized in the hypothalamus [13,46]. Administration (i.c.v.) of
insulin increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, improved peripheral insulin action is associated with a
reduction in hepatic glucose production [13,46,47]. The motor

such as PEPCK and G6Pase [13,46,47]. Also, effects of central
insulin and systemic insulin on hepatic glucose production are
suppressed [48]. Therefore, activation of the hypothalamusmedulla oblongata-vagus nerve-liver axis is important for insulin
signaling on liver function. Changes in glucose uptake in
peripheral tissues after intrahypothalamic (VMH) administration
of orexin-A have shown that these orexin-A-affected tissues are
mediated by the activation of sympathetic nerve signaling with b2adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle [20]. Activation of LH and
VMH neurons may regulate InsR substrate activity and glucose
production in the liver and skeletal muscle via parasympathetic
and sympathetic neurons, respectively [49]. That is, it is through

that orexin-A is an important to regulate the glucose metabolism
in peripheral organs via the activation of the autonomic nervous
system. However, the role of endogenous orexin-A in the central
regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis and the vagus nerve
(including the hepatic branch vagus nerve) remains to be clarified.
Our findings are the first to show that hypothalamic orexin-A
affects the vagus nerve-liver axis, and regulates hepatic insulin
regulation. More specifically, hypothalamic orexin-A suppressed
post-ischemic glucose intolerance by decreasing hepatic InsR and
increasing gluconeogenic enzymes via vagus nerve signaling, and
also inhibited neuronal damage. In light with these results, other
reports have shown that hypothalamic orexin-A levels are

significantly decreased by cerebral ischemic stress [8]. These
results suggest that the development of post-ischemic glucose
intolerance may be involved in the reduction of hypothalamic
orexin-A-induced activation of orexin neurons projected from the

NTS of the medulla oblongata, causing weakness of vagus nerve
stimuli and thus, impairing liver function. However, further study
is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms of involvement.

Hepatic branch vagus nerve leads to the release of ACh, which
then binds to muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
[54,55]. Therefore, the regulatory mechanisms of liver function by
hypothalamic orexin-A may involve ACh and its receptor, and
STAT3. However, this mechanism is still controversial because

cholinergic signaling pathways have been reported to not mediate
the metabolic effects by the activation of hepatic vagal nerves [56].
However, little is known about the changes in the expression
levels of hepatic InsR. Previous reports have shown that
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) upregulates the
expression of insulin and insulin receptor [57,58]. Under
conditions activating insulin signaling, PTB promotes the stabilization of mRNAs encoding insulin and insulin receptor, and
enhances the translation of insulin receptor mRNA [57].
Furthermore, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (a family of
leucine-zipper transcription factors) regulate the transcription of
the InsR as part of a larger nuclear protein complex containing
transcription factors such as specific protein 1 [59]. Other reports
have demonstrated that TNF-a down-regulates insulin signaling
by increasing tyrosine phosphatase 1B [60], suggesting that
ischemic stress-mediated increases of inflammatory cytokines
may affect the transcription or degradation of the InsR.
In previous finding, orexin-1 receptor, a one of orexin-A
receptor, immunoreactivity in the cortex that vulnerable brain
region to ischemic stress was increased after cerebral ischemia [61]
and i.c.v. orexin-A suppressed the development of infarction
through increasing the cerebral blood flow [62]. In addition, in
others reports, the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of
orexin-A have been proved to be related with some intracellular
signal transduction pathway, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
[63]. That is, these reports suggest that indicated the neuroprotective effect of orexin-A was not only involved in the improvement of post-ischemic glucose intolerance, but also other factors
(including other neuroprotective mechanisms such as enhances the
cerebral blood flow and inhibits ischemic stress-induced increment
of HIF-1a).
In conclusion, these findings provide some insight into the
therapeutic effectiveness of this endogenous neuropeptide for its
communication between brain and peripheral tissues via the
